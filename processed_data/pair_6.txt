Greer?
Moving to Sweden.
I don't know.
Let's just take it easy here, alright? Nobody's gonna kill anybody.
Let's just take it easy here, alright? Nobody's gonna kill anybody.
Supposing he wants to get bad with us?
I say we off-load some of that gold now.
Would you hold on just a minute here, please? Look, there's no reason to panic now. Epps saw somebody. Fine. It's a big boat. Chances're real good he doesn't even know about the gold. If we stay cool, nobody'll be the wiser. The gold stays where it is til we're ready to go. Like I said, it'll be a hell of a lot safer
Pretty low all around.
We'll have to take it easy then. I don't think we'll find much aboard the ship, but it's probably worth looking around.
Ho-ly shit.
Couldn't have happened much more than a month ago.
Greek citizen. Merchant navy. Obviously we aren't the first to come across this ship. They probably stumbled across it just like we did.
And look what happened.
Maybe Epps's mystery man had something to do with it.
Maybe.
Never been more thirsty in my life.
Drink up then.
How're you feeling?
Lost my sea legs.
What happened?
You don't remember?
You don't remember?
Last thing I remember I was aboard the Chimera. Down somewhere in there scavenging around.

You've been out for about a day.

Say what?

Dodge found you out cold in one of the cabins.
Oh, man.
We heard you scream. Any idea what you might've seen?
We heard you scream. Any idea what you might've seen?
I wish I could tell you. I'd be real interested to know myself.
We're not gonna be able to pump it!
Alright. Everybody grab your gear! This' is where we get off!
We ain't exactly in what you'd call your high traffic neighborhood either.
The coast guard has our last position. They'll send somebody out soon enough. A ship this size you can't exactly miss.
Gettin' a little hot under the collar, I'd say.
Shut up.
Shut up.
Must be a little too the truth, eh Dodge?
It's a Noaa buoy.
A what?
A what?
Government weather. It's got a transmitter aboard.
We're still drifting.
The mooring hasn't come taught.
He took the shotgun and a light.
Must've heard something below deck and went down to check it out.
Can't find the shotgun.
So whoever did this now has our shotgun.

Doesn't look like it much matters.
What about the gold?
Leave it.
Leave it.
Now hold up just a minute. Let's be reasonable here.
Now hold up just a minute. Let's be reasonable here.
You think whoever did this is reasonable?
You think whoever did this is reasonable?
All I'm saying is that gold's worth a lot more to us now than it ever was.
Nobody's going anywhere with that gold now. Anybody tries to board, we'll know about it. You can do what you want, Greer. But neither of us is gonna risk saving your ass down here if it comes to that.
Fine with me.
What seems to be the trouble, ladies?
Whyn't you mind your own business, chief.
As I said, what seems to be the trouble?
Didn't you hear me, grandpa? Or you got your hearing aid turned down?
Didn't you hear me, grandpa? Or you got your hearing aid turned down?
I heard you. But I'm choosing to ignore you. Epps, let's go.
These ladies was having themselves a discussion and you're interrupting it.
You got about two seconds to get your paws off me, Tarzan.

Twenty. You knock off twenty and then we see. After my guy looks at it.
You're kidding, right?
You want fair pay, make hamburger for Mickey D. Otherwise, please to sign.
Have you seen my blue spatula?
Nope. What are you making, pancakes?
Nope. What are you making, pancakes?
Not if I don't find that goddamn spatula.
Will you get off my back for once?

Look, I told you I'm not going to college.

Well, I think it's good to keep all your options open. You can always enroll for the winter quarter. You could even live here and go to the city college part time, and still get a job if you wanted to.

Are you still looking for a job?

Tell her to forget it - I don't need her help.
Pumpkin? What's wrong?
Nothing.
It's nothing -- it's just some hormonal thing... don't worry about it...
I've got some important news to tell you, but it can wait till later if you're not feeling...
I've got some important news to tell you, but it can wait till later if you're not feeling...
What?
What?
Well... as you know, Maxine and I have been seeing a lot of each other, and we decided it might be a good idea for all of us if she came back here to live at the end of the Summer, just so we can all get to know each other and to make sure this is what we want.
Pumpkin, are you in there?
Are you going to yell at me?
Are you going to yell at me?
About what?

Yeah, I heard about that.

But I can't --

JUST DO IT!
That was great - jeez, thanks again for cooking all this.
Oh I love to cook. I guess most women wouldn't invite a man over on the first date, but I believe you should trust your instincts. When I talked to you on the phone you just seemed so... I don't know... harmless. Ready for ice cream?
Here we are... it's mocha mint from Lickety Splits. Oh, isn't that photograph just heart-rending?
Yeah ... where is this? Bosnia?
Yeah ... where is this? Bosnia?
Was it Bosnia? I forget... It's so sad, the tragedy of an entire country eloquently captured in the face of one little boy. A Soul/Funk song starts up on the radio that catches her attention. She goes over and turns it up.

Hey, it's nearly nine already - we're gonna have to leave now if we're going to make that movie.
Oh, all right... Party-pooper! Just let me put a few things away.
I'm so excited to see this film - Dustoffvarnya is such a brilliant director! Did you see his last film, The Flower That Drank The Moon? It was simply glorious!
Uh, no. I missed that one. But what do I know? I like Laurel and Hardy movies.
Uh, no. I missed that one. But what do I know? I like Laurel and Hardy movies.
Really? I never really cared for those. Why does the fat one always have to be so mean to the skinny one?

We're almost done. Hi. Yeah... no, it's excluded. They've already paid the earnest money... well, let them bring it up if they notice it at the final walk through. Right, great, sounds good!
Hey... so, what brings you down here?
I uh... I feel that I need to uh -- there's something I feel I have to say... I uh, I've never said this to anyone before -- believe me, I've stayed in horrible relationships for years just so I wouldn't have to do this, but I uh...

What are you trying to say?

I can't believe this! I thought at the very least a guy like you would never pull this kind of shit on me!
And what can you tell us about this...
Enid. It's sort of like a diary I guess.
Who is this, Enid?
It's supposed to be Don Knotts.

I see... interesting...
These are all valid comments, but I think we should see if the artist has anything to bring to this.
Well, I got the idea when I was doing some research and I discovered that Cook's Chicken used to be called Coon's Chicken, and so I decided to do my project based on this discovery as kind of a comment on racism... and the way racism is whitewashed over in our culture...

And how does an image like this help us to see that?
I'm not sure... I mean... I guess because when we see something like this it seems really shocking and we have to figure out why it's so shocking?
Enid, can I talk to you for a minute?
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh.
Don't worry - it's nothing bad. I was just wondering what your plans were for next year?

Well, I know this is really short notice, but I got a call from a very close friend at the Academy of Art & Design and she tells me that I'm allowed to place one student from your graduating class in a one year scholarship program... and, well, I hope you don't mind, Enid, but I took the liberty of submitting your name.
Hmm.

I'm sorry, Enid - you have to be an official high school graduate before I can nominate you. I had to give it to someone else... But I'm sure next year I can --
I'm gonna let you handle the four thirty crowd by yourself - that way I can evaluate your performance while it's slow and ease you into the bigger crowds.

Much later.
In fact, never.
What do you do if you're a satanist, anyway?
You know, sacrifice virgins and stuff...

"Authentic 50's diner"? Since when were there mini-malls in the 1950's?
God, it's so totally pathetic.
Who can forget this great hit from the 50's?
I feel as though I've stepped into a time warp!
Hi, Al!
Can we call you "Weird Al"?
I might actually get the pasta special.
You loser!
Did you notice all those weird things on the menu? Like "The Salad Explosion"?
I know... and instead of "dessert" it says "Mindbenders."

God, that's so pathetic. I bet she didn't even notice him.

I want to "make love" to him.
I'm going to tell him you said that.
SHUT UP!
She says she wants to MMPH!
Is he wearing a green cardigan?
What exactly is a cardigan anyway?
It's obviously him!
I can't believe it!
What's going on now? What's he doing?
Oh my god, he just ordered a giant glass of milk!

He's still just sitting there. God, this is totally unbearable!
Do you think he knows?
I dunno...
Are you sure?
Totally! Look!
He's insane!
We should follow him home.
He doesn't even look that bummed out, really.
I know... wouldn't you be totally pissed off?

This is way too creepy.
He won't see us... we'll just stalk him from a distance.

That's who people want to rent to. It's a known fact that it's way easier to get a job and everything if you're rich... All we have to do is buy a few semi-expensive outfits and act like it's no big deal... it'll be fun.

Well there's a few choice LPs in here that re-issue some really great old blues stuff.
Is this one any good?
Nah, it's not so great. Here's the one I'd recommend.
This track alone by Memphis Minnie is worth about $500 if you have the original 78. She was one of the greatest guitar players that ever lived, and a great singer and songwriter as well. I know the guy who owns the original and lent it for use on this reissue.
Wow!
How much is it?
A dollar seventy-five.
A dollar seventy-five.
Okay.
Yeah, it took a while before I got a chance to play it, but when I heard that song it was like --

You think it's healthy to obsessively collect things? You can't connect with other people so you fill your life with stuff... I'm just like all the rest of these pathetic collector losers.
No you're not! You're a cool guy, Seymour.

But, I...
But, I...
Shhh... I really need to get some sleep.
I really want to talk to you. I've been thinking about what you said about moving in here...
I can treat him any way I want to - I'm an adult! Leave me alone!
So what's the story with the two cheerleaders over here?
They're Seymour's.
They're Seymour's.
Seymour? You gotta be kidding me!
Seymour? You gotta be kidding me!
Don't worry about it. He's not gettin' any and neither are you.

Let me tell ya somethin', Joe... Listen to me, Joe... you can't hit a home run without swinging the bat!

Right.
Well, here's where the fun never stops!
Yeah, I'm really, really happy. Really having a good time.
Yeah, I'm really, really happy. Really having a good time.
Still torturing yourself over that Enid, huh?
Where else am I ever going to find another girl who likes Geeshie Wiley records? She could at least have the decency to call me back.
Maybe she was just using you to try and get back at some guy. Who knows? It could be a million things. It's wasted time trying to logically figure out the female brain, that's for sure.
Maybe she's got another boyfriend.
Yeah, well... thanks for cheering me up.
Yeah, well... thanks for cheering me up.
No problem.
Please Josh?
Forget it, there's no way... find some other poor sucker to abuse.
So Josh, if this guy freaks out, will you protect us?
He has every reason to freak out -- this is a totally fucked-up thing to do to somebody!
I agree.
I wish I could see him.
Did you remember to pay the phone bill?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Call me sometime.
I think that Phillip and Enid can help us to see that there are-many different ways we can express ourselves. We can do things like these cartoons that are amusing as a sort of light entertainment or we can do work that is more serious in scope and feeling and that deals with issues; emotional, spiritual, political; of great importance. I hope that you
I am.
I am.
Talk to us about it...

It's my response to the issue of a woman's right to choose... it's something I feel super-strongly about.

Isn't this a wonderful piece, class? This definitely falls into that higher category of art I was speaking of earlier.
What do we have here, Margaret?
It's a tampon in a teacup...
I can see that... now what can you tell us about it? First of all, what kind of sculpture is this?
It's a "found object"... that's when an artist takes an ordinary object and places it in an artistic context and thus it becomes art.

Very good. Now, what can you tell us about it in regard to your artistic intent?

I guess I see the teacup as a symbol for womanhood, because of tea parties in the olden days, but instead of tea I was trying to kind of confront people with this... like...

Uh... hi. Uh... Enid's stepmother told me I'd find her here?
She's not at home?
She's not at home?
No... they said she was here...
No... they said she was here...
What the fuck is she doing?! She was supposed to be here three hours ago!

Uh, do you mind if I wait? I really need to talk to her.

Why wouldn't she tell me? There's no way! She could never keep that to herself... you're crazy.

Really, I don't know enough about it to...

Why did you say she might be hiding from me? Did she say anything to you about me?

Yeah, she thinks you're a dork.

I have to admit, things have really started looking up for me since my life turned to shit.
So tell me more about this job. What exactly will you be doing?
So tell me more about this job. What exactly will you be doing?
Well, mostly archival research, cataloguing old records and writing liner notes for their CD reissues. It's really... I can't believe it.

It doesn't pay very much, but I should be able to afford my own place in a few months... Do you think that's too soon? I'm really anxious to get my record collection out of storage...

Why don't we start with that next week?
Thank you, doctor.
Don't thank me. You're doing all the work.
Seymour?
Yes?
Yes?
Do you have a check for me?
You were contracted to work-
-malaria epidemic; very sudden.

-oh, sing a different song, Abdullah- -there's nothing wrong with your men so stop telling me there is-
-you do not call me a liar- you know nothing of their health- consider yourself fortunate I persuaded so many to stay- consider yourself fortunate I have decided to stay-

You think you matter? -Beaumont is on that train- he matters-
He sees this chaos, he'll replace you all.
He'll replace you, too- that's all you really care about.
He'll replace you, too- that's all you really care about.
You think so? Fine. It's best you get out. Go. Tell all your people to go, run home where they'll be safe under the covers and when the bridge is built and the railroad is done, they can tell their women that out of all the thousands who worked here, they were the only ones to flee-
Morning, friend, glorious day.
As are they all.
The next time will be as this time- The Devil has come to Tsavo-
-that's ridiculous talk and you can't seriously believe it-
-that's ridiculous talk and you can't seriously believe it-
-now you're telling me my beliefs?- I don't think so-
I wasn't and you know it and don't push it- just listen- we have a problem in Tsavo-
-at last you're right- we do- you are the problem in Tsavo-
-at last you're right- we do- you are the problem in Tsavo-
-careful, Abdullah-
No hints, Samuel.
You don't know all that has happened here- the Devil has come to Tsavo.
You don't know all that has happened here- the Devil has come to Tsavo.
You're right. The Devil has come. Look at me. I am the Devil.
I am a man of peace.
Am I to take it you want to live?

Most certainly. Absolutely. Yes.

Excellent decision. Your name is Abdullah? I'm sure we'll meet again. Go and enjoy the splendid morning.

I think it's been a pleasure.
Starting now, we attack them.
How; we don't know where they are?
How; we don't know where they are?
We'll have to make them come to us, won't we? And since there are two of them, we're going to set two plans in motion. First: we must move the entire hospital by tomorrow night.
John Henry Patterson, come in. I'm Robert Beaumont. Firm- I like that, tells me a lot about you- -now why don't you tell me about me? To get you started, many people find me handsome, with a wonderful smile. I'm sure you agree. Winning personality, heaps of charm?
My wife is the game player in the family, sir.
My wife is the game player in the family, sir.
Games? Look at me closely, Patterson: I am a monster. My only pleasure is tormenting people who work for me, such as yourself. One mistake and I promise you this: I'll make you hate me.
-build the bridge over the Tsavo river. And be finished in four months time. Can you do that?
I'm sure you've examined my record. So you know I've never yet been late on a bridge.

Very moving, Patterson; I'm touched you confided in me. But I don't really give a shit about your upcoming litter. I've made you with this assignment- -don't make me break you.
Very moving, Patterson; I'm touched you confided in me. But I don't really give a shit about your upcoming litter. I've made you with this assignment- -don't make me break you.
You won't have the chance. Any further words of encouragement? Then I've a train to catch.
Pleasant journey?
How could it be? I hate Africa.
Lovely sound- they seem happy.
Don't they, though?
Don't they, though?
So work must be going well?
Truthfully? There has been the occasional odd hiccup- but then, as you so wisely told me, I'd never built in Africa.
But overall, you're pleased?
I do need to see Starling.
Starling?
Starling?
Awhile back he ordered some bibles- -I've brought them. Is he here?
Awhile back he ordered some bibles- -I've brought them. Is he here?
Yes he is.
Yes he is.
Well, I need to speak to him.
It's what the natives are calling the lions- -two lions have been causing trouble-
-what's the surprise in that, this is Africa?
-what's the surprise in that, this is Africa?
It hasn't been that simple so far.
It hasn't been that simple so far.
What have they done besides kill Starling? How many have they killed?
This is supposed to be salvation? What kind of idiocy are we dealing with here?
I'm calling it my "contraption"- we're going to surround it with a boma- a fence, to you- and we're going to leave a small opening opposite that door.
In that half will be bait- human bait- I'll start things off- -a sliding door will fit above that and a trip wire will run across the floor.
Genius- the beast will enter, tripping the wire, the door will slide down, trapping him, you, safe behind the bars, will have him at your mercy and will shoot him.
Are you running a high fever, man? How could you expect something as lunatic as this to succeed? How could you even conceive of it?
I didn't conceive of it for the lions- I built one in India when there was trouble with a tiger.
I didn't conceive of it for the lions- I built one in India when there was trouble with a tiger.
And it worked?
And it worked?
In point of fact, it didn't. But I'm convinced the theory is sound.
What?
I made a mistake hiring you- you're simply not up to the job.
I made a mistake hiring you- you're simply not up to the job.
You genuinely enjoy trying to terrify people, don't you? Well, fine- -except there isn't a higher rated engineer and we both know that. And since time is so important to you, how long do you think it would take to find someone else qualified and bring him here?
Let me explain about time- you've been here three months and already two months behind. And the Germans and the French are gearing up. And I don't care about you and I don't care about the thirty dead- I care about my knighthood and if this railroad finishes on schedule, I'll get my knighthood and I want it. Professional hunters may be the answer.
All they'll bring is more chaos and we've plenty of that already- and if they come in, word will get out- and what happens to your knighthood then?

Very well, the job's still yours, I'll go. But if I have to return, you're finished. And I will then do everything I can to destroy your reputation. Am I not fair? Told you you'd hate me.
Understand, I had help-
-not a time for modesty, Bob-
This sham? Ridiculous. Who needs it? It's only being built to control the ivory trade, make men richer.
Then why do you stay?
Then why do you stay?
Who else would hire me? Beat you to it, didn't I? Oh yes, almost forgot- brought you a little welcoming gift.
I know it's your first day and of course you must be tired from the journey- -but what are you going to do about it?
Karim will have to show me where it happened. And of course, I'll need the donkey. With any luck, I'll sort it out tonight.
You're certain about tomorrow? But you don't seem excited.
You don't enjoy killing, do you?
You don't enjoy killing, do you?
Then why do it?
I'm David Hawthorne, this is my hospital. And my advice to you is, "don't get sick in front of it." That was meant to be charming, sorry. I seem to have lost the knack.
You never had it.
You never had it.
Nigel and I don't like each other much.
A man-eater attacks and you're such a buffoon you almost forget to mention it?
Well, he got away, didn't he? Riding a donkey not far from here when the lion sprang on them- donkey took the brunt of it- then suddenly the lion ran off.
-then he feasted on him, starting with his feet-
-please- you needn't be so graphic-
-please- you needn't be so graphic-
You intend "sorting this out" tonight?
That's a terrible idea-
-is it, I'm sorry, but then, of course, you're the doctor, you should know.

Silliest thing I ever heard of- why in the world should we go through all that?

I suppose I could answer you. I suppose I could explain that the place is so inviting, what with the smell of blood and flesh, that they have to strike. It's even possible that I tell you I found some fresh paw marks around back which means they're already contemplating feasting here. But I don't want to answer you because when you question me

I have been desperate for Patterson to let me move the hospital since the day he arrived.

It was embarrassing- the man showered me with compliments.
Oh dear- -you're geting that downtrodden look again-
-well, it's just... ...other men don't abandon their wives at such a time-
-well, it's just... ...other men don't abandon their wives at such a time-

What if there are complications?-
What if there are complications?-
-not "what if"- there will be, there always are. Which only means that our "son" and I- note my confidence- will have an excuse to come visit.
Go, now. Such a gentleman.
I am desperate to see Africa- but I hate the leaving.
Very good indeed.
We have hunted since childhood.

All right- you'll spend your nights inside. You'll have plenty of ammunition. You're totally protected, you have really nothing to fear.

-well, of course he kept moving- but he couldn't have been more than ten feet away from the three of you- surely you must have wounded the thing-
I assure you we came close many times-
Many thanks. You're Patterson, yes? Nigel Starling- I'll be assisting you at Tsavo- but surely Beaumont must have told you that.
He just gave me his "monster" speech.
He just gave me his "monster" speech.
That. I know Robert seems dreadful, but when you truly get to know the man, well, he's much worse. And I'm one of his defenders. Forget him for now- it's your first ride to Tsavo- I think you'll find it breathtaking.
Don't much like them.
The females are bigger- only animal here like that- have to be or they wouldn't survive because the males eat the young.
Anything special about them?
Just that they fart through their mouths. Must make kissing something of a gamble.

I've lived in Africa a year and I don't know what you know. How long have you been here?
I've lived in Africa a year and I don't know what you know. How long have you been here?
Almost three hours. But I've been getting ready all my life.
Every time I see something like that, I know we're right to be here- to bring Christianity into their lives, enrich their souls.
Beaumont says it's to end slavery.

We all have our reasons. Mine is simply to make them understand happiness, accept salvation, know the serenity that comes- -best I stop. One of the by-products of my belief is that I can become amazingly boring. But I know God smiles on me.

Have you got that in writing?
Samuel is camp liaison- absolutely indispensable- the only man here everyone trusts.
Does he speak English?
Excellent. Could I see the bridge site?
I've got medical supplies to deliver. Come along to the hospital when you're done.
Finish your tour?
And anxious to get started. What is this, mostly malaria?
And anxious to get started. What is this, mostly malaria?
Yes- but their suffering is only transitory- once they except God into their hearts, He will vanquish all pain.
I couldn't believe it when you said "sort it out." As if it were the most normal thing in the world. "Ho-hum, what lovely tea, I think I'll bag a killer beast this evening, nothing much else going on anyway."
Well, he put me in a spot, didn't he? But that's all right- after all, I'm responsible for everything that happens here. And it certainly won't do much for morale if a man-eater's on the prowl.
You said "of course" you'd need the donkey. Why "of course"?
We know three things about man-eaters. First, they always return to where they've attacked before. Second, they're always old- they can't catch other animals so they turn to us. And third, they're always alone- they've been cast out by their pride because they can't keep up.
I don't suppose I could watch.
Might be exciting for you.

Well, why not? You seem so calm and experienced. Why not, indeed!
I hate to be a bother, John, but the cramp's getting worse. The pain is actually quite unbearable now.
Shhh.
Shhh.
I'm sure you mean that to be comforting, but-
I'm sure you mean that to be comforting, but-
-you'll have to deal with it, Nigel.
-you'll have to deal with it, Nigel.
That is precisely my plan- but back in my tent.
John? I know this isn't the time to ask, but-
What?
What?
Since you'd only been here three hours when we met, are you sure this is how you hunt lions?
Since you'd only been here three hours when we met, are you sure this is how you hunt lions?
Not to terrify you, Nigel, but it's worse than you think- I've never even seen one.
...one shot...
So that's what a lion looks like.
With much more on the way- -John- we could have had this chat on flatter ground-
-true enough- but without the comedy relief.
How lucky we are.
Aren't we full of ourselves today? I think it's because of the lion.
Aren't we full of ourselves today? I think it's because of the lion.

All right- thee second embankment will go there.
You do plan to mark it a bit more precisely than just- -"there."

John, it will not be easy.

Nigel, you'll just have to use your hands-
I'll try- but this feels so different- that old lion I killed could never carry off a man Singh's size.
But you said they were always old.
But you said they were always old.
That's what the books say...
Second death? Where?-
-far end of camp- man wandering alone at night. Hawthorne's examining the body now. There's even less of him than of Singh.

But it's crazy- the lion shouldn't be that hungry this soon. Samuel?
What a good week.
You mean nobody died?
You mean nobody died?
We all worked together. Worthy deeds were accomplished. I liked the labor. My mother insisted on piano lessons- broke the dear woman's heart when I turned out to be tone deaf- but she still was always at me about being careful with my hands. I like the blood, is that strange?
I didn't have a chance to thank you.
What did I do?
What did I do?
Got me out of trouble.
Got me out of trouble.
Nonsense- Samuel would have done something.

We need to talk.
We need to talk.
Let me save time- you are the engineer; you are in charge; you're sorry I'm here. Right so far? Good- because I am not an engineer, I don't want to be in charge, and I'm sorrier than you are that I'm here- I hate Tsavo. So I will help you by killing the lions and leaving, and you will help me by doing what

Actually, no.
All right- let's go into battle. I'm Redbeard.
All right- let's go into battle. I'm Redbeard.
Somehow I guessed.
I don't really. But understand something- even though it may take me two or three days to sort this out- -when I'm gone, you'll still have to build the bridge. And I don't want the men to have lost respect for you.
That's very considerate.
That's very considerate.
I'm always considerate- my mother taught me that.
Have you got it?
No, but you do- -see, you were needed after all. And fifty warriors at the camp before dawn.
The best way to ensure the kill when you're using trackers is for one to shoot while the other uses the trackers to force the lion toward the shooter. Have you ever led trackers?
I can try.
I can try.
Samuel says you killed a lion.
Samuel says you killed a lion.
It was probably luck- I'd rather you did the shooting.
It was probably luck- I'd rather you did the shooting.
You'd never force the lion to me- and nobody ever got a lion with one shot by luck. Around there's a clearing- you'll know it from the anthills- get there and hide and listen to the sounds- I'll make the lion come directly to you.
...misfire... it jammed...
Has it ever done that before?
Has it ever done that before?
...don't know...
Think about something else.
Have you ever failed?
Have you ever failed?
Only in life...
Goddammit!
It's all right. Stay ready. They know it's there.
Meant to ask you- the railroad car trap. Your idea? Excellent notion- I used the same device myself once.
But of course yours worked.
But of course yours worked.
In point of fact it didn't- but I'm convinced the idea is sound.
It would have been a beautiful bridge, John. I never noticed before, occupied with other business, I suppose... ...never really pay much attention to that kind of thing but I've had the time today, nothing else on, and this... it's graceful and the placement couldn't be prettier... and...
You just got hit. The getting up is up to you- but they're only lions- -and I'm going after them crack of dawn...
In my town, when I was little, there was a brute, a bully who terrorized the place. But he was not the problem. He had a brother who was worse than he. But the brother was not the problem. One or the other of them was usually in jail. The problem came when they were both free togther. The two became different from either
What happened to them?
What happened to them?
I got big.
Their den? Have you ever seen anything like this?
Nobody's seen anything like this. Lions don't have caves like this- -they're doing it for pleasure.
Where could it have gone? How could it get across the water? They're only lions, yes?
Don't they have to be?...
They're used to people in trees, not in a clearing. It may be tight.
Not for me- I'm too bulky and it's your idea, you go up there. Take the others to the water tower for the night.
Not for me- I'm too bulky and it's your idea, you go up there. Take the others to the water tower for the night.
I'll be bait alone?
I'll be bait alone?
Yes. And I'll be in some distant tree where I can provide no assistance whatsoever. Can you control your fear?
Yes. And I'll be in some distant tree where I can provide no assistance whatsoever. Can you control your fear?
I'll have to.
I'll have to.
I can't control mine- I'd be lost without the shame factor driving me.
I can't control mine- I'd be lost without the shame factor driving me.
Was that supposed to make me feel better?
It's certainly the best chance they've had to kill you.
You think they'll come then? Why?
You think they'll come then? Why?
Good luck.
Good luck.
Why?
Why?
Because I think they're after you.
How many do you think they've killed?
The most of any lions... a hundred...? Probably more. Johnny...?
I never thought I'd say this, but I'm glad you came.
Understood- you realize now you could never have done it without me.
Understood- you realize now you could never have done it without me.
Actually, I could have done it much more easily without you, but for whatever reason, I'm glad you came.
Why do the workers look unhappy?
Because they are here. Because Tsavo is the worst place in the world. Come, John- to the bridge.
It's all wonderfully under control, Samuel- you've done a splendid job.
Thank you. The truth is this: you have to work at it constantly.
Thank you. The truth is this: you have to work at it constantly.
The workers don't get on?
The workers don't get on?
Get on? They detest each other. Obviously the Africans hate the Indians. But the Indians also hate the other Indians. Some of them worship cows, while others eat them.
Did it look like this in your mind?
This is more difficult-
I am also liaison between these two.
Clearly you don't agree about building the railroad?
What are they looking at?
You- they cannot believe you're still here.
You- they cannot believe you're still here.
Nonsense.
Nonsense.
You don't know what Tsavo means, do you? It means "slaughter"...
We should construct thorn fences around every tent area. Fires burning at night.
Fine. Get started. And a strict curfew- no one allowed out at night. Send half your men to the bridge, the rest with these two. And I'm sorry for my tone earlier. But I repeat- there is no reason for fear. I will kill the lion and I will build the bridge.
Oh yes, I think so.
Look out, Samuel, here it comes.
For you.
Thank you, Samuel.
Thank you, Samuel.
Good news?
Good news?
I expect so- it's from my wife.
I expect so- it's from my wife.
Do you love her?
Do you love her?
I do, actually; very much.
I do, actually; very much.
You give me hope, John.
Soon.
I have to ask- why do you need me?
You like him, don't you?
Oh yes. But it takes time.
Oh yes. But it takes time.
You've known him long?
You've known him long?
Since his beard was red.
Thank you. Why does he need you by him?
He doesn't. He needs nobody. But we have hunted many times... ...he knows I am afraid of lions...
Three years I've worked for the railroad. Now I don't know why. It seemed a good idea once.
I feel the same about the bridge. This country certainly didn't ask for it, doesn't need it.
He has children?
Once...
Where is it?
Underneath. Somewhere.
Afraid of lions.
It's all right, Samuel- we all get hit-
Why do you laugh?- you don't believe she taught me?
I don't believe you had a mother.
How many cattle?
Four should do it.
Four should do it.
They will want a lot of money.
Why so many?
Because I have two plans to kill the lions- one involving the cattle, the other the men.
Did you ever see a lion that size?
Not even close. What happened?
Gentlemen, there's no sickness smell at all here, and little blood. When we leave, close the gate securely, don't open it til morning and keep your fires high. Any questions, ask them now. You two will sleep beautifully in your tents. And stay there.
And where will you sleep beautifully?
And where will you sleep beautifully?
Patterson and I will be in the old hospital- where the enticing smell of sickness still lingers- -and by the time we're done, I promise you, the odor of blood will be irresistible.
Where do you go next?
Some Russian princes want to hunt the Himalayas. You?
Some Russian princes want to hunt the Himalayas. You?
Help finish the railroad.
My life was shaped because someone invented gunpowder. Our lives have crossed because two lions went mad. But what if in the future the three of us do something grand for humanity? Was that worth all the lives? Too soon to tell.
Some mysteries should not have solutions.

Hold your son high.
Oh, yes, I got in a little late this morning, Janosz.
You know, you are really doing very good work here. I think soon you may be ready to assist me in some of the more important restorations.

Thank you, Janosz. I've learned a lot here, but now that my baby's a little older, I was hoping to rejoin the orchestra.
We'll be very sorry to lose you. Perhaps I could take you to lunch today?
Actually, I'm not eating lunch today. I have an appointment. In fact, I'd better go.
Every day I ask you, and every day you've got something else to do. Do I have bad breath or something?
I'm sorry. Perhaps some other time.
I'm sorry. Perhaps some other time.
Okay, I'll take a raincheck on that.
Janosz?
Hello, Dana. I happened to be in the neighborhood and I thought I'd stop by to see if everything's all right with you -- you know, with the blackout and everything? Are you okay? Is the baby all right?
Do you need anything? You want me to come in?
No, everything's fine. Honestly. Thanks anyway.
No, everything's fine. Honestly. Thanks anyway.
Okay, just thought I'd check. Good night, Dana. Sleep well. Don't let the bedbugs bite you.
Okay, just thought I'd check. Good night, Dana. Sleep well. Don't let the bedbugs bite you.
Good night, Janosz.
Dana, aren't you going to introduce me to your friend?
Oh, I'm sorry. This is Peter Venkman. Peter, Janosz Poha.
What do you want with my baby?
No harm will come to the child. You might even say it's a privilege. He will be the vessel for the spirit of Vigo. And you -- well, you will be the mother of the ruler of the world. Doesn't that sound nice?

I don't care who he is. He's not taking my baby.
Time is running out, Dana. Soon it will be midnight and the city will be mine -- and Vigo's. Well, mainly Vigo's. But we have a spectacular opportunity to make the best of our relationship.
We don't have a relationship.
We don't have a relationship.
I know. Marry me, Dana, and together we will raise Vigo as our son. There are many perks that come with being the mother of a living god. I'm sure he will supply for us a magnificent apartment. And perhaps a car and free parking.

I hate and despise you and everything you stand for with all my heart and soul. I could never forgive what you've done to me and my child.

I'd rather not.
Hundreds of people. Believe me, I didn't imagine this.
I'm not saying you did. In science we always look for the simplest explanation.
What are you working on, Egon?
I'm trying to determine whether human emotional states have a measurable effect on the psychomagnetheric energy field. It's a theory Ray and I were working on when we had to dissolve Ghostbusters.
We'll do the happiness index next. I'd like to bring Ray in on your case, if it's all right with you.
Okay, whatever you think -- but not Venkman.

Hello, Peter.
You know, Dana, I'm very very hurt that you didn't call me first. I'm still into all this stuff, you know. Haven't you ever seen my show?
You know, Dana, I'm very very hurt that you didn't call me first. I'm still into all this stuff, you know. Haven't you ever seen my show?
I have. That's why I didn't call you first.
I have. That's why I didn't call you first.
I can see that you're still very bitter about us, but in the interest of science, I'm going to give it my best shot. Let's go to work, boys.
So what happened to Mr. Right? I hear he ditched you and the kid and moved to Europe.
He didn't "ditch" me. We had some problems, he got a good offer from an orchestra in England and he took it.

I may have a few personal problems but one thing I am is a total professional.
What do you think?
There's no doubt about it. He's got his father's looks. The kid is ugly -- extremely ugly. And smelly. You stink! It's just horrible. You are the stinkiest baby I ever smelled. What's his name?

Unusual? I don't know. I haven't had a lot of experience with babies.
I'll do it.
I'll supervise.
Brings back a lot of sweet memories, doesn't it? There's our old cash machine. And the dry cleaners we used to go to. And the old video store. We really had some good times, didn't we?
We definitely had a moment or two.
That's where the buggy stopped.
Okay, let's take a look.
I wish I could stay. I feel personally responsible for you being here.
You are personally responsible. If I can get conjugal rights, will you visit me at Sing Sing?

So this is what you do, huh?
Oh, hello, Peter.

You're really good, you know.
You're really good, you know.
I didn't paint it. I'm just cleaning it. It's an original Ver Meer. It's worth about ten million dollars.
I'm sure you didn't come here just to talk about art.
As a matter of fact, I stopped by to tell you that I haven't forgotten your problem and that we're still on the case.
He was also a lunatic and a genocidal madman. I hate this painting. I've felt very uncomfortable since they brought it up from storage.
Yeah, it's not the kind of thing you'd want to hang in the rec room. You know what it needs? A fluffy little white kitten in the corner.
I may be wrong, but I think you've got a little crush on this guy.
Good-bye, Peter.
Good-bye, Peter.
I'd like to stay, but I really don't have time to hang around here. I'll call you. Later, Johnny!
I'm sorry. Were you on your way out?
No, I just got in -- a couple hours ago. Come on in. Are we having a pajama party?
No, I just got in -- a couple hours ago. Come on in. Are we having a pajama party?
Peter, the bathtub tried to eat Oscar.
You know, if anyone else told me that, I'd have serious doubts. But coming from you, I can't honestly say I'm surprised.
I must be losing my mind. At the museum today I could have sworn that terrible painting of Vigo looked right at me.

I'll get Ray and Egon to check out the bathtub. You better stay here.
This is Joe Namath's old number, you know. You could get a lot of chicks with this. Just don't pee in it.
Peter, what about the bathtub?
Peter, what about the bathtub?
We'll take care of that. Ray, Pete. Listen, get over to Dana's right away ... Her bathtub pulled a fast one -- tried to eat the kid.

Sounds like another slime job ... No, they're all right. They're here now ... Right ... Let me know.
Bathroom's right here -- let me just tidy up a few things.
Peter, this is very nice, but you don't have to do any of this, you know.
Be careful on that sofa -- it's a butt-biter. But the bed's good and I just changed the sheets so if you get tired, feel free. In fact, I think you should definitely plan on spending the night here.
Really? And how would we handle the sleeping arrangements?
Really? And how would we handle the sleeping arrangements?
For me it's best if I sleep on my side and you spoon up right behind me with your arms around me. If we go the other way I'm afraid your hair will be getting in my face all night.

I'll put him down for you. You are way too short! And your belly-button sticks out! You're nothing but a burden to your poor mother!
Are you all squeaky clean now?
Yes, I'm very clean. Did they find anything at my apartment?
They didn't find anything? In the bathtub ... the pink ooze ... nothing? So, what do I do now?
Now you get dressed and we go out. I got a babysitter and everything. Trust me, you need it.

I put them in your hamper. I thought they were dirty.

Maybe I should call Janine.
Don't worry. Janine has a very special way with children.
I think he likes you. I think I do too.
Finally came to your senses, huh?
That's not true. It was 1620.
Same difference.
That's a terrible thing to say.
So what? It's a free country. Thanks, Lib.
Hi, Ray. It's good to see you. Thanks for coming.
No problem. Always glad to help -- and hug.
No problem. Always glad to help -- and hug.
Hi, Egon.
Is this the spot?
A little to the left. Right there! That's where it stopped.
I think we hit the honeypot, boys. There's something brewing under the street.
Peter, do you think maybe I have some genetic problem or something that makes me vulnerable to these supernatural things.
Sorry!
Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else.
According to my sources, the world will end on February 14, in the year 2016.
Valentine's Day. That's got to be a bummer. Where did you get that date, Elaine?

I received this information from an alien. I was at the Paramus Holiday Inn, I was having a drink in the bar when he approached me and started talking. Then he must have used some sort of ray or a mind control device because he made me follow him to his room and that's where he told me about the end of the world.

No, you can't, and I think that's the whole problem with aliens; you just can't trust them. You may get some nice ones occasionally like Starman or E.T., but most of them turn out to be some kind of lizard. Anyway, we're just about out of time. Next week on 'World of the Psychic,' hairless pets. Until then, this is Peter Venkman saying ...
Can I help you?
Yeah, you can get your hand off my chest.
I'm Jack Hardemeyer. I'm the mayor's assistant. What can I do for you?
I'm an old friend of the mayor's. I just want to say hello to him.

I know who you are, Doctor Venkman. Busting any ghosts lately?

No, that's what I want to talk to the mayor about. We did a little job for the city a while back and we ended up getting sued, screwed and tattooed by deskworms like you.
Look, you stay away from the mayor. Next fall, barring a disaster, he's going to be elected governor of this state and the last thing we need is for him to be associated with two-bit frauds and publicity hounds like you and your friends. You read me?
That's quite a story.
Yeah, I think the Times might be interested, don't you? The Post might have a lot of fun with it, too.
Before you go running to the newspapers with this, would you consider telling this slime thing to some people downtown?
Now you're talking.
Look, I've had it with you. Get your stuff together, get back in that clown car and get out of here. This is a city matter and everything's under control.
Oh, you think so? Well, I've got news for you. You've got Dracula's brother-in-law in there and he's got my girlfriend and her kid. Around about midnight tonight, when you're partying uptown, this guy's going to come to life and start doing amateur head transplants. And that's just round one.
What is it, honey?
It's that darn ghost again! I don't know what to do anymore. He just won't leave us alone. I guess we'll just have to move.
It's that darn ghost again! I don't know what to do anymore. He just won't leave us alone. I guess we'll just have to move.
Don't worry. We're not moving. He is.
Who are you going to call?
Ghostbusters.
Oh migod! I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that. It was an accident.
What are you doing up here?
What are you doing up here?
I was trying to get that smelly green thing. The guys asked me to help out. I'm like the fifth Ghostbuster.

Why would you want to be a Ghostbuster if you're already an accountant?
Why would you want to be a Ghostbuster if you're already an accountant?
Oh, no, it's just if one of the guys calls in sick or gets hurt.
Have you made any plans yet? You know tomorrow is New Year's Eve.
No, I celebrate at the beginning of my corporate tax year which is March first. That way I beat the crowds.
No, I celebrate at the beginning of my corporate tax year which is March first. That way I beat the crowds.
That's very practical. I hate going out on New Year's Eve, too.
Well, good night, Louis.
Janine, do you feel like maybe getting something to eat on the way home?
Janine, do you feel like maybe getting something to eat on the way home?
I'd like to, but I told Dr. Venkman I'd babysit. Do you want to babysit with me?
I'd like to, but I told Dr. Venkman I'd babysit. Do you want to babysit with me?
Oh, sure, that sounds great.
I can't believe a person could actually live like this.
So these dwarfs had a limited partnership in a small mining operation and then one day a beautiful princess came to live with them.

So they bartered room and board in exchange for housekeeping services, which was a good deal for all of them because then they didn't have to withhold tax and social security, which I'm not saying is right but it's just a story, so I guess it's all right. I can finish this later if you're tired.
You're really good with children, Louis. I can tell. Why don't you come here and sit with me?
Okay.
Motherhood is a very natural instinct for me. I'd like to have a baby myself. Wouldn't you?
Tonight?
Should we go?
I don't think we should leave her alone.
I don't think we should leave her alone.
You're right. We should stay.
I'm not sure this is such a good idea? Do they know you're doing this?
Oh, yeah, sure -- no. But there's really not much to do here and they might need some back-up at the museum.
Oh, yeah, sure -- no. But there's really not much to do here and they might need some back-up at the museum.
You're very brave, Louis. Good luck.
Pleasure to meet you. I've seen you on television.
How are you? What's that you're working on, Johnny?
It's a painting I'm restoring for the new Byzantine exhibition. It's a self-portrait of Prince Vigo, the Carpathian. He ruled most of Carpathia and Moldavia in the 17th Century.
Too bad for the Moldavians.
Too bad for the Moldavians.

We don't go around altering valuable paintings, Dr. Venkman.
Well, I'd make an exception in this case if I were you.
I'll let you get back to it. Nice meeting you.
My pleasure.
Dr. Venkman? Dana is not here.
I know.
I know.
Then why have you come?
Then why have you come?
We got a major creep alert and we're just going down the list. Your name was first.
You know, I never got to ask you. Where you from, Johnny?
The Upper West Side.
This is the one that looked at Dana.
It must be the chemical fumes in the studio. People start imagining things --

I'm going to rule out the glue-sniffing theory. If she says it looked at her, it looked at her. Hey, you! Vigie! Look at me. I'm talking to you. Hey! Look at me when I'm talking to you.
So you see, everything is in order, is it not?
Not. Don't leave town and report any change in your address to the proper authorities. We'll be back.
You pitiful, miserable creatures! You dare to challenge the power of darkness? Don't you realize what you are dealing with? He's Vigo! You are like the buzzing of flies to him.
Oh, Johnny. Did you back the wrong horse.
I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia, the sorrow of Moldavia, command you.
Command me, lord.
Command me, lord.
On a mountain of skulls in a castle of pain, I sat on a throne of blood. What was will be, what is will be no more. Now is the season of evil. Find me a child that I might live again.
I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia --
Yes, the scourge --
Yes, the scourge --
-- the sorrow of Moldavia --

I await the word of Vigo.

The season of evil begins with the birth of the new year. Bring me the child that I might live again.

Lord Vigo, the mother, Dana, is fine and strong. I was wondering -- well, would it be possible -- if I bring the baby, could I have the woman?
Lord Vigo, the mother, Dana, is fine and strong. I was wondering -- well, would it be possible -- if I bring the baby, could I have the woman?
So be it. On this the day of darkness, she will be ours, wife to you and mother to me.
Keep that up, mister, and I'll find you in contempt.
Sorry, your Honor, but when somebody sets me up like that I can't resist.
You've got to do something!
Who are they?
Who are they?
They're the Scoleri Brothers. I tried them for murder. They were electrocuted up at Ossining in '48. Now they want to kill me.
They're the Scoleri Brothers. I tried them for murder. They were electrocuted up at Ossining in '48. Now they want to kill me.
Maybe they just want to appeal.
These boys aren't playing around.
You've got to stop them. Please!
The witness is leading him. Sustained.
Okay, let me rephrase that question. Didn't you once coach a basketball team for underprivileged children?
Sustained. Mr. Tully, do you have anything to ask this witness that may have some bearing on this case?
Do I?
Your honor, may I approach the bench?
Yes.
Can I have some of your water?
Get on with it, counselor!
Get on with it, counselor!
Your honor, ladies and gentlemen of the -- audience. I don't think it's fair to call my clients frauds. Okay, the blackout was a big problem for everybody. I was stuck in an elevator for about three hours and I had to go to the bathroom the whole time, but I don't blame them because once I turned into a dog and they helped
That's it? That's all you have to say?
Did I forget something?
Come on, Sherm. You're my cousin. Do this for me. I'm begging you.
I can't do it, Louis. It isn't ethical. I could lose my license.
I can't do it, Louis. It isn't ethical. I could lose my license.
Why can't you just have them released? You're a doctor.

Sherman, I've done lots of favors for you.

Like what?

I got you out of those bad tax shelters.

You were the one who got me in.

I fixed you up with Diane Troxler and she put out, didn't she?
I fixed you up with Diane Troxler and she put out, didn't she?
Yeah, I had to give her free dermabrasion for a year. Forget it, Louis. I could get in a lot of trouble.
Yeah, I had to give her free dermabrasion for a year. Forget it, Louis. I could get in a lot of trouble.
I'm telling you, we're all going to be in big trouble if we don't do something fast. That ghost guy came and took my friend's baby and we got to get it back. It's just a scared little baby, Sherm.
I'm telling you, we're all going to be in big trouble if we don't do something fast. That ghost guy came and took my friend's baby and we got to get it back. It's just a scared little baby, Sherm.
Then you should go to the police. I don't believe in any of that stuff.
This is my cousin Sherman. Sherm, say hello to the Ghostbusters. I promised him a ride in the car if he got you out.
Hi, it's really great to meet you guys. I know this sounds weird but once I had a dream that my grandfather was standing at the foot of my bed, but I knew it was impossible because he died and he started to tell me that --
Hey! Wait! Okay, I'll meet you there.
I thought you were like the fifth Ghostbuster.
I thought you were like the fifth Ghostbuster.
I let them handle all the little stuff. I just come in on the big ones.
Hi, welcome back to the 'World of the Psychic,' I'm Peter Venkman and I'm chatting with my guest, author, lecturer and of course, psychic, Milton Anglund. Milt, your new book is called The End of the World. Isn't that kind of like writing about gum disease. Yes, it could happen, but do you think anybody wants to read a book about it?
Well, I think it's important for people to know that the world is in danger.
Well, I think it's important for people to know that the world is in danger.
Okay, so can you tell us when it's going to happen or do we have to buy the book?
Okay, so can you tell us when it's going to happen or do we have to buy the book?
I predict that the world will end at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve.
I predict that the world will end at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve.
This year? That's cutting it a little close, isn't it? I mean, just from a sales point of view, the book just came out, right? So you're not even looking at the paperback release for maybe a year. And it's going to be at least another year after that if the thing has movie-of-the-week or mini-series potential. You would have been better off predicting

This is not just some money-making scheme! I didn't just make up the date. I have a strong psychic belief that the world will end on New Year's Eve.
This is not just some money-making scheme! I didn't just make up the date. I have a strong psychic belief that the world will end on New Year's Eve.
Well, for your sake, I hope you're right. But I think my other guest may disagree with you. Elaine, you had another date in mind?
Yes, I did. We were city champs.
Objection. Irrelevant and immaterial.
So, Dr. Venkman, please explain to the court why it is you and your co-defendants took it upon yourselves to dig a big hole in the middle of the street.
Seventy-seventh and First Avenue has so many holes already we didn't think anyone would notice.
I'll ask you again, Dr. Venkman. Why were you digging the hole? And please remember that you're under oath.
I had my fingers crossed when they swore me in, but I'm going to tell you the truth. There are things in this world that go way beyond human understanding, things that can't be explained and that most people don't want to know about anyway. That's where we come in.

So what are you saying? That the world of the supernatural is your special province?
So what are you saying? That the world of the supernatural is your special province?
No, I guess I'm just saying that shit happens and somebody has to deal with it.
Egon!
Hello, Venkman.
Hello, Venkman.
How've you been? How's teaching? I bet those science chicks really dig that big cranium of yours, huh?

I think they're more interested in my epididymis.
I think they're more interested in my epididymis.
I don't even want to know where that is.
I'd like to have a stool specimen
Yeah, you would. Is that for personal or professional reasons?
What now, Brainiac?
I think we should see if we can find anything abnormal on the street.
I think we should see if we can find anything abnormal on the street.
Finding something abnormal on the street shouldn't be too hard.
That's a thousand million electron volts.
I knew that.
You were supposed to help me with this.
You need the exercise.
"Vigo the Carpathian, born 1505, died 1610 --"
A hundred and five years? He really hung on, didn't he.
That's it? "I'll be back?"
It's a rough translation from the Moldavian.
You know, animals and lower life forms often anticipate major disasters. Given the new magnetheric readings we could see a tremendous breeding surge in the cockroach population.
Roach breeding? Sounds better and better. Dana? The boys are going down under the sewers tonight to look for slime. Egon thinks there might even be some kind of big roach-breeding surge. Should we forget about dinner and go with them instead?
Boys, listen. You're scaring the straights. Let's save this until tomorrow, okay?
This won't wait until tomorrow, Venkman. It's hot and it's ready to pop.
It's working. The positive GeV's are climbing.
They love you, Lib. Keep it up.
So far so good.
I'm worried. The vibrations could shake her to pieces. We should have padded her feet.
Pretty impressive, huh?
It's probably the first thing my grandparents saw when they came to this country.

Ostrov? I've been there. Good party town.
Who was that?
Some crank. Looking for goat hooves. Come up with anything?

This one's interesting. Berlin, 1939, a flower cart took off by itself and rolled approximately half a kilometer over level ground. Three hundred eyewitnesses.

You might want to check those Duke University mean averaging studies on controlled psychokinesis.

Good idea.
Nothing. Not a trace.
Why don't we try the Giga-meter?
The New York Pneumatic Railway. It was an experimental subway system. Fan-forced air-trains, built around 1870.
This is about as deep as you can go under Manhattan without digging your own hole.
This is about as deep as you can go under Manhattan without digging your own hole.
What's the reading?
Seems like a pretty open-minded guy, huh?
His nickname is "The Hammer."
Hey, I didn't imagine it. There must have been ten thousand gallons of it down there.
It may be ebbing and flowing from some tidal source.
I'm Egon --
And we're the ...
No, not exactly a man of the people. "Also known as Vigo the Cruel, Vigo the Torturer, Vigo the Despised, and Vigo the Unholy."
This guy was a bad monkey. He dabbled in all the Black Arts, and listen to this prophecy. Just before his head died, his last words were, "Death is but a door, time is but a window. I'll be back."
Six feet -- seven -- eight --
That's it. It's on the bottom.
That's it. It's on the bottom.
Nine feet -- ten --
If you two are looking for a fight, you got one. Who wants it first? Come on, Ray. Try me, sucker.
Butt out, you pencil-necked geek. I've had it with you.
It won't work. There's no way we could generate enough positive energy to crack that shell.
I can't believe things have gotten so bad in this city that there's no way back. Sure, it's crowded, it's dirty, it's noisy. And there are too many people who'd just as soon step on your face as look at you. But there've got to be a few sparks of sweet humanity left in this burned-out burg. We just have to mobilize it.

We need something that everyone can get behind, a symbol --
Something that appeals to the best in each and every one of us --
Something good --
Don't shoot! You'll hit Ray!
Do it! Just do it!
We've found it at every event site we've been to lately.
You mean this stuff actually feeds on 'bad vibes'?
There's definitely something going on in that studio. The PKE levels were max-plus and the Giga-meter was showing all red.
I'd put my money on that Vigo character.
Is the line sinking?
No, the slime is rising.
Rivers of the stuff!
And it's all flowing toward the museum.
Late Renaissance, I think. Caravaggio or Brunelleschi.
There's something very familiar about this painting.
Oh, hello, perhaps you could help me. I'm looking for an aerosol love potion I could spray on a certain Penthouse Pet that would make her unconditionally submit to an unusual personal request.
Oh, hiya, Pete.
Oh, hiya, Pete.
So, no goat hooves, huh?
So, no goat hooves, huh?
I knew that voice sounded familiar. What's up? How's it going?
I knew that voice sounded familiar. What's up? How's it going?
Nowhere -- fast. Why don't you lock up and buy me a sub?
Nowhere -- fast. Why don't you lock up and buy me a sub?
Uh, I can't. I'm kind of working on something.
Great. So what are you guys working on?
Oh, just checking something for an old friend.
Oh, just checking something for an old friend.
Who?
Who?
Who? Just -- someone we know.
Who? Just -- someone we know.
Oh, Ray --
Who? Who? Who?
Aaah! Nobody! I can't tell you!
Aaah! Nobody! I can't tell you!
Who, Ray?
Who, Ray?
Dana! Dana Barrett!
Well, Holmes, what do you think?
It's an interesting one, Pete. If anything was going on it's totally subdued now.
What's that?
Egon and I have been working on a gauge to measure psychomagnetheric energy in GEVs - giga electron volts.
I love this. We're onto something really big. I can smell it, Ray. We're going to make some headlines with this one.
Hey, hey, hey, stresshound! Are you nuts? If anybody found out about this we'd be in serious trouble. The judge couldn't have been clearer - no ghostbusting.
Hey, hey, hey, stresshound! Are you nuts? If anybody found out about this we'd be in serious trouble. The judge couldn't have been clearer - no ghostbusting.
Relax. We're going to keep this whole thing nice and quiet, low key, no profile.
Geez, I forgot how heavy these things are.
Okay, let's heat 'em up!
I'm Ray --
I'm Peter --
Careful, Winston. He's a mean one. And to celebrate our grand reopening, we're giving you twice the value with our special half-price 'Welcome Back' service plan.
Hold on, Ray! Half-price! Have you gone crazy?
Hold on, Ray! Half-price! Have you gone crazy?
I guess so, Pete, because that's not all. Tell them what else we've got, Egon.
You know he ran that last lap in under six minutes?
If he wasn't dead he'd be an Olympic prospect.
Oh good, you're here. Spengler and I have something really amazing to show you.
It's not that thing you do with your nostrils, is it?
And now you're going to eat it?
No, I'm just restoring it to its normal state.
This is what you do with your spare time?
This is an incredible breakthrough, Venkman. A psychoreactive substance! Whatever this is, it clearly responds to human emotional states.

'Mood slime.' We ought to bottle this stuff and sell it.
Like a goat on garbage.
We're running tests to see if we can get an equally strong positive reaction.

What kind of tests?

Well, we sing to it, we talk to it, we say supportive, nurturing things --
Well, we sing to it, we talk to it, we say supportive, nurturing things --
You're not sleeping with this stuff, are you?
Did you find anything at Dana's?
Nothing. Just some mood-slime residue in and around the bathtub. But we did turn up some interesting stuff on this Vigo character you mentioned. I found the name Vigo the Carpathian in Leon Zundinger's Magicians, Martyrs and Madmen. Listen to this:
Beautiful, beautiful. Work with me, baby. Just have fun with it. Okay, he's playing it cool. Let's finish up and get out of here.
I'll get one more reading.
What happened?
You just picked up three penalty points on your driver's license.
Don't tell me, let me guess. All-you-can-eat barbecue rib night at the Sizzler?
We're going down into the sewer system to see if we can trace the source of the psycho-reactive slime flow. We thought you might want to come along.

Darn it! I wish I'd known you were going. I'm stuck with these damn dinner reservations.
I think we're going to have to pass on the sewer trip, boys. Let me know what you find out.
Okay, but you're missing all the fun.
You should've been there, Venkman. Absolutely incredible!
Yeah, sorry I missed it. I guess you guys didn't know about the dress code here. It's really kind of a coat and tie place.
Yeah, sorry I missed it. I guess you guys didn't know about the dress code here. It's really kind of a coat and tie place.
It's all over the city, Pete -- well, under it actually.
It looks like a giant Jello mold.
I hate Jello.
Forget it. The Vienna Boys Choir couldn't get through this stuff.
Good effort. Now what? Should we say supportive, nurturing things to it, Ray?
I hope we have enough stuff to do the job.
Only one way to find out. Ready, Teddy?
I'll keep to the middle of the channel. We're okay to 59th Street, then we'll go ashore and take First Avenue to 79th.
Are you kidding? We'll hit all that bridge traffic at 59th. I'm going to take 72nd straight up to Fifth. Trust me, I used to drive a cab.
I don't think they make Nikes in her size.
We're almost there, Lib. Step on it.
My Fault!
She's new in town.
Vigi, Vigi, Vigi -- you have been a bad little monkey.
The whole city's together on this one. We took a vote. Everybody's down on you, you know.
I think she looks pretty good here, don't you?
Yeah, and a lot easier to get to than that island.
My great-grandparents were Swiss. I still have the pictures they took of the statue from the boat when they arrived.
Oh, right, you told me that. They came to America seeking other kinds of cheese, as I recall. How about you, Winston?
What's your story, Pete?
Me? I'm a little of everything. Some Irish, some German, some French, Dutch -- the women in my family slept around. And that's what made this country great.
Ready?
I'm ready.
I'm ready.
Then let's do it.
That's it, Ray. I've had it. No more parties. I'm tired of taking abuse from over-privileged nine-year-olds.
Come on, Winston. We can't quit now. The holidays are coming up. It's our best season.
Give it up, Ray. You're living in the past. Ghostbusters doesn't exist anymore. In a year these kids won't even remember who we are.
Ungrateful little Yuppie larvae. After all we did for this city.
Ungrateful little Yuppie larvae. After all we did for this city.
Yeah, what did we do, Ray? The last real job we had we bubbled up a hundred foot marshmallow man and blew the top three floors off an uptown highrise.
Yeah, what did we do, Ray? The last real job we had we bubbled up a hundred foot marshmallow man and blew the top three floors off an uptown highrise.
Yeah, but what a ride. You can't make a hamburger without chopping up a cow.
Does it have any favorites?
It likes all the sappy stuff: 'Cumbaya,' 'Everything is Beautiful,' 'It's a Small World' -- but it loves Jackie Wilson.
And he didn't die of old age either. He was poisoned, stabbed, shot, hung, stretched, disemboweled, drawn and quartered.
I guess he wasn't too popular at the end there.
You got a flux and a half.
Now if you don't want to be the -- -- fifth person ever to die in meta-shock from a planar rift, I suggest you get down behind that desk and don't move until we give you the signal "Stabilize -- All Clear."
Now that's one ugly dude.
Huh? What?
Huh? What?
You finished here?
You finished here?
What? Yeah.
What? Yeah.
Are you all right? You coming down with something?
Are you all right? You coming down with something?
No, I'm fine. I just got light-headed for a second there. Let's go.
Are you telling me how to drive?
No, I just thought --
No, I just thought --
Well don't think!
Are you all right?
Yeah, I guess so. It was the strangest thing. I knew what I was doing but I couldn't stop. This really terrible feeling came over me and -- I don't know -- I just felt like driving into that tree and ending it all. Whew! Sorry, boys.
Nice going, Ray! What were you trying to do -- drown me?
Look, Zeddemore, it wasn't my fault you were too stupid to drop that line.
Look, Zeddemore, it wasn't my fault you were too stupid to drop that line.
You better watch your mouth, man, or I'll punch your lights out.
You better watch your mouth, man, or I'll punch your lights out.
Oh yeah? Anytime, anytime. Just go ahead and try it.
What are we doing? Ray, I was ready to kill you.
Don't you see? It's the slime. That stuff is like pure, concentrated evil.
She's moving!
I've lived in New York all my life and I never visited the Statue of Liberty. Now I finally get here and we're taking her out for a walk.
Ray -- Ray -- How do you feel, man?
Groovy. I've never felt better in my life.
I don't care what you say. This could be a major Christmas gift item.
Right, and the first time someone gets mad, their toaster will eat their hand.
Right, and the first time someone gets mad, their toaster will eat their hand.
So we'll put a warning on the label.
Tell him about the toaster.
I don't think he's ready for the toaster.
It better not start yet. I'm trying to finish my potholder before lunch.
You think all those predictions about the world coming to an end in the 1990s are true?
And pure --
And decent.
Kind of makes you wonder, doesn't it?
Wonder what?
Wonder what?
If she's naked under that toga. She's French, you know.
How deep does it get? That water's cold and I can't swim.
It's okay. I have my Senior Lifesaving card.
My people weren't taking any pictures from those slave ships, man. And there wasn't any Statue in Charleston Harbor to welcome them, either. What are you, Dana?
Miss Blue Blood? Her family's been here since the year 12.
Aren't you glad we waited?
I don't know. It probably would've been the same.
I don't know. It probably would've been the same.
Well, thanks a lot.
Roy? Your clock broke.
Nice going, honey. It was brand new.
Nice going, honey. It was brand new.
I didn't break your precious clock, Roy!
Now where are you going?
To the bathroom, where do you think?
To the bathroom, where do you think?
Have I done the right thing?
Hey, sweetheart, will you CUT THAT OUT!!!
Uuuuuuugh!!
Uuuuuuugh!!
What's the matter, dear?
Is it a star?
It is a star! That's great. You're very good.
Ready? What is it?
Ummm -- figure eight?
Ummm -- figure eight?
Incredible! Five for five. You're not cheating on me here, are you?
Incredible! Five for five. You're not cheating on me here, are you?
No. They're just coming to me.
No. They're just coming to me.
Well, you're doing great. Keep it up.
Well, I guess some people have it and some don't.
Do you think I have it, Dr. Venkman?
Do you think I have it, Dr. Venkman?
Definitely. I think you may be a very gifted telepath.
Okay. Just give me a second here. I have to leave now but if you've got some time I'd like you to come back this evening and do some more work with me.
Eight o'clock?
Eight o'clock?
I was just going to say "eight." You're fantastic!
Oh, Dana, it's you ...
Hi, Louis.
Hi, Louis.
... I thought it was the drug store.
... I thought it was the drug store.
Are you sick, Louis?
Oh, no, I feel great. I just ordered some more vitamins. I see you were exercising. So was I. I taped "20 Minute Workout" and played it back at high speed so it only took ten minutes and I got a really good workout. You wanna have a mineral water with me?
No thanks, Louis. I'm really tired. I've been rehearsing all morning.
No thanks, Louis. I'm really tired. I've been rehearsing all morning.
Okay. I'll take a raincheck. I always have plenty of mineral water and other nutritious health foods, but you know that. Listen, that reminds me, I'm having a party for all my clients. It's gonna be my fourth anniversary as an accountant. I know you fill out your own tax return, but I'd like you to come being that you're my next door neighbor

Oh, that's nice, Louis. I'll stop by if I'm around.
Oh, that's nice, Louis. I'll stop by if I'm around.
You know you shouldn't leave your TV on so loud when you go out. That creep down the hall phoned the manager.
You know you shouldn't leave your TV on so loud when you go out. That creep down the hall phoned the manager.
I thought I turned it off. I guess I forgot.
Oh, Dana, it's you.
Hi, Louis.
Hi, Louis.
Hey, it's crazy in here. You're missing a classic party.
Hey, it's crazy in here. You're missing a classic party.
Well, actually Louis I have a friend coming by.
Well, actually Louis I have a friend coming by.
Great! Bring her, too. But you better hurry. I made nachos with non-fat cheese and they're almost gone. I'll make some more though.
Great! Bring her, too. But you better hurry. I made nachos with non-fat cheese and they're almost gone. I'll make some more though.
Fine, Louis. We'll stop in for a drink.
Fine, Louis. We'll stop in for a drink.
I got the Twister game for later ...
Are you the Gatekeeper?
I am Zuul.
Oh, sure. I'm getting used to this.
I'm innocent! Honest, Dana. I never touched you. Not that I remember anyway.
I'm innocent! Honest, Dana. I never touched you. Not that I remember anyway.
All right, what happened to me?
Hello. I'm Peter Venkman. May I help you?
Yes ... well ... I'm not sure. What I have to say may sound a little ... unusual.
Yes ... well ... I'm not sure. What I have to say may sound a little ... unusual.
We're all professionals here, Miss ...
We're all professionals here, Miss ...
Barrett. Dana Barrett.
... and then I opened the door again but it was gone. There was nothing there.
So what do you think it was?
Why would anyone make up a thing like that?
Some people like the attention. Some people are just crazy.
Is that your professional opinion?
It's in the stars.
No, just that one word -- Zuul -- but I have no idea what it means.
Spengler, see if you can find the word "Zuul" in any of the literature. I'll take Miss Barrett home and check out her apartment.
Have you ever thought of moving out -- at least until this disturbance blows over?
No. If I moved out now I'd be acknowledging that what happened was real. I'm not ready to do that.
You play the cello! It's my favorite instrument.
Really? Do you have a favorite piece?
Really? Do you have a favorite piece?
I'd have to say Prokofiev's third concerto.

That's a violin concerto.

Yeah, but it's got a great cello break.
You really don't act like a scientist.
No? What do I act like?
No? What do I act like?
Like a used car salesman.
Like a used car salesman.
Thanks. What's in there?
That's too bad.
What?
What?
Nothing. Is that the kitchen?
Uh-huh.
Well, let's check it out.
Well, let's check it out.
I'll wait here if you don't mind.
You're quite a housekeeper.
I told you, I ...
I told you, I ...
I know. It happened by itself.
Damn!
Are you all right?
Are you all right?
Yeah, yeah.
There's nothing there now and I don't get any significant readings.
This is terrible. Either there's a monster in my kitchen or I'm completely crazy.

I've got to go now.
Hey, Dana. What is it? What happened?
I am Zuul. I am the Gatekeeper.
We must prepare for the coming of Gozer.
Okay, I'll help you. Should we make some dip or something?

Really? Can't wait to meet him. As long as we're waiting for him, I'd really like to try something with you -- in the bedroom.
Do you want this body?
Well, I'll just use it for a while and get it right back to you.

I want you inside me.

Whoa!! Nice voice.
Nothing! We just got rid of that thing in your kitchen.
Really! Is it gone?

Yeah, along with most of your furniture and a lot of your personal possessions. This one took some work.
Yeah, along with most of your furniture and a lot of your personal possessions. This one took some work.
Thank you. Next time I want to break a lease I'll know who to call.
This is going to cost you, you know. Our fees are ridiculously high.
Talk to my accountant.
I trust you're moving us to a better space somewhere on campus.
No, we're moving you OFF CAMPUS. The Board of Regents has decided to terminate your grant. You are to vacate these premises immediately.

Dr. Venkman, we believe that the purpose of science is to serve mankind. You, however, seem to regard science as some kind of "dodge" or "hustle." Your theories are the worst kind of popular tripe, your methods are sloppy and your conclusions are highly questionable. You're a poor scientist, Dr. Venkman, and you have no place in this department or in this University.

Yeah, it's some kind of mallow-type substance - that's for sure.

One thing at a time. We don't even know what it is yet.
What's that got to do with it?
Back off, man! I'm a scientist!
Did you see it? What was it?
We'll get back to you.
You're very handy, I can tell. I bet you like to read a lot, too.
Print is dead.
Print is dead.
That's very fascinating to me. I read a lot myself. Some people think I'm too intellectual. But I think reading is a fabulous way to spend your spare time. I also play racketball. Do you ever play?

Egon, there's something very strange about that man. I'm very psychic usually and right now I have this terrible feeling that something awful is going to happen to you. I'm afraid you're going to die.
Die in what sense?

In the physical sense.

I don't care. I see us as tiny parts of a vast organism, like two bacteria living on a rotting speck of dust floating in an infinite void.

Why don't you step into the office and we'll talk about it. Hold all my calls, Janine.
What calls?
Here's the paper on the Brooklyn job. She paid with a Visa card.
Here are tonight's calls.
And someone from the EPA is here to see you.
The EPA? What's he want?

Has this ever happened before?

Well, because I'm curious. I want to know more about what you do here.

Hey! Make yourself useful! Go save a tree!
At ease, Officers. I'm Peter Venkman. I think there's been some kind of misunderstanding here and I want to cooperate in every way I can.
Forget it, Venkman. You had your chance to cooperate but you thought it was more fun to insult me. Now it's my turn, smart-ass.
You turned off the power! Look, there was another man here ... You have to find him and bring him back. A short determined-looking guy with the eyes of a happy zombie.
See! They are using drugs.
The man is a psychopath, Your Honor.
Probably a mixture of gases, no doubt stolen from the Army ...
Mr. Mayor, it's a pretty simple choice. You can believe Mr. Pecker here ...
That's "Peck!"
That's "Peck!"
... or you can accept the fact that this city is heading for a disaster of really Biblical proportions.
All right. What is it?
A square?

Good guess -- but no.

Yes. I don't like this.

Well, just 75 more to go. What's this one?

You volunteered, didn't you? Aren't we paying you for this?

Yeah, but I didn't know you were going to give me electric shocks. What are you trying to prove?

Hey, Mister! Can I see those guns?
They're not guns. They're particle throwers.
They're not guns. They're particle throwers.
Yeah, yeah. I just want to see 'em.
Yeah, yeah. I just want to see 'em.
I couldn't do that. You might hurt someone.
Wait! Wait! Let me ask you something. If you like shot Superman with those guns, would he feel it or what?
On Earth -- no. But on Krypton we could slice him up like Oscar Mayer Bologna.

When you were in the bathroom, did you notice anything that was yellow and unusually smelly?
Oh! You're here.
What have you got, Egon?
What have you got, Egon?
Oh, this is big, Peter. This is very big. There's definitely something here.
Oh, this is big, Peter. This is very big. There's definitely something here.
Egon, somehow this reminds me of the time you tried to drill a hole in your head. Do you remember that?
Spengler, are you serious about actually catching a ghost?
I'm always serious.
I'm always serious.
Wow!
Just for your information, Ray, the interest payments alone for the first five years come to over $75,000.
Will you guys relax? We are on the threshold of establishing the indispensable defense science of the next decade - Professional Paranormal Investigations and Eliminations. The franchise rights alone will make us wealthy beyond your wildest dreams.
Generally, you don't see that kind of behavior in a major appliance. What do you think, Egon?
She's telling the truth -- or at least she thinks she is.
Did you see anything?
Didn't see anything, Didn't get anything. Nice girl - no ghost. I'm starting to worry. You said your graph was pointing to something big. You told me things were going to start popping.
Something was definitely here.
Yeah, I can smell it.
Wait! Wait! There's something I forgot to tell you.
What?
What?
Don't cross the beams.
Don't cross the beams.
Why not?
Why not?
Trust me. It will be bad.
Trust me. It will be bad.
What do you mean "bad?"
What do you mean "bad?"
It's hard to explain, but try to imagine all life as you know it stopping instantaneously and finding yourself confined forever in another dimension.
It's Peter, Egon. I've got a problem.
What is it?
What is it?
I'm with Dana Barrett and she's floating three feet off the bed.
I'm with Dana Barrett and she's floating three feet off the bed.
Does she want to be?
Does she want to be?
I don't think so. It's more of that Gozer thing. She says she's the Gatekeeper. Does that make any sense to you?
I don't think so. It's more of that Gozer thing. She says she's the Gatekeeper. Does that make any sense to you?
Some. I just met the Keymaster. He's here with me now. Venkman? Are you there?
Some. I just met the Keymaster. He's here with me now. Venkman? Are you there?
Yeah, yeah. I was just thinking. It probably wouldn't be a good idea for them to get together at this point.
Yeah, yeah. I was just thinking. It probably wouldn't be a good idea for them to get together at this point.
I agree.
I agree.
You have to keep him there. Do whatever you have to, but don't let him leave, He could be very dangerous.
All right. I'll try.
I'll spend the night here and get back first thing in the morning.
I'll spend the night here and get back first thing in the morning.
All right, Peter. Good night.
He wants to shut down the storage grid.
If you turn that thing off we won't be responsible for the consequences.
Where's the Keymaster?
Oh, shit!
Of course! Ivo Shandor, I saw his name in Tobin's SPIRIT GUIDE. He started a secret society in 1920.
Let me guess -- Gozer Worshippers.
Let me guess -- Gozer Worshippers.
Yes. After the First World War Shandor decided that society was too sick to survive. And he wasn't alone. He had close to a thousand followers when he died. They conducted rituals, bizarre rituals, intended to bring about the end of the world.

She said he was "the Destructor."
She said he was "the Destructor."
Who?
Who?
Gozer.
Gozer.
You talked to Gozer?
You talked to Gozer?
Get a grip on yourself, Egon. I talked to Dana Barrett and she referred to Gozer as the Destructor.
What now?
Full-stream with strogon pulse.
On the count of three! One ... Two ...
No! Them! Shoot them! Cross the beams.
No! You said crossing the beams would be BAD. It'll kill her! And us!
Life is just a state of mind.
Life is just a state of mind.
But it's my favorite state.
You know, Peter, this could be a past life experience intruding on the present.
Or even a race memory, stored in the collective unconscious. And I wouldn't rule out clairvoyance or telepathic contact either.
I just realized something. We've never had a completely successful test with any of the equipment.
I blame myself.
Sorry, Buddy!
We'd better adjust our streams.
Ray! Where are you? Are you all right?
God, it's ugly!
It's working!
Easy ... Easy ... I'm going to throw in my trap now.
Set entry grid.
Neutronize. System shut.
I've got to sleep.
I need two new purge valves. How's the grid around the storage facility holding up?
I need two new purge valves. How's the grid around the storage facility holding up?
I'm worried, Ray. It's getting crowded in there. And all my recent data points to something big on the bottom.
What happened??!!!?
The storage facility blew. This one ... ... shut off the protection grid.
Look at the structure of the roof cap. It looks exactly like the kind of telemetry tracker NASA uses to identify dead pulsars in other galaxies.
And look at this, Peter Cold-riveted girders with selenium cores.
You mean if I stand here and concentrate on the image of Roberto Clemente, Gozer will appear as Roberto Clemente and wipe us out?
That appears to be the case.
Excuse me for a minute. Ray, I'm right in the middle of something here. Can you come back in about an hour?
Peter, at 1:40 this afternoon at the main branch of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue, ten people witnessed a free-roaming, vaporous, full-torso apparition. It blew books from shelves at twenty feet away. Scared the socks off some poor librarian.

Sure. That's great, Ray. I think you should get down there right away and check it out. Let me know what happens.
Sure. That's great, Ray. I think you should get down there right away and check it out. Let me know what happens.
No, this one's for real, Peter. Spengler went down there and took some PKE readings. Right off the top of the scale. Buried the needle. We're close this time. I can feel it.
Spengler and I have charted every psychic occurrence in the Tri-State area for the past two years. The graph we came up with definitely points to something big.
Ray, as your friend I have to tell you I think you've really gone around the bend on this ghost stuff. You've been running your ass off for two years checking out every schizo in the Five Boroughs who thinks he's had an experience. And what have you seen?

What do you mean by "seen?"
Looked at with your eyes.
Looked at with your eyes.
Well, I was at an unexplained multiple high-altitude rockfall once.
Well, I was at an unexplained multiple high-altitude rockfall once.
Uh-huh. I've heard about the rockfall, Ray. I think you've been spending too much time with Spengler.
What is it?
It looks like a big pair of breasts and a pot belly.
I told you it's real.
What do we do now?
What do we do now?
I don't know. Talk to it.
I don't know. Talk to it.
What do I say?
What do I say?
Anything! Just make contact.
Anything! Just make contact.
Hey, Lady? Lady! Can you talk? Who are you? This is not working. Think of something else.
Hey, Lady? Lady! Can you talk? Who are you? This is not working. Think of something else.
Okay. Okay. I got it. I know what to do. Stay close. I have a plan.
"Get her?" That was your whole plan? You call that science?
I guess I got a little overexcited. Wasn't it incredible! I'm telling you, this is a first. You know what this could mean to the University?
I guess I got a little overexcited. Wasn't it incredible! I'm telling you, this is a first. You know what this could mean to the University?
Oh, yeah. This could be bigger than the microchip. They'll probably throw out the entire engineering department and turn their building over to us. We're probably the first serious scientists to ever molest a dead old lady.
If you guys are right, if we can actually trap a ghost and hold it somehow, I think I could win the Nobel Prize.
If anyone deserves it, it's Spengler and me. We're doing all the hard research and designing the equipment.
If anyone deserves it, it's Spengler and me. We're doing all the hard research and designing the equipment.
Yeah, but I introduced you guys. You never would've met if not for me. That's got to be worth something.
You said you floored 'em at the Regents' meeting.
Ray, I apologize. I guess my confidence in the Regents was misplaced. They did this to Galileo, too.
This is like a major disgrace. Forget M.I.T. or Stanford now ... they wouldn't touch us with a three-meter cattle prod.
You're always so worried about your reputation. We don't need the University. Einstein did his best stuff while he was working as a patent clerk.'They can't stop progress.

Do you know what a patent clerk makes? I liked the University. They gave us money, they gave us the facilities and we didn't have to produce anything! I've worked in the private sector. They expect results. You've never been out of college. You don't know what it's like out there.

Let me tell you, Ray, everything in life happens for a reason. Call it fate, call it luck, Karma, whatever. I think we were destined to get kicked out of there.

Maybe. But no one ever advertised before.
Wow! Does this pole still work?
This might do ... I don't know ... it just seems kind of "pricey" for a fixer-upper, don't you think? We're trying to keep our costs down. You know how it is when you're starting a new company.
Everybody can relax. I found the car. How do you like it?
Do you think it's wide enough? How much?

Why don't I check out the building? It may have a history of psychic turbulence.
Good idea. Were any other words spoken that you remember?
How was your date?
It wasn't a date. It was an investigation.
They will.
Do you know when that might be? We're on the brink of a very serious cash-flow problem.
So do I.
No sense worrying about it now.

Boy, that was a rough one.
I can't take much more of this. The pace is killing me.
Egon, how's the grid around the storage facility holding up?
It's not good, Pete.
I guess they don't build them like they used to, huh?
No! Nobody ever built them like this! The architect was either an authentic whacko or a certified genius. The whole building is like a huge antenna for pulling in and concentrating psychokinetic energy.

Yeah, I heard that. Now tell me what you really do.
Hey man. What is it you're so involved with there?

You don't have to worry about that with us, sir.
Right. We'll believe anything.
Stantz? You okay in there?
LATER, MAN!!
What's he talking about? Choose what?
What do you mean "choose?" We don't understand.
Where are we now, Commodus? Can you see the camp? My Gods! The air is turning into ice!
We're nearly there, Lucilla.

More wine, sister? Surely you can drink more than that.
I was suddenly thinking about going to bed.
I was suddenly thinking about going to bed.
Oh, stay... Don't you want to join the chorus of praises for Narcissus' glory? Just remember, he is a married man.
Quite so. Narcissus and his courageous men; may they live long to serve Rome...
And Caesar! Let's not forget to serve Caesar!
Don't you think you should at least wave?
Why? Then they'll notice when I'm gone. Well. I'm making a public appearance aren't I?
They hate me, they really hate me don't they?
Maybe you should get married. Pick one of your cousins, it would demonstrate a profound stability.
I should at least have you, don't you think?
If you get me pregnant with a boy he'll be a double direct heir and will end up killing you for the throne.
Did Narcissus die today? Wasn't this his day to die?
I'm sure, I don't know.
No one in Rome has ever heard of him. Do you want to remind those few in the Senate who have? The whole sordid thing is far beneath your position to begin with. Forget about him.
Let some time pass... then ask, quietly, without anyone knowing it comes from me.
Those are priceless sculptures.
I want every single thing that belonged to my father out of this house! If it's worth something then sell it!
It's disgusting! Animals! I had to come here under armed guard. Slaves -- get this junk out of my sight.
Commodus is heaving out every thing that belonged to our father. Except that he can't heave out his ghost.
How about in the forum. Right in front of the Senate.
If I may be so bold...
If I may be so bold...
For the gods, spit it out!
For the gods, spit it out!
Why not do it in the Colosseum?
Kill him! Tribuus -- execute that bastard.
You can't do that! You came here to turn the crowd around not make them hate you.
Tribuus... tomorrow.
You're coming back?
You're coming back?
I have to come back. If I don't come back the people will think I'm a coward. Tribuus, tomorrow he dies -- I want his blood on the sand. Do you understand?
Where have you been?
Taking my pleasure. Do I need to clear my lovers with you?
Taking my pleasure. Do I need to clear my lovers with you?

What is that... wailing?
What is that... wailing?
The fans of Narcissus. They were on vigil outside the school of Proximo. They believe he's dying.
Now that is a happy sound! Tomorrow, I want the citizens -- my people -- back in the arena. The Gods know, I'm tired. Come to bed, now; tonight we're celebrating.
What are you talking about?

Now that we're done with that infatuation forever.

Yes? Go on!
Yes? Go on!
"... by the emperor of Rome. This writer asks: between a Senate that debates truth until they choke, an Emperor who has the birth sign of a woman, is it possible there is more virtue within the arena than without?"

Do you want posters, too?
Damn him! I should have killed him on the front -- I let you talk me out of that.
You would have had a full scale revolt on your hands.

What have I got now? It's exactly as if there were two emperors. Because of this the people have two minds. He is their champion.
Welcome back from your great triumph Narcissus Meridas. My father sends his heart felt praise. Sadly, Marcus is in dark humors -- nothing to worry about, but he needs rest. Likely just the weather.
Respectfully Caesar, Quintus and I must report.
Respectfully Caesar, Quintus and I must report.
Of course, but not now. However, if he continues to be unwell, you may report to me.
Do you expect Marcus to be well enough by morning for an audience?
That's difficult to say, general.
That's difficult to say, general.
Perhaps, Master Galen, you may say.
Then you'd be out of a job.
Gladly Caesar.
Gladly Caesar.
Or perhaps into a new one. But here's to your God and the courage of our legions...
I back Rome against all her enemies -- if that answer disappoints you, I'm not a politician...
Oh, but with the army behind you, you could become extremely political. Not a Republican by any chance?
I would say there's nothing more dangerous than a man who knows what 'right' is.
The dangerous man, Caesar, is the man who doesn't care.
But they're not destroyed, not yet.
Do we really need to repair this fort? It seems like an expensive undertaking. I propose we burn it to the ground. That way if the Germans cross the Danube here there will be nothing to help them build an offensive position.
You and my father have become very close. Perhaps one day I may say the same for us.
You flatter me, Caesar.
You flatter me, Caesar.
Being as close, I'm certain you've noticed what we all have noticed.
Being as close, I'm certain you've noticed what we all have noticed.
Caesar?
Caesar?
That this illness has clouded his mind.
I'm ordering a general stand-down in preparation for withdrawal back across the Danube.
We have to stop the Germans now!
Forgive me, Caesar, but do two Senator represent the mood of the whole Senate or the will of the Roman people? Besides, every truce we make with the Germans they break!
They won't break this one.
They won't break this one.
Apparently my opinion wasn't needed.
Where is my family?
Cooperate and they will be returned to your estate. I could have executed you.
Cooperate and they will be returned to your estate. I could have executed you.
And my army would have thrown your body into the Danube.
The army is a problem. They love you. You have led them from victory to victory in the name of Rome and they love you. And after all, you're just a hothead acting from a misguided sense of loyalty -- who could fault you for that? Thus have I reached a compromise with the Senate over your fate: instead of executing you, I'm sending
On what charge?
Endorse me in public. Do that and I'll make you rich and set you free. I'll return your estates. I know you would give anything to be outside again. Endorse me and you will be free. Think of it. What would you do with your freedom?
If you set me free I will find my way back to the army, march on Rome and depose you. Then, the army and I will restore the Republic so that animals like you will never control human destinies again.
Insubordination. To the Emperor... and the Senate.
Quintus will tell the army that you are being called to Rome to celebrate your victory. They will hear that you are living in luxury. He will let them feel you have betrayed them for the good life. And soon the army won't even remember your name.
The Senate is out to sink you. I swear it, Caesar, your generosity is being repaid with public attacks on your honor. Your enemies want you weak enough so by the first of Janus when you must be confirmed the Senate will be able to deny you.
How can they? Who else is there? I have no heir...
Caesar, ignore them.
Ignore that?! The sooner we leave this disgusting place the better.
Ignore that?! The sooner we leave this disgusting place the better.
At least stay for the running of the animals. You are paying for it you know...
Gods of hell! This must cost a fortune! How many days is this going to go on?
Until your confirmation date.
And like children everywhere they scream "freedom" the most when they desire it least. I beg you, please continue, Caesar.
At the opening of the month of Janus, I will ask this noble body to confirm my emperorship...
Throw it down into the streets! Down into the Forum. If it's my father they want then give him to them!
Yes. You know, that's not a bad idea.
Yes. You know, that's not a bad idea.
Maybe it'll crush Gaius.
Maybe it'll crush Gaius.
I'm serious.
I'm serious.
So am I.
So am I.
We can crush Gaius another way. What if you do throw something to the people they really want? Make them a gift of food.

Give away food?

Sacks of grain, even bread. I own the grain licenses for the military, I can arrange to divert a shipment bound for the army of the Danube.

Make a gift to the people. It's your money anyway so it's only fair.
Caesar, let me sponsor your first wager in the arena.
I wouldn't know who to bet on.
Gladly, Caesar. And, if you'd like we can take you for a tour of the front at first light.
I'm certain father will be in better humors by then. Now, honor us with your presence at dinner. I'll join you as soon as I see my father's physician.
Marcus Aurelius has died.
He left us at dawn.
We must obey our emperor and the Senate.
I met with Falco, and the Senators have agreed to call for a truce with the Germans.
This is the only place in Rome where I thought -- I believed -- I was wholly in power.
Narcissus will never support you, Caesar, he has too much of a philosophical temperament.
It's because he comes off as the underdog.
Underdog! How can he be an underdog -- he wins all the time! I'm the emperor why can't I kill him? He could be poisoned, or somehow killed to look like an accident.
Underdog! How can he be an underdog -- he wins all the time! I'm the emperor why can't I kill him? He could be poisoned, or somehow killed to look like an accident.
You don't want to kill him. If anything happens to him now you will be blamed... and he knows it. Besides, that gladiator school is a fortress. It would take the army to break in there. What you want is to... offer him the wooden sword. If he takes it, he's no longer the champion of the people, is he? He's gone. And you
Where is my father?
Where is the emperor and the army, soldier?
Tribuus, what happened in the arena? Was Narcissus killed?
He must have been. He was on the list of prisoners to be executed.
Why isn't he dead? Damn you, you promised me he would be dead!
Caesar, I did my best. The Colosseum isn't under my control...
Yes, Caesar?
Jerses -- tomorrow...
Tribuus! Go left here, I want to see my new statue at Via Claudia.
Yes, Caesar.
Yes, Caesar.
We need more statues -- perhaps I should open medical clinics. For the poor. Citizens only, though...
You won an impossible fight. You got the attention of the crowd, legate...
This is Cos, this precocious young man. A scribe for the Daily Action. I've invited him to write a small piece about you...
This is Cos, this precocious young man. A scribe for the Daily Action. I've invited him to write a small piece about you...
I'm mentioning you in tomorrow's athlete's section, legate. So, I'd love to know your birth sign; it effects how people bet. And perhaps you could tell me a bit about... well, who are you?
"Caesar Commodus discovering his lineage converges with the Demigod, Hercules, has determined to display his magnificence before his beloved citizens." The Emperor's going to fight in the arena. I'm supposed to write this for tomorrow's edition.
Commodus... he's a gladiator... is he mad?
Cos, what in hades is the emperor up to? And don't tell me you don't know!
I don't know...
I don't know...
AGH! Please! He's having a secret device constructed for the circus. The brass craftsmen are working overtime.

I'll nose around...
I'll nose around...
You know there were riots last night. Now the unrest has started again and Commodus has sent for an army division. You understand what you are doing...
So tell me, what happened between you and the emperor? What really happened on the German front? You know the Senate's arguing your case...
That's their job, isn't it? To argue. So, I think my case will be long on talk and short on action.
That's their job, isn't it? To argue. So, I think my case will be long on talk and short on action.
I am prepared to write anything you tell me.
My birth sign is Water Bearer, twenty-fifth day in the month of Janus.
The exact month when the Emperor must be confirmed!
The Emperor and I are bound by the threads of The Fates. He was born on August thirty-first, you know.
That makes his birth sign... Virgo! Why that's the sign of a little girl! Can you tell my readers more about your star-crossed connection with Emperor Commodus?
That makes his birth sign... Virgo! Why that's the sign of a little girl! Can you tell my readers more about your star-crossed connection with Emperor Commodus?
Proximo, we need to talk about my one third... I imagine the betting booths will be doing good business. And, what was the name of that olive oil company?
It's time for you to tell the Citizens that Commodus stole the money allocated for defending the German border. It's time to tell the citizens everything. Will you write it?
Yes, because I know they'll read it.
The battle was won, today, and I prefer to believe it was a gift of Janus, the eldest God of Rome. God of my ancestors.
God of passages and changes?

My only visits to Rome, Senator, have been through books. But the war's over, time to close the door of war once and for all.
I would venture, with all respect: the Emperor's health is the business of every soul in the empire.
Yes! The days of Imperial Prerogative and disdain for the Senate are over -- thanks to your father! Now report to the Senate, Master Galen: what is Marcus' state?
A republican is a man who strives to create equality among all classes. At the core he's a man who believes in doing what's right.
The trouble is defining exactly what 'right' is.
The trouble is defining exactly what 'right' is.
We all know what right is, Senator.
The Senate too?
The moment you returned from the battle your options were clear. If you are a friend to neither side, legate, you must be an enemy to both. We needed to know what you believed.

Why you?

Fools to let us both live; we'll be our own best witnesses at our trial.

That's what worries me...
Is this Rome? Are we just going to be executed?
They can't... if this is Rome...
No future-telling, please, I've been terrified enough for one day.
Narcissus! Terrified? You? The only thing he's scared of is me.
You know our two most senior Senators: Gaius Cantus and Falco Verus?
Only from a distance.
I thought all good generals were quick to recognize opportunities.
Sneaking around with your brother?
Sneaking around with your brother?
Without him. He'd be weeping if he overheard that. Well? The idea of you as my adopted brother is very... exciting.

How do you know I am playing? Well, the clown is always harmless. Isn't that right? And how did you ever get to know me so well? The last we spent any time together I was fourteen. I think you know me better than my father. He's going to die, isn't he?

I don't believe that. He's got the best doctor in the world and a will of iron. You know we're preparing for a full-blown invasion of Germany.
I don't believe that. He's got the best doctor in the world and a will of iron. You know we're preparing for a full-blown invasion of Germany.
Of course I know -- who do you think is paying for it? The Emperor himself, didn't you know? Why do you think Commodus came rushing up to the front? Burning patriotism? Filial love? He wants to be sure when he takes over there's enough cash left in the treasury to... play Emperor. Watch out for him, Narcissus; he's inexperienced, but... be careful.
It's my brother's neck you want, not mine.
Yours will do!
I came here to see that you stay alive. The people need a living breathing alternative to Commodus, a hero.
You mean a symbol of someone who doesn't exist.
You mean a symbol of someone who doesn't exist.
But you do exist. Narcissus: hero of the battle of the Danube.
Twenty years I've led men to die. For me it was the glory of Rome. But that was something. If it wasn't that, then it was the pay or the loot of the next whore -- but that was something! These men here are butchered for laughs! Their lives are like jokes delivered in the back alley theaters where their death is a punch
For the sake of the Gods, you're not leading these men? How like my father you are. You 'believe'... I guess that's why you're still alive.
To think I brought my daughters up on all things Roman. Read to sleep on Catullus, Lucretius... Virgil... every night. My beautiful daughters.
Do you remember your Epictetus, that little homily we recited when we were children? The one that was supposed to remind us we were Romans?
"If you consider yourself to be only one thread of many in the tunic, then it is fitting for you to be like the rest of men, just as the thread has no desire to be any better than the other threads. But..."
"But what if I wish to be purple?"
You cannot die.

Narcissus, I have your family. They're alive. All of them.
Where are they?
Hidden. Where my brother cannot place hands on them. He didn't have the guts to watch them die so... I took care of it all. The sooner he is put out of our misery, the sooner will they be safe.
Commodus, it's we who are going on the offensive.
The fort helps position us for a final invasion in the spring when they're most vulnerable.
The fort helps position us for a final invasion in the spring when they're most vulnerable.
Commodus -- listen to Narcissus, listen to the man who has never lost a battle for Rome! You're young with years ahead of you before you gain the experience to wear the purple!
I want you to start your work for the last phase of the campaign.
I will, Marcus. But you're going to be well enough to direct it yourself.
I will, Marcus. But you're going to be well enough to direct it yourself.
I've made so many mistakes, Narcissus. We all put off the very last duties of our lives because we're afraid of admitting when our lives are over.

If I'd ever had a sign that you wanted to rule I would have... no, again, it's my own bullheadedness. Narcissus, I should have adopted you years ago. And now the Gods are begging me to make you my son!
Commodus is just a young man, he'll learn what you had to learn.
Commodus is just a young man, he'll learn what you had to learn.
It's not because he's young, it's because he's ignorant and arrogant. His sister is a better man. That's why I have undertaken to begin sweeping changes in the relationship between the emperor and the Senate.

So I understand.

Everyone talking about it? I wouldn't wonder. All I seek is a genuine balance of power between the Emperor and the Senate. Thus I have transferred legal power -- which was theirs to begin with -- back to the Senators. This includes a shared right to taxation too but some bite in the plan. It's a start, only a start.

A man should be upright, not be kept upright. History shows us that a good general is quick to recognize opportunities -- even if it means making a complete about face at the last minute. I want you to consider becoming my heir.

Marcus, you honor me, but I'm a soldier, politics scare the hell out of me.

The Senators admire you.

They fear me.
They fear me.
They fear change. The new Caesar must be honest enough to know when the emperorship is no longer feasible. You could be the one, the Emperor, the man who oversees the rebirth of the Republic.

I'll do anything in my power to help you restore the Republic but I can't be that power.
I made the plume from a quail feather.
Much more colorful than the ones we wear. And, of course, less dented.
Don't stop to visit -- take the children straight home and I'll follow as soon as I can.
Tomorrow?

As soon as I can.
As soon as I can.
On your honor as a Roman officer, daddy?

I see the emperor's little boy has finally caught up with the army.
Let's hope he doesn't start giving orders.
What the hell was all that about?
What the hell do you think it was about? There's nothing an unproved heir to the throne likes less than glaring competence in others.

Why don't we try to keep politics out of the conversation.

Well, we can try...
Serious stuff...
Centurions on both sides of the river are convinced the Germans will try one last offensive. They've got nothing to lose and it's so very like them.
Everyone knew you would have been outspoken against this deal.
What deal?
What deal?
Rome is going to pay an allotment to the German tribes on an annual basis.
Rome is going to pay tribute -- like a defeated nation begging for mercy? Have you told your troops that?
My troops don't make policy.
My troops don't make policy.
Well, they die for it!
On his death bed I promised Marcus I would complete our work here. The Senate may be vacillating, but I have the army behind me. I'm taking half a cohort and restocking that fort.
I can't let you do that.
You brought the army into Rome.
I was summoned.
I was summoned.
It's your job as a Roman officer to disobey such a summons.

Quintus, you've got at least a division with you -- we could take Rome away from Commodus and give it back to the Senate!

You seem to be doing a great job of it single-hand! Narcissus, the Republic is dead. You think those Senators could govern? For the last hundred and fifty years they've worked hard at kissing an endless succession of Imperial asses!

Then give the empire back to the people... the children who will grow up to become senators...
Then give the empire back to the people... the children who will grow up to become senators...
The 'people'?, listen to the people, they know what they want: A government that gives them what they need and doesn't bother them with messy thoughts of issues. You know, messy... thinking. They want a dictator! As far as the children, there is only one thing that every Roman child dreams of: being you! A famous gladiator!
What are you fighting for in here? The good of Rome? I can end this madness now! Take the job for the sake of the Gods, live!
Can you stop that slaughter?! Can you free these men?
He's very realistic.
Isn't the helmet magnificent?
Well, you wanted the girls to have the best teachers.
Greeks?
Greeks?
Athenians...
What about their philosophy lessons?
They're studying with Cynics.

Of course...
You need to come home!
I can see that...

The battle is over. The war is over. You've won!
The battle is over. The war is over. You've won!
If you win, you know, you have to stay. It's the losers who get to go home. Besides, I'm not so sure it is over. Centurions report enemy scouts probing our lines.
This is our oil from our estates?
I've been overseeing production myself for the past three years, you'll be surprised at how wonderful our oil has become.
Very fancy. Did you design the bottle?
Who else? I'm the one who runs the estates while you're here risking everything we have for the glory of Rome! Or for the glory of you!

We don't need your help we're doing great on our own.
I want to come home, of course I do, I'd have to be mad not to want that. It's just that Marcus trusts me.
Let him trust Quintus.
Let him trust Quintus.
Quintus is overly idealistic.

I never knew a more idealistic man than you.

When you get to Ostia, use this -- bribe passage to Africa or Spain. Save my family. You should be able to find a merchant ship that will take you to Egypt then to Numidia.
No!
You're not going! You have to stay with us!
How long do you think Commodus will let us live once he's in power? A month? Half a year? Paestum will be a prison where he'll hold us until it's time...

Do you want to see Themis and Manto butchered? If I die fighting Commodus he won't care about you. If I live I'll come and get you.
Do you want to see Themis and Manto butchered? If I die fighting Commodus he won't care about you. If I live I'll come and get you.
I don't want you to die!
I'll never die. You tell the girls that. You honor our ancestors and I'll be there. Every night. At the table of life.
Your daughters need more than some vapors; they need you!
Your daughters need more than some vapors; they need you!
They'll have me. Teach them. Don't let them become like these ignorant heaps of citizens without history, without philosophy, without meaning. Teach them of the Greeks, the Babylonians, the Hebrews, the Numidians, the Egyptians and the great Romans. Teach them, who we are!

That's what I'm going to do. That's what I'm going to do...
You're a legate in the Roman army. Huh...? and you act like one. What was your crime?
I killed too many barbarians.
I killed too many barbarians.
I'm a Greek, thank you. And I was brought up believing Romans were the barbarians. Give our new colleague some of the Cretan white. Relax, tell me everything, I'm your friend.
Who the hell are you?
I am the man who might save your life -- give you a bit more life at any rate. I am Proximo Palindromos head of this gladiatorial school which is named after me. I own this school and everything that's in it. You're in it! But why? What did a Roman general do to get himself condemned to the Colosseum? Understand, we usually get

Condemned? Aren't I owed a trial before being condemned?
Condemned? Aren't I owed a trial before being condemned?
General, all I know is you have been condemned to the Colosseum, and a trial is nowhere to be seen.
General, all I know is you have been condemned to the Colosseum, and a trial is nowhere to be seen.
Impossible! Every citizen has a right to trial -- this is Rome!
Thank you. What is going to happen tomorrow? Exactly?
You are to be killed, exactly. They'll give you a sporting chance, but just enough to make your murder... entertaining. Romans like to mix their metaphors: laughter with their executions, you know? If you survive, though, you will become a gladiator. A gladiator at least gets a fair fight.

Death is a very light thing for you.
Death is a very light thing for you.
Death is... everything for me. Now you have to go to your cell, and I to dicker with Jerses... you'll be fed well. I want you to be fit as you can be; I want you to win for me tomorrow! I want all my gladiators to win and be happy! Besides, I've never owned a Roman general before.
Take your hands off me animal!
Chain him.
Sorry but I have to get at least one fight out of you otherwise I won't even get back the cost of the bribe I had to pay the arena slaves to get you here. I know what you're trying to do: kill yourself and trust in the Roman tradition of justice that the emperor will let your family survive and keep their lands.
I refuse to be your slave. I refuse --
I refuse to be your slave. I refuse --
-- to fight? We'll see...
Legate Narcissus Meridas, general of the Spanish Felix Legions! I'm proud to have you in my school! Now, show them what you can do!
I'm not a gladiator. I refuse to fight.
I'm not a gladiator. I refuse to fight.
Then, you'll die... Just, know this: because you asked I asked: I'm sorry but...
General, do you realize what happened out there today?
I didn't get killed and everyone else did.
I didn't get killed and everyone else did.
That's one way to look at it.
At the end of the day I was approached by the Golden Pompeii Olive Oil company. Small, but profitable. They asked if you would endorse their oil. We could get some very nice posters. Make some very big money...
What would the poster say: "Narcissus would kill for a taste of Golden Pompeii Olive Oil?"
What would the poster say: "Narcissus would kill for a taste of Golden Pompeii Olive Oil?"
Think about it! Just think about it!
General, hang on... drink slowly. You are blessed by the Gods to have a physician and a Divine of Janus with you tonight. A fan sent them to you.
Alive... I'm alive...
Proximo, if this is her doctor he's an assassin.
Don't be ridiculous.
It will be good luck for you to wear that helmet... It belonged to Cimon of Smyrna... he was crushed by an elephant.
Lucky it didn't step on his head.
No more bad luck now! The people are anticipating you! I have posters up over half the city advertising you as the great warrior -- the true Roman! The man who fought side by side with the wolf of Rome!
Make us rich, Proximo, make us very rich...
Tiger's challenged you and Jerses has made me an offer, made us both an offer: you take a fall.
What the hell are you talking about, Greek?
You put this inside your shirt -- when Tiger stabs your stomach -- it's full of pig's blood. Gushes out everywhere! It's really impressive. Fantastic! Better than the real thing!
So I pretend I'm dead. You get gold, what do I get?
So I pretend I'm dead. You get gold, what do I get?
You get to come alive again in the country!
You get to come alive again in the country!
As, what, 'The Galloping Gladiator?!'

The point is you get to fight the easy country circuit, the small arenas, relax, live the good life!
The point is you get to fight the easy country circuit, the small arenas, relax, live the good life!
Spend my days beheading country bumpkins? I don't know, Proximo, who has better wine than you? Besides, I'm beginning to think of the Colosseum as my home.

But -- you have to go out there! I'll give you more than your one third! When I get paid... just take the fall! You're too hurt to fight and the man's a killer!
But -- you have to go out there! I'll give you more than your one third! When I get paid... just take the fall! You're too hurt to fight and the man's a killer!
Pressures on, eh Proximo? There's got to be a load of money in this. Why else would you toss a red hot commodity like me out the window?
Pressures on, eh Proximo? There's got to be a load of money in this. Why else would you toss a red hot commodity like me out the window?
It's absolutely not like that! This is for your own good! Come on get the rest of your armor on!
Tell me honestly, since this may be our last earthly meeting: if this were a fair fight where would you put your money?
On you! Of course! You are my bravest fighter -- the best fighter I have ever seen!
On you! Of course! You are my bravest fighter -- the best fighter I have ever seen!
Such nobility from such an ignoble mouth. Take my advice and make that bet.
Such nobility from such an ignoble mouth. Take my advice and make that bet.
Oh, shit. Take your time! Don't get suckered! This man is a murderer! In his career he's killed over a thousand gladiators. Please, just take the fall!
How much money is involved?
A great deal. They designed and build Tiger's chariot...

Fantastic! Wonderful! But posters are very expensive.

I want another interview with Cos. Tell him to bring plenty of ink.
I want another interview with Cos. Tell him to bring plenty of ink.
I'll do it! Sure as there's shit in the Tiber we're all going to die, but for you -- anything!
So, things change. The government has moved to the circus. You're going to fight last. And Commodus is going to fight first.
You were a soldier, and then a gladiator, weren't you?
You were a soldier, and then a gladiator, weren't you?
Was I?
Let's talk about this later. Right now we have other things to settle. You and your family will be leaving with a supply ship returning in the morning to Ostia. From there, Caesar has decreed you be given an estate in Paestum. It's beautiful; an old Greek town right on the ocean. Rich soil. Perhaps we could keep our financial arrangements... although Caesar will
I want nothing to do with the arena.
I want nothing to do with the arena.
Something else, then. Do the chariot races interest you?
Commodus must hate you. Free your gladiators and come with us.
Are you mad? With all this unrest the Colosseum will be open day and night! Anyway, I'm not political, I'm in the entertainment business.
Hello.
Hello.
You're living at home now. Is that right?
Yes.
Yes.
Do you know what you're going to do?

Aren't you eating?

Why not?

If it's all right with you, I'm not hungry.
Benjamin -- do you dislike me for some reason?
No -- why should I?
No -- why should I?
I don't know.
Could you do it?
No.
Will you take me home now?
I'm sorry I took you in there.

Oh -- that's very nice of you to tell me.
Oh -- that's very nice of you to tell me.
No. What I mean is -- that's why I've been acting this way. I'm not like this. I hate myself like this.
Listen -- could you stop crying, please?
No, I couldn't.
No, I couldn't.
But could you try?
But could you try?
No.
I've had this feeling -- ever since I've graduated -- this -- kind of compulsion that I have to be rude all the time. Do you know what I mean?
Yes, I do.
Would you like to come in? I could make some coffee.
No, I mean -- I wouldn't want to wake anyone up.
No, I mean -- I wouldn't want to wake anyone up.
We won't. Let's go inside.

Isn't there one in the Taft Hotel?
What is the matter?
Nothing. I'm just wondering if they have a bar or not. I mean let's go see. Let's go see if they do or not.
Listen, Elaine -- it seems to me that there isn't a bar in here. I mean -- as far as I know.
Of course there is. Look -- The Veranda Room -- right there.
Benjamin --
Let's get out of here, Elaine. Let's go somewhere else.
Let's get out of here, Elaine. Let's go somewhere else.
Benjamin -- do they know you?
Benjamin -- do they know you?
Of course not.
Ben -- what's happening? Who is Mr. Gladstone?
I don't know. They must think I look like this guy Gladstone.
Do you?
Yes.
Yes.
You're the first -- you're the first thing for so long that I've liked. The first person I could stand to be with.
I'm sorry. That is not my business.
It just happened. It was just this thing that happened along with everything else. Can you understand that?
Was she married or something?
Yes.
Yes.
With a family?
With a family?
Yes. She had a husband and a son.

Did they ever find out?

No.
Where did he say he was going to meet you?

I've got a real feeling that this is the fellow.
I want to ask you a question.
Come in.

All right then! Yes!
All right then! Yes!
Well, I want you to leave.
Well, I want you to leave.
Elaine -- I love you.
Elaine -- I love you.
How could you do that, Benjamin?
Do you just hate everything? How could you possibly rape my...
What?
What?
I don't understand --
I don't understand --
Did you say rape her?
Did you say rape her?
-- how you -- how anyone -- could do a thing like that.

What did she say?

Let me go.
Let me go.
You've got to tell me what she said.
Why?
Because it isn't true.
Because it isn't true.
I don't feel well.
She said she was having a drink in the hotel with a friend. You waited for her in the parking lot and told her she was too drunk to drive home and that you would get her a room for the night.
Then what?
Then what?
Then you took her upstairs and you raped her.
Then you took her upstairs and you raped her.
Elaine -- that is not what happened.
Please let me go.
All right -- but listen to me. What happened was there was this party at my parents. I drove your mother home -- then we went upstairs to see your portrait --
Don't tell me --
-- and when we got up in the room she starts taking her her clothes off -- and --
-- and when we got up in the room she starts taking her her clothes off -- and --
Benjamin -- this is my mother!
Benjamin -- this is my mother!
-- suddenly there she was without any clothes on -- I mean really naked --
Benjamin, when you came up here, what did you think was going to happen between us?
Elaine -- right now I don't feel like talking much. I'm sorry about everything but I think I'll just do this now.
Can I just sit here while you're packing?
If you want.
What are you looking for?
My belt.
My belt.
Don't you have it on?
Don't you have it on?
No. I have two. The other one is the one I'm looking for. What's this? It's from my grandmother.

Are you going home?

Goodbye.
Benjamin?

Will you kiss me!
You won't?
I don't know.

I don't know. I don't know what's happening.
You mean you're confused?
Well -- look -- don't be confused. We're getting married.
I don't see how we can.
I don't see how we can.
We just can.
We just can.

I never did, Benjamin. Now let's --
I never did, Benjamin. Now let's --

I can't see why you did, unless... you didn't have to marry him or anything, did you?
I can't see why you did, unless... you didn't have to marry him or anything, did you?
Don't tell Elaine.
Don't tell Elaine.
Oh no. You had to marry him because you got pregnant?

Are you shocked?

A Ford! A Ford! Goddamnit, a Ford! That's great!
A Ford! A Ford! Goddamnit, a Ford! That's great!
That's enough.

So old Elaine Robinson got started in a Ford.
Don't talk about Elaine.
Don't talk about Elaine?
Don't talk about Elaine?
No.
No.
Why not?
Why not?
Because I don't want you to.
I wish you'd tell me.
There's nothing to tell.
There's nothing to tell.
Well why is she a big taboo subject all of a sudden?
Well -- I guess I'll have to ask her out on a date and find out what's --
Benjamin, don't you ever take that girl out.
Do you understand that?
Well look. I have no intention of taking her out.

I have my reasons.
I have my reasons.
Then let's hear them.
Then let's hear them.
No.
No.
Let's hear your reasons, Mrs. Robinson. Because I think I know what they are.
I'm not good enough for her to associate with, am I? I'm not good enough to even talk about her, am I?
Let's drop it.
Let's drop it.
We're not dropping it. Now that's the reason, isn't it? I'm a dirty degenerate, aren't I? I'm not fit to --
We're not dropping it. Now that's the reason, isn't it? I'm a dirty degenerate, aren't I? I'm not fit to --
Benjamin?
Benjamin?
I'm good enough for you but I'm too slimy to associate with your daughter. That's it, isn't it? ISN'T IT?
I'm good enough for you but I'm too slimy to associate with your daughter. That's it, isn't it? ISN'T IT?
Yes.
Yes.
You go to hell. You go straight to hell, Mrs. Robinson. Do you think I'm proud of myself? Do you think I'm proud of this?
You go to hell. You go straight to hell, Mrs. Robinson. Do you think I'm proud of myself? Do you think I'm proud of this?
I wouldn't know.

Well, I'm not.
Well, I'm not.
You're not.
You're not.
No sir. I am not proud that I spend my time with a broken-down alcoholic!
No sir. I am not proud that I spend my time with a broken-down alcoholic!
I see.
I see.
And if you think I come here for any reason besides pure boredom, then you're all wrong.
Because -- Mrs. Robinson this is the sickest, most perverted thing that ever happened to me. And you do what you want but I'm getting the hell out.
Are you?
Are you?
You're goddamn right I am.
That I'm a sick and disgusting person.
Now don't start this.
Now don't start this.
What?
What?
Don't start acting hurt.

Don't you expect me to be a little hurt?
Don't you expect me to be a little hurt?
Mrs. Robinson, you stand there and tell me I'm not good enough for your daughter.
Mrs. Robinson, you stand there and tell me I'm not good enough for your daughter.
Did I say that?
Did I say that?
Of course you did.
Benjamin, I want to apologize to you if that's the impression you got.
Well two minutes ago you told me I wasn't good enough for your daughter. Now you say you're sorry I got that impression.
Well two minutes ago you told me I wasn't good enough for your daughter. Now you say you're sorry I got that impression.
I didn't mean it. I don't think you'd be right for each other. But I would never say you weren't as good a person as she is.
I didn't mean it. I don't think you'd be right for each other. But I would never say you weren't as good a person as she is.
You wouldn't.

Of course I wouldn't.
What are you doing?
Well it's pretty obvious you don't want me around any more.

But if it's sickening for you --

You don't have to say that.

May I stay then?
May I stay then?
Yes. Please. I want you to.
Yes. Please. I want you to.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Well don't thank me, because I want you to.
Look. Why the hell did you bring this up. It never occurred to me to take her out.
Then give me your word you won't.
Then give me your word you won't.
This is absurd.
This is absurd.
Promise me, Benjamin.
Promise me, Benjamin.
All right, for christ's sake. I promise I will never take out Elaine Robinson.
All right, for christ's sake. I promise I will never take out Elaine Robinson.
Thank you. Benjamin --
Thank you. Benjamin --
Let's not talk about it. Let's not talk at all.
Now listen -- this was not my idea. It was my father's idea.
Benjamin -- I thought I made myself perfectly clear about this.
Benjamin -- I thought I made myself perfectly clear about this.
Look, we'll go out to dinner and have a drink and I'll bring her back. Because it was either that or a dinner party for the two families. And I'm afraid I couldn't quite handle that, if you don't mind. I have no intention of ever taking your precious daughter out again in her life. So don't get upset about it.

Drive down the block.
Mrs. Robinson -- I have a date with Elaine. We're going for a drive.
Mrs. Robinson -- I have a date with Elaine. We're going for a drive.
Do exactly what I say.
Now it seems to me --
Listen to me very carefully, Benjamin. You are not to see Elaine again. Ever. Those are my orders. Is that clear?
Mrs. Robinson --
I can makes things quite unpleasant.
I can makes things quite unpleasant.
How?

In order to keep Elaine away from you -- I am prepared to tell her everything.

Mrs. Robinson, don't wreck it. I'm asking you please not to wreck it.
Mrs. Robinson, don't wreck it. I'm asking you please not to wreck it.
Go home now.
Go home now.
I just don't believe you would do that.
Hello. Get me the police, please.
Where is Elaine?
Where is Elaine?
I'll be with you in a moment, Benjamin. Will you send a police car to twelve hundred Glenview Road. We have a burgler here. Just a second. I'll ask him. Are you armed? No -- I don't believe he is. Thank you.
What have you done to her?
I think we have everything quite under control now, Benjamin. Would you like a quick drink before you go?
You can't stop me from seeing her, Mrs. Robinson. I'll find her.
I'm sorry we won't be able to invite you to the wedding, Benjamin, but the arrangements have been so rushed --
I'm sorry we won't be able to invite you to the wedding, Benjamin, but the arrangements have been so rushed --
What the hell have you done?
Ahh. I don't think you'll have time for that drink after all.

Meet someone?
Why did you say that?
Well this is your business, Benjamin. If you --
Well this is your business, Benjamin. If you --
No wait. Wait.
I don't meet anyone, mother, but why did you say that?
Benjamin, I'm not going to pry into your affairs, but I'd rather you didn't say anything at all than be dishonest. Goodnight, Benjamin.
Benjamin, I'm not going to pry into your affairs, but I'd rather you didn't say anything at all than be dishonest. Goodnight, Benjamin.
Well, wait.
Well why do you -- why do you think that?
Because I know you don't drive around for twelve hours.

But I don't want you to make up something.
But I don't want you to make up something.
I'm not. But I'm -- I'm not very proud of what I do. I usually get kind of drunk. I usually drive over to Los Angeles and go to some bars and get kind of drunk. Then I take a hotel room. So I won't have to drive home on the freeway. I mean it kind of scares me to drive home after --

No.
No.
You don't?
But I want you to. Please. Please will you believe me.
Goodnight.
It's pretty embarrassing. I really don't know what to tell Mr. Robinson. It's awkward and strained for me every time he suggests that you call up Elaine.
Next time he suggests it, I'll tell him I have no intention of ever calling her up in my life.
Don't go on like this. Now if Benjamin absolutely refuses to take her out --
I do.
I do.
-- then I'll simply invite all the Robinsons' over for dinner on Thursday.
I'm going up to Berkeley today.
Oh, Ben -- this is so -- exciting --
They don't know?
No -- they don't.
No -- they don't.
Well -- when did you decide all this?
Well -- when did you decide all this?
About an hour ago.
When did you two talk this over?
We haven't.
I'm just --

Have you thought about graduate school?

No.
No.
Would you mind telling me then -- what were those four years of college for? What was the point of all that hard work?
Would you mind telling me then -- what were those four years of college for? What was the point of all that hard work?
You got me.
You got me.
Now listen, Ben. I think it's a very good thing that a young man -- after he's done some very good work -- should have a chance to relax and enjoy himself, and lie around, and drink beer and so on. But after a few weeks I believe that person would want to take some stock in himself and his situation and start to
I guess she's not good enough for you, is that it?
Look -- Elaine Robinson and I do not get along.
Look -- Elaine Robinson and I do not get along.
How do you know? You haven't seen her since high school. I guess your evenings, whatever you do with them, are just too valuable.
How do you know? You haven't seen her since high school. I guess your evenings, whatever you do with them, are just too valuable.
That has nothing to do with it --
That has nothing to do with it --
I guess I'll just tell Mr. Robinson that you're just too busy every evening -- doing God knows what --
Say that again.
I'm going to marry Elaine Robinson.
Come on, let's call the Robinsons. We've got something to celebrate.
No. I think you'll want to wait on that.
Wait a minute. You talked to Elaine this morning?
No. She doesn't know about it.
No. She doesn't know about it.
She doesn't know that you're coming up to Berkeley?
She doesn't know that you're coming up to Berkeley?
No. Actually -- she doesn't know about us getting married yet.
Ben -- this whole idea sounds pretty half-baked.
No -- it's not. It's completely baked. It's a decision I've made.
I drove -- I drove Mrs. Robinson home. She wanted me to drive her home so I -- I drove her home.
Swell. I appreciate it.
Swell. I appreciate it.
She's upstairs. She wanted me to wait down here till you got home.
She's upstairs. She wanted me to wait down here till you got home.

Is anything wrong? You look a little shaken up.

I've watched you grow up, Ben.

I'd like to hear it.
I'd like to hear it.
Ben -- I think -- I think you ought to be taking it a little easier right now than you seem to.
You have yourself a few flings this summer. I bet you're quite a ladies' man.
Oh no.
Oh no.
What? You look like the kind of guy that has to fight them off. Doesn't he look to you like the kind of guy who has to fight them off?
Oh say -- Elaine gets down from Berkeley on Saturday.
Oh yes.
Oh yes.
Ben -- I want you to give her a call.
Ben -- I want you to give her a call.
I will.

Great.
Hi, Ben. What are you doing with yourself these days?
Oh -- not too much. Taking it easy.

That's what I'd do if I could. Nothing wrong with that. Hey Ben, Elaine's coming down from Berkeley soon. I want you to call her up this time.
That's what I'd do if I could. Nothing wrong with that. Hey Ben, Elaine's coming down from Berkeley soon. I want you to call her up this time.

Hello.
What would you say to a short one? Bourbon still your drink?

It was nothing to do with you, sir.

Well, Ben, it was quite a bit to do with me.
Now look -- please --

No, I don't.
No, I don't.
Well, I don't think we have a whole lot to say to each other, Ben. I do think you should know the consequences of what you've done. I do think you should know that my wife and I are getting a divorce soon.

It shouldn't make any difference what happened.

That's quite a statement.
That's quite a statement.
Listen to me. We got -- we got into bed with each other. But it was nothing. It was nothing at all. We might -- we might just as well have been shaking hands.
Listen to me. We got -- we got into bed with each other. But it was nothing. It was nothing at all. We might -- we might just as well have been shaking hands.
Shaking hands. Well, that's not saying much for my wife, is it?

You miss the point.

Don't shout at me, Ben.

The point is -- I don't love your wife. I love your daughter, sir.
The point is -- I don't love your wife. I love your daughter, sir.
Well -- I'm sure you think you do, Ben, but after a few times in bed with Elaine I feel quite sure you'd get over that as quickly as you --
Well -- I'm sure you think you do, Ben, but after a few times in bed with Elaine I feel quite sure you'd get over that as quickly as you --
HUH?
HUH?
I think I've talked about this enough. I don't know how far I can go, Ben. I don't know if I can prosecute or not, but I think maybe I can. In the light of what's happened I think maybe I can get you behind bars if you ever look at my daughter again. I have seen Elaine and I have spent the afternoon
Hello.

Can you look through the glass.
Can you see me now?
Yes, I can.
Are you ready in there, feature attraction?
Could I speak to you for a second, Dad?
Dad -- could we just talk about this for a second?
Twenty-one-years-old, ladies and gentlemen; four of those years spent accomplishing some rather extraordinary things at one of our nation's leading seats of learning --
I can't hold them much longer, Ben. You better get out here.
I'd like to discuss this.
I'd like to discuss this.
This boy -- I'm sorry -- this young man -- is soon to continue his education as a Frank Halpingham Award Scholar -- but before he does --

Dad -- can you listen --
Dad -- can you listen --
I'll give you ten seconds. He is going to give us a practical demonstration of what I feel safe in saying is a pretty exciting birthday present -- and it better work or I'm out over two hundred bucks -- so let's hear it for --
Is anything wrong?
No! No -- we're just on our way downstairs!
The Carlsons' are here.
They are? Come on.

It's a wonderful thing to have so many devoted friends.
What's happening?

I don't believe it.

That what he says. Right?
Turn 'em up.
Oh yes -- that's right -- look! I win, don't I --
I'm having luck for the first time in my life.
Your bank, Mr. Kringelein.
I oughtn't to presume, but I -- I'm so grateful to you -- it's been so marvelous. The first time in my life I have gambled -- I've danced! Oh, you can laugh, gentlemen, but it's the first time in my life I've ever tasted life!
Splendid!
Life, gentlemen, is wonderful, but very dangerous. You must have courage for it, then it's wonderful. You gentlemen don't know that because you are all healthy and happy, but I -- believe me -- a man must know death and not until then does a man know anything about life.
Rejoice in life while yet the small lamp burns.
It's a short life and a gay one...
Every glass high to life -- the splendid, dangerous, mighty, brief -- brief life -- and the courage to live it. Baron, you know -- I've only lived since last night -- but that little while seems longer than all the time before -- all the --
Have you a minute now?

You could love me. It is so long since I have heard that word. Nobody has loved me for a long time. It is so icy-cold to be famous. One is so cruelly alone. How is it that you -- Let me look at you. Your hands. Your eyes. Why could you love me?

Just for a minute then.
The stage frays one's nerves... the discipline -- it's so exacting. Discipline means doing what you don't want to do and take no pleasure in doing. Do you know what I mean? Have you ever experienced the weariness that comes from discipline?
I? -- Oh, no. I do only what I take pleasure in doing.
I see -- you do only what you take pleasure in doing. You take pleasure in coming into a woman's bedroom and you come. You take pleasure in a dangerous climb onto a balcony, so you do it... And what is your pleasure now?
I should like to smoke.
Why do you smile?
Because I can see something in the mirror that you cannot. My dear --

What can you see?

You are beautiful!
You are beautiful!
No.
No.
Beautiful but so sad. I did not know it was so dangerous to look into a woman's bedroom.
I'm not going... You know that I'm not going... Do you think I could leave you alone here? After that --?
What?
What?
The veronal -- you. I'm going to stay here with you.
The veronal -- you. I'm going to stay here with you.
I want to be alone.
I want to be alone.
That is not the truth. You do not want to be alone -- you're afraid of being alone -- I know you're afraid. I know you. You were desperate, just now, if I go away you'll be more desperate than ever. Say I am to stay with you... say it.
Oh -- I was ambitious then -- ambition was in my blood -- no rest, no stopping. We were drilled like little soldiers -- We danced in the school of the Imperial Ballet, in St. Petersburg. I was little and slim but hard as diamond -- a duty machine -- No rest, no stopping. And then -- I became famous and whoever is famous
I am Felix Benvenuto von Gaigern. My mother called me Flix.

No doubt you would, Baron. But do you know, I'm quite indispensable to her. I'm her ballet master and her nurse. I hardly belong to myself anymore. But, there you are, it's Grusinskaya -- you can't help adoring her.

Please, Baron -- forgive me -- not now -- here she is.
Pardon me, the lady has urgent business here with me.
Insolent -- Berlin manners.
Oh, let the poor devil alone.

We shall see who remains here the longer.

Aha! -- The Baron. What do you want here?
I must have made a mistake.
I must have made a mistake.
Made a mistake -- remarkable. We shall soon see if you made a mistake. Stay here... Give me that money.

And ask me what it's costing us to hammer it down.
Exactly.

If the Preysing people get the Manchester contract, we shall certainly merge with the Preysing company -- but if they haven't they're ruined -- Preysing will have to declare himself.

Now to proceed with the projected merger, the advantages for the Saxonia are so obvious...

Goodbye, Preysing, I hope you pull through. This is a very bad time to be in such a crisis. We've...
Why talk -- it's over -- it's over -- it's finished. You've broken off negotiations. You did it. You're calling them off. You had nothing on your mind all day, but Manchester, -- Manchester -- Manchester.

See you soon, Preysing. Next week we'll meet and discuss further details.

How clear is Manchester?
Foggy -- frightfully foggy, always, I'm told. Have you said anything about Manchester, Mr. Preysing?
Since, on the eleventh of June of this year -- when the first negotiations for a merger...

...and let me say again for the tenth time... ...you people were quite ready for the merger. You declared yourselves... fully agreed on all the terms -- Why should the signing of these articles be suddenly held up?
I've admitted that at one time we had reason for desiring ther merger -- What reason have we now? The Preysing Company has fallon upon evil days, very evil days.
Mr. Preysing has too scrupulous a regard for certainties...
You've talked enough today, you're hoarse now.
Here's my signature -- here Preysing, sign here.
What a session this has been.
Nine-thirty, Mr. Preysing keeps us waiting.

Every seat for the opening has been sold at Vienna. Sold out for three days.
Every seat for the opening has been sold at Vienna. Sold out for three days.
I know -- I know -- but it will be sunny in Tremezzo. We'll have a guest then.
It is time for the performance.
The performance -- the performance -- the performance.
It is not stage fright -- it's something more --
What -- what is it? Last night...
What -- what is it? Last night...
Last night?... There was no applause.
Last night?... There was no applause.
There was -- there was.
There was -- there was.
That theatre -- half empty -- dancing for those few -- I was frantic -- I finished -- the last beat and... ...I waited -- I listened -- but the applause didn't come -- nothing. A man in the box -- and just the claques behind -- it is passed, Pimenov. We are dead -- it's finished.
Good morning, Pimenov.
Good morning, Gru -- your --
Gru -- you are positively radiant.
Yes, Pimenov. One minute, Suzette, I will call you.
He will be on the train.
But when did he go? How do you know?
Mr. Kringelein will take room number one-seventy-six, one of our most expensive rooms. It is large and on the front with bath.
Does that mean that the bath is my own? --- Private?
Does that mean that the bath is my own? --- Private?
Certainly, sir.
Certainly, sir.
Well, now, that's very kind -- thanks. That's what I want -- a large room on the front with a private bath -- Yes, that's what I want. I can pay now if you like.
Will Mr. Kringelein kindly register.
Again?
Again?
Please.
I wish you a very good evening, Mr. Preysing. You are staying here, too, Mr. Preysing?
I don't know you.
I don't know you.
Oh -- you must know me -- Kringelein at the plant. Assistant bookkeeper, building C, room twenty-three -- third floor.
Mr. Kringelein will be a good friend and not accept your invitation to dance.
I could not think of not accepting.
I could not think of not accepting.
You say that you are employed by us in Fredersdorf, and here you are in Berlin, indulging in diversions which ill befit your position and which are very much beyond your means -- Quite extraordinary, Mr. Kringelein, I think we will look into your books.
Well now, Miss Flaemm, we can talk.
Some champagne, Miss Flaemm?
Some champagne, Miss Flaemm?
You may go, Mr. Kringelein.
You may go, Mr. Kringelein.
Does the world belong to you, Mr. Preysing?
Does the world belong to you, Mr. Preysing?
What is this insolence?
What is this insolence?
Do you think you have free license to be insulting? Believe me you have not. You think you're superior, but you're quite an ordinary man.
Do you think you have free license to be insulting? Believe me you have not. You think you're superior, but you're quite an ordinary man.
Go away -- go away.
Who are you? -- An embezzler most likely.
An embezzler -- you're going to take that back, right here in the presence of this young lady -- who do you think you're talking to? You think I'm dirt, if I'm dirt, you're a lot dirtier, Mr. Industrial Magnate Preysing.

You're discharged.
You're discharged.
Me?

Yes you -- shut your mouth -- get out -- you're discharged.
Oh -- the Baron -- the Baron.
He tried to rob me -- he is dead --

Her room -- oh -- I see, Mr. Preysing -- I understand, Mr. General Director Preysing.

We must call the police, your excellency.
How much -- how much do you want -- you need money -- you have nothing.
Don't worry about me, Mr. General Director Pryesing -- worry about yourself. There has been a murder -- this is room one sixty-four.
If you will wait one moment, sir.
I won't wait -- I can't wait -- I waited three days before I got a room at all and what a room that is.
I won't wait -- I can't wait -- I waited three days before I got a room at all and what a room that is.
It's a very nice room and inexpensive, sir.
It's a very nice room and inexpensive, sir.
Did I say I wanted a cheap room to live in -- when I came here did I ask for a cheap room? Did I?
Just one moment, sir.
No, I won't wait -- I can't -- Every day is precious -- every hour -- Every minute.
The gentleman is dissatisfied with room number five fifty-nine.
I certainly have a complaint -- and a fair one.
We will wait.
You are late. Hurry.
How is the house?
Terrible. After this, no more ballets for me. Jazz -- Just jazz.

If the house is empty again, I don't know --

When she gets her paint on and hears the music -- she'll be all right. I know these people.
What's the use of asking, Gru -- he is at the train -- He will be there.
The troupe, the scenery, everything -- all on board, waiting. You have a rehearsal in Vienna tomorrow morning. Come, Madam, are you mad?
Four minutes past. Please come.
Come, Lisaveta, he will be there -- he will be there.
Come, Lisaveta, he will be there -- he will be there.

Ach! Here you are, Doctor Zinnowitz.
Have I kept you waiting?
Have I kept you waiting?
Waiting -- I'm waiting for news from Manchester.
Waiting -- I'm waiting for news from Manchester.
No news yet?

No. No word.
No. No word.
Everything depends on the Manchester merger.
Everything depends on the Manchester merger.
I know -- I know.
I know -- I know.
I saw Gerstenkorn at lunch -- and as your lawyer I made it my business to broach the matter ---
No news from Manchester yet -- Do you think we ought to postpone the conference?
Good heavens no. That'd create the very worst impression. You must be optimistic. You must convince them. You know as well as I do that the merger must go through.
Good heavens no. That'd create the very worst impression. You must be optimistic. You must convince them. You know as well as I do that the merger must go through.
Yes -- the merger must go through -- But I am used to making my deals on a solid basis. I am not a liar. I am an honest business man -- a good husband and father -- I have a sense of honor -- I have nothing to conceal. I couldn't live happily otherwise.

Well, don't get excited about it. We agreed that the merger with the Saxonia people must go through.

Good morning, gentlemen -- I see the conference is already underway.
Oh, here you are, Justice Zinnowitz -- I'm at cross-purposes with these gentlemen -- will you clear up the situation?
Oh, here you are, Justice Zinnowitz -- I'm at cross-purposes with these gentlemen -- will you clear up the situation?
But the situation is perfectly clear, If you will allow me --
I can make no statement about Manchester at this time.
Well -- gentlemen.
Next week.
You let me talk till I'm hoarse and you had Manchester sewed-up all the time. Why?
What's the matter with you?
Bluff -- Bluff -- all bluff.

You must go to Manchester at once yourself and really see it through.

Bluff does it, Preysing, bluff does it. Goodnight.
Hi, Bobo.
Did I buy you that dress, you piece of shit?
Well, I guess so. You're the guy I work for.
You work for me, huh? Then I just may flush you down the toilet. Drive me to the Durando.
How'd you figure you were gonna get away with that?
I'm not getting away with anything, Bobo.
I'm not getting away with anything, Bobo.
You're fuckin right you're not. How much did your pals cut you in for on that nag, huh? Or did they give you the same kind of screwing you gave me?
You're fuckin right you're not. How much did your pals cut you in for on that nag, huh? Or did they give you the same kind of screwing you gave me?
I was down on that horse, Bobo. Not as much as I should have been, but there was a lot of action on those--
One question. Do you want to stick to that story, or do you want to keep your teeth?
I want to keep my teeth.
I want to keep my teeth.
Now I'll ask you another. You think I got no contacts out here? That nag paid off at just the opening price. There wasn't hardly a flutter on the tote board from the time the odds were posted. There ain't enough action to tickle the tote, but you claim a ten grand win! You send me ten thousand dollars, like I'm some mark you

It'll never happen again. I swear.
It'll never happen again. I swear.
It happened once. With me, that's making a habit of it.
You're calling the shots.
You got any kind of long coat in the car? Anything you can wear home over your clothes?

No.
No.
I'll loan you a raincoat.
You ever hear about the oranges?
You mean, the insurance frammis?
You mean, the insurance frammis?
Tell me about the oranges, Lilly.
You hit a person with the oranges in the towel, they get big, awful looking bruises, but they don't really get hurt, not if you do it right. It's for working scams against insurance companies.
And if you do it wrong?
And if you do it wrong?
It can louse up your insides. You can get puh, puh, puh...
It can louse up your insides. You can get puh, puh, puh...
What's that, Lilly?
Permanent damage.
You'll never shit right again.
Almost forgot. That ten grand of yours. It's in the envelope by the door.
Oh, thanks, Bobo.
Oh, thanks, Bobo.
You want a drink?
You want a drink?
Gee, I better not, if it's okay. I still gotta drive back up to Los Ang-gleez.
Gee, I better not, if it's okay. I still gotta drive back up to Los Ang-gleez.
See your son, huh? Well, that's nice. A side of you I didn't know, Lilly.
He's a good kid. A salesman.
On the square, huh? And how are you making out these days? Stealing much?
Not skimming a thing, Lilly?
Oh, well, you know. I just clip a buck here and a buck there. Not enough to notice.
Oh, well, you know. I just clip a buck here and a buck there. Not enough to notice.
That's right. Take a little, leave a little.
That's right. Take a little, leave a little.
A person that don't look out for himself is too dumb to look out for anybody else. He's a liability, right, Bobo?
A person that don't look out for himself is too dumb to look out for anybody else. He's a liability, right, Bobo?
You're a thousand percent right!
You're a thousand percent right!
Or else he's working an angle. If he doesn't steal a little, he's steeling big.
Or else he's working an angle. If he doesn't steal a little, he's steeling big.
You know it, Lilly.
You know it, Lilly.
You know, I like that suit, Bobo. I don't know what there is about it, but it somehow makes you look taller.

Yeah? You really think so? A lot of people been telling me the same thing.

Your kid's in the back here. He's crying.

The kids beat him up, because his home life is, uh, different.
The kids beat him up, because his home life is, uh, different.

Come on, kid, let's see if there's any food in the house.
Hah.
Evening. Welcome to Phoenix.
Good evening. I'd like a single for tonight.
Good evening. I'd like a single for tonight.
Oh, everything's the same size, same price.
I'm a very light sleeper, traffic noise keeps me wide awake all night.
Those trucks. I know exactly what you mean.
Those trucks. I know exactly what you mean.
Do you have something around back, facing away from the road?
I'll put you in one thirty-one. Very quiet. Faces the desert.
Sounds perfect. I can park my car back there?
Sounds perfect. I can park my car back there?
Right in front of the room.
Right in front of the room.
Fine.
And I'll want to leave an early wake-up call.
No problem. My husband gets up the crack of dawn. It's his kidneys.
Mary Beth, what we have here, uh...
Oh, I told Mister Hebbing all about it, how brilliant you are at making money for your special clients!
Oh, I told Mister Hebbing all about it, how brilliant you are at making money for your special clients!
Mary Beth, I hope you aren't spreading this good news too widely.
Mary Beth, I hope you aren't spreading this good news too widely.
Well, of course not! I know how dangerous this is. But I would trust Mister Hebbing with anything. Wouldn't I, darling?
Well, I'll have to take your word for it, Mary Beth. Here's your money.
Goody!
Henry, next time, couldn't Mister Hebbing --
Mary Beth! This has never been anything but --
Mary Beth! This has never been anything but --
Oh, I know, I know, and you've been wonderful since I was widowed. But Mister Hebbing has-- -- you don't mind my telling him, darling -- -- suffered reverses. If he could...
Well. If Mary Beth vouches for you, and if she told you the story already...
So here we are!
So here we are!
Mister Hebbing, we are talking about breaking the law here, I want to be sure you understand that. No one gets hurt, but the law does get broken.
Want a look?
Oh, Henry, no, that's just boring.
Come take a look. An entire-suite of main-frame computer.
We're not really interested, Henry.
You ruined me! You destroyed me!
Henry, no!
Cole, it'll be all right. Honey?
Can't move.
Can't move.
It's just the strain again, the stress. We'll take a vacation.
It's just the strain again, the stress. We'll take a vacation.
It's all hollow. Nothing behind it.
Demon! Demon! That's why you can walk on it! Demon!
Oh, Cole, please. Please come out of it. What would I do without you?
Well, that's what the law's for, isn't it?
And I don't just mean the SEC. We could have the FBI breathing down our necks.
And I don't just mean the SEC. We could have the FBI breathing down our necks.
I certainly hope not.
I certainly hope not.
Loose talk is the one thing I worry about.
Loose talk is the one thing I worry about.
I can keep my mouth shut, Mister Fellowes.
The Tokyo Exchange is nine hours ahead of us, New York one hour behind. There isn't one hour of the day when both are open. Information moves, but it has to wait. Now, we have a young fellow working here -- Do you know what a hacker is, Mister Hebbing?
One of those computer geniuses, isn't it?
One of those computer geniuses, isn't it?
You're right! And this boy tapped into that main link between Tokyo and the New York Stock Exchange. He can give us, when it's really useful, a seven second delay in that movement of information. Do you know what that means?
Well, you've got your information ahead of New York, I see that.
Every once in a while, a major change comes through. We have seven seconds to take advantage, put our buy order, our sell order, into the computer in New York before the Tokyo data comes in.
Every once in a while, a major change comes through. We have seven seconds to take advantage, put our buy order, our sell order, into the computer in New York before the Tokyo data comes in.
Not much time.

We have to be ready. We have to have the money, and we have to know what the information means, and we have to move immediately.
We have to be ready. We have to have the money, and we have to know what the information means, and we have to move immediately.
Seven seconds. I don't see how you do it.
Seven seconds. I don't see how you do it.
These machines -- They're in here.
Here you are! Two rich people!
I must admit, Mister Fellowes, I had moments I was worried.
I must admit, Mister Fellowes, I had moments I was worried.
You brought a case? Good.
The ambulance is on the way, for what good it will do.
What? He's going to be all right!
What? He's going to be all right!
Mrs. Dillon, your son was in some sort of accident. He's had an internal hemorrhage, he's bleeding to death inside.
Mrs. Dillon, your son was in some sort of accident. He's had an internal hemorrhage, he's bleeding to death inside.
Well, make it stop!

His blood pressure is under a hundred. I don't think he'll live to get to the hospital.
His blood pressure is under a hundred. I don't think he'll live to get to the hospital.
You know who I work for.
Yes, yes, but that's --
My son will be all right. If he isn't, I'll have you killed.
Bobo wants you to go on to Delmar.
Delmar? I never go out to California. That's a thousand miles from here.
Delmar? I never go out to California. That's a thousand miles from here.
Nine hundred. Bobo needs somebody to handle playback this time. Come on, Lilly, you don't argue with Bobo.
Nine hundred. Bobo needs somebody to handle playback this time. Come on, Lilly, you don't argue with Bobo.
I know.
I know.
Take two, three days. Call when you get there.
Take two, three days. Call when you get there.
Maybe I'll swing around Los Ang gleez on the way.
Mrs. Langtry, I'm sorry.
Why? What's wrong?
Why? What's wrong?
You are a valued customer, as you know.
You are a valued customer, as you know.
But what's wrong?
But what's wrong?
I can't understand a thing like this. It's something you almost never see.
I can't understand a thing like this. It's something you almost never see.
What is?

This is some of the finest filigreed platinum I've ever seen. But the stones, no. They're not diamonds, Mrs. Langtry.
This is some of the finest filigreed platinum I've ever seen. But the stones, no. They're not diamonds, Mrs. Langtry.
But they must be! They cut glass!
But they must be! They cut glass!
Glass will cut glass, Mrs. Langtry. Do you know where it was purchased?
It was a gift. It isn't worth anything at all?
Why, of course it is. I can offer you -- well, five hundred dollars.
All right.
I'll get you a check.
I hope you're not too badly disappointed with us, Mrs. Langtry.
It's not your fault.
It's not your fault.
You'll give us an opportunity to serve you again, I hope. If there's anything you think we might be interested in...
You'll give us an opportunity to serve you again, I hope. If there's anything you think we might be interested in...
I have only one thing now. Are you interested?
I have only one thing now. Are you interested?
Well, I'd have to see it, of course.
Well, I'd have to see it, of course.
You are seeing it. You're looking right at it.
Whadaya say?
Hello.
Kaggs. Home office.
Roy Dillon.
Roy Dillon.
I know that. Knew it when I saw you out there. The best salesman here, which isn't saying much. Want to talk to you, Dillon.
What's up?
That was a pretty backhanded compliment. If I let people get away with things like that, I wouldn't be a good salesman.
That was a pretty backhanded compliment. If I let people get away with things like that, I wouldn't be a good salesman.
You're right. I apologize. But I still want to talk to you.
You're right. I apologize. But I still want to talk to you.
Lead on.
When I said you being the best salesman here didn't say much, I meant for us. I know your record with Sarber and Webb, and I'd say you're a top-flight man, but you've had no incentive. No one walking on your heels. Just a lot of half asses, so the tendency's been not to stretch yourself. I'm bouncing the slobs, incidentally.
So I heard.
So I heard.
Makes no difference to me if they're only on commission. If they don't make good money, they're not giving us good representation, and we can't afford to have them around. Ever supervise salesmen?
Makes no difference to me if they're only on commission. If they don't make good money, they're not giving us good representation, and we can't afford to have them around. Ever supervise salesmen?
Just myself.
Just myself.
That's right, you've had to supervise yourself. This place needs a sales manager. Somebody who's proved he's a salesman and can handle other salesmen. He'd have a lot of deadwood to clear out, new men to hire. What do you think?
Sounds like a good Idea.
I don't know offhand what your best year's been, we can look it up. The idea is, we'll top it by fifteen percent.
What? Me?
That's just the first year. If you aren't worth a lot more than that the second year, I'll kick you out. What do you say?
That's just the first year. If you aren't worth a lot more than that the second year, I'll kick you out. What do you say?
Well, uh... No.
Well, uh... No.
No?
No?
I can't take that job! I mean, I mean, I can't take it right away. I'm still recuperating, I just dropped in to say hello, see everybody --
I can't take that job! I mean, I mean, I can't take it right away. I'm still recuperating, I just dropped in to say hello, see everybody --
I didn't realize. Yeah, you do look a little pale. How soon will you be ready? A week?
I didn't realize. Yeah, you do look a little pale. How soon will you be ready? A week?
But you need a man right now. It wouldn't be fair to you to --
But you need a man right now. It wouldn't be fair to you to --
I take care of the being-fair-to-me department. Things've gone to hell this long, they can go a little longer.
I take care of the being-fair-to-me department. Things've gone to hell this long, they can go a little longer.
Well...
See you in a week, Roy. I can call you Roy?
Oh, sure. Fine.
And I'm Perk. Short for Percy, I'm afraid.
Perk.
Good to have you back, Roy. I was just looking at --
Mr. Kaggs, I'm sorry.
Mr. Kaggs, I'm sorry.
You're turning me down? Makes no sense, Roy.
You're turning me down? Makes no sense, Roy.
I guess I'm just not a leader of men.
I guess I'm just not a leader of men.
Oh, come on, Roy.
Oh, come on, Roy.
The truth is, Mr. Kaggs --
The truth is, Mr. Kaggs --
Perk, remember?
Perk, remember?
Okay, fine. Perk, the truth is, I like things the way they are now. Pick my own hours, have time for, uh, other activities...

A well-rounded life. I respect that. But it has to have a center, Roy, something you care about, something you can think about.

Well, Roy, if that's the way you feel, I won't badger you. Don't want to lose you as a salesman, too.

Oh, I'd like to stay on. Just keep everything the way it was.
Oh, I'd like to stay on. Just keep everything the way it was.
That's what we'll do, then. But I tell you what, Roy. Before I hire anybody else, I'll ask you one last time. Fair enough?

Fair enough.
So what's your story today?
They twisted my arm.
They twisted my arm.
Only one arm?
They knocked out my tooth!
Only one tooth?
Sure I am. What made you turn up, after all these years?
I'm working down in San Diego. Just for a few weeks. Thought I'd drop in on my long-lost son.

Nice to see you. What am I doing in here?
Well... You're all right now, I guess. I have to get down to the track.
Thanks, uh, Lilly.

Don't mention it.

I guess I owe you my life.

You always did.
What happened to your hand?
Just a little accident. I went by your place, picked up your mall. Just bills, I'll take care of them.

Stop kidding me! Four years in a town like Los Ang-gleez, and a peanut selling job is the best you can do? You expect me to believe that?

And that dump you live in! Those clown pictures on the walls!
I like those.
You do not! Roy Dillon? Cornball clown pictures? Commission salesman? It's all a front, isn't it? You're on the grift, I know you are. You're working some angle, and don't tell me you're not because I wrote the book!

How come?
Not as tough as you, huh?
No. And you have to be.
Up to you.
My boss is a guy named Bobo Justus, back in Baltimore. When a long shot gets too much action, I have to put money on that horse at the track, because it's the only way to get the odds down.

Sure.
Sure.
The first day of the Delmar meet, there was a nag called Bluebell. I should have been on it. But that was the day after you came in here, so I stuck around to see how you were gonna be.
That was my choice, nothing to do with you. I took a chance, and it didn't work out.
Bluebell came in?
Bluebell came in?
I sent Bobo ten grand of my own money, like it was the winnings from my bets. I hoped that would cover me. It didn't.
Lucky? You call that lucky?
He let me live. He let me be his friend.
You don't put up with that! Nobody has to put up with that!
You do if you're where I am. Where you want to be. How'd you get that punch in the stomach, Roy?
I tripped over a chair.
Get off the grift, Roy.
Get off the grift, Roy.
Why?
Why?
You don't have the stomach for it.
I just give you your life. What you do with it is up to you.
That's right.
Roy! What are you doing in San Diego?
Myra and me come down to LaJolla for the weekend.
If you come out to the track, don't know me.
We won't hit the track. The beach. Couple a nice restaurants.
What's that?
Four grand. For the hospital. Is that enough?
Four grand. For the hospital. Is that enough?
Roy, I don't want money from you.
Roy, I don't want money from you.
I pay my debts.
I pay my debts.
You do?
Expecting visitors?
No. That was the point.
You ought to put a bandage on that.
No can do. Have to dip in and out of my bag too much. Besides, it'll heal in the air.
I thought... I was hoping we could play it straight with one another.
I guess not. You'll be heading east from here, huh?
I guess not. You'll be heading east from here, huh?
After the meet. Back to Baltimore.
After the meet. Back to Baltimore.
Well... nice to see you again, Lilly.
Well... nice to see you again, Lilly.
You, too, Roy.
Well, sure, Roy. You want me to drive up --? Okay, fine, come on down. It won't be a home-cooked meal, you know.
Well, that's good news.
Going somewhere?
Somewhere else, that's for sure.
Somewhere else, that's for sure.
I just came back from Phoenix.

Bobo won't be. He'll spend the money to make sure.
Even so. You still got time. Relax a minute, tell me what happened. Sit down.
Myra followed you, huh?
She must have been the one that blew me off with Bobo. I guess to get me running. Did you tell her about my stash?
She must have been the one that blew me off with Bobo. I guess to get me running. Did you tell her about my stash?
No.
No.
No, you wouldn't. That's what she was after, though. But why hit on me?
No, you wouldn't. That's what she was after, though. But why hit on me?
I wouldn't go in on a deal with her. She blamed you for it.
I wouldn't go in on a deal with her. She blamed you for it.
As though you do what I say.
As though you do what I say.
That's pretty funny, all right. What happened in Phoenix?
I sat in there with her, I thought, what do I do now? Run and I've got Bobo and the law after me. Stay, and how do I explain?
This way's perfect.
It is, isn't it? And maybe it's a break for me after all. I've been wanting out of the racket for years, and now I'm out. I can make a clean start, and --
You've already made a start. Doesn't look that clean, though.
I'm sorry. I hated to take your money, but --
Don't be sorry. You're not taking it.
I need this, Roy. I can't run without money, and if I can't run I'm dead.
You must have some money.
You must have some money.
Just a few bucks.
Just a few bucks.
And Myra's stuff?

Her credit cards. How far am I gonna get with that?

A job? I've never had a legit job in my life!
A job? I've never had a legit job in my life!
Well, you're gonna start, if you hope to live through this. A square job and a quiet life. You start showing up at the track or the hot spots and Bobo's boys will be all over you.

Not any more. Lilly, listen, I'm giving you good advice. I'm following it myself.

I thought you'd be happy for me. After all, you --
I thought you'd be happy for me. After all, you --
Bobo isn't after you! Bobo's after me, and he's goddamn good! But so am I. I'm a survivor, Roy. I survive.
Bobo isn't after you! Bobo's after me, and he's goddamn good! But so am I. I'm a survivor, Roy. I survive.
I know you do, so that's why --
I know you do, so that's why --
And to survive, my way, I need money. Bobo knows about the stash in the car, so I didn't dare touch it, not if Lilly Dillon's dead. So that leaves this.

No.
You want a drink?
I don't think so. You probably shouldn't either.
I don't think so. You probably shouldn't either.
No, but I'm goddamn thirsty. Ice water?
No, but I'm goddamn thirsty. Ice water?
Yeah, sure, that sounds nice.
Yeah, sure, that sounds nice.
I'll get it.
You don't know what I'd do, Roy. You have no idea. To live.
Oh, you'll live, Lilly.
I know what's bugging you, of course.
Oh? I didn't know anything was.
Oh? I didn't know anything was.
Oh, really? You've got a legitimate complaint, Roy, I don't deny that. I wasn't a very good mother when you were a kid.
Oh, really? You've got a legitimate complaint, Roy, I don't deny that. I wasn't a very good mother when you were a kid.
Not very good!
A bad mother. By any standards. I've thought about it, you know, from your side, since then. I know just how bad I was.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
I wonder did you ever think about it from my side.
I wonder did you ever think about it from my side.
Never.
Never.
No, I guess not. It was pretty lousy of me, I guess, to be a child at the same time you were. Not to stop being a child just because I had a child. I guess I was a real stinker not to be a grown-up when you needed a grown-up.
What do you want me to do? Pin a halo on you? You're doing a pretty good job of that yourself.
And making you feel bad at the same time, huh? But that's the way I am, you know, the way I've always been. Always picking on poor little Roy.
And making you feel bad at the same time, huh? But that's the way I am, you know, the way I've always been. Always picking on poor little Roy.
For God's sake, Lilly!

I gave you your life twice. I'm asking you to give me mine once. I need the money.
I gave you your life twice. I'm asking you to give me mine once. I need the money.
No.

That's right.

That's good. You don't really belong on this side of the fence, you know.
That's good. You don't really belong on this side of the fence, you know.
I don't?

If you stayed a crook, do you think you'd live to be my ripe age?
If you stayed a crook, do you think you'd live to be my ripe age?
I don't see why not.
I don't see why not.
Well, I guess I got it wrong, then. Seems to me I heard about a guy just your age that got hit so hard in the guts it almost killed him.
Well, uh...
Sure, sure, that doesn't count. That's different.
Sure, sure, that doesn't count. That's different.
Well, it doesn't matter, does it? I'm getting out.
Well, it doesn't matter, does it? I'm getting out.
And that's why you've got to get rid of this money. If you keep it around, it'll just make you think how clever you are. It'll be a temptation to get back into the game.
And that's why you've got to get rid of this money. If you keep it around, it'll just make you think how clever you are. It'll be a temptation to get back into the game.
Oh, that's it! You're stealing my money for my own good! How very motherly of you, Lilly.
If I should get out of the racket, that goes double for you. That's why you've got to change your life completely, go to some town, get a square job, live like a john yourself. If you try to do it your way, what future is in it?
A future. The only future I've got.
A future. The only future I've got.
That money wouldn't last forever. And then what? You'd be back in some other part of the rackets. Another Bobo Justus to slap you around and burn holes in your hands. This way, you've got to go the square route. You could send me a card when you're settled, I could maybe help out sometimes...

Roy... What if I told you I wasn't really your mother? That we weren't related?

There's nothing more to talk about.
I have to have that money, Roy. What do I have to do to get it?
Lilly, Jesus, what are you doing?
Is there nothing I can do, Roy, nothing at --
Is there nothing I can do, Roy, nothing at --
NO!
You heard the shower, didn't you?
I don't care about that. This time, I gotta have the rent.
Joe, I thought I was gonna be all right by now, I just need a little more --
It isn't the owner, Myra, it's my wife. She knows what's going on. This time, I gotta have the money.
It isn't the owner, Myra, it's my wife. She knows what's going on. This time, I gotta have the money.

Well, well. In a real hurry, are we?
Always, for you, baby.
You aren't taking me for granted, are you?
Taking you for granite?
That isn't granite. If that fell on me, it wouldn't hurt at all.
Are you sure?

No more than this?
What are you talking abut, Myra? Marriage?
I didn't say that. You aren't marriage material.
Ow! Hey, what are you trying to do, throw me off my game?
No, baby. Come to Mama.
You were bleeding inside, honey. Remember that bruise you had?
You called the doctor, huh?
You called the doctor, huh?
Well, no, Roy. Your mother found you.

Her job.
I want to know everything about you.
I want to know everything about you.
You do. And once I'm out of here, I'll remind you of the best parts.
I don't see why you're still here. You look healthy to me.
I just do what the doctor says, babe.

And when he got serious?
And when he got serious?
He'd explain he had to have cash, so there wouldn't be any paper trail for the SEC. And a lot of cash, or it wasn't worth while. The least we ever took was forty thousand, and the most was one hundred eighty-five thousand dollars! From one sucker!

You mean, it would be too tough to give me a turndown here. Easier on home grounds.
Yes or no. They're both easier at home. Okay?

A hit, you mean. Honestly, it doesn't have that feel to it, but I'll certainly consider the possibility. Thank you for telling me.

I like a woman who takes control.
One set of muddy shoe prints.
That don't match either of the victim's.
Where, judging by the looks of the finger and palm prints, she struggles to open the window before banging on it like hell.
Unable to escape, she turns and attacks the killer, but doesn't connect.

No blood on the knife.
The killer knocks the knife out of her hand with the wrought-iron poker.
Broken blood vessels on her right forearm.
As which point she drops to her knees in pain...
Explaining the low height of the blood splatter on the curtains...
Impressive, Blake. Where'd you learn how to do that?

So they're trying to kill you and your baby. Don't tell me. Your name also happens to be Rosemary.
No, please listen! They're coming ... coming for me and my baby.
No, please listen! They're coming ... coming for me and my baby.

She wasn't here when I brought Danny home from --
Danny, go downstairs -- Now!
My, God! What have you done to him?
I didn't -- He got in a fight and I --
I didn't -- He got in a fight and I --
You stay away from him!
Do you know how insane this is? Who am I supposed to be looking for?
Him.
God, what's wrong with him?
Here. Let me try.
Kyle's mother might be dead for all I know. Now I'm afraid he could be next.
Why would anyone want to kill an innocent baby?
Why would anyone want to kill an innocent baby?
Not just Kyle. All of you. His entire family. Here. Look at this.
It was there when I found him this morning. It looks like some kind of letter or number or --
It's a rune ... Thorn.
Runes were a kind of early alphabet that originated in Northern Europe thousands of years ago. They were symbols -- carved out of stone or pieces of wood. Of all the runes, Thorn had the most negative influence. Cults used them in blood rituals to portend future events and invoke magic.
Black magic ... 'In ancient times, Thorn was believed to cause sickness, famine and death. Translated literally, it was the name of a demon spirit that delivered human sacrifices ... on the Celtic celebration of Samhain.'

Halloween.
Halloween.
'When applied directly to another person, Thorn could be used to call upon them confusion and destruction -- to literally visit them with the Devil.'
Where are you going?
To find the rest of your family before Michael Myers does -- or whoever's been controlling him.
Danny?! Danny!
Mrs. Blankenship, have you seen the little boy who came in with me and --
Where's the baby?!
He's gone.
Danny! Danny, where are you?!
Kara, no!
What now?!
Wait a minute ...
Come on!
It's not working!
Christ, what a night! Not even so much as a sign for five miles on that road!
That's the whole idea of living in the country. I thrive on the seclusion.
Unlike you, Sam, I learned many years ago not to second-guess the motives of my fellow man. Remember what Freud said: 'Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.' Or, in this case, a drink is just a drink.
I hope you didn't come all the way out here in this storm just to quote Freud.

You're the only man for the job, Sam. Things haven't been the same since you left. I'm recruiting the best psychiatric team in the country. Old colleagues. This is your change to finally make a difference.
But with Rogers and his house of hacks gone, you'd make the rules. Just think it over.
Please try to understand, Terence. I've already made up my mind.
It was her voice. On the radio. It was Jamie. Calling for me.
You don't know that for sure. It could have been anyone. A practical joke. Kids.

That's what someone wants us to believe, but I tell you Michael is alive. I feel him. I sense the evil that lives inside, just as I did all those years as I watched him. Sitting behind these very same walls. Staring. Growing stronger. As my colleague, as my friend, please. I can't go through this again. Not alone. I need your help to
Notify Haddonfield's sheriff; tell him we're on our way. I want the entire staff on alert. We go to code red lockdown for twenty-four hours. If he is alive, I plan on bringing him back.
Or what's left of him.
What is that?
It's a sign. He's come home.
Sam, don't -- let them take care of her.
I'm here now, Jamie. You're going to live. You have to.
There you are. Who was that boy?
An old friend.
There's more people moving eastbound down Old Reservoir Road past the elementary school.
Any word on the location of the Strodes?

Good. I want around-the-clock surveillance on that house.
What's wrong? What's happened to Jamie?
I'll meet you over there.
Where's the child?
Sam, you know you never fail to amaze me. Yesterday happily retired, today right back in the thick of things. Somehow I knew you still had it in you.
Come now, Sam. This is a gathering of old friends. I know how difficult this must be for you -- a man of your upbringing and integrity -- but now that I'm in charge I felt it was only fair that you finally know the truth. After all, you're the only one around here who's still in the dark, as it were. This isn't

Your madness is another man's greatness. This is the way things have always been. You've just been too blinded by your own reality to see.

Why did you take Jamie?

She has the gift -- the blood of Thorn running through her veins. Michael's mother had it, too. So for six years I incubated her, prepared her for this night. Michael has served his purpose. And soon we will have a new progeny.

There you go trying to make sense again. It's a curse. Handed down through countless generations. As ageless as this celebration which you call Halloween.

Samhain.
Samhain.
And I'm its deliverer. Its calling card, if you will. I follow it. Protect it. Act as its guardian. In a sense, Sam, so do you.
You've created a monster.
Amazing, isn't it? I even taught him to drive.
No!!!
Stay away, Sam.

Leave the boy. Take me.

Yes ... Tommy. What are you doing here?
Please -- just tell me the truth. Has Michael Myers come home?
What do you know about Michael?
I know he's alive. People in this town -- they want us to believe he's dead. But I know. I've always known.

No one.
No -- there had to be someone else. Who knew?!
