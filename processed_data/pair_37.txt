No, Carter. The reason I'm screwed is because the entire department is about to find out the stolen credit cards we impounded were used to buy two first class upgrades to Hong Kong. And what the hell is Heaven on Earth?

Everyone else at the table has thousand dollar chips, but the black man gets the nickel, is that it? Did my people survive two-hundred years of slavery so you could send us back to the cotton fields with five-hundred dollar chips? Do I look like Chicken George to you?

One of my regulars lost fifty thousand dollars at the table here last week. I was about to send my boys down to tune his ass up, when the guy comes in and pays off the whole thing. Including the vig -- brand new sequential hundred dollar bills. I knew something was wrong. Cause this guy's got a regular job, no way he comes
I knew it. The guy's name is Zing. He works at the kitchen at Reign Plaza.
All right, Kenny. Thanks. You're off the hook. For now.

They think I'm a crooked customs agent.
It's a myth. Some kind of counterfeit.
It's much more than a counterfeit. 14 out of 15 world banks can't tell the difference. The paper is Crane linen blend -- and the bills are printed on U.S. Intaglio presses.

In 1959, the United States was very friendly with the Shah of Iran. We wanted his oil, so for the Shah's birthday, the government gave him a gift -- a U.S. Treasury Intaglio press. The only one to ever leave the country. Five years ago Ricky Tan bought that press on the black market.
They use an optical transfer ink from India that burns red -- the real ink burns black.

Lee. I just got an idea how someone could launder a hundred million dollars in cash.
Red Dragon.
That was the name of Ricky Tan's boat.
Let's go.
Wait a second. We can't go in like this. Look at this place, we gotta look fly. We gotta Mac out.

No. I'm going to find out.
No. I'm going to find out.
Wait a second. There's guards all over the place. You'll need a distraction.
I'll go to the craps table, make a big scene. When security comes over, you make your move.
Try to keep them busy for five minutes.

We have to get to the Penthouse.
You go after Ricky. I got this.

Just GO!
Lee, wait a second. It's not worth it, man. He's making you do this.
It's worth it to me.
We made it, man.
No problem.
I saw that. She kissed you, didn't she? You played it cool, though. Walking away, never looking back.
She's going home to New York. I need some ice.

Quite a night, Inspector. Ricky Tan was our only bait, and now he's gone. You finally got your revenge - at the expense of a U.S. Government investigation.
What "revenge" is he talking about?
What "revenge" is he talking about?
I don't know if the Fu-Cang-Long paid you to get rid of Tan, or whether it was a pure vendetta killing -- but you're off this case. I don't ever want to see you again, you got that?

Fine with me.
I know who you are, Inspector Lee.
Then you know I'm not walking away from this case.
Is this a payoff?
No. It's a sample. You guys ever heard of the Superbill?
It wasn't hard to spot the fakes until this past year. Then Tan got hold of one of a kind Swiss made hundred dollar plates -- and started making superbills.
And Hu Li killed him for the plates.
And Hu Li killed him for the plates.
Yes. They've printed and shipped one hundred million dollars, and there's only one way to spot a fake.
Put your arms around me.
Excuse me?
What's going on?

Why don't you go get them?

If I'm wrong then my cover is blown.
The Secret Service almost busted Reign at his casino in Macao, but the place burned down before we could move in.
How do I know I can trust you?
How do I know I can trust you?
Dip me!
I'm asking for real now -- will you help the Secret Service?
No. But I'll help you.
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
I didn't know which side you were on.
Now you know.

Lee, there was a bombing at the American Embassy. Two American translators were killed.
Any leads?

We think it's Ricky Tan. If you don't want to take the case, I'll understand.

It's my responsibility.
Lee, this is Special Agent Sterling from the United States Secret Service.
The Secret Service? Why?
All he wanted was some mu-shu.
Are you okay, Lee?
Lee, we just got a call from the harbor patrol. Ricky Tan is throwing a little party on his boat tonight. Victoria harbor. If you don't want to...
Did you tell Sterling?
Did you tell Sterling?
Let him find out on his own. I want the Hong Kong police handling this.

Escort Detective Carter to the airport --
I'll take him.
Lee, I've missed you, brother. I heard about the two Americans, I'm so sorry, you must be under great pressure.
You must come with me for questioning.
Despite what people suspect...what you suspect --
Don't.
... if your father were alive, I would be turning to him now. I didn't blow up the American Embassy, but I believe some of my people did. My enemies are trying to frame me. There is a war going on within the Triads -- and I am going to lose. My name has been written into the book of death.
The police can protect you.

Nobody can protect me. I'll make a deal with you, Lee. But only iff you'll get me out of Hong Kong.

There is a ship, in the Hong Kong Harbor...
You're just like your father, Lee. All these years hiding behind his badge. I wanted to help him, to share with him, but he was too afraid of change. When you think about it, I didn't really kill him. I just put him out of his misery.
Put the plates down. It's over.
Put the plates down. It's over.
I don't think it's over. There are casinos all over this country. Let me make you a rich man, Lee. Don't make the same mistake he did.
If you reach for that gun, I'm going to kill you.
Don't you remember? I'm already dead.
Didn't I teach you to always arch your back?
Yes, Master.
I need your help, Master. I'm seeking a man who used to train with you. He's become a killer - the worst kind of animal.
Animals kill only from hunger or fear. The man you seek is lower than a serpent. ...he kills for money.
He was the best I ever trained, you know.
Ricky Tan?
Ricky Tan?
No. Your father. Your father and Ricky Tan were my favorite students... and for such awful things to happen as they did --

You don't move, you understand?! You don't move!
Do I look like I'm movin'?! What you're seeing here? This is not movement. This is my "still".
You know what a phone booth is?!
The bomb was meant as a demonstration of our sincerity. If you want the Ambassador's daughter back alive, listen and do not talk.

The Ambassador will receive instructions for the drop, half an hour before it is to be made. If it is successful, there will be more. Thank you, Agent Carter.

Feds asked for me?
They asked for the best street man I had.
And that, of course, would be me.
Don't push it. You better watch your ass with these Fed types. If there's a screw-up, they won't think twice about burnin' it.
Ooo, there's a chill. Love that.

Be sorry for Soon Young. She has no chance now.
What are you doing here?
Well, I ain't goin' to China. And neither are you.
Oh no.
What?
What?
The art.
No, it is China, my country, my history. If any of it gets damaged...
Hey, don't worry. Nothing's gonna happen to it.
Oh my god. Griffin.
You know him?
What a surprise!
FBI calls up my ass, says they need help in Tokyo. Like I'm supposed to drop everything.

It's Hong Kong, not Tokyo. My country asked for the best. I told them that was you. Now I will show you around my hood.

No shark fin, no camel hump. What you listenin' to?
No shark fin, no camel hump. What you listenin' to?
Oh, I think you like this very much.
Yeah...beautiful. What would you call that paper there? Kind of a...Robin egg blue color?
Good. That's standard military packaging for plastique. Get a look under it.
Not anymore.
Where'd you get it?
You're killin' me here.
Carter, just because you saved my butt, doesn't mean it's yours.
Carter, just because you saved my butt, doesn't mean it's yours.
Oh, baby, you cruel...
Last night's as much my fault as yours. If he's gonna put the blame on anybody --
Hey, I was senior. It's OK. This is why I get the big bucks.
Hey, baby, it's cool. Captain just reassigned me to the Feds.
The Feds?!
The Feds?!
FBI needs a taste of the street. And I'm it.
Way he put it, I was the only one he thought could handle it. But you know what the worst thing is?
No...what?
No...what?
I could get promoted right out of here.
I could get promoted right out of here.
What's wrong with that?
What's wrong with that?
I wouldn't be close to you. What is that perfume, girl?
How'd what go?
With the FBI. What do you think I'm talking about?
Oh, you're not gonna believe what they put me in charge of. They sent for the Ambassador's personal Chinese Investigator type. He is like the baddest Asian shield they got. And I, let me repeat that, I am the man who is on the case with him. Just the two of us, alone, workin' the whole deal as a team.
They put you in charge?
They put you in charge?
In Charge. Just me'n him. No interference. They don't even want to hear from us until we're done. I love the F.B.I. I love the F.B.I.
In Charge. Just me'n him. No interference. They don't even want to hear from us until we're done. I love the F.B.I. I love the F.B.I.
Well...listen, if you need any help, you know, back up, call me, OK?
Well...listen, if you need any help, you know, back up, call me, OK?
Oh baby, don't worry, I'll call you. You can count on it.
Oh baby, don't worry, I'll call you. You can count on it.
OK. Well...make us proud. And be careful.
Well.. I wouldn't want to be in the way.
No way in the way! I'm talkin' back up, Johnson. I'm in charge! And I need you, baby.
You got a lot of guts calling me.
Yes I do. That's all I got. Guts and you, Johnson. There's no one else I can trust.
Yes I do. That's all I got. Guts and you, Johnson. There's no one else I can trust.
You made a fool out of me! In front of the FBI!
You made a fool out of me! In front of the FBI!
Listen, this ain't about us! It's about a thirteen year old girl. She's not gonna make it. Unless we do something.
Jesus...what do you want?
This whole thing is goin' down tonight. I need to know where the Ambassador is gonna be. The Feds will be keepin' a lid on everything. You thing you can do that?

This is my city. I'm a cop. I'll find em.

Alright, Johnson, thank you. So...what are you wearing?
Oh my god...what happened to you?
It's called a dress.
It's called a dress.
It's called you're gonna kill me. What're you doin' with that on?
Wait a minute. I'm not riding in that.
What?! This is a class ride, Johnson.
What?! This is a class ride, Johnson.
Yeah, if you're Superfly.
Yeah, if you're Superfly.
That's it! You can attack me, but when you attack my car, I cannot forgive! You in the back, girl!
You don't like it?
It's okay. For restaurants.
You OK?
We saved the girl and got the bad guys, didn't we?
We saved the girl and got the bad guys, didn't we?
Yeah. So why you look do down?
Yeah. So why you look do down?
Look at me! My dress is ruined. I look like shit.
Look at me! My dress is ruined. I look like shit.
Not to me. Never to me.
How about a lift home?
Absolutely. I'll even let you ride in the front seat.
Any demands yet?
At this point we don't have much.
At this point we don't have much.
How much they want?

You come highly recommended, Carter. And your particular assignment requires a special talent.
You come highly recommended, Carter. And your particular assignment requires a special talent.
Interrogation is one a my specialties, but undercover work is my forte.
... the director considers this top priority, considering he is a Chinese National and here under difficult circumstances. His name is Lee. And he is to be shown every courtesy. Within reason.
Sir, he's just gonna get in my way. If I'm gonna handle this situation...
Sir, he's just gonna get in my way. If I'm gonna handle this situation...
He is the situation.
I'm talking about the girl.
Don't worry about the kidnapping, Carter, the F.B.I. will handle that. Your assignment is Lee.
What kind of assignment is that?
Bottom line: I don't want some Chung King Cop getting his head blown off and turning this operation into a international incident.

Why don't you assign one of your own men to this?

What the hell am I supposed to do with him? Take him to the zoo?
What the hell am I supposed to do with him? Take him to the zoo?
Just make him think you're following leads. Interview some suspects, look at fingerprints, do detective shit. I don't care. I just don't want to see him- or you, for that matter- until this is resolved. Now, we want to make a good impression, don't we? His plane lands in an hour. Don't be late.
What do you mean you lost him?! How could you lose him?!
Try a bus load of - no, make that two bus loads of Chinese --
You understand what I'm sayin'?
Carter, shut up!
Yo, Johnson...
You think this is funny, Carter? You send for someone from Explosives!? Four men just died in there!

Hey, man, you can use her. She's an expert!

Hmmmm?
Don't play bullshit games with me.
Don't play bullshit games with me.
Eleven thirty tomorrow the Ambassador will receive a phone call telling him where the drop is. He said the bomb was a demonstration of their sincerity.
Oh yeah. The caller was a man. Confident. Had an accent. My guess, Asian. Anything else I can do for the FBI, sir?
Why don't you try the assignment. Or should I call and ask for somebody who can handle it?
Why don't you try the assignment. Or should I call and ask for somebody who can handle it?
No, sir. I'm as good as it gets.
Okay, let me start from the top. A few days ago I was on this munitions dealer named Lafontaine. Now, after the shit blew up last night...
I'm not interested, Carter. You're no longer on this assignment.
I'm not interested, Carter. You're no longer on this assignment.
What?!
What?!
And your buddy, Mr. Lee, is on his way back to China. Now, get out. Before I file obstruction of justice charges against you.
Hey, hey, you start touching me there, I'm gonna start movin'! Word up, mother...
Shut up!
Shut up!
You a cop or something?
You a cop or something?
Or somethin'.
This is not a good way to start a relationship, stickin' a gun to a man's head, feelin' around his personal equipment. Make him think you don't trust him.
I don't trust anybody. Especially first time deals.
I don't trust anybody. Especially first time deals.
I oughta pat your ass down. Make sure you're not a cop.
I oughta pat your ass down. Make sure you're not a cop.
Nobody touches me.
Nobody touches me.
Shit, I ain't interested in puttin' my hands on you. That does nothin' for me. No. I don't need to be pattin' no ass. All I'm sayin' is, how do I know you're not a cop?
You know something? Every time I see this stuff, it reminds me of...uh...a double latte grande... With two shots of non-fat milk.
What are you talking about?
What's this little green wire coming out one side of the package?
I wouldn't touch that if I were you.
Okay, look, we're gonna make a trade. You cross the street, leave her on the sidewalk. I will leave him on this side. Then we trade places. You get him, I get her. Get the picture, Lois?
Do it!
You got a boy friend in here yet? Cause you're gonna need somebody to kiss your ass goodbye.
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
You're movin' to death row. See, your fingerprints are now on the murder weapon of Four FBI Agents. And when I turn this into the lab, they're gonna find Lafontaine all over it. And we already know... ...this is your MO.

How did I do this?! Maybe you didn't notice but I'm in jail!
How did I do this?! Maybe you didn't notice but I'm in jail!
All I gotta do is implicate. The Feds can do a lot with a good implication. Even if you don't get Sparky, I'll bet you get ten to twenty more. Plenty of time to find a nice fella.
You sonuvabitch.
I'm waitin' here for a name.
Where do we find him?
You don't. He finds you. Through his people.
Hello.
Ambassador Han.
Ambassador Han.
Yes.
Yes.
Even if you deny the FBI is there, I will assume you are lying.
My daughter.
She's fine.
She's fine.
Can I speak with her?
Yes.
You have run out of time. The amount now is two hundred million. I will call later with instructions. You will either deliver the money or pick up the body of your daughter.

Please, you must understand, what happened today was not --
Hello.
Take the money with you tonight. Pack it in six dragons. You will be contacted again.

I want to speak with my daughter!

Han?

Yes.
Yes.
It's Griffin.
It's Griffin.
Griffin? Where are you.
Yes.
You have what I asked for?
You have what I asked for?
I do.
I do.
Pack it into black garbage bags. Throw the bags into a garbage dump in the alley behind the Fang Shan Restaurant in China Town. You have twenty-nine minutes left.
I would like one of my people to help.
Ambassador, let me assure you that the FBI has made this a top priority. We have plenty of manpower on the case.
Ambassador, let me assure you that the FBI has made this a top priority. We have plenty of manpower on the case.
He is very good.
He is very good.
As I said, sir, we've got all the people we need.
I am not an American, Mr. Russ. My daughter is not an American.
I understand, sir. But you are an honored guest of the United States...
I understand, sir. But you are an honored guest of the United States...
He is already on the plane. I hope you will treat him with the same respect you have shown me.
Come on. Let's get you some dry clothes.
Carter, can I have a moment?
I am so sorry about your men.
Yes sir, me too. The State Department has authorized release of the funds. We'll have to make the first drop at 7. As soon as they pick up the money, we've got em.
Yes sir, me too. The State Department has authorized release of the funds. We'll have to make the first drop at 7. As soon as they pick up the money, we've got em.
And Mr. Lee? Where is he?
And Mr. Lee? Where is he?
Don't worry, he's with Carter.
When were you going to tell me you were not going with us?
I still have work to do here.
I still have work to do here.
I don't believe you. My father was explaining to Mr. Griffin. That is how I found out.
I don't believe you. My father was explaining to Mr. Griffin. That is how I found out.
I was trying to find the right time.
I was trying to find the right time.
After I left?
I will not have friends in America.
Soon Young, don't worry. You will have many friends very soon. You will see. America is a very friendly place.
What is he up to now?
Ike just came by to check out the team.
Bob -- are you making friends with this man?
I'm just bragging about how great you are. I'm the luckiest man alive.
At the wedding? You invite him? Bob, don't you realize he's writing another article about me?
Sure I do. But the bet defense is a good offense, right? You're not going to let your opponent throw you off your game.
Sure I do. But the bet defense is a good offense, right? You're not going to let your opponent throw you off your game.
You don't understand this guy.
You don't understand this guy.
Let him come to the wedding. You're not running, right? Say it. "I'm not..."
Let him come to the wedding. You're not running, right? Say it. "I'm not..."
I'm not running.
I'm not running.
So if you're not running and Ike Graham is there to see it, then any article he writes has got to have a happy ending, right? All we're doing is turning lemon into lemonade.

I've got news for you. No amount of sugar and water is going to turn like Graham into something you want to take on a picnic.
Right.
I lead Maggie through a visualization exercise. All the sports shrinks use this head stuff. Visualize the end zone, if you catch my drift.
Yes.
Let me take you back inside, okay?
Ahh.
I'm the town's unofficial fitness trainer. Big advocate of the mind and body combining for success. You could say or you can quote me, I'm a glass half full king of guy.
See you at the wedding.
You bet ya, Coach.
At this pace, it could be an evening wedding.
Hold it! Hold it! I think we're taking this too fast.
What do you expect me to say to this?
How about -- "I hope you'll be very happy together"?
You look awful.
Thank you.
Really?
I didn't want to find out I wasn't for her in the fourth quarter.
I didn't want to find out I wasn't for her in the fourth quarter.
Got any last minute advice?
Got any last minute advice?
Maintain eye contact.
Actually, he only asked me one ridiculous question. The rest weren't so bad.
What? You talked to him! Did you tell him we dated before you were a priest?
What? You talked to him! Did you tell him we dated before you were a priest?
Yes, yes, I'm sure I only did you good, Maggie.
Yes, yes, I'm sure I only did you good, Maggie.
What did he ask?
Only respectful things. What did we have in common back then... What kind of music did you like... Did you ruin my life when you left me standing at the altar...
And what did you say?
And what did you say?
How could I be angry at you when clearly what has happened to me is as God intended?
How could I be angry at you when clearly what has happened to me is as God intended?
Good one! Thanks.
Good one! Thanks.
It happens to be how I feel.
God... Of course. I'm sorry -- I mean, I'm... Brian -- I've got to go. The man's a lunatic, but I know exactly where he's going next.
God bless you, Maggie.
He wanted to know how you used to like your eggs.
Weird. Like after all those years you would remem--
I'm really sorry that I hurt you, Brian.
I'm happy here, where I'm supposed to be. But if you ever become a Catholic, may I ask you a favor, Maggie?
I'm happy here, where I'm supposed to be. But if you ever become a Catholic, may I ask you a favor, Maggie?
Of course.
Of course.
Could your confess to Father Patrick from now on?
Could your confess to Father Patrick from now on?
Of course.
That's it. Back to obedience school.
Okay -- have a seat... gently, carefully.
And in a "V".
Eight is good... "V" could be Victory.
We do it to our dog.
It's hurting.
It's hurting.
We'll rub.
I'll get the dress.
He's here!... He's here!
Tell me, why does Maggie need another wedding rehearsal and two days before the wedding? She's already done this.
Bob is making her visualize the ceremony.
Bob's in a hurry.
Don't be nervous, Maggie. Let us visualize. Remember what Bob said? "Be the ball."
Don't be nervous, Maggie. Let us visualize. Remember what Bob said? "Be the ball."
"Sink the putt."

"Make the shot."

"Nothing but net."

"Never say die."
I love his eyes. I just believe they're listening to you.
His hair... any color.
Rub your ears.
Yes, rubbing your ears is very soothing. Cory does that to me when I hyperventilate.
Fully. I like her. She has wit.
I left four messages. You don't return my calls.
I left four messages. You don't return my calls.
So? I never returned your calls, even when we were married. And what's Fisher doing here anyway?
-- It's for you, Ike.
What?
What?
Journalism lesson number one. If you fabricate your facts, you get fired.
Lesson number two. Never work for your former spouse.
That's not nothing to do with it. You cooked this story up and you know it.
That's not nothing to do with it. You cooked this story up and you know it.
I didn't cook up a story. I had a source.
I didn't cook up a story. I had a source.
Someone reliable, I'm sure. A booze- hound in a bar?
No, that's what makes you unemployed.
I merely write the stuff. You're the one that serves it up.
Lawyers. I don't know, Ellie -- Firing me is going to be very tough on you. It's going to be hard to get over. There will be therapy bills for you.
I already made an appointment for later today.
I already made an appointment for later today.
See? You want custody of my job? ... Why not just consider my wrist slapped and call me when you feel I've served my time?
See? You want custody of my job? ... Why not just consider my wrist slapped and call me when you feel I've served my time?
I'm sorry, Ike. This is permanent.
Fisher, let him talk.
But one of those guys -- not one of them -- knew her at all. Each one was convinced that she was perfect for them, but they didn't see her. And she never showed up so they couldn't see her. It's a very symbolic thing happening. She becomes what she thinks they wanted to be.
Is that what I did to you? Is that what happened? Did I just not see you?
No. No, you didn't.
Well -- I'm sorry, I'm really sorry, Ellie.
I'm sorry, too. Wow. That only took us between years to say.
Maggie!
Where do you think she's going?
Overpriced nice apartment and Chinese takeout. That's New York living.
... Just call me when you have it. Ike, how is the story coming? Is she a man-eater?
... Just call me when you have it. Ike, how is the story coming? Is she a man-eater?
Or a vegetarian?
Or a vegetarian?
Or does she pick "NGB'S" -- "Nice Guys, But..." Nice guys, but I'm cheap. Nice guys, but he lives with his mom... Nice guys, but he just out of prison.
Look, he's running after her.
Look, he's in pretty good shape.
Look, he's in pretty good shape.
Poor Ike.
Ellie asked me to come down to offer moral support.
Since when does Ellie need moral supp--
In vino veritas.
Don't knock drunk guys in bars. Drunk guys in bars are good. It means they're not driving.
Ike, I really liked the Runaway Bride piece, and since I do freelance stuff for G.Q., I'm in a different position now...
What are you trying to say to me, Fish?
Vindication. How would you like to get some? A chance to prove that, though your facts weren't entirely straight, your theory was correct.
The real story on Miss Carpenter.
The real story on Miss Carpenter.
All the gory details.
The anatomy of the black widow spider of Maryland.
It wouldn't be a bad way to get you back into writing feature pieces again.
It wouldn't be a bad way to get you back into writing feature pieces again.
This is good. It is a good story, Fish.
If she runs, then it's a cover story. All true. All accurate.
Okay, you were right. I hated my column, but I can do this assignment.
Okay, you were right. I hated my column, but I can do this assignment.
Then you've got it. If you leave tomorrow for the hinterlands, you'll have plenty of time before her next wedding trot.

"Paid vindication" That's what I call justice.

Justice, yes. Paid, I don't know. They like the idea, but my hands are tied with budget restraints.
Justice, yes. Paid, I don't know. They like the idea, but my hands are tied with budget restraints.
But I'll get my normal fee, right?
Don't say "spec" like it's a dirty word. Nobody ever paid Shakespeare to write a play! Plato never got a book advance...
Oh yeah! I happen to know from reliable sources that Nietzche got expenses and a rental car.
Yes, well, my theory was that she may be running because she gets attention... Negative attention is attention. Like when women whack you on the street because of your column, that's negative attention.
This is about her negative attention, not mine. Did you get the reimbursement for the dress yet?
This is about her negative attention, not mine. Did you get the reimbursement for the dress yet?
No, I'm paying for the dress. Do you think she's still gonna run?
No, I'm paying for the dress. Do you think she's still gonna run?
I don't know.
Look -- I'll be in there later today. I'll come by and tell you all about it.
You're coming here?
You're coming here?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Then come for dinner.
Then come for dinner.
Okay, we'll order out.
Okay, we'll order out.
Order out like a Philistine, when you got the Galloping Gourmet here?...
No... They're interesting guys. Each one of these guys has something going for him. I mean, one's been up Everest. Another's become a priest. One's a pretty good guitar player. And this guy today tried to end world hunger, if you can believe that...
Whoa, Ike. Getting a complex, buddy?
Of course we are. Of course.
Then you'll be my best man.
Then you'll be my best man.
Well, I'm good, I don't know if I'm best.
Well, I'm good, I don't know if I'm best.
Go talk to the pastor and he'll tell you what to do. And someone will tell me what to do.
I have no idea what I'm doing.
Your job is... the ring. Do you have the ring?!
Your job is... the ring. Do you have the ring?!
I just found out I'm best man! I'm lucky I have a suit... What's wrong?
Get this man a Kamikaze.
Splendid dissection of Maggie Carpenter, very professional job.
You could have told me you were fiance number three.
And end up in the papers? I've been humiliated enough already to last a lifetime, thank you. I'm sorry she got you canned.
And end up in the papers? I've been humiliated enough already to last a lifetime, thank you. I'm sorry she got you canned.

She's a cacophony of contradictions.

Not bad. I was traveling around studying the reproductive and migratory patterns of locusts when Maggie met me.

Neuter a locust, feed the world.
Same as you said. What did you call her? A "man-eater", "a devouring death goddess."
I don't think that's why she ran.
I don't think that's why she ran.
Why do YOU think she ran?
I don't know. I'm working on it. I was on the wrong track.
And you defending her?

No. I call it like I see it. I'm a journalist. I'm a truth teller.
No. I call it like I see it. I'm a journalist. I'm a truth teller.
Unbelievable, she got to you.
Unbelievable, she got to you.
Oh, please!
Sorry, no. I just got one.
Excuse me, sir. I have an actual fact for you.
Excuse me, sir. I have an actual fact for you.
Yes, Mrs. Pressman.
Yes, Mrs. Pressman.
It's her fourth time to the altar, you know. Not seven like they said.
It's her fourth time to the altar, you know. Not seven like they said.
I know. Tell me something. Do you think she's going to make it all the way this time?
I'm not sure. Mr. Schullian runs the newsstand, he's our local bookie, you know, he's giving eight to one odds she won't. He says she's so famous now, maybe Vegas will give odds on her. I'm going to wait to hear what the pros say.
Good fact. Well, you let me know.
Good fact. Well, you let me know.
Oh, I will.
Well, I'm off. A reporter's work is never done. Mrs. Pressman, thank you.
Tootaloo.
It's okay. There's no microphone. You're no fun.
No, I'm not.
Hello. I'm looking for Maggie Carpenter. There was a sign at the hardware store across the street...
Are you a reporter?
What?
It's been our experience that anyone with some sort of gewgaw on his loafers ends up being another big city reporter wanting to interview Maggie.

About her upcoming wedding and all.

No, about her getting that asshole from New York fired.
I am just such a reporter. And you are?
Peggy Phleming. Not the ice skater.
And you are?
Looking for Maggie.
Looking for Maggie.
Yep. Maggie -- Someone to see you.
I think you'd look good in red.
No, she's talking about your hair.
Have you listened to his morning show, "Wake up with ballplayer"?
Not yet. I had a phlemless morning. I hear he's a pretty good ballplayer.
Not yet. I had a phlemless morning. I hear he's a pretty good ballplayer.
This game is pretty important to him. He made all-stars in high school, you know.
This game is pretty important to him. He made all-stars in high school, you know.
That must have made you proud.
It's nice that they're still friends.
Oh, sure. That was a long time ago. See, she's not a man-hater at all. She's very supportive of men...
Yes, I am. And who are you?

-- The luau for Maggie.
Your two cinnamon rolls.
Bye, Betty. Thanks.
You should thank Lou and I for the wedding car -- a '63 Buick.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Oh, come on. You're practically family.
They made me put my hat back on.
Oh, yeah. Scared the hell out of Skipper.
Gee, I hope they don't have a fight out there. You don't think they'll call it off...?
Well, wedding cake freezes. This we know.
Well, wedding cake freezes. This we know.
You know, your daughter seems...
Like her mother.
Ah, beautiful. I just can't see her leaving multiple grooms in the dust like that.
Dad's fishing trip, Grandma's knee operation, Grandma's birthday...
Gotta tell you this about my daughter. My daughter makes real good time, even in a long dress and heels. Maggie may not be Hale's longest running joke, but she certainly is the fastest.
I hope you have a different angle. It's pretty much all been covered.
Originality is my speciality.
Originality is my speciality.
Excellent.
Well, instead of a haircut, how about a wash? You know, get all that city grit out of it.
You'll answer my questions?
Getting nervous?
Nervous? Not at all! No. I've never been more certain in my life. Except -- I am having all kinds of weird dreams.
Weird dreams? You're going to tell me about them?
Yes.
I'm not here to make you feel bad. I'm here for vindication. In my heart...
You have one?
Did something happen to make you care about reality?
Yes. Conviction. Conviction that I'm onto the truth. You're going to do the same thing to "poor bastard number four" that you did to the last three. You're going to run again. And I'm not leaving until you do.
Yes. Conviction. Conviction that I'm onto the truth. You're going to do the same thing to "poor bastard number four" that you did to the last three. You're going to run again. And I'm not leaving until you do.
You're going to be very disappointed.
You're going to be very disappointed.
We'll see.
We'll see.
I'd love to stay and chat, but I've got to get back to work. I still have my job.
That's fair.
Despite what you think, I don't do it on purpose. And I have no intention of doing it again.
Everest. Is that right?
Twice...
Twice...
Really?
Really?
Without oxygen...
How romantic.
We think so.
We think so.
Nothing like sharing your nuptial bed with two Sherpas and a yak.
Grandma made me the cutest outfit. I can't wait to show it to you.
A pre-wedding luau?
Give me that!
But the most interesting thing here is that I don't see the rose tattoo that I've heard about on your back.
Look, look, man. I think the man is heartbroken.
He is not!
You've been here for three minutes. What did you do to her?
You can turn that finger around.
You misinterpret everything. We've all been friends our whole lives. But that's the types of relationship you wouldn't understand.
Obviously, I'm not the only one who doesn't understand it. The USS Maggie leaves quite a wake... Excuse me.
I take it the desk clerk is one of your many admirers.
How do I do it? I'm not that beautiful.
You're welcome. Your notes made interesting bedtime reading -- if you like trashy fiction. Your observations are distorted, ungrounded an incomplete. You must be very proud.
I'm not a boastful man. What's your point?
My point is that one again, you're getting it all wrong. That won't improve your reputation any, and it's not very flattering to me either. So, I'm going to give you a chance to write the truth.
Really.
My magazine doesn't pay because for stories. It's not what you call ethical.
Oh, but making up the facts as you go along is ethical? Actually, I meant you. You probably got severance or expenses or both. I'll take your check. No credit cards.

You've seen the post-its. I've already got more juicy material than I need. Why should I pay you dollar one?
You've seen the post-its. I've already got more juicy material than I need. Why should I pay you dollar one?
Because I think you're writing on spec and with a first person interview, you might actually sell that thing.
Too much.
Seven-fifty.
Seven-fifty.
Five hundred.
Five hundred.

Six-fifty.
Done.
It's a birthday present for my cousin. Put your finger in.
Cindy the manicurist.
I think so.
I like it. This whole thing is pretty incredible. I think you could probably sell this lamp idea in New York.
I like it. This whole thing is pretty incredible. I think you could probably sell this lamp idea in New York.
Maybe someday.

You afraid to try?

No, I'm not afraid. Just... Maybe someday.
No, I'm not afraid. Just... Maybe someday.
Well, I'm impressed. Absolutely incredible. I didn't expect pink and lacy, but this isn't exactly a woman's room.
Well, I'm impressed. Absolutely incredible. I didn't expect pink and lacy, but this isn't exactly a woman's room.
What an incredible chauvinistic observation.
Always a mood killer.
Still sweet.
It's a little "Silence of the Lambs" for me. I can't believe you waited for the wedding to run.
He's an entomologist! I thought it was very unique.
It was one of the most wonderful moments of my life. Cal Ripken even applauded.
Highly suspect.
Highly suspect.
What do you mean? It was incredibly romantic!
What do you mean? It was incredibly romantic!
Maybe it's just me, but -- if you got to dress it up, it doesn't ring true.
I'm a work in progress.
So? Is that what you said to her?
So? Is that what you said to her?
No. I think I said something eloquent like, "So, uh -- maybe we should, ya know. What do you think?"
No. I think I said something eloquent like, "So, uh -- maybe we should, ya know. What do you think?"
Now that's romantic. A proposal like that and you didn't find eternal bliss? What went wrong?
I don't know.
You don't know.
You don't know.
No.
No.
Maybe you should ask her some time. Ever thought of that?
Even with everything that's happened I've still never been married and I still deserve a beautiful dress.
Agreed.
You look... uh... You look fine.
Fine. The newspaper's upside down. That's better than fine.
Fine. The newspaper's upside down. That's better than fine.
Bob will be very happy.
I'll have the same.
Of course.
Of course.
What was that? I can't order my eggs without sarcasm?
Tell me. When you get to the altar, will you spike the bouquet?
You know, there's no...
Ike... Hi, Grandma.
Gram here was going to give me the skinny on why you run from marital bliss.
Oh, my God -- It's Miles Davis. This is "King of Blue"! This is the original recording. Hard to find in good condition. Where did you find this?
It was in the attic. It was jus sitting there gathering dust.
It was in the attic. It was jus sitting there gathering dust.
It's valuable. Hang onto it.
It's valuable. Hang onto it.
No. You take it.
Hmmm... Figuring out what kind of music I like and then finding me a rare album. You're not trying to soften me up, are you?
No -- I'm cleaning an attic. I wouldn't attempt the impossible.
Watch your leg, Dad. I'm so tired of this.
Why don't you let him sleep it off in the trunk. I'll take you for a ride. Then we'll come back for him. Keep an eye on him.
Your filter's clogged. This takes unleaded.
Can you fix it?
Can you fix it?
First I have to find some tools. I need a half and a nine-six-tenth.

Of what?
Of what?
Wrenches. My dad's gonna love that one.
Kind of isolated.
Yeah. It's kind of nice.
No. But I think attraction is too often mistaken for rightness. Attraction is very misleading. And if it's mutual, it's well, terribly distracting.
Yes it is. And it doesn't mean anything.
Where did you disappear to?
Missed me bad, huh?
I don't know, give me a minute. Are you all right with this?
Excuse me?
Excuse me?
Are you all right with this? You think this is funny?
Are you all right with this? You think this is funny?
Yes.
Yes.
I don't and I don't think you should...
I'm the only goddamn person in there pulling for you.
You humiliated me!
You humiliated me!
No, Maggie, I defended you. Humiliating you is what everyone else is doing. It's the theme of this party.
No, Maggie, I defended you. Humiliating you is what everyone else is doing. It's the theme of this party.
I had it under control. Now they feel sorry for me.

Well, they should. Because they're about to watch you hang yourself again.
It's fun! It's high.

That's called changing your mind.
That's called changing your mind.
No, that's called not having a mind of your own. What are you doing, Maggie? You really want to let that man drag you up Annapuma on your honeymoon? You don't want to climb Annapuma.

Yes I do!
Yes I do!
No you don't. You want a man who will lead you down the beach with his head over your eyes just so you can discover the feel of the sand under your feet. You want a guy who will take you into a cave with a thousand candles just to read you a poem. You want a man to wake you up at dawn
No. No -- Actually, let's make Ike the pastor.
I'd rather not.
I'd rather not.
Come on, it'll give you a great view. It's perfect. Hey.
I'm sorry, Bob. She kissed me back.
I kissed him back.
About a minute...?
A little longer for me.
A little longer for me.
Really?
Okay. So... what, uh... What just happened? Just now? Jus then? In there?
I don't know. I, uh -- I frankly don't even want to talk about it.
I don't know. I, uh -- I frankly don't even want to talk about it.
Me, either.
I love you. I love you.
I love you, too.
To who? Are you asking me?
Me?
Yes, you!
Well, you do have the dress.
Well, you do have the dress.
And the church.

And the wedding date. There's the two of us. So, you think... maybe... You have to go down the aisle with somebody you love and who love you back.

I'm okay with that.

So, we'll...
I've been making friends with your cat. Is it okay that I'm here?
I don't have much choice in the matter now, do I? But I can't speak for Italics. Traitor!
Livid is good. So what is it, Maggie? You here on business? I saw your lamps. They're terrific.
It's something I've always wanted to do.
You actually could make breaking and entering into a new career. So, what are you doing here?
I wanted to talk to you about why I run or ride away from things.
Does it matter?
I think so... When I was walking down the aisle? I was walking toward somebody who didn't have any idea who I really was. And it was only half the other person's fault, because I had done everything to convince him that I was exactly what he wanted. So it was good that I didn't go through with it because it would have been

Used?
They're mine. I'm turning in my running shoes to you.
They're mine. I'm turning in my running shoes to you.
This is getting serious.
You were not.

Pretty good speech, Maggie.
I borrowed it from this guy I know. So?
So -- Mag -- you've seen this, huh?
Yes, I've seen it. And I have to say it's the rudest and most offensive... joke anybody's ever played on me!
You're a goddess!

Stop it. When you talk like that, I get turned on and it frightens me.
Reporter?
Yup!
Hold on -- Nobody interviews Maggie in here unless they're getting haircut.
She's the boss.
Okay, he's on base. Can we talk about my life now? -- Ike's going to turn that tattoo stuff into a big deal -- that I was never serious about Gill, blah blah. He's totally out to get me.
For what reason? Some personal satisfaction?

That's what he says, but if he thinks that I don't realize he's writing another article, then he's an idiot.

There he is. Snoop Doggy-Dogg.

Over there. Ten o'clock. He's talking to our little Dennis. Dennis will turn into one of those "sources say" things.

Good morning to you, too. You look good.
Thank you. Do you think I flirt with Cory?
Thank you. Do you think I flirt with Cory?
Yes.
I know. I think sometimes you just sort of spaz-out with random excess flirtation energy and it just lands on anything male that moves.
On anything male that moves? As opposed to anything male that doesn't move?
I'm going to kill myself.
Why?
Why?
Because you think I'm all like... "Hey man, check me out".
Because you think I'm all like... "Hey man, check me out".
No, I don't think you're like, "I'm charming and mysterious in a way that even I don't understand and something about me is crying out for protection from a big man like you". Very hard to compete with. Especially to us married women who have lost our mystery.

Peggy, there's distinct possibility that I might be profoundly and irreversibly screwed up. Despite that, I love you and I can promise that I will no longer flirt with Cory, and I beg your forgiveness.
I'm not worried about you and Cory or Cory and me or even that you're irreversibly screwed up. But, Maggie, you've been like this since we were kids. And I think now that you are aware of it and that it hurts people's feelings, maybe it's time to move on with your life and commit to someone of your own, like Bob, if he's
I think you're right. Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?

Maggie, it's just a joke...

No. It's my life.
No. It's my life.
A harmless joke.

No, it's humiliating and you've been doing it since I was a kid. I don't like it. Stop. You may not like having a daughter with problems. But guess what? I don't like having a father who's drunk all the time. I'll eat in my room.
"What is unusual about Miss Carpenter is that she likes to dress her men up as grooms before she devours them. She has already disemboweled six in a row by leaving them at the altar."... I can't ready anymore.
"And her ritual feast continues as she prepares to make a sacrifice out of the seventh fiance. So all bets are on and we hope that this boomerang bride isn't honeymooning with Las Vegas odds makers because many predict that this girl is out of there before the race... before the rice hits the ground" Holy moly.
You tell Maggie.
No, you tell her.
No, you tell her.
No, no. You're her best friend.
No, no. You're her best friend.
No.

Is there somebody else?

Nope.
Nope.
You don't love me, is that it?

Miss Scarlett. In the broom closet. With the radio.
I gotta go. I'll see you at work. Walter, you scared me. Don't ever do that again.
Becky heard this woman on the radio complaining about this guy she was sure was Rick, which meant he was cheating on her. She was completely hysterical. Then it turned out the woman lived in Duluth.
That doesn't make any sense.

I do.
I do.
It's just like my grandmother's china.
Walter.
It was my mother's.
It was my mother's.
It's so beautiful. It's just what I would have picked out if I'd had every ring in the world to choose from. You see what I mean. There are people who would like a relationship to be full of surprises, but I am not one of them. Surprises are highly overrated.
Beautiful view, isn't it?
Walter, there's something I have to tell you --
I don't know what to say about it, Walter. It was a form of temporary insanity. But I had to tell you about it because --
-- it was a betrayal.
-- it was a betrayal.
Yes. But it wasn't really. It was just...
Yes. But it wasn't really. It was just...
So what happened?

I told you. Nothing --

At the top of the Empire State Building --

I'm not at the top of the Empire State Building. I'm here.
I'm not at the top of the Empire State Building. I'm here.
Not really. Look, Annie, I love you. Let's leave that out of it. I don't want to be someone you're settling for. I don't want to be someone anyone settles for. I have a life insurance policy, I'm fully invested in growth stocks, I have a paid subscription to Home Rox Office, I have no sexual diseases, I have been steadily employed in a
Oh, Walter. I don't deserve you.
I think that's what I'm saying.
You okay?
Yes. Some people will do anything to get out of going to a symphony.
Oh!
What?
What?
Look!
You should write something about this.
About what?
About what?
Whatever it is.
It's not true, but it feels true.
There's practically a whole book about how that statistic is not true --
What was that about up there?
What was what?
What was what?
What's with you?
What's with you?
Nothing's with me.
"Sleepless in Seattle"?
That's what she called him on the show. Because he can't sleep.
That's what she called him on the show. Because he can't sleep.
And now 2,000 women want his number. The guy could be a crackhead, a psychopath, a flasher, a junkie, a transvestite, a chain-saw murderer, or someone really sick, like Rick.

"I am not the sort of person who listens to call-in radio shows" --
And this woman is a writer! That's what everyone writes at the beginning of letters to strangers.
I know that. You think I don't know that? "I know that's a dumb way to begin, but it's the only way I can think of to convey what happened to me the other night when I heard the two of you on the radio. On the other hand, maybe I'm just losing my mind."

"On top of the Empire State Building at sunset on Valentine's Day."
Good. Perfect. I'll be in New York with Walter, I can squeeze it in.
You want to hear about destiny? If my husband hadn't gone on a diet, which caused me to leave him, I would never have been on that flight to Miami, and met Rick, and ended up having sex in the bathroom of a 727 with that nob you slide that says "vacant-occupied, vacant- occupied, vacant-occupied" --
You never told me you left your husband because he went on a diet.

Men never get this movie.

Do you think at the end of the movie when she's in the wheelchair they can still do it?

I always wondered about that too.
Hello.
Turn on your radio!
Turn on your radio!
What?
What?
The kid is on. You've got me listening to this garbage. Go on, turn it on.
I thought I would look into doing a story about those radio shows.
You'd probably have to go somewhere to really look into it.
You'd probably have to go somewhere to really look into it.
Definitely.
Did you talk to him?
I couldn't do it. How did I get here?
You told a lie and got on a plane.
That's not what I mean. I'm going back over there tomorrow and talk to him. I am.
That's not what I mean. I'm going back over there tomorrow and talk to him. I am.
Okay. Good. Goodbye.

He said hello.
It's a sign --
It's a sign I've watched this movie too many times. I'm so stupid. From the minute I listen to that stupid program on the radio, I've been a complete jerk.
You don't know who she was, Annie --
I saw her. She looked just like this --
This is a photo of hair.
Well, it's the same woman. And he was crazy about her. What is this? This is from Seattle.
Becky?
So I mailed your letter.
So I mailed your letter.
"Dear Annie: Thanks for your letter. It was great. We're very excited about meeting you in New York on Valentine's Day and seeing if we are M.F.E.O. Sleepless in Seattle."

M.F.E.O.?
M.F.E.O.?
Made for each other.
So he can't write. Big deal. I mean, verbal ability is a highly overrated thing in a guy, and our pathetic need for it is what gets us into so much trouble.
I'm going to run back to Walter's arms, if he's still have me.
I'm going to run back to Walter's arms, if he's still have me.
What about the letter?

It doesn't mean anything. It was written before I went out there. Before the ho.

No, I'm not.
No, I'm not.

We're going to the Rainbow Room and the symphony tomorrow night.
We're going to the Rainbow Room and the symphony tomorrow night.
I love the symphony.
I love the symphony.
I hate it. I'm so happy, Becky. Finally I feel happy. This is right. This is real. Everything else is what happens when you watch too many movies and completely lose sight of what counts. Please don't tell anyone about what happened. "Sleepless in Seattle" is history.
I need to know about him because... he's involved with my sister...
Okay.
Okay.
She has a pattern of getting involved with losers... Once she almost ran away with a human cannonball from the circus.

That's what I'm going to do. I'm going to go home. I quit. Laurie, I quit. I'm going back to Baltimore. How does a blonde do a high- five?
Perfect. Sandbag the father.
And you crazy? He thinks shows like this are dumb. If you didn't have an 800 number I could never get away with this --
Please --
This is a grotesque violation of this man's personal life, but never mind --
This is a complete disaster. I wanted him to find a wife, but he's got the wrong one --
How am I going to explain this to Walter?
Oh God, it's major. He's kissing her on the lips. I have to stop this.
Come on, Jonah --
Are you Annie?
Yes.
I'm Jonah. That's my dad. His name is Sam.
Hi, Jonah. Sam. And who is this?

But when you met her, did you believe she was the only person for you? That in some mystical, cosmic way, it was fated?

Annie, when you meet someone and you're attracted to them, it just means that your subconscious is attracted to their subconscious, subconsciously. So what we think of as chemistry is just two neuroses knowing that they are a perfect match.

I know, I know. I do not want to move to Seattle. But what I really don't want to do is end up always wondering what might have happened and knowing I could have done something. What do you think? It's just cold feet, isn't it? Everyone panics before they get married, didn't you?

Any time.
Everybody! Annie has an announcement --
Walter and I are engaged!
It's probably just the flowers --
We'll move them --
The Historical Society wanted this and I never would give it to them --
Granny's dress. Oh, Mom.

How did it happen?
It's silly, really. I mean, I'd seen him at the office, obviously I'd seen him, he's the associate publisher, and then one day we both ordered sandwiches from the same place, and he got my lettuce and tomato sandwich on whole wheat, which of course he was allergic to, and I got his lettuce and tomato on white.
How amazing.
How amazing.
It is, isn't it? You make millions of decisions that mean nothing and then one day you decide to order takeout and it changes your life.

Oh, please. Destiny's just something we've invented because we can't stand the fact that everything that happens is accidental.
Then how do you explain that you both ordered exactly the same sandwich except for the bread? How many people in this world like lettuce and tomato without something else like tuna?
Then how do you explain that you both ordered exactly the same sandwich except for the bread? How many people in this world like lettuce and tomato without something else like tuna?
It wasn't a sign. It was a coincidence.
I was in Atlantic City with my family. Cliff was a waiter. He talked me into sneaking out for a midnight walk on the Steel Pier. I've probably told you this a million times, but I don't care. And then he held my hand. I was scared. All sorts of thing were going through my head. But after a while I forgot about them.
What?
What?
You know.
You know.

Magic. It was magic.

I knew we would be together forever, and that everything would be wonderful, just the way you feel about Walter. Walter. It's quite a formal name, isn't it? One of the things I truly knew was that your father and I were going to have a wonderful time ... in the sack I believe you call it --

Hello.

Hi.
Hi. So far so good. So. What should we talk about? How insecure we were in high school. Shirley Votypka, the first girl I ever felt up. Health. What about health? Did you know that eating six macadamia nuts is the equivalent of eating a steak?

It's you.
It's me?
It's me?
The one in the street. I chased after you.
Which means --
The cabinets have to be redone --
Great. This is great. The whole town knows. Just out of curiosity, how do you two know?
Grace heard it.
Grace heard it.
Grace the dispatcher. Great.

The point is, take the client out to dinner and ask her to marry you and then maybe we won't have to redo the kitchen cabinets.

Why me? What about Jay?
Sam, if you're not doing anything New Year's -- obviously you're not doing anything New Year's -- we're having some people over, all of them married, not one even remotely interested in playing around. Does that sound great or what? I can't think of the last time I was at a party when anything actually happened.
Thanks, but I'll pass. It's kind of a big night. I don't like to leave Jonah alone.
Hello.
Hello, Sam, this is Dr. Marcia Fieldstone on Network America.
I'm probably not interested in whatever you're selling.
I'm not selling anything. Your son called and asked for advice on how to find you a new wife.

Jesus, are we on the air? Jonah, for God's sake --
I'm not mad at you. Okay, I'm not mad at you.
I think it's hard for him to talk to you about all this. Maybe we could talk and it would make him feel a little better.
All righ...
Good. How long ago did your wife die?

It's been about a year and a half.

And I don't want to invade your privacy --
We've been talking to -- well, let's just call him Sleepless in Seattle, and we'll be right back after this break with listener response, <u>your</u> response, to the things we've been discussing. The number to call is...
What's she talking about?
Do you think there's somebody out there you could love as much as your wife? Maybe even more?
It's hard to imagine.
What are you going to do, Sam?
I don't know. When I met my wife, it was so clear. I just <u>knew</u>.
What was it that made you know?
I don't think I could really describe it.
I don't think I could really describe it.
Why not?
Why not?
And if I could describe it, it probably wouldn't be on a radio show. But what the hell. It's not one specific thing. It's more of a feeling.
No last names, Jonah. Hello there, you sound younger than our usual callers. How come you're up so late?
It's not that late in Seattle.
It's not that late in Seattle.
Got me there. What's your Christmas wish, Jonah?
Got me there. What's your Christmas wish, Jonah?
It's not for me. It's for my dad. I think he needs a new wife.
You don't like the one he was now?
He doesn't have one now. That's the problem.
He doesn't have one now. That's the problem.
Where's your mom?

I've been pretty sad, but I think my dad is worse.

And you're worried about him.
And you're worried about him.
I'm worried about him, he's worried about me, I ride my bike to school, he follows in the car, like I'm not supposed to know he's there. Now it's Christmas, and you know what happens to people at Christmas.
No.
Why not?
Why not?
It's very hard for him to talk about this stuff. It's like it makes him sadder.
It's very hard for him to talk about this stuff. It's like it makes him sadder.
You want me to talk to him?
Is he home right now?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, I think I can help a little more if I talk to him directly.

Okay, but if I get yelled at, I'm never gonna listen to this show again.
Okay, but if I get yelled at, I'm never gonna listen to this show again.
Fair enough.
I have no doubt that you're a good dad. You can tell a lot from a person's voice. But something must be missing if Jonah feels that you're still under a cloud.
Tell her how you don't sleep at night.
They met at the Empire State Building, only they didn't. Never mind.
What kind of person would write to someone they heard on the radio?
Just because someone's looking for a nice guy doesn't make them desperate.

I'm not asking you to set me up, Jay. That's not what I need your help for. I want to know what it's like over there.

When's the latest time you were out there?
Seventy... eight.

Well. Things are different. First, you have to be friends. You have to like each other. Then you neck. This can go on for years. Then you have tests. Then you get to do it with a condom. The good news is, split the check.

I don't get it.

Nobody knows. It changes practically every day. How much money do you have?

Dad --
What is it?
What is it?
There's somebody on the phone for you. His name is Sam.
I can hear you walking around sometimes. At first I thought it was a robber. Go ahead, tell her, Dad.
I don't think I have to now.
The hopes are perfect -- beautiful, identical, smooth -- and they are for something really amazing I feel it in my bones --
It's a spice rack.

Just out of curiosity, do you have any friends whose names don't begin with a J? I feel like it was a failure of the imagination on our part naming you Jonah. What is marjoram? Does anyone know?

Jed is having a slumber party New Year's Eve and he invited me.
Fine. Fine.
So I can go.
So I can go.
Sure. Looking good.

Shouldn't you have used a toggle bolt?

I think I know how to have a spice rack.
I'm sorry. I'm just --
Stressed.
Stressed.
Right. I'm sorry, Jonah, I'm sorry.
Just out of curiosity, how did they get our address?
They called and asked for it. "Dear Sleepless in Seattle. You are the most attractive man I've ever laid ears on."
How did they get our phone number?
You have to give them your phone number or they won't let you go on the air.
"Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I am an SWF"-- What is that?
Thank God. Something you don't know. It's a single white female.

But not dinner necessarily on the first date because by the time you're halfway through dinner you might be sorry you asked them to dinner whereas if it's just a drink, if you like them you can always ask them for dinner but if you don't you can go home if you see what I mean. I wonder if it still works this way.

It doesn't. They ask you.

I'm starting to notice that.
If you get a new wife, I guess you'll have sex with her, huh?
What do you think?
What do you think?
Will she scratch up your back?

In the movies women are always scratching up guy's back and screaming and stuff. When they're having sex.

Like do you believe in heaven?
Like do you believe in heaven?
I never did. Or the whole idea of an afterlife. But I don't know any more. I have these dreams about... your mom... and we have long talks about... about you, and how you are, which she sort of knows but I tell her anyway. So what is that? It's sort of an afterlife, isn't it?

I'm starting to forget her.
I'm starting to forget her.
I know. But she's here, Jonah. Because I have you. And as long as I have you, I have your Mom.
I... uh... have a date with someone Friday night.
Good.
This one's for both of us.
Sleepless and Son. Baltimore.
Great.
I look stupid. I look stupid, don't I? I look like I'm trying too hard. I was going to get a haircut but then I thought I'd look like I just got a haircut.

Jonah, I'm leaving --
Jonah, I'm leaving --
WAIT!!! -- "and while we're on the subject, let's just say right now that Brooks Robinson was the best third baseman ever. It's important that you agree with me on that because I'm from Baltimore." Dad, she thinks Brooks Robinson is the greatest.
Dad!
Everyone thinks Brooks Robinson is the greatest.
Everyone thinks Brooks Robinson is the greatest.
It's a sign.
It's a sign.
Oh, right.
Here is Seattle. And here is Baltimore. Case closed.
She doesn't want us to go to Baltimore. She wants to meet us in New York City on Valentine's Day. On top of the Empire State Building.
She doesn't want us to go to Baltimore. She wants to meet us in New York City on Valentine's Day. On top of the Empire State Building.
Perfect. We'll be there.
I figure we could go to New York, catch the Knicks, and since we'd be there anyway, obviously we'd go to the Empire State Building --
There she is.
Why is she bringing that bag?
She's going to cook something for us?
Okay, tiger. Time for bed.
It's only ten o'clock.
It's only ten o'clock.
Jonah!
Jonah!
Okay.
Okay.
Thank Victoria for dinner.

Thanks for dinner. I never saw anybody cook potatoes that way.

I'm glad you liked it. Good night, Jonah.
Don't ever do that again.
I thought I saw a black widow spider.
What are you doing up?
I was thirsty.

There's a bathroom upstairs.

This is not a joke. Thank God Victoria doesn't know. It would really have hurt her feelings.
This is not a joke. Thank God Victoria doesn't know. It would really have hurt her feelings.
If she knew, she'd never forgive me. It would be hopeless for the two of you.
Jonah, this isn't fair. You don't know Victoria. I hardly know her myself. She is, in fact, a mystery to me. She tosses her hair a lot. Why does she do this? I have no idea. Is it a twitch? Does she need a haircut? Should she use barrette so it doesn't keep falling in her face? These are things that I'm willing to
Was Mom an adjustment?
Was Mom an adjustment?
I'm never going to meet anyone who's going to measure up to your mom in your eyes? What do you think? There's a perfect woman walking around out there?
God, she's beautiful.
Victoria? She's okay.
Dad, I was talking to Jessica about reincarnation, and she thinks that probably you knew Annie in another life.
Who is Annie?
Who is Annie?
The one who wrote us.
The reason I know this and you don't is that I'm younger and purer so I'm more in touch with cosmic forces.
I sincerely hope you are not going to marry Jessica.
Have you seen my wallet?
It might be in the kitchen.
I'm only going to be away one night, okay, and Clarise will be here. You'll have a swell time. You'll watch a little Geraldo, some Nightmare on Elm Street 12, I'll never know.
Are you going with her?
Are you going with her?
Yes.
I have to have a life. I have to do things that I want with people my own age. It's none of your business who I am going out with. I don't give a good goddam if you're angry --
This is the one I like.
Fine. I won't say anything. You can marry Count Dracula.
Thank you, Jonah. But the point is, I am not asking permission.
Thank you, Jonah. But the point is, I am not asking permission.
What's wrong with Annie?
What's wrong with Annie?
Shut up.
Shut up? Shut up??? Mom never did that. Mom never said shut up to me. Mom never yelled at me.

I can't believe you flew first class.
It was all they had.
Maybe we'll get a dog when we get back.
Okay.
Okay.
What do you mean, okay? Wouldn't you like a dog?
What do you mean, okay? Wouldn't you like a dog?
Sure.
Hi, Sam. And let me guess -- you must be Jonah.
Hi. He should book now because we can get an excursion fare. Jessica's parents are travel agents and --
Do you like baseball?
Yes, I do. In fact, my firm has box seats for the Mariners. Why don't we all go next week?

Well...

I think they're announcing your flight.
Hi.
Hi. Sam?
Hi. Sam?
Yes?
Yes?
You must be Jonah.
We live two piers over, don't we? Number 12, right? We're having like a really neat open house today from like four to whenever if you care to stop by.
Thanks, but... we've got plans.
Thanks, but... we've got plans.
Well, here's the number. If you ever find yourself Sleepless, give us a call. We also... do babysitting.
Five minutes in the microwave. Any one of them, five minutes and done. Ready to eat. Do you know how to make juice?
Microwave. Five minutes.
Eventually, in a few months, you'll start seeing women, you'll meet someone.
Move on. Right. That's what I'm going to do. In a few months, boom, I'll be fine, I'll just grow a new heart.
Move on. Right. That's what I'm going to do. In a few months, boom, I'll be fine, I'll just grow a new heart.
I'm sorry --
God, it's wonderful to see you. Where's Greg?
He's over at the boat show. He'll be by later. It's so beautiful here.
You saw her in the airport and then here?
I tried to talk to her... It was like I knew her. Weird.
How's Jonah taking it?
It'll take him a while to come around. A month ago he called one of those radio call-in shows and told them I needed a wife --

You're kidding --
You're kidding --
Now that I'm seeing someone, it's a whole other thing.
It's a little derivative.
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
"An Affair To Remember." Did you ever see it? Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr. Before that it was called "Love Affair With Irene Dunne And Charles Boyer."
Anyway, Victoria's nice.
Would you follow <U>her</U> through an airport?
Would you follow <U>her</U> through an airport?
Look, I met somebody. She's good, and capable and smart. We hit it off. We can't spend your life chasing after fantasies.
Hi.
Hi.
You look good.
You look good yourself.
I thought you were never going to call me.
You did?

I really wanted you to call me, and I thought you were never going to --

Oh.
Oh.
So whatdya say? I'll get the check, and I'll call you in eight months.
We can't finish the job. She's on her sixth painter, now she's thinking maybe she wants the fireplace rebricked --
I know her pretty well. Maybe I could call her --
I know her pretty well. Maybe I could call her --
I've already solved it. I've hired a hit man.
Is he there?
No. After he was born, every time we started to make love, he would cry. He had an uncanny sense of timing. We really shouldn't do anything here anyway.
No. After he was born, every time we started to make love, he would cry. He had an uncanny sense of timing. We really shouldn't do anything here anyway.
Absolutely. Right.
He's ten.
He's good at it.

I read an article about this ...

Absolutely. When I come back, maybe the two of us should spend some time together, on our own. What do you think?
Absolutely. When I come back, maybe the two of us should spend some time together, on our own. What do you think?
Sure. Sure.
I told you it would happen. It's bound to happen when a man works alone!
Why didn't you give a warning signal?
Why didn't you give a warning signal?
Your foreman says that's a foreman's job.
Want to go up to your office, Mr. Alexander?
Naturally. You think I parked here for a cup of coffee?

You're welcome to one.

No thanks.
No thanks.
The men would like to know who this gentleman is.
The men would like to know who this gentleman is.
That's none of their affair.
I mean it. I know your work record. You were in line for foreman when this trouble started -- did you know that? You had a real future with this company, but you let those Reds stir you up. And now they'll sell you down the river. Why don't you wake up, Ray? That's your name, isn't it, Ray?
No. My name is Quintero. Mister Quintero.
Are you going to let us pass -- or do I have to call the Sheriff?
There's nothing stopping you.
Mornin'.
How's it going?
How's it going?
Well, those new fellows you hired from out of town -- we brought 'em up here in a truck this morning, but they took one look at that picket line and turned tail.
Not so sure about that. Letter of the Law, you know. All the injunction says is no picketing by miners.
Whose side are you on anyway?
Whose side are you on anyway?
Now don't get excited, Mr. Alexander. They'll scatter like a covey of quail.
Well?
I've tried everything but shootin' 'em down.
I've tried everything but shootin' 'em down.
You haven't tried locking them up!
You haven't tried locking them up!
You want 'em all arrested?
You want 'em all arrested?
No, just the ring leaders. The fire-eaters. And the ones with big families ... Barton -- where's that boy?
Got any more ideas?
I don't make policy.
Take a drink. Calm down!
I say we gotta take action. Now.
Now why don't you let these gentlemen pass? Don't you know who's in that car?
It's the paymaster from Moscow -- with our gold.
It's the paymaster from Moscow -- with our gold.
No, no, it's the president of the company himself -- come all the way out here to make Jenkins general manager. So why you acting so mean?
Jenkins ain't no boss. Mean we're gonna let people like Jenkins stay here?
You can't send him back to Oklahoma. It'd be inhumane.
How goes it?
It never ends.
Three hours! Just to heat enough water to wash this stuff! I tell you something. If this strike is ever settled -- which I doubt -- I don't go back to work unless the company installs hot running water for us. It should've been a union demand from the beginning.
Yeah.
It's like Charley Vidal says -- there's two kinds of slavery, wage slavery and domestic slavery. The Woman Question, he calls it.
The woman question?
The woman question?
Question, question -- the problem, what to do about 'em.
Question, question -- the problem, what to do about 'em.
So? What does he want to do about 'em?

He says give 'em equality. Equality in jobs, equality in the home. Also sex equality.

What do you mean -- sex equality?

You know ... What's good for the goose is good for the gander.
Hear you had a little trouble, Quintero. Defective fuse? Well, you're all in one piece. So what's the beef?
You know the beef. This new rule of yours, that we work alone. We're taking it up with the Super.
You know the beef. This new rule of yours, that we work alone. We're taking it up with the Super.
Super's busy -- with your Negotiatin' Committee.
Super's busy -- with your Negotiatin' Committee.
So much the better.
Now wait a minute. Super's the one made the rule. He ain't gonna give you no helper.
He will if he wants us to go on blasting.
Foreman wants to get the ore out. Miner wants to get his brothers out. In one piece.
You work alone, savvy? You can't handle the job, I'll find someone who can.
You work alone, savvy? You can't handle the job, I'll find someone who can.
Who? A scab?
Who? A scab?
An American.
I checked the drift just before he blasted. It was all clear ... The man must have been asleep or something.
You weren't even there. You were back at the station. Kalinsky told me ...
You weren't even there. You were back at the station. Kalinsky told me ...
You're a liar, Pancho. A no-good, dirty ...
Are you sick, Mama?
No, Estellita.
No, Estellita.
Are you sad? Are we going to church? For your confession?
Are you sad? Are we going to church? For your confession?
Later. When I finish the ironing.
Mama, can I put the candles ...
Hush... not a word about the cake, hear?
Why are they singing, Mama?
They are singing for me.
They are singing for me.
Can we light the candles now? On the cake?
Can we light the candles now? On the cake?
Yes. We will light the candles.
To the mine?
Sure. Where they're negotiating. In the company office. We'll go up there and picket the place.
Come on, Esperanza -- how about it? We got to.
No. No. I can't. If Ramón ever found me on a picket line ...
He can't drink this milk. It'll make him sick. He's on a formula. I was a fool! I shouldn't have kept him with me.
Don't you worry. We'll get some action.
It's all set. Consuelo's squad can take they day off tomorrow. We're taking over.
Good. Come in, we'll work it out. Sit down, sit down.
So they had a little taste of what its like to be a woman ... and they run away.
With Ramón it's ... pride. I spoke out of the bitterness in me. And he was hurt.
We're only one payment behind. I argued with her. It isn't right.
It isn't right, she says. Was it right that we bought this ... this instrument?
But you had to have it, didn't you? It was so nice to listen
I listen to it. Every night. When you're out to the beer parlor.
Where you going?
Got to talk to the brothers.
This water's cold again.
I'm sorry. The fire's gone out.
Forget it.
Forget it? I chop wood for the stove five times a day. Every time I remember. I remember that across the tracks the Anglo miners have hot water in pipes. And bathrooms. Inside.
Forget it? I chop wood for the stove five times a day. Every time I remember. I remember that across the tracks the Anglo miners have hot water in pipes. And bathrooms. Inside.
Do you think I like living this way? What do you want of me?!
We did. It got lost in the shuffle.
What?
What?
We can't get everything at once. Right now we've got more important demands.
We can't get everything at once. Right now we've got more important demands.
What's more important than sanitation?
What's more important than sanitation?
The safety of the men -- that's more important! Five accidents this week -- all because of speed-up. You're a woman, you don't know what it's like up there.
First we got to get equality on the job. Then we'll work on these other things. Leave it to the men.
I see. The men. You'll strike, maybe, for your demands -- but what the wives want, that comes later, always later.
I see. The men. You'll strike, maybe, for your demands -- but what the wives want, that comes later, always later.
Now don't start talking against the union again.
Now don't start talking against the union again.
What has it got me, your union?
Esperanza, have you forgotten what it was like before the union came? When Estella was a baby, and we couldn't even afford a doctor when she got sick? It was for our families! We met in graveyards to build that union!
All right. Have your strike. I'll have my baby. But no hospital will take me, because I'll be a striker's wife. The store will cut off our credit, and the kids will go hungry. And we'll get behind on the payments again, and then they'll come and take away the radio...

Is that all you care about? That radio? Can't you think of anything except yourself?
Is that all you care about? That radio? Can't you think of anything except yourself?
If I think of myself it's because you never think of me. Never. Never. Never...
Stop it! The children are watching. Stop it!
Never... never... never!
Never... never... never!
Aaah, what's the use?
I did not mean to weep again. Why should I weep for joy?
I'm a fool.
I'm a fool.
No, no ...
Was it expensive, the beer?
Antonio paid for it.
Antonio paid for it.
Forgive me ... for saying you never thought of me.
Forgive me ... for saying you never thought of me.
I did forget. Luís told me.
What's the matter?
It's nothing. Just a little catch ...
Mother of God ...have mercy ...
Have mercy on this child ... let this child live ...
A fighter, huh?
He was born fighting. And born hungry.
He was born fighting. And born hungry.
Drink, drink, Juanito. You'll never have it so good.
Drink, drink, Juanito. You'll never have it so good.
He'll have it good. Some day.
What were they saying? About you? In there?
They say I am no good to you.
They say I am no good to you.
You are no good to me -- in jail.
You are no good to me -- in jail.
I'd lie on my cot in the cell and I couldn't sleep with the bugs and the stink and the heat. And I'd say to myself, think of something nice. Something beautiful. And then I'd think of you. And my heart would pound against the cot for love of you.
Not just Juanito. You'll have it good too, Esperanza. We're going to win this strike.
What makes you so sure?
What makes you so sure?
Because if we lose, we lose more than a strike. We lose the union. And the men know this. And if we win, we win more than a few demands. We win... ... something bigger. Hope. Hope for our kids. Juanito can't grow strong on milk alone.
Let them take it!
Over my dead body.
Over my dead body.
I don't want your dead body. I don't want you back in jail either.
I don't want your dead body. I don't want you back in jail either.
But it's yours. I won't let them ...
But it's yours. I won't let them ...
Can't you see they want to start a fight so that they can lock you all up at one time?
It's not fair ... I should be there with them. After all, I'm the one who got the women the vote.
No.
No.
But the motion passed. It's ... it's not democratic of you to ...

Sure.
Must've been some experience for you, huh?
Yes.
Yes.
I guess you got enough today to last a lifetime, huh?
I guess you got enough today to last a lifetime, huh?
I'm going back tomorrow.
You might get hurt. Listen, if you think I'm gonna play nursemaid from now on, you're crazy ... I've had these kids all day!
I've had them since the day they were born.
I'm telling you. I don't stay home with these kids tomorrow.
Okay. Then, tomorrow, I take the kids with me to the picket line.
How do you feel?
I'm okay. But it's nice to be home.
I'm okay. But it's nice to be home.
Four nights. How did you sleep?
Four nights. How did you sleep?
We raised such a fuss they finally brought cots in.
Did you have to sign a pledge? Not to go back to the line?
No, no ... we wouldn't do it.
But if you go back they'll lock you up again.
No, no ... the Sheriff had enough of us. We drove him crazy.
We've got to have a talk, you and me.
All right, but later. I've got a meeting now.
All right, but later. I've got a meeting now.
A meeting?
A meeting?
Yes. To plan for the picket line tomorrow.
I waited up till midnight.
You weren't waiting for me.
You weren't waiting for me.
That meeting only lasted ten minutes. The first night I'm home, and you run to the beer parlor. What is it? Can't you bear the sight of me?
That meeting only lasted ten minutes. The first night I'm home, and you run to the beer parlor. What is it? Can't you bear the sight of me?
Be still ...
Be still ...
But you wanted to talk. Tell me.
Tell me.
We can't go on this way. I just can't go on living with you. Not this way.
We can't go on this way. I just can't go on living with you. Not this way.
No. We can't can't go on this way. We can't go back to the old way either.
Where are you going?
Hunting.
Hunting.
When?
When?
Sun up.
Sun up.
Alone?
Alone?
No.
No.
Ramón -- you can't.
Ramón -- you can't.
Why not? I'm not needed here.
Why not? I'm not needed here.
But you are needed. Especially now -- with most of the other men away. You're captain of the stand-by squad.
But you are needed. Especially now -- with most of the other men away. You're captain of the stand-by squad.
Sure, the standby squad. Stand-by for the funeral.
Sure, the standby squad. Stand-by for the funeral.
Whose funeral? We're doing all right. There hasn't been a scab near the picket line for three days.
Whose funeral? We're doing all right. There hasn't been a scab near the picket line for three days.
And you know why? Because the company knows they can starve us out -- even if it takes another two, three months. What's it to them if the mine's shut down a little longer?
And you know why? Because the company knows they can starve us out -- even if it takes another two, three months. What's it to them if the mine's shut down a little longer?
It's a lot to them. They'd do anything to open that mine.
It's a lot to them. They'd do anything to open that mine.
Aah! They've got other mines. You don't see the larger picture. They've got millions. Millions. They can outlast us, and they know it.
Aah! They've got other mines. You don't see the larger picture. They've got millions. Millions. They can outlast us, and they know it.
You mean you're ready to give up?
You mean you're ready to give up?
Who said anything about giving up? I'll never go back to the company on my knees. Never.
Ramón were not getting weaker. We're stronger than ever before. They're getting weaker. They thought they could break our picket line. And they failed. And now they can't win unless they pull off something big, and pull it off fast.
Like what?
Like what?
I don't know. But I can feel it coming. It's like ... like a lull before the storm. Charley Vidal says ...
I don't know. But I can feel it coming. It's like ... like a lull before the storm. Charley Vidal says ...
Charley Vidal says! Don't throw Charley Vidal up to me!
Charley Vidal says! Don't throw Charley Vidal up to me!
Charley's my friend. I need friends. Why are you afraid to have me as your friend?
Charley's my friend. I need friends. Why are you afraid to have me as your friend?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I don't know what you're talking about.
No, you don't. Have you learned nothing from this strike? Why are you afraid to have me at your side? Do you still think you can have dignity only if I have none?
No, you don't. Have you learned nothing from this strike? Why are you afraid to have me at your side? Do you still think you can have dignity only if I have none?
You talk of dignity? After what you've been doing?
You talk of dignity? After what you've been doing?
Yes. I talk of dignity. The Anglo bosses look down on you, and you hate them for it. "Stay in your place, you dirty Mexican" -- that's what they tell you. But why must you say to me, "Stay in your place." Do you feel better having someone lower than you?
Yes. I talk of dignity. The Anglo bosses look down on you, and you hate them for it. "Stay in your place, you dirty Mexican" -- that's what they tell you. But why must you say to me, "Stay in your place." Do you feel better having someone lower than you?
Shut up, you're talking crazy.
Whose neck shall I stand on, to make me feel superior? And what will I get out of it? I don't want anything lower than I am. I'm low enough already. I want to rise. And push everything up with me as I go ...
Will you be still?
Will you be still?
And if you can't understand this you're a fool -- because you can't win this strike without me! You can't win anything without me!
This is what we've been waiting for.
What are you saying?
What are you saying?
This means they've given up trying to break the picket line. Now we can all fight together -- all of us.
Why didn't you support her? You're the worst of the lot.
But honey ...
But honey ...
Or why don't you just put a sign outside? "No dogs or women allowed!"
We can't think of them just as housewives -- but as allies. And we've got to treat them as such.
Look who's talking! The Great White Father, and World's Champion of Women's Rights.

Aw, cut it out, Ruth.
Aw, cut it out, Ruth.
Me, I'm a camp follower -- following this organizer from one mining camp to another -- Montana, Colorado, Idaho. But did he ever think to organize the women? No. Wives don't count in the Anglo locals either.
Don't horse me. Price of zinc's never been higher. They don't want no strike -- not with their war boom on.
Then why's the company hanging tough? They've signed contracts with other locals -- why not this one?
Then why's the company hanging tough? They've signed contracts with other locals -- why not this one?
Because most of us here are Mexican- Americans! Because we want equality with Anglo miners -- the same pay, the same conditions.
Because most of us here are Mexican- Americans! Because we want equality with Anglo miners -- the same pay, the same conditions.
Exactly. And equality's the one thing the bosses can't afford. The biggest club they have over the Anglo locals is, "Well -- at least you get more than the Mexicans."
Exactly. And equality's the one thing the bosses can't afford. The biggest club they have over the Anglo locals is, "Well -- at least you get more than the Mexicans."
Okay, so discrimination hurts the Anglo too, but it hurts me more. And I've had enough of it!
Hear those deputies slugged 'Cente.
Yeah. Lots of provocation lately. They figure if they can lock up the leadership on some phony riot charge, maybe they can bust the strike.
Go on. Spill it.
Well, you're the organizer. You work out strike strategy -- and most of the time you're dead right. But when you figure everything the rank-and-file's to do down to the last detail, you don't give us anything to think about. You afraid we're too lazy to take initiative?

You know I don't think that.
You know I don't think that.
Maybe not. But there's another thing ... like when you came in tonight -- I heard you ask your wife, "Who's that? His grandfather?"
That's all right -- it's no secret. My name's Hartwell. I'm from the company's Eastern office.
You mean Delaware?
You mean Delaware?
No. New York.
No. New York.
New York? You're not the Company President by any chance?
New York? You're not the Company President by any chance?
No ...
No ...
Too bad. The men've always wanted to get a look at the President. But you've come out here to settle the strike?

Well, if that's possible ...

It's possible. Just negotiate.

Forgot what?
Forgot what?
It's Mama's Saint's Day.
Luís! Come down here!
Papa! We seen 'em! Two scabs! Over there!
Where's your mama?
She's coming. Charley Vidal gave her a lift.
Boy! Did you see the way Mama whopped that deputy with her shoe? Knocked the gun right out ...
I don't want you hanging around there, hear?
Papa, can't I leave now? There's a meeting of the Junior Shop Stewards ...
The what!
The what!
The Junior Shop Stewards. There's lots of ways we can help.

I know, it's wrong. Just let me go. I'll leave town ... just let me go.
You think I was going to work you over? I wouldn't dirty my hands with you ...
But you don't pull a strike when the bosses want it -- so they can smash your union. You wait till you're ready, so you can win.
Do the bosses wait? No sanitation. So my kids get sick. Does the company doctor wait? Twenty bucks. So we miss one payment on the radio I bought for my wife. Does the company store wait? "Pay -- or we take it away." Why they in such a hurry, the bosses' store? They're trying to scare us, that's why -- to make us afraid
And another thing. Your attitude toward Anglos. If you're gonna be a leader ...
What attitude?
What attitude?
You lump them all together -- Anglo workers and Anglo bosses.

Tem thousand dollars. Everything I could spare. It's for you.
Tem thousand dollars. Everything I could spare. It's for you.
But why? You only owe me five. And that's not till after we close the deal tonight.
But why? You only owe me five. And that's not till after we close the deal tonight.
You aren't coming with me.
Okay
Wait till I tell you what it is.
Wait till I tell you what it is.
It don't matter. I'll do it. And you sure as hell don't have to pay me.
Why?
You're my best friend, man. I'd do anything for you.
Jimmy, look, there's something I have to tell you.
Hey, check it out...
What the hell is that?
It's you! I didn't have a picture or nothin' so I had to describe you to the guy. Not bad though, huh?
What?
I'm not a tweaker. I don't use drugs. I never had.
But...I've seen you.
When? When did you ever see me use?
When? When did you ever see me use?
This isn't like that Queen Elizabeth question, is it?
This isn't like that Queen Elizabeth question, is it?
You ever notice how I always showed up, in the middle of a binge? Left before it was over? How I sneak away for cap-naps? How when the crank came around to me, I always said I'd just done one?
No one ever noticed?
Are you kidding me? A bunch of amped -out tweakers? It was easy.
But... why? Why would you pretend?
I can't tell you.
I can't tell you.
You don't trust me?
You don't trust me?
I don't trust anybody.
I don't trust anybody.
And you want me to do you some big favor?
Wait If you don't trust me, why did you tell me that stuff about not using drugs?
Because I don't want to see you end up like Kujo and those other losers. I thought that maybe if you knew that I didn't use, you might see it in yourself to go clear.
I don't know... a little. I wish you would have let me in on it from the beginning.
I'm sorry. I couldn't.
Nah... I want to keep it. Maybe I can use it for like, inspiration ...you know...like when I detox?
Good for you Jimmy.
Wouldn't be a favor if you were paying me. I'll just take my five when the deal is done.
You're a good man. Jimmy the Finn.
Then why don't I see any pictures Of me up there?
That was my idea.
That was my idea.
You never did like me much, did you Verne? And you can't stand it that I walked out of there alive and Liz didn't. You think I'm a coward, don't you?
By not disgracing her memory!
What does that mean?
What does that mean?
You might as well be spitting on her grave every time you put drugs up your nose. Or did you just conveniently forget that it was drug dealers who killed my daughter?
You don't understand.
Understand what?
I'm gonna get this developed and send it to the Warren Commission.
Um, I think the Warren Commission has been closed for a while.
Um, I think the Warren Commission has been closed for a while.
No shit? Fuck it. I'll send it to Oliver Stone then. He'll get them to reopen the bastard.
Yeah, I uh, have a buyer who's looking for about a quarter's worth.
Crank or glass?
Crank or glass?
The good stuff. Can you handle that?
I'm sorry. Would you like a taste?
No, I'm good.
No, I'm good.
I insist. It's delicious. Just a taste.
Not bad.
Secret recipe.
Can we talk price?
Make me an offer.
Make me an offer.
I don't know, 14,000 a kilo?
I don't know, 14,000 a kilo?
I deal in U.S. pounds, friend. None of that faggot metric crap for me.
I deal in U.S. pounds, friend. None of that faggot metric crap for me.
Okay ... How about um .. 6,000 a ounce.
Okay ... How about um .. 6,000 a ounce.
Hey, okay.
You're serious?
Anything for a dear friend.
Anything for a dear friend.
But I just met you.
But I just met you.
But you're a friend of Jimmy's. I think of you as a brother already.
So that's 40 lbs. at 6 a pound then?
If you say so.
If you say so.
Pooh-Bear, I don't mean to be rude, but I get the feeling you aren't taking me seriously.
Maybe you're the one who isn't taking me seriously.
Why do you say that?
Why do you say that?
I welcome you here with open arms and you got the nerve to low-ball me like some slick used car salesman.
I welcome you here with open arms and you got the nerve to low-ball me like some slick used car salesman.
Hey, I was just trying to ...

I want to tell you about the last guy who tried to jam me up on a deal.
I want to tell you about the last guy who tried to jam me up on a deal.
Hey, I don't play that.
You want to do this some other time?
Pull your pants down.
Pull your pants down.
I'm sorry?
I'm sorry?
Pull your motherfucking pants down.
Come on, guys ...
Big Bill.
Pooh-Bear. come on, man. What is this? It's me, Danny. I thought we had a deal.
Big Bill
Captain Steubing thinks you might work for the police.
What?!
Don't address me. I didn't make the accusation.
Please .. I don't know what you're ...
Please .. I don't know what you're ...
Uh-uh-uh ...
Shoot him.
Okay! Okay!
Now get talkin'
I didn't fucking do anything! I swear to God!
CAN I PULL MY FUCKING DICK OUT?!
Yeah.
I ought to just call this whole thing off right now.
Don't do that. Please. Or I'll kill you. Please, Danny.
Don't do that. Please. Or I'll kill you. Please, Danny.
What the hell was that? Who told you I was five-0?
What the hell was that? Who told you I was five-0?
No one. It was just a test. I need to be sure of who I'm dealing with from time-to-time.
Did it ever occur to you that someone might cop to something they didn't do rather than have their balls chewed off by a rabid weasel?
I'll keep that in mind.
What the hell is this?
Just some buddies.
Just some buddies.
This is bullshit. You didn't say anything about anybody else being here.
This is bullshit. You didn't say anything about anybody else being here.
What the fuck are you gonna do about it, dickhead?
Cool it. We got business.
Yeah, dickhead.
I've got a hot one.
You go, boy.
You go, boy.
If it's all the same to you, I'd rather not dish right here in the middle of Crankville.
Feeling the paranoia tonight, are we?
Well, you know what they say, just because you're paranoid, doesn't mean everyone's not out to slice your balls off and shove 'em down your throat.
You got a name?
Bobby, rhymes with hobby.
Bobby, rhymes with hobby.
What?
What?
Never mind. Dude had a backfull of jailhouse tatts.

No last name?
No last name?
It was all pretty informal. Didn't have a lot of time to exchange pleasantries.
Yeah. Pretty sure. Oh yeah ... he had a spear gun, too.
God damn, Flynne, you are one observant tweaker.
God damn, Flynne, you are one observant tweaker.
Somebody has to help you lazy bastards.
Danny, I'm touched.
Don't be. I'm worried about the kid.
You think I'm a Judas?
Hard to compare the people you're taking down with the Lord.

Garcetti thinks I'm a pile of shit.

Thanks for not judging me.
It's not my place.
It's not my place.
Don't you wonder why I do it?
Don't you wonder why I do it?
The money? The drugs? Keeping yourself out of jail? I know the drill.
You don't find that repugnant?
Just the way the world works. Look, as far as tweakers go, you aren't a bad guy. You never hurt anyone but yourself as far as I know.

Tell that to Bobby ... and his wife and kid.
Tell that to Bobby ... and his wife and kid.
Bobby laid his own tracks. He could have gone quietly but he played the hard-ass con till the end. And as far as I'm concerned, he wife and kid are a hell of a lot better off without him. Now take the money.
I was getting to it.
Tell me what?
If he finds out it's me, I'm a dead man.
Danny, he isn't gonna find out it's you. Domingo was a slinger, he must have sold to hundreds of different people.
Look, we'll talk to the A.D.A.
When?
When?
Soon. I promise. We'll get the charges dropped and you can disappear. In the mean time, trust me, he has no idea that you ratted him out.
What the hell are you doing here?
Question is, what are you doing here?
Question is, what are you doing here?
I was trying to score some dope.

Cut the shit, Flynne.
Cut the shit, Flynne.
Someone want to tell me what the hell is going on here?
Someone want to tell me what the hell is going on here?
Okay, asshole, you wanna play, we'll play.
You think this is funny motherfucker?
I can't help it, Tanner, you hit like a fucking girl.
I met the guy at a party. He said he wanted to do a biggie. He's new in town so I offered my services.
This chink have a name?
This chink have a name?
Bubba.
You better not be blowing smoke up My ass, Flynne.
After that ass-whipping you gave me?
What're your taking down?
Standard vig. Minus five for a certain blabber-mouth moron by the name of Jimmy the Finn, who's living proof that natural selection is a flawed theory.
Did you really think you were slick enough to pull this off?
Look man, I just wanted to make some dough and disappear. I didn't want to wait around for Domingo to figure out who doubled back on him.
You've got no choice.
Whata you mean I've got no choice?
Whata you mean I've got no choice?
Well, if you'd rather do a stretch in la casa grande ...
Well, if you'd rather do a stretch in la casa grande ...
For that old possession charge? Gimme a break.
For that old possession charge? Gimme a break.
No. You just handed us a new one. We can go Federal on your ass right now: ongoing criminal conspiracy. Intent to buy and distribute $250,000 worth of crank. What's the mandatory on that, Al?
Bullshit. He's a liar.
News-flash, Tanner. I'm a fucking rat.
News-flash, Tanner. I'm a fucking rat.
You think you're so god damned smart, don't you?
That's because he doesn't have one.
Whata you mean? He told me -
Whata you mean? He told me -
Guy scores dope and dollar from ripping off other drug dealers. As least that's what the word is.
Guy scores dope and dollar from ripping off other drug dealers. As least that's what the word is.
What's to stop him from just ripping me off then?
What's to stop him from just ripping me off then?
That's probably what he would have done if we hadn't found out about your get-rich-quick scheme.
What? Is it bad?
I'm afraid so, Danny.
I'm afraid so, Danny.
Who is it?
That's real sweet, Garcetti. Thanks.
We got the 411 on your good old boy.
Murder. Beautiful.
Pumped fifty-seven bullets into a police informant.
Took a pig-slicker to the heart.
Jesus.
Jesus.
I thought you'd be happy.
I thought you'd be happy.
Yeah.
Danny?
My name is Tom.
Whatever you say, man. Look ... can we talk about this?
Yeah. Okay. Listen carefully ... You're in the bathroom. You've been shot in the shoulder ...
Please ... don't do this ...
Answer the fucking question!
This the guy?
It speaks!
That's him. He's a lot prettier in person though.
Cut to the fucking chase, Flynne.
Cut to the fucking chase, Flynne.
Dude is bugging. Transparent spiders, plastic men - the whole nine yards.
Dude is bugging. Transparent spiders, plastic men - the whole nine yards.
What's he holding?
Then why didn't you help the kid when you were there?
Hey, you want me to do all your work for you, numbnuts?
I'll tell you why you didn't help - because you're a chickenshit tweaking snitch. You're a bottom feader, Flynne.
Garcetti, you're teeth, they're fucking perfect.
Danny, it's really pains me to have to tell you this, but do you remember DOMINGO, that wetback you helped us put away for trafficking a few months back?
Yeah. What about him?
Yeah. What about him?
Turns out he's connected.
Turns out he's connected.
To who?
To who?
The Mexicali Boys
The Mexicali Boys
And what does this have to do with me?
He knows somebody ratted him.
What?!
What?!
And he's making a lot of noise about having his homies hang a Colombian necktie on whoever it was.
Fuck you, Garcetti. I been at this for almost a year. I've done everything you guys have asked of me.
Anyone ever ask you to be such a disrespectful smart-ass all the time?
We know what's going on.
I still don't know what you're talking about.
Jimmy?
Who the hell is Jimmy?
Who the hell is Jimmy?
He's the only one I told.
He's the only one I told.
And he probably only told two people and they probably only told four people and on and one. You know better than to tell a secret to a tweaker, Flynne. Might just as well broadcast it on the evening news.
What's on the other end of this thing?
Now that I can help you with. Nasty boy ... goes by the name of Pooh-Bear. He's a chef. Check with Palmdale P.D. I'm sure they're keeping box scores on the guy.
Now that I can help you with. Nasty boy ... goes by the name of Pooh-Bear. He's a chef. Check with Palmdale P.D. I'm sure they're keeping box scores on the guy.
Sounds like you hooked up with some fine citizens, Flynne.
Sounds like you hooked up with some fine citizens, Flynne.
Oh they're all that and the proverbial bag of chips.
What's that smell?
That would be me.
That would be me.
What'd you do, piss your pants?
What'd you do, piss your pants?
Hell, yes! What the hell do you expect zapping Mr. Johnson with that crackler?
Who'd have thought it? Danny "Chickenshit" Flynne trying to go large right under our noses.
Lay off, Garcetti. I'm not in the mood.
Lay off, Garcetti. I'm not in the mood.
No. You've got me all wrong. I mean, in you own pussified way, you actually got some nuts in your little sack.
Excuse me?
Several possession charges, but nothing major.

Why doesn't Palmdale P.D. just raid the guy?
Why doesn't Palmdale P.D. just raid the guy?
They have. But they never found a lab.
You're lucky, Flynne.
Funny, I don't feel lucky.
Funny, I don't feel lucky.
We're coordinating with Palmdale P.D.. We'll have your sorry ass covered.
We're coordinating with Palmdale P.D.. We'll have your sorry ass covered.
What if he caps me before you can make a move?
Speaking of which ... you run that license plate for me?
You mean the menacing red car?
Come on! Who is it? Domingo's boys?
Worse. Much worse. A teacher.
When is the deal going down?
I'm making the small buy tonight ... if I don't get beaten to death with a wheelchair or something. If everyone is happy, we'll do the big deal later in the week.
You know, I'm starting to think I'd rather take my chances with Domingo than go through any more of this shit.
Didn't you hear? Domingo's dead.
Nervous?
With you clowns watching my back? What do you think?
A virtuoso rendition. TOM VAN ALLEN is nothing short of dazzling in his interpretation of Miles Davis' haunting, moody piece.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
And he has a really hot ass with hardly any hair on it.

You, madam, are a heartless wench.
And you've got wiener breath.

Really?
Really?
It's that disgusting hot dog you had for lunch.
Tom, let's spend the night here.
There's no motels around here.
There's no motels around here.
No. Right here on the beach. Come on. Let's do it.
Why didn't you just ask for directions back there?
Come on, where's your pioneer spirit?

You mean like the Donner Party?

Hey, do you think you could eat me if you had to? And if so, which part do you think you would find the most delicious?

Tom, quit fucking around.
Tom, quit fucking around.
Okay, okay. There's a house up there. I'll go ask for directions.
You think that's a good idea?
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
Look at that place. It's creepy.
First you want me to ask for directions, then you don't. Which is it?
I wanted you to ask back there. You know, before you got us lost.
I wanted you to ask back there. You know, before you got us lost.
Just no pleasing you, is there?

Just admit you're wrong.

We all know how much you like hearing that. Okay, Liz, I was wrong. There. You happy?
We all know how much you like hearing that. Okay, Liz, I was wrong. There. You happy?
Quit feeling sorry for yourself, Tom. It gets old.
Quit feeling sorry for yourself, Tom. It gets old.
No. You know what gets old? Being reminded what a loser you are every time you screw up.
No. You know what gets old? Being reminded what a loser you are every time you screw up.
Here it comes, poor Tom.
Here it comes, poor Tom.
But that's okay, Liz, you're the one with the steady job, you pay all the bills. I'm just an unemployed musician. You have every right.
But that's okay, Liz, you're the one with the steady job, you pay all the bills. I'm just an unemployed musician. You have every right.
That is so unfair.
My sentiments exactly.
Why are you doing this?
You thinking what I'm thinking?
Yeah. This could be the one we're looking for.
And believe me, word will get out that you're a pro rat.
That's not good in prison. It's just not good.
Golly, I hadn't thought of that.
Don't we always take good care of you?
She's 57 and she's been teaching third grade for the last 33 years.
Now that's scary!
We're in business.
Good work, Flynne. You're a first-rate rat.
Just make sure you hit the floor when we come in. It could get ugly in there.
Yeah, I'd hate to shoot you by accident.
Where's Bubba?
Maybe he isn't showing.
Danny, listen up. Here's the deal ... my wife's pimp knows a guy who works at Cedars Sinai medical lab. They're getting a very special delivery a week from this Friday.
What is it, drugs?
What is it, drugs?
Better than drugs.
What is that? Rum and coke?
Don't worry about it.
Don't worry about it.
I just want to be straight on the details. Can I taste it?
I just want to be straight on the details. Can I taste it?
No, you can't taste it. It's the fucking lab! Now shut up.
Jesus Jimmy, you at the alpha team.
I thought you were done.
Find a chaplain.
...alright, let me know when.

It was a hard assignment, that's why you got it.

There's a Private James Ryan who parachuted in with the Hundred-and- First near Ramelle. I want you to take a squad up there. If he's alive, bring him back to the beach for debarkation. Take whoever you need, you've got your pick of the company.

He's the last of four brothers, the other three were killed in action. This is straight from the Chief of Staff.

But, sir...I...I...
But, sir...I...I...
Spit it out, Captain.
Spit it out, Captain.
Respectfully, sir, sending men all the way up to Ramelle to save one private doesn't make a fucking, goddamned bit of sense. Sir.
Alright, I'll give you that. Continue.
The numbers don't make sense, sir. His brothers are dead, that's too bad, but they're out of the equation. Sending men up there is bleeding heart crapola from three thousand miles away. One private is simply not worth a squad. Colonel anderson This one is. He's worth a lot more than that. Which is why I'm sending you, you're the best field officer there
Good luck, John.
Thank you, sir.
So, where are you from?
You writin' a book or somethin'?
You writin' a book or somethin'?
As a matter of fact, I am.

Figured.
I'm Jackson. I'm from West Fork, Tennessee. My pappy's a preacher. Him and his two brothers got a ministry, The Blessed Church of the Wandering Gospel.

We got us a tent, forty-two feet across, eighteen feet at center, hundred-and-ten foldin' chairs. Circuit's eleven towns, covers all 'a Hasset County and most 'a Weller County. I expect that upon completion of my military service I will be joinin' said ministry.

What about the Captain? Where's he from?
Thirty-ought-six, Norton long-barrel with dual-groove, parallel rifling, elevated three-glass scope and a single-throw hammer.
The Army gave you that?
The Army gave you that?
Yep.
Yep.
You must be a hell a shot.
You must be a hell a shot.
Not where I come from.
That must be four thousand yards.
Forty-two-hundred, I figure.
Forty-two-hundred, I figure.
You take account of the wind?
Did you see what he did, back there? He stepped right into the open, so I could get across.
Shit, that was no big deal.
Jackson?
Hell, no, last time I shot a corporal, Cap'n Miller near bit my head off.
No one's gonna win the money for the simple reason that the Captain never was a civilian. They assembled him at O.C.S. out of spare body parts from dead G.I.'s. I know this for a fact.
You got somethin' against the Cap'n?
You got somethin' against the Cap'n?
Hell, no. I think he's the best officer in the whole goddamned army, bar none.
If we find Ryan and he's still alive, that son-of-a-bitch is gonna carry this goddamned B.A.R. back to the beach for me.
Army life is too dang easy, my feet have gone soft. Back home, we go out squirrel huntin', I walk forever and a day and then some, don't even raise a blister.
Army life is too dang easy, my feet have gone soft. Back home, we go out squirrel huntin', I walk forever and a day and then some, don't even raise a blister.
You know what a B.A.R. weighs? Nineteen and a half pounds, not counting ammo. And you think these things are comfortable? They may look good but they weigh twelve pounds each, that's thirty-six pounds, right there.
Reiben, how many time I got to tell you, I'm from Tennessee.
They got squirrels there, too, right?
Last I knew.
Wade, Sarge, Corporal Insect, all of us, hell, I'll bet even the Captain has a mother.
Fuck Private James Ryan, fuck him, just fuck the goddamned son-of-a- bitch.
Shut up, will you?
Shut up, will you?
You shut up, this is the most fucked up mission I ever heard of. Goddamned Ryan, fuck the little bastard.
You shut up, this is the most fucked up mission I ever heard of. Goddamned Ryan, fuck the little bastard.
Just shut up, Ryan didn't kill Wade.
Just shut up, Ryan didn't kill Wade.
The hell he didn't.
You know what the best possible thing that could happen is?
Yep, you step on a rusty nail, get lockjaw, never say another word as long as you live.
So, that's Ryan.
Looks like a flaming asshole to me.
He's right, we can't shoot him...well, we could but we'd get in an enormous amount of trouble. And he's right about the bridge, it's a hell of a lot more important than he is.
Cap'n...?
Yes, sir.
Of course, sir.
Y'all come back.
Reiben, are you makin' fun 'a the way I talk?
Reiben, are you makin' fun 'a the way I talk?
Hell, no!
What do you think?
I think I'm we got that eighty-eight.
I think I'm we got that eighty-eight.
I mean, Ryan, what do you think of him?
He ain't half-bad, I guess.
I guess.
He ain't Wade.
Nope, he ain't Wade.
Well, I'll be goddamned, I knew it.
Like hell, you did.
No kiddin'?
What deal?
Me? I'm walking with my hound, Lucy, it's about an hour 'fore sunrise and we're out huntin' coon. I got me a flask of pure Kentucky mash whiskey...
Jackson, how many times I got to tell you, you're from Tennessee.
Jackson, how many times I got to tell you, you're from Tennessee.
I am, but I like imported whiskey. So there I am and I hear the biggest ole' coon you ever did hear, 'a rustlin' right there in front of me. That ole' boy comes right out of the brush, I got a clear shot and he knows he's 'bout to meet his maker. I aim, I got my finger tight on the trigger and
Captain, my feet are most uncomfortable. If I'd 'a known we was gonna have to walk all the way to Ramelle, I never would 'a volunteered for this here mission.
You didn't volunteer, Jackson.
You didn't volunteer, Jackson.
I most likely would have, sir, had I been given the opportunity.
Sir, I have an opinion on this matter.
I'd love to hear it.
I'd love to hear it.
Seems to me, Cap'n, this mission is a serious misallocation of valuable military resources. Miller Go on.
Reiben, I want you to listen closely to Jackson. This is the way to gripe. Jackson, continue.
Yes, sir. It seems to me, sir, that the entire resources of the United States Army oughta be dedicated to one thing and one thing only, and that is to put me and this here weapon on a rooftop, smack-dab in the middle of Berlin, Germany. Now I ain't one to question decisions made up on high, sir, but it seems to me that

Wade?
Where?
In the shadow by those two trees.
In the shadow by those two trees.
My guess, too.
We left them eighty-eights.
They don't send planes to put out machine guns. Two flank runners with surpressing fire. I'm going right, whoever goes left has to be fast.
Watching.
Gives Wade the second shot.
What the hell's the matter with you, Jackson?
Sir, I ain't feeling so chipper on account of Wade.
Sir, I ain't feeling so chipper on account of Wade.
Who's Wade?
Sir, I understand what you're doin', but I respectfully request permission to grieve in my own manner.
You'll grieve the way I tell you to goddamned grieve. There is no Wade, there was one, but he died a long time ago, he's been dead for so long you can hardly remember his name, you understand?
You'll grieve the way I tell you to goddamned grieve. There is no Wade, there was one, but he died a long time ago, he's been dead for so long you can hardly remember his name, you understand?
Sir, I understand. I don't like it, but I understand.
Sir, I understand. I don't like it, but I understand.
Good, now get your goddamned gear.
Not yet.
Keep trying.
I'm in my backyard, lying in my hammock, with my arm around my wife, listening for the sound of breaking glass.
Say what, Cap'n?
Say what, Cap'n?
You see, I've got the best house in all of Addley. It's not the biggest house, but it's got the best location, right next to the junior high baseball field. The garage windows face left field. The guy who owned the house before me had these heavy screen S put over them. The first thing I did when I bought the place was take

Don't that get kind of expensive, Cap'n?
Don't that get kind of expensive, Cap'n?
It's worth it.
It's worth it.
To each, his own.
Sorry, sir, fresh out of trucks, how 'bout a '38 Ford Roadster, hard-top, red with black interior.
White-walls?
White-walls?
No white-walls, sir, there's a war on. NOT THERE, YOU GODDAMNED IDIOT, OVER THERE! I can't help you, sir.
No white-walls, sir, there's a war on. NOT THERE, YOU GODDAMNED IDIOT, OVER THERE! I can't help you, sir.
A half-track, anything.
A half-track, anything.
Sorry, sir. Division is using everything on wheels to get up to Caen. How come you guys aren't going?
How about that jeep?
That's General Gavin's. His lap dog told me if anyone breathes on it, I'll get busted and if anyone so much as touches it with their little finger, I'll get court marshaled. If you were to take it, they'd shoot me.
A paratrooper named Ryan. He's going home, if he's alive.
Senator's son?
Senator's son?
No, three brothers of his were killed in action. Command wants him out of there.
I know about bracketing. I read about it. The next one is going to land right on us.
FORWARD! FORWARD! NOW REVERSE!
You can tell all that, just by the sound, sire?
That's not all. There were nine gunners on the eighty-eights, one had a broken heel on his boot, two had bratwurst for supper last night, one of them is named Fritz, the other, Hans, maybe, I don't know, it's hard to tell.
Glad of it.
On the other side of the street, crouches in a doorway with Jackson. Upham is a bit in shock, less from the nearness of the bullets than from what Miller just did for him.

DASHES across the street.
Sir, I'm sorry about what happened, I...
It was nothing.
It was nothing.
But you could have gotten killed and I...
But you could have gotten killed and I...
Like I said, it was nothing. Don't bunch up.
Upham?
Pass.
Pass.
Sarge?
I wasn't made for this.
You think the rest of us were?
It looks like a Renoir.
Yes. Do you know Sibelius' Fourth Symphony, The Normandy?
Yes. Do you know Sibelius' Fourth Symphony, The Normandy?
I've been humming it.
I've been humming it.
I heard.
I heard.
It seemed appropriate.
It seemed appropriate.
You know classical music?
You know classical music?
Some.
Some.
Where are you from, Captain?
Over three-hundred.
I'll tell you what, if I'm still alive when it hits five-hundred, I'll let you know and we'll split the money.
I'll tell you what, if I'm still alive when it hits five-hundred, I'll let you know and we'll split the money.
If that's the way you feel, why don't we wait until it's up to a thousand.
If that's the way you feel, why don't we wait until it's up to a thousand.
I don't expect to live that long.
Five nights ago, he found this paratrooper caught in a tree with a broken leg. The leg got infected. Last night he went to Ville Cholet to get a doctor. The doctor refused to come and when he got back, this is what he found. The Krauts must have shown up while he was gone.
Did he see any sign of them?
No, but he heard firing, just east, less that a kilometer.
Thank him and tell him we're sorry about his loss.
What is it?
A machine gun.
Good luck, Captain.
Don't need it, I'm a cat, I've got five lives.
Don't need it, I'm a cat, I've got five lives.
The men said, nine.
The men said, nine.
What do they know? I had nine, but I feel through the ice when I was seven, my brother pulled me out. Then I used one when a grenade landed in my foxhole in Sicily, it was a dud. I figure one on the beaches, one on the cliffs and two getting here.

That only leaves three.
That only leaves three.
Plenty.
I wonder where they're going.
Same place we are.
I'd like to stay, too, Captain.
You don't count.
I can tell what the gunners had for dinner.
Those guns are close.
What about our grenades?
Those are Tigers, they have six-inch armor, they don't even notice grenades.
Those are Tigers, they have six-inch armor, they don't even notice grenades.
Would they notice and eighty-eight?
Would they notice and eighty-eight?
Sure, you got one?
Sure, you got one?
The Germans do.
Upham, you've got to learn the difference between whining and griping. You can't just rely on natural ability, you've got to study and practice.
But, sir...
But, sir...
There you go again, that's whining, that's not okay.
There you go again, that's whining, that's not okay.
Goddamn it, sir...
Goddamn it, sir...
That's better, but you've still got a long way to go. Talk to Reiben, he's a natural and works at it, he'll give you some pointers.
What'd you say, Captain?
I teach English at Addley High School in Addley, Pennsylvania.
Captain, what about our deal?
I changed my mind.
GO!
Rolls his eyes, takes a breath. Scrambles into the gap. The other five right behind.
CAPTAIN, IF YOUR MOTHER SAW YOU DO THAT, SHE'D BE VERY UPSET!
I THOUGHT YOU WERE MY MOTHER.
Worked, didn't it?
You tryin' to get yourself killed?
You tryin' to get yourself killed?
Don't need to, the Krauts go that covered.
Caen?
I wish. You and I are taking a squad up to Ramelle on a public relations mission.

Simpson.

I want Reiben on B.A.R; Jackson with his sniper rifle; Beasley, demolition.

Beasley's dead.
Beasley's dead.
Okay, Wade. Translators?
Okay, Wade. Translators?
Fresh out.
Fresh out.
What about Talbot?
What about Talbot?
Twenty minutes ago. Miller Damn, I'll go see if I can find another one. You get Reiben, Jackson and Wade, meet me at transport.
You get a translator, Captain?
I've got a line on one.
Now we've got a straight shot, due north, to Ramelle, twenty-six miles, two villages between here and there, St. Mere, then Bernay. We'll take the jeep as far as we can, then go on on foot.
We in radio contact with anybody up there?
We in radio contact with anybody up there?
Somebody put the wrong crystals in every one of the Hundred-and-First's radios the night before the drop, not one of them works. We're going in blind.
A fucking mess, two maybe three Kraut divisions, no fronts, no lines, the drops were completely fouled up, we've got little pockets of paratroopers all over the place, trying to hang on. Command says we hold St. Mere, but north of that, it's all Krauts. Even if Ryan's where he's supposed to be, he's more than likely dead.
Hell of a mission.
Hell of a mission.
Yep, hell of a mission.
Uh, Captain...
PUSH!
PUSH!
Uh, Captain...
Got it, sir. We gonna go take care of those eighty-eights?
That's not what we're here for.
He's right, Captain, it might be kind of dangerous for those flyboys.
Tell that to Private James Ryan. We've got our orders. Let's go.
You ever going to open those letters? Miller keeps his eyes on the maps.
Maybe.
Maybe.
It's not normal, not reading letters from home.
It's not normal, not reading letters from home.
Since when have things been normal?

You got me. Afraid of bad news?

Nope.
Nope.
Good news?
You think they'll be alright?
They're fine. As long as they can gripe, they'll be alright.
They're fine. As long as they can gripe, they'll be alright.
And what about you?
They guys here aren't going to be able to hold out until battalion shows up.
Nope.
Nope.
Command isn't going to let them withdraw and the Germans sure as hell aren't going to let them surrender.
Command isn't going to let them withdraw and the Germans sure as hell aren't going to let them surrender.
Three for three.

If we stayed, we could make a difference.
If we stayed, we could make a difference.
You're kidding yourself.
You're kidding yourself.
You never know.
I hope this boy Ryan is worth it.
Now you're the one kidding yourself. Hell of a mission.
Now you're the one kidding yourself. Hell of a mission.
Yup, hell of a mission.
Makes you feel small, doesn't it?
It doesn't take this.
A couple of weeks. It started in Portsmouth when they brought us down for loading.
Is it getting worse?
Is it getting worse?
No. It comes and goes. It stops when I look at it.
No. It comes and goes. It stops when I look at it.
You may have to find yourself a new line of work, this one doesn't seem to agree with you anymore.
You may have to find yourself a new line of work, this one doesn't seem to agree with you anymore.
I'll be alright.
Yeah? What rule of thumb is that?
How about I go right, sir?
How about I go right, sir?
How about you take your position?
How about...?
How about you shut up and take your position?
HOLD YOUR FIRE!
Rolls to his feet. FIRE another BURST. KILLS the last of the German riflemen. Doesn't pause. RUNS onto the field.
Pulls Wade's hands from the wound. Pours sulfa powder.
About to pour his sulfa. Sees the wound. Stops. Knows it's fatal.
SHOVES THE NEEDLE into Wade's neck. Thick vein. Pumps the morphine straight to Wade's brain. Motions impatiently to Sarge.
More morphine, hurry up, come on, come on...
More morphine, hurry up, come on, come on...
Hesitates. Then drops his sulfa. Fumbles in his pack. Finds the morphine.
Hesitates. Then drops his sulfa. Fumbles in his pack. Finds the morphine.
Snatches the morphine from Sarge. Quickly and efficiently prepares a second shot. He's done this before.
You alright?
Let's just find someplace.
What was the name of that kid at Anzio, the one who got his face burned off?
Vecchio.
Vecchio.
Yeah, Vecchio, I couldn't remember his name, he was a good kid, remember how he used to walk on his hands and sing that song about the man on flying trapeze?
Yeah, Vecchio, I couldn't remember his name, he was a good kid, remember how he used to walk on his hands and sing that song about the man on flying trapeze?
Yeah.
Yeah.
You know why I'm such a good officer? Because of my mother. Have I ever told you about her?
You know why I'm such a good officer? Because of my mother. Have I ever told you about her?
Bits and pieces.
Bits and pieces.
She's the best poker player you ever saw. My father used to go to these Saturday night games and lose his shirt. Finally, my mother gave him an ultimatum, either she gets a regular seat at the table or she locks him in every Saturday night. He squawked and so did his buddies but after a while they gave in and from the first

And what about your own hand?
And what about your own hand?
No problem. A pair of deuces? Less? So what? I bluff. It used to tear me apart when I'd get one of my men killed, but what was I supposed to do? Break down in front of the ones who were standing there waiting for me to tell them what to do? Of course not, so I bluffed, and after a while, I started

It could be worse. You know the first thing they teach you at O.C.S.? Lie to your men.
It could be worse. You know the first thing they teach you at O.C.S.? Lie to your men.
Oh, yeah?
Oh, yeah?
Not in so many words, but they tell you you can have all the firepower in the world and if your men don't have good morale, it's not worth a damn. So if you're scared or empty or half-a-step from a Section Eight, do you tell your men? Of course not. You bluff, you lie.

And how do you bluff yourself?
And how do you bluff yourself?
Simple, numbers. Every time you kill one of your men, you tell yourself you just saved the lives of two, three, ten, a hundred others. We lost, what, thirty-one on the cliffs? I'll bet we saved ten times that number by putting out those guns. That's over three hundred men. Maybe five hundred. A thousand. Then thousand. Any number you want. See? It's simple.

That's the rub. I liked Wade. Who's Ryan? If they're both standing in front of me and I have to shoot one or the other, how do I choose? Look at my hand, there it goes again.
That's the rub. I liked Wade. Who's Ryan? If they're both standing in front of me and I have to shoot one or the other, how do I choose? Look at my hand, there it goes again.
John, I've got to tell you, I think you're about used up.
John, I've got to tell you, I think you're about used up.
I think you're right, Keith.
I think you're right, Keith.
You want me to take over?
No, but if I get any worse, you'll have to relieve me.
Just what I want to do.
You know Wade was the eleventh of the twelve, you're the last one still alive.
I know.
I know.
Don't let yourself get killed, if you do, they might make me give back the medal and then I won't be able to lip off to colonels anymore.
Don't let yourself get killed, if you do, they might make me give back the medal and then I won't be able to lip off to colonels anymore.
I'll do my best.
Thanks for drawing that machine gun off me.
You're welcome, John.
You're welcome, John.
But, that's my personal brand of stupidity, I feel kind of proprietary about it, if you do it again, you're busted.
Sarge, see what you can do to make those buildings inhospitable.
Yes, sir.
What do you think?
Well, if we had ten times the men and a lot more ammo, we might stand a chance, but not against those tanks.
Well, if we had ten times the men and a lot more ammo, we might stand a chance, but not against those tanks.
What are we going to do?
What are we going to do?
We're going to hope like hell the tanks were on their way somewhere else.
Uh, oh.
Out of the mouth of babes.
Reiben, I don't know what I'd do without you. Sarge, keep Ryan close to you and alive.
Yes, sir.
Captain, can I put in for a transfer?
Sure, meet me at the top, we'll start the paperwork.
Sir, what if they send some other company into Caen ahead of us while we're pinned down here?
Don't worry, we're the only Rangers this side of the continent, we've got to be first into Caen.
So, you ever heard of employee discounts? My uncle sells shoes, gets twenty-five percent off everything in the line, got a closet filled with the best looking shoes you ever seen.
Just picture some French number been spending all day, every day, making cream-colored, shear-body negligees with gentle-lift silk cups and gathered empire waists, what the hell you think she wears at night?

Reiben, how the hell do you know so much about lingerie?
Reiben, how the hell do you know so much about lingerie?
Lingerie is my life, sir. My mother's got a shop in Brooklyn, I grew up in it, from the time I could crawl, we carry Caen lingerie, it's the best there is, it's all I been thinking about since the invasion.
There's a war on, good chance they're not still making lingerie in Caen.
Oh, Captain, they'll always make lingerie, it's one of the three basic needs of man -- food, shelter, silk teddies. Miller Dream on, private.
I don't think so, Captain.
Stay at it until you get fire control. Keep 'em down, wait for the navy.
Strides through the chaos, avoiding the passing vehicles. He sees his men and walks toward them. Reiben hurries up to Miller, pleading.
Please, sir, you can't take me to Ramelle, I gotta go to Caen, sir, please, I told you, they make Caen lingerie there, it's beautiful, it's the best there is, it's...oh, please, sir...
Please, sir, you can't take me to Ramelle, I gotta go to Caen, sir, please, I told you, they make Caen lingerie there, it's beautiful, it's the best there is, it's...oh, please, sir...
Sorry, I need a B.A.R. man, you're the best.
Sorry, I need a B.A.R. man, you're the best.
No, I'm not, Kaback is, honest. Or what about Faulkner? Or that little guy with the glasses?
No, I'm not, Kaback is, honest. Or what about Faulkner? Or that little guy with the glasses?
Trust me, you're the best.
Trust me, you're the best.
But, sir...
Captain, can I ask you a question?
Sure, Reiben.
Sure, Reiben.
Where are you planning on putting Private Ryan, sir?
Captain, I gotta tell you, the irony of this mission is fucking killing me.
Yeah, how so?
Yeah, how so?
I should be on my way to Caen, sir. It's like Beethoven, the guy's one of the greatest composers ever lived and he goes deaf. Go figure, I mean, who'd he piss off? And here I am, the Beethoven of ladies foundation garments, one step away from Caen, the center of the known lingerie universe and instead, I'm going to Ramelle to save some

There's to be a bright side, look for it.
There's to be a bright side, look for it.
Sir, you know what Ramelle is famous for? Cheese. The rest of the company is going to Caen and we're going to the goddamned cheese capital of France. There is no bright side.

There's always a bright side.
I'm listening, sir.
I'm listening, sir.
Well, I, for one, like cheese.
General Gavin is going to be very irritated at you, Captain.
Stands on the edge of the woods, almost in a trance.
Jesus Christ, he's a natural!
Upham, are you sure you've never been in combat?
Captain, could you please explain the math of this mission to me?
Sure, what do you want to know?
Sure, what do you want to know?
Well, sir, in purely arithmetic terms, since when does six equal one? What's the sense in risking six guys to save one?
Well, sir, in purely arithmetic terms, since when does six equal one? What's the sense in risking six guys to save one?
Ours is not to reason why.

Huh?

Never mind, don't worry, we'll pick up this kid, high-tail it back to division, everything'll work out fine.

I'd much rather die in Caen than Ramelle, sir. It's a personal thing.
I'd much rather die in Caen than Ramelle, sir. It's a personal thing.
Reiben, there's a fairly good chance you're not going to die at all.
Reiben, there's a fairly good chance you're not going to die at all.
Easy for you to say, sir. Fucking James Ryan, I'd like to wring his fucking neck.
Well, maybe not the Captain, but the rest of us have mothers.
You have orders, too.
Reiben, what's the matter with you? I don't gripe to you. I'm a captain. There's a chain of command. Griping goes one way, up, only up, never down. You gripe to me, I gripe to my superior officers. Up, get it? I don't gripe to you, I don't gripe in front of you. How long you been in the army?
I'm sorry, sir, I apologize. But if you weren't a captain, or if I were a major, what would you say?
In addition, as I pointed out earlier, I have a fondness for cheese and I hope to have the opportunity to sample some of the Ramelle products, when we arrive there, to see if they live up to their excellent reputation. Moreover, I feel heartfelt sorrow for the mother of Private James Ryan and I'm more than willing to lay down my life, and
Sir, if you were not a captain, I would compliment you, now, for being an excellent liar.
Sir, if you were not a captain, I would compliment you, now, for being an excellent liar.
But I am a captain. If I were not a captain, I would thank you for the compliment and tell you that the ability to lie comes from being a top-notch poker player, which I am, having learned at the side of my mother who is, by popular acclaim, the best poker player in...
Any further thoughts on the subject?
Yes, sir, as a final note, I'd like to say, fuck our orders, fuck Ramelle, fuck the cheese capital of France and while we're at it, fuck Private James Ryan.
Yes, sir, as a final note, I'd like to say, fuck our orders, fuck Ramelle, fuck the cheese capital of France and while we're at it, fuck Private James Ryan.
I'll make a note of your suggestions but I'll leave that last one to you, especially if he's already dead.
Sir, I've got an idea, let's go around.
We can't leave it here.
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
Is silent. Motionless. He gently closes Wade's eyes. His hand quivers slightly as he unclips one of Wades dogtags. He fumbles and drops it. Sarge notices.
Up. We're moving out.
I thought you said we had an hour, sir?
I thought you said we had an hour, sir?
Well now I'm saying we're moving out. Get off your ass.
I've given this a lot of thought, sir. The best thing that could happen is, we find Ryan and he's dead.
Why's that?
Why's that?
Well, sir, consider the possibilities. A: Ryan is alive. We have to take him back to the beach. Knowing you, you don't let him carry my gear, even though he really should, and we all get killed, trying to keep him alive.

Except for the last part, that one's not bad.
B: Ryan is dead. He's been blown up by the German equivalent of Wade, whose name I know you don't want me to mention. There's nothing to find. The biggest piece is the size of a pea. We wander around, looking for him until the Germans pick us off, one after another.

I don't like that one.
I don't like that one.
Neither do I, sir. C: And this is the worst one, we find Ryan and he's wounded. Not only does he not carry my gear, we have to carry his gear. And him.

But we accomplish the mission.
But we accomplish the mission.
Maybe. But what if he dies on the way back? you see what I'm saying, sir? The best possible situation is, he's dead, we find his body, more or less intact, we grab one of his dog-tags and high-tail it back to the beach, or better yet, we head over to Caen and catch up with division.

Has anyone ever told you, you're officer material?
Has anyone ever told you, you're officer material?
No, sir.
No, sir.
That's a mystery to me.
Scans the Germans with his binoculars.
Looks like tea time, maybe they're Brits.
Looks like they've been having a hell of a party, here, Captain.
ON THE BRIDGE! WE'RE COMING IN.
I HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA. HERE WE COME. Cover me.
What if our guys open up, sir?
What if our guys open up, sir?
You're only allowed to shoot at Germans, that's one of the rules.
You're only allowed to shoot at Germans, that's one of the rules.
Have it your way, Captain.
Yes, sir, of course, sir, I was merely speaking hypothetically. IF this was a voting situation, then the vote would have been unanimous. But of course, it's not a voting situation, you're the captain, and you give the orders, sir.
You're goddamned right, I give the order. Vote! Jesus Christ! Listen to me, you little pissant pieces of shit, I am the ranking officer here and what I say goes, is that clear?
Maybe Caen.
Let's hope, because we're sure as hell not going to do any damage to them with what we have here.
Leave him to me, Captain, I'll have him pissing and moaning with the best of us.
See to it.
Cocks his Thompson. Settles down behind some sandbags.
HERE THEY COME!
HERE THEY COME!
OPENS UP with the MACHINE GUN.
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
Get back to your positions!
What deal?
I coach the baseball team, too.
I wonder if his cabin is still available?
That's not where I am. Miller No? Where are you?
Hears the FAINT DISTANT RUMBLE OF THE TANK. Barely has time to react. Sees:
Here they come.
Here they come.
FIRES a burst. Germans drops.
FIRES a burst. Germans drops.
FIRES a burst. More Germans drop.
Continues FIRING. CUTTING DOWN the advancing Germans.
Knows what that means. He hears the RUMBLE OF THE TANKS.
Goddamn it!
More tanks... Ryan Lot's of them The fear on their faces turns to resignation. They know that they are dead men. They settle into their positions, and prepare to fire and die.
Private. I'm sorry about your brothers but staying here and getting yourself killed isn't going to help.
Sir, if the Krauts are holding this bridge when division shows up, our guys are going to be sitting ducks.
Sir, if the Krauts are holding this bridge when division shows up, our guys are going to be sitting ducks.
This bridge cannot be held. The Germans have two companies less than three miles from here. They have tanks.
The hell you aren't, you're comin' with me if I have to drag you every inch of the way. You hear me, Private?
I hear you sir, but I'm not leaving.
Thank you, sir.
Yeah, yeah. I want you right next to me, no matter where I go, you understand?
Yes, sir.
Alright, come with me.
I'd like to go, sir.
No, private, I want you to stay here, keep your head down, don't do anything brave or stupid.
Don't do that again.
I won't need to sir, it's already here, behind the barricade so...
You set? Sarge nods.
Yes, sir.
Is jumped on by one. Upham FIRES. KILLS the German.
Struggling with a pair of Germans.
Doesn't move. He just stares at Sarge's body.
Looks at Miller, sees him growing weak, starting to sway. He gently tries to move Miller aside.
FIRES THE EIGHTY-EIGHT.
Races through the debris. Trailed by BULLETS.
Yes, Private.
Upham and Jackson, what were they like?
Upham and Jackson, what were they like?
Upham? Good kid, smart, he was writing a book.
Upham? Good kid, smart, he was writing a book.
Yeah?
Jackson was from West Fork, Tennessee, he was going to be a preacher, his father and uncles have a traveling ministry out of the back of a stretch Hudson.
And Sarge?
And Sarge?
Sarge? He was the best friend I ever had. Lemme tell you about Sarge...
So what? I've got three satchel charges, six gammon grenades, a dozen- and-a-half pineapples, and all my regular gear. You don't hear me complaining.
That's because, as I have pointed out on numerous occasions, you are a happy idiot.
That's because, as I have pointed out on numerous occasions, you are a happy idiot.
No, I just happen to take the Captain's advice and look at the bright side of things.
Oh, Christ, now we gotta listen to that grandfather thing again.
As I was saying, before I was so rudely interrupted, my grandfather got old, as grandfathers tend to do. He needed someone to take care of him. We move around all the time, going from one mine to another, so we had to put him in a home. Nice enough place but kind of depressing. But not for Granddad. He just convinced himself he
Fine, you convince yourself you got a pack full of feathers and goddamned Private James Ryan can carry my fucking gear.
Reiben, you can be very unpleasant to be around sometimes.
Reiben, you can be very unpleasant to be around sometimes.
You want unpleasant? Just wait, I can do much better than this.
You want unpleasant? Just wait, I can do much better than this.
Look at Upham, you don't hear him complaining.
Wade's right, it's some kind of scientific, magnetic thing, I can't explain it, but I've seen it.
We all have, he's got nine lives, or he's bulletproof, or some damn thing.
Hell, I don't mind this mission, sir, as long as there's something up at Ramelle for...
...for you to blow up, yeah, yeah, we heard that.
Shit, sir.
Fertilizer, Captain, I think we're in a cranberry bog.
Fertilizer, Captain, I think we're in a cranberry bog.
Out of the frying pan, into the fucking latrine.
Who cares?
I care. Don't you know what Caen's famous for, Sarge?
I care. Don't you know what Caen's famous for, Sarge?
Frogs?
Frogs?
Lingerie.
Lingerie.
Yeah? So?
I usually like surprises.
What are we likely to run into?
Damn fool. Sir.
Captain, he's fast!
Jesus, Reiben, think of the poor bastard's mother.
Hey, I got a mother. Jackson, you got a mother?
So, where are you from?
Get lost.
But everybody's heard of him, he won the Congressional Medal of Honor, he saved a dozen men.
We know.
We know.
Somebody must know where he's from, what he did for a living.
Sir, I ran the 220 in high school.
He's fast, Captain, I saw him.
On guard, glancing back. Pissed off.
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
Freaked out. Trying to keep his eyes on the perimeter. Can't.
I don't know, I kind of like Wade's idea about the cruise ship. I've never been to Tahiti.
What about you, Captain?
Demolition, right?
Since I was nine years old. They got a lot of explosives around mines. Me and my little brother could get into any warehouse you ever saw. Damn, we had fun!
How do you do it?
It's easy, it runs in my family, take my grandfather, for example...
You think he really believed it?
Who knows? It worked.
How fast?
Twenty-four-five.
Twenty-four-five.
Shit, that's nothing, I ran twenty- two flat.
I'm supposed to be leaving on a fellowship that I worked for my entire life. I don't even care. I met this boy over the summer, and I, I can't see him because of this, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to my father about... I wore these clothes, I thought, I thought that if I looked right and if I acted
We believe that your father operates in a large pool of cash that comes from phoney billings, phoney patients. We've been investigating him for five years. We believe that when they die, he takes their money.

Well, take a look around the house. Is everything nice, but not too nice? Are there lots of, uh, rugs, pieces of art, stereo equipment, uh, furniture, a lot of things bought with cash? Does he give a lot of gifts? Do the major items in your house cover around the nine thousand-dollar range?

Taking care of people isn't a growth enterprise, Mr Sims. I hope you write that down in your report, I'd like your bosses to read it.
Hi.
Is it a gift for your wife? Are you getting a set together?

Yeah, I don't want it. Um, thank you very much. You're very kind.
Lloyd?
Hey, sis.
Hey, sis.
I'm sorry. Sam had to do a new crown, we had [?], and Jason had a sore throat. Your big graduation, and no one was there.
It's no problem. I called Mom and Dad in Germany; it's like they were there.
I hope you understand.
I hope you understand.
Hey, bad throat, huh J-man?
Why do you eat that stuff? There's no food in your food. Not too loud, the red line's there for a reason.
How do you know how to draw the red line anyway?
How do you know how to draw the red line anyway?
Because it's loud enough so the neighbors don't complain, that's how come I know.
Because it's loud enough so the neighbors don't complain, that's how come I know.
Good thing there's not a red line on you, J-man. YEAH!
Why can't you be his uncle and not his playmate?

Jesus Christ. I get in a good mood. How hard is it just to decide to be in a good mood, and then be in a good mood?
Gee, it's easy.
Gee, it's easy.
Look, I'm really sorry that Mom and Dad made you take me in. Really. If it's such a big deal, I'll go. But remember this, it used to be fun. It used to be warped, twisted and hilarious, and I mean that in the best possible way, I mean it as a compliment. I mean, I'm sorry T-I-M left you. But I am not

Yeah.
Yeah.
I still am.
You're tough, J-man.
He's a mess!
I'll be in my office.
I just washed this shirt, didn't I?
No, no, don't go in there.
Forget it, forget it, it's mine, it's mine!
Hello Constance. It's me, Lloyd... nothing, I'm just driving around... she broke up with me... what do I do? Can't she come back? How can I get her back?... I can't think, talk to me... I fucked up... I feel like crying... she gave me a pen. I gave her my heart and she gave me a pen.
Lloyd, honey, just come home, okay?
Lloyd, honey, just come home, okay?
I'll be home soon.

What's a scam?

Going out as friends.
Then what's love?
I'm gonna call her.
I'm gonna call her.
Diane Court doesn't go out with guys like you. She's a brain.
Sounds great to me, I'm going to call her, that's what's cool about her.
Brains stay with brains. The bomb could go off and their mutant genes would form the same cliques.
Look at those eyes.
Lloyd, give it up.
Lloyd, give it up.
Do me a favor; take a picture of me with her.

Please? COREY Alright. Alright, Okay, here.
Wait for me for when I get round to the front.
Okay, I got it.
You are such a great person Lloyd. I'm a good person, but you are a great person.
Hang in there, man.
Hang in there, man.
Yes.
Yes.
See you tomorrow.
See you tomorrow.
See you. Bye. Bye Diane.
Did you sleep with her?
I admit nothing.
Alright, alright, alright, calm down, alright, calm down. Nothing's different.
Lloyd, listen to me. EVERYTHING has changed. You've had sex. No matter what you might think, nothing will ever be the same between you two. You might be sixty. You might be walking down the street, and you'll talk to her about something, whatever. But what you'll really be thinking is 'We had sex'.

So, what's your point?
So, what's your point?
You've got to do something special. You've got to make a statement.
Alright.
Lloyd, send her flowers, write her a letter. Something.
Lloyd, send her flowers, write her a letter. Something.
I already did.
What does it say?
Read it.
I draw the line at seven un-returned phone calls.
Lloyd, you have to understand her family is being ripped apart. Like you and she were ripped apart. Like Joe and I were ripped apart.
No, you're not a guy.
I am.
I am.
The world is full of guys. Be a man. Don't be a guy.
The world is full of guys. Be a man. Don't be a guy.
If she wants me, she can come to me.
I don't feel anything.
Come on, it's graduation.
Come on, it's graduation.
Did you see what Mr Carroll wrote in my yearbook? Well, he ridiculed me all year long, and then he writes, "You're a real live-wire, Love Mr Carroll." Y'know, it's all so phoney.

Well, where Mr Carroll uses the word 'love', I look for a new word.
Trapped in the body of a gameshow hostess.
Diane Court does not realise how good-looking she is.
I wouldn't get my hopes up Lloyd.
I'm sorry. It's just you're a really nice guy, and we don't want to see you get hurt.
Lloyd is doomed.
Meaning?
Meaning?
Meaning that she made the second date a family audition, which is the kiss of death for Lloyd.
I told him to be himself.
He's got that nervous talking thing. I told him not to speak.
Lloyd, it's us.
Look at his face, he did the deed.
Look at his face, he did the deed.
You're an inspiration Lloyd; you should go on the seven hundred club or something.
Wait a minute.
You've got to show her respect, you've got to show her that you're not like Joe...

I've forgotten what I was going to say... okay, okay, I remember. Let him do what he wants.
"Dear Diane, I'll always be there for you, all the love in my heart, Lloyd." I've never gotten a letter like this, have you?
I dream about it.
I wrote sixty-three songs this year. They're all about Joe, and I'm going to play every single one of them tonight.
I just saw Joe. He's here.
I just saw Joe. He's here.
Well, you don't have to be so dramatic about it.
Why?
It's too much pressure, it's not his crowd.
It's too much pressure, it's not his crowd.
What is wrong with this girl?
Hey, I know this is a strange thing to say, but maybe Diane Court really likes Lloyd.
If you were Diane Court, would you honestly fall for Lloyd?
I can't give you that. This guy's been ripping off grandma and grandpa for seventeen years. He's been getting it from every end. I'd love to hear his story.
One hundred thousand dollar fine and three months?

Alright.
Lloyd, she's being difficult.
I'm going to take out Diane Court again.
That was a mistake. The rain on my car is a baptism. The new me. Iceman, power Lloyd. My assault on the world begins now. Believe in myself, answer to no one... You probably got it all figured out, Corey. If you start out depressed, everything's kind of a pleasant surprise.
Look, why don't you just call Diane again?
Visit her at the home.
I'm not going back there. I don't even know who you're talking about.
I'm not going back there. I don't even know who you're talking about.
Lloyd, why do you have to be like this?
Lloyd, why do you have to be like this?
'Cause I'm a guy, I have pride.
Well, it's almost over. We've gone to school together for three years... I might cut that part out.
Why? It's fine. It's nice.
Having taken a few courses at the university this year, I have glimpsed our future, and all I can say is... go back.
Ha! Go back! What a great line!
Ha! Go back! What a great line!
You like it?
You like it?
Oh yeah!
Oh yeah!
I didn't think anyone would get it.
I didn't think anyone would get it.
Oh no, no, it's... it's wonderful. It's... no, don't worry about it. You're very funny. Go back, that's great!
Oh no, no, it's... it's wonderful. It's... no, don't worry about it. You're very funny. Go back, that's great!
Alright, no more, I'm going to save it.
Alright, no more, I'm going to save it.
Okay.
Ha!
Well, it's almost over. We've gone to school together for three years, and we've been through a lot. But with that training out of High School gone, what's going to happen to us? We all know what the answers are. We want to be happy, go to college, own a car, maybe raise a family. But what if that doesn't happen? I have, I
Dad, you have to teach me to suture this weekend.
Okay, I promise I will. Just come here a minute, I want to show you something.
What are you doing?
Well, since I'm not only your father, I'm also your friend; I had to get you two presents.
God, that's... this is ridiculous.
Now this is the only thing your mother ever gave me that I kept. Now it's yours. Go ahead, open it.
Now this is the only thing your mother ever gave me that I kept. Now it's yours. Go ahead, open it.
Oh god, I don't need all these presents. I don't know any kid who got a car, I mean...
They really applauded you today honey.
I was standing up there and looking at all the people, and I felt like they didn't know me. I mean, maybe I shouldn't have taken all those courses out of school, because everybody thinks I... forget it.
I was standing up there and looking at all the people, and I felt like they didn't know me. I mean, maybe I shouldn't have taken all those courses out of school, because everybody thinks I... forget it.
No, wait a minute. Everybody thinks you're what?
No, wait a minute. Everybody thinks you're what?
Everybody thinks I'm a priss.
Everybody thinks I'm a priss.
Diane, in a million years, you could never be a... priss. It's all working out for you honey, don't you see? It's all working out, just like we planned. All the years of summer school, all the vacations you gave up, it's all working out just the way we planned...
Diane, in a million years, you could never be a... priss. It's all working out for you honey, don't you see? It's all working out, just like we planned. All the years of summer school, all the vacations you gave up, it's all working out just the way we planned...
Stop it, stop it, stop it.
Stop it, stop it, stop it.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I love you dad.
I love you dad.
I love you too honey.
What?
I just had a phone call.
I just had a phone call.
Tell me, is it bad news?

No, no, just listen. You won the Wreath fellowship.
No, no, just listen. You won the Wreath fellowship.
Are you kidding? You're not kidding? You're not kidding!

I won?
I won?
You're going to take a big step, a big leap, and before you do, I just want one thing from you, miss. You stand up straight and admit you're special.
God, I'll have to go on a plane.
We'll worry about that later. Now come on, tell me that you're special.
Don't do this to me. You're too good at making me nervous.
No, listen to me. You're the best in the country, don't you understand? It's like a pyramid. It starts out with everybody, and it narrows through your life and through everything, and all the hoopla and the competition narrows it down to one brilliant person who is so special that they celebrate you on two continents. And it's you. So tell me something, where's
Morning honey.
Dad, I'm so glad I went. Goodnight.
Dad, I'm so glad I went. Goodnight.
Wait a minute. How was Lloyd?
Wait a minute. How was Lloyd?
Lloyd was such a gentleman. He was funny and nervous and strange, and I met people that I never would have met before, then I blew it. I called him basic. Can you believe I did that?
Lloyd was such a gentleman. He was funny and nervous and strange, and I met people that I never would have met before, then I blew it. I called him basic. Can you believe I did that?
Well, I don't think he's really been embarrassed by it.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
She's not the world's greatest flyer, let me tell you. When she was eight years old, she...
Dad.
Dad.
Now why can't I tell the story?
Well, let me start it. I'm flying down to Los Angeles on business, and I decide to take her on her first aeroplane.
I knew how planes flew, but I was still a little nervous.
I knew how planes flew, but I was still a little nervous.
Crash paranoia.
So anyway, they closed the doors, and she starts to scream. I've never in my life heard anyone scream quite like that.
And then you got up and you told them to turn the plane around.
And then you got up and you told them to turn the plane around.
Which they did. Let me finish.
Which they did. Let me finish.
Okay, I give up.
Okay, I give up.
So anyway, these two federal marshals meet the plane, and they take our address, and they ask us never to fly with 'Friendly Skies' again.
Oh yeah. There was, uh, somebody on the plane worked in a recording studio, and, uh, we got this telephone call, this guy is making a sound effects record, and he'd gotten our address and he wanted to know if he could come over and record her scream.
Which they did, and every once in a while on a commercial, you can hear me scream.
Morning.
Dad, I'm sorry.
Dad, I'm sorry.
You should be.
You should be.
I was irresponsible, I should have called.

You bet you should have called. You still live at home. Don't make me call the police at three-thirty in the morning, don't make me call hospitals.

Dad, I'm so sorry. I know this is a bad time.

You've always called before, always. Now I'm not asking what you did, I just want to know that you're alright.
You've always called before, always. Now I'm not asking what you did, I just want to know that you're alright.
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
Do you wanna make things easier on me? Now tell me where you were because this is, this is bullshit. You can say anything to me, I hope you still know that.
Do you wanna make things easier on me? Now tell me where you were because this is, this is bullshit. You can say anything to me, I hope you still know that.
I know that.
Lloyd?
Dad, yes. And I'm scared to death of what you must think of me right now.
Dad, yes. And I'm scared to death of what you must think of me right now.
Sit down.
Did he ever get rough with you?
Dad, no. But I didn't want any problems, so I decided not to sleep with him.
Dad, maybe I shouldn't go with all that's happening to you.
You're going.
You're going.
But listen, if I had a friend in the same position, I would tell her to delay a year.

Well listen to me. Now, I know you like him, I know he's nothing like those frat kids you can't stand, but honey, after the excitement wears off, then what, huh? What are you going to talk about?

Unbelievable. This is a nightmare.
Diane, you owe it to yourself to get on that plane with no attachments, no strings, because after you get over there, things are going to change. People change.

Dad, in a million years, I would never give him a pen. What's wrong with having some fun? I like him.
'I like him'? Diane, I'm talking about being honest with people, being decent...

How do you pay for one of those?
How do you pay for one of those?
Well, we pay for the [?]. That guy didn't want to part with it, a little matter of nine thousand dollars.
Yeah Lloyd. What are your plans for the future?
Spend as much time as possible with Diane before she leaves.
Spend as much time as possible with Diane before she leaves.
Seriously, Lloyd.
Seriously, Lloyd.
I'm totally and completely serious.
I'm totally and completely serious.
No, really.
No, really.
You mean like career? Uh, I don't know. I've, I've thought about this quite a bit sir, and I'd have to say considering what's waiting out there for me, I don't want to sell anything, buy anything or process anything as a career. I don't want to sell anything bought or processed, or buy anything sold or processed, or... process anything sold, bought or
Hi, Lloyd. This is my eighth and final call...
Go ahead, pick it up if you want.
Go ahead, pick it up if you want.
I just wanted to say that I've thought about everything, and I've decided something. I'm going to give you another chance. Maybe no one's listening, or maybe your father's listening. Mr Court, if you're listening to this, hello, how are you?
She wouldn't get out of the car. I brought her all the way here, she said she was going to come here, and she wouldn't get out of the car. But I thought that is was important, that she come to see you, because I know that if you go somewhere and you don't deal with your family stuff, then you're just gonna, she's
Are you going to England with her Lloyd?
Are you going to England with her Lloyd?
That's one of the things I wanted to talk to you about sir.
That's one of the things I wanted to talk to you about sir.
Are you?
Are you?
Am I going? Am I going to England? I've thought about this quite a bit, and I've realised what I probably should do is just carve out a goal for my future and find out what I wanna do with my life, do all the stuff that I've been avoiding in a big way. I mean, Diane and I can wait for each other,

Well Lloyd, I admire you for not hitching a ride. You know, my daughter's a lot different to you.
Well Lloyd, I admire you for not hitching a ride. You know, my daughter's a lot different to you.
I know.
I know.
She's very successful.
She's very successful.
I know
I know
Very talented.
Very talented.
I know. But then I reconsidered. 'Cause I figured out what I really wanna do with my life, what I want to do for a living is I wanna be with your daughter. I'm good at it.
I know. But then I reconsidered. 'Cause I figured out what I really wanna do with my life, what I want to do for a living is I wanna be with your daughter. I'm good at it.
You're not a permanent part of her life. You're a distraction.
You're not a permanent part of her life. You're a distraction.
I'm the distraction that's going to England with her sir. Are you alright sir? Are you okay?
I'm the distraction that's going to England with her sir. Are you alright sir? Are you okay?
I'm incarcerated, Lloyd! I don't deserve to lose my daughter over this. I don't deserve to have you as my go-between. And I can't for the life of me figure out how she could choose to champion in mediocrity the way she flirts around you.
"You can't know the horrible disappointment I feel..."
I know this part, keep reading.
I know this part, keep reading.
She can't still be angry at this, it's gotta get better.
She can't still be angry at this, it's gotta get better.
It does, it does if it's the version signed 'I still can't help loving you'. Read that.
It does, it does if it's the version signed 'I still can't help loving you'. Read that.
Just her name.
Just her name.
Just knowing a person like that exists, knowing that for a minute that she felt that and wrote 'I still can't help loving you'. That's gotta be a good thing, right? That's gotta be a good thing.
Joe. Joe. She's written sixty-five songs. They're all about you. They're all about pain.
So what's up?
So what's up?
Stop freaking with her head man. Just stop playing with her mind, you know? She's a human being. She's a person. She's very talented, you know.
Stop freaking with her head man. Just stop playing with her mind, you know? She's a human being. She's a person. She's very talented, you know.
Dude, why do you think I keep her tapes? They're going to be valuable some day.
My car.
Your car?
Diane Court.
Dude, I can't do it!
Lloyd. Lloyd Dobler, I've got you.
How ya doin' Miss Evans?
How ya doin' Miss Evans?
You missed every one of your career counselling sessions. Call me obsessive, compulsive, but let's do this right now.
You missed every one of your career counselling sessions. Call me obsessive, compulsive, but let's do this right now.
No way.
No way.
Lloyd.
Lloyd.
What?
Don't make this like a counsel, Lloyd. I got statistics I can show you, I got graphs I can show you. That's all the stuff I can show you, it all says the same thing. You have to decide on a career.
My dad's a lieutenant colonel in the army, he wants me to join, he wants to pull some strings. I mean, there's no possible way.
My dad's a lieutenant colonel in the army, he wants me to join, he wants to pull some strings. I mean, there's no possible way.
We'll just make an appointment for you at Seattle Junior College.
Lloyd, everybody in that party put something down on their record except you.
How many people really know what they want though? I mean, a lot of them think that they have to know, right? But inside, they don't really know, so, I don't know. But I know that I don't know.

Hang tough, Lloyd.
Oh boy.
Hey.
Hey.
Mike Cameron, how you doing?
Mike Cameron, how you doing?
What?
What?
Mike Cameron. This is one fresh jam, huh?
Mike Cameron. This is one fresh jam, huh?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, hey, oh god. Listen, I wanted to... I don't know you very well, you know, but I wanted to ask you, how did you get Diane Court to go out with you?
Yeah, hey, oh god. Listen, I wanted to... I don't know you very well, you know, but I wanted to ask you, how did you get Diane Court to go out with you?
I called her up.
I called her up.
Yeah, but how come it worked? I mean like, what are you?
Yeah, but how come it worked? I mean like, what are you?
I'm Lloyd Dobler.
I'm Lloyd Dobler.
This is great, this gives me hope. Thanks.
This is great, this gives me hope. Thanks.
Alright. Key?
Ooop, excuse me.
How you doin', brother?
How you doin', brother?
I don't really know where we are.
It's gotta stay purple. All night. Hey Lloyd, how ya doin'?
You know Diane Court?
You know Diane Court?
Wow, man. Well. Listen man, I need you to be the keymaster.
Oh, I was just going to...
A very responsible young man you're out with tonight.
A very responsible young man you're out with tonight.
I was gonna...
I was gonna...
Thanks a lot Lloyd.
Thanks a lot Lloyd.
I was just going to kind of move around.
You know, every year I throw this party, every year nobody helps me clear up. Why am I yelling?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know. Good on you man. Alright Lloyd.
I don't know. Good on you man. Alright Lloyd.
Maybe we'll come by tomorrow, help you clear up or something.
Maybe we'll come by tomorrow, help you clear up or something.
Diane, everybody loves that you showed up.
Certainly.
I am happy to say that this bag is officially empty.
We finally graduated, big dude guy!
Alright!
I love you man
I love you too.
Give me my firebird keys!
You must chill! You must chill! I have hidden your keys. CHILL!
You must chill! You must chill! I have hidden your keys. CHILL!
I love you man.
I love you man.
Alright, I love you too. Go to sleep.
Alright, I love you too. Go to sleep.
We're full on bonded.
We're full on bonded.
Yeah, alright.
Later for you, Luke.
I got a question. If you guys know so much about women, how come you're here at like the Gas 'n' sip on a Saturday night completely alone, drinking beers, no women anywhere?
Oskar - my friend Lena.
How do you do? What can I get you, what're you drinking?
How do you do? What can I get you, what're you drinking?
Nothing's changed. Then again, something has changed, hasn't it?
Nothing's changed. Then again, something has changed, hasn't it?
Things worked out. I made some money over there, had some laughs, you know. It was good.
Things worked out. I made some money over there, had some laughs, you know. It was good.
Now you're back.
Now you're back.
Now I'm back, and you know what I'm going to do now? I'm going to have a good time. So are you.
He's essential. Without him, everything comes to a grinding halt. If that happens -
Itzhak Stern? He's on the list.
Itzhak Stern? He's on the list.
He is.
Well, let's find him.
He's on the list. If he were an essential worker, he would not be on the list. He's on the list. You can't have him.
He's on the list. If he were an essential worker, he would not be on the list. He's on the list. You can't have him.
I'm talking to a clerk.
What's your name?
Sir, the list is correct.
Sir, the list is correct.
I didn't ask you about the list, I asked you your name.
I didn't ask you about the list, I asked you your name.
Klaus Tauber.
The gentleman thinks a mistake's been made.
My plant manager is somewhere on this train. If it leaves with him on it, it'll disrupt production and the Armaments Board will want to know why.
You know what, you'd like her.
Oskar, please -
Oskar, please -
What -
What -
I don't have to like her just because you do. It doesn't work that way.
I don't have to like her just because you do. It doesn't work that way.
You would, though. That's what I'm saying.
It's not a charade, all this?
A charade? How could it be a charade?
Luck.
War.
What?
I feel like an old-fashioned couple. It feels good.
Should I stay?
It's a beautiful city.
Should I stay?
It's up to you.
Your friend Amon Goeth has been arrested.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I'm sorry to hear that.
There are some things that are unclear. We need to talk.
There are some things that are unclear. We need to talk.
I'd love to, it'll have to wait until I get back. I have to leave.
All right, okay, let's talk.
In Breslau.
In Breslau.
Breslau? I can't go to Breslau. Not now.
We started without you.
Good.
You know, they told me you were going to be trouble - Czurda and Scherner.
You're kidding.
He looks great, though, doesn't he? I have to know - where do you get a suit like that? what is that, silk? It's great.
I'd say I'd get you one but the guy who made it, he's probably dead, I don't know.
I go to work the other day, there's nobody there. Nobody tells me about this, I have to find out, I have to go in, everybody's gone -
They're not gone, they're here.
They're not gone, they're here.
They're mine!
Every day that goes by, I'm losing money. Every worker that is shot, costs me money - I have to get somebody else, I have to train them -
We're going to be making so much money, none of this is going to matter -
We're going to be making so much money, none of this is going to matter -
It's bad business.
It's bad business.
Some of the boys went crazy, what're you going to do? You're right, it's bad business, but it's over with, it's done. Occasionally, sure, okay, you got to make an example. But that's good business.
Scherner told me something else about you.
Yeah, what's that?
Yeah, what's that?
That you know the meaning of the word gratitude. That it's not some vague thing with you like with some guys.
That you know the meaning of the word gratitude. That it's not some vague thing with you like with some guys.
True.
Do you have any idea what's involved? The paperwork alone? Forget you got to build it all, getting the fucking permits, that's enough to drive you crazy. Then the engineers show up. They stand around and they argue about drainage - I'm telling you, you'll want to shoot somebody, I've been through it, I know.
Well, you've been through it. You know. You could make things easier for me.
It's true. Never happen in Cracow, though, we all love you too much.
I pay you too much.
You held back Stern. You held back the one man most important to my business.
He's important to my business.
He's important to my business.
What do you want for him, I'll give it to you.
What do you want for him, I'll give it to you.
I want him. Come on, let's go inside, let's have a good time.
I tried to call you, I'm running a little late, this is taking longer than I thought. Have a drink.
What's going on?
What's going on?
I got a shipment of Hungarians coming in, I got to make room for them. It's always something.
You took my workers.
They're taking mine. When I said they didn't have a future I didn't mean tomorrow. Auschwitz.
They're taking mine. When I said they didn't have a future I didn't mean tomorrow. Auschwitz.
When?
When?
I don't know. Soon.
You want these people.
These people, my people, I want my people.
What are you, Moses? What is this? Where's the money in this? What's the scam?
It's good business.
It's good business.
Oh, this is "good business" in your opinion. You've got to move them, the equipment, everything to Czechoslovakia - it doesn't make any sense.
Oh, this is "good business" in your opinion. You've got to move them, the equipment, everything to Czechoslovakia - it doesn't make any sense.
Look -
Look -
You're not telling me something.
You're not telling me something.
It's good for me - I know them, I'm familiar with them. It's good for you - you'll be compensated. It's good for the Army. You know what I'm going to make? Artillery shells. Tank shells. They need that. Everybody's happy.
It's good for me - I know them, I'm familiar with them. It's good for you - you'll be compensated. It's good for the Army. You know what I'm going to make? Artillery shells. Tank shells. They need that. Everybody's happy.
Yeah, sure.
If you admit to making three, then it's four, actually. But how?
I just told you.
I just told you.
You did, but you didn't.
Yeah, all right, don't tell me, I'll go along with it, it's just irritating to me I can't figure it out.
All you have to do is tell me what it's worth to you. What's a person worth to you.
Where are the guards?
The guards aren't allowed on the factory floor. They make my workers nervous.
What's that?
You don't recognize it? Maybe that's because it's not what I asked for.
You don't recognize it? Maybe that's because it's not what I asked for.
You asked for shoe polish.
You asked for shoe polish.
My buyers sold it to a guy who sold it to the Army. But by the time it got there - because of the cold - it broke, the whole truckload.

So I'm responsible for the weather?
So I'm responsible for the weather?
I asked for metal, you gave me glass.
I asked for metal, you gave me glass.
This is not my problem.
This is not my problem.
Look it up.
Ghetto Police. I'm a policeman now, can you believe it?
Yeah, I can.
Hey, Poldek, how's it going? You know about the list? You're on it.
Of course I'm on it.
Of course I'm on it.
You want to stay on it? What do you got for me?
What do I got for you?
Takes diamonds to stay on this list.
I want to thank you, sir, for giving me the opportunity to work.
You're welcome, I'm sure you're doing a great job.
The SS beat me up. They would have killed me, but I'm essential to the war effort, thanks to you.
That's great.
That's great.
I work hard for you. I'll continue to work hard for you.
I work hard for you. I'll continue to work hard for you.
That's great, thanks.
That's great, thanks.
God bless you, sir.
God bless you, sir.
Yeah, okay.
Yeah, okay.
You're a good man.
Like this?
There's nothing in the stores.
You have any idea what a shirt like this costs?
Nice things cost money.
How many?
I don't know, ten or twelve. That's a good color. Dark blues, grays.
How you feeling, all right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
What's the matter, everything all right at home? Mila's okay?
What's the matter, everything all right at home? Mila's okay?
She's good.
What's wrong with it?
How should I know? It's broken. See what you can do.
Good. How's it going?
Things are great, things are great.
What are you doing?
I'm having a drink, come on in, we'll have a drink.
I'm having a drink, come on in, we'll have a drink.
I mean where have you been? Nobody's seen you around for a while.
I mean where have you been? Nobody's seen you around for a while.
I've been here. I guess I haven't been out.
I've been here. I guess I haven't been out.
I thought maybe you'd like to come over, have some dinner, some of the people are coming over.
I thought maybe you'd like to come over, have some dinner, some of the people are coming over.
Yeah? Yeah, that'd be nice, let me get my coat.
Oskar, good of you to come.
Are you kidding, I never miss a party. Police Chief Rasch, my wife Emilie.
Are you kidding, I never miss a party. Police Chief Rasch, my wife Emilie.
How do you do?
Thank you.
I need a drink.
I need a drink.
Oh, God, you don't have a drink?
Oh, God, you don't have a drink?
Wine?
One of these days the Russians are going to show up unannounced at my gate. I'd like the chance to defend myself. I'd like my wife to have that chance. My civilian engineers. My secretary.
We're losing the war, aren't we.
We're losing the war, aren't we.
It kind of looks that way.
It kind of looks that way.
Pistols?
Pistols?
Pistols, rifles, carbines ... I'd be grateful.
I'd never ask you for money, you know that. I don't even like talking about it - money, favors - I find it very awkward, it makes me very uncomfortable -
No, look. It's the others. They're the ones causing these delays.
No, look. It's the others. They're the ones causing these delays.
What others?
What others?
Whoever. They're the ones. They'd appreciate some kind of gesture from me.
That'd be fine.
Done. Lets not talk about it anymore, let's have a good time.
The place produces nothing. I shouldn't say that - nothing it produces reaches the Army. That's not all right.
So I'll talk to him about it.
So I'll talk to him about it.
He's a friend of yours, you want to help him out. Tell me this, though - has he ever once shown you his appreciation? I've yet to see it. Never a courtesy. Never a thank you note. He forgets my wife at Christmas time -
He's a friend of yours, you want to help him out. Tell me this, though - has he ever once shown you his appreciation? I've yet to see it. Never a courtesy. Never a thank you note. He forgets my wife at Christmas time -
He's got no style, we all know that. So, we should hang him for it?
He doesn't deserve your loyalty. More important, he's not worth you making threats against us.
Did I threaten anybody here? I stated a simple fact.
I was just the accountant.
Simple engineering, though, wouldn't you think? Change the machines around, whatever you do, you could make other things, couldn't you?
Once the war ends, forget it, but for now it's great, you could make a fortune. Don't you think?
I think most people right now have other priorities.
Get the contracts and I'm sure you'll do very well. In fact the worse things get the better you'll do. It was a "pleasure."
The contracts? That's the easy part. Finding the money to buy the company, that's hard.
Jews, yeah. Investors.
Jews can no longer own businesses, sir, that's why this one's for sale.
Jews can no longer own businesses, sir, that's why this one's for sale.
Well, they wouldn't own it, I'd own it. I'd pay them back in product. They can trade it on the black market, do whatever they want, everybody's happy.
Pots and pans.
Something they can hold in their hands.
I don't know anybody who'd be interested in that.
They should be.
What was that about the SS, the rate, the ... ?
The Jewish worker's salary, you pay it directly to the SS, not to the worker. He gets nothing.
The Jewish worker's salary, you pay it directly to the SS, not to the worker. He gets nothing.
But it's less. It's less than what I would pay a Pole. That's the point I'm trying to make. Poles cost more.
I could try to read this or I could eat my lunch while it's till hot. We're doing well?
Yes.
Yes.
Better this month than last?
Better this month than last?
Yes.
Yes.
Any reason to think next month will be worse?
Any reason to think next month will be worse?
The war could end.
What?
There's a machinist outside who'd like to thank you personally for giving him a job.
Don't ever do that to me again.
Do what?
You try to be fair to people, they walk out the door; I've never understood that. What's next?
Christmas presents.
Christmas presents.
Ah, yes.
This, I don't know, maybe you can trade it for something.
Thank you.
I got to go, I'll see you.
Oskar -
You think I don't know what you're doing? You're so quiet all the time? I know.
Are you losing money?
Are you losing money?
No, I'm not losing money, that's not the point.
No, I'm not losing money, that's not the point.
What other point is -
What other point is -
It's dangerous. It's dangerous, to me, personally.
You have to understand, Goeth's under enormous pressure. You have to think of it in his situation. He's got this whole place to run, he's responsible for everything that goes on here, all these people - he's got a lot of things to worry about. And he's got the war. Which brings out the worst in people. Never the good, always the bad. Always
And killing.
And killing.
I'll admit it's a weakness. I don't think he enjoys it. All right, he does enjoy it, so what? What do you expect me to do about it?
I'll admit it's a weakness. I don't think he enjoys it. All right, he does enjoy it, so what? What do you expect me to do about it?
There's nothing you can do. I'm not asking you to do anything. You came into my office.
I'll talk to him.
I think it's too late.
I think it's too late.
Well, I'll talk to somebody. I'll take care of it.
Four hundred, four fifty -
More.
Eight hundred, give or take.
Give or take what, Stern - how many - count them.
That's very generous of you.
Yes.
We need to talk.
Stern.
They arrived.
They arrived, can you believe it?
Well, that's to be expected. They have to understand. These are start-up problems. This isn't pots and pans, this is a precise business. I'll write them a letter.
They're withholding payment.
They're withholding payment.
Well, sure. So would I. So would you. I wouldn't worry about it. We'll get it right one of these days.
There's a rumor you've been going around miscalibrating the machines. I don't think that's a good idea.
No?
I know what you're saying, but I don't see the difference.
You don't? I do. I see a difference.
You don't? I do. I see a difference.
You'll lose money.
I'll talk to you later.
No, no, what, what is it?
I could've got more ... if I'd just ... I don't know, if I'd just ... I could've got more...
Oskar, there are twelve hundred people who are alive because of you. Look at them.
If I'd made more money ...I threw away so much money, you have no idea. If I'd just ...
There will be generations because of what you did.
There will be generations because of what you did.
I didn't do enough.
I didn't do enough.
You did so much.
It's got nothing to do with reality, Oskar, I know it and you know it, it's a matter of national priority to these guys. It's got a ritual significance to them, Jews shoveling snow.
I lost a day of production. I lost a worker. I expect to be compensated.
I lost a day of production. I lost a worker. I expect to be compensated.
File a grievance with the Economic Office, it's your right.
File a grievance with the Economic Office, it's your right.
Would it do any good?
Would it do any good?
No.
A one-armed machinist, Oskar?
He was a metal press operator, quite skilled.
What's he done that's so bad - take money? That's a crime? Come on, what are we here for, to fight a war? We're here to make money, all of us.
There's taking money and there's taking money, you know that. He's taking money.
He's stealing from you, Oskar.
Of course he's stealing from me, we're in business together. What is this? I'm sitting here, suddenly everybody's talking like this is something bad. We take from each other, we take from the Army, everybody uses everybody, it works out, everybody's happy.
We know that, son.
The killer was trying to get to her. That sorority girl was a distraction.
The killer was trying to get to her. That sorority girl was a distraction.
We're aware of that.
I can do it, Captain.
Thanks, Dewey, but I was thinking I'd pull Jesse off...
How's the name search going?
37 usages of Himbry located in the registar's office. 9 Tatum's, 47 Riley's. And that's just on campus. It's hopeless.
Can't we hold him?
No, we got pressure from California State. The man practically has clemency. We can't run the risk of falsely accusing him. He has to be standing over the victim with knife in hand before we make a move.
No, we got pressure from California State. The man practically has clemency. We can't run the risk of falsely accusing him. He has to be standing over the victim with knife in hand before we make a move.
What now?
We're going to bring her in. Hide her out for a coupla days. And we're issuing a campus lock-in this evening. No one is allowed out after dark.
That doesn't work, sir.
Have you checked the...
Attic, garage, basement, nothing.
Attic, garage, basement, nothing.
Take the neighborhood.
We don't know if it's random. We haven't been able to connect the victims.
The first two were stabbed without thought. The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.
Jesus Christ. Captain Tyler flies out of his seat and into action.
Find me every variation of Himbry and what was the other name...
He's broken his pattern.
They've broken their pattern.
They've broken their pattern.
You're sure about this two person thing?
You're sure about this two person thing?
Broad daylight, a crowded movie theatre. This is too much fun for one person.
I would say we are now officially baffled.
On national television.
No, they broke up again. Bailey won't stop drinking and Sarah can't take it anymore.
thought he was doing AA.

No, he quit - the whole God thing--he has issues. The previews for next week...

I won't.

Don't. Think Bailey.
Don't. Think Bailey.
Alright, alright...I'll call you back.
No, some creep asshole trying to scare me.
It's hell week. Chill. The movie murders have brought out the crazies. It's nothing.
Shit.

Hello? Ted?

Cotton.
Can we talk?

I don't think that's a good idea.

What do you want from me, Cotton?

You could start with an apology.

I did that.

You wrote me a letter. Very cordial. Very appropriate.

I wish it was just a year. I lost everything because of you. I have nothing now. Look at me, this is what I've become. A long silence. Sidney is hanging on by threads.
I wish it was just a year. I lost everything because of you. I have nothing now. Look at me, this is what I've become. A long silence. Sidney is hanging on by threads.
Cotton, there isn't one day, one hour, one minute when I'm not reminded of what I've done. I have not had one second of reprieve and no therapy or religion or spiritual plane can ever erase what I feel in every vein of my being. And I wish I had in me what you need to hear but I don't think the words exist.
I just thought if I saw you face to face, maybe it would help.
Did it?
Did it?
It helped me realize one thing.
It helped me realize one thing.
What?
What?
You're a self-obsessed little cunt like your mother.
Its perfect, Sidney. No one will ever suspect me. I have proof. Im the victim.
Please, Cotton, dont do this.
I get my revenge and make some fast cash.
Its over, Cotton.
Its over, Cotton.
Not until youre dead.
You know the story, Gale. Man falsely accused, sent to prison, proved innocent, released back into the real world and never trusted again. Want the exclusive?
Did you do it?
Now, Gale, you were so instrumental in my freedom. You're not having character doubts now, are you?
You have a right to be angry.
You have a right to be angry.
No, Gale, I don't have any rights. You made sure of that.
No, Gale, I don't have any rights. You made sure of that.
Cotton, I've done nothing but help you.
Cotton, I've done nothing but help you.
You've done nothing but get rich off of me. How many books have you sold, Gale? You think I don't understand points and royalties and ancilliary rights?
Don't do anything stupid, Cotton. You've come to far.
Gale, I don't know what I'm doing from one moment to the next. I'm just taking it as it comes.
Look, I'm sorry about the face.

Look, I know you kinda hold me up as your career template and it gives you some anal charge to challenge me but you win. Okay? I'm not interested in the scoop anymore. Excuse me.
I couldnt believe you didnt recognize me. You even interviewed me for your book.
Youre all in this together?
Jesus, youre just as whacked as your son.
Where do you think he got it? Mental illness is heriditary. Who do you think incouraged him to kill your mother? He was a smart kid but children need parental guidance.
What are you going to do?
Finish what my son started.
Finish what my son started.
But youll never get away with it.

Enter Cotton Weary.
How do you put up with this Greek shit?
Hey, it's cool. Hallie's into it, I'm into Hallie...
My documentary is due on Tuesday.
What's your subject?
What's your subject?
I WAS A SORORITY SLUT.
I could use some therapy.
Should we be worried about this guy? Isn't it kinda weird he just showed up and now people are dying?
I think he's doing Dolly.
"And I hope life treats you kind and I hope you have all you dreamed of offffff. I wish you JOYYY."
"And I hope life treats you kind and I hope you have all you dreamed of offffff. I wish you JOYYY."
Definitely Whitney.
Are they aware of your not so positive portrayal of Greek life?
Not one bit.
Not one bit.
Where's Sid?
Where's Sid?
She dumped me.
She dumped me.
No way.
No way.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You freakin?
How are you? You weren't in class. I called as soon as I heard...
I skipped. Too many "That's her" looks.
I skipped. Too many "That's her" looks.
I'm sorry, baby. What can I do'?
I'm sorry, baby. What can I do'?
Don't ask what you can do. No coddling. Life rolls on status quo.
It's okay. I can peddle toilet paper.
Sid, you don't have to.
Where have you been'? You missed my shining moment. I won the macaroni sundae binge.
I'm sorry honey. I got behind.
About what?
The forbidden subject.
Lemme take you home.
I'll get my jacket.
This is exactly what I don't want.
I think it's out of your control.
My screwed up life shouldn't have to bleed onto my friends.
Let us decide that.
Let us decide that.
What about your film? Isn't it due next week? Have you even started it?
What about your film? Isn't it due next week? Have you even started it?
It's under control.
I had the four o'clock shift. You weren't there. You had us worried. Is everything okay?
No, it's not.
No, it's not.
I don't really know what happened in Woodsboro, Sid. But I know you don't trust me.
I don't really know what happened in Woodsboro, Sid. But I know you don't trust me.
It's not you, Derek. I don't trust myself. I tend to make big selection errors when it comes to men.
It's not you, Derek. I don't trust myself. I tend to make big selection errors when it comes to men.
Then I'll make this easy for you. I like you. I'm crazy about you, Sid. But I'm gonna stay away. Until you say otherwise.
Go on, untie him.
No. This is a set up.
No. This is a set up.
Thats quick.
Why?
Good question. You took the bait.
Poor Cotton, could life be a little more cruel?
Youre not going to get away with this.
Yeah, were trying to send a message to Hollywood. Im really getting tired of all the happy endings. Its just not reality. In the real world the good guys die, the innocent are punished, and the murderers inherit the earth.
But nobody wants to see that. Itll never go. Theyll rewrite you. You dont want that.
Two.
So you'll relieve me at 2:30...
So you'll relieve me at 2:30...
And watch her til 8:00--I've got to edit.
Where's Sid?
Damned if I know. She ditched me.
Damned if I know. She ditched me.
You weren't supposed to leave her alone.
You weren't supposed to leave her alone.
I didn't say she was alone. That guy-- from her home town showed up. They went off together.
She's got guards with her.
What guy?
What guy?
Randy somebody.
He seemed harmless.
Aren't most serial killers seemingly harmless?
Need some help, honey.
I got it..
Yeah, you look quizzical yet pensive.
Yeah, how can we help? Do you have any questions regarding the sequel of your life?
Ever see NATURAL BORN KILLERS? Well, Derek and I have this whole Mickey/Mallory-Woody Harrelson/Juliette Lewis thing going on.
I really dont like that comparison, honey.
I really dont like that comparison, honey.

Youre the one who got away.
Youre the one who got away.
Until now.
Of course not. Who wants to? Whats the point if we dont get caught? Wheres the glamour in that?
The way I see it. Well be arrested. Go to prison. Cash in on the home footage. Secure a book deal. If all goes as planned, our trial should coincide with the release of STAB II.

Hope youre ready, Sid. We got one last surprise for you.
A twist ending if you will.
Yeah, we really had our work cut out for us. It really is the curse of the sequel. The Billy/Stu things been done.

Just for you, Sid.

Wait a sec, Derek. We forgot to flip.
Oh yeah. We figure the one of us that actually kills you will get a little more press. Its been an ongoing discussion. Heads or tails?
Tails.
We had to have financing.
Tuitions expensive.

No, what you are is a money hungry, fame- seeking liar and--forgive me for saying-- mediocre writer who has a cold storage shed where her heart should be.
You have every right to be upset.

How do you know my dim-witted inexperience isn't merely a subtle form of manipulation used to lower people's expectations thereby enhancing my ability to effectively maneuver within any given situation?
I'm sorry. I don't know what else to say except I'm sorry.
No, I'm the one who's sorry. I misjudged you. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some oozing to do.
So what made you change your mind about Sidney?
Mood swing. I'm manic depressive.

You're a hard one to figure out. GALE It's that complex yet shallow quality. It's deliberate.

I know that.
I know that.
Yeah?
Yeah?
I also know that you're an aging TV reporter slash writer who, despite huge tabloid success, has some self worth issues regarding your personal life which directly effects your professional life in a non-positive manner. A coupla failed relationships with--I'm guessing balding, older men--have turned you into this bitch with a cell phone. But I bet sometimes, late at night, when you're all alone
Not good. How you doin?
Not good.
If you were truly a copycat, wouldn't you want to emulate everything about the killer that you could?
Meaning?
Meaning?
He's already gotta be a part of Sid's life. What do you know about this Derek?

Shit! It's both of them. The first murders were to throw us - using the same names as Woodsboro. But they've moved on- -they're getting closer to Sidney. They're not looking for a Himbry or a Tatum to kill. They're looking for the new Tatum.

Ssshh! What was that?
Let's find out.
This is all too familiar.

C'mon. Let's go.
Jesus Christ!
He filmed his victims.
Let's go.
No, wait here.
Dewey?
There's nothing. I'm coming down.
Three hundred people watched? Nobody did anything?
They thought it was a publicity stunt.

Oh my God. How could it happen?

It's a copycat killer I knew this would happen. That fucking movie.
As of now, they don't see any relation. But they're checking it out. The state, Special Task Force, FBI--they're all here. They'll find the guy.
Yeah, right.
Yeah, right.
Look, Sid, why don't you take off? Disappear for a few days. I'll come with you.
Look, Sid, why don't you take off? Disappear for a few days. I'll come with you.
No. I will not crawl under a rock. This is a fucked-up world and people kill people all the time. I'll just get used to it.
You go, it's all stairs, I can take it from here.

No. This is nothing, Dewey. I'll be okay. Go back to work and let me get back to my quasi pseudo-happy existence.
The police are waiting outside. They're going to take you somewhere safe.
Dewey, there's no such place.
Dewey, there's no such place.
Humor me, Sid.
Hey, I got stuff to do. But I'll find you later, okay.
Whatever.

I'll give you one guess.

No, Hallie, not tonight. Parties and mass murderers don't go together. Trust me.
No, no, I hadn't planned on going, it's just Mickey will be pissed.
It's okay to break, girl. You shatter if you have to.
I'd really just like to be alone.
Can I come with her?
No, Hallie, I'm not gonna take you down too. I'll be alright.
I'm the only one who can cut him down.
It's not a good idea, Hallie.
Oh, Sid, youre sounding desparate. I guess fearing death makes one anxious.
You fucking freaked out movie nut psychos..
A patio chair comes flying through a glass door. The young girl in the movie tears off running, SCREAMING, flying through the room.
The crowd is really with the movie. Some even talk to the screen. "You dumb bitch. Get out of the house." etc.
The young girl runs by a window. She looks in. A GHOST MASKED KILLER stares back. The Figure CRASHES through the window attacking her. She fights him off, getting away, running...
Everyone in the theater is SCREAMING. Maureen tries her best to detach herself from the movie. She eats her popcorn.
The Ghost advances on the young girl, grabbing her, pulling her to him, raising high a long, hunting knife. The young girl is helpless...
Maureen looks at Phil, confused...as if seeing for the first time...IT'S NOT PHIL. She pulls away when, the Ghost-masked Figure grabs her with one hand, the other one clutching the hunting knife. Maureen sees it, her mouth billowing forth a LOUD SCREAM That is matched by the entire audience as they SCREAM at the screen.
The young girl, clutching her bloody chest...drags herself, crawling across wet grass...the killer behind her...raising his knife again.
Popcorn flies as Maureen falls forward, into the aisle, clutching her bloody stomach. She's speechless, unable to SCREAM. She holds her bloody hand out for all to see, begging for help. She stumbles down the aisle. Someone YELLS "Sit down." Maureen turns to several PEOPLE who begin to react. She turns behind her to see the Ghost Face coming at her again...knife raised.

The young girl is slashed again.
The knife slices into Maureen again...then again. The theatre audience is starting to take note as the Ghost keeps slashing at her repeatedly with the knife. A horrifying, sickening sight.
How many guys they have on you?
I counted four.
I've been waiting for you, baby.
Is that cool? Just to leave her like that?
Randy Meeks. He was with Sid that night in Woodsboro.
Her old boyfriend?
Her old boyfriend?
No, she killed her boyfriend. Randy was a friend. MICKEY Watch out, Derek.
And white.
Easy black boy.
Easy black boy.
It's documented. Most serial killers are attractive--slightly off white males in their twenties.
Have they questioned you yet, Sid?
This has nothing to do with me, Joel. There's an estimated 270 serial killers currently active in the US at any given time. I can't control that. Who's hungry?
I gotta hit the library. Anatomy. Some of us have real majors. You gonna be okay, Sid?
You're not allowed to ask that.
You're not allowed to ask that.
I'll stop by the Deltas tonight.
I'll stop by the Deltas tonight.
Thanks, Joel.
Perfect. I'll be outta Micro-bio and we can grab a bite.

Closer than you think.
Do you want to die?
Gee, let me think. "Do you want to..." Is that the best you can do? Some tired hand me down rehash? Hey, pal, no one's gonna write a book about you. No movie rights. Nothing. I've been through this before and much better I might add.
I hate scary movies.
It'll be okay, baby, I'll hold your hand.

Now.
Now why does she have to be naked? How does that serve the plot?
Sssshhh. ON SCREEN The phone RINGS. The young girl pulls the shower curtain aside to reveal a robe hung on a hook. She grabs it, running from the bathroom, into the living room, grabbing the phone.
Why doesn't she just hang up and call the police? Stupid..
Shush.
Shush.
I'm gonna pee. You want anything?
You ass.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry but I had to. It was too easy.

Well, yeah...she gave me a job. Freelance. It got me outta Woodsboro. I'm sorry about Cotton and yesterday. It was a bad idea. I knew it was a bad idea but it seemed like a quasi harmless bad idea. Ah, shit, Sid, I'm fucked up. Sidney looks at him Long and hard, a smile slowly appearing.

There's always someone out there stalking actors. Look at that woman from the Commish.
Melinda McGraw?
Melinda McGraw?
No, the other one. The one who played his wife.
No, Jennifer Love Hewitt. Of course it's me, silly. And I feel like an ass standing in this theater lobby all by myself. Where are you babe, the movie starts in twenty minutes.
Look, I'm stuck on the freeway. I think there was some big accident. It could be a little while so I don't want you to start freaking if I don't get there at exactly, Eight thirty.

Now let's see you act your way out of this one.
What do you mean?
I mean, I'm standing right outside the LADIES ROOM door at the PLAZA THEATER. Your girlfriend Christine is in there. She's all alone. Everyone's in the auditorium waiting for the film to start. I've got my knife.
Listen you sick fuck, is this your idea of a joke?
More of a game really.

You seem to be familiar with the STAB movies. Here's how we play. I ask you a question. You get it right, your girlfriend lives. You answer wrong, she dies.

No! You listen to me, if you're not where I want you in fifteen minutes I'll hollow her out. Do you understand?
Yeah.

Where are you?
Closer than you think.

Alright I'm here. What the fuck do you want from me?
Alright I'm here. What the fuck do you want from me?
To see your reaction.
To see your reaction.
Reaction to what?
Can I help you?
I'm Gale Weathers, author of the Woodsboro and Windsor College murders, and anchorwoman for TOTAL ENTERTAINMENT. Maybe you've heard of me?
I don't watch TV and I hate books. Whatta you need?
Does the name Maureen Prescott sound familiar to you?
Does the name Maureen Prescott sound familiar to you?
Nope.
Nope.
Well can you tell me if the woman in this picture looks familiar to you.
Listen, I'm busy. Nobody has access to those files except studio execs. Can you please go away now?
Well if you won't work for me, will you work for the president?
I know every face in here, respect for the unknown actor I suppose, myself included. If you're looking for Maureen Prescott --
It may be Maureen Reynolds --
It may be Maureen Reynolds --
Well you'll find neither. Rina Reynolds, however, You will.
What are these movies? 'Amazombies', 'Space Psychos' 'Creatures from theSan Andreas Fault'?
Horror flicks. B-Movies from Milton's heyday.
Jesus Christ you scared the shit out of me.
I'm sorry Miss Weathers. Allow me to introduce myself, MARK KINCAID, L.A.P.D. Are you familiar with the actor Ben Damon, or the actress CHRISTINE PERKINS?
I'm sorry Miss Weathers. Allow me to introduce myself, MARK KINCAID, L.A.P.D. Are you familiar with the actor Ben Damon, or the actress CHRISTINE PERKINS?
Well I interviewed Damon once for the show. He was a real obnoxious fuck. Any way, the second one, Christine Perkins, she had a part in Stab 2, didn't she? She was playing CICI.

Both of them were found brutally murdered this morning under the Hollywood sign. Autopsy reports having come back to me yet but the bodies looked like something out one of the Stab films.

So is that why you're here? Is that why you're holding me from my show, to tell me about some brutal homicide I'm not even involved in?

I wish that was all Miss Weathers, but there's more. The killer left a note.

A note?
That's Sidney Prescott's mother.
There's more.
I've tried to get in touch with Sidney Prescott, but she's keeping herself very well hidden. You're my one and only hope in finding her. Her life may be in grave danger.
I'd love to help, really I wouldn't mind being sliced at again by a maniacal psychopath, but I honestly don't know where Sidney is. After Windsor she dropped off the face of the Earth. The only other person that might know is, , not going to talk.

Alright Kincaid, no where to?
I go to the police station and do my job, and you go back to being Gale Weathers.

Oh. I thought you wanted me to stick around.
Oh. I thought you wanted me to stick around.
Look, Miss Weathers, if there's a problem, give me a call. Here's my card. I'm always there.
That's STAB 3, Miss Weathers. It looks like we're going to be getting a warrant to speak with Miss Prescott anyway.
Shit. Sarah Darling. I interviewed her too. God, it's happening again isn't it Detective?
Shit. Sarah Darling. I interviewed her too. God, it's happening again isn't it Detective?
Yes well we have a suspect, so don't get that worried.
Who?
I'm not at liberty to tell you that Miss Weathers. You're no longer working with the L.A.P.D. I don't even know why you're standing in here right now. By all means I should have you thrown out.

Please, call me Gale.
Please, call me Gale.
Deal, but I'm still Detective Kincaid,ok?
Whoever it is, now is taking credit for Maureen Prescott's murder.
But we know who killed Maureen Prescott, Billy Loomis and Stu Macher. I mean, they even told Sidney how they did it!
But we know who killed Maureen Prescott, Billy Loomis and Stu Macher. I mean, they even told Sidney how they did it!
Yeah, but, if I'm not mistaken, you said in your book that Sidney got it wrong before. She accused Cotton Weary of murdering her mother, and he was sent away for it! Maybe there is a third killer. Sidney Might know something
Four? There are five.
Ben Damon. Christine Perkins. Sarah Darling. Tom Prinze. That's four, last time I learned how to count.
OK, look. We all know that this has something to do with 'Stab 3'. What we do not know is why the killer keeps leaving articles about Maureen Prescott.
Actually, there was more this time. This time, we found a picture too.
Boys, boys, why don't we compare our gun calibers later? The issue is Maureen Prescott!
Wrong, this issue is Sidney Prescott! And either Mr. Riley is going to obstruct justice or is going to put me in touch with her. So, where is she?
Jesus Gale what happened?
He killed Milton! The killer's inside there! Oh God! DEWEY! Dewey's in there too! He needs medical help! He's hurt!
He killed Milton! The killer's inside there! Oh God! DEWEY! Dewey's in there too! He needs medical help! He's hurt!
Alright, calm down. I'm going to radio in for backup right now.
The killer leaves a newspaper clipping at each murder, Sidney. Recently he's also left a photo of your mother.
Why didn't you tell me? This is my mother, Dewey. Why didn't you say something?
Are you sure?
Absolutely.
What do you know about trilogies?
You mean like, movie trilogies?

I'll call you Mark when you catch the killer, Detective.

Can't arrest ghosts. But the best way to stop being haunted is to be with people. You're here, you're not hiding, you've done the right thing, Miss Prescott.

Hmm.

What did you know about your mother?
What did you know about your mother?
I used to think I had the perfect mom, perfect family. Till I found out I was wrong. She had a secret life, and I tried to understand that, and soon as I thought I had, more secrets. I don't' know who my mom was. Sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about my mother for the first time. You know, with TV and

Oh yeah, how?
Oh yeah, how?
Catch him, or kill him.
Mr. Rielly? My name is Mark Kincaid. I'm with the L.A.P.D. Are you aware of last night's Events?
Yeah. A real tragedy.
That's fine Mr. Rielly, but if anyone else should die, I'm going to have to get a warrant.
Understood. If you'll excuse me Detective. Gale.
I told you, I don't know where Sidney is. And even if there was a third killer, Sidney doesn't know about it.
That is for me to decide. I need to talk to her Mr. Riley, she is a key element in this case. I have a press conference in an hour, and I need to explain why there are four dead celebrities.
What about Angelina Tyler? She was there too.
Police are still searching through the debris. Could be days before we find her . . . that is, if she's even there.
Before you jump to conclusions, the man in the picture, COTTON WEARY, is out of the country on business. His alibi checks out. Seems he's got a TV show in Australia, 100% COTTON. It's supposedly the biggest thing down under since Yahoo Serious, but that's besides the point.
What does this have to do with Sid?
What does this have to do with Sid?
Who knows more about Maureen Prescott than her own daughter?

Well Sid's dad couldn't help you and he was married to Maureen.
Is that a threat, Detective?
When it's a threat, you'll know it.

There's someone here who wants to help.
Nice to finally meet you, Sidney.
The killer called her.
The killer called her.
What? When?
Sidney, do you have any idea how he could've gotten your number?
He could've monitored the calls on a scanner. Did you call her from the set?
He could've monitored the calls on a scanner. Did you call her from the set?
No.
Jesus Christ Sidney, what happened? I got a call on my cell from home. They told me that someone was attacked.
And what made you think it was Sidney?
And what made you think it was Sidney?
Sid, get in my car. You're coming back to the station with me where it's safe.
What are you doing here? I told you to stay hidden! It's not safe for you up here.
Well it's not safe for me up there either. The killer found me Dewey. He called me last night.
Well it's not safe for me up there either. The killer found me Dewey. He called me last night.
What?
What?
I figured I'd be safe If I was at least up here with the people I care about. Now where's this Kincaid guy the news is talking about? I found this place from a FOX 5 TV NEWS REPORT. Heh.

Follow me.
I was afraid they were bait, something to, ya know, trick you out of hiding.
Listen, Detective, I wanna see this studio where all this shit's going down.
Alright Sid, over there is the STAB 3 Production offices. That's where Sarah Darling was murdered last night.
Mm, what a waste of Silicone. What does my mother have to do with this all Dewey? We're a long way from Woodsboro.
Karen Colcheck. From Woodsboro.
She was Randy's only girlfriend . . . ever.
I can see nothing's changed.
No.
Listen Dewey I have to go to the bathroom.
Do you want me to come with you Sid? I mean, remember what Randy said?
Do you want me to come with you Sid? I mean, remember what Randy said?
No I'll be ok. I've got my mace. My knife. These two lethal weapons.
Don't worry, I've got a permit for it.
Jesus Christ Dewey help me! They tried to kill me in the bathroom! The killers!
Yeah?

Dewey my God I thought you were dead.
Don't worry Sid I'd never leave you like that.
Don't worry Sid I'd never leave you like that.
DEWEY! IT'S GALE!
Watch out Sid. Randy said the killer's always superhuman.
He wasn't superhuman Dewey. He wasn't superhuman at all.
Dewey, personal lives and pasts aside, this is about Sidney. We need to know where she is.
What so you can just exploit her again with another book? Sid doesn't need you Gale.
What so you can just exploit her again with another book? Sid doesn't need you Gale.

Stop following me.
I happen to work for the police god dammit!

Fuck!
Don't worry. I'm prepared for anything.
Amen boy scout, now answer the fucking door!
OH. OH GOD. GALE --
What?
What?
GALE BEHIND YOU!
Thank you.
Sid, this is detective Kincaid.
Do you have her number stored in your memory? Phone memory!
Oh. Yeah, I guess I do.
Oh. Yeah, I guess I do.
Has anyone else every used your phone?
Has anyone else every used your phone?
Just Jennifer. And you.
I've got an idea, I'll hook up with you guys later.
Do you want us to come with you?
Do you want us to come with you?
I work better alone. Why don't you do some snooping around the set?
Sidney, what happened?
Nevermind, what'd you two find?
Paternity test results. Christ Dewey, you're never going to believe who Milton's kid is.
Who is it?
Gale, I know this is a bad time and all but what if we try it out again. The whole relationship thing.
Sure, why not. You did Save my life,Mr. Rielly.
So you knew Sidney Prescott's mother.
Just what the hell do you people think you're doing, barging in here like this? I've got important calls to make. I run this studio.
What's your point?
No point, I'm just gonna give Detective Kincaid a call.
No point, I'm just gonna give Detective Kincaid a call.
I remember her! She was a bit player in a couple of my movies. A nobody! So what does it matter?
What the hell are you guys getting at? I make horror films, that's what I do. The Studio came to me with 'Stab'. They came to me, check it out.
But you know who she was.
But you know who she was.
When we did the first 'Stab" I realized I'd known Maureen Prescott before, I mean as Rina. I couldn't tell anyone. Can you imagine the press?
Good morning Gale. Pleasure to be here.
It's a pleasure to finally meet you, Roman.
It's a pleasure to finally meet you, Roman.
Well it's a honor to be here amongst so many fans of the genre. And I must say that any of you worried that Jerry Rapp, or Tori or David not returning to complete the STAB trilogy, have no fear, Roman is here. Aided with my excellent cast of newcomers I believe we're going to pull off one of the best Stabs yet.

Roman, from your enthusiasm it certainly seems that way. Honestly though, tell us, what's your favorite scary movie?
Roman, from your enthusiasm it certainly seems that way. Honestly though, tell us, what's your favorite scary movie?
Honestly, my life.
Your life?
Well if you were in my shoes, dealing with those big Time Sunrise Studio producers like I do on a daily basis, you'd watch how quick your life goes from a Walt Disney picture to a Tobe Hooper flick.
Would you excuse me for a moment?
Sure.
You! How can I ever get any fame playing you!
Dewey, what the hell is she rambling about now? What's wrong Jen, see yourself on one of those USA NETWORK winners you did and realize how badly you suck at acting?

God damn you Gale Weathers! Don't you see? The killer is choosing his victims as they die in the script! Ben Damon's character was the first one to get offed. So was his girlfriend - but she wasn't cast yet so his real girlfriend was killed - then Sarah Darling's Candy, and now me!

Wait a second, whoa! Calm down! Number one there were five different versions of the script given out. Ben Damon was given a fake script because he was only being offered the role. It only had fragments of real scenes from the actual script. And what, I die in STAB 3?
AND I DIE NAKED?! UGH! This is complete bullshit. Who wrote this piece of crap?
I know right. It was kinda weak. That's cause Will Kennison only wrote a rough treatment of it. The script was written by some new guy. He wrote Arlington Street.

Still that was a much better movie, I saw it at the premiere last week. God, what the hell am I getting sidetracked with this shit for?! We've gotta get down to business.
Shit! Where the hell are Tom and Angelina?
I don't know. Screw them. Look, what's important is that we stick together. No matter what. If anyone is next it's you or me Jen.
Who's phone?
Oh shit it's my cell!
Listen you sick bastard, what the fuck do you want?
What's your favorite scary movie Gale?
What's your favorite scary movie Gale?
I dunno but I can tell you that your's will be the home video footage of me sticking my foot up your ass! Now come out and fight like a real man you pussy!
God damn it you two! Run! Hurry! He's dead!
No! He's not dead! He's still breathing! Look!
Geez.
What the hell are you doing?

Being Gale Weathers. What the hell are you doing?

I am Gale Weathers!

Here's how I see it. I've got no house, no movie, no gun, and I'm being stalked. Because someone wants to kill me? No, because someone wants to kill you. So now, starting now, I go where you go. That way, if someone wants to kill me, I'll be with you, and since they really want to kill you, they won't kill me, they'll

Bitch.
Nobody said she was an actor.
Good twist.
Oh, Come on! You have made millions off the story of her murder. You're obsessed with HER and you're obsessed with her DAUGHTER!
Settle down Beavis. Why don't you tell us the truth?
I think Milton's the killer. I think he just went out to kill another cast member.
Milton's not a killer. He's a pervert. He probably went out to buy more KY JELLY for his jack -off parties he has with his two best friends.

Rob Reiner and Quentin Tarentino?

Do you get any of my witty humor? I mean, you did play me for three movies. His two hands, dingus.
Excuse me Detective, I think we have some business to attend to.
GALE WEATHERS?! What are you doing here? No press on the set! No press, no press on set! Get that woman out of here.
Well then, I guess I'll be leaving then.
Oh come on! Why the hostility?
Oh come on! Why the hostility?
Listen Lois Lane, I love your show and all but last month I happened to catch your little segment on me and how my wife left me because I'm a sex addict who enjoys screwing fifteen year old girls. It was a real eye opener my lawyers are still thinking about bringing to your superior's attentions.

They're the ones who approved it.
Answer the question. You knew Sidney's mom?
Who?
And now? I mean, murders on your set and still you say nothing?
Get real, that would make me a suspect!
Get real, that would make me a suspect!
Just because you knew her?

Yeah.
Yeah.
I don't think so! Just what happened to Maureen when she was in Hollywood?

Now you listen to me, Lois Lane, let it go. It's dead and buried. Daddy took ol' Yeller out behind the barn and shot him in the head a long time ago.

It was in the 70's, everything was different. I was well known for my parties, Rina knew what they were. It was for girls like her to meet men, men who could get them parts, if they made the right impression. Nothing happened to her that she didn't invite, in one way or another, no matter what she said afterwards.

Are you saying she was-
Are you saying she was-
I'm saying things got out of hand. Maybe they did take advantage of her!. Maybe the sad truth is, this is not the city for innocence. No charges were brought. And the bottom line is, Rina Reynolds wouldn't play by the rules. You wanna get ahead in Hollywood, you gotta play the game, or go home.
Gale Weathers. What a surprise.
Tom Prinze, tanked as usual. That's a shocker.

Hey I really liked that piece you did on me last month. The one where you said my car accident was caused by me drinking and drugs, and how I faked the tire blow-out just so my insurance wouldn't sky rocket.

Really, cause that stunt lost me the lead role in Roman Polanski's latest picture. Huh, what a coincide I was picked up by Roman Bridger. Well, not exactly the Roman I wanted. Get my point? STAB 3 is bullshit. Fuck, because of your big mouth I'm here, drinking piss water SCOTCH with Second rate fucking celebrities like Jennifer Jollie and yourself! Hey, I just
I think we should go inside. I have to have a talk with the cast. ALL OF YOU.
You mean what's left of us. Yeah I'm running on empty anyways. Gotta refuel.
Oh my God! Sidney, you ran fast or what? Hey.
Hi, Gale. I'm glad you're all right.
What'd he say?
Oh, you know, the usual small talk, "What's new, how ya been, how do you want to die?"
Oh my God Karen you scared the shit out of me! What are you doing here?
Who's this.
We did some researching in the archives. Sid, something dawned on me when I wrote the book on your mother's murder. For two years of her life, 1969 up until 1971 she basically disappeared off the face of the Earth.
What are you talking about?
Gale he's got Dewey!
I know! He killed Kincaid!
I know! He killed Kincaid!
I know!
I know!
Let's get out of here!
Let's get out of here!
GALE WATCHOUT!
Roman Bridger, director. And brother. She slammed the door in my face, Sid. Said I was Rina's child and Rina was dead. And it struck me, what a good idea! So I watched her, made a little home movie, a little family film. Seems Maureen, mom, really got around. I mean, Cotton Weary was one thing, everybody knew about that, but Billy's father, that

Oh my God, Angie Crick? From English class?
Listen, I have no time for this. I've heard this shit before! So lets get on with it!
Wait a second Sid. Don't you go jumping the gun. You haven't seen the best part. With the aides of the computer revolution of y2kI've been able to steal your voice. Ain't it cool? Listen to what the police are gonna find next to your lifeless, mutilated body.

I can't take it anymore. This Hollywood exploitation of the nightmare I lived has to be stopped. I did this to make you all repent for your sins, and now I'm pleased I've got my message across. Good-bye.
See Sid, now comes the part where we get away with it! The part where we win! Cause face it Sidney, in this world, the bad guys win!
Roman knock it off! Do you people even know why you kill people? You kill people cause you choose to and not because of any other fucking reason!
Oh shit. Hello? Director's office.
Sarah, it's Roman, I'm sorry I'm running late, I'm still on the 405, I'm about 10 minutes away.

What? What movie?
What? What movie?
My movie.
Goddamnit I am getting so fed up with these re-writes. It's like every five minutes there's a new script. God, and you just know this all because of STAB 2's script winding up on the internet two months after it wrapped shooting.
And still the film is Number One at the box office this weekend. Beat out American Pasty and Arlington Street.
What are you talking about? The murders were a completely isolated incident.
SCENE 32. INT. CANDY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT. "What are you talking about Ricky, the murders were a completely isolated incident".

I'm just saying, though. What if there's someone out there stalking actors? Huh? Then what?
Roman and everybody else went home for the night. I'm here for a make-up test.
Make-up. You need it. Hey, Roman isn't here?
Make-up. You need it. Hey, Roman isn't here?
No.
No.
Damn. He called my roommate and told her he had some important things he wanted to go over with me in his office tonight.
Do you think it's over Sidney? Do you?
W-what do you want?
W-what do you want?
I want to finish what I started. I want to finish the game.

Heh. So you think Sidney. So you think. It's all been building up to this Sid. Every STAB. Every SCREAM. Every ounce of blood that's been spilled has all been leading up to this moment. WELCOME TOTHE FINAL ACT.
Heh. So you think Sidney. So you think. It's all been building up to this Sid. Every STAB. Every SCREAM. Every ounce of blood that's been spilled has all been leading up to this moment. WELCOME TOTHE FINAL ACT.
The final act? Well let's play asshole!
The final act? Well let's play asshole!
No. We play in my court this time. Come to Hollywood. STAB 3's going to cutting corners cast-wise. And I've got my eyes set on a technical advisor named Dewey Rielly.
If you lay a hand on him I'll fucking kill you!
Great. A spirited one. I'll be seeing you real soon Sidney. Real soon.
{ a click } I only her you too, Sidney.
Who is this?
Who is this?
The question isn't who I am. The question is, who's with me.
Don't do it! If you do one thing to attract attention, one thing, I'll kill them both. Now, do you have somewhere we can be alone?
Yes.
Yes.
Go there.
Always hard being friends with you, Sidney. When you're friends with Sidney, you die! Well these friends don't have to, Sidney. It's up to you.
How do I know their voices are --
How do I know their voices are --
Are real? How do you know you're not hearing things? How do you know I'm not someone in your head? Somewhere, you know.
You're dead!
I don't want them, I want you! It's simple. You show yourself, they survive, you run, they die!
Where?
She'd have been so happy, Sidney, to know we'd be together.
She'd have been so happy, Sidney, to know we'd be together.
WHERE?
WHERE?
I'll call you, when you're on your way.
Yeah?
You follow directions good. Now let's wrap this production. Go to the Sunrise Studios backlot. I'll call you when you get there.
Alright, I'm here. Now what?
You're doing real good. Can't you figure it out? I wanna finish this where it all began. Woodsboro.
You're doing real good. Can't you figure it out? I wanna finish this where it all began. Woodsboro.
I thought you wanted me here?
Alright I'm here, now show your face so we can finish this.
It's good to see you again Sidney. I was growing real impatient. Go ahead. Explore. I'll catch up with you later.
Hello?
Yes, hi I'm Laura, I'm a trained counselor. How can I help you.
Yes, hi I'm Laura, I'm a trained counselor. How can I help you.
Laura I think I just killed somebody.
Laura I think I just killed somebody.
Are you sure?
Are you sure?
Uh-huh I'm sure. I've killed someone! OH MY GOD I'VE ACTUALLY KILLED SOMEONE!
Uh-huh I'm sure. I've killed someone! OH MY GOD I'VE ACTUALLY KILLED SOMEONE!
Well then the people you need to call are the police.
Well then the people you need to call are the police.
No I need to call you. Just you.
No I need to call you. Just you.
I'm sorry, your voice.
I'm sorry, your voice.
Don't you want to know how you can help, Sidney? Are you listening to me, huh?
Don't you want to know how you can help, Sidney? Are you listening to me, huh?
Who the fuck is this?
Who the fuck is this?
It's mother, Sidney, now be a good girl and turn on the news. DO IT!
What? She asked.
It's called tact, you fuckrag.
It's called tact, you fuckrag.
Sorry.
I didn't kill anybody.
No one's saying you did.
Owwww...
You open your mouth and stupidity pours out.
You open your mouth and stupidity pours out.
Sorry.
How'd you do?
Piece of cake. She'll be there.
Piece of cake. She'll be there.
Thanks, butt wart. You did good.
Thanks, butt wart. You did good.
So you gonna try and make up with Sid?
So you gonna try and make up with Sid?
Duh... that's quick.
Duh... that's quick.
I was just asking. Why are you always at me?
I was just asking. Why are you always at me?
Because I'm trying to build your self-esteem. You're far too sensitive.
Because I'm trying to build your self-esteem. You're far too sensitive.
Oh...
You ready to party hard tonight?
You know it.
Dude. What are you doing here?
I was hoping Sid and I could talk.
Where ya going? It's not over yet. We've got one more surprise -- Stu, I believe it's your turn.
Oh yeah.
You have to play, Sid. Don't want to disappoint your dad. He's been waiting around all night.
It's an easy game. We ask you a question. If you get it wrong -- you die.
It's an easy game. We ask you a question. If you get it wrong -- you die.
And if you get it right -- you die.
Tell that to Cotton Weary. You wouldn't believe how easy it was to frame him.
Yeah, we just watched a few movies. Took a few notes. It was fun.
Nope.
And did they really ever explain why Hannibal Lecter liked to eat people? Don't think so. You see, it's scarier when there's no motive, Sid.
Think about it. On the off chance I get caught -- a motive like that could divide a jury for years, don't you think?. You took my mother, so I took yours. Big sympathy factor. Maternal abandonment causes serious deviant behavior. It certainly fucked you up. It made you have sex with a psychopath.
That's right and now that you're no longer a virgin. You gotta die -- those are the rules.
This is the best part, Sid. Billy's got it all figured out. Why do you think we kept your father alive so long? Why did we save you for last?
You know what time it is, Sid? It's after midnight. It's your mother's anniversary. We killed her exactly one year ago today.
Ready?
Yeah...
What if your father snapped? Your mom's anniversary set him off and he went on a murder spree, killing everyone...
Except for me and Billy... we were left for dead...
Except for me and Billy... we were left for dead...
And then he killed you and then shoots himself in the head. It's a perfect ending.
And then he killed you and then shoots himself in the head. It's a perfect ending.
Everyone dies but us. We get to carry on and plan the sequel. Let's face it, these days -- you gotta have a sequel.
That's it, Billy. I can't take any more. I'm feeling woozy.
Get the gun. I'll untie Pops.
It's on the table.
No, it's not.
I thought she was dead.
She looked dead. Still does.
She can't get both of us.
Odds are -- she'll miss anyway.
I don't know Billy but I'm hurtin'.
Where the fuck did she go?
FIND HER YOU DIPSHIT!
I can't... I'm bad off, Billy. You cut too deep.
Thank you, Hank. We're on it. What were you doing out at Sidney's tonight?
I just wanted to see her, that's all.
I just wanted to see her, that's all.
You rode your bike out there?
You rode your bike out there?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
And last night? Sidney said you crawled through her window last night too?
Did you ride past Casey Becker's house?
No, I didn't. I didn't kill anyone, Sheriff.
No, I didn't. I didn't kill anyone, Sheriff.
We're gonna have to keep you, Billy. The governor's got SBI, FBI, and god knows who else on their way down here.
Billy? What the...
I'm sorry. Don't hate me.
I'm sorry. Don't hate me.
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
You sleep in THAT?
My dad's in the other room.
I'll only stay a sec.
Close call.
What are you doing here?
It just occurred to me that I've never snuck through your bedroom window.
Now that it's out of your system.
Now that it's out of your system.
And I was home, bored, watching television, THE EXORCIST was on and it got me thinking of you.
And I was home, bored, watching television, THE EXORCIST was on and it got me thinking of you.
Oh it did?
Oh it did?
Yeah, it was edited for TV. All the good stuff was cut out and I started thinking about us and how two years ago, we started off kinda hot and heavy, a nice solid "R" rating on our way to an NC17. And how things have changed and, lately, we're just sot of... edited for television.

So you thought you could sneak in my window and we would have a little bump-bump.
So you thought you could sneak in my window and we would have a little bump-bump.
No, no. I wouldn't dream of breaking your underwear rule. I just thought we might do some on top of the clothes stuff.
You know what my dad will do to you?
I'm going... I'm going.
Would you settle for a PG-13 relationship?
What's that?
Oh Billy... Please... God...
I heard screaming. The door was locked. Are you okay...
I heard screaming. The door was locked. Are you okay...
He's here. He's trying to kill me...
Jesus, SHIT!
Hey, hey, it's just me.
No... I don't... it's just... Oh God, Billy, someone was there, someone tried to kill me.
The police say I scared him off. It wasn't me, Sid.

See, it couldn't have been me. I was in jail, remember?
I'm so sorry... please understand.
I'm so sorry... please understand.
Understand what? That I got a girlfriend who would rather accuse me of being a psychopathic killer than touch me.

Is it the sex thing? Am I being too pushy?

No, it's me, Billy. I need time. I'm still adjusting to my mom.
No, it's me, Billy. I need time. I'm still adjusting to my mom.
It's been a year since she died.
It's been a year since she died.
Tomorrow. One year tomorrow.

When are you gonna let that go, Sid? When my mom left my dad -- I just accepted it. This is the way it is. She's not coming back.
When are you gonna let that go, Sid? When my mom left my dad -- I just accepted it. This is the way it is. She's not coming back.
Your parents split up. It's not the same thing. Your mom left town, she's not in a coffin somewhere.
Your parents split up. It's not the same thing. Your mom left town, she's not in a coffin somewhere.
You have to move on, Sid.
Subtlety, Stu. Look it up.
It's okay. We need to talk.
So...
So... I'm sorry. I've been a selfish shit and I'm sorry.
So... I'm sorry. I've been a selfish shit and I'm sorry.
No, Billy. I'm the one who's been selfish and self-absorbed with all of my post traumatic stress.
No, Billy. I'm the one who's been selfish and self-absorbed with all of my post traumatic stress.
You lost your mom...
You lost your mom...
But you're right -- enough is enough. I can't wallow in the grief process forever and I can't keep lying to myself about who my mom was.
I think in some weird analytical, psychological bullshit way I'm scared I'm gonna turn out just like her, you know? Like the bad seed or something...
Oh Sidney...
Oh Sidney...
Everytime I get close to you I see my mom. I know it doesn't make sense.
Everytime I get close to you I see my mom. I know it doesn't make sense.
Sure it does. It's like Jodie Foster in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS when she kept having flashbacks of her dead father.

But this is life. This isn't a movie.
But this is life. This isn't a movie.
Sure it is, Sid. It's all a movie. Life's one great big movie. Only you can't pick your genre.
I wanna let go. I do...
Ssshh... everything's gonna be okay. I promise.
Sshh... it's okay.
Or even a good porno.
Or even a good porno.
What?
You heard me.

Yeah... and when I called no one answered.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
You don't still think it was me?
You don't still think it was me?
No, but if it were you, that would have been a very clever way to throw me off track. Using your one phone call to call me so I wouldn't think it was you.
I thought you were...
I'm alright. Gotta... get... help.
NO! Don't believe him.
It's okay. Give me the gun.
It's called GUESS HOW I'M GOING TO DIE!
Fuck you.
Fuck you.
We already played that game. You lost, remember?
Why did you kill my mother?
Why? WHY? Did you hear that, Stu? I think she wants a motive. Hmmm... I don't really believe in motives, Sid. I mean, did Norman Bates have a motive?
I don't understand...
We did your mom a favor, Sid. The woman was a slut bag whore who flashed her shit all over town like she was Sharon Stone or something.
Jesus... fuck, that hurt.
Stop it!
Stop it!
Got the ending figured out yet? Time's running out.
Hello?
Are you alone in the house?
You bitch -- where the fuck are you?
Not so fast. We're gonna play a little game. It's called GUESS WHO JUST CALLED THE POLICE AND REPORTED YOUR SORRY MOTHERFUCKING ASS?

Or else what?

It was Jason. I saw that goddamned movie twenty times. It was Jason.
It was Jason. I saw that goddamned movie twenty times. It was Jason.
Then you should know Jason's MOTHER -- Mrs. Vorhees was the original killer. Jason didn't show up until the sequel.
You tricked me...
Lucky, for you there's a bonus round. But poor Steve... I'm afraid... he's out.
...leave me alone... please...
Answer the question and I will.
What door am I at?
What?
What?
There are two doors to your house. A front door and a back one. If you answer correctly -- you live.
Don't make me... I can't... I won't.
Your call.
Hi! Gale Weathers. Field Correspondent, INSIDE STORY.
I know who you are, ma'am. How's the eye?
I know who you are, ma'am. How's the eye?
Productive. So they're closing down the school?

Well... uh... yes ma'am. For the time being.
And why is that? Has something happened?
You're not supposed to be here, ma'am.
You're not supposed to be here, ma'am.
I know, I should be in New York covering the Sharon Stone stalker but who knew? Please, call me Gale. You look awfully young to be a police officer.
I'm twenty-five years old, ma'am.
Twenty-five, huh? In a demographic study I proved to be most popular amongst males, 11-24. I just missed you. Of course, you don't look a day over twelve, except in the upper torso area. Does the force require that you work out?
Boy, you people sure do make fuss over a serial killer.
Serial killer is not really accurate, ma'am. The killer has yet to strike twice.

Well, we can hope, can't we? We certainly don't have any leads. A ghost mask, a cellular phone -- not much there.

What about Gale Weathers? I sound like a meteorologist...
People treat me like the Antichrist of television journalism.
I don't think you're so bad.
Shit. It's Neil Prescott's car.
Sidney's father?
Sidney's father?
We gotta get back. Jesus. He's here. What the fuck is he doing here?
I'll call for backup.
I'll get my camera.
What are you doing here?
Oh, God, Sid, I'm sorry I was late.
Oh, God, Sid, I'm sorry I was late.
You can't be here, Tatum. This is an official crime scene.
Does mom know?
Yes, you doofus.
Hey... Dewey. Can we go now?
Hold up a sec...
What did Mama tell you? When I wear this badge you treat me like a man of the law.
I'm sorry, Deputy Dewey-boy but we're ready to go.
A party? Mom's gonna kill you. Then me.
Don't be so self-righteous. It's just a little blow out -- we'll be perfectly safe.
No, Dewey. You'll ruin the whole night.
Sorry, police orders. I'll stay out of the way, I promise.
Sorry, police orders. I'll stay out of the way, I promise.
Shit.
What is she doing here?
She's with me. I just wanted to check on things.
You gonna be able to come down to the station and talk to us a bit?
...yeah...
Did you reach my Dad?
You're sure it was the Hilton?
You're sure it was the Hilton?
At the airport.

He's not registered. Could he have gone to another hotel?
He's not registered. Could he have gone to another hotel?
I don't know. I guess.
I don't know. I guess.
We'll find him, Sid. Don't worry.
Any word on my Dad?
Not yet, but we're looking. If you need anything...
Billy was released. His cellular bill was clean. He didn't make those calls.
Somebody called me, Dewey. I'm not making it up.
Somebody called me, Dewey. I'm not making it up.

And my Dad? Any word on him?
God, look at this place, it's THE TOWN THAT DREADED SUNDOWN.
Hey, I saw that movie. True story, 'bout some killer in Texas.
I see you as a young Meg Ryan myself.
Thanks, Dewey. But with my luck they'd cast Tori Spelling.
You girls ready.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Looks like I'm your personal bodyguard tonight, Sid.
Have they found my father?
Afraid not.
Afraid not.
Should I be worried?
Should I be worried?
Not yet.
It's Deputy Riley today, Sid.
How is everything?
We got him, Sheriff. Billy Loomis.
Hank Loomis' kid? Aw... Jesus...
Hank Loomis' kid? Aw... Jesus...
He's her boyfriend.
I was first to respond.
What were you doing out here?
What were you doing out here?
Drive by patrol.
Drive by patrol.
How is she?
How is she?
She's tough.
She's tough.
Have to be. The shit she's gone through.
That ghost mask is sold at both Kroger's and WalMart. Neither of which keep purchase records.
What about the cellular phone bill?
What about the cellular phone bill?
They're pulling Loomis' account. But it'll be morning before we see something. You think he did it?
They're pulling Loomis' account. But it'll be morning before we see something. You think he did it?
Twenty years ago I woulda said not a chance. But these kids today... damn if I know.
She staying with you?
We haven't located her Dad yet.
She's okay. Looks like some boys were teasing her. Himbry's shutting down the school though. I want you to take look around.
Yes, sir, sheriff.
Dewey! Where the hell you been, boy?
Keeping my eye on Sidney.
Keeping my eye on Sidney.
Listen up, Dewey, because it's bad. Real bad. Aircomp just faxed us. The calls were listed to Neil Prescott -- Sidney's father. He made the calls with his cellular phone. It's confirmed.

Have you contacted the bureau?
Have you contacted the bureau?
They believe he's out of state by now. We'll keep roadblocks and curfew in effect through the night. If he's not picked up by morning -- we'll do a house to house.

Watch her. Don't let on -- just keep your eyes out.
Yes, sir.
That fish smelled strong.
I told you to send it back.
Jesus...
What is it? Where's Casey?
What is it? Where's Casey?
Casey? Casey?
Where is she?
Call the police.
Casey? Where are you honey? Call the police, goddamnit.
The phone's dead.
Where is she?
I can hear her. Oh Mother of God, I can hear her.
Casey! Casey!
Not my daughter... not my...
What? What?
Jesus! The camera-hurry!
Jesus Christ! An innocent man on death row. A killer still on the loose. Kenny, tell me I'm dreaming.
You want to go live?
No, not so fast. We have nothing concrete.
When did that ever stop you? You can't sit on this. This is huge.
When did that ever stop you? You can't sit on this. This is huge.
If I'm gonna blow this up -- I need hard proof.

But it's so much easier when we make it up.
But it's so much easier when we make it up.
Not this time. I owe Cotton that much. Hell, even I thought that man was guilty.
What's the plan?
Prep the compact, we'll hide it in a window and tape all of tonight's festivities.
The control board's glitched. You know we can't carry a live picture.
What's the delay?
What's the delay?
About thirty seconds.
About thirty seconds.
As long as it records I don't give a shit. We're not doing a remote.
It's okay, Tatum. She's just doing her job. Right, GALE?
Yes, that's right.
How's the book?
It'll be out later this year.
I'll look for it.
I'll send you a copy.
I'm not here to fight.
Just stay back.
Just stay back.
I want to talk to you.
I want to talk to you.
Kenny. Camera. Now.
Off the record. No cameras.
Forget it.
Please. You owe me.
I owe you shit.
You owe my mother.
Your mother's murder was last year's hottest court case. Somebody was gonna write a book about it.
Your mother's murder was last year's hottest court case. Somebody was gonna write a book about it.
And it had to be you with all your lies and bullshit theories.
And it had to be you with all your lies and bullshit theories.
What is your problem? You got what you wanted. Cotton Weary is in jail. They're gonna gas him. A book is not gonna change that.
What is your problem? You got what you wanted. Cotton Weary is in jail. They're gonna gas him. A book is not gonna change that.
Do you still think he's innocent?
He was convicted in a court of law. Your testimony put him away. It doesn't matter what I think.
During the trial, you did all those stories about me. You called me a liar.
During the trial, you did all those stories about me. You called me a liar.
I think you falsely identified him. Yes.
I think you falsely identified him. Yes.
Have you talked to Cotton?
Have you talked to Cotton?
Many times.
Many times.
Has his story changed?
Has his story changed?
Not one word. He admits to having sex with your mother but that's all.
Not one word. He admits to having sex with your mother but that's all.
He's lying. She wouldn't have touched him. He raped her, then butchered her. Her blood was all over his coat.
He's lying. She wouldn't have touched him. He raped her, then butchered her. Her blood was all over his coat.
He was drunk that night. He left his coat at your house, after your mother seduced him...
He was drunk that night. He left his coat at your house, after your mother seduced him...
I saw him leaving wearing it.
I saw him leaving wearing it.
But couldn't it have been someone else you saw wearing that coat? The same person who planted it in Cotton's car, framing him? The same person who really killed your mother?
She was never attacked. I think she made it all up.
Why would she lie about it?
Why would she lie about it?
For attention. The girl has some serious issues.
What if she did it? What if Sidney killed Casey and Steve?
And why would she do that?
And why would she do that?
Maybe she was hot for Steve and killed them both in a jealous rage.
Why would Sidney want to be with Steve? She has her own bubble-butt boyfriend Billy.
Maybe she's a slut just like her mom.
You're evil.
Please, it's common knowledge. Her mother was a trollop.
Cut some slack. She watched her mom get butchered.
And it fucked her up royally. Think about it. It makes perfect sense. Her mom's death leaves her distraught and hostile at a cruel and inhumane world, she's disillusioned, where's God, etc. Completely suicidal. And one day she snaps. She wants to kill herself but realizes teen suicide is out this year. And homicide is a much healthier therapeutic expression.
Where do you get this shit?
Ricki Lake.
I have no idea.
Scary night, isn't it? With the murders and all, it's like right out of a horror movie or something.

Don't start. You know I don't watch that shit.
Don't start. You know I don't watch that shit.
And why is that?
And why is that?
Because they're all the same. It's always some stupid killer stalking some big breasted girl -- who can't act -- who always runs up the stairs when she should be going out the front door. They're ridiculous.
Are you alone in the house?
That is so unoriginal. You disappoint me, Randy.
That is so unoriginal. You disappoint me, Randy.
Maybe that's because I'm not Randy.
Maybe that's because I'm not Randy.
So who are you?

The question is not who am I. The question is where am I?
The question is not who am I. The question is where am I?
So where are you?
So where are you?
Your front porch.
Why would you call me from my front porch?
That's the original part.
So where are you?
Right here.
Can you see me right now?
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
What am I doing?
Good try, Randy. Tell Tatum to hurry. Bye now.
If you hang up, you'll die just like your mother.
Hello?
Hello Sidney.
Poor Billy-boyfriend. An innocent guy doesn't stand a chance with you.
LEAVEMEALONE!
LEAVEMEALONE!
Looks like you fingered the wrong guy... again.

Can you knock?
I heard screaming.
I heard screaming.
No you didn't.
No you didn't.
No? Oh, well... I'm hitting the sack. My flight leaves first thing in the morning. Now the expo runs all weekend so I won't be back til Sunday. There's cash on the table and I'll be staying at the Raleigh Hilton...
No? Oh, well... I'm hitting the sack. My flight leaves first thing in the morning. Now the expo runs all weekend so I won't be back til Sunday. There's cash on the table and I'll be staying at the Raleigh Hilton...
...out at the airport...
...out at the airport...
...so call if you need me.
...so call if you need me.
Got it.
Have a good trip.
Sleep tight, sweetie.
Stu was with me last night.
Oooooh... before or after he sliced and diced.
Oooooh... before or after he sliced and diced.
Fuck you, nut case. Where were you last night?
Fuck you, nut case. Where were you last night?
Working, thank you.
Working, thank you.
I thought Blockbuster fired you.
I thought Blockbuster fired you.
Twice.
THE FOG, TERROR TRAIN, PROM NIGHT -- How come Jamie Lee Curtis is in all these movies?
She's the Scream Queen.
Stop. Right there.
Don't shoot. It's me.
Don't shoot. It's me.
Don't come any closer.
Don't come any closer.
Listen to me, Sid. I found Tatum. She's dead, she's been killed... I think Stu did it.
Only if it's a nice Meg Ryan movie.
You got it.
That was an ice pick -- not exactly the same.
Yeah, Casey and Steve were completely hollowed out. Takes a man to do something like that.
For about two seconds.
Before she dumped him for Steve.
And are the police aware you dated the victim?
What are you saying? That I killed her or something?
What are you saying? That I killed her or something?
It would certainly improve your high school Q.
Besides -- "Takes a man to do something like that."
I'm gonna gut your ass in a second.
I'm gonna gut your ass in a second.
Did you really put her liver in the mailbox? I hear they found her liver in the mailbox.
Jesus, this place is packed.
We had a run in the mass murder section.

You coming tonight?
You coming tonight?
Yeah, I'm off early -- curfew you know. Now that's poor taste.
Yeah, I'm off early -- curfew you know. Now that's poor taste.
What?
If you were the only suspect in a senseless bloodbath would you be standing in the horror section?
It was all a misunderstanding. He didn't do anything.
It was all a misunderstanding. He didn't do anything.
You're such a little lap dog. He's got killer printed all over his forehead.
You're such a little lap dog. He's got killer printed all over his forehead.
The why'd the police let him go?
The why'd the police let him go?
Because, obviously they don't watch enough movies. This is standard horror movie stuff. PROM NIGHT revisited.
Why would he want to kill his own girlfriend?
There's always some stupid bullshit reason to kill your girlfriend. That's the beauty of it all. Simplicity. Besides, if it's too complicated you lose your target audience.

So what's his reason?

Maybe Sidney wouldn't have sex with him.
Maybe Sidney wouldn't have sex with him.
She's saving herself for you.

Could be. Now that Billy's tried to mutilate her, you think Sid would go out with me?
Could be. Now that Billy's tried to mutilate her, you think Sid would go out with me?
I think her father did it. How come they can't find his ass?
I think her father did it. How come they can't find his ass?
Because he's probably dead. His body will come popping out in the last reel somewhere... eyes gauged. See, the police are always off track with this shit, if they'd watch PROM NIGHT they'd save time. There's formula to it. A very simple one. Everyone's always a suspect -- the father, the principal, the town derelict...

Which is you...
Which is you...
So while they're off investigating a dead end, Billy, who's been written off as a suspect, is busy planning his next hunting expedition.
You're absolutely right. I'm the first to admit it. If this were a scary movie, I'd be the prime suspect.
And what would be your motive?
And what would be your motive?
It's 1995 -- motives are incidental.
I thought everything was checked out.
I had 'em hid in the foreign section.
We could be like two grief stricken students and we'll say really nice things about our good friends who were slaughtered senselessly.
I can cry on cue.
What's Leatherface doing here?
He came to make up.
He came to make up.
There goes my chance with Sid.
There goes my chance with Sid.
Like you had one.
I wanna see Jamie Lee's breasts. When do we see Jamie Lee's breasts?
Not until TRADING PLACES in '83. Jamie Lee was always the virgin in horror movies. She didn't show her tits until she went legit.
There are certain rules that one must abide by in order to successfully survive a horror movie. For instance: 1. You can never have sex. The minute you get a little nookie -- you're as good as gone. Sex always equals death. 2. Never drink or do drugs. The sin factor. It's an extension of number one. And 3. Never, ever, ever, under any
Wanna another beer?
Wanna another beer?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'll be right back.
His movie nut mind has snapped, Sid. He's gone psycho.
Don't listen to him. It's him. He's the one.
Come on, Sid. Give me the gun.
No, Sid.
You heard Billy -- shut the fuck up.
Hey, Stu? Didn't you use to date Casey?
Why are they doing this?
Are you kidding? This is like Christmas.
And to celebrate this impromptu fall break, I propose we have a party. Tonight, my house.
Are you serious?
Are you serious?
My parents are out of town. It'll be like my hurricane bash last year. Nothing extreme. Just a few of us, hangin'.
Remember, there's safety in numbers.
Yeah, okay... whatever.
Yeah, okay... whatever.
Cool. See you guys tonight. Bring food.
If Tatum sees you -- she'll draw blood.
You guys can go up to my parents room? To talk and... whatever.
Guess, I won't be needing this anymore.
Why are you doing this?
Why are you doing this?
It's all part of the game.
You're crazy -- both of you.
The official term is "psychotic".
The official term is "psychotic".
You'll never get away with this.
So Stu, what's your motive? Billy's got one. The police are on their way. What are you going to tell them?
Peer pressure... I'm way to sensitive.
Do you believe this shit?
What happened?
Oh God! You don't know? Casey Becker and Steve Forrest were killed last night.
No way.
No way.
And not just killed, Sid. We're talking splatter movie killed-split open end to end.
And not just killed, Sid. We're talking splatter movie killed-split open end to end.
Casey Becker? She sits next to me in English.
Casey Becker? She sits next to me in English.
Not anymore. Her parents found her hanging from a tree. Her insides on the outside.

Do they know who did it?

Fucking clueless -- they're interrogating the entire school. Teachers, students, staff, janitors...

They think it's school-related?

They don't know. Dewey said this is the worst crime they've ever seen. Even worse than... Well it's bad. They're bringing in the feds. This is big.
Or a man's mentality.
How do you gut someone?
You sure I can stay over? My dad won't be back til Sunday.
No prob. I'll pick you up after practice.
No prob. I'll pick you up after practice.
Tell your mom I said thanks.
Tell your mom I said thanks.
Yeah, yeah... are you okay?
Yeah, yeah... are you okay?
Uh-huh, it's just... you know, the police and reporters... it brings it all back.
Uh-huh, it's just... you know, the police and reporters... it brings it all back.
I'll be there by seven. I promise
I'll be there by seven. I promise
Thanks, Tatum.
Thanks, Tatum.
Later.
Practice ran late. I'm on my way.
It's past seven.
It's past seven.
Don't worry. Casey and Steve didn't bite it til way after ten.
Don't worry. Casey and Steve didn't bite it til way after ten.
I'm not worried.
I'm not worried.
Good, 'cause I wanna swing by BLOCKBUSTER and get us a video. I was thinkin' Tom Cruise in ALL THE RIGHT MOVES. You know, if you pause it just right you can see his penis.

Whatever. Just hurry.
Whatever. Just hurry.
Bye.
It's okay. She was supposed to pick me up.
Her dad's out of town. She's staying with us.
Just another sleepover at the Riley's.
Just like old times, ain't it?
Just like old times, ain't it?
No, nothing's like it used to be.
Do you really think Billy did it?
He was there, Tatum.
He was there, Tatum.
I knew this guy was too perfect. He was destined to have a flaw.
Take a message.
It's alright. I'll get it.
Come on, Sid.
Just a sec... I need to talk to someone.
Just relax. You're at school now. No one can get you here.
But if it wasn't Billy it could be anybody. He could be here at school right now.
This is a mistake. I shouldn't be here.
I want you to meet me here right after class, okay?
Shit, what is he doing here?
I bet he's pissed.
I bet he's pissed.
Just ignore him. You had good reason to think what you did.
It was just some sick fuck having a laugh.
It was him, Tatum. I know it.
This could be good. What do you think, Sid?
I don't know...
I don't know...
Come on. Pathos has it's perks.
Maybe Cotton Weary is telling the truth. Maybe he was having an affair with your mom.
So you think my mom was a slut too?
So you think my mom was a slut too?
I didn't say that, Sid. But you know there were rumors. Your dad was always out of town on business. Maybe your mom was a very unhappy woman.
I didn't say that, Sid. But you know there were rumors. Your dad was always out of town on business. Maybe your mom was a very unhappy woman.
If they were having an affair how come that Cotton couldn't prove it in court?

It goes further back, Sid. There's been talk about other men.
It goes further back, Sid. There's been talk about other men.
And you believe it?
And you believe it?
Well... you can only hear that Richard Gere-gerbil story so many times before you have to start believing it.
If I was wrong Cotton, then he's still out there.
Don't go there, Sid. You're starting to sound like some Wes Carpenter flick. Don't freak yourself out -- we've got a long night ahead of us.
Don't go there, Sid. You're starting to sound like some Wes Carpenter flick. Don't freak yourself out -- we've got a long night ahead of us.
You're right. I'm cracking up. Ignore me.
You're right. I'm cracking up. Ignore me.
Come on, let's rock.
Hey, Sid. Just think if they make a movie about you. Who's gonna play you?
Oh, god...
Is Billy going to be there tonight?
He better not be. I told Stu to keep his mouth shut. I think we can live without EVERYBODY'S ALL AMERICAN for one night.
Billy's right. Whenever he touches me, I just can't relax.
You have a few intimacy issues as a result of your mother's untimely death. It's no big deal. You'll thaw out.
You have a few intimacy issues as a result of your mother's untimely death. It's no big deal. You'll thaw out.
But he's been so patient with me, Tatum. You know, with all the sex stuff. How many guys would put up with a girlfriend who's sexually anorexic?
But he's been so patient with me, Tatum. You know, with all the sex stuff. How many guys would put up with a girlfriend who's sexually anorexic?
Billy and his penis don't deserve you.
What do you think about when you're having sex?
With Stu, there's little time to stop and reflect. But sometimes before, to relax and get in the mood, I think about Grant Goodeve.
Who?
Grant Goodeve -- the oldest brother on EIGHT IS ENOUGH. Remember that show? He was the one who lived off alone. He would come around every now and then with his guitar and sing "Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..." He had all these brain dead sisters and that idiot brother from CHARLES IN CHARGE. God, I was in love with

How does that get you in the mood with Stu?

During foreplay, I sing the theme song to myself. "Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..." It's a real turn on.
During foreplay, I sing the theme song to myself. "Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..." It's a real turn on.
No way.
No way.
Grant wrote the song himself. I'm convinced the lyrics had a secret meaning, "Eight is enough..."
What secret meaning? Like a Satanical thing?
Watch the show, Sid. His basket is bigger than the one you're pushing.
Watch the show, Sid. His basket is bigger than the one you're pushing.
TATUM!
TATUM!
Oh, Sidney. WHAT? A guy can talk tits til he's dead but the minute you mention an eight inch weenie. Watch out.
There's that sense of humor. I knew it still existed. Ohh, Sid, let's have some fun tonight.
Deal.
Hunt? Why would they ask if you like to hunt?
I don't know, they just did.
Because there's no way a girl could have killed them.
That is so sexist. The killer could easily be female -- BASIC INSTINCT.
I thought you dumped her for me.
I did. He's full of shit.
You know if I were accused of carving up two people, I'd take the opportunity to skip school.
Hey, go easy, Tatum. He didn't do it.
Is this not cool or what? Hey, Sid, what happened?
For once, Stu, drop it.
For once, Stu, drop it.
Okay, but whatever you did -- the entire student body thanks you.
That's mature.
Where you guys been? We had to start without you.
With that set of lungs -- she should be.
Tits -- see.
I got it. Tatum get me a beer. They're in the fridge in the garage.
What am I? The beer wench?
What am I? The beer wench?
Hey, guess who's here? It's that chick from INSIDE STORY?
I don't have anyone else to give this to, Somerset, you know that. And nobody's going to swap with you.
Give it to me.
Give it to me.
How's that?
How's that?
There's nothing that says I have to work with him. If Somerset wants out, "goodbye." Give it to me.
That's not necessary. You're in.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Go start picking up the pieces. We'll shuffle some paper and try to get you a new partner.
He cuts off the skin if his fingertips. That's why we can't find a single usable print in the apartment. He's been doing it for quite a while. Keeps cutting before the papillary line can grow back.
What about the trace on his bank account and the guns? There must be something to connect him with a past.
What about the trace on his bank account and the guns? There must be something to connect him with a past.
So far it's all dead ends. No credit history. No employment history. His bank account's only five years old and it started as cash. We're even trying to trace his furniture, but for now all we know is he's independently wealth, well educated and totally insane. We may never know how he got that way.
You don't. It goes to court now.
He wouldn't just turn himself in. It doesn't make any sense.
He's pissing in our faces again and we're just taking it.
You're wound too tight, Mills. Let it go.
How is it working for a scumbag like this? You proud of yourself?
Ease back, Mills.
What do you think?
I'm in.
"Dear Detectives, Long is the way, and hard, that out of hell leads up to light." It's the murderer's way of announcing himself.
Announcing what?
Announcing what?
There are seven deadly sins. Gluttony, wrath, greed...
There are seven deadly sins. Gluttony, wrath, greed...
So what? This victim...
So what? This victim...
... envy, sloth, pride and lust. Seven.
... envy, sloth, pride and lust. Seven.
Hey, so gluttony is one of the seven deadly sins. But, this was a fat guy. The killer may have felt this was the just best way to torture him. And, writing on the walls happens all the time. It's like the fashionable thing to do.

One is gluttony.
What's this: "I'm declining this case?" It don't work that way.
This can't be my last duty here. It will go on and on.
This can't be my last duty here. It will go on and on.
I know what you're thinking, okay? You don't want to get in bed with this every night, but it's different now. You're retiring. In six days you're all the way gone.
You've left unfinished business before.
Everything else was taken as close to conclusion as humanly possible. Also... this shouldn't be his first assignment.
Have you heard?
No, I haven't heard.
No, I haven't heard.
There was a second.
Already.
Greed. It was written in blood.
It's none of my business anymore.
I thought you might want to be filled in.
I thought you might want to be filled in.
I'm sure everyone's doing their best.
I'm sure everyone's doing their best.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Good.
Come on. What are you going to do with yourself out there?
I'll get a job, maybe on a farm. I'll work on the house.
I'll get a job, maybe on a farm. I'll work on the house.
Can't you feel it yet? Can't you feel that feeling... ? You're not going to be a cop anymore.
Can't you feel it yet? Can't you feel that feeling... ? You're not going to be a cop anymore.
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
You know.
Did you read in the paper today, about the man who was walking his dog? he was attacked, and his wallet and his watch were taken. And then, while he was still lying unconscious, his attacker stabbed him with a knife in both eyes. It happened four blocks from here.
I heard.
I heard.
I have no understanding of this place anymore.
I have no understanding of this place anymore.
It's always been like this.
It's always been like this.
Really?
Well, there he sits. It's not supposed to make sense.
He's not finished.
How you feeling?
I can breathe withour pain now, so I guess I feel great.
Thank you. Tell them, thank you.
We figure you need all the tools you can get to fix up that piece of shit you call a house.
We figure you need all the tools you can get to fix up that piece of shit you call a house.
Yeah, that's true.
They're hoping you stop and say goodbye before you go, but I told them not to expect it.
It would be too hard.
He's being arraigned tomorrow.
I read about it in the paper.
I guess... decide for yourself. I don't know what it says. I'm going to go.
I'll see you.
And... and... and he said... he asked me if I was married. And, I could see he had a gun in his hand.
Where was the girl?
Where was the girl?
What? What?
What? What?
Where was the prostitute? Where was she?
She was... she was on the bed. She was just sitting on the bed.
Who tied her down? You or him?
Who tied her down? You or him?
He had a gun. He had a gun... and he made it happen. He made me do it! He made me put that... that thing on. Oh, Christ! He made me wear it... and... and he told me to fuck her. He had the gun in my mouth.
Jesus Christ, man, don't shoot me!
Turn around. Hands on your head!
Turn around. Hands on your head!
What the hell's going on?
What the hell's going on?
Who are you? What are you doing out here?
Who are you? What are you doing out here?
I'm... I'm just delivering a package.
This guy paid me five hundred bucks to bring it out here. He wanted it here at exactly seven o'clock.
Put it down. Put it on the ground.
Put it down. Put it on the ground.
Okay...
I don't believe it.
Hello.
What do you mean?
I mean, at this point, what would it hurt if you told us a little about yourself?
I mean, at this point, what would it hurt if you told us a little about yourself?
It doesn't matter who I am. Who I am means absolutely nothing. You need to turn left here... at the traffic light.
What's so exciting?
It's not too far away now.
What time is it?
Why?
It's surprising how easily a member of the press can purchase information from the men in your precinct.
David... please...
David... please...
I visited your home this morning, after you left.
Give me the gun.
Her pretty head.
You didn't know.
NO!
Where we headed?
You'll see.
We're not just going to pick up two more bodies, are we, Johnny? That wouldn't be... shocking enough. Wouldn't keep you on the front page of the newspapers.
Wanting people to pay attention, you can't just tap them on the shoulder. You have to hit them in the head with a sledgehammer. Then, you have their strict attention.

I hate to burst your bubble, but other than the fact that you're especially sadistic, there's nothing unusual about these precious murders of yours.

You know that's not true.
You know that's not true.
In two months, no one's going to even remember this happened.
You can't see the whole... the whole complete act yet. Not yet. But, when this is done, it's going to be... so... so...
Spit it out.
Spit it out.
It's going to be flawless. People will barely be able to comprehend it. It will seem almost surreal... but it will have a tangible reality, so they won't be able to deny it.
I can't wait for you to see. I can't wait... It's really going to be something.
Well, I'll be standing beside you the whole time, so you be sure to let me know when this whole, complete reality thing is done. Wouldn't want to miss it.
Well, I'll be standing beside you the whole time, so you be sure to let me know when this whole, complete reality thing is done. Wouldn't want to miss it.
Oh, don't worry. You won't...
I... I doubt I enjoyed it any more than... Detective Mills would enjoy some time alone with me in a room without windows. Isn't that true? How happy would it make you to hurt me, with impunity?
Now... I wouldn't do something like that, Johnny. I like you. I like you a lot.
Now... I wouldn't do something like that, Johnny. I like you. I like you a lot.
You wouldn't because you know there are consequences. It's in those eyes of yours, though... nothing wrong with a man taking pleasure in his work. I won't deny my own personal desire to turn each sin against the sinner. I only took their sins to logical conclusions.

Innocent? Is that supposed to be funny? Look at the people I killed. An obese man, a disgusting man who could barely stand up... who if you saw him on the street, you'd point so your friends could mock him along with you. Who if you saw him while you were eating, you wouldn't be able to finish your meal. After him I picked

We would have gotten you eventually.
We would have gotten you eventually.
Really? Just biding your time, then? Toying with me. Is that it? Letting five people die until you finally felt like going out and hauling me in?
Tell me what it was that gave me away. What was the piece of evidence you were going to use against me right before I walked up to YOU and put my hands in the air.
I seem to remember knocking on your door.
I seem to remember knocking on your door.
And, I remember breaking your nose. You're only alive because I didn't kill you.
And, I remember breaking your nose. You're only alive because I didn't kill you.
Sit back.
Just keep leading the way.
It's close.
I wish I could have been a normal man like you. I wish I could have a simple life.
What the fuck is going on here?!
You've made a good life for yourself...
Shut up!
Here he comes.
What the fuck is going on?
What the fuck is going on?
I want you to know, I wish I could have lived like you do.
Somerset...
Because I envy your normal life. Envy is my sin.
I'm a little thrown. I just got in town like twenty minutes ago and they dumped me here.
Since we're just starting out, I thought we could go to a bar... sit and talk for awhile. After that, we'll...
Since we're just starting out, I thought we could go to a bar... sit and talk for awhile. After that, we'll...
Actually, if it's all the same, I'd like to get to the precinct house a.s.a.p. Seeing how we don't have much time for this whole transition thing.
I need to start getting the feel of it all, right? Meet the people.
I meant to ask you something, Mills, when we spoke on the phone. I can't help wondering... why here?
I meant to ask you something, Mills, when we spoke on the phone. I can't help wondering... why here?
I... I don't follow.
I... I don't follow.
All this effort you've made to get transferred, it's the first question that pops into my head.
All this effort you've made to get transferred, it's the first question that pops into my head.
I'm here for the same reasons as you, I guess. Or, at least, the same reasons you used to have for being here before... before you decided to... quit.
You just met me.
Maybe I'm not understanding the question.

It's very simple. You worked a nice, quiet town, but you fought to get here as if your life depended on it. I've just never seen it done that way before, Detective.

Maybe I thought I could do more good here than there. I don't know. Look, it'd be great by me if we didn't start right off kicking each other in the balls. But, you're calling the shots, Lieutenant, so... however you want it to go.

I wasn't standing around guarding the local Taco Bell. I've worked homicide for five and a half years.

Not here.

I realize that.

Well, over the next seven days, do me the favor of remembering it.
I wonder what exactly was the point of the conversation you were about to get into?
And I wonder how many times Officer Davis there has found a dead man who wasn't really dead until Davis was in the car calling it in and eating a donut.

Drop it.
Drop it.
For now.
Who said this was murder?
No one yet.
No one yet.
Then, why are we wasting our time? This guy's heart's got to be roughly the size of a canned ham. If this isn't a coronary, I don't know what is.
When we found him, he was lying there with a knife in his back, so what else could it be but homicide? Except, I finally figured out... he held the knife behind him... put the tip of it in his own back and got real close to the wall... then he shoved his body backwards...
Please be quiet for a while, would you?
There's a bucket here.
What?
What?
There's a bucket. Under the table.
It's a bucket of vomit.
Is there any blood in it?
Is there any blood in it?
I don't know. Feel free to look for yourself, okay?
You think it was poison?
Guessing at this point is useless.
You've seen my files, right? Seen the things I've done?
No.
No.
Anyway... I did my time on door-to-doors, and walking a beat. I did all that shit for a long time.

Yeah, well, all I want is... Just, just don't be jerking me off. That's all I ask. Don't jerk me off.
Is that clear?
Okay... sure... It's just that, with my old partner, you know...
Okay... sure... It's just that, with my old partner, you know...
I just don't think we should have that sort of relationship. We'd start quarreling over insignificant things.
Same color and texture.
Have you found any plastic scrapings near the stove or sink? Near the food?
This doesn't make any sense.
You always have to find one singular thing to focus on. There's always one thing, and it may be as small as a speck of dust, but you find it and focus... till it's an exhausted possibility.
It could be nothing.
But, why would there be so many pieces in his stomach if it were nothing? It must have been intentional.
He ate his fill, and was forced to continue eating... till his body rejected the food. the killer held a bucket under him, and then kept serving. He took his time. The coroner says this might have gone on for more than twelve hours. The victim's throat was swollen from the effort, and there was probably a point where he passed out. That's when
This was one sadistic motherfucker.
This is his stuff. I've been out in the cold all day.
This is a premeditated puzzle, and it's only the beginning.
I'm declining this case. I want us reassigned.
Whoa, whoa... what?!
It's too soon for him.
Can we talk about this in private?
It's a package deal. You get the phone with the office.
Detective Mills here. Honey... I asked you not to call me here. I'll call you back... What? Why?
It's my wife.
What?
Well?
I'm invited to have a late supper at your house. And, I accept.

What about sports?

You go to movies at least?
I read. Remember reading?

I just have to say, I can't respect any man who's never seen "Green Acres."
You've never seen "The Odd Couple?" This is sick. "The Honeymooners?!"
I vaguely recall a large, angry man, and someone called Norton.
Our guy got into office, probably before the building closed and security tightened up. Gould must have been working late.
I'm certain. He was the biggest defense lawyer around. Infamous, actually.
I'm certain. He was the biggest defense lawyer around. Infamous, actually.
Well, his body was found Monday night, okay? But, get this... the office was closed all day Monday. Which means, as long as the gluttony killing was done before the weekend, our killer could've gotten in here on Friday. He could've spent all day Saturday with Gould, and all day Sunday.
The leather chair was soaked through with sweat.
All day Saturday, and all day Sunday. The murderer would want Gould to take his time. To have to sit there and decide. Where do you make the first cut? There's a gun in your face... but, what part of your body is expendable?

He cut along the side of his stomach. The love handle.
He must have left another puzzle piece.
Look, I appreciate being able to talk this out, but, uh...
Look, I appreciate being able to talk this out, but, uh...
This is just to satisfy my curiosity. I'm still leaving town Saturday.
Gould's wife. She was away on business. If this means she saw anything, I don't know what. We've questioned her at least five times.
And, if it's a threat.
And, if it's a threat.
We put her in a safe house.

Punishing.

The sins were used in medieval sermons. There were seven cardinal virtues, and then seven deadly sins, created as a learning tool, because they distract from true worship.

For now, let's just consider the books as the murderer's inspiration. The books and sermons are about atonement for sin. And, these murders have been like forced attrition.

No fingerprints?
Nothing.
Nothing.
Totally unrelated victims.
No witnesses of any kind?
None. Which I don't understand. He had to get back out.
This is the one thing.
I know.

Even if they did, those photos were taken before forensics.
Nothing.
It's got to be.
What the fuck is that?
A switchblade.
There must be something.
We're screwed. He's fucking with us.
What?
Bear with me.
Oh, yeah, sure. You got to be kidding?!
Just wait!
Just, honestly... have you ever seen anything like this... been involved in anything like this?
No.
He just may be nuts enough.
It doesn't fit. He doesn't want us to help him stop.
It doesn't fit. He doesn't want us to help him stop.
Who the hell knows? There's plenty of freaks out there doing dirty deeds they don't want to do. You know... little voices tell them bad things.
You meant what you said to Mrs. Gould, didn't you? About catching this guy. You really want to believe that, don't you?
And you don't?
And you don't?
I wish I still thought like you.

We put it in a nice neat pile and file it away, on the slim chance it's ever needed in a courtroom. It's like collecting diamonds on a desert island. You keep them just in case you ever get rescued, but it's a pretty big ocean out there.

Never in my twenty-four years, knock on wood. I've only ever taken my gun out five times with the actual intention of using it. Never fired it though. Not once. You?
Never took a bullet. I pulled my gun once. fired it once.

It was my first one of these. We were a secondary unit, and I was pretty shaky going in. I was still considered a rookie.
How did the fire fight end?
I got him. I got the son-of-a-bitch. See, I was doing really good up till then. Lots of street busts. I've always had this weird luck... everything always went my way, but this was wild. I got him with one shot... right between the eyes. Next thing I know, the mayor's pinning a medal on me. Picture in the paper, whole nine yards.
How was it?
I expected it to be bad, you know. I took a human life... but I slept like a baby that night. I never gave it a second thought.

I think Hemingway wrote somewhere... I can't remember where, but he wrote that in order to live in a place like this, you have to have the ability to kill. I think he meant you truly must be able to do it, not just faking it, too survive.

Sounds like he knew what he was talking about.
It is Victor.
Call an ambulance.
The way this has gone till now, I wouldn't have thought it was possible, but we may have underestimated this guy.
I want him bad. I don't just want to catch him anymore. I want to hurt him.

Just, realize... this is not some common lunatic. The type of intestinal fortitude it must take... to keep a man bound for a full year. To connect tubes to his genitals. To sever his hand and use it to plant fingerprints. He's methodical and exacting, and worst of all, he's patient.

I don't know... like fifty.
Well, that was money well spent.

No dates indicated, placed on the shelves in no discernible order. It's just his mind poured out on paper. I don't think it's going to give us any specifics.
Looking around... I've got a bad feeling these murders are his life's work.
He's preaching.
These murders are his masterwork. His sermon to all of us. To all us sinners.
The irony is, after a day of the type of work he did, he'd come home and read me these morbid crime stories. Murders in the Rue Morgue. Le Fanu's Green Tea. My mother would give him hell because he was keeping me up till all hours.

You think you're doing me a big favor by staying?
You think you're doing me a big favor by staying?
I'm requesting you keep me on as your partner a few more days. You'd be doing me the favor.
You knew I'd say yes.
No, actually, I wasn't sure at all.
As soon as this is over, I'm gone.
Big surprise.
Because he is John Doe, by choice.
When do we get to question him?
You know he's fucking us.
You and I are, probably for the first time ever, in total agreement. He wouldn't just stop.
You and I are, probably for the first time ever, in total agreement. He wouldn't just stop.
Well... what the fuck, man?
Well... what the fuck, man?
He's only two murders away from finishing his masterpiece, right? Can you even conceive of what's going to happen next? I mean, can you even imagine how he'll try to finish it?
No.
I can tell you this. I recognize his lawyer. His name's Mark Swarr.
If John Doe's head splits open and a U.F.O. flies out, I want you to have expected it.
I will.
What is it?
Well, I have to tell you... I think I've fallen in love with you.
Well, I have to tell you... I think I've fallen in love with you.
Slut.
Slut.
Kiss me on the lips.
Kiss me on the lips.
Give me a break.
Stay with him.
Wait!
Wait!
There's no time to discuss it!
Throw your gun down now!
What are you talking about? What happened?
Throw your weapon, detective! Now!
What did you say?
Tell me it's not true.
I can't let you do this...
Put your gun down!!
Don't do this... please...
Don't do this... please...
Put the gun down, Somerset!
I'm sorry about this, Mrs. Gould. I really am.
I... I don't understand.
I need you to look at each one carefully... very carefully. Look for anything that seems strange or out of place. Anything at all.
I don't know why... why now?
I don't know why... why now?
Please, I need you to help me if we're going to get who did this.
Anything... anything missing or different.
I don't see anything.
I don't see anything.
Are you absolutely certain?
Are you absolutely certain?
I can't do this now... please.
This painting...
What?
What?
Why is this painting hanging upside-down?
It's nice to meet you. My husband has told me a lot about you... except your first name.
Oh... um, William.
Oh... um, William.
It's a nice name. William, I'd like you to meet David. David... William.
It smells good.
What? Oh, yes. I mean, thank you. Please, sit down.
I hear you and Mills were high school sweethearts.
High school and college, yes. Pretty hokey, huh? I knew on our first date this was the man I was going to marry. God... he was the funniest man I'd ever met.
High school and college, yes. Pretty hokey, huh? I knew on our first date this was the man I was going to marry. God... he was the funniest man I'd ever met.
Really?
Don't worry. I don't wear it at the dinner table.
No matter how often I see guns, I still can't get used to them.
You have a strange way about you... I mean interesting. I'm sorry. It's really none of my business. It's just nice to meet a man who talks like that. If David saw that paper, he'd say you're a fag. That's how he is.
I guess I won't be showing it to him then.
I was close once. It just didn't happen.
It surprises me. It really does.
It surprises me. It really does.
Any person who spends a significant amount of time with me finds me... disagreeable. Just ask your husband.
How long have you lived here?
Too long. What do you think so far?
I don't know, with this case.
If you can, please call me. Please. I have to go now... goodnight.
I mean, you known this city. You've been here for so long.
It's a hard place.
It's a hard place.
I don't sleep very well.
I feel strange being here with you... without David knowing.
I'm sorry, I only...
Perfect example.
You have to put blinders on sometimes. Most times.

I don't know why I asked you to come.

Talk to him about it. He'll understand if you tell him how you feel.
Talk to him about it. He'll understand if you tell him how you feel.
I can't be a burden, especially now. I know I'll get used to things. I guess I wanted to know what someone who's lived here thinks. Upstate, it was a completely different environment. I don't know if David told you, but I teach fifth grade, or did.

He mentioned it.
I've been going to some of the schools, looking for work, but the conditions here are... horrible.
You should look into private schools.
You should look into private schools.
I don't know...
Oh, Tracy... I have to tell you, I'm not the one to talk to about this.
I hate this city.
Well, I got up one morning and went to work... just like any other day, except it was my first since hearing about the baby. And, I... I felt this fear and anxiety washing over me. I looked around, and I thought, how can we raise a child surrounded by all this? How can a child grow up here? So, that night, I told
I want to have children. It's just...
I want to have children. It's just...
I can tell you now, I know... I'm positive I made the right decision. I'm positive. But, there's never a day that passes that I don't wish I had decided differently.
Neighbors heard them screaming at each other for like two hours. It was nothing new. But, then they heard the gun go off. Both barrels.
Did the wife confess?
Did the wife confess?
When the patrolman came she was trying put his head back together. She was crying too hard to say anything.
Why always like this? Only after the fact... this sudden realization, that if you shoot someone, or stick a knife in them, that person will cease to exist.
Crime of passion.
Crime of passion.
Yes. Look at all the passion splattered up on the wall here.
Yes. Look at all the passion splattered up on the wall here.
This is a done deal. All but the paperwork.
Did their son see it happen?
I don't know.
How's California?
How should I know?
How should I know?
But Mose Harper said...
But Mose Harper said...
That old goat still creakin' around?...Whyn't someone bury him?
It was Ethan found you squallin' in a sage clump after your folks was massacred...
It just happened to be me...No need to make any more of it...
Passed the Todd place comin' in... What happened to 'em?
They gave up...went back to the cotton rows...So'd the Jamisons... Without Martha, I don't know...She wouldn't let a man quit.
You askin' me to clear out now?
You're my brother...You're welcome to stay as long as you got a mind to...Ain't that so, Martha?
Now, Ethan, I ain't sure...
Don't argue!...And stay close... Maybe they're rustlers...and maybe this dodderin' old idiot ain't so far wrong...
Lucy's going on seventeen now...
An' she's got a beau! Kisses him, too!
An' she's got a beau! Kisses him, too!
That's enough...Go on inside and help Lucy set the table...You, too, Deborah!
Not tonight...Ben, put that sword back.
It's not a sword, ma...It's a sabre! Did you kill many damYankees with this sabre, Uncle Ethan?
It's all right, ma...I been watchin'... Only I wish...
What, Ben?
What, Ben?
I wish Uncle Ethan was here. Don't you, ma?
Killed every one -- an' not for food either...Why'd they do a thing like that?
Stealing the cattle was just to pull us out...This here's a murder raid... It shapes up to scald out either your place...or my brother's.
Let's get along...
Why don't you finish the job?
They got to stop <U>sometime</U>...if they're human at all, they got to stop!
Naw...a human man rides a horse till it dies...then he goes on afoot...A Comanche comes along...gets that horse up...and rides it twenty more miles...Then he eats it.
You've said that enough!...Maybe Lucy's dead...maybe they're both dead...but if I hear it from you again, I'll fight ya, Mr. Edwards!
That'll be the day!...Let's ride.
Why'd they break off? Was there water in that canyon?
Huh...? No...no water.
What you saw wasn't Lucy.
It was, I tell you!
It was, I tell you!
What you saw was a buck wearin' Lucy's dress... I found Lucy back there in that canyon...I wrapped her in my blanket an' buried her with m'own hands...I thought it best to keep it from you -- long as I could.
<U>Charlie</U> <U>MacCorry</U>!...You weren't fixin' to marry HIM??
She sure is!...An' don't think your comin' back is goin' to change it!
She sure is!...An' don't think your comin' back is goin' to change it!
As to that, I don't know, Charlie... We hadn't got around to talkin' marriage...

AND other things...Mebbe you thought you was gettin' away with being comical about that Indian wife you took...I bet she wasn't the first squaw you...
It's all right...Charlie, let's move outside.
I ain't wearing no gun.
Another one, eh?
This 'un come a long way 'fore he died.
This 'un come a long way 'fore he died.
Well, that's seven we can score up to your brother, Ethan.
Is this in the line of duty, sergeant?
No sir...pleasure.
No sir...pleasure.
In that case, give the boys room...
You all right, sergeant?
Dunno...Seems so.
Dunno...Seems so.
Well, go get cleaned up and we'll proceed with the weddin'...
You're goin' if the captain says you're goin'...
Now, now...let's not grow dis- putatious...
Ethan, you an' Martin are hereby appointed civilian scouts -- without pay...Charlie, hightail it to head- quarters an' spread the word...
Yes sir...
Haven't seen you since the surrender. Come to think of it, I didn't see you <U>at</U> the surrender.
I don't believe in surrenderin'...I still got my sabre, Reverend...never turned it into any ploughshare neither!
You ain't goin'...
He sure <U>is</U> goin'...He's sworn in.
He sure <U>is</U> goin'...He's sworn in.
Well, swear him out again!...I'll go with you.
You can forget that... Wouldn't be legal anyway.
Why? You wanted for a crime, Ethan?
You askin' as a Reverend or a Captain, Sam?
I'm askin' as a Ranger of the sovereign state of Texas.
I'm askin' as a Ranger of the sovereign state of Texas.
Got a warrant?

You fit a lot of descriptions.
You fit a lot of descriptions.
I figger a man's only good for one oath at a time...I took mine to the Confederate States of America... So did you, Reverend...
He cometh forth like a...
Amen!...Put an 'amen' to it!
Amen!...Put an 'amen' to it!
...like a flower and is cut down... <U>Amen</U>!
What good does that do?
By what you preach...none!
They're camped by the river -- 'bout twenty miles from here. Soon's it gets dark we'll circle out so's to jump 'em before day- break.
You're right sure you want to <U>jump</U> 'em, Ethan?
It's what we're here for, ain't it?
I thought we were trying to get the girls back -- <U>alive</U>...We jump those Comanches, they'll kill 'em...You know that!
What do you know about it?...What's a quarter-breed Cherokee know about the Comanche trick of sleeping with his best pony tied right beside him...You got as much chance of stampedin' their herd as...
...as you have of findin' those girls alive by ridin' into 'em... I say we do it my way, Ethan...and that's an order!
...as you have of findin' those girls alive by ridin' into 'em... I say we do it my way, Ethan...and that's an order!
Yes, sir...But if you're wrong, <U>Captain</U> Clayton, don't ever give me another!
You got any more orders, Captain?
Just keep goin'...
If you were tryin' to surround 'em, you sure succeeded.
How far's the river from here, Mose?
I didn't give any order to fire!
That's all right, Captain...I don't need any formal invitation to kill a Comanch...
That's all right, Captain...I don't need any formal invitation to kill a Comanch...
You got one now!
Evenin'...evenin' Reverend...or do I call you 'Captain'...?
Came here for a wedding, Ethan... Until that's over, I reckon 'reverend' will do...
Fight fair, son...Use your fists!
Comanches don't use their fists, reverend...Let 'em alone...
I got to ask you and Martin to ride to the State Capitol with me, Ethan.
This an invite to a necktie party, Reverend?
This an invite to a necktie party, Reverend?
<U>Captain</U>...Nope, wouldn't say that... Likely you had your reasons for killin' Futterman...Probably needed killin'...I'm speaking as a ranger now, not as a reverend...Fact that all three was shot in the back is the only thing that's raised some question -- that and a missin' gold piece known to have been on him just prior to his demise.
We can get within 500 yards...there's a hogback to the south.
How many, would you say?
How many, would you say?
Enough to go around...I'd say about a dozen apiece...Mount 'em up!
Now son, it's a bitter thing to say, but there's more than your sister at stake here.
There sure is! I'm going to tell you somethin'...I wasn't going to speak of it...But I'll tell you now. Did you notice them scalps strung on Scar's lance? Did you see the third scalp from the point of the lance? Long... wavy hair...
I didn't <U>want</U> to tell you...but maybe it's your right to know.
Now mount up, son...
I say NO!
Go ahead, son...But at the first alarm, we're comin' in -- and we ain't goin' to have time to pick and choose our targets when we do...
What in...?
Captain Clayton...Captain!
Go on! Whyn't you have your bugler sound the charge while you're at it??
Sir?
Sir?
Never mind...Your pa know you're out here?
Never mind...Your pa know you're out here?
Yes, sir...Troop's about ten miles back...The Colonel sent me looking for you...
Yes, sir...Troop's about ten miles back...The Colonel sent me looking for you...
Well you found me...Good work, son...Good work.
If there's anything I can do, sir...
God forbid...No, son, you flog on back and tell your pa where we're at...and where he's at...
God forbid...No, son, you flog on back and tell your pa where we're at...and where he's at...
But he knows THAT, sir...Can't I stay, sir?
But he knows THAT, sir...Can't I stay, sir?
All right...But keep your eye on me, boy...I'm the hard case you're up against here -- not these childish savages...If you don't hear me first time I holler, you better read my mind...I don't aim to raise no two hollers on any subject at hand...

Yes, sir...
Is Captain Clayton here, Reverend?
I'm Clayton.
Colonel Greenhill's compliments, sir. The Colonel wishes to know how soon you could put a company of Rangers in the field, fully armed and...
Hold on, son...Who's this Colonel Greenhill you're talking about?

JOINT action?
JOINT action?
Yes sir...We've received information about a band of Comanches under a chief named Scar...
And what makes you think he's in this territory?
Yesterday, one of our patrols picked up a man claims he was a prisoner with Scar till only two days ago... He talks crazy but I brought him along...Says he lives here...keeps mentioning a rocking chair.
You tell your pa a company of Rangers -- all fourteen of 'em -- fully armed an' equipped will be in the field by daylight...headin' for the south end of the Malapai. If he can catch up with us, well an' good...
But...but captain, we can't possibly take the field tomorrow...for your own protection...
But...but captain, we can't possibly take the field tomorrow...for your own protection...
Sonny, yonder's a passel of murderers, complete with Texican scalps an' white girl captive...You want to protect us, you just get out of our way...Now <U>skedaddle</U>!

Grab hold!...

Ay-eh...That's jest what I tole Joe Powers...That un's gettin' kinda sassy, ain't he, Ethan?
Leggo my arm...You look mangier 'n ever.
Ain't been too good...No sir, not too good...Gettin' old, Ethan...
Ain't been too good...No sir, not too good...Gettin' old, Ethan...
You were born old...
Well, the reward still stands...
Don't want no money, Ethan...jus' a place -- a roof over m' head...a little grub...a bunk to sleep in... an' a rockin' chair by the fire... my own rockin' chair by a fire...
Don't want no money, Ethan...jus' a place -- a roof over m' head...a little grub...a bunk to sleep in... an' a rockin' chair by the fire... my own rockin' chair by a fire...

You said there'd be a thousand dollar reward.

Scar's band was headin' north...to winter in at Fort Wingate...eatin' agency beef. That's what this buck said...Maybe he lied.
Scar's band was headin' north...to winter in at Fort Wingate...eatin' agency beef. That's what this buck said...Maybe he lied.
And maybe you lie...
And maybe you lie...
In that case you won't find her -- and I won't get my thousand dollars.
Don't forget to come back with my thousand dollars.
Ain't yours yet.
Sir -- we charged!..Gentlemen -- and I hope you will quote me -- I cannot say too much for the courage of the men who followed me into that Cheyenne camp...
<U>Cheyenne</U>! What Cheyenne?
<U>Cheyenne</U>! What Cheyenne?
I beg your pardon?
I beg your pardon?
That camp you hit was Nawyecka Comanche...Chief Scar's bunch...
My name's Edwards...I'm looking for my niece...she was in that camp when you attacked...
Well...I know there were some captives recovered...
Are you sure they didn't die of carbine shots fired by a bunch o' Yank bluebellies so scared they couldn't tell the difference between a Cheyenne and a Comanche?
Keefer!..Put this man under arrest!
Keefer!..Put this man under arrest!
That'll be the day... 'As we developed the village'... Next time you develop a village, hit it where the fightin' men are... You won't get any headlines for killin' squaws.
Not quite...Quarter Cherokee. The rest is Welsh...So they tell me.
You've done a lot of growin'...
Somethin' mighty fishy about this trail, Uncle Ethan...
Stop callin' me 'uncle'...I ain't your uncle.
Stop callin' me 'uncle'...I ain't your uncle.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Don't have to call me 'sir' neither... Nor grampaw neither...Nor Methuselah neither...I can whup you to a frazzle.
What you want me to call you?
Name's Ethan...Now what's so mighty fishy about this trail?
Name's Ethan...Now what's so mighty fishy about this trail?
Well, fust off...
Well, come on!
Easy! It's forty miles, sonny...Horses can do with some grain and a little rest.
Nothing for you to see.
Leggo...
All right...but I'm givin' the orders...You take 'em or we split up here and now...
Why, sure, Ethan...There's just the one thing we're after...finding Deborah and Lucy...
Why, sure, Ethan...There's just the one thing we're after...finding Deborah and Lucy...
If they're still alive...
Easy on that!
Sorry...We don't even know if Debbie 'n Lucy are with this bunch...Maybe they split up...
Sorry...We don't even know if Debbie 'n Lucy are with this bunch...Maybe they split up...
They're with 'em -- if they're still alive.
You want us to fire a shot if...
No...nor build bonfires...nor beat drums neither. I'll meet you on the far side.
You all right, Ethan?
Huh...? Sure I'm all right...
Say!...What happened to your blanket? Lose it?
Must've...Anyway, I ain't goin' back to look for it...
What you goin' to do?
Get some sleep...Tomorrow's another day...
Say it. We're beat!
No...our turnin' back don't change anything...not in the long run. If she's alive, she's safe...for a while...They'll keep her to raise as one of their own, 'til she's of an age to...
And you think we got a chance to find her?
An Injun will chase a thing til he thinks he's chased it enough...Then he quits...Same when he runs...Seems he never learns there's such a thing as a critter that might just keep comin' on...So we'll find them in the end, I promise you that...We'll find them just as sure as the turning of the earth.
Good night...Laurie...
Good night...
Jorgensen's been runnin' his cattle with my own...
YOUR cattle?...<U>DEBBIE'S</U> cattle!
He's agreed to take you on and share the increase from my herd while I'm gone...I'll be pushin' on tomorrow...

All right...I ain't got no kin... I'm goin' to keep lookin' that's all.
How? You got any horses, or money to buy 'em...You ain't even got money to buy cartridges...Jorgensen's offering you a good livin' here...
Martin...I want you to know some- thin'...
Yeah...you want me to know I ain't got no kin -- no money -- no horses -- nothing but a dead man's clothes to wear!..You tole me that already... Now shut your head!
Yeah...you want me to know I ain't got no kin -- no money -- no horses -- nothing but a dead man's clothes to wear!..You tole me that already... Now shut your head!
Good night.
Hey! What's the idea...?
Maybe I'm gettin' like Mose Harper -- my bones is cold tonight...
Not so funny...if you recollect what 'Nawyecka' means...
What's that?
Sorta like 'roundabout' -- like a man says he's goin' one place when he means to go just the reverse...
Oh...
Oh...
You all settled an' comfortable now?
Futterman?
He just couldn't wait...
He just couldn't wait...
Whatchu doin'?...
Let's go...I think I stumbled onto somethin'...
Scar?
When are you goin' to learn to keep your mouth shut! Come on. Let's get out of here.
But I just bought a good blanket.
But I just bought a good blanket.
Forget it...
What I heard back there was that a band o' hostile Nawyeckas came through this way less'n two weeks ago...
Think it might be...?
<U>YOU</U> don't understand, ya chunkhead! <U>You</U> didn't buy any blanket! Ya bought <U>her</U>!
What?
What?
You got yourself a <U>wife</U>, sonny!
You got yourself a <U>wife</U>, sonny!
Oh no! Tell her she's got to go back...
Oh no! Tell her she's got to go back...
And have her whole family after our scalps for floutin' one o' their women?...No sir! Come on, Mrs. Pauley...
That's the way to train 'em. Looks like Mrs. Pauley's goin' to make you a fine beautiful wife...
Cut it out, will ya...
Says her name's Wild Goose Flying in the Night Sky...but she'll answer to Look since it pleases ya...
Look?
You ask her!
Look! Scar?... Do you know where he went? And if he has a girl with him...a <U>white</U> girl -- nai-bist pabo taibo...
Beats me how she could get that pony out o' camp without neither of us hearin' a thing...
She ain't goin' back to her family, that's certain...not if she took off where the arrow points.
She ain't goin' back to her family, that's certain...not if she took off where the arrow points.
Think she means for us to follow?
Think she means for us to follow?
How should <U>I</U> know...She's YOUR wife!
I think maybe we oughta...
Yeah, I kinda figgered you'd say that...Bein' a new husband and all...
Ethan, quit it!
Nine... Ten!
Nine... Ten!
What's the sense in it!
Least, <U>THEY</U> won't feed any Comanches this winter...Killin' buffalo's as good as killin' Injuns in this country.
Peaceful tribes depend on the buffalo, too....
Peaceful tribes depend on the buffalo, too....
Ain't that too bad...If you feel that sorry for your kinfolk, I'm surprised you didn't take up with that squaw wife of yours...
Well, you're a widower now...
What'd the soldiers have to kill her for!..
No...She's not...
I ain't sure...Where's that doll?
Lemme alone...
You breeds are all alike -- two drinks an'...
Suit yourself...While you're enjoyin' your little conversation, I'll be ridin' out with Senor Fernandez here... The Comanch' medicine country ain't far...there's one camp with a chief named Cicatriz.
Never heard of him...
Never heard of him...
Cicatriz is Mex for <U>Scar</U>...an' he has a white girl in his tepee...Be seein' you...
Stay out here.
Not likely.
You figger Scar means to kill us?
He's got to...All these years, run- nin', dodgin', knowin' we were after him...Now we caught up...It's him or us.
He's got to...All these years, run- nin', dodgin', knowin' we were after him...Now we caught up...It's him or us.
Why didn't he make his move back there?
Why didn't he make his move back there?
I don't know...Somethin' tied his hands...maybe hospitality...
How? She's even forgot her own language!
Debbie, you're comin' with us! Hear me?
Go on! Get out of here while you can...
Over there!
They'll be back...
We won't be here...Come on!
'I, Ethan Edwards, being of sound mind and without any blood kin, do hereby bequeath all my property of any kind to Martin Pauley...' I don't want your property.... 'Sides, what do you mean no 'blood kin?' Debbie's your blood kin...
Not no more.
Not no more.
You can keep your will! I ain't forgettin' you was all set to shoot her yourself...What kind o' man are you, anyway.
You can keep your will! I ain't forgettin' you was all set to shoot her yourself...What kind o' man are you, anyway.
She's been with the bucks! She's nothin' now but a...
What's that got to do with us?
What's goin' on?
Wait! We go chargin' in, they'll kill her...and you know it.
It's what I'm countin' on.
I know you are...Only it ain't goin' to be that way...she's alive...
Livin' with Comanches ain't bein' alive...
Livin' with Comanches ain't bein' alive...
She's alive...Better she's alive and livin' with Comanches than her brains bashed out...
I saw it...And don't try to tell me it was Aunt Martha's or Lucy's...
You don't remember it, but I remember. That was your mother's scalp!
Was your niece about their age?
Not far from it...
Not far from it...
Hard to realize they're white, isn't it...
Hard to realize they're white, isn't it...
They're not white any more -- they're <U>Comanche</U>!...Let's see the bodies...
Well, we only got the one lead -- Scar...And where we begin to look, I don't know...
There's one thing. We recovered a bushel of trinkets in that camp... cheap stuff...trade goods...Couldn't help noticing that most of it was Mexican...Maybe if you could talk to some of those Mexican traders along the border...What do they call themselves?

That's the breed...Course it might take time.
Time's running out...But I'm obliged to you.
I'd be obliged if you'd get to the point, ma'am.
I am...I am...It's just that I know Martha'd want you to think of her boys as well as her girls...And if the girls are...dead...Ethan, don't let the boys waste their lives in vengeance!
Well, you did all a body could, Ethan.
I got your boy killed.
I got your boy killed.
Don't go blamin' yourself...
Why it's just a snip of calico...
You ever see it before...like mebbe on a dress Debbie wore?
You ever see it before...like mebbe on a dress Debbie wore?
Yes!..Yes, I remember!..Have they found her, Ethan?

She's not a little girl any more.
You've seen her!...She's alive?

Oh, all right! Well...Martin says...

Dear Miss Laury...I take pen in hand to let you know Ethan and me still are trying to catch up with them Com- anches the late Mister Futterman told us about...
The <U>late</U> Mister Futterman?
That means Mister Futterman is dead, by golly.
Every young man should at least once...Go on, Laurie! Read!
A little Comanche squaw - SQUAW!
They never find that girl.
Yours truly... And he even has to write his full name...Martin Pauley...not even just <U>Martie</U>!... I don't care if he <U>never</U> comes back!
Don't go takin' that stuff...
Ain't worth the mendin'...
What you gettin' red-in-the-face for?...I have brothers, haven't I?
Well I ain't one of 'em!
Well I ain't one of 'em!
I'm a woman, Martie... We wash and mend your dirty clothes all our lives...When you're little we even wash <U>you</U>....How a man can ever make out to get bashful in front of a woman I'll never know...

Take it and welcome...but don't count on finding me here when you get back...I've been dallying around this god-forsaken wind-scour almost two long years waitin' for you...I ain't cut out to be an old maid!
I can't help it, Laurie...I just gotta catch up with Ethan...
I...I wrote you a letter...Reckon you didn't get it...
One letter in five years...I read it till the paper dried up and the writing faded out...

Don't cry, Laurie...I understand how it is...I'll just go 'way...
You do and I'll die, Martie...I will! I'll just die!
Martie...don't go! Not this time.

Say it anyway. Come on, how much do you love me?
"With you, my life began and with you shall it end..."
I have to cut his windpipe...
You're not a doctor, you'll hurt him!
You're not a doctor, you'll hurt him!
What else should I do, damn it, he's dying!
Ellen, move aside...
Oh God, Tommi...
Stop that!
You'll never get away from me!
So, how does it feel to be kissed by two women?
They say it's fantastic. At least that's what I read in a men's magazine. So who are the two lucky ones?
They say it's fantastic. At least that's what I read in a men's magazine. So who are the two lucky ones?
Me and the muse, of course. How is your book coming along?
Oh, the muse... we're still having our differences. You know how it is with women.
Well then, I guess I'd better leave the two of you alone. But don't forget...
What kind of a horrible thing is that?
It still worked in town.
It still worked in town.
I mean the armchair!
I mean the armchair!
Oh, that was upstairs. A real antiquity! I think it's great.
Maybe the antenna's broken.
We're probably lucky that we even have running water and electricity! Damned box!
Hey... the fuse.
Oh, damnit!
Do you know where fuse box is?
In the cellar, I think. Wait, I'll take care of it.
Look at this! We'll have to fix the whole wiring. This stuff is dangerous as hell.
We'll call for someone from town first thing in the morning.

My father was an electrician. Already forgot that?
My father was an electrician. Already forgot that?
My father was a pilot. And do I know how to fly?
Hey, flower child, the sixties are over. And this stuff is hazardous to your health.
Yes, daddy.
Where are you going?
Well, if you won't let me smoke grass, then at least I'll go get myself some cigarettes.
What are you doing?
Making our very own solstice fire.
Is everything alright? Aren't you feeling well?
I just had a really strange experience.
Maybe I should talk to Dr. Roth about it.
Hey, take your time. You know time heals better than any shrink ever can.
I have a funny feeling. Do you think we'll get over all that's happened?
We just have to make a new beginning.
We just have to make a new beginning.
Cherry-red Tears.
Cherry-red Tears.
What?
What?
Cherry-red Tears, your first book. I read it at least nine times. And then I found out you were going to attend some kind of book fair.

Not a book fair. I was signing autographs in a department store.
Not a book fair. I was signing autographs in a department store.
I was so excited about meeting you. Again and again, I kept getting in the back of the line so I could be the last to talk to you.
I was so excited about meeting you. Again and again, I kept getting in the back of the line so I could be the last to talk to you.
And two months later, we got married. And all because of one sentence: "With you, my life began and with you shall it end..."
I miss Tommi so much.
So do I, believe me.
So do I, believe me.
Do you really think anything can ever be like it was before?
Do you really think anything can ever be like it was before?
Maybe different. I don't know, Ellen.
Maybe different. I don't know, Ellen.
If we stand a chance at all, it's only by sticking together.
Who was that?
Someone from the village.
Martin, it's not funny!
You know, it's not always easy for me, either. But at least I try not to give in to each and every neurosis.
Well, apparently it was a big mistake to try talking to you. Don't you remember what we promised to each other? Honesty - trust!
Come on, this isn't about honesty. You just need a good night's sleep. The way you toss and turn all night, even I hardly get any sleep.
Now, what did I do to deserve this?
Come on, at least try one. It took me two hours to make these.
So, did you sleep good?
Yeah... I have to go to town.
Hey, you're still here. I suppose you like it here with us.
No, thanks. I have everything I need. Drive safely, you hear?
Don't tell me you've made friends with that wandering flea circus?
Why not? She can guard the house. By the way, I gave her a name: Clara.
Where have you been all day?
I went to see Prof. Roth! You know, I had another one of those dreams last night. I saw Tommi!
But that's not the point! What if all these things are somehow connected?
Oh, baloney. You should just hear yourself talk!
Where have you been?
In the village. Look what I found.
"Events commonly interpreted as haunting apparitions often result from psychic disharmonies or undigested traumatic ordeals..."
Ellen, what are you trying to prove, anyway? That we've created ourselves a ghost? Come on!
It's just a feeling. Don't you sense it, too?
What? What am I supposed to sense?
What? What am I supposed to sense?
The house - Tommi - something just doesn't jive here...
Who's that?
I haven't the slightest idea.
What?
Look at this! The dog! She's dead!
She was old.
Old?! Come look at this! She has wounds. Wounds on her head. Like thrashes. Or bites.
Old?! Come look at this! She has wounds. Wounds on her head. Like thrashes. Or bites.
Maybe an animal.
Maybe an animal.
An animal? What kind of animal? A goddamned T-Rex, or what?
Let me guess: Another short circuit?
Hi, darling.
During the Middle Ages people were executed at every corner. What's your point?
This house, the whole damned area around here is one mass grave... Now you might call me crazy, but there is something negative about the place.
This house, the whole damned area around here is one mass grave... Now you might call me crazy, but there is something negative about the place.
Okay, so the house has a history and there might still be a couple of corpses in the moors. "There is something negative about the place..." What the hell are you trying to say? Come on! Spit it out!
Will you finally cut it out? Just in case you haven't noticed, I am trying to write a book here. And maybe - even with your birdbrains - you can figure it's a pretty tough job. So why can't you just leave me alone?
Damn it, look at you! Don't you see what's happening with you? We need to get out of here, don't you understand? Out of this house!
Martin, what-
It's simply too dangerous here! But no, you always have to have it your way.
You know what I have to do now, and believe me: I don't enjoy doing this.
Martin, damnit, what are you up to? Let go of me!
Of course you'll give me the blame again. Like back then. Just a tiny cut and he could still be alive today - isn't that right, Ellen?
What are you talking about-
Oh, Ellen. My sweet Ellen... Of course I knew.
We loved each other once. Have you forgotten that?
I told you, there is no way out. He won't let you go.
'HE'? Whom do you mean-
It's important - he knows the last chapter.
Your book - that's why you were always in the cellar!
You know, Tommi wants me to become the man I used to be.
...So he's dictating you a new bestseller? Whatever that is, it's not our son.
What?
I have a yearning for... smog, cars and many, many people... A real dirty... big city. What do you think?
How did you get me out of there?
I wouldn't have made it by myself.
For God's sake, what happened to me?
You don't remember?
Ellen.
You're doing fine, aren't you? I mean... the two of you alone in that house, so far out in the moor.
Oh, Ellen! I've been wondering when you'd come. Why don't you step in.
Thank you.
I really hate to bother him, but...
Oh no, no. You're not bothering him. He has lots of time since he's been retired.
Frank Kosinski. Here's the address. Go see him. Ask him.
Thank you. Elisabeth, I didn't mean to...
That's alright. Don't misunderstand my husband. It's only that he's already had enough problems with this case. And who would believe him if he told the truth?
But what is the truth?
But what is the truth?
I don't know all about what happened back then. But it always stood between me and my husband.
Hello. Can I help you?
Does this dog here belong to you?
No, I've never seen him before.
You know, I saw him sitting outside your gate... Oh, I'm sorry, I'm forgetting my manners again! I haven't even introduced myself yet. Hi, my name's Lindner. Karl Lindner.
Ellen Straub.
It's a pleasure. You're from the city, right?
It's a pleasure. You're from the city, right?
Do I look like it that much?
Do I look like it that much?
Village gossip. You're a real attraction here.
I guess it's too lonely for most folks. It's time for me to get going. It's been a pleasure meeting you.
Wait, won't you join me for a cup of coffee?
You know, after doing that job for so many years, you learn to appreciate the simple things in life. Flowers incorporate a beauty that I always missed in life. But certainly, you're not here to chat about my hobbies.
1976. What happened back then?
Do yourself a favor: Don't ask.
I appreciate your concern, but we live in that house. I need to know what happened in there.
Listen, it's one thing to have a guilt complex. But I know the difference between when I'm overstrung and when I'm seeing things that are simply not there! Besides, it only began after we moved!
There is, of course, another possible explanation which I dearly hope is not the case.
And that is?
A tumor - which could cause pressure on certain parts of the brain and, thus, influence your perception.
Mrs. Straub!
I've killed my husband!
I've killed my husband!
What?
What?
I think I've killed him. Martin, my husband, I've killed him! That is, I'm not sure, but...
It all went so fast. He was out of his mind and then all of sudden there was this screwdriver. I only wanted to defend myself. You have to call the police...
We can do all of that later, but first you need to calm down.
Oh, Mrs. Straub. May I introduce you to my wife?
Just call me Elisabeth.
Stop scaring people. Let's go. We need to be on our way.
Excuse us. But do stop by for a visit sometime! You are welcome anytime.
You didn't tell her!
We should leave the past alone.
We should leave the past alone.
Well, it will never leave us alone as long as you ignore it.
I think it's starting again. You know... there was something peculiar. If only I knew...
Peculiar? You mean, like back then?
Peculiar? You mean, like back then?
Yes, something was...
Hammer?
How could I fail to notice that! - I have to go...
Well, look here!
Ladies and gentlemen: The "Straub country-residence".
Damn, this thing is heavy. Where do you want to have it?
Tenth floor.
Tenth floor.
Very funny.
Look at this. The lock is totally demolished.
I guess someone lost their key. You did get your tetanus shots, I hope?
Twenty-three, to be exact.
I wonder how you guys figure on renovating this whole place. You can afford to spend some money. If I was you, I'd spare myself all the hard work. Besides, didn't you want to start writing again?
Hey, my man! How's the masterpiece coming along?
Not so bad, if I could get some peace and quiet around here.
