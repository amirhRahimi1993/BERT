Hey, big guy, you getting tired, yet? I am. This is Vivian. You two been together long? You and Edward?
No.
No.
Hope to be?
It's... it's not like that.
I see. Well. Maybe that means you'd have lunch with me sometime then.
You don't know anything about me.
I'd like to find out. You don't know anything about me either. That's why people have lunch.
What's that long building over there?
Storage, I think.
Storage, I think.
Not with those smokestacks it's not.
The real estate possibilities are endless. Most of the yard we'll just level. I talked to a couple of developers, under the table, of course, and they said --
You what?
You what?
I talked to some developers about the land.
Congratulations, sir.
What?
What?
Mr. Kross is just getting off the phone with his stock broker. It's finished. You've won.
Who are you going after next, sir?
Who indeed...
What would it take to buy our stock back? Name your price.
To get me in a mood to sell -- double what I paid. But your company doesn't have enough capital right now to buy anything.
Mr. Kross, I'm not here to sell you my stock. On the contrary, I'm here to buy yours.
You've got a lot of nerve.
You've got a lot of nerve.
No. What I have is a lot of money.
No. What I have is a lot of money.
I know all about you, Mr. Harris. When you buy companies, they have a way of disappearing. Even the pension funds are stripped clean. The last three companies you took over were cut up in so many pieces, widows were left without their retirement checks.

What I did with those companies was perfectly legal.

I don't question the legality of what you do. It's your morality that makes me sick. I will not allow my company to be raped by a man like you.
I don't question the legality of what you do. It's your morality that makes me sick. I will not allow my company to be raped by a man like you.
It is <u>not</u> your company. It's a public company. And I <u>am</u> going to acquire it. Either I buy from the other stock holders, or I buy from you.
Mr. Harris.
How are you, Mr. Kross.
How are you, Mr. Kross.
Not bad for a man who hasn't slept in four nights. I'll get used to it.
Yes. I'm here to tell you that I've reconsidered my position on your acquisition offer.
<u>Expected</u>... offer.
<u>Expected</u>... offer.
Of course, yes. After the <u>expected</u> filing period is over, I'm going to recommend to the board that we accept your bid.
Of course, yes. After the <u>expected</u> filing period is over, I'm going to recommend to the board that we accept your bid.
You're making the right decision, sir.
Stop. For just a moment. Mr. Kross, I'd like to ask you a few questions <u>before</u> you sign. You realize that you're a target. If you weren't mine, you'd be someone elses, correct?
Yes.
Yes.
If you had a... reprieve, what would do?
I... I would take advantage of it.
How?
I... I don't know. There... there wasn't time...
I suppose you'd find out soon enough that you have assets you presently don't seem aware of, wouldn't you? The waste processing licenses at that abandoned shipyard of yours, you'd certainly find out about that.
Quiet. Would I get the loans?
This time I imagine you would, yes. Hmm... With all this in mind, Mr. Kross, I can't logically make a formal bid on your company, can I?
This time I imagine you would, yes. Hmm... With all this in mind, Mr. Kross, I can't logically make a formal bid on your company, can I?
You'd be initiating a financial battle you'd ultimately lose, Mr. Harris.
You'd be initiating a financial battle you'd ultimately lose, Mr. Harris.
You're very right. I think the best thing we could all do is go home.

Tell me about it. L.A. is suffering from a wacko epidemic. And who knows where half the guys I pick up have been. I mean, I use condoms. Always. And I get checked out once a month at the free clinic. Not only am I better in the sack than an amateur, I'm probably safer.

Upset. No. I never get upset about business.

You liked the guy, though.

We're the exactly the same! Kit keeps telling me don't get emotional when you turn tricks -- that's why no kissing -- it's too personal. The key is like you're saying, stay numb, don't get involved -- when I'm with a guy, I'm a robot, I just do it. Except with you. At your price I give my all...
Know what we're gonna do in a little while then? We're gonna call Domino's and have'm deliver a bigass pizza. We're gonna eat it in bed. We're gonna veg' out and watch television.

Okay.

Dinner can wait.
You always been rich?
No.
No.
Seems like it. I guess it's easy to get used to, huh?
Seems like it. I guess it's easy to get used to, huh?
Easier than learning how to be poor. My father's family was wealthy. When I was young there were cars and houses, private schools, nannies. But then my father divorced my mother to marry another woman. And he took his money with him.
Keep talkin'. I like hearin'.
Not much to tell. I went to public school. Went to university on scholarship. Went to work for an investment firm. In eight years I owned it. My father was chairman of the board of the third company I ever went after. I swallowed that company and shit out the pieces. One of the pieces was him.
You still mad at'm?
He died a long time ago.
You're really pushing it, bringing me here.
I think it's exciting.

Stuckey! He wants an "appointment" with me after you leave. You my pimp now or did he think that up on his own?
What was I supposed to do? I told the truth. Why should the truth upset you? It's not as if you're from a convent.

Fuck off.
Fuck off.
I'll call you a cab. If you want the clothes, pack them up.
Vivian... I'm sorry. I wasn't prepared for questions about us. It was an idiotic and insensitive thing I did. I should have known that it would hurt you.
I'm not hurt. It doesn't hurt you when somebody pisses on you, it just pissed you off.
I'm not hurt. It doesn't hurt you when somebody pisses on you, it just pissed you off.
I really am sorry.
Do I look okay?
Hmm... let's see... no, there's something missing.
What's that?
I don't want you to get too excited... these are on loan... however...
Edward, I can't.
Shush. Of course you can.
Shush. Of course you can.

I've never been on a plane before.
I'm glad you like it. Now be quiet, I've really got to read these.
Sorry. You're not paying me to ask you question like that.
Vivian. I'm paying you to be you. Be you. Have you? Ever been in love with anyone?
Vivian. I'm paying you to be you. Be you. Have you? Ever been in love with anyone?
You mean, besides Elvis? I'm a human being. Sure. Once. First time I ever ran away from home, I got as far as Atlanta. I met this boy. He'd been with his parents on their way to Chicago. They stopped at a gas station. He went to the john. When he came back they'd split. We sorta started looking out for each other. Aw,

If it's in Italian, how will I know what they're saying?

If you'd gone on about how much you liked it, I'm not sure I'd have believed you.
I more than liked it.
I more than liked it.
I know. I'm glad.
I know. I'm glad.
Did you?

Yes. I've never enjoyed it more. Thank you.
One more night and you're finally rid of me.
Yeah, you've been pretty tough to take.
Yeah, you've been pretty tough to take.
I have to go to New York tomorrow.
What else? You gonna leave some cash by the bed when you pass through town?
It wouldn't be like that. I want to get you off the street. You'll have a different kind of life. What's wrong with that?
It wouldn't be like that. I want to get you off the street. You'll have a different kind of life. What's wrong with that?
I'm sorry. That's very sweet, Edward, and I know you mean it...
Vivian, I've thought about this a lot. This is the best solution.
When I was a little girl, my mother locked me in the attic when I was bad, which was pretty often. I'd stare out the window up there and make believe I was a princess trapped in the tower by the wicked queen. Then suddenly a knight on a white horse with his bright colors flying would ride up. Rescue me from the tower,
Vivian, life's not a fairy tale.
I know. Hey, don't mind me. I'm being stupid. I'll think about it, okay? It's a real good offer for a whore.

Why do guys always know how to hit a woman? Right across the cheek, wham, so it feels like your eye is gonna explode. What do they do, take you all aside in high school and show you how? It pisses me off!

Stay with me tonight. Not because you're being paid to. Stay with me because you want to.
I do. I do want to. That's why I'm leaving. That's what you given me, see? I know what I want now. I want a guy like you for real. Not because you buy me things and give me money. The nicest thing you ever done for me is hold my hand. You gonna give me that?
I didn't think so.
Vivian...
Vivian...
It's not your fault. You're right. Kit's right. But I want the fairy tale.

Thank you.
Good afternoon, Mr. Harris.

I'll bring it back.
Edward, did you hear me?
I'm here.
I'm here.
I know a lot of nice girls.
What!?
We don't have the time to bring someone new up to speed. Besides... You've already impressed everyone you need to, haven't you?
What time's diner tonight?
Eight o'clock. Kross is bringing his son. Very bright kid, watch yourself with him. Who's this girl you're taking?

Someone's loaning it to him. Get on it right away.
Someone's loaning it to him. Get on it right away.
Our contract guys are working on the Kross pension funds. There's another forty million there. We can bleed'm dry.
Put the pension funds on hold until I say otherwise.
We're letting them slide?

But, Edward...
But, Edward...
Do it.
Excuse me for saying this but what is wrong with you this week? First, you go soft on the pension funds. Now, you're giving him the chance to get away? As of two minutes ago, you are committed to the tune of over fifty million dollars --
Come on, Bill, don't talk to me about how much money's involved. It's my money.
Come on, Bill, don't talk to me about how much money's involved. It's my money.
And some of it's mine. Edward, his jugular's exposed.

Fill me in on this. How'd you and Vivian meet?

Sales, really? That's great. What does she sell?
Why do you want to know?
Hear me out. I've known you a long time. I see a difference in you this week. Like that tie. I'm suddenly wondering if this girl's not the difference. Especially when I see her talking with David Kross.
She met him at dinner last night... I like this tie.
So now they're best friends? Edward, this girl appears out of nowhere and now I see her talking to a guy whose company we're trying to buy. It's too convenient.

You're being ridiculous.

Industrial espionage is not ridiculous. Edward, how do you know she hasn't attached herself to you so she can bring Kross back information?

Christ, Bill, she's not a spy, she's a hooker. I picked her up off Hollywood Boulevard.
This is no time to disappear. We're in too far.
Bill? Stop panicking. Kross isn't going anywhere and I don't need to spend the rest of the day watching his stock go down. I'll be in the office tomorrow.

We'll be there. Listen, if he's really caving in, we'll go from there down to the office. I want him to commit his stock to us this morning.
I don't think there's any sense in --
Let him answer.
Oh, my god... Edward, no!
I suppose you'd use them as collateral on new loans, wouldn't you?

Hi, Viv. Carlos, you know my roommate, Viv.

We worked for that money. We were gonna put together enough to get out of that dump we live in, get off this street.

Certain ladies make that very easy... Vivian. John, call a limousine for our guest, please. Have it take her anywhere she wishes to go. Bill the hotel. See you again sometime soon.
May I help you?

Are you looking for something in particular?

I was in here yesterday.
Having a good time, Vivian?
Yeah. Thanks.
Yeah. Thanks.
All this must be quite a change from Hollywood Boulevard.
What?
It's okay. Edward told me. Your secret's safe with me.
Yeah. Sure. Why not. Call me at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.
I just might do that.
Do you want to know what he did? Do you want to know what the crazy son of a bitch did? He handed the whole thing back to Kross! On a silver platter. For no reason! What was he thinking, I mean, what was going through his goddam head? Why? What was all that benevolent crap? What are we going to become, a philanthropic
I think it's great.
I bet. A lousy whore and you're the gum in a hundred million dollar deal.
Aw, come on, Bill. It's just business.
Get out!
Don't worry. I'll pay for it. What a you charge? Huh? Twenty, thirty, fifty bucks, <u>maybe</u>? Are you a fifty dollar whore?
Don't even think -- -- don't even think about trying to escape. The chains are far too thick. And don't dream of being rescued either. The only way in is secret. And only the Prince, the Count, and I know how to get in and out.
Then I'm here till I die?

Till they kill you. Yeah.

My Westley will always come for me.
I suggest a deal. You write four copies of a letter. I'll send my four fastest ships. One in each direction. The Dread Pirate Roberts is always close to Florin this time of year. We'll run up the white flag and deliver your message. If Westley wants you, bless you both. If not ... please consider me as an alternative to suicide. Are we
He will come for me.
Of course.
Ah! My dulcet darling. Tonight we marry. Tomorrow morning, your men will escort us to Florin Channel where every ship in my armada waits to accompany us on our honeymoon.
Every ship but your four fastest, you mean.
Every ship but the four you sent.
Yes. Yes, of course. Naturally, not those four.
You never sent the ships. Don't bother lying. It doesn't matter. Westley will come for me anyway.

Why not? You can't hurt me. Westley and I are joined by the bonds of love. And you cannot track that. Not with a thousand bloodhounds. And you cannot break it. Not with a thousand swords. And when I say you are a coward, that is only because you are the slimiest weakling ever to crawl the earth.
You don't seem excited, my little muffin.
Should I be?
Should I be?
Brides often are, I'm told.

Hardly complimentary, Your Highness. Why loose your venom on me?
On the high seas, your ship attacked, and the Dread Pirate Roberts never takes prisoners.
I can't afford to make exceptions. Once word leaks out that a pirate has gone soft, people begin to disobey you, and then it's nothing but work, work, work, all the time.

Does it bother you to hear?
Nothing you can say will upset me.
Nothing you can say will upset me.
He died well, that should please you. No bribe attempts or blubbering. He simply said, "Please. Please, I need to live." It was the "please" that caught my memory. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 53.
I asked him what was so important for him. "True love," he replied. And then he spoke of a girl of surpassing beauty and faithfulness. I can only assume he meant you. You should bless me for destroying him before he found out what you really are.
And what am I?
And what am I?
Faithfulness he talked of, madam. Your enduring faithfulness. Now, tell me truly. When you found out he was gone, did you get engaged to your prince that same hour, or did you wait a whole week out of respect for the dead?

... as ... you ... wish...
Oh, my sweet Westley; what have I done?
Farm boy. Polish my horse's saddle. I want to see my face shining in it by morning.
As you wish.
Farm Boy. Fill these with water -- --please.
As you wish.
I fear I'll never see you again.
Of course you will.

This will all soon be but a happy memory because Roberts' ship "Revenge" is anchored at the far end. And I, as you know, am Roberts.
But how is that possible, since he's been marauding twenty years and you only left me five years ago?

Finally, Roberts decided something. He said, "All right, Westley, I've never had a valet. You can try it for tonight. I'll most likely kill you in the morning." Three years he said that. "Good night, Westley. Good work. Sleep well. I'll most likely kill you in the morning." It was a fine time for me. I was learning to fence, to fight, anything anyone
What? -- go on --
We'll never succeed -- we may as well die here.
No. No. We have already succeeded.
I mean, what are the three terrors of the Fire Swamp? One, the flame spurts. No problem. There's a popping sound preceding each, we can avoid that. Two, the Lightning Sand. But you were clever enough to discover what that looks like, so in the future we can avoid that too.
Westley, what about the R.O.U.S.'s?
Westley, what about the R.O.U.S.'s?
Rodents of Unusual Size? I don't think they exist...
We did it.
Now, was that so terrible? --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 64.
Oh, Westley, darling. Westley, why won't you hold me?
Gently.
Gently.
At a time like this that's all you can think to say? "Gently?"
At a time like this that's all you can think to say? "Gently?"
Gently!!
Oh, Westley, will you ever forgive me?
What hideous sin have you committed lately?

I got married. I didn't want to. It all happened so fast.
I got married. I didn't want to. It all happened so fast.
It never happened.
It never happened.
What?
What?
It never happened. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 117.
But it did. I was there. This old man said, "Man and wife."
Did you say, "I do"?
Did you say, "I do"?
Well, no, we sort of skipped that part.
Well, no, we sort of skipped that part.
Then you're not married -- if you didn't say it, you didn't do it -- wouldn't you agree, Your Highness?
I did that on purpose. I don't have to miss.
I believe you -- So what happens now?
I believe you -- So what happens now?
We face each other as God intended. Sportsmanlike. No tricks, no weapons, skill against skill alone.
We face each other as God intended. Sportsmanlike. No tricks, no weapons, skill against skill alone.
You mean, you'll put down your rock and I'll put down my sword, and we'll try to kill each other like civilized people?
You mean, you'll put down your rock and I'll put down my sword, and we'll try to kill each other like civilized people?
I could kill you now.
Frankly, I think the odds are slightly in your favor at hand fighting.
It's not my fault being the biggest and the strongest. I don't even exercise. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 38.
Look are you just fiddling around with me or what?
I just want you to feel you're doing well. I hate for people to die embarrassed.
You're quick.
And a good thing too.
And a good thing too.
Why do you wear a mask? Were you burned by acid, or something like that? --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 39.
Why is that, do you think?
Well, I haven't fought just one person for so long. I've been specializing in groups. Battling gangs for local charities, that kind of thing.
Why should that make such a difference?
Well ... ... you see, you use different moves when you're fighting half a dozen people than when you only have to be worried about one.
It's fabric from the uniform of an Army officer of Guilder.
Who's Guilder?
Who's Guilder?
The country across the sea. The sworn enemy of Florin. Go!
Once the horse reaches the castle, the fabric will make the Prince suspect the Guilderians have abducted his love. When he finds her body dead on the Guilder frontier, his suspicions will be totally confirmed.
You never said anything about killing anyone.
I've hired you to help me start a war. That's a prestigious line of work with a long and glorious tradition.
I just don't think it's right, killing an innocent girl.
I just don't think it's right, killing an innocent girl.
Am I going mad or did the word "think" escape your lips? You were not hired for your brains, you hippopotamic land mass.
No more rhymes now, I mean it.
Anybody want a peanut?
I only dog paddle.
Veer left. Left. Left!
Faster!
I thought I was going faster.
I thought I was going faster.
You were supposed to be this colossus. You were this great, legendary thing. And yet he gains.

-- I do not accept excuses. I'm just going to have to find myself a new giant, that's all.
-- I do not accept excuses. I'm just going to have to find myself a new giant, that's all.
Don't say that, Vizzini. Please.
You be careful. -- people in masks cannot be trusted.
I'm waiting!
Give her to me. Catch up with us quickly.
What do I do?
What do I do?
Finish him, finish him. Your way.
Finish him, finish him. Your way.
Oh, good, my way. Thank you, Vizzini. Which way is my way?
Probably he means no harm.
He's really very short on charm.
He's really very short on charm.
Oh, you've a great gift for rhyme.
Oh, you've a great gift for rhyme.
Yes, some of the time.
FEZZIK, are there rocks ahead?
If there are, we'll all be dead.
Hello.
It's you.
It's you.
True!
You don't look so good. You don't smell so good either.
Perhaps not. I feel fine.
Perhaps not. I feel fine.
Yeah?
He's with the Prince in the Castle. But the castle gate is guarded by thirty men.
How many could you handle?
How many could you handle?
I don't think more than ten.
I don't think more than ten.
That leaves twenty for me. At my best, I could never defeat that many. I need Vizzini to plan. I have no gift for strategy. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 82.
No -- not Vizzini -- I need the Man in Black --
-- what? --
-- what? --
-- look, he bested you with strength, your greatness. He bested me with steel. He must have outthought Vizzini, and a man who can do that can plan my castle's onslaught any day. Let's go --
-- look, he bested you with strength, your greatness. He bested me with steel. He must have outthought Vizzini, and a man who can do that can plan my castle's onslaught any day. Let's go --

To find the Man in Black, obviously.
To find the Man in Black, obviously.
But you don't know where he is.
But you don't know where he is.
Don't bother me with trifles; after twenty years, at last, my father's soul will be at peace.
The Man in Black?
His true love is marrying another tonight, so who else has cause for Ultimate Suffering? Excuse me --
-- Fezzik, please --
Everybody ... MOVE!!
Well, we Montoyas have never taken defeat easily. Come along, Fezzik. Bring the body.
The body?
The body?
Have you any money?
Have you any money?
I have a little.
I have a little.
I just hope it's enough to buy a miracle, that's all. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 91.
Inigo -- there's more than thirty --
What's the difference? We've got him. Help me here. We'll have to force feed him.
What's the difference? We've got him. Help me here. We'll have to force feed him.
Has it been fifteen minutes?
Has it been fifteen minutes?
We can't wait -- the wedding's in half an hour and we must strike in the hustle and the bustle beforehand.
Tilt his head back. Open his mouth.
How long do we have to wait before we know if the miracle works?
You've been mostly dead all day.
We had Miracle Max make a pill to bring you back.
Where did we put that wheelbarrow the Albino had?
Over the Albino, I think.
Will this do?
Where did you get that?
Where did you get that?
At Miracle Max's. It fit so nice, he said I could keep it.
Don't pester him, he's had a hard day.
Right, right, sorry.
Inigo.
What?
What?
I hope we win...
He's getting away from me, Fezzik. Please. FEZZIK!
I'll be right back.
I brought you a special present.
What is it?
What is it?
Open it up.
A book?
That's right. When I was your age, television was called books. And this is a special book. It was the book my father used to read to me when I was sick, and I used to read it to your father. And today, I'm gonna read it to you.
That's right. When I was your age, television was called books. And this is a special book. It was the book my father used to read to me when I was sick, and I used to read it to your father. And today, I'm gonna read it to you.
Has it got any sports in it?
It doesn't sound too bad. I'll try and stay awake.
Oh. Well, thank you very much. It's very nice of you. Your vote of confidence is overwhelming. All right. The Princess Bride, by S. Morgenstern. Chapter One. Buttercup was raised on a small farm in the country of Florin.
Her favorite pastimes were riding her horse and tormenting the farm boy that worked there. His name was Westley, but she never called him that. Isn't that a wonderful beginning?
Yeah. It's really good.
Yeah. It's really good.
Nothing gave Buttercup as much pleasure as ordering Westley around.
-hold it, hold it-
What is this? Are you trying to trick me? -- Where's the sports? -- Is this a kissing book?
What is this? Are you trying to trick me? -- Where's the sports? -- Is this a kissing book?
-- wait, just wait --
-- wait, just wait --
-- well, when does it get good?
-- well, when does it get good?
Keep your shirt on. Let me read. Westley had no money for marriage. So he packed his few belongings and left the farm to seek his fortune across the sea.
It was a very emotional time for Buttercup --
I don't be-leeve this.
Westley didn't reach his destination. His ship was attacked by the Dread Pirate Roberts, who never left captives alive. When Buttercup got the news that Westley was murdered --
-- murdered by pirates is good --
What?
The Eel doesn't get her. I'm explaining to you because you looked nervous.
The Eel doesn't get her. I'm explaining to you because you looked nervous.
Well, I wasn't nervous.
Well, maybe I was a little bit concerned. But that's not the same thing.
Because I can stop now if you want.
Because I can stop now if you want.
No. You could read a little bit more ... if you want. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 17.
Oh no. No, please.
What is it? What's the matter? --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 56.
They're kissing again, do we have to hear the kissing part?
Someday, you may not mind so much.
Someday, you may not mind so much.
Skip on to the Fire Swamp -- that sounded good.
Skip on to the Fire Swamp -- that sounded good.
Oh. You're sick, I'll humor you. So now, where were we here? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ah. Oh. Okay. Westley and Buttercup raced along the ravine floor.
You read that wrong. She doesn't marry Humperdinck, she marries Westley. I'm just sure of it. After all that Westley did for her, if she does not marry him, it wouldn't be fair.
Well, who says life is fair? Where is that written? Life isn't always fair.
Well, who says life is fair? Where is that written? Life isn't always fair.
I'm telling you you're messing up the story, now get it right!
I'm telling you you're messing up the story, now get it right!
Do you want me to go on with this?
Do you want me to go on with this?
Yes.
Yes.
All right, then. No more interruptions. ... at noon, she met her subjects again. This time as their Queen.
It was ten days till the wedding. The King still lived, but Buttercup's nightmares were growing steadily worse.
See? Didn't I tell you she'd never marry that rotten Humperdinck?
See? Didn't I tell you she'd never marry that rotten Humperdinck?
-- yes, you're very smart. Shut-Up.
Westley's only faking, right?
You want me to read this or not?
You want me to read this or not?
Who gets Humperdinck?
Who gets Humperdinck?
I don't understand.
I don't understand.
Who kills Prince Humperdinck? At the end, somebody's got to do it. Is it Inigo? Who?
Who kills Prince Humperdinck? At the end, somebody's got to do it. Is it Inigo? Who?
Nobody. Nobody kills him. He lives. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 90.
No! I'm okay. I'm okay. -- sit down. All right?
Okay. All right, now, let's see. Where were we? Oh yes. In the Pit of Despair.
What? What?
No, it's kissing again. You don't want to hear it.
No, it's kissing again. You don't want to hear it.
I don't mind so much.
Now I think you ought to go to sleep.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. So long. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 124.
Maybe you could come over and read it again to me tomorrow.
As you wish...
Yellin.
Sire.
Sire.
As Chief Enforcer of all Florin, I trust you with this secret: killers from Guilder are infiltrating the Thieves' Forest and plan to murder my bride on our wedding night.
As Chief Enforcer of all Florin, I trust you with this secret: killers from Guilder are infiltrating the Thieves' Forest and plan to murder my bride on our wedding night.
My spy network has heard no such news.
She will not be murdered. On the day of the wedding, I want the Thieves' Forest emptied and every inhabitant arrested.
Many of the thieves will resist. My regular enforcers will be inadequate.
Many of the thieves will resist. My regular enforcers will be inadequate.
Form a Brute Squad then. I want the Thieves' Forest emptied before I wed.

It won't be easy, Sire.
It won't be easy, Sire.
Try ruling the world sometime.
Rise and report.
The Thieves' Forest is emptied. Thirty men guard the castle gate.

Double it. My Princess must be safe.
Double it. My Princess must be safe.
The gate has but one key, and I carry that.
You mean you wish to surrender to me? Very well, I accept.
I give you full marks for bravery --don't make yourself a fool.
I give you full marks for bravery --don't make yourself a fool.
Ah, but how will you capture us? We know the secrets of the Fire Swamp. We can live there quite happily for some time. So, whenever you feel like dying, feel free to visit.

I tell you once again -- surrender!
I tell you once again -- surrender!
It will not happen!
For the last time -- SURRENDER!
DEATH FIRST!!
A technicality that will shortly be remedied. But first things first. To the death.
No. To the pain.
No. To the pain.
I don't think I'm quite familiar with that phrase.
I don't think I'm quite familiar with that phrase.
I'll explain. And I'll use small words so that you'll be sure to understand, you wart-hog-faced buffoon.
I'll explain. And I'll use small words so that you'll be sure to understand, you wart-hog-faced buffoon.
That may be the first time in my life a man has dared insult me.
-- and then my tongue, I suppose. I killed you too quickly the last time, a mistake I don't mean to duplicate tonight.
I wasn't finished -- the next thing you lose will be your left eye, followed by your right --
I wasn't finished -- the next thing you lose will be your left eye, followed by your right --
-- and then my ears, I understand. Let's get on with it
-- and then my ears, I understand. Let's get on with it
Wrong! Your ears you keep, and I'll tell you why --
There was a mighty duel -- it ranged all over. They were both masters.
Who won? How did it end?
Who won? How did it end?
The loser ran off alone. The winner followed those footprints toward Guilder!
The loser ran off alone. The winner followed those footprints toward Guilder!
Shall we track them both?
Shall we track them both?
The loser is nothing. -- Only the Princess matters -- -- clearly this was all planned by warriors of Guilder. We must be ready for whatever lies ahead. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 42.
Could this be a trap?
I always think everything could be a trap -- Which is why I'm still alive.
Once we're out of sight, take him back to Florin and throw him in the Pit of Despair.
I swear it will be done.
She's been like that ever since the Fire Swamp. It's my father's failing health that's upsetting her.
Of course.
I could never cause you grief; consider our wedding off. You returned this Westley to his ship?
Yes.
Yes.
Then we will simply alert him. Beloved, are you certain he still wants you? After all, it was you who did the leaving in the Fire Swamp. Not to mention that pirates are not known to be men of their words.
Your Princess is really a winning creature. A trifle simple, perhaps, but her appeal is undeniable.
Oh, I know. The people are quite taken with her. It's odd, but when I hired Vizzini to have her murdered on our engagement day, I thought that was clever. But it's going to be so much more moving when I strangle her on our wedding night. Once Guilder is blamed, the nation will be truly outraged. They'll demand we go to war.
Now, where is that secret knot? It's impossible to find. Are you coming down into the Pit? Westley's got his strength back. I am starting him on The Machine tonight.
Tyrone, you know how much I love watching you work. But, I've got my country's five hundredth anniversary to plan, my wedding to arrange, My wife to murder, and Guilder to frame for it. I'm swamped. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 75.
Your guess is as good as mine --
I'll beat you both apart. I'll take you both together.
Who are you? -- Are we enemies? Why am I on this wall? -- Where's Buttercup? --
Let me explain -- -- No, there is too much. Let me sum up. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 99.
Buttercup is marrying Humperdinck in a little less than half an hour, so all we have to do is get in, break up the wedding, steal the Princess, make our escape after I kill Count Rugen.
That doesn't leave much time for dilly dallying.
And it is guarded by sixty men.
And our assets?
And our assets?
Your brains, Fezzik's strength, my steel.
Well, why didn't you list that among our assets in the first place? What I wouldn't give for a holocaust cloak.
There we cannot help you.
Why? You can't even lift one.
True, but that's hardly common knowledge, is it? Thank you. Now, there may be problems once we're inside.
True, but that's hardly common knowledge, is it? Thank you. Now, there may be problems once we're inside.
I'll say -- how do I find the Count? -- Once I do, how do I find you again? -- Once I find you again, how do we escape? --
Now?
Not yet.
Now?
Light him.
Where's Fezzik?
I thought he was with you.
I thought he was with you.
No.
No.
In that case --
You know, it's very strange -- I have been in the revenge business so long, now that it's over, I don't know what to do with the rest of my life.
Have you ever considered piracy? You'd make a wonderful Dread Pirate Roberts.
Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.
Stop saying that!
No --
-- offer me money --
-- yes --
-- power too -- promise me that --
-- all that I have and more please --
-- offer me everything I ask for --
-- offer me everything I ask for --
-- anything you want --
-- anything you want --
I WANT MY FATHER BACK, YOU SON- OFA-BITCH!
What? What?
Are you the Miracle Max who worked for the King all those years?
Are you the Miracle Max who worked for the King all those years?
The King's stinking son fired me. And thank you so much for bringing up such a painful subject. While you're at it, why don't you give me a nice paper cut and pour lemon juice on it? We're closed!
Look, I'm retired. And besides, why would you want someone the King's stinking son fired? I might kill whoever you wanted me to miracle.
He's already dead.
He's already dead.
He is, eh? I'll take a look. Bring him in.
Sir. Sir.
Hah?
Hah?
We're really in a terrible rush.
We're really in a terrible rush.
Don't rush me, sonny. You rush a miracle man, you get rotten miracles. You got money?
Don't rush me, sonny. You rush a miracle man, you get rotten miracles. You got money?
Sixty-five.
Sixty-five.
Sheesh! I never worked for so little, except once, and that was a very noble cause. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 93.
This is noble, sir. His wife is crippled. His children are on the brink of starvation.
Are you a rotten liar.
Are you a rotten liar.
I need him to help avenge my father, murdered these twenty years.
I need him to help avenge my father, murdered these twenty years.
Your first story was better. Where's that bellows? He probably owes you money, huh? Well, I'll ask him.
He's dead. He can't talk.
Look who knows so much. Well, it just so happens that your friend here is only mostly dead. There's a big difference between mostly dead and all dead. Please open his mouth.
Now, mostly dead is slightly alive. Now, all dead...well, with all dead, there's usually only one thing that you can do.
What's that?
True love. You heard him. You could not ask for a more noble cause than that.
Sonny, true love is the greatest thing in the world. Except for a nice MLT, a mutton, lettuce and tomato sandwich, where the mutton is nice and lean and the tomato is ripe. They're so perky, I love that. But that's not what he said. He distinctly said "to blave." And, as we all know, "to blave" means "to bluff." So you're probably playing
Humiliations galore!
That is a noble cause. Give me the sixty-five, I'm on the job.
Thank you for everything.
Okay. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 97.
Slow going?
Look, I don't mean to be rude, but this is not as easy as it looks. So I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't distract me.
Look, I don't mean to be rude, but this is not as easy as it looks. So I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't distract me.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Thank you.
I do not suppose you could speed things up?
If you're in such a hurry, you could lower a rope, or a tree branch, or find something useful to do. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 26.
I could do that. In fact, I've got some rope up here. But I do not think that you will accept my help, since I am only waiting around to kill you.
That does put a damper on our relationship.
But I promise I will not kill you until you reach the top.
That's very comforting. But I'm afraid you'll just have to wait.
That's very comforting. But I'm afraid you'll just have to wait.
I hate waiting. I could give you my word as a Spaniard.
I hate waiting. I could give you my word as a Spaniard.
No good. I've known too many Spaniards.
You don't know any way you'll trust me?
Nothing comes to mind.
We'll wait until you're ready.
Again. Thank you.
Do you always begin conversations this way?
My father was slaughtered by a sixfingered man. He was a great swordmaker, my father. And when the six-fingered man appeared and requested a special sword, my father took the job. He slaved a year before he was done.
How old were you?
I was eleven years old. When I was strong enough, I dedicated my life to the study of fencing. So the next time we meet, I will not fail. I will go up to the sixfingered man and say, "Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die."

You've done nothing but study swordplay?
You've done nothing but study swordplay?
More pursuit than study lately. You see, I cannot find him. It's been twenty years now. I am starting to lose confidence. I just work for Vizzini to pay the bills. There's not a lot of money in revenge.

Well, I certainly hope you find him, someday.

You are ready, then?

Whether I am or not, you've been more than fair. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 30.
You seem a decent fellow. I hate to kill you.
You seem a decent fellow. I hate to die.

Begin!
I thought it fitting, considering the rocky terrain --
Naturally, you must expect me to attack with Capo Ferro.
You are wonderful!
Thank you -- I've worked hard to become so.
I admit it -- you are better than I am.
Then why are you smiling?
Because I know something you don't know.
And what is that?
And what is that?
I am not left-handed.
You're amazing!
I ought to be after twenty years.
There's something I ought to tell you.
Tell me.
Tell me.
I am not left-handed either.
Who are you?!
No one of consequence.
No one of consequence.
I must know.
I must know.
Get used to disappointment.
Get used to disappointment.
Okay.
Kill me quickly.
I would as soon destroy a stained glass window as an artist like yourself. However, since I can't have you following me either --
Making sure nobody's following us.
That would be inconceivable.
Stop doing that. We can all relax, it's almost over-
You're sure nobody's following us?
You're sure nobody's following us?
As I told you, it would be absolutely, totally, and in all other ways, inconceivable. No one in Guilder knows what we've done. And no one in Florin could have gotten here so fast. Out of curiosity, why do you ask?
As I told you, it would be absolutely, totally, and in all other ways, inconceivable. No one in Guilder knows what we've done. And no one in Florin could have gotten here so fast. Out of curiosity, why do you ask?
No reason. It's only, I just happened to look behind us, and something is there.
No reason. It's only, I just happened to look behind us, and something is there.
What?
Go in, get after her!
I don't swim. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 15.
Look! He's right on top of us. I wonder if he is using the same wind we are using.
Whoever he is, he's too late -- -- see? The Cliffs of Insanity. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 19.
He's climbing the rope. And he's gaining on us.
Inconceivable!
He didn't fall? Inconceivable!!
You keep using that word -- I do not think it means what you think it means. My God! He's climbing.
I want to duel him left-handed.
You know what a hurry we're in.
You know what a hurry we're in.
Well, it's the only way I can be satisfied. If I use my right -- tch -- over too quickly.
Well, it's the only way I can be satisfied. If I use my right -- tch -- over too quickly.
Oh, have it your way.
Let me explain-
-- there's nothing to explain. You're trying to kidnap what I've rightfully stolen. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 43.
Perhaps an arrangement can be reached.
There will be no arrangement -- -- and you're killing her!
But if there can be no arrangement, then we are at an impasse.
I'm afraid so -- I can't compete with you physically. And you're no match for my brains.
I'm afraid so -- I can't compete with you physically. And you're no match for my brains.

Good. Then pour the wine.
Inhale this, but do not touch.
I smell nothing.

What you do not smell is called iocane powder. It is odorless, tasteless, dissolves instantly in liquid, and is among the more deadlier poisons known to man.

Hmm.
Now, a clever man would put the poison into his own goblet, because he would know that only a great fool would reach for what he was given. I'm not a great fool, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But you must have known I was not a great fool; you would have counted on it, so I

Not remotely. Because iocane comes from Australia, as everyone knows. And Australia is entirely peopled with criminals. And criminals are used to having people not trust them, as you are not trusted by me. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you.

You're just stalling now.
You'd like to think that, wouldn't you? You've beaten my giant, which means you're exceptionally strong. So, you could have put the poison in your own goblet, trusting on your strength to save you.

All right. Get a hold of yourself. Take a deep breath, let it out slowly and tell me who you are.
I'm Leo Bloom, I'm an accountant, I'm from Whitehall and Marks, I was sent here to do your books and I'm terribly sorry I caught you with the old lady.
Yes sir.
Then account for yourself! Do you believe in God? Do you believe in gold? Why are you looking up old lady's dresses? Bit of a pervert, eh?
But sir, I'm not condem ...
Shut up. I'm having a rhetorical conversation. How humiliating. Max Bialystock. Max Bialystock.
You have exactly ten seconds to change that disgusting look of pity into one of enormous respect. One ... Two ...

I'm sorry ... I don't like people touching my blue blanket. It's not important. It's a minor compulsion. I can deal with it if I want to. It's just that I've had it ever since I was a baby and ... and ... I find it very comforting.

Mr. Bialystock ...
Mr. Bialystock ...
Yes, Prince Mishkin, what can we do for you?
This is hardly a time for levity. I've discovered a serious error here in the accounts of your last play.
Where? What?
Where? What?
According to the backer's list you raised $60,000. But the show you produced only cost fifty-eight thousand. There's two thousand dollars unaccounted for.

Why should they find out? It's only two thousand dollars, Bloom, do me a favor, move a few decimal points around. You can do it. You're an accountant. The word 'count' is part of your title.

But that's cheating!
But that's cheating!
It's not cheating ... It's charity. Bloom, look at me ... look at me! I'm drowning. Other men sail through life. Bialystock has struck a reef. Bloom, I'm going under. I am being sunk by a society that demands success, when all I can offer is failure. Bloom, I'm reaching out to you. Don't send me to jail. Help! Help!
Help!
All right. I'll do it. I'll do it.
All right. I'll do it. I'll do it.
Thank you, Bloom. I knew I could con you.
Thank you, Bloom. I knew I could con you.
Oh, it's all right ... wha?
Oh, it's all right ... wha?
Nothing. Nothing. Do it. Do it.
Nothing. Nothing. Do it. Do it.
Now let's see, two thousand dollars. That isn't much. I'm sure I can hide it somewhere. After all, the department of internal revenue isn't interested in a show that flopped.

Yes, it's quite possible.
Yes, it's quite possible.
You keep saying that, but you don't tell me how. How could a producer make more money with a flop than with a hit?
Assume away!
Well, it's very easy. You simply raise more money than you really need.

One night.
See? You could have raised a million dollars, put on a sixty thousand dollar flop and kept the rest.
But what if the play was a hit?
But what if the play was a hit?
Oh, you'd go to jail. If the play were a hit, you'd have to pay off the backers, and with so many backers there could never be enough profits to go around, get it?

Aha, aha, aha, aha, aha, aha!! So, in order for the scheme to work, we'd have to find a sure fire flop.

Bloom, worlds are turned on such thoughts!
Mr. Bialystock. No. Wait. Please. You're holding me too tight. I'm an honest man. You don't understand.
No, Bloom, you don't understand. This is fate, this is destiny. There's no avoiding it.
No, Bloom, you don't understand. This is fate, this is destiny. There's no avoiding it.
Mr. Bialystock, not more than five minutes ago, against my better judgment, I doctored your books. That, sir, is the ultimate extent of my criminal life.
Oh, I fell on my keys. I've got to get out of here.

You think you're not in prison now? Living in a grey little room. Going to a grey little job. Leading a grey little life.
You're right. You're absolutely right. I'm a nothing. I spend my life counting other people's money -- people I'm smarter than, better than. Where's my share? Where's Leo Bloom's share? I want, I want, I want, I want everything I've ever seen in the movies!
You bet your boots, Leo. It's Bialystock and Bloom -- on the rise. Upward and onward. Say, you'll join me. Nothing can stop us.
I'll do it! By God, I'll do it!
I'll do it! By God, I'll do it!

I called her sister, Mr. Lowery, where she works, the Music Makers Music Store, you know? And she doesn't know where Mary is any more than we do.

You better run out to the house. She may be... unable to answer the phone...
You better run out to the house. She may be... unable to answer the phone...
Her sister's going to do that. She's as worried as we are.
Will you help us? I think something's wrong out there!
Now. Your sister is missing how long?

She left Phoenix a week ago yesterday. And no trace until...
She left Phoenix a week ago yesterday. And no trace until...
How'd you and this detective come to trace her to Fairvale?
Yes.
She ain't missing so much as she's run away.
She stole some money.
A lot?
A lot?
Forty thousand dollars.
Forty thousand dollars.
And the police haven't been able to...
Mary had been there, one night, and had left.
With the forty thousand dollars?
With the forty thousand dollars?
He didn't mention the money. What he said on the phone isn't important, is it? He was supposed to come back after he spoke to the mother, and he didn't! That's what I want you to do something about!

Go out there! Find somebody, ask some questions! I'm sorry if I seem over-anxious to you. I keep thinking... something's wrong. I have to know what!
Go out there! Find somebody, ask some questions! I'm sorry if I seem over-anxious to you. I keep thinking... something's wrong. I have to know what!
I think something's wrong, too, Miss. But not the same thing. I think your private detective is what's wrong. I think he got himself a hot lead as to where your sister was going... probably from Norman Bates... and called you to keep you still while he took off after her and the money.

He said he was dissatisfied... and was going back.
Please!
Sorry I got you up, boy. Go back to sleep. Yeah, be glad to. Said to give you his regards.
You should've called in the police the second you found your sister has skipped. You go starting private investigations, using people you don't even know...
What difference does that...
What difference does that...
Your Detective told you a nakedfaced lie.
Yes.
Norman Bates' mother has been dead and buried in Greenlawn Cemetery for the last ten years!
Did he say anything about my sister?
Just what he told your detective.
I still feel...
Can see you do. Sorry I couldn't make you feel better. You want to come to my office this afternoon and report a missing person... And the theft, is what you want to do! Sooner you drop this thing in the lap of the law, that's the sooner you'll stand a chance of your sister bein' picked up. How about that?

Look, if you two are in this thing together, I don't care, it's none of my business... But I want to see Mary. I want her to tell me she's all right and it's none of my business. Then I'll go back to Phoenix and...
What thing?
Huh?
Huh?
What thing could we be in together?

Never mind my ego. Let's talk about Mary.
Yes... I just... did. The moment they told me...
You might have doubted for say five minutes or so, Sister.
I just listened... and believed everything they told me. 'She stole the money.' 'We don't want to get her in trouble.' 'No don't bring the police in'...
It was her boss' idea not to report it to the police?

This is Lila Crane, from Phoenix. She's been here for a few days, looking for her sister. There's a private detective helping... and, well, we got a call tonight, from this detective, saying he'd traced Mary...
I've only been here five. Right now it feels like ten, but...
All right! Then call! At least, call!
Maybe I am the seeing-illusions type.
You're not.
I won't feel satisfied unless I got out there, Sam.
Neither will I.
I wonder if we'll ever see Mary again.
Of course we will.
Of course we will.
Alive.
Where'd you go to college?
I didn't. I got a job, too. I wonder if that hurt her, my not letting her sacrifice for me? Some people are so willing to suffer for you that they suffer more if you don't let them.
I didn't. I got a job, too. I wonder if that hurt her, my not letting her sacrifice for me? Some people are so willing to suffer for you that they suffer more if you don't let them.
She was willing to lick the stamps.
I wonder so many things about her now. Why she never told me about you... Funny, when you think there's an answer to everything, you think you know all the answers.
We were going to get married. Are going to get married!

I wonder where Norman Bates does his hermiting?
Someone was at that window. I saw the curtain move.
We should have asked for Cabin One... The one Mary was in.
I'm glad we didn't.
We have to go into that cabin and search it, Sam... no matter what we're afraid of finding and no matter how much it may hurt.
I know. Do you think if something happened, it happened there?

Sam, if you owned a useless business like this motel... one you probably couldn't even sell... what would you need to get away, to start a new business, somewhere else? Forty thousand dollars?

What makes you sound so certain?
What makes you sound so certain?
Arbogast! Sam, he liked me... or felt sorry for me... and he was starting to feel the same about you. I heard it when he called... in his voice, a caring. He wouldn't have gone anywhere or done anything without telling us. Unless he was stopped. And he was stopped, so he must have found out something!
Sorry.
Hospital clean.
Hospital clean.
What?
What?
The bathroom. Look at how clean it is. The one in our cabin is clean... but this is clean!
What is it?
It didn't get washed down. It's figuring... the kind you tear up and get rid of. Some figure has been added to or subtracted from... forty thousand.
That's proof Mary was here! It would be too wild a coincidence for somebody else to...
Bates never denied Mary was here.
Bates never denied Mary was here.
Yes. But maybe this proves that Bates found out about the money.

Do we simply ask him where he's hidden it?

Sam, that old woman, whoever she is. I think she told Arbogast something! And I want her to tell us the same thing!
You can't go up there.
Why not?
Why not?
Bates.
It's regular. Okay?
I could stand something regular.
Call your boss and tell him you're taking the rest of the afternoon off. It's Friday anyway... and hot.

You make respectability sound... disrespectful.

I'm all for it! It requires patience and temperance and a lot of sweating- out... otherwise, though, it's only hard work. But if I can see you, touch you even as simply as this... I won't mind.
I'm fed up with sweating for people who aren't there. I sweat to pay off my father's debts... and he's in his grave... I sweat to pay my ex-wife alimony, and she's living on the other side of the world somewhere.
I pay, too. They also pay who meet in hotel rooms.

You're very... kind.
It's all for you. I'm not hungry. Please go ahead.
You eat like a bird.
You'd know, of course.
You'd know, of course.
Not really. I hear that expression, that one eats "like a bird," is really a falsie, I mean a falsity, because birds eat a tremendous lot. Oh, I don't know anything about birds.

No. People never run away from anything. The rain didn't last very long. You know what I think? I think we're all in our private traps, clamped in them, and none of us can ever climb out. We scratch and claw... but only at the air, only at each other, and for all of it, we never budge an inch.

Sometimes when she talks that way to me I'd like to... curse her out and leave her forever! Or at least, defy her. But I couldn't. She's ill.

It's too late for me. And besides... who'd look after her? She'd be alone up there, the fire would go out... damp and cold, like a grave. When you love someone, you don't do that to them, even if you hate them. Oh, I don't hate her. I hate... what she's become. I hate... the illness.

I've suggested it myself. But I hate to even think such a thing. She needs me... and it isn't... ...it isn't as if she were a maniac, a raving thing... it's just that... sometimes she goes a little mad. We all go a little mad sometimes. Haven't you?
Yes, and just one time can be enough. Thank you.

In the course of my duty, I never "take up" anyone's time, whether it's to give a warning, or a ticket, or help! Believe that, M'am. Now if you woke up on the wrong side of... the car seat, that's one thing. But when you act as if I've just placed you under arrest...
I'm sorry.

No need to apologize...

You didn't! It's tinkerbell. Al wants to be sure he'll hear it if anyone rings it in the middle of the night. Well come on in, at least!
We have a problem.
Let's go out back and have some coca while the men are talking.
Mary is Lila's sister?
Yes. He traced her to that motel, out on the old highway...
Yes. He traced her to that motel, out on the old highway...
Bates' Motel. He has a mind like a mechanical brain and the more information you feed it... Go on, Sam.

Norman took a wife?
Norman took a wife?
No. An old woman, his mother. That was early this evening. And we haven't seen or heard from him since. I went out to the motel, just got back. No one was in the office, and...
You mean that old woman I saw sittin' in the window wasn't Norman Bates' mother?
Maybe you saw Mary!
Maybe you saw Mary!
I'd know the difference between Mary and an old woman.
We thought, if you didn't mind, we'd go out to the motel with you.
He's already been.
Why don't you call Norman and let him say just what happened, if he give the man a hot lead and he did just scooted off... it'll make the girl feel better, Albert.
At this hour?
Recluse. Kinder word.
You must remember that bad business out there. About ten years ago...
Norman? Sheriff Chambers. Been just fine, thanks. Listen, we got some worries here. Did you have a man stop out there tonight... Well, this one wouldn't be a customer, anyway. A private detective, name of...
Arbogast.
Arbogast.
Arbogast. And after he left? No, it's okay, Norman. How's it been going out there? Well, I think you oughta unload that place and open up closer in to the action, a smaller place, you know... but...
Barefaced.
He told you he wasn't coming right back cause he wanted to question Norman Bates' mother, right?
I helped Norman pick out the dress she was buried in. Periwinkle blue.
It ain't only local history, Sam, it's the only murder-and-suicide case in Fairvale ledgers! Mrs. Bates poisoned this guy she was... involved with, when she found out he was married, then took a helping of the same stuff herself. Strychnine. Ugly way to die.

Norman found them dead together. In bed.
Went out before service.
Have you two had breakfast?
Just coming up to ring for you.
I suppose you want a cabin.
I suppose you want a cabin.
We'd hoped to make it straight to San Francisco, but we don't like the look of that sky. Looks like a bad day coming... doesn't it.
I'll take you to...
Better sign in first, hasn't we?
It isn't necessary.
Uh, uh! My boss is paying for this trip... ninety percent business... and he wants practically notarized receipts. I better sign in and get a receipt.
I'll get your bags.
Haven't any.
Haven't any.
I'll show you the cabin.
Looking for me?
Yes, matter of fact. The wife's taking a nap and... I can never keep quiet enough for her... so I thought I'd look you up and... talk.
Yes, matter of fact. The wife's taking a nap and... I can never keep quiet enough for her... so I thought I'd look you up and... talk.
Satisfied with your cabin?
Satisfied with your cabin?
Fine.
I've been doing all the talking so far, haven't I?
Yes.
Yes.
I always thought it was the people who are alone so much who do all the talking when they get the chance. Yet there you are, doing all the listening! You are alone here, aren't you? It would drive me crazy.

That would be a rather extreme reaction, wouldn't it?
Just an expression... What I meant was... I'd do just about anything... to get away. Wouldn't you?
I'm not saying you shouldn't be contented here, I'm just doubting that you are. I think if you saw a chance to get out from under... you'd unload this place...
This place! This isn't 'a place.' It's my only world. I grew up in that house back there. I was a happy child. My mother and I... we were more than happy.

And now that your mother's dead?
My mother is not dead!
I didn't think so.
You look frightened. Have I been saying something frightening?
I don't know what you've been saying.
I don't know what you've been saying.
I've been talking about your mother... about your motel. How are you going to do it?

Go on, go tell her she'll not be appeasing her ugly appetite with my food... or my son! Or do I have to tell her, cause you don't have the guts? Huh, boy? You have the guts, boy?
Go on, go tell her she'll not be appeasing her ugly appetite with my food... or my son! Or do I have to tell her, cause you don't have the guts? Huh, boy? You have the guts, boy?
Shut up! Shut up!
They thought she'd be coming to me.
Left Phoenix under her own steam?
Yes.
From what?
Everyone concerned thought... if they could get her to give back the money... they could avoid involving her with the police.
Explains the private detective. He traced her to the Bates place. What'd he exactly say when he called you?
He was out when I was there. If he's back he probably isn't even in bed yet.
He wasn't out when you were there. He just wasn't answering the door in the dead of night... like some people do. This fellow lives like a hermit...
Was that all?
This detective was out there and Norman told him about the girl and the detective thanked him and went away.
Now wait a minute, Sam. You sure you saw an old woman?
Yes! In the house behind the motel. I pounded and called but she... just ignored me.
Yes! In the house behind the motel. I pounded and called but she... just ignored me.
And you want to tell me you saw Norman Bates' mother.
You didn't find anything.
Nothing. Here, let's clear the path.
No mother.
You must've seen an illusion, Sam. Now, I know you're not the seeing- illusion type... But no woman was illusion there and I don't believe in ghosts, so there it is!
By gosh, them stiffs are get- tin' heavier and more of 'em every day. They even got the coroner working overtime.
Yeah, between the gangsters and the autos, we won't need another war to carry off the population.

Sure, got thousand cats, too. Look at 'em-- Points to cages of cats.
What' s the idea [of wanting so many] do you sell them [to the doctor]?

But where do the rats come in?
But where do the rats come in?
You're not as quick as I thought. I figgered out that rats breed faster than cats-- cat skins make good fur-- The cats eat rats. Rats eat raw meat. That is, they eat the carcasses of the cats. So --the cats eat the rats--the rats eat the cats. And I get the skins--simple ain't it?
Oh, him. He has a cat of his own. But his assistant--he's the cat-hatenest man I ever saw. Goofy, if ya ast me.]
By the way--did you hear a shot last night?
I'm detective Jones. Just dropped in to tell you a bit of news.

Yes. Mr. Buckley thinks you treated him a little rough. He's in the hospital. How about it?
Oh, nothing. He is crazy, that's all. I had a little trouble with him.
What's that?
Oh, nothing. A cou- ple of my patients having a little argument.

He isn't here.
What are you going to do?
I'm going to call the police.
I'm going to call the police.
No, you can't do that--they'll get suspicious--
You can't double-cross me like that. You were to help me. You were to operate on him. You were going to put him under my power.
Not so fast, Mrs. Buckley. That was your idea!
You are right. But before I can get him back here, you will have to help me.
How? What can I do?
[Something very important. I have been threatened;] Mrs. Maxwell, my assistant's wife, is crazy. She thinks I mur- dered her husband. [She wants to murder me.] I want you to help me quiet her-- give her a shot from this hypo. [Keep it hid till we get her] down in the basement-- there is a secret vault [there].

By the time we return there, all the preparations for the blood transfusion are completed.
Joseph returns from the room where Gisèle is. He has evidently succeeded in calming her. He goes and sits in the chair where Nikolas sat. He rests his head in his hand. He sees the open diary and begins reading it.

The blood transfusion is now in progress. The only words are curt orders like: 'Now! - Quickly! - That's enough! - Give it to me! - Sit still!' etc.

It's Igor at the Wax Museum! You'll find your judge embalmed in wax! He's a statue of Voltaire, with all the other corpses! The whole place is a morgue -- do you hear? -- a morgue!
Yes, why?
I wondered. Did he invite you to lunch, or did you invite him?

I wish you wouldn't be so sarcastic about Ralph. He's the sweetest kid I know.
What are you laughing at?

I don't have any affairs. What do you mean?
I don't think you could have a real affair. You couldn't care for anyone.

I've been in love so many times my heart is calloused ... but I've never hit one with dough. This love-in-an-attic isn't my idea of a way to spend a pleasant afternoon.

Then marry Ralph ... you'll be the happiest couple in the world.
But what about lunch?
I'll have it for supper. So long.
There's no hurry. It's early.
I can't convince the inner woman that we can wait. She's howling for a bit of ground beef before we drop in on Santa Claus and the other dummies. I've only had a cup of coffee since last night.

Well, thank goodness, that's settled.
Disappoint me? Why, what do you mean, dear?
Well, you see, the old chap is pretty anxious to open on schedule. All of his advertising announced the opening tonight.
Why, certainly, sir. My fiancée. Charlotte, may I present Mr. Igor.
Delighted, I'm sure.
But why? She's the best friend I've got.
She isn't anybody's friend, and I don't like you living with her. She's a bad influence.

If you will forgive this poor, crippled stump, my dear, I am very happy to know you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Although you would be amused if I were to tell you that I knew you before you were born. Before this terrible thing happened to me ... ... I made a very beautiful statue. Even if I had not met with this disaster, I could never have hoped to do anything finer, probably nothing quite so fine. And, my child, you are that figure

I'd love to, at any time.
We'll be coming to the opening.
At any time. You will always be welcome.
But I think these things are beautiful.
They are. My boy, I think you are right. Everyone is tired out today and now that we have seen my doors open in a new country, I am beginning to realize that I am a little tired myself. You can call that fellow in from the front. I think we'll close for the night.
Oh! Mr. Igor! -- I'm so glad you're here -- I don't know why I should be, but I was a little bit afraid.
Oh! So, my little friend, you have honored me by accepting my invitation of last night.

Oh, please, Mr. Igor, I'm terribly ashamed. I shouldn't have put you to so much trouble.
It is no trouble at all, my child. This is the strange, vicarious pleasure that remains for me -- to see others enjoy the beauty I used to create. My footing is not too secure.
Let me go! Let me go!
We have found immortality, you and I. You must not be afraid.

Please, oh, please, I haven't done anything to hurt you.

The body of Joan Gale!

Well, I'll tell you a secret. I kinda like the old gent and I'm trying to build a special Sunday Magazine story out of him. It might help him a whole lot. But that's a side issue -- something I do on my own time.
Gee, that's great. After the bad opening that night the old boy was pretty blue. This will pep him up. Have you told him about it?
Gee, that's great. After the bad opening that night the old boy was pretty blue. This will pep him up. Have you told him about it?
No. I wanted to do it without saying anything. I think he's worth it.
Ralph, come here a minute, will you?
Better cut that out. That's what happens to girls who bite their nails. What's wrong?
Yeah. I suppose you people will crucify me for something I didn't do. I didn't! You understand that! ... I didn't do it! She -- tried before --
Come on, old man, that won't do. You know you're innocent until proven guilty.
Come on, old man, that won't do. You know you're innocent until proven guilty.
Yes, sure, that's fine. While I'm proving my innocence, you people are going to uncover every petty kid trick I ever did ... you're going to write editorials about every cocktail I ever drank. Anything that any sane, normal person might have done will have a sinister meaning, if I did it. Go on! Get out! I don't want to talk to you!
Listen, kid. You're in a tough spot, and you can make it a whole lot easier for yourself if you cut out the cry-baby stuff --
Cry-baby?

Not even if it gives you a clean bill of health?

No! You ought to be ashamed of yourself astin' such a nasty things a child your age!
Can't I touch it a little, Rose -- not a lot, just a little?
Can't I touch it a little, Rose -- not a lot, just a little?
Of course you can't! I'm... I'm shocked at you, Buddy, real shocked! Now you be quiet or I'm going back to my own bed!
Of course you can't! I'm... I'm shocked at you, Buddy, real shocked! Now you be quiet or I'm going back to my own bed!
Please, Rose. I'm curious, that's all, I have a natural curiosity, it's only human. You're my friend, aren't you? Don't you like me? I like you, Rose, a lot -- in fact, I love you.
Please, Rose. I'm curious, that's all, I have a natural curiosity, it's only human. You're my friend, aren't you? Don't you like me? I like you, Rose, a lot -- in fact, I love you.
Well, you're sweet, but you don't really love me.
Well, you're sweet, but you don't really love me.
Yes, I do. Please, Rose, be a good sport.
Yes, I do. Please, Rose, be a good sport.
Buddy, you're just a child.
Buddy, you're just a child.
I'm thirteen. And I have a natural curiosity. It's only nature, Rose, that's all. Now what's wrong with nature, huh?
I'm thirteen. And I have a natural curiosity. It's only nature, Rose, that's all. Now what's wrong with nature, huh?
Well, nothin'.
You better quit that.
But Rose...
But Rose...
I must be outta my mind. Buddy, quit it.
I must be outta my mind. Buddy, quit it.
Am I hurting you?
Am I hurting you?
No. No, you're not hurting me. But I think you better quit it.
No. No, you're not hurting me. But I think you better quit it.
But why, if I'm not hurting you?
But why, if I'm not hurting you?
You wouldn't understand. Oh, God, I must be outta my mind. What would your Momma think?
Rose, are you all right? Are you sick or something?
No. No, I'm all right. Oh, God, what have I done? I have robbed a cradle and fallen into hell! I must be crazy, a child like you. Oh, God, oh, Lord. This is awful, this is terrible, I gotta get outta here!
Buddy, you wouldn't tell nobody, would you?
Don't worry, Rose, I won't tell a soul.
Don't worry, Rose, I won't tell a soul.
I sure hope you don't. I gotta get outta here, good night.
I sure hope you don't. I gotta get outta here, good night.
Good night, Rose.
I hate to turn on this light, you Daddy's awake downstairs, but I have to take the chance. Buddy, please don't tell on me.
I said I wouldn't.
I said I wouldn't.
Buddy, I have to ask you, as bad as I've been please have pity on me and don't ruin me by telling them what I did. I know it was bad, it was bad and dumb. But mostly it was dumb, I didn't mean you no harm, I'd never want to hurt a hair on your head and that's the truth. I love you.
Rose, they could stick splinters under my fingernails, and I will never say a word! I will never tell them, because... I love you!
Oh, Buddy, you do love me! I knew you did, knew it all the time...
Well, Ill tell you this. I have learned a lesson tonight. I wasn't gonna run around, but when I start botherin' your Daddy and worse robbin' a cradle, I gotta face the facts of life. Tomorrow mornin', I'm gonna get myself up and go out.
You're going to get yourself up and go out?
You're going to get yourself up and go out?
Buddy, Mr. Right is out there somewhere and I'm gonna find him!
Here comes Daddy.
I have a knack for designing clothes. But I had to buy the shoes and the pocketbook.
Did your Momma really give you castor oil?
Yeah.
Yeah.
You're my sweetheart.
Rose, you must know who the fellow is.
Well, he might be that man who followed me home from the store the other day. But I don't know who he is, Buddy, I really don't.
I got an awful toothache.
Rose, if you don't keep your boyfriends away from the house, Daddy is going to fire you.
Rose, if you don't keep your boyfriends away from the house, Daddy is going to fire you.
But I don't know who they are.
Oh, he's so kind, so gentle inside, and so unhappy with that rich wife who doesn't understand him, her being a Southerner and everything, and what a bedside manner he has got -- so gentle and kind beneath the professor way he acts!
Rose, you are too uncritical of people.
Rose, you are too uncritical of people.
You don't know the bedside manner that man has got. Why, it does me good just to see him sit there all solemn and go pokin' in his bag like he's gonna cure me, which he did of course. And even more important he loves me, like a patient I mean, the other day he got tears in his eyes just listenin' to my

He did?
He did?
Yeah, he tried to hide it but I saw 'em, and a little bit he says to me, "You know, you are beautiful." Now wasn't that a nice thing for a doctor to say to a patient, wasn't it? What could cheer a girl up more?
Yeah, he tried to hide it but I saw 'em, and a little bit he says to me, "You know, you are beautiful." Now wasn't that a nice thing for a doctor to say to a patient, wasn't it? What could cheer a girl up more?
Rose, I have got doubts about that doctor and so does Daddy.
Rose, I have got doubts about that doctor and so does Daddy.
He's got doubts about hisself and that's the saddest thing of all. Would you believe that poor man thinks nobody likes him?
He's got doubts about hisself and that's the saddest thing of all. Would you believe that poor man thinks nobody likes him?
Yeah, I'd believe it.
Yeah, I'd believe it.
Well, I like him. I used to be afraid of doctors but not any more. Why, he could operate on me any old time and I wouldn't even be scared.
Well, I like him. I used to be afraid of doctors but not any more. Why, he could operate on me any old time and I wouldn't even be scared.
Rose, you are just entirely too uncritical of people.
Rose, you are just entirely too uncritical of people.
I ain't neither. Listen here, Buddy, besides all his vast medical knowledge, he has the most kindest heart beneath the professor way he acts -- he wants justice in the world and he's got some real interestin' ideas.
Oh, Buddy, they're gonna cut me all up! They're gonna cut my stummick all open, I'll die!
You won't die, Rose.
You won't die, Rose.
Buddy, I'm scared, I'm scared!
I gotta find out what they're saying. You lie back and rest, Rose, and I'll give you a report on it.
I don't want to know...
Hi, Buddy. How's my sweetheart who never told on me when I was bad?
Okay.
Okay.
Makin' homes for purple martins, huh? We had 'em on the farm. They're the prettiest things. That's what I wish I was, a bird. Just fly around catch bugs and have a lot of fun.

What are you going to do, Rose?
What are you going to do, Rose?
Take a little walk with me, huh?
I guess I'll work as a waitress, Buddy. I done that before and it got me in worse trouble than you could know, but I can't stay here no more. Why did you get rid of your rabbits, Buddy?
They're dumb things. I got tired of them.
They're dumb things. I got tired of them.
Did you know when I was a child we had pretty near five hundred rabbits?
Did you know when I was a child we had pretty near five hundred rabbits?
Five hundred rabbits?
Five hundred rabbits?
Yep, we had 'em in orange crates all over. It was Daddy's dream. He was goin' to get rich raisin' rabbits. It was what killed Daddy. He didn't drown hisself till a long time later after Momma and Lunette died of typhoid, but it was them rabbits what killed him.

How did the rabbits kill him?
How did the rabbits kill him?
He thought he could sell 'em, but nobody but country folks eat rabbits, Buddy, and they ain't got no money. We had to eat them dern rabbits our own selves. Every dern one, and it took about four years to eat 'em all up.

Well, that doctor said you got protein somewhere and I guess he was right.
Well, that doctor said you got protein somewhere and I guess he was right.
Boy did I get sick of rabbit. But later on after Momma died and Daddy wasn't doin' nothin' but drinkin', I sure would of been glad for a little rabbit stew. You know, I oughtn't to of told you about what Daddy done when I was a child. Until them rabbits ruined him, he was a real good man, Buddy.

What was your mother like?
What was your mother like?
A saint just like your own mother. She's up in heaven right now, her and Lunette, there ain't no doubt about it.
Maybe it was eating all those rabbits that made you sexy, Rose.
Buddy, sex don't mean a thing to me. It ain't nothin' but a mosquito bite. I'll tell you a secret. Girls don't want sex, Buddy, girls want love.
Neither do I.
Oh, Waski, you don't even know what we're talking about.
Oh, Waski, you don't even know what we're talking about.
I do, too.
Yeah, I know.
Oh, Waski, you don't know anything.
Oh, Waski, you don't know anything.
I do, too!
I do, too!
All right, what do you know?
All right, what do you know?
Rose is madly in love with Daddy...
He did lie, and... and... and Mother, yesterday he stole money out of your pocketbook!
Quiet, you little muddy-eyed brat, or Ill kill you!
Of course not!
Oh, Waski, you don't even know what we're talking about.
You were up late last night, Brother.
Well, a little.
Well, a little.
Reading dirty comic bocks. And you admitted it?
Reading dirty comic bocks. And you admitted it?
Well, yeah.
Son, was Rose in your room last night?
No. Why should Rose be in my room?
I never saw anything like it. How did she pick him up so fast?
I don't know.
I don't know.
The girl strikes like a cobra.
Is that Doctor still up there, Brother.
Yeah, he's still up there.
Yeah, he's still up there.
What's taking the rascal so long?
What do you think, Brother?
I don't know. But you better watch him like a hawk, if he comes back again.
I don't know. But you better watch him like a hawk, if he comes back again.
He's not coming back again. We scared the rascal off, son. Come on back to supper. Your mother has a theory about how to educate Rose.
See that, son? Now this is a heel, see, and there, that's the ball of a foot. Someone has been walking here.
Well, it's not very plain.
Well, it's not very plain.
That is because it rained recently, the rain has obscured the evidence. But you could still take plaster casts of these footprints, then match up the plaster casts with whosever shoes they are, and that way you could catch him -- understand?
That is because it rained recently, the rain has obscured the evidence. But you could still take plaster casts of these footprints, then match up the plaster casts with whosever shoes they are, and that way you could catch him -- understand?
But how would you find him?
But how would you find him?
Well. Well, what I mean is, you could prove it was his shoes if you did catch him. But look this, Brother, it is even more interesting. Look at this mark here, and that mark over there. Now wouldn't you say those marks are the marks of a ladder?
Well. Well, what I mean is, you could prove it was his shoes if you did catch him. But look this, Brother, it is even more interesting. Look at this mark here, and that mark over there. Now wouldn't you say those marks are the marks of a ladder?
Well, I don't know. No, I don't know, Daddy, I think the rain has obscured it.
Well, I don't know. No, I don't know, Daddy, I think the rain has obscured it.
True, but if you look sharply you can see that those marks are the marks of a ladder. Now let's go back to the garage and see if the ladder has been tampered with.
See, son? The paint is flaked off here, freshly. Look at it, Brother, there is no question about it. Some person or persons unknown have very recently tampered with this ladder.
Well... maybe...
Well... maybe...
And there's only one reason anybody would want this ladder -- to get up into Rose's bedroom in the dark of night! I am going to chain up this ladder and padlock it! -- and that is not all I am going to do!
Open that door, damn you!
Daddy, what's the matter?
Daddy, what's the matter?
She's got somebody in there, Brother! His shoes are on the back porch -- there they were, naked and smiling at me! Rose, open this door immediately!
I heard you talking. Hasn't Rose come in?
No, she hasn't. I think I hear a car.
The new girl is here.
Wonderful. What's she like, Brother? What is your impression of her?
Wonderful. What's she like, Brother? What is your impression of her?
She talks a great deal and smiles a lot. She's very pretty, she has a real good figure. She's very girlish or womanish, if you know what I mean. She wouldn't hurt anybody, this girl. She couldn't.
Your impression is very reassuring, Brother. Of course she's had troubles, poor thing, but I sensed that was that the girl was like and I'm glad to have it reconfirmed.
You mean confirmed, Mother. I didn't confirm it before. I would have had to confirm it previously, in order for it to be reconfirmed.
You mean confirmed, Mother. I didn't confirm it before. I would have had to confirm it previously, in order for it to be reconfirmed.
All right, all right. Doll and Waski are upstairs taking their nap, you go get them and bring them down to the living room. Where is the girl?
All right, all right. Doll and Waski are upstairs taking their nap, you go get them and bring them down to the living room. Where is the girl?
In the kitchen drinking all the ice water in Glenville. She walked out here, she didn't go by the hotel.
In the kitchen drinking all the ice water in Glenville. She walked out here, she didn't go by the hotel.
Walked, in all that heat? It's a wonder she hasn't got sunstroke. I'll phone Daddy and you go get Doll Baby and Waski.
Brother, when I have to wake you up at eleven o'clock in the morning you're either sick or you were up very late last night. And you weren't reading Huckleberry Finn. I looked and its not in your room. Now what were you doing?
Mother, I have to tell the truth. I wasn't reading Huckleberry Finn, I was reading one of those Little Dirty Comic Books.
Mother, I have to tell the truth. I wasn't reading Huckleberry Finn, I was reading one of those Little Dirty Comic Books.
Oh, Brother, I am so disappointed in you. You mustn't look at those horrible things, they degrade the human image.
Mother, cant you make it calomel instead of castor oil?
This is for your own good. When you look at negative, destructive things like those little filthy comic books, you are sick. Here, take this.

Geccch, yehh, guhhhh!
Geccch, yehh, guhhhh!
Stop gagging like that and putting on a show, and swallow it.
Stop gagging like that and putting on a show, and swallow it.
Uhhh, gahdam stuff!
Uhhh, gahdam stuff!
What did you say, Brother?
What did you say, Brother?
I said ahhh-dam stuff.
I said ahhh-dam stuff.
No, you didn't say that, Brother.
No, you didn't say that, Brother.
Yes, I did, mother. Your hearing aid isn't working right. I said ahhh-dam stuff.
Children, children! Be quiet, all of you! The vibrations in this house are strange today. Where's Rose, anyhow?
She's getting herself up to go out.
She's getting herself up to go out.
What'd you say, Brother?
What'd you say, Brother?
She's getting herself up to go out. I think she's coming down the hall now.
She's getting herself up to go out. I think she's coming down the hall now.
Oh, yes, it's Thursday. Hello, Rose, dear... ... my, you're... looking pretty...
Heh, what a hypocrite.
I do wish you'd speak to Brother. It's true he's been looking at those horrible little books again.
Excuse me, gotta go to bathroom.
Now I have a plan about Rose, an educational plan. She's getting better and we don't want any more trouble -- Brother, you ought to hear this.
Now I have a plan about Rose, an educational plan. She's getting better and we don't want any more trouble -- Brother, you ought to hear this.
I'll be right back.
Rose is almost as sentimental as Mother. If there's one thing I can't stand it's sentimentality. In Chattanooga this man committed an almost perfect murder. He killed his wife with a black widow spider.
Oh, shut up, Buddy.
Daddy says Rose is calm as lettuce. Do you believe that, Doll?
No.
It's pitiful. Neither one of them know.
I think Daddy suspects.
I think Daddy suspects.
No, he doesn't. Not really.
It's really pitiful. She's in bad shape.
She's watching the car again?
She's watching the car again?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I get so irritated with Daddy. He's so dumb sometimes.
There goes Mother.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Let's go peep from the living room.
Let's go peep from the living room.
Okay.
I think she's gonna kiss him.
At least.
I can't see. What are they doing, what's happening?
They're discussing it.
They're discussing it.
I can't see, let me see...
This is my place and you can't have it.
Ohhh-hh... what's happening now?
Ohhh-hh... what's happening now?
He's trying to get up -- good God, one of her titties is out!
He's trying to get up -- good God, one of her titties is out!
Let me see!
Now I can't see. What are they doing?
Boy! Wow!
Wow! Brrrother!
What are they doing?
What are they doing?
Buddy, this is amazing, you wouldn't believe it.
Buddy, this is amazing, you wouldn't believe it.
What are they doing, Doll?
What are they doing, Doll?
He kissed her.
He kissed her.
Is that all?
Is that all?
He had his hand on her titty.
He had his hand on her titty.
Let me look. Aww-rr...
She's putting the titty back.
Buddy, that was my place.
Buddy, that was pretty snotty of you, pushing me away like that just when it was interesting.
You shouldn't watch such things, Doll.
Wasn't Daddy wonderful? He wanted to kiss her some more and play with her, but he didn't, because he loves Mother and all of us, and he loves Rose, too. Isn't he wonderful, isn't he great?
Wonderful? He kissed her and played with her titty, and I don't see anything so great about that. He was probably afraid Mother would come back early and catch him.
Wonderful? He kissed her and played with her titty, and I don't see anything so great about that. He was probably afraid Mother would come back early and catch him.
You know, Buddy, sometimes you make me sick.
No, Mother, he's lying...
Shut up, Doll. I'll cut your guts
Chattanooga. I had St. Louis, Missouri.
Buddy, I'm worried about Rose.
Buddy, I'm worried about Rose.
So am I.
So am I.
She hasn't got any sense. In some ways, she's awful dumb.
She hasn't got any sense. In some ways, she's awful dumb.
It isn't that she hasn't got any sense, Doll. Her basic intelligence is probably above average, maybe quite a bit above average.
It isn't that she hasn't got any sense, Doll. Her basic intelligence is probably above average, maybe quite a bit above average.
Then why does she act so dumb?
Then why does she act so dumb?
Dumbness doesn't concern her, Doll. And neither does smartness. You see --
What is Rose going to do? Where can she go?
They've been in there the longest kind of time. I can't stand it, I gotta find out what's going on.
They've been in there the longest kind of time. I can't stand it, I gotta find out what's going on.
You better not snoop, Daddy'll kill you!
What's happening?
Mother is struggling desperately. In fact she's fighting like a tiger. But I don't know, it's close, it's mighty close.
Mother is struggling desperately. In fact she's fighting like a tiger. But I don't know, it's close, it's mighty close.
Buddy... does Rose really... "do it" with all those boys and men?
Buddy... does Rose really... "do it" with all those boys and men?
Doll, don't ask childish questions.
Well, if she's got any sense at all, she'll listen to that.
Sense doesn't mean anything to Rose. But I think we're on safe ground now. Daddy chained up the ladder, whoever it is can't get in the house.
What's goin' on?
Rose says she's goin' to have a baby and she sure looks it, but I don't think so.
Rose says she's goin' to have a baby and she sure looks it, but I don't think so.
A baby... and she isn't even married.
A baby... and she isn't even married.
That's the least of her troubles. Rose had a rare tropic disease and the little tubes in her that babies swim down are all stopped up, she told me all about it.
That's the least of her troubles. Rose had a rare tropic disease and the little tubes in her that babies swim down are all stopped up, she told me all about it.
If it isn't a baby... what is it?
Why is it taking so long?
Here comes Daddy.
Well, you rascal, where'd you come from?
Hello, Daddy. How are you?
Hello, Daddy. How are you?
About as good as can be expected with one foot in the grave. Good to see you, son. Did you bring any of that Yankee whisky with you?
About as good as can be expected with one foot in the grave. Good to see you, son. Did you bring any of that Yankee whisky with you?
It isn't Yankee whisky, Daddy, it's Scotch.
It isn't Yankee whisky, Daddy, it's Scotch.
It's Yankee whisky to me.
I can use a drink after the plane ride I had.
Your wife and children are back in New Hampshire in the snow?
Your wife and children are back in New Hampshire in the snow?
Yeah, they're in the snow.
Are they polar bears, too?
Good God, the way you live here. This place hasn't been dusted since Mother died. Look at that goddamned refrigerator.
Good God, the way you live here. This place hasn't been dusted since Mother died. Look at that goddamned refrigerator.
Got another twenty years in it, boy. By the way, son, do you recall Rose, that pretty blonde girl who came to our house way back in 1935 or 1936 and caused such a damnable commotion.
Got another twenty years in it, boy. By the way, son, do you recall Rose, that pretty blonde girl who came to our house way back in 1935 or 1936 and caused such a damnable commotion.
Of course I recall Rose. In fact I've been thinking of no one else for the last hour and a half.
Of course I recall Rose. In fact I've been thinking of no one else for the last hour and a half.
How could that be, son?
How could that be, son?
Dave Wilkie of all people was sitting by me on the plane -- her first husband. It's funny you would mention Rose. Did you hear from her?
What's all this about Rose? What do you mean, you heard from her in a manner of speaking?
Oh, I heard from her, I got a letter from her, she's fine. But there is some sad news.
Oh, I heard from her, I got a letter from her, she's fine. But there is some sad news.
What sad news? Did her cancer come back?
What sad news? Did her cancer come back?
Oh, no, no, she got all over that. Rose is fine. Let's sit down, son.
Oh, no, no, she got all over that. Rose is fine. Let's sit down, son.
Is her husband sick or something?
Is her husband sick or something?
No, it's another thing. I was going to write you about it, but since you were coming down anyway I thought I'd wait till you got here. What did Dave Wilkie have to say?
The pitiful son of a bitch said Rose was a nymphomaniac.
Um-hmm, and I suppose that incensed you?
Um-hmm, and I suppose that incensed you?
You're damn right it incensed me, the miserable bastard. He also said the kikes and the niggers have taken over Washington. D.C.
You're damn right it incensed me, the miserable bastard. He also said the kikes and the niggers have taken over Washington. D.C.
Yeah, I know, he was up here. It's pitiful like you say. When he lost Rose it ruined the man, it destroyed him totally when he lost Rose.
Yeah, I know, he was up here. It's pitiful like you say. When he lost Rose it ruined the man, it destroyed him totally when he lost Rose.
He didn't lose her, he threw her away.
He didn't lose her, he threw her away.
Yes, I guess he did. He threw her away and it was the mistake of his life.
Yes, I guess he did. He threw her away and it was the mistake of his life.
You know, I don't know this town any more. All this traffic, new buildings, prosperity... Where have the years gone, Daddy? Where is the little town I knew as a boy?
You know, I don't know this town any more. All this traffic, new buildings, prosperity... Where have the years gone, Daddy? Where is the little town I knew as a boy?
At rest in the creative universe with Mother, son.

That's what she would say herself.

A wonderful woman, boy.

It always gives me a funny feeling to come home. Dear old Southland. Gone. It's all gone, Daddy -- -- except you, you're still here.

Not for long, boy. I've outstayed my welcome already.
Not for long, boy. I've outstayed my welcome already.
It's funny you would mention Rose, I was thinking about her all the way up in the car. Or maybe it isn't so funny.
It's funny you would mention Rose, I was thinking about her all the way up in the car. Or maybe it isn't so funny.
I'm older than hell, boy. But this Yankee whisky is mighty fine, I'll say that.
I'm older than hell, boy. But this Yankee whisky is mighty fine, I'll say that.
All right, Daddy. We have our drink, we're out on the patio, you have prepared me for it. Rose's cancer has come back, hasn't it?
All right, Daddy. We have our drink, we're out on the patio, you have prepared me for it. Rose's cancer has come back, hasn't it?
No, son, she is dead.
No, son, she is dead.
Dead, Rose is dead? You mean... she died?
Dead, Rose is dead? You mean... she died?
I am afraid so, son. About a week ago. Her husband phoned me, she had asked him to call me if anything happened.
I am afraid so, son. About a week ago. Her husband phoned me, she had asked him to call me if anything happened.
But... but how? She was young! Rose wasn't old!
But... but how? She was young! Rose wasn't old!
She was fifty-six, son. Of course she didn't look it, nowhere near it. The cancer came back, I'm afraid I fibbed about that. But it was very quick, son. She was in the hospital only two weeks, and the last week she didn't know anything.

Excuse me, I'll be right back.
Well, you have knocked me for a hell of a loop, old man. A hell of a loop.
I know. You loved her. So did I. It was an awful shock to me, too. An awful shock. Rose was so alive it's hard to believe.
I know. You loved her. So did I. It was an awful shock to me, too. An awful shock. Rose was so alive it's hard to believe.
I can't believe it, Daddy. I know it must be true, but I can't believe it.
I can't believe it, Daddy. I know it must be true, but I can't believe it.
It's true, son. The girl with the cornflower eyes is dead, she is no more,
Why Rose? Why Rose, Daddy?
Nobody lives forever, boy. Who'd want to?
Nobody lives forever, boy. Who'd want to?
That's a hell of a thing to say. Why, Rose?
That's a hell of a thing to say. Why, Rose?
Now look, boy, get a grip on yourself. Rose had a good life. She found her. Right, didn't she? She triumphed over everything, what are you blubbering about?
Now look, boy, get a grip on yourself. Rose had a good life. She found her. Right, didn't she? She triumphed over everything, what are you blubbering about?
I'm not blubbering.
The point is you don't grow up like that on a diet of sorghum and hominy grits. She got protein somewhere, she's a very strong girl and I think she'll live... despite the delay in medical treatment.
That's all I want to know. Lets get out of here before I get the epizootics myself. Thank you, Doctor, for your discourse, it was fascinating, no doubt.
Well, it's a disaster. I don't know what to say, Doctor, I am floored. How dangerous is the operation?
Any major operation is dangerous. However, as we know from her previous illness, she's a very strong girl.
Any major operation is dangerous. However, as we know from her previous illness, she's a very strong girl.
Well, if it isn't malignant and she can get through the operation all right, it might be better than her really being pregnant. She doesn't even know who the father might have been.
Well, if it isn't malignant and she can get through the operation all right, it might be better than her really being pregnant. She doesn't even know who the father might have been.
Oh, it's definitely better, beyond question. A fatherless child, an ignorant girl with no job, no money, no home. It's fortunate, a blessing really, and a stroke of good luck for another reason I want to mention to you.
Go ahead, Doctor, I think I am following you.
First, about the girl's history. Evidently she's been very promiscuous since early childhood, she has no control over her sexual impulses. Furthermore, she is permanently barren, she can't have children.

Go on, Doctor.
I am ahead of you.
Then... may I speak quite frankly with you, Mr. Hillyer?
Then... may I speak quite frankly with you, Mr. Hillyer?
Please do.
Please do.
I have of course observed the girl in treating her.

Of course.

I think we both know her.

Yes, we know her.
It isn't the fourth dimension. To you it's the fourth dimension, maybe, to me it's simply the truth.
Well, well, well. So Miss Rosebud has arrived. Un-hmm. And you're all assembled here. Yes, indeed. Un hmmm.
Good morning, sweetheart. Beautiful day.
Yes, it's so nice I thought I'd work outside.
Yes, it's so nice I thought I'd work outside.
How goes it, darlin'?
How goes it, darlin'?
Slow, hon. But at least I can concentrate now that Rose is here.

What do you think of her, honey?
Turn up your hearing aid.
What?
What?
Your hearing aid, it's buzzing at me like a snake.
Your hearing aid, it's buzzing at me like a snake.
Oh. Did you say something?
Oh. Did you say something?
I asked you what you think of Rosebud, now that she's been here a while.
I asked you what you think of Rosebud, now that she's been here a while.
Honey, she's perfect. She works all the time and she's wonderful with the children. And they love her, even Brother likes her though he won't admit it. I think she's just perfect.

Um-hmm. Almost too perfect.
Um-hmm. Almost too perfect.
And she's such a good-hearted thing, there isn't an ounce of harm or malice in her.

Well, I'll admit I don't see any flies on her yet.
Well, I'll admit I don't see any flies on her yet.
There are no flies on Rose, I don't know what you're talking about.
There are no flies on Rose, I don't know what you're talking about.
Well, she must have done something to encourage those scoundrels in Birmingham, even if she did run away from them.
Well, let's hope for the best, darlin'.
Hope for the best? I don't understand all this skepticism. I thought you liked Rose.
Hope for the best? I don't understand all this skepticism. I thought you liked Rose.
I love Rosebud, I am wild about Rosebud. I just hope she doesn't turn out to be a hidden hotcha character, that's all. We have growing children in the house.

Hotcha character. If I had to live with your cynicism, I wouldn't want to live at all. What you can't understand is that the creative forces of the universe are positive, not negative.

All right, darlin', don't go off into the fourth dimension.
All right, darlin', don't go off into the fourth dimension.
I'm not in the fourth dimension -- -- you are in the fourth dimension, when you allow skepticism and doubt to take control. As Blake said, if God had doubt the sun would go out.

Be nice to Rose. She's never had a real home.
Be nice to Rose. She's never had a real home.
You're a wonderful woman, darlin'. As long as you're around, I'm sure the sun wouldn't dare go out.
I'll drive you, darlin'. You've got no business behind the wheel of an automobile. You don't think about what you're doing and you'll run into a telephone pole.
I think about what I'm doing all the time, and I've got as much business behind the wheel of an automobile as anybody. Besides, I want you to stay and help Rose with the dishes, the poor girl isn't feeling well.

All right, darlin'.
What's the matter, hon? Is anything wrong?
No, darlin'. Just that damnable insomnia in reverse. I sleep like a baby for an hour then I'm wide awake. You go back to sleep.
Um-hmm. Well, that is the damndest outfit I ever saw in my life. You walk down the street like that and they'll put you in jail, Rose.
Why, they won't either. She looks pretty. And I wish you wouldn't pick on the poor girl all the time. Don't listen to him, Rose, you look pretty, even beautiful.
Lay off of that stuff, son. It upsets your mother.
I'm serious. We forget he's just a child. I wish you'd speak to him.
I'm serious. We forget he's just a child. I wish you'd speak to him.
I'll take him with me downtown. And you, too, Rose, if you want a ride.
They'll put her in jail. The damn little fool might as well be naked.
Well, it is a little tight. But it isn't as bad as all that. No one will notice unless they have such thoughts in the first place.

Who doesn't have such thoughts? We'd better get going.

You're not having lunch?
You're not having lunch?
Just half-a-cup of coffee. I never eat, darlin', you know that. Not eating and reverse insomnia are my curses. Let's go, Rose, you and Brother, let's hit the road.

Rose, you and Brother wait in the car. I want to speak for a moment Lo Mr. Hillyer.
I wish you wouldn't pick on Rose and tease her like that. Of course her clothes are silly, but she's ignorant, naive, she doesn't know any better.
The girl worries me. If she walks down the street like that, an army will be following her.

Well, I admit that outfit isn't very modest. But she doesn't mean any harm, she just wants to attract, attention.

She will succeed.

I don't think you understand her. It isn't sex she wants, it's love she wants and this is the only way she knows how to get it.

That farmer in Gadsden was awful eager to get rid of her, and I'm beginning to see why.

He and his wife both said she had a fine moral character and was wonderful with children.

Well, she loves children, all right. She loves everybody.
Well, she loves children, all right. She loves everybody.
But that's a wonderful quality, not a bad quality. Have a little patience with her. She's such a good-hearted little thing and tries so hard.

Be kind to her. She loves you so much. In a perfectly proper way, of course.

Yes, of course.
Well, she's back.
What time is it?
What time is it?
Quarter of twelve.

Is she all right?

I don't see any bruises or broken bones.
Why shouldn't she go out and have boyfriends?
No reason at all, darlin'.

Well, I wish you'd stop criticizing and picking on her.

Forgive my crudity, darlin'. All I'm saying is that a girl who would wear clothes like that is going to get in trouble sooner or later.

Well, time will tell, won't it?

Yes, darlin', time will tell.
That sulky boy was here again this afternoon. I was almost scared, he wouldn't go away.
Rose, my patience is wearing thin. First a scruffy man who runs like a deer and now a sulky boy who wont go away. This is getting to be a regular monkey and dog show.
Well, it isn't Rose's fault boys and men like her. You cant blame her for that, hon.
Rose, I realize you don't know this boy, but if you know anybody who does know him, if you have even a faint clue as to who he might be, then convey to him that he had better stay away from my house and stop scaring my wife... and I don't mean maybe.
Oh, shut up, Rose. Shut your mouth and quit crying!
I will not sit here and listen to you be brutal to this poor girl.
I will not sit here and listen to you be brutal to this poor girl.
I am not being brutal to her!

You certainly are! She has an awful toothache, look at her jaw, it's all swollen.
You certainly are! She has an awful toothache, look at her jaw, it's all swollen.
Darlin', it is not my fault if the girl has epizootics --
-- I am not responsible for her epizootics and I did not bring about her epizootics. Now listen to me. When I have to get up in the middle of the night and defend my home with a shotgun against a couple of damned scoundrels fistfighting in the bushes --
Scoundrels? They weren't scoundrels, they were just boys.
Scoundrels? They weren't scoundrels, they were just boys.
Boys? You say to me boys?
Boys? You say to me boys?
Yes! Yes, I say that to you, they were boys! Boy friends of Rose, chat's what they were, and why shouldn't she have boy friends? Do you want her to be unnatural? Don't you think she's human the same way you are yourself? It's the South, that's what it is, the South with its horrible traditions, of slavery and crime and the oppression of

Now darlin', what has the South got to do with this?
Now darlin', what has the South got to do with this?
And when I try to talk to you seriously, when I try to explain to you the unlimited creative power of life, how beautiful it would be if we gave up this hopeless struggle and simply loved each other from our hearts, what do you do -- you mock me!
And when I try to talk to you seriously, when I try to explain to you the unlimited creative power of life, how beautiful it would be if we gave up this hopeless struggle and simply loved each other from our hearts, what do you do -- you mock me!
I don't intend to mock you, dear. I respect your philosophy. It's beyond my comprehension, but I respect it.
Now you listen to me, Rose --
Just a moment! You are not going to fire this girl for an innocent thing like having boy friends, not while there is breath in my body!
Just a moment! You are not going to fire this girl for an innocent thing like having boy friends, not while there is breath in my body!
I don't intend to fire her, darlin'.
I don't intend to fire her, darlin'.
It isn't her fault if she's popular... what?
It isn't her fault if she's popular... what?
I said I don't intend to fire her. I just want to ask her to keep her boy friends away from my home and hearth, that's all.
I said I don't intend to fire her. I just want to ask her to keep her boy friends away from my home and hearth, that's all.
Well, that's very reasonable. Howe I hate to bring it up, but she's got an awful toothache, we've got to carry her to the dentist.
I'm sorry, darlin', I hate it as much as you do.
Well, she does seem to cause a lot of trouble, I admit. But she doesn't mean any harm and it'll break the children's hearts, they all love her.
Well, she does seem to cause a lot of trouble, I admit. But she doesn't mean any harm and it'll break the children's hearts, they all love her.
It's because of the children she's got to go. I don't want to be holier-than-thou, but the girl doesn't have the same outlook we do. Morals don't mean a thing to her, not a thing, and we can't have a girl like that in this house.

Who is to say our morals are better than hers? But maybe you're right. She could... influence Dolly...

That is exactly what I'm afraid of. The girl has got to go, darlin'.
That is exactly what I'm afraid of. The girl has got to go, darlin'.
But morals come from the heart, not from rigid rules and empty laws. And in her heart Rose has never hurt anyone and she never would. Therefore, she's not immoral. Not really.

Now look, darlin', this is no time to go off into the fourth dimension.
Now look, darlin', this is no time to go off into the fourth dimension.
But what I said is the simple truth. And now I see something else, I see more deeply into it...
How could Rose really be a bad influence on Dolly? She has a loving nature, you ought to want someone like that around your children. Why do you think those boys and men like her?
Well, I have a pretty good idea.
Well, I have a pretty good idea.
If you mean sex, you couldn't be more wrong. Rose likes those boys and men, she has love in her heart, and that is what they want. It's the most rare and beautiful thing in life and that is why they follow her.

They follow her because she's a -- -- no, I won't say that.
They follow her because she's a -- -- no, I won't say that.
What she doesn't understand is that her behavior is disturbing to other people. She's young, she's got to learn to restrain the life force that's in her. Its creative, but in her case it's too creative.

Darlin', Rose has got to go!
Darlin', Rose has got to go!
I'll talk to her, I'll reason with her.
Excuse me, sir, are you calling my wife a liar?
Honey, please...
I can't stand that polecat. They ought to hang him.
You don't like him because he's a Yankee. He's a brilliant doctor.
You don't like him because he's a Yankee. He's a brilliant doctor.
He's a polecat, dear.
Rosebud looked pretty pitiful in that bed. I hope she'll be all right, but I still think we ought to fire her.
I don't see how you can even think of it now.
Honey, Dr. Martinson isn't a rascal, he's one of the finest physicians in Glenville. He studied at Johns Hopkins University.
I don't care where the polecat studied.
I don't care where the polecat studied.
Sometimes the negativism and cynicism in you makes me want to vomit. Your real trouble is that you're anti-intellectual. The irony is women are supposed to be emotional, but I never saw anybody who depended more on emotion and prejudice than you do.
She's like a different person. Being so sick made a big impression on her. I really think she's learned a lesson.
Um-hmm. Come with me, Brother. I want to show you something.
She hasn't actually done anything...
Just a moment, dear. We can't have it, Rose. Can you behave yourself -- or not? That is the question, to behave or not to behave, to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous chastity and keep your skirt down or to hoist it in the light of the moon and make whoopee -- that is the coil shuffling question. If you can't behave
It has been three weeks since I "fired" her. Is there no way to get rid of this girl? Are we stuck with her for life?
She can't get a job, it's a depression. And we can't just throw her out on the street.
She can't get a job, it's a depression. And we can't just throw her out on the street.
The hell we can't.
She does look a little peaky.
No, she doesn't, she's fine, fine. She's perfectly healthy, don't give her ideas.
Her plan is obvious, plain as day. She's going on a hunger strike. The question is, how do we foil her?
She's just nervous and worried. And you would be, too, if you had no job and no place to go.
She's just nervous and worried. And you would be, too, if you had no job and no place to go.
Something has got to be done or Rose is going to be in this house forever.
Honey, Rose was born on a farm and has terrible memories of farm life. Now I don't think --
Just a minute, Rose, you don't understand. This isn't a dirt farm like the one you were born on, it's nice. A neighbor of Cousin Hop's, I talked to him on the phone, a fine man... it's not a farm, damn it, it's a beautiful dairy establishment! Stop crying, Rose! Do you hear me? Stop crying, it's ideal!

I don't know how you can call it ideal -- don't you know what the word "farm" means to her?
I don't know how you can call it ideal -- don't you know what the word "farm" means to her?
I don't give a hoot in hell's hollow what it means to her! She can't stay in this house forever! I fired her, damn it!
I don't give a hoot in hell's hollow what it means to her! She can't stay in this house forever! I fired her, damn it!
It sounds like a farm to me. Calling it a dairy establishment, that's just trickery and flummery.
It sounds like a farm to me. Calling it a dairy establishment, that's just trickery and flummery.
Trickery and flummery or not, she's going there tomorrow on the bus! It's settled! And I must say we've been more than fair to you, Rose, it's pretty selfish and mean hearted of you to sit there and cry like that!
This is a total catastrastroke. As of this moment I am stumped, I admit, I am stumped and treed both, the hound dogs have me surrounded.
Poor thing, don't cry, Rose. I know you feel awful, but don't cry, honey, nobody's perfect. Who's the father, dear?
You're not going to get anywhere with that line of questioning. The problem is, what are we going to do?
That's why I'm asking her who the father is. It's the most vital question of all. Who's the father, dear?
That's why I'm asking her who the father is. It's the most vital question of all. Who's the father, dear?
She already told you, she doesn't know.
She already told you, she doesn't know.
But she must know... unless... unless... Rose, was there more than one person?
Ah, ha! Hold the phone! No forwarding address, huh? In the shock of this brilliant move, I forgot something.
What did you forget?
What did you forget?
I forgot that Rose will lie like a child. She's no more pregnant than I am, she just doesn't want to go to that farm!
Honey!
She doesn't have to take her panties off, we can see her stomach with 'em on. All she has to do is pull up her dress and let us see her belly.
I'd say about three months. Are you satisfied?
I am poleaxed and in a non compos mentis condition. I wash my hands or the whole thing.
This conversation is making me a little sick.
Honey, that's no way to talk to the Doctor, he's merely doing his job, dear.
Reluctantly, I do. It would be a blessing to her and everyone else. The girl is oversexed and I say -- spay her!
Over... my... dead... body!
I thought I knew you. I thought I knew you better, I thought in your heart you were a good and kind man. Well, I can't believe what I've just heard in this room. A defenseless girl depending on you for protection, and you propose to mutilate and destroy her. How could you listen even for a moment to that sadistic man?
Well, now, darlin'... give me a chance to defend myself.
Well, now, darlin'... give me a chance to defend myself.
I can't believe you really meant it, if I did I'd want to die. You aren't a male monster, that man is but you aren't. Look me in the eye and tell me, do you really want to take Rose's womanhood away from her when it's all she has got?

Well, I... I hadn't thought about it that much. I was thinking... well, it's an idea, the girl is oversexed, and...
Well, I... I hadn't thought about it that much. I was thinking... well, it's an idea, the girl is oversexed, and...
Rose isn't oversexed, that's ridiculous. If you're going to talk nonsense, I don't want to talk to you at all. Rose is exactly the same as the rest of us, except more so.
Rose isn't oversexed, that's ridiculous. If you're going to talk nonsense, I don't want to talk to you at all. Rose is exactly the same as the rest of us, except more so.
Well, I know, more so. That's why I was thinking... maybe she'd be better off.
Well, I know, more so. That's why I was thinking... maybe she'd be better off.
Better off? How could she ever find love and happiness, if you did what you're talking about? Are you insane?
How is she?
Fine.
It's twenty after one.
I don't understand it. Even in the wild days she was never as late as this.
I don't understand it. Even in the wild days she was never as late as this.
I'm afraid it's my fault. I made her feel guilty this morning -- Brother, what are you doing up?
Why, that looks like Dave Wilkie,
Who?
Who?
You know Dave, his wife used to do dressmaking for you before she died.
Well, thank God we are rid of her at last. And the best thing of all is that she's happy. The little nut is happy, she found Mr. Right in the nick of time!
Well, yes, she's happy. Of course Dave doesn't have her life force, not at all. There isn't much furniture in his house, just a table and one or two chairs, whereas Rose has furniture coming out of the windows.
Well, yes, she's happy. Of course Dave doesn't have her life force, not at all. There isn't much furniture in his house, just a table and one or two chairs, whereas Rose has furniture coming out of the windows.
Honey, he is Mr. Right.
Honey, he is Mr. Right.
Yes, I think so. He adores her, it's almost pitiful the way he worships her. I just hope she isn't too much for him.
Yes, sir.
All right. Now as head of this household I have a couple of remarks to make. It is my dear wife's belief, which I accept although I do not totally grasp it, that to hire a person to do household work is a criminal practice. Therefore, you are here not as a servant, you are here as a friend, as a guest and hopefully

Yes, sir.
Rosebaby Blossom, these are the most delicious candied yams I ever ate! Why, they just melt in my mouth. And this fried chicken is fit for a king. How do you do it, Peachbird? What is the secret of your art, Plum Blossom, huh?
Oh, I don't know, I... I...
Oh, I don't know, I... I...
Rosebird Baby, you are the light of my life, darlin'. How did we ever get by without you?
Rosebird Baby, you are the light of my life, darlin'. How did we ever get by without you?
I... I'll get the grits.
Ahh-hem! Now, Rose, get off my lap. What are you doing, girl? Are you crazy?
Yes, crazy about you! Kiss me, Mr. Hillyer!
Yes, crazy about you! Kiss me, Mr. Hillyer!
Why, I'm not going to kiss you, you crazy girl. Now I'm telling you again, get off my lap. Come on, Rose, get up. Now you get up, I say, and stop this!
Why, I'm not going to kiss you, you crazy girl. Now I'm telling you again, get off my lap. Come on, Rose, get up. Now you get up, I say, and stop this!
No, no! You don't understand, I love you! It's real love and I can't help it! Please kiss me, Mr. Hillyer, I love you, I love you so much...
All right, all right. Now calm down, Rose, the children will hear you. Calm down, let's talk... about this thing, let's discuss it.
Don't make me... me... me... get up!
Don't make me... me... me... get up!
Calm down, Rose, let's calm down and discuss it ...
Goddamn you, girl! You've made me make a fool out of myself, damn your hide, but let me tell you I am standing at the pass of Thermopylae and I won't budge! The very idea, my own home with children in the house, to say nothing of my wife -- oh-h, you had better believe I am standing at Thermopylae, you little nut, you
Oh-h, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Mr. Hillyer... I just... couldn't help myself. I'm sorry...
Rose, Rose, Rose, you poor miserable little child, don't you know I love you? Do I have to put my hand on your body or kiss your pretty lips to prove it? You are beautiful to me, Rose, I've loved you since you first came here, darlin'. And don't you know Mrs. Hillyer loves you, too, that she's already taken you into her heart,
Oh, I know. She's so sweet, she's been so good to me...
Oh, I know. She's so sweet, she's been so good to me...
Do you know what a friend you have got there? Do you know she would fight for you like a tiger, that she would fly to your defense in an instant with all the courage in her soul if anyone tried to hurt you? Is this any way to repay her trust and love? Are you ashamed as I am ashamed? Don't cry, honey,
Rose, what are you doing up?
Nothin', just goin' to the bathroom.
Nothin', just goin' to the bathroom.
Is anything wrong?
Is anything wrong?
No, sir.
No, sir.
Well, good night.
Nothin'. I got myself up, that's all.
Got yourself up?
Got yourself up?
Yeah. I'm goin' out.
You're so sweet.
If you've got time before you go "out," get me a half-a-cup of coffee, Rose. Not a whole cup, a half-a-cup.
If you've got time before you go "out," get me a half-a-cup of coffee, Rose. Not a whole cup, a half-a-cup.
Why, sure, always got time to get you a half-a-cup, and one of these days I'm gonna get you a whole cup and see what happens.
Why, sure, always got time to get you a half-a-cup, and one of these days I'm gonna get you a whole cup and see what happens.
Um-hmmuhh. I never drink a whole cup, my nerves can't stand the caffeine. Ehh-hh, Lord awful insomnia in reverse last night. Lay there and sweated blood for hours.
That's a pretty stylish skirt, Rose. The only thing I don't understand is how did you ever get it on.
Well, it has buttons.
How can the buttons stand the pressure?
There are more on the other side.
What have you got in your hair, girl?
My rose. It's kind of like a motto. People will say, there comes Rose with her rose.
You were up late last night, too, Rose.
Yes, sir. I had to go to the bathroom.
Where do you want me to let you out, Rose?
Oh, anywhere downtown.
Oh, anywhere downtown.
You don't know where you're going?
You don't know where you're going?
Oh, I'll just mosey around here and there.
Is this ill right?
It'll do just fine. Bye-bye, see you later.
Well, Rose, my sleep was a little disturbed last night, and so was Mrs. Hillyer's, and so was the children's. How about you? Was your sleep disturbed, too?
Yes, Mr. Hillyer, it was. I... I heard strange voices in the night.
Yes, Mr. Hillyer, it was. I... I heard strange voices in the night.
Strange voices, Rose?
Strange voices, Rose?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Now Rose, stop behaving as if you're Bo Peep. Those men had a flight last night because of some female in this house, and it wasn't Dolly or Mrs. Hillyer.
Ohhh-hh, ohhh...
Oh, shut up, Rose, eat your cornflakes!
Oh, shut up, Rose, eat your cornflakes!
I'm not hungry.
Darlin', I'll take a taxi to the hotel. You and Brother can handle the girl's epizootics. I'll just say one more thing. Rose, I told you you had a friend in Mrs. Hillyer, didn't I, that she would fight for you like a tiger?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
All right, thanks to her, and thanks to this case of epizootics, you are getting another chance. But don't try my patience again. We have growing children in this house. Do you understand me?
All right, thanks to her, and thanks to this case of epizootics, you are getting another chance. But don't try my patience again. We have growing children in this house. Do you understand me?
Yes, sir.
Good morning, Rose. And how do you feel today?
Wonderful. Except I can touch the place back there with my tongue, I wouldn't even know I had that tooth pulled.
Wonderful. Except I can touch the place back there with my tongue, I wouldn't even know I had that tooth pulled.
Well, I know it, I just got the bill for it.
Well, I know it, I just got the bill for it.
Boy, for four or five days there I didn't think I'd live. But I'm my old self again!
Boy, for four or five days there I didn't think I'd live. But I'm my old self again!
Umm. Well. Yes. But no more strange voices in the night, Rose.
Umm. Well. Yes. But no more strange voices in the night, Rose.
Oh, no, sir.
I got an awful bad cold.
That's all you've got to say, you've got a bad cold?
That's all you've got to say, you've got a bad cold?
Well, I don't know what happened. They were arguin' about baseball, then all of 'em started fightin'. As for that policeman, I didn't bite him, I don't think I bit him.
I didn't mean to bite him. He was hitting Horton with a blackjack in the meanest way and... and I bit him accidental.
I have to go back to the hotel. I'm on duty at the desk and who knows a quest might arrive. I will see you at suppertime, Rose.
I have to go back to the hotel. I'm on duty at the desk and who knows a quest might arrive. I will see you at suppertime, Rose.
I didn't mean to bite him, I really didn't.
I didn't mean to bite him, I really didn't.
I will see you at suppertime, Rose.
I will see you at suppertime, Rose.
Yes, air.
I mean a human investment, Rose, we care about you, you matter to us. But we have innocent and unformed children in this house and the monkey and dog show has got to stop. Do you hear me?
Yes, sir.
There ain't nobody here, Mr. Hillyer! Honest, there ain't!
Where is he? Where have you got him hid? Ah, ha!
And who, Rose, may I ask, is that?
Well, it's Billy.
Well, it's Billy.
And what, may I ask, was Billy doing here?
And what, may I ask, was Billy doing here?
Well, Mr. Hillyer, Billy's very poor, he don't have no money and there wasn't no place else to go.
Well, Mr. Hillyer, Billy's very poor, he don't have no money and there wasn't no place else to go.
Well, it was a silly question.
Well, it was a silly question.
He's a nice boy, you'd like him. He wants to be a fireman.
He's a nice boy, you'd like him. He wants to be a fireman.
Ye gods and little fishes, a fireman. Put on some clothes, Rose, you're naked as a jay bird. When you're dressed, come on downstairs. I'm afraid your friend Billy is injured, where are his clothes?
Ye gods and little fishes, a fireman. Put on some clothes, Rose, you're naked as a jay bird. When you're dressed, come on downstairs. I'm afraid your friend Billy is injured, where are his clothes?
Under the mattress. I hid 'em so you wouldn't be mad. He wants to marry me, he loves me. I can't marry him, he's too young and hasn't got no job, but he loves me... now you wouldn't hurt him, would you?
Mr. Hillyer, I know it was bad and I hadn't ought to of done it. But I'm only a human girl and I... I ain't always perfect. I promise I won't let him in the house no more, I promise. Won't you and Mrs. Hillyer forgive me?
Rose, darlin', you break my heart. But I am only a human man myself of the father variety. Rose, pack your bag, baby, as of this moment you are hired, mired and fired.
Well, Rose, going out to look for a job today?
What's the use, there ain't none.
What's the use, there ain't none.
Mmm. Would you get me another half a-cup of coffee, dear?
God forbid. You're not sick, Rose, forget it. Don't get any notions in your head, you're not sick.
Yes, sir.
Well, I have got news! I called long distance and spoke to Cousin Hop and you'll be glad to know, Rose, I have found you a job!
Tennessee?
Tennessee?
Yes, Tennessee, a lovely state!
Yes, Tennessee, a lovely state!
Well. What kinda job is it?
Well. What kinda job is it?
Ahh-hh, you'll like it. It's a fine, outdoor-type job.
Ahh-hh, you'll like it. It's a fine, outdoor-type job.
You mean a farm?
You mean a farm?
No, no, not exactly. It isn't a farm in the sense that it's a farm. Not at all. It's a... dairy establishment. You'll 1ike it! I'm sure you'll like it because it's so... peaceful!
I'm not cryin' because of me, I'm cryin' because of somebody else.
What?
What baby? What baby? What baby are you speaking about?
Mine.
Mine.
Your baby?
Your baby?
Yes, mine. I'm going to have one.
Yes, mine. I'm going to have one.
Good God almighty. This is a catastrophe, they won't hire her.
Yes, I am.
No, you're not.
No, you're not.
Yes, Mr. Hillyer, I am.
Yes, Mr. Hillyer, I am.
All right, tell us, Rose, what makes you think you're pregnant?
All right, tell us, Rose, what makes you think you're pregnant?
I haven't had my period for three months and my stomach is getting big.
I haven't had my period for three months and my stomach is getting big.
I don't believe it.
I don't believe it.
It's so, Mr. Hillyer.
It's so, Mr. Hillyer.
All right, damn it. We've seen you with your clothes off around here, stand up and pull up your dress and let's take a look!
You're looking very chipper this morning, Rose. Sow do you feel?
Perfect, wonderful, good as I ever felt! Except for a big old scar on my stummick, I wouldn't even know I been in the hospital.
Perfect, wonderful, good as I ever felt! Except for a big old scar on my stummick, I wouldn't even know I been in the hospital.
Well, we know you were there. The bill that hospital sent was absolutely horrendous.
Well, we know you were there. The bill that hospital sent was absolutely horrendous.
Well, I'll pay you that back sometime, Mr. Hillyer.
Rose... I hate to be mean, but... Oh, nevermind, forget it.
What was it, Mr. Hillyer?
What was it, Mr. Hillyer?
Nothing, Rose.
Excuse me... your voice is familiar and I'm sure I know you from somewhere...
Awww-rr, Buddy, come on, you know me!
Awww-rr, Buddy, come on, you know me!
Well, I... I... ah-h, let's see...
Well, I... I... ah-h, let's see...
It's Dave Wilkie! I'm Dave Wilkie, don't you remember me?
It's Dave Wilkie! I'm Dave Wilkie, don't you remember me?
Oh. Oh, God. Of course, Dave, how are you?
Well, I am in the construction business, Buddy, and without braggin' I have done real good at it. There are those who wouldn't have expected that out of me. Right now I'm buildin' a giant motel unit near Alexandria, outside Washington, D.C. Not fi-nance, I'm on the construction side.
Well, that's interesting, Dave. I always liked Washington, it's a pretty town.
Well, that's interesting, Dave. I always liked Washington, it's a pretty town.
Oh, it's all right, beats Jew York. But the niggers have took it over, just like every other city we got, only worse.
Ha ha, course you make a lot more. What's that you got there, Buddy?
Galley proof.
Galley proof.
Galley what?
Galley what?
Page proof of a book I'm working on.
Page proof of a book I'm working on.
How about that. Well, you always were a screwball.
How about that. Well, you always were a screwball.
Oh, yeah?
Oh, yeah?
I don't mean that the way it sounds. Imagine it, a book. And I used to know you personal way back when. Tell me something, Buddy, how do you dream up all that stuff?
I don't mean that the way it sounds. Imagine it, a book. And I used to know you personal way back when. Tell me something, Buddy, how do you dream up all that stuff?
Well, actually, we have a little black boy named Her---t who lives in the garage. He does it for me.
Well, actually, we have a little black boy named Her---t who lives in the garage. He does it for me.
Heh heh heh heh, same old Buddy, always jokin' around. Almost as much of a joker as your Daddy. I saw your Daddy a coupla years ago, I was up in Glenville lookin' at a motel site. I guess that's where you're headed, huh, to see him?

That's right, Dave, I'm headed for Glenville on a whisperin' jet.
That's right, Dave, I'm headed for Glenville on a whisperin' jet.
Hey, girl! Hey, you, give us another drink! Dumb little bitch, supposed to give us two in the first place.
Took your time gettin' here.
She has other things to do, Dave.
Tell me about that job in Alexandria, Dave, the big motel you're building.
Near Alexandria. It isn't in Alexandria, it is outside it.
Near Alexandria. It isn't in Alexandria, it is outside it.
I see. Outside it.
I see. Outside it.
That's correct -- outside it, not in it. As for the job, well, the Jewboy suppliers give me a lot of grief and we use a pile of niggers to haul and tote and they ain't worth a sorry-ass damn. But I can build anything, Buddy. Give me the plans and I can build a goddamn staircase to the moon. It's a fact, I
Um-m, well...
Doubted my ability all along, the little bitch. I never remarried, Buddy, you know that, don't you?
Doubted my ability all along, the little bitch. I never remarried, Buddy, you know that, don't you?
Well, no, I didn't actually.
Well, no, I didn't actually.
She's te reason -- cured me of women once and for all. Oh, I got rid of her, Buddy, I didn't waste no time kickin' that bitch out. Hell, she was screwin' everybody in Savannah. I caught her in a motel with this long tall son of a bitch and boy did I beat the everlastin' piss out of him!
She didn't marry him, though, later she married another guy and went to Winston-Salem. It didn't last That girl couldn't have no lastin' marriage, she left him and married another dumb sucker and went out west. Little bitch left him, too, and you know what she's married to right now? A kike. That's right, some kind of kike horse doctor named Schapiro out in
Dave, you are as full of shit as a Christmas turkey and you know it. Now if you want to start a fight on this plane and get yourself in jail, go right ahead. But I am telling you, you are full of shit right up to your eyeballs.
Dave, you are as full of shit as a Christmas turkey and you know it. Now if you want to start a fight on this plane and get yourself in jail, go right ahead. But I am telling you, you are full of shit right up to your eyeballs.
I don't want to start no fight with you, Buddy. Why do you say I'm full of shit?
I don't want to start no fight with you, Buddy. Why do you say I'm full of shit?
Dave Schapiro is no horse doctor and Rose has been a good wife to him for a long time. To call her a nymphomaniac is the most stupid thing I ever heard in my life.
Dave Schapiro is no horse doctor and Rose has been a good wife to him for a long time. To call her a nymphomaniac is the most stupid thing I ever heard in my life.
You loved her, didn't you. Well, so did I. You'll have to admit she had four husbands.
You loved her, didn't you. Well, so did I. You'll have to admit she had four husbands.
Yeah, it took her a while to grow up and find Mr. Right, but she did it. She found him.
Yeah, it took her a while to grow up and find Mr. Right, but she did it. She found him.
She used to call me Mr. Right. Remember that, Buddy?
She used to call me Mr. Right. Remember that, Buddy?
Yeah, I remember it.
Well, got to get a plane to Savannah. Great running into you, Buddy. Give my best to your Daddy.
Yeah, I'll do that, Dave.
Yeah, I'll do that, Dave.
Ah-h, if you happen to run into Rose sometime... do me a favor, give her a message for me, will you?
Ah-h, if you happen to run into Rose sometime... do me a favor, give her a message for me, will you?
Dave, I haven't seen Rose for years.
You might see her. She writes your Daddy, and she and that doctor came to see him, didn't they? I wish you'd tell her something... I never could write letters.
What do you want me to tell her, Dave?
What do you want me to tell her, Dave?
Oh, to hell with it, never mind. Don't tell her anything. Don't even tell her you saw me. Got to run, Buddy, I'll miss my plane.
I don't like that, either, it's worse than Waski. I want to be called Fran.
Daddy wouldn't hear that. Now the redhaired boy you see sitting there, of course you have met him, he is my oldest son and my most brilliant child. All children have great creative powers, but I don't want to rattle on about my children, they say I brag too much about them, especially about Brother. Am I boring you, Rose?
Yes, dear, what is it?
Mother, Buddy says Rose got in his bed last night and he fiddled with her and she snorted and had a fit -- and he says I would too if I was grown-up. Is it true, Mother -- would I sweat and snort and froth at the mouth and have a horrible fit like he says?
Daddy, Buddy was up late last night reading little dirty comic books. Mother gave him a dose of castor oil and he cursed it, he took the Lords name in vain, then claimed he hadn't said it. He lied, Daddy.
You mustn't be a tattletale, dear. You mustn't be Delilah-ish and Jezebel-ish toward your brother, dear.
You mustn't be a tattletale, dear. You mustn't be Delilah-ish and Jezebel-ish toward your brother, dear.
I'm only trying to help him, Mother.
What's the matter with him?
I don't know. I think he's cryin'!
Well, Mrs. Hillyer, the girl is strong as an ox and that is what is keeping her alive. But not many people walk away from double pneumonia, Madam, not many.
She looks terrible, just awful.
She looks terrible, just awful.
Of course she does and I must say I'm puzzled by your delay in getting her to the hospital. I should think ordinary powers of observation would have suggested to you that she was seriously ill.
Of course she does and I must say I'm puzzled by your delay in getting her to the hospital. I should think ordinary powers of observation would have suggested to you that she was seriously ill.
She hid it from us, Doctor. She's afraid of the hospital.
She hid it from us, Doctor. She's afraid of the hospital.
Afraid of the hospital?
Afraid of the hospital?
Deathly afraid of it. Her people were poor tenant farmers and she doesn't know anything about doctors or medicine or hospitals.
Deathly afraid of it. Her people were poor tenant farmers and she doesn't know anything about doctors or medicine or hospitals.
A tenant farm? Are you trying to tell me that girl is a product of the hookworm and pellagra belt?
A tenant farm? Are you trying to tell me that girl is a product of the hookworm and pellagra belt?
Well, her people were very poor. She says she was often hungry as a child, and I'm sure the food she ate was pretty awful, not a balanced diet at all.
Well, her people were very poor. She says she was often hungry as a child, and I'm sure the food she ate was pretty awful, not a balanced diet at all.
Exactly, and that's why she couldn't possibly have come from such a farm.
It's simply that I find it incredible, Mr. Hillyer. Aside from the girl's illness at the moment, she is very strong, a very healthy specimen of a young human female -- and a comely one, too. She must have gotten protein somewhere as a young child, if only sporadically.
It is kind of amazing. The dentist says she has perfect teeth, there isn't a cavity in her mouth.
Yes, thank you, Doctor.
I beg your pardon, epi-zoo-tics? Do you mean "epi-zoo-ot-tics," an animal epidemic?
Oh, good evening, Doctor. Rose is a lot better, I just gave her her supper. She's almost all well now.
Let me be the judge of that, Madam.
Let me be the judge of that, Madam.
Yes. Well. She's upstairs.
I'm not surprised you thought she was pregnant. An ovarian cyst can look very much like pregnancy. But it was pure wishful thinking on her part. The girl can never have children, she had gonorrhea at fifteen and it was untreated.
Gonorrhea?
Gonorrhea?
Don't worry, Madam, she can't infect your dear little kiddies. She long ago fully recovered, but the disease did irreparable damage. The girl is permanently barren.
Don't worry, Madam, she can't infect your dear little kiddies. She long ago fully recovered, but the disease did irreparable damage. The girl is permanently barren.
Well, that's pathetic. Poor Rose, what a life she has had.
Well, that's pathetic. Poor Rose, what a life she has had.
We make our own lives, Madam. As for malignancy, I don't think so, it's very unlikely. I probably shouldn't have even mentioned that possibility to her.
We make our own lives, Madam. As for malignancy, I don't think so, it's very unlikely. I probably shouldn't have even mentioned that possibility to her.
No, you shouldn't have, it was needlessly cruel. She thinks she has cancer and is going to die.
No, you shouldn't have, it was needlessly cruel. She thinks she has cancer and is going to die.
She's an adult, Mrs. Hillyer, I was merely giving her the facts.
I'm sorry the truth nauseates you, Mrs. Hillyer, because before you leave there's a bit more of it I'd like to put to you. This operation provides a therapeutic opportunity that I feel is quite important in regard to this particular girl, who suffers not only from an ovarian cyst but from a certain psychoneurotic condition as well.
What do you mean, what kind of gobbledygook talk is that?
Yes, go on.
I am thinking particularly of the other ovary. As a rule I don't believe in removing it. The woman's hormonal system is profoundly disturbed, she is subject to possibly serious depression, she loses many of her secondary sexual characteristics for example, her breasts might shrink and become flabby, facial hair might appear along with a coarsening of the features, and of course her sexual
What are you talking about? I don't understand all this mumbo jumbo and the funny looks on your faces.
Mrs. Hillyer, this girl is sick in more ways than one. She is an extreme psychoneurotic with uncontrollable sexual impulses. It would be a mercy to spare her the suffering she causes herself and others. Therefore I recommend as a therapeutic measure the removal of her second ovary. It is ethically and medically the only proper decision in this case and I suspect your
Are you human beings or are you some kind of male monsters? Is there no limit to which you won't go to keep your illusions about yourselves?
Illusions, Madam?
Illusions, Madam?
You'd go so far as to mutilate a helpless girl who has no means to defend herself, you'd go that far? Don't you think I know what you've just said and don't you think I understand the dreadful and revolting crime you've just conspired to commit?
I will not cry like a woman. If I'm upset it's because of what my husband said, not because of you. You can't make me cry like a woman, a woman has got just as much intelligence and self-control as a man. And you get this in your head. If you hurt that girl, I'll hire lawyers and sue you for malpractice for every
Yes, I understand you, but you have misunderstood me completely.
Yes, I understand you, but you have misunderstood me completely.
I understand you perfectly. You leave that girl alone, you wretched man, or you will be sorry.
I understand you perfectly. You leave that girl alone, you wretched man, or you will be sorry.
Actually of course I won't operate, I don't do major surgery. Dr. Hardy will operate and of course he'll be guided by your wishes in this respect.
Actually of course I won't operate, I don't do major surgery. Dr. Hardy will operate and of course he'll be guided by your wishes in this respect.
Let him be guided not by my wishes and not by Rose's wishes, although I am sure they are identical. Let him be guided by the wishes of the creative power of life itself, because that is what has spoken through me tonight.
Well, she finally let me look in her mouth. Is it true she's never been to a dentist?
She was raised on a poor dirt farm. I'm sure she's never seen a dentist or hardly even a doctor.
She was raised on a poor dirt farm. I'm sure she's never seen a dentist or hardly even a doctor.
Well, she has one mouth in ten thousand, I don't see teeth like that once in ten years. Her trouble is an impacted wisdom tooth, but there isn't a cavity in her head, not a single one. She has perfect teeth.
Well, she has one mouth in ten thousand, I don't see teeth like that once in ten years. Her trouble is an impacted wisdom tooth, but there isn't a cavity in her head, not a single one. She has perfect teeth.
But the wisdom tooth will have to be pulled?
But the wisdom tooth will have to be pulled?
Yes, and it's very bad. It probably should be done at the hospital under general anesthesia.
Yes, and it's very bad. It probably should be done at the hospital under general anesthesia.
That would scare her to death. She's terrified of hospitals. To her, a hospital is where you go to die.
That would scare her to death. She's terrified of hospitals. To her, a hospital is where you go to die.
I think you're right, it would be harder on her. But you'd better call Mr. Hillyer, she's going to need help to get home.
Rose, this is Waski. His real name is Warren but we call him Waski. He doesn't like it much and I suppose someday we'll have to stop calling him that.
You can stop it right now.
You can stop it right now.
When he was baby we called him "Wa Wa," a baby name, you know. You will find him a very good boy. His brother can be bad and so can his sister, but Waski is a very good boy. And as you can see he's beautiful.

Oh, Mother, cut it out.
Oh, Mother, cut it out.
There are plenty of girls who would give thousands of dollars to have your auburn hair. Beauty is beauty and that's all there is to it. Beauty is there and we have to recognize it. Now Rose, the little girl sitting across from you with the blue eyes is Doll Baby. She looks like an angel and she is an angel, but she can
Mother... is Rose going to die?
No, Waski, she won't die, because we are praying for her.
Oh, no, ma'am.
Well, it's rather interesting about Brother, actually. I realized the remarkable thing he had when he was six weeks old. He looked at me and understood me, he knew exactly who I was. I know it sounds crazy but it's true. He's very remarkable, he was born for the ministry and could move millions, but he doesn't know that yet. I have to warn
What are you studying now, Mrs. Hillyer?
More history, Rose.
More history, Rose.
Are you going to get your degree soon?
Are you going to get your degree soon?
Well, I am working on my thesis.
Well, I am working on my thesis.
It must be wonderful to be so smart. I don't see how you do it, reading all those books, learning all that stuff.
It must be wonderful to be so smart. I don't see how you do it, reading all those books, learning all that stuff.
Rose, you work too hard. Why don't you go sit down somewhere and drink a Co-Cola?
Rose, you work too hard. Why don't you go sit down somewhere and drink a Co-Cola?
You're so sweet.
Really, why don't you go sit down somewhere?
I like to work. I don't mind work. It's the least I can do after all you and Mr. Hillyer have done for me. You're so sweet. There never was nobody like you.
I like to work. I don't mind work. It's the least I can do after all you and Mr. Hillyer have done for me. You're so sweet. There never was nobody like you.
Well, you run on now.
Well, you run on now.
Yes, Ma'am.
Rose, you're in an awful dither tonight. What's the matter with you, honey, are you sick or something?
No, ma'am, I'm just fine.
No, ma'am, I'm just fine.
You look sick if you ask me. I hate to leave you with the dishes and all, but I'm supposed to go to a meeting of the Garden Club this evening. I'll need the car keys.
Well, I think it's charming, Rose. But don't you think... ah, the skirt is a little tight?
Oh, no, that's the style. It's meant to be clinging.
Yes, Ma'am.
Doll, you and Waski run on, too.
Rose, that scruffy-looking man is out in the yard again.
Mrs. Hillyer, I don't know who he is, I really don't.
Mrs. Hillyer, I don't know who he is, I really don't.
I had better call Daddy.
I don't think we ought to discuss this in front of the children.
Oh... oh... oh! I think... maybe... one of 'em... was Foster... but I don't hardly know him!
I don't want to go to the dentist.
Be quiet, Rose.
Poor thing. Does the ice help, Rose?
Ohh-hh, a little. Oh-h, I ain't never been to no dentist before. He's gonna kill me, I just know it.
Ohh-hh, a little. Oh-h, I ain't never been to no dentist before. He's gonna kill me, I just know it.
No, Rose, he'll help you.
I'm not goin' in there, I don't like the looks of it!
Rose, sit down in that chair and be quiet! We're trying to help you, you silly creature, sit in that chair!
Rose, sit down in that chair and be quiet! We're trying to help you, you silly creature, sit in that chair!
Oh-hh, ohh-hh, Lord, he's gonna kill me.
Never again, never again...
I know it was bad, honey. I'm sorry...
I know it was bad, honey. I'm sorry...
No more dentists, no more dentists...
No more dentists, no more dentists...
It'll get better now.
Rose has learned her lesson, haven't you, Rose?
Yes, ma'am.
Rose, you're very sick. You're burning up. Rose, can you hear me? Rose?
What? Wha-at? Mrs. Hillyer?
You see, Rose? Now that's the kind of dress you ought to wear.
Yeah, it's kinda nice.
Yeah, it's kinda nice.
You look very pretty in it, Rose. Really, you do.
You look very pretty in it, Rose. Really, you do.
Well, you're real sweet to make it for me. There never was nobody like you. And you don't need to worry, I ain't goin' out no more.
Well, you're real sweet to make it for me. There never was nobody like you. And you don't need to worry, I ain't goin' out no more.
Well, there's no reason you shouldn't go out, Rose... in moderation.
Well, there's no reason you shouldn't go out, Rose... in moderation.
I don't want to. When I was lyin' there in that hospital bed at death's door I says to myself, I ain't goin' out no more. If I ever get outta this, I'll just stay home.
Rose, you don't look well and you haven't eaten a bit of breakfast.
I'm not hungry. I can't eat nothin', I haven't been able to eat since I got fired. I think maybe I'm sick.
Well, I... I... I don't know... maybe it was... but no, you can't be sure about a thing like that. It wasn't Billy, I didn't know him.
I know it's embarrassing... but who were you exposed to, dear? ROSE Well, now, Mrs. Hillyer, I... ah-h, that's kinda hard to say.
Oh-h, Mrs. Hillyer, I... I can't think. I... I'm not really sure.
Rose, really, you shouldn't act like that.
Rose, really, you shouldn't act like that.
Oh, I know. But I didn't, really. Honestly, I didn't. There was only one, but he's out of town and leave no forwardin' address.
Rose, you don't have to.
I don't mind.
Don't worry, honey, you'll find something.
I was offered that job as a waitress.
I was offered that job as a waitress.
Forget about it, I don't want you working in one of those honky tonks.
You'll never guess what happened! I have met Mr. Right! I been with him all day and he loves me, I know he does, he loves me and he's going to marry met Be's practi'cly ast me already!
Well... well, that's wonderful, Rose.
Well... well, that's wonderful, Rose.
And who do you suppose he is? That policeman who arrested me, the one I bit! He is Mr. Right!
I... I can explain...
I'm looking at this poster, and I'm thinkin', I don't remember seeing films like this when I was in school.

I was going to tell him.
I was going to tell him.
What were you gonna say? Exactly how did you think he was gonna make the leap from dating a sweet, innocent school teacher to an ass-fucking porn star?
What were you gonna say? Exactly how did you think he was gonna make the leap from dating a sweet, innocent school teacher to an ass-fucking porn star?
But... I love him. I do...
Let me tell him. Let him decide.
You're not gonna see him again.
You're not gonna see him again.
What... what makes you think you can order me around?!
What... what makes you think you can order me around?!
Maybe I'm not making myself clear. You're probably the first girl Billy-Boy's ever fallen in love with, and I know for sure you're the first he's slept with. So, how's he gonna feel... ... when he finds out that the only first he is for you is the first guy who didn't have to pull out at the last second to get his close-up?
Hasn't he got enough problems, or didn't you notice that's not cream soda on his breath?
... okay... you made your point.
Indivisible and inseparable.
Incestuous.
Incestuous.
Every person's got their own kinks, beef-cake. What's wrong, Kittle? You don't swing?
What Eve and I wouldn't give to meet up with you on the business end of a daisy chain.
Put up your kickstand, freak. Start talking, or we're out the door.
Put up your kickstand, freak. Start talking, or we're out the door.
A little birdie whispered in my ear today... about the needle-candy you're chasing. It's up here... ... in the old curiosity shop.
How much?
I figure, for this information, the usual payment... times ten.
I figure, for this information, the usual payment... times ten.
You think it's that good?
You think it's that good?
I'll tell you what... I think it's all you've got.
I'll tell you what... I think it's all you've got.
Well... what can I do? You've created a dilemma... And, look at the that. Time's running out. I wonder... how can I impress upon you just exactly how frustrating this situation is for me?
You get nothing and like it. And if we're not blissfully happy with what you tell us, we arrest you just for the fun of it.
Okay, man, okay. I'm with you. I... I heard how the shit's arriving... It's coming in a Lincoln.
And... ?
What and? That's what I got.
What and? That's what I got.
A Lincoln? What Lincoln? Lincoln Continental? Lincoln Mark Five... Six... ?
A Lincoln? What Lincoln? Lincoln Continental? Lincoln Mark Five... Six... ?
Now you know what to watch for...
Now you know what to watch for...
Am I supposed to take this information and sit up in the hills with a frickin' telescope?
Have I ever steered you wrong?
Cuff'em. Let's see what these two love birds say once they're sitting in separate cages.
Take her down to the car, and for Christ's sake be careful this time. Last suspect he took in, butter-fingers dropped her down the stairs. What a mess. Why is it we don't appreciate our arms and legs till we've lost the use of them?
Hey, listen... I'll give you something else, Kittle. Anything. Remember... remember that corpse washed up on Huntington Beach? It was never identified...
Hey, listen... I'll give you something else, Kittle. Anything. Remember... remember that corpse washed up on Huntington Beach? It was never identified...
Who cares?
Who cares?
Alright, wait... there's a dentist in Brentwood peddling morphine...
Alright, wait... there's a dentist in Brentwood peddling morphine...
Careful she doesn't hit her head on the way.
Come on, don't you screw with her, please! You... you got to want this: armored car job. CalTrust Bank. They took two million in cash...
Read my lips: Zimmermann or nothing.
We'll take the CalTrust heist, but if it's no good, we will hunt you down, and Billy-Boy will pull out your spine and he will beat you to death with it.
Fair enough.
This is private property. This is breaking and entering!
Just entering. We'll get to the breaking in a minute.
You're Zimmermann's calculator, Archie. All the blood money you had to move around to make this deal, you got to know something. Maybe they told you, maybe you overheard things you weren't supposed to hear...
I'm telling you, you're barking up the wrong tree.
I'm telling you, you're barking up the wrong tree.
Well, I'm running out of trees, so look me in the eye like a man and tell me you don't know! Convince me!
Well, I'm running out of trees, so look me in the eye like a man and tell me you don't know! Convince me!
I don't know. Fuck off!
It's six o'clock. Time's runaing out. Decide.
If I tell you, how do I know you won't just club me and take it back?
If I tell you, how do I know you won't just club me and take it back?
You don't. It's a gamble. But, not even in Vegas are you gonna get close to this kind of cash. This is <U>two million</U>, Archie. It's not three houses, it's twelve. It's dreams come true.
Three hundred kilos of White Lady hidden inside a giant bust of Abraham Lincoln. A parade float.
What... ?
What... ?
Abe Lincoln...
Kittle...
Where you been hiding, grease-fist? We've been looking for you.
What do you want? I'm clean. I been clean a long time.
Really? Is that a fact... ?
Oh, you fuckers! You fucking fuckers! What? What do you want?
Word is, while the vice cops on the East Coast were standing around playing pocket pool, 300 kilos of heroin got smuggled into New York City. And, right now it's making a cross-country journey to Hollywood, U.S.A.
Hey now... what the fuck... ?
Again.
Know what he's doing, Benny? He's trying to jog your memory.
I don't know what you're talking about, man. Even if I did, I'm not so crazy I'm gonna cross Zimmermann.
I don't know what you're talking about, man. Even if I did, I'm not so crazy I'm gonna cross Zimmermann.
This scag is enough to keep every junkie from here to the Mexican border high as a kite for the next two years. You think we're gonna let Zimmermann haul it onto <U>our</U> streets on the Fourth-of-fucking-July!?
Last time Billy-Boy did this, the guy's neck broke... ... just like that. Sad in a way. Why is it we don't truly appreciate our arms and legs till we've lost the use of them?
Alright! Alright... put me down...
It's bone dry out there. Everybody's hurting. The stuff floating around's been cut so many times it's like powdered sugar, but Zimnermann's gonna fix it.
I need the "when" and the "where."
I need the "when" and the "where."
I don't know, okay? All I know is Butch Cassidy's back in town.
How's your precious little school-marm today?
She's fine, as if you cared.
She's fine, as if you cared.
Tell me something... what's a school teacher doing having you meet for breakfast in one of the filthiest parts of downtown skank-ville? I mean, this is not the place for fine dining, unless looking at prostitutes stimulates your appetite.

Filthy kids go to kindergarten too. What are you saying, anyhow?

Nothing, I guess. Just an observation. She's really something special. You're a lucky fella.

Lay off once, would you?
Lay off once, would you?
What'd I say?
What'd I say?
It's the way you say it, like there's something more too it.
She's right. If you two are doing the horizontal polka, the last thing you want is a thirty-five pound bundle-of-joy stumbling around, knocking over furniture and calling you "daddy."
Jeez... it's too early in the morning for this. Leave off. Here's your paper.
Jeez... it's too early in the morning for this. Leave off. Here's your paper.
What, am I supposed to read it while I drive? Keep a grip on it, alright?
You shouldn't litter.
Thank you, concerned citizen.
Thank you, concerned citizen.
Give a Hoot. Don't Pollute.
Give a Hoot. Don't Pollute.
I'll give you a fucking hoot if you don't shut up back there.
Just a little, you know... Bicentennial memento. Nothing special.
Whoa, thanks, man. These are cool. They'll be collector's items.
Escort everyone's favorite She-Male over here nice and peaceful-like. Let's not have another incident like at the laundromat. I'll never forget the look on that poor woman's face.
That wasn't my fault.
That wasn't my fault.
Save it. Just go.
I... I can't find my seatbelt.
What do you want me to do about it?
Sons of bitches!
We catch 'em, I wanna be first to hurt 'em. Promise me I get to go first.
We catch 'em, I wanna be first to hurt 'em. Promise me I get to go first.
We'll share.
I can work this.
No you can't.
No you can't.
Get ready.
Make a hole, Billy-Boy.
I'd rather you guys didn't do this again.
I'd rather you guys didn't do this again.
Move it!
This is too fast. This is <U>way</U> too fast!
Relax.
Relax.
We should slow down.
We should slow down.
Hands off the suit, monkey-boy. Close your eyes if you're scared.
Jiminy Christmas.
I can not even begin to imagine how much that must have hurt.
I say, fuck 'em. Let's go.
Well... we shouldn't rush into this, right? Let's talk about it.
Well... we shouldn't rush into this, right? Let's talk about it.
What are you, Henry friggin' Kissinger all the sudden?

You're just saying nothing! Tonight is the night.
You're just saying nothing! Tonight is the night.
Yeah, but if we don't sit, they'll take our badges.
Yeah, but if we don't sit, they'll take our badges.
What of it? Haven't we waited forever... ? Haven't we, honey? Haven't we waited long enough to get this scumbag?
All I got is being a cop. What do I do if I'm not that?
You big, fat sonofabitch, if it weren't for me, you'd still be sitting in the file room where I found you. And you... Nena... you've still got needle scars from where I pulled you out of. You of all people...
We shoulda been there to back you up. We shoulda!
Stop blaming yourself.
Ah, jeez, Billy... careful!
I got him.
"A.D."
Who's that? Zimmermann's money-man?
Where you gonna be?
It's personal. We'll hook up at Billy-Boy's pad in an hour. See ya then.
No offices are gonna be open today.
Lots of these pencil-pushers work out of their homes. It's a tax dodge.
Okay, we got... one, two... three... Two Caddies and Poe's Mustang.
Could be worse. I don't know how, but I'm sure it could.
Remember those two uniform cops who been giving us such a hard time... ?
Yeah.
Yeah.
The ones you got in that fist-fight with a couple a weeks ago... ?
The ones you got in that fist-fight with a couple a weeks ago... ?
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's them trying to kill us.
That's them trying to kill us.
Well, they sure know how to hold a grudge.
Look, Kittle... pull over and let me out. I'll be fine... okay? How 'bout that... ? Oh, Lord almighty, listen to me... I don't want to die!! Lemme out of this coffin!!
Clench your teeth.
Clench your teeth.
Wh... what... ?!
Wh... what... ?!
Clench your teeth so when we land you don't accidentally bite off your tongue.
That's sick.
Welcome to Beverly Hills. Wife-swapping Capital of the World.
What's the plan?
Beats me. You got a suggestion, feel free to shout it out, genius.
When you planning to cut back on that?
What?
What?
The booze.
The booze.
I don't know. I could quit now if I wanted, I just don't want to.
I don't know what the problem is. Plenty of great men throughout history got their bravery out of a bottle
Name one.
Name one.
Dean Martin.
Dean Martin.
Entertainers don't count.
Who's been giving you history lessons? Your bartender?
Okay, seriously. What about Napoleon, huh?
Okay, seriously. What about Napoleon, huh?
What about him?
What about him?
You've never heard of Napoleon brandy, Mister Smarty-Pants? How do you think it got its name?
They... they shot me.
They shot us all, kid.
They shot us all, kid.
What day is it?
What day is it?
Same day as before. I think.
Where we going?
We're gonna rain on Zimmermann's parade.
How you doing back there?
Feeling great.
Gimmie a butt.
You don't smoke.
You don't smoke.
I'm not taking a cigarette break, jackass, just give me one!
Happy Independence Day.
Yeah. Happy Fourth of July.
Why do I always have to sit in back?
It's just the way things are, kiddo.
It's just the way things are, kiddo.
Well, I would like to sit in front today.
Well, I would like to sit in front today.
It's not gonna happen.
You been wearing rubbers, Billy-Boy?
Wha... ?
Wha... ?
Birth control's important.
Birth control's important.
What... what kinda thing is that to say?
You know, the more weight back there, the faster the car goes.
Bullshit.
Bullshit.
You never heard of physics, Einstein? The laws of physics. The more ballast we keep closer to the rear tires...

I'm back here, aren't I? So, you don't have to make up a buncha lies to make me feel good about it.
Oh... okay.
What's mine say?
"Leo. The stages of the moon are in alignment, so now is a perfect time for a vigorous regimen of self improvement. Wash yourself more carefully each morning, stop using pies and cakes as your primary source of nourishment, and quit tucking your shirttails inside your underwear."
"Leo. The stages of the moon are in alignment, so now is a perfect time for a vigorous regimen of self improvement. Wash yourself more carefully each morning, stop using pies and cakes as your primary source of nourishment, and quit tucking your shirttails inside your underwear."
It doesn't say that.
It doesn't say that.
No, but it should.
Hey...
Forgive me for not ooing cartwheels over commemorative salt and pepper shakers
That's him alright.
It's go time, Billy-B.
Smooth move, hot-shot.
What was I supposed to do?
Laugh it up. You'll cry later.
You'll cry like a great big, blubbering baby.
What the... ?! What was that for?
Follow me.
Follow me.
How come everyone thinks hitting me's the best way to get my attention?
Where we going?
We have to find Kittle.
Okay. But, what changed our mind?
Just keep an eye out till I get this rig up and running.
Let's go! Fuck everything! God damn sons of bitching mother humpers... I'm gonna rip'em all brand new assholes... !
Hey... HEY! Cool down, Jumbo!
I can't believe we're stealing.
We're not stealing. We're borrowing.
We're not stealing. We're borrowing.
No, we're stealing.
No, we're stealing.
This is the police lock-up. We're police. How can we steal from ourselves?
This is the police lock-up. We're police. How can we steal from ourselves?
Then, why'd we tie him up?
Who said it wa's me, hub? Anyway... he fell off a ladder. It wasn't really my fault.
Well, I got something.. Pop-Sweet's accounting ledger for the Disco-Strip. All the money transactions. Look... Someone's putting their initials beside the weekly totals. Like they're acknowledging a deposit.
You live like a pig.
Can't you say something nice once?
Can't you say something nice once?
Okay. It doesn't smell as bad in here as I remember it smelling.
Bad news is, word's spreading like wildfire that we don't have badges, and nobody wants to end up getting splattered like Butch Cassidy either.
If we don't catch a break soon, we're gonna be left standing with our dicks in our hands.
If we don't catch a break soon, we're gonna be left standing with our dicks in our hands.
Speak for yourself.
Whoa, whoa... it's gonna be alright.
... where... where's a jerk like me ever gonna find another girl to love him... huh?...
Don't talk like that. There's plenty of women around for jerks like you.
You're lying...
You plan on shooting that gun or just hugging it?
I'm waiting till the time's right.
What about Jack Daniels? Wasn't he a decorated general in the Civil War?
No.
No.
General Jim Beam, then.
General Jim Beam, then.
Nope.
Nope.
Oh. Well. I think it's pretty common knowledge that in the Battle of Little Big Horn, Custer was drunk off his ass.
Billy, I love you I really do... but I've got to tell you, every day, in every way, you give new meaning to the word "stupidity."
What can I say to that... except, I love you too, you mean-spirited bitch.
You could start over again with cash like that.
Go wherever you want. Live how you want.
Feels like there's a bullet still in my chest.
There probably is.
There probably is.
Bummer.
He tried to kill us.
We've got the tape to prove it.
Hey now, look! Let's all get on the same page here. This shipment is do or die for Zimmermann's syndicate; all or nothing. If we stop the drugs, we don't even have to catch him red-handed. He's ruined cause his pushers go broke with nothing to sell. On the other hand, if we fuck this up, it means more zombies crawling the gutters than
There'll be other chances.
There'll be other chances.
Not like this. Are you even listening?
I'm gonna put a great big, ear-to-fucking-ear smile on your face. How 'bout that?
Where have you been?
Where have you been?
I'm here. That's all that counts. Watch... you'll enjoy this... it's like magic...
Our resignations.
You going rogue on me?
You going rogue on me?
Maybe.
Maybe.
What happened, Kittle? We used to be friends. You used to know how the game was played.
What happened, Kittle? We used to be friends. You used to know how the game was played.
You mean taking bribes, and skimming busts and letting hoods walk? You mean not being able to sleep at night after shaking down some honest Joe?

There was a time when you did things the right way, till you hooked up with that fat-assed-boozehound and the soul-sister.
It's noon straight up. Effective immediately, you three work desk jobs till midnight.
You can't be serious.
You can't be serious.
Can't I?
Can't I?
We've been chasing this deal six months, and now you're gonna chuck it out the window?
He went to pick up lunch.
Well, shake a leg. Get these files downstairs... And, quit listening to your fucking voodoo music.
Well, shake a leg. Get these files downstairs... And, quit listening to your fucking voodoo music.
Yes, sir.
And, what... what am I forgetting? Oh, yes... the transvestite junkie whose bullet riddled body came blasting through the front doors of the precinct house!
Well, sir...
Well, sir...
No. Don't open your mouth! You <U>honestly</U> think you can explain this to my satisfaction?

Don't bother. This behavior's gone on too long. You're suspended.
What?
Don't you condescend to tell me how or why to honor Independence Day, and don't tell me I'm overreacting when I'm trying to bust the guy responsible for half the filthy junk coming into this city!
You're about an inch away from insubordination!
You're about an inch away from insubordination!
Well... seeing how you just suspended me, what's to stop me from calling you a crazy bastard, you old fart?
Well... seeing how you just suspended me, what's to stop me from calling you a crazy bastard, you old fart?
Till the last firework fizzles out tonight, detective, you sit a desk. And, after that, I'll decide if you keep your shield.
What can we do for you, officers? What new, mindless harassments have you planned this morning?
Just wanted to make you aware... before today's over, we'll be standing on top of your mountain of horse and pissing down on you.
Just wanted to make you aware... before today's over, we'll be standing on top of your mountain of horse and pissing down on you.
Thank you for sharing that charming image.
Couldn't have said it better myself.
You bust some small-time pimps, whores and dime-bag junkies, like the world's a better place because you're in it. And for what, Kittle... two hundred and fifty dollars a week? Tell me, how does anyone get so self-rightious when they can barely afford to pay their rent?

Just 'cause you belong to some fancy-pants club, doesn't make you any less a murderer.
Just 'cause you belong to some fancy-pants club, doesn't make you any less a murderer.
Murderer? Really?
Thanks, but we don't recognize "brunch" as an actual meal.
I insist. What will it be? Boston Tea Party Clam Chowder, or maybe the Chicken Red, White and Cordon Bleu? No... There's a special on the menu, today only... ... <U>roasted</U> <U>pig</U>.
Your poison's not gonna make it into the veins of any kids this time.
Wave that flag, hero. Keep dreaming those dreams.
You fuckers... damn you! Why?! Why me!? Why the obsession with me?
It's our job.
It's our job.
You think you accomplished something... like you're heroes? Fuck you! This is meaningless! You'll never win! You know, as soon as I'm gone... someone's going to take my place.
Pardon me... my mistake. Taking your thoughts in hand, huh... ?
Whoops... don't mind me. Go ahead and finish up.
Pure horse.
You are such a disappointment, Benny.
Arriving tonight
Going into Zimmermann's pipeline.
Why do you bother with that mumbo-jumbo crap? Some fruitcake's writing it between bong hits, making it up as he goes, and you're actually taking the time to read it.
Yeah, non-believer? Here's yours... "Scorpio, October 24 to November 22: Jupiter is in conflict with Saturn, so proceed with caution..."
Yeah, non-believer? Here's yours... "Scorpio, October 24 to November 22: Jupiter is in conflict with Saturn, so proceed with caution..."

What are you, communist? At least numb-nuts here has the courtesy to pretend he likes them.
I just think you should show some respect. I mean, call me old fashioned, but 200 years ago when Ben Franklin and those guys signed the Constitution and Declaration of Independence, they did that so we could all share in the freedom...
First of all, the Constitution wasn't writtem till 1787...

Second of all, the Declaration of Independence was all for liberty and equality, but it didn't do anything about slavery, did it?

All I'm saying is, your little Bicentennial mementos would be more accurate if there were no holes in the pepper shaker so the pepper couldn't get out.
Alright?
Absolutely.
We got him.
Slow down.
Slow down.
"Go, go, go!" "Slow down." Make up your mind.
"Go, go, go!" "Slow down." Make up your mind.
Don't crowd him.
Hold your horses, sweetpea. We need Butch Cassidy alive, remember?
Shit. You're right.
If they crash, maybe he'll run. You can shoot him in the leg or something.
Let's hope.
I'm gonna get beside him.
No you're not.
I'm gonna get beside. Nena, you're gonna shoot out his tires.
No, we are <U>not</U> going to do that.
You... SUCK! You almost got us all killed!
You think this is so easy?
You think this is so easy?
Can't be worse than you.
Can't be worse than you.
Oh yeah?
Oh yeah?
That's right, white bread. Give it up. Right now.
That's right, white bread. Give it up. Right now.
Okay, okay... hold on. Don't go getting your panties in a knot...
Get closer! Don't lose him!
I kinda already figured that, but keep those helpful hints coming.
You put your bumper just behind his left tire and then accelerate... make him spin out...
Is there nothing in this world you enjoy more than the sound of your own voice?
What... ? Not you too?
He's right. We hit the bricks, we walk back triple-fucked.

That's not true.
That's not true.
I know it is, even if you don't.
Yeah, my arms healed up real good, and that's how I wanna keep 'em. That's what I'm trying to tell you.
Guys... all we've got is each other. Don't we know that by now?
You need a doctor.
Nothing's broke. Keep sewing. And quit pacing, you big ox. You're making me skittish.
Any preferences?
Whatever goes bang.
Let's get this thing done.
All for one...
Alright, flesh-peddler, let's see empty hands!
Out here. On your knees.
You get him?
Dead.
Dead.
Chalk up another victory for Billy-Boy's one man war on crime.
If it is, that's pretty high up on the totem pole. What do you think?
Gimmie a minute.
Alright... how about you two hit the strip and start knocking some heads together? Find out who "A.D." is. I got a quick errand to run.
Sounds good.
Been waiting long?
Just got here.
Just got here.
How'd we do?

Maybe it's enough.
Get his attention.
Your wish is my command.
Hey-Ho... ! Maybe we're not alone in this thing after all.
Who is that... ?
What the hell's his problem?
You mean, besides the warrant out on us for blowing up our commanding officer?
You're... you're not doing what I think you're doing... ?
Seatbelts fastened, please.
You suck at lying, Archie.
See... now that we know you know, the hard part's done for us.
See... now that we know you know, the hard part's done for us.
It's just a question of how long do we have to slap you silly till you spill the beans.
We're screwed.
I'm well aware of that.
This much powder you don't throw in the trunk with a blanket over it. It's got to be smuggled.
There's not even enough places to stash it in a car.
No more counting the big money for someone else.
Beholden to none.
Think Zimmermann's watching?
Who the fuck knows? We'll find out soon enough.
You John-Wilkes-Booth-ed him.
Billy! Billy!
Why the beach?
So there's nobody around to get killed in the explosion.
Oh, yeah... the explosion.
Know what I love about dynamite?

I don't think so.

Well, that's what I heard, and that's what I choose to believe.
The gang's all here!
Keep 'em busy.
You see that?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Good. Thought I was imagining them.
You always did have style.
It's one of a kind.
It's one of a kind.
So are you, Pop-Sweet. That's why...
This shit was Ming.
That's the problem with expensive tastes... the more you got, the more you got to lose.
Where's your pet gorilla and the female Uncle Tom?
They're... around.
They're... around.
Yeah? So, what do you want to ask today that I can't answer? I'm a busy man.

The way Zimmermann takes such good care of you and this drug-peddling "escort service" of yours, I figure you got the scoop on the pharmaceuticals arriving tonight.

Well, let me tell you how it is...
Admiral, we're in position. All fighters accounted for.
Proceed with the countdown. All groups assume attack coordinates.
All craft, prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark.
All right. Stand by.
We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat.
You won't get another chance at this, Admiral.

Han will have that shield down. We've got to give him more time.
At that close range, we won't last long against those Star Destroyers.
We'll last longer then we will against that Death Star...and we might just take a few of them with us.
The shield is down! Commence attack on theDeath Star's main reactor.
We're on our way. Red Group, Gold Group, all fighters follow me. Told you they'd do it!
I can't do it, Artoo. I can't go on alone.
Yoda will always be with you.
You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father.
You father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your father was destroyed. So what I have told you was true... from a certain point of view.
There's still good in him.
I also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.

Vader humbled you when first you met him, Luke... but that experience was part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value of patience. Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been prepared.

But I had to help my friends.
To be a Jedi, Luke, you must confront and then go beyond the dark side - the side your father couldn't get past. Impatience is the easiest door - for you, like your father. Only, your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door, and you have held firm. You're no longer so reckless now, Luke. You are

Hmm. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous.

Leia! Leia's my sister.
Leia! Leia's my sister.
Your insight serves you well. Bury your feelings deep down, Luke. They do you credit. But they could be made to serve the Emperor.
But you can't let her get involved now, Ben. Vader will destroy her.
She hasn't been trained in the ways of the Jedi the way you have, Luke... but the Force is strong with her, as it is with all of your family. There is no avoiding the battle. You must face and destroy Vader!
Shhh. You have hibernation sickness.
I can't see.
I can't see.
Your eyesight will return in time.
Your eyesight will return in time.
Where am I?
Where am I?
Jabba's palace.
Jabba's palace.
Who are you?
The Death Star will be completed on schedule.
You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker.
You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker.
Yes, my Master.
Yes, my Master.
Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force.

As you wish.
As you wish.
Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen.
What is thy bidding, my Master?
Send the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until called for.

What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust?

It is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young Skywalker will be one of us! Your work here is finished, my friend. Go out to the command ship and await my orders.
It is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young Skywalker will be one of us! Your work here is finished, my friend. Go out to the command ship and await my orders.
Yes, my Master.
I told you to remain on the command ship.
A small Rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on Endor.
I have felt him, my Master.
Strange, that I have not. I wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear, Lord Vader.
They are clear, my Master.
Then you must go to the Sanctuary Moon and wait for them.
Oh, no, my young Jedi. You will find that it is you who are mistaken...about a great many things.
His lightsaber.
Han!
Luke!
Luke!
Are you all right?
Are you all right?
Fine. Together again, huh?
Fine. Together again, huh?
Wouldn't miss it.
Wouldn't miss it.
How are we doing?
How are we doing?
The same as always.
The same as always.
That bad, huh? Where's Leia?
I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a big light blur.
There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know.
There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know.
You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient.

Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything.
Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything.
Oh... great!
Why don't you leave that crate and come with us?
I have a promise I have to keep first... to an old friend.
Luke.
Hi, Han... Chewie.
You got her warmed?
Yeah, she's comin' up.
Right. Chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do. Ready, everybody?
All set.
Vader's on that ship.
Now don't get jittery, Luke. There are a lot of command ships. Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep your distance.
I don't know. Fly casual.
I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come.
I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come.
It's your imagination, kid. Come on. Let's keep a little optimism here.
Chewie and I will take care of this. You stay here.
Quietly, there might be more of them out there.
I thought she was with you.
We got separated.
Take the squad ahead. We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300.
Come on, Artoo. We'll need your scanners.
Nice work. Great, Chewie! Great! Always thinking with your stomach.
Will you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way to get out of this thing. Han, can you reach my lightsaber?
Will you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way to get out of this thing. Han, can you reach my lightsaber?
Yeah, sure.
Hey!
Han, don't. It'll be all right.
Somehow, I got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
Threepio, tell them if they don't do as you wish, you'll become angry and use your magic.
Someone who loves you.
Leia!
Leia!
I gotta get you out of here.
I don't know. All I can see is a lot of blowing sand!
That's all any of us can see.
Hey, are you awake?
Yeah, I just got a funny feeling. Like I'm not gonna see her again.
Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid.
It'll work. It'll work.
Shall we try and go around?
It'll take time. This whole party'll be for nothing if they see us.
What's going on?
I don't know.
I...
Ahhh...
I'm sorry.
Hold me.
The main entrance to the control bunker's on the far side of that landing platform. This isn't gonna be easy.
Hey, don't worry. Chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.
Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment.
Charges! Come on, come on!
The code's changed. We need Artoo!
Here's the terminal.
I'm sure Luke wasn't on that thing when it blew.
He wasn't. I can feel it.
He wasn't. I can feel it.
You love him, don't you?
Yes.
All right. I understand. Fine. When he comes back, I won't get in the way.
Han! Chewie?
Lando!
Lando, grab it!
Lower it!
Lower it!
I'm trying!
Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando.
No, wait! I thought you were blind!
No, wait! I thought you were blind!
It's all right. Trust me. Don't move.
It's all right. Trust me. Don't move.
All right! A little higher! Just a little higher!
Guess I owe you some thanks, too, Lando.
Figured if I left you frozen like that you'd just give me bad luck the rest of my life, so I might as well get you unfrozen sooner or later.
Well, look at you, a general, huh?
Oh, well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of Taanab.
Look. I want you to take her. I mean it. Take her. You need all the help you can get. She's the fastest ship in the fleet.
All right, old buddy. You know, I know what she means to you. I'll take good care of her. She-she won't get a scratch. All right?
Good luck.
You, too.
Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately.
Good, I hate long waits.
Good, I hate long waits.
You will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea and cast into the pit of Carkoon, the nesting place of the all-powerful Sarlacc.
In his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as you are slowly digested over a thousand years.
On second thought, let's pass on that, huh?
Here we go again.
All right, hang on.
What are you telling them?
Hello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive dialect. But I do believe they think I am some sort of god.
Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this?
I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.
I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.
Proper?!
Proper?!
It's against my programming to impersonate a deity.
What did he say?
I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor.
We're coming!
Come on! Come on!
Come on! Come on!
Oh, Artoo, hurry!
My goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave?
Well, I suppose I could hotwire this thing.
Oh, Princess Leia, are you all right?
Let's see.
Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure. We're honored by your presence.
You may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander. I'm here to put you back on schedule.
I assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working as fast as they can.
Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.
Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.
I tell you, this station will be operational as planned.

But he asks the impossible. I need more men.
But he asks the impossible. I need more men.
Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives.
That is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress.
We shall double our efforts.
We shall double our efforts.
I hope so, Commander, for your sake. The Emperor is not as forgiving as I am.
All wings report in.
Red Leader standing by.
Good shot, Red Two.
Now...come on, Han, old buddy. Don't let me down.
I'm going in.
Here goes nothing.
Now lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power generator.
Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast.
There it is!
All right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator on the north tower.
All right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator on the north tower.
Copy, Gold Leader. I'm already on my way out.
Ugh!
Ohhh, I can't bear to watch.
Oh!
Your Royal Highness.
What's he saying?
He says there's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge.
Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia!
Quiet.
Quiet.
I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.
I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.
Oh, no.
Over there! Two more of them!
I see them. Wait, Leia!
Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother?
Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.
Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.
What do you remember?
What do you remember?
Just...images, really. Feelings.
Just...images, really. Feelings.
Tell me.
Tell me.
She was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad. Why are you asking me all this?
I have no memory of my mother. I never knew her.
Luke, tell me. What's troubling you?
Luke, tell me. What's troubling you?
Vader is here...now, on this moon.
He's my father.
Your father?
Your father?
There's more. It won't be easy for you to hear it, but you must. If I don't make it back, you're the only hope for the Alliance.
Luke, don't talk that way. You have a power I--I don't understand and could never have.
You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it...I have it...and...my sister has it.
Yes. It's you Leia.
I know. Somehow...I've always known.
I know. Somehow...I've always known.
Then you know why I have to face him.
Then you know why I have to face him.
No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you.
No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you.
No, you don't. You've always been strong.
No, you don't. You've always been strong.
But, why must you confront him?
But, why must you confront him?
Because...there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to the Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I have to try.
The Emperor has been expecting you.
I know, father.
I know, father.
So, you have accepted the truth.
Come with me.
Obi-Wan once thought as you do.
You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master.
I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.
I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.
If that is your destiny.
If that is your destiny.
Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate.
Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate.
It is too late for me, son. The Emperor will show you the true nature of the Force. He is your master now.
Obi-Wan has taught you well.
I will not fight you, father.
Your thoughts betray you, father. I feel the good in you...the conflict.
There is no conflict.
There is no conflict.
You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe you'll destroy me now.
You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe you'll destroy me now.
You underestimate the power of the dark side. If you will not fight, then you will meet your destiny.
You cannot hide forever, Luke.
I will not fight you.
I will not fight you.
Give yourself to the dark side. It is the only way you can save your friends. Yes, your thoughts betray you. Your feelings for them are strong. Especially for...
Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her, too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she will.
Never-r-r!
Master Yoda, you can't die.
Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the Force.
Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the Force.
But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.
But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.
No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need.
Yoda, I must know.
Your father he is.
Told you, did he?
Yes.
Unexpected this is, and unfortunate...
Unfortunate that I know the truth?
Well, I'm sorry.
Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware. Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side are they. Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.
Ah, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid, are you not?

Certainly not!

Oh well. How about you.
You!
I'm afraid so, Brad. But wasn't it nice?
Why you - what have you done with Janet?
Nothing. Why do you think I should?
You tricked me. I wouldn't have - I've never - never.
I know, but it wasn't all bad was it? I think you found it quite pleasurable. Oh so soft. So sensual.

Like this. Like how? It's your fault - you're to blame. I thought it was the real thing.
Oh come on, Brad, admit it. It was enjoyable, wasn't it? There's no crime in giving yourself over to pleasure.
You promise you won't tell?
On my mother's grave.
I see. So this wasn't simply a chance meeting. You came here with a purpose.
I told you, my car broke down.
I was telling the truth.
I know what you told me, Brad. But this Dr Everett Scott. His name is not unknown to me.

Hmmmm. He'll be in the Zen Room.
Janet!
Rocky!
It's as if we were glued to the spot.
You are - so quake with fear, you tiny fools.
The future is ours so let's plan it.

So please don't tell me to can it.

Oh Brad, I'm mad.
Dammit, Janet.
Gosh. That's the third motorcyclist that's passed us. They certainly take their lives in their hands. What with the weather and all.
Yes, Janet. Life's pretty cheap to that type.
I think we took the wrong fork a few miles back.
Oh dear! But then where did the motorcyclists come from?
Oh dear! But then where did the motorcyclists come from?
Hmmm ... Well, I guess we will have to turn back.
What was that bang?
We must have a blow-out.

Oh...
You'd better sit here and keep warm while I go for help.
But where will you go? We're in the middle of nowhere.
But where will you go? We're in the middle of nowhere.

Oh, it's probably some kind of hunting lodge for rich weirdos.
Oh....Say something.

I'm engaged to Brad just the same as Betty Monroe was to Ralph Hapschatt. But Frank's kisses overwhelmed me with an ecstacy I've never dreamt of before. Hot, burning kisses.
And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to turn to stone The sweeter the wine The harder to make the break You hear something about someone You'd thought you'd known.
I could see Brad's face before me and my mind screamed No! But my lips were hungry - too hungry.
So baby don't cry like there's no tomorrow After the night there's a brand new day. And there'll be no pain And no more sorrow. So wash your face And phone my place It'll be O.K.

Like this - like how? It's your fault. You're to blame. I was saving myself.

We would like to welcome our viewing audience to the Grand World Championship Bicentennial Heavyweight Fight -- the first major event of the Bicentennial Year... A point of interest is that the fight is being beamed to more than seven hundred and fifty million fans in theatres in nearly every corner of the world. I would like to welcome an old friend, and co-commentator
Thank you, Bob. The electricity is everywhere tonight. Rocky Balboa, a fifty-to-one underdog, is living a Cinderella story which has captured peoples' imaginations all over the world -- to quote a popular sports magazine, 'The fighting style should be 'The Caveman Against the Cavalier.' From the increase in sound it appears the challenger is now approaching the ring... His record is forty-four wins, twenty

I only wonder if this man has the skill to go past three rounds -- Vegas odds say, 'no.'
You could go deaf with the noise -- it undoubtedly means Champion Apollo Creed is heading towards the ring --
Am I seeing right? Creed is approaching the ring in a boat. Is he supposed to be George Washington? Obviously so.

It's been confirmed that it is definitely an impersonation of George Washington -- a great way to start 1976 off.
It's been confirmed that it is definitely an impersonation of George Washington -- a great way to start 1976 off.
I agree.
The Champ stings the slower challenger with jabs at will -- Balboa blocks eighty percent of the blows with his face -- Creed doesn't look the best he's ever been but is moving smoothly -- Creed snaps out a triple combination that backs Balboa into a corner -- oh, a solid hook by Creed, a master of fist-men.
The Champion is smiling and toying with the man -- trying to give the fans their money's worth and make a show of it with the badly out-classes challenger -- Another left to right combination. I feel sorry for --

Creed is down!!!
If you had asked anyone who knows boxing, they never would've predicted a first round knockdown and the second round punishment to the body of the Champion... Most fighters will tell you, receiving a good body punch is the next worst thing to dying.
Round three ready to start and should be interesting to see if Creed can put the challenger away -- there goes the bell.
Apollo almost sprints out of his corner -- feints and throws a pair of left-right combinations. Balboa drops beneath a left upper cut and lands a very solid shot on Creed's temple -- not much movement from Balboa, duck a left, a right, another left and explodes with a right hook to the temple -- I mean explodes. The Champ backs off.
There's no way Apollo expected this kind of hitting power.
There's no way Apollo expected this kind of hitting power.
No way -- but the brilliant ability of the Champion to master situations like this is one of his most outstanding traits -- Creed tosses a perfect right hand that rocks Rocky. Creed on the offensive -- Balboa takes the punishment and counters with a left flush over the heart... that hurt.
Without a doubt this is the most punishing brawl I have ever seen -- The ringside audience is spotted with blood. This fight should have been stopped rounds ago but Rocky Balboa refuses to fall --
Not only has he refused to fall, but he has beaten the Champion's body without mercy and the bout has become a vicious slugfest.
I say ya nothin'!
What's happenin' here?
What's happenin' here?
I'm happenin'! This pig is takin' my shot -- I iz a contender. He's nothin'.

So much has happened lately -- Has it changed your life style much?
...People talk to me more.
...People talk to me more.
How're you preparing for this Bicentennial bout?
We can cut that out later. Apollo Creed says he'll let you stay three rounds before he puts you away.
Apollo's a great fighter.

Do you feel you have a chance?

Maybe --
I'll tear his head off.
Do you have anything derogatory to say about the Champion?

This is your largest payday ever -- How do you feel about it?
Feel? I dunno... Happy.
Feel? I dunno... Happy.
How will you fight Apollo Creed?

Creed's great, ain't he... I'll do what I can.
Is it true the most you've ever made in a prizefight is five hundred dollars?
Four hundred -- But that was a long time ago.

And now your payday will be one hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Any comment?

Listen, I wanna say hi to my girlfriend -- Yo, Adrian!
We don't serve formula. Snookums.
You serve martinis, doncha?
You serve martinis, doncha?
Yeah...
Oh, a ladies man, huh?
My problem is I got a fifty-year-old lust and a three-year-old dinkie.
No. But neither does Roger. That's Diablo Red. Roger's pants are Sunrise Orange.
Well, I'll be...
Well, I'll be...
So what's your next move, Valiant?
Make it dry. Baby doesn't like to be wet. You're Valiant, right? The name's Baby Herman.
I know who you are. Kinda out of your neighborhood, aren't you?
I know who you are. Kinda out of your neighborhood, aren't you?
Yeah, I had to go slummin'. See, a friend of mine's bein' framed.
Yeah, I had to go slummin'. See, a friend of mine's bein' framed.
You mean the rabbit? They got him cold.
You mean the rabbit? They got him cold.
You don't believe that. I mean. the guy's an idiot, a moron, a complete fool... but he'd never kill anyone. I know the guy.
My problem is I come here to drink in peace. So if you don't mind...
C'mon, Valiant, doesn't this whole thing smell a bit funny to you? I mean, no offense, but how did a mucky-muck like R.K. Maroon find you in the first place?
And another thing, the paper said no will was found. But every Toon knows Acme had a will and, in it he promised to leave Toontown to the Toons.
So where is it then?
So where is it then?
Somebody took it from him. That's what this whole thing's about.
My hunch is it was Maroon. He always was after Acme's property.
Yeah? Does he wear pants this color?
Gee, it's swell to see you, Eddie. We miss you in Toontown.
Wish I could say the same. What're you doin' here, Betty?
Wish I could say the same. What're you doin' here, Betty?
Work's been slow for me since the cartoons went to color. But I still got it, Eddie... 'Boop boop be-doop'.
Work's been slow for me since the cartoons went to color. But I still got it, Eddie... 'Boop boop be-doop'.
Yeah, you still got it, Betty. Who's Mr. Jocularity?
Yeah, you still got it, Betty. Who's Mr. Jocularity?
That's Marvin Acme, the gag king.
That's Marvin Acme, the gag king.
Shoulda guessed.

He comes here every night to see Jessica Rabbit.
He comes here every night to see Jessica Rabbit.
Big on the musical comedy, huh?
Big on the musical comedy, huh?
Sounds like you ve never seen her, Eddie.
What's this, Roger?
A tweeting bird?
A tweeting bird?
That's right, a tweeting bird. But what does the script say? 'Rabbit gets conked. Rabbit sees <u>stars</u>!' Not birds, stars!
Please, Raoul. I can give you stars, I know I can. Just drop the safe on my head one more time.
I've already dropped it on you twenty-three times.
I've already dropped it on you twenty-three times.
Don't worry about me. I can take it.
Don't worry about me. I can take it.
I'm not worried about you. I'm worried about the safe.
So, makin' dame jokes, huh, Eddie? Well, lemme remind ya pal, it was a <u>dame</u> who took a hundred bucks out of the till so your landlord would't throw you out of your dump. And it was a <u>dame</u> who trusted you for the money when no one else in town would. And it's a <u>dame</u> who's tired of waitin' for you to straighten
Would this be the same dame who's going to feel awfully foolish when she finds out I've got her money.
This is fifty bucks. I need seventy-five before they check the books tomorrow.
You'll have it in the morning. Now be a sport and lemme have twenty bucks to put in my pocket.
You'll have it in the morning. Now be a sport and lemme have twenty bucks to put in my pocket.
Is this paper even good?
Is this paper even good?
Check the scrawl.
Check the scrawl.
R.K. Maroon.
Hey, Eddie, looks like you really stepped in it this time.
What are you complaining about? Here's your fifty bucks.
A new outfit bought the Red Car. Some big company called Cloverleaf Industries.
No kiddin'? Bought the Red Cars, huh?
No kiddin'? Bought the Red Cars, huh?
Bastards put him on notice.
Do you think the rabbit did it?
I don't wanna think. I wanna drink.
Yeah, Eddie, it's not like you got an ad in the Yellow Pages.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
The papers said the safe door was opened, Eddie.
Stick to stuffin' the olives, willya, Dolores?
So you're not even gonna bother to find out if the rabbit's gettin' framed?
He's a Toon... who cares?
Jesus, Eddie, is this who I think it is?
Dolores, meet Roger Rabbit.
He's a riot.
Oh, yeah? Well, you're not handcuffed to him. Anybody in the back room?
Oh, yeah? Well, you're not handcuffed to him. Anybody in the back room?
It's all yours.
So you decided to help him after all?
I oughta have my head examined. Will you hold still?
Can you get him out of it, Eddie?
If I can find whoever wanted to kill Acme bad enough to get this.
So what's the scam, Eddie?
Maybe Baby Herman was right. Somebody wants Acme's property. Cack the old man, pin it on Roger, and destroy the will.
Maybe they just took it out of his pocket.
Then why'd they bother to crack the safe? You can drop a Mosler 90 from Mount Baldy and it won't open.
Eddie, you still got it. Hey, tomorrow maybe I'll go down to probate court and see who's sniffin' around Acme's estate?
Yeah, do that. I'm gonna go rattle Maroon's cage.
What was <u>that</u>?
<u>That</u> was the rabbit's wife.
<u>That</u> was the rabbit's wife.
The rabbit's wife? Wanna tell me what she was doin' with her arms around you?

Nope. It's that Cloverleaf outfit again.

What the hell would they want with a gag factory?
What the hell would they want with a gag factory?
Got me. But unless the will shows up by Friday midnight, it's theirs.
What's that comin' from the bar?
Sounds like singin'.
Sounds like singin'.
Oh, no...
I was hopin' you'd be there. Maroon's called here about four times. He says he's gotta talk to you tonight. He says he can help you.
I'll bet.
I'll bet.
Are you gonna call him, Eddie?
Are you gonna call him, Eddie?
What've I got to lose? You okay, Dolores?
What've I got to lose? You okay, Dolores?
Yeah... they closed me down for a coupla weeks.
Yeah... they closed me down for a coupla weeks.
That'll work out just fine. When this thing is over, I'll take you to Catalina. How does that sound?
That'll work out just fine. When this thing is over, I'll take you to Catalina. How does that sound?
Familiar. Be careful, Eddie.
He's not my client. I was workin' for R.K. Maroon.
Yes, we talked to Mr. Maroon. He told us the rabbit became quite agitated when you showed him the pictures, and said nothing would stand in the way of him getting his wife back. Is that true?
Yes, we talked to Mr. Maroon. He told us the rabbit became quite agitated when you showed him the pictures, and said nothing would stand in the way of him getting his wife back. Is that true?
Hey, pal, do I look like a stenographer?
Men? They look more like weasles to me.
Yes, I find that weasles have a special gift for the work. The rabbit didn't contact you by any chance, did he?
Yes, I find that weasles have a special gift for the work. The rabbit didn't contact you by any chance, did he?
Why would he contact me? I just took some lousy pictures.
Why would he contact me? I just took some lousy pictures.
So you wouldn't have any idea where he might be?
So you wouldn't have any idea where he might be?
Have you tried Walla Walla? Kokomo's very nice this time of year.
Being caught breaking and entering is not very good advertising for a detective. What were you looking for, Mr. Valiant?
Ask her...
Marvin Acme had no will. I should know, the probate is in my court.
He had a will, all right. She took it off Acme the night she and R.K. Maroon knocked him off. Then she set up her loving husband to take the fall.
They must've taken it off me.
They?
They?
The other people who were in here lookin' for the will. I woulda caught 'em if Cheetah here hadn't interrupted me.
Take it easy, Bongo. We'll handle Mr. Valiant our own way... downtown.
Downtown? Fine. Get a hold of Santino, I'd be more than glad to talk to him.
Downtown? Fine. Get a hold of Santino, I'd be more than glad to talk to him.
Oh, not <u>that</u> downtown. <u>Toon</u>town.
You're not takin' me to downtown <u>Toon</u>town?
Indeed we are. We'll continue the interrogation there.
Indeed we are. We'll continue the interrogation there.
I ain't tellin' you nothin'! Get me Santino.
I ain't tellin' you nothin'! Get me Santino.
You're a very stubborn man, Mr. Valiant. Very pig-headed. Boys, show Mr. Valiant how we handle pig-headed men at the Toontown station...
I don't think it's gonna matter. Sorry, pal, I tried.
Yes, and for that you're charged with aiding and abetting. But we'll let Santino handle that.
Well, why not? I'm feeling magnanimous tonight. The successful conclusion of this case draws the curtain on my career as a jurist. I'm retiring to take a new role in the private sector.
Yeah? Well, don't expect the Toons to give you a gold watch.
These roads can be very treacherous at night, especially in a maniacal Toon vehicle.
The pot's callin' the kettle maniacal.
The pot's callin' the kettle maniacal.
I've had enough of your insolence! Put him in my car. I think they'll enjoy attending our ribbon cutting at the Acme factory.
No matter. I don't expect the will to show up in the next fifteen minutes. By then Cloverleaf will own Toontown quite legally.
So you're Cloverleaf?
So you're Cloverleaf?
No one person is Cloverleaf. We're a vast company with diverse interests... gasoline, tires, automobiles.
Come on, Doom. What would a company like that want with Toontown?
It wasn't Toontown they wanted. It was my idea of how to put the land to better use.
Don't you think anyone's gonna notice that Toontown's gone?
They won't care. Who's going to miss some ridiculous talking mice when they can have the future?
Right here where we're standing, will be the cornerstone of my idea... the cloverleaf -- an elegant cement structure that intertwines freeways.
What the hell's a freeway?
What the hell's a freeway?
A freeway, Mr. Valiant, is eight lanes of asphalt running uninterrupted from L.A. to Pasadena. Pasadena to Hollywood. Hollywood to Santa Monica. Someday everyone will be in cars driving happily, non-stop from one end of the L.A. Basin to another.
A freeway, Mr. Valiant, is eight lanes of asphalt running uninterrupted from L.A. to Pasadena. Pasadena to Hollywood. Hollywood to Santa Monica. Someday everyone will be in cars driving happily, non-stop from one end of the L.A. Basin to another.
That's what this is all about? Tell me, who's gonna use your lousy freeway? We got the Red Cars, the best public transportation in the country.
That's what this is all about? Tell me, who's gonna use your lousy freeway? We got the Red Cars, the best public transportation in the country.
Not for long. We're retiring the Red Cars. People will drive, Mr. Valiant, because they'll have to. And when they drive, they'll have to buy our cars, our tires, our gasoline.
Holy shit, he's a Toon!
Surprised?
Surprised?
Not really. Only a Toon could think of something as goofy as that freeway idea.
You?
That's right, me.
Here's one for the books... a Toon wearin' human clothes.
Earl... it's me, Valiant.
Earl... it's me, Valiant.
Eddie? Jesus, what happened?
Eddie? Jesus, what happened?
Toon cops worked me over.
Toon cops worked me over.
Boy, I'll say. They gave you a real Toon-a-Roo.
Boy, I'll say. They gave you a real Toon-a-Roo.
What am I, Earl?
You're a pig... a happy-go-lucky pig.
No...
No...
Does it hurt?
Does it hurt?
Not much. It's hard to talk.
Not much. It's hard to talk.
Uh, Eddie, do me a favor. Could you sit in the back so you won't cause as much of a commotion.
Last week some heavy breather wanted one of my nylons as a souvenir. Maybe that's what he was after?
Look, doll, if I wanted underwear, I woulda broken into Frederick's of Hollywood. I was lookin' for Marvin Acme's will.
Hello, Mr. Valiant. I rang the doorbell, but I guess you couldn't hear it.
That's because I don't have a doorbell.
Oh... well, I... I just had to see you.
Okay, you've seen me. Now give me a towel.
Come on, lady, haven't you ever seen a mole before?
Toons aren't given imperfections.
Toons aren't given imperfections.
No? I guess we're not counting lying, stealing and murder.
No? I guess we're not counting lying, stealing and murder.
You've got the wrong idea about me. I'a a pawn in this just like poor Roger. Can you help me find him? I'll pay you anything.
You've got the wrong idea about me. I'a a pawn in this just like poor Roger. Can you help me find him? I'll pay you anything.
Yeah, I'll bet you would. You gotta have the rabbit to make the scam work.
Yeah, I'll bet you would. You gotta have the rabbit to make the scam work.
No, no, no... I love my husband.
No, no, no... I love my husband.
Oh, sure. I can just feature you standin' outside your little hutch, holdin' a carrot cake waitin' for hubby to come home.
Oh, sure. I can just feature you standin' outside your little hutch, holdin' a carrot cake waitin' for hubby to come home.
Oh, please don't make fun of me, Mr, Valiant. You don't know how hard it is being a woman looking the way I do.
Oh, please don't make fun of me, Mr, Valiant. You don't know how hard it is being a woman looking the way I do.
Yeah, well, you don't know how hard it is bein' a man looking at a woman looking the way you do.
Yeah, well, you don't know how hard it is bein' a man looking at a woman looking the way you do.
I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way.
I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way.
I'm not complainin'. But give me credit. I'm the guy who took the pictures of you and Acme playin' pattycake, remember?
So altruistic.
It's the truth. Why won't you believe it?
It's the truth. Why won't you believe it?
Cause I don't take Acme Dumb Pills. I don't know what you're up to, lady, but I'm gonna nail you for the Acme murder.
Cause I don't take Acme Dumb Pills. I don't know what you're up to, lady, but I'm gonna nail you for the Acme murder.
If I'm as bad as you think, what's stopping me from just killing you right now?
You shot Roger.
That's not Roger. It's one of Doom's men. He killed R.K. Maroon.
Lady, I guess I had you pegged wrong.
Don't worry, you're not the first. We better get out of here.
It was Doom who killed Acme, you know?
Why didn't you tell me?
Why didn't you tell me?
I didn't know who I could trust.
I didn't know who I could trust.
We're even. By the way, I did find your husband.
We're even. By the way, I did find your husband.
Where is he?
Where is he?
He's right here in the...
How did you get onto Doom?
Marvin told me. Doom was after his land. Ne was afraid. That's why he brought me his will.
So where is it?
When I opened up the blue envelope, all that was inside was a blank piece of paper.
When I opened up the blue envelope, all that was inside was a blank piece of paper.
A joker to the end.
Looks like our goose is cooked, our hash is slung, our fait is accompli...
Lemme guess where you got that from. Tell me somethin', what'd you ever see in that guy anyway?
Lemme guess where you got that from. Tell me somethin', what'd you ever see in that guy anyway?
He made me laugh.
Hold on a second.
Eddie, come on.
Tell me you didn't do a snoop job for a Toon named Roger the Rabbit.
That's what you woke me up for?
Now what?
Just haven't been this close to Toontown for awhile.
They say the rabbit got the safe idea from a cartoon he was makin' the other day.
What a gasser.
What a gasser.
Wait here...
Where'd this gargoyle come from anyway?
No one knows. He bought the election a few years back. He's been rulin' Toontown ever since.
What's with the dip?
That's how he gets rid of the troublemakers. It's a combination of acetone, turpentine and paint remover. He calls it the... Final Solution.
What the hell is that?
Doom.
Doom.
Jesus Christ... <u>that</u> was the Judge?
Valiant, did you see the rabbit?
He was blowin' his lines, all right. So what?
He was blowin' his lines, all right. So what?
So what? He's already put me three weeks behind on the shooting schedule!
How much do you know about show business, Valiant?
Only there's no business like it, no business I know.
Yeah, and there's no business as expensive. I'm twenty-five grand over budget on the latest Bunnysitter cartoon and it's all because that rabbit can't keep his mind on his work. And you know why?
One too many safes dropped on his head?
One too many safes dropped on his head?
Nah, that goes with the territory. He's a stunt bunny.
Here's the problem... "Seen cooing over calamari with notsonew Sugar Daddy was Jessica Rabbit... wife of Maroon star, Roger". His wife's a tramp, but he thinks she's Betty Crocker. The doubt's eatin' him up.
So what do you want me to do?
So what do you want me to do?
Get me a couple juicy pictures. Somethin' I can wise the rabbit up with.
Get me a couple juicy pictures. Somethin' I can wise the rabbit up with.
I don't work in Toontown.
I don't work in Toontown.
You don't have to. The rabbit's wife sings at an underground Toon revue joint called The Ink & Paint Club. You can catch her in action there.

A hundred bucks? That's ridiculous.
So's the job.
I got him on loan from Disney.
Aren't you the lucky one...
When will I hear from you?
As soon as is humanly possible.
Well, you better start thinkin' about drinkin' it black.
Frankly, I'm shocked. Marvin Acme's been my friend and neighbor for thirty years.
Son-of-a-bitch... Mr. Maroon, I think I'll be goin' now, so about the rest of my fee...
Sure, Valiant, sure...
Hi, Mr. Maroon. Remember me?
Valiant? What're you doin' here?
Valiant? What're you doin' here?
I Just thought I'd drop by and show you a photograph.
I Just thought I'd drop by and show you a photograph.
I've already seen your photographs.
I've already seen your photographs.
Yeah, but I enlarged this one. Thought you might be interested.
Maroon? Whaddaya want?
Have you got the will?
Have you got the will?
Maybe. Why?
Maybe. Why?
Meet me at my studio at nine o'clock. If you've got the will maybe we can stop this thing.
Meet me at my studio at nine o'clock. If you've got the will maybe we can stop this thing.
Stop what?
Valiant! You surprised me.
That was the idea.
You're not too good at this, are you, R.K.?
No... I'm not. I'm a cartoon maker, not a murderer.
No... I'm not. I'm a cartoon maker, not a murderer.
Well, everybody needs a hobby.
Well, everybody needs a hobby.
No, you gotta understand, Valiant, I had nothin' to do with Acme gettin' killed. I just wanted to sell my studio. But they wouldn't buy my property unless Acme would sell his. And he wouldn't. So I was gonna blackmail Acme with pictures of him and the rabbit's wife.
You got the will in there, don't ya?
No, I don't.
No, I don't.
You tricked me, damn you!
You tricked me, damn you!
Take it easy.
Take it easy.
There's no time to take it easy! You don't realize the diabolical mind we're dealing with!
Pattycake! Pattycake!
Baker's man... but no use ruinin' a good pair of shoes over it.
My advice? Hop on over to Reno, get yourself a quickie divorce.
Divorce? Never!
Aah!

I needed a place to hide. I'm in trouble, Eddie.

Oh, yeah? Then how'd you find my house?
Oh, yeah? Then how'd you find my house?
Well, I asked the newsboy on the corner. He didn't know. Then I asked a janitor, the fireman and finally the green grocer down the way. He was very helpful.

In other words, the whole goddamn world knows you're here! Out! Get out!
Look, pal, if you're still here when I finish this drink, I'm callin' the police.
Don't do that! I'm innocent I tell ya. The police'll just dip me. They were waitin' for me when I got home last night. I ran.
Don't do that! I'm innocent I tell ya. The police'll just dip me. They were waitin' for me when I got home last night. I ran.
If you're so innocent, why'd you run?

Gee, Eddie, I'm a rabbit. We always run.
Eddie Valiant... you're under arrest! Just kidding...
You idiot. I lost the key for those cuffs.
Hey! What do you think you're doin'?
Sorry, Eddie, I forgot you're not a Toon.
Sorry, Eddie, I forgot you're not a Toon.
Don't ever forget that.
Does this help?
Yeah, that's better.
You mean to tell me you coulda taken your hand outta that cuff at any time?
Well, no, not <u>any</u> time. Only when it was funny.
Are you always this funny, or only on days when you're wanted for murder?
My philosophy is if you don't have a sense of humor, you're better off dead.

Yeah... well you just might get your wish.
Yeah. I think Maroon plays the part of the sound mind, your wife the sound body.
I resent that innuendo! My wife is completely innocent.

Your wife may be a lot of things, pal, but innocent isn't one of them.
The habeus corpus is thickening.
Yeah. Except they screwed up. I don't think they got the will.
Yeah. Except they screwed up. I don't think they got the will.
How do you know that?
How do you know that?
Well, Acme had the will in his pocket that night at the club. It was gone in the morning when the cops found the body.
Well, Mr. Smarty-Pants Detective, your logic is specious. What prevented Mr. Acme from putting the will back in the safe before they killed him?
Because he's not forty feet tall. The safe was up on the ceiling, remember?
Hey, don't I get an encore?
Why, you crazy Toon... I've been out there riskin' my neck for you. I come back here and you're singin' and dancin'.

Drink it, jerk. All of it.
Oh, Eddie, that was quick thinkin'. Nothin' like usin' the old noggin, the noodle, the grey matter...
If I'm so smart, how come I'm runnin' from the law with a Toon?
Valiant and Valiant? Who's the other Valiant?
My brother. Get inside.
So what's our plan, our scenario, our modus operandi?
We can't do anything till it's dark.
Say, who's this guy laughin'?
Me.

Yeah, everybody thought so. But me and Teddy got a kick out of Toons. All Toons. We couldn't see the bad in 'em. And when this guy was accused of knockin' over the First National Bank of Toontown, we took his case. But when we looked into it, we found out he did do it after all. We went to his house to take

I'll get it.
Get away from there.

How much is a shave and a haircut, Roger?

Two bits.

I rest my case.
If I don't make it back here by ten...
Yeah?
Yeah?
... I'd head for Cucamonga.
What the hell are you doin' in there?
I followed you to the Maroon Studios. When I heard those shots, I thought I'd help you and investigate the inside of this trunk.
Real good, Rog... but maybe you better let me take over.
Not before I satisfy my sense of moral outrage.
That's not blood. That's ink. That goof Acme squirted me with some the other day. Why it's comin' 'through now, I don't know.
That's because it's Disappearing-Reappearing Ink. Shows up three days later. Gives you enough time to get away from the victim so he doesn't punch you in the nose. Great gag.

Hey, it's the will. I, Marvin Acme, of sound mind and body, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, do hereby bequeath in perpetuity the property known as Toontown to those loveable characters...
No, kid, you're a real hero.
I guess I am at that. Cigar?
By the way, Roger, you were right about your wife. She's a good lady. I'm glad you got her back.
And I'm glad you got your sense of humor back. Think you'll keep it?
And I'm glad you got your sense of humor back. Think you'll keep it?

More than prince of cats. He is the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as you sing prick- song, keeps time, distance, and proportion; he rests his minim rest, one, two, and the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the very first house, of the first and second cause: the immortal passado!

And all this day an unaccustomed spirit lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.

Ah me, how sweet is love itself possessed when but love's shadow's are so rich in joy. News from Verona. How now, Balthasar?! Dost
Juliet!
O, mighty is the powerful grace that lies in plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities: for nought so vile that the earth doth live but to the earth some special good doth give, nor aught so good, but strain'd from that fair use revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse: virtue itself turns vice, being misaplied; and vice sometimes by action dignified.

Sir, a ring my lady bid me give you.

Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed. If that thy bent of love be honourable, Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow, By one that I'll procure to come to thee, Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite; And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay And follow thee my lord throughout the world.

True, I talk of dreams, Which are the children of an idle brain, Begot of nothing but vain fantasy, Which is as thin of substance as the air And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes Even now the frozen bosom of the north, And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence, Turning his face to the dew- dropping south.

If ye should lead her into a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of behavior, as they say: for the lady is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were an ill thing, and very weak dealing.
Bid her to come to confession this afternoon; And there she shall at Father Laurence' cell Be shrived and married.

O, she says nothing sir, but weeps and weeps, and then on Romeo cries and then falls down again.

We weren't real thrilled about it either...
I feel as if I've wandered onto the set of Enter The Dragon. Could you teach me to do that?
I didn't think to see you again tonight. You were pretty pissed.
I didn't think to see you again tonight. You were pretty pissed.
I still am.
I still am.
Is that right?
Is that right?
That's right.
Part of me says I should just look at this as a perk. You know, a bonus. But then I remember you're you -- Deirdre who used to belong to the IRA -- and it occurs to me that deceit and subterfuge come very naturally to you.
Nobody's saying they don't.
Nobody's saying they don't.
And when I consider that, I have to wonder if you don't have some ulterior motive for being here, with me, right now.
And when I consider that, I have to wonder if you don't have some ulterior motive for being here, with me, right now.
I probably do. But for the time being, I'm willing to forget about it...
Look, Sam, don't take it the wrong way when I tell you we won't be doing this again.
You don't have to explain yourself to me, Deirdre.
You don't have to explain yourself to me, Deirdre.
I know I don't have to, Sam, it's just that, for once, I want to. when I was a - Patriot, it was a given I'd sleep with any man it was deemed necessary for me to sleep with. You know: any man who needed setting up. Sometimes so we might blackmail him, sometimes so he could be killed. Sometimes so I could kill

You're a hired gun, Deirdre -- just like me.
You're a hired gun, Deirdre -- just like me.
Exactly. And last night I wanted to be with someone who was just like me.
I better be getting that.
Duty calls?
Duty calls?
Just business.
Now, what did we steal?
I don't know... Well I don't! It's a goddamned mystery to me just like it is to you. But I do know who we're working for. My people, and the Russian mob.
Because if they had she'd be gone along with the package, instead of sitting here with us.
Exactly. Gregor, he was the Russian's man. It was my people came up with the idea for this run, but the Russians who had the capital to finance it. Gregor, he was their insurance, and I was ours. Everybody else was supposed to be neutral. Gregor must've got to Swede...
I bought it for him -- all the stuff he was using, it was in his contract. Cost a nice penny, too, especially that goddamned phone: Gregor had expensive tastes.
Check this out. Gregor's a spook, or he was one until recently. When he was a spy he lived the life -- you know, a prince in some Eastern Bloc country where nobody had shit and Gregor had everything. Then the wall goes down. No more Cold War. And Gregor is out of a job. No apartment, no special stores with Western food and

That we're too stupid to trace his calls.
Well, if it isn't Mr. Interpol himself. I can't believe I misjudged you like I did.
Oh please..you're on some sort of holy mission?
Oh please..you're on some sort of holy mission?
I'm a patriate.
I'm a patriate.
Don't even think that I'm buying that.
Don't even think that I'm buying that.
Where do you get off saying word one? All the time pretending to be one of us, it's the same thing we were doing, Seamus and myself. And here you are so high and mighty, like you're so different from the rest of us.

I didn't say I was.
I didn't say I was.
Bloody fucking hell...
Are you alright?
Alright? It's bloody fucking freezing in here!
Not me. You work too often with the same people and you become friends -- clouds your judgement.
Come off it, Sam -- if we weren't friends already we wouldn't be here now, would we?
Who are you? IRA?
Not likely. Once, yeah, I was -- but there wasn't an inch of profit in it, and I'm a cash oriented girl, if you take my meaning. I'm a hired gun, same as the rest of you, and that's all any of us needs to know about the other.
From here on in you want something you pay cash for it: no credit cards, no bank accounts are in place: ten percent up front, the rest when the job is done. You. What do you do and what should we call you?
These days they they call me Gregor -- and I'm a tech. I do electronic work, surveillance, computer runs.
It's quite satifactory.
Good, because it cost enough. There's cheaper phones by far than that one, man: you better fucking use it.
Good, because it cost enough. There's cheaper phones by far than that one, man: you better fucking use it.
I intend to. This phone is wired like no other: it's got an encryption chip and instant sat-a-link recognition, it can talk to any computer in any language and make it understand. With my custom hardware and this phone I can trace the target's cell phone signature and follow him anywhere he goes...

I'd stake my reputation.
I'd stake my reputation.
But would you stake your life, that's the question...
But would you stake your life, that's the question...
In this business, your life and your reputation are more often than not one and the same.
Now then, let's run through it one more time, shall we? What's your job?
I use my cell phone to get computer access to the telecommunications satellite used by our target. I trace his cell phone signature and use it to pin point his location as he moves through Nice, relaying that information to you.

Next.
Alright, Gregor, I'm...
Ready when you are...
Where's the case?
There's a problem...
That fucking figures...
Should any of you decide to rush me, I'll kill myself and whoever happens to be near me at the time.
Go ahead, shoot... Shoot and kill the bitch, I don't care. And yet you don't shoot. Interesting. Put down your weapon and walk away.
Don't do it, Sam!
Don't do it, Sam!
Shut up!
Shut up!
He'll kill me anway, Sam, shoot though me and kill this fucker.
Yes, Gregor, they sent me.
I'm touched, really, that they'd send someone of your caliber. It's nice to know that they didn't make the mistake of underestimating me twice.
I'm touched, really, that they'd send someone of your caliber. It's nice to know that they didn't make the mistake of underestimating me twice.
That was a mistake, trying to kill you. Mikhi did it without consulting me, I'd have never allowed it.

I'm sure. But I'm sorry to say that it's too late for trust: we have a serious problem.
I'm sure. But I'm sorry to say that it's too late for trust: we have a serious problem.
We'll double your price.

Really? Do you have the money with you?

You first, Edvard.

Perhaps we could both go at the same time...

I think not. After you...
Do you have it?
Not so fast. Who's that?
Not so fast. Who's that?
He's company.
He's company.
Bad company...
Bad company...
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
He's a cop, Vincent, he's French and he's a cop and you better shoot him in the fucking head right now!
Here's yours.
There's been a slight problem.
There's been a slight problem.
What's that?
If you say a word in English, Vincent, my friend with the high powered sporting rifle will shoot you in the throat. Sorry to screw you over like this, but the information you want might get me killed if I give it to you, and that's a price I'm not willing to pay.
I take it you still want the money...
I take it you still want the money...
Of course.
Where's my information?
In here...
In here...
Then you better find it in your heart to tell me, Francois, because while your death is inevitable, it still isn't decided how painful it's going to be.
Sit, sit... Would you like one?
No, Mikhi, I wouldn't. Since I won't speak your language, and you can't speak mine, English will do nicely.
No, Mikhi, I wouldn't. Since I won't speak your language, and you can't speak mine, English will do nicely.
Whatever you wish... This has all been a terrible mistake, Gregor. I wanted to play straight with you, but Edvard insisted we try and kill you.

Edvard said the same thing about you before he died.
Edvard said the same thing about you before he died.
I'm shocked, shocked to think that you'd believe him.
I'm shocked, shocked to think that you'd believe him.
Enough!
And more importantly --
I'll destroy whatever's in the case.
We'll die if we stay here!
You'll die if you leave here.
If you're lying to me you poor excuse for a human being, I'm gonna blow your brains all over this car.
I swear, it has to come here! It has to...
This better be the real thing or you're a dead man!
It is, I'm telling you it is!!
It is, I'm telling you it is!!
You've told me a lot of things, boyo...
What am I doing here? Why, I'm here to see my partners, Gregor, the boys in the Russian Mafia. See, your bosses had hoped to screw me by hiring you to pull your thieving double cross. But they only just found out that what's in the briefcase is completely useless without me. I can't fight them, and they can't kill me -- that means
But you hate each other!
But you hate each other!
What's a little hate between business partners?
So, you've got it all figured, do you?
Figured enough to know there's an odd man out and I'm looking at him.
Figured enough to know there's an odd man out and I'm looking at him.
I think not. I have, of course, taken the precaution of wiring the briefcase to explode five seconds after it opens. Unless, of course, I deactivate it before it goes off.
Whoever hired us.
I got this gig through a contractor. And he most definitely didn't know who was doing the hiring, only that they were paying a lot of money...
So none of us knows who's paying the freight, this is just some anonymous job. For all we know, we're working for different people.
Now that is an interesting proposition.
Don't talk to me unless you tell me what I want to hear, understand?!? You have no choice in this, don't think about winning, think about staying alive. I want the item, and if you don't give it to me, I'm gonna kill you.
I don't have it with me...
I don't have it with me...
Bullshit!
Bullshit!
I swear...
I swear...
Then where is it?
Then where is it?
I sent it to myself in Paris.
I sent it to myself in Paris.
Sent it where?

A post office box.
Is it done?
It's done.
Gregor, is that you?
Much to your disappointment, no doubt.

It was a mistake, it shouldn't have happened.

I'm in the middle of saving you people a great deal of money -- the least you could do is have the decency to pay me!
I'm in the middle of saving you people a great deal of money -- the least you could do is have the decency to pay me!
So what do we do?
So what do we do?
What I do is none of your concern. What you should do is wait for my next phone call. I'm going to find a place where I can tilt the field in my favor. When I'm ready, I'll call you and tell you what I want you to do.
How so?
Because if there's more than one party involved, if we really are working for different people, then perhaps some of us are on different sides. Your orders might be different from mine.
I would imagine that the great satisfaction in all of this will be killing the American.
I hadn't thought about it. Understand me, Gregor -- I take no pleasure in killing. It doesn't bother me one bit, but I don't get off on it.

I need you, Swede, I can't do this without you!

Hello, Jean-Pierre.
Hello, my friend. He doesn't look French to me, Vincent.
He's tough, your American friend.
Yes, Sam's tough alright.
Yes, Sam's tough alright.
And you respect him.
And you respect him.
Of course. Don't you?
Of course. Don't you?
I've never seen a man who could have taken what he just went through. He's a cop?

Not exactly.

How did you know?
How did you know?
If he hadn't you'd have put a bullet in his head a long time ago.
American.
Well, Vincent's American friend, shall we see what we can do for you?
Are you sure you won't have a drink?
No booze...Pain's in the mind, and the mind I can control. Alright, let's do it.
You think you can stitch me up on you own?
Don't worry, we'll take care of it.
Don't worry, we'll take care of it.
Then if you don't mind... I'm gonna pass out.
Some, thanks. Enough to move on, for now.
You should really let a doctor look at that.
You should really let a doctor look at that.
Soon.
Soon.
But first you have something to take care of?

Yeah.
Yeah.
Something important? A thing that cannot wait?

It gets done now or not at all. Another couple of days and the parties concerned are gone where I can't get them.
It gets done now or not at all. Another couple of days and the parties concerned are gone where I can't get them.
Forgive my intrusion into your affairs, but I am the one who connected Vincent to this job, his agent, if you will. He is one of my oldest friends and I owe him a great debt, much like the debt I suspect he owes you.
He sees this differently, as you well know.
I didn't expect that he would.
I didn't expect that he would.
You suffered through an agonizing pain last night, pain you could have avoided by declaring yourself an agent of the law.
You suffered through an agonizing pain last night, pain you could have avoided by declaring yourself an agent of the law.
Vincent told you that I'm a cop?
Vincent told you that I'm a cop?
Not a word. But no ordinary criminal would have the extensive military and medical expertise you do. And so I place the pieces of the puzzle together in a way that makes sense to me. You work for some government agency and you carry a gun, and in my world, that makes you a cop.
So this is what, a test?
Call it a reckoning of character.
If I was healthy, I could take that away from you.
Perhaps. But you are not healthy, and if you try I'll kill you.
So what is it you want to know?
I suppose I want to know how a man like you is created.
I suppose I want to know how a man like you is created.
Created?
Created?
Perhaps forged is a better word. Like steel. Like a sword. You're a modern Samurai. I've spent my life around extraordinary men -- men like Vincent. But I've never seen anyone like you. I'm afraid Vincent will die if he goes with you.

You seem one to me.
You seem one to me.
A Samurai has honor, a Samurai live by the code of Bushido, the way of the warrior. I'm just a killer for hire. The world isn't about honor, anymore. It's about survival.
The point remains: we could be working for different people. There's a chance for one of us... Maybe more than one of us -- has been paid to cross the others. I don't know about you guys, but I like to know who I'm working for. It can help prevent a great deal of... ...unpleasantness.
Anybody tries to unpleasant me I'll put two between his eyes -- one to do the job and the other to make sure it takes.
You shoot alright.
Gets the job done.
Gets the job done.
All in the stomach, though. Your man might live.

Why don't you go do better, then...
Yeah, well... My way works too.
My way is better.
It's a cocktail. Mostly demerol, cut with a little crank because we might need you awake in the real near future.
Fine with fucking me, we got work to do. I don't care what it takes, we are getting our property back and putting it into the hands of the people who are gonna pay us a great deal of money when we do. I don't know about the rest of you guys, but I'm not the kind of guy to just sit back and
What are you gonna do, call him up and ask him to give us back our shit?
Did he bring that with him?
What're you talking about, man? I don't understand.
What a surprise...
What a surprise...
I got a surprise for you, blondie...
They call me Swede.
Who's they?
Who's they?
Everybody.
You should watch what you eat.

I don't particularly like killing, tubby, but I want you to know that this one I'm going to enjoy.
I don't think so.
Sorry I'm late...
What makes you think we're here to meet you?
What makes you think we're here to meet you?
Who else would you be?
Perhaps the police?
I know cops -- and you're no cop.
Cigarette?
No thanks.
He trusts you to lock up?
Let's just say he knows who I am.
I'm Vincent. And I coordinate.
Coordinate what?
Coordinate what?
Things. This is my country, you know.
Where to?
To see a man about a thing.
To see a man about a thing.
I can do that.
Pretty much what you'd expect.
That's what I thought.
He says this is their block.
As in, they own it?

I didn't know that you spoke French.
I didn't know that you spoke French.
I don't. But the language he's speaking is universal.
What'd you say to him?
I asked if we could give him anything else.
That was a nice move you did on our young friend. Judo?
Jujitsu.

Same thing, isn't it?

Not at all. Similar, but not the same.

Help yourself. Since when do you smoke?
I have, I don't know, maybe a cigarette a week.

There is that.
So, Vincent: why bring me along for the ride? Job like this calls for a warm body, somebody who can stand around and look threatening. A tough guy.
Like Larry or Swede.
Like Larry or Swede.
Exactly. Why not bring them?

Let's just say I thought the conversational possibilities were limited. Of course, I might have brought Gregor, but he didn't seem like the right candidate -- for this.

I wanted to see who you were.
I wanted to see who you were.
Who am I?
You were once some kind of special forces. Airborne Ranger, maybe a Navy SEAL. After that you rode shotgun for the CIA in some place like El Salvador or Afghanistan, a real mercenary. Only now -- now you're like the rest of us, it's a very competitive market since the end of the cold war. There's a lot of hired guns out here, and
That's right: there's not hardly enough work these days, nothing that pays the big money, anyhow. Then along comes this job, paying so much goddamned money I couldn't afford not to take it. Somebody's paying through the nose for this.

Lovely, isn't it?
They'd have to keep something like this under lock and key in New York, and it would still get fucked up.
What's going on?
I just wanted to see something.
I just wanted to see something.
See what?
I needed to know.
You need to know a lot of shit, Vincent.
You know, what you pulled back there, that was bullshit.
I needed to see if you were a cop. I'm a popular man with the police, Sam, and whenever they try to catch me they always do it with an inside guy -- some man on some job who seems more trustworthy than all the others put together. And that's the guy you have to watch out for. I hate cops...

Well I ain't a cop.
How did you know?
Know what?
Know what?
That there was a gun pointed at me.

I saw you look off when Francois nodded his head. I figured he wasn't pointing out a particularly rare shrub, and the rest was easy.

Because that's what I would have done...
The question still remains: what do we do now?
Gregor's cell phone...
What's going on?
You weren't around when I woke up, I thought maybe something had happened. This has been one very fucked up job, Sam, and I'm not taking any more chances on anybody... Including you...
I came up here to sneak a smoke.
You were smoking?
You were smoking?
I hope you don't mind I took your pack. It was on the table.
I hope you don't mind I took your pack. It was on the table.
Please, help yourself. Smoke as many you'd like.
I borrowed that, too...
Of course...whenever you feel like it just help yourself.

We live in a singular world, my friend.
We live in a singular world, my friend.
I never really thought I was part of the world you move in, Sam, to tell you the truth. I'm a hood, a thief. Big time in a small time king of way. To the local police I'm a prize, to the local hoods I'm a legend. But to a guy like you I'm just another two bit hired gun.

You might be a hired gun, Vincent, but I got a feeling you cost more than two bits.
He's going back.
Not necessarily. He could go off road at any number of places. He might not even be in the country anymore.

It's Paris. The route's too indirect for anything else. A guy like Gregor, he doesn't waste time on this road unless he has to be on it in the first place. Otherwise, he'd be out of the country by now. He's going to Paris. Now I just hope we can find him before he gets there.
You're a cop...you're a fucking cop...I should kill you.
But you can't.
That makes twice now you've saved my life.
I didn't save your life back there. Risked it, maybe -- but I didn't save shit.

No hospitals. I'll fix this myself if I have to.

Not exactly.

You're with Interpol -- you're a cop.
You're with Interpol -- you're a cop.
If I was a cop, a real cop, I'd have busted you a long time ago. This isn't about you, it's about the job I have to do.
If I was a cop, a real cop, I'd have busted you a long time ago. This isn't about you, it's about the job I have to do.
And what job is that?
And what job is that?
My job, Vincent, a job you don't need to know about. I can't go to the local cops -- they'd never be able to get close enough at this point. It's me or nobody, and I've been on this job too goddamned long not to finish.
It looks to me like we're all that's left of our group.
We? There is no we in my world now, Vincent, just me.
We? There is no we in my world now, Vincent, just me.
I'm going with you.
I'm going with you.
This doesn't involve you, don't you understand? I can't even guarantee you any money out of all this.

It isn't about money for me, not anymore.

You don't have to do this.
You don't have to do this.
Yes I do.
Alright, it's done.
You see the bullet?
You see the bullet?
Clearly.
Clearly.
Good. Now take the forceps, and remember, Vincent, what we're doing here is routine. I've done stuff like this at least twenty times in the field. There are no vital organs where you're working, no major muscles or arteries -- you can't kill me. Just make sure you've got the bullet before you try to pull it out.
You know him?
I know of him.
The Irish representative?
Yes.
What's this?
The address of the Russian production company. Just in case we need to find them.
The address of the Russian production company. Just in case we need to find them.
Thorough man.
You sure your friend got the right place?
If Tony says this is it, then it's it.
Tell me, Sam: why do you do this?
Do what?
Do what?
Continue when it would be so much easier to give it up.

It's my job.

Then quit. You don't work for Interpol, Sam.

Sure I do. You heard him, you heard the guy -- that's what he said, what Edvard said.
Sure I do. You heard him, you heard the guy -- that's what he said, what Edvard said.
It's a cover, then. A cover within a cover, a feint within a feint. You work for the CIA, it's the only possible answer.
I'm a field agent -- last of an already extinct breed. I do dark ops.
Dark ops?
Dark ops?
Dark operations. Wet work. Kidnaping. Assassination.

Very ugly.

I was waiting to see what would happen. I didn't want to kill him if I didn't have to.
I was waiting to see what would happen. I didn't want to kill him if I didn't have to.
You would have done that?
You would have done that?
I would have tried not to. But yes, if it would have kept him from shooting you, I would have.
I would have tried not to. But yes, if it would have kept him from shooting you, I would have.
How could you have done that?
How could you have done that?
Because I owe you. Look at that...
They don't have the package.
You think?
You think?
You said it yourself: Gregor's not dead. If they had the package, they'd have killed him.
What the fuck happened?
I don't know...
I don't know...
You don't know? Bullshit, you had her, there was no way out.
Give me a cigarette.
Right now?
Right now?
Gimme a goddamn cigarette!!!!
Gimme a goddamn cigarette!!!!
Why are you driving? You're not French, you don't live here, you don't know these roads. Why are you driving?
I'm not here very much.
Business keeps you on the road?
Business keeps you on the road?
Something like that.
I know I don't need to say this to you, but I need to say it to you. This is my job, I have to do it.
So I do it.
So I do it.
No you don't, and you know it.
No you don't, and you know it.
If our positions were reversed, would you leave me?
If our positions were reversed, would you leave me?
In a minute.
In a minute.
I think not.
Do we need anything else?
Yeah. We need out fucking heads examined.
Not here. They might see it.
If I'm going to die for the CIA, I'm going to go out smoking. Besides, there's half a forest between us and them, they can't see a goddamned thing.
Time to quit.
Just like that?
Just like that?
Not just like that... Just before I turn around and it's six months from now and the first thing I do when I wake up in the morning is light a cigarette.

Would you stop with that...
Would you stop with that...
Why? You've got more force of will than anyone I've ever seen. You handle a gun like it's a part of you, you perform surgery on yourself without anesthesia... And most amazing of all, you quit smoking, just like that.

The mark of a true Samurai. What I do for the Company, Vincent, is no different than what you do. We're both hired guns, and this is a job -- like any other job.

Why then, Sam, don't you act like this is a job like any other? Surely, if you are a hired gun, you realize that some times you just have to walk away without getting what you came for.

Closest and oldest.
Closest and oldest.
And yet you would have killed him to save my life. You have a sense of honor, Vincent, that I can't even remember anymore. I don't know that I ever even had it to begin with. All I know to do, Vincent, is to finish my job.

No, I don't.
You have to stop doing that!
I'll work on it...
Let's get him out of here...
Finish the job...

Finish it!
You son-of-a-bitch...
What?
What?
You speak French.

What of it?

Nothing...
"Your field dressing saved his life." That's three I owe you.
You don't owe me a goddamned thing, Vincent, and you know it. You stepped in front of a bullet for me. I owe you a heavy debt.

Tell me something first. The package: what was it?
Tell me something first. The package: what was it?
I don't know. Nobody knows, except a bunch of people who are too dead to tell us. There's probably a couple of guys back at the Company who know, but I don't think they plan to tell me anytime soon.

What happened to it?
What happened to it?
Gone. Destroyed.
Gone. Destroyed.
I guess that's for the best.
I told you, I quit.
Just to keep me company, Sam -- I hate smoking alone. How about you? I thought all you IRA types smoked.
What's the story?
It's an international thing. Several different peoples involved, criminals from all over the world, experts brought together to do a job. But maybe the most interesting thing about it is that preeminent in the plot we find the Russian Mob and the IRA in bed together. An unlikely group of partners.
Gaelic.
You sure?
You sure?
I'm sure.
Why's that?
Cause the Russian production company would be easier to find.

It's the Irish tape we want.
It's the Irish tape we want.
Gonna be tough.
Last I heard there was a film rep for the Irish players staying at this address, name of Seamus Reilly.
Seamus Reilly.
Why didn't you kill her?
Why didn't you kill him?
You slept with her!
How is it these fellahs managed to get the drop on us?
You slept with her!
You should have kill him when you had the chance. But no...

Doing well. This is?

A friend. I was telling him about how you always have the latest tapes.
A friend. I was telling him about how you always have the latest tapes.
Why don't we step into my office...
I was wondering if you had any movies that were particularly new.
Matter of face there's this flick I've been hearing about. I haven't seen it, but from what I hear it's pretty cool.
Do you have the tape?
I might know where you could get a copy.
What I've heard so far, it's all a lot of talk. I wasn't so sure what to make of it at first, cause, like I said, the Irish and the Russians are an unlikely mix.
You said you might know where we can get a copy of this tape?
You said you might know where we can get a copy of this tape?
All depends on whether you want the Russian or the Gaelic language version.
Can you get it?
The Russian would be easier.
Seamus Reilly, boy's a serious Irish Auteur -- a real firebrand. Thinks his more moderate filmmaking brethren have turned to making movies for peace-loving pussies, if you see what I'm saying.
I get the picture.
Tony and I have to talk some business, first.
I gotta try and overcharge him, he has to moan about the price, we settle somewhere in the middle.
I gotta try and overcharge him, he has to moan about the price, we settle somewhere in the middle.
It's a matter of respect. Why don't you wait outside, this won't take long.
Sort of!
Hey Dwayne why don't you introduce him to your funeral parlor cousin?
What the hell happened here?
Looks like some kind of drug deal or something, they're not from around here -- one of them's still alive.
I'd like to know what they were doing in my town! Did you get ID off any of them?
None of them had any --
Damn.
I want to get some hounds down here.
Whatsamatter with you? Aren't you concerned about all of this?
I can't get enough of it.
I should kill you right here! I never thought you'd do this to me but I guess there's a lot I didn't know about you!
Dwayne listen to me -
Dwayne listen to me -
Shut up! Not another word out of you! You're going down, the Feds know all about it! You didn't know some of it was marked, did you! Where's the rest?
Shut up! Not another word out of you! You're going down, the Feds know all about it! You didn't know some of it was marked, did you! Where's the rest?
I don't know what you're -
I don't know what you're -
Don't lie to me!!!!
Ready to roll, partner?
Sure thing, and --
Don't spend it all in one place.
I knew you'd come through. Jesse observes the transaction Booth and Earl start to leave.
How old is Otis anyhow, thirty?
The horniest dog in Nevada.
Thanks for the loan, man. I'll have it in a few days, I promise.
Well I hope so. That pretty much cleaned me out.

I would have asked my sister, but its better to leave family out, always leads to trouble.
I hear you.
Yeah...I remember my brother-in-law Gary, the wheel watcher. He finally got on the show and won seven thousand dollars! Plus some leather furniture. Do you think I saw any of that? His excuse was the government got it all.
Seven thousand...
Seven thousand...
He would have won more but he blew it at the end. Didn't know what Cash and Carry was.

Oh, you would have done great.

I probably would have. I guess the clues damn near before everyone.
I probably would have. I guess the clues damn near before everyone.
That's what everyone thinks. But according to him, when it's the real thing, it's quite an intimidatin' environment in which to concentrate.
What the hell...
They're out of towners... Arizona plates...
Ten thousand right here.
There must be over a million dollars in here.
There must be over a million dollars in here.
Shit, more than that.
What are we going to do?
What do you mean what are we going to do?
What do you mean what are we going to do?
I mean -- Earl grabs Booth's arm --
Call it in I guess. Why?
Why? Are you kidding me?
No. We can't.
Look around you partner! You said yourself you never saw anything like it.

Come on Booth! Look at these scumbags around us. Who's going to know what happened! Let's take it and get out of here!

Well someone's gonna find them.

Hell, it won't be us!
It won't work.
Why?
Why?
I told Trudy we were coming down this way, that's why!
I told Trudy we were coming down this way, that's why!
We'll figure something out.
We would never have to worry about money -- ever again, Jesus!
Suppose someone knows about the money? They're bound to ask questions.
Suppose someone knows about the money? They're bound to ask questions.
Who's going to question us? Dwayne? Jesse?

It's going to go bigger than that. Could you stare someone straight in the face and lie about it?

I'll worry about that when it happens and if it happens, and it's not gonna happen!
I'll worry about that when it happens and if it happens, and it's not gonna happen!
What makes you so sure?
What makes you so sure?
Because...I know.
It's no accident we stumbled on this money. It's an answer to a prayer! Every night and every day I've prayed that God would just -- help me out a little, give me a little push. Tonight my prayer came true.
Oh so God's like Western Union and he just dropped us a couple million bucks?
Oh so God's like Western Union and he just dropped us a couple million bucks?
That's right!
That's right!
At the expense of six people.
At the expense of six people.
They killed themselves. Besides, they were breaking the law. What they were doing was wrong! Whatsamatter Booth, don't you believe in miracles?
All right hold on! Lemme think... Shit, did you touch the car?
Maybe. Who cares?
I do. It's little shit like that sends people to jail! We have to cover all the bases if we're going to pull this!
All right we will.
We'll torch the bases, how's that?
Torch it?!
We'll leave a few packets in the trunk, and stash the rest somewhere else. Car went up in the gunfight.
I don't know.
I've got one condition.
What's that?
We're going to be patient. If we start flashing money around, buying fancy cars and fancy clothes, people are going to ask questions.
Well, we won't do any of that shit!
Shhh!
What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do?
Well, I don't know. I'm putting it out of my mind and you should too --
I don't know! Son of a bitch! Who the hell are you?
He saw everything!
How long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? Answer me!
He'll tell them everything to save his ass. That's how they all work it!
I'm not letting some gangbanger send me to jail. We can't risk it.
What are you thinking?
I don't know...
You're thinking about killing him. I can't do that. No way. I've never killed a man. Never even shot at one...
You're thinking about killing him. I can't do that. No way. I've never killed a man. Never even shot at one...
Well neither have I, but it's us or him. If he talks, or writes a note, or whatever, he's gonna turn us in. Besides, he's a low life scumbag. His kind is hardly even human anyway.

I...I can't do that.
Okay then. I'll do it.
Okay then. I'll do it.
That's not what I mean.
That's not what I mean.
Listen. Do you want to go to jail? Taking evidence, tampering with a crime scene. You know what they'd do.
I tell you it was a miracle the way things turned out --
I don't want to hear about miracles and God and all that! We tried to murder someone to cover our asses!
I don't want to hear about miracles and God and all that! We tried to murder someone to cover our asses!
Well we didn't kill him, he died on his own.
Look. Dwayne was right. This is going to be a big story. So big in fact that I don't want to even have this money around.
Fair enough, I'll take it to my place.
Fair enough, I'll take it to my place.
Forget it. We're going to bury it, and we're not going to even think about it until everything dies down. And no one, I mean no one hears a word about it. Understand?
We're dead. We're dead, We are dead... What are we going to do?!
I don't know...
I don't know...
This isn't a joke. What are we going to do!
I don't know you want me to put on my cape and fly there?! We're going to play it cool... besides there might be nothing on that tape anyway...
That guy was a Federal agent. An officer of the law, just like us.
That guy was a Federal agent. An officer of the law, just like us.
Well, we didn't know that at the time.

We assaulted a Federal agent. We killed him.

No we didn't. He died on his own.
No we didn't. He died on his own.
Oh, right, with a little help from his pals Booth and Earl. I'm sure that's gonna fly real far when they hear that tape...
We gotta turn ourselves in, before they hear the tape.
Are you nuts? They'll fry us for sure. There's no way we're doin' that, you understand? No way.
Are you nuts? They'll fry us for sure. There's no way we're doin' that, you understand? No way.
It's the right thing to do.
It's the right thing to do.
It's the stupid thing to do, that's what it is.
I should have known something like this was going to happen!
Man take it easy! You're sweating like crazy!
How long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? Answer me!
He'll tell them everything to save his ass. That's how they all work it!
Shit! We're gonna have to get rid of him. I'm not letting some gangbanger ruin my life. We can't risk it.
What are you thinking?

Listen. Do you want to go to jail? Taking evidence, tampering with a crime scene. You know what they'd do.
He would have done it to us, right?
He would have done it to us, right?
Exactly. This is our little secret, partner.
I could kill that no good son of a bitch!
All right enough! I'm tired of thinking about all this!
All right enough! I'm tired of thinking about all this!
Well I'm not! Thinks he's got us by the balls.
Well I'm not! Thinks he's got us by the balls.
Well doesn't he? Besides if the DEA heard that tape we'd be behind bars right now. Just call it the cost of doing business. This whole thing is screwed up. I'm thinking. Maybe we should tell 'em the truth...
...Or get rid of the money. I don't know.
I've got a better idea. All we have to do is straighten out Jesse.
I've got a better idea. All we have to do is straighten out Jesse.
And how do you figure we do that?

All we have to do is get our hands on the original tape. We'll set him up somehow.

He's probably made copies. He's not going to give them up to us.
He's probably made copies. He's not going to give them up to us.
Forget the copies! He could have made up the copies -- the only thing that incriminates us is the original.
He's going to be trouble.
He's a partner now, Earl, like it or not.
We had a deal! What was I, talking to the wall?
For Christ's sake, Booth, I just needed to take care of a few debts is all! You got my word on it --I'm not going near it again until everything cools down.
You said that last time!
Well I mean it this time. Come on. Let's get this over with!
You're out of your mind.
Yeah, I mean you're coming unglued, Jesse.
You think he's bluffing?
No.
No.
Neither do I.
Look, Earl. We gotta go straight. This is all messed up...
If you're any friend at all, you'll stop talking like that!
If you're any friend at all, you'll stop talking like that!
Maybe we can reason with Jesse, give him a third in exchange for the tape.
Maybe we can reason with Jesse, give him a third in exchange for the tape.
I don't think he's going to be doing any bargaining with us, the stupid son-of-a-bitch! Besides, I'm not giving him a third of anything, not after everything we had to do.
I don't think he's going to be doing any bargaining with us, the stupid son-of-a-bitch! Besides, I'm not giving him a third of anything, not after everything we had to do.
Well what are we supposed to do?
Well what are we supposed to do?
I don't know...we have to shut him up somehow. Booth looks at Earl --
You're crazy.
How badly do you want that money?! How bad do you want to stay out of jail?
How badly do you want that money?! How bad do you want to stay out of jail?
Not bad enough to kill him.
Not bad enough to kill him.
Who said anything about killing? Just keep driving straight...
How long is it going to take?!
I don't know! Shit, give me a break!
What are you thinking? We were only supposed to scare him!
I'm just making our intentions clear. Go check the desk.
Here it is.
There it is...now what about the others?
Even if we have the tape, that wouldn't shut him up!
You killed him...
You killed him...
It's gonna be o.k.
It's gonna be o.k.
Like hell it is. This is Jesse! Jesse!
Jesus Christ Earl...what are we doing?...
We're doing what we gotta do, to protect ourselves!
We're doing what we gotta do, to protect ourselves!
You don't know if he was really gonna --
You don't know if he was really gonna --
Yes I DO! It never woulda stopped, you know that. Jesse's always gonna be making mistakes and we'd be paying for them for the rest of our lives.
Maybe we should say somethin'.
Come on. Booth grabs the bag --
Come on. Booth grabs the bag --
Do you have everything?
Do you have everything?
I sure as hell hope so. Let's go.
I don't know for sure, but why else would they head for the bank?
It was all used. Random numbers. How can they trace it?

No we're not.
We're not? How do you figure that?
We'll take the money and disappear! We can do it, spend it on the move. Even if all of it's marked, there's ways around it.
We'll take the money and disappear! We can do it, spend it on the move. Even if all of it's marked, there's ways around it.
We've got to go now, then.
We've got to go now, then.
That's right.
That's right.
Then Sally comes too.
Oh Jesus...
He killed her...he killed her...
He killed her...he killed her...
What happened? What's Earl doing here?
What happened? What's Earl doing here?
He found us, he shot her...he killed her...
He found us, he shot her...he killed her...
Booth, listen to me...Booth!
Booth, listen to me...Booth!
He killed her...
We got to get out of here. Do you understand? We got to get out of here right now!
No. It stops now. It stops here.
No. It stops now. It stops here.
What do you mean? Look. We can make still make it work.
Dwayne's dead.
I know, I know. Dwayne's dead, but we can deal with it. We'll pin it on him. The DEA was driving Jesse's car. No car phone. No radio. They couldn't have called me in.
What are you talking about?
Dwayne had the opportunity, just like us. He was at the scene. He grabbed the cash. Of course. This is perfect!
It's too late...
It's NOT too late!
It's NOT too late!
Yes it is. I'm calling it in. Right now.
You're the one who's nuts! There's no one left to touch us, Booth. We're home free! We just plant a little of the money on Dwayne, and it's all ours.
It's not about the money anymore. Can't you see that? It's about
Just one more. This one knocks off all the rest.
I can't. I can't go on. I can't keep lying...killing. That's not me. That's not US.
That'll bring me down, too. Eventually. You gotta know that.
Uh huh.
Uh huh.
And you're solid on that?
And you're solid on that?
Rock solid.
You gentlemen look like you're about to toss your collective cookies.
Why don't you get to the point.
Why don't you get to the point.
My point, well...
Listen Earl. I covered for you. For both of you. I put my ass on the line to save yours, so don't pull a hostile tone with me!
What's your offer, Jesse?
What's your offer, Jesse?
My offer? Well I'd say it's a fair one, like I said we're friends. All I want is my share, which I guess is...
Besides, I'm not stupid, Earl. The tape was a basic Maxell D-80. You can buy 'em at any store. There's no way they can pin anything on me.
All right, Jesse, we'll play it your way, under one condition.
All right, Jesse, we'll play it your way, under one condition.
I'm all ears.
I'm all ears.
We're going to wait. All of us, until everything dies down.
Well, I don't know...
That's the deal. If you don't like it, forget it, no one wins.
Ok...I'll wait. For now. But I'm going to need a little advance, to oil the wheels, so to speak.
How much?
How much?
I understand your logic, Booth, but I don't think...two thousand's going to raise any eyebrows, do you?
I understand your logic, Booth, but I don't think...two thousand's going to raise any eyebrows, do you?
Two thousand...
Two thousand...
By Friday.
There's going to have to be a change in our arrangement.
What are you proposing?
What are you proposing?
I want my share. All of it.
I don't like getting grilled by that DEA bitch, I don't like taking that kind of heat!
None of us like it!
None of us like it!
Well I don't know what's going to happen next -- she's pressing this, another interrogation, another problem.
Well I don't know what's going to happen next -- she's pressing this, another interrogation, another problem.
Just take it in stride.
Just take it in stride.
I'm not gonna take -- I'm not gonna take it in stride. I had a good run turn to shit on me like that - cleaned me out.
I was beginning to think you weren't going to show. That can't be all of it.
No. It's not.
You don't expect us to believe that do you?
You better believe it if you know what's good for you!
Come on, Booth. Don't let him do this!!!
Don't have much choice, Jesse. You saw to that!
Don't have much choice, Jesse. You saw to that!
You're only screwing yourselves over! Helllllp! HELLLLLP! SOMEBODY!!!
You're only screwing yourselves over! Helllllp! HELLLLLP! SOMEBODY!!!
Shut up, Jesse.
Shut up, Jesse.
HELLLLLP!!!!
Whoa, Earl!
OKAY! IT'S UNDER MY DESK!! TAPED TO THE BOTTOM SIDE!!!
OKAY! IT'S UNDER MY DESK!! TAPED TO THE BOTTOM SIDE!!!
What are you doing, Earl?
How are ya?
Hello.
Thank you. Now, do you remember seeing any vehicles traveling near the site, on your way to or from?
No. Why?
No. Why?
Because someone may have gotten away.
Could it have been in the Mercedes?
Maybe. That's where it was during Denning's last report.
Normally we would have tracked him with a wiretap, but it was standard for him to occasionally drop out when working with these guys. The last we heard from him was two days ago.
You mean that guy was an agent?
You mean that guy was an agent?
Yes. Wife and a kid. Don't blame yourself, Deputy. You did all you could. You have our deepest gratitude...and my personal thanks.
Well, we have one lead and that's what I'm looking into next.
What's that?
What's that?
Denning was wearing a bug.
Yeah? So?
It's odd. I don't know how Denning had the time, or the ability to buy something local, based on his situation.
I have to go to the bank before it closes.
What for?
What for?
I gotta take some money out, that's what for.
There's an ATM on Speedwell Avenue.
Yeah but I need to take out four hundred dollars and the ATM will only give me three.
Well, not that I wouldn't sugar bun but Earl's in a bind. They're going to take his car.
He's irresponsible.
Ah hell, he'd do the same for me.
Has he?
Has he?
No. But he would, probably.
Get a room in a nice hotel for a few hours...
I might have to look into that...
Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
Heard you had quite a night.
Yeah.
It was all over the local news. Dwayne was there, acting all official.
It was all over the local news. Dwayne was there, acting all official.
I know.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Nothing.
Nothing's wrong.
Nothing's wrong.
Oh. You coming by tonight?
Oh. You coming by tonight?
OK.
OK.
Are you sure you're OK?
Are you sure you're OK?
Yeah I'm fine.
Yeah I'm fine.
I'm just tired is all. I'll see you tonight OK baby?
I'm just tired is all. I'll see you tonight OK baby?
OK. I love you.
OK. I love you.
I love you too.
Sally? I was beginning to think he wasn't gonna leave.
I'm in here.
You got me something? What's the occasion?
You deserve it is the occasion.
What happened to your cheek? SALLY Oh I...nothing...
Nothing happened?
Nothing happened?
Dwayne got a little tipsy is all. He doesn't handle pressure well. It's over.
Like hell it's over. You told me he wasn't doing this anymore.
He's not, he's...
He's not, he's...
That son of a bitch.
That son of a bitch.
Booth. Don't. It's nothing. It's not worth it. Remember what happened the last time?
Let's not get into this again. I know him. If you said something, he'd take it out on me.
And I'd take it out on him.
And I'd take it out on him.
And I'd end up a widow in two ways. Let's forget it. I'll just be a little more careful next time.
And I'd end up a widow in two ways. Let's forget it. I'll just be a little more careful next time.
There isn't gonna be a next time. We're gonna get out of here.
You're worth every last penny.
Well, I can't let you down now, can I?
I told him I bought the lingerie, as a surprise. I don't think he suspects anything, but now you know, if he mentions it.
How the hell did he find it?
How the hell did he find it?
He started digging through my closet, something he never does.
He started digging through my closet, something he never does.
Great...
Great...
It's OK, Booth, it's no big deal.
It's OK, Booth, it's no big deal.
Let's hope so. SALLY If he asks me again, I'm gonna tell him I returned it all.
Let's hope so. SALLY If he asks me again, I'm gonna tell him I returned it all.
Dammit, I'm so sick of this.
Dammit, I'm so sick of this.
I know.
I know.
Every night I think about you sleeping with him, him slobbering all over you.
Every night I think about you sleeping with him, him slobbering all over you.
He doesn't slobber, he just snores. And I told you we haven't...done anything in over a year.
He doesn't slobber, he just snores. And I told you we haven't...done anything in over a year.
It doesn't matter...he's next to you. You know, I always say to myself, you should have left him years ago. Why didn't you?
It doesn't matter...he's next to you. You know, I always say to myself, you should have left him years ago. Why didn't you?
I used to think he was something, once... I was eighteen, I didn't know any better, and he had something steady to offer.
Let's just get out of here, get out of this -- place. We'll drop out, get a house have some kids, get a satellite dish...
I hate it when you talk like this. Go on.
I hate it when you talk like this. Go on.
We'd... I don't know...go to California, New York, maybe a house on a Swiss mountainside...
We'd... I don't know...go to California, New York, maybe a house on a Swiss mountainside...
It'd have to be Switzerland to make sure Dwayne never finds us.
So do I.
I love you Sally.
I love you Sally.
I love you.
A satellite dish?
Well I was just throwing out ideas...
How are we going to do all this?
I'm going to quit. That's what has to happen first. Then we're going to tell him.
I'm going to quit. That's what has to happen first. Then we're going to tell him.
I don't know, Booth.
I don't know, Booth.
I'll be there for you. He won't try anything while I'm there. I promise. I'll protect you.
When do you expect this inheritance stuff to be straightened out?
Shouldn't be long. A couple of weeks maybe.
Shouldn't be long. A couple of weeks maybe.
Can you rely on how much they said you'd get?
Can you rely on how much they said you'd get?
It'll be more than enough. We can get out of here...
Why does that bother you?
I'm not sure why. It's just, I've never been anywhere else...
I'm not sure why. It's just, I've never been anywhere else...
Sally there's a whole world out there. We can have a new home. A real home, not some tin-plated dump. What are you giving up?
Sally there's a whole world out there. We can have a new home. A real home, not some tin-plated dump. What are you giving up?
I don't know. My friends...
I don't know. My friends...
We'll meet new people. You might have friends out there you never met.
We'll meet new people. You might have friends out there you never met.
Yeah, I guess you're right. It's just...all so sudden...
Yeah, I guess you're right. It's just...all so sudden...
Yeah, it is...
Do you wanna tell me what that was all about?
Yeah. I want to tell you everything.
Things just got a little screwed up, that's all.
I don't believe it.
I don't believe it.
I swear to you, it's true...
Sally, do you love me?
You know I do.
Yeah, I've seen him.
What did he buy?
What did he buy?
I don't remember. We get a lot of people in here.
I don't remember. We get a lot of people in here.
Could it have been this?
Be more specific. A month, a week...
A week ago, at most.
A week ago, at most.
Thanks for your time.
Test the product?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Sounds like you don't trust me.
Business is business. Now where the hell is it? I wanna get out of here. That's the plan, we're just flunkies, you know what I'm saying?
You didn't answer my question. Are you saying my word is of no value to you?
You didn't answer my question. Are you saying my word is of no value to you?
You said that, I didn't.
I have a better plan. You want to hear it?
What?
What?
I have a better plan.
And what's that?
How about you give us what you have and leave.
How about you give us what you have and leave.
What?
What?
Am I speaking English here? How-about-you-give-us-what-you- have-and-leave?
What is this? Don't be stupid man...
First you question my integrity, then you call me stupid... ...that hurts, son.
All right, deputies, take care, don't let your meat loaf.
Don't worry the real men are in charge now.
Don't worry the real men are in charge now.
Speaking of which that reminds me I have to bring something home or eat Sally's meatloaf again, and I don't think I could stand that.
Why?
Cause we got footprints leading into that brush, I want to see where it leads... Jesus, seven dead. I'll tell you I've never seen carnage like this in all my seventeen years of sheriffing these parts. I don't like it. Not in my jurisdiction.
What makes you say that?
We had hounds down at the scene, the footprint trail was a bust. And there were no other tire tracks in the vicinity.
I don't know.
This just might be our ticket!
What do you think about all this?
Hell, I don't know. If I had some input I'd offer it up.
I guess we can get started.
I wanted to ask you some questions about last night.
He kept a recording of all such transactions in order to keep track of who's who, what was said, what's happening. I contacted your local coroner, and he found it taped to his back.
That's news to me. So it's over at Jesse's office?
That's news to me. So it's over at Jesse's office?
Yeah. I told him I'd be there before five.
Yeah. I told him I'd be there before five.
Excellent. I'll go down with you.
Well nothing audible to us. Maybe the lab can pick something up.
Damn! MARTIN I'm sorry to have dragged you all the way down here for that. I thought maybe it would help. Booth lets out an inaudible deep breath -- Earl immediately plays up to Martin, clearly relieved --
Well we'd like to help you in any way we can. We're all in this together, as law enforcement officers.
We appreciate that.
Uh, no...
Don't you think I would have told you that!
Maybe. Maybe not.
What are you getting at?
What are you getting at?
Well, unfortunately Denning's not here to tell us, but I would say someone got their hands on that tape and switched it.
Well, unfortunately Denning's not here to tell us, but I would say someone got their hands on that tape and switched it.
Why would someone do that?
Why would someone do that?
Because they don't want anyone to hear what's on it, obviously.
Oh that was Agent Wallace. We're going to check into something.
Maybe I should come along.
Don't you have to be here?
Hell no. besides I'm just a radio call away if something happens. I feel I should keep abreast of what happens, seeing it's my jurisdiction and all.
Hell no. besides I'm just a radio call away if something happens. I feel I should keep abreast of what happens, seeing it's my jurisdiction and all.
Mm-hmm...
We don't know. Whoever got this payload together has one hell of a laundering system.
Have you known this all along?
Have you known this all along?
Well you can understand why we didn't say anything. If word got out that we had a track on the money it would only work against us.
Well you can understand why we didn't say anything. If word got out that we had a track on the money it would only work against us.
Well yes I understand that, we don't want them high-tailing it out of here.
Sheriff Hogan --
Dwayne.
Dwayne.
Dwayne... It is imperative that we keep this confidential. Now we know someone's out there. Very close. It may even be the son of a bitch that killed my partner.
Dwayne... It is imperative that we keep this confidential. Now we know someone's out there. Very close. It may even be the son of a bitch that killed my partner.
Fine. The information doesn't leave this room.
OK...this is good. Our first solid lead.
Did you say After Midnight?
Mr. Curtis called us this afternoon. The bills arrived at this branch from a cash drop. Came through a store called After Midnight. There's only four employees, none of them can tell us who passed them.
Is this marked money, or what?
Some of it. Denning only handled a small portion of the total, but it looks like this was one of his bills.
So there was money there! Who the hell's money is it?!
Yeah.
What the hell is that, some kind of porno store or something?
What the hell is that, some kind of porno store or something?
Not exactly. It's some lingerie store on the strip.

Lingerie...

Anything...specific?

Well I don't know...

Well...I should have done a little homework, getting all the sizes, and what not.
Sure.
Sure.
I'm just not very good...with all of this stuff.
I'm just not very good...with all of this stuff.
Oh, that's ok, a lot of men feel uncomfortable when they come in here.
Oh, that's ok, a lot of men feel uncomfortable when they come in here.
A lot of men come in here?
A lot of men come in here?
Oh yeah. Between here and Vegas we get a lot of customers. All types. Even had an officer, just like you.
Just goes to show you.
I mean at least pick a more discreet place, the scalp, under the armpit, under the tongue, someplace where the trained eye wont immediately look.
Damn its hot in here...
He probably figured she was on her way out anyhow, no drugs in her system, no foul play.
Very clumsy, very clumsy. Id have found it in a minute.
All right youre the super sleuth, what do you want, a medal?
All right youre the super sleuth, what do you want, a medal?
No. But what I would like is the forty dollars you owe me, and Im a busy man.
No. But what I would like is the forty dollars you owe me, and Im a busy man.
Dammit youre persistent. I dont want to listen to this anymore. No more bets with you.
Aw, now thats gonna take time to clear!
Take it or leave it.
Do you even have a girlfriend, Jesse?
Sort of.
She's not his type.
Yeah. That's all I need, to become one of your in-laws.
Jesse?
Yeah whaddya want?.
I'm at a payphone in Vegas. What's up?
Vegas! Can you hightail it back here by three o'clock?
Vegas! Can you hightail it back here by three o'clock?
Why?

Well, we got the DEA coming down here again, I don't know, sounds to me like they got some more questions they want to ask us.
About what?
About what?
Well they really didn't go into any details on the phone, but they did ask for you, and I figure we should try to help them out as best we can.
Well they really didn't go into any details on the phone, but they did ask for you, and I figure we should try to help them out as best we can.

I have complete faith in you. But don't you go speeding.
Yeah...see you at three.
Nice of you to join us. I did say three o'clock, didn't I?
Well I'm here now.
Something wrong, Jesse?
No. Something wrong with you Dwayne?
No. Something wrong with you Dwayne?
You walked in here looking like you just ate a shit sandwich.
You walked in here looking like you just ate a shit sandwich.
Well, I just got a lot of things on my mind is all.
What's this?
I don't know...
Hey where's the hot pad?

Where's the hot back -- the therapeutic pad thing?
Where's the hot back -- the therapeutic pad thing?
I can't hear a word you're saying!
I can't hear a word you're saying!
Forget it.
It was going to be a surprise!
A surprise huh? Well I don't like any surprises, especially if I'm forking over the loot for them!
What are you saying?
I'm saying you're about as romantic as a bag of sand.
I'm saying you're about as romantic as a bag of sand.
Watch that. Watch that tone.
Nothing. Nothing's the matter. SALLY Aren't you going to tell how your day went?
Not much to tell. Nothing really happened.

That hasn't stopped you before.
Suppose I'm not exciting enough for you.
I didn't say that. You did.

Well you might as well say it. Mister Small Time...
Well you might as well say it. Mister Small Time...
Just trying to be civil Dwayne.
Don't you want to hear about my day?
Yeah let's hear about your day.
Yeah let's hear about your day.
Well I got the tires rotated, I went shopping, and I made dinner.
Whatever...
Look I worked all day, I'm tired as hell and I want to sit and eat in peace! Is that asking too much?
No, Dwayne, you go ahead and relax, have a six pack and fall asleep in front of the TV, and come upstairs and pass out. And do it all over again tomorrow!
Save me the sermon. I've heard it all before, it's boring.
Save me the sermon. I've heard it all before, it's boring.
It certainly is...
You shut your mouth you son of a bitch!
Dwayne put the gun down --

Shut up!!! Slut!!!
You'd do this to me?!
Dwayne -
Dwayne -
You'd do this to me!
Dwayne please calm down!
Calm down --
Hey we're all friends, right? Friends don't squeal on friends, that's not what Jesse Segundo is all about.
Then what the hell are you all about?
I'll settle for a third of that.
And if we refuse? Your tampering with evidence isn't exactly a misdemeanor, did you ever consider that?
And if we refuse? Your tampering with evidence isn't exactly a misdemeanor, did you ever consider that?
True, but neither is attempted murder. In fact I'd say that's considerably worse, wouldn't you, Earl?
We're out of here.
Right behind you.
Meet me at the Tumbleweed Diner.
What?
What?
Just do it! Meet me there, now.
I'm not asking.
Well you're not getting, either.
Well you're not getting, either.
Listen -
What do you mean? You gambled it?
I was on a roll! Im a little overextended now.

Oh Jesus Christ...
Oh Jesus Christ...
So I want the money and I want it now.
So I want the money and I want it now.
Well you can't have it.
You want to see how more unglued I can get? Try me.
You're never getting that much.
You're never getting that much.
I think I am.
What the hell are you doing, you crazy some bitches --
We're gonna talk.
I don't suppose you'll tell us where the tape is.
Well it's not here -- you're wasting your time and you're pissing me off!
Don't hurt me.
We gotta, Jesse. It's tough, but you didn't leave us any choice. We gotta know where the tapes are.
Easy to purchase, hard to detect. Too much potassium can kill a man. Just have to...pick a discreet spot.
Stop! Stop! I don't need the money. You can have it all.
Hi ma.
Hi.
I didn't know you were coming.
I was in the neighborhood.
I was in the neighborhood.
Is that the mail?
Is that the mail?
Yeah.
How's work?
Well, same ol' same ol'.
People have been asking me about that story in the paper. I told them you were the first person on the scene. They were asking me for all the details.
It was pretty gory ma, let me tell you. But you have to turn all that off, and do your job, just like pop used to say.
It was pretty gory ma, let me tell you. But you have to turn all that off, and do your job, just like pop used to say.

There was this raffle going on at the station, some charity or church was running it, I forget, so I figure what the hell put in my five bucks...
And what happened?
And what happened?
Well basically I forgot about it, you know, you never win these things, but this time, well...

Yep, fifteen thousand BTU's, enough to cool off this whole place.

Don't you want it?
Ah, hell I'll get one soon enough. Besides, I want you to have it.
Ah, hell I'll get one soon enough. Besides, I want you to have it.
Well I don't know --

Thank you honey. are you sure you don't want it?
Absolutely positively.
You want to hear the good news first, or the bad news?
Give me the bad news.
Give me the bad news.
We retrieved a few things from the trunk, including a steamer trunk, or the remnants of a trunk, the brass clips and so forth.

But nowhere near three million dollars worth. I would say maybe twenty thousand.
There was more than that.
There was more than that.
Not in the trunk.
