Yes, O'Reilly?
How you, Radar?
You boys'll have to go to work early.
You fixing to add overtime to a twelve- hour day? The union ain't gonna like it.
What are you going to do with him?
Well... I was going to name you Chief Surgeon... To consult on both shifts, yours and Frank's.
Well... I was going to name you Chief Surgeon... To consult on both shifts, yours and Frank's.
Hey, that's great, Henry! Good thinking!
Stop him! Stop that man!
Sure, you just blindfold him first and tie him to a stake.
Now I got you for a witness, I'm going to try again. So far all I dragged out of him is he's from Bahston and he's only been in the Army two months. Where were you when they drafted you?
Home.
Home.
I mean, what were you doing? Were you a resident or on a staff someplace?
I mean, what were you doing? Were you a resident or on a staff someplace?
That's right.
That's right.
Where?

Hospital.

Which hospital?

Back home.

Is there any reason why we shouldn't know the name of it?
Is there any reason why we shouldn't know the name of it?
No. Or why you should.
Don't you use olives?
Where you think you are, boy? They probably never seen a olive in this country.
How you, Walt? We was just fixing to have a nightcap.
Pour one for Painless.
Miss you, Walt.
He said it for us all, Walt.
Pulse, slow, very little pressure.
Look at that right eye.

Epidural hematoma?
Epidural hematoma?
I don't know what else. You've been that route a little, haven't you?
I don't know what else. You've been that route a little, haven't you?
Not enough to be a pro.
She had this shiny black hair piled up on her head, but later on she let it hang loose and I'll be damned if it didn't come all the way down to her ass.
I've always had a hankering for blonde pussy myself. My wife's hair is a wonderful golden yellow, and this time of year it gets even lighter.
Okay, I'm a witness, but how do you prove who's right?
There's only one way.
It certainly isn't Henry's fault Hot Lips Houlihan doesn't like her name.
Or her figger.
Well, he's taken care of. Scratch one hot dog.
You really think we hurt him that bad?
You really think we hurt him that bad?
Hell, no, all you did was knock the wind out of him. But he won't be playing any more football today.
Y'all mind the store.
Four goddam months. And they don't even give you time off for good behavior.
Because is not democrash? All peoples created equal?
Hey, you been sneaking some reading outside the frigging Bible!

Good, because we got a fine old American custom we want to teach you. You know what these are?
I don't think I should have opened my big mouth. Sorry, Ho-Jon.
That's okay. Live a little, learn a little.
You  must  open  me  up  again?
No, Ho-Jon, we're not going to open you up.
Thou. For Thou art with me. Welcome, welcome, welcome!
What the hell's going on here?

Where's he gonna use that kind of talk? 'The valley of the shadow of death.' Wait a minute, Ho-Jon... I got something for you.
But first will you please kindly shut the goddam door?
I don't drink intoxicants.
I don't believe it's right for you to involve a boy who's not seventeen years old yet...
The door, Frank, the door! Where you from anyhow, Alaska?

Same general idea.
So long, Ho-Jon.
You make a mean martini, kid.
Us. Lead us not into...
...No cases over the age of temptation but deliver us eight. from evil. For Thine is the kingdom, the power and...
What?
When he sees a little running room, he likes to make a show... you know, stutter steps and cross-overs and all that jazz. Also he never learned to button up when he gets hit, so if you two can get a good shot at him once, you can hurt him.
We got to stop them right here.
And get ourselves another touchdown to win. I wish to hell we knew what they were plotting.
You mind if we get out of this guy's brain first?
What's there to do? You found the sliver.

You got directions?
Ayuh, only it's early, I need a drink to wake me up.
Ayuh, only it's early, I need a drink to wake me up.
I got some.
Make it yourself, or is it real?
Georgia, where I come from, it's real if you make it yourself. But I been buying from the Yankee Government since they put me in this soldier suit and give me a rate.

We got to head them off, right at the start. Push them around first.
What's the initials 'MP' stand for, Hawkeye?
Shore Patrol, Duke. Let's go!
Must be the Famous Curb Service Whore  House. You in the market Duke?
I done my shopping in Seoul last night.
Well, there it is. Jesus!
The spot we picked to spend the winter. Maybe we ought to look a little harder.
What do you think of that piece of scenery, Yankee boy?
Finest kind. We'll sit where we can get the best view.
Colonel Blake, have no fear. Hawkeye and Duke are here.
That's right, pal. You just sit up front and sign the mail, and leave the cutting to us.
Little light reading matter. Just right for his age.
Well, southern boy, I suppose you want the sack that's convenient to the door.
Well, southern boy, I suppose you want the sack that's convenient to the door.
And gets the wind every time it opens. No, thanks. I'll take that one.
This kid's ready but we won't know all the damage till we get in and see what's happened. What have you got?
Nothing can't wait. Shall we check it out with the Major?
Now that's what I call real pretty. We can close up here and go into his belly.
He can't take much more time on the table.
He can't take much more time on the table.
So we got to cut him fast. I figure from the X-ray it ain't just the spleen. We also got to snatch his right kidney.
Christ Almighty, I think he means it!
We been had.
We've stuck it out for a whole week now... Pretty girl.
We sure don't aim to cause any trouble... Yeah, she seems to grow on you.
No, Hawkeye just said it all.
Except we forgot one other small thing.

What's that?

Yeah, that's right. You better get us a chest-cutter before there's trouble.

Jesus to Jesus and eight hands around! Duke, did I ever tell you how I beat Dartmouth by intercepting a pass?
Sixteen times.
Sixteen times.
We didn't have a chance, little Androscoggin College against the Big Green, but there was this blizzard and we held then nothing nothing till the last twenty seconds. Then this great passer of theirs let one go, snow and all...

You met him. Walt Waldowski, the Dental Officer.

Nice guy, for an enamel surgeon.
Best equipped dentist in the whole goddam Army. Care to have a look, a man with your background?
Way we hear it, the Pride is supposed to have run up the highest lifetime batting average ever recorded in Wayne County.
This kid looks like a loser. Maybe we better get the bead-jiggler to put in a fix.
Call Dago Red.
And you've had a natural four times in a row in a crap game. Right? Does that mean...?
Not without lots of praying and kissing the dice. It's a different ritual but it works the same.
Not without lots of praying and kissing the dice. It's a different ritual but it works the same.
What do you think, Trapper?
Y'all just act natural.
Get out the scotch, Ho-Jon. Don't mention the sex thing unless he brings it up.
That there Frank Burns is a menace. Whenever a patient croaks on him it's either God's will or somebody else's fault.
This time he did it to a kid who's simple enough to believe him. Why don't you dump the mother, Henry? He creates more work than he gets done.
Hail to the chief! We-all got a responsibility, men. He's crowned like a king ought to be, but he can't just walk to the Mess Hall by himself. He has to be carried by native bearers.
Good thinking, Duke. How about it, Ho-Jon? Can you round up a few of the boys?
Never mind. Forget it.
A native is someone who is born in a particular place.
When will he be able to write?
What's he got to write, for God's sake?
What's he got to write, for God's sake?
An application to Androscoggin College.

You got yourself a bet, Georgia boy. You're a witness.
Where the hell we going to get us a football team?
All three of us played for our schools. And there are at least four other guys...
Never heard of him.
Sure you have, only as 'Spearchucker' Jones.
Sure you have, only as 'Spearchucker' Jones.
The nigra boy with the Philadelphia Eagles?
How come nobody knows about him? And you do?
I worked with Spearchucker my first month over here, at the 72nd Evac in Taegu. Most of the colored guys know who he is but they're not talking because he asked them not to.
Now wait a minute, Hawkeye. I come a long way, learning to put up with a couple of crazy Yankees, but...
Don't tell me about your problems, boy. Explain them to Ho-Jon.
Look at the size of those two beasts.
I don't think I could hurt one of them with a sledgehammer.
Don't try to get it far down. Kick it up high so we can get there and surround that son-ofa-bitch.
Yeah, if I can.
Me, too. Y'all just seen me play my last game.
Same here. You can retire my number.
Henry's got our orders! We're going home!
When?
When?
Any time. Whenever we want.
Any time. Whenever we want.
Be right with you.
There's no transportation anyway this time of night.
We could steal one of the choppers.

I looked. Suspicious bastards got them all locked up.

We got to start rehabilitating, Duke, if we want to be halfway human by the time we get back to our wives.

Screw it. We been earning our keep as respectable knife artists. Why should we do work any pill-rolling punk could handle?
Hell, man, that don't matter. We're loaded. We were big wheels in the black market in Seoul.
Plus running the opium concession for the whole Eighth Army.
Let's hear from you, you goddam Yankee. Be nice to see you some time.
Like the Spearchucker said, that's possible. Anyway, it's been an interesting association.
There's no point appealing to Colonel Blake. They've got him bewitched.
No. The only thing to do is write General Hammond. But it's hard to find a place around here for a private discussion.

And I'm grateful for you, Frank, especially with those boors around. We've grown very close in a short time.
Frank...
Don't stop now! Please...
Wait a second...
I can't... couldn't.
Is that liquor?
Finest kind. We're training Ho-Jon to be a bartender. Join us?
Give us this day our daily...
You ever caught this bread, and forgive our syndrome before, Duke?

I was just asking...
Shut up or I'll tear you apart.
If we had closer relations, there wouldn't be any misunderstandings. That's where a football game would help. Between your outfit and mine.
A football game?

Damn right. Three to one, as much as you want to put up.
Gimme three.
At ease. Captain Pierce, you have a seriously wounded patient for whom you are responsible. Yet I find you in a poker game.

You betcher ass, Dad.
You betcher ass, Dad.
What?
Pierce! That soldier requires immediate attention. I'm a surgeon and I know.
You betcher ass, General.
I'm going to play poker until three a.m. or until the patient is ready for surgery. However, if you'd like to operate on him yourself right now, be my guest. I get the same dough whether I work or not.
I want to talk to you, Pierce.
I want to talk to you, Pierce.
There's nothing to talk about, General. You take the case yourself or join me at three o'clock. Either way you're liable to learn something.
Now, General, I'm going to sandbag you. Do you think we're ready to get out of this belly?
Obviously you don't think so, and I don't know why.
Obviously you don't think so, and I don't know why.
Well, Dad, we haven't found any holes in the large bowel. They've all been in the small bowel, but the smell is different. I caught a whiff of large bowel, but it ain't staring us in the face, right?
Well, Dad, we haven't found any holes in the large bowel. They've all been in the small bowel, but the smell is different. I caught a whiff of large bowel, but it ain't staring us in the face, right?
Right.
Right.
So if it ain't staring us in the face, it's got to be retroperitoneal. And that, along with the look of the wounds, makes me figure he's got a hole in his sigmoid colon that we won't find unless we look for it.
And there it is.
I'm impressed, Pierce. Naturally, the kind of job I have, I don't get much chance to keep up with what goes on in the OR.

Neither does Henry Blake. But I'll tell you what makes him the best C.O. you've got in any of your hospitals. He leaves all the medical decisions to the men who do the day- to-day work and understand what meatball surgery is.
Well, it's still pretty much in the talk stage.
We had a team at the 325th Evac last fall. I coached the boys myself.

Must be fun. But the point we want to make about Henry...
I'm sure we could find a date for your team. Why don't I take it up with Henry? Thanks for the drink, boys.
I only wanted to know what she's like in the sack. Do those big boobs hold up or are they kind of droopy?
Hawkeye's asking the Major's opinion on a point of anatomy.

Also I'm curious whether she's a moaner or...

I though you said we didn't have a drop.

I found a doner.
Radar!
All you have to do is ask. The quarterback is saying they'll run the old Statue of Liberty. Their left end will come across and take the ball out of his hand and try to get around our left end.
What for?
We need medical officers for short- arm inspection starting the first afternoon out.

Oh, I'm not sailing with you. I work out of the hospital here.
I think I've seen this nut somewhere. Haven't I?
If you don't know what you've seen, why should I?
That's the front up the road a few miles. We have to get by without some of the comforts of home.
I like an olive.
Lucky you didn't have your mouth open or it would have gone down your throat.
He's Trapper John! Only man in history who ever found fulfillment in the ladies' can of a Boston and Maine Railroad car! When the Conductor caught him in there with his Winter Carnival date, she screamed: 'He trapped me!' What have you been doing since those days, Trapper?
What are they peeking at? Captain Waldowski in the shower?
Part of him. Painless is the owner and operator of the Pride of Hamtrack. That's where he comes from... Hamtrack, Michigan.
...But I turned in my knee pads.
Ho-Jon, give the Father some more martini.
Black capsule.
The black capsule. Finest kind. Thank you, Dr. McIntyre.
We're throwing him a Last Supper. We came to invite you.
The Painless Pole plans to cross the Great Divide tonight and we need your help to straighten him out.
Or you can let him knock himself out. You personally'd be sending him to his grave.
An eternal damnation.
We stand behind all our work.
You want it straight? Medical history records no instance of anyone taking this particular prescription and surviving.
It's a bedroom where a man is always at his peak and doesn't have to take any time outs.
And all the angels are built like Lieutenant Dish.
Very well, Your Majesty. Congratulations, Frank. He picked you.
No, no, that one.
No, no, that one.
Oh, you want to play it straight? I guess I owe you an apology.
I came within about ten yards of you. You know something, Trapper, the way we been going, if we ever got to see a real golf course again, I bet we could burn it up.
As far as the greens maybe. I don't know if my putting would come back or not, without some practice.
I'm not so sure the goddam thing's in his heart.
'Course it isn't, but how many chances do we get to go to Japan? With our golf clubs.
Let me translate. I've had some exposure to the language. The young man is from Brooklyn and he wants us to vacate this vehicle.
But weren't you supposed to meet the surgeons who are going to slice up the Congressman's son?
But besides the operation, we've got to get in at least eighteen holes of golf.
So let's haul ass, Sergeant.
Look.
Beautiful. What do you think? Should we stop and play nine holes now and operate on the kid later? If he's still alive.
Don't worry, son. That's Captain McIntyre, and he's the best chest surgeon in the Far East and maybe in the whole U.S. Army. He'll fix you up fine. Your daddy saw to that.
Just like we thought, it's a routine problem. Nurse, who's in charge of operating room preparations?
Did I ever tell you about Me Lay Marston?
Your high school friend who went around saying 'Me lay, you lay?' to all the young females in the community. As I remember, you said it was quite a successful approach.
Your high school friend who went around saying 'Me lay, you lay?' to all the young females in the community. As I remember, you said it was quite a successful approach.
Well, he wouldn't score more than once in seven or eight tries, but the important thing was he didn't waste time socializing. Anyway, Trapper John, this is Me Lay.
Please! Face it, Colonel, you don't have us, we have you. Your boys blew this case, we bailed you out. We figure we ought to hang around a day to check the Congressman's kid, and we also figure to play some golf. So if that's okay with you, we got a deal.
And if it isn't, why don't we call Washington on your telephone? You tell your story, we'll tell ours.
And if it isn't, why don't we call Washington on your telephone? You tell your story, we'll tell ours.
When you make up your mind, get in touch. The golf club is probably the best place to leave a message.
Come on, Trapper. We got to forget golf for today.
I don't know why. As long as it's light enough to see your caddie.
I don't know why. As long as it's light enough to see your caddie.
What's the age of consent in this country?
Is he out?
Like the Rock of Gibraltar.
Best thing you could do for all of us is grab some sack time.
Radar!
For you, Trapper.
Okay, but I'll need you to help. Duke, will you take that belly back there? The Australian?
It's in pretty deep.
Yeah, and he's lost a lot of blood. I'm afraid it's hit more that just the lung.
Christ, it's Ho-Jon!
Hiya, Ho-Jon. You got a piece of a shell in your chest, but we'll take it out as soon as you've had more blood. Hey, Radar!
If we squeeze him through, I'm going to get him into Androscoggin College.
How about squeezing him through into Dartmouth? If all he wants to do is catch lobsters, he can learn that here.
How about squeezing him through into Dartmouth? If all he wants to do is catch lobsters, he can learn that here.
Dartmouth's too big and too expensive. If he's as good as I think he is, he can move into the big league later. But Androscoggin first.

You aspirate the blood from the chest cavity. Damn, there's more of it than I thought.

If we don't get that pint, he's in trouble.
I don't feel anything.
Oh, Jesus.
I can't feel it now either. The mother must have gone in.
I don't get it.
I don't get it.
It was in the cava and the hole sealed itself off. I must have jiggled it just enough to turn it loose. I can't feel it in the heart or the right pulmonary artery. So it's in the left pulmonary artery.

What do we do?

We'll have to close this hole and make one on the other side.

Be kind of rough on him if there's no blood. Why don't we close up and sit on him a couple of days?
Be kind of rough on him if there's no blood. Why don't we close up and sit on him a couple of days?
Sure, that's the right way... at John Hopkins or someplace. But how do we know there won't be even more of a jam-up a few days from now? Maybe we won't be able to get to him when we want to. Maybe the goddam thing'll erode the artery when nobody's looking. Our best shot is now.
It's five minutes into nurses' shower hour. Where are they?
They're coming.
But he's got five times the man-power to draw on.
We can balance that by getting ourselves a ringer. Henry has to say he needs a neurosurgeon and put in a specific request for Dr. Oliver Harmon Jones.
He only lasted one season.
On account he got caught in the doctor draft. He was a surgical resident playing semi-pro ball weekends when the Eagles signed him.
So what makes you think he'll play for us?
We'll cut him in on the bets we make. And still have enough profit to send Ho-Jon to college.

Might make kind of a social issue, not having any other Negro officer.
Might make kind of a social issue, not having any other Negro officer.
He can move in here with us.
But we'd have to break his leg or something to keep him out of the game for good.
Not necessarily.
Captain Pierce, would I be imposing...?
Honey, nobody as pretty as you could ever impose... please sit down. Coffee?
Captain, I've been observing the nurses on your shift. But naturally your own opinion is more informed than mine.
I'm glad you feel that way, Major, because you see it's a team effort... doctors, nurses, enlisted men... and I feel responsible for my whole team, and I want you to know I'm satisfied with them.

On the contrary, I've observed he's not only a good technical surgeon, he's a good military surgeon. And that includes how a man dresses and how he bears himself and his sense of what it means to be an officer in the United States Army.

Okay, Major, honey. I'm going to have a couple shots scotch and go to bed. I'd normally ask you to join me but obviously you're a female version of the routine Regular Army clown. And that turns me off, so just leave my outfit alone and we'll get along fine. See you around the campus.

I wonder how a degenerated person like you could have reached a position of responsibility in the Army Medical Corps.

Sister, if I knew the answer to that I sure as hell wouldn't be here.
Hey, Knocko, I got those pictures you promised to look at of my kids. You too, Wilma. It won't take a minute. You can see them too, if you want.
No, thank you. I'm not the slightest bit interested.
Listen, we look pretty lousy out there, right?
Well, for college players that have been out of training seven or eight years...

I'm thinking about how we can make more money. Suppose we bet only part of our dough and keep this big animal out of the game the whole first half and let them roll up some points. Then you could bet the rest of our bundle between the halves and get the General and his friends to give us some real odds.
The bastards outconned us.
I think we could still have a chance.

If you start the game instead of waiting, you mean?

No, let's stick to that strategy till we see whether you boys can do two things. The first is get that halfback out of the game. He had one year with the Rams before the Army got him, but he didn't play too often because he's one of those hot dogs.
What's the matter?
We may be in trouble, I can't catch my breath. I've got the occupational disease of oversized ex-athletes.
See you.

Hang in there.
Isn't this ridiculous, Doctor? Six months I've been here and there are still times when I can't stand it. I just go to pieces.
There's nothing ridiculous about it. A kid like you...
Thank you, Captain Pierce. It's been so long.
No trouble at all. Hawkeye.

Yes, I know. Hi, Ho-Jon. How did it go?

The real Trapper John? The one who threw you the famous pass and went to greater glory on the Boston and Maine Railroad?
The one and only.
The one and only.
Proud to know you, Trapper. Like to shake your hand if you'll hurry up and get that chest closed. You still working the trains?
You don't go after the local scrunch?
I'm too busy, actually. Not for the Army, of course, but where I live. Dr. Yamachi's New Era Pediatric Hospital and Whorehouse. I'm serious. The guy has this crude hospital for kids and a whorehouse on the side to finance it, all in the same building.
What do you do in the joint besides pimp?
That's about the only thing I don't do  that I'm built for. I inspect the girls and take care of some of the kids in the hospital. Sometimes I tend bar and act as bouncer.
Why can't you look at him?
I have but well, you know, I've been mainly an anesthetist a long time now and... well, I'd like you guys to take a look at him.

Every time we feed him, it either comes right back up or he coughs and turns blue and has a hell of a time.
He's coming to.
Let's get his clothes off quick.
Glad to know you. Drop in at my clinic anytime you feel like playing a little poker, or even if a tooth is bothering you.
Poker sounds great. When do you play?
If a man isn't a man anymore, what's he got left to live for?

What did you have to test, for God's sake... the dental Don Juan of Detroit?
What did you have to test, for God's sake... the dental Don Juan of Detroit?
Don Juanism is just a cover... I've been reading up on it. I'm a fake, I'm a fraud, I've been living a lie!
Painless, you mustn't talk that way. It's a lot of crap. Cover for what?
Homosexuality.
Now I know that's been my problem since I was a kid. But it only caught up to me last night.
You've been drawn to other males? Since you were a kid?

No, one thing I finally know for sure, I'll never function with a woman again.
That's really what I came here for. See what you guys recommend.
Well, I'm sure my colleagues will agree there are a number of dependable measures for extinguishing the vital forces.
In the direction you want to go.
You guys got any black capsules?
How much time do I have?
Just about enough to say goodbye to everybody. Line up over here, men, if you want to pay your last respects. Keep moving and file on out when you're through.

Big day. Two jaws to rebuild.
Good morning, Captain Pierce and Captain Forrest.
You can cut the bow.

I have not understood what you means.

That. It's out of the act.
Officer all sleep now, yes? And I go wash clothes.
Right, Ho-Jon. See you later.
Hi, Ho-Jon. How they goin'?
Finest kind. Captain Forrests say you better haul ass home quick. We got new chest-cutter in our tent.
There ought to be a law against dentists reading. Matter of fact, I thought there was. Anyway, this is an obsession. He can't be persuaded out of it.
He's comin' this-a-way! The jaw- breaker!
And if I go to New York, the natives there will carry me? I don't think so.
I don't think so either.
Pain bad, Ho-Jon?
I  wouldn't  wish  it  on  a  maneating  shark.
I'm Colonel Blake. You fellows just passing through?
Nope, we're assigned heah.

But we strongly suspect something will happen to screw up this splendid organization of yours if you don't get that sky pilot out of our tent.
But we strongly suspect something will happen to screw up this splendid organization of yours if you don't get that sky pilot out of our tent.
Your tent?
We'll find out what they are when you throw us out.
That's all the commitment you're offering me? Or do you have some more extravagant gesture of cooperation?
You work those kind of hours, you got to have rest. Which you can't get with somebody jabbering away on a direct line to heaven.
Major Burns will be out of your tent in twenty-four hours. Tell them Captain Pierce and Captain Forrest are on their way.
About that chest-cutter...
I'll try, d-d-dammit! You can't ask any more than that!
I'll try, d-d-dammit! You can't ask any more than that!
We don't want any more than that. Right now.
Stop acting like a colonel, Henry. You know Trapper wouldn't sock him without a good reason.
There's no reason good enough for one medical officer to strike another.
I should fire him because he got in the way of Trapper's fist? No. I've put up with a lot from you guys, but now I finally have to take disciplinary action.
Christ. All of a sudden it's West Point.
First decent idea you've had in a month.
Now I'll have to wait at least a week. If I announced it tomorrow, after what our new Chief Nurse saw this afternoon, they'd hear her yelling from Seoul to Washington.
Fifteenth straight day there've been six o'clock choppers. How long can a battle go on?
You got to relax, Henry. Since the deluge started, you been working in the OR and running the outfit, too.
It's a nice idea. I mean it has style.
It's the only way we can make enough to put Ho-Jon through Androscoggin.
What's going on? Who started this?
You mean who hit who?
You mean who hit who?
Yes, that's what I mean.
Yes, that's what I mean.
I did. First and only blow. So far.
If you say so, Henry. But remember my claustrophobia.
I deeply regret this unfortunate incident. We try to remember we're a military organization.
What's wrong with you?
I don't know. I must have lost my punch. I didn't think the son-of-a- bitch would get up.
We got it, men... Ho-Jon's keep as Androscoggin... if there is such a place. And the big news is, the General wants a rematch.
I'll tell you my news. I'm retiring from football.
O'Reilly!
Yes, sir?

We've got too many wounded for us to handle now! Get on the phone right away and...
We've got too many wounded for us to handle now! Get on the phone right away and...

Don't do that, Radar! You make me nervous.

Don't come so quickly when I call. I want you to take these officers...

Good morning, Colonel.
Morning, Radar. How were things?

Splendid, sir. No problems.

Can you make out what they're talking about?
I can try, sir.
Chopper coming in, Colonel. Two of them, I'm afraid.
Damn.
Damn.
And another one, but it's from the south. There.
If I can make a suggestion, Coach.

In that case, here are ten basic plays. I think that's about all this bunch can handle.
Thank you, Spearchucker. I'll certainly take a look at these. Where the hell did you ever get that name?
I used to throw the javelin.
Those two big guys were tackles on the Cleveland Browns, and the redhead played halfback with the Rams.
They can't do that to me!
Well, there's one big satisfaction.
What's that, Henry?
What's that, Henry?
I out-coached that General Hammond.
Morning, girls. Good morning Major.
Good morning.
This one goes right to the OR. Tell Duke to do him ahead of the busted spleen. And this kid can't wait. I'll take him myself, before I get to that ruptured diaphragm.
Captain... 'This kid' is a prisoner of war.
Captain... 'This kid' is a prisoner of war.
Yeah?
Yeah?
It's an American boy's rupture you're supposed to close.
It's an American boy's rupture you're supposed to close.
Listen, we get a deluge like this, just deciding priorities on a medical basis is hard enough. So never mind the side issues.
Okay, I'm closing up. Everybody relax.
May I have the surgeon's name, please?
Planes mostly. May take a crack at rickshaws. How does the direct approach work over here?
I been out of action since I got over here five months ago.
What's the bastard really like?
Colonel Merrill is a veteran of twenty- five years in the Regular Army, a soldier first and a doctor second. A member of several patriotic organizations, he believes it's America's God-given mission to maintain a foothold for freedom on the Asian mainland.

Never mind.

Mine's already been struck, and it doesn't have to be very fancy.
Soup? Rice? What are we doing, beginning all over again?
No, we had a clear soup to start. This is a thick one and you ought to taste it. There's nothing like it back home.
No, we had a clear soup to start. This is a thick one and you ought to taste it. There's nothing like it back home.
How can I taste it now? We've already had like twelve courses.
Can you guys take one minute to look at a kid for me?
Now?
We don't have to see him. Call that halfassed Army hospital and tell them to be ready to put some lipiodol in this kid's esophagus and take X- rays.
But it's ten-thirty at night. We can't get military personnel out for a civilian. A foreign civilian.
How is he?
Nice.
Nice.
Arterial silk.
Ease off on those tapes, and let's see how much it bleeds. How is he?
Nice.
Nice.
Boys, we're home free.
As long as there's a pile-up, we can do our bit to encourage his permanent withdrawal from the contest.
It's a technique Ugly John and I worked out in case something like this came up.

Oh, that's 'cause we both play doohickies. I met him in a box car a couple o' years ago. I was foolin' around with my harmonica and he comes over and joins in. I haven't been able to shake him since.
Action?
Um-hum.

Can't. I'm feeling too good.

Hello, John.

Look, John. Something terribly important's happened. They're forming John Doe Clubs. We know of eight already and they say that there's going
John Doe Clubs? What for?

Uh-huh. To carry out the principles you talked about in your radio speech.

Well, you got your circulation. Now, why don't you let me alone?
Well, you got your circulation. Now, why don't you let me alone?
Oh, it started as a circulation stunt, but it isn't any more. Mr. Norton wants to get back of it and sponsor John Doe Clubs all over the country. He wants to send you on a lecture tour.

Me?
Me?
Uh-huh.
Can I help you pack?
No, thank you.
Do you care if I sit down out here?
No.
You know, I had a crazy dream last night. It was about you.
About me?
About me?
Sure was crazy. I dreamt I was your father.
Well, would you like to know who it was you were marrying?
Well, a tall handsome Ubangi, I suppose.
Well, a tall handsome Ubangi, I suppose.
No, not that bad. It was a fella that sends you flowers every day. Er, what's his name? Mr. Norton's nephew.
Ted Sheldon.
Yeah, that's the one.
But here's the funniest part of it all. I was the fella up there doing the marrying. You know, the Justice of the Peace or something . . .
You were? I thought you were chasing me?
You were? I thought you were chasing me?
Well, yes, I was. But I was your father then, see? But the real me, John Doe, er, that is, Long John Willoughby, I was the fellow up there with the book. You know what I mean?
Well, yes, I was. But I was your father then, see? But the real me, John Doe, er, that is, Long John Willoughby, I was the fellow up there with the book. You know what I mean?
I guess so. Then what happened?
I guess so. Then what happened?
Well, I took you across my knee and I started spanking you.
How many people do you think we've talked to already, outside the radio, I mean?
I don't know. About three hundred thousand.
I don't know. About three hundred thousand.
Three hundred thousand? What makes them do it, Ann? What makes them come and listen and, and get up their John Doe Clubs the way they do? I've been trying to figure it out.

Look, Johnwhat we're handing them are platitudes. Things they've heard a million times: "Love thy neighbor," "Clouds have silver linings," "Turn the other cheek." It's just a
Look, Johnwhat we're handing them are platitudes. Things they've heard a million times: "Love thy neighbor," "Clouds have silver linings," "Turn the other cheek." It's just a
Yeah, I've heard them a million times, too, butthere you are. Maybe they're like me. Just beginning to get an idea what those things mean.
Did you write this?
Yes, I did, John. But II had no idea what was going on.
Yes, I did, John. But II had no idea what was going on.
You didn't?
Go ahead, driver! Ball park!
John, please let me go with you! Please, John!
. . . Er, this John Doe idea is yours, huh?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
How much money do you get?
How much money do you get?
Thirty dollars.
Thirty dollars.
Thirty dollars? Well, er, what are you after? I mean, what do you want? A journalistic career?
Thirty dollars? Well, er, what are you after? I mean, what do you want? A journalistic career?
Money.
Money.
Money? Well, I'm glad to hear somebody admit it. Do you suppose you could write a radio speech that would put that fellow over?
Money? Well, I'm glad to hear somebody admit it. Do you suppose you could write a radio speech that would put that fellow over?
Oh, I'm sure I can.
Oh, I'm sure I can.
Do it, and I'll give you a hundred dollars a week.
Do it, and I'll give you a hundred dollars a week.
A hundred dollars!
A hundred dollars!
That's only the beginning. You play your cards right and you'll never have to worry about money again. Oh, I knew it.
Hello. Whenever there's a pretty woman around, er This is my nephew, Ted Sheldon, Miss Mitchell.
How do you do.
Thank you very much for everything.
And, Miss MitchellI think from now on you'd better work directly with me.
And, Miss MitchellI think from now on you'd better work directly with me.
Yes, sir.
Better let me talk to him.
All right, but present it to him as a great cause for the common man.
Oh, somebody else sitting there?
No, no, nothat's your seat.
Oh! Oh, it's beautiful, D. B. WellI don't quite know what to say . . .
Well, don't say anything at all. Just sit down.
Oh!
Go ahead, open it, open it.
Tomorrow night, before a crowd of fifteen thousand people, and talking over a nation-wide radio hook-up, John Doe will announce the formation of a third party.
A third party?
A third party?
Yes. The John Doe Party.
Devoted entirely to the interests of all the John Does all over the country. Which practically means, ninety per cent of the voters. He will also announce the third party's candidate for the presidency. A man whom he, personally, recommends. A great humanitarian; the best friend the John Does have.
Mr. D. B. Norton!
Hello?
John! I'm so glad to see you. II was terribly worried.
Hello there. Well, well! If it isn't the man about town!
All set, Ann?
All set, Ann?
Huh? Oh, yes. Let's go. Now, let's see. We want some action in these pictures.
That's good.
No, no, no. This man's going to jump off a roof.
No, no, no. This man's going to jump off a roof.
Oh.
Oh.
Here. Wait a minute. Let me comb your hair. Sit down. There. That's better.
Stick a fork through me! I'm done. I'll never get this speech right.
Oh, yes you will, Ann dear . . . you're very clever.
Oh, yes you will, Ann dear . . . you're very clever.
Yeah, I know. What are you looking for?
Yeah, I know. What are you looking for?
Your purse. I need ten dollars.
Your purse. I need ten dollars.
What for? I gave you fifty just the other day.
What for? I gave you fifty just the other day.
Yes, I know, dear, but Mrs. Burke had her baby yesterday. Nine pounds! And there wasn't a thing in the houseand then this morning the Community Chest lady came around and

And the fifty's all gone, huh? Who's the ten for?
And the fifty's all gone, huh? Who's the ten for?
The Websters.

You remember those lovely people your father used to take care of? I thought I'd buy them some groceries. Oh, Ann, dear, it's a shame, those poor
You remember those lovely people your father used to take care of? I thought I'd buy them some groceries. Oh, Ann, dear, it's a shame, those poor
You're marvelous, Ma. You're just like Father used to be. Do you realize a couple of weeks ago we didn't have enough to eat ourselves?
You're marvelous, Ma. You're just like Father used to be. Do you realize a couple of weeks ago we didn't have enough to eat ourselves?
Well, yes, I know, dear, but these people are in such need and we have plenty now.
Well, yes, I know, dear, but these people are in such need and we have plenty now.
If you're thinking of that thousand dollars, forget it. It's practically gone. We owed everybody in town. Now, you've just gotta stop giving all your money away.
Oh, I'm sorry, Ma. Oh, don't pay any attention to me. I guess I'm just upset about all this. Gee whiz, here I am with a great opportunity to get somewhere, to give us security for once in our lives, and I'm stuck. If I could put this over, your Mrs. Burke can have six babies!
Do you mean the speech you're writing?
Do you mean the speech you're writing?
Yeah, I don't know. I simply can't get it to jell! I created somebody who's gonna give up his life for a principle, hundreds of thousands of people are gonna listen to him over the radio and, unless he says something that's, well, that's sensational, it's just no good!

Well, honey, of course I don't know what kind of a speech you're trying to write, but judging from the samples I've read, I don't think anybody'll listen.
Well, honey, of course I don't know what kind of a speech you're trying to write, but judging from the samples I've read, I don't think anybody'll listen.
What?
What?
Darling, there are so many complaining political speeches. People are tired of hearing nothing but doom and despair on the radio. If you're going to have him say anything, why don't you let him say something simple and real, something with hope in it? If your father were alive, he'd know what to say.

Wait a minute . . .
Wait a minute . . .
Huh?
That's your father's diary, Ann.
Father's . . . I never knew he had a diary.
Father's . . . I never knew he had a diary.
There's enough in it for a hundred speeches, things people ought to hear nowadays. You be careful of it, won't you dear? It's always helped keep your father alive for me.

You bet I will, Ma.
Yeh, D. B. Oh, just cleaning out the dead-wood. Okay.
Look, Mr. Connell . . . I just can't afford to be without work right now, not even for a day. I've got a mother and two kid sisters to . . .
I'll tell you what I'll do. I get thirty dollars a week. I'll take twenty-five, twenty if necessary. I'll do anything you say.
It isn't the money. We're after circulation. What we need is fireworks. People who can hit with sledge hammersstart arguments.
It isn't the money. We're after circulation. What we need is fireworks. People who can hit with sledge hammersstart arguments.
Oh, I can do that. I know this town inside out. Oh, give me a chance, please.
No. I've had the whole army and navy searching for you because that's a game we play here every day.
I remember, distinctly, being fired.
I remember, distinctly, being fired.
That's right. But you have a piece of property that still belongs to this newspaper. And I'd like to have it!
That's right. But you have a piece of property that still belongs to this newspaper. And I'd like to have it!
What's that?
What's that?
The letter.

The letter from John Doe.

Oh!
Oh!
The whole town's in an uproar. We've got to find him. The letter's our only clue.

There is no letter.

We'll get a handwriting expert to What!
We'll get a handwriting expert to What!
There is no letter.
Say that again.
There is no letter. I made it up.
You made it up.
Uh-huh. You said you wanted fireworks.
Well, the whole town's curious about John Doe and, boom, just like that you're going to bury him. There's enough circulation in that man to start a shortage in the ink market!
In what man!
In what man!
John Doe.
John Doe.
What John Doe?
What John Doe?
Our John Doe! The one I made up! Look, genius Now, look. Suppose there was a John Doeand he walked into this office. What would you do? Find him a job and forget about the whole business, I suppose! Not me! I'd have made a deal with him!

A deal?
A deal?
Sure! When you get hold of a stunt that sells papers you don't drop it like a hot potato. Why, this is good for at least a couple of months. You know what I'd do? Between now and let's say, Christmas, when he's gonna jump, I'd run a daily yarn starting with his boyhood, his schooling, his first job! A wide-eyed youngster facing a
Now, then comes the drama. He meets discouragement. He finds the world has feet of clay. His ideals crumble. So what does he do? He decides to commit suicide in protest against the state of civilization. He thinks of the river! But no, no, he has a better idea. The City Hall. Why? Because he wants to attract attention. He wants to get a
So?
Very pretty. Very pretty, indeed, Miss Mitchell. But would you mind telling me who goes on Christmas Eve?
John Doe.
John Doe.
What John Doe?
What John Doe?
The one we hire for the job, you lunkhead!
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Lemme get this through this lame brain of mine. Are you suggesting we go out and hire someone to say he's gonna commit suicide on Christmas Eve? Is that it?
Well, you're catching on.
Well, you're catching on.
Who, for instance?
Who, for instance?
Anybody! Er, erBeany'll do!
You're supposed to be a smart guy! If it was raining hundred dollar bills, you'd be out looking for a dime you lost some place.
Holy smokes! Wasting my time listening to this mad woman.
That's fine! That's fine! Now fall right into their laps. Go ahead. Say John Doe walked in and called the whole thing off. You know what that's going to sound like on top of this!
That's all, Ned. Thank you.
Okay, sister, you get your job back.
Plus a bonus.
Plus a bonus.
What bonus?
I can read. I can read!
Sorry.
So you think this is worth a thousand dollars, do you?
Oh, the Chronicle would consider it dirt cheap.
Oh, the Chronicle would consider it dirt cheap.
Packs everything, including a gun. Okay, sister, you've got yourself a deal. Now let's take a look at the candidates. The one we pick has gotta be the typical average man. Typical American that can keep his mouth shut.
Looks all right
He's perfect! A baseball player. What could be more American!
He's perfect! A baseball player. What could be more American!
I wish he had a family, though.
That's our man. He's made to order.
I don't know. He don't seem like a guy that'd fall into line.
I don't know. He don't seem like a guy that'd fall into line.
When you're desperate for money, you do a lot of things, Mr. Connell. He's our man, I tell you.
Hurry up, Pop.
Oh.
Oh.
Right here. Sit down.
All right, boys, here he is.
No, no, no! You can't take pictures of him like thateating a sandwichand with a beard!
But, he's gonna jump off a building!
Yes, but not because he's out of a job. That's not news! This man's going to jump as a matter of principle.
Yes, but not because he's out of a job. That's not news! This man's going to jump as a matter of principle.
Well, maybe you're right.
Well, maybe you're right.
We'll clean him up and put him in a hotel roomunder bodyguards. We'll make a mystery out of him. Did you speak to Mr. Norton?

Oh, swell! Is that the contract?

Yes. What's he doing here?
Yes. What's he doing here?
Friend of his. They play duets together.
Friend of his. They play duets together.
Duets? But can we trust him?
Duets? But can we trust him?
Oh!
Well, okay. But we don't want more than a couple o' hundred people in on this thing. Now the first thing I want is an exact copy of the John Doe letter in your own handwriting.
I got it all ready. Here.
I got it all ready. Here.
Well, that's fine. Now I want you to sign this agreement. It gives us an exclusive story under your name day by day from now until Christmas. On December twenty-sixth, you get one railroad ticket out of town, and the Bulletin agrees to pay to have your arm fixed. That's what you want, isn't it?
Okay, fellows.
Take it easy, John Doe.
And you! Start pounding that typewriter. Oh, boy! This is terrific! No responsibilities on our part. Just statements from John Doe and we can blast our heads off.
Before you pop too many buttons, don't forget to make out that check for a thousand.
Before you pop too many buttons, don't forget to make out that check for a thousand.
Awwwww!
Yeah, but it's got everybody sore. Ads are being pulledthe Governor's starting a libel suitwhat's more, they all know John Doe's a phoneyand they insist on seeing him.
Well, what about it? Let them see him! We'll go them one better. They can also hear him. You own a radio station, Mr. Norton. Why not put him on the air?
Look. We can't let 'em get to this bush-league pitcher and start pumping him. Good night! No telling what that screwball might do. I walked in yesterdayhere he is, standing on a table with a fishing pole flycasting. Take my advice and get him out of town before this thing explodes in our faces!
If you do, Mr. Norton, you're just as much of a dumb cluck as he is! Excuse me.
If you do, Mr. Norton, you're just as much of a dumb cluck as he is! Excuse me.
No, you've got yourself a meal ticket and you hate to let go.
No, you've got yourself a meal ticket and you hate to let go.
Sure, it's a meal ticket for me. I admit it, but it's also a windfall for somebody like Mr. Norton who's trying to crash national politics. That's what you bought the newspaper for, isn't it? You wanta reach a lotta people, don't you? Well, put John Doe on the air and you can reach a hundred and fifty million of 'em. He can say
What's the idea?
No, no, no. Now that's too much!
Listen. If that guy lays an egg. I want to get something out of it. I'm getting a Jane Doe ready!
That's fine, honey. Now, get out!
Now listen, Annhe can't possibly get in without our seeing him. I'm watching the side door and the Colonel's out front, so stop worrying.
Thank you.
How many is that, six? Pretty hungry, weren't you?
Say, all this John Doe business is batty, if yuh ask me.
Say, all this John Doe business is batty, if yuh ask me.
Well, nobody asked yuh.
Well, nobody asked yuh.
Trying to improve the world by jumping off buildings. You couldn't improve the world if the building jumped on you!
Oh, stop worrying. He's all right.
That's
Colonel!
You shouldn't have gotten out of bed, Miss.
You shouldn't have gotten out of bed, Miss.
Has he been here?

Oh. Gee, you're swell! Oh.
No sense in going up there! I been here for hours. He ain't here!
Oh, let me go, will you!
Oh, let me go, will you!
Now, that's crazy. It's fourteen floors!
Had any schooling?
Yeah, a little.
Yeah, a little.
What do you do when you work?

Where'd you play?
Where'd you play?
Bush leagues mostly.[5] Med. shot: To include the rest of them. They have their eyes glued on his face. ANN is very much interested.
I went up to Miss Mitchell's house, boss. Boy, she's in a bad way.
Where is she?
Where is she?
Hey, do you know something? She supports a mother and two kids. What do you know about that?
Hey, do you know something? She supports a mother and two kids. What do you know about that?
Did you find her?

No. Her mother's awful worried about her. When she left the house she said she was going on a roaring drunk. Er, the girl, I mean!
No. Her mother's awful worried about her. When she left the house she said she was going on a roaring drunk. Er, the girl, I mean!
Go out and find her!
Go out and find her!
Sure. Hey, but the biggest thing I didn't tell you . . .
Hello! . . . Yeh?
Her old man was Doc Mitchell. You know, the doc that saved my mother's life and wouldn't take any money for it? You remember that? Okay, boss, I'll go and look for her.
just called the morgue, boss. They say there's a girl there
Shut up!
Ann! Say, why didn't yuh
Beany!
Hey, boss. Get a load of this.
What?
What?
Look!
What do they want?
They all say they wrote the John Doe letter.
Yeah, Boss?
Take charge of him. Get him a suite at the Imperial and hire some bodyguards.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Both of 'em?
Both of 'em?
Yes, both of 'em! But don't let him out of your sight.
Hey, Boss.
Oh, quiet, quiet, quiet. Say, tell me something did you read that speech you're gonna make tonight?
Gee whiz, Boss, you know Mr. Norton told me not to leave him, not even for a minute.
Go on, go on, go on. And we'll be at Jim's Bar up the street.
Hey, wait a minute, Mr. Doe!
. . . Tubby?
Help yourself.
Naw.
I've seen guys like you go under before. Guys that never had a worry. Then they got ahold of some dough and went goofy. The first thing that happens to a guy
Hey, did yuh get a load of the bedroom?
Hey, whatsa matter with a bank account, anyway?
And let me tell you, Long John. When you become a guy with a bank account, they got you. Yes sir, they got you!
And let me tell you, Long John. When you become a guy with a bank account, they got you. Yes sir, they got you!
Who's got him?
Who's got him?
The heelots!
The heelots!
Who?
And when they get you, you got no more chance than a road-rabbit.
Hey. Who'd you say was gonna get him?
Hey, Doc, look. Look, Doc. Gimme that again, will yuh? Who's gonna get him?
The heelots!
The heelots!
Who are they?
Listen, sucker, yuh ever been broke?
Sure. Mostly often.
Sure. Mostly often.
All right. You're walking alongnot a nickel in your jeansfree as the windnobody bothers youhundreds of people pass yuh by in every line of businessshoes, hats, automobiles, radio, furniture, everything. They're all nice, lovable people, and they let you alone. Is that right?
Ba-ll!
I don't know how you're gonna stand it around here till after Christmas.
St-rike!
I know why you're hangin' aroundyou're stuck on a girlthat's all a guy needs is to get hooked up with a woman.
Holy smoke! A half a heelot!
There you are, Boss, just like you ordered. Symbols of the little people.
Well, I'll be doggoned if over forty people don't show up. 'Course none of us knew what to do, but we sure got a kick out of seeing how glad everybody was just to say hello to one another.
Tell him about making Sourpuss chairman, honey.
Tell him about making Sourpuss chairman, honey.
Oh, yeah. We made Sourpuss chairman and decided to call ourselves The John Doe Club. And, say, incidentally, this is my wife. Come here, honey.
Grubbel's here. See?
Yeah. That'sthat's him. Of course, you don't know Grubbel, but he's the man that everybody figured was the worst no-account in the neighborhood because he was living like a hermit and nobody'd have anything to do with him. Er, that is until Murphy, the postman told us the truth. "Why, Grubbel," he says, "he lives out of garbage cans because he won't take charity.

Just like you said on the radio, Mr. Doe.
You don't have toWhy, we're with you, Mr. Doe. We just lost our heads and acted like a mob. Why, we . . .
What Bert's trying to say iswellwe need you, Mr. Doe. There were a lot of us didn't believe what that man said.
This is Sourpuss. Er, excuse me. Er, Mr. Smithers, Mr. Doe.
Ththat's all right. If you didn't call me Sourpuss, it wouldn't feel natural. There are snickers from the background.
Ththat's all right. If you didn't call me Sourpuss, it wouldn't feel natural. There are snickers from the background.
Well, anyway, II guess nearly everybody in the neighborhood came, except the DeLaneys. The Delaneys live in a big house with an iron fence around it and they always keep their blinds drawn, and we always figured that he was just an old miser that sat back counting his money, so why bother about inviting him? Until Grimes, the milkman spoke up and he

Old man Delaney has been bringing his furniture over to my place at night, one piece at a time, and selling it.
And then we started to find out about a lot of other people.
Yeah, sure. Er, you know Grubbel, for instance.
Well, sir, about a dozen families got together and gave Grubbel a job watering their lawns. Isn't that wonderful? And then we found jobs for six other people and they've all gone off relief!
Yeh. Er, and my boss, Mr. Schwabacker made a job in his warehouse for old man Delaney
No!
Well, thank you for listening. Goodbye, Mr. Doe. You're a wonderful man and it strikes me you can be mighty useful walking around for a while.
How could he be a fake?
It must be some kind of a gag.
It must be some kind of a gag.
A what?
A what?
A gag. A gag!
It makes no difference, Bertthe ideas's still good. We don't have to give up our club.
Yeah? Well, you can have it!
That man is gonna be on that roof. Don't ask me how I know. I just know. And you know it as well as I do.
Sure, sure. I'd like to believe in fairy tales, but a guy that's fake isn't gonna jump off any roof.
Hey, pretty nifty, huh?
You ain't gonna get me to stay here.
You ain't gonna get me to stay here.
Sure, you are.
Sure, you are.
No, sir. That spot under the bridge where we slept last night's good enough for me.
Gimme mine. I ain't staying! You know we were headed for the Columbia River country before all this John Doe business came up. You remember that, don't yuh?
Sure. I remember . . . Say, did your ears pop coming up in the elevator? Mine did.
Sure. I remember . . . Say, did your ears pop coming up in the elevator? Mine did.
Aw, Long John . . . I tell youit's no good. You're gonna get used to a lotta stuff that's gonna wreck you. Why, that fifty bucks in your pocket's beginning to show up on you already. And don't pull that on me neither!
Aw, Long John . . . I tell youit's no good. You're gonna get used to a lotta stuff that's gonna wreck you. Why, that fifty bucks in your pocket's beginning to show up on you already. And don't pull that on me neither!
Stop worrying, Colonel. I'm gonna get my arm fixed out of this.
Hey, stop worrying, Colonel. Fifty bucks ain't going to ruin me.
I seen plenty of fellers start out with fifty bucks and wind up with a bank account!
You win, Colonel. Here's the fifty. Go on out and get rid of it.
You bet I will! As fast as I can! Gonna get some canned goodsa fishing rod, and the rest I'm gonna give away.
I gotta figure some way out of this thing!
The elevators are still runnin'.
Yeah, she's a heelot just like the rest of them. It's lucky you got away from her.
What was I doin' up there makin' a speech, anyway? Me? Huh? Gee, the more I think about it the more I could . . .

Join the John Doe Club.
John Doe Club?
I trust him.
Oh, you trust him, eh? Well, that's fine. I suppose he trusts you, too?
Yeah, but it's got to be by Bone- Setter Brown.
Okay, Bone-Setter Brown goes. Here, sign it. Meanwhile, here's fifty dollars for spending money. That's fine. Beany!
Hello, Mr. Connell.
Hiyah, John. John, I want to have a little talk with you. What's the matterare you falling? Come here.
No, I never read the speeches before I make them. I get more of a kick out of it that way.
Uh-huh. That's exactly what I thought. Beany, go on down to the office, tell Pop to give you the speech. There's a copy on my desk.
Now, that's all right, isn't it?
You betcha.
I get mad for a lot of other guys besides myselfI get mad for a guy named Washington! And a guy named Jeffersonand Lincoln. Lighthouses, John! Lighthouses in a foggy world! You know what I mean?
Yeah, you bet!
Listen, palthis fifth column stuff's pretty rotten, isn't it?[11]
Yeah. It certainly is.
Yeah. It certainly is.
And you'd feel like an awful sucker if you found yourself marching right in the middle of it, wouldn't you?
You must be wrong, Mr. Connell, 'cause he's been marvelous about the John Doe Clubs.
Yeah? Say, you're sold on the John Doe idea, aren't you?
Yeah? Say, you're sold on the John Doe idea, aren't you?
Sure.
Sure.
Sure. I don't blame you. So am I.
All right! Now, supposing a certain unmentionable worm, whose initials are D. B., was trying to use that to shove his way into the White House. So he could put the screws on, so he could turn out the lights in those lighthouses. What would you say about that? Huh?
Nobody's gonna do that, Mr. Connell. They can't use the John Doe Clubs for politics. That's the main idea.
Nobody's gonna do that, Mr. Connell. They can't use the John Doe Clubs for politics. That's the main idea.
Is that so? Then what's a big political boss like Hammett doing in town? And a labor leader like Bennett? And a lot of other big shots who are up at D. B.'s house right now? Wolves, John, wolves waiting to cut up the John Does! Wait till you get a gander at that speech you're gonna make tonight!

You're all wet. Miss Mitchell writes those speeches and nobody can make her write that kind of stuff.
You're all wet. Miss Mitchell writes those speeches and nobody can make her write that kind of stuff.
They can't, huh? Who do you think writes 'em? My Aunt Emma? I know she writes them.
Don't write 'em? Why, that gold- grabbin' dame would double-cross her own mother for a handful of Chinese yen!
Shut up! If you weren't drunk I'd
Go down to the office and arrange for some radio time.
Why, D. B., you're not going to fall for
Why, D. B., you're not going to fall for
I want it as soon as possible.
I want it as soon as possible.
Okay. I just came in to get warm, myself. Come on, let's go.
Well, I don't get it.
Huh? Get what?
Huh? Get what?
Look, D. B. I'm supposed to know my way around. This John Doe movement costs you a fortune. This convention's gonna cost plenty.
Look, D. B. I'm supposed to know my way around. This John Doe movement costs you a fortune. This convention's gonna cost plenty.
Well?
Well?
Well, I'm stuck with two and twobut I'm a sucker if I can make four out of it. Where do you come in?
Well, I'm stuck with two and twobut I'm a sucker if I can make four out of it. Where do you come in?
Whyuh
I see. I'd better stick to running the paper, huh?
I think maybe you'd better. And ConnellI'd like to have the John Doe contract, all the receipts for the money we have advanced him and the letter Miss Mitchell wrote, for which I gave her a thousand dollars.
I think maybe you'd better. And ConnellI'd like to have the John Doe contract, all the receipts for the money we have advanced him and the letter Miss Mitchell wrote, for which I gave her a thousand dollars.
Yes. Sure.
Only one thing to do, Hank. Drop the whole business quickly.
How?
How?
Run a story. Say John Doe was in here, and is sorry he wrote the letter and
Run a story. Say John Doe was in here, and is sorry he wrote the letter and
That's right. You got it! Sure! He came in here and I made him change his mind. "Bulletin editor saves John Doe's life." Why, it's perfect. I'll have Ned write it up. Oh, Ned!
Miss Mitchell, do me a favor, will you? Go on out and get married and have a lot o' babiesbut stay out o' newspaper business!
Better get that story in, Hank, it's getting late.
If you ask me, Hank, you're playing around with dynamite.
No, no, no, the gal's right. We can't let the Chronicle get the laugh on us! We've got to produce a John Doe now. Amateur journalism, huh! I'll show those guys.
Show me an American who can keep his mouth shut andI'll eat him.
Okay, Beany, bring 'em in one at a time. Wipe to: Montage: Half a dozen different types of hoboes appearand in each instance ANN shakes her head, negatively.
Did you write that letter to Miss Mitchell?
No, I didn't.
What are you doing up here then?
Well, the paper said there were some jobs around loose. Thought there might be one left over.
How about family? Got any family?
No.
No.
Oh, just traveling through, huh?
Oh, just traveling through, huh?
Yeah. Me and a friend of mine. He's outside.
What's your name?
Willoughby. John Willoughby, Long John Willoughby they called me in baseball.
Look, Mr. Norton, I think you've got a lot of nerve having those people hold us here.
There's nobody holding you here, Mr. Doe. It's only natural that people
There's nobody holding you here, Mr. Doe. It's only natural that people
Well, if there's nobody holding us here, let's get going. Incidentally, my name isn't Doe. It's Willoughby.
Why, certainly. With your ability to influence people, it might grow into a glorious movement.
Say, let's get something straight here. I don't want any part of this thing. If you've got an idea I'm going around lecturing to people, why you're crazy! Baseball's my racket, and I'm sticking to it. Come on, Colonel, let's get out of here.
Is there anything wrong?
Oh, no. Nothing's wrong. Everything's fine! So there's gonna be a new order of things, huh? Everybody's gonna cut himself a nice, fat slice of the John Does, eh? You forgot one detail, Mr. Big Shotyou forgot me, the prize stooge of the world. Why, if you or anybody else thinks he's gonna use the John Doe clubs for his own rotten purpose, he's

Now, hold on a minute, young man! Hold on! That's rather big talk! I started the John Doe clubs with my money and I'll decide whether or not they're being properly used!

There! You see? He admits it! You're a fake, John Doe! And for what you've done to all these good peoplethey ought to run you out of the countryand I hope they do it!
It's good to see you. Sit down.
Thanks.
It's for Ann . . .
Oh, how nice! Thank you very much.

I'm terribly sorry she isn't here.

Yeah. I, uh, well . . . No. It'll wait. Say, he's a nice man, isn't he? Mr. Norton, I mean. He's, er, he's done an awful lot for the
Well, I guess I'll see her at the convention later.
Yes, of course. I'll see that she gets the flowers.
Thanks. Good night, Mrs. Mitchell.
Good night, John.
Oh, yeah. That's what I mean. See? It was easy as all that, huh?
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, yeah, but look, Mrs. Mitchell, you know I love Ann and it's gonna be awfully hard for me to say it because, well, you know, she's so wonderful, and, well, the best I ever was was a bush-league pitcher.
I bet you he'd know how to say it all right. And me, I get up to it and around it and in back of it, but, but I never get right to it. Do you know what I mean? So the only chance I've got is, well, if somebody could kinda give her a warning sort of, sorta prepare her for the shock!
You mean you'd like me to do it, huh?
You mean you'd like me to do it, huh?
Well, I was thinking thatYeah, you know, sort of break the ice.
Pretty good? Say, I was just about ready for the major leagues when I chipped a bone in my elbow. I got it pitchin' a nineteen-inning game!
Nineteen!
Nineteen!
Yep. There was a major league scout there watching me, too. And he came down after the game with a contract. Do you know what? I couldn't life my arm to sign it. But I'll be okay again as soon as I get it fixed up.

Y-yeah. Gee, doggone it, I never thought about that. Gosh!
And another thing, what about all the kids in the country, the kids that idolize ball players? What are they gonna think about you? Close shot: Of the COLONEL. He has dropped his gloveflopped into a chairand has taken out his ocarina.
I know one way you can do it.
How?
How?
Well, when you get up on the radio, all you have to do is say the whole thing's a frame-up. Make you a hero sure as you're born!
Yeah, but how am I gonna get my arm fixed?
Well, that's a cinch. I know somebody that'll give you five thousand dollars just to get up on the radio and tell the truth.
Say, who's putting up this dough?
Feller runs the Chronicle . Here's the speech you makeand it's all written out for you.
Have you got the speech I gave you?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Now, look. I'll give this money to the Colonel just as soon as you get started. We'll have a car waiting at the side entrance for you.

They're not usually graduate students.
SWAT wants to go in.

What's the rush? They haven't killed anybody yet this week?
No -- you can't do that.
You got 7 hostages in there, 1 of them's wounded -- We don't know how bad it is -- The guy ripped the phone out -- SWAT said he's got a gun to the head of a female hostage. If SWAT makes entry now, you're gonna lose 1 hostage, maybe 2. I gotta go in. Maybe I can see what's going on in there.

Mind if we make a stop on the way? We busted Frank Antonucci on possession. He gave us a lead on that Polk Street jewelry heist.
"Phoney Frank"? Don't waste your time. He'd tell you his granny was in on the Kennedy assassination if he could dodge a collar.

This SWAT guy might be a good idea. He may be able to take a little pressure off you. I worry about you.
You worried about me, too? The chief's worried about me. Solis is worried about me. Maybe you guys should start some kind of organization.

May I come in? I would just like to ask you a couple of questions.
Duke Ellington. "Things Ain't What They Used To Be", recorded July 30, 1945.

I've got to stop in there... Mr. Korda, do you know Frank Antonucci?
You mean Frank who owns the bakery down the street?
Could I please have a little water?
Of course.
Perhaps for his own reasons he entangled me in this... situation.
This cousin of yours... What's his name?
This cousin of yours... What's his name?
Clarence Teal.
You told Antonucci that shit came from me.
So that we could get the best price. He's got respect for you. He's gonna try to lowball me, Mike.
You fucking idiot! Why do you think I use you?... To be a walking advertisement.
I'm sorry, Mike. I never heard of LaMarra flipping on anyone before. He said he had the cops paid off. Antonucci never flipped on anyone before. He had the cops paid off.

Leave town? They're going to know me in fucking Des Moines now!... They got over ten million in jewels in that place. That's freedom, man. I could go anywhere I want.
You gotta do this for me. I'm in here because of you.
Man, what's this about? Ya know, you were robbing a store. It wasn't personal. It was his job.
Man, what's this about? Ya know, you were robbing a store. It wasn't personal. It was his job.
Fuck you! You know what he did to me?!...

You can't help me, man.
Who's controlling your mind?
Whoa!... The government. They control everybody's mind. You're too fucking stupid to know that?
This has nothing to do with Walter.
They want Walter dead!
Tell me what's wrong.
Particles, man. I feel them all the time. I feel them in my arms and legs man, that's how they punish me.

It's not just the particles man, it's the whole fucking machine, this is how they get assassins to operate. It's been this way since the cuban missile crisis.
They have less power over you if you look into my eyes.
Huh?
Tell my dad.
Tell him what, what do you want me to tell him?

Tell my dad I'm sorry about the watch.

Is that where you're family lives?
Where's the car?
I need to get something straight first.
It's my job to see that no one gets killed, Earl... Including you.
Then where's my FUCKING car!

Hi, Roper.
Hi, Kimura. Where's the command post?
The suspect came in shortly after the bank opened. Botched robbery. A teller hit the silent alarm. He took seven hostages. Shot one -- the guard. He's still alive. So far he's asked for...

Earl.
We got a guy who's probably on drugs. He's got a record of 459's and he was busted on possession. But he's never been busted on a major felony. What's his demeanor?
Well he's a little fucking agitated -- he ripped the phone out.
Well he's a little fucking agitated -- he ripped the phone out.
I have to go face to face.
Anything on Korda so far?
Solis said to keep you clear of this.
What do you got on Korda?
We ran a search on relatives. He has a cousin in town -- Clarence Teal. Smalltime thief. Last known address was on Pine Street. He moved out a month ago. We've got a couple leads on him to check out.

Roper, we're into it...
You don't have to come here.
Yes, I do. That way there's no misunderstandings. I need to make sure no one's hurt, then we can take care of business.
Alright, Roper. You want to come... come.
Good. I won't be armed. We gotta operate on trust here. We're going to wrap this up and have you guys out of here as soon as possible.
Are you in charge, Roper?
Yep.
Yep.
I want a car. Like a four wheel drive. I want it in perfect condition. I want a uniformed cop to drive it up right here. I want him to leave the engine running and walk to the end of the street. Then we'll come out. I don't want any remote control devices in it. I know all the tricks. If it's not in
I want a plane waiting at the airport. I'll tell them where I want to go when I get there.
Is that all?
Is that all?
For now that's all.
For now that's all.
You'll get it. But, Joe, I want you to do something for me. Let me take a look around inside. Make sure everybody's okay.
You'll get it. But, Joe, I want you to do something for me. Let me take a look around inside. Make sure everybody's okay.
No. You just do shit for me right now.
Joe, I'm doing a lot for you. I think you could give me something to cement the deal... One hostage.
I'll give you something.
You can't kill me like this.
What if you and me got into a struggle... and my gun went off?
Open your shirt.
I'm not wearing a wire. This is just between you and me.
I'm not wearing a wire. This is just between you and me.
Shut the fuck up and do what I say!
Satisfied?
Open the bag, dump everything on the table.
It's all there.
Spread it out.
I'm impressed. I didn't think you could do it. What did you have to do, steal them?
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's not going to look too good on your service record.
That's not going to look too good on your service record.
I'll worry about that. Let's get on with it.
Same here. I've watched you in action. Very impressive.
You've got a lot of hard work ahead of you if you want to be a negotiator.
You've got a lot of hard work ahead of you if you want to be a negotiator.
I'm ready to do it. And I'm going to be here more than two weeks.
Don't go reading my lips, man. That's an intrusion. Save that shit for the sniper school. Comprende?
Sorry... Habit.
We're already past it, aren't we, Kevin?
If you say so.
You ever been in a hostage situation?
Only at the very end.
Only at the very end.
How do you feel after a shooting.

I know.

Try to remember that.
What's the point of this?
A little exercise in lateral thinking. The obvious solution isn't always the only solution... See you tomorrow.
I'm sorry about your friend. I had a friend in SWAT killed. I know how it can be.
I appreciate your concern. Let's leave it at that.
So, McCall, how come you ended up in San Francisco?
They recruited me. Promised me fast advancement.

Is there something wrong with that?
Is there something wrong with that?
I'm not sure.
How are we gonna get him out of there?
We could fill it with water.
Eighty-five percent of domestic disturbances of this nature end in murder/suicide.
Not the ones I'm at.
Come on. Let's go for a drink.
I don't really like to drink.
I don't really like to drink.
You have to. It's a tradition.

Well, if I have to, I have to.

Every couple of months, huh?
That's a lot of commitment. I admire that.
Do you really?

No. Actually I think it's fucking crazy, I don't know if I could do it.

Thanks for clearing that up. I hear your former girlfriend is going out with Greg Barnett.
Thanks for clearing that up. I hear your former girlfriend is going out with Greg Barnett.
Where did you hear that?
Where did you hear that?
Around. Barnett's tough competition.
Around. Barnett's tough competition.
Yeah, well that's a sore subject, and therefore out of bounds to a young sprout of a hostage negotiator under my tutelage.
Lesson two, "Dead Eye"... should have been lesson one. Never exchange yourself for a hostage.
I think I can handle that one.
I think I can handle that one.
Yeah, you think so, but it comes up.
You think you can learn, McCall?
I think so.
First things is, don't say, "What's going on?" Everybody knows what's going on. I come into this situation, I say, "I'm glad to see nobody's hurt. That's good. I'm here to help you." Second: You hesitated. Don't hesitate. If you're thinking, talk while you're thinking, or else he's going to think you're plotting. Which you are. If he thinks you're plotting, you're going to
No.
No.
It'll come. Try again.
Tell me what you need.
I need you to bring me the scumbag who ran off with my wife so I can cut off his nuts.
I can't do that.
Then get out of my face you worthless piece of frogshit.
Nah, I just throw that in because I enjoy it.
So what do I say to this guy?
So what do I say to this guy?
You could say something like, "Tell me what the scumbag's name is. Maybe we can work something out."
You could say something like, "Tell me what the scumbag's name is. Maybe we can work something out."
What? Bring somebody in so he can cut his nuts off?
If you want to be a successful negotiator, you've got to learn to lie.
I'm not good at lying.
I'm not good at lying.
Get good at it.
Get good at it.
It's against my nature.
You know the ten commandments?
Yes.
Yes.
What's the first commandment?
What's the first commandment?
Thou shall have no other God before me.
You tell me.
Thou shall not kill... You've killed, right?
Thou shall not kill... You've killed, right?
Yes.
Yes.
Why?
Why?
To save lives.
To save lives.
So why would you hesitate to lie to save lives?
My name's McCall. I'm unarmed.
Okay, stop.
What did you see?
A dirtbag behind the counter holding a sawed-off. A Berretta nine millimeter in his belt. A female hostage, red dress, on the floor in front of the cereal display. Male hostage, jeans and blue checked shirt, three feet to her right. Another male hostage, white pants, green shirt, Nikes, laying in front of the magazine rack. A female dirtbag with a gun under her
Why did he do it?
Because he knew the little girl had zero chance of survival and his chances would be a little better... We had a plan, but SWAT opened up too early. He got caught in the crossfire. Let's move on... Notice this. Always use the eyes to keep the connection. It almost like hypnosis. That's the most important thing. Create a connection. You're always on their
You know why I like the track?
You're a compulsive gambler?
See the favorite? Tail up. Washy. He doesn't want to run today. Cross him off... Now the Six looks good. On his toes. Coat shiny. This trainer/jockey combo does well. We can't leave him out. What do you think?
I have two words for you... Seek help.
I have two words for you... Seek help.
I have three words for you... Ex-ac- ta.
I bought you a four-six exacta box. You owe me twenty bucks.
I do.
We need the 4 and 6 to finish to first and second.
Fine.
Ronnie... Yeah, so.
Now she's going out with Greg Barnett?
Now she's going out with Greg Barnett?
So what do you want?... An autograph.
So what do you want?... An autograph.
I don't know why she'd pick him over you.
I'm just practicing my lying.
Still needs work.
Still needs work.
You're right. I'll never be as good a liar as you.
The 6 horse is last.
That's okay. That's his style.
That's okay. That's his style.
To run last?

To run late!
The 6 horse is still last.
He'll be running at the quarter pole.
They need to run first and second?
Yeah, first and second.
COME ON RUSSELL!... Who the fuck's Russell?!
The jockey!

You want to bet on whether you won your bet? This is getting sick.
How long you been coming here?
About six years. My partner took me.
About six years. My partner took me.
Is it always like this?
Is it always like this?
Occasionally you lose.
See this. Solis has me driving the shit-mobile, and he picked this up straight out of impound for fourteen grand. Probably worth thirty.
Police corruption. It's everywhere.
There's your answer. He's smart.
He's cutting down the visibility.
He's cutting down the visibility.
And doing a very good job of it.
He's got the girl.
Damnit!
What the fuck is going on.
I don't know, but I've got to get on there.
I don't know, but I've got to get on there.
You're crazy.
You're crazy.
Pull up alongside.
It might have happened no matter who was up there.
Bullshit! Would it have happened to you?
Bullshit! Would it have happened to you?
Maybe... There's one thing you have to remember... You don't create the situations. You can only try to save people from them.
Maybe... There's one thing you have to remember... You don't create the situations. You can only try to save people from them.
I thought I could do it. I was so damn sure of myself. But I didn't know what to say. The words wouldn't come. My mouth turned to mush. You make it look so easy, Roper. But it is not. It's not easy. It's a different job than looking through the rifle scope.

That it is.
How many have you lost?
I look at it as how many I've saved. That's the way you've got to look at it.

You've got to decide that for yourself.
He's gonna kill her no matter what. If I take him these jewels he's gonna kill me and her.
So what do you want to do?
So what do you want to do?
That's a chance I gotta take.
That's a chance I gotta take.
Then we better get moving... But there's no way we can get the jewels out of evidence.
Mare Island is an abandoned shipyard, cranes, high buildings... he'll be in place where he can see everything. How are we going to get me in there?
Good question.
McCall, you all right?
I'm okay. Korda... went down the side of the building...
I'm okay. Korda... went down the side of the building...
Stay put.
Roper. Metro Division. Hostage Negotiator. Give me the short version.
Husband came home. Found that guy and his wife "in flagrante". Now he's holding her at knife point.
Husband came home. Found that guy and his wife "in flagrante". Now he's holding her at knife point.
Which apartment?
Have you evacuated anyone?
Only that floor.

Is the hostage injured?

Don't know. She keeps screaming to stay out. He keeps screaming to stay out. We decided to stay out.
Don't know. She keeps screaming to stay out. He keeps screaming to stay out. We decided to stay out.
Well, there's a good amount of agreement on that.
I know how you feel, Ray.
You don't know shit, and I suggest you leave.
I can't leave, Ray. It's part of my negotiator's oath. Once I'm in the room with the hostage, I have to stay.
You don't want to see what I'm going to do to her.
You don't want to see what I'm going to do to her.
Let me show you something, Ray.
Same thing happened to me, man. She cheated on me, but I forgave her. You know why?
I ain't interested in your life story.
I ain't interested in your life story.
Because I was partially to blame. I wasn't around as much as I should have been. I forgot how to love her.
Because I was partially to blame. I wasn't around as much as I should have been. I forgot how to love her.
She's the one to blame. Not me.
Ray, think about how she looked when you married her. Think about how happy you were. Don't lose that, man. Don't give up everything.
What am I giving up? I'm laid off last year. I'm down to my last unemployment check. I'm out on the streets looking for work and this bitch is banging some asshole in my bed.
Ray, if you walk out of here with me, I'll get you a job.
Doing what? Cleaning toilets?
Doing what? Cleaning toilets?
I can't guarantee you what it will be. But I swear on my life, I'll find you work.
I can't guarantee you what it will be. But I swear on my life, I'll find you work.
And why the fuck would you do that for me?
And why the fuck would you do that for me?
Not for you, Ray. For me. A close friend of mine was killed this week. The way I figure it, I stop you from doin' what you said, I'm one up on body count.

About 4 months old. I'm working in a new style.

What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?
Something I guess I can't have anymore.
Something I guess I can't have anymore.
Don't try to make me feel guilty. The whole time we were together, you went out of your way to prove you didn't need me. Now, suddenly, for one night, you need me again. I can't do it. I can't be more than your friend. Because I know what will happen. In a few weeks you'll be back on top, and you'll shut me

Scottie...
Scottie, remember the day you lost that hostage in union square. You came over that night and we made mad, crazy love. But I didn't even know what happened... 'til I heard it on the news the next morning.
It's because I wanted to keep you away from that world.

Veronica, it's not easy for me... I don't know if I can change overnight. But what I'm telling you is that I want to share everything with you, because I don't ever want to be without you again.
What about Greg? What are you gonna tell him?
It's okay. We broke up.
It's okay. We broke up.
When?

Just now.
How's Paco doing?
He was going nuts at the park. He met this very attractive poodle. They made plans to meet again next weekend.
You like this place?
It's very nice.
It's very nice.
I guess you realize that there's something special that I want to talk to you about.
There is?
For the last week things have been going pretty well between us. I think we've been doing a good job getting intimate and all that stuff...
Yeah?
...Let me just show you.
How come in those foreign movies the young girl is always with some fat, old guy.
In Europe women find older men very sexy.
Korda escaped.
And you think he'll...
I don't think you're old and fat enough for me.
Use your imagination.
Why don't you come back up with me, Ronnie.
I think I'll stand out here in the sun.
Scottie, Scottie...
It's all over, babe, it's all over.
Stay here, don't move.
Scottie...
Scottie...
Do it!
I've never seen sea so blue. Tahiti is magnificent, Scottie.
Yeah, I could get used to this Paradise shit.
Scottie?
Hmm?

Hmm?
Things have been going pretty well between us, haven't they?
Things have been going pretty well between us, haven't they?
Yeah.
Yeah.
You've changed you know. I don't think there's anything you can't do once you put your mind to it.
I was just thinking... There's something special I want to talk to you about. I think it's time we went to a whole other phase in our relationship. A deeper level.
A deeper level?
A deeper level?
That's right. We've got to bare it all. Here and now. 'Cause I think I'm finally ready to go for it...
That's right. We've got to bare it all. Here and now. 'Cause I think I'm finally ready to go for it...
Whoa! Wait a minute, Ronnie. Hold on. I know it's beautiful here. The sun, the sand, the sea and all that nature shit can really get to you. But we've got to keep our perspective here. This place isn't real. This isn't reality.

We've only seen and talked to one suspect. He calls himself "Joe". There's two jewelers, two salespeople, the manager, a security guard, and an elderly woman. This particular store is where they do a lot of jewelry making and repair. They have anywhere from 8 to 10 million in raw stones on any given day, so they sure as shit didn't just wander in.

Halden, how nice to hear your voice.
Halden, how nice to hear your voice.
What do you want?
What do you want?
I have found in life that what one wants isn't nearly as important as what one needs.
I have found in life that what one wants isn't nearly as important as what one needs.
What do you need?
What do you need?
I need to take back what's mine.
There are two million people in there with you.
Yes.
Yes.
They have nothing to do with this --
They have nothing to do with this --
-- Two million people lost in the digital night. What do they seek?
God-Damn you!
Yes, I believe he has --
Yes, I believe he has --
-- You've made your point! You've got control of the system.
System's running on auxiliary. Only seven hours before it crashes.
True.
True.
You're in there. Everybody dies, you go with them --
You're in there. Everybody dies, you go with them --
-- But don't you remember? I'm already dead.
It's okay.
Okay...
Okay...
It's all been transferred.
Why?
To live forever.
She said I have a son...
No, she said she had a son. In a dream she once called life.
How come I can't remember?
Because I took it out of your memory.
Because I took it out of your memory.
Why --
Why --
-- Because there'll be no remorse. Not in my world.
As long as it's not 'what's your sign?'
If you could meet God, what would you say to him?
That's a strange question. You a strange man?
There you are, sitting next to the creator, what do you say?
There you are, sitting next to the creator, what do you say?
This is how you pick up women --
This is how you pick up women --
-- No.
Your life that bad?
No, not me, I've been lucky. But I've seen what happens to other people --
No, not me, I've been lucky. But I've seen what happens to other people --
-- If your life's so good up there Gena, what are you doing down here?
Do you believe in miracles?
I'm serious, how did you know my name?
You were right.
About what?
Who are you?!
Someone who believes in miracles.
You don't have much sex up there in the real world, do you?
No...
It's all here...
Yes.
The guests are here.
Guests?
Guests?
Just like you always wanted.
But this is impossible.
That's the grace of this world. Nothing's impossible.
What's happening?
Nothing, go back to sleep.
It's time to wake up.
Wake up?!
Wake up?!
From the dream.
The patterns were moved around, but they weren't changed.
True. But why?
Halden sent men to kill me in my sleep, but simple illusions won out. So he now sends the legend to finish the deed.
No.
No.
Then what?
But what would happen to me? I have no body to return to.
Not my problem.
Not my problem.
So wrong --
Divinity?
Yes.
Yes.
You are not a God.
You are not a God.
In here I am.
God creates man, man creates technology, technology creates God. End into beginning.
In a computer program.
In a computer program.
The new world.
The new world.
It's not real.
It's not real.
Not real?
You were the one who was dying.
Yes...
You sealed off the system. When it crashes, everyone dies with you.
Yes, but only in the dream they call life.
Yes, but only in the dream they call life.
Dream?!
Dream?!
And all dreams, no matter how appealing, must eventually end.
Unlimited energy out there. Enough to run this world for all eternity --
-- But you'll never be able to get it through the maze.
-- But you'll never be able to get it through the maze.
Me? Of course not. That's why you're here.
With the energy from the net, we can program this world anyway we want. Redwood forests. Oceans. Mountains --
-- Two million people plugged-in here.
-- Two million people plugged-in here.
Yes.
Until you're on the net where the corporation can't touch you, you can't open the system. They'll eject it if you do.
One would assume so.
But once the system touches the net, all links are severed. Everybody dies.
Only up there in the dream they called life.
Only up there in the dream they called life.
And down here --
Remember, I'm not the one who chose this.
Yes, so which one of us does that make the coward?
Where the hell are you going?
Unfinished business.
Unfinished business.
And what about the reconfiguration?
And what about the reconfiguration?
Perfect opportunity for you to demonstrate your continued worth.
You sure he's going to come?
It's his nature.
It's his nature.
But what if he doesn't --
But what if he doesn't --
-- He will.
How long 'till we can eject?
We're going to have to reconfigure.
We're going to have to reconfigure.
How long?
How long?
At least a day.
Have communications contact all interface centers. Tell them due to high demand, we're at full capacity and so temporarily there's no room for anyone else on the system.
What about the customers with reservations?
What about the customers with reservations?
Have the staff apologize profusely and issue credit vouchers. But remember, it's a capacity problem. That's all.
The maze has been changed --
-- He says the maze has been changed. I need to know for sure.
Where you plugged-in from?
New York.
New York.
I'm South Dakota.
What?
The weather.
What's her name?
Who?
Who?
The woman you're stuck on.
The woman you're stuck on.
There is no --
Take care.
Take care? Where the hell are you going --
He had keys.
Of course the legend would like to think that. But no one has keys. Your maze was run.
Get some internal police there. Tell them to run a perimeter.
But have them wait for me 'till they move in on him.
Doesn't make sense. How the hell does some fucking teenager get to the keys?
Sorry, I just design the maze. Keeping the keys secure is your job.
Two maze runners.
Someone sends the kid a copy of the access program, then runs the maze at the same time the kid does, using the same codes.
Won't be time if he gets access --
-- He won't.
He had access to the keys --
-- Yes.
We can be there in fifteen minutes and rip him off the system.
Go!
You're jumping to conclusions.
He's not plugged-into the system. He's in the fucking system!
Try harder.
Christoph had spinal cancer. His body kept rejecting gene therapy. He was desperate. It was him, it wasn't us --
Christoph had spinal cancer. His body kept rejecting gene therapy. He was desperate. It was him, it wasn't us --
-- I saw the program.
Corporate fingerprints all over it.
Of course they are. Christoph was stealing every piece of code he could get his hands on.
Of course they are. Christoph was stealing every piece of code he could get his hands on.
And you weren't involved.
Because why the hell would you be interested in a program that allows people to live inside your machines? I mean how much profit could there possibly be from owning the universe and selling space in it to people who are dying, or people who are just God-Damned sick of this world --
-- Come on, you know F.C.O. regs. Anyone caught with their R and D hand in the bio-digitization cookie jar spends the rest of their life in federal penitentiary. It's not worth it.
The only way to eject it is from the inside.
You've got the keys, send someone in --
You've got the keys, send someone in --
-- Christoph changed the maze.
One condition.
What?
What?
The truth.
What is it?
The Terrace. First building Christoph ever programmed for us.
The Terrace. First building Christoph ever programmed for us.
A hotel?
A hotel?
It's not used for anything.
Christoph was a brilliant programmer, but very eccentric. He insisted it be kept vacant.
Why?
Why?
He wouldn't say.
Christoph was in charge of designing building modules.
That's right.
That's right.
Then what's with all the staffing programs in his account?
Then what's with all the staffing programs in his account?
Good question.
Be a hell of a lot easier to digitize a real person, then strip them down to a module you can use to make as many employee programs as you need.
Yes, in theory, I suppose that would work.
Who did he digitize?
Listen to yourself. Digitization. You know that officially that's a pure fantasy --
Listen to yourself. Digitization. You know that officially that's a pure fantasy --
-- Who did he digitize?!
What did he tell you?
The truth.
The truth.
Not his style.
Not his style.
Katie was digitized.
Then you had her killed.
Why would I do that?
Why would I do that?
To hide the evidence.
We drugged her. So she wouldn't remember.
Try harder.
Try harder.
There was no need to kill her.
There was no need to kill her.
Then where is she?
Then where is she?
Come on Tanner, think this through.
An interface attendant.
Where?
Where?
Times Square.
Need the disk back!
Insurance.
Insurance.
Insurance?
Insurance?
If she's alive, you get it back.
What brings you inside?
Cleaning up a mess.
Cleaning up a mess.
Some things never change, do they?
I've got to get back.
Tanner.
Someone you have to get back to?
No.
I'm sorry sir, we need your debit card before we can issue a credit --
-- Katie.
You went to my high-school?
No.
No.
Then how do you know about --
Then how do you know about --
-- You told me.
-- You told me.
What are you talking about?
Most nights you wake up crying. Never knowing why.
Who are you?!
We worked together on the inside. You were on my programming team --
-- The inside?
-- The inside?
Night City.
Identical. One's you. One's digital.
That's not possible. No one can do that.
That's not possible. No one can do that.
Corporation can.
That's why they told you you can't go inside. They can't have you running into her.
Her?
You said we were on the same programming team.
Yes.
Yes.
But I don't know anything about programming.
But I don't know anything about programming.
Once they digitized you, they added it.
Why?
It was a test.
It was a test.
For what?
To see how long it would take for me to realize.
Realize?
Realize?
You weren't real.
And it meant something.
Yes.
What?
Way you kiss me.
I wasn't with you.
I know.
I know.
But you were with me.
But you were with me.
Not you. A copy.
Not you. A copy.
What's the difference?
I'm sorry.
Sorry?!
Sorry?!
There was no other choice.
Care to tell us how you came into possession of an illegal access program?
Look, I'm doing mute 'till I have a mouthpiece here who's on my side.
Look, I'm doing mute 'till I have a mouthpiece here who's on my side.
You don't need a lawyer. We found the program on your laptop.
Don't know what you're talking about.
Of course you do. And the only shot you've got of keeping your ass from sinking in a sea of shit is to tell me where you got this program.
What's so funny?
This. No point to it.
This. No point to it.
Why not?
Why not?
Because you'll never believe me.
Because you'll never believe me.
Try me.
It was just there.
There?
There?
My uni-net account. I log on. The program's there.

He's on us!!
Wait a second... What time is it?
It's passing over earth as we speak! Trajectory coordinates are 009843.
Billy, that's BRILLIANT!
Billy, that's BRILLIANT!
We get Ivan into the Comets PATH--
WE CAN'T BREAK FREE!
IMPACT IN EIGHT SECONDS!
Alpha. Is there any way we can defeat this monster? Any way at all?
... Perhaps there is a way... I have heard tales of another power.
It's far too dangerous. Zordon would never allow it.
If we don't try, Zordon won't survive!
Ay, yi, yi, yi. The legend speaks of a Master Warrior who lives on the planet Phaedos... This is the only person who knows the secrets of the power.
How can we reach Phaedos?
Rangers... I'm afraid you're too late.
What?!
What?!
Zordon... he's gone.
Is this... food!
They're called squirbs.
So how can we get to it?
The only way to obtain the power is to achieve the highest state of being...
He wants to know if you'd like a cube of sugar in your tea.
Ah... sure.
In the language of the Nathadians, "Nin" stands for "man", "jetti" stands for "animal". Ninjetti - man and animal, together as one. Now, put your hands inside the flame.
Yeah, right.
Yeah, right.
It will not harm you.
Wow. Sand.
Now tell me... what do you see?
Aisha, you are the Bear, stalwart and bold.
Stylin'!
I heard that!
I'll be at the Observatory Sunday.
... What's happening to him?'
Outside of his time warp he's aging at a vastly acellerated rate!
I can hardly walk...
I've never been this sore in my life.
We've come all this way for a rock wall?!
There should be a way to open it.
Release the power with the power.
I've got it! We use the mirrors to reflect the light back into itself!!
SYSTEM MALFUNCTION!
OUR SEMI-CONDUCTORS ARE DOWN!
Anybody see anything?
... Let's take a look over there.
SABER TOOTH TIGER!
WHITE TIGER!
Let's teach these vermin a few manners.
Activating Power Beam!
That's pretty bad.
Thank you, Dulcea. For everything.
Release the power WITH the power.
What does that mean?!
1600 m.p.h. and increasing!
Everybody hold on tight. We're gonna send this sucker into OBLIVION!
In a place that came to be known as Angel Grove.
The chamber has been accidently UNCOVERED! You must return it to the depths. or anyone should open it and Ivan is released!

To assist you I have retro-fitted your helmets with new Opti-Scan devices.
Use extreme caution, Rangers. You are dealing with an evil here that is beyond ALL comprehension.
Alpha, my sensors tell me the Rangers were too late! Ivan is on his way here!
Hey, NOBODY enters the Command Center without a power coin!
... Alpha, I am deeply concerned about the Rangers...
I told them it was too dangerous, but they wouldn't listen.
I told them it was too dangerous, but they wouldn't listen.
... We must try to communicate with them.
By bouncing ultra-high frequencies off one of the network satellites, I can send a long-range pulsar signal to within TWO FEET of the Rangers coordinates.
... I just pray we're not too late.
Ay, yi, yi! The Rangers are going to be CRUSHED!
Don't lose hope yet, Alpha!
It is said that to those who possess the Power... all things are possible.
Where did it originate?
Where did it originate?
In another time, another dimension. It was brought here long ago by the "Nathadians", a people who are now all but extinct. They built an impenetrable stone Monolith to store the power and keep it from their enemies. For thousands of years, beings from all over the Universe have tried to obtain it... ALL have perished.
I see... a fox
Close. Billy, you are the Wolf, cunning and swift.
It is said that once you've reached the power... you have only ten triacs to release it.
What's a Triac?
What's a Triac?
About twenty seconds in your time.
PTERODACTYL!
TRICERATOPS!
You okay?
I think so.
I am the wolf, cunning and swift!
I am the crane, agile and sublime!
Of course! The power is of another world. Another dimension.
WE'VE GOT TEN TRIACS BEFORE WE'RE TOAST!!
NINJA CRANE ZORD!
NINJA WOLF ZORD!
All systems go!
This guy is messing with the wrong teenagers!
That's the only way to the Monolith...
We can take these guys!
... Nothing.
Release the power with the power.

... Not bad.
Listen, we appreciate your hospitality, but we really don't have much time.
Let's go after him!!
Ultra Ninja Megazord complete!
I'm in!
LET'S FLY!
IMPACT IN FIFTEEN SECONDS!
WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE!!
FOUR SECONDS TO IMPACT!
WE'RE OUTTA HERE!
The Stealth Eagle is about to fly.
Ditto for the Swooping Swallow.
Be the eagle. Be the eagle.
Be the swallow. Be the swallow...
The earth was hurtling toward us at seven hundred miles per hour, and we knew at that moment that we were facing death straight in the eye.
We could smell it's breath.
Bulk... why don't we give Mr. Peep here a chance to think it over?
A stellar idea, Skull.
Here you go! No pushing!
There's enough for everybody!
Uh... that's classified, top secret, confidential, undercover information.
If we told you -- we'd have to kill you.
There goes the neighborhood.
A real shame.
SKULL!!
BULK!!
And how do we do that?
By learning the ancient art of Ninjetti. It is the Genesis of what you on earth have come to know as the Ninja. It is the perfect union of mind, body and spirit.
It's... an eagle?
Look closer.
Look closer.
... A falcon?
... A falcon?
Tommy, you are the Falcon, Winged Lord of the Sky.
And how do we release the power?
The legend goes that you release the power with the power.
We never liked the cheesedongs in the first place.
Couldn''t stand them -- low-class all the way. And did you catch a whiff of their BREATH?! It's like having a conversation with a couple of ONIONS! Not to mention...
Hey, boss!
What kind of landing was that?! These clowns are a menace to the sky
As soon as we've taken over the world I'm gonna change my name to Sir Mordant. Or how about MAJOR Mordant?!
How about Major Moron?
Just shut your gap!
Did I say anything?
I'm outta here.
Wait for me!
GET OFF ME!
BUT I'M YOUR COUSIN!
BUT I'M YOUR COUSIN!
SECOND COUSIN, THREE TIMES REMOVED. NOW GET OFF ME!
Taking over the world is one thing. It's finding good help to run it for you that's the killer.
You want me to place a few calls?
No offense, boss, but they might find you a little disgusting.
Yes, well, I suppose you'd know a little something about that. Not to worry. I'll ever so gently lure them in and mold them into an army of devils! And what better way to entice them ... than with a little Ivan's Ooze?!
But boss, what about their parents?
Ah, the old and doddering. I'm going to SCOURGE their puny minds, reducing them to ZOMBIE'S. And then I'll put them to work rebuilding my empire.
Simon says...
Quack like a'duck!
What!
You forgot to say 'Simon says."
THE BOYS ARE BACK IN TOWN!!!
GO IVAN!!
Mordant, go with them and report back to me!
You know boss, I'd really like to help out but I've got this gastronomic condition which rules out all space trave--
That's right. And then we threw one of them off a mountain and another one into a raqing river!
So they've been destroyed?
"Basically".
What do you mean "basically"?
What do you mean "basically"?
Well... we were about to finish them off... when this huge monster came out of nowhere!
Did these sticks make a whistling sound?
How'd you know?
How'd you know?
Dulcea! That miserable, manipulating loathsome she-devil of a WITCH!!
What is THAT!
Feast your eyes upon the exoskeleton of the barbaric HORNITOR! KEEP DIGGING. THE DREADFUL SCORPITRON SHOULD BE CLOSE BY. ONCE I HAVE MY ECTO-MORPHICON MACHINES UP AND RUNNING, I SHALL ANNIHILATE ANGEL GROVE... AND THEN... THE WORLD
Don't you ever have anything nice to say?!
Well, if I did I certainly wouldn't say it to you!
Rrgh mmffpprr brghuh!!
How dare you?! Nobody shuts up Rita but me!
Isn't this just TYPICAL! We finally do somebody a good turn and just look what happens!
From now on it's E-V-I-L, NO exceptions!
I hope those Rangers put that lousy lowlife out of his misery!
GO POWER RANGERS!
That was a CHEAP shot!

I ain't mad. I ain't even surprised. But I can't let ya fuck me. On the other hand, if ya got needs beyond the thirty-five, I'll advance it to you against our next deal on the same terms.
Could we step outside?
I got my partner in there!
I cannot bear to look at that hideous suit one minute more.

Can't we get a couple whores over?
Four-twenty-eight.
What's that divided four ways?
Tommy Reina. Good pal. Better partner.
From your mouth ta God's ear.
From your mouth ta God's ear.
He's got a line on the good stuff.

But if ya can't catch the guys...
But Maranzano's got the men and the brains.
Which is why he doesn't need us.
Bastard didn't even show.
He's hidin'. Word's out Tommy Reina's goin' over ta Maranzano.
He's hidin'. Word's out Tommy Reina's goin' over ta Maranzano.
Get word to Maranzano. I want a meet. Alone. On neutral turf.
Masseria's confused. He can't figure whether you're workin' for Maranzano, or gettin' ready to kill the bastard. So he's spreadin' the word that you're goin' after Profaci because it happened on his turf. I figure Masseria's gonna try to rub out Profaci, and pin it on us. Then Maranzano will have to kill ya.
You got men on Profaci's place?
You got men on Profaci's place?
We got our boys paintin' the house next door. Around the clock. We're gonna keep old man Profaci alive if it takes twenty coats.
Masseria's tryin' ta find a way around ya. But his patience won't hold out much longer.
How's Bugsy doin'?
How's Bugsy doin'?
Tommy Reina's hauntin' his dreams. But he'll do his job.
Mad Dog Coll's in town on a job.
Who hired the bastard?
Who hired the bastard?
Maranzano. Ta ice you.
How much longer we gotta be shut up in this fuckin' sweatbox?
Long as Charlie says.
You ain't even a man yet.
That ain't what your mama said.
Where'd ya get this funny ravioli?
Ya ignorant Guinea, it's kreplach.
No disrespect, Tommy, but why would Mr. Arnold Rothstein wanna do business with bums like us?
Why ya always gotta go lookin' for a gift in the mouth of the horse?
I think Maranzano's talkin' a hell of a deal.
Sure, Frankie. Fuck me. Fuck Meyer. Fuck Arnold Rothstein who's made us all rich. All so you can be an fuckin' honorary Sicilian!
Sure, Frankie. Fuck me. Fuck Meyer. Fuck Arnold Rothstein who's made us all rich. All so you can be an fuckin' honorary Sicilian!
Does Maranzano have to kiss you on the lips before you'll take his goddamn money?
Does Maranzano have to kiss you on the lips before you'll take his goddamn money?
If he's gonna fuck me up the ass!
The deal's too good, Frankie
What are ya thinkin', Charlie?
A hundred-seven bucks too much. Any kid who drops an extra dime is gonna be talkin' to Moliari.
Ya mean we're so rich we're broke?
Well...
Mr. Costello handles our business with the government agencies.
Mr. Costello handles our business with the government agencies.
That's it.
I'm sorry, but I sleep better when I know I'm with the winning side.
We're gonna be the winning side. It's like Rothstein said about that guy in Austria. We're gonna use Maranzano and Masseria. Let 'em knock each other bloody. And then, when everybody's screamin' for peace, we step in to make it. What they're fight in' over, everybody will beg us to take.

No. They envy you.

If I look weak now, it's over.
I'm very sorry... I didn't...
I'm very sorry... I didn't...
Oh, God. Don't start actin' like a fuckin' wife on me.
A lot of shit came out of me in the hospital. I'm sorry you got hit by it.
You must be feeling better, if you're looking for sex again.
Would it be painful for you?
It always is.
Charlie?
I'm doin' business here!
I'm doin' business here!
But there's...
I'm gonna lose you, Charlie.
It'll all be over tomorrow. No more wars. No more killin'. Just livin' normal like everybody else. You'll be stuck with me for good.
Charlie!
I do this for you, and you'll leave me and my guys alone. Be the fuckin' Boss of all the other Bosses, but we are gonna be our own Bosses.
Come on, Charlie. We gotta have a top guy. Otherwise these wars ain't never gonna stop.
As long as ya got one top Boss, somebody else's always gonna be looking to knock him off. And that's war on top of war.

Charlie, I'm from the old country, and these American ways get me sometimes confused. You tellin' us you refuse the title of Boss of All the Bosses?
Charlie, I'm from the old country, and these American ways get me sometimes confused. You tellin' us you refuse the title of Boss of All the Bosses?
I don't care what anybody calls me, Joe. Long as it ain't to dirty. And if you fellas get together every year and say, "Charlie, we still want you to run things for us", I ain't gonna insult ya by sayin' no.
Julius Caesar never took no vote.
And maybe that's why he ended up dead in the streets of Rome.
You fellas got names?
Lansky. Meyer Lansky. And that's Bugsy Siegel ya got there.
Meyer just finished the books.
A million bucks. In the last six months.
Bugsy, you and I don't need to be in business with Maranzano. We got more jobs than we can handle. That's not the problem.
So what is the problem?
So what is the problem?
The minute we sell out to Maranzano, that bastard is gonna have you knocked off.
We'll figure out something.
I'm supposed to be at my old man's for Christmas dinner at eight.
At least Masseria plays by the rules. Maranzano thinks he's God, and the rules don't apply.
Without us, Masseria don't stand a chance, and he knows it.
Meyer.
It's nothin'. I'm gettin' married.
It's nothin'. I'm gettin' married.
Married? To Anna? You ain't got her in trouble?

Like a party for all our friends.
Like a party for all our friends.
Italians, Jews, Irish. One big party. Course, some guys don't get along.
Like Don Maranzano.
And if we don't invite Maranzano, we can't invite Masseria. Guys don't wanna be choosin' sides.

How soon can we pull this off?
How soon can we pull this off?
I'm gettin' married in six weeks. I'll already be in Atlantic City which is probably the best place to do it anyway.
Your honeymoon, Meyer?
Might as well put the time to use.
After all this time I'd think you'd know me better, Meyer.
It's not myself I'm worried about.
It's not myself I'm worried about.
I'll do fine.
You're getting' 10 cc's
I told you twenty!
You bastards, I said twenty!
It'll just be a few minutes.
It'll just be a few minutes.
I NEED THE TWENTY!
Tommy Reina's gone over to Maranzano, but so far Masseria ain't lifted a finger,
The fat man's scared. Scared of us, and scared without us. Same with Maranzano. We gotta get their minds back on each other. This fuckin' peace is killin' us.

We can get the war started tomorrow, but it won't be pretty.
Who?
Who?
Tommy Reina.
Meyer, ain't anybody ever told you ya look more like a bookkeeper than a fuckin' mobster?
What's your problem?
What's your problem?
It's just that Maranzano's the only bastard I ever heard brag about gettin' audited by the IRS. He came out clean, so he thinks his shit don't stink.
It's just that Maranzano's the only bastard I ever heard brag about gettin' audited by the IRS. He came out clean, so he thinks his shit don't stink.
Is there a fuckin' point comin' up anytime soon?

Seein' he loved the experience so much, I think we outta give him the pleasure again.
Yeah. So who the fuck does?
Come on. Tell us, Shitface.
Come off it, Bugs.
Come off it, Bugs.
Come off it, Bugs.
Ben-jamin.
We got exactly two choices, Maranzano or Masseria.
They don't give a shit about us!
What you mean? Tommy ain't done nothin'.
Maranzano will think Masseria ordered the hit, and won't have no choice but to start the war.
Maranzano will think Masseria ordered the hit, and won't have no choice but to start the war.
Why's it gotta be Tommy!
Why's it gotta be Tommy!
Masseria won't have any choice but to trust you. And as long as we keep the Boss alive, Maranzano can't win without you.
We're gonna change it, Bugs. Once we get rid of the Dons, the Commission's gonna rule. No more wars. No more vendettas. No more Boss of All the Bosses.
Yeah. And no more Tommy Reina.
If ever I need a Boss, Joe.
Yeah. Yeah. I bet ya feed Maranzano that same line.
I like that.
Whatta ya mean, Boss?
Whatta ya mean, Boss?
Ya piss like a man.
I'm glad ya come.

What's with the banquet? This is supposed to be a private meet.

You boys carryin' pieces?
You tryin' ta tell me something? I don't come to a meet with a weapon unless it's with an enemy.
You tryin' ta tell me something? I don't come to a meet with a weapon unless it's with an enemy.
See if these two are my friends.
You're a smart boy, Charlie, but there's somethin' you ain't learned yet. A man needs a family.
I know. When the storm hits, it don't pay to be caught outside.
I know. When the storm hits, it don't pay to be caught outside.
I got a place for you. In my family... or in the cemetery.
I got a place for you. In my family... or in the cemetery.
Never threaten me, Boss.
This business is about taking risks.
Calculated risks. But Boss, this one don't calculate.
Tommy tells me that Capone's coming in from Chicago.
He's trying to make it.
He's trying to make it.
He'll think something's wrong I ain't there.
He'll think something's wrong I ain't there.
He'll know you were smart enough to stay away, Boss.

You know that if you come, we gotta invite Maranzano.
You know that if you come, we gotta invite Maranzano.
So fuck him. I don't care anymore. Let him come.
So fuck him. I don't care anymore. Let him come.
So he can talk to all the families behind your back? Maybe have his own meet at 3:00 AM under the goddamn boardwalk? No. You're too smart for a sucker play.
Where we headed?
Wassa matter, Mr. Big Shot. Don't have time for my business no more?
Wassa matter, Mr. Big Shot. Don't have time for my business no more?
Boss, I got all the time you need.
Boss, I got all the time you need.
I know about you.
And what went on your little party in Atlantic City. I got ears.
That little party's gonna make you a lotta money.
That little party's gonna make you a lotta money.
MONEY DON'T MEAN SHIT!

Didn't know you felt that way.
You and Vito are gonna pull that payroll job. Right now.
You gotta plan these things.
You gotta plan these things.
And I got it all planned.
If I wanted ta kill ya, I woulda done it long ago. It's not like you ain't given me reason.
I'm still the Boss of All the Bosses! And you'll do what I say!

So tell me when I ain't done it.

You got no fuckin' choice. You might be able to stay alive, but you're never gonna win the war from these fuckin' rat holes.
You got no fuckin' choice. You might be able to stay alive, but you're never gonna win the war from these fuckin' rat holes.
Tell me, Charlie. Please.
Tell me, Charlie. Please.
Why should I go against you, Boss? Nobody can handle this business like you. Maranzano'll never know the crap that you forget. He's got no business bein' Boss. The idea makes me wanna puke. You're the Boss, an it's gonna stay that way.
What are ya thinkin'?
Joe Profaci. Carlo Gambino. Vinnie Mangano. Joe Bananas. They all gotta die.
Joe Profaci. Carlo Gambino. Vinnie Mangano. Joe Bananas. They all gotta die.
You can't fuck with them. They're heads of families!
You can't fuck with them. They're heads of families!
They're friends of our enemy.
They're friends of our enemy.
Take one of 'em out, and they'll all line up against us.
Take one of 'em out, and they'll all line up against us.
Not if they all die at once.
Every successor will owe his loyalty to us. Together we take out Maranzano, and each family gets a piece of his operation.
A mother-fuckin' peace conference.
We gotta talk in private. I got a friend in Coney Island who's gonna open his restaurant just for us.
But that's an hour's drive.
But that's an hour's drive.
Lobster Fra Diavolo. Spaghetti with red clam sauce. Antipasto. And pastry that'll make you wanna go home and slap your sweet mama.
Ya did good. I ain't seen the Boss so happy in weeks.
Look at this boy. He hardly eats. Like that fella killed Caesar.
When ya got all that blood workin' in your belly, it ain't upstairs where it needs to be.
The kid just called me stupid.
The kid just called me stupid.
Not stupid. Fat.
Not stupid. Fat.
Shit. When I was comin' up, bein' fat meant ya had somethin' ta eat. Guy looked like you, people felt sorry for 'em. Right, Gerardo?
Sure. But ya got a deck a cards? I wanna play some Klob.
Come on, Charlie. We got business.
Come on, Charlie. We got business.
Couple hands. No harm in it.
One move pardner, and you're a dead man.
You can't kill me. You gave your word, Charlie.
You can't kill me. You gave your word, Charlie.
So? I'll get Bugs ta do it.
Don Maranzano. Welcome.

I must know more of you, my son.
I must know more of you, my son.
Not a lot ta know.
Then perhaps you need to know me.
Don, I'd be honored.
Salvatore. My young Caesar. First me, Sallie. Then you.
The name's Charlie.
Mussolini is raping Sicily like every Roman before him. So our brothers are coming to America. Soldiers willing to fight and die. Men who know the meaning of honor.
Don, you talk about honor, but you mean vendetta. Killin' an' more killin' until nobody can remember how it all started.
And how many soldiers do you have?
I've got friends.
I've got friends.
I have six hundred. Soldiers. And more every week off the boat.
I have six hundred. Soldiers. And more every week off the boat.
An' Masseria's got seven hundred.
He's an animal!
He's the Boss of all the Bosses, and I respect him.
The Internal Revenue came to my offices. I turned over all my ledgers. They found nothing. Charlie, I am a businessman.
Sittin' around gives me the piles. You got a proposition?
We combine everything. You are my second in command.
What about the share.
What about the share.
You get fifteen percent.

I got partners.

Your Calabrian friend, I will accept. At least Costello eats pasta like us.
Your Calabrian friend, I will accept. At least Costello eats pasta like us.
And the Jews?

Share with them as you wish. Do business with them on your own. But no filthy Jew will ever be a brother to me.
Tell me, my son. Why did you go with Giuseppe? He's not our kind.
I found that out.
I found that out.
We learn from life.
We learn from life.
That's why I'm here.
That's why I'm here.
Coming with me will be a delicate matter. We will work it out. But Charlie...
Conditions have changed. Some people have become too powerful.
I'll take care of the Boss.
If you give him the chance, Lansky will betray you like Judas.
I don't fuck my partners.
I don't fuck my partners.
No worry, Charlie. I will kill them for you. No one will know.
At first, it will hurt you. But you will come to understand and we will be strong together.
You're fuckin' crazy. You're all fuckin' crazy!
Even the beasts of the earth know who rightfully reigns.
They do what I tell 'em.
They do what I tell 'em.
Salvatore. Always holding himself above.
Salvatore. Always holding himself above.
You and me both. Sal-va-to-re.
We must be friends, Charlie.
Keep my terms and I won't be your enemy.
Keep my terms and I won't be your enemy.
The terms will be mine.

The guy doin' the job names the price. If you don't like it, you can kill Masseria yourself.

I will be the Boss of All Bosses.
I will be the Boss of All Bosses.
What makes you think I give a damn about that Sicilian crap?
Tell it to the Calabrian. Tell it to the Jews.
You disrespect our tradition.
You disrespect our tradition.
Boss, we got our own tradition. We call it treatin' your friends right, and not bein' a pig for every scrap of glory.
Forget it. That's past.
No matter what you say to me Salvatore, you are my bambino.
Why didn't you tell me that Maranzano had made you an offer?
I turned him down flat.
And if I had known, I would have warned you to expect this. We could have prepared.
Masseria's been after me too.
Masseria's been after me too.
Thank you for keeping me informed.
Thank you for keeping me informed.
We were overdue to get hit.
We were overdue to get hit.
You think this is a coincidence? Next week half your customers will be buying their Scotch, our Scotch, from Maranzano. In a month, he'll be in Scotland talking to my distillers, because you can't move product. I'll be out of business, and you'll be working for Maranzano.

Okay. I'm listening.
Okay. I'm listening.
A hundred years ago Austria was run by a prince named Metternich. Austria was weak, and it's neighbors were strong. But they were ruled by passionate men, while Metternich was ruthless and brilliant. If one country got too strong, he rallied an alliance against it. He would lead all of Europe to the brink of war, then bring the enemies together and forge the
Strategy.

A peaceful and prosperous retirement.

Shuddup.
Shuddup.
Wanna know what I think?
Wanna know what I think?
Spare us.
Spare us.
I think these rich shits -- no offense Bobby -- are so dead below the waist that they gotta ride around all day swingin' at each other ta get their broads hot.
Those fucks can't leave each other alone. Maranzano and Masseria ain't gonna be satisfied until one of 'em starts a war.
Let 'em kill each other off! Why should we care?
Let 'em kill each other off! Why should we care?
There won't be any way to stay out of it.
Where's the stiff?
Come on. Be polite.
Sorry, Charlie. I gotta get my Johnson worked tonight.
Jesus.
Jesus.
Hell. It's been four days!
Forget it.
Fuck 'em.
Johnson's still on board. Even Maranzano won't screw with Nucky in Atlantic City. But everywhere else, we got nothing but problems.
I'll knock 'em in, Charlie. I can do it. Blow his fuckin' head off. Get rid of the bastard for good.
I'll knock 'em in, Charlie. I can do it. Blow his fuckin' head off. Get rid of the bastard for good.
You wouldn't live out the week.
Masseria's scared. He might make our deal.
We can't sell out to those guys. They ain't businessmen!
So we're gonna knock 'em both off?
If it comes to that. Yeah.
Maranzano wants you dead.
Yeah. But he needs me alive.
Everybody's talkin' about ya, Charlie. First time anybody ever got took for a ride and lived.
Guess I'm just lucky.
Guess I'm just lucky.
That's just what they're calling ya pal. Lucky Luciano.
I'm a hard guy. I done more jobs than alla you combined. And I never said no. Not once. But dammit I don't understand why the hell we gotta kill our friends!
Because the world ain't big enough for the Dons. So we gotta choose between our friends and ourselves. It ain't the way I'd make the world, but that's the way it is.
Yes?
I'm comin' for my twenty thousand.
I'm comin' for my twenty thousand.
Luciano is dead?
Luciano is dead?
Open a window. Every newsboy in town's screamin' about it.
What a cozy little scene.
Kill them! Kill them!
Kill them! Kill them!

This is nice. I mean it.
Now don't pick a fight. I'm staying over.
Oh, poor Buster. He hasn't been fed in a day and a half. Let me get some food...

When he first came in to the sleep lab?
When he first came in to the sleep lab?
Yeah...before your time.
Jesus, honey...he always joked about you <u>curing</u> him, but I never realized what you cured him <u>from</u>.
He hadn't gotten a good night's sleep in years. The nightmares would wake him up, and he'd start right in painting... <i></i> That boy looked like pluperfect hell.
How do you get from <u>here</u> - to <u>there</u>?
Switch hands.
Switch hands.
What?
What?
I'm serious. It was bicameral disjunction - right brain and left brain out of balance. He was a rightie, so I made him switch the pencil to his left hand. Just to see what'd come out.
Monkeybone?
Left-handed, he was <u>funny</u>. He'd been doing all this scary, intense work...then he found out he could draw this stuff, and make me laugh, and he liked that. <i></i> And then the nightmares just...stopped.

Julie, that stuff probably saved his life.

I can't explain this, Alice, but I'm not so sure it did. It's as if...he's <u>not Stu</u> any more. The Stu I love is gone! <i></i> He spends all his time in the garage. He says he's...autographing.
"4/17: Subject, when unaware of observation, prefers to hold eating utensils...with feet. Successfully carves turkey roll holding eating utensils...with feet."
They had a case like that at Johns Hopkins. Wires got crossed between hands and feet.

I was, uh, just getting ready to leave...
Yo, Jumbo. We got us some kind of <u>ventriloquist</u> here.

You're really gonna pop the question?
Got the ring. Got the airline tickets. Soon as they break that piñata, we'll grab a cab - and it's off to the land of palm trees and coconuts.

Sorry, Julie - won't be a minute. Now Stu - I know you don't like the idea, but you really ought to talk to these guys -
Julie and I - we were just gonna go...
Go? There's a potload of money here, pal. You got three major toy companies...you got the guys from Burger God over here...

What'll it do if they pull the plug?
The Nightmare Juice! It's gone! Somebody switched it for a beaker of grape Kool-Aid!!

Sorry, Steve, maybe next time. And how's our new guest settling in - ?
YOU SET ME UP!!
Easy, pal! I was coming to congratulate you. It ain't easy snatching one of those E-tickets. Steve here was the last guy to pull it off, and that musta been, what, 25 years ago...?
Why'd you do it? What'd I ever do to you?!?
Why'd you do it? What'd I ever do to you?!?
It's simple, Stu. We need nightmares - lots of 'em. So whenever we can swing it, we send a guy up to stimulate the flow...a <u>nightmare maker</u>! Like Steve here. Poe. Rasputin...we've been doing this all the way back to Atilla and Genghis Khan!

Oh, baby, I can't believe you're back.
Home sweet home, huh? Actually, I was expecting something a little swankier. How much loot does old Stu rake in, anyway?
Meaning me, of course. I'm referring to myself. You have to assume Monkeybone would be a pretty lucrative franchise...

I won't take it! See? I won't be party to murder. See? Steering a poor dope up blind alleys for that grafting Taylor mob is low enough. But helping that dame cut him up in little pieces besides--nobody's gonna make me do that. No, sir.

Well--let's dig up the preacher, kid.
Huh?
Huh?
You know, we're getting married.
You know, we're getting married.
Take me home, Diz.
He's cooked! They'll drum the poor lug out of that chamber tomorrow as sure as I'm--! And now they're all down on him. Yeah--my press pals, too--he's a bad egg--still water running deep. Boloney! It's the frame of all time! When I see a phoney like this--my journalist blood boils-- I wanna *fight*! Look, kid--rack your brains, will you? Haven't you got any confidential
I've told you ten times--if I had anything they couldn't bat down in a second, don't you suppose I'd've been up in that hearing yelling murder! Sure--he was cooked the night I sounded off like a fool and spilled the whole works!

Then--in the name of kindness to dumb animals--we can't let him walk into that Senate tomorrow and take a terrible punch in a nose! A couple of us went up there--told him all he could do was beat it--resign--clear out. But--he's in a daze--he's been hit by a ton of bricks. Just says, "I haven't done anything. Why should I resign?" He might *listen*

Well, then, that's great! And that's a great place to leave it! It's no use *my* barging into this now and--
The war's on!
He's a house-afire!
He's a house-afire!
Diz--get what he says to the people back in that State. It's up to you and the boys. Keep those wires hot. Fire away, pal!

Freedom of the press! Mr. James Taylor blindfolding a whole State-- Wait a minute! If that's how he wants to play *I'll* get through to that bunch--I'll get plenty of words into that, State--! Come on, Diz, get that stuff you've written--let me have it--

I'll bear that in mind... What? Oh. Dinner. Pet--my stomach couldn't hold a bird seed.
We're waiting, Hubert.
Really, my dear--I don't feel like a thing.
Nonsense.
Nonsense. Why don't you listen to your children for a change? You might actually learn something?
For instance, how to run the affairs of government? No doubt my children could make this appointment *for* me-- with the greatest ease!
I do *not* want a Senator. And I do *not* want any more of this nonsense! Emma!
Why, I think it's very sweet of the children--
Otis!
That settles it! I will not be attacked and belittled by my own children in my own home! My nerves are strained to the breaking point!
Emma! I'm a man at the end of his rope.
No wonder--without your dinner.

Well, your children are very bright-- and *they* say Jefferson Smith.

Oh! Go away.
Yes, yes--tell them I'll see them immediately--immediately! I can't hold them off! They want something to say about this appointment. Ten to one they've got a man.
Relax, Happy. Jim said to wait.

*You* tell Jim Taylor.
*You* tell Jim Taylor.
Washington! Always discussing the problems of Washington. Nobody ever thinks of the State--and my problems! I *will* tell Jim Taylor. It's high *time* I told him a thing or two!
Terrific! A born stooge! Horace'll perform like a trained seal.
Jim--if I fling a party man like Horace in the face of those angry committees--
He's batty!
Listen--the simpleton of all time--a big-eyed patriot--knows Washington and Lincoln by heart--stood at attention in the Governor's presence-- collects stray boys and cats--
Oh--oh.
He's the hero of fifty thousand boys and a hundred thousand parents. Look at these congratulations pouring in! I tell you, gentlemen, by this one statesman-like act, I have--
Look here, Jim--if you and Joe are going to gab about this appointment *any* longer, I'm going ahead and see those committees!
You'll see those committees when we're finished!
You'll see those committees when we're finished!
Yes, Jim.
One minute! Just one minute!
Happy, we've got the man. Horace Miller!
Happy, we've got the man. Horace Miller!
Horace Mill--!
Happy, for reasons there isn't time to go into--it's got to be Miller! We've given you the man. Now write the ticket. Come on, Joe. Come on, Chick.
Now, wait fellows--great Heavens. I've got to see those angry committees first--feel them out a little--work for harmony--harmony.
They put up *their* candidate? Who?
Henry Hill.
Henry Hill.
*Henry Hill?* That crackpot? That long-haired--! Why, you should have killed that so fast--!

I *won't* let you stand there callously and perhaps wreck my whole political future!
I *won't* let you stand there callously and perhaps wreck my whole political future!
*Your* political future! I bought it for you and made you a present. And I can grab it back so fast it'll make your head spin. You got a nerve to stand there and worry about just *your future* when we're in this spot! The man is--*Miller*.
--a *boy ranger* a squirrel chaser-- to the United States Senate!
Jim--the answer to a prayer--manna from heaven--the man *we want*--and the votes *we need*--
What!
Joe--*you* know what I'm talking about. The perfect man. Never in politics in his life. Wouldn't find out what it's all about in two *years*, lets alone two months. But the important thing--and this was the genius of the stroke--*it means votes*!
But you went ahead and made this appointment without asking me--
Jim--when the lightning hit, I--I just--
Jim--when the lightning hit, I--I just--
*But you never asked me*!
*But you never asked me*!
Oh--Jim!
Boy Ranger! The answer to a prayer. Manna from heaven! Didn't know the time of day--!
Will you please tell me *exactly* what he's done?
Will you please tell me *exactly* what he's done?
Yes! He's about to blow the whole machine to smithereens--and *you with it*, Mr. Governor!
Yes! He's about to blow the whole machine to smithereens--and *you with it*, Mr. Governor!
Me! Jim--how--?
Me! Jim--how--?
You couldn't understand! Listen, Ten Thumbs, I'll be on my way to Washington in half an hour. Whatever happens, I'm all ready for this Ranger of yours. Never mind how. You'll get your instructions from Ken Allen here. It isn't anything you have to do. I wouldn't trust you to lick a stamp. Allen'll do it himself. You just use your *high office* to

Y-yes, Jim.
I doubt it! Come on, Ken.
Now--now--please--that's quite all right. Relax, boys--
This--this is a great honor, sir. I-- I--
This--this is a great honor, sir. I-- I--
Not at all. I've come to pay you a personal and official--and I might say--a *tardy* tribute, Mr. Smith, for your recent heroic conduct.

Oh, now, I'm afraid that's been exaggerated some--

Well--that's not work, sir--that's fun.
Well--that's not work, sir--that's fun.
No doubt. No doubt. And this fine little paper--"Boy Stuff"--with, I dare say, an *enormous* circulation in the State.
Well--yes--I was saying--the State should reward you--
Aw--
Aw--
--And it is in my power to confer a very signal honor upon you. In my official capacity, therefore, I--

Ma! Hold him!
Thanks, Governor--*yes*! Do you mind? His head--Ma'll take the tail.
The--head?
The--head?
Just get one hand against each ear there--keep his face straight up.
What were you saying, Governor? Sorry.
I said, sir--in my official capacity-- as an honorary gesture--I appoint you to the United States Senate!
What's the matter, Dad? Is it getting you down?
Is *what* getting me down?
Gosh, Pop--head of the Boy Rangers!
Oh, a *boy*!
I did. What about it?
Well, Jeff put that out himself.
Well, Jeff put that out himself.
Himself!
"Boy Stuff." That's the name of Jeff's magazine. He prints it. Look--here's one--oh, it's great-- *everybody* reads it--all the kids in the State--a million of 'em. Look, Pop--let me read you a--
Peter, I'm in no mood to hear childish prattle!
He's the greatest *American* we got, too, Dad. Can tell what George Washington said--by heart. An' "Boy Stuff's" got the swellest stuff in it.
What stuff?
No, *sir*! You couldn't do better, Dad.
Than what?
Than what?
Jeff for Senator.

Emma! Will you *please*--?
A dirty frame!

Yes. Come in.
Yes. Come in.
Is--uh--Jefferson Smith at home?
Is--uh--Jefferson Smith at home?
Certainly. Step right in.
Well--it started with a little mimeograph sheet--and it's just grown out of all sense and reason--
Excellent! Excellent! My boy, I'm convinced our State has a great debt of gratitude to you--
Maybe you'd like to come along and watch, Governor? Jefferson's done a wonderful job with that leg.
Why, of course.
A pet shop?
Well, it sort of got to be--from Jeff just pullin' splinters and things--
I just can't, son--not the head and tail both!
Uh--could--could I help--?
Gee, I wouldn't appoint an old twerp like Horace Miller--Taylor or no Taylor!
Taylor! May I ask what *Taylor* has to do with it?
Taylor! May I ask what *Taylor* has to do with it?
Well, he's still running the show, ain't he, Dad?
Well, he's still running the show, ain't he, Dad?
Emma! I will not have conversations of this sort carried on by the children at dinner!
That's easy. Jefferson Smith.
I beg your pardon?
When Jeff gets through with Taylor, Pop--
When Jeff gets through with Taylor-- Quiet! What do you mean by breaking in here--? Get out! Get *out* of here!
Washington!
Yeah, for the fifth time, Senator-- Washington.
Yeah, for the fifth time, Senator-- Washington.

Boy! My head's like a balloon--for two whole days. I never knew there was so much American history.
Here they are--I got them. They are all right.
Well, that ends that crisis. This way, Senator.
All right, Senator--let's get these bags and the livestock together--
Look! There it is!
Look! There it is!
What? Who?
You should hear our Ranger Band rattle that off--if you want to *hear* something! Good evening, Miss Saunders. Good evening Mister McGann.
H'ya, Senator. I--I've sorta been looking for you--
H'ya, Senator. I--I've sorta been looking for you--
You have? Will you come in a minute, Miss Saunders.
Uh--Senator--I thought you and me might go out to dinner together--and grab off a few monuments.
Oh, I couldn't tonight. Thanks a lot.
He's a newspaper publisher I know-- and--
What makes you think he's got *anything* to do with it?
What makes you think he's got *anything* to do with it?

I addressed the Chair first, sir!
I addressed the Chair first, sir!
I am about to ask for a roll call on the passage of the Resolution--without further delay. The Senator can have nothing to say at this time that would not be either in bad grace or--
Will the Senator yield?
For a question!
For a question!
Has the gentleman the effrontery-- standing there convicted and in disgrace--to try to force the postponement of that bill--?
Has the gentleman the effrontery-- standing there convicted and in disgrace--to try to force the postponement of that bill--?
For one week!
For one week!
Is he fully aware that this bill has been months in both Houses--delayed and delayed--millions will be without food and shelter until its passage-- public works to relieve unemployment will be at a standstill--government agencies will be forced to suspend-- ?
Will the Senator yield for a question?
I yield.
I yield.
In view of the gentleman's touching concern for the Senators, would he permit a motion to recess until the morning--at which time he could continue to educate this august body with his profound babblings?
Well, it isn't much, but if you insist, here's this week's.
"Boy Stuff." Why, printer's ink runs in your veins, Jeff. You're just like your father.
"Boy Stuff." Why, printer's ink runs in your veins, Jeff. You're just like your father.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Even to the hat. Same old dreamer, too. One look at you and I can see him, back of his old roll top desk, hat and all, getting out his paper. Always kept his hat on his head so as to be ready to do battle. Clayton Smith, editor and publisher, and champion of lost causes.

No.
I mean, sir--if I'm going to stay in the Senate--I ought to know what I'm doing--at least, I ought to try to study the Bills that are coming up--
The *Bills*? Jeff--let me advise you-- as your father would--politics is a business--sometimes a cruel business. In your time here, you couldn't even start on those Bills. They're put together by legal minds--after a long study. Why, after twenty years, I can't understand half of them myself. No, really, Jeff--in your own interests--

--I may not know much about a lot of things, sir--but I know that Willet Creek country like a book--and--and I tell you, Senator Paine--there's something *wrong* about this dam-- why, there isn't a foot of water in that creek--it's dry four months out of the--

Jeff--listen--this was all taken up in the State Legislature and approved-- they're going to divert waters from up above--
But--there are a hundred other places in the state that *need* the water. Besides--I talked to Kenneth Allen, who owns some of that land--and he didn't say anything about a dam. No-- I'm sure, sir--there's something wrong--and I--I won't vote on this thing until I get a lot of questions answered--

Yes--the *benefits*! What's a man called Taylor got to do with this?
Y-yes.
Mr. President--gentlemen--I--I have risen to a painful duty--to say that, out of evidence that has come to my attention, I consider Senator Smith unworthy to address this body!
Yield *how*, sir?
Will he yield for a question?

The committee ruled otherwise! The gentleman stands guilty as charged. And I believe I speak for all the members when I say that no one cares to hear what a man of his condemned character has to say about *any* section of *any* legislation before this house!
Will the Senator--
I will not yield, sir! This same man-- Mister Taylor--came here to offer me a place in this Senate for twenty years, if I would vote for a dam that he knew and *I* knew was a *fraud*! But if I opened my mouth against it, he promised to break me in two! And I stood here one day and tried--I *started* to open

I *did* see Taylor! And I was in that room!
Yes, sir, I yield for a question.
The gentleman has said repeatedly that he is speaking to the people of his State. He has been waiting, as he so fancifully puts it, for them to come marching here in droves. Would the gentleman be interested in knowing what those people have to say?
Yes, sir, you bet I would.
Mr. President, have I permission to bring into this Chamber evidence of the response from my State?
Please, sir!--come with me!
No, Jeff--please--!
No, Jeff--please--!

Well. I hear you've been right on your toes since you got here. Pitching right in. Lots of people took you for dumb--but they're wrong. You're smart. In fact, *I* think you're smart enough to understand a situation when it's explained to you--

What is your interest in this, Mr. Taylor?
Mine? Why--naturally--whatever benefits the state is mighty important to me--owning a lot of its industry-- newspapers and other odds and ends. And if I thought you had the welfare of the state at heart, like myself-- for instance, if you were to turn around and help a project like this along instead of standing in the way-- why, I'd say you were a man

Now, if you're ready, Senator, we can start for the hotel. I'll *see* that you get there.
Yes--I think maybe you'd better.
Whose statue is that?

Do you want to dictate them?
Do you want to dictate them?
The letters? Gosh--no. I couldn't talk letters. I've gotta scratch 'em out. And say--I'm going to tell Ma all about you. If I tell it right-- the first thing you know you're going to get the best jar of preserves you ever tasted.

Thanks a lot.
Thanks a lot.
Oh--*Saunders*!
I--I--gee whiz--I didn't thank you!
Don't mention it--
Don't mention it--
I mean it. I--without you, I could't've--
Yes--right here. Just a second-- Miss Paine.
*Who*! Miss--! Is that--? Why didn't you--? Holy smoke; H-hello... Yes, Miss Paine... How-- how are you, Miss Paine...? What?... Escort *you* Gee--I mean--*sure*-- *yes*! I'd be--. Reception for a *princess*! Gosh!... Thanks, Miss Paine. Yes. I--I'll be there! Goodbye, Miss Paine. Did you hear that?--Escort Susan Paine--reception for a princess! Imagine her calling me--asking *me*-- !

Get your hat, Senator. We've got a lot to do between now and tomorrow--
Get your hat, Senator. We've got a lot to do between now and tomorrow--
Wow!
I know. Don't tell me. It was a wonderful party. Your suit went over big. And she looked beautiful, and she gave her hand when you left her-- and said--"Thank you, Mr. Smith." Oh, but it was the way she *said* it. You like to fell through the floor--Horseradish!
Saunders--!
Saunders--!
And you're writing Ma all about it. And your pigeons will carry the message of love. And the first thing you know--Susan Paine'll get the best jar of preserves she ever tasted!

Are you drunk?
Hello.
Saunders--
Well gee--how--how've you been, Saunders? I--I haven't seen you in-- . I suppose--now that you're married--
I'm not.
No. That night--I--well, *you* know-- I was pretty--. No--Diz is a--a sort of brother, that's all--
That's funny. I thought all along-- Gee--I--I'm glad to see you. I *thought* of you--I mean--I wanted to talk to someone and--well-- --Mr. Lincoln hasn't much to say-- Saunders--I'm not fit to sit up in the Senate--haven't you heard?--I robbed boys of their pennies and dimes!
What are you going to do?
I--I don't know. I--I'm afraid they've got me licked.
It might save some of the pieces, Jeff. It would leave a doubt about the whole thing--about you. Might blow over, this way.
Yeah. I see. Well--that's about the only thing to do. Don't you think?
Yeah. I see. Well--that's about the only thing to do. Don't you think?
Well, I guess it's a chance.
Well, I guess it's a chance.
Yeah. I guess--sometimes--Senator Paine must be right. Sometimes you-- you got to compromise a little-- And if you say so too, Saunders--if *you* think that's the thing to do--
Yeah. I guess--sometimes--Senator Paine must be right. Sometimes you-- you got to compromise a little-- And if you say so too, Saunders--if *you* think that's the thing to do--
I *don't* think that's the thing to do! No! I think what you ought to do is--*fight*!
I *don't* think that's the thing to do! No! I think what you ought to do is--*fight*!
Wait--
Wait--
What you *have* to do is fight!
What you *have* to do is fight!
But--I've done everything I--
But--I've done everything I--
I don't care *what* you've done! Don't quit. Don't grab a measly chance like this to save a few pieces--other men could--but not you. As long as you lived, you'd remember you ran out and threw this country of yours to the jackals--!

Oh--Saunders--
Oh--Saunders--
Jeff--listen--remember the day you got here?--what you said about Mr. Lincoln?--that he was sitting up there--watching--waiting for someone to come along? Well--that was *you*. Someone with a little plain, decent, uncompromising *rightness*--to root out the Taylors--yeah, and really light up that dome for once. This country could use some of that--so could the whole drunken, cockeyed world right now--a *lot* of it! And when

Saunders--if there was *any* way--
We'll *find* one! Only throw compromise out of the window--stick to Jeff Smith, the man who first came to this town--get up and *fight*-- and we'll find *some* way. I don't know where we'll wind up--but the flag'll be flying--!
Yay!
Hurray!
Hurray!
Where do we go from here?
Where do we go from here?
To a hard night's work, son. Come on!
Jeff--wait--they want you to speak!
Not *me*! Joseph Paine is the man they ought to be listening to! Come on!
Tell us about yourself, Senator! Hear you got a Boy's Club back home! Any ideas? Going to make things hum in the Senate, huh?
Hold on, fellows--I'm not used to more then one question at a time--
Ah! That's more like it! What?
Well--for a couple of years now--I-- I've thought it would be a wonderful thing to have a National Boys' Camp out in our State--
Well--for a couple of years now--I-- I've thought it would be a wonderful thing to have a National Boys' Camp out in our State--
A camp! Well!
A camp! Well!
You see--if we could take the poor kids off the streets--out of cities-- a few months in the summer--learn something about Nature and American ideals--
*Gentlemen*! Gentlemen are supposed to believe in something decent. Instead of twisting facts and making a joke of everything--why don't you tell the people the *truth* for a change?
The truth! Well, the man wants the truth! "What *is* truth?" asked so-and-so, and turned away!
The truth! Well, the man wants the truth! "What *is* truth?" asked so-and-so, and turned away!
That's what I said--the *truth*!
Whoa! Hold it! Pipe down! Come on, now--that's enough of that.
If you thought as much of being honest-- as you do of being smart--!
Just for the fun of it.--You see the one that makes it back home in the fastest time, I am going to enter in the nationals.
Wonderful!
Sure.
Well, we *must* see a lot of you, Senator. Come, Father.
How--how do you do, Miss Paine? I--I apologize for looking like this-- I--I have to be going now--
How are the pigeons?
How are the pigeons?
Fine--they're fine. Oh, Miss Paine, I--I want to apologize-- what the papers said I said about you--that wasn't true. I--I would never say a thing like that.
Fine--they're fine. Oh, Miss Paine, I--I want to apologize-- what the papers said I said about you--that wasn't true. I--I would never say a thing like that.
Did you hear, Father? He didn't mean it when he said I was beautiful.
Did you hear, Father? He didn't mean it when he said I was beautiful.
Oh--you are!
Oh--you are!
Then you *did* say it.
Then you *did* say it.
No--I mean--yes--that is--
Well, goodbye, sir--and thank you again. Well--it--it was nice seeing you, Miss Paine--
Goodnight, Senator--
I--I'm awfully glad to be--that is, it was nice of you to-- Uh--how's your father?
Splendid.
Splendid.
Uh--that's good. And--uh--you?
Uh--that's good. And--uh--you?
I'm splendid, too.
I'm splendid, too.
That's--that's splendid.
That's--that's splendid.
And how's your bill, Senator?
And how's your bill, Senator?
Oh, the bill. Oh--splendid--I mean-- I--I just can't seem to talk in this suit. I'll tell you a secret. It's brand new.
Oh, the bill. Oh--splendid--I mean-- I--I just can't seem to talk in this suit. I'll tell you a secret. It's brand new.
Well! You don't say!
Well! You don't say!
It's just as well to tell you--because if we're going to get off on the right foot--I mean--in case I act sort of strange--it's the suit.
It's just as well to tell you--because if we're going to get off on the right foot--I mean--in case I act sort of strange--it's the suit.
Well--I--
Well--I--
Funnier things have happened. Ma says when Pa was courting her, he acted strange for months. Didn't make sense--or anything. And one day, on a hunch, Ma said: "Clayton, so help me, you talk like a man whose collar is too tight to bear." "Not the collar, Mary," he said, "my shoes." "Well, for land's sake," Ma said, "Take the pesky things off!" Which

You're not going to take your *suit* off!
You're not going to take your *suit* off!
No! No! Gosh. See, there you are! I'm not making sense!
I don't understand, sir! I don't know what the gentleman--
The Senator has no voice in this chamber until the oath of office has been administered!
"I do solemnly swear--that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States--against all enemies, foreign and domestic--that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same--that I take this obligation freely--without and mental reservation and purpose of evasion-- and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help
"So help me God."
"So help me God."
Senator, you can talk all you want to, now.
The chair recognizes the rather strong- lunged junior Senator, Mr. Smith.
I--I'm sorry, sir. I--I have a bill--
The Senator understands he is limited to five minutes?
Yes, sir--
However, Senator Smith is still a member of this Body and as such has equal claim on the attention of the Chair--
You were about to recognize me, sir--
You were about to recognize me, sir--
That is merely your *impression*, Senator. The Chair has yet to settle the question to its own satisfaction!
Order, gentlemen!
Mr. President--I stand guilty as *framed*! Because Section Forty is graft, and I was ready to say so. I was ready to tell you that one man in my state--Mister James Taylor-- was putting that dam through for his own profit!
Uh--Mr. President--you and I are about to be alone in here, sir. I'm not complaining for social reasons, but it'd be a pity if the gentlemen missed any of this. Mr. President--I call the chair's attention to Rule Five of the Standing Rules of the Senate Section Three. "If it shall be found that a quorum is not present, a majority of the Senators
Ring the call to quorum.
"--We hold these truths to be self- evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights--" Well--looks like the night shift's comin' on.
The Senator will please suspend until order is restored in the chamber.
Well, now--I wouldn't know about that. Mr. President--what happens to me in the morning--I mean about my having this floor to go on babbling?
If the Senator permits this motion to recess he will not have the floor in the morning to babble or anything else, unless he is recognized first by the Chair.
Since the time of Adams--not Washington.
How's that, buddy?
How's that, buddy?
I said--I mean--Washington didn't live to see it finished. Congress didn't move here from Philadelphia till eighteen hundred.
I said--I mean--Washington didn't live to see it finished. Congress didn't move here from Philadelphia till eighteen hundred.
Oh--you're *sure* of that now?
Oh--you're *sure* of that now?
Yes. Washington laid the cornerstone though--wearing an apron for the ceremony that was embroidered by Madame Lafayette--
Yes. Washington laid the cornerstone though--wearing an apron for the ceremony that was embroidered by Madame Lafayette--
Yes, *sir*. Let's *go* Henry.
One moment, friends, let's give the Senator a break. Now, where'd you say you studied law?
Well--I haven't needed much law so far--what I'd like to get first is a little common sense--
Well--I haven't needed much law so far--what I'd like to get first is a little common sense--
Swell!
Ax?
A pet idea--you know--pension bill-- save the buffalo--you've got *one* notion you think would be good for this country, haven't you?
A pet idea--you know--pension bill-- save the buffalo--you've got *one* notion you think would be good for this country, haven't you?
Well--I have got *one* idea--
Marvelous! And what would this camp set the Government back?
Oh--nothing--nothing. My idea is-- for the Government to lend us the money--and the boys'll pay it back-- sending in a penny or a nickel--no more than a dime--no, gosh--the Government's got enough on its hands without--
Oh--nothing--nothing. My idea is-- for the Government to lend us the money--and the boys'll pay it back-- sending in a penny or a nickel--no more than a dime--no, gosh--the Government's got enough on its hands without--
Great! The Government's putting dough in too many places *now*!
Yeah! How about it? You're a nature lover. Do you handle any of that sign language?
Well--I can *manage*--
Well! Hear anything? Any sign of him?
How'd you like a punch in the nose?

That's what he's been doing since last heard from.

Whaddaya mean! What did *I* have to do with it? I don't blame the guy. Wow! Twenty-four hours in this town and nothing but dog-fights! And things aren't bad enough--last night I have to get a run-around from some wise dame--

Yeah? Well, when I get my hands on a red-headed doll with a southern lingo, I'll--
I wouldn't wait if I were you.
What do you mean? What's going on?
What do you mean? What's going on?
The Head Man's writing a Bill.

A Bill! Not *him*!
What does he want to--? What's *he* doing writing a Bill?
Why, he's a Senator, isn't he? I'm surprised at you, Mister McGann--
You can't find it in racing forms, Chick.
Fine thing Jim Taylor wished on me-- show him the monuments--I need this job like I need ten pounds.
Here, Jeff, I'll advance it for you.-- Fine introduction to the nation's capital!
Here, I'll take a dozen of those things. Miss Paine.
H'ya, Carl--h'ya, Bill!
Jeff--meet Mr. Cook and Mr. Griffith-- members of our State headquarters here.
Chick--
I've got 'im, Joe. Be right along.
Eleven B Street, Northeast. Take his bags and your own right over--and get yourself a room in the same place--
Listen, Joe--at least--after a day like this--I got one good bust coming before I start showing him monuments--
Joe--drop everything and come with me!
What's the matter?
Joe! You *told* him to!
Yes--a camp bill that will never get beyond a first reading. So calm down, Chick--and--goodnight.
Did I hear right? Did he say *Willet Creek*?
Let's get away from here.
Let's get away from here.
That's dynamite, Joe!
--amazing coincidence! Of all places in the world--to choose Willet Creek for his boys' camp!
Joe--I'm getting leery of this guy. We keep calling him dumb--and he keeps winding up in our hair! I'm telling you--when he finds out there's a dam going up where he wants his camp, he's gonna start asking questions six ways from Sunday--
Joe--I'm getting leery of this guy. We keep calling him dumb--and he keeps winding up in our hair! I'm telling you--when he finds out there's a dam going up where he wants his camp, he's gonna start asking questions six ways from Sunday--
Be quiet, Chick--I'm trying to think-- This Deficiency Bill is going to be read in the Senate tomorrow.
Be quiet, Chick--I'm trying to think-- This Deficiency Bill is going to be read in the Senate tomorrow.
Tomorrow! Joe--he'll hear the section on Willet Dam. He can't be there!
Tomorrow! Joe--he'll hear the section on Willet Dam. He can't be there!
I know that.

Listen--tomorrow I take him to see monuments--if I have to hit him over the head with a couple!

Joe--listen--all Susan has to do is turn those big eyes on him--he'll fall all over himself--just keep him out of there *one afternoon*--while they read that bill--
--I've used every argument in the world to try to turn him off. He just keeps coming back to the dam-- and what he knows--
Saunders! I'd like to tie her in a sack and drop her from the Brooklyn Bridge--
Saunders! I'd like to tie her in a sack and drop her from the Brooklyn Bridge--
--now he wants to talk to the Congressmen from the Willet Creek districts--he's run their names down--
Your Ranger's on the garbage pile, Happy! He's done for!
Shut up! You've *got* the man pilloried! Do you have to dance around him like a cannibal--!
Who? Who? Your boss! A nut, huh? A nut! Wow! There's a *story* in this guy--! I smelled it!
Go away, Nosey.
Go away, Nosey.
Saunders--it's meat and drink--lemme at 'im! Five minutes--! I'll make it right with you!
What do I *mean*, huh? Uh--*I'll* tell ya--World's Series--a pass! In a month it's worth fifteen bucks!
Well, well!
Look, Nosey--your pals would like to get in on this, wouldn't they?
Hey--I wanna *scoop*!
Hey--I wanna *scoop*!
Well, that's out. Either it's *lots* of reporters and *lots* of tickets or--. Now will you go and call 'em before I change my mind about the whole thing!
Well, that's out. Either it's *lots* of reporters and *lots* of tickets or--. Now will you go and call 'em before I change my mind about the whole thing!
Okay. See you here.
You want to see me, Senator?
Yes. Good morning, Saunders. Have you--uh--any idea how this happened?
Yes. Good morning, Saunders. Have you--uh--any idea how this happened?
The ranger's notices? No idea at all.
The ranger's notices? No idea at all.
No?
No?
No--I'm sorry. I merely saw him home. I'm not supposed to tuck him in and give him his bottle. That's McGann's job.
No--I'm sorry. I merely saw him home. I'm not supposed to tuck him in and give him his bottle. That's McGann's job.
By the way, Mr. McGann just phoned-- in a high fever. Smith's gone again. Have you any idea where?

Yes. He went to Mount Vernon to give himself a patriotic address.

Well--that's very fine. Saunders, some person in your office says you've quit--

That's right.
That's right.
Oh, now--that won't do--

Look, Senator--I wasn't given a brain just to tell a Boy Ranger what time it is. What do you need me for? Get somebody else--get a registered nurse--

No?
No?
You see--Governor Hopper made an appointment in this case that--well, Jeff isn't exactly fitted to the work, let's say. He's here to see monuments--and pass the time. That's important to--to my work--and everybody concerned. So, someone who can be trusted has to occupy him and keep him out of trouble--

And I'm an old hand at following instructions--
You're more than that. I've had example of the fact that wild horses couldn't pull confidential matter in these two offices out of you. That's why I tell you what I do--about Smith and this situation. So, you see--

Yeah--I see I'm right where I've been for seven years--
You deserve a lot better. And I'll tell you what we'll do. Stay and play nurse, as you say--and if certain things happen I'm taking everybody up with me, and you'll get one of the biggest jobs in Washington.

I see. All right. You finish this job properly--and you get a handsome bonus besides--
What do you want, Senator?
Saunders--it's going to go pretty bad for Jeff tomorrow. There's only one thing that can be done for him now-- I--I've written his resignation. He resigns under protest--denying all charges. No one will ever be sure if he was guilty or not. It leaves him with at least a shred of honor. The other way--branded openly in the Senate--expelled--he'll never live it down. Rather

What are you talking about? What difference--?

All right--*yes*! And what does that make me to him? *Nothing*! I've got to go about my own business--and forget it!
All right--*yes*! And what does that make me to him? *Nothing*! I've got to go about my own business--and forget it!
I thought I could, too. *My* business--this fine future! I have no future I *care* about, if this boy is broken! I--I can't sleep. The only important thing in my life now is to save what I can for him. I want him to get a start again--I'll see that he's taken care of as long as he lives--!

So I go right back where I was-- carrying compromises--covering up-- back to political tricks--this time for--! No! I was just getting rid of all that. If I did *anything*, I ought to go and tell him to stand up and--. No! I don't want any part of it! Smith or anything else! I'm all through. I want to be left alone!
Every word that boy said is the truth! I'm not fit for office! I'm not fit for any place of honor or trust in this land! Expel me--!
He did it.
That Happy Hopper is tougher to handle than a prima-donna.
--in other words, Jim--with this Willet Creek Dam on the fire--the man who goes to the Senate now in Sam Foley's place can't ask any questions or talk out of turn. We must be absolutely sure of him.

How much does the Willet Dam mean to you, Jim?

Joe--I've got a lot of people to take care of in this State.

I know, but is it worth the risk of a scandal now that a new man is going to the Senate?
I know, but is it worth the risk of a scandal now that a new man is going to the Senate?
Joe--what's the matter with you-- where you're concerned, I wouldn't take the slightest risk--'specially now after the great reputation you've made in the Senate. Why, look at this campaign I've started for you in all my papers. You're the logical man from the West on the National ticket--at the convention, anything can happen--
Joe, that's coming a long way in twenty years since I met you practising law down there in Main Street.
Jim--if what you say about the future is remotely possible--why not do as I say--drop things like this dam?
Jim--if what you say about the future is remotely possible--why not do as I say--drop things like this dam?
We can't drop it now, Joe. We bought the land around this Dam and we're holding it in dummy names. If we drop it or delay it--we are going to bring about investigations, and investigations will show that we own that land and are trying to sell it to the State under phoney names. No, Joe, in my judgment the only thing to do

Well, then appoint Miller--if you're sure he'll take orders.
Well, then appoint Miller--if you're sure he'll take orders.
Don't worry about Horace--he'll take orders. Come on--
Wait a minute, boys. Happy may have hit on something tremendous here. Rather than let Miller or anyone else in at this stage, we simply put blinders on this simple son of nature-- and turn him loose on monuments. He's completely out of the way in Washington, and as Happy says, you make political capital out of it at home.
Joe--do you mean to say--do you think you can actually *handle* this--this whatever-you-call-it in Washington?
Joe--do you mean to say--do you think you can actually *handle* this--this whatever-you-call-it in Washington?
A young patriot?--Who recites Jefferson and Lincoln?--turned loose in our nation's capital? I think I can.
A young patriot?--Who recites Jefferson and Lincoln?--turned loose in our nation's capital? I think I can.
Chick--turn the ballyhoo boys loose on this right away. Greatest appointment ever made. A banquet-- declare a holiday.
That's him. Let him in.
Wait a minute--Jim--you didn't ask *Smith* over here!
Wait a minute--Jim--you didn't ask *Smith* over here!
What do you think?
What do you think?
Jim, you can't come here and pull that steamroller stuff. Your methods won't do here. This boy is a Senator, however it happened, he's a Senator. This is Washington.

Steamroller stuff, Joe? My methods don't go in Washington? They've done pretty well by now, haven't they?
Steamroller stuff, Joe? My methods don't go in Washington? They've done pretty well by now, haven't they?
Oh, Jim, that's beside the point. This boy's different. He's honest and beside he thinks the world of me. We can't do this to him.
Oh, Jim, that's beside the point. This boy's different. He's honest and beside he thinks the world of me. We can't do this to him.
Well, what do you want me to do? Stand around like you chump and let that drooling infant wrap that Willet Creek Dam appropriation around my neck. Either he falls in line with us and behaves himself or I'll break him so wide open they'll never be able to find the pieces.

I don't want any part of crucifying this boy.
I don't want any part of crucifying this boy.
Oh, I see. Out steamroller methods are getting too hard to your sensitive soul, is that it, Joe? The Silver Knight is getting to big for us. My methods have been all right for the past twenty years, Joe, since I picked you out of a fly-specked hole in the wall and blew you up to look like a Senator, and now you can't

Jim, you don't have to--
Jim, you don't have to--
Oh, it's all right--it's all right. It seems a shame, though, to part company like this after all these years, especially now with a national convention coming up. Joe, I've put everything I have behind you. And so did all of our friends, but I guess we'll survive. We'll just have to find somebody else that's got a little more sense, that's all. In

Jim, it's just that I like the kid-- I don't want to see you get too rough on him.
Jim, it's just that I like the kid-- I don't want to see you get too rough on him.
I'm glad to see you come to your senses. You had me scared there for a minute, thought. Let him in.
Jeff--this is Mr. Taylor.
Glad to know you, Senator. Meet the boys--
Glad to know you, Senator. Meet the boys--
Congressmen, Radner, Schultz, Diggs--
Jim!
Just a minute, Joe!
Just a minute, Joe!
You can't say *that* to--
You can't say *that* to--
*I* know what I'm doing! I'll say what I *want*!
It's in your lap, Joe. Keep an eye on him. If he gets to his feet and says anything--
It's crucifying him--!
It's crucifying him--!
Anything *better* to offer?
Anything *better* to offer?
Maybe he won't get up.
Maybe he won't get up.
But--if he *does*, Joe--
Hey--Joe! Where you going? We've got to celebrate tonight!
No--I--I'll take a walk--
Jim--the boy's talking to that State-- the story is out--!
Sure! The fight's in the open now-- to a finish--!
Sure! The fight's in the open now-- to a finish--!
And if he can raise public opinion against us--if any *part* of this sticks--
And if he can raise public opinion against us--if any *part* of this sticks--
He won't get started! I'll *make* public opinion out there in five hours. I've done it all my life! I'll blacken this punk until-- Joe--your job is back in the Senate-- keep those men fighting him *there*.
He won't get started! I'll *make* public opinion out there in five hours. I've done it all my life! I'll blacken this punk until-- Joe--your job is back in the Senate-- keep those men fighting him *there*.
I hit him from the floor with everything I knew!
I hit him from the floor with everything I knew!
Keep doing it! This is the whole works, Joe--we're out of business of bigger than we then we ever were. We can't miss a trick--we can't stop at *anything*--till this yokel's smashed up and buried so deep he'll never--!
Here, here, Susan--this is Jeff Smith-- our new Senator.
I don't care to meet anybody until I get paid--come on--come on. One dollar each, please, for the Milk Fund.
How nice.
All right, we'll take Jeff with us--
All right, we'll take Jeff with us--
I'm afraid we won't have room in the car, Father. Senator Smith can follow with Mr. McGann and the pigeons.
His first 'whiff'!
Such pretty knees for a big boy!
Such pretty knees for a big boy!
Do I actually *see* this--?
Do I actually *see* this--?
Listen, Father! "Young Lochinvar smitten with Susan Paine"!
Father--oh.
Jefferson dropped in for a minute, Susan.
Jefferson dropped in for a minute, Susan.
How nice. How do you do, Senator?
Well, at the expense of some of the furniture, Susan--you've made another conquest.
What! Not Ol' Honest Abe!
What! Not Ol' Honest Abe!
And Honest Abe's ideals. A rare man-- these days.
Mr. President...
Senator Paine.
Senator Paine.
I present the credentials of Honorable Jefferson Smith who has just been appointed Senator by the Governor of my state.
Mr. President! Will the Senator yield?
Will Senator Smith yield to--?
Will the Senator yield?
Order! Will Senator Smith yield to--?
Senator Paine will state it!
It was *I* who rose in this Chamber to accuse him. He is saying that I was carrying out criminal orders on falsified evidence--
I accuse this man--by his tone--by his careful denials--he is deliberately trying to plant damaging impressions of my conduct--! *I'll* tell you why we were in tht room. Because Mr. Taylor, a respected citizen of our State, had brought with him the evidence against this man, later presented from this floor, and *we were urging him to resign*-- !
Order!
Order!
--to avoid bringing disgrace upon a clean and honorable State!
Order!
Finally, there was only one answer to a man like him--the truth--which I rose and gave to this body! Mr. President--he has told lie upon lie--every lie a desperate attempt to conceal his own guilt. And now, he is trying to blackmail this Senate-- as he tried to blackmail me! To prevent his expulsion, he would probably even try to hold up this Deficiency
Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?
Will Senator Smith yield to his colleague?
Is there objection? You may proceed, Senator.
Page boys!
No. Don't ever want to go out without telling us.
Who are you?
Yeah, Mr. Cobb said stick to your tail no matter what.
That's very nice of Mr. Cobb - but I don't want anybody sticking to my tail no matter what.
That's going to be fun.
Some people like it.
Put that away, slug! At your service!
I got a trunk in that room. Will you get it out for me?
I got a trunk in that room. Will you get it out for me?
Certainly.
Good morning.
Morning, neighbors. Morning.
I say, my friend, do you know a fellow by the name of Longfellow Deeds?
Deeds?
Deeds?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes, sir. Yes, indeedy. Everyone knows Deeds.
Yes, sir. Yes, indeedy. Everyone knows Deeds.
Yes, I
We'd like to get in touch with him. It's very important.
Who's that?
Who's that?
Deeds! Who do you think I'm talking about?
Deeds! Who do you think I'm talking about?
Oh, yes - Deeds. Fine fellow. Very democratic. You won't have no trouble at all. Talk to anybody.
Since he was born.
Yes. Elsie Taggart was the midwife.
Yes. Elsie Taggart was the midwife.
He was a seven-months baby.
Most every day.
Sometimes twice.
They think he's pixilated.
Oh yes, pixilated.
Pixilated.
Uh-huh.
He walks in the rain, without his hat, and talks to himself.
Sometimes he whistles.
Sometimes he whistles.
And sings.
For no reason, I guess. He always does it. We always run into the house when we see him coming.
Never can tell what he's going to do.
Never can tell what he's going to do.
He sure is pixilated.
He sure is pixilated.
Oh, yes - he's pixilated all right.
Why, you own it, Longfellow.
Yes, you own it.
Why, you've always been pixilated, Longfellow.
Always.
Why, everybody in Mandrake Falls in pixilated - except us.
Uh-huh.
Oh, yes.
Yes, indeedy.
He's still pixilated.
He sure is.
Are you married?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Any children?
Any children?
No, no children.
No, no children.
All right, Mr. Dodsworth. I think you'll qualify. Take this to that desk over there for further instructions.
All right, Mr. Dodsworth. I think you'll qualify. Take this to that desk over there for further instructions.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
Next, please.
No. Are you?
No.
No.
You don't go out with girls very much, do you?
You don't go out with girls very much, do you?
I haven't.
I haven't.
Why not?
I don't mind though. I had a lot of fun doing it.
Would you like to go for a walk?
It's obviously a frameup! They're trying to railroad this man for the money they can get out of him!
Your Honor!
Thank you, Your Honor. Are you employed by the Morning Mail?
No!
You are under oath, Miss Bennett. I ask you again - are you employed by the Morning Mail?
No! I resigned last week!
Were you given an assignment to follow the activities of Longfellow Deeds?
Yes.
Yes.
Did you subsequently write a series of articles about him?
Did you subsequently write a series of articles about him?
Yes!
Yes!
Are these the articles?

Yes!
Yes!
Were you present when all these things took place?

Yes!
Yes!
Are they true!

NO!!
NO!!
But they did take place?

They're colored! Just to make him look silly!
They're colored! Just to make him look silly!
And you saw them happen?
And you saw them happen?
Yes, but I
Yes, but I
That's all, Miss Bennett.
That's all, Miss Bennett.
It isn't all! I'd like to explain
It isn't all! I'd like to explain
That's all, Miss Bennett. That's all.
Oh, thank you!
Your Honor, what she is saying has no bearing on the case. I object.
Your Honor, this is absurd. The woman's obviously in love with him.
What's that got to do with it?
What's that got to do with it?
Well, you are in love with him, aren't you?
Well, you are in love with him, aren't you?
What's that got to do with it?
What's that got to do with it?
You are , aren't you?
You are , aren't you?
Yes!!!
You fainted.
Oh, did I? I'm sorry . . .
No, thank you. I'll be all right.
Look, this is my house. I'd like to
Look, this is my house. I'd like to
Oh, no, really - I'll be all right.
Oh, no, really - I'll be all right.
What happened?
What happened?
Well, I guess I walked too much. I've been looking for a job all day. I found one, too. I start tomorrow. You've been awfully kind. Thank you very much.
Feel better now?
Mmm, it tastes so good. Mr. Deeds, I don't know how I can ever thank you.
Mmm, it tastes so good. Mr. Deeds, I don't know how I can ever thank you.
Tell me more about yourself.
Tell me more about yourself.
Well, I guess I've told you almost everything there is to tell. My folks live in a small town near Hartford. I'm down here alone trying to make a living. Oh, I'm really just a nobody.
Oh, that was so lovely. Thank you.
You were a lady in distress, weren't you?
You were a lady in distress, weren't you?
What?
What?
Oh - uh - nothing.
You've been having quite an exciting time here, haven't you? All those meetings and business deals and society people - haven't you been having fun?
No. That is, I didn't Until I met you. I like talking to you, though Imagine my finding you right on my doorstep.
Look - there's Brookfield, the poet.
Really?
There's just one thing more. If it weren't for Miss Dawson being here with me, I'd probably bump your heads together.
Oh, I don't mind.
It's awfully nice of you to show me around like this.
I enjoy it.
I enjoy it.
The Aquarium was swell. If I lived in New York, I'd go there every day. I'll bet you do.
The Aquarium was swell. If I lived in New York, I'd go there every day. I'll bet you do.
Well, I'd like to - but I have a job to think of.
Sure. I met you.
Oh. What's happening about the opera?
Oh. What's happening about the opera?
Oh, that - well, we had another meeting. I told them I'd go on being Chairman if
I told 'em I'd play along with them if they lowered their prices - and cut down expenses - and broadcast.
What did they say?
What did they say?
Gosh, you look pretty tonight.
Gosh, you look pretty tonight.
What did they say?
What did they say?
Huh? Oh. They said I was crazy. Said I wanted to run it like a grocery store.
Huh? Oh. They said I was crazy. Said I wanted to run it like a grocery store.
What are they going to do?
What are they going to do?
Do you always wear your hair like that?
Have you seen the papers?
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
That's what I like about you. You think about a man's feelings. I'd like to go down to that newspaper and punch the fellow in the nose that's writing that stuff
Would you like to walk the rest of the way? It's so nice out.
Yes.
Yes.
Yeah, let's.
There you are. Grant's Tomb. I hope you're not disappointed.
It's wonderful.
It's wonderful.
To most people, it's an awful letdown.
To most people, it's an awful letdown.
Huh?

I say, to most people it's a washout.
I say, to most people it's a washout.
That depends on what they see.
That depends on what they see.
Now, what do you see?
Now, what do you see?
Me? Oh, I see a small Ohio farm boy becoming a great soldier. I see thousands of marching men. I see General Lee with a broken heart, surrendering, and I can see the beginning of a new nation, like Abraham Lincoln said. And I can see that Ohio boy being inaugurated as President Things like that can only happen in a country like America.
There's Times Square.
You can almost spit on it, can't you?
You can almost spit on it, can't you?
Why don't you try?
You're worried about those articles they're writing about you, aren't you?
I'm not worrying any more. I suppose they'll go on writing them till they get tired. You don't believe all that stuff, do you?
Oh, they just do it to sell the newspapers, you know.
Yeah, I guess so. What puzzles me is why people seem to get so much pleasure out of hurting each other. Why don't they try liking each other once in a while?
Here's a nice place.
Yeah. Anyway, there aren't any photographers around.
You know, you said something to me when you first met me that I've thought about a great deal.
What's that?
What's that?
You said I was a lady in distress.
You said I was a lady in distress.
Oh, that
Oh, that
What did you mean by that?
What did you mean by that?
Nothing
Oh, I don't know.
You must have met a lot of swell society girls since you've been here. Don't you like them?
You must have met a lot of swell society girls since you've been here. Don't you like them?
I haven't met anybody here that I like, particularly. They all seem to have the St. Vitus Dance.[12] Except you, of course. People here are funny. They work so hard at living - they forget how to live Last night, after I left you, I was walking along and looking at the tall buildings and I got to thinking about what Thoreau said. They
I'd rather have Mandrake Falls.
I'm from a small town too, you know.
I'm from a small town too, you know.
Really?
Really?
Probably as small as Mandrake Falls.
Probably as small as Mandrake Falls.
Gosh! What do you know about that!
I've often thought about going back.
You have?
You have?
Oh, yes. I used to have a lot of fun there when I was a little girl. I used to love to go fishing with my father. That's funny. He was a lot like you, my father was. Talked like you, too. Sometimes he'd let me hold the line while he smoked - and we'd just sit there for hours. And after awhile, for

He sounds like a person worth while knowing.
He played in the town band, too.
He did? I play the tuba
He did? I play the tuba
Yeah, I know.
Yeah, I know.
What did he play?
What did he play?
The drums. He taught me to play some.
The drums. He taught me to play some.
He did?
He did?
Yes. I can do "Swanee River." Would you like to hear me?
Yes. I can do "Swanee River." Would you like to hear me?
Sure!
Oh, I suppose you could do better.
Sure. I can sing "Humoresque."
Sure. I can sing "Humoresque."
"Humoresque"? I'll bet you don't even know how it goes.
"Humoresque"? I'll bet you don't even know how it goes.
Sure. Look! You sing it over again, and I'll do "Humoresque" with you.
Sure. Look! You sing it over again, and I'll do "Humoresque" with you.
It had better be good.
Couldn't sleep. Kinda wanted to talk to you. Do you mind?
No - not at all. I couldn't sleep either.
I wanted to thank you again for going out with me. Huh? Well, I don't know what I'd do without you. You've made up for all the fakes that I've met.
Well, that's very nice. Thank you.
Well, that's very nice. Thank you.
You know what I've been doing since I got home? Been working on a poem. It's about you. Sometimes it's kinda hard for me to say things - so I write 'em.
You know what I've been doing since I got home? Been working on a poem. It's about you. Sometimes it's kinda hard for me to say things - so I write 'em.
I'd like to read it some time.
I didn't think you could come with the party and everything.
Oh, I wouldn't let them stop me from seeing you. So I threw them out!
Oh, I wouldn't let them stop me from seeing you. So I threw them out!
You threw them out!
Yes, if it isn't too late.
I'll get my hat.
Ready?
Gosh, she looks better every time I see her.
Gosh, she looks better every time I see her.
Thank you.
The reason why I wanted to take a walk, Mary, is 'cause I wanted to talk to you.
Let's just walk, okay?
Let's just walk, okay?
All right.
Mary, I'm going home.
Are you? When?
Are you? When?
In a day or so, I think.
In a day or so, I think.
I don't blame you.
Do you mind if I talk to you, Mary? You don't have to pay any attention to me.
No, I don't mind.
No, I don't mind.
All my life, I've wanted somebody to talk to. Back in Mandrake Falls, I always used to talk to a girl.
All my life, I've wanted somebody to talk to. Back in Mandrake Falls, I always used to talk to a girl.
A girl?
A girl?
Oh, an imaginary one. I used to hike a lot through the woods and I'd always take this girl with me so I could talk to her. I'd show her my pet trees and things. Sounds kind of silly but we had a lot of fun doing it.
Well, here we are again.
Yes, here we are again. Good night.
Yes, here we are again. Good night.
Mary - I - excuse me
Would you like to read it? It's to you.
Yes, of course.
Hello, Mary?
Oh, hello darling.
What's the matter, hon?
Nothing.
What's up, Babe? Something's eating you.
No. It's nothing.
No. It's nothing.
My unfailing instinct tells me something's gone wrong with the stew.

Don't be ridiculous.
You haven't gotten very far, have you? That's where you were an hour ago. Come on, let's knock off and go down to Joe's. The gang's waiting for us.
I can't write it, Mabel! I don't know what's the matter with me.
Good night.
Mabel, that guy's either the dumbest, the stupidest, the most imbecilic idiot in the world - or he's the grandest thing alive. I can't make him out.
Mabel, that guy's either the dumbest, the stupidest, the most imbecilic idiot in the world - or he's the grandest thing alive. I can't make him out.

Search me. Ask the Gypsies.
Search me. Ask the Gypsies.
Here's a guy that's wholesome and fresh. To us he looks like a freak. You know what he told me tonight? He said when he gets married he wants to carry his bride over the threshold in his arms.

Is he? Yeah, I thought so, too. I tried to laugh, but I couldn't. It stuck in my throat.

He's got goodness, Mabel. Do you know what that is?
He's got goodness, Mabel. Do you know what that is?
Huh?
Huh?
No - of course you don't. We've forgotten. We're too busy being smart-alecks. Too busy in a crazy competition for nothing.
You're a fool, Babe.
I just couldn't stand seeing him again.
I just couldn't stand seeing him again.
Running away is no solution.
What'll I tell him if he calls up?
Tell him I had to leave suddenly. I got a job in China - some place.

You're acting like a school girl.
You're acting like a school girl.
What else can I do? Keeping this up is no good. He's bound to find out sometime. At least I can save him that .
Just a minute. No, you don't.
We're not going out tonight.
Why there she is! Of course she's home. Stupid of me . . .
Hello.
Look, I can do it!
What's gotten into you, Babe? I remember the time when you'd blast this town wide open before you'd let Cobb get away with a thing like this.

Leave four columns open on the front page tomorrow.
Now you're talking, Babe. I'll keep the whole front page open. What are you going to do?
Have lunch.
Cinderella Man! That's sensational, Babe! Sensational!
It took some high-powered acting, believe me.

Did it?

I was the world's sweetest ingenue.

Is he really that big a sap?
He's the original. There are no carbon copies of that one.
Cinderella Man! Babe, you stuck a tag on that hick that'll stick to him the rest of his life. Can you imagine Cobb's face when he reads this?

If we could sell tickets, we'd make a fortune.
How'd you get the picture?
Had the boys follow us.

Marvelous! "At two o'clock this morning, Mr. Deeds tied up traffic while he fed a bagful of doughnuts to a horse. When asked why he was doing it, he replied: 'I just wanted to see how many doughnuts this horse would eat before he'd ask for a cup of coffee.'" Beautiful! What happened after that?

I don't know. I had to duck to get the story out. He was so far along he never even missed me.

When're you going to see him again?
When're you going to see him again?
Tonight, maybe. I'll phone him at noon. Oh, my lunch hour. I'm a stenographer, you know. Mary Dawson.
You're a genius, Babe - a genius!
I even moved into Mabel Dawson's apartment - in case old snoopy Cobb might start looking around.

Good! Good! Stay there. Don't show your face down here. I'll tell everybody you're on your vacation. They'll never know where the stories are coming from. Stick close to him, Babe - you can get an exclusive story out of him every day for a month. We'll have the other papers crazy. Babe, I could kiss you!

Oh, no. No. Our deal was for a month's vacation - with pay.

Sure.
Sure.
With pay! She is out the door.

You'll get it, Babe. You'll get it.
What's bothering you, huh?
Last night he proposed to me.
Last night he proposed to me.
Proposed to you! You mean he asked you to marry him?

Why, Babe - that's terrific! "Cinderella Man Woos Mystery Girl! Who is the Mysterious Girl That"

Print one line of that, and I'll blow your place up!
Print one line of that, and I'll blow your place up!
Sorry, Babe. Sorry. It would have made a swell story. I just got carried away. That's too bad. So he proposed to you, huh? What a twist! You set out to nail him - and he
Sorry, Babe. Sorry. It would have made a swell story. I just got carried away. That's too bad. So he proposed to you, huh? What a twist! You set out to nail him - and he
Yeah. Funny twist, isn't it?
Yeah. Funny twist, isn't it?
Say, you haven't gone and fallen for that mug, have you?
What're you going to do?
I'm going to tell him the truth.
I'm going to tell him the truth.
Tell him you're Babe Bennett? Tell him you've been making a stooge out of him?

I'm having lunch with him today. He expects an answer. It's going to be pretty.
I'm having lunch with him today. He expects an answer. It's going to be pretty.
You're crazy! You can't do that!
He'll probably kick me right down the stairs. I only hope he does.
I'll put you on another job. You need never see him again, eh?
I'll put you on another job. You need never see him again, eh?
That's the rub.
That's the rub.
Oh, as bad as that, huh?
Oh, as bad as that, huh?
Telling him is the long shot - I'm going to take it.
This is for you , Mac. The names of all the headwaiters in town. You can always buy a bit of choice scandal from them at reasonable prices.
Aw, listen Babe, I can't let you quit now. You're not going through with this thing, are you?
It's for you. In a couple weeks you'll get the itch so bad, you'll be working for nothing.
Hello . . .
I suppose it's going to be the same old thing.
I tell you that dame's nuts.
I tell you that dame's nuts.
Right.
Come on, come on!
Hurry up!
It don't look as though we're gonna get any pictures tonight.
Babe ought to get him drunk again.
I wonder if they'd want to make it a quartet.
Shhh!
Yeah. Mac threw Cobb out again.
Boy, was he burning.
Boy, was he burning.
Just one little drink - and then we're ready to shoot.
Ow! My foot's asleep!
Come on - let's go!
We've got nothing to worry about. He's as naive as a child.
John
John
Close that door. Will you get Mrs. Cedar on the phone, please?
I know, Budington. We can't afford to have the books investigated right now. You must have said that a thousand times already.
But what if they fall into somebody else's hands, why - uh
But what if they fall into somebody else's hands, why - uh
Well, it hasn't happened yet - has it?

But a half million dollars! My goodness, where are we going to get
But a half million dollars! My goodness, where are we going to get
Will you stop worrying! It was I who got old man Semple to turn everything over to us, wasn't it? And who got the Power of Attorney from him ! All right, and I'll get it again! I'll take it easy. Those books'll never leave this office.
don't want to be critical, John, but here it is
Yes, I know. A week's gone by and we haven't got the Power of Attorney yet!
Yes, I know. A week's gone by and we haven't got the Power of Attorney yet!
Yes, but you said
Yes, but you said
I don't care what I said. I can't strangle him, can I!
The gentlemen from the opera are still waiting in the board room, sir. They're getting a trifle impatient, sir.
They are? I forgot all about them. What do you think they want?
Will you show Mr. Hallor to the front door?
Yes, sir.
Cobb's right. I mustn't talk to anybody.
Miss Dawson on the phone, sir.
Miss Dawson on the phone, sir.
Who? Miss Dawson?
Who? Miss Dawson?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Fine. I'll talk to her. Give me the phone, quick. She's the only one I'm going to talk to from now on.
You try it.
Me, sir?
How's it going? Okay?
Yes, quite all right. Thank you, sir.
Yes, quite all right. Thank you, sir.

How is this, sir?
Perfect! Perfect!

I wish you luck, sir.

We'll send for the police!

Let me go!
Thank heaven.
Better wire him right away, John.
Better wire him right away, John.
I'll do no such thing. I'm going there myself. You're going with me too, Anderson - and you too, Cobb.
Come on, John. What happened?
The smartest thing I ever did was to make that trip.
Relatives of old man Semple.
They keep insisting they should have some nuisance value.

Nuisance value?

They say if it hadn't been for Deeds, they'd have gotten all the money.
They say if it hadn't been for Deeds, they'd have gotten all the money.
Nuisance value. Maybe they have! Maybe they have! Maybe they have! Mr. and Mrs. Semple, please. How do you do?
Miss Bennett please!
This is outrageous!
The Falkner sisters are rather timid, Your Honor, and wish to be together. If the court pleases, I will only have one of them testify.
Yes! Yes! Let's get on with it.
Must we have the echo?
Suppose you just answer, Miss Jane. Now, will you tell the Court what everybody at home thinks of Longfellow Deeds?
He's what?
What was that you said he was?
Your Honor, I object.
Proceed.
It's a lie!
Mr. Cedar!
Mr. Cedar!
Mr. Deeds is drawing on his warped imagination!
You will please permit Mr. Deeds to finish.
But your honor
But your honor
Mr. Cedar!
Newspaperman?
Wants to know who the heir is.

Hang up.

Sorry, Mac, I can't. Yeah, Mac. Sure, but I ain't the attorney
Sorry, Mac, I can't. Yeah, Mac. Sure, but I ain't the attorney
Hang up.
Mr. Cedar is, and I haven't seen him in two days. Listen, Cedar, we've got to do something about the newspapers.
I'm not interested in the newspapers.

But it's a great story. Somewhere in this country a guy is walking into twenty million bucks.
But it's a great story. Somewhere in this country a guy is walking into twenty million bucks.
Yes, I know. My first concern is to locate the lucky man. When I do, it's your job to keep the newspapers away from him.
Yes, I know. My first concern is to locate the lucky man. When I do, it's your job to keep the newspapers away from him.
It's okay with me as long as my weekly stipend keeps coming in.
That's pretty.
Are you sure this is the town he lives in?
I guess we'd better try somebody else.
No, we won't! The next time that jumping jack comes out, I'll straddle him while you ask him your questions.
Yeah. A glorified doormat.
Yes. You see, rich people need someone to keep the crowds away. The world's full of pests. Then there's the newspapers to handle. One must know when to seek publicity - and when to avoid it.
I can understand that. We'll take a walk around town, meet you at the train at four o'clock. Congratulations, Mr. Deeds. You're one of the richest men in the country. We'll see you later. Goodbye and thank you.
See you later, kid.
I can't find him.
You can't?
You can't?
I looked everywhere. I even went to his house. It's locked up.
Look!
What?
What?
That tuba player!
Well, your uncle was Chairman of the Board of Directors. They probably expect you to carry on.
I'll tell those mugs to keep their shirts on, that you'll be right down.
Yes?
Make three reservations on the first train out to Mandrake Falls, Vermont.

Charlie, we're off! Papers all set?
All set.

Okay, then. Go to it. And, Charlie

Yeah?

Find out who wrote those newspaper articles and subpoena them right away.

Okay.
Mr. Longfellow Deeds?
Yes.
Yes.
How do you do.
How do you do.
How do you do.
How do you do.
I'm John Cedar - of the New York firm of Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington.
I'd like to ask you a few questions.
All right.
Mr. Deeds, are you the son of Dr. Joseph and Mary Deeds?
Yes.
Yes.
Are your parents living?
Are your parents living?
Why, no.
Why, no.
Mr. Deeds, does the name of Martin W. Semple mean anything to you?
Mr. Deeds, does the name of Martin W. Semple mean anything to you?
Not much. He's an uncle of mine, I think. I never saw him, but my mother's name was Semple, you know.
Not much. He's an uncle of mine, I think. I never saw him, but my mother's name was Semple, you know.
Well, he passed on. He was killed in a motor accident in Italy.
Well, he passed on. He was killed in a motor accident in Italy.
He was? Gee, that's too bad. If there's anything I can do to
Perhaps you didn't hear what I said, Mr. Deeds! The whole Semple fortune goes to you! $20,000,000!
Oh, yes, I heard you all right. $20,000,000. That's quite a lot, isn't it?
Mr. Cobb here is an ex-newspaperman associated with your uncle for many years - as a sort of buffer.
Buffer?
Are you a married man, Mr. Deeds?
Who - me? No.
Saving a lady in distress, eh? Well, I suppose we all have dreams like that when we are young. Incidentally, we'd better get started. You'll have to pack.
What for?
What for?
You're going to New York with us.
You're going to New York with us.
When?
Will you have a cigar?
No, thank you.
I wouldn't worry if I were you. Of course, a large fortune like this entails a great responsibility - but you'll have a good deal of help. So don't worry. Leave everything to me.
Oh, I wasn't worried about that.
Oh, I wasn't worried about that.
No?
No?
I was wondering where they're going to get another tuba player for the band.
It's merely a suggestion. I don't wish to press the point, Mr. Deeds, but if you'll give me your Power of Attorney we'll take care of everything. It'll save you a lot of petty annoyances. Every shark in town will be trying to sell you something.
Oh, yes, there've been a lot of them around here already. Strangest kind of people. Salesmen - politicians - moochers - all want something. I haven't had a minute to myself. Haven't seen Grant's Tomb yet.
Oh, yes, there've been a lot of them around here already. Strangest kind of people. Salesmen - politicians - moochers - all want something. I haven't had a minute to myself. Haven't seen Grant's Tomb yet.
Well, you see, your uncle didn't bother with that sort of thing. He left everything to us. He traveled most of the time, and enjoyed himself. You should do the same thing, Mr. Deeds.

Besides wanting to be my lawyer, you also want to handle my investments too?
Besides wanting to be my lawyer, you also want to handle my investments too?
Yes. That is to say
Yes. That is to say
Well, outside of your regular fee, how much extra will it cost?
Well, outside of your regular fee, how much extra will it cost?
Oh - nothing. No extra charge.
Oh - nothing. No extra charge.
That involves a lot of extra work, doesn't it?
That involves a lot of extra work, doesn't it?
Yes, but that's an added service a firm like Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington usually donates.
Yes, but that's an added service a firm like Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington usually donates.
Budington. Funny, I can't think of a rhyme for Budington yet.
I think you ought to give this matter some thought, Mr. Deeds.
Huh?
Huh?
I mean, about the Power of Attorney.
I mean, about the Power of Attorney.
Oh, yes. Yes, I will.
Why not? Who is he?
A lawyer representing some woman with a claim against the estate. Tell him to see me at my office.
A lawyer representing some woman with a claim against the estate. Tell him to see me at my office.
Well, if he has a claim, we'd better see him. Send him in.
He's capable of causing you a lot of trouble, Mr. Deeds.
How can he make any trouble for me? I haven't done anything.
I can't hold out any longer either, Mr. Deeds. Being an attorney for you will be a very simple affair.
You're not my attorney yet, Mr. Cedar. Not till I find out what's on your mind. Suppose you get the books straightened out quick so I can have a look at them.
You're not my attorney yet, Mr. Cedar. Not till I find out what's on your mind. Suppose you get the books straightened out quick so I can have a look at them.
Yes, of course, if you wish. But you must be prepared. This sort of thing will be daily routine. If it becomes annoying, you let me know. Goodbye, Mr. Deeds. Goodbye, sir.
Oh, will you come in please, gentlemen?
Is Mr. Deeds in?
Is Mr. Deeds in?
No - he's over to the park arranging for the bazaar, so's to raise money for the fire engine. Mal, you shoulda knowed he was in the park.
Come in, please. Come in. Can I get you a cup of tea?
No, thanks.
No, thanks.
Sit down. Sure I couldn't get you a glass of lemonade or something?
Sit down. Sure I couldn't get you a glass of lemonade or something?
That's very kind of you. Are you related to him?
That's very kind of you. Are you related to him?
No, I'm his housekeeper.
No, I'm his housekeeper.
Well, we'd like to find out something about him. What does he do for a living?
Well, we'd like to find out something about him. What does he do for a living?
He and Jim Mason own the Tallow Works. But that's not where he makes his money. He makes most of it from his poetry.
Oh, it'll do in a pinch.
Yes, indeed. I wonder why he left me all that money? I don't need it.
Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington. Funny, I can't think of a rhyme for Budington.
Why should you?
Why should you?
Well, whenever I run across a funny name, I always like to poke around for a rhyme. Don't you?
Well, whenever I run across a funny name, I always like to poke around for a rhyme. Don't you?
Nah.
Nah.
I've got one for Cobb
I've got one for Cobb
"There once was a man named Cobb, Who kept Semple away from the mob. Came the turn of the tide And Semple - he died - And now poor Cobb's out of a job!"
"There once was a man named Cobb, Who kept Semple away from the mob. Came the turn of the tide And Semple - he died - And now poor Cobb's out of a job!"
Sounds like a two weeks' notice to me.

I've gotten the 'sackaroo' in many ways - but never in rhyme.
I've gotten the 'sackaroo' in many ways - but never in rhyme.
Oh, I don't mean that. I'm sure I'm going to need your help.
Oh, I don't mean that. I'm sure I'm going to need your help.
Oh, that's different if it's just poetry.
This afternoon - at four o'clock.
I don't think we've got any suitcases.
Have a drink?
No, thanks.
Thanks Oh, did you send that telegram to Jim Mason?
Jim Mason? Oh, yeah. Yeah. No, I didn't send it. I've got it written out, though. Here it is. "Arthur's been with the Tallow Works too long. STOP. Don't think we should fire him. Longfellow."
Jim Mason? Oh, yeah. Yeah. No, I didn't send it. I've got it written out, though. Here it is. "Arthur's been with the Tallow Works too long. STOP. Don't think we should fire him. Longfellow."
Fine. Send it right away. I don't want him to fire Arthur.
Fine. Send it right away. I don't want him to fire Arthur.
Oh, sure. Sure. We don't want to fire Arthur.
Oh, sure. Sure. We don't want to fire Arthur.
He was the last baby my father delivered, Arthur was.
You'd better get right down there. That opera mob is about to break into the Mad Song from "Lucia."[2]
Oh, I don't want to keep them waiting any longer. They're important people. I wish you'd go along with me, Cobb. They're all strangers to me.
Gee, I'm busy. Did the opera people always come here for their meetings?
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
That's funny. Why is that?
That's funny. Why is that?
Why do mice go where there's cheese?[3]
I can't hold out on you any longer. Lamb bites wolf. Beautiful.
Only common sense.
Well, how about tonight? What would you like in the way of entertainment?
Entertainment?
Entertainment?
Your uncle had a weakness for dark ones, tall and stately. How would you like yours? Dark or fair, tall or short, fat or thin, tough or tender?

Some other time, Cobb. Some other time.

Okay, you're the boss. When your blood begins to boil, yell out. I'll be seeing you!
Did you see all this stuff in the papers?
Arthur wants to quit!
Arthur wants to quit!
Arthur! Who's Arthur?
Arthur! Who's Arthur?
He's the shipping clerk at the Tallow Works. Wants a $2 raise - or he'll quit.
He's the shipping clerk at the Tallow Works. Wants a $2 raise - or he'll quit.
What do I care about Arthur! Did you see this stuff in the paper? How'd it get in there? What'd you do last night? Who were you talking to?
And what'd you do to those bodyguards? They quit this morning. Said you locked them up.
Oh, they insisted on following me.

What do you think bodyguards are for?

But what about this "Cinderella Man"?
But what about this "Cinderella Man"?
That's my job. I'll take care of that. I'll keep that stuff out of the papers - if you'll help me. But I can't do anything if you go around talking to people. Will you promise me to be careful from now on?

Yes, I guess I'll have to.
Thank you. If you feel the building rock, it'll be me blasting into this editor.
Just as I suspected, wise guy! I don't mind you making a sap out of yourself - but you made one out of me, too.
Will you tell the gentleman I'm not in?
Will you tell the gentleman I'm not in?
Mary Dawson, huh? Mary Dawson, my eye. That dame took you for a sleigh ride that New York will laugh about for years. She's the slickest, two- timing, double-crossing
She's the star reporter on The Mail. Every time you opened your kisser, you gave her another story. She's the dame who slapped that monicker on you - "Cinderella Man." You've been making love to a double dose of cyanide!
Shut up!
You shouldn't be running away like this. What's going to happen to the Estate?
They can have the Estate.
What about your knocking off for lunch?
Not hungry. I want to get through this work in a hurry, and then I want to go home. What price did you get on those trucks?
Not hungry. I want to get through this work in a hurry, and then I want to go home. What price did you get on those trucks?
Come on, come on. What are you trying to do, kid? Keel over? You haven't been out of this house in two weeks.
Come on, come on. What are you trying to do, kid? Keel over? You haven't been out of this house in two weeks.
Well, maybe I will have a sandwich. Do you mind waiting a few minutes?
Cobb! Get lunch for the rest of them.
What? There must be 2000 of them out there.
What? There must be 2000 of them out there.
Well, that doesn't make 'em any less hungry.
Well, that doesn't make 'em any less hungry.
Okay, Santa Claus. 2000 lunches.
I'm Chairman?
Oh Yes, of course - you've just been elected.
Oh Yes, of course - you've just been elected.

Wait a minute. What does the Chairman do?
Why, the Chairman presides at the meetings.

That's what I thought. If you don't mind, I'm rather interested in the Treasurer's report. I'd like to hear it.
You see, Mr. Deeds, the opera is not conducted for profit.
It isn't? What is it conducted for?
It isn't? What is it conducted for?
Why, it's an artistic institution
Why, it's an artistic institution
We own an opera house, don't we?
We provide opera.
But you charge. I mean, you sell tickets?
That's impossible. The opera has never paid.
Well, then, we must give the wrong kind of shows.
The wrong kind! There isn't any wrong or right kind. Opera is opera!
I guess it is. But I personally wouldn't care to be head of a business that kept losing money. That wouldn't be common sense. Incidentally, where is the $180,000 coming from?
I guess it is. But I personally wouldn't care to be head of a business that kept losing money. That wouldn't be common sense. Incidentally, where is the $180,000 coming from?

Well, we were rather expecting it to come from you.
Me?!
Me?!
Naturally.

Excuse me, gentlemen, there's nothing natural about that .
Now, where were we?
You see, Mr. Deeds, the opera is not conducted like any ordinary business.

Why not?

Because it just isn't a business, that's all!

Well, maybe it isn't to you, but it certainly is a business to me, if I have to make up a loss of $180,000. If it's losing that much money, there must be something wrong. Maybe you charge too much. Maybe you're selling bad merchandise. Maybe lots of things. I don't know. You see, I expect to do a lot of good with that
You remember, Dr. Fosdick, in my last book there are some very fine examples.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Especially, the one of the young nobleman, you remember?
Especially, the one of the young nobleman, you remember?
Oh, yes. Yes, of course Dr. Von Holler. Very interesting.
Oh, yes. Yes, of course Dr. Von Holler. Very interesting.
It reminds me very much of this one. Nicht wahr?
It reminds me very much of this one. Nicht wahr?
Ja.
Ja.
It takes so long to detect them because their mood changes so often and so quickly. Now, Your Honor, may I show you? May I use the chart?
Let him alone.
Let me alone! If you know what's good for you - you'll let me get this off my chest! How did you feel feeding doughnuts to a horse? Get a kick out of it, huh? Got a big laugh? Did you ever think of feeding doughnuts to human beings! No!
Yeah - that's all that's worrying you. What do I want? A chance to feed a wife and kids! I'm a farmer. A job! That's what I want!
A farmer, eh! You're a moocher, that's what you are! I wouldn't believe you or anybody else on a stack of bibles! You're a moocher like all the rest of them around here, so get out of here!
A farmer, eh! You're a moocher, that's what you are! I wouldn't believe you or anybody else on a stack of bibles! You're a moocher like all the rest of them around here, so get out of here!
Sure - everybody's a moocher to you. A mongrel dog eating out of a garbage pail is a moocher to you!
Here's the order for the plows. We got a good price on them.
That's fine. Thanks. I'll look 'em over later.
That's fine. Thanks. I'll look 'em over later.
Oh, Mr. Deeds
my wife wanted me to tell you she she prays for you every night.
Well, thanks, I - uh How do you do? What is your name?
Mrs. Semple?
Yes. Your uncle's common-law wife. She has a legal claim on the estate.
I leave it to you, Mr. Deeds. Can you conceive of any court not being in sympathy with any woman who gave up the best years of her life for an old man like your uncle?
What kind of wife did you say she was?
What kind of wife did you say she was?
Common-law wife. On top of that, there's a child.
Common-law wife. On top of that, there's a child.
A child? My uncle's?
A child? My uncle's?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
That's awful. The poor woman should be taken care of immediately.
That's awful. The poor woman should be taken care of immediately.
I'm glad to see you're willing to be reasonable, Mr. Deeds.
I'm glad to see you're willing to be reasonable, Mr. Deeds.
If she was his wife, she should have all the money. That's only fair. I don't want a penny of it.
Well, what about it, Mr. Deeds?
You'll excuse me, won't you? I'll be right back.
Sorry to keep you waiting so long. Those opera people are funny. They wanted me to put up $180,000.
What about it, Mr. Deeds?
What about it, Mr. Deeds?
Why, I turned them down, naturally.
Why, I turned them down, naturally.
No, I mean - about my client.
No, I mean - about my client.
Oh - we'll have to do something about the common wife.
Of course, we don't want to appear greedy, Mr. Deeds.
Huh?
Huh?
I say we don't want to appear greedy.
I say we don't want to appear greedy.
Oh. That.
Mrs. Semple is entitled by law to one-third of the estate.
And don't ever get down on your knees again, understand?
Mrs. Semple is entitled to one- third of the estate.
One-third? That's about $7,000,000 isn't it?
One-third? That's about $7,000,000 isn't it?
Well, we didn't expect that much. I'm sure I can get her to settle quietly for one million.
You're making a mistake, Mr. Deeds.
Oh no, I'm not. I don't like your face. Besides, there's something fishy about a person who would settle for a million dollars when they can get seven million. I'm surprised that Mr. Cedar, who's supposed to be a smart man, couldn't see through that.

Now wait a minute, buddy
There's one nice thing about being rich - you ring a bell and things happen. When the servant comes in, Mr. Hallor, I'm going to ask him to show you to the door. Many people don't know where it is.
No use in getting tough. That'll get you nowhere, Mr. Deeds. You know, we've got letters.
No - I don't want it, thank you.
Why, you must drink! All poets drink!
Well, I don't know. I
Mr. Morrow, over there, for instance, just dashes them off.
Yes. Have you any peculiar characteristics when you are creating?
Well, I play the tuba.
No.
You mean to tell me you don't carry a pocketful around with you?
Look, he's temperamental.
Yeah, what if I am? What about it?
Your Honor
Yes?
Yes?
I'd like to get in my two cents' worth.
I'd like to get in my two cents' worth.
Take the stand!
Proceed.
Well, I don't know where to begin. There's been so many things said about me that I
A what?
An O-filler. You fill in all the spaces in the O's, with your pencil. I was watching you.
Mr. Deeds, do you recall forcibly ejecting people from your home?
Oh, yes. Yes. About my throwing those people out of my house. Mrs. Pomponi told the truth. I did throw them out because I didn't want the party in the first place. I didn't invite anybody. Mrs. Pomponi did all that. They just came to see what kind of a freak the "Cinderella Man" was. I don't know how people like that are supposed
Now about the Falkner sisters. That's kind of funny. I mean about Mr. Cedar going all the way to Mandrake Falls to bring them here. Do you mind if I talk to them?
Not at all.
Mr. Deeds, you haven't yet touched upon a most important thing. This rather fantastic idea of yours to want to give away your entire fortune. It is, to say the least, most uncommon.
Oh yes, I was getting to that, Your Honor.
Please, Mr. Cedar! Proceed.
Personally, I don't know what Mr. Cedar's raving about. From what I can see, no matter what system of government we have, there will always be leaders and always be followers.
Anything else, Mr. Deeds?
No. Yes. There's just one more thing I'd like to get off my chest before I finish.
No. Yes. There's just one more thing I'd like to get off my chest before I finish.
Proceed.
Proceed.
Thank you, Your Honor.
Huh? On, no. Nobody important.
Be sure and point 'em out to me, won't you?
Be sure and point 'em out to me, won't you?
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
I'm a writer myself, you know.
Uh-huh.
I write poetry.
I write poetry.
Uh-huh.
Brookfield just came in.
Oh, the poet? Where?
Oh, the poet? Where?
Over at that big round table. The one that looks like a poodle.
Say fellow, you neglected me - and I feel very put out. Look, sock it right there, will you? Lay one right on the button,[6] but sock it hard.
That's all right. I got it off my chest.
That's all right. I got it off my chest.
The difference between them and me is I know when I've been a skunk. You take me to the nearest news- stand and I'll eat a pack of your postcards raw. Raw!
Oh, what a magnificent deflation of smugness. Pal, you've added ten years to my life! A poet with a straight left and a right hook - delicious! Delicious! You're my guest from now on - forever and a day - even unto eternity!
Thanks, but Miss Dawson and I are going out to see the sights.
Thanks, but Miss Dawson and I are going out to see the sights.
Fine, fine. Swell, You just showed me a sight lovely to behold, and I'd like to reciprocate. Listen, you hop aboard my magic carpet thanks - and I'll show you sights that you've never seen before.
Fine, fine. Swell, You just showed me a sight lovely to behold, and I'd like to reciprocate. Listen, you hop aboard my magic carpet thanks - and I'll show you sights that you've never seen before.
I'd kind of like to see Grant's Tomb - and the Statue of Liberty.
Well, you'll not only see those, but before the evening's half through, you'll be leaning against the Leaning Tower of Pisa - you'll mount Mt. Everest. I'll show you the Pyramids and all the little Pyramiddes, leaping from sphinx to sphinx. Pal, how would you like to go on a real, old-fashioned binge?
Binge?
Binge?
Yes. I mean the real McCoy. Listen, you play saloon with me, and I'll introduce you to every wit, every nit-wit, and every half-wit in New York. We'll go on a twister that'll make Omar the soused philosopher of Persia[7] look like an anemic on a goat's milk diet.
That ought to be fun.
Fun? Say, listen, I'll take you on a bender that will live in your memory as a thing of beauty and joy forever. Boy! Boy! My headpiece!
Who are they?
I don't know.
New mouthpiece. Been waiting two weeks for this. Kids keep swiping them all the time. They use 'em for bean shooters. What can I do for you gentlemen?
You gentlemen going to stay for lunch?
How about lunch? Are the gentlemen going to stay - or not?
Of course they're going to stay. She's got some fresh orange layer cake. You know, with the thick stuff on the top? Sure, they don't want to go to the hotel.
No, he's too fussy for that. That's what's the matter with him. There are lots of nice girls right here in Mandrake Falls who're dying to be married
Don't pay any attention to her.
Don't pay any attention to her.
He's got a lot of foolish notions - about saving a lady in distress.
He's got a lot of foolish notions - about saving a lady in distress.
Now you keep out of this!
Well, we could borrow a couple from Mrs. Simpson. You know, she went to Niagara Falls last year.
I'm kind of nervous. I've never been away from Mandrake Falls in my life. Kind of like to see Grant's Tomb, though.
Hear what he said? You know how much twenty million is?
I don't care how much it is. You sit right there and eat your lunch. You haven't touched a thing.
What is your name?

Is she home?

Yeah. What?
Yeah. What?
Is Mary home?
You mean by the neck or something?
Sure. They got on my nerves, so I threw 'em out.
Nice day out - er, nice night - wasn't it? - isn't it?
Yes, lovely. We've had a lot of nice weather lately.
Yes, lovely. We've had a lot of nice weather lately.
It would be a nice night to go for a walk, don't you think?
It would be a nice night to go for a walk, don't you think?
Oh yes, I think it'd be a swell night to go for a walk. A nice long one.
Goodnight. Don't worry. I won't keep her out late.
Thank you so much. Good night.
Tails tonight, sir?
What - tails? Why, that's a monkey suit![5] Do you want people to laugh at me? I never wore one of those things in my life.

That was something I was never able to find out, sir.
Mr. Deeds - Mr. Deeds, sir - you really must get up. It's late!
You're Walter, aren't you?

Yes, sir.

I just wanted to make sure.
Yes, sir.

Miss Dawson, sir? No, sir. No Miss Dawson has called, sir.

I'd better call her up and apologize. I don't remember taking her home last night.
I'd better call her up and apologize. I don't remember taking her home last night.
I'd venture to say, sir, you don't remember much of anything that happened last night, sir.
What do you mean? I remember everything! Hand me my pants - I wrote her phone number on a piece of paper.
You have no pants, sir.
You came home last night - without them.
I did what!
I did what!
As a matter of fact, you came home without any clothes. You were in your - uh - shorts. Yes, sir.

The ones who brought you home, sir. They said you and another gentleman kept walking up and down the streets, shouting: "Back to nature! Clothes are a blight on civilization! Back to nature!"
Please!
But how'll I put on the slipper, sir?
Yes, sir. I beg pardon, sir, but did you ever find what you were looking for, sir?
Looking for?
Looking for?
You kept searching me last night, sir. Going through my pockets. You said you were looking for a rhyme for Budington.

Get out. The evil finger's on you. Get out!

What, sir?
Why, that's an echo, sir!
You try it.

Me, sir?

Yeah.
Yes, sir. What is it, sir? Anything happened3

Yes, sir. Very good, sir. Here it is right here, sir. There, sir.
Pack my things, Walter. I'm going home.
Yes, sir.
Shall I call the police, sir?
No! What do you want!!
What do they want from me? What have I done that's so wrong? They act as though they don't have their own peculiar things... They do! Believe me. Everybody's got something... Even you probably have things.
Me more than most.
Me more than most.
Why are they ganging up against me?

I'm not sure. But I think they're worried about you.

It's the kids, you know, not Jeremy. He had nothing to do with this -- except pay, of course. He's always willing to pay. He's extremely generous. I'm so humiliated that my own children would threaten me.

They said if I didn't get help, they wouldn't deal with me any more. What do you think about that?

Good kids.
Mmmmfffstttubll abbittmm.
Hmm?
I said... you must come out to the house for dinner on Thursday.
Really? You think so?
Really? You think so?
Yes. Jeremy will be home for the weekend. And you can meet the kids.

Uh-huh. What are they?
Oh, all the great writers -- Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, Moby Dick... those people. Each is bound in genuine premium leather with 22 carat gold accents. It's a magnificent set -- and only $33.50 per volume. Right away you get Great Expectations for just $6.99.

We argued on Sunday. He went to work on Monday and stayed in the city during the week, like always. But on Thursday, when he normally comes home, he didn't. Didn't call either. Not till Saturday afternoon.
You must have been concerned.
You must have been concerned.
It's happened before. I'm shocked by how little I'm feeling. I can't understand it. I'll probably have a complete depressoid collapse soon, won't I?

Doubtful. What did he say?
Doubtful. What did he say?
He said he wasn't coming back. He said it wasn't working for him any more. That it hadn't "worked for him" for quite a while... You know what I regret the most? I'm sorry I let him make the kids take his name. He was an acquirer. He liked to acquire things.
I know my time's up, but I've got to get this out while I've got hold of it --
Take your time.
Take your time.
-- When I was in high school, the thing I wanted most, when I was stuck in class, the thing I was always desperately in pursuit of -- was a hall pass. That's all I wanted. I loved moving freely around the school while everybody else was trapped in there... And that's how I feel right now... Like I have some giant, all- day

It's my daughter Sofie... she's gotta problem.
It's my daughter Sofie... she's gotta problem.
What's that?

We're not sure. She's been to all kinds of doctors in the city and they've said different things. Some of 'em are callin' it -- -- Epstein-Barr virus, and the rest are callin' it... Chronic Fatigue Symptom...

No... a little. There's a lot of debate about it.
No... a little. There's a lot of debate about it.
Yeah, I got that. Some people think it's all in their heads. It's been so bad she's had to move back here to Mumford and live with us. And I'm not sure that's the best thing, either...
Yeah, I got that. Some people think it's all in their heads. It's been so bad she's had to move back here to Mumford and live with us. And I'm not sure that's the best thing, either...
Why's that?
Why's that?
Oh... a lot of things. Several different factors. Will you see her, Doctor Mumford?
Oh... a lot of things. Several different factors. Will you see her, Doctor Mumford?
Sure. Why don't you bring her up to my office at 3 tomorrow afternoon.
I'm not sure she'll come. She's in a mood. Do you ever go to somebody's house?
Generally that doesn't work out so well. It sends the wrong message to people who need to make a change.
Hello, Mr. Cook. I was wondering if Sofie was around?
Were you supposed to have a session?
Were you supposed to have a session?
No. It's sort of spur of the moment.
Her friend from the city came and took her out to dinner. First time in a long time she's been willing.
A friend?
Better make yourself comfortable. We got a three hour drive here.
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
You're the shrink, aren't you?

Ernest, what do you think?
Ernest, what do you think?
I think he's got a point.
Thank you.
You never got back to me. ...I called to say we'd like to take you out for a meal?... Kind of a professional welcome.
What Ernest means, I think, is we're very interested in other methodology... different kinds of training. We're great believers in learning from each other. I've learned so much from Ern -- Dr. Delbanco...
...And I from Phyllis.
...And I from Phyllis.
So... the University of Kentucky. Who runs the program down there?
But they're certainly dead. And yes, personally, I find it a bit odd.
It could happen. What about his state certification exams? The records seem to be in order.
You do seem much more disposed toward him than I understand, Ernest. Did I miss something?
Oh, for god's sake, Phyllis -- we have no reason to doubt the man! Are we listening to Lionel now?
Phyllis, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to shout...
No, Dr. Delbanco, it is I who am sorry. Sorry to have wasted your time with such...
Dr. Delbanco. It's nice to see you again.
I don't think you know Dr. Sheeler. She's the other therapist here in town.
I don't think you know Dr. Sheeler. She's the other therapist here in town.
Of course... I've heard great things about you.
What are you doing for lunch?
Right now?
I've run on. Forgive me. We're here to talk about you.
Are we?
My mentor was an amazing teacher named Benton Mandlebaum. Died quite tragically in the collapse of a gazebo.
I think I've heard of him... a disciple of Rothberg, wasn't he?
Interesting approach. What was his name?
Dorothy Fowler. Fantastic woman. She passed last year in a train wreck. Damned Amtrak.
We're interested in any new therapies. How would you characterize your approach?
My approach?
...I won't go into that today. Though, if we should continue these sessions, as I certainly hope we will, there are some aspects of that I would like to look at. God knows, I've listened to enough people giving me the juicy -- ...At any rate, I just wanted to acknowledge the catalyzing effect your comment had on me. I just hope that it
How do you mean?
Well... you see, when I broke it off with Phyllis, she was naturally upset and she became more determined than ever to pursue certain -- how to put it -- doubts she's been harboring...
What kind of doubts?
What kind of doubts?
About you... your background and your qualifications. I'm afraid Phyllis somehow got you mixed up in her fury with me, and actually took the whole issue to the state board.
I see.
And please, for whatever small way I may have encouraged this, accept my apologies. There is good news, though.

Phyllis has decided to leave town and pursue her practice in the city. Which leaves you the only psychologist in town.

Where's your wife, Henry?
Go to hell.
Go to hell.
I didn't hear you.
We got divorced. I had to get rid of her. She couldn't satisfy me.
What?!
I was... never satisfied.
Now we're back on track.
What's that?
You are so mean.
What is it?
It's a thought I had.
It's a thought I had.
Should I open it now?
Let me just say something here... I have no idea if this is going to help.
What exactly is it supposed to do?

You remember when I asked you about pornography --
You remember when I asked you about pornography --
-- I find it degrading. Maximum gynecology and minimum turn-on --
-- I find it degrading. Maximum gynecology and minimum turn-on --
-- and you told me that. Still, there's some kind of imagery that's haunting you and, I think, getting in your way --
-- and you told me that. Still, there's some kind of imagery that's haunting you and, I think, getting in your way --
-- Which I don't necessarily agree.
-- Which I don't necessarily agree.
But you did come to me.
My guess is these images were burned into your brain when you were young. Maybe if we could nail down the exact fantasies that are haunting you -- maybe you could get past them... Anyway, I thought we could try an experiment.
And the experiment is in here?
Whoa, whoa, what are you doing? I want to know what's in here.
There's absolutely no reason to think this is going to have any impact on you. I'm embarrassed to have --
Uh, sorry, I'm going to have to... ...I really appreciate what you're trying to... uh, I can't thank you enough for...
My pleasure.
I feel like we're making real progress here.
Me too, Doc. And I can't tell you what that package meant to me --
I didn't see you there. Can I help you?
My name's Gilroy. I'm from the State Certification Board.
It's all right, it won't bite you. Under civil code 1294.67b you are entitled to be notified that your status and certification are being reviewed. This is the notice.
Do you want to come in?
Do you want to come in?
No thanks. Plenty of time for that when we're a little further along.
No thanks. Plenty of time for that when we're a little further along.
Mr. Gilroy --
What brought this on?
I'm not at liberty to say. Sometimes it's just routine, sometimes there's been a complaint. We'll be in touch.
You must be Dr. Mumford of Mumford. Jeremy Brockett.
Doc. Nice to meet you.
Doc. Nice to meet you.
Sorry I'm late... traffic was a motherfucker. Have another drink, I'll be back in five.
I think you'll like this. Know much about Cuban cigars?
Nope.
Are you a man who likes to treat himself right?
I've had my moments.
I've had my moments.
I am. And I'm not ashamed of it. Nobody ever said on their death bed -- "I treated myself too well."
I am. And I'm not ashamed of it. Nobody ever said on their death bed -- "I treated myself too well."
I thought it was -- Nobody ever said, "I should have spent more time at the office."

Fill in the blank. I don't mind the office. The point is, you only go 'round once. Like the Zens say -- Be here now.

What do you do?

Althea hasn't told you?

We've been talking about her, mostly.

Well, in '85 four of us left our firms and formed an investment banking venture. We've got twenty-three people working there now.
Well, in '85 four of us left our firms and formed an investment banking venture. We've got twenty-three people working there now.
You've done well.
We've done... very well. You know anything about addiction, Doc?
A little.
A little.
Well, I'm addicted to winning. I say when you're in the red zone, you gotta score. So what do you think?
Well, I'm addicted to winning. I say when you're in the red zone, you gotta score. So what do you think?
Tastes good.
Tastes good.
No... I mean about Althea. About her... ...behavior. Do you think you can fix her up?
No... I mean about Althea. About her... ...behavior. Do you think you can fix her up?
What do you think's wrong with her?
What do you think's wrong with her?
She's gone weird is what's wrong with her. Out of control. Probably from living out here in Mayberry.
You're the doctor, what do you think?
She seems very unhappy.
Clarence Norman White, do you understand how serious are the crimes with which you have been charged?
I do.
I do.
Do you realize how insidious it is to invade the most private thoughts and secret lives of unsuspecting people?...
...People who have come to you with the faith that you know what you're doing... and that you are who you say you are?
Yes, your honor.
Yes, your honor.
It means absolutely nothing to me that so many of your patients have come forward with praise for you and your therapeutic skills. You understand that?
It means absolutely nothing to me that so many of your patients have come forward with praise for you and your therapeutic skills. You understand that?
Yes.
Mr. White, I am frustrated that the criminal code in this state allows a maximum sentence of only six months and a maximum fine of only $2000.
I'm sorry, your honor.
I'm sorry, your honor.
What?
What?
I'm sorry you're frustrated.
I'm sorry you're frustrated.
Are you disrespecting this court, Mr. White?
Are you disrespecting this court, Mr. White?
No, sir. I was empathizing. Sorry.
No, sir. I was empathizing. Sorry.
Maybe you can empathize with this -- Maximum fine. Three months in jail, three months house arrest. Sentence to begin immediately at the Orchard Valley Correctional Facility. Case closed. This court is adjourned.
Yeah... me you, too... I was at your house...
Oh?
Oh?
Upstairs, with Doc... Yeah, it's very nice... I heard your shower.
I've seen you going by on your board, but I didn't realize -- you're so young... to be so...
What?
So, is this like a Japanese restaurant?
I'd better get in there.
I'd better get in there.
That's a lot of people all at once.
That's a lot of people all at once.
It's okay. They pre-order. There's a choice of three entrees.
It's okay. They pre-order. There's a choice of three entrees.

Meat loaf, turkey quesadillas, or salad nicoise.
Salad nicoise? I love salad nicoise.
Salad nicoise? I love salad nicoise.
You do?

Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, come on in.
You're early... it's not ready. What happened?
My patient had to leave early.
My patient had to leave early.
Who was that?
Does the phrase "nosy" have any meaning to you, Lily?
I think it's like... inquisitive.
I think it's like... inquisitive.
It was Henry Follett.
It was Henry Follett.
Man, you see him a lot. And it's very wrong to reveal it. Next you'll be saying what his problem is.
Man, you see him a lot. And it's very wrong to reveal it. Next you'll be saying what his problem is.
What do you want to know?
What do you want to know?
You're terrible. I'm never telling you anything.
How long you been in this town?
Oh, I don't know...
Oh, I don't know...
Four months, two and a half weeks -- that's how long. And you've already got more patients than those other two shrinks combined.
Four months, two and a half weeks -- that's how long. And you've already got more patients than those other two shrinks combined.
Lily, I don't think even you could know that --
You know who that is, don't you? You really don't? That's Skip Skipperton, man. He gets himself hit by a truck, this whole town shuts down.
Oh, so that's him? The Panda Man.
So, what makes you so popular? What's your secret?
You like me. How come?
You like me. How come?
Not sure. Let me think about it.
How ya doin', Ainge? Evenin', Lily.
Doc. Ainge...
Do we run into the street? No, I didn't think so. Nice car. How's that place?
It's a pretty piece of land.
And the Brocketts?
Horror show. What'd you do tonight?
Horror show. What'd you do tonight?
It was insane here, man. 'Hadda call in the National Guard. Then I did my laundry... watched 20/20.

Shocking. Did you know the government is wasteful? You heard it here first. Oh, and being a supermodel... it's no walk in the park.
Shocking. Did you know the government is wasteful? You heard it here first. Oh, and being a supermodel... it's no walk in the park.
Why do you watch?
Why do you watch?
No gentleman caller, Doc. Not that I care. I've had it with men. They're so fascinated by their own crap. Took me four years to get the last one out. Almost turned me into a dyke... These days my idea of a hot date is a long shower by myself before bed. Now that feels good. And you don't have to do all that...
They come through a few times each year. Hello, Mrs. Saito, good to see you again! It's a tour.
Where am I supposed to eat?
Where am I supposed to eat?
You're on your own today, honey.
Lily, I want you to meet Skip. Skip, Lily.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
...so rich?
...so accomplished.
Doc...
Lily.
Lily.
Doc.
I don't want you to be mad at Skip...
He told you.
He told you.
Skip and I wouldn't have got together if it weren't for you. That's a big deal.
Skip and I wouldn't have got together if it weren't for you. That's a big deal.
You would have met in some shower eventually...

I want to give you something. Will you let me?

Thanks, Lily, I don't need anything.
Thanks, Lily, I don't need anything.
Yes, you do, you damn well do.
Yes, you do, you damn well do.
Okay.
Okay.
Here it is, some advice -- do the hard thing.
Here it is, some advice -- do the hard thing.
That's it? That's what you're giving me?
That's it? That's what you're giving me?
Clean up the mess. No matter what it takes.
What it might take is... doing time.
Too bad. That's tough, I mean it. I'm not unsympathetic. But Skip says you're in love.
-- you can sit up and look at me if you'd like -- -- maybe it would be helpful if you told me a little about what brought you here.
Kind of impatient for a big-time headshrinker, aren't you? How 'bout you let me explain it my own way...
...but it's not really my school -- and this is very interesting -- it's the school from the next district --
-- Go on!
-- you crazy? You can't do this!
Sure I can, Lionel.
Sure I can, Lionel.
I'm a criminal lawyer -- you think I like my clients? I can't stand most of them! But I don't kick them out...
I'm a criminal lawyer -- you think I like my clients? I can't stand most of them! But I don't kick them out...
See that sign -- We retain the right to refuse service to anyone. I'm not going to charge you for this session, but I don't want to see you back here.
Don't you at least have a back door I can use?
Come out this way. There's no shame in getting a little therapy... is there, Althea?
Maybe some of us don't need this crap!
And it's the Hubble Telescope, not the Himball Telescope.
Hello, Lionel.
You've got to have the right ladder for the job. You don't know what you're doing, you can get yourself in trouble.
You've got to have the right ladder for the job. You don't know what you're doing, you can get yourself in trouble.
You're right, as usual. See you.
It's a country club. Don't worry about it.
Thanks for your help, Lionel.
But you know how to drive?
Sure.
Sure.
Got a license? But no car?

Don't need it.

Can you help Mom?

I'm trying.
I'm trying.
Got to.
What's wrong with her?
Is she a friend of yours?
Is she a friend of yours?
No... sort of. Man, she could be cool, but all she does is get wrecked and do all the guys. She's blowin' them in the parking lot.
Hiya, Doc.
Martin.
Martin.
Did you straighten her out?
How are you?
Insane! Didn't ja hear? My family got five hundred times better. Let's go, Vanessa.
Hello, Mother. I want you to meet Dr. Mumford.
Mumford... like the town?
What's happening here?
We're going for a walk.
We're going for a walk.
Do you think that's a good idea?
Do you think that's a good idea?
Dr. Mumford does, yes. I've put myself completely in his hands. For today, anyway.
Dr. Mumford does, yes. I've put myself completely in his hands. For today, anyway.
What kind of doctor are you?
It'll never happen! You're in big trouble, mister.
Mother... go away!
Ph.D., psychologist.
Oh... not a real doctor.
Oh... not a real doctor.
That's right, the fake kind.
What'd you want?
There's something I think we need to talk about.
There's something I think we need to talk about.
What?
Finally, some common sense...
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
I think you know what I mean.
I think you know what I mean.
No, I really don't.
No, I really don't.
I think you do.
I think you do.
Why don't you tell me?
Why don't you tell me?
Why don't you go to hell? It's all a bunch of nonsense and you know it.
Well... you see, the problem is --
-- the problem is you're a big fake. You haven't got a clue what's wrong with that girl.
Wow. You're something.
Take a hike, Dr. Quack!
Well, look who's here...
Good evening, Mrs. Cook.
Good evening, Mrs. Cook.
Just who is here, can you tell me?
Just who is here, can you tell me?
Could I see Sofie, please?
Could I see Sofie, please?
No, you can not. I wouldn't know who to say is calling.
Sofie. It's so obvious... you're after my daughter.
Well, I gotta say, Mrs. Cook, you're right about that.
Feel free to lie down. Most people do.
I'd better not, I'll fall right to sleep. I think it's too soon for me to be sleeping with you.
What can you tell me about this?
Oh, lord. It's almost too exhausting to tell you... ...about my exhaustion. I didn't really want to come. I'm not hopeful right now. But I couldn't take the look on my dad's face. He's a truly kind person, which is pretty extraordinary if you knew the story. He's the opposite of me, I guess -- all stamina and resolve.
When did you start to feel this way?
About six months ago, I guess it is now. God, it seems like years. What a bore! I'm embarrassed by it. Before this happened -- when I'd hear people talk about this kind of thing -- I thought it was a bunch of bullshit.
What?
You think that now! You think it's a bunch of hooey, don't you?
You think that now! You think it's a bunch of hooey, don't you?
No.
No.
I saw it. I saw it in your eyes.
That's okay. Maybe it is. My mother always says -- "Everything that's wrong with you is in your head." I suppose that's true.
Back when this started, was there anything unusual happening in your life? A change of job, of living situation... a loss of some kind?
Back when this started, was there anything unusual happening in your life? A change of job, of living situation... a loss of some kind?
No... but it started one year to the day after my divorce became final. That's not too suspicious, is it?... But it wasn't like I was feeling bad about the divorce. Just the opposite.

Hmm.

Even if you don't think it's real?
Even if you don't think it's real?
I don't know what's real and what isn't. That's never been my strong suit. But if you're tired all the time and you've had to give up the life you were having and come back home when you didn't want to... that's worth trying to fix. Maybe I can help you do that.

We... we would try several things. But I need to see you a lot.

I don't know. I barely made it today.
I don't know. I barely made it today.
I'll come to you. We'll try a little walking.
We'll take it slow. You'll never feel you can't handle it.
I don't think I can afford it. I don't want my dad paying.
I don't think I can afford it. I don't want my dad paying.
We'll work it out.
You have the best answer for everything. You seem so... hopeful. Are you always this sunny?
No one ever thought so. You must bring it out.

Can I ask you something? Didn't you tell my dad you didn't think it was a good idea to come to the patient? So what changed?
I'm not making any promises.
We'll turn back anytime you want.
We'll turn back anytime you want.
Oh boy... this should be interesting.
Mom's such a cutie.
People usually have to get to know me before they hate me.

Something's bothering her.

Oh, we've all disappointed her. Me, especially, but Dad, of course. She thinks my brother's all right, but she didn't expect much. It's what happens when you "marry beneath yourself"...
Please... forgive me.
What?
What?
Negative thinking makes everything more difficult. If you're going to have enough strength to do this, we have to talk only about positive things. All right?
Okay then... Are you positive your mother's a bitch? Just kidding.
You've got a funny idea of funny.
You've got a funny idea of funny.
I've offended you!
I've offended you!
No.
No.
Really? What would it take?
Is this the treatment?
Sorry... I'm done.
Sorry... I'm done.
'Cause I'll tell you, none of the others have tried this approach.
I'm embarrassed. The list is so long.
Be specific.
Be specific.
Well... I'm tired all the time, obviously. I always feel like taking a nap. But when I try to sleep, I have trouble. My muscles ache. And my joints. I feel like an old person, or like I did back when I used to work out too hard... What else?...
Sore throat?
Uh-huh.
Painful lymph glands? Forget fulness... irritability... depression?
Yes, yes, and definitely yes. Also... I get confused.
Yes, yes, and definitely yes. Also... I get confused.
Yeah, most people have that. It's confusing here.
Yeah, most people have that. It's confusing here.
Where?
Where?
Life.
I don't know if I mentioned the headaches.
Did you get headaches before this? But you get more now? Or more severe?
Did you get headaches before this? But you get more now? Or more severe?
No, not really. They're about the same. My marriage was one long headache.
No, not really. They're about the same. My marriage was one long headache.
So the headaches may not even be a part of this?
I can give myself a headache instantly.
Is that like a party trick?
Is that like a party trick?
All I have to do is have two conflicting thoughts at the same time... Like I'll think -- 'Taking these walks is going to help Sofie get better.' But then I'll also think -- 'Mumford, you just enjoy taking these walks and you're kidding yourself about the benefits.'
There... I've given myself a real whopper.
You actually address yourself by name in your thoughts? So you really think having two opposing ideas in your head does some kind of damage?

Well then, my life has been some kind of huge rip.
You're doing great.
I don't know if I'm going to make it the whole way.
I don't know if I'm going to make it the whole way.
It doesn't matter. Go on.
It doesn't matter. Go on.
Oh... this makes me sound irrational, which is probably right, but there was something about him saying this -- it was maybe the millionth time he'd told me about some preference of his. Well, I was so... tired of it. Seems like my whole life someone's been telling me... I'm just not getting it right. Can we rest for a second?
You're purposely making me talk while we do this... ...because you think this is good for me... ...and you're a sadistic bastard...
Yes.
Yes.
...who thinks there's nothing really wrong with me.
...who thinks there's nothing really wrong with me.
Oh, there's something wrong with you, all right. Especially after hearing that dream of yours, about the Roto-Rooter.
That was really bad, wasn't it?
Disgusting.
Disgusting.
And I'll bet you can interpret the whole thing
And I'll bet you can interpret the whole thing
It's pretty obvious to a trained professional.
Is that when you split up?
No, that'd be a good story, but that was just the beginning of the end. We went on for another year or so.
So whose route is this?
Brady Peck's. Fourteen years old. Lives next door.

When I was in high school we used to come up here and make out. I liked to sit on the rock and watch the sun go down.
That's what I like.
That's what I like.
Which thing?

I thought only action movies had villains like that.
-- you've been a tremendous help to me.
Yeah?
Yeah?
I can't tell you how much I admire you. You have a wonderful way with people. And you're very insightful. I feel like you've seen me clearly... I never used to admit what a horrible person my mother was. You've made that possible for me.

That's... good?
That's... good?
Yes! And my ex-husband -- he never accepted me for who I was, just like Mother. The things you've said have helped me understand what a dick he is.

I don't know if --

You're shockingly honest, that's what makes you great. I've never had a man treat me this way. With you, I feel really... listened to. Can I tell you something? It's a little embarrassing, but I feel very unguarded with you.

Of course.
Of course.
Thanks to this therapy, I now know what I'm looking for. I need to find a man like you. Not one who's treating me, of course. And I'm going to do it, dammit! You've given me the confidence.
I need to talk to you... Doctor. Can I come in?
Of course.
It might've been more appropriate if we had followed a traditional approach to the doctor-patient relationship.
Is something wrong, Sofie?
Is something wrong, Sofie?
Yes, something's very wrong, Dr. Mumford.
Yes, something's very wrong, Dr. Mumford.
You're upset.
You're upset.
How intuitive! That must take years of training right there. Maybe you can guess what has upset me.
Is it something you've heard about me?
No, it is not something I've heard about you! It is someth-- Why? Is there something I should have heard about you?
No, it is not something I've heard about you! It is someth-- Why? Is there something I should have heard about you?
Why don't you tell me what's on your mind?
All right... I'm going to come right out and say this, because that's what your shrink is for, right, so you can tell him what's bothering you?
Um-huh.
Um-huh.
First of all, I have been feeling much better lately. I don't know if the syndrome is over -- if it's just run its course or something -- but I feel a hundred per cent better than when I first came to you.

The point is this -- I am not a blank page. I did not just fall off the turnip truck. Do you know what I mean?

I think so.
I think so.
I know a little about psychology. I took three different courses in college. It's true, none of them were above the two hundred level, but I took them... And there was one concept I remember very well.

Transference!

Transference.
Yes, and that is what I have got right now. I have taken my feelings of gratitude... and relief... and transferred them onto... you. I have taken all those warm, grateful emotions and confused them with feelings for you... So that now I am under the delusion... ...that I am in love with you.
Hello?
Hello.
Hello.
I think you can understand why I have some serious questions about your methods. I mean, obviously it becomes much more likely that I'm going to have confusion about this when your idea of treatment is to go walking in the woods and up to make- outs-ville and do all these highly romantic activities --
Mother...
What do you think I'm after, Mrs. Cook?
I guess you saw the show...?
Which show was that?

Part of it. We were watching "ER" until someone called.

You probably got the idea.
...How violated I feel?
You're not the only one...
You feel violated?
Not me... all my other my patients. I smelled tar and feathers on the way over here.

You deserve it.
I am irate!
But...

But nothing... I'm mad as hell. This is a terrible thing you've done.
But nothing... I'm mad as hell. This is a terrible thing you've done.
I know it! Please believe me, I know that...
But, there is one... mitigating factor I want you to consider before you write me off.
What?
What?
Will you think about it?
Will you think about it?
I don't know. Depends. I'm in a bad mood.
I don't know. Depends. I'm in a bad mood.
I love you. More than I've ever loved anyone or anything in my life.
Oh.
I want to spend the rest of my life with you... but I'm not sure you feel the same way.
...but first, you have to tell me something...
Anything... just ask.
Anything... just ask.
What is your name?
You got off easy.
Will you wait for me?

We're only talking about six weeks.

Of course... I haven't got the energy to get out of town that fast.
...so he already had the tattoo that said, "Naomi Forever"... and now they're broken up, see, and he has to have it removed. But while the scar is still healing, or whatever you call it when you have a tattoo removed, he meets Chandra. And it's serious, immediate love. So in no time, he's gone from the most gorgeous model in the world to

Have women found you attractive?
I knew you wouldn't answer. I've been thinking about what you said last time. How me trying to lose weight -- and constantly not -- is like a lot of people with addictions. How maybe I can't lose the weight, ever... Which we already knew...
That's not quite what I said --
That's not quite what I said --
It's a really weird thing for a shrink to say... and then you said maybe people'd be happier if they'd accept that some things don't change -- that it'd be some kind of a relief or something...
Isn't she amazing? That is such a wicked look.
What do you want me to see?
What do you want me to see?
Just chill for a second. Look at this guy, it appears he's actually dead... but gorgeous.
What are you doing? We're not done. I just need to find the thing...

This shrink school you went to... did you hear about it on an infomercial?
There's this kid at school... Martin Brockett. He has some gigantic idea of himself that no one else shares. You wouldn't believe the crap he lays on me... Who appointed him my spiritual leader? If he has everything so figured out how come his best friend is a .22 rifle? And why's he spend all his time chasing after me? Probably thinks I'm gonna
Do you think that's what he wants?
Do you think that's what he wants?
No. I don't know what he wants. But I know I don't like being watched. Nobody's ever paid any attention to what I did, and I liked it just fine. Where does he get off telling me I disrespect myself? Fuck him. Look in a mirror, bozo.
...I mean, Doc, the dude is seriously deluded. I said that to him, I said, "If you think I'm gonna do all that shit for you, man, you are seriously deluded."
What'd he say?
What'd he say?
He said -- "Which we already knew!"
What did he want you to do?
First off, he tells me to stop smoking cigarettes. I told him abso-fuckin'- lutely no. As you can see --
...What balls on this guy? What're we... ...going steady? Jesus.
No again?
No again?
I said I'd consider it. Nobody owns me. And the last thing was insane. I don't know what's wrong with him... No magazines.

Really?
Really?
I don't know if I can quit. We're gonna try it together, like, you know, AA or something. And I made him give up his .22. No more sneaking around the hills with his fucking nut gun like some loony tune.

He's pitiful, Doc, a goddam puppy. I don't know how much longer I can put up with it. I already got two arms and legs, I don't need another appendage.
You're Doc Mumford. Skip Skipperton.
How are you?
How are you?
Fine. Okay. Pretty good. I've been hoping we'd meet. I've heard a lot about you.
..."Find the need and fill it" my dad used to say -- I guess a lot of dads say that -- but I did and it just took off.
No kidding... Panda. Where'd that come from?
No kidding... Panda. Where'd that come from?
Panda? I've always liked giant pandas... I've been to China and seen them in the wild. That's the kind of thing I can do if I want... now. I can do pretty much anything I want to do these days.
Would you like another beer?
Nah... scotch.
Nah... scotch.
Far out. Single malt? Can I pick it?
Can I ask you a personal question?
Of course! That's exactly what I want.
Of course! That's exactly what I want.
Have you thought about getting a wife?
I gotta pee. Can I ask you something? This town is called Mumford... Been that way since... 18... 18-0... 18-0... ...thirteen! Right? Now here's the question -- Your name is Mumford, too.
Is that the question?
Is that the question?
You moved here from back East and your name is the same as this town. Is that right? Far out.
I hope you don't think I want you to do this for free. Just because we're gonna play it like we're friends, doesn't mean I won't pay you like a doctor.
I understand.
I understand.
I have a lot of money. Do you know how much money I've got?

Skip, you're the head of the whole deal here. Are they busier than you?
Skip, you're the head of the whole deal here. Are they busier than you?
Well, you know... that's the thing. Like I said, just about everybody in town works for me. And it's just not the same asking someone to throw a ball when they work for you. It's like an order or something... And no one -- no one -- asks me.
So, would you say we're out here... let me think how to put this... Is your problem really that you're... lonely?
Don't you like this?
Don't you like this?
Hell yes, I like it. What's better than this? Most guys would kill just to have someone do this with them whenever they like.

So I guess Henry Follett is a patient of yours. He's my pharmacist.
Yeah. Guy's got some serious sex fantasies.
Pretty good, too. Lots of detail. Nothing hard core. Old-fashioned ones, from back when people cared about atmosphere and character.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Problem is, his fantasy life's a lot better than his real one. Nothing can live up to it. His wife got sick of it and left him. Took his kids with her.

I wondered what happened to her...
Hey, Skip.
Doc. I know we're not supposed to get together till Wednesday...
Doc. I know we're not supposed to get together till Wednesday...
That's all right. What's on your mind?
How many sessions have we had now, Doc? Six. And it's been good... like we were two buddies hanging out. Just shootin' the shit.
Yep.
I want to tell you something, Doc, but before I do, I need to ask you a question... Because, for me to tell you this thing -- well, I haven't told anybody about this. It's the biggest secret I've got.
Sometimes it's best to keep a few things just for ourselves.
Sometimes it's best to keep a few things just for ourselves.
You're a shrink, Doc. Aren't I supposed to be able to tell you everything?
You're a shrink, Doc. Aren't I supposed to be able to tell you everything?
It's just a thought.
Hey, maybe that's all right! I don't know all that much about psychology or therapy or... ethics, so maybe there's something I missed... or something...
You're concerned that maybe I can't be trusted with a secret.
You're concerned that maybe I can't be trusted with a secret.
I trust you. Definitely. No question. But, yeah, I'm a little concerned. I mean, you're not supposed to tell anyone about your patients' problems... are you?
Yeah, well... what I was gonna tell you --
-- Skip. Knowing what you do about me --
-- Skip. Knowing what you do about me --
Doc, I trust you! You've listened to me better than anybody... maybe ever. And this secret I've got, I can't stand it anymore. I don't know if I'm some kind of --
All right, I'm just gonna tell you, as simple and direct as I can. And you understand that this is a big secret? Just between us? Okay. You know I've got this gift for certain kinds of... machines.
You are Panda, monarch of modems.
You are Panda, monarch of modems.
That's right. And you also know that even though I make 23% of the modems in the world... I cannot make one simple connection with any woman who could truly love me.
That's right. And you also know that even though I make 23% of the modems in the world... I cannot make one simple connection with any woman who could truly love me.
Okay... let's say that, for now.
Okay... let's say that, for now.
It's true, believe me. So... do you know what I've been doing, all alone, in my workshop, for almost two years?... Mr. Find-the-Need-and-Fill- It. How I spend my every solitary hour?
Guess. Go ahead, guess!
Jerking off?
Jerking off?
No!... Although that's a good guess. No, what I've been working on, what the world really needs and no one has been able to create -- -- a virtually life-like, humanoid, gender-specific, anatomically functional... sexual surrogate slash companion.
Slash what?
Sexual surrogate... slash... companion.
Sexual surrogate... slash... companion.
A doll?
A doll?
No, Doc, not a doll. I am Panda. I'm talking about much, much more than a doll. The world has never seen what I'm talking about... except maybe in the movies.
How's it coming?
You don't think I'm insane?
You don't think I'm insane?
And that's your secret? You meant -- like a trade secret?
And that's your secret? You meant -- like a trade secret?
No, Doc, a private secret! It's perverted, it's pitiful. What am I -- Dr. Frankenstein? Aren't you repulsed?
No, Doc, a private secret! It's perverted, it's pitiful. What am I -- Dr. Frankenstein? Aren't you repulsed?
Sounds like kind of a good idea.

Really?
Really?
Definitely.
Skip, that's not much of a secret.
It's not?
It's not?
Oh, it's okay. It's just not something to be ashamed of. Maybe you don't want people knowing -- and believe me, it's safe with me -- but on the scale of dirty little secrets, I'd give it, say... a two.
Who else knows?
Just you.
Just you.
It's time you did some talkin', Dr. Mum -- Wait a minute. That is your name, isn't it?
Damn! What is your name?
Doesn't matter. You can call me Doc.
Doesn't matter. You can call me Doc.
It matters to me.
I've told you a lot of private stuff.
I can tell you anything else.
I can tell you anything else.
What about everything? How did this happen?
But there was one job that looked like it might be fun -- Investigator.
Are you telling me your last job before becoming a psychologist was --
-- an investigator for the Internal Revenue Service?
Everybody has a story, Skip.
Everybody has a story, Skip.
Sounds like you have several.
Sounds like you have several.
What it felt like was... a series of separate, unconnected lives -- hillbilly kid, wrecked college boy, garbage man, civil service guy... ...et cetera... et cetera. Every time I'd leave a life, it felt good. Whatever problems I was having were suddenly gone. I had no friends and I didn't talk to my family. The only constant, stabilizing force in my life was... drugs.

Did you carry a gun?
Did you carry a gun?
Didn't need one. We didn't even need a warrant for most of the shit we did. Man, the IRS... we could go in your bank account, your credit cards... hell, we used to go into doctors' files and get all the juicy details. Nobody wants to argue with the IRS.
Of course, him being insane didn't make it all right that I fell in love with his wife.
Holy shit!
"Get to know your therapist."
You were messed up, man.
You were messed up, man.
But look at me now...
But look at me now...
Hey, you've done good. Look at yourself... you've cleaned up, you've got a career --
At least you pulled yourself out...
Things got a lot worse.
Things got a lot worse.
You and Candy...?
And the drugs?
Harder than I thought. Took me three tries. But I was highly motivated -- figured there was no point in leaving me and taking that along. After two bomb-outs, I found a place in the desert...
Somebody's taking a shower down there.
That'd be Lily.
That'd be Lily.
I wish I could live in the shower. I'd take five a day if I had the time. I went to this spa in Germany, a sanitarium practically, up on this mountain. And the great thing -- they just kept you wet all day.

You know how easy it is. A kid can manage it if he wants a fake I.D. You can do practically the whole deal at your local Kinko's. The only variable is how much pride you take in the product.

"Mumford"... I mean, why pick the name of the town you were going to?
"Mumford"... I mean, why pick the name of the town you were going to?
Oh. You got it backwards. I already had the name when I started looking for somewhere to settle. When I saw this town on a map, I thought maybe it was a sign. See...
And a birth certificate is enough?
Everything flows from that, and what doesn't... can be easily purchased.
But you studied psychology, right? You did the training and just never got the degree?
No... no training.
No... no training.
Psych major?

Jeez, man. But you're good at it!
Jeez, man. But you're good at it!
I understand what it's like to want to leave a problem behind. That's all most people are looking to do. Mainly, I listen.
Where ya going? I've got a million questions.
See you Thursday... regular time.
I've never brought anyone down here before.
I'm honored.
I'm honored.
Doc, there's something about what you told me the other night I can't get out of my head. It's driving me batty -- Why me? How did you know you could trust me?
Doc, there's something about what you told me the other night I can't get out of my head. It's driving me batty -- Why me? How did you know you could trust me?

Skip, I've got a problem and I need some advice.
You want my advice? Far out!
Pretty creepy, huh? Are you totally disgusted?
Skip, you're a visionary. That can be a burden.

What'd I do?
Lily.
Lily... ...Skip, that's great! You and Lily.
Lily... ...Skip, that's great! You and Lily.
Oh, she doesn't know about it yet. Right now, of the two of us, I'm the only one in love. But I'm very stoked.
Sorry...
Wow.
I'm here for you, Doc.
Skip, you know that it's improper -- completely unethical -- for a licensed psychologist to carry on a romantic relationship with one of his patients?

I guess that makes sense.
I guess that makes sense.
Yes, yes it does...
Doc!... It's not me, is it?
What?
Hmm. I guess that doesn't help... I see where you're going here. It's a mess.
Yep.
Forgive me, please. What a gracious thought. We must do that.
When?
When?
Why don't I call you when I've got my calendar in front of me?
It's possible. I don't know about that.
I suppose your extended training was at an institution in that area?
I suppose your extended training was at an institution in that area?
Lots of institutions. My graduate advisor believed we should experience as many environments as possible -- prisons, clinics, half-way houses. For a while I was chief therapist in a shopping mall. Had a little spot next to the yogurt place.
I trained in the east, myself -- Cornell -- and I don't care what anyone says, there really are regional differences. I found the state certification exams out here quite harrowing... Did you?
Oh, yeah, very tough. But I guess that's good... to keep out the quacks.
Oh, yeah, very tough. But I guess that's good... to keep out the quacks.
Which examiner did you have? I probably know him.
Which examiner did you have? I probably know him.
Wallace Franklin... from Greensburg.
That was a terrible thing.
I don't even know why hang-gliding is considered a legitimate sport.
Yes... your particular approach.
I don't have one really. Most of the time I'm faking it. See, I think there's not much that can be done about most problems... they're too complicated, too deep-rooted by the time I hear about them. The most I can do, usually, is look and listen real closely, try to catch some glimpse of the secret life everybody's got. If I can get
I told you to leave or die, you refused, and now you may have killed us all. For you have unleashed the creature that we have feared for more than four thousand years.
Relax, I got him.
Relax, I got him.
No mortal weapons can kill this creature. He is not of this world.
No mortal weapons can kill this creature. He is not of this world.
Are we talkin, about the same creature? The walking corpse? Really big mouth? Really bad breath?
You know where he's taking her?
Yes. To Hamunaptra. To perform the ritual.
Who the hell are these guys?
Priests. Imhotep's priests.
I never killed a priest before.
They are evil, cursed, they matter not.
They are evil, cursed, they matter not.
Well, okay then.
We saved him! Saved him before the creature could finish his work. Now leave, all of you, quickly, before he finishes you all.
You're not going to kill us?
And what ritual would that be?
The ritual to bring the body of Anck- su-namun back to life.
The ritual to bring the body of Anck- su-namun back to life.
And how does one do that?

By reading the Book Of The Dead.

Oh yes, of course.

And then killing your sister.
And then killing your sister.
Excuse me?
If he arrives before us, it will be too late.
Did you say 'kill' my sister?
Personally, I would like to surrender. Why can we not just surrender?
Shut-up and gimme your bandolier.
Now go find me a big stick.
In the desert? What for?
How'd a guy like you end up in the Legion anyways?
I got caught robbing a synagogue. Lots of good stuff in them holy places; churches, temples, mosques, and who's guarding them?
I got caught robbing a synagogue. Lots of good stuff in them holy places; churches, temples, mosques, and who's guarding them?
Altar boys?
Altar boys?
Exactly! I speak seven languages, including Hebrew, so my specialty was synagogues. How about you? Kill somebody?
What then? Robbery? Extortion? Kidnapping!
None of the above, thank you.
None of the above, thank you.
Then what the hell are you doing here!?
My very good friend! What a surprise.
Why if it ain't my little buddy, Beni. I oughta kill you.
You never were any good with the ladies, O'Connell.
So you're the one leading the Americans, I shoulda figured. So what's the scam? You get 'em out in the middle of the desert then leave 'em to rot?
So you're the one leading the Americans, I shoulda figured. So what's the scam? You get 'em out in the middle of the desert then leave 'em to rot?
Unfortunately no, these Americans are smart, they pay me only half now, half when I get them back to Cairo, so I must go all the way.
The girl saved my life, figured it was the least I could do, keep her out of trouble.
You always did have more balls than brains.
Let's make us even, shall we?
Even?
O'Connell! I am going to kill you for this!
Sounds familiar.
Hey O'Connell! Looks to me like I got all the horses!
Hey Beni! Looks to me like your on the wrong side of the river!
Ten to one, O'Connell, your odds are no-so-good.
I've had worse.
Goin' somewhere?
Just looking for you, O'Connell! I wanted to be with my friend!
C'mon, friend.
Why do you like to fight so much?
Why do you like to fight so much?
'Cause I look good doin, it.
Beni ya little stinkweed, where did you slink off to?
You left me! You left me in the desert to rot.
You left me! You left me in the desert to rot.
Oh yeah,... sorry bout that. So who's this guy?
Oh yeah,... sorry bout that. So who's this guy?
This is Prince Imhotep, High Priest of Osiris.
This is Prince Imhotep, High Priest of Osiris.
Oh, hey, how ya doin'?
The Prince does not like to be touched by other humans. A Silly eastern superstition, I'm afraid.
Yeah, well, we all got our little problems today don't we?
Yeah, well, we all got our little problems today don't we?
He has come to help Mister Burns. Somehow I feel responsible.
He has come to help Mister Burns. Somehow I feel responsible.
Don't gimme that, you never had any scruples.
Don't gimme that, you never had any scruples.
Do you know where I can steal some?
Where's your new friend?
What friend? You're my only friend.
Then you got no excuse for living. What the hell you doin, being buddies with this creep, Beni? What's in it for you?
It is better to be the right hand of the Devil,... than in his path. As long as I serve him, I am immune.
It is better to be the right hand of the Devil,... than in his path. As long as I serve him, I am immune.
Immune from what?
Immune from what?
You shall see.
You shall see.
What are you looking for? Lie, and I'll slit your throat.
The book! The black book they found at Hamunaptra! Imhotep wants it back. Said to me it would be worth it's weight in diamonds.
What does he want the book for?
What does he want the book for?
Something about bringing his dead girly-friend back to life. He needs the book... And your sister.
Like what that Moses guy did to that Pharaoh guy?
That's one way of putting it.
What just happened?
All I remember is him turning into a blast of sand,... and then I remember nothing.
Yeah?
Oh yes, always.
...and how do you say? Those slimy things, in your stomach?
Intestines.
Intestines.
Yeah! Them.
I'm sorry, it was an accident.
When Ramesses destroyed Syria, it was an accident. You are a catastrophe! Why do I put up with you?
You put up with me, because I can read and write ancient Egyptian, decipher hieroglyphs and hieratic, and I'm the only person within a thousand miles who knows how to properly code and catalogue this library.
Who needs smart women? I put up with you because your mother and father were our finest patrons, Allah rest their souls. Now straighten up this mess!
See the cartouche there, it's the official royal seal of Seti the First, I'm sure of it.
Perhaps.
Miss Carnavon. Gentlemen.
What is he doing here?
What is he doing here?
Do you truly wish to know? Or would you prefer to just shoot us?
And you think this justifies killing innocent people!?
To have stopped this creature? Yes!
In the necropolis, when I saw him, - alive,... walking, he called me Anck- su-namun. And then in Mister Burns' quarters he tried to kiss me.
It is because it was you who read from the Book. He has chosen you to be the human sacrifice needed to regenerate the body of Anck-su-namun.
I'm thinking that if the black Book Of The Dead can bring people back to life --
-- then perhaps, the golden Book Of The Living can return them to the underworld.
-- then perhaps, the golden Book Of The Living can return them to the underworld.
Exactly --
She is like all the others. She will die in the desert.
No! She has seen too much. She knows too much.
The key!? She has the lost key!?
Yes. No one has ever had so much, been so close. We must stop her, or it will be the end of us all.
Yes. No one has ever had so much, been so close. We must stop her, or it will be the end of us all.
Then we will kill her, we will kill her and all those with her.
Then we will kill her, we will kill her and all those with her.
And burn the map and retrieve the key.
And burn the map and retrieve the key.
It will be done. But what of the American expedition? They leave tomorrow as well.
It will be done. But what of the American expedition? They leave tomorrow as well.
Forget the bumbling Americans, they will be like all the others. Without the map to guide them, how can they possibly find Hamunaptra?
I'm willin, to go on a little faith, here.
You will not believe it.
You will not believe it.
Try me.
Okay, let's cut to the chase. He's afraid of cats, what's that about?
According to the ancients, cat's are the guardians at the gates of the underworld. Imhotep will fear them until he is fully regenerated, and then he will fear nothing.
So your sayin', if we find the book made outta gold --
-- And read the sacred incantations contained inside it.
-- And read the sacred incantations contained inside it.
You think it'll send this guy back to hell?
You think it'll send this guy back to hell?
Correct, And that's when --
Which would be located not far to the east of the Anubis statue.
Don't tell me we gotta go back out there?
Don't tell me we gotta go back out there?
If we want to kill the creature, yes.
See! That proves it! Old Seti's fortune's gotta be under this sand!
For them to protect it like this, you just know there's got to be treasure down there.
I wouldn't trade ya for a brass spittoon!
Yeah! It's supposed to be made outta pure gold!
The sun turning black.
Water turning to blood.
You bastards!
What did you do to him!?
The hell with that! I'm not goin' nowhere! We're safe here.
Yeah, I'm not leavin, this fort for nothin'.
The hell with this. I'm goin, downstairs to get me a drink. You want somethin'?
Yeah, get me a glass of bourbon, a shot of bourbon and a bourbon chaser.
And what is he in prison for?
I did not know, so when I heard you were coming, I asked him that myself.
I did not know, so when I heard you were coming, I asked him that myself.
And what did he say?
And what did he say?
He said... he was just looking for a good time.
Where are they taking him?
To be hanged.
No women allowed.
I am an English woman.
I will give you one hundred pounds to spare his life.
I would pay one hundred pounds just to see him hang.
I would pay one hundred pounds just to see him hang.
Two hundred pounds.
Two hundred pounds.
Proceed!
Proceed!
Three hundred pounds!
You lie.
I would never!
Are you saying this filthy godless son of a pig knows where to find The City Of The Dead? Truly?
Yes and if you cut him down, we will give you ten percent.
Yes and if you cut him down, we will give you ten percent.
Fifty percent.
Fifty percent.
Twenty.
Twenty.
Forty.
A bright good morning to all.
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
I have come to protect my investment, thank you very much.
Do you realize, we are standing inside a room that no one has entered in over four thousand years.
Who cares? I don't see no treasure.
So who's the broad?
Broad?!
We uh,... found... your puzzle box, and we've come to ask you about it.
No.
No.
No?
No?
No... You came to ask me about Hamunaptra.
How do you know the box pertains to Hamunaptra?
Because that's where I found it. I was there.
You were actually at Hamunaptra?
I just decked your brother
I just decked your brother
Yes, well... I know my brother.
Yeah, I was there.
You swear?
You swear?
Every damn day.
Every damn day.
No, I mean --
No, I mean --
-- I know what you mean. I was there, alright. Seti's place. The City Of The Dead.
-- I know what you mean. I was there, alright. Seti's place. The City Of The Dead.
What did you find? What did you see?
What did you find? What did you see?
I found sand. I saw death.
Could you tell me how to get there? The exact location?
Want to know?
Yes.
Really want to know?
Give... give him... give him GLAAAA-- !
Twenty-five percent, and not one single farthing more.
Sorry, didn't mean to scare ya.
The only thing that scares me, Mister O'Connell, are your manners.
The only thing that scares me, Mister O'Connell, are your manners.
Still angry that I kissed ya, huh?
Still angry that I kissed ya, huh?
If you call that a kiss.
Did I miss something? Are we going into battle?
The last time I was at that place everybody I was with died.
There's something out there, you know, something under that sand.
Yes, I'm hoping to find a certain artifact, a book, actually, my brother thinks there's treasure. What do you think is out there?
Evil. The Tuaregs and the Bedouin believe that Hamunaptra is cursed, they call it, "the doorway to hell."
Ahmar is Ossirion. "Passageway to the underworld", actually.
I don't believe in fairy tales and hokum, Mister O'Connell, but I do believe that one of the most famous books in history is buried out there, The Book Of The Living. It's what first interested me in Egypt as a child. It's why I came here, sort of a life's pursuit.
And the fact that they say it's made out of pure gold, makes no nevermind to you, right?
You know your history.
I know my treasure.
Relax! I'm the map! It's all up here.
Oh that's comforting.
Can you swim?
Well of course I can swim, if the occasion calls for it.
Well of course I can swim, if the occasion calls for it.
Trust me.
We're almost there.
Are you sure?
For what?
We're about to be shown the way.
That "thing" gets me excited.
The things that get you excited.
The things that get you excited.
According to Bembridge Scholars, inside the statue of Anubis was a secret compartment, perhaps containing The Book Of The Living.

What are those mirrors for?
What are those mirrors for?
Ancient Egyptian trick. You'll see.
Oh my god, It's a preparation room.
Preparation for what?
Preparation for what?
For entering the afterlife.
Yeah, that'd bring you back to life.
You two are worse than a couple of schoolboys.
Oh my god,... it looks like, it looks like a sarcophagus.
Why would they bury somebody in the ceiling?
Why would they bury somebody in the ceiling?
They didn't, they buried him at the foot of Anubis. He was either someone of great importance. Or he did something very naughty.
There's some sort of lock here. You say these thing's are made of granite with a steel interior?
Quarried granite with a cobalt lining.
A key! That's it! That's what he was talking about.
Who was talking about what?
Seems the Americans had a little misadventure of their own today, three of their diggers were killed.
How?
How?
Salt acid. Pressurized salt acid. Some sort of ancient booby-trap.
You two!
You don't believe in curses, huh?
You don't believe in curses, huh?
No. I believe if I can see it and I can touch it, then it's real. That's what I believe.
Unlike your brother, Miss, you I don't get. You're a whole new brew.
I know, you're wondering, what's a place like me doing in a girl like this?
I know, you're wondering, what's a place like me doing in a girl like this?
Something like that.
Something like that.
Egypt is in my blood. My father was a famous explorer, he loved Egypt so much that he married an Egyptian. My mother! Who was quite an adventurer herself
Egypt is in my blood. My father was a famous explorer, he loved Egypt so much that he married an Egyptian. My mother! Who was quite an adventurer herself
Okay, I get your father, I get your mother and I get your brother, but what are you doing here?
I may not be an explorer, or an adventurer, or a treasure hunter, or a gunfighter! Mister O'Connell But I'm proud of what I am.
And what is that?
I'm going to kiss you, Mister O'Connell.
No you're not.
No you're not.
I'm not?
I'm not?
Not unless you call me Rick.
Not unless you call me Rick.
Why would I do that?
Why would I do that?
Because that's my name.
No... Why?... Should I?
Gee, yeah, you told me it was the best time you ever had.
Oh my god, I've dreamed about this ever since I was a little girl.
You dream about dead guys?
Is he supposed to look like that?
No. I've never seen a mummy look like this. He's, he's still...
Are you saying somebody threw these things in with our guy, and they slowly ate him alive?
Very slowly.
According to my readings, our friend suffered the HOM-DAI, the worst of all ancient Egyptian curses, one reserved for only the most evil blasphemers. In all of my research, I've never read of this curse actually having been performed.
That bad huh?
That bad huh?
Yes, they never used it because they feared it so. It's written, that if a victim of the HOM-DAI should ever arise, he would bring with him the ten plagues of Egypt.
Yes, they never used it because they feared it so. It's written, that if a victim of the HOM-DAI should ever arise, he would bring with him the ten plagues of Egypt.
The ten plagues?... You mean all ten plagues.
You sure you outta be playin, around with that?
It's just a book, no harm ever came from a book.
Having an encounter with a four thousand year old walking-talking corpse tends to convert one.
Forget it, we're out the door down the hall and gone.
Forget it, we're out the door down the hall and gone.
No, we are not.
No we are not. We woke him up, and we must try and stop him.
We?! What we?! You didn't read that book. I told you not to play around with that thing.
We?! What we?! You didn't read that book. I told you not to play around with that thing.
Alright then, Me, I,... I read the book, I woke him up and I intend to stop him.
Then we'll have to find some immortal ones.
There goes that belief again. Not me, I am outta here!
According to that Book, once this creature has been reborn, his curse will spread, and as he grows in strength, so will his curse grow, infecting the people until the whole of the earth is destroyed.
Yeah? So? Is that my problem?
Yeah? So? Is that my problem?
It's everybody's problem!
It's everybody's problem!
Look lady, I appreciate you saving my life and all, but when I signed on, I agreed to take you out there and bring you back, and I did, now were even, end of job, end of story, contract terminated.

You can either tag along with me, or you can stay here and play around with Mister Maggot.
You can either tag along with me, or you can stay here and play around with Mister Maggot.
I'm staying.
I'm staying.
FINE.
He's here! I saw him! That thing is here!
The creature!? Are you sure!?
You called me your girl?
What?... Oh yeah, that was just um, you know, figure a speech.
What?... Oh yeah, that was just um, you know, figure a speech.
I think you were jealous
I think you were jealous
Jealous? You kiddin' me? Did you see that guy's face?
Got it!
Got what?
Don't do it, Evelyn.
I have no choice.
Got guts, lady.
Yes, I know, and I'd like to keep them.
You...! YOU...!
Drunkard? Fool? Rat-bastard? Please call me something original.
Have you no respect for the dead?
Right now, I only wish to join them.
Well I wish you'd do it sooner rather than later, before you ruin my career the way you've ruined yours.
My dear, sweet, baby sister, I'll have you know, that at this moment my career is on a high note.
Oh yes I do! I have something right here!
Oh no, not another worthless trinket, Jonathan, if I bring one more piece of junk to the Curator to try and sell for you.
Jonathan?
Yes?
Yes?
I think you found something.
Two questions. Who the hell is Seti the First? And was he rich?
He was the last Pharaoh of the Old Kingdom, said to be the wealthiest Pharaoh of them all.
He was the last Pharaoh of the Old Kingdom, said to be the wealthiest Pharaoh of them all.
Alright, good, that's good. I like this fellow, like him very much.
Yes. The City of The Dead. Where the early Pharaohs were said to have hidden the wealth of Egypt.
Right, right, in a big underground treasure chamber. Everybody knows the story. The entire necropolis was rigged to sink into the sand. On Pharaoh's command, a flick of the switch! And the whole place could disappear beneath the dunes.

All we know is that the city mysteriously vanished around 2,134 B.C.
You told me you found it on a dig down in Thebes!
I was mistaken.
I was mistaken.
You lied to me!
You lied to me!
I lie to everybody, what makes you so special?
I lie to everybody, what makes you so special?
I'm your sister.
I'm your sister.
That just makes you more gullible.
That just makes you more gullible.
You stole it from a drunk at the local Casbah?!
You stole it from a drunk at the local Casbah?!
Picked his pocket, actually.
But he's just a filthy criminal?
Way to go, Evy.
Do you really think he'll show up?
Undoubtedly, I know the breed, he may be a cowboy, but his word is his word.
Undoubtedly, I know the breed, he may be a cowboy, but his word is his word.
Personally, I think he's filthy, rude and a complete scoundrel. I don't like him one bit.
Ah, begging your pardon, but shouldn't we be going?
After all, you rode us night and day to win that bet.
According to my calculations, we should be right under the statue. We'll come up right between his legs. Oh my.
And when those dirty Yanks go to sleep -- No offense.
It's called mummification. You're dead when they do this
Still...
What do you suppose killed him?
Did you ever see him eat?
I can't believe I allowed the two of you to get me drunk.
Don't blame me, I don't even remember being there.
Don't blame me, I don't even remember being there.
Well neither do I, thank you.
Juicy?
Yes. He's more than four thousand years old and still decomposing.
I found it, Evy! I found it
Shut-up and get me off of here!
What do I do, Evy!? What do I do!?
Read the inscription on the cover!
Finish the inscription, idiot!
Oh.
Ummm, Hootash im... Hootash im now what is this last symbol here?
What's it look like!?
Ah! Ah! Ahmenophus!
Yes,... I see.
She's my sister, actually.
Yeah? Well,... I'm sure she's not a total loss.
Hey,... don't I know you?
Um, well, you see...
Sit down, O'Connell, sit down, we could use another good player.
I only gamble with my life, never my money.
I can't believe the price of these fleabags.
We coulda had 'em for free, all we had to do was give 'em your sister.
We coulda had 'em for free, all we had to do was give 'em your sister.
Yes, awfully tempting, wasn't it?
Yes, awfully tempting, wasn't it?
Awfully.
That thing gives me the creeps.
Be nice. That thing saved my life.
You're welcome to my share of the spider webs.
And it stinks to high heaven in here.
None taken.
We'll sneak up and steal that book right out from under them.
We'll sneak up and steal that book right out from under them.
And you're sure you can find the secret compartment?
Lemme get this straight, they stuck a sharp, red hot poker up your nose, cut your brain into small pieces, then ripped it all out through your nostrils?
OWCH! That's really got to hurt.
Whoever's in here, sure wasn't getting out.
No kiddin', without a key, it'll take us a month to crack this thing,
Tough break.
Yes, I'm all tears, now let's see who's inside, shall we?
Where's my gun?
What are you going to do? Shoot him?
What are you going to do? Shoot him?
If he decides to wake up, hell yes!
You did not!?... We're not!?
Rat gizzards. They smell bad and taste worse, but that's the best the desert has to offer.
He certainly was not a popular fellow when they planted him.
Must of got a little too frisky with the Pharaoh's daughter.
Did you see that!? Grasshoppers! Billions of grasshoppers!
That's one of the plagues, right? The grasshopper plague!
Who's here!?
The guy! The Priest! THE MUMMY!
That looked rather painful.
Ya know, ever since I met you, my luck has been for crap.
Ya know, ever since I met you, my luck has been for crap.
Yes, I know, I do that to people.
Damn-it! That's two down and only two to go.
And then he'll be coming after Evy.
Believe it, sister. That's what brought our buddy back to life.
And now he's going to use it to bring his girlfriend back
What?
What?
We gotta get her back.
I'm with you, old man. No one touches my sister like that and gets away with it.
Okay, now what the hell does this Horus guy look like?
He's a big fellow with pointy ears and a face like a falcon.
He's a big fellow with pointy ears and a face like a falcon.
Got it.
Do something, Jonathan! Kill it!
You have got to be joking?
I knew you'd come. I left that skylight open for you.
I know you did.
I know you did.
I knew you'd know.
I knew you'd know.
I know you knew I'd know.
I know you knew I'd know.
But did you know I knew you'd know I'd know?
But did you know I knew you'd know I'd know?
Of course.
The jig is up, Casanova. I've spent six months watching you, and know exactly what you're up to.
Really?
Really?
I know that you're recruiting your old henchmen...
And I know the terrible revenge that you plan to inflict on this city.
I guess you know just about everything, don't you, Lance?
I guess you know just about everything, don't you, Lance?
Um-hmm.
Um-hmm.
Except for one little thing.
Except for one little thing.
And what's that?
And what's that?
That I've hot wired the city's entire power supply through that catwalk.
That I've hot wired the city's entire power supply through that catwalk.
What --?
Everything's going exactly as we planned.
Not quite. You haven't announced our engagement yet.
Not quite. You haven't announced our engagement yet.
It must have slipped my mind.
It must have slipped my mind.
Your mind is so slippery.
Your mind is so slippery.
Don't worry, Pootchkie. My womanizing days are over. You're my Lady Macbeth, my Imelda... my Nicole. We're such an incredible team. Who could possibly stop us?
Where are you going?
Head hunting.
What are you doing all alone in the dark?
Fantasizing... about you.
I thought you were done?
One last tweak.
Our guests are waiting.
I'll be down in a jiffy.
You two timing psychotic bastard.
Darling, you've got the wrong idea.
Darling, you've got the wrong idea.
Do I?
Do I?
I was only strangling her... I've killed hundreds of women. It doesn't mean a thing. Pootchkie, you're over-reacting. This is our night. It's what we've lied for... cheated for... murdered for. She's just a plaything, a trifle... You're the only woman who's ever meant anything to me. I adore you. I worship you. I want to make you my bride.
The Bowler? I remember him from when I was a kid. He was killed years ago.
I'm his daughter.
Look, honey, being a superhero... it's a guy thing.
Really?
And then one day, he didn't come home. The police said it was an accident. But cargo containers don't just fall on people. He was murdered... After that I fell apart. I dropped out of school, became a mud wrestler, married and divorced a jerk. When my mother died I hit bottom... but then, when I was cleaning out her attic, I found my
So who killed him?
So who killed him?
The Disco Boys.
We didn't think this through very well.
My father had this friend... He was an inventor...
He was the last time I saw him.
When was that?
When was that?
I was eight.
Much less go outside.
Then Captain Amazing appeared.
We could really use some coffee --
And some sandwiches --
Come on, baby!
Do it, big boy!
Atta, girl!
Atta, boy!
Hey, do I look like a Man?
Well we can't call ourselves the Mystery People.
Who are you?
I'm the Bowler.
And you can't count Horst Buckholtz anyway.
He was cute though.
He was cute though.
But they all had one thing we haven't got.
How about... the Savage Six?
The Inscrutable Six?
But she's your mother. You gotta tell her.
I can't.
I'm her only son, and she always had such high hopes for me. Medicine. Law.
But you're a superhero.
But you're a superhero.
The cape. The turban. She wouldn't understand.
The cape. The turban. She wouldn't understand.
I know... My girlfriends all dumped me after I put on the mask. They thought I'd lost it.
I know... My girlfriends all dumped me after I put on the mask. They thought I'd lost it.
But in fact... you'd found it.
It's late. I'm headin' home.
Me, too.
Me, too.
Come on, Junior, it's a school night.
No one will believe us.
They'll think we're just a bunch of weirdoes.
Sounds good to me.
Let's do it.
But that place is huge and we don't know where this psycho thing is --
Or even what it looks like.
Hey... Can I buy you a beer?
I thought you'd never ask.
That's two more than the Fantastic Four.
Half a Dirty Dozen!
Casanova said that in two days the entire city would belong to him... and there wasn't a thing that we could do about it.
What did he mean?
What did he mean?
I dunno.
Mon Captain, it's for you.
Hello?
Hey... you okay?
Sure.
Eat your mustard.
It doesn't matter what we call ourselves. We know who we are.
Yes!
Doctor Heller?
Doctor Heller?
Yes!
Yes!
It's me... Elizabeth.
It's me... Elizabeth.
Elizabeth! Little Elizabeth! Why you're so... middle aged!
Elizabeth! Little Elizabeth! Why you're so... middle aged!
Thanks.
Thanks.
How's your dad?
How's your dad?
He's dead.
He's dead.
Oh that's right -- they squished him... Heck of a guy.
Doc, these are my friends. We're superheroes, and we need your help.
Well, I give to the United Way, and I feel that sort of covers --
Snap out of it!
Get on to yourself!
He'll never make it.
Think positive.
I hope you enjoy these cigars. I had to kill a dozen Cubans to get them.
Ummm.
Ummm.
Have you considered my offer?
Have you considered my offer?
You know, Mr. F, me and the boys always loved workin' for you. You had such style: the clothes, the dancin', the elegant way you'd snuff a babe. You were the King...
But times have changed, and you been in that bug house a long tine. I can see you still got the style, but I dunno for sure you still got the edge.
I got it.
I got it.
What about Captain Amazing?
Superheroes.
Should I kill them?
Should I kill them?
Why bother?
That boy's got talent.
And I'm gonna nip it in the bud.
What did you do with Captain Amazing?
Captain who?
I'll let you in on a little secret, Roy. In two days this entire city will belong to me, and there's not a damn thing your little pals can do about it. It's the perfect time to switch teams... So what do you say?
You're nuts.
You're nuts.
They always call the great ones nuts.
They always call the great ones nuts.
And the nuts always call themselves great.
And the nuts always call themselves great.
Are you with me... or against me?
Are you with me... or against me?
Against.
Against.
Too bad. PLUG HIM!
Thanks for reminding me which team I'm on.
You're dead.
You're dead.
So are you!
And the light goes out...
Frankenstein!
Let me guess... Bullets don't hurt you.
They hurt... BUT THEY DON'T STOP ME!
I hope you won't take this the wrong way, but I couldn't help but notice... that you're a dead ringer for Veronica Lake in "The Blue Dahlia".
Really?
Are you an actress?
Just a waitress.
Just a waitress.
You underestimate yourself.
You know I'm writing a play -- it's just a little Broadway thing, but there's a part in it that I think you'd be perfect for.
Really?
Really?
I'd love to hear you read it. Could you stick around after the luncheon?
I'd love to hear you read it. Could you stick around after the luncheon?
Sure -- I guess.
Sure -- I guess.
Terrific.
Hi.
I thought you'd chickened out on me.
I thought you'd chickened out on me.
Just wanted to... powder my nose.
How 'bout giving me "the tour"?
Why not?
Who's the artist?
Me.
Come here.
I'm not that kind of girl.
I'm not that kind of girl.
Then why are you here?

Curiosity.

Remember the cat.
I'd better go.
You're a spy.
You're a spy.
What?
What?
I saw him walk you home.
I saw him walk you home.
Who?
Who?
Roy.
Stay away!
Or you'll what? CAN ME?
Doesn't it piss you off the way the when you really want to talk to somebody you can't think of anything to say!
I guess... Are you always so angry?
I guess... Are you always so angry?
Only when I'm awake... You busy after work?
Or talk?
Not tonight.
Hi.
Alone tonight?
Alone tonight?
Every night.
Monica... I was wondering if -- uh -- maybe we -- I mean you and I -- could -- uh -- you know -- get a -- I mean have a...
Date?
Date?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I get off work in fifteen minutes. Walk me home?
I get off work in fifteen minutes. Walk me home?
Sure.
Sure.
That was easy.
I admire you.
Why?
Why?
Being a superhero, wanting to save the world. It's so... unselfish.

Most people just want to make money or be famous or something. But you risk everything, just to help people.

I wouldn't mind being famous.
I wouldn't mind being famous.
Who wouldn't?
I've never been able to figure out what to do with my life, which is why I guess I'm still a waitress.
Nothing wrong with being a waitress.

What's your real name?
What's your real name?
Roy.
Roy.
Have you always lived here?
Me too... I love this stupid old town. It's noisy. It's smelly. It's falling apart.
It's home.
It's home.
Yeah.
I've thought of leaving, going to Chicago or New York, but...
What have they got that we ain't got?
What have they got that we ain't got?
Champion's going to bounce back, and I want to be here when it does.

Me, too.

You don't seem very angry right now.
You know what? Underneath all that anger I think there's just a little boy who wants everyone to love him.
I just want to be a superhero.
I just want to be a superhero.
That's what I mean... 'Night, Roy.
It's me.
Monica, where are you?
At the Frankenstein Center.
Are you nuts? Get out of there!
Are you nuts? Get out of there!
I'm going inside.
I'm going inside.
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
Listen, Casanova may be a supervillain, but he's got a weakness, and I'm it. Maybe -- just maybe -- I can trick him into showing me the location of the whatchamathing.

He's a psycho! He'll kill you!

Just shut up and listen. Hold off the attack as long as you can. If I can discover the location I'll call you --
Just shut up and listen. Hold off the attack as long as you can. If I can discover the location I'll call you --
And what if you get killed?
And what if you get killed?
Then at least I will have died trying, right?
Roy... We might never see each other again, so I'd better tell you now... I think you're wonderful.
What?
What?
Bye.
Bye.
Monica!
So, let me get this straight. You have the power to become invisible.
Yes.
If someone looks at you, you immediately become visible again.
Yes.
So how do you know that you've ever been invisible?
I just know.
Look, kid, we've got a lot of heroes to interview --
I know I haven't got it entirely worked out yet, but I've always dreamed of becoming a superhero... Weren't you guys ever a kid? Didn't you ever need someone to just give you a chance?
Come on, guys -- we're fighting against evil.
Good or evil, what's the difference?
You're the Sphinx.
And you are a fool.
But now Casanova's back! And we're gonna sit around here all night eating pizza and telling stories! Hey, lets toast some marshmellows!
The wise snake coils before he strikes.
The wise snake coils before he strikes.
And a skunk stinks!
You drink too much.
When are you going to take off that mask?
When are you going to take off that mask?
When I am sure I am among friends.
Your rage is a very great power, but it blinds you to your heart.
My heart died a long time ago.
My heart died a long time ago.
It is not dead. It is hiding.
It is not dead. It is hiding.
Blow it out your bean hole, Pancho!... And to hell with the rest of you!... Look at you. Bunch of rejects. I didn't need you before -- and I don't need you now! The great ones RIDE ALONE! Adios, muchachos!
Maybe. But this isn't about living or dying. It's about good versus evil, and we're good, whether we like it or not... Maybe we look a little funny...
And smell a little funny. We're not bulletproof and we can't fly. But we're superheroes -- and that means doing what's right -- even when it's impossible... This is our city -- these are our friends, our families -- and if we don't save them, nobody will! So I say we take a ride up that hill, blast our way in there, destroy that

Now you're talking.
We're all the same really. Our songs, our dreams, our seeds are all just a brave attempt to live forever.
He is in love. His anger is gone.
Oh don't start that again --
LOOK!
Leave him alone. She's his mother, not yours.
We had an off night, that's all.
We had an off night, that's all.
So when are we gonna have an on night?
What are you talking about?
What have the famous superheroes got that we don't?
And it would be the right thing to do.
Yeah yeah -- and that, too.
I'm liking this.
I say we send out the word -- and summon all of the unsung superheroes we know!
Have you ever seen him?
How could I see him if he's invisible?
How could I see him if he's invisible?
Good point.
You sure that's how you spell it?
Yeah.
There's just not enough of us.
But we know they're out there. Hundreds -- maybe thousands of lonely, unknown superheroes, who desperately need a cause...
There's a big difference.
I used to believe that. Now I'm not so sure.
You know something? Those guys are really starting TO PISS ME OFF!
But there's still only six of us.
But there's still only six of us.
SO WHAT?
So what else has Superman got?
He's got the fact that he's Superman!
This place is built like a fortress.
Because that's what it is.
GET MAD!
But I just don't feel it.
Your Spiderman Pez dispenser!
Okay, you win. I'm pissed off. I'm seriously peeved.
But she still might call!
Are you coming or not?
Are you coming or not?
I'll drive.
I'll drive.
Not a chance!
Cover me!
With what?
He doesn't miss a trick, does he?
What a jerk -- and like nobody knows who he really is!
He's Lance Hunt! Just take off the glasses -- and it's him!
There's a vague similarity.
There's a vague similarity.
A vague similarity? IT'S THE SAME GUY!
We need a break, that's all! Nobody'd ever heard of him until he busted Casanova Frankenstein!
But look at him... and look at us.
Why do they always fill stuff these things so full you can't pull 'em out without ripping 'em!
I lost another fork tonight. She's getting suspicious, I know it.
I lost another fork tonight. She's getting suspicious, I know it.
So why don't you just tell her!
So why don't you just tell her!
I can't.
I can't.
Why not?
Why not?
Because I can't! Okay? She wouldn't understand!
Nah.
Roy, when was the last time you had an actual date?
Roy, when was the last time you had an actual date?
What does it matter? Women just want to control you -- and talk about their feelings. They want to know why you're angry all the time -- and what can they can do to help -- so you tell them there's nothing -- nothing -- just leave me alone -- but they bug you and they bug you and they bug you -- until

Who's chicken?
Maybe you should try a more romantic approach.
Like what? Cutting off my own ear?
Like what? Cutting off my own ear?
Or flowers.
Or flowers.
See ya tomorrow.
I saw him go in -- and he didn't come out!
But we don't know for sure it's the same guy.
Let's go.
Wait!... Look!
The who?
The most vicious gang of thugs this city ever produced. Twenty years ago they were Casanova's personal bodyguard. But after he was busted they crawled into the woodwork.

Well they've crawled back out.
I'm soaked. Oh great.
Shhh.
Maybe she's right.
Are you serious? This is the break we've been waiting for!
Agents?
Archenemies! Casanova isn't just a criminal -- he's a supervillain. Stopping him could be our ticket to fame, fortune -- and babes!
But there's only three of us, and he's got the entire brotherhood of evil at his disposal.
Then maybe it's time for us to form our own brotherhood... a brotherhood of righteous, crime fighting, skull cracking, Disco Boy bashing, warriors of the night!
Sounds good.
No one's sure that he actually exists, but they say he can be contacted by leaving a message on a crumpled up napkin at the Tacky Taco down by the bus station.
Maybe there was traffic.
Who are we kidding? No one's gonna show. We're living in a fantasy!
Roy, remember, it is all within your power. The only thing that's in your way... is you.
Oh shut up.
Roy --
Go dance with your mother, Jeffrey!
So where's the art?
He hasn't stolen it yet.
What's that?
Come on.
He's turned into a completely normal person!
Normal. What's normal? Does normal exist? And if it did, how would we know it?
But... only when no one is looking.
Yes.
So you're only invisible... to yourself?
No.
So you're only invisible, when absolutely no one is looking at you?
Yes.
The Obliterators!
The Eradicators!
Firepower costs money.
Anybody got any?
Yes, Obie-wan.
Hey... he's gone.
You guys going to a costume party?
We're superheroes.
We're superheroes.
Really? Like Captain Amazing?
Are you famous?
Not yet.
Not yet.
So you're like... struggling superheroes?

So what can I get you?

Burgers all around. Medium. Rare. Raw.
Here you go.
Ow.
Ow.
Maybe you guys ought to forget this Superhero stuff and join Kiwanis or something.
Jeffrey!
Oh hi, Mom.
Oh hi, Mom.
What are you doing in the silver drawer?
What are you doing in the silver drawer?
Looking for... the TV Guide.
It's on the television.
Of course. I'm such a fool... Thanks, Mummy.
Jeffrey, YOU THIEF!
Mother... it's not what you think!
Mother... it's not what you think!
And why are you wearing that silly costume?
And why are you wearing that silly costume?
Because... I'M A SUPERHERO!
Oh, Mother, I'm sorry. I know how much you wanted me to be a doctor or a lawyer with a family -- but it's just not who I am!
But... the silverware?

I use it... to fight evil.

You did?

Ever since you were a little boy... Come with me.
Oh, who gives a damn who he is? I can't take this anymore. Night after night we're on the streets, busting our humps -- and for what?
We take the licks and he gets the chicks.
We take the licks and he gets the chicks.
How long do you have to chase a dream before you realize it's not gonna happen?
Hi.
And Mister Furious... His anger is his power.
She likes you.
Definitely.

Ask her out.
This is bad.
Who are they?
Who are they?
The Disco Boys.
We may be getting in over our heads here.
This looks like a job for Superman --

Sorry.

Be a Mohican.

Shut up.
Do we have to?
I got this cousin. He's a real doofus, but he claims he can become invisible.
And there's the Sphinx.
The who?
The who?
He's a legendary masked Mexican crime fighting superwrestler and master of the machete.
And a social life.
Yeah, but how do we get to them?
To us!
Whatever our name is.
Are you sure he's still lives here?
Are you sure he's still alive?
But, Doc... where's the machine guns?
The bazookas?
Twenty years ago all the major hoodlums of this city were united into one great brotherhood of evil, and Casanova was their king.
Crime was rampant. It wasn't safe to stay in your home.
He busted Casanova and sent the crooks packing.
And this has been a pretty nice place to live ever since.
Maybe it's time we checked that place out.
But how do we get in?
That was too close.
But we gotta find out what's going on in there.
We're outnumbered twenty to one.
It's suicide.
Oh no.
Great timing!
It's time.
With or without him, we gotta go!
We've got lift off!
May the forks be with us!
Where am I going?
Through there!
Through there!
Right.
It is a thing entirely unknown in diplomacy, that one government should assume a right to dictate to another, who is upon terms of equality, the conditions on which she should conduct her commerce; and, assuming such a right, second it by threatening language, in case of non-compliance.
But, Your Majesty, the very substance of the Tilsit treaty was that you should join the Continental Blockade, boycott English goods, suspend all commercial dealings with her, and be France's ally. Nothing more is being asked than to comply with the treaty.

My dear Caulaincourt, agreements can endure only when they allow both sides to live. Napoleon may believe it is necessary to injure England but, before that, he must realize it is necessary for him to allow his friends to live. He cannot expect me to tell my nobles they must ruin themselves so that he can bring England to her knees -- and I'm

I can appreciate what Your Majesty is saying but the Emperor has staked everything on this policy. He has no other way to attack England, and no one knows more than Your Majesty how his overtures for peace have been rejected.

It's a fine thing to establish policies but, when they don't work, they must be reconsidered. Granted that you have hurt England, but she is still on her feet. And to seal off her trade with Europe, what has it cost you? You have had to rule with an iron hand. You have turned friends into enemies. And even at that, the result has

I am in no position to debate this with you, Your Majesty, but can you imagine what a blow it will be to the Emperor if you should now desert his cause? It would mean nothing less than victory for England.

My dear Caulaincourt, you have no idea of how compromised my own position has become since Tilsit. I am blamed by the army for the military disaster at Austerlitz and Friedland, by the nobility for ruining their trade with England, by the merchants who must accept French foods at unprofitable prices, and by the nation for allowing Napoleon to dictate Russian policy.
Your Majesty knows my affection for him is deep and genuine, and goes far beyond my official role as Ambassador. But I would be remiss in my feelings for you, and in my responsibility to the Emperor, if I did not say that it is entirely possible that the Emperor will view your refutation of the terms of the Treaty of Tilsit, as the
I have given a great deal of thought to that possibility, and I am prepared to face it. If it should come to war, and I presume that is what you are alluding to, I would rather have war with the Emperor than my own people.
I hope you will forgive me, Your Majesty, for requesting an audience at such a late hour, but I have traveled all the way from Moscow to see you, on a matter which cannot wait.
Very well, General, what is it you wish to say?

But, since the fire, a completely new spirit has been aroused in the nation. The French have become an army of criminals, against whom Russia must be avenged, against whom she is now prepared to fight to the death.

You know, General Kutusov, there is a very strong possibility that the fire was not started by Napoleon's troops but was organized under the orders of Rostopchin's secret police.

The point I was trying to make is that I think it is reasonable to say that Your Majesty would not find himself under unbearable pressure, if he decided to make peace with the Emperor, at least at this time.

Well, has Your Majesty considered what Napoleon's alternatives might be, if you simply chose to ignore his note?
Well, has Your Majesty considered what Napoleon's alternatives might be, if you simply chose to ignore his note?
Yes, General Kutusov, I daresay that this has been considered and discussed at great length. Napoleon would simply spend the winter in Moscow and continue the campaign in the spring. Another lesser possibility might be to march on St. Petersburg now, although there is some doubt that he has the strength to do this, until he refits his army.

You have my absolute assurance, Your Majesty, that Napoleon does not have the strength to attack St. Petersburg now -- his army is exhausted and ill-supplied, and he would be defeated if he attempted that.

Forgive me, Your Majesty, I am about to make it.
Ah, yes -- proceed.
Ah, yes -- proceed.
The point is that I don't think Napoleon will sit in Moscow until the spring! I don't think he can afford to.
Well, that is a very interesting idea, General Kutusov, but I can assure you that Napoleon is no beginner at this. Whatever analysis you have done on this situation, I am sure that he has gone over the same ground.
I have no doubt that he has, Your Majesty, but does he have any strong moves from which to choose?

Well, one thing immediately comes to mind, if what you are saying is true -- he would merely withdraw his army from Moscow and return to Poland for the winter.

Your Majesty has grasped the outlines of his problem in much less time than it took me. This is a crucial point -- and it is a political one, which Your Majesty will be in a far better position to answer than I. Can Napoleon afford to abandon Moscow without signing even the preliminaries of a peace treaty with you?

Perhaps it would be even more serious than that, Your Majesty. His European confederation is held together by some very slender threads. Your Majesty knows even better than I that Austria and Prussia are very doubtful allies, and the Emperor has reason enough to fear that they will turn on him, at the first sign of weakness.

Proceed.
If I can presume to go into the Emperor's mind, I believe that he has based his entire campaign strategy on obtaining a peace treaty after the fall of Moscow. When Vienna fell, there was a peace treaty. When Berlin fell, another treaty. That has always been the rules of the game. But what is he to do now if no treaty is forth-
What do you think Napoleon will do?
I, personally, am convinced that he will withdraw his army from Moscow, and attempt to establish himself in Poland for the winter. In the end, he will not allow himself to be cut off from Paris. But I believe that if he is offered any encouragement, by Your Majesty, he will postpone this decision as long as possible. He is a gambler and he
If he withdraws his army in good order, it will be a serious political defeat. But, if he should be caught on the move, with his army, in the full grip of winter, then it will be a catastrophe. If Your Majesty can prolong his hopes for a treaty by silence, be deceit, by any means, for another month, thus postponing his departure, then
General Kutusov, I would like to call a meeting of my cabinet tomorrow morning and have you present this idea to them. I think it has merit and is worthy of consideration.

You can always tell at a glance whether retreating infantry are being pursed by cavalry, because they hurry along and keep turning around and looking back. When they are retreating before infantry, they merely trudge along, head down.
Fascinating! Tell me, leaving aside the question of grand strategy, for the moment, what would you say is the single most difficult tactical skill to master?

Well, Belliard, what's this? What are you doing here? Where is the enemy?
They are at the gates of Paris, sire.

The Empress, your son and the whole court left two days ago for Rambouillet. Marshals Mortier and Marmont are probably still in Paris, completing the arrangements.
But, sire, Your Majesty would lay Paris open to being sacked. The enemy is outside the gates with more than 120,000 men. Besides this, I left the city under the terms of a treaty and I am forbidden to reenter Paris.
A treaty? Don't be ridiculous. What treaty is this? Who made it? Who has been giving orders?

What cowardice! What treason! Joseph has ruined everything. How could they all lose their heads. They knew I was coming up fast. Victory was just within grasp. Come, come, turn your troops around, General Belliard.
Josephine dead -- how unbelievable! How impossible it is to believe it. She was always physically so strong -- she was never ill a day in her life.
It is a terrible shock.
But did she have the best doctors? Wasn't there any chance at all to save her?
I don't know, sire -- she had the Tsar's personal physician.
I don't know, sire -- she had the Tsar's personal physician.
She should have had Larrey or Corvisart. They might have saved her... But why didn't anyone even write to me? Can you believe that no one even bothered to write to me? Would you have believed that I should read such news in a newspaper? How incredible!

Ah, my poor Josephine. She was the most alluring, most glamorous creature I have ever known -- a woman in every sense of the word, and she had the kindest heart in the world.

I suppose I might blame her for opening her house to the men most responsible to my downfall, but how can I? She was on her own again, she had to look after her own affairs, and how can one blame her for having her head turned by the attention of Kings?
Who is there?
Bertrand, sire.

I have just had the most vivid... dream... about Josephine.

She was sitting there... and it was as if I had last seen her only the night before... She hadn't changed -- she was still the same -- still completely devoted to me... and she told me we were going to see each other again and, never again, leave each other... She has promised me. Did you see her?

This dispatch has just arrived from Aboukir, marked highest priority, for General Bonaparte's eyes only.
Let me see it.
I believe you are acquainted with my brother, Joseph Bonaparte, and my aide, Major Junot.
Yes, sir, I had the honor of meeting them on the trip from Paris.
Captain Charles, I believe you are one of General Le Clerc's aides-de- camp.
Yes, sir, I am.

You will return to Paris tomorrow and you will carry my compliments and thanks to General Le Clerc for assigning such an excellent officer to carry out a responsibility which has meant so much to myself and to Madame Bonaparte.

Ah-hh, no.

I thought not. I noticed you by yourself, all night.
Just a minute, General. Listen, don't let them fool you with all their grand la-de-da. They've all made their money from the war -- mostly from crooked war contracts. They say Citizen Barras has put away millions.
I see...

The Emperor has decided to marry your Archduchess, Marie-Louise.
What is that?

Earlier this afternoon, the Emperor refused the hand of the Grand Duchess Anna, of Russia, and, as I'm sure you can appreciate, he is quite able to change his mind again. For the Emperor, to choose a wife, is only a matter of minutes.

May I suggest that we can prepare and sign the agreement, between ourselves, subject to the approval of the two Emperors. Believe me, my dear friend, your Archduchess, Marie-Louis, may very well hold, in her hands, the future of our two countries.

Francis, may I ask whether you wear warm winter underwear?
No -- not as a rule.
Ah, well, that is the first rule of warfare. You must wear long-sleeved and long-legged underwear. You can never conjure up brilliancies with a cold bottom.
Good evening, sir.

The weather is terrible, isn't it, sir?
Yes, it is. It must be one of the worst nights we have had this winter.

To Citizen General Bonaparte from one who does not wish to see him dishonored by his wife. You should know, Citizen General, that your wife has taken a lover, one Captain Hippolyte Charles... undated and unsigned.
Naturally, one does not take much stock in such a piece of filth but, on the other hand, it is not the sort of thing one can simply ignore. What do you think, Joseph?
No...
No...
Junot?
No... nothing at all.
Not even the slightest hint of something?

No -- Captain Charles commanded the cavalry escort, and rode outside the carriage. In the evenings, he always ate at another table. They hardly ever spoke to each other.

Are you sure that you are not still in love with her?
Are you trying to insult me?

Of course not, but such violence of feeling makes me wonder.

My dear Joseph, the only thing that is clear is that my wife is a slut -- and while a man may want a slut for his mistress, he does not want her for his wife.
Will you use the troops?
Only as a last resort. What are the Councils doing now?
Ah, my dear Madame de Montesquiou, you have no idea what happiness it brings me to see this child, at last. I was told the very idea of such a visit would too much distress the Empress.
I am delighted to be of service to you again, Your Highness. And I can tell you, my instructions came directly from the Emperor, with a caution to be discreet.

Ah, how nice to meet you, General Bonaparte. One has read so much about you lately. Please sit down.
Thank you, Madame de Beauharnais. You probably don't recall but we met briefly a few months ago, at a party at Paul's house.

You are very kind, Madame de Beauharnais. Do you have some sherry, perhaps?
Yes, of course. Hortense, darling, will you tell Louise to bring some sherry?
I hope you will forgive me for barging in on you like this, Madame de Beauharnais. I called to bring this to your son, but I understand from your charming daughter that he is out for the afternoon.
Yes, I'm afraid he is. I believe he is riding. I know he'll be heartbroken to have missed you.
Yes, I'm afraid he is. I believe he is riding. I know he'll be heartbroken to have missed you.
Well, I'm sure that you will be just as pleased to have this as he will be.
Oh... how very nice of you to bring that for Eugene... Did General de Beauharnais give it to you?
No, I'm afraid I never had the pleasure of meeting the General. This sword was taken several days ago from your son by some of my soldiers.
No, I'm afraid I never had the pleasure of meeting the General. This sword was taken several days ago from your son by some of my soldiers.
Oh, you must forgive me, General Bonaparte, I'm afraid you will think me incredibly stupid but I know absolutely nothing about this. Eugene is so independent -- he hardly tells me anything any more, and he has so many things in his room, I must confess I wasn't even aware that he had this sword -- you know how boys can be!
Were you in love with him?

Not in the least. After all, what is adultery -- only a brief transaction on a couch, requiring a few minutes of privacy.

In case of a... surprise attack... at night... I am such a... light sleeper... I could wake you... I could scream.
Who is it?
It's me.
I didn't mean the things that I said... I was angry and I said more than I meant to.
Oh, my darling. I'm sorry, too. I won't do that again -- whatever you do. I won't cause you any more embarrassment, I promise.
Oh -- I didn't tell you... I've seen Dr. Corvisart, and he was very reassuring and encouraging. He has had excellent results with the waters of Plombiers, and he thinks it would be a good idea for me to spend a few weeks there. Apparently, he sent Madame Le Floch there last year, and she gave birth to twins.
Indeed -- well, you may tell Dr. Corvisart, I should be entirely satisfied with half her success.
No, one cannot simply ignore it.
I am afraid, then, I have to ask you both, Joseph as my brother, and Junot as my good friend, whether or not you know anything about this, or whether you saw anything at all during the trip which might make you suspect some truth to it.
I believe you sent for me.
Yes, yes, please sit down. I will be with you in a moment.
God damn it, Junot, wouldn't you think I have enough things on my mind not to waste time on a letter like this to Joseph?
There's probably some explanation.
There's probably some explanation.
Yes, I'm sure he's been too busy chasing his whores to be bothered about my wife.
Well, anyway, sorry to call you away from the festivities, but where is the breakdown on serviceable vehicles? I asked for it yesterday.
I gave it to Berthier... this afternoon.

He's downstairs -- somewhere.

All right, thank you. Please ask him to come here.
Yes... but, first, can I say something to you, as a friend?
Certainly.
Certainly.
I know that I shouldn't butt into things... that are really no concern of mine... but you shouldn't write a letter like that to Joseph.

Now, just a minute. You have just very clearly implied that there is a reason why Joseph should not give my wife the money which I left for her. I can't possibly allow a remark like that to go without explanation.

There are some things... better left unsaid.

I was in her maid's room at an inn we stopped at for the night, outside of Dijon. It was an adjoining room to Madame Bonaparte's.
Yes?
You could hear them?
Yes.
You mean you heard them making love?
Yes.
How did you know it was Captain Charles?
I questioned the maid, and she admitted Charles had been Madame Bonaparte's lover for several months.

Can you give me a drink, please?
Can you give me a drink, please?
Yes, of course. What do you want?
I wanted to kill him but Joseph convinced me it would be a mistake. He said people would say you hadn't the courage to deal with it yourself.
And was it so widely known that Joseph had reason for such concern?
And was it so widely known that Joseph had reason for such concern?

Good evening, ladies. You must forgive me, my dearest wife, but I simply could not wait to see you.
Oh, then you are...
Oh, then you are...
Yes, my dearest Marie-Louise, I am your husband.
And, where did you see my portrait?
Ah, you must forgive me, my dearest Marie-Louise, I saw it during one of my stays at your palace -- at Schonbrunn.
And, you, my dear wife, do you find that I resemble my portraits?
You are much younger, and much more handsome, than your pictures.
Do you like music?
Yes, I do -- very much.

Oh, no, I am very happy. But you must have patience with me... I know nothing at all of what a wife must know. And I know nothing about men. My papa has never allowed me even to have a pet of the male gender.

No.
No.

Yes, he has.
Now, the section headed "Secret Clauses of the Treaty" -- Article 14b, provides for Alexander to serve as mediator between France and England and, if he fails to achieve a preliminary agreement within four months, it further provides that Russia is to go to war against England, and close her ports to English trade.
That is correct.
That is correct.
Do you think Alexander has any chance to succeed as a mediator?

I very seriously doubt it. I don't think there is any possibility of making peace with England so long as she sees herself safe from invasion. That is why we must increase the pressure on her economy. With Russia in the Continental Blockade, England must collapse. More than 40% of her trade is with the Continent and Russia.

My dear Talleyrand, none of the Kings of Europe bear any friendship for France. It is easy for you to talk of reliable treaties. The only treaties you have been able to negotiate are the ones I have won on the battlefield.

I hope that understanding is worth as much as you think it is, sire.

Very well, Citizen Lieutenant. You have come to the right place, for I am Citizen Varlac.
A revolution is not a polite discussion in a parlor, Citizen Lieutenant. One does not call it murder to kill such vermin.
You may save your philosophy for the magistrate, Monsieur Varlac. I am only a simple officer in the army, and to me what you have done is called murder, and his always been called murder by honest men.

No, Monsieur Varlac, my warrant is only for you. Now, will you please come down at once. You will be taken back to Chalon for trial.
Citizen Lieutenant, my advice is to leave this town at once with your men. We do not wish to do harm to our brothers in uniform.
Monsieur Varlac, do not pretend to speak for these good people whom you have misled and inflamed with violent speech. Now, I order you to come down from the cart.
I suggest that you leave with your men while you can.
Monsieur Varlac, I will count slowly to five, and if you have not begun to get down from the cart by then, I will carry out your execution, on the spot.

Napoleon was born at Ajaccio in Corsica on August 15th, 1769. He had not been a healthy baby and his mother, Letizia, lavished him with care and devotion. In middle age, he would write about her from St. Helena.
My mother has always loved me. She would do anything for me.
His moods at this time were complex and varied.
Life is a burden for me. Nothing gives me any pleasure; I find only sadness in everything around me. It is very difficult because the ways of those with whom I live, and probably always shall live, are as different from mine as moonlight is from sunlight.
He made friends with a family called Columbier, and would later write of his first flirtation with their daughter, Caroline.
It will scarcely be considered credible, perhaps, but our whole business consisted in eating cherries together.
Napoleon would soon arouse the resentment of the Directory in Paris, exceeding his authority, making political decisions and treaties like a Roman Conqueror, enlarging his role to ruler of Italy. Only his tremendous success and ever increasing popularity prevented the Directory from replacing him.
From that moment on, I foresaw what I might be. Already I felt the earth flee beneath me, as if I were being carried away up to the sky.
On December 2, 1804, Napoleon was made Emperor of France. He would later say: "I found the crown lying in the gutter and I picked it up."
Duroc, I have a bill here for 600,000 francs from Tirot, for building the Imperial throne and six decorated arm-chairs. The amount is absurd -- and, at least twice too much.
Led by the warlike Queen Louisa, and her fashion-minded husband, King Frederich Wilhelm, the Prussians still believed themselves cast in the mold of Frederick the Great, and more than a match for Napoleon. The King had a special collection of 60 splendid uniforms, and was personally involved in the design of all the Prussian army uniforms.
If the French army had been commanded at Jena and Auerstadt by a tailor, the King of Prussia would certainly have gained the day.
I know Alexander. His imagination must be struck by some great, bold, powerful stroke, and he will come back to me, just as he did at Friedland.
With his army of 400,000 men in concealed bivouacs, on a ten mile front, in the forests, bordering the banks of the Vistula river, Napoleon conducted a last minute personal reconnaissance, disguised in the uniform of a Polish lancer.
On January 1st, 1814, France itself was invaded. Now, with a small army of raw recruits, Napoleon would have to face the powerful combination of England, Russia, Prussia and Austria, operating against him together, for the first time. The balance of numbers had tilted irretrievably against him.
A year ago, the whole of Europe was marching alongside of us. Today, the whole of Europe is marching against us.
Okay, I know what I want this time.
Anything you need.
Anything you need.
Yo' cousin, Craig. Hook us up.

Uncle Elroy, who's that girl by Day-Day's car?
Yeah, you gotta have a little money to live out here, Craig. I never thought I'd be the kinda nigga to move to the suburbs. But as soon as I got my check, I was gone. Paid 230 thousand dollars cash on this house.
You paid cash?
You paid cash?
Cash money. They wasn't gonna stick me with no 30-year payment plan. That's for suckas. They got my daddy like that for a Cadillac years ago. I got the only house on the block that's paid for. That's why I'm the king around here.
It's cool, but where's the water?
Don't need water. We didn't have no pool in the projects...so none of us swim.

I don't know, I think I passed out or something. I don't remember.
Passed out? Can't hang, huh? Boy, I knew you was a lightweight. Passed out on one funky ass blunt. They don't make 'em like they used to, baby.
No. Thought he was with you.
Daddy, Uncle Elroy, I need your help.
Me, too. You think they're in there?
Yup.
That's a nice piece of heat right there.
Thank you. I only got two bullets in the mothafucka, but it's better than nothing.
Stretch it out.
Don't move me.
Who are you?
I'm his cousin.
We didn't come here for Day-Day.
Yes you did.

Whatever you say, man. I didn't see shit. The safe combination is 34-5-27. Just take it all.
What's crackin'?
You. Hi, Uncle Willie.
You know it's been over a year since we kicked it last? Up at the family reunion.
I know, that's when Uncle Elroy cussed out everybody, and threw up in Aunt Faye's backseat.
Yep. I forgot about him cussin' out everybody. Damn that was fun.
I know, we had a good time. But ever since you guys moved out here, it seems like we've lost touch.
I know, we had a good time. But ever since you guys moved out here, it seems like we've lost touch.
I know; this a long way from Watts. But what I like about living out here is that you don't hear no helicopters, no sirens, no drive-by's, no nothing. Just peace and quiet. Listen.

Why?
Why?
Because, it's been a little tension between us ever since they got out the joint and ran their momma crazy. And I'm just trying to keep the peace. We moved out here to get away from that shit.
So.

If you 'get into it' with them S.A.'s and start a feud, you can always go back to home. I gotta live here. Just remember that.

Okay, plan B.

It works.
Still gonna smell it.
This vacuum don't work. Where's the restroom?
Out the door and to the left.
Craig, what the hell are you doing?
Nothing.
What we gonna do?
I don't know yet.
Alright, Roach, see you around.

You see that?

I don't know, and it could be anything. But I just say we go take a look.
Man, I don't think I can do this, Craig. I got the B-G's.
What's the B-G's?
What's the B-G's?
The bubble guts. I'm so nervous it feels like I'mma shit on myself.
You make it sound so easy.
It is easy. You know why? 'Cause they're not expecting it. Now, Roach, you gotta occupy Cheeco. Long enough for me and Day-Day to take a good look.
You go first.
Naw, you go first.
Naw, you go first.
You go first.
You go first.
No.

Day-Day, if you don't hop that fence I'mma throw you over.
