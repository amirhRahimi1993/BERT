Tom, you okay?
Hardly anyone calls me Tom. Everybody calls me Mack. I always liked that.

Yeah, of course.
Yeah, of course.
What's going on?
It's quite advanced.
Burn marks. The original M.E. listed it as "burn residue." Same place, the outer thigh, as Karen Sumpter. The UNSUB is able to abduct, kill, transport and bury without detection.

All the same killer?

Low calls him Suspect Zero.

Suspect Zero is a crackpot theory. You said so.

That's what Koessler wants us to believe. To discredit Low.

You're assigned, we're assigned, to apprehend Richard Low, not Suspect Zero. I have to tell you, Mack, I'm not comfortable where you're going.

But it was your idea: "use Zero," you said, use Zero to get Low.
I haven't changed anything. Damn.
I...
I...
I've got to take a piss.

It's a truck. A refrigerated truck.
It's a truck. A refrigerated truck.
Zero abducts victims all over the country, kills them, keeps them refrigerated for days, weeks, even months, then buries them hundreds, thousands of miles away. Karen Sumpter was buried, washed up in a flood. Evans was buried. When we get Zero, we'll find boneyards all across the country.

How are we going to find him?
How are we going to find him?
Get the routes of all refrigerated trucks over the last ten years. We've got three disappearance cities and dates, three parallel discovery cities. Get into the mainframe, let it crunch this information.
What happened?
I'm going to Amarillo.
Agent...
Kulok.
Kulok.
Agent Kulok, could you wipe my face?
Unlock these cuffs.
Sit back.
Mack must think Zero has a police band.
Of course he does. Now get the key, get these things off me. Unhook me.
Uncuff me. What's wrong with you? Don't you want to save the boy?
I want to protect the boy. I also want to protect Suspect Zero -- from you.
Okay, I'll unhook you. No weapon.
No weapon.
No weapon.
Turn around. Stretch your arms over the seat.
Bitch! Cunt! Please, please, please don't do this, Agent Kulok. You need me.
I'll be back.
How did you know Speck was a killer?
The little piggie speaks.
Who are you?
I'll give you a little hint. You're a smart guy, figure it out.
Agent Mackelway?
Yes.
Yes.
This is Richard Low. Stay on the phone. Do not disconnect. I'm watching you. I will instruct you where to drive.
This is Richard Low. Stay on the phone. Do not disconnect. I'm watching you. I will instruct you where to drive.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
When you exit, head east on 10th.
Dave Koessler must have you jumping through hoops.
I believe it is you, sir, who has us jumping through hoops.

I've been reading, hearing about you. I spoke to Koessler, Professor Daitz.

He couldn't break an egg with a hammer. He still writing those crime porn books?

He's moved on to TV.
He's moved on to TV.
He always had a weakness in that area. I saw it the first time I met him. We all had our weaknesses, I guess. Daitz wanted the money. With Dave it was the glory. Koessler saw the Behavioral Sciences Unit as a stepping stone to bigger and better bureaucratic things. He had his eye on the Director's job, even then. Catching killers was a
What was your weakness, sir?
I'm not sure, exactly. I had monsters on the brain. I wanted to get these guys, every one of them. I got obsessive.

Suspect Zero?
Suspect Zero?
Deputy Director Koessler opposed the theory because it meant pressing the legal envelope, risking high-profile failure. Better to get rid of me. Then he could be Mr. Serial Killer, Mr. Authority on Deviant Behavior -- no embarrassing questions about the contribution of one Richard Low. Do you really think that plane crashed by accident? Do you really think I wasn't on it by accident?

Was I afraid of Dave Koessler? Not likely. I told you, I'd gotten a bit obsessive. It was an opportunity to back off, think things through. Where's the file?

You're a smart guy. Tell me what it says.
You're a smart guy. Tell me what it says.
"Agent Low's theory of Suspect Zero, the undetected serial killer, is delusional, the product of good intentions, paranoia and obsession..."
Hum a tune and I'll sing to it.
The file, however, was kept open after your death. NPE disappearances, No Plausible Explanation, were sometimes filed there, deleted if the bodies were found.
It's my master list of missing persons: men, boys, girls, children over the last ten years. Two hundred and eighty-five names. A pool of possible victims.
Zero killed them all?
Zero killed them all?
Of course not. They're possibles. I've checked them against Bureau records, check them against your file. How did you get it?
Of course not. They're possibles. I've checked them against Bureau records, check them against your file. How did you get it?
Daitz hinted it existed. It was a matter of forming the request in the proper terms.
After my hiatus, after I got my priorities readjusted, I drifted online, started tracking porn chat rooms, looking for Zero. Got accepted, came across these boys swapping stories, pictures, downloads. Never found Zero, but I did come across some Class A scumbags.
How do you know who's real and who's not?
How do you know who's real and who's not?
And who else did I find? Agent Thomas Mackelway, crackerjack FBI techie. I was greatly disappointed when you were re-assigned.

Please. You can't hide from me, sonny. I invented the questionnaire. I can tell those who talk from those who do it in the time it takes you to fart.
There's someone out there, Mack, I know, some man killing for the fun of it, sniffing human glue, without regard to age or sex, without predicable M.O. Someone who has a way to dispose of the bodies. You have access, you can call up local authorities, check morgues, conduct interviews. Be my man.
I already have an employer.

Maybe you should back off.

This guy, Zero, he drifts around, that's how they all start, drifting around, their minds filling up with fantasies. He thinks he's real smart, laughs at us, laughs at his victims. But he has left a trail, and the trail is somewhere in those names. You know how to reach me. Take my advice, when dealing with these FBI tight-asses, go by the book.

The boy's okay. I saw him...
Was it Zero?
Yeah.

Lionheart here. I'm back. Sorry about the absence. I had to do some therapy at the crossbar hotel.
[Reality very risky.]
Whatever happened to MyDick?

Something came up, Murman, my man.
[You want to talk, Lionheart, or you want to take this a little more personal?]
Lead the way, Murman.
Lead the way, Murman.

[If you wanted a good steak, you should have gone to Omaha.]
Let's go someplace private, Murman, I have something for you.
Let's talk about Zero.
[Hello, Agent Mackelway. How's the watch? Maybe you can do one of those TV commercials, I found my watch under a serial killer's heart and it was still ticking.]

I've located the Suspect Zero file. Did you know there was one? Koessler ordered it as part of your evaluation.
[Don't jerk a jerk-off. There's nothing in the Bureau mainframe.]
[Don't jerk a jerk-off. There's nothing in the Bureau mainframe.]
Not everything is imputed to memory. The most confidential stuff is kept top secret hard copy. Why would the Zero file be kept secret?

This is a first. You criticized the Deputy Director to his face and you still have a badge? You must have some one-of-a-kind skills. Why don't you just quit? I mean, you're not going to get promoted, not wearing this jacket.

Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Got a vehicle? Head north on 54. When you get to New Mexico you've gone too far.
Headed there now. The same shift will be on at noon.

Eight, nine months ago. When I was at Computer Crime. I got into a chat room with someone named MyDick. I'd talked to him before. Everything I saw yesterday, everything in the autopsies, it's identical. The forensics are dead on.

But why attack an Agent?
He wants us to know he's out there, what he's doing. It's not enough just to kill somebody like Speck, he wants us to know he did it.
How far is Amarillo?

Now, Mr. Hawkins, when last in Amarillo, where did you get gas?

Excuse me, Agent Mackelway?

Perhaps you can explain it to him. It's Agent Mackelway.
I'm Agent Thomas Mackelway, FBI. There is no way you will escape. Assistant Deputy Director Richard Low is en route with another Agent. You may know Low by another name. You may know him by the name Murman. I am Lionheart.
Murman!
Murman!
He's a brilliant man. Brilliant enough to catch you.
He's a brilliant man. Brilliant enough to catch you.
Brilliant? You think he caught any of them because he was brilliant? Hardboy? MyDick? Imelda? Ripper? Think about it, how did he locate them? He found them as Murman. And how did Murder Man find them? With sweet talk and brains? No. He did it with souvenirs. He took them into private rooms, swapped goodies: pictures, panties, jewelry, body parts. Snuff downloads. As bait.
You want to "profile" me? Find out what makes me "tick"? Write about me, go on a talk show, give me a nickname?
It's over for you.

They were auditioning for the same role as you?

Wait... Wait... Listen... So, I check the time and place. I'm where I'm supposed to be. I call my agent... She says they asked for me specifically...
It's like, you looked at my tape. You saw my picture. Why did you call me in? You knew I was twenty-four.
What an asshole.
Let me just check on my boy.
Don't worry. He's in good hands.
Always...
No matter what... like splitting aces.
Lisa works at the MGM Grand...

...Well, then, I guess we don't have to worry about him anymore.
Our little baby's growing up...
...One fifty-nine, Two minutes.
Two vodka martinis, straight up, shaken not stirred, very dry, easy on the water.

Beautiful. What time are you off... ...Christy?
Beautiful. What time are you off... ...Christy?
Six.
And you?
I'll have the Blackbeard over easy.
I'll have the Blackbeard over easy.
I'll be back with the coffee.
Yes, I understand. I'm listening.
You owe the Don a service. In one hour, not before, perhaps later, he will be at your funeral parlor to ask for your help. Be there to greet him. If you have any objections speak now, and I'll inform him.
Anything...Anything the Godfather wishes.
Good. He never doubted you.
Good. He never doubted you.
The Don himself is coming to me tonight?
The Don himself is coming to me tonight?
Yes.
This is Tom Hagen; I'm calling for Don Corleone, at his request.
Yes, I understand I'm listening.
Yes, I understand I'm listening.
You owe the Don a service. He has no doubt that you will repay it.
Bonasera, we know each other for years, but this is the first time you come to me for help. I don't remember the last time you invited me to your house for coffee...even though our wives are friends.
What do you want of me? I'll give you anything you want, but do what I ask!
What do you want of me? I'll give you anything you want, but do what I ask!
And what is that Bonasera?
No. You ask for too much.
I ask for Justice.
I ask for Justice.
The Court gave you justice.
The Court gave you justice.
An eye for an eye!
An eye for an eye!
But your daughter is still alive.
But your daughter is still alive.
Then make them suffer as she suffers. How much shall I pay you.
You never think to protect yourself with real friends. You think it's enough to be an American. All right, the Police protects you, there are Courts of Law, so you don't need a friend like me. But now you come to me and say Don Corleone, you must give me justice. And you don't ask in respect or friendship. And you don't think to
America has been good to me...
America has been good to me...
Then take the justice from the judge, the bitter with the sweet, Bonasera. But if you come to me with your friendship, your loyalty, then your enemies become my enemies, and then, believe me, they would fear you...
Be my friend.
Good. From me you'll get Justice.
Good. From me you'll get Justice.
Godfather.
Godfather.
Some day, and that day may never come, I would like to call upon you to do me a service in return.
What do you wish me to do?
I want you to use all your powers, all your skill, as you love me. I do not want his mother to see him as he is.
Understood. I just wish I was doing more to help out.
I'll come to you when I need you.
Jesus, Connie...Sure, Mike...
Go back to your house and wait for me...
Godfather!
You have to answer for Santino.
You fingered Sonny for the Barzini people. That little farce you played out with my sister. Did Barzini kid you that would fool a Corleone?
I swear I'm innocent. I swear on the head of my children, I'm innocent. Mike, don't do this to me, please Mike, don't do this to me!
I swear I'm innocent. I swear on the head of my children, I'm innocent. Mike, don't do this to me, please Mike, don't do this to me!
Barzini is dead. So is Philip Tattaglia, so are Strachi, Cuneo and Moe Greene...I want to square all the family accounts tonight. So don't tell me you're innocent; admit what you did.
Don't be frightened. Do you think I'd make my sister a widow? Do you think I'd make your children fatherless? After all, I'm Godfather to your son. No, your punishment is that you're out of the family business. I'm putting you on a plane to Vegas--and I want you to stay there. I'll send Connie an allowance, that's all. But don't keep saying you're
Barzini.
Barzini.
Good, good. Leave now; there's a car waiting to take you to the airport.
What's the matter, Carlo?
Shut up.
What was that?
Your girl friend. She says she can't make it tonight. You lousy bastard you have the nerve to give your whores my telephone number. I'll kill you, you bastard!
You're staying home. You're not going out.
OK, OK. You gonna make me something to eat at least?
The food is on the table.
I'm not hungry yet.
I'm not hungry yet.
Eat it, it's on the table.
Eat it, it's on the table.
Ba Fa Goulle.
Ba Fa Goulle.
BA FA GOULE YOU!
You filthy guinea spoiled brat. Clean it up or I'll kick your head in.
Like hell I will.
You heard about your father?
Yeah.
Yeah.
The word is out in the streets that he's dead.

Where the hell was Paulie, why wasn't he with the Don?

Paulie's been a little sick all winter...he was home.
Paulie's been a little sick all winter...he was home.
How many times did he stay home the last couple of months?
How many times did he stay home the last couple of months?
Maybe three, four times. I always asked Freddie if he wanted another bodyguard, but he said no. Things have been so smooth the last ten years...

Go get Paulie, I don't care how sick he is. Pick him up yourself, and bring him to my father's house.

That's all? Don't you want me to send some people over here?
That's all? Don't you want me to send some people over here?
No, just you and Paulie.
Clemenza. You take care of Paulie. I don't ever want to see him again. Understood?
Understood.
Understood.
Okay, now you can move your men into the Mall, replace Tessio's people. Mike, tomorrow you take a couple of Clemenza's people and go to Luca's apartment and wait for him to show. That crazy bastard might be going after Sollozzo right now if he's heard the news.
You take care of Paulie?
You won't see Paulie anymore. He's sick for good this winter.
Sollozzo knows Mike's a civilian.
OK, but be careful.
I want somebody very good, very safe to plant that gun. I don't want my brother coming out of that toilet with just his dick in his hand.
The gun will be there.
The gun will be there.
You're on, kid...I'll square it with Mom your not seeing her before you left. And I'll get a message to your girl friend when I think the time is right.
You're on, kid...I'll square it with Mom your not seeing her before you left. And I'll get a message to your girl friend when I think the time is right.
We gotta move...
Mostly it gives witnesses an excuse to change their identification when we make them see the light. Then you take a long vacation and we catch the hell.
How bad will it be?
How bad will it be?
Probably all the other families will line up against us. But, it's alright. These things have to happen once every ten years or so...gets rid of the bad blood. You gotta stop 'em at the beginning. Like they shoulda stopped Hitler at Munich, they shoulda never let him get away with that, they were just asking for big trouble...
We gotta fight sometime. Let us at least recruit our regimes to full strength.
No, I don't want to give Barzini an excuse to start fighting.
He's going to be our lawyer in Vegas. Nobody goes to him with any other business as of now, this minute. No reflection on Tom; that's the way I want it. Besides, if I ever need any advice, who's a better Consigliere than my father.
Then in a six month time we're on our own; is that it?
Then in a six month time we're on our own; is that it?
Maybe less...
You look terrif on the floor!
What are you, a dance judge? Go do your job; take a walk around the neighborhood... see everything is okay.
I tol' you to stay put, Paulie...
The guy at the gate's outside...says there's a package...
Outside.
Sure.
I'll think about it.
Drive while you thinking; I wanna get to the City this month!
Good for ten men...
OK, go to Arthur Avenue; I'm suppose to call when I found somethin'.
You think we'll go for that last place?
Maybe, or you gotta know now.
Maybe, or you gotta know now.
Holy cow, I don't gotta know nothing.
My business is heroin, I have poppy fields, laboratories in Narseilles and Sicily, ready to go into production. My importing methods are as safe as these things can be, about five per cent loss. The risk is nothing, the profits enormous.
Why do you come to me? Why do I deserve your generosity?
Why do you come to me? Why do I deserve your generosity?
I need two million dollars in cash...more important, I need a friend who has people in high places; a friend who can guarantee that if one of my employees be arrested, they would get only light sentences. Be my friend.

What percentages for my family?
What percentages for my family?
Thirty per cent. In the first year your share would be four million dollars; then it would go up.
Thirty per cent. In the first year your share would be four million dollars; then it would go up.
And what is the percentage of the Tattaglia family?
My compliments. I'll take care of them from my share.
So. I receive 30 per cent just for finance and legal protection. No worries about operations, is that what you tell me?
So. I receive 30 per cent just for finance and legal protection. No worries about operations, is that what you tell me?
If you think two million dollars in cash is just finance, I congratulate you Don Corleone.
No...how a man makes his living is none of my business. But this proposition of yours is too risky. All the people in my family lived well the last ten years, I won't risk that out of greed.
Are you worried about security for your million?
Are you worried about security for your million?
No.
No.
The Tattaglias will guarantee your investment also.
I kept trying to call you after my divorce and Tom always said you were busy. When I got the Wedding invitation I knew you weren't sore at me anymore, Godfather.
Can I do something for you still? You're not too rich, or too famous that I can't help you?
Can I do something for you still? You're not too rich, or too famous that I can't help you?
I'm not rich anymore, Godfather, and...my career, I'm almost washed up...
All right, Hollywood...Now tell me about this Hollywood Pezzonovanta who won't let you work.
He owns the studio. Just a month ago he bought the movie rights to this book, a best seller. And the main character is a guy just like me. I wouldn't even have to act, just be myself.
You take care of your family?
Sure.
You look terrible. I want you to eat well, to rest. And spend time with your family. And then, at the end of the month, this big shot will give you the part you want.
It's too late. All the contracts have been signed, they're almost ready to shoot.
It's too late. All the contracts have been signed, they're almost ready to shoot.
I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.
Is it necessary?
You understand him better than anyone.
I'm sure it's the most generous gift today.
The Senator called--apologized for not coming personally, but said you'd understand. Also, some of the Judges...they've all sent gifts. And another call from Virgil Sollozzo.
He's his own boss, and very competent.
And with prison record.
And with prison record.
Two terms; one in Italy, one in the United States. He's known to the Government as a top narcotics man. That could be a plus for us; he could never get immunity to testify.

When did he call?
When did he call?
This morning.
This morning.
On a day like this. Consiglero, do you also have in your notes the the Turk made his living from Prostitution before the war, like the Tattaglias do now. Write that down before you forget it. The Turk will wait.
It is Johnny. He came all the way from California to be at the wedding.
Should I bring him in.
Should I bring him in.
No. Let the people enjoy him. You see? He is a good godson.
No. Let the people enjoy him. You see? He is a good godson.
It's been two years. He's probably in trouble again.
When does my daughter leave with her bridegroom?
They'll cut the cake in a few minutes...leave right after that. Your new son-in-law, do we give him something important?
They'll cut the cake in a few minutes...leave right after that. Your new son-in-law, do we give him something important?
No, give him a living. But never let him know the family's business. What else, Tom?
No, give him a living. But never let him know the family's business. What else, Tom?
I've called the hospital; they've notified Consiglere Genco's family to come and wait. He won't last out the night.
What is this nonsense?
It's from Johnny. It was announced this morning. He's going to play the lead in the new Woltz Brothers film.
My wife was weeping before she fell asleep, outside my window I saw my caporegimes to the house, and it is midnight. So, Consigliere of mine, I think you should tell your Don what everyone knows.
I didn't tell Mama anything. I was about to come up and wake you and tell you. Just now.
I didn't tell Mama anything. I was about to come up and wake you and tell you. Just now.
But you needed a drink first.
But you needed a drink first.
Yes.
Yes.
Now you've had your drink.
When I meet with Tattaglia's people; should I insist that all his drug middle-men be clean?
Mention it, don't insist. Barzini is a man who will know that without being told.

You mean Tattaglia.

Barzini.
Barzini.
He was the one behind Sollozzo?
He was the one behind Sollozzo?
Tattaglia is a pimp. He could never have outfought Santino. But I wasn't sure until this day. No, it was Barzini all along.
Tom, I never thought you were a bad Consigliere, I thought Santino a bad Don, rest in peace. He had a good heart but he wasn't the right man to head the family when I had my misfortune. Michael has all my confidence, as you do. For reasons which you can't know, you must have no part in what will happen.
Maybe I can help.
Will your girl friend get back to the city all right?
Tom said he'd take care of it.
What was this for?
For bravery.

And this?

Have you thought about a wife? A family?
No.
No.
I understand, Michael. But you must make a family, you know.

I could accept everything that's happened; I could accept it, but that I never had a choice. From the time I was born, you had laid this all out for me.

Then why have I become a man like you?
Then why have I become a man like you?
You are like me, we refuse to be fools, to be puppets dancing on a string pulled by other men. I hoped the time for guns and killing and massacres was over. That was my misfortune. That was your misfortune. I was hunted on the streets of Corleone when I was twelve years old because of who my father was. I had no choice.

How did you find out?
I see you have your Luca Brasi.
I'll need him.
I'll need him.
There are men in this world who demand to be killed. They argue in gambling games; they jump out of their cars in a rage if someone so much as scratches their fender. These people wander through the streets calling out "Kill me, kill me." Luca Brasi was like that. And since he wasn't scared of death, and in fact, looked for it...I made
Barzini will move against you first.
How?
How?
He will get in touch with you through someone you absolutely trust. That person will arrange a meeting, guarantee your safety...
Your wife and children...you're happy with them?
Yes.
Yes.
Good.

Michael, why must you do this. We have been lucky so far, all these months you've been here we've kept your name a secret. It is from love for your father that I've asked you never to more than an hour from the Villa.

That is your birthright...but Michael, use this car.
No...I would like to walk to Corleone.
Things went badly in Palermo?
The younger men have no respect. Things are changing; I don't know what will happen. Michael, because of the wedding, people now know your name.

It's the real Thunderbolt, then.
Come Sunday morning: My name is Vitelli and my house is up there on the hill, above the village.
Why didn't Moe Green meet us at the airport?
He had business at the hotel, but he'll drop in for dinner.
You look wonderful, kid; really wonderful. That doctor did some job on your face.
You look good, too.
Ever seen anything like that before?
No.
Mike! The party starting!
Come here a minute, Fredo.
Who are those girls?
That's for you to find out.
That's for you to find out.
Give them some money and send them home.
Give them some money and send them home.
Mike!
Mike!
Get rid of them...
Mike, you sure about Moe selling. He never mentioned it to me and he loves the business.
I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.
Tom, you're the Consigliere; you can talk to the Don and advise him.
The Don has semi-retired. I'm running the Family business now. So anything you have to say, say it to me.
The old man wants you; Johnny's here...he's got a problem.
Okay. One minute.
Is the hospital covered?
The cops have it locked in and I got my people there visiting Pop all the time. What about the hit list.
What about Luca? Sollozzo didn't seem worried about Luca. That worries me.
If Luca sold out we're in real trouble.
If Luca sold out we're in real trouble.
Has anyone been able to get in touch with him?

No, and I've been calling all night. Maybe he's shacked up.
No, and I've been calling all night. Maybe he's shacked up.
Luca never sleeps over with a broad. He always goes home when he's through. Mike, keep ringing Luca's number.
Tom, you're the Consigliere, what do we do if the old man dies?
Without your father's political contacts and personal influence, the Corleone family loses half its strength. Without your father, the other New York families might wind up supporting Sollozzo, and the Tattaglias just to make sure there isn't a long destructive war. The old days are over, this is 1946; nobody wants bloodshed anymore. If your father dies...make the deal, Sonny.

Oh Christ Tom, I didn't mean it that way.

We're all tired...
We're all tired...
OK, we sit tight until the old man can give us the lead. But Tom, I want you to stay inside the Mall. You too, Mike, no chances. Tessio, you hold your people in reserve, but have them nosing around the city. The hospital is yours; I want it tight, fool-proof, 24 hours a day.
Maybe Mike shouldn't get mixed up in this so directly. You know the old man doesn't want that.
OK forget it, just stay on the phone.
Was there a definite proposal?
Sure, he wants us to send Mike to meet him to hear his proposition. The promise is the deal will be so good we can't refuse.

No, no Consiglere. Not this time. No more meetings, no more discussions, no more Sollozzo tricks. Give them one message: I WANT SOLLOZZO. If not, it's all out war. We go to the mattresses and we put all the button men out on the street.

No no, no more advice on how to patch it up Tom. You just help me win. Understood?
I found out about this Captain McCluskey who broke Mike's jaw. He's definitely on Sollozzo's payroll, and for big money. McCluskey's agreed to be the Turk's bodyguard. What you have to understand is that while Sollozzo is guarded like this, he's invulnerable. Nobody has ever gunned down a New York Police Captain. Never. It would be disastrous. All the five families would come after
McCluskey can't stay with the Turk forever. We'll wait.
One of Tattaglia's people?
No. Our informer in McCluskey's precinct. Tonight at 8:00 he signed out for Louis' Restaurant in the Bronx. Anyone know it.
Jesus, I don't know...
Can you do it Mike?
Pop, they hit us and we hit them back.
We put out a lot of material through our contacts in the Newspapers...about McCluskey's being tied up with Sollozzo in the Drug Rackets...things are starting to loosen up.
We'll let the old man take it easy for a couple of weeks. I want to get things going good before he gets better. What's the matter with you?
You start operating, the five families will start their raids again. We're at a stalemate Sonny, your war is costing us a lot of money.
You start operating, the five families will start their raids again. We're at a stalemate Sonny, your war is costing us a lot of money.

Well it's war! We might not be in this shape if we had a real war- time Consiglere, a Sicilian. Pop had Genco, who do I have? Hey Tom, hey...hey. It's Sunday, we're gonna have dinner. Don't be sore.
Kay, we weren't expecting you. You should call...
I've tried calling and writing. I want to reach Michael.
I've tried calling and writing. I want to reach Michael.
Nobody knows where he is. We know he's all right, but that's all.
What was that?
An accident. No one was hurt.
An accident. No one was hurt.
Listen Tom, I let my cab go; can I come in to call another one?
Will you give this to him.
If I accept that letter and you told a Court of Law I accepted it, they would interpret it as my having knowledge of his whereabouts. Just wait Kay, he'll contact you.
Will you give this letter to Michael.
Mama, no.
Sonny was hot for my deal, right? You know it's the smart thing to do, too. I want you to talk Sonny into it.
Sonny will come after you with everything he's got.
The Don was slipping; in the old days I could never have gotten to him. Now he's dead, nothing can bring him back. Talk to Sonny, talk to the Caporegimes, Clemenza and Tessio...it's good business.
Even Sonny won't be able to call off Luca Brasi.
Even Sonny won't be able to call off Luca Brasi.
I'll worry about Luca. You take care of Sonny and the other two kids.

I'll try...It's what the Don would want us to do.
I'll try...It's what the Don would want us to do.
Good...then you can go... I don't like violence. I'm a businessman, and blood is a big expense.
Mr. Corleone is Johnny's Godfather. That is very close, a very sacred religious relationship.
Okay, but just tell him this is one favor I can't give. But he should try me again on anything else.
Okay, but just tell him this is one favor I can't give. But he should try me again on anything else.
He never asks a second favor when he has been refused the first. Understood?

You smooth son of a bitch, let me lay it on the line for you, and your boss. Johnny Fontane never gets that movie. I don't care how many Dago, Guinea, wop Greaseball Goombahs come out of the woodwork!

I'm German-Irish.
I'm German-Irish.
Okay my Kraut-Mick friend, Johnny will never get that part because I hate that pinko punk and I'm going to run him out of the Movies. And I'll tell you why. He ruined one of Woltz Brothers' most valuable proteges. For five years I had this girl under training; singing lessons! Acting lessons! Dancing lessons! We spent hundreds of thousands of dollars--I was going
Hello Kay. Your father's inside, doing some business. He's been asking for you.
Thanks Tom.
Sure. Anything I can do for you.
No. I guess I'll see you Christmas. Everyone's going to be out at Long Beach, right?
No. I guess I'll see you Christmas. Everyone's going to be out at Long Beach, right?
Right.
What about McCluskey?
Let's say now that we have to kill McCluskey. We'll clear that up through our Newspaper contacts later.
Mike, why are you cutting me out of the action?
Tom, we're going to be legitimate all the way, and you're the legal man. What could be more important than that.
Tom, we're going to be legitimate all the way, and you're the legal man. What could be more important than that.
I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about Rocco Lampone building a secret regime. Why does Neri report directly to you, rather than through me or a caporegime?
Bookkeepers know everything. Rocco's men are all a little too good for the jobs they're supposed to be doing. They get a little more money than the job's worth. Lampone's a good man; he's operating perfectly.
Not so perfectly if you noticed.
Not so perfectly if you noticed.
Mike, why am I out?
Mike, why am I out?
You're not a wartime Consigliere. Things may get tough with the move we're trying.
You're not a wartime Consigliere. Things may get tough with the move we're trying.
OK, but then I agree with Tessio. You're going about it all wrong; you're making the move out of weakness... Barzini's a wolf, and if he tears you apart, the other families won't come running to help the Corleones...
Christ, Tom; I needed more time with him. I really needed him.
Did he give you his politicians?
Did he give you his politicians?
Not all...I needed another four months and I would have had them all. I guess you've figured it all out?
Not all...I needed another four months and I would have had them all. I guess you've figured it all out?
How will they come at you?
How will they come at you?
I know now. I'll make them call me Don.
I know now. I'll make them call me Don.
Have you agreed on a meeting?
Have you agreed on a meeting?
A week from tonight. In Brooklyn on Tessio's ground, where I'll be safe.
I've never seen anything like it.
I told you I had a lot of relatives.
Michael, what are those men doing?
They're waiting to see my father.
They're waiting to see my father.
They're talking to themselves.
They're talking to themselves.
They're going to talk to my father, which means they're going to ask him for something, which means they better get it right.
They're going to talk to my father, which means they're going to ask him for something, which means they better get it right.
Why do they bother him on a day like this?
Why do they bother him on a day like this?
Because they know that no Sicilian will refuse a request on his daughter's wedding day.
No. His name is Luca Brasi. You wouldn't like him.
Who is he?
Who is he?
You really want to know?
You really want to know?
Yes. Tell me.
Yes. Tell me.
You like spaghetti?
You like spaghetti?
You know I love spaghetti.
You know I love spaghetti.
Then eat your spaghetti and I'll tell you a Luca Brasi story.
Once upon a time, about fifteen years ago some people wanted to take over my father's olive oil business. They had Al Capone send some men in from Chicago to kill my father, and they almost did.
Al Capone!
Al Capone!
My Father sent Luca Brasi after them. He tied the two Capone men hand and foot, and stuffed small bath towels into their mouths. Then he took an ax, and chopped one man's feet off...

Michael, I love you.
Michael, I love you.
...who out of sheer terror had swallowed the bath towel in his mouth and suffocated.
I never know when you're telling me the truth.
I told you you wouldn't like him.
I told you you wouldn't like him.
He's coming over here!
Tom...Tom, I'd like you to meet Kay Adams.
How do you do.
How do you do.
My brother, Tom Hagen.
If he's your brother, why does he have a different name?
My brother Sonny found him living in the streets when he was a kid, so my father took him in. He's a good lawyer.
I didn't know your family knew Johnny Fontane.
Sure.
Sure.
I used to come down to New York whenever he sang at the Capitol and scream my head off.
I used to come down to New York whenever he sang at the Capitol and scream my head off.
He's my father's godson; he owes him his whole career.
We have something for your mother, for Sonny, we have the tie for Fredo and Tom Hagen gets the Reynolds pen...
And what do you want for Christmas?
And what do you want for Christmas?
Just you.
What will your father say?
As long as I tell him beforehand he won't object. He'll be hurt, but he won't object.

What time do they expect us?

For dinner. Unless I call and tell them we're still in New Hampshire.

Michael.

Then we can have dinner, see a show, and spend one more night.
Michael, what are you doing?
Shhh, you be the long distance operator. Here.
Shhh, you be the long distance operator. Here.
Hello...this is Long Distance. I have a call from New Hampshire. Mr. Michael Corleone. One moment please.
Would you like me better if I were a nun?
No.
No.
Would you like me better if I were Ingrid Bergman?
Michael?
I'm thinking about it.
I'm thinking about it.
Michael...
Michael...
No, I would not like you better if you were Ingrid Bergman.
Hello. Kay?
How is your father?
How is your father?
He'll be OK.
He'll be OK.
I love you.
I LOVE YOU.
Yeah Kay, I'm here.
Yeah Kay, I'm here.
Can you say it?
Can you say it?
Huh?
Huh?
Tell me you love me.
I can't...
Please say it.
Please say it.
Look. I'll see you tonight, OK?
Look. I'll see you tonight, OK?
OK.
Visiting hour ends at eight thirty. I'll just sit with him; I want to show respect.
Can I go to the hospital with you?
Can I go to the hospital with you?
I don't think so. You don't want to end up on page 3 of the Daily News.
I don't think so. You don't want to end up on page 3 of the Daily News.
My parents don't read the Daily News. All right, if you think I shouldn't. I can't believe the things the papers are printing. I'm sure most of it's not true.

I don't think so either. I better go.
I don't think so either. I better go.
When will I see you again?
When will I see you again?
I want you to go back to New Hampshire...think things over.
When will I see you again?
Goodbye.
I have to see my father and his people when we get back to the Mall.
Oh Michael.
Oh Michael.
We'll go to the show tomorrow night--we can change the tickets.
We'll go to the show tomorrow night--we can change the tickets.
Don't you want dinner first?
Don't you want dinner first?
No, you eat...don't wait up for me.
No, you eat...don't wait up for me.
Wake me up when you come to bed?
Your sister wants to ask you something.
Let HER ask.
Why are you so cold to her and Carlo? They live with us on the Mall now, but you never get close to them.
I'm busy.
I'm busy.
Connie and Carlo want you to be godfather to their little boy.
Will you?
Let me think about it, O.K.?
Michael, it's not true. Please tell me.
Don't ask me.
Don't ask me.
Tell me!
Tell me!
All right, this one time I'll let you ask about my affairs, one last time.
All right, this one time I'll let you ask about my affairs, one last time.
Is it true?
I'm Michael Corleone--this is my father. What happened to the detectives who were guarding him?
Oh your father just had too many visitors. It interfered with the hospital service. The police came and made them all leave just ten minutes ago. But don't worry. I look in on him.

You just stand here one minute...
You cannot stay here...I'm sorry.
You and I are going to move my father right now...to another room on another floor...Can you disconnect those tubes so we can wheel the bed out?
You and I are going to move my father right now...to another room on another floor...Can you disconnect those tubes so we can wheel the bed out?
Absolutely not! We have to get permission from the Doctor.
Absolutely not! We have to get permission from the Doctor.
You've read about my father in the papers. You've seen that no one's here to guard him. Now I've just gotten word that men are coming to this hospital to kill him. Believe me and help me.

We don't have to disconnect them, we can wheel the stand with the bed.
I was worried when we couldn't get in touch with you in that hick town.
How's Mom?
How's Mom?
Good. She's been through it before. Me too. You were too young to know about it. You better wait outside; there're some things you shouldn't hear.

I can help you out...

Oh no you can't, the old man'd be sore as hell if I let you get mixed up in this.
Oh no you can't, the old man'd be sore as hell if I let you get mixed up in this.
Jesus Christ, he's my father, Sonny.
Jesus Christ, he's my father, Sonny.
Theresa.
All right, Mikey...who do we have to hit, Clemenza or Paulie?
What?
What?
One of them fingered the old man.
Clemenza? No, I don't believe it.
You're right, kid, Clemenza is okay. It was Paulie.
You're right, kid, Clemenza is okay. It was Paulie.
How can you be sure?
How can you be sure?
On the three days Paulie was sick this month, he got calls from a payphone across from the old man's building. We got people in the phone company. Thank God it was Paulie...we'll need Clemenza bad.
Is it going to be all-out war, like last time?
Until the old man tells me different.
Until the old man tells me different.
Then wait, Sonny. Talk to Pop.
Then wait, Sonny. Talk to Pop.
Sollozzo is a dead man, I don't care what it costs. I don't care if we have to fight all the five families in New York. The Tattaglia family's going to eat dirt. I don't care if we all go down together.

That's not how Pop would have played it.
That's not how Pop would have played it.
I know I'm not the man he was. But I'll tell you this and he'll tell you too. When it comes to real action, I can operate as good as anybody short range.

Christ, if I could only contact Luca.
Christ, if I could only contact Luca.
Is it like they say? Is he that good?
Where are you going?
To the city.
To the city.
Send some bodyguards.
Send some bodyguards.
I don't need them, Sonny. I'm just going to see Pop in the hospital. Also, I got other things.
Sonny...Sonny--Jesus Christ, I'm down at the hospital. I came down late. There's no one here. None of Tessio's people--no detectives, no one. The old man is completely unprotected.
All right, get him in a different room; lock the door from the inside. I'll have some men there inside of fifteen minutes. Sit tight, and don't panic.

I won't panic.
Mikey, you look beautiful!
Cut it out.
Cut it out.
The Turk wants to talk! The nerve of that son of a bitch! After he craps out last night he wants a meet.
We can't wait. No matter what Sollozzo say about a deal, he's figuring out how to kill Pop. You have to get Sollozzo now.
The kid's right.
Go on Mike.
They want me to go to the conference with Sollozzo. Set up the meeting for two days from now. Sonny, get our informers to find out where the meeting will be held. Insist it has to be a public place: a bar or restaurant at the height of the dinner hour. So I'll feel safe. They'll check me when I meet them so I
Why don't you stop living like a bum and get this place cleaned up.
What are you, inspecting the barracks? You ready? Did Clemenza tell you be sure to drop the gun right away?
What are you, inspecting the barracks? You ready? Did Clemenza tell you be sure to drop the gun right away?
A million times.
A million times.
Sollozzo and McCluskey are going to pick you up in an hour and a half on Times Square, under the big Camels sign.
O.K. How long do you think before I can come back?
Probably a year...
I'm glad you came, Mike. I hope we can straighten everything out. All this is terrible, it's not the way I wanted things to happen at all. It should never have happened.
I want to settle things tonight. I want my father left alone.
I want to settle things tonight. I want my father left alone.
He won't be; I swear to you be my children he won't be. Just keep an open mind when we talk. I hope you're not a hothead like your brother, Sonny. It's impossible to talk business with him.
We're going to New Jersey?
Maybe.
Most important...I want a sure guarantee that no more attempts will be made on my father's life.
What guarantees can I give you? I am the hunted one. I've missed my chance. You think too highly of me, my friend...I am not so clever...all I want if a truce...
What is it?
Is it all right if I go to the bathroom?
Do you pledge to guide and protect this child if he is left fatherless? Do you promise to shield him against the wickedness of the world?
Yes, I promise.
Do you renounce Satan.
I do renounce him.
I do renounce him.
And all his works?
And all his works?
I do renounce them.
Do you wish to be baptized?
I do wish to be baptized.
Barzini's people chisel my territory and we do nothing about it. Pretty soon there won't be one place in Brooklyn I can hang my hat.
Just be patient.
Just be patient.
I'm not asking you for help, Mike. Just take off the handcuffs.
I'm not asking you for help, Mike. Just take off the handcuffs.
Be patient.
Let us fill up our Regimes.
No. I want things very calm for another six months.
No. I want things very calm for another six months.
Forgive me, Godfather, let our years of friendship be my excuse. How can you hope for success there without your strength here to back you up? The two go hand in hand. And with you gone from here the Barzini and the Tattaglias will be too strong for us.
Barzini wants to arrange a meeting. Says we can straighten any of our problems out.
He talked to you?
He talked to you?
I can arrange security.
Mike, good to see you. Got everything you want?
Thanks.
Thanks.
The chef cooked for you special; the dancers will kick your tongue out and you credit is good! Draw chips for all these people so they can play on the house.

You took Freddie in because the Corleone family bankrolled your casino. You and the Corleone family are evened out. This is for business; name your price.
You took Freddie in because the Corleone family bankrolled your casino. You and the Corleone family are evened out. This is for business; name your price.
The Corleone family don't have that kind of muscle anymore. The Godfather is sick. You're getting chased out of New York by Barzini and the other families, and you think you can find easier pickings here. I've talked to Barzini; I can make a deal with him and keep my hotel!

Is that why you thought you could slap Freddie around in public?
You straightened my brother out?
Hell, he was banging cocktail waitresses two at a time. Players couldn't get a drink.
I have to go back to New York tomorrow. Think of your price.
You son of a bitch, you think you can brush me off like that? I made my bones when you were going out with cheerleaders.
Yeah.
Do you recognize my voice?

I think so. Detective squad?

Find out anything you can...you got a Grand coming.
How do you do.
What are you doing in Mongi?
You should come and have lunch with us, before you go -- Dickie?
Sure. Any time.
Sure. Any time.
And be careful in the sun. Your gray's in danger of turning a little pink.
Sorry, sorry, sorry. I know, I'm late, I'm a swine.

Yes, Tom Ripley's here.
Tom was telling me about his trip over. Made me laugh so much I got a nosebleed.
Is that good?
Is that good?
Shut up!
I'll do it. I make a fabulous martini.
Everybody should have one talent. What's yours?
What? What?
Meet my father, Herbert Richard Greenleaf 1st.
Uncanny!

I'll come down.

Did you speak to my father?
Okay, we're going to Naples. There's a club, it's not a club, it's a cellar.
It's vile.
It's vile.
Yes, it's vile. Don't worry, you don't have to come. It's great. You're going to love it.
It'll just be for a little while. He can be... he makes me laugh.
Okay, darling.
Okay, darling.
You'd say if you mind?

No, I like him.
No, I like him.
Marge, you like everybody.

I don't like you.

Then I'll go to your place and you can move in with Tom.
Now you know why Miss Sherwood always shows up for breakfast. It's not love it's the coffee machine.
It's the one task Dickie can do on his own -- make coffee.

Shut up.
Shut up.
Oh darling -- is that for me?
Oh darling -- is that for me?
No it's for Tom as he didn't complain.
I had to promise, capital P, never to take it off -- otherwise I'd give it to you.
Bastard! Isn't it great, Tom? I found it in Naples. I bargained for about two weeks.
Bastard! Isn't it great, Tom? I found it in Naples. I bargained for about two weeks.
I hope it wasn't cheap.
I hope it wasn't cheap.
Oh, it was.
Dubious but special honor, Tom -- crewing Dickie's boat. Alright, bar's open.
Yes please!
If you're not at my place by 7.00, Tom and I are running off together.
Okay.
He's drowning me!
It's always the same whenever someone new comes into his life -- Freddie, Fausto, Peter Smith-Kingsley -- he's wonderful -- did you meet him, he's a musician? -- ...and especially you, of course... and that's only the boys.
Well, she was already dead, darling, wasn't she, so I suppose --
I don't know why people say this country's civilised. It isn't. It's fucking primitive.
Who's this?
It's Tom. Tom Ripley. We were at Princeton together.

Okay. And did we know each other?

Nothing. Nothing much. Passing through.
Passing through! You're so white. Did you ever see a guy so white, Marge? Gray, actually.

It's just an undercoat.

Say again?
Say again?
You know, a primer.
You know, a primer.
That's funny.
Who? Oh, Tom, hello, how are you? We thought you'd disappeared. We were going to send out a search party.
No, still here.
I'm intruding.
Can you mix a martini?

I met him in New York.
I met him in New York.
Marge! You've got to hear this!
Could you ever conceive of going there, Tom, and bringing him back?
What?
What?
I'd pay you. If you would go to Italy and persuade my son to come home. I'd pay you $1000.
I'm never going back!
No, I think your mother, her illness --

Go back! Go back to New York or call him if you can find a telephone that works, and tell him wild horses wouldn't drag me back to him or his shipyard.
You like jazz!
I love jazz.
I love jazz.
This is the best. Marge says she likes jazz, but she things Glenn Miller is jazz.
Bird! Ask me the name of my sailboat --
I don't know. What's the name of your sailboat?
I don't know. What's the name of your sailboat?
Bird!
Good afternoon!
What time is it? Oh God! Do you always type your letters? That should be two Ts.

I can't write and I can't spell. That's the privilege of a first-class education. You're upstairs at the back. I think Ermelinda made the bed up.

This is so good of you.
This is so good of you.
Don't say it again. Now you're a Double Agent and we're going to string my Dad along, I was thinking we might buy a little car with the expense money he's sending you. What do you think, Marge... a little Cinquecento with my Dad's money?
You're a dark horse, Ripley. Engaged?
Your parents met her.
Your parents met her.
Oh God -- I can just imagine -- if only Dickie would settle down... doesn't every parent deserve a grandchild? Never! I swear on your ring, Marge. I am never going back.
I'm doing this wrong, aren't I?
You're doing great. We'll make a sailor of you yet. You're doing really well.
Could we sail to Venice?
Sure. I love Venice.
Sure. I love Venice.
I have to go to Venice.
I have to go to Venice.
See Venice and die, isn't that right? Or is it Rome? You do something and die, don't you? Okay, Venice is on the list.

Do you ski? Don't tell me -- you're a lost cause! That's the next thing to deal with. We're planning to go to Cortina at Christmas. Excellent skiing. Excellent. Marge -- Ripley can't ski. We'll have to teach him that, too. Have you ever known such low class?
You're breaking my ribs!
What?
What?
You're breaking my ribs!
I could fuck this icebox I love it so much. What were you actually doing in New York?
I played piano in a few places.

That's one job, you told me a lot of jobs.

Copy out from here...
I love the fact you brought Shakespeare with you and no clothes. Ermelinda says you wash the same shirt out every night. Is that true?
No! I've got more than one shirt!
No! I've got more than one shirt!
She can do that stuff for you. Anyway, just wear some of my things, wear anything you want, most of it's ancient.

Now your signature. Not "Dickie". Your signature.
Without the glasses you're not even ugly. I don't need them because I never read. How do I look.
Like Clark Kent. Now Superman.
I know. I write like a child.
Pretty vile. See this: The S and the T, do you see? -- fine, vulnerable -- that's pain, that's secret pain.

Well we certainly know that's true.
Do you have any brothers?
No, no brothers, no sisters.
No, no brothers, no sisters.
Me neither. Nor does Marge. All only children -- what does that mean?
Means we never shared a bath. I'm cold. Can I get in?
No!
No!
I didn't mean with you in it.
I didn't mean with you in it.
Okay, you get in. I'm like a prune anyway.

He's getting impatient. He wants me to reassure him you'll be home by Thanksgiving.

I can't. I can't keep spending your father's money.
I love how responsible you are. My Dad should make you Chief Accountant or something. Let me buy you a jacket. There's a great place when we get to Rome, Batistoni.
Where do we find a carozza for the Forum, or can we hire any of them -- ?
Relax.
Relax.
It's just there's so much to do in a single day.

Freddie?
Freddie?
Freddie Miles. You know -- he's organizing the Cortina skiing trip.
Look, Tom, we've got to go to a club and meet some friends of Freddie's. The best thing is -- if you want to be a tourist -- grab a cab and we can meet up at the railway station.
What club?
What club?
Freddie's arranged it with some of the skiing crowd. Come if you want but I thought you wanted to see the Forum...?

I was just fooling around. Don't say anything. Sorry.
What's the fight about? That's her fiancee, isn't it? Are they blaming him?
I don't know! Why are you asking me? How can it take an hour to find an ambulance?
She was pregnant. Did you know that? Do you know what that means in a place like this?
I'm prepared to take the blame.

I'm not going to say anything -- to Marge, or anybody, the police -- It's a secret between us and I'll keep it.
...The thousand dollars, of course, was only due in the event that you succeeded in bringing Dickie home. Naturally, I hope the trip has afforded you some pleasure despite the failure of its main objective you need no longer consider yourself obligated to us in any way...
You can't blame him. You could hardly expect this to go on forever.

What about Venice? Can we stick to that plan at least?
What about Venice? Can we stick to that plan at least?
I don't think so, Tom. You can't stay on here without money. It's time we all moved on. Besides I'm sick of Mongi. Especially now with everything -- I really want to move to the North. I need to check out San Remo next week, find somewhere new to keep the boat. But it would be great, though, if you came with me. Our

No reason. Because you're leaving, I guess. I don't think you were there, were you?

Why?
I mean it as a compliment. You've got such great taste, I don't know. Most of the thugs at Princeton had tasted everything and had no taste. Used to say, the cream of America: rich and thick. Freddie's the perfect example.

I've gotten to like it. I've gotten to like everything about the way you live. It's one big love affair. If you knew my life back home in New York...
I'm thinking of giving up the sax, what do you think about drums?
What?
What?
So cool.
I wanted to tell you my plan.
So tell me.

Really? To Italy?
Really? To Italy?
Of course. Let's say, for argument's sake, you were here -- perhaps we could split the rent on a house -- I'll get a job -- or, better still, I could get a place in Rome and when we're there we could be there and if we're here we could be here --

No, no, it's not a threat, I've explained all of that.
No, no, it's not a threat, I've explained all of that.
I'm actually a little relieved you're going, to be honest. I think we've seen enough of each other for a while.
What?
You can be a leech -- you know this -- and it's boring. You can be quite boring.

What evening?
Sure -- I know, that's too dangerous for you, fair enough, hey! we're brothers, fine, then you do this sordid thing with Marge, fucking her on the boat while we all have to listen, which was excruciating, frankly, plus you follow your cock around like a -- and now you're getting married! I'm bewildered, forgive me... you're lying to Marge then getting married to
Frederico!
Ciao bello. Don't you want to fuck every woman you see. Just once.
This is Tom Ripley. Freddie Miles.
Hey, if I'm late, think what her husband's saying!
Dick -- you've got to hear this!
Listen, just take one of mine when we get back. Don't worry about it. I did the Forum with Marge and, frankly, once is enough in anyone's life.
Come on, Frederico, do you really have to go back? At least stick around for the Festival of the Madonna.
I don't think so. Come back with me to Rome. There's this great new club. Have some drinks, lotta ladies...
Do you think you can steer this thing?
Sure.
Sure.
Just point her at Capri and avoid the rocks.

Oh hello, where's Dickie? How are you?

Yes, I'm good, thank you. Dickies at dinner. He's at Otello's. Do you know it?
Yes, I'm good, thank you. Dickies at dinner. He's at Otello's. Do you know it?
I don't think he's at dinner at 6.30pm. If you said he was still at lunch I'd believe you. Incredible. The guy has disappeared off the face of the earth.

He was supposed to come skiing. I didn't get a cable or a call or a note or, frankly, a fart.
Of course, he's been very involved in his music, hasn't he? I think his theory is, you know, you have to go into a cocoon before you can become a butterfly.
Which is horseshit. Have you heard him play that thing? He can't.

How did you find him? It's such an out of the way apartment. Can I fix you a drink?

No thanks. Some kid at the American Express Office. Are you living here?
No. No, I'm staying here for a few days, in Rome. That's a new piano, so you prob --
Did this place come furnished? It doesn't look like Dickie. Horrible isn't it? -- so bourgeois.
You should watch that!
In fact the only thing which looks like Dickie is you.
In fact the only thing which looks like Dickie is you.
Hardly.
Hardly.
Have you done something to your hair?
Freddie, do you have something to say?
What? I think I'm saying it. Something's going on. He's either converted to Christianity -- or to something else.

I suggest you ask Dickie that yourself. Otello's is on delle Croce, just off the Corso.

Is it on "delle Croce, just off the Corso"? You're a quick study, aren't you? Last time you didn't know your ass from your elbow, now you're giving me directions. That's not fair, you probably do know your ass from your elbow. I'll see you.
Most enjoyable. Herbert Greenleaf.
Tom Ripley. Thank you, sir.
Tom Ripley. Thank you, sir.
I see you were at Princeton. Then you'll most likely know our son, Dick. Dickie Greenleaf...
Could you ever conceive of going to Italy, Tom, persuade my son to come home? I'd pay you. I'd pay you 1000 dollars.
I've always wanted to go to Europe, sir, but...
I've always wanted to go to Europe, sir, but...
Good. Now you can go for a reason.

Far cry from New York.
Far cry from New York.
Yes it is.
Yes it is.
Marge, good morning. Unusual weather.
Yes. What's the detective hoping to find in San Remo?
He's being thorough, that's all. I'm learning about my son, Tom, now he's missing. I'm learning a great deal about him. I hope you can fill in some more blanks for me. Marge has been good enough to do that, about Mongibello.

I'll try my best, sir. Obviously I'll do anything to help Dickie.
No, Marge doesn't know the half of it.
I think it might hurt her to know.
I think it might hurt her to know.
And his passport photo? Did you hear? To scratch out your own face like that -- can you imagine -- the frame of mind you'd have to be in? I've thought about going to the police but I can't face it. I can't face anything anymore.

I feel guilty. I feel like I pushed him away. I spoke and he heard you.
I feel guilty. I feel like I pushed him away. I spoke and he heard you.
Well, if we all pushed him away what about him pushing us away? You've been a great friend to my son. Everything is someone else's fault. We all want to sow wild oars. Somebody's got to -- what's the word? The moment someone confronts him he lashes out. He lashes out. You know, people always say you can't choose your parents, but you can't
Tom.
Hello, sir. Marge, you should have waited, didn't Peter tell you I'd come by and pick you up?
Hello, sir. Marge, you should have waited, didn't Peter tell you I'd come by and pick you up?
Marge has been telling us about the rings.

You know I feel ridiculous I didn't mention them yesterday -- I clean forgot -- ridiculous.
You know I feel ridiculous I didn't mention them yesterday -- I clean forgot -- ridiculous.
Perhaps you didn't mention them because there's only one conclusion to be drawn.
I'm going to take Marge for a little walk, Tom. Mr MacCarron wants to talk with you.
We could go down to the bar -- no need for you to --
We could go down to the bar -- no need for you to --
No, he should talk to you alone.
Pretty good. Sticking with hot water.
Where's Mr MacCarron?
Where's Mr MacCarron?
San Remo. The police are amateurs. Well, my boy, it's come to a pretty pass, hasn't it?
This theory, the letter he left for you, the Police think that's a clear indication he was planning on doing something... to himself.
I just don't believe that!
I just don't believe that!
You don't want to, dear. I'd like to talk to Tom alone -- perhaps this afternoon? Would you mind? Marge, what a man may say to his sweetheart and what he'll admit to another fellow --

What a waste of lives and opportunities and --
I don't know, I don't know, I just know it.
Marge, there's female intuition, and then there are facts --
Thanks so much for inviting me tonight.
Can you bear it? We hear you're a friend of Freddie's -- he has I hate Opera tattooed on his chest.

I'm sure we've met.
I was sure we'd met, weren't you, Ted? This is Herbert Greenleaf's boy.
Thanks, yes, I think we did.
Thanks, yes, I think we did.
One minute you people are children and the next you're getting tattooed.
Is Mr Greenleaf here?
Mr Ripley? I'm Alvin MacCarron.
I could probably see my bedroom from here. I can see my house. When you see where you live from a distance it's like a dream, isn't it?
I don't care for B.S. I don't care to hear it. I don't care to speak it.
I don't care for B.S. I don't care to hear it. I don't care to speak it.
Okay.
Okay.
Why do you think Dickie's father sent him to Europe in the first place? Did you know at Princeton Dickie Greenleaf half-killed a boy?
Mr Greenleaf appreciates your loyalty. He really does. Marge, she's got a hundred theories, but there are a few things she doesn't know. We hope she never knows.
I hope she never knows.
I hope she never knows.
Three different people saw Dickie get into Freddie Miles' car. A man who won't identify himself because he was jumping someone else's wife at the time saw Dickie removing license plates from a red sports car. The Police know about this man because he happens to be a Policeman.
Pleasure to meet you, Dickie's made a fine catch. I know Emily thinks so.
What's going on?
You were right about the telephones. There are no lines, there's some problem.
Hello Tom. You're off? What are your plans?
Hello Tom. You're off? What are your plans?
Back, I suppose, slowly as I can.
I never said that!
Bird. That's jazz.
Which is ridiculous. Boats are female, everyone knows you can't call a boat after a man.
He's not a man, he's a god.
Dickie, you can't even drive a car! No, what we need urgently is an icebox. What do you think, Tom? Agree with me and I'll be your friend for life.
I absolutely agree with Marge.
That ring's so great. The green one.
Tom, I love you! See! I bought it for him, for his birthday.
Tom, I love you! See! I bought it for him, for his birthday.
It's superb.
I have to find a birthday present for Frances. Perhaps you can help me?
Frances?
Frances?
My fiancée.
You really should go in, it's marvelous.
I'm fine.
Are you okay?
Sure.
The thing with Dickie -- it's like the sun shines on you and it's glorious, then he forgets you and it's very very cold.
So I'm learning.
So I'm learning.
He's not even aware of it. When you've got his attention you feel like you're the only person in the world. That's why everybody loves him. Other times...
Tell me, why is it when men play they always play at killing each other...? I'm sorry about Cortina by the way.
What about Cortina?
What about Cortina?
Didn't Dick say? -- He talked to Freddie... apparently it's not going to work out -- Freddie says there aren't enough rooms.
Dickie!
I'll go and see what's the matter.
I'll go and see what's the matter.
I'll go.
Hello Marge.
Tom, you startled me! You're back.
Tom, you startled me! You're back.
How are you? Sorry. Is your book going well?
How are you? Sorry. Is your book going well?
Yes -- I'm on a good streak, thanks.

I was just looking at you -- so quiet.

I think he's planning on staying in Rome for a few days.

I don't know. I don't understand Dickie, Marge, so your guess is as good as mine.
I don't know. I don't understand Dickie, Marge, so your guess is as good as mine.
What does that mean?

Well, one day I'm invited skiing, the next day I'm not, one day we're all one family, the next day he wants to be alone. You tell me.
Well, one day I'm invited skiing, the next day I'm not, one day we're all one family, the next day he wants to be alone. You tell me.
Is that what he said -- he wanted to be alone?
Is that what he said -- he wanted to be alone?
He was thinking of you, Marge -- he asked me to deliver this.
Thanks. He knows I love this, although why it couldn't have waited...
Errand number one -- deliver Marge's perfume. Errand number two, pack some clothes and his precious saxophone.
Errand number one -- deliver Marge's perfume. Errand number two, pack some clothes and his precious saxophone.
How long's he staying for?
How long's he staying for?
Search me. I guess we're abandoned.
He hates being confronted.
I think you're right.
Oh my God. Tom.
Marge, how are you? What are you doing in Rome?
Marge, how are you? What are you doing in Rome?
Is he here? Are you with Dickie?
Is he here? Are you with Dickie?
No. Hello, I'm Tom Ripley.
Is he really not here?
Marge, you know Dickie has I hate Opera tattooed on his chest.
Marge, you know Dickie has I hate Opera tattooed on his chest.
You were going to Venice.
Dickie was at the Opera last night.
I don't believe it. Wild horses wouldn't drag Dickie to --
I don't believe it. Wild horses wouldn't drag Dickie to --
He was there with someone. So I suppose she must have dragged him -- that's not fair. I'm going back to Mongi. I think Dickie's coming home. I'm going to go home.
He was there with someone. So I suppose she must have dragged him -- that's not fair. I'm going back to Mongi. I think Dickie's coming home. I'm going to go home.
Really? That's swell. No, I was just -- you're way ahead of me! Great!
Did he kill Freddie?
Marge, when did you get here?
Marge, when did you get here?
Tell me the truth. Did he kill Freddie?
Tell me the truth. Did he kill Freddie?
I'd swear he didn't. Of course he didn't.
I'd swear he didn't. Of course he didn't.
I tried again, waiting here, watching for him. Instead it's you. Whenever I look for Dickie I find you. What happened to your face?

My face! There was an argument. I said some things I shouldn't have. About you. About the appalling way he's treating you, all of us. And the next thing I know he's launched himself at me. Are you getting on?

What?
What?
Get on. I'll take you to him.
Where does Dickie live?
We passed it a few blocks back, where the police were. The Palazzo Gioia. They don't even know I'm in Rome and I'm not going to incriminate Dickie --

Perhaps I shouldn't go either.
Perhaps I shouldn't go either.
No, well go if you want to, but don't talk to the Police about my face -- they find out he hit me -- he's got a temper -- he could've hit Freddie. Good luck, Marge. I'll catch up with you later.
Hello Peter, so good to see you.
Hello Marge!
Hello Marge!
Tom.
I was looking forward to seeing him.
Dickie hasn't killed himself. I'm sure of that. There's a private detective on the case now -- a Mr MacCarron -- Dickie's father's employing him.
Dickie hasn't killed himself. I'm sure of that. There's a private detective on the case now -- a Mr MacCarron -- Dickie's father's employing him.
That's a terrific idea.
That's a terrific idea.
He's American. He's already discovered Dickie cashed checks for $1000 the day before he disappeared.
Look at me what?
To the manner born.
Very.
And you, sir? Any better?
Did Dickie's Dad go?
He's having an early night.
He's having an early night.
Poor man. We were knocking on that door for ever. I think I've broken my strap.
Tom?
Marge, I'm in the bath. Won't be long.
Marge, I'm in the bath. Won't be long.
Tom, I need to talk to you. It's urgent.
I found Dickie's rings.
What?
What?
You've got Dickie's rings.
You've got Dickie's rings.
I can explain.
Dickie promised me he would never take off this ring.
Let me put on some clothes and then we can talk about this.

I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf.

Marge, calm down, you're being hysterical.

He promised me. I swear I'll never take off this ring until the day --
He promised me. I swear I'll never take off this ring until the day --
Shut up! Shut up!
Marge? Where are you going?
I was looking for a needle and thread. I wasn't snooping. I was looking for a needle and thread to mend my bra.
I was looking for a needle and thread. I wasn't snooping. I was looking for a needle and thread to mend my bra.
The scent you're wearing. I bought it for you, not Dickie. The thing about Dickie. So many things. The day he was late back from Rome -- I tried to tell you this -- he was with another girl. I'm not talking about Meredith, another girl we met in a bar. He couldn't be faithful for five minutes. So when he makes a promise
Today, for the first time, I've even wondered whether he might have killed Freddie. He would get so crazy if anybody contradicted him -- well, you know that. Marge. I loved you -- you might as well know -- I loved you, and because he knew I loved you, he let you think I loved him. Didn't you see, couldn't you see? I don't
Why do you have Dickie's rings?
I told you. He gave them to me.
Why? When?
Why? When?
I feel as if you haven't heard anything I've been saying to you.
I feel as if you haven't heard anything I've been saying to you.
I don't believe you.
I don't believe you.
It's all true.
It's all true.
I don't believe a single word you've said.
But I hope that note goes to New York in your purse, for a rainy day.
What are you going to do now, Tom?
What are you going to do now, Tom?
I don't know. Peter has a concert in Athens next month -- and he's asked if I want to go along, help out. He says goodbye by the way -- he's in rehearsal, otherwise --

I know it was you -- I know it was you, Tom. I know it was you. I know you killed Dickie. I know it was you.
I know it was you -- I know it was you, Tom. I know it was you. I know you killed Dickie. I know it was you.
Oh Marge.
Dickie? Do you know Dickie?
You were at the Opera? Well, that explains -- yes I was there. I was there with Dickie.
You were at the Opera? Well, that explains -- yes I was there. I was there with Dickie.
I told you! I knew it!
I told you! I knew it!
Marge, I don't know you, so I have no right, but Dickie loves you. He's -- I think you'll find he's coming home to you.
Marge, I don't know you, so I have no right, but Dickie loves you. He's -- I think you'll find he's coming home to you.
How would you know that?
How would you know that?
He told me everything. I was supposed to meet him fifteen minutes ago, so I... I'm going to go now, I think. Unless he meant us to meet -- which would be a little cruel, wouldn't it?
Peter Smith-Kingsley. I've heard about you, of course -- from Marge, and Dickie.
No glasses.
Look there's Meredith thingy -- who's that, Marge? -- They're in textiles... Meredith -- God, how awful, I've spent Christmas in her house...!
I don't know her. He hasn't called, he's hardly written, just these cryptic notes. You don't just dump people.
No, we're meeting another friend. Tom Ripley.
Do you know Tom?
We think he's had a change of heart. So we should be celebrating.
I hope so.
I hope so.
That was moving, wasn't it? When Meredith said -- Meredith's the American girl I saw last night, I know her, at the Opera, she's been seeing something of Dickie --
So you found Peter...
I think we sort of found each other.
Where's Dickie's father?
He's not coming till the morning. Evidently his stomach -- I don't think the food here is agreeing with him.
Is this you?
No, it's Tom's. Splendid, eh?
No, it's Tom's. Splendid, eh?
Golly. Who's paying for this?
This is spectacular.
That's why Tom wanted you to stay. It's better than squeezing into my room, and I know how you hate hotels.
That's why Tom wanted you to stay. It's better than squeezing into my room, and I know how you hate hotels.
A hotel would've been fine. We'll have to tell Mr Greenleaf how far his dollar has stretched.
What's funny?
No, nothing. I'm just thinking about when Tom arrived in Mongi. And now look at you.
What's your secret?
Excuse me?
Excuse me?
No, it's just -- you are American, aren't you? -- no, I just, I have so much luggage, and you're so, uh, streamlined. It's humiliating.
I'm Meredith, by the way. Meredith Randall.
Dickie, Dickie Greenleaf. Hello.

Now? I don't think so. But I've met him, of course, and we've chatted and I know about you and Marge and Mongi and what an unreliable rat you are. Freddie said you were a rat and I thought to myself now I know why he travels under R.

Sorry, I wouldn't have made a joke if --
Sorry, I wouldn't have made a joke if --
Don't be sorry. I've never been happier. I feel like I've been handed a new life.
The truth is if you've had money your entire life, even if you despise it, which we do -- agreed? -- you're only truly comfortable around other people who have it and despise it.
I know.
I know.
I've never admitted that to anyone.
Show me the other one again. I like them both.
I'll take them both.
Let's go.

C'mon, I need to talk to you. Just the two of us.
Okay then, you're crazy.

Otherwise you'd be fighting me off.

Beating you away.
Will you meet me tomorrow? Just to say goodbye in the daylight, properly? So it's not just this, it's too... you should always save pain for daylight...
Oh Meredith, I'm sorry. Of course I'll meet you. Let's have coffee in the morning at Dinelli's.

When I thought about you I was mostly hating you. Where've you been hiding?

Peter Smith-Kingsley? I haven't seen him in months. No, I'm alone.
Ho assunto io la guida delle indagini in seguito alla negativa valutazione delle disdicevoli circostanze verificatesi con il mio predecessore Roverini che come e noto non e riuscito a impedire il verificarsi della scomparsa del signor Greenleaf, il quale era l'unica persona al momento passibile di incriminazione del reato di omicidio del signor Miles.
He's taken over the case because... they're annoyed the previous chap let Dickie... disappear when he was the only, he was the only suspect in Freddie's murder.

Quando e stata l'ultima volta che il signor Ripley ha visto il signor Greenleaf?
Dove e stato il signor Ripley da allora?
Where have you been since then?
All'aperto? Col freddo che ha fatto?
He thinks it's very cold to be sleeping outside.

Non e questo il luogo per le vostre conversazioni private!
A ragione. A ragione.

Hmm. C'e questa...
Questa lettera e stata trovata nell'abitazione del signor Richard Greenleaf a Roma.
They found this in Dickie's place in Rome.
Ditto.
Where are you hiding him? He's impossible, isn't he?
Yes, what happened? I heard you were desperate to come. I was looking forward to rowing you around.
I am. I really am. And I've been travelling. I just can't seem to get that far north.

Okay. Marge, see you tomorrow. It's really good to meet you.
Sorry, sorry. Had to renew my papers. Italian bureaucracy -- never one stamp when they can make you line up for three. Have you been waiting long?
Not at all. Morning Tom.
Not at all. Morning Tom.
Hi. Sorry. You okay? You look as if you've seen a ghost...
My God.
But the point is Dickie -- well we know this -- Dickie loves Marge and he misses her and apparently he's come to his senses...
But the point is Dickie -- well we know this -- Dickie loves Marge and he misses her and apparently he's come to his senses...
It's fantastic. I feel guilty. Marge doesn't understand this, but anytime Dickie does something I feel guilty.
Peter, I'm really sorry to put you through this. I just couldn't face going to the police by myself when my Italian's so rotten.
Don't be daft. It's fine. I'm delighted you finally made it to Venice. I'm delighted, contrary to rumour, you're still in one piece?
Don't be daft. It's fine. I'm delighted you finally made it to Venice. I'm delighted, contrary to rumour, you're still in one piece?
What rumour?
What rumour?
That Dickie murdered you and is travelling under your passport. I know, ridiculous.
Welcome to Venice. This place reeks, doesn't it? Can you smell it? Ugh. Sorry. Not the best way to spend your first day.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Anyway I've got to the bottom of the delay. Finally. We're waiting for someone from Rome.

I've been backpacking.
I don't know how to translate that. E difficile... il signor Ripley... dormiva all'aperto, con un...

Il signor Ripley ha una fidanzata, il signor Dickie ha una fidanzata e probabilmente il signor Freddie Miles ha molte fidanzate.
What did he say?
He says so many fiancées.
He wants to know if you killed Freddie Miles and then killed Dickie Greenleaf?
No I did not. I did not kill Freddie Miles and then kill Dickie Greenleaf. Is he accusing me? Ask him if he's accusing me!
No I did not. I did not kill Freddie Miles and then kill Dickie Greenleaf. Is he accusing me? Ask him if he's accusing me!
He's already angry, I don't think --
He's already angry, I don't think --
Just because he doesn't like Americans!
Can you imagine, if Dickie did kill Freddie, what must that be like? To wake up every morning, how can you? Just wake up and be a person, drink a coffee...?
Whatever you do, however terrible, however hurtful -- it all makes sense, doesn't it? Inside your head. You never meet anybody who thinks they're a bad person or that they're cruel.

Then you meet someone special and all you want to do is toss them the key, say open up, step inside, but you can't because it's dark and there are demons and if anybody saw how ugly it was...
I keep wanting to do that -- fling open the door -- let the light in, clean everything out. If I could get a huge eraser and rub everything out... starting with myself... the thing is, Peter, if...
No key, huh?
I'm sorry. I was asleep. I must have fallen asleep.
You look ghastly, Tom. Are you okay?
Not guilty.
I'll fix some drinks.
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
Do you want me to stick around?

You go. I don't want to get dressed yet. Come back though. Come back. You know, you look so relaxed, like a completely different person.
Well, that's entirely your fault. And, if I fall overboard, that'll be your fault too.

Good. But I think we should stay in here for the rest of the trip.

Dickie Greenleaf?
Yes?
Yes?
Inspector Roverini. Can we come in?
It's a terrible shock, eh? What time did Signor Miles leave yesterday?
I can't be absolutely sure -- 8? 9? We'd both taken on far too many drinks -- but it was dark, it was certainly dark when I walked him down to his car.

My scooter. I fell off. Getting chased by photographers.

Does he stay with you here?

No!

No. Here is a pattern. Two days ago Freddie Miles is dead -- he leaves your apartment and is murdered. Yesterday a little boat is found in San Remo full of rocks, and the owner tells the Police it was stolen on November 7th. We look at hotel records and we see oh! Dickie Greenleaf is staying in San Remo and then our boatman

Let her in, what's the difference? Let her in. No, actually, no, I'd like it very much if you would ask her to come back later.
Thank you.
May I ask... why would you speak to your friend and not your fiancée?
May I ask... why would you speak to your friend and not your fiancée?

You got a .44 Magnum?
That's an expensive gun.
That's an expensive gun.
I got money.
Some of these guns are like toys, but a Smith and Wesson, man, you can hit somebody over the head with it and it will still come back dead on. Nothing beats quality. You interested in an automatic?
I want a .32. Revolver. And a palm gun. That .22 there.
I want a .32. Revolver. And a palm gun. That .22 there.
That's the Colt .25 -- a fine little gun. Don't do a lot of damage, but it's as fast as the Devil. Handy little gun, you can carry it almost anywhere. I'll throw it in for another $125.
How much for everything.
The .32's $150 -- and you're really getting a good deal now -- and all together it comes to, ah, seven eighty- five for four pieces and a holster. Hell, I'll give you the holster, we'll make it seventy-five and you've got a deal -- a good one.

How much to get a permit to carry?
Well, you're talking big money now. I'd say at least five grand, maybe more, and it would take a while to check it out. The way things are going now $5.000 is probably low. You see, I try not to fool with the small-time crap. Too risky, too little bread. Say 6 G's, but if I get the permit it'll be as solid as

Sure, here, take this card, go to this place and give 'em the card. They'll charge you, but there won't be any hassle.
You in Nam? Can't help but notice your jacket?
Huh?
Huh?
Vietnam? I saw it on your jacket. Where were you? Bet you got to handle a lot of weapons out there.
Yeah. I was all around. One hospital, then the next.
It's hell out there all right. A real shit-eatin' war. I'll say this, though: It's bringing a lot of fantastic guns. The market's flooded. Colt automatics are all over.

They'd never get me to go back. They'd have to shoot me first. You got anything to carry these in?
You like ball games?

Yes, mam.
Well, that's not exactly what the Senator has proposed. You might not want to canvass, but there is plenty more other work we need done: Office work, filing, poster hanging.

If you don't mind, mam, I'd be mighty pleased if you'd go out and have some coffee and pie with me.
Why?
Well, Betsy mam, I drive by this place here in my taxi many times a day. And I watch you sitting here at this big long desk with these telephones, and I say to myself, that's a lonely girl. She needs a friend. And I'm gonna be her friend.
I don't know...
It's just to the corner, mam. In broad daytime. Nothing can happen. I'll be there to protect you.

We've signed up 15,000 Palantine volunteers in New York so far. The organizational problems are becoming just staggering.
I know what you mean. I've got the same problems. I just can't get things organized. Little things, I mean. Like my room, my possessions. I should get one of those signs that says, "One of these days I'm gonna get organezizied"
Travis, I never ever met anybody like you before.
I can believe that.

I had a regular job for a while, days. You know, doin' this, doin' that. But I didn't have anything to do at night. I got kinda lonely, you know, just wandering around. So I decided to works nights. It ain't good to be alone, you know.

The full moon. One night I had three or four weirdos in a row and I looked up and, sure enough, there it was -- the full moon.
Com'on, Travis. It's not that bad. I take lots of taxis.

No. It was you. You had some manila folders and a pink bag from Saks.
You're right! Now I remember! It was after the Western regional planners were in town and the meeting went late. The next day I was completely bushed. It was unbelievable.
If it wasn't for a drunk I would have picked you up. He wanted to go to the DMZ.
If it wasn't for a drunk I would have picked you up. He wanted to go to the DMZ.

I didn't mean you. But just ordinary people. A guy I know -- Dough-Boy -- met his wife that way. They got to talking. She said she usually caught the bus so he started picking her up at the bus stop, taking her home with the flag up.

Well, no... not really... had some famous people in the cab. I got this guy who makes lasers. Not regular lasers, not the big kind. Little lasers, pocket sized, small enough to clip your belt like a transistor radio, like a gun, you know. Like a ray gun. Zap.

Yes. It won't be long now. Seventeen days.
Well, I hope he wins.
How are you, Travis? I read about you in the papers.
Oh, I got over that. It was nothing, really. The papers always blow these things up. A little stiffness. That'll go away. I just sleep more, that's all.
No, no, please. This fare's on me. Please.
Thank you, Travis.
Travis?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Maybe I'll see you again sometime, huh?

Tom, come here a moment. I think this canvas report is about ready to go out. Check it out with Andy, and if he okays if, have a copy made for the campaign headquarters in every county. And don't forget to add the new photo releases.
The senator's white paper is almost ready, Bets. Should we wait for that?

Come on, Delly, look at the country today. We're fighting communists in Korea, we're paranoid about the Russians, we've got this thing with the Rosenbergs and the atomic bomb... You think they want "suspected communists" entertaining the American public with party propaganda like, gosh I don't know, "Sand Pirates of the Sahara?"

You'll stand by me?
Whatever happens.
You've got everything?
Yeah. Except a chance in hell of coming out of this intact.

Delly... thanks, thank you. I'll take good care of this.
Just remember two things. First, the law is a living thing. It made us free and it keeps us free. Sometimes it gets twisted around by people for their own purposes. Sometimes it makes mistakes, sometimes big mistakes. But in the end, the law prevails for the just. Sometimes, it takes a while.

Okay. What's the second thing?
Tell them Pete. Tell them...
Mr. Chairman, as I understand it, the Fifth Amendment pertains to self-incrimination, and I can't incriminate myself because I've done nothing wrong. Besides, incrimination is why you have Mr. Clyde working for you.
I see you got the telegram.
Pete, I'm so sorry about what they did to you. I didn't think you'd come back, I thought you'd want to write again...
Pete, I'm so sorry about what they did to you. I didn't think you'd come back, I thought you'd want to write again...
Dell, I can't write unless I'm happy, and I can't be happy unless I'm here -- and with you. This is me, Delly. Pete Appleton. And I love you!
Dell, I can't write unless I'm happy, and I can't be happy unless I'm here -- and with you. This is me, Delly. Pete Appleton. And I love you!
And I love you, Pete!
Dad?
Delly? In here.
How'd it go?
Not as bad as I thought it would. I think I passed.
Not as bad as I thought it would. I think I passed.
That's my girl! Did you...?
That's my girl! Did you...?
No hiccups, which was good. Who wants an attorney who gets the hiccups when she gets nervous? "Your honor, I object!"
I think it's worse now.
That always used to work.
That always used to work.
Yeah, well it's not everyday you get news like this. You're sure he's okay? Other than the bump on the head?
Yeah, well it's not everyday you get news like this. You're sure he's okay? Other than the bump on the head?
Well...
Well...
Dad...
He doesn't remember anything, Delly. Doesn't know how he got here, doesn't remember his father, the town, the Bijou, anyone...
... including me. Right?
... including me. Right?
I'm afraid not. He looked right at your picture without batting an eye. But it's probably temporary. He got all the way to Lawson, so he clearly knew who he was and what he was doing until he hit his head. I'm sure it'll all come back to him. It just takes a catalyst.

You mean, me?
You mean, me?
It's possible.
Daddy, that's Luke, can you let him in? I'll be right down.
Honey, I... I can't... it's the...
Besides, Daddy's still trying to figure out how to get his new television set working.
I had it, a minute ago...
Do you... remember me?
I've seen you before. Your picture...
What.
No, I... I just wondering where you've been all this time.
No, I... I just wondering where you've been all this time.
Me too.
Me too.
You look... different.
You look... different.
I do?
I do?
Yeah, a little. I think you grew an inch or so. And you've lost weight.
Yeah, a little. I think you grew an inch or so. And you've lost weight.
I did? Huh!
You can all go home, now. He's not going anywhere.
Go on home, folks. And thanks for the welcome.
Then why do I feel like we're still being shadowed?
Well... where can we go?
City hall?
You must not remember anything. Come on.
You first.
Why me?
Why me?
Be a gentleman. You have to help me down.
Of course, there was a lot more room before they stuck the memorial down here.
How'd they get it inside?
How'd they get it inside?
Through the door. It comes apart.
Right here. "Albert Lucas Trumbo." And all the others. I knew them all. So did you. We went to school with most of them.
It doesn't seem right, this being down here. It ought to be where people can see it.
It doesn't seem right, this being down here. It ought to be where people can see it.
After they commissioned it, no one could ever agree on where to put it. The Methodists wanted it in front of the Methodist Church, the Presbyterians wanted it in front of the Presbyterian Church, the city council wanted it in the lobby of City Hall. Everyone finally got tired of the fighting. So they stuck it down here.
So, you're really gonna be a lawyer?
And why not?
And why not?
Whoa.
Whoa.
Sorry. You don't know how many times I've heard that. "A lady lawyer? Are you crazy?" Like a woman couldn't be as good a lawyer as a man. Or better, in fact.
Sorry. You don't know how many times I've heard that. "A lady lawyer? Are you crazy?" Like a woman couldn't be as good a lawyer as a man. Or better, in fact.
Have you always wanted to be a lawyer?

You... don't remember, but yes, ever since I was a little girl.

What did... what did I want to be?
What did... what did I want to be?
Oh, well... I guess you... in high school, you were a pretty good first baseman. And we were on the debate team together. But... I think you were gonna run the Bijou. You were brought up there, and you loved it so much. And I think you knew how much the town needed a place like that.
You don't have a boyfriend or anyone... you know... like that?
Actually, I was married. For four years. But... well, we didn't fit together. I'm divorced now.
Actually, I was married. For four years. But... well, we didn't fit together. I'm divorced now.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
No, it's okay. See, when two people belong together, the other person should be the... the key that unlocks the rest of you... I'm not making sense, am I?
No, it's okay. See, when two people belong together, the other person should be the... the key that unlocks the rest of you... I'm not making sense, am I?
No, you are. I know exactly what you mean. It's not that you're missing something. It's that the other person gives something to you... that you had all the time. You just didn't see it until they came along.
No, you are. I know exactly what you mean. It's not that you're missing something. It's that the other person gives something to you... that you had all the time. You just didn't see it until they came along.
Yeah...
We were in love... weren't we?
Yes. Hic!
What was that?
Nothing.
Nothing.
Do you have the...
Do you have the...
I'm fine. Really.
Were we going to get married?
Eventually. We were going to be engaged... when you came back from overseas...
No... you were wearing that suit the last time we went out before...
Oh...
Oh...
... and It's just... well, deja vu.
This is strange. Do you feel it?
What?
What?
We've done this before, so many times. The last time was so long ago, but it feels like yesterday.
We've done this before, so many times. The last time was so long ago, but it feels like yesterday.
Oh.
You know, everyone's so excited about the Bijou re-opening...
It's gonna cost over nine hundred dollars to open the place, Delly.

Nine hundred...
Nine hundred...
Yeah, and needless to say, none of us has that kind of money lying around.
Yeah, and needless to say, none of us has that kind of money lying around.
What about a loan? You could go to the bank...?
What about a loan? You could go to the bank...?
A loan to a man who ran his business into the ground and his son who can't account for the last nine-and-a-half years of his life? Not likely.

Have you got a cigarette?
When did you start smoking?
I don't smoke?
I don't smoke?
You tried to once. It was pretty pitiful.

Oh.
They're not bad.
No, they're not. I'd say your investment was paying dividends.

My what?
My what?
Back in '37, you heard Benny Goodman play for the first time, so you went out and got a used clarinet. You wanted nothing more than to be able to play like him. You tried hard, but it wasn't long before it was clear that Benny Goodman would never be looking over his shoulder. So you gave the clarinet to Spencer.

Huh. That was nice of me.

You had a hidden agenda, though. See, when he was five or six, little Spence used to follow you around like a puppy. Bothered the hell out of you. But as soon as you gave him the clarinet...

Now, did you remember that, or...
Nope. Just filling in the blanks.

Oh. Okay.
How do you tell those two apart, anyway?
Alex and Charlie? Simple. Alex is the smarter one.

That's... pretty frightening.
Your dancing's very good.
Thanks.

It never used to be. You were two left feet on the dance floor. Like pulling teeth to get you to do a little box step.

Guess I must've learned.
What... do you remember?
Well... everything. It started coming back a couple of days ago. I remember everything now.

I see...

Delly. I'm... I'm not... Harry wasn't my father. And I'm not... I'm not Luke.
Delly, shhhhhh...
No... I can't... I have to... I can't...
Sir, that is true.
Mr. Appleton, do you know an "Albert Lucas Trumbo?"
Mr. Appleton, do you know an "Albert Lucas Trumbo?"
Luke Trumbo? We never met. But I'd like to think I know him.
Luke Trumbo? We never met. But I'd like to think I know him.
Is that because you were masquerading as Luke Trumbo while you were in Lawson?
Is that because you were masquerading as Luke Trumbo while you were in Lawson?
Mr. Clyde you're twisting things around. I wasn't masquerading. Luke Trumbo... Luke was a good man who gave his life for his country. I just... happen to look a little bit like him. That's all.
Mr. Clyde you're twisting things around. I wasn't masquerading. Luke Trumbo... Luke was a good man who gave his life for his country. I just... happen to look a little bit like him. That's all.
Yes, I see that Private Trumbo was reported missing in action and is presumed dead. I also see that you were posted stateside during the war. Fort Dix?
Yes, I see that Private Trumbo was reported missing in action and is presumed dead. I also see that you were posted stateside during the war. Fort Dix?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Well, I'm sure we're all glad to see you came through it all right.
Now, I see that you've been running a movie theater in Lawson called "The Bijou," is that also true?
Yes sir. But I didn't go to Lawson to run The Bijou, that was... that was something that just happened. You see, I was involved in an accident in Lawson, and I spent some time recovering there.
Anyone who reads the newspaper is quite familiar with your... "accident," Mr. Appleton. An accident which, conveniently, came hard upon your dismissal from United Pictures. Tell us, this "accident" of yours, are we given to understand that it affected your memory?
Yes.
Yes.
And what is the state of your memory now?
Sir, are you referring to the fact that I was suffering from amnesia, and I've since recovered my memory?
I'm interested in knowing if you remember things you did in your past, or if they've been conveniently "blotted out" as a result of your "accident."

Mr. Clyde, I remember everything.
Mr. Clyde, I remember everything.
Good. Good. Now, I hold in my hand a photostatic copy of the attendance roster for the "Bread Instead of Bullets Club" of the University of California, Los Angeles, dated October 11, 1935. A copy of this paper is before you, Mr. Appleton. Do you recognize it?
Yes... yes, I do.
Referring to line thirty-seven of the document, does your printed name and signature appear there?

Mr. Appleton, please tell this committee what was the nature and purpose of the "Bread Instead of Bullets Club?"

Mr. Clyde, do you want to know what I knew then, or do you want to know what I know now? They're two different things?

Start with what you knew then.

Well, I'd direct the attention of counsel and committee to line thirty-six of the document, and the name printed and signed there.

We see it. For the record, it reads "Lucille Angstrom." What's the point of this?
We see it. For the record, it reads "Lucille Angstrom." What's the point of this?
Well, that's what I knew then. Or who I knew, I should say. You see, I was trying to court Miss Angstrom. I went to the meeting to impress her.

Are you asking this committee to believe that you attended a meeting of a communist party front organization in order to impress a girl?
Are you asking this committee to believe that you attended a meeting of a communist party front organization in order to impress a girl?
Well, if you'd seen Miss Angstrom...
All right, Mr. Appleton. That was what you knew then. What do you know now?
Well, I know that I lost my job because of one meeting I went to when I was a kid in college. I know that I've been branded a communist, which I'm not, but even if I was, it shouldn't matter, or what do we have a Bill Of Rights for?

Mr. Chairman, the witness is being non-responsive...
Are you now, or have you ever been, a member of the communist party?
No, sir.
No, sir.
Are you refuting this evidence and your previous testimony?
Are you refuting this evidence and your previous testimony?
I'm not refuting anything.
I'm not refuting anything.
Yet you're contradicting yourself. You earlier testified that you attended a meeting of a communist party-run organization, yet you just said, under oath, that you were not now -- nor ever -- a member of the communist party.

Well, then, as what did you go?
Do you swear that the testimony you are about to give before this committee of the United States House of Representatives will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you god?
I do.

Now, we're informed that you have a statement you'd like to read, is that correct?
A statement?
Yes. A prepared statement.
Um... no. I don't have a statement at this time.
I'm a little hesitant to say.
The witness need not be hesitant to say anything before this committee, as long as it's the truth.
Mr. Appleton, you are making light of a legally constituted committee of the United States Congress. Believe you me, you do not want to incur our wrath.
I'm sorry, sir, I have no intention of making light of this committee. And I have no intention of incurring your wrath, Mr. Chairman. I have a few friends who have already incurred your wrath. They've sent me letters from jail.
Mr. Appleton? Mr. Appleton?
I... I need a drink of water.
I... I need a drink of water.
Go ahead, son.
Mr. Chairman... there's... another Amendment... that I'd like to invoke at this time, but it's not the Fifth Amendment. I wonder if you're familiar with it.
Mr. Appleton, you will...
Cecil! Cecil, there's a young man in there...
Lord love a duck, Harry, you wanna give me a heart attack right in front of the doctor's office?

Listen to me! The young man in there...
Only one in town. Get in, son.
Ben, when's Delly due back?
Here we are.
Well, son, you're home!
Thanks for the lift, Cecil.
Don't mention it. Welcome home, Luke.
No wallet, huh?
No identification at all. What're you thinkin', Cecil?
No identification at all. What're you thinkin', Cecil?
What I'm thinkin' is we got us one a'two things here. A mystery or a damn miracle. And by god I can't tell which. Boy, you say you have no idea who you are? That right?
Doc, with your permission, I want to bring someone in here. Maybe it'll jar this young man's memory.
By all means.
Are you saying that he's...
Shhhhhh.
Mother o'god...
Give the man a hug, boy! That's your father!
Tomorrow afternoon... ... oh my god...
Exactly. Break it to her gently.
Yes.
You ever been in this town before, to your knowledge?

The Jimmy Stewart picture? I remember that one. Saw it over at the Bijou. So, you remember that, huh?

Or the Bijou. Either one.

I remember the picture... but I don't remember where I saw it.
C'mon, I'll give you two a lift back to the Bijou.
The Bijou?
Well, no, but these gentlemen would like to get some answers...
I don't know what else to tell you. I wasn't hiding out. I hit my head and I didn't remember anything until a few days ago.
Luke, you probably don't remember me, Roscoe Fitts, I'm the grocer here in town.
Good to meet you. Again.
Good to meet you. Again.
Like Ernie said, we're all glad to have you back.
Like Ernie said, we're all glad to have you back.
Thanks.

And I hear you and Harry are planning on re-opening the Bijou.

I can only imagine. You know, I spoke with your Dad last year about maybe taking the Bijou off his hands. I don't think he gave it very much thought.

Well, he loves the place. It's his home.
Well, he loves the place. It's his home.
Luke, I'm hopping you can help him see the reality of the situation. I'll come to the point. I want to buy the property, and I'm prepared to offer six-thousand dollars for it. And that's just for the property, mind you. If you want, I'll leave it to you and your father to dismantle and liquidate the building for whatever salvage value it has,

The days of the storefront grocery are numbered. I plan on putting up a free-standing supermarket.
The days of the storefront grocery are numbered. I plan on putting up a free-standing supermarket.
A super market. Huh.
A super market. Huh.
You think it over. No reason to risk financial ruin for the sake of a crumbling old building.
So... you do intend to fix the place up after all?
Mr. Fitts, with all due respect, I think Lawson needs the Bijou a bit more than it needs a super market. And I think Lawson deserves the Bijou. There's not a lot that can be done to help us get past the pain we've all felt...
Excuse me... what's your, um, your name?
Harry, son. Harry.
Harry, son. Harry.
And... what's my name again?
And... what's my name again?
Albert Lucas Trumbo. But you've been "Luke" since you were a baby.
Albert Lucas Trumbo. But you've been "Luke" since you were a baby.
Ah. Luke. Luke. I like it.
You never came back from the war. We were told you were missing and presumed dead.
When did I leave?
When did I leave?
You joined up one month to the day after Pearl Harbor. January seventh... nineteen forty-two.
Nine and-a-half years ago.
Nine and-a-half years...
Wait'll you see the inside!
Can't wait.
We've been closed for a while.
Ah.
Exactly how long has the Bijou been closed?
Hmmmm... after you left, it was difficult, and then Lily -- that's your mother -- she took ill and died... we haven't shown a picture since forty-eight.
Hmmmm... after you left, it was difficult, and then Lily -- that's your mother -- she took ill and died... we haven't shown a picture since forty-eight.
Why?
Why?
Well, after the war, with so many of the town's boys killed, people around here didn't much feel like going to the movies, I guess. Some of 'em moved away -- Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Francisco. Wasn't much to keep 'em here, I expect. And now with this "television" thing -- people just aren't going out as much as they used to.

Didn't you have any help?
Didn't you have any help?
Oh, I had Irene and Old Tim but they really couldn't help much. Broke their hearts when we closed up. Broke mine, too. But now that you're back, well, things will be different around here, that's for sure. C'mon, I'll show you where we live.
That's Lily. Your mother, rest her soul.
Mother. She's beautiful.
Mother. She's beautiful.
Well, yes, that she was. She certainly made this place a home.
They couldn't wait to see you.
Who... are they?
Who... are they?
This is the staff of the Bijou.
This is the staff of the Bijou.
Oh. What... what time is it?
Oh. What... what time is it?
Six-thirty. I thought we'd get an early start.
I promised him a new uniform when we re-opened. And you'll get one, too.
You know, I hate to bring this up, but screens and uniforms and paint and repairs are going to take money, which I'm willing to bet none of us has.
Um... Harry? Did I ever keep the books here?
No, your mother did, then I did after she passed.
No, your mother did, then I did after she passed.
Well, I'm the first one to admit that I don't know anything about bookkeeping, but there are some very interesting things in here.

Yes?

Forty-two was a lean year around here. The war had just started... you were gone less than a month... and we were coming off a bit of a drought as I recall. Not everyone could ante up the price of a ticket, and a chicken's as good as money if you ask me. At that time, it meant a lot to the folks around

Yeah, I know, but poultry...?
I know it's hard to believe, son, but this place, this little place this wasn't a theater then, this was a palace! Any man, woman, child, you, me, it didn't matter, you bought your ticket and you walked in and you...
But I...
Son, I think you loved the Bijou even more than I did. You've got to remember that. You've got to.
Ernie.
... Ernie.
Carl. Friend of yours from high school. Everybody calls him "Cueball."
Oh, hi Cue... Carl. Sorry.
I'll be home in a little while, Harry. Don't wait up.
You two have a lot of catching up to do, I guess.
You two have a lot of catching up to do, I guess.
You bet.
You bet.
Goodnight, son. 'Night, Delly.
Well...
Yes?
Yes?
Between a new screen, paint, plumbing for the concession stand, and about a hundred other repairs around the theater... it's going to cost at least nine hundred dollars to get the Bijou into shape to open up.
And you have sixty-eight dollars and thirty-seven cents in the bank. Your only source of income are my veteran's death benefit of forty dollars a month, to which you're no longer entitled since I'm alive, and these ten dollar a month cash deposits you make. What are those?
They're...
Why don't you two get out there and dance?
Oh, no, I...
Beautiful, wasn't it?
Yes.
Yes.

Vultures...
I'm not happy about this, mind you, but if I have to go, at least I'm going in my own bed, the same bed my Lily died in, and... knowing that my son is alive. That's not too shabby, is it?
You're not going anywhere, Harry.
You're not going anywhere, Harry.
Don't tell me, I know about these things. I've seen it before. It's all right. It's... all right. You're here. Oh, God, I love you, son.
Pete. You think maybe you've had enough?
Bought the bottle, didn't I? To the United States of America. Long my she wave.
Thanks, Jerry. Tell me something.
What.
What.
You tight with J. Edgar Hoover?

The G-man?

Pete, if J. Edgar Hoover walked in here wearing a dress, I wouldn't know him.

Too bad. He says I'm a communist.

You should watch what you say. You don't know who's listening.

Sure, I suppose. That why you're on a bender?
Sure, I suppose. That why you're on a bender?
This is not a bender yet. This is the start of a bender. But I can see how you were confused, they look a lot alike.
Pete... go home. Come on, I'll call that girlfriend of yours, what's her name... Sandy?
Sandra Sinclair.
Sandra Sinclair.
Gimmee her number, I'll have her pick you up.
Gimmee her number, I'll have her pick you up.
Sandra Sinclair. Wanna know her real name? Bella Iskowitz. No one's who they really are, Jer. Everyone's someone else. Even you. Even me. Especially me. I'm Peter Appleton, the communist who's not really a communist.

I wanna close up soon. C'mon, let's call her.
Nope. Can't. We're through.
Then I'll call you a cab.
Then I'll call you a cab.
I'll save you the trouble. I'm a cab. There. Did it myself.
'Sides, car's right outside. I'll be seein' ya, Jer.
Pete...
Any idea how you got here, son?
No, sir.
Been drinkin' a bit, have we?
I don't remember. I guess so. Smells like it. Tastes like it.
I don't remember. I guess so. Smells like it. Tastes like it.
Well, you've been wet to the skin. You must've fallen in.

Lucky you got out, that water's got quite a pull, and it empties straight into the ocean.
Here, one of mine.
Thanks.
Do you remember if you were driving a car? Maybe you went over the bridge. No guard rail there, it's easy to do. It's happened before.
It's possible. I just don't remember.
It's possible. I just don't remember.
And you don't know your name or who you are, that right?
And you don't know your name or who you are, that right?
I... no, I... I just can't...
I... no, I... I just can't...
It's okay, son. We just need to call you something. That's all.
What is it?
Call me... Ishmael?
Call me... Ishmael?
Well, at least you remember "Moby Dick."
That's me and my daughter Adele. My pride and joy. Charms the fish right out of the lake, she does.
She's very pretty.
She's very pretty.
Thanks. Well, Sheriff's on his way over, and maybe we can get to the bottom of who you are...
... sorry 'bout that, but you do look familiar to me.
Wish I could say the same thing.
That's where you live.
We live in a theater?
Evening, Luke.
Evening, Doctor Lardner.
What's wrong?
Uh, no... just seeing you standing there, it reminded me... there's a word for it...
Uh, no... just seeing you standing there, it reminded me... there's a word for it...
Oh, you mean the suit. Harry kept all my old clothes. Fits okay, but it's a little big.
You kids off to the dance?
Aren't you coming?
Aren't you coming?
No, I'm not much of a dancer.
It's a pretty massive heart attack. His lungs have filled with fluid, and, well... it seems as though his body is just... shutting down.
Can we get him to the hospital?
Can we get him to the hospital?
Even if we could, and the move didn't kill him, there'd be very little we could do there that we can't do here. I'm sorry.
You smell gas?
Don't smell nothin'. He must not be dead in here.
Don't smell nothin'. He must not be dead in here.
Jesus.
Jesus.
Hey, it's the best way to tell.
You think he's drunk somewhere?
Wouldn't blame him if he was.

Well, his rent's past due and he said to call you in case of an emergency. He lose his job or somethin'?
Well, his rent's past due and he said to call you in case of an emergency. He lose his job or somethin'?
What's his rent?
What's his rent?
Thirty a month.
Here's three months rent, and a ten spot for no more questions and to keep an eye on his place. Now, I need a moment alone.
Huh?
Huh?
Take a hike. Am-scray.
Take a hike. Am-scray.
Huh? Oh, sure. Just pull the door shut when you leave.
Peter, their hands are tied. You see that, don't you?
I... I don't believe this.

Are you saying it's a mistake, that you didn't go to any meetings? They say you did.

No. Yeah... I... I don't know. Maybe I did. Leo, this was before Pearl Harbor. I was in college. It was a bunch of kids, and I was just one of 'em. I didn't believe in what they were saying. Hell, I didn't even know what they were saying!

So, you're saying that it's true. You went to a meeting of a known communist organization.
So, you're saying that it's true. You went to a meeting of a known communist organization.
Leo, I was trying to impress a skirt. You know me, I'm non- political. Republican, Democrat, Communist, there's not a dime's worth of difference between 'em anyway.

Leo, you're my agent. Tell "them" to take a flyin' piss. I didn't do anything wrong. I fought in the war, for crissakes!

You broke your arm. You were coming out of a bar. You were drunk.

At least I was on our side! Look, they want me to testify? I'll testify. I'll tell 'em anything they want to hear! Jesus, Leo, this is my career!

You can't testify.
You can't testify.
Why not?
They don't want you to testify because you're not a big enough fish for them. They just don't want you writing pictures for now. That's all.
Yeah, well, that's enough.
Yeah, well, that's enough.
Peter, I believe in you. More to the point, I read your new script... um...
Peter, I believe in you. More to the point, I read your new script... um...
"Ashes To Ashes?"
"Ashes To Ashes?"
That's the one, "Ashes To Ashes." I think it's great. But it'll never get made with this communist business hanging over your head. You can't work until you're cleared -- and believe me, starting right now, I'm gonna do everything I can to make that happen.

So, it is a blacklist.
So, it is a blacklist.
Don't say that. There is no such thing as a blacklist. Now, are you gonna play ball?
Don't say that. There is no such thing as a blacklist. Now, are you gonna play ball?
Yes. Leo, goddammit... this isn't fair!
The FBI can't arrest you, because you haven't done anything wrong.
Well, that's a relief. I understand they usually don't let that stop them.
Well, that's a relief. I understand they usually don't let that stop them.
However... you're gonna be subpoenaed to testify before the Un-American Activities Committee when they open hearings in Los Angeles. Now, if you play ball and tell them what they want to hear, they'll clear you.

And I won't be a communist anymore.
And I won't be a communist anymore.
Exactly.
Exactly.
So it doesn't make any difference that I'm not one now, and have never been one.
Next time, it might be the FBI. The time after that, it might be the President. But it'll always be someone. Count on it.
That's not the country Luke fought for.

Lest we forget, Peter, your own military career was somewhat less illustrious than Luke's.

It's wrong, Leo.
It's wrong, Leo.
Peter, don't let that stop you all of a sudden.
That was quite a show you gave them today. We shoulda sold tickets.
I'm not sorry for what I said.
I'm not sorry for what I said.
No, of course not, why should you be sorry? You're the new Peter Appleton. You exercised your rights as a solid citizen, first amendment, freedom of speech, all that. Very noble.
Cigarette?
No thanks.
When'd you quit smoking?
Luke didn't smoke.
Luke didn't smoke.
Oh, I see. But you're not Luke. You're Peter Appleton, the picture writer.
Oh, I see. But you're not Luke. You're Peter Appleton, the picture writer.
Not any more.

Why not?

Leo, you were in there, you saw what I did. You think they're gonna let me write pictures? Hell, they're probably gonna throw my ass in jail.
Leo, you were in there, you saw what I did. You think they're gonna let me write pictures? Hell, they're probably gonna throw my ass in jail.
Not at all.

Besides, I don't even know if I want to write anymore.
Besides, I don't even know if I want to write anymore.
What, you're going to go back to that hick town and run the projector and marry the doctor's daughter?
Peter, I'm an agent. I buy lunches and get deals made for guys like you. That's what I do. You're a writer. You write pictures. That's what you do. And trust me, you'll be back doing it again tomorrow morning.
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
Kid, you gave them what they wanted. This committee, it feeds on names. The more names, the better. But for some high-profile witnesses, like yourself, any name will do.

What, all of a sudden, "Lucille Angstrom" isn't a name?
Her name was right there in front of them. They gave it to me, I didn't give it to them.
Well, that's not what they think.
Well, that's not what they think.
Leo, she was... she was a girl I knew in college...
Leo, she was... she was a girl I knew in college...
You should keep track of your old school chums. Turns out she eventually joined the communist party. On top of which, she's Lucy Angstrom Hirschfeld now, and she happens to be a writer for "Studio One" on CBS.

Oh god, oh, god, no, I...
Oh god, oh, god, no, I...
So, our lawyers had a talk with the Committee's lawyers. That Elvin Clyde fella won't be too happy about it, but we cut a deal. They cleared you -- and they're gonna thank you publicly for your testimony purging yourself.

Thank me publicly? For what? For ruining this woman's life?
Thank me publicly? For what? For ruining this woman's life?
Climb down off your cross. They already knew about her. She was subpoenaed six months ago! Who the hell do you think named you?
I haven't danced with another man since Mr. Terwilliger passed.
When was that?
When was that?
Nineteen-oh-nine.
That was beautiful.
I taught you that.
I taught you that.
I can play the piano?
I can play the piano?
Oh dear, yes. You were an excellent student, before all that clarinet nonsense. You loved Chopin. You used to call it "heaven music." "Teach me some heaven music," you used to say.
Sit. Play with me.
No, I...
No, I...
Some of it might come back to you.
Luke! Luke, something's wrong! The film broke, and I can't raise Harry on the house phone!
What?
What?
You've got to talk to them before they tear the theater apart!
Is there a young Tim?
No.
No.
Well, then, why do they call you "Old Tim?"
Found me.
Yeah. I hope you don't mind. I didn't know anyone lived here... well, besides Harry. And me.
So I guess this fellow belongs to you. What's his name?
Cat.
Cat.
Cat. That's simple. I like it. Hi, Cat.
Cat. That's simple. I like it. Hi, Cat.
We thought you was dead, you know. It's okay that I live here?
We thought you was dead, you know. It's okay that I live here?
Of course.
T-t-thank you. Thank you. I... I always... I always wanted to wear my uniform from the Great War, but your daddy, he always said no, that's not an usher's u-u-uniform, that's an army uniform and the Bijou, she's not the army. They give me a medal, but I lost it in the h-h-hospital. I forget things sometimes. Since the w-w-war.
Yeah... me too.
That's my r-r-rent.
Oh.
Can I... Can I t-t-talk to you?
Sure. Come on in. I was just packing.
Please, sit.
Thanks.
They'll come back, you know. They'll all c-c-come back.
The customers? I don't know...
The customers? I don't know...
They will. They w-w-will.
Tim, I have to tell you something.
Oh.
Oh.
It's about me.
It's about me.
Oh.
I'm... I'm not Luke. Luke is dead. He died in the war. He's not coming back, and I'm not him. I don't even belong here. This whole thing started out as an accident, and that's all it is. An accident.
Oh...
Oh...
My name isn't Luke. It's Peter. Peter Appleton.
Did you think I didn't kn-kn-know that?
I thought you...
I thought you...
I know more than you give me c-c- credit, that's for sure. Don't you see, it don't m-m-matter who you are? All that matters is what you g-g-gave us. And you can't take that away now. You're wrong, Peter Appleton. You do belong here.
Pete, there's time before the picture starts, you want to get some popcorn?
You bet, honey.
What happened?
What exactly did you hear?
What exactly did you hear?
That you got let go.
That you got let go.
I wasn't alone. Wasn't Frankie Ruskin directing the picture you're in?

He was, but he got sick. We got a new director today. Why?

You mean, he was... let go, too?

They're saying I'm a communist, Sandy. But I'm not, you know that. I'm gonna fight 'em, and I'm gonna win, but I'll need your help.
Will you help me, Sandy?
I'll have to think about this. I have to get back... I should go...
Ancestors?
Actually, my grandpap. But "ancestors" sounds better, don't it? Here.
I suppose. Thanks.
You look familiar, fella. What's your name?
They all know you?
'Course they all know me. And I know all them. Town's got my name, don't it?
Ernie Cole here just got himself elected mayor. Lost both his boys in the war. Kenny at Anzio and Willie at Normandy.
The war...
The war...
Mabel over there at the diner lost her husband Max. Okinawa, I believe.
You hungry, son?
Yes. Very.
Yes. Very.
Got any money?
Said as much myself, Doc. Can't place him, though. To look at him, you'd think the cheese slid off his cracker. Well, morning's half-over. I'm off.
Thank you, Mr. Lawson.
Thank you, Mr. Lawson.
Don't mention it. Whoever-you-are.
Now that you remember who you are, were you planning on telling anyone your true identity?
I already have.
I already have.
Who?
Who?
My girlfriend. If she still is...
My girlfriend. If she still is...
Would that be Miss Sinclair?
Would that be Miss Sinclair?
No. No, not Miss Sinclair. I'm talking about Adele Lardner.
Mr. Appleton, I have reason to believe you're holding something back, and that just rubs me the wrong way. Sir, are you a communist?
No. Absolutely not.
No. Absolutely not.
All right. All right. We'll see.
Miss Hayworth?
Yes?
Yes?
I'm Melanie Daniels. I'm sorry to bother you, but...
Yes?

They seemed sure it was either Alice or Lois.
They seemed sure it was either Alice or Lois.
Which is why the mail in this town never gets delivered to the right place. Did you want to see Cathy about something?
Are you a friend of Mitch's?
No, not really.
I've been wanting a cigarette for the past twenty minutes, but I couldn't convince myself to stop. This 'tilling of the soil' can get a little compulsive, you know.
It's a lovely garden.
It's a lovely garden.
Thank you. It gives me something to do with my spare time. There's a lot of spare time in Bodega Bay. Did you plan on staying long?

Well... something like that. I'm sorry. I don't mean to sound so mysterious.
Well... something like that. I'm sorry. I don't mean to sound so mysterious.
Actually, it's none of my business.
Did you drive up from San Francisco?
Yes.
Yes.
It's a nice drive. Is that where you met Mitch?
It's a nice drive. Is that where you met Mitch?
Yes.
Yes.
I guess that's where everyone meets him.
Do I? No, I'm an open book, I'm afraid. Or maybe a closed one. Pretty. What are they?
Lovebirds.
Mmm. Well, good luck, Miss Daniels.
Thank you.
Oh, hi! Did you find her all right?
Yes, I did.
I was wondering...
Yes?
Yes?
That sign. Do you think I could have the room for a single night?

I would appreciate it. I've tried everywhere in town, and they're all full.
I would appreciate it. I've tried everywhere in town, and they're all full.
Sure. You can have it. Where's your bag? In the car?
It's utilitarian, I'll say that for it.
I just picked up some things for the night at the general store. You see, I hadn't planned on spending much time here.
I just picked up some things for the night at the general store. You see, I hadn't planned on spending much time here.
Yes, I know. Did something unexpected crop up?
Miss Daniels? Is that you?
Yes.
Hi. Is something wrong? Is that cut beginning to bother you?
No, it's not the cut that's bothering me.
No, it's not the cut that's bothering me.
Would you like some brandy?
Would you like some brandy?
If you have some, I'd...
If you have some, I'd...
I'll get it, sit down, Miss Daniels. Do you want a sweater or something? A quilt?
No, thank you. Won't you call me Melanie?
All right.
Thank you.
It gets a little chilly here at night sometimes. Especially if you're over near the bay.
Or would you rather I changed the subject?
I think so.
I think so.
How do you like our little hamlet?

I despise it.

Well, I don't suppose it offers much to the casual visitor. Unless you're thrilled by a collection of shacks on a hillside. It takes a while to get used to.

Then maybe it isn't different at all. You know, her attitude nearly drove me crazy. I simply couldn't understand it.

When I got back to San Francisco I spent days trying to figure out just what I'd done to displease her.
When I got back to San Francisco I spent days trying to figure out just what I'd done to displease her.
And what had you done?
And what had you done?
Nothing! I simply existed. So what was the answer? A jealous woman, right? A clinging possessive mother. Wrong. With all due respect to Oedipus, I don't think that was the case at all.

So it ended. Not immediately, of course. I went back to San Francisco, and I still saw Mitch every now and then... but we both knew it was finished.

Then what are you doing here in Bodega Bay?

You get straight to the point, don't you?

I'm sorry. Forgive me.
I'm sorry. Forgive me.
No, that's all right, I don't mind. I came up here for two reasons. To begin with, I was bored with my job in San Francisco. I was teaching at a private school there... well, you know, you probably went to one yourself.

I did.
I did.
Then you know. Little girls in brown beanies. Deadly. Here I have a life. I'll go into that classroom on Monday morning, and I'll look out at twenty- five upturned little faces, and each of them will be saying, 'Yes, please give me what you have.' And I'll give them what I have. I haven't got very much, but I'll give them every ounce

And the second?
And the second?
I wanted to be near Mitch. It was over, and I knew it, but I wanted to be near him, anyway. You see, I still like him a hell of a lot. That's rare, I think. I don't want to lose his friendship... ever.
He wants me to go to Cathy's party tomorrow afternoon. I said I would.
I'll be going, too, to help out. It should be fun, Melanie.
I'll be going, too, to help out. It should be fun, Melanie.
It seems so pointless. I think I'll go to sleep. This has been a busy day. My luggage.
Do you think I should go?
That's up to you.
That's up to you.
It's really up to Lydia, isn't it?
It's really up to Lydia, isn't it?
Never mind Lydia. Do you want to go?
Never mind Lydia. Do you want to go?
Yes.
Yes.
Then go.
Is anyone there?
Look.
Look.
Ohhh. Oh, the poor thing. He probably lost his way in the dark.
He got a call from Dan Fawcett a little while ago. His chickens won't eat, either.
It's what you said, Mom. Mr. Brinkmeyer's feed is no good.
It's what you said, Mom. Mr. Brinkmeyer's feed is no good.
No, Cathy. He sold Mr. Fawcett a different brand. You don't think they're getting sick, do you, Mitch?
Mitch knows lots of people in San Francisco. Of course, they're mostly hoods.
Cathy!
Cathy!
Well, Mom, he's the first to admit it. He spends half his day in the detention cells at the Hall of Justice.

In a democracy, Cathy, everyone is entitled to a fair trial. Your brother's practice...
In a democracy, Cathy, everyone is entitled to a fair trial. Your brother's practice...
Mom, please, I know all the democracy jazz. They're still hoods. He's got a client now who shot his wife in the head six times. Six times, can you imagine it? I mean, even twice would be overdoing it, don't you think?
Yes, I did.
Just listen to them!
Mother!
If your father were here...
Mitch, can I bring the lovebirds in here?
No!
No!
Mom, they're in a cage!
Mom, they're in a cage!
They're birds!
They haven't harmed anyone.
Take them.
Miss Daniels?
Yes?
They're beautiful! They're just what I wanted! Is there a man and a woman? I can't tell which is which.
Well, I suppose...
I still don't understand how you knew I wanted lovebirds.
Your brother told me.
Is smoking fun?
Oh, I suppose so.
Oh, I suppose so.
Could I have a puff?
Could I have a puff?
I don't think your mother would like that.
I don't think your mother would like that.
Just a little one.
Why, it's just like air, isn't it? When I grow up, I'm gonna smoke like a chimney! I'll be eleven tomorrow, you know.
I know.
I know.
Are you coming to my party?
Are you coming to my party?
I don't think so. I have to get back to San Francisco.

Don't you like us?

Darling, of course I do!

Don't you like Bodega Bay?

I don't know yet.

Mitch likes it very much. He comes up every weekend, you know, even though he has his own apartment in the city. He says San Francisco is just an ant hill at the foot of a bridge.

I guess it does get a little hectic at times.

If you do decide to come, don't say I told you about it. It's supposed to be a surprise party.
Why didn't Annie stay for dinner?
She said something about having to get home to take a call from her mother back East.

What's the matter with them?
We've got an extra room upstairs and everything.
That road can be a bad one at night, Melanie.
Yeah, but she'll be hitting all that traffic going back to San Francisco.
Did you put the cover on that cage, Mom?
Mitch? Why are they doing this? The birds.
I don't know, honey.
I don't know, honey.
Why are they trying to kill people?
Why are they trying to kill people?
I wish I could say. But if I could answer that, I could also tell you why people are trying to kill people.
Cathy! Get a blanket and some bandages!
Is she all right?
Mitch, let's turn back.
Shhh. Shhhhh.
Mitch? Do... do you think they'll be all right? In the trunk? Can they breath?
I think they'll be all right, honey.
What?

I see. How do I get down there?

Follow the road straight through town 'til it curves off on the left. That'll take you right around the bay to their front door.

I need her exact name, you see.
I need her exact name, you see.
That case, I tell you what you do. You go straight through town 'til you see a little hotel on your left there. Not the motel, that's the other end of town. This is the hotel. Now you take a right turn there, you got that?

Near the top of the hill, you'll see the school and right behind it, the church. You head for the school. Now just past the school, you'll see a little house with a red mail box. That's where Annie Hayworth lives, she's the school teacher. You ask her about the little Brenner girl.

Can I have the boat in about twenty minutes?
How much for the phone calls?
It's nothing.
I don't see what difference it makes, Mrs. Bundy, crows or blackbirds. If they attacked the school, that's pretty serious.
I hardly think either species would have the intelligence to launch a massed attack. Their brain pans aren't large enough for such...
Mrs. Bundy, you don't seem to understand. This young lady says there was an attack on the school.
Impossible.
I didn't even know there were many crows in Bodega Bay this time of year.
The crow is a permanent resident throughout its range. In fact, during our Christmas Count, we recorded...
Why not, Mrs. Bundy?
Because there are 8,650 species of birds in the world today, Mr. Carter. It's estimated that five billion, seven hundred and fifty million birds live in the United States alone. The five continents of the world...
What good'll that do? Smoke's as bad as birds.
Birds are not bad!
Deke, have you got a first aid kit back there?
What happened?
What happened?
Young woman cut herself.

Shall I call the doctor?
Shall I call the doctor?
I don't think it's that serious. You want to sit up here?
You cut yourself outside, Miss?
Stop worrying, Deke. She was in a boat.
I had a man trip and fall in the parking lot once, sued me before I could bat an eyelash.
I don't think Miss Daniels is going to sue anybody.
I don't think Miss Daniels is going to sue anybody.
Well, you're the lawyer.
We don't have any fog this time of year, Mitch.
We'll make our own fog.
Gulls!
They're back!
Are you finished here, Sebastian?
Let me have some apple pie, Helen. Who said anything about war? All I said was that some gulls...

One apple pie! You want more coffee?

No. ...came down on one of my boats. They could have been after the fish, just as you said.
Here's your pie, Sebastian. You want it at the table?
No. Here's fine.
No. Here's fine.
Where are the Bloody Marys, Deke?
I thought I saw your car. What are you doing in town?
I had to acknowledge a delivery. Mother, I'd like you to meet...
I had to acknowledge a delivery. Mother, I'd like you to meet...
A what?

Oh. I see.
For Cathy. For her birthday. By the way, where is she?

Across at Brinkmeyer's.

Miss Daniels is staying for the weekend. In fact, I've already invited her to dinner tonight.
You did say birds?
Yes, lovebirds. We couldn't let you...
Yes, lovebirds. We couldn't let you...
Lovebirds, I see.
Lovebirds, I see.
...get away without thanking you in some small way. After all, you haven't even met Cathy and you are staying for the weekend...
Seven o'clock, same as usual.
I'll pick you up, Miss Daniels. Where are you staying?
There's nothing wrong with those chickens, Mitch. I'm going to call Fred Brinkmeyer right now.
I don't know what good that'll do. Chickens won't eat.
He sold the feed to me, didn't he?
Caviat emptor, Mother. Let the buyer beware.

I suppose so. Her father owns a big newspaper in San Francisco.

I know exactly what I want, Mother.
Well... well, is everyone all right?
I think he got a little scratch, Mother.
Tell him about the party.
That's right. We had a party here this afternoon for Cathy. Her birthday.
Did you you get the windows in the attic, Mitch?
I got them all, Mother.
I got them all, Mother.
When do you think they'll come?

Mother! I'm trying my best! I'm... trying... my...
I'm sorry, Mitch.
Mitch...
Shhh. Shhh.
Mother, get a rope!
Oh, my God, look at her!
Oh, my God, look at her!
Get a rope!
I can handle it.
I know you can. But I'd like to.
I'm not very good at this, Mitch.
You're doing fine.

I started to say... inside...

You don't have to.
Then you knew Mitch in San Francisco, is that right?
No, not exactly.
If I go across to Santa Rosa I'll come onto the freeway much earlier.
Yeah, and the freeway's well-lighted, isn't it, Mitch?
No, it's me, Mrs. Brenner. I thought you might like some tea.
Oh, thank you.
Where's Mitch?
Al Malone wanted him out at the Fawcett farm.

What good will they do?
Do you think Cathy's all right?
What?

Cathy. At the school.
Yes, I'm sure she's fine.
Do I sound foolish to you?
Do I sound foolish to you?
No.
No.
I keep seeing Dan Fawcett's face. They have such big windows at the school. All the windows were broken. In Dan's bedroom. All the windows.

Try not to think of that, Mrs. Brenner.

I wish I were a stronger person. There is a long awkward silence. She sips at her tea reflectively.

I lost my husband four years ago, you know. It's odd how you depend on someone for strength, and then suddenly all the strength is gone, and you're alone. I'd love to relax some time. I'd love to be able to sleep. Do you think Cathy's all right?

Annie's there. She'll be all right.
Annie's there. She'll be all right.
I'm not this way, you know. Not usually. I don't fuss and fret over my children. When Frank died... You see, he knew the children, he really knew them. He had the knack of being able to enter into their world, of becoming a part of them. That's a rare talent.

I wish I could be that way.
I miss him. You know, sometimes I wake up in the morning, and I think 'I have to make Frank's breakfast,' and I... I get up and there's a... a very good reason for getting out of bed until... until, of course, I remember. I miss talking to him. Cathy's a child, you know, and Mitch... ...Mitch has his own life. I'm glad he
Would you like to rest now, Mrs. Brenner.
Would you like to rest now, Mrs. Brenner.
No. No... don't go yet. I feel as if I... I don't understand you. And I want so much to understand.
No. No... don't go yet. I feel as if I... I don't understand you. And I want so much to understand.
Why, Mrs. Brenner?
Why, Mrs. Brenner?
Because my son is... My son seems to be fond of you. And I... I'm not quite sure how I feel about it. I really don't know if I... like you or not.

Mitch has always done exactly what he wanted to do. I'm not complaining. That's the mark of a man. But... You see, I... I wouldn't want to be... be left alone. I don't think I could bear being left alone. I... forgive me. This business with the birds has me upset. I... I don't know what I'd do if Mitch weren't here.

I don't mind, really.
I don't mind, really.
Would you? I'd feel so much better.
Would you? I'd feel so much better.
I'll just clear up here, and then dress.
That's the last of it.
Did you close the door?
Did you close the door?
And locked it.
Please don't mess me up with bandages, Mrs. Brenner.
Shhhh. Shhhh.
Shhhh. Shhhh.
Please.
That's a chimney swift, all right.
We know what it is, Al.
Well, these birds live in chimneys, you know.
Not by the thousands.

No, I gotta admit this is peculiar. Did you have a light burning or something.
No, I gotta admit this is peculiar. Did you have a light burning or something.
Yes, but the curtains were drawn.

'Cause sometimes birds are attracted by light, you know. Sure is a peculiar thing.

What are we going to do about it, Al?
What are we going to do about it, Al?
I don't think I get you, Mitch. Do about what?
I don't think I get you, Mitch. Do about what?
Well... Well... these birds attacked us.
What's more likely, they got in the room and was just panicked, that's all.
All right, I'll grant you a bird'll panic in an enclosed room. But, they didn't just get in. They came in! Right down that chimney.

These birds were...
What I'm trying to say, Mitch, is these things happen sometimes, you know? Ain't much we can do about it.
Oh, yeah, yeah. How old is she now?
Eleven. In the middle of the party, some gulls came down at the children. And Miss Daniels was attacked by a gull just yesterday after...
Does this room look silly?
No, you got quite a mess here, I'll admit that. Maybe you oughta put some screening on top of your chimney Seems a little pointless, though. Freak accident like this wouldn't happen again in a million years. You want some help cleaning up?

Mitch, if they hear the car starting... if they see movement...
We'll take it slow until we get to the main road. Are you ready?
Can we turn back?
I... I don't think so. If we get through town, I think we'll be all right.

No, the birds didn't attack until the children were outside the school. Crows, I think. I don't know, Daddy. Is there a difference between crows and blackbirds?
There is very definitely a difference, Miss.
There is very definitely a difference, Miss.
They're different, Daddy. Thank you. I think these were crows. Yes, hundreds of them. Yes, they attacked the children, attacked them. Daddy, a little girl was sent to the hospital in Santa Rosa. Well, all right, but you act as if I'm... all right, all right. No, I can't come home now. I just can't, Daddy. How is it there? I mean... are there
They're both perching birds, of course, but of quite different species. The crow is brachyrhynchos. The blackbird is cyanocephalus.
Thank you. Do you know Dan Fawcett's number?
I just came from the school, madam. I don't know about their brain pans but...
Birds are not aggressive creatures, Miss. They bring beauty to the world. It is mankind, rather, who...
Hello, may I speak to Mitch Brenner, please? Yes, I'll wait.
...insist on making it difficult for life to survive on this planet. If it weren't for birds...
Yes, all right, I'll wait for you. Good-by.
I hardly think a few birds are going to bring about the end of the world.
I hardly think a few birds are going to bring about the end of the world.
These weren't a few birds.
The gulls were after your fish, Mr. Sholes. Really, let's be logical about this.
What were the crows after at the school?
What were the crows after at the school?
What do you think they were after, Miss...?
What do you think they were after, Miss...?
Daniels. I think they were after the children.
Daniels. I think they were after the children.
For what purpose?
For what purpose?
To... To kill them.
I don't know why.
I thought not. Birds have been on this planet since archaeopteryx, Miss Daniels; a hundred and twenty million years ago!
Doesn't it seem odd that they'd wait all that time to start a... a war against humanity?
No one called it a war!
Have you ever seen a jay protecting a nest?
I have seen jays doing everything it is conceivable for jays to do. Ornithology happens to be my avocation, Miss Daniels. You're talking about preservation of the species, a hen protecting her young. There's a vast difference between...

Maybe they're all protecting the species. Maybe they're tired of being shot at and roasted in ovens and...

Are you discussing gamebirds now? All birds are not gamebirds, you know.
Are you discussing gamebirds now? All birds are not gamebirds, you know.
I don't know anything about birds except that they're attacking this town.
And what? Vultures? Hawks? Eagles?
Maybe! Is it impossible?
Maybe! Is it impossible?
Yes. I have never known birds of different species to flock together. The very concept is unimaginable. Why if that happened, we wouldn't have a chance. How could we possible hope to fight them?
Sebastian, I'm not an alarmist.
No one ever said you were, Mitch.
No one ever said you were, Mitch.
I think we're in trouble. I don't know how or why this started, but I know it's here and I know we'd be crazy to ignore it.
Look, Mitch, even if this is true, even if all the birds...
Do you believe it's true, Sebastian?
Do you believe it's true, Sebastian?
No. I don't, Mitch. Because I can't see any reason for it.
No. I don't, Mitch. Because I can't see any reason for it.
It's happening. Isn't that a good enough reason?
It's happening. Isn't that a good enough reason?
I like Bodega Bay as well as any man. If I thought...

Then help me, Sebastian. You're an important man in this town. If you'll help, the rest will.
Then help me, Sebastian. You're an important man in this town. If you'll help, the rest will.
Help how? What do you want to do?
Help how? What do you want to do?
I'm not sure, but...
I'm not sure, but...
If you don't even know what you want to do...
I only know we've got to drive them away from town -- before they drive us away.
How?
How?
Mrs. Bundy, you said something about Santa Cruz. About seagulls getting lost in the fog, and heading in for the lights.
How do you plan to do that?
With smoke.
How can we go on living here if we blanket the town with smoke?
Can we go on living here otherwise?
Scotch, light on the water.
You and Mr. Sholes seem to be implying as much.
Birds?
Yeah, birds. All they do is make a mess of everything. Who needs them?
Yeah, birds. All they do is make a mess of everything. Who needs them?
We need them.
We need them.
Not if they're starting a war.
Not if they're starting a war.
They are incapable of organized warfare!
Then fight back. Get yourselves guns and wipe them off the face of the earth.
That would hardly be possible.
Kill them all. Get rid of them. Messy animals.
...probably contain more than a hundred billion birds!
That's right, sir, I recall it. A large flock of seagulls got lost in a fog and headed in for the town, where all the lights were.
They made some mess, too, smashing into houses and everything. They always make a mess. We're better off without them.
They made some mess, too, smashing into houses and everything. They always make a mess. We're better off without them.
The point is that no one seemed to get upset about it. They were gone the next morning, just as if nothing at all had happened. Poor things.
How many gulls did you count, Mrs. Bundy?
Which gulls, Mr. Sholes? There are several varieties.
Which gulls, Mr. Sholes? There are several varieties.
The ones that've been raising the devil with my fishing boats.
The ones that've been raising the devil with my fishing boats.
Probably herring gulls. They arrive in November, you know, and don't migrate North again until March or...
Actually, those gulls must have been after the fish.
Of course.
Of course.
Makes a lot more sense than... well, an attack.
Makes a lot more sense than... well, an attack.
Of course it does. If we believe that birds are attacking, why... why next we'll believe that grasshoppers and cockroaches are capable of...
I'm going out that way, lady. You can follow me.
Then let's go. Now!
Then let's go. Now!
I haven't finished my drink.
I haven't finished my drink.
Put on your coats! Do you want to get trapped here?
Were the Santa Rosa police at your school today? Are you coming?
Take it easy, lady. There isn't a bird anywhere in sight.
Something like this happened in Santa Cruz last year. The town was covered with seagulls.
Can't you please finish your drink?
I'm leaving! Are you coming?
All right, all right! Hope you figure this out, folks.
I'm Donald Fettes.
I'm very pleased to know you, Master Fettes.
I'm very pleased to know you, Master Fettes.
Mr. Gray?
Mr. Gray?
That's right. Gray, the cabman. I've had a bit of dealing with MacFarlane in the past, you know.
Dr. MacFarlane said I should pay you --
Of course -- it's the soul of the business -- the pay --
I fear he may have to.
But can't you give me any idea?
But can't you give me any idea?
How could I? I will do my best. After all, you see, I am financially interested.
There, Master Fettes. Sooner than we had expected. A stoke of luck one might say.
Good.
Oh, you'll have ample opportunity -- ample -- Good morning, Dr. Fettes.
Good morning.
You asked to see me, ma'am?
I want you to help my little girl.
I want you to help my little girl.
I'm only a student.
I'm only a student.
Georgina told me how kind you were to her. It gave me hope you might intercede for us with Dr. MacFarlane.
Georgina told me how kind you were to her. It gave me hope you might intercede for us with Dr. MacFarlane.
I don't know that I can do that, Mrs. Marsh.
I don't know that I can do that, Mrs. Marsh.
Did he tell you about Georgina?
I didn't mean it that way. I meant only that I am not in a position to ask favors.
Ask this one favor --
Ask this one favor --
Of course I will.
You have his promise, then?
Yes.
-- pain -- and shock. She's brave enough, but I don't know about myself. Now that it seems so close, I wonder if I dare trust my child into any but God's hands. Maybe He knows best.
Ma'am, is you'll allow me, I'd like to give you cause for courage -- Dr. MacFarlane is a great man -- I think he's the greatest man in medicine. God would not have given him such gifts if they were not meant for Georgina's cure.
Good morning, Mrs. Marsh.
Good morning, Mr. Fettes.
It's not because of Georgina -- because of Dr. MacFarlane's failure?
It's not the failure. I feel that MacFarlane has taught me nothing. He taught me the mathematics of anatomy but he couldn't teach me the poetry of medicine.
Even so, I could never think of going on -- I've got to find some other profession.
It is a pity.
You must leave this house.
I can't do that -- you heard MacFarlane.
I can't do that -- you heard MacFarlane.
Save yourself. Master Fettes look at MacFarlane and be warned.
Save yourself. Master Fettes look at MacFarlane and be warned.
He's a great doctor -- a great man --
He's a great doctor -- a great man --
Is it a great man whom Gray can order to his bidding? Is it a great man who for very shame dare not acknowledge his own wife so that I must play maidservant for the world's sake and his success?
He could have been a great man -- a good man and a fine doctor, but there was always the shame of the old life and the old ways to hold him back -- and always Gray -- Gray to hound him to his death.
You're over-excited, Mistress Cameron.
You're over-excited, Mistress Cameron.
I'm cold as ice.

But Gray's only a cab driver -- a Resurrection Man who robs graves to make a bit of money now and again.

If he were only that. The man's evil himself. Some day you'll know him as MacFarlane knows him -- for MacFarlane he was to Knox as you are to him. That brought him close to Gray, he roistered with him and drank with him. Aye, and Gray even brought him to my door and my love. There is all that between them and more

But that's long since. Gray can't threaten him with that.

Aye.

They did not tell you how that porter cried out in the witness box when the Kings Counselor pressed him hard -- how he cried out that he was shielding a gentleman of consequence.
That porter was Gray and the gentleman of consequence who couldn't swallow the shame of it -- who took my last paltry savings to hire Gray --
MacFarlane
Listen to me, Fettes, I'm one part befuddled with drink, one part over-heels in love with MacFarlane, and one part fey. You're a lowlander, Fettes, and you have no way of knowing what we Highlanders call the second sight.
I've heard of it.
I've heard of it.
It's a gift to my people -- and I see MacFarlane and Gray-- the pit yawns for them and the flames -- and I would have you away from them and safe out of the torment.--
He's not home.
Where can I find him?
Where can I find him?
You don't went to find him. Your news will keep until I tell him.
You don't went to find him. Your news will keep until I tell him.
But I must tell him -- he must know of it. Please -- tell me where he is.
But I must tell him -- he must know of it. Please -- tell me where he is.
There's no standing between a fool and his folly. If you must babble your news to him he's at the Fisherman's Tryst. It's the inn at Pennycuik. You can use MacFarlane's horse and gig to get there. He'll welcome the ride back.

At Pennycuik. I know the inn. I can be there in an hour.
At Pennycuik. I know the inn. I can be there in an hour.
And back with MacFarlane and all that he stands for the next day.
Excuse me, Dr. MacFarlane --
Come in, boy -- come in.
But, Doctor, I only wanted to speak to you --
Come -- it's a chance to try out your bedside manner, Fettes. Take a look at the child.
Dr. MacFarlane --
Excuse me.
I'm afraid I'll have to give up medicine, Dr. MacFarlane.
You're made for a doctor, young man!
You're made for a doctor, young man!
I'm afraid I have to, sir. You see, my father is vicar at Thrums -- it's a small parish -- not much of a living --
I'm afraid I have to, sir. You see, my father is vicar at Thrums -- it's a small parish -- not much of a living --

Well? And are you not a good student?

But Richardson?
But Richardson?
Richardson is a fine student. He's got a glib tongue, but you'll be a better doctor, Fettes. Come along now --
You know how we get the specimens we use for dissection?
From the Municipal Council -- they're the bodies of paupers --
I don't think I can go on, sir.
What the devil do you mean? You have your lodgings, a certain stipend -- I thought I had arranged everything for you --
What the devil do you mean? You have your lodgings, a certain stipend -- I thought I had arranged everything for you --
I saw the woman whose son's body was delivered last night.
And that's why you don't want to be a doctor, Fettes?
Not if I have to be party to things like that, Dr. MacFarlane.
But this woman -- and her son --
I'm sorry for the woman, Fettes. But her son might be alive today had more doctors been given the opportunity to work on more human specimens. As for me, Fettes, I let no man stop me when I know I'm right -- when I know that I need those lifeless subjects for my student's enlightenment and for my own knowledge. And if you're a
Dr. MacFarlane -- you remember the lady who came to see you yesterday -- the lady with the little girl?
I remember her.
I remember her.
She came again today. She wanted me to ask you if you would not break your rule and operate. She feels you are her only hope.
She came again today. She wanted me to ask you if you would not break your rule and operate. She feels you are her only hope.
So she told me. I'm a teacher -- not a practitioner.
It was about last night I wanted to talk to you -- about the operation on the little Marsh girl.
You're a man of the world, Fettes, you wouldn't hold me to promise given in drink.
You're a man of the world, Fettes, you wouldn't hold me to promise given in drink.
But I -- well, you see, sir, I met Mrs. Marsh and told her.

Really, Fettes, you irk me with your lack of understanding.
Really, Fettes, you irk me with your lack of understanding.
But you did promise.
But you did promise.
Look here, Fettes. Not I nor anyone else knows enough about the spinal column and its intricacies to insure success in such an operation. I would have to study the matter. Have we any "subjects"?

Wilmont used up the last spinal section.

You see, it is completely out of the question.
You see, it is completely out of the question.
Yes, I suppose so.
Yes, I suppose so.
Now you run off and see that pretty Mrs. Marsh and explain to her.
Every street singer with a cracked voice gives tongue to that one.
This girl was beautiful -- a wild lassie from the Highlands.
Well --
Gray killed her.
Gray killed her.
We can't be sure of that.
We can't be sure of that.
I am sure. I mean to report it. It's like Burke and Hare all over again.
I wouldn't do that, Fettes. I wouldn't report it.
Grave robbing is one thing -- this is murder.
I don't know that -- neither do you. This subject may have been an epileptic -- thrown a fit -- fallen out of bed -- cracked her skull and killed herself -- there is everything explained -- the bruise on her head --
I can't believe that.
I can't believe that.
Believe it or not. It's best for you to pretend that you do. After all, it was you who ordered this specimen, received it here, and paid for it. That makes you a party to murder.
But, I didn't ask him to kill.
Who would believe that? And you know, someone else might recognize her. She was as well known as the Castle Rock.
Here is where you must watch closely, gentleman -- closely -- it is the very heart of the matter --
Wait, Doctor -- wait! The child's fainting.
She's unconscious.
Pulse?
I just saw Gray. What was he laughing at?
He has his own idea of a joke. Perhaps his horse tickled him in the ribs.

I've just been to see Mrs. Marsh. Georgina is doing splendidly. The incision has healed -- clean and fine -- but she doesn't seem to have any desire to walk.

When she's ready you bring her to me -- I'll show her how.

Dr. MacFarlane, I wonder if you know what happiness you've brought those people.
Dr. MacFarlane, I wonder if you know what happiness you've brought those people.
That's only our duty, Fettes -- that's the end at which we aim with all this nasty business.
I suppose one must pass through this purgatory to the heaven of being a good doctor.
That's the way of it, Fettes. You bring the lassie to me.
You can't -- can't! Stop trying to bribe her with childishness about white horses. Let the child stand and walk -- her spine's all right. I know it's all right.
But she must want to stand. She must want to walk.
But she must want to stand. She must want to walk.
Confound me, the child's a cripple, of course she wants to walk. Child, I say to you get up out of that chair and walk.
Fettes, the more things are wrong, the more we must act as if everything were right. You must do with Joseph as you did with, the street singer -- complete dissection -- a proper entry in the book --
No.
No.
What do you mean, Fettes?
What do you mean, Fettes?
I'll have no more to do with it. I'll not put my neck into the noose, not even for your sake, Dr. MacFarlane.
I'll have no more to do with it. I'll not put my neck into the noose, not even for your sake, Dr. MacFarlane.
Don't be a fool. One can't begin and then stop -- and because that entry of the girl's body is in your hand, you'll do as I say. As for me, I'll tend to Gray.
What's that you say?
The little girl -- she couldn't walk far -- the muscles are too weak -- but she did stand and she took a step or two.
The little girl -- she couldn't walk far -- the muscles are too weak -- but she did stand and she took a step or two.
I know it -- I know it -- The moment I was rid of him --
I know it -- I know it -- The moment I was rid of him --
What?
What?
Gray -- I'm rid of him --
See that, Fettes?
A burial party -- poor people -- it's hard to bury a loved one on a rainy day when the churchyard is so cold and lonely.

Did you think Gray was the only one who could handle a mattock and shovel? I've had some practice in the art.
You couldn't do that, Doctor.
You couldn't do that, Doctor.
I pass up no opportunities, I've a whole course of lectures in mind for you fellows. We'll need subjects to demonstrate. Come along.
I pass up no opportunities, I've a whole course of lectures in mind for you fellows. We'll need subjects to demonstrate. Come along.
No.
No.
Why not? I must have subjects. It's the only way I can teach. It's the only way you can learn. The stupidity of the people the idiocy of their laws will not stop no -- nor will they force me to deal with such reptilian creatures as Gray. We can do our own dirty work -- and we must.
Where shall we put it? In the back?
No room there. We'll have to set it between us.
This is not a woman!
It was a woman when we put her in.
It was a woman when we put her in.
Hold that lamp up -- I must see her face.
Are you a doctor, too?
Not yet.
Not yet.
You'll be a good doctor. I know all about doctors.
What you really want to ask me is about my back, isn't it -- about where it hurts?
Why, yes.
Why, yes.
Well --
Hear him?
The white horse. The horse that is going to greet me when he sees me.
The white horse. The horse that is going to greet me when he sees me.
An old acquaintance, eh?
Why do you want the white horse to bid you "good-day"?
He was a nice horse.
He was a nice horse.
Maybe there's another reason. Maybe you haven't friends enough. Could that be it, Georgina?
Of course -- I don't have friends. That's because I can't walk. I try to make myself used to it.
One shouldn't get used to the wrong things, Georgina. You want to walk and run and play.
Aye, but I still wonder how much.
I want it --
I want it --
But you'll have to stand great pain, Georgina. Greater pain than you ever dreamed of in the worst time of your sickness. Do you want it that much?
Don't you want to find the white horse, Georgina? You can't find him from a wheelchair. You have to walk and run to find him.
I can't.
I thought this was a school day.
I am not at the school anymore. I left last night.
You'll not need that again, Georgina.
I wanted to see the white horse --
He'll not leave the grave -- not since Wednesday last when we buried the lad.
Your son, ma'am? He must have been a fine boy for the wee dog to love him so.
Not much danger here, ma'am, I wouldn't think -- right here in the heart of Edinburgh.
They're uncommon bold, the grave robbers -- and the daft doctors who drive them on.

I'm by way of being a medical myself.
I'm by way of being a medical myself.
A doctor?
A doctor?
A student. I'm studying under Dr. MacFarlane -- that is, I've been studying until today --
Come, Toddy -- come. Sit down here with me.
Don't call me that confounded name.
Don't call me that confounded name.
Well, then, Doctor MacFarlane -- although I've known a time, Toddy, when you liked the name. Aye, and many are dead now who called you by it; rough and wild ones they were, too. But come Toddy, sit down here with your young friend.
Mr. Fettes and I have professional matters to discuss.
Medicine? That'll keep. Sit down.
I will not have you use that name to me.
You will not have it?
You're a teacher, eh? Maybe you're afraid to be a doctor, Toddy.
Afraid of what?
Afraid of what?
Afraid you are not as good a doctor perhaps as you make out to be.
Afraid you are not as good a doctor perhaps as you make out to be.
I am the best man for the job.

Why don't you do it then?
You? Why? Since when have you become the protector of little children?
I'm not concerned about the child, Toddy. It's you I'm thinking of, I'd like to see you prove that a lot of things I know haven't hurt Toddy MacFarlane any.
I'm not concerned about the child, Toddy. It's you I'm thinking of, I'd like to see you prove that a lot of things I know haven't hurt Toddy MacFarlane any.
I'll not do it, Gray.
I'll not do it, Gray.
Oh, yes, you will. You'll do it to oblige Fettes and myself.
Oh, yes, you will. You'll do it to oblige Fettes and myself.
No.
No.
Maybe there's some private reason between you and me which will make you -- some long lost friend of ours. Say that you'll do it for me and my friend, Mr. Fettes, here.
It might be an interesting case.
That's a good boy, Toddy.
Toddy hates me.
Don't call me that confounded name, I tell you.
Don't call me that confounded name, I tell you.
Hear him? Did you ever see the lads play knife?
Now that wasn't a friendly thing I heard, Toddy. Not at all friendly.
That has nothing to do with it. We've decided to do more lecturing and less dissection -- it's better for the students -- that's all there is to it.
That has nothing to do with it. We've decided to do more lecturing and less dissection -- it's better for the students -- that's all there is to it.
You know what you want and don't want -- so that's an end of business between us -- but we'll still be friends, Toddy. I'll be dropping by to see you and Meg once in a while -- for auld lang syne, you know.
You know what you want and don't want -- so that's an end of business between us -- but we'll still be friends, Toddy. I'll be dropping by to see you and Meg once in a while -- for auld lang syne, you know.
I suppose we can't prevent that, Gray -- -- for auld lang syne.
Oh, it's you, Gray. Well, come in. Sit down. Have a glass with me.
You're uncommon friendly tonight, Toddy. More like the old days.
You know something about the human body, Gray.
I've had some experience.
I've had some experience.
Then you can understand that the backbone is a lot of little blocks and those little blocks are all held together, so that it works like that whip of yours. You know that, don't you?

Oh, it's the bit of a girl Fettes was talking about.
Oh, it's the bit of a girl Fettes was talking about.
The same. Look here, Gray --
You can't build life like you put together blocks, Toddy.
What are you talking about? I am an anatomist. I know the body. I know how it works.
What are you talking about? I am an anatomist. I know the body. I know how it works.
And you're a fool, Toddy -- and no doctor. It's only the dead ones that you know.

Like Knox taught you? Like I taught you? In cellars and graveyards? Did Knox teach you what makes the blood flow?

But what makes a thought start?
But what makes a thought start?
In the brain, I tell you. I know.
In the brain, I tell you. I know.
You don't know and you'll never know or understand, Toddy. Not from me or from Knox would you learn those things. Look --
I am a doctor - a good doctor. I could make her walk, but she won't - she won't --
Here, have another glass, MacFarlane. I'll take you home and we'll be friends again -- now that you know that you're Knox's man and my friend -- aye, forever.
Why should I be afraid of you? What are you holding over me?
I'll tell you what, Toddy. It's because I ran down the streets with the mud and the stones around my ears and the mob yelling for my blood. It's because you were afraid to face it -- and you're still afraid.
I'll tell you what, Toddy. It's because I ran down the streets with the mud and the stones around my ears and the mob yelling for my blood. It's because you were afraid to face it -- and you're still afraid.
No, I'm not afraid. Tell! Shout it from the housetops! And remember this -- they hanged Burke -- they mobbed Hare -- but Dr. Knox is living like a gentleman in London.
Aye, Toddy, there is something in what you say.
There is much in what I say, Gray, and if you have any regard for your neck you'll leave now and stay away from my house, my school, and from me.
There is much in what I say, Gray, and if you have any regard for your neck you'll leave now and stay away from my house, my school, and from me.
I have no wish for a rope cravat. I've never liked the smell of hemp, so I'll bid you good night, Doctor MacFarlane.
What are you going here? Have I not told you --
Would you grudge me a glass with my old crony, Meg?
I brought you something tonight, MacFarlane -- an interesting specimen -- in very good condition.
I've ordered nothing from you.
I've ordered nothing from you.
This is a gift.
This is a gift.
I take no gifts from you.

This is a gift you'll not return.

Get out of here!
Get out of here!
Wait, Toddy. That's not hospitable. I want to discuss business.
Wait, Toddy. That's not hospitable. I want to discuss business.
You are not to set foot in here again, Gray, for business or any other reason. And you're going out now!
Gray, I must rid myself of you -- you've become a cancer -- a malignant, evil cancer -- rotting my mind.
So, Toddy, you've made me a disease, eh?
So, Toddy, you've made me a disease, eh?
I can't understand your hurt to me -- but I must cut you out.
Surely you are not threatening an old friend, Toddy.
We have never been friends.
Have another glass of something good, Toddy.
I've drunk enough tonight.
I've drunk enough tonight.
Another little drop'll never do you any harm.
You're getting old, Gray, and it's a hard life driving a cab through these wet and windy streets of Edinburgh --
I have other means of sustenance.
I have other means of sustenance.
The Resurrection business? That may end sooner than you think. New laws may come.
What I was going to say is this -- wouldn't you be more comfortable at Leith in a neat little house?
Would you bribe me to leave you be?
Would you bribe me to leave you be?
I would make you rich.
I would make you rich.
It wouldn't be half so much fun for me. Toddy, as to have you come here and beg --
It wouldn't be half so much fun for me. Toddy, as to have you come here and beg --
Beg -- beg of you! You crawling graveyard rat!
Well then -- I beg you -- I beseech you --
But then I wouldn't have the fun of having you come here and beg again, Toddy.
But why, Gray? Why?
Because it would be a hurt to me to see you no more, Toddy. You're a pleasure to me.
Because it would be a hurt to me to see you no more, Toddy. You're a pleasure to me.
A pleasure to torment me?
A pleasure to torment me?
No -- a pride to know that I can force you to my will. I'm a small man -- a humble man -- and being poor, I've had to do much that I did not want to do. But so long as the great Dr. MacFarlane jumps at my whistle, that long am I a man -- and if I have not that, I
I presume you shall. This won't be my last visit here.
I want to speak to you alone. I saw something. I heard.
I want to speak to you alone. I saw something. I heard.
What did you hear?
What did you hear?
I know --
You're welcome to my little nest, Joseph -- is it not? That's right -- you have something to say to me -- something very private.
Yes.
Yes.
Now that is very interesting -- Take a chair, Joseph,
Can anyone hear what we say?
Only Brother.
Only Brother.
I know that you kill people to sell bodies.
You say you've come here on your own account? No one knows you are here?
Give me money or I'll tell the police you murder the "subjects."
I have made you give me money, but you smile. Aren't you angry?
No, Joseph. I'm not angry -- here -- another glass of brandy --I'll wager it's better than the doctor's.
You and I should work together.
You mean we would sell the bodies to the doctors together? Dig them up?
You mean we would sell the bodies to the doctors together? Dig them up?
No digging Joseph. The churchyards are too well guarded. We will "Burke" them,

Burke them?
You are lately come to Scotland, Joseph?
You are lately come to Scotland, Joseph?
I come from Lisbon.
I come from Lisbon.
But still you may have heard the peddlers of verse cry out their names on the streets.
"The ruffian dogs, the Hellish pair. The villain Burke, the meager Hare --"
I never heard that song. But what did they do?
I never heard that song. But what did they do?
Eighteen persons they killed and sold the bodies to Dr. Knox at ten pounds for a large and eight pounds for a small. That's good business, Joseph.
But where did they get those people?
That was Hare's end. Ah, you should have seen him on the streets, when he saw some old beldam deep in drink how he cozened her!
"A good-day to you Madame Tosspot, and would you like a little glass of something before you take your rest? Come with me to my house and I'll make you my guest. You shall have quarts to drink if you like." Ah, how he cozened them.
We could do that. But when he had them there, then what?
We could do that. But when he had them there, then what?
"Nor did they handle axe or knife To take away their victim's life -- No sooner done than in a chest They crammed their lately welcome guest."
I don't understand the song. Tell me plain how they did it.
I'll show you how it was done, Joseph. -- I'll show you how they "Burked" them.
Was the paralysis immediate?
No, Doctor. She seemed to get better, then about six months later she began to complain of pain in her back --
No, Doctor. She seemed to get better, then about six months later she began to complain of pain in her back --
How long after that was the paralysis complete?

Nearly a year.
Nearly a year.
Any attacks of pain since?

Yes, Doctor.
Yes, Doctor.
Is her pain sporadic or constant?

It comes at intervals. They used to be months apart -- but they've been growing more frequent -- much more frequent.

See here, child, when you have this pain in your back, where is it?
Child seems to take to the lad. What sort of an accident was it, Ma'am?
A carriage overturned. My husband was killed and Georgina was hurt.
A carriage overturned. My husband was killed and Georgina was hurt.
How long ago?
How long ago?
Three years.
But can anything be done for her?
Perhaps -- a delicate operation -- an operation which has never been performed -- but it could be performed. I'm sure it could be -- I could incise the columna dorsi --
Believe me, Madame, if I were only a doctor, I would undertake this operation at once. But I'm more dominie than doctor -- I've a school to run.
But, Doctor, surely in a case like this -- a child -- a little child who can never walk or run --
But, Doctor, surely in a case like this -- a child -- a little child who can never walk or run --
I regret it, Ma'am, but I have the responsibility of training thirty other doctors to attend a thousand children like your own.
I regret it, Ma'am, but I have the responsibility of training thirty other doctors to attend a thousand children like your own.
There's nothing I can say for one small child?
There's nothing I can say for one small child?
I'm not heartless, Ma'am. I have every sympathy for you and for the little girl, but if I were to consent to every operation brought to me, I'd have no time for teaching -- and that's a great responsibility upon me, Ma'am -- a great responsibility.
I'm sorry, Doctor. Georgina's a good child -- a brave child -- you saw how she was during the operation -- but if she can't move, she can't move.
But she must be able to move. Everything is in place.
But she must be able to move. Everything is in place.
She would if she could.
She would if she could.
Then all my surgery is no good. There's something wrong with the child -- something I don't know -- something I can't define -- can't diagnose. I can do nothing for her.
And why not? He's a good lad -- bright and able.
Aye. He's a good lad. That's why I ask you, MacFarlane.
Aye. He's a good lad. That's why I ask you, MacFarlane.
You think it'll spoil the boy, eh? Was I not assistant to Knox?
You think it'll spoil the boy, eh? Was I not assistant to Knox?
Aye --
Aye --
Did it spoil me, Meg, my lass?
You're daft. What's Gray to me. He's only a man from whom I buy what I need when I need it -- the rest is forgotten.
You may deny the devil, Toddy, but you'll not rid yourself of him by saying the devil is dead.

Nonsense. You're a fey creature with mad ideas. But you have a wildness that holds me to you, lass.
Nonsense. You're a fey creature with mad ideas. But you have a wildness that holds me to you, lass.
No great lady will ever take my place?
Crony indeed!
You can get out.
Fettes -- where is Fettes?
I'll get him.
You're not going to Gray.
He must leave me alone.
You've been with Gray again.
Aye.
I hate that picture.
Where are they?
Where are they?
Can I get you something? A glass of water? A transfusion?
Can I get you something? A glass of water? A transfusion?
Where are they? Last chance.
Where are they? Last chance.
Or what? You'll bleed all over my carpet?
around, or whatever the hell you're doing here. What are you doing here?
I'm looking for my friends.
I'm looking for my friends.
See, I heard you were looking for some guy with a scar. How's that going? You find him? Yes? No?
How many innocent people did you leave dead back there?
You sent them. I had no choice.
You sent them. I had no choice.
Bullshit. You're a killer, that's all you are. A clown with a bird and a rising death toll. You think the world did you wrong?! You did the world wrong.
It was one thing her dad rejected you. But when she did you lost it.
You're wrong.
You're wrong.
Yeah? I see doubt oozing out your arm. Where do people go when they kill their girlfriends?
Was that it? Well, ok.
I'm not dying for your goddamn illusions. You got that? You think you and your girlfriend had some rosy future ahead of you? Bullshit. She was already bored, why do you think she was looking around? You're nothing, Corvis! Less than nothing.
What's been holding me together is the hope that maybe you do go someplace. And I'll be seeing her again soon. Only what will I say? That I was too stupid to find the guy who killed her? That he's down here laughing?
Tell her... we'll get him.
Tell her... we'll get him.
We won't.
We won't.
Someday he'll surface and I'll get him for both of you. I promise. I'll find the guy with the scar.
Check and mate.
Dream on.
Two down. Two to go.
"Down?" Wait, don't tell me.
"Down?" Wait, don't tell me.
The cops from my trial. They killed Lauren. The whole thing was fixed.
You think I'm crazy.
I'm thinking... that explains a lot.
Lauren's father's involved. He bought the cops fancy cars, I don't know what else. It's a company called D-E-L-T. I think Lauren found out.
What do they do that they had to kill her?
What do they do that they had to kill her?
I was hoping you'd find out.
I was hoping you'd find out.
Yeah. I sure will.
Leonard, Dutton, Erlich. They don't matter. I want the King.
We're getting there. Because in his so-called construction job, Tommy makes a daily delivery to a place called "The Hole."

I believe they call it a connoisseur's club. Owned by DELT.
Where is it? This place?
I think we should get some support?
I think we should get some support?
What? Call the police?
That was a fucking hollow point!
I guess it's true. Guns don't kill people...
Think maybe knives do?
Keep that thing away from me.
Keep that thing away from me.
This is not just some "thing." It's A C zero zero five.
Fuck! What do you want?
A scar. On the arm. Of the man who planted this in Alex Corvis's car.
A scar. On the arm. Of the man who planted this in Alex Corvis's car.
There's no scar, you freak. The Corvis kid made it up.
You killed her. I saw it.
Bitch killed herself when she shot a cop in the leg. If she' just acted like a girl nothing would have happened. So you're right, spooky. Happy?
Sssshhh. She's resting.
Where the fuck did you come from?
Where the fuck did you come from?
Big bang, primordial ooze, divine hand of a benevolent creator? All possibilities. Although recent events have given me doubts about the benevolent creator.
You lied at my trial.
I don't know you, man.
I don't know you, man.
Capital case nine nine dash C one one five. Alex Corvis. Exhibit A.
Hey. I said what I saw. Two kids arguing. A guy and a girl.
You said you saw me with this. I never held it until today.
You said you saw me with this. I never held it until today.
What's your damage, man? Corvis hacked up that girl like a motherfucker.
One chance to tell the truth, Tommy. Who is the man with the scar? He planted this in my car.
There's no scar. Corvis made it up.
Wrong. Answer.
Who are you?
What did they give you?
They showed me pictures, what he did to her. Evidence. Said all I had to do was stand up there and not my head "yes."

We're going to play a little game called "Who's got the Scar."
What Scar? What fucking scar?
What Scar? What fucking scar?
AAAANK. That's not how we play the game.
You're him! You're Corvis! We fried your ass. You're dead, man!
Good thing in a situation like this.
Fucking Zombie.
The scar.

There is no scar. I'm telling you.
I heard you were looking for this.
You're the guy killed Dutton.
You're the guy killed Dutton.
I want you to think of me as the guy who killed you.
Fuck. Me.
What happened to your leg there Officer? Hunting accident?
Not my arm! What you fucking want?
I want Lauren. I want my life back. I want... to know why.
I want Lauren. I want my life back. I want... to know why.
Why? Why's anything happen? It's all money, man. Money. The girl just got in the way.
The scar. Which of you has it?
Nobody.
Are you out of your fucking mind? We're going to die.
How can you die if you're already dead?
How can you die if you're already dead?
You're him. Corvis.
You're him. Corvis.
I was talking about you.
I was a friend of your sister's.
I know her friends.
I know her friends.
That locket you're holding. You have one just like it.
Yeah, no kidding.
Your father gave them to both of you.

And he's right over there by the way. What did you do to your face?

I told you, I knew your sister.
I told you, I knew your sister.
You killed that cop Dutton.
You killed that cop Dutton.
And another one. There. Erlich. Took a wrong turn.
I know who you are. That's why you paint your face. To hide.
I'm not hiding. I'm right here.
I'm not hiding. I'm right here.
You killed Lauren! You killed her!
I've been shot, and stabbed and thrown from a car and none of it hurt. But what you're doing now, does. I don't know why.
My dad was right! He said you'd ruin her life.
My dad was right! He said you'd ruin her life.
No. Listen to me. Lauren found out something they didn't want her to know. This.
From the bonfire over there. Look at it.
No! Why are you haunting me?
No! Why are you haunting me?
Because you need to understand. And you need... to be careful.
This is where it happened. Right over here.
Yeah, I know.
Are you ok?
When Lauren was missing the police came to our house. They said they were looking for her, right? But I know now they had her, and the reason they brought her here and knew the could blame it on you...
When Lauren was missing the police came to our house. They said they were looking for her, right? But I know now they had her, and the reason they brought her here and knew the could blame it on you...
No...
No...
... is that I sent them here. I told them she came here sometimes. With her dirtball boyfriend. That's exactly what I said.
Erin. It's not your fault.
It's all my fault. Oh God. I wish I were dead.
It's all my fault. Oh God. I wish I were dead.
No. You don't.
No. You don't.
Yes I do, I really do.
This tree. Here's where it happened.
I don't want to see!
... took everything I ever cared about. Left me with nothing.
So you're going to kill him?
So you're going to kill him?
Have to find him first.
You know what Lauren and I were fighting about that night? She had a secret, wouldn't tell me...
My father.
My father.
All I knew, she was pulling away. It made me crazy.
All I knew, she was pulling away. It made me crazy.
I used to be so proud of him. My big deal daddy. And now, he's just a crook. Worse even. And the weird thing is...
I wish I could hate him but I can't. He said he'd never hurt either of us, and I know it's true and... I'm going back.
It's what Lauren would do.
It's ok, it's ok...
It's not. I can't take it.
It's not. I can't take it.
Erin. Who?
Erin. Who?
I don't know. I found him lying there.
... it connects you to me...
No matter what happens... you're innocent... I promise...
In the woods you said you had nothing. But you wouldn't, and I wouldn't if there's some way you don't have to go. Please. At least not right away.
Erin. I'll always be with you.
I thought we had an understanding. I thought we understood that discretion is paramount.
Yeah, we do.
Yeah, we do.
Shut up.
Erlich gimping around in his goddamn hot rod is not discreet. I've got reporters asking me how much he made. I've got the entire force looking at this case now.
I know.
I know.
You know.
You know.
I know the guy leaves a sign.
Tommy Leonard. The eyewitness in the Corvis case.
Some hooker phoned it in. There was a riot at his apartment yesterday.

Guy dressed for Halloween?
Guy dressed for Halloween?
Good for you. You do know something.
They botched the execution.
Could say that.
Could say that.
Christ. It was Corvis. Tommy Leonard was right.
Fucking crow.
Sign of the dead come back to life.
How about sign of a big black bird?
The dead can return, given sufficient motivation. And Corvis has that.
Cause if you're losing your mind, I got a right to know.
He's looking for something. Won't stop until he finds it. Sometimes the best way to get rid of someone is to let them have what they want.
Just don't believe everything you see.
Doubt is a motherfucker.
Doubt is a motherfucker.
Give me a hand with this sack of shit.
Maybe we had a case of that here. Get me my kit.
You two are majorly demented. Anyone ever tell you that?
Do you believe in ghosts, Nathan? Because there's a ghost threatening us.
You mean Alex.
You mean Alex.
I mean Lauren.
Because you never accepted that what happened to her was an accident.
You killed my daughter.
An accident, Nathan.
She was eighteen years old! There were four of them. They stabbed her fifty three times! Where's the fucking accident?! Huh?! Where is it?!
I watched her grow up. Just like you. I know how her mind worked. She kept snooping around because she was worried about you. What you'd gotten yourself into. So stop blaming me. And blame yourself.
I do. Every day.
I do. Every day.
Erin knows, doesn't she?
Anything wrong?
Let's hope not. License and registration please.
What's with your friend there?
She's... sick. Actually she never had Mai Tais before.
She's... sick. Actually she never had Mai Tais before.
But you, you've had them.

Not tonight. Honest.
If you had a license, I bet I'd have seen it by now. How old are you? Fifteen?
Look, I'll tell you the truth. Jannie drove us and was supposed to drive us back, she has a license, but I mean... look at her.
You want me to walk a straight line?
I want you... to bend over.
I want you... to bend over.
Look, can I just call a cab?

Why are there so many?
Just hold on to me.
I want to take this to Lauren. She'd want it.

Stay in the car. I'll only take a second.

Erin. I know you think she's been talking to you.
Erin. I know you think she's been talking to you.
It's not that. Really. It's just... now that he's gone, I think it's time.
Erin!
Watch out!
What were you yelling about?
This guy said he was a friend of Lauren's. He had like paint all over his face.
This guy said he was a friend of Lauren's. He had like paint all over his face.
Are you ok?
Are you ok?
What's that supposed to mean? He was right here. He was!
What is it?

What? What is it?
Lauren called me that when we were little. Daisy. No one knew but us.
Lauren called me that when we were little. Daisy. No one knew but us.

It still doesn't mean...

I think I dropped an earring.
Looks like you have them both on.
You're in with them.
It's not what you think.
It's not what you think.
You killed her!
You killed her!
No.
No.
Stay away from me! Stay away!
Stay away from me! Stay away!
Erin. It wasn't supposed to happen.
They killed her because she found out.
About you.
About you.
About them. You've got to leave it alone.
Sweetheart...
Don't call me that! Don't call me anything!
I would never hurt you or Lauren. Never. Believe me.
I don't believe you.
I don't believe you.
Please. Come inside.
Please. Come inside.
I'm never going back in that house again. Get away.

My name is Klaatu. I spent two days at your Walter Reed Hospital. Room 309. My doctor's name was Major White -- and I had a very attractive nurse called Ruth, who's getting married next Wednesday. If you are not interested -- or if you intend to turn me over to your Army -- we needn't waste any more time.
You have faith, Professor Barnhardt
It isn't faith that makes good science, Mr. Klaatu. Its curiosity. Sit down, please. I have several thousand questions to ask you.

We know from scientific observation that you have discovered a rudimentary kind of atomic energy. We also know that
Yes -- that is true.
Yes -- that is true.
In the hands of a mature civilization, these would not be considered weapons of aggression. But in the hands of your people-- We've observed your aggressive tendencies, and we don't trust you with such power.

If you mean that you are afraid of us--
If you mean that you are afraid of us--
We want to be sure you don't make -- let us say -- an unfortunate mistake. We know the potentiality of these developments and we are disturbed to find them in the hands of children... You see, we've had atomic energy for five thousand of your years. We discarded instruments like this many centuries ago. So long as you were limited to fighting among

These other planets -- do they have peace and security?

We had our atomic wars -- thousands of years ago. After that we fought with bows and arrows. Then, slowly, we learned that fighting is no solution -- that aggression leads to chaos.

We scientists understand this. Even we primitive scientists. What exactly is the nature of your mission, Mr. Klaatu?
We scientists understand this. Even we primitive scientists. What exactly is the nature of your mission, Mr. Klaatu?
I came here to warn you that, by threatening danger, your planet faces danger -- very grave danger. I am prepared, however, to offer a solution.

Would you care to be more specific?
Would you care to be more specific?
What I have to say must be said to all concerned. It is too important to be entrusted to any individual.
I gather that your efforts on the official level were not entirely successful.
I come to you as a last resort -- and I confess that my patience is wearing thin. Must I take drastic action in order to get a hearing?
I come to you as a last resort -- and I confess that my patience is wearing thin. Must I take drastic action in order to get a hearing?
What -- what sort of action do you mean?
What -- what sort of action do you mean?
Violent action -- since that seems to be the only thing you people understand. Leveling the island of Manhattan, perhaps -- or dropping the Rock of Gibraltar into the sea.
Would you be willing to meet with the group of scientists I am calling together?. Perhaps you could explain your mission to them, and they in turn could present it to their various peoples.
That's what I came to see you about.
It is not enough to have men of science. We scientists are too easily ignored -- or misunderstood. We must get important men from every field. Educators -- philosophers -- church leaders -- men of vision and imagination -- the finest minds in the world.
I leave that in your hands.
I leave that in your hands.
You'd have no objection to revealing yourself at this meeting?

One thing, Mr. Klaatu. Suppose this group should reject your proposals. What is the alternative?
One thing, Mr. Klaatu. Suppose this group should reject your proposals. What is the alternative?
I'm afraid you have no alternative. In such, a case the planet Earth would have to be-- --eliminated.
Such power exists?
I assure you such power exists.
The people who came to the meeting must be made to realize this. They must understand what is at stake. You mentioned a demonstration of force--
Yes.
Yes.
Would such, a demonstration be possible before the meeting?
Would such, a demonstration be possible before the meeting?
Yes -- of course.
Yes -- of course.
Something that would dramatize for them and for their people the seriousness of the situation. Something that would affect the entire planet.

Something dramatic -- but not destructive. It's quite an interesting problem. Would day after tomorrow be all right? Say about noon?
Bet he is, Mom. Bet he's out looking for that space man.
I think we've all been hearing too much about "space men."
Can I help you look for the space man? Can I? I know what he looks like! He's got a square head -- and, three great big eyes!
That's enough, Bobby. I think it's time you went to bed.
Hi Mom!
Hello, darling. Good evening, Mr. Carpenter.
Did you have a nice day, dear?
Boy, we had a swell time. Didn't we, Mr. Carpenter?
Come on, Bobby. Time to go to bed.
Mom -- why does Mr. Carpenter have to go down to the police station?
Mom -- why does Mr. Carpenter have to go down to the police station?
I -- I don't know, dear... Perhaps there's some mistake.
We sure had fun today. We saw the space ship and we went to see Professor Barnhardt -- and--
Professor Barnhardt.
Professor Barnhardt.
Yeah, sure. Mom, do I have to go to school tomorrow?
Yeah, sure. Mom, do I have to go to school tomorrow?
Of course, dear.
Of course, dear.
Aw, gee, Mom -- I had plans to play with Mr. Carpenter.
Go to bed, darling. You can finish that in the morning.
Okay.
Bobby -- I think it would be better if we didn't see quite so much of Mr. Carpenter
Gee, why, Mom? He's my best friend... And he's awful good in arithmetic. He even helps Professor Barnhardt.
Gee, why, Mom? He's my best friend... And he's awful good in arithmetic. He even helps Professor Barnhardt.
Did you and Mr. Carpenter really go to see Professor Barnhardt?
Did you and Mr. Carpenter really go to see Professor Barnhardt?
Sure we did! He wasn't there but we went to see him. And Mr. Carpenter showed him how to do his arithmetic.
Mom -- is there something wrong with Mr. Carpenter?
What do you mean, dear?
What do you mean, dear?
I mean -- on account of that policeman last night. You think he's a bank robber, maybe? Or a gangster?
I mean -- on account of that policeman last night. You think he's a bank robber, maybe? Or a gangster?
No, dear, of course not. He's a very nice man. I Just think he might prefer to be left alone. Now you get to bed and forget about it. 'Night, darling.
Bobby--! What are you doing up at this hour?
I couldn't go to sleep, Mom. I had to tell you!
I couldn't go to sleep, Mom. I had to tell you!
Tell me what?
Tell me what?
I followed Mr. Carpenter -- right after you left -- and, gee, Mom, where do you think he went? Right into the space ship!
I followed Mr. Carpenter -- right after you left -- and, gee, Mom, where do you think he went? Right into the space ship!
Now, Bobby, just a minute--
Now, Bobby, just a minute--
Honest, Mom, I saw him. It just opened up and he walked right in. And that great big iron man was moving around!
Honest, Mom, I saw him. It just opened up and he walked right in. And that great big iron man was moving around!
Bobby, you've been dreaming again.
Bobby, you've been dreaming again.
No, I haven't, Mom. I promise you... I saw it!
Now think back hard. You didn't follow Mr. Carpenter at all, did you? You haven't even been out of the house.
Yes, I have!
Yes, I have!
You didn't really see the space ship. You just thought you did.
He gave these to you?
Well, not exactly. I gave him two dollars.
Gee, Mom, do you think maybe he's a diamond smuggler?
Come on, darling -- we're going up to bed.
Oh, boy -- can I, Mom?
Yes, dear. Come on now. Bobby, your shoes are soaking!
Yes, dear. Come on now. Bobby, your shoes are soaking!
Yeah -- the grass was kind of wet.
Are you an FBI man?
No -- I'm afraid not.
Bobby -- who's the greatest man in America today?
Gee -- I don't know... The space man, I guess.
Gee -- I don't know... The space man, I guess.
I was speaking of earth men. I meant the greatest philosopher -- the greatest thinker.
Well -- Professor Barnhardt, I guess. He's the greatest scientist in the world.
He lives here in Washington, doesn't he?
He lives here in Washington, doesn't he?
Sure. Right near where my mother works.
Sure. Right near where my mother works.
Where is that?
Where is that?
Department of Commerce. She's a secretary. They have a man they call the Secretary, but he isn't at all. My mother's a real secretary. Mr. Carpenter -- now can we go see the space ship?
Boy, I'll bet he's strong. I bet he could knock down a whole building.
I shouldn't be at all surprised.
Gee, I'd like to get inside and see how it works. What do you think makes it go?
Well -- atomic power, I would imagine.
Well -- atomic power, I would imagine.
I thought that was only for bombs.

No. It's for a lot of other things, too.
No. It's for a lot of other things, too.
You think it can go faster than an F- 36?
You think it can go faster than an F- 36?
Yes -- I think so.
Maybe four thousand miles an hour. And outside the Earth's atmosphere a good deal faster.
Gee! How could they make a landing?
Gee! How could they make a landing?
Well -- there are several ways to reduce landing speed. You see, the velocity--
You think they'll ever find him?
I don't know, Bobby. I'm inclined to doubt it.
I don't know, Bobby. I'm inclined to doubt it.
Mr. Carpenter -- what does velocity mean?
Mr. Carpenter -- what does velocity mean?
Velocity is the time rate of change of position.
Bobby -- I have an idea. Let's go see Professor Barnhardt and find out how he talks.
You're just kidding, aren't you?
You're just kidding, aren't you?
Wouldn't you like to meet him?
Wouldn't you like to meet him?
Well, sure I would, but -- Aw, I'll bet you'd be scared.
Well, sure I would, but -- Aw, I'll bet you'd be scared.
We can scare him more than he can scare us.
What does that mean?
It's a problem in celestial mechanics.
It's a problem in celestial mechanics.
Bet he's the only one in the world knows the answer.
Bet he's the only one in the world knows the answer.
He doesn't know the answer. And he'll never get it that way.
Did all these people die in wars?
Sure. Didn't you ever hear of Arlington Cemetery?
Sure. Didn't you ever hear of Arlington Cemetery?
No -- I'm afraid not.
No -- I'm afraid not.

I'll tell you, Bobby -- I've been away for a long time. Very far away.

Is it different where you've been? Don't they have places like this?
Is it different where you've been? Don't they have places like this?
They have cemeteries. But not like this one... You see, they don't have any wars.
Go to the movies.
All right.
All right.
No foolin'? Will you?
No foolin'? Will you?
Certainly. Tell me, Bobby -- do you have to have money to go there?
I've got some money. My mother gave me two dollars.
No -- I want to take you to the movies. Do you think they'd accept these?
Gee -- those look like diamonds!
Some places that's what people use for money. They're easy to carry -- and they don't wear out.
Some places that's what people use for money. They're easy to carry -- and they don't wear out.
Bet they're worth about a million dollars.

Would you give me your two dollars for a couple of them?

Well, sure, but--
Let's not say anything to my mother about this, Mr. Carpenter.
Why not, Bobby?
Why not, Bobby?
She doesn't like me to steal from people.
Mrs. Benson -- this is Mr. Brady.
Mr. Brady's a cop.
We certainly did.
We went to the movies -- and we had ice cream cones -- and we went to see Daddy--
Aw, gee -- we didn't finish our story.
We'll finish it tomorrow... Goodnight, Bobby.
We'll finish it tomorrow... Goodnight, Bobby.
Goodnight.
All you have to remember is, first find the common denominator -- then subtract.
Thanks, Mr. Carpenter.
Thanks, Mr. Carpenter.
I'll say goodnight again.
Bobby -- have you a flashlight?
Yeah -- sure. It's a real Boy Scout flashlight.
What do you want it for, Mr. Carpenter?
Why -- the light in my room went out. Thank you, Bobby. Goodnight.

About five months -- your months.

You must have come a long way.

About 250 million of your miles.
Naturally we're very curious to know where it is you come from.
From another planet. Let's just say that we're neighbors.
It's rather difficult for us to think of another planet as a neighbor.

Perhaps if you could explain a little--
Perhaps if you could explain a little--
I intend to explain. To all the nations -- simultaneously. How do we proceed, Mr. Harley?
We could call a special meeting of the General Assembly... But of course the UN doesn't represent all of the nations.
Then why not a meeting of all the Chiefs of State?
Then why not a meeting of all the Chiefs of State?
Believe me, you don't understand. They wouldn't sit down at the same table.
I will make that recommendation to the President. I must tell you in all honesty that I'm extremely dubious about the results.
Apparently I'm not as cynical about Earth's people as you are.
Apparently I'm not as cynical about Earth's people as you are.
I've been dealing in Earth's politics a good deal longer than you have. Goodnight, sir.
Good afternoon. I'm glad to see you up and around.
Thank you... Have you any news?
Thank you... Have you any news?
Not very good news, I'm afraid. The President accepted your suggestion and cabled the invitations for a meeting last night. Let me read you some of the replies. "The Premier wishes to inform the Government of the United States that it will be impossible for him to attend the meeting suggested by the President unless the meeting is held in Moscow."

I'm afraid my people haven't. I'm very sorry -- I wish it were otherwise.
Before making any decisions, I think I should get out among your people -- become familiar with the basis for these strange, unreasoning attitudes.
Under the circumstances I'm afraid that will be impossible.
We're all set. I picked up some sandwiches and put gas in the car. And the radio's still busted, so me can forget about the space man for today.
There's only one thing -- I haven't been able to arrange for anyone to stay with Bobby. I don't suppose we could take him with us?

I hope Mr. Carpenter won't think I'm intruding.
Oh, Tom, that was awful.
I'm sorry. I guess I'm just tired of hearing about Mr. Carpenter. I don't like the way he's attached himself to you and Bobby. After all, what do you know about him?
He's not there. But look what I found in his room
Is it real?
Is it real?
Looks real to me.
I wonder if we ought to--

I'm at Bleeker's getting an appraisal on that diamond. I thought we might have lunch together.
I -- I'm afraid I can't -- not right now. Can I talk to you later?. Yes, that'll be fine. 'Bye.
Tom -- I've been trying to get you all afternoon--
Come on in.
I've got some terrific news about your friend, Mr. Carpenter.
What about him?
What about him?
Helen, he's the man from the space ship! I had that diamond checked at three different places. Nobody on earth's ever seen a stone like that! After what Bobby told us, that's enough for me. Why is it nobody knows anything about him? Why hasn't he got any money?

All right, Tom -- it's true. I know it's true.

Why not? Somebody's got to get rid of him.
Tom, you mustn't -- ! You don't know what you're doing! It isn't just you and Mr. Carpenter. The rest of the world, is involved!
I don't care about the rest of the world!
You'll feel different when you see my picture in the papers.
I feel different right now.

You wait and see. You're going to marry a big hero!

I'm not going to marry anybody.
I don't know how to thank you.
I enjoyed every minute of it.
Everyone seems so--
Jittery is the word.

He has his homework to keep him occupied.

Mr. Carpenter -- this is none of my business, but -- why did that detective come here last night?
Oh -- they just wanted to ask me a few questions. Bobby and I tried to see Professor Barnhardt in the afternoon, but he wasn't in. Apparently they thought I was looking for secrets of some kind.
Excuse me. I was just going up to my room.
Goodnight, Mr. Carpenter.
Mr. Carpenter, I-- Goodnight.
Goodnight, my dear.
Oh -- hello--
May I see you for a minute?

I -- I didn't really pay much attention-- Bobby has such an active imagination.
Did you believe what he told you? I have a reason for asking this -- a very important reason.
What is it you want?
Before I ask you to be honest with me, perhaps I should be completely honest with you--
What happened?
What time is it?
Just twelve.
We'll be stuck here for a little while -- about thirty minutes.

Why not?
You see -- the electricity's been neutralized -- all over the world.
You hold great hope for this meeting.
I can see no other hope for your planet. If the meeting should fail, then I'm afraid there is no hope.
It must be twelve-thirty.
Yes -- Just exactly.
Where are you going now?
Back to the boardinghouse. I'll be safe there for the afternoon -- and I can keep an eye on Bobby. He's the only other person who knows anything about--
No, wait a minute -- there's someone else.
Who?
Who?
Tom... He was there last night when Bobby told me what he saw.
I'm sure Barnhardt can arrange to hide me until the meeting.
Where is the meeting going to be?
Where is the meeting going to be?
At the ship.
It's only a few blocks to Barnhardt's.

Remember those words.
Hello.

He'll have you -- and Tom.

No. That's all finished.
No. That's all finished.
I'm sorry.

I think I'm very lucky. You don't always get a chance to recognize a mistake before you make it.
How dare you write on that blackboard! Do you realize the Professor has been working on that problem for weeks?
He'll catch on to it in no time now.

We came to see Professor Barnhardt.
We came to see Professor Barnhardt.
Well, he's not here. And he won't be back till this evening. I think you'd better leave now. Unruffled, Klaatu turns to the desk and scribbles something on a scratch pad. He tears off the piece of paper and hands it to Hilda.

You might keep this. I think the professor will want to get in touch with me.
Is it worth anything?
I have never seen such a stone. Will you please tell me where it came from?

That's what I wanted you to tell me.

There are no diamonds like this -- any place in the world.
You sure about that?
Would you like to sell it?
Would you like to sell it?
No -- no, thanks.
No -- no, thanks.
I'd give you a very good price.
The Professor's secretary says she found you in Barnhardt's room, making marks on his blackboard.
I was only trying to be helpful. He was having difficulty with a problem.
Oh, I see. He was having trouble and you were helping him out.
That's right.
That's right.
I suppose you know that Barnhardt does a lot of secret work for the Army.

It's really quite simple... The three- body problem, you know.
Your name's Carpenter -- that right? Any identification, Mr. Carpenter? Driver's license -- social security number?
No -- I'm afraid not.
No -- I'm afraid not.
Well, how do I know who you are?
Well, how do I know who you are?
You don't.
Okay -- book him and get him fixed up. Looks like everybody's goin' nuts.
They would have killed this man?

People get hysterical enough, they do anything. Look, Mr. Carpenter -- if you can't identify yourself, I got to send you over to the Army.

How long will that take?
How long will that take?
They can tell right away. They've got a couple of doctors who saw this man in the hospital. Take him over to G2.
May I suggest that you call the Professor?
Get going, will you, Brady -- before I get mad!
Just passing through Santa Carla?
No, I'm a resident as of today and you'll probably be seeing a lot of me... I've been collecting comic books all my life... perhaps you'd like to see my collection?
I don't like horror comics.
This one could save your life.
How do you like Santa Carla?
It's a pretty cool place if you're a Martian.
Yeah, you think we just work in a comic book store for our dad, huh?
This isn't a comic book store, right. It's a bakery.
We're fighters for Truth, Justice, and the American Way.
You better get some fresh air.
I don't like horror comics.
Think of this more as a survival manual... there's our number on the back, and pray that you never need to call us.

They wouldn't be out in the daytime.
Exactly how many vampires have you actually destroyed?

We don't ride with vampires.

Fine! Stay here!

You gotta drive!
Well... we blew Plan A.
Time to activate Plan B.

What's Plan B?
We've been aware of some very serious vampire activity in this town for a long time.
Santa Carla has become a haven for the undead.

As a matter of fact, we're almost certain that ghouls and werewolves occupy high positions at City Hall.

The nightcrawler. The bloodsucker.

El Vampiro.
Should I run him through?
I've only got one question for you, and I want an honest answer. Have you taken any human victims yet?
Shut up!
We unraveled in the face of the enemy!

They pulled a mind-scramble on us, man! It wasn't our fault! They opened their eyes and talked!
They're looking at us.
They're gonna book us.
Good.
That's just the way we like it.
Did you see that sucker burn?!
Man, we totally annihilated his night-stalkin' ass!

C'mon, Star. Climb on.
C'mon, Star. Climb on.
Star?...
I can't beat a Triumph.
You don't have to beat me, Michael. Just try to keep up.
We were gonna grab some food.
Good idea. Marko. We're hungry.
So how do you like those maggots, Michael?
What?...
What?...
You're eating maggots. How do they taste?
Don't! Stop!
Why? They're only noodles.
I'm my own man.
Get your bike. We're going someplace.
What's going' on?
What's goin' on, Marko?
Where is she?!
Hey, take it easy.
Hey, take it easy.
Where's Star, David?!
Where's Star, David?!
If you ever want to see Star again, then you better come with us.
What is this, David?
You're one of us, now -- aren't you?
Where you going?
For a ride.
For a ride.
With him?
With him?
Yeah.
C'mon, Michael. I want to go.
No. Stick around.
Leave him alone.
Sorry, Michael. No hard feelings, huh? Here. Try these noodles.
Look.
You're almost one of us now, Michael.
You can't kill me, Star.
I will, David!
I will, David!
No, Star. Put it down. Put it down.
And these Archies should be over here with the Richie Rich's.
Where the hell are you from, Kryton???

You think you're cool, don't you? You think you know what's really happening, don't you? Well, you don't know shit, buddy.
This is just our cover. We're dedicated to a higher purpose.
Now I get it... you're like those people in the airport trying to get you to give them money. You're part of a cult.
Bad breath? Long fingernails?
His fingernails are longer, but he always has bad breath.
Get yourself a good sharp stake and drive it through his heart.
I can't do that!
I have something to tell you guys. Not only is my own brother showing systems of being a vampire... but now I'm convinced my mother's <u>dating</u> one!
That is very probable. What's your reasoning?
That is very probable. What's your reasoning?
Well... he only shows up at the store after dark. And today, his dog attacked my mom. Listen to this. From <u>Vampires</u> <u>Everywhere</u>... 'Vampires require a daytime protector -- a <u>Guardian</u> -- to watch over them as they sleep. For it is during the day that the vampire is most vulnerable. Since they hold sway over animals, <u>fierce dogs -- the hounds of Hell</u>
I wish they were vampires so I could nuke them in their hearts.
How do you know they're not?
He's not glowing.
Hit the lights again.
He's telling the truth! Aren't you, Michael?
To free you, we must destroy the leader of the vampires.
Just so you know: If you try to stop us, or vamp-out in any way, I'll stake you without thinking twice about it.
Chill out Edgar.
What's that smell!?
Vampires, my friend. Vampires.
I thought they'd be in coffins.
That's exactly what this place is. One great big coffin. Let's stake 'em.
Oh, no...
What?
What?
There's a cop behind us.
No, Nanook! Quiet!
Your dog knows flesh-eaters when he smells 'em!
We don't have one yet. And we only have two and a half hours to come up with one.
What happens in tow and a half hours?
What happens in tow and a half hours?
The dun goes down and they'll be comin' for us.
Of course not!
If you're telling the truth, it means we can save you.
David.
I don't want names! Just lead me to him. Where's their nest?
I don't want names! Just lead me to him. Where's their nest?
I'll take you there.
I said, <u>I'll take you there</u>. Nobody's going near Star without me.
Okay, okay.
Don't go out there! Stop him!
Sam, don't --
Lucy, you're the only woman I ever knew didn't improve her situation by getting divorced.
A big legal war wasn't going to improve anybody's situation. We've all been through enough. Besides I was raised better than that. Thanks for having us, Dad.
Ouch, my hair...
When I dressed like you do now, you threw me out of the house. I used to hate your short hair and your uptight suits... then I went ahead and married one... I went Yuppie and you became a hippie... Were still out of synch.
I can't sleep with the closet door open, either. Not even a crack. Your father doesn't mind, though. It could be wide open for all he cared. I think one of the reasons I divorced him was because he never believed... in the horror... of the <u>closet monster</u>!
Closet monster!?
Dad! Don't sneak up on people like that!
It's called the Indian walk. Walkin' without makin' a sound.
Smells good. When do we eat?
I told Max eight o'clock.
I told Max eight o'clock.

You have a T.V.?
You have a T.V.?
No, I just like to read the <u>T.V.</u> <u>Guide</u>. Read the <u>T.V. Guide</u>, you don't need a T.V...
Thanks, Grandpa...
Lots more where he came from.
Grandpa, stop doin' the Indian Walk!
Gotta keep in practice. It's a dyin' art.

I thought we were goin' into town.

I guess so. She said not to be late.

I better get cleaned up, then.
Hi... I'm Laddie.
This is Michael.
I had the dream again about <u>them</u>.
Who, Laddie?
Who, Laddie?
I know it was them, Star. I'm sure of it. He was working in the yard -- hammering something. The yard was big with lots of grass. There was no boardwalk and no ocean. She was bringing him something cold to drink... and had red hair. I was there, too. And a dog -- but I don't know its name. I was running and

No, Laddie. It was a <u>memory</u>.
You didn't tell David?
No. Just you.
No. Just you.
Promise me you'll keep it that way. You're not like the others, Laddie. You're like me. I can still remember, too.
You like Michael.
I like Michael.
I like Michael.
You better not like him too much.
Still mad at me?
For what.
For what.
For everything.
He looks dead.
He's just a deep sleeper.

He's not breathing, Mom.

I watch him all day. The only time I have more myself is at night. Let Grandpa watch him.
Grandpa has plans of his own. Michael, I want you to do this. Everybody has been bending over backwards for you. You come home late. You sleep in to the middle of the day -- Sam is always alone. You do exactly what you want... tonight do what I want for a change.
Okay?
Okay.
Sure.
Does that mean we are, or we aren't?
Does that mean we are, or we aren't?
We are...

I'm tired now.

Guys, I know it hasn't been easy... the divorce and now the move... but I think you're really going to like living in Santa Carla...
Mom, there's an amusement park right on the beach!
That's the boardwalk, Sam.
That's the boardwalk, Sam.
Can we go now, huh? LUCY Maybe later. Grandpa's expecting us.
Tell them to get something to eat.
I thought we were poor.

Not that poor.

You've heard this story before?
You've heard this story before?
So many times, I'm starting to think it happened to me.
Help me, Mom. Help.
Soon.
He met a girl.
I guess no one cares what I got a job.

What's wrong? Tell me.
What's wrong? Tell me.
We can't talk about it on the phone.
Sam! What happened!? You had me scared to death. Are you all right?
Sorry, Mom. It was a mistake. I thought I saw something out the window. I was reading this horror comic and I guess I go a little carried away...
Where's Michael?
He's already gone to bed.
Can I sleep in here with you tonight?
In here?
In here?
Do you mind? It was a real scary comic.
Do you mind? It was a real scary comic.

Oh, no. Now what?
Must be a circuit breaker.

Say hello to Thorn.
Hi, Thorn.
You're cute, Max.
I know. It's so 'Eighties.' It's the Cute Decade.

I don't want to fight with you, Lucy. Come on. Let's give it one more try. Dinner at my house, tomorrow night. I'm cooking.
Maybe this is the night where everything finally goes right for a change.
I hope so.
Something the matter?
No, no. Just worrying about my boys -- as usual.

Max... what are you talking about?
It was all going to be so perfect, Lucy. One big happy family. My boys... and <u>yours</u>.
Will somebody please tell me what this is all about!?
It's you I was after all along, Lucy. To be our day time guardian. I knew if we could bring Sam and Michael into the faimly, there'd be no way you could say no.
How about a little Parmesan cheese on that?
Okay, Sam. Thanks.
Does it burn?
Burn?? Are you kidding? It's freezing!
I am?
Yeah. I'm not trying to replace your Dad... or steal your Mom. I just want to be your friend.
But you passed the test!
Michael invited me in. Never invite a vampire into your house. It renders you powerless.

Are you hungry? Wanna get something to eat?
Okay.
Ouch.
Don't be a baby. That didn't hurt and you know it.
I wouldn't have given my Mom such a hard time about moving here if I'd known I was going to meet you.

Tonight. At the boardwalk...
I have to talk to you. Can I come up?

Yes... and I'm to blame for it. If you hadn't met me... if I hadn't liked you... I tried to warn you...
That night in the cave -- that wasn't wine they gave me to drink... it was blood! David's blood. I'm one of them, Star! I'm just like them!
That night in the cave -- that wasn't wine they gave me to drink... it was blood! David's blood. I'm one of them, Star! I'm just like them!
Not yet... You're like Laddie and me... Half-vampires... You're not a full vampire until you've made your first kill... You were supposed to be mine... but I couldn't, Michael.
Not yet... You're like Laddie and me... Half-vampires... You're not a full vampire until you've made your first kill... You were supposed to be mine... but I couldn't, Michael.
Why not?
Why not?
Because I love you...
Because I love you...
Then it's not too late for us...
Then it's not too late for us...
It's not too late for you to be saved... but each night... it becomes harder and harder for me to resist killing...
It's not too late for you to be saved... but each night... it becomes harder and harder for me to resist killing...
I know, I've felt it...
I know, I've felt it...
I'm weak... Soon I'll need to feed.
David's looking for me... I have to go.
You're not going anywhere... Sam...
You've got to put this on.
Take laddie.
Take laddie.
Huh?
Huh?
Save Laddie first.
They'll be coming for Laddie and me, won't they?
They'll be coming for <u>all</u> of us.
It's gone. I feel it!
So do I!
What!? He <u>can</u> and I <u>can't</u>?! No fair!!
That's okay, Mom. I can see it later. I'll help you unload.
This is kind of a cool place.
I'm so excited I just can't hide it. I'm about to lode control and I think I like it.
I'm so excited I just can't hide it. I'm about to lode control and I think I like it.
Will you give Mom a break?
Grandpa does not own a T.V. Have you noticed? There's no T.V. Santa Carla has no malls, no Cineplexes and now I won't even have MTV. I will not know anything hip happening anymore.
Hey, Sam, we're flat broke.
Hey, Sam, we're flat broke.
Even poor people have T.V.s
This room is mine.
I was here first.
I was here first.
Okay. I'll flip you for it.
You're beautiful.
Wanna change my hair, my clothes, my face.
Where are we going?
Nowhere.
Nowhere.
Then what's the rush? You're chasing that girl, why don't you just admit it? I'm at the mercy of your sex glands!
Then what's the rush? You're chasing that girl, why don't you just admit it? I'm at the mercy of your sex glands!
Don't you have something better to do than follow me around all night?
Mom, you hitched all the way to Berkeley once, remember?
Mom, just give me five more minutes. Just five minutes, okay?
Do I have to do this?
Come on, Sam, you know before there were malls there was 'like the ocean.'
Go away.
You're supposed to watch me and entertain me, and make me appreciate the brief but happy years of childhood.
You're supposed to watch me and entertain me, and make me appreciate the brief but happy years of childhood.
Entertain yourself.
What did <u>you</u> do last night? You look wasted.
I can't remember much after the Chinese food that looked like maggots.
You don't suppose Grandpa's an alien, do you?
What would that make Mom?
What would that make Mom?
You're right... not even to mention you and me.
Did you spill something?
No. Why?
No. Why?
The bottoms of your feet are covered with salt.
I told you it was pretty weird Chinese food.
Wanna go to the comic book store?
Wanna go to the comic book store?
No.
Mom's home?...
No. On the phone.
I'm making you a sandwich.
Don't bother.
Lose the earring, Michael. It's not happening. It's just not happening.
Piss off.
Piss off.
You have such a great personality, Michael. You should open your own charm school.
Michael?
Don't turn on the light.
What happened, Michael!?
Nanook...
Nanook...
What about Nonook? What have you done to Nanook?! What have you done to my dog, you asshole?!
What about Nonook? What have you done to Nanook?! What have you done to my dog, you asshole?!
Nothing! I didn't hurt him. <u>He</u> bit <u>me</u>! This is <u>my</u> blood!
What did you to do him, Michael? Why did he bite you?
He was protecting <u>you</u>!
What??
Look at your reflection in the mirror!!
We've got to stick together, Sam. You've got to help me.
What about Mom?
What about Mom?
No! We can't tell Mom! Please, Sam. Don't tell her.
No! We can't tell Mom! Please, Sam. Don't tell her.
I don't know, Michael. This is not like breaking a lamp or getting a 'D'.
I don't know, Michael. This is not like breaking a lamp or getting a 'D'.
Just for a few days, Sam. Give me a chance to work this out by myself.
It's that girl from the boardwalk. Is she one of them?
I don't know.
Star.
Don't kill anybody until we get back to you...
Who are you calling?
The Marines.
Michael! Get behind the wheel.
Huh?...
What's the matter?
I... I don't feel any differently. Do you?
Sixteen.
And the horse you rode in on. Sixteen for how long?! You can't predict this time of year...
What do you want from us?
Just listen.
Pretty nasty out, Mac. Thirty-five knots.
Screw it, I'm going up anyway.
All right... Box of dynamite... box of thermite... three shotguns... box of flares... two flare guns... thirty cans gasoline... and a case of alcohol.
Let's load 'em.
Maybe dinner.
Dogs don't eat each other.
Dogs don't eat each other.
I know.
Where these tracks headed?
Nowhere... Just straight to the ocean.
What do you mean "got" to the dog?
It was a life form that was able to imitate and reproduce, whatever it ate or absorbed, cell for cell.
Clark, did you notice anything strange about that dog? Just anything at all? Any little thing?
No. Just that he recovered real quick... That night when I found him in the rec room, he had already scraped off his bandage. Before I put him with the others, I redressed his wound and noticed it had healed up real good...
That night?
Yeah.
Yeah.
What was he doing in the rec room?
What was he doing in the rec room?
Well, after I worked on him -- thought I'd let him rest. Left the room for a bit. When I came back, he was gone.
Well, after I worked on him -- thought I'd let him rest. Left the room for a bit. When I came back, he was gone.
Well, where was he? Where did he go?
Well, where was he? Where did he go?
Don't know. Looked for him for a bit... couldn't find him.
Don't know. Looked for him for a bit... couldn't find him.
You're saying he wasn't put into the kennel until the night?
How long were you with the dog? Alone, I mean?
Ah... He was hurt bad. Bullet nicked an artery... I don't know... An hour... hour and a half...
What the hell you looking at me like that for?
Nothing. Nothing at all.
Was that dog, the Norwegian dog?
I just can't comprehend any of this. It was just a dog.
Couldn't make much of it myself.
I've asked him to try and locate the site. Okay with you?
I've asked him to try and locate the site. Okay with you?
Sure. You think there's a connection?
Sure. You think there's a connection?
Maybe.
Look, I know it's hard to believe...
So what's our problem?
So what's our problem?
Well... there's still some cell activity... it's not entirely dead yet.
... It could have gotten to somebody...
Anybody sick?
Anybody sick?
No, I... I don't mean infection... or disease...
Listen to me, Garry. Please...
If the weather clears enough before we reach anybody -- I'm sending you and Doc up to MacMurdo...
Don't you understand?! That Thing didn't want to become a dog...
Damn you, Blair! You've already got everybody half-hysterical around here.
Damn you, Blair! You've already got everybody half-hysterical around here.
You can't let anybody leave!
You can't let anybody leave!
I've got six dead Norwegians on my hands, a burned up flying saucer, and we've just destroyed the scientific find of the century. Now fuck off!
Whatever that Norwegian dog was... It... It was capable of changing its form... ... when it attacked our dog... it somehow was able to digest... or... absorb it... and in the process shaped its own cells to imitate our dog's cells exactly... ... This for instance isn't dog at all -- it's imitation... We got to it before it had time to finish or...
Finish what?
Finish what?
... I think the whole process would have taken an hour... maybe more. And then I suppose both would have changed back to dog form.
What you doin'?
Nobody's getting in here. You can tell them all that!
Nobody's getting in here. You can tell them all that!
Well, who the hell you think wants to get in there with you?
Now why'd you go and...
And I don't want any more food with sedatives in it. I know what you're up to. Don't think I don't. And if anyone tries to get in here -- I've got rope. I'll hang myself before it gets to me.
And I don't want any more food with sedatives in it. I know what you're up to. Don't think I don't. And if anyone tries to get in here -- I've got rope. I'll hang myself before it gets to me.
You promise?
Too damn dangerous.
... You think this Thing wants to become an animal? Dogs can't make it 1000 miles to the sea. No skua gulls to imitate this time of year... No penguins this far inland... Don't you understand?! It wanted to become us!
... Can't you see...? If one cell of this Thing got out it could imitate every living thing on Earth. Nothing could stop it! Nothing!
Look Blair, maybe you're right about this. But we've got to be rational. We've got to talk this over. I'm unarmed and I'm coming in.
Look Blair, maybe you're right about this. But we've got to be rational. We've got to talk this over. I'm unarmed and I'm coming in.
No, you're not! I don't trust any of you!
How you doin', old boy?
I don't know who to trust.
I don't know who to trust.
Know what you mean, Blair. Trust is a tough thing to come by these days. Just trust in the Lord.
Know what you mean, Blair. Trust is a tough thing to come by these days. Just trust in the Lord.
Watch Clark.
Watch Clark.
What?
What?
Watch him close. Ask him why he didn't kennel the dog.
I've changed my mind... I'd... I'd like to come back inside... I don't want to stay out here any more... Funny things... I hear funny things out here.
Have you come across Fuchs?
Have you come across Fuchs?
Fuchs...? No, it's not Fuchs... You must let me back in... I won't harm anyone... I promise...
Fuchs...? No, it's not Fuchs... You must let me back in... I won't harm anyone... I promise...
We'll see...
Happens all the time, man. They're falling out of the skies like flies. Government knows all about it... Chariots of the Gods, man... They practically own South America. I mean they taught the Incas everything they knew...
Cool it, Palmer!!
Childs, where's that magneto from Chopper One?
Ain't it there?
What?
Don't walk behind me.
Auxiliary light cables...? Been cut.
Cut, bullshit. Been pulled apart.
Somebody broke in.
Now who'd go and do...
Childs!!
Let go of me...
Let go of me...
Don't get near 'em. The plants! They're alive. Those things can imitate anything...
Don't get near 'em. The plants! They're alive. Those things can imitate anything...
What's it going to do, being a plant?
We got to burn 'em.
Now hold on, you dumb...
Why didn't it imitate Fuchs? Isn't that its number -- to get more recruits.
Wasn't enough time. Generator was out, what...? Thirty minutes. Takes the bastards an hour, maybe two to absorb somebody.
Could have been anytime. Anywhere.
If it did get to him.
Let's open it.
Hell no.
Let's open it. Now...
Why you so damn anxious to let him in here...
Why you so damn anxious to let him in here...
He's so close. Maybe our best chance to blow him away.
He's so close. Maybe our best chance to blow him away.
No. Just let him freeze out there.
You catch anything he was saying?
Am I starting to look Norwegian to you, Bwana?
I suppose... well, it's possible someone might have lifted it from me. But...
That key ring of yours is always hooked to your belt. Now how could somebody get to it without you knowing?
That key ring of yours is always hooked to your belt. Now how could somebody get to it without you knowing?
Look, I haven't been near that... that refrigerator.
I said where? Where'd you go?!
Was dark... find a light...
Was dark... find a light...
You lying bastard...
Lighten your load, sucker. You ain't the judge and executioner around here!
Who you trying to protect, mutherfucker? I'm telling you this S.O.B. could be one of them.
Childs! That a fuse?
No. The generator. You got the auxiliary box just off the kitchen. Get to it. Where's the damn flashlight? You fellas okay over there?
Cut that out, Copper. Nauls? What's taking you?!
I'm working it! Nothing's happening!
I'm working it! Nothing's happening!
That's impossible, man! Okay, Clark, out of the john where I can see you!
That's impossible, man! Okay, Clark, out of the john where I can see you!
It's shorted out or something!
It's shorted out or something!
Clark, you come on out here!!
Somebody's taken it. I can't find it!
Clark, you want me to come in after you?!
Cut him loose of the line up by his shack.
Cut him loose?
Cut him loose?
When we were up poking around his place... I found this...
What's happening?
Childs, you got the torch? You get your ass in here!!
Torch it over there!
The dogs?
The dogs?
Screw the dogs!! Torch it!!
MacReady!
Look, I'm just guessing...
Look, I'm just guessing...
Well, go on.
... So it crashes, and this guy, whoever he is, gets thrown out, or walks out, and ends up freezing.
I just can't believe this voodoo bullshit. You believe this voodoo bullshit, Blair?
Yeah, they dig him up and cart him back. He gets thawed out, wakes up and scares the shit out of them. And they get into one hell of a brawl...
Now how's this motherfucker wake up after thousands of years in the ice, huh?
Now how's this motherfucker wake up after thousands of years in the ice, huh?
I don't know how. Because he's different than we are. Because he's a space guy. What do you want from me, anyway. Go ask Blair.
I don't know how. Because he's different than we are. Because he's a space guy. What do you want from me, anyway. Go ask Blair.
You buy any of this, Blair?
I can get maybe another five or six feet out of it.
That's good enough.
Where's the other half?
Probably the next meal.
What we going to do?!
How the fuck do I know?!
Torch them!!
But...
But...
He's gone already! Do it!
What do we do about those three?
We got morphine, don't we.
MacReady!
What?
What?
Garry's missing!
Garry's missing!
Oh, shit! Well, hang on!
Oh, shit! Well, hang on!
Gee, thanks!
Well, who says I want you going with me?!
Cut the bullshit... Okay, Sanchez, you come with us. Norris... you stay here... Any of them move -- you fry 'em. And if you hear anything, anything at all you let loose the siren. We all meet back here in twenty minutes regardless. And everybody watch whoever you're with. Real close.
... Nothing human could have made it back here in this weather without a guideline...
... Where is everybody?! I'm half frostbit!
What are you doing?
You're a dead man, MacReady -- or a dead whatever the hell you are!
We found your clothes -- the ones you tried to burn.
What clothes?
What clothes?
You been made, MacReady.
... Ever occur to the jury that anybody could have gotten to some of my clothes and stuck them up...
We ain't buying that.
Palmer, you and Copper tie everyone down. Real tight.
What for?
What for?
For your health.
You ain't tying me up.
Then I'll have to kill you.
Then I'll have to kill you.
Then kill me.
We should have jumped his ass.
Now Copper, you tie Palmer up.
Load of bullshit.
We'll see. Let's try Clark.
Spaceship of some kind.
Smart S.O.B. He put it together piece by piece.
I think so.
What do you mean "you think so?"
Not the only one.
The fire's got the temperature way up all over camp... won't last long though.
The fire's got the temperature way up all over camp... won't last long though.
Neither will we.
Neither will we.
Maybe we should try and fix the radio... try and get some help.
Maybe we should try and fix the radio... try and get some help.
Maybe we shouldn't.
Maybe we shouldn't.
Then we'll never make it.
Maybe we shouldn't make it.
If you're worried about anything, let's take that blood test of yours.
If you're worried about anything, let's take that blood test of yours.
If we've got any surprises for each other -- we shouldn't be in any condition to do anything about it. You play chess?
Screw regulations! Four guys could be crawling around on their bellies out there!
So, I don't want to end up crawling around with them when we go down.
My God, what in hell happened here?
Come on, Copper.
Hey, Sweden!!!
They're not Swedish, goddamn it, they're Norwegian, MacRe --
Anything?
All in Norwegian.
What are you doing?
Could be important work. Might as well bring it back.
Could be important work. Might as well bring it back.
It's getting late. Hurry it. I'm going to check the last few rooms.
Well, who's got access to it?
I guess I'm the only one.
Would that test have worked?
I think so.
Now hold him.
I'm a real light sleeper, Childs...
I'm a real light sleeper, Childs...
Enough, MacReady!
And if anyone tries to wake me...
Damn you, MacReady!
I guess you're okay.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Didn't think you'd use that fibrillator on Norris if you were one of them.
... Guys as crazy as that could have done a lot of damage to their own before they got to us.
Nothing we can do about that.
Nothing we can do about that.
Yes, there is. I'd like to go up.
Yes, there is. I'd like to go up.
In this weather?
In this weather?
Bennings?
Goes on like that quite awhile. What do you gentlemen make of it?
Could be anything... Men in isolation... some beef that snowballed... got out of hand...
Hold on, damn it. We're getting nowhere... If this bit of Blair's about absorbing and imitating is true... then that dog could have gotten to anybody.
And if it got to Clark... Clark could have gotten to anybody.
How long will it take you to prepare this?
A couple of hours.
A couple of hours.
Well, get to it.
Can there be... some kind of test? To find out who's what?
A serum test possibly.
I don't see how... when I'm finished I return it right away.
When was the last time you used it?
When was the last time you used it?
A day or so ago... I guess.
I'm getting worried about you. You ought to have a checkup.
Let's just not get worried about anything just now.
Let's just not get worried about anything just now.
After all this mess then.
After all this mess then.
After all this mess.
Gotta be from the Norwegian camp.
How far's that?
How far's that?
'Bout eighty kilos southwest.
'Bout eighty kilos southwest.
That far?
How many in their party?
Started with six. There'd be four others left.
Right. Why not?
What's that?
Hey, man...!
You reach anybody yet?
You reach anybody yet?
We're a thousand miles from anybody else, man. It's going to get a hell of a lot worse before it gets better.
We're a thousand miles from anybody else, man. It's going to get a hell of a lot worse before it gets better.
Well, stick to it.
Couple seconds of an Argentine disco station.
Well, stick with it. I want you at it round the clock. We got to get help in here...
Put that down!
No.
No.
I'll put this right through your head.
Look, if you're going to keep bitching, MacReady -- Palmer's offered to take him up...
What are you talking?! He's had two months training in those choppers!
We're on fire!
Don't let up, Childs!
Don't let up, Childs!
Extinguishers.
You're not thinking of going after them, are you?
I am going after them.
Get these things out of supply and meet me over by the snowmobiles.
You're not going to catch them in one of those with the start they got.
You're not going to catch them in one of those with the start they got.
Palmer, how long would it take you to strap those big four-cylinder carburetors on?
Ah... no one... I give it to Copper when he needs it...
Could anyone have gotten it from you?
Let's rush him. He's not going to blow us all up.
Damn if I won't.
Pure nonsense. This won't prove a damn thing.
Thought you'd feel that way, Garry. You were the only one who could have gotten to that blood plasma... ... we'll do you last...
Looks good.
One thousand volts. Should be enough.
How long's it been?
Little over two hours.
Four!
What is it out there, anyway? Forty-five knots?
What's...
Blair. He's gone berserk.
Oh, I got you. Not too long.
Then get a move on. Childs, come with me.
How's that Thing get to the dogs? I though we stopped it in time.
Copper thinks they swallowed pieces of it during the fight.
Copper thinks they swallowed pieces of it during the fight.
And that was enough?
No it ain't there. Would I be asking if it were there?
Move it, Palmer.
Sanchez...? Hey, who...
Mac, where the hell is that pump!!
Somebody definitely messed with it.
We going to make it?
We going to make it?
Hope so. Another ten, fifteen minutes. What I don't get is...
Sanchez, you and Palmer search the inside...
I ain't going with Sanchez.
What kind of test?
I'm sure a lot of you already know.
Tie up Clark, too.
He's dead.
He's dead.
Norris looked pretty dead, himself. Bullets don't kill these Things.
How we going to try and find out who's... you know, who's who?
Can you think of any other tests?
Where were the flashlights?
Screw the flashlights. Where the hell were you?
We've got to find Fuchs. When we find him -- we kill him.
Why?
Why?
If he's one of those Things, we've got to get to him before he changes... Nauls, you and Childs and I'll check the outside shacks...
What if it doesn't come?
It'll come. It needs us. We're the only thing left to imitate... Give me a hand.
He might just wait us out.
I'm going to blow the generator when you get back. He'll have to come for us -- or freeze.
That thing's too smart to be hiding any more of its clothes, MacReady.
Just keep looking.
This storm do that?
Couldn't be possible. Must have weighted a ton and a half...
... Hey, somebody! Open up, it's me, MacReady... ... Come on, damn it... The towline snapped. Been crawling around like a seal out here...
Bullshit! He's got to know damn well I cut it!
We're going to draw a little bit of everybody's blood.
What are you going to do? Drink it?
What are you going to do? Drink it?
Watching Norris in there... gave me the idea that maybe every part of you bastards is a whole. Every piece of you is self-sufficient, an animal unto itself. When a man bleeds it's just tissue. But blood from one of you Things won't obey. It's a newly formed individual with a built-in desire to protect its own life. When attacked, your blood will try
What is it?
Everything that's been missing.
Where was he trying to go?
Anyplace but here.
What about Childs?
Forget about Childs. He's over.
You and Nauls got to block off the west side bunks, the mess hall and the kitchen.
You crazy? He might be inside already?
You crazy? He might be inside already?
Chance we got to take. We got to force him to come down the east side to the door we got rigged.
Get back!!
The generator!
The generator!
Screw the generator!!
Got Sanchez... World War Three wouldn't mess with this fucker... Can go through walls... And it's like all over the place...
Calm down and get in your position.
Calm down and get in your position.
Position, my ass...
Maybe it ain't coming.
Then we go after him.
Then we go after him.
Bet the last place you ever go.
You jerking off or just pissed?
We got any more of those electronic chess things down in supply?
We got any more of those electronic chess things down in supply?
Get your gear on.
Get your gear on.
What for?
Magnesium of some type... or some kind of strange alloy. And those poor dumb bastards had to go and blow the hell out of it.
So what do you make of it?
So what do you make of it?
You know damn well what we both make of it.
You know damn well what we both make of it.
No chance it could have been some new kind of test craft?
Somebody else sure as hell thought so.
Who else could have used that key?
We should sleep in shifts.
Right. Half of us awake at all times.
What's happened?!
MacReady, that you?
MacReady, that you?
Yeah!
Yeah!
It's the generator I think! No power.
It's the generator I think! No power.
Well, let's get down there.
... Made sure I got ahead of him on the towline on the way back... cut him loose.
MacReady...?
MacReady...?
He's one of them.
He's one of them.
When do you think it got to him?
You hear that?
Hear what?
It's got into the pub! It's turned on the stereo!
What?!
What?!
It's in between us and them!! How we going to get back?!
It's in between us and them!! How we going to get back?!
Can't hear you.
It must have been hard, leaving your work.
The journey is part of my work.
Now how did you get hurt?
I had an accident.
I had an accident.
I figured that. What kind of accident?
What do you do on the towers?
On the towers?
On the towers?
I'm training to be a high climber.
Ah... no.
Don't tell me you're a mud carrier.
Don't tell me you're a mud carrier.
'Fraid so. Just a regular old... mud carrier.
... Thousands and thousands of people. And sometimes we live in great buildings that reach up five or ten stories.
And everyone looks like us?
And everyone looks like us?
Exactly like you. Well, maybe not as healthy.
She didn't want me to be a climber. She wanted me to be a planner like her.
I'm so sorry, Kalen.
How can they just go back to work as if nothing happened?
What else can they do?
What else can they do?
Kalen... Do you have any idea where they take them?
Kalen... Do you have any idea where they take them?
We're not supposed to think about it. But I dream about it sometimes...
There's a place that might help... we could try going there.
Where?
Where?
The Hall of Books.
The Hall of Books.
You have books?! Kalen, you've got to take me there. There might be history. Records. Something to help us find where the Morlocks took --
You have books?! Kalen, you've got to take me there. There might be history. Records. Something to help us find where the Morlocks took --
I shouldn't have mentioned it. We can't go there.
No one ever comes here. My mother told me stories about it late at night. They tell all the children.
What kind of stories?
What kind of stories?
About the voice in the darkness. About the ghosts...
I had a friend who came here once. Sort of a dare.
What happened?
What happened?
He came back screaming... He never talked about it after that. I don't think he even got this far.
I think we should go on by ourselves.
No...
No...
Please, just listen to me... Your mother would be very cross with me if you got hurt. I'll find her.

But you're only a mud carrier.
But you're only a mud carrier.
I'll be all right... You go back to the village and light the fire. So we can find our way home.
... Well, you wanted to see it.
This is it?
This is it?
Around here.
Yes. Just about here.
But there's nothing here.
Right up your alley, I would think. You are from the past, yes?
How did you know?!
How did you know?!
I can smell carcinogens and industrial pollutants on your skin that have not been known here for -- -- 800,000 years perhaps. Don't keep me in suspense. What year?

I must say, you look remarkably good. You don't want a book then?

I know you -- you're an automaton of some sort that --

An "automaton"?! Please! I'm a biomechanical organism. Well, what's left of one. What's left of all of them, actually. I am the last... ... And "these fragments I have shored against my ruins." T.S. Eliot. You wouldn't know him yet but you'll just love him, he's divine, if a little dour. Very shy though... hiding over here...
Sir... have you a name?
I am called Vox... ... Now you are Eloi.
Please, we need your help. The Morlocks have taken --
Morlocks --
Morlocks --
You know of them?
You know of them?
Who doesn't know the Morlocks?
Who doesn't know the Morlocks?
Do you know where they live?
Do you know where they live?
Oh yes... They found our knowledge useful for a time. They used us much as your people did. Then they decided they had learned enough so they tore us up for spare parts.

But you escaped.

I was lucky. The others weren't.
I was lucky. The others weren't.
How have you survived so long?
Regenerating fission reactor, you wouldn't understand. It's power is well beyond your neanderthal cranial capacity.
Can you show us where they live?
We need your help.
Why should I help you? You primates -- you great, lumbering, hairy animals, drenched in blood from the moment of your hideous conception -- what have you ever used knowledge for but destruction and bloodshed! A little bit of learning and you lay waste to the world! You're no better than the Morlocks!
Because you'll never die.
Excuse me?
Excuse me?
You'll live like this forever. Alone. You were meant to help. To be with people. Not like this.
So, Relic, you want to open Pandora's box, do you? See all the mysteries exposed?
Yes.
Yes.
And if the truth is so horrible that it will haunt your dreams for all time?
And if the truth is so horrible that it will haunt your dreams for all time?
I'm used to that.
When was his mother taken?
Last night.
Last night.
Send him away.
Send him away.
What?
What?
Send him home. You don't want him to see it.
Send him home. You don't want him to see it.
Kalen... hold on a minute.
My God... I saw this.
It frightens you.
It frightens you.
Yes...
Yes...
It was meant to.
So, do we go on?
Yes.
Yes.
Aren't you a plucky little -- ?
Aren't you a plucky little -- ?
Oh, shut up.
It's what they want you to see.
This is the way in?
This is the way in?
Yes... Are you sure you want to do this?
Yes... Are you sure you want to do this?
Yes. But you've done enough. Thank you for your help... I hope someday people read your books again.
In for a penny, in for a pound. Do you know that saying?
Yes... Thank you.
Machines?
Yes.
Yes.
Do you know which way?
Vox?
This way.
What's it all for?
The air... the power.
The air... the power.
Why did they built it?
Why did they built it?
The Morlocks didn't build this.
Alexander... Listen to me, it was wrong to bring you. You're not going to find what you're looking for.
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
Trust me... You don't want to see any more.
They raise them like cattle... Feed them until they're ready and then hunt them.
No...
No...
How are your dreams now?
This has to end.
End...?
End...?
This has to end.
Vox --
Imagine that... seems that little devil got my power relays...
Takes a licking but keeps on ticking... ... For a while anyway.
What can I do? Tell me what to do.
What can I do? Tell me what to do.
Nothing to do, I'm afraid. I'm just a librarian after all. Wasn't exactly made for all this swashbuckling. Very Byronic end, though. I appreciate that. Do you know Byron?

I don't understand.

I'm going to end it, Alexander. As we discussed...
Now get out of my sight, you hideous primate.
I'll never forget this.
I'll never forget this.
I should hope not... ... Alexander... Make them read my books. Tell them who they are. Who they could be.

As slaves.
As slaves.
To work the machines and build the tunnels. You can't imagine what it was like when it all started. We survived for millennia, scraping the lichen and microscopic organisms from the rock with our teeth and digging for water with our nails. Endlessly. For generations. And we... became.
And centuries later when we tried to emerge into the sun again, we couldn't. Our adaptation was too successful. We survived... we endured... for this.
How do you control the Morlocks?
How do you control the Morlocks?
We make them see what we wish.

How?

As our bodies atrophied our minds... compensated.
And what of the Eloi?
They survived above. Became what they are.

No... they didn't survive only to be your food. You did that.
No... they didn't survive only to be your food. You did that.
I'm afraid your indignation is lost here. I have no more "human" response to the Eloi then you would have to a carrot. It's just how we live now.

It can't all be like this...
What?
Go back to where you came from. Or die here.
Go back to where you came from. Or die here.
Why would you let me go back?
Why would you let me go back?
Because the past is immutable. Frozen. Dead... And you are the past.
Say I just come back again?
Alexander, yours is a world of brocade and velvet, not tooth and claw. Why would you come back to this? To save a few cattle? No.

You took her because she helped me.
You took her because she helped me.
Yes. Initiative and daring are not desirable traits in the Eloi. But you should be happy for her. She won't remember the creature she was. She will... become.
She won't remember you. None of them will. You will be forgotten. That is how history works.
A man can change his history.
A man can change his history.
After all you've seen... after man's entire journey... you still believe that?
Now will you go?
No...
If I can only find the right door... the lady or the tiger...
No...
No...
It's always the tiger for you, Alexander, haven't you learned that by now?...
That was a foolish thing to do.
I'm a foolish man.
I could have a hundred Morlocks here in thirty seconds.
I know.
I know.
Does this prove something to you? Have you made some great stand of which I'm unaware?
I'm tired of running.
Oh, you won't be running for long...
But you've earned a reward for your valor. I think you should become. You'll like it here. Once you get used to the darkness.
I don't think that's going to happen.
I don't think that's going to happen.
And why not?
And why not?
Because...
It's spectacular...

What's happening to the moon?!
The 2005 terraforming demolitions for the lunar excavations sent the moon into a diminishing retrograde orbit resulting in global gravitational fluctuations, increased seismic activity and tidal anomalies. Can I tell you more?
No -- wait -- the moon's falling out of orbit -- that's not possible!

I was getting to that... The moon has reached the gravitational Roche Limit, 7,300 miles above the surface of the Earth. This has created pressure on the lunar stratum beyond gravitational tolerances.

Oh dammit, I love you! I can't eat, I can't sleep, I can't think, all I do is moon over you and -- hum, apparently.
And what do you propose, Professor? Shall we hold a seminar to study the problem?
You know, the moment is rather dying here.
Hold on... I know I have it...
I know it's not a diamond but --

All right...
Alex, what is it?
Nothing -- let's just get out of the park.
Alex...?!
Shhh. Let's just hurry on here. We don't have to talk, all right?
Why do we have to race for heaven's sake?!
I want to get into the light, that's all. Please...

Now I know you're ill -- passing up the chance to explore some new gadget.
It's only a machine.

Emma actually likes chalk dust -- says it smells like me.
How romantic...
The most able inventor I know and you can't tie a simple four-in- hand.
That's how I knew we were destined to be together. When I met her parents for the first time I came right from class and I was covered in chalk. They sniffed and snorted, but she just smiled. At that moment -- I just knew. How did you know with Molly?

Oh?
Oh?
She's gotten into your equations.
All these clocks -- how can you constantly be running late?!

I've been working.
I came by the house every day after the funeral. And then every week. Then every other month. Then I stopped coming. Did you even notice?

It hurt me, Alex. Very much.

Then why are you here?
It's my Jamie's birthday today. Your godson. He's nine years old. At his party he asked me if Uncle Alex was coming. I told him no. Then he asked me if you didn't like him anymore.
For God's Sake, David --

I live with it every minute of every day.

I know that --
I know that --
You don't know that. You couldn't possibly. If I'd only done this, or that, if I'd arrived ten minutes earlier, or later. If we'd taken a different path or I hadn't fought the man for the ring. You have no idea what it is to relive every moment of that night -- consider every action you made -- and every one of them wrong.

Wasn't it?... I have a dream almost every night now. The Lady and the Tiger, you remember that story? In the dream I'm alone in a huge chamber with a thousand doors. Behind every door, save one, is a tiger. I have to make the decision. Which door conceals Emma? And I just stand there... looking at the doors...

You won't say that in a week.
I pray to God that in a week you're not here.
All right. I'll come for dinner. And in the meantime... you'll think about what we discussed?
In a week... we will never have had this conversation.
Good night, David.
Good night, Alex.
And this would be my study. There was an elm tree outside the window then.
I'm glad.
This... was my home.
His home.
Couldn't help but overhearing. Two fine young people starting out on the road of life. I wish you the very best.
Thank you...
Thank you...
I hope it's a happy journey for you both -- and much as I hate to do this, moved as I am by your protestations of love, I'll be needing your money now.

And your jewelry too. I guess we could consider this your first little bump on the road to married bliss.
I don't understand.
Did you hear me, lad?
All right, all right -- here -- everything --
You're up! You must be feeling better --
Yes...
How long did you travel?
Well it seems like a long time -- but it wasn't really. It's rather hard to explain.
Yes.
Thank you.
Is there a lot of illness?
Some. But I mean we aren't all so... handsome.
His curiosity is amazing.
Mm.
Kalen will tire you out if you let him. He's always been curious. His father was firm with him but... it's just his way.
Your husband is dead?
Your husband is dead?
He's gone to a better place.
It's hard for me to imagine a better place. Where I come from there's so much... frenzy. Day and night. It seems we're all running faster and faster... ... All in identical bowler hats.
You're not from beyond the valley.
You're not from beyond the valley.
What makes you say that?
We don't have anything like this. Or the machine where Kalen found you. And I doubt they do beyond the valley... Now where do you come from?

How long ago?

More than 800,000 years.
Why?
Why not?
Why not?
Why would you do that?

Yes. Or forward into the future. I suppose I really should check on the machine, see that it hasn't been damaged...

I'll take you tomorrow... You must have seen a lot on your journey.

For a time it was astounding. I saw the years spinning by, I was in the years spinning by. We made such advances. I don't understand half of them. There was a machine that talked to me and others that flew through the sky... We must have been incredible thinkers and artists --
Is he all right?
Just a dream. You should sleep too. You're still not well.
I'm going to sit with Kalen. Keep the fire burning if you can.
I will...
I'll take you to your machine tomorrow.
Thank you...
You seem fascinated by the stars.
You can see so many here.

Don't then have stars where you come from?

You share dreams? That's incredible.

You liked it there.

Oh, very much... ... I used to work somewhere in that direction, I think. A huge university where we taught everything from botany to history to literature.

Those rocks, over there... they're the same... this is... Central Park.
You know this?
You know this?
Over there was Fifth Avenue -- and the Plaza Hotel was there... this is... the carriage path. We're on the carriage path.
This is where my journey started... right here.
You lost someone.

You've welcomed me into your home. Into your lives. Everyone has... For the first time in a long time it doesn't hurt quite so much. I thank you for that.
I know what it is to lose someone. When my husband was taken from us... I thought the pain would never end.
Good -- it looks fine. We had quite a ride together...

Alexander, take my son away. Take him back to your time. Will you do that?
Mara --

Please, I beg you. Take him away from here --
Kalen...
Mara...?
Mara...?
No!
Mara -- what -- ?!
Kalen -- we have to get Kalen -- !
It was different then.
My laboratory was about... here. And the kitchen was over there, where that tree is. Mrs. Watchit wouldn't allow me in much... but, yes, this is about the kitchen.
Oh huzzah, the master's home.
Do you have it?!
Do you have it?!
Hello, Mr. Philby.
Don't torture me -- do you have it?
I have it, but don't you think for one moment I'll be letting you go out in that filthy coat -- now go upstairs and change. I've laid out your green coat.
I have it, but don't you think for one moment I'll be letting you go out in that filthy coat -- now go upstairs and change. I've laid out your green coat.
What's the matter with -- ? -- What would I do without you, Mrs. Watchit?
Now that's more like it. You look a proper gentlemen for once.
Then if Emma turns me down will you marry me?

Oh, I'm already swooning.

Ouch -- all right, wish me luck.
Sir, Mr. Philby is here.
Here?

Yes, sir, he --
Yes, sir, he --
Tell him to go away --
All right, Mrs. Watchit. You can go.
May I get you some --

That'll be all.
Dr. Philby, Dr. Hartdegen. I received the most extraordinary letter last week. From a parent. We are always pleased to receive letters from parents. They are our employers, after all. This gentleman's son is in your class, Dr. Hartdegen.
I see.
I see.
As I recall the syllabus the name of your tutorial is "Applied Mathematics and Engineering", am I correct?
As I recall the syllabus the name of your tutorial is "Applied Mathematics and Engineering", am I correct?
Exactly correct, sir.
Well, just as I thought. Surely it's all been a terrible mistake. This parent actually suggested that your freshman course in applied mathematics has somehow become a seminar on theoretical physics!
Imagine that.
Imagine that.
But I know that none of my faculty would ever deviate from the assigned curriculum.

Well... perhaps I have "deviated" the tiniest bit.
Well... perhaps I have "deviated" the tiniest bit.
Might I ask why?
Might I ask why?
Because the assigned curriculum is boring.
Sir, that curriculum is forty years out of date. The students today are looking toward the new century -- they want to be challenged and inspired, not spoon-fed dusty old equations that have been proved a thousand times. They want to explore.
Do they?
And roosters.
No, Dr. Hartdegen, they are not just chickens and roosters. They are science. Perhaps they aren't "inspiring" to you. Perhaps they don't "challenge" you --
No, Dr. Hartdegen, they are not just chickens and roosters. They are science. Perhaps they aren't "inspiring" to you. Perhaps they don't "challenge" you --
No, sir --
No, sir --
Animal husbandry is science, Dr. Hartdegen. I have been breeding these fowl for fourteen years. I have filled a library with information on their feeding patterns, social behavior and breeding. Empirical, exacting, quantifiable records.

Sir --
With respect, sir, would we have the telegraph without fantasy? Would we have radium and X-rays without someone first dreaming we could?
The advances you speak of were the result of countless years of study and empirical experimentation, a careful evolutionary process, not chalkboard parlor-tricks.

Abstract mathematics, relativity of dimensions, geometrical "durations" -- even allowing for the uses of speculation, what is the point?
Because it's a new way of seeing the world! Of seeing our place in it!
Yes, sir.
Very good. Now if you will excuse us for a moment.
And hungry, I'd say. You had such a long journey.
I did...
I did...
Well, we're happy you're here. Come inside.
"Eloi"?
What are your people called?

Well, I guess you'd call us... New Yorkers.

New Yorkers.
We had another visitor from beyond the valley about four years ago. His name was Moren. Do you know him?
No...
No...
He said he traveled for two months.
He said he traveled for two months.
I took a different route.
Oh, very different. But not entirely... I mean we have lots of, um, trees and such. But not everywhere. And more roads. And buildings.
Why?
Why?
To live in. There's a lot of us... beyond the valley.
To live in. There's a lot of us... beyond the valley.
New Yorkers.
New Yorkers.
Yes. I hope you won't take this the wrong way but is there someone older I could talk to? An elder or patriarch of some kind?
I am the oldest.
No, I mean someone considerably older. Your father perhaps?
No, I mean someone considerably older. Your father perhaps?
My father has gone to a better place.

I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...
Of course. You're just tired. Mara, will you look after Alexander tonight?
Good morning, Alexander. Feeling up to some work?
I suppose so.
Where do they take them?!
We don't know.
We don't know.
We have to go after them, find where -- !

Alexander, I know you're trying to help. But they don't come back.

What do you mean?!

They've gone to a better place.

You know that's not true.
You know that's not true.
We choose to believe it.
We choose to believe it.
My God! How can you just do nothing!? They're your friends, your family. You all knew Mara. You ate with her and worked with her... Your work in the valley, what is that for if not to --
This is out life, Alexander. It's a hard life but it is how we have always lived.
Then it's time to change that --
Then it's time to change that --
We are what we are.
You won't even try?
We can't change the day and the night, Alexander. This is the world.
My fowl have polluted the yard.
Dean Fulton...
Sir, if I may --
Young man, we have a way of doing things here. Radical theorizing is not acceptable. Have I made myself understood?
If I might explain, sir --
You supported his application, Dr. Philby. You are his senior, advisor. I depend upon you to restrain his... excesses. Any repetition of the behavior I witnessed in his classroom today and there will be consequences for you both.

Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Now you are upsetting my fowl. Please go.
How did you get hurt?
Kalen...
Kalen...
I found you. I saved your life. You were bleeding all over the place!
I found you. I saved your life. You were bleeding all over the place!
That's quite enough, Kalen.
What did you do at night?
What's it like where you come from?
We'll see about that.
I am. Are you a climber?
I want to see your home. Will you take me?
Kalen, right now you need to go up to bed. You're exhausting Alexander.
Kalen, right now you need to go up to bed. You're exhausting Alexander.
You'll tell me more tomorrow?
Kalen, it's all right, I'm here --
They're here! They're inside the house -- !
They're here! They're inside the house -- !
No, you're safe --
No, you're safe --
They're inside --
They're inside --
Kalen, look at me. There's no one here but us. You see... I'm here, you're here, Alexander's here. There are no Morlocks. It was just a dream...
Hello, Mrs. Watchit. You're looking in the pink.
Must be all the exercise I get scampering up and down these stairs like a wee lamb.
I wonder if that poor girl has any idea what she's in for?
For our sake, I hope not.
I don't know what to tell you, sir. He's been gone this whole week.
And you've no idea where he went?
And you've no idea where he went?
No, sir.
Sir?
I'm glad he's gone. Maybe he's finally found a place where he can be happy.
I think I might be. But there'll be some changes made. I run a tight house.
I have no doubt of that. I'll come by in the morning and we'll arrange it. Goodnight, Mrs. Watchit.
I have no doubt of that. I'll come by in the morning and we'll arrange it. Goodnight, Mrs. Watchit.
Goodnight, Mr. Philby.
You ok?
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
[Beat] Listen, I hate to bother you...

Then don't.

But... what about Starks?

Should we be...
Should we be...
Should we be what? Trying to change him any way we can? [Beat] Yes.
Should we be what? Trying to change him any way we can? [Beat] Yes.
But the Jacket? I mean...should we be leaving him in like that?
Don't get all worked up, Justin. I expected some common sense on your part and clearly I was expecting too much. [Beat] Just open the drawer.
We never should have done this to him...
We never should have done this to him...
Well, what are we gonna do about it now?
Well, your condition's pretty serious.
[Beat] So they say. [Off Becker's steady gaze] What?
[Beat] So they say. [Off Becker's steady gaze] What?
I'm just looking at you. Does that make you uncomfortable?
I'm just looking at you. Does that make you uncomfortable?
Depends on what you're seeing.
You said you couldn't remember killing Officer Harrison. Correct?
[Beat] You don't believe me, do you?
[Beat] You don't believe me, do you?
It's not my job to believe you.
He's recovering on the third floor.
Are you kidding me? He's not psychotic!
Are you kidding me? He's not psychotic!
Then how would you describe him, Beth? Merely rebellious?
I don't know better. All I know is that you left me in there.
In where?
In where?
[Uncertainly] In that thing...the Jacket.
We were forced to use restrains if that's what you're referring to.
That wasn't a fucking restraint.
That wasn't a fucking restraint.
Actually, that's exactly what our equipment is.
Relax.
Don't act like I don't know what's real. [Beat] I'm not the one that's crazy here.
Don't act like I don't know what's real. [Beat] I'm not the one that's crazy here.
[Pointedly] Of course you're not.
You're just suffering from delusions that are unfortunately part of your condition.
Don't give me that. I know what's real, goddamnit! You strapped me in something and stuck me in a drawer.
I didn't dream it. I may have been asleep but it wasn't a dream. BECKER sits down in a CHAIR, half-shrouded in the light.
I had a patient a few years ago. His name was Ted Casey...
I had a patient a few years ago. His name was Ted Casey...
I don't give a shit about your patient!
I don't give a shit about your patient!
I wasn't pausing to see if you did. [Beat] But, incidentally, you should, because you're birds of a feather.
We are not birds of a feather.
Maybe not. [Beat] But I do think you're in a tree... woofing like a dog. And I'm just trying to help you the only way I can think of.
Long live the Organization for the Organized!
Sit down, Mr. Starks! Sit down, Mr. Starks!
Hello, William. I understand you've been asking for me almost every hour. I would've been here sooner but you gave our little state visitor quite a bit to talk to me about.
That's too bad.
That's too bad.
It is. But when it comes down to it, you just have to patient with them. They'd rather have their vacation, too, so they just push dealing with our "practices" off to the New Year.

They make it hard for you to get away with your business, huh?
They make it hard for you to get away with your business, huh?
Temporarily.
And what's that?
My business?
My business?
Yes.
Yes.
Getting away with things. Like whatever I may or may not have gotten away with Officer Harrison.
Getting away with things. Like whatever I may or may not have gotten away with Officer Harrison.
You killed him?
I'll say a prayer for you in Church today, Starks. Maybe the Gods can pick up where the medicine left off.
You sure you know where to find one?
You sure you know where to find one?
I've managed to every Sunday of my life. [Beat] Some of us are God- fearing men, Starks.
I've managed to every Sunday of my life. [Beat] Some of us are God- fearing men, Starks.
And what does that mean?
And what does that mean?
Means we believe in doing his work and fear what the world would be like if we didn't at least try to.
Becker, how do you sleep at night?
You in here. [Beat] Works like a drug.
Who are you?
I think you know. Your eyes say you do.
I think you know. Your eyes say you do.
[Beat] You're his son?
[Beat] You're his son?
No. I'm not his son. I'm him. [Beat] What? You look like you've seen a ghost. You can come here and touch me, old man. I'm the real thing.
No. I'm not his son. I'm him. [Beat] What? You look like you've seen a ghost. You can come here and touch me, old man. I'm the real thing.
How...how are you here?
You died, Starks. Years ago, in the hospital.
I know. [Beat] You killed me, didn't you?
I know. [Beat] You killed me, didn't you?
No. I didn't. I swear I didn't. I probably helped push you to kill yourself, but I didn't do it.
No. I didn't. I swear I didn't. I probably helped push you to kill yourself, but I didn't do it.
I didn't kill myself. I died from a blow to the head. How'd it happen? I have to know.
I don't know how you died. The last time I put you in the Jacket was just after you told me you remembered killing that police officer...
I didn't say I remembered killing him. I just repeated some words to get myself back in there.
I didn't say I remembered killing him. I just repeated some words to get myself back in there.
I know. [Beat] I knew that when you came out.
I know. [Beat] I knew that when you came out.
How?
How?
Because...because you came out and said something you couldn't have possibly have known. You came back and repeated three names...
Of people like you. People I was just trying to help. They couldn't get worse so I thought, with medication, they might get...
Medication? What kind of meds do you chase with nights in a cadaver drawer?

The three of you weren't regular patients. You were criminals that ended up at Alpine Grove.
The three of you weren't regular patients. You were criminals that ended up at Alpine Grove.
No, we were patients.
How did you come to know their names?
You just told me. The last time I was with you was when I was in the Jacket. I'm in it right now, Dr. Becker.
You just told me. The last time I was with you was when I was in the Jacket. I'm in it right now, Dr. Becker.
I don't understand...
I don't understand...
I'm in it as we speak. [Beat] You're haunting yourself right now. [Beat] I guess sometimes we indict ourselves if no one else does. You didn't make history like you wanted to, huh, Dr. Becker. It turned out different, didn't it?

I didn't put you in Alpine Grove.
I didn't put you in Alpine Grove.
No. [Beat] You put me on drugs and then you put me in the Jacket.
Do I know you from somewhere?
You may have known my father, William Starks.
That's right! Goddamn, you're the spitting image. I didn't know he had a son.
He didn't either.
Did you know my father?
Oh yeah, sure. He killed a cop, right?
My father used to talk about you.
Oh yeah, what'd he say?
Look here, I don't like you getting in my face and saying this bullshit to me...
That's too bad.
That's too bad.
I thought you said you never knew your father.
I thought you said you never knew your father.
I didn't. [Beat] Did you have anything to do with his death?
I didn't. [Beat] Did you have anything to do with his death?
I don't know what you're talking about, man. I swear. This is some weird shit you're telling me... and I don't know how come you're doing it.
He died because he bled to death from a blow to his head. Someone had to have given him it.
I never touched your father! I swear!
We're late.
I wish they'd skip the formality of this annual review and just cut our budget. Our silence on the matter should be enough to appease the civic conscience without wasting an hour we don't have.
I wish they'd skip the formality of this annual review and just cut our budget. Our silence on the matter should be enough to appease the civic conscience without wasting an hour we don't have.
Maybe it's not such a waste.
It's the ticking of a box on a sheet of paper no one cares about.
They don't care about all the things we do right. [Beat] But they might ...they might care about what we're doing wrong. [Beat] That's what they should come here to look for.
What should they be looking for?
They should just be looking harder.
Where? [Beat] It's Becker isn't it? He's doing stuff, isn't he?
Later. I'll tell you about it later. We got a session to catch now.
You look like you've lost some weight. Are you eating?
I am. One of the few things I remember doing is eating. So I guess I must be exercising it off in my dreams.
You done with your small talk?
Sure.
Sure.
Good.
This is really happening, isn't it?
[Beat] What do you need me to do?
[Beat] What do you need me to do?
[Beat] Thank you.
I need to get this letter to someone.
I can't take you out of here in your condition...
I can't take you out of here in your condition...
And I can't stay here in my condition. I am going to die tonight. It's already been decided.
And I can't stay here in my condition. I am going to die tonight. It's already been decided.
No, it hasn't.
No, it hasn't.
Yes. [Beat] It has. Everything up 'till today is done. Everything starting with tomorrow is up for grabs.
I'm sorry I can't tell you more about your father's death, Mr. Starks. Our own medical examiners determined only that he died from a blunt trauma to the head but that was right around the time the Alpine Grove's staff changed and I'm afraid we didn't have the best record system before then.
His body was found on January 1, 1993, but do you know if that was long after he had died?
His body was found on January 1, 1993, but do you know if that was long after he had died?
No, I don't. I'm sorry. I wish I knew more.
No, I don't. I'm sorry. I wish I knew more.
What about Dr. Thomas Becker or Dr. Loel Lorenson? There was also a Dr. Gries, I think.
What about Dr. Thomas Becker or Dr. Loel Lorenson? There was also a Dr. Gries, I think.
Well, Dr. Lorenson is still here at the hospital. If she was here at the time your father was, then I'm sure she'd be of more help to you.

What about Dr. Becker and Mr. Gries?
Unfortunately, I'm not familiar with Dr. Becker and Dr. Gries passed away three, four years ago.
Get your fucking hands off my daughter!
Mom, he just fixed our car.
Mom, he just fixed our car.
Jackie, get in the car. NOW!
I'm sorry? Your face looks awfully familiar, I just can't quite place it...
Mom, this is the guy that drove us home that afternoon we were stuck on the highway. The guy you yelled at for no good reason...
Mom, this is the guy that drove us home that afternoon we were stuck on the highway. The guy you yelled at for no good reason...
Oh, yeah.
Jackie, go play in the snow.
Why?
Why?
Just do it.
Come on, mom. Don't fall asleep...
You two ok?
You two ok?
Our car won't start.
Your mom take anything before this happened?
Yeah, but I don't know what.
Yeah, but I don't know what.
[Beat] What's your name?
[Beat] What's your name?
Jackie.
But I like it I guess.
Hey, can you reach the gas pedal?
Hey, can you reach the gas pedal?
Yeah.
You're just gonna walk?
Yeah, I'll hitch a ride or something. [Beat] Let her throw it all up before she gets back behind the wheel.
What're those?
Dog tags. [Off her blank look] They've got your name and date of birth for identification.
Dog tags. [Off her blank look] They've got your name and date of birth for identification.
What for?
What for?
[Beat] In case you get lost, or can't remember who you are.
I think I can remember what's on them.
William Starks. [Beat] Thanks.
What'd you do? Snoop all over the place? You had no right. You had no right to go through anything.
[Beat] I know it doesn't make sense. It doesn't even make sense to me.
[Beat] I know it doesn't make sense. It doesn't even make sense to me.
If you don't get out of my house right now, I'll call the police.
Jackie, I'm William Starks. I can prove it.
What? Now you're gonna show me some kind of driver's license?
What? Now you're gonna show me some kind of driver's license?
No, I don't have anything to show you. I'm here from a mental hospital.
No, I don't have anything to show you. I'm here from a mental hospital.
Well, you belong in one.
Stop it! Stop it! JACKIE covers her ears and looks at him, pleading with her eyes. STARKS' eyes plead right back.
I'm sorry for upsetting you, [beat] but I'm not lying to you.
I'm sorry for upsetting you, [beat] but I'm not lying to you.
You can't be William Starks. He's dead.

William Starks is dead... [Beat] I've been to his grave.

His body was found New Year's Day, 19...1993. At Alpine...
I looked it up.
How?
I gave you my dog tags.
No, you didn't. They found William Starks' body dead in the snow.

How'd he die?
How'd he die?
I don't know. But he did die. STARKS falters under the news. JACKIE looks around, through her now blurred eyes, like she might find some help in the apartment. She settles for the BOTTLE of VODKA on the table, lowers the iron fork and takes a long heavy drink, then laughs nervously as she looks up.

I know what this is...I picked you up when I was drunk and you probably thought I'm just fucked up enough to fall for this. But the thing is I know what I'm doing when I drink. I just usually don't care. Right now, I do though. And I want you out. Now.
