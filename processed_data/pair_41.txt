No. Do you? Can't be too hard, can it? I don't think we should be here out in the open like this.
How did those... ?
You're part of it...

No! You're one of them. Of course, it makes perfect sense!
No, it doesn't! Those keys were put there. I didn't even know...

You know... how'd you manage the gun? I mean...
Baby, they were all over the house with metal detectors. They switched your gun with a look-alike, rigged barrel, loaded with blanks. Pop-gun.

No money, no identification or passport. You are in a fix. What did happen to you?
Well, where to begin. It's complicated...
Well, where to begin. It's complicated...
It always is.
What happened was, I'm on vacation, alone... I was robbed, at gunpoint. They hit me and ran. Two men, a few blocks away. They took my wallet, money... all of it. So...
Robbed?
Robbed?
Yes.
Yes.
Have you gone to the police?
Have you gone to the police?
I don't speak Spanish. All I need is to get back... just enough for that.
We'll help with the police, if you want to bother. As far as money goes... can I make a suggestion? You say you were mugged?
Yes.
Yes.
And, they didn't take that watch?
How much is it? A few thousand, at least. A Rolex like that... lucky for you they missed it.
Yes, very lucky.
I need your car, Elizabeth.
What happened to you, Nick? I mean, look at yourself...

Of course you can have it if you need it. Can I get you something to eat?
The last few days, um... I've been thinking... had a lot of spare time. I want to tell you... I'm starting to understand why you left me. I've been resenting you for it, maybe, but ... I want to apologize, for all of it. For shutting you out, for not being there. I... Anyway, I hope you can forgive me.
There's nothing to forgive.

It would mean a lot to me... if you and I could be friends. If I could have you back in my life... in some small way. It would be important.

I'll explain someday.
I hope.
We have to head out... just wanted to say goodbye.
You're going? Well, thanks again. Good to see you, Rachel... Thanks for coming, Mel. I'll get your car back. Right now it's, uh... at the zoo. Sorry.

First, admit to yourself that it sounds intriguing. Second, you don't have to decide today. Take the silly tests, fill out the forms. One day, the game begins. You either love it or hate it.

What makes you ask?
I'm not sure.
All the time I've known you, you've never once asked about him.
He came to my mind recently, that's all.
Your mother thought he was a good man. He worked very hard. What I remember most was his manner was so... slight. It was easy to spend time in a room, and not realize he'd been there the whole time.
Was he morose, or...? I mean...

I only saw Theo drive up.
Who's Watts?
The children. The children Hugh Crain built the house for. The children he never had.
Come on. These are the typically sentimental gestures of a depraved industrialist.
Couldn't get the last ones. You?
I did okay.
Welcome Home Eleanor. Welcome Home? I've never been here. Who did this?
It's somebody's idea of a joke.
Modelling small-group dynamics in the formation of narrative hallucinations. You brought us here to scare us. Insomnia, that was just a decoy issue. You're disgusting.
Is this true? I've been hypnotized?
And this is my assistant, Mary Lambretta.
Greetings.
So why did you need the Addam's Family mansion for a scientific test?
I thought it best to be isolated, to be in a location with a definite sense of history, and I wanted to make sure that it wasn't so pleasant you'd all sleep too easily. You'll be taking a variety of tests, none of them harmful, and you've got the house, the grounds, and each other to keep you company.
That could have been worse.
Yeah.
Luke, can I talk to you?
Sure.
Sure.
Because... well, I know I can trust you.
Because... well, I know I can trust you.
Why?
Why?
I've read your tests.
Do you need me anymore? Cause I'm going to bed. They can stay up talking another 45 minutes if they want, but I gotta try to get some sleep.
Go ahead.
And those are Luke's and mine.
There's a carriage house around back.
I gave my key to the gate to Todd, but the Dudleys'll be here in the morning.
Do we still get paid for the week?

It's not going to hold your weight.
Just stay there, Nell!
You're not telling us something.
Watts. Those were his keys Nell found. His roommate called and said Watts left when he was supposed to. I think he's here.
The rest of you may hate your insomnia, but I find it the best time of the day for me. I'm alone. Nobody's talking to me but myself. My mind is racing with ideas, and I can think.
Nah, you're going crazy with doubt, all of your mistakes are coming back up the pipes, and it's worse than a nightmare. --
He said that Hugh Crain... Hugh Crain was a monster. He said that he was a brutal, horrible man. He told me that Crain drove his workers to early deaths. Crain had children chained to the looms in his mill. And listen to this: his beautiful Rene killed herself.
And why didn't Marrow tell <u>us</u>? Doesn't he trust women? That fuck.
Hey! I heard screaming...
Luke.
Well, this lot is full!
He must have left. Didn't like the looks of the place or something.
I didn't do it.
You could have.
You could have.
So could you! Is this some fucked up idea of art, putting someone else's name to a painting?
So could you! Is this some fucked up idea of art, putting someone else's name to a painting?

Mister very talky, would you please say what it is about this study that bothers you?
The whole thing feels like experimental misdirection. Like he says it's about one thing, a psychological profile of environmental effects on insomnia... and that'd be a legitimate study, but I think that we've been subjected to an academic bait and switch; he's really looking at something else.
We're fucked. We're in a haunted house and we can't get out until the morning.
You don't really believe it's haunted... Do you believe in ghosts?
You don't really believe it's haunted... Do you believe in ghosts?
That depends on your definition of ghosts. I'm going to check on her, and then I'm going to stay awake.

You used the wrong test.
Will the two of you shut up! God damn it! Maybe the tests were right, Marrow. She's sensitive, she's vulnerable, but I don't think she's suicidal and I didn't have to test her. Maybe she wasn't trying to kill herself. Maybe she was really scared. Maybe she really heard voices.
Nell --
-- how much is this car worth?
Was sure she'd be in here.
Where in the hell can she be.

We can't stay here looking for her. She doesn't want to be found...

Come on Malcolm, it's only seven ohms, it's nothing, it's like a joy buzzer! And it's not about the pain, it's about the interference with concentration...
Malcolm, this is essential work I'm doing. Just think what my research can do for education. Elementary school classrooms near train tracks or airports, where loud noise is random; this helps to prove the need for sound insulation if the children are ever going to learn to read.
And that will be a good place to end this study.

Yes, because someone was always keeping me awake. Ever since I was little. That was my job. I took care of my mother and I had to be there for her all night long, and she woke up all the time. And after she died, well, it's been a few months, but I still, I still wake up, it's... a habit. I know we've

How do you feel about Luke's suggestion that it was just the old plumbing? Water hammer, something like that?
Sorry.

That smell... oh, God.
What did it smell like?
It was very specific.

No you're not. Something moved you. You saw something.
Are you coming to confess?
I wish I were. I wish I had done it, then I could confess and you'd be at peace. That great moral philosopher Frank Sinatra once said to someone he loved, I wish you had an enemy, so I could beat him up.
Let's say it wasn't you. Who did it?
I don't know.
I don't know.
It was a stupid thing to do.
It was a stupid thing to do.
It was.
It was.
Welcome Home.
Welcome Home.
You'll never see it again. Mr. Dudley's taking care of it. I'm sorry, Nell. Can I show you something you'd like to see?
You'll never see it again. Mr. Dudley's taking care of it. I'm sorry, Nell. Can I show you something you'd like to see?
Sure.
Someone is playing with you.
Why?
Why?
I don't know.
I don't know.
It doesn't matter. Even if they're tormenting me, someone wants me. What I do with this is up to me. I can be a victim, or I can be a volunteer. And I want to be the volunteer.
What is that tune?
I don't know. A lullaby I guess. My mother used to hum it to me. And her mother before that, and so on. Hugh Crain, would you care to dance?
Nell... please, Nell... take a deep breath...
And they're all locked together in here... and he won't let go of them!
I hadn't done a study of how group fear affects individual performance. Mass hysteria is like a story, Nell. A communal story. Someone starts it. Then we all add a little more to it. And then for some reason -- no one knows how -- we start believing it. This story shapes what we see and hear. We interpret everything through it, make it
It's not real? Crain? He's not real?
Why would we want to do that, Nell?
Because that's where he burned them up, the child laborers from his mills! Because that's where their bones are! He killed <i>hundreds</i>. He took them here and he killed them. Their bones are in the fireplace!
The children want me. They're calling me. They need me.
Nell. You will come here now.
But you told me to look in the paper! You told me I'd be perfect!
Nell, the first time I ever spoke with you in person was the night we met here.
Nell, the first time I ever spoke with you in person was the night we met here.
Then who called me?
No.
My mother used to hum this to me. Like her mother hummed it to her. And my great grandmother Carolyn hummed it to her.
Come on.
No --
What'll happen to us, Nell?
Nothing, if you leave right now. There's a war going on all around us. Don't get in the way, please.
You know what he's really upset about?
What?
What?
You're going to publish, he's going to perish... And why did you hire me for this?
You hear the vibrations in the wire. There's a magnetic pulse in the wires, you feel it. I could test it.
Test it.
Yes, this is Doctor Marrow.
How'd I know it was for you?
How'd I know it was for you?
Because it's my phone. Yes... Mrs. Dudley, just leave the boxes inside, thank you. See you soon. Thank you.
Here's how they're organized. Groups of five, very different personalities: scored all over the Kiersey Temperament Sorter just like you asked for. And they all score high on the insomnia charts.
Good.
What's this? What's this... this picture?
That? That's Hill House.
That? That's Hill House.
This is where we're going?
This is where we're going?
Yes. It's perfect, isn't it?
What happened?
There were no children. Rene died, and <u>then</u> Hugh Crain built all of this, and then he died. His heart was broken.
Have either of you seen David Watts?
No, but Nell's been here longer than I have.
When do we take the tests?
Every day. Basically we'll be hanging out together like we have so far this evening.
Well this is a cozy breakfast.
Good morning, Theo. Luke.
Maybe they're Mary's.
Mary came with me.
Get a blanket!
It's okay... we're all here...
Your fear of him was real. That's all the ghost anyone needs.
How could you do this to people?
Is she asleep?
Yes. But I promised I wouldn't let her alone the whole night.
She needs help.
I'll take her with me to the University tomorrow. I can't believe I read the test wrong. I didn't see anything that looked like she was suicidal.
He's wandering around the house, and Nell heard him. She thought it was ghosts. Let's go look for him again.
No. If he's lost somewhere in the house... he'll have to stay lost until tomorrow, until the night is over. What we have to do now is be together, with Nell.
Oh God, we can't get out!
Nell, what do we do?
I'm not going back to New York City. I'm going to find an apartment with a little flower garden, where you can just see the ocean and at night, when the wind comes in just right, you can hear the sound of the harbor. What about you?
I'm a scientist. I just conducted an experiment. Now I have to write it up.
I'm a scientist. I just conducted an experiment. Now I have to write it up.
But the experiment was a failure.
What do you want?
Oh! You scared me.
Oh! You scared me.
Me? No. What are you doing here?
Me? No. What are you doing here?
Are you Mister Dudley, the caretaker?
Are you Mister Dudley, the caretaker?
Yeah, I'm Mister Dudley, the caretaker. What are you doing here?
Yeah, I'm Mister Dudley, the caretaker. What are you doing here?
I'm with Dr. Marrow's group. I'm supposed to check in with Mrs. Dudley up at the house. Is she here?
Why do you need a chain like that?
That's a good question. What is it about fences? Sometimes a locked chain makes people on both sides of the fence just a little more comfortable. Why would that be?
Is there something about the house?
Mrs. Dudley'll be waiting for you.
That's where she hanged herself.
Who?
Who?
Rene Crain. Up there. Rope. Ship's hawser. Hard to tie. Don't know how she got it.
Why?
Why'd she kill herself?
Why'd she kill herself?
Yes.
Yes.
She was unhappy.
She was unhappy.
Why?
Why?
Can't say. Haven't been here that long. Well, it's Labor Day, gotta get to work.
It's make the soup or answer the door. Can't do both.
Mrs. Dudley.
Mrs. Dudley.
So far.
They're so beautiful. Aren't they?
I've seen 'em. Lot to dust.
I've seen 'em. Lot to dust.
Well, I've never lived with beauty. You must love working here.
It's a job. I keep banker's hours. I set dinner on the dining room sideboard at six. You can serve yourselves. Breakfast is ready at nine. I don't wait on people. I don't stay after dinner. Not after it begins to get dark. I leave before dark comes. We live in town. Nine miles. So there won't be anyone around if you need help.
Why would we --
Why would we --
-- no one could. No one lives any nearer than town. No one will come any nearer than that. In the night. In the dark.
No one could. No one lives any nearer than town.
No one will come any nearer than that.
And what you're wearing, that's great, too.
This? It's from a thrift shop.
This? It's from a thrift shop.
What did it cost?

Fifteen dollars.
Fifteen dollars.
That'd be seventy in New York. You stole it!

It's all I could afford.

Wait. You're not wearing that ironically? This is really you?
Wait. You're not wearing that ironically? This is really you?
I don't know what you mean.
Don't worry, I probably won't be in here much. Light sleeper.
That's why we're here.
That's why we're here.
What do you do?
What do you do?
I'm between jobs right now. My last job... it... the person I was working for... the job ended. Over. So... And you?

Not really.

Ohh, sure, you have trouble with commitment.
Ohh, sure, you have trouble with commitment.
My boyfriend thinks so, my girlfriend doesn't. If we could all live together... but... they hate each other. It's hard to be Miss Perversity when you're the only one at the party. D'you know what I mean?

No.
No.
A blank canvas! I could paint your portrait, directly on you. Or maybe not. So, you? Husbands? Boyfriends? Girlfriends? Where do you live?
A blank canvas! I could paint your portrait, directly on you. Or maybe not. So, you? Husbands? Boyfriends? Girlfriends? Where do you live?
I don't have anyone. But I do have a little apartment of my own. It has a little flower garden. You can just see the ocean. At night, when the wind comes in just right, you can hear the buoys in the harbor.
Jeez.
I know.
I love this house. I really love this house.
You're okay.
A monster? But he built this for the woman he loved, like the Taj Mahal.
The Taj Mahal wasn't a palace, it was a tomb. Why didn't he tell us?
You've been out of the world for a long time, haven't you?
Yes. I've missed it.
Yes. I've missed it.
No. The world has missed you.
Good night, Theo.
You, too. Happy tossing and turning.
If this was some sort of joke, I'm going to kill him.
You know it wasn't a joke, Theo.
Yes. I feel realy rested, too. Theo?
I guess. Oh, your hair! It looks good.
How could he have left without his keys?
Two sets. I don't know. Maybe they're not even his.
Watts?
What's his first name?
What's his first name?
David.
David.
David? David Watts? Can you hear us? David! Daviiiiid!
David?
Maybe he never came in. If he'd come in, he would have left his bags at the door, right? Or maybe he got here early, and went for a walk, and fell. Maybe he's outside.
Is it over?
No, it's getting worse.
Theo... Did you?
Maybe you did it yourself.
Maybe you did it yourself.
Why?
Why?
I don't know. You've been alone for a long time, maybe you want attention. Maybe he did it...
That's so sad.
There's hundreds of them. This must be a record of the children who died at the mills, like Luke said.
There's hundreds of them. This must be a record of the children who died at the mills, like Luke said.
Before he painted your name over Mister Crain.
Well, it wasn't me. Mister Dudley had to clean it and he knows that he's in charge of all the messes so why would he make more work for himself and... You said the Good Doctor was with you.
I don't know what to think anymore.
I don't know what to think anymore.
Just think about one thing right now: What color?
I've never had a pedicure before.
Well?
Well?
Red. What else?
I'm sorry I was mad at you, Theo.
Me too. Although I learned one thing about you, that you don't know about yourself. You can be a pretty decent bitch.
I'll take that as a compliment. In the city, what kind of place do you live in?
I have a loft.
You want to move to New York, you want to move in with me?
I don't know, you know...
My place isn't like yours, Nell, it doesn't have a view of sea. It doesn't have a view of anything. What's interesting about the way I live is what goes on inside the walls. Living with me... My boundaries aren't very well defined, Nell. Do you know what I mean?
I'm trying. Have you ever kept something to yourself because you were afraid it'd ruin things.
Are you sure?
I think so.
I think so.
Okay.
Marrow said the same thing as last night, he <u>says</u> -- -- that he checked with Mrs. Dudley. And he says that she told him that all the fireplaces in the West Wing connect to the main chimney. He says that he thinks that the flue was open, and with the windstorm, he says that what probably happened was some kind of freak air
-- What do you think?
Then who is? Come on, Nell. Deep down, if you really thought it wasn't Jim, why wouldn't you be leaving right this second? Why wouldn't you be afraid? Really afraid.
Because I don't want to ruin things. Because home is where the heart is.
Nell, what happened?
Carolyn showed me where she hid him, hid him with all the ones he killed --
This is real, I'm not making it up! Theo, you saw it! You were there -- the banging and last night. You, you all saw the painting!
Nell, it makes sense. It all makes sense. You and I, we were scaring each other, working each other up.
Nell, it makes sense. It all makes sense. You and I, we were scaring each other, working each other up.
-- but the painting!
I'm going to stay with you until you fall asleep. And then I'm going to get some brandy.
I don't think I want any.
I don't think I want any.
I do.
They're all in here. All the ones he killed. They're just children! We have to help them!
Come on! Why are we waiting?
What'd you come back for, babe?
Just had to be sure.
Oh, Theo. You know I don't have an apartment.
Then let's go get you one.
Adhara. I told your father, if you're looking for a name, you can't go wrong with a constellation.
I used to hate it. Now I like it.
I used to hate it. Now I like it.
Could be worse, he could've named you Reticulum.

It was better than a telegram.
Who done it, then?
Huh?
Huh?
Snuffed her.
I never said nothin' about nothin' like that. No, no, no. That's not what I wrote to you.
No, but between the lines, eh? Mysterious circumstances, and that.

I dunno. What's he gonna say? They had a fight that night, she drove away, she was upset? I don't even know the guy. Don't get me wrong, Jenny and me were friends, but we didn't travel in the same social circles. She had her life, I had mine.
What more is there.
I'm just sayin' -- it was a steep hillside. There was no moon that night ...
Coulda happened to anyone, man. I never knew her to be reckless. I mean, sure, she would smoke a little grass, or something, have a few drinks. But that's it, nothing more than that.
No, not my girl. Self-control, she had. Point of pride. And people don't change, do they.

Did Jenny know?
Did Jenny know?
Valentine wasn't even there. If he was into something, if she was involved -- who can say. But I'll tell you something. She stood in front of these dudes, man. Eyeballing <u>them</u>. Checking <u>them</u> out. I felt like she was covering <u>my</u> ass that day.
What you gonna do, man? You gonna go to the cops?
Nah, coppers don't do nothing, do they.

All right, I guess.
...Fine. Fine. Well, you might want to drop by the Annex when we open, update your suit--'course, you're in the smock all day.
...Say, where do you get those things anyway?
Specialty store down in Sacramento.
Specialty store down in Sacramento.
Uh-huh.
...Ed, I...
What is it, Dave?
Uh-huh.
Hell, I, I'm not proud of it. But, uh, that's not the worst of it. I got a note. A blackmail note. You know, come across or everybody knows.

Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Well, you know what that would do to me.
Well, you know what that would do to me.
I guess it would be pretty awkward.
I guess it would be pretty awkward.
Awkward?! Ann'd throw me out on my keister! Hell, it's her family's store--*her* store. I serve at the indulgence of the goddamn ownership, Ed.

I only work here! And the lady's husband would know... Oh, Jesus.
I only work here! And the lady's husband would know... Oh, Jesus.
How much to they want, Dave?
How much to they want, Dave?
$10,000! I don't know what to do, Ed. I don't know what I *can* do. Even though I know who the sonofabitch is.
$10,000! I don't know what to do, Ed. I don't know what I *can* do. Even though I know who the sonofabitch is.
...You know... who *who* is?
...You know... who *who* is?
The sonofabitch. The blackmailer. It's, uh, it's no one you know. It's a businessman from Sacramento. A goddamn pansy, Ed. He tried to rope me into some crackpot scheme; I heard him out and then told him to go to hell. And the very next day, the very next day, Ed, I get blackmailed for the same amount.

Well, I guess he don't care that it's obvious.

Mm. How, uh... how did he know that--
Mm. How, uh... how did he know that--
He's staying at the hotel I've gone to with, uh, with the lady in question. Must've seen us.
...Oh, Jesus.
...Why don't you just pay him, Dave?
...Why don't you just pay him, Dave?
That's my capitalization on the Annex! *My* operation, Ed! Christ almighty. That's what I was just talking to Doris about, a way of getting the money from the store that we could hide from Ann.

Embezzling, Ed. From my own goddamn wife!
Please, Ed.
But it's...
But it's...
Please, Ed.
Your place?
I'm at Nirdlinger's. Let yourself in.
I'm at Nirdlinger's. Let yourself in.
OK.
...Dave?
Come on in.
...It ruined me. This money. No annex. I'm all shot to hell.
So you paid the guy?
...What kind of man *are* you?
...Huh?
...Huh?
What kind of man *are* you?
What kind of man *are* you?
Big Dave--
Big Dave--
I'd understand if you'd walked in here. Socked me in the nose. Whatever. I deserved it.

I, uh...
I, uh...
I'm not proud of what I did. But *you*.
Rye.
Just coffee.
Just coffee.
You sure you don't want something stiffer?
...Doesn't become a matter of public record unless there's foul play. However. I don't believe I'm *prohibited* from telling you this. I guess I'm not obliged to tell you, either. I don't exactly know. But if *I* were the man, I'd want to be told.
Told what?
Told what?
I, uh... thanks.
...Hell, I hope I've done the right thing.
My wife and I had not... performed the sex act in many years.
...My first instinct was, no, no, the whole idea was nuts. But maybe that was the instinct that kept me locked up in the barbershop, nose against the exit, afraid to try turning the knob. What if I could get the money?
Honey?
Honey?
Mm.
Where you going?
Me? Us! The party at Nirdlinger's--I told you last week, for the Christmas Push.
Me? Us! The party at Nirdlinger's--I told you last week, for the Christmas Push.
Yeah, right.
Come on, get ready. It's important.
Nah, go ahead. I'm not big on parties.
Nah, go ahead. I'm not big on parties.
Oh, don't be a grump.
...What a knucklehead.
Who?
Who?
Dave.
Dave.
How's that?
How's that?
Ahh...
...Money problems. He's thinking about canceling the Annex.
So?
So?
*That means I don't run Nirdlinger's!*
*That means I don't run Nirdlinger's!*
Mm.
...What's so damn strange about that?
I didn't say a word.
'Gratulations, Gina. It's so goddamn wonderful.
Congratulations, Gina.
Congratulations, Gina.
Life is so goddamn wonderful, you almost won't believe it.
Life is so goddamn wonderful, you almost won't believe it.
Honey...
Honey...
It's just a goddamn bowl of cherries, I'm sure.
Honey.
How are you?
I don't know what's going on. I--
What happened to you?
...I don't know what happened to Big Dave. I know some of it. Irregularities in my books, they said. Can I explain it.
You don't have to--
You don't have to--
I helped him cook the books, Ed. I did do that.
I helped him cook the books, Ed. I did do that.
You don't have to tell them anything. We're getting you a lawyer.
I know all about that. But I don't know how much to tell them.
Don't tell 'em anything. We're getting you Freddy Riedenschneider.
Should I... should I tell you why?
You don't have to tell me anything.
...My books used to be perfect. Anyone could open them up, make sense of the whole goddamn store.
Honey...
Honey...
I knew we'd pay for it.
...Doris--
Nah, don't say anything. I'm alright.
Look, I don't wanna waste your time so I'll eat while we talk. Ya mind? *You* don't mind. So while I'm in town I'll be staying at the Hotel Metropole, the Turandot Suite. Yeah, it's goofy, the suites're named after operas; room's OK though, I poked around. I'm having 'em hold it for me on account of I'll be back and forth. In addition
No. Of course not. She didn't do it.
No. Of course not. She didn't do it.
Good! That helps. Not that she didn't do it, that she didn't confess. Of course, there's ways to deal with a confession, but that's good!--one less thing to think about. Now. Interview. I'm seeing her tomorrow. You should be there. Three o'clock. One more thing: you keep your mouth shut. I get the lay of the land, I tell *you* what to say. No

...OK.
...OK.
Good! Any questions give me a ring-- Turandot suite; if I'm out leave a message. You sure you don't want anything? No?
I knew about it. Big Dave told me about it, and the spot he was putting himself in by getting the money.
Terrific. Your husband backs you up. That's terrific.
...You've gotta give me something to work with. Freddy Riedenschneider is good, but he's not a magician. He can't just wave his little wand in the air and make a plausible defense materialize. Look. Look at what the other side is gonna run at us. They got the company books, prepared by you--*cooked* by you--that's Motive. They got a murder scene *you* had access
It was Big Dave's.
It was Big Dave's.
--don't interrupt me--that's Means. They got a fine upstanding pillar of the business community as a victim, and then they got *you*, a disgruntled number-juggling underling who on the day in question was drunk as a skunk and whose alibi for the time in question is being passed out at home, alone.

*I* was with her.
OK, we forget the blackmail. *You* killed him. How come?
He and Doris... were having an affair.
OK, how did you know?
I... just knew. A husband knows.
Will anyone else say they knew?
I don't know. I don't think so.
I don't know. I don't think so.
How did you get into the store?
How did you get into the store?
I took Doris's keys.
I took Doris's keys.
Will anyone say they saw you there? On your way there? In there? On your was back?
Will anyone say they saw you there? On your way there? In there? On your was back?
...I don't think so.
...I don't think so.
Will anyone corroborate and goddamn part of your story at all?
...I don't get it.
Look, chum, this is a guy, from what I understand, told everybody he was a war hero, right? Island hopping, practically liberated the Pacific all by himself with a knife in one hand and a gun in the other and twenty yards of Jap guts between his teeth.

Yeah.
Yeah.
And now it turns out this dope spent the war sitting on his ass in some boatyard in San Diego. You asked for blackmail, let me give you blackmail: Mr Hale-Fellow-Well-Met, about to open his own business here, has been lying to everybody in this town for the last four years, probably including half the people sitting on that jury. Well, it finally caught
...Did Big Dave mention that it was something about his war service? I don't know, I wasn't there, *you'll* have to tell *us*. Maybe he specified, maybe he didn't; I'm not putting words in your mouth; the point is that this liar, this cynical manipulator, this man who through his lies sneered and belittled the sacrifice and heroism of all our boys who *did*
So... who... who actually--
So... who... who actually--
Who? *Who?!* I don't know who! But the point is that if Mr Prosecutor over there had devoted half the time he's spent persecuting *this* woman to even the most cursory investigation of this schmoe's past, then we might *know* who! But we can't *know* what really happened! Because of Fritz, or Werner, or whatever the hell his name is! And because Me Prosecutor
Not guilty, your honor...
I tried to tell him the whole story, but Riedenschneider stopped me. He said the story made his head hurt, and anyway he didn't see any way of using it without putting me on the hot seat for the murder of Big Dave...
...I gotta hand it to him, he tossed a lot of sand in their eyes. He talked about how I'd lost my place in the universe...
...a puny player on the great world's stage...
...a puny player on the great world's stage...
...how I was too ordinary to be the criminal mastermind the D.A. made me out to be, how there was some greater scheme at work that the state had yet to unravel, and he threw in some of the old truth stuff he hadn't had a chance to trot out for Doris...
...how I was too ordinary to be the criminal mastermind the D.A. made me out to be, how there was some greater scheme at work that the state had yet to unravel, and he threw in some of the old truth stuff he hadn't had a chance to trot out for Doris...
...who among us is in a position to say...
...who among us is in a position to say...
...He told them to look at me--look at me close. That the closer they looked the less sense it would all make, that I wasn't the kind of guy to kill a guy, that I was the barber, for Christ's sake...
...and inflame the passions of these twelve fine men and women...
...Well, he got his mistrial, but the well had run dry. There was nothing left to mortgage; Riedenschneider went home and the court appointed Lloyd Garroway...
Thanks. Thanks for seeing me, at home.
Oh, hell. Drink?
Oh, hell. Drink?
No thanks.
No thanks.
Sure you don't need one?
Sure you don't need one?
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
OK. Boy. Jesus!
OK. Boy. Jesus!
Yeah. What do I, uh...
Yeah. What do I, uh...
Well, of course, I, uh, it's out of my league, criminal stuff. I do, uh, probate, real estate, title search, uh... I'd be absolutely worthless, something like this. Absolutely worthless.
'Scuse me, just finished dinner. Um. Frankly, Doris'd be better off with the county defender.
He a good man?
He a good man?
Bert's OK, sure, he's a good man. I won't kid you though, Ed, nobody around here has any experience with this kind of, er... And I hear they're bringing a prosecutor up from Sacramento. Capital offense. Taking it seriously... Hmm...

No thanks, honey.
...So, uh, who should I--
Well, there's Lloyd Garroway in San Francisco. Probity--you know, no one ever said anything iffy about Lloyd Garroway. Conservative. Jury might like that. Might like that here.
...Probity.
Uh-huh. Is he the best then, for, uh...
Uh-huh. Is he the best then, for, uh...
Well, the best, the money-is-no-object best, for a criminal case, any lawyer would tell you Freddy Riedenschneider. Out of Sacramento. 'Course, I don't know how you're fixed for money.

Uh-huh. He's the, uh...
Yeah, the best.

Now, being a barber is a lot like being a barman or a soda-jerk; there's not much to it once you've learned the basic moves. For the kids there's the Butch, or the Heinie...
...so you tie your own flies, Ed. I mean, if you're really serious. You tie your own flies, you do a--I know it's matickless, I know, people say, hey, you can buy flies at the store-- but you can buy your fish at the store, Ed, you see what I'm saying?
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
The point is there's a certain art to the process. The point is not merely to provide, and let me point out, these fish are not as dumb as you might think.

Sportsmanship! That's my point. June fly, Ed? Mosquito? Which of these? Well, what fish do you seek?
Sportsmanship! That's my point. June fly, Ed? Mosquito? Which of these? Well, what fish do you seek?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Sure, go to the store. Go there, describe to the man where you will be fishing, and for what, and the weather conditions, sun, no sun, whatnot, and so forth, and then you might as well have the man go ahead and sell you the goddamn FISH, Ed...
...You sure, Eddie?
Yeah, yeah--go home.

The hell with it, Eddie!
They're just people like you and me, Ed. Remember that.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Just people. They gotta put up the big front so that people will trust them with their money. This is why the big lobby, Ed. But they put their pants on one leg at a time. Just like you and me.

Uh, Vince. Sorry. This won't wait.
It better be good.

There are a couple of kids who were lost yesterday near the site of the murder. Claimed they saw a monster. They're pretty determined to tell you their story. You want to see them?

No.
Manual overrides aren't working. I'm getting nothing, Lieutenant.
Great.
There's some kind of animal loose in the museum. Pendergast's alone. He needs help. I want volunteers to go with me.
I'm in.
Beauregard! You scared me half to death.
I'm sorry, sir. You okay?
I'm sorry, sir. You okay?
Someone broke into this room.
Someone broke into this room.
Anything missin'?
Anything missin'?
Doesn't look like it. We're damned lucky. This statue is priceless.
Looks like the curse is still at work.
The claws are sharp... I must have cut myself. Better move these crates to the secure storage area where they'll be safe.
Don't know if it'll do any good, Mr. Cuthbert.
Why not?
Why not?
No one broke into this room, sir. Someone broke out. That lock was torn off from the <u>inside</u>.
We all love the museum. I come here myself with my kids. We're trying to work with you.
I appreciate that.
I'm telling you, something's wrong. I still haven't heard from Pendergast. I think you should call it off.
It's too late now. Guests are arriving. The Mayor's car is pulling up.

I'll go down and speak to him.

You haven't got the authority. Only Pendergast can pull the plug.

Pendergast may be in trouble. Don't you understand? He still hasn't come back. It's been over three hours --
Pendergast may be in trouble. Don't you understand? He still hasn't come back. It's been over three hours --
He'll be back. Relax. We're in good shape. Your security is air tight. There've been no more incidents, nothing suspicious. There's no reason to call off the opening now.
Sweet Jesus!
Get his gun and his walkie talkie, Jonathan. Move.
Get his gun and his walkie talkie, Jonathan. Move.
My office is on the third floor! There's a walk-in safe and a portable phone! We can lock ourselves in the safe and call for help!

I have to help Pendergast. Kawakita and Jonathan stay with me. The rest of you can go with Cuthbert!
I had no idea the Museum had a complete collection of Piranesi's Forum sketches.
If you like them, they're for sale. Another day like yesterday and half the collection will be on the block.
If you like them, they're for sale. Another day like yesterday and half the collection will be on the block.
I've read about the Museum's financial troubles.
I've read about the Museum's financial troubles.
We've been operating in the red for years. That was the whole idea behind the Superstition Exhibit. It was designed to pull people in. We've spent every penny we have on advance publicity, betting everything on the opening's success. If we postpone at the last minute... No. I don't want to think about that.
If the party goes forward, and that's a big if... I've arranged for a large police presence.
Do they have to wear uniforms?
Do they have to wear uniforms?
Yes.
Yes.
I don't want to scare people.
I don't want to scare people.
I understand. But Mr. Cuthbert, we've got bigger problems. Depending on what we find today, we may have to shut you down.
I got it after I was mugged in the subway last spring.
Where's the walk-in safe?
Where's the walk-in safe?
Behind you.
Behind you.
What's the combination?
What's the combination?
I'll do it. Just let me find my portable phone.
Forget it!
Calm down. I found it!
Battery's dead. Shit.
Let's go!
That thing won't come after us, right? It's going for bigger game. The group blundering around in the basement. Poor fools.
Hurry up!
Hurry up!
Just a minute. I'm shaking! Take the gun.
For Chrissake, I'll do it. What's the combination?!
To the left twice then five no... sorry... I think it's fifteen... it's been a while...
To the left twice then five no... sorry... I think it's fifteen... it's been a while...
Oh Jesus...
Fifteen... what's next?
Eight to the right! Look! I found it!
This huge police presence tonight isn't necessary, Lieutenant. You'll just scare people off. I can handle the security behind scenes with this system. It's state of the art.
The cops are non-negotiable, Ippolito. Why don't you just tell me how this space station works.

It's fool proof, basically. I designed this whole thing myself. Every valuable object in the Museum carries a small electronic chip. If anything's moved so much as an inch, we get an alarm pinpointing the exact location of the attempted theft.

That's great if you're stopping a burglar. Not our goal here. Are there motion detectors?

In every exhibition room. The museum's divided into five cells. The reception and exhibit are in cell five. We could arm the motion detectors in cells one to four, then seal the perimeter with our fire doors.

That would leave one exit for hundreds of people. You'd be violating every fire regulation on the books. We'll guard the perimeter with my men and engage the motion detectors in the other cells. One more question. I see a big hole. If this entire thing is run by computer, what happens if the power fails?

You don't know much about computers, Lieutenant. There are safeguards built in. We have back-up systems with redundancies. There's no way these computers can fail.
The whole system is shutting down! We have to get out quickly before the fire doors fall!
What doors?
What doors?
I told you! They seal off all the cells. They were designed to fall automatically in a system failure --

It's a little late, you son of a bitch. There's a friggin' monster loose in here! Get the FBI, the fire department. Find metal cutters, cut through. And bring a cannon. The damn thing is huge.
Who are you? The undertaker?
Special Agent Pendergast. FBI.

The body?
What's left of it.

We need light in here, stat.
Where's the head?
Careful. That mess on the ground is brains.
Whose footprints?

Night watchman who found the body. Sweet old man. Been tossing his cookies for over an hour. Not a likely suspect.
An original Roger Tory Peterson of a Red-Breasted Merganser. Amazing. I have a copy of this in my office at home.

Who didn't? Big news. Out of Brazil, wasn't it?
Who didn't? Big news. Out of Brazil, wasn't it?
Yes. That's my case. Now it's yours. All the corpses were badly mutilated in a very particular way. Decapitated. Brains extracted. Limbs torn to shreds. It looked like the work of a large animal, but there was no sign of an animal on board.

So the method of death is the only connection?
So the method of death is the only connection?
No. There's more. There were crates from this museum in the hold of the boat.
If you don't mind, this could be important.
You're kidding.
You're kidding.
Unfortunately, no.
I've got to admit, that was a damn sight better than "the dog ate my homework".
How do you explain the part about Beauregard?

You think what we've got here is a monster as big as a house that smells... like hamburger?
No. I think what we've got here is a psychotic killer wielding some kind of unusual weapon... who wants us to believe he's a monster.

Oh.
What happened to them?
If you don't mind a suggestion, you might try a saliva test.
Saliva test? You mean, you think someone ate part of the brain?
Correct.
I don't like animals. Never have. Dog bit me when I was little. After that I gave up on pets. Animals are irrational. Give me a psychotic killer any day. If there's one thing that makes me queasy it's being part of a food chain. My first case as a rookie, two brothers climbed a fence at the zoo. It was late August. Over
This isn't an animal, Vince. I've been on this case four months, remember? I've learned a few things.

You've been holding out on me Pendergast. You have a suspect capable of this?
How big is the sub-basement?
Apparently it's huge.

I think I should come with you.
I think I should come with you.
We haven't got time. You have to meet with museum security so we can make a decision about tonight.
Pendergast! Help! It's right behind us!
This door's locked. Try shooting the hinges off.
Vince? There's no way we can get to you with the fire doors down. There's an entrance to the sub- basement in the hall off the north side exit.
The sub-basement?
The sub-basement?
I've been down there. It links up to the old sewer system. I can guide you out.
I smell it. It's here.
Go out the north exit! There's a hallway and a false wall by the Greek vases. Run!
Go out the north exit! There's a hallway and a false wall by the Greek vases. Run!
Everybody. Get behind me.
Nice to see you, Lieutenant.
The sub-basement, huh? Great idea.
This place is a maze.
I'm one of the few who know every inch it, now that John is gone.
Look. It's some kind of letter.
May I see that?
Did you hear that? My God. He says that Mbwun is real!
Pardon my French, but bull shit.
Pardon my French, but bull shit.
This on top of the scratches... isn't it proof!
Shouldn't a drug that powerful be destroyed?
The virus itself might have positive applications. They'll keep the plants in secure lock up while the studies are made. Greg isn't joining us?
Lieutenant! It's me.
What is it?
What is it?
Dr. Green has to see you!
Dr. Green has to see you!
Got my hands full here.

It's important. Please. You have to come! Pendergast, too. She's found out something.
What happened?!
There's a dead body in the exhibit! People are panicking, trampling each other trying to get out.
It's still back there!
I know.
How much ammo do we have to make a stand?
You're asking me? I don't even know how to load this thing.
All right. Kawakita, cover the rear.
Oh shit.
I believe in you a hundred percent, Vince, but that's the second time we've been at that intersection.
Not so loud.
What's that?
All right everybody, hold up!
What does it say?
Dr. John Whittlesley.
Dr. John Whittlesley.
What's that doing here?

I don't know. I thought Dr. Whittlesley died in South America.
Dear God. Where are we, Lieutenant?
I'd say we're in its home.
We've met. The Hacksaw Murders. '89.
Oh yes! Who could forget. Afterwards you sent me that amazing case of Chateau Lafitte.
Oh yes! Who could forget. Afterwards you sent me that amazing case of Chateau Lafitte.
I hope you liked it.

Lovely bouquet. After our last case, Vince took me out for a draft beer. As I recall we split the check.
What are we talking about here?
Someone who makes the Hacksaw Murderer look like Mother Teresa.

Right. The entire brain appears to have been extracted. May I see it, please?
Curious. There's something missing.
The thalamus and the hypothalamus, perhaps?
The thalamus and the hypothalamus, perhaps?
Yes. Two organs the size of a walnut have been removed with what looks like surgical precision.
Yes. Bit of a shock. But as Cuthbert so tactfully put it, the museum needs new blood. And since I've been here since the Mesozoic Era --
I don't believe it.
I don't believe it.
Now Margo, don't overreact. Cuthbert has to cut costs somehow. My leaving makes perfect sense. This isn't exactly early retirement. I've overstayed the party a bit.

That, apparently, is the problem. I'm yesterday's news. Who needs a Curator of Plant Biology in a museum with one exhibit on plants? Monsters and dinosaurs, cannibals and shamans are the new currency of the realm.
Please. Don't humiliate me further.
Let me help. I can take care of everything.

Come on. I'll walk you back to the elevator.
I'm not giving up.
I'm not giving up.
You must.
This isn't a death sentence. Greg has promised to teach me fly fishing. I'll garden. I'll write.
You are this museum. It won't be the same without you.
You are this museum. It won't be the same without you.
Everyone needs a change of scenery. I've been rolling down these halls for forty-odd years. That's quite enough.
That Cuthbert. What a piece of work. Someone's dead and all he cares about is his Superstition Exhibit.
Cuthbert's counting on the exhibition's success. The museum is in debt. Contributions and public funding have dried up. Admissions no longer cover overhead. The last big infusion of cash we had was the King Tut exhibit. Cuthbert was hired to get us out of the red. If the Superstition Exhibit isn't lucrative, he'll have to start auctioning off some of these gems.
I can't help thinking there's something that Pendergast overlooked. If the scratches were made by whatever killed Beauregard, it wants something that's in here.
A blow dart. Seed pods. A plant press. Pretty unimpressive stuff.
A blow dart. Seed pods. A plant press. Pretty unimpressive stuff.
Let me see the plant press.
What is it?
I'm not sure. As you know, the Kothoga lived outside civilization on the tepui for thousands of years. Species flourished in isolation when man and pollution rendered them extinct. This could be one of the last remaining samples of an unknown plant.

Whatever it is, it must be common on the tepui. John used it as packing material.

You're right.
Margo, these aren't seed pods.
What are they?
What are they?
They're eggs.
Like the claw.
Let's not jump to conclusions. This egg could belong to any number of reptiles, Dr. Frock.
Let's not jump to conclusions. This egg could belong to any number of reptiles, Dr. Frock.
Come on, Margo. We're on the verge of something huge. Let's consider the possibility, just the three of us, alone in this room. What if John was right. I mean, what if? And he sent back an egg of his monster in the crates. When it got to the museum, it hatched.
Come on, Margo. We're on the verge of something huge. Let's consider the possibility, just the three of us, alone in this room. What if John was right. I mean, what if? And he sent back an egg of his monster in the crates. When it got to the museum, it hatched.
Several problems with that theory. For one thing, this egg is intact. For another, according to Pendergast, the crates were shipped here on a boat. Everyone on board was killed like Beauregard. If the thing hatched in mid-ocean, where did it go?
Look at this. An ambyloid reovirus protein. That explains why the computer's confused. The plant's infected with a virus.
That's not so unusual. Many plants carry viruses. Like the burls on Maple trees.
That's not so unusual. Many plants carry viruses. Like the burls on Maple trees.
But a virus normally codes for other viruses. This one's making human and animal proteins. Listen to this. "Glycotetraglycine collagenoid. Weinstein's tropic hormone. 4- monoxytocin supressin hormone."
All right, assuming the program is accurate, this is a description of the animal with that claw. "Species unidentified. Genus: unidentified. Phylum unknown. Male, weight in excess of 240 kg. Brain capacity, 900 centimeters." That means it's highly intelligent. "Quadrupedal."
Quadrupedal! The other name for Mbwun. "He Who Walks on All Fours."
"Nocturnal. External hair and bony plates. Locomotor speed 60-70 kilometers. Reduced optic chiasm"... poor eyesight. "External mucoid nasal glands,"... very keen scent... "Morphological characteristics: Highly robust. Aggressiveness: extreme."
So the claw came from a huge creature with a preternatural sense of smell and poor eyesight that hunts at night.

Some kind of power failure. Maybe it's the storm. Do you have a flashlight?

I think so.
Dr. Frock. Did you hear that?
Don't stop now.
What's that?
It's one of the fire doors. Good Lord, Margo. We're trapped!
None of that matters now. The people upstairs need us. We have to help.
We can't. We've managed to get inside the one place that's safe. I think we should sit tight and wait for reinforcements. If we go outside, we're risking more lives. You have to accept it, Margo, there's nothing we can do. The building must be swarming with police by now. It won't take long for them to get through the doors.

That thing could kill ten people in a matter of minutes.
I'm coming with you.
No, Dr. Frock. You can't.
Come back and get me.
We will.
We will.
Remember, it has poor eyesight. It hunts with its sense of smell. So for God's sake, Margo, don't get those fibers on your clothes!
Dr. Frock?
Look who's here, Margo.
Thank you for taking the time to help us with this, Dr. Frock.
Happy to be useful. It's rare enough these days. According to security, Beauregard put the Whittlesley crates in storage area 1012.
Happy to be useful. It's rare enough these days. According to security, Beauregard put the Whittlesley crates in storage area 1012.
How many storage areas are there?
How many storage areas are there?
They fill seven floors. We have the largest collection of mammals and dinosaurs in the world. Just to give you an idea, there are more than three million insects specimens. Not to mention amphibians, reptiles, birds, anthropological artifacts, meteorites, minerals and gems. Only about five percent of the museum collection is actually on display.
Do you mean Dr. Whittlesley?
Yes. John made quite a study of the whole museum. He had a copy of my original plans.
Something tried to get into this room!
And failed. These doors are solid steel.

"Dear Louis, Tomorrow we go to the south end of the tepui where we'll be in the greatest danger, so I'm sending Carlos back with the crates. You always believed in me, Louis, even in the darkest days. So it gives me great pleasure to tell you your faith has been rewarded. We've made an incredible find. I enclose a representation of Mbwun.

You said John Whittlesley made a study of your blueprints of the museum.
Yes.
Yes.
Are there any hidden rooms or staircases? Places where someone could hide?

You said you had plans of the museum. Could we see them, please?
We think it may have something to do with the eggs we found in the crate.
I don't believe it.
Margo, this is too dangerous. You always think you can solve everything. This time you don't have enough information. The animal might behave in unexpected ways. Leave her here with me. Don't put her in danger.
He's right.
What's that?
Footsteps!
Dr. Frock, I was wondering. What happened to the rest of Whittlesley's plants?
They were sent to the Center For Disease Control in Atlanta.
You work here?
Yes, I do.

We were just lost, okay? And we went down this curvy staircase. At the bottom was a big shadow.
Big as a house.

Well almost. Depends which house. It smelled like old hamburger, and it made this weird noise.
And it snuffled the ground like a dog.
Like this.
It had a long tongue, teeth this big and yellow eyes.
They were green eyes and they were slit like a lizard's.

They've got something.
Keep the light up. I can't see.
Shut them up!
Heel Argo! Hobbes! Heel!
Stop!
Holy mother, what is that?
Argo! Hobbes!
Get back! Now!
There's something out there! Let's go get it now! That's why we came down here, isn't it?
He's right. Follow me.
Look. It's Hobbes! He's all right.
Come on. Let's get back to the others. We can't leave them alone.
Come on. Let's get back to the others. We can't leave them alone.
It's alright. I can tell by the way the dog's acting that whatever was out there is gone. What is this place?

Not on the map. Looks like it connects with the city sewer.

Another storage room.
Oh no. I smell it.
Keep the animal quiet.
If I spent half the time on my Fractal Evolution thesis that I spend on this fly rod, I'd have my PhD.
But at what a price.
I have the species identification on these teeth. We can extract DNA and start running tests on the extrapolator program. Call Dr. Frock. He wanted a demonstration.
Margo, you haven't heard?
Margo, you haven't heard?
What?
What?
Frock's been fired.
That's impossible.
I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad tidings, but you know me. Telegraph. Telephone. Tell Kawakita. I got the definitive word from Cuthbert's secretary. This is Dr. Frock's last week.
For once I'm glad you're rumor central. What in the world is going on?
Someone's been murdered. Not shot, strangled or stabbed, either. Torn limb from limb. There's talk of a psychotic killer or even an animal.
Mbwun.
What's that?
What do you make of it, Margo?
It's not mammalian, that's for sure. I think it's reptilian.
Turkish Gecko, I believe. A lizard.
Lizard DNA and human DNA on the same strand? Impossible. The sample must be contaminated.
Lizard DNA and human DNA on the same strand? Impossible. The sample must be contaminated.
There's another possibility. A lot of repeated base pairs could suggest a high level of genetic damage.
What kind of egg is it?
It's reptilian.
These plant fibers are loaded with hormones!
What kind of hormones?
4-monoxytocin is... "A hormone secreted by the human hypothalamus gland."
Try Weinstein's tropic hormone.
This is it. This is what he, or it... is after! The plant has high concentrations of the same hormones found in minute quantities in the human brain!
So what?
So what?
Pendergast told me the killer extracts and eats the hypothalamus and thalamus of the victim's brains!
Pendergast told me the killer extracts and eats the hypothalamus and thalamus of the victim's brains!
Eats them?
Eats them?
Yes. Whatever killed Beauregard may have lived on this plant. When the crates were put in secure storage, they were out of reach. The killer couldn't get them, so it got the next best thing.
Is Dr. Frock safe!
Yes, he's fine. Greg... take care of yourself!
Got to finish this thesis sometime.
How about lunch?

No. I came to talk about Dr. John Whittlesley.
Somehow, when all this happened... I knew it would come back to John. Is he really dead?
Maybe not.
Maybe not.
If he were alive he'd have contacted me.
If he were alive he'd have contacted me.
You have time to talk?
Dr. Whittlesley was last seen in Belem, Venezuela a week after the rest of his expedition disappeared. A taxi driver drove him to the harbor where he boarded a cargo boat. That boat washed up in my district. Everyone on board was killed.
And John?
And John?
Disappeared. His body wasn't among the victims.
Disappeared. His body wasn't among the victims.
I don't understand.
I don't understand.
The people killed were mauled and their brains were eaten. Just like Beauregard. One part of the brain was extracted with surgical precision. The hypothalamus and thalamus to be exact.
John couldn't have anything to do with a horrible thing like that. He was a fine man despite his problems --
You loved him.
You loved him.
Yes. Once. We met at Columbia. John held the Cadwalader Chair in Statistical Paleontology when I was a grad student there.

He was afraid of himself. He tried suicide once. He was ill. Manic depressive. He had wild emotional highs and lows. Not a happy affliction for a scientist. He'd been revered in our community. By the end he was a joke.

A legendary monster called Mbwun.
A legendary monster called Mbwun.
A monster?
A monster?
Yes. He developed his own theory that he called the Calisto Effect. It held that evolution wasn't always gradual or driven by natural selection. The environment would sometimes cause sudden and grotesque changes which could result in a "monster species". It made no sense. But he felt he had evidence that Mbwun was such a monster, living in isolation on the tepui for thousands

No one knows. The Kothoga who live on the tepui are cannibals.
No. I'm all right. I won't let this affect me anymore. John wouldn't get help. His ego endangered the lives of others. His theory came first.
What if Whittlesley arrived on the tepui and no monster was there? Was he desperate enough to create one?

It's okay, I'm all right. I remember now... It was an animal. Something large! I could smell it. It was hunting me. I saw two green eyes in the dark.
Where did you see it?
Where did you see it?
Behind me. Over there.
That's not what I saw.
All right. If you're positive.
Dr. Green...
I didn't imagine it. I know what I saw. Are you sure there are enough men in there?

All right. This is hard for me. I'm a scientist. I like order and logic. Sometimes too much. There's got to be an explanation. There can't be an animal in there. But I saw something.

What was it?
What was it?
I don't know. Mr. Pendergast. Do me a favor. Get me a DNA readout on that claw.
Genetic damage?
When DNA is defective, it often uncontrollably replicates long repeating sequences of the same base pair. Viruses can damage DNA. So can radiation, certain chemicals. Even cancer. Let's let the G.S.E. sort it out. I have to get started. This will take several hours.

We need someone to take us to the secure storage area.
Pendergast? Are you all right?
No. I think I'm hallucinating.
You're not. Where is it?
Gone.
Gone.
Wounded?

No. A chromium alloy tipped .45 caliber bullet bounced off that thing's skull like a spit ball. I think it was bothered by my light.

That would fit. It's nocturnal. Quick. Come inside.
I don't know how to deal with this. It's hellish. Like nothing I ever saw. I'm not trained to deal with a monster, a supernatural creature like that.
It's not supernatural. Mbwun is an animal. Part lizard, part human, a genetic freak of some kind, like the half-goat, half-sheep they found last year in the jungles of Vietnam.
It's not supernatural. Mbwun is an animal. Part lizard, part human, a genetic freak of some kind, like the half-goat, half-sheep they found last year in the jungles of Vietnam.
But this isn't the jungle! This is New York. How did it get here? A thing like that crossed two continents. It makes no sense!
But what can we do? Our guns are useless --
We have the fibers. Don't you see? The creature is hungry. It wants the hormones in these plants. It would take hundreds of human brains to supply what's in these fibers. We're just a poor substitute. To make it stop hunting, we have to give it what it wants.
You'd slow us down and put Margo in danger.
Unlock one of the other storage rooms. We're going upstairs. We'll leave a trail back to 1012 and try to trap the monster in here.
That was D'Agosta.
The planetarium!
The planetarium!
Vince!
Is there another way around?
No. The planetarium is in the next cell. This is one of the fire doors...
Hide quickly!
What are you going to do?
What is it doing?
It's scared of me.
What happened?
Its eyesight is worse than I thought. It couldn't see us. And it couldn't smell us through the glass.

No. It's still hunting, but not for the hormones.
For what?
For what?
I think... for the pleasure of the kill.
We have to try and draw it off!
How?
How?
The answer's right in front of us.
That's a ptarmigan, feigning a broken wing. The bird pretends to be injured to draw the fox away from its nest!
It's deceptively simple. Like a Bruckner Symphony or a Matisse.
Help someone!
Oh God! Help!
You smell that?
It's coming. Run.
We're not going to make the storage room!
Listen to me, Pendergast. Mbwun's DNA is part homo sapien. In primates, the eye is a direct path to the brain! If you get a clean shot, there's only one place you can kill it. Shoot it in the eye!
No! Don't kill him! Pendergast, you were right. It's John!
What?
What?
That thing is John Whittlesley. I should have seen it before! The fibers are infected with a virus. You eat them, and the virus alters your DNA! He became addicted to them in South America, followed the plants back to the states. He probably entered the country as a man. It would have taken several months for the change to take place. That's how
I don't believe it.
You have to! Listen! All viruses pass on their own DNA. Instruct the cells of the host to make more viruses! This one was different. It inserted a whole array of genes into John. Reptile genes, sixty five million years old. Those genes remade him! It's not his fault!

Whatever that thing is, we have to kill it!
Just like John. He won't listen.
I have to shoot.
I have to shoot.
Do it, quickly. Please. Aim for the eye.
He has to look here or I won't get a clear shot. Call him, Margo.
I can't!
I can't!
You have to. Do it now!
I'm so glad to see you. What's the occasion?
I'm in town on a case. Dropped by to see Vince and we thought we'd see the new display.

The catalyst for the recent dramatic events was of course Truman's father, Kirk, and his infiltration onto the show. Before we discuss that, it's worth reminding viewers that this isn't the first time someone from the outside world has tried to reach Truman.

Let's talk ratings. "Truman" has always enjoyed top ten status but the huge surge over the last few days--how do you hope to sustain that audience now that Truman appears to have reconciled himself?
As you know ratings have never been our primary goal. I imagine we'll lose those voyeurs only interested in witnessing Truman's latest torment. However, I'm certain that our core audience will remain loyal.

But recent events have been so dramatic, it does raise the perennial question. What keeps us watching this one man twenty-four hours a day - eating, sleeping, working, sitting for hours in contemplation?

It has to be the reality.
We've become tired of watching actors give us phony emotions, bored with pyrotechnics and special effects. While the world he inhabits is counterfeit, there's nothing fake about Truman himself. No scripts, no cue cards. It's not always Shakespeare but it's genuine. That's how he can support an entire channel.
A window onto the human condition?

I prefer to think of it as a mirror.
Not only does he give us a glimpse of the truth, he gives us a glimpse of ourselves.

As with our own lives, the only people he can't cast are his family. Otherwise he has final approval, able to elevate an extra into a lead role as was the case with his only real friend, Marlon, or alternatively relegate a star to a bit player.

Istanbul, Turkey, you're on with master videographer, Christof.
We should remind viewers that Truman, especially as a child, presented a challenge for the production.
Let me demonstrate some examples.
He was curious from birth - premature by two weeks, as if he couldn't wait to get started.
Of course, his eagerness to leave his mother's womb also meant he was the one selected.

Who knew that a show originally meant to last one year - "Bringing Up Baby" - would turn into a "cradle to grave" concept. He is in fact the first child in the world to be legally adopted by a corporation.

Why do you feel that Truman's never come close to discovering the true nature of his world?
We accept the reality of the world with which we're presented. As the show expanded, naturally we were forced to manufacture ways to keep Truman in Seahaven - demonstrating that every venture is accompanied by a risk.
You've never actually met Truman, yourself. Never thought about doing a cameo--playing a veterinarian, or a priest, something like that?
I've been tempted. But I think it's important to retain objectivity. I wouldn't want to get emotionally caught up.

Maybe I feel like a teenager.
Maybe I feel like a teenager.
We're mortgaged to the eyeballs, Truman. There's the car payments. Are we just going to walk away from our financial obligations?
It'd be an adventure.
I thought we were going to try for a baby. Isn't that enough of an adventure?
I thought we were going to try for a baby. Isn't that enough of an adventure?
That can wait. I want to get away. See some of the world. Explore.
This'll pass. Everybody thinks like this now and then. Come to bed.
I think I'm going to stay up for a while.
What're you doing down here?
Fixing the mower. I saw my father today.
Fixing the mower. I saw my father today.
I know.
I know.
How do you know?
How do you know?
Your mother called. You shouldn't upset her like that.
What did you want?
I made macaroni.
I made macaroni.
I'm not hungry.
Come on, Truman. Haven't you studied enough?
I still want to look over a couple of things.
I'll take you home, Angela. Why don't you leave those with us for a while?
Good night, Mother.
Good night, Mother.
See you in a minute, sweetheart.
I have to talk with you. But not here. Let's go for a walk.
I'm sorry, I'm late.
I'm sorry, I'm late.
What's the hurry?
What's the hurry?
Surgery. The elevator disaster downtown on the news last night. Cable snapped, a car dropped ten floors. Non-union contractors. Monsters. We're starting with an amputation.
Arrah!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
What do I do?
What do I do?
I don't know--
I don't know--
--you're a nurse, aren't you?
--you're a nurse, aren't you?
Put some butter on it--or ice?
I invited Marlon and Rita for a barbeque Sunday. I thought I'd make my potato salad. Remind me--
I won't be here Sunday.
I won't be here Sunday.

You're upset because you want to go to Fiji. Is that it?
Let's go now.
What?!
Where shall we go? Where shall we go? Spontaneity is what it's all about. Forget Fiji. We can't very well drive to Fiji, can we? What about Atlantic City?
You hate gambling.
You hate gambling.
That's right. I do, don't I?
That's right. I do, don't I?
So why do you want to go?
So why do you want to go?
Because I never have. That's why you go places, isn't it?
Because I never have. That's why you go places, isn't it?
Truman, I think I'm going to throw up.
Blocked at every turn. Beautifully synchronized, don't you agree?
You blaming me for the traffic?
You blaming me for the traffic?
Should I?
Truman, that was our house!
I've changed my mind again. What's New Orleans like this time of year? Mardi Gras. Or let's just see where the road takes us.
I've changed my mind again. What's New Orleans like this time of year? Mardi Gras. Or let's just see where the road takes us.
Let me out, Truman. You're not right in the head. You want to destroy yourself, you do it on your own!
Let me out, Truman. You're not right in the head. You want to destroy yourself, you do it on your own!
I think I'd like a little company.
It's hard to go places, isn't it?
There's been an accident, Truman.
There's been an accident, Truman.
Uhuh. There's no accident. It's just more stalling.
Truman, I took the "hypocrite" oath!
I bet you did.
Truman, what about that sign?
I'm sure they're just exaggerating.
So what do we do for money when we get to New Orleans?
I've got my Seahaven Bankcard.
I've got my Seahaven Bankcard.
So we just eat into our savings, is that the idea? I'd better call your mother when we get there. She'll be worried sick - I don't know how she's going to take this.
Let me get you some help, Truman. You're not well.
Why do you want to have a child with me? You can't stand me.
Why do you want to have a child with me? You can't stand me.
That's not true.
Why don't I make you some of this new Mococoa Drink? All natural. Cocoa beans from the upper slopes of Mount Nicaragua. No artificial sweeteners--
--What the hell are you talking about?!
--What the hell are you talking about?!
I've tasted other cocoas. This is the best.
What the hell has that got to do with anything? Tell me what's happening?!
You're having a nervous breakdown, that's what's happening.
You're having a nervous breakdown, that's what's happening.
You're part of this, aren't you?!
Stop this now. I'll do it. I swear.
Do something...
Who were you talking to?!
You're the one talking to the walls!
You're the one talking to the walls!
No. You said, "Do something." Who were you talking to? Tell me!
No. You said, "Do something." Who were you talking to? Tell me!
Truman, stop it!
--What are my plans now? Well, next I'm thinking of tackling the Yuba River in an authentic canoe from the Algonquin tribe. --I'm talking about the north fork, a class five rapid - only I'm not going <i>down</i> the Yuba, I'm going <i>up.</i> Do you honestly think for one minute I'd go back to some dreary office to rubber stamp meaningless documents...do you?
--Truman, you're gonna be late!
How are you, Mother?
Well, I made it through another night.
Well, I made it through another night.
How's your hip?
How's your hip?
Oh, just so.
You know surprises aren't good for me. You should really call before you come over, dear.
I've got something to tell you. You'd better sit down.
You look very pale, Truman. Are you taking your vitamin D's?
I spend half my life out in the sun, Mother, why would I need vitamin D?
I spend half my life out in the sun, Mother, why would I need vitamin D?
I feel certain my condition runs in the family. Can't this wait, dear?
It doesn't sound insane, Truman. I swear I see him ten times a week--in a hundred faces. I almost hugged a perfect stranger in the salon last Thursday.
It was Dad, I swear, dressed like a homeless man. And you know what else was really strange? A businessman and a woman with a little dog appeared from nowhere and forced him onto a bus.

I'm telling you, if it wasn't him, it was his twin. Did Dad have a brother?
I'm telling you, if it wasn't him, it was his twin. Did Dad have a brother?
You know he was an only child, like you. I know how bad you feel about what happened--sailing into that storm. But I don't blame you, Truman. I never have.
We ought to be getting you back, Mother.
Hold on a minute, dear. Here's us at Mount Rushmore. You remember, Truman--when Dad was still with us - that was quite a drive. You slept all the way there.

It looks so small.

I'm looking for my wife--Nurse Burbank. It's important.
I'm afraid that's impossible--she's in pre-op.

Sure. Okay. Fine. Can you pass on a message?

Tell her, tell her...I had to go to Fiji. I'll call her when I get there.

Fine. I'll tell her.
Now what?
Leak at the plant. They had to shut her down.

You're welcome, Truman.

I don't understand.

You must listen. Everybody's pretending, Truman.
How's it going, Truman?
Not bad. I just won the State Lottery.

Good. Good.
Good. Good.
Tyrone, what if I said I didn't want meatball today?
Tyrone, what if I said I didn't want meatball today?
I'd ask for identification.
See you tomorrow, Truman.
You can count on it.
Do you live around here?
Yeah.
Not supposed to talk about it.
You're not supposed to talk about it? Who told you that?
I think you better tell us.
We don't even know you.
We don't even know you.
Well, we're FBI agents.
Well, we're FBI agents.
You're not FBI agents.
Poopy day?
Yup.
Yup.
A woman? Work.
What do you do?
What do I do. I'm a key figure in an ongoing government charade. An annoyance to my superiors. A joke among my peers. "Spooky," they call me. Spooky Mulder. Whose sister was abducted by aliens when he was a kid. Who now chases little green men with a badge and a gun, shouting to the heavens and anyone who'll listen that the fix is
I think that about does it, Spooky.
Does what?

Why don't you go home to the old lady --

You were shot in the head. The bullet broke the flesh on your right brow and glanced off your temporal plate.

Penetration but not perforation.
They gave you a craniotomy to relieve the pressure from a subdural hematoma. But you've been unconscious since they brought you in.
When was that?
Scully had a violent reaction to a bee sting --
You called 911. Except the call was intercepted.

Me?

I apologize for making you wait -- I've brought some new evidence with me --

You've been back to Dallas?
Yes.
Yes.
Are you going to let us in on what exactly you're trying to prove --

Yes. I know.
And you have conclusive evidence of this? Something to tie this claim of yours to the crime --
Nothing completely conclusive --
I hope to. We're working to develop this evidence --
Working with?
Working with?
Agent Mulder.
What is it you find incredible?
Well...where would you like me to start? Antarctica is a long way from Dallas, Agent Scully. I can't very well submit a report to the Attorney General that alleges the links you've made here. Bees and corn crops do not quite fall under the rubric of domestic terrorism.

No, they don't.
No, they don't.
Most of what I find in here is lacking a coherent picture of an organization with an attributable motive. I realize you're very lucky to be alive Agent Scully. The ordeal you've endured has clearly affected you -- though the holes in your account leave this panel with little choice but to delete these references from our final report to the Justice Department. Until
You've got something to show me.
Yes.
We brought the atmosphere back down to freezing in order to control the development, which is nothing like we've ever seen.
Brought on by what?
Brought on by what?
Heat, I think. The coincident invasion of a host, the fireman, and an environment that raised his basic body temperature above ninety eight point six.
This man's still alive.
Technically and biologically, though he'll never recover.
How can this be?
The developing organism is using his life energy, digesting bone and tissue. We've just slowed the process.
Do you want me to destroy this one, too? Before it gestates?
No. No...we need to try our vaccine on it.
No. No...we need to try our vaccine on it.
And if it's unsuccessful?

Of what?

They seemed to buy our story about the Hanta virus. You'll make sure the families are taken care of financially, along with a sizeable donation to the community. Maybe a small roadside memorial.
Yes.
We have a situation. The members are assembling.

Is it an emergency?
Who called this meeting?
Strughold. He's just gotten on a plane in Tunis.
Its effect on the host has changed. The virus no longer just invades the brain as a controlling organism. It's developed a way to modify the host body.
Into what?
My lateness may have well been absence. A course has already been taken.
There are complications.
Do they know?
Mulder was in Dallas when we were trying to dispose of evidence. He's gone back there again. Someone has tipped him.

Feds are looking for him, too. Real nice business he's got, huh?
What's that?
What's that?
Selling naked pictures of little kids over his computer.
You looking for him for some other reason?
Yeah, I had an appointment for a pelvic examination.
You want a call if we turn up Kurtzweil?
No. Don't bother.
I'm looking for anything out of the ordinary. Maybe something from the FEMA offices where the bodies were found.
We weren't expecting to find those remains, of course. They went right off to Washington.

No. Just fossils, far as I know.

Show you right on a map.
How's that?
Standing around holding your yank while bombs are exploding.
Do I know you?
No. I've been watching your career for a good while. Back when you were just a promising young agent -- before that.
You follow me out here for a reason?
Yeah, I did.
My name's Kurtzweil. Dr. Alvin Kurtzweil.
I know the name. Why?
I know the name. Why?
Old friend of your father's.

No. They put the bomb in the building across the street because it DID have federal offices. The Federal Emergency Management Agency had a provisional medical quarantine office there. Which is where the bodies were found. But that's the thing...

Before the bomb went off?

And are you familiar with FEMA? What the Federal Emergency Management Agency's real power is?

What killed those men can't be identified in simple medical terms. My god, we can't even wrap our minds around something as obvious as HIV.

A plague?
A plague?
The plague to end all plagues, Agent Mulder. A silent weapon for a quiet war. The systematic release of an indiscriminate organism for which the men who will bring it on still have no cure. They've been working on this for fifty years. While the rest of the world was fighting gooks and commies these men have been secretly negotiating a planned Armageddon.

Something's gone wrong -- something unanticipated. Go back to Dallas and dig. Or you're only going to find out like the rest of the country, Agent Mulder. When it's too late.
How can I reach you?
You can't.
You found something?
Yes. On the Texas border. Some kind of experiment. Something they excavated was brought there in tanker trucks.

Mulder... when a terrorist bomb threat is called in, the logical purpose of providing this information is to allow us to find the bomb. The rational object of terrorism is to promote terror.

Mulder...?
What happened to playing a hunch?
Jesus, Mulder...
The element of surprise, Scully. Random acts of unpredictability. If we fail to anticipate the unforeseen or expect the unexpected in a universe of infinite possibilities, we find ourselves at the mercy of anyone or anything that cannot be programmed, categorized or easily referenced...
I know you're bored in this assignment, but unconventional thinking is only going to get you into trouble now.
How's that?

Now what?
It's locked?
Had you.
No you didn't.
No you didn't.
Oh yeah. Had you big time.
I saw your face, Mulder. There was a moment of panic.
Panic? Have you ever seen me panic, Scully?

Hang on. I'm gonna get you out of there.

Whatever you told them in there, you don't have to protect me.
All I told them was the truth.

This isn't about you, Scully. They're doing this to me.
This isn't about you, Scully. They're doing this to me.
They're not doing this, Mulder. I left behind a career in medicine because I thought I might make a difference at the FBI. When they recruited me they told me women made up nine percent of the bureau. I felt this was not an impediment, but an opportunity to distinguish myself. But it hasn't turned out that way. And now, if I were to

You're... quitting?
You're... quitting?
There's really no reason left for me to stay anymore. Maybe you should ask yourself if your heart's still in it, too.
I wake you?
No.
No.
Why not? It's three AM.
Are you drunk, Mulder?
I was until about an hour ago.
I was until about an hour ago.
Is that before or after you got the idea to come here?
What are you implying, Scully?
I thought you may have gotten drunk and decided to come here to talk me out of quitting.

Is that what you'd like me to do?
Go home, Mulder. It's late.
Get dressed, Scully.
Get dressed, Scully.
Mulder -- what are you doing?
Mulder -- what are you doing?
Just get dressed. I'll explain on the way.
This is one of the firemen who died in Dallas?
According to this tag.
According to this tag.
And you're looking for?
It's like jelly.
There's some kind of cellular breakdown. It's completely edematous.
And there's been no autopsy performed. There's no Y incision here; no internal exam.
You're telling me the cause of death on the report is false. That this man didn't die from an explosion, or from flying debris.

I don't know what killed this man. I'm not sure if anybody else could claim to either.
You knew this man didn't die at the bomb site before we got here.
I'd been told as much.

You're saying the bombing was a cover-up. Of what?

Mulder, this is going to take some time, and somebody's going to figure out soon enough we're not even supposed to be here. I'm in serious violation of medical ethics.

Why are you whispering?
I can't really talk right now.

Evidence of a massive infection.

Mulder -- I can't -- I'm already way past the point of common sense here --
You said you weren't coming?
I wasn't planning on it. Particularly after spending a half hour in cold storage this morning. But I got a better look at the blood and tissue samples I took from the firemen.

What did you find?
What did you find?
Something I couldn't show to anyone else. Not without more information. And not without causing the kind of attention I'd just as soon avoid right now. The virus those men were infected with contains a protein coat I've never seen before. What it did to them it did extremely fast. And unlike the AIDS virus or any other aggressive strain, it survives very nicely

How was it contracted?
How was it contracted?
That I don't know. But if it's through simple contact of blood to blood, and if it doesn't respond to conventional treatments, it could be a serious health threat.
He didn't mention a park.
This is where he marked on the map, Scully. Where he says those fossils were unearthed.
This is where he marked on the map, Scully. Where he says those fossils were unearthed.
I don't see any evidence of an archeological or any other kind of digsite. Not even a sewer or a storm drain.
You're sure the fossils you looked at showed the same signs of deterioration you saw in the fireman's body in the morgue?
The bone was porous, as if the virus of the causative microbe were digesting it.

And you've never seen anything like that?
And you've never seen anything like that?
No. It didn't show up on any of the immunohistochemical tests --
This looks like new grass to you?
It looks pretty green for this climate.
Ground's dry about an inch down. Somebody just laid this down. Very recently, I'd say.
All the equipment is brand new.
All the equipment is brand new.
No irrigation system. Somebody's covering their tracks.
Unmarked tanker trucks... what are archaeologists hauling out in tanker trucks?
I don't know, Mulder.
I don't know, Mulder.
And where are they going with it?
And where are they going with it?
That's the first question to answer, if we're going to find them.
What are my choices?
About a hundred miles of nothing in each direction.

We've got two choices. One of them is wrong.
You think they went left?
I don't know why I think they went right.
Hey, I was right about the bomb, wasn't I?
This is great. This is fitting.
What?
I've got to be in Washington D.C. in eleven hours for a hearing -- the outcome of which might possibly affect one of the biggest decisions of my life. And here I am standing out in the middle of nowhere Texas, chasing phantom tanker trucks.

Been where?
Been where?
Pounding down some dirt road in the middle of the night. Chasing some elusive truth on a dim hope, only to find myself standing right where I am right now: at another dead end --
What do you think it is?
I have no idea.
This is weird, Mulder.
Very weird.
Very weird.
Any thoughts on why anybody'd be growing corn in the middle of the desert?

Where'd they go?

What? What's wrong?
Salt Lake City, Utah. Transfer effective immediately.
I already gave Skinner my letter of resignation.

You don't Mulder -- you've never needed me. I've only held you back. I've got to go.
Why was I assigned to you? To debunk your work. To reign you in. To shut you down.
You saved me, Scully. As different and frustrating as it's been sometimes, your goddamn strict rationalism and science have saved me a thousand times; have kept me honest and made me whole. I owe you so much, Scully, and you owe me nothing. I don't want to do this without you. I don't know if I can. If I quit now, they win.
What? What happened?
I think... something stung me.
Scully...
Something's wrong... I'm having -- lancinating pain -- my chest. My... motor functions are being affected. I'm...
...my pulse feels thready and I've got a funny taste in the back of my throat.
I think you're in anaphylactic shock --

I've got no allergy. Something... this... Mulder... I think... I think you should call an ambulance.
Cold...
Hang on. I'm going to get you out of here.
We've got to keep moving.
Where are we?
Where are we?
You got me. But I think I know what they did with Jimmy Hoffa.
I can't go any farther.
Yes you can. You're going to make it, Scully.
We're going to the morgue.
That area is currently off limits to anyone other than authorized medical personnel.

She was with me.
You don't see what's going on here, do you? There's four hundred million dollars in damage to the city of Dallas. Lives have been lost. No suspects have been named. So the story being shaped is this could have been prevented. That the FBI didn't do its job.
And they want to blame us?

She's missing. We've been unable to locate her or the vehicle they took her in.
Whoever they are -- this goes right back to Dallas -- it goes right back to the bombing --

Your aliens, Agent Mulder, your little green men, first landed here millions of years ago. Those that didn't leave have been laying dormant underground since the last Ice Age. In the form of an evolved pathogen. Waiting to be reconstituted when the alien race from which it came returns to colonize the planet. Using us as hosts. Against this we have no defense. Nothing
Until Dallas, we believed the virus was simply a controlling organism. That mass infection would make us a slave race.

Imagine our surprise when they began to gestate. My group has been working cooperatively with the alien colonists, facilitating their programs. To give us access to the virus. In false hope we might be able to secretly find a cure. So that we might save ourselves, as the last of the species. Your father wisely refused to believe this, choosing hope over selfishness. Hope
But... he sacrificed his own daughter. My sister, Samantha.
The only true survivors of the viral holocaust will be those immune to it: those vaccinated against it and human/alien hybrids. Your father arranged for your sister's abduction. He allowed her to be taken to an alien hybrid program, so that she would survive. As a clone. He had different hopes for you. That you would uncover the truth about the Project. That you

How?
How?
The vaccine you hold is the only defense against the virus. Its introduction into an alien environment may have the power to destroy the delicate plans we've so assiduously protected for the last fifty years. Or it may not.

We began to worry. Some of us have traveled so far, and you are the last to arrive.
I'm sorry. My grandson fell and broke his leg.
More concerns than that?
We've been forced to reassess our role in Colonization by new facts of biology which have presented themselves.
My god...
The geometry of mass infection presents certain conceptual re-evaluations for us. About our place in their Colonization.

This isn't Colonization, it's spontaneous repopulation. All our work... if it's true, then they've been using us all along. We've been laboring under a lie!
We're going to tell them what we've found. What we've learned. Turn over a body infected with the gestating organism.
In hope of what? Learning that it's true?! That we are nothing more than digestives for the creation of a new race of alien lifeforms?!

Let me remind you who is the new race. And who is the old. What could be gained by withholding anything from them; By pretending to ignorance? Our knowledge may forestall their plans to step up the timetable. To start Colonization early.

Cooperation is our only chance of saving ourselves.
Our vaccine may have no effect!
Well, without a cure for the virus, we're nothing more than digestives anyway.
We've allowed this man his freedom. His books have actually helped us to facilitate plausible denial. Has he outlived his usefulness to us?
No one believes Kurtzweil or his books. He's a toiler. A crank.

As far as I needed.
There's always a chance they'll confess.

Just like we all have fantasies, right? Things only we know, that we don't share.
That's what therapists are for, right?
With Stargher I saw things...
What did you see?
What did you see?
A kingdom. His utopia. Life without consequence or restriction. He's not even Carl Stargher anymore. He's this... idealized version of himself who can do anything he pleases... Without fear. A horrible primitive ugly thing. I don't want to talk in here.
Why'd you bring him here?
You're the shrink, you tell me.
You're the shrink, you tell me.
As soon as I met him, you knew I'd say yes. He makes Julia real for me.
You thought Stargher wanted to be caught.
I did, yeah.
I did, yeah.
You were right. There's a part of him that knows the truth. About what he did, about himself.
What about Julia?
This is going to sound terrible, but... I don't think she matters anymore. Not to him. He never finished her. The others...he was able to make them his.

You think you can do this, don't you?
You think you can do this, don't you?
He might tell me about Julia. The part of him that wants to help, that feels shame and remorse. Who wants to be redeemed.

This is Stargher we're talking about?
This is Stargher we're talking about?
Not Stargher, not really. He's split himself right down the middle. Good/evil, right/wrong, merciful/cruel. A monster. And an innocent child. If I could reach the boy.

Whoa. Hold on. Aren't they the same guy?
Whoa. Hold on. Aren't they the same guy?
Don't you feel there are different sides to every personality? Maybe even the worst of us is capable of one decent act. We're all human.
Don't you feel there are different sides to every personality? Maybe even the worst of us is capable of one decent act. We're all human.
It's hard for me to see Stargher as human, capable of something like "remorse."

Then what is he?
Then what is he?
Evil.
Evil.
If you believe that.

Maybe this is a big fucking waste of time.

What happened to Charles Gish?
What happened?
What difference does it make...?
What difference does it make...?
Tell me.
A child can experience abuse worse than Charlie's. And grow up to be someone who would never, ever hurt another living thing.
You're sure of that?
You're sure of that?
Yes. I am.
Remember, Julia Hickson is priority number one. Nothing else matters. Find out where she is.
Okay, okay...
Wait...
Like hell "wait."
He wants us to follow. The little boy...
Little boy?! That's him!
Little boy?! That's him!
He brought you to me, didn't he? If you want Julia to live, trust me. Trust him.
Where the hell are we?
Carl, do you know? Like on a map...
COME ON!
I can't leave him!
That went well.
Give her a minute. Hello, Valentine.
You sure about this?
Absolutely. Abigail...
I heard Julia and John got married.
Yep. Eloped.
Yep. Eloped.
Good for them.
Well look at that.
I told you. You have to be optimistic. Believe in them...
I told you. You have to be optimistic. Believe in them...
So you say.
He's mine?
All yours. My boss says it's one of the strangest requests the Bureau's ever had.
He also says that until proven differently, Julia Hickson was found as a result of good old-fashioned detective work.
It doesn't matter...
It doesn't matter...
I don't know. I think it does. You know, Catherine... If you ever want to talk about it. What happened to Stargher. That last time.
They're hungry.
I got it.
Thank you.
No problem.
No problem.
No. Thank you.
You liked him?
He's beautiful...
What now?
's broken.
Who says?
Mocky-Lock.
Mocky-Lock.
Oh no... No you don't.
Oh no... No you don't.
"Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman. Mocky-Lock wants me where I am."
"Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman. Mocky-Lock wants me where I am."
I bet we can fix it.
She the one from Santa Cruz?
Just graduated law school. Single mom. Had a two-year-old daughter.
Agent Cole.
I need you to find something in the basement...
I need you to find something in the basement...
Already there.
Already there.
That hoist, with the winch...
Lattimer sold the hoist to a guy named Bainbridge who tired to build a machine works out near Delano. Bainbridge ends up in bankruptcy court and the state winds up with the land - it's just sitting there.
Delano?
Delano?
Yep. And guess who they hired to seal up the place?
Yep. And guess who they hired to seal up the place?
You're kidding me.
You're kidding me.
I never kid. My wife hates it. Says I'm too serious.
Shouldn't we get a catheter in him?
They took care of that, thank you, Henry.
Not a gift. A highly evolved area in her cerebral cortex, that's all. A genetic fluke.
Catherine has a tremendous capacity for empathy. When we started, there were a number of test subjects - other therapists - who acted as "receivers." All they did was observe and report. Nothing more. But Catherine, she had the ability to feel what was happening. She understood. And the patient responded. Edward engaged her in dialogue, took her places, showed her things. He knew
Intravenous administration complete.
Initiating connection.
That's why we monitor the use of the drugs so closely. We don't want her getting to that degree of perceptual disorientation.
Pump in two liters of pure oxygen, please Henry.
I hate to admit it, but there's something perversely satisfying about this.
I think that's the whole point.
She changed the codes.
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
It would take hours to re-route the system, and even if I did, I shouldn't.
Instead of going into his mind...
She's bringing Stargher into hers.
When did he lapse into the coma?
Sometime yesterday morning.
What about the legalities of this...?
Stargher is in custody. The functional equivalent of being under arrest. Normally, we'd Mirandize him, and if he didn't lawyer up, we'd interrogate him. But because of his condition, he doesn't have the capacity to waive those rights.
Catherine!
I'll get her...
When we got here, you just topped and pulled her out.
That was with Edward. She's accustomed to his world. Stargher's mind is unfamiliar territory. She's "lost." Someone has to go in. Remind her what's really happening. And get her out. Until then, she's at his mercy.
Into Stargher. Inside...
Yes.
I have done this, you know. Been inside.
No.
Nervous?
Absolutely.
I have to ask you some things... Are you taking any prescription drugs?
Prevacid. For my stomach.
Prevacid. For my stomach.
Any psychiatric medication?
Any psychiatric medication?
No.
No.
What about narcotics?
What about narcotics?
No.
No.
I know your partner's here, but it's very important that you're honest.
I know your partner's here, but it's very important that you're honest.
I am. I'm a pretty boring guy.
I am. I'm a pretty boring guy.
I doubt that.
Is she alright?
Yes. But you're going to sit down right now. I have to...
Agent Novak.
Dr. Kent.
Dr. Kent.
You're looking well.
You're looking well.
Thanks you. Six weeks off does a body good. I heard she got the approval to try the reversal with Edward.

That's a secret.
That's a secret.
Federal Bureau of Investigation, ma'am. We know all, see all...
How's the patient.
Awaiting his arrival.

What about the cat?
What about the cat?
Completely unaware.
Someone looking after her little girl?
Grandparents. Live over in Davis.
So?
Anne Vicksey didn't own a dog.
I need it.
Now?
Now?
Now.
The dog's an albino. He'd love an animal like that.
Gentlemen, I believe an albino dog is rare indeed.
The Phoenix office tested that hair thirty minutes ago. And we got the match.
It's his dog.
How is she?
Pregnant. Thanks for asking.
Here he is.
Damn, man, I give up. Your partner tells you his wife's gonna have a baby, and all you care about is a coroner's report!
Breeders typically destroy albino pups, so this animal is truly unique.
Nicole Labetzki. Victim seven. Forensics found dog hair in her car, but they had a K-9 unit at the scene and never had it checked.
After three years she remembers what the guy drove?
She remembers because it was her "dream truck." Wanted one just like it.
We proceed assuming she is.
Let's give old Carl a call. Tell him he's got company.
Let's give old Carl a call. Tell him he's got company.
No. Can you get a man close?
We'll go back to his house, Pete. There's still a lot to do. Analyze the videos, track sales of the bleach, go through his records. Maybe he owns property somewhere.
They're in that fucking thing for forty hours, Gordon. Four-oh. He got Julia at seven-thirty last night. You know what time it is now...?!
You sure you want to go through with this?
What else do we do?!
What else do we do?!
I don't know, Pete, but for god's sake... This is nuts. Do you really understand what they're going to do?
I don't know, Pete, but for god's sake... This is nuts. Do you really understand what they're going to do?
I don't have to.
I don't have to.
Why jeopardize what we've already done? We caught the sonofabitch. Carl Stargher. That's going to be like Bundy, Gacy, Dahmer. A case that makes careers. But if we push our luck. If this is all bullshit and we come out smelling like it.

Tell you what. If this thing burns us, I take that heat. I give you permission to point your finger at me and say "It was all his idea."
Tell you what. If this thing burns us, I take that heat. I give you permission to point your finger at me and say "It was all his idea."
That's not what I'm talking about, Pete. I'm talking about waking up and realizing this girl's gonna die.
Right here.
Next time, tell me, okay?
Next time, tell me, okay?
But you looked so cute. All sleepy...
Jesus Christ, man, you look like hell.
Considering where I've been...
You're bettin' the farm on something you saw after they pumped you full of god knows-what kind of shit?
I saw her. Julia. Alive. I saw everything.
I saw her. Julia. Alive. I saw everything.
You might've seen Jimmy Hoffa dancing with Timothy Leary. I don't care.
Ich weiss nicht.
Das mussen sie doch wissen. Ich meine ohne grund wird die politzei doch nicht ins Hans komme Fraulein Schmidt, ein schande...
Den leuten.
Ja, ja, ja.
Ja, ja, ja.
Sayen sie ed our den Leuten damit sie es auch wissen.
Hier sind fruher Fursten ans unt eingeganger. Hier hat sogar ein Metternich verkehrt...
Give her some cigarettes.
Give her some cigarettes.
Das worren nooh zeiten.
Warscheinlich ist der murder.
They think you did it.
Thank you.
Sit down.
Sit down.
Thank you. I enjoyed the play very much.
You were awfully good.
Do you understand German?
Do you understand German?
No, no...oh...excuse me.
But I could follow it fine. Perhaps Harry told you about me. My name's Holly Martins.
No, he never told me about his friends. Would you like some tea?
Well, I saw you at the funeral.
I'm so sorry, I didn't notice much.
I'm so sorry, I didn't notice much.
You were in love with him, weren't you?
You were in love with him, weren't you?
I don't know. How can you know a thing like that afterwards. I don't know anything any more.
Oh, American, thank you. I like them.
I was talking to another friend of Harry's. A Baron Kurtz - do you know him?
No.
He has a little dog.
He has a little dog.
Oh, yes, yes.
Don't understand what Harry saw in a fellow like that.
That was the man that brought me some money when Harry died. He said Harry had been anxious at the last moment.
He said he remembered me too. Seems to show he wasn't in much pain.
Dr. Winkel told me that.
Dr. Winkel told me that.
Dr. Winkel? Who is he?
Dr. Winkel? Who is he?
The doctor Harry used to go to. He was passing just after it happened.
The doctor Harry used to go to. He was passing just after it happened.
His own doctor?
His own doctor?
Yes.
Yes.
Were you at the inquest?
Yes. They said it wasn't the driver's fault. Harry often said what a careful driver he was.
He was Harry's driver?
He was Harry's driver?
Mmmm.
...at all.
I know. I wondered about it a hundred times, if it really was an accident.
I don't know. They didn't answer.
I was told there were only two men there.
You shouldn't get mixed up in this.
Well, if I do find out something, can I look you up again?
Well, if I do find out something, can I look you up again?
Why don't you leave this town - go home?
What's she talking about?
The police. They're searching my room. Sie mussen doch wissen.
Anything really wrong with your papers?
They're forged.
They're forged.
Why?
Why?
The Russians would claim me. I come from Czechoslovakia.
Oh, what was the name of that doctor? Harry's doctor?
Dr. Winkel.
Drink?
Whiskey.
Harry?
Yes. He moved his head, but the rest is good, isn't it?
Who are you looking for now?
Sssh. Don't. Don't, please.
Sssh. Don't. Don't, please.
Silly looking bunch.
The Porter is going to talk to us tonight.
Need we go through it all again?
Might as well I suppose. Are you busy?
Just another part I've got to learn.
Can I hear you?
In German?
In German?
I can try. Is it comedy, or tragedy?
I can try. Is it comedy, or tragedy?
Comedy. I don't play tragedy.
Do I...
Well you read this.
Gestern bein heurigen...
What's that?
What's that?
"Ein hurigan" - I guess.
H-E-Z-T...
Oh, let me see. No, no that's not the cue. It means she has to sit down.
Tell me about him.
Tell you what?
When...what did you do?
Oh, we didn't make much sense. Drank too much. Once he tried...
...to steal my girl.
Where is she?
Oh, that was many years ago.
Tell me more.
Tell me more.
Oh, it's very difficult. You know Harry...we didn't do...
...and buried him.
Anna.
Seemed like a good idea.
It's just what he used to say.
It's just what he used to say.
Well, I didn't learn that from him.
Well, I didn't learn that from him.
If we have to see the Porter we'd better go.
If we have to see the Porter we'd better go.
What's the hurry? Can't we talk quietly for a couple of minutes?

I thought you wanted...
I thought you wanted...
A moment ago you said you didn't want to see the Porter.
A moment ago you said you didn't want to see the Porter.
We're both in it, Harry.
We're both in it, Harry.
Holly.
Holly.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
It's all right.
That's Harry's place, isn't it?
Yes.
Let's go away.
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
Let's not get into any more trouble.
Let's not get into any more trouble.
Wait here.
Sneak out the other way, and go back to your theatre. I'd better not see you again.
What are you going to do?
What are you going to do?
I wish I knew.
I wish I knew.
Be sensible - tell Major Calloway.
Wer ist da?
Me.
I thought you were going to go away. Aren't the police after you?
I don't know.
I'm going back home.
Why?
What happened to your hand?
A parrot...Let it go.
A parrot...Let it go.
Have you seen Calloway?
Have you seen Calloway?
Can you imagine a parrot nipping a man?
Can you imagine a parrot nipping a man?
Have you?
...you know.
He told you, didn't he?
He's better dead. I know he was mixed up - but not like that.
I knew him for twenty years - at least I thought I knew him. I suppose he was laughing at fools like us all the time.
I knew him for twenty years - at least I thought I knew him. I suppose he was laughing at fools like us all the time.
He liked to laugh.
He liked to laugh.
Seventy pounds a tube. He wanted me to write for his great medical charity.
Seventy pounds a tube. He wanted me to write for his great medical charity.
I'll put these flowers in water.
...and my lover. He was Harry.
Well, don't preach wisdom to me. You talk about him as if he had occasional bad manners.
...again.
There isn't enough for two laughs.
Are you going, too?
Oh...
...is there?
How did you know I would be here?
...Headquarters.
Have you been seeing Major Calloway again?
Harry.
I'm sorry.
What is on your mind? Why did you hide?
Hide? Can't a fellow have a drink?
Here, it will be cold on that train.
I shall be all right.
I shall be all right.
You send me a wire as soon as you arrive.
What is going to happen? Where is Harry?
He's safe in the Russian zone.
He's safe in the Russian zone.
How do you know?
How do you know?
I saw him today.
Did he say anything about me - tell me?
Oh, the usual things...
Oh, the usual things...
There's something wrong. Did you tell Calloway about meeting Harry?
Of course I didn't tell Calloway.
Why should he help me like that? The Russians will only make trouble for him.
That's his headache.
His.
His.
Oh, well.
Oh, well.
Why are you lying?
Why are you lying?
We're getting you out of here, aren't we?
...quarrel?
If you want to sell your service, I'm not willing to be the price... I loved him. You loved him. What good have we done him. Look at yourself, they have names for faces like that.
...anyway?
From Kurtz. They have just been arrested. But Harry won't come, he's not a fool.
Good evening, Miss Schmidt. You remember me?
Of course.
Of course.
I helped Harry fix her papers, Mr. Martins...
Cigarette, Miss Schmidt?
Thank you.
Thank you.
Keep the packet.
Nichts danke. Kein.
Entschuldigen sie. It was a terrible thing.
...parents.
Yes.
Must you take those letters? CALLOWAY Yes, I'm afraid so.
They're Harry's.
They're Harry's.
That's the reason.
That's the reason.
You won't learn anything from them. They are only love letters. There are not many of them.
You won't learn anything from them. They are only love letters. There are not many of them.
They'll be returned to you, Miss Schmidt, as soon as they've been examined.
They'll be returned to you, Miss Schmidt, as soon as they've been examined.
There's nothing in them.
Right. Sit down Miss Schmidt, we will send your letters and things back to you.
And my passport?
You know as much as I do, Miss Schmidt - you were intimate with Lime, weren't you?
We loved each other, do you mean that?
Do you know this man?
I have never seen him.
Joseph Harbin...
No.
No.
He works in a military hospital.
He works in a military hospital.
No.
No.
It's stupid to lie to me, Miss Schmidt. I'm in a position to help you.
In one of his letters he asked you to telephone - a good friend of his called Joseph. He gave you the number of the Casanova Club. That is where a lot of friends of Lime used to go.
It wasn't important.
You can help us.
What can I tell you but that you have got everything upside down.
Now then, Miss Schmidt, I'm not interested in your forged papers - that's purely a Russian case. When did you last see Lime?
Two weeks ago.
I want the truth, Miss Schmidt. We know he is alive.
It's true then?
Joseph Harbin's body was found in the coffin.
What did you say? I'm sorry...
I said another man was buried in his place.
Where's Harry?
Where's Harry?
That's what we want to find out.
That's what we want to find out.
I'm sorry - I don't seem able to understand anything you say. He's alive now this minute - he's doing something.
I'm sorry - I don't seem able to understand anything you say. He's alive now this minute - he's doing something.
Miss Schmidt, we know he is somewhere across the canal in the Russian sector... You may as well help us. In a few minutes Colonel Brodsky will be questioning you about your papers. Tell me where Lime is.
Miss Schmidt, we know he is somewhere across the canal in the Russian sector... You may as well help us. In a few minutes Colonel Brodsky will be questioning you about your papers. Tell me where Lime is.
I don't know.
I don't know.
If you help me, I am prepared to help you. ANNA Martins always said you were a fool...
Vienna is a closed city, Miss Schmidt, he can't get away.
Poor Harry, I wish he was dead, he would be safe from all of you then.
Must you take those?
They'll be returned, miss.
They'll be returned, miss.
They are - private - letters.
They are - private - letters.
That's all right, miss, don't worry. We're used to it - like doctors.
There you are, miss, your receipt for the letters.
I don't want it.
I don't want it.
Well, I've got it when you want it, miss.
Here we are. You'll be all right here, Miss.
I don't...
Thank you, you have been so kind. Anna moves down to stand CL of Paine.
Well, I'll be saying good night. Good night, Miss.
Well, I'll be saying good night. Good night, Miss.
Good-bye.
Yes.
I was a friend of Harry Lime.
I would very much like to meet you, Baron. Come around.
Austrians aren't allowed in your hotel. Couldn't we meet at the Mozart cafe?
Austrians aren't allowed in your hotel. Couldn't we meet at the Mozart cafe?
Where?
Where?
Just around the corner.
Just around the corner.
How will I know you?
How will I know you?
I'll carry a copy of one of your books. Harry gave it to me.
What is it?
This is forgery. It is very clever.
We are interested in this case. Have you arrested the girl?
No, not yet.
Please keep this passport to yourself, until I make some inquiries, will you, Major?
Yes, of course.
Yes, of course.
Thank you.
...Austrian Police Headquarters.
Can I have that woman's passport?
Can you tell me whose...
Fellow called Lime.
My name is Calloway.
Martins.
Martins.
You a friend of Lime's?
You a friend of Lime's?
Yes.
Yes.
Been here long?
Been here long?
No.
You've had a bit of a shock, haven't you? You could do with a drink.
Could you buy me one. I haven't got any Austrian kroners. Thanks.
Could you buy me one. I haven't got any Austrian kroners. Thanks.
Schmolka!
Back in school. Never so lonesome in my life till he showed up.
When did you see him last?
When did you see him last?
September '39.
See much of him before that?
Once in a while.
I'm afraid I've never heard of you. What's your name again?
Holly Martins.
Holly Martins.
No, sorry.
Did you ever hear of "The Lone Rider of Santa Fe?"
I can't say that I have.
I can't say that I have.
"Death at the Double X Ranch" - Ra- a-nch.
"Death at the Double X Ranch" - Ra- a-nch.
No.
Must have known I was broke. Even sent me an airplane ticket. It's a shame.
What?
What?
Him dying like that.
Him dying like that.
Best thing that ever happened...
...to him.
What are you trying to say?
What are you trying to say?
He was...
...policemen. I have to call them sheriffs.
Ever seen one?
Ever seen one?
Pin it on a...
...a cop. You're a real cop I suppose.
It wasn't petrol.
Why don't you catch a few murderers for a change?
Well, you could say that murder was part...
Listen, Callaghan.
Calloway - I'm English, not Irish.
...expense.
Going to find me the real criminal? It sounds like one of your stories.
What the devil?
Getting around, Martins.
Getting around, Martins.
Oh, pinning things on girls now.
And there was a third man there. I suppose that doesn't sound peculiar to you.
I'm not interested in whether a racketeer like Lime was killed by his friends or by accident. The only important thing is that he's dead.
Tactful too, aren't we, Callaghan?
Calloway.
Miss Schmidt.
You're not locking her up?
Get the next plane.
As soon as I get to the bottom of this, I'll get the next plane.
As soon as I get to the bottom of this, I'll get the next plane.
Death is at the bottom of everything, Martins. Leave death to the professionals.
Death is at the bottom of everything, Martins. Leave death to the professionals.
Do you mind if I use that line in my next Western? You can't chuck me out, my papers are in order.
What do you want to see a doctor for, huh?
A bruised lip.
A parrot bit me.
Oh, stop behaving like a fool, Martins.
Oh, stop behaving like a fool, Martins.
I'm only a little fool - I'm an amateur at it - you're a professional. You've been shaking your cap and bells all over town.
Well?
In Vienna...
Do you see what that means?
Are you too busy chasing a few tubes of penicillin to investigate a murder?
That is the racket Harry Lime organized.
Calloway, you haven't shown me one shred of evidence.
Next, Paine.
I would like a word with this orderly Harbin.
So would I.
Bring him in.
Bring him in.
I can't. He disappeared...
...a week ago.
It's more like a mortuary than police headquarters.
...be responsible for you in the streets.
I'm not asking you to.
...in the morning.
Thank you. Excuse me.
I followed his shadow until suddenly...
Well?...
Well?...
This is where he vanished.
This is where he vanished.
I see.
I see.
I suppose you don't believe me.
I suppose you don't believe me.
No.
No.
Look...I tell you, you don't think I'm blind, do you?
Look...I tell you, you don't think I'm blind, do you?
Yes. Where were you when you saw him first?
Yes. Where were you when you saw him first?
Fifty yards right down there.
Fifty yards right down there.
Which side of the road?
Which side of the road?
I was on that side, the shadow was on that side, and no turnings on either side.
I was on that side, the shadow was on that side, and no turnings on either side.
How about the doorway?
How about the doorway?
I tell you I heard him running ahead of me.
I tell you I heard him running ahead of me.
Yes, yes, yes, and then he vanished out there, I suppose with a puff of smoke and like a clap of...
It wouldn't work.
We'll never get him in the Russian zone.
We'll never get him in the Russian zone.
Calloway, you expect too much. I know he deserves to hang, you proved your stuff. But twenty years is a long time - don't ask me to tie the rope.
Calloway!
Oh, there you are. Come in here, there isn't much time.
A girl of spirit.
She's right. It's none of my business.
Didn't I?
You all did.
Do you mind if I drop off somewhere on the way? I've got an appointment, won't take five minutes...
Of course.
Of course.
Why don't you come in, too - you're a writer... Might interest you.
Paine lent me one of your books; "Oklahoma Kid," I think it was. Read a bit of it... Think it's pretty good. What made you take up this sort of thing? Been doing it for long?
All right, Calloway. You win.
All right, Calloway. You win.
I never knew there were snake charmers in Texas...
I never knew there were snake charmers in Texas...
I said you win.
I said you win.
Win what?
Win what?
I'll be your dumb decoy duck.
What time is it?
Two thirty.
Calloway, can't you do something about Anna?
I'll do what I can, if she'll let me.
Wait a minute - let me out.
Well, there's not much time.
Well, there's not much time.
One can't just leave - please.
Be sensible, Martins.
I haven't got a sensible name, Calloway.
Please be careful, sir. Up we come. Written anything lately?
Take him to Sacher's.
It's a military hotel.
I'm so glad to have met you, sir. I've read quite a few of your books.
Write her out a receipt, Paine. Give her a receipt for these letters too.
This way, miss.
Very good, sir.
You know, Paine's one of your devoted readers. He's promised...
...of Santa Fe."
I'd like to visit Texas one day, sir.
Shall I go over there, sir?
No, no. Leave them for a while.
Get me Major Callaghan on the phone.
Oh, Mr. Martins...
...excuse me.
Please hurry up - just get him on the telephone.
Please hurry up - just get him on the telephone.
Do you know his number?
Do you know his number?
No, I don't know...
...his number.
I'll look it up for you.
I'll look it up for you.
Well, look, is there a car here I can use?
You do!
Yes, Cultural re-education Section Propaganda. Very important in a place like this. We do a little show each week. Last week we did "Hamlet" and the week before we had something...
Welcome?
I'll tell you what, Mr. Martins. On Wednesday night at our institute, we are having a little lecture on the contemporary novel...I thought perhaps you'd like to speak.
They wouldn't know me.
Nonsense. Your novels are very popular here. Aren't they, Sergeant?
How long can one stay here on this stage money?
Listen, Mr. Martins, if you'd agree to be our guest, we'd be delighted to have you.
Come upstairs a moment.
I know a very good dentist.
I know a very good dentist.
I don't need a dentist. Somebody hit me, that's all.
It was just a soldier. I was trying to punch his major in the eye.
No, a major, were you really?
No, a major, were you really?
Heard of Harry Lime?
Heard of Harry Lime?
I've heard of him, of course, but I didn't exactly know him.
I was going to stay with him, but he died Thursday.
Goodness, that's awkward.
Goodness, that's awkward.
Is that what you say to people after death? "Goodness that's awkward..."
...this lecture business, you'll put me up here a while?
Certainly.
Seems exciting.
It is, and I'm gunning just the same way for your Major Callaghan.
Oh, Mr. Martins, good evening.
Good evening Mr. Crabbin.
Hello - Mr. Martins, we tried to get you at your hotel. We have arranged that lecture for tomorrow.
What about?
What about?
On the modern novel - you remember what we arranged and we want you to talk on the Crisis of Faith.
What's that?
Oh, I thought you would know, you're a writer. Of course you do. Good night, old man.
Well, yes. I suppose that is what I meant to say.
Of course, of course, of course.
Zane Grey.
Oh, that is Mr. Martins' little joke, of course...
Mr. Crabbin.
What is it, Sergeant?
What is it, Sergeant?
Mr. Holly Martins, sir.
Mr. Holly Martins, sir.
Who?
Who?
The author. Thought you might be interested.
The author. Thought you might be interested.
Never heard of him.
Never heard of him.
Oh, he's very goad, sir. I've read quite a few of his books.
Oh, he's very goad, sir. I've read quite a few of his books.
Have you, Sergeant? Author - Martins. Thank you, Sergeant.
Striptease, sir.
Yes, Hindu dances, thank you, Sergeant. This is the first opportunity we've had of making an American author welcome.
Very popular, sir.
Very popular. Are you staying long?
...leaving tomorrow, sir.
Excuse me, have you got tooth...
Hello, Harry.
Well, well, they seem to've been giving you quite some busy time.
Well, well, they seem to've been giving you quite some busy time.
Listen...
Listen...
Yes.
Yes.
I want to talk to you.
I want to talk to you.
Talk to me?...Of course...Come on...
Listen, Harry - I didn't believe that...
It's good to see you, Holly.
Hmm.
She's been arrested.
She's been arrested.
Tough...tough...Don't worry, old man, they won't hurt her.
What can I do, old man, I'm dead, aren't I?
You can help her.
You can help her.
Holly...
...exactly who did you tell about me? Hmm?
I told the police.
Unwise, Holly...
And - Anna...
And - Anna...
Did the police believe you?
Did the police believe you?
You don't care anything at all about Anna, do you?
Well, I've got quite a lot on my mind.
You wouldn't do anything.
What do you want me to do?
You can get somebody else...
You can get somebody else...
Do you expect me to give myself up?
Do you expect me to give myself up?
Why not?
Why not?
It's far better thing that I do... Holly, you and I aren't heroes, the world doesn't make any heroes...
It's far better thing that I do... Holly, you and I aren't heroes, the world doesn't make any heroes...
You've got plenty of contacts.
You've got plenty of contacts.
Outside of your stories...I've got to be careful.
I'm only safe in the Russian Zone... I'm safe as long as they can use me...
As long as they can use you?
As long as they can use you?
I wish I could get rid of this thing.
You told them, didn't you?
Don't try to be a policeman, old man.
Don't try to be a policeman, old man.
What did you expect me to be - part of your...
Part? You can have any part you want, so long as you don't interfere...I have never cut you out of anything yet.
I remember when they raided the gambling joint - you know a safe way out...
I remember when they raided the gambling joint - you know a safe way out...
Sure...
Have you ever seen any of your victims?
Do you know, I don't ever feel comfortable on these sort of things...Victims?
...this way.
What do you want?
Mr. Martins. Delighted to meet you. Come let's sit down here. Ober! Zwei. What would you like. Tea? Coffee?
Coffee.
Coffee.
Zwei zwartze.
It's wonderful how you keep the tension.
Tension? KURTZ Suspense.
You really liked it?
At the end of every chapter --
We came out of his place like this, and were walking this way. A friend of his called to him from over there. Harry went across and from up there came the truck. It was just about here.
Here?
...were of you.
What did he say?
...you know and all that.
But he said he died instantaneously.
Well, there was only you, and this friend of his. Who is he?
A Roumanian.
...you.
Only his doctor, Dr. Winkel.
Not necessarily. She'd probably want to help.
What's the good of another post mortem? Suppose you dig up something - well - discreditable to Harry?
What's the good of another post mortem? Suppose you dig up something - well - discreditable to Harry?
Will you give me...
...your address?
I live in the Russian sector, but you'll find me at the Casanova Club every night. One has to work...
...the best way one can, you know.
What's the name of this girl?
Not yet.
But you will.
Mr. Popescu is here tonight.
The Roumanian?
The Roumanian?
Yes. The man who helped carry him.
Mr. Popescu - Mr. Martins.
How do you do.
Are you mad?
All right - I'm mad. I've seen a ghost...
Dr. Winkel?
Vinkel.
Vinkel.
Vinkel...You've got quite a collection of er-collection.

Coming to the point, please.

Thank you.
Thank you.
I have guests waiting.
Find out?
Hear the details.
Hear the details.
I can tell you very little. He was run over by a car. He was dead when I arrived.
Could he have been at all conscious?
I understand...
...he was. Yes, for a short time, while they carried him across the road.
In great pain?
In great pain?
Not necessarily.
Speak English?
English?
Already gone.
Who?
Coffin?
Mr. Lime's. Accident...
Baron Kurtz.
Must be some mistake.
Excuse me!
Yes, sir.
Did you know Mr. Lime well?
Mr. Lime - yes.
Mr. Lime - yes.
You remember me? Upstairs...

Yes, yes, I remember you.

What does he say?
Sehen sie da gleich da unter. Da unten ist est passiert. Passiert - English.
What's he saying?
Happened...Yes happened right down there.
You saw it?
You saw it?
Not saw, heard...heard. I heard the brakes. Wham! And I got to the window and saw them carry the body to the other side of the er...er Joseph...that's Joseph Emperor Joseph Statue.
Not saw, heard...heard. I heard the brakes. Wham! And I got to the window and saw them carry the body to the other side of the er...er Joseph...that's Joseph Emperor Joseph Statue.
Why didn't they bring him in the house?
Could he have been conscious?
Conscious? Cas soll ich auch noch wissen?
Conscious? Cas soll ich auch noch wissen?
Oh, er - oh...was he - was he still alive?
Oh, er - oh...was he - was he still alive?
Er, alive? He couldn't have been alive, not with his head in the way it was.
Er, alive? He couldn't have been alive, not with his head in the way it was.
I was told that he did not die at once.

...give evidence.
Who else?
Kurtz.
Yes.
Yes.
The Roumanian?
The Roumanian?
Yes.
Yes.
And?
There was a third man - he didn't give evidence.
You don't mean that doctor?
You don't mean that doctor?
No, no. He came late after they carried him to the Joseph Statue.
You gotta tell your story to the police.
Police? Why police? Das ist alles blodsum was sie da sangen. No, no. It is all nonsense; it was an accident.
Police? Why police? Das ist alles blodsum was sie da sangen. No, no. It is all nonsense; it was an accident.
You don't know it was an accident. You only saw a dead man and three men carry him.

Suppose I take...
Fer von mir aus gehen sie zur gansalt aber mich lassen sie aus mit der politzei.
Now, hold on.
Now, hold on.
Das hat man davon wenn man freundlich ist mit den auslandern...
I have no evidence. I saw nothing. I said nothing. It's not my business.
Well make it your business.
Yes, it is.
I am not a bad man.
Oh, you did.
Not the sort of thing I should confess to a total stranger, but you have to break the rules sometimes. Humanity's duty.
Harry...
Two double whiskeys. Was wunschen sie?
I thought there was something funny about the whole thing.
Funny?
Funny?
Something wrong.
Something wrong.
Of course there was. Some ice for Mr. Martins.
That's all you meant?
What else?
Wasn't he at the police inquiry?
He didn't want to get involved.
He didn't want to get involved.
Will we never teach these Austrians to be good citizens. It was his duty to give the evidence.
What else did he tell you?
That Harry was dead before you got him to that statue.
He probably knows a lot more than that. Somebody's lying.
Not necessarily.
No.
Joseph Harbin.
Joseph Harbin.
Joseph Harbin? No...no.
Third Man.
A novel, Mr. Martins?
Mr. Martins...
Not when I get interested.
...this time.
Yes.
Should I make it all fact?
Why no, Mr. Martins.
...Mr. Martins?
Never.
Passport, please.
Oh.
What's the purpose of your visit here?
A friend of mine offered me a job here.

His name?

Okay.

I thought he'd be here to meet me.
Excuse me.

Yeah; just ten or fifteen dollars maybe.
Yeah; just ten or fifteen dollars maybe.
I'm sorry, I don't think so.
I'm sorry, I don't think so.
I'm waiting on some money coming through. It's just that at the moment, you know, I'm short. They're going to chuck me out. On the street in Bangkok, that's bad.

Just five dollars, please.
I'll share something with you.

If you could see your way to lending me some cash -

Yeah, that's right. Now could you be quiet so I can get some sleep.
Yeah, that's right. Now could you be quiet so I can get some sleep.
Ten dollars. I'll find a way to pay you back. How would you like to know About somewhere special? The perfect beach. Paradise. No one else knows about it. That's got to be worth something. What do you say?
Ten dollars. I'll find a way to pay you back. How would you like to know About somewhere special? The perfect beach. Paradise. No one else knows about it. That's got to be worth something. What do you say?

Bonjour.
Good morning.
The noise? Don't worry. You're on holiday.
She means your neighbor. The Scotsman
She means your neighbor. The Scotsman
Oh, that noise! Yes, he certainly did.
Oh, that noise! Yes, he certainly did.
We moved rooms because of him.
It would be nice though, if there was a place like that. You know, that no one could get to.
Of course, but look; all these people. If that place existed, they'd all be there.
It's arranged. Tomorrow morning. Eight hundred bath.
Nice work.
Nice work.
There is one problem.
He will not take us to the island. It's in the National Park and it is forbidden to go there. But we are allowed to travel to this one to stay for one night.
That's the wrong one.
Yes, of course I can swim. How far do you think it is?
One or two kilometers.
One or two kilometers.
Oh. Great. Not far at all. I don't like to be negative, but do you think we should let someone know where we're going?
Oh. Great. Not far at all. I don't like to be negative, but do you think we should let someone know where we're going?
Why?
Why?
We're going to swim "one or two kilometers" across open sea, from one uninhabited island to another. Something goes wrong. What then?
Richard, it's secret. That's the whole point.
Yeah, OK. Forget it. We won't tell anyone.
I don't know - I'm American.
So?
So?
We think in miles, not kilometers.
We think in miles, not kilometers.
So how many miles do you think it is?
So how many miles do you think it is?
I have no idea but it looks like a long way.
Everyone ok?
We're ok.
We're ok.
I think we're about half way.
Richard - I saw a fin!
What!
What!
A fin!
A shark fin?
I don't know, just a fin. Over there. About a hundred meters.
I don't know, just a fin. Over there. About a hundred meters.
Big?

Yes.
Yes.
Well what the fuck do you expect me to do about it.
Well what the fuck do you expect me to do about it.
Nothing. I just thought you ought to know.
Nothing. I just thought you ought to know.
Well to be honest, Etienne, I would rather have not known about it.
Well to be honest, Etienne, I would rather have not known about it.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
A bit fucking late.
She is gone!
What happened?
She just went under the water. She was pulled under. Oh God, I don't see her.
Was there a shark? Did you see a shark?
What about Moliere?
Fuck off.
He tried to borrow money from us.
What idiot would lend him money? It would disappear.
What idiot would lend him money? It would disappear.
He said if we lent him money h would tell us about a secret beach.

It's on an island that no one get to.
It's on an island that no one get to.
But he has been there, off course.
But he has been there, off course.
It was ridiculous; all this at three o'clock in the morning.
We leave our rucksacks on this island and then we swim.
You can swim?
One kilometer
Two.
Two.
Richard?
Bonsoir.
Eh - bonsoir.
Did you sleep well?
Not too bad.
Not too bad.
I hope our noise did not keep you awake.
Hi.
Hi there. Here, take a look.
So from there to there?
We swim.
We swim.
Swim?
Have you told someone?
No.
No.
I think it's a bad idea to tell anyone.
Francoise -
Sshh. Etienne will be angry if I wake him. He thinks I waste film taking photographs of the sky.
I think so too.
One night I will get the perfect photograph.
You realize that in the eternity of space, there is a planet, just like this one, where you are photographing back towards us. You're photographing yourself.
Incredible.
Incredible.
There are infinite worlds out there, where anything that can happen does happen.

So on one you are rich, on another poor. On one you are a murderer, on another the victim.
So on one you are rich, on another poor. On one you are a murderer, on another the victim.
Exactly.
Exactly.
Richard, you know something -
That is just the kind of pretentious bullshit that Englishmen and Americans always say to French girls so that they can sleep with them.
Sorry. I thought I was doing quite well.
Sorry. I thought I was doing quite well.
It's just the sky, Richard.
Too far?
If it's too far, then we'll drown. But if we dont try then we'll never know.
We lost our key.
Where did you lose it?
Do you know the Kentucky friend mouse story?"
Woman bites chicken leg, turns out to be a mouse. Or a rat. It's an urban myth.
Woman bites chicken leg, turns out to be a mouse. Or a rat. It's an urban myth.
Exactly. Always happened to someone else.

So?

So there's an urban myth, well more of a rural myth, going around here at the moment. It's about a beach.
So there's an urban myth, well more of a rural myth, going around here at the moment. It's about a beach.
Uh-huh.
But, Danny, if HaShem is everything, and we are nothing how are we to judge His actions?
We have free will and intelligence -- which God allegedly gave us....
You think?! Based on what?
There's midrash supporting this. My father read a book by Shalom Spiegel that -- Isaac actually died and was reborn.
There's midrash supporting this. My father read a book by Shalom Spiegel that -- Isaac actually died and was reborn.
No one follows that midrash.
No one follows that midrash.
I do; I follow it. But okay, say God provided the ram. So what? Once Abraham raised the knife, in his heart it was as if he'd killed him. He could never forget that. And neither could Isaac. Look at him: he's traumatized, he's a putz for the rest of his life. By the end he can't tell Jacob from Esau....
Watch your language....
I think the whole Jewish people were permanently scarred by what happened on Mt. Moriah, and we still live in terror....
And you, if you had come out of Egypt, you would have been destroyed in the desert with those who worshipped the Golden Calf.
Then let Him destroy me now. Let Him crush me like the conceited bully He is. Go ahead. Kill me. Here I am. Do it!!
They only kill them when they love them?
What are you doing here, I thought you were a Nazi.
What's a fascist?
I rest my case. He's a Jewish Nazi. He always was.

Read the early Zionists on European Jewry; they sound like Goebbels.
They sound like you.

The Nazis did everything the führer told them. You do everything the Torah tells you. Or the rebbe. Identical slave mentality.
...So she takes the pants in back -- where they try them on? And I think fuck it....
Are you shitting me?? Right in the store?
Are you shitting me?? Right in the store?
She's been giving me the eye. She's hot. So I wait till the owner goes up front....
Fucking Danny, man...
He's an asshole.
Didn't you see <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>?
What??
What??
That was an ark, man. That was a Torah. They fucked around with it, and the Torah melted their faces.
That was an ark, man. That was a Torah. They fucked around with it, and the Torah melted their faces.

Who the fuck are you?
Who the fuck are you?
Who am I?? Who are you, you schmucks, you can't even make a decent swastika.... Give me the paint. Give it to me.
Bring your friends.... We're not his friends.
Then I won't bring you....
What, do you like it here?
Read <i>Mein Kampf</i>? Hitler had all his best ideas in prison.
You coming?
We'll go to the country sometime, okay?
Do we have to listen to this shit?
Yes.
Yes.
Why'd we have to leave so fast?
Oh, please...
Danny, it's true. There were no six million. At most, two hundred thousand Jews died in the camps. And the majority of them were from disease and --
Where did you read this? Robert Faurisson?
Yeah. He's a respected scholar. Even No-am Chomsky says he --
Yeah. He's a respected scholar. Even No-am Chomsky says he --
Billings, if Hitler didn't kill six million, why is he your hero?... Concentration camps all over Europe, and he only gets rid of a measly two hundred thousand.... He's a putz.
What do you care?
I don't, but...
I don't, but...
Let's look at the fucking thing.
It's called the flame alphabet. It's supposed to be the word of God written in fire.
Fire...
Fire...
The mystics tried to read the white spaces around the letters. They thought there was a whole alternative language hidden there, with secret, alternative meanings.
How come you know all this shit?
How come you don't know it? How can you say you hate the Jews when you don't know anything about --
How come you don't know it? How can you say you hate the Jews when you don't know anything about --
Fuck you. I hate the Jews at least as much as you do.
Fuck you. I hate the Jews at least as much as you do.
No, you don't.... If you hated them, you'd study them, so you'd know why you hate them. You know what tefillin is? Tsitsis? Shotness? You know the kaddish from the kiddush? Eichmann? He went to Israel. He studied the Torah, the Talmud, the Mishnah, the whole bit. He hated Jews.
Yeah, but not on the letters.
Why the fuck not?
Why the fuck not?
Just don't.
You write that? Come work for me. You've got a lot to learn; I can teach it to you.
I have a job.

Yeah, I read your piece. It's very smart. And very wrong.
Forget the Jewish stuff. It doesn't play anymore. There's only the market, now, and it doesn't care who you are.
People still need values, beliefs....
People still need values, beliefs....
No, they don't. Not the smart ones. Look, I'll give you five grand if you can document your tax-exempt status.... But when you fall off this horse, come see me. I can show you how to make a lot of money.
No, they don't. Not the smart ones. Look, I'll give you five grand if you can document your tax-exempt status.... But when you fall off this horse, come see me. I can show you how to make a lot of money.

See, the Jews love to separate things: the holy from the profane, milk from meat, wool from linen, the Sabbath from the week, the Jew from the gentile.... As if one little scrap of this was going to completely contaminate that.

We need intellectuals, we have enough thugs already.
More cultural than political.

No, but deep down, beneath the "tolerance" they learn on television, nothing's changed. The very word makes their skin crawl. It isn't even hate, really. It's more the way we feel when a rat runs across the floor. We want to step on it. Crush it. We don't even know why. It's a physical reaction. Everyone feels it.
You wouldn't announce it?

So, fine, it's not that the Jew, the Jews own the media and the banks. It's that they're sexually corrupt.
The Jews clearly control the media and the banks. Investment banks, not the commercial ones. But the point is they carry out in those realms the same principles they display in sexuality. They undermine traditional life; they deracinate society.
Deracinate... Tear out the roots. A people -- a real people -- derives its genius from the land: the sun, the sea, the soil. This is how they know themselves. But the Jew doesn't have soil.
He has Israel.

Notice the Israelis: a fundamentally secular society. They no longer need Judaism because they have soil. The real Jew is a wanderer, a nomad. He has no roots, no attachments. So he "universalizes" everything. He can't hammer a nail, plow a field. He can only buy and sell, invest capital, manipulate markets. He takes the life of a people rooted in soil and turns

He's going to die. He won't take his medicine. He eats dairy. He probably still smokes when I'm not around. I asked him to come live with us. Alex offered to share his room, unsolicited.... But he didn't want to be any trouble.
Then he couldn't be bitter about living alone.

The Nazi's killing his kid. He could've jumped the guy. He could've gouged his eyes out, grabbed the bayonet and gutted him.... What would you have done if they were killing your son?

I think anti-semitism today is largely a Jewish phenomenon. Wouldn't you agree?
In the Third Reich, weren't a number of high-ranking Nazis of Jewish origin?
Yes, and they were said to be the most virulent proponents of the Final Solution. Really, who but a Jew would want to kill Ilio Manzetti simply because he was Jewish? Who thinks about such things?

I was thinking of something kinda stupid last night. You know those women in the greek mythology that made love with the Gods. Take Leda for example, sleeping with Jupiter, who came to earth as a swan... Well, can you imagine Leda announcing to her swan "You're going to be a father, my little chick-a-dee"?
But your man isn't quite a God!

That's good. You never would have recognized me, huh? Check out the suit! Looking good, no? You know I'm the world champion?
Yes, I know.
Yes, I know.
I dove 315 feet!
I dove 315 feet!
Great!
Great!
They say I'm like Lazarus. You know, the guy who was raised from the dead?!
Why?
Because I'm sure you're dying to beat me.
Because I'm sure you're dying to beat me.
I don't want to be in any competition... I dive because I like to, not to beat a record... don't you have to be very mad at somebody to want to beat him?
I don't want to be in any competition... I dive because I like to, not to beat a record... don't you have to be very mad at somebody to want to beat him?
No. All you need is to want to be the best.
No. All you need is to want to be the best.
You're the best, Enzo!
You're the best, Enzo!
That's too easy! Every time I beat a record there's always some dumbshit asking me: "D'you know that French guy, Mayol? He's supposed to be very good! Too bad he doesn't compete." So, you're going to come with me to Taormina! First, because you're my friend and second, because you don't have one reason to keep on spoiling my pleasure. ... I'll see you
I remember. Hi Roberto!
What room have you got?
What room have you got?
I don't have one.
I don't have one.
You don't have a room? Paolo? What did I just hear? I personally called you to reserve a room for my good friend Jacques Mayol and you treat him like a stranger?!
You don't have a room? Paolo? What did I just hear? I personally called you to reserve a room for my good friend Jacques Mayol and you treat him like a stranger?!
It's okay, Enzo. I'll go somewhere else.
It's okay, Enzo. I'll go somewhere else.
Not only is Jacques Mayol a very special friend, but he happens to be one of the best divers in the world! And you're throwing him out! Are you crazy, or what? Stupido!
Not only is Jacques Mayol a very special friend, but he happens to be one of the best divers in the world! And you're throwing him out! Are you crazy, or what? Stupido!
Enzo drop it, I'll find something.
... So, after all these years, you must have lots of questions to ask. Am I right?
Yes, of course. Lots of questions.
Well, what are they?
I'm sorry... I don't know how to ask the questions.
That's good.
How do you make a living? Your experiments, does it pay well?
How do you make a living? Your experiments, does it pay well?
It's okay.
It's okay.
... You married?
No.
Me neither, 'cause of my Mother. She's a curse, my Mamma, a tornado. Stubborn as a mule! I was engaged... for a week. After that, Mamma was so mad, I tell you, pasta was bouncing off the walls.
So, not married. Well, good for you. You play the field, like me. A girl in every port, huh?
Exactly, I mean, after all, we're men!
Exactly, I mean, after all, we're men!
Damn right! That's what I tell them when people say you've turned into a fish.
Damn right! That's what I tell them when people say you've turned into a fish.
People say that?
People say that?
Forget it. I was joking.
No, no!
Not at all!
Not at all!
You're staying at the hotel?
Enzo?
What?
What?
Your mother?
Your mother?
Ahi, ahi, cazzo! Ma mamia! Where...? God, she'll kill me... ... if she catches me eating pasta in a restaurant.
Madame...
... And his friend, Johana...
C'mon, you two... Jacques, we have to get ready for the ceremony tonight. We have a new world champion.
I'm a little tired, I don't know if...
I'm a little tired, I don't know if...
Get in the car!
No.
Then, it's very chic. Avanti!
Why?
... For the mermaids.
Today at lunch, you asked me if I had any questions.
Ah ha. You finally want to know about women.
Ah ha. You finally want to know about women.
Why? Are they what's most important?
Why? Are they what's most important?
No... It depends... Sometimes they are... What, exactly do you want to know?
No... It depends... Sometimes they are... What, exactly do you want to know?
... Everything.
... Everything.
Everything about what?
Everything about what?
Well... about everything.
Why?
If we don't... I'm going to beat you.
Two years younger than you.
As I said, second of all you're too skinny. You've got tiny lungs. I still don't understand how you can dive without getting sick.
As I said, second of all you're too skinny. You've got tiny lungs. I still don't understand how you can dive without getting sick.
The size of the lungs has nothing to do with it!
The size of the lungs has nothing to do with it!
Look at me. These aren't lungs. These are... Tanks. How long can you hold your breath?
Tell me, why don't you go and get your medal?
Because pasta should be eaten "Al Dente". So the trinket will just have to wait a bit.
No, I have to ask you a favor... You're the only one who'll understand.
... I'm listening.
Hey! Will you slow down! When did you learn how to drive?
Driving isn't the problem, it's remembering the right road.
Good night.
You don't need a stretcher to take her with you. You know that, don't you?
You don't need a stretcher to take her with you. You know that, don't you?
What?
What?
The dolphins aren't the only ones who don't feel very good sometimes.
Here... Here...
What is it?
What is it?
Little presents, nothing much... I knew it, I just knew it! Look here!
You still collect them?
Yes.
Yes.
You don't have that one, do you?
You don't have that one, do you?
No. Thank you. It's really beautiful.
No. Thank you. It's really beautiful.
Oh it's nothing. I knew it. I told Roberto "He's very good that little Frenchman, very good". I lost my title but I won a watch!
Can I come in?
No problem, I enjoy talking in my sleep.
He doesn't like us.
So what!? His job is to hand out the paychecks. And he does that very well, let me tell you.
... I was seventeen, I loved her so much I tried to die for her. Two years later I couldn't even remember her name! Let me tell you, time erases everything!
I don't want to erase anything.
I don't want to erase anything.
You'd rather think about it and make yourself miserable?
You'd rather think about it and make yourself miserable?
... Yes.
... Yes.
I give you this. You're stubborn... Dumb, but stubborn.
I give you this. You're stubborn... Dumb, but stubborn.
Thank you.
Anybody can have a bad day!
I've had many... when the sea doesn't want you.
I've had many... when the sea doesn't want you.
It's never the sea! It's Roberto, Mamma, that stupid actress... Oh shit! Jacques, what do you know?
Enzo, Enzo! Congratulations!
Thank you, thank you very much!
That's good.
Enzo, don't be angry. I was lucky... that's all.
... How long was I asleep?
Long enough to die. Listen, if you really want to die, that's your problem, but don't do it under my nose, okay?
I'm concentrating.
We can't dive anymore. They want to cancel the competition for a while.
It's not safe, they say. The doctors say it isn't possible to go deeper and live. Free diving is over as a sport.
You say that because you have the title!
You say that because you have the title!
No! I would never cheat you.
No! I would never cheat you.
Well that's very nice of you.
You were right.
... I was right about what?
... I was right about what?
... It is much better down there. It's a better place.
... Push me back in the water...
I can't.
I can't.
Jacques, take me back down... Please.
Don't you have a heater?
Yeah... Sure... Is this your first trip to Peru?
Yeah... Sure... Is this your first trip to Peru?
Does anybody live to make a second?
A drink to warm up?
Yes, thank you. Intravenous if possible.
Yes, thank you. Intravenous if possible.
Tea... or whiskey?
Tea... or whiskey?
... both. Did I just see a man in a red suit and goggles?
Would it be out of place to ask what he's doing?
Who?
Who?
The guy in the Halloween suit!
I recognize you.
We saw each other a little while ago.
We saw each other a little while ago.
In the lake?
In the lake?
No... in the hut.
Please, have a seat.
Thank you. I wouldn't want to interrupt anything.
But what brought you to Sicily?
I was doing an insurance investigation in Palermo. I work for an insurance company. So, I decided to take a few days off. I don't know this island at all. It really is gorgeous.
No, no. You'll like it. It's superb.
... Okay. I'll try.
Thanks for helping with the bag. It looks great!
I thought it was a nice place. Isn't it?
I thought it was a nice place. Isn't it?
I'm being a pain in the ass. It's beautiful here.
You're going to be very busy these days aren't you?
I don't know... why?
I don't know... why?
Just because... I would have liked to visit the town... See the coast... I don't know anybody... Expect for you.
Yes... Maybe... I don't know. I don't like competitions... It ruins the fun. Don't you think?
I guess... But you know... I'm American and I've mostly been taught to be competitive... There's always pleasure of being the best?
I guess... But you know... I'm American and I've mostly been taught to be competitive... There's always pleasure of being the best?
Maybe on earth there is one... but not when you dive... You see, to dive deep into the sea, for no reason... just to do it. It's a feeling... I don't know how to say this... Voluptuous?
I thought you'd be at the dinner.
It's too loud for me.
You look adorable.
Thank you...
Thank you...
... Especially the sneakers.
Please move slowly, you're rocking the boat.
Lucky I was there to save you.
Lucky I was there to save you.
You jumped in?
You jumped in?
Only to help the medics, I assure you.
Only to help the medics, I assure you.
My wallet.
No. I want to show you. Is it ruined?
Well, water isn't exactly the best thing for pictures... Not even for pictures of dolphins...
Well, water isn't exactly the best thing for pictures... Not even for pictures of dolphins...
Give it to me.
Just checking up on your family. I guess I was drunker than I thought and the idea of going back to my hotel in a wet dress... Well...
I'm glad you stayed. Thank you.
I'm glad you stayed. Thank you.
I'd better get back now.
I'd better get back now.
You... You wouldn't want to spend the day with me?
... No?
No? Huh? Yes, of course!!
How can you tell it's a female?
... The way she moves.
She's not like the others. She can't stand to be away from the sea.
How do you know that?
How do you know that?
I don't know, I just feel it.
Can I come watch you dive tomorrow?
Uh... Yes, of course!
Jacques, you set a world record.
I did?
I did?
Aren't you happy? Don't you feel proud...? I feel proud and all I did was watch.
I'm going back home.
Why?
Why?
Because one shouldn't fall in love with creatures from the sea.
Because one shouldn't fall in love with creatures from the sea.
I'm not from the sea... I don't understand what you're talking about.
I'm not from the sea... I don't understand what you're talking about.
Yes you do. You know exactly what I'm talking about. You're afraid I want to hold onto you, and I do, but you're not ready... at least not for me.
Yes you do. You know exactly what I'm talking about. You're afraid I want to hold onto you, and I do, but you're not ready... at least not for me.
But it's not true, I feel good with you... It feels right...
Hello?
It's me... Johana.
How are you?
I got fired.
I got fired.
... That's funny... I had this job with Enzo... we got fired too.
So have I. ... Hello?
I'm still here.
I'm still here.
Well, then, talk to me some more.
Well, then, talk to me some more.
... It's hard you know. You're so far away and I don't know what else to say.
... It's hard you know. You're so far away and I don't know what else to say.
Then, tell me a story.
Then, tell me a story.
Uh... Ah! A story?
Do you know how it is? Do you know what you're supposed to do to meet a mermaid?
No... tell me.
No... tell me.
You go down to the bottom of the sea, where the water isn't even blue anymore, where the sky is only a memory... and you float there, quietly, quietly and stay there... and you decide that you will die for them... Only then do they start coming out. They come and greet you and they judge the love you have for them... If it's
Hello?
It's me again.
I'm being a pain, huh?
... Not at all.
... Not at all.
You sure?
You sure?
Absolutely positive.
Absolutely positive.
Okay. In that case... I'm at the airport in Nice.
Why did you take me to the hotel, if you live here.
You'll understand.
Bonjour Monsieur... Louis.
Uncle Louis. He's a 75 year old amazing guy, isn't he?
Uncle Louis. He's a 75 year old amazing guy, isn't he?
I'm very pleased to meet you, Uncle Louis.
And you?
I didn't dive.
I didn't dive.
You'll try again tomorrow?
You'll try again tomorrow?
I don't know... it didn't feel right. I'm going to bed. I'm tired.
What?
... Nothing.
What are you doing?
I'm putting you on the coin... Your essence... That way you'll always be with me when I dive.
Jacques...?
You go back, I'll walk.
What's wrong?
It's nothing. Just the long trip. I'm a little jet-lagged.
It's nothing. Just the long trip. I'm a little jet-lagged.
You want to lie down for a while?
You want to lie down for a while?
No, I'll be fine. Can you just hand me a glass of water?
... When you dive... with that machine... What does it feel like?
... The feeling of slipping without falling... The hardest is once you are at the bottom.
... The feeling of slipping without falling... The hardest is once you are at the bottom.
Why?
Why?
Because you have to find a good reason to come back up again... And I always have a hard time finding one.
You've got to tell me what happened?
I saw how it has to be.
Jacques? I'm pregnant.
That's good... that's wonderful. It's wonderful for you.
That's good... that's wonderful. It's wonderful for you.
You are the father.
Promise me one thing.
Anything.
Anything.
Promise you won't forget me.
Mayol... Mayol... No reservation.
... Are you sure?
... Are you sure?
Positive, Sir.
This is the hotel San Domenico?
Yes Sir, and it has been so for 127 years.
Yes Sir, and it has been so for 127 years.
Yes, but... So, you haven't got a room left?
Yes, but... So, you haven't got a room left?
No Sir, the hotel is full because of the Diving championship.
No Sir, the hotel is full because of the Diving championship.
Ah?!
You shouldn't dive everyday, Papa.
Then you shouldn't eat everyday, Jacques.
Hey! Have you ever seen a mermaid?
No.
Why don't you ask me?
What?
What?
Where I saw the mermaids?! Why don't you ever ask any question? I'm always the one asking the question! We're sitting here like two stones and I'm taking to myself. Ask me something, Goddamnit!
Assassin!
Uncle Louis, this is my friend Johana.
Uncle Louis, this is my friend Johana.
Did you buy the cassettes? The Wagner, the Berlioz?

I brought Johana to meet you.

Are you crazy? I have no use for a woman! Since my accident.
Are you crazy? I have no use for a woman! Since my accident.
No, no. Johana is visiting me.
Where are you from, Henrietta?
Johana... New York.
Johana... New York.
What kind of name is that? To be named after a city?
What kind of name is that? To be named after a city?
He doesn't hear too well.
Uncle Louis!
No, no. It's true. When I was in New York, oh boy! Before my accident, you understand?
Good. That way I'll see more of you... Where are you going to stay?
Well... here.
Well... here.
In my apartment?
In my apartment?
It's my apartment.

Uncle Louis, we have a guest!
Uncle Louis, we have a guest!
I'm going to put a lock on the telephone. Did you bring the cassettes?
Uncle Louis, you remember Enzo's mother Signora Molinari from Amorgos?
The whale! How could I forget? Always was something fishy about that woman!
What were Italians doing living in Greece anyway?
Louis, we were French!
Louis, we were French!
That's different! What's the matter with you?
I changed the lock you son of a bitch!
... Sally?
You're back! Hello. We were burgled.
Again?
Again?
They got the new T.V.
... And the new stereo.
I hope they remembered to take the microwave this time?

Yep. How was your trip...? Help me clean up, okay?

You called the police?

They're going to send detectives.
Well?
What?
What?
How was your trip?
How was your trip?
Nice... Very interesting... Great! ... I guess.
Nice... Very interesting... Great! ... I guess.
Okay... Who'd you meet?
It's his heartbeat.
Oh Jesus...! I'll make some coffee. They left the stove.
I thought you said he was Peruvian?
Haven't you been listening?
... Since eight o'clock last night...! You're in love.
Don't be a jerk. There's no such thing as love at first sight.
... And if we repaint the walls, we'll need new curtains, you put the painters on you Visa and I'll do the curtains on American Express... for the couch there's Bloomingdales... or are you still over your limit?
Way past it.
Way past it.
Does that have a hidden meaning?
Does that have a hidden meaning?
No. I'm just depressed.
No. I'm just depressed.
You look it too. You haven't been working out, you haven't been taking your vitamins! You haven't been drinking your herbs, you haven't been...
You look it too. You haven't been working out, you haven't been taking your vitamins! You haven't been drinking your herbs, you haven't been...

What is it honey... the frenchy?
What is it honey... the frenchy?
Do you think I should have stayed? Don't you think maybe I should have stayed? I've been a jerk, right? I should have stayed! I was supposed to be in love... I was in love! I am in love, why did I act like a bitch? He went swimming. All the man did was go swimming! I must be crazy. It was too good

Vitamins, exercise, herb tea... and see a doctor, will ya?
What are they for?
They're paramedics. They wait at 180 feet.
They're paramedics. They wait at 180 feet.
If there was a problem, they could do something right?
If there was a problem, they could do something right?
Of course, that's what they're for.
... And those?
Those are the divers who go down 300 to 330 feet. They dive with a Helium-oxygen mixture. At that depth, compressed air is too dangerous because it contains carbon dioxide.

What's that little air bottle on the machine?
What's that little air bottle on the machine?
That isn't for the divers actually. It's for the balloon. It blows up and pulls the diver up like an elevator. Without it, with the pressure at the bottom, the diver would just stay pinned to the sea bed.

But doesn't Jacques dive without anything?
But doesn't Jacques dive without anything?
Yes... It's magic.
Who... Who is that?
Mayol... Jacques Mayol.
Mayol... Jacques Mayol.
That's the experiment? Dumping a guy into a frozen lake?
... The truck fell into a very deep crevasse. We weren't able to save the equipment.
I'll have to talk to the driver.
I'll have to talk to the driver.
In the spring when he melts!
My dear, science is a cruel mistress.
But... how is he going to breathe?
But... how is he going to breathe?
He isn't going to breathe.
He's in the fluoroscope now. Listen to his heart. Impressive, huh? The flow of blood is concentrated in the brain and doesn't even feed the limbs anymore. It's a phenomena that has only been observed with dolphins... until now.
How long can he stay down? Without breathing?
How long can he stay down? Without breathing?
It depends. He should come up soon. Unless he's decided to stay for the night.
It depends. He should come up soon. Unless he's decided to stay for the night.
Why is he doing this?
Why is he doing this?
For one thing, it's his job... as for the rest of it, I wish I knew.
Shouldn't somebody take him a blanket or something?
Coffee might be nice.
Will he understand Spanish?
His mother's an American. He spent half of his life in the states. I'd try English if I were you.
Okay, listen, just get the custom's office to send me a copy as fast as possible. We can't send you new equipment until our file is complete. Okay?
Okay, okay. You'll have it by the end of the week, how's that?
Okay, okay. You'll have it by the end of the week, how's that?
You've made me a happy insurance person.
You've made me a happy insurance person.
Then, goodbye.
Wait! Professor...?
... Yes?
I'll go see how he's doing.
Let him sleep.
Alright Mordechai, now that we're alone I just want to say that I'm not happy about this. I don't want a repeat of that incident in the West Bank.
I got the job done didn't I? I did what I had to do.
I got the job done didn't I? I did what I had to do.
A settlement completely demolished, ten smashed army jeeps, four dead Arabs. G dash D damn it, Hammer! You think you're above the Ten Commandments? Just find Santa Claus and bring him back to us. No heroics, got it?
A settlement completely demolished, ten smashed army jeeps, four dead Arabs. G dash D damn it, Hammer! You think you're above the Ten Commandments? Just find Santa Claus and bring him back to us. No heroics, got it?
Hey, it's your Bar Mitzvah. I'm just readin' the Torah portion.
I guess I could be chalant about it, but then again I'm not even sure if that's a word. Listen Chief, we could stand around arguing all day, but I gotta case to crack.
What's your first move?
What's your first move?
I'm gonna pay a visit to the K.L.F. See if they've got the 411 on Santa's location. I'll check in with you when I know more.
Chief, it's me. Listen carefully. I need for the Worldwide Jewish Media Conspiracy to mass produce video copies of every Hollywood movie ever made featuring a positive Jewish protagonist as its lead.
You mean you want us to make copies of Yentl, Fiddler On The Roof, and Chaim Potok's The Chosen?
You mean you want us to make copies of Yentl, Fiddler On The Roof, and Chaim Potok's The Chosen?
That'll work. Get them out to the Jewish community stat. We got an epidemic on our hands.
It was a trap. I'm back at square one.
Well, then I've got good news for you. We just got word that he'll be making an appearance at the Mall Of America today. I'm sending Esther to meet you there at once.

Good thinking. We'll disguise ourselves as a Gentile couple to pass undetected. Now that he thinks I'm dead, this should be a piece of homentashen.

One last thing Hammer. You take care of yourself. The...
Mordechai. Thank god you're here.
What's up?
What's up?
About an hour ago, we received this transmission from the North Pole.
Looks like I got a plane to catch.
Take Esther with you, you'll need the backup.
Take Esther with you, you'll need the backup.
No way, it's too dangerous. Besides, my days of hooking are over.
So why the long face?
It's Esther. Santa's got her.
It's Esther. Santa's got her.
My Esther! Oh Mordechai.
Please. Will you help me?
I love her sir. If I don't help you, I won't be able to make her my wife. Mohammed Ali Paula Abdul Rahim has agreed to come with me to the North Pole on a rescue mission.
There won't be any need for that sir.
Hammer, the fate of my daughter rests solely in your hands.
Hammer, the fate of my daughter rests solely in your hands.
I know sir. I won't let you down.
So. Do you have a name?
It's Esther.
It's Esther.
From the story of Purim. Well, now that we're all acquainted, let's sit down and start the Sabbath.
You like my Mordechai, yes?
He's...he's very nice. But Mrs. Carver, the fate of Hanukkah rests solely in his hands. Please, you have to help me.
Hanukkah, Shmanukkah. It isn't even one of the high holidays. What concerns me more is that my boychick is almost thirty, and has yet to settle down with a nice Jewish girl. I'll make you a deal. I'll help you with your little Hanukkah problem if you help me with my Mordechai.
What do you want me to do?
What do you want me to do?
He works too much. God forbid he should have a nice Jewish girl come eat by him once in a while. Take his mind off his work. Maybe a blowjob here and there.
Well, for starters, we're going to honeymoon in Boca for a week. And then, when we get back, Morty's been talking about taking a stable, good paying job as a consultant for the JDL.
Well, I couldn't be happier for the both of you.
Mr. Jefferson Carver?
Please, call me Mordechai.
Please, call me Mordechai.

Actually, his days of marital infidelity have long since past. Now he just shtoops my mother exclusively.
Your mother? Oh. Whoops.
Mordechai, Santa Claus has been rubbed out by his son Damian. The man's a demon. There's no telling what this new anti semitic psycho Santa is capable of.

I'm sorry to hear about Santa. He was a good friend, but my days...
Oy vey, I'm stuffed.
I don't think I could eat another latke if you paid me.
Any sign of Santa?
He must be behind that curtain. Relax. We're undercover. We need to give off the appearance of calm. You see Esther, the trick to undercover work is to try and blend in. Act as a Gentile would.
What are we going to do? We're at least an hour from the front.
C'mon follow me.
That got annoying fairly quickly.
Yeah, no kidding.
So, now what?
Now we wait for Santa to make his next move.
Want to get a drink?
Sure. Why not.
What was that!?
I said, do you come here often!?
What!?
I said, yeah, about once a week!
I said, yeah, about once a week!
Oh!
Sorry. I'm better with men.
Maybe we should try a different kind of dancing.
Maybe we should try a different kind of dancing.
You mean like disco dancing or doing the funky chicke...Oh. I get it.
Mordechai?
Yes Esther.
Yes Esther.
I want you to talk dirty to me.
I want you to talk dirty to me.
Oh. Okay.
I want for our children to go to private schools and take music lessons. Little Abraham will go to Stanford for college, Batya will go Ivy League, maybe Vassar.
Keep going.
Keep going.
Afterwards they'll make the decision as to whether or not they'd like to continue their religious studies in Israel. Because, hey, after all we'll have practiced the highly effective assertive democratic style of child rearing, sprinkled with a healthy dose of liberalism.
Also, on a daily basis, I want you to tell me what to do, where to do it, and how I should live my life.
Kiss me you Semitic stud!
Your mother was right. You do work too hard.
Oh, she said that, did she? What else did Mommy Dearest have to say?
When did you guys have this conversation? When I was in the bathroom? What else did she have to say?
Relax Morty, I think your mom is wonderful. She cares so much about you. Get this, while you were gone she said she'd help me get you to work with the JDL if I'd come eat by you once in awhile. Like I needed any incentive to be with you. She's so...
Oh my god. She's become my pimp. And she's whoring her bitch-son out to the highest bidder.
No. It's not like that. You're being completely neurotic. I was just playing along...
We do!
I'm sorry Esther, I just don't think we can see each other romantically anymore.
What are you doing here?
Mordechai, I love you. I couldn't let you do this alone.
Mordechai, I love you. I couldn't let you do this alone.
I love you too. I'm sorry about freaking out yesterday. I was wrong.
I love you too. I'm sorry about freaking out yesterday. I was wrong.
I forgive you.
Esther!
Mordechai!
Esther!
Mordechai!
You two know each other?
We go to the same temple.
Shabat Shalom mama. I brought some Manischewitz. The black label.
I can see. And you also brought a nice girl to come eat by us.
Mordechai. Do you love your mother?
Mom, stop with this already. Of course I love you. You're my mother.
Mom, I have a real job. I do good things for this community. I help people.
When I play bridge with all the girls, everyone has what to talk about with their sons. They show pictures. Their sons are lawyers and doctors and Rabbis. Why can't I show a picture?
When I play bridge with all the girls, everyone has what to talk about with their sons. They show pictures. Their sons are lawyers and doctors and Rabbis. Why can't I show a picture?
So don't show a picture.
So don't show a picture.
You know my friend Maureen? Her son, the investment banker? He paid for her entire retirement in Boca Raton. What a mench he is. Instead of schleping to save Hanukkah, god forbid you should go back to business school and get an MBA. Maybe then you could send me to Boca, too.
I don't want to argue with you. Let's just eat in peace.
No. No. We're gonna argue. And you know what mom? I'm going to save Hanukkah just to spite you. And when my face is all over the television. When your friends are opening their Hanukkah gifts next year, don't mention it to them, okay? I wouldn't want you to have to show my picture.
No. No. We're gonna argue. And you know what mom? I'm going to save Hanukkah just to spite you. And when my face is all over the television. When your friends are opening their Hanukkah gifts next year, don't mention it to them, okay? I wouldn't want you to have to show my picture.
Do what you must.
Let's let your tuchus breathe.
Mom, why don't you put that cat out of its misery?
...and the opportunity to help my brothers and sisters in the Jewish community.
Well I'm just glad you're safe Bubba Shaina, and eating by your mother for Shabos.
...and their children will all be able to eat latkes and spin dreidels, and light the menorah with the knowl...
...So you saved Hanukkah Mr. Big Shot. I mean, let's be honest Mordechai, it isn't even one of the high holidays.
Well I have news for you mom. It is good enough...I'm good enough and I won't leave here until I hear you tell me...
Mazel Tov!
Hello Mazel Tov! A boojee boojee boojee boo...
...I'm not finished yet, mom.
Mom! We're eating!
What a good poop you made in your diaper Mazel Tov! That's right! Mommy loves you! Such a good boy you are!
Happy Hanukkah Tikva.
Happy Hanukkah Morty.
Okay, what's the information?
She said to remind you that you're having Shabat dinner by her tomorrow and also to remind you to bring the Manischewitz.
Anything else?
Yeah, I'm going to be out of the office from 1:30 to 3:00 on Sunday. I have a terrible yeast infection and I need to see my gynecologist.
But we're not open on Sundays.
I understand that. I just thought that you might want to know.
I understand that. I just thought that you might want to know.
I'll be in my office.
So Morde-chai, tell me, what brings your bad self down to the KLF?
I'm back on the job for the JDL. You hear about that crazy white boy who took over as Santa?
I'm back on the job for the JDL. You hear about that crazy white boy who took over as Santa?
Oh, most definitely. Got the brothers here in full alert mode.
Actually, I...I don't. What does that mean?
Oh. It means that Santa's gonna fuck Hanukkah's shit up.
Oh. It means that Santa's gonna fuck Hanukkah's shit up.
Not if I can help it. You got any information for me?
You watch your back Hammer. Hanukkah might just be his first move. For all we know Kwanzaa could be next. There's a lot of brothers counting on you. If you fail...
Okay, look. I'm going to work really, really hard on this one. But, please stop with the pressure. I'm already tense as it is.
Okay, look. I'm going to work really, really hard on this one. But, please stop with the pressure. I'm already tense as it is.
It's cool. It's cool. Aveenooh Shalom Alechem, brother.
What's wrong with him?
He's still working out some identity issues.
It's gonna be tough, but the back entrance looks like our best bet.
I wanted to ask you, how were you able to pinpoint the exact location of Santa's workshop? We've been trying to gain that piece of surveillance for years.
Cool. What's it do?
Now this might get a bit technical, but try and stay with me. Using a highly sophisticated connection of other computators, called the Internet, I can access surveillance maps, villian biographical information, and even sports scores with a few simple keystrokes of this electronic typewriter.
Man, that's far out! Hey, the Jets won!
But wait, there's more. With a few swift clicks of this hand-computer interface, commonly referred to as a mouse, I can download illicit pornographic material and even send it along to a friend via a cyber postal route known as e-mail.
Porno? You're tellin' me that you can get porno on that thing?
Oh yeah. Take a look.
What are you doing?
Just praying to god that we don't kill ourselves going over this wall.
Wait! Before we enter, you need to know that my research has determined that Santa's compound is wired with the XP 2000 stereo type alarm system.
A stereo type alarm system?
A stereo type alarm system?
Take a look.
How do we bypass it?
The alarm will trigger if the system detects any Non-W.A.S.P. tendencies inside the building. For example, if you were to dribble a basketball, or eat watermelon, or use the word dawg...that is, spelled with an aw as opposed to the letter o...within the confines of this workshop, the alarm would sound.
Listen cat, I'll have you know that I hate the taste of watermelon and am a terrible basketball player.
Well that's good news for us. It means the system is outdated. This should be easy. C'mon.
What are you doing?
Offscreen gunfire. That Jewish Atomic Clock stuff ate up a lot of our budget.
Hammer, you alright?
Everything's kosher. Watch him for me.
Sorry folks, I don't do couples.
If you keep your mouth shut and come with me, you won't get hurt.
If you keep your mouth shut and come with me, you won't get hurt.
Excuse me? Do I know you, friend? Take a look around you. Do you even know who I am?
Let me guess, you're the goy who stole Hanukkah.
The Hebrew Hammer! You're alive.
What's your shpiel, Santa?
Whoa, whoa there. C'mon Mordechai, is this any way to treat an old family friend? Let's cut out all the unpleasantness. I admit, I went way overboard with the whole Hanukkah thing. Let me make it up to you. How about a peace offering? Girls.
What are you doing?
I'm just calming the kiddies. There's no need to worry about Santa. He's just having a peaceful, adult conversation with his nice Jewish friend, The Hebrew Hammer.
Hey everybody. How's it hangin'?
In fact, he's just informed me that he personally plans on cancelling Christmas this year.
Where's my girlfriend Santa?
I don't have to tell you anything Hammer! You're gonna have to kill me before I tell you!
I shlepped all the way to the North Pole for this? I come to fight you, and you don't even put out anything to nosh on? What kind of arch nemesis are you?
Hah! Jewish guilt. Well, it won't work on me Hammer. I'm too strong for it.
So, what's our first plan of attack Santa?
While I was in Taiwan negotiating the solution to our labor problems, I came across a factory that illegally manufactures the most addictive, Jewish pride weakening substance on the planet. I bought the entire plant.
What should I charge?
Oh, that's the beauty of it. These are free samples.
So what's in the boxes? Heroin? Cocaine?
Worse.
Bootleg copies of the Frank Capra classic, 'It's A Wonderful Life.'
That's some cold shit.
So, how was I?
It was good. Very chilling, but you still got all the points across that we talked about.
I wasn't too over the top?
No, it was the perfect level.
No, it was the perfect level.
Thanks. Oh, did I tell you. I picked up that new KC and the Sunshine Band record that you recommended. You were right, it is good.
You okay?
No. I'm airsick you asshole! Where the hell did these reindeer learn to fly?
No. I'm airsick you asshole! Where the hell did these reindeer learn to fly?
I don't know. Why don't you ask them sir.
Get off of me you cripple!
What are we gonna do? He's got us on the ropes.
What's going on? Why'd he stop?
Maybe he ran out of ammo.
Maybe he ran out of ammo.
Take a look.
Well, he's kinda just resting in the corner with his girlfriend.
Resting?
What day is it?
It's Friday.
You want me to be nice to him for no apparent reason whatsoever, buy him clothing he'll never wear, and for just one day of the year pretend to forgive him for all the horrible things he did to me as a young boy when my mommy wasn't looking?
No dipshit, I want you to kill him.
Is someone with you -- can I get you a drink?
Why not?
My soninlaw. What do you think of him?
That depends. How much money has he?
When you marry champagne, Clo-Clo, you can't trade it in for beer. You're stuck with it.
I can't understand that fancy talk. You mean I'm a gold-digger? Sure, I'm a gold-digger -- why not?
I can't understand that fancy talk. You mean I'm a gold-digger? Sure, I'm a gold-digger -- why not?
Why not -- if you like it - if that's what you really want.
Maybe I should just forget all about money - - forget about mamma and the kids and the rent, huh - marry some poor dope like -- oh, like Carlos Dominguez - - and get fat and -
Who's Carlos Dom-what's-his-name?
Nobody. A boy who works in a grocery.
Good looking?
Good looking?
Mmmyes.
Mmmyes.
Nice fellow?
Is he in love with you?
I don't know -
Why do you ask so many questions? What difference does it make how Carlos and I feel? Feeling does not buy clothes and houses!
Drink your beer and don't get so excited.
This is for "mama and the kids."
What about me?
What about me?
You get your money from your husband.
Here is something that should interest Charlie - a stone leopard head made by his ancestors some six hundred years ago. They used it in ceremonies. The jaguar -- in fact all the cat family -- were considered the personification of force and violence in their religious rites.
It don't look like a leopard to me.
Well, Charlie, just why do you think your cat didn't kill the Contreras girl?
You know -- not scared enough. Nothing to scare it.
You know -- not scared enough. Nothing to scare it.
If a leopard didn't do it, who did?
Oh, I'm only exploring your theory. Let's take a step further. You drink, don't you, Charlie?
I drink.
I drink.
And when you drink, you get drunk.
Then what do you do?
I sleep it off.
I sleep it off.
But between the time you leave the cant ma and fall into bed in that old truck of yours, what happens, Charlie?
But between the time you leave the cant ma and fall into bed in that old truck of yours, what happens, Charlie?
I don't know.
I don't know.
That's just it, Charlie. That's what I'm driving at. You could do anything in that time.
Now I know I didn't hurt nobody when I was drunk - -
Of course, not, Charlie. I never thought you did.
Of course, not, Charlie. I never thought you did.
And my leopard - - maybe he hurt the first girl -- but no more.
Can't make a buck without my leopard. I tell you, Mr. Manning, you gotta find that cat for me -- or pay up.
Look, Charlie, just be patient. I'll fix everything. You don't want that cat, anyway. It killed two people.
Look, Charlie, just be patient. I'll fix everything. You don't want that cat, anyway. It killed two people.
No, sir. That girl in the cemetery? My cat didn't kill that girl. I told you cats don't go around looking for trouble. If that cat's alive, it's out in the country hiding under a bush, starving to death.
No, sir. That girl in the cemetery? My cat didn't kill that girl. I told you cats don't go around looking for trouble. If that cat's alive, it's out in the country hiding under a bush, starving to death.
You really think so, Charlie?
You really think so, Charlie?
That cat ain't mean. I feed him out of my own hand for six years. Why don't he kill me? At night in the truck, I let him out of the cage. When I am falling asleep I hear him walking back and forth. I go to sleep. He don't hurt me.

They all say the cat killed this second girl.
They all say the cat killed this second girl.
They don't say it to me.

I'd like one of them to say it to you, Charlie. I'd like to have you hear his side of it his reasons. Want to hear them?
I'd like one of them to say it to you, Charlie. I'd like to have you hear his side of it his reasons. Want to hear them?
Sure.
Sure.
Let's get in your truck.
Where's that man?
Up at the museum.
Sure, I like my leopards
But he admitted quick enough that it killed the first girl.
Sure!
No. I'm serious about this.
Charlie wasn't drunk last night.
Yes, I was drunk, Mr. Manning.
I'm sick.
Here have a cigarette. He was only kidding.
Here have a cigarette. He was only kidding.
No, he wasn't kidding. I'm sick. Claw women? Hurt little girls? No!
I don't know. I want to see Robles.
What do you want to see him for?

I want him to lock me up.
I want him to lock me up.
Look, Charlie, you didn't do it, and you know you didn't.
Look, Charlie, you didn't do it, and you know you didn't.

Two hundred and fifty dollars you owe met
You found the leopard!
What's left of him.
Where? Where did you find it?
North -- in an arroyo, Shot through the head - maybe week ago. No good, skin, everything gone 
What arroyo - how did you get to it 
And here is Three Tree Mesa -- and here I go out of the big arroyo --
That's the place: I remember - My feet were so darn sore, I couldn't make it -- and Galbraith went on up to the head of the canyon by himself --
It's a blackcard and bad card, but not the card of the cat - not the card of fourfooted things.
I saw Teresa. Maybe I was the last to see her except perhaps her Mamacita and her little brother. I was going past --
I saw Teresa. Maybe I was the last to see her except perhaps her Mamacita and her little brother. I was going past --

They're fools. Why don't they let Charlie How-Come hunt it alone. He's an Indian.
They're fools. Why don't they let Charlie How-Come hunt it alone. He's an Indian.
All men are fools. They like to make a big show - shout and hunt --
What did they say before the bad card came up?
You'll meet a rich man and he will give, you money.
You'll meet a rich man and he will give, you money.
You and your cards. Meet a rich man! I look for them with money. What rich man hasn't money. And for what was I born if it wasn't for money? You're not telling me anything.
You and your cards. Meet a rich man! I look for them with money. What rich man hasn't money. And for what was I born if it wasn't for money? You're not telling me anything.
Watch and see, A day or a week - but certainly this month -- you will have money from a man and then-
Well -- did he give you a lot of money?
Who?
Who?
The elderly man I told you about.
Cut.
What are you doing that for?
Something black - something on its way to you 
Go on -
Don't look at it!
Let me see it 
The death card - -
Maybe not - cards mean different things different times --
See you tomorrow -
Tomorrow -
He will be waiting...
You must say that you went to take some of the roses to your father's grave...

At four. He will be there at four.
Pedro is waiting for me, too.

What, senorita?

When you are going to see Pedro, does your heart beat until you tremble?
Love is different for different people.
I suppose so. I suppose it will be different for us, too  when everyone knows. Then we will be just like other people. But these last weeks will always be our secret  a lovely secret to remember all our lives.
It may sound like music to her -- I can do better with my teeth in a cold Shower. Click  click  click.
She's a local. When the dudes come out to New Mexico, they went to wallow in Latin glamour. This is a bad town for blondes.

Yes. So I've noticed. Jerry's noticed - He'll come up with something.

You're lucky. I wish he'd front page for me.
Maybe. For three years I've sung in rats' nests, while Jerry pounded his feet off and his brains out -- trying to get me a real chance. We're due for a little luck!
I mean you being a star and me being just a cigarette girl.
I know. I know. You've got the talent. I got the breaks.
And if you've got cold feet honey, Ill take over for you. That red dress of yours fits just perfect on me.
I bet you try on my coffin some day -- I hope it "fits just perfect."
Oh, dear -- I don't know what I'm going to do without you - honestly, I don't 
Hey  I'm over here.
Hey  I'm over here.
I'll miss you too, honey --
Oh, Mr. Galbraith! I'm so glad you're here.
Good evening.
Good evening.
You know all about these things - - and I've lived here all my life - and I still don't know what the Procession means.
You know all about these things - - and I've lived here all my life - and I still don't know what the Procession means.
It's to remind people of the great tragedy that took place here so that they won't ever forget that a peaceful village of Indians was wiped out by the Conquistadores, back in the 17th Century... A band of monks buried the dead and prayed for them and did penance for their deaths  that's what this procession is supposed to be.

Oh, that's so interesting!
Oh, that's so interesting!
Well, now that you've had your history lesson, I think I'll get on to the museum.
Show business?
Yes. It's always fascinated me. You know, once, when I was a youngster, I went to see Mrs. Leslie Carter in "Zaza." After the play I stood in the alley just to watch her come out.
Well, I'd best be off.
I want to ask you something.
It's about the leopard.
You're worrying about its killing someone else?
You're worrying about its killing someone else?
Yes. I want to go out and patrol the town - be everywhere at once - be sure nothing happens to anybody.

Of course. It's the way any decent man would feel in your position.

You know about animals -- their habits -- will it come back?
You know about animals -- their habits -- will it come back?
No. I'm quite sure.
There is no danger at all. It's a wild animal. Do you think a wild animal prefers walls, streets and people when it can get into open country?
That's right, of course.
That's right, of course.
Don't feel so concerned, Jerry.
Doc -- something you said the other day --
Yes?
Yes?
It doesn't jibe with this  you told me the leopard would go out into the country - it wouldn't stay in the city 

Sure -- certainly - but what's that got to do with this?
Sure -- certainly - but what's that got to do with this?
That's what I don't understand -- why should it come here -- and why didn't it stay here? It's got trees and bushes here -- outside nothing but cement and asphalt.

Jerry, I talked to you about the habits of an ordinary wild leopard. This leopard is another matter entirely - - a caged animal travelling around with Charlie How Come for years and years.. That's why it kills human beings.

Why?
It doesn't know how to hunt its natural prey.

But it doesn't eat what it kills.
Caged animals are unpredictable. They're like frustrated human beings. I can't answer your question.
Just a minute, Robles. Let him go on.
I can understand about the cat killing the first girl. Charlie How Come told me. All that noise and those lights -- scared crazy it would do anything. Last night there was nothing to disturb it. Just a little girl alone in a cemetery.
You know Charlie How-Come?
We're old friends.
Come to look around?
More or less.
More or less.
I'll take you about. Got some nice things.
Charlie and I were talking. That's one reason I wanted to see you.
About Charlie's leopard?
About Charlie's leopard?
Yes.
Charlie doesn't think the leopard killed the girl in the cemetery.
Charlie likes his leopard.
It could be a man.
It could be. Why would a man kill her? For what? It wasn't robbery. It wasn't a crime of jealousy or passion. She had no enemies.
There are all sorts of men. You get to see some funny ones as a reporter.
I can understand what you mean - demented men, pathological cases. But what sort of man would kill like a leopard and leave the traces of a leopard?
I can understand what you mean - demented men, pathological cases. But what sort of man would kill like a leopard and leave the traces of a leopard?
Some crazy guy.
Some crazy guy.
But he would have to know about leopards - have access to leopard claws and hair.
We had given up digging in a certain barrow. I went back and I tried again. I just had a hunch.
A hunch -- that's all I've got about this leopard thing. It's just a hunch, yet I feel it deep in the stomach. It was a man!
A hunch -- that's all I've got about this leopard thing. It's just a hunch, yet I feel it deep in the stomach. It was a man!
Yes, but what sort of a man?
Yes, but what sort of a man?
I don't know.
I don't know.
You, Charlie -- you know leopards. You might have had an old claw around somewhere, and perhaps a bit of hair from the cage - eh?
Come on, Charlie. Let's go find another and better suspect.
Don't you want to see the rest of the exhibit?
Don't you want to see the rest of the exhibit?
Some other time.
You must admit it's possible that it might have been a man.
Just barely possible - - yes.
You know a lot. You've taken a lot of fancy courses in colleges and that kind of stuff - - what kind of a man would kill like that?
But all those fancy courses were about the dead, Jerry, not the living.
But all those fancy courses were about the dead, Jerry, not the living.
All right -- the dead, then. In history there must have been men like that -- men with kinks in their brains --
Yes. There have been men who kill for pleasure -- strange pleasure. There was Blue Beard in France -- Jack The Ripper in London. It's not uncommon.
If there were a man like that, with a kink in his brain around here loose, what would he be like.
If there were a man like that, with a kink in his brain around here loose, what would he be like.
To the eye? Like other men.
To the eye? Like other men.
I don't mean that. How would he act? What would he do?
I don't mean that. How would he act? What would he do?
He'd act normally when he was with other people. It would be a man who suffered remorse and even pity when it was all over.

Couldn't you tell a man like that when you saw him?
Couldn't you tell a man like that when you saw him?
No. He would be a hard man to find, Jerry. Particularly if he were a clever men. He would go about his ordinary business calmly and coolly except when the fit to kill was on him.

You've thought of all this before. You know it isn't the leopard  Don't you?
It was you, Galbraith!
No.
No.
It was you.
It was you.
Not! I tell you. No!
Not! I tell you. No!
You shot the leopard. We know that. You killed Consuelo. You killed Clo Clo. Then tonight --

I didn't do anything. She screamed. Something frightened her.

It's better you don't know.
It's better you don't know.
Tell me.
Tell me.
Why do yo&amp;i accuse me? You don't know what you're doing -- you don't understand -- nobody understands --
Tormented -- ? Why?
I couldn't rest - I couldn't sleep. All I could see was Teresa Delgado's body -- broken --mangled. I saw it day and night. It was waiting everywhere I turned.

Then you found the leopard --
Then you found the leopard --
I didn't want to kill, but I had to. I heard her in the cemetery - talking to the man in the auto --
Jerry told me you were an expert with animals, Mr. Galbraith. Couldn't you tell where it went?
To know where that leopard went -  I'm afraid you'd have to be a leopard and think like a leopard. I was a naturalist. That hardly qualifies me as an expert in hunting down lost leopards. I used to teach zoology in a little freshwater college back East. I gave that up.
What do you do now?
There's a little museum here in town. They've hired me to run it, We've some interesting exhibits of Indian arts and crafts. It's fun -- and I like living here in New Mexico.
Why did you give up teaching?
Various reasons. But I can't see why you'd be interested in the rather dusty career of William Galbraith  teacher, naturalist, curator -- when you lead such a gay and exciting life yourself.
So you see meeting you is a real thrill for me.
Well, I'm hardly Mrs. Leslie Carter whoever she was. In fact, I'm not even much of a success around here particularly after the backfire on Jerry's little publicity stunt with the leopard.

That was unfortunate.
That was unfortunate.
That was a calamity!
Well, I'm next. You won't hear anything like that, Mr. Galbraith. I'm not a popular favorite since I let the leopard loose.
I'm sure if you are as talented as you are charming, Miss Walker, you have nothing to worry about.
I'm sure if you are as talented as you are charming, Miss Walker, you have nothing to worry about.
Thanks.
I've disturbed you. I'm sorry -
Miss Walker -- I didn't expect anyone 
Of course. Only I'm afraid you'll be cheated. There isn't much of a view of the procession here.
I thought they came right past here 

They do, but -- there are no lights out there - they'll just be shadows -
Wait 
No - really, I can see them -- they're coming now - turn off the lights 
You can go now, Manning. There is no way we can hold you legally responsible.
Thanks, Sheriff.
I haven't done any posse work since last time I rode with Toni Mix at the old Bijou Theatre -- aged six, If you're interested,
Go on foot.
Go on foot.
It's not for me. I'm literally and figuratively a tenderfoot.
That's why it just mauls and tears at them.
Something's wrong with this whole setup --
Something's wrong with this whole setup --
Yes, there is something wrong. People who want publicity and don't mind how they get it --what risks they make other people run - - what agony and sorrow they bring to other people --

I know all that, chief, and I don't like it any better than you do, but there's something else --
What are you getting at?
Nothing much -- just that it might not be a cat this time.
I've been trying to tell him, Sheriff. He won't listen to me.
Let me get one thing clear. Did Galbraith make a direct accusation?
Let me get one thing clear. Did Galbraith make a direct accusation?
No. He was kidding Charlie.
State hunters?
Professional hunters, who rid the state of cougars.
Yes. The lipstick.
Why?
Why?
Ask Kiki. Ask any woman. Girls don't put on lipstick in the middle of the night on a dark, lonely street unless they're with a man or expecting a man.
Chief, don't you understand what this means?
You think Galbraith found the leopard on the day you went out with the posse.
You think Galbraith found the leopard on the day you went out with the posse.
I'm sure of it!
Galbraith knows something. He as good as said so 
I am not interested in what somebody else thinks. You being me facts and I'll act on them.
That's a fact, isn't it?
Yes. And I am taking it to headquarters for examination.
You won't go to Galbraith with me?
Offend a reputable citizen and involve the department in a slander suit? No. I'm in office to protect the taxpayers money  not throw it way. Come on, Charlie.
Get it out of here!
Kiki -- he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.

Now look what you've done.

Don't be soft.
I suppose he was trying to make me feel bad.
And I suppose you don't feel bad!

Well, does everybody love us now? You've been gone long enough to softsoap twenty editors!
Yeah.
Yeah.
And did you find the leopard?
It must be the altitude  you, bucking around the countryside with a lot of bootandsaddle boys --

Forget it. I'm buying a drink for a fellow who was on the posse with me, a nice guy. Come along he'll get a great kick out of meeting you.
Who is he?
You remember the fellow this morning -- Galbraith. You've got time before the supper show.
 As long as my feet held out.
And not a sign of the leopard?
I can use them.
Do they close up every year for this Processionist business?
That was nice of Mr. Galbraith.
He's a nice guy. Vie ought to keep in touch with him.
Pretty. You know -- it's funny but flowers only mean one thing to me now.
I know. Funerals.
I know. Funerals.
Yes.
Jerry, these flowers aren't really for me 
You mean you want to take them to the cemetery.
You mean you want to take them to the cemetery.
Yes. Do you mind?
And she waited here for him?
Robles says it looks that way. Belmonte had already been there and left. They only missed each other by a few minutes.
Why do you want to stay around here? It'll only make you feel badly.
Maybe I want to feel badly.
Maybe I want to feel badly.
That doesn't make sense.
What else do you care about, Kicks?
You. Us.
I'm glad you care about us, Kicks. Sometimes that gets kind of lost in the racket --
Maybe there ought to be less racket and more us.
Confession. I'm a complete softie. I've been conscience-stricken and worried sick ever since that leopard got away --
If that's being a softie -- there are two of us.
Kiki -- it wasn't the leopard.
You're positive of that, aren't you?
You're positive of that, aren't you?
Absolutely sure.
You already know the answer to that. I want this town to be safe and happy again --
I'm no detective. I don't even know how to begin. All I know is I want to do something about all this.
Oh, by the way -- I'm out of cash --
Didn't you take your cut out of the closing check?

I got into a little crap game.

How do you know?

We will 

We stood here once before.

We ought to dare to tell each other everything, Kiki -- you and I.
It's a lovely town - it was until we came and let the leopard loose and all this happened.
Kiki, Galbraith said something to me once, -- something you ought to know. We were talking and he said that people were like that ball on the fountain at the hotel --they got pushed around by things bigger than themselves. That's the way it was with us -- and we were too small to see it that way.
Hot... These roads all round here, closed to the public... Whys that? Military bases? Huh. I guess theres space enough for war games... Must be good for business.
Must it?

By the way, Laurence, were you here last time your mistresss brother came over? You know, just before he disappeared?
I work here, sir. Im here most of the time.

Mrs De Moraes must have taken it hard, eh? Her brothers death.
Dial O-O-O on the telephone if you change your mind about the drink, sir.
Now you know why youre here, Mr Lombard. It might be difficult for someone like you to discern, but we are people of a certain standing.
Appearances can be deceptive, Mrs De Moraes.
Appearances can be deceptive, Mrs De Moraes.
That depends what youre looking at.
Three weeks ago. To borrow money. I wasnt here but he got to my husband, sold him some fancy story about an exhibition of his work and needing money to get new prints made. Carlos handed over £1,000 to get rid of him.
And that is the last time any...
And that is the last time any...
Well, Leon does not need money for prints, Mr Lombard. Does his own printing. Wouldnt want anyone to interfere with his Art! Which, as he subsequently vanished, raises the question: what was the money for? Perish the thought.
What about you, Mrs De Moraes?
I have too much money to work, Mr Lombard.

Is that why your brother braved coming here to ask you for a loan?

Perhaps it wasnt so brave of him. Had I been here I just might have given him his money, Mr Lombard. One can reap rewards from the strangest of conduct, as someone in your line of work ought to know.

Was it cash, Mr De Moraes? The £1,000. You gave it to him in cash?
I wont comment on the time but youll understand if I dont tell you to sit down. Now, spare me the apology and get to the point, will you, Mr Lombard.
Im afraid I have bad news, Mr De Moraes. I have reason to believe your brothers in trouble.
Im afraid I have bad news, Mr De Moraes. I have reason to believe your brothers in trouble.
For your information, Mr Lombard, trouble is possibly the one thing Leon is capable of getting into all by himself. Though I doubt he will not ultimately fail even at that.

Oh-oh! Touché, Mr Lombard! But tell me, what would you know about sisterly love, eh? No. Dont. You might get confused speaking of things you dont understand and we need you clear- headed, at least until youve done what we are paying you for.

You... You found that at Leons?
Theres more. Your brother also purchased a young boy for £15,000.
You seem surprised. Could it be you dont think that badly of him after all? You neednt worry. It seems his motives were pure. From what I can make out he bought the boy to rescue him from further abuse.
What... What are you talking about?
What... What are you talking about?
Your brother got mixed up with child procurers and tried to make this world a better place, Mrs De Moraes. And having rescued one little life he unwisely set out to repeat the exercise. You dont mess around with child procurers. Right now my guess is hes either on the run, held captive, or dead. I understand your misgivings, Mrs De Moraes. But Ive

Excuse me?
Excuse me?
I need the money to smooth my way, you understand? Now, have you got that sort of cash here or do we need to meet in the morning?
I will of course do my best to hang onto it.
Where is it? He. The boy you said my brother bought! Where is he?
Where is it? He. The boy you said my brother bought! Where is he?
I cant tell you that yet. But hes being well looked after.
I cant tell you that yet. But hes being well looked after.
Oh no. Youll have to do better than that, Mr Lombard.
Oh no. Youll have to do better than that, Mr Lombard.
Look, Mrs De Moraes, however much of a let down it might be, your brothers not back to his old weekend tricks! Impressionable as he is, he probably grew tired of healthy girls in grisly poses, tried moving on to bigger things, came upon more than hed bargained for and somehow fancied he could take on the real world. Which he no doubt chanced
How dare you... You dont know this tape belongs to my brother, do you, Mr Lombard?
The question now is whether or not your brother still owns anything, Mrs De Moraes.

Get out of my house. Youre fired, Mr Lombard.

Perhaps I should come back when youre...

No. Youre fired! Get out of my house. And take your sick tape with you...
Laurence!
I was hired by your parents, Mrs De Moraes.
The family hired you and I have just fired you, Mr Lombard.
Why me, Mrs De Moraes? Why should such well-connected people as you hire a small- time French detective to look for their missing son, Mrs De Moraes?

Couldnt Nazi hunters do the job?
I still dont buy your story but I figured it cant do any harm to let you go on with your enquiry. Besides, if you do turn out to be nothing but a cheap little extortioner, we could always get the right people onto you. I trust you know who I am talking about.
You drive a hard bargain.
Thank you for coming. Come in and close the door, will you?
Last night you upset my sleep. Tonight my social life. We have two minutes. My dinner guests are waiting.
You lost my money?
You could say that. And Friedman left this morning for Los Angeles.

Well, I found a little more than that. Let me put it this way:... Last night I thought your brother might be dead, tonight Im convinced he is. That said, I have no evidence and I advise you to let the police deal with it.
Are we understood?
You watched the tape? Friedman and his people dont just provide little kids and videotapes, Mrs De Moraes. Theyre in the import-export business. They run hotels here in London which they probably use as ware- houses and ports of call for their merchandise.

Huh! Really? Hotels?
Huh! Really? Hotels?
The hotels are useful capital investments. The kids liquid assets. My guess is they own hotels across the globe, and travel agencies specialising in flights from the third world to boot.
Minimizes the risks. Children can be moved across borders using reliable businesses. These can also be used to move women and drugs... Anything that makes money really.
W-why are you telling me all this, Mr Lombard?
You drive a hard bargain, Mr Lombard.
You do want me to keep the job, dont you, Mrs De Moraes?

Yes... You woke me up... Its the middle of the night here. Have you found Mr Friedman?
Not yet. The place I hoped to find him turns out to be little more than a contact address. Ill give it 24 hours. He just might show up. If you need to reach me ask for Mr Lamont. Paul Lamont, all right?

Black suits you.
Sorry?
Sorry?
Whats in the bag? Underwear? To seduce your husband? Or is it for your own recreation? Tell me, how come such a handsome couple sleep in seperate bedrooms? Is it because he does it with little children?
Or is it the other way round? The children are needed because you cant satisfy him?
You... You are out of order, Mr Lombard. I...
You... You are out of order, Mr Lombard. I...
You what, Mrs De Moraes? YOU WHAT?
How did you break into my office, Deborah? Ladies of your standing dont learn to pick locks between shopping trips. Come on, Deborah! Acting dumb doesnt suit you! Who knew Id found dirt on your brother, huh? Who knew it was in an envelope? Taking me for dead, whod want to make sure it didnt fall into the wrong hands?
Youre mad...
Youre mad...
Ive had a long and unpleasant day. Im tired and Im angry. But mad? Not yet. I paid Leons boy a visit this morning. Found him alive and well. Why havent you told your husband where he is since reading my note, eh?

You know hed have had him killed, dont you? Does a conscience still burn somewhere inside your sore mind, Deborah? Or is it just cold expediency? Could the boy perhaps come in useful when and if the day ever comes for you to face up to the man you married?

When did you learn about his taste for kids, huh? On your honeymoon? Or was it later, when bitterness set in and you turned against your beloved but weak little brother? How did you find out? Did he confess? Try to convert you perhaps? Or was it womans intuition? Or just the way he fucked you?
You do have a vivid imagination, Mr Lombard. I only wish youd use it fruitfully instead of in being obnoxious. I fail to understand your purpose in this. Still, say what youre owed if you still wish to be paid or get out, all right?
I guess the news youd sent me after Friedman didnt go down too well, eh?
Whatever the reason, Im sorry I did. Goodbye, Mr Lombard. I believe you know your way out.
You knew he had nothing to do with your brothers disappearance, didnt you?

It must be tough being married to Adonis to end up sleeping alone every night. Sleep must be hard coming. Whats harder? The thought of the fine litter you two could have bred if? Or imagining what he does with his children?
Tell me, did he kill his little victims too?
No!
What do you mean, No, Mrs De Moraes?
My brother hung himself.

Does the name Pierre Dreyer mean anything to you? Hes a client of mine and a friend of your husband.

Leon hung himself.
Leon hung himself.
Adonis thought your brothers bodyd be found reasonably quickly when he hung it in Epping Forest, didnt he? Seemed like a good idea. An ex-junkie, obsessed with death; the perfect candidate for suicide. He just forgot one thing: forest ramblers are rare during your average blustery English November. An Englishman might have thought of that, but a Brazilian...

Leons not found, your parents worry, talk of hiring help to find him, even mention their manhunter friends perhaps... and Adonis panics, takes control, brings me in reckoning a small- time detective is unlikely to dig up anything awkward, not before Leons found anyhow. He must have kicked himself when he learned Id exceeded his expectations.

Leon hung himself...
Leon didnt hang himself, Deborah. Your husband killed him and made his death look like suicide. How did he do it, eh? Strangulation? Drugs? No doubt an autopsy will tell.
I doubt Friedman ever even met Leon, Deborah. Friedman dealt with select customers. As for my envelope, had he know where it was he wouldnt have mistaken me for a hitman called Lamont when we met in Los Angeles.
...You-you spoke to him?
...You-you spoke to him?
Not in the strict sense of the word, no. He was in too much of a hurry to kill me when we first met and too wasted in acid when I caught up with him later.
Your brother stumbled upon Adoniss little secret, didnt he? And traded his silence for a kid and some cash. And Adonis fell for it, bought him his kid, sent him away, and then killed him when he came back for more. Leon didnt come here to borrow money for prints. He came to extort a second kids life. Your flunkey let him in, so
If-if my car is there, I could be the one who... Why dont you accuse me of killing my brother?

Kids are not your thing, Deborah. Youd have been ready for me when I turned up with Sleeping Beauty. Damn it! Then too I should have paid more attention. Not Leon, you said. It struck me at the time, but obviously not hard enough. You didnt say My God!, or whatever else well-bred ladies squeak on hearing Uncle Henry misbehaved. Not Leon. Who then?

Leon could still have hung himself.
Leon could still have hung himself.
Oh no. At long last Leon had found a mission. Hed never have killed himself when glory beckoned. Your husband killed your brother. And thanks to you, almost got me killed too.
Youre wrong about my being there, though. Carlos borrowed my car that day, his had broken down... Leon saw it, like you, assumed I was there, thought hed wait to ask for a lift. But Carlos turned up, with the tape you found... Leon got his lift, and accidentally picked up the tape with his photo equipment when he got out. He watched it,
You dont say.
You dont say.
That my brother, my husband and your Mr Friedman were linked, that much I had guessed. But that my husband had killed Leon? No.
Why did you send me after Friedman? To atone for your sins?
I didnt know my husband and Friedman knew each other. I just... Do you think we spoke about it? Ive known for five years. Hes known Ive known for five years... But not once have we spoken about it. There are things one just doesnt speak about...

I didnt intend it that way... It just happened. He heard from Laurence that youd been back. That wed argued. He asked why and it just happened; I told him everything... I couldnt help it. Wanted to see him scared. I had never seen him scared before, you see...

Well, I hope you enjoyed yourself.

Perhaps I did... Until fear turned into panic. Thats when he hit me, and told me hed killed my brother... You dont know what youve done, he said. Were in deep trouble, he said. We, he said. We. Wed both be killed if Friedman ever found out you were working for us, he said. We had to stop you and Friedman meeting...
You know something? Ive just seen so much ugliness I dont think Id mind four walls and dinner served every night at a regular time. Id hoped to have a private word with Adonis, but if thats the way you want it.
What are you doing? You cant. I...

Do you think wed let him get away with the murder of my brother?
We? You and your parents killed your husband?
We? You and your parents killed your husband?
No. Not us...
They found his body yesterday. In the pool at our house in Sao Paulo. He drowned. Drank too much, went for a swim and drowned.
Your flunkey said he was expected back tonight.

My parents flew back from Israel... Told him they would get him killed unless he flew back to Brazil immediately and agreed to a divorce. He flew back to Brazil... And his drowning was arranged...

Directory enquiries. Can I help you?
Yes. Im trying to reach a friend but I cant get through. The number is 01766 770 471.

01766 770 471. Let me check it for you, sir.
Theres nothing wrong with the line, sir. Are you sure you have the right number? 770 471 is the number of a call box.

Croissants.

Im sorry, sir. Could you try that again?
Im sorry, sir. Could you try that again?
Croissants. Like that...
The word for those things is croissants.
Not in America, sir. You must be from Europe. So, black coffee and a couple of crescents.
May I ask where youre from, Mr Lamont?
Europe... France. Im French but I live in London... ... England.
Europe... France. Im French but I live in London... ... England.
Youre a long way from home...
You wouldnt have a cigarette, would you?
I dont smoke. If you could get to the point...
Youre sure you wont sit down, Miss Stewart?
Im fine standing, thank you.
Is this some kind of sick stunt? Let me guess. You want money, right?
A small loan would be welcome. More urgently, I need access to a telephone and an address where things can be sent to me.
I cant believe this... Whats coming now, eh? If I dont pay all Hells gonna break loose, is that it?
Well, Id sooner mug an old lady...
Well, Id sooner mug an old lady...
You... Jesus Christ!
Okay. The woman just cant walk away... I want straight answers. No hesitation or I walk for sure. Why cant you go to your Embassy?
French people need a visa to enter this country. That takes time and I didnt have any. I used a British passport. My names not Lamont but Lombard. Xavier Lombard.
Where were you staying before the attempt on your life and why cant you go back there?
The Mondrian, room 504. I was checked out in my absence.

By your Austrian?
By your Austrian?
Yeah.
You dont know why hes come to Los Angeles? The man you say he killed? Who was he? A colleague of his?
No. A poor little rich boy who thought hed save a few kids from their retailer. He disappeared on his second shopping expedition.
Have you never heard of collect calls, Mr...
Lombard... It will take a few days for the things I need to get here. Meanwhile Id sooner not draw police attention walking the streets like a hungry dog...

You know where to look for your Austrian, right?
I know where to look.
I know where to look.
I might come back, I might not. But if I do, it wont be for a couple of hours.
Thereve been 7 international treaties since 1904 aimed at preventing child slavery. But still no worldwide body dedicated to investigating the maltreatment of children used in sexual exploitation. Officially, its just not called for. Sit down. Can I offer you some coffee?
I wouldnt mind. Thank you.
A recent acquisition. Weve had four break- ins this year alone; files stolen, computers wrecked, faeces smeared on walls. The good guys dismiss us as alarmist do-gooders; the bad guys will risk prison to intimidate and rob us. An easy living indeed, Mr Lombard. I got through to Moreau and Jane. I left your landlord out of it. Your flats been broken into. Jane
Hah... What about Nathalie?
Hah... What about Nathalie?
No answer. You have no passport and your Embassys out. How do you plan to leave the U.S., Mr Lombard?

Im sure Ill find a way.
Im sure Ill find a way.
Like youll find a way to stop your Austrian killing you a second time round?
Thank you for the guided tour, but would you mind telling me what were doing here?
How come youre alive? Child traffickers usually achieve what they set out to do. What am I really looking at here, huh? Are you really not just a lousy private eye? Am I really looking at some kind of cunning dispenser of justice in disguise?

Did you call me up here to enjoy yourself, Emily, or to let me use your phone? Because we seem to have a slight problem...
Its give and take time, Mr Lombard. You need help, we need information. You didnt really expect me to put my ass on the line helping a criminal just for the thrill of it, did you?
A criminal?
A criminal?
Did you not enter this country illegally?
Huh... I have no... ... hard evidence...
Come on, Mr Lombard. You tailed your man all the way here from Europe. You told me you knew where to find him, remember? Or didnt I hear you right?
A little too tight, eh? ...They were my sons. Only thirteen and already six feet tall. A real lanky boy... I... Theres some cold chicken salad in the fridge if youre hungry.
Thank you. But I think Ill go to bed. Its been a long day.

Dont fall asleep with your hair wet.
What am I to do with the packages if...
Burn the passport and keep the money. Think of it as a donation to the cause...
Get a pen and dont ask any questions.
Oh. What... Yeah. Okay.
Oh. What... Yeah. Okay.
Route 395. Past Edwards Air Force base and about half a mile before a place called the Red Mountain Motel. Theres a dirt track with a Closed to the public sign. It leads to some kind of ranch in the middle of nowhere. If you havent heard from me by morning send the cavalry, okay? But not before, you hear?

I think so. And if it comes to it, tell the cops anything you think will make them move. Whatever you came up with couldnt come close to how bad it is. Bye now.
Look, you dont tell me about some Godforsaken place where stuff so bad even I couldnt imagine it goes down and expect me to go quietly to sleep! What happened? Whos the guy? The Austrian?
Whos the guy? Whos the guy! Nom de Dieu! Had the guy got a closer look at you or your number plate Id have had to kill him.
What...?
What... Some kind of organ factory... Pregnant girls doped up. Babies. Theres a lot of people back there. Theyre holding a seminar. Traffickings the past, breeding the future...
Friedmans dead... They killed him...
So who... Whos the man? Where is he?
So who... Whos the man? Where is he?
Some Italian I picked up back there. Hes in the boot of the Mustang.

Who knows. Who cares... You wanted slime. You got slime.
No one saw me but the Italian and a dog. I blew up their generator. They thought it was an accident but by now they must have realised one of their party is missing. It might make them feel insecure enough to decide to pack up...
Were both thinking the same thing, right?
Were both thinking the same thing, right?
Do you know a friendly cop?
Call from the motel and tell him if he moves fast enough there might be something left of a body dissolving in acid. Can I have the keys to your house?
That-that wont do. Thats not the way it goes. You saw it, you tell it, thats the way...
That-that wont do. Thats not the way it goes. You saw it, you tell it, thats the way...
Im finished here and Im tired, Emily. You shouldnt be here. Now dont make it worse.

A seminar in a baby breeding farm! Bodies in acid! You think Ill get anywhere with that? Jesus! With luck I might raise a laugh. They might even send a patrol car to check the place out. Whatever, itll be too late.

Look! Either you talk or the creeps are gonna walk. For gods sake. What am I supposed to say? I got this from a French guy from England who broke in there to have a chat with an Austrian child trafficker? Is that it?
Damn it! You cant fucking walk away from this!
Its up to you whether they walk or not.
...Im Emily Stewart. The hysterical female who sees evil everywhere since the day her thirteen year-old boy disappeared. The pain in the ass who cries wolf at the drop of a hat. However I go about this thats who I am. Do you get what Im fucking saying, Mr Lombard?
What about your friendly cop?
What about your friendly cop?
My ex-husband. My work drove him away. Made his life a misery. He thinks Im obsessed, punishing myself for what happened to our son. But hes a good guy. Hell listen to you. He wont turn you in if I ask him not to. I can pretty much guarantee that. Okay?
Theyd never let me go. And youd end up in more trouble than you know for helping me.
You cannot walk away from this. You cannot.
You cannot walk away from this. You cannot.
I can... The question is, can you lie to your ex- husband?
Nothing sticks to slime, Emily. This should cover what you lent me.
Huh! And they say charitys only rewarded in Heaven... Hallelujah... Christ...
Whitney Armstrong, my deputy. What Whitneys trying to say is that you might not live to tell the tale next time you meet your Austrian...
And losing you, wed lose him. And that would be a shame, dont you agree?
Hi...
If you have hard evidence about a child trafficker, we want it, Mr Lombard. And we want it before you get yourself killed...
If you have hard evidence about a child trafficker, we want it, Mr Lombard. And we want it before you get yourself killed...
Most of our information comes out of the mouths of babes, Mr Lombard - confused and frightened victims. Its all too easily discredited, you understand. Now, you might be just what weve been waiting for. Your information could be enough to make em sit up and listen.
Weve still got the Italian...
Thats right. Wheres the fucking Italian, eh, Mr French hero?
Look at him, Whitney. Come all the way from England to clean up California. Huh!
Emily...
Emily...
No. Youre looking at a real Musketeer here, Whitney. Brave and rash. Had to dash in there. Take a prisoner... Might as well have sent them a notice to quit... Come on, Musketeer! Got anything to say?
Shit! Fuck! Whats fucking wrong with people! Im going to bed. And sweet dreams to you to!
Shell be alright. Shes tough...

What about the staff? Theyre in on whats going on, arent they? How many of them?

F-five. The Wilsons and their three kids. They run the place. Look, man, Ive got to get to...
What colour is your car? What colour is your car?
B-Black...

Downstairs... At the front... Jesus...
Im sorry but Mr Gluck is not answering, sir. Would you like to leave a message?
Ill call again.
The Hyatt. Good afternoon. May I help you?
Can I have the reception desk, please.
Does Mr Gluck call for his messages?
Absolutely, sir. As a matter of fact he called this morning, sir.
Absolutely, sir. As a matter of fact he called this morning, sir.
Next time he calls tell Mr Gluck he better be there to take his calls at 9 tonight or at 9 in the morning if he cares about his puppies. Got that?

Got it. Puppies.
You sure you passed on my message?
I certainly did, sir...
Hello again, neighbour. I didnt intrude, did I?
How are you, Jane?
How are you, Jane?
Fine. How was the match? Did you loose?
Fine. How was the match? Did you loose?
No.
No.
Must be your lucky day then. Ive got your accounts - you dont owe much tax for last year.
Must be your lucky day then. Ive got your accounts - you dont owe much tax for last year.
Good.
Good.
Yes. But my boss reckons youd still be better off as a limited company. For expenses and all that, you know? Itd cost you about £100 but he said itd be worth it. Of course, youd need a partner to register. But thats a formality. I mean, I could be your partner. I mean, just as a name, right?
Have you heard of a French film called La Collectionoose?
La what?
La what?
La collectionoose. Its about a young girl in the south of France who seduces a different man every night and then meets one who resists her. Its on TV tonight and as Im in I thought we could perhaps look at your accounts and... The review says its about the conflict between intellect and instinct. And witty. The directors supposed to be famous. Rommel

Its Friday night, Jane. What happened to your latest boyfriend?

Oh... We split up.
Oh... We split up.
Well, I hope youre not too heartbroken and...
Well, I hope youre not too heartbroken and...
Oh no. Im all right. He was a jerk, really. Another boy, you know? All I meet is boys. When I think of all the fuss about older men fancying young girls. I mean, is it true?
Ive got work tonight, Jane.
Oh yeah! Better be good and hurry away then! Who knows? We might be being watched! Maybe one of your stupid French companies has got a detective prying into your life - after all, thats what they do to their employees, isnt it? Huh! Hope you enjoy ruining peoples lives. Thanks for the lift!
Shes pretty... See you, huh?
Bye bye, Jane. And dont be naughty.
I came to feed your fish. I didnt know...
Oui, bonjour, Jean... Oui, très bien, merci. Dites-moi, pourriez-vous me dire si vous avez recommandémes services àquelquun récemment... Vous êtes certain... Non, non... Je vous remercie...

Its not.
Its not.
Well, Im sorry. I... This is my nephew... And my brother, Tim. Ive got the week off and hes come to stay.
Piss off!
Thanks for cleaning my flat and sending my money, all right?... Come on, I need you. Its important.
Just ask if they can recall recommending my services to anyone in the recent past. Say youre my secretary, all right?
Your secretary, huh!
Your secretary, huh!
Id appreciate it if you could do this for me. If you cant, dont worry about it. Ill call in about an hour anyway. Sorry but Im in a hurry.

What are you up to, eh, Savieer? I mean, not this but... Money, passports, a gun in a microwave? Who are you, eh? Who are you?

Yes. How did...

Thank you, Jane.
Good afternoon, Mrs...?
Spitz. We spoke on the telephone. My husband... My daughter, Deborah, whose house this is. My son-in-law, Carlos... The gentleman is a business partner of his.
May I...?
May I ask if you are Jewish, Mr Lombard?
Lombard, this is not a Jewish name, is it?
I hope its not too significant.
I hope its not too significant.
What if it is?
What if it is?
Well, I would have to point out that we could have dealt with that question when you called this morning, Mrs Spitz. I wouldnt like to think Id kept you waiting for nothing.
Whatever, you come recommended. We...
Recommended?

Must I speak to you in French?

Didnt you say I came recommended? Thats what I thought. May I know by whom?

Okay. Recommended...

Good. Now, as I trust you may have guessed, we are looking for someone to work for us. Someone whose discretion can be relied upon. Someone who while in our employ would give us full commitment. Do you think you could be that person, Mr Lombard?

Look Mrs Spitz... I dont know to whom Im indebted for the recommendation but... Im not in the business of making oaths of allegiance or giving myself character references. What I do is listen to what the people who care to call me have to say and judge whether or not I can be of help. I hope you can appreciate that, Mrs Spitz.

What I can appreciate is insolence, Mr Lombard!
I take it your son is called Leon?
Leonard. What my daughter is on about, Mr Lombard, is that Leonard is somewhat of a Bohemian. You might as well know that...
What do you think has happened to your son, Mrs Spitz?
You wouldnt be here if I knew, Mr Lombard. What I do know is that he has not been at work for three weeks. That enquiries to the police and London hospitals have borne no results. And that a check with his bank revealed he has not used his account for four weeks now.

Do what, Mr Lombard?

Check with your sons bank. Banks dont usually give out information about their customers.

I said earlier that my husband and I are supporting Leonard in his photography, Mr Lombard. By this I mean that since his return from America I have been depositing for him a monthly allowance in an account we jointly hold. So as you see, I did not have to break the law to find out if he used the account.

Then why arent you asking the police to look for your son, Mrs Spitz?
I take it your son is not married, Mrs Spitz?
No. And before you ask, no, hes not gay! He has had girlfriends, but nothing serious...
No. And before you ask, no, hes not gay! He has had girlfriends, but nothing serious...
Any friends?

The proprietor of his workplace is the only friend of his we know about. His address is in this envelope with Leonards address, keys and other things you might need.

Im sure... As far as you know, when and where was your son last seen?

The £1,000 is on account.
My rates...
My rates...
We are aware of your rates, Mr Lombard. We will pay you double your rates plus expenses. In return, need I say it again, we expect discretion and undivided attention.

Why do you think your son chose not to come to you for funds for his photography, Mrs Spitz?
Why do you think your son chose not to come to you for funds for his photography, Mrs Spitz?
Ha... No, Mr Lombard. His monthly allowance is all he is to expect from us. He knows it and we feel the amount is more than adequate.
My husband and I will be leaving tomorrow for a short stay in Israel. Deborah will be here if you need anything before our return.
Fine. One more thing, Mrs and Mr Spitz; may I ask what is or was your occupation?
£10,000 a year to the girl for as long as she looks after the boy?
Plus a trust fund to provide for the boys education.
Look at it this way. He might achieve everything your son never did.
Jah...
What happens now?
We conclude our transaction.
The rooms yours for 24 hours. Its sound- proofed, stocked up with food, drink and other things you might find useful. You can do anything you like.
Anything at all?
Anything at all?
Anything at all. I presume you wont want to take the boy with you when youre finished? Theres a £500 fee for disposal. The boy is yours, you understand?
Vous êtes Français?
Does it matter?
Problems?
Is my money in there?

Uh-huh. You couldve waited for me inside.
Lets go.
I dont know what your problem is, but...
I dont know what your problem is, but...
Right now your big friend at the Diplomat is bleeding fast, Martin. He might still possibly survive if attended to soon. And he did cooperate.
Am I supposed to know him?
Six weeks ago. He bought a boy of yours.

Huh, I doubt it... Friedman only deals directly with select customers. I handle the rabble...
Where is Friedman?
Look, I dont think youre fully aware of what youre playing with here, Mister. Whoever put you up to this either pays too well or misinformed you. Why dont you just tell me what it is you want so we can do business in a civilized manner, eh?
Friedman lives with you at the Ambassador?
No. In Hampstead... Why?
No. In Hampstead... Why?
Dont jump any red lights.
This car needs petrol.
Shut up and drive!
Youre out of your mind. Whats the idea?
Maybe the thought of people like you going on holiday bothers me. Come on, lets go...
Is it real? You people are sick.
Huh. Id have thought a tough guy like you would know better. The sick ones are out there, friend. They make up the clientèle. Get rid of them and were out of business.

Boys like the one you met today are surplus. Commodities worth a handful of notes in whatever arsehole of the world they happen to be born into. We improve some lives buying them where theyre not wanted, improve still more selling them where they are. Is that too hard for you?
You know what, Martin? I ought to tie you down with your old arse up in the air and advertise the hole in the middle of it to the world. Free. And hope you never die.
Huh... Im sure thered be lots of takers.

We need a double-room and as I understand youre here alone wed be much obliged if youd agree to move to a single room...
Five to three. Youre early.
Should I come back in five minutes?
I gather weve done business with a friend of yours?
Have you?
Have you?
The person who put us in touch seems to think so.

I dont recollect mentioning a friend.
Your lady friend did.
The ladys not a friend. Shes a whore. Someone at a special screening I attended mentioned certain goods could be got from an Austrian here in London. And not just movies.
And while visiting our fair city you... An Austrian?
An Austrian.
An Austrian.
An Austrian... Not much to go on, is it?

Questions can amount to revelations. Now, Id hate to think I was made to come here carrying a substantial amount of money in order to be subjected to a cross- examination. Mr Friedman led me to believe we had a deal. Do we?
Will you be alone? The merchandise. Is it just you or...
Ill be alone.
Ill be alone.
You must agree to be blindfolded... Just for the journey. It might appear unseemly - youre the paying customer - but ordinarily clients come with some kind of endorsement.
Evening. Table for one?
No. Thank you. Could you tell me if Leon Spitz is here, please?
No. Thank you. Could you tell me if Leon Spitz is here, please?

Im sorry...
Im sorry...
Yes. You wouldnt know where I could reach him? We had to discuss an exhibition of his photographs at my Paris gallery, you see? I really need to see him before I leave.
This is private property. The public footpath is back to the left of the bridge.

Havent you? Then why the worried messages on his answering machine, Rhian? Id have sworn you expect him to be in trouble.
You-youre wrong. I just called to ask if I could stay with him next time Im in London. Thats all.
What are you going to do now? Call the police? Take him away? I must warn you hes terrified of men, so...
Shut up!
We didnt quite make it as lovers... Leon is a good man, though...
Did Leon tell you why he didnt want the police involved, Rhian?
Did Leon tell you why he didnt want the police involved, Rhian?
He just said he had good reasons.

Good reasons?
Good reasons?
Thats what he said. I tried to dissuade him... Told him I couldnt take on another child, that hed get into trouble... I mean, people who sell children... But he wasnt listening... I guess he finally found himself a crusade... His family think hes back on drugs, eh? Huh... Leon did drugs. A lot of drugs. Went through his self-destruct phase, you know? Things

Yeah... But he didnt beat the demons... A quarter of all the shoes sold in Europe are made by or retailed through his parents leather empire. All started from a small shop in the East End of London and war reparation money for holocaust victims.

Theyre German Jews. Came here before the war. They both lost all their families in extermination camps, but they themselves never went near one. The idea that his family wealth was started with money he believes should have gone to camp survivors has been haunting Leon. Its not guilt, more of a curse... And then theres something about his parents being involved with Nazi

Is she on the phone?

Yes...You-youre not going to take Shiva away?
I cant think of a good reason for it - for now anyway. My number if anything happens. Whats your sisters number?
Oh, I... She just moved. Ive got her new... Its in my book in the kitchen. Wait... Thank you.
And you better stop greeting strangers with a shotgun. If Leons Austrian was looking for you I reckon hed have found you before I did.
Im sorry. Its just you dont look local...
Im sorry. Its just you dont look local...
No sick people in the country, huh?... Just tell me one thing, Rhian. Leons story about the boy? You just took his word for it?
No sick people in the country, huh?... Just tell me one thing, Rhian. Leons story about the boy? You just took his word for it?
Hed come prepared. He had something besides Shiva... Sleeping Beauty. The Disney film... Well, it looked like the Disney film. It was something else. I couldnt watch...
Whats the date?
The nineteenth... How come you didnt know?
The nineteenth... How come you didnt know?
Ive been away. Did Leon speak to you about his sister?

Er... Yes...

Did he ever refer to the hostility between them?
Did he ever refer to the hostility between them?
He... Apparently the hostility was all hers. Leon didnt... It hurt him. They used to be close... Their parents were in their forties when they were born, you see. And mostly away. They grew up in a Scottish mansion with old nannies and servants. He... Our world was so old and cold, we shone for one another, Leon used to say. His sister cut
The money Leon left for the boy, was it cash?
Yes. Three thousand pounds. I still...
Yes. Three thousand pounds. I still...
Did he mention anything about having an exhibition of his work?

... No.
... No.
You sure? What about before he turned up with the boy?
You sure? What about before he turned up with the boy?
... No. In fact, Id seen him a couple of months earlier. He was quite depressed. His work wasnt getting anywhere. He said he was going to try something new, realism, London in the nineties - documentary stuff, you know...
He showed me a book with a picture of a couple caught kissing in a street...
Hows the boy doing?
Hows the boy doing?
Fine...
Fine...
Good. You neednt worry about the Austrian anymore. Hes dead. Ill be in touch.
And you aint neither one of those damned Mexicans who end up littering the landscape after getting ripped-off by their friendly cross- border guides, are you, mister?
No...
No...
I didnt think so. The rags on their sorry backs are the only wordly possessions those wretched creatures are ever found with... I dont wanna know who you are or how come you ended up roasting in Owl Canyon. But you might as well know Id have let you fry to a buzzard meal if not for this...
Now, can you stand up? Can you use your legs and stand up?
I... How long have I been here?
I... How long have I been here?
Three days and thats three days too many.Come on. Get your ass up.
Huh... I guess you aint quite ready for civilisation yet... Ill give you one more day, a meal, and then youre on your way.
Los Angeles?
Los Angeles?
Los Angeles is 100 miles away.
Los Angeles is 100 miles away.
Id appreciate it if I could use your phone.
Id appreciate it if I could use your phone.
Im sure you would. But if I had one, I wouldnt let you near it. Now you tuck back in and rest until youre told otherwise. And for what its worth, I wouldnt try anything that might be construed as unappreciative of my hospitality. Id sooner shoot you than have you upset me...
Barstows 30 miles to the left. Los Angeles a hundred to the right. Wherever youre heading, I reckon somebodyll pick you up.
Huh... I suppose the idea of a one day trip to Los Angeles doesnt appeal to you...

Is that where lawyers toil for an industry that turns serial killers into heroes who give thrills to young women who write erotic novels about psychopaths and rapists? You go to your world, Ill stay in mine. So long, Mister.
Welcome to the club.
Excuse me?
Excuse me?
I hear youre looking for Leon. That makes me, his old-lady, and now you, looking for the little bastard. Leons gone, man. Vanished. You interested in his photographs?

Uh-huh.
No shit... Well, Im afraid I cant help you.
No shit... Well, Im afraid I cant help you.
I take it you dont know where he is, then?
I take it you dont know where he is, then?
Huh! You could always try Suicide Bridge. You dont know Leon, do you?
Huh! You could always try Suicide Bridge. You dont know Leon, do you?
I know his work better than I know him.
I know his work better than I know him.
Let me put it this way then; the photographs and the man? One and the same, man, one and the same. At best fucking weird, at worst fucked-up fucking weird. Maybe you should think yourself lucky. Some folks just aint worth getting involved with. And Leon sure is one of em.

Small, blond, good-looking. She was with him when we met. She had a funny English accent.

Would you know where I might reach her?
Would you know where I might reach her?
Yeah! Somewhere in Wales. I dont really know her. Used to turn up in a Transit van on weekends, sell old furniture at Camden. Thats how come he only laid her at weekends, ha ha...

Yeah. Why? Youre going to look for her... Shit! You really think his pictures are that good?

Fucked-up fucking weird.
Quest-ce que tu veux?
Un Autrichien. Negociant en pré- pubescents.
Whats an hour of your time worth these days, Nathalie? Combien, Nathalie!
Cinq cents.
Cinq cents.
Viens.
Jai bien peur quil te faudra attendre. Pas avant la matinée.
Tu sais où me trouver.
Bye. And thanks... Nathalie gently closes the door, eyes Lombard who shakes himself awake... rolls her eyes and surveys the room...
Où est passé ton salon?

Mon bureau coûtait trop cher.

Eh bien... Tes sûr que tas besoin de moi? La petite ma lair assez bien foutue, non?
Alors?
Alors quoi?

Le montage, lemballage. Not your regular street muck, is it? This is collectors stuff. How much would it cost me?

A lachat, trois ou quatre mille. En location, cinq cent. Mais ça pourrait faire plus. Je ne sais pas. Cest pas vraiment mon truc. I dont know any Austrian, Xavier.

But maybe you know someone who does. An Austrian, in London, dealing in kids and snuff videos. How many can there be? These people supply to order. He has to be known, reachable.

Then why dont you reach him?

I dont have your credentials, Nathalie.
We are so alike, Xavier. Still, sometimes I wonder which one of us is the ugliest.
If you can, send me a receipt.
Okay, shitbag. Im only going to ask you this once. Where is Friedman?
Who? I dont know who the fuck youre talking about, sunshine.

Gluck.

Glucks dead, you sonofabitch!
Youre the lantern man, huh? If you wanna see whats left of him...
The acid bath?
The acid bath?
Huh! Youve been around, eh?
Why did you kill Friedman?
Let me give you a tip, asshole - no one pulls stunts like what you pulled in London and here tonight and hopes to get away with it. It upsets people. Its wrong. Fucking wrong.

Nice way to help a colleague in trouble.

Thats just it. The sonofabitch didnt ask for help from his colleagues... Testa di cazzo! Hiring some amateur outsiders to fix you... He hasnt gone to hell too soon... And neither will you, Mr Lamont!
Are you telling me Friedman didnt tell you I was here looking for him?
If he had, youd be dead.
If he had, youd be dead.
So why didnt he?

What do you think, huh?

I think youd rather not know what I think.

Huh. Maybe he figured the news our London bureau got a visit from a hitman on behalf of a pissed off client wouldnt go down too well. He only shared his guilty secret last night. And then only cause he was so fucking edgy after calling his hotel we persuaded him to talk.

So you killed him and went to clean out his hotel room... How did Friedman say he got to know where to find me?

Thats the beauty. An anonymous call. Makes you wonder how many people know what youre up to, eh, French-fuck?
Try again, and this time be polite.
I can only tell you what he told us...
I can only tell you what he told us...
Not even scum like Friedman would go to the trouble of killing a stranger on the strength of one anonymous call.

Some guy called to let him know the Frenchman whod called the night before he left London was in L.A. looking to kill him. He did his sums and decided to take the call seriously.

Shut up and walk...
What you gonna do? Kill me?
Dont tempt me. The last scumbag who thought I might kill him died soon afterwards.

Huh. Im a businessman. What are you, eh?
Moreau? Cest moi. Alors...
Salut, Laurent. Ouais. It wasnt easy but I got what you wanted through Interpol. Say, whats your business with these Spitzes?

They lost their son. Why?
They lost their son. Why?
It appears that in their younger days they were actively involved with a shady German group of Nazi hunters known as Never Forget. Over the years were talking about a dozen or so execution-type killings.

Are they still operative?

Their last suspected kill occurred two years back, though your Spitzes now probably do no more than bankroll the group. Still, Id watch my step. These people are well-connected, Laurent; former Israeli prime minister, etc. The ladys also president of an international Zionist organisation... Anyway, you get the picture.

Mossad?
Mossad?
Its a good guess...
Ha ha... Yes. With prices reaching an all time low, the name of the game has become have-it- where-its-at... As we all know, transportation has always been the costliest and trickiest part of this business...
Cost what?

Costliest!
Costliest!

Oh dear, why is life so complicated? Sometimes I really wish I could be someone else.
That's a good idea, sire.
That's a good idea, sire.
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
Let someone else pretend to be you, and see if...
Let someone else pretend to be you, and see if...
... if she can find me? -- That's a brilliant idea! If she's really been sent by God she'll discover the trap, and if she's an assassin she'll kill the wrong man! Bring her up!
Why not you -- Jean d'Aulon? The only man who's poorer than I am, and so the only man I can trust. Dignified, honorable, wise... what more could we ask of a king?
My lord, I'm not sure that...
My dear Aulon, to you it shall befall the honor of impersonating the royal blood!
Majesty, I can't...
Majesty, I can't...
Why, are you not ready to die for your king?
Why, are you not ready to die for your king?
Of course I am, it's just that...
Of course I am, it's just that...
Good. Until then, feel free to live like a king!
Sire, you know how bad I am at this sort of game.
So... pretend it's not a game.
Jeanne, this is -- in fact -- my loyal friend and finest archer, Jean d'Aulon. Jean... I place her in your care. Find her suitable lodgings -- here -- in the castle... and guard her with your life.
Yes, my lord.
Here... to help pay Jeanne's ransom. All the Captains gave what they could, as well as the citizens of Orleans and the other towns she saved...
Very generous of you all. How much?
Very generous of you all. How much?
10,000 gold crowns.
My dear Aulon... That's fine...
Jeanne's been badly injured! She jumped from the top of a tower into a frozen moat!
It's a miracle she's not dead!
We have to do something before she tries it again! I beg of you, my lord, don't let her down... let me organize an escape...

But not impossible... Gilles and La Hire are ready to risk everything to save her...

Jean... me dear, loyal Jean... why do you want to oppose the will of God? Jeanne wanted to go to Compiegne -- we let her -- she got caught. Then, on my personal orders, Regnault proposed 30,000 crowns for her ransom, and once again the answer was no. And now you say she tried to escape, and the answer is still no. Jean, open

No. I see the hand of Tremoille, and Regnault, and Yolande, and you... and they are dirty hands.
What do you fear most now... my sword? ... or his hands?
Tremoille... don't. Please...
Listen, please accept my apologies for... you know, me pretending to be the... well it wasn't really my idea... well, yes it was my idea but...
Do you think I could have some water?
I would like some fresh straw.
Louis... water and fresh straw!
And I would like to see a priest.
Now?
Now?
Yes. I didn't confess today.
Yes. I didn't confess today.
Right. Raymond... a priest.
I shall also be needing a war horse -- mine is too slow -- and armor -- and a good sword -- and an artist to make me a banner.
Now?
Now?
Better today than tomorrow.
Better today than tomorrow.
Well... uh -- this might take a little time -- but let me see what I can do.
I also need someone who can read and write.
This I can do. I was studying at the University of Paris -- till the English invaded it.

I thought you were an archer?

Yes, I am. I'm an archer who can read and write. Who do you want to write to?
Yes, I am. I'm an archer who can read and write. Who do you want to write to?
The King of England. I want to give them the chance to leave Orleans in peace before I get there.
Who do they think I am?!
Jeanne, calm down. You can't blame the people -- they've been hearing all about you for weeks.
Jeanne, calm down. You can't blame the people -- they've been hearing all about you for weeks.
There's nothing to hear -- I haven't done anything. And why haven't I done anything? Because none of you will listen to me!!
Jeanne, stop it!
How dare you stop me doing God's will!
He didn't tell you to cut all your hair off...!
How dare you tell me what God tells me to do!
How dare you tell me what God tells me to do!
Alright, whatever -- but since He's not going to come down and cut it himself, at least let someone cut it properly!
What did they say?
Uh... they said... they will think about it.
Uh... they said... they will think about it.
Good.
Good.
But... to be honest... I don't think they'll leave tomorrow.
What's going on?!
They've started the battle without me!
Not so... easily. Why aren't you... fighting...? go on... we're almost there...
Jeanne, you've been badly wounded...
Jeanne, you've been badly wounded...
No, it's... it's nothing, it's...
Alright... I promise to rest if you promise... to go back to the battle.
I promise...
The king said you're his finest archer...?
Well...
Well...
Come with me...
Jeanne, calm down, do you hear me? Are you alright?
Yes...
Yes...
It's over, Jeanne. We won, just as you said!
I'll go.
Jeanne, no...
Jeanne...! Are you alright?
Yes. Yes, I'm fine... We need more brushwood! Why are you staring at me like that?
Yes. Yes, I'm fine... We need more brushwood! Why are you staring at me like that?
Because there's an arrow in your leg.
Jeanne... the king has ordered us not to ride with you anymore.
So... what am I supposed to do now?
They've abandoned me... like everyone.
What... what do you mean?
What... what do you mean?
It's been weeks since they spoke to me. Since the coronation... no signs... nothing...
It's been weeks since they spoke to me. Since the coronation... no signs... nothing...
Maybe their silence is a sign...? Maybe it's a sign to go home?

It's not time yet. My mission is not over yet. There is still more I must do before I can really -- finally -- go home.
It's not time yet. My mission is not over yet. There is still more I must do before I can really -- finally -- go home.
But how do you know that these -- these voices aren't really just -- well, you.
Well of course they're me! That's how God talks to me. If you listen hard enough, even you can hear him. Everyone can hear him.
But I hear so many voices... one voice saying one thing, another voice saying the opposite -- love your enemy, kill your enemy -- what is good, what is evil...?

I don't know it. I feel it.

You make it sound so simple...

The truth is always simple... it's you, Jean, who's making things complicated.
The truth is always simple... it's you, Jean, who's making things complicated.
Me?! It's not me, it's God who makes everything complicated! If he's all-powerful, why not let the English stay on their island in the first place? And why let this war go on for a hundred years? And why send you out to fight when a girl like you should be at home with your family? Why, why?!

So... even you don't believe in me anymore...
So... even you don't believe in me anymore...
Jeanne... I believe in you... more than anyone...
If you really want to help me, there's one thing you can do.
Tell me...
Tell me...
Tell the king to give me more men.
That's not what I asked... Why do you want to marry me?
You listen to your voices, I listen to my heart.
What did the king say?
He said that... he's making a treaty with the Duke of Burgundy and...
He said that... he's making a treaty with the Duke of Burgundy and...
It's a trap! They're buying time till they can bring over more soldiers from England!

Did your voices tell you that? You told me you hadn't heard them for months...
Did your voices tell you that? You told me you hadn't heard them for months...
No, but...
No, but...
Or maybe it's Jeanne who's in a trap -- her own trap -- a downward spiral that she can't stop?
Or maybe it's Jeanne who's in a trap -- her own trap -- a downward spiral that she can't stop?
Did you come back to marry me or to insult me?
Did you come back to marry me or to insult me?
To marry you.
I will ask my voices... if they come back one day. Meanwhile... I'm going to Compiegne.
Jeanne... I have been hearing voices -- and believe me, those voices left me in no doubt that you must not go to Compiegne!
Jeanne... I believe in you -- but can you believe in me for once? Don't go... even if you don't want to marry me.
I would like to marry you. But I have already promised myself... to God.
I would like to marry you. But I have already promised myself... to God.
But... you've done so much for God as it is... can't you do something for yourself for once -- for Jeanne?
But... you've done so much for God as it is... can't you do something for yourself for once -- for Jeanne?
But it is what I want.
But it is what I want.
To be killed in battle?
To be killed in battle?
If God wants me to win, he will find a way. And if he wants me to die... if he wants me back... then that's fine too. Then I'll be with him forever.
Will you at least let me stay with you?
It would not be the same without you.
We must sound the retreat!
Not yet!
Get back inside the town and see if the English are attacking from the other side!
But... why... what's the point?
But... why... what's the point?
Do as I say!
Do as I say!
I want to stay with you...
I want to stay with you...
That's an order!
I am ready now...
Just give me a moment and then you'll be free...
Just give me a moment and then you'll be free...
I'm already free...
I'm already free...
Yes yes... any moment... you're always so impatient...
My gentle Captain... I'm staying.
I -- I don't understand...
I -- I don't understand...
One day you will.
One day you will.
You don't know what you're saying. You're going to leave this place, Jeanne -- you're going home -- or whatever you want -- you're going to be happy, and have children, and...
... and maybe the king will give you some money, and a little land, and a title even... ... wouldn't that be a fine thing? You, a lady of title!
I'm staying, Jean.
I'm staying, Jean.
No, you must come, Jeanne -- we need you -- so much has happened since you left... I have a new horse now, a white one, just like yours... and La Hire hardly swears at all anymore... You can't stay -- they'll burn you!
No, you must come, Jeanne -- we need you -- so much has happened since you left... I have a new horse now, a white one, just like yours... and La Hire hardly swears at all anymore... You can't stay -- they'll burn you!
I'm not afraid of the fire anymore. It will purify me...
I'm not afraid of the fire anymore. It will purify me...
Jeanne, you can't leave us like this!
Jeanne's alive!
Good.
Good.
We have to press home the attack!
We have to press home the attack!
Sound the retreat...
Sound the retreat...
But I promised Jeanne we'd fight on!
But I promised Jeanne we'd fight on!
I made no such promise. Sound the retreat for the night!
I made no such promise. Sound the retreat for the night!
But that was her order!
But that was her order!
I'm fed up with taking her orders. She swore she'd defeat the English before nightfall, instead of which she goes and plays the fool and gets herself nearly killed! Look at the mess we're in! That's her mess, not mine...! We're worse off then if she'd never come at all! ... now do as I say and Sound the Retreat!
I won't tell you more about that. I'm more afraid of displeasing Him than not answering you...
You're afraid of displeasing God when telling the truth?!
You're afraid of displeasing God when telling the truth?!
No...
No...
Did God forbid you to tell the truth?
Did God forbid you to tell the truth?
No. But my revelations were for the King of France, not for you.
Go onto the next question.
Good advice for the French, not for the English! Do you think God hates the English?
Good advice for the French, not for the English! Do you think God hates the English?
I don't know, but you're all men of the church... why not ask Him yourself?
Is it true that you launched an attack on Paris?
I tried to.
I tried to.
It was on a Sunday, wasn't it?
It was on a Sunday, wasn't it?
I don't remember. Maybe.
I don't remember. Maybe.
Do you think is was a good idea to launch an attack on a holy day?
Do you think is was a good idea to launch an attack on a holy day?
I don't know...
I don't know...
And didn't you order the citizens of Paris to surrender the city in the name of the King of Heaven?
And didn't you order the citizens of Paris to surrender the city in the name of the King of Heaven?
No... I said "Surrender in the name of the King of France"...
No... I said "Surrender in the name of the King of France"...
That is not what is written in the evidence... look for yourself!
I can't read.
Ah, yes, I forgot... God sent us an illiterate peasant to carry out such an important mission! Do you think that God made the right decision, to take an ignorant girl to save the kingdom of France?
Ah, yes, I forgot... God sent us an illiterate peasant to carry out such an important mission! Do you think that God made the right decision, to take an ignorant girl to save the kingdom of France?
I leave the answer to God.
Do you have a sword?
Quite a few.
Quite a few.
Didn't you also carry a banner?
Didn't you also carry a banner?
Yes...
Yes...
Which did you prefer, your banner or your sword?
Which did you prefer, your banner or your sword?
I was forty times more fond of my banner than my sword.
I was forty times more fond of my banner than my sword.
And why was that? Did it have some particular value or power?
And why was that? Did it have some particular value or power?
No, it's just... a sword is a weapon.
No, it's just... a sword is a weapon.
And?
And?
And so I... I prefer my banner.
And so I... I prefer my banner.
Why?
Why?
To avoid killing anyone.
To avoid killing anyone.
Are you saying that if you had not been carrying your banner you'd have killed more people?
No, of course not... I never killed anyone...
Then perhaps the temptation to kill would have been stronger... too strong perhaps...?
Then perhaps the temptation to kill would have been stronger... too strong perhaps...?
No! I warned the English to go back home -- I begged them not to force us to fight -- they knew the defeat I would bring on them... why didn't they listen to me?
No! I warned the English to go back home -- I begged them not to force us to fight -- they knew the defeat I would bring on them... why didn't they listen to me?
We have numerous witnesses who can confirm that you were not always carrying your banner...
We have numerous witnesses who can confirm that you were not always carrying your banner...
Yes, probably... maybe...
Yes, probably... maybe...
So sometimes you were carrying just your sword?
So sometimes you were carrying just your sword?
Yes, but...
Yes, but...
Did you use the sword that you held in your hand?
Did you use the sword that you held in your hand?
No, I... I held it up to...
No, I... I held it up to...
You held up your sword and flourished it about in the air? Like this?
You held up your sword and flourished it about in the air? Like this?
Yes, maybe... I don't remember...
Yes, maybe... I don't remember...
... so you were in the middle of the battlefield, with your sword in your hand, waving it above your head... charging against the enemy, screaming and yelling... fighting for your life... and you want us to believe that in the middle of all this excitement you never killed anyone?
... so you were in the middle of the battlefield, with your sword in your hand, waving it above your head... charging against the enemy, screaming and yelling... fighting for your life... and you want us to believe that in the middle of all this excitement you never killed anyone?
No, I... I never killed anyone!
It is the sacred place that matters, Charles -- not the size. Am I correct, Bishop?
Oh yes, my lady. All true kings of France must first be anointed in our great cathedral of Rheims... with the holy oil of Clovis... for it was within these very walls that Saint Remy received the sacred oil from Heaven, brought to him by a white dove for the anointing of King Clovis...
I don't understand... the holy oil of Clovis... it was quite full the last time I saw it...
And when was that?
And when was that?
Well... at the coronation of King Charles VI...
Well... at the coronation of King Charles VI...
Thirty years ago? I'm not surprised it's gone...
Thirty years ago? I'm not surprised it's gone...
No no, you don't understand -- this is no ordinary oil -- this is miraculous... this oil was brought from heaven by a white dove to crown King Clovis in this... very... cathedral...
W-w-what are you doing?!
Performing a miracle.
Arrest them!
What are you doing? This is an ecclesiastical court -- you have no right to do this!
What are you doing? This is an ecclesiastical court -- you have no right to do this!
Rouen is in English territory. I have the right to do anything I like. Take them away.
Who's running this trial, you or her? I can't believe it! This wretched girl -- how dare she speak to us like that?
She's loyal to her king... it's only to be expected that she...
I understand your impatience, but if you want this trial to be acknowledged as legal we must follow correct procedure and...
To hell with procedure! We paid a bloody fortune for this slut, and we can do whatever the hell we like with her, whether the church likes it or not -- is that clear?

We want her burned as a witch!

But in order to do so, the church must first prove her heresy, or else you'll be burning a martyr...

Well then? Start proving... or else the church will have another martyr!
Calm down, my lord, I beg you!
How can I calm down when I'm made the laughing-stock of the whole court?! I've had enough!

Be patient, my lord... you've seen how it is. This girl has a way with people... but everyday we're making progress...
Be patient, my lord... you've seen how it is. This girl has a way with people... but everyday we're making progress...
So long as this bitch remains alive, our armies refuse to fight! Don't you understand? They want proof that God is on their side... and the only way they're going to believe that is when they see her being burnt as a witch!
It is not for us to burn her, my lord. That is your prerogative.
... and your prerogative is to find her guilty...

But we can't do that unless she admits to blasphemy...
But we can't do that unless she admits to blasphemy...
Well what are you waiting for? You've got a castle full of racks and ropes and pulleys: go and torture the bitch!
You won't be able to drag anything from her that way. You also must realize that many of my colleagues are... well, scared...
Scared of a girl?
Scared of a girl?
Scared to make a mistake. Supposing she's right... supposing she really has been sent by God??
Whose side are you on, Cauchon?
I'm on the side of our Mother Holy Church. Besides, a confession under torture will never convince anyone of her guilt.
I'm on the side of our Mother Holy Church. Besides, a confession under torture will never convince anyone of her guilt.
Well find some other way! Be creative. Tell them she fucks the devil... Hmm, not a bad idea... why can't you say that? Sounds good to me... and who can prove she doesn't?
So... here is the famous Jeanne... Savior of Orleans... terror of the English? You look pretty ordinary to me...
Am I... am I dead?
Am I... am I dead?
Dead you're worthless, darling.
Dead you're worthless, darling.
Where... where am I?
Where... where am I?
Guess.
My king will pay any ransom you ask.
Your king? Ah yes, of course... What's he going to pay me with? Cows? Chickens? I prefer gold, and the English have plenty. I wonder how much they'll pay... to have the Witch of Orleans in their clutches? Those English are so arrogant, they can't accept the idea of being defeated by a peasant girl... it has to have been the devil's work.

God defeated the English, not me.
God defeated the English, not me.
And God who allowed you to be caught?
Are you alright? Did they hurt you?
No no, I'm fine, really...
No no, I'm fine, really...
I was so worried -- we've all been looking for you! The English are everywhere! O thank you, lord!
Really?
I was talking to the priest, and do you know what he said to me?
Quick -- hide in here...
What about you?
What about you?
Don't worry about me -- just stay in here... and don't move!
Don't worry about me -- just stay in here... and don't move!
But where are you going to be?
But where are you going to be?
I'll be right here... I promise.
Oh, thank you Lord! I'm so glad to see you! I need to confess... I haven't been confessed since Easter... or been to Mass... Will you hear me now?
I will hear you... but not now, not here.
I will hear you... but not now, not here.
Who are you?
Who are you?
Pierre Cauchon, Bishop of Beauvais. As you were captured in my diocese, the duty of conducting the trial falls upon me.

Trial? What trial??

Your trial, Jeanne. On a charge of heresy.

But... the King -- my king -- didn't he pay my ransom?

It seems that the English care more about you than the French.

Yes. They paid your ransom... tomorrow you will be transferred to their great castle at Rouen.
Take the Holy Gospels in your hand and swear to tell the whole truth concerning everything you will be asked.
I don't know what you're going to ask me questions about. You may ask things that I won't want to answer.
You will swear to tell the truth about whatever you are asked.
I will willingly swear to tell the truth about earthly things, but as for my revelations, I've never told anyone except my king... Charles the Seventh... the one and only king of France.
You must take the oath! Not even a king, would refuse to take an oath to tell the truth in a matter of faith.
I will willingly swear to tell you what I am allowed to tell you, but as to the rest, even if you threaten to cut off my head, I still won't tell you.
So... begin by telling us your name -- assuming you're allowed to tell us that much?
My name is Jeanne. My little cross I had round my neck was taken away from me. I would like to have it back.
Show us a little more cooperation first. Where were you born?
In a village called Domremy.

Not unless you hear my confession.
Jeanne, listen to me very carefully. We are all men of faith, and we shall earnestly strive for the salvation of both your soul and body as though it were our own. We do so in the name of our Holy Mother Church, who never closes her arms to those who would return to her. But we cannot help you unless you submit to
Not unless you hear my confession.
Jeanne -- be careful -- you're not helping yourself by refusing to submit to our judgment...
And you be careful, you who claim to be my judges, for you too will be judged one day...!
Jeanne, you are not helping yourself. If you don't answer our questions properly, your refusal will be taken into account.
These questions have nothing to do with your trial.
These questions have nothing to do with your trial.
I assure you they do. So... answer me... when was the last time you heard this voice?

Last night.
What were you doing when the voice came?
Praying.

The voice was in your cell?

Yes.
Yes.
What did it tell you?

Many things...
Many things...
Did it give you advice? Good advice?
Tell us, Jeanne... do you often hear this voice?
Yes...
Yes...
Is it here? Now? In this room?
Let me clarify things for you, Jeanne. On the one hand there is the Church Triumphant, that is to say God, his saints, and the souls that are saved. And then there is the Church Militant, that is to say our Holy Father the Pope, the cardinals, the prelates of the Church, the clergy, and all good Catholic Christians. Moreover this Church, when assembled,
So it is the Church Militant that refuses to confess me, and so prevents me from being a good Christian?
It is for us to determine whether you are a good Christian, not you.
I am sent by God, and I submit all my words and deeds to His judgment. Or do you think that you are better judges than He is?
Jeanne, I beg of you... sign! In God's name, don't you understand? I'm trying to save you! If you don't sign, the English will burn you to death! Is that what you want??
No... I want to be confessed.
Sign this, and I will confess you myself if you want.
And may I go to Mass?
And may I go to Mass?
As often as you like -- now, please -- for the love of God -- sign!!
Please... may I have it back...
You have nothing to regret...
I didn't mean it! I didn't know what I was signing! You tricked me...!
Silence her! Take her away...!
I don't understand, Jeanne... why did you do it? Why?
And you? Why did you lie? You promised I could be confessed...
And you? Why did you lie? You promised I could be confessed...
I know, Jeanne... it was the only way to save you from the fire!
I know, Jeanne... it was the only way to save you from the fire!
It's not my body I want to save. It's my soul.
I ask only one thing... to hear me in confession...
I -- I can't Jeanne... I can't hear your confession... I'm sorry...
Good day, sir. I trust my honorable Duke of Burgundy is feeling well?
He's feeling wonderful.
He's feeling wonderful.
Thanks be to God.
Thanks be to God.
And your Duke? The Duke of Bedford?

Buying her?
Buying her?
This word is -- regrettably appropriate for the situation. In fact what we -- the Church -- wish to do is determine whether or not this girl is sent by God, as she claims. You understand that we cannot allow just anybody to abuse God's name in this manner...

I understand. How much?
20,000?! But... I heard King Charles was... financially embarrassed.
Don't look at the cost, look at what it brings. What is your last offer?
Your health and happiness has always been my first concern, Charles... ever since you were a little boy -- and I think I know you better than your own mother...
You think?
You think?
Mmmm. Yes. I know for example the sickness that plagues your heart. I know how painful it is for you... to have loved a father... without ever knowing if he really was yours.

W-w-what has that got to do with this Maiden?

You're a fine judge of character, Charles. It'll take you less than five minutes to expose her if she's a fake. But if she's not -- then she will give you your answers... and place the crown on your head.
You will??
For the sake of France, Charles. And for the sake of my grandson.
It's true. There's only one king... people need to be reminded of that. Nevertheless... Jeanne has done so much for us...
I assure you, Charles, the Maiden has no greater admirer than myself. But whatever our personal feelings, we cannot allow her to conduct her own private war. For the sake of the kingdom, it is imperative that you stop her going to Compiegne...

I... I can't stop her.
Don't worry, Charles. If God is still with her, she will be victorious. We're not her judges... we're just spectators. Let her go to Compiegne, as you let her go to Orleans, and let God decide her fate.
But... her army's so small now...
But... her army's so small now...
Then her faith will have to be bigger.
There's no need to be afraid, sire.
I'm... I'm not the king...
I'm... I'm not the king...
I know you're not yet -- but you will be, soon.
What was my mission? To help my country? But how could I do that? I was only a poor girl who knew nothing about riding or making war... so I decided to wait and not to speak to anyone about it.
You did well...
You did well...
I didn't wait long. One day I was going to Mass, like I do every day, when the same strange wind started blowing again...
... and what... what did he say?
He said that I have to save France from her enemies and give her back to God, and He told me that I -- Jeanne -- will lead you to the altar at Rheims to be crowned King of France.
I don't need lodgings if we're to be marching on Orleans...
Orleans has held out for six months. I don't suppose a few days will make much difference. Take some rest.
Ah, Jeanne... come here...! This whole coronation idea of yours is a fiasco... nothing is ready...
... You look wonderful...
... You look wonderful...
... and my crown doesn't fit and... Really??
Get them out of here!
Now hold on -- you're not captain here... on the battlefield perhaps, but not in the royal bedchamber!

She says she'll be here tomorrow...!

You mustn't see her, my lord. We know nothing about her... we don't even know if she is from Lorraine.

What difference does it make where she comes from?
What difference does it make where she comes from?
If she comes from Burgundy it makes a difference. It might be a trap... Look... Signed "X". What sort of name is "X"? Or must we conclude that a messenger of God can't even write her own name?
Not exactly. She wants you to give her an army -- at your expanse. Bearing in mind that your mother stole every last piece of gold in the treasury, I fail to see how you can afford such an adventure.
I can see her if I want to. I mean, with half of France in the hands of the English, what have I got to lose?
I can see her if I want to. I mean, with half of France in the hands of the English, what have I got to lose?

Your majesty, I urge you not to see this woman. It all reeks of a Burgundian trap!

My captains have sworn their support.
No doubt your captains will fight for your fine cause -- but what about the ordinary soldier? They don't fight for causes these days. They fight for money. Who's going to pay them?
He's probably right -- let's call a delay...
There's no time, sire -- we can't hold up the ceremony... there's no telling when the English might come back... they're only ten leagues away...
There's no time, sire -- we can't hold up the ceremony... there's no telling when the English might come back... they're only ten leagues away...
Let them come! Let them see who's the true king of France!
I... I don't know... it'll sound like we... betrayed her...?
Noooo!
When you saw your king for the first time, was there an angel over his head?
If there was, I didn't see it...
If there was, I didn't see it...
Then why did your king believe in you without any proof?
Then why did your king believe in you without any proof?
Go and ask him yourself.
You told us about the appearance of this... voice. What exactly did you see? Part of it... or all of it?
His face.
His face.
Does he have hair?
Does he have hair?
Yes.
Yes.
Is it long and hanging down?

5,000 gold crowns.
That's not a lot.

8,000. We can't raise more... We can only place ourselves at the mercy of your generosity.
I must offer to the Duke. I will give you his answer tomorrow.
Were you sent by Lord Dunois?
Yes... they were.
Yes... they were.
Good. Where are the English?
Good. Where are the English?
Everywhere. Where is the food?

He's on the other side of the river.
Wait, wait...
For what?
For what?
Because... because -- I mean -- the English have a broad sense of humor, but... I mean, you don't understand... to them you're a witch, working for the devil. What makes you think they'll listen to you?

Because if they don't, I'll raise such a war-cry against them that they will remember us forever!
Well. I'd love to see that, but after taking counsel with my captains, I felt it would be better to first bring the food into the city, then wait till Alencon arrives with reinforcements before doing anything.

Fine -- go now if you want, but not with me! You may have a duty to God but I have a duty to my people, and my people are starving! So right now I'm going to take the food back to the city, and if you can please calm down, and let me accompany you to Orleans, it will be my honor to
So... what is the message?
We offer the English a last chance to return home in peace. If they refuse, we recross the river and attack them here -- at the Tourelles.
Jeanne, that really makes no sense at all. The Tourelles is virtually impregnable... besides, if we're on the other side of the river attacking the Tourelles, what's to stop Talbot attacking the city from the north?
God.
You know, I feel a great sorrow for you, because you're laughing now, but by tomorrow night some of you will be dead and having to repeat your jokes in front of God.
Jeanne, with respect -- we can't just attack the Tourelles like that -- it's a very complicated matter and...
Jeanne, with respect -- we can't just attack the Tourelles like that -- it's a very complicated matter and...
What complicated about it? All you have to do is do what you're told -- what could be simpler than that? I'm the drum on which God is beating out his message -- beating so loudly it's bursting my ears -- but you're all so full of your own voices, you're deaf to His!
"Be patient, be patient"... is that the only advice you can ever come up with?? I've shown more patience than a dozen saints!
Jeanne, you have to understand -- it's not easy for us -- I mean for our pride -- to suddenly be usurped by a -- well, with all due respect, by a... girl.
Jeanne, you have to understand -- it's not easy for us -- I mean for our pride -- to suddenly be usurped by a -- well, with all due respect, by a... girl.
Ah, so that's it. To you I'm just a girl.

Jeanne, put yourself in my shoes for a moment -- how would you feel, if you were me?
Jeanne, put yourself in my shoes for a moment -- how would you feel, if you were me?
Knowing what I know? Enormous gratitude.
Dunois... was it you who ordered the attack? Answer me?!
Can we -- uh -- discuss this later?
Can we -- uh -- discuss this later?
Sooner is better than later!
Position the long-bows over there, crossbows over there -- and set up Dijon Culverins either side of those trees...
The wind will be against us...
The wind will be against us...
The wind will be with us! Do as I say.
What's going on?
We're taking back the Tourelles!
Jeanne, what are you doing with that... you've got it back to front...
I know what I'm doing, so either lend a hand or go back to bed!
Stand by with the battering-rams...
We need another ten minutes...
We need another ten minutes...
The bridge won't wait!
Well...? Shall we go?
Not yet.
Not yet.
The English won't wait.
My lord Dunois... I have wonderful news! -- finally -- he's sending her to us -- thanks be to God -- we're saved -- it's wonderful!
Calm yourself, Xaintrailles. Now slowly. Who has finally done what?
Calm yourself, Xaintrailles. Now slowly. Who has finally done what?

And it's not the first one! They say she saved a little boy who was dying of...
And it's not the first one! They say she saved a little boy who was dying of...
Xaintrailles...! Don't talk to me about miracles... If I was still sitting there waiting for a miracle, I'd be dead now. Anyway...
But... don't you think we should at least... go and... welcome her?
As long as she brings food and supplies, she'll be welcome.
Brilliant idea... but to be really effective, why not send a whole army of virgins?
That'll put fire in my soldiers!
God... why of course -- we'd forgotten about him! Strange, I don't seem to remember seeing him at Agincourt.
Damn right!
Damn right!
Oh, but I forgot! It was a Sunday... that explains it. God's day off.
I do love her when her fire gets well and truly stoked!
Me too...
There must be something we can do for her for Chrissakes!
Yes. We can pray.
Yes. We can pray.
Good idea...
This is no good!
No good? This is a disaster!
And... what does Jeanne think?
I don't think. I leave that to God. I'm nothing in all this, I'm just the messenger.
We return to Orleans... across the bridge, at the Tourelles.
But the bridge has been pulled down!
But the bridge has been pulled down!
The English are rebuilding it.
Clear?
Perfectly.
You look disappointed... Isn't this what you wanted?
No... not like this...
No... not like this...
For weeks you've been asking for this... well now you have it!
Jeanne... let him do it. One more dead body's not going to make any difference, so who cares?
I care! And I care because God cares! All life is precious to God -- even his -- even yours and mine...
Bravo! What about all the other hundreds of prisoners? Do we let them go too?
Maybe... I don't know... but first we have to confess...
Jeanne... The men are exhausted!
I know, but so is the enemy -- they're falling back -- Paris is ours...!
I know, but so is the enemy -- they're falling back -- Paris is ours...!
Jeanne... we're not enough...

So... bring up the reinforcements!

Reinforcements? Where??
Right behind us -- Dunois with another then thousand men!
Jeanne, look behind you.
Jeanne, look behind you.
Never look behind -- only ahead!
Do you know how to count?
Of course I do? Bring them up!
Of course I do? Bring them up!
Jeanne... that is not ten thousand reinforcements -- that is one hundred very loyal but very tired soldiers.

To hell with your voices -- it's time to face facts! We have nothing to do here... none of us... not even you. You should go home, Jeanne.
Who told you to wear men's clothes?

It seems to me that the Church and Our Lord are one and the same. Why must you complicate what is so simple?
Tell us, Jeanne... why did you jump from the tower at Beaurevoir?
I had been sold to the English. I'd rather die than fall into their hands.

Did your voice tell you to jump?
Did your voice tell you to jump?
No...
No...
So when you jumped, you wanted to kill yourself?
So when you jumped, you wanted to kill yourself?
No...!
No...!
How can you deny it when you just said "I'd rather die than fall into the hands of the English"...?

That's now what I meant...
That's now what I meant...
Do you not know that suicide is a very grievous sin? No one is allowed to destroy the life that God created!
Do you not know that suicide is a very grievous sin? No one is allowed to destroy the life that God created!
I know, but that's not the way things happened...
I know, but that's not the way things happened...
You mean it was not of your own free will that you were on the ledge?
You mean it was not of your own free will that you were on the ledge?
Yes, but...
Yes, but...
And you didn't jump of your free will?
And you didn't jump of your free will?
No!
No!
Oh? Perhaps someone pushed you then?
Stop it! What are you doing?
Nothing... just taking his teeth.
Nothing... just taking his teeth.
But you can't just kill a man for his teeth!
But you can't just kill a man for his teeth!
Why not? He has good teeth...
Why not? He has good teeth...
Because... because you just can't!
Besides, what about these...?
That's different... I mean... we were fighting for a... for a cause!
Yeah...
Here -- take this instead.
So who gave the order to bring me to this side of the river??
Hey, my friend! I'm glad to see your ugly damn face again!
Hey, my friend! I'm glad to see your ugly damn face again!
La Hire, I'm warning you -- don't swear!
La Hire, I'm warning you -- don't swear!
Sorry Jeanne... Did you both meet already?
Jeanne, let me introduce the king's half brother, the dogged Lord Dunois.
Then, Lord Dunois, show me the way to the other side of the river...
Jesus Christ... the goddamn English will pay for this!
They will -- and so will you if you go on swearing like that.
What happened? Who gave the order to attack?
God knows, but it was a bad idea!
God knows, but it was a bad idea!
Were the men confessed? Where are the priests?
I swear I'll never swear again in my life if you save her life! But I'm warning you, if you let her die, then you're the biggest...
Don't swear...
Physicians are a waste of time. You'll have more luck with this charm of mine... it saved my life at Agincourt!
I'd sooner die than use magic!
Prepare these as battering-rams!
What's the use? The drawbridge is up!
What's the use? The drawbridge is up!
Not for long...
We... won?!
Won?! Such a small word will never do! This is victory, Jeanne, this is... glory!
You call this... glory...? All this... this blood... this smell of...
... the smell of victory, Jeanne! Mmmmmmm! I love it!
... the smell of victory, Jeanne! Mmmmmmm! I love it!
It's not possible...
Take mine instead -- here -- smash mine first!
Jeanne... get up... this is ridiculous...
Jeanne... get up... this is ridiculous...
If you kill him, you kill me!
Jeanne... the man hasn't been paid for six months -- that's his only reward. Let him take a few teeth...
A few teeth... that's the price of his life?
Jeanne, if you don't mind... I'll stay standing... this armor... it's a nightmare to get back up...
I said, kneel!
You don't believe me anymore?
We still believe in you, Jeanne. If it were up to me, I'd chase every goddamn Englishman into the ocean. But it's not up to us anymore -- it's up to the king...
When you were taken prisoner at Compiegne, did you have a horse?
Yes... a half-steed... white.
Yes... a half-steed... white.
Who gave you that horse?
Who gave you that horse?
My king.
My king.
How many did he give you?
How many did he give you?
Five steeds and a few hackneys...
Five steeds and a few hackneys...
As much as for a Lord? What an honor! Did your king give you other wealth apart from horses?

No.
No.
What about all those dresses you were given... silk dresses weren't they?

Yes, I was given a few, but I never had time to wear them...
Yes, I was given a few, but I never had time to wear them...
Still, pretty wealthy for a peasant girl wouldn't you say?
Still, pretty wealthy for a peasant girl wouldn't you say?
And you look pretty wealthy for a servant of God, wouldn't you say?
Jeanne... what are you doing?
Playing...
What have you done to me?
I -- I -- I...
Who... who are you...?
I am that I am. You don't like my face? Maybe you prefer this one...
Who are you to even think you can know the difference between good and evil? Are you God?
No... no... I'm just a messenger... He needs me... a higher calling...
I don't know... I thought...
YOU THINK GOD ISN'T BIG ENOUGH TO DELIVER HIS OWN MESSAGES?
YOU THINK GOD ISN'T BIG ENOUGH TO DELIVER HIS OWN MESSAGES?
I don't know... please... tell me I'm dead...
I don't know... please... tell me I'm dead...
WHO ARE YOU TO DECIDE IF YOU SHOULD LIVE OR DIE?
WHO ARE YOU TO DECIDE IF YOU SHOULD LIVE OR DIE?
I... don't know... what do you want from me?
I... don't know... what do you want from me?
Nothing. I'm here to set you free...
What are you doing out here?
I might ask you the same question.
I might ask you the same question.
I... I'm leaving... I can't take anymore...
I... I'm leaving... I can't take anymore...
And what exactly is it that you can't take anymore of?
And what exactly is it that you can't take anymore of?
Everything! Prison -- humiliation -- being abandoned and betrayed by everyone -- I can't stand it anymore -- I'd rather die!
Everything! Prison -- humiliation -- being abandoned and betrayed by everyone -- I can't stand it anymore -- I'd rather die!
You'll be dead soon enough anyway, so why be in such a hurry? Why not face up to your lies? It's your lies you can't stand anymore...
You'll be dead soon enough anyway, so why be in such a hurry? Why not face up to your lies? It's your lies you can't stand anymore...
I... I never lied!
I... I never lied!
If you were true to yourself... if your faith was firm, you wouldn't need to run away from yourself like this...
If you were true to yourself... if your faith was firm, you wouldn't need to run away from yourself like this...
I am true -- to my Lord, the King of Heaven. He knows how much I love him -- that's all that matters to me...

How can you pretend that you love God when you're about to throw away the most precious thing he gave you? Life is a gift, you should know that by now Jeanne -- a gift from God. You know what He'd say to you, if He was here? "What are you doing to me, Jeanne?"
That's too easy. One minute you want to die, the next you want to live... Do you think that life is a toy that can be played with and then broken when you don't want it anymore?
No, no... I'm just so tired, and lost, and... I didn't realize what I was doing!
Oh? And just because you realize now, everybody else should forgive you?!
I don't know -- I don't care anymore -- I just want to be at peace!
I don't know -- I don't care anymore -- I just want to be at peace!
Oh, so you don't want war anymore? You want to be at peace? You want to be able to change your mind anytime you feel like it and expect everyone to go along with it?
Oh, so you don't want war anymore? You want to be at peace? You want to be able to change your mind anytime you feel like it and expect everyone to go along with it?
I don't understand. What do you want from me?
I don't understand. What do you want from me?
I told you already... I'm here to set you free...
Why were you yelling like that?!
What are you doing here? Please... leave... you can't stay here...
What are you doing here? Please... leave... you can't stay here...
Why? Are you waiting for someone else?
Why? Are you waiting for someone else?
Yes!
Yes!
Who?
My... visions...
They're going to come and visit you in here?
They're going to come and visit you in here?
Yes... that's what I pray for...!
Yes... that's what I pray for...!
I want to see that. Do you mind if I stay... on the side? I won't bother you.
I want to see that. Do you mind if I stay... on the side? I won't bother you.
No, no -- you can't stay or they won't come!
No, no -- you can't stay or they won't come!
Why not?
Why not?
Because... I have to be alone!
They won't come anyway.
What do you mean, they won't come?
What do you mean, they won't come?
Why would they?
Why would they?
Because! Because I've always been faithful to God, and I've followed everything he said... and I've done everything he asked me...
Because! Because I've always been faithful to God, and I've followed everything he said... and I've done everything he asked me...
God asked you to do something?
God asked you to do something?
Yes... lots of things!
Yes... lots of things!
You mean God said, "I need you, Jeanne?"
You mean God said, "I need you, Jeanne?"
No, but... he sent me so many signs!
No, but... he sent me so many signs!
What signs?
What signs?
Like... like the wind... and the clouds... and... the bells... and what about that sword lying in the field... that was a sign...!
Like... like the wind... and the clouds... and... the bells... and what about that sword lying in the field... that was a sign...!
No. That was a sword in a field.
No. That was a sword in a field.
But... it didn't just get there by itself.
But... it didn't just get there by itself.
True -- every event has an infinite number of causes -- but why pick one rather than another? There are many ways a sword might find itself in a field...
I'm not lying, I... I can't remember... leave me alone!
Oh? You can't remember? Let me help your memory...
No! I don't want to know anymore! Leave me alone! I didn't kill that man!
Oh no? How about this one?
Stop, stop... I can't remember! The battles were all so confusing... there was so much smoke, dust, noise... I was being attacked on all sides, so... maybe... perhaps I fought back but it was only to defend myself...
So your memory's coming back?
So your memory's coming back?
Yes... yes! And now you tell me why God let all these battles happen in the first place... if he's so powerful... he said he's "the creator of heaven and earth, the source of all life..." he could have easily stopped all this blood and misery? Why didn't he?
Yes... yes! And now you tell me why God let all these battles happen in the first place... if he's so powerful... he said he's "the creator of heaven and earth, the source of all life..." he could have easily stopped all this blood and misery? Why didn't he?
Is he the one who spread all this blood and misery?
Is he the one who spread all this blood and misery?
No, but... why didn't he stop it? Or did he get pleasure, watching us killing each other in his name?
No, but... why didn't he stop it? Or did he get pleasure, watching us killing each other in his name?
In His name??
In His name??
Yes! We fought and killed in His name... the King of Heaven!
Yes! We fought and killed in His name... the King of Heaven!
Really?
"Let all who love me follow me"... Where does God get mentioned? Come on Jeanne, be honest. You fought for yourself, in your name.
I... I was defending myself as best I could! Everyone has the right to defend themselves, don't they? Or should I have let myself be killed?
I... I was defending myself as best I could! Everyone has the right to defend themselves, don't they? Or should I have let myself be killed?
No, no, you did fine. I'd even say well done. Besides, most of the ones you killed probably deserved it, don't you think?
No, no, you did fine. I'd even say well done. Besides, most of the ones you killed probably deserved it, don't you think?
No, I do not think so. I don't think that killing each other will ever bring peace.
No, I do not think so. I don't think that killing each other will ever bring peace.
I agree...
I don't agree. Why do you have to keep changing your mind all the time?
Why are you doing this to me?? Do you get pleasure from hurting me?
Why are you doing this to me?? Do you get pleasure from hurting me?
Ah, pleasure... that's a difficult word to define. When does the pain end and the pleasure begin...? When did your pleasure begin with that sword in your hand...?
Ah, pleasure... that's a difficult word to define. When does the pain end and the pleasure begin...? When did your pleasure begin with that sword in your hand...?
I never took pleasure in hurting anyone?
I never took pleasure in hurting anyone?
Really?
I -- I cleaned up my room, look... and I said my prayers... all of them... and...
What are you doing on the wall?
What are you doing on the wall?
I'm trying to make my cross look more beautiful...
I'm trying to make my cross look more beautiful...
What for?
What for?
Because... because I don't know what else to do to please him.
Because... because I don't know what else to do to please him.
Do you think this cross will protect you?
Do you think this cross will protect you?
No, I...
"Love your enemies"...
Good. But "love your enemies"... body and soul.
My voices... my voices... do you think they will ever come back?
I don't think so.
I don't think so.
Are you going to leave me too?
Are you going to leave me too?
Yes... of course... when you don't need me anymore.
Yes... of course... when you don't need me anymore.
Are you sent by God?
There's nothing for me to do here anymore... I don't belong here I want to be with Him now...
Do you think you are ready?
Yes I am.
Are you willing to follow all His commandments?
Are you willing to follow all His commandments?
Yes...
Yes...
... to love your enemy as much as you love yourself?
