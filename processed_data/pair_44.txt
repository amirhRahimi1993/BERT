Oh, yes. Fine. No after effects. But as I remember now, that water was cold, wasn't it? What a terrible thing to do... and you were so kind... It's a formal thank-you letter. And a great big apology.
You've nothing to apologize for.
You've nothing to apologize for.
Oh, yes! The whole thing must have been so embarrassing for you!

Not at all, I enjoyed --
-- talking to you...
I enjoyed talking to you.
Would you like some coffee?
No! No, thank you!
I couldn't mail it; I didn't know your address. But I had a landmark. I remembered Coit Tower and it led me straight to you.
The first time I've been grateful for Coit Tower.
I hope we will, too.
What?
What?
Meet again, sometime.

We have.
Good-bye.

Ah. That's what I was going to do.
Ah. That's what I was going to do.
Oh, yes, I forgot: It's your occupation, isn't it?
Don't you think it's sort of a waste for the two of us to...
Wander separately? Ah, but only one is a wanderer. Two, together, are always going somewhere.

No... no, I don't think that's necessarily true.
Do you know where you're going?
Of course not! I'm a wanderer! I'd like to go somewhere I've never been!
Of course not! I'm a wanderer! I'd like to go somewhere I've never been!
How can you be sure?

If I've been there? That's silly! Either you've been to a place or you haven't.
How old?
Oh... some, two thousand years, or more.

Of all the people who have been born... and have died... while the trees went on living.

When you jumped in the bay, you didn't know where you were. You guessed but you didn't know.
I didn't jump, I fell! You told me I fell!
I didn't jump, I fell! You told me I fell!
Why did you jump?
Why did you jump?
No!
No!
What was it inside that told you to jump?
No, I can't tell you!
What?!
What?!
No! Please! Please, please, please, please, don't ask me!
Take me away from here?
Home?

...somewhere in the light.
I'm responsible for you now, you know. The Chinese say that once you have saved someone's life, you are responsible for it forever. And so I'm committed. And I have to know.
And you'll go on saving me? Again and again?
There is so little I know. It is as though I were walking down a long corridor that once was mirrored, and fragments of mirror still hang there, dark and shadowy, reflecting a dark image of me... and yet not me... someone else, in other clothes, of another time, doing things I have never done... but still me... And I can't stop to ask
Yesterday.
But the small scenes, the fragments in the mirror: you remember them.
Vaguely...

What do you remember?

A room... there is a room, and I sit there alone... always alone...

This part is dream, I think. There is a tower and a bell and... a garden below... but it seems to be in Spain... a village in Spain. And then it clicks off, and is gone.

No!
If I could find the key... find the beginning put it together...
And so explain it away? But there is a way to explain it, you see. If I'm mad? That would explain it, wouldn't it?
I'm not mad. I'm not mad. And I don't want to die, but there's someone inside me, there's a somebody else, and she says I must die... Scottie, don't let me go!
I'm here, I've got you...
I'm here, I've got you...
I'm so afraid... ...you won't let it happen...
Don't leave me... stay with me...
All the time.
I should have phoned... but I wanted to see you... be with you...
Why? What's happened?
Why? What's happened?
I had the dream. The dream came back again...
No, don't go away!
Only this far.
Where's your husband?
I didn't wake him. I don't want him to know...
It was a dream, you're awake, you're all right, now. Can you tell me?
It was the tower again... and the bell, and the old Spanish village...

There was a village square, a green with trees... and an old whitewashed Spanish church with a cloister. Across the green: a big, grey, wooden house with a porch and shutters and a balcony above... a small garden, and next to it, a livery stable... with old carriages lined up inside.
Go on.
At the end of the green there was a whitewashed stone house with a lovely pepper tree at the corner --

No, never!

Madeleine, a hundred miles south of San Francisco there's an old Spanish Mission, Mission San Juan Bautista. It's been preserved exactly as it was a hundred years ago as a museum. Now, think hard, darling. You've been there before. You've seen it!

No, never! I've never been there! Scottie, what is it? I've never been there!
Go on with your dream. What was it that frightened you?
I stood alone on the green, searching for something, and I started to walk to the church. But then the darkness closed in, I was alone in the dark, being pulled into darkness, and I fought to wake up...
Here with you.
And it's a all real.
And it's a all real.
Yes.
Yes.
Not merely as it was a hundred years ago. As it was a year ago, or six months ago, whenever you were here to see it. Madeleine, think of when you were here!
My love... because I love you.
I love you too... too late... too late...
I love you too... too late... too late...
No... we're together...
No... we're together...
Too late... there's something I must do...
There are things I have to tell you, about how we met, and why we are together. But they can wait. The only important thing now is that I love you and I'm going to keep you safe.
You can't.
You can't.
Why?

Let me go.

To the church, I must go there.

You believe that I love you?
Yes.
Yes.
And if you lose me, you'll know that I loved you and wanted to go on loving you.
And if you lose me, you'll know that I loved you and wanted to go on loving you.
I won't lose you.
Let me go into the church alone.
Why?
Why?
Please. Because I love you. He stares at her, sees the pleading look in her eyes, and lets go. She turns and walks away toward the church, slowly, her head bowed. He watches her go and starts to move after her. Then slowly, as she goes, her head begins to go up until finally, as she walks, she is staring high above her. And
Is there something I can do for you?
Yes... you run this hotel.
Yes... you run this hotel.
Oh, yes!

Would you tell me, who has the room on the second floor in the corner, that corner?

Oh, I'm afraid we couldn't give out information of that sort. Our clients are entitled to their privacy, you know. And I do believe it's against the law! Of course, I don't think any of them would mind, really, but still I would have to know who you are, and ask --
Oh, dear! Has she done something wrong?
Please answer my question.

I saw her come in five minutes. ago.

Oh, no! She hasn't been here at all! I would have seen her, you know. I've been right here all the time, putting olive oil on my rubber plant leaves!

Would you please go and look?

Tonight we return once again to the cave. Tonight we let the monsters out. We fill ourselves with the spirits of Genghis Khan, Joe Namath, JFK, Paton, Lombardi, Hemingway...
Franco mother-fucking Harris!
I was just playing...we were playing just playing around.
She's dead.
We were playing...she slipped...she hit her head.
Playing?
The floor was wet. She slipped!
Why was the floor wet?

I don't know why the floor was wet!

You have acquaintances - business friends and superficial golf buddies. You have always been a fringe player. You have some serious male on male intimacy problems.

What are you fucking talking about?
Fucking Boyd. That fucking idiot. They're on to us.
They're not on to us. I'm gonna call Boyd.
About anybody but yourself. You never have.
And you're a little fucking reject.
And you're a little fucking reject.
Eat my ass!
If you ever touch my minivan again, I'll make you sorry. Real sorry.
You're a loser.
You got a retarded kid and a fat pig wife.

Don't you threaten me you little rat fuck.
Don't you fucking threaten me - I'll fucking kill you.

Four hours and fifteen minutes. I can make Vegas in 3 and change.
I'm not getting a ticket.
Don't even start.
You want to hear me out?
One idea that if you had fucking listened to, you would each be worth approximately 15 million dollars.
You can't keep bringing up Starbucks. That was your only real hit in like 75 tries.

I set up Fisher with the broker that found his house. Took care of that one, didn't I? Prison Communications.
More.
Over eight years of some of the hardest raging experiences of my life.
She's got no fucking pulse.
You don't know what you're doing.
Wait!

Why? Why? She's dead. Why are you calling an ambulance?
We have to call the ambulance.
Why?
Everybody shut up. LISTEN TO ME!
Listen to me. Please. Everybody just calm down a bit here. Okay... First...are we sure she's dead?
Listen to me. Please. Everybody just calm down a bit here. Okay... First...are we sure she's dead?
Her head's bashed in and her heart isn't beating.
Are you sure this was an accident?
You're a lying deviant. What did you do?!
Stop it! Listen to me. Let's just take a second here and take hold of the situation, OK? Let's just review our options here.
We have a dead woman bleeding all over the bathroom. What options? Call the police.

What were we doing officer? Why didn't we help her? Well...we're all a bit high, you know, bachelor party, that kind of thing. Fisher here is getting married in three days...Beautiful wife ...he didn't have anything at all to do with it...It was all Micheal here... just Micheal...
Bury her out in the desert.
Sure, why not.
You don't just casually walk out of a Vegas Casino with a dead woman.
We can do this. We can get her out of here.
We can do this. We can get her out of here.
Have you completely lost your mind? So you get her out of here. So you get her out into the desert somehow, without anybody seeing, so what, you don't think at some point somebody might notice that she's gone?
Have you completely lost your mind? So you get her out of here. So you get her out into the desert somehow, without anybody seeing, so what, you don't think at some point somebody might notice that she's gone?
Nobody knows she's here. I called her personally. Nobody knows.
Her blood is all over the bathroom. I'd say that's a bit of a DNA problem.
It's a marble floor, we can clean it up.
Her fucking head was caved in.
So I didn't fucking do it!
So I didn't fucking do it!
She's got bondage burns on her wrists. There's blow all over the room, Moore looks like he went at it with a mountain lion. This room looks like the Manson Family stayed here a month. Micheal goes down, we all go down.
Wrap her up in blankets. Bring the car around to the back of the hotel, throw her off the balcony, put her in the car...Done.
You don't think someone will have a problem with a body being thrown off a balcony?

The reality is, you take away the horror of this situation, take away the tragedy of the death, take away the moral and ethical implications of all the crap you have had conditioned, beaten, into your head since grade one. What are we left with? What? A 115 lb. problem. 115 lbs. that must be moved from point A to point B. Now, a
Sun rises at 5:52.
I'm not wrecking the transmission!
Wait. Wait a minute.
What?
What?
We can't do this.
We can't do this.
We've already done this.
We've already done this.
No, I mean the suitcases. We can't bury them in suticases.
How do you figure?
According to Jewish law, the blood and limbs are considered to be part of the human being. They must be buried together or their souls won't rest in peace.

That is absolutely not true.

Well what the fuck are we supposed to do?
Well what the fuck are we supposed to do?
Open the suitcases, unpack the body parts and reunite the limbs.
We have to get going.
I am not flexible on this.
I am not flexible on this.
Alright. Let's do it.
Now I am the last to say that we have done here is a good thing. It's not. It's not a good thing. But it was, given the circumstances, the smart play. We did what had to be done. And...well...I'm proud of us. I'm proud of each and every one of us. We performed. Under the most complex and nerve shattering of situations, we
We are all going straight to hell. Either hell or prison, whichever comes first.
We are all going straight to hell. Either hell or prison, whichever comes first.
Wrong. That is flat out wrong. Hell is for cowards, for hypocrites who fear to live by the strenght of their own convictions. This is war. Given the circumstances, and given the fact that we are alive and they are not, we have chosen life over death. Two wrongs don't make a right. So our conviction and execution would only mean more death here,
Boyd you idiot, the shit's coming down!
What does that mean?
What does that mean?
You got us into this mess.
You got us into this mess.

You got some mighty fucking fine bad timing Adam. We got a rehearsal situation here.
I don't give a damn.
I didn't do anything! I'll turn your pathetic ass in!
Adam! Calm down.
Adam! Calm down.
I won't calm down. I can't do this. We can't do this. It won't work. It will not work.

All right. Let's all go back in. Adam? You're cool right?
No. I'm not Boyd. I am not cool at all.
Don't snap at them!
They're driving me nuts!
They're driving me nuts!
They're singing.
Honey, go in there and get some Starbursts.
What?

They're screaming for Starbursts.
They're screaming for Starbursts.
Later.

They're screaming like monsters and it's giving me a headache. Go get some fucking Starbursts.
Where's the candy?
There is no candy!
There is no candy!
What do you mean? It's it's a Goddamn Mini-Mart?!
We'll be ready Adam.
I know you'll be. Three hours.
That's one idea.
No...we want padded chairs...okay?
Real times.
They've all been real times. And as you prepare to enter into a new phase of life, as you prepare for new roles; father, husband, teacher, you will, as I have, come to except the letting go of of old ways. Soon, the mellowing will begin...
No. No. No. It's what my father said to me. He said it and he meant it... He said to me...He said, Adam, he said...He told me and I heard him... he said... Hell he said so many Goddamn things I can't remember everything he said for Christsake.
Right! That's exactly what I'm saying. My father said, first of all, I'm your father not your friend. I'm your father.
Right! That's exactly what I'm saying. My father said, first of all, I'm your father not your friend. I'm your father.
Are you solid with that?
Are you solid with that?
No. I think it's fucked.
No. I think it's fucked.
Then fuck what your father said, cause I'm gonna tell you right now...You'll know what it's all about, why you got married and why you love her when you wake up at three in the morning, and the streetlight's coming through the window and it's just catching a corner of her face, like a sleeping angel. And her hair smells sweet and she's your's.
The bucks gonna stop right here. If my son doesn't know the six New England states, if he has trouble with geography, I won't stick it in his face. I'll help the little guy. I'll put him in the car and take him out there. I'll take him to Maine for a big Lobster dinner, go skiing in Vermont, hot dogs at Yankee Stadium...I
Don't ever stare him down.
Don't ever stare him down.
I won't do it.
I won't do it.
Don't eyeball your kids.
I tell mine that they're little men. I tell them they're strong. They make me feel joy. I let 'em know. So they really know that I need them just as much. You know. Just as much man. And you know, you're their godfather...
I know and I'm honored...
I know and I'm honored...
If anything ever happens to me...
If anything ever happens to me...
I know...
I know...
Y'see? That's the real point here. That's what I'm driving for, when the big storm comes and knocks down all the forests and the rocks fall down and the leave's are bare. What's left? The little trees, the little fellas that the storm didn't see. The tiny little...
Either side you idiot. I'm calling 911.
What happened? Oh my God...
No way.
It has to be done.
I want you to hear me out.
What.
What.
You and I have done nothing. You especially. We are innocent.
You and I have done nothing. You especially. We are innocent.
I don't think so.
I don't think so.
We are. We go to the police. We tell them the truth. Now. Before they find out. Now. We save ourselves.
Have you thought about what I said?
Jesus Adam, can we not get into this now please?

Where's the bathroom?
My god.
There's more.
Money?
Yes money. Adam had a five hundred dollar Term Life Insurance Policy.
Yes money. Adam had a five hundred dollar Term Life Insurance Policy.
What does that mean?
Actually, no. Adam was switching to a Whole Life Policy, but re-scheduled his medical exam...and failed to make his last payment...so his Term Life lapsed. So it's value is null and void. Now he did have a pension account, worth another 150 thousand.
Well, oh...
Well, oh...
And a house. Valued at 350 thousand.
And a house. Valued at 350 thousand.
So where's that leave us?
So. When is the wedding.
Tomorrow. We are getting married tomorrow.
What are you talking about?
Don't sweet lip me.

I don't understand where this personal attack is coming from...

You're a liar. I want to know what happened in Vegas.
You're a liar. I want to know what happened in Vegas.
Nothing happened in Vegas.
Nothing happened in Vegas.
I don't want to hear it from the liar. Stick a plug in it Boyd. Fisher? What happened in Vegas?
Micheal? Do you have something to tell me?
Micheal. Tell Lois that nothing...
Micheal. Tell Lois that nothing...
Shut up Boyd! Micheal?
He's upset about Adam. We're all upset.
I will call the police right now if I don't start getting some answers.
I will call the police right now if I don't start getting some answers.
Lois please.
What is it?
Ah, yeah, hi. Is Tina there?
What?
I'm with Tina. Is she there?
She's not here.
Where is she?
Where is she?
She's here. She's just...Hold on a second.
Okay. Hi.
So who's the lucky guy?

Who?
Who?
The groom?
Yup.
Doing the bachelor party thing?

That's right.

She's in the bathroom...she's still working.
She's in the bathroom...she's still working.
She's still working?
She's still working?
That's right.
That's right.
Sweet deal.
Is everything okay?
Great. Fine. Perfect.
She's in there!
I'm just gonna let her know I'm here.
No I don't.
Fish?
Your investment ideas never work out.
That's the whole point. They rarely work out. But on occasion they do. And when they do, they do big.
I don't think so Boyd.
Fine. Don't come crying to Boyd. No sir.
But not tonight.
Not tonight.
Keith Richards, Dean Martin...
Jack Kerouback, Herman Melville, Henry Miller and Hunter S. Thompson. I dedicate this evening to fear and to major loathing. So from sun set to sun rise, let me be heard...
Where do you look? What side of the neck?
Left side.
He's right.
We can take her out to Red Rock. Find some quiet place...and put her in the ground.
I got her arm.
Here's his head.
The past is the past. Today is the beginning of the rest of our lives.
Today is the best day of the rest of our lives.
What's your fucking point?
I'm not talking to you?
What's goosed?
What is her disposition?
He just had two.
Give me two more.
He's too drunk.
He's fine. Okay Mikey, let's go. You guys stay here.
You said that Boyd.
Well, I didn't mean it.
Tony? This is Keith Fisher. You're doing my wedding and I'm calling about the chair situation. Yeah, I'll hold.
Who's up for making some real money?
Not really. Yes, the Fisher wedding chairs...
Prison Communication Systems. An acquaintance friend of mine is professionally involved with a communications outfit in Denver that I just happen to know for a fact is about to be rewarded a very large, exclusive contract to rewire every state prison in Colorado. Yes sir.
No, I'm holding for Tony. In chairs. Keith Fisher. Okay.
That would translate to government guaranteed contract in excess of 35 million dollars.
That would translate to government guaranteed contract in excess of 35 million dollars.
We need padded chairs.
We need padded chairs.
Or a stock kick of approximately 125% on shares which are currently sitting around $4.38, or, in plain English...
She's all your's Fish. Anything you want. Happy bachelor party.
I can't.
Oh, Jesus...call the police.
No.
No.
She's dead. Call somebody!
She's dead. Call somebody!
Shut up.
Shut up.
Call 911.
Call 911.
Shut up.
Fuck! Fuck you fucking guys!
Well we can definitely call the police. That's an easy call. If we call the police...What happens? They find a dead prostitute in the bathroom...They ask us...What happened? We say, ah...our friend, Micheal... Your brother...got a little out of control...they were making love...and he got a little excited...and he, ah, sort of beat her head into the side of a toilet, while he choked
Oh for Christsake Boyd. Somebody must know she's here.
Nobody knows.
Oh God. This is insane.
What's insane is the fact that Micheal here put a fucking girl's head through a toilet. That's insane.
Nobody knows she's here.
Good God...Good God...
All right people. New plan. Not even a new plan so much as a modification of the old plan.
I'm calling the police.
I'm calling the police.
So help me God you touch that phone and I bury you with them. Surrender is no longer an option. I repeat - It is not an option. Is there anyone who does not understand that?
That is a load of shit. Personal power has nothing to do with any of this. Tony Robbins has helped me to unlock energy and see my options more clearly, yes, but to give him credit for this, for all of this...Well that's just more than the man deserves.
I think we should say some words over the grave.
I think we should say some words over the grave.
What kind of words?
What kind of words?
I'm talking about prayer.
I'm talking about prayer.
Go ahead.
Micheal, now is probably not the best time for this.
No, this is the perfect time. This is real time. Adam. Your brother and I, as well as several others present, have always suspected that you... ...are a fully repressed, living in major denial, locked down, fly-boy butt-fucker.
It goes; "Today is the first day of the rest of our lives."
However it goes, the point is, nobody says anything to anyone ever. Right? ...Right?
Fisher had a less than normal relationship with that Donkey.
You always were a jealous man.
The problem was our quarterback had trouble remembering his right from left...
No, the problem, as I recall, was the lack of blocking...
OK. Definitely not cool! Definitely inappropriate behavior here.
Shut up Boyd.
Shut up Boyd.
Negative. This is not what we have worked out in terms of presented behavior.
Negative. This is not what we have worked out in terms of presented behavior.
He's having a problem here.
Easy Boyd.
No easy Boyd! I got a best friend in there in pieces. How about a little sensitivity?
He's cracked up.
He is not cracking up.
He is not cracking up.
Boyd...What have we done?
Boyd...What have we done?
What did you ask me?
What did you ask me?
What?
What?
What is the question you asked me?
What is the question you asked me?
I said, what have we done?
I said, what have we done?
Yes, you did. Now that is the question! That is exactly the question we should be asking ourselves. You tell me Fisher. What have we done?
Yes, you did. Now that is the question! That is exactly the question we should be asking ourselves. You tell me Fisher. What have we done?
I don't know! I just want to get married.
I don't know! I just want to get married.
Say it again.
Say it again.
What?
What?
What you just said. Say it again.
What you just said. Say it again.
I just want to get married.
I just want to get married.
Exactly! Exactly my point.
What's your point?
You want to know what you are doing here?! You are love pumping. You are protecting all that is sacred and beautiful and in sync with poetry and sunsets and little newborn babies. You are walking the walk. This is it Fisher, the real stuff. You love this woman. Love is second to nothing. I love you. I love Moore. I love Micheal. This
Regarding what?
Does she sound pissed, scared, hostile? Did she mention the police?
Does she sound pissed, scared, hostile? Did she mention the police?
No, but she's definitely pissed and hostile. And she's clearly starting to think that's something's not right.
Jesus Boyd you're going to O.D. him.
Suck my ass.
After you drop the kids off, take Micheal home. Put a few drinks in him so he'll sleep.
I don't think that's such a good idea.
I don't think that's such a good idea.
Just do it.
Just do it.
What are you going to do?
What are you going to do?
Take care of business.

What does that mean?

I don't know...
I don't know...
You got a nasty side to your thought process.
Okay. Here's the deal and it's a good one. Lois is cool. It's a pacified situation.
What does that mean?
I'm talking about Lois having relaxed her anxiety. Only deal is...you still got Micheal there?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Good deal. Lois just wants to hear it from Micheal.
Good deal. Lois just wants to hear it from Micheal.
Hear what?
Hear what?
That it was all an accident. She wants to hear it from Micheal's mouth.
That it was all an accident. She wants to hear it from Micheal's mouth.
Now?
That's right.
Isn't it a little late?
Isn't it a little late?
Hold on a sec. Lois, you sure you wouldn't rather do this in the morning?
This is a situation that defies judgement. We have acted and showed courage that is not of a kind known by most.

Blood money. Insurance dollars that you have thus fucking far decided not to tell me about at all. In no way have you mentioned that money. And I find that to be very very offensive.
You're sick.

Dad used to bring home these sparklers to me and Adam. Out back we'd light 'em up. The three of us. We'd hold 'em up to the sky and watch the explosions of light. Sparks. And dad would be all... "Get ready"..."watch for it"..."here it comes," here comes the "wahoo".
The wahoo?
The wahoo?
The sparkler would burn hot, then hotter, then even hotter...and there would be one moment of pure burn when that little fucker would cook just perfect. Perfect. It would only last a second, but that second was it. It was it. That's what dad had us looking for...You get me?

I appreciate it. I do, but...Maybe you ought to just ease up om yourself a bit.
No. No. No. This is my doing. You see I'm gonna have my wahoo spark for my own. For Lois and the kids, for my brother, for Franco. I'm gonna turn myself in. I am all that. I'm gonna do it for sweet Lois.

I'm saying it's luck. All luck. You work your entire life, all the training, focus, all the dedication, all irrelevant. Where does the ball bounce? My father spent his whole life trying to start a company, practiced every day, worked like a dog, finally got enough money. He's paid the dues, he's ready, does all the market research, picks his shot - "Pup Corn."

Pup corn?
Pup corn?
That's right, "Pup Corn." Doggie treats. Little snacks for dogs. He's figured it out. There is a hole in the market and he's going to fill it. Spends all our money, works himself into not two but three heart attacks getting this shit up. After fifteen months, the big day arrives, the first box of "Pup Corn" pops off the belt. He comes running
There.
Where?
Yeah?
I think there's a lot of truth in that. I'm gonna pursue some options. I want to join that Big Brother thing.

That's a good one.
That's a good one.
I want a black one. A little black brother. That's a big problem it seems to me. Lack of racial integration. That's a big one. You think?
I think you'd make an excellent Big Brother.
That's what I'm thinking.
Well that ought to be about the end of that.
Yup.
We don't say "love, honor and obey" anymore. And we don't say "till death do us part." Today we say, "respect, honor and cherish, as long as you both do love." How does that sound?
I kind of like "till death do us part." I mean, this is forever. In sickness and in health, through good times and bad. Honey, what do you think?
We don't think so. I mean, we just want the singing when I come out.
Okay great. What will that be?
Okay great. What will that be?
We're just going to have the leader of the band sing alone with his guitar. Acoustic.
We're just going to have the leader of the band sing alone with his guitar. Acoustic.
What song?
What song?
"You Send Me."
"You Send Me."
Oh I know that. How does it go...
Oh I know that. How does it go...
You know, Darling you...you send me...Darling you ...You mend me. Honey, sing it for Judge Tower.
Liz do you take Fisher to be your beloved husband, to respect, honor and cherish him till death do you part?
I do.

Are you guys gonna fill this place with kids? You sure got room for them.

We're in no hurry. I think we'll take some time to enjoy each other, enjoy our freedom before we surrender ourselves to kids.

Take your time. I wish I had.
Take your time. I wish I had.
We will.
We will.
So where to on the honeymoon?
Smart. Smart. Smart. Think big picture, take your time. I wish I had.
That's our plan.
That's our plan.
Well, I just need your signature on these contracts and a deposit check so I can get the ball rolling.
Good times.
Drum banging real times.
She's dead.
It was an accident!
Fucking desert.
Fish, I'm really sorry. I just...I owe you man. Desert.
Right.
That's right.
Shut up Micheal.
I KILLED MY BROTHER!
You see for me it's over. Over baby. I'm gonna turn myself in. After the wedding of course. After the wedding. Out of respect.
I don't think that's a good idea.
I don't think that's a good idea.
I said out of respect. Respect for you Fisher. For you and your wedding and your beautiful bride. There will be no more rain. You see where I am here?
I'll come to you tonight.
No, the children sleep with me.
No, the children sleep with me.
Give them to Refugio.
Give them to Refugio.
No, I don't want to because they yell. And I've got news for you too.
No, I don't want to because they yell. And I've got news for you too.
Then I'll get you in the fields tomorrow ...
Keep quiet. These miserable brats only get in the way.
You'd like me to kill them?
Didn't you say you know how to make vanilla pudding?
Yes, yes.
Stop this, stop this.
Let me go, Don Amalio, I'll tear her apart.
Where's the camera?
It's a present from my parents.
So much the better. We'll all fit. How many floors are there?
Two.
Two.
Are there many windows?
Are there many windows?
Lots. It's got balconies and two big towers.
Lots. It's got balconies and two big towers.
Then it's a respectable house.
When I wasn't so miserable I used to sell pigs. Begging your pardon, I was more honest than my holy Mother.
So you didn't come from the poorhouse!
No, miss. Smoking makes him spit and feel ill.
Smoking makes me feel ill? It's these filthy fag ends. I won't mention in this company what's upsetting you.
They've got a real hen house here! You can't hear yourself speak.
Tell me the answer to this! What bird lays eggs in a barn?
Don Amalio!
What's that?
What's that?
Enedina and Paco ...
Enedina and Paco ...
What about them?
What about them?
They're playing games behind the couch ...
Which couch?
That one.
Take me there.
Really, Don AMALIO, there's not much point in making a fuss.
Yes, Uncle. How are you?
I'm well ... The bus was late, wasn't it? ... What was the journey like?
I'm well ... The bus was late, wasn't it? ... What was the journey like?
Excellent. What a charming, peaceful place, Uncle.
Excellent. What a charming, peaceful place, Uncle.
You'll think you're still at the convent.
How long are you staying?
A very short while, Uncle. I've been given permission to stay only a few days.
A very short while, Uncle. I've been given permission to stay only a few days.
Was that difficult to get?
Was that difficult to get?
No. Mother Superior told me to come.
Did you have so little interest in seeing me?
To tell you the truth, not very much. I cannot lie. I respect you and I am grateful to you because I owe you everything materially, but otherwise ...

You have no feelings toward ...

No.
You've been neglecting the farm, Uncle.
In twenty years the grass has invaded everything. There are spiders all over the house except on the first floor. I hardly ever go out.
Come down here, you scamp.
Who is she?
Who is she?
My maid Ramona's daughter. She's a little animal.
My maid Ramona's daughter. She's a little animal.
Come down.
How like your aunt you are, even in your walk.
I know, Uncle, you've told me that already.
I know, Uncle, you've told me that already.
You see, even the voice.
I'm going to make you a nun's cake. It will make your mouth water.
You are spoiling me too much. I won't know what to do with myself when you've gone.
You are spoiling me too much. I won't know what to do with myself when you've gone.
Only because you want it.
What do you mean?
Nothing. I didn't say anything.
How did you know about that?
Oh, some years ago I heard my mother talking about it. But is it true?
Oh, some years ago I heard my mother talking about it. But is it true?
Yes, it is.
Yes, it is.
Don't you ever see him?
Don't you ever see him?
Never.
Never.
How could anybody behave like that?

Sometimes these things happen because of inexperience. Sometimes it's because of...

Evil.
Evil.
And what do you know about life? When all is said and done you couldn't possibly understand.
His mother wanted to keep him. She came from a poor family. I was in love with your aunt. I would like to have acknowledged him but I was afraid of losing her. That's why I didn't say anything.
And this innocent child.
And this innocent child.
Don't worry. He won't be forgotten.
You must think I am a monster.
No, but what a pity life is like that.
No, Uncle; ashes mean penance and death.
Then it's penance for you who are going to be a nun; and for me, who am old, it's death ...
If you like, I will come with you tomorrow to the village when you leave.
Thank you, Uncle.
This evening we must do something special by way of a farewell.
Whatever you like.
I should like you to do something for me. It's an innocent sort of thing but I'm very set on it.
Today I can refuse you nothing.
How strange you are! When I asked you to do this favor for me you refused. You seemed almost offended. And now, here you are, making me so very happy all of a sudden. Thank you, my child!
I don't like masquerading, but as you see I decided to give in to your whim.
You must think I'm mad.
No, Uncle, and now I'm pleased to have been able to do this favor, because, although I didn't think so at first, you are really a good man.
If you only knew ... When I was young I was full of idealism. I wanted to do something on a big scale for others, something to show my great love for humanity. But as soon as I tried to do something about it, I became afraid that I would be laughed at and I felt like a fool ... and so I went
Wasn't that cowardice?
Wasn't that cowardice?
No, it isn't that, I can assure you. I wouldn't be afraid in the face of real danger. I've proved that to myself. On the other hand, if a stranger visited me simply to say hello, I'd be alarmed.
Uncle, you mustn't think that I won't be sad to leave you.
It's up to you entirely. Don't leave, then ...
Unfortunately ...
It's my fault. If I'd come to see you more often, if I'd invited you here for holidays, maybe everything would be different.
It's my fault. If I'd come to see you more often, if I'd invited you here for holidays, maybe everything would be different.
Maybe ...
Yes, I don't want you ever to leave this house.
You must be out of your mind. I've been so happy these last few days -- now you've spoiled it all.
Leave us alone, Ramona.
Don't go!
You're lying.
No, it's true. Last night when you were sleeping, I had you all to myself.
Think about it. Don't hurry. Think it over.
Go away! Leave me alone.
Let me pass!
You must listen to me before you go.
You must listen to me before you go.
I've listened to you long enough. Let me out.
All that I said just now was a lie. I said it so you wouldn't leave. I only molested you in my thoughts ... I can't bear to have you leave me, hating me like this. Tell me you believe what I'm saying and I'll let you go.
You disgust me... even if what you say is true.
You disgust me... even if what you say is true.
Then you won't forgive me?
Leave me now. You can go to bed.
Yes, sir. Good night.
Why don't you ask her to stay on for a few days?
I have asked her but she's ungrateful. Sometimes I feel like hitting her. When I talk to her about the convent, she turns to stone.
Sit down, I'm going to need your help.
What's the matter?
Sit down, woman, sit down. You like me, don't you?
I'd be really ungrateful, if I didn't like you, sir; you took me and my little girl in when I didn't know where to turn.
I'd be really ungrateful, if I didn't like you, sir; you took me and my little girl in when I didn't know where to turn.
Yes, yes, but there's no need to bring that up. How far are you prepared to help me?
Yes, yes, but there's no need to bring that up. How far are you prepared to help me?
Just say the word, sir, and I'll do anything.
Why don't you speak to her, Ramona? Women are good at that sort of thing. Think of something that will make her stay a few more days. You are kind, Ramona! Speak to her. I know I don't need to offer you anything, but, if you're successful in this, I'll not forget you or your little girl.
But sir, what can I say to her? And why should she pay any attention to what a servant tells her?
The way she looked at me, Ramona! She hates me now. I think I've made a great mistake. She's going away, she's going away and nothing will stop her.
Speak to her again. Explain everything to her seriously.
Speak to her again. Explain everything to her seriously.
What for? She'll only look at me that way again ... I couldn't. You go. Perhaps she'll listen to you. Try to convince her.
What for? She'll only look at me that way again ... I couldn't. You go. Perhaps she'll listen to you. Try to convince her.
But what can I say to her, sir?
But what can I say to her, sir?
Tell her I lied, that I didn't take advantage of her.
You believe me, don't you?
Yes, sir.
Don't lie. You don't believe me either.
It's only that ... It's all very odd, sir.
What will the lady say?
She won't even know.
She won't even know.
If everybody agrees, but to make a roast takes four hours.
Is it all right?
Yes.
Yes.
Enedina's going to take a picture. So we'll have a souvenir.
They told us you'd be back tomorrow ...
I didn't want to do it, Don Jorge. They made me ...
How much is that?
Fifteen yards.
Fifteen yards.
That's fifteen by seven?
That's fifteen by seven?
That's it.
That's it.
Good.
Have you thought of what you want planted yet?
The fields have been left so long; with a good manuring anything will grow.
The fields have been left so long; with a good manuring anything will grow.
It's for wheat. We've always grown maize in the strip above the vegetables.
It's for wheat. We've always grown maize in the strip above the vegetables.
And in the vegetable plot?
And in the vegetable plot?
That's good land.
Hold on, Ramon! Is there time to make another trip?
No, sir, it's nearly six o'clock. Okay, let's get a move on! When are you leaving?
No, sir, it's nearly six o'clock. Okay, let's get a move on! When are you leaving?
Tonight, but I'll be back tomorrow afternoon.
Me?
Come on, miss. Just so the Virgin can be really pretty.
It won't take but a minute. It's a votive offering for a lady who was cured just when she was dying of fever. Our Lady of the Helpless granted her a favor.
Do you have great devotion for the Virgin?
It's very good.
Thank you; but it's missing something.
Thank you; but it's missing something.
That doesn't matter; I like it.
My God, what have you done to him!
He was asking for it.
He was asking for it.
But why? Why?
Ramona! Ramona!
Quiet, my dove. Quiet, or I'll ...
Not in that way; you're always looking for company.
Why do you say that? Perhaps the young girl is a bit jealous.
What's the matter with you?
Nothing.
Nothing.
Why the bad temper?
Why the bad temper?
It's Viridiana. She's getting on my nerves.
She's mad.
No, not mad at all: she's rotten with religion.
No, not mad at all: she's rotten with religion.
Let her do what she wants. She doesn't bother us in any way. She minds her business and we ...
So, Ramona!
Run and get something to mop it up with, quickly.
If you wake first, wake me up.
What are you going to do?
What I do every day, but I want to do it earlier.
You're happy, aren't you!
Shouldn't I be? You, on the other hand ...
I'm bored. I'm alone all day and I don't know what to do.
I'm bored. I'm alone all day and I don't know what to do.
You should have enough to do in this house ... Come here and listen to this.
What are you thinking about?
That your cousin is more to your taste.
She isn't my cousin.
It doesn't make any difference what she is: you like her.
How in hell does it wind up?
I think I'd better go tomorrow.
I think I'd better go tomorrow.
Don't be a fool! Why rush away from something which couldn't happen?
You see how much you like her?
That's life. Some people are brought together, others are separated. What can we do, if that's the way it happens?
Maybe afterwards he'll let me ...
If you free me, you'll be a rich man ...
Me, rich? Come on!
There's plenty of money in this house. Piles of it.
I don't want you to untie me. Kill him and then I'll give you the money.
Where's the dough?
Where's the dough?
Kill him and I'll tell you. If I don't keep my word, you can kill me too. There are thousands of pesetas. Kill him, idiot!
Kill him.
That will teach you not to bother me any more, you son of a bitch.
He was very good. Better than some people would think.
Why did he kill himself?
I don't know, sir.
One shouldn't be alone the whole time. I'm not like him, am I?
And this chest?
There are some curtains and drapes, but they're all very old.
I don't know; I can't remember. But I'm sure he loved you.
Why?
Why?
You wouldn't be here otherwise.
You wouldn't be here otherwise.
These chairs are in good condition. With a little varnish and some new covers this one will be quite presentable.
I don't know -- they've always been there.
That's stupid! Plaster! It can still be used.
Miss Viridiana ...
Are you Jorge?
Jorge, Don Jaime's son, at your service.
I've been expecting you; I got a letter from the lawyer.
Jorge. You frightened me. What's happening to you?
It's about time we spoke to each other, isn't it?
It's about time we spoke to each other, isn't it?
Well... is it so urgent?
Well... is it so urgent?
If I wait until tomorrow, it'll be the same as yesterday and the day before and all the other days. When you're not with your poor people, you're praying or you disappear, I never see you.
I don't know anything about these things, Jorge ...
But you have a right to let us know what you think.
But you have a right to let us know what you think.
I'm not interested. Do what you think's best.
What do you know about me?
I know that you used to work with an architect.
I know that you used to work with an architect.
And do you know that my mother and I had to suffer? If my father had bothered himself a little more about us, I'd be an architect now.
I don't understand how you can like being alone so much.
I'm not like you, you have your wife.
What are you doing here? Get out.
Leave him alone.
Leave him alone.
You won't get much done with those people. Those times are over! You ought to let me kick them out.
You won't get much done with those people. Those times are over! You ought to let me kick them out.
Do they worry you that much, then?
Do they worry you that much, then?
They worry me a great deal, and especially because of you.
There's no point in helping some of them when there are so many others.
I know perfectly well how little I can do. What I want to do is give passing beggars a roof, some food, and a bit of human warmth.
I know perfectly well how little I can do. What I want to do is give passing beggars a roof, some food, and a bit of human warmth.
Is that all you're going to devote your life to?
Is that all you're going to devote your life to?
I'm not sure yet. I've had a shock recently, and I'm only beginning to get over it. Perhaps I'll go back to the convent one day.
Are they going to work here too?
Don't worry. Nobody's going to disturb you.
Don't forget the meeting with the lawyer. The car will pick you up tomorrow morning.
I'll be ready.
I'll be ready.
Do you intend to stay here for some time?
Yes. Why?
You can come and live again in the big house if you want. Now that I'm alone, I can settle down anywhere.
And ...your friend?
She's left.
She's left.
Is she coming back?
Is she coming back?
No.
No.
Why?
It's for people!
Then let him go and he'll follow you.
Then let him go and he'll follow you.
And let him get run over by somebody else?
He's good at rabbiting and he knows it. When we're in the country, if he doesn't hunt he doesn't get fed.
How much do you want for him?
How much do you want for him?
I wasn't thinking of selling him, but if you want ... I'll leave it to you.
And remember, the less he eats, the better he runs.
What's he called?
What's he called?
Canelo!
They're varicose veins, miss, but some days I can't take care of them.
Are you sure it isn't contagious?
Are you sure it isn't contagious?
They told me it isn't at the hospital.
They're varicose veins. It isn't leprosy.
I'll take him to the doctor tomorrow. Come on now, sit down and go on eating. And you, look after him as if he were a sick brother. Be understanding. Now finish eating and then go to bed. Everyone in bed by eight o'clock!
How are you today?
Things seem to be getting better.
Things seem to be getting better.
Hold your arm out. You can't hope to be cured quickly. You heard what the doctor said. If it had been seen to in time ...This'll take time. But with the help of God, we'll pull through.
Are your parents alive?
Parents? Nobody cares a damn, what's the use of them!
Parents? Nobody cares a damn, what's the use of them!
Don't say that.
Don't say that.
Right, I won't say that, but I still think they're no use.
You'll soon find out, you liar!
Stop this!
Stop this!
He's lying through his ass!
How do you do, Miss Viridiana!
Is anything the matter, Mr. Mayor?
Is anything the matter, Mr. Mayor?
You cannot leave ...
You cannot leave ...
Why not?
Why not?
There's been an accident.
There's been an accident.
Where?
Where?
Come with me.
Why are you crying?
I'm afraid.
I'm afraid.
Don't invent stories; go to bed.
Don't invent stories; go to bed.
A black bull came.
A black bull came.
A black bull!
It's a very big one.
Very, very?
Very, very?
Yes -- very, very big!
Yes -- very, very big!
He couldn't get through the door, then?
He came in through the cupboard.
You little liar! Get out of here!
I'll box your ears if you don't show some respect for the dead! You mustn't play under this tree.
Don Jaime loved to watch me skip.
Have you repaired the windows of the dormitories?
They shut all right now. And the blankets are ready.
What's going on, Moncho?
This louse is looking for trouble.
In you go! Moncho, lead the way! You stay here.
But, miss ...
You have decided to leave, Moncho.
Yes!
Yes!
I can't do anything to make you stay? These people annoy you, isn't that it?
Mother?
I've just had a letter from your uncle. He won't be able to come when you take your vows.
I've just had a letter from your uncle. He won't be able to come when you take your vows.
All right, Mother.
I hardly know him. I saw him only once, some years ago. I can't even remember him.
In any case he's asking you to come and stay with him.
In any case he's asking you to come and stay with him.
I don't want to leave the convent, Mother.
I don't want to leave the convent, Mother.
I'm afraid that his health is not good. He's your only relative and you ought to say farewell to him before taking your vows. You will certainly never see him again.
But why does he want to see me? He has never bothered about me.
He has paid for your studies and your maintenance, and he has just sent your dowry. Does that mean so little to you, Viridiana?
I have no desire to see the world again, but if you order me to...
The retreat will start soon. You can leave tomorrow morning.
Good morning. You weren't expecting me, were you?
Mother.
Ever since yesterday, when we heard by chance about the tragedy, we have been very anxious for you. Why didn't you write? I would have come immediately.
I had so many things to think about!
I had so many things to think about!
A suicide is horrible. I know. But you should have told me.
Is there some grave impediment which prevents you from taking your vows? There must be something.
I have nothing to reproach myself for. All I know is that I've changed. With all my strength, which is not much, I will follow the road that the Lord has shown me. One can also serve outside a convent.
I have nothing to reproach myself for. All I know is that I've changed. With all my strength, which is not much, I will follow the road that the Lord has shown me. One can also serve outside a convent.
Are you aware of the pride there is in what you're saying?
Forgive me if I have offended you.
You are forgiven. Goodbye.
Give the little girl to me. Come here, sweetheart. Are you ready?
When you are, miss.
When you are, miss.
Good, then let's go!
Don't talk like that!
I'll talk the way I want to. I've had enough of this.
Would you mind telling me what I did wrong to you to deserve your insults?
I've had a gutful of this.
I've had a gutful of this.
If you want to stay you'll have to exercise a little self-control, and be a bit more humble to everybody.
She has the face of an angel. What a pity you can't see her.
Right, let's go. And keep the compliments to yourself. I don't like them.
What about you, Manuel?
I'm only good at making people laugh.
I'm only good at making people laugh.
That's all right; we all laugh here, but not at you; I'll see to that.
She looks like a sick marrow!
Don't pay any attention to him. It's very good.
Ask the priest, miss.
That's enough. Go join the others, and don't come back here. And you'll have to control your temper.
Welcome, miss. I'm Ramona, Don Jaime's servant.
Ah! Pleased to meet you.
How do you feel?
I have a headache.
I have a headache.
That will soon pass. It's nothing.
What happened to me?
You fainted last night after supper. The master and I carried you here.
You fainted last night after supper. The master and I carried you here.
Have I slept long?
Have I slept long?
Oh, you slept well; don't worry.
Hello.
Hello.
Good morning, Rita. How are we today?
Today, a good girl.
Today, a good girl.
Could I trouble you for my glass of milk?
What?
Yes, yes, I saw you!
How did you see me?
From the terrace.
From the terrace.
It's very wicked to spy. Why did you do it?
I'm going to the hen house. Are you coming with me?
No, I don't want to.
) Daryl Lindenmeyer was only here briefly, one semester at most. But he was singularly the most brilliant student I ever had in a classroom. He created programs so beautiful, so lyrical, they were almost like symphonies...
Can you tell us what's on the disc?
Can you tell us what's on the disc?
) There is one program with approximately 1.3 million lines of programming. It is thoroughly secured, which is not surprising considering Lindenmeyer created it.
In English, please.
I accidently triggered a protection mechanism which erased the entire program.
It was very wellhidden. There was no way to see it until it was too late.
It's not your fault. We appreciate you trying.
It's not your fault. We appreciate you trying.
Look, I feel bad about this, so I'm going to try to look into the programming of his Maestro teaching tool for you. ) I've had one sitting around for years. Maybe I can learn something that you'll find useful.
You son-ofabitch, I'm going to kill you.
Me? What did I do?
I'm sorry, I thought you were somebody else.
I've discovered something about Lindenmeyer'5 Maestro teaching tool I thought you should know... The harm done to the music students who used the device  it was not by accident. The machine was designed explicitly for that purpose. Lindenmeyer intended to hurt the kids using it.

My first two pairs of convicts suffered the same fate.
Why wasn't I told?
We don't know how, but Sid 6.7 made himself into an android.
You mean a nanotech synthetic organism.

Catch him and your record's clean.
This is the newest technology approved for general implementation. It's called a locater implant. Every parolee gets one. We're going to know where you are every second for the rest of your life.
If you try to run, I'll hunt you down and kill you myself.
If you try to run, I'll hunt you down and kill you myself.
Yes or no, Mr. Barnes?
There's already a task force out looking for Lindenmeyer. Every other officer in the city will be hunting Sid right along with you.
But only you will know he's not human.

You already have staked your reputation. Mayor Bennett and I have been friends a long time. Since Grimes tried to kill him, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to come to the conclusion that Sid 6.7 might go after him, too. Bennett's Re-Election Rally is tomorrow night and we already have enough trouble on our hands with one psychotic on the loose. The fail-safe
You all right?
Why'd.. .you pull me out?

Donley started experiencing the attack for real. If I hadn't gotten you out, the same thing would have happened to you. You may not believe this, Parker,

Before you, nobody else had gotten close enough to Sid 6.7 to take a shot at him. Hell, nobody else had even been able to start tracking him before he got to them first. New scar  you making it okay in there?

Name was Clyde Reilly. Hardware specialist. LETAC surveillance cameras got a picture of the perp as he left the building.
Jesus Christ. Can you kill it?
If you can catch him.
She's going to help you understand what makes Sid 6.7 tick.
What she's going to do is get in my way.
This is the personnel file on the programmer, Lindenmeyer. There might be something in it you can use.
She wasn't part of the deal, Cox.

Then I guess we're even.
When this is over, will you get this goddam thing out of my head?
On my life, I promise you I will.

If you're lying, I'll hunt you down and kill you myself.

Any sign of Lindenmeyer?

There is no way Parker killed those guards. No way.
I think we both know who did. What's so urgent?

I need your help--

I don't set policy. You have the key?
Give me 30 seconds, then flip every switch you can reach.
Got it.
Ms. Deane, you wanted to see me?

That's also where Mr. Barnes lost his arms to Mathew Grimes' booby trap. What's your point, Dr. Carter?
Letting a lunatic like Parker Barnes loose in the free world is like lighting a fuse. At some point, he will go off -- you saw what happened in the simulator. The risk to the public is unacceptably dangerous.

I understand the risks involved here. But there is nobody better qualified to go after Sid 6.7 than Barnes. And, there is nobody who knows him better than you. If a situation becomes volatile, you will find a way to quell it. I have complete confidence in you.
I watched your simulation, Mr. Barnes. Very impressive. You know, you're the only one to ever go up against Sid 6.7 who is still alive.
Only because I got pulled out early.

Nobody else ever got anywhere near him. Nobody else... understands him like you do.

Lindenmeyer developed neural connectors that tap directly into the nervous system. If the simulator isn't calibrated properly, experiencing death in this level of VR is like experiencing death within a dream. The experience becomes real.

I was assured the problem was corrected.
It makes me nervous just seeing him in a uniform. I will never forget the first time I saw the photos from the crime scene.
Neither will the public. The media has caught wind of his pardon. Unless Mr. Barnes starts giving me some tangible results, I'm going to put him back in his cage.
You embarrassed me in front of the highestranking law enforcement official in the country. Do you have any idea how much money you just cost me?

Then why don't you start practicing and keep your mouth shut for a while?
Don't get out of the car.
Stop me.
What the hell's going on?!
This is my area of expertise.
What did you do to those people?
Nothing.
Being on the street's a little different than sitting in an office all day, isn't it?
Enjoying yourself?

You know I am.

This isn't a game, Parker!
This isn't a game, Parker!
Tell him.
What's the problem?
I'm doing the best I can!
Whatever he was doing here was only the start.
Start of what?
Start of what?
I don't know, yet. What we do know is his performances are increasing in scale, not decreasing. Whatever it is, he isn't finished...
It's not just Sid 6.7's performances that are increasing. Stars need bigger and bigger audiences. Whatever Sid is going to do next, it's going to involve media.
You like baseball?
Real effective security...
You could have just flashed him your badge, you know?

Parker - stop! STOP! Don't make me shoot you
If you're gonna do it, better do it now.
Grimes is back! He's back! He's come back!!!
No! Grimes isn't back. He's only one part of Sid. Sid 6.7 is a hell of a lot worse than Grimes ever was. Get a hold of yourself!
We know you didn't kill those guards.
They're going to fry me for it, anyway.
He didn't know about the neural toxin. I did.
You knew the entire time? Can you give me one good reason why I shouldn't kill you right now?
How did you find out about the toxin?
Sid 6.7 told me after he killed the two guards. He suggested I kill you rather than him.

I was wrong. And I was wrong not to tell you Grimes was part of Sid. I should have told you. I won't make the same mistake again.
The rally's a little obvious as a target, don't you think?
I told you before, Grimes liked to be obvious.
I told you before, Grimes liked to be obvious.
Sid 6.7 isn't Grimes.
Sid 6.7 isn't Grimes.
Part of him is.
If we find Sid, Lindenmeyer won't be far behind.
Think he's keeping track of his creation?

That, or living through him...
See something?
I'm not sure...on the bridge...the guy at the payphone...
Nice work.
Thanks.
Find out anything?
A bomb's going off tomorrow night, but I have no idea where.
Can I ask you something?
You mean there's something you haven't asked me?
You mean there's something you haven't asked me?
You've already fulfilled the terms of your pardon. You stopped Sid 6.7 and you've got his module. You're free to go  right now. Why are you going to do this?

That's why I'm asking.
Because this painintheass criminal psychology expert has helped me understand what I'm capable of. And what I'm not. And better than anyone else, I am capable of stopping Sid 6.7.
You okay?
...I think so...You?

More or less.
More or less.
Lindenmeyer?
Lindenmeyer?
My guess is dead.
My guess is dead.
Sid?

I don't know.
Where the hell are you going?
Lindenmeyer never got over wanting to kill kids with more musical than he had...
How's your pulse?
I couldn't tell you.
I couldn't tell you.
Then shoot him already.
Then shoot him already.
Duck!
What do we do now?
You won't want to watch. Turn around.

I must make them very nervous if they let you out of prison. You know, we have so much in common  we have such history together I've been thinking we should become friends.
You and me have nothing in common.
Who else do you know who touches the world with synthetic hands?
You...mother...fucker! I'M GOING TO KILL YOU!!!
Now, is that any way to talk to an old buddy? I mean, just because I'm carrying around the joy of killing your family inside me doesn't mean we can't be friends.

DEAD! YOU HEAR ME?
DEAD! YOU HEAR ME?
You really are pathetic, you know that? Mathew Grimes is only one letter in my alphabet. He is nothing compared to me.

No sir, that would've been illegal...
Sure...relax sport, no one's gonna blow a whistle. Here, is this legal?...you wanna put it in my account?
Mr. Gekko -- thank you for the chance. You won't regret this, you're with a winner.
...put the rest of it in a money market account for now. I want to see what you know before I invest it...and save the cheap salesman talk, it's obvious.

Excuse me sir.

Mr. Gekko, I don't think I can...go on.
Mr. Gekko, I don't think I can...go on.
...finish out the game, Bud, push yourself...
Nice club, Mr. Gekko...
Yeah... not bad for a City College boy. Bought my way into this club and now every one of these ivy league schmucks is sucking my kneecaps...I just got on the Board of the Zoological Society, cost me a million; that's the thing with WASPS -- they like animals but they can't stand people!

Uh, Mr. Gekko, we took a little loss today. We got stopped out on Tarafly... ...about 50 thousand.
I guess your father's not a union representative on that company.
What? How do you know about my father?

Sir Larry Wildman. Like all Brits he thinks he was born with a better pot to piss in... bribed an old secretary of mine to open bar mouth and stole RDL Pharmaceuticals right out from under me. Wildman the white knight.

I remember that deal. You were involved?
Revenge is a dish best served cold... well, it's payback time, sport. ... see that building? I bought into it ten years ago. It was my first real estate deal. I sold it a couple of years later and made an $800,000 dollar profit. It was better than sex. At that time I thought that was all tne money in the world... Now, it's
I don't understand.
I don't understand.
Wildman's in town. He just became an American citizen. Something big's about to go down. I want to know where he goes and who he sees. I want you, sport, to give me the missing half of the picture...

Follow him? Mr. Gekko I... It's not what I do. I could lose my license. If the SEC found out, I could go to jail. It's inside information, isn't it?

Inside information. Oh you mean like when a father tells his son about a court ruling on an airline? Or someone overhears me saying I'm gonna buy Teldar Paper? Or the chairman of the board of XYZ suddenly knows it's time to blow out XYZ. You mean that? I'm afraid sport, unless you got a father on the board of directors of another company,
What about hard work?
What about it? You work hard. I'll bet you stayed up all night analyzing that dog you bought. And where'd it get you?... my father worked hard too like an elephant pushing electrical supplies. And he dropped dead at 49 with a heart attack and a tax bill and the bank pissed on his grave and took the house; my mom ended up working
I got all I could get which was 750,000 shares plus 5000 March 50 calls. Average price of $47 a share And $4 per contract for the call. I just wish I could've got more.
Don't expect to get it all, sport, you'll burn out. First rule of business is never get emotional about stock, clouds the judgment. Where do we stand?
I'll be right there, fix them a drink.
...we have 37.2 million invested. At this point, we're up 3.1 million and some change. If it goes to 75 bucks we can clean close to 12 mill.

Sorry, Mr. Gekko.
Allright. Wait here...
I guess I'll head back...
Stick around... Larry, one of my "gang" -- Bud Fox.
The break up value is higher. It's worth 80.
But we don't want to be greedy now, so let's let him have it at $72.
He's right. I had to sell. The key to the game is your capital reserves. You don't have enough, you can't pee in the tall weeds with the big dogs.

Money never sleeps pal. When I came in in '69, they traded six hours a day, now the clock don't stop, London's deregulated, the Orient is hungrier than us. Just let the money circle the world, sport, buying and selling, and if you're smart it comes back paying. I just made $800,000 in Hong Kong gold. It's been wired to you -- play with

...Gordon.
Yeah, I'm gonna make you rich, Bud Fox. I'm gonna make you rich enough you can afford a girl like Darien. Remember, power is the best aphrodisiac. This is your wake-up call. Go to work.
Got him at an auction in Kentucky.
How much?
How much?
Close to two million. But this sucker can go all the way to Devon and the nationals.
The art of which is deception. Spread the buy orders through different accounts and you won't get burned...
I think I got some friends that won't mind making some easy money...
Mixed emotions, Buddy: like Larry Wildman going off a cliff in my new Maserati. Men as smart as myself have got their asses handed to them on a sling with the airlines, fuel could go up, unions are killers...
Yeah aren't you forgetting something Gordon: rule one, capital reserves. This company has $75 million cash in an overfunded pension. That buys us a lot of credibility... ...and the beauty is you already own close to two percent of this sucker...
Gordon what I want--and I never asked you for anything--is to be your co-pilot on this. I want to take this airline, turn it around, and make it work. It's gonna make us a fortune!
I'm talking to a stockbroker who wants to run an airline. It's gonna take me two years and 2000 headaches to turn Teldar Paper around, what do I need this dink airline for? I'm up to my ass in more nuts than a fruitcake.

What does that mean?
What does that mean?
The three unions. It's 43% of Bluestar's operating budget, the hourly cost of a flight crew is $850 an hour, that's the real hidden value G.G., if you can negotiate that out, get a crew down to $350-400 an hour a run, this airline is gonna be the hottest thing since Texas Air...

Alright... Susan, get Buckingham on the box. I want him to look at it. And tell Jock Taylor at Thwick, Jensen... So sport, the falcon has heard the falconer...tell me more...
And I'd like to introduce you to Mr. Gekko, and his lawyer, Mr. Salt.
A pleasure to meet you, Mr. Fox.
Now, wait a minute, Dad...
Sure. What's worth doing is worth doing for money. It's a bad bargain where nobody gains. And if this deal goes through, we all gain.
I didn't know we had a meeting schedule for this morning.
I'm sorry, this can't wait.
What the hell do you want?
I found out about the garage sale down at Bluestar. Why?
Last night I read Rudy the story of Winnie the Pooh and the Honey pot. Know what happened: he stuck his nose in that honey pot once too often and got stung.
Maybe you ought to read him Pinocchio. You told me you were going to turn Bluestar around. Not upside down. You used me.

It's all about bucks, kid, the rest is conversation... Bud, you're still going to be president. And when the time comes, you'll parachute out a rich man. With the money you're going to make, your father won't have to work another day in his life.

Buddy, it's not a question of enough. It's a zero sum game, sport. Somebody wins and somebody loses. Money itself isn't lost or made, it's simply transferred from one perception to another. Like magic. That painting cost $60,000 10 years ago. I could sell it today for $600,000. The illusion has become real. And the more real it becomes, the more desperately they want

Believe me, Buddy, I was gonna discuss this with you at the right time. Look, why don't you calm down and come to the apartment for dinner tonight. Bring Darien...
...I can't make it tonight.
...I can't make it tonight.
Are you with me Buddy?
Gordon, it's two minutes to close. What do you want to do?! Decide.
Dump it.
Hello Bud.
Gordon.
Gordon.
You sandbagged me on Bluestar. I guess you think you taught the teacher a lesson, that you can make the tail wag the dog, huh?
Hello again, I been holding these drinks for us for the last three weeks.
Excuse me.

Not really. I'd say that Gordon is one of the most astute collectors around. He has a great eye and he only buys the best. Like this rug for instance, a silk Tabriz, the finest of its kind. The day after he bought it in London, a dealer representing the Saudi Royal Family offered him twice what he paid. It absolutely makes the room.

Oh it's just a rental. I'm moving to the East Side soon. I've got a couple of deals brewing with Gordon. but that's just conversation... what about real things? Like dinner. The two of us. Friday. Cafe. Santo Domingo.
What if I have a previous engagement?
Break it.

You know, the elevator man couldn't believe I paid $300,000 to have my walls looking like this, he's got them for free in Brooklyn.
I'll bet he's got an opinion on the stock market too. This apartment is already ahead of its time. I call it the "demolished" look. They've already heard about it at House and Garden and they're coming next week to photograph it before it gets... lived in. Is that alright? I'd love to have it in my portfolio.

Sure... But your fee... considering you're way over budget, should be negotiable.
Let's get things straight, Bud. I'm not going to take a cut. I worked hard and you can't decorate a room in New York for less than $100,000. Curtains alone...
I'm kidding, I'm kidding, we're still young, Darien. So what's money anyway when everybody's making it, it's all relative. After all, this is not the house in Connecticut, this is just a crash pad good for a couple of years...before we slip our two lovely kids, Yuppie and Fruppie into the Lycee Francaise.

That's right -- one with high yield, rich assets and no downside...
Do you think you're ready?
It's not me I'm worried about...You know Darien, the only reason we haven't slept together is because we both know we will -- and not knowing when was the only surprise left. You owe me, I want you, what else is there...but you, me, the world. ...right here...make love to me...now... Stop me if I'm going too far.

...are you going to trade all night again? You got to go to work in a couple of hours.
...are you going to trade all night again? You got to go to work in a couple of hours.
You think I'm gonna broker the rest of my life... I'm going to be a giant, Darien, an entrepreneur in the Italian 15th century sense of the word -- a mover, shaker.
I love you, baby. Did I tell you that sometime in the last 24 hours?
Get in bed. Y'ever hear of the sixty hour work week? You're turning into a yuppie Frankenstein, you love money so much.
Sure, why not, money's the sex of the 80's. I never had it like you when I was growing up, baby, it wasn't the upper east side.
You're so naive Bud, you don't even know. Your dad took care of you. I might've been rich when I was a kid...but my father lost all his money...in the seventies, in the stock market, at the track. He was a lousy gambler...

Fear. The fear of being poor I guess, just like you, Darien... But that's all gonna change sweetheart. I'm catching the express... ... and you're going along for the ride.
I'm sorry. I was afraid something like this could happen.
Talk about being bent over the sink of life and being dry humped. I handed it to him on a silver platter. I told my father and those people...

I'm not gonna let it happen Darien.
Don't cross Gordon. He'll crush you. You've worked hard to get where you are. If Gordon doesn't buy Bluestar someone else will; and who's to say they won't do the same thing.
At least I wouldn't be pulling the trigger.
Are you mad! Why are you doing this! We're so close, the town is going to be ours. Don't throw away your future Bud!
I can stay with the brokerage firm. And you're doing fine. We can survive without Gordon Gekko.

What the hell's that supposed to mean?
You really mean that? What'd he promise you? To take you public? I guess without Gordon's money and seal of approval, I'm not such a hot investment anymore. You're just the best money can buy, Darien...
You're not exactly pure Bud, you went after Gekko with the same vengeance you went after me. Look in the mirror before...
You're not exactly pure Bud, you went after Gekko with the same vengeance you went after me. Look in the mirror before...
I'm looking...and I sure don't like what I see.
You may not believe this Bud but I really do care for you. I think we could've made a good team...but that's how it goes...
Get the hell out!
Hi.
Why?
Why?
I figure a guy who's made some mistakes should be able to understand a girl who's made some of her own...
How you doing Buddy?
Great Carolyn, doing any better would be a sin...
Morning Buddy, you look happy.
Any better and I'd be guilty.

Oh Christ!
You got a look in your eye, Mr. Mannheim... You got something for the small fry...
Jesus, can't make a buck in this market, country's going to hell faster than when that sonofabitch Roosevelt was around... too much cheap money sloshing around the world. The biggest mistake we ever made was letting Nixon get off the gold standard. Putney Drug--you boys might want to have a look at it.

Mr. Mannheim, got a sure thing. Anacott Steel.
No such thing Bud - 'cept death and taxes. Not a good company anymore, no fundamentals. What's going on Bud? Do you know something? Remember there're no short cuts son, quick buck artists come and go with every bull market but the steady players make it through the bear markets. You're part of something here, Bud. The money you make for people creates science

You're on a roll kiddo. Enjoy it while it lasts -- 'cause it never does.

I thought this was an informal meeting. What's he doing here?
Harold, you don't mind strolling around the block a couple hundred times, do you?
Frankly, Carl, I can't see giving much more. If you have any suggestions I'll be glad to listen.

No, it's a prophecy. The rich have been doing it to the poor since the beginning of time. The only difference between the Pyramids and the Empire State Building is that the Egyptians didn't have unions.

Fine, if you don't want us, stay with the scum in present management--dedicated to running you and Bluestar into the ground.
...that "scum" built this company up from one plane in thirty years, they made something out of nothing, and if that's a scum I'll take one over a rat any day...

Those days are over, Gordon. They were over a long time ago.
Those days are over, Gordon. They were over a long time ago.
Can't blame me for trying. You look as beautiful as that painting I just bought.
So what's the problem Sunshine? You look like Black Thursday. Bad case of puppy love?

You told him about us?
No, are you crazy? And I don't want him ever to know. Do you understand?...
I want to ask you a big favor, Gordon. Please drop the Bluestar deal.
Now tell me, why would I want to do that?
Now tell me, why would I want to do that?
Because I don't want to see him hurt.

You and I are the same, Darien. We're smart enough not to buy into the oldest myth running: love... A fiction created by people who got nothing to keep them from jumping out of windows.

You're really twisted, Gordon. You're incapable of giving to anybody because deep down inside you there's a poverty that every last dollar in the world won't fill.
You're really twisted, Gordon. You're incapable of giving to anybody because deep down inside you there's a poverty that every last dollar in the world won't fill.
Ooh ooh, tough talk from a scared little girl all wrapped in a pretty grown-up package. Does this mean you're ready to cut the umbilical cord and step out into the world on your own? Because, Darien, if you're through with me, you're through with everything I'm a part of.
Yeah, Billy, who's your buyer?... No, not interested. Ollie, start calling a the institutions, start with Marx at Janson Mutual, then Reardon. Get me that California retirement money, baby! And we're on our way!
You got it, G.G.
He respond to the offer? What? What the hell's Cromwell doing giving lecture tours when his company's losing 60 million a quarter? I guess he's giving lectures on how to lose money...if this guy opened a funeral parlor, no one would die, this turkey's totally brain dead...Well Christmas is over and business is business. Keep buying. Dilute the sonofabitch. Ollie I want every orifice
He's flowing, Gordo. Piece of cake.
... just got 250,000 shares at 18 1/4 from Janson, think I'll pull twice that at 18 1/2 outta the California pensions. We got close to half a million shares in the bag.
Hey, the Terminator! Blow 'em away Ollie.

Rip their throats out and put them in your garbage compactor. Interesting. You got a card?

No. This time I'm in for the long term. This is not a liquidation, Gordon. I'm going to turn it around. You're getting a free ride on my tail, mate, and with the dollars you're costing me to buy back the stock, I could modernize the plant. I'm not the only one who pays here Gordon. We're talking about lives and jobs; three and
You must be wearing a mask you're laughing so hard behind it Larry. Let's cut the "sir" crap. Correct me if I'm wrong, but when you took CNX Electronics, you laid off 8,000 workers, Jessmon Fruit about 6,000, that airline...
I could break you, mate, in two pieces over my knees, you know it, I know it, I could buy you six times ever, I could dump the stock just to burn your ass but I happen to want the company and I want your block of shares. I'm announcing a tender offer at 65 tomorrow, and I'm expecting your commitment.
Considering you brought my mother into it, $71.50.
Done. You'll hear from my lawyers. 8 a.m. Good night.
With all due respect, Mr. Gekko, what's to prevent you from doing the same thing?
Cause I have a way around all this, a way we can all make money and make this airline profitable again. What do you say we cut to the chase. I'm asking for a modest twenty percent across-the-board wage cut.
Are you prepared to put that in writing?
I'll have a letter of agreement drawn up within two days.
Cards are on the table. What do you think?
If you mean what you say, I think we're in the ball park. I'll take it to my people.
We know what you're up to, Gekko, and let me tell you this from here, you suck eggs, mister, over my dead body you ain't gonna break up Bluestar.
You guys must know something nobody else knows. If those are my plans, it's the first I've heard of it.
Listen, you clowns, there's somebody else out there trying to buy your airline, if you want to be Pac-manned and gobbled by Atilla the Hun be my guest!
We'll take our chances. Nice to see you again, Mr. Gekko.

Must be what we came for. The four stand slowly and enter through the doors, which close behind them. They begin walking around the WAXWORKS, which appear gruesome. The first they spy is of a high school student with a letter jacket on the verge of being hacked with an axe by and angry woodsman. They give each other looks of disgust and continue

I've had some kind of "empty-nest" episode where I saw some things that weren't there. Let's deal with that. I'm willing to deal with that. I just don't want to go conjuring problems where none exist.
Of course. You must be so proud.

I couldn't catch my breath. That's not a metaphor, that's...And I panicked. I never dreamed anyone would hear me back there... I tried to leave him. Went to my mother's in Boston. He brought my things up and pleaded with me to come home.
You must think I'm pathetic.
No. No, I don't.
No. No, I don't.
I'm sorry that I frightened you like that. But I was so touched by your concern. I've been lonely here. Perhaps we could be friends.

You look a little old for a student.
I'm not. We...we met at a party.

In the window. Norman's at work.
I don't...
Wow. I'm losing it.
No, you're not. But a presence in your house is not something to be taken lightly.
Sit down here.
Are we hoping the ghost is going to have to pee?
Place your fingers on the planchette.
The planchette?
The planchette?
This.
We wish to commune with the spirit of Mrs. Feur. What's her first name?
I don't know.
Nothing's happening.
Shhh.
Oh...
M-E...
Mef? What's Mef?
It's initials. F is Feur. It's her.
I have to go.
Jody, wait.
Are you okay?
I think so

I'm sorry for leaving, but I mean, Jesus, Claire...
I'm sorry for leaving, but I mean, Jesus, Claire...
It's alright.

I mess around with this stuff, but I never thought anything would happen.
Does Norman know?
Jody, she's alive.

No. Jody, listen to me. You have to listen to me. This is not something that I can do right now. Whatever it was, it's gone. I need it to be gone now.

I've got to find a bathroom. I'll call you.
Oh God...you knew.
I was down in Adamant...

Artsy little village down seven. There's a guy there who sells my work. I had just dropped off some paintings and as I got in my car...I saw Norman sitting at this little cafe.
I started to walk over...but he wasn't alone. A blond. I only caught a glimpse. She was young. I should have said something right away. But I didn't.
Why?
Why?
Partly because I didn't want to hurt you...but partly...partly because I was relieved.
Partly because I didn't want to hurt you...but partly...partly because I was relieved.
Relieved?
Relieved?
I had just been left by Richard. I was bitter and miserable and for some fucked up reason, it made me feel better that your life wasn't as perfect as it seemed.
By the time I finally got up the nerve to tell you, Stan called from the hospital and it was too late.
Too late? Jody, it was an accident.
Too late? Jody, it was an accident.
Alone? On a two lane road? With a ton of Valium in your system?
I got there first. Stan covered up the pills and I had it out with Norman. He seemed desperate not to lose you. He promised to handle it. And we all let it drop away.
All of us.
I'm a terrible friend.
No.
How could I expect you to tell me something that I wouldn't even tell myself?
What are you going to do?
What are you going to do?
I don't know.
I don't know.
If she was dangerous before--
If she was dangerous before--
She could have hurt me if she wanted to.
She could have hurt me if she wanted to.
You don't know that. If it's your belief that gives her form, then you've got to shut her out. Somehow you have to break the connection.
You don't know that. If it's your belief that gives her form, then you've got to shut her out. Somehow you have to break the connection.
No. She wanted me to know the truth. Now that I do...I think she's at peace.
Jody, she tried to kill him.
I know.
I know.
I can't believe this is happening.
I can't believe this is happening.
We need help. Please let me call the medium.
We need help. Please let me call the medium.
That could take days. I need to do something now. Don't you see? She wants us dead.
Alight, alright. Stay calm. You opened this door. There's got to be a way that you can close it.
Like what?
Like what?
I have an idea. But, I mean, I'm just making this up...
I have an idea. But, I mean, I'm just making this up...
What is it?
But he acted like he'd never heard of it.
Did he say that?
Did he say that?
Jody he was lying.
Jody he was lying.
What if he was? Do you think he wanted to bring that up again just when you're trying to make a new start?
What if he was? Do you think he wanted to bring that up again just when you're trying to make a new start?
I guess not.
I guess not.
He's trying to put it behind him, Claire. You should too.
You've got a beautiful life. And even with this, it's always been clear that he loves you. I've come to think that's all that really matters.
I don't know...
I don't know...
Trust me, Claire. You hear something... change the subject. You find something... get rid of it, throw it in the lake. You know what happened. The rest is only details. And no one's ever glad they got a hold of those. If you want to put this back together...just let it go.
Christ, that's twice in...When did they move in?
I think three...
I think three...
Three weeks.
What's their name?
Feur, I think. Psych department. Figures. They're all psychotic.
She's awake.
We'll be quiet. Quick and quiet.
When's she out of here?
Norman Spencer.
Alright. I can't take the rejection. I'm going to class.
Don't.
Don't.
Claire, I have to show up for the--

To tell you the truth...I'm excited.
You are...

To get my life back. To have some time for myself. Some time for us.
You did a great job. She's a good kid.
We did.
It's just us now.
I know.
Tired?
Nope.
Nope.
Wanna fool around?

Yup.
Did you...

Not like this. We were never like this. I want to go over there. After dinner, we can--

To make sure she's all right.

Is it gone?
Hi.
I'm stuck here for another couple of hours.
Oh.
Unless you need me to come home...
Unless you need me to come home...
No, no. It's fine.

Huh? Absolutely. Take your time.

In the house. I was scared.

Of course.
It was there. This angry music all by itself. And I heard whispering.
What kind of whispering?
What kind of whispering?
I don't know. Just...whispering.
I've got the conference next week. I want you to feel safe.
I do, I do. I'm sure I'm just...how was your day?
Think I may have cracked it.
Really?
I think so. Maybe.

Norman...
Norman...
What can it hurt to talk to someone?
Claire, she's been a huge part of your life for seventeen years. If you weren't thrown off balance by this, then something would be wrong.
I never said I wasn't upset. Of course I'm upset. I miss her terribly. But I know what I saw and what I heard...and it wasn't some "symptom" of something...

No! Not sweetheart, no. I believe in what's happening. I don't want to, but I do. I guess I was foolish enough to think that would be enough for you.
Keep your voice down.
I will NOT.
Maybe you're right. Maybe I'm losing my mind...
Claire, please...
I'm sorry...
Then where is she?
...I'm pulling up, Yuri. I'll see you for dinner. Sure you won't stay?
No, it's fine. I'm fine.

I tried to break it off!
You should have tried harder.

Claire...
Claire...
Get out of my way.
She was damaged and unstable. The more I tried to distance myself, the more desperate she became. Finally, she showed up at the new house...
How did she know where it was?
She did it.
We don't know that for sure.
We don't know that for sure.
Of course she did, Norman. What else could it be?

IT'S TRUE. That's...you have to believe me! Oh God, I'm telling you the truth! I did what I had to, Claire. She was gone. There was nothing I could do for her. I did...I put her in the lake. I rolled the car in...and I watched it sink. And I've lived with that image ever since. I couldn't just stand there while everything-- my
Mmmuh...
Shhhh.
Shhhh.
Mauduh...
What?
MADISON!
:What, you're doing Darcy? Since when?
:No, I said, I hate what I'm doing to Darcy. Oh, boy, men are stupider, it's true.
:No, I said, I hate what I'm doing to Darcy. Oh, boy, men are stupider, it's true.
:Would you stop it!
:Would you stop it!
:Well, they are.
:Well, they are.
:What do you mean "They" are? Are you officially a woman now?
:What do you mean "They" are? Are you officially a woman now?
:Oh, I wish. A woman wouldn't have screwed over the woman she loved. No, they don't think that way.
Many times over the past thirty years. Why he shows himself to me, I don't know but Lasher's not some mindless wraith.
Then what is he...?
Then what is he...?
A spacial entity. An organized energy. something that precedes our definition of existence.
Going away doesn't mean you leave Lasher behind. He was on Rowan's deck - and the plane... geography seems irrelevant now.
Michael - you loved that house as a child. You could work again! You could make it ours. We'll sweep out the horror. And Lasher with it!
Thank you for this honor, my dear.
You've been shadowing the family for thirty years. It's only fitting you give one af us away.
You've been shadowing the family for thirty years. It's only fitting you give one af us away.
I've grown very fond of you you and Michael both.
I have seen him again. Last night.
But you've not told Michael.
Lasher will act, Rowan. Whatever it is he wants - he's waited three hundred years to have it. facing him alone... I don't like -
Lasher is my legacy - not Michael's. Aaron, I've seen the pain in Michael. I can't bear to see anymore. He's not to know. Swear to me.
Are you alright...? You look pale.
I wish everyone would stop commenting on my health. I'm the doctor.
There are two.
Two what...?
Two what...?
Two heartbeats.
With his hands!
But why would they do that...?
You've always said you felt goodness in them - that the witches brought you and Rowan together. Isn't that right...? They're reaching out to you, Rowan!
But it doesn't make sense. They - they used Lasher... they conspired with him.
But it doesn't make sense. They - they used Lasher... they conspired with him.
Who can say the hope of redemption dies with our last breath...? They must see what the legacy has wrought - Diedre, withered inside herself Carlotta, killing and stunting her own flesh and blood... surely they sense the child you carry - and the life it might lead in Lashers grasp... Maybe, in death, they feel remorse for the evil they embraced in life...?!
Jesus I've got - to get to the ho--
Rowan's already called the hotel, Michael. At the cemetery by now, I would guess.
How do you know about Rowan ...? I didn't --- Cemetery...?
With her family. Rowan's mother died yesterday.
With her family. Rowan's mother died yesterday.
Rowan's mother died at childbirth. And she doesn't have. any family.
I ask only that you stay here, long enough to be - educated. A few hours.
You sound certifiable. Yon know that.
I - r saw him as a child. Lots of times... But no one else did.
Come. There is a lot to read
A what...?
A spirit. Perhaps evil... ...and he has come to you- with Diedre gone - you've... inherited him.
No scaredy-cats in the Talamasca, huh...?
There is a difference between sensing danger - and being afraid. what defines you in the landscape, Michael...? what anchors your life...? Your work...? Your creativity...?

Rowan.
Rowan.
Then focus on how you feel about her. Because your feelings define you. Take off your gloves, Michael.
Don't tell Rowan about this.
Michael, Rowan should -
Michael, Rowan should -
NO! she's pregnant, Aaron. she's got that to deal with - and the clinic.. she is not to hear about this. don't you think I know she spends half her lite worrying about me... Listening to my heart, aren't you...? The Timex still ticking...?
What have the witches always asked of you...?
"Go back, Michael. Do what you can..."
"Go back, Michael. Do what you can..."
Yes - and you have. Do you see...? He was passing over into death - but the witches sent him back - to the one person they knew had the power to save him... and they gave him the power to show you what no one else could...
on't know what else to do. Maybe I just don't belong in her life. well - I'm already out of her life.
Nothing was ever more false.
Nothing was ever more false.
Then tell me. Is it Lasher....
I'll probably be back in a week...but I can't spend Christmas in that house. you'll check on her - every day...?
Every day twice.
Aaron - lieten to me... It's been Lasher - from the start!
What are you talk---
What are you talk---
He chose ME for ROWAN --- when I was a child!
Rowan...
You have to warn her - this second! I'm catching the next flight back!
Rowan - I'm Beatrice Maytair. Your cousin. Deedee...you'r mother and I - we - we grew up together.
I want to see my mother.
I hope Ryan explained that if you stay in this town, you're shackled with pushy relations for the rest of your life.
He made that quite clear, yes.
He made that quite clear, yes.
Gifford - that box glued to your hands...?
Aren't they gauche...? Those steel things are so - common.
Nothing worse than a common tool.
You two sees like a perfect fit. Only two mounths...?
Mm-hmm. Seems & lot longer.
Mm-hmm. Seems & lot longer.
In the bayou, they have a saying... 'You choose the music for the dance - but fortune picks your partner.' Darling, I'd say you're on a roll.
Always give the crovd a taste, darling. Now - Ryan said I'm supposed to make sure -
I don't want it.
'The heir to the fortune must wear the Mayfair pendant an her wedding day.' We should all have to suffer such burdens.
Then you wear it.
Then you wear it.
C'mon now - give a little nod to Mayfair tradition.
I'm sure he's alright, Bea. They'll find him somewhere.
It's over a month. The police say it happens all the time.
Down here. darling, we figure: If you're taking a trip to God knows where - might as well have one hell of a going-away party.
In certain cases, hell is the operative word.
In certain cases, hell is the operative word.
Giff - shuttup. you're mother was a sweet child, Rowan... A lost little girl in a world too full at things
You babbling that nonsense - now...? This is a wedding.
I'm not saying I believe it...but I heard it 'nough times to know somebody did. They made a deal with the devil. Y'know - "make us rich" - worship the number thirteen - the whole bit. And some stuff about 'bringing them all back through a door...'

I've waited for you - the one whose science could match her powers...

It was an accident. Gifford, too.
The portraits, Lasher. Why are the witches always before a door...? Tell me, Lasher. Now!
They want to come back. We have a pact - of mutual desire and consent. The Mayfairs ar. a beautiful tapestry. I have weaved you all together - from the start. I brought Petyr Van Abel to Suzanne. He had genius in him. Scientific, precise. It was a perfect start. And on it has gone - father to mother... sister to brother... father to

Always loved you. Rowan. Always...
They like you ------- kids.
I guess so. The trick is remembering how to act like one. I'm glad you called, Mr. Curry. I wanted to see you. Why don't we go to my office...
I've read the stories - and seen the news coverage.
'Freak at the week.' That's what the TV crew. call it- people come right to the house. They have a husband or wife who skipped town - or a missing kid- They bring a sweater or a toy - and ask me to touch it. so I can teel them where they are..
I don't remember you at all- You - you saved my life- Bizarre thing to say, isn't it...?
I'm glad you're around to say it.
I'm glad you're around to say it.
My jury's still out on that,
My jury's still out on that,
Then call it in. Mr. Curry. Whatever's happeninq to you - death is not the preferable alternative. I'm in the life business - remember..?
Do they keep everything 'out' ...?
As far as touching things, yes. But the vision - that keeps pouring into my head- It won't go away God - if I could just understand it.
What do you see...?
Nothing. Absolutely nothing-
Just one. The bar's closed.

I'll bet you say that to all the women who bring you back to life and then seduce you.
What else did you see- Michael...?
What're you - a mindreader...? Who was the man on the kitchen floor. ~.?
My uncle. Graham. He and my Aunt, Ellie raised me. He - he - had a stroke- Just before Ellie died - of cancer. Last year.
You knelt there, helpless- You couldn't save him. There was so such anger in you-. Death infuriates you...
It's unbelievable that you can do that.
It - it feels like - like I'm being filled up. crowded out of myself. Like I'm fading away-
My mother and I used to take long walks and make up stories about the houses and the people who lived inside. The Queen's house-. the Gangster's house-. the clown's house- Like that.
And whose houses do you design...?

Nope- My father died before I was born. My mother died in childbirth. El1ie was my only blood relation. so she brought me here... the day after I was born.
Too much... too fast...?
Mm-hmm. Scared- I feel a little like the moth and the flame.
He's very pleased with your response to the surroundings.
He fools around with his patients too.
you touched him --- and saw him...? What was he doinging. Kinky...?
It's come to that, huh...? Three weeks - and you need a psychic skin flick to perk up our sex life...?
You look very deep when you do that. It's interesting. We're Complete opposites- I'd never just sit and wait for insparation. I'd skip my turn and swap some letters.
Ms. yin, and Mr. yang Aha!

Seems more like a year than a month.

C'mon. Let's go to the ho---
He's in there! Or are you out for a stroll in the garden ...?! where are you, goddamnit...?!
Even if it's all true - that doesn't make you a witch! It's 1992, Rowan!
But it scares the hell out of you, doesn't it. Michael...?
Stop looking at me like that! I'm not some siren chanting to the moon. And my life is not a cosmic whim! I am in charge of my life - - and I want to stay. Everything that was taken from me is here, Michael. All these years, she was there without me. Helpless. I should have been here.

Yes. I love you. Very much.
I've come home, Michae1, for the first time. I want to stay here - with you.
It'd take mounths... and cost a fortune.
I'm soon to be a very wealthy witch.
What about your work back home...?
They need doctors in New Orleans too. Michael - think what I could do with the money!
I'll bet she had a wonderful smile.
Let's see.
You sure...?
It's the next best thing to being there' - right...?
Everyone - this is Michael curry.
Hello..
Hello..
Michael - this is Beatrice Mayfair. And this is her brother, Giff---

He can't hurt us, Michael. It's us - our love. He can't find a crack in it. He can't find a way in.

Then it's going to be 'I killed for sex'... Listen darling, why won't you let us use your real name for the features - if people knew that it was the ELLEN CARTER writing the features and not just some pseudonym - then we might shift more units. You haven't written anything in four years darling - I know you need this job -
OH MY GAWD!
I'm sorry - I didn't think
I'm sorry - I didn't think
A person could get killed round here just for working late

I thought someone was following me - I - er - I just needed my computer and some things...Listen, I'd like to work from home for a few weeks - is that OK?
Why don't you take a few weeks off - you're due some holiday time.

BRIAN...
BRIAN...
But - If you could show me round now - and I'll meet you later?

You don't know?
No - the police say I've killed fourteen - but I've not - I've killed many more. It amazes me how they just haven't found the bodies. What is society coming to when people just don't get missed. I agree, some of them are well hidden - I probably couldn't even show you where I put them - one girl, number eight I think

Where do you kill them...
Where do you kill them...
Oh anywhere - whenever I needed to - Do you know how easy it is to take them? You just pick up a hiker, or someone off the streets - they believe so easily you know, 'Look, I have something to show you' I would say - and that would be it. One girl, I think her name is Debbie - she had broken

my car I stopped working from my car. She could have stopped me you know - If she really wanted too. That is the difference between the confusion of humanity and the purity of the beast - If a dog attacked you - you could easily kill it without any damage to yourself - Why then do people get bitten by dogs - savaged?

I don't know
Because a dog will attack with a ferocity and force that we poses, but centuries of social contamination has run it out of us - that is what sets us aside from the purity of the beasts...Society is rotting - men who once were strong and kept everything working are getting soft - women are making them soft - by the time a pretty

You know everyone accuses me of being sick - the press, the TV - but I'm not you know - they are - I don't watch it for entertainment every night - I don't sit and watch it whilst eating my dinner - they all say, how could he cut her up? She was dead - I can't hurt something dead - And all
The press think that the WHITE ANGEL is a woman - why is that? Do you dress up LESLIE?
I don't want to talk about it -
I don't want to talk about it -
OK, the press call you the WHITE ANGLE because you only kill girls wearing white - why white - white clothes, blonde hair...

Let me ask you, why do you wear black ELLEN CARTER? What are you running from?
Do you feel sorry for the girls you have killed
Why should I feel sorry - they're dead.
How long have you been watching me?
I have something I have to show you...
Tell me about your wife...
My wife My wife was the only one who really deserved it. LESLIE do this. LESLIE do that. LESLIE it's your fault... She used to tell me what to wear, where to go, what to do - she mothered me...
My wife My wife was the only one who really deserved it. LESLIE do this. LESLIE do that. LESLIE it's your fault... She used to tell me what to wear, where to go, what to do - she mothered me...
then why did you marry her -
then why did you marry her -
It seemed like a good idea at the time - why did you marry your husband.
What didn't you like about her?
I hated being treated like a failure - looked down on - my sister used to do that - I hated it - I should have known, when we got married - in a registry office of course - she wore maroon - I just wanted a white wedding I think she thought I was a ticket to the good life. I had a
You are the first person I have ever told any of this to. We are birds of a feather ELLEN...we're in the same league
I don't think so...This isn't a game you know...There aren't points or leagues. Sure I killed my husband - but I am no killer.
I don't think so...This isn't a game you know...There aren't points or leagues. Sure I killed my husband - but I am no killer.
You've killed but you're not a killer
You've killed but you're not a killer
That's right...Don't ever think that you and I are the same - we're not even remotely similar. I did what I had to do for myself, for my own self preservation - not to live out some bizarre role playing fantasy. My husband was sick -
Tell me how it happened...
Why should I?
Why should I?
Why not? Please - it would help me
And how did it feel to be rid of him
Wonderful - like a great release - He was a malignant cancer and I had to remove him - the world is better without him
My mother...? I never knew my real MOTHER - I was adopted
Tell me about your adopted MOTHER
You think I killed my MOTHER don't you?
Did you?
No...I didn't do it...I wish I had but I didn't. I was beaten to it. STEPHANIE became my mother.
STEPHANIE?
STEPHANIE?
My sister - My ADOPTED SISTER -
My sister - My ADOPTED SISTER -
Did STEPHANIE kill your MOTHER?
Did STEPHANIE kill your MOTHER?
STEPHANIE loved me - she got some insurance money and took legal custody of me - she was just old enough. We had a ball for years - we could do anything, anywhere, anyhow...And we did...We would play games - she would be the executioner and I would be the convict - She would strap me into the arm chair and pretend to electrocute
What was your relationship with STEPHANIE?
It was wrong - all my life I have been cheated - cheated of anything good - I shouldn't have been born - I was a mistake - my natural mother was a whore - that makes me...
I want it to stop - it all to stop...
Then make it stop...
What?
I know this sounds insane ELLEN, but... Telling you all of this, writing the book... It feels good. Don't get me wrong - I feel like a weight is being lifted from my shoulders... When I tell you what I have done - I can't believe it is me...Yet I know it was. This is like a purging for me...

Psychiatrists would say that you are confronting your demons
Psychiatrists would say that you are confronting your demons
Demons... This wouldn't have been possible without you... You have given me incentive ELLEN - I can see clearer now...
What's wrong?
Nothing could be better...
What's wrong?
I am ashamed of what I have done ELLEN. When I read what you had written it made me think - look into myself - I haven't dared look into myself for a long time - I have stopped ELLEN, I can't carry on - I won't carry on. All I want is to start a new life - I want a second chance...You
What is it?
Open it...
Yes...
You want me to wear white for you? You must be madder than I thought...
You want me to wear white for you? You must be madder than I thought...
But ELLEN, I told you I have stopped...
But ELLEN, I told you I have stopped...
But for how long - what will set you off again? You'll be walking down the street and some girl will be wearing a white hat - and that will be it - back on the merry go round...
Where are you going?
Out - I may be some time
We've got nothing to talk about
LESLIE I'm sorry - I - I didn't know what to think
I thought we had a relationship built on trust - and you just slap me in the face...
I am sorry...
LESLIE? Is that good enough?
Yes - I suppose so...
ELLEN, would you like a cup - there's plenty in the pot
No thanks -
First finish your tea...
He doesn't need to...
Why did you let him in?
What was I supposed to do?
I don't like sugar
There isn't that much - you didn't even taste it - What's wrong - don't you like my tea?
There isn't that much - you didn't even taste it - What's wrong - don't you like my tea?
It's not that - I just don't want any sugar
It's not that - I just don't want any sugar
Why whats wrong with the sugar -
I haven't been using it recently LESLIE
CRAP! - I wish I had taken a photo of your face when I gave some to that DETECTIVE - What's wrong ELLEN - you look pale - maybe you have been eating the wrong kind of foods lately - it could be food poisoning?
whats wrong...what have I done wrong?
Nothing LESLIE - I just think we should wait...
Nothing LESLIE - I just think we should wait...
WAIT FOR WHAT!?
I don't want either of us to come to any harm - please...
You killed my friend!
I loved you ELLEN - why did you do this?
It's what you would do to me
Don't you want me now LESLIE
No - I'll have you after
I'm sorry, I couldn't - when is she due?
At 2.00...
Well, what do you think?
I don't know - it's your house ELLEN
I don't know - it's your house ELLEN
Yes - but you live here too - If it were your house?
Yes - but you live here too - If it were your house?
I think he's fine - I don't know why you have this thing about men - it would be nice to have a guy in the house for a change - I don't think he would hurt a fly.
What's wrong with you?
I would prefer it if you kept away from LESLIE
I would prefer it if you kept away from LESLIE
What?
What?
You heard me - keep away from him
You don't own him you know - you can't tell me not to see him!
Yes I can...
I want you out now
Leave!? Who the hell do you think you are?
Leave!? Who the hell do you think you are?
I'm your landlady

It's been what, three years?
What's this all about?
What's this all about?
So have you seen hubby recently ELLEN?
What brings the rats out of the sewers?
I'm here about the so called disappearance of your husband - It's best if we let old bones lie. Know what I mean? I'm working on the WHITE ANGEL case now - and I've got to check all known murderers or suspected murderers for the last five years... And that means you...So where were you last THURSDAY afternoon around five...

As it happens, I was at home alone - maybe we could solve each others problems?
As it happens, I was at home alone - maybe we could solve each others problems?
Get out...
I'd watch her mate - she has thing for men - they disappear near her.
I think you had better leave
I'm really very sorry - I was banking on this coming through, because it's only five minutes from my surgery...
Surgery? Are you a doctor?
Surgery? Are you a doctor?
No - a dentist
Just put it in my room
No worries
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to shout...
Don't worry about it -
You're a novelist - why didn't you tell me?

ANGEL...
Yes, sorry - He's here to make sure that you are alright
Come on, bro. Spare yourself the humiliation, the degradation...
You and your pep talks.
You and your pep talks.
Don't get me wrong. We can salivate over all the Christy Malones of our lives. Wishing we could devour them like melt-in-your-mouth filet mignon. But we're strictly hamburger guys. Ground chuck, sixty eight percent lean, is about the best we can hope for.

That's Charlie. My best friend. He's into beef analogies, partly because he's a butcher's son, and partly because, well, he's just into beef analogies. What can I say? He's also a photographer...
I genuinely think she wants me. I feel a vibe.
That vibe is from your wrist, pal. You've been over-tenderizing your meat, again.
See? Did you see that?
She smiles at everyone, Ted. She's like a newborn with gas.
The only chick more untouchable than Christy Malone is Miss April. "Hi, my name's Ginger. I love tofu burgers, rainy nights, and riding bareback. My biggest turn-off is cell phones during sex." Here's a tip: set it on VIBRATE, honey, and don't be stingy with the lube. Don't knock it till you tried it.
Were you always this sick?
Were you always this sick?
One thing for sure, Christy Malone ain't lookin THAT good naked.
Someday, I'll find out.
You have a better chance of being hit by a Mack truck with a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip.
I defy your hamburger theory of life, and all of the unfulfilled hopes and dreams it represents.
That's crazy talk.
That's crazy talk.
I defy any and all limits.
Don't do it, Ted. Don't do it.
Any time, any day, a man can completely reinvent himself.
Think about it...Long tunnel, bright lights, it's full of vaginal symbolism.
Poor Freud, turning in his grave.

Seriously, it's like we're being reborn. We really could reinvent ourselves here, just like you said. Nobody knows about your massive humiliation.

What are the odds of there being ANOTHER Ted Nelson on our flight?
Astronomical.
Who the hell was your father?
Well, Dad said...
...A bouncer? Are you serious?
Maybe he got promoted.
This is the life, baby. We get ourselves some tail and we're talking SPRING BREAK!
Cut it out, before you break something!
Cut it out, before you break something!
For a guy about to try his first Dom Perignon, you are extremely uptight.
Don't you know anything about limo etiquette? Everything in here is included for our pleasure.
Wait a second, I thought we were hamburger guys.
Wait a second, I thought we were hamburger guys.
And like every hamburger guy knows, when you get your one big chance at the good life, you abuse every second of it until they figure out you don't belong there and kick your sorry ass out.
I can't believe that's your mother. We're talking babe-a-licious chub fest, right here in the 501's.
Perv.
This is like my every wet dream come true. I don't even care that you're here, too, bro.
Be cool. Fake it if you have to.
I wonder how many of them will be at the orgy tonight?
This isn't some 80's porno film, you dip shit. There are no wild sex orgies.
This isn't some 80's porno film, you dip shit. There are no wild sex orgies.
Oh. Well. Maybe not yet.
Oh. Well. Maybe not yet.
Not ever. Never.
You kiss your mother with that mouth?
I'd kiss your mother with this mouth. I mean, if she wasn't, you know...
So far away? In Xenia?
Yeah, whatever.
Check this out. Hurry!
I better go, Dad.
Hurry.
What is it now?
What is it now?
Check it out!
Don't tell me. Another vision of incomparable beauty?
Beauty? No. We're talking GODDESS.
I get it now. You and me. We're dead.
Dead?
Dead?
Our plane crashed. In the Grand Canyon. A big fiery explosion. We never made it to L.A. They needed dental records to identify us. And this place. This. Actually. Is. Heaven.

Don't be such a pansy. All of this is YOURS.
It's a lot to digest. Imagine how you'd feel.
It's a lot to digest. Imagine how you'd feel.
I'd feel like staying up all night! Forever! Or at least till I got the LAY of the land, SO TO SPEAK.
I feel like I'm entering a forbidden tomb...
...where they get all the really good porno channels on cable.
Oh, how inappropriate is that!
Take a whiff of heaven.

How would you like it if I did that to your mother's panties?

I'd call you a sick, twisted fuck. But this is different. She wasn't your mother mother--

Give me those!
A couple of boys fighting over a pair of red silk panties is nothing compared to what he's seen.
Yeah, he's probably been serving cocktails, SO TO SPEAK, at the orgies.
You're late, bro!
Sorry. Ginger got a little, you know, enthusiastic.

You'll never believe who's in there.

It better not be my Aunt Trudy.
I feel like I've just been hit by a Mack truck.
With a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip.
I thought I loved her.
Chicks are like buses. If you miss one, don't sweat it. There's another coming 'round the corner.
Hell yes, all hundred and seventeen of 'em!
No, leave one. Somebody's grandmother might want one.

Brilliant! Molly, give me all you've got. For Merk.
Holy stinkers, what were you thinking?
We wanted to challenge the notions of classic beauty. We wanted to showcase women throughout the world.
We wanted to challenge the notions of classic beauty. We wanted to showcase women throughout the world.
Next time, make sure you put a barf bag in the centerfold.
You got everything you ever wanted.
Except the girl. The only one that really mattered.
Naked girls, wild sex, video games. No wonder it's called "Heaven."
This is a fun place...but we don't usually come here until after the orgies.
Never say never.
Oh, god. Look. Look.
Every one of these women thinks she should be the next Angel of the Month. It's your job, Ted, to decide which of them is right.
Let me get this straight...
Let me get this straight...
If it isn't straight by now, son, you probably should see a doctor.

If you don't have...I mean...
Teddy? Would you please please please take me to the prom?
SHUT UP! Are you serious? Of course I will...of course.
Ted, have you lost your mind?
You like me. I like you. I guess it's pretty obvious to everyone.

I don't LIKE you. We're JUST FRIENDS.

Oh, Ted, DUH. I smile at everyone since I got my braces off.

So you'll think about it?
You really don't get it, do you? I am genetically programmed to desire a big, buff, manly man who can defend and provide for me and my yet to be conceived offspring! It's, like, a caveman thing!
So that's a maybe?
So that's a maybe?
The answer is NEVER, Ted, NEVER. Except maybe in your dreams.
Great jacket, Teddy Bear.
Yeah? You like?
Yeah? You like?
Makes your shoulders look so big and broad.
Hi, Teddy Bear.
Christy? You want to be in "Heaven?"
Christy? You want to be in "Heaven?"
I turned eighteen over spring break. I'm eligible.
I thought I'd be nervous, but you sure know how to make a girl feel relaxed, Teddy Bear.
I do? I mean, yeah, I do.
I do? I mean, yeah, I do.
I have to admit, I am so totally turned on. We should do it. Now.

You know...take the pictures?
I remember the first time you walked into Mrs. Temple's class in 2nd grade. Blue gingham dress. Blond ponytail.
Which you pulled, hard!
Which you pulled, hard!
That was code for "I like you."
Remember dress up day? You and Charlie lifting skirts during recess.
I miss those days, when schoolyard sexual harassment was without consequence.

Well?
You have changed since second grade.

You expect me to think at a time like this? There isn't a drop of blood in my brain.
You expect me to think at a time like this? There isn't a drop of blood in my brain.
Oh, Teddy Bear, you're funny.
I was always too shy to admit how much I liked you.
Come on, I was hamburger. You were porterhouse.
Come on, I was hamburger. You were porterhouse.
Maybe on the outside. But inside, deep down, I've always been dripping with special sauces. Are you hungry?
God, you are so hot.
Then you better get in the water, before you get burned.
We have a truckload of strawberries arriving on Tuesday morning.
We own a small family grocery store.
We can't accept it. It's much too expensive. Right, dear?
Of course, dumpling. Its very nice of Ted but...
Sweetheart, what is it?
I always wanted Craftsman tools. He even got me the limited edition Buckeye colors.
I always wanted Craftsman tools. He even got me the limited edition Buckeye colors.
Oh, honey. We can't accept this extravagance.
Ted, we put a lot of love in our business.
We wanted you and Jimmy to have it someday. Something real and honest.
We wanted you and Jimmy to have it someday. Something real and honest.
We love our lives just the way they are.
You have to understand. This was a big shock, for all of us. One minute you're our little boy, of whom we could not be more proud. The next minute you're the owner of this whole pornographic empire.
But that doesn't make you the boss of everything, son.
But that doesn't make you the boss of everything, son.
Don't you see how your self involvement and lack of humility are affecting the whole family?
We're not ashamed of you, Teddy. We don't approve of the magazine or the models or the so-called "flesh parties" you attend. But we can get past all that.
We miss you. We miss our son.
We miss you. We miss our son.
We miss our family.
We think you should give up the magazine. Sell it. Let someone else run it. Whatever it takes.
We want you to go to college, find a career you love, marry a nice girl from a nice family, and live happily ever after.
We understand your disappointment, Teddy. Christy is a pretty, sexy, provocative, voluptuous... We...uh...we understand your disappointment.
It's my private business! Mine!
I remember spring break of my senior year. Seems like a lifetime ago.
Dad, please.
Dad, please.
Grandpa was so strong back then. Working from the crack of dawn. So proud of his peaches.

It was the year of the rhizopus rot. Grandpa almost lost the farm. You sacrificed your dream to go to the prize hog festival. And in the end you saved the peaches and you didn't have to slaughter your sow.

You guys are my parents.
Of course we are.

They didn't want me when I was born. Why should I care...
Son.
Well, why should I?
Well, why should I?
They had a rough life. Your father was a bouncer. Your mother was, well, a two-bit stripper. There was no place for a baby.

Just say it, Dad.

Well, good. Every little bit helps.
Finally, some gratitude.
We're grateful, Ted. It's not that. Those Craftsman tools...they're a dream come true.
But those are our dreams, son. We have to make them come true.
Consider me your fairy godfather, except without the fairy part. No more mealy apples and bruised bananas, ever, for the rest of your lives.
Sorry I--
It's okay. You need me?
It's okay. You need me?
Your mom said you've been ignoring your chores.
I paid off the mortgage! I ordered that Winnebago you always wanted! Now you're ashamed of me?
You ordered a Winnebago?
THAT is your dream, not mine. My dream is so far beyond anything YOU PEOPLE could even imagine.
Watch your tone, mister.
Watch your tone, mister.
Why don't you just admit what this is really all about? I'm not your real kid and you can't control me anymore.
Shut your pie hole, Jimmy.
I will not have my boys arguing.
I-I don't have the keys.
They're in the ignition, silly.
You do know how to drive?
I don't have much experience with a...uh...stick.

Hey, Ted. Wanna go shopping?
Shopping, really? I should tell my friend.

Don't worry. He found the chocolate room.

Hi ho, Silver.
Who exactly ARE you?
What do you mean? I'm Ted Nelson.

And who IS Ted Nelson?
Or do you have a taste for the good life, Ted? It's in your blood.
I always knew there was more. I felt it.

Then remember, you are the heir to a billion dollar empire. You have a staff of literally thousands. Multiply everything you ever imagined by a million and you still can't even wrap your head around everything that is yours. ALL YOURS.
Teddy? I was thinking.
Hmmm?
Hmmm?
After graduation...maybe we could go away together?
After graduation...maybe we could go away together?
Whatever you want.
Teddy, I thought we were having a moment here.
Of course we were.
Ted! Do something!
What do you want me to do?

This is humiliating. We're being ejected from a prom!
This is humiliating. We're being ejected from a prom!
Hang in there, I'll think of something.
Well?
I guess...I don't know...I guess we should leave if we're not wanted.
Oh, sweetheart! We wish we could be right there to hug the living daylights out of you!
But if you're watching this, then it means we bit the dust.
But if you're watching this, then it means we bit the dust.

But don't worry...we'll be in heaven. The REAL heaven, I mean. Not that heaven is an actual place, but more like a state of being. Or not being. Who knows. Maybe we know now.
If you're anything like yours truly, then you probably figure we didn't want you when you were born, so who cares if we're dead? Am I right?
But we did want you. It's just that you don't always get to keep what you want. We knew you needed a real mom and dad.
We had no idea the nudie magazine we started in the garage would turn into all this.
Can you believe that was me?
Before we knew it, we created the most popular men's magazine in the entire nation. The rest is history.

Everything.
You're on the next plane home.
I'm Helen McDole. Your father's executive secretary.
No problem, consider it done. I had this idea of shooting on location. Outdoors, you know? Maybe at some famous Xenia landmarks. You think that would be a problem?
We'll send you the release forms, Ted. Our staffers will help in any way they can.
It's a little more serious than that, Bill. The stockholders have requested a meeting. They want our guarantee that this will never happen again. Some of them are even calling for Ted's resignation.
Look, the girls of Xenia are gorgeous, you'll see. Next month we'll be back to normal.
Your parents never wanted to interfere with your life, Ted. They knew your Mom and Dad loved you very much. They knew they did the right thing. But that doesn't mean they didn't watch you and miss you, from afar.
You mean they knew who I was?
You mean they knew who I was?
They kept this scrapbook of your life. It meant the world to them.
I wondered about them, for so many years. I wondered if I looked like them, acted like them. I wondered why they gave me up.
Giving you up was the most unselfish thing they ever did. When they founded "Heaven," they wished they could take you back but it was too late. All they could do was build the empire, knowing that someday it would all be yours.

Well, Jay. They've been exceptionally supportive.
Well, Jay. They've been exceptionally supportive.
Are they hitting you up for donations? Asking you to sponsor the local quilting bee?
I'm no stranger to the notion of philanthropy. Andrew Carnegie has long been one of my idols.
What about the future? You planning to rock the boat at all? Stir things up in "Heaven?"
Matter of fact, Jay, my uncle and I are planning to rethink the magazine. To expand the traditional western notions of "beauty."
I see, so you'd be open to little ladies from Pasadena, who want to show you their knickers?

Matter of fact, Jay, I'm planning a pictorial focusing on the women of my hometown, "The Girls of Xenia." Just to show my appreciation.
Mom, Dad. Meatloaf has come to represent all that Ted hates about his mediocre life and the world we live in. He's what you'd call clinically bummed.
Why can't we have pot roast or stroganoff or even a little London broil? I mean, for god's sake, we own a grocery store!
James, what are you doing here?
You can call me Jimmy again. Sheryl Petersen said James sounds too pretentious.

Look Ted. I'm cool with everything. You've long been dissatisfied with our mediocre little town. You've always had an itch for the good life. I'm happy for you. This couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
But just for the record, my Mom is a kick-ass schoolteacher and my Dad is the best damn auto mechanic this side of the Himalayas. You seem to have forgotten they opened Nelson's FAMILY Market so they could build something permanent, a legacy, for us. Their kids.
I didn't forget.

You ever look down on them again and call them "grocers" like it's a dirty word, and you'll be sucking your filet mignon through a straw for six to eight weeks. Got it?
Great.
From my wise, albeit youthful, vantage point, the world is your oyster. You scored big.
So, William Randolph. Your last big scoop contrasted the popularity of Rice Crispie Treats and chocolate Snickerdoodles at the annual bake sale.
That's just one example. My reporting has made a difference.

The school dumpsters used to overflow to the point where the stench was unbearable. My award winning exposé changed all that. The city added an extra weekday trash pick-up.
Is it true? Is ignorance bliss?
Look, I loved "Exposed!" and I hate it that you got busted. I know the school paper sucks in comparison, but it's really not THAT BAD.
Don't even tell me you're hot for Miss Titty Pom Poms over there.

A son who was raised in a world quite different from our own. Nevertheless, I was there for the lad. I guided him as best I could. But he's only seventeen, with

Hey, I've got it, I may as well spend it, right? I've always wanted to live where I could dive for my dinner.
And where might that be?
And where might that be?
I was thinking, Antigua, maybe.

I love Antigua. Maybe I'll come visit you.
I love Antigua. Maybe I'll come visit you.
I'd like that.
How soon can we get something?
We can get blood type right away. Dental records will take longer. You want DNA, that can take weeks.
Merritt, Forensics.
The teeth doin' any talkin'?

Ray. Stop calling. I told you the dental records will take time...

What about the blood?

Could be hers. Types match. Could be a lot of other people's too...

Second you get something on those teeth, I want it
Gator can't see what's in front of it for shit. They see out the sides. That one don't even know Walter's arm's in his mouth.
What if something distracts it and it snaps anyway?
What if something distracts it and it snaps anyway?
Then I guess Walter can kiss that arm of his goodbye. He don't use it for no good deeds anyway.
You come all the way out here to watch Walter?
I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions.
I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions.
About Suzie?
About Suzie?
Actually, I was wondering if I might ask you about Ray Duquette.
Actually, I was wondering if I might ask you about Ray Duquette.
He used to come around here. He had a thing going with one of the girls over at the Glades.
Got sort of hung up on her, from what hear.
She still work there?
She still work there?
No. Not after that night. I don't know what happened. Maybe he caught her with some john... All I know is, the next morning the girl was gone and there was a dead boy... Indian kid named Davy. Used to live down the road there in a wrecked car. Him and Suzie were at the Glades that night. It was right after that, Ray

Was there ever any kind of investigation...
Wasn't enough Van Ryan had to destroy the people who invested here. He got to be old, he and his rich cronies would come down here, hunt and whore, act like assholes. One trip he showed up with this young girl he'd picked up somewhere, gotten her pregnant then dumped her in the swamp. That came with her.
And the child...
And the child...
She had it, before she drank herself to death. Wasn't exactly a love child...
She had it, before she drank herself to death. Wasn't exactly a love child...
Suzie. Then you're not her grandmother...
Suzie. Then you're not her grandmother...
Raised her like she was, but no, Walter's my only child. He was a good boy, till the army took him.
So Suzie and Sandra Van Ryan were half- sisters.
And the other girl, Kelly. Suzie's niece.
You okay?
I'm fine. Nice TV.
How are you, Kelly? Would you like to take a break for a minute?
I just want to get it over with. My mom's making me do this. I just want to forget it.
I just want to get it over with. My mom's making me do this. I just want to forget it.
I know you do.
The next thing... his hand was in my shorts... you know, from behind. His fingers... his fingers...
Take your time.
Take your time.
They were in me. Both places... you know.
They were in me. Both places... you know.
I understand.
I understand.
He said something like, "Do you want it dirty7" or something. I tried to turn away, but he pushed me to the floor.

Was there penetration? Did he put himself inside you?
Was there penetration? Did he put himself inside you?
Yes. I said stop. I screamed. I mean that's how it sounded in my head. He hurt me...
Yes. I said stop. I screamed. I mean that's how it sounded in my head. He hurt me...
That's okay, Kelly. You're doing fine. But I have to ask you something here. When you say it hurt. Was this the first time a man was inside you?
That's okay, Kelly. You're doing fine. But I have to ask you something here. When you say it hurt. Was this the first time a man was inside you?
No. I've done it a couple of times, I mean with guys I dated. But this hurt... like, he was built... you know...
No. I've done it a couple of times, I mean with guys I dated. But this hurt... like, he was built... you know...
He was large?
Did you try to fight him?
I... he had my wrists pinned behind me. I remember my hands were cold.'
I... he had my wrists pinned behind me. I remember my hands were cold.'
Then what?
Then what?
He kept saying, "Let it happen, let it happen." Then he just stopped.
He kept saying, "Let it happen, let it happen." Then he just stopped.
You mean he withdrew...
You mean he withdrew...
Not at first. He was still inside but he wasn't moving or anything... He said we had this secret. And that now he'd be able to help me... because we were close... Something like that. I don't know. It's hard to remember, exactly.

Try, Kelly.
Try, Kelly.
I know one thing he said. It was when... when he took himself out and was standing up. He said, "Don't worry, I didn't come." I can't forget that. He said, "No little girl can ever make me come."
If old pictures interest you, come back some time, there's quite a collection down in the pagoda. I'll see you get a proper tour.
I'd like that.
And when you turned her toward the door, where did you expect her to go, without a car?
Again. I think we covered this. I told her I was going to call a cab.
Did you call anyone? Did you call her house to see if she got home? Did you call the Masons?
No.
No.
Weren't you a little worried about her...?
Weren't you a little worried about her...?
There's a strip mall not half a mile from my house. There's phones there. I cruised the place, but I didn't see her. I figured she was probably there but that she was angry and didn't want to be found. I don't know... Maybe I should have called. But it's not like Kelly can't take care of herself. I figured we'd just take it
Isn't that against the law, peeking into windows?
Suzie Toller is missing.
How long?
She didn't cone home last night. We found her car at the bus terminal, but nothing to suggest she bought a ticket.
She didn't cone home last night. We found her car at the bus terminal, but nothing to suggest she bought a ticket.
Maybe she used another name.
Maybe she used another name.
Ray thinks she was murdered.
I don't know what to say...
You could tell me where you were last night.
Kelly's file. Read it. You're going to find an angry, sexually confused girl who's made threats on her mother's life and a female lover she'd never identify.
Suzie?
I've got that two o'clock in town.
Back to the land of grownups.
That would make it about the time of her old man's suicide. You don't think that could explain some erratic behavior?
All I'm saying is, I think we should go slow here.
It's our job, Gloria.
Hunter's making it our job because Sandra Van Ryan's got a bug up his ass. You know that as well as I do. We're gonna trash this guy's life and I keep asking myself if it's really necessary.
Same as him. They saw her come. They saw her go. They saw him follow.
Still doesn't explain why he couldn't catch up with her. I mean how long does it take to put on a shirt?
We failed to mention the mower guy's a drunk, that he was after more beer and never really saw Kelly go into the house, so he can't say how long she was in there. Same with the kids. They saw her running down the street, but that's it. With no physical evidence, what do we have? Her word against his.
You're telling me you believe the guy?
You're telling me you believe the guy?
All I'm saying is, we let Sandra Van Ryan push us too hard, we're going to wind up looking stupid.
You can go up to one of those trees and peel the bark. You know what you get? More bark. And more bark. There's no core. Tree's not good tar anything but sucking up water. And now they can't get rid of them. They've tried poisons. Nothing works. They don't die.
Yeah, well, Van Ryan got his. I don't imagine he gives a shit now.
You remember that little girl walked out of our talk at Blue Bay?
The skinny brunette.
The skinny brunette.
This is where she lives. She wants to talk. Beats the shit out of me why she would call me at all. I busted her once for possession. she wound up doing about six months at Camp Nine.
This is where she lives. She wants to talk. Beats the shit out of me why she would call me at all. I busted her once for possession. she wound up doing about six months at Camp Nine.
You mean Camp Sixty-Nine.
That's what they called it when I was in Juvenile. It's a pretty dismal place.
It's a shithole. But she was dirty, what was I gonna do?
You saw the news today?
Lombardo's settlement?
Think back, before the suit was filed, before the trial. Lombardo had an affair with Sandra, right? So why not tell us about the affair? I mean it could be a hell of a motive for Kelly to fabricate her charge in the first place.
Maybe Lombardo's attorney was saving the affair for the trial.
Maybe Lombardo's attorney was saving the affair for the trial.
I thought of that. Then I said, come on, you're Lombardo. Your reputation is getting trashed. You want to stop the bleeding. You don't want to sit in jail for three months. Unless...
I thought of that. Then I said, come on, you're Lombardo. Your reputation is getting trashed. You want to stop the bleeding. You don't want to sit in jail for three months. Unless...
Unless what?
Unless what?
Unless you're setting up Sandra Van Ryan for the big payday.
They chumped us, Gloria, right from the start.
Why? You ask me, Lombardo had it pretty good already, nice job in a beautiful setting, popular, an active social life. He's gonna put this all on the line for some dicey play like what you're describing...
Why? You ask me, Lombardo had it pretty good already, nice job in a beautiful setting, popular, an active social life. He's gonna put this all on the line for some dicey play like what you're describing...
The job looks okay to us. But look at it from his point of view. The man's surrounded by wealth and privilege. But for him... it's just a reminder of what should have been his.
So what about the girls? Suzie's poor, but why would Kelly have to steal from her own mother? Surely her father...
Her father didn't leave her squat. The kid's got money in trust from her grandfather, but she can't touch that till her mother dies and Sandra seems to have the idea that Kelly ought to learn the value of a buck.
This one's got you working overtime, hasn't it?
I flat don't like the guy, Glory. He's dirty. And I'll tell you something else. You want to know how old man Lombardo lost his money? He was fucked out of it by old man Van Ryan, on a little item known as the Salt Creek Land Deal. It was after the war. Van Ryan set up a corporation to develop swamp land, got

Eliminate the competition.
Eliminate the competition.
You got it. The rich got richer. While the saps like Lombardo went belly-up in the swamp.
Where'd you come up with this stuff, anyway?
I net a guy in a bar.
Which she might have saved, if she hadn't set out to destroy the man's life.
What? You wouldn't go after some guy you thought raped your daughter? Cone on. She bought the same story we did...
Guess I kind of lost it there.
You could say that.
You could say that.
Were you ever in a situation where you could see a thing coming and you didn't do what you could to stop it?
We all have...
I mean something bad, Gloria, something bad you saw coning, and you didn't do anything, and then it happened. I did that once. I don't want to do it again.
It's starting, Gloria. This is how it begins...
Ray. We don't know anything yet. She could be anywhere...
I'm gonna take you back to the office. Will you put out a call on Suzie's car for me?
You have someplace to be?
If you want company...
Just check out the car.
Two kids could've gotten into a fight, lost a couple of teeth.
Those are Suzie Toller's teeth.
Those are Suzie Toller's teeth.
Where's the body?
Where's the body?
The swamp, most likely... Lombardo's a swamp rat, knows the body will never be found there. But he's made a mistake.
Her grandmother said she'd been threatening to run away. And I found the car at the Miami bus terminal.
You don't think Sam could've put it there?
Poor dumb Suzie, she never had a chance.
We don't know that, Ray...
Will you do me one favor?
Ray, you heard him...
Ray, you heard him...
What if I'm right, Gloria? What if I'm right and Hunter's wrong? What do you do if you see a bad thing coming?
Stick with me on this Gloria. I need you...
And if the teeth aren't Suzie's? You'll give this up?
And if the teeth aren't Suzie's? You'll give this up?
If I'm wrong about those teeth -- it's a promise.
I'm tired, Ray. I'm going home.
Where's Lombardo?
Where's Lombardo?
He's leaving the country. And I don't give a shit.
He's leaving the country. And I don't give a shit.
The blood type on the rocks matches Suzie's.
The blood type on the rocks matches Suzie's.
It's Homicide's job now, Ray, let 'em do it. I'll tell you something else, there's more to this story than you know, Ray... If Suzie is dead, I think Hunter may be on the right track...
That bothers you?
Yeah, maybe, a little.
Yeah, maybe, a little.
Why is that?
You didn't tell me you were gonna put me on the fucking news.
We need to tape the interview, Suzie. No one will see it but us. Now when was this, that Mr. Lombardo gave you the ride?
About a year ago.
He dropped Jimmy off first?
He dropped Jimmy off first?
Yeah.
Yeah.
And when he arrived at your house, was anyone there?
And when he arrived at your house, was anyone there?
No.
No.
So you were alone.
So you were alone.
Yes.
Yes.
Did he come in with you?
Did he come in with you?
I guess.
At that point were you able to fight him off?
No. He stopped by himself. Okay? That's all. Let me go.
He did say something.
What was that?
What was that?
He said, "No little bitch can ever make me come."
Why?
I think she's acting. I think she set it up to be alone with him because she wanted him to come on to her. I think maybe she's upset that he didn't...
That doesn't make him a child rapist. There's something else. This girl's had some problems. Wrecked a couple of her mom's cars. Ran away...
Where's this coming from?
Where's this coming from?
I worked Juvenile in Dade County for three years. We had a missing persons on Kelly Van Ryan for two weeks... Maybe a year ago... The family kept it out of the papers.
I want a full-scale investigation.
You know what that will mean for Lombardo.
You know what that will mean for Lombardo.
I don't care. You heard that girl's statement. I think he's dirty. Get me a case.
Or maybe she thought that was what she wanted and she got a little more than she bargained for...
The line I get on this guy, is that he's done half the women in Blue Bay.
Not that stuff about her running away, him trying to find her. That's bullshit.
What about witnesses?
What about witnesses?
We've got three. Guy mowing his yard, couple of kids playing hoops.
We've got three. Guy mowing his yard, couple of kids playing hoops.
And what do they say?
Are you crazy, Ray?
You heard Kelly say "Sam." That was Lombardo on the phone. And you saw the girls...
You heard Kelly say "Sam." That was Lombardo on the phone. And you saw the girls...
Ray. The conversation on this tape is totally unintelligible. What we have here, is you on the Van Ryan property, without a proper warrant, shooting a porn flick...
Ray. The conversation on this tape is totally unintelligible. What we have here, is you on the Van Ryan property, without a proper warrant, shooting a porn flick...
I don't believe I'm hearing this. A month ago you were pulling these two apart at the courthouse. They were acting. They were all acting, from the beginning. And we bought it, hook, line and sinker... And now they're home free with six million of Sandra Van Ryan's money.
Oh, Ray... no...
You think this is just about money, about us looking foolish? Question him. You're gonna find a stone cold manipulative psychopath. And those girls are going to wind up dead...
Kelly's next, Gloria.
Get off this Ray, now. If there is any evidence here, it's for Homicide. You get an ID, you call me.
I fucked up. I lost control of the situation, the one thing they train you for... God, what did I do?
Just tell us what happened.
Just tell us what happened.
I told Kelly Van Ryan she was under arrest for conspiracy and murder. I did her rights.
She bit you?
Bit, scratched. But I had her pinned. She calmed down. I was going to cuff her... She said she thought she was going to be sick. She asked to use the bathroom.
I told her I was coming with her. She nodded, like she understood. We stood up together.
You didn't cuff her?
You didn't cuff her?
She looked shaky, but lucid. I thought, I would just go with her, stand at the door... I think I looked away. A split second. Then, bingo. Just like that. She puts a knee into my groin. There was this coffee table between us and the wall. She got one foot on that thing and launched herself at the gun case. Thing had a
The teeth, were they...
Suzie Toller's. And that's the only thing saving your sorry ass.
You guess? Did he or didn't he?
Yeah... okay... he did
Yeah... okay... he did
And then what... he touched you? Did you maybe flirt a little...
And then what... he touched you? Did you maybe flirt a little...
I wanna go home now.
What did you do then?
Shit, what difference does it make... Nobody's gonna believe me anyway...
Shit, what difference does it make... Nobody's gonna believe me anyway...
Suzie! Did this man rape you?
Suzie! Did this man rape you?
Okay! He did. He pushed me to the floor and he did it to me. Now, can I go home?
He pushed into me... I couldn't stop him... it hurt.
I'm sorry... you said it hurt? Why?
I'm sorry... you said it hurt? Why?
Because... it was the biggest I've ever seen. And I've seen a lot on their way through Jack's Fish Camp.
Ms. Toller?
I said he did.
I said he did.
Ms. Toller. I'm asking you now, under oath, did Samuel Lonbardo rape you?
This wasn't my idea.
I'm sorry?
He was my friend at first. Then I got busted... he didn't even stick up for me. I had to go away to that hellhole. It's like, you're his favorite, then who cares? You wanna know something? When Kelly said we should do this, I thought cool, all these big shots screwing me over, like that cop, Duquette. Now they're gonna get screwed.
Your Honor... Please...
Come on. Beats study hall, doesn't it?
No!
Thank you, Jimmy.
Hey, man, at least in study hail I could meditate.
You know, I want to thank you for getting me into this class... No way was my old man going to spring for the fees...
Hey, you're working for it. Least you're supposed to be.
What about you, Jimbo, you need a ride?
What?
What?
A ride. You want one?
A ride. You want one?
Yeah. But I got my bike.
It's those rocks, up there.
You and Suzie used to come out here together?
You and Suzie used to come out here together?
Yeah, sometimes. Lots of the kids hang out here. You really think something bad happened to Suzie?
Yeah, sometimes. Lots of the kids hang out here. You really think something bad happened to Suzie?
Lombardo ever come out here?
I say something funny?
No. But I mean... just the idea that Mr. Lombardo would...
No. But I mean... just the idea that Mr. Lombardo would...
Way I hear it, he was pretty tight with the kids, one of the guys...
Way I hear it, he was pretty tight with the kids, one of the guys...
Yeah, but...
Will you calm down. Duquette's gonna come to you just like he did to me. You're gonna have to be ready for him.
Yeah, but he can't push you around like he can me. You've got family and they've got clout. With we it's different... with me...
Yeah, but he can't push you around like he can me. You've got family and they've got clout. With we it's different... with me...
Yeah, I've got family and they've got clout and now you have me. Right? And Sam. Believe me, Suzie, this dickhead's not going to send you anywhere. He's gonna try and rattle your cage, and that's it. Stay strong and he can't do shit.
Yeah, I've got family and they've got clout and now you have me. Right? And Sam. Believe me, Suzie, this dickhead's not going to send you anywhere. He's gonna try and rattle your cage, and that's it. Stay strong and he can't do shit.
Man, I wanna smoke a joint.
I can't believe you called Sam. What's the matter with you?
I'm scared, that's what. I'm scared there's no one to trust.
I'm scared, that's what. I'm scared there's no one to trust.
You can trust me.
You're gonna fuck me over, aren't you?
Oh, for Christ's sake.
Oh, for Christ's sake.
You are.
You are.
Are you retarded, or just brain dead from whiffin' fumes out there in the swamp...
Anybody ever tell you that stuff will rot your brain?
What brain?
What are you looking at?
Nothing.
I thought we were goin' to a movie.
I think we just need to get wasted.
I wanna live at the beach someday.
Shit.
Is there some reason why you're here?
Curiosity, I guess.
Curiosity, I guess.
About what? How to improve your breast stroke?
Excuse me?
You all gonna go down to the Caribbean together?
The thing about it is, threesomes so rarely work out.
You're out of your mind.
You're out of your mind.
I've been a cop for a while, Kelly. It's hard enough for one person to keep a secret, let alone three. And then there's the love angle. I mean do you and Sam really want that little pill-head around, now that you have the money?
Am I right, did Sam sell you on the idea right up front, of whacking Suzie? That's murder, Kelly.
Police -- God -- get a life.
Get off my property.
I'm not on your property!
Is that Sam Lombardo?
Hi, Mon.
Hi, Mon.
Sam! Hi!
Which one of your "bodyguards" is that?
Whichever one I want.
Okay, what's the matter?
You notice my new jumper?
My friends buy me clothes, so I don't look like trash.
I would hardly say you look like trash.
I would hardly say you look like trash.
No thanks to you.
Kelly. What is it?
I miss Dad.
I miss Dad.
Jesus. Well, I do too, sometimes...
Jesus. Well, I do too, sometimes...
No you don't.
No you don't.
He didn't have to kill himself, Kelly. He could have gone out and gotten a job. Christ, he could've found another rich woman... He never had a problem tucking my friends when we were married.
What?
I was raped. By Sam Lombardo.
He... Sam Lombardo?
Yes. God, Mom...
You didn't have to fly back -- from -- wherever, for me...
I'm here to congratulate my friends and their children. I'm leaving again tonight.
I'm here to congratulate my friends and their children. I'm leaving again tonight.
Don't bother. I'm taking a trip.
Don't bother. I'm taking a trip.
Where, the mall?
Where, the mall?
A friend of mine bought a boat.
Okay, try me on Sunday. I'm going out to the Everglades on Saturday. You guys can wash the mud off.
Deal. You know, I just looked out front. My ride wasn't there. You suppose you could give me one?
Don't forget the car wash.
I won't.
Look, he forgot. I knew it.
No I didn't. Check out the Jeep. It's nice and dirty for you. But you might want to wait a minute. The Mercedes is leaving.
Where's the hose? We can set up.
In back of the garage.
So, where you off to now?
Aren't you forgetting something? Your coupon. We gotta have it.
Aren't you forgetting something? Your coupon. We gotta have it.
Jeez, that thing... Can't you...
Jeez, that thing... Can't you...
Rules are rules, Mr. Lombardo.
All right. I'll have to look for it.
Mr. Lombardo. We're running kind of late. How about if Nicole goes on to the Mansons? You could give me a ride when you find the ticket.
Kelly...
Drop dead... You know where my mom is trying to get the money to pay you off? She's trying to break my trust. How do you like that? I can't touch it until she's dead and she won't give me a dime and now she's trying to break it to pay you...
Drop dead... You know where my mom is trying to get the money to pay you off? She's trying to break my trust. How do you like that? I can't touch it until she's dead and she won't give me a dime and now she's trying to break it to pay you...
Look, Kelly... I'm sorry... I know what you've been through... I should've seen something like this coning.
Jesus Christ, what are you doing?
So you got my mom's money.
How much?
About six and a half million dollars.
God, you scared the shit out of me. You must be crazy coming here.
Of course I'm crazy. Ask my mom.
From now on, if we're seen together, it's got to be accidental. I thought that was understood...
Hey, come on... We've got to have at least one victory party.
The only way we're gonna blow this now, is if we do it ourselves...
Do it to ourselves?
Do it to ourselves?
We have to stick with the plan.
We have to stick with the plan.
Stick?
Kelly. Is Suzie there?
Yes.
Yes.
Shit. I was afraid of that. She left this garbled message on my machine. Can you calm her down?
Shit. I was afraid of that. She left this garbled message on my machine. Can you calm her down?
Why can't you come...
Why can't you come...
No! Christ. Listen, Kelly, I'm counting on you. You calm her down. I mean do whatever you have to, whatever it takes...
No! Christ. Listen, Kelly, I'm counting on you. You calm her down. I mean do whatever you have to, whatever it takes...
You know what it takes.
You know what it takes.
Then do it. I need you on this Kelly. Do it tonight. We'll figure something out... Okay?
I'm here.
Okay. I want you to hear this too. We've got to be cool. All of us. People think I'm rich, for Christ's sake. I'm doing what rich guys do. I'm spending my money. It's more suspicious if I sit around doing nothing. Now don't let this cop fuck with your minds.
I'm sorry, Kelly. I'm sorry it had to happen like this. She was losing it...
There was no way. That cop would've gotten her to tell him... everything. She was weak and dumb...
Hello?
Hello.
Hello.
God, I've been calling you.
I'm really serious. That cop, he keeps watching me.
Duquette. Forget him...
Duquette. Forget him...
I can't help it. He gives me the creeps... I mean why was Suzie so scared of him? She's not that way. I think he did something...
I can't help it. He gives me the creeps... I mean why was Suzie so scared of him? She's not that way. I think he did something...
Yeah, he got her busted for possession...
Yeah, he got her busted for possession...
I don't know... I think it was something else... Suzie says the bust was bullshit...
I don't know... I think it was something else... Suzie says the bust was bullshit...
And you believe her?
And you believe her?
I don't know. I want to see you...
I don't know. I want to see you...
Kelly... Relax. Take one of your mom's valium or something. In another week you get on the plane. It's over. We're rich.
Kelly... Relax. Take one of your mom's valium or something. In another week you get on the plane. It's over. We're rich.
But what if they find out... God, they'd put you in the gas chamber...
So if they're tapping your phone, we're dead. Stay in the guest house. Skip the graduation parties. You'll never see Duquette. Okay? I love you.
Okay. I love you too.
That never seemed to worry you at the Glades.
That's not your line.
That's not your line.
Say you love me.
Say you love me.
I love you. Now give me the line.
I love you. Now give me the line.
No little girl can ever make me come.
I'm running away.
You think that's wise?
You think that's wise?
Um-huh. And guess what else? I have toys.
But check this...
Ken. I'm in some trouble. I need an attorney and you're the only one I know. So I figured I'd start here.
Good thinking.
You can tie whoever did it to Sandra Van Ryan...
You can tie whoever did it to Sandra Van Ryan...
Forget it.
Forget it.
Lady has some deep pockets. That's all I'm saying.
Lady has some deep pockets. That's all I'm saying.
I know how deep her pockets are, Ken. I thought I might be able to save my fucking house with an equity loan. Guess who's on the board of directors at the bank?
Can't you take that stupid thing off?
Not in here. Chiropractor comes in here for lunch sometimes.
You're not in bad shape, really. I know you think you are, but you're not. Let me tell you why. Sandra Van Ryan.
What's that supposed to mean?
What's that supposed to mean?
For you to be getting this kind of heat, for what they have on you... It doesn't add up. Sandra Van Ryan's got 'em running scared. And I'll tell you something else, you rush, you get careless.
Nellie Gail Ranch...
Sound nice? It's a fucking drug rehab farm. It's where Kelly Van Ryan went when her morn fished her out of the swamp. Meanwhile, you get educator of the year I mean there's no way they can put this thing in front of a jury. Shit, they haven't even taken your statement yet. Reason? They're still shoveling dirt and my guess is, they're coming

There's nothing for them to get.
There's nothing for them to get.
Good. So what we're going to do is march right to Hunter's doorstep. We're going to insist they take a statement. We're going to tell them to charge your ass or get off your back. They're walking a fine line here. Defamation of character, malicious prosecution...

I just want my life back...
I just want my life back...
Fair enough. Let's go make a statement.
Come on, let loose!
I was just thinking about where I'm gonna stay. I lost the house. It's like waking up from a goddamn nightmare.

You'll get over it. We've got a knockdown, airtight, motherfucker of a lawsuit against Sandra Van Ryan.
You'll get over it. We've got a knockdown, airtight, motherfucker of a lawsuit against Sandra Van Ryan.
Just like that?
Just like that?
Just like that? These people ruined your life, bro.
You're saying that Kelly was raped by Sam Lombardo.
That's right.
Who is it?
Detective Duquette, Ms. Van Ryan. Let me in. Now.
Where is she?
Where she lives. In the guest house. Now will you tell me what this is about?
Where she lives. In the guest house. Now will you tell me what this is about?
I'm placing your daughter under arrest.
I'm placing your daughter under arrest.
You can't...
You can't...
Suzie Toller is dead. You don't want Kelly to be next, then take my advice. Stay out of my way.
Meet my partner, Gloria Perez.
I did. At Blue Balls.
It's Celine. He's okay. He had a pretty good line on what cheap fucks people are.
So Suzie, you called us, remember?
No.
Will they?
Will they?
It doesn't look like it.
It doesn't look like it.
Then he'll be back at Blue Balls?
You ought to watch it with that shit, Suzie. You get busted again, you go back in a two-tine loser.
You got something against cigarettes?
Yeah, they're bad for your health. I'm tryin' to look out for you...
That's cop bullshit.
That's cop bullshit.
Well, you're half right. Best thing you could do for yourself right now would be to talk to me.
Well, you're half right. Best thing you could do for yourself right now would be to talk to me.
About what?

Every triangle I've ever seen never lasts. Somebody's got to go.

Is this supposed to mean something to me? What triangle?

You, Kelly, Sam.
You, Kelly, Sam.
I don't have to listen to this. And you can't shove me around. I have friends now...
Is that what you think? You have friends? Is that what they told you?
I don't mean who you're thinking. I have other friends...
I don't mean who you're thinking. I have other friends...
Suzie, Suzie... This is me, Ray, you're talking to. We both know you don't have shit, never have had shit, never will have shit...
Get away from me.
Don't you see what this means? You really think Sam and Kelly are gonna give you a third of the money? You, the pill-head with the rap sheet?
Don't you see what this means? You really think Sam and Kelly are gonna give you a third of the money? You, the pill-head with the rap sheet?
Shut up.
Davy.
That's right. That was his name.
You... I should've killed you myself. should never have left it up to him...
Shoulda, coulda, woulda... Get him in the water.
Sam, for godsake.
Hey, Ray. Guess whose name is on the numbered bank account besides yours and Sam's?
Why don't you tell us one more time, how Kelly came to be with you, alone in your house.
Story's the same, Detective...
I had to go look for this coupon.
The one you bought at school.
The one you bought at school.
Like I said, I hadn't really expected to use it. Anyway, I'm going through a drawer. I hear a car. I look out the window. I see Nicole driving away. I leave my room, and there's Kelly.

Yes.
Yes.
But you can't tell us what she wanted to talk about.

I could, but it's confidential. Look, the point is, we didn't talk. I told her this was not an appropriate time or place.

And she began to cry. And you put an arm around her.
And she began to cry. And you put an arm around her.
Yes. Mainly to turn her toward the door. I told her we would talk on Monday, in the office.
But she ran away.
That's right.
But you do admit to touching her, to putting your arm around her. Isn't that against the rules?
It is and I don't. Ordinarily... But, I mean... there's this kid standing in front of you crying...
It is and I don't. Ordinarily... But, I mean... there's this kid standing in front of you crying...
With a thirty-five inch bustline in a wet T-shirt with no bra...
Fuck you. This is bullshit. I'm outta here.
Sit down, Lombardo.
Yeah, well, you fixed that. What the hell happened, anyway?
The bitch shot me, is what happened.
Hey, what did you want me to do, die?
Well, shit, you're the cop, they don't teach you to disarm people, shoot them in the leg or something? You weren't supposed to kill her for Christ's sake.
Did you become squeamish about these things before or after you bludgeoned little Suzie Toller to death with a wine bottle? Jesus, man. It couldn't have worked out better. They're convinced Kelly whacked Suzie. I can't talk 'em out of it. We should be celebrating. This thing worked out just like you said, only better.
Kelly was supposed to be framed, not killed. What I'm telling you is, I don't like surprises.
You mean this thing?
Yes, we call it a winch. And these are shrouds, and these are stays.

I thought this was supposed to be a vacation. Why didn't you buy a nice big power boat?

Come on, man. I'll make a sailor out of you yet.
Come on, man. I'll make a sailor out of you yet.
Yeah, or get me drowned.
Jesus, man... You okay?
That how you planned it? You take cut Suzie, get me to hang it on Kelly, then dump me in the ocean...
That how you planned it? You take cut Suzie, get me to hang it on Kelly, then dump me in the ocean...
Come off it, man... It was an accident.
How much is about six and a half million divided by three?
Jesus. Two million one hundred thirty-three thousand three hundred thirty-three and change.
Sam...
Put Kelly on too.
But I..
Shut up. Don't fall apart. The only people who can blow this is us. Remember?
Yeah, right.
Good. Just keep telling yourselves that, the only people who can fuck this up is us.
I was worried about you, Suzie. I decided we should all get together, one more time, before we split up.
Are you mad at me?
Are you mad at me?
No, no. Look, I probably should have told you a little more, about the part I intended to play. We'll go through it all again tonight.
That was about as grim as it gets.
The guy was history when he killed Kelly. You knew that.
The guy was history when he killed Kelly. You knew that.
But then you knew what he was like all along... Maybe his killing Kelly was a thing you had counted on...
But then you knew what he was like all along... Maybe his killing Kelly was a thing you had counted on...
But then it is better this way, don't you think? No loose ends.
What?
That was the same thing Ray said.
What's wrong?
Fuck the winch. I wanna drive.
Seems to like some of the same places you do. Funny you never met.
Yeah, real funny. You're wrong about this, I could get busted on the spot.
Yeah, real funny. You're wrong about this, I could get busted on the spot.
Trust me, the guy's dirty. He'll like it. Especially the part about offing me. Now get out of here. Go make yourself a new friend.
I've seen you out there in your old air boat, thinking about what might have been, old man Van Ryan hadn't fucked you out of it. What if I told you I had a way we could get a big piece of it back?
We?
We?
Well, I'd need the famous Lombardo charm, not that you'd have to do anything you haven't done already.
How...
Walter. He's been aimin' that Brownie through knotholes for years. I saw these, I knew he'd finally struck gold. I can't decide which came out better, that little straw Kelly's got up her nose, or that vibrator you've got up her ass. What do you think, Mr. Lombardo?

I think there's some things you do, you don't want to see yourself doing them.
What? You're going to drive off without even saying hi?
Hi, Sandy.
Hi, Sandy.
Why don't you come in, have a drink?
Why don't you come in, have a drink?
Can't. Got a passenger.
I can't, Sandy. I've got to run.
I'll bet. Look, Sam. Why don't you come by this weekend. We'll take the boat out...
I'll bet. Look, Sam. Why don't you come by this weekend. We'll take the boat out...
Sorry, Sandy. I've got plans.

What? Running over alligators with that silly swamp jalopy when you could be sailing a real boat...
What? Running over alligators with that silly swamp jalopy when you could be sailing a real boat...
Swamp's where it's at, Sandy. Gives you a look into the muck we all crawled out of. You ought to try it some time.
Sandy... What's up?
Listen, Kelly skipped school. Have you talked to her?
Listen, Kelly skipped school. Have you talked to her?
No.
No.
Shit. Here we go again.
Shit. Here we go again.
Didn't you see her this morning?
Didn't you see her this morning?
To tell you the truth, I haven't seen her since Friday.
Look. I know you're seeing Barbara Baxter. So what?
So maybe I'm a one-woman man.
Grab a clue, Sam. You're a hired hand around here. Enjoy it while it lasts.
Goodbye, Sandra.

Your train? Listen, friend, you're obviously lost. ... I've got orders here to take possession of this train and to investigate a certain crime.
Interesting. Mine say the same thing, and they don't mention you, not even as a valet, although we could talk...
Just another bureaucratic foul-up. You know how these pencil-pushers are. So, why don't you just run on back and explain what happened?
Funny, I was just thinking you should do the same. Since I am already in residence, and am obviously the man for the job, it's been grand making your acquaintance, sir. And best of luck in all your future endeavors.
You're quite the wordsmith, fiddle boy. But nobody smooth-talks his way into my assignment.
If you're implying our little imbroglio has reached an impasse whose only resolution can be found in a more primitive fashion, then I for one am fully prepared to do so... al fresco.
But don't pull that again.
Wouldn't dream of it.

Attractive buttons, yes? But yank one off, toss it, and poof! It emits a cloud of sleeping gas.

All right, if it'll make you happy, I'll try that.
Try what?
Your little jack-in-the-box gun. That might be useful.
Well... it's the only one I have. It's gotten me out of quite a few tight spots...
That should put us ahead of the criminals.
I'll work on it.
Aha!
Aha?
Aha?
Yes, aha. A brass screw.
Yes, aha. A brass screw.

Doyle, once around the park. I need a moment to prepare.
Prepare what?

My disguise. And here...
Come Llewellyn, don't tarry.
Call me that again, and you're going to find a boot where it doesn't belong.
Call me that again, and you're going to find a boot where it doesn't belong.
Jim, people talk to foreigners, speak more openly, especially to those as famous as I, Chauncey McNeil Armstrong, English lyric poet.
That's a lot of butler.
Quite. Come, let's mingle.
Quite. Come, let's mingle.
Do your own mingling. I'm not hanging around with some dandy named Chauncey.
Doctor V. L. Pemberton. I knew it. He's a scientist all right. Inventor of the Pemberton Condensed Steam Engine. I'm telling you, Artemus, Loveless is our man.
Whoa, Jim. Maybe. But we can't arrest this little pillar of society on maybe.
Whoa, Jim. Maybe. But we can't arrest this little pillar of society on maybe.
All right. How about this? We put a watch on this Pemberton, somebody tries to grab him...
All right. How about this? We put a watch on this Pemberton, somebody tries to grab him...
Then we've got our proof. Excellent. And where do we find this fortunate scientist?
You know your Morse Code almost as well as I.
Almost?
Almost?
Yes. Now, observe....
You feeling all right?
Come on, Jim. I'm serious. Dot... Dash. It'll be our secret means of communication should we ever need it.
Now, what was that?
You're either having a seizure or you just said "hello."
You're either having a seizure or you just said "hello."
Good, I wasn't sure you were up to it.
What was all that back there?
All what?
All what?
All that jumping and kicking.
All that jumping and kicking.
That? Oh, it's a kind of Chinese fighting... I was sort of caught once with a lovely Chinese girl out in San Francisco. Her big brothers were kind enough to teach it to me I've got a book on it, if you're interested.
Garrison...? Then the President was right. Except it's not a foreign power, it's a bunch of die- hard Rebels trying to make the South rise again.
And if they've got Dr. Loveless building weapons like those flying bombs... they just might do it.
Could I just point out, this is a perfect example of the criminal mind exploiting modern invention.
I'm going to hit you.
Never seen a gun fire so fast!
It's a repeating steam cannon!
At least I tried something.
Hey, I tried the board.
Damn it, this is ridiculous.
At least the thing's not that fast. We just follow it. Whenever it stops, we're there, waiting.
At least the thing's not that fast. We just follow it. Whenever it stops, we're there, waiting.
That's right... That's good.
Jim, are you all right?
No, I'm not all right. They got away. And we can't even follow them. They can get off the tracks anywhere they want.
No, I'm not all right. They got away. And we can't even follow them. They can get off the tracks anywhere they want.
Which is why we're heading to Houston, Texas. Home of the Loveless Steam Engine Works.
If you don't mind my asking, were you always the way you are?
What way is that?
What way is that?
So... spontaneous. All that leaping off buildings and Chinese fighting and whatnot.
So... spontaneous. All that leaping off buildings and Chinese fighting and whatnot.
"Spontaneous." I like that. Most people say something like "hare- brained reckless son-of-a-bitch."

Well... that, too.
Well... that, too.
Nothing much to it really. When I was younger I got into a pretty bad run-in with the Wyler Boys. I saw them coming. But I didn't act fast enough. Second-guessed myself. And it cost me... cost me dearly.
So... what happened?
Those kids, they took my wagon. Never got it back.
Those kids, they took my wagon. Never got it back.
Uh... how long ago was this?
Uh... how long ago was this?
I was six. And ever since, my policy is: Act first and worry later.
You might have mentioned you had that.
I thought all you needed were your fists and your gun.
Strange... you'd think he'd have this place better guarded.
I find most criminals slip up somewhere...
They're so precious when they're asleep.
You really enjoy yourself, don't you?
Can you fill me in here?
Sure. We have no idea what's going on.
Sure. We have no idea what's going on.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Come on, let's at least see if we can find Dr. Pemberton.
Come on, let's at least see if we can find Dr. Pemberton.
You go ahead. I'll stick with Loveless.
Know what this is?
Sure. It's a wind-up... thing.
Sure. It's a wind-up... thing.
A cylinder recorder. My own design.
This is good.
Shhh! Come on. Tell us something!
Oh, damn! That's it.
It's better than nothing.
It's better than nothing.
It is?
It is?
He's going to put on a pith helmet and kill some guy named Willard.
No record of him.
You'd think if Loveless is going to kill him he could at least be a prominent citizen.
What's this?
Sounds like a train. Looks like a train.
Sounds like a train. Looks like a train.
Yes. And a much nicer one than ours.
Willard...
It's not a guy...
It's not a guy...
It's a town!
Got to be somewhere that's hot. He said it was "damnably hot."
That rules out Willard, Vermont; Willard, Minnesota... Willard, New Mexico?
Damn, I wish this thing would go faster.
Relax. We're almost there.
Relax. We're almost there.
We oughta get a couple of those rockets. Voom! We're there before we left!
What is that?
This? I'm testing a new spirit gum, to see how it holds.
This? I'm testing a new spirit gum, to see how it holds.
And people are actually fooled by that?
And people are actually fooled by that?
My disguises have helped me solve many a difficult case. I spent three years on the stage, you know. Remind me sometime to regale you with my Lear.
Not again.
I adjusted it.
So the idea is if a guy punches me, he really hurts his hand?
You said it popped out too easily. Nothing's ever good enough for you, is it?
When we find him, he is mine.
Oh, no, we split him fifty-fifty.
What if these tracks are just leading us to an Indian village or some old coot's mining claim?
Not likely. There must be tracks of twenty different wagons. Freight wagons, carriages, buckboards...
Excellent detective work, sir. You should have the honor of going first.
Oh, thank you.
Oh, thank you.
My pleasure.
Artemus, you ready for this? His next target is Albuquerque.
What? President Grant is...!
What? President Grant is...!
I know! I know!
I know! I know!
I don't have to tell you what that would do to our careers!
I don't have to tell you what that would do to our careers!
We've got to stop him right here, now! With that armored steam engine of his it'll be a slaughter.

I'd love to stop him, but have you noticed the hundred armed men?
I'd love to stop him, but have you noticed the hundred armed men?
There's only seventy-eight.
There's only seventy-eight.
Oh, well, then let's kick some ass!
It was in your book.
Well, hell, maybe we do have a chance.
Are those just button buttons or...?
Of course not.
My hat is off to you, sir.
Thank you.
God in heaven, what is that?!
That's... that's the criminal mind about to stomp our sorry butts!
My God! He's so excessive!
Where have you been?
Pull the balloon right in front of him! We'll board the damn thing!
Oh, I see, an easy plan!
The machine was stopped! It seemed like a perfect time to disable it! Why'd you have to throw it into full throttle?!
He was going to shoot me! Do you mind?!
He was going to shoot me! Do you mind?!
All right, all right... It'll be okay. I mean, eventually it'll just run out of steam.
All right, all right... It'll be okay. I mean, eventually it'll just run out of steam.
In the next two minutes?
Artemus! Look at that. Brand spanking new. She's a beauty, huh? Let's get rolling.
What is this? A whole new train?
What is this? A whole new train?
Well, sure. Didn't you get your orders?
Well, we'll stay in touch... you know.
I'm sure we will.
Terribly sorry. I'm always sticking this where it doesn't belong. Federal agents, ma'am. We're rescuing a kidnap victim...
Yes, me!
Yes, me!
You? Dr. Pemberton? Of course. How novel.
You didn't tell us you had this on!
My Lord, he was telling the truth!
He calls it the Tarantula.
But it only has six legs.
He's not giving up?
Well, see, he had this little wagon when he was a kid...
Time for you to get off, Ma'am.
Like hell! I'll see it through! Ram the bastard!
A new friend?
We'll see.
Anyone?
Here. Mr. Tyler. He claims a certain skill at handling firearms.
Here. Mr. Tyler. He claims a certain skill at handling firearms.
Wonderful! Our new friend from the wild west. Please...
I could get used to this, looking down on people.
They don't even realize they should be frightened.
They don't even realize they should be frightened.
Well, let's help them with that. Take the legs.
My name's Tyler. Frank Tyler. Pleased to meet you, ma'am.
I get that feeling. You know, Mr. Tyler, I'm the kind of woman who doesn't believe men are much more than a complete waste of time. But after spying you across the room, I'm tempted to suspend my disbelief, at least for the evening.

I don't recollect ever being compared to a pistol before.
Please do. I'm a man who appreciates a good firearm.
Really?
Really?
Well, where I come from it kind of goes with the territory. Texas.

Well, sir, you are proving to be one of my more interesting guests.
Your guests, ma'am?
Your guests, ma'am?
Yes, in a way. I'm the Doctor's social secretary. I handle his correspondence, send out the invitations, you know.
Oh, don't worry. I've already overlooked the fact your name's not actually on our guest list.
Well, I owe you one, don't I?
Well, I owe you one, don't I?
You most certainly do.
You must excuse the Doctor. No one has ever beaten him at his little game.
I don't like to lose, either.
Have you taken a wrong turn, Mr. Tyler?
You tell me.
You tell me.
I'm not so sure Dr. Loveless would like to find his social secretary dancing in the dark with an uninvited stranger.

Forgive me, but you don't strike me as the social secretary type.
Forgive me, but you don't strike me as the social secretary type.
Thank you. But the truth is, I'm a single woman in a man's world. That leaves me very few choices, doesn't it?
Thank you. But the truth is, I'm a single woman in a man's world. That leaves me very few choices, doesn't it?
I suppose so. But life can be hard for a man, too.
Just a little insurance... against the unexpected.
Would that include me?
Would that include me?
Oh, I would hope not.
You've... done... this... before.
I've had some practice.
She's perfectly safe.
Really? Like General Garrison or didn't you hear all that shooting?
My. It's gotten longer.
You bring the best out in a man.
You bring the best out in a man.
I try. Please, if you promise to protect me, I'll testify against him. I'll give you an ironclad case.
You know, I really hate being toyed with before someone shoots me.
Fine, I'll stop.
Look, I'm Captain James West...
Well, Captain, then the answer is your train is still here.
Your private train, sir.
Private train?
Private train?
That would be correct. Orders from the President himself. Trans- portation at your beck and call. No delays. Although, the government's generosity takes me a tad by surprise, as well.
Doyle's the name, sir. Of the Connemara Doyles. And there's not a man riding the rails who holds a candle to meself. That having been said, sir, you're five minutes late so let's be on our way! Your friend's already aboard.
My friend?
Would you be thinking... ramming speed, sir?
I would, Mr. Doyle! Are you game?
Don't try to bamboozle me, Colonel. Has another scientist been kidnapped or not?
Well, yes sir. A Professor Morton, but with just a little more time, sir, I can assure you a breakthrough on this case...
Listen, in two days I'm embarking on a tour of the western territories. And I want to know at least one problem is being handled competently in my absence.
Of course, sir, that's why I've assigned a new man. And he's no ordinary Marshal. He's quite sophisticated. Three college degrees. A master of disguise. Speaks French...
Of course, sir, that's why I've assigned a new man. And he's no ordinary Marshal. He's quite sophisticated. Three college degrees. A master of disguise. Speaks French...
French?
French?
Yes sir.
Yes sir.
French? Damn it, I want my own man on this case. Somebody I trust. Somebody who doesn't mind breaking up the furniture!
Why surely, Mr. President, there must be some mistake. I mean...
A mistake? To assign this case to the man who blew up all the bridges on the Chattanooga River and single- handedly trapped Jackson's entire cavalry? How is that a mistake?
Mr. President, good to see you again, sir. Sorry about all that.
That'll be all, boys.
Good work. Really.
This is Colonel Richards.
This is Colonel Richards.
Nice to finally meet you, sir.
But what would anyone have to gain from all this...? Unless it were a foreign power.
Exactly. Any number of nations would love to cripple our scientific growth. And what better way to tip the scales in their favor than by killing off the greatest minds this country has produced.
We find ourselves at the dawn of the Golden Age of Science. And it is the God-given destiny of this glorious nation to carry the torch that lights the way!
Nicely said, sir.
Nicely said, sir.
Part of some speech they wrote for this trip I'm taking.
Goddamnit! What am I doing? What's happened to all my cigars? Colonel Richards here has had a dozen agents on these cases for over a year. No arrests, no leads, no clues...
And?
And?
And now the job's yours.
... well, of course you can. Mr. President, what a surprise. What brings you here?
On my way to Denver...
Where'd he say he was going to do this?
He didn't. That's your job. I'm taking you off that other case until you've nabbed this lunatic. Good luck. Nice train. But mine's nicer.
I admire a man with a sense of humor.
When you're three and a half feet tall, sir, life turns you into a comedian whether you like it or not.... Come with me, won't you?
I must compliment you on Miss Thompson... an exceptionally charming assistant.
Thank you. I confess to a preoccupation with acquiring precisely that which the world says I cannot have.
Very good, sir! I think my guest might be a sharpshooter by trade.
No, sir... just a businessman.
No, sir... just a businessman.
Really? Must be a dangerous business.
Really? Must be a dangerous business.
I deal with some tough customers.
Sir... I believe you have only two barrels.
How embarrassing. Did I hold up three fingers?
Why don't we just cut this routine short? Whatever you do to us, we're not going to talk.
Talk? About what...? Oh! About who you are and all that?
... And do give me some room, Voltaire. You're breathing on my head! I hate it when you breath on my head!
Dr. Loveless?
You're not that big.
Restrain yourself, Voltaire. He's just the sort of coward who would shoot an unarmed giant.
Still alive. Hmm. I suppose that doesn't bode well for poor Bruno.
He had a pressing engagement.
He had a pressing engagement.
Philistine.
You got that right. Now get up. We're walking out of here.
Has it penetrated that adrenaline- addled skull that you are surrounded by seventy-eight of my loyal followers? You are in my domain!
Has it penetrated that adrenaline- addled skull that you are surrounded by seventy-eight of my loyal followers? You are in my domain!
Has it penetrated yours that I'm holding a gun on their leader?
The U.S. is my jurisdiction.
Exactly! You are on foreign soil. You are a representative of the occupying forces. Or haven't you checked a map lately?!
These lands were taken by force from Mexico in the illegal War of American Aggression.
That would be... the Mexican War?
That would be... the Mexican War?
Call it what you like. The point is, I was heir to that land, Mr. West. It belonged to my beloved grandmother! Now I intend to have it back. My own country!
I've even printed my own currency.
"Emperor Miguelito...?"
"Emperor Miguelito...?"
The first.
The first.
Well, your highness, what makes you think we'll ever sign a treaty with you?
Well, your highness, what makes you think we'll ever sign a treaty with you?
Because I am holding all the western territories hostage, Mr. West! A town a day will disappear! Willard was merely a test run, a stroll in the park. Next, I level all of Albuquerque! Yes, that's right. Only yesterday I learned what you undoubtedly already know: your own President will be there. What an added bonus! The gods are shining on me! After tomorrow

So, I'm the only one here who can tell the difference between an Emperor and a murderer?
Easy now.
Easy? Easy? On just what grounds should I take it easy!?
Dr. Pemberton?
Yes!
Gotta get the Doctor someplace safe.
Who were they? What do they want with me?
Who were they? What do they want with me?
We'll explain on the way.
I only met him once, but that was enough. For such a little man he had quite an oversized opinion of himself. He offered me the "rare and unparalleled opportunity" to develop a new steam engine for him. He claims to have some sort of factory in Texas, I believe. Said I could have the run of the place. He had all sorts of
Who was this partner of his?
Who was this partner of his?
A Southern gentlemen. I don't recall his name. I suppose it's unkind of me to say it, but he had the most disconcerting glass eye.
A Southern gentlemen. I don't recall his name. I suppose it's unkind of me to say it, but he had the most disconcerting glass eye.
A glass eye? That's who it was! One-Eyed Jack Garrison. Otherwise known as General Garrison, Confederate Third Army. I saw him at Dr. Loveless' party, but I couldn't place him. He used to wear an eye-patch.
Are you all right?
For the moment. But I fear not for long. I'm of no use to him now.
He... he's planning to kill us, isn't he?
He's just full of plans that aren't gonna work out.
This is something.
It's a smelting retort.
Now it's a bomb.
It is?
I beg your pardon?
You don't know what he's built?! Surely you don't think he kidnapped all those geniuses to have them make something as rudimentary as this.
Well?
They're coming.
They're coming.
When are they coming?
When are they coming?
They're rounding up a posse. Figure an hour?
They're rounding up a posse. Figure an hour?
In an hour they're gone!
Hey...!
You're not going to use it, are you?
You're not going to use it, are you?
Well, come on, that's half a dozen armed men...
Well, come on, that's half a dozen armed men...
Right.
We're going into battle, little one. Find a woman to take care of it.
He thought you were a woman, Airk!
Madmartigan! What did you do this time?
Nothing you wouldn't have done it my place!
I always knew you'd end up in a crow's cage.
Least I'm not down there herding sheep!
Airk! Come on, Airk. Lemme outa here.
Hey, remember? You don't need my help, Madmartigan. Little rabbit trap like this? Come on! I could open it for you, but I wouldn't wanna insult you!
Hey, remember? You don't need my help, Madmartigan. Little rabbit trap like this? Come on! I could open it for you, but I wouldn't wanna insult you!
Gimme a sword, Airk. I'll win your war for you.
You left me to die, friend.
You managed alright.
You managed alright.
Is this what's left of your army?
It's you they're after, Madmarti- gan. What did you do this time?
They're not after me. They want the baby.
You gonna be a hero, Madmartigan? I've lost half my men fighting Kael, and Bavmorda, and the Nock- maar army. Now you and this Peck, and that magpie up in the rafters, are gonna take 'em on alone?
Then come with us.
You're chasing a dream.
Just get me some horses.
Out for a little ride in the coun- try, Airk?
Thought you might get lonely, Mad- martigan!
Thank you, friend.
Let's go.
Willow Ufgood.
Yes...?
Yes...?
I hope you are comfortable here, inside my kingdom...
You mean, you know who this baby belongs to?
She belongs to all of us. She is the future queen and ruler of all kingdoms on earth.
No, Willow. Your journey has just begun. It has been foretold that this child shall bring about the downfall of Queen Bavmorda, whose evil powers have darkened our world. Upon you depends this princess's life.
Me?
You are the guardian, Willow. You must take her to Tir Asleen.
What is Tir Asleen?
The way has been lost in time. But there is one person, a druid sor- ceress, who might guide you there. She was exiled by Queen Bavmorda many years ago. Her name is Fin Raziel.
You need a warrior for this job. I'm nobody.
You need a warrior for this job. I'm nobody.
You are very important, Willow.
You are very important, Willow.
No I'm not. Have you really looked at me? I'm short! Even for a Nelwyn!
Why can't you do it? You have mag- ical powers.
My prsence cannot extend beyond this forest. But I can give you these...
They look like acorns.
Anything you hurl them at will turn to stone.
Sir! I have to talk to you.
Not today, Willow.
Not today, Willow.
It's a matter of great importance to me!
Earlier today you tried to tell me something, Willow.
My family found this baby in the river, High Aldwin.
Now, you know where you're going? Down there, through those trees, follow the river. You'll know the crossroads by a big daikini struc- ture. Willow, this is serious business. Don't waste any time, the outer world is no place for a Nelwyn. Give the baby to the first daikini you see, then hurry home as fast as you can.
If I'm not strong enough to be your apprentice, how can I do this?
If I'm not strong enough to be your apprentice, how can I do this?
You're strong enough. But you're going to need courage, Willow.
You're strong enough. But you're going to need courage, Willow.
I don't want courage. I don't want to be a warrior. All I've ever wanted was to do magic, real magic, like you!
I don't want courage. I don't want to be a warrior. All I've ever wanted was to do magic, real magic, like you!
Real magic, Willow, is simply the art of controlling the reality of others. You lack faith in your- self. You must learn to trust your intuition.
Go in the direction the bird is flying.
Oh, if I could do that I'd--I'd turn Burglekutt into a toad!
Oh, if I could do that I'd--I'd turn Burglekutt into a toad!
Waste magic on revenge? You have much to learn, Willow...
You! Are you the mother of that child?
No. I mean yes.
I can't.
Let me see it.
I can't.
Why not?
Why not?
Why not?
Gawd...you're...beautiful...
You're not a woman.
Mmmm, I love the smell of a woman.
My step-father's going to tear you apart.
I do what I'm told.
Too bad you're not more like your father.
You're a fool. Now put her back.
I'm not going to let this baby die.
Why did you say that?
Say what?
Say what?
I love you.
Because it's true.
I don't believe you.
Sorsha.
Madmartigan.
We'll probably die here, Sorsha.
I have no family.
Willow, why don't you use your mag- ic to get us out of here?
He's no magician.
He's no magician.
He turned that monster into stone!
Then you get us out of here.
I will! But I need help!
Who is that girl, anyway?
Sorsha, Queen Bavmorda's daughter.
We're a tiny version of all that?
As above, so below.
Bavmorda cannot transform you. I've protected this camp with a spell.
Can you use your magic to get our men into the fortress, Raziel?
Please? I'm dyin' of thirst in here.
Good. How long will it take?
Don't make me angry, Peck.
You be careful. I'm a powerful sorcerer. I could turn you into a toad just like that.
You be careful. I'm a powerful sorcerer. I could turn you into a toad just like that.
Miserable Pecks.
Do any other daikinis ever come by here?
Why.
Why.
I have to give this baby to some- body.
Hey! Somebody's coming!
Peck! Quick! Douse the fire!
Thanks for your help, Peck.
Are you okay?
Are you okay?
As if you care. I saved your life, Peck. Those guys woulda killed us! You wanna give your baby to them?? They eat babies!
As if you care. I saved your life, Peck. Those guys woulda killed us! You wanna give your baby to them?? They eat babies!
I don't know.
You a woodcutter?
Farmer.
Farmer.
Farmer! I knew it! You're a vic- tim, Willow. Yep, you and me: victims of a rotten, corrupt, cor- rupt, rotten world.
You all right?
These burns. My arms. Ouch...
Smells like a battle.
Are you a warrior?
Are you a warrior?
The greatest swordsman that ever lived.
What's that? I hear something!
You hear trouble.
You hear trouble.
What is it?
I'll be around long after you're dead, Airk! You slime! When I get outa here I'll cut your head off and stick it on a pig-pole!
Friend of yours?
Whatcha thinkin' about, Willow?
I hate this.
Nobody's gonna take your baby. Know why? Nobody cares... Except me. You wanna go back to your farm. You wanna go back to your family. I could take care of that baby. I'll look after her like she was me own.
You don't know anything about ba- bies.
You gotta promise to feed her.
I will.
I will.
Fresh goat's milk.
Fresh goat's milk.
Absolutely!
And give her a bath everyday, and don't let her get cold. And keep her diaper changed.
Of course! I promise!
Here are her diaper rags. And this is her milk bladder. And when she cries--she's either hungry or she's tired--rock her on your left shoulder. She likes that.
Don't worry, Willow. She's in good hands. You haven't made a mistake.
You!!
Where the hell did you come from?
Hey! Give me that baby!
These Pecks make terrible nurse- maids.
These Pecks make terrible nurse- maids.
Nursemaid?!
Time to change her diaper.
Time to leave.
Because she's sick.
Because she's sick.
Where's the baby??
I thought you had her!
Now Willow, I know you're gonna blame me for this but it wasn't my fault...!
Elora Danan!
When I left the crossroads, I got ambushed by an elf!
Madmartigan! You saved her life!
Madmartigan! You saved her life!
I did?
So you're on your way to Tir Asleen, huh? I hate to tell you this, Willow, but Tir Asleen dosn't exist.
Yes it does. The Fairy Queen told me.
Yes it does. The Fairy Queen told me.
The Fairy Queen? And the baby here's a princess? And these two rodents are your guides?
Madmartigan, I need your help.
My help? A great magician like you? You don't need any help.
I was in love once, Willow. She had a hold on my heart. I could barely function. I *was* a great swordsman! I was knighted! I could have been king!
You?
You?
Yeah me. King! But she betrayed me. She robbed me of my dream.
I'll help you...!
I won't.
I'm beginning to think you two *deserve* to be locked up.
The universe is a living creature, like you and me, Madmartigan.
Did she ask about me?
Who?
Who?
Come on, Peck, don't give me a hard time. You were in her ten all night. Did she say anything?
She said lots of thing.s
Willow!
She asked about you, Madmartigan.
Well what did she say?
She's in love.
You're crazy. I think you're in love.
You?
What are you gonna become, Raziel? Queen of the rodents?
Madmartigan! I can't stand being in closed-in places.
Want me to carry Elora?
Want me to carry Elora?
I'm used to her. How's she doing?
Willow...this may be a bad time to ask this question but...what if Raziel's wrong?
She can't be wrong. She's a very very very powerful sorceress.
She can't be wrong. She's a very very very powerful sorceress.
She's a bird, Willow.
She's a bird, Willow.
That's my fault, not hers. I've got to keep practicing. I'm still in the learning stage but magic, Madmartigan, requires concentration and--
That's my fault, not hers. I've got to keep practicing. I'm still in the learning stage but magic, Madmartigan, requires concentration and--
Watch it!
Watch it!
Ahhh!
I have an idea. Back in my village we catch a lot of hedgehogs.
Willow, this is war, not agricul- ture!
Willow, this is war, not agricul- ture!
I know, I know! But this is a way to get into that castle...
I don't know, Willow.
Madmartigan, you promised me you'd take care of Elora Danan like your own daughter. She is all that matters. Are you going to abandon her?
It's not a Nelwyn baby.
No, it's too big to be a Nelwyn baby. It looks like a daikini...
Can't we keep it, Dada?
Absolutely not.
Dada, what's a daikini?
Daikinis are giant people who live far far away.
Daikinis are giant people who live far far away.
Are you scared?
I could be you rguard! I could carry your spear!
What a great son you are, Ranon. I wish I could take you with me. Now go to sleep...
Who are you! Who are you!
I'm Willow Ufgood. I'm here to find Fin Raziel.
What do you want!
We need your help. To take this baby to Tir Asleen. She's a prin- cess.
Kill him!
No!
No!
Kill him!
Did *you* give that acorn its power?
No.
No.
A magician *makes* magic. Any fool can use it.
You must learn magic.
That's all I ever wanted!
That's all I ever wanted!
Then I will teach you.
Willow. To learn magic, first you must make your own philosopher's stone!
What do I need for that?
What do I need for that?
We must start with feathers, dung, and a lock of your hair.
I hope she's all right. How much more do I have to do of this?
Till it's in a powder. The energy exits within you...
Till it's in a powder. The energy exits within you...
I know, and the magician's goal is to find his true self. But what's this got to do with it?
I know, and the magician's goal is to find his true self. But what's this got to do with it?
As below, so above. You hold the univers, Willow, in your hand.
I'm all finished. Now what?
Burn it to a fine ash.
How am I gonna do that?
Patience. Concentrate. You will find a way.
We don't have much time left! Go on! Go on!
I must concetrate my imagination...to creat a new...reality!
I must concetrate my imagination...to creat a new...reality!
What's the magician's weapon?
What's the magician's weapon?
The limitless power of...
Your will! Your will! What else could it be?
I can't remember all these things. What am I learning?
I can't remember all these things. What am I learning?
The art of transformation!
But what am I gonna transform??
Me!
Oooh, this smells terrible.
That's the life spark. Exxence of magic and sorcery!
Ouch!!
Shhhhh!
What'd you bit me for!!
We need blood. To nourish the stone. charge the stone with ener- gy.
Again: what is the magician's weapon?
His will.
His will.
Now use it.
I just wanted to test it first.
No! Change me back into a sor- ceress, Willow.
Tir Asleen.
There's nobody here.
How??
Use the philosopher's stone! Hur- ry! Invocation! Release them!
I did it! Madmartigan! Come here! Look! You gotta see this! I did it!
More! More!
Raziel! I transformed them all! I'm a magician!
You didn't transform them, Willow, you released them. That was noth- ing. Now change me.
Get down! The ritual chant! Quick! Protect yourself!
Why?
Why?
Just do it!
I've come all this way and now Elora Dana's going to die!
No! I can still defeat Bavmorda!
No! I can still defeat Bavmorda!
She's too powerful, Raziel
Time is running out.
Surrender!!
Patience, Willow.
Courage, Willow.
Elves! They're always tormenting babies. They make them cry and take their tears.
Somebody has to do it.
Watch this. Right between the eyes.
He never misses.
I'm not going in there.
Me neither!
Are you sure?
Yes! Raziel! She lives out on that island!
We gotta follow them.
Us?? We'll never catch them. Any- way, we're all done, Teemo. Let's go home.
Get back here, Rool!
Ouch! Let go of me!
If you rest the baby on your shoulder, she'll stop crying.
Shut up.
She needs to be changed.
I changed her already!
She needs to be changed again. Sorsha crosses her arms in a hugg and watches as Willow changes the baby. Soon the baby stops crying. Re- lieved yet still anxious, Sorsha paces to a mirror. Willow rocks the baby gently, absently looking at the fire. Then his eyes focus on the fire.
Who is that horrible friend of yours?
Who is that horrible friend of yours?
Madmartigan.
Madmartigan.
Who is he?
Who is he?
I don't know much about him.
She's hungry.
I know she's hungry. I tried to feed her but she wouldn't eat a thing. I'm not a wet nurse.
I know she's hungry. I tried to feed her but she wouldn't eat a thing. I'm not a wet nurse.
Here. Hold her.
We are emissaries of her majesty, Queen Cherlindrea, of the land of Coshairm.
Queen Cherlindrea?
Queen Cherlindrea?
She requests the presence of your- self and the young princess.
She requests the presence of your- self and the young princess.
Who??
Who??
You're the guardian, aren't you?
I'm getting her out of there!
No! You let us handle this. Come along, Rool!
Ohhh, I hate this.
Take your time. Don't worry about the elves. They won't come out here.
Take your time. Don't worry about the elves. They won't come out here.
Why not?
This is not going well.
Hurry! Queen Cherlindrea will know what to do.
Talk! Say something!
I can't see anything--she's too bright!
Hey, careful there!
How do these work I wonder? I got- ta save one to show the High Aldwin.
Its branches are supposed to be made of gold, solid gold.
How are we going to get out there?
We've traveled a long way. We're looking for Fin Raziel.
The sorceress.
Obviously.
Without Raziel we'll never find Tir Asleen. We'd better go.
This can't be right. This isn't a sorceress. This is some kind of animal.
Queen Bavmorda transformed her.
Sure, I'm sorry. Hope you don't mind me plugging in to your battery. Mine's dead... How can I help? What can I do?
Maybe milking.
Maybe milking.
Milking?
Milking?
Cows. You know, cows?
Cows. You know, cows?
I've seen pictures.
I've seen pictures.
Good, you start tomorrow.
Didn't you hear me, Book? Pull! You never had your hands on a teat before?
Not one this big.
Eat up, Book. What's the matter with your appetite?
Guess I'm not used to so much.
Guess I'm not used to so much.
Not used to hard work. That's what makes an appetite.
How could you do this to me tonight? I told you I had company
Sorry. It's important.
Where's Timmy and Buck?
Upstairs, asleep. Where'd you think?
Upstairs, asleep. Where'd you think?
You've got a man here and the kids are upstairs?
You've got a man here and the kids are upstairs?
That's none of your goddamn business! So keep your goddamn holier-than- thou mouth shut! Anyway, they like Fred.
That's none of your goddamn business! So keep your goddamn holier-than- thou mouth shut! Anyway, they like Fred.
Oh sure, Fred.
Who are these orphans, anyway?
They're Amish.
Put my car in the garage and close the door.
John, I don't understand any of this.
John, I don't understand any of this.
You don't know anything... borrowed your car. Didn't say why. And you never heard of that woman and her boy.
You don't know anything... borrowed your car. Didn't say why. And you never heard of that woman and her boy.
John, why?...
John, why?...
Just do it!
Good morning. Book, is it? You are the Yankee they talk about?
I thought I was the English.
I thought I was the English.
English, Yankee. It's the same. My name is Daniel. Daniel Hochstetler. You look plain, Book. Very plain.
I came to see Rachel Lapp.
Try the house.
Eli says you're a carpenter, Book.
It's been a while.
It's been a while.
No matter. Come with me. We can always use a good carpenter.
Your hole is healed, then?
Pretty much.
Nail it!
Yes, sir.
Everything is all right, John.
Pick up the hat.
I saw him.
Who'd you see?
Who'd you see, Sam? The man on the floor?
No... I saw the man who killed him.
He was... like him.
Black... I understand. What else,Sam?
You ever handle a pistol like this, Samuel?
No pistol. Ever.
No pistol. Ever.
Tell you what  I'm going to let you handle this one. But only if you promise not to say anything to your momma. I've got a feeling she wouldn't understand.

You don't say.
Hey, Sam...
...I want to say a thing.

Don't let them hurt you.
I won't. Now run. Fast as you can!
Are you really ever coming back?
Got to, Sam. You and I are going to a courthouse together, put some people behind bars.

That's the problem. We need results. The press is driving us crazy over this P2P thing. Calling us the 'speed capitol of the country'. You know the sort of thing. It's getting political. The Commissioner's getting very uneasy.

When word gets out that Zenovitch was a cop, all hell will break lose. You've got 24 hours. That's all I can give you. 24 hours on your own. After that the case and the witness go back to the Homicide Department.

Last guy I would have figured. But he's part of it.
I hope you don't have any doubts about that.
I hope you don't have any doubts about that.
If I did, I'd have kept my mouth shut... It fits, Paul... Fifty-five gallons of P2P confiscated four years ago... Guess who was in on the collar? Mac. He salts it away somewhere... he knows the stuff is potent, but the street chemists haven't figured out how to process it. But they do now. And now the stuff is worth five-grand a pint and

Maybe the Bureau. Or those bastards at Treasury. I'll take care of it. I hate this shit, Johnny. You cut their balls off for me. I'm counting on you.
What's your first move?
A hot shower... I haven't changed clothes in two days.
Who else knows?
Just us.
You made a mistake, Paul. You shouldn't have taken Elton out.
How bad did Mac get you? We figured pretty bad.

I've already got something worked out. Be seeing you.
You're going to have to do it right here, Schaeffer.
Don't try me, Johnny!
It's all over, Paul.
Move! Or you die right here!
I'm a police officer. I'm going to have to talk to the boy. What's his name?
Samuel. Samuel Lapp. But what happened here is none of his affair. My sister is expecting me... our train is leaving soon.
Samuel. Samuel Lapp. But what happened here is none of his affair. My sister is expecting me... our train is leaving soon.
There'll be another train. The man who was killed tonight was a policeman, Sam. It's my job to find out who did it. I want you to tell me everything you saw when you went in there.
Where are you taking us?
We're looking for a suspect. We've reason to believe he's still in the area.

It's not a joke.
What was that?
He wants to know who you are. Your name. I told him we don't need to know anything about you.
Now what's the problem?
The problem is I don't happen to think my son should be spending all his time with a man who carried a gun under his coat and goes around whacking people.
Whacking?
Yes. And I also want to leave this city.
Yes. And I also want to leave this city.
Believe me, I'm trying to get this over with as fast as I can. But Samuel will probably have to come back and testify.

Look, I'm genuinely sorry...
No you're not  You're glad, because now you've got a witness. I heard the other police talking last night. They don't seem to like you very much.

I would not be too sure.
But not a good tired.
What's a 'good' tired. Tired is tired.
Your sister said you don't have a family?
No.
No.
She thinks you should get married and have children of your own. Instead of trying to be a father to hers. Except she thinks you're afraid of the responsibility.
Oh? Anything else?
Oh yes. She thinks you like policing because you think you're right about everything. And you're the only one who can do anything. And that when you drink a lot of beer you say things like none of the other police would know a crook from a... um... bag of elbows.
Why don't you arrest that man? Are you protecting him because policeman?
Listen, I'm the cop that polices the police. I'm not in the business of protecting crooked cops. I'll make an arrest when I know everybody involved.
But why would they murder...
Because  somehow  they knew I was getting close. Look, it's narcotics... They make dope out of chemicals... they sell it on the street for millions of dollars. They'll do anything. And they can get away with it because they're cops.

I was wrong.
Stay for awhile. Rest. I'll make coffee and breakfast.
I can't.

What about Samuel? Will you come back to take him to trial?

No, no doctor...

Gunshot... they'll file reports... they'll find me.
Gunshot... they'll file reports... they'll find me.
But 
Who are they?
The leadership of our district... the diener. Bishop Tschantz is the one with no hair on top. They decided to come and see you for themselves. Except Stoltzfus, of course. He came the first day. I think he saved your life.

Tell him his tea stinks.
You tell him. When you're able.
John Book, I would appreciate it if, during the time you are with us, you would have as little to do with Samuel as possible.
Nobody meant any harm. The boy was curious. I unloaded the gun -

Your shirt and jacket are still stained with blood. I have them soaking.You can wear these.
Your husband's?

When will you be going?
Not long... A few days.
Won him over just like that.
I see. But I hope you have a lot of sugar. Eli is ready to go to Zook's.
You should not bother with that birdhouse. If you're leaving tomorrow.
I'm leaving tonight. I'm going to need my clothes. And my gun.

Who was that man?
His name is John Book.
Is the English dead?
No...
No...
Looks dead...
That has no place in this house.
I know.
Didn't you hear Stoltzfus? What if he dies? Then the sheriff will come. They'll say we broke their laws 

No, Aunt Em -- this was a real, truly live place. And I remember that some of it wasn't very nice....
Poor little orphan, and her Miss Gulch troubles. Gosh all hemlock - you know, she ought to have somebody to play with.
I know, but we all got to work out our own problems, Henry.
I know, but we all got to work out our own problems, Henry.
Yes.
Yes.
Oh, I hope we got them in time.
Oh, I hope we got them in time.
Yes.
Uhh -- yeah --
Now, we can't go against the law, Dorothy. I'm afraid poor Toto will have to go.
Look at you, Zeke -- you're just as white --
Here, here, what's all this jabber-wapping when there's work to be done? I know three shiftless farm hands that'll be out of a job before they know it!

All right, Mrs. Gale. But some day they're going to erect a statue to me in this town, and --
Well, don't start posing for it now. Here, here -- can't work on an empty stomach. Have some crullers.
As Mayor of the Munchkin City In the County of the Land of Oz I welcome you most regally
But we've got to verify it legally To see...

To see?
To see?
If she...

If she?
If she?
Is morally, ethic'ly
Then this is a day of Independence For all the Munchkins and their descendants!
If any!
If any!
Yes, let the joyous news be spread.
From now on you'll be history
You'll be hist...
Our echo.
Tap - tap - tap - tap - What was that - that - that? Our echo - echo - echo.
Oh, come on - come on! We'll soon find the Wizard!
The Wizard - The Wizard - The Great and Powerful Wizard of Oz - Oz - Oz-Oz - Oz - Oz - Oz - Oz!
...have you come back?
Please, sir. We've done what you told us. We've brought you the broomstick of the Wicked Witch of the West. We melted her.
Please, sir. We've done what you told us. We've brought you the broomstick of the Wicked Witch of the West. We melted her.
Oh ....
...resourceful!
Yes, sir. So we'd like you to keep your promise to us, if you please, sir.
Yes, sir. So we'd like you to keep your promise to us, if you please, sir.
Not so fast! Not....
If you were really great and powerful, you'd keep your promises!
Do you presume to criticize the....
... -- Oz -- has spoken!
Who are you?
Who are you?
Well, I -- I -- I am the Great and Powerful -- Wizard of Oz.
Well, I -- I -- I am the Great and Powerful -- Wizard of Oz.
You are?
Uhhhh -- yes...
I don't believe you!
I don't believe you!
No, I'm afraid it's true. There's no other Wizard except me.
Yes-s-s -- that...that's exactly so. I'm a humbug!
Oh ....
Frightened? You are talking to a man who has laughed in the face of death -- sneered at doom and chuckled at catastrophe. I was petrified. Then suddenly the wind changed, and the balloon floated down into the heart of this noble city, where I was instantly acclaimed Oz, the First Wizard de Luxe!
Ohhh!
Ohhh!
Times being what they were, I accepted the job, -- retaining my balloon against the advent of a quick get-away. And in that balloon, my dear Dorothy, you and I will return to the land of E Pluribus Unum!
Oh! Come back! Don't go without me! Please come back!
I can't come back! I don't know how it works!
I can't come back! I don't know how it works!
Oh --
Oh --
Goodbye, folks!
Oh! Oh, it feels like my joints are rusted. Listen, Dorothy, don't let Hunk kid you about Miss Gulch. She's just a poor sour-faced old maid that -- she ain't got no heart left. You know, you should have a little more heart yourself, and have pity on her.
Well, gee, I try and have a heart.
Well, gee, I try and have a heart.
Now look, here's something that really has a heart. This is the best invention I ever invented.
Now look, here's something that really has a heart. This is the best invention I ever invented.
This?
This?
Sure. It's to break up winds, so we don't have no more dust storms. Can you imagine what it'll mean to this section of the country? I'll show you. It works perfectly now. Here's the principle. You see that fan -- that sends up air currents into the sky. These air currents -- Oh, stop it!

Oh!
Who did it? Now wait a minute.
Who did it? Now wait a minute.
Hickory!
Hickory!
Now what happened? I'll bet Hunk did that.
Oh! Oh, Zeke! Help! Help me, Zeke! Get me out of here! Help!
Are you all right, Dorothy?
Are you all right, Dorothy?
Yes, I'm all right. Oh -- I fell in and -- and Zeke --
...didn't you?
No -- No! It was an accident! I didn't mean to kill anybody!....
What are you going to do with my dog? Give him back to me!
All in good time, my little pretty -- all in good time.
All in good time, my little pretty -- all in good time.
Oh, please give me back my dog!
Oh, please give me back my dog!
Certainly -- certainly -- when you give me those slippers.
Certainly -- certainly -- when you give me those slippers.
But the Good Witch of the North told me not to.
But the Good Witch of the North told me not to.
Very well! Throw that basket in the river and drown him!
No! No -- no! Here -- you can have your old slippers -- but give me back Toto.
That's a good little girl. I knew you'd see reason.
Ahh! Ah!
I'm sorry. I didn't do it! Can I still have my dog?
I'm sorry. I didn't do it! Can I still have my dog?
No! Fool, that I am! I should have remembered -- those slippers will never come off, as long as...
Run, Toto, run!
Catch him, you fool!
Are you a good witch, or a bad witch?
Who, me? Why, I'm not a witch at all. I'm Dorothy Gale from Kansas.
Who, me? Why, I'm not a witch at all. I'm Dorothy Gale from Kansas.
Oh! Well....
Toto's my dog.
Well, I'm a little muddled. The Munchkins called me because a new witch has just dropped a house on the Wicked Witch of the East. And there's the house, and here you are, and that's all...
The Munchkins are happy because you have freed them from the Wicked Witch of the East.
Oh. But, if you please -- what are Munchkins?
Oh. But, if you please -- what are Munchkins?
The little people who live in this land -- it's Munchkinland, and you are their national heroine, my dear. It's all right -- you may all come out and thank her. It's all right now - you may all come out.
I thought you said she was dead.
That was her sister -- the Wicked Witch of the East. This is the Wicked Witch of the West. And she's worse than the other one was.
Pooh -- what a smell of sulphur! I'm afraid you've made rather a bad enemy of the Wicked Witch of the West. The sooner you get out of Oz altogether, the safer you'll sleep, my dear.
Oh, I'd give anything to get out of Oz altogether -- but which is the way back to Kansas? I can't go the way I came.
Oh, I'd give anything to get out of Oz altogether -- but which is the way back to Kansas? I can't go the way I came.
No -- that's true. The only person who might know would be the great and wonderful Wizard of Oz himself!
No -- that's true. The only person who might know would be the great and wonderful Wizard of Oz himself!
The Wizard of Oz? Is he good or is he wicked?
The Wizard of Oz? Is he good or is he wicked?
Oh, very good, but very mysterious. He lives in the Emerald City, and that's a long journey from here. Did you bring your broomstick with you?
Oh, very good, but very mysterious. He lives in the Emerald City, and that's a long journey from here. Did you bring your broomstick with you?
No, I'm afraid I didn't.
No, I'm afraid I didn't.
Well, then, you'll have to walk. The Munchkins will see you safely to the border of Munchkinland. And remember, never let those ruby slippers off your feet for a moment, or you will be at the mercy of the Wicked Witch of the West.

But, how do I start for Emerald City?
But, how do I start for Emerald City?
It's always best to start at the beginning -- and all you do is follow the Yellow Brick Road.
Oh, will you help me? Can you help me?
You don't need to be helped any longer. You've always had the power to go back to Kansas.
You don't need to be helped any longer. You've always had the power to go back to Kansas.
I have?
...Toto, too?
Toto, too.
Toto, too.
Oh, now?
Oh, now?
Whenever you wish.
Whenever you wish.
Oh, dear -- that's too wonderful to be true! Oh, it's -- it's going to be so hard to say goodbye. I love you all, too. Goodbye, Tin Man. Oh, don't cry. You'll rust so dreadfully. Here -- here's your oil-can. Goodbye.
Are you ready now?
Yes. Say goodbye, Toto.
Yes, I'm ready now.
Then close your eyes, and tap your heels together three times.
And think to yourself -- "There's no place like home; there's no place like home; there's no place like home."
There's no place like home. There's no place like home. There's no place like home. There's no place like home.
Let's see -- you're -- you're travelling in disguise. No, that's not right. I -- you're -- you're going on a visit. No, I'm wrong. That's...You're -- running away.
How did you guess?
How did you guess?
Professor Marvel never guesses -- he knows! Now, why are you running away?
Professor Marvel never guesses -- he knows! Now, why are you running away?
Why --
Why --
No, no -- now don't tell me. They -- they don't understand you at home. They don't appreciate you. You want to see other lands -- big cities -- big mountains -- big oceans --
No, no -- now don't tell me. They -- they don't understand you at home. They don't appreciate you. You want to see other lands -- big cities -- big mountains -- big oceans --
Why, it's just like you could read what was inside of me.
Yes --
Please, Professor, why can't we go along with you?
Oh, yes - you - you wanted to go home, huh?
Oh, no, I wanted to go along with you.
Oh, no, I wanted to go along with you.
Oh --
Oh --
Nobody cares about me at home. They wouldn't even miss me.
Nobody cares about me at home. They wouldn't even miss me.
Aw, come, come, come --
Aw, come, come, come --
No, they won't - honestly.
No, they won't - honestly.
Oh --
Oh --
Auntie Em was even going to let them kill Toto yesterday for biting Miss Gulch. Oh, please, Professor, why can't we go with you and see all the Crowned Heads of Europe?

Do you know any? Oh, you mean the thing -- Yes, well, I -- I never do anything without consulting my crystal first. Let's....
That's our farm!
Oh -- yes.
...her face is careworn.
Yes...That's Aunt Em.
Yes...That's Aunt Em.
Her -- her name is Emily.
That's right. What's she doing?
Well, I -- I can't quite see. Why, she's crying.
Well, I -- I can't quite see. Why, she's crying.
Oh --
Oh --
Someone has hurt her -- someone has just about broken her heart.
Someone has hurt her -- someone has just about broken her heart.
Me?
I had the measles once -- and she stayed right by me every minute.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
What's she doing now?
...room --
Has it poppies on the wall....
...paper?
I said it had poppies on the wall paper! Eh -- she's -- What's this? Why, she's -- she's putting her hand on her heart -- she's -- she's dropping down on the....
...bed.
Oh, no -- no!
Oh, no -- no!
That's all -- the Crystal's gone dark.
That's all -- the Crystal's gone dark.
Oh, you....
...you don't suppose she could really be sick, do you? Oh -- Oh, I've got to go home right away!
But -- what's this? I thought you were going along with me.
But -- what's this? I thought you were going along with me.
Oh, no, no, I have to get to her right....
