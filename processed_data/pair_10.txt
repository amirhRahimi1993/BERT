Typing and clicking myself to renderings isn't why I started building models.
All of us are typing and clicking, George. Whether we want to, or not.
All of us are typing and clicking, George. Whether we want to, or not.
I'm not.
I'm not.
Which is why we bid out a quarter of our projects. It doesn't make a lot of sense anymore to want what we don't have and don't want what we do.
I've been here twenty years.
Maybe that's too long.
Maybe that's too long.
Maybe...?
Maybe...?
That's too long.
Oh.
How old are you?
How old are you?
Forty.
Forty.
We were probably in school together. You went to Berkley?
Class of eighty-six! I didn't know you were there.
I was a sophomore when I got the call my parents were dead.
Listen...maybe I can get you a year.
I hate this job.
I hate this job.
What are you talking about? You love your job.
What are you talking about? You love your job.
From the day I started...to today. Can't stand it.
Then it sounds like I'm doing you a favor.
It may sound that way, but I react out of fear. My life has nothing to do with what I like or don't like. You haven't been listening, have you?

I didn't know there would be a quiz, George.

For everything.

Well, I feel better about this now.
Well, I feel better about this now.
Good. I was hoping for that.
I've got one favor to ask.
What can I do for you, George?
What can I do for you, George?
I built my first model here when I was twenty. There are hundreds of them on shelves around the office. Twenty years of my life. I was wondering if I might be able to pick a few to keep, to take home? Only the ones that really mean something to me.
Oh, well...those are...I mean, we don't get to keep our work. I could maybe ask them if you could choose one. But, you know, frankly George, you were the best. Computer models can't begin to match the beauty you gave yours. They're a part of this firm. They inspire me. I go out there and sometimes just stare at something I've designed. It amazes
Thank you.
Thank you.
Well, it's the least I can do.

Yes, it is.

Not a shower.
Thanks for the shower.
I want you both to stay.
Come over anytime you need to, Sam.

It's midnight. What's the matter, Sam?
It's midnight. What's the matter, Sam?
Nothing. My dad's dying. I really need to talk to Alyssa.
This has got to stop!
He escaped. He's going back in.

My life is a warning. I just can't figure out for what.
I forgot where I put my keys.
And you thought they might be under her dress?
Hello?
Where are you? You're driving me crazy, waiting like this. I want you in me now!
The whole summer, man. Party in Tahoe.
I don't know.
I don't know.
It'll just be my brother the dweeb on weekends. All we gotta do is sand and paint the cabin, dude. My dad's gonna let me use the boat and my charm is gonna let me use my rod. Income village is the place to hook up with hump.

Hey, it beats letting town folk go down on you for the summer.
I never said anything. I haven't done anything.

Why would you be there?

You live in Cory's parents' cabin?
Did you tell him he's spending the summer with me?
No I'm not!
Who are you, anyway? I don't even know you.
You'll know me by the time we're through.
You'll know me by the time we're through.
I'm not going!

I'll get your bag.
Mom, tell him I'm not going. You already promised me!
You have everything?
I'm not going!
You don't have a choice.
You don't have a choice.
Mom...please.
Your nose ring comes out of your nose. If you've got them in your nipples, they come out, too. And there's no make-up at my house. No glue sniffing. Huffing. No pills, no grass.
If you hit me, I'll call the police.
If you hit me, I'll call the police.
You've worn out your welcome at this house, Sam. I won't ever hit you. This may well be the worst three months of your life, but you've earned it. So, pick up your suitcase and go get in the truck. Now.

I'll hate you forever.
I'll hate you forever.
You can't even begins to know how much I hate my father. Think of it as a family tradition.
Are you totally insane?!
I almost saw Catalina.
Probably in the bible.
Goodnight.
What are you doing?!
I warned you yesterday.
I warned you yesterday.
Don't touch me! You can't touch me!
Do you ever get like the slightest inkling that you might want to help me instead of doing absolutely nothing?
No.
No.
Get the inkling, Sam. I'm getting tired of your attitude.
I hate turkey.
No you don't.
I want you to take out your nose ring and leave it out.
Why?
Why?
It bugs me.
It bugs me.
You snore at night. That bugs me. Can I take you out?
You snore at night. That bugs me. Can I take you out?
Your brothers are right. It was the most god-awful smell I've ever had my nose around.
I don't know.
I'm gonna take a walk. I need some money.

You'll have money when you work.

No one would blame me if I left!

I'm not doing it!

It'll be fine.
It'll be fine.
Why don't you just beg some money off my dad and move into something decent with a real kitchen and a real bathroom?
Why don't you just beg some money off my dad and move into something decent with a real kitchen and a real bathroom?

I can promise you complete privacy.
I can promise you complete privacy.
You can't promise me anything! You don't have anything to promise! You live in a garage! You don't have cable! You're not hooked up to the internet because you don't even own a computer! You don't have a job!
If you had a stupid phone or I could use your truck, mom would give me some money.
You'll have money when you work for it.
I'm leaving.
Hey...hey!
Where are you going?
I don't know.
I don't know.
When are you going to be back?

A friend of yours is here.

Did you got through my pants?

I might have a solution.
I've been using since I was twelve! You're all so unbelievably stupid. You didn't give a shit about anything I did until now!
I'll apologize for everything but today...Today I give a shit.

Sit down for a second.

No.
Oh, so you're in the big shit now! Child abuse. People go to prison for what you just did to me.
My dad used to play a game. I never really understood what it was until after he was gone.
I was holding for someone. That wasn't even mine.
The game was to make me smaller than he was. No matter what. He could be almost invisible as a human being, but I had to be smaller. So if I got good grades, I was a pussy for not playing football. If I cut my hair for him, it wasn't short enough. If I shaved it, I looked like a psycho. I never
I'll have to pay him back.
I won't ever hit you. I don't want you smaller. I want you to be happy. You're not. Not here with me. Not home with your mother. Not up in Tahoe. Not alone. Not anywhere. You're what I was most of my life, Sam. I see it in your eyes. In your sleep. In your answer to everything. You're barely alive.

I'm not even listening.
I'm not even listening.
You know that great thing, though? Is that change can be so constant you don't even feel the difference until there is one. It can be so slow that you don't even notice that your life is better or worse, until it is. Or it can just blow you away. Make you something different in an instant. It happened to me.
Twenty years of hating what you live in...what you are. This is the end of it, Sam. I'm gonna build something of me here that I can be proud to give to you.
Don't. I don't want it.
Do whatever you want with it. I don't care. All I want from you is for you to remember we built this house together.
We haven't build shit. You're just tearing down your father.
We haven't build shit. You're just tearing down your father.
Try it. It feels good.
Hi, Alyssa.
Hi, Mom.
I took some of your Vicodin.
I know. Why?

What do you know about me?
When you started first grade and your mom went to work, it was so she could save for an apartment. But then she met Peter and skipped the idea of renting.
He's got nothing to do with me.
He's got nothing to do with me.
I couldn't imagine how I could compete with him for any part of you. So, I didn't. He wanted you to have his last name...I let him even take that.

He was a prick when I was six, and he's a prick today.
I wish you had told me then.
I'm telling you now.
I'm telling you now.
I gave up on you.

I'd be in Tahoe having fun if you had given up.

Don't be. And hide whatever that new drug is you have. I like it.
Are you talking?
I was just thinking about my mom. She wouldn't leave him. I remember one time she made us dinner wearing sunglasses. I mean it was dark outside and in. But we never talked about it.

I would have killed him.
I would have killed him.
Everything would have been better if you had. You'd have liked your grandmother. And there'd be a girl out there that'd have her mother. I remember reading about her in the paper. They couldn't find her father and her mother was dead. I still feel guilty about that.

I loved him too much.
After everything he did to you and your mom?

That's so weird...
Dale wants to know if we should run an outside outlet for Christmas lights with a switch inside?
Absolutely. Have him put it on a separate line. At Christmas, we'll pact it so full of lights, we'll make God wear sunglasses.
You look better than ever.
I don't think Mom cares that much that my...that Peter left.

She seemed upset.

What's wrong with your back?
I mean, do you need to have surgery on it or what? Because those pills you're taking are for a lot of pain. And you're going through them quick.
Are you taking them still?
Are you taking them still?
No, but I count them. In a sock isn't new, you know?
I don't know what that means. What kind of problem?
The kind where there isn't really an answer.

I still don't know what that means.

We're all dying from the start. I just got picked for Advanced Placement.
You lied to me!
You lied to me!
I would have lied to me if I thought I'd believe it.

Well, congratulations! You fucking pulled it off!
I don't wanna go, Sam.
Here.
I'd eat a lot of red meat.
Good for you.
What would you do?
I'd build a house.
What kind of house?
You know what mortise and tenon is?
No one's really said four months is all you have, have they?
Stage four pancreatic cancer. They haven't even pretended to offer treatment. You tell me, when would you start eating red meat?

Can you build a house in four months?

I can die trying.
Good for you.
I haven't been touched in years.
I'm sorry, I don't know what that was.
A handshake, or you know, someone pats you on your back through clothes. Doctors, people who have to touch you. But not by people who want to.

Isn't that weird? I mean, I dated a little bit after my divorce, for four or five years. Six years. I know when my son was younger...maybe when he was ten or eleven even, he'd run up and wrap his arms around me.
I aimed high.
We just weren't very much alike, I guess. I don't know. I liked your dad more than I liked you.
Was bankrupt and dead before I was twenty.
Left you this place.
Left you this place.
It was in my name so he wouldn't lose it. He stole it from everyone that deserved it by putting me on title.

Do you know what I'd give to have this! Forget how I got it! I can't afford dirt in this town. I live in Riverside, Goddammitt And you get to piss in the ocean.
Your kid was down around Diver's Cover again, smoking pot. I didn't write him up...told him I wouldn't tell you...
Thanks for telling me.
Thanks for telling me.
At least your father tried, George.
Ah! Oh....
I know there's an explanation.
Mr. Dokos called to complain that you and a boy are squatting illegally in the garage of your house.
Check the permits. It was built as a guesthouse. It's a legally rentable unit grandfathered when South Laguna was incorporated.
I'm surprised he hasn't left.
I haven't forced him to work. I only wet him down once. Why would he leave?
It's my day off. I thought I'd help with the plumbing.
I need you to do me a favor.
I need you to do me a favor.
God, you look like crap, George.
God, you look like crap, George.
I want you to find someone for me.
Why do you let your dog crap on his lawn, day after day?
I don't let him. He just loves to.
How many bedrooms will your house have?
Three.
I just wanted to know where Mom was?
Oh. Sorry.
Oh. Sorry.
It's okay.

She needs to be alone, I think.

She's a little sad, is all.

I don't even care if he ever comes back.
You should lock your doors.
Ring the bell before you try the door.
Did Sam call to tell you he wouldn't be over this weekend?
You let him pierce his nose?
Lock the door behind you.
Where is he?
Where is he?
Where he always is.
What are you doing?
He doesn't answer.
He never answers.
Why does he have a lock on his door?
Why does he have a lock on his door?
Because he put the lock on! Do you think I told him he could have a nose ring?! Why do you ask me everything you should ask him!? I don't know anything, anymore!
I called everyone, everywhere! You just vanished! You could be dead!
Thanks for waking me up. Picking me up. You're loud today.

No. I was going to let you do that.
No. I was going to let you do that.
He's not spending the summer in Tahoe.
I did say he could go.
Let's go.
George --
He's not spending the entire summer with another kid in Tahoe. If he leaves, I will follow him up there and I will drag him home by his nose ring. He can hate me. You can hate me. He can try to kill me while I sleep. You can call the police. You can call your husband or your attorney, but Sam is spending
We're fine. Turkey sandwiches.
Well, for later then.
It makes me sad.
What?

I used to live here.

Sam's favorite.
I was up on the roof this morning, tearing it down and it struck me as strong as anything ever has. That I'm happy today.
What have you been before today?
What have you been before today?
It was just that, maybe the way the sun struck the ocean, the sound of the waves. It was simple, whatever it was. Then I started thinking about the last time I felt this good. It's been a long time.

Do you remember?
Do you remember?
The only time I can think of for sure, I was holding onto Sam in the ocean, saving him from the waves.
You head was pressed against my chest. I could feel your heart racing. And I remember I kissed your hair.
We have it on video! Was that when? My parents were down for his sixth birthday! I remember that.
What is it?
I'm fine. Nothing. I'll drop by your lunch tomorrow.
It's not breakfast yet.

Oh...with his ear infection!
Oh...with his ear infection!
My tongue around the edge of his ear is what cured him.
Go in there and lick his attitude.
The antibiotics weren't working. It's what I believe, George.
I've been wrong a lot in my life.
Hindsight. It's like foresight without a future.
With your hands or your tongue?
You're not well.
I thought you'd be up with the sun.
My stupid back.
Do you need anything? I'll go to the pharmacy. I have some Demerol at home.
No, I'm...thanks. I took something.
Where's Sam?
He won't use my shower. I don't get it.
You brought your kids?
I kind of said that maybe they could do something. Help. I'm sorry. They really wanted to come. I really wanted to come and they wanted to be with me. I don't think they'll be too much trouble.

I'll find something that won't kill them.

Or wound. Let them keep their eyes and fingers.
Or wound. Let them keep their eyes and fingers.
You're a good mother.
Do you need help?
I think so.
It's been a while.
This was my very first slow dance.
Tell him how you made me fall in love with you.
I smiled at him.
I smiled at him.
Watch out for the smile, boys.
Let's see if you've gotten any better.
Oh, I'm worse. Much, much worse.
Maybe you shouldn't come everyday.
No. Why? I like to be with Sam.
No. Why? I like to be with Sam.
It's just that there's less that Adam and Ryan can do anymore. I'd hate to have them bored.
I know they're not much help, but they love coming here, George.
How much time do they get to spend with their dad?
How much time do they get to spend with their dad?
What is it with this? They wouldn't spend less time with Peter if they lived here! He has no time!
Do you know Alyssa thinks something is up with us? She's giving me crap about being away from Peter and now you're trying to do the same thing! What no one seems to realize is that Peter isn't there! He's not there! And when he is, he isn't! So, if you don't want me here, or you don't want my kids here, just tell
I'd rather you not be here.
I thought we were helping.
I can hire workers to help me.
Nothing is going on with us, is it?
Going on?
Going on?
When I picked you up from the train station...what you said.
When I picked you up from the train station...what you said.
What did I say?
What did I say?
That thing about I was the most, you know, beautiful person you had ever known. What was that?
That thing about I was the most, you know, beautiful person you had ever known. What was that?
That was the truth.
That was the truth.
You've never said that before.

I'll say a lot of things I've never said before. It's habit.
I'll say a lot of things I've never said before. It's habit.
It sounded like a pick-up line.
It sounded like a pick-up line.
I can't pick you up.
I'm married.
You bit my finger.
You bit my finger.
If I weren't married?
Let's not do this, okay?
I need to know.
I need to know.
You need to know what? Do I still love you?
Is your back still killing you?
I didn't think you'd come today.
I didn't think you'd come today.
I kept thinking about it, what you said... I hope you were trying to keep me away fro the sake of me.
I kept thinking about it, what you said... I hope you were trying to keep me away fro the sake of me.
No. Mostly me.
No. Mostly me.
Peter left me yesterday.
Peter left me yesterday.
Left you?
Left you?
No goodbye. No fuck you. No 'Are you in love with George?'
No goodbye. No fuck you. No 'Are you in love with George?'
What did he say?
What did he say?
'I'll be in the bedroom.'
Back. Neck. Back.
What?
I could die.
So could I.
Are you going to kiss me?
It's not my back that's killing me.
Don't move!
I'm an idiot to have you up there.
I better get the kids home.
Not a perfect day.
Been thinking?
No.
It'll take you like twenty, thirty minutes.
Does Alyssa know?
Does Alyssa know?
Nothing.
Nothing.
You got any weed?
You got any weed?
You got the money?
What's your deal with Alyssa?
Don't even...I'm there.
Don't even...I'm there.
I wasn't sure.
I wasn't sure.
She wouldn't even fucking go out with until she was sixteen. I mean, that's not even a rule, just her own thing. She like figures things out on her own and then that's it.
He already knows everything about what he can't do. You can tell him not to even look at you, if you want.
I'm thinking it's too weird now.
It's just a joke. A stupid joke.
I could use the money.
He said he heard hammering.
Who?
What are you talking about?
I'm sixteen years old. I'm underage. How could I possibly threaten you?
What the fuck?
Everything happens for a reason. That's what my dad said.
Everything happens for a reason. That's what my dad said.
Then you tell me, what just happened?
Then you tell me, what just happened?
The payoff.
I don't have a clue anymore. I wish you'd talk to him. He needs a man.
His father is a man.
His father is a man.
A man he respects.
We've eaten.
Is Lois still here? I'm starved.
Is Lois still here? I'm starved.
I'll make you something.
Do you think it's odd your kids don't hug you?
Should I?
Should I?
It would worry me.
If I let everything that should worry me, worry me, I'd be dead from worry.
What would you be if you asked Adam and Ryan to run in now and hug you?
What would you be if you asked Adam and Ryan to run in now and hug you?
I'd be you.
To shave your chest?
We should take a vacation.
The biggest waste of time since television.
Do you remember anything I've said that wasn't negative?
I'd love to drive through New England in the Fall.
Sooner than the Fall.
After the kids are back in school.
Lois will stay with them. Or we can pawn them off on your parents.
I'm helping George build his house.
What?
What?
I've been helping for the last few days. Weeks. Sam's working. I told you Sam was working. I mean, he really is.
I've been helping for the last few days. Weeks. Sam's working. I told you Sam was working. I mean, he really is.
Good. That was the plan. We couldn't stand him and George needed help.
I can't go right now.
You can't go because of Sam?
You can't go because of Sam?
We haven't been away together for three years. What difference does a few months make?

You can't go with me because of Sam?

Sam is working at something for the first time in his life. Once in a while he even talks to me. I want to be around for that.
Sam is working at something for the first time in his life. Once in a while he even talks to me. I want to be around for that.
So am I, Robin. I'm working at something, too. I'm even talking. Do you want to be around for it?
I was talking about our marriage.
I know.
That sounds pathetic, doesn't it?
What are you doing home?
What are you doing home?
I always felt I could never marry you without first showing you what a fabulous life you cloud live despite me.
You never really trusted me.
You live a fabulous life, Robin.
You live a fabulous life, Robin.
Despite you.
Despite you.
I never asked for more.

That's the problem.

Please don't leave me.
Where are the kids?
Sam took them to a movie.
Sam took them to a movie.
I'll be in the bedroom.
I hardly recognize you with a beard.
That was my plan...to be hardly recognizable to you as me.
That was my plan...to be hardly recognizable to you as me.
I feel in love with George again.
Thanks for talking about me behind my back...useful in court.
Are you wearing eye shadow?
No.
Take it off.
Do it now!
If I walk out the door, who's gonna be here tonight for the follow through?
You don't look like you.
Either do you.
I thought I might be able to help, but it looks like you have all you can handle.
Do you like red?
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
You got a dog?
You got a dog?
It's not ours. It's George's.
I've missed you guys.
Why?
Do you know anything about building a house?
No.
No.
I guess I could teach you some things.
I guess I could teach you some things.
Okay.
What are you doing in my room?
I didn't go in your room.
I didn't go in your room.
I locked the door! Get out! I locked the door! Get out!
There were no PG's. So I just gave them money to play games.
Can you stay for dinner?
Can you stay for dinner?
Depends on what I'd give up on.
The door was open.
I don't know what I'm doing.
I don't know what I'm doing.
I wouldn't let Adam or Ryan see you doing it.
You're sure about this?
Yeah.
Yeah.
You could keep it and rent it out?
You could keep it and rent it out?
This is what he wants.
This is what he wants.
I read the letter. You read the will. He wants you to keep it. To live in it some day.
I read the letter. You read the will. He wants you to keep it. To live in it some day.
Then maybe this isn't what he wants, but this what he was hoping for. Maybe it's what I want.
Run downstairs and give your dad a hug.
Why?
Why?
He'll be gone for his birthday.
Queer.
What did you say?
What did you say?
Dad said it first.
Why do we have to get up and eat with you this early?
I just thought it would be nice.
All day again?
Not all day. I'll be home after lunch.
Ryan, would you rather swim or work?
Can we really help build a house?
I brought a few of my own.
Someone stop her!
Adam, that's not true!
Yes, it is.
Yes, it is.
Would you stop being ridiculous? Your father wants Sam home as much as I do.
Nothing R, okay?
Enough for drinks, popcorn and candy!
Go tell your father we're eating.
Dad's home, already?
Dad's home, already?
In the bedroom.
They ain't men, Mae Rose. They're convicts. And nigger convicts to boot. Can you say nigger?
Nagger?

No, nigger.

She's doing just fine.

He's a big one.

It's a boy! Well, let's get a look at him.
Biscuit, when you're done with Jangle Leg, you think you could squeeze me in?
Thought you'd never ask. Biscuit needs some gravy.

I'm talking about a haircut.
I'm talking about a haircut.
Cost you a pair of nylons.
Don't take it so hard, Biscuit. She don't mean nothin' to him.
Hell with him. It ain't that.
These are free papers.
What am I gonna do out there, Ray? I can't go home to my mama like this. I'll get the strap for sure.
What am I gonna do out there, Ray? I can't go home to my mama like this. I'll get the strap for sure.
Come on, Biscuit, this is good news. Your mama's gonna break down in tears when you show up on her doorstep.
It's 1945. It's a different world now.
Not for me, it ain't.
Not for me, it ain't.
Well you can't stay here, Biscuit. This ain't no life for a man. Any one of these fellas would give their right arm to be in your shoes. I sure know I would.
We get the games on the radio sometimes.
We played down in Jackson yesterday. Heard a rumor you've got a boy up here who can hit the ball a ton.

Kid's getting out. I got him a pardon.

Yeah, but what about me and Ray? I didn't see our names on that pardon. You said you were gonna put in a good word for us.
Yeah, but what about me and Ray? I didn't see our names on that pardon. You said you were gonna put in a good word for us.
I did, Claude. I mentioned you. I mentioned you both. But the fact is, pardons don't come cheap. The kid can hit. What can you do?
Look, I am truly sorry about this. I'd like to help you...
But you can't.
But you can't.
At least the kid's getting out. Isn't this what you wanted?
Oh, no, Ray. Not tonight. Spanky's not happy with you.

Nice girl like you don't belong in a place like this. But if you talk to Sylvia, tell her old Claude said congratulations.
Damn dentures slipping again. Everything falls apart when you grow old, eh, Claude? Time sure marches on.
Yes, boss.
Yes, boss.
You know, I'm fixing on retiring at the end of the summer, gonna try to enjoy what few years I have left. What do you think of this place? It's one of those new retirement communities down on the Gulf.
I apologize, Claude. That was rude of me.
That's alright, boss. Takes a lot more than a colorful brochure to hurt my feelings.
That's alright, boss. Takes a lot more than a colorful brochure to hurt my feelings.
You been on the farm for quite a spell, haven't you?
You been on the farm for quite a spell, haven't you?
Over forty years now. Me and Ray Gibson out there.
Forty years. That's a long time for any crime, even murder.
It's a hell of a lot longer when you're innocent.

Half the men in this prison swear they're innocent. Don't you think that's kinda funny?
Half the men in this prison swear they're innocent. Don't you think that's kinda funny?
You have to forgive me if I don't laugh.
You know I trust you, Claude.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
I'll be right back.
Goodnight, Mr. Wilkins. Mr. Pike.
Goodnight, Claude.
Cool it, Ray. You're gonna get us in a lot of trouble.
He's right, Gibson. Put down the gun and we'll work this out.
Claude, mind helping me to the bathroom?
Sure, boss.
Sure, boss.
I'm not your boss. Not anymore.
I got it... boss.
He don't sound like he's from 'round here.
I don't see no wedding ring, Banks. Conjugal visits are for married prisoners only.
You think you could make an exception just this once, boss? She came all the way down from New York.

I don't need the Baptists on my back, but I suppose I could issue a temporary marriage license for a nominal fee.
Craddock!... Williams... Henshaw!... Banks!
Here!
Comfortable?
As a pair of fur-lined bedroom slippers, boss.
As a pair of fur-lined bedroom slippers, boss.
We'll see what those slippers feel like after, say, 24 hours. And if you step down off them bottles -- if one toe so much as touches the dirt -- one of these boys is gonna shoot you dead. Let's see. We need a special man for this job.
For the kind of money they charge here, you'd think they could hire somebody to actually wash the dishes.
Claude. Here's to your new job down at the bank. I always knew you'd make something of yourself.
Claude. Here's to your new job down at the bank. I always knew you'd make something of yourself.
Know what I'm going to buy with my first pay check?
Season tickets to the Yankees. Right there on the first base line. What's wrong, baby?
I was hoping you were gonna say an engagement ring, Claude.
Engagement ring!
That's what respectable folks do. Get a job, get married, start having babies. That's what you want, isn't it?
That's what respectable folks do. Get a job, get married, start having babies. That's what you want, isn't it?
Sure it is. I just don't see any reason to rush into things. Damn, look at this shirt. I'll be right back.
Come on, honey, let's get out of here.
But I'm having a good time...
Did you go see my cousin Maynard like I asked you in my letter?
Of course I did. He said he'd file an appeal right away. You didn't tell me he was so good looking.
Of course I did. He said he'd file an appeal right away. You didn't tell me he was so good looking.
Yeah, that side of the family has all the looks and none of the brains. I hope he don't mess things up.
Yeah, that side of the family has all the looks and none of the brains. I hope he don't mess things up.
He seemed like a pretty good lawyer to me. His offices take up an entire floor of that big, new building on 125th Street, and he was using all these words I never heard before. He even offered me a job.

A job, huh? Well, that's nice, real nice. You won't have to work long. I'll be back soon enough. After I start work at First Federal Bank of Manhattan, I'll be keeping you in style. Everything will get back to normal again. That's a promise.
Listen, Claude, Maynard wanted to know if he should file the appeal on behalf of your friend, too.
Ray Gibson? No, no. He's the reason I'm in here, Daisy. For all I know, he's got a record a mile long. I got a better shot of getting out of here on my own. You tell Maynard to think about me, concentrate on me. Understand?
Ray Gibson? No, no. He's the reason I'm in here, Daisy. For all I know, he's got a record a mile long. I got a better shot of getting out of here on my own. You tell Maynard to think about me, concentrate on me. Understand?
Sure, Claude, whatever you say.
I've never seen you in here before.
That's because I've never been here before.

A thumb? What do you mean, like cut it off? For ten bucks? That include the tip?
Come on, daddy-o. You haven't said a word since we started. Least you could do is make some friendly conversation.
Look, man, I don't want friendly conversation. I don't want to be your friend. I've seen your friends and I don't like them. I just want to do this thing and get back to New York in time to start my job.

I must have left my appetite outside, which is where I think we ought to be right now.
You mean this sign? The one that says "No Coloreds Allowed." That's a good question. Ray, how come we missed the sign?
Look, ma'am, we've been driving all day. We'd just like to purchase one of those pies and we'll be on our way.
Thanks for backing me up here, Uncle Claude.
Don't Uncle Claude me. You get a load of those crackers? Couldn't be a mouthful of teeth among the bunch of 'em. Why you want to pick a fight with people like that for?

You're soft.
You're soft.
What'd you say?
I said you're soft.
Hey, man, don't ever call me that.
Hey, man, don't ever call me that.
I call it like I see it, and what I see is definitely soft.
Alright. You want some pie?
Yeah, I want some pie.
Yeah, I want some pie.
Okay then, I'm gonna walk over to that counter and get us some fucking pie.
Nice meeting you? You've been here before, haven't you?
What gave you that idea?
What gave you that idea?
Oh, I don't know, maybe because our lives depend on it, I just sort of thought you knew what you were doing!

What are you complaining about? It worked out. Everything's cool. Now, come on, let's head down there and see what's shaking. We deserve a little reward.

Reward?
Reward?
There are people down there having fun. I want to be one of them. I want you to be one of them. On Monday you can be a bank teller if you want, but tonight you're a bootlegger with a truck full of Puerto Rican rum and a fistful of cash.
Hey, Ray. I've been looking for you.
Here I am.
Here I am.
Guess we better get going, huh?

Fuck that cheap-ass watch -- I mean, how the hell are we gonna get home without any money?

We've still got 36 cases of rum. That's better than money.
I think he's hurt pretty bad.
He's dead.
He's dead.
Oh, man, I've never seen a dead body before!
What do you think you're doing?! The man's been dead for two seconds! Don't you have any respect?
It ain't here.
It ain't here.
What ain't there?
What ain't there?
My daddy's watch. This is the dude I was telling you about --
Yeah, nobody puts 'em away like old what's-his-name.
Winston. His name's Winston.
Winston. His name's Winston.
Come on, Ray, better get Winston back to the truck.
Would you look at that, Ray. Winston up and died on us.
Hell with him then. If he can't share the driving, he can't ride in the truck.
Man, this is gonna delay everything. Spanky's gonna be pissed.
Spanky's gonna be pissed? Poor Spanky. Fuck Spanky! What the hell kind of a name is Spanky, anyway? You're responsible for this situation. I blame you for everything. If it wasn't for you, I'd be home having a hot meal right now.
Spanky's gonna be pissed? Poor Spanky. Fuck Spanky! What the hell kind of a name is Spanky, anyway? You're responsible for this situation. I blame you for everything. If it wasn't for you, I'd be home having a hot meal right now.
If it wasn't for me, you'd be washing up on the beach at Coney Island right now. "I need all my thumbs and fingers for praying and doing good."
Life?! How long is life? We were just walking back to the truck. We didn't do nothing! Fuck life!
Life?! What's life mean? There's no way I can do life. I got a job starts Monday morning!
I wouldn't do that if I was you.
Shut up. It's too damn hot. What do you know, anyway?
Why do you think they call him Jangle Leg?
Somebody just told me he wins the three-legged race every year.
Somebody just told me he wins the three-legged race every year.
So?
So?
He does it all by himself.
This fork is filthy.
The fork is the least of your worries, Claude.
What a second, you've been in here since you were thirteen?
What about you, Radio?
I kinda lost track of how many people we killed that night. Must have been 15 or twenty -- not counting women and children. It was a real bloodbath. All that screaming...
Pack of lies. Don't listen to him. We didn't kill nobody. We were railroaded. And we gonna prove that.
Pack of lies. Don't listen to him. We didn't kill nobody. We were railroaded. And we gonna prove that.
He just blocked it out. Nigger's crazy. He's the one who did all the stabbing. He's capable of some heinous shit. How 'bout him down there?
No, man. I want you to have it.
Wait up there, Claude. You give that guy your corn bread and the next thing you know you'll be ironing his shirts and clipping his toenails.
Cookie drew me a map to Greenville.
So?
So?
You know what I'm saying.
You know what I'm saying.
Yeah, I know what your saying. And I'm saying if you made it that far, they'd be watching every train that pulls out of that station.
Yeah, I know what your saying. And I'm saying if you made it that far, they'd be watching every train that pulls out of that station.
That's why we won't take the train. Cookie showed me where there's a farm house. They got a boat there.
That's why we won't take the train. Cookie showed me where there's a farm house. They got a boat there.
What do you know about boats? I bet you can't even swim.
What I know about boats is they take you to freedom. Come on, man. I think we can do this.
Why are you always talking about we? There is no we. There is a me, there is a you. But there is no we between us.
You want out of this place, don't you? Don't tell me you're starting to like it here.
No, I don't like it here. Look around. There's nothing but ass. Male ass! Balls and ass! Believe you me, I'm getting out of here.
No, I don't like it here. Look around. There's nothing but ass. Male ass! Balls and ass! Believe you me, I'm getting out of here.
What does that mean?
What does that mean?
Forget it.
Forget it.
I'm not gonna forget it. What does that mean? If you've got a plan, I think I have a right to know about it. I told you my plan.
I'm not gonna forget it. What does that mean? If you've got a plan, I think I have a right to know about it. I told you my plan.
Getting a map from a chubby chef named Cookie? Dragging our asses through the swamps in search of some worm-eaten boat? That ain't a plan, that's a vacation for two in the hole. When you've got a map to New York City, you get back to me.
Maynard Banks, Esquire. Attorney at law.
Gimme that. That doesn't concern you.

The appeal was denied. Then Daisy went and fell for Maynard. They're engaged to be married, can you believe that?
The appeal was denied. Then Daisy went and fell for Maynard. They're engaged to be married, can you believe that?
Well, let's just think about that for a moment. He's a successful lawyer up in New York City and you're down here with a bright future in the cotton picking business. Eeny, meeny, miney, Maynard.

Come on, man. Don't shut me out. I'm telling you, you and me, that map, we can go places.
Come on, man. Don't shut me out. I'm telling you, you and me, that map, we can go places.
You know what, Claude? This whole time we've been down here, you've done nothing but think about yourself, acting like this whole thing is my fault. That plan with your cousin, did that include me?
No.
At least you're honest for once. So now you want to be my friend? Well, let me tell you something, Claude-my- shit-don't-stink-Banks. You got a lot to learn about friendship.

Does that mean I'm in?
Does that mean I'm in?
I don't think so, Claude. You'd just slow me down. We'd have to stop every five minutes so you could polish your silverware. There's no way around it, you're soft.

I said you're soft.
I said you're soft.
Don't call me that. You know I hate it when you call me that.
You did it, man! You got us out! Next stop, New York City!
New York's a long way's off. Let's just keep moving, okay?
I know these trees all look the same, but I'm getting an awful familiar vibration from this one right here. You sure you know where we're going?
Absolutely. The map is very clear.
Absolutely. The map is very clear.
Let me take a look at that map.
You call this a map? What was Cookie smoking when he drew this?
Cookie didn't draw it. I did.
Cookie didn't draw it. I did.
You drew this?!
You drew this?!
I knew you wouldn't come if I didn't have a map.
I knew you wouldn't come if I didn't have a map.
That gripes my soul, man. We're out here in the middle of nowhere. There is shit nibbling at my balls! Don't tell me you don't know where we're going!
Come on, Ray, time to go!
I'm stuck!
Don't mention it.
Hell, you'd probably be half way to New York by now...
Hell, you'd probably be half way to New York by now...
I'm serious, man. Don't mention it. Ever.
Keep it together, Claude. You wake up the man, he'll shoot you for sure.
He'd be doing me a favor. I'm getting outta here one way or the other! Goddamn rats and shit! Fuck!
All right, man, just settle down. We'll get outta here, Claude. We'll get outta here real soon.
How the fuck are we gonna do that, Ray?!
We'll just get off at the next stop.
Say what?
Say what?
That's right, we'll get off at the next stop. The train's pulling into the station right now.
That's right, we'll get off at the next stop. The train's pulling into the station right now.
The hell you talking about? What train?

We're in the Bronx, my man. Hundred and Sixty First Street.
Hundred and Sixty First Street? That's Yankee Stadium.
Hell, yes, Yankee Stadium. Bombers are playing a double-header against the Red Sox.

Allie Reynolds. He's my boy.

Of course, he's in the lineup. There he goes right there. Hey, Babe...!
What you're dealing with here is a complete lack of talent.
I'm sick of watching Camp 12 win the championship. Every year they get to roast the victory pig and we get dick. This year I want that pig.
You want to hit? Yo, Claude. Give Can't Get Right a shot.
Him?
Him?
Can't be worse than any of these other fools.
Can't be worse than any of these other fools.
All right, grab the bat. Let's see what you can do.
Judge must have money riding on the championship.
Don't matter who Camp 12 puts on the mound. All I know is when this season's over Camp 8's gonna have pork chops.
It's amazing what Ray here can do with a couple of pounds of potato skins and some molasses.
So, Blocker, what do you think of our boy?
What about us? Don't forget to mention us.
We're like his handlers. He can't function without us.
God may have given it, but Claude Banks spotted it and nurtured it.
Damn straight. I expect those Pittsburgh Crawdads to remember that.
Damn straight. I expect those Pittsburgh Crawdads to remember that.
Crawfords.
Crawfords.
Whatever.
It's a pardon from the governor.
Let me see that.
Let it go, Claude.
I'm not gonna let it go. The man needs to explain himself. Makin' promises.
You show them Crawfords how to play ball.
Make 'em throw strikes.
One of the new kids said they're farming those acres just north of the swamp. He said he saw a crop duster flying around the place.
I'm not in the mood right now, Ray.
I'm not in the mood right now, Ray.
He said they keep it parked out behind the barn. Can't be that hard to fly a plane. Lots of people do it.

They're called pilots! I'm serious, Ray. I'm not in the mood for one of your stupid, fucked-up plans right now.

I don't see you coming up with any plans.
I don't see you coming up with any plans.
My plan is on his way to Pittsburgh right now. That congenital idiot just got himself a pardon signed by the governor thanks to us, but we can't seem to do nothing for ourselves. Don't you feel a little disgusted right now?

Crop duster.
Crop duster.
I ain't getting in no airplane with you. I'm finally wrapping my mind around the concept. They threw us in this shithole for life. Don't you get it, Ray? We're gonna die here! Might as well head up to the cemetery, pick a plot and start digging.
My daddy died in prison. He gave up hope and hung himself. What you're talking about is the same damn thing. That ain't how I'm going.
Maybe you're fooling yourself, Ray. Maybe you're just a chip off the old block.
Maybe you're fooling yourself, Ray. Maybe you're just a chip off the old block.
Take that back or we ain't friends no more, Claude Banks.
Take that back or we ain't friends no more, Claude Banks.
Here's a news flash, Ray. We never were friends. We've just been stuck together for 12 years. It's been nothing but bad luck since the moment I ran into you. Every time I look at you I get sick to my stomach thinking about what my life could have been if I'd never bumped into Ray Gibson.
Better watch yourself Claude, before you say something you regret.
The only thing I regret is the day I met you.
The only thing I regret is the day I met you.
Well, if that's the way it is...
Well, if that's the way it is...
That's the way it is.
That's the way it is.
Then I have nothing left to say to you.
You're a sucker. I'd have taken that deal.
Excuse me? Are you talking to me?
Excuse me? Are you talking to me?
I'd have knocked you off those bottles, put a bullet in your ass and be half way to New York right now.

I hope you don't think I owe you anything. Because I don't owe you a damn thing.
I hope you don't think I owe you anything. Because I don't owe you a damn thing.
I didn't do if for you, anyway. I just ain't no boot-licking trusty, that's all.

That was five years ago.
That was five years ago.
I know, but since we're talking, I thought I'd mention it.
I know, but since we're talking, I thought I'd mention it.
We're not talking, you're talking, and doing too damn much of it, if you ask me.
What?!
You sure looked funny running for those pies, bullets flying all around you.
You sure looked funny running for those pies, bullets flying all around you.
Bullets weren't the problem. That pie was too hot. Burned my tongue.
You and Wilkins sure are getting chummy. You two planning on going steady, or something?
He's just a lonely old man. He likes to talk.
He's just a lonely old man. He likes to talk.
Hey, I'm a lonely old man. I like to talk, too. So why don't we start by talking about what kind of a plan you're working on?

You can't fool me, Claude. I know you got something brewing.
You can't fool me, Claude. I know you got something brewing.
Goodnight, Ray.
What the hell are you doing?
Don't touch that car.
Wilkins' driver's got the flu, so he asked me to fill in for him.
You haven't driven in 40 years, you ain't even got a license. Man's taking his life in his hands, putting you behind the wheel! Where you taking him?
You haven't driven in 40 years, you ain't even got a license. Man's taking his life in his hands, putting you behind the wheel! Where you taking him?
Greenville. We're picking up the new Superintendent at the bus station.
Damn, it was getting hot in there.
What the hell are you doing in that trunk?!
What the hell are you doing in that trunk?!
You didn't think I was gonna let you escape alone, did you?
You didn't think I was gonna let you escape alone, did you?
I ain't escaping! We're picking up the new super just like I told you.
I ain't escaping! We're picking up the new super just like I told you.

Come on, man, I'm starting to cramp up here. We have the chance right here, right now, I say we go!
Go where, Ray?
Go where, Ray?
Back to New York for starters.
Back to New York for starters.
And what will we do when we get there? I'm sixty-five years old, Ray. So are you. What are we gonna do out here? Get married, have kids, settle down? That boat sailed without us, man.
And what will we do when we get there? I'm sixty-five years old, Ray. So are you. What are we gonna do out here? Get married, have kids, settle down? That boat sailed without us, man.

Some faces you just don't forget. Warren Pike's is one of 'em.
I don't like it, I don't like it one bit. We shoulda taken that car when we had the opportunity. We'd be half way to New York by now.
I don't like it, I don't like it one bit. We shoulda taken that car when we had the opportunity. We'd be half way to New York by now.
We'd be in the hole by now. Hey, man, you're peeing on my shoe.
We'd be in the hole by now. Hey, man, you're peeing on my shoe.
I know. Simultaneously, they shake and zip. Claude bends down and picks up a bowl of gumbo, placing it on a tray next to an identical one.
Don't shoot, sir. I can deal with this. Ray, buddy, you don't want to shoot this white man. See, you do that, they'll kill you for sure. And it's not that I like you or anything, but I've kinda gotten used to having you around.
He's got my daddy's watch, Claude. I always knew whoever took that watch killed Winston Hancock. And that was you, Mr. Pike.
No, I'm gonna kill him --
No, believe me, I'm gonna kill him!
I can't do it.
That's because you're soft. Gimme the gun.
That's because you're soft. Gimme the gun.
What'd you say?
What'd you say?
I said you're soft.
I said you're soft.
Don't call me soft, I hate it when you call me that.
Why don't he just tell 'em the truth?
He knows nobody wants to hear the truth.
Nurse Humphries was checking my prostate this morning. I got an erection.
An erection, huh? Haven't had one of those in a while.
An erection, huh? Haven't had one of those in a while.
Tell me about it. Scared me at first. Then, before I could figure out what to do with it, it was gone. Imagine my disappointment.
Sure would like to see the house that Ruth built one more time.
Well, Ruth shoulda built it a little better. Damn thing's falling to pieces. Gonna hurt somebody.
Well, Ruth shoulda built it a little better. Damn thing's falling to pieces. Gonna hurt somebody.
What do you expect? It's almost as old as we are.

They oughta tear that shit down and ship them Yankees cross the river to Jersey.
Remember what that place looked like on a sunny spring day? More beautiful than any church I was ever in.
Over to the morgue and up the hill to the cemetery. Never thought I'd admit it, Claude, but you were right.
'Course I was right. About what?
'Course I was right. About what?
You're the one who said that boneyard's the only way we're getting out of here. We're gonna join all the rest of 'em soon enough. Jangle Leg, Biscuit, Goldmouth, Poker Face, Cookie, Radio -- yes sir, pick a plot and start digging...
Are you trying to tell me after all this time you finally have a plan for busting out of here?
Shh! Is that so hard to believe?
Shh! Is that so hard to believe?
Don't tell me, I don't want to hear it. It's probably all fucked up, anyway.
Don't tell me, I don't want to hear it. It's probably all fucked up, anyway.
You don't want to hear it, you don't want to hear it. There's no shame in that.
You don't want to hear it, you don't want to hear it. There's no shame in that.
It's too late for plans.
It's too late for plans.
Never thought I'd hear Ray Gibson say that. Hell with you then. You'd only slow me down anyway.
I can't eat this.
Why the hell not?
Why the hell not?
I saw that hot dog guy in the bathroom urinating. He didn't wash his hands.
Just put some mustard on it and eat it.
You didn't get ketchup?
You didn't get ketchup?
Gimme that damn thing.
Hell of a day for a ballgame, huh, Claude?
Hell of a day, Ray. Yankees are on fire.
No, this ain't gonna work either. It's half chocolate, half vanilla.
So?
So?
They're touching.

Yeah? You and what army?

Damn, I shoulda let Spanky Johnson drown you in the river when I had the chance.
I know you're not talking to me...
I'm sorry, he's on medication...
How you doin'?
I'm all right.
I'm all right.
You ever done time before?

'Preciate it. Claude.
Soft and supple. Like a lady's.
I try to moisturize regularly.
What is that?
Creamed chip beef on toast. Except we're outta beef, so I had to improvise.

Can't I get one of those steaks you got grilling back there?

Those are for trusties, unless you got thirty cents or two packs of cigs.
At least he didn't kill Santa Claus with his bare hands.
You killed Santa Claus?
Alright, well, let's say you make it to Greenville. What's there, anyway?
Grandma Dodi's Pork Rib Joint.
You got your own nightclub?
Well, not yet. It's still in the planning stages.
Ray, my man, this steak is like butter!
Made just for you, Cookie.
Made just for you, Cookie.
How about some steak sauce?
How about some steak sauce?
No problem. Oh, boy!
Why ain't his pick swinging?
Why ain't that pick swinging?
Too hot, huh? Well, you tell that lazy jiggaboo the state of Mississippi ain't interested in his meteorological assessments.
Listen up, jiggaboo! State of Mississippi ain't interested in your... in your... metropolitan assets!
Listen up, jiggaboo! State of Mississippi ain't interested in your... in your... metropolitan assets!
Tell him the state of Mississippi is only interested in getting this ditch cleared by sundown.
Tell him the state of Mississippi is only interested in getting this ditch cleared by sundown.
State of Mississippi wants this ditch cleared by sundown. You got that?!
He's from New York City. That one, too.
New York. That's up north, ain't it? They'll find we do things different down here.
Looks like we got a couple of live ones. How long these boys in for?
Judge gave 'em the long ride.
Judge gave 'em the long ride.
Life, huh? They step outta line again, we'll shorten up that sentence real fast.
We lost yesterday on accounta the rain. That means we gotta make up for it today, so put your backs to it.
You heard the boss! Let's move!
All in, boss!
Move it out.
Move it out.
Movin' it out, boss.
We don't need no fences at Camp 8, boss.
That's right. We don't need no fences, we have the gun line. It runs from shack to shack clear around the yard. You are now inside the gun line...
Alright, listen up! I want every man lined up out here in the yard on the double! Let's move it!
You heard what the man said! Move it!
Maybe I oughta eat your corn bread.
My corn bread? Oh no, my friend. I love corn bread.
So it don't exist.
Just because it's in my mind, Goldmouth, don't mean it ain't real. Everything worth anything starts with a dream.
You mean Louis Armstrong?
He's a good friend of mine. Drops by the club whenever he's in town.
That's right, fellas. Catch any cab heading uptown. All the drivers know Ray's Boom-Boom Room.
Hey, Ray...
Where am I at, man?
C'mon, Goldmouth, somebody's gotta watch the front door.
Hey, the dude's holdin'.
Come on, old-timer, hook the brothers up.
Hell of a way to get out. Heard they burned up in that fire yesterday.
I seen the bodies before they sealed 'em up. Them fellas sizzled up good. Looked like some shit from the X- Files. Damn, that shit's nasty.
So Ray and Claude got their pardons, right?
No, they didn't get their pardons, you dumb shit! If they'd got their pardons way back then, we wouldn't be burying them today, would we?
No, they didn't get their pardons, you dumb shit! If they'd got their pardons way back then, we wouldn't be burying them today, would we?
Oh, right. Well, why didn't they get those pardons?
That musta messed 'em up pretty bad.
What happened to 'em after that, Willie?
Man, you really bummed me out. That's a terrible story. Nigger, you crying?
Hell, no! I just got something in my eye.
What do you think about that?
I think that old man lost his marbles about a hundred years ago. Come on, let's get this over with.
Why do I get the feeling when you say some time, you mean some time.
I was already here a good many years when they came in in 1932.
I was already here a good many years when they came in in 1932.
1932? That's like, that's like...
1932? That's like, that's like...
Sixty-five years ago. They always said the farm couldn't hold 'em forever. Looks like you're finally free, boys.
Ray's special recipe. He always had exacting standards where the hooch was concerned.
What were they, bootleggers?
Old man Wilkins' never came out of that bathroom. Died right there on the crapper.
Just like Elvis.
Just like Elvis.
Of course nobody believed Ray and Claude.
It's alright for a man to cry once in awhile. Just don't make a habit of it.
Hey, Willie, what was Claude's plan, anyway?
Hey, Willie, what was Claude's plan, anyway?
Nothing to it, really. Claude figured they could steal a couple of bodies from the morgue. They got a couple of crackers working there don't know their asses from their elbows. Then they was gonna set fire to the infirmary and make it look like those bodies was them that got stuck inside. Claude figured during the commotion, it wouldn't be too hard to
Mama?
Rayford!
What are you doing here, mama?
I heard some things so I went to see Spanky Johnson. He told me what happened and gave me some money to get down here. What happened to your face?
I heard some things so I went to see Spanky Johnson. He told me what happened and gave me some money to get down here. What happened to your face?
Don't worry about that. Hey, fellas, this here is my mama. These are some of my friends. That's Willie, there's Poker Face, Radio, Cookie, Goldmouth, Biscuit, Jangle Leg.
Rayford, I wanted so much more for you than this.
Don't cry, mama. This place ain't so bad as it looks. Sure, we work hard, but there's plenty fresh air and sunshine... And you know something else, I've taken to going to church regular. They got services every Sunday right there in the mess hall.
Don't cry, mama. This place ain't so bad as it looks. Sure, we work hard, but there's plenty fresh air and sunshine... And you know something else, I've taken to going to church regular. They got services every Sunday right there in the mess hall.
Don't you lie to me, Rayford. You still have your daddy's watch? Well, this is all I can give you. I wish it was more.
I can't take that, mama.
Don't argue with me. You need it more than I do. I know how a little money can help in a place like this.
I can't believe this. I always said I'd never end up like this. I thought I'd make something of myself, do something with my life. You know, be successful. Have a big house, a family. Now I'm gonna end up just like daddy.
Don't say that, Rayford. Don't ever say that. He gave up hope. That's where you gotta be different.
Don't say that, Rayford. Don't ever say that. He gave up hope. That's where you gotta be different.
They gave me life, mama.
They gave me life, mama.
I gave you life. And they can't take it away from you. Remember that. You'll get outta here someday. I believe that. You gotta believe it, too.
Is everyone here?
Hey, where's Claude? I don't see Claude!
Hey, where's Claude? I don't see Claude!
Stay calm, Ray. We'll find him. Claude! Has anyone seen Claude?
Stay calm, Ray. We'll find him. Claude! Has anyone seen Claude?
He must still be in there.
Wait for the firemen!
It'll be too late.
It'll be too late.
You can't go in there, Ray! You'll never make it!
You can't go in there, Ray! You'll never make it!
I'm going in for him. He'd do the same for me.
Lemonade?
I prefer bourbon.
I prefer bourbon.
I'm sorry, I don't keep any liquor in the house.
I'm sorry, I don't keep any liquor in the house.
Well, fortunately, I carry my own.
Hunting's been pretty good on the farm the last few years. It's one of the perks of the job. If you're interested, tomorrow I could show you some of my favorite spots.
You don't have to twist my arm. Say now, that gumbo has quite a kick.
You don't have to twist my arm. Say now, that gumbo has quite a kick.
Thank you, Claude. That'll be all for tonight.
If you don't mind my saying, you seem mighty familiar with your house boy.
I believe in treating the convicts with respect, if that's what you mean.
I believe in treating the convicts with respect, if that's what you mean.
Respect? Well, isn't that progressive.
Respect? Well, isn't that progressive.
If somebody deserves respect, Mr. Pike, they receive it from me, convict or no convict.
What's going on here?
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to teach this uppity nigger a lesson in manners.
He's crazy. Don't listen to him, Wilkins.
Do you realize what your saying, Gibson?
Is there any truth to what he's saying, Pike?
What difference does it make? Natchez was better off without Winston Hancock! Who cares if a couple of no- account bootleggers went to jail for his killing? At least the state of Mississippi got 40 years of cheap labor out of the deal!
Besides, why bother with bootlegging when we got us a clear cut case of murder?
Excuse me, sheriff. As we explained to your associate here, there's been a mistake. We didn't kill anybody. Now, as for the bootlegging, we happen to work for a very important man in New York.
Mr. Johnson is very well connected. If you were to let us go, I guarantee he would show you his appreciation, if you know what I mean.
Are you offering me a bribe?
Are you offering me a bribe?
I'm just trying to pay the toll on the road to justice.
I'm just trying to pay the toll on the road to justice.
You may be able to buy your way out of trouble up in New York City, but down here we take murder seriously.
Yeah, it's getting late. I could sure use a bath.
That's a real nice watch you got there, sir. Fancy old thing even plays a little tune.
That's a real nice watch you got there, sir. Fancy old thing even plays a little tune.
Yeah, it's special. They don't make 'em like this anymore.
Yeah, it's special. They don't make 'em like this anymore.
Sure don't. Mind if I ask where you got it?
Sure don't. Mind if I ask where you got it?
Why, my wife gave it to me on our anniversary some years back.
Must have been some time ago. Maybe forty years?
Something like that, yes.
Something like that, yes.
She give you that scar, too?
I oughta shoot you for that comment, boy.
Like you shot Winston Hancock?
I'm gonna work this man's brains out the back of his head.
Shoot him, Wilkins!
That watch was the only thing my daddy ever gave me. It meant the world to me.
Goddamn it, Wilkins, would you please just shoot the nigger!
Goddamn it, Wilkins, would you please just shoot the nigger!
He shoots me, I swear I'll take you with me! I just want to hear you say it.
Apparently, your sister died.
Jenny?
Jenny?
No, it says Marleen here.
Appreciate it.
Anybody else need anything read?
Hey, Ray, Goldmouth don't believe me. Ain't it so they got trains up in New York City that run under the streets?
They're called subways. A nickel will take you from one end of Manhattan to the other. Helluva ride, too.
Who?
Satchmo.
Couple years back, Cookie made it clear to Greenville.
Greenville, that the nearest town?
Hey, Ray, you ever been to the Cotton Club?
Sure I've been to the Cotton Club. It's pretty sweet. But it don't hold a candle to the Boom Boom Room. That's where the real action is.
Hey, Ray, what's the name of that nightclub of yours?
You mean the Boom-Boom Room?
You mean the Boom-Boom Room?
That's it. The Boom-Boom Room. Sure would like to see that place when you get it up and running.
That's it. The Boom-Boom Room. Sure would like to see that place when you get it up and running.
You should have come by last night, Radio. You woulda had yourself some fun.
What's your name?
Me? Willie Long.
Me? Willie Long.
What are you in for, Willie?
What are you in for, Willie?
That's a long story...
Goldmouth? They say he was born out back behind the shithouse. That's what they say.
You all been here a long time. Doesn't anybody ever escape from this place?
You all been here a long time. Doesn't anybody ever escape from this place?
They run but they never get too far.
What's the Boom Boom Room?
That's my joint. The swinginest nightclub in town.
Last night? What are you talking about, Ray?
I'm talking about old Satchmo nearly blew the roof off the joint.
Alright Willie, I think I got everything. I'll talk to Dillard, see if I can get up to the infirmary and check up on you. Make sure they're changing your diapers regular.
They'll be sending you up there soon enough. And not just for a visit, neither.
They'll be sending you up there soon enough. And not just for a visit, neither.
I slipped in a couple of bottles of my latest batch. Help wash down all them pills they'll be giving you.
How you doing? We're looking for Slim.
You found him.
Man, that music is hot. What goes on down there, Slim?
That's Natchez-under-the-Hill.
That's Natchez-under-the-Hill.
Blacks welcome there?

Green's the only color that matters under the hill. They got gambling, girls. You oughta check it out.
Green's the only color that matters under the hill. They got gambling, girls. You oughta check it out.
Maybe we will. Nice meeting you.
You don't have to drown that fella, Spanky. You already scared him half to death. He didn't know who he was fucking with.
But you do. What does that say about you, Ray? What does that say about me? I've given you a lot of leeway over the years on account of your father. But he didn't last long enough to teach you the meaning of the word respect so I guess I'm gonna have to school you myself.

Come on, Spank, I'm just trying to get by here. You remember how it was when you were starting out.
What's that, some of your bathtub brew?
Puerto Rican rum. See for yourself.
Where'd you get this?
Comes up the Mississippi. I can get more. A lot more. I was thinking about going into business for myself, but under the circumstances, I'd be willing to take on a partner.
I'm interested. Keep talking.
All I need is the front money and a truck. I could be back in two, three days tops if I had somebody to share the driving.
If you fuck me on this one, I'll spare no expense.
Understood.
Understood.
Alright, Ray, you've got a deal. Pick your man and get going.
I'll take the little choirboy, if you don't mind.
If I was you, I'd want somebody who can handle himself in a tight spot.
If I was you, I'd want somebody who can handle himself in a tight spot.
I just want somebody who won't put a bullet in my back once the truck is full.
ADRIAN!
You shouldn't have come here.
You shouldn't have come here.
Please, get out of my mind!
Adrian, you gotta come back to Hell. Dad's sick.
He's sick?
He's sick?
Yeah, he needs souls to live. When you guys left, you broke the gates. We gotta get the gates burning again before he dies.
He should have thought of that before he denied me my birthright.
Well maybe you should go back and talk it over with him.
Well maybe you should go back and talk it over with him.
How about this? I stay here enjoying my Schnapps and you go back.
Of course I can. Drink or she dies. Unlike you, she won't come back from where she's going.
Let her go.
Let her go.
I hear a train coming. Drink.
Welcome to the party. It's so nice to see all of you here.
Hey, that's Dad's throne! How did Adrian get that? Is Dad okay?
Little Nicky.
Adrian, I'm asking you nicely, in the name of all that is good: release my friends and get in the flask.
Adrian, I'm asking you nicely, in the name of all that is good: release my friends and get in the flask.
Is this a joke?
Is this a joke?
No. It's the inner light. And with it we can defeat anything you've got.
Now will you get in the flask?
Absolutely not.
I knew it. He's finally retiring.
I've been waiting on this day for ten thousand years.
You work your ass off for ten thousand years, hurting people, helping others hurt people, then you get a decision like that.
And he's dead serious.
And he's dead serious.
It's just such a slap in the face.
Um, excuse me, we're having a private conversation here.
Yeah, get out of here! Beat it!
That's what I thought!
Could you concentrate for five seconds?
Could you concentrate for five seconds?
I am concentrating. Where can we rule?
I am concentrating. Where can we rule?
What do you think about... Earth?
We could create our own hell there.
You saying we go up there and kill everyone?

Eventually, Cassius. But first we corrupt as many as we can so that when we do destroy them...
Eventually, Cassius. But first we corrupt as many as we can so that when we do destroy them...
...their damned souls will be ours.
...their damned souls will be ours.
It's our time, brother.
"Let the sin begins" -- that was a good one.
Well, we must get people sinning if we want to fill up our New Hell. How are things going down at City Hall?
Well, we must get people sinning if we want to fill up our New Hell. How are things going down at City Hall?
I lowered the drinking age to ten.
I lowered the drinking age to ten.
Brilliant. This is so much fun. I never want it to end.
Brilliant. This is so much fun. I never want it to end.
Why should it end? Who's gonna stop us?
Hello, Cassius.
All right. Let me out.
All right. Let me out.
You know, New Hell really only needs one new Satan.
You know, New Hell really only needs one new Satan.
You mother...
Thank you, Nicky. Cause now I'm gonna bust Adrian's head wide open.
I was going to let you out, eventually, Cassius. I swear.
No!
Don't do it!
Ta-da. So what time is my brother expected back?
Noon...
But what about the cash? Can we keep it or what?
Sure, why not?
It is awfully hot down here. How do you manage to stay so cool?
Weed lowers the body temperature. I read that... in, uh... er, science magazine.
And give you a good buzz.
Or maybe it will trap me inside for all eternity.
Or maybe it will trap me inside for all eternity.
Uh. No it won't?
Oh, Nicky, I've missed you. Come on out and say hello...
Urr... uggg... errr...
Urr... uggg... errr...
I'm calling you out, brother...
Keep it up and I just might make you my Queen for a night or two.
You want a queen? Got one right here.
Oh. My. God. I can't believe you're here. Welcome. Can I just tell you, I am so excited right now.
So excited.
I remember that night, you had like four daiquiris.
Try four and a half. At first I totally didn't like him.
I'll call her later.
You know, we saw you save your girlfriend's life.
All these good people have totally been led astray.
Show him Central Park.
She goes to Parson's, right?
I would totally love to go there. But I hear it's really hard to get in.
The home of eternal damnation, house of Hades, H.E. double toothpicks...
Maybe try the opposite of that.
Okay, can I just ask you something? What do you know about your mom?
My brothers told me my mother was a mountain goat. Which would explain my chronic halitosis.
My brothers told me my mother was a mountain goat. Which would explain my chronic halitosis.
A mountain goat? That's really sweet.
A mountain goat? That's really sweet.
My mom wasn't a goat?
My mom wasn't a goat?
Try an angel.
Try an angel.
An angel?
An angel?
Unh-huh. Which would make you half angel.
Wow. What... what did she look like?
Well, she was about six-three, only spoke Portuguese and had really long grey hair.
How come you're not older?
Angels don't get any older, son.
Where did you meet my father?
It was a long time ago, at some Heaven and Hell mixer.
Hello... yes, he's here with me now... I don't know if he's hot, he's my son, you perv! I'll call you back... Oh my God, I will call you back, goodbye. That was my friend, Michelle, she says "hi."
Well tell her I said "hi" back.
How did you see me?
We can see what's going on anywhere on Earth. Look.
Valerie's crying!
She's so nice.
I gotta help her. I gotta help Dad. I gotta help everybody.
Yeah, you do...
But how can I win? Adrian is stronger and smarter than me.
Stronger, yes. Smarter, definitely. But you have something he doesn't have.
Stronger, yes. Smarter, definitely. But you have something he doesn't have.
A speech impediment?
What is it?
I'm not a hundred percent on that. God said when the time comes, you'll know what to do.
Well, nice meeting you, Jenna, Christa. Would it be okay if I called you Mommy?
It would be so okay.
Well, Mommy, get me to the big apple cause I'm gonna rock that town like a hurricane.
You're already there...
What's Nicky doing down there?
Trying to capture his brother in a flask and preserve the balance of good and evil on Earth.
Did you just talk?
No.
Where is he? He's late.
He'll be here. Just keep your cool, kid.
They castrated him. He can't shoot arrows, he can't piss smoke.
I can't screw. I can't screw.
Oh my God, he just opened his mouth and swallowed that spit.
That turn you on there, RuPaul?
My name's Beefy. I'm an old friend of your father's. He's asked me to help you out.
I just need to find my brothers and be on my way, Beefy.
I just need to find my brothers and be on my way, Beefy.
It's not gonna be easy. Your brothers can possess people. So they probably won't look like themselves. You have to be suspicious of everyone.
Okay, "bro," this jig is up... Just get in the bottle. Just slide right on in there.
It's not me, moron.
It's not me, moron.
Oh. Sorry.
Makin' friends already.
It's freezing up here, Beefy.
It's freezing up here, Beefy.
You're on Earth now, kid. Gonna have the same physical needs and limitations a human has. We'll stop by K-mart. Get you some warm clothes.

I also have this odd pain in my mid section. Kind of a hollow feeling...

So far, so good. Now what?
Put it in your mouth.
Hey... Popeye's chicken is ass kickin'!
It sure is. Now eat it up. You're gonna need your energy.
It sure is. Now eat it up. You're gonna need your energy.
I got energy up the ying-ying. Let's get cracking!
From now on. I'm just going to avoid all moving metal objects.
Great. Now your father gave me some deposit money for a nice pad on the Upper East Side. But I misplaced it.
You'll be alright. Go on. Big day tomorrow. Don't forget to do that sleep thing I told you about.
Got ya. Is it okay if I do the sleep thing?
This is intense! And it happens every day? Sometimes twice? I gotta tip my hat to you people!
Look, it's okay for me to shit the street. But you gotta use a toilet.
Look, it's okay for me to shit the street. But you gotta use a toilet.
Okay, just point me in the right direction next time.

Come on, there's like ten million people in this city and the clock is ticking.
Well, let's rock and roll.
All that running and chasing is making the sleep thing want to come early.
I think we have to work on narrowing down our list of suspects. Now I'm going to go check in with some of my contacts uptown.
Your brothers are upsetting the balance of good and evil.
What can I do about it?
What can I do about it?
You can't do jack shit... unless you learn your evil powers.
You can't do jack shit... unless you learn your evil powers.
Nobody's as evil as my brothers. Those dudes put the wick in wicked.

But those are my roommate's sodas...
But those are my roommate's sodas...
"But those are my roommate's sodas..." Does that sound like a statement the son of the devil would make?
You have the power to change the cola in that can into any other liquid -- engine oil, bat's blood, moose piss. You just have to release the evil within you.
Release the evil?
Release the evil?
I'm just saying, there's wickedness in you... I can tell from your snores.
We had the greatest afternoon of my life until Adrian made me tell her she had a heart-shaped ass.
Maybe you love her. But what do I know? I'm baked out of my mind.
I seem to be in trouble, Beefy.
The shit has hit the fan, kid. Take a look.
I didn't murder anybody
Look. You were really high. Things happen.
Look. You were really high. Things happen.
I was with Valerie, I swear. This is Adrian's work. I've got to find him.
I was with Valerie, I swear. This is Adrian's work. I've got to find him.
I think you're looking at him.
This is baloney!
He superimposed your head onto "Scarface."
What's with all the whoo-whoo noises?
Everything's fine, pop.
Everything's fine, pop.

This is bullshit, man. I'm gonna win the Superbowl this year, with or without you!
Now you're talking.
Knock, knock.
Yes, Jimmy.
No, no, that's not what I said. He can keep his thumbs, but the fingers gotta go.
Oh, and don't forget, you're shoving a pineapple up Hitler's ass at four o'clock.
I got no ears! I can't hear!
Now he's got no ears! You happy, Nicky? Your father's got no ears!
Check one-two. Check one-two.
Put it back on my head. I'm falling apart here.
Put it back on my head. I'm falling apart here.
He's got 'til midnight tonight, Nicky. You get your ass back up there. You save your father!
Nothing, Dad. Just re-arranging the furniture.
Cassius, didn't I tell you to stay out of your brother's mind?
Now everybody sit down.
Hey, Dad, I'm almost finished laying down my monsters of metal compilation tape. I really think it's a masterpiece.
Hey, Dad, I'm almost finished laying down my monsters of metal compilation tape. I really think it's a masterpiece.
Okay, kid, we'll listen to it later.
This was a very difficult decision, because I have three wonderful sons. I mean, Adrian, so smart, so ruthless. And Cassius, so strong, so tough. And Nicky, so... so...
Don't worry about coming up with anything. It's cool.
Don't worry about coming up with anything. It's cool.
Such a sweet boy. But after much thought and careful consideration, I've decided that the ruler for the next ten thousand years is going to have to be... me.
I mean... tough break.
The important thing for the stability of our rule is to maintain the balance between good and evil. And I don't think any of you are ready for that responsibility yet. You need the wisdom that comes only with the passage of time.
Now that was an experience. "You are only coming through in waves." That line blows my mind every time.
Definitely.
Definitely.
I don't care what kind of mood you're in at the start of that song. When it's over, that mood has been altered. Wow. Great shit. What's next?
I don't care what kind of mood you're in at the start of that song. When it's over, that mood has been altered. Wow. Great shit. What's next?
Well, I thought that after messing with your head, I'd give you a little kick in the keester.
Who is this, Metal-lick-a?
Metallica, Dad. Come on.
Metallica, Dad. Come on.
I was just playing with you.
You're a good devil, Dad.
And I also happen to be a Jets fan.
This is bad, Nicky.
How bad?
How bad?
I'm gonna die, Nicky. If the gates are broken, no new souls can get in, which means I'll start to deteriorate into nothing.
To do that Cassius and Adrian have to come back through the other way.
So go get 'em, Dad!
So go get 'em, Dad!
I'm too weak. The process has already begun.
Nicky, the worst thing that could happen on Earth is you get killed, in which case, boom, you end up back here.
Are you telling me I have to go to Earth and kill my brothers?
No. This can't be happening.
Son, just do your best.
That's a train, son. Don't stand in front of them.
Well, I guess I'm going to have to take a mulligan on this one.
Well, I guess I'm going to have to take a mulligan on this one.
Please, Nicky, get back up there. Try to hurry.
Dad, Adrian's got the whole city after me. He's always a step ahead. What am I gonna do?
What are you gonna do? Look at me, Nicky! I got no legs, I got no hips, I got one ear...
Uh, I'll do my best, Dad. Do you have any advice at all for me?
I can't hear you, Nicky. I can't hear anything!
You came through, Nicky.
I came through for you, Mom and the butterflies, Dad.
I came through for you, Mom and the butterflies, Dad.
You're back in Hell now, kid. There's no butterflies here. If you want butterflies, you need to be on Earth.
You're back in Hell now, kid. There's no butterflies here. If you want butterflies, you need to be on Earth.
What about you and Grandpa and everyone in Hell?
What about you and Grandpa and everyone in Hell?
Nicky, I let my butterflies die once upon a time and it's never stopped hurting. That's right, you heard me, Holly. I'm still in love with you.
Listen, I got down low. Your mom's got up high. You take care of the middle.
I will, Dad. But in the words of Motley Crue, this will always be my... home sweet home...
I'm lucky to get away with just the head boobs, right?
Coulda been much worse.
Coulda been much worse.
That's what I'm thinkin'...
Hey.
That's a pretty brassiere.
That's a pretty brassiere.
Thanks.
Thanks.
Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
You got it. Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
You got it. Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
You got it.
Bus?
Beast.
You know, I was the one who created Hell.
I know, your wickedness.
I know, your wickedness.
I started slow, though. For years, I was just giving people hot foots. Actually, you can give all the credit for Hell to my first wife; she was the inspiration. She was an ugly one, too. One day, she asked me if I wanted super sex. I said I'll take the soup.
You know what was in Hell when I came down here, Cassius?
It's Stanley, sir.
It's Stanley, sir.
Nothing. No mountains. No castles. Looked like a giant parking lot. It wasn't even called Hell.
Nothing. No mountains. No castles. Looked like a giant parking lot. It wasn't even called Hell.

Boogerland!

That's nice, Grandpa. Why don't you just enjoy the fishing?
That's nice, Grandpa. Why don't you just enjoy the fishing?
I can't enjoy anything. I go fishing. I catch nothing. I go to orgies, I catch everything...
Hey...
Your father wants to see you and your brothers in the throne room.
Your father wants to see you and your brothers in the throne room.
Okay, but Jimmy, when the house is rockin', don't forget the knockin'!
Nothing's getting through that. The fire is solid as a rock.
We gotta get this bad boy burning again. Ideas?
So go get 'em, Jimmy!
I'm just a demon, Nicky. I don't got devil blood in me. I'd last two minutes up there with your brothers.
I'm just a demon, Nicky. I don't got devil blood in me. I'd last two minutes up there with your brothers.
You're not saying it's up to me?
I've never been to Earth. I've never even slept over at some other dude's house!
You're the spawn of Satan. You got it in you.
You were gone ten seconds. What happened?
I got hit by a big light that was attached to a lot of metal.
No wonder your uncle's so weird...
I gotta say this cake tastes a little funny.
I was in love one time but she said I wasn't financially reliable enough. And she needed that.
By she, do you mean he?
By she, do you mean he?
No.
Easy, Liberace.
Oh, would you grow up.
His name is Andrew. I know that guy.
Of course you do, Tommy Tune.
Sounds like our devil dance actually worked this time.
'Bout time...
There's our man.
Mr. Sleepyhead must have some major ties to the dark side.
What's with that guy?
Gotta be one of his disciples or something.
Yo, man, I think that devil guy just got ripped off.
Should we wake him up?
Should we wake him up?
Yeah. You do it.
Did you check out the dragon mouth?
The Dark Prince is here.
Look who's back from the dead.
Six, six, six, pick up sticks.
That's a big pass, Elton John.
We're going to see Ozzy play at the Meadowlands, right now. Wanna come, Nicky?
You sure you're down with this?
Little nervous. Wanna puke.
Looking for the chief.
We know where to find Nicky.
Schnapps...
Peppermint... alright.
This don't look good.
Can't Beefy use his penis powers to get us out of this?
Which way did he go?
That way.
What's Ozzy trying to say there?
Absolutely nothing. The Blizzard always came straight with his messages. But wrap your minds around this one.
Come on. One more time.
Not again, fellas. It kind of hurts.
No thanks. I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to give Ozzy the focus he deserves.
Whoa, that chick must be the real deal, then. Later on.
Whoa, that chick must be the real deal, then. Later on.
See ya, fellas.
So I was driving to work today, and some bozo in a Cadillac cut me off...
Oh, that's terrible, Reege...
Oh, that's terrible, Reege...
So I followed him...
So I followed him...
You followed him?
You followed him?
I followed him all the way downtown, and when he gets out of the car, I reach under my seat and pull out an aluminum bat.

Recently, yes! So I run up behind this guy, and start bashing his brains in with this bat, and it made me feel happy! Did you ever see THE UNTOUCHABLES?

Yes, great movie...
Yes, great movie...
I was DeNiro!
Please. You got to.
All right...
I'm not Nicky. I'm not home! I don't live here!
Dude, it's us. Let us in.
Good idea... kill me.
Dude. Seriously?
Dude. Seriously?
Yes. I'll meet you at Grand Central at noon. Okay. Do me. I command you.
You gotta kill yourself.
I'll just go to Heaven.
Hello.
You smell like coconuts.
You smell like coconuts.
It's "Comptoir Sud Pacific." Makes me feel like a hula girl. Which is kinda what I'm going for. Wanna come in?

No thanks. I'm looking for a girl named Valerie who also smells like coconuts.

I don't need luck. I'm good.
Adrian?
Andrew.
You got the wrong window again, man.
Oh. Sorry, Andrew. Valerie?
That was amazing. Thanks so much. You didn't have to do that.
That's okay. I get messed with all the time and when I saw him doing that to you I just lost it. I hate when people take advantage of tourists. It ruins it for the rest of us.

I'm sorry. I just assumed. Your accent maybe. Where are you from?

Yeah. Deep south. She laughs along with him, not sure why.

I don't know, but I like it. Say. Your glasses are nice. They make your eyes look sparkly and big. It's fun to look at them.

If I don't save him, I don't know what I'm gonna do.
If I don't save him, I don't know what I'm gonna do.
Well, I'm sure a nice southern boy like you will figure something out.
Here, have a Popeye's. This drumstick ain't for beatin' it's for eatin'.
That's alright. I already ate lunch. I actually wouldn't mind getting a Gelati.
That's alright. I already ate lunch. I actually wouldn't mind getting a Gelati.
Could I come with you to getting a Gelati?

If you want to.

Want to? A million angry octopus people couldn't hold me back!
Want to? A million angry octopus people couldn't hold me back!
"Octopus people?"
"Octopus people?"
Uh, it's a deep south expression.
It's freezing my hands.
It's not that cold. Here, let me wrap it.
This town is really going to hell lately. So what part of the city do you live in?
I have an apartment. I don't remember exactly where. My dog knows, though.

You have a dog? What kind?

I'm not sure. I'd ask him, but he's uptown talking to his contacts.
I'd love to have a dog. But I go to school full time. It wouldn't be fair to the dog.
School?
School?
Parsons School of Design. I knew growing up I wasn't much to look at, so I put my energy into making things that are pretty.

What's that pleasant smell coming from, your skin?
What's that pleasant smell coming from, your skin?
My perfume?
Valerie, it feels like there's a bunch of butterflies flapping around in my stomach. Is that normal?
Sometimes, sure.
Sometimes, sure.
Good. I was concerned.
So you're saying, make all pants with a drawstring, then heavier set gals don't have to feel humiliated by telling their waist size in front of the whole store?
Basically, yeah.
Basically, yeah.
Wow. Maybe you should make drawstring socks for gals with fat ankles.
You know what's nice about you? You just seem happy being yourself. You don't try to act cool.
Thanks much. You know what's nice about you, Valerie?
Thanks much. You know what's nice about you, Valerie?
What?
Your juicy, heart-shaped ass.
What was that?
What was that?
I... I don't know why I just said that. I meant to say that...
Hey.
Nicky? Oh my God. Stay right there.
What were you thinking coming here?
I'm not sure, but it didn't involve getting blinded with poison.
Valerie?
Are you dead?
Are you dead?
No.
No.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
I think I'm floating.
I think I'm floating.
Why would you be floating?
Why would you be floating?
I don't know. Maybe it's because of your sweet voice.
I don't know. Maybe it's because of your sweet voice.
Am I supposed to not be freaked out right now? Because I am.
Look, just because you're floating doesn't mean I'm gonna forget about you giving me the finger.
That wasn't me. I was being possessed by my brother, Adrian. He's the one who call you a gross pig.
That wasn't me. I was being possessed by my brother, Adrian. He's the one who call you a gross pig.
What do you mean, "possessed?"
What do you mean, "possessed?"
Remember when I told you my Dad was in Hell?
Remember when I told you my Dad was in Hell?
Yes...
Yes...
Well, that's because he's the Devil. And he wants to keep his throne for another ten-thousand years. Which is fine with me, but not with my brothers, so they broke out of Hell, causing my dad...
Well, that's because he's the Devil. And he wants to keep his throne for another ten-thousand years. Which is fine with me, but not with my brothers, so they broke out of Hell, causing my dad...
..."The Devil?"...
..."The Devil?"...
...to decompose. And I love my Dad very much. So I came to Earth to save him but then crazy eyes stole my flask and I met you and... well, my dog tells me I just might be in love with you.
You gotta believe me. You gotta believe in the butterflies.
Okay, I do. Get back up here.
Can we go fly over Central Park?
Next time. Tonight, I want to share the most beautiful thing I could possibly imagine.
We're going to Jersey?
East Rutherford.
I never thought I'd ever see Ozzy live until he was dead. Please tell me you like metal.
"Mister Crowley, what's inside of your head..."
Don't do it.
I have to, Valerie.
Nicky!
That was Cassius!
Where'd a sweet Southern boy learn to fight like that?
From my dad's side of the family.
Do me.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
Hello, friend, my name is Nicky. I understand you're seeking a roommate, as per your advertisement in the Village Voice. Would it be possible for me to fill the slot?
Uh, don't you want to know what the rent is?
Yes. What is rent?
Eight-hundred, split down the middle. Tuesdays and Thursdays I rehearse with my scene partner so the living room will be off limits.
Eight-hundred, split down the middle. Tuesdays and Thursdays I rehearse with my scene partner so the living room will be off limits.
Off limits.
Off limits.
Right. And as far as household items: we can share the soap, but we'll split the cost 60/40. Cause the person who physically goes out and buys the soap shouldn't have to pay as much as the other guy. Aren't you boiling in that outfit?

It's like eighty degrees in this hallway. You from the South?
It's like eighty degrees in this hallway. You from the South?
Yeah. The deep South.
Why is that funny?
I don't know.
I don't know.
And sorry, man, but no dogs allowed.
It looks like the work of a brother...
A black guy?
A black guy?
If it's Cassius, yes.
A little strange. I can't stop thinking about this girl, Valerie.
Why? Did she hurt you? Do you miss her? Need a shoulder to cry on?
That just hurt a lot.
I've always wanted to kill someone. Can I do it?
Hey...
See something you like, my man?
See something you like, my man?
Yes. I would like my flask back.
You callin' me a thief, my man?
No, I'm just calling you... a guy who has my flask.
No, I'm just calling you... a guy who has my flask.
And if that is your so-called "flask," how would I have it unless I was, in fact, a thief?
And if that is your so-called "flask," how would I have it unless I was, in fact, a thief?
I don't know?
Okay, now you gone and done it. You done messed with my business bitch!
Sir, I would prefer if you didn't raise your voice. It's making my muscles tighten.
I'm a Sandman!
I cut up a Sandman yesterday. They said I'd never get him... but I cut him up good, I did.
I cut up a Sandman yesterday. They said I'd never get him... but I cut him up good, I did.
I feel sorry for you, boy!
For me? Better feel sorry for yourself, Sandman!
No, for you! How old are you, Billy?
Fourteen? Fifteen? Your days are running out. How long can you last? A year. Six months? What happens when you're sixteen and you go green?
Nothing will happen! I make the rules as I go!! Cubs do what I say! Always have! Always will! I got Cathedral and I'll never let go!
Nothing will happen! I make the rules as I go!! Cubs do what I say! Always have! Always will! I got Cathedral and I'll never let go!
No cubs over fifteen, Billy! Ever heard of a cub with a green flower? You'll leave Cathedral then, Billy, when you're on green, because they won't let a green stay here. If you try to stay the young ones will gut-rip you apart!

Shut up! Shut up your damn mouth!
Are you too startled? Am I too removed from your ken? I'm neither machine nor man... but a perfect fusion of the two... and better than either. No human sculptor could match this greatness... don't you agree?
All right -- what are you?
All right -- what are you?
Your turn.
We're hungry do you have anything to eat?
Anything to eat?
How do you think we got here??!!
You walked in. I saw you. Don't you remember?
Where do you think we came from?
From? From? From?
From? From? From?
We were sent here and you know it. Others have been sent here. Where are they? Hiding?
Hiding? Yes! Hiding, hiding.
Where do we go?! Where do we go from here??!!
Is that the wind? Not yet... You must hear my birds sing.
You know about Sanctuary! I know you do! You have to help us! You don't have a choice! It isn't your decision!! Tell us.
You know about Sanctuary! I know you do! You have to help us! You don't have a choice! It isn't your decision!! Tell us.
Never a pair. I have never had a pair.
Never a pair. I have never had a pair.
Where do you send them?
Where do you send them?
You're a beautiful pair.
Answer the question!
Do you know how long all this will last? Not thirty years... or thirty thousand years... but thirty thousand years... and you'll be part of it. Ages will roll... Ages. And you'll be here... the two of you... eternally frozen... frozen... beautiful.

Wait for the wind! Wait and hear the birds sing over you!

We're ready.
How did they get in here?
Regular storage procedure... the same as the other food... The other food stopped coming and they started.
Regular storage procedure... the same as the other food... The other food stopped coming and they started.
What other food?
What other food?
Fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea. It's all here -- ready -- fresh as harvest day. Fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea... And then it stopped coming and they... ...came instead. So I store them here. I'm ready. And you're ready. It's my Job -- protein, plankton, grass from the sea.
It's a real privilege, Sandman.
Thanks. I thought you'd be older. I expected a Red.
Thanks. I thought you'd be older. I expected a Red.
I am.
I am.
Your own work?
Your own work?
And I did it myself right on there.
I designed it myself. What'll it be... a face job or a full-body job?
Just the face.
Just the face.
Fine... Holly will get you ready. You're in good hands, believe me.
Do you have anything special in mind?
I don't care... Just get it over with.
I don't care... Just get it over with.
Hurry... hurry... hurry.
You are here. I couldn't believe it when they told me. What are you doing?
Turn this way. No, no... not you... YOU!
You should've seen me take my last Runner... perfect. I backed him up against a residence pool and when he terminated... his hand... So now you've seen him... what's the difference awake or asleep?
Open your eyes once, idiot. It's not every day that a Sandman son is born. I'm telling you, Francis -- that's him!
Open your eyes once, idiot. It's not every day that a Sandman son is born. I'm telling you, Francis -- that's him!
Maybe, maybe not. What's the difference? Come on, Logan, let's get out of here before everybody finds out.
Had enough?
Even the alarm didn't wake him.
You need a lift. Let's go to Arcade and celebrate... your alert successor... Logan-6.
Has anyone ever broken in to where the babies are?
Has anyone ever broken in to where the babies are?
Not in my time...
Why?
Just wondered... what happens?
Just wondered... what happens?
Dunno... flameout maybe. Whatever happens, you can bet it's final. But who would want to find out?
But you don't know, you just say what everyone says. "One for one. One for one."
Well, why not!? That's exactly how everything works. How else could the city stay in balance -- You have a better idea?
Well, why not!? That's exactly how everything works. How else could the city stay in balance -- You have a better idea?
No, but at least I wonder sometimes -- instead of doing that "one for one" song of yours. You sound like a sleepteacher with a stuck tape.
No, but at least I wonder sometimes -- instead of doing that "one for one" song of yours. You sound like a sleepteacher with a stuck tape.
Well the minute you get a better idea you can stop wondering. You know, Logan -- you wonder a lot. Too much for a Sandman.
Did you ever see Francis-8?
I never even visited Nursery before tonight. When you wonder, it slows you up -- you know?
I don't know what makes you so curious. You have any idea who his seed-mother was?
Of course not! I'm curious, not sick.
You missed something special.
Well... you can't have them all.
The damned Yellows are getting out of hand. Those three ought to be in Cathedral. No business scrambling in Arcade...
What an old, old man you're getting to be, Francis. Weren't you ever a Yellow? I bet you were even wilder than -- come on, Sandman.
You should have been with us in Nursery, Daniel. I'm positive I recognized him --
Come on. I don't want to miss the filing-in. There'll be some I know tonight, I think...
Now there's a few who could have been his seed-mother.
Only a few? You're just not trying.
Who invited you?
I'm in my party mood.
That was a great shot you made.
Yes. But you look a little rusty to me -- what were you doing, wondering?
I just might look in on New You 483 myself.
You? Why? You're already beautiful.
You? Why? You're already beautiful.
No -- it's that last Runner -- someone in 483 was trying to help him.
What the hell took you so long?
Did you ever see anybody renew?
Did you ever see anybody renew?
I think you've been skulling out too much. First Nursery and now stupid questions.

At Carousel tonight?
What's going on, Logan?!
It has nothing to do with you.
It has nothing to do with you.
What are you talking about?! I saw you let a Runner go? I saw you, Logan?? Tell me!!
Why did you do that??!!
I didn't do anything, Francis! They've made us believe that...
I didn't do anything, Francis! They've made us believe that...
Why did you do that???!!!
It's him! The first Sandman. He killed... Doc.
No, Holly -- wait! He's running. Tell them the rest!
No, Holly -- wait! He's running. Tell them the rest!
He's the one. You too. I remember. He was in a hurry. Just a face job. Dark hair, I said. Then he killed Doc and you grabbed me -- and the machine blew up and I ran... I ran.
He's the one. You too. I remember. He was in a hurry. Just a face job. Dark hair, I said. Then he killed Doc and you grabbed me -- and the machine blew up and I ran... I ran.
Holly. Holly! Please... The other Sandman. Remember the one who came after --
That's right. The other one came after. The older one. Smashing, killing, burning!
...and he was hunting the first one, this one. Wasn't he? Wasn't he? This one was running, the other one was hunting him...
...and he was hunting the first one, this one. Wasn't he? Wasn't he? This one was running, the other one was hunting him...
Yes. Oh yes. He was after you. I remember. You're running!

When do you go up?
When do you go up?
I never go upstairs. You're a nice old lady.
What's wrong, Available?

You're sure you don't want to try?
You could have called me yourself.
But I wasn't sure you'd come.

We're coming to Arcade. Shall we Relive together?
A Runner... Cathedral. A woman.
You're not going, are you?
You're not going, are you?
Why not? Maybe she'll help me. You won't. You'd better stay here.
I'd rather be with you.
That's nice.
They're like beasts. Wild.

Let's see -- how long has it been?
Just follow -- no matter how it seems...
But what is this -- why?

The Cubs. When they're flying on muscle there's no way to catch up. Without the dazzle, they'd just go past us -- -- too fast
Muscle? I don't know that one.
I'm ashamed. I was bringing you to be killed.
Where? Sanctuary? Can you take me there?
Where? Sanctuary? Can you take me there?
Logan, I don't know where Sanctuary is. But if I take you to them, they'll kill you.
Logan, I don't know where Sanctuary is. But if I take you to them, they'll kill you.
All right. But why? I didn't kill the Runner.
All right. But why? I didn't kill the Runner.
Yes, but they won't know that... or care. They're hunting you, Logan. Maybe me too, now...
Yes, but they won't know that... or care. They're hunting you, Logan. Maybe me too, now...
That's nothing... there's a Sandman behind us, too and there'll be more soon. Take me to them.

I -- I can't.

No. Not that either.
Are you taking me to them?

Because he's my friend -- and I don't want to be killed by him -- or anyone.
He's good, isn't he?

Will he find us and kill us? Yes... or one of the others. You know there's only one place to go now...
Will he find us and kill us? Yes... or one of the others. You know there's only one place to go now...

They won't listen.
They won't listen.
You think Sandmen will? There's no other way for me,
You think Sandmen will? There's no other way for me,
We'll convince them.
Exactly four steps now. Let me lead you. Now to the right. It's narrow here, you'll have to get behind me.
How will they know we're coming?
How will they know we're coming?
They're watching us now. They'll let us in when they're sure.
Will you take me with you?
Why, Jessica? You're still a green.
How do we know this is the right way?
It's the only way.
What do you suppose this was...?
Some kind of breeding pens... I suppose... They say people used to breed animals, fish, anything... ...to eat, of course.
Some kind of breeding pens... I suppose... They say people used to breed animals, fish, anything... ...to eat, of course.
Ycch. To kill things and then eat them. It must have been a savage world.
I'm afraid.
It's brighter there... besides, we can't go back.
I don't know what's going to happen to us Logan but -- Are you glad you didn't kill him?
It doesn't make any difference anymore.
It doesn't make any difference anymore.
You're really one of us now, aren't you?
You're really one of us now, aren't you?
You knew that I wasn't before, didn't you? Why did you stay with me?
You knew that I wasn't before, didn't you? Why did you stay with me?
I wanted to... ...And you... what made you kill Sandmen?
I wanted to... ...And you... what made you kill Sandmen?
I had to. I did kill... for the first time in my life I killed.
I had to. I did kill... for the first time in my life I killed.
Because you felt like a Runner, didn't you.
Because you felt like a Runner, didn't you.
I guess so... I know I felt something I never felt before... and I didn't like it... not a bit. I'll tell you one thing... Sanctuary better be worth it. That's the last place for me to live now.
I guess so... I know I felt something I never felt before... and I didn't like it... not a bit. I'll tell you one thing... Sanctuary better be worth it. That's the last place for me to live now.
For us.
What's that?
It feels like breath. It makes everything move. Your hair is moving.
It feels like breath. It makes everything move. Your hair is moving.
And yours.
I hate outside! I hate it!
We'll be all right... We will...
Don't!
Sooner or later, we'll have to try something.
It's getting dark and cold. I'm tired.
Why don't we rest here? We know we can eat these.
Do you think everything's going to turn to ice?
I doubt it.
I doubt it.
Don't ever let go.
Don't ever let go.
I won't.
It all seemed to make sense until Box.
Do you think he was telling the Truth?
Maybe we're the first ones to get through... Maybe Sanctuary is near, now... another protected place. It couldn't be outside.
How would anyone know? Even if we find it -- we can never go back.
You're right... it must be near now. We'll find it.
Thirty thousand years didn't last very long, did they?
What does it mean?
The Lifeclocks have no power outside.
You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want?
You know, Jessica.
You know, Jessica.
...But I still have the choice...?
...But I still have the choice...?
Of course.
Of course.
Then the answer's yes...
I have never seen a face like that before. It must be the look of great age. Whoever he was he was terribly old.
Yes, do you think that's why he looks so sad?
They all have names and numbers on them. I wonder what they are?
"Beloved Husband". "Beloved Wife". What can all that mean?
Look at his face... and his hair... Is that what it is to grow old?
It could be...
That sweet madman -- how could he come to exist?
He had a mother and father -- and he knew them.
He had a mother and father -- and he knew them.
One in a million, I suppose
There's a Sanctuary... there is!
You want there to be one... that doesn't...
You want there to be one... that doesn't...
There has to be! I know it exists! It has to!!
There has to be! I know it exists! It has to!!
No, there doesn't. Not really -- just so many want it to exist... so many who don't want to die... want it so much that a place called Sanctuary becomes "real". But it doesn't exist. It never existed. Just the hope.
No, there doesn't. Not really -- just so many want it to exist... so many who don't want to die... want it so much that a place called Sanctuary becomes "real". But it doesn't exist. It never existed. Just the hope.
You're wrong!! It has to be!! It Just has to be!!
What are we promising him? What can we possibly give him?
He asked if we would bury him when his time comes.
He asked if we would bury him when his time comes.
We can't. We're going back.
We can't. We're going back.
To what?

I'm going to try and tell people what we've seen and --

Do you expect me to let things go on without trying to change them?!

Things won't change... you know that! We can live here together, Logan... have a life as long as his... together!
Things won't change... you know that! We can live here together, Logan... have a life as long as his... together!
Things change!
Things change!
You want to go back to kill, is that it?! Now, you'll want to kill your own!!! Kill Sandmen!!! Killing's all you ever...!!!
Jessica... listen to me... listen to me... The Lifeclocks made me kill Francis. They make people die or be killed every day. If I didn't try and destroy that... I couldn't live here or anywhere. Do you understand?
I want to be alive and with you, that's all I want.
"Beloved son"... So people stayed together for that feeling of love... They would live and raise children together and be remembered. I think I feel that way, Logan. Can we be that way?
Yes. You and I, Jessica.
Yes. You and I, Jessica.
And Sanctuary?
And Sanctuary?
Sanctuary is the right to live... nothing more. But nothing less, either...
Beloved husband...
Beloved wife...

Is it inside the city?
Is it inside the city?
Of course. I don't know where... I just took them for granted. It's our only chance.
Yes, cats, of course. What else could they be? Cats. Of course each one has his own name too.
But there are so many of them. Do you know each one separately.
But there are so many of them. Do you know each one separately.
Yes indeed, everyone. Actually, they all have three. "The naming of cats is a difficult matter. It isn't just one of your holiday games. You may think at first I'm mad as a hatter when I tell you a cat must have THREE DIFFERENT NAMES." An ordinary name and a fancy name. That's two. Do you want to guess what the third one is?
And... and how were you grown? Inside your mother?
Yes...
Yes...
Are you sure?
Are you sure?
Mother and Father said so... you know?
What kind of jewel is this?
I don't know.
I don't know.
You're both full of secrets like Macavity. Did you steal this?
You're both full of secrets like Macavity. Did you steal this?
No.
No.
"Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity, There never was a cat of such deceitfulness and suavity."
What belongs to the people?
All this. All of it.
All this. All of it.
What people?
What people?
I don't know... but it does.
We'll have to bury him.
What's that?
What's that?
They're put into the ground so they can be visited by the living...
I'll make the arrangements.
At least it's over...
Of course... that's settled then. But just you remember your promise...
We'll remember. But that's a long time off...
Come with us.
Where are you going?
Goodbye.
Oh, my...
Hello, Sandman.
Hello.
Hello.
Do you want to see Doc?
We don't get many Sandmen. I think we've only had one other since I've been here.
A Sandman can get as sick of his face as anyone else. Where's the doctor?

I like your face. Would you mind if Doc took a picture? I'd like him to give your face to somebody else.
I like your face. Would you mind if Doc took a picture? I'd like him to give your face to somebody else.
It's all right with me. Is he here?

No -- Look, I'm in a hurry.
How long have you been living here?
For as long as I can remember.

What kind of place is this?

Just a place, I suppose... who knows?
How did you get here?
I have always been here...
I have always been here...
Are there any other humans?
Are there any other humans?
Gracious... no.
Gracious... no.
Have any other people ever passed through?
But there may be a few around somewhere.
What makes you think so?
What makes you think so?
My parents thought so. Mother and Father. You know?
My parents thought so. Mother and Father. You know?
Mother and -- ? You knew your mother and father?
Where are they?
Dead... they're dead... and buried.
They're beautiful. May I have one too please?
No -- I'm sorry. It's not possible.
No -- I'm sorry. It's not possible.
It isn't fair. I'll give you one of my favorite cats... a Jellicle cat. "Jellicle cats have cheerful faces, Jellicle cats have bright black eyes; They like to practice their airs and graces And wait for the Jellicle Moon to rise."
It isn't fair. I'll give you one of my favorite cats... a Jellicle cat. "Jellicle cats have cheerful faces, Jellicle cats have bright black eyes; They like to practice their airs and graces And wait for the Jellicle Moon to rise."
I'm sorry but I don't have anything to give you.
What's beyond this place -- do you know?
No, no, no
No, no, no
Did your Mother or Father ever mention another place?
Did your Mother or Father ever mention another place?
Never, never, ever. Nothing.
May we stay here for a while? We'd like to rest.
Of course you can stay. This belongs to the people.
Are you ready to put him in?
Not yet.
Not yet.
All right.
We're leaving.
What a pity. I was hoping you'd be here to bury me.
To a city with thousands and thousands of people.
Alive?
Thousands and thousands... as many as my cats?
More... many more.
More... many more.
And all alive you say?
Is that really it? It doesn't seem very far. Will we be there soon?
I promise. We'll go on as soon as it's light.
That's better than gold when it's cold.
Thank you. Tell me -- what do those words mean? "Beloved husband"... "Beloved son"... "Beloved wife"...
Thank you. Tell me -- what do those words mean? "Beloved husband"... "Beloved son"... "Beloved wife"...
My father was the husband and my mother was the wife. "Beloved" is a word they used -- to stay together.

Stay? They lived together all their years?

Oh, yes... I think...

Oh... I did so look forward to seeing all those people.
Oh... I did so look forward to seeing all those people.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

It doesn't matter who we are. Follow the tunnel to the end.
Will there be someone to tell us where to go from there...?
Someone will follow. When you come to the lock, he will tell you how to go on the other side. Jessica may go with you as far as the lock.
No. Jessica goes back now. Take her back. Now! Go on back. Back outside, Jessica.
Well? How do you like it?

No -- just there -- on the first level. Don't look for us. We'll see you.
You don't seem quite sure, Jessica. Can you do it? Will you?
You're not contagious are you?
I don't think so.
I don't think so.

Do you always sleep here?... In this room?... Both of you?
This is our bedroom.
You're a musician?
Yes, I thought my wife...
I like to remember things my own way.
What do you mean by that?
What do you mean by that?
How I remember them. Not necessarily the way they happened.
Why not?
It kept going off for some reason. False alarms.
Why not?
I forgot. Anyway, I hate the idea of acting paranoid.
Very strange.
What is?
What is?
The angle. The high angle shot on the tape.
Do you own a video camera?
No. Fred hates them.
No.
Maid? Relative?
Maid? Relative?
No, one of us is always here to let the maid in. Nobody else has a key.
We'll see that the patrol of the house is doubled.
I don't know if I want to stay here. I don't feel safe.
How'd the camera get so high like that?
And smooth... Almost no movement - back and forth, I mean.
And smooth... Almost no movement - back and forth, I mean.
Like you'd get if it was hand held.
Like you'd get if it was hand held.
Right... This just glided along.
Might be a good time to try using it again.
Anybody else have a key to the house.
We'll keep a watch on the house.
As best we can.
As best we can.
If anything else happens, you'll call us.
You don't remember being awakened? It looks like you were aware of someone.
Or something.
Has anyone made any threats to either of you recently?
Or not so recently?
Now we'll see what this son of a bitch is up to.
Yeah.
You recognize that guy?
Yeah... Laurent.
What a fuckin' job.
His or ours?
His or ours?
Ours, Ed.
We've got Pete Dayton's prints all over this place.
You know what I think?
You know what I think?
What's that, Ed?

There's no such thing as a bad coincidence.

How about Madison? Have we had even a hint of his whereabouts?
Nothing, Marsh. Vanished. There's an APB out on him. His photo's been faxed nationwide.
One of the guards must have leaked it.
What's the word on the street?
You just gonna let him go?
We'll get a tail put on him.
Now, Mack, what's the situation?
I'm not entirely certain, Captain. You'll have to see for yourself.

Not even close.
I examined Madison last night, Marshall. He had a headache.
A headache?

I did a routine once-over, and gave him a sleeping pill. I've never seen this man before. Neither have the guards. I don't think he's in the system.

Look at me. Look at what they gave me to wear.
Look at me. Look at what they gave me to wear.
You never looked better in your life. As soon as our clothes are cleaned, they're going to give them back to us, Lovey.
Something tells me this means food. Come on!
I just feel as though I'm being made ready for the executioner.
Yeah? If this be execution, lead me to it.
That's what they do with cattle just before the slaughter. Fatten them.
That's what they do with cattle just before the slaughter. Fatten them.
Uh-huh. You're a scream, Lovey.
Uh-huh. You're a scream, Lovey.
Please don't call me Lovey.
Some layout they got here. Did you get a load of the rooms? You couldn't do better at the Ritz.
All the conveniences for the condemned, if you ask me.
Don't mind Lovey. He's got the misery.
Mr. Conway, I don't like this place. I don't like it. It's too mysterious.
How about you Lovey? Come on. Let's you and I play a game of honeymoon bridge.
I'm thinking.
I'm thinking.
Thinking? What about some double solitaire?
Thinking? What about some double solitaire?
As a matter of fact, I'm very good at double solitaire.
As a matter of fact, I'm very good at double solitaire.
No kidding?
No kidding?
Yes.
Yes.
Then I'm your man. Come on, Toots.
And say, honey, you look a million per cent better. Wholesome, kind of - and clean. You take a tip from me, and don't you ever put that stuff on your face again. Why, it's like hiding behind a mask.
Ha, ha - who are you to be talking about a mask? What do you mean? You've been wearing a mask ever since we met you.
Ha, ha - who are you to be talking about a mask? What do you mean? You've been wearing a mask ever since we met you.
Have I?
Have I?
It's very strange, you know. You've never told us anything about yourself. Who are you, anyway? Why don't you take your mask off for once!
Certainly not.
Believe me, it's no fun. When you fellas picked me up at Baskul, they'd been on my tail for a year.
Believe me, it's no fun. When you fellas picked me up at Baskul, they'd been on my tail for a year.
The police?
The police?
Uh-huh. Did you ever hear of Chalmers Bryant?
That's too bad. I got a half million shares. My whole foundation! And now look at me!
colossal nerve you have sitting there and talking about it so calmly - you, the swindler of thousands of people
colossal nerve you have sitting there and talking about it so calmly - you, the swindler of thousands of people
You know, that's what makes the whole thing so funny. A guy like me starts out in life as a plumber - an ordinary, everyday, slew-footed plumber - and by the use of a little brains, mind you, he builds up a gigantic institution, employs thousands of people, becomes a great civic leader. And then the crash comes - and overnight he's the biggest

You are a thief, sir, and a swindler, and I, for one, will be only too glad to turn you over to the police when we get back.
Yes.
Sounds like a stall to me.
I don't know why I associate with you, Mr. Barnard - or Mr. Chalmers Bryant - or Mr. Embezzler - or whatever your name may be.
Just call me Barney.
Just call me Barney.
Barney? Why should I? Never! We have nothing in common. Hmmpf, Barney! What effrontery!
Barney? Why should I? Never! We have nothing in common. Hmmpf, Barney! What effrontery!
Okay, Lovey.
Okay, Lovey.
And this trip to the valley. I can't imagine why I'd allow you to drag me down here. Why, we don't know anything about these people. We're not even armed!
And this trip to the valley. I can't imagine why I'd allow you to drag me down here. Why, we don't know anything about these people. We're not even armed!
They're very nice people - except that they've got horns.

Horns?
Yeah. You know.
Horns? What kind of horns?
Hey Lovey, come here! Lovey, I asked for a glass of wine and look what I got. Come on, sit down.
So that's where you are. I might of known it. No wonder you couldn't hear me.
So that's where you are. I might of known it. No wonder you couldn't hear me.

Certainly not!
There you are!
This doesn't obligate me in any way.
then the bears came right into the bedroom and the little baby bear said, "Oh, somebody's been sleeping in my bed." And then the mama bear said, "Oh dear, somebody's been sleeping in my bed!" And then the big papa bear, he roared, "And somebody's been sleeping in my bed!" Well, you have to admit the poor little bears were in a quandary!
I'm going to sleep in my bed. Come on, Lovey!
I'm going to sleep in my bed. Come on, Lovey!
They were in a quandary, and
They were in a quandary, and
Come on, Lovey.
Come on, Lovey.
Why? Why 'come on' all the time? What's the matter? Are you going to be a fuss budget all your life? Here, drink it up! Aren't you having any fun? Where was I?
Why? Why 'come on' all the time? What's the matter? Are you going to be a fuss budget all your life? Here, drink it up! Aren't you having any fun? Where was I?
In a quandary.
Oh my, isn't that pretty! What is it?
Plumbing. Everything modern. I'm going to run pipes all through the village
Charming chap.
Nice puss to meet in a dark alley.
Well, that's that, I guess.
Wonder what's happened to Fenner.
What are we going to do?
Well, there's nothing we can do until the morning.
It's better than freezing to death down below, isn't it?
I'll say.
That's what I say. What do you say to a rubber of bridge? I saw some cards in the other room.
Not for me, thanks. No, I'm too weary.
Hey, hurry up, you slow-pokes - I'm starved!
Please! Please! Do not wait for me! I eat so very little.
Yes. Unbosom yourself, Mr. Hyde.[11]
All right, I will! I'll let my hair down! Why not? It can't make any real difference now. Hey Lovey, were you ever chased by the police?
Chalmers Bryant!
Bryant's Utilities - that's me.
Yeah. I though you ran this joint.
Mr. Chang - High Lamas or Low Lamas, do we get the porters?
You see? You get the idea? From this reservoir here I can pipe in the whole works. Oh, I'm going to get a great kick out of this. Of course it's just to keep my hand in, but with the equipment we have here, I can put a plumbing system in for the whole village down there. Can rig it up in no time.
It's unbelievable.
It's unbelievable.
Think of it! In times like these.

Say, what about that gold deal?

Huh?
Huh?
Gold. You were going to
Gold. You were going to
Oh - that! That can wait. Nobody's going to run off with it. Say, I've got to get busy. I want to show this whole layout to Chang. So long. Don't you take any wooden nickels.
Oh - that! That can wait. Nobody's going to run off with it. Say, I've got to get busy. I want to show this whole layout to Chang. So long. Don't you take any wooden nickels.
All right.
I say, will you have a cigarette?
No.
No.
Say, you're an American, aren't you?
Say, you're an American, aren't you?
Say, listen - will you go and annoy the rest of your playmates? Let me alone!
Hey, what's happened to you?
Nothing. Why?
Nothing. Why?
Why, you look beautiful.
Look, honey. We run the pipes through here, and we connect with the main water line here.
Pipes? Where are you going to get pipes?
Pipes? Where are you going to get pipes?
Oh, that's a cinch. I'll show them how to cast pipes out of clay.
If you want me to!
Sure - sure. Don't you worry. I'll take care of you.
Cave, eh? Where?
Over by that hill.
Hey - look!
Look, Bob!
There you are! Barnard, you'd better get your things together. We're leaving.
Leaving?
Leaving?
Yes. I've just been talking with the porters. They're going to take us. We've got clothing, food, everything. Come on!
Yes. I've just been talking with the porters. They're going to take us. We've got clothing, food, everything. Come on!
When are you going to start?
When are you going to start?
Right this very minute! The porters are waiting for us on the plateau. And that Chinaman thought he could stop me. Come along.

Well - I'm

I see. You're afraid of going to jail, eh?

All right! If you insist on being an idiot, I'm not going to waste time coaxing you. How about you?
Oh, no - you don't want to go yet, honey. She'll stick around too. Is that right?
And mine's Conway.
How do you do?
How do you do?
You've no idea, sir, how unexpected and very welcome you are. My friends and I - and the lady in the plane - left Baskul night before last for Shanghai, but we suddenly found ourselves traveling in the opposite direction
Where is your mad pilot?
He must have had a heart attack, or perhaps the fumes. When the plane landed he was dead.
You will need suitable clothes for the journey. It is not particularly far, but quite difficult.
Thank you.
And the wine - excellent.
I'm glad you like it. It's made right here in the valley.
It's three thousand feet, practically straight down to the floor of the valley. The Valley of the Blue Moon, as we call it. There are over two thousand people in the Valley besides those here in Shangri-La.
Who and what is Shangri-La? You?
Who and what is Shangri-La? You?
Goodness, no!
Goodness, no!
So there are others?
So there are others?
Oh, yes.
Oh, yes.
Who, for instance?

In time you will meet them all.
For a man who talks a great deal, it's amazing how unenlightening you can be.
There are some things, my dear Conway, I deeply regret I may not discuss.

You know, that's the fourth time you've said that today. You should have a record made of it.
You know, that's the fourth time you've said that today. You should have a record made of it.
Shall we go inside? I should so like to show you some of our rare treasures.
By the way, what religion do you follow here?
We follow many.
To put it simply, I should say that our general belief was in moderation. We preach the virtue of avoiding excesses of every kind, even including the excess of virtue itself.
That's intelligent.
That's intelligent.
We find, in the Valley, it makes for better happiness among the natives. We rule with moderate strictness and in return we are satisfied with moderate obedience. As a result, our people are moderately honest and moderately chaste and somewhat more than moderately happy.

How about law and order? You have no soldiers or police?

Oh, good heavens, no!

How do you deal with incorrigibles? Criminals?
How do you deal with incorrigibles? Criminals?
Why, we have no crime here. What makes a criminal? Lack, usually. Avariciousness, envy, the desire to possess something owned by another. There can be no crime where there is a sufficiency of everything.

You have no disputes over women?

Only very rarely. You see, it would not be considered good manners to take a woman that another man wanted.

That's very convenient. I think I'd like that.
You'd be surprised, my dear Conway, how a little courtesy all around helps to smooth out the most complicated problems.
But Mr. Chang, all these things - books, instruments, sculpture - do you mean to say they were all brought in over those mountains by porters?
They were.
They were.
Well, it must have taken
Well, it must have taken
Centuries.
Centuries.
Centuries! Where did you get the money to pay for all those treasures?
Centuries! Where did you get the money to pay for all those treasures?
Of course we have no money as you know it. We do not buy or sell or seek personal fortunes because, well, because there is no uncertain future here for which to accumulate it.
That would suit me perfectly. I'm always broke. How did you pay for them?
Our Valley is very rich in a metal called gold, which fortunately for us is valued very highly in the outside world. So we merely . . .

I see. Gold for ideas. You know Mr. Chang, there's something so simple and naive about all of this that I suspect there has been a shrewd, guiding intelligence somewhere. Whose idea was it? How did it all start?

That, my dear Conway, is the story of a remarkable man.
That, my dear Conway, is the story of a remarkable man.
Who?
Who?
A Belgian priest by the name of Father Perrault, the first European to find this place, and a very great man indeed. He is responsible for everything you see here. He built Shangri-La, taught our natives, and began our collection of art. In fact, Shangri-La is Father Perrault.

When was all this?
When was all this?
Oh, let me see - way back in 1713, I think it was, that Father Perrault stumbled into the Valley, half frozen to death. It was typical of the man that, one leg being frozen, and of course there being no doctors here, he amputated the leg himself.

He amputated his own leg?
He amputated his own leg?
Yes. Oddly enough, later, when he had learned to understand their language, the natives told him he could have saved his leg. It would have healed without amputation.

Well, they didn't actually mean that.
Well, they didn't actually mean that.
Yes, yes. They were very sincere about it too. You see, a perfect body in perfect health is the rule here. They've never known anything different. So what was true for them they thought would naturally be true for anyone else living here.

Well, is it?
Well, is it?
Rather astonishingly so, yes. And particularly so in the case of Father Perrault himself. Do you know when he and the natives were finished building Shangri-La, he was 108 years old and still very active, in spite of only having one leg?

Forgive me. I should have told you it is quite common here to live to a very ripe old age. Climate, diet, mountain water, you might say. But we like to believe it is the absence of struggle in the way we live. In your countries, on the other hand, how often do you hear the expression, "He worried himself to death?" or, "This

Why, Mr. Conway, you surprise me!

I surprise you? Now that's news.

I mean, your amazement. I could have understood it in any of your companions, but you - who have dreamed and written so much about better worlds. Or is it that you fail to recognize one of your own dreams when you see it?

Then everything is quite all right, isn't it?
One moment. You say the High Lama is the only one who can give us any information?
The only one.
The only one.
And he can arrange for the porters to take us back?

Shall we have another?

No thanks. Not tonight if you don't mind.
Charming, isn't she?
Yes, charming.
Yes, charming.
Your brother seems quite fascinated by her.

Why not? She's an attractive young woman.

Young? She arrived here in 1888. She was 20 at the time. She was on her way to join her betrothed - when her carriers lost their way in the mountains. The whole party would have perished but for meeting some of our people.

Amazing! She still doesn't look over 20. When is she likely to grow old in appearance?

It's weird. Chang, how old are you?

Age is a limit we impose upon ourselves. You know, each time you Westerners celebrate your birthday, you build another fence around your minds.
You must prevail upon him not to attempt the journey. He could never get through that country alive.
I can't let him go alone. It's suicide!
What do you want?
I've offered you some warm broth. I thought perhaps-
I've offered you some warm broth. I thought perhaps-
You get out of here! If any of you men think you can come busting in here-

Sure, you can help me! You can help me jump over that cliff! I've been looking and looking at the bottom of that mountain, but I haven't got the nerve to jump!
You shouldn't be looking at the bottom of the mountain. Why don't you try looking up at the top sometimes?
You shouldn't be looking at the bottom of the mountain. Why don't you try looking up at the top sometimes?
Don't preach that cheap, second- hand stuff to me! Go on, beat it. Beat it!
Of course, the porters will be very well paid - that is, within reason.
I'm afraid that wouldn't help. You see, we have no porters here.
I'm afraid that wouldn't help. You see, we have no porters here.
No porters here!!
No porters here!!
No.
What exactly do you mean by "almost any time now"?
Well, we've been expecting this particular shipment for the past two years.
You know, it's very, very strange, but when you saw me in the corridor, I was actually on my way to you. I bring the most amazing news. The High Lama wishes to see you, Mr. Conway.
The High Lama! Who in blazes is he?!
Amazing, Mr. Chang. This place is amazing! And that marble quarry in the valley is simply magnificent. Oh, I've looked around. I've seen everything. Your woodworkers and your cloth-weavers - they all seem so very, very happy.
Yes.
Yes.
You may not know it, Mr. Chang, but right here you have Utopia.[15]

You've very kind Mr. Lovett.

I don't mean it in that sense. I only give credit where credit is due. Er, Mr. Chang, I'm very anxious to have you realize that I never for a moment believed that ridiculous kidnapping story.

Oh, I'm so glad.
Oh, I'm so glad.
Simply preposterous. Do you know what I did last night? Last night, Mr. Chang, I held a sort of a self- inventory. I said to myself last night, Mr. Chang, I said, "Lovey" Mr. Lovett! "Mr. Lovett," I said, "you are an ungrateful fool . . . "

Why, no.
Why, no.
"Ungrateful fool . . . !" Those were my very words to myself last night. "Here are these people in Shangri-La doing everything in their power to make our stay comfortable and happy and I haven't done one single thing to show my appreciation."

Now, what would you like to do?
Now, what would you like to do?
Well, Mr. Chang, I thought, with your permission of course, and while I'm waiting for these porters, I would like to organize classes for those children in the valley and teach them something practical and something useful. Geology.

Isn't it? Isn't it! You know I was a professor for twenty years? - and a very good one.
I'm sure you were. When would you like to start?
I'm sure you were. When would you like to start?
Oh, immediately.
Oh, immediately.
Then it's done.
Then it's done.
Oh, thank you. Thank you!
Oh, thank you. Thank you!
Thank you.
We were just going to bury him when you came along.
Pardon me
In that event, we better make arrangements to get some porters immediately. Some means to get us back to civilization.
Are you so certain you are away from it?
Are you so certain you are away from it?
As far away as I ever want to be.
As far away as I ever want to be.
Oh, dear.
Oh, yes. There is a tribe of porters some five hundred miles from here. That is our only contact with the outside world. Every now and again, depending upon favorable weather of course, they make the journey.
How can we get in touch with them?
How can we get in touch with them?
In that respect, you are exceedingly fortunate. We are expecting a shipment from them almost any time now
The High Lama is the only one from whom any information can come.
Don't believe him, Bob. He's just trying to get out.
A fine trick! Smart, aren't you? What a pack of lies you told us about those porters! Of course the minute they arrive, we can make arrangements to leave. If they take us. But you knew very well you'd tell them not to!
Now, my dear boy. You shouldn't
Now, my dear boy. You shouldn't
You've been lying to us ever since we got here! Apparently it's worked with some people. Perhaps it's because they lack the courage to do anything about it. But not me, Chang. You're up against the wrong man. I'll get out of here, if I have to blow this fantastic place into the valley! I'll get outporters or no porters!
It's all your fault! It was all arranged until he spoke to you! Why can't you leave us alone?
Do you mean to tell me you want to leave Shangri-La?
Do you mean to tell me you want to leave Shangri-La?
I'll die if I have to stay here another minute! I've waited a long time for this chance to go, and you're not going to stop me now. If I have to, I'll go alone. It was I who bribed the porters. If it weren't for me, you'd never get out!

I thought the porters had instructions from the High Lama not to take anyone.
I thought the porters had instructions from the High Lama not to take anyone.
The High Lama? Who pays any attention to him? The porters laugh at the High Lama. All they want to know is how much gold he will give them. Well, I gave them more gold. I've been stealing it for a year. I'd do anything to get out of this place. To get away from that High Lama - the one who calls himself

Father Perrault is dead.
Father Perrault is dead.
He's dead? That's fine. You won't see me shedding any tears over him! Oh George, you must take me with you!
He's dead? That's fine. You won't see me shedding any tears over him! Oh George, you must take me with you!
Aren't you afraid to leave? You don't want to look like an old woman, do you?
Aren't you afraid to leave? You don't want to look like an old woman, do you?
Old woman? Chang told you that, didn't he?
Old woman? Chang told you that, didn't he?
Yes.
Yes.
I thought so! He tells everyone I'm old. He wants them to stay away from me. He can't stand it when anyone comes near. He's punished me for every minute I've spent with George. If it weren't for him, I would have been out of here long ago, but he always stops me. Six months ago, I tried to escape and he locked me
You're lying, aren't you?
No, Mr. Conway, I'm not lying. What reason could I have for lying? The chances are that we'll never come out of that horrible trip alive, but I'd rather die out there in a snowstorm and be buried alive, than to stay here one more minute now.
Are you taking me?
Yes, of course. Certainly. Come on!
No, I can't! I can't! You've got to let me rest! You've got to let me rest!
Hey!
Sit here, near me. I am an old man and can do no one any harm.
Are you the High Lama?
Are you the High Lama?
Yes.
I trust you have been comfortable at Shangri-La, since your arrival.
Personally, I've enjoyed your community very much. But my friends do not care for this mystery. They are determined to leave as soon as
It's astonishing - and incredible, but
What is it, my son?
What is it, my son?
You're the man Chang told me about! You're the first - who - two hundred years ago you're still alive, Father Perrault!
You're the man Chang told me about! You're the first - who - two hundred years ago you're still alive, Father Perrault!
Sit down, my son. You may not know it, but I've been an admirer of yours for a great many years.
That Conway seemed to belong here. In fact, it was suggested that someone be sent to bring him here.
That I be brought here? Who had that brilliant idea?
That I be brought here? Who had that brilliant idea?
Sondra Bizet.
Sondra Bizet.
Oh, the girl at the piano?
Oh, the girl at the piano?
Yes. She has read your books and has a profound admiration for you, as have we all.
Yes. She has read your books and has a profound admiration for you, as have we all.
Of course I have suspected that our being here is no accident. Furthermore, I have a feeling that we're never supposed to leave. But that, for the moment, doesn't concern me greatly. I'll meet that when it comes. What particularly interests me at present is, why was I brought here? What possible use can I be to an already thriving community?

We need men like you here, to be sure that our community will continue to thrive. In return for which, Shangri-La has much to give you. You are still, by the world's standards, a youngish man. Yet in the normal course of existence, you can expect twenty or thirty years of gradually diminishing activity. Here, however, in Shangri- La, by our standards your life

But to be candid, Father, a prolonged future doesn't excite me. It would have to have a point. I've sometimes doubted whether life itself has any. And if that is so, then long life must be even more pointless. No, I'd need a much more definite reason for going on and on.

We have reason. It is the entire meaning and purpose of Shangri-La. It came to me in a vision, long, long, ago. I saw all the nations strengthening, not in wisdom, but in the vulgar passions and the will to destroy. I saw their machine power multiply until a single weaponed man might match a whole army. I foresaw a time when man, exulting
Yes, of course, your brother is a problem. It was to be expected.
I knew you'd understand. That's why I came to you for help.
I knew you'd understand. That's why I came to you for help.
You must not look to me for help. Your brother is no longer my problem. He is now your problem, Conway.
You must not look to me for help. Your brother is no longer my problem. He is now your problem, Conway.
Mine?
Mine?
Because, my son, I am placing in your hands the future and destiny of Shangri-La. For I am going to die.
I have waited for you, my son, for a long time. I have sat in this room and seen the faces of newcomers. I have looked into their eyes and heard their voices - always in hope that I might find you . My friend, it is not an arduous task that I bequeath, for our order knows only silken bonds. To be gentle
Do you think this will come in my time?
Bob! I think I hear motors!
Colonel, wait a minute, they may be here now! Say George, get down on that field and guide those planes in when they get here.
Colonel, wait a minute, they may be here now! Say George, get down on that field and guide those planes in when they get here.
Yes.
And be sure that none of the natives get in.
Yes.
Yes.
Hello? Colonel?
The power house - they've blown it up! The planes can't land without lights.
Come on! We'll burn the hangar. That will make light for them!
All right, go ahead! We go on to the next plane. Bring out any people that are left.
Right, Bob.
Bob, these are all that are left.
Come on! Quick! This way.
The next time you're in wild country like this, keep in touch with the British Consul.
Aha - very good, Freshie.[3] Very good. You'd better put his name on the list and make out a report later.
Just what I needed too.
You?
You?
Just this once, Bob. I feel like celebrating. Just think of it, Bob - a cruiser sent to Shanghai just to take you back to England. You know what it means. Here you are. Don't bother about those cables now. I want you to drink with me. Gentlemen, I give you Robert Conway - England's new Foreign Secretary.
Hurray!
How I'm going to bask in reflected glory! People are going to point to me and say, "There goes George Conway - brother of the Foreign Secretary."
How I'm going to bask in reflected glory! People are going to point to me and say, "There goes George Conway - brother of the Foreign Secretary."
Don't talk nonsense. Give me the bottle.
Hello, Freshie. Did you make that report out yet?
Yes, Bob.
Yes, Bob.
Did you say we saved ninety white people?
Did you say we saved ninety white people?
Yes.
Yes.
Hurray for us. Did you say that we left ten thousand natives down there to be annihilated? No, you wouldn't say that. They don't count.

You'd better try to get some sleep, Bob.
You'd better try to get some sleep, Bob.
Just you wait until I'm Foreign Secretary. Can't you just see me, Freshie, with all those other shrewd, little Foreign Secretaries? You see, the trick is to see who can out-talk the other. Everybody wants something for nothing, and if you can't get it with smooth talk, you send an army in. I'm going to fool them, Freshie. I'm not going to have an
Don't worry, George. Nothing's going to happen. I'll fall right into line. I'll be the good little boy that everybody wants me to be. I'll be the best little Foreign Secretary we ever had, just because I haven't the nerve to be anything else.
Do try to sleep, Bob.
Do try to sleep, Bob.
Huh? Oh, sure, Freshie. Good thing, sleep.
Oh, stop it!
The bloke up there looks a Chinese, or a Mongolian, or something.
George, what are you going to do?
I'm going to drag him out and force him to tell us what his game is.
What are these people?
I don't know. I can't get the dialect.
Oh George, come on.
It's not knowing that's so awful, Bob. Not knowing where you're going, or why, or what's waiting when you get there.
What is it? Has he fainted?
It looks like it. Smell those fumes?
He's dead.
Dead?
What is it?
See that spot?
See that spot?
Yes.
Yes.
That's where we were this morning. He had it marked. Right on the border of Tibet. Here's where civilization ends. We must be a thousand miles beyond it - just a blank on the map.
That's where we were this morning. He had it marked. Right on the border of Tibet. Here's where civilization ends. We must be a thousand miles beyond it - just a blank on the map.
What's it mean?
What's it mean?
It means we're in unexplored country - country nobody ever reached.
Hello, George. Cigarette?
Thanks. I suppose all this comes under the heading of adventure.
Thanks. I suppose all this comes under the heading of adventure.
We've had plenty of it the last few days.
We've had plenty of it the last few days.
It's far from over, from what I can see. This place gives me the creeps, hidden away like this - no contact with civilization. Bob, you don't seem concerned at all.

Oh, I'm feeling far too peaceful to be concerned about anything. I think I'm going to like it here.

You talk as though you intend on staying.

Something happened to me, when we arrived here, George, that - well - did you ever go to a totally strange place, and feel certain that you've been there before?

I don't know.

You're a strange bird. No wonder Gainsford calls you the man who always wanted to see what was on the other side of the hill.
Don't you ever want to see what's on the other side of the hill?
What could there be except just another hill? In any event, I'm not curious. At the moment, it seems to me we should be concerned about getting home. I'd give anything to be in London right now.

Of course you would. If ever we get out of this place, the thing for you to do is to take that job with Helen's father.

Well - I mean

What's on your mind, Bob? You talk as though we're going to have trouble getting out of here.
What's on your mind, Bob? You talk as though we're going to have trouble getting out of here.
George, I've been putting things together. Do you notice the resemblance between those natives and the pilot? And why did those clothes materialize so conveniently when they met us at the plane? Chang himself just said that they never venture beyond that point. What brought them there? Unless it was to meet us?

Chang's first question was about the pilot.
Chang's first question was about the pilot.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
There must be some connection between the plane and this place. They must have deliberately brought us here. Why, Bob? What reason could they have for doing a thing like that?

Nothing about the porters yet?

Good heavens, Bob, we've been here two weeks and we haven't found out a thing.

Well, we haven't been murdered in our beds yet, George, have we?
Well, we haven't been murdered in our beds yet, George, have we?
I'm afraid the porters are just a myth. I guess we never will know why we're here, or how long we're going to be held prisoners.

Shhh!
George, what do you think you're doing?
Let me go, Bob!
George, come back!
Chang! Chang! Chang!
Let me up! Let me up!
All right. Sorry, George.
What about the porters?
Porters?
Porters?
Didn't you find out anything about the porters?
Didn't you find out anything about the porters?
Why - I'm sorry - but I
For heaven's sake, Bob, what's the matter with you? You went out there for the purpose of
George. George - do you mind? I'm sorry, but I can't talk about it tonight.
George - you're behaving like a child. You haven't opened your mouth in two weeks.
I don't see that there's anything to say.
I said we're getting out of here. Back to civilization. I made a deal with the porters. They brought in a load of books or something, and they're leaving tomorrow at dawn. They're waiting for us five miles outside the valley. Come on, get your things together. Where's your top coat?
You can't leave, George.
You can't leave, George.
Why not? What's going to stop me?
Why not? What's going to stop me?
You mustn't. You've got to stay here now.
You mustn't. You've got to stay here now.
Stay here?! What's the matter with you, Bob? You've been acting strangely ever since we came here. I've never seen you like this. Why can't we leave? What's stopping us?
Something grand and beautiful, George. Something I've been searching for all my life. The answer to the confusion and bewilderment of a lifetime. I've found it, George, and I can't leave it. You mustn't either.
I don't know what you're talking about. You're carrying around a secret that seems to be eating you up. If you'll only tell me about it.
I don't know what you're talking about. You're carrying around a secret that seems to be eating you up. If you'll only tell me about it.
I will, George. I want to tell you. I'll burst with it if I don't. It's weird and fantastical and sometimes unbelievable, but so beautiful! Well, as you know, we were kidnapped and brought here . . .
Well, I - I really don't know what to say. Except that you must be completely mad.
So you think I'm mad?
So you think I'm mad?
What else can I think after a tale like that? Good heavens, Bob, things like that don't happen today. We're living in the twentieth century.

So you think it's all nonsense, huh?
So you think it's all nonsense, huh?
I think you've been hypnotized by a lot of loose-brained fanatics. Why, I wouldn't believe it if I heard it in an English monastery. Why should I swallow it here in Tibet? How do you know the things they told you are true? Did they show you any proof?

I don't need any proof.
I don't need any proof.
I knew there was a reason I hated this place. I'd give half my life to fly over it with a load of bombs just for what they've done to you. How do you know the things they told you are true? Did they show you any proof? All this talk about the Lamas being hundreds of years old. How do you know? Did

Then you'd better go, George. This is no place for you.
Then you'd better go, George. This is no place for you.
It's no place for you, Bob. Think of what's waiting for you. Do you want to stay here until you're half dead? Until your mind starts corroding like the rest of them?
It's no place for you, Bob. Think of what's waiting for you. Do you want to stay here until you're half dead? Until your mind starts corroding like the rest of them?
Please, George. I don't want to talk about it anymore.
Please, George. I don't want to talk about it anymore.
You've got to talk about it. What about me? You said they stole that plane to bring you here. I didn't want to come. You owe me some responsibility.

It's that girl - that girl has twisted and turned
It's that girl - that girl has twisted and turned
Enough! Never mind the girl! Well, why don't you go?
Look here, Bob, Ever since I can remember, you've looked after me. Now I think you're the one that needs looking after. I'm your brother, Bob. If there's something wrong with you, let me help you.
Oh, George . . .
Oh, George . . .
Besides, I - I don't feel like making that trip alone, Bob.
Besides, I - I don't feel like making that trip alone, Bob.
George, you couldn't possibly stay here, could you?
George, you couldn't possibly stay here, could you?
I'd go mad!
I'd go mad!
George, I may be wrong, I may be a maniac. But I believe in this, and I'm not going to lose it. You know how much I want to help you, but this is bigger, stronger if you like than brotherly love. I'm sorry, George. I'm staying.

Well, I can't think of anything more to say. Goodbye, Bob.
George, are you sure of the porters? About their taking care of you, I mean?
Oh yes. It's all set. Maria made the arrangements.
Oh yes. It's all set. Maria made the arrangements.
Maria?
Maria?
Yes, the little Russian girl.
Yes, the little Russian girl.
What's she got to do with it?
What's she got to do with it?
She's going with me.
You can't take her away from here!
Why not?
Why not?
Because you can't. Do you know what will happen to her if she leaves Shangri-La? She's a fragile thing that can only live where fragile things are loved. Take her out of this valley and she'll fade away like an echo.
Because you can't. Do you know what will happen to her if she leaves Shangri-La? She's a fragile thing that can only live where fragile things are loved. Take her out of this valley and she'll fade away like an echo.
What do you mean - "fade away like an echo"?
What do you mean - "fade away like an echo"?
She came here in 1888!
This would be funny - if it wasn't so pathetic. Why, she isn't a day over twenty!
You're wrong, George.
You're wrong, George.
I'm not wrong. She told me so. Besides, she wouldn't have to tell me. I'd know anyway. I found out a lot of things last night. I'm not ashamed of it either. It's probably one of the few decent things that's ever happened in this hellish place.
So everyone is serenely happy in Shangri-La? Nobody would ever think of leaving? It's all just so much rot! She's pleaded with me ever since I came here to take her away from this awful place. She's cried in my arms for hours, for fear I'd leave her behind. And what's more, she's made two trips to the plateau to bribe the porters -
I don't believe it! I don't believe a word of it!
I don't believe it! I don't believe a word of it!
All right. I'll prove it to you! You believe everything they've told you - without proof! I'll prove my story!
She was kidnapped and brought here two years ago just as we were, Bob.
I don't believe it! I can't believe it. She's lying. You're lying. You're lying! Every word you've been saying is a lie! Come on, say it!
You say the porters are waiting for us?
Yes.
Yes.
The clothes?
The clothes?
Yes, everything!
Yes, everything!
What about the others?
What about the others?
I've already asked them. They're afraid to make the trip. We'll have to send an expedition back after them.
I've already asked them. They're afraid to make the trip. We'll have to send an expedition back after them.
Come on! We're wasting time!
Lucky thing for me you snapped out of it, too. You saved my life. I never could have made it alone.
What was that?
What was that?
was saying
was saying
Can't you shut up? Must you go on babbling like an idiot?
Bob, can't you get them to wait for us? They're leaving us farther behind every day.
There's nothing that would suit them better than to lose us, but we must go on. Come on.
Target practice again! One of these days they're going to hit us.
As long as they keep on aiming at us, we're safe. Come now, child.
Where did you come from?
I'm Alexander P. Lovett, sir.
I'm Alexander P. Lovett, sir.
Why aren't you registered through our office?
Where were you hiding?
Hiding? Oh, no. Hunting - I was in the interior - hunting fossils. This morning I looked up suddenly
Hiding? Oh, no. Hunting - I was in the interior - hunting fossils. This morning I looked up suddenly
I know - and a war broke out right over your head.
No. That's not possible! If we had landed, we all would have been awakened.
Of course. We never left the air. I know - I didn't sleep the whole night long.
Of course. We never left the air. I know - I didn't sleep the whole night long.
That fellow got on at Baskul.
That fellow got on at Baskul.
What's he doing? Where's he taking us? He may be a maniac for all we know.
Good.
What if he refuses?
What if he refuses?
We'll smash his face in. That's what we'll do.
We'll smash his face in. That's what we'll do.
Brilliant! Can anyone here fly a plane?
I guess we're in for it.
In for what?
In for what?
I don't know. He must have had some purpose in taking the plane away from Fenner. When he lands, we'll find out.
I don't know. He must have had some purpose in taking the plane away from Fenner. When he lands, we'll find out.
You mean to tell me you're not going to do anything until we land?
You mean to tell me you're not going to do anything until we land?
What do you suggest?
What do you suggest?
Why, you - you Look here - he may dash us to pieces!
Why, you - you Look here - he may dash us to pieces!
It might afford you a great deal of relief. Now gentlemen, I'm going back to sleep. Oh, and I was having such a peaceful dream. As soon as he lands, let me know.
Imagine having all that fuel there, waiting for us! George, something tells me our journey is just beginning.
Where are we going? Huh?
Huh? I give it up. But this not knowing where you're going is exciting anyway.
Well, Mr. Conway, for a man who is supposed to be a leader, your do- nothing attitude is very disappointing.
At the mercy of a mad pilot.
We'd be eternally grateful if you
Oh, please. I hope you're not going to run away this time.
My name's Sondra.
My name's Sondra.
hope you'll forgive me for
You know, each time I see you, I hear that music. What is it?
Oh, you mean my pigeons.
Was this your idea?
Yes. Hold this pigeon.
Yes. Hold this pigeon.
You suggested my being brought here, didn't you? What gave you the idea I'd fit in?
You suggested my being brought here, didn't you? What gave you the idea I'd fit in?
That was easy. I read your books.
That was easy. I read your books.
Oh, you've read my books. You do more things! What have my books got to do with it?
Oh, you've read my books. You do more things! What have my books got to do with it?
I saw a man whose life was empty.
I saw a man whose life was empty.
A man whose life was empty!
A man whose life was empty!
Oh, I know. It was full of this and full of that. But you were accomplishing nothing. You were going nowhere, and you knew it.
As a matter of fact, all I saw was a little boy whistling in the dark.
A little boy whistling in the dark!? Do you realize that there is a British cruiser waiting at Shanghai, smoke pouring out of its funnels, tugging at its moorings, waiting to take Mr. Conway back to London? Do you know that at this minute there are headlines shrieking all over the world the news that Conway is missing? Does that look like a man

Yes.
Yes.
You're absolutely right. And I had to come all the way to a pigeon house in Shangri-La to find the only other person in the world who knew it. May I congratulate you?
I really only brought you here to show you my pigeons!
Don't worry about the pigeons. From now on, you can put flutes on my tail and bells on my feet!
There are so many questions I'd like to ask you, I hardly know where to begin.
I'll help you. To begin with, you'd like to know what I'm doing here. Whether I was born here.
I'll help you. To begin with, you'd like to know what I'm doing here. Whether I was born here.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Well, I was almost born here. It took place in that wild country beyond the pass. My father and mother were in a party of explorers who got lost and wandered around for a year. When Chang found us, only Father and I were alive. But he was too weak to climb the pass. He died on the way. I was brought up here

Father Perrault! I envy you. I talked to him last night.
Father Perrault! I envy you. I talked to him last night.
Yes, I know.
Yes, I know.
Father Perrault. Of course I can't quite get used to this age thing.
I'm thirty.
Oh, you're going to make life very simple.
What is?
All of it. Father Perrault and his magnificent history. This place, hidden away from the rest of the world, with its glorious concepts, and now you come along and confuse me entirely.

I'm sorry. I thought I was to be the light. But why do I confuse you? Am I so strange?
I'm sorry. I thought I was to be the light. But why do I confuse you? Am I so strange?
On the contrary, you're not strange. And that in itself is confusing. I have the same idea about Shangri- La. The sense that I've been here before, that I belong here.

I'm so glad.
I'm so glad.
I can't quite explain it, but everything is somehow familiar. The very air that I breathe. The Lamasery, with its feet rooted in the good earth of this fertile valley, while its head explores the eternal. All the beautiful things I see, these cherry blossoms, you - all somehow familiar. I've been kidnapped and brought here against my will. A crime, a great crime,

I wonder.
I wonder.
I'm sure of it. Just as I'm sure there's a wish for Shangri-La in everyone's heart. I have never seen the outside world. But I understand there are millions and millions of people who are supposed to be mean and greedy. Yet I just know that secretly they are all hoping to find a garden spot where there is peace and security, where there's

Then it wouldn't be a garden spot for long.
Beautiful! I'm waiting for the bump.
Bump?
Bump?
When the plane lands at Shangri-La and wakes us all up.
Ouch!
You see, it's not a dream.
You see, it's not a dream.
You know, sometimes I think that it's the other that's the dream. The outside world. Have you never wanted to go there?

Goodness, no. From what you tell me about it, it certainly doesn't sound very attractive.

It's the most annoying word in the English language. Did you ever hear a child torture his parent with it? Mother's little darling musn't stick her fingers in the salad bowl. Why? Because it isn't lady- like to do that. Why? Because that's what forks are made for, darling.

Why, mother?
Why, mother?
Because mother read it in a book somewhere, and if mother's little darling doesn't take her fingers out of the salad bowl this instant, mother's going to wring her little neck.
Would you like to wring my little neck?
I'd love it!
I'd love it!
Why?
I've thought about it for years. I knew you'd come. And I knew if you did - you'd never leave. Am I forgiven for sending for you?
Forgiven. You know, when we were on that plane, I was fascinated by the way its shadow followed it. That silly shadow racing along over mountains and valleys, covering ten times the distance of the plane. It was always there to greet us with outstretched arms when we landed. And I've been thinking that somehow you're that plane, and I'm that silly shadow. That
It would serve you right if you were left behind.
How could I know that a war was going to break out right over my head! Right over my head. Oh, my word! I tell you, those Chinese were pouncing on me from every direction. I had to get into these ridiculous clothes in order to escape.
Couldn't you arrange to make a little less noise?
I tell you, we're going west, and Shanghai is east of here!

It's Fenner.
What do you want him to do?
I don't know. I'm a paleontologist, not a Foreign Secretary.
What is it?
Mountain grass. It's good, too. Here, have some. I've read of people lasting thirty days on this stuff.
Why, he's speaking English.
English!
Now that dinner is over, if you'll excuse us, we're very anxious to discuss ways and means of getting back home.
The first thing we want to do is to cable the Foreign Office. All of England is waiting to hear about my brother. There's a cruiser at Shanghai ready to take him back.
That's what I mean - mysterious. Mr. Conway, I don't like that man. He's too vague.
We didn't get much information out of him, did we Bob?
How about you? Do you want to go?
Go? Where?
Go? Where?
Home. Away from here. I've got porters to take us back.

You'll tell me some of the things I want to know, won't you? You'll tell me who runs this place. And why we were kidnapped. And what they're going to do with us!
The hell happened?
Hesitated, sir.
Hesitated, sir.
I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about your choice of targets.
You shot an eight year old girl.
Uh... yes. Apparently I did, air.

Sir, before you boot me, I just want to explain. I mean, okay, you got a goat-guy with a hook for a head...
Cowan--
Cowan--
Wait. Uh-- sir. Please. Anyway. Hook-head-guy. I'm thinking "how can he think with a hook for a head?" Answer: that's not his head. Then I think--

Cowan-- will you shut your god damed mouth?
Yes. That's true. Actually, at this point, I just want A job. Wait. What do you mean... yet?
It means I know you think you got a beat on things. But trust me, you don't. You don't even have an inkling of a hint of a clue as to what's really going on in the world. And if you want to find out even a little, you'll shut up and come with me. And if you don't, fine. Go with them. Cause
So... this door. It's... not an exit... ?

I gotta be honest about something.
Once I thought the biggest thing I'll ever do was guard the president.
Oh, you'll still, be guarding him.
It's easy. You work your way up the secret service, one day stand with the President, meet the most important people on the planet, fulfill your dreams, live happily ever after.
And if I say yes?
And if I say yes?
Lose your name and identity, work endless hours an behalf people who don't know you exist, and abandon any hope that you might one day feel even the slightest bit sure of your place in the universe.
... think that maybe my supervisors referred me here because of certain issues which I assure you I have spent a good deal of time working very hard to correct--
Your supervisors have no idea why you're here.
Your supervisors have no idea why you're here.
They don't?
They don't?
They don't. Now, son. If you get the job, you're going to be working with some very particular people who like to do things in some very particular ways. Here's a little piece of advice: Don't use this so much.
What's so funny, cadet Cowan?
I... I don't know, air. This guy. Mr. "Best of the best of the best... " I don't know. It's just still find it a little... humorous. I'm sorry. Sir.
Well... you know, when you say "normal," what, exactly...
For instance... It says here you lost your parents at 15, and, since then...

Sir. I thought those records were sealed.
Sir. I thought those records were sealed.
We're the government, Cowan.
You think we're nuts.
No-- it makes sense. Cause I gotta tell ya, when I was in third grade they told me I was crazy cause I swore that our teacher was from, like, Venus or something.

Mrs. Edelson?
Only the damn guy won't know it.
What happens if I say no?
From now on, you'll respond only to the name "Jay." You'll dress in appropriate attire specially sanctioned by the INS Special Services. You're not to stand out in any way. Understand?
Yes, sir.
Everybody, listen up: we've had a tremendous amount of movement lately. Be aware. Be safe. Have a good day. Oh, uh... Cowan?
Yes, air? -- OOOMPH.
Hell of an assistant, isn't he? Damn guy moves so fast, he actually gets there before you even ask for him.
Sorta literally gets ahead of himself.

Hang on. -- And this is the good part; when you're fully ordained, he'll come when you call him, too. Dave.
So... wait. You just asked... but he goes so fast, he actually brought what you asked for before you asked for it.

No. But You'll get used to it. Welcome to the Men in Black.
Sorry, Cowan, I found out literally just before the ceremony.' Apparently you're to report for further review.
Further... what are you talking about, air? That makes no sense-- I hold three cadet class records--
Further... what are you talking about, air? That makes no sense-- I hold three cadet class records--
Actually, it didn't come from me.
Bull... loney- Sir. I'm sorry. Sir, I'm sorry. Sir. I just, I find it hard to believe that it didn't come from you. I mean, everything here comes from you.
Well this didn't.
Well this didn't.
Then where did it-- ? Sir. Forgive me, but it makes no sense. worked my ass off to grad--
Look. I don't know why. I could guess, however. Maybe it's your attitude. Or that you're not even close to a team player. Or that you always seen to think you know more than your supervisors.
Actually, sir--
Actually, sir--
Cowan. Do you ever think that maybe, just maybe, other people might be right and you might be wrong?
Cowan. Do you ever think that maybe, just maybe, other people might be right and you might be wrong?

This is a neurelyser. it was a gift from some friends from out of town. I need you to look at it. This red eye here isolates and measures the nature of the electronic impulses currently in your brain. More specifically, the ones -for memory, which it will then block.

Why? What are you gonna do?
Why? What are you gonna do?
Actually that's a very good question. The answer-- if You'll Just look at this Part-- is here.

Well, how about if I guess, then? Black: Vast space. Deep. Spiritual. The essence of infinity.
We wear black.
We wear black.
Oh. Right. I guess that's kind of cool, too, in it's own way. Course, this isn't really black; it's kind of a dull, dirty, tarry sort of noncolor, isn't it?
The point is to not call attention to ourselves.
I understand. Hey, it works for the Hasids, right? No one recognizes them.
It's a bug.
Right.
Right.
But not a BUG bug-- it's an insect.
So... lemme get this straight. We got the use of all sorts of technology from all sorts of other planets. We got information no one else in the world is privy to. And we're in a 1986 Ford LTD about to go look at an insect?
So what's the problem?
So what's the problem?
Well, first of all... I gotta think we could still blend in pretty nice in a Ferrari Testerrosa. I mean, there is a lot of `em on the street these days, and... uh...
I tell you, if we really wanted to bland in, that'd what we'd be wearing. I think it'd be a good look for you, too. I'll even help you choose a tattoo.

It's an Edna named after Zed's ex wife. All you do is at the target. The scope matches the image with the image on your retina. The barrel will find the target on its own.

History's proven that where there's a nitrogenizer, there's a 12-legged signazoid. They use it to make our food digestible for their systems.

What if he's telling the truth?
What if he's telling the truth?
You know something? I actually never think of that. I gotta get some coffee.
Kay--
Hang on. There's gotta be something on this guy. Did you contact the Alliance? Do they have anything?
He's here to help!?
Yes. Well, in his own mind, yeah. What if, from his point of view, he is?
Yes. Well, in his own mind, yeah. What if, from his point of view, he is?
How does that help me?

Well... if you think about it, then it would mean that maybe everything he's saying is true.
Great. Fine. Listen, why don't we call the pentagon, maybe they'll take you back with the new age well wishers. I'll stay here and go extinct with the dinosaurs.

Cause I've been doing this thirty years and if I don't know when something doesn't feel right by now--
That's my point. For thirty years you've been looking through things and under things and behind things. Well what I'm saying is maybe this is a time where you should look right at things. He said our enemy in already here. Well maybe it is. Maybe our enemy is, literally, already here.
What are you doing?
Everything left the planet, right? Except one thing. That little insect-- the one we found in Sudbury. Did it leave when everything else left?
Since how long?
Since as long as we've been keeping records...
Maybe they didn't get here. Maybe they've been here.
For how long?
We saw it in the office. It went from this big... to big... in a day.
Well, if the bugs have hatched, and they're not here... then where are they?
It's marble.
All of it?
Would you call this a code 100?
I'd double it and add 20.
I'm going to try and cut him off at the hotel. You guys get to the Memorial. Keep this stuff hidden. The last thing we need is some over-zealous Secret Service twirp to...
Do his job.

Sure.
Me, too. I feel a long day coming on.
I put word out-- you know how long it takes to get the signals across.
Kay. Seriously. What if he actually means what he says?
So, I guess you could say you're really into insects...
Actually, they disgust me. But that's what I love about them. Like a car wrack, you know, how you shouldn't look, but you always pull over and watch real close, or even pretend you're a reporter so you can get even closer and take pictures?
Or when someone has a hideous birthmark and all you do is stare. I really like that. Let the other girls have the guys like you. Chiseled jaw, perfect nose, quirky dimples. I find you all so boring.
I'd prefer if you were just a little more blunt.
So... how'd you hear about this?
Oh, yeah, well, you know. I'm a big fan. I've read all your work.
Oh, yeah, well, you know. I'm a big fan. I've read all your work.
Yeah, right. Even I can barely read all my work.
Right, right-- I like that stuff.
With exclusionary frecto-inhibitors?
With exclusionary frecto-inhibitors?
Exactly. I very much enjoy that.
Exactly. I very much enjoy that.
Do have any idea what I just said?
Once-- just once-- I thought I'd made the discovery of a lifetime...
Actually, you may have.
It's hard to find. It's an old civil war cemetery. Nobody ever goes there. So... what is it you say you do?
I guess you could say we're entopologists of a sort.
I guess you could say we're entopologists of a sort.
I don't think so. I mean, him, he could be a scientist, maybe. But you... Exterminator, I'd understand. But entopolgist? No way.
I don't think so. I mean, him, he could be a scientist, maybe. But you... Exterminator, I'd understand. But entopolgist? No way.
Why not?
Why not?
Well, first of all, it's entomologist.
I swear to God, that was not here two days ago...
What is it?
What is it?
It's the most amazing insect nest I've ever seen. And I'll tell you one thing, it sure as hell ain't the Andean Mollatoosa.
It's the most amazing insect nest I've ever seen. And I'll tell you one thing, it sure as hell ain't the Andean Mollatoosa.
But it's definitely a nest, isn't it?
But it's definitely a nest, isn't it?
Man, hey-- maybe you are an entopologist after all.
When?
It would've had to have been recently-- within a few weeks.
It would've had to have been recently-- within a few weeks.
So... how did they get here?
What do we do?
What do we do? Lean into it.
What do we do? Lean into it.
What the hell does that mean?
What the hell does that mean?
Actually... I don't know.
Is it my eyes... or is that thing a little...
Out of focus?
Okay. If you've got a bug problem-a big one. And they're swarming and there's no way to shoot them all individually... how do you get rid of them?
The only thing I could think of would be... you'd have to get rid of the queen.
The only thing I could think of would be... you'd have to get rid of the queen.
What if you have the foggiest clue as to where the queen is?
What if you have the foggiest clue as to where the queen is?
Are you sure you don't?
What are you doing?
They respond to fear, right?
They respond to fear, right?
Yeah ... ?
Yeah ... ?
Well I'm going to give them something to be afraid of.
What a coincidence, cause I was just thinking about you, too, Jack. Recognize this?
No.
No.
Maybe you need a closer look.
The kid looked desperate. I figured...
You figured what?
You figured what?
I figured it didn't matter. It's my last day of business. I was wrong. I'm sorry. Hey, look what I got for you-- a free-floating plasma pad? --One of the good ones, too, with zoids.
Your licence is revoked. Permanently.
I understand. I understand, thank you. --How about a transmographic dexahydrochlorophallomixaloosalyser?
And I'm arranging deportation papers.
Yes. Yes, that's eminently fair of you.
Yes. Yes, that's eminently fair of you.
And I'm bringing you in and locking you up until you tell me--
Let's go, Jeebs. Downtown.
You're not taking me in!
Pardon me. I hate to break up this lovely little group hug, but we people aren't ready for what we have. How is this going to help?
How could it not?
How could it not?
Why don't you ask the Mosebacke? Brazil. Until 44 years ago they ate with their hands, lived in huts, and didn't even know the rest of the world existed. 44 years ago a well intentioned missionary gave them a fork. Today, they don't exist.

Come on now. People are smart.
Come on now. People are smart.
No-- a Person is smart. People are dumb. And the more people you put together, the dumber they get. And you know that.
Not bad. Briliiant, actually. You come unarmed, and alone. Cause your army's been growing underground for what? 100 years? 150?
Give or take. It was right around your civil war, I think, when I was here last. We were waiting till your planet was warm enough.
Goodwill...
Most entirely. Earth has been overrun with an infestation of a species which, in order for the planet to survive, must be exterminated.
Nowhere.
Nowhere, huh? odd you'd get all dressed up like that just to be going nowhere.
Er. well, nowhere special.
I don't believe you, Mikey. And you know why I don't believe you? Cause last time you said that you and your pals left eight dozen empty beer cans on the other side of the moon.
I don't believe you, Mikey. And you know why I don't believe you? Cause last time you said that you and your pals left eight dozen empty beer cans on the other side of the moon.
Yeah, wall, you know, I was just going there... to pick then up.
Oh yeah? Well if you're suddenly such a good samaritan, why didn't you file a departure report, like you're supposed to? You know how many rules you've just broken?
I dunno. One?
I dunno. One?
Try seven. From unauthorized mobilization to appearing unconcealed before a resident. You wanna tell me what's going on? Huh?
Try seven. From unauthorized mobilization to appearing unconcealed before a resident. You wanna tell me what's going on? Huh?
It's... coming.
It's... coming.
What are you talking about, it's coming? What's coming?
So... now what? Cattle call again?
We've got about eight or nine prospects I want you look--
We've got about eight or nine prospects I want you look--
Yeah, I'll talk to you.
... recent landings within a hundred mile radius of Sudbury, Virginia?
Nothing.
Nothing.
Nothing at all? Now? Last month? Anything in the last few years?
Nothing at all? Now? Last month? Anything in the last few years?
Nope. Nothing at all.
I know what this is. Zed, you in?
Yeah, Kay?
Yeah, Kay?
Did our friend announce when he's making his speech?
Did our friend announce when he's making his speech?
Noon exactly.
Noon exactly.
Did he say where?
Did he say where?
Actually, yeah--
Actually, yeah--
Wouldn't happen to be the Lincoln Memorial, would it?
Wouldn't happen to be the Lincoln Memorial, would it?
How'd you know that? Kay?
How'd you know that? Kay?
Cause I think we're looking at it.
Listen to me. You're holding something very very dangerous. You've just iced 350 of your pals--
They're not my pals--
They're not my pals--
They're not even gonna be your enemie-a if you don't give that to me really soon.
They're not even gonna be your enemie-a if you don't give that to me really soon.
What if I don't?
What if I don't?
In about 10 seconds they're gonna start losing brain cells at the rate of about a million a minute.

Will it lower the curve?

I don't think it's a tradeoff you really want to make. Now give it to me-- I can reverse the effects if you give it to me now.
I don't think it's a tradeoff you really want to make. Now give it to me-- I can reverse the effects if you give it to me now.
I wanna make a deal.
Found it.
Tell us the truth. You don't just find these things, at least not in this neighborhood.
Tell us the truth. You don't just find these things, at least not in this neighborhood.
I promised I wouldn't tell.
I just wanted to scare em. So I go in to buy a starter's pistol-- you know, the kind they use at track meets that shoot blanks-- and this guy, he said if I really wanted to mess with with them, he had just the thing...
This guy. Where was he?
We're from Scientific American. We read about your discovery. We'd like to take a look.
Scientific American? Really?
This it?
Yeah. Nov I know it looks normal, but watch this.
I mean, I dunno. I've seen insects with really great camoflauge ability. But never like this.
May I have a look?
We're with the immigration and Naturalization Service, Intergalactic Bureau. We monitor all-alien activity in and around Earth and its enveloping atmosphere.
Come again?
Hmnn... wall, it's funny, cause usually I'm not all that attracted to stupid guys, but--
But, unfortunately, you're even less attracted to guys you've never seen before.
We need to talk to you about the alien.
The what?
Which way?
Seriously. I'm not going any further until you tell who you are.
Really nice wheels, by the way.
Wait-- listen--
How's Dee?
Fine. Good.
Jupiter, actually. well, one of the moons.
So whattya say, kid? You in or out?
Kay? What's your 20?
Highway 119, just west of Smith. Why?
Highway 119, just west of Smith. Why?
I need you in Philadelphia. I got a code 90, in a-high school.
I need you in Philadelphia. I got a code 90, in a-high school.
What the hell is going on?
He's gone, too.
What about the other agents? Ella? Tee?
What about the other agents? Ella? Tee?
Elle's up in Portland-- three of her charges left visibly at a Trailblazers game. Shots got a lot to mop up. Tee says his Shanghai quadrasectionals haven't been around since morning.
Even that little bug you found in Sudbury seems to have taken off.
Jesus, everyone's moving. Could be an assembly. Does it look aggressive?
Jesus, everyone's moving. Could be an assembly. Does it look aggressive?
Hard to tell. I hope not.
Hard to tell. I hope not.
Keep an eye on things there. We'll see what we can find out at Ernie Goosels.
They're gone.
Dee? What are you doing here?
I'm getting a trajectory...
What do we have? Are we showing anything?
And they're buying it?
They went right to the President.
They went right to the President.
They went to the President? Directly? THEY WENT OVER OUR HEADS?
As far as I can tell, the guy's what he says he is - alone, and unarmed. All he wants is five minutes to introduce himself to the public.
Where's he making his big speech?
Where's he making his big speech?
They haven't announced it yet. All I know is we're in motion for the most watched media event in history.
Well, it wasn't in the jar...
Did it leave?
Did it leave?
Actually, I don't know...
Actually, I don't know...
Oh shit!
Yeah? What's up?
I got a planet check on that bug. It's from way the hell out in the third belt. it's organic, formed in the same blast that made our solar system.
And get this: you know how humans evolved from primates? Well guess what the dominant life form on planet evolved from?
Don't tell me. Insects.
How'd you know?
Just a guess. But I think found a nest.
Now, what are we looking at? Keys. Look at them all. Why do we have them? Mr. President?
Well, uh... so we can got into things, I guess.
Well, uh... so we can got into things, I guess.
That's why you have doors, Mr. President. Keys, however, are to lock the doors. And locks, as you know, are to keep people out. Why? Fear. You humans are afraid. So you set up boundaries. Borders. Your car. Your home. Your country. All the while your true enemy could very well be considered already here among you. Well I am here to let that
Why, you might ask? Because you're ready. Because you've finally gone as far as you can go without it.
If I may, sir... what exactly are you offering?
If I may, sir... what exactly are you offering?
A good question. And a simple answer. No more hunger. No more smog. No more overpopulation. No more war.
A good question. And a simple answer. No more hunger. No more smog. No more overpopulation. No more war.
And I assume you're bringing this to us because we're the most powerful country on the planet...
And I assume you're bringing this to us because we're the most powerful country on the planet...
That and, well... I want my friends to see me on CNN. Okay, I will admit it: ours is an illegal hookup. We'll gladly pay when you can get your trucks out to install it.
Wally!
Can you see?
I'm sorry, but I need your help. You contain information. I need to know how to get it. Can you just tell me who Leo Crow is? Can you tell me if --
Is it now?
Is it now?
What?
What?
Is it now?
What?
They're inside.
They're inside.
Who?
Take it.
Agatha...
Agatha --
Can you see the balloon man?
Can you see the balloon man?
What?
Drop some money.
Forget that guy --
Forget that guy --
Do it. Right here. On the ground.
No. Follow him.
He'll turn around.
He'll turn around.
He won't.
Agatha...
Wait.
He's here.
Anderton, leave.
I can't. I have to know.
Please --
Please --
I have to find out what happened to my life. Agatha. I'm not going to kill the man. I don't even know him.
Oh, God...
What is it?
Every day for the last six years I've thought about only two things. The first was what my son would look like if he were alive today. If I would even recognize him if I saw him on the street. The second was what I would do to the man who took him.
Anderton --
Anderton --
You were right. I'm not being set up.
Please, I want to go back...
I can't leave. You said so yourself, there is no Minority Report. I don't have an alternative future.
I can't leave. You said so yourself, there is no Minority Report. I don't have an alternative future.
But you still have a choice. The others never had a chance to see their future. You did.
Where are we going?
Someplace safe.
Someplace safe.
I have to go back.
I have to go back.
Why?
Why?
The other two will die without me.
The other two will die without me.
You want to spend the rest of your life in the temple?
I always wondered what the world would be like. But now that I've seen it, I don't need to see any more. It's all right. Once I'm in the tank, I won't remember any of this.
Agatha, you're never going back there.
Agatha, you're never going back there.
I am going back. I see myself there.
Can't you see? She just wanted her little girl back.
Who wanted her little girl back?
Who wanted her little girl back?
The drowning woman. Anne... But it was too late. Her little girl was already gone.
The drowning woman. Anne... But it was too late. Her little girl was already gone.
She died?
She died?
She grew up.
She grew up.
She's still alive?
She's not alive, but she didn't die.
Oh, Jesus...
I'm sorry, John, but you have to run again.
What --
What --
RUN!
-- but he didn't.
Then who was he?
Then who was he?
Just some guy... they found.
Just some guy... they found.
Found? Where?
Found? Where?
Somewhere.
Think, John. Why would they set you up?
Because I found out about her...
Because I found out about her...
About who?
About who?
Anne Lively...
I'm so sorry... I just want him back... I want him back so bad...
I know... I do, too...
John? What is it?
How did I not see this? Agatha, who killed you mother? Who killed Anne Lively?
Don't worry. I could cut open your chest, sew a dead cat in there and you'd never get an infection. Not with the spectrum of antibios I'll be shooting into you.
That's comforting.
That's comforting.
You do understand I can't just give you new irises. The scanners will read the scar tissue. Alarms will go off. Large men with guns will appear...
You do understand I can't just give you new irises. The scanners will read the scar tissue. Alarms will go off. Large men with guns will appear...
Right. I know --
Anesthesia. Try to relax, John. I'm saying I'll have to remove your eyes. Completely.
Yeah --
Yeah --
And replace them with new ones.
And replace them with new ones.
I know that, but I wanna keep the old ones.
I know that, but I wanna keep the old ones.
Why?
Why?
Because my mother gave them to me. What do you care? They're no good to you on the secondary market anyway.
Because my mother gave them to me. What do you care? They're no good to you on the secondary market anyway.
Whatever you say, John.
That's not much.
It's all I could safely move.
It's all I could safely move.
Tell you what, since you and I go way back, I'll give you my Old Pal discount. How's that sound?
You don't remember me, do you?
We know each other?
We know each other?
Oh, yes.
From where? D.C.?
Baltimore. Eastside. Solomon P. Eddie M.D. I was a plastic surgeon.
I put you away --
Yes, you did.
Yes, you did.
You made those tapes...
You made those tapes...
They were performance pieces.
They were performance pieces.
You set your patients on fire!
You set your patients on fire!
And put them out. Some not as quickly as others, but let's change the subject, shall we? The future is much more interesting than the past. Don't you think?
So uh, if you were a plastic surgeon before...
How can I do what I do now? Let's just say I spent a lot of time in the prison library.
There's food in the refrigerator. Make sure you drink a lot of water.
How do I find the --
How do I find the --
Here --
It goes from the bathroom to the kitchen.
I can't even stand up --
I can't even stand up --
I know you're in a hurry, so I juiced up the nano-reconstruction around your new eyes.
I know you're in a hurry, so I juiced up the nano-reconstruction around your new eyes.
The nano... what?
The nano... what?
Organic microbots that reconstruct the nerves and blood vessels. It'll feel like fleas chewing on your eyeballs. But whatever you do, don't scratch.
I'm setting up a timer. When it goes off tomorrow, take off your bandages and get the hell out of here. But not before then, or you'll --
-- go blind. I know.
You the sentry?
Yes, sir. I'm Gideon. The music relaxes the prisoners.
I don't ever see any of you precops down here, I'm not in trouble am I?
No, you're not in trouble. I'm interested in a murder.
No, you're not in trouble. I'm interested in a murder.
Kill type?
Kill type?
Drowning.
Victim's a white female.
This about the Justice Department? They laid on a tour for tomorrow a.m. Told me to wear a tie. You like this one?
That's an old one. One of our first.
This is the official composite of the three precogs?
This is the official composite of the three precogs?
That's right. It's a combined data stream based on all three previsions.
That's right. It's a combined data stream based on all three previsions.
Show me just Agatha's data stream.
Show me just Agatha's data stream.
For that, we have to go for a ride.
You the only sentry?
I work graveyard, swing and day all by my lonesome.
Hence the expression...
... Graveyard shift.
... Graveyard shift.
Not to mention, "Saved by the bell".
Why's he still a John Doe? Why wasn't he ever ID's from an EYEscan?
On account of those are not his eyes. He had 'em swapped out to fool the scanners.
Huh, we don't seem to have her data.
Try again.
Try again.
No... we have the two previsions from the twins right here, but... ... I can't pull up any data from the female. Probably just a glitch.
Hey, you wanna know where the word came from, "glitch?"
Just tell me about the intended victim. This Anne Lively...
Looks like she was a neuroin addict like John Doe here, but I show an address history that includes the Beaton Clinic.
So she cleaned up. Where is she now?
You're part of my flock now, John. Welcome.
Lara --
Lara --
It's actually kind of a rush. They say you get visions; that your life flashes before your eyes. That all your dreams come true.
Tell me not to worry, John.
Don't worry, Lamar.
Don't worry, Lamar.
The nation votes this week...
Which makes this the worst possible time to show that we're only human.
Uh-huh...
Uh-huh...
Has the observer from Justice shown up yet?
Has the observer from Justice shown up yet?
Hang on, Lamar --
And this is exactly the kind of behavior that will give them an excuse to do it.
Lamar, I'm sorry. I don't know what --
Lamar, I'm sorry. I don't know what --
Don't apologize, John.
You understand that a week from now people are going to vote on whether or not what we've been doing down here has been some noble-minded enterprise or a chance to change the way this country fights crime.
I understand. Sir.
I need you to do two things for me. One, watch Danny Witwer.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
You can let him look around, answer his questions, but watch him. If there's any problems, make sure we know about it first.
You can let him look around, answer his questions, but watch him. If there's any problems, make sure we know about it first.
I understand. What's the other thing?
I understand. What's the other thing?
Tuck in your shirt.
And you say the third prevision was, what, a little fuzzy or something?
I'm saying the third prevision wasn't there. And that's not all. I spent a few hours down there and it turns out there's a dozen more cases with missing previsions.
Danny Witwer is scheduled for a tour of Containment tomorrow --
So give him a tour. He doesn't know enough to ask the right questions.
So give him a tour. He doesn't know enough to ask the right questions.
If he's looking for a flaw in the system --
If he's looking for a flaw in the system --
He's not. He's looking for a flaw in us, John.
Lara called me.
What?
What?
She's worried about you. And, quite frankly, so am I.
She's worried about you. And, quite frankly, so am I.
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
I hear you've been spending a lot of time in the sprawl.
I hear you've been spending a lot of time in the sprawl.
I go running down there.
I go running down there.
In the middle of the night?
What if Danny Witwer came to you right now and insisted on a full chem run?
I'm fine, Lamar.
You understand, John, that the minute Precrime goes national, they're going to take it away from us.
We won't let them.
We won't let them.
No? How's an old man and a cop on the whiff ever going to stop them?
Just so you know, I've overridden the vehicle locator. I just wanted to talk to you before Justice --
Justice already knows. Talk to me, John. Tell me what's happening?
Justice already knows. Talk to me, John. Tell me what's happening?
This is all Witwer. He's setting me up.
This is all Witwer. He's setting me up.
Stop. Just wait. Who's the victim?
Stop. Just wait. Who's the victim?
Somebody named Leo Crow.
Somebody named Leo Crow.
And who the hell is that?
And who the hell is that?
I have no idea. I've never heard of him. But I'm supposed to kill him in less than thirty-six hours.
I have no idea. I've never heard of him. But I'm supposed to kill him in less than thirty-six hours.
All right, John, just take a breath, let's think about this...
All right, John, just take a breath, let's think about this...
I'm out of breath! I'm a fucking fugitive!
I'm out of breath! I'm a fucking fugitive!
Then come to my house. We'll talk --
Then come to my house. We'll talk --
I can't. They're following me right now. They'll meet me there. They'll halo me.
I can't. They're following me right now. They'll meet me there. They'll halo me.
How could Witwer have accessed the case file?
How could Witwer have accessed the case file?
Can you fake the cerebral output?

We're years from that. John, I'm asking you: please, come in, we'll shut down the system until we get this thing figured out.
We're years from that. John, I'm asking you: please, come in, we'll shut down the system until we get this thing figured out.
You know I can't do that. You can't do that... Lamar, I need you to talk to Wally, see if Witwer's gone inside the temple again. Then ask Jad for any off hour EYEdents into the analytical room --
You know I can't do that. You can't do that... Lamar, I need you to talk to Wally, see if Witwer's gone inside the temple again. Then ask Jad for any off hour EYEdents into the analytical room --
John. Just tell me, who's Leo Crow?
John. Please. Listen to me --
I'm not getting halo'd.
I'm not getting halo'd.
You can't run --
You can't run --
Everybody runs.
John --
I just wanted to congratulate you. You did it. You've created a world without murder. So what if you had to kill someone to do it.
People want to believe in the system. That's the beauty of it...
Beauty? The precogs don't even always agree with each other!
No doubt the Precogs have already seen this.
No doubt.
No doubt.
Then go ahead, pull the trigger.
Seventeen minutes.
Armor up -- sick-sticks and concussion guns -- this is gonna be close.
Chief, the investigator from the Fed is here.
You're kidding, that's today?
You're kidding, that's today?
I wrote it down in your calendar, then left a message at your house --

Uh, sir...
Get him some coffee and tell him to wait outside.
What he's doing now, we call "scrubbing the image", looking for clues as to where the murder's going to happen.

I show a cop on horseback.
Don't run, Chief. You know we'll catch you. You trained us.
Everybody runs.
Everybody runs.
You don't have to do this, Chief.
You don't have to do this, Chief.
You don't have to chase me, Fletcher.
Okay, Jad, what's coming?
Red Ball -- double homicide: one male, one female. Killer's male, white, 40's.
We need confirmation on the time frame. Location still uncertain. Remote witnesses are hooked in...
Case #1108, previsualized by the Precogs and recorded on holoshpere by Precrime's q-stacks. My fellow witnesses for case #1108 are Dr. Katherine James and Chief Justice Frank Pollard.
We can't grab it...
Run the subscription list...
Got him in the Foxhall. 4421 Gainsborough.

Nope. Somebody's thinking about this one.

Amazing there's someone within two hundred miles actually dumb enough to still do that.
The victim's name is Leo Crow.
Start a location run and a contact search for future victim Leo Crow. And, Jad, I'll need a Last Known Sheet when you get it.

I'm sorry Danny, but I'll have to give you the full tour later on.
Your secretaries were all kind enough to give me a look around the office...
As I recall, they outlawed compression firearms in the District ten years ago.
They did. Make yourself comfortable. We'll be back in an hour.
They did. Make yourself comfortable. We'll be back in an hour.
You mind if I tag along?
But it's not the future if you stop it. Isn't that a fundamental paradox?
Yes, it is.
Why did you catch that?
Because it was going to fall.
Because it was going to fall.
You're certain?
You're certain?
Yes.
Yes.
But it didn't fall. You caught it.
The fact that you prevented it from happening doesn't change the fact that it was going to happen.
You ever get any false positives? Someone intends to kill his boss or his wife, but they never go through with it. How do the precogs tell the difference?

Why don't you cut the cute act, Danny, and tell me exactly what it is you're looking for?

I agree. The system is perfect. If there's a flaw, it's human. It always is. Thank you for the tour, Wally.
You set me up...
I'll write the paranoia off to the whiff you been doping on all night.
It seems I've found a flaw, John You.
You gonna tell on me?
You gonna tell on me?
Possession alone will cost you six months, not to mention your badge.
I can't touch you! And John, you can't be in here! You'll confuse them!
Wally. This is Danny Witwer. He's from Justice and we're to give him a full run of the farm.
They're not in any pain. We keep their heads pretty well stocked with dopamine and endorphins. Plus, we maintain careful control over their serotonin levels -- don't want 'em to drift off to sleep, but they can't be kept too awake either.
It helps if you don't think of them as human.

Nothing... she grabbed me, and then there was an image on the screen...
Nothing... she grabbed me, and then there was an image on the screen...
She grabbed you? Impossible. The Precogs aren't even aware of us. In the milk all they see is the future.
She was looking right at me.
It could have been a nightmare... Sometimes they dream about the old murders.
She spoke to me.
To you? I don't think so... What'd she say?
To you? I don't think so... What'd she say?
She said...
Wally, listen to me...
Do I know you? Who are you?
I like you, Wally, so I'm not gonna kick you, or hit you with anything, but only if you promise to help me...
Oh... Hi, John.
Are these all of her previsions?
There's no way of knowing for sure. She could've forgotten whatever it is you're looking for...
Just go to the beginning!
Okay. Fine. Where the hell is that?
Detective. Nice of you to come down here. Seeing as every cop in the world is looking for you right now. Jesus, what's up with your eye?
I need your help.

I'm sorry for whatever I'm gonna do! And I swear, I didn't do any of the stuff I did!

Then take her to Radio Shack.
Stop --
Tell me how.
What happened? Where's the rest?
I guess that's all of it.
Rufus, play it back...
Uh, I'll try...
I scored a goal!
That's great.
I won!

Four. Wow. What a big boy. I love you, Sean.

Six years ago. Baltimore. You grabbed a kid at Francis public pool in the West End.
Did I? I don't recall... I got lots of kids from that place --
Do you know who I am?
Some -- somebody's father?
Some -- somebody's father?
His name was Sean. Six years ago. Francis pool.
... and that I needed his help. It wasn't so bad really. I sang him a song, made him laugh, bought him a pretzel. I took care of him. I made him happy.
He's alive?
Where've you got him? Is he all right? Tell me, you fuck -- WHERE IS HE?!
I put him in a barrel and sunk him in the bay.
It floated back up. I had to take him out and --
NO!
You're not gonna kill me?
No.
But you have to. They said you would.
The precogs were wrong.

Yes, I'm afraid that would be from the Doll's Eye.

You have three minutes to tell me what you're doing here before I feed you to a few of my more predacious plants.

Back then, he was still a DA, and quite a few parents of my patients had passed through his courtroom. You have to understand, these people were the dregs of society.

You're saying that I've halo'd innocent people?

This is all my fault.
No, it isn't, Lamar. There was nothing anyone could do.
I haven't worn this damn thing in years. I just wanted to make sure it fits before tonight.
You look great.
It's insanity around here.
I thought you were retiring?

No. That's what everyone thinks. John shot a man dead in Baltimore six months before.
I understand.
No. I don't think you do. The other day, when he came to the cottage, he talked about a lot of things, but Danny Witwer, the man he was supposed to have just killed? He didn't mention him. He didn't say his name even once.
But I also know why he married you: you're as stubborn as he is.
Lamar --

All right. Tell you what I'll do. First thing Monday, I'll look over the Witwer evidence and I'll have Gideon run the Containment files, see if anyone drowned a woman named -- what did you say her name was?

How did you get this?
I padded your expense account for the last six months.
You have an emergency call on your private line.
Thank you. This is Burgess.
He came to see you yesterday. Right before he got tagged. What did you talk about?

Shall we call the Attorney General? I'm sure he'd be happy to clarify the issue for you.
I don't want John Anderton hurt.
Lamar, I found something.
What?

I don't wanna say over the phone, but I think we may be chasing the wrong man.
I don't wanna say over the phone, but I think we may be chasing the wrong man.
Where are you?
Good God. What was that?
Wait, just a second...
He told me about this. You got this from Containment?
Yes. This is from the twins, Arthur and Dashiel. Agatha's stream was missing. Now this one is from the cyberparlor. Anderton downloaded it directly from Agatha. Watch...
It's the same prevision.
Not quite.
Now the second image. Watch the water. The wind's changed. The ripples are going the other way.
I don't understand --
I don't understand --
This murder is happening at two different times.
According to the Sentry, Anderton was watching this at Containment right before he was tagged.
I know. He came to me, told me about the missing data stream. He was concerned that you might find it.
I know. He came to me, told me about the missing data stream. He was concerned that you might find it.
I did find it. It was inside of Agatha all this time. So the question is, why would someone want this erased from the data file?

Danny, tell me what you're thinking.
Danny, tell me what you're thinking.
I'm thinking someone got away with murder.
I'm thinking someone got away with murder.
How?
By fooling the system. All someone would have to do is wait for Precrime to stop the murder from taking place, then, a few minutes later, commit the crime in exactly the same way.
Yes... It's called an echo. The act of murder is such a violent disturbance in the future continuum that it sometimes repeats to the Precogs.

Yes.
Of course, it would have to be someone with access to the Prevision in the first place, someone fairly high up --
Shhh. You know what I hear?
Shhh. You know what I hear?
What?
What?
Nothing. No footsteps coming up the stairs. No hovercraft out the window. No clickity click of little spyders. No one crashing through that door. And do you know why I don't hear any of those things, Danny? Because right now, the Precogs can't see.

The information we need is embedded in the grain of wood. And since each piece is unique, the shape and grain is impossible to duplicate.
I'm sure you've all grasped the legalistic drawback to precrime methodology.
Because of the nature of murder. "There's nothing more destructive to the metaphysical fabric that binds us than the untimely murder of one human being by another".
Somehow, I don't think that was Walt Whitman.
Don't worry. I'll bring him in unharmed.

Actually, Gordon, you're not gonna do that. I'm taking control of the team.
What?!
Sir, the team's gonna be light without those men.
Yes, I know.
Here's where we're at. Three men in a room. The victims here. Anderton here, and this unidentified male out the window. The exterior of the adjacent building suggests public housing, but I can't make out the location. Government architecture is modern/conformist which means --
There's thousands of units like this one.
There's thousands of units like this one.
They're everywhere.
Anderton's smart enough to go where electronic billboards and other media can't ID him to pick his pocket. There's fewer consumers down there, which means fewer scanners to target him.
No offense, sir, but why wouldn't he just run?
No offense, sir, but why wouldn't he just run?
Because he thinks he's innocent.
There are two others in the room besides Anderton and Crow.
Two?
It doesn't matter. He wins.
We can stop him.
We can stop him.
She's in the room with him when he kills Crow. She's already a part of his future.
He's trying to prove his innocence.
He can't download her without a lot of technical help.

No. He can't...

If you were a child killer, you took these pictures, would you leave them out on the bed for anyone to find?

I was a Treasury Agent for eight years. Why?
I was a Treasury Agent for eight years. Why?
Treasury... Then this would be your first actual murder scene.
I worked homicide before I went federal. This is what we would've called an "orgy of evidence". Do you know how many orgies I had as a homicide copy, Gordon?
How many?
How many?
None. This was arranged.
That's why you asked to partner with me on this little sortie, isn't it?
I think you're swell company, Knott.
I think you're swell company, Knott.
It's not at all that you don't trust me to be alone with the Chief. That you think I might, you know, fuck with him, if I had the chance...
People, if you don't let the spyder scan you, we'll have to come in and arrest you.
Knott!
Why don't I feel like celebrating?
Cause all of a sudden you got no one you can fucking brown nose anymore.
John Anderton was my friend!
You "friend's" a murderer and he ruined our perfect record. Six years, not one damn murder...
He looks familiar.
Who?
Who?
The man across the street. I've seen him before...
The man across the street. I've seen him before...

I'd love to, but I've got an open house today at the Ressler place.

He shot a hole in the damn ceiling. So what? You lose your son, let's see how well you handle it.
Not very well, I'm sure. I'd probably start doping myself. Or maybe I'd...
Lamar Burgess thinks that you left John because he lost himself in Precrime instead of you.
I left him because every time I looked at him, I saw my son. Every time I got close to him, I smelled my little boy. That's why I left him. And now you can leave.
You know I need to use you.
To what? Trap him?
To what? Trap him?
To prevent a murder. Sooner or later, he's going to contact you.

Are you telling me they can't see murders anymore?
Are you telling me they can't see murders anymore?
Maybe if he'd taken one of the males. But the female, she's the key. She's the one they listen to, the one with the most talent. The one who takes care of the other two.

How bad is it?
It's bad. Before you even showed up, he said you were Maxie's 'token goons', and not to be trusted. He wanted to TCB alone. I was gonna ride shotgun to keep the English dude above board. Now he's spooked. This shit's snowballing.

Ruiz tied in out there?
Ruiz tied in out there?
Nah, man. No one is. They got some Puerto Ricans and a new crop of fuckin Irish immigrants.
Heard of them.
They ran shit back in the Eighties. Used to cut motherfuckers heads off and sit them on the bar. That's back when the Irish was making a play against the Italians. I don't know if they still around, but I don't fuck with those motherfuckers just in case.

It sounds to me like everybody's just a little jumpy. And since all it is is a drop, the Welshman's got nothing at stake. I say we go to his 'troughed off' bar. It'll calm his nerves, we drop the bag, and we all get back to our lives.

Take it easy, baby.

You saved my life, Archie. Running me out of Harlem. When I think how close we came to gunning each other down, I have to thank Allah.
I wasn't gonna shoot you, baby. It was just my rep, that's all. And don't shit me now, but did you have that number? Tell me.
I wasn't gonna shoot you, baby. It was just my rep, that's all. And don't shit me now, but did you have that number? Tell me.

What did you give it to me for then?
What did you give it to me for then?
'Cause you needed it. 'Cause you couldn't hear me without it.
You ain't lying.
When you go busting your fists against a stone wall, you're not using your brains. Cause that's what the white man wants you to do. Look at you.
Putting all that poison in your hair.
Man, you been locked up too long, everybody conks. All the cats.

I ain't said I'm ashamed.
Leggo. I got to wash it out.
Let it burn. Maybe you'll hear me then.
Sure, burn yourself, pain yourself, put all that poison into your hair, into your body -- trying to be white.
Man, I don't want to hear all that.
Man, I don't want to hear all that.
I thought you was smart. But you just another one of them cats strutting down the avenue in your clown suit with all that mess on you. Like a monkey. And the white man sees you and he laughs. He laughs because he knows you ain't white.
The question is, who are you? You are in the darkness, but it's not your fault. Elijah Muhammad can bring you into the light.
Elijah who?
Elijah who?
Elijah Muhammad can get you out of prison. Out of the prison of your mind. Maybe all you want is another fix. I thought you were smart.
What you sniffing around for? I told you I gave you your last fix.

What do you do with your time?
What do you do with your time?
I read. I study. Because the first thing a black man has to do is respect himself. Respect his body and his mind. Quit taking the white man's poison into your body: his cigarettes, his dope, his liquor, his white woman, his pork.

Come on, daddy, pull my coat. What happens if you give all that up? You get sick or somethin'? I pulled a hustle once and got out of the draft.

I can't make out that shit.
Soiled with dirt, foul; sullen, hostile, forbidding -- as a black day. Foully or outrageously wicked, as black cruelty. Indicating disgrace, dishonor or culpability.
That's bullshit. That's a white man's book. Ain't all these white man's books?
They sure ain't no black man's books in here.

Then what you telling me to study in them for?

Lemme tell you about history: black history. You listening?
You pitch, baby; I'll ketch.
The first men on earth were black. They ruled and there was not one white face anywhere. But they teach us that we lived in caves and swung from trees. Black men were never like that.
Sure, white man throw us a bone and that's supposed to make us forget 400 years.
A black man playing big league ball is something.

I told you to go behind the words and dig out the truth. They let us sing and dance and smile -- and now they let one black man in the majors. That don't cancel out the greatest crime in history. When that blue- eyed devil locked us in chains -- 100,000,000 of us -- broke up our families, tortured us, cut us off
Little.
No. That's the name of the slave- master who owned your family. You don't even know who you are. You're nothing. Less than nothing. A zero. Who are you?
I'm not Malcolm Little and I'm not Satan.
Who are you?
Allah has sent us a prophet, a black man named Elijah Muhammad. For if God is black, Malcolm --
Then the devil is white.

I knew you'd hear me. The white man is the devil. All white men are devils.

No. Elijah Muhammad does not say "that white man is a devil." He teaches us that the white man is the devil. All white men.
The body is a holy repository.
I will not touch the white man's poison: his drugs, his liquor, his carrion, his women.

A Muslim must be strikingly upright. Outstanding. So those in the darkness can see the power of the light.
I will do it.
But the key to Islam is submission. That is why twice daily we turn to Mecca, to the Holy of Holies, to pray. We bend our knees in submission.
I can't.

Yeah. When I was picking a lock to rob somebody's house.
Tell Him that.

I don't know how.

You can grovel and crawl for sin, but not to save your soul. Pick the lock, Malcolm; pick it.

Brother Bembry, can we fix it so our loudspeaker is heard on the street?
I'm sure we can. This is a new sister, Sister Betty.
Now about our coming up in the world a little. You're not naive. You're a man of the world. The Movement's grown; we've grown with it. You know folks. They want their leaders to be prosperous. One hand washes the other.
"I'm telling you God's words, not to hustle."
"I'm telling you God's words, not to hustle."
You want a new car? You want a new house? Is that it? It's the money, right?
What can I do for you?
Mr. X, I was out there tonight. I saw what you did. I want to be a Muslim. I ain't never seen a Negro stand up to the police like that.
Do you?
Not exactly, but I want to be one, like you.
Not exactly, but I want to be one, like you.
I admire your enthusiasm but you should never join any organization without first checking it out thoroughly.
We need more young warriors like yourself, stick around and we shall see if your heart is true.
Mr. X, I won't make you out a liar.
I'll have it tomorrow.
Brother Benjamin, do not rush, it has to be exact.
You are now Benjamin 2X.

Next week, Brother Minister.

Has the Reverend called? Is he going to show?
Make it plain.
And now, without further remarks, I present to you one who is willing to put himself on the line for you --
What?
She ate.
Sure I'll speak to your class. But I'm a hard man on women. You want to know why?
If you want to tell me.
Women talk too much. To tell a woman not to talk is like telling Jesse James not to carry a gun or a hen not to cackle. And Samson, the strongest man that ever lived, was destroyed by the woman who slept in his arms.
Shall I tell my sisters that we oppose marriage?
What points?
That you haven't time for either marriage or eating --
Considering today's standards of animal raising and curing meats, I don't fully understand the restriction on pork.
Let me explain. No. I'll do better than that. I'll show it to you. Scientifically. But it's demonstration purely in the interest of science, you understand?
I see your point.
So it is not a matter of the breeding conditions or preparation of the meat. The meat itself is foul.
Could we sit down someplace?
I'm sorry. I've had you on your feet for hours.
I'm sorry. I've had you on your feet for hours.
You've been on your feet for days. And didn't even finish your salad.

I never told you, but when I first saw you on the podium, cleaning your glasses, I felt sorry for you. Nobody as young as you should be that serious. But I don't think that anymore.
What do you think?

The simplest thing in the world: I want to have a lot of babies with you. Dear Heart, I love you.
Why are you looking at me like that?

Brother Minister, what is wrong?
The way I feel, I ought not to go out there today. In fact, I'm going to ease some of this tension by telling the black man not to fight himself -- that's all a part of the white man's big maneuver, to keep us fighting amongst ourselves, against each other. I'm not fighting anyone, that's not what we're here for.

Mr. Malcolm X, why do you teach black supremacy? Why do you teach hate?
Mr. Malcolm X, why do you teach black supremacy? Why do you teach hate?
For the white man to ask the black man if he hates him is just like the rapist asking the raped, or the wolf asking the sheep, "Do you hate me!" The white man is in no moral position to accuse anyone of hate.
Stop me if I'm wrong. I "polarize the community." I "erroneously appraise the racial picture."
You put it very well.

Well, I have this to say. Do you know what a Negro with a B.A., an M.A. and a Ph.D. is called -- by the white man? I'll tell you. He's called a nigger.
Let him finish.
Thank you. Now the Negro in the field caught hell all day long. He was beaten by the master; he lived in a shack, wore castoff clothes and hated his master.

Got no plans, Rayburn, Nothing on. Just wanted to see you, how you were. Came by on impulse.
You did something on impulse?
Everything happens once if you live long enough.
Your Spanish is good enough. You certainly look the part.
You're crazy. People would hire a has-been, Ray? A drunk?

Well, you'd have to keep it under control.
Well, you'd have to keep it under control.
And what if, just say, there was a kidnap attempt?
And what if, just say, there was a kidnap attempt?
You do your best. They won't be paying you enough to perform miracles.
It's not exactly a scam, Crease. Even at half speed you're pretty damn good.
A bodyguard has to be close to someone all the time. Willing to talk. I'm not good at that.

So you'll be the silent type. People will appreciate that.
What are you doing here?
I came to visit you.
I came to visit you.
Bullshit. I've known you fifteen years. You don't visit.
Bullshit. I've known you fifteen years. You don't visit.
A bodyguard... Who's the guy?
A bodyguard... Who's the guy?
Samuel Ramos. Owns one of the plants in Juarez. The Jap car industry is in the toilet. He's trying to persuade Ford to partner with him. I think he's in trouble. He asked me if I knew anyone he could trust.

Oh, now you think I can be trusted.
Oh, now you think I can be trusted.
Take a job, Creasy. Breathe some air. Then decide if you want to... stick around or not.
There's still ink on my fingers from last week.
You got tossed. Don't trust the cops, especially the Judicials. Oh you know that?
You mean a misfire?
I mean nothing. The hammer came down and nothing happened. Dimple on the primer.

I've heard of it. Never happened to me though. Maybe the firing pin's off.

Creasy?
Sorry I woke you, Ray.
Then one day, he calls and says, 'I'm in love and I'm moving to Mexico.' I said what happened to the plan?
I said the plan was right here.
You got three of the fuckers. All dead.
Pinta...
Pinta...
Two days gone. They're negotiating a ransom.
Stomach's gone. But... okay.
I'll get you up to the border. Friend of mine'll take you in to San Diego. Drop you right at the hospital.
Fuck. Look at you; you won't last a day the shape you're in. Unless you stop bleeding you should have your spleen removed.
Yes or no?
Yes or no?
I won't kill again. Hunt people. I gave that up. Anything else? It's yours.
I'll take the .45 and the Webley .32.
I know it's old fashioned, but it's reliable. Like us.
Cut the stock here. The barrel here. Make sure you file it smooth. Rocket launchers?
Different door. Not far from here.
Do you like dogs, Mr. Creasy?
If they like me.
If they like me.
Frank doesn't take to most people. Do you speak German?
Frank doesn't take to most people. Do you speak German?
Ein Klines Bisschen. [A tiny bit.]
Ein Klines Bisschen. [A tiny bit.]
Frank only responds to commands in German. He was trained in Frankfurt. My Dad loves the idea of having a dog around, but hates the fact he lives inside.
That's 'Bird.' Emilio forgot to take him with when he left.
Who's Emilio?
Who's Emilio?
My last bodyguard. He drove me to school in the morning and picked me up in the afternoon.
In between you can take Mom shopping and to lunch. Does that sound alright, Mr. Creasy?
Creasy. Just call me Creasy.
Creasy. Just call me Creasy.
Creasy...
Where are you from, Creasy?
The United States.
The United States.
I know. But which state?
No.
You can drive and talk at the same time, can't you?
You can drive and talk at the same time, can't you?
No.
No.
Why not?
Why not?
I'm looking for potential.
Potential? I don't understand.
Places where the road bends, places away from buildings, places where the traffic thins out. But you don't have to understand. I do. So no talking.

Being black, is that a positive or negative for a bodyguard in Mexico?

Time will tell.
Time will tell.
There were 24 kidnappings in Mexico City in the last six days. Four a day. What do you think about that, Mr. Creasy?
There were 24 kidnappings in Mexico City in the last six days. Four a day. What do you think about that, Mr. Creasy?
Pretty impressive. Maybe I need to up my fee or get a larger gun.
We're taking a different way home.
That's right.
Did you like school, Creasy?
No.
No.
Not at all?
Not at all?
No.
No.
But why not?
Hmmm?
It wasn't a school like yours and there was no Sister Anna.

Oh...
And don't start crying.
I'm not crying.
Pinta, do you have a pencil?
I go to school, don't I?
You're fast.
Once I get in the water but not starting off. By the time I catch up, it's too late.
What are you doing?
Calling for Emilio's macaw. I thought I heard him.

Do you think he'll come back?

How do you think he got out?

Well, I let him go.
Well, I let him go.
It's better to be free, right?
It's better to be free, right?
Yes. Actually, he was driving me crazy.
They'll be back in a week.
They can stay for two weeks. I don't care.
It hurts.
Where?
Where?
Everywhere!
I don't think they're broken. Anywhere else?
My ankle.
The night you arrived, Mom asked you if you had a family and you lied, didn't you?
White lie. I didn't have a family. But I did have two kids. They're adults now.
Do you always sleep with him?
I'm too old for him. Don't tell my friends.
I'm too old for him. Don't tell my friends.
I don't talk to them much. Does he have a name?
Did you sleep alright?
Yes.
Yes.
How's the ankle? Can you put your weight on it?
How's the ankle? Can you put your weight on it?
It's not too bad. Will it take a long time before it's better? Our big swim meet is in three weeks. Interschools. I was going to swim in the one hundred meter freestyle.
It's not too bad. Will it take a long time before it's better? Our big swim meet is in three weeks. Interschools. I was going to swim in the one hundred meter freestyle.
In a week you should be fine.
Doesn't matter. I always finish second.
You need to practice.
Why do you ask?
It was in a book at school. Concubine.
Well, it's a sort of wife.
But the Emperor of China had 1000 of them! How can that be?

You feel sorry for the husband?

So how come you know so much about those countries?
I had to do my homework on them when I worked there. Also I enjoy history.

No, that was in Columbia.
You don't flinch when a gun goes off; you react. You go. Don't listen for the sound; don't anticipate it. Concentrate on the sound itself.
I don't understand.
I don't understand.
Don't worry. You will.
Remember you asked me what state I was from?
Yes.
Yes.
Where you're from isn't so much about geography; it's about events. Where you're from is what happened to you.
Where you're from isn't so much about geography; it's about events. Where you're from is what happened to you.
Good things happen, too, Creasy. Like meeting me.
Good things happen, too, Creasy. Like meeting me.
I guess that really does make me a hard case.
Do you have a girlfriend, Creasy?
No.
No.
Did you used to?
Did you used to?
Yeah. Two or three.
You're late.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
You were never late before, I was worried.
Where's my mother?
I dropped her at home.
I dropped her at home.
It's no wonder you're late. Why didn't she just come with you?
I'm not afraid you, Creasy.
I know you're not.
I know you're not.
Are you afraid of me?
The gunshot holds no fear. Say it.
The gunshot holds no fear.
The gunshot holds no fear.
You welcome the sound. The sound is what lets you go. The sound is what frees you. You are a prisoner in those blocks until you hear the sound.
I'm tough, Creasy. I'm tough as you.
There's no such thing as tough. You're either trained or untrained.
What's so important in Los Angeles?
Your father has business.
Your father has business.
Why today? And why'd she have to go with him?
The blocks.
I'm a prisoner in them. Until the gunshot sets me free.
Could I ask you a question?
Could I stop you?
Could I stop you?
You don't drink like you used to.
You don't drink like you used to.
That's not a question.
That's not a question.
I know because I go in your room and check the bottles.

Still not a question.

My mom drinks, too... Why do people drink, Creasy?
My mom drinks, too... Why do people drink, Creasy?
Now that's a question. I don't know about your Mom. For me, the problem isn't in the glass. The problem's in between my ears.
Now that's a question. I don't know about your Mom. For me, the problem isn't in the glass. The problem's in between my ears.
You think too much?
You think too much?
Yeah. Because at one time, I didn't think enough.
Pinta, we've got to go. Travel sucks at this time.
Frank. Frankie.
That's strange. Frank was a no-show. Not like him to miss a ride.
You should break all my fingers, Creasy, then tape them back together. I won't be able to play the piano, but I could still swim.

Don't be a baby. You're tougher than that.

I'm going to keep people safe someday. Just like you.

I could do it. Remember the day you wanted the pencil? I know why. And I saw that car again. I wrote the license number in my notebook. Except I missed the last number.
Continue to play in the wrong key, like you're dyslexic.
Dyslexic?
Dyslexic?

You're American.

So are you.
You've done much of this work before?
Never.
Mr. Creasy, I wanted to make sure you have everything you need.
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
Is the food alright? Maria tells me that you didn't eat.
Is the food alright? Maria tells me that you didn't eat.
The food's fine. Sometimes I don't eat.

It insults Maria. Slip it to the dog if you have to... Do you mind if I talk to you for a moment?
How are you getting along with Pinta?
We'll be okay once she realizes I'm not a new toy.
We'll be okay once she realizes I'm not a new toy.
Yes, she told me. Do you have children, Mr. Creasy?
Yes, she told me. Do you have children, Mr. Creasy?
No.
No.
You should know they're tenacious when they want something. And Pinta wants to be friends.
You should know they're tenacious when they want something. And Pinta wants to be friends.
You're paying me to protect her, not amuse her. Right?
Look. Maybe this isn't going to work. Maybe you should ask your husband to hire someone... more sociable.
No, you're right. You were hired to protect her, that's enough. I'm confident you'll do that.
It makes it all seem so serious.
It is serious, Mrs. Ramos.
It is serious, Mrs. Ramos.
Please, it's Lisa... I'll be coming with you tomorrow. I have lunch with friends.
Sorry.
The traffic takes some getting used to.
Jordan!
If something happened, my reaction would be to fight to protect her. I have skills in that respect. Pinta would benefit by the fact that... I'm a soldier.
Why are you here? Why didn't you die?
Because... I was already dead.
They planned it, Samuel and Kalfus.
Planned what?
Planned what?
An autosequestra. Kalfus arranged for Pinta to be taken to a safehouse. I'm sure he thought she'd sit there for three days eating pizza and watching TV. It didn't work out that way. Everything got fucked up when I killed the cops and Tazinari saw an opportunity.
I don't believe you.
I want you to get into your car now and meet me on the south end of the footbridge between Reforma and the freeway junction. In 45 minutes.

Creasy... Wait.
Stay here. If you do something stupid, we won't get her back.

It's Creasy.

The family paid the ransom and he was returned two days later. His father still hasn't gotten up the nerve to ask him if they fucked him up the ass.
And now every mother with money in Mexico City wants bigger and better bodyguards. My own wife included.

Do you know what she told me last night?
Of course I care about Pinta. She'll be as beautiful as her mother one day.
Yeah? And if she was ugly?
All my clients have kidnap and ransom insurance.
I have a policy, AIG. It covers me and my family and when it runs out in sixty days, without a bodyguard, I will not be able to renew it.

I know you need to please Lisa. An ass like that is hard to find. Good bodyguards are even harder.
I know you need to please Lisa. An ass like that is hard to find. Good bodyguards are even harder.
I know! I just had to let one go because I couldn't afford him!
You need a bodyguard of some description. It's a dangerous world we live in. But you will get what you pay for. He doesn't need to be Superman, does he? Can you go fifteen grand?
For a year?
For a year?
For a few months. Hire someone cheap. You have to have a bodyguard to keep the insurance. Then fire him for incompetence. The important thing is Lisa's daughter will return to school.
And Lisa will be able to save face. We won't be the only family without a bodyguard.

[OK, repeat the drop instructions.]
[OK, repeat the drop instructions.]
[The money, 10 million U.S. will be divided into two 15 gallon black canvas bags each containing five million which will be checked at the bank by the K&R agent. Then driven to the house in an armored car where it will be transferred to the delivery car.]

[He has a heart condition. Angina. He responds badly to stress.]
[He has a heart condition. Angina. He responds badly to stress.]
[OK. You will arrive at Columbus Circle and Reforma Avenue at 3AM. You will drive around the square two times. Samuel will remove his shirt and hold it out the window to I.D. the car.]
You should be sleeping, baby.
I'm trying, mom.
Good news. You're going back to school.
When?
When?
Samuel is going to hire a new bodyguard. It may take a few days, but you're going back.
Could he speak English? Emilio couldn't speak English.
We'll see. And thank your father in the morning. A man always needs to be thanked.
Yes, mom?
This is Mr. Creasy.
I like him, Mom.
You do?
You do?
He's like a great big bear. 'Creasy bear'...
I think he's been sick. He's alright now, but I think he's been very, very sick.
Well, think about going to sleep. Good night, baby.
Bye, Mom.
Don't forget your towel.
I'll call you from Detroit, baby.
You're going to miss Mexican Halloween. The Day of the Dead.
A man's worth can be judged by what he has or what he owes. Only the amount matters.

These people are professionals. They don't waste their time taking children whose fathers are virtually bankrupt.

Samuel, it is not something we should skimp on. A bodyguard's presence in the car or outside the school was at least some form of deterrent. Now he's gone, I feel totally exposed.
My wife, Mr. Creasy.
Lisa Martin Ramos, Mr. Creasy.
He has experience in related work. A great deal of it.
Do you have any family, Mr. Creasy?
I think it's nice he's American.
I think it's fantastic.

You realize that you've brought a killer into the house.
She likes him.
Hmm?
Hmm?
Creasy. Pinta likes him.

He has to go, Samuel.
What? Who?

[A bodyguard was shot trying to protect a 9 year old. The bodyguard's American. Not only that he's black.]
[Is that good or bad?]
[Is that good or bad?]
[That's good. Really good. He shot and killed two judicial cops and a kidnapper died in the attack. They're saying he's responsible.]
[He'll die of his wounds; bleed to death before he can do anything.]
[He sounded strong to me. Stronger than we are.]
[Because he's outside. Because he's not tied to the same system we are.]
[We did voice analysis of the last five high profile kidnappings, including the little girl. The same man 'The Dreamer'. Listen to this.]
[I know this. Your point?]
[Creasy is not a policeman. My sense is he could be very valuable to us.]
[Then what do you have to lose?]
[It's a moral issue. On one hand you're cleaning up the bad guys, but in another way we are feeding the problem that produces bad guys.]
[Is it true? Creasy saved the little girl that was kidnapped yesterday.]
[And left three more dead men.]
[When you talked to him, did he look sane?]
[No. Not by the rules of polite society at least.]

[I should start going for your tits first.]
[Who's that?]
[He's the man, 'the Boss?' My guys got into the house on the pretext of giving cholera shots. We had to inject the whole Barrio. We bugged the house and stole the picture of him.]
He's not a cop killer.
I'm sure he isn't. Though he's certainly adept at killing.

I told you she wasn't especially attractive, but that she had a good deal of charm, and she's really a real nice girl...

My son Thomas came to see you this afternoon, and he said to you he wants to cast his mother from his house?
Catherine, don't make an opera outta this. The three-a you anna baby live in three skinny rooms. You are an old goat, and she has an Italian temper. She is a good girl, but you drive her crazy. Catherine, you are no fool. You know this is no good, an old woman living with a husband and wife. Two women inna same kitchen, anna

Oh, Catherine, please! Don't make a tragedy. You come to my house where you know you be happier yourself.

It pains that they should do this.
It pains that they should do this.
I know it pains.
Catherine, you are very dear to me. We have cried many times together. When my husband died, I would have gone insane if it were not for you. I ask you to come to my house, because I can make you happy. Please come to my house.
These are the worst years. I tell you. It's gonna happen to you. I'm afraida look inna mirror. I'm afraid I'm gonna see an old lady with white hair, like the old ladies inna park, little bundles inna black shawl, waiting for the coffin. I'm fifty- six years old. What am I to do with myself?

Oh sure. This girl is a college graduate.
Oh sure. This girl is a college graduate.
They're the worst. College girls are one step from the streets. They smoke like men inna saloon. My son Joseph, his wife, you know, she types onna typewriter. One step from the streets, I tell you. Mrs. Pilletti ponders this philosophy for a moment.

That's the first time Marty ever brought a girl to this house. She seems like a nice girl. I think he has a feeling for this girl. You heard him sing. He been singing like that all morning.
Well, that's all. You will see. Today, tomorrow, inna week, he's gonna say to you, "Hey, Ma, it's no good being a single man. I'm tired-a running around." Then he's gonna say, "Hey, Ma, wadda we need this old house? Why don't we sell this old house, move into a nicer parta town? A nice little apartment?"
I don't sell this house, I tell you that. This is my husband's house. I had six children in this house.
I don't sell this house, I tell you that. This is my husband's house. I had six children in this house.

You will see. A coupla months, you gonna be an old lady, sleeping onna couch in her daughter-in-law's house.
Catherine, you are a blanket of gloom. Wherever you are, the rain follows. Someday, you gonna smile, and we gonna declare a holiday.
You come up here often?
I was up here twice before. Once with a friend of mine and once I came up alone. The last time... do you see that girl in the gray dress sitting over there?
I was up here twice before. Once with a friend of mine and once I came up alone. The last time... do you see that girl in the gray dress sitting over there?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, the last time I was up here, that's where I sat. I sat there for an hour and a half, without moving a muscle. Now and then, some fellow would sort of walk up to me and then change his mind. I'll never forget just sitting there for an hour and a half with my hands in my lap. Then I began to

This is something recent with me, this bursting into tears at the least thing.
This is something recent with me, this bursting into tears at the least thing.
Oh, I cry all the time, any little thing. My brothers, my brother-in- laws, they're always telling me what a goodhearted guy I am. Well, you don't get goodhearted by accident. You get kicked around long enough, you get to be a real professor of pain. I know exactly how you feel. And I also want you to know I'm having a very good

So there you are. So I guess I'm not such a dog as I think I am.

You're a very nice guy, and I don't know why some girl hasn't grabbed you off long ago.
You're a very nice guy, and I don't know why some girl hasn't grabbed you off long ago.
I don't know either. I think I'm a very nice guy. I also think I'm a pretty smart guy in my own way.
I'm twenty-nine years old. How old are you?
I'm thirty-four.
...you teach chemistry? That's funny. Where? What school?
Benjamin Franklin High School.
Benjamin Franklin High School.
Benjamin Franklin, where's that? Brooklyn? I went to Theodore Roosevelt right up here on Fordham Road. It's right arounna corner from my house. I have a cousin who's a teacher. He teaches Latin. He lives in Chicago. He was studying to be a Jesuit, but he gave it up after his first vows.
You gotta real nice face, you know? It's really a nice face.
Thank you.
...When I got outta the army, Clara, I was lost. I didn't know what I wanted to do. I was twenny-five years old, what was I gonna do, go back to my old job, forty cents an hour. I thought maybe I go to college under the G.I. Biller Rights, you know? But I wouldn't graduate till I was twenny-eight, twenny-nine years old, even
Yes, I know.
Yes, I know.
I'm a Catholic, you know, and even to think about suicide is a terrible sin.
I'm a Catholic, you know, and even to think about suicide is a terrible sin.
Yes, I know.
Yes, I know.
So then Mr. Gazzara -- he was a frienda my father -- he offered me this job in his butcher shop, and everybody pleaded with me to take it. So that's what happened. I didn't wanna be a butcher.

There's nothing wrong with being a butcher.
There's nothing wrong with being a butcher.
Well, I wouldn't call it an elegant profession. It's in a lower social scale. People look down on butchers.
Well, I wouldn't call it an elegant profession. It's in a lower social scale. People look down on butchers.
I don't.
Well, the point is Mr. Gazzara wantsa sell his shop now, because he and his wife are lonely, and they wanna move out to California in Los Angeles and live near their married daughter. Because she's always writing them to come out there. So it's a nice little shop. I handle his books for him, so I know he has a thirty-five percent markup
It's my feeling that you really want to buy this shop, Marty.
It's my feeling that you really want to buy this shop, Marty.
That's true. I do. But I'm gonna have to take outta loan inna bank eight thousand dollars. That's a big note to carry, because I have to give Mr. Gazzara a mortgage, and what I have to weigh is: will it pay off in the end more than I can make onna salary?
Wadda you think?
I think anything you want to do, you'll do well.
I only got about three bucks on me now, but I just live about eight blocks from here on the other side of Webster Avenue. Why don't we walk back to my house? I'll run in, pick up some dough, and let's step out somewhere.
I really should get home...
It's only a quarter of twelve. The clock's right over there.
I really should get home, I told my father... Well, I suppose a little while longer. I wonder if there's any place around here I could put some makeup on...
...It's really a fine opportunity for me. But I'm not sure I want to be a department head. It's mostly executive and administrative work. Well, anyway, I told you about my father, and he depends on me a great deal, and...
Why don't you just move out to Portchester?
Why don't you just move out to Portchester?
Well, that's what I was saying. My father is getting old. And we're very close. He's a wonderful man, really...
I think you're kidding yourself, Clara. I used to think about moving out, you know? And that's what I used to say. "My mother needs me." But when you really get down to it, that ain't it at all. Actually, you need your father. You know what I mean? You're living at home, and you got your father and mother there, and you can
I'm afraid of being lonely.
I'm afraid of being lonely.
Oh, you won't be so lonely. You'll make friends right away.
Oh, you won't be so lonely. You'll make friends right away.
Actually, I don't make friends easily.
Actually, I don't make friends easily.
What're you talking about? You're a real likeable person. You'll make friends out there in Portchester one, two, three. You'll have people visiting you alla time. I'll come visit you. I'll borrow my brother Freddie's car, or you can call me up when you feel blue, or I'll call you up. And it's gonna be nice. Don't be so afraid.
This is the kitchen.
Yes, I know.
Yes, I know.
Come on inna dining room.
Siddown, take off your coat. You want something to eat? We gotta whole half-chicken in the icebox.
No, thank you. I don't think I should stay very long.
No, thank you. I don't think I should stay very long.
Sure. Just take off your coat a minute.
So I was telling you, my kid brother Nickie got married last Sunday. That was a very nice affair. And they had this statue of some woman, and they had whiskey spouting outta her mouth. I never saw anything so grand in my life. And watta meal. I'm a butcher, so I know a good hunka steak when I see one. That was choice
Oh, I'm fine.
Oh, I'm fine.
You want me to take you home, I'll take you home.
You want me to take you home, I'll take you home.

Well, siddown a minute. I just come inna house. I'll take off my coat. Siddown a minute.
No, thank you, really, Mrs. Pilletti.
It's a very sad business, I tell you. A woman, fifty-six years old, all her life, she had her own home. Now she's just an old lady, sleeping on her daughter-in-law's couch. It's a curse to be a mother, I tell you. Your children grow up and then what is left for you to do? What is a mother's life but her children? It

Couldn't she find some sort of hobby to fill out her time?

Hobby! What can she do? She cooks and she cleans. You gotta have a house to clean. You gotta have children to cook for. These are the terrible years for a woman, the terrible years.
You mustn't feel too harshly against her daughter-in-law. She also wants to have a house to clean and a family to cook for.
You don't think my sister Catherine should live in her daughter-in-law's house?
Well, I don't know the people, of course, but as a rule, I don't think a mother-in-law should live with a young couple.
Well, I don't know the people, of course, but as a rule, I don't think a mother-in-law should live with a young couple.
Where do you think a mother-in-law should go?

I don't think a mother should depend so much upon her children for her rewards in life.
Well, maybe that's what they teach you in New York University. In real life, it don't work out that way. You wait till you are a mother.
Well, maybe that's what they teach you in New York University. In real life, it don't work out that way. You wait till you are a mother.
It's silly of me to argue about it. I don't know the people involved.
It was very nice meeting you, Mrs. Pilletti. I hope I'll see you again.
Sure.
Goodnight, Mrs. Pilletti.
Goodnight.
You say something?
Yeah. I was just asking you if you was here stag or with a girl.
Yeah. I was just asking you if you was here stag or with a girl.
I'm stag.
I'm stag.
Well, I'll tell you. I got stuck on a blind date with a dog, and I just met an old girl I used to know, and I was wondering how I'm gonna get rid of the girl I'm with. Somebody to take her home, you know what I mean? I'd be glad to pay you five bucks if you take her home for me.

What?
What?
I'll take you over, and I'll introduce you as an old army buddy of mine, and then I'll cut out. Because I got this other girl waiting for me out by the hatcheck, and I'll pay you five bucks.

I'll see you.
She was always a bit thin in the hips...
Well, at the time she told me this, she already had six. Every time I saw the woman, she was either...
And that husband of hers is a skinny bit of a fellow, isn't he?
Well, I bumped into her on the street, and she was as big as a barrel.
Oh, that's nice. So the doctor was wrong, wasn't he?
Oh, no! She died right in the hospital...
Oh, no! She died right in the hospital...
Oh, that's a sad story. And her husband is that little fellow, works in Peter Reeves.

...so the whole book winds up, Mike Hammer, he's inna room there with this doll. So he says, "You rat, you are the murderer." So she begins to con him, you know? She tells him how she loves him. And then Bam! He shoots her in the stomach. So she's laying there, gasping for breath, and she says, "How could you do that?" And
Boy, that Mickey Spillane, boy he can write.
What I like about Mickey Spillane is he knows how to handle women. In one book, he picks up a tomato who gets hit with a car, and she throws a pass at him. And then he meets two beautiful twins, and they throw passes at him. And then he meets some beautiful society leader, and she throws a pass at him, and...
Boy, that Mickey Spillane, he sure can write.
I always figure a guy oughta marry a girl who's twenny years younger than he is so that when he's forty, his wife is a real nice-looking doll.
That means he'd have to marry the girl when she was one year old.
That means he'd have to marry the girl when she was one year old.

Sooner or later, there comes a point in a man's life when he gotta face some facts, and one fact I gotta face is that whatever it is that women like, I ain't got it. I chased enough girls in my life.

And plenty-a times in my life, I feel like throwing the milk bottle at her myself. And I tell you now, as far as I'm concerned, if Catherine wantsa come live here with me and

Well, there's the Stardust Ballroom. That's a kind of a big dance hall. Every Saturday night, it's just loaded with girls. It's a nice place to go. You pay seventy-seven cents. It used to be seventy-seven cents. It must be about a buck and half now. And you go in and you ask some girl to dance. That's how I met Virginia. Nice, respectable

Don't worry. I'm gonna take care-a the whole thing.
Ma, you want something to eat, some tuna fish?

So she say, "You're spilling the milk." So she kept talking about these coupla drops of milk I spilled, so she got me so mad, so I said, "Mama, you wanna see me really spill some milk?" So I took the bottle, and I threw it against the door. I didn't throw it at her. That's just something she made up. She goes around

No, Virginia, I know how you feel.
No, Virginia, I know how you feel.
I just can't stand it any more! Every minute of the day! Do this! Do that! I don't have ten minutes privacy with my husband! We can't even have a fight! We don't have no privacy! Everybody's miserable in our house!
I'm sorry we gotta rush like this...
That's all right, that's all right...
That's all right, that's all right...
On accounta...
On accounta...
I'm gonna see you tonight...
We didn't tell her anything yet. We thought that we'd leave it to you. We thought you'd put it like how you were lonely, and why don't she come to live with you. Because that way it looks like she's doing you a favor, insteada we're throwing her out, and it won't be so cruel on her. Do you want Tommy and me to
I think it be a better idea if you and Thomas go out, because otherwise she's gonna start a fight with you, and everybody's gonna be yelling.

Tommy, I promised the babysitter six o'clock.
Tommy!
I'll see you at mass tomorrow. We'll sit down and we'll discuss the whole thing.
Don't you think I feel lousy about this too?
All right, Ginnie. I don't wanna talk anymore about it. I don't think I got one hour's sleep the whole night. Last night was the first time in my life I ever heard my mother cry, you know that?

Why do you always put me inna position of being the louse?

There's sort of a built-in prayer for the sick man to get well, but of course that's not the basic intention.
I don't care about the intention. I just know your Cross Action is a plus on our side. I've seen it come through four times.
We wanted to tell you how you were helping us with your fixes.
Well, sure, but I'm also worried about Walt Waldowski  Painless. His poker players got in an argument and asked him for a ruling, and he said what difference did it make, it was just a card game.
How they goin', Losing Preacher? What do you hear from the Pope?
You talked to Walt?
You talked to Walt?
He's parted his moorings.
What do you want me to do?
Put in one of your fixes. Walt knows he's loused himself with the Church, but it's part of our plan to make him think he has the keys to the kingdom. Which he will think if you grease the skids for him.

Just use common sense. Your job is preventing sin, and the way to do that is give him your best Cross Action.
Nice looking kid. Going to be okay?
He'll live if that's what you mean. But somebody better be around when he comes to and finds out there's nothing left between his legs.
What do I do with it Hawk? This is a little out of my line.
Didn't recognize you, Red. When you get the clamp all the way down, open it as wide as you can and see if you can close it on the artery.

They've hit us on Cherry Hill. I just got word. We have our slack periods but when the action starts, you'll have more work in twelve hours than a civilian surgeon does in a week.
I may need you to go to work practically immediately. But meanwhile perhaps you'd like to meet some of your fellow officers.
Just one for a start.
Yeah, maybe move that nurse in. She don't seem the type to keep you awake praying.
I have been in this Army a long time. I know just what you guys are up to. But there are limits...
