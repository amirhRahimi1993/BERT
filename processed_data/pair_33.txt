She is a true psychic. She sees beyond the relativity of time. For her there is no past, present or future. There is only what is.
And she's never wrong.
And she's never wrong.
Don't think of it in terms of right and wrong. She is a guide, Neo. She can help you find the path.
Don't think of it in terms of right and wrong. She is a guide, Neo. She can help you find the path.
She helped you?
She helped you?
Yes.
Yes.
What did she tell you?
What did she tell you?
That I would find the One.
Morpheus, I don't think this is a good idea.
Why?
Why?
I told you I don't believe in this stuff. No matter what she says I'm not going to believe it, so what's the point?
I told you I don't believe in this stuff. No matter what she says I'm not going to believe it, so what's the point?
What do you believe in?
What do you believe in?
What do I believe it? Are you kidding me? What do you think? I'm still trying to deal with the fact that everything I believed was real, wasn't. The whole world, my entire life was a lie. I don't know anything anymore, Morpheus.
What do I believe it? Are you kidding me? What do you think? I'm still trying to deal with the fact that everything I believed was real, wasn't. The whole world, my entire life was a lie. I don't know anything anymore, Morpheus.
That's why we're here.
That's why we're here.
Why? So I can hear some old lady tell me, what? That I'm this guy that everybody's been waiting for? The one that's supposed to save the world? Come on. How do I respond to that? I can't. It's ridiculous. I mean who am I? I'm nobody, I'm just a guy. What did I do, Morpheus? Why me?

Faith is beyond the reach of whys and why nots. These things are not a matter of cause and effect, Neo. I do not believe things with my mind. I believe them with my heart. In my gut.
Faith is beyond the reach of whys and why nots. These things are not a matter of cause and effect, Neo. I do not believe things with my mind. I believe them with my heart. In my gut.
And you still believe I'm the One?
And you still believe I'm the One?
Yes I do.
Yes I do.
Yeah? What about the other five guys? The five before me? What about them?
Did you believe in them too?
No. I did not. I have never told anyone this, Neo. After I saw the Oracle I thought... no, I misunderstood what she told me. I believed that it was all about me. That I would find the One, not that he would find me.
Listen to me, Neo. I know why you're afraid to go through that door. You can't get free of thinking that I could be wrong. You must believe me. There is a greatness inside of you, Neo. A greatness that is going to lift you to unimaginable heights and that in time will change the world.
Morpheus, I don't know --
Morpheus, I don't know --
I know. That is why it is so important for you to go. Please, Neo, I'm asking you to find whatever respect you may have for me and trust me.
No. No! Morpheus! Don't!
Trinity! Go! Get to the basement. Find the catch basin!
Morpheus, the Oracle... she told me --
She told you exactly what you needed to hear. That's all. Sooner or later, Neo, you're going to realize just like I did the difference between knowing the path and walking the path.
How is he?
Ten hours straight. He's a machine.
Got it.
I need the main wet-wall.
Now left and that's it in front of you.
Good.
Tank.
Goddamn! It's good to hear your voice, sir!
Goddamn! It's good to hear your voice, sir!
We need an exit.
We need an exit.
Got one ready, sir. Subway. State and Balbo.
Got one ready, sir. Subway. State and Balbo.
We're on our way --
Tank, charge the E.M.P.
Yes, sir.
I'm going to make the call.
Do it!
How...?!
He is the One. He is the One!
Hello?
I know. You're Neo. Be right with you.
I know. You're Neo. Be right with you.
You're the Oracle?
You're the Oracle?
Bingo. Not quite what you were expecting, right? I got to say I love seeing you non-believers. Always a pip. Almost done. Smell good, don't they?
Bingo. Not quite what you were expecting, right? I got to say I love seeing you non-believers. Always a pip. Almost done. Smell good, don't they?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'd ask you to sit down, but you're not going to anyway. And don't worry about the vase.
I'd ask you to sit down, but you're not going to anyway. And don't worry about the vase.
What vase?
That vase.
Shit, I'm sorry.
I said don't worry about it. I'll get one of my kids to fix it.
How did you know...?
You're cuter than I thought. I see why she likes you.
Who?
Who?
Not too bright though.
So? What do you think? You think you're the One?
Honestly? I don't know.
Okay, now I'm supposed to say, 'Hmmm, that's interesting but...' Then you say --
But what?
But what?
But you already know what I'm going to tell you.
But you already know what I'm going to tell you.
I'm not the One.
I'm not the One.
Sorry, kid. You got the gift but looks like you're waiting for something.
Sorry, kid. You got the gift but looks like you're waiting for something.
What?
What?
Your next life, maybe. Who knows. That's how these things go.
What's funny?
Morpheus. He almost had me convinced.
Morpheus. He almost had me convinced.
I know. Poor Morpheus. Without him we are lost. We will never find the One.
I know. Poor Morpheus. Without him we are lost. We will never find the One.
What do you mean, without him?
Morpheus believes in you, Neo and no one, not you or even me can convince him otherwise. He believes it so blindly that he's going to sacrifice his life to save yours.
What?
What?
You're going to have to make a final choice. In one hand, you will have Morpheus' life. In the other hand, you will have your own. One of you is going to die. Which one, will be up to you.
Hello, Neo.
How do you know that name?
How do you know that name?
I know a lot about you. I've been wanting to meet you for some time.
I know a lot about you. I've been wanting to meet you for some time.
Who are you?
Who are you?
My name is Trinity.
My name is Trinity.
Trinity? The Trinity? The Trinity that cracked the I.R.S. Kansas City D-Base?
Trinity? The Trinity? The Trinity that cracked the I.R.S. Kansas City D-Base?
That was a long time ago.
That was a long time ago.
Gee-zus.
Gee-zus.
What?
What?
I just thought... you were a guy.
I just thought... you were a guy.
Most guys do.
Do you want to go somewhere and talk?
No. It's safe here and I don't have much time.
How did you do that?
Right now, all I can tell you, is that you are in danger. I brought you here to warn you.
Right now, all I can tell you, is that you are in danger. I brought you here to warn you.
Of what?
Of what?
They're watching you, Neo.
They're watching you, Neo.
Who is?
Who is?
Please. Just listen. I know why you're here, Neo. I know why you left your family and your friends, why you left your home to come to this city. You're looking for him.
It's the question that brought you here. You know the question just as I did. It is a hacker's question.
What is the Matrix?
What is the Matrix?
When I asked him, he said that no one could ever be told the answer to that question. They have to see it to believe it.
What the hell is this?!
It's necessary, Neo. For our protection.
It's necessary, Neo. For our protection.
From what?
From what?
From you.
Neo, please, you have to trust me.
Why?
Why?
Because you've been down there, Neo. You already know that road. You know exactly where it ends.
And I know that's not where you want to be.
... shit.
What is this thing?
We think you're bugged. Try to relax.
Uh-oh...
It's going into replication.
Get this thing out of me!
Easy, Neo. Easy.
E.M.P. An electromagnetic pulse.
It disables any electrical system in the blast radius. It's the only weapon we have against the machines.
God...
What?
What?
I used to eat there... Really good noodles.
What does that mean?
That the Matrix cannot tell you who you are.
That the Matrix cannot tell you who you are.
But an Oracle can.
But an Oracle can.
That's different.
That's different.
Is it?
Is it?
Are you worried?
Are you worried?
Should I be?
Should I be?
No.
Did you go to her?
Yes.
Yes.
What did she tell you?
What did she tell you?
She told me...
Are you all right?
... right as rain.
What did you just say?
Nothing. Just had a little deja vu.
Nothing. Just had a little deja vu.
What happened? What did you see?
What happened? What did you see?
A black cat went past us and then I saw another that looked just like it.
A black cat went past us and then I saw another that looked just like it.
How much like it? Was it the same cat?
How much like it? Was it the same cat?
It might have been. I'm not sure.
What is it?
A deju vu is usually a glitch in the Matrix. It happens when they change something.
Go!
We can't leave him!
We can't leave him!
We have to!
Is Morpheus alive?
Is Morpheus still alive, Tank?
What happened?
I don't know. It just went dead.
Goddamnit! Goddamnit!
There has to be something that we can do.
That I would have to make a choice...
What choice?
What are you doing?
I'm going in after him.
I'm going in after him.
You can't!
You can't!
I have to.
I have to.
Morpheus sacrificed himself so we could get you out! There's no way you're going back in!
Morpheus sacrificed himself so we could get you out! There's no way you're going back in!
Morpheus did what he did because he believed that I'm something I'm not.
Morpheus did what he did because he believed that I'm something I'm not.
What?
What?
I'm not the One, Trinity. The Oracle hit me with that too.
No, you... have to be.
I'm sorry, I'm not. I'm just another guy. Morpheus is the one that matters.
I'm sorry, I'm not. I'm just another guy. Morpheus is the one that matters.
No, Neo. That's not true. It can't be true.
No, Neo. That's not true. It can't be true.
Why?
Why?
Because...
What?
I believe I can bring him back.
What are you doing?
I'm coming with you.
I'm coming with you.
No, you're not.
No, you're not.
No? Let me tell you what I believe. I believe Morpheus means more to me than he does to you. I believe that if you are serious about saving him then you are going to need my help and since I am the ranking officer on this ship, if you don't like it then I believe that you can go to hell, because you
No one has ever done anything like this.
Yeah?
Neo, how did you do that?
Do what?
Do what?
You moved like they moved. I've never seen anyone move that fast.
You moved like they moved. I've never seen anyone move that fast.
It wasn't fast enough.
Are you all right?
I'm fine. Come on, we have to keep moving.
Can you fly that thing.
Not yet.
Morning. Did you sleep?
No.
No.
You will tonight. I guarantee it. I'm Tank. I'll be your operator.
You don't have...
Any holes? Nope. Me and my brother Dozer, we are 100 percent pure, old- fashioned, home-grown human. Born free. Right here in the real world. Genuine child of Zion.

Zion?
Zion?
If this war ended tomorrow, Zion is where the party would be.
If this war ended tomorrow, Zion is where the party would be.
It's a city?
It's a city?
The last human city. The only place we got left.
The last human city. The only place we got left.
Where is it?
Where is it?
Deep underground. Near the earth's core, where it's still warm. You live long enough, you might even see it.
Holy shit!
Hey, Mikey, he likes it! Ready for more?
Hey, Mikey, he likes it! Ready for more?
Hell yes!
See who?
The Oracle.
What are they doing to him?
They're hacking his mind.
They're hacking his mind.
How?
How?
They inject virus-like serums to attack the neuro-systems. It's like cracking a computer. All it takes is time.
They inject virus-like serums to attack the neuro-systems. It's like cracking a computer. All it takes is time.
How much time?
How much time?
Depends on the mind. But eventually, it will crack and his alpha pattern will change from this to this.
When it does, Morpheus will tell them anything they want to know.
What do they want?
What do they want?
Every leader of every ship is given the codes to Zion's mainframe computer which can be accessed only through the Matrix. They are used only in emergencies. If an agent had those codes and got inside Zion's mainframe they could disable the entire defense system. It would be the end of everything.
Goddamnit! I don't believe this is happening!
Neo, this has to be done!
Neo, this has to be done!
Does it? I don't know. This can't be just coincidence. It can't be! Can it?
Does it? I don't know. This can't be just coincidence. It can't be! Can it?
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
The Oracle. She told me this would happen. She told me...
Neo, this is loco. They've got Morpheus in a military-controlled building. Even if you somehow got inside, those are agents holding him. Three of them! I want Morpheus back, too, but what you are talking about is suicide.
I know that's what it looks like, but it's not. I can't logically explain to you why it's not. Morpheus believed something and he was ready to give his life for what he believed. I understand that now. That's why I have to go.

Why?
Why?
Because I believe in something.
Okay. Store's open. What do you need? Besides a miracle...
Guns. Lots of guns.
Operator.
Mr. Wizard, get me the fuck out of here!
Which way? Which way?
Duck!
It's locked.
Kick it in! Kick it in!
Operator.
Tank, it's me.
Yes. They're moving him. I don't know where yet.
He's alive.
We need an exit!
You're not far from Cypher.
You're not far from Cypher.
Cypher, I thought --
Cypher, I thought --
So did we. I sent him to Franklin and Erie.
So did we. I sent him to Franklin and Erie.
Got it.
Tank, you're hurt.
I'll be all right.
I'll be all right.
Dozer?
There is. We have to pull the plug.
You're going to kill him? Kill Morpheus?!
You're going to kill him? Kill Morpheus?!
Trinity, we don't have any other choice.
Operator.
Tank, I need a pilot program for a military M-109 helicopter.
Neo!
What the hell just happened?
What the hell just happened?
An Agent! You have to send me back!
An Agent! You have to send me back!
I can't!
What just happened?
I don't know. I lost him.
They've burned through the outer shields.
Hurry, Neo.
Isn't this Jack Groppi's place?
Yeah. But he ain't here now.
Yeah. But he ain't here now.
Know where he is?
Know where he is?
Follow me.
No, really, I liked it...thought it was great.
Thanks.
What are your plans?
Well, we're here for about two weeks, then whatever else comes along... we're still working on our album and...

Of course, 'The Season of the Witch' won't be ready for a while yet but we have to keep in touch.
It's obvious that the girl doesn't want to accompany you, isn't it?
Look fella...this is private...
Look fella...this is private...
Nothing's private...
Whether she wants to or not...she's not going.
Let go of her.
We went down to Chinatown but they don't have any.
Yeah, well, keep away from those Chinx. They don't have shit.
Well, I don't know if we want to buy all $40 worth...
Hey! You want good stuff, or you want shit?
No.
That means it's good.
That means it's good.
You got sparklers?
No, all we got is $40.
You sure?
Riverdale.
Well, maybe they do that in Riverdale, but down here we take cash. Now, you got it or not?
Sssh! Quiet. Y'know that's illegal.
Well the guy over there said...
Well the guy over there said...
Yeah, yeah, never mind. You gotta be careful.
Well, we got $40, and we wanna buy...
All right! Quiet! For $40 I could give you...
Well, we want good stuff.
Well, my stuff comes from Maryland... you know what that means?
Yeah.
And cherry bombs...ash cans...and rockets?
And cherry bombs...ash cans...and rockets?
Ok. For another $5.00 a special on the packs.
Yeah.
Ok. Wait here.
Ok, you guys get out, and wait here for me.
Why?
Why?
I gotta get the stuff.
I gotta get the stuff.
Can't we come with you?
Can't we come with you?
Nobody sees where I get the stuff. That's good business. I'll be back in thirty minutes.
Hey hold it! Gimmie the cash.
Uh...can we give you a check?
Uh...can we give you a check?
A check? What the...hey, where you kids from?
Keep quiet about this. I don't have any license for him yet. I've only had him a couple of days. Nobody can feed him except me. I'm the only one he trusts. Watch.
Don't go to any trouble. We believe you... We believe you.
Really wanted to get a little tiger Charlie, y'know...a little William Blake and all that...
Be careful.
See what I mean? A question please...'Is this what you call living?'
'Take a little tip from Mack the Knife...'
And I wouldn't call it TONY'S PLACE or CHARLIE'S PLACE... I'd call it something like SEASON OF THE WITCH... get it?
You are with out a doubt the biggest, most pretentious bullshit thrower I know. Like to see what kind of business you'd do.
You are with out a doubt the biggest, most pretentious bullshit thrower I know. Like to see what kind of business you'd do.
Look who's talking. Pretentious bullshit. Who's the guy with William Blake and the tigers, eh?
No.
Anybody wanna have a game?
May God be with you.

Salute!!!
'Art thou the King of the Jews'?
'Dost thou say this of thyself, or have others told thee of me?'
'My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world my followers would have fought that I might not be delivered to the Jews. But, as it is my kingdom is not from here.'
'Thou art then a king?'
'Thou art then a king?'
'Thou sayest it; I am a king. This is why I was born and why I have come into this world, to bear witness to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth hears my voice.'
Prophesy to us, oh Christ! Who is it that struck thee?
I don't know, but God help him if he does it again!
Who's the girl?

Yes, you're gettin' it all over my tie.
Should I slap him?
I don't think I should go home looking like this. You think I could stay at your place tonight? Your mother's not there is she?
No, she isn't.
You'd better make a move kid. He thinks you're trying to screw him.
Wouldn't bother me.
Wouldn't bother me.

That'll help you out fine. That's the best way for you, not for me! I swear to God, I'll rip you open if my uncle ever hears a word about this. You understand? I don't care what happens, he doesn't find out.
I don't get involved with anything, you understand that? Nothing! I'm clean as far as you know...right?
Yeah, take it easy. Will you relax.
Yeah, take it easy. Will you relax.
That's what I get for getting involved. Look, on pay-day at least show up at Tony's Place to meet him, ok? This way he doesn't think that you're trying to screw him. If you show good faith and save his face maybe we can talk and he'll take off the interest or make different payment arrangements or something... understand? I'm not asking I'm telling

I understand.
Keep your mouth shut.
You tell me that in front of these creeps?
Shut up!
Yeah, Teresa, shut up! We don't wanna get Charlie here in trouble, do we?...We love Charlie.
Your cousin here was getting sick, worrying about you. We've been in here calling...
Oh, that's too bad, Teresa...
Well kids...have the bans been announced yet?
Don't be smart.
Don't be smart.
I'm not smart...I'm stupid, remember. I'm so stupid that you have to look out for me, remember?
Johnny, I swear to God, if you open your mouth about any of this...
Me? I wouldn't say a word to my aunt and uncle...or even your uncle, Charlie...
You threaten me with my uncle? After what I'm doing for you?
What you're doing for me isn't worth it...believe me!
Take it. I'm doing it for you, stupid!
No you're not...
Oh, cut it out, will ya?
Charlie, twenty-eight bucks is nothing. The only way to do it is through your uncle...think about it will you?
Charlie, twenty-eight bucks is nothing. The only way to do it is through your uncle...think about it will you?

Come on.
Don't you move!!!
I'll be here. Don't worry.
Back so soon.
Mind your own business.
Hello, Michael. I've got something for you...not much...but...
He has about twenty-eight bucks... it's all he has on him.
I think we should see your uncle.
No.
No.
This can't be settled any other way now...I'll take full blame.
This can't be settled any other way now...I'll take full blame.
Forget it.
What are you going to do? Hide me?
Good idea.
Hey...you're here. They told me you're here...and you're here. How are you?
Ok, how's everything going?
Don't ask...do you have any idea what I've been doing all morning...eh?
No.
No.
I was in the basement fixing the pipes. Would you believe that?
I was in the basement fixing the pipes. Would you believe that?
What pipes?
What pipes?
What pipes...the ones from last year...those pipes.
Look Charlie, you're a good boy. Will you just tell your uncle that I have nothing. There is nothing to give him. No envelopes with cash inside, no checks, nothing.
That bad, huh?

I can't make this week's payment and if this keeps up not next week's either.

Not next week's either...listen...you tell that to Giovanni, not me.
Listen, I should wrap up this place in a ribbon and hand it to him, you know that. I don't need this aggravation. I'm getting old.

He'd rather have the loan payed, you know that.
Your Uncle's a good man...I won't stick him. Either he gets the money or the place and right now he's getting the place. And tell me why should I care? I got a partner who's a bum, who doesn't help out...who disappears and leaves me with all the problems. I should go back to Florida...I don't need this.
I don't understand, where's Groppi?
I don't understand, where's Groppi?
I should know? His wife don't even know. Probably off with one of his little girls...I don't know. I tell you, if he don't give a damn, then I don't give a damn...Why should I kill myself?

My uncle figured that this week was bad...but about next week...I dunno. Maybe you should speak to him yourself.

What can I say?
Oh great...hey - Winstons?
For these prices don't be particular. That's all they had - but next week we'll see...

I'd like to know Charlie, it looks like your little friend is trying to duck me...

Michael, nobody's out to screw you, I guarrantee that.
Michael, nobody's out to screw you, I guarrantee that.
I know that Charlie but look at my side. You undersigned the loans. You vouched for him. What happens if this kid don't pay me? I gotta collect from you? I don't want to do that. I made a deal with him not you, right?

You're right. You're right. Look, I'm not gonna wind up paying his debts. You know that.
I don't know that. That's what I'm telling you.

'Amen I say to thee, thou wilt not come out from it until thou hast paid the last penny.'
'Amen I say to thee, thou wilt not come out from it until thou hast paid the last penny.'

Be seeing you and Johnny tonight... here...right?
We'll be here.
Look, Michael, I'll get him here. What do you want me to do, kill him?
Whatever.
Where's the rest?
Yeah, where's the rest?
You're really crazy.
You're not going to use that gun, Johnny.
Diane, how are you feeling?
Fine.
You know Diane...I've been wanting to talk to you for a while now...er... a... aside from all that joking around we do out there...when you're on...I... a...I really...think that you're a terrific performer...
Fine.
Fine.
No, I'm serious...You're really good.
No, I'm serious...You're really good.

Uncle, how are you feeling?
Fine. Did you have a good time last night?
Fine. Did you have a good time last night?
About that shooting last night...I was there and...
About that shooting last night...I was there and...
No you weren't.
You're right uncle. I must have gotten it confused with something else.
Yes, you did.
About Oscar...I think he put on this act...about the restaurant being in bad shape and all that. He can't make the payments...I don't know what to make of it. He says Groppi's run off with a girl. I could help if you want.
No...his business is bad. But I'll decide what to do and you...and you just keep out of anything that might...might...er draw attention to you.
Take a drink!
Ok.
Hey, where you been?
Oh...around...why?
Oh...around...why?
You heard what happened to GROPPI, eh?
Who me? ...No, I don't know, not me...all I know is...
Our friend, Groppi, went to his mother's house. And when he was there...at night...
I really couldn't believe it when you told me, you know that?
Well, he was always a little crazy... he puts a gun in his mouth... ...like your friend...comme si chiama...Henning? Heming?
Well, he was always a little crazy... he puts a gun in his mouth... ...like your friend...comme si chiama...Henning? Heming?
Hemmingway. Killed himself. I was more upset about that than about Groppi, that's for sure.
Hemmingway. Killed himself. I was more upset about that than about Groppi, that's for sure.
You know, this boy over here, once, long time ago, tried to enrich my mind...so he gives me a book by this Hemin fella...to read, so I read it.
Oh yes, he's pretty good.
What I don't understand is why you have to go to college to read these books that you're gonna read anyway.
...but it's the same thing, all the same...they're in there by having something on somebody...and when that doesn't work...they fight...Our life has honor...we have no show to put on because we do what we have to do. They know where to come when they need us. I realize this during the war...World War II...Vito Genovese... during WWII he worked with the government, taking care
What did he do?
His whole family has problems...his cousin, the girl who lives next door to you...
Teresa.
Teresa.
...The one who's sick, right? In the head.
No, she's got epilepsy.
Yeah. That's what I said, sick in the head.
Her mother and father come to me and ask advice...she wants to leave...get her own apartment...worries them sick...what am I gonna tell them? Lock her up?
What do they expect you to say?
What do they expect you to say?
Who knows? It's not hard to figure out what she'll wind up like. When the respect for parents breaks down, that's bad...you know I'm "cumpari" with them...so I take an interest. You live next door, keep an eye open...but don't get involved.

All right.
Well, maybe you missed something?
Oh yeah, that's a possibility.
Wasn't a book...was a short story.
What was it?
What was it?
Nothing.
Nothing.
No, c'mon...Y'know, I read.
No, c'mon...Y'know, I read.
"Francis Macomber."
"Francis Macomber."
Wha?
Wha?
"Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber."
"Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber."
Oh yeah...didn't read it but I saw the movie...Gregory Peck...pretty good.
It's only a couple of courses...just for the draft.
Charlie, couple of courses isn't enough to get you student deferred... I mean if they wanted to draft you, you would've been drafted by now.
Why don't you take a look around the place if you want?
Oh, that's ok...I've been in and out of this place fifty times.
I'd like to eat something before I go back to work.
Ok, we'll go for lunch.
Ok, we'll go for lunch.
Do you have enough?
Well...with the hotel that's ten... fifteen...
Here.
Please take it.
Well...
Well...
I don't mind.
Sure...it's not that...I mean...
It's all right.
It's all right.
Well, if things go the way I hope they'll go, this money business will take care of itself. God willing.

What is it now?
What is it now?
Don't ask.
Alright... Hey, did you hear any more about what happened last night?
Did you?
Did you?
No.
No.
CHRIST, you should have seen it. Unbelievable. The kid would turn around and fire and he would just keep coming at him like Rasputin. That kid was scared. Not half as much as we were though.
CHRIST, you should have seen it. Unbelievable. The kid would turn around and fire and he would just keep coming at him like Rasputin. That kid was scared. Not half as much as we were though.
It doesn't make any sense. He wouldn't shoot him just because he insulted a racket guy...not unless it was personal.
It doesn't make any sense. He wouldn't shoot him just because he insulted a racket guy...not unless it was personal.
You missed the point. The kid's a climber...not very bright...but if you get down to his level to look at it his way; he kills a guy who insulted a big man - he gets a reputation. He thinks he's in good standing.

It's still sick.
It's still sick.
Not sick...just stupid. Speaking of stupid, your cousin last night was feeling so good he decided to break into your mother's house...to get some food.
C'mon Charlie...one more day. I'll call in sick for work.
No...we can come back in a couple of weeks. Besides, if we're both gone for three days it wouldn't look right.
No...we can come back in a couple of weeks. Besides, if we're both gone for three days it wouldn't look right.

See that...know who lives there? The name George Earhardt mean anything to you?
Sure...He lives there?

I can take care of myself. You know that.
I can take care of myself. You know that.
I know...I know.

Ummmmmmmmmmmmm.

Of all people. Now say the truth. Do I look like Che Guevara. C'mon.

Teresa?...Yeah, Charlie. Listen, I'm looking for your cousin. Yeah, well today's Tuesday, payday. I haven't seen him all day...no...well, have you got any idea where he is? I know it's early yet but I'm just getting worried that's all...
Charlie...I've got to see you. I want to talk...
Charlie...I've got to see you. I want to talk...
Honey, I can't talk now...I've gotta run, bye.
Honey, I can't talk now...I've gotta run, bye.
But...

That's your name?
And isn't it a lovely one? So sturdy, so straight --
...We're never all together two nights in a row. Maybe Christmas, Thanksgiving, that's it. What's going on?

Unfortunately. I sat between them at the Bronx Zoo benefit -- it was better than Seconal.

Just plain 'Joe'?
Love that name.
That was 'Joe'.
He's cute.

Fireworks. Update -- we're con- structing the number '65' on the barge, archers from the State College at New Paltz will shoot flaming arrows at it, when it catches fire it will give us the effect of a Viking funeral with none of the morbidity... The Hudson River Authority says, for you, they'll make a special dispensation - of course there'll be an overtime

From La Rosette, only the greatest pastry chef in America. This is orange, from real Seville oranges. Lemon, on a mille-feuille crust, a little on the fanciful. And a while, nothing like a good old white cake, vanilla, with Angel food but some maroons shavings thrown in.

Hi, Daddy, what do you think?
It's starting to grow on me. But what do the 'B' and 'P' mean?

The fountain is the Caspian Sea and the Sea is serving up caviar. The 'B's for Beluga, the 'P' for Petrossian. Of course, they also stand for 'Bill' and for 'Parrish'.

-- Plus we've got a baritone with a balalaika coming from The Russian Tea Room. I've dressed him in a Cossack shirt and he'll sing Nelson Eddy songs.
I do it because I love you. Because everybody I loved you. Mommy -- wher- ever she is -- Susan, Quince, the people who work for you, everybody who's ever known you.
Yeah? And what about my enemies?
Yeah? And what about my enemies?
They respect you. Isn't that a kind of love?
I haven't been the father to you that --
That you've been to Susan?
That you've been to Susan?
I wasn't going to say --
I wasn't going to say --
But that's what you were thinking. And that's okay. Because I know you love me. Not like it is with Susan, the way your eyes light up when she comes in the room and the way she always gets a laugh out of you, as opposed to me when I walk in a room and that look comes over your face, "What does she
You know, darling, this is going to be a wonderful party.
Yes, it is.
Honey, please.
Okay. All aboard - New York, New York!
Okay. All aboard - New York, New York!
Remember everybody, tonight, dinner in the city at Daddy's. You too, Drew. We've still got some loose ends --
What about the Mayor?
He said he would be there with bells on.
Please don't be negative, Drew, we have an acceptance list that would do The White House proud -- The Secretary-General of the UN, the Chairman of the FCC, nine Senators, I don't know how many Congressmen, and at least twelve of the Fortune '500'.
No jocks? A twenty-game winner or a Masters champion? Someone I could talk to. Or would talk to me.
Paillarde of veal.
Yeah, they hit the calf over the head with a mallet and then Luisa hits it again in the kitchen.

Pinot Grigio. We're considering it for the appetizer.
What do you do that for?
Well sir, it's 9:30 in the morning.
Well sir, it's 9:30 in the morning.
9:30's almost 10:30. Where I come from, the sun's over the yardarm, m'boy, and the cocktail lamp is lit.
I'm afraid this is a wine bar, Mr. Quince.
Okay, give me a bottle of wine.
Okay, give me a bottle of wine.
Red or white?
Red or white?
Both.
Bill, thanks for coming over... And how're you doing today, Drew? You've got a firecracker here, the kid's really set the table.
Good, good. Glad to hear it.

I thought you were buying my company.
I thought you were buying my company.
Oh, Mr. Parrish, I could never buy Parrish Communications. I could pay for it, of course, but it would always have your imprint.
Yes, sir?
Hello. I'm Joe Black. Nice to meet you.
Hello. I'm Joe Black. Nice to meet you.
Yes sir, Mr. Black, a pleasure.
What are you eating.
You mean this, sir?
'Laura Scudder's Peanut Butter'. You like it?
I would say, sir, it is right up there with Jif and Skippy. But miles ahead of Peter Pan. Like a taste?
I would prefer some peanut butter.
How would you like that, sir? On some kind of toast?
How would you like that, sir? On some kind of toast?
Toast? No...just the butter.

Right away.
Hello, Beautiful.
Hi.
-- Did I hear 'business'?
What 'business'?
...See you tomorrow night.
Include me out. I've had enough of the conversations.

That may be. But I don't like the fucker. I don't like the way he looks at you and talks to you. And vice versa.

Sorry, but I like the way he looks and talks to me. And vice versa. Okay?
Sorry, but I like the way he looks and talks to me. And vice versa. Okay?
No, not okay. I thought we had a good thing going here. It shows you never know.
Well... goodnight.
Yeah. Goodnight.
Oh, you're the great Joe's attorney now? Are we going to go to court? Or are we going to go to bed? And I don't mean you and me. I mean you and him.
That's it. It's over. Get out.
That's it. It's over. Get out.
So I guess a blowjob's out of the question?
And what would that be?
Bill's birthday is the day after tomorrow. There is a provisory by- law in our charter. Per the discre- tion of the Board, Corporate off- icers can be retired at age sixty- five.

You're taking this too far, Drew.
You're taking this too far, Drew.
Am I not obligated to?
Thank you for coming.
Hello, Quince.
We're not getting anywhere here. Why don't we take some of the best out of this thing, let's consider it coolly, let's take a week --
Bontecou wants a speedier response than that.

We have an arrangement now.
What side of the industry did you say you were on?

I didn't say.

Joe sounds like a ringer, Bill. I have the feeling you guys got the broad strokes already. Need any help with the details?
Incidentally, Joe, where're you staying?
Here...
Here...
'Here'?
Nice to see you. I didn't expect you, but certainly you can't get enough of a good thing.
Thank you.
Thank you.

Anything else, Mr. Black? How about some water?
Why yes, thank you.
Why yes, thank you.
Hot or cold.

Of whom?

It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter.
Then why did you bring it up?
May I interrupting?
Yes.
No.
Well, I'm going to tell you anyway. I did cheat on that exam at Groton. But so did twenty-six other guys, and nobody ever mentioned it until today. And I'm expecting you won't mention it again. I don't know who you are and where you're getting your information, but I'm willing to pretend I did not hear it, and let bygones be bygones. But
Who are we talking about?
But I know she's grateful for the care you're giving her.

Is this a state secret or are we being excluded just for the fun of it?
Is this a state secret or are we being excluded just for the fun of it?
Susan's patient is whom we are talking about.
Perhaps you could remind me.
I'll make a note of it. Anything else?
No, I don't --
Not good, not bad, you know what we got? Nothing. No credit, no cars, no mortgages -- no wives. Nothing.
So tell me, tell me, I'm peeing in my pants.
-- And now you're going to pee some more.
I'm not stepping anywhere --
I appreciate your gentlemanliness, Bill, but what we need to do here is drive the dagger home --

Good morning, Drew. Thanks for coming out.
Well, it's a big day. Wanted to line up a few ducks before kickoff. Any thoughts? Last minute refine- ments or variations?

A voice?

In my sleep.
In my sleep.
What'd it say?
What'd it say?
'Yes'.
'Yes'.
'Yes' to the deal?
'Yes' to the deal?
Maybe, who knows? You know how voices are. Let's go.
I was saying to Quince we won't need --
Did you just hear something?
Did you just hear something?
Why yes, Bill, I was saying to Quince --
Why yes, Bill, I was saying to Quince --
No no, not you.
...Tomorrow we sign off -- photo opportunity, you and Big John, it'll lead network news. Okay so far?
Sounds good.
Sounds good.
It's going to be great --
It's going to be great --
Do you think I need a haircut?
Do you think I need a haircut?
Bill, after this deal, you'll be able to afford one.
Our first annual report, must be thirty-five years ago now, I owned two stations, I wrote down a state- ment of purpose, that one day you would wake up to a Parrish radio station, read a Parrish paper at breakfast, catch our news on tele- vision during the day, and go to bed with one of our books or magazines and you would always
That's great! Wait 'til I show it to Bontecou.
I'm all excited --
Me, too.
Me, too.
I thought it was great, I thought you and Big John would be like a couple of bulls in a china shop -- Instead it was --

You have a way with words.
So... Board convenes tomorrow, you'll recommend, we close and it's a deal, right?
As close as a deal could be.
As close as a deal could be.
Olympic.
Yeah, something he goes by --
Oh, excuse me. This is -- uh -- this is --
Sorry...um - you - you know it's gone right out of my head --
What?!
'Joe...'
Yes.
Yes.
Is there any more to it?
Is there any more to it?
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
Like 'Smith' or 'Jones --'
Have we met?
Uh -- he's from out of town --
No --
I get the feeling you've done some business before.
...Sounds like you're not leaving much room for discussion.
Sorry. I know it looks like I'm reversing my field.
Sorry. I know it looks like I'm reversing my field.
That's your privilege, Bill. But given our needs, given the absolute necessity for growth, given the fu- ture, the truth is... joining John Bontecou is every bit as certain as - Death and Taxes.
You're not familiar with the phrase, "In this world, nothing is certain but Death and Taxes"?
I am now.
I am now.
Glad I could be of some help.
Shall we adjourn?
But the matter's still on the table, Bill --
No.
'Just kidding'?
'Just kidding'?
Sit down, Drew.
Sit down, Drew.
Before I do -- I was hoping we might be alone, Bill.
Before I do -- I was hoping we might be alone, Bill.
Joe and I have no secrets from each other.
Joe and I have no secrets from each other.
How nice for you both.
Why?
I was hired, you told me, to help bring Parrish Communications into the 21st Century. This merger is the vehicle --
Joe, cut it out. And you too, Drew.
I thought this was practically a done deal --
I thought this was practically a done deal --
Well now it's undone, okay? Forget Bontecou! Scrub him! I'm tired of his fancy name and his fancy offer. I'm not going for it.
I was a little abrupt with you this afternoon, Drew. Forgive me. I want you to know I value your advice.
As much as Joe's?
You're competitive soul, Drew. That's what makes you a great addi- tion to the money. Joe is just... around.
For how long? And why?
For how long? And why?
Please. Don't worry about him. And above all, don't antagonize him.
Mind if I throw up?
Please, Drew.
I have to go, Bill -- it's been a helluva day. Need a few minutes to sort everything out.
Okay, we'll see you tomorrow.
Okay, we'll see you tomorrow.
Sure.
What is there to say? They know what John Bontecou is -- and if they didn't, they know now.
Yes, you made your feeling abun- dantly clear. Now they want to do the same with theirs.
Yes, you made your feeling abun- dantly clear. Now they want to do the same with theirs.
What are their feelings?

If I read this Board right now, they want you to accept Bontecou's offer.

Over my dead body.
What do you think the Board is going to say when I tell them that?
I don't care.
I don't care.
With all due respect, you damn well better care because if you try to stonewall them again, there'll be blood on the floor.
Whose?
Yours.
Yours.
I'm feeling real uncomfortable right now because the guy who reports to me is threatening me.
I'm feeling real uncomfortable right now because the guy who reports to me is threatening me.
I'm just giving you the truth. There was a time when William Parrish liked the truth.
I think it's time you went home, Drew.
Certainly. Goodnight.
Did you want to have a cup of coffee or something, Bill?
I don't think so. Do you?
That's it?
Bontecou wants a quick response and --

The answer is no, quick enough for you?

Don't you want to hear the details?
Don't you want to hear the details?
I'm not interested in the details. And I'm not interested in the big picture either. What I am inter- ersted in is how my Board got conven- ed behind my back, is entertaining a further proposal from a man whom it offends me to do business with, moreover has the audacity to present this to me like a prize fish, and I am expected

Certainly, Bill.
Certainly, Bill.
Are you running this Board or am I?
I've already introduced Mr. Black to you all.
But who is he? What are his creden- tials? What is his relationship to you?
In English, please.
Mandatory retirement upon our Chairman's sixty-fifth birthday.
I don't know where you get that idea -- the Board agreed --
The Board didn't know you're a mole who burrowed inside so you could bury us all.
The Board didn't know you're a mole who burrowed inside so you could bury us all.
Is this Mr. Black's fantasy? Another one of his whoppers? Aren't you sick of this asshole lurking around? No one knows who he is, but one thing everyone does know, he somehow got your ear and has been pouring poison into it ever since.
I think I'd like to talk to my lawyer --
No lawyers, Drew. We're going to offer you a deal.
And what do I get?
You get not to go to jail.
You get not to go to jail.
You're talking through your hat. You're offering a deal because you've got no proof.
You're talking through your hat. You're offering a deal because you've got no proof.
Proof? We've got plenty of proof.
Hey, this is it, the hour approach- es, I'm getting all excited. So what do you think, is it -- -- just the 'Executive Committee' or could you guys use me?
Quince, m'man, thanks for the offer, but it's all set for just me and Bill. More people might --
Quince, m'man, thanks for the offer, but it's all set for just me and Bill. More people might --
I know. Gum up the works.
You're overthinking it --
I don't think they're ordinary. I love keychains.
Well, I guess he's found one.
Joe, you do get around.
...I know you're down, but you know when you're down, Drew, there's no place to go but up.
Thanks, Quince.
Thanks, Quince.
Never mind Bontecou. I've got some other merger possibilities up my sleeve, and I'm putting them to see old man.
Never mind Bontecou. I've got some other merger possibilities up my sleeve, and I'm putting them to see old man.
Are you?
Are you?
We'll do it together. I'll clue you in. Timing's got to be right. The old man says it's up to Joe.

Yeah.
Yeah.
'It's up to Joe', huh?
'It's up to Joe', huh?
Yeah, that's what he said.
Yeah, that's what he said.
Well, that's very interesting.
I thought so, too. Joe's a neat guy.
Yeah. Neat.
I'd like to come, too. See Susan strut her stuff.
You're on, Quin-cee. Destination Hospital. Joe, you'll be the Tour Guide. Okay? How's that sound to you?
Well, I'm happy to tell you I've got good news. As I was telling Drew, I've been making a little hay while the Bontecou sun was shining -- two, possibly three new and boiling hot prospects for merger.
How did Bill react to the leads you've developed?

'It's up to Joe'?
'It's up to Joe'?
That's what he said.
What have you done? You've gotten the old man fired!
That we did. Thanks to you. He was wobbling, mind you, but you spplied the coup de grace.
I'm going to put a stop to this!
Quince, you can't unscramble scrambled eggs.
Quince, you can't unscramble scrambled eggs.
But I didn't mean to do it!
But I didn't mean to do it!
The train's left the station, pal, and you're aboard. Would you like to hear the silver lining? Check that, gold. I've been working with John Bontecou all along. We had a game plan -- acquire Parrish Communications then break it apart and peddle it piece-by-piece to the highest bidder. I set it up for him, he smacks it out of the park.
I don't want to get rich this way -- I'm going to expose you.
Go right ahead. Tell William Parrish how you betrayed him at a secret Board meeting. And tell Allison how you got her father fired -- and he lost his company.
This is damn big of Bill, I also think it's smart.
He had no choice. You're a formidable adversary.
He had no choice. You're a formidable adversary.

Yes?

You bet. I'm king of my Rotisserie League.
You bet. I'm king of my Rotisserie League.
Are you?
How long you here, Joe?
As long as it takes.
Black.
Hey, this is fun.
Don't bother asking, we already tried.
It's so very nice to see you again.
That's very gracious of you, Quince.
No problem. I'll leave you two alone. I can tell you guys have something on the fire --
Cirrhosis of the liver is the fifth leading killer of adult Western males.
I didn't know that.
I didn't know that.
On the other hand, Winston Churchill drank a bottle of cognac a day and lived until he was ninety-one.
You're an original, Joe. A little hard to figure, maybe...
And you're a nice man, Quince.
And you're a nice man, Quince.
Thanks.
Thanks.
You're welcome.
C'mon, have a drink. You look like you need one bad as me.
Do I? I'm a little confused.

I was a world-class loser and she was a happy, little rich girl -- and for some reason she took me in.

What do you mean 'free'?
What do you mean 'free'?
Free to love each other. Com- pletely. Totally. No fear.
Oh yes, you are one of my favorites.
What would you say if you knew it was me who brought down Bill Parrish? I told Drew and the Board that Bill depended on you. Drew led me on, but I had no business telling him in the first place. He was setting up Bill from day one. Drew and Bontecou are going to chop up the company and sell it off for
You think so? How do you know?
Because that's the kind of man Bill Parrish is.
Do you think I should wait to tell him 'till after the party?
No.
What are you doing here?
I'm lost.
I'm lost.

Not the one I met this morning, hit- ting on me in as nice a way as I've been hit on in a long time, but the moment you find out I'm my Dad's daughter, you act like a stranger.
Not the one I met this morning, hit- ting on me in as nice a way as I've been hit on in a long time, but the moment you find out I'm my Dad's daughter, you act like a stranger.
That is not my intention.
What are your intentions? To make little dreams in coffee shops, turn a woman's head, and I don't mind admitting it was turned, I liked it, but ten hours later I feel like a fool. I don't get it. You, my father, here in this house, the cof- fee shop, it's making me upset, and I don't like being upset. Who are you anyway?
Peanut butter.
You act like you never had peanut butter before --
I haven't.
I haven't.

When you put your mouth to his, Susan, it seems a frequent thing.

Drew is none of your damn business. Nor is where I put my mouth.

I'm sorry. Do you live here?

No, Joe, I'm swimming here. Then I'm going home.

I guess what I'm trying to say is -- I'd like us to be friends.

I don't have any.
I don't have any.
I can see why.
Yes --?
I have a certain function to per- form, and that seems to take all of my time. Bu sometimes - uh - I speculate - uh - I haven't left room for - uh - anything else.

Susan?
Yes?
Yes?
Did you know you have a wet spot on your shoulder?
Goodnight, Joe.
Goodnight to you, Susan.
Yes?
I think you want to go to the west wing. Through there.
Joe --
How nice you look. Is that your uniform?
Oh goodness, no.
Then why are you here, Joe?

I came to see you.

I don't have any time to see you now. I'm doing grand rounds and then I'm examining back-to-back patients until dinner and then --

Very well, I'll watch.

That's impossible. I'm a doctor, I'm --

And I'll be a visitor.

I don't mind --
She's in a great deal of pain.
Yes.
Joe, I'm with Drew.
Not now.
I have to go, I'm sorry to say --
Be sorry for nothing.
I wanted to apologize, Susan --
I thought you said 'Be sorry for nothing'.
I thought you said 'Be sorry for nothing'.
Well, now I am sorry. For intruding on you this afternoon.

It wasn't an intrusion. And if it was, it turned out to be welcome.

And I appreciate you, too.
Why do you love peanut butter so much?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I adore things like that....food I can't do without. Don't you?
Yes...
It comforts you, doesn't it?
It comforts you, doesn't it?
Yes...I've found that it does.
I'm very concerned about the woman you attended to today.
I am, too.

Has her pain abated?

We're doing what we can for her. But it doesn't look good.
We're doing what we can for her. But it doesn't look good.
I'm sorry to hear that.
How long have you been standing there?
I don't like the way Drew spoken to you. But I feel better about it now because of the way you spoke back.
Why?
Because guys who never say anything about themselves are always married.
No, I'm not.
Girlfriend?
Girlfriend?
No.
No.
Gay?
Gay?
No.
Where are you going?
To bed.

'To bed'?
'To bed'?
Yes. I'm tired.
You first.
Why don't you get off his case?
Almost.
I said get out.
I'm sorry about --
Please. We don't need to talk about Drew.
I love your smell.
-- I guess you haven't.
Thank you.
It was everything.
-- Could you?
Never tried, 'til now. Joe, may I kiss you?
Never tried, 'til now. Joe, may I kiss you?
Why, yes. Thank you.
Yes?
I don't know who you are.
I don't know who you are.
Well...I'm -- uh, Joe. And you're Susan. And I - uh - have this weak feeling in my knees --
Well...I'm -- uh, Joe. And you're Susan. And I - uh - have this weak feeling in my knees --
And is your heart beating strangely?
And is your heart beating strangely?
Faster. And I want the scent from underneath your ears and the taste of your lips and the touch of your tongue to stay with me -- forever.
You're here?
I am.
I just thought I'd drop by, scrounge a little lunch, I was in the neigh- borhood --
How beautiful.
He's taking a nap.
He must be tired -- this Bontecou thing --
He must be tired -- this Bontecou thing --
Yes, he's tired. I believe so.
...No.
Maybe it's the draft through the door.
Did you like making love to me?
I loved it.
I loved it.
More than you love peanut butter?
More than you love peanut butter?
Yes!
Where are you going?
Nowhere? I'm...here.
Nowhere? I'm...here.
For how long?
For how long?
Oh, I hope a long, long time.
I like you in a black tie.
I love you in an evening gown.
I love you in an evening gown.
It beats a surgical, doesn't it?
Yes. Your father and I, our time together has come to an end.
Where are you going?
Well -- I --
And you can't tell me who you are.
I can tell you the when part. Tonight.
It gets worse.
It gets worse.
No worse than it gets for me. I'm in love with a woman whom I don't want to leave.

We know so little about each other --

But there's so much to tell you --

Don't. That will come later.
Don't. That will come later.
Will it?
Will it?
Lightning struck. We caught it in a bottle. Don't let it out. I want to be with you, Joe --
What will we do?
'Love will find out the way'.
'Love will find out the way'.
'Love will find out the way'?
'Love will find out the way'?
It's a saying.
It's a saying.
I believe that, don't you?
I believe that, don't you?
Yes, that's why I said it.
Did I say that?
And I said you'd have a hard time finding a woman like that.
The 'coffee shop' --
-- That was the place... and you were the guy.
I - uh --
You want me to wait for you, you'll be back --
I'm still here.
But you're not. You're somewhere else. You're someone else --
Tell me you love me -- tell me you love me now --
I love you now, I'll love you always --
I love you now, I'll love you always --
Hold me --
Susan --
-- Yes?
-- Yes?
Thank you for loving me.
That's it?
Well, I don't know what else to say. It's a helluva party --
Well, I don't know what else to say. It's a helluva party --
You think so?
You think so?
Yeah...and you're the prettier thing here.
No --
Joe knows what you're saying, just being polite --
Joe, that's the kitchen.
Thank you.
...I'm sorry, I'm a little discon- certed, that stuff between you and Susan -- uh -- threw me.
'Threw' you? Where?
'Threw' you? Where?
Shook me up. I mean that you knew her and everything --
Shook me up. I mean that you knew her and everything --
I didn't know her. The body I took knew her. The man she met in the coffee shop this morning. I - uh - took him.

So there's nothing between you and Susan?

No.
No.
I wish you had said something to me about staying here --
I wish you had said something to me about staying here --
It hadn't occurred to me until then. I was just having such a wonderful time -- Besides, isn't this what I'm here for?
What a good idea.
Thank you. Would you like the man's name?
Thank you. Would you like the man's name?
No.
If there is anything else, don't hesitate --
I won't.
I won't.
How long have I got?
How long have I got?
You're putting me on the spot, Bill.
When you go, I go.
That's the best I can do. ...but minute-by-minute, I find myself lingering.
That's the best I can do. ...but minute-by-minute, I find myself lingering.
...I just saw my doctor, he told me everything was fine.
...I just saw my doctor, he told me everything was fine.
Your doctor? Did your doctor say anything about a tiny, undetectable hole in your aorta? Did he mention an irreparab- ly weak vein in the further reaches of your famous brain? Were there any prognostications about the possibil- ilites of a fatal collision on a golf cart or suffocating in an avalanche on a ski vacation in Gstaad?

No --
No --
I hope you realize, Bill...in your office this morning, that was your time.

Closer than that.
Well, thank you for letting me know.
Not at all.

And - uh - I guess, 'goodnight'.

Good night to you, Bill.
Good morning.

How are you? How're you feeling?
How are you? How're you feeling?
'Feeling'? I feel fine. How do you feel?

Um -- well, I didn't sleep too well. This is crazy. This is the left- field thing of all time. What do I do? What do I tell my family?
Um -- well, I didn't sleep too well. This is crazy. This is the left- field thing of all time. What do I do? What do I tell my family?
Oh, I wouldn't tell them anything, Bill. You'll ruin the good start we had last night. I felt as if I were being treated like a person. 'Joe' this and 'Joe' that - a nice smile - Quince passed me the rolls -- no 'rapture' or 'passion' or any of those mighty things you seem so intent on imparting, but I am cer- tain,
And what?
And I won't tell anyone who you are.
And I won't tell anyone who you are.
Sounds fair enough.
Sounds fair enough.
It is a deal?
It is a deal?
A 'deal'?
A 'deal'?
You give your word, I give mine -- that we'll do what we say. It's a truth exchanged between two people.
Bill --
Yes?
Yes?
You've got a deal.
When you were shaving this morning, you weren't just shaving, right?
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
You were hatching ideas, making plans, arriving at decisions, right?
You were hatching ideas, making plans, arriving at decisions, right?
I guess so.

So you understand the concept then. When you're busy here, your work, what your task is, is being executed elsewhere.

Of course.

So you've grasped the idea. Con- gratulations. Now multiply it by infinity and take it to the depth of forever, and you still will have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about.
Joe --?
Yes, Bill.
Yes, Bill.
How about giving a guy a break?

Make an exception?

There's one to every rule.

Not this.

That's what everybody says.

I'm not everybody.

I want to live.
I understand.
What's it like?
What do you mean?

What's it like where I'm going?

Can you keep a secret?
Can you keep a secret?
Yes.
Yes.
So can I.
Perhaps you would like to wait in my office --?
No.
No.
What I'm trying to say is this is a Board meeting and you are not a mem- ber of the Board.
What I'm trying to say is this is a Board meeting and you are not a mem- ber of the Board.
I'm sure you'll see to it that it won't be a problem.
Would you like to sit down, Joe?
Yes.
-- What's the deal here? Are you going to be breathing down my neck right 'til the very end?
I don't understand.
...I'd like to be alone for a while.
Are you sad, Bill?
Are you sad, Bill?
Yes, I am. There's a research lib- rary on the fourth floor. Why don't you go down and read some magazines?
Yes, I am. There's a research lib- rary on the fourth floor. Why don't you go down and read some magazines?
You're not thinking of going some- where, are you, Bill?

Joe, could I ask you to take a walk? Buy a tie or something. I know I'll be seeing you.
Joe, could I ask you to take a walk? Buy a tie or something. I know I'll be seeing you.
Of course.
Now I'd like to be alone.
Oh. Okay.
Jennifer, give Mr. Black a map of the city.
No thank you, Bill. I can manage.
Are you going to eat your lunch
It's all yours.
Excellent. What is it?
Cold lamb sandwich with cilantro. A little Coleman's mustard.
Truly - uh - splendid.
Glad you like it. My wife turned me onto cold lamb sandwiches. Joan -- that was my wife --
Glad you like it. My wife turned me onto cold lamb sandwiches. Joan -- that was my wife --
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Cold lamb sandwiches -- not as chewy as roast beef, not as boring as chicken. She knew stuff like that.
And more.
Why didn't you stop me?
Why didn't you stop me?
Well...I don't know.
I thought you'd heard a trillion times --
This part I'm interested in.
Dinner? Absolutely.
Absolutely.
Why, at this juncture, are you letting yourself be so concerned by business matters?
I don't want anybody buying up my life's work and turning it into something it wasn't meant to be. A man wants to leave something behind. And he wants it left behind the way he made it. And he wants it to be run the way he run it -- with a sense of honor, of dedication, of truth. Okay?

Easy, Bill. You'll give yourself a heart attack and ruin my vacation.
Why did you go to the hospital?
I don't know.
I don't know.
You were just curious?

I wouldn't put it that way.
I wouldn't put it that way.
What way would you put it?

You tell me, Bill.
You tell me, Bill.
How about you telling me? When I ask a simple question, I expect a straight answer. That's what I'm used to. Anybody who doesn't give it to me, I fire.

Um -- not right now.
Okay. Goodnight.

I'm sorry, Bill --
That's okay.
That's okay.
What's okay?
What's okay?
Just a manner of speaking.
What 'okay' is, it's 'okay' it's over. We've got bigger fish to fry, don't we, Joe?
'Fish'?
'Fish'?
Never mind. I'm tired. I'm going to take a nap.
I'm not hungry.
Then I can't help you.
I couldn't sleep.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Yes, I saw you see me.
Well, you're at the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong woman.

I'll be the judge of that.

I'm her father!

With all due respect, Bill, I'm not asking your permission.
With all due respect, Bill, I'm not asking your permission.
Well, you goddam well should. You walk into my life, give me the worst news a guy can get, have me dancing on the heads of pins with my busi- ness and with my family, and now you're spooning with my daughter.

'Spooning'?
'Spooning'?
Yes, and stop repeating everything I say, and turning it into a question. Spooning, fooling around, God knows what. You arrive on the scene -- why you picked me, I still don't under- stand --

I picked you for your verve, your excellence, and for your ability to - how shall I say - instruct. You've lived a first-rate life. And I find it eminently usable.
You're violating the laws of the universe.
This universe?

Any universe that exists or ever existed. You may be the pro, Joe. But I know who you are. And you're all fucked up.

What are you saying, that it's time to go?
You are?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Good. Tomorrow, after the party.
Thanks.
Not at all.
What the hell do you care?
I was just asking, Bill.
I was just asking, Bill.
You 'want to know', I'll tell you. You're looking at a man who tonight is not about to walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death, he's galloping into it. And the same time, the business he built with his own hands and his own head is being commandeered by a couple of cheap pirates. And, oh yes, I almost forgot, my daughter's

Say again?
Say again?
I'm in love with your daughter, and I'm taking her with me tonight.
You're what?
I think you heard me, Bill.
I think you heard me, Bill.
You're not taking Susan anywhere. And what the hell does that mean anyway?
I'm sorry, Bill --
Susan is my daughter, she has a wonderful life ahead of her and you're going to deprive her of it and you're telling me you're sorry? Well, I'm sorry, apology not accepted.
Susan is my daughter, she has a wonderful life ahead of her and you're going to deprive her of it and you're telling me you're sorry? Well, I'm sorry, apology not accepted.

Well, they're mine now.
Susan wants to come. She says she's in love with me.
With you?! Who is 'you'? Did you tell her who you are?
With you?! Who is 'you'? Did you tell her who you are?
No.
No.
Does she know where she's going?
I don't like what you're saying.
I don't expect you to.
I don't expect you to.
Are you threatening me?
Are you threatening me?
I certainly hope so -- I loved Susan from the moment she was born, and I love her now, and every minute in between, and what I dream of is a man who will discover her and she will discover a man who will love her, who is worthy of her, who is of this world, of this time and has the grace and

The Treasury Department asked my cooperation in his undercover investigation of John Bontecou. They were convinced that Bontecou, on past deals, had structured his mergers and acquisitions in sus- picious and complicated ways so as to evade paying the taxes he is liable for. The IRS wanted to go after him, and this deal offered them the opportunity. I agreed to cooperate.
And we're very grateful.
And we're very grateful.

That's life. What can I tell you?
Am I dreaming this? Are you a dream?
I am not a dream.
I am not a dream.
You're coming to 'take me'. What is that? Who the hell are you?
You are --?
'...Yes --'
Yes.
Death!
Death!
That's me.
That's me.
You're not Death. You're just a kid in a jacket and a pair of pants.
You're not Death. You're just a kid in a jacket and a pair of pants.
The jacket and the pair of pants came with the body I took. Let me ask your opinion. Do I blend in?
You want me to be your guide --?
You fill the bill, Bill.
You fill the bill, Bill.
I do? How long will you be staying?
I do? How long will you be staying?
You should hope quite a while.
You should hope quite a while.
And then --?
This is crazy -- you're not going to eat dinner with us.
Bill, I am eating dinner with you. And your family. And that's what we're doing. It's not open for discussion. Nothing is. Don't you understand?
Excuse me? Could I say something?
Of course.
Of course.
It just occurred to me --

What are you talking about?
What you were talking about.
Are you giving me orders?
I'm sorry, I --
I'm sorry, I --
No, you're not. You're trying to 'handle' the situation but this is the one situation you knew you never could handle.
Where are you? Are you there?
It's enough now.
It's enough now.
Please. Talk to me --

There's going to be plenty of time for that.

The man from whose lips fall 'rapture' and 'passion' and 'obses- sion'...all those admonitions about being 'deliberately happy', what there is no sense 'living your life without...', all the sparks and energy you give off, the rosy advice you dispense in round, pear-shaped tones --
What the hell is this? Who are you?
What the hell is this? Who are you?
Just think of millenniums multiplied by aeons compounded by infinity, I've been around that long, but it's only recently that your affairs here have piqued my interest. Call it boredom, the natural curiosity of me, the most lasting and significant element in existence has come to see you.
About what?
I want to have a look around before I take you.

Bontecou Day. Going to close with Big John -- Look at you, Bill, all cool as a cat and over at Bontecou's, I'll bet he's shitting in his pants.
...I read you all the way on the Bontecou thing, and I know where you're coming from. And I'm with you a hundred and one percent.
Thank you, Quince.
Thank you, Quince.
But I've got to tell you, if mergers are in the wild, I've got some great prospects I've developed. I want to talk to you about them next week.

Next week?
Next week?
Yeah. Or the week after.
No, anything is possible. It's up to Joe.
Joe, you don't know how glad I am you're aboard. Anybody who can take some of the weight off the old man, I'm in his corner.
This is great, honey. The orange. Has it got a little vodka in it? Like that Finnish stuff, orange vodka -- Put your lips around this one, Bill. It's out of this world.
No thank you, Quince. I'm sorry, honey. I'm no good at this. Why don't you choose whatever cake you like?
But he does give a shit. Don't you, Bill?
Yeah, I give a shit.
Yeah, I give a shit.
See. There. What'd I tell you?
This one.
The vodka. What'd I tell you?
...what can I say after I say that I'm sorry? I zipped when I should've zagged, I opened my big mouth one too many times, everything got all twisted --
It's okay, Quince. I understand. You've always meant well and I appreciate that. Sometimes things just turn out -- wrong.
Come in, Joe -- I want to thank you -- okay, Bill?
Sure.
Joe knew the whole story. I told him. It was his idea that I come clean. I mean I wanted to come clean but he gave me a pair of balls, you know what I mean?
Yes, I believe I do.
All in all, what Bill wants to do is build the golden bridge to Drew with no hard feelings.
You think Drew will go for it?
You think Drew will go for it?
Quince, I've got confidence in you.
Quince, I've got confidence in you.
Sir, I'll deliver the package.

But we want you back, Bill. Mean- while, enjoy your party, celebrate, we'll attend to the nasty details. And Mr. Black, may we say thank you.
Good morning, Dad.
Hi, honey.
Drew's aboard?
He wanted to ride back down with you. Now sit and relax, get some- thing in that flat tummy of yours --
Will you relax? I know it is a big deal day --
How did you know?
How did you know?
Drew told me.
Drew told me.
Does Drew tell you everything?

I hope so.
I hope so.
You like him, don't you?

Yeah. I guess so.
I don't like to interfere.

Not my birthday again?
You're only six-five once.
You're only six-five once.
Thank God. Now could we go? Let's get this day started.
I thought you were in a meeting--?
I am. With you.
...There's a start for a meeting.
I know it's none of my business --
Do you love Drew?
You mean like you loved Mom?
You mean like you loved Mom?
Forget about me and Mom -- are you going to marry him?
Forget about me and Mom -- are you going to marry him?
Probably.
Don't get carried away.

Susan, you're a hell of a woman. You've got a great career, you're beautiful --

Listen, I'm crazy about the guy -- He's smart, he's aggressive, he could carry Parrish Communications into the 21st century and me along with it.

That's for me. I'm talking about you. It's not so much what you say about Drew, it's what you don't say.
That's for me. I'm talking about you. It's not so much what you say about Drew, it's what you don't say.
You're not listening --

Oh yes, I am. Not an ounce of excitement, not a whisper of a thrill, this relationship has all the passion of a pair of titmice.

Be deliriously happy. Or at least leave yourself open to be.
Be deliriously happy. Or at least leave yourself open to be.
'Be deliriously happy'. I'm going to do my upmost --
I know it's a cornball thing but love is passion, obsession, someone you can't live without. If you don't start with that, what are you going to end up with? I say fall head over heels. Find someone you can love like crazy and who'll love you the same way back. And how do you find him? Forget your head and listen to your

I'm sorry. But give it to me again. The short version.
I'm sorry. But give it to me again. The short version.
Stay open. Who knows? Lightning could strike.
I won't. And when I tell Drew about it, he won't either.
You won't tell him, and even if you did, he'd clock it and punch it into his laptop in order to pull out some key phrases when he gives the Commencement Speech at Wharton.

Thank God.
He doesn't care. But thanks anyway.
Daddy, what's the matter?
Nothing. I'm sorry.
What is it, Daddy --?
Nothing.
Are you okay?

We've met.
We've met.
What?!
What?!
-- This morning. The Corinth Coffee Shop. He was looking for a doctor.
Uh - will that hold you, Joe?
Incidentally, 'Joe' what?
Funny, I don't get that feeling. Maybe it's because you found out I'm Bill Parrish's daughter.
Cut it out, Susan. You and I've got to talk. Big day tomorrow, everybody. Joe, let's go.
It'll come back, Daddy.
Will it?...
That was wonderful.
Yeah, it's good to get together.

Do you mind if I raise a little caution flag?

Raise away.

What is the nature of your interest in Joe?
What is the nature of your interest in Joe?
Well, remember how you told me about "lightning striking"? The nature of it's in there somewhere.
I won't say you may be getting onto shaken ground --
Then what will you say?
Then what will you say?
I don't think this is the lightning you are looking for. Drew's a good man. I know I didn't seem to be completely in his corner before, but I've come to appreciate --

It's something.
Where's Joe?
Joe?
Where is he?
I don't know.
Because I was sitting in a staff meeting, incredibly bored, my mind kept wandering and the only place it landed was -- Joe.
I don't understand.
I don't understand.
Love. Passion. Obsession, all those things you told me to wait for. Well, they've arrived.
This is crazy --
Why? A man appears at your side, almost never leaves it, you clearly trust him, depend on him, I sense you value him deeply, why aren't those things good enough for me?

You don't know anything about Joe --
You don't know anything about Joe --
What are you afraid of, Dad? That I'll fall head over heels for Joe -- well, I have -- as you did with Mom. That's always been standard, whether you like or not.
Susan, I don't think Joe is going to be with us long.
Where's he going?
Where's he going?
I don't know, I can't say --
I don't know, I can't say --
C'mon! The guy's working with you. You always know chapter and verse about everyone who works --
C'mon! The guy's working with you. You always know chapter and verse about everyone who works --
In this case, I can't. I - uh -- I just can't help you. I only would tell you -- that with Joe, you are on very, very dangerous ground.
I love him.
I don't care if you love him! I'm telling you he's no good for you!
What a night.
I'm having a helluva time.
You were right about Joe, he is going somewhere --
I'm sorry.
Are you relieved?
Yes, but --
But what?
I want you to know how much I love you. That you've given a meaning to my life that I had no right to expect, and that no one can ever take from me.

Daddy --

No -- I love you so much and I want you to promise me something. I don't want you to ever worry about me. If anything should happen, I'm going to be fine and everything's going to be all right. -- And I have no regrets.
I love you, Daddy --
That's why it's okay.
I'm still here. Would you like to dance with me, Susan?
Oh, yes --
If you don't mind dancing with an old fogey like me.
Oh, Dad, you're not old. You'll never be old.
What was that?
The fireworks are about to start.
Good morning, I was talking kind of loud there, sorry.
Not at all. It was fascinating.

I'm not trying to sharpshoot you, but that 'nothing lasts' stuff, that's what was the trouble with Honey's guy. He was fooling around and Honey caught him at it. One girlfriend wasn't enough for him.

I've been thinking... I don't want you to be my doctor. Because I don't want you to examine me.
Why?
Why?
Because I like you so much. You have coffee here every morning, don't you? If I came by, could you give me the name of a doctor?
Sure, I'll give you the name of a doctor. ...And I don't want to examine you.
Why not?

He is fine. And we know the jokes. When it gets vengeful, things get messy. When they get messy the wrong people die... Everybody gets it.
Good.
Okay. What'd you spot...?

They knew about Alonzo, <u>before</u> he made a move on them. They had our operation. They've cut into us.
You need to consider a few issues.
...you'd be operating outside territorial United States. Your badges do not count. You have no authorization to carry weapons. If you're busted, it could take a long time to get you re-patriated. And there's no backup... And you will share with them all your intel on Montoya...

Maybe. Maybe with the crazy whites.
If they attack you...
...it's gonna be an L-shaped ambush. They're not gonna open up until they got the party favors, 'cause all they'd get is a lot of police scrambling to a gunfight. They <u>will</u> wait till they got the goods before they do the deed.
What are you going to do with me? Are you taking me to jail? You think I will turn into your informant, is that it?

You afraid of violence?
I am not John Wayne. There is no "S" on his chest. We get down if the play calls for it. But we are into business and making money.
Red light, green light, José?
I'm also called "Cochi Loco." That means "Crazy pig." 'Cause I enforce security and get people to tell me what I need to know. That part of what I do, you never want to find out about. Other people will negotiate the money and go or not go. Not me...

Here's what this is...ask how much they want to turn back to us our load...
Packaging?
Fifty-gallon drums. Thirty-two. A hundred kilos in each. You transship that to the Malaysian boat.
Yeah?
Hey, Captain Kirk. I think maybe I have second thoughts.
You got something to say, José, let's hear it.
I confess I have succumbed to my weaknesses. An inability to see another's point of view. I've discussed it with professionals. Even with one of your friends. She's here now...
What friend?
Mrs. Rico. But don't worry. She is safe. To insure that, I am keeping her close to me. It's always good to keep people your friends care about close to you.
Proof of life. How do I know Mrs. Rico's alive?

White gangs...? It doesn't track.
White gangs is tweakers and a crystal meth lab in a trailer park. Bounce around the old lady Saturday night and get your recidivist ass busted back...
Aryan brothers are not going to change-up suppliers. So...
Transpo? How they bringing the loads in...?
Track with me, here... They knew the "Russians" were undercover Feeb? They should have no-showed. But, no, these guys show anyway, and commit murder upon federal officers. And steal all your money... What does that say to you?
It says, "We do not fear you." It says, "Fuck off and die." It says, "We get down for recreation..."
So?
We could try to run loads into these guys. Run a few loads for Montoya into South Florida. Into this group.
And we didn't come down here to audition. Business auditions for us... ...and know who we are and know they want their load run by us <u>before</u> Nicholas calls.
That way we do not waste AvGas or our motherfucking time.
People gonna walk into this place and say, "Ola, hijo! That some crazy wallpaper. Whew...it wild! Is that a Jackson Pollack?"
"No, viejo. That was José Yero, splattered all over his motherfucking wall."
"No, viejo. That was José Yero, splattered all over his motherfucking wall."
So we can close each other's eyes right now. Real easy. Real fast. But, then, nobody makes any money...
And specialize in very fast go-fast boats for coastal runs.
What kind of weight?
The people on shore who handle a load we run are our people, not your people. No tweakers, dopers, first- timers we don't know. They didn't do time with us, they ain't doing crime with us.
What <u>you</u> get <u>from</u> us is a date. A place. "In the parking lot of a Jack-in-the-Box in north Miami." At such-and-such time, an eighteen- wheeler will be there. Keys in the ignition. Ready to roll. You pick it up. And you drive it... ...away.

C'mon, man!
We think NLR. We don't know! Alonzo only fronted as a broker for our guys to make the meet. He wasn't deep into the crew.
Break your encryption? Hack your e- mail? Employee databases? Somebody on the inside?
We don't know. And that's the point. Maybe there's a mole. Whatever, it's a disaster. And it's a Joint Interagency Task Force. I have DEA, ATF, U.S. Customs components in on it.

They got a steady stream of supply. So, no...
Who are you talking to?
He's talking to you, bro. What he means to say is he is reluctant to abandon the penetration of a major narcotrafficking organization...
So?
Switek pulling this off...? That's not faith; that's delusional...
Only African he ever "relocated" was a $2,000-an-hour Nigerian model for Gucci, and he got wounded when she took an NBA draft choice to the Super Bowl instead of him...
He did volunteer one time...
What am I supposed to do after I get my nails and hair done...?
Reality TV and stay by the phone. That's what all wives-in-crime do...
You okay?
Yeah.
Yeah.
You sure?
You sure?
Yes. What's up?
Yes. What's up?
Nothing. Calling to say hi... What's up with you?
Nothing. Calling to say hi... What's up with you?
Bored.
Okay...see you soon.
...and thanks for the flowers.
...and thanks for the flowers.
What flowers?
What flowers?
The bouquet, here. Five-hundred dollars worth of roses...yellow.
You mean with the flowers...?
What's it say?
What's it say?
"Salutations from the south..."
Okay.
Good idea. We'll grab a bite.
...the lease, the phones, the cars...layers of false ident. Would take the FBI weeks. How long did it take them? Three hours? Four? This means, "We can reach out and touch somebody." Like Bad Teleflora.
...even if they could run the identities you built to EPIC, all they'll find is more cover... Trust what you built. It's quality, girl. We're cool...
...even if they could run the identities you built to EPIC, all they'll find is more cover... Trust what you built. It's quality, girl. We're cool...
...you are trying to reassure me because you know when people get anxious, they make mistakes. You're worried about me. Do not be. I am careful. I am cool. I got Trudy, backup, whatever. You worry about you. Because you are the ones who are in denied territory, not me. If your focus is on me, you'll miss something coming at you. That's how
...and we're looking at Nigerian crude...
Precursor shipments from Ras Tanura and Ju'aymah?

Transshipped to a Malaysian container ship.

They've been targeted. And Pakistani registry is too vulnerable to search and seizure right now.
They've been targeted. And Pakistani registry is too vulnerable to search and seizure right now.
José doesn't like the deal in South Florida...
Burnett? They want 22% of the value on loads they run into South Florida. It's the Juarez cartel model. They guarantee the loads. The upside is our risk goes to zero. That frees-up capital.
But what does your intuition tell you...?
And...?
They're serious. They're cautious. They'll forgo a deal over a technicality of how a delivery's handled...they'd walk away, rather than compromise operational security...that's good.
Why?
A good deal, like this with us, for Burnett will be good only temporarily. He'll get restless because he believes nothing is forever. Life is dust, make it while you can. He's ambitious.
I think José suspects anybody he doesn't intimidate. And people, who are good at what they do? They have egos, too...
What would you do...?
What would you do...?
I like the diminished risk. It frees up capital reserves. I like working with self-interested businessmen who are competent. You can predict their behavior....
I run down the numbers. Nothing is very negotiable. Small loads? We pay three thousand a ki. We pay your fuel costs up front plus ten percent. The next ten percent on U.S. landfall.
Define small.
Define small.
Two, three thousand a ki. Two thousand ki's, your end is $6,000,000. Complex transshipments or dealing with containers, these have front- loaded costs we pickup. For this kind of weight, the balance of 80% is when our buyer picks up the load. Transactions are offshore. Dollars or euros. Secure internet transfers. We have lists of Cayman and Isle of Man banks infiltrated by IRS,
And as an investment in the future...
"Future" of...?
Conveyance?
Maritime. Jose will fill you in.
That sonofabitch!
You set this up!
You set this up!
Of course! That is why I placed myself here, with you, knowing Yero would pull this crap.
It's all bullshit. Jesus is out of communication in Fals de Iguazu. José knows that... Whatever he's going to do, he has to do it fast because he's acting on his own. And he will need a story.
Meaning...?
Meaning...?
They will kill you. And then they will kill your wife, too.
So lay it out, my brother...
Nicholas said you okay. That's nice. But how I know if you any good?
Equipment?
Slow and low, Adam A-500s... ...carbon composite, stealthy, 1400 nautical-mile range, thousand ki payload...all the way to Caravels and 727's from a source country to a transshipment point. Small freighters. We've done containers...
And violence is extra. And expensive. So how much weight you looking to move?
Nothing. 'Cause how you do delivery on the beach, I don't like. Maybe this does not work.
What do you care?
Do we need this...?
Then what were we talking to you for?
I had to lay eyes on you.
What do I care what you think about how he looks? You wanna fuck my partner or do business?
Wait by the phone. You get a call. Or maybe you don't. Until then, piss off back to where you come from...
This the load you lost a while back?
It is. He try to take tonight's load?
I walk into Neptune's house...very nice. But I also see you... and our drugs that got ripped from Maguda.
You don't like us finding your load? We can go and lose it all over again...
Transshipment point is here at 17:00 hours on the 23rd.
Uh-uh. No predetermined places and times to meet. Give me their heading and radio codes and I will talk to them directly with the longs and lats and time which will be a last minute deal...
Uh-uh. No predetermined places and times to meet. Give me their heading and radio codes and I will talk to them directly with the longs and lats and time which will be a last minute deal...
<u>You</u> give <u>yours</u> to me. <u>We</u> position all the assets hauling our loads...
Importation value? At twenty-two thousand a ki...
You work that out with La Senora. You will get sixteen fuel bladders of crystal meth precursors from the Malaysian ship. For collection in North Miami. You warehouse it. Release it when we say. I'm sure you have friends with fast boats...
What the hell did you do?
The Feeb gig was I front a coupla undercover, Russian-speakers to them. One's ATF. And broker the deal. Set up the meet with the NLR types...
I gotta, I gotta go...!
Alonzo...
Alonzo...
What...?
What...?
Alonzo, you don't need to go home.
They said they wouldn't hurt them, wouldn't hurt them if...
They lied.
Beg pardon, ma'am. I'm brand spanking new to this town, come from Houston, Texas, and hoping to get a look at the Statue of Liberty...
You're hoping to get a look at what?
You're hoping to get a look at what?
The Statue of Liberty.
The Statue of Liberty.
It's up in Central Park, taking a leak. If you hurry, you'll make the supper show. Now get lost.
Don't know what line Morey's in, but myself now, fact is -- I'm a hustler.
Hers'n zodda meg a livig.

You sure you heard what I said?

Scuse me, hon, fraid I'm only half here. Maybe you oughta run on along. But why don't you take this phone number?
You're such a doll. I hate money, don't you? God, it's been fun.
Funny thing, you mentioning money. I was just about to ask your for some...
You ain't coming to work?
Don't guess. Just come for my day's pay owing and to tell you I'm heading East.
What you gonna do back there, East?
Lotta rich women back there...
Lotta rich women back there...
Yeah?
Yeah?
Men, they mostly faggots.

I got me two hundred twenty-four bucks of flat folding money... He know what he can do with that chicken-shit day's pay. And if he ain't man enough to do it for himself, I be happy to oblige!
Were you looking? About the Statue of Liberty?
Joking? No, ma'am. Oh no! I mean business!
Joking? No, ma'am. Oh no! I mean business!
I'm sorry. I thought you were -- never mind -- I've never actually been there, but let me see, you take the Seventh Avenue subway, I think, to the end of the line...
I'm sorry. I thought you were -- never mind -- I've never actually been there, but let me see, you take the Seventh Avenue subway, I think, to the end of the line...
You sure are a pretty lady.
You're not looking for the Statue of Liberty at all.
No, ma'am, I'm not.
No, ma'am, I'm not.
Why, that's perfectly dreadful. Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
I can tell, can't you?
Yeah, oh yeah.
Yeah, oh yeah.
What'll we do? Leave now or what? Your place or mine? Oh God, the second I looked at you I knew. Did you?
He's got taxi fare.
Sure you're all right?
Well, that's something never happened to me before, you can bet your bottom dollar. Uh, where's the matches, ma'am?
Top drawer. Maybe if you didn't call me ma'am, things would work out better.
You think I'm lying!
No. Of course not. Just something struck me funny...
Maybe we should take a little nap, see what happens?
I ain't sleepy.
I ain't sleepy.
I know. Scribbage!
That's pretty Freudian, Joe.
What? It's a perfectly good word, ain't it. How much time I got? Goddam sand thing drive you crazy. Kee-rist. Spelling never was a very strong point with me. Even in school.
What? It's a perfectly good word, ain't it. How much time I got? Goddam sand thing drive you crazy. Kee-rist. Spelling never was a very strong point with me. Even in school.
If you didn't talk so much, maybe you could think more.
If you didn't talk so much, maybe you could think more.
Talking helps. Don't talk, you get muddled in your head. Hey! Now you just look at this here!
There's an E in MONEY. If that's your word.
M-O-N-Y -- I'm right! That's just exactly how they spell it up there on that big building, bet you could see it from here. M-O-N-Y.

Okay. Never argue with a man.
Okay. Never argue with a man.
Y -- what in hell starts with Y?

You gonna beat me, Joe?

Beat your butt, you don't lemme think!
Beat your butt, you don't lemme think!
Gay ends in Y. Fey. You like that -- gay fey -- is that your problem?
Gay ends in Y. Fey. You like that -- gay fey -- is that your problem?
I show you what problem --
That is one hell of a shirt. I bet you paid a pretty price for it, am I right?
Oh, it ain't cheap. I mean, yeah, I'd say this was an all right shirt. Don't like to, uh, you know, have a lot of cheap stuff on my back.
Shee-it... Kee-rist, you really know the ropes. Wish to hell I bumped into you before. I'm Joe Buck from Texas and I'm gonna buy you a drink, what do you say to that?
Enrico Rizzo from the Bronx. Don't mind if I do.
Enrico Rizzo from the Bronx. Don't mind if I do.
Same all around! For my friend, too!
... you see what I'm getting at here? She got a penthouse up there with color TV and more goddam diamonds than an archbishop and she busts out bawling when I ask for money!
For what?
For what?
For money.
For money.
For money for what?
For money for what?
I'm a hustler, hell, didn't you know that?
I'm a hustler, hell, didn't you know that?
How would I know? You gotta tell a person these things A hustler? Picking up trade on the street like that -- baby, believe me -- you need management.
How would I know? You gotta tell a person these things A hustler? Picking up trade on the street like that -- baby, believe me -- you need management.
I think you just put your finger on it, I do.
I think you just put your finger on it, I do.
My friend O'Daniel. That's who you need. Operates the biggest stable in town. In the whole goddam metropolitan area. A stud like you - paying! -- not that I blame you -- a dame starts crying, I cut my heart for her...
Hey, listen, how about you take me to mee this Mister O'Diddle bird right now?
Well, Joe, you're a nice guy, and I'd be doing you both a favor, but why? What'm I dragging my bum leg all over town for? It's no picnic and what for, for me myself, what?
Tomorrow when some piece like that's scratching your back in a Fifth Avenue townhouse, where'll your pal Rizzo be? Nedicks.
Hold it, just hold it. You think I'm that kinda sombitch? Just name your cut, whatever you want, you got it right now. Five? Ten, how's that?
Let's see how you look. Fine. You look fine. Now I'm gonna have to have that other ten...
Ten, ten -- I got a twenty -- take that...
Ten, ten -- I got a twenty -- take that...
Oh hell, forget it.
Oh hell, forget it.
Now take it. Go on. Listen, where can I reach you? Cause I'm gonna make this right with you soon's I get me set up...
Now take it. Go on. Listen, where can I reach you? Cause I'm gonna make this right with you soon's I get me set up...
Forget it.
Forget it.
I mean, dammit, where you live?
What's in your socks?
Not a cent, I swear to God, I swear on my mother's eyes.
You keep the sixty-four cents. I want you to have it.
It's sticky. What you do, slobber on 'em? I wouldn't touch 'em.
You want some free medical advice, shut your goddam mouth about that night.
Okay, right, right, okay. Another subject. Where you living? Still at the hotel?
Listen, keep away from me, hear? You come near me again, I snatch you bald-headed!
I'm inviting you. I mean if you're not located, I got a place. I'm inviting you, goddamit.
I'm inviting you. I mean if you're not located, I got a place. I'm inviting you, goddamit.
You inviting shee-it.
Smart thing for me to do is haul ass outta here.
Whatsa matter now?
You don't seem like no fag...
What's that supposed to mean?
What for?
So you could sleep! I mean Christ!
I drug in a cot, if you want to stay.
Well now, Ratso, I'm gonna tell you something for your own good, only first gimme a cigarette.
You want me to stay here tonight, is that the idea?
I ain't forcing you, like, I mean, who's forcing you?
I ain't forcing you, like, I mean, who's forcing you?
Oh. Guess I got the wrong impression.
I want you to stay, okay? I goddam invited you, didn't I?
Well, I hope you know what you're in for. I'm a very dangerous person. Someone does me bad like you. If I caught up with you that night, there'd be one dead Ratso long about now. Hear?
Well, I hope you know what you're in for. I'm a very dangerous person. Someone does me bad like you. If I caught up with you that night, there'd be one dead Ratso long about now. Hear?
I'm impressed. You're a killer.
I'm impressed. You're a killer.
So if you want me to hang around for a few days, I thought you should know.
Joe -- do me one favor -- this is my place, am I wrong? You know, in my own place my name ain't Ratso. I mean it so happens my name is Enrico Salvatore Rizzo.
Shee-it, man, I can't say all that.
Shee-it, man, I can't say all that.
Rico then, at least call me Rico in my own goddam place.
Rico then, at least call me Rico in my own goddam place.
Rico! Rico! Rico! Is that enough? And keep your meat hooks off my radio.
The two basic items necessary to sustain life are sunshine and coconut milk. That's a known fact. If I can find the goddam hole the milk squirts out.
This is an okay setup you got here, but I'd say you ain't just exactly, uh, flush, is that right or not?
This is an okay setup you got here, but I'd say you ain't just exactly, uh, flush, is that right or not?
I been sick. Hold this, will ya?
In Florida, they come smooth, ready to eat. Down there, your only problem is, diet-wise, you gotta lift an arm to wipe warm milk off your chin. Tough, hey?
I think finding you's the smartest thing I ever did, for both of us. You just the crooked kinda sneaky little sidewinder I need to get me hustling in this town. Hey!
Miami Beach is the only place for a real hustler. Florida has more rich chicks per square yard than any resort spot in the world. They lie out in their pagodas and pergolas waiting to grab the first jockstrap that passes.
What's all this sweet talk about Florida? Your friend O'Daniel got a stable down there now?
Look at yourself, Joe, no offense, but frankly, you're beginning to smell. For a stud in this town that's a handicap.
You talk like a man with a tin twat.
You ain't got a chance in hell. You need threads and glitter, baby. A front, hey?
Well, uh, my manager's gonna manage all that crap, or else he gonna get a coconut up his flue.
Hey, you're good! I bet you could pick up a living at this if you tried.
And end up a hunchback like my old man? You think I'm crippled? You shoulda caught him the end of a day.
Kee-rist, you pretty damn clever for a skimpy little gimp.
You like it? Take a look.
You like it? Take a look.
Don't rush me. How I do it, see, I get myself primed, like I was turning on the charm for some pretty little blonde lady, then kinda mosey away slow and easy and - swing around! -- and there you are, you handsome devil.
Not bad -- for a cowboy -- you're okay, you're okay.
What I'm gonna do, I'm gonna make a cowboy outta you, kid. How about that? Build you up a little, teach you couple little tricks'n turn y'out to stud, Rat-stuff.
Shee-it. Cough yourself inside out, then light a fag, a goddam fag. You make me puke. Where'd you steal it? In the movies?
The coat? A guy I did a favor once gave it to me. Christ.
The coat? A guy I did a favor once gave it to me. Christ.
Who'd you ever do a favor for? You just let some poor bastard freeze to death, wouldn't you?
Where'd that come from?
Forty-second Street. Where'n hell you think it come from?
Forty-second Street. Where'n hell you think it come from?
You wanna know the truth? You dumb bastard, I got it for you. Look at it. Goddam thing's ten sizes too big for me.
Kee-rist, you sure are one twisty little bastard, Ratso.
The name's Rico, at my own father's grave, a man deserves some respect.
The name's Rico, at my own father's grave, a man deserves some respect.
Respect shee-it! You even steal flowers for his grave.
Respect shee-it! You even steal flowers for his grave.
Can he smell the difference, eh?
Well, uh, he dam well know he ain't 'be-loved Aunt Winifred'.
He can't read. Even dumber than you. Couldn't write his own name. X -- that's what it ought to say there on that goddam headstone. One big lousy X like our flat. Condemned. By order of City Hall.
Well, this thought just struck me. It wasn't too long ago I was washing dishes way the hell somewhere in Texas.
Yeah, well, so?
Yeah, well, so?
Now I'm here. I'm in New York City. Getting picked for things. Don't you see what I'm driving at?
Now I'm here. I'm in New York City. Getting picked for things. Don't you see what I'm driving at?
What you're driving at, you want me to get lost so you can go to your fancy-ass party.
What you're driving at, you want me to get lost so you can go to your fancy-ass party.
Did I say that? Did I? It don't say nothing about you...
Did I say that? Did I? It don't say nothing about you...
Don't say nothing about you either.
Don't say nothing about you either.
But they picked me, right? So what I'll do, I'll just say, now look, you want me? Well, I don't go nowhere without my buddy here.
But they picked me, right? So what I'll do, I'll just say, now look, you want me? Well, I don't go nowhere without my buddy here.
Well, what the hell, I got nothing better to do.
You got a comb?
Don't need a comb.
Don't need a comb.
Few dozen cooties won't kill me, don't guess.
Well, I made it. This here is Ratso Rizzo and I...
Rico. Rico Rizzo.
Tell her, Ratso.
Twenty bucks...
Well, if you're awright, why you hanging on the bannister. Can you walk or not?
Walk? Naturally I can walk.
They wrong?
No. But while you was buying the underwear, I could have lifted the socks.
No. But while you was buying the underwear, I could have lifted the socks.
You couldn't lift fly specks from a sugar bowl. Can you hold this?
But thanks. Hey, Joe, don't get sore about this or anything. You promise?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, I don't think I can walk. I mean, I been falling down a lot and, uh...
Well, I don't think I can walk. I mean, I been falling down a lot and, uh...
And what?
And what?
I'm scared.
I'm scared.
What of?
What of?
What'll happen. I mean what they do to, you know, do with you -- if you can't -- ah, Christ!
What'll happen. I mean what they do to, you know, do with you -- if you can't -- ah, Christ!
Who?
Who?
I don't know. Cops. Or the -- how should I know?
Okay. Here it is. You gonna go see the doctor. I got nine bucks and twenty more Thursday and I gonna be riding high before you know it. So you gonna get you the best goddam doctor in this town and get yourself straightened out, that's what.
No doctors. No, sir. Not me. Doctors are like goddam auto mechanics. Fix one-thing, unplug another. Operate for piles and while they're there, they unscrew your liver. My old man, for God's sake, wasn't any sicker'n I am when he went to the doctor.

Just when everything's going my way, you gotta pull a stunt like this.
Just when everything's going my way, you gotta pull a stunt like this.
I don't even want you to go. Whaddya think of that? I got other plans for my life than dragging around some dumb cowboy that thinks he's God's gift to women. One twenty-buck trick and he's already the biggest stud in New York City. It's laughable.
These guys're good drivers.
They gotta be.
They gotta be.
Yeah.
You get your first palm tree in South Carolina.
How'n hell a dumb Bronx kid like you know that?
How'n hell a dumb Bronx kid like you know that?
I read it.
I read it.
Shee-it. You believe all you read?
If you have to shiver, why don't you pull the blanket up more?
I been thinking. I hope we're not gonna have a lotta trouble about my name down there. Because like what's the whole point of this trip anyway?
I been thinking. I hope we're not gonna have a lotta trouble about my name down there. Because like what's the whole point of this trip anyway?
Keep the goddam blanket on.
Keep the goddam blanket on.
I mean New York's one thing, but can you see this guy, imagine it, running around the goddam beach all suntan and he's going in swimming, like, and then somebody yells 'Hey, Ratso' -- how does that sound to you?
I mean New York's one thing, but can you see this guy, imagine it, running around the goddam beach all suntan and he's going in swimming, like, and then somebody yells 'Hey, Ratso' -- how does that sound to you?
Sounds like they knew you.
Sounds like they knew you.
Sounds like crap, admit it. And I'm not gonna have it. I'm Rico all the time, okay, do you blame me? That's agreed, okay? We're gonna tell all these new people my name's Rico?
Hey -- whatsa matter?
I'm wet.
I'm wet.
You're what?
You're what?
I wet my pants! My seat's all wet.
I wet my pants! My seat's all wet.
Hell, don't cry about it!
Hell, don't cry about it!
Here I am going to Florida and my leg hurts, my butt hurts, my chest hurts, my face hurts, and like that ain't enough, I gotta pee all over myself.
I'm falling apart, that's funny?
You just -- just -- what happened, you just had a little rest stop wasn't on the schedule.
Hey, what the hell you doing?
I'm zipping your fly, what the hell you think I'm doing?
Thanks, Joe.
Shee-it, you know, I got this thing all figured out, Ratso. I mean Rico. When we get to Miami, what I'll do, I'll go to work. I gotta do that, 'cause see, I ain't no kind of a hustler. I ain't even any goddam good as a bum. I'm a nothing, that's what I am. So reckon I'd better go to work and get
A drink? I've got some nice gin. If you'd prefer something else, they'll send it up...
Gin's okay.
Gin's okay.
It's so exciting. New York. The mad forward thrust of everything. My sense of time here is completely altered.
Sometimes it seems to me time stopped twenty years ago. There was this war, there was this handsome young man with quite black hair and he was supposed to die. But he didn't. Isn't that amusing?
What?
What d'you want?
What?
What?
What you got me up here for?
What you got me up here for?
Oh, difficult, it's so difficult. You're a nice person, Joe -- I should never have asked you up -- a lovely person. Oh, how I loathe life. I loathe it. Please go. Please.
Oh, difficult, it's so difficult. You're a nice person, Joe -- I should never have asked you up -- a lovely person. Oh, how I loathe life. I loathe it. Please go. Please.
You want me to leave?
You want me to leave?
No, yes. No, I mean yes please go. Help me to be good. Come back tomorrow. Promise.
No, yes. No, I mean yes please go. Help me to be good. Come back tomorrow. Promise.
I'm going to Florida.
I'm going to Florida.
This is terrible. I meet someone who -- then -- wait, I want to give you a present. For your trip. You'll let me please...
Listen, I gotta have money.
Oh. Yes. Of course. I should have thought. You shouldn't have to ask. That was thoughtless of me. Yes. Wait here...
Here. Don't even thank me.
I gotta have more'n ten. I gotta have fifty-seven dollars.
I gotta have more'n ten. I gotta have fifty-seven dollars.
I simply don't have it, Joe.
I simply don't have it, Joe.
Get outta my way.
Get outta my way.
You're wasting your time. There's nothing in there.
Am I tickled to find you, boy! Come on in and let's get a look at you. Turn around. Good strong back. You'll need it. So you want help -- take a seat, relax, tell me about yourself. Cowboy, huh?
No sir, I'm no cowboy really, but I'm a first class stud.

Yeah, what do you think this is, the good USA? This is Turkey, man... ) It's a fucking accident here if you're innocent. And anyway... ...ain't nobody who's innocent.
Tunnel?
It's already built! There's a basement substructure where they used to keep weapons and stuff, but beneath that there's these old catacombs that the Christians built 'bout a thousand fucking years ago to bury their dead. We're sitting right on top of it -- here.
Hey! I'm getting this together man and I don't need no fucking Gastro-head along on this trip! We go through the wall.
We go through the wall?
You got that, shit face? Asina...

They went out over there: must be some kind of exit.
Who?
Ziat!
To what?
The prison, man. There was this German cat an architect in the hospital. He was helping the Turks build some shit round the place. I laid some bread on him and he let me copy them.
Too bad you didn't have a machine.
There's two ways out I figger - over the roof, but that's only one person, maybe two. The other way is Under.
Gotta be here someplace. Thought I heard a couple of dead Christians singing down there.
Stop shitting me, man!
--the water like "'weeps" through the cement, see. Twenty, thirty years, you can almost push it over. All we do is use Gastrohead's screwdriver here and scrape the mortar out. Pull out 2, 3 stones, squeeze through, put 'em back, and get our ass down the shaft, It's a two night operation, maybe three.
And what do you do when you in the catacombs?
And what do you do when you in the catacombs?
The catacoombs? Whaddya want, a door? There's miles of em like a sewer system but they got to come up someplace in Istanbul.
Hey, you know what's gonna get us out of here? It's not a map, Max. It's our balls. You know what I mean... ...I gotta get laid man, I don't know 'bout you guys, but if I don't get it on soon, I'm... I'm not gonna make it.

Same. None of the neighbors know. We told them you were in a hospital in Europe. Oh... this is Stanley Davis. He's the American Consul here... And Necdit Yesil, the lawyer you wanted...
Right! That's what we're shooting for. Mister Davis and have been in contact with the State Department, but right now relations with the Turks aren't too good, Nixon's upset the hell out of them. Our best bet's... right here.
Dad... I'll pay you back for all this, I Promise.
Dad... I'll pay you back for all this, I Promise.

Four planes in four days...but I guess you kids don't read the newspapers...and what with our people kicking up a shit storm 'bout the flow of heroin from Turkey you got...
But didn't have heroin.
Well, you see Billy, it don't really matter right now if it's 2 kilos or 200 kilos. The Turks love to catch any foreigner smuggling - it shows the world they're fighting the drug trade.
But just...

Jeez, she used to say I was the lucky one.
Let's hope so, Billy. Let's sure hope so.
How's it feel?
About as good as it looks.
Just Erich.
I'm Billy Hayes... At least I used to be.
Feeling all right?
Yeah. That guy who beat me? I feel stoned.
New people sometimes get on his nerves.

And you?
Hashish. Ninety percent of the foreigners are in for hashish.
What they give you?
Twelve years.
How much did you have?
A hundred grams.
A hundred grams.
It's not fair!
There is no fair in Turkey, Billy. It's all "sula-bula" like this, like that. An Italian hippie had a car accident and a Turk was killed. SO, they threw him in here for six months...
That doesn't seem so bad.
That doesn't seem so bad.
But he was eating lunch a mile away when the Turk smashed into killed himself.

Section 13?
Yeah, for the criminally insane. I was there once for two weeks and it ain't an illusion. It's awful. Namidou runs it like a death camp, that's where he spends most of his time...

Someone'd have to go to the switchroom, pull the coupling lever, that'll send us left and to the elevator.
You gonna finally get to fuck around with the wires. Think you can handle it?
Depends. You got a memo?

Hell, I might be able to juice the whole area, if I can get to the power box. It's just a couple of cables...
It would take a minute or so. You won't last that long out there.
Peter, you couldn't even fix our TV!
He didn't do it!
What?
What?
Manny never threw the coupling switch!! We're goin' the wrong way!!!
Which way?

Who know? We get lucky, maybe a couple of 'em'll be ours.
We're down to a "couple" now, huh?
You know where they get this fertility stuff? They extract it from the urine of menopausal Italian nuns.
Monks bottle their own wine. Don't they?
You were the one who ran around with ice in his underwear, don't forget that.
Don't get kinky here...
Okay, meet me out front. I gotta go. Josh's picking me up in five. see you tonight.
I'll be late.
Thought it was my week for that.
I needed to think. It was either this or the weather channel.
This thing was the size of my fist, Peter!! That's off the charts!
Okay. So you lost a great specimen-
Okay. So you lost a great specimen-
Don't you get it? It's more than that.
Evolution doesn't work that fast. Something pushed that thing to take the leap. We need to find another specimen.
We?
Keep going. We'll tell you when to stop...
Maybe they lied to you.
Maybe they lied to you.
Even if they did... that's all we have, isn't it?
Metaxonycha Godmani.
So?
Honey, just leave it.
No, there's...
You give someone a fucking uniform and... Did you hear how he talked to us?
I heard how you talked to him.
I heard how you talked to him.
Oh, so I'm the bad guy now?
He was just doing his job.
Fine, then I'm the bad guy. Jesus!
Great crowd.
No such thing, baby.
I get the feeling they came more for the potroast than the apterids.
Fuck 'em. They don't know what they're missing.
Fuck 'em. They don't know what they're missing.
Right.
Oh, no, you were-
I was just late.
Ironic, don't you think? These guys can hatch hundreds of offspring in a single clutch of eggs, right? And here we are...
Susan, we're not b-
...you don't even know what you're looking for.
You said that thing was big as your hand. I don't think I'm going to miss...
You said that thing was big as your hand. I don't think I'm going to miss...
Why take the chance? Just let me go down there with you...
Why take the chance? Just let me go down there with you...
No.
Susan, listen to me: you handled that insect almost as much as Siri...
It didn't bite me.
It didn't bite me.
I know. But if it was carrying something...there's a chance you could have been exposed.
It's me. Can you hear me?
Yeah, barely. We haven't found anything down here. Nothing...
Don't.
Listen to me: we're getting you out.
No, Jesus, no.
Toss the flare down!
So, you're saying this is like those bugs that -- that look like twigs or leaves or...
That's camouflage...
His blood! It's driving them crazy! We have to mask the odor!
How?!
It's no use! They know we're in here!
They don't know anything Peter, they just sense. They're hardwired!
They don't know anything Peter, they just sense. They're hardwired!
Right. Hardwired to eat anything that's not like them!
Rub it on the windows!
What-
What-
Just do it!!
We'll cover ourselves with this. They can mimic us- we Goddam mimic them!
Peter-
Peter-
It worked before...
It worked before...
The scent won't last...
The scent won't last...
That's why we should do it now.
Don't touch it. And for Godsakes, try not to sweat. They can sense chemical changes...
Try not to sweat?
I was just thinking how I could use a pair of pliers... and I remembered where they are...
That's it. That's it. Breathe easy.
Oh, come on, come on!
Jump in.
You go first. I'll be right below you.
Your arm, you can't...
Your arm, you can't...
I can. We can do this...
C'mon...
Ah...
Ah...
Talk to me.
Talk to me.
Peter...
No...
We can do it!
Hello.
You the bug lady, right?
You guys have done a nice job. How bout five dollars?
That's it?
You sure you didn't see one of these?
Gross. What is it?
Gross. What is it?
An "Ootheca". An eggcase. It probably had more, uh "weirdbugs" inside.
An "Ootheca". An eggcase. It probably had more, uh "weirdbugs" inside.
No way. I see one of those, I'd puke.
Siri, sandblast that thing. It looks like Trump Tower. Those mounds are supposed to be made of dirt and excretions...
Just like Trump Tower, then.
...as long as they're ready for the opening I don't care, just tell them that.
I'm on it. Don't worry. Look, Susan...I don't mean to pry, but... I kinda overheard you and Peter.
I'm on it. Don't worry. Look, Susan...I don't mean to pry, but... I kinda overheard you and Peter.
Watch your step, Siri. Your grant could be on the line here.
Watch your step, Siri. Your grant could be on the line here.
I just...well, I had this cousin in Delhi. She was having problems, too. She, ah...
I just...well, I had this cousin in Delhi. She was having problems, too. She, ah...
What?
What?
She used a baster.
Not a big one. I mean, it was like a turkey baster.
Oh, Jesus.
What's this?
Oh, right... They been here since noon. I told them you're real busy.
I'm gonna pull it out and I want you to pin it down, okay?
What is it?
What is it?
I have no idea. Are you ready?
It bit you.
No shit.
This wing configuration. I've never...
Fuck! It broke the skin...
Fuck! It broke the skin...
And they're not fully developed. This thing's not even an adult.
My God.
What?
That's impossible. Insects don't...
I know. Help me get a sample.
Oh, my!
Sorry, didn't mean to startle you. You didn't give me a chance to knock.
Sorry, didn't mean to startle you. You didn't give me a chance to knock.
Guess you can tell from my reaction, I'm not all that used to visitors out here. What can I do for you?

I was just wondering if you happen to know anything about Paul Sheldon.
I was just wondering if you happen to know anything about Paul Sheldon.
What do you want to know?
What do you want to know?
Anything you can tell me might help.
Excuse me, that's not exactly the kind of information I was after. You see, he's been missing for quite some time now, and...
I know. It's so upsetting. I'm his number-one fan...I've got all his books, every sentence he ever put down. I'm so proud of my Paul Sheldon collection... ...here I am, prattling on and my manners have just flown away. I haven't invited you in. Please.

Thank you.
God told me, since I was his number- one fan, that I should make up new stories as if I was Paul Sheldon. So, went to town. And I bought a typewriter. And paper to type on. The same kind Paul Sheldon used. And I turned the guest bedroom into a writing studio. Would you like to see it?
Sure.
Sure.
It's right this way.
Well... ...maybe it takes time to get the hang of it.
I could give you a couple of hundred pages of mine, and you could tell me what you think.

Well, I just thought--oh, look at me. You'd think I'd never had a house guest before. Would you like something to drink?

Sure.
How does a nice cup of cocoa sound?

Sounds good.
Must get lonely, living out here all by yourself.
I always say if you can't enjoy your own company, you're not fit company for anyone else.
I always say if you can't enjoy your own company, you're not fit company for anyone else.
You got a point there...
Thanks, Miz Wilkes, but I don't want to take up any more of your time. I best be going.
But you didn't even taste your cocoa.
If you don't mind, perhaps I could pay you another visit sometime.
I'd be delighted. Now that you know the way...
Shhh... we're just outside Silver Creek.
How long...?
How long...?
You've been here two days. You're gonna be okay. My name is Annie Wilkes and I'm--
You've been here two days. You're gonna be okay. My name is Annie Wilkes and I'm--
--my number one fan.
Here.
What are they...?
What are they...?
They're called Novril--they're for your pain.
Shouldn't I be in a hospital?
The blizzard was too strong. I couldn't risk trying to get you there. I tried calling, but the phone lines are down.
Your legs just sing grand opera when you move, don't they? It's not going to hurt forever, Paul, I promise you.
Will I be able to walk?
Will I be able to walk?
Of course you will. And your arm will be fine, too. Your shoulder was dislocated pretty badly, but I finally popped it back in there. But what I'm most proud of is the work I did on those legs. Considering what I had around the house, I don't think there's a doctor who could have done any better.
No, it wasn't a miracle at all... in a way, I was following you.
Following me?
Well, it wasn't any secret to me that you were staying at the Silver Creek, seeing as how I'm your number- one fan and all. Some nights I'd just tool on down there, sit outside and look up at the light in your cabin-- and I'd try to imagine what was going on in the room of the world's greatest writer.
Say that last part again, I didn't quite hear--
Say that last part again, I didn't quite hear--
Don't move now--wouldn't want to hurt this neck-- Well, the other afternoon I was on my way home, and there you were, leaving the Lodge, and I wondered why a literary genius would go for a drive when there was a big storm coming.

I didn't know it was going to be a big storm.
I didn't know it was going to be a big storm.
Lucky for you, I did. Lucky for me too. Because now you're alive and you can write more books. Oh, Paul, I've read everything of Yours, but the Misery novels...
You're very kind...
And you're very brilliant, and you must be a good man, or you could never have created such a wondrous, loving creature as Misery Chastain. Like a baby. All done.
When do you think the phone lines'll be back up? I have to call my daughter, and I should call New York and let my agent know I'm breathing.
It shouldn't be too much longer. Once the roads are open, the lines'll be up in no time. If you give me their numbers, I'll keep trying them for you. Could I ask you a favor? I noticed in your case there was a new Paul Sheldon book and... and I wondered if maybe...

You want to read it?
You want to read it?
If you wouldn't mind.
If you wouldn't mind.
I have a hard and fast rule about who can read my stuff at this early stage--only my editor, my agent, and anyone who saves me from freezing to death in a car wreck.

You'll never realize what a rare treat you've given me.
What's your new book called?
I don't have a title yet.
I don't have a title yet.
What's it about?
What's it about?
It's crazy, but I don't really know, I mean I haven't written anything but "Misery" for so long that--you read it you can tell me what you think it's about. Maybe you can come up with a title.

Oh, like I could do that?
But what?
Nothing.
Nothing.
No, what is it?
No, what is it?
Oh, it's ridiculous, who am I to make a criticism to someone like you?
Oh, it's ridiculous, who am I to make a criticism to someone like you?
I can take it, go ahead.
I can take it, go ahead.
Well, it's brilliantly written, but then everything you write is brilliant.

Pretty rough so far.

The swearing, Paul. There, I said it.

The profanity bothers you?

It has no nobility.

Well, these are slum kids, I was a slum kid, everybody talks like that.
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.
It's fine.
They had it at the store, Paul, there was a whole batch of them there. As soon as I saw it, I slammed my money down. I got the first copy.
Then the roads are open...
Then the roads are open...
The one to town is, but that's about it. I called the hospital and talked to the head orthopedic surgeon. I told him who you were and what had happened. He said as long as there's no infection, you're not in any danger, and as soon as the road to the hospital is open, they'll send an ambulance for you.

The phones are working?

Well, mine's still out. But the ones in town were working just fine. I called that agent of yours. Oh, Paul, I peeked at the very beginning. What a wonderful first page--just to read the name Misery Chastain...

...it's like a visit from my oldest, dearest friend.

I was supposed to be home for her birthday three days ago.
I was supposed to be home for her birthday three days ago.
Your agent said she would tell her you were okay. But I'm afraid you'll have to wait until tomorrow if you want to speak to her yourself.
I made you my speciality--scrambled eggs a la Wilkes. And I'm on page 75.
I guess that means it's okay.
I guess that means it's okay.
No. No, it isn't, it's-- --oh pooh, I can't think of any words. Would "great" be insulting?
No. No, it isn't, it's-- --oh pooh, I can't think of any words. Would "great" be insulting?
I can live with "great."
I don't mean to pry, but I've read in two magazines now where you were seeing this model who does those disgusting jeans commercials. And I said it can't be true. Paul Sheldon would never waste his time with a trampy woman like that.
Well, you can't believe everything you read in magazines.
Well, you can't believe everything you read in magazines.
I knew it. I knew it wasn't true. Boy, how do they get away with printing stuff like that?
I knew it. I knew it wasn't true. Boy, how do they get away with printing stuff like that?
You'd be amazed at what some people will believe.
Thank you so much.
My pleasure.
I thought it was time you two should meet. Paul, say hello to my favorite beast in all the world, my sow, Misery.
Misery?
Yes. I told you I was your number- one fan.
I'm getting to believe you.
I'm getting to believe you.
This farm was getting kind of dreary, what with just the few cows and chickens and me-- But when I got Misery here, everything Changed--she just makes me smile so.

She's a fine... uh... pig is what she is...

I'm on page three-hundred now, Paul, and it's better than perfect--it's divine. What's the ceiling that dago painted?
I'm on page three-hundred now, Paul, and it's better than perfect--it's divine. What's the ceiling that dago painted?
The Sistine Chapel?
The Sistine Chapel?
Yeah, that and Misery's Child--those are the only two divine things ever in this world...
For a while I thought I might go crazy.
I know how that can be.
I know how that can be.
I don't know about you, but what I did to get through it was I dove into work--days, nights--night shifts can be lonely at a hospital. I did a lot of reading. That was hen I first discovered Misery. She made me so happy. She made me forget all my problems. 'Course, I suppose you had a little something to do with that too.
I just kept reading them over and over. I know when I finish this one-- and I've only got two chapters to go-- I'll just turn right to the front page and start reading it again.
I'm...
I'm...
Done?
Done?
Yeah, thanks.
Yeah, thanks.
No problem.
Don't get me wrong. I'm not against marriage per se. But it would take a pretty special guy to make me want to go down the aisle again.
Well, it's not something you should enter into lightly.
Well, it's not something you should enter into lightly.
It boils down to respect. People just don't respect the institution of marriage any more. They have no sense of real commitment.
I'd love to stay here and chat, but I'm right at the end and I gotta find out what happens.
Well, I hope you like it.
Well, I hope you like it.
Of course I'll like it. Misery's about to have her child. What's it gonna be, a boy or a girl? Ooh, don't tell me.
You...you dirty bird. She can't be dead. Misery Chastain cannot be dead! How could you?
Annie, in 1871, women often died in childbirth, but her spirit is the important thing, and Misery's spirit is still alive--
Annie, in 1871, women often died in childbirth, but her spirit is the important thing, and Misery's spirit is still alive--
I DON'T WANT HER SPIRIT! I want HER! And you MURDERED her!

I DIDN'T...

Then who did?
Then who did?
No one--she just died--she slipped away, that's all.
No one--she just died--she slipped away, that's all.
She slipped away? She slipped away? She didn't just slip away. You did it. You did it. You did it. You did it. You murdered my Misery.
What are you doing on the floor? It's my fault. If I'd had a proper hospital bed, this never would have happened. Here, let me help you back in. I know this hurts, but it'll only take a few seconds. There you go. Comfy?
Perfect.
Perfect.
You're such a kidder. I have a big surprise for you. But first there's something you must do.

I don't suppose I could have a little snack while I wait for the surprise?
I don't suppose I could have a little snack while I wait for the surprise?
I'll get you everything you want, but you must listen first. Sometimes my thinking is a little muddy, I accept that. It's why I couldn't remember all those things they were asking me on the witness stand in Denver.
But this time I thought clearly. I asked God about you and God said "I delivered him unto you so that you may show him the way."
Show me the way?
Show me the way?
Yes.
You want me to burn my book?
Yes.
Yes.
You want me to burn my book?
You want me to burn my book?
I know this may be difficult for you, but it's for the best.
I know this may be difficult for you, but it's for the best.
This isn't difficult, my agent's made dozens of copies. There's gonna be an auction on this, and every publishing house in New York is reading it now. So if you want me to burn it, fine. You're not ridding the world of anything.
Then light the match, Paul.
No big deal.
No big deal.
So you've indicated. Do it.
I know this is the only copy, Paul. When you were twenty-four you wrote your first book and you didn't make a copy, because you didn't think anybody would take it seriously. But they did. And ever since you've never made any copies because you're superstitious--it's why you always come back to the Silver Creek Lodge. You told that story to Merv Griffin eleven
You know, Annie, this book never would have survived without you. When it gets to new York, there will be a big auction, and whatever it brings we can split. God knows you're entitled to it.

Oh, Paul. This isn't about money. It's about decency and purity. It's about God's values.
Oh, Paul. This isn't about money. It's about decency and purity. It's about God's values.
You're right. You're right. I don't know what I was thinking. I'll tell you what. It doesn't have to be published. Nobody ever has to see it. I'll just keep it for myself. No one will ever have to know it exists.
You're right. You're right. I don't know what I was thinking. I'll tell you what. It doesn't have to be published. Nobody ever has to see it. I'll just keep it for myself. No one will ever have to know it exists.
As long as it does exist, your mind won't ever be free. I think you should light the match, Paul.
I do believe the winters are getting shorter and shorter every year. People say it has something to do with the ozone layer. What do you think?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Yeah, well, it's a theory. Here's your Novril. How does tuna casserole sound for dinner?
Yeah, well, it's a theory. Here's your Novril. How does tuna casserole sound for dinner?
Great.
See, isn't this nice?
Great. I've always wanted to visit the other side of the room.
Great. I've always wanted to visit the other side of the room.
And look what I've got for you. An electric razor so you can shave yourself now.
And look what I've got for you. An electric razor so you can shave yourself now.
If I knew this was gonna be the surprise, you could've gotten me to burn all my books.
If I knew this was gonna be the surprise, you could've gotten me to burn all my books.
Now don't josh. This is a very big day for you, Paul. Here. You just sit tight, and I'll set everything up.
Set what up?
That's the big surprise. Your new studio--after all, writers do need a place to work.
That's the big surprise. Your new studio--after all, writers do need a place to work.
Work? You mean write? What in the world do you think I'd write?
Work? You mean write? What in the world do you think I'd write?
Oh, but Paul! I don't think, I know! Now that you've gotten rid of that nasty manuscript, you can go back to doing what you're great at-- --you're going to write a new novel-- your greatest achievement ever-- Misery's Return.
Misery's Return?
I know you didn't mean it when you killed her, and now you'll make it right.
Yes. It will be a book in my honor. For saving your life and nursing you back to health. I'll be the first one to read it. Oh, Paul, you're going to make me the envy of the whole world...
You just expect me to whip something off, that it?
You just expect me to whip something off, that it?
I expect nothing less than your masterpiece.
I expect nothing less than your masterpiece.
You do understand that this isn't the ordinary way books get written-- I mean, some people might actually consider this an oddball situation.
I guess you don't get bothered by neighbors much.
Don't worry about that. You'll have total solitude so you can concentrate on your work.
Don't worry about that. You'll have total solitude so you can concentrate on your work.
Great.
And I got a great deal on this fifty- pound clunker--on account of it's missing an "n." I told the saleslady "n" was one of the letters in my favorite writer's name.
It's two of the letters in my favorite nurse's name, Annie.

You--fooler...! Did I do good?
You--fooler...! Did I do good?
You did great, except there's just one little thing--I can't work with this paper. It's Corrasable Bond, it smudges. Maybe you could go back into town and bring me some white, long-grained mimeo.
You did great, except there's just one little thing--I can't work with this paper. It's Corrasable Bond, it smudges. Maybe you could go back into town and bring me some white, long-grained mimeo.
But mine cost the most so I don't see how it could smudge.
But mine cost the most so I don't see how it could smudge.
C'mere, I'll show you.
Well, it does smudge after all--isn't that fascinating?
I thought you'd be interested. I'd like you to be in on everything, Annie. Not just the finished book, but how it's written.
I thought you'd be interested. I'd like you to be in on everything, Annie. Not just the finished book, but how it's written.
Thank you for thinking of me. Anything else I can get while I'm in town? Any other crucial requirements that need satisfying? Would you like a tiny tape recorder? Or maybe a handmade set of writing slippers?

Annie, what's the matter?
Annie, what's the matter?
What's the matter? I'll tell you what's the matter. I go out of my way for you. I do everything to try and make you happy. I feed you, I clean you, I dress you. And what thanks do I get? "You bought the wrong paper, Annie. I can't write on this paper, Annie." Well, I'll get your stupid paper, but you just better
Paul, you're dripping with perspiration, your color is very hectic--what have you been doing?
You know goddamn well what I've been doing--I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE SUFFERING. I need my pills.
You know goddamn well what I've been doing--I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE SUFFERING. I need my pills.
Poor dear... Let's get you back in bed and I'll get them for you.

I want my pills NOW!

It'll only take a second.
It'll only take a second.
I want my pain to go 'way, Annie-- make it go 'way, please Annie-- --please...
Here, in case you think of any ideas.
Yeah, well I wouldn't expect too much.
Yeah, well I wouldn't expect too much.
Don't be silly. You'll be brilliant. Think of me as your inspiration.
I'm sorry, Paul. This is all wrong, you'll have to do it over again.
What? What happened to "I'll treasure whatever you do?"
What? What happened to "I'll treasure whatever you do?"
Paul, it's not worthy of you. Throw it all out except for the part of naming that gravedigger after me. You can leave that in.

--cliff-hangers--
I know that, Mister Man--they also call them serials. I'm not stupid, you know. Anyway, my favorite was Rocket Man, and once it was a no-brakes chapter, the bad guys stuck him in a car on a mountain road and knocked him out and welded the doors shut and tore out the brakes and started him to his death and he woke up and
"HE DIDN'T GET OUT OF THE COCKADOODIE CAR!"
They always cheated like that in cliff-- --chapter plays.

But not you. Not with my Misery. Remember, Ian did ride for Dr. Cleary at the end of the last book, but his horse fell jumping that fence and Ian broke his shoulder and his ribs and lay there all night in the ditch so he never reached the doctor, so there couldn't have been any "experimental blood transfusion" that saved her life.

What's the matter, Paul? You haven't written a word.
I can't write this anymore.
I can't write this anymore.
Don't be silly. Of course you can.
Don't be silly. Of course you can.
I'm telling you, I can't.
I'm telling you, I can't.
You can--you have the "gotta"--
You can--you have the "gotta"--
The what?
The what?
The "gotta." Remember, you talked about it in Playboy magazine. You said there's a million things you can't do in this world; you can't hit a curve ball, you can't fix a leaky faucet or make a marriage work-- but there's one thing you always have, and that's the power of the "gotta."

I said that?
I said that?
You said you can make it so they gotta turn the page. You know, "I 'gotta' know will she live," "I 'gotta' know will he catch the killer." "I gotta see how this chapter ends." You said it. I don't usually buy that magazine. I only got it, 'cause they were interviewing you.
What about a bee...?
What?
What?
Nothing.
Well, is it fair? Should I keep going?
You better. Oh, Paul, when Ian realized that the reason they'd buried Misery alive was because the bee sting had put her in that temporary coma--
I've known from the very first book that Misery had to be born of nobility and I was right!
Yeah, yeah...
Oh, Paul, can I read each chapter when you finish? I can fill in the "n"s. Will she be her old self, now that Ian has dug her out, or will she have amnesia...?
...have to wait.
...have to wait.
Will she still love him with that special perfect love?
Will she still love him with that special perfect love?
Have to wait.
Have to wait.
Not even a hint?
Misery's alive! Misery's alive. Oh, it's so romantic--this whole house is going to be filled with romance. I'm going to put on my Liberace records-- --you do like Liberace, don't you?
Whenever he played Radio City, who do you think was right there in the front row?
Whenever he played Radio City, who do you think was right there in the front row?
I'm going to play my records all day
To celebrate Misery's return. I couldn't have done it without you.
Oh, Paul. It would be an honor.
I hope you like it.
It looks wonderful. And so do you.
It looks wonderful. And so do you.
Oh...
I've never had meatloaf this good, what do you do to it?
My secret is I only use fresh tomatoes, never canned. And to give it that little extra zip, I mix in some Spam with the ground beef.

Oh. You can't get this in a restaurant in New York.
Annie, I think we should have a toast.
A toast?
A toast?
Yes, to Misery. Let me pour you some more wine.
To Misery.
Wait, let's do this right. Do you have any candles?
Wait, let's do this right. Do you have any candles?
Oh, I don't know. I think so. I'll go look.
Did you study decorating, or do you just have a flair?
Oh, you. I just picked things up over the years.
Oh, you. I just picked things up over the years.
Well, it certainly says you.
Well, it certainly says you.
You really think so?
You really think so?
Absolutely. Listen, if you can't find any, it's okay. I just thought it might be nice.
Are you kidding? If anyone ever told me that one day I'd be having a candlelit dinner with Paul Sheldon in my own house, I woulda checked both legs to see which one was being pulled. Will this do?
It's perfect.
Oh, God, what have I done? I'm so sorry, Paul. I ruined your beautiful toast. Will you ever forgive me? Here, let me pour another one. Can we pretend this never happened? To Misery?
To Misery.
Paul, this is positively the best Misery you've ever written.
I think you're right.
Annie, what is it?
The rain... sometimes it gives me the blues.
When you first came here, I only loved the writer part of Paul Sheldon. But now I know I love the rest of him too. As much as Misery loves Ian. I know you don't love me--don't say you do--you're a beautiful, brilliant, famous man of the world; and I'm...not a movie star type. You'll never know the fear of losing someone like you
Why would you lose me?
Why would you lose me?
The book is almost finished. Your legs are getting better. Soon you'll be able to walk. You'll be wanting to leave.

That's very kind of you, but I'll bet it's not altogether true.

It is.
Paul, I know you've been out.
What?
What?
You've been out of your room.
You've been out of your room.
No, I haven't.
No, I haven't.
Paul, my little ceramic penguin in the study always faces due south.

I don't know what you're talking about.
Now don't fuss, Paul.
Why would I run away? I'm a writer, Annie--it's all I am--and I've never written this well--even you said that this is my best, didn't you?
Paul, don't you think it's time for you to start writing again? It's been over a week.
I don't know, it's weird, but a couple of broken bones hasn't done a lot for my creative juices. Get the fuck out of here.

That's disgusting.
I know you do. I love you too, Annie. And you're right. We are meant to be together. And I know we must die. But it must be so that Misery can live. We have the power to give Misery eternal life. We must finish the book.
But the time is now. Soon others will come.
But the time is now. Soon others will come.
It's almost done. By dawn we'll be able to give Misery back to the world.
Oh, Paul. It's beautiful.
Three more chapters to go.
The stranger staying at the Inn, is he someone from Misery's past?
Maybe.
Maybe.
This is so exciting. It's Windthorne, her first love, right?
This is so exciting. It's Windthorne, her first love, right?
Maybe. Are you ready for the next chapter?
It WAS Windthorne. I knew it--what does that do to her love for Ian?-- --of course, if she hadn't thought Windthorne was murdered she never would have fallen in love with Ian in the first place. Sorry, it's just that this is so wonderful.
I'm glad you like it.
I'm glad you like it.
Paul, this will be our legacy.
Paul, this will be our legacy.
It will.
Oh, Paul. I'm dying. Does she wind up with Ian or Windthorne? You have to tell me.
You'll know very soon. I'm starting the last chapter. And when I finish, I want everything to be perfect. I'll require three things.
You'll know very soon. I'm starting the last chapter. And when I finish, I want everything to be perfect. I'll require three things.
What things?

You don't know?

I was fooling, silly. You need a cigarette, because you used to smoke but you quit except when you finish a book, and you just have one, and the match is to light it. And you need one glass of champagne. Dome Pear-igg-non.

Yes, Paul.
I'm almost done.
I'm almost done.
Oh, Paul, this is so romantic. Ian and Windthorne dueling for the right to Misery's hand. Does Ian win? Oh, don't me. It's Windthorne, right?

Ahh!!!
Did I do good?
You did perfect. Except for one thing. This time we need two glasses.
We actually got a phone call. Busy morning.
Work, work, work. Virginia? When was that blizzard?
Work, work, work. Virginia? When was that blizzard?
Four or five days ago. Why?
Virginia, when you're in this car, you're not my wife, you're my deputy.
Well, this deputy would rather be home under the covers with the Sheriff.
Stop--stop right here.
What? What is it?
Could be the weight of the snow.
Could be--or a rotten branch or a mountain lion could have landed on it. Could be a lot of things.
You really think Sheldon's out there?
Hope not--if he is, he's dead. Let's go to the newspaper office.
Here's the list of all Sheldon's credit charges. Nothing after the Silver Creek. Any calls?
Just from his agent.
You don't think he's dead, do you?
He might well be. But not the way they say. He didn't crawl out of that car by himself. You saw those dents on the door--someone pulled him out.

There's two kinds of people that drive around in old cars: the ones that can't afford new ones, and the ones who wouldn't give 'em up for anything in the world. That second bunch don't drive around with twenty- five-year-old dents.
Hey, Jim, what's doing? Uh-huh... uh- huh... Jim, we've been over this. If you're gonna have benches in front of your store, people are gonna sit on them. I don't like him either, but I'm not going to come over there and tell him to move. Give my best to Denise. Bye.
Well, whoever she is, she sure likes to read a lot.
Well, whoever she is, she sure likes to read a lot.
Virginia, I'm flattered you think I got that much energy. I just figured if I can't find Paul Sheldon, at least I can find out what he wrote about.

What do you expect to find? A story about a guy who drove his car off a cliff in a snowstorm?

Now, you see, it's that kind of sarcasm that's given our marriage real spice.
"There is a justice higher than that of man. I will be judged by Him."
What?
What?
They're hauling Misery into court.

That's nice.

I'm a literary agent, and I feel like a fool calling you, but I think one of my clients, Paul Sheldon, might be in some kind of trouble.
Paul Sheldon? You mean Paul Sheldon the writer?
Paul Sheldon? You mean Paul Sheldon the writer?
Yes.
Yes.
He's your client, huh?

Yes, he is.
People sure like those Misery books.
I'm sure you know Paul's been going to the Silver Creek Lodge for years to finish his books.

Not quite. I just called, and they said he checked out five days ago. Isn't that a little strange?
Not quite. I just called, and they said he checked out five days ago. Isn't that a little strange?
I don't know. Does he always phone you when he checks out of hotels?
No, no, of course not. It's just that his daughter hasn't heard from him, and when he's got a book coming out, he usually keeps in touch. So when there was no word from him...
You think he might be missing?
You think he might be missing?
I hate that I made this call--tell me I'm being silly.
I appreciate that. Thanks a lot.
G'bye, Ms. Sindell.
Nothing unusual about Mr. Sheldon's leaving, Buster--you can tell by the champagne.
Maybe you can, Libby.
Maybe you can, Libby.
No, see, he always ordered a bottle of Dom Perignon when he was ready to go. Then he'd pay up and be out the door.

No long-distance phone calls, Federal Express packages--anything at all out of the ordinary?

I don't think Mr. Sheldon likes for things to be out of the ordinary. Considering who he is and all, famous and all, he doesn't have airs. Drives the same car out from New York each time--'65 Mustang--said it helps him think. He was always a good guest, never made a noise, never bothered a soul. Sure hope nothing happened to him.

Marcia, you know I started "Misery" on a lark. Do I look like a guy who writes romance novels? Do I sound like Danielle Steel? It was a one- time shot and we got lucky. I never meant it to become my life. And if I hadn't gotten rid of her now, I'd have ended up writing her forever. For the first time in

I'm glad to hear that, Paul, I really am. But you have to know--when your fans find out that you killed off their favorite heroine, they're not going to say, "Ooh, good, Paul Sheldon can finally write what we've always wanted: An esoteric, semi- autobiographical character study.

Marcia, why are you doing this to me? Don't you know I'm scared enough? Don't you think I remember how nobody gave a shit about my first books? You think I'm dying to go back to shouting in the wilderness? I'm doing this because I have to. Now, I'm leaving for Colorado to try to finish this and I want your good thoughts--because if

I'm delighted the critics are liking it, and I hope the people like it, too. But it's not why I wrote the book.
I like it. Remember how you once said I live my whole life as if I'm in danger of being found out? Well, I believe I've managed to get that guy down on paper. Don't think I'm completely nuts, but in some way, Annie Wilkes, that whole experience, helped me.
Paul, since you brought her up, I have to ask you this, or I'd be drummed out of the agents' union-- what about a non-fiction book? The truth about what went on in that house.

Wasn't exactly gagging for it when she left you six months ago..The question is, do you trust her?
One considers her timing, of course - getting nicked within a week of the plane going down. Suggestive, even borderline suspicious, but hardly conclusive.
Well, you've thorough about it, at any rate.
You're not scrutinizing any casual shrug for some hair-splitting nuance, are you?

Well, that's good, isn't?

She wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you, Hunt. from this moment you're responsible for what happens to her, and if you're looking out for her well-being, I suggest you advise her to pick up the gun and bring it to me. Ball's in your court, Hunt. What've you got to say? Nyah's waiting for your answer.
Oh, Hunt, please! One can't hold Nyah responsible for her actions..
In other words, you're calling her a flake.
Checkpoint Charlie plus 30, altitude minus two-zero-thousand. Airspeed one-seven- niner knots..
It's that time. Go.
Not exactly. Wallis?
More like two-two point two million.
More like two-two point two million.
In any case we don't want your cash.
-- now here's the way it's going to work..Wallis, the shares outstanding are..
Ninety-three point four million.
Ninety-three point four million.
Which means, Mr. McCloy, we have to get our hands on four hundred and eighty thousand options. We'll borrow your thirty million to buy those options. Your stock's never sold above thirty-one dollars a share. We'll agree to buy at fifty.
Damn. Just when it was about to get interesting.
It's okay. She scrambled the transmission. Luther, continue feeding the GPS her position.
What you got there, mate?
A myth..just a myth...shouldn't you be checking out their countersurveillance?

Well do you disagree with that?
Not at all. But how about going into town and confirming your intuitions on site?

Oh well, if that's how you feel about it.
Ambrose is meeting some bloke in the bar. Big bloke, ginger hair. They're into something.
I'll be damned. It's McCloy, the Biocyte CEO.
Wrong. All we've got to worry about is Ambrose. Nyah will take care of Nyah.
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
Unless we dose her with Bellerophon on the next ninety-seven minutes, Nyah will kill herself. So, first things, first. Swanbeck said there's no cash movement from any monitored terrorist accounts.
It is, Billy.
Then we got'em!
Ambrose obviously got these from Nekhorvich on the plane.
What manic invents disease like that in the first place? Why would he do it?
So Ambrose has Bellerophon and McCloy's got Chimera.
There guys are walking around with different halves of the same dollar bill?
Package away in five..four..three.. two..one...
I'm not ready!
Billy. I think we got a problem. Nyah's on the wing. Up early. Billy, do you copy?
Exactly where is she?
Exactly where is she?
..in the building...
Before we kill her or cure her..
Right.
We're due to take off.
Not for seven more minutes.
Range is two kay.
I hope there's a place to land.
There she is. I got visual.
We're down to seven minutes 23 seconds..
That's it? That's it? That's it?
And the check's in the mall.
And the check's in the mall.
Right. Just remember, mates. Billy Baird's the name. Anything you need to get, move or watch, I'm your man.
I'm booted up. Go, Ethan.
He's heading down the stairs, now..
Say again. Sounds like you're saying 'she's in the building.'
I am. She is.
She's in the elevator heading toward Ethan.
How much longer before you can reach him?
How much longer before you can reach him?
Five and a half minutes. He's breached the hot zone..
How're we doin', then?
He should've have killed the virus in the incubation area..Nyah's exited the elevator on the same level as the lab.

What can we do' mate?
What can we do' mate?
Hope he kills all the bugs before the yellow dot gets to the red one.
Do you know me?
No. Should I?
No. Should I?
No. You just looked as if you did.
No. You just looked as if you did.
No. Just as if I'd like to.
No. Just as if I'd like to.
Oh. Well. I think that can be arranged.

Not tonight. Bad timing. Sorry -

There's not enough time in the world for any of it to be bad.
Look, it's either you or the rent and I don't mind telling you it's not an easy choice.
What if I pay the rent?

Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.

What are you doing here?
Think you're the only one who can pick a lock?

I see. You're not just another pretty face..
Would you mind if I'm on top?
Oh, either way works for me.

Far right.
Where's the bloody -

I wouldn't do that.
Do what?
Under the circumstances I think we would recommend re-setting the senors to respond to a lighter load. How do you feel about forty kilos, Miss Hall?
Indeed.
Indeed.
Well, Senor de l'Arena, there's no reason to disrupt your party any longer. we have some further concerns about the disposition of your security guards, which you'll receive in our written report by fax in the morning, hard copy to follow. Shall we?
I'm missing something here, aside from a 500,000 pound necklace. Even after I botched the job, I could've walked out of there with the bloody thing.
At least you walked.

If you weren't going to let me get away with it, why did you let me go thru with it?

You didn't do that badly.
You're apologizing for me? Quite the gentleman..
Not really. I triggered the alarm..
Hola..
Hi. Would you mind slowing down?

Ethan Hunt.

Well, Ethan Hunt, what is it you want to talk to me about?
Awfully short notice..
Care to wait a decent interval?

Who wants to be decent?..
When they've got your recruiting technique? Not a thing.
Oh. Well..this isn't exactly by the book.

The only other spook I knew was a liar. Charming but absolutely incapable of telling the truth. He'd lie about his favorite color. But then I reckon it's an occupational hazard. All spies really do is conceal the truth and tell lies.

So where did I got right?
You're not a liar. Or you're an awfully good one.. ..this thing these blokes pinched..
You're not a liar. Or you're an awfully good one.. ..this thing these blokes pinched..
I don't know that they 'pinched' it. Don't even know that they're blokes.
Well, then, what I am I doing here? I assume I'm meant to be some sort of thief-to catch-a-thief..
So do I. Sort of.
Spoken like a spook..you ever afraid?
Of what?
Ask a question, you get an answer!..
Damn, you're beautiful.

Not that it matter much but..I seem to recall you staying something like, 'I was hoping we could work together.'
This wasn't what I had in mind, Nyah.
This wasn't what I had in mind, Nyah.
But it is what you'd like me to do. so tell me to do it..
Go and insinuate yourself back into Sean's life.
I'd like a little more conviction..

No. You can be a thief and have a conscience: Not me. Why did you have to tell me about this! What do I have to do to get away from this guy?

Much.

Then feel better!..
Sean will never be anything but suspicious if he picks up some sort of 'yoo-hoo-I'm- not-nad' message. Not after the way we broke up.
What wouldn't make him suspicious?
What wouldn't make him suspicious?
Probably that I needed him in some urgent way..destitute - in serious trouble..the kind I couldn't possible sort out myself..
Look, I can't run your arrest in CNN, but I guarantee he's monitoring every law enforcement agency in the world, for what they might be saying about him, if nothing else - he's got the ability and, we assume, the desire to get you out of there.
This doesn't seem to be accomplishing much.

Well, forewarned is forearmed. And while we're at it, be especially sensitive to any sudden change in Ambrose's plans, especially any involving you..
How's it going? Everything okay?
Just like old times.
Just like old times.
Just like old times?
Just like old times?
Just about..
We know him. He's over your left shoulder, looking right at you as you go on..

I've no doubt.
Ambrose has photographs of newspapers with loads of money piled on them -- thirty- seven million on the London Times. What's that about?
Bids from possible Chimera buyers -- to prove that as of the date on the newspaper those bids are back up by earnest money --
-- his left jacket pocket.
Affirmative.
Where do I meet you?
Betting table twelve off the paddock. Nyah, are you up to this?
Betting table twelve off the paddock. Nyah, are you up to this?
I'll muddle through.
I managed.
You noticed. What're you going to do? Spank me?
I want <i>you out of there.</i>
Why? What's happened. What did you see?
Nyah, you've done more than enough. Even the best of snake charmers get bit.
Ethan, tell me -
I want you out of Australia! ..I don't know how much more plainly I can put it.
How do you suggest I go about it?
How do you suggest I go about it?
He's touched your heart. You're overwhelmed. You need to think it over. You'll meet him somewhere in a month. If You're not out in 48 hours I'm coming in and getting you out. Give me the ear piece.
Easy, easy, easy, shhh!
Oh Ethan!..
Are you okay?
I am now. Get me out of here. Just get me out of here.
I am now. Get me out of here. Just get me out of here.
It's going to be okay.
Ethan, you know what frightens me most when I'm with him?..the thought of never seeing you..how are we getting out of here?
Nyah, it's very important not do anything to alarm Ambrose..
Nyah, it's very important not do anything to alarm Ambrose..
What? You told me to get out of here. I thought you were here to collect me. I was so relieved.
What? You told me to get out of here. I thought you were here to collect me. I was so relieved.
No time to explain. You've done well, and we're so close. So close. It's critical that you do whatever Ambrose asks. Don't worry - it'll be over soon.. That's a promise.. Come on, now off you go!
What did you think you were doing!
I wasn't thinking! Just..trying to keep you from getting hurt, that's all.
- you who don't have a conscience.
I guess I lied..You can't get both of us out of here, can you?
I guess I lied..You can't get both of us out of here, can you?
No.
No.
Then you'll have to kill me before it's too late. Before I start killing people.
Then you'll have to kill me before it's too late. Before I start killing people.
No.
No.
I'm infected with Chimera. You know you don't have a choice. Just do it now.
No. Should I?
No. You just looked as if you did.

No...
Sorry I didn't let you know where I was.
Don't be. Wouldn't be on vacation if you did.

Well. You're sorry and I'm sorry.

'You're sorry and I'm sorry.'

You gotta be kidding.
An idea, yeah.
Like?
Like?
Like it's a good idea to pick him up in a hurry. And a bad idea to fly him on a commercial carrier. So let's get on with it. He's still in Sydney?

Dr. Vladimir Nekhorvich is dead. So is his colleague, Gradski, but that happened earlier. We had Nekhorvich on a flight from Sydney that crashed in the Rockies..
If he didn't want to go anywhere without me, how did you get him on the flight?
You were there.
When I couldn't find you, I had to replace you. Sean Ambrose was the obvious choice. He double you, what? Two, three times?
Twice.
Twice.
What did you think of him?
What did you think of him?
You know we had reservations about each other. Isn't it a little late in the day to be asking me that?
You know we had reservations about each other. Isn't it a little late in the day to be asking me that?
Not necessarily.
So there's one thing we know Ambrose doesn't.
Then you do think it was Ambrose.
Whatever Nekhorvich was carrying Sean wanted and he wanted to conceal the fact that he took it.
Enough to kill Nekhorvich and two hundred innocent passengers?
Sean feels he hasn't done the job unless he leaves a lot of hats on the ground.
The question is why? What was this Chimera Nekhorvich was carrying?
Right now only Ambrose knows that.
In any case, you've got to recover Chimera and bring it to us.

In order to do that, I've got to figure out how he plans to make money with it.

Miss Hall and Ambrose had a relationship which he took very seriously. She walked away and he's wanting her back ever since. We believe she's our surest and quickest way of location him.

You mean it'll be difficult.
Very.
Very.
Well it's not mission <i>difficult,</i> Hunt. It's mission <i>impossible.</i> Difficult should be a walk in the park for you. If you can think of a quicker way to get to Ambrose, you're welcome to try. Oh, by the way, you might want to take a look at these..if you have any further qualms about getting her to do the job.
Not yet. We did manage to pull any sensitive equipment and material out of our safehouse wreckage.
We could lock down passport control and all ports of authority, but that won't stop Ambrose, and beyond him, we don't know who else we're looking for -- all terrorist bank accounts of which we're aware are stable. No deposits, no withdrawals. Therefore no suspects.

We think we've got our finger on the buyer.
Do you? Even assuming you're able to prevent Ambrose selling Chimera, you've now got an additional problem. You destroyed all of Chimera at Biocyte. If Ambrose is going to sell Chimera now, he'll have to do it by taking a pint or so of Miss Hall's blood to market.

But that leaves another seven or eight pints of Chimera.

Yes, I believe that's right. Now my understanding is that 20 hours after exposure, the victim becomes infectious. Highly infectious.
- good. Then if you manage to get hold of Ambrose, and obtain what he's got, you've got - - 8 hours 57 minutes and twenty-three seconds to destroy the largest remaining source of Chimera on earth.
She sacrificed herself..
She sacrificed herself..
Brave girl. If you can get hold of Bellerophon with the time limit, you may spare her the ultimate sacrifice. But in either case you've got less than nine hours to kill her or cure her. After that it's out of our hands and a matter of worldwide material law. And Hunt. However you obtain it, we want you to preserve a sample of
Something else?
Aren't you even curious? About why she did it?
Aren't you even curious? About why she did it?
No. I can't afford to be curious. And neither can you, Hunt..
Sorry, Ethan. I don't quite know where to begin. Any suggestions?
You'd like me to conduct my own debriefing.
You'd like me to conduct my own debriefing.
Why not? You've done just about everything else on this operation.

I'd thank you -- but I'm not sure that was a compliment.
I'd thank you -- but I'm not sure that was a compliment.
Of course it was. Anyone whose operations requires the level of disinformation that yours do, is bound to get a little flak here and there. You try flogging the stories on CNN I've had to come up with about what's been going on around here the last few days. At any rate, it's been most instructive -- what they'll swallow, or what they'll broadcast

And the only other remaining sample was in the canister you recover from Ambrose.

By fire. That's the best way, really.
No, I don't. But in this case -
In this case, it wasn't a bad idea. In face, it was a pretty damn good idea. Just don't make a habit of it. And, as for Ms. Hall, in light of her efforts, her criminal records will certainly be expunged. I'm assuming you approve.

Yes, he knew. Just..
Yes, he knew. Just..
..not in time to save him.
..not in time to save him.
No. After you've lived with <i>Chimera</i> for twenty hours, nothing can save you. Not even...<i>Bellerophon.</i>
..it seems we have a problem, Dmitri.
You keep calling me Dmitri. You really shouldn't.
..I'm fine..and you?
I'm fine..
It's the transponder.
Put in the coordinates and let's get a visual. The visuals aren't coming up.

The satellite doesn't work as fast as I do.
Nekhorvich specialized in recombining DNA molecules. In the myth, Bellerophon killed Chimera, a recombinant monster with the head of a lion and the tail of a serpent who plagued the ancient world. I think Nekhorvich has created a monster virus in Chimera and apparently the means to kill it in Bellerophon.
That simple, huh?
That simple, huh?
Why not?
Luther..get us everything you can on the outbreak of influenza on Bruny Island last month, including photos of the victims.
Right. I guess there aren't many flu epidemics in the middle of summer.
Nekhorvich's boss?
Yep.
Ambrose just pulled the memory card out of the digital camera and put it into an envelope, put it in his inner left jacket pocket...
Left jacket pocket?
Left jacket pocket?
Roger that.
Roger that.
Confirm. Left jacket pocket.

Nyah, Ambrose is heading back. There's an enveloped inside --
I don't know, but Nekhorvich was not a manic. Get me a twenty on Nyah.
She must still be on the property.
She must still be on the property.
I told her to get outta there.
Ambrose got Bellerophon from Nekhorvich on the plane, but he didn't get the Chimera virus.
Yeah. Why else would he come back to Australia? If he had them both, he could sell them anywhere.

I kill Chimera at Biocyte and he's sitting on a cure without a disease.
I kill Chimera at Biocyte and he's sitting on a cure without a disease.
You've got the voice print, I'll get us in..
Sorry, that it a Biocyte facility, their storage structure..
Nyah still on the property?
Let's start from the inside out.
All storage and production of Chimera is done here, in this lab on the forty-second floor, the heart of the building.
Now how to get in there.
No garage entrance. Lobby's protected by five guards on rotating patrol.
Thirty-second opening in the roof and a 250-foot drop.
I'm not waiting 48 hours. When we're done at Biocyte, if she's not out of Ambrose's, I'm going in and getting her out.
Luther, I'm looking at security.
Oh. Uh. Commencing diversion. Alarm in cosmetics.
Ethan, I keep telling you there's not a chance of locating Nyah til I access the satellite and there's not a chance of doing that til I get this thing booted up and running! How much time does she have left?
Ninety-seven minutes, twenty-seven seconds.
Luther, say again.
She's on the North Head Bluff - approaching the cliffs. One klick away.
She's on the North Head Bluff - approaching the cliffs. One klick away.
Copy. She's only got twenty-eight minutes left. Track ahead and pick her up.
So what did he say?
Good job. And thanks.
A visit from an old friend.
What's happening here? You're dead!
What's happening here? You're dead!
Fatigued, certainly. But dead is a little extreme. On the other hand, when me dear Gradski had your pulse and blood pressure he has less than ten hours to live.

You took it! All of it! And what if I need it?

You still don't get it, do you? You want to make an omelet, you break a few eggs - <i>I needed to know just how bad the disease was</i> - in the real world, not the lab.

You wanted the disease in order to peddle the cure.
You wanted the disease in order to peddle the cure.
Well, the thought had occurred to me. I needed Chimera in order to peddle Bellerophon. For hero to be appreciated, you need a monster. Now that's not so difficult to understand, is it? Look, time was a shot of penicillin could knock off every bloody bug in the zoo! Not anymore!..have you any idea the R&D money it takes to float one little pissy

You know, I think it's a little late for that. Do give my regards to Gradski if you see him.
Kasimov, Kasimov, good that you called us.
I don't remember what happened! We were at the bar, drinking, laughing -- having fun.
C'mon, c'mon, tell the truth...c'mon.
They'll kill me.
You asked for my help. You <u>asked</u> for <u>my</u> help...come on...
You're right, of course.
Come on!

The man's gone black, Barnes. He's under until he decides to surface.
Look we can use someone from the Embassy and we can get the local authorities involved. Close off his transportation.

What can we do, Barnes? Put a guy at the airport? How many identities do you think Hunt has? How many times has he slipped past custom, in how many countries? These guys are trained to be ghosts. <u>We</u> taught them how to do it, for Christ's sake!

Let's not waste time chasing him. Make him come to us. Everybodyís got pressure points. Find out something that's important to him personally and you squeeze.
That's S.O.P..

Same thing he wanted in Prague! Same thing he's always wanted! The NOC list!
Same thing he wanted in Prague! Same thing he's always wanted! The NOC list!
Okay!
You and I know about this -- and that's where it stops. Understand? It never happened.
What about him...?
Only four more cars.
And if we donít find him - weíll search the whole train again.

Good idea.
You knew about Jim?
Course he did. Just exactly when he knew is something of a question. Before or after I showed in London, mind telling me, Ethan?
Two minutes til Krieger shows. Thisíll have to be quicker than Iíd like. Certainly quicker than youíd like.
Ethan, if you knew about Jim?..Why..
Ethan, if you knew about Jim?..Why..
Why the masquerade? Why take the risk? Well, Claire, youíve asked the question and you are the answer.
Well Claire do you? Have you been exploiting his feelings or returning them?
Jim - lets just get the money and get out of here.
Satisfied?
All ten million.
All ten million.
Fold it. Fold it tight.
Donít Jim.
Now we donít have to eliminate him? You like that, donít you Claire? Donít you?
Now we donít have to eliminate him? You like that, donít you Claire? Donít you?
Yes.
Is he serious?
Always.
Always.
If we're going to Virginia, why don't we drop by Fort Knox? I can fly a helicopter right in through the lobby and set it down inside the vault and it will be a hell of a lot easier than breaking into the God damn CIA.
Krieger can get it. Right?
May take a little time.
I don't think you're in any position to give orders, do you? Not while I'm holding this.
Krieger.
Krieger.
Stay out of this. OR Lachez - moi OR T'agueue

Why haven't they brought us in yet?
I've been disavowed. They think I killed Jim and everyone else. Somehow a hundred thousand dollars found its way into my parents' bank account. Kittridge assumes I'm a mole they've been tracing and I've been in the employ of an arms dealer, Max, for the last two years, to get him our NOC list.
What are you going to do?
I'm going to get it for him. Whoever the mole is, I think goes by the name of Job, at least part of the time. 1 can't find him, but if he knows 1 have the NOC list, he'll find me.

I can't tell you how sorry I am. I know how much Jim in particular meant to you, Ethan. Personally as well as professionally.
Yeah.
Passport, visas - you know the drill. We'll work the exfiltration thru Canada, debrief you at Langley. Throw the Prague police a bone, you know toss them a few suspects. Follow me?

You're right. Maybe this'll save some time.
For a little over two years now we've been spotting serious blowback in IMF operations. We have a penetration. The other day we decoded a message on the Internet from a Czech we know as "Max."
The arms dealer.
The arms dealer.
That's right. Max, it seems, has two unique gifts -- a capacity for anonymity and for corrupting susceptible agents. This time he's gotten to someone on the inside - he's put himself in a position to buy our NOC list. An operation he referred to as "Job 314". The job he thought Golitsyn was doing tonight.

Dad's illness was supposed to have wiped out the bank account -- dying slowly in America after all, can be a very expensive proposition Ethan. So, why don't we go quietly out of here onto the plane...

I don't have to tell you what a comfort anonymity can be in my profession -- like a warm blanket. My deal with Job was subject to a successful boot scan. Obviously it didn't pass muster. Deal's off.

Why not?
Why not?
Because I can't afford it. And because you'd burn up before you'd burn out.
How was Chicago?
Wonderful. Ran into a convention of auto dealers at the Drake Hotel. You hear the one about the astronaut who comes back from the first manned flight to Mars after two years? His wife's got a year old kid. So he says "All right. Who was it? My friend Harry?" She says no. "Oh, it was my friend Sammy." She says it wasn't Sammy.
You're going to use Walter?
He's our guy.

Isn't he chairing the Armed Services hearing?

Iíve got a shadow.
Can you lose him?

Jim, who do you think you're kidding? A doctor's gotta look at that. You can't sit up straight.
I can sit up straight. I just can't..sit up straight very well. It's not important! I saw who shot me. Ethan, I saw the mole. It was Kittridge. <i>Kittridge!</i>
Kitteridge. Oh my god! Kittridge is the mole?
Yeah.
Yeah.
How did Kittridge do it?..
..when you think about it, Ethan, it was inevitable..no more Cold War. No more secrets you keep from everyone but yourself, operations you answer to no one but yourself. Then one morning you wake up and find out the President of the United States is running the country - <i>without your permission</i>. The son-of-a- bitch! How <i>dare</i> he?

Jim...?
I was sitting in a cafe waiting for you and suddenly there she was, standing in the rain just outside the safe house..alive and beautiful..and thinking Iím dead and gone. God knows what sheís had to do forget about me to keep going and get the job done, I..
- no. She canít know about me. No one can. Not til this is over. Thereís too much at stake, Ethan.
Youíre probably right.

Before London. But after you took the Bible out of the Drake Hotel in Chicago.
They stamped it, didnít they? Those damn Gideons.
I knew about Jim.
But, he didnít know about you. In all fairness, Ethan, Claire was never convinced her charms would work with you. But I was supremely confident - having tastes the goods. "Thou shall not covet thy Neighbourís wife", Ethan. Oh, Ethan is in love with you, Claire, make no mistake about it. And like all the worldís lovers, heís tortured by the same, one pathetic
Tell me something Claire, that night in Prague, was it you or Jim that blew up the car and scattered Hannah all over town?
Keep counting Claire.
Arenít you going to thank me Jim. Ten million is better than six.
Donít flatter yourself - six was for <u>Eastern Europe</u>. You made a lousy deal - ten for the world? What is that? But I needed you for the transfer with Max. I got a little extra change; and you got a little extra too.
Sorry Ethan. Times up. Say goodbye.
Youíre wrong about one thing. Iím not the only one whoís seen you alive.
Jim, itís over.
Ethan - Iíve always taught you, nothing can be more dangerous than the truth. It can kill you.
Look to your right, then back to me. There's a camera built right into the bridge. Whatever you see it sees and transmits it back here. Can you hear me?
Of course I can hear you.
Of course I can hear you.
No, in your...ear piece. You have a lovely smile . Can you hear me now?

I was raised that a girl gets married young. I didn't get married until I was twenty-eight. I met a man. I loved him. I married him. He wanted to have a baby right away. I said no. Then he got hit by a bus. No man. No baby. No nothing! I did not know that man was a gift I could not keep.

That was my father-in-law, who has a wrong idea in his head. Listen, Johnny, there's a question I want to ask you. And I want you to tell me the truth if you can. Why do men chase women?
Well. There's the Bible story. God took a rib from Adam and made Eve. Maybe men chase women to get the rib back. When God took the rib, he left a hole there, place where there used to be something. and the women have that. Maybe a man isn't complete as a man without a woman.

You work the system right, you could ask her yourself. Just be thankful you're not working for Household. The Queen never lets them out of her sight. But wee spats like us can slip through the net, easy.
One box of biscuits, one box of drop tablets, one box of pralines, sixteen chocolate sponges. It's the same order every week, but does anybody bother to check it? Now she has to travel all the way to Balmoral without the few luxuries she actually enjoys.

She's got an army of people to get her up and out.
But I'm the only one she trusts.
She'll blow hot and cold on you, John, she always does. You want to be careful.
I'm on ninety pounds a year plus seventy pounds for a pile of tartan I'd be wearing anyway. That's as much as a Page of the Back Stairs gets and that job's only for toffs. I'm Her Majesty's Highland Servant! Indoors and Out. There's no stopping me now.
And she sent no word down?
They said you were drunk. Why don't you tell her the truth?

Well, you tell Her Majesty from me, if her husband was here now, he'd have had her out of that house and getting some air in her. What the hell's the point in me being here otherwise?!
Go inside at once.
Is that the Queen's request?
Is that the Queen's request?
Yes, it most certainly is!
She'll be away on Friday between eight o'clock and six in the evening to visit the Grants in Glasalt. If she's to make the journey there and back in the day she's to have no distractions the night before. She'll take a light supper alone in her private drawing room and retire early.

Oh.
This is the top.
The look on their faces when one walks into the room. Still gives one a ridiculous thrill.
I wouldn't know.

To have achieved one's ambition, or to have reconciled oneself to its limits, is a lifetime's work.

For Her Majesty.

Aye.

But yourself? What about John Brown?

I said. I serve the Queen.

No other aspiration?
You will not be unaware of the threat now posed by Republicanism.
Why do you think I keep her here?
Why do you think I keep her here?
Ah, but therein lies the paradox. It is her very isolation that encourages the malcontents. The longer she is away, the stronger they become; and who, honestly, can promise security against that? However many doors you lock, someone will always get in. Even here.
So...?
The truth is, the Queen would be safer doing her duty and returning south to her public. John Bull loves her and John Bull is her best defense.

You are here safely.

Aye, ma'am.

You are well?

I am.

And the pony?

She's well, too.
Your family sent cards. It was much appreciated.
I'm glad of it.
My husband was always very complimentary in speaking of you. He would have approved, I am sure, of my calling on you in this way. I trust it does not inconvenience you too much.
I've no family, ma'am, apart from my brothers and sisters.

Yes. That will be company for you.

You have been told repeatedly not to stand in the courtyard unless requested to do so.

Yes, ma'am.

Then why do you persist in doing it?
Then why do you persist in doing it?
Because I think Her Majesty is wrong. If ever there was a poor soul who needed fresh air, it is her.
The Queen will ride out if and when she chooses.
And I intend to be there when she's ready.
Prince Albert was going to build a bench here. He thought it one of the best views in Osborne.
It's a fine spot, ma'am.
It's a fine spot, ma'am.
He thought so, yes.
If Prince Albert were here today, he'd tell him a thing or two.
Sir Henry is not alone. They all wish it. The same people who refused to grant my husband the title of King because he was deemed of insufficient rank--
It is a fine spot for a bench, is it not?
Aye, ma'am.
Aye, ma'am.
Yes.
What are those?
What?

Those, over there, there.

Of course I shall say what I have to say. I always do.
Aye, well, if all you want is a good opinion then he'd be sure to oblige you.
What Mr Ponsonby was appreciating was their literary merit, a skill not intimately associated with the knowledge of grooming. Literary appreciation does not begin and end with Tennyson.
They're ready now.
I hope they didn't go to any trouble, John.

Ah, well...
We took a nip of whiskey.

Having considered my position here at court, I have come to the conclusion that it is in the best interest of Your Majesty that I should resign.

I do not accept.
I had foreseen that you would not. But Your Majesty should understand -- that my mind will not be changed in this. I leave for Deeside --
The Queen forbids it. I cannot allow it because I cannot live without you. Without you, I cannot find the strength to be who I must be. Please.
Duty?! You talk about duty?!
If duty and safety are served by the same end then, aye, I do.

-- When I took you out riding, come rain or shine, because I knew it was right for you, when I kept the bairns off your back so you could have a bit of peace, when I saw you safe from home to home and you didn't even know I was there...! All I've ever thought about is you!
Then why send me back to them?!

Because I have to!

I beg your pardon?
What can we do?
Oh, several things.
Your Majesty remains at the very epicenter of governance. As for your people, look no further than the sales of your Highland Journals to see in what affection the nation holds their Queen. You sell even more copies than Mr Dickens.
But I lack your prose, Mr Disraeli.
Then they may read about me.
Indeed, and for that they are eternally grateful.
Indeed, and for that they are eternally grateful.
Is that not enough?
Is that not enough?
In so many ways ... and yet it is your presence they crave. A figurehead.
I never thought to be bullied by you, Mr Disraeli. You, I thought, understood a widow's grief.
Forgive me, ma'am, I cannot speak for the nation, only for myself. As Prime Minister I confess I miss your presence, but that is only an expression of my own selfish desires and I should not burden you with it.
I stay here because I am happy. Is that such a terrible crime?
No, ma'am.
This is my good John Brown.
Yes.
Yes.
I have asked him to show you a little of Highland life while you are with us at Balmoral.
Should we take it seriously?
The cartoon or Her Majesty's absenteeism?

Well, both.

My dear Stanley, a Prime Minister with only a handful of friends must respect public opinion.
Gossip counts. Lord Aberdeen was right. This country is not governed by wisdom but by talk. Granted, it wouldn't take much to winkle the old girl out of mourning, but if public opinion is against her, then it doesn't do to appear too close.
So?
So?
We'll see which way the wind blows.
I see the Prince of Wales is here.
I hope he got his mother's permission.
What did he want?
To know when he'll be king.
We're going to lose.
You can't know that for sure.

In the press, perhaps. But she's sold more copies of her Highland Journal in three months than Punch will ever sell in a year. Time to wheel her out.

I was trying to imagine "rather upset."
A fine choice, sir.
Excellent!
A distinct flushing around the cheeks. She was drunk, I tell you.
No, she wasn't.
Erysipelas.
Not too protracted, I hope.

A few days... When he heard, the Prince of Wales threw the bust from the window of the Royal Gallery. It took four hours to gather the fragments.
The Queen wishes to publish an account of him.
Dear oh dear.

We think she can be dissuaded. Have you had a glance at the diary?

Quite. I think I'd best take it back.

Of course.
Where did you find it by the way?
Some young page was boasting about having seen it. Lucky.
Well, no rest for the wicked, Henry.
No, indeed.
We're expecting Brown this afternoon, ma'am.
Whom?
I'm sorry, ma'am?
Cold is good!

Excellent, ma'am, excellent. But perhaps if her Majesty were to consider accompanying her new-found physical vigor with the benefits of mental activity...

Forgive me, Your Majesty. In no way did I wish to suggest--
Forgive me, Your Majesty. In no way did I wish to suggest--
I will not tolerate anybody lecturing me about the responsibility of the monarchy....
No. You are mistaken. Prince Albert, my husband, had typhoid fever. I asked what was wrong with my son.
The same, your Majesty.
Why was I not informed?
I did not consider it wise, in the circumstances, to tax your nerves.

How ill is he?
The Royal Family and senior members of the household, ma'am.
Just them?

Yes, ma'am.
It's Mr Brown, ma'am.
What is he doing there?

A few days, ma'am.

Sir Henry, Mr Brown is standing in the courtyard. I have no wish to go riding.
I'm very sorry, ma'am. I can't imagine -- he was certainly given no instructions.

Of course, at once.
Lord Clarendon arrives, by invitation, at eleven o'clock, followed at twelve by a picnic in the grounds to celebrate Princess Alice's birthday. Dispatches, as usual, at two. The Chancellor writes to say that, by happy coincidence, he will be in Cowes for the weekend. He asks if Your Majesty might grant him an audience.
Why?
Why?
He thought, perhaps, Your Majesty might wish to be informed of the latest developments in government.

We stayed a little longer than expected with Mr and Mrs Grant. It was most agreeable.
We were expecting you to return by six.

And now I am back.

Again?
Again?
Read it!
Who told them that?
I have no idea.
I have no idea.
Why not?
Why not?
I -- forgive me, ma'am, I am no wiser than yourself.
No-one should think themselves wiser than me! It is not for any of the Queen's subjects to presume to tell Her Majesty when and where She should come out of mourning. It is the Queen's sorrow that keeps her secluded! It is Her overwhelming amount of work and responsibility, work which She feels will soon wear her out entirely!
Your Majesty --
Your Majesty --
Is it not enough that She is uncheered and unguided that she should also have to suffer these malicious rumors?! I am not a fool. I know there are those in the establishment too afraid to attack me and so they attack my dearest friends. Sometimes -- I feel that Brown is all I have left of Albert. And now they attack Brown too.
There is one other matter.
What is it?
What is it?
I have a letter, ma'am.
I have a letter, ma'am.
From whom?

From Princess Helena and other members of your family.
From Princess Helena and other members of your family.
My family is quite capable of communicating with the Queen in person.
What do they want?
They are demanding the dismissal of John Brown on grounds of drunkeness.
Ma'am?
Please tell the Princess, and other signatories to this letter, that the Queen will not be dictated to, or made to alter, in any way, what she has found to answer for her comfort. Do I make myself clear?

That's a very pretty shawl you are wearing, Alex. Silk suits you well. But you are not eating enough. One must not let vanity overrule one's appetite.
Yes, ma'am.
Where is my son?
Prince Albert is at Windsor, ma'am.

Does that thing work?
Getting there. It's more sensitive than a joy-stick. Your video-character can respond as fast as you can. But what can I do for you?
What do you mean?
It's a tough game. Hard to pin that bastard down. Keeps on changing the rules.
You've got your ten levels, right? Here they are... Each level has an exit, only remember, the exits aren't always what they seem. First one's The Blood Red Sky, then you've got The Blue Desert, Tower of Ghosts, Kingdom of the Blind... On each world you have to find a golden key and you've only got so much time to do it in. If
How do you stop The Screamer?
How do you stop The Screamer?
You can't. He gets you and you're dead. It's like time catching up with you, you know? Like Fate. Each level you get progressively less time to complete. First half of the game takes place in the Wild Lands. Then you reach Level 6, and that's the Sea of Darkness. There's a two-headed Boatman that'll take you across if you answer his riddle right.
What's the riddle?
If I tell you, then it's no fun.
If I tell you, then it's no fun.
Just tell me the fucking riddle.
Just tell me the fucking riddle.
Well...it involves a paradox. You have to trick The Boatman. Now all the while, you also have to watch your strength. You can build that back up by catching FIREFLIES...the little glowing guys...
How the hell did you do that?
Well, we're veering into classified info here, but I'll tell you that it involved a donor. He was dead of course, so it's not like anything unethical was happening.
Could you play ARCADE with that?
Well, technically "yes", but this is only the prototype.
Thanks, Albert. Think you could print up those schematics?
Sure.
We're having some problems with ARCADE...
Yeah, who isn't.
We vere thinking there might be tricks. You know, surprises that you'd worked into the game...
Sure. Every game's got 'em. I'll start with the schematics. I can print these up if you want.
The next half of the game takes place in ARCADE's brain, The City of Truth. It's urban scenarios, lots of metal and concrete. Screamer comes faster here. On Level Four you can get a free life if you wait until the last possible second before exiting that world. Gotta time it right though.
What's the question mark?
What's the question mark?
Level Ten. That's where you've got to unlock ARCADE's heart using the keys you've found.
Level Ten. That's where you've got to unlock ARCADE's heart using the keys you've found.
How do you do that?
How do you do that?
Good question. See, that's where the fun comes in. ARCADE changes it every time. He's a machine without a soul. Once you give him a soul, he stops being a threat.
But how can it change every time?
It's the game's logic core. We actually patterned it after human brainwaves. I mean, there's a personality in there. That's what makes it so incredible.
Dead?
Well, brain-dead anyway. Coma patient. It's really not all that important.
Well, brain-dead anyway. Coma patient. It's really not all that important.
Maybe he's not dead.

He?

The donor. Maybe he's alive inside the game.

And maybe you've been taking too many drugs.
Nick, Alex, how are we today?
How'd you know it was us?
How'd you know it was us?
Security camera. Pulled your files before I came down. Be careful what you say, kids ... I know where you live.
Now what seems to be the problem?
It's the game, ARCADE.
It's the game, ARCADE.
You don't like it?
If this is a joke, I'm not laughing.
Neither are we. Something's wrong with the game, Mr. Difford.
Neither are we. Something's wrong with the game, Mr. Difford.
Why don't we take this into my office.
Talk to me.
There's something wrong with ARCADE. The game's alive somehow...
He thinks I'm "sublimating".
What the hell does that mean?
Has anyone seen Greg?
He's probably outside. You know how he is. Gets bored...
Sick?
Everybody's sick, huh? It's fifteen after. We always meet here, you know that.
Everybody's sick, huh? It's fifteen after. We always meet here, you know that.
What's her problem?
What's her problem?
Did you play ARCADE last night?
Did you play ARCADE last night?
Actually, no. I was just telling Nick, here, that my t.v.'s busted...
Liar. Did you come from the city on the left, or the city on the right?
I came from the city on the left.
I came from the city on the left.
But you always lie, so you didn't come from there. That means the city on the left must be the City of Truth.
So where is he?
Guess he took off... You have his keys, right?
Hmmm. He said you were going to have dinner?
Yeah...
Yeah...
So take his car home. Wait. I'm sure he's up to something...
So take his car home. Wait. I'm sure he's up to something...
But he was playing the game. I mean, you saw him...
Hello?
Hey, kid.
Nick...
Have you played the game yet? It's incredible! I was just...
Have you played the game yet? It's incredible! I was just...
Listen to me! Greg never came home. I think the game has something to do with it.
Listen to me! Greg never came home. I think the game has something to do with it.
What the hell are you talking about?
I have to talk to you.
We are talking...
We are talking...
No, in person. Now.
No, in person. Now.
It's twelve-thirty!
It's twelve-thirty!
I'm coming over.
Alex, you don't know how long I've waited for this.
Funny.
What do you mean by "weird"?
Greg never came home. A few hours is one thing, Nick, but this is different. Something's happened to him.
Can you turn off the game?
I'm in the middle of it...
I'm in the middle of it...
Turn if off!
Happy?
No. Look, I know you're not going to believe me, but listen anyway... I think the game's alive somehow.
No, wait. Just listen. I hooked it up earlier tonight, and it said my name. As soon as I turned it on, Nick. It said my name. How could it know? And then, I asked it where Greg was, and it said, "In here".
Alex, I think you're freaking out. Greg's gone, I'll give you that. And maybe he's in trouble. But it's not ARCADE that's doing it...
Alex, I think you're freaking out. Greg's gone, I'll give you that. And maybe he's in trouble. But it's not ARCADE that's doing it...
It is.
It is.
How?! It's a machine, Alex. Machine's don't think. They're not alive. It's a good program, a brilliant program, it was designed so it would act as if it were alive, but it's not alive.
How?! It's a machine, Alex. Machine's don't think. They're not alive. It's a good program, a brilliant program, it was designed so it would act as if it were alive, but it's not alive.
So how did it know my name, then?
So how did it know my name, then?
You imagined it.
See, men always do this. "Quiet down, honey. Chill out. Take a Valium". I'm not a fucking idiot, Nick! I DID NOT IMAGINE IT!!!
Quiet. I do have parents, you know.
It turned itself back on, Nick.
No it didn't. It's just a faulty relay or something. It happens.
Sorry. Maybe I need the Valium.
Call the others. Laurie, Benz...
Something's happened to them.
It's the middle of the night. They're asleep. Phone didn't wake them.
It's the middle of the night. They're asleep. Phone didn't wake them.
All of them?
Because I didn't know where else to go.
It's two o'clock in the morning. Go home. Go to sleep. We'll figure something out in the morning.
It's not this weird. It'll make sense. Everything gets weird this late anyway, right?
Sure.
We have to find out what's happened to them. I think they're gone...
No way.
No way.
If they're sick, great. But let's make sure. Come on, Nick.
If they're sick, great. But let's make sure. Come on, Nick.
Okay. We'll see what's up. But if things are cool, I don't want to hear anything more about this. Life's too short, know what I mean?
Well?
She thought Benz was at school.
Where to now?
Laurie's.
This is like a movie or something. I mean, am I paranoid or what?
It doesn't necessarily mean she's...
It doesn't necessarily mean she's...
Let's go around back.
Change the channel!
What?!
Then leave her.
We can't...
We can't...
We'll call 911. Look around Alex. We broke in, smashed the t.v., no one's going to believe what happened here!
Where do we go?
My house. I want to try something.
That's what I thought.
What?
What?
It's not just the cable system. It's in the phone system as well, the electronic net. It's everywhere.
It's not just the cable system. It's in the phone system as well, the electronic net. It's everywhere.
Nick, what is it.
Nick, what is it.
Maybe it is alive in a way...some sort of electronic intelligence. It's like a computer virus that developed a personality or something. It's self-replicating...it mimics life.

It's growing. Getting stronger. Maybe it's only localized now...
...but then it hits the relay stations...

Right. And then communication satellites, and then anywhere.

It's already out.

Give me a break, Alex. What are we going to tell them? Excuse me, officer, but there's some sort of electronic monster loose in the phone lines. I'd think twice about calling any of those 976 numbers...
Give me a break, Alex. What are we going to tell them? Excuse me, officer, but there's some sort of electronic monster loose in the phone lines. I'd think twice about calling any of those 976 numbers...
Then where do we go?!
Then where do we go?!
I don't know.
SLIP-STREAM.
What?
What?
They made ARCADE. It's still a game, right? It thinks like a game. Maybe it still has to play by the rules. Someone had to program it in the first place, didn't they?.
You mean we learn the rules...
And beat it at it's own game.
And beat it at it's own game.
You realize that in order to do that, we'd actually have to play the game.
You realize that in order to do that, we'd actually have to play the game.
I was afraid you'd say that.
Virgin sacrifices?
Drives 'em crazy every time.
What Alex is trying to say is that it "seems" like it's alive.
No I'm not...
No I'm not...
We're not getting very far into the levels and we kind of thought maybe we could talk to a programmer, learn some tricks and stuff... I mean, you don't want us kids running around school saying your game's too hard, right?
Go outside, get your car, and meet me out front with the engine running. And make it quick, okay?
What are you going to do?
What are you going to do?
Get that helmet. If we're going to play ARCADE, I want every advantage possible.
Jesus Christ!
I can't believe you made it!
You got the schematics?
Everything.
I've been thinking about that. ARCADE's like a virus, so it seems like the place to hit him would be where the virus started. You know, like his point of origin?
Dante's Inferno.
Dante's Inferno.
Yeah. The Inferno.
Alex...
You didn't hear me?
What are you looking for?
A way to hook this helmet into the game. I'm sure there are interfaces...
I don't understand. It wants us to play the game. It's been taunting us ...
Put in a quarter.
Put in a quarter.
It can turn itself on, Alex! It doesn't need a quarter.
It can turn itself on, Alex! It doesn't need a quarter.
Yes it does. Don't you see? We have to play by the rules. That's what it wants.
You're not coming, Alex.
Yes I am...
Yes I am...
I know how to do this! I'm good at these games. You never play, you'd be nailed in an instant.
I know how to do this! I'm good at these games. You never play, you'd be nailed in an instant.
And what if something happens to you? Am I suppose to go in after you alone?!
And what if something happens to you? Am I suppose to go in after you alone?!
No. If you're smart, you run like hell.
You don't get it, do you?
What?
What?
I don't want anything to happen to you. I care about you.
I don't want anything to happen to you. I care about you.
I already have a boyfriend, Nick.
I already have a boyfriend, Nick.
I know. It sucks.
You feel it? It's different this time.
We're actually inside, aren't we?
Okay. Give us a kiss?
One. In case...
One. In case...
Don't even say it.
Thanks. Always wanted to do that.
Yeah, well I figure these are unusual circumstances.
Yeah, well I figure these are unusual circumstances.
That's what I was hoping you'd say.
I'll take the lead and handle the physical threats. You watch the elapsed time and look for exits.
Got it.
Which way do you think Level Two is?
You've got the schematics, check.
Okay. It's West.
The keys are supposed to be at the end of each level. Once we get all the keys, we can unlock ARCADE's heart. And then...
The clock's already ticking.
Right, then...
And we've still got time left. This was a piece of cake.
Yeah, that's what worries me.
Hey, my strength's low. Look out for Fireflies.
There...
Shit...
Check your read-out.
Our time's up.
What?! There's nothing here!
What?! There's nothing here!
Look around...
What the fuck is that?!
Screamer.
We can't reach that!
We don't have a choice!
So that's what we almost died for?
One of them, anyway... Did you see it? The Screamer?
One of them, anyway... Did you see it? The Screamer?
I don't want to talk about it.
Christ...no time...
There never is.
We can take the dunes down like a ski slope. Pretend you're on a snowboard.
Never been on a snowboard.
What is it?
I just thought of something. If we came back from the game... ...what if ARCADE did too?
Listen to me, Alex. These counselor's don't know anything. They're full of shit. If you don't fit the pattern of the perfect kid, they freak.
I know.
I know.
So tell me you're okay, then.
So tell me you're okay, then.
I'm okay.
I'm okay.
Good. Cause I'd freak if you weren't.
Come on. We'll hit Dante's after school, try the game out, maybe get some dinner.
And then keep on driving?
And then keep on driving?
Sure. Never come back. Disappear forever.
Go for it.
Hold my keys, then.
So how did you do it, Alex?
Well, it's a long story...
How did you get here? Did you play the game?!
Yes...
Yes...
Thought so.
Then we'll go home?
Then we'll go home.
Which way?
That way.
It's the wrong way!
In this world, wrong is right!
It's here!!!
Oh God...oh god...
What did he do to you?
Is that your question?
Is that your question?
Wait! No! That's not it!
Think! I want to go to the City of Truth, and the Truth Teller is from there...but which one is which? The liar...think!
You have no time. What is your question?
You have no time. What is your question?
I'm thinking!
I'm thinking!
You have no time.
Mom? You're alive...
Of course I am.
Of course I am.
But I don't understand...
But I don't understand...
I miss you so much, Alex. I want so much to be with you...
I love you, Alex. I never wanted to leave. You know that, don't you?
Yes...but...how did you...
Is...is that where we are? Did I die?
Not yet, honey...
We're glad you people could make it, and we're anxious to have you try out our new product. We think it's going to be a big seller. But you're the people that make it happen. You're the market share everyone's tearing each other apart to get at. It's your opinion that's going to make or break us.
So what's so different about Arcade? You guys've been talking about it for months.
A man after my own heart. Straight to the point. What's different about ARCADE is the way it reacts. It responds like a human does. It learns. It adapts. Each time you play, it changes its strategy.
That's impossible.
That's impossible.
Is it? Why don't you see for your self?
"Escape"?
In case things get too intense. It automatically freezes the game, gives you a breather. Things can get pretty wild...
So what's the scenario? Am I saving a princess? Fighting Zombies?
It changes. There are eleven levels. Each one is a different layer of the ARCADE universe. The concept is, you're entering the video game itself, making your way across the circuit board to the logic core ... ARCADE's brain.

So how do I start?
So how do I start?
The game will guide you.
So what do you think?
Sign me up.
This is one of our newest projects. We're trying to get rid of joy-sticks altogether ...
The Air-Force is working on the same thing.
It means she's screwed up.
Fucked up. That's what they said I was.
Cool.
Can you say anything but "cool"?
Can you say anything but "cool"?
Of course I can. I can say all sorts of things...
One of these cities, is the place you seek. The Teller of Truths will take you there. But the City of Lies, is dark and bleak. And death is certain if you enter, beware.
I am The Liar. Where should I take you?
I am The Liar. Where should I take you?
I am the Truth Teller. Where should I take you?
So start at the beginning...
Give her a chance, will you?

I am giving her a chance. Why don't you get off my back?

I know. Where are you Adam?
What do you mean "you know"?

Beverly Hills Hotel. I've got enough cash in my pocket for one night.
Do you know somebody called the The Cowboy?
The Cowboy??
The Cowboy??
Yeah, the Cowboy. This guy, the Cowboy, wants to see you. Jason said he thought it would be a good idea.
Yeah, the Cowboy. This guy, the Cowboy, wants to see you. Jason said he thought it would be a good idea.

It's been a very strange day.
It's been a very strange day.
And getting stranger. Where do I meet this Cowboy? I mean do I have to ride out to the range?
And getting stranger. Where do I meet this Cowboy? I mean do I have to ride out to the range?
Sort of, funny boy. If I tell him the meeting's on you're to go to the top of Beachwood Canyon. There's a corral up there where he'll be.

Yeah, sure. It is that kind of a day. When?
Yeah, sure. It is that kind of a day. When?
I'll call him, then call you back...If you want you could stay at my place.
Cynthia... that would not be a good idea.
I'm just offering a place to stay.

I understand, Cynthia and thank you for the offer. I'll find a place. Now go ahead and give the Cowboy a yodel and get back to me.

Git along little dowgie and call me back.
So what's the problem?
There is no problem.
There is no problem.
So why did you idiots bring me here? ... I'm in the middle of making a picture.
We'd be happy to put her in the pile for considerations ... you'd be pleased to know there's quite a lot of interest in this role.
Interest?! There's six of the top actresses that want this thing.
You'd better fix this, Ray!!!
I'll speak to someone.
I'll speak to someone.
And you'd better speak to someone too ... or find yourself another client!! This smells like a set-up to me! And by the way, Ray, I don't know who these guys are kidding, but every foot of film I've shot is in a vault at the lab that only I can access. No one's getting that film!!
Howdy!
Howdy to you.
Beautiful night.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Sure want to thank ya for drivin' all the way up to see me from that Beverly Hills Hotel.

That a man's attitude determines to a large extent how his life will be.

So since you agree I guess you could be a person who does not care about the good life.

Okay.
Okay.
Now I know a few things. I know you have had a rough day. You're probably thinkin' I don't know the half of it, but in actual fact I know every part of it. The business of gittin' thrown off your movie, the heartache of seeing your wife with another man... losin' access to that precious film vault...
It will work out.
Good then, but, just in case, that bank's gonna stay closed a bit longer. You understand that?

Unbelievable. Look... here. I don't know what's going on. That's so much baloney. I've got enough cash for one night, okay?
Unbelievable. Look... here. I don't know what's going on. That's so much baloney. I've got enough cash for one night, okay?
That's fine, Mr. Kesher. You can pay cash when you check out. I'm sorry. it was my duty to inform you.
That's fine, Mr. Kesher. You can pay cash when you check out. I'm sorry. it was my duty to inform you.
Fine. I'll check out in the morning.
Fine. I'll check out in the morning.
Have a good evening, Mr. Kesher.
I guess it was your grandfather, was it ... he called me to check in, said you were on your way and for you to call when you get in. Nice man... farmer I hear.
Yes, he is. He raises corn.
Yes, he is. He raises corn.
Damn lot of corn raised in Hollywood these days too.

Well, I ...
Well, I ...
You don't have to tell me. It's written all over that pretty face of yours.. You came here to be an actress. I just hope you'll remember there's never been a great poem called "tits and ass."
I...
You probably don't remember her, but Louise Bonner lives right over there in number 29. When she isn't drunk she runs a damn good acting class.

Have many famous actors and actresses lived here? I was meaning to ask you that.
Have many famous actors and actresses lived here? I was meaning to ask you that.
Honey, all the great ones came through here at one time or another.
I guess I've come to quite a place.
Sweetheart, you don't know the half of it.
No, I don't.
That's good. They're allowed, but I don't like 'em...for obvious reasons. One man used to live here that had a prize fighting kangaroo. You wouldn't believe what that kangaroo did to this courtyard ... let's see your Aunt's apartment ... it's a good one.

I can hardly wait, Coco.
It's unbelievable!
I told ya.
I told ya.
Wow!
Wow!
Now I guess you and your Aunt have an understanding. So here's the key and you need anything, just give a holler. Everybody in this building's pretty much okay with me or they wouldn't be here. If you want, later I'll introduce you around. No hard feelings if you don't, and don't forget the rooftop garden. It's just up the stairs we passed. It's

Oh Coco thank you. Thank you so much.

You got it! See you later honey.
Your Aunt called me.
I was afraid of that.
I was afraid of that.
She wants to know who's staying in her apartment.
She wants to know who's staying in her apartment.
It's just for a night or two, until she finds her own place. I tried to explain that to Aunt Ruth, but the connection was bad and her plane was leaving and she got it all mixed up. I kept telling her it was my friend and she kept saying she didn't know any Ritas ...

Sweetie, look at me straight.
Coco...she's very nice. We went to school together.
So I guess your Grandpa and Grandma know her.
So I guess your Grandpa and Grandma know her.
Not really. I met her in junior college and she was from this other town.
You're really something Coco...thank you.
Don't make me out to be a sucker. Louise Bonner says there's trouble in there. You remember last night. Sometimes she's wrong, but if there is trouble - get rid of it.
Sorry to trouble you, Coco.
It's all right gorgeous. Something wrong?
It's all right gorgeous. Something wrong?
No, no. I'm on my way to my audition. Before I go I wanted to ask you if you could remember the man's name ... Aunt Ruthie's friend who helped put this together. It completely went out of my mind.
No, no. I'm on my way to my audition. Before I go I wanted to ask you if you could remember the man's name ... Aunt Ruthie's friend who helped put this together. It completely went out of my mind.
His name's Wally Brown .... great guy. Been in the business since forever.

Naw! He wouldn't have cared. Just give him a good performance and he'll be happy and I've got a feeling you'll do just that.
Naw! He wouldn't have cared. Just give him a good performance and he'll be happy and I've got a feeling you'll do just that.

Get going. You don't want to be late.
Right. See ya.
Right. See ya.
Good luck, honey!
That's okay.
I'm Ruth's niece. My name's Betty. I'm sure she told you I was coming.
There was an accident. I came here.
I understand. I saw the dress. I...I'm sorry. Are you all right?
A car ... a car accident.
Are you okay?
Are you okay?
I think so. I was just taking a shower.
I think so. I was just taking a shower.
Oh my god. I'm sorry. I'll let you get back to that. I'm going to get unpacked.
My name is Rita.
Hi...do you work with my Aunt?
Betty Elms?
Yes.
Yes.
I'm Wally Brown. Your Aunt is a very dear friend of mine so it's particularly nice to meet you.

Very pleased to meet you.

Come in. I'd like you to meet everyone.
Hi.
Well. Shall we get to it? Would you like a water or a coffee before we begin?
No, no, I'm fine.
Well then, take a seat everyone. Betty why don't you join Jimmy and we'll play the scene. Is there anything you'd like to say Bob... something to Betty before they begin?
Just tell me where it hurts, baby.
What?
What?
I want to play this one close, Bob. Like it was with that girl, what's her name, with the black hair. That felt good. Whaddya think?
Betty.
Yeah ... Betty. You don't rush it. I don't rush it. We play it close, just like in the movies.
You're still here?
I came back. I thought that's what you wanted.
I can call them... I can call my dad.
But you won't.
Stop... just stop! That's what you said from the beginning. If I tell what happened... they'll arrest you and put you in jail, so get out of here before...
Before what?
Hi. I'm inquiring ...well, I heard a sound last night that sounded like a car crash and I want to know if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive.
Yes, there was.
Yes, there was.
Can you tell me what happened?
Can you tell me what happened?
No. I can't.
No. I can't.
Was anyone hurt?

But it said #12.
But it said #12.
I switched apartments with her. She's in #17. Just walk down that way. It's just to the right.
Well ... we'll leave her a note.
I'll go with you. She's still got some of my stuff.
No ..........I.
I...I mean......I...it's none of my business.
I...I mean......I...it's none of my business.
She has pretty red hair... she is very kind I think.
She has pretty red hair... she is very kind I think.
She sure is. She's letting me stay here while she's working on a movie that's being made in Canada, but I guess you know that. I couldn't afford a place like this in a million years. Unless of course I'm discovered and become a movie star. Of course, I'd rather be known as a great actress than a movie star, but sometimes people end
