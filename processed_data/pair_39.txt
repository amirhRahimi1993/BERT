To make sure youre okay.
You know all that if these walls could talk stuff? Do you believe it? That a place has a memory?
Actually, I do.
It was such a long time ago.
Still--
Still--
If Ed ever found out....
If Ed ever found out....
Or Kat....
Or Kat....
And she wonders why I swim to the bottom of a Lemondrop every time I see her.
Youd better get going. My parents will be round to cart you off to the country.
Whatever you do, dont mention Italy. Or politics. Or baby buggies. Or Edith Piaf.
Whatever you do, dont mention Italy. Or politics. Or baby buggies. Or Edith Piaf.
Your probably best off pretending youre asleep.
Say something. Please.
I knew you were still seeing someone else when we finally got together. I never in a million years would have dreamt it was Jeffrey.
Does Kat know?
Jeffrey told her last night.
Jeffrey told her last night.
Last night?
Wheres Nick sleeping?
Why, with you.
Why, with you.
My mother has a rule about men and women sleeping in the same room without a ring in the picture. She thinks its--
Huh?
Im not as square as my daughter thinks.
Moms refining her strategy for DDay.
Im sure General Eisenhower never had to master the finer points of the seating chart and centerpieces. Oh, and tomorrow afternoon you are carpooling to the country with the Fletcher-Wootens.
Im sure General Eisenhower never had to master the finer points of the seating chart and centerpieces. Oh, and tomorrow afternoon you are carpooling to the country with the Fletcher-Wootens.
Sir, yes, sir!
Id be happy to. Youre welcome.
Oh, dont be that way.
I blame Tony Pee-Pants!
Oh, no. She tells this story at every major holiday.
Oh, no. She tells this story at every major holiday.
Why should this be any different? Besides, I have to initiate Nick into the family.
She blames Tony Pee-Pants Pinterello for everything. The fall of the British Empire, the Cold War, the internet.
It was just after we moved here. My little girls got in a fight over Tony Pee-Pants and they havent made up since.
Im an American and in America, people sue. So to prevent a lawsuit, I baked a tart. And I dont bake.
So Dad rang the bell and when Tony Pee-Pants opened the door, I threw the tart at him and popped his stitches.
Whats going on with you two?
I was pretty hard on her last night. And now shes getting married.
I was pretty hard on her last night. And now shes getting married.
Theres a reason I always tell that Tony Pee-Pants story, you know.

Trust me. This is bigger than Tony Pee-Pants.
Trust me. This is bigger than Tony Pee-Pants.
Before Tony, you and your sister were best friends. I couldnt split you up. If your sister ate the spinach, you ate the spinach. If you threw up--.

Mom, please.
Mom, please.
Anyway, when that boy came over, it was the first time you ever did anything without her. And Amy wasnt just jealous...she was sad and lonely. She missed you.
Anyway, when that boy came over, it was the first time you ever did anything without her. And Amy wasnt just jealous...she was sad and lonely. She missed you.
She did?
She did?
So she flirted with Tony, and you got mad and sent him away. Who did that leave? You and Amy. Reunited.
Whos ever heard of dance lessons for a wedding, honestly?
Um, just about everyone.
Um, just about everyone.
You are taking the piss?
Just because some slags been paid for, doesnt mean youve got to...you know.
Its been my experience that the people who hire a prostitute, need a prostitute. You did the right thing.
I think I love you, mate. How do you know so much about so much?
Im a hooker.
I thought you said you were crap.
I had to say something to get you here.
I had to say something to get you here.
Fair enough, but Im stepping on toes here and youre waltzing around like...
Ill just check into a hotel.
Dont be ridiculous. Its late and the place is empty. Just take my car.
I look like a total wanker, dont I?
Yeah, kind of.
You heading to the train station?
I figured you could pick up your car tomorrow.
I figured you could pick up your car tomorrow.
Yeah.
Whats his problem?
What?
What?
Theres something about him thats just a bit odd.
Theres something about him thats just a bit odd.
Other than, hes shagging your exgirlfriend?
Other than, hes shagging your exgirlfriend?
No, thats not it.
Remember when we went hiking in the lake district and Amy was wearing that little bikini thing.
No.
No.
It was before you started going out. We had lunch at that inn on the lake.

Oh, yes. Right. The Rat and Parrot.

And Kat was fully clothed.

But, somehow, it was Kats arse that was stung by nettles. And you rubbed it with a dandelion leaf.

Thats when I realized I wanted to be a doctor.
Thats when I realized I wanted to be a doctor.
Oh, shut up. Youre an optician.
Oh, shut up. Youre an optician.
Lasik surgeon, actually.
I didnt deserve her back then.
And you do now?
Nothing.
Doesnt look like nothing.
Hey.
Oh, hello.
Ah, a philosopher.
Shrink, actually.
Shrink, actually.
Crikey.
Crikey.
What?
What?
Nothing, nothing.
Nothing, nothing.
No, tell me.
No, tell me.
You Yanks and your therapy. Its great. Its all a bit too touchy-feely for me.
Hey, man.
Sorry, can you give us a moment?
Sorry, can you give us a moment?
No, I cant. Were late for a dance lesson. I guess youll have to finish up later.
Why, Jeffrey. Hello.
Hello, Katmandu.
Seeing you again....
Yeah?
Hey, Kat.
Hey, yourself. I see youve met my ex.
Hey, you!
Let me guess. Amy presumed Id forget the rings. I think Im her least favorite person. You know, I am sorry.
Let me guess. Amy presumed Id forget the rings. I think Im her least favorite person. You know, I am sorry.
Maybe not her least... Theres always--
So, tell me, hows unmarried life?
I have regrets.
Whoa, Jeffrey. Slow down. You and me, were the past. Im not sure if you noticed, but Im here with someone else.
Kat, we must talk. This guy, theres something not quite right.
Kat, we must talk. This guy, theres something not quite right.
Its called character. God, youre predictable.
Its called character. God, youre predictable.
Is that why you brought him? Because of me.
Kat, wait. I dont want you hating me. Weve never had this talk. You know how crap I am at this.
Um, news flash: I dont give a shit.
Um, news flash: I dont give a shit.
Kat, stop it. You do. You cant even look me in the eye. You went back to the States when we split up.
That was a long time ago.
It was. And it took your sister getting married to get you back here.
It was. And it took your sister getting married to get you back here.
So, whats your point?
So, whats your point?
I should have told you why I broke up with you. I was a coward. You deserve to know.
You were so good to me. I swear I never meant to hurt you. We were together what, five years?
Seven if you count the on-and-off years. Which I do.
Seven if you count the on-and-off years. Which I do.
Right. Seven. Christ, thats a long time, isnt it?
Right. Seven. Christ, thats a long time, isnt it?
Not for a dog.
Not for a dog.
Well, we had a lot of good years, but then...
Is this supposed to be an apology?
Its not supposed to be anything, Kat. Its just my rather feeble attempt to.... Oh, I dont know. You see, I thought I could deny my feelings--
Youre not even listening.
When we were together I was too here, now Im not here enough.
Bollocks, Im sorry. I had no idea this would be so difficult.
Relax. Take a breath and just say it. Its no big deal. I promise.
Relax. Take a breath and just say it. Its no big deal. I promise.
Brilliant.
Brilliant.
Well, it was a big deal. As late as...yesterday. Or this morning. But not anymore.
Its the past. Its nothing but ghosts. So just get it off your chest, then lets go back upstairs and eat some tiramisu.
I slept with your sister.
Im sorry?
I shagged Amy. Two years ago. Thats why I ended it. And then, after you left, sod it, we kept at it like rabbits until we both realized it was absolutely mad. And, you know, morally wrong. Then there was that one other time. And that was it.
Hi. Hey.
Kat.
You think we look like were trying too hard.
Exactly. I want us to look like we fit, but not like were trying too hard to look like we fit. Its welcome cocktails, not prom. With this level of matchy-matchy, we should be drinking peach schnapps under a bleacher somewhere.
What color are my shoes?
You have feet?
Dont patronize me. Theyve clearly been at this a while.
Youre funny.
Youre funny.
Yeah, but I feel like crap. And if you feel like crap, its way better to look hot while youre doing it.
Mission accomplished.
Really? Dont get too attached.
Mmm.
Mmm, nice dress? Or mmm-- Gorgeous, I was insane to let you go!
Mmm, nice dress? Or mmm-- Gorgeous, I was insane to let you go!
Both.
You know, they say you can tell everything you need to know about a person from the way they act when theyre naked.
I dont do naked. My sister? She does naked.
The Knicks game? We both wanted the last hot dog?
Oh, yeah. So we split it. You know, as in share. People do that.
Well, he looks miserable. What were you talking about?
Love.
Jeffrey knows love like he knows macramé.
He was pretty drunk, but I think hes still crazy about you.
He was pretty drunk, but I think hes still crazy about you.
Of course he is. Im here with my new man. I love it! Your magics already working. Let the suffering begin.
What did he say exactly? I mean, you dont think he wants me back?
I dont know.
I dont know.
What does your gut say?
What does your gut say?
Youre too good for him.
No, count it, anyway.
Why?
Why?
Im compulsive and weird?
Six thousand, right?
On the nose. I tell you what, because youre so cute, Ill take care of our incidentals.

How does it feel to get that much money just for being you?
How does it feel to get that much money just for being you?
Great, with the occasional stabs of shame. Now, listen, this covers the weekend, but as we discussed, if you want to be intimate, we talk money before anything happens.
Great, with the occasional stabs of shame. Now, listen, this covers the weekend, but as we discussed, if you want to be intimate, we talk money before anything happens.
That wont be an issue, believe me. I find the idea of sex for money morally repugnant. No offense.
That wont be an issue, believe me. I find the idea of sex for money morally repugnant. No offense.
Its okay. Hell, Ive never paid for it. But please dont feel like you have to explain yourself to me.
You quitting?
Im desperate to start but I dont have an addictive personality. Except for approval. That, I cant get enough of.
Who are they?
Graham Russell and Russell Hitchcock.
What?
Its cute.
Its cute.
What is?
What is?
You stand on your tiptoes.
You stand on your tiptoes.
I do?
Have you ever done anything like this before?
A weekend?
A weekend?
A wedding.
Not the way youre thinking. The women wanted me there for support. You can understand that.
I think thats disgusting.
Not you. Youre not disgusting. Youre lovely. Just the idea that theyd bring an escort. I mean, a stranger who, um, didnt...who never.... I mean, someones dead.
Thats right. Imagine facing it alone.
Sorry. Im a little nervous. I never thought something like this would happen to me.
This happened to you?
This happened to you?
Well, happen, in the sense that I picked up the phone, tracked you down, flew you here and gave you six grand out of my 401K.
How did you know that was me?
I have a friend at the magazine.

Your friend guaranteed my anonymity.
Your friend guaranteed my anonymity.
If it makes you feel any better, to get your number, I had to cough up two round-trip tickets to Amsterdam and a case of mini-Baileys.
Would you grab my shampoo?
Shampoo, got it!
The real story is that my mother was a hippie. And a stripper. She was insanely inappropriate with me. She used to wash her lingerie in my bathwater. While I was still in the bath.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Yeah. As an adult, I needed to find some way to experience intimacy and sex, but with rules that couldnt be violated.
You shit!
I have a different story for every woman who asks. I look at her and figure out what she needs to hear to feel okay about being with me.

And you thought Id respond to the hippie stripper with no boundaries?
And you thought Id respond to the hippie stripper with no boundaries?
Admit it. You were disturbed, but ultimately moved.
So...what was I...oh, yeah. Do you honestly think that I want to be single and miserable? That I want to be obsessed with some asshole who led me on for years then -- out of the blue -- shattered my heart.
First of all, its never out of the blue. And second of all--
Yes.
What?!
What?!
When youre ready to let go, to be unsingle and unmiserable, you will. Until then....
Are you asking me if Im gay for pay?
I guess so.
I guess so.
What do you think?
Theres a guy on 81st and Madison. You get your results in 24 hours. Do you make your lovers get tested before you sleep with them?
My sixth-grade science project was entitled, Love Hurts: The Heartbreak of Human Papillomavirus. Trust me, Im careful.
I love that youre asking questions, but do you really want to get into all of this?
This is awkward for me. Talking about it makes me feel better.
Dont stop asking questions, okay?
Okay.
I swear. I dont have a signature move.
Oh, come on. Youre like the Yoda of escorts.
Subtle?
I disappear. Its not about me.
Its hard to explain.
Show me.
Come on.
Ive got this bad taste in my mouth. What is it? I think its the words: morally repugnant.
Are you sure?
We kissed. Made out a little. Then you passed out.
Is this for last night?
Of course not. How...how could it be? Nothing happened.
Of course not. How...how could it be? Nothing happened.
If I was going to charge you, I would have told you beforehand. I thought I explained that.
Dont they have a limit at those machines?
Not if you take an advance on your credit card.
So youre telling me. If something had happened last night...it would have cost me fourteen hundred dollars? Thats a down payment on a Ford Focus!
Not dollars. Pounds.
And what if I didnt want you to...to do that to me?
No, no. The three hundred is for you doing it to me.
No, no. The three hundred is for you doing it to me.
What?
What?
Believe me, if anything had happened, that would have been one of the highlights. For you.
Believe me, if anything had happened, that would have been one of the highlights. For you.
But nothing did.
But nothing did.
Yup. Thats why you get to keep your money.
Hello, goodbye, I want you, I hate you. Its all just words. None of it means anything. What matters is what you do. You either stay put or you walk away. If you look back, youre not walking away!
Oh, cut the crap!
Oh, cut the crap!
I just hate seeing you so stuck.
I just hate seeing you so stuck.
He was about to un-stick me! I paid you to help me get closure.
He was about to un-stick me! I paid you to help me get closure.
You paid me for a lot of reasons. Closure wasnt one of them.
Im sorry I was such a bitch. I really appreciate your doing this.
Its my job.
You have had girlfriends?
Sure, but its never easy. They say theyre okay with it, and they are...for a while. Then one day, theyre not.
When I said Id never done a wedding before, I didnt say that no one ever asked. I just never said yes.
So, whyd you say yes to me?
So, whyd you say yes to me?
There was something in your voice on the phone that day.
There was something in your voice on the phone that day.
Desperation?
What would you do if you weren't an escort?
Make out with you for free.
What would you do if you stopped worrying about what other people think?
Spontaneously combust?
Yeah. You?
Yeah.
Fourteen and hes hoodwinked by a an erector set?
I didnt say he was worth it.
And thats when he peed in his pants? After the tart?
He bled a bunch, but no, there was no peeing.
He bled a bunch, but no, there was no peeing.
So whats with the nickname?
Besides, you hired me for my discretion.
Youve always got that to hide behind, dont you? Its just business!
Youve always got that to hide behind, dont you? Its just business!
Yeah! For all I know, come Monday morning, well go back to the real world and...and youll be hiring me for your best friend!
You let me make a fool of myself! You lied to me! I dont know why that surprises me because lying is what you do. Its your job. Its who you are. How would you even know if something were real?
Youre judging me?! Oh, thats a good one. Youre lying to me, youre lying to your family, and youre lying to yourself. But youre going to stand there and point a finger at me? The man you hired to pretend to be your boyfriend?
Youre right. I was so desperate to make everyone believe I was happy that I spent six grand on a lie. And after all that? The only one who ended up falling for it was me.
Go ahead, Kat. Hate me. You were running out of steam on the whole Jeffrey thing. Maybe now youll be able to hold onto this just long enough to ruin your next relationship.
Hi.
Hi.
I should go.
What?! No, no. You cant--
What?! No, no. You cant--
I have to. Im the best man.
Nice speech. I thought it was touching... and funny.
Thank you.
Kat Ellis! We live two hundred miles away from each other but I have to fly all the way to London to see you. You havent visited me once in D.C. Where the hell have you been? I have gynecologists that call more often.
You have more than one gynecologist?
You have more than one gynecologist?
Sure. Youve got to play them against each other. Otherwise they think youre easy.
You didnt have to do that.
I wasnt saving you from him. I was saving you from yourself.
Whats he do anyway?
Therapist.
Like fifteen.
Dad made me go over and apologize the next day.
Oh, no. He told you.
You knew?
You knew?
Im so sorry.
Hey, Sal.
I heard you were back in town, kitty cat. Youre here for the highland flings, I bet.
I heard you were back in town, kitty cat. Youre here for the highland flings, I bet.
I get all the glamour jobs.
The one I made for you is the cherries. You hang onto it or give it back?
Give it back? Are you nuts?
Give it back? Are you nuts?
You pawned it.
You pawned it.
Not exactly. I wear it. On my right hand. And only rarely.
You want I nut him in the boat?
Yes? No. What? Save the patter for the tourists.
Yes? No. What? Save the patter for the tourists.
You want me to let him in?
You want me to let him in?
Of course, dont be silly.
Dad!
Hi, kiddo.
Hi, kiddo.
Meet Nick.
Thats not true. We checked for leaks a few years back. Good morning.
Ahoy!
So whyd you let him go?
Its complicated, Dad.
Its complicated, Dad.
Oh, well, then. It probably wont work out.
Yeah.
Then for once in your life, do something for yourself.
Im worried. Amys not good at drinking. She gets sooo drunk sooo fast. Does free alcohol get you less drunk or more drunker? Is it drunker or drunker-er?
Just drunk enough.
Not yet...
...but its getting there. 
I thought you were living in San Francisco. Or was it Nepal?
Close. Sydney. Turns out, I missed the rain.
I always wondered what happened with us.
I havent thought about that in years.
Shes drunk. -er than me. But I didnt really dump you, did I?
Hard.
Im guessing MacCallum, 18 years. Neat, with a water-back.
Is there any other way to take it?
I am now, sir.
At least somebodys using the damn thing. I was gonna fix her up but we took one trip and the kids fought so much, we never launched her again.
What is it you do again?
What would you say if I told you I was a member of an elite task force employed to safeguard our nations most precious resource: your daughter.
What do you say to that?
I say that feeling compelled to do the opposite of your parents is as enslaving as emulating them.
Best thing about being a dad is when your kid starts kicking your ass--
--and The ass of The man who adores her.
Hey, Sigmund, you think you could rustle up the bride and tell her to join the party?
Will do.
I just wanta wash my hand. It's got blood where I hurt it.
You don't live around here, do you?
You don't live around here, do you?
No, mam... I come from way back there. Me and my dog was tryin' to find my daddy and we got lost.

Thank you, Miss Johnson.

I don't live far from here. You and your dog can come home with me and have yourself a hot meal and then we'll talk about how to get you back home.
You got a pretty house, Miss Johnson!
I try...
And you say all them people is dead now?
That's right--
They lived a long time ago -- before you and I were born.
Where is Africa, Miss Johnson?
Here it is, right here.
That's where we come from first?
That's where we come from first?
That's where we came from first.
And the other people you told me 'bout, they is all colored folk?

Don't you teach in your school 'bout folk who ain't dead?

What he talk 'bout?

Why don't you sit and I'll read you something he said.
You're a friendly lady, Miss Johnson.
And you're a tired little boy. I'll make up the cot and you must get some sleep.
What about Sounder?
He'll get his place too -- now off with your clothes and into bed.
Now don't you think it's time you told me all about yourself?
I have a mother and her name is Rebecca -- My father's name is Nathan Lee Morgan, and...
Well, how did you like the class, David?
It was the best thing I ever been to, Miss Johnson!
... So me and Sounder, ran right by the men that was the prisoners, and crawled under the fence! That's when I cut my hand on the glass. It hurt like mad! But I kept runnin', and then I didn't feel no more hurtin' till I stopped runnin'! Why was that, Miss Johnson?
Because all you could think of was getting away from the guard.

Oh... . You right, that's all that was worryin' me right then...

Not now, David, it's time for bed. You have a long trip ahead of you in the morning...
What are you looking at, out there? There's nothing to see.
My daddy likes to look into the dark, even when there ain't nothin to see -- it's what you hear he say.
You think about your father a lot, don't you?
Yes mam...
Yes mam...
Well, you shouldn't worry about him too much, David.
Well, you shouldn't worry about him too much, David.
What do I tell my mama when I get home? I didn't find him and that's what I wanted to do.

But where is my daddy!?
But where is my daddy!?
I can't answer that for you -- but it's no fault of your own that you don't know where your father is now. You tell me what you did that kept you from finding your father. Come on, tell me...
I can't answer that for you -- but it's no fault of your own that you don't know where your father is now. You tell me what you did that kept you from finding your father. Come on, tell me...

What do that mean?

Means you keep me using my head, and that's good!
You know that the class is going to challenge your story, don't you, Clarence?
Yes, Miss Johnson...
Yes, Miss Johnson...
Go on...
Go on...
Me and my little sister, went down to the water hole, last Saturday--
How was your sister after you pulled her out of the water?
She was dirty and wet...
Clarence, would you tell us a story that was not true, after telling us it was?
No, Miss Johnson...
No, Miss Johnson...
Can you swim?

I can't do it, Rita -- that's the policy here on colored prisoners, and I ain't about to change it, not even for a friend like you.
Charlie, just because a man and his family are colored, you--
Charlie, just because a man and his family are colored, you--
Now look, Rita, I don't make the rules -- you puttin' yourself on a limb, comin' here, askin' me to do a thing like this. And I be damn if I'm going to jeopardize my job because you are in love with a little colored boy!
But, Charlie --
NO! N-O, NO!
I see you found what you was lookin' for.
I did look, Charlie, but I--
I did look, Charlie, but I--
No buts, Rita!
No buts, Rita!
Charlie, you have no legal right not to let this boy know where his father is! You hear that, you and this whole damn court house; what you are doing is wrong!

Don't tell me about what's wrong. You come into my office as a friend and steal city files! I could have you arrested for that -- and if you give out that information to anybody, that's exactly what I'm going to do -- and I'll tell everybody in this town how you got the information and who you got it for!

You would do that, wouldn't you?
You would do that, wouldn't you?
You getting the point, Mrs. Boatwright.
There ain't no possums in this woods tonight, Daddy.
Looks that way, son. Guess the cold done drove most of 'em down to the big water country -- but if there's one left out here -- we gotta find him.

If anybody's to blame, it's me -- I oughta nailed him when I took that shot.
It was too dark, Daddy.
It was too dark, Daddy.
Yeah. We better git back to house now.
Yes, sir...
You oughta be tired, too, Sounder. That possum shore whipped the hell outta you tonight!
He beat you, too, Daddy, and you had a big ol' shootin' rifle.
Boy, you don't make funny with your daddy like that.
David Lee...
Yes, sir...
Yes, sir...
You had a rough time out there tonight -- so you stay home from that school tomorrow.

You learnin' anything at that school?

Yes, sir -- I learn to write a little bit, and I can read a lot--
Readin' must be somethin' powerful, huh, son?
Yes, sir...
When the fall comes in these parts, the Night moon runs away like a rabbit -- you could stay out here lookin' all night, and not see a thing out yonder.
We goin' huntin' again tomorrow ?

Yep. I guess you must wonder why though, what with the luck we havin', but like I always say--

Now who says I didn't lay my mark on you, boy!
Well, looka here...
Hi, Daddy...
Hi, Daddy...
Hi to you, son...
Mama is outside with Josie Mae and Earl.
They is!? It shore is good to see you, boy!
We didn't find Sounder yet.
He'll show up one day.
He'll show up one day.
Do you think he's dead, Daddy?
Do you think he's dead, Daddy?
Naww -- he'll come back to you, soon as his wounds heal. This cake shore is tasty, son.
It's a shame they won't let 'em come in here. If I had the strength I'd knock down these damn walls -- if I could just git my arms 'round your mama right now -- is they on this side of us, son?
I think so...
Can you say what camp they gon' send you to, Daddy?
I don't know, son -- they won't tell us things like that -- but I don't want y'all to come here no more.
I don't know, son -- they won't tell us things like that -- but I don't want y'all to come here no more.
Why, Daddy; you won't be here?
Why, Daddy; you won't be here?
Just do like I tell you -- I'll get word to you through the visitin' preacher.
What's wrong with your leg, Daddy?
Got it hurt in a dynamite blast, son. The dirty dogs had no more use for me, so they let me have time off my sentence, and let me come home.
Son, that was some trip you went on...
Where was you, Daddy?
Where was you, Daddy?
That musta been afta they sent me to this place call Clayburn. That was the hardest workin' camp they sent me to. The work was so hard, you had to look for somethin' to laugh about to keep from feelin' the whole pain in your body. Like one time, it was in the middle of the day, and there weren't no sun -- you

Into the clouds and behind the mountains.
Into the clouds and behind the mountains.
What happened afta that?
What happened afta that?
The rains started to come, and the prisoners were scared to run 'cause they had to wait for guards to round us up, and tell us when to move -- but we didn't mind the rain comin' 'cause it meant we would git a little rest -- we just stood there, watchin' the guards and they weapons get wet, and that made us all
And me too, son! You shore done got to be such a big little man!
We goin' huntin' again, Daddy !?
We goin' huntin' again, Daddy !?
You bet we is!
You bet we is!
I cleaned and oiled all your stuff while you was gone...
Goodnight, Daddy...
Goodnight to you, son...

Where's everybody?
They gone to the field...
They gone to the field...
Guess I can't just lay here, then.
You feel alright today, Daddy?
Great, son -- not like wakin' up in jail. For a minute or two, didn't quite know where I was, but when I saw your face lookin down on me, made me know right away the day was gonna be a good one, and it all belonged to me!
Daddy, when is we goin' huntin'?
Soon -- but it won't be too much huntin' you'll be doin','cordin' to a good little story your mama told me last night -- you'll be goin' away from here, won't you?
I'm real proud of how you helped your mama to keep this place goin', David Lee.
Thank you, Daddy...
Wheeew! This is some hard work, but it beats goin' to jail.
You won't be goin' to jail again, will you, Daddy?
You won't be goin' to jail again, will you, Daddy?
No, son -- they'd have to kill me before I'd let 'em do that to me again!
You hurt, Daddy!?
No, no, I'm all right, son... This damn leg just won't act right no more!
From Miss Johnson --
Well, ain't you gon' open and read it for us?
Dear David, if you are coming to school here, be sure to bring some warm clothes. The school term will begin September 8th, but it would be good for you to be here by the 4th or 5th of the month. I do hope everything is fine and you will be here. Give my "hello" to your family. Yours truly, Miss Camille Johnson...
September 4 -- how far away is that?
You just came back home, Daddy. I don't wanna leave right now -- I wanna stay home and be with you.
And I wanta be with you, too, but this school is somethin' that's good for you -- somethin you need, like good air to breathe, and I want you to have it, boy, and that's the way it's gonna be!

Will you help me to find out what camp they sent my father to?
See you tomorrow, Miss Boatwright.

He eats all right -- his throat ain't scarred.
Then why don't he holler like he usta?

I guess I'll havta work harder to git him back like he usta be.
Why don't you try and git you a new dog?
Naw, I'm carryin' it!
Thank you, Josie Mae.
David Lee, it's time for you to get to bed!
Goodnight.
Mama, there's hot meat on the stove!
That's right!
That's right!
Where did it come from, Mama?
Where did it come from, Mama?
Where all meat come from -- now git yourself washed up and be snappy about it -- you got six miles ahead of you to that school.
Ready to go, Mama!
Tuck that shirt in, David Lee.
You got two shirts on?
Yes mam...
Yes mam...
When you get outta that school, you come right on back home, y'all gon' have to take this laundry work I done for Miss Boatwright today.
Who's winning, Mama?
Nobody yet -- it's all tied up.
What do they do in the white churches, Mama?
Same as we -- they pray.
Who is they?
Children, come here...
Don't take my Daddy! Please don't take my Daddy!
David, come back here!
'Bye, Mama...
'Bye, son -- I won't be gone long.
Did you see Daddy?
No, son. We havta wait 'til the holiday comes -- anyway, they won't let womenfolk see their men no time.
No, son. We havta wait 'til the holiday comes -- anyway, they won't let womenfolk see their men no time.
Can I go when the holiday comes?
Can I go when the holiday comes?
You sure can, son...
Any sign of Sounder?
No mam -- I looked all over.
No mam -- I looked all over.
I think maybe he was scraped on the head by that shot. I don't think he's dead -- just gone somewhere to heal himself.
What is it, David Lee?
Listen, Mama...
Poor creature...
He'll be all right, Mama. I'll make him all right.
Mama! Mama! Miss Boatwright, say she gon' help me find where Daddy is!
Good! But you don't have to tell the whole valley 'bout it! You'll get that woman in trouble!
Can't sleep?
No, ma'am... Mama, I wanted Mrs. Boatwright to find out where Daddy is, so me and Sounder can go see him.
No, ma'am... Mama, I wanted Mrs. Boatwright to find out where Daddy is, so me and Sounder can go see him.
So did I. I figured when the time got right, we could all take a day or two and walk up there, but it's not the kind of long trip for a child to take alone.

I can do it, Mama -- you know that. In the Bible stories you read to us, everybody's always goin' on a long journey. Jacob goes into a strange land where his uncle is and he don't even know where he lives, but he finds him. Everybody finds what they supposed to find.

But you'll be away from home for days -- what will you do when the dark comes, where will you sleep? I can't send you away from here like that!

Mama, don't I always do what you say -- every time I go to the fields to plant the corn, to Miss Boatwright's and the woods -- you tell me what to do and I do it, and you don't worry.

No, I don't and I oughtn't not to after the way you've taken over since they took him away -- and I would like for you to see 'im so you can come back and tell me about 'im. The field's all planted, so I guess I can spare you for a little while. When do you wanta leave?
Can I go day after tomorrow?
Yes, son. You better get back to bed.
Yes, son. You better get back to bed.
Good night, Mama...
Good night, Mama...
Good night...
I wish you wouldn't take the dog with you, David -- he's likely to be a burden to you.
I got to, Mama. I know Daddy wants to see him.
Here's your food -- now you go straight to that place -- if you need to rest, go into a church or railroad station -- but don't go into nobody's house, you hear me?
Yes, mam...
Yes, mam...
Ask your daddy to give you some word about when he'll be comin' home -- and tell 'im we love him.
I cut it on some glass and we got lost, Mama.
Did you find your father?
Did you find your father?
Didn't see 'im, Mama. The other men there say they didn't know Daddy.
Didn't see 'im, Mama. The other men there say they didn't know Daddy.

It's when the heat is so bad, dogs go crazy.

He won't go mad -- he's just lookin' for a cooler spot.

Be good and be smart, little boy.
Yes, ma'm...

Thank you, Miss Boatwright!

Don't pout now, David, it's a long trip.
Don't pout now, David, it's a long trip.
I'm used to it.
Hello, David...
Hi, Mrs. Boatwright... I'm sorry 'bout the way I acted the other day, Miss Boatwright.
If they heard me sing like this up North I'd be richer than the man I sharecrop for.
And if they saw me pitch the way I did today -- they'd hire me just to strike out Babe Ruth!
You know, one time by mistake I went into a white church down in Row County and to this day I don't know how'n the devil I got outta that church alive.
They probly thought you was crazy.

I guess so -- but I went home and did me some praying to the Lord. I said, Lord, I went into this white church down in Row and all I want you to tell me is how I ever got outta there in one piece.

Somebody told me Nathan was back. How is he?
Somebody told me Nathan was back. How is he?
Why don't you pay him a visit, Mr. Howard? He'll tell you all about it.
Night, son!
And don't wake up Josie Mae and Earl!
I bet you could use a hot cup of coffee, Nathan Lee.
I shore could, Miss Rebecca.
The boy done went into my walnuts! I skin my fingers to the bone to pick two pounds that's worth almost nothing at the commissary and he done took almost half of what I pick!
The boy is hungry, Rebecca.
We been through these off-seasons before -- we made it.
What we make it to? The next season to work ourselves to death, share croppin' for ol' man Howard, so he can get richer and we can't even eat when the croppin' time is done?
Good mornin', Nathan.
Mornin'...

You ready to eat?

I'll wait till after the children.
How's the weather out there?
Little chilly.
Little chilly.
Hope it don't freeze out our baseball game today!
If there ever was a devil in this county, Ike, you is it!
Ike, you could make a song outta that!
The most important thing is that you're home! We was gonna have cold eatin' tonight, 'cause of the heat, but now, I'm goin' to cook!
Well, let's get to it, Miss Rebecca,'cause I been waitin' too long a time for your good cookin'!
What did he want?

No, I ain't got no word yet, Rebecca. I went to the courthouse yesterday to see 'bout it, but they just won't tell me nothin' about what labor camp Nathan was sent to. I'm sorry, Rebecca.
It's a shame, Reverend. It's a damn shame.
It's a shame, Reverend. It's a damn shame.
I hope you don't take to bitterness, Sister Morgan. I tell you like I tell all the women in this church who got the same trouble you got. No matter what the trial or what the misery is, I tell 'em to stay with God.

Holy shit Cartman! What was that?!
How the fuck should I know!!
Dude, this is seriously lame. I didn't know we were gonna get all dirty and stuff.

Cartman, over zere, is the electrical box. You must sneak over zere and shut it off before I return with Terrance and Phillip or the alarms will sound and I will be shot full of holes. Got it?

Thank you, Kenny.
Yeah, thanks for going back to hell for us. You're a real pal.
Whew, I'm sure glad that's over.
Yeah, but you know, I learned something today. I learned that getting all worked up over fuck and shit and cockmaster is just stupid... You all focused so hard on erasing profanity that you forgot the most important thing... To love each other.
Mom, I'm a man. Just a man. And I'm going to have fun with profanity just like you and dad did when you were little.
Yeah, so what if you say uncle raper or dicksucker or, or-
Oh dear God...
What is 'fisting'?
I knew this would happen! Those bastard Canadians have now killed a child! Can't people see the damage that film is doing?!
He was killed doing something he saw in the movie. It was Terrance and Phillip... THEY killed Kenny.
Sheila, you're going to far! Those are YOUR children!
YES! AND I WILL NOT ALLOW MY CHILDREN TO BE RUINED BY SMUT!! I am sorry young man, but I have had it up to here! STRAP THEM IN!
Oh Lord, what have we done...?
Wake up, people! We all have to do things that aren't pretty sometimes! It's the not pretty things that make life worth fighting the not pretty things for! Why do you think children have to be born in hospitals?
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?! We need to stop the not pretty things from letting our children be born in hospitals!
We're going to find our boys! For God's sake Sheila, you almost had them killed!!
Shiteater-
-Or monkey fucker-
My fellow Americans. I have led this fight in the War against profanity. I have founded Mothers Against Canada. Our neighbor to the north has abused us for the last time.

Terrance and Phillip MOVIE?! Oy gevalt! Not again!
What is Terrance and Phillip?
What is Terrance and Phillip?
Terrance and Phillip are two VERY untalented, unfunny actors from Canada. Their TV show is filled with toilet humor and bad language and is just complete garbage. Now it appears they have a movie and I'm positive it's not suitable for children!

Well, it looks like I'll have to send a warning letter out to parents. I have to put a stop to this before MORE children see 'Terrance and Phillip'.
We must take action on this immediately.
Ooh yes. I think we'll have to give detention to those boys.
Ooh yes. I think we'll have to give detention to those boys.
Forgive me for saying so, Principal Victoria, but your methods are too... Shall we say... soft? As head of the PTA, I am exercising my right under article 42 of the PTA code.

Yes Principal Victoria. The PTA is impeaching you.

This is NOT a place for fun and games! This is rehabilitation! Now GET TO IT!! We at MAC have a trial to go to!
How is the children's progress?
Very encouraging. Most of the children have been weened from their naughty mouths.

Then we'll have to resort to plan B and call the v-chip organization.
Mrs. Brovlofski, the V-chip hasn't been fully tested yet, it could be dangerous.
I don't care if it's dangerous! Desperate times call for desperate measures, Mr. Mackey. Perhaps I need to remind you of your situation.
I don't care if it's dangerous! Desperate times call for desperate measures, Mr. Mackey. Perhaps I need to remind you of your situation.

Well, Terrance I hope you learned something from this whole experience.
I did, Terrance, I learned that you are a boner biting dick fart fuck face!
Say Phillip, want to see the Northern Lights?
You bet, Terrance!
HA HA HA! You burned yourself to death by lighting the fart! HA HA HA!!
I sure did, Phillip!!
Hello, Conan!
Hello, Brooke Shields!
Good one, Phillip! Cheers.
Cheers, Terrance!

Don't believe the hype!!
The problem is you don't allow your children to think for themselves. You try to raise them in a protective bubble, and then when they finally get old enough, they realize they've been lied to, and they resent you for it.
Yeah, God, no wonder your country is so fucked up.
Oh, you are such a maroon!
You would know, dummy.
Oh, Phillip. This cannot be good.
I know, Terrance. This is quite the shitstorm we've found ourselves in this time.
Phillip, this is worse than that trip to Quebec City when I fell asleep in that disco.
I know, Terrance. I know.
What's going on Terrance?
Canada is saving us!!
Did you hear that, Terrance? I farted!
You did? Just now?
AGH!
Terrance! NO!
You're quite a purveyor of filth, little boy!
Indeedy, that was a delicious choice of words!
Oh, a new recruit, huh? Welcome to hell, kid! Relax! Take a load off!!
You remember... Saddam Hussein, don't you?!
Saddam, would you let me do my job please!
Hey relax, guy. Let's see what the kid wants.
Well of COURSE he wants out of hell! The whole POINT of hell is that you don't WANT to be here!
Okay, kid, I have a deal for you! If you want out of hell, all you have to do is collect 10 proofs of purchases from 'Snacky Smores.' They're rich, chocolatey and really hit the spot. Bring me ten proofs of purchases and we'll grant you ANY WISH YOU WANT.
I don't see why you have to belittle me in front of people like that.
Hey, relax guy. It's just a cruel joke. Rich, chocolatey Snacky Smores are only available up on Earth. He'll never get 'em, see?

Well a little business too. In my upcoming project Star Trackers I play a ship's captain, and I really wanted to get a feel for the outer space experience. I feel it will add more credibility to my performance.

No, I think hygiene is important. It helps you get into the part.
Very professional of you.
Where the hell did you come from?
Hello second mate Barnes. I was instructed to come to the bridge.
Weren't you down in the dining room?
I was there. Officer Taylor accessed my CPU directly to open the airlock doors. They are not functioning properly.
I was there. Officer Taylor accessed my CPU directly to open the airlock doors. They are not functioning properly.
Oh he did, did he?
Yes he did. Yes he did. Barnes looks at the monitor - Taylor and the others are still in the dining room -
You didn't do anything to the monitors, did you Mac?
You didn't do anything to the monitors, did you Mac?
I did nothing to the monitors.
And what are they doing now, Mac?
They are awaiting further information.
Were you going to give it to them?
I am here to provide service to... to all our guests. There is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction. It is my duty...to report this.
I am here to provide service to... to all our guests. There is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction. It is my duty...to report this.
Well you did the right thing Mac.
On channel 10?
The device has stopped responding.
Mac, you really earned your wings this flight.
My...wings...
I am here to provide service to... to all our guests. There is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction. It is my duty...to report this.
I hear you Mac and I appreciate it. Frankly I don't know what I'd have done without you on this one.

There is a high level...of passenger dissatisfaction.
And I intend to correct that at once. I'll tell you something Mac...
Why should she, it's her fault. All guests are told not to eat in zero gravity, but she just wanted to have fun I guess, didn't realize what a grain of salt can do to sophisticated machinery.
Well, I guess she figures she's paying for it.
Well, I guess she figures she's paying for it.
Ain't it the truth. Must be good to be rich.
What did you say to me?
It's a little late for you to be up.
It's a little late for you to be up.
Look answer my question!
All too well, captain.
Well shut it off at once!
Well I guess there's no time like the present. I'll go run a check on that room, just to show we go that extra mile for our guests.
Sounds like you've been talking to Mac too much.
No, I just ran it! Why are you running it again?
Well it's a good thing that I did.
It's telling me fail mode confirmed. Did you see this?
There must be some mistake. You sure you hit the right commands?
There must be some mistake. You sure you hit the right commands?
Yes I'm sure I hit the right commands.
Yes I'm sure I hit the right commands.
Why don't you reset and run it again. The pods check out ok.
You're certain of that?
Trust me. Even checked 'em with my own eyes.
Trust me. Even checked 'em with my own eyes.
All right, I'll give it a shot.
Well, everything's running smoother than a baby's ass.
Ain't it the truth. The two say nothing for a beat -

I don't know. Everything's up in the air at this point, no pun intended.

That's very pragmatic of you, Barnes.
That's very pragmatic of you, Barnes.
Thank you.
Man, I'm hungry. I'm going to call the steward, you want anything?.
Nah, I already ate. Why don't you just go down there?
What, and leave you here all by your lonesome?
Uh...
I think I can handle it.
Well, maybe I will. You sure you don't want anything?
Well, maybe I will. You sure you don't want anything?
No. I'm all set. Thanks.
No. I'm all set. Thanks.
Well, maybe I'll surprise you.
Well, maybe I'll surprise you.
I can hardly wait.
Bridge! Can anyone hear me?!
Yeah yeah yeah, give me a minute here.
If anyone can hear me please respond!
That's very professional sounding of you, Taylor.
Barnes, can you hear me, are you all right?
Why yes Ryan, I am, and thanks for asking. You don't have to talk to the intercom, I can hear you fine.
Why yes Ryan, I am, and thanks for asking. You don't have to talk to the intercom, I can hear you fine.
What is the condition of the bridge?
The bridge is fine, Taylor, how are things down there?
Transmit the code 3 emergency and take us offline. Override the airlock sensors and hurry! We're running out of time, we have to get to the pods!

What are you talking about! Can you transmit the code 3 -
What are you talking about! Can you transmit the code 3 -
Yes I can transmit the code 3 emergency! I just don't think it's a prudent move at this juncture.
Now do you want the good news first or the bad news?
You better start making sense!
You better start making sense!
Ok, I will. The bad news is the ship is history. Life support will last another 36 hours, maybe.
Ok, I will. The bad news is the ship is history. Life support will last another 36 hours, maybe.
Then we've got to get to the lifepods!
Then we've got to get to the lifepods!
I'd advise you to shut up and let me finish Taylor. You needn't worry about the lifepods because they're all gone, jettisoned. Save for one.
It's still not going to work! They'll detect you upon re-entry in an emergency vessel!
Who said I'll re-enter in the pod? I got friends out in space, Ryan, friends willing to get me back unnoticed. Thank God for deregulation huh?
Uh, that's an affirmative, Roger Wilco. Please proceed.
We have the codes here. How do you want to receive them?
We have the codes here. How do you want to receive them?
Well, preferably in tens and twenties...
That was a joke Taylor, lighten up! Why don't you just hold them up to the lens. I'll write them down, and once I'm through verifying them, I'll get back to you.
Will you transmit the distress signal?
Mac, can you hear me? Come in?
Taylor, you surprise me.
I don't know what you're talking about!
Sure you do. Sending Mac out on a little recon work. How pathetic. Problem is it seems Mac blew a few fuses. Or maybe he's just a little drunk. Were you partying with a robot Taylor?
Look we gave you what you asked for. It checks out didn't it?! What more do you want from us!
I told you not to try anything smart! I guess you're too much of a maverick to follow a simple order! And that's just too bad for all of you now, isn't it?
I told you not to try anything smart! I guess you're too much of a maverick to follow a simple order! And that's just too bad for all of you now, isn't it?

Idiot...
Good help is hard to find...
Barnes?
That's me.
That's me.
Break it down to me, what's going on?

Seems like they're cooperating. Hopefully I'll be out of here and on my way very soon.

I don't know. I really haven't made up my mind yet. We'll see how nicely they behave.

Oh you'll get it, believe me. So I'll see you in a few.
Oh you'll get it, believe me. So I'll see you in a few.
10-4 good buddy.
It's time we lock coordinates.
I know, I know.
So, what are we waiting for?

Cool your jets...I'm doing a little damage control.
Damage control! What kind of damage? What's going on Barnes!
You're not helping my heart condition any, Barnes! Now just what the hell are you dragging your ass for?
The others decided to get cute with me, so I'm teaching them a lesson!
This ship is going down in a blaze of glory!
Well blaze your ass out of there! You've completely altered your trajectory, are we linking up or not?!
Well blaze your ass out of there! You've completely altered your trajectory, are we linking up or not?!
Don't worry about me, I'm changing coordinates now. I've come to far to be tripped up by some Dudley do-right... motherfuckers!
Well if you knew it then why did set your thrusters on before making the calculation?
I told you, I had to teach a few people a lesson!
I told you, I had to teach a few people a lesson!

Let's get something straight, Chappy!
Now I got enough air and supplies to make another complete orbit in the pod! You're just gonna have to pick me up later.
This is a major screw up on your part, goddamn it!
Is that clear?
That's clear.
That's clear.
Good. Now you'll hear from me when I have the new coordinates. In the meantime don't bug me.

Well...I don't mind. I can put up with it. I'm taking six months off after this, and I won't have to deal with people snapping their fingers at me.
Not me. I'm in for the long haul. In nine months I'll have enough to take a few years off.
Well, more power to you. Me, I start to bug out after too much time out here.
I don't have a problem with it. Besides, you get to meet a lot of interesting people.
What's the use...we're gonna die...
Don't say that! It ain't over till it's over!
We're going to die.
Will you shut up already?
It's getting hard to breathe...
Just don't move around too much.

Yes. Theoretical discoveries aside, there's nothing like the real thing. How about you?
Yes. Theoretical discoveries aside, there's nothing like the real thing. How about you?
This is my second commercial flight. I used to run satellite freighters but that got old fast.
So you were looking for a new challenge.
Well, plus the money ain't that bad. DAWN So, tell me, do you think everyone gets their million dollars' worth on this trip of a lifetime?
Well, let me put it this way. Most of the cost is due to safety reasons. Most people are not familiar with space travel, so we have to take extra precautions in the event they do something careless.
Like open an airlock by mistake?
Like open an airlock by mistake?
Well I don't think there's a chance of that happening. It's usually the moon walks. Sometimes you feel like a kindergarten teacher.

Still, I hope I behave on the moon. I'll stick close to you.
What are we going to do?
I don't know.
We don't.
Well maybe there's a way out of here.
Well maybe there's a way out of here.
Fat chance of that. Even if we had C4 and a laser torch these doors wouldn't budge. That son of a bitch...that stupid son of a bitch.
Given a malfunction, how would a rescue team get you out if the doors won't open?
Probably come through the wall I suppose.
Probably come through the wall I suppose.
Well maybe we can do something like that.
I don't think you know what you're talking about. Besides, what could we use for tools? A steak knife? A corkscrew?
Just considering our options... sir.
Supposing we could get out of this room? Is there anything we could do to reach the bridge?
It depends on the condition of the ship. If I could get to one of the suit compartments I could check the exterior air locks for a possible entry.

Can't we access the mainframe to check the ship's condition?
With what? How am I going to interface with it? I need to be able to talk to the system and to have the system talk to me.
OK...it's open.
Seen one like it before?
Seen one like it before?
Sure. It complies with all standard construction codes.
Sure. It complies with all standard construction codes.
Great.
Damn it. If only we could get to those suits... Dawn then thinks of something -
Why can't we?
Why can't we?
I don't know the condition of the compartments. Depending on damage, debris...could be a fatal mistake.
And suppose you couldn't hold out?
Suppose you didn't have to hold your breath?
We could send Mac. If he can retrieve one suit, we could go back for the other.
You're right.
He certainly is polite.
Close every door behind you!
It must be oxygenated if we can hear him.
Yeah, let's hope he can find a way through.
If I could get to the bridge I could send the distress signal.
Even if we do, it might be too late.
Everyone just stay put.
Wait.
I can't let you do that.
Look I know what I'm doing. I have experience and training in space walking.
Look I know what I'm doing. I have experience and training in space walking.

So we did.
You're ready for the real thing?
At this point I'm ready for anything.
Be careful, you don't want to puncture the suit.
Don't worry about me. Where are we going?
Explosive?
One of Barnes' duds, luckily for us. Take this out of the equation right now...
Taylor?
Yeah?
Yeah?
What do you think's going to happen to us?
Well, Dawn, I'm an optimist by nature.
Yeah, but you didn't answer my question.
Do you want some advice?
Sure.
Sure.
Don't worry about what will happen, just concentrate on what is happening. You'll live longer.
Don't worry about what will happen, just concentrate on what is happening. You'll live longer.
Words to live by.
Dawn! Dawn!
Helllp!
I guess I owe you a debt of gratitude. You saved my life.
It was no time to lose my partner. We're going to have to hurry, he's on to us.
Oh my God. What happened?
The room is filled with poison gas. The hydraulic system must have blown.
What's that?
A schematic of the ship. Looking for a lifeline to the pods.

We don't have enough suits to get the others out.
We don't have enough suits to get the others out.
That's why we need a safe passage. remember what you said earlier, about getting through the wall? That might just be our ticket.
Take this flare.
A flare? A flare won't do it.
A flare? A flare won't do it.
No...
A little dab'll do ya. Now you know how to get there, right?
Why? Where are you going?
I'm not going with you.
What? What are you talking about?
What? What are you talking about?
There's only room on that pod for seven. That's you and the others. I'm counting on you to get them out of there.
And what are you going to do?!
I'm going to try and buy you some time. I can get to the bridge from here.
I'm going to try and buy you some time. I can get to the bridge from here.
But how are you going to escape?
But how are you going to escape?
Don't worry about me. There's still a chance I can issue a distress signal.
Don't worry about me. There's still a chance I can issue a distress signal.
But you can't be sure! It's suicide. You have to come with us!
But you can't be sure! It's suicide. You have to come with us!
I can't!
I will once I get past the bulkhead. Good luck.
You too.
Dawn. Come in.
Taylor! Where are you?
I'm in the bridge.
Barnes?
He's out of the equation. Talk to me.
I'm about to blow the wall.
I'm about to blow the wall.
Hurry. You have to get them out of there!
Hurry. You have to get them out of there!
How does the distress signal look?
Uh, it's ok, everything's going to be ok...now I'm counting on you, and whatever you do keep calm, we don't want them to panic.
I'll do my best.
I'll do my best.
So what's going to happen to you?
So what's going to happen to you?
I'm staying with the ship. I'll be all right. Now hurry.
I'm staying with the ship. I'll be all right. Now hurry.
Thanks for everything, Taylor. Will I see you again?
Thanks for everything, Taylor. Will I see you again?
Hopefully sooner than later.
Hopefully sooner than later.
Sooner than later.
Sooner than later.
Over and out.
What the hell are you doing?
We have room! Let's go!
We have room! Let's go!
What do you mean? What happened!
What do you mean? What happened!
We don't have time. I'll explain later, hurry!
So close...
And so far.
I never thought this would happen. No premonitions, nothing.
It did. It is. There's nothing we can do about that.
It did. It is. There's nothing we can do about that.
Except write our wills.
Will you marry me?
Marry you?
Marry you?
That's right. Will you marry me?
I would, but no one can perform the ceremony. I guess it doesn't matter.
It would matter to us.
In that case, I accept.
Good. In that case, I pronounce us man and wife.
Right now it's about 8 o'clock at home. People are going to work, kids are going to school...
Try not to think about it.
What is it?!
I don't know. Wave to them!
I'm fine.
Congratulations on your...recent award.
Congratulations on your...recent award.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Is there anything I can help you with?

No, just enjoying the view.

Well, there's no better to way to see the world, than with us.
Well, there's no better to way to see the world, than with us.
So I've been told.
So I've been told.
Well if you need anything, please feel free to ask me. Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available 24 hours in the earthrise room, and a large selection of vintage wines here in our ship bar.
Yes Mac, but the guests are requesting it. It will reduce the level of negative feedback.
That is one of my priorities.
What is happening around here!!!
There's no time to explain. Get everyone together! We found a way to the pods!
There's no time to explain. Get everyone together! We found a way to the pods!
Where's Taylor?
Where's Taylor?
He's up on the bridge! He's going to be OK. Now who's missing?
Carlo!
He's in the bathroom.
I'm going back for Taylor!
Are you nuts! It's too risky!
I'm homesick.
Homesick? It's only been two days!
Homesick? It's only been two days!
We should have gone to Nassau. At least we could go swimming, lie on the beach.

How is it going to be different from this? Go see some boring footprint under glass?
How is it going to be different from this? Go see some boring footprint under glass?
Look you were the one who wanted to do something different, something to tell all your friends. Any chump can go to Nassau.
Look around you baby, we're rubbing elbows with royalty, oil sheiks, this is class. You'll be envied by everyone.
I guess so.
I guess so.
Besides I can't wait to tee off on the sea of tranquillity. That should shore up that prick Hank Drexler.
Oh no...I think there's carrots in here...
Send it back if you don't want it.
Well now what are we gonna do!
How am I supposed to know?
How am I supposed to know?
You're Delbert Miles! You have more clout than some whacked out pilot! Talk to him!
You're Delbert Miles! You have more clout than some whacked out pilot! Talk to him!
Talk to him...Jesus...
It's getting too cold in here. I can't stand this anymore!
Baby, take it easy.
Baby, take it easy.
How can you sit there with your fat stomach and tell me to take it easy! I want to go home! I want to be warm! I want to get out of here!
Look. We're talking about life and death here. I don't know why we're even having this conversation.
Well what would you know about it? You don't have anything to lose.
You're gonna give him those bank codes, you know why? Because I'm telling you to, that's why. I'm not losing my life over some greedy pig.
Who are you calling a pig, rummy?
I haven't quite made up my mind yet.
I'll tell you what you're gonna do. You're gonna stay put like Taylor said.
Again with the orders from you! You got a Napoleon complex chief, and I'm getting sick of it!
What are you going to do about it?
I tell you, something's not right here. How do we know they're not going to use the pod for themselves?
Because, Taylor wouldn't do that, that's why.
Because, Taylor wouldn't do that, that's why.
What makes you so sure?
What the hell is that?
The engines!
Officer Taylor, how are you this evening?
Mac. What's shaking?
Mac, I have a favor to ask you. Mac looks at Taylor -
Certainly. If you need anything, please feel free to ask me. Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available --

Yes I know all that. Mac, I need you to help us out with a little technical problem.
Yes I know all that. Mac, I need you to help us out with a little technical problem.
Certainly. I have a full working knowledge of the ships operations.
Certainly. I have a full working knowledge of the ships operations.
Right, I understand that...
I need you to actually do something for me. I need to access your CPU, directly.
That will not be necessary. You can simply speak to me. I understand most languages fluently.

Yeah but the ship's mainframe doesn't. I need you to tell it something.

Alteration of my central processing unit should be done only by an authorized service dealer.
Alteration of my central processing unit should be done only by an authorized service dealer.
I know but we're in a bind.
Now Mac, can you tell me the status of this deck?
One moment please... one moment please...
But the corridor outside this door is open, correct?
Yes. You can enjoy some wonderful views from there.
Mac, what about the suit compartments on this level? Can they be accessed?
I'm sorry. The suit compartments are in a non-oxygenated, zero gravity atmosphere. I'm afraid that's off limits to all passengers.
Ok Mac... I'll talk to you on this. I want to find a way to get to the bridge, then I want you to come back.
Certainly. Anything I can do to be of service.
How is it looking, Mac?
I would recommend a maintenance crew in this sector.
Is it safe for human transport?
That's affirmative.
I'm an addict. I can't go through a day without the stuff. Theo reaches over and pours for him with a steady hand.
You're not from around here, are you?
You're not from around here, are you?
I'm from Akron.
I'm looking for a man.
What kind of man?
What kind of man?
A bowler.
99 years, 241 days, 15 hours, and 20 minutes of no bowling. Alfie shuffles up to the self-serve island and begins wiping it down.
Find your bowler?
Find your bowler?
Yeah, but it didn't go so good. He wasn't the man I thought he'd be. Theo is trying to affix the lid on his cup, but his hands are trembling, spilling some of the coffee.

My father used to say to me "Never..." no, hmmm. "Always..." No, no... Ah! Love and hate are blood relations.
My father used to say to me "Never..." no, hmmm. "Always..." No, no... Ah! Love and hate are blood relations.
Maybe I should have left the ball in the car.
Did you hear about that bowler who got smeared? I saw them pull a body bag out of the alley. I heard he was kacked but good. They had to take apart the pin machine to get him out.
The pin machine?
The pin machine?
Just like Junior did the last time; lane six. All's I know is it's gonna be a closed coffin. My advice to you is to lay low. He puts on a pair of dark 7-Eleven shades, flips up his collar and skulks away.
You a mini-golfer?
Nope.
Nope.
Paradise, huh? Might be one of the new putt-putts off route 99. Theo turns to leave.

No. I'm from Akron.
Where can I find Buzz Fazeli?
Whoa, cool your maples. Over the bridge, past the Peter Pan, last house on the dead end. Theo releases Sid's hand. Sid drops to his knees and cradles his damaged hand.

Haven't seen a ball like that since '69.
Haven't seen a ball like that since '69.
It belonged to my dad.
I don't know no Buzz Fazeli.
Look Sid, a Buzz Burger. The Faz's favorite lunch. Sid reaches for the plate. Buzz walks over to the booth and pulls his burger away from Sid.
Hey, cut it out Sid, that tickles. I'm serious! You guys are related, right?
He's my dad.
Heh, heh, heh.
You said it would be unethical to help me. You call dwarf bowling ethical!
Sorry about your loss.
I should've pegged you guys for bowling dicks from day one.
After we ID, we bury the body. Case and casket closed.
You tried to make it look like Junior trashed his place. Junior's underground in that coffin you dicks put him in.

It's splitsville for you.
Hey, ain't I seen you on the tour?
No, pinhead, he ain't here to bowl.
Fazeli...I don't know no Buzz Fazeli.
What do you want with old man Faz?
Yeah, basement bingo.
Lemme see your ball.
Ah, come on, lemme see your ball.
You afraid we're gonna steal it?
Three whips. To go.
When you get a chance.
Hey, you still here?
We're looking for Buzz Fazeli, seen him?
Buzz, Mr. Kastle wants to talk to you.
Are you guys bruddas?
Look, Faz, Mr. Kastle was not his usual charismatic self today when he told us to tell you... What was that he said...?
I remember, Sid! Mr. Kastle says he don't like no sticky fingers in the till.
I remember, Sid! Mr. Kastle says he don't like no sticky fingers in the till.
Pinhead! Don't just blurt it right out.
Your pop said to put these on his tab. Sid gets up and jerks his thumb towards the door.
So Buzz, let's skedaddle. Mr. Kastle is waiting. As Buzz gets up, Theo rises and steps between his father and the two sleazeballs.
Bowling used to be so pure, so...All- American. Breeze sings along with Caruso and pretends to conduct.
La da da dalala...
La da da dalala...
I hate fuckin' opera.

How could you hate opera, Sid? Opera has all the drama and excitement of real life - to music!

Right, eating at the core, eating it's way out. It makes me sick!
How do you turn this thing off?
Wait! That's an aria!
Hello Mr. Kastle. Junior, long time. I thought they locked you up and threw away the warden!
Is it true they blacked out the whole county giving you electro-shock? Junior looks from one man to the other, breathing heavily, his nostrils flaring.
Bowling police, step back, give him room.
Nothing going on here, everybody stand back. Let him through, ladies. Ladies, please. As they start to move through the female throng, a little girl pops out in front of them, holding her ball.
Did you know you were parked in the handicap space?
Kastle's daughter's been lookin' for you.
She told us you went after Junior to save your old man's hide. You got some balls goin' after that psycho.
Only problem is, you didn't put his lights out, you just got him mad. Then he took it out on poor Faz, God rest his soul. Theo patches out.

Think he bought it?
Think he bought it?
I'd buy it!
The Faz sure took care a her. Breeze makes a nasal GRUNT as he tries to suppress a snigger. Sid - trying to keep a straight face - elbows him. Sid and Breeze approach the coffin. Breeze pulls an orange whip out of a paper bag and carefully places it on the coffin lid.
Nectar of the bowling gods, Faz.
Nectar of the bowling gods, Faz.
See ya 'round Faz.
Yeah, and make it extra muddy, I didn't sleep a zee last night. Sheila fills a cup. Buzz lifts it to his mouth, his hands trembling.
You don't need coffee, Mr. Fazeli; you need a vacation. Sheila catches sight of Theo pulling into the parking lot. She puts a Ken head earring in her right ear. Buzz follows Sheila's gaze.

Some people will do anything for an autograph. Theo enters the diner and walks over to Buzz.
Buzz Burger, side of 'cues. You haven't introduced me to your fan.
Sheila, meet...uh... I forget the name.
You look like you're something on the lanes.
Theo's bowled on the tour.
Theo's bowled on the tour.
Oh, a professional man. What'll you have?
What's on your mind, Miles?
We've been partners a long time now, haven't we Buzz?
We've been partners a long time now, haven't we Buzz?
Seven years.
This scam we got going here was your
brainstorm, Buzz. I admit, I thought it was a rotten idea, but I put up the scratch. And now we got a beautiful thing.

It's a beautiful thing.
It's a beautiful thing.
A beautiful thing. And you know why Buzz? You know what we got? Buzz raises an eyebrow as he buttons his shirt.
And look at that; both partners go down together. Kastle shoves the sculpture onto the floor, stands up, and crushes it under his heel. He goes over and puts his arm around Buzz.
Simple math, Buzz. Two plus two does not equal three.

Well, Mr. Fazeli, the Bowling Congress says I'm a thorn in their side.
Well, Mr. Fazeli, the Bowling Congress says I'm a thorn in their side.
Don't worry about the Congress, they're just a bunch of moralistic busy-bodies.
I got suspended when I was young, too. I was pretty cocky in my day.
They suspended me for 100 years.

I can appeal in five. I was hoping you could help me Mr. Fazeli.

I've never had orange whips, I'm from Akron.
Remember the finals in Akron in '59? You had a seven-ten split in the final frame.
Yeah, against that prick VanDeMark.
Yeah, against that prick VanDeMark.
Ten thousand to one, but you pegged it. The toughest shot on the last frame.

That game was before you was born.

My mom was there. She told me about it. The 'Fazeli Split.'
Orange whip, nectar of the bowling gods. Thanks sweetie. Millie turns the tray so that Buzz takes the untainted whip. Theo takes the other glass.
Thanks.
Where'd you get this ball?
It's mine.
It's mine.
Who gave it to you?
Who gave it to you?
Grace Skinner.
Grace Skinner.
Grace Skinner. Who's Grace Skinner to you?
Grace Skinner. Who's Grace Skinner to you?
She's my mom.
Who are you? Who sent you here?
I'm your son. You're a hard father to find.
I don't know no Grace Skinner.
You knew her. You married her in 1963.
You're a bullshit artist, that's what you are. You got no right to be here! Theo yanks the trophy away from Buzz.
I got a right. You're my father.
I got a right. You're my father.
I ain't nobody's father!
Millie left to stay with her sister in Ronkonkoma.
You know what a mixer ball is? It's like you, you come out of nowhere and upset things, scattering everything all over. Buzz grumpily waves at him to sit.

I couldn't pay someone enough to try to kill me. Sheila comes over to take their orders.
Theo.
Theo! This is Sheila Kastle, my partner's daughter.
Watch out for that one. She's got a great average, but she's looking for a prince. And, believe me, she's
kissed a lotta tadpoles. Listen, I been thinking about your problem. I'm not the guy to sponsor you. It would be unethical. But, there is something I could do for you. Putt-putt golf.

Putt-putt golf?
It's the next level, the next dimension... ...the small ball.
The small ball.
The small ball.
It's gonna be bigger than big. Think Europe. Think Asia. They don't have room for real golf courses in Japan.

Not for me. Miniature golf's for pansies.

If the Japanese are pansies, then pansies are my kind of people. Sheila steps over to the booth with their food. The Buzz Burger has three holes cut in the middle to make it look like a bowling ball. Buzz sees the two sleazeballs park their car and walk towards the diner.

Maybe I could bowl in Japan.
What the fuck is this?
What's it look like to you?
What's it look like to you?
It looks like dwarf bowling.
I do what I gotta do to survive.
You have no right to call yourself a bowler. Buzz slaps Theo in the face.

I'm your blood.
I'm your blood.
You wish!
What makes you so sure it was me? She coulda had lotsa bowlers! Theo rushes Buzz and grabs his arm. The two men struggle for the pin.
Don't say that about my mom!
Don't say that about my mom!
I had a career. She wanted a little bowler of her own. Sid and Breeze leap into the fray, prying the two men apart. They wrestle Theo against a wall, pressing his face into the tiles.

You're dead without the pro-tour, and you know it. Get him away from me. Sid and Breeze punch Theo in the face.
Theo, I want you to get out of this town.
I'm getting to like it here.
I'm getting to like it here.

You got a better offer?

No...
No...
I didn't think so.
Not for somebody who hit a man with his ball on national television.
That's right, Buzz, and you know when I did it? Last match, last frame. All I needed was one spare for the crown - and I get stuck with the seven-ten, the Fazeli Split.

You never even took the shot. You couldn't do it. Theo moves towards Buzz in a threatening manner.

We ain't married no more.
He says that to all his wives.
The whole world thinks you're underground.
I am underground.
It could just as easily have been me in that box.
I told you to get lost. You forced yourself into this mess, so the mess accommodated you. Buzz straightens out and carefully remolds the bent out of shape halo.

Listen, if straight doesn't work out, you come work for me. Just make sure nobody's following you. Buzz's face is eerily lit by the glow of the sunset, his halo bouncing in the breeze.

I didn't mean that stuff I said. I was trying to keep you out of this muddle. I'm glad I didn't have my tubes tied. Oh, and by the way, I made a call for you before I - uh - retired. Buzz takes his card and scrawl on the back with a gold pen.

You give Ed Klein of the American Bowling Congress a call. Tell him your Maynard's boy. He's expecting you, and he owes me. He'll getcha back in like Flynn. Don't say I never gave you nothing.

Millie, I know what I'm doing.
We should leave this town. I can't take this anymore. I'm not gonna let him kill you in my house.
Son?
Millie, please. I don't have a son. I think you better leave now young man. Buzz gestures towards the front door.
My poor baby!
You see what you did? Take your ball and get out.
Hello?
Hello, mom?
Hello, mom?
Theodore? Where are you? Are you alright?
Theodore? Where are you? Are you alright?

Hey man, welcome to our parking lot. Lemme give you some advice, if she asks you to dance, make sure her brother's not around. Somebody blew out Junior's pilot light, if you get my meaning.

How's that?
How's that?
I was doing the lambada with her and the guy freaks, he breaks my arm, tries to kill me. I swear man, the guy thought I was a piata. If nobody else hadn't a been there, he wouldn't have stopped. He woulda killed me. Fuckin' guy man, just snapped. How do you like your burger?

Uh...over easy.
Uh...over easy.
I'll tell you one thing, you won't see me around that alley with that freak on the loose. Stay away from his ass - and don't play any of his fuckin' knock-knock jokes.
I don't like to talk about it.
You're prone to violent outbursts, aren't you?
You're prone to violent outbursts, aren't you?
It depends.
It depends.
It feels good to let it out, doesn't it? Sheila leans over and whispers furiously to her father.
Knock-knock.
Who's there?
Who's there!
Buzz Fazeli.
Buzz Fazeli.
NO. I SAY KNOCK-KNOCK! You say who's there. I say who's there and then you say who who. You're not playing right. Knock-knock.
NO. I SAY KNOCK-KNOCK! You say who's there. I say who's there and then you say who who. You're not playing right. Knock-knock.
Who's there?
JUNIOR! You're supposed to say JUNIOR WHO! I'm going to have to hurt you. Theo and Junior circle one another.
You shouldn't touch her.
You shouldn't touch her.
No, Junior, you shouldn't touch her.
No, Junior, you shouldn't touch her.
Nobody touches her. Except me. I touch her. Sheila told me you played bouncy- bouncy with her.
Nobody touches her. Except me. I touch her. Sheila told me you played bouncy- bouncy with her.
What did your dad tell you to do to Buzz? Theo scrambles up the lane on hands and knees. Junior catches him, grabbing his ankles.

You played bouncy-bouncy with Sheila, so I'm gonna play Blue-Face with you.
I don't want to play.
It's not so bad. When I'm alone, it feels like someone else. Sheila grabs the bottle from Junior, opens it and pours some on her shish kebab. She leans over and whispers furiously to her father.
Do you have to get your hooks into every guy I'm interested in?
Come on Sheila, knock-knock.
Who's there?
Who's there?
Junior.
Junior.
Junior who?
Junior who?
J'you-and-your-friend do it yet?
Junior's a problem child. He has a thing about -
SHEILA!
Come on, Junior. Everyone's waiting for you, son. The beam of light catches Junior's face. He is crouched inside the machine at lane six. Jr. His face is cut and bleeding and his straitjacket torn and filthy.
Needs lubrication. Lubrication.
Needs lubrication. Lubrication.
We're having a party for you, boy. Cake and shish-k-bob, just like you love. Junior cringes away from the light.

I have someone for you to play Blueface with Junior.
I have someone for you to play Blueface with Junior.
Blueface! Blueface is my favorite.
Weird, comes into alleys and doesn't bowl.
It's not an "Alley". I hate when people call it a "Bowling Alley", it's so common! I prefer "Bowling Center".
Someone gonna get kacked, boss?
If I find out Buzz is comin' up short on dwarf bowling, it's lights out for him and pink slips for you. Sid and Breeze look sideways at each other.
Hey, enough fun and games. We have work to do. Come on Junior. Kastle heads for his car. Junior gets up and follows. The two sleazeballs tarry as Theo stands.
If Junior thinks you're doing the bouncy- bouncy with his sister, he's gonna tap dance on your spleen.
Buzz has been moving the cash out in hollow bowling pins. Sid and Breeze throw sideways glances at each other.
No!
No!
I want you two to pick up Buzz and bring him to lane six. Junior will take it from there.
So you're Buzz's boy. I've been expecting you. You hurt my feelings when you didn't come and see me sooner.
You know who I am?
You know who I am?
Nobody sticks a finger into a bowling ball in this town without Miles Kastle knowing about it. You don't mind if I have a word with Theo, do you bunny? Kastle takes Theo by the elbow and pulls him away.

I heard you've been having a little trouble with the Congress. Theo pulls his eyes off Sheila. Kastle walks Theo past pairs of bowlers.

You might say I'm at the top of their shit list.
Maybe I can help you. Try a lighter ball, Penelope - you'll get hurt with that big ball, honey. I've seen tapes of you bowling on the circuit. You got Fazeli blood running through you. Your pop was a genuine talent in his day.

What's with the bad air between you two, Mr. Kastle?
What's with the bad air between you two, Mr. Kastle?
It's nothing, just a slight business imbalance. How's Gloria's thumb?
That's some pinfall. Almost a 133 average. Her ball's flat, she needs to work on her spin control.
That's right, didn't you have a slight control problem in a recent tournament,champ? Now go take out your "big four", darling. Come on, we're making her nervous.
Think of this business like a big aquarium. You gotta have some sharks to eat the dirt at the bottom so the guppies can swim free at the top.
Profits down there, philanthropy up here. Besides, it beats the pants off bingo.

If it springs a leak, it'll be because Buzz is making waves.

What if he wants to get out?
What if he wants to get out?
He's earned an early retirement. But enough about losers; Buzz Fazeli is history. Lets talk about your future. I wanna show you something.
Rac. R-A-C. Renovate, Automate, Computerize. That, my boy, is the future. One of the monitors shows a little girl bowling. Her ball moves so slowly it barely tips over the first pin. Kastle hits a key and the pins explode in an emphatic strike. The little girl jumps with joy.
What ever happened to just bowling?

There's a lot of competition for amusement out there. You gotta adapt to survive.

I like the sport the way it is.
I like the sport the way it is.
A guy like you could breathe some fire into bowling. You got ambition like a...like a...blowtorch. You go for what you want and anything that gets in your way - PSSSHHT! - shish kebabs. Maybe lady fate washed you up on my doorstep for your own good. I think I could help you, Theo.

You need a sponsor; I have influence. I could sponsor you.
You need a sponsor; I have influence. I could sponsor you.
Why would you help me?
Why would you help me?
I like you, Theo. You bowl with soul.
You already have a partner Mr. Kastle. Sheila walks over as the sleazeballs' car pulls out of the driveway.
I think Buzz is retiring soon. In fact, I think he's retiring tonight. Kastle pulls out a shiny gold credit card and holds it in front of Sheila.
Where's Junior?
He killed your stoolie embezzler father, and he's gonna kill you next! Sid and Breeze push him towards the van as the crowd's MURMUR increases. Kastle turns and yells over his shoulder.
Dad, this is ridiculous. Just open it.
Ssssh! Now real quiet. On three. One...two...three!
I bet you didn't know that you and Junior have something in common, Theo: Junior can't bowl anymore either. Isn't that right Junior? Kastle SLAMS the ketchup bottle down on Junior's right hand. The table settings jump from the shock. Junior sits impassively, his face a blank.
See! No feeling. Tell Theo what happened to your hand, Junior.
See! No feeling. Tell Theo what happened to your hand, Junior.
After we eat, Dad.
After we eat, Dad.
He stuck it in the ball return machine when he was a kid. Crushed all the nerve endings. Junior starts stroking the ketchup bottle with his dead hand.
You're just like you mother! Always jealous!
That's why Mom ran away, because you had to control everything!
That's why Mom ran away, because you had to control everything!
She ran away to be with that... that Motocross champion.
You're using Theo for your own deviant purposes!
Look who's talking!
Look who's talking!
Leave him alone!
Leave him alone!
Just because your mother signed part ownership of the lanes over to you, doesn't mean you have a right to tell me how to run my business! I can have my lawyers take that deed away from you like that. Sheila and Kastle sit up.
Fantastic! What talent.
You still got the touch Junior.
Don't go near the bowling alley.
Bowling "Center"!
Hello, Mr.Kastle.
Hello, Violet. How's my favorite 'bowlerina' doing?
Hello, Violet. How's my favorite 'bowlerina' doing?
132, 154.
132, 154.
You keep that up Carmelita and one day you'll be a champion just like Mr. Skinner here. What do you think, Theo? Think Carmelita's got the stuff?
I get them while they're young. Builds loyalty.
She hit it, Mr. Kastle!
She hit it, Mr. Kastle!
Four or five years when a girl like that's bowling on the pro tour for Team Kastle, she'll pay a handsome profit on my investment.
I just hold it loosely with both hands?
That's right, sugar, find the grip that's right for you. Then grasp firmly. The camera weaves past a five foot pink whale with a gaping green mouth leading onto a mini-green.

No, no, that's too far. Try a more gentle stroke. It's all in the stroke. Go ahead, now, honey - stroke. As the camera comes around the side of the whale, we see an elderly man in a fire hydrant red sports coat and white slacks hunched over a diminutive fiftyish woman. His back is to the camera and he is wearing a baseball

Yippy!
Is Mr. Fazeli in please?
Who wants to know? Zeus!
Who wants to know? Zeus!
I'm a bowler.
I'm a bowler.
I'm sick of you people. Why don't you leave him be?
Get that outta your mouth!
They suspended me.
He's not here.
I'm sorry about Zeus, Millie.
I'm sorry about Zeus, Millie.
This is a sign! Someone's coming to take Buzz away from me. I don't know if you're the guy or what, but I'm not letting it happen. I'm leaving him first.

He's no father to you.
Careful with that one. He won't tell me anything, but I know there's something strange going on over at the lanes. If you ask me, I'd say the old fart wants to die.
Where can I find him?
Where can I find him?
The Peter Pan.
What's your specialty?
Whips...orange whips.

Coming right up.
Do those two work for your dad or mine?
Mine, and they never tip.
Do you know where they're taking him?
Yeah, Babylon. Buzz runs the lanes there for my dad. Everybody who has anything to do with bowling in this town answers to my dad. Theo splits.
Here Theo, it's the Fazeli specialty; a seven-ten split. Theo looks down the lane and sees the two pins standing.
I'm not here to - I can't...
I came here to have a word with your dad.
What do you want with my dad?
What do you want with my dad?
Business.

Won't your father help you with that?

Your dad's one of the only nice people in this fucking town. My Dad is slime. Kastle walks over. Theo stands up and shakes Kastle's proffered hand.

So this brother of yours is hazardous to the health of your dates?
Nobody in this town really understands Junior. When I went to family sessions for him I realized he was the sanest one in the family. Actually, he's the only one in this whole fucking town who knows exactly who he is and what he wants.

Theo, what would you do if you couldn't bowl?
I don't know. It's all I ever wanted to do.
I don't know. It's all I ever wanted to do.
I wanted to be a motocross champion. My folks didn't really care what I did. Then Junior blew a fuse and I became their last hope. Most girls get ballet stuffed down their throats, I got bowling. I never understood how anyone could take it so seriously. I hope I'm not insulting you.

You're here.
What about the guy he put in the body cast?
Then it's true, isn't it? About...

It wouldn't bother you if Buzz was in danger, would it?

These open the back door. Don't let him catch you behind the machines; if he does, you're trapped. I'll meet you at the bridge. Theo takes the keys. Sheila grabs his arm.
You don't have to do this. We could just cut out of here, go to Akron, or anywhere else.

I did your dirty work for you Sheila, now fuck off. Theo drives away leaving Sheila standing alone. She watches his car recede with a thoughtful expression, then turns on her heel.
Why did you come back?
When I'm with you Sheila, I don't even think about bowling. Theo takes Sheila in his arms and kisses her passionately. She stops him and looks around nervously.

At least I'll die smiling.
Say something, Theo. Give me something. A doll's legs catch fire. Theo stares into Sheila's eyes.
Plan C. From now on it's gonna be plan C. Both bodies throb and grind, their sandy hands sliding over each others' sweaty skin.
Theo, Buzz is dead.
I didn't come this far to bury a guy that's not my dad. He owes me.

Now he's the one who's locked up and I'm the one who's free. If I gotta do this alone, I might as well start now. She revs up and peals out.

SSHHEEIILLAAA!
What makes you think you know me so well that you can give me an ultimatum? Huh?
Who said anything about an ultimatum? You want to find your father? Get a shovel and start digging. Hurry up, he's probably in Purgatory by now. Sheila makes a pathetic attempt to speed away from Theo. He moves up beside her again.

Some unfinished business.
If you wanna do business in this town, there's other people around here got more weight than old Faz.
You guys got something going on downstairs?
We provide some extracurricular activities for the senior citizens in the community.

Dwarf bowling's illegal.

You should probably hit the road. Go home. This place could get hazardous for your health.
So, Buzz was stooling for you guys.

The body was identified along proper Bowling Congress guidelines for processing a bowling related fatality.

I'm the next of kin. I should've seen him.
You faked my dad's murder. You used him! Where is he! Theo chases Sid and Breeze around their car. He catches Sid and grabs the middle fingers on his right hand. Sid howls.
Ow! Ooh! No, please! Doc said I'd be back on the planks in a week! Show him Breeze! Breeze pulls a copy of "New York Bowler" from his pocket. The headline reads "RUB OUT!:BOWLING LEGEND KACKED BY DWARFSCAM KINGPIN" with a photo of Buzz Fazeli.

Fletcher? What are you doing out there?
They're like pink snow, sir. Sticky.
They're warm. I can feel the heat on my legs.

How big is this spacecraft?
Of what we're able to measure, roughly twenty-six hundred feet.
In basic English, what does all this mean?
Basic English? There's no way this spacecraft was constructed on our planet.
There's heat coming the door.
Back away then.
Back away then.
Wait a minute --
Wait a minute --
I said back away.
I said back away.
Would you wait a minute?
Hold on --
What is it?
What is it?
Any of you get ahead of me -- walk this far up?
Alright, Beth, do that thing you did before.
How about I just press the button?
Not everything. Even on earth. Take ... yeasts.
Yeasts? Thank you, Beth, but I don't think we're gonna open it up and find a loaf of bread.
I am not leaving without him. Do you hear me? We come down as a team, we leave as a team.
What are you -- his mother? Get Norman, I want everyone ready to go. Edmunds, the subs?
Norman!
Edmunds, do you have a 20 on Norman?
The surface ships will be back. After the storm clears.
How long will that be?
They told me about sixty hours.
Two and a half days?
Back at the door -- I asked you to back away.
Yeah. I heard you.
Yeah. I heard you.
There are procedures, Beth, that I want followed. My procedures. And considering what's going on, I want you to follow them very closely.

Forgive me. I've never read the Navy manual. I wonder what it says about bathroom and shower procedures.
Nobody move.
But she's --
But she's --
Nobody move!
I'm not sure. I've never seen anything like it.
You're a fucking biochemist, aren't you? Can't you tell us something.
Nice work, Captain sir.
Shut up, Beth. I don't want to hear it.
Direction's east coming!
What was that?
A squid? The size of a whale? I don't think so. Target acquired. Sixty yards.
What if it attacks?

What are you saying -- we can't stop what's out there?
Where is it?
Why can't I -- ? What the hell is going on here?
What was that?
He's right beneath us.
Increase positive pressure!
That's our reserve air.
That's our reserve air.
It's either that or we grow gills.
Don't do it, Norman!
Do you see it?
Don't pull it, Norman. It'll start a <u>fire</u> we can't stop. Norman?
Do it, Norman, it's the only choice we have. This thing is gonna crush us.
Do it, Norman, it's the only choice we have. This thing is gonna crush us.
Norman, don't do it!

Now!
Norman, please! Don't!
Pull it, damn it!
Thank you, Colonel.
Captain.
Captain.
Captain. Right, forgive me.
Well, thanks for the opportuninty here -- my wife appreciates it.
Don't thank me, Dr. Johnson. You weren't my choice. The Pentagon made me take you.
Don't thank me, Dr. Johnson. You weren't my choice. The Pentagon made me take you.
The Pentagon? I didn't know I had friends in Washington.
Come with me. The team's already waiting.
What team?
What have you been told so far?
The usual. Plane crash. Survivers unknown. Routine stuff really.
The usual. Plane crash. Survivers unknown. Routine stuff really.
Anything else?
Anything else?
Nothing else.
You talk to any reporters? Any press?
Press? No, I haven't.
Good. Security's been our biggest worry. Now that you're here we can shut this thing down tight.
From what? What's with all the security?
From what? What's with all the security?
Well, we don't have all the facts yet.
We're moving fast considering the storm.
Storm? What storm?
Storm? What storm?
A cyclone's on it's way in. I thought they would have told you on the phone.

They didn't tell me anything.
How deep is he?
A thousand feet.

A thousand? An airplane crashes into a thousand feet of water -- I don't want to sound pessimistic here, but I assume there are no survivors.

Survivors? No, I wouldn't think so.
Then why am I here?

What?
What?
What do you need me for?
What is it? A military spacecraft? Like a shuttle or satellite?
Something like that. That doesn't surprise you?
Something like that. That doesn't surprise you?
Not really, no. Something of the military crashes in the ocean -- it explains why there was nothing on the news, why you've kept everything a secret... When did it crash?
Not really, no. Something of the military crashes in the ocean -- it explains why there was nothing on the news, why you've kept everything a secret... When did it crash?
As best we can estimate, it crashed four hundred years ago.
See this? Coral. Geologists measured the coral growth on top of the craft to be over five meters thick.
Geologists?

Coral grows at a rate of two and a half centimeters a year --

Extraordinary, isn't it?
Extraordinary, isn't it?
It's impossible.
It's impossible.
I'm afraid it is Dr. Johnson... because it's sitting on the bottom of our ocean floor.
Off the record, I don't mind telling you, this thing scares the shit out of me.
It doesn't make any sense.
It doesn't make any sense.
We think it might. That's why we brought you here. We've assembled your team -- they're waiting for us now.

The one you recommended. In the ULF report you wrote for the Bush administration.
The one you recommended. In the ULF report you wrote for the Bush administration.
ULF report? Nobody's mentioned that in years. You mean someone actually read it?
Your report's become our bible down here, Dr. Johnson. We've been carrying out each of your recommendations -- one by one -- to the smallest detail.
But sir, I don't understand. This report -- these recommendations... they're for an encounter with extra- terrestrial life.
They pressurize us with helium.
What's wrong with oxygen?
What's wrong with oxygen?
It's a corrosive gas. On earth, it makes a half-eaten apple turn brown and puts the ugly, iron rust on an Oldsmobile. At a pressure this low, oxygen becomes toxic. Breathe it down here, and it'll do to your dick what it does to the Oldsmobile.
What is it, Norman?
Take a look.
Picked up something? What is it?
I don't know. But it's something alien.
Maybe we shouldn't.
What?
What?
If it is alien, maybe we shouldn't try to open it at all.
Like "Thou shall not kill"?
Or maybe, it can't <u>be</u> killed.
Or maybe, it can't <u>be</u> killed.
You mean, what's in that thing is immortal?

I don't know. That's the point.
I don't know. That's the point.
Everything can be killed.
Don't get hysterical, Norman.
I'm telling you, Harry's lost it. He's saying there's a deathwish out for each of us.
I'm telling you, Harry's lost it. He's saying there's a deathwish out for each of us.
Look, the ships are clearing out. They're taking us topside in a matter of minutes. Someone can check him out there, if it's that imprtant.

Harry's missing.

He's missing. He's gone. He left.
He's missing. He's gone. He left.
He's here somewhere. Find him. The sub's on it's way. Go! C'mon!
You can't just leave Harry down here, sir.
I told you people, nobody goes anywhere unless I say.
I told you people, nobody goes anywhere unless I say.
But sir --
But sir --
No "buts". If he wants to be left, we'll leave him. Hello? Yes, the subs -- I want a report... Hello... Yes, a report. Gimme... shit.
I'm not paranoid. I know Beth. She can be drastic.
How drastic?
How drastic?
You don't want to know.
You don't want to know.
I think I do.
I think I do.
A while back, Beth and I -- we worked at the same university. She was assisting a chemist there -- I forget his name -- doing research, experiments. She was also living with him. Yeah, I know. And when she finished her work, he kicked her out, broke off the relationship, and published five papers -- all her work -- without any thank you

-- without a cautionary word to anyone. You know, Ted said something to me earlier. I think he's right. He said, "When you got a guy who -- if he wasn't here -- he'd be standing in the unemployment line, you gotta question if you got the right guy."
He translated it wrong. "My name is Jerry"? It's like "See Spot run."
The message doesn't show a lack of intelligence. It's smart. It's approaching us in a simple way. Like you would a dog. Holding out your hand, letting it sniff, get used to you.
The message doesn't show a lack of intelligence. It's smart. It's approaching us in a simple way. Like you would a dog. Holding out your hand, letting it sniff, get used to you.
What am I -- a dog, now?
Great, okay. Ask him about his weapons.
That's smart. Let's talk about guns and violence.
That's smart. Let's talk about guns and violence.
You don't think weapons are important?

Edmunds?

Edmunds? Can you copy?
What for?
If something should happen to us, the Navy will at least have partial records of what happened.
If something should happen to us, the Navy will at least have partial records of what happened.
At least our obituaries will be accurate. That's reassuring.
I don't want you talking to Jerry.
But sir, I think it's imperative. I think the messages, the animals we've seen, what killed Edmunds, the reading you got earlier -- I think they're all related.
You think he killed Edmunds?
Yes, I do. Whatever's out there, I think is his response to us refusing to talk to him earlier.
Yes, I do. Whatever's out there, I think is his response to us refusing to talk to him earlier.
Bullshit. What's out there isn't alien. It's an animal.
Bullshit. What's out there isn't alien. It's an animal.
Maybe so. But I think we need to ask Jerry about it.
Maybe so. But I think we need to ask Jerry about it.
No. I think we should shut down the communication lines inside the habitat. He might be listening now.
Going active.
Jerry?
What the hell? It shut us down.
Jerry? Please. Stop this.
Jerry? Please. Stop this.
Ted, go into the control room. Listen for my instructions.
Yes, sir. I'm here.
You see the lever on the green box? Upper right hand corner?
I see it.
Pull it.
Can you open that panel?
Working on it now, sir.
It's not sucking, sir.
Thank you, I can see that. Try something else.
Thank you, I can see that. Try something else.
We don't have anything else to try, Sir.
We don't have anything else to try, Sir.
Well, shit -- find something, do something... make something up --
What caused it?
Nothing. I don't know. Everything was normal. No changes at all.
Get him out of there. I thought I told you people --
Harry? Can you copy?
Subs are still at surface, sir.
Send them, damn it! I know, but I'm not gonna be held responsible --
I'm getting no sub reading, sir.
They're coming.
Any sign of Harry?
Nothing, sir.
Nothing, sir.
Fuck him. What? Hello?
Nothing, sir.
What the hell is going on here?
Yes, sir.
Well, where the fuck is he?
Well, where the fuck is he?
In the ship, sir.
Sir, if the subs haven't left by now...
They've left, keep watching!
They've left, keep watching!
Sir! Sir, the door -- it's opening.
Norman, get out of there now! Norman?
If the subs aren't here yet, sir --
Edmunds, get in here. I need you for this.
In a minute, sir.
How much damage?
To the craft? None. Not a scratch.
To the craft? None. Not a scratch.
Right. So you're saying it survived a high speed impact with water without a scratch?
Right. So you're saying it survived a high speed impact with water without a scratch?
I'm not saying anything, Harry, I'm just stating the facts. The outer metal is made of a titanium alloy, built into an epoxy- resin honeycomb. The necessary technology to bond this type of metal has never been invented.
It's chipped.
Chipped? The door? How can it be chipped?
Chipped? The door? How can it be chipped?
I don't know how it can be chipped, but it's chipped.
I don't know how it can be chipped, but it's chipped.
I thought you said there wasn't any damage done in the crash?

Then how can it be chipped?
Ted? Captain?
Yes, Harry.
Yes, Harry.
We know how this craft got here. Where it's been.
We know how this craft got here. Where it's been.
So do we. And it seems to have picked up something on it's travels.
No. They don't represent a message. They aren't decorative at all. They have another purpose entirely.
What?
What?
To conceal a small break in the surface of the sphere.
To conceal a small break in the surface of the sphere.
A break for what?
So how do we get it open?
Ted seems to have some ideas.
Man is man, all he knows is man, and all he can think of is what he knows. The anthropomorphic problem. Good, Norman.
The what?
So? What's the problem?
It's nonsense. There's enough difference between our own species to prove that.
Or it could contain some great benefit to us, some astonishing new idea or technology to help mankind.
It could. But the odds of it being any use to us are against it.
It could. But the odds of it being any use to us are against it.
You don't know that.
You don't know that.
Let's say whoever made this thing is a thousand years ahead of us, just like we are to, say, medieval Europe. Suppose you went back to medieval Europe with a TV set. There wouldn't be any place to plug it in.
Let's say whoever made this thing is a thousand years ahead of us, just like we are to, say, medieval Europe. Suppose you went back to medieval Europe with a TV set. There wouldn't be any place to plug it in.
Just tell me worst case. Worst case of what we might find?
Gimme a report, I want --
Ladies and Gentlemen...
Ladies and Gentlemen...
Who is that? Where's that coming from?
Who is that? Where's that coming from?
Please watch your closest monitor...
It's a single sequence repeated over and over.
We're all very proud of you, Harry, but what the hell is it?
... spiralling out of the center, you see: "G" is one, "B" is two, "H" is three, and so on... when I got the message.
What's the message?
What's the message?
I have to tell you. It's strange.
I have to tell you. It's strange.
How do you mean, strange?
Ignorant. The thing's ignorant.
It's not ignorant.
Are you enjoying yourself, Harry, because I don't know what the hell you're doing.
He understands me fine.
Not now, Beth. Please. I want to know who we're talking to before we start talking. Where's Edmunds?
She's not gonna know, sir.
What?
He's saying, "Take me to your leader." He wants to know who's in charge.
He's saying, "Take me to your leader." He wants to know who's in charge.
I'm in charge.
With an "o". Harold with an "o".
What -- you want me to retype it?
Edmunds? Get in here. I want to know exactly how this is being transmitted.
She's not gonna know.
She's not gonna know.
She wired this system.
She wired this system.
If the technology of that sphere is advanced enough -- the way it functions is gonna appear to us like magic.
A half a mile long?
The wing dimension alone is larger that any aircraft we've seen.
Captain, you know, I really appreciate you hauling us a thousand feet below sea level so we can watch this historical event on television.
Nobody goes inside, until we know <u>what's</u> inside.
I'd also like it noted --
Duly noted, Ted. Edmunds, try using suction.
What <u>about</u> a crowbar?
What if we go out there, you know -- wedge a crowbar in the door and pry the thing open.
Ted, get her away from the door.
What are you going to do -- shoot her?
Look at this.
What is it?
Some sort of lead or something.
Radiation shield, you think?
Radiation shield, you think?
A foot and a half thick? That'd withstand a helluva lot of radiation.
What's wrong?
What do you make of this?
We had considered it.
Considered what? That it's American? How would you think it's American?
Time travel. I always thought it was one of those myths... like Santa's reindeer.
What would we be working on in the future that would make us want to come back?
What would we be working on in the future that would make us want to come back?
Maybe we didn't want to come back.
But what does it do? This... sphere.
Maybe it's a message of some sort, you know? See this red here.
Can I stay, sir? I'm willing to risk it. I am. After what we just witnessed.
What? No, I know they're civilians...
Did you hear me, sir, because --
Ted, shut up. Are you packed? Ready to go? I want everyone packed. Now!
How can he be missing?
Sir, about leaving --
Sir, about leaving --
We're on the bottom of the fucking ocean -- he can't just walk outside!
They switched us over.
To what?
To what?
Internal power.
She says jellyfish are a delicacy. You know, I never knew that.
Get out of there. I don't want anyone going anywhere outside, understood?
From the sphere?
What's inside the sphere.
I want a name. A real name. This thing's full name, rank and serial number.
Captain, I personally feel we should ask much more substantive questions --
Captain, I personally feel we should ask much more substantive questions --
I am not gonna explain in some damn report that one person died in a deepsat expedition so we could meet an alien named Jerry.
It's not talking, it's mimicking.
Give him a chance. He's speaking our language, not the other way around.
Edmunds?
Don't make stuff up, these emotional theories, just so you can feel important here.
What is that?
The sensors are picking up something outside.
The sensors are picking up something outside.
What?
It won't register. It's too big to image.
Too big?
Well, until we know exactly what it is, nobody goes outside, understood?
What was Edmunds doing outside?
What was Edmunds doing outside?
Resetting the sub.
Resetting the sub.
What sub?
What sub?
In the dome hanger. All our tapes are transferred to the sub. It's on a 12 hour timer. If someone doesn't reset the "delay" button, the sub ascends to the surface with the tapes.
Beth, look, can I trust you with a little secret?
I love secrets.
I love secrets.

Do yourself a favor, Norman. Are you listening? Don't tell anyone what you just told me.

We can't go down there. We're not prepared. That deep? That takes years of training, Beth. We're just scientists. Lab scietists. We wear ties and lab coats to work -- not oxygen tanks.

Well, you must have realized the chances an encounter like this would happen here. In the ocean. 70 percent of the earth's surface is water, Norman. That's first grade geography.

Isn't there a psychological term for that, Dr. Johnson?
Yeah. Drowning.
You're next, Norman.
No. Go ahead. Really. Ladies first.
No. Go ahead. Really. Ladies first.
Such a gentlemen when you're scared shitless.
400 years ago? I'm sure Christopher Columbus would've loved these accomodations.
Good theory, Ted.
Norman!
Get this thing off me.
It could breathe in air and exhale cyanide gas.
Disrupt our brain waves, interfere with our ability to think.
Where'd this come from?

No, thank you. I hate jellyfish.
... when I was six, my younger brother and I -- we went swimming in the Pacific. At my mother's beach house. We both felt stinging, and when we came out of the water, he was wearing jellyfish head to toe. Killed him.
My gosh, Norman.
My gosh, Norman.
Yeah, it was awful.
Yeah, it was awful.
What about you? What happened to you?
What about you? What happened to you?
Me? Well, I was wrapped in seaweed. It itched for a while, but I survived. Beth, do you find it... curious that we're seeing all this life down here. Nothing, and then these enormous flocks of squid. Then jellyfish?

Normally, I'd say no. Everything's quiet now -- no ships, no divers, no electricity. Makes sense. But what's curious is -- these aren't normal jellyfish.

C'mon, Beth. Don't make this personal. He told me himself they were taking us back.
C'mon, Beth. Don't make this personal. He told me himself they were taking us back.
Yeah, he <u>told</u> you. Think. What was Barnes doing before they cut that cable loose? He was on the phone. Except that cable is a thousand feet long, Norman. They would've broken off communication with us four, five minutes before they cleared out.

No, I should stay calm. Like you say. Right, Norman? Stay calm.

"Our fisherman frequently see some that are more than four feet long. Some skeletons of squids...

"... according to calculations of some naturalists, one of these animals, only six feet long, would have tentacles 27 feet long. That would make a formidable monster."
After the attack, a Navy guy woke me up -- I don't know -- I thought he was an illusion. But I checked the tape, and Jerry said he manifested him.
Manifested?
Manifested?
Created. Brought to life. I don't know. But at the end, Jerry said, "Stop calling me Jerry". And --
He translated it wrong.
What?
Remember when we first spoke to Jerry, Barnes kept asking for Jerry's real name? But Harry never would? He didn't because he was afraid the screen would say "Harry", instead of Jerry. We weren't talking to an alien intelligence when we talked to Jerry, we were talking to Harry... or a part of Harry.

I don't know, Beth. I'm not the fucking alien that built the thing. But it can. When Harry came out of the sphere, he mumbled something about page 87. How he would never read that far -- he was too scared to. Then you found the book, remember in your lab. Then in the cafeteria -- and page 87 talks about a giant squid...

No. I mean, we've always believed we can think anything we want without consequences. You ever read the Bible? It talks about our sinful nature, you know? I mean, we can think, and believe, and desire whatever we want, but there's a part of us -- a shadow side, as Jung called it -- that can't be controlled. It's evil. It's inside us. It's
And that's the part of Harry that's being manifested.

You're not sorry. You're scared. You're a psychologist, Norman. You pride yourself on knowing when someone's lying to you, not telling you the truth. And now you're scared ... because you're not sure you can tell anymore.
What is it, Norman?
Where are you?

When you were in that sub -- and that squid was attacking you -- are you sure it was the squid that was attacking? Do you know? "I can't get Beth on the radio. I'm in this tiny sub on the bottom of the fucking ocean. All alone. Surrounded by all this water." Was it really the squid that was attacking you, Norman --

It's not me, Beth. I swear. It can't be.
It's not me, Beth. I swear. It can't be.

It's not safe for you to be either.
It's not safe for you to be either.
You think I care? You think I care if I die? Would I put explosives around the habitat -- set on vibration sensors -- that can trigger automatically, if I cared about myself? Would I?

This is what I'm talking about, Norman. Don't you see? It's in you. This vindictiveness. This rage.
Get away from the door, Beth.
Of course you're going to deny it. You want to blame someone else. You want to blame Beth. Because you hate Beth.
Don't fuck with me, Beth.
Don't fuck with me, Beth.
I'm not fucking with you, Norman. You've fucked yourself.
Beth!
You're frightened, aren't you, Norman?
Where is it coming from, Beth?
Don't you know?
Beth, stop it!
Stop what? Don't blame me. It's not me.
Then where's it coming from?
From you, Norman. From your mind. You're doing it.
Stop it!
It's you, Norman. Your fear of drowning. You have to face it.
Beth?
Leave me alone, Norman.
You can't stop it, Norman. You can't fight me.

Let's get out of here, Beth. Let's go home.
What is that? What are you doing?
What?
What?
You hear that?
You hear that?
Hear what?
Hear what?
Get away from me!
Get away from me!
Beth --
Beth --
Get away --
Would it work?
Yes. And I think we already know it will.
Yes. And I think we already know it will.
How's that?
How's that?
Down below, Harry said we would all have to die. Since there was no evidence on that spacecraft that anybody knew time travel through a black hole was possible -- and we all knew -- then we would all have to die before we could tell anyone. Death was the only logical explanation. But sitting here, we still know. So how is that possible?
Pussy.
What's that -- mistake number two, Norman?
No. I don't think so.
Well, think. Because there's footprints here that aren't mine.
Well, think. Because there's footprints here that aren't mine.
Well, they're not mine.
I don't get it.
It doesn't make any sense.
Well, what's your theory?
I'm a woman. I don't theorize. I only deal with facts.
Norman? Where's Norman?
By the bunks.
He doesn't wait for an answer.
Who says it's a he?
Pry the thing open? What are we -- neanderthals?
All that banging and pounding. I don't know. We should think about making a good first impression.
All that banging and pounding. I don't know. We should think about making a good first impression.
For who? The fish?
For who? The fish?
For whoever's in that thing.
It's empty. Why would someone build a ship like this?
You'd have to ask them.
Then what is it?
It's an American spacecraft.
What are you looking for?
A light switch. A button opened that door -- the craft runs on some sort of power.
Take politics, our views on abortion, the death penalty...
Cannibalism, to be extreme. And now we're talking about a new life form. Their values and ethics may be incomprehensible.
When he woke up, he said we were out of food. He told me to get some from the ship.
I never said that.
I never said that.
Yes you did. Norman, I wouldn't leave you out there. You know that.
Yes you did. Norman, I wouldn't leave you out there. You know that.
We never even had a conversation, Norman.
We never even had a conversation, Norman.
Harry? That's bullshit. We stood right there --
Jerry. Right. I said Jerry, didn't I?
That's a hell of a mistake to make, Beth.
That's a hell of a mistake to make, Beth.
I'm sorry. Slip of the tongue.
I'm sorry. Slip of the tongue.
Yeah, I don't know how you could make that confusion.
Just in time, too.
In time for what?
In time for what?
What?
What?
Just in time for what?
Our habitat, I mean. This place can't handle another attack.
Another attack?
Why are you looking at me like that?
Like what? I'm not --
Like what? I'm not --
You're staring at me.
You're staring at me.
No I'm not. I'm not star--
No I'm not. I'm not star--
Yes you are...
They're going to want answers and they're going to keep asking until they get them.
We can refuse to talk.
We can refuse to talk.
Won't make any difference. The tapes document everything.
When did it come across?
Minutes ago. Harry's trying to decode it in his room now.
Minutes ago. Harry's trying to decode it in his room now.
Where's it coming from?
Where's it coming from?
No idea. We have no surface support. It transmitted too fast to be coming from underwater.

Is it coming from our own computer?
Is it coming from our own computer?
Harry thinks it's some sort of discharge from our own system, but I've seen it discharge before -- and it didn't look anything like this.
How are you feeling, Norman?
What?
What?
You holding up alright?

Fine. I'm fine.
Fine. I'm fine.
Don't be defensive.

I'm not being defensive.

You sound defensive.

I'm fine.
Go ahead. Ladies first.
No, why don't --
C'mon.
Wait a second, I --
C'mon, Norman.
Look, would you --
Nice work, Norman.
Whatever I can do to help.
Our answer.
To what?
To what?
Time travel. A black hole.
This answers one of our questions.
Which one? Let me get the list out.
Which one? Let me get the list out.
This spacecraft was designed to pick things up. They see things they want -- these claws go out and bring it in. They come across this. This... <u>sphere</u>. Find it interesting, curious. They draw it inside to take back home.

But on the way home, they miss their turn, go too far, into the past.
But on the way home, they miss their turn, go too far, into the past.
Our present.
I mentioned it in my report. Didn't you read the report?
Everything ever written about extra- terrestial life imagines that life is essentially human. If it doesn't look human, it's a reptile or a big insect or something, having human values, human understanding.
And we're just talking about three- dimensional creatures. What if it's five or six or seven-dimensional? So dimensional that we couldn't even see it to kill it.
Good point. I don't know what you're talking about, but good point.
Don't be so optomistic, Harry.
I'm completely serious. There is something very important missing from that spacecraft. You know what that is?
I'm completely serious. There is something very important missing from that spacecraft. You know what that is?
Not a clue.
Not a clue.
A sign that the builders knew time travel through a black hole was possible.

I don't follow you.
I don't follow you.
On that flight recorder, they called the black hole an "Unknown Entry Event." They didn't know what a black hole was. Fifty years from now, men are going to build that ship in a very tentative, experimental way, with no knowledge that time travel through a black hole is possible.

So what?
So, <u>we know</u>. We know it went through a black hole. We saw it. Norman -- when we'd get to the surface, we'd tell someone about the black hole, wouldn't we? It'd go in some report like some big discovery. So in fifty years when they build that ship, they'd make precautions for a black hole. <u>But they didn't</u>. The called it an Unknown
Meaning we're never gonna get the chance to tell anyone.
Meaning we're never gonna get the chance to tell anyone.
Meaning we're never gonna get to the surface alive... to tell anyone.
I can't believe that, Harry.
Gimme another explanation.
I can't. If I had a minute to think, maybe, but I know you're wrong.
Am I?
Am I?
Look -- we're under a lot of pressure, we're tired, you're not thinking straight.
Look -- we're under a lot of pressure, we're tired, you're not thinking straight.
You mean, you think I'm cracking?
You mean, you think I'm cracking?
No. I didn't say that.
No. I didn't say that.
Then what, Norman?
It's what's in that sphere, isn't it, Harry? Whatever you think is in that thing -- you think it's going to kill you.
Curious, isn't it? What's inside? Before I die, I'd sure like to open it and see.
What is that? That noise?
What noise?
What noise?
It's like...
Harry, can you tell me about the sphere?
What are you still doing here?
What are you still doing here?
You remember opening the door?

You were all supposed to leave. You weren't supposed to stay down here.

You don't understand about the sphere.

Then explain it to me.
Norman?
What is it, Harry?

What happens on page 87? Have you ever read page 87?

I could never read that far. I never wanted to.
I could never read that far. I never wanted to.
That far in what, Harry?
These aren't half bad, Fletcher. You might have a second career coming.
What are they?
Getting anywhere with those?
There's some sort of pattern here. It'll take a minute.
There's some sort of pattern here. It'll take a minute.
Have you looked outside? Jellyfish. Everywhere. I hate jellyfish. Harry, what happened in the cafeteria?

Don't do this. Don't psychoanalyze me. I hate squid. Period. Just like you hate jellyfish.
Don't do this. Don't psychoanalyze me. I hate squid. Period. Just like you hate jellyfish.
You said something to me, before -- about how we were all going to die.
You said something to me, before -- about how we were all going to die.
Did I?
Did I?
You don't remember that?
You don't remember that?
I don't remember much. It's like my memory is on the tip of my tongue -- but I can't taste any of it. Funny, my senses are much keener though. Purer. Hearing, seeing, smelling. Like, I can smell your sheets, Norman. You tried to wash it out earlier, But I can still smell the urine. Don't worry, I'm not going to tell the others.
... you there? Norman?
Harry?
Harry?
Norman, where are you?
Norman, where are you?
I can't breathe... Am I... clear?
I can't breathe... Am I... clear?
You're clear. You see the airlock?
Thank you. My suit -- Beth said she fixed it --
What happened to her?
What happened to her?
What do you mean? She's not here?

When I woke up, nobody was here.

Beth left?

I thought she was with you.
She's cracking, Norman.
You didn't say that about the food?
You didn't say that about the food?
I was just in the cafeteria, there's plenty of food in there. Take a look for yourself.
I was just in the cafeteria, there's plenty of food in there. Take a look for yourself.
But why would she -- ?
But why would she -- ?
She's lying, Norman. Just like she lied about fixing your suit.
Wisconsin's your answer.
Wisconsin?
Wisconsin?
Navy transmission. They're sent from Wisconsin.
Navy transmission. They're sent from Wisconsin.
How do we decode it?
How do we decode it?
Don't have to. Watch. It'll do it for you.
We just figured, you know, the three of us -- we need to... work together through this.
The three of us.
The three of us.
That's right.
That's right.
Is that why the two of you went through my dufflebag?
What is it?
You know what it is, Harry.
It's the squid! Stop it!
Stop what? What are you -- ?
Did I kill her?
I don't think so.
I don't think so.
I could hit her a little harder. More toward the cranium.
Fine.
Help me lift her.
We're never gonna make it.
Shut up and open the door.
How much time you figure to get to the surface?
Two and a half minutes. Once we're in the sub.
Two and a half minutes. Once we're in the sub.
How far away's the sub?
I can't reach her.
Hold on.
Push her, c'mon.
I'm trying. Shit. Here -- catch her.
Missed.
Are you trying, damn it? Just --
Hold on.
Hurry, Norman. Four minutes.
Hurry, Norman. Four minutes.
I heard! I heard!
Three fifty-six, three fifty-five, three --
Shut up and catch.
C'mon, Norman!
I'm trying to keep balance with --

Gimme a second --

Just pull her -- down like inside -- Harry, work with me here!
Just pull her -- down like inside -- Harry, work with me here!
Her legs are in the way.
Her legs are in the way.
You got her?
Get her out of the seat, I need room to sit. Harry?
I'm trying. There.
You know how to work this thing?
No idea.
No idea.
Well, press something!
Well, press something!
Wait!
Less than a minute, we're never gonna make it.
Nine hundred feet to surface.
Nine hundred feet to surface.
It's not fast enough, Norman. There's a helluva lot of explosive down there.
How's that working out, by the way?
Good. Thank you. Now that I have it on. Why are you laughing? You don't even know what that means.
Good. Thank you. Now that I have it on. Why are you laughing? You don't even know what that means.
No. I don't. But I always said to myself, when I die, I want to die laughing.
There is one possibility.
We all kill ourselves? Bad joke. Sorry, Beth.
The power allows us to manifest our fears, right? What if we feared the power to go away?
You mean forget?
You mean forget?
It would erase all our knowledge of it. All of our power.
What'd you say to him?
To who? Arthur? Nothing. Nothing that Norman doesn't already know.
To who? Arthur? Nothing. Nothing that Norman doesn't already know.
What does Norman already know?
What does Norman already know?
Norman thinks we shouldn't be going down. Thinks it's a mistake.
She told me what you said, Norman.
What is it, Harry?
What is it, Harry?
Just one of Norman's many secrets.
It's just like swimming, Norman... You know how to swim, don't you?
You're not afraid of the water, are you, Norman?
Easy Ted, we're not mining gold.
Gimme some room here, will you? Back off. Gimme some space.
Alot like. You know, I noticed it before, but I didn't...
Shutup, Ted. You didn't notice shit. Keep hammering.
English?
That's right.
You don't think it does? I think it's rather obvious.
Is it some sort of joke? Like one of those hoaxes?
Is it some sort of joke? Like one of those hoaxes?
A spacecraft half a mile long -- with 500 tonnes of coral on top of it? Someone went to a lot of trouble. Try again.
A spacecraft half a mile long -- with 500 tonnes of coral on top of it? Someone went to a lot of trouble. Try again.
But it's impossible.
But it's impossible.
Is it?
Why would this ship carry instructions in English?
Think about it.
Think about it.
Unless, this alien spacecraft was -- you know -- somehow presenting itself to Americans in a way that would make us feel comfortable.
All the facts you need are right in front of you.
Gimme a minute here... I think I've got it.
Gimme a minute here... I think I've got it.
Do you?
Do you?
If it is an alien spacecraft --
If it is an alien spacecraft --
Save your breath. It's not an alien spacecraft.
An American spacecraft? Half a mile long? And buried 400 years? Yeah, good theory, Harry.
It's been obvious from the start, hasn't it, Captain? That's why all the secrecy, why no one was told about it?
We take a weeny little wedge, bang on it a couple of times, and bust off a chunk of the metal. Yet any spacecraft -- even at a low velocity, say 200 miles an hour -- crashes into the water -- it's gonna be like hitting concrete, it would crumple like paper. But there isn't a dent to be seen anywhere. Not even a
Meaning?
Meaning?
Meaning it didn't land in the water.
Meaning it didn't land in the water.
Please. It must have flown here --
Please. It must have flown here --
It didn't fly here. It <u>arrived</u> here.
It didn't fly here. It <u>arrived</u> here.
Arrived? From where?
Arrived? From where?
Not where. When. 400 years ago. From our future.
Looks like a design, some writing, maybe. Maybe it was sent to meet the spacecraft with a message.
Look closely. That isn't writing. Those are grooves.
Hey, go easy on the salt, will ya? We're not a bunch of icy streets here.
Salt's good for you, Ted. Helps you from getting impotent.
Salt's good for you, Ted. Helps you from getting impotent.
Impotent? I'm not impotent.
Well, if it's a discharge --
It's not a discharge. Right, Edmunds? You said before, right? So it's gotta be a message.
If it is a message, it's probably a substitution code. I'll work on it.
Yeah, I'll work on it, too.
... I asked myself, why would the sphere be using a code? If you're trying to communicate, why use a code?
See? No code. What'd I say?
See? No code. What'd I say?
Codes are for <u>hiding</u> information. So it's making a mistake. It's making a code without intending to. I figured it's probably substituting numbers for letters... Then I began to wonder what an alien intelligence would make of our keyboard. And since we're getting spirals, I imagined the keyboard as a spiral. So I translated it...
What'd you say?
"We are friends".
Good idea, Ted.
Thank you.
Don't gimme that psychology bullshit, Norman. Psychology isn't a science, it's superstition. It's a bunch of soft, subjective theories without any hard data to back it up. With an intellect like this, emotions don't mean shit.
It's like showing Leonardo da Vinci a laptop computer. He'd run screaming "witchcraft". And you couldn't explain it to him, either. Modems, microchips, particle physics.
Norman Johnson.
Does this mean what I think it means?
Does this mean what I think it means?
It's over, sir, The storm has cleared.
It's over, sir, The storm has cleared.
The ships?
The ships?
They're topside. We're ready to take you home, sir.
How are the others?
The others, sir?
The others, sir?
Beth and Harry?
Beth and Harry?
They're in the sub, sir. Waiting.
That whole time -- I couldn't stop thinking of what Harry was saying earlier...
What was that, sir?
What was that, sir?
About the time paradox. How we were all going to die -- that there was no way we would make it out of here alive --
Any other bags, Dr. Johnson?
Just that. Careful, it's heavy.
No other equipment? Scientific instruments?
No, they didn't say --
No, they didn't say --
This way, sir.
Captain Barnes wants to see you right away, sir.
Captain who?
Captain who?
Barnes. He's very eager to meet you. Been calling us every half hour to see if you're arrived.
Barnes. He's very eager to meet you. Been calling us every half hour to see if you're arrived.
Really?
By the way sir, I've read your report. I think it's brilliant.
What report?
What report?
You mean they haven't told you yet?
You mean they haven't told you yet?
Told me what?
I'm in psychology. Was. Still am really, just been a while. I treat aircrash survivors.
Oh, so you're that Dr. Johnson.
Oh, so you're that Dr. Johnson.
You've heard of me?
You've heard of me?
Well, everybody's been talking about that report you wrote.
Well, everybody's been talking about that report you wrote.
What report?
What report?
Huh?
Huh?
What report?
What report?
You mean you don't know?
You mean you don't know?
Know what?
Must be another Johnson then. Been flying so many scientists out here -- can't keep everyone straight.
Who's everyone?
Who's everyone?
Physicists, mathematicians, geologists, you name it.
Physicists, mathematicians, geologists, you name it.
Geologists? At a plane crash?

Strange, isn't it? In the middle of the ocean no less.
Strange, isn't it? In the middle of the ocean no less.
What the hell would a geologist be doing at a plane crash?
He wasn't feeling well.
He's a pussy.
You want me to try?
You're a 53 year old shrink, what are you gonna do?
Strange, isn't it? You know -- how it would have a button.
Earth doesn't have a patent on buttons, Ted.
Earth doesn't have a patent on buttons, Ted.
Still, make a note I recognized that.
He's manic, Norman. You know that? This reliance on Harry is misplaced. You hear me? Totally misplaced. He's overlooking things. Obvious things.
Like what?
It's not some fucking substitution code, it's a direct visual representation.
You mean a picture?
You mean a picture?
Take a look. I rearranged the numbers. Put 'em up to the light. Go ahead. Squint at it.
Take a look. I rearranged the numbers. Put 'em up to the light. Go ahead. Squint at it.
I don't see anything.

Squint harder.

Please, Ted.
Please, Ted.
Try this one.
Try this one.
This is like nursery school.
This is like nursery school.
Don't you see it? It's a picture of the creature.
Don't you see it? It's a picture of the creature.
The creature?
The creature?
Inside the sphere. Look, that's the vertical torso, three legs, two arms. There's no head, so I'm guessing the creature's head is located within the torso itself, you know?
Well, how about we wait and see what Harry comes up with?
Sure, why not. Give him the trophy. That pretentious son of a bitch. You heard him, Norman. All that "someone went to a lot of trouble, try again" bullshit. And "impotent". Where does he get off saying I'm impotent? He's a fucking self-righteous, little prick.
Well, he's polite.
Unless it's an act.
You want to put him on your couch, Norman. Grill him about his childhood?
When he uses a phrase like "I am Happy", I think we should think twice about what we ask him.
Frankly, Ted, I'd be much happier if Jerry was just a cold, emotionless intellect.
Why's that?
What was it?
Barnes didn't know. Couldn't get a reading.
Barnes didn't know. Couldn't get a reading.
Has Harry spoken with Jerry?
Has Harry spoken with Jerry?
Not that I know of. Why?
You think Jerry has something to do with what killed Edmunds? With what's out there?
I'm not sure.
Jerry isn't hostile, Norman. He said earlier -- we were his friends --
Of course he did. He's been isloated for 400 years. He wants someone to talk to. Look, you put a human being in isolation for four days, they can become neurotic, sometimes psychotic. We're talking about 400 years here. An alien that shows emotional responses. I think we need to address him, before he reacts further.
What kind of a crash was it?
You seen my suitcase?
You seen my suitcase?
There's nothing on the news about a crash. Did he say what airline?
There's nothing on the news about a crash. Did he say what airline?
He didn't say much at all. Honey --

In the closet. I don't understand, Norman -- why would they call you?

Well, I can't imagine five years of unemployment --

Keep watching the news. Are you watching the news?
Keep watching the news. Are you watching the news?
How are you getting to the airport? You need money for the bus?
There's a U.S. Navy car outside, Norman.
What?
What?
Was it a military crash?
Was it a military crash?
I don't know.
I don't know.
They never used to send a Navy car.
I'm Han Solo, Captain of this vessel. Who's in charge then?
I'm Ben Kenobi. Luke Starkiller here is leading our expedition.
Well, we'll see...
You might get your stuff together. We'll be coming up on Organa Major soon.
The Empire must have gotten here first.
The planet has been totally blown away! It would have taken a thousand ships with a lot more fire power than I've ever seen... If the Empire had a new weapon that could do this... I would have heard something... I'd know about it.
The planet has been totally blown away! It would have taken a thousand ships with a lot more fire power than I've ever seen... If the Empire had a new weapon that could do this... I would have heard something... I'd know about it.

Well, now you know... The enemy is on the move. We haven't much time.
Well, I've brought you here. What now?
Well, I've brought you here. What now?
We have to find he rebels... What we're carrying belongs to them.
We have to find he rebels... What we're carrying belongs to them.
Their bases are very well hidden. All the power of the Empire can't find them... Do you know where they are?
No, not anymore.
I'm not taking you on an impossible search across the galaxy... I was only paid to get you here and now you're here. I'll take my other five thousand and you're on your own... I'll leave you on the nearest system.
Well, for one reason, we don't have your other five thousand.
Who's going to pay me then?
Who's going to pay me then?
I think there are some things we should talk about.
I think there are some things we should talk about.
I'm beginning not to like you.
How much do you think she's talking about?
A million at least... If this robot has information related to the destruction of Organa Major, you'll be able to name the reward...
A million at least... If this robot has information related to the destruction of Organa Major, you'll be able to name the reward...
Anything I want! Now that's interesting.
Luke's got a point... ... Fear is their greatest defense... I doubt if the actual security there is much greater than on Aquilae or Sullust, and what there is is most likely directed toward large-scale assault.
This isn't a game, you know.
Kid, you take the glory and the good intentions and I'll take the reward.
Fear is their greatest weapon.
Fear is their greatest weapon.
I'm not afraid of anything...
You have your father's style. You've done very well.
Not bad.
We're into the second perimeter. They'll be coming out to blast us shortly. I was wondering if you had some kind of a plan or are we going to try to blast our way in?
Check your data banks for all the information you have on Imperial procedures. Both of you will have to learn...

We're going to get in by studying Imperial procedures? I don't like it.
All right then, we'll use your plan.
I'll get the information.
... and I want you to start cleaning the equipment out of the scan- shielded compartments.
... and I want you to start cleaning the equipment out of the scan- shielded compartments.
What do you want with our scan-proof lockers?
Darth Vader is on this system. I can feel him. I can feel the Kiber Crystal.
Is that good or bad?
Is that good or bad?
It's not good... unless I could find the Crystal. Then it could be very good.
Don't look at me. I'm just a pilot. I got you here... You've got to do the rest.
There is a greater risk in staying here, you know. If you don't find the princess, then the whole trip was for nothing... wasn't it?
There is a greater risk in staying here, you know. If you don't find the princess, then the whole trip was for nothing... wasn't it?
I'm not going out there.
That's straight through the central core... up toward the top of the city... Once you've got her, avoid the main transports, they'll shut down immediately. Your only chance is through the service shafts. There are no sensors there... All right now, get going, you don't have time. I hope you can remember everything.
We'll be back before you are, old man.
We'll be back before you are, old man.
May the Force be with you.
Good morning!
What do you mean, 'good morning'? Do you mean that it is a good morning for you, or do you wish me a good morning, although it is obvious I'm not having one, or do you find that mornings in general are good?

All of them altogether. You seem to have gotten yourself into a fine mess! What happened?
Sorry, but that was the only way to get you down.
Couldn't we have tried to think of something else first!

You're lucky those Tuskens didn't boil you before they hung you out to dry. They're not the friendly sort. You'd best be moving on before they come back.
I'm Luke Starkiller, guardian of the Bendu.
Oh, so you're a warrior then?
Oh, so you're a warrior then?
Of course. I'm a Bendu officer.
Who are you anyway?
You might say I'm part of the landscape here. They call me Ben Kenobi.
You're General Kenobi?!? The Jedi knight! The commander of the White Legions?
I'm afraid it's been a long time since the White Legions roamed the stars. But I have the memories.
I don't see why. I don't believe we've ever met.
I am the son of Annikin Starkiller.
I know who you are. Stand up so that we can talk properly. You're embarrassing me. I'm not that important.
But you are... I know your 'Diary of the Clone Wars' by heart. My father...
I... I'm not a Bendu Officer. I'm not even a startrooper.
I know that.
I know that.
You saw through me?

You could put it that way.

I assure you my intentions weren't bad.

I know your intentions. I probably know much more about you than you realize. In many ways you're a lot like your father. He was an indulgent man, but a clever warrior. Now what brings you out here?
I know your intentions. I probably know much more about you than you realize. In many ways you're a lot like your father. He was an indulgent man, but a clever warrior. Now what brings you out here?
My father told me many stories about you. He said if I was ever in trouble, to come here... I need your help.
I'm afraid I've gotten too old for this sort of thing.
But you must! I can't do it alone. I'm not at all like my father. I'd never make it.
But you must! I can't do it alone. I'm not at all like my father. I'd never make it.
I already know you think you're worthless. I recommend you learn to think of yourself in a better light, for what you believe you are is what you become. I haven't been involved in anything like this for many years.

But the Sith Lords are involved! Whatever information this R-2 unit is carrying, it must be awfully important. They're probably looking for him... I'm no match for the Sith. This is a Jedi's work. This is your responsibility!

Not any more!
You were right. It is my responsibility. The Force of Others brought the message to you and then it brought you to me.
My father used to talk about the Force of Others. But he never told me what it was...

Let's just say the Force is something a Jedi Warrior deals with. It is an energy field in oneself, a power that controls ones acts, yet obeys ones commands. It is nothing, yet it makes marvels appear before your very eyes. All living things generate this Force field, even you.

Could I learn to feel it?
That is not a human decision, not your or mine.
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
It means you'd better get some rest. We'll be leaving for Mos Eisley first thing in the morning. The trip will be difficult and dangerous, but it's the only spaceport with ships large enough to get us to Organa Major. Now go on!
Luke, I'm coming along to do what I can, but I'm tired and I'm depending on you to get us through.
But you're still a powerful Jedi. You don't need my help.
But you're still a powerful Jedi. You don't need my help.
A Jedi's power is measured by the amount of the Force that is stored within him, and I have little of the Force left in me.

When a creature dies, the force it generated remains. The Force is all around us. It can be collected and transmitted through the use of a Kiber crystal. It's the only way to amplify the power of the Force within you.

Like Bogan weather, or bogan times. I thought that was just a saying.
There are two halves of the Force of Others. One is positive and will help you if you learn how to use it. But the others half will kill you if you aren't careful. This negative side of the Force is called the Bogan, which is where the expression came from, and it is the part that is used by the Dark Lords to
We don't have that kind of money. How much do you think I can get for the speeder?
Five, maybe. Let me handle it.
This is the last place. Shouldn't we just take what we can get and think of something else?
He's bluffing...
When we get Artoo's message to them, you think they'll try to rescue the princess?
I doubt it. It would be foolish for the rebel forces to come out of hiding. I know your feelings. You'd best forget them. It's for your own good. There will be no saving her from the prisons of Alderaan. It's the heart of the Sith. The Bogan Force is the most heavy there.

What's wrong? What's happening?
Keep away, I'm fine, I'm fine.
Are you all right?
Yes... the Force... something horrible has happened. I couldn't see what it was, or where it was, but it was terrible... terrible beyond description... the cry of millions dying at once.
Are you sure you don't need it?
I rarely use it any more. I have the Force. The Force is more powerful than any pistol. You shouldn't put too much faith in that weapon. Work on becoming aware of the Force... learn to feel its presence within you. Try to sense what it's telling you. It's the only thing you can rely on.

What do I do?
What do I do?
All you have to do is lose your thinking self. Don't focus on anything. Let your body do your thinking... You have to learn to act on what you feel, not what you think ... If I had the crystal, it would be much easier. You could feel the Force immediately... but for now, let yourself go. You'll pick it up... and someday you'll
What is it?
He can't find Organa Major.
But she is the only link between us and the hidden bases.
You mean we should go after her!...
You mean we should go after her!...
I didn't say that, but it appears to be a logical alternative.
I can't see! How can I fight?
Try to feel it. Use the Force...

I can't do it. I'll get hit.
I can't do it. I'll get hit.
Stop thinking, and start feeling. Let yourself go.
See, once you let yourself go you can do it. You'll get it.
I don't get it, but I guess I did block it.
What about the princess?
You go after the princess. I am an old man and would be of little help. I must try to find the Crystal.

I'm not going alone!
The Kiber Crystal.
Keep it with you always. You'll have more need of it than I. It will bring the Force to you. You've already learned to feel it... Now you must learn to use it.
Of course, where you been kid?
You look great! The uniform and everything!
That's no battle, kid... They're just sitting there!
But there was a lot of firing earlier...
I'll tell you, Luke, and this is between you and me. The star force isn't all it's cracked up to be. Frankly, it's a bore, and it's going to stay that way as long as this system is neutral...
But you always said things were so great at the academy... What happened?
But you always said things were so great at the academy... What happened?
The academy is fantastic... Of course, they won't teach you anything about flying you don't already know. Most of the instructors are very conservative pilots. You can fly circles around them... but there is a lot on the scientific side that is down-right amazing, and you get a lot of discipline... but after you graduate, don't join the star force -- go free-lance. It's

At least you're doing something... I'd give anything to be in your position.

Just be warned, that things aren't always as they seem... especially the starforce recruiting posters.
You're Starkiller?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Have you been checked out?
Have you been checked out?
Yes, sir. I was considered one of the best bush pilots on Sullust. I've also had six hours on the T-2.
Six hours, huh? Well, that's your ship there. You're blue five. You stay glued to me. I don't want any independent operations out there. Personally I think it's foolish for them to be sending fresh kids out on a job like this. This is no joy ride we're going on.
Yes, sir.
Blue Five, does that glare bother you?
I've got it blocked. I'm all right.
I'm right behind you, Blue Leader.
What's that?
Blue Five, break off your cover attack. It's too late. Make your own run on the exhaust port. Do you copy, Luke?
Yes, sir, but I can get him...
Yes, sir, but I can get him...
Forget it, son.
No reply on any circuits... It's drifting on a point twenty-seven skew. It's not close enough to identify.
Alert squad five, but hold them until we know what it is.

Send one squad up.
We don't get many visitors. Let's take a look at it.
Send out a boarding party. Full assault gear.
Put that thing away or you're going to get us all killed.
Yes, your highness. I'll let you open it then. It won't be too long before they figure out what happened to us. This has turned into a brilliant escape!
Yes, your highness. I'll let you open it then. It won't be too long before they figure out what happened to us. This has turned into a brilliant escape!
It could be worse...
Here come six more... grid two!
Was this trip really necessary?
There are only three or four left.
Chewbacca, it's time we showed them this isn't the regulation F8-88 Cargo Trawler.
All the data banks in Artoo are still secure.
Then I think we're due the reward you offered... and it had better be substantial after what we've been through.

The plans and specifications to a battle station with enough fire power to destroy an entire system... Our only hope in destroying it is to find its weakness, which we will determine from the data I stored in Artoo.

We captured the plans in a raid on the Imperial shipyards, but we fell under attack before I could get the data to safety, so I hid it in this Artoo unit and sent him off.

Where are you taking us now anyway?

The fourth moon of Yavin. I've given the coordinates to Chewbacca.
The fourth moon of Yavin. I've given the coordinates to Chewbacca.
I'd better go see how he's doing.
I don't see how we're going to find anything out here. This terrain is hopeless.
Did it occur to you they might find us?
We must hurry to the base. We have little time before the Death Star arrives.
I'd like to get paid before that eventually. I don't plan to stick around for the fireworks.
What about us? Are we to wait forever? Is our reward to be blown to bits on this forsaken system, while your fleet mounts some suicidal attack on that Death Star? Part of my reward is that I be around to spend it.
I have little time for your mercenary concerns, but I am grateful for the service you have given to our cause. What is your price?
Organa Major is a rebel system. There will be quite a few starfleet patrols between here and there... It could be a little tricky if you want to avoid them... ten thousand.
That's pretty steep. We'd like to talk it over first.
You got yourself a ship. We can leave as soon as you're ready.
We have a little business to take care of first, but it shouldn't take long. We'll be back shortly.
Who's the pilot?
It's automatic.
I'd keep that thing close just in case, if I were you... I've been around from one end of the galaxy to the other and believe me this Force of Others stuff may make for good religion, but there is no substitute for a good weapon at your side.
You don't believe in the Force?
You don't believe in the Force?
Sorcery! I believe in myself... I determine my destiny, not some mystical energy field.
I found it... It's just not there.
What are you saying?
You can't! We've come this far. We must find them...
Why?
Maybe you should just drop us off. I'm sure we can find someone willing to take the risk.
All right, all right! You've got a ship! But where do we go from here? They probably took her to find the hidden bases... I don't see how we can find the rebels before she breaks. The Empire has already beat us out.
No, it's impossible... No one, and I mean no one would venture anywhere near the Alderaan system... I'm a free booter, not revolutionary. You're aboard the wrong ship, son!
Maybe the fact that no one would go there voluntarily could help us. They probably don't think anyone would dare try.

Don't you believe it.
Well, I practice a lot...
You're good with 'remotes,' but how are you against something living?
You're good with 'remotes,' but how are you against something living?
I don't know... I've never fought anyone.
Between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, the entire city is going to know we're here.
Good! I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around.
This isn't going to work.
Why didn't you say so before.
Why didn't you say so before.
I think I did.
Something has happened to them. Let's try this way...
Let's try this way! Holy Maker.
Let's try this way! Holy Maker.
See Threepio, come in, See Threepio. I wonder where they are?? See Threepio...
I think she's going to be all right.
Not if this tunnel deadends.
Is he afraid of the water?
No, he smells something... but we haven't time to worry about it now.
Watch it! Move back.
Get Chewbacca. Try to get around it. I'll draw it away.
It's only light that doesn't affect it. Solid things, like rocks, can hurt it! Fire above him!
Move out of the way!
Get to the ship!
Come back here... Where are you going?
I don't pick up any life form concentration down there. She'd better be right.
They must be shielded somehow. I'm sure the base is there.
They must be shielded somehow. I'm sure the base is there.
Well, if it's not, we'll be facing that Death Star all by our lonesome.
You're a good pilot... I've learned a lot from you... I wish you...
I know, but the chances for survival here just aren't great enough in my book. I've got what I came for. Now I've got to get back to my ship.
I noticed you were having some problems, Blue Five... I thought I'd help.
Thanks, old buddy. I'll be with you in a second.
A Wookiee broke loose up here, but we've subdued him... There is a lot of damage, and three, no four, casualties...
We'll send a squad up.
We'll send a squad up.
No need, everything's under control.

The... ah door's jammed. Give us a few minutes to get it fixed.
Who is this? What's your operating...
Enough! I already know about the data you've intercepted, but its' too late. Whatever information you've gathered will be destroyed... You will come to know such suffering as only the Master of the Bogan Force can provide...
You'll get no information from me. You have no authority... the council can't hold me!
You'll get no information from me. You have no authority... the council can't hold me!
It appears your ship had an accident. I will see to it that your death is duely reported. There will be no one to save you this time.
The 'Death Star' has become operational. There is no force in the universe that can stop us now.
They'll find its weakness.
They'll find its weakness.
It's too late... We already tested it on Organa Major. It appears your data never got through.
No!...
It would be much easier if you were to tell us where the outposts are... Otherwise we'll be forced to destroy every suspicious system... What a waste...
What is it? What's going on? Where are we?
You're safe. We've come to get you out of here... Just relax.
I am Luke Starkiller at your service.
There'll be time for that later. Now let's get out of here.
Are there medical facilities on Yavin?
He'll be well cared for.
And you?
I... I don't know. I guess I never thought about it... I just want to help. I want to be in on the attack. I want my own ship.
I... I don't know. I guess I never thought about it... I just want to help. I want to be in on the attack. I want my own ship.
If you're as good a pilot as you are a swordsman... We're the ones who have been rewarded.
First thing tomorrow morning you're going to check those condensing units on the south ridge.
I will, but I'll have enough time to transmit my application first.

You used my savings! You stole my savings. If my father were here...
Your father's dead. Don't ever forget who's taking care of you, giving you food, giving you shelter, and giving you the allowance in the first place. If you plan to work at the academy the way you work around here, you won't last very long. I don't want another word. Finish your dinner, then finish cleaning those 'droids.'
Not unless you could get me into the military academy at Anchorhead.
I'm sorry, sir, I'm only a 'droid,' and not very knowledgeable of such things... not on this system anyway. As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which system we're on.
I'm sorry, sir, I'm only a 'droid,' and not very knowledgeable of such things... not on this system anyway. As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which system we're on.

That's all right. There is nothing anyone can do about it. You can call me Luke.
Thank you, sir. I'm See Threepio, Human Cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo Detoo.
There's a lot of carbon scoring here. It looks like you boys have seen a lot of action...
Indeed, sir, sometimes I'm amazed we're in as good shape as we are, what with the rebellion and all...
You've been in the Counter Wars?... Against the Empire?
That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning...
That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning...

Tell me where you've been. I am going to become a startrooper and fight in the wars. My father was a Jedi! Were you in many battles?
Several, I think. There is not much to tell. I'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories, not at making them interesting anyway...
According to my father's tapes, this is the spot where General Kenobi lives, but the instruments just don't match up with the landscape... There is no doubt about it, we're lost...
If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I don't see how anyone could live in this forsaken place.
If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I don't see how anyone could live in this forsaken place.
Well, I don't know what to do now. We'll just have to head inland and see if we can't find a settlement.
What happened? I'm sorry, sir, I must have taken a bad step...
Can you stand? We've got to get out of here before those Tuskens come back.
Can you stand? We've got to get out of here before those Tuskens come back.
I can't make it. You go on, master Luke. It doesn't make sense for you to risk yourself on my account. I'm done for.
I can't make it. You go on, master Luke. It doesn't make sense for you to risk yourself on my account. I'm done for.
No, you're not. What kind of talk is that...
I think we're going to need them. Blast it!
Sir, I have a couple of extra circuits. Perhaps they might bring something.
Sir, I have a couple of extra circuits. Perhaps they might bring something.
Well, ask him. Tell him we need five thousand.
Let him have it. You're winning anyway. It doesn't make any difference.
I know, sir, but it's the principle of the thing.
Level five, Detention block A-23, cell 2187. She's still alive...
Send feed-back into the control sensors in that Detention block.
See Threepio... do you copy?
I read you sir.
I read you sir.
You're back. What happened? Never mind. What's going on?
You're back. What happened? Never mind. What's going on?
I'm afraid we're not plugged in at the moment, sir. We've had some problems.

Good. We're right above you. Stand by.
Wait a minute, slow down!... That's better. They're where? They what? They are? Oh, no! We're going to be mashed into conduit before this is over...
See Threepio! Do you copy?
Holy Maker, Threepio. I forgot...
Are you there, sir? We're going...
Are you there, sir? We're going...
Threepio! Shut down all garbage mashers on your level... Do you copy?? Threepio, shut down all garbage...
Thank you, sir. Your kindness is greatly appreciated, but if it's at all possible, Artoo and I would like to remain in your service.
I'd consider it an honor.
You got some guts for a rich kid. I guess you and me could be buddies.
What an honor...
What an honor...
Hey, don't laugh. Everyone oughta have a friend like me !
What makes you think... you'll make... squad leader, Rico ?
Something... I've got...you don't.
Something... I've got...you don't.
You rich kids... are all the same !
You rich kids... are all the same !
It isn't about rich... It's about who's best...!

Oh, yeah ? I don't see anyone else here with the chops to lead.
Oh, yeah ? I don't see anyone else here with the chops to lead.
Well, maybe you better look again.
Our love will grow, dear, year by year...
Bye ! Write me ! I'm gonna kill you guys !
Funny how they always want to be your friends after they kick your guts out.
It's what I deserve.
It's what I deserve.
Whad'ya talkin about ?

I joined up for her. I wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for her. I'm a fool.
I joined up for her. I wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for her. I'm a fool.
You made squad leader on your own, and, hey, you still got me to kick around.
I say we all go to the laser parlor and get cut together.
What do I want with a scar ?
No, this hurts.
YAAAAAAAA !
Mobile Infantery rules !
Death to all bugs !
Lieutenant's bought the farm. Where's the Sarge...?
I didn't see him !
Dizzy says you two knew this Rasczak character in Buenos Aires...
He was our teacher... He was great.
He was our teacher... He was great.
Yeah, well, I hear he's a real nutbuster.
No way. Big K taught me I ain't executive material.
What about it, Diz ?
Jeez, we musta killed a million already...!
Not enough, I guess.
We got reinforced. Most of'em just got outa boot...
We're the old men, Ace.
We'll take this high ground. Lookouts there and therte and up there. If the bugs come upstairs in this neighbor-hood, we'll be the first to know.
Got it. Fleet tactical wants to know where they can deploy the skimmers.

Down there on the flats, eh ? Listen up, Roughnecks ! Our primary objective is to assist our friends from the Fleet...
Mr. Barcalow, save power, don't waste it on workers... Ace, tell Aardvark we're on our way...
Yes, sir !
Saddle up, Roughnecks !
You heard the Lieutenant ! On the bounce, troopers !
Rico, did you give the recruit permission to remove his helmet ?
Sir, yes, sir. Breckinridge reported a helmet malfunction, and I asked him to show it to me, sir.
Sir, yes, sir. Breckinridge reported a helmet malfunction, and I asked him to show it to me, sir.

Then why did you order your man to remove his helmet during a live fire exercise ?
Then why did you order your man to remove his helmet during a live fire exercise ?
Sir, I needed everyone in my squad operational, sir... I... I wanted to win, sir.
Do you freely admit to the charges made against you ?
Sir... I guess I do, sir.
Sir, I wish to reconsider my request to drop out, sir.
Sorry, son. I can't do it. You signed the 1240/A. It would be illegal.
Sorry, son. I can't do it. You signed the 1240/A. It would be illegal.
Sir, i know it was wrong. I didn't learn from one mistake and I made another, sir. Sir, my family... my whole family was in Buenos Aires, sir.
You still haven't kissed her yet ? Don't lie.
What's the hurry ?
What's the hurry ?
Others are waiting.
Did you read her mind ?
Don't have to... Some mating semaphore is pretty hard to miss.
Yeah, but I want Carmen.
You got it bad.
Don't think about it... go on instinct.
Ace of spades.
Statistically speaking you should've accidentally guessed right by know.
In addition to "psychic dolt" this test also proves I'm unlucky ? Two of hearts.
How do you make him do that ?
I gave him the impression that there was a fly crawling up my mom's leg. He is going to go eat it.
Ten of clubs. You still gonna sign up for Starside R&D ?
Passport to the Universe. Who wouldn't want that ?

Love... how excruciatingly pathetic. Now try and pay attention.
I don't believe it !
I got Games & Theory.
Please continue, Sergeant.
Dizzy wouldn't want our tears. She'd want us to remember her... with a vengeance. So go out and kill a bug for Dizzy. Kill as many as you can. You are her revenge, and every bug you kill honors her death.
Johnny, I'm sorry it had to be your unit on Planet P. That mission had a very low survival probability...
Bugs laid a trap, didn't they ?
Bugs laid a trap, didn't they ?
Elegant proof of intelligence, isn't it ? We thought there might be a brain on P.
You don't approve. Well, too bad. We're in this for the species, boys and girls. It's simple numbers, they have more, and everyday I have to make decisions that send hundreds of people like you to their deaths.
Didn't they tell you, Colonel ? That's what cap troopres are good for.
Hope you're ready for more. We're going back to P to capture that Brain.
The Roughnecks are always ready, sir.
The Roughnecks are always ready, sir.
I hear they need a new Lieutenant... Want the job ?
I hear they need a new Lieutenant... Want the job ?
I'll take it... until I get killed or you find someone better.
You always told me you couldn't do human...
I can't... but like I told you, it's a number's game. The Federation needs all the pilots it can get...
Are you alright ?
I'm getting better.
So what are you doing later ?
Everyone is going to the dance. Aren't you ?
Everyone is going to the dance. Aren't you ?
I don't know. It's my last night as acivilian. I ship out for Tereshkova tomorrow.
I'm all ears.
Don't you have to finish the game ?
Johnny, this is Zander.
Yeah, we know each other from the game. No hard feeling, eh, chum ?
Hey ! What are you doing here ?
I'm the guy who's gonna teach you to fly this crate.
Assistant insructor... You must be some kind of a hot stick. Should I call you "sir" ?
Only when I give you an order.
It's amazing, us running into each other like this. Maybe it's fate.
Maybe not. I heard about this crazy girl coming through the academy, solid math, a little wild on the stick, but a natural. When it turned out it was you, I made sure we'd run into each other...
In simulation, my supervisors could never keep up.
This isn't simulation anymore. Take'er out easy, cadet.
This isn't simulation anymore. Take'er out easy, cadet.

Twenty-five by five, roll seven. And don't exceed port speed.
Or...?
They revoke our flight status.
They revoke our flight status.
Oh, I see... teamwork.
Thanks. You read my mind. Third watch always seems to last forever.
Oh, I don't know... Depends on who you are spending it with.
Profile's wrong... there.
No, I replotted the course. It's more efficient this way.

Don't change the subject. Am I right ?

Me, too... Day and Night-Cycle.
WHERE IS IT ?
THERE ! GRAVITY FIELD... IT'S BIG !
THERE ! GRAVITY FIELD... IT'S BIG !
It looks like an... asteroid.
Everything coposetic, Lieutenant ?
Zander, you remember Johnny ? Zander and I are a flight team now.
Johnny, wait...
Forget it, Carmen. The Mobile Infantery does a thankless, dirty job, so they naturally tend to be short-tempered, thoughtless and rude.
Let's disregaed rank... Everybody hear that ? Rank is not an issue here.
Zander, please... Let's go !
I was thinking. Maybe we should get married, Carmen.
You weren't thinking...you were dreaming !

So ?
So ?
So who's got time to get married ?
Fleet encourages marriages among flight officers. You'd probably get a promotion out of it.
Funny...
Funny...
I'm not kidding. Marriage is -
I'm not kidding. Marriage is -
No, funny there's almost no wounded at all.
No, funny there's almost no wounded at all.
Hey, bugs don't take prisoners.
Carmen...?
Excuse me...!
I'm sorry, Carmen.
Please, I... Everybody's lost someone by now. This shouldn't be any different...
No, I... Oh, Zander, I'm a fool.
You're upset, that's alright.
Where are you going ?
A funeral.
A funeral.
That girl who died on the way up ...his girl ?

It wasn't luck. Rico ignored the mission objective to rescue you...

Zander, what are you doing ?
Just giving you something to remember me by, baby.

Zander, no...!
Good for you.
Your turn...
She's flying starships !
Who ?
Who ?
Marco's sister. Can you imagine maneuvering half a million tons through crwoded space lanes... You gotta have nerves of steel ! Reflexes are critical

I have good reflexes.
Eeuch !
Aw, c'mon, it's just a bug.
Well, if that's the crop, that must be the gastric caecal...
Excuse me...!
35% on the math final ! No one could be that dumb with numbers.
Well, at least you didn't lose your lunch over a bug. How embarassing.

Johnny, my Dad's home today.
What's he got against me... I mean, I 'm a teenager. You can't be a citizen when you're only a teenager !
It's not you, Johnny. Your parents are rich they don't need to be citizens, and that stuff means a lot to my dad. He's a veteran.

Sometimes I do what I want, eh ?
Isn't it great to be in love ?
How do I know if this is love ?
How do I know if this is love ?
It wouldn't be so romantic if we weren't...
Romance is just a vestigial biological response to procreation...
Aw, you're in love with me... You just dont know it yet.
Wait, I want to talk to Mr. Rasczak.
I'll meet you outside.
None at all... We won.
Good luck at the academy.
He just got accepted to the Fleet Academy. Isn't that great ?
Yeah, sure, I guess.
Yeah, sure, I guess.
No, I mean if he can get in, maybe I have a chance.

I can't help it.
I can't help it.
He's nothing like you.
He's nothing like you.
I don't even know if you're my girl.
Are you the boy for me ?
I'm gonna do it, Carmen. I'm gonna sign up for Federal Service.
Everyone's looking... we shouldn't...
Who cares ?
Who cares ?
You're right. Let's never stop...
I love you, Carmen.
Shhh...
I wonder where Carl is. You don't suppose...?
Naw, I made it, Carl made it.
He was in the group with me. I guess he didn't...
Shhh ! Don't make him feel worse.
Hey, Carl, what's wrong ?
Did you get Starside R&D ?
Games & Theory ? That's Military Intelligence... Oh, Carl !
Whoa ! Way to go, boy-yo !
Let's all make a vow. Let's swear we'll always be friends no matter what.
I'll go for that.
You're late.
My Dad had to help me pack. Suddenly he's afraid he's never gonna see me again or something. It was sweet, but it took forever. Anyway, I guess I'm ready to go.
Poor boy. I'm sorry your parents were so mad.
Who cares ! The Federation'll give me everything I need for the next two years, right ?
You talk to Carl ?
He left this morning. He couldn't say where.
I'm gonna miss you.
I'll miss you, too, Johnny.
I'll miss you, too, Johnny.
I love you.
Com'on, just say it. Try it on for size.
Alright, I love you.
Do you mean it ?
I said it. Isn't that enough ? Don't forget to write !
Shhhh...!
I'm glad you're doing so well. If they haven't made you squad leader by now, I'm sure you will.
What happened to your hair ?
What do you think ? Everyone did it when we got our wings. You don't like it, do you ?
What do you think ? Everyone did it when we got our wings. You don't like it, do you ?
It's alright, I guess. You hear from anyone made it out of B.A. alive ?
It's funny. Sometimes I forget. Then it hits me, and I can't stop crying.
I try just to be happy I'm still alive.

Should I be ?

Johnny... Life is so different from the way it was. One day you'll see what I did was best for both of us.
What's wrong with you ?
Hey, it's just a vestigal response to procreation... bitch.
Johnny...! I thought you were dead !
I'm not, but alot of my soldiers are. Glass the planet !

Take care, wilya Johnny ?

Thank you, ma'am.
Plasma, ma'am... from the planet.
Bug Batteries... According to Military Intelligence, it'll be random and light. Drop status ?
Where's Lieutenant Barcalow ?
He requested a combat assignment. There's always a need for experienced pilots on the ground. I had no choice but to let him go... He said you'd understand.
This is Rodger Young, we're going down... Repeat, this is Rodger Young, we're going down...!
Ibanez...LET'S GO !
Leave me, Lieutenant ! That's an order !
No way, ma'am !
Steady as she goes, number one. Prepare for warp. Number two, design for Jupiter orbit.
Yes, ma'am. Star drive in three... two... one...

Captain, we are in the path of an unidentified object moving at near light speed...
Where'd it come from ?
Trajectory indicates it came out of the Arachnid Quarantine Zone.

You take the stroll down Washout Lane, you're only proving one thing, Johnny.
What's that, Diz ?
What's that, Diz ?
That you don't have what it takes to be acitizen !

I said no. Want me to pull rank ?
I said no. Want me to pull rank ?
Well, excuse me, sir...
Hey, Diz...

Planet P ? What kind of name is that ?
They ran out of names a long time ago in this part of the galaxy.
Diz, see what you can do.
I'm on it !
What frequency ?
All bands.
All bands.
Roughneck patrol to battle group... Roughneck patrol to battle group...
I bought the farm, didn't I, Johnny ?
No, you're gonna be alright, Diz !
No, you're gonna be alright, Diz !
It's alright 'cause I got to have you, Johnny...
Johnny, people get hurt... people get killed in the Federal Service. If something happened to you I don't know what I would do...
Who gave you this idea ? It's that teacher. What's his name ? You know the one I mean.
Good good, then it's all settled.
A year at Harvard and you'll see this "Federal Service" is just menial training for inferior people so they can call themselves "citizens" and take airs for the rest of their lives.
Why did you go and do that ? He was all ready to go Zegema Beach !
Teenagers !
...CUT OFF !
Johnny, why won't you change your mind ? Does citizenship mean so much to you ?
Don't talk like that. Get yourself home as fast as you can.
We'll all have dinner. I'll fix your favorite.
We'll all have dinner. I'll fix your favorite.
Yeah ! We'll talk it out and have a good glass of wine ... and... well, we love you, son.
Oh, my, what's that ?
Looks like rain.
Looks like rain.
This time of the year...?
This came for you today. I presume on your request.
A lot of my friends are doing Federal Service...
Have you lost you lost your mind ? I'd rather take ten lashes in Public Square than see you ruin your life.
It's aterm of service, not a career. I just want to get out on my own and see the Galaxy for a couple of years.
Mr. Rasczak.
Rasczak... Silly name. There ought to be a law against using a school as a recruiting station !

Oh, is that how it is ?
A trip to the Outer Rings. Whad'ya think of that ?
Wow ! Santori and Zegema Beach, I've always wanted to go there.
Wait a minute ! Carl is doing his Federal and he isn't inferior. He's the smartest kid at school !
Sorry. Carl's a fine boy...
You'll resign, and that's all there is to it. It might look bad, but if that's the worst you suffer...
I won't quit !
I won't quit !
I'm telling you, you will ! You're not going back. You're going to go on vacation !
I'm telling you, you will ! You're not going back. You're going to go on vacation !
I'm not going on vacation ! I want to be acitizen ! It's my decision. I made it.
Well, it's just good to hear from you. What's up, son ?
It's not really working out for me here, dad. I was thinking... I was hoping it would be alright if I came home.
We must be right over the colony. Let's get some air support, eh ?
Yes, sir ! Fleet, this is Roughneck patrol, over ...?
Corporal, I want pulse cannons there and there ! Rifle teams, spread out along the ridge ! Sugar, bring up that flame thrower !
Fleet's pulling the battle group back to safe distance... They'd like us to knock out those batteries, sir.
Fleet's pulling the battle group back to safe distance... They'd like us to knock out those batteries, sir.
They'd rather spend our lives than risk their ships. Who's got the nuke ?
I don't understand it, Lieutenant. It's not getting anything from 4th Brigade... not even their transponder.
Keep trying, Sergeant.
Gillespie, put in call for retrieval. We're off this rock. Gillespie, do you read me ?
AAAAAAAAAAA !
At 0821 we received a distress call from Planet P, priority code, requesting reinforcement...
I thought 4th brigade cleaned out P.

Sounds more like some idiot at Military Intelligence Command wants to get me and my cap troopers killed...
Take your group down to P and have a look see. Leave the thinking to us, Lieutenant. That's not your job.
My job is to protect the lives of my soldiers so they can kill bugs, Major, and if you're walking me into a trap-
My job is to protect the lives of my soldiers so they can kill bugs, Major, and if you're walking me into a trap-
Bugs don't lay traps... They aren't intelligent ! Unlike you, they're stupid enough to follow orders !
Seeing as how we're about all that's left of 1st Brigade, you'd have to call that an improvement. You top kick ?
Are you kidding ? They always get killed. You want the job ?
Are you kidding ? They always get killed. You want the job ?
I wouldn't mind.
I always wanted to go to Zegema Beach.
Good luck. It's not there anymore.
You knew the Lieutenant before the war... What was he like ?
He was a teacher , kind of a know it all... Always had this little smile.

Sir, thank you, sir !
Sir, thank you, sir !
Don't stand there dumb... GO !
The Marauder power suit will prevent serious injury, but if you are hit, you will be non-operational and your team score will suffer accordingly. Rico, has each member of your squad completed a weapons safety check ?
Sir, yes, sir !
Is that your signature, Rico ?
Sir, yes it is, sir.
Sir, yes it is, sir.
Doesn't look like it to me.
No talking please. I'm going to ask you some questions. Please answer all questions truthfully. We'll know if you don't. Birthplace ?
Here in Buenos Aires.
Are your parents currently citizens ?
No, sir.
No, sir.
Which do you think is more important, courage or confidence ?

Please complete this sentence. I want to be citizen because...
I want to be a citizen because... well, because of my girl, sir.
Who said you could grow up so fast ? Last time I checked you were only five years old. You had such a bright little face...
Aw, don't get mushy.
Wait you two. Dad and I have a surprise for you that will settle this. Can you guess what it is ?
Uh, no.
I don't know what they teach at Harvard, but I think I'm pretty good enough the way I am !
Johnny, please. Calm yourself.
Johnny, please. Calm yourself.
Well, that's what you're saying ! You're saying that I'm not good enough the way I am now !
Well, yeah, sure...
I hope so. I hope you don't ruin your life over some silly little girl who wants to look handsome in a uniform.
Hello... Oh, Johnny...!
Hi, mom.
Hi, mom.
Bill... pick up... it's Johnny ! You little rat. You haven't called, you haven't written. It's been so lonely here without you...
Well, of course you should come home immedietly !
I've made a mess of things. I've been so stupid...
Don't get any ideas. She's my girl.
You can never be sure.
Best in the Fleet !
I get it. This is the part that's best for both of us. Don't do me anymore favors, eh ?
You got something to say about the Mobile Infantery ?
You heard me. Wanna make something out of it, private ?
You heard me. Wanna make something out of it, private ?
Not with an officer, no, sir. The M.I. doesn't mint stupid cap troopers.
On whose authority, Corporal ?
This would be mine, sir. Acting Sergeant John Rico. I've assumed command on this mission.
You're standing on my H.Q., Lieutenant !

You heard the Sky Marshall... Move it all down -
Rodger Young, prepare to receice outgoing fire...! I'll take the first group.
Saddle up, boys, that's our trash !
What's your problem now, Lieutenant ?
The Rodger Young just burned up...
We're outa here. Lieutenant, get your men into the skimmers. This real estate's about to go buggy.
Hey, just calm down, I'm giving the orders here-
What do you think you're doing ?
I'm gonna save Carmen.
I'm gonna save Carmen.
That would mean a comlete disregard for the mission objective. They hang you for that, Rico.

Yeah, that's right.
Let's go.
Move out.
Can you walk ?
Not a problem.
Not a problem.
Let's get some armor on her, and the we'll get outa this stinkin bug hole !
How bad are you, pal ?
Been better, buddy.
Alright, we're gonna carry you...
Nah, I figureyou folks oughta get upstairs before it's too late... Gimmee the nuke.
Don't be a hero...
This is my farm. Now c'mon, give me what you got and get out of here...
This is Rodger Young... What's going on down there ? We're taking plasma ! We have Orion P-11 as clear !
SHUT UP, SIR ! We need pick up now !

You. Tell me the moral difference, if any, between the citizen and the civilian ?
The difference lies in the field of civic virtue. A citizen accepts personal responsibility for the safety of the body politic, of which he is a member, defending it, if need be, with his life. The civilian does not.

Figuring things out for yourself is the only freedom anyone really has. Use that freedom. Make your own choice, Rico.
Where'd you learn to do that, soldier ?
Uni High Tigers, sir. Don't you remember ? I was captain of the team.

I'm not interested in nostalgia, Rico, I need a corporal. You're it until you're dead or I find someone better.
All dead except one, sir.
Kill the bitch.
Kill the bitch.
Yes, sir.
Yopu asked me some advice once, Rico. Want some now ?
Yes, sir...
Yes, sir...
Never pass up a good thing, eh ?
Corporal, the Roughnecks are moving out for Planet P immediately. Get yourself squared away and report to Gillespie for logistics.
Yes, sir !
Yes, sir !
Who's that with you ?
Rico, you're acting Sergeant now. My last Sergeant lost the com pack. Put together a search team and find the radio shack. We need retrieval.
Yes, sir.
What's that look like to you, Rico ?
Looks like a bug was in his brain, sir.
Warm it all up ! Everything you got ! Levy, collect the big guns from the towers. Watkins, put General Owen with the wounded. Rico, where's my communications ?
What's going on, Diz ?
Sergeant, secure the boat !
Yes, sir !
AAAAAAAAAAAA !
Cover us, Ace !
Hit your jets, sir !
I can't My legs are gone... Get on the boat...
Rico, tell'em to glass this goddam planet. I've never seen so many bugs upstairs at the same time...
We're not leaving you here, sir !
This is my farm. Get on the boat, NOW ! That's an order, Sergeant.
Give'em hell, sir !
Who is...'V'ger'...?
V'ger is that which programmed me.
V'ger is that which programmed me.
Is V'ger the Captain of the alien vessel?
Where is Lt. Ilia?
That unit no longer functions. I have been given its form to more readily communicate with the carbon-based units infesting Enterprise.
Why does V'ger travel to the third planet of the solar system directly ahead?
V'ger travels to the third planet to find the Creator.
Find the Creator? <U>What</U> Creator? <U>Whose</U>...!? What does V'ger want of the 'Creator'... ?
To join with him.
The Creator is that which created V'ger.
Who is V'ger?
Who is V'ger?
V'ger is that which seeks the Creator.
The examination is a normal function.
You may proceede.
<U>Why</U>...?!
The carbon-units infection will now be removed from the Creator's planet.
The carbon-units infection will now be removed from the Creator's planet.
<U>Why</U>?!
<U>Why</U>?!
The Creator has not answered.
The Creator has not answered.
The carbon-units are not responsible for that.
The carbon-units are not responsible for that.
You infest and control Enterprise. V'ger believes carbon-units interfere with the Creator in the same manner.
Disclose the information.
Not until V'ger withdraws the devices orbiting the third planet.
Not until V'ger withdraws the devices orbiting the third planet.
KIRK UNIT! DISCLOSE THE INFORMATION!
Kirk-unit, <U>why</U> do you not disclose information?
Because V'ger is going to destroy all the carbon units on the third planet.
Because V'ger is going to destroy all the carbon units on the third planet.
They have repressed the Creator.
They have repressed the Creator.
The information will not be disclosed.
Then V'ger must withdraw its orbiting devices.
V'ger will comply if the carbon units disclose the information.
Our data is being prepared.
<U>Answer</U>!
<U>Answer</U>!
We will answer and present <U>proof</U> of our answer when it is ready!
The crews of the previous Enterprises were also carbon units. In what way is the life form in your vessel different?
Carbon units are not true life forms... Do those images repre- sent how Enterprise has evolved into its present form?
Carbon units are not true life forms... Do those images repre- sent how Enterprise has evolved into its present form?
Yes.
Yes.
Carbon units have clearly retarded Enterprise's proper evolvement.
Carbon units have clearly retarded Enterprise's proper evolvement.
What is Enterprise's proper evolvement?
What is Enterprise's proper evolvement?
Enterprise should not require the presence of carbon units.
Enterprise would be unable to function <U>without</U> carbon units.
More data concerning this functioning is necessary before carbon units can be patterned for data storage.
What does that mean?
When my examination is complete, the carbon units will be reduced to data patterns.
Within you are memory patterns of a carbon unit. If I can help you revive these patterns; you could understand our functions better.
That is logical. You may procede.
Does V'ger object to the presence of the two carbon units?
The carbon units are of no consequence; V'ger will determine their purpose.
You said V'ger's purpose was to find and join with the Creator.
That is how V'ger will survive.
A machine...! Then it had to be programmed. By <U>whom</U>...?
By the Creator.
By the Creator.
To join, and become One with the Creator?
To join, and become One with the Creator?
To learn all that is learnable; to deliver all collected data to the Creator on the third planet. That is the programming.
As I stated, V'ger calls to the Creator.
V'ger is announcing that it has arrived, sir -- that it's ready to deliver the information it was programmed to collect...
V'ger is announcing that it has arrived, sir -- that it's ready to deliver the information it was programmed to collect...
'To learn all that is learnable.'
'To learn all that is learnable.'
It expects a return signal now, ordering it to transmit that information to the Creator.
And when V'ger melds? What will happen to you?
It will... take me from <U>you</U>...
Departure angle on viewer.
Departure angle.
It is a courier, Captain. Grade One priority. Non-belligerency confirmed.
Very well, Mr. Chekov, see to it. Viewer off.
Deck four, Captain; Officers' Quarters...!
Have a security team meet me at Deck Four main elevator!
Sir! Airlock four has been opened; a thruster suit is reported missing!
Spock...! Get a fix on his position!
Mr. Chekov, when do those devices activate?
They reach final position in... Twenty-seven minutes -- mark.
They reach final position in... Twenty-seven minutes -- mark.
Engineering...
Tractor beam strength lessening, Captain.
Mr. Scott... on my next signal.
I'm taking over the Center seat. I'm sorry, Will.
You are what...?
You are what...?
I'm replacing you as Captain of the Enterprise.
You'll stay aboard as Executive Officer... a temporary grade reduction to Commander.
-- You, personally, are assuming command?
-- You, personally, are assuming command?
Yes.
Yes.
May I ask Why?
May I ask Why?
My experience -- five years out there dealing with unknowns like this -- my familiarity with the Enterprise, this crew...
My experience -- five years out there dealing with unknowns like this -- my familiarity with the Enterprise, this crew...
Admiral, this is an almost totally new enterprise. You don't know her a tenth as well as I do.
That's why you're staying aboard. I'm sorry, Will.
No, Admiral. I don't think you are; not one damned bit. I remember when you recommended me for this command. You told me how envious you were, and if only you could find a way to get a starship command again. Well, sir, it looks like you found a way.
We'll have to replace Commander Sonak. I'd still like a Vulcan there, if possible...
None available, Captain. There's no one in fact, who's fully rated on this design.
None available, Captain. There's no one in fact, who's fully rated on this design.
You are, Mister Decker. I'm afraid you'll have to double as Science Officer.
Programming ready?
Program set for standard Warp entry, Captain...
... but I still recommend further simulation study.
Mister Decker; every minute brings that object nearer Earth! Engineering! Stand by for Warp Drive.
Explanation, Mr. Decker: Why was my phaser order countermanded?
Sir, the Enterprise redesign increases phaser power by channeling it through the main engines. When they went into anti-matter imbalance, the phasers were automatically cut off.
Then you acted properly, of course.
Thank you, sir. I'm sorry I embar- rassed you.
Thank you, sir. I'm sorry I embar- rassed you.
You saved the ship.
You saved the ship.
I'm aware of that, sir.
I'm aware of that, sir.
Stop competing with me, Decker!
Stop competing with me, Decker!
Permission to speak freely, sir?
Permission to speak freely, sir?
Granted.
Granted.
Sir, you haven't logged a single star hour in two and a half years. That, plus your unfamiliarity with the ship's design -- in my opinion, sir, seriously jeopardizes our mission.
I trust you will... nursemaid me through these difficulties, Mister?
Yes, sir, I'll do that.
If our Executive Officer has no objections...?
Of course not. I'm aware of Mister Spock's qualifications.
Of course not. I'm aware of Mister Spock's qualifications.
Mister Chekov, log Mister Spock's Starfleet commission reactivated; list him as Science Officer; both effective immediately.
Recommend defensive posture, Captain: Screens and shields.
No... ... that could also be misinter- preted as hostile, Mr. Decker. Cloud composition, Mr. Spock?
Captain, we've seen what their weapons can do. Shouldn't we take every possible precaution -- ?
Mr Decker....
I advise caution, Captain; we can't withstand another attack.
That thing is twenty hours from Earth. We know nothing about it yet.
That's precisely the point, Captain. We don't know it will do. Moving into the cloud -- at this time, is an unwarranted gamble.
How do you define <U>unwarranted</U>, <U>mister</U>?!
How do you define <U>unwarranted</U>, <U>mister</U>?!
You asked my opinion, sir.
<U>Computer off</U>!
It's taken control of the computer...!
It's taken control of the computer...!
It's running our records! Starfleet strength, Earth defenses...
The ship is under attack...! Man all defensive stations...!
Forcefields, full remaining strength...! Total reserve!
Why bring us inside? Not to destroy us; they could have done that outside.
They could have many ways of destroying things, Mr. Decker.
Captain, what's the next move?
The question is, Mr. Decker, <U>is</U> there a next move...
Well, Mr. Decker, it seems my bluff is being called.
I'm afraid our hand is pretty weak, Captain. But it's the only game in town.
, if we do not provide V'ger with certain information, we won't have twenty-two <U>seconds</U>; the plan must be implemented upon arrival.
Captain, we can't be sure that our... move... will actually save Earth.
Captain, we can't be sure that our... move... will actually save Earth.
No!
Mr. Decker... I will contact you every five minutes. Otherwise... inform Mr. Scott immediately.
Captain... I'd like to go along...
The fault is here, sir, not in the transmission. The antenna leads have been disconnected. V'ger never intended to accept a transmitted signal.
Capture God! In order to retrieve V'ger's data, the Creator has to physically come here!...
Capture God! In order to retrieve V'ger's data, the Creator has to physically come here!...
And plug the signal directly into the circuitry at this... ... point here, Captain. It should pick up even a tricorder playback.
And plug the signal directly into the circuitry at this... ... point here, Captain. It should pick up even a tricorder playback.
Enterprise, I want that signal again. Transmit!
They may have attacked only as a warning to us, Captain. To keep away.
That would presuppose a feeling, Commander... compassion. I sensed <U>no</U> emotion, only... ... pure logic.
We could have cut it off at the main computer...
This served the purpose.
Captain... this probe may be a key a key to the Aliens.
It's a programmed <U>mechanism</U>, Mr. Spock...
It's a programmed <U>mechanism</U>, Mr. Spock...
We have just seen that its body duplicates our navigator in <U>precise</U> detail. Suppose that beneath its programming, the real Ilia's memory patterns are duplicated with equal precision.
Exactly. And you did have a 'relationship' with Lieutenant Ilia, Commander.
That probe in there -- in a different form now -- is the same thing that <U>killed</U> Ilia!
Then V'ger believes the Creator to be a <U>machine</U> too.
It seems we <U>all</U> imagine God in our own image.
Forward motion, Captain...!
A tractor beam...
Mr. Spock, what would V'ger need to fulfill itself?
V'ger has begun to understand the true limits of our universe, thereby realizing the existence of other dimensions. To fulfill itself it must evolve to a higher dimension; V'ger believes this can be achieved only by joining with the Creator.
That transmitter is a vital link between V'ger and the Creator.
We have twenty-one minutes. Captain, we can still save V'ger... and ourselves.
Jim... he <U>wants</U> it.
You got the Enterprise, it's what <U>you</U> wanted. This is what I want. But, Jim... ... <U>I'm</U> the right choice for this mission.
Hello, Ilia.
Decker....!
I now the Captain meant no person- al insult.
I would never take advantage of a sexually immature species. You can assure him that's true, can't you?
Negative control from inertial lag will continue 22 point five seconds before forward velocity slows to sub-light speed.
Unidentified small object has been pulled into the wormhole with us, Captain! Directly ahead...!
Navigational deflectors inoperative...! Directional control also inoperative, Captain...!
Wormhole distortion has over- loaded main power systems...!
Was he difficult?
No more than I expected Not as difficult as this. I'm sorry...
No more than I expected Not as difficult as this. I'm sorry...
That you left? or that you didn't say 'goodbye'?
That you left? or that you didn't say 'goodbye'?
If I'd seen you again, would you have been able to say it?
If I'd seen you again, would you have been able to say it?
No.
Lieutenant Ilia reporting for duty, sir.
Welcome aboard, Lieutenant.
'Commander' Decker?
Our Exec and Science Officer...
And in you, too, Lieutenant.
My oath of celibacy is on record Captain. May I assume my duties?
Time to impact...?
Twelve seconds...!
Twelve seconds...!
Mr. Chekov, stand by on the phasers...!
Five minutes to Cloud boundary!
I stand corrected Mr. Decker. Navigator, lay in a conic section flight path into the cloud center; bring us parallel to whatever we find in there...
Mr. Spock?
Impact in fifteen seconds...
Transmit, Mr. Spock! Now!
Ten seconds....
Thirty seconds to Cloud boundary...
Opinion, Mister. Spock?
Fifteen seconds to Cloud Boundary.
Viewer, standard ahead.
I appreciate the welcome; I wish the circumstances were less critical. Epsilon Nine is monitoring the intruder; keep a channel open to them. Where is Captain Decker?
He's in Engineering, sir... He doesn't know.
Maneuvering thrusters, Mister Sulu.
Maneuvering thrusters, sir.
Maneuvering thrusters, sir.

Accelerating to Warp One, sir.
Mr. Sulu, steady as she goes.
Aye, sir.
Reduce magnification. Factor 4, Mr. Sulu.
We're already two settings below that, sir.
We're already two settings below that, sir.

One hundred kilometers...
Hold relative position here...
Viewer ahead.
Viewer ahead, sir.
Maneuvering thrusters, Mr. Sulu; ahead one third. Full sensor scan, Mr. Spock; they can't expect us <U>not</U> to look them over now!
Thrusters ahead, one third.
Hold station...!
Thrusters at station keeping...
Clear the bridge, Captain...?
That was the order, Mr. Sulu: Clear the bridge.
Admiral, I've been hoping to see you. Maybe you can get through to those thick heads in Starfleet that...
Why aren't the Enterprise transporters in operation, Mister Scott?
Why aren't the Enterprise transporters in operation, Mister Scott?
We're hoping it's only a temporary problem, Admiral...
We're hoping it's only a temporary problem, Admiral...
See that it is. Take me over, please.
Admiral, the Enterprise has just finished eighteen months redesign- ing and refitting. She needs testing, a shakedown...
Mr. Scott, there's an alien object with unbelievable destructive power less than three days away from this planet...
The crew hasn't had near enough transition time with all the new equipment. And the engines, Admiral: they've yet to be even tested at warp power. Add to that, an untried Captain...
Two and a half years as Chief of Starfleet Operations may have made me a little stale, Mr. Scott -- but I wouldn't exactly consider myself 'untried.'
We're losing the pattern...!
Starfleet, boost your matter gain; we need more signal!
Reporting as ordered, Captain.
Sit down, please.
Sir, I would appreciate Dr. McCoy absenting himself from this interview.
I want him here. Sit down!
You've reported that you felt strong thought emotions. A group of minds from a space vessel? Could you make out any plan, anything to do with Earth?
Negative, Captain. I could sense only what seemed an almost omniscient pattern of perfect logic. I can explain nothing more; I understand nothing more.
Also -- there was nothing in your report about <U>why</U> you're here.
That inquiry invades my personal life, Captain.
I still contain fragments of my human half.
And whatever you sensed out here....
And whatever you sensed out here....
... is my only hope of accomplishing what the Masters could not.
Let it drop, Bones. You are my Science Officer -- I'll expect an <U>immediate</U> report on anything further you learn or <U>sense</U> from here on.
I have accepted service here as a Starfleet officer... sir.
I have accepted service here as a Starfleet officer... sir.
I know this has been painful, Spock. For me too. Thank you.
Do <U>not</U> return scan, Mr. Spock! It may be misinterpreted as hostility!
Intruder scans emanate from the exact cloud center. Energy of a type entirely un- known to me.
Captain, I suspect there's an object at the heart of that cloud.
Mr. Decker, I will not provoke an attack, If that order isn't clear to you...
They have... they <U>have</U> been communicating with us. I sense ... <U>puzzlement</U>. Why have we not replied?
Communicated with us <U>how</U>?
It appears that our message has been understood, Captain.
Any reply from them?
The 'puzzlement' I sensed was fleeting... minor... ... as if carrying a sense of our insignificance, Captain.
Our... 'insignificance'?
We are obviously confronted by a highly advanced mentality... yet they cannot understand who we are, or what we want.
But they understood our messages; they broke off the attack.
Recommend we proceede, Captain.
Mr. Decker... ?
No vessel could generate a powerfield of this magnitude...
Instruments fluctuating, Captain. Patterns unrecognizable.
That vessel is generating a forcefield measurably greater than the radiation of the Earth's sun.
Transmit image of the Alien to Starfleet; advise we are attempting further communication.
Captain, we have been seized by a tractor beam...!
Get someone up here to take the Navigator's station...! Engineering... full emergency power!
We cannot break free, Captain. We do not have a fraction of the power necessary.
Delay that order, Scotty...! Disengage all main drive systems!
Have you been able to analyze <U>any</U> of this...?
I believe the light flares to be energy fields -- undoubtedly part of the vessel's inner mechanism. A technology so incredibly sophisticated that I cannot --
They had a pattern to follow...
... they may have followed it <U>too</U> precisely.
... they may have followed it <U>too</U> precisely.
Ilia's memory, her feelings of loyalty, friendship, obedience... might all be there.
Spock? Concerned about his chances?
I am uneasy with that being our only hope of more information.
Bridge, cancel rescue teams. Spock, what in the hell are you doing out here!
I am seeking answers, Captain.
I am seeking answers, Captain.
Answers to what, Spock? Our dilemma -- or your <U>personal</U> one?
It would appear that the atomic arrays of these crystals store information. A remarkably efficient system.
And these 'sensor-swarms' collect that data, carry it here.
And these 'sensor-swarms' collect that data, carry it here.
New crystals: they must contain the most recent data obtained --
Klingons... our Epsilon 9 station ... and Ilia!! They seem to be more than just images...
Exact patterns. The energy bolt that hit them wasn't simply a weapon -- it dematerialized them, stored them. But why?
If this is their ship's data banks, where is the crew? Or is their entire ship automated?
Captain, I do not believe there <U>is</U> a crew -- or that this is a vessel as such.
Were you right? Spock? V'ger is a living machine...?
A life form of its own; a conscious, living entity.
What should you have known?
No meaning... No hope... And, Jim, no answers...! Jim, it's looking for <U>answers</U> <U>itself</U>!
No meaning... No hope... And, Jim, no answers...! Jim, it's looking for <U>answers</U> <U>itself</U>!
What answers?
What answers?
'Is this all I am? Is there not more?'
These read as identical composition... ... however, Captain, they measure several hundred times more powerful!
High mag, Mr. Sulu!
Child...!?
Yes, Captain, a child: evolving into adulthood -- learning, searching -- instinctively needing.
The orbiting devices would be controlled from the point, then...?
Precisely.
Not for us?
No, Captain, not for us... for V'ger.
Has not, Doctor -- and now, because of what we are planning... will not...
There is no alternative.
Captain, the orbital device will not be triggered for twenty-two minutes...
The point...
The point...
The point is, Captain, <U>twenty-two</U>
V'ger plans to literally <U>meld</U> to reduce both itself and the Creator to patterns...
... and then to reassemble itself <U>combined</U> with the Creator. The most certain way of obtaining all the Creator's answers.
There's no way to know. V'ger expected it to be a machine -- some single entity. All of us here may be reduced into patterns...
That seems to be what it has planned -- to have the Creator physically present here.
Spock, we <U>were</U> its answer!
Yes, Captain. It needed our mortality, the fear of it, our struggle against it, our fears, our dreams...
Yes, Captain. It needed our mortality, the fear of it, our struggle against it, our fears, our dreams...
... and the 'foolish' emotions which drive us?

I knew where I was all the time.
Mommy? It's not Rachel's fault I ran away.
No, that's your fault. It's her fault for not watching over my precious son, as if it were her priority. Which means, the most important job.

I'm somewhere, thinking of you. And meatballs. And you know what?
Yes.

Of course, you do. Being magic. Then you know I've got a flu bug, and I turn green and barf profusely when I even think about food. So, all the more meatballs for you. But you know what.

Annabelle doesn't really want to talk to you right now.
I'm sorry I didn't mean to break your concentration. I thought it would be a nice moment to rememb...
Jackie, if I thought for one moment...
You listen carefully because I am only going to say this once. That woman has nothing more to do with my children.
I am not <u>here</u> to make it easier for you. These are <u>my</u> children. They don't want to <u>be</u> with you.
Well, maybe they would if they thought it was okay, with y...
Well, maybe they would if they thought it was okay, with y...

I'm sorry. Look, I'm not real comfortable being here, but...
I'm sorry. Look, I'm not real comfortable being here, but...
I don't recall inviting you.
I have a snoop.
I didn't need you to take the blame for me, I'm quite...
I didn't need you to take the blame for me, I'm quite...
I didn't do it for you. Believe me.
She already hates me. You've seen to that.

I need practice.
Those are <u>my</u> children you're practicing on. They deserve <u>first-</u> rate care. Every minute. Of every night. And every day.
So why did y...
I did it for her.
I have an appointment this after- noon. I need someone to take them to the park.
What? And have Federal agents jump out of the bushes with court orders? How many years do you get in this state for giving second-rate care to minors?
However many. It's not enough.
I'm already on thin ice. Yesterday, I actually thought my boss was going to fire me.

Fine, forget it.
Bandaids for cuts. Bandaids for new shoe blisters. Packet of Wash n Dri's. Kleenex. Sugar free lollipops, potty seat covers for public restrooms...
Why not just bring the whole toilet?

Do you have a word limit you need to hit every day or can I finish?
Sorry I'm late, I got lost dropping Ben off at Kevin's.
It's okay, it's twenty minutes. The horse'll be there.
I'm sorry, I just...

Jackie?
Jackie?
Yes?
Yes?
When I twisted hair like this it means I'm intimidated by you...
You feeling all right?
Not great. Plus, I've got things on my mind. You know.
...thinking of going back to Random House. On a part-time basis.
Wowie. How wonderful!
...make some trips into the city. Sometimes, overnight.
Hey, any help you need, we'll cover.
Uh. Have you told Luke and the ki...
Let's...hold up for a bit. It may not happen. Our secret, okay?
I don't know wh...
I was looking for Annabelle's book, and I found your tickets. And the note. From your new boss.
My boss.
You're not working at Random House, I talked to them.
You're not working at Random House, I talked to them.
You WHAT?
You WHAT?
You're taking the kids. And moving to San Francisco.
Look, you've never liked me...
Don't flatter yourself.
Don't flatter yourself.
And I know checking into your life was inexcusable...
And I know checking into your life was inexcusable...
Nobody likes a snoop.
Nobody likes a snoop.
But I came here to...
Bi-coastal parenting. Happens every day. Luke gets the kids every other summer, every other holiday, it's not ideal, but people make it work, and...
We can't live like that.
Did I hear the word...
Luke. Can't live like that.
Then let him talks to me. We don't need you to solve our prob...
...it's my problem, too.
I got used to...thinking of them. As...my kids too.
Really. By what right? Six months of part-time screw-ups?
Life's a trade-off. You get cancer, your hair falls out, but you <u>do</u> get to smoke dope.
You're not dying.
You bet you are.
How the hell would you know?
How the hell would you know?
I don't, but...
I don't, but...
How would you know <u>anything</u>?
And cigarettes. I smoke, too.
You are <u>marrying</u> the <u>greatest</u> guy who walks this <u>earth</u>. Who I have <u>loved</u> from my <u>heart</u> for twelve<u>years</u>!
They came out of my <u>body</u>!
See, I know that.
See, I know that.
I have given them more<u>love</u> and more <u>care</u> every fifteen <u>minutes</u> of their lives, than you could manage in the next fifty <u>years</u>!
Okay, I'm undeserving.
Ironic, huh?
Small world.
Luke's depo ran late. I promised I'd take notes.
So I have to tell you something in confidence...
You're a cross-dresser.
You're a cross-dresser.
That. And. Annabelle is over her head. With Brad 'The Dreamboat' Kovitsky.
She hasn't mentioned this.
She was afraid you'd make a big deal out of it.
Moi?
Toi. They've been 'going out' for two weeks.
As you may know, 'going out' in the six grade doesn't mean shit. They don't actually <u>go</u> to a movie or anywhere, they don't even eat lunch together, it's just a declaration to the world that they're...
...going out, yeh. I had kids of my own, once.
...going out, yeh. I had kids of my own, once.
Anyway. He walks up to her on lunch yard today. And tells her... publicly...that they're 'breaking up.'
Oh, my God.
Right. Which is the whole <u>point</u> of this 'going out' thing, so one of them can dump the other one, and they can imitate the whole passionate adult soap opera tragedy, without ever having to actually date.

She's devastated.
She's devastated.
Doesn't <u>begin</u> to describe it. I mean, you've got cancer, <u>this</u> is serious.
And you said...?
Beats me. Ask your mom.
Can I look at the pictures?
It's a mess, right now. That's my project when I get back.
So. Hopeful.
It's promising, this one. We're upbeat.
I really look like shit.
You look sick. But you look... together. Mentally tough.
You look sick. But you look... together. Mentally tough.
Yeh, that's bull. I'm going for serene, they say some actually get there.
You try to center on the big issues, y'know. What it's all about. What this whole trip has meant. But then, the <u>really</u> big issues keep swamping y...
Brad Kovitsky.
The primo stuff is great for pain.
I think my 'primo shit' got left in my 'bellbottoms.'
He's relentless. A <u>major</u> asshole.
And you said...
And you said...
What else? Keep on keepin' on.
Eat your heart out. Is Annabelle there?
Yeh, she's...I'll get you Ben first, it's past his bedti...
Yeh, she's...I'll get you Ben first, it's past his bedti...
How's she doing with Brad?
Can I say one thing? I mean, the <u>last</u> thing I want to do is inter- fere on the Brad thing, b...
Thanks, but it's under control.
Yah? Well, even the best mom in the world, the smartest, the wisest, whatever. Needs to know when to find a Plan B. Cos Plan A <u>is</u> not and <u>will</u> n...
It's <u>covered</u>, okay? I appreciate your concern. Can I talk to her?
Hon, maybe your mom would like t...
...go to the park. In the worst way.
I'm thinking. Do I know you well enough to really chew you out?
No.
It's just not the right time t...
Do what you've worked your whole life to do?

It was just a job, there'll be plenty of others.

You mean, after I'm dead?
Hey, you haven't quit on you, I'm sure as hell not gonna. I just mean, I'm juggling a lot right n...
Juggle it! Move the darkroom into your house. You've got that room downstairs with the treadmill Luke never uses anyway. Don't lose your confidence. Don't lose your edge.
Juggle it! Move the darkroom into your house. You've got that room downstairs with the treadmill Luke never uses anyway. Don't lose your confidence. Don't lose your edge.
It's the same choice you made.
It's the same choice you made.
Yes. I made the choice that was right for me. And I don't regret it. But even for me, there were days when I felt so lost, so invis- ible. And then I'd hate myself for the kids not being enough.
I know you, huh? The car pools, he measles, the PTA. It's not gonna be enough for you in the long run. You have to think long term.
I just want to spend time with them when I'm not rushing or on the phone or tired or...
I just want to spend time with them when I'm not rushing or on the phone or tired or...
That's motherhood. That's the job, with or without a career. I'm telling you the biggest gift you can give them is your happiness. They <u>need</u> you to be happy.
My advice to you? Don't die.
Feeling the pressure?
Somehow, his blanket always looked like a cape, even the nurse said that. He <u>loves</u> to hear that story, over and over. How he was born a magician.
And her...?
And her...?
Took 28 hours. She just wasn't sure about entering this world.
That thing you said before. Pushing the guy sleeping next to you away. Because of what you gave up for motherhood...
Is that what he told you?
Is that what he told you?
He won't discuss it. Just calls it history.
You really didn't have to come, you know. I'd have brought them straight t...
Who in the world <u>is</u> he?
Looks nice enough to m...
He looks familiar. Did he do a Calvin Klein ad?
Now we're going to have a fight, you and I.
Are we.
Are we.
And I'm going to win.
And I'm going to win.
Don't be too sure.
Now, 'limp dick', I know. What. Is 'snowballing'?

Give 'em my number.
Actually. They'll want Annabelle's mother.
Is that what you're worried about? Looking bad at the PTA?
Is that what you're worried about? Looking bad at the PTA?
You are <u>defending</u> what you did?
You are <u>defending</u> what you did?
Right down to the ground. Let's get to it.
You put filth in my child's mouth.
Aw.
Aw.
You had her <u>lie</u> about that... that fancy-boy <u>model</u>!

Worked. Like a charm.
She was beaten, and bloodied, and it was going to go on, uni...
So you became the hero. And I became the schmuck.
You taught my child that I am some limp dick <u>loser</u>. Who didn't <u>care</u> about her pain.
That's not wh...
That's not wh...
You think <u>I</u> didn't have some dirty words for that little putz? You think <u>I</u> couldn't figure out some low blows?
You think <u>I</u> didn't have some dirty words for that little putz? You think <u>I</u> couldn't figure out some low blows?
You weren't passing 'em out.
You weren't passing 'em out.
Well, maybe <u>your</u> version of growing up is 'Just win, baby'.
See, in that crisis, I saw an opportunity. For some <u>real</u> growth.
Oh please.
Oh please.
Shut the fuck up. <u>I</u> didn't go behind <u>your</u> back.
Doing the <u>right</u> thing. Knowing who you <u>are</u>, inside. Not <u>caving</u> to peer pressure, or <u>lowering</u> yourself to that level, <u>steering</u> your <u>own</u> course...
She wasn't steering her own course, she was steering <u>yours</u>.
She wasn't steering her own course, she was steering <u>yours</u>.
Well, that's what parenting is <u>about</u>, little girl. They are <u>pleading</u> to know how they are supposed to do it. And you sure as hell <u>showed</u> her.
And there will come <u>another</u> moment. When the stakes are <u>really</u> there. And she will look back on this. And remember how good it felt. How easy it was.
And she'll fight back again. God help me, what have I done.
You've turned her into you. And I may not get another chance. To turn her back.
<u>That's</u> what it is. And that's <u>all</u> it is.
Thanks for coming out.
Neutral ground. What's up?
She likes a Stolie, no ice.
Double.
What's this about? Because we <u>fought</u>?
Don't flatter yourself. I always liked that line.
I love Luke, I love the children. But there is more to life than even love...
No, there isn't.
No, there isn't.
And I have looked down the road. At what my life will be. And I can't handle it.
I never wanted to be a mom. Then, sharing it with you was one thing. Carrying it alone, the rest of my life...
Is scary. But you want it. Gimme some truth here.
Well, it's the Jack Kennedy Syndrome, huh? You die young, you always look golden. Perfect. The memory kind of burnishes the image, and...
Come on, a wuss like me? The stiff who wouldn't help her own daughter fight back?
Come on, a wuss like me? The stiff who wouldn't help her own daughter fight back?
Maybe I was wrong on that one.
You're lying.
I lost him. I was panicked.

I was running around like a chicken with my head chopped off. Doing my imitation of you.
Ben never mentioned it.
He only remembers I <u>found</u> him. My point is, telling you this story would have been the kindest, most helpful thing I could ever have done for you.
Why didn't I?
Uh. You hate my guts?
With good reason. They fucking worship you as it is.
What do I have that you don't?

'...the kids have camp. Their friends are here. Over there, I'll just be shopping in a language I don't even know. My life, and the kids' lives, aren't here to service your mid-life crisis.' Did it go like that?
She called it a fight. <u>The</u> fight.
What do you call it? You told her you had doubts.
Can we go sit somewhere?
Let me put it this way. Hell, no.
I told her I loved her.
By way of saying you were unhappy.

Restless.
Restless.
Excuse me. 'Things are so confusing for me, Jack. Our life feels too comfortable, too safe, too predict- able. It's a partnership, it's juggling schedules. When I think of playing that out, every day, for the rest of my life...'
'...I don't know if I can make it.' That's what I said. But I didn't leave.
No, she threw you out. What a difficult woman.
That's a pretty ugly thing you just said.
No, here's ugly. 'I love <u>you</u>, babe. It's just our <u>life</u> together I'm not so sure about...'
'But keep dancing, and if you're lucky, I might just never leave, who knows?'
That's not us.
That's not us.
Because you've changed so much.
We make our lives, one step at a time. We do the best we can. The truth about the future? A promise. Is only a hope.
How about the promises we make to our kids? About <u>their</u> future. Do we shrug those off, just that easily?
Where you goin'?
I'm gonna get me a drink.

Why was he on Death Row?
Why was he on Death Row?
For rape and murder.
Consuelo, what is rape exactly?
It is when you love someone, and they don't love you. And then you do something about it.
Sometimes I feel like my parents don't love me.
Well then, when you get older you can do something about it.
So whaddya think?
Well, I'm not really sure what you're trying to say. It's funny, I suppose. But it seems glib and facile to just make fun of how idiotic these people are.

The camerawork's nice.
Thanks. I'll tell Mike. Well, it's still just a beginning. I know I can...dig deeper.
This is definitely better.
You think so? You don't think that this might not be a little dry?
You think so? You don't think that this might not be a little dry?
This is entertainment you're making, Toby. This story about a kid in the suburbs and the state of the college admissions process has, with this Brady crisis, evolved into something much richer and more provocative.

OK, you're right, you're right You know, we need to screen what we've got invite some regular people, just some random off-the- street types and see what real people think of this.

I was looking through Scooby's SATs practice books this afternoon and I took one of the practice tests. Guess what score I got?
What?
What?
550 verbal, 520 math. And I'm only in fifth grade!
Steak's really good tonight. SCOOBY Good.
Got a lot of homework?
Marty...
You started filling out your college applications yet?
Not to be crass, but what do we get out of this?
Don't worry, he doesn't mean money.
We used pull.
You know, you have to. Sometimes you just have to, Toby.
It's all about who you know.
Look, we're not suckers. Everyone else is out there doing the same thing.
Look, we're not suckers. Everyone else is out there doing the same thing.
He's right.
Sure!...
Of course, honey. Come in bed with us. Come on.
Was anyone in my room today?
Is everything OK?
Is everything OK?
My CD case like totally collapsed. I'm gonna have to recatalogue all weekend. Hey. Can you pass the salad over.
What are you going to do?
I dunno.
We did the same thing last year also.
How was the class?
Well...yes. If it hadn't been for Hitler, he wouldn't have had to leave Europe. We would have been...European.
But then, in a sense, since you would never have met Dad if your family had stayed in Europe...if it weren't for Hitler, none of us would have been born.
Hi, Scooby! How was school today?
Fine.
Fine.
Ready for tomorrow?
Ready for tomorrow?
What's tomorrow?
What's tomorrow?
The SATs, knucklehead. SCOOBY I'm not taking them.
Hey, you want to hear my short story now?

Well, actually, it's the same, but longer. I think it's better. More...raw.
Well then, maybe you should just read the ending.
Well then, maybe you should just read the ending.
But it won't make any sense if you hear it out of context.
But it won't make any sense if you hear it out of context.
I think you should leave it the way it was. It was good.
So you don't want to hear my new ending?
You'll read it in class tomorrow. Surprise me. Anyway, I have to go. I promised Melinda I'd help her with her oral.
You're tired of me. I can tell.
Marcus, I'm tired. That's all.
Marcus, I'm tired. That's all.
You've lost interest...You hardly even sweat any more when we have sex.

I was never much of a sweater. You know that.
Look, Vi, I don't blame you. You feel You feel pity now. The pleasure isn't there any more. The kinkiness has gone...You've become kind.

Your story was terrible!
Marcus...You'll write something better next time!
Patronizing fuck! If you had just been honest with me in the first place I wouldn't have read it. I knew it was shit. But - idiot! - I believed you!
Patronizing fuck! If you had just been honest with me in the first place I wouldn't have read it. I knew it was shit. But - idiot! - I believed you!
That's not fair! I was honest! Just because I wasn't sucking up like that bitch Catherine.

Well, I sure didn't hear you voice your opinion in there when it mattered.
Well, I sure didn't hear you voice your opinion in there when it mattered.
I admit it - I was scared! I was shocked, in fact , by what he said. And he's so...convincing. I'm sorry if I let you down, but really, I still say he's just one opinion. I don't even like his books that much. They're all so aggressively confrontational. I don't care if he's won the Pulitzer Prize.
Which is it? You gotta keep your focus straight.
You're absolutely right. The focus is on the college admissions process today.
And you want Scooby to be the focus of all this?
Scooby and a few other students of different socioeconomic backgrounds.
Scooby and a few other students of different socioeconomic backgrounds.
Oh, well, I don't have them yet, but 
Reconceive.
'Cause Scooby does have a quality that I've been looking for, a quality that is emblematic of American today. It's part disillusionment, part hope...
Oh, I know, I know that. Well, sharing your story, your ups and downs, and so forth, can I hope, be an illuminating experience.
Yeah...How do we know we won't be exploited?
But what kind of pull did you have?
I have a cousin. Very big giver to the alumni fund.
I think Scooby's like a lot of kids. He just hit a a speed bump. Now he's gonna find his way, his path is gonna be cleared, and I think he's gonna continue his education at a good college. And everybody else is gonna be happy.
...But Mr Livingston, aren't you a bit fearful that Scooby will be confronted with hollow values and systemic conformism?
Fuck!
I'm going in there.
I dunno.
Whaddya mean you don't know? You either got a lot or you don't. What's not to know?
What DO you know?
Dad, I'm trying to figure things out right now, OK? It's like, really hard, and I'm just listening to some old Elton John and...
So? How was school today?
The same.
The same.
The same. Same as what?
The same. Same as what?
Just the same.
Get the hell outta here!
Man, it's just, like, conversation.
Scooby?
Yeah?
Yeah?
We have to talk.
Whaddya wanna talk about?
Don't screw around with me. You know what I'm talking about. You're taking those SATs. You're taking those SATs or your CD collection is history. You're taking those SATs and you're going to college. You're taking those SATs if I have to strap your ass to a chair, but buddy your taking them.
OK.
Tired of this shit...
I just want to know what the hell he's doing in his room that's so interesting he doesn't come down for dinner.
Maybe he's building a bomb...just like-!
Mom, it's not fair if Brady can say the f-word and I can't.
Yeah, well, Mikey, listen up. Cause here's a lesson: life's not fair.
Dad? Do you think that Brady will ever get better?
One in a million recover.
One in a million recover.
Maybe he's that one in a million!
Maybe he's that one in a million!
Mikey, there's optimism, and then there's stupidity. It's a very fine line.
I don't think there's any hope, either. I was just trying to make you feel better.
Thanks.
Thanks.
You're welcome. Dad? Would you let me try hypnotizing you now?
You're welcome. Dad? Would you let me try hypnotizing you now?
Yeah. Sure Go ahead. Hypnotize me.

Come here, give me a hug!
Gee, you're home early!

He's a very stubborn man sometimes...
You should listen your old man more often. He's got principles.
What do you mean?
After Leizburg, he stuck his neck out to defend me. He's loyal to the end. Even if it's not--politically correct at the time.

Let me tell you something Cooper! I never once bad-mouthed him during all those months--
Let me tell you something Cooper! I never once bad-mouthed him during all those months--
No but you didn't defend him either! Didn't want to rock the boat. Guess the ride was too smooth. FILMORE I was acting under legal counsel!
Cooper...
Yeah?...
I drew my gun, ran in the direction of the cries...violating the first rule of service...I let the Ambass- ador out of my sight.
What happened?
What happened?
By the time I got back to the party our ambassador was face-down, in a bed of bloody azaleas.
You're a lot like my father, Cooper... you think with your heart.
Used to Filmore, used to.
Now what?
There's the fence...
I'm going first. Taking the fire. If we go out together we're all dead!
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
They probably have guards on the roof--and they're gonna be firing at me--not you! ATKINS What makes you so sure?
They probably have guards on the roof--and they're gonna be firing at me--not you! ATKINS What makes you so sure?
Because I'll be firing at them.
Because I'll be firing at them.
You're talking about committing suicide!
What about rule one: never let the person you are protecting out of your sight!
Rule two: without alternative, use yourself as a shield.
Well Filmore--
Well Cooper...
Well Cooper...
Looks like you're not going to make that dinner after all...

I guess not Cooper...
I have a lighter!
Even better.
How well do you know this place?
We're on sublevel six. We'll pass some labs and then we'll hit the stairwell--

I don't see why they wouldn't be.

Good...
How's the arm?
It's nothing to worry about.

We wouldn't have made it out without you. FILMORE Or without you.
That's it! Up ahead!
Where does it lead?

The maintenance hatch--it takes us outside the building!
Enjoying the tour so far?
Are you going to kill us?
Are you going to kill us?
I don't know. If you gave me a reason to...
Go fuck yourself...
Hey now! No cussing on TV! Well in closing I'd like to say that there are two reasons to have that money outside in an hour. One is my perky co-anchor here, and the second is the lives of tens of thousands of people--people just like you and me!
I hope you don't mind all this--it's just that the networks will eat it up, you know...
You're going to pay for this...
You're going to pay for this...
You got it all backwards, Helen--but that's OK, you work for the government...
You understand that they're watching our every move right now--you think you're just going to sail away?
It seems to me we are just sailing away. They haven't sunk us yet, have they? Besides, don't you worry your pretty little head about that. It's all been taken care of.
I know you're not too happy at this point. It's too bad we weren't able to meet elsewhere, under different circumstances...
Like where--in your dreams?
I suppose...you think I should thank you.
Yes, you should.
You see, it paid off--you broke away from the old guard, congresswoman. It won't be long till they're calling you Senator Filmore--
Shut up!
Come on, drink up.
I don't want any...
I don't want any...
I insist...
I insist...
I said I don't want any, goddammit!
Came over the satellite. We're keeping the bird clear should they call back.
She's still alive.

The transmission is an hour old...
Well?
We've prohibited the networks from broadcasting the transmissions.

We have a special forces squadron out of Thailand surrounding the compound as we speak.
Why the hell didn't you tell us this was at stake!
Chemco's been developing nerve gas?
What about Cooper--where is he?
He's in there...
Looks like Richter isn't acting alone--he's heading into some dangerous waters.
She's as good as gone...
She's as good as gone...
You can't think like that! We're watching them like a hawk--he's bound to trip up, make one false move--
This was taken when Richter was arrested in Washington state, 1985. He was charged with interstate arms trafficking, skipped bail, and has since been a fugitive.
Chemco is willing to deal with him, meet his demands. I can have the money there in an hour.
And--of course there is the human cost, which is incalculable.
I'm sure you'll figure it out.
Who's Ryan Cooper?
I'll let the senator tell you.
And what exactly do they intend to do?
The ball is in Richter's court. But we're sure as hell not going to sit on our hands while he assassinates people--we're gonna stop the son-of- a-bitch!

I don't think you--grasp--the situation, Mr. Myers.
So, what are we looking at White?
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
What do they have in there that's so valuable? A cure for AIDS, a cure for cancer?

I assure you gentlemen if we had something of that magnitude it wouldn't be shelved in a lab somewhere...

Mister Myers it is a chemical plant! There are a number of volatile compounds-- but they are safely stored away...
Chemco makes many things senator! We were under government contract!
I haven't been briefed on any such thing!

Apparently, this project is--unique. But it's heavily protected--all formulas are heavily codified!

Well, it's a binary formula--a precise amount of two separate chemicals must be exposed to the nitrogen in the atmosphere simultaneously for it to work.

How much do they have?
He wouldn't take it on the helicopters. He'd transport it through pipelines that connect Chemco to the waterfront...
What!
What!
They were probably topping off a docked tanker while he stalled for time--without anyone being the wiser...
How goes the roll call?
We're secured. Takeover team is in position and accounted for.
Have you broken it yet? We've got six more heads and that means six more hours.
I'm in to the directory but they've codified the stockpile--numerically.
Of course it's codified! Each number probably corresponds to a compound. Have them pull every compound from the lab and compare it to the codes till you figure it out--that's what you're here for.
I know what I'm here for-you don't need to remind me.
Something tells me you don't want to be on TV, friend.
Richter-we got a problem!
KZ...7-0...7-0...nine. It checks out.
Excellent...excellent!
