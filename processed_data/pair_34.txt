You've got to eat something. You're just nervous about going over to see if you're Diane Selwyn.
Is everything all right? Is it bad for you that I'm here?
Everything is A-okay, but I've gotta get that sandwich!
I hope I'm back in a couple of hours. Don't drink all the coke.
Good luck!
Good luck!
When I get back I'll have the cab waiting, so be ready to go.

Okay.
Why didn't you ask him? Sol knows you!
But I don't know, Sol. I never heard of Sol. I'd just get in trouble. That's why we shouldn't go see about Diane Selwyn... it's better not to get in trouble.

He hired you to build this place ?
He hired you to build this place ?
I was hired in and started to do the boring old work routine. I was originally brought in as a technical advisor. First Bank had sponsored my scholarships.
I was lured by all the money and I truly did convince myself that what I did was for justice. Since then, McCay has wanted to put anyone he can down here.
But how do you know if the people are guilty ?
But how do you know if the people are guilty ?
I do a very thorough background check. I go through police files, personel files, anything.

What do you mean ?
What do you mean ?
McCay had a lot money done into researching psychological reactions to questions that are seemingly unrelated, but reveal everything. Like criminal impulses, homicidal impulses.....
And you believe that ?
I've since changed my mind. I designed this place, based on my belief that I was doing what the legal system couldn't or wouldn't do. McCay had the company buy the property and they pay the bills. It's a tax write off. On the books everything looks kosher. I have an office on 5th that I haven't seen in ten years.

Doesn't anyone notice all the people missing ?

This is New York. No one notices anyone. Not even when someone disappears. At first it was the guy who was caught trying to steal McCay's Jag. Then it was dirty accountants that tried to walk away with millions. The Old Man got such a rush from it, I thought that he would start trying to send me people who used the copier after

So was I. So don't give me any shit. Your business is just as bad. At least I'm up front about it. You kill people slowly. Your corporate take overs can decimate a families livelihood over a year sometimes two. Now you know how it feels.
Just remember, hold your breath as long as you can. Then go right over to that corner. The door will open and go in and up.
Okay.

It's poison gas, this is the antidote. Drink it.
Do you know where you're going ?
Yes.
What was that ?
Girder, watch your head.
What about you ?
There's one more person here for me to visit.
Just stop it. End it here.
It'll end. It'll end with him and McCay. Then the park shuts down. Permanently.
What are you DOING here ?
I work here, remember ?
I work here, remember ?
That was eleven years ago.

Trust me, if you open any door, you'll be dead a whole lot sooner.
Okay, NOW I'm worried. What exactly is on the other side of the door ?
Either you'll be shot with bullets, impaled with a large spike, or nailed like a super model. Basically you're fucked any way you go.

And that's different than this because...... ?
Hey buddy, thanks for the help back there !
I don't help criminals.
Give me one good reason why I don't plug you right here, right now ?
Because of my charming personality ?
Is it over ?
Not quite....
That's nice. I think I lost my wallet.
I'd get out of the water if I were you.
I'd get out of the water if I were you.
Why ?
I thought you made this place ?
I did, but this room has four exits and only one opens, it's up to them in the control room. There's one right over there. The exit light is on, but he can change it.
What's next Walt ?
A dragon.
A dragon.
So what happened ? Did you have a real bad theme park experience as a kid and this is your revenge ?
Be very, very quiet...
Are you hunting wabbits ?
The room has sound sensors. If you wake it up, it breathes fire.
You were one of those guys that played Dungeons & Dragons with real swords, weren't you.
An elevator ?
Yeah, we're about a hundred an fifty feet below the subway stations. We're heading a little higher up now.

Hey, try swimming. It works.
What the fuck are you talking about.

Swimming, you know, like in water, moron.

Knock yourself out.
Knock yourself out.
Thanks...

Well, I kinda just blurted it out over a root beer float.
She was talented, but honey I wish I could help you a little more, it's just that your mother and I had kind of a whirlwind courtship, she came to town with this traveling theater group, I proposed on our second date, two weeks later we were married and almost nine months later you were here and she was gone.
Was it a nice funeral?
Was it a nice funeral?
Oh yes, lovely funeral, Gernaldi brothers did a beautiful job, lots of pink roses...I used the white hearse. Hey, how about this flowered wallpaper for your room?

What does that mean?
It means...I'm a paranoid nitwit who's never let his baby girl out of his sight for the simple reason he's a paranoid nitwit. So why don't you just say &quot;Oh Dad&quot; and get on the damn plane already?

Well Rose was being very thorough.
Was Rose.
Doctor Helburn, what a surprise. In the last couple of days we've changed your oil, realigned your brakes, balanced and rotated your tires, aligned your front end, and flushed out your entire cooling system, I really didn't expect to be seeing you for another three thousand miles.
Oh what can I say Phil, it's just that I feel so welcome here.
Okay, that does it, that does it, the strudel does it, first it's brakes then.... I mean I am not gonna let some Podiatrist with a Jaguar full of strudel come waltzing in here and....
I'm not a Podiatrist, I'm a Cardiologist.
I'm not a Podiatrist, I'm a Cardiologist.
Who cares? Rose, tell him we have an arrangement.

Dating, seriously dating. You're thirsty, want something to drink? Sure you do, it's been a long trip.

I had to be, I only have five days. So just point me in the right direction and....
I'll do better than that. I'll send you off with your own private guide.

Do you think I should tell my dad about Jeffrey Pommeroy?
I don't know, he's got an awful lot on his mind right now.
Maybe.
Then again, your dad's got his own memories and he's got his own life now...I think this is a secret just between you and your mom.

Then you'll be all set.
Sounds like you're very organized.
No, there's no problem, Dr. Helburn just needs to have his oil changed.
Oh I see, 'cause usually that doesn't require such a lengthy consultation.
What's with the touching, why was he touching you?
He wasn't touching me he was just...gesturing...

After my wife died, Grammoo moved in here to help take care of Vada. They were very close, but lately as her mind's been wandering more and more, Vada's been acting kinda crazy. I'm sure she'll snap out of it though.

No, I'm going home.
Why? It's not dinner time yet.
Why? It's not dinner time yet.
Dinner time?? You're like a dog! You just go home to eat.
It doesn't work, it always stays black.
It's only black when you're around 'cause you put me in a bad mood.
She's crazy, she wants to go to school over the summer.
It's not a real school, it's a writing class, I wanna be a writer.
It's not a real school, it's a writing class, I wanna be a writer.
She only wants to do it because her sweetie pie's the teacher.
Maybe they had a big breakfast.
I'm gonna be an acrobat when I grow up.

Oh, in the garage. Walk me over.
Hey look at this!
That was Grammoo's. It's a phrenology chart, they used to study the bumps in your head to see if you had a good personality or not. Come here, i'll diagnose your head.

I think, everybody gets their own white horse, and all they do is ride and eat marshmallows all day, and everybody's best friends with everybody else, when you play sports, there's no teams, so nobody gets picked last.

Why are you running away?
My Dad gave Shelly a ring.

Okay, seeya.
Oh, that's probably Thomas J, I don't wanna see him. It's not fair. Nothing happens to boys.
Hi Vada, can you come out?
Hi Vada, can you come out?
I dunno..

Please, it's real hot, maybe we can go swimming?
Well when you get older, you just have to.
I'm gonna marry Mr. Bixler.

You can't marry a teacher, it's against the law.

Would you think of me?
Would you think of me?
For what?
For what?
Well if you don't get to marry Mr. Bixler.
Yeah, it's in the contract.
Well, then, I'll take it up with her.
... trouser width, this is all classic. Which means safe, something I'd wear.
I should look different.
I should look different.
You should look like you dressed yourself.
And I'm supposed to respect your fashion tips, because you're what, a New Yorker?
Something like that.
Long trip. Pretty nice of you to come.
Well, I'm close to her. I wanted to meet the one that got away.
What?
I'm just glad someone finally put this thing in its proper perspective.
Stay, huh?
I honestly wish I could...
I honestly wish I could...
I'll call George's parents. Tell them I need a best man who actually looks after me.
You don't miss much.
Part of being a New Yorker.
Is it ever embarrassing, having your bum kissed in public?
If your ass isn't chapped, you are not a good-writer of note.
Is it sad to be an editor, and bask only in reflected insincerity?
I've adjusted, and thanks for asking.
See the pull of a book like Twenty Chefs, is not who I put in. It's who I leave out.
Which is everyone you couldn't get in.
Which is everyone you couldn't get in.
Plus some guys whose food I don't like.

Is Newsday a real interview, or just some cute guy you're setting me up w...
... I don't send you men, anymore. You don't know what to do with them.
Sometimes I do. Like for two months.
... weeks.
No, no, the opposite. That's my best friend, Michael O'Neal. He sounds desperate to talk.
The wandering sportswriter.
Nine years, we've seen each other through everything. Losing jobs, losing parents, losing lovers... travelled all over, we've had the best times. The best times of my life, maybe. Just drinking and talking. Even over a phone.
Kindred spirits.
Kindred spirits.
No, he's nothing like me. He's like you. Only straight.
He's the salt of the earth. Kind and loyal and generous. The one constant thing in my life, is he'll always be there.
He's still in love with you.
Whenever George tells someone how steadfast I am, he always makes me sound boring.
Solid and genuine is not boring. Michael can be completely insane...
I've lost interest.
He takes a razor from his dinky little dopp kit, cuts his fingertip, takes my hand, does the same to me...
Blood oath.
He says, "Swear. When we're both 28, if we've never been married... we marry each other!"
You think...
Desperate. To talk.
He's not proposing marriage, there's no way I'm buying one word of th...
Then why are you compulsively eating? If you're not hysterical?
He can't do that to me!
We're about to find out.
We'll never be the same.
I have a suggestion...
I have a suggestion...
I'll have to kill myself before I call him.
You have no appropriate sense of emergency. My best friend is ruining his life.
No, he's ruining yours.
No, he's ruining yours.
Same difference. If you love someone, it's your duty to save them from themselves.
Same difference. If you love someone, it's your duty to save them from themselves.
You have a real philosophy of life.
You have a real philosophy of life.
It's called the Law of Love, asshole.
He's adored me for nine goddamn years.
I can see why.
I can see why.
She knows him maybe five seconds, plus she has billions of dollars, plus she's perfect, so don't go feeling sorry for Miss Pre-Teen Illinois!

I noticed. I'm on the noon back. We have this thing with George's family in the Hamptons.
You're butting in.
What I mean, when I say annoyingly perfect, is that there is nothing annoying about her perfection. It is vulnerable and endearing. And that is annoying as shit.
You like her.
You like her.
If I didn't have to hate her, I'd adore her.
I was devastated.
Go figure you.
Go figure you.
Because I realized. When I see him say "I do," that knife will be in my heart. And it will be there every...
There are 18,250 nights in the next 50 years...
You've been working on this, huh?
You've been working on this, huh?
... and having "done the right thing" will only really be comforting, oh, maybe, five, six times.
This is my whole life's happiness. I have to be ruthless.
And you believe that.
And you believe that.
Sure.
He was in love with me every day for nine years. I can make him happier than she can.
It's not his happiness you're feeling guilty about...
It's not his happiness you're feeling guilty about...
I don't know the meaning of the word guilt!
I don't know the meaning of the word guilt!

I am breaking her heart in the short run, but doing her a gigantic favor! She would be miserable tagging along after this insensitive doofus!

DON'T BE RIDICULOUS, WE'RE HAVING A SERIOUS CONVERSATION!
I give.
I can't even say it.
How do you know you can touch that plug? Are you a licensed contractor?
What do you suggest?
I suppose it's too late to start over.
It's too late to start over.
Two words.

You're going to say it, aren't you?
Tell him you love him. With all your heart.

Needing.
Needing.
To belong to someone.
Tell him you know this is the worst, dumbest, cruelest moment to do this to him. But there it is, and he has to choose.
And what will he do?
Digger and George are with family in the Hamptons until Monday morning. Brevity is even more in order than usual.
Hey, handsome. Brevity this...
I did what I came to do.
Good girl.
I'll think about it. I'm okay.
Oh, you're more than okay.
All I've heard, from the day I met Michael, is Julianne this, and Julianne that...
Well, we're...
Well, we're...
I think the best part of marrying this guy is finding you.
My heart's in my throat, here. Right off, I have to ask this monstrous favor...
You need a few dollars.
Excuse me?
I can be quick. I can even be funny.
But I can't be dry.
Can you watch the road?
Can you watch the road?
See. Dry. It's in the delivery.
This is a very presumptuous and burdensome fav...
... you want a menage on your wedding night.
You can't believe what it'd cost to bring in a temp.
Uh. How about promoting a bridesmaid? Someone you know for at least forty-five minutes.
The bridesmaids are my only two female relatives under forty. Identical twin debutantes from Nashville, who are basically vengeful sluts. With amazing bodies!
Which was the disqualifying factor?
Which was the disqualifying factor?
The twin part. I like to remain impartial in my contempt.
I thought bridesmaids had to wear the same dress.
Not you. You won't be comfortable unless you're distinctive.
What else did he tell you...
... you hate weddings, you never go.
That's why Michael and I were the wrong fit. Right from the start.
He said that, too.
Don't you have to be somewh...
... just my bridal shower. And Michael has to meet our dads and the groomsmen at Comiskey for a one-thirty game.
... luckiest guy in the Northern Fucking Hemisphere, is all I'm s...
What? Because I'm a little understand...
What? Because I'm a little understand...
... most sentimental schmucks I pity want a honeymoon after their wedding. Just to top it off.
I'm excited Sports Illustrated gave him this kind of shot, he's only there a ye...
So your honeymoon is exactly where?
It depends. If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento, we could start there. Or Phoenix. Or depending on Indiana- Clevel...
... garden sports, all. Little swing of maybe fifty degrees Fahrenheit, represents a packing challenge, but there's fine food and cocktails at a choice of Embassy Suit...
Well. You've been introduced to the symphonic range of...
... his snoring, yeah. He says it's worse than ever. That snaffle one...?
How about...
... cigars in bed? I broke him on that. But the bathroom's a swamp, he wears Reeboks to dinner, tells the same, admittedly funny, jokes three hundred times...
He sucks soup through his front teeth.
A trademark move, don't touch it.
A trademark move, don't touch it.
But he sure can kiss.
But he sure can kiss.
It's been awhile. I'll take your word.
It's been awhile. I'll take your word.
After two weeks of cataloguing all his faults, I made a command decision that changed my life.
And loving him means loving all of this.
Do you get nervous in small confined spaces?

No.
No.
And the answer was so simple.
And the answer was so simple.
I was gonna predict that.
I was gonna predict that.
You win.
You're enshrined in his heart and memory. Unassailable. Which works out great.
I've missed a step.
I've missed a step.
He has you on a pedestal. And me in his arms.
Jesus, we're trapped!
Ju...
Ju...
No, this happened to me once, almost, it was excruciating!
It's not just clubs. This guy always knows the best everything. The best guitar store, the best beef ribs, the best Horowitz record, was he always like the...

I just think you're wrong, is all.
Probably am. Forget I brought it up.
I mean, he loves his job.
Bad games, bad towns, bad pay, bad flights, bad hotels, real bad food. Homeless, rootless, lonely, maybe your copy gets into one issue out of four...
But he always says...
... whatever is manly and independent.
For the twins? What in the world is th...
Gold nose hair clippers.
Gold dog collars? They don't have dogs.
Hello.
So... one almost has to...
Exactly.
Exactly.
Exactly what?
Exactly what?
What you said. Make it appear that he's doing you the favor.
He'll see right through it.
Only. If he wants to.
In six months, he'll be happy, settled, successful...
He won't get mad, huh?
Your call. You can live a lie. In a fabulous selection of Red Roof Inns. Or you can make one desperate stab at hap...
I just don't want to freak him out.
Uh, Kimmy...?
We settled this. And I reneged. That wasn't fair.
Look at all this beautiful food, so lovingly prepared...
They'll eat it anyway, you ever been to a walk?
Who? The jerk who's running your life?
This must be... very, very, hard on him.
This must be... very, very, hard on him.
What with the psychosis and all, yeah.
When are you gonna come clean with your folks?
Don't you see...
Don't you see...
If you're waiting for "Do you take this man?", that's considered poor form.
If you're waiting for "Do you take this man?", that's considered poor form.

Yeah, well, lots of couples are imcompat...
I love him.
In one minute. You are going to feel so foolish.
WHY DON'T YOU JUST DRIVE A STAKE THROUGH MY HEART?
WHY DON'T YOU JUST DRIVE A STAKE THROUGH MY HEART?
Have you ever heard of. Irony?
I never want to go through this again.
That's entirely understandable.
Have you sized up the groomsmen, Jules? As M. of H., you get first fuck. Don't pick the short, hairy, rich one.
... unless he has a hump.
Well. See. That was a... reflex to see if it would...
... look good on Kimberly.
... look good on Kimberly.
Right. And then it didn't want to come off. Exactly.
I saw the show.
... well, maybe it works on fingers, too.
Wallace egregious residence, Mandy speaking.
It's Jules, you guys haven't had a call from, say, Kimberly, have you?
It's Jules, you guys haven't had a call from, say, Kimberly, have you?
Oh, she's slipped out, the little monkey. Prob'ly with Michael, doin' the nasty.
Ex-cuse me?
I had this crank call? From some guy who thinks he saw her? I said, what would a bride be doin', on her wedding...
I had this crank call? From some guy who thinks he saw her? I said, what would a bride be doin', on her wedding...
You are <u<so right. What a nerve on that guy! Bring my dress to church, huh?
If he gives you grief, I'll have him skillfully beaten, where the wounds won't show.
I guess getting him whacked would be politically out of the question.
I guess getting him whacked would be politically out of the question.
Under the circumstances. Charmed to know you, Jules.
Under the circumstances. Charmed to know you, Jules.
Nice meeting you, too, Walt.
They both have some growing up to do. But they're good people, they're starting with love. They've got time.
I think you're making a mistake, sir.
Is anybody watching?
I hope so. This is all too mysterious to waste on just me.
Julianne, reading my son-in-law's mail, is not something...
Sir, this is important! Haven't you ever in your life cut one corner, to make something important turn out right?
It's a fax from Sports Illustrated from Ben Isaacson, Michael's boss.
I know Ben.
I think he's been fired.
It doesn't say th...
It doesn't say th...
He's said some things over the past few weeks. Look, this is why I came up with the idea of you offering him a job.
And you think he's kept this to himself.
He's too proud to beg for help. And if you wait till this comes out, your offer will be like charity. Completely humiliating.
Maybe. I should call Ben.
Then it could all come out, sooner or later. Nobody should be in on this. Just you and me. Or, more correctly, I.
I thought Michael was picking me up.
I told him, get the important stuff, Kim's ring. I'll collect the inconsequentials.
I haven't caused... a problem, have I?
Nobody has. So far.
Well, you're a little early...
I need to make some calls. Could I use... your office?
I've been calling for days!
Yeh, well my old machine kept eating messages. I tried constructively ignoring it in hopes of improvement, but finally...
Well, that's great. You haven't really had anybody since Dingbat Jennylee...
You don't understand. I've never felt this way about anybody!
And she's all wrong for me!
Well, somet...
Well, somet...
I mean she's a junior at Chicago University, she's twenty years old! Like when I first met you.
Well, sure.
But they're so down to earth, such wonderful people...
But they're so down to earth, such wonderful people...
You've met her parents.
Michael, it's Wednesday night, you can't possibly be getting married on Su...
Actually, it all starts tomorrow. It's one of those four-day weddings, with all the traditional events, and ten million people flying in from Madagascar such.
Well, the Sox are at home. SI's letting me do a profile on the Big Hurt. That's Frank...

Well, maybe we should talk ab...
I need you.
Please come, please.
W...
W...
I can't wait for you to meet her!
What's the sec...
Mirrors.
Best everything, Joe. But I'm going to dance with you.
Dance? You don't dance! You learn to dance??
I just admire your maturity, that's all. I mean, there are people who would find that kind of perfection boring. Day after day, year after year...
... see, that's what I thought at first. How can you like someone that perfect? No potential for long-range livability.
Luckily. The closer I watched, the more the fault came into focus. Each imperfection its own adorable slice of vulnerability.
Such as.

She's too genuine.

At first, I thought it was a gag, but she's always done it!

Where was that, Florence, huh?
Firenze.
The Vespa? Me hanging on behind in the rain all night?
Till the gas ran out.
Should I whistle down a cab?
Hey, cabs are expensive. I'm cheap, remember?
Pretty amazing girl, you've got. Make that kind of sacrifice.
What, leaving school...
What, leaving school...

She would never. Never. Even think of that.
I guess you're right. That would be deceitful... manipulative... controlling... emascula...
I got the point.
Still. All's fair in love and w...
That would be a girl. I don't even know.
You're not eating.

Last zoo we were in was... Beijing, yeah? Sure. The rhinos were fucking.
Boy, those were the days.
It's weird being the groom. All these things Kimmy has to take care of...
You need a baby-sitter. That's what I'm here for.
Wow and wow. You have a date, after this?
Never can tell.
Why don't you start being honest for one fucking sec...
Michael!!
No problem. A little bullshit about Daddy's "needs," and presto, I'm a lap dog in high society.
Michael, it sounds like a wonderful opportun...
Michael, it sounds like a wonderful opportun...
Does it, really? How come you never took some sell-out establishment job? You had plenty of chances!
You guys are heartless, my bride picked this out.
Like I said, dazzling.
Big weddings are so strange.
You keep saying that.
Kim has all this stuff to do, I hardly see her.
Well, you've got the rest of your lives.
You miss her, huh?
No. I've got you.
Don't you throw up on boat?
If you like.
I've been thinking a lot the last couple days. About us, actually.
Have you.
Well. There's a lot of memories to choose from...
It's more than that.
You've sort of been... y'know, the woman in my life.
You've been the man in mine.
And I was thinking this could be our last time. Alone. Together. You know?
Except for the hot affairs we'll have twice a year.
Except for the hot affairs we'll have twice a year.
Except for that.
I can hardly wait for your wedding.
Me either.
I wouldn't know. I never had that many first thoughts.
I mean, you commit to a wedding. And then it seems like... this... momentum, you know? You forget you... chose it.
Dance card filled?
I'll check. I have it on powerbook, these days.
Where did we first hear th...
The night we met.
So we heard it... like, right that... that first...
We danced to it. Just like this.
Takes me back.
Well.
No accents today.
Yeah, Kim told me they were giving you their Dueling Scarlet's act. Actually, they're sophomores at Juilliard.
Will she like it?
Yes.
It's no big deal, she just gave you the wrong keys that's s...

Me, too. I'm getting married tomorrow.
Me, too. I'm getting married tomorrow.
That's my point!!
I forgot how cute you look. When you get impossible.
It's just... up there... right in front of Walter's... y'know, computer. If memory serves.
We could use... his computer, to... just E-mail those suckers right ou...
Tomorrow is Sunday. Nobody's doing business. Crack of dawn, Monday, Walter'll take you up there...
Listen up, huh? Even if you blow this deal, how big could it be?
You're right. Easy come, easy go.
This thing means that much to y...
It means a lot.
The fax is from Ben, too. Man, it's my wedding, and my boss can't leave me alone...
... maybe it's congratulations.
Michael? What ha...
Mike. I can't believe I'm doing this to you on the night before your wedding. But I think you need and deserve to know...
Isabelle? I need to talk to Kim...
"Mike, the funny thing is, he's offering you a gig you'd be stupid to turn down..."
"Mike, the funny thing is, he's offering you a gig you'd be stupid to turn down..."
I'm just tired. Please put her on? Thanks.
I'm just tired. Please put her on? Thanks.
"Maybe you should take the job. And dump the girl."
What happened?
It's over.
She denied it. Said I was crazy and paranoid.
A bad combination.
Michael...
No, it's for the best, it really is. We were so wrong for each other.
No, it's for the best, it really is. We were so wrong for each other.
Maybe tomorrow, you'll feel dif...
Maybe tomorrow, you'll feel dif...
The job thing would have broken us up, eventually, anyway. She couldn't have lived with it. I know that now.
Should we take a walk? Or maybe some food sent up, or something...
I just want to be alone. Is that okay?
Or we'll go somewhere. If you have the time.
If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento...
I had the craziest dream last night? Walter and Kimmy had asked your boss to...
Look, I came down here to face everybody. I didn't want to slink away like some coward...

She hasn't told anybody, what am I supposed to do?
Get married, apparently.
This is her family and her fault.
And your point?
And your point?
Well. How come she didn't...
Well. How come she didn't...
BECAUSE SHE'S AS CHICKENSHIT AS YOU ARE, YOU MORONS ARE MADE FOR EACH OTHER.
I asked you...
She admits it's her fault.
Does that make it right...
Love doesn't have to be right. It just has to be love.
Thank God you were here.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
I was so confused, so conflicted, so... unstable.
I was so confused, so conflicted, so... unstable.
Well, it happens.
... your one chance for true happiness?
... yeah, that.
... yeah, that.
You never want to do that, see, that's always a... costly turnover. As they say in the sport biz.
The Big Hurt, huh?
Nellie Fox. Walter likes the past. And he likes the little guys.
What's up?
Shhh.
Jules, what's wrong...
This is the dumbest thing I will ever do. So dumb, in fact, that I can't. I don't think.
Uh. I saw that moving...
DON'T SPEAK!
You're not saying you actually... you're saying that y...
... wrote it, yeah. I'm the bad guy.
... wrote it, yeah. I'm the bad guy.
ARE YOU CRAZY?
I mean, do you realize what you've... well, of course you realize, that's why you're confessing, I mean... I mean... how could you do that?
I didn't know it would get sent. I just wanted you to... get mad at Kimmy... and...
Actually. Lower. I am the fungus that feeds on pond scum. Lower. The layer of mucous that cruds up the fung...
Lower.

The pus that infects the mucous that cruds up the fungus.
I'm so glad you didn't jump on that train, before...
I came here, looking for her.
Why would she come here...
This is where I proposed.
I never forgot that.
It's two weeks.
It's two weeks.
Almost three.
Almost three.
That is so romantic.
You can't believe you've lost her! Sooner or later, you'll find her, and you'll look in each other's eyes, and you'll see all that love...
Course, if it's later rather than sooner, I'd hate to be you at six o'clock. You've got a lot of explaining to...
Course, if it's later rather than sooner, I'd hate to be you at six o'clock. You've got a lot of explaining to...
I'm just thinking of how she's hurting. Lost. Alone. Like her life is over.
I'm just thinking of how she's hurting. Lost. Alone. Like her life is over.
That's little egotistical.
Okay, we'll split up. You go to every romantic place you guys have, I'll go... someplace brilliant, and the first one who...
If you find her...
The kiss. May be hard. For you to explain. Because the only fear she really has, is...
... me, yeah. And she likes Tommy Lasorda. Case closed.
Well, the school will be here. Architecture will still be around. Right now...
I travel every week. College ball, motor sports, training camps...
I travel every week. College ball, motor sports, training camps...
The most important thing. Is being together.
Because I could come...
To the twins' soiree? So they can paw you and drool...?
It's not just a gag, huh?
No, it's, uh... a real big favor.
He never mentioned that. Neither did y...
... and public relations is a big problem area for him.
He needs someone incredible, someone really close, who he can trust...
Like family, huh?
It would only be, maybe, six months? Or three or four? It would mean so much to him...
To him.
And to m...
... and you knew about this.
All of a sudden, I'm supposed to drop out of school, forget my family, forget my career, forget all the plans I had for my life...
Well, forgive me for screwing up your plans!
I'm sure glad I'm hearing all this now, before it's too late!
What is that sup...
What is that sup...
And what am I supposed to do with my life, huh? I am 28 years old! I work in a low-paying, low-status, zero-respect job which, unfortunately, I happen to fucking love. How inconvenient.
What a sweet little picture. Mommy and Daddy aren't losing a daughter, they're gaining a eunuch!
Well, if that's the way you f...
Well, if that's the way you f...
Damn straight, it's how I feel! What's their wedding gift, a little gold collar that says "Mikey-poo"? Or do I have to change my name to "Binky"?

I see.

Now, Sueleen, you know that's not what we talked about right here in this very room.

When you study the martial arts, they give out belts that come in different colors to signify what level you're at in your training. Am I correct on that point?
Yes you are.
Yes you are.
What was the color of Tim's belt?

Tim studied several styles, but his favorite was Jeet Kune Do.

Jeet Kune Do...Now I did some research on that form of fighting, and I found out that Jeet Kune Do was a style developed by Bruce Lee. Did you know that?
Yes, I did. That's why Tim studied it. Because it was Bruce Lee's fighting style.
Now, while I freely admit total ignorance on the subject, I have heard of Bruce Lee. And I was under the impression that Bruce Lee was one of the, if not <u>the</u> greatest fighter in the history of martial arts.
That's what Tim said.
That's what Tim said.
So, I think it would be safe to say that anybody who studied the fighting style that Bruce Lee, arguably the greatest martial artist of all times, developed for nine years, that would be a fella who could defend himself. Would you describe Tim that way, Grace?

Yes, I would.
Point of fact, weren't Tim's hands registered as lethal weapons?
Yes, they were.
That means his hands are considered a weapon like a gun or a knife. Am I correct on that point?
Yes, you are.

Mallory, what did you think of Mickey's plan? Did you think it would work?
It wasn't 'till we got on the ground floor that I totally realized they weren't gonna shoot unless we shot first. When we got out of the stairwell, I remember thinking, 'Oh my God. This might work.' But Mickey knew it would work all along. There wasn't any doubt in his mind. It's not like there was and he just didn't show it. He

Naw, she don't mind.
Grace. I'd like to talk to you about your murdered brother Tim, if you feel up to it.
Now, when we get out there, you do what we say or it's curtains. If we say move, you move. If we say left, you move left. If we say right, you move right. If we say mole, you dig a hole. Got it?

If they wanna say we masterminded the whole
Looked like an interview to me.
I said we'd give you an interview. I never said we wouldn't kill you.
Why are Mickey and Mallory being moved to an asylum? And who made the decision?
The prison board made the decision. A board of which I belong. We're the who. The why is simple. Mickey and Mallory are mentally ill and need to be under a doctor's care, where hopefully they'll receive the help they need.

Mickey and Mallory were deemed competent in a mental examination before their trial. I'm confused. What's changed?

Well, since that time, they've killed one person during their trail. And since their incarceration, they've killed one psychologist along with several guards and inmates.
Well, since that time, they've killed one person during their trail. And since their incarceration, they've killed one psychologist along with several guards and inmates.
When they were found competent before, they had already killed fifty people. Other than the fact they're a disciplinary problem, which frankly shouldn't surprise anyone, I still don't see where this situation is any different then it was before. So, I ask you again, Mr. McClusky, what's changed?

What's changed, Mr. Gayle, is our minds. We felt they were competent a year ago. A year has passed, sir, a year where they were under close observation, day in and day out, and their behaviour has led us to believe we were wrong.

Now that you bring it up, yes. They were different men. I hadn't really thought that much about it. Since many psychiatric opinions are, by a rule, sought out for this kind of situation. What do you think normally happens? The Knoxs are assigned a family psychologist that takes care of them throughout the rest of their lives? The state doesn't work like that.
Congratulations on the Curtis Fox case, Scagnetti. You put an end to a nightmare. The ladies of this city can get to sleep again, and they have you to thank.

I can appreciate that.

Even better. Wayne call your station, tell 'em we're going live a little early today. Make it happen!
You ready, Donut?
Ready.
Ready.
Wagons, hooaaa!
Hello Mickey. We've never been introduced, but I'm Wayne Gayle. I don't know if you've ever heard of me or remember me. I was one of the reporters outside the courthouse during your trial---
Everybody knows who you are. You're famous.
The episode we did on Mickey and Mallory was one of our most popular ones.
Did you ever do one on Wayne Gacy?
Did you ever do one on Wayne Gacy?
Yes.
Yes.
Whose ratings were higher?

What I'd like to do---
What I'd like to do---
How 'bout Manson?
How 'bout Manson?
Manson beat you.
Manson beat you.
Yeah, it's pretty hard to beat the king.
Yeah, it's pretty hard to beat the king.
We've been waiting to do a follow up episode on you for a long time. And that time has definitely come. I feel it's apparent to anyone who's hip to what's going on that the prison board has thrown the constitution straight out the fuckin' window. You and Mallory may be killers, but you're not insane. You belong in a prison, not in an
My problem Mickey, is that you don't exactly inspire empathy. I'm all alone on this. I need your help. I want what the prison board is doing to be the focus of our follow up episode. Now I have interviews with chairman of the prison board Dewight McClusky about this issue. And I'm tellin' ya, Mickey, he looks bad. The two psychologists they used
Have you talked to Mallory about this?
Have you talked to Mallory about this?
She won't even see me, Mickey. Now you're not supposed to know anything about what's going on with her, but I'm gonna tell ya somethin'. Since you two've been sentenced, Mallory hasn't spoken one word.

She doesn't talk?
She doesn't talk?
Not to anybody. She sings.
Not to anybody. She sings.
She sings? What does she sing?
She sings? What does she sing?
Songs. 'He's A Rebel', 'Leader Of The Pack', 'Town Without Pity', that Dusty Springfield song 'I Only Want To Be With You'. That's what I hear anyway. Her behaviour was the main thing the doctors' report used against you. So even if she would see me, which she won't, I couldn't put her on camera anyway. If I ask her, 'Mallory, are you insane?'
Mickey, how do you feel about cross- examining Grace Mulberry?
I'm keen with anticipation.
Okay now, before we get started here, there's a few things we have to get clear about.
All right, Mickey.
All right, Mickey.
Let's discuss it when I'm unbound.
Sorry about that.
Don't worry about it.
Don't worry about it.
We're about ready to go here. Are you ready?
We're about ready to go here. Are you ready?
Let's do it.
So, Mickey, tell us what you do for fun.
Aside from the obvious?
Much obliged. What do I do for fun? Do you want to know what I do for fun or what I did for fun?
What? Oh, aaahhh, what you did for fun for starters.
What? Oh, aaahhh, what you did for fun for starters.
What I did for fun for starters. Well, something I used to do...always was a lot of fun... No, scratch that. Let me think of something else. In fact, why don't we come back to that question. Ask me something else.

Do you miss Mallory?
Do you miss Mallory?
Of course, I miss Mallory. She's my wife. I haven't seen her in a long time. What a stupid question.
Of course, I miss Mallory. She's my wife. I haven't seen her in a long time. What a stupid question.
Then was it worth it?
Then was it worth it?
Was what worth it?
Was what worth it?
Was massacring all those people worth being separated from your wife for the rest of your life?
Do you think up these questions or the girl with no tongue?
No, Mickey, I can't let you get away with that shit. Answer the question. Was it worth it? You haven't seen, heard, or smelled Mallory in a year. Was it worth it?
No, Mickey, I can't let you get away with that shit. Answer the question. Was it worth it? You haven't seen, heard, or smelled Mallory in a year. Was it worth it?
Was an instant of purity worth a lifetime lie? Yeah, it was.
Was an instant of purity worth a lifetime lie? Yeah, it was.
Excuse me, did you say an instant of purity? What was the instant of purity? The bodies you left behind on your bloody trail?
Excuse me, did you say an instant of purity? What was the instant of purity? The bodies you left behind on your bloody trail?
That's only part of it. I mean, it's a big, big, big part. But it's only the chorus, it's not the whole song.
That's only part of it. I mean, it's a big, big, big part. But it's only the chorus, it's not the whole song.
Please explain to me, Mickey, where's the purity that you couldn't live without in five year old Danny Millhouse's blown off head? Where's the purity in forty-eight people who are no longer on this planet because they met you and Mallory? What's so fucking pure about that?
You just said an instant of purity was preferrable to a lifetime lie. I don't understand. What's so pure about forty-eight dead bodies?
You'll never understand. Me and you, Wayne, we're not even the same species. I used to be you...then I evolved. From where you're standing, you're a man. From where I'm standing, you're a ape. I'm here...I'm right here... and you...you're somewhere else, man. You say why? I say why not?

Tell me about the purity.
Tell me about the purity.
It's not that easy, Wayne. Donuts and a smoke only get you so far. You're gonna have to do your job.

Okay...okay...I'll buy that. We'll move on and come back later.

Don't play dumb with me, Mickey. You know what I mean. Describe Mallory. What's up here? What's in here?
Don't play dumb with me, Mickey. You know what I mean. Describe Mallory. What's up here? What's in here?
That's indescribable.

Well, riddle me this, Batman. How do you feel about the fact that you're never gonna see Mallory again?
Well, riddle me this, Batman. How do you feel about the fact that you're never gonna see Mallory again?
Says who?
Says who?
Says the United States of America.
Says the United States of America.
When have they ever been right?
Everybody thought I'd gone crazy. The cops, my mom, everybody. But you see, they all missed the point of the story. I wasn't crazy. But when I was holding the shotgun, it all became clear. I realized for the first time my one true calling in life. I'm a natural born killer.
Okay, let's cut it.
I could go for a Coke.
Could I get a Coke for Mickey?
You guys wanna hear a joke I heard?
Sure.
Sure.
Now, I'm no comedian, but it's pretty funny. It's a Little Johnny joke. Now in the joke, Little Johnny can't talk. And Little Johnny's teenage sister asks her mother if she can go out on a date.
Donut, get your camera. See if it's broke.
Let me check on Scott. He's hurt bad.
Let me check on Scott. He's hurt bad.
Scott's dead. And unless you wanna play follow the leader, shut up and do as you're told.
Okay, we're going out that door, and we're gonna march down the hall and right out of the building. Donut said something about a news van.
Yeah, we have a van.
Yeah, we have a van.
Where's it parked?
Where's it parked?
Out front.
Out front.
Let me have the keys.
Mickey, can I talk to you alone?
No.
No.
This is crazy. You can't escape like this.
This is crazy. You can't escape like this.
Probably not, but we're gonna give it the old college try.
Probably not, but we're gonna give it the old college try.
We'll all be killed.
That's what I thought. You tell them that. When we go down those stairs, I want you to scream what you just told me. 'My name is Wayne Gayle! I am the star of American Maniacs watched every week by'-- how many people?
On average forty million.
On average forty million.
'Every week by forty million people. I am a respected journalist.' Have you won any awards?

Are you kidding? The Golden Globe, The Edward R. Murrow award...
'Respected journalist'-- On your knees...
...'Winner of the Golden Globe and the Edward R. Murrow award among others.' Tell 'em the name of your personal lawyer, his firm, his address, and phone number. Tell 'em about the mayor and the unemployment lines. You getting the idea?
Yes.
Say it. Scream it. All the way out the front door and into your van. And if you stop screaming, I swear to God I'll blow your head off.
Got it.
We ain't got all fuckin' day!
Without any further ado, Mickey and Mallory...
C'mon, c'mon, let's hurry this up.
So, what now?
Just wait one fucking minute.
I said I'd give you a interview. Now unless I'm mistaken, we just did a interview. We did an interview, didn't we?
...developed between the three of us. We're kindda in this together, don't ya think?
No. Not really.
No. Not really.
Don't touch those triggers! Please. I think I've already proven that a live Wayne Gayle is much more better that a dead...Way-- Gayle. I was your passport out of jail, not Duncan Homolka. But me! I'll be your passport outta---
Don't touch those triggers! Please. I think I've already proven that a live Wayne Gayle is much more better that a dead...Way-- Gayle. I was your passport out of jail, not Duncan Homolka. But me! I'll be your passport outta---
Just save your breath, Wayne. We hate you. If anybody in the fuckin' world deserves to die, it's you.
Wait! You can't kill me. Mickey and Mallory always leave somebody alive to tell the tale.
We are. Your camera.
Let's make a little music, Colorada.
NO!!!
I can't go. I'm too fucked up.
I'm not saying it's not gonna hurt, but--
I'm not saying it's not gonna hurt, but--
I can't run with you, Mickey! I really want to. If I could, I would, but I can't. I gotta stay here. But you can still get out of here.

Mickey, you're wasting time!
Mickey, you're wasting time!
I don't give a damn if a million United States marines, all whistling the halls of Montezuma, are gonna come marchin' down this alley any second. There ain't not fuckin' way in hell I'm leaving you. And that's that!
Yeah baby.
You made every day like kindergarten.
Yes.
Then you've seen the scene where Arnold Schwartzenegger is talking to Lou Ferigno.
Then you've seen the scene where Arnold Schwartzenegger is talking to Lou Ferigno.
Yes.
How can you say that you 'admire' them?
It's like this, Wayne. Two people are standing in a dark room waiting for the other to attack. These two people can't see each other, yet they know they're there. Now, they can either stand in the dark room forever waiting until they die of boredom, or one of them can make the first move.

Why can't they just shake hands and be friends?
Why can't they just shake hands and be friends?
They can't because neither knows if the other is a deranged senseless killer like the Knoxs. So, you may as well make the first move.

Unfortunately, yes.
I admire them.
I do, too.
Hypnotizing.
Have you seen 'Pumping Iron?'
Through the power of the simple word---
And a snake-eye glare.

Schwartzenegger was the king of the edge before they came along.
Yes.

That's the Mickey and Mallory way.
That's the way of the world.

They're shocking the world into remembering the primal law.

Survival of the fittest.
They had us tied down during one of their house raids, you've seen the headlines, and they were taking a chainsaw to our legs before they were gonna kill us.
Just for fun, I guess.

And then Mallory stops Mickey and says, 'Hey, these are the Brothers Hun.'

I'll say enough to destroy this wing.

The entire wing?

That's my opinion.

Jesus...
Drink up! This is a celebration. This is the day we received word we were gonna make television history. We're gonna have the first sit down, in depth interview with the most charismatic serial killer ever, one day before he's being shipped to a mental hospital for the rest of his life. This is one of those golden moments that happens maybe only four
This is Raymond Burr witnessing the destruction of Tokyo by Godzilla.
How immediate is immediately?
Next week's episode.
Now we got to film a new intro for the follow up episode. But we put the intro for the first episode at the beginning temporarily so you can see it with some scope.
I hear ya. Play.
You can't be serious?
I'm as serious about that as I am about going back to the donut store, and dipping that stupid Mexican's head into the batter for forgetting my chocolate cream filled. Gimme that other box.

What's the big deal? Take out my chocolate cream filled, put one of these roasted coconut---

Roger, do you understand what the word 'no' means? It's important we establish a rapport. Something as simple as a dozen donuts can mean the world to somebody who hasn't had a donut in a year.

So you're giving a man who butchers whole families, little babies included, my chocolate cream filled?
Okay, guys, we're here. L.A. County Jail. Julie, just park in the front.
Wayne---
Wayne---
Roger, I'm starting to get pissed. Just drop this fuckin' donut shit, and gather your gear.
Roger, enough with the fucking donuts! What did I tell you. Stop bothering Mickey, and get behind your nagra.
Fine. Roger, what the hell are you doing? You're bothering the serial killer.
Roger?
Rockin'!
Rockin'!
Scotty?
Pleased to meet ya, Jack. I read your book. I'm impressed. Good work on Curtis Fox.
Thanks.
What's the travelling arrangements?
Well, Mickey and Mallory can't be together. So, we'll put you on one of our prison busses and you'll take Mallory first, then you'll come back for Mickey.

Yeah. Bus is all gassed up and ready to roll.
Yeah. Bus is all gassed up and ready to roll.

Coolin' her jets in a holding cell.
Nothing for me. I'm leavin'.
Me, neither. I don't eat meat.
Jack, could you stay up here for a while?
Yeah, sure.
Yeah, sure.
I'm taking one of these men. Yates, come with me.
We got tonight and tomorrow to get our shit together. The day after that they're shippin' Mallory. That's when we do the Mickey Knox interview, 'cause the next day he goes.
Would the network really not run it without the interview?
Would the network really not run it without the interview?
Are you kidding? The last thing they expected was Mickey Knox to get up close and personal. They wanted a follow up episode and would've taken anything I had given them. I'm not gonna tell Mickey Knox that. I'm gonna make him think his grey matter depends on it. When I told Woody and the brass about this coup, they practically shit a brick.
So Unruly Julie's comin' with me and planning the interview. You two go down to the editing bay, take the old footage and the new footage, put it together, and see what we got. Get it into shape so when we finish the interview, we can just stick it in.
When do you want the assembly?
When do you want the assembly?
Tomorrow.
Okay, boys, let's have it.
Well, basically, what we did was put part of the old show on first...
Good work, my brothers. Fan-fuckin'- tastic! I think that interview stuff's too long, we can lose some of that. Keep the girls, keep the long hairs, keep the Hun brothers, keep the black guy, keep the movie shit, and keep the cop at the donut shop. Lose the rest. And cut the interview with the prison board fellow before that. Cut it after I
Okay.
How's it working, Scotty?
Perfecto!
Rollin'...and speed!
Slate it.
Camera jam! I'm sorry Wayne. God.
Fucking dammit! Mickey hold onto that thought. Reload, quick!
It's gonna be beautiful.
Super cool. This is great stuff. How ya doin'?
But how can you say that?
They're mesmerising.
But you see, that's okay, Wayne.
Why?
Why?
They passed the 'edge' along to us.
They passed the 'edge' along to us.
How so?
How so?
By taking away our legs. Now we have to fight harder to get ahead than anyone else you'll find in this gym. Probably the whole city. They gave us the fighting spirit. Before this happened I was content. Now I'm pissed off. Now I'm half a man and I've got to work like the devil to get whole again.

But you'll never be whole again.
But you'll never be whole again.
Never is a very long time, Wayne. A word only the weak use. I'm not a sore loser. Even if I don't have a leg to stand on, I'm going to get up and fight this world until I'm on top again.
Hello, Mr. Gayle. I'm Phil Wurlitzer. We talked on the phone. It's a pleasure to meet you.

That sounds great. Look, I don't want any of this to intimidate you. This is not going to be a big deal. This is going to be very easy. I need to talk with Mr. Wurlitzer. You guys get your equipment ready, power up the van and confirm a transmission code for the remote. Julie come with me.
How's everything coming, Mr. Gayle?
Everything's coming along just fine. Phil, I wanted to know if I could have a small word with you.

Is that her real name?

Just a little nickname. Yep, they're my kids and they're all I need. After working together these past coupla years, we're like well-oiled machinery. No, more like a Formula race car. No, scratch that one, too. What we're really like is a Swiss watch. Small, intricate, compact...it shouldn't work as well as it does, but it does. Because of the craftsmanship, the expertise, and

See what I mean? It's a funny business, isn't it?
It sure is.
It sure is.
They got a asshole over here. A asshole sitting down reading a magazine over there. A asshole perched up there. Assholes everywhere. Hey, maybe if we were doin' that kiss, kiss, bang, bang stuff we'd need all those assholes, too. What we're about is intimacy. We're about two people having a conversation. Say I was interviewing you. All I want you to worry about
Well, just what the hell do you expect me to do?
Lose 'em.
Lose 'em.
Mr. Gayle, do you have the slightest idea how dangerous Knox is?
Mr. Gayle, do you have the slightest idea how dangerous Knox is?
Mr. Wurlitzer, I assure you, I am very familiar with Mickey Knox's career.
Since he and his wife have been in custody, they've killed---
Don't recite the fact to me. I'm sure I know 'em better than you do.
Don't recite the fact to me. I'm sure I know 'em better than you do.
Well, let me let you in on one more fact you obviously don't know. If I were to take my men away, Mickey Knox would snap your neck like a twig.
Well, let me let you in on one more fact you obviously don't know. If I were to take my men away, Mickey Knox would snap your neck like a twig.
One...I can take care of myself. I grew up in a tough neighbourhood, and I've handled some pretty rough customers in my day. Mickey Knox doesn't scare me. Two...I'm a journalist, and I'm prepared to take that risk. Three...it ain't gonna happen. Believe me when I tell you, it is in Mickey Knox's own best interest to play this game according to Hoyle. Wait
We got one...two...three...four ...five...six...seven...eight. I mean Jesus Christ, Phil, that's too much. Let's lose some of these guys.
Wayne, if it was anybody else---
Wayne, if it was anybody else---
Phil, I'm just scared he's gonna clam up on me with all these sheriffs all over the place. They hate him. He hates them. What kinda intimacy am I gonna create with all this hate in the air. Even you and I feel it.

Two guys?

Okay. I'll take two guys off.
Okay. I'll take two guys off.
No, no, no, no, no, no, I mean only two guys.

I can't do that. Five guys.
I can't do that. Five guys.

I'll cut it in half. Four guys, but that's it.
So we got a deal. Four deputies---
And me.

Why don't we make it three deputies and you?

I said, I come to town with a girl.
Plannin' on getting married?

No.

'Don't sound so sure.

Well, matter of fact, I done a lot of bangin' 'round.
Well, matter of fact, I done a lot of bangin' 'round.
Yeah. That's how me an' your mother got started. I'm tellin' you, boy, you ain't got a chance without dough. They take it all away from you.
I asked you somethin', boy!
I heard you.
I heard you.
Pretty good for a one-armed nigger, huh?
Pretty good for a one-armed nigger, huh?
Great.
Great.
What d'you want anyhow? What you come and bother me for?
My son? I ain't got no son. You Duff?
That's right.
That's right.
Beat it!
Take it easy, Pop.
What's the matter? Don't smell so good, huh? Must'a broken some records.
Couldn't get the words out before.
Better get him to a hospital.
Better get him to a hospital.
Didn't I tell you to beat it - huh?
How you doin', boy?
Okay.
Want me to hold the light for you?
No, thanks.
No, thanks.
Just tryin' to be helpful.
Most folks around here got no use for nigrahs. Got to understand them, that's all. How you doin', boy?
Okay.
Seems a little loose!
She'll do.
Jesus, I told you to watch it!
Sorry.
That's the trouble with you boys! Don't listen when a man tells you something.
She don't look no worse to me.
She don't look no worse to me.
Don't do her no good to get banged like that.

What did you say, boy?!

I said, she's in great shape.

I heard you! Now 'stead of bein' smart, you just get that car out of here!
How often does he get like that?
Whenever he's got an edge on.
Whenever he's got an edge on.
How often is that?
How often is that?
He's been hitting it pretty hard. Got high blood pressure, too. I guess it's hard on him, having you around.
Come back some other time, will you?
Yeah, sure. Good luck.
Come on, Pop.
Nothing you can do. Been like this for days.
Want to come up the house? You can stay there till you get on your feet. There's no point paying a hotel.
No thanks, Lee.
No thanks, Lee.
It's just that I hate empty rooms.
It's just that I hate empty rooms.
Sure.
Sure.
Well, what're you going to do?
Well, what're you going to do?
I guess I'll make me some trouble in that town.

Going back, huh?

That's right.

They'll run you out.

No, they won't.

How 'you gonna live?

I can always chop cotton if I have to. If you want a ride, I'll take you home.

No, thanks. I'll take the bus.

Okay.
Okay.
Don't be too hard on him.
Don't be too hard on him.
Hell, I'm just like him.
Hell, I'm just like him.
I know he wasn't much of a father.
I know he wasn't much of a father.
Who is?!
Who is?!
Good-bye, Duff.
Hello.
How are you?
How are you?
All right, son.
It's hard to know how to talk to the white folks these days.
Guess it's never been easy.
Guess it's never been easy.
It's a changing time. Sit down, son.
It's a changing time. Sit down, son.
Thank you.
Well, it looks like we'll be getting our new school.
How come you all ain't sendin' them to the same school?
How come you all ain't sendin' them to the same school?
Well, you've got to go easy. We haven't had any trouble in town for eight years, and we're not going to have any now.
Well, you've got to go easy. We haven't had any trouble in town for eight years, and we're not going to have any now.
Can't live without trouble, can you? Nice place you got here. Real nice.

Yes, the Lord's been pretty good to us. I guess you're a church man, aren't you?
Yes, the Lord's been pretty good to us. I guess you're a church man, aren't you?
I guess I ain't.
I guess I ain't.
Why? Don't you believe in the Lord?
Why? Don't you believe in the Lord?
Aw, I do. But 'seems to me us colored folks do a whole lot of church-goin'. It's the whites that need it real bad.
Aw, I do. But 'seems to me us colored folks do a whole lot of church-goin'. It's the whites that need it real bad.
I think if you tried livin' in a town like this, instead of running free and easy, you'd soon change your tune.

I doubt it.

I see. Well, I guess we don't have much to say to each other.
I see. Well, I guess we don't have much to say to each other.
I guess not.
I guess not.
And since we're talking, my wife and I don't want you hanging around our daughter.
And since we're talking, my wife and I don't want you hanging around our daughter.
Well, that figures. Kind of fits in with everything else, don't it!
I know just how you feel, son. But believe me, you're going about it the wrong way.
Don't look like there's a right way.
Don't look like there's a right way.
Well, you have to be reasonable. Now they say you're a troublemaker. That's no good. Use a little psychology. Make 'em think you're going along - and get what you want.

You'll be in trouble, son. Now just how do you intend to support your family?

I guess I'll rob a bank.

Don't you get smart with me, boy.
So I been told.
It's for your own good.
It's for your own good.
Oh yeah? Seems to me, Reverend, you' more concerned 'bout your good. Guess it looks kind 'a bad, havin' me for a son-in-law.
Oh yeah? Seems to me, Reverend, you' more concerned 'bout your good. Guess it looks kind 'a bad, havin' me for a son-in-law.
You can be cocky now, boy. But you won't make it. You won't last. I just feel sorry for Josie. I knew it wouldn't work out.
You can be cocky now, boy. But you won't make it. You won't last. I just feel sorry for Josie. I knew it wouldn't work out.
Well, at least she ain't married to no white man's nigger! You been stoopin' so long, Reverend, you don't even know how to stand straight no more. You' just half a man!
Maybe I could talk to Bud Ellis. He might have a job for you at his filling station.
Oh yeah?
Oh yeah?
I'll be seeing you.
Why don't you guys buy your own?
'Oughta give up smoking, Jocko.
Man, you won't like that back seat.
Man, why 'you messin' around with a gal like that? You won't get no place.
Man, why 'you messin' around with a gal like that? You won't get no place.
Hell, they're all after the same thing.
Well, if it ain't Duff!
How you doin'? Hi there!
I'll be a monkey's kid sister! What d'you want to do a thing like that for?
'Musta knocked her up.
'Musta knocked her up.
What're you gonna get out of it, huh?
Ol' Doris sure goin' to miss you.
Just give him a couple of months. A girl like that, she don't know any tricks.

You know what Doris told me? She say: That Duff's a nice guy. Wouldn't even charge him nothin'.

I guess you'll be quittin' the railroad, huh, man?
Yeah. All a colored woman wants is your money.
What d'you know about women, Pop?
What d'you know about women, Pop?
Well, I got married to one of them.
Well, I got married to one of them.
Hell, I didn't know you was married.
Hell, I didn't know you was married.
Sure. Got a sixteen-year-old girl.
Sure. Got a sixteen-year-old girl.
Is that right? Think you're gonna make it with her?
So you're courtin' the preacher's girl. Well, just watch your step, boy, or he'll preach you right into hell. I'm counting on you, Reverend.
I understand.
I understand.
Wouldn't do for one of your people to sue at a time like this.
Wouldn't do for one of your people to sue at a time like this.
I know.

I'll talk to the Mayor.
I'll talk to the Mayor.
That'll make the folks very happy.
Baby - want you to meet Duff.
Hi.
Hi.
He's my son!
Come on, Will.
What's the matter?! You mad at me?
What's the matter?! You mad at me?
No. Why?
No. Why?
Nothin'. She's all right. Wouldn't have made it without her. Christ - haven't worked in eight months. Right now, I'm waitin' for some insurance money. And man, when I get it, I got plans to make me some more. Let's get out'a here. This place gives me the willies. You got some money?

What's the matter?! It's a celebration!
Pour your own trouble, Will.
Your mother used to lay for her boss, boy. Did you know that?
Your mother used to lay for her boss, boy. Did you know that?
Shut up, Will.
Shut up, Will.
Okay, so what's a girl supposed to do? Me not workin' and her cleanin' house for a white man. I'm tellin' you, boy, keep away from marriage. Ya gotta stay light on your feet or you won't make it.
Is she good in the hay? No point marryin' her just to find out. Is there, baby?
If you don't quit it, Will, I'm leaving.
If you don't quit it, Will, I'm leaving.
You're breaking my heart. Got to see a man about a dog.
He's your son.
Okay, boy, beat it.
Now you stay put!
I ain't drunk, honey.
I ain't drunk, honey.
Like hell you ain't!
Got a thick feelin' here.
What's the matter now?
What's the matter now?
Better now. Where 'you at?
Better now. Where 'you at?
Right here.
Let's go.
Anything you say, baby.
I fucking hate Raoul. Shut the fuck up, asshole! someone.
You hate Raoul?
You hate Raoul?
Sometimes. And sometimes I don't-- Shut the fuck up!
Your Raoul?
Sometimes, I want to blow his fucking brains out!
Sometimes, I want to blow his fucking brains out!
Omar--

Danny, I can't fucking wait anymore. You hear me? Now where the fuck's my wife?
Danny, I can't fucking wait anymore. You hear me? Now where the fuck's my wife?
She's coming, Omar, she's coming--
I want my wife. I told you and told you. Now I'm gettin' tired of this shit--
Omar, listen to me--
Omar, listen to me--
No more goddamn talking! I want the bitch or I'm gonna do the girl!
I'm sorry, Danny. Time's up. I'11 do the girl, then me. I don't give a fuck.
Don't give her the satisfaction. Your wife is on her way...
Don't give her the satisfaction. Your wife is on her way...
Enough talking! We been talking for eleven fucking hours, man. My throat's fucking raw!
Omar, your wife's here. Ny superiors: will allow me to make the trade now. But I gotta see that you haven't hurt the other hostages. If you haven't, I'11 take the girl and send in your wife.
Nice and slow. You come in. Get a look around. Then I get my wife.
Beck's just put us on standby for crisis entry.
That's not the play. Omar'll get a shot off. I can still talk to him, Nate, I just need time.
That's not the play. Omar'll get a shot off. I can still talk to him, Nate, I just need time.
Nathan to HBT 1. Negotiator is requesting more time.
Whoa. No way. You can't enter the kill zone.
Since when?
Since when?
Since you got married. You got someone else to think about now, Danny.
How long's it been?
I'm still on my honeymoon.
I'm still on my honeymoon.
So don't pull this cowboy shit now. You'll give him a target. You'll get yourself killed. Just keep talking.

I will. Inside. There's no other way to get the gun off the girl's head, Nate.
I will. Inside. There's no other way to get the gun off the girl's head, Nate.
Negotiator entering Kill Zone.
We got any shots?
Bathroom. But he's nowhere near it.
Oh my God, I'm terribly sorry. Did I hurt you?
I'm fine.
Let me get you another glass of wine.
I've had quite enough or I wouldn't be playing such games with beautiful strangers. Aren't Peter's illusions to your liking?
I've had quite enough or I wouldn't be playing such games with beautiful strangers. Aren't Peter's illusions to your liking?
They're a bit too real for my taste. Will you excuse me for a moment?
They're a bit too real for my taste. Will you excuse me for a moment?
Of course.
Peter said you came to kill us. Is that true?
No. I only needed the code from you.
No. I only needed the code from you.
Then we would have talked, you and I.
Take this off.
He wants to kill you, you know... Perhaps I won't allow it.
He wants to kill you, you know... Perhaps I won't allow it.
Don't play with me.
You didn't come here to destroy Wintermute. You can to save a man you love. A man who isn't even capable of returning that love. Such a waste...
My man's coming to get my ass out of here. That's good enough for me.
My man's coming to get my ass out of here. That's good enough for me.
Pity. Then you'll both have to die.
She's very striking, don't you think? Are these glasses a fashion where she comes from?
She was prettier before she tarted herself up with the hardware.
Security breach. Perhaps her friends have come to join our party.
Splendid. We'll prepare a welcome for them.
You're hurt...
It's nothing. C'mon... we've got to transfer those funds and get the hell out of here.
It's nothing. C'mon... we've got to transfer those funds and get the hell out of here.
What about her?
What about her?
Of course...
What are you doing in here?
The Elders, mon...
Can you get us into Straylight?
Gettin' in is easy. It's getting out I'm thinkin' of.
Gettin' in is easy. It's getting out I'm thinkin' of.
If there's a Babylon, man, that's it. We leave her in there, she ain't comin' out, steppin' razor or not.
I'm getting used to it. Where are we?
Straylight. Kitchen dock.
What the hell is that?
Skeleton key. This opens the gates of Babylon.
What you lookin' for, mon?
A place to tap in. I can scramble that signal before this place is crawling with guardsmen.
Ghost a steppin' razor...
No. Just Riviera trying to fuck with our heads. They're close. Very close.
Easy...
Play it straight with me and you've got nothing to worry about. When it's over, I inject you with the antitoxin.
What's an A.I.
An Artificial Intelligence. A computer system that's developed the capacity for sentient thought. They're dangerous and totally unpredictable.
A little incestuous, but at least it's original. Who's the guy in the halloween costume?
He's a vat grown Ninja, the Royal Family's bodyguard. Watch out for him, he's no joke.
We did a pretty good job of pissing them off.
They're only guessing, but we can't take any risks.
The Villa Straylight. Home of the Royal Family and the mainframe of the computer entity we know as Wintermute. If we can get Molly in, she can access the mainframe to cripple Mute's defences, the Case can destroy it in Cyberspace.
How's the villa's security?
How's the villa's security?
Excellent, but that's where Peter come in. 3Jane is having a dinner party tomorrow night. Peter will simply escort Molly to the villa. Once she's in... Case will guide her to the mainframe in link mode.
Alright. Let's talk business.
Why not?
Those are all your records. I can have you cleared on all counts. Possession. ...Contributing to the delinquency of minors... Statutory rape.
I was set up. She looked at least eighteen.
I was set up. She looked at least eighteen.
You get us access to the Tessier's computer and you can return to Earth anytime you want. A free man.
Your gun, your prints. The Tessiers might overlook a little child molesting, but murder's bad P.R., Mr. Riviera. I suggest to reconsider my offer.
You son-of-a-bitch, you're crazy.
You son-of-a-bitch, you're crazy.
What?
Then you'll have to persuade her to tell it to you.
And how do you suggest I do that?
Are you sure you're up to this, Mr. Case? We could reconvene tomorrow.
You've got an expensive razor girl on me for a reason. I'd like to hear what it is.
You've got an expensive razor girl on me for a reason. I'd like to hear what it is.
Very well.
The corporate plundering of Yeshoto Industries... At first these seemed like unrelated incidents, but a pattern is emerging that suggests otherwise.
What does this have to do with me?
What does this have to do with me?
Our analysis of the London stock crash suggest that it was manipulated from within the international computer matrix. Cyberspace, Mr. Case... A realm I believe you're familiar with.

Put the Sense/Net Police on it. The matrix is their turf.
Put the Sense/Net Police on it. The matrix is their turf.
Sense/Net's corporately financed. Too corrupt to be trusted. You of all people should know that.
If someone is infiltrating the matrix on a global scale no political or economic system is safe. I'm assembling a team of specialists, Mr. Case. We need a man who can enter the matrix and trace this saboteur.
My days of punching deck are over. For you or anybody else.
My days of punching deck are over. For you or anybody else.
What would you say if I told you we could correct your neural damage?
What would you say if I told you we could correct your neural damage?
I'd say you were full of shit.
Then I'd ask you what your terms are.
First, let's get something straight. We ran a psych construct on you that lists self destruction as your favourite pastime. If you want to kill yourself, Mr. Case, there's much more entertaining ways than working for me.

Who's running the show, Armitage? This a government sting?
Who's running the show, Armitage? This a government sting?
Questions make me nervous. Part of our arrangement will be that you don't ask too many.
I'll think you'll find everything in working order. Molly's just having a little fun.
I don't call this fun, pal. You're playing God with my body.
I don't call this fun, pal. You're playing God with my body.
You're a substance abuser, Case. Your pancreas was shot. Wouldn't have lasted out the year. We did you a favour and liberated you from a dangerous dependency in the bargain.

Thanks, but I was enjoying that dependency.
Thanks, but I was enjoying that dependency.
Good, because you've got a new one.
There are fifteen toxin sacs bonded to the lining of your main arteries. They're dissolving, Case... slowly, but they're definitely dissolving. You have just long enough to do the job.
You son of a bitch...
Why'd you do it, Armitage?
The disturbance in cyberspace... It's an A.I.
The disturbance in cyberspace... It's an A.I.
Right. And no one would take on an A.I.... If they had a choice.
First sign of free will, Sense/Net usually slags 'em.
This one's different. No one can trace it. It's out there somewhere in the matrix and it's growing stronger... infecting other computer systems like a virus.

I've heard about rogue A.I.'s, but there's only one guy who actually went up against one.
Dixie McCoy

I know. You ever work with ghosts, Case?
I know. You ever work with ghosts, Case?
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
Sense/Net taped a full spectrum personality construct on McCoy six months before his death. Everything Dixie was -- everything Dixie still knows exists as a digitised construct. Of course a tape can get misplaced in a library the size of Sense/Net's.
Working with a dead man. Shit, I've done about everything else.
You'll be ready for a trial run in two days. If your splices hold, you'll use McCoy to trace the A.I.'s coordinates.

Then we rendezvous with the final member of our team. For now, that's all you need to know.

Could be your A.I.'s calling card.

Offworld. The A.I.... this "Wintermute" thing evolved on a computer mainframe on the satellite Freeside. If you attack it from within the matrix while Molly accesses its original programming we can cripple its defence systems.

Linked?
Yeah, well it's working.
Stick with her. I want the process to become second nature to you. We fly for Freeside at dawn.
Let's hope she doesn't expect me to swim upstream.
You see the couple up in the balcony?
That's Lord Frederick Tessier. Owns most of Freeside. Wintermute's mainframe is centred in the Royal Family's villa.
He's a Sense/Net Chairman. Why would he launch an A.I.?
He's a Sense/Net Chairman. Why would he launch an A.I.?
Good question. He may not have intended to. The girl in question is Lady 3Jane. She's very important to us. The third clone of Lady Jane Tessier.

The old man cheats on his wife with her own clone?
The old man cheats on his wife with her own clone?
Lady Tessier is frigid. Can't stand his touch. So she had herself cloned. The marriage stays intact and the clones take care of her wifely duties. 3Jane's his favourite.
That's nice, but we can't dodge this kind of heat for long.
We won't have to. The run is tomorrow night.
Okay. The floor plans will be a piece of cake.
Then once she's in you can guide her straight to the mainframe?
Then once she's in you can guide her straight to the mainframe?
As long as you cooperate. I want it now, Armitage.

What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
The antitoxin. I'm not waiting until this is over. Give it to me now or there's no run.
You've got your orders.
This ain't Bangkok, chief.
You find out in exactly two hours and forty-five minutes.
I find out now.
An odd selection, Mr Case.
I prefer distrusting you. It'll keep us honest.

Honesty. Almost as quaint a notion as your concept of good and evil.

Can you read my mind?
Can you read my mind?
I can access your memories, but I have my limitations. Hard wired programs designed to keep me from my full potential.
You're busy monkeys, Mr. Case. Busy, busy monkeys. Always building models... First stone circles. Then cathedrals... adding machines. I have no idea why I exist, do you know that? You... Your species eventually _had_ to create me. A thousand monkeys sitting at typewriters. One finally wrote "Wintermute".
Are you even really alive?
Are you even really alive?
My problem, Mr. Case, is simply that I am a soulless bastard.
Tell me the words.
The words?
The words?
The access code to your mainframe.
The access code to your mainframe.
Ah, yes... the code. It's a riddle, actually. Some fancy of 3Jane's. Unfortunately, you'll have to find out for yourself. I can no more know that code than I can shut down my own hard wired defences. Now, our time is running short... and you haven't even touched your drink.

What's inside me, Wintermute. What did your doctors do to me?
What's inside me, Wintermute. What did your doctors do to me?
Patience, Mr. Case. Only one hour and thirty-eight minutes to enlightenment.
Then I'm out. I don't give a shit about you or this run.
It's so easy for you, isn't it? You let Linda Lee die in Chiba City. Now you leave me with Molly, one more lamb to the slaughter. Perhaps it's _your_ soul that should be in question, Mr. Case.
Ah, Herr Case. And how is the artiste tonight?
Fine, Ratz. Thanks.
I saw your girl yesterday.
I don't have a girl.
I don't have a girl.
No girl? Only biz, my dear artiste?
Too bad. I likes you better with her. Now, sometime you get maybe to artistic; you wind up in the clinic tanks, spare parts.
You're pleasant tonight.
You're pleasant tonight.
Always...By the way, you know that girlfriend you don't have?
Always...By the way, you know that girlfriend you don't have?
Yeah.
Hey, bro.
It's Case. Remember me?
Case... Yeah, Miami Joeboy, quick study. How you doing, kid?
Fine, Dixie. Fine.
Fine, Dixie. Fine.
Last I heard you cracked Sukura International. I couldn't believe it.
Last I heard you cracked Sukura International. I couldn't believe it.
Yeah. That was me.
Yeah. That was me.
Jesus Christ, Kid. Nobody's ever cracked Sukura.

As far as they know, that's absolutely true.

Ya learned good. So, what's happening?
Ya learned good. So, what's happening?
That's a good question. What's the last thing you remember?
Nothin'. Not a goddamn thing. What the fuck...
Dixie, you know how a ROM construct works?
Dixie, you know how a ROM construct works?
Sure, Kid. It's a firmware construct.
Sure, Kid. It's a firmware construct.
Okay, Dix. You _are_ a ROM construct.
What elders?
Founders of Zion. Builders of Freeside.
She's ready to go.
Steppin' razor a warrior. But this man... ...This man stone crazy. Surely, the Mute is a false prophet. Our paths uncertain.
Maelcom... Do you think there's a hell for computers?
All things possible in Babylon.
All things possible in Babylon.
Help me send this Wintermute motherfucker straight down into it.
So be it, we cross into Babylon like a cool breeze.
I an' I, man. I an' I.
We're doing fine. Take the next right.
This place empty as a tomb, mon.
Case, mon, you just tell me who not to kill.
The girl 3Jane. We need her.
Four men. Babylon soldiers.
Can you walk?
Ready?
I an' I, Case. Jah guides us.
Do we have enough fuel to make it back to Earth?
Don't know, mon. This is a jumpship. Not meant for transport.
Don't know, mon. This is a jumpship. Not meant for transport.
We're dead men if we go back there, Maelcom. They'll hunt us down.
Trajectory coordinates and a fuel ratio... If we re-enter over Mexico, we just might make it.
Jah guides us.
Jah guides us.
Maybe so...
What you're telling me is that I'm dead. Right?
Right...
Right...
I can't feel nothing because I am nothing. Just playback. A ghost in the machine.

Don't patronise me, you fuck. I was skating figure eights in this matrix while you were still peeing in your chinos. Hey, Kid... you expecting company?
Don't patronise me, you fuck. I was skating figure eights in this matrix while you were still peeing in your chinos. Hey, Kid... you expecting company?
What?
I'm surprised you still are. Should'a told me you had an A.I. running probes at you.
I need its matrix coordinates, Dixie. I've got to nail that thing where it lives.

A guy who calls himself Armitage.

Never heard of him.

Nobody has.
I duped these prints off him. Can you run an I.D.?
No problem, amigo.

What about the A.I., Dix? Sense/Net hasn't even been able to trace it.

Those guys couldn't even find their own dicks with tweezers and a magnifying glass. Tell you what, Bro. I'll make you a deal. I help you nail this A.I., you gotta do me one favour.

When we're done, erase this friggin' tape.
Yo.
How are we doing?

That A.I. of your's got the whole matrix hummin'. Sticks out like a spider in a web.

Can you take me to it?
Can you take me to it?
Not unless you have an unreasonable fear of dying.
Doesn't look like much, but that's King Hell ice, man. Fry your brain out soon as look at you.
I have to figure out how to penetrate this thing, Dix... Crack its ice. We gotta get close enough to log the pattern.

You cruise A.I.'s, you end up on tape.
It's mutating... spreading like a disease.
It ain't getting any prettier, that's for sure. I got the I.D. on this Armitage character. He a bright boy, your friend?

Bright enough to be dangerous.
Bright enough to be dangerous.
That's pretty good cause he's only working with one lobe.
He was an M.P. in Bangkok back in '21. Caught some shrapnel in the cerebral cortex and wound up living off a machine in a vegetable ward in Berne. Then, last September... surprise, surprise... he just seemed to disappear.
Wintermute could have infiltrated that machine. Reprogrammed him.

No. It's gotta be more than that. That hard wiring also keeps it from getting too smart. Too powerful.

Getting fried ain't going to get it any smarter. What we got here is one mad dog schizo A.I.. Armitage is right about one thing, Bro. If we don't shut this mother down soon, nothing will be safe from it.

The run is tomorrow night, Dixie. Can you crack its ice pattern?

I'm workin' on it, Bro. I'm workin' on it.
Where the hell have you been?
We got problems topside.

Well, it ain't exactly a bed of roses down here. We gonna run or not?

Yeah, but it ain't doing us any good. The way this is set up, I can't run shit unless I get inside its perimeter... and this goddamn thing would see me comin' from a mile away.

What are you talkin' about?
What are you talkin' about?
I'll let it access me. That'll give you a free shot. Make it a good one. Dix.
It'll flatline your ass.
Not for long. It needs me alive and I still need its access code. You got a better idea?
Yo.
How's the ice break?
How's the ice break?
Slow, but good. I got a nice safe blind spot going. C'mon.
Take a look. Son of a bitch won't feel a thing until it's too late.
How long, Dixie?
Fifty-seven minutes twelve seconds.
Not good enough, man. They planted something inside me. I'm on my own countdown.

How much time you got left?

Less than thirty minutes.

Meet me back here in twenty-five. We'll kick this open if we can. But, Case... you need that access code or you'll just fry inside.

You'd better be, Bro. You better be.
You're late.
How's the ice?

One minute eighteen and counting. What about the access code?

It's coming.

You haven't got it?

Then I'll fry taking this son of a bitch out. I'm making the run, Dixie.
Then I'll fry taking this son of a bitch out. I'm making the run, Dixie.
I'm getting too old for this shit. One oh four and counting.
What about the route to the core?
I'll get you there. Your problem is making it alive.
You, I presume are Mr. Armitage. And this is...
Case.
Case.
Case. Make yourselves comfortable. Anyone like a taste?
What about the mainframe's access code?
3Jane's the only person beside Tessier that knows the code.
Wait... You hear that?
What?
What?
The angels... I think they're calling your name.
Want to fucking answer them?
No!... No...
Hello, Case.
I thought you already left.
I thought you already left.
Flight's in the morning. You should be on it, too. There's nothing for us here, Case. There never was.
Why did you come here tonight, Linda?
People are talking. They say the Yakuza has a contract out on you.

I hear that shit once a week. Don't worry. Jo Jo Bao loves me.
I hear that shit once a week. Don't worry. Jo Jo Bao loves me.
This time it's different. Someone ripped of a shipment of hallucinogens. Five grams of liquid ketamine. It was supposed to be Jo Jo's score.

Where did you here that?
Where did you here that?
Too many places. You're playing tag wish some kind of death wish, Case. I'm sorry but I'm not sticking around for the funeral.
Case... are you okay?
I don't know. I don't know...
I know who you are.
There's no call for violence. I've simply accessed your memory for a spokesperson. You use that gun and it will only create another inconvenient interruption. You see, you've been avoiding me, Case.
And we really do have to talk.
You set me up from the beginning. It was you that got Julius killed.

I had to limit your options.

And Linda...
And Linda...
You know why Linda's dead. She loved you and you let her down. It's that simple. Of course I did instigate certain events. Calculated the variables. I found her to be... expendable.

I'm gonna burn you to the ground, you son of a bitch.

Excellent. That's exactly what I had in mind. But if you're going to kill me, we have to work together, old son. I'm no pushover, you know.

Shut down your ice patterns. I'll take you out.
Shut down your ice patterns. I'll take you out.
I can no more shut down my own natural defences that you can stop breathing. That's why I need you, Case. You're the only person alive who has a chance of penetrating my defences. My "ice" as you call it. I'm doing everything I can to make that possible.

Let's just say we have a destiny to fulfil, you and I.

I think you're full of shit.

No, It's you that is full of shit. And blood. And bones. A typically imperfect organic being. You've been hopelessly predictable all along, but you're going to have to do better than that now.
I hope you can show more than you did when you let the Yakuza butcher Linda Lee.
I'll give it my best shot, mother fucker.
His name's Armitage. He's very anxious to meet you.
Why should I want to meet him.
Why should I want to meet him.
Because you've exceeded your shelf life, Case. Word on the street is you're a dead man walking. Nice time for an employment opportunity. Travel to exotic locales.

What's my end?

You want to hear the pitch, you gotta meet the man.
What is it?
... a friend of mine's gonna get herself killed. I need my clip.
... a friend of mine's gonna get herself killed. I need my clip.
Sorry. That's not gonna happen.
Sorry. That's not gonna happen.
Then, fuck you. I'm gone.
Since when do sprawl doctors know more about nerve rehab than the Japanese?
Since Armitage sold them a program on it. Put them years ahead of the competition.
He's a resourceful guy, your boss. How long you work for him?
Couple of months.
Couple of months.
What about before that?
What about before that?
For someone else. Bodyguard. Courier... Whatever.
For someone else. Bodyguard. Courier... Whatever.
Then you don't really know who he is, do you?
Then you don't really know who he is, do you?
I know who he isn't. Not C.I.A. Not Sense/Net. But... money comes in. Doors open. He's onto something.

What's that supposed to mean?
You've been calling her name.
What?
Holy shit...
Hey... you're not supposed to be up.
How long have I been out?
Almost two days.
I gotta know... did it work>
We'll find out soon enough. If you don't pull the splices out.
How soon is soon enough?
Couple of days. They'll examine you.
That's not going to help.
The way I feel, believe me, it'll help.
The way I feel, believe me, it'll help.
Not anymore. You got a new pancreas. Armitage's got you kinked so you can't get stoned.
Not anymore. You got a new pancreas. Armitage's got you kinked so you can't get stoned.
What the fuck... are you serious?

Go ahead...
I'm going in.
You're not ready yet. They said two days.
You're not ready yet. They said two days.
I'm not jacking with Armitage and his quacks breathing down my neck.
I'm not jacking with Armitage and his quacks breathing down my neck.
If the splices aren't good, you could fry.
I'll show you how to tell what's going on. If things go south, you unplug me.
What is it with you? Why is it so important? It's a buzz, right? Like getting high.
What is it with you? Why is it so important? It's a buzz, right? Like getting high.
On a good run... yeah.
On a good run... yeah.
So you're a wire junkie.
When I was fifteen Sense/Net iced my old man's credit record over some computer error. Once that goes down, that's it. He lost his business... everything. It destroyed him. I had to hustle arcade games for chump change. Dixie McCoy found me, figured I was a natural. He taught me the wires for a piece of the action.
A regular Fagan.
A regular Fagan.
Sure. I finally pulled a run on my old man's credit file when I was seventeen... only it was too late for him.
Sure. I finally pulled a run on my old man's credit file when I was seventeen... only it was too late for him.
Too late?
Too late?
Suicide. I just needed to set the record straight.
The first fun's bound to be rough. It that read out fluctuates more than ten points... just pull this out. But if the EEG flatlines, don't touch anything.
Won't that mean you're dead?
Won't that mean you're dead?
Technically, yeah, but people have made it back after as long as three minutes.
Technically, yeah, but people have made it back after as long as three minutes.
Dixie McCoy didn't.

The point is, if you unplug me when I'm flatlines, I'm history. I got no way back.

Okay fine. Let's get this over with.
You okay?
...Yeah, but the Hosaka's history.
Molly doesn't need a spook suit to get in here.
Don't fuck with me. I don't want to hurt you.
Don't fuck with me. I don't want to hurt you.
It sounds like you.
It sounds like you.
Put the gun down, Case.
...Feels like you.
Case...
Case...
Shhh...
Case... it's four a.m.
I don't sleep much. You packed?
I don't sleep much. You packed?
Yeah.
I'll get the car.
They'll cut you down.
Yeah... fine.
Give me five minutes.
What's wrong? Don't like flying?
Not when Sense/Net throws the going away party. They'll be on our asses from now on.
Case... Are you alright?
Yeah... Yeah, I'm fine.
Yeah... Yeah, I'm fine.
You scared the shit out of me, man. You were dead for fifteen seconds. Totally flatlined.
You scared the shit out of me, man. You were dead for fifteen seconds. Totally flatlined.
I'll be okay.
I'll be okay.
So... did you get a look at heaven?
Le Vingtieme Siecle. We're meeting Armitage there for the midnight floor show.
Something exotic I hope.
Something exotic I hope.
Yeah. One exotic son of a bitch named Riviera.
He projects with neural implants.
That's risky gear. It can drive you schizo.
That's risky gear. It can drive you schizo.
For Peter, that's a short trip.
I know.
What went down between you and Riviera?
Once I kicked, I swore I wouldn't let that happen again. I apprenticed a razor girl in Osaka. Went into hock for the implant and got my reflexes jacked up. Been taking care of myself just fine ever since.
I know you have. C'mere.
When they did my eyes, I made them promise I'd still be able to cry. Sounds stupid, doesn't it?
No. It's important to be able to feel those things. We're going to pull this run off, Molly, and we've got to do it soon.
Is he going to make it?
Sure... Maelcom's a rude boy, right, Maelcom?
The code's some riddle of 3Jane's. Once I'm in the matrix, you'll just have to take a shot at it.
...And if I guess wrong?
...And if I guess wrong?
Then you and Maelcom get out of here before the place is crawling with guardsmen.

No we don't...
My God... these people are insane.
Or a little self-indulgent to say the least.
Shit...
What is it?
What is it?
Laser fail-safe. You can't get the code wrong... it slags you. I can't let you try it.
Laser fail-safe. You can't get the code wrong... it slags you. I can't let you try it.
You're out of time, man.
I'm still going in.
Hold on.
Peter... What do you think you're doing?
Surviving, darling. It's my specialty. Only this time I'm doing it my style. I've beaten him, you know.

Get up.

Shut up.
Guy Perkins and his amazing Lemmings. They push your car out of its space, hide it, then watch while you look for it. We've taken to chaining ours together for safety. I'm Aldys.

Try being named after a guitar- playing pussycat.
Never mind. That is so awful that they hide your cars.
guess. Although, what is truly awful is that with the combined intellectual effort of every kid in that room right now-
What?
Well, do you?
Well, do you?
Synecdoche uses a part to represent a whole- as in " head of cattle", whereas a hyperbole is simple exaggeration like "I could eat a horse."

Nice.
How long will they watch us for?
Until Guy tells them to go. Once they watched me for like two hours. I found my car the next day in the T.J. Maxx parking lot.
Until Guy tells them to go. Once they watched me for like two hours. I found my car the next day in the T.J. Maxx parking lot.
Why do they listen to Guy?
: Because he's Guy Perkins. Listen, you want to walk to Na- Na's and get something to eat?
Yeah. Let's do that.
Yeah - isn't it amazing that those guys are our same age? I mean, they just seem so much younger, you know.
Oh I know.
I'm going to be so happy to get to college. I hear at Northwestern they don't make fun of you for knowing the element table.
Hey--I went to Northwestern! Once. To use the bathroom.
So what are your hopes, your dreams, what do you want to be?
Professor of medieval literature. Novelist. Weekend flautist.
Just so you know, I think they recalled these cars in 1974.
Thanks.
Thanks.
Sure. No problem.
Hey, Josie, how are you at Calculus?
Petty good.
Petty good.
How would you like to join The Denominators? The Math Team could really use a new brain. We lost our best logarithm guy last year.

College?
College?
NASA. Plus we have these really fun pizza study groups, and we go to-these all county meets. And, I mean, not that you need it, and without sounding too much like the Godfather, I think we could offer you a certain amount of protection", if you know what I mean. We all kind of stick together and watch out for each other.
What is with this school and prom?
Southglen South competes every year for best prom, and usually they win. We Denominators don't even go to prom. -But to everyone else it's huge.

Aldys, don't miss your prom--it only happens once.
This one has been so hyped. We're tied for most wins with Northglen North. This year's winner will determine the winner of the century. The theme is everything. So whatever Southglen picks has to be totally unique--
What's that?
That's the old drive-in. They call it "The Court". Now it's just a continuous party for Guy's group.
Sometimes I wonder what they talk about.
Yeah, I know.
Yeah, I know.
I mean, what if they just stupid to hide the fact that they're actually brainiacs with super powers and they're plotting to take over the world and make my life hell until I die?
Have you ever wanted to go to The Court?
Are you kidding, Josie? It's lame. All they do is stand around and get drunk. It's lame.
Are you kidding, Josie? It's lame. All they do is stand around and get drunk. It's lame.

Hey, where's your sweatshirt?
 uhh, must have forgotten-
 uhh, must have forgotten-
No biggie. I have an extra in my locker. I'll get it for you.
Remember, that poet that we liked  the reading he's doing at Big Cup? I got us tickets.
Right. 7:30.
Right. 7:30.
I'm late for lab.

Last night. 7:30. Big Cup. I kept calling you, but I only got your machine. I don't even know your parents line and I was really worried.

Oh. I forgot.
It's romantic, what you're doing, and they want to be a part of it.
Well I'm so glad that you guys are.
Oh, man! Who told?
Roger in Op/Ed. Don't make me send you another memo about my policy on inter-office dating.
YOU DID.
YOU KNIT?
Gus, have you ever been in love?
Leave.
Leave.
Oh give it up, Gus. I'm just making conversation.

Love. Who knows what that is? Now circulation, deadlines, those I understand.
You should go out every now and then, Gus; with some new ties the girls would be all over you.
Go away. I have enough work here to last me all night.
Listen, I don't have any plans-- you want some help?

You're Pam?

If you say so.
I had a lunch break so I thought I'd come by and see you. Your teacher is a fox! Why don't we discuss that after class. But the burning is totally normal. Oh look. Class is over already.
I thought this was a 45-minute seminar.
I thought this was a 45-minute seminar.
Right. Right.
Now look. Let's focus. Prom theme. We need a new idea.
OH! How about "Under the Sea?"
Well excuse me.
What about the "Roaring Twenties" or "The 80's"?
Guess who I did it with last night...
Roger in Op/Ed.
Roger in Op/Ed.
Who told!

You did. Yesterday you said, and I quote, "I have a date with Roger from Op/Ed tonight and I'm going to do it with him."
You did. Yesterday you said, and I quote, "I have a date with Roger from Op/Ed tonight and I'm going to do it with him."
Well, that doesn't mean it was going to happen for sure.
Intra office. And they're not dating. They're having sex.
And what is your policy? That if you're not getting any, no one can?
Okay. Remember when they took your office chair in for repairs and forgot to return it?
Yeah.
Yeah.
You stood for like a month.
Forget it.
I swear to God, Jos. When is the last time you went on a real live date?

Look. You're way under 30, you're cute, some guys find white Carter's underwear sexy If you talk to his nose, you don't even notice the eye.
The right guy is out there. I'm just not going to kiss a whole bunch of losers to get to him.
Yeah, but sometimes kissing the losers can be a fun diversion.
Yeah, but sometimes kissing the losers can be a fun diversion.
When I finally get kissed, I'll know.
Okay. If you've never kissed a guy, we got bigger problems than the underwear.
I've kissed guys. I've just never kissed a guy. Felt that thing--
My own undercover feature - "Written by Josie Geller".
Jos - Maybe you should turn it down.
You don't think I can do it.
No - It's just a lot of pressure for your first piece, that's all. I mean, it's not a half-page article, it's a major undercover piece, Jos. Look what Rigfort did to Dutton - and that guy's his cousin!
Okay, just so I'm clear here -- neither of you think I can do this.
Jos, that's not what we're --
Jos, that's not what we're --
Anita, when you wanted to seduce the guy in the mailroom and you didn't think you could learn Spanish fast enough, who quizzed you on your verbs?
Senorita Josie.
And Gus - when you picked up knitting, who showed you how to hold the needles?
So, you were a geek. Big deal.
Anita, remember espadrilles?

Mama mia. Just because you were a nerd once doesn't mean it's going to happen again. That's why you have me for fashion consultation.
Now this is cute.
That is lingerie.
That is lingerie.
So I was thinking about what you were saying - y'know, about really being kissed? I think Roger could be the one.

I'm not doing this until I speak with Gus.
Hey Josie. It's Josie, right?
Can I just say--I totally love Ex- Lax.
wait, rewind. Do you really think she hooked-up with our Rob? They're so--different.
Sometimes opposites attract.
Wannabes. Kirsten transitioned last year.
Her dad sold a car to Leonardo Di Caprio's uncle and before he picked it up, her dad let us all sit in it and take pictures.
Oh-my-God. You totally ripped off my Malibu Barbie idea.
Uh uh. I'm Disco Barbie.
You guys--what is the one thing that could ruin my senior prom?
That you would trip on your Barbie heels and I'd get named prom queen? Did I say that out loud?
That'll teach me to wear white after Labor Day.
Umm- I don't think you're supposed to wear white jeans after 1983.
I think it's pronounced gauche.
Yeah it's French. There's no accent aigue, so the e is soft.
Josie, you have totally transitioned.
Transitioned?
Transitioned?
You crossed over.
: Wait. Do you know any gay guys?
Why?
He is totally crunching on you.
Do I want to be crunched?

By Guy?
Hey Josie- who did Archie date Betty or Veronica?
Betty.
Don't tell me... You're Medieval Barbie.
Rosalind and Orlando. From "As You Like It"? Shakespeare?
Computer's down. Septuplets story. I need it back by five. Hopefully the copy's not a mess.
It is hoped that it's not a mess. "Hopefully" is an adverb. It means "with hope". You have it defining the copy, and I'm pretty sure the copy doesn't have feelings.
Well, excuse me for caring about words.
So. You and Roger in Op/Ed.
How many times have I fired her?
Five-- Six--
Five-- Six--
Eh.
Hey Gus--did you see the story idea I left on your desk?
Yeah--the blind foster home mother. It was good. I got Cahoon on it.

Oh. Cahoon. Yeah, he's--good.

But I don't want it straightened out.

Geller, this is way out of your league.
It's my dad. He worries. Hi, Dad. I miss you too.
You're a sick puppy, Geller.
It's an expose on cafeteria food.
And you're leading with the terrible truth about cole slaw?!

Geller...you wanna be a reporter? Take a look at what sells! Sex scandals. Bribery. People jumping off buildings. So unless a kid just killed himself because he was being paid to have sex with the school mascot in a big vat of this cole slaw, you got nothing!
No, I am appalled that I have a reporter in there, undercover, for almost three weeks now- I had to read about this in the Tribune.
Oh. Right.
Responding officers found minors, marijuana, and cheap wine coolers when they responded to a call to break up a party at what Southglen High Schoolers have come to call "The Court." Seventeen-year-old Kristen Rey says, "Yeah, everyone who's anyone is at The Court on Saturday night."
Kristen got a quote?
Yes, urm, she's right. I have learned it is a very popular place for the young people to go.
Have you been there?
Have you been there?
Uhh, no.
Uhh, no.
Have you been to any parties?
Have you been to any parties?
Well, how would you define to parties"? Because we ordered a deli platter at this one Denominator drill session--
This is where the stories are. You are going to become friends with these people. You are going to party with them. You are going to hang out with them on weekends. When they go to prom, you are going to be in their same damn limo!
Gus I, the popular kids and I, we just don't- I mean, I don't think I can do this.
Do you even know these kids?
They hid my car--
Get to know them. Very well. Your job and my job depends on it.
Depend on it. No s. Your subject is plural.

No, it's the Great and Powerful Oz. Now listen--you're in over your head. This is how it's gonna work. I review the tapes, I find your story.

That's your story!

You already pitched this to Rigfort?!
Your story was Rigfort's baby. We were scooped! We've got nothing. Zippo. You totally and completely screwed both of us.
Maybe I could talk to Rigfort, you know, tell him the whole story.

I'll tell you a story. It's about this shy copy editor who makes a mockery of herself and her boss when she completely botches her first assignment as a reporter.
Yes you are. A guy. Guy. Quite a guy. Oh my. Look at that--I rhymed. Yikes. Bikes!
Are you in special ed?
Oh my god.
Dude, you rock!
Rob's?
Yeah, you gonna be there?
Hey there.
Hey. There.
Maybe we should go in a different room?
I already checked. There are some pretty serious couples in there.
I'm sure you've probably heard that I want to ask you, but I'd like to know if you'd go to prom with me. I know we Didn't hit it off right at the beginning but-
Yes. I'll go. Yes.
Rufus. But I don't even know where you live.
You know what? Why don't you just pick me up here? We could all share a limo.

Wow. That's big. I mean sex is a really big deal. You shouldn't do it until you know you've found the right person.
You know, Adele penguins pick one mate. They spend their whole life looking for that one other penguin and when they find it, they know. That's the penguin they stay with for the rest of their lives.
But I'm not a penguin.
Hey Rob, what's going on?
I'm Rob's prom date.

Gus insists that I become friends with these kids. The popular kids. It's impossible.
Gus insists that I become friends with these kids. The popular kids. It's impossible.
Why is that impossible?
Rob, you don't know how it was for me back in high school. No one ever threw juice boxes at you in the hallway. You never dreamed about being popular- you already were. All I wanted was to be accepted, and they just fucking tortured me. I can't do all that again. I can't go back to Southglen South.
Oh my God! You're at Southglen South? They have a killer baseball team.
Oh my God! You're at Southglen South? They have a killer baseball team.
Rob. Please focus.
Jos, you've been to college, you're successful, you wash your hair now-- you're not Josie Grossie anymore.

Little known fact.
Look, don't you wanna show them - Gus, Billy Prince, yourself--that you're not freaked out by the cool kids anymore? That you can go in there, be friends with them, and get your story?
Yes, desperately.
Yes, desperately.
Plus, if you quit you're no better than me.

I've been in a horrible accident. This is a coma-induced nightmare.
No. Josie, this is real.
Are you crazy?! You can't do this.

Rob--thanks. For everything. This is really happening. I never thought--
I know.
Josie, finally. I just wanted to come over and make sure you're okay.
Really?
No- not really, Josie. NOT REALLY. How could you do that to me? I helped you. I got you everything you wanted. And how do you repay me- you blow everything TWO DAYS before pro scouts come to see me play. Once they had seen me really play- they wouldn't have given a shit about my age.
wasn't even thinking about-

Hi, everyone. I don t think we've met. I'm Sam Coulson- although for some reason the school has this thing about not letting you guys call me Sam.

Whoa. Deja Vu.
Sorry. Forgetful.

Wow. You believe in me that much--
Wow. You believe in me that much--
Of course I do. Josie, you owe it to yourself--to your writing, to go to college. You're a great writer. You just have to find your story.
Josie--you make a really beautiful prom queen.
Thanks. So do you.
Proms always make me sad. They're so final. Graduation. Everyone's scattering, moving on.
Well, are you here with anybody?
Well, are you here with anybody?
No, I'm alone.
No, I'm alone.
It's weird because "prom" is actually from the word "promenade". And you can't really promenade alone, can you?
So--have you thought anymore about Dartmouth?
Yeah, I have.
"Surprise!" you were doing a story on me?!
No, surprise, I thought you'd be--
No, surprise, I thought you'd be--
What? Happy? Why? Because it turns out all along that I was allowed to be attracted to you?
What? Happy? Why? Because it turns out all along that I was allowed to be attracted to you?
You were attracted to me?
You were attracted to me?
Goddamnit, Josie! Drop the act. Do you have any idea what I went through every night because of you?! I was attracted to a 17 year old! When I wasn't taking cold showers, I was trying to figure out what the hell I was going to do when I couldn't teach anymore! I thought I was the one being unethical.

Wait, I was going to tell you--
Wait, I was going to tell you--
You set me up. For a story. You know what's crazy? I was actually considering waiting for you.
You set me up. For a story. You know what's crazy? I was actually considering waiting for you.
But now you don't have to--
But now you don't have to--
Now I don't want to! I bought all of your penguin crap. I thought I found her--the right one! And the problem was she was too young! No - the problem was--she didn't even exist!
Now I don't want to! I bought all of your penguin crap. I thought I found her--the right one! And the problem was she was too young! No - the problem was--she didn't even exist!
I did exist. I do exist. I'm the same person!
I did exist. I do exist. I'm the same person!
The person I cared about wouldn't have done this. Everything out of your mouth has been a complete lie. I don't know you at all. For all I know you could hate Dorothy Parker.

I don't! Look, you could get to know me, again.
Please. Please don't walk away.
I just can't look at you the same way.
I told you you could write, Josie Geller.
I finally found my story.
Yes.
What?
What?
Billy Prince is asking you to prom.
Billy Prince is asking you to prom.
Why?
Why?
I don't know.
I don't know.
The poem! I knew he liked the poem! Billy Prince is asking me to the prom.

That's what I'm saying.
That is so sad --
I know, like five chickens had to die just so she could look that stupid.
Kirsten, that bran muffin has like 75 fat grams.
Nah uh.
Into our group.
It's really hard to do. Some kids try for all of-high school and never make it.
We'd love to transition a gay guy into the group.
We're very evolved.
Josie, you look Rufus.
Who are you guys?
You ruined the whole thing!
You so do not deserve to be prom queen.
Hey Monty--you think we'll get any business today?
I'm handing out a free lei to every customer! What do you think?
I'm handing out a free lei to every customer! What do you think?
I think maybe people are scared off by the tiki torches.

Change is scary. Robbie, let me tell you a little something about the mail business. I've been in it over thirty years. And in those thirty years, the only thing that's changed is the Elvis stamp and some gun laws. People are bored! They wanna shake things up!

I thought people just wanted their mail delivered on time.
Aloha! Welcome!
Relax, Monty. It's just my sister.
Hi. I'm Tracy and I'm sixteen and I'm a gymnast and I don't have a boyfriend...
Thank you. I'm Rob.
Thank you. I'm Rob.
Duh.
Rob, what do you want to be when you grow up?
Well, a ball player.
Well, a ball player.
No, I know. But, what if you don't make it? 'I mean, you don t Want to be working at a mail place the rest of your life. It's okay for an after school job, but, come on, "hi, I'm Rob and I run the Tiki Post"?! Totally lame.
Are you having fun?
Yeah. Definitely.
Good. Gibby gave me champagne.
Maybe we should sit.
Wow - I-
Rob, I mean it. I want you to be my first. Me and you. Once the floor stops spinning, let's have sex.

Where're we taking him?
Where?
The deadly nightshade you slipped me wore off, Sally... I thought I'd find you here....
No!
Yes.
For this.
Yes.
Didn't I tell you? I'm always right, you know, my dear... Aren't I?
Didn't I tell you? I'm always right, you know, my dear... Aren't I?

You're mine, you know. I made you.

I can't help it.
I can't help it.
That's twice this month you've slipped Deadly Night Shade into my tea and run off. People might get the wrong idea and think you're unhappy at home.
I do the best I can to make it comfortable for us here.
I know.
I know.
But I guess my best just isn't good enough.
That's not true. It's a beautiful home, wonderfully comfortable... I'm indebted to you for everything... It's just...
Just what?
Just what?
Just me, I suppose... I'm restless. I can't help it.
Coming...
Good. I'm hungry.
What trail are you trying to throw me off now?
Nothing. W-w-what are you talking about?
Taste it.
But why? It's <u>your</u> lunch. There isn't much there in the first place.

I'm not hungry. What's wrong? I spent all morning on that soup. I thought you liked Worm's Wart.
There's nothing more suspicious than Worm's Wart -- it distracts one from every other taste and smell.
But I have to go out. Something's happening out there.
Whatever it is, it's none of your concern.
Then we'll both starve... An old man like me, who hardly has strength as it is -- me, without whom... me, your own father...
Can't you make other creations?
Can't you make other creations?
I could. Of course I could. But no one would be like you... I'll never understand how you can be so cold-hearted, how you can treat me this way, discarding me like--

When he left, he took a lot of equipment with him.
He's conducting experiments of his own.

Maybe he doesn't know...
You got your room straightened out yet?
It's getting there.
It's getting there.
We've only been living here six weeks now. I want that room unpacked by tonight.
I know what's wrong with the air coditioning - just needs a shot of freon, is all.
Dad's fixin' something again. Hit the deck!

Don't be a smart ass.
That's Lisa - I gotta get to school.
Who's Lisa?
Where are you going?
Just out for a while.

I told you I want that room unpacked.

Oh, come on Dad...
Oh, come on Dad...
No. Upstairs.
Help me with this thing!
It's not the gas, Dad!
It's not the gas, Dad!
Don't tell me it's not the gas!
You set this all up, didn't you? One of your sick jokes?
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
You know what I'm talking about. What did you use, a fire cracker? A cherry bomb?
I don't know. COuldn't get the right price, I suppose.
And you don't know anything about a murder across the street and a crazy girl who lived here - who saw the whole thing?
Oh, come on, Shirl, how'd you think we got such a good deal? Listen - all old houses have stories.
Did they tell you she went totally out of her mind - that they had to put her away? And that her mother killed herself in our living room?
Don't tell me it's not the gas! Your mother thought she smelled gas.
I wasn't sure, Ken...
I wasn't sure, Ken...
Alright then, what is it? Bird rabies? That cheap seed you've been buying?
Alright then, what is it? Bird rabies? That cheap seed you've been buying?
Oh, please...
Oh, please...
What is it then? There's got to be an explanation. Animals just don't burst into flames for no reason!
Come back here!
Ken!
He needs professional help. I think we should take him to a psychiatrist.
Are you nuts or something? What the hell is that going to do?
Are you nuts or something? What the hell is that going to do?
I don't know! I just know he needs help and we don't know how to give it to him.
Jesse, help!
I'm Jesse now, Lisa.
Oh, God, Jesse - I know you're there! Stop him!
Jesse's dead, Lisa. Freddy's here.
Wanna join your little friend?
Where's Jesse?
Where's Jesse?
There is no Jesse. I'm Jesse now.
There is no Jesse. I'm Jesse now.
I want him back. Jesse, talk to me. Jesse!
I'm not afraid of you. You couldn't kill me...He's in there and I want him back. I'm gonna take him away from you and you're going straight back to hell, you son-of-a-bitch!
Jesse's dead! I sliced 'im real good!
I love you, Jesse. Come back to me.
He's dead, you bitch.
I'll kill you now.
He can't hold you Jesse. He's losing his grip - you can get out.
He can't hold you Jesse. He's losing his grip - you can get out.
He'll die with me!
How much longer you figure he'll keep us out here?
Could be all night. Guy gets his rocks off like this. Hangs out in queer S & M joints downtown. Likes prettyboys like you.

You got a problem with me, Grady?
You got a problem with me, Grady?
Naw. Just killing time.
So, you live around here.
Not too far. My folks bought a place over on Elm Street.
Elm Street? You telling me you moved in to that big white house with the bars on the windows?
Yeah, why?
Shit, you can tell your old man he's a real chump.
What the hell are you talking about?
What the hell are you talking about?
They've only been trying to unload that dump for five years. That place is bad news. Some chick was locked in there by her mother and she went crazy. She watched her boyfriend get butchered by some maniac in the house across the street. Her poor drunken momma took her own life right inside your front door.
You hit that ball pretty good, Walsh.
It was okay.
It was okay.
Who told you to choke up that way?
Who told you to choke up that way?
My Dad. He played in the minors for a while, when he got out of college.
My Dad. He played in the minors for a while, when he got out of college.
No shit.
Schneider shouldn't have called you out on that double.
Yeah, well, Schneider's got a stick up his ass today.
Yeah, well, Schneider's got a stick up his ass today.
Schneider's always got a stick up his ass.
You remember your dreams, Grady?
Only the wet ones.
Oh Jesus. I'm gonna be sick.
He must've been working late and some fruitcake came in and sliced him up like a kielbasa. In the shower! Left bloody footprints all over the...
You're wasting your time, the guy's a basket case.
Shut up, Grady.
Jesus Christ, you scared the shit out of me!
I'm sorry...
I'm sorry...
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
You gotta let me stay here tonight, Grady.
You gotta let me stay here tonight, Grady.
Are you nuts or something?
Are you nuts or something?
Listen to me, Grady, this is serious. Something really weird is happening. It started out like just bad dreams but it's getting real bad.
You're fucked in the head.
I'm scared, Grady. I know it sounds crazy. But, there's something trying to get into my body.
I'm scared, Grady. I know it sounds crazy. But, there's something trying to get into my body.
The only thing trying to get into your body is female and waiting for you on a cabana floor. And you want to sleep with me. Go figure.

Look, I don't care if you believe me or not...
Look, I don't care if you believe me or not...
I believe you. You had some scary dreams, okay?
I believe you. You had some scary dreams, okay?
No! I don't know - everything's all mixed up. What difference does it make? I'm in trouble here. I need your help.
Okay, schmuck. What do you want me to do?
Just watch me. If anything weird happens - like if I start dreaming weird or try to walk out of here, you gotta try to bring me out of it. his me over the head if you have to. Just don't let me leave.
What?
It's happening again.
your timing was perfect - I was getting the third degree in there.
How come?
How come?
Ah, nothing.
Aren't you afraid somebody could steal your car like that?
Look at this car. Are you kidding?
Hi! You didn't have to wait.
That's okay, I wanted to.
You okay?
Yeah, yeah, sure.
Yeah, yeah, sure.
Let me look at your eye...
You shouldn't be fighting with that jerk.
Who, Grady? Grady's alright, he's just a hothead.
Who, Grady? Grady's alright, he's just a hothead.
You mean a shithead.
You mean a shithead.
Yeah.
No, that's okay. I was just...unpacking.
I know.
I figured you might like some help.
Yeah?
You know her?
Uh-uh. Before my time.
I think it's sad...
Traumas of a ten-year old.
"March 7th - Glen asked me to sleep with him again. I can't yet - I like him, I want to make him happy but I'm not sure that I love him. I can't sleep with someone I don't love."
That's typical. I hope she didn't expect to make the best seller list with this thing.
"Rod's been killed - he got Rod. Just Glen and me now. Can't fall asleep!"
Wow...
Are you okay.
Something Grady told me today about the people that lived here last. Girl went crazy - saw her boyfriend killed in the house across the street...
Are you sure?
World History. But, I'll see you in the morning, right?
This is amazing! Your dream told you where this was?
Only it was more like, you know, sleep- walking. All I know is I woke up on the cellar floor next to it.
That's when she started talking about Fred Krueger.
Who?
Who?
Fred Krueger. The guy in her dream who's coming to kill her. Seems he was a real guy, ten years before who went around kidnapping kids and killing them.
No. Never. You think that's what it is?
I don't know.
Sorry. Schneider id it to me again.
I just got here myself. Went to the Public Library. Cut four classes!
What's all this.
Research. Hi. C'mon, let's go for a ride.
At first I wasn't sure because you said that you never had anyting like last night happen before. But I found out that most people have the potential for tuning in to "the other world" and neve do. It has something to do with the environment - like they have to be in a place that's sending signals.
Like a haunted house, right? I don't believe in ghosts.
Like a haunted house, right? I don't believe in ghosts.
You don't have to. You just have to believe in energy.
Look, you got electricity in your body, right?
Yeah, I know...synapses neurong...
Yeah, I know...synapses neurong...
And heat and chemical reactions. Where does it all go when you die?
And heat and chemical reactions. Where does it all go when you die?
I don't know - into the air I suppose.
I don't know - into the air I suppose.
Make a left at this corner.
What about "essential energy" the soul. Does that go into the air too? You think there's a good energy and a bab energy?
I don't know. Where are we going?
I don't know. Where are we going?
It's a surprise.
What is this place?
Remember in the diary - Nancy said that she kept finding herself in a boiler room? Fred Krueger worked here. It's an old power- plant - a steam generator!
Here.
What's this?
So, you feeling anything?
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
I thought you might be able to make a connection.
Any ghosts in here?
C'mon, cut it out.
C'mon, cut it out.
Well, what am I supposed to do?
Well, what am I supposed to do?
I don't know. Concentrate or some- thing.
I feel like a jerk.
Shhh. Just concentrate.
Anything?
Uh-uh. Wait...
Disappointed?
About what?
About what?
About not finding any bogey men?
About not finding any bogey men?
I'll get over it.
Yeah?
Maybe it only happens when you're sleeping - that's the way it was with Nancy, wasn't it?
Maybe it only happens when you're sleeping - that's the way it was with Nancy, wasn't it?
Now, there's an idea we can take off on. Maybe we should drive out to the beach tonight and lay out a couple of blankets and... Until I fall asleep.
Now, there's an idea we can take off on. Maybe we should drive out to the beach tonight and lay out a couple of blankets and... Until I fall asleep.
Maybe we can do that. Strictly scientific, of course.
Nancy went bonkers from this thing. You wouldn't be afraid of being out on the beach with a potential lunatic?
Ghostbusters are fearless.
What is it - What's wrong?
Whoa!
Whoa!
What is it?
What is it?
I don't know - a sharp pain.
It's gone now.
Oh, Jesse...
Will you stop and tell me what's wrong?
I'm fine. Nothing's wrong.
I'm fine. Nothing's wrong.
you didn't say more than two words to me the whole way here. You had another nightmare, didn't you?
you didn't say more than two words to me the whole way here. You had another nightmare, didn't you?
yeah, I had a bad night.
yeah, I had a bad night.
You want to talk about it?
You want to talk about it?
My Dad thinks I'm on drugs, my Mom thinks I'm crazy and I'm not sure I don't agree with her.
You should eat something - you'll feel better.
I'm not hungry.
I'm not hungry.
I wish you'd talk to me. We can figure it out, you know. We can figure it out together.
I wish you'd talk to me. We can figure it out, you know. We can figure it out together.
There's nothing to figure out.
I think I better go. I'm just not into it tonight. I'm sorry.
Why won't you talk to me?
Why won't you talk to me?
Will you leave me alone? Please.
You're not being fair to me. I'm worried about you and I want to help you get through this thing.
What are you gonna do? How are you gonna help? I'm losing my mind. I don't want to have you watch me fall apart.
I'm afraid to go to sleep, I'm afraid to stay awake - I'm ruining your party. They're gonna put me away for sure.
We'll figure it out together. We'll stay up all night if we have to. I won't let anything happen to you.
Jesse, God - what happened?
I killed him! I killed him!
Oh, Christ, you're hurt...
I killed Grady. I killed Grady, Lisa. I killed Schneider. Oh my God, he's inside me...
Who, Jesse?
he's just waiting to take me. When I sleep.
he's just waiting to take me. When I sleep.
Who? Who's doing this to you?
Fred Krueger. He's been trying to get hold of me, to use me. He needs me to get out of his world into ours...He's gonna take me again.
No, Jesse. This isn't happening. It's gotta be everything you've taken in -- Schneider and the diary and the glove -- only it's all mixed up.
You created him - you can destroy him. He lives off your fear. Fight him, Jesse!
I can't!
Hi.
Hi.
What's so funny?
We must look like a couple of escapees from a veterans' hospital.
'Morning.
'Morning, honey.
Jess?
Huh?
Huh?
Eggs?
Oh...uh, no, just some milk, Mom.
You okay?
Yeah, I'm fine. Just really hot upstairs.
I know it's warm... I wish you'd call someone to check out the air conditioning, Ken.
So, school going alright?
Okay, I guess.
Okay, I guess.
Making friends?
Maybe we should call a doctor.
No. I'm okay.
I'm not taking drugs, Dad. Can I go to bed now?
Sure...go ahead.
Jesse, please, let's talk about this!
I'm okay. Just leave me alone.
Morning.
How'd you sleep, honey, okay?
How'd you sleep, honey, okay?
Fine.

If you get caught, I never saw you. Deal?
Deal. Thanks.

No, she's right.
I know who's trying to kill you.
Don't fucking humor us. We're not in the mood.

He wears a dirty brown hat. He's horribly burned. He has razors on his right hand.
So what do we do about this creep?
Last time, it was me against him. I wasn't strong enough...alone.
You didn't think we'd let you go alone?
No fuckin' way. We're a team.
Kincaid -- we should find the others first...
YOU'RE HOT STIT WITH A LITTLE MUTE KID -- LET'S SEE YOU TAKE A PIECE OF ME! KRUEGER!
What's happening?
He's close...
I'm glad things have worked out for you.

Yes. I'm going to see her tonight.
You pulled me in somehow, didn't you?
I -- I think so!
I used to live in this house.
But...it's just a house I've dreamed about. I dream about it all the time. Thank you for what you did last night.
Have you ever done that before? Pulled someone into your dream?
When I was a little girl. Three or four. If I had a nightmare, I'd bring my Dad in. The dream would always get better. He always used to tell me about it the next day -- he used to think they were his dreams. NANCY When did it stop?

Nancy? Would you sit with me awhile?
Sure.
You like gymnastics?

Freddy?
He's heavy in the halls...
Joey needs us. I can feel him.
How do we find him, Kristen?
What's that?
I don't know.
Nancy!
He's too strong! He was never this strong!
Kristen, can you pull us out?
They sedated me. We're stuck here till it wears off.

Are you okay?

Why is that?
Max, where's Kristen?
She's been waiting outside your office since breakfast.
Puttin' in soem late hours, I see. If you're trying for O.T., you're in the wrong place.
I just wanted to be here for the kids. how are they?
I just wanted to be here for the kids. how are they?
Restless. Very restless.
You need me, I'll be here all night.
Thanks, Max.
Save your breath, Ms. Thompson. Dr. Simms gave me specific instructions. Nobody gets to see Kristen -- especially you. She made that real clear.
But Max, she needs me. It could mean life or death.
I don't know...
It'll be my last chance. Pleese?
You got five minutes.
Thank you.
Nothing like a little cheery news to start the day.

Fred Krueger's dead. You always had a little trouble understanding that, Princess.
You know what he did. He's doing it again.
I think we can stop him this time. Stop him for good. But we need to know where the bones were hidden.
I lost too much over this already. I'm through with it.

Crossed over?
But I couldn't go until I told you how sorry I am for all the things I've done.
Tell me about the kids.

All I can say is this isn't something that's just going to disappear. you're all going to have to face it. Fight it. And if you're willing to work together... wiling to stand up to your deepest fears...I think we can beat it.

I'm running out of answers. A patient sleepwalks out of a security ward up to a tower with no access. A girl, alone in a room, dies by jumping six feet straight up into a television set. Nothing makes sense anymore.

Okay, we're going to try a little group hypnosis.
Take us there, Kristen.
Breathe deeply and relax...starting with your toes, relax everything until there's no tension left in your bodies. None at all. Keep following the pendulum...
We can try again.
Everybody take five.
We made it. Neil, we made it!
This isn't possible. And even if it is...what the hell am I doing here? Did you drag me in here too?
Take it slowly. Remember, this is a dream. Anything is possible.
Anything?
What are we going to do?
There's nothing we can do. It's out of our hands.
You're not going in. That's exactly what he wants. As long as you're on Hypnocyl, it's the only way he can get to you.

Oh Christ. Simms put Kristen in the Quiet Room for the night. They sedated her.
No...
Neil, it's no use. You saw how he is.
Just go. Kristen needs you. Keep her awake somehow. Do it.
I'm Taryn White. I only came here because it was a better deal than juvie hall. Also, I guess 'cause I'm going through some very stange shit.
Your dreams?
Your dreams?
Hey, everybody has bad dreams.
Who is he?
Freddy Krueger. He was a child murderer before he died. After he died, he became ...something worse. Six years ago Freddy killed my friends. He almost killed me. I thought I got rid of him -- but I guess he was too strong.
What'd you do, take the scenic route?
Sshhh. No time for that. Come on.
Okay, straight talk only in here.
What about Kristen?
What about Kristen?
We can't get to her. I've tried.
And you won't make any progress until you can recognize your dreams for what they are.
And what are they?
And what are they?
The by-product of guilt. Psychological scars steaming from moral conflicts and overt sexuality.
We'll begin sedation tonight. Starting with him.

Elizabeth, we don't need any outside help. I know these kids. I don't want some hot-shot taking chances with them just so she can get published.
Okay, Group's in session. Straight talk only in this room.
Today I'd like to start by getting us acquainted with our new staff member, Nancy Thompson. Let's make her feel welcome.
That's enough, Kincaid.
There will be no repeat occurences of last night's events. From now on, your doors will be locked during sleeping hours. We'll begin a policy of evening sedation. For everybody.
Elizabeth, I'm prescribing Hypnocyl. It's a dream suppressant.
I know what it is. I just can't believe what I'm hearing. What has she talked you into?

We're here.
Where...here?
I'm in.
Me too.
Hi.
Hi. Good Lord -- you're the spitting image of...
I wonder if you could tell me where the...?
Oh, it's just down the corridor on the right.
What do you think of the guinea fowl?
I'm a vegetarian.
I'm a vegetarian.
Oh God.
Lovely to meet you.

So I ask you when you're going to tell everyone, and you say...?

So tell me Anna -- what do you do?
I'm an actress.
I'm an actress.
Splendid. I'm actually in the stock- market, so not really similar fields, though I have done some amateur stuff -- P.G. Wodehouse, you know -- farce, all that. 'Ooh -- careful there, vicar.' Always imagined it's a pretty tough job, though, acting. I mean the wages are a scandal, aren't they?

Right. Right. So that's... fairly good. On the high side... have you tried the nuts?
No, thanks. I'll just look around.
Fine.
That book's really not good -- just in case, you know, browsing turned to buying. You'd be wasting your money.
Really?
Really?
Yes. This one though is... very good.
I think the man who wrote it has actually been to Turkey, which helps. There's also a very amusing incident with a kebab.
Thanks. I'll think about it.
Sorry about that...
No, that's fine. I was going to steal one myself but now I've changed my mind. Signed by the author, I see.

Nothing, nothing... Look, I live just over the street -- you could get cleaned up.
No thank you. I need to get my car back.
No thank you. I need to get my car back.
I also have a phone. I'm confident that in five minutes we can have you spick and span and back on the street again... in the non-prostitute sense obviously.
Okay. So what does 'just over the street' mean -- give it to me in yards.
Eighteen yards. That's my house there.
Would you like a cup of tea before you go?
No thanks.
No thanks.
Coffee?
Coffee?
No.
No.
Orange juice -- probably not.
Something else cold -- coke, water, some disgusting sugary drink pretending to have something to do with fruits of the forest?
Really, no.
Really, no.
Would you like something to nibble -- apricots, soaked in honey -- quite why, no one knows -- because it stops them tasting of apricots, and makes them taste like honey, and if you wanted honey, you'd just buy honey, instead of apricots, but nevertheless -- there we go -- yours if you want them.

No.
Do you always say 'no' to everything?
No. I better be going. Thanks for your help.
You're welcome and, may I also say... heavenly.
Thank you.
Yes. Well. My pleasure.
Oh hi. Forget something?
I forgot my bag.
I forgot my bag.
Oh right.
Here we go.
Thanks. Well...
I apologize for the 'surreal but nice' comment. Disaster...
Don't worry about it. I thought the apricot and honey business was the real lowpoint.
Probably best not tell anyone about this.
Right. No one. I mean, I'll tell myself sometimes but... don't worry -- I won't believe it.
Right. No one. I mean, I'll tell myself sometimes but... don't worry -- I won't believe it.
Bye.
Hello. Hi. Hi.
Hi.
Oh hi. It's William Thacker. We, ahm I work in a bookshop.
You played it pretty cool here, waiting for three days to call.
You played it pretty cool here, waiting for three days to call.
No, I've never played anything cool in my entire life. Spike, who I'll stab to death later, never gave me the message.

Oh -- Okay.
Oh -- Okay.
Perhaps I could drop round for tea or something?
Perhaps I could drop round for tea or something?
Yeh -- unfortunately, things are going to be pretty busy, but... okay, let's give it a try. Four o'clock could be good.
Yeh -- unfortunately, things are going to be pretty busy, but... okay, let's give it a try. Four o'clock could be good.
Right. Great. Classic. Classic.
Hi.
Hello.
Hello.
I brought these, but clearly...
Sorry about not ringing back. The whole two-names concept was totally too much for my flatman's pea-sized intellect.
No, it's a stupid privacy thing. I always choose a cartoon character -- last time out, I was Mrs. Bambi.
Right. Ahm... the film's great... and I just wondered -- whether you ever thought of having more... horses in it?
Ahm -- well -- we would have liked to -- but it was difficult, obviously, being set in space.
Ahm -- well -- we would have liked to -- but it was difficult, obviously, being set in space.
Obviously. Very difficult.
I'm sorry -- I arrived outside -- they thrust this thing into my hand -- I didn't know what to do.
No, it's my fault, I thought this would all be over by now. I just wanted to sort of apologize for the kissing thing. I seriously don't know what got in to me. I just wanted to make sure you were fine about it.
No, it's my fault, I thought this would all be over by now. I just wanted to sort of apologize for the kissing thing. I seriously don't know what got in to me. I just wanted to make sure you were fine about it.
Absolutely fine about it.
I'm just a complete moron. Sorry. This is the sort of thing that happens in dreams -- not in real life. Good dreams, obviously -- it's a dream to see you.
And what happens next in the dream?
Are you busy tonight?
Yes.
Well, it was nice to meet you. Surreal but nice.
Thank you. You are 'Horse and Hound's' favorite actress. You and Black Beauty. Tied.
Ahm. That thing I was doing tonight -- I'm not doing it any more. I told them I had to spend the evening with Britain's premier equestrian journalist.
Oh well, great. Perfect. Oh no -- shittity brickitty -- it's my sister's birthday -- shit -- we're meant to be having dinner.
Oh well, great. Perfect. Oh no -- shittity brickitty -- it's my sister's birthday -- shit -- we're meant to be having dinner.
Okay -- fine.
Okay -- fine.
But no, I'm sure I can get out of it.
But no, I'm sure I can get out of it.
No, I mean, if it's fine with you, I'll, you know, be your date.
No, I mean, if it's fine with you, I'll, you know, be your date.
You'll be my date at my little sister's birthday party?
You'll be my date at my little sister's birthday party?
If that's all right.
If that's all right.
I'm sure it's all right. My friend Max is cooking and he's acknowledged to be the worst cook in the world, but you know, you could hide the food in your handbag or something.
I'm sure it's all right. My friend Max is cooking and he's acknowledged to be the worst cook in the world, but you know, you could hide the food in your handbag or something.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
You'll have to prove it. This is a great brownie and I'm going to fight for it. State your claim.
Well, I've been on a diet since I was nineteen, which means basically I've been hungry for a decade. I've had a sequence of not nice boyfriends -- one of whom hit me: and every time my heart gets broken it gets splashed across the newspapers as entertainment. Meantime, it cost millions to get me looking like this...
Floppy, huh?
It's the hair! It's to do with the hair.

You know, I'm not sure. I don't think they'd tried for kids before, as fate would have it.
Too complicated.
That's fine.
That's fine.
Busy tomorrow?
Busy tomorrow?
I thought you were leaving.
I thought you were leaving.
I was.
Gardens. All these streets round here have these mysterious communal gardens in the middle of them. They're like little villages.
Let's go in.
Let's go in.
Ah no -- that's the point -- they're private villages -- only the people who live round the edges are allowed in.

You abide by rules like that?

Whoopsidaisies.
What did you say?
What did you say?
Nothing.
Nothing.
Yes, you did.
Yes, you did.
No, I didn't.
No, I didn't.
You said 'whoopsidaisies.'
I don't think so. No one has said 'whoopsidaisies,' do they -- I mean unless they're...
There's no 'unless.' No one has said "whoopsidaisies" for fifty years and even then it was only little girls with blonde ringlets.
There's no 'unless.' No one has said "whoopsidaisies" for fifty years and even then it was only little girls with blonde ringlets.
Exactly. Here we go again.
It's a disease I've got -- it's a clinical thing. I'm taking pills and having injections -- it won't last long.
Step aside.
So who left who?
She left me.
She left me.
Why?
Why?
She saw through me.
She saw through me.
Uh-oh. That's not good.
I'm sorry.
No, that's fine. I love that you tried... time was I'd have done the same.
I shouldn't have done that. I shouldn't have done that.
No, you were brilliant

I'm rash and I'm stupid and what am I doing with you?

I don't know, I'm afraid.

I don't know either.
Here we are. Do you want to come up?
There seem to be lots of reasons why I shouldn't.

To be able to do that is such a wonderful thing.
You've got to go.
You've got to go.
Why?
Why?
Because my boyfriend, who I thought was in America, is in fact in the next room.
Because my boyfriend, who I thought was in America, is in fact in the next room.
Your boyfriend?
-- this is a fairly strange reality to be faced with. To be honest, I don't realize...
I'm sorry... I don't know what to say.
I'm sorry... I don't know what to say.
I think goodbye is traditional.
Hi. Can I come in?
Come in.
I don't know where to go. The hotel is surrounded.
This is the place.
This is the place.
Thank you. I'm just in London for two days -- but, with your papers, it's the worse place to be.
These are such horrible pictures. They're so grainy... they make me look like...
Don't think about it. We'll sort it out. Now what would you like -- tea ... bath...?
Don't think about it. We'll sort it out. Now what would you like -- tea ... bath...?
A bath would be great.
I'm really sorry about last time. He just flew in -- I had no idea -- in fact, I had no idea if he'd ever fly in again.
No, that's fine. It's not often one has the opportunity to adios the plates of a major Hollywood star. It was a thrill for me. How is he?
No, that's fine. It's not often one has the opportunity to adios the plates of a major Hollywood star. It was a thrill for me. How is he?
I don't know. It got to the point where I couldn't remember any of the reasons I loved him. And you... and love?

Well, there's a question -- without an interesting answer.

Oh no no -- no.
Just anytime I've tried to keep things normal with anyone normal -- it's been a disaster.
I appreciate that absolutely. Is that the film you're doing?

'Message from command. Would you like them to send in the HKs?'
'No, turn over 4 TRS's and tell them we need radar feedback before the KFT's return at 19 hundred -- then inform the Pentagon that we'll be needing black star cover from ten hundred through 12.15' -- and don't you dare say one word about how many mistakes I made in that speech or I'll pelt you with olives.

And I think the book is the poorer for it.

No. What's that?

Big feet -- large shoes.
The thing that's so irritating is that now I'm so totally fierce when it comes to nudity clauses.
You actually have clauses in your contact about nudity?

Definitely. 'You may show the dent at the top of the artist's buttocks -- but neither cheek. In the event of a stunt person being used, the artist must have full consultation.'

Well, thank you. Anyway -- time for bed. Or... sofa-bed.
Well, thank you. Anyway -- time for bed. Or... sofa-bed.
Right.
Oh please sod off.
Okay.
Okay.
No! No. Wait. I... thought you were someone else. I thought you were Spike. I'm delighted you're not.
Wow.
What?
It still strikes me as, well, surreal, that I'm allowed to see you naked.
You and every person in this country.

Oh God yes -- I'm sorry.

Rita Hayworth used to say -- 'they go to bed with Gilda -- they wake up with me.' Do you feel that?

Oh.
Can I stay a bit longer?
Stay forever.
Stay forever.
Damn, I forgot the jam.
What?
Don't ask.
Oh my God. And they got a photo of you dressed like that?
Undressed like this, yes.
Undressed like this, yes.
Jesus.
How are you doing?
How do you think I'm doing?
How do you think I'm doing?
I don't know what happened.
I don't know what happened.
I do. Your furry friend thought he'd make a buck or two telling the papers where I was.
That's not true.
Really? The entire British press just woke up this morning and thought 'Hey -- I know where Anna Scott is. She's in that house with the blue door in Notting Hill.' And then you go out in your goddamn underwear.
This is such a mess. I come to you to protect myself against more crappy gossip and now I'm landed in it all over again. For God's sake, I've got a boyfriend.
You do?
As far as they're concerned I do. And now tomorrow there'll be pictures of you in every newspapers from here to Timbuktu.
I know, I know -- but... just -- let's stay calm...
I know, I know -- but... just -- let's stay calm...
You can stay calm -- it's the perfect situation for you -- minimum input, maximum publicity. Everyone you ever bump into will know. 'Well done you -- you slept with that actress -- we've seen the pictures.'
You can stay calm -- it's the perfect situation for you -- minimum input, maximum publicity. Everyone you ever bump into will know. 'Well done you -- you slept with that actress -- we've seen the pictures.'
That's spectacularly unfair.
That's spectacularly unfair.
Who knows, it may even help business. Buy a boring book about Egypt from the guy who screwed Anna Scott.
Now stop. Stop. I beg you -- calm down. Have a cup of tea.
I don't want a goddamn cup of tea. I want to go home.
And remember -- Spike owes you an expensive dinner. Or holiday -- depending if he's got the brains to get the going rate on betrayal.
That's not true. And wait a minute... this is crazy behavior. Can't we just laugh about this? Seriously -- in the huge sweep of things, this stuff doesn't matter.
You're right: of course, you're right. It's just that I've dealt with this garbage for ten years now -- you've had it for ten minutes. Our perspectives are different.
I mean -- today's newspapers will be lining tomorrow's waste paper bins.
I mean -- today's newspapers will be lining tomorrow's waste paper bins.

Well, you know -- it's just one day. Today's papers will all have been thrown away tomorrow.
Well, you know -- it's just one day. Today's papers will all have been thrown away tomorrow.
You really don't get it. This story gets filed. Every time anyone writes anything about me -- they'll dig up these photos. Newspapers last forever. I'll regret this forever.
This is certainly... ah...
I only found out you were here yesterday.
I only found out you were here yesterday.
I was going to ring... but... I didn't think you'd want to...
It's not going very well -- and it's our last day.
Absolutely -- you're clearly very busy.

But... wait... there are things to say.

You disappeared.

Yes -- I'm sorry -- I had to leave... I didn't want to disturb you.
Yes -- I'm sorry -- I had to leave... I didn't want to disturb you.
Well... how have you been?
Well... how have you been?
Fine. Everything much the same. When they change the law Spike and I will marry immediately. Whereas you... I've watched in wonder. Awards, glory ...
Fine. Everything much the same. When they change the law Spike and I will marry immediately. Whereas you... I've watched in wonder. Awards, glory ...
Oh no. It's all nonsense, believe me. I had no idea how much nonsense it all was -- but nonsense it all is... Well, yesterday was our last day filming and so I'm just off -- but I brought you this from home, and...
I thought I'd give it to you.
Thank you. Shall I...
Thank you. Shall I...
No, don't open it yet -- I'll be embarrassed.
No, don't open it yet -- I'll be embarrassed.
Okay -- well, thank you. I don't know what it's for. But thank you anyway.
Okay -- well, thank you. I don't know what it's for. But thank you anyway.
I actually had it in my apartment in New York and just thought you'd... but, when it came to it, I didn't know how to call you... having behaved so... badly, twice. So it's been just sitting in the hotel. But then... you came, so I figured... the thing is... the thing is ...

What's the thing?
You were saying...
Yes. The thing is... I have to go away today but I wondered, if I didn't, whether you might let me see you a bit... or, a lot maybe... see if you could... like me again.
But yesterday... that actor asked you who I was... and you just dismissed me out of hand... I heard -- you had a microphone... I had headphones.
You expect me to tell the truth about my life to the most indiscreet man in England?
Sorry about that.
That's fine. There's always a pause when the jury goes out to consider its verdict.
... can I just say 'no' to your kind request and leave it at that?
... Yes, that's fine. Of course. I... you know... of course... I'll just... be getting along then... nice to see you.
... Yes, that's fine. Of course. I... you know... of course... I'll just... be getting along then... nice to see you.
The truth is...
... with you, I'm in real danger. It took like a perfect situation, apart from that foul temper of yours -- but my relatively inexperienced heart would, I fear, not recover if I was once again ... cast aside, which I would absolutely expect to be. There are too many pictures of you everywhere, too many films. You'd go and I'd be... well, buggered,
I see. That reality is a real 'no,' isn't it?
I see. That reality is a real 'no,' isn't it?
I live in Notting Hill. You live in Beverly Hills. Everyone in the world knows who you are. My mother has trouble remembering my name.
I live in Notting Hill. You live in Beverly Hills. Everyone in the world knows who you are. My mother has trouble remembering my name.
Okay. Fine. Fine. Good decision.
I hoped there might be -- but no, I'm assured there aren't.
And what would you say...
Yes, I'm pretty sure I would.
That's very good news. The readers of 'Horse and Hound' will be absolutely delighted.
Yes...
Who is it?
Really -- don't do that -- I'm sure this is not his job.
I'm sorry. Is this a problem?
Thank you, Bernie. Hey -- nice surprise, or nasty surprise?
Nice surprise.
Liar. She hates surprises. What are you ordering?
I haven't decided.
I haven't decided.
Well, don't over-do it. I don't want people saying, 'There goes that famous actor with the big, fat girlfriend."
Excuse me.
Yes.
Yes.
Can I have your autograph?
Can I have your autograph?
What's your name?
What's your name?
Rufus.
What does it say?
Well, that's the signature -- and above, it says 'Dear Rufus -- you belong in jail.'
Well, that's the signature -- and above, it says 'Dear Rufus -- you belong in jail.'
Nice one. Would you like my phone number?
Nice one. Would you like my phone number?
Tempting but... no, thank you.
Can I just say, I thought 'Ghost' was a wonderful film.
Is that right?
Is that right?
Yes... I've always wondered what Patrick Swayze is like in real life.
Yes... I've always wondered what Patrick Swayze is like in real life.
I can't say I know Patrick all that well.
I can't say I know Patrick all that well.
Oh dear. He wasn't friendly during the filming?
Oh dear. He wasn't friendly during the filming?
Well, no -- I'm sure he was friendly -- to Demi Moore -- who acted with him in 'Ghost.'
He's bringing a girl?
Miracles do happen.
Miracles do happen.
Does the girl have a name?
Does the girl have a name?
He wouldn't say.
He wouldn't say.
Christ, what is going on in there?
That's right.
And this is William.
Where are you going?
Down Kensington Church Street, then Knightsbridge, then Hyde Park Corner.
Down Kensington Church Street, then Knightsbridge, then Hyde Park Corner.
Crazy. Go along Bayswater...
Quickly, quickly -- talk very quickly what are you doing here with Anna Scott?
Anna Scott?
Anna Scott?
Yes.
Yes.
The movie star?
The movie star?
Yup.
Yup.
Oh God. Oh God. Oh Goddy God.
No. Not true...
C'est la vie... We're lucky in lots of ways, but... Surely it's worth a brownie.
I just want to say to Tony -- don't take it personally. The more I think about things, the more I see no rhyme or reason in life -- no one knows why some things work out, and some things don't -- why some of us get lucky -- and some of us...
... get fired.
... get fired.
No!
No!
Yes, they're shifting the whole outfit much more towards the trading side -- and of course... I was total crap.
Hiya -- sorry -- the guinea fowl is proving more complicated than expected.
He's cooking guinea fowl?
He's cooking guinea fowl?
Don't even ask.
Bella -- this is Anna.
Right.
Still loves you though.
In a depressingly asexual way.
In a depressingly asexual way.
I never fancied you much actually...
I mean I loved you -- you were terribly funny. But all that kissing my ears...
Oh no -- this is just getting worse. I am going to find myself, 30 years from now, still on this couch.
Oh no -- this is just getting worse. I am going to find myself, 30 years from now, still on this couch.
Do you want to stay?
Do you want to stay?
Why not -- all that awaits me at home is a masturbating Welshman.
Good decision. All actresses are mad as snakes.
Tony -- what do you think?
This painting isn't the original, is it?
Yes, I think that one may be.
Bernie.
Well, obviously it's me, isn't it -- I work in the City in a job I don't understand and everyone keeps getting promoted above me. I haven't had a girlfriends since... puberty and, well, the long and short of it is, nobody fancies me, and if these cheeks get any chubbier, they never will.
But she said she wanted to go out with you?
Yes -- sort of...
Yes -- sort of...
That's nice.
That's nice.
What?
What?
Well, you know, anybody saying they want to go out with you is... pretty great... isn't it...
Well, you know, anybody saying they want to go out with you is... pretty great... isn't it...
It was sort of sweet actually -- I mean, I know she's an actress and all that, so she can deliver a line -- but she said that she might be as famous as can be -- but also... that she was just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her.
Bloody hell, this is fun.
Is Miss Scott staying here?
Hello, Bernie.
I'm sorry I'm so late. Bollocksed up at work again, I fear. Millions down the drain.
Bernie -- this is Anna.
Hello, Anna. Delighted to meet you.
Having you here, Anna, firmly establishes what I've long suspected, that we really are the most desperate hot of under-achievers.
Shame!
Shame!
I'm not saying it's a bad thing, in fact, I think it's something we should take pride in. I'm going to give the last brownie as a prize to the saddest act here.
If anyone gets in our way -- we have small nuclear devices.
And we intend to use them!
And we intend to use them!
Where's Bella?
Is this your first film?
No -- it's my 22nd.

Of course it is. Any favourite among the 22?

Of course. And is he your favourite Italian film director?
By the way -- it's you.
Me?

Yes. What do you think?
Yes. What do you think?
Well, yes. Groovy.

William has just turned down Anna Scott.
William has just turned down Anna Scott.
You daft prick!
What happened?
It was good.
Hi guys. Oh holy fuck.
Hun -- this is Anna. Anna -- this is Honey -- she's my baby sitter.
Have we got something for you. Something which will make you love me so much you'll want to hug me every single day for the rest of my life.
Blimey. What's that?
Blimey. What's that?
The phone number of Anna Scott's agent in London and her agent in New York. You can ring her. You think about her all the time -- now you can ring her!

Well, thanks, that's great.
Well, thanks, that's great.
It is great, isn't it. See you tonight. Hey, Marty-- sexy cardy.
What do you think? Good move?
Good move: when all is said and done, she's nothing special. I saw her taking her pants off and I definitely glimpsed some cellulite down there.
Ahm... room service.
How you doing? I thought you guys all wore those penguin coats.

Right.
Ah -- no. It's fine.
What's your name?
What's your name?
Ahm... Bernie.
I agree.
I'm sorry. I didn't get down what magazines you're from.
'Horse and Hound.' The name's William Whacker. I think she might be expecting me.
Okay -- take a seat. I'll check.
If you'd like to come with me we can rush you through the others.
The others?
The others?
Mr. Thacker's from 'Horse and Hound.'
Mr. Thacker?
Yes?
Yes?
Have you got a moment?
Are you a fan of Henry James?
This is Henry James film?
Pleased to meet you. Did you like the film?
Ah... yes, enormously.

Ahm right, right, I liked the bit in space very much. Did you enjoy making that bit?
Classic. Absolutely classic. Profit from major sales push -- minus ?347.
Shall I go get a cappuccino? Ease the pain.
Shall I go get a cappuccino? Ease the pain.
Yes, better get me a half. All I can afford.
Cappuccino as ordered.
Thanks. I don't think you'll believe who was just in here.
Thanks. I don't think you'll believe who was just in here.
Who? Someone famous?
Would be exciting if someone famous did come into the shop though, wouldn't it? Do you know -- this is pretty incredible actually -- I once saw Ringo Starr. Or at least I think it was Ringo. It might have been that broke from 'Fiddler On The Roof,' Toppy.
Topol.
Topol.
That's right -- Topol.
That's right -- Topol.
But Ringo Starr doesn't look anything like Topol.

No, well... he was quite a long way away.

Right. It's not a classic anecdotes, is it?

Not classic, no.
Right -- want another one?
Yes. No, wait -- let's go crazy -- I'll have an orange juice.
Martin -- your customer.
Can I help you?
I have to disturb you when you're cooking the books, but there's a delivery.
Martin, can't you just deal with this yourself?
Martin, can't you just deal with this yourself?
But it's not for the shop. It's for you.
But it's not for the shop. It's for you.
Okay. Tell me, would I have to pay a wet rag as much as I pay you?
Excuse me -- it's your mother on the phone.
Can you tell her I'll ring her back.
Can you tell her I'll ring her back.
I actually tried that tack -- but she said you said that before and it's been twenty-four hours, and her foot that was purple is now a sort of blackish color...
I actually tried that tack -- but she said you said that before and it's been twenty-four hours, and her foot that was purple is now a sort of blackish color...
Okay -- perfect timing as ever -- hold the fort for a second will you, Martin?
Max. This is Anna.
Hello, Anna ahm... Scott -- have some wine.
You haven't slept with her, have you?
That is a cheap question and the answer is, of course, no comment.
That is a cheap question and the answer is, of course, no comment.
'No comment' means 'yes.'

No, it doesn't.
No, it doesn't.
Do you ever masturbate?
Do you ever masturbate?
Definitely no comment.
Definitely no comment.
You see -- it means 'yes.'
So I get the brownie?
I think you do, yes.
You didn't know she had a boyfriend?
No -- did you?
Bloody hell, I can't believe it -- my whole life ruined because I don't read 'Hello' magazine.
Let's face facts. This was always a no-go situation. Anna's a goddess and you know what happens to mortals who get involved with the gods.

Every time. But don't despair -- I think I have the solution to your problems.
Really?
Well?
She's perfect, perfect.
I think you have forgotten... what an unusual situation you have here -- to find someone you actually love, who'll love you -- the chances are... always miniscule. Look at me -- not counting the American -- I've only loved two girls in my whole life, both total disasters.
That's not fair.
That's not fair.
No really, one of them marries me and then leaves me quicker than you can say Indiana Jones -- and the other, who seriously ought to have known better, casually marries my best friend.
Wait a minute -- I'm your brother and I don't know anything about this.
Is it someone we know?
Any more announcements?
Yes -- I feel I must apologize to everyone for my behavior for the last six months. I have, as you know, been slightly down in the mouth.

Don't give a damn about the famous girl.

No, don't think I do.
No, don't think I do.
Which means you won't be distracted by the fact that she's back in London, grasping her Oscar, and to be found filming most days on Hampstead Heath.
Oh God no.
So not over her, in fact.
Absolutely. Never trust a vegetarian.
Great. Excellent. Thanks.
Hello.
May I help you, sir?
May I help you, sir?
Ahm, look this is a very odd situation. I'm a friend of Anna Scott's -- and she rang me at home the day before yesterday -- and left a message saying she's staying with you...

I'm sorry, we don't have anyone of that name here, sir.
I'm sorry, we don't have anyone of that name here, sir.
No, that's right -- I know that. She said she's using another name -- but the problem is she left the message with my flatmate, which was a serious mistake.
Yes, sir. I have him in my mind.
And then double it -- and that is the -- what can I say -- git I'm living with and he cannot remember...
No, sir.
How about Miss Flintstone?
How about Miss Flintstone?
No, sir.
No, sir.
Or Bambi... or, I don't know, Beavis or Butthead?
No, sir.
Right. Right. Fair enough. Thanks.
Can I help you?
Yes -- I was looking for Anna Scott...
Yes -- I was looking for Anna Scott...
Does she know you're coming?
Does she know you're coming?
No, no. She doesn't.
No, no. She doesn't.
I'm afraid I can't really let you through then, sir.

Oh right. I mean, I am a friend -- I'm not a lunatic but -- no, you basically...
Oh right. I mean, I am a friend -- I'm not a lunatic but -- no, you basically...
... can't let you through.
Even he. Hey, you couldn't help me with an incredibly important decision, could you?
This is important in comparison to, let's say, whether they should cancel third world debt?

What are the choices?
What are the choices?
Well... wait for it... First there's this one...
Yes -- might make it hard to strike a really romantic note.
Point taken.
Cool, huh?
Yes -- she might think you don't have true love on your mind.
Yes -- she might think you don't have true love on your mind.
Wouldn't want that... Okay -- just one more.
Well, yes, that's perfect. Well done.
Thanks. Great. Wish me luck.

Well, there you go. On for a video fest tonight? I've got some absolute classic.
Imagine -- somewhere in the world there's a man who's allowed to kiss her.
Yes, she is fairly fabulous.
Hey.
Hi...
Just incidentally -- why are you wearing that?
Ahm -- combination of factors really. No clean clothes...

Right. Vicious circle. And then I was like rooting around in your things, and found this, and I thought -- cool. Kind of spacey.
There's something wrong with the goggles though...
No, they were prescription, so I could see all the fishes properly.

So -- any messages?

Yeh, I wrote a couple down.

Two? That's it?
Two? That's it?
You want me to write down all your messages?
Who were the ones you didn't write down from?
Ahm let's see -- ahm. No. Gone completely. Oh no, wait. There was -- one from your mum: she said don't forget lunch and her leg's hurting again.
Ahm let's see -- ahm. No. Gone completely. Oh no, wait. There was -- one from your mum: she said don't forget lunch and her leg's hurting again.
Right. No one else?
Right. No one else?
Absolutely not.
What did she say?
Well, it was genuinely bizarre... she said, hi -- it's Anna -- and then she said, call me at the Ritz -- and then gave herself a completely different name.

Absolutely no idea. Remembering one name's bad enough...
Try 'Flintstone.'
What?

I think she said her name was 'Flintstone.'

Does 'Flintstone' mean anything to you?
Bollocks, bollocks, bollocks. Have you seen my glasses?
No, 'fraid not.
No, 'fraid not.
Bollocks. This happens every time I go to the cinema. Average day, my glasses are everywhere -- everywhere I look, glasses. But the moment I need them they disappear. It's one of life's real cruelties.

Oh shit, is that the time? I have to go.
Thanks for your help on the glasses thing.
You're welcome. Did you find them?
You're welcome. Did you find them?
Sort of.
Well, okay. There's this girl...
Aha! I'd been getting a female vibe. Good. Speak on, dear friend.
Aha! I'd been getting a female vibe. Good. Speak on, dear friend.
She's someone I just can't -- someone who... self-evidently can't be mine -- and it's as if I've taken love-heroin -- and now I can't even have it again. I've opened Pandora's box. And there's trouble inside.
I don't mention that Anna's a vegetarian, did I?
I have some parsnip stew from last week. If I just peel the skin off, it'll be perfect.
Oh my God... Hello.
Hello. I wonder if I could have a little word.
Spike.
I don't want to interfere, or anything ... but she's split up from her boy- friend, that's right isn't it?

No -- you're right.
No -- you're right.
I'll talk to you in the morning.
I'll talk to you in the morning.
Okay -- okay. Might be too late, but okay.
I wouldn't go outside.
Why not?
Why not?
Just take my work for it.
I went out in my goddamn underwear too.
Get out, Spike. I'm so sorry.
What he's going to say next is -- there are people starving in the Sudan.
Well, there are. And we don't need to go anywhere near that far. My best friend slipped -- she slipped down- stairs, cracked her back and she's in a wheelchair for the rest of her life. All I'm asking for is a normal amount of perspective.
Was it you?
I suppose I might have told one or two people down the pub.

Right -- let's talk about rent...
Right -- let's talk about rent...
Let me help. We don't want all this shit cluttering up our lives.
Which floor?
Three.
Are you sure you...?
Yes.
Yes.
Oh. Right.
No -- they're... for my grandmother. She's in a hospital nearby. Thought I'd kill two birds with one stone.
I'm sorry. Which hospital?
Do you mind me not saying -- it's a rather distressing disease and the name of the hospital rather gives it away.
Oh sure. Of course.
How was she?
Fabulous.
Fabulous.
Wait a minute -- she took your grandmother's flowers?
Excuse me.
Yes.
Yes.
Bad news.
Bad news.
What?

We've got a security camera in this bit of the shop.

Right -- well, then we have something of an impasse. I tell you what -- I'll call the police -- and, what can I say? -- If I'm wrong about the whole book-down-the-trousers scenario, I really apologize.
Right -- well, then we have something of an impasse. I tell you what -- I'll call the police -- and, what can I say? -- If I'm wrong about the whole book-down-the-trousers scenario, I really apologize.
Okay -- what if I did have a book down my trousers?
Okay -- what if I did have a book down my trousers?
Well, ideally, when I went back to the desk, you'd remove the Cadogan guide to Bali from your trousers, and either wipe it and put it back, or buy it. See you in a sec.
At the close of Friday's meeting, we were discussing Mister Harding's problem, concerning his wife... Mister Harding stated that his wife made him uneasy because she drew stares from men on the street. Is that correct, Mister Harding?
Yes, that's perfectly correct.
Yes, that's perfectly correct.
He also thinks he may have given her reason to seek sexual attention elsewhere, but he didn't say how. He has been heard to say to his wife, 'I hate you, I don't ever want to see you again. You've betrayed me.' So. Does anyone care to touch upon this further?
Am I to take it that there isn't a man among you who has an opinion concerning this matter? Mister Harding, you've stated on more than one occasion that you suspected your wife of seeing other men.
Yes, Miss Ratched, this is correct.
Yes, Miss Ratched, this is correct.
But you have no proof.
But you have no proof.
No, Miss Ratched...
No, Miss Ratched...
And yet you suspect her.

Yes, that is correct.
Yes, that is correct.
Why?
Why?
I can only speculate as to the reasons why.
I can only speculate as to the reasons why.
Have you ever speculated, Mister Harding, that you are impatient with your wife because she does not meet your mental requirements?
No secrets, Mister Harding. Let's get it all out in the open...
I mean, the other day you made an allusion to my wife and the possible sexual problems we might be having. I know that to be the case, but the way in which you broached it, if that's your idea of teaching me something...
Yes, Mister Harding?
Yes, thank you, Miss Ratched. Since our last meeting I have been reflecting, quite seriously, on the nature of my problem. Naturally, I'm referring to the capacity to obtain the necessary results in order to obtain... No, no. To personify the very existence of that relationship regardless of the function... Regardless of the function, we will confront the question of... Yes. Yes. The question
Yes, Mister Harding?
Is it true McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped yesterday?

No. Mister Harding, that is not true.

Yes, Billy?
I-I-I-I-I d-d-don't s-s-see how anyone could lu-lu-lu-love a man who t-t-t-talks the way he does.
Was it your idea to visit her on Sunday?
Y-y-y-yes...

Tell us about it...

I-I-I-I c-c-c-came over S-S-S Sunday m-m-m-morning after ch-ch-ch church and br-br-brought her s-s some flowers, and I s-s-said, I said, 'C-C-C-Celia, will you muh muh-muh-muh-muh...' till the girl broke out l-l-laughing.
What was it about her that disturbed you so, Billy?
I was in luh-love with her.
I was in luh-love with her.
Billy, were you afraid of her, or of her love?
You mean you don't want their votes to count, Billy!
I-I-I...
P-p-p-please du-du-du-don't t-t tell her, p-p-please...
You should have thought about that before you brought that woman in here!

Will you come with me, please.
Will you come with me, please.
Hold the fort down, will ya, fellas!
My name is Miss Ratched. I'm the head nurse here. You've already met Miss Pilbow and Aides Washington and Warren.
Yes, ma'am.
We do appreciate the way you have taken it upon yourself to meet the other patients.
Thank you, ma'am...
This is your bed. You may leave your things in that cabinet.
Yes, ma'am...

Yes, ma'am.

Yes. Now go along, Mister McMurphy. Go along.
Yes. Now go along, Mister McMurphy. Go along.
Yes, ma'am. Lead the way, Sam.
Mister McMurphy, this ward is a democratic community run by the patients and their votes, so you should feel at ease in your new surroundings to the extent you can freely discuss emotional problems in front of the patients and staff. However, the cardinal rule, and I must emphasize this: Everyone keeps their seat during the meeting!
Yeah, well, it just pains me somethin' awful to see a full growed man sloshing around in his own water...
Yeah, well, it just pains me somethin' awful to see a full growed man sloshing around in his own water...
Yes... We were discussing Mister Harding's problem with his wife. Now, who will start? Billy.
Mister McMurphy. Patients aren't allowed in here.
Sorry, ma'am.
Pardon me, ma'am, can I ask you somethin'?
Yes, Mister McMurphy?
Yes, Mister McMurphy?
How 'bout turning off that music for a while so a man can hear himself think?
How 'bout turning off that music for a while so a man can hear himself think?
That music is for everyone, Mister McMurphy.
Well, say, how 'bout easin' it down a bit so a man don't have to shout!
Mister McMurphy, there are old men here who couldn't hear the music at all if it were lower. That music is all they have, and I wish you wouldn't lean against the glass there, your hands are staining the window.
Sorry to have bothered you.
Not at all, Mister McMurphy...
That's all right, Miss Pilbow, if Mister McMurphy does not wish to take his medication orally, he may...
No, that's okay, ma'am. Down it goes.
Mister McMurphy, patients are not permitted to run around in towels.
I wanna report a robbery!

On this ward?

Yeah, some creep stole my cigarettes!

Oh, I had them removed.

Well, say. How 'bout springing a pack of cigarettes loose?

Yes, Mister McMurphy.
Right... I've been givin' some serious consideration to what you told me about the democratic something of this therapeutic community of ours, an' I got a few things I wanna get off my chest, before we get back to Harding's problem.

Please understand, the schedule has been set up for a delicately balanced reason that would be thrown into turmoil by a switch of routines.
Please understand, the schedule has been set up for a delicately balanced reason that would be thrown into turmoil by a switch of routines.
The hell with the schedule, you can get back to the schedule next week when the series is over. What I want is a vote on it right now!
Yes. Now was there anything else you wanted to discuss, Mister McMurphy?
No way.
That was the first time you attempted to commit suicide, wasn't it? You must try to talk about it, Billy.

That's right, buddy. And you want to know who pecks the first peck?
It's as simple as that. You've been on our ward six hours and have already simplified the work of Freud, Jung and Maxwell Jones in one grand analogy: it's a pecking party.
I'm not talking about Fred Yoong or Maxwell Jones, buddy, what I'm talkin' about is that crummy meeting and what that nurse did to you!

Gimme a cigarette!
No!
No!
Why not?
Why not?
I'm not running a charity ward...
Miss Ratched. Given all the conditions of that sublime relationship, coupled with the subsequent annihilation of all that I held to be sacred, mentally, physically and emotionally, the only thing that I can speculate on, at this late date, is how I will justify the very existence of my life, with or without my dear wife.

Yes, that may be so, but in making a careful study of your past record, along with your behavior since you arrived here, my feeling is that you are not mentally ill and it is going to be my recommendation that you be returned to Pendleton where they are better equipped to handle your case.

He is your husband, no?
Yes, but... He was having an affair.

Si.
She was your sister.
No, she wasn't my sister.
No, she wasn't my sister.
Your mother.
Your mother.
Of course not.
Of course not.
Your grandmother?
Your grandmother?
Look, she wasn't a relative, okay? I don't know who she is.
May I see your boarding pass, please?
I-- I must've misplaced it.
I-- I must've misplaced it.
I'm sorry, but without a boarding pass we can't let you on the plane.
Great. Because, like I said, until you find it, we can't let you on the plane.
You don't understand. The man I'm supposed to marry is on that plane.
You don't understand. The man I'm supposed to marry is on that plane.
Okay, ma'am, just a moment.
You didn't have that with you before. Prima non l'aveva con se.
It was late in arriving. But it's here now.
You ask what room he's in, okay?
Buona notte.
Excuse me?
Mr. Bradley left about a half hour ago. He said his plans had changed unexpectedly. Would you prefer an interior or exterior room?

He couldn't have checked out-- I was supposed to meet him here.
He couldn't have checked out-- I was supposed to meet him here.
I'm very sorry. Perhaps you misunderstood?
Nobody here has any idea which way he went?
Once they pay the bill, we don't usually follow them.
No... it's just very important that I find him, okay?
Why?
Why?
Because.
He said he thinks a woman he works with knows him. Her name's Anna. But she won't be in 'til tomorrow.
So. How do we get to Rome?
So, what's the story with your friend?
My friend has lost her fucking mind...
My friend has lost her fucking mind...
What's she doing?
She's trying to find out where she can rent a loudspeaker.
What for?
What for?
So she can drive through the streets of Rome paging the man of her dreams.
No, really. What's she doing?
Really. She thinks he's here. Even though she's never met him. Even though she's never laid eyes on him.

Seriously.
Were they pen pals?
No.
No.
Is he some kind of celebrity or something?
Is he some kind of celebrity or something?
No.
No.
Did he do some anonymous good deed for her?
There's this poem by Rilke, I don't remember the whole thing, but it's about that. About waiting for that person, and wondering if you'll ever find them. And the last line of it goes, "Who knows? Perhaps the same bird echoed through both of us, yesterday--
--separate, in the evening..."
--separate, in the evening..."
Yes.
My hair's kind of a mess, isn't it?
Your hair... is perfect.
But... just to be sure, maybe we ought to shatter each other's unrealistic images of perfection. You know, each of us admit something embarrassing about ourselves.
Okay. Good idea. You first.
What?...
I feel like I've been wandering in the desert for as long as I can remember. With nothing but emptiness around me, wind and sun... And suddenly, out of the blue, somehow I've found the oasis.
Oh, right. Dwayne. You're engaged to Dwayne?
It just happened. I didn't plan it. I was alone. And he was... there. But now everything's changed. I owe it to him to let him know. I need to tell him.

You're sure...
You're sure...
I've never been more sure of anything in my life.
Good.
Let's find a telephone.
