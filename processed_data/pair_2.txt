Good. Now the tenors. Fourth beat of the first measure - C. Con-fu-ta-tis. Second measure, fourth beat on D. Ma-le-dic-tis. All right?
Yes.
Yes.
Fourth measure, second beat - F. Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis, flam- mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis.
Now the orchestra. Second bassoon and bass trombone with the basses. Identical notes and rhythm. The first bassoon and tenor trombone -
Please! Just one moment.
It couldn't be simpler.
First bassoon and tenor trombone - what?

With the tenors.

Also identical?

Exactly. The instruments to go with the voices. Trumpets and timpani, tonic and dominant.
And that's all?
Oh no. Now for the Fire. Strings in unison - ostinato on all - like this.
Do you have me?
I think so.
I think so.
Show me.
That's wonderful!
Yes, yes - go on. The Voca Me. Suddenly sotto voce. Write that down: sotto voce, pianissimo. Voca me cum benedictis. Call me among the blessed.
C Major. Sopranos and altos in thirds. Altos on C. Sopranos above. Vo-ca, vo-ca me, vo-ca me cum be-ne- dic-tis.
Sopranos up to F on the second 'Voca'?
Sopranos up to F on the second 'Voca'?

Oh no. I'm not tired at all.

I was foolish. I thought you did not care for my work - or me. Forgive me. Forgive me!
Oh? Have I seen it?
I - I don't think you have, Herr Director. Not yet. I mean, it's quite n - Of course, I'll show it to you immediately.

I think you'd better.
You mean in Turkey?
Exactly.
Exactly.
Then why especially does it have to be in German?

Well not especially. It can be in Turkish, if you really want. I don't care.
What you think, Mozart, is scarcely the point. It is what His Majesty thinks that counts.
But, Your Majesty -
That will do, Herr Mozart!
Just let me tell you how it begins.
Mozart! Herr Mozart, may I have a word with you please. Right away.
Certainly, Herr Director.
Did you not know that His Majesty has expressly forbidden ballet in his operas?
Yes, but this is not a ballet. This is a dance at Figaro's wedding.
Yes, but this is not a ballet. This is a dance at Figaro's wedding.

But surely the Emperor didn't mean to prohibit dancing when it's part of the story.

It is dangerous for you to interpret His Majesty's edicts. Give me your score, please.
What are you doing, Herr Director?
Taking out what you should never have put in.
Can we see the scene with the music back, please?
Oh yes, certainly. Certainly, Herr Director!
What is this, Herr Chamberlain?
What is what?
What is what?
Why do I have to submit samples of my work to some stupid committee? Just to teach a sixteen-year-old girl.

Must I? Well, I won't! I tell you straight: I will not!
Herr Mozart -
May I just do that, Majesty? Show you how it begins? Just that?
I don't think it was really decided, Director.
Oh, German! German! Please let it be German.
My dear fellow, the language is not finally the point. Do you really think that subject is quite appropriate for a national theatre?
Why not? It's charming. I mean, I don't actually show concubines exposing their! their! It's not indecent! It's highly moral, Majesty. It's full of proper German virtues. I swear it. Absolutely!
Well done, Mozart. Really quite fine.
Baron!
Mozart -
Sire, only opera can do this. In a play, if more than one person speaks at the same time, it's just noise. No one can understand a word. But with music, with music you can have twenty individuals all talking at once, and it's not noise - it's a perfect harmony. Isn't that marvelous?

Mozart, music is not the issue here. No one doubts your talent. It is your judgment of literature that's in question. Even with the politics taken out, this thing would still remain a vulgar farce. Why waste your spirit on such rubbish? Surely you can choose more elevated themes?

Elevated? What does that mean? Elevated! The only thing a man should elevate is - oh, excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm stupid. But I am fed up to the teeth with elevated things! Old dead legends! How can we go on forever writing about gods and legends?

Because they do. They go on forever - at least what they represent. The eternal in us, not the ephemeral. Opera is here to ennoble us. You and me, just as much as His Majesty.

Can you recall no melody of mine? I was the most famous composer in Europe when you were still a boy. I wrote forty operas alone. What about this little thing?

He was murdered, Father! Mozart! Cruelly murdered.
It was incomprehensible. What was God up to? Here I was denying all my natural lust in order to deserve God's gift and there was Mozart indulging his in all directions - even though engaged to be married! - and no rebuke at all! Was it possible I was being tested? Was God expecting me to offer forgiveness in the face of every offense,
Did you try?
Did you try?
Every day. Sometimes for hours I would pray!
Yes, Father. Yes! So much for my vow of chastity. What did it matter? Good, patient, hard-working, chaste - what did it matter? Had goodness made me a good composer? I realized it absolutely then - that moment: goodness is nothing in the furnace of art. And I was nothing to God.
You cannot say that!

God's ways are not yours. And you are not here to question Him. Offer him the salt of penitence. He will give you back the bread of eternal life. He is all merciful. That is all you need to know.

All I ever wanted was to sing to Him. That's His doing, isn't it? He gave me that longing - then made me mute. Why? Tell me that. If He didn't want me to serve Him with music, why implant the desire, like a lust in my body, then deny me the talent? Go on, tell me! Speak for Him!

What?
His funeral - imagine it! The Cathedral, all Vienna sitting there. His coffin, Mozart's little coffin in the middle. And suddenly in that silence, music. A divine music bursts out over them all, a great Mass of Death: Requiem Mass for Wolfgang Mozart, composed by his devoted friend Antonio Salieri. What sublimity! What depth! What passion in the music! Salieri has been touched by

The only thing that worried me was the actual killing. How does one do that? How does one kill a man? It's one thing to dream about it. It's very different when you have to do it, with your own hands.
Why? Why? Why? Why add to your misery by confessing to murder? You didn't kill him.
I did.

No, Father. From now on no one will be able to speak of Mozart without thinking of me. Whenever they say Mozart with love, they'll have to say Salieri with loathing. And that's my immortality - at last! Our names will be tied together for eternity - his in fame and mine in infamy. At least it's better than the total oblivion he'd planned

Don't pity me. Pity yourself. You serve a wicked God. He killed Mozart, not I. Took him, snatched him away, without pity. He destroyed His beloved rather than let a mediocrity like me get the smallest share in his glory. He doesn't care. Understand that. God cares nothing for the man He denies and nothing either for the man He uses. He broke Mozart
I've just learned something that might be of interest to you, Herr Director.
Yes?

Mozart is writing a new opera. An Italian opera.

Excuse me - didn't His Majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera?

Yes, absolutely. Is there a ballet in Figaro?
Yes, absolutely. Is there a ballet in Figaro?
Yes, in the third act.
Bravo, Your Majesty!
Well done, Sire!
Well, actually, Sire, if you remember, we did finally incline to Italian.
Did we?
I know we banned this play, but frankly I can't remember why. Can you refresh my memory, Herr Director?
For the same reason, Herr Chamberlain, that it was banned in France.

Oh yes, yes. And that was?
Oh yes, yes. And that was?
Well, the play makes a hero out of a valet. He outwits his noble master and exposes him as a lecher. Do you see the implications? This would be, in a grander situation, as if a Chamberlain were to expose an Emperor.

Of course now. Right away, before I get any older.
Well, I don't know! I mean you're a delicious, delightful, delectable little bird, but don't you think you might be just a little tough?
Oh, I'm tender enough for you, my boy. I'm tender enough for you.
This is embarrassing, you know. You introduced Mozart to some of my friends and he's begging from practically all of them. It has to stop.
I agree, Baron.
I agree, Baron.
Can't you think of anyone who might commission some work from him? I've done my best. I got him to arrange some Bach for my Sunday concerts. He got a fee - what I could afford. Can't you think of anyone who might do something for him?

No, Baron, no. I'm afraid Mozart is a lost cause. He has managed to alienate practically the whole of Vienna. He is constantly drunk. He never pays his debts. I can't think of one person to whom I dare recommend him.

I tried to investigate the attack. There are no records. The case was closed and now they've 'misplaced' the file. David's lacerations were cleaned and dressed when he arrived here and yet supposedly no doctor examined him before I did. The Goodman boy is already in the ground so he's no good to us. So I went to the pub in East Proctor where

And what else?
I think the village of East Proctor is hiding some dark and terrible secret. I'm convinced that, like David, they believe in this werewolf.
You've absolutely no idea where David might be?
No. He knows no one in London, besides me. I shouldn't have left him alone.
Surely you're not suggesting...
David has suffered a severe trauma. I myself witnessed some form of mass neurosis in East Proctor. If all the villagers believe that Jack Goodman was killed by a werewolf, why shouldn't David? And then it follows that if he survived an attack by a werewolf, wouldn't he himself become a werewolf the next full moon?

Yes, go on.
Yes, go on.
Ahem, A Word of Explanation. It was in Warwick Castle that I came across the curious stranger whom I am going to talk about. He attracted me by three things: his candid simplicity, his marvelous familiarity with ancient armor, and the restfulness of his company - for he did all the talking. We fell together as modest people will in the tail of the

I'm off. There's food in the fridge.
See you later.
David! Where on earth have you been!?!
I'm freezing.
Alex, I've lost my mind. I woke up at the zoo! But you know what? I feel terrific!
The zoo?
The zoo?
Waking up at the zoo, that's not so insane. Having no clothes on? That's insane. What did I do last night, Alex?

Don't you remember?

I said goodbye to you. I was locked out of the flat. I climbed the wall and came in through the bathroom window. I started to read and then I was naked at the zoo! I guess I am out of my fucking mind.

I should be committed.

David, please be rational. Let's go to Dr. Hirsch.

We had an argument. He's being silly.

Has he been refusing food?

Nothing quite as dramatic as that, Miss Price. He just doesn't eat enough of what is put before him. He suffers from nightmares. I'd think he just needs a hand to hold.

Mr. Bringsly, I'm sorry. I have absolutely no idea what to say to you.
You've left my wife a widow and my children fatherless. And I understand that I am to walk the earth one of the living dead until the wolf's bloodline is severed and the curse lifted.
That's easy for you to say - you're already dead.
No, David. Harry and I and everyone you murder are not dead. The undead.
No, David. Harry and I and everyone you murder are not dead. The undead.
Why are you doing this to me?
Here, Gladys, Tom. Did you hear the one about the crashing plane?
No, but we're about to.
You be quiet, woman, and let me speak.
Quiet, everyone! Hush! Shhh!
All right, laugh then. I shan't tell it.
Oh, come on, tell us.
Oh, come on, tell us.
No. You've had your chance.
Oh, all right. There was this airplane over the Atlantic on its way to New York. It was full of men from the United Nations.
That's very funny, that is.
No one brought them here! No one wanted them here!
You could have told them!
Mr. Kessler? Wake up, please.
I was having a nightmare.
Now go back to sleep so you'll be fresh for Dr. Hirsch in the morning.
What time is it?

How long have I been here?
You've been unconscious since you were brought in two weeks ago.

You've suffered some rather severe cuts and bruises, lost a bit of blood, but nothing too serious; black and blue for a while. You'll have some dueling scars to boast of. That lunatic must have been a very fierce fellow. They say a mad man has the strength of ten.

Now we've just given you a pretty strong sedative, so try to get some rest now. Miss Price will see to your needs. Rest now.
There were witnesses?
So they said.

How could there have been witnesses? It was so dark. We were running and I fell and Jack went to help me up and this thing came from nowhere... I don't understand what they're talking about.

Doctor, my memory is fine. It's my sanity I'm beginning to worry about.
You've never had bad dreams before?
Sure, as a kid. But never so real. Never so bizarre.
Did you get a good look at the man who attacked you?
I've told you, it wasn't a man. It was an animal. A big wolf or something. A rabid dog.
I've told you, it wasn't a man. It was an animal. A big wolf or something. A rabid dog.

Look, Dr. Hirsch, I know I've been traumatized, but Jack was torn apart. I saw him. A man can't do that to someone with his bare hands.

Believe me. The Hound of the Baskervilles was an invention of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's. And if you'd read the bloody book, you'd find that Holmes discovered your house of hell a fraud, a fake.
Dr. Hirsch? I'd rather not be by myself.
Of course not, David. I'll fetch in young Miss Price.
Are you cold?

It's cold, David, and I'm so alone. The undead surround me. Have you ever talked to a corpse? It's boring! I'm lonely! Kill yourself, David, before you kill others.
You're not real.
Don't be an asshole, David. Come here.
What are you doing here?
I wanted to see you.

Okay, you've seen me. Now go away.

Hi, Jack.
Hi, David.
What can I say, Jack?
You don't have to say anything.
You don't have to say anything.
Aren't you going to say, 'I told you so'?

If I was still alive, I probably would.

You look awful.

Thank you.

I didn't mean it. I don't know what I'm saying. I'm not even sure it was me who killed those people. I don't remember doing it.

What about the zoo?

Well, even if I'm not the wolfman, I am crazy enough to do something like that. I mean, here I sit in Leicester Square talking to a corpse. I'm glad to see you, Jack.

I want you to meet some people.
David Kessler, this is Gerald Bringsly.
Hello.
Hello.
Gerald is the man you murdered in the subway. We thought it best you didn't see him as he's a fresh kill and still pretty messy.
Because this must be stopped.
How shall I do it?
I could hang myself.
If you did it wrong, it would be painful. You'd choke to death.
Dr. Hirsch?
Come in, come in. Please sit. Some tea?
No, thank you, Doctor.
Well, then, what can I do for Scotland Yard?
You were saying?
Has David Kessler anything to say concerning the attack on the moors?
Has David Kessler anything to say concerning the attack on the moors?
Why don't we ask him?
The forensic lads seem to feel that some sort of animal was involved, that's true, but I hardly think...
Regardless of what you think, Lieutenant, the fact remains that David is missing and that we must find him.
What can we do to assist you?
Stay here. If we need you, we'll know where to reach you.
Yes?
Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus are here to see you, Doctor.
Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus are here to see you, Doctor.
Send them in.
Excuse me. Yes?
Roger Mathison, Doctor.
Roger Mathison, Doctor.
What here?
What here?
He's on the telephone.
He's on the telephone.
Tell him I'm out. No, tell him I've passed away. An old war wound or something. Tell him I'm dead. And no more calls!
Hello, there. What can I get you?
Campari and soda would do nicely.
Campari and soda would do nicely.
Sorry, love.
Sorry, love.
I suppose Guinness will suffice.
What's that?
Oh, that's been there for two hundred years. We were going to paint it out, but it's traditional, so we left it.

I see. You've heard nothing about the incident?
Do you have any hot soup?
No.
Hot chocolate?
We've got spirits and beer. If it's something hot you want, you can have tea.

Then you have some hot tea?

No.
No.
Oh.
Oh.
But I can heat some up for you if you'd like.
Remember the Alamo?
I beg your pardon?
No, thank you.
I'd like some tea, please.
Sorry.
Has Mr. Kessler said anything regarding the attack on the moors?
He may have a point, Lieutenant. Two strong boys would be able to defend themselves against one man.
Sgt. McManus, are you suggesting that David and Jack were, in fact, attacked by some animal and that the officialdom of East Proctor has conspired to keep it a secret? We have an autopsy report on the murderer who was shot in the act by the local police. We have two witnesses to the crime. You'll forgive me, Mr. Kessler, if I consider your

Lieutenant, the boy seems pretty lucid to me and...
And what, Sergeant?
And what, Sergeant?
I don't rightly know, sir.
I don't rightly know, sir.
That is precisely my point. David, as far as we are concerned, the matter is closed. We won't trouble you any further. Good day.
I cannot accept a connection between David Kessler and last night's murders. We will find him, however. I can assure you of that.
We'll find him, not to worry.
Hello, Tom.
You here again? What do you want?
What do you suppose anybody wants? Money, money, money!
Listen, I told you I wasn't interested in that deal, didn't I?
Listen, I told you I wasn't interested in that deal, didn't I?
I want to know why .
Tom, I never had trouble getting credit from you before. When I was flat broke you gave me all the money I wanted. Now I come to you with a swell deal, and the greatest
I'll tell you why. I don't like the crowd you're mixed up with. Personally, you can have all the credit you want. But for that deal - not a cent.
I'll tell you why. I don't like the crowd you're mixed up with. Personally, you can have all the credit you want. But for that deal - not a cent.

What's the idea of turning her down? It sounds like a perfectly safe investment.
She's a widow. I don't like taking mortgages from widows.

Why not?
If she can't pay, I'll have to foreclose, won't I?
Yes - sure
Yes - sure
Yeah - sure!
Oscar, what's the matter?
I was the first one to see it. I was coming down the stairs, and there was the watchman lying dead at my feet.

Say Matt, I'll have to have some money for those Manville payrolls.
How much?

About twenty-four thousand.
About twenty-four thousand.
It was more than that last week.

Yeah.

Here's twenty-five thousand.
Say, do me a favor, will you Charlie?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Let me have ten bucks?

Ten bucks? Say, if I had ten bucks, I'd quit.
Ten bucks? Say, if I had ten bucks, I'd quit.
Charlie!
Charlie!
Yeah?
I'll pay it back to you Saturday - on the level I will. Give a guy a break, will you? I've got to get it back in my account. If Helen ever finds out that I
Baby, I can't give you anything but love...
Whose death?
It'll be yours if you don't kick in with that ten bucks.

Yeah.
And listen, wise guy - I'm setting friend time clock for exactly nine o'clock, so no squawks out of you guys in the morning.
Say, don't annoy me. I got troubles of my own.
Mr. Dickson in yet?
Not yet, Mr. Clark.
Not yet, Mr. Clark.
When he comes in, tell him we're waiting for him in the board room.
When he comes in, tell him we're waiting for him in the board room.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
And tell him not to delay.
And tell him not to delay.
Yes, sir.
Personally, I think you're getting panic-stricken about nothing. Dickson's all right.
Oh, is he? We carry more unsecured paper than any other institution in the city. We're fools to tolerate it.
Don't make me laugh, Schultz!
Dickson doesn't have to go. But he must agree to this merger with New York Trust
Dickson doesn't have to go. But he must agree to this merger with New York Trust
What good will that do?
What good will that do?
What good will that do? Why, it will take control away from him. We'll put somebody else in charge, call in all doubtful loans, and be on safe ground again. That's what good it will do!
How are you protecting your depositors? By making a lot of idiotic loans!
Take it easy, Clark.
You know Dickson as well as we do. He'll shut the doors before he gives up control.
All right, let him! I'm sick and tired of hearing about him. If he wants to run the bank, let him do it. I don't want any part of it.
Say, you know, I found out something yesterday about hitting a golf ball. You've got to hit with the left hand, and from the inside out, it's the only way you can hit anything
I think, Mr. Dickson, we would like to have a little of your very valuable time here at the bank this morning, if you don't mind.
I think, Mr. Dickson, we would like to have a little of your very valuable time here at the bank this morning, if you don't mind.
Oh, you would, eh? All right. If it's more important than golf, go ahead. What's on your mind?
What's the matter with my policy? How many losses has this bank taken in the last twenty-five years? I'll tell you. Not a single one! What's wrong with that kind of banking?
Just pure luck!
Character, hmmpf! That's your idea?
Not at all. That's Alexander Hamilton's idea[5] - the finest banking mind this country has ever known. Those are his exact words, gentlemen. Character! It's the only thing you can bank on, and it's the only thing that will pull this country out of the doldrums.
Most of the creditors I know personally. I've seen them grow up in the community. I knew their fathers and mothers before them.
I know, Dickson. That's all very well. But you're taking too many chances. In these times a bank should keep liquid in case of trouble. In case of emergency!
I'm running this bank my way. Get that clear!
Gentlemen, you notice Mr. Dickson refuses to consider our wishes. He refuses an offer to merge with the New York Trust - the only thing that will put this bank on safe ground. He insists upon running a bank on so flimsy a thing as . . . as faith!

Yes! You said it, Clark. That's the only thing that means anything to me.
We want to talk to you.
What about?
What about?
We'll discuss that in the board room.
We'll be forced to shut the doors. I've worked twenty-five years night and day to keep this bank alive. You've all made money out of it. Are you willing to help?
What do you mean, help?
What do you mean, help?
I know that among you, you have at least a million dollars in various banks throughout the city. Get that money over here and I'll stop this run within five minutes.

That sounds very simple, Dickson, but why should we jeopardize our personal fortunes?
That sounds very simple, Dickson, but why should we jeopardize our personal fortunes?
I have everything I own in it. It's your bank as well as mine, isn't it?
The depositors you were protecting were the first ones to pounce on you. You thought they were your friends. Why don't you go out there now and try and get some help from them?
Aw, they've gone crazy. You can't reason with a mob.
Aw, they've gone crazy. You can't reason with a mob.
No. You can't reason with anyone else when you're in a jam. We pleaded with you to keep liquid, but you wouldn't listen to us. You preached to us about faith and a lot of other rubbish. Now you want our help. You want us to throw a lot of cash into a bank that you've wrecked. All right. There's one way you can

So, that's it, eh? You've waited a long time for this chance, haven't you? Well, I'm not going to resign now - or ever.
Say, you can't do that
I can't? You just wait and see. If that run doesn't stop within the next hour, I'll shut the doors. You know what that means? The bank examiner will step in tomorrow. You'll be forced to liquidate. I'll insist upon it. The depositors will be paid one hundred cents on the dollar. What's left you gentlemen can have. But I'll guarantee there won't be
Dickson, I'd like to talk to you about the bank.
The bank. All right. Do anything you want with it.
Come out here you pawnbrokers - take a look at this!
We've been waiting fifteen minutes
We've been waiting fifteen minutes
You know what you can do with that! Come on, take a look at this! You'll see a demonstration of faith that's worth more than all the collateral in the world.
I hope you don't mind me asking you a few questions, Mr. Cluett.
Of course, yes. Just what would you like to know, Inspector?
Of course, yes. Just what would you like to know, Inspector?
Where were you at twelve o'clock last night?
Where were you at twelve o'clock last night?
That's very simple. I was home.
That is simple, isn't it? I assume you can prove that if necessary.
Oh yes, of course. There was someone with me. A lady.
Oh yes, of course. There was someone with me. A lady.
Looks like you're going to have no trouble at all. What was the lady's name, Mr. Cluett?
Looks like you're going to have no trouble at all. What was the lady's name, Mr. Cluett?
If you don't mind, Inspector, I'd rather not say - that is, unless it becomes absolutely essential. You see, she's married.

Stand back Inspector, or I'll shoot. Drop that gun.
All right, Jack, all right.
Don't be a fool, Cluett. This is only going to make it worse for you.
Stand back, Inspector. Let me out of here, or I'll shoot you!
What were you doing at Finlay's this morning?
They took my keys yesterday. I went there to get them back.
I was crazy, I tell you, Mr. Dickson. I didn't know what I was doing. I wandered around in a daze. All I could think of was that they were going to kill me . . . You'll stand by me, won't you, Mr. Dickson? You won't go back on me now, will you? I'll die if they send me to prison!
Don't forget there's a dead watchman downstairs.

He won't believe it, Mr. Dickson. But it's the truth - honest it is. I was in my apartment last night - ask your wife - she

I don't know. It's all been like a crazy nightmare, Mr. Dickson.

Nothing, nothing, Mr. Dickson. Don't pay any attention to me. I don't know what I'm saying.

You just mentioned her name. What was she doing there? What was she doing in your apartment?

She just came up for a drink. Just for a few minutes.
She wasn't to blame, Mr. Dickson. It wasn't her fault. Honest, it wasn't. I begged her to come up. She didn't
Get out, get out!
You know what we do to welchers, Cluett, don't you?

Please, please don't laugh at me, Phyllis. I must see you tonight!

What are you doing here?
Are the payrolls ready for tomorrow?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Let me see your cash book, will you?
Let me see your cash book, will you?
Now?
Now?
Yes, now.
The butler said I could stay. I told him it was important.
Oh, yeah?
Well, I thought I'd like to have a little talk with you.
I'm listening.
I'm listening.
It's funny - now that I'm here, I don't know just how to go about it. You see, I kind of expected to find you here alone.
Anything you have to say to me, you can say in the morning.
Oh no, Mr. Cluett, if it's all the same to you, I'd rather not wait. It's about you and Mrs. Dickson.
I'm not interested in what you think.
You've no right to do this to her, Mr. Cluett. Why don't you think it over? It's only gonna get you into a lot of trouble.
You've no right to do this to her, Mr. Cluett. Why don't you think it over? It's only gonna get you into a lot of trouble.
I tell you, I'm not interested in your opinion.
I tell you, I'm not interested in your opinion.
No? Then maybe you'll understand, Mrs. Dickson. Oh, gee, he's crazy about you. Nobody knows it better than you. If he ever finds out, it'll kill him.
Phyllis, you don't have to explain anything. You'd do well to mind your own business.
This is my business. Mr. Dickson's been like a father to me. What has he ever done to you to deserve a deal like this?
This is my business. Mr. Dickson's been like a father to me. What has he ever done to you to deserve a deal like this?
That will be just about enough! Now get out of here!
That will be just about enough! Now get out of here!
I guess I have said enough I'm just wasting my breath talking to you.
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
John, how's your wife this morning?
John, how's your wife this morning?
Much better this morning, thank you.
Much better this morning, thank you.
Got a handkerchief?
Excuse me
Wait a minute. How do you feel this morning?
Wait a minute. How do you feel this morning?
I'm feeling fine this morning.
I'm feeling fine this morning.
That makes it unanimous. I feel all right too.
That makes it unanimous. I feel all right too.
Thank you!
Shall we let the people come in?
Of course, let them in! You're late now.
Good morning, Mr. Dickson. My wife is much better this morning.
Well, that's too bad. Mine's all right too.
Well, look who's here! Hello, dear.
Hello, darling.
If this isn't a red-letter day for Tom Dickson! First I trample on the Board of Directors, then I promote Matt here to assistant cashier, and now to complete the day I have a visit from my sweet and lovely and gorgeous wife. What a man, what a man!
It's amazing that your sweet, lovely, gorgeous wife can ever get to see you.
It's amazing that your sweet, lovely, gorgeous wife can ever get to see you.
Oooh! That has the earmarks!
What's the matter dear? What have I done now?
Nothing. Tom, I thought you were going out with me tonight.
Nothing. Tom, I thought you were going out with me tonight.
Oh, I did have a date with you tonight, didn't I?
Oh, I did have a date with you tonight, didn't I?
Yes.
Yes.
I'm terribly sorry. I'd forgotten all about you. I'm so sorry, dear.
Now Tom, you simply cannot go to Philadelphia tonight. That's all there is to it.
But I have to go, dear. It's a very important banker's meeting.
But I have to go, dear. It's a very important banker's meeting.
I don't care whether it's important or not. You said you were going out with me, and if you hadn't promised so faithfully, I wouldn't have gone and planned the whole thing.
I don't care whether it's important or not. You said you were going out with me, and if you hadn't promised so faithfully, I wouldn't have gone and planned the whole thing.
Listen, it isn't so terribly important. We can go to the theatre any time.

You can take some of the girls. You can take Mildred - or Gwynn
You can take some of the girls. You can take Mildred - or Gwynn
The girls! I don't suppose it ever occurred to you that I might go out and find myself an attractive young man . . .
Ho! Ho! Ho!
Ho, ho, ho, yourself! I wouldn't laugh if I were you. You may not suspect it, but I'm still attractive - to some.
Ho, ho, ho, yourself! I wouldn't laugh if I were you. You may not suspect it, but I'm still attractive - to some.
Listen, don't go around being attractive to anyone but me . . .
Listen, don't go around being attractive to anyone but me . . .
Well . . .

Don't you forget that I'm still the head man around here too. Now we'll get the tickets changed for tomorrow night. You and I are going out together. How's that?
Don't you forget that I'm still the head man around here too. Now we'll get the tickets changed for tomorrow night. You and I are going out together. How's that?
Tomorrow night?
All right. I'll postpone the whole thing until tomorrow night.
Happy now?
Happy now?
No.
Listen, dear. I want to ask you something. I know it's a silly thing for me to ask you, but . . . I want you to tell me the truth. Where were you last night?
Last night? Er - why - uh, last night . . .
Last night? Er - why - uh, last night . . .
Listen, dear. Now tell me the truth about this. Were you in Cluett's apartment?
Listen, dear. Now tell me the truth about this. Were you in Cluett's apartment?
In Cluett's apartment? Well dear, you see, I . . . I . . .
Good morning.
Helen, you're becoming more beautiful every day. What are we going to do about it?
Helen, you're becoming more beautiful every day. What are we going to do about it?
I don't know.

Guess we'll just have to sacrifice the bank. When are you and Matt going to get married?

Directors, eh? Long faces?
Longer.
I haven't got any new stories for them this morning, either.
Helen, tell Matt I want to see him.
Yes, sir.
Oh, Mr. Dickson - they're going to arrest Matt. They think he did it!
Where is he now?
Where is he now?
In Mr. Sampson's office.
In Mr. Sampson's office.
Now don't you worry about it.
Come on in here, Helen. Bring your book. I want some numbers to try to get some action. Get Parker at the Union-Leeds - the Exchange . . . Winslow and old man Harris at the Home Mortgage. Snap into it, Helen. Just as quick as you can.
Yes, sir.
You want the rest of those numbers, Mr. Dickson?
Numbers? No, never mind.
Good morning, Helen.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Say, I know what's the matter with you. Matt!
Oh!
Oh, no! It's not for you. You're only going to get married. Mrs. Dickson and I are going to go on the honeymoon.
Yes?
Helen, I'm going to Philadelphia, just as soon as the bank closes. Make all the arrangements, will you?

Got my letter?
Got my letter?
Yes, thank you.
Yes, thank you.
Hello, Helen.
Mr. Dickson?
Ah, Mrs. Pembroke. I spoke to Mr. Schaffer at the Guaranty. He's going to take care of that mortgage for you . . .
But, Mr. Dickson, I thought you were going to take care of the mortgage. I only want ten thousand. The property is worth sixty.
Mr. Schaffer will take good care of you. He'll give you fifteen - maybe twenty . . .
Wait a minute. Where's your uniform?
I haven't any.
I haven't any.
You haven't got a uniform?
You haven't got a uniform?
No, sir.
No, sir.
My goodness, you ought to have a uniform. How much does one cost?
My goodness, you ought to have a uniform. How much does one cost?
Why, I don't know.
Why, I don't know.
You see Sampson. Tell him I sent you. You've got to have a uniform.
Oh, make that uniform blue.
Yes, sir.
Well, well, well - got your uniform, eh?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Looks good. How much did it cost?
Looks good. How much did it cost?
I don't know. Mr. Sampson bought it for me.
It's all right. Thanks.
And what's more, keep up the good work and who knows - some day you'll be the fellow sitting behind that desk . . . Not a bad thought, eh?
What's the matter? You don't seem very excited about it.
Sure, I think it's swell.
Sure, I think it's swell.
Say, come on. Show a little enthusiasm. What's the matter? Are you sick or something? Go on, fake it - even if it isn't real.
Aw, I'm sorry, Mr. Dickson. It's just kind of sudden, that's all. Sure, I'm excited. I think it's great. Only, well, you've done so much for me already . . . I'll never be able to thank you enough.
Aw, go on, forget it. You came through, didn't you? That's all I wanted. A lot of them didn't think you would. You don't know how much satisfaction it's been to me. It's been swell. Well, when are you and Helen going to get married?
Aw, go on, forget it. You came through, didn't you? That's all I wanted. A lot of them didn't think you would. You don't know how much satisfaction it's been to me. It's been swell. Well, when are you and Helen going to get married?
Well, I
Well, I
I suppose you want me to fix that up for you too, eh?
I already told him I was home.
There you are.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Matt, do you realize you're up against something? You're being charged with murder. It's serious, son. Now come on, I know you didn't do it. But we've got to make them believe it. Come on, tell the truth, where were you last night?
I can't tell you.
No. I won't.
You're protecting somebody.
You're protecting somebody.
No, I'm not Mr. Dickson!
No, I'm not Mr. Dickson!
Yes, you are. You're protecting somebody. Now listen, it doesn't make any difference who it is. It can't be as important as this. Now come on, tell me. Where were you last night? Come on, don't be a fool. Matt, you trust me, don't you?
We haven't got much time left, Mr. Dickson. We've got to do something quick or it'll be too late.
Why wouldn't you tell me where you were last night?
Why wouldn't you tell me where you were last night?
You're not giving up, are you, Mr. Dickson?
You're not giving up, are you, Mr. Dickson?
Were you in Cluett's apartment?

Oh, I can explain about that later. You're losing your bank - don't you realize what that means?
Oh, I can explain about that later. You're losing your bank - don't you realize what that means?
Was Mrs. Dickson there?
Was Mrs. Dickson there?
Listen, Mr. Dickson, don't let them lick you just because a couple of big shots turned you down. You've got more friends than anybody in this town. Little guys - guys who wouldn't be in business if it weren't for you. All you've got to do is
Listen, Mr. Dickson, don't let them lick you just because a couple of big shots turned you down. You've got more friends than anybody in this town. Little guys - guys who wouldn't be in business if it weren't for you. All you've got to do is
Wait a minute. Answer my question. Was Mrs. Dickson there?
Wait a minute. Answer my question. Was Mrs. Dickson there?
Well . . . uh . . . I . . .

She was, wasn't she? How long has this been going on? Do you know?
She was, wasn't she? How long has this been going on? Do you know?
Aw, I don't know what you're talking about. All I know is that you're losing your bank and
Aw, I don't know what you're talking about. All I know is that you're losing your bank and
All right. That's all. Please, Matt.
I want you both to take the day off. Go downtown and get a license and get married right away!
But I haven't . . .
But I haven't . . .
I don't want to hear any more about it. If you don't get married, I'll fire both of you.
Helen, while you're downtown, you might stop in and make reservations for the bridal suite on the Berengaria sailing next week.
Gee, thanks, Mr. Dickson
What's the matter? What's going on here? This is ridiculous! You can't hold this boy on a vague suspicion.
I'm afraid I must, Mr. Dickson.
I'm afraid I must, Mr. Dickson.
Why pick on him ?
Why pick on him ?
It's an inside job. That's a cinch. Whoever did it had a pretty good picture of the layout. Now Brown, here, is in charge of the vaults, isn't he?
It's an inside job. That's a cinch. Whoever did it had a pretty good picture of the layout. Now Brown, here, is in charge of the vaults, isn't he?
Yes.
What time did this thing happen?
The clock opposite the vault was stopped by a bullet at 12:09.
The clock opposite the vault was stopped by a bullet at 12:09.
All right. If the boy proves an alibi, he's all right, isn't he?
All right. If the boy proves an alibi, he's all right, isn't he?
If he can do it, yes.
If he can do it, yes.
Why, certainly he can. Matt, now all you've got to do is tell them where you were last night, between twelve and twelve-thirty, and everything will be all right.
That's what he says. I got a man from headquarters checking up on it now.
Good. You've got nothing to worry about. Soon as the report comes in, you'll be released. And listen, don't talk so loud. Take it easy. Coast a little.
All I know is the bank's been robbed and a murder's been committed. The way I see it, Brown here looks guilty.
What are you talking about? He had no more to do with it than you did.
What are you talking about? He had no more to do with it than you did.
Maybe. But I'm taking no chances. Why, this kid's got a record.
Maybe. But I'm taking no chances. Why, this kid's got a record.
So have you. So have I. So's everybody got a record. What difference does that make? You can't go around pinning crimes on people just because they
Of course it's true - and he knows it.
Listen, Matt. If you don't tell the truth, I can't help you. Where were you last night?
You were right, Mr. Dickson! Brown didn't have anything to do with it. Here's your man.
Why, you must be crazy. I've known this man for years.
Why, you must be crazy. I've known this man for years.
He's just confessed. He's been mixed up with the toughest gangsters in town.
My wife? What's she got to do with you?
No wonder he didn't want to mention her name.
You're lying!
Don't worry, Mr. Dickson. We'll find out whether he's telling the truth. I'll have a man from headquarters check up on it right away.
Don't worry, Mr. Dickson. We'll find out whether he's telling the truth. I'll have a man from headquarters check up on it right away.
You don't want to check up on anybody. I'll do all the checking up. Wait a minute.
Well, Sampson, what is it?
Here's the data on the Clyde deal.
Good. I'll take this along with me. Tell Clyde I'll see him tomorrow. I'm sick and tired of the delay.
I'm afraid he's been stalling.
I'm afraid he's been stalling.
That's just exactly what he has been doing. This deal should have been closed weeks ago. Tell him to keep tomorrow open . . .
That's just exactly what he has been doing. This deal should have been closed weeks ago. Tell him to keep tomorrow open . . .
He says he can't get away in the daytime.
He says he can't get away in the daytime.
How about his nights? He's too busy running around. Tell him to keep tomorrow night open, come in and sign this thing, or I'll call this whole deal off.
How about his nights? He's too busy running around. Tell him to keep tomorrow night open, come in and sign this thing, or I'll call this whole deal off.
Yes, sir.
The lobby's half filled now.
What are you talking about?
They've been coming in steady all morning. I have called for some extra police.
All right. Send down to the vaults and have our reserve cash sent up here right away.
All right. Send down to the vaults and have our reserve cash sent up here right away.
We haven't much on hand, you know. If it gets any worse, I hope we don't have to close the doors.
The bank's reputation wouldn't be worth a nickel after that. This is just a flurry, that's all. They've heard about the robbery and got panic-stricken. Listen, get a hold of our available securities and have them turned into cash. Wait a minute. Get my personal stuff and have that turned into cash too. Tell the boys anyone caught arguing with a depositor will be
Yes, sir.
Look at them, Mr. Dickson. They're going crazy.
Did you get the case for the securities?
Did you get the case for the securities?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Mine too?
Mine too?
Yes, sir. But soon as our money runs out, they'll mob the place.
The fools! If they only knew it, they're making things worse for themselves. Somebody starts a silly rumor, and they lose their heads.
What'll we do?
What'll we do?
I'll talk to them. Listen, go back and tell the boys to stall as much as possible. Tell 'em not to pay any attention to what I said. Tell 'em to verify every signature.
We can't keep open till four o'clock. We haven't cash enough to last an hour.
Don't you think I know it?
Mr. Dickson! Mr. Dickson!
Get all the big bills in the place. Take them out and get them changed. Get nothing but ones and fives. Distribute them among the tellers. Tell them to take their time. Stall as much as possible. Count and recount the money.
Get all the big bills in the place. Take them out and get them changed. Get nothing but ones and fives. Distribute them among the tellers. Tell them to take their time. Stall as much as possible. Count and recount the money.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
I hate to do this, but I've got to have time to dig up some help. I think I know where I can get some real cash. Snap into it, Sampson. We will lick this thing yet.
Yes, ma'am, you can deposit your money here.
Is it safe?
Is it safe?
Absolutely.
Absolutely.
It's his life insurance money, you know.
Quiet down, please! Take it easy, folks. Everything will be all right.
But you said it would be safe! It's his life insurance money. Oh, please, I'll go to the Old Ladies' Home if you don't do something, please!
But you said it would be safe! It's his life insurance money. Oh, please, I'll go to the Old Ladies' Home if you don't do something, please!
Please, lady. Please be quiet. Everything will be all right. Open up here, folks. All right, folks, please!
How-do-you-do, Mrs. Dickson.
Is that busy husband of mine busy?
Is that busy husband of mine busy?
He's at a board meeting.

Board meeting. Oh, that means hours, I suppose.

I'm afraid so.
I'm afraid so.
Helen, did you ever try competing with a bank?
Helen, did you ever try competing with a bank?
No.
No.
Well, take my word for it, and don't try it. It's useless! If it were some other woman, I could handle her, but after all, you can't scratch a bank's eyes out now, can you?
Well, take my word for it, and don't try it. It's useless! If it were some other woman, I could handle her, but after all, you can't scratch a bank's eyes out now, can you?
Hardly.
Oh, well. I guess the only other thing for me to do is to go out and buy myself a few sticks of dynamite. When he comes out, you tell him I'll be back. He hasn't gotten rid of me!
All right.
Hello, Helen!
Matt, come here!
Matt, come here!
Why?
Why?
Come here, honey!
Hey, look out, somebody's likely to see us!

What did you do with it?
With what?
With what?
The ten dollars.
The ten dollars.
Oh, ten dollars

A friend of mine - yeah, really - his mother was terribly sick and she was dying, would you believe it?
No.
Oh, you think I'm lying?
Oh, you think I'm lying?
Yes.
Yes.
All right, I'm lying. Don't forget you called me a liar.
All right, I'm lying. Don't forget you called me a liar.
Oh, Matt.
Say, I just heard the merger isn't going thru. Isn't that grand?
Yeah, swell.
What happened? What did he say? Did you get the job?
Yeah.
What's the matter, Matt? Gee, I thought you'd be thrilled to death.
Come here. You know, a few minutes ago I was in Cluett's office and Mrs. Dickson was there.
Come here. You know, a few minutes ago I was in Cluett's office and Mrs. Dickson was there.
Well . . . ?
Well . . . ?
Well, he was making love to her.
Oh Matt, you must be mistaken.
I tell you, I saw them!
In Cluett's office?
Yes, right in his office, the rat. I'd like to take a crack at that guy.
What's keeping you?
Oh, Charlie again.
Oh, Charlie again.
Say Matt, you haven't done anything about what you saw today, have you?
Say Matt, you haven't done anything about what you saw today, have you?
Who? Cluett? No, not yet. But I'd like to take a crack at that stiff- necked, horse dollar.[6]
Who? Cluett? No, not yet. But I'd like to take a crack at that stiff- necked, horse dollar.[6]
Oh now, don't be silly.

Can you imagine that guy? He was kissing her.

Now you've got me worried, dear. Promise me you won't butt in.
Now you've got me worried, dear. Promise me you won't butt in.
Okay, honey - but just the same I'd like to take a crack at that
Shh . . . ! I'll wait for you upstairs.
All right, dear.
Oh, Matt . . .
Don't cry, honey. Everything's gonna be all right.
What's he doing, honey? Is he getting any help?
Something's happened. He isn't trying anymore.
Something's happened. He isn't trying anymore.
They must have turned him down.
They must have turned him down.
Yes. He called some of the biggest people in town.
Yes. He called some of the biggest people in town.
Sure, they'd turn him down. He ought to know that. I'm going in there and talk to him.
Did you talk to him?
Yeah. I got an idea. Come on, let's get to a telephone.
Dickson's in a jam I tell you. The run's getting worse.
Mr. Williams . . .
Mr. Williams . . .
The big guys have got the screws on him. You've got to come through for him, Mr. Conway. He came through for you a hundred times. If his friends don't help him, who is going to help him?
The big guys have got the screws on him. You've got to come through for him, Mr. Conway. He came through for you a hundred times. If his friends don't help him, who is going to help him?

for the rheumatism, you know.
What time was it, Mrs. Halligan?

There you are!
Listen here, young man - nobody ever called me a liar yet and got away with it
That's all, Mrs. Halligan. Thanks.
You turned off the burglar alarm, you set the time clock, came back at twelve and emptied the boxes, didn't you?

But I wasn't here, Mr. Dickson. Honest I wasn't . . .
Then where were you?
You're carrying too much money on you, Hank. You better turn some in tonight.
Okay, Matt.
How are you fixed?
I'm okay, Matt.
I'm okay, Matt.
You've got enough?
That mug reminds me of a guy with his second dollar.
Yeah, what did he do with his first one?
Yeah, what did he do with his first one?
Bought himself a pocketbook!
Everybody in?
I guess so.
I guess so.
Where's Charlie?
Where's Charlie?
Charlie's upstairs as sore as a pup. He's out fourteen cents, and he can't find it.
Certainly, Mr. Jones! Certainly! Charlie!
They're starting to come in already. Yeah. Yeah. Well, listen. Don't waste any time. Get all the money you can lay your hands on, and bring it down here right away. Step on it.
You can ride like that?
I said like a Comanche, not this Comanche.
I think I may just go on to the reservation.
Tom, I'm this close to coming with you...
I couldn't lose him.
Jim Younger, I told you--
This is healing?
Sometimes a wound will kill.
Sometimes a wound will kill.
Now you tell us.
Gatling! They've got a Gatling!
Dammit, this stopped being fun about two years ago!
He's smiling.
Never a good thing.
Never thought that pissant town would look so pretty.
Anywhere nobody's shooting at me is pretty.
Your Ma wouldn't let us leave until we ate something.
That was two hours ago.
Here's Liberty's favorite son! I'll never forget what you did, cousin.
Zee, I'm pleased you came.
Our place, Clell Miller's, Sammy Johnston, the Creeders. Will Hite.
The sheriff says it was a gang of drunk Kansas boys.
The sheriff says it was a gang of drunk Kansas boys.
I say we ride into town and kill us some Pinkertons and railroad men.
These are deeds and mortgages of farms the bank was holding for the railroad.
Better pass them over here before something happens to 'em.
Uhh, yeah it does.
You stay out of this, Bob.
No, Jimmy has a point. The Younger-James Gang could be confusing.
How?
How?
Say we bust into a bank. We yell "We're the Younger-James Gang!" People are gonna be thinking, "The younger James Gang? Is there an older James Gang? How come we never heard of the older James gang?" So people are trying to figure that out instead of raising their arms.
We got a problem here, brother?
Frankly, yes. I'm feeling a little left out.
That's what the newspapers say. Weren't for Jesse James, this gang wouldn't be able to find a goat's ass with a stick.
What?
This is the best score yet.
It's still taking too long. The people used to snap to.
It's still taking too long. The people used to snap to.
That was because of... the reputation the gang had.
That was because of... the reputation the gang had.
As long as people think Jesse's still riding, we will never get the respect we deserve.

Cole, we're outlaws. Not exactly the most respectable job, if you know what I mean.
Cole, we're outlaws. Not exactly the most respectable job, if you know what I mean.
Leave me alone, Bob.
How'd they --
What have you done?
What have you done?
I ain't done --
I ain't done --
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!
Bob. I didn't...
Swear.
Swear.
I swear --
I swear --
Swear on Jimmy's grave.
I'm sorry, Cole.
You're just upset about Jesse. We all are.
Things changed when you quit the gang. For example, I'm now the one who says "Let's ride."
He's not bad at it.
He's not bad at it.
It's tougher than it looks.
My plan of lying here pissing myself seems to be working mighty fine, thank you.
I can hit those boys from here. We just need a distraction.
Yesterday.
Well, somebody better go tell THE DAMN YANKEES!
Corn gonna shoot at me?
Nope.
Nope.
Then I love it.
Jesus mercy, that's Charlie Higgins, Dave Laller ...
... Will Perry ...
Cole, I want to get to the farm, make sure Little Jim and the girls are okay.
Stop by our spread after that, tell our Ma we're all right. We'll go to Doc Mimms.
They came up, made the same offer they made you folks. Our little brother Jim tried to chase 'em off, one of those detectives hit him in the head, knocked him out. Cole lost his temper.
Oh no...
Oh no...
He just lost his temper a little.
Damn!
They said because the detectives were working for the Department of the Interior --
They said because the detectives were working for the Department of the Interior --
The Army can hang him.
The Army can hang him.
Tomorrow.
Home. We go home. We ride like hell to get there, and we kill anything or anyone that comes between us and our homes. And when we get there we stay there and God help any fool who tries to get me to leave my farm again.
Best damn plan I heard all war.
How many of them did he kill?
Two.
You have no shame.
Not yet. But I'm hoping.
But if we take their money and supplies...
Exactly.
All right, settle down. All this money ain't ours.
Well, no, Jesse, it was the bank's. That's why we had to go to all that trouble of stealing it. You explain it to him.
Well, no, Jesse, it was the bank's. That's why we had to go to all that trouble of stealing it. You explain it to him.
We oughta take some of this, give it to our neighbors in Liberty. Lot of people hurting up there.
"The outlaws calling themselves the James-Younger Gang shot their way out of town, wounding the Sherriff and three other townsfolk."
Hey!
Hey!
"Bank officials estimate the loss at fifty thousand dollars."
Okay, folks, I think we know how this is going to go...
One false move and I'll blow your heads off!
Beg pardon?
You heard me, Jesse. You know how crazy I get!
This is about the "Wanted!" Posters, isn't it.
Yes. I am obviously not standing out in people's minds at the robberies.
The things a fella has to do to get a little respect around here...
You are a fine figure of a man.
You are a fine figure of a man.
Listen, Jesse, we've got a problem. It's Cole.
Listen, Jesse, we've got a problem. It's Cole.
He's been full of vinegar lately.
He's been full of vinegar lately.
He's planning a job.
He's planning a job.
What?
What?
Listen, he's my brother and I don't want to start trouble...
Listen, he's my brother and I don't want to start trouble...
Tell me.
What?
You, ya barrel of pork lard. Here piggy piggy!
What you sayin' boy?
I think I recognize you.
I think I recognize you.
How?
How?
I think I saw you leavin' by the front door just as I was coming in the back.
You shut up now, boy.
No, really. You're wife said she needed some help, seeing as you were so fat you couldn't find your --
'Bout time you got here, buddy.
What's going on?
Ride with me, cousin?
I could use the walk.
I could use the walk.
Suit yourself. We'll have some horses waiting for you at the road. Let's ride, Rangers!
Where you boys going?
There's Yankees back there. Lot's of 'em.
Home, boys. Back to our farms.
Planting corn. Harvesting corn. Year after year.
Hands off your hip, Cole.
You're not scared, are you?
You're not scared, are you?
Pick your fights, cousin. You taught me that.
Not now.
What is wrong with you?
What is wrong with you?
In case we have to kill these sonofabitches, I don't want them to see us coming.
You ever notice Zerelda's eyes?
She got two of them.
She had a moustache.
She was European!
She was European!
All right, calm down. I'll agree Sadie was a woman --
Thanks for the help.
After all you did on our farm? You miss it, don't you Jesse?
After all you did on our farm? You miss it, don't you Jesse?
The war? What, are you crazy? There are things I miss about it.
The war? What, are you crazy? There are things I miss about it.
It was exciting.
It was exciting.
But it was a whole lot of killing. Why should we miss that?
Because we were good at it? Hell, we were great at it. Jesse, don't tell anyone I said this, because everybody knows I'm the toughest man in this town, but you are one terrifying sonofabitch with those guns.
Yeah.
This isn't a feud, this is war. They've got more men than we do. We kill detectives, they can replace 'em in a day.
So what do we do, General Lee?
So what do we do, General Lee?
Just like in the war. Harass their supply lines. We kill the railroad's men, they won't care.
I'll pick the first job! I mean... I know a girl down at the bank. See if she can't get a list of towns where the railroad keeps its money.
Perfect, Cole.
Perfect, Cole.
Let's ride.
The James-Younger Gang.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Don't let it happen again.
I got seven thousand.
I got three.
See, Frank's being smart about this.
Just because he reads all those books and knows all those big words doesn't make him smart.
It's not a bank.
It's better. It's a construction depot. They'll have the strongbox and some ammo and explosives for us to take. That way we can take on a bigger job.
"The Fidelity Bank and Trust was robbed on Tuesday by a gang of twenty heavily armed men."
Twenty?!
Jesse, we got to have a word.
Sure, cousin.
Sure, cousin.
All the posters and newspapers are calling this bunch the "James-Younger Gang."
All the posters and newspapers are calling this bunch the "James-Younger Gang."
Yep.
Yep.
Why aren't we the "Younger-James Gang"? I mean, there's three Younger brothers and only two James brothers here.
This is your fault for hogging all the publicity.
Hold on, hold on, we all know Bob is an important part of the gang.
It'll be the biggest score yet.
What will be?
Smells funny, it being mentioned in the paper.
If you'd read about it first, you'd have no problems.
If you'd read about it first, you'd have no problems.
What are you saying?
What are you saying?
I've robbed just as many banks as you have! I know this town, and I know this bank, and I say it's an easy job.
I've robbed just as many banks as you have! I know this town, and I know this bank, and I say it's an easy job.
You're forgetting who's in charge --
Beautiful.
Now the one time one of us comes up with an idea --
Now the one time one of us comes up with an idea --
A bad idea.
A bad idea.
I got us through the War all right.
I got us through the War all right.
And almost got hanged in peacetime.
And almost got hanged in peacetime.
That's it.
I'm the better soldier, Jesse.
And I'm the better outlaw.
Still smells fishy.
Then let me run the show, General Lee.
Fine. We hit this bank.
You'll be smiling once you've got all that money to spend, cousin. Cole Younger's going to make everybody rich!
Dammit!
A trap.
Okay, you're gonna rest here.
Clell, Tom, go get Doc Mimms in Liberty!
Bob, rip up some bandages.
Pass me some whisky.
We'll make them pay for this.
I'm out.
I'm out.
WHAT?! We follow you for a year, and now that our blood's been spilled, you're gonna quit?!
WHAT?! We follow you for a year, and now that our blood's been spilled, you're gonna quit?!
Who's next? You? Me? Bob?
Missed you, cousin.
Missed you too, cousin.
You know, you gettin' caught, right after leaving us, some people thought --
Pff. All we been through, the thought never crossed my mind.
Where'd you get all these riders?
We didn't. Zerelda did. Turns out your wife makes a hell of an outlaw.
Some Indian tracker you turned out to be, Tom.
You pay me to find you Bluecoats. There they are.
Wait'll we get back to Missouri, start telling those gals about how little Jesse James charged the whole Union Army by himself!
You ride like a Comanche.
Tom, why don't you stop at our spread before you head on out to the reservation? Figure we might have some work for you, if you want.
Hmm. Go back to the reservation and get drunk in a dirt shack, or work for you...
Hmm. Go back to the reservation and get drunk in a dirt shack, or work for you...
Well?
Well?
I'm thinking...
Cannon or Gatling?
Both would be nice.
Both would be nice.
Soon as I hit one, the other'll know and beat us up.
What the --
Must be a garrison in town. We're in occupied territory, boys.
I think one of 'em's glass.
Which one, right or left?
Which one, right or left?
The brown one.
Oh, Lord, the dance hall girl at Bunty's...
Sadie was not a man!
I have no idea what you just said, but it sounded real nice.
Shakespeare. He's European.
Shakespeare. He's European.
Ah.
BASTARDS! Come back here and face me!
Get buckets!
Hey! We decide something, that's it! We're in this for the long haul, and this idea of me and Jesse's will help give us more places to hide out without worrying about some farmer with a shotgun sneakin' up on us in our sleep. We've got to think --
Strategically.
Strategically.
-- Exactly. Because this is a war.
Jesse.
Oh, you're in charge? We ain't partners any more, Jesse? You tell Cole Younger where and when to ride?
Oh, you're in charge? We ain't partners any more, Jesse? You tell Cole Younger where and when to ride?
Cole, he didn't mean that.
Another dozen out back.
They gonna rush us?
They gonna rush us?
They're just insurance in case we run.
The safe. Now.
Of course! Uh, sir?
Of course! Uh, sir?
What?
What?
Where is Jesse James?
Where is Jesse James?
This here is the Younger Gang!
OPEN THE DAMN SAFE!
All right, all right. Jesse James never yelled at folk...
You 'um big lawman?
Yeah, Injun. What do you want?
Yeah, Injun. What do you want?
Great Chief of St. Louis send me.
Great Chief of St. Louis send me.
The District Marshall
Of St. Louis?
Ho-yah. Him say tell Big Lawman in Carville that badman Jesse James riding toward Rising Sun, above Great River, near Eagle Rock.

Ho-yah!
Go ahead to the saloon. But don't get too drunk!
Me get heap firewater --
I know it ain't no durned bank holiday!
You're right, sir.
You're right, sir.
Then why can't I go in there?
Then why can't I go in there?
On account of we're robbing it.
On account of we're robbing it.
Oh. Why didn't you just say so?
Oh. Why didn't you just say so?
It's a secret.
It's a secret.
Fine. I'll just wait here.
Fine. I'll just wait here.
I'd appreciate that.
What the --
What is it?
What is it?
Old Man Tucker is just standing quiet outside the bank.

So?
So?
When have you ever known Old Man Tucker not to be yelling at everybody?
Where the hell were you?
I had you covered. From back there.
I had you covered. From back there.
Shit.
-- rode right into them, screaming like a banshee.
My little Web did that?
My little Web did that?
Pff. He jumped his horse clear over our heads, killed a dozen Union soldiers before they knew what hit them.
Web died fighting?
Died a hero.
Boys...
Go home, Doc. They ain't gonna hang no more Liberty boys.
What do you say, sir?
Go on. You're pretty much all healed up.
You know you're welcome any time!
Yesss, but I was thinking, I could come by, and then take Zee out. Some place near. With other folk. Near. Here. But out.
Yesss, but I was thinking, I could come by, and then take Zee out. Some place near. With other folk. Near. Here. But out.
It's fine by me, Jesse.
Daddy, don't start with this again.
Zerelda, it's no coincidence. The railroad men come through, offering to buy up land. Nobody sells. Then they start hanging men who own farms for treason?
He's going to be fine, right Daddy?
The bullet came out clean, but he lost a whole lot of blood. Praying wouldn't hurt.
They're gone. What are you --
I fooled them into thinking I was alone.
I fooled them into thinking I was alone.
Well, I hope the boy pulls through. We should know in the morning.
Well, I hope the boy pulls through. We should know in the morning.
I think he's already feeling better.
He thinks this is some kind of game!
I'm upset too, Zee, but Jesse and Cole know what they're doing. I'm sure they won't press their luck.
Every time I put my head up to hit that Gatling, they try to shoot it off.
So we got a plan?
Distracting enough for you?
Pff. They hardly even noticed you.
Pff. They hardly even noticed you.
So you're saying I could have done more to attract their attention.
So you're saying I could have done more to attract their attention.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Such as?

You could have worn one of those big, floppy woman's Easter Sunday hats.

That would have made an impression.

See, that's your problem, Frank. By the time you finish figuring out stuff, I'm already finished doing it.
See, that's your problem, Frank. By the time you finish figuring out stuff, I'm already finished doing it.
No, Jesse, your problem is you're always doing stuff before I'm finished figuring it out.
Web's dead.
I reckoned.
I reckoned.
Hell of a war.
Hell of a war.
I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.
Hello, Liberty Missoura!
All this time in the saddle... We get to the farm, I'm going to shoot this damn horse just on principle.
Looks like Web Mimms wasn't the only casualty this town's got.
We better go to Doc's, see what's going on here.
Frank, don't you have something to say?
You're doing just fine.
You're doing just fine.
Zee, we got to talk to you and your father.
Whyyyy... he took down the Gatling gun and the cannon all by himself.
Saved all our lives, Doc. None of the Liberty boys would have come home if not for Web Mimms, Doc. God's honest truth.
All we thought about was coming home. I swore I'd kill anybody who tried to get me off my farm again. If I have to go to war with the railroad to stay, fine by me.
Think about this. If we just come up with a story and stick to it, we should be all right.
Think about this. If we just come up with a story and stick to it, we should be all right.
What kind of story are they going to believe?
That just might work.
Maybe, maybe...
"Big and older"?
You can shut up now.
You can shut up now.
You are a charmer.
You are a charmer.
I swear I'll shoot you in your sleep.
I swear I'll shoot you in your sleep.
Next time try "fat and haggard."
She's still talking to Jesus.
What worries me is that Jesus is talking back.
-- if you stop saying things about my Zee.
Your Zee? Hmm. "From women's eyes this doctrine I derive: they sparkle still the right Promethean fire; They are the books, the arts, the academes, that show, contain, and nourish all the world."
You know him?
Heard of him.
I went up to the courthouse and looked at the right of way documents for the rail bed. The railroad doesn't even need our land, they're just taking the land on both sides for as far as they can.
Damn. All that reading paid off.
You ready to stop loafing around with this young lady and get back to farming?
What do you think?
What do you think?
Would you get in the carriage? Until Ma has you home so she can fuss over you herself, she's gonna make me miserable.
You're looking a bit more spry now that somebody --
Shut up. Uh, Doc, I was wondering if, uh, this evening, I could come by?
Pinkertons. It's the railroad.
Ma.
... We could move on. Rebuild. Make a decent life someplace else.
Don't care.
Don't care.
Didn't think you would. I'm going to go make the coffin.
Didn't think you would. I'm going to go make the coffin.
Make a thousand of 'em. Still won't be enough by the time I'm through.
How'd it go in there?
Fine. How'd it go out here?
Fine. How'd it go out here?
We're gonna have to talk...
And I planned getting you off the hangman's deck --
And that's why you both lead the gang. Two of you went into that bank together, right?
And it's guarded by Pinkerton detectives.
And I do so want to shoot some Pinkerton detectives.
I don't think it's counterfeit. Do you mind if I take a look at all your real bills to compare?
It's the scientific method. It's all the rage.
Gents, we are in the middle of something here.
Bob's upset.
Bob's upset.
The posters?
Pardon the delay, folks, but we had to get Mad Bob Younger under control!
Bob here'll kill a man for sneezing, and he's the best shot in the gang.
This has been a good year.
Jesse, we're outlaws.
Jesse, we're outlaws.
And we're good at it.
And we're good at it.
It got to you, didn't it. All the killing in the war. You need it now.

Maybe it started out that way. But now...

What do you want me to say, Frank? I was killing men when I was fifteen. I like getting shot at. I like riding out of town with a posse at my back. This is a helluva better life than farming.
What do you want me to say, Frank? I was killing men when I was fifteen. I like getting shot at. I like riding out of town with a posse at my back. This is a helluva better life than farming.
A better life than the one you could have had with Zee?
We're drunk.
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.
Just do me a favor. Think about what this is costing everybody. Not just the railroad.
You taking sides against me, now, Frank?
No, I --
They're all pinned down. Can't even get to the door.
Got any ideas, little brother?
Shoulda learned with Web. Made it look fun, made it look like an adventure. Got Web killed. Now Jim.
Jim was old enough...

He was a boy riding with the most famous outlaws in the West. How was he supposed to say no to that?

See you soon. Oh, and I appreciate the distraction back there.

Hell, they hardly even noticed us.
Y'know, Uncle Frank...
Yeah, Jimmy?

I know. But that's how it should have ended. Your Dad and Mom, riding off into a new life, growing old together, happy.
Allow a man his version of the past. When you get to be my age, you've got enough painful memories, you're allowed to soften a few of the edges up.
Sounds like he was a hell of a man.

How much of that story is true?

Everything but the boring parts.
Did you kill Yankees?
A fair number, Ma.
A fair number, Ma.
Say your prayers?
Ma, I'm glad to see you being nice to our Injun friend.
He's a good Christian and he killed Yankees. Jesus told me that made him an all right boy.
Easterners.
We're just fine, thank you, sir.
The Lord says we can bury 'em out back in the orchard, nobody'll ever find them.
Somebody's in a vengeful smiting mood today.
Ma! Please!
Boys?
Riders --
We know, Ma. Now we got to get you to Doc Mimms.
We know, Ma. Now we got to get you to Doc Mimms.
Take care of each other, boys. You say your prayers.
Doc Mimms will --
Shush.
Zerelda? Little Zee Mimms?
You were little Jesse James when you left.
You were little Jesse James when you left.
But you got big!
But still died.
If there's anything we can do for you, Dr. Mimms. We want to help.
Jesse, are you awake?
Mmmm.

Nuh-huh ...
You shouldn't be up.
I've been on my back two weeks. I'm sick of it.

Yep.
Were you planning on kissing me when you finished quoting?
Were you planning on kissing me when you finished quoting?
I've been planning on kissin' you for a very long time.
I am so sorry, Jesse.
Frank and me have to go away for a while.
You and I, we've started... something, you know? I don't know what'll happen if you do this.
Me neither.
Me neither.

I had to see you. I'm getting married.
I don't understand.
She's the most wonderful woman in the world. Can't get her out of my mind.

That's... wonderful. It's just... I thought...

She's beautiful. Smart. And has the biggest... buck teeth in all of Missouri.
I would never have imagined us in a place like this.
That's why I picked it. We can start a whole new life down here.

Are you going to be happy here, Mr. James? Without all that excitement?

Now wait a minute. There are certain things that have to wait until after the wedding.
Hmm.
"Hmm" what?
"Hmm" what?
"But the life of the James Gang wasn't all robbing and shooting and killing, for these young Missouri bucks had a taste for the ladies... especially the handsome and charismatic Jesse James."
I beg your pardon?
"Blazing Guns of the West. True Stories of Jesse James." Only a dime in the hotel lobby.

Oh, I'm not finished. "When he sauntered into a saloon, his spurs jangling and his pockets full of gold, the ladies flocked around him like flies to a candied apple." As I said. Hmm.

Did you order our houses burned down?
Not that day. I am guilty of many things, but that was Mr. Thaddeus Rains and Parker, that day.
You almost ended my career before it began.
Pity.
How did you spot the ambush in Torrell?
Last February?

Was it worth it?

That was for my Ma. Now this is for everybody else.
He's too important, James. They'll set the army on you. You and your wife.
The railroad has no business in Tennessee. Therefore I have no interest in the state of Tennessee.
Thanks.
Thanks.
I'd just as soon kill you, Jesse James. But chasing you takes up too much of my time.

This is unusual. Most of our marriages are members of the congregation.
You don't think God'll mind, do you?
The Lord is remarkably tolerant of the charitable. "Jesse Woodson James." Jesse James? The Jesse James?

I was always jealous Web Mimms got to go off and fight with you and Cole. Now it's my turn.

It's his money. He's putting up the payroll out of his own fortune. You do want to hurt Thaddeus Rains, don't you Jesse?

You're gonna tell her when you're resting up in bed with her, Jimmy.
Why, yeah.
I hope you don't mind, Jesse James told me your name.

Don't talk about it much, though.
Well, this land is about to be condemned.
I'm doing you folks a favor --
Relax, Alan. The Army has this all in hand. And Mr. Thaddeus Rains will be very pleased with this news. Nothing like a hanging to motivate the populace to relocate.
It's not my job to relax. I've put men facing out both ways down Main Street, so nobody can ride in shooting. I've got a sharpshooter up on the water tower just in case.
My professional opinion is that you have managed to piss off the wrong bunch of farm boys this time.
They had to be dealt with!
They had to be dealt with!
By burning down their homes?
How can that be?
They donate money to farmers, to churches. Rumor has it they gave the sharecroppers of Maddox so much money they were able to build a school.
There's only four of them...
Move you fools!
Mr. Thaddeus Rains, sir, it is a pleasure to have you join us in the field.
And it is my pleasure to be here.
And it is my pleasure to be here.
Really!
Really!
NO! It is NOT my pleasure to have to leave my board room to come to this godforsaken piece of dirt to discover why in the name of all that is holy you cannot seem to evict a few simple farmers from their PATHETIC LITTLE MUDHOLES so that I may build the GREATEST railroad that this country has ever seen!

I can completely understand your distress, sir.
Parker, tell me what's going on so I can return as quickly as possible to Boston and my whores and cigars, not necessarily in that order.
Two weeks ago, we managed to arrange to have the Army hang one of the local farmers.

Good.

Unfortunately not, sir. A gang of local thugs managed to rescue him from the gallows. Not only has this inspired resistance from the other farmers, the redoubtable Mr. Alan Pinkerton was seriously injured during the incident.

Yes sir.

Just perfect.

A further impediment is that the Army garrison has been ordered to move on from Liberty. We will no longer have that particular stick with which to threaten the farmers.

You see the Army leaving and you see the loss of a tool. I see a power void to be filled. As we have the most power, we may move with impunity.

They exchanged fire with the Pinkerton Guards, killing several of them. Then they raided the payroll office and blew the tracks for half a mile.
How much did they get from the safe?

We did.
Your men knew the risks.
What is going on here, man?
With my money!
We should go burn that school to the ground, sir!
The final route for the railroad is complete.
I look forward to seeing it.
Parker.
Sir?
Sir?
What is that?
What is that?
What, sir?
That.
Oh, that. I'll let Jenkins explain.
This is him.
I remember you.
How did you know?
Not such a menace now, is he, Pinkerton?
Look at this, Pinkerton! They got the payroll, and this damage will set construction back two months at least.
Not to mention my men who lost their lives.
You wouldn't have done that?
Oh no, I would have done that. But I would have made sure I killed them, too.
Oh no, I would have done that. But I would have made sure I killed them, too.
I want them arrested and hanged!

Would a jury around here convict their own? I think not. We're beginning an interesting game here, Mr. Rains.

This is no game.
This is no game.
I'm afraid our adversaries don't agree.
"A Rock Island and Pacific Railroad depot was robbed two nights ago just outside St. Louis, Missouri. The brave and daring James-Younger Gang was heavily outnumbered by Pinkerton detectives, but the city lawmen were no match for the guns of the West."
It is a nice piece of writing.
It is a nice piece of writing.
"The gang made off with thirty-five thousand dollars and also destroyed the Thaxton Switch construction, meaning that for a few months honest farmers will be able to sleep without fearing the railroad is coming to steal their land!" Who wrote this!? I'll see him hanged every Tuesday for a month!

Oh, that's the best part.
It's early in the game yet, Mr. Rains. Jesse James and I are just learning how each other moves, feeling out each other's patterns.
I'm losing millions of dollars and months of time while you play chess with these farmers!
I'm losing millions of dollars and months of time while you play chess with these farmers!
Hardly farmers. I've done some checking. All these were in the War. These men know sabotage, tactics, and have four years of bloody fighting experience behind them. They are disciplined, well-trained and have a charismatic leader. If I were to design the perfect outlaw band, this gang is what I would create.

It's going to be a long winter.
Pinkerton. It's been eight months. I see robberies. I see hold ups. But I do not see men on the end of nooses.
All of the James Gang's encounters have been with local law enforcement who, quite frankly, are no match for this group's cunning.
First of all: you, shut up. Now, you've given me a thousand miles of railroad to cover. Every time the James Gang strikes, we shift a hundred detectives to that area. But there's just too much open land, too many riverbeds to ride, caves to hide in. This gang operates across four states, often riding a hundred miles between jobs.
I can't believe this.
I can't believe this.
And there are some towns in Missouri where James and his men can walk openly, as heroes.
Yes, that's the way to win the locals back to our side.
I demand action.
I demand action.
No, you demand results. They are not the same thing. And if you want results, you will let me do my job as I see fit. Unless of course, You want this fool to saddle up and take another run at it?

It's going to be a long spring.
So he's won.
No.
Every three months, the James Gang circles back to the vicinity of Liberty, Missouri. They always pull a job right before they return, probably to have extra money to give family and friends.

Oh Christ, this really isn't worth it. And see, Courtney, it's there for what? Huh? Tell us. Why is it pulled down half an inch? So it can catch the force of the ejaculate!
Well, it's not a turn-on for me. I have a promotion coming to me. I don't want to get AIDS.

I'm...in touch with humanity. Evelyn, I'm sorry. You're just not terribly important to me.
No, no, no.
I know my behavior is...erratic sometimes.
If you really want to do something for me, you can stop making this scene right now.
Oh God, I can't believe this.
Oh God, I can't believe this.
I'm leaving now. I've assessed the situation and I'm going.
Where are you going?
I'm just leaving.
I'm just leaving.
But where?
But where?
I have to return some videotapes.
You'll notice that my friends and I all look and behave in a remarkably similar fashion, but there are subtle differences between us. McDermott is the biggest asshole. Van Patten is the yes man. Price is the most wired. I'm the best looking. We all have light tans. Right now I'm in a bad mood because this is not a good table, and Van
What are the rules for a sweater vest?

Good coloring.
Good coloring.
That's bone. And the lettering is something called Silian Rail.
Eggshell with Romalian type. What do you think?
Nice.
But Laurie Kennedy is a total hardbody. What do you think, Bateman?
I know her. I knew her.
Because he dated her.
How did you guess?
How did you guess?
Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ, Bateman.
Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ, Bateman.
Thanks, guy, but...she's got a lousy personality.
Do you know what Ed Gein said about women?
Ed Gein? Maitre d' at Canal Bar?
Ed Gein? Maitre d' at Canal Bar?
No, serial killer, Wisconsin in the fifties. He was an interesting guy.
Listen, what about dinner?
Is that all you ever have to contribute, Van Patten? "What about fucking dinner?"
Are you my two o'clock?
No.
Can I help you?
I'm looking for...Paul Owen's...place.
Doesn't he live here?
No, he doesn't.
No, he doesn't.
Are you sure?
Are you sure?
You saw the ad in the Times?

No. Yes. I mean yes, I did. In the Times. But... doesn't Paul Owen still live here?
No. Yes. I mean yes, I did. In the Times. But... doesn't Paul Owen still live here?
There was no ad in the Times.
I think you should go now.
But I think...I want to know what happened here.
But I think...I want to know what happened here.
Don't make any trouble. Please. I suggest you go.
Don't come back.
I won't...don't worry.
Excuse me, gentlemen. Right back. He approaches Carnes cautiously.
Face it-the Japanese will own most of this country by the end of the '90s.
Jesus, Davis. Yes. That was hilarious. That was you, wasn't it?
Yes, naturally.
Yes, naturally.
Bateman killing Owen and the escort girls? Oh that s fabulous. That's rich...
It was a pretty long message, wasn't it?
What exactly do you mean?
What exactly do you mean?
The message you left.
By the way Davis, how is Cynthia? You're still seeing her, right?
But wait, Harold, what do you mean?
Carnes? Wait.
Davis. I'm not one to bad-mouth anyone, your joke was amusing. But come on, man, you had one fatal flaw: Bateman's such a dork, such a boring, spineless lightweight, that I couldn't fully appreciate it. I wasn't fooled for a second. Now, if you'd said Price, or McDermott...Otherwise, it was amusing. Now, let's have lunch or dinner or something. Hilarious, Davis. A killer.

What are you talking about? Bateman is what?
What are you talking about? Bateman is what?
Oh Christ. He can barely pick up an escort girl, let alone...what was it you said he did to her?
Now, if you'll excuse me, I really must...
Wait. Stop. You don't seem to understand. You're not really comprehending any of this. I killed him. I did it, Carnes. I'm Patrick Bateman. I chopped Owen's fucking head off. I tortured dozens of girls. The whole message I left on your machine was true.

No! Listen, don't you know who I am? I'm not Davis, I'm Patrick Bateman! I talk to you on the phone all the time! Don't you recognize me? You're my lawyer.
Now, Carnes, listen to me. Listen very, very carefully. I killed Paul Owen and I liked it. I can't make myself any clearer
But that's simply not possible. And I don't find this funny anymore.

It never was supposed to he! Why isn't it possible?
It never was supposed to he! Why isn't it possible?

There's this theory out now that if you can catch the AIDS virus through having sex with someone who is infected, then you can also catch anything-Alzheimer's, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, leukemia, diabetes, dyslexia, for Christ's sake-you can get dyslexia from pussy-

Like what?
Well, we have to end apartheid for one. And slow down the nuclear arms race, stop terrorism and world hunger. But we can't ignore our social needs. either We have to stop people from abusing the welfare system. We have to provide food and shelter for the homeless and oppose racial discrimination and promote civil rights while also promoting equal rights for women but

Did you know that Whitney Houston's debut LP called simply Whitney Houston had four number-one singles on it? Did you know that, Christie? Whitney's voice leaps across so many boundaries and is so versatile-though she's mainly a jazz singer-that it's hard to take in the album on a first listening.
You actually listen to Whitney Houston? You actually have a Whitney Houston CD? More than one?

Yeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking dump.
Yeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking dump.
Too true. You know, Bateman-people tend to reveal so much more about themselves when they're in a relaxed setting, don't you think?
I mean they want to get caught.
Dan, great to see you again. Like I said, you need anything at all, I'm your man. I don't envy your job. I mean Owen was a...complex man.
I actually came to see Timothy Price, but he's taken a leave of absence.
Yeah, gone into rehab. Shame. Is he a suspect?
Yeah, gone into rehab. Shame. Is he a suspect?
Not really.
Do you remember where you were on the night of Paul's disappearance? Which was on the twentieth of December?
God...I guess...I was probably returning videotapes.
I had a date with a girl named Veronica.
Wait. That's not what I've got.

We had...gone to a new musical called...Oh Africa, Brave Africa. It was...a laugh riot...and that's about it. I think we had dinner at Orso's. No, Petaluma. No, Orso's. The...last time I physically saw him was...at an automated teller. I can't remember which...just one that was near, um, Nell's.
Well, thank you, Mr. Bateman.
Patrick, please. I hope I've been informative. Long day-a bit scattered.

He was at Atlantis with Craig McDermott, Frederick Dibble, Harry Newman, George Butner and  - you.
Oh, right. Of course...We had wanted Paul Owen to come. But he said he had plans...I guess I had dinner with Victoria...the following night.
Personally I think the guy went a little nutso. Split town for a while. Maybe he did go to London. Sightseeing. Drinking. Whatever. Anyway, I'm pretty sure he'll turn up sooner or later. I mean, to think that one of his friends killed him, for no reason whatsoever would be too ridiculous. Isn't that right, Patrick?

So, wasn't Rothschild originally handling the Fisher account? How did you get it?

And Cecelia, how is she? Where is she tonight?
Cecelia is, well...you know

Come on, you dumb son of a bitch. I've got a preview of the Barneys catalogue and a bottle of Absolut waiting for us.
You like Huey Lewis and the News?
They're okay. BATEMAN Their early work was a little too New Wave for my taste. But then Sports came out in 1983, I think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically.
Hey, Halberstam?
Yes, Owen?

I don't believe it. He looks so...normal. He seems so... out of it. So...undangerous.
I just don't see how someone, anyone, can appear that way and yet be involved in such total shit. How can you be so fucking, I don't know, cool about it?
Some guys are just born cool, I guess.

Anything? That's not even credible. If he wants to go up there? To check it out? I think you should encourage him. It's his life. But everybody's treating him like this -- valuable object. You're hurting your own case.
I think I kind of lost it. I was just so thrilled to be talking to the richest, most powerful... 'Didn't know I even cared about that stuff.
C'mon, how often do you talk to somebody who's been on the cover of Time. Three of four times.
A lot of what Larry says is true. They just clone stuff, or reverse engineer it, and everybody gets stuck with their inferior version cause they --
Then you've gotta ask him about that.
It's important.

When I was a kid? And he was moving us all over the place? I spent all my time writing stuff on Outpost 1.0. I thought Gary Boyd was the greatest.
But he's not quite the same guy anymore. Don't get your hopes too high?
If my dad'd leveled with me like that even once... The weird thing is, my fantasy he could somehow be like the old Gary? It's his fantasy, too.

We're not gonna let it.
You know he's never been anybody's counselor before?

That's what I need to ask you. You know you can't keep anything from me.
That's what I need to ask you. You know you can't keep anything from me.
He gave me some new code-fixes this morning. I said, "Did you really do this just today?" Cause I was impressed. He said "What're you implying?"
It's the way he said it. Just the way my dad did, when he was caught in a lie. That's how you knew you were onto something ugly.
What would it mean, anyway? If he didn't write it?
What would it mean, anyway? If he didn't write it?

What's extreme is what that ER doctor said when he pumped your stomach. Eat another sesame seed and that's it.

Are you gonna tell me where you went?
I went to see the Skywire model in Gary's office. You know. Just to hold it again.
No. No. I sent an E-mail to somebody, just now. To tell her how I feel about you. You know I'm clueless, without you. You know I --

Prick.
He said it made sense that Gary's code was like Teddy's, that that cliché about great minds was true. Said it was all about his own guilt. Plus, he has a tendency to get Gary mixed-up with his dad once in a while. It always passes.
He wasn't acting?
He wasn't acting?
I don't think he knows how.
Don't worry, Milo. I'm here as a friend. Or maybe a supplicant.
Right... What's that mean again?
Right... What's that mean again?
Beggar. We're at a disadvantage with Outpost. Our experts aren't as smart as theirs. Sometimes we can't tell which technologies pose the threat of a monopoly.

I think they call him the "Houseman." 'Cause "guard" sounds too weird.

Oh. No thanks.

There's a rumor going around, maybe you've heard it.
I've only shown this to three other people. I bought 200, we've launched 12 so far. I keep the coordinates in this room. It's left over from SDI. Reagan's Star Wars technology? They orbit 426 miles up.

Skywire.
The content filer has t'be written into the media files so bits coming off the satellite can be read by multiplatforms. Really, omniplatforms. Including whatever new hardware emerges.
It needs a more object-oriented language. This doesn't scale, does it?
It needs a more object-oriented language. This doesn't scale, does it?
You'd have to start practically from scratch. But this is all you'd be working on. No marketing meetings, no product seminars. We can't waste the time. Half the Valley's working on convergence. So're media conglomerates, cable companies, phone companies. 'Can't finish second, Milo. There is no second... Now what would you like to ask me?
When you get to a certain age, you start wondering. About your legacy. I doubt you even remember Outpost 1.0 --
I do!
I do!
Yeah? I wanna feel like I did when I wrote that. But I'm 42, that's 100 in cyber-years. I look at you and see the things that got me here. But somehow got away.

Could work with a new switch. There may be a few more things hidden.
Don't spend too much time searching. You ever vetted somebody's old code before? It's a different skill. Stay close to the surface. The best-hidden secrets are in plain sight. You know the best place to hide a leaf, right? In a tree.
How's it going?
Maybe I'm going too fast.
Maybe I'm going too fast.
Too fast? At least four companies're on the verge of workable convergence systems, Milo, they --
It's okay. Really.
Take a look at this. Slightly different approach.
You did this -- overnight?
You're making me young again.
Milo. What's up?
Well -- you sent for me.
Well -- you sent for me.
Right... Right.
You really wrote this just today?
What're you implying.
What're you implying.
Nothing!
Everything I do is under scrutiny. The questions they ask, trying to make anything strategic look sordid. I'm confused. Doesn't everybody in business try to get ahead?
I'm sure.
I'm sure.
The purpose of this company isn't to destroy our competitors any more than the purpose of living is to breath. But the software business is binary: you're a zero or a one. Being obsessive isn't a crime. It's a character trait.
It scales, don't you think?
Definitely.
I heard what happened.
Were the flags for Teddy?
Had you talked to him much lately?
Just once. 'Guess I was worried we didn't have anything to talk about, since work was off-limits. Non- disclosure.

Wow. You must have 20,000 lines of code there...
34,000. But they're real short lines. 'Just came out that way.
Been thinking about the push mechanism in the handler. And it came over me: it's in the wrong place.
The wrong place?

Why did you move around so much? When you were a kid.
...My dad was a compulsive gambler. Only he didn't think he was. That applied to guys who didn't have a "system." "Losers," who played games of chance. He could "read" people, so chance had nothing to do with it. No matter how deep a hole he dug himself, he'd give you the whole speech. And you'd better not point out the obvious. His creditors

What would you tell the kids? At your new school? You had to come up with a good story, right?
No. I just went deeper into the machine. Preferred being the geek to having to explain. Lying would've been worse.
...Worse?
...Worse?
Cause he was a liar. And I hated him. "Get your head out of that machine, wise up to the real world." The more he mocked me the deeper I went. Cause if being savvy meant being like him -- Guess that's why I'm kind of clueless, even now. Didn't cultivate my conniving side. 'Not sure I even have one.

That's great! Thanks.
'Sorry about the late notice...
"Dear Lisa. I've enjoyed working with you. I'd be lying if I didn't say I find you attractive. But in my heart I know that Alice..." You left my party to send E-mail?
I couldn't do it at work cause of security or at home for -- obvious reasons.
You could've handwritten it.
I'm not much good at handwriting. Or parties.

Oh, that's right. You're "clueless."
Gary, I --
You see what's hanging on the wall?
I hope you know what you mean to me. Not just because of what you're doing. Because of who you are.
I do know, Gary. I feel the same way. I thought I was coming here for a job. But it's meant a lot more.
I'm pretty close. But when I wrote the last contact switches, it wiped out a piece of the content filer. You know what it's like, writing software.
I do know. You focus on the big problem. But somewhere down the chain, something breaks down. Something gets destroyed. At first it's upsetting. You feel you've lost control.
This is good. Who did it?

There may be a little less trust after your outburst.

Nothing does. Still. I want him to like me.

I think you should go.

I mean, it's your life.
I know you lost all his work. Maybe I could come down here and --

Any irregularity in the pattern.
Delbert seems to enter #21 twice. Without leaving the first time.

They know. 'Just they don't trust me with it. So we'll get the evidence, first, ask questions later.

I'm calling Gary.
Come with me.
Where we going?
Now what are we doing? I don't get any of this shit!

Didn't mean to pry. I just have this theory. Some of us who got to good at this? We were -- escaping something.
Did I say something?
No, I know what you mean. I used to spend my life wishing people could be like computers. Least they make sense. Sometimes you think they've betrayed you. Like a person would. But then you see, no, you just missed a step. You can go back and make it all work.
What've you got there?
Graphical interfaces. For Skywire? I'm s'posed to coordinate with you.

The Day Care?
It's easy to know who the smart geeks are, the schools tell 'em. They upload medical files, school records, pharmacy files. They'd be happy just to steal code forever. But when a program gets close to fruition. Like Teddy. He was almost there.
But why would they --?
But why would they --?
You know. There is no second place. And what's the risk? The killings're undetectable, they're hand-tailored, they make "sense." I mean, they're in the information business. They have scenarios for all of us, too. In case we find out too much.
I know why you're so secretive. Why you won't let anybody near you. I know what he did to you.
Oh yeah?
Is that my -- scenario? Tell me.
They'd frame him.
They'd frame him.
He's out of prison?

There're so many disinformation sites about Gary already. Where he has devil's horns or they crop him in with Saddam Hussein.
The mainstream media. TV, or a newsmagazine.
Right. But Gary's tied-in to a lot of media conglomerates. Have to be careful who we pick.

Time?
Time-Warner has a 40 per cent stake in Gary's set-top device. That also takes out CNN. "GE joins Outpost in new venture," which means NBC is out. "Disney joins Outpost," ABC is out. "Outpost and Newscorp in new deal," Fox is out. Any of these places could have a mole. Or all of 'em. It's like a a continuous loop. We can go to
How close are you?
What?
What?
He's got 12 satellites up. He's got dishes on top of 21. He's building this -- mega-network for Skywire. Let's use it.
We can't just assume they're standing by to receive Skywire 12 months from launch. I'd have to write in an aglet.
A what?
A what?
It's how on-line services push logos they wanna sell you. You don't ask for 'em, they just appear. 'Have to work on it somewhere besides my office or my house. And then the quality of the broadcast wouldn't exactly be digital, that's 12 months away.

Why were you so careless?
I thought the worst they would do is fire me. Who knew they took termination so literally?
Why were you snooping in my office?
Oh. I liked you. I was checking you out.
'Think everybody in this place is here the same reason we are?
'Cause their apartments might be bugged?
I told Teddy about you.
What'd he say?
What'd he say?
"A beautiful geek? What're the chances?"
I felt guilty. 'Cause I "owed so much" to Alice. But even then I was starting to wonder. Is it so great to be so consumed by this one thing that you let another person do your thinking for you? If you have a lucrative skill, it's all anybody wants from you. You grow older but you don't grow up. You turn into --

Great. I knocked off the aglet, as soon as I get a passable version of Skywire we're there.

We rented a loft in Sunnyvale. You know what's the bad part? We can't talk about work anymore. We're competitors! The venture capitalists made us sign like 100 confidentiality forms.
Outpost made me sign 1,000. 'Guess we'll find out what else we have to talk about. Life stuff.

We know all that, Exposition.

I just wanted to be extremely clear so that everyone knows what's going on at any given time. We've just received word that Dr. Evil, the ultimate square, is planning to take over the world.

I'm afraid not. Earlier this week, Dr. Evil escaped from Zedel Edel Prison in Baaden Baaden and now he's planning a trap for you tonight at the Electric Psychedelic Pussycat Swinger's Club in Picadilly Circus here in swinging London.
Just where you'd never think to look for him. We'll be there.
Good luck, Austin.

My God, Vanessa's got a smashing body. I bet she shags like a minx. How do I tell them that because of the unfreezing process, I have no inner monologue? I hope I didn't say that out loud just now.
Yes, well...Agent Kensington will get you set up. She's very dedicated. Perhaps, a little too dedicated. She's got a bit of a bug up her ass. Good luck, Austin, the world's depending on you.

Hello Austin. Hello Vanessa. This is Basil Exposition, from British Intelligence. There's a company in Las Vegas called Virtucon that we think may be linked to Dr. Evil. Many of the Virtucon executives gamble at the hotel/casino where you'll be staying. That's the first place you should look. Well, I'm off to the chat rooms.
Thank you, Exposition.
Thank you, Exposition.
Oh, and Austin...
Oh, and Austin...
Yes?

Hello, Austin, this is Basil Exposition from British Intelligence. Thank you for confirming the link between Dr. Evil and Virtucon. Find out what part Virtucon plays in something called Project Vulcan. I'll need you and Vanessa to get on that immediately.
Right away, Exposition.
Right away, Exposition.
Where is Vanessa, by the way?
She's working on another lead right now.
Then you'll have to go it alone. Good luck.

Hello, Exposition.
Austin, Vanessa, let me bring you up to speed. Dr. Evil has high- jacked a nuclear warhead from Kreplachistan and is holding the world ransom for one-hundred billion dollars. If the world doesn't pay up in four days, he's threatening to destroy the world.

My God, Austin, what have you done?
That's not your mother, that's a man!
I'm sorry, Basil, I thought she was a man.
Damn it, man! You're talking about my mother!
Damn it, man! You're talking about my mother!
You must admit, she is rather mannish. No offense, but if that's a woman, it looks like she's been beaten with an ugly stick.
All right, Austin, I think you should go.
I think if everyone were honest, they'd confess that the lady looks exactly like a man in drag.

Well, Austin, you've stopped Dr. Evil from destroying the world with his subterranean nuclear probe, and somehow you and Agent Kensington managed to escape unscathed from his evil lair.
I'd say that about sums it up, Exposition.

Not quite, actually. Vanessa, I have something for you.
Congratulations, Field Agent Kensington!
Austin, I have something for you as well.
Here's the number of my dentist, he's first rate. Ring him up, he'll look after you.
Thanks, Basil. Maybe the Nineties aren't so bad after all.
But, wait, I-- you got me again. Oh, and Austin--

I'm sorry, baby, I'm just not grocking your head space.
Oh forget it. As a fellow player on the international stage, Mr. Powers, I'm sure you'll enjoy watching the curtain fall on the third and final act.
Dr. Evil, do you really expect them to pay?
No, Mr. Powers, I expect them to die. Even after they pay me the money, I'm still going to melt all the cities of the world with hot magma. All right, guard, begin the unnecessarily Slow-Moving Dipping Mechanism.
I've got you, Dr. Evil!
Well done, Mr. Powers. We're not so different, you and I. It's true, you're British, and I'm Belgian. You have a full head of hair, mine is slightly receding. You're thin, I'm about forty pounds overweight. OK, we are different, I'm not making a very good point. However, isn't it ironic, Mr. Powers, that the very things you stand for-- swinging, free love, parties,

No, man, what we swingers were rebelling against were uptight squares like you, whose bag was money and world domination. We were innocent, man.

I understand that, Mr. Powers, but let me be perfectly clear with you, perhaps to the point of being insulting. I will never have sex with you, ever.

I'm going to use a cover name. It's important that it be a generic name so that we don't draw attention to ourselves.
I can't see a bloody thing.
Oh, I forgot to tell you, they're prescription X-ray glasses. I have very bad astigmatism.
Why did you leave so soon?
That cat Number Two has an X-ray eyepatch. I get bad vibes from him, man. Listen, we should go back to the room, but first I have to go to the naughty chair and see a man about a dog.
Good morning, luv, who are you on the phone with?
Do you want to talk to him?
Good morning, Vanessa! I hope you have on clean underwear.
Why?
Why?
We've got a doctor's appointment-- an evil doctor's appointment.
A limousine has just pulled up.
Let me see.
Hello, hello. That's Dr. Evil's cat.

I'm not. I'm the sensible one. I'm always the designated driver.
I can't. You're drunk.

Really, Austin!
Look at her hands, baby! Those are carpenter's hands.
Austin, may I have a word with you?
Of course, luv.
Of course, luv.
Listen, I know I'm just being neurotic, but I can't shake this suspicious feeling about that Italian secretary, Ms. Fagina.

It makes me feel so small to give into these insecurities, but I can't help but

Don't be sorry. You're right to be suspicious. I shagged her. I shagged her rotten.

You just don't get it, do you, Austin? Good night. Welcome to the Nineties, you're going to be very lonely.
Hello, luv.
Thirty years of political and social upheaval. The fall of the Berlin wall, a female Prime Minister of England, the abolishment of Apartheid, a fascinating tapestry of human strum und drang.

I'll tell him. By the way, I've decided we should keep our relationship strictly professional.
Since I've been unfrozen, I've had a rancid taste in my mouth. Do you have a piece of gum?
Do you think she's prettier than I?

No! Don't lay your hang-ups on me, Vanessa. You're being very trippy.
No! Don't lay your hang-ups on me, Vanessa. You're being very trippy.
I'm looking at you, and the whole time I can't help thinking you had your willie inside her hootchie-kooch.
Austin, we don't look anything like our photo badges.
Don't worry, baby. I picked up a mind control technique during my travels to India. I learned it from my guru, the late Guru Shastri, a chaste man who mysteriously died of a disease that had all the hallmarks of syphilis. Just watch me. Watch me, now.
Thank God, Austin, we made it.
Yes, act naturally and we'll split this scene the way we came in, Vanessa.
Does that make you horny?
Not now, Austin.
First, I plan to soil myself. Then, I plan to regroup and think about the next move. Any thoughts?
Sadly, no. Hold on! I always keep this on me just in case.
All right, I get it. I have bad teeth. You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.
No, no, no. We'll use the floss to get to the ledge.
No, no, no. We'll use the floss to get to the ledge.

Listen, Vanessa, whatever happens, I just want you to know that I feel bad about shagging that Italian girl. I had a sip of sake and all of the sudden, I don't know what happened.

Everything seems to be in order.
Hey, wait a minute--
Here, have a piece of gum.

Where did you learn to shoot?
Commander, this is Slater in SoWest Com Three. We have a potential bogey with erratic vectoring and an unorthodox entry angle.
Is it one of ours?

Oh my God, he's back.

Commander, I have to log it...
That's a direct order. You didn't see a thing!
But my design was perfect! Your autonomic functions were shut down, and even though your arm wasn't frozen, the aging was retarded, therefore your right arm is only slightly older than the left.
Can't you see I'm only half a man? Look at me, I'm a freak!
But Dr. Evil, all you need to do is-- --work with this tennis ball. Squeeze it for twenty minutes a day. A few months of that and it'll be just as strong as the other arm...
And look what you've done to Mr. Bigglesworth!
We could not anticipate feline complications due to the reanimation process&emdash;

Ahhhhhhhhh!
Let this be a reminder to you all that this organization will not tolerate failure.

You shot me right in the arm! Why did--
Remember when we froze your semen, you said that if it looked like you weren't coming back to try and make you a son so that a part of you would live forever?
Yes.
Yes.
Well, after a few years, we got sort of impatient. Dr. Evil, I want you to meet your son.

Austin Powers is getting too close. He must be neutralized. Any suggestions?
Ya wohl-- I mean, yes wohl, Herr Doctor. I have created the ultimate weapon to defeat Austin Powers. Bring on the Fembots!
Breathtaking, Frau. These automated strumpets are the perfect bait for the degenerate Powers.
These are the latest word in android replicant technology. Lethal, efficient, brutal. And no man can resist their charms. Send in the soldiers!
Quite impressive.
Thank you, Herr Doctor.
Thank you, Herr Doctor.
I like to see girls of that caliber. By caliber, I mean both the barrel size of their guns and the high quality of their character... Forget it.
Release the sharks! All the sharks have had laser beams attached to their heads. I figure every creature deserves a warm meal.
Dr. Evil?
Dr. Evil?
Yes, what is it? You're interrupting my moment of triumph.
Yes, what is it? You're interrupting my moment of triumph.
It's about the sharks. Since you were frozen, they've been placed on the Endangered Species List. We tried to get some, but it will take months to clear up the red tape.

Right. Mr. Powers, we're going to lower you in a tank of piranhas with laser beams attached to their heads.
What is it now?
Well, we experimented with lasers, but you would be surprised at how heavy they are. They actually outweighed the piranha themselves, and the fish, well, they sank to the bottom and died.

That was great, Mr. Keon, Dave. Thank you. OK, group, we have two new member. Say hello to Scott and his father, Mr.... Ehville?
Evil, actually, Doctor Evil.
No, the boy's right. I really am evil.
Don't be so hard on yourself. You're here, that's what's important. A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step.
Actually, the boy's quite astute. I am trying to kill him. My Evil Associates have cautioned against it, so here he is, unfortunately, alive.
We've heard from Scott, now let's hear from you.

I haven't seen you my whole life and now you show up and want a relationship? I hate you!
But Scott, who's going to take over the world when I die?
Not me.
An evil vet?
No. Maybe, like, work in a petting zoo or something.

Scott my boy, come here. How was your day?
Well, me and a buddy went to the video arcade in town and, like, they don't speak English right, and so my buddy gets into a fight, and he goes 'hey, quit hassling me cause I don't speak French or whatever', and the other guy goes something in Paris talk, and I go 'um, just back off' and he goes 'get out' and I

Why are you feeding him? Why don't you just kill him?

One more peep out of you and you're grounded. Let's begin.
Fine. Whatever. Mutated, ill-tempered sea bass it is. Come, let's return to dinner. Close the tank.
Aren't you going to watch them? They'll get away!
Aren't you going to watch them? They'll get away!
No, we'll leave them alone and not actually witness them dying, and we'll just assume it all went to plan.

No, Scott. You just don't get it, do you?
Come, everyone, let us repair to the main chamber. Project Vulcan is about to begin. Scott, are you coming?
I don't want to.
I don't want to.
Don't you want to see what Daddy does for a living?

We also own the Franklin mint, which makes decorative hand-painted theme plates for collectors. Some plates, like the Gone With The Wind series, have gone up in value as much as two-hundred and forty percent, but, as with any investment, there is some risk involved.
Gentlemen, I have a plan. It's called blackmail. The Royal Family of Britain are the wealthiest landowners in the world. Either the Royal Family pays us an exorbitant amount of money, or we make it look like Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, has had an affair outside of marriage and, therefore, they would have to divorce.
Um, Dr. Evil, Prince Charles did have an affair. He admitted it, and they are now divorced, actually.
People have to tell me these things. I've been frozen for thirty years, throw me a bone here. OK, no problem. Here's my second plan. Back in the Sixties I had a weather changing machine that was in essence a sophisticated heat beam which we called a "laser." Using this laser, we punch a hole in the protective layer around the Earth, which we
Umm, that also has already happened.
Right. Oh, hell, let's just do what we always do. Let's hijack some nuclear weapons and hold the world hostage. Gentlemen, it's come to my attention that a breakaway Russian Republic called Kreplachistan will be transferring a nuclear warhead to the United Nations in a few days. Here's the plan. We get the warhead, and we hold the world ransom... ...FOR ONE MILLION DOLLARS!
Don't you think we should ask for more than a million dollars? A million dollars isn't that much money these days.
All right then... ...FIVE MILLION DOLLARS!
Virtucon alone makes over nine billion dollars a year.
Oh, really? One-hundred billion dollars. OK, make it happen. Anything else?
Oh, hello Vanessa. How was the flight?
Great.
Great.
How's Austin?
How's Austin?
He's asleep.
He's asleep.
You didn't...
You didn't...
Oh, God no, I made him sleep on the couch.
I'm proud of you.
Why?
Why?
Because you managed to resist Austin Power's charms.
Well, God knows he tried, but I've been rather firm with him, Mummy. You didn't tell me he was so obsessed with sex. It's bizarre.
You can't judge him by modern standards. He's very much a product of his times. In my day he could have any woman he wanted.

You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.

Did you ever...

Of course not. I was married to your father.
Of course not. I was married to your father.
Did you ever want to?
Did you ever want to?
Austin is very charming, very debonair. He's handsome, witty, has a knowledge of fine wines, sophisticated, a world-renowned photographer. Women want him, men want to be him. He's a lover of love-- every bit an International Man of Mystery.
You didn't answer my question, Mum.
I know. Let me just say this: Austin was the most loyal and caring friend I ever had.
No, it's been too long. Best to leave things alone.
I'm on with a friend! Look, I'd better go. I love you.
I'm on with a friend! Look, I'd better go. I love you.

We don't judge here.

OK. Well, I just really met my Dad for the first time three days ago. He was partially frozen for thirty years. I never knew him growing up. He comes back and now he wants me to take over the family business.

I don't wanna take over the family business.
What do you want to do, Scott?
I don't know. I was thinking, maybe I'd be a vet or something, cause I like animals and stuff.
We don't label people here, Scott.
No, he's really evil.
No, he's really evil.
Scott.
I just think, like, he hates me. I really think he wants to kill me.
OK, Scott, no one really wants to "kill" anyone here. They say it, but they don't mean it.
We're not yet open for business, I'm afraid.

How long have I been here?
Three days.

So I'm still ...
Would that I could say the Same.
Ah, but you haven't see the real me. Watch closely ...
I've come to apply for membership in Brolly --
You don't get rain like you used to in England. A good shower that's the ticket. Stiffens resolve, puckers the spirit, quells the namby-pamby in a man.
I so agree. How did you acquire a taste for it?
Out in India. So character-forming for the British. Not the heat. Good Lord, no. The rain, dash it. A good monsoon. Fifteen inches overnight. A whole week of lovely rain. I remember one summer in Jaipur ...

Have we met?

You mean you don't recall??
Ah, beautiful. Just as he promised.

There, look!
Mrs. Peel ... Come quickly. Brolly's been betrayed! I'll tell you everything ... The weather's getting worse and worse ... they're after me ... coming for me ... come quickly!
Sir August...? What now?
May I help you, madam ...
Mr. John Steed, please.

I'm afraid that's impossible.

Quite a collection.
If nature gives a man a collector's mind, it doesn't matter what he collects. Butterflies. Old China. Penny farthings. A true collector grows more obsessive as the years pass.
Your voice -- it's so familiar ...
We have met ...
Congratulations, Mrs. Peel. You have been a worthy opponent. You have tracked us down. You are within an ace of winning.
This isn't a game.

Close. We're so hush-hush, even we know nothing about it. Now let's see, there's coconut cake, date and walnut; I recommend the rum baba ...
Hmmm ...
Hmmm ...
Looks like rain, Steed...
My number two. Special assignments. She's --

Something strange is happening. And whoever knows about it doesn't want us to find out.

Welcome to mobile H.Q. Weather's turning quite nasty. Sir August was blown to smithereens. Along with half of Banffshire. The Ministry's worried.
He tried to warn us ...
Would it be possible to use it for military purposes?
Directed by laser. Bounced by satellite. Quite possible.

After the cold war ...
I resign.

Good luck ... Peter ... Emma.

You.

One very small thing. A diamond 'cyclone' chip. A thousand times more information on a fraction of the size. If I possess that, my powers would be unlimited. My dear half-brother was developing it. But he suspected sabotage. He gave the chip to ... you, 'Mrs.' Peel. I want you. But also your ring.
The missing piece of the jigsaw. I tried to get you to give it to me as Peter; I tried to steal it from you as Dr. Darling. As myself I'll be a bit less subtle. With this ring my plan will be complete.
How Wagnerian ... Do you mean to say you've waited all these years because you couldn't create a chip on your own? That would have amused Peter.

You're accusing Mrs. Peel of killing her own husband?

I'm totally blown away. You're getting married. It seems like only yesterday I showed you how to have oral sex.
Deb, I want to throw you a shower.
Look at that guy. What a hunk.
Check out the other guy's buns.
Debbie... I don't believe it. I'm so excited.
Bobbie, what are you talking about?
Bobbie, what are you talking about?
O'Neill just tole me. It's sooo great... I don't believe it.
He still thinks I'm going with him. I'm going to break the news to him tomorrow.
He's not gonna be happy. And your parents can't be too thrilled either.
He's not gonna be happy. And your parents can't be too thrilled either.
No. As far as they're concerned the only good Rick is a dead Rick. But I don't care... it's my decision.
What do you think's gonna go on at the guys' party?
They'll probably get drunk, and watch dirty movies. But don't worry about the dirty movies.

Too bad, man, that blows my chance to be Ambassador to France.
Man, you're losing your audience.
Okay... This is it... I'm getting married.

Cole, what the hell are you doing?
She's mine!
He and Debbie stand outside the theater, which is a multi-plex cinema. Fourteen movie theaters under one roof. Prominent is a sign which reads: "24 HOUR 3D FESTIVAL!" Cole drags Debbie into one of the theaters. The gang runs up to the theaters.
Fan out and look for them.

If it were me, I'd reason with him first. Then, if that failed... ...I'd take more persuasive action.
Thanks for the advise, sir.
Keep me informed.
So, he's playing hard ball. Well, two can play that game. Go after him. Stop at nothing. You hear me?

Let's get naked.

This has been quite a night. Here's a thought. Why don't we go home and give our private parts a workout?
You're so romantic...
If I were you, I'd worry less about the shower and more about Rick's bachelor party.
Ilene, why would I want to do that? I trust Rick.
Ilene, why would I want to do that? I trust Rick.
Of course you do. I trusted my ex, Mel, too. Cousin, I can only talk from experience. What do you think they do at these parties, have tea and play scrabble?

Look, you heard what those hookers said. They were supposed to go to a bachelor party.

I know what I'm doing... Go!
I'm using the same caterer for the shower I had for our Christmas party last year.
Great, Mom.
Why is Cole here?
You know your father enjoys his company.
A strange wang right in my palm.
Ilene, we don't really know that.
What kind of job? I'm a housewife.
Quiet, Mother.
I hope Ilene's all right.
I hope those guys are all right.
Ed, we're so glad you could come over at the last minute and judge our little beauty pageant.
My pleasure, Al... Always happy to help out in a pinch... Excuse me. I better call my service... tell them where I am.
Congratulations on your daughter's wedding. Who's she marrying?
A real turd.

Well... hope she'll be very happy.
Great bathing suit.
I think I screwed that one once.
Thanks for helping us out, Ed. We appreciate it.
Any time, Al.

Hey. I'm sorry. You want girls. I'll give you girls.
Give him the works.
That's more like it.
Screw you... Screw that... Don't jerk me around. You promised me 1500 seats for the Police Concert... 1500, not fifteen!... Screw that... Screw you -- Screw Sting. Hi, guys.

Okay... We're all here. Rick, what's the big announcement?
All right, gentlemen, I'm not gonna sugar-coat this thing. I've known you guys since grade school, so I'm gonna give it to you straight from the hip... right from the shoulder... without beating around the bush... Nothing fancy, just the plain, hard facts... tell it like it is.
Wait a minute. You been living with Debbie! Why do you want to get married?
Because I love her. What can I tell you?
Sounds swell... I'm really touched. And my getting married's not gonna change a thing between me and my pals. We're still gonna go bowling on Tuesdays, play cards on Fridays and wear women's clothes on Sunday night. I love you guys... I always will.
Let's have a toast.
Give the guy air. Everyone to a neutral corner.
What's going on?
It's true.
This place should have been wall to wall tits by now.

Gary, how we doing, big stallion?
Rick, I really think I'm in love.

Larry, you and your wife got problems?

My marriage is the worst. All crap. A big pile of shit.
Maybe your marriage should lay off grains for a while.

C'mon, Larry. Be good for you.
C'mon, Larry. Be good for you.
I just want to be alone.

All right. Now, there's milk and cookies in the refrigerator. Go to bed right after "Falcon Crest."
Lar... sometimes when people are mad they say things they don't mean.
No, she hates me... I want to end everything here... now.
You okay?
Yeah, I guess so.
Yeah, I guess so.
Really?
Really?
Yeah. I see you're right. C'mon, let's party.
What the hell are you doing?
I'm trying to slash my wrists.

Ha, ha, ha.
Ha, ha, ha.
No, have fun first. Then laugh. Now, forget about marriage for a while. Go party.
Hi, guys. We brought back a friend.
It's Bullwinkle.
It's my fault. He's dead because... I left those drugs...
It's really not all your fault. I was talking to Mike earlier and he had a lot of problems. Personal things, you know. Made some bad investments. At least now he's peaceful...
Are any of those right?
This is the Park View Hotel. I'm the Hotel Manager. Are you looking for someone?
This is the Park View Hotel. I'm the Hotel Manager. Are you looking for someone?
Yes, you. We're looking for our room... 1002.
It's on the tenth floor.
What do you know, they moved it. Catch you later.
Keep your voices down. This is a respectable establishment. We don't go for any funny business here. Just then a GUY with a Moosehead Beer hat and TWO GUYS in a moose costume pass him and enter the elevator with the boys.
I see what you mean... You're a beautiful guy. And you're doing a damn good job.
You're all under arrest. Open up!
Your attention, please. May I be the first to say, It's a raid!
Oops!
All right, who serves?
Rick, hit the ball easier, son. You don't have to kill it.
Can't I just maim it a little?
Well, I have to admit my game's a little rusty, but I love polo. It's unrelenting, a constant challenge to the senses. Really a beautiful experience.
Rick, I want to cut through the b.s.
Rick, I want to cut through the b.s.
I'd love that.
I'd love that.
Good. I think you're an asshole. No, let me correct that, an immature asshole. Which is fine, except you're marrying my daughter and I'm afraid my grandchildren are going to be little assholes.

Mr. Thomerson, I...

Let me finish. Debbie's an adult. She can do what she wants. But if you want your marriage to last, you're going to have to change some things about yourself. If I may make some suggestions...
Let me finish. Debbie's an adult. She can do what she wants. But if you want your marriage to last, you're going to have to change some things about yourself. If I may make some suggestions...
Feel free.
Feel free.
First, you're a slob. You have to dress for success. Second, your outlook on life...
Welcome, welcome, one and all.
Rick!
Rick!
Oh, no!
The end.
No sob story is going to change my mind.
Ebbie. Ger... umph... lable...
Of course, sir. That explains it. Leather is a very good source of vitamin E.
Er... perhaps we ought to stop now.
No. Let's at least finish the set.
Girls, why don't we go inside for lunch. Boys, would you mind bringing in that lemonade?
In a second... And you're irresponsible. Show some initiative, try to better yourself, stop showing off, actions speak louder than words.
The thought of that person marrying my daughter makes me want to upchuck.
You can tell a man by his friends.
Ed... you're kinky!
The phone made me do it!
The phone made me do it!
You've been having strange sex...!
You've been having strange sex...!
No, Brett, I...
No, Brett, I...
It's all right... So have I.
How are we doing? My name is O'Neill. And you are...?
Klupner. Mrs. Klupner.
Klupner. Mrs. Klupner.
Mrs.?
Mrs.?
I'm separated.
I'm separated.
Then there is a God. Why don't we take that baby picture.
I'm getting one heck of a glare off your dress there. Could you undo a few buttons?
Of course.
Where'd she go?
She probably had sex scheduled for 12:30. O'Neill, let's pick up the guys for a drink... I have major news to announce.
Where the hell is he?
Knowing Larry, he probably missed the flight.
What's the matter?
Nothing... Let's get crazy!
We'll spend an hour with "Nymphos Without Pants"...
Olivier's in that, right?
Olivier's in that, right?
Then it's on to the real thing.
Excuse me, but this is as arousing as a stroll through the Vatican.
This isn't right.
Don't you love it when old friends stop by?
Hey, I'm starved... Let's go get something to eat. We'll bring back food for everybody.

I'm not really hungry.

C'mon. I insist.
What the hell is that?
My gift to you.
My gift to you.
Under the table!
Under the table!
The best table in the house.
I think you'll enjoy this table.
So long, Father.
I don't get it. Why didn't you go for it just now?
I don't know. Maybe it's because I love Debbie or maybe it's hard for me to get off in a place that smells like egg salad. I'm not sure.
Rick, I'm concerned.
About what?
About what?
This is your bachelor party. You haven't had sex with anyone yet.
This is your bachelor party. You haven't had sex with anyone yet.
Get a few drinks into me, we'll dance and see what happens.

If I'm not out in a half hour, send for the paramedics.
If I'm not out in a half hour, send for the paramedics.
That's the old Rick!
How'd it go?
Put it to you this way -- you're gonna have to pry her out of the bed with a spatula, mister.
Put it to you this way -- you're gonna have to pry her out of the bed with a spatula, mister.
I'm proud of you, lad.
Who was that?
I don't know.
I don't know.
What's this?
What's this?
Got me.
How 'bout this?
Still drawing a blank.
He look familiar?
Very.
Very.
C'mon. Get the hookers in a circle. We better put Cochise out of business.
Now, don't get into any trouble.
Take care.
Hey, you guys...
Who's your friend?
How about this, a Trojan donkey.
And here's Mike's partner, in more ways than one. A gal who doesn't think happiness ends with primates. The very lovely, Miss Desiree...
What are you going to do about it?
What can I do? I'm dead. Debbie's going to go crazy and end the whole thing.
What can I do? I'm dead. Debbie's going to go crazy and end the whole thing.
I'll stop him... You stall him.
Reach out and snort someone.
I'm saved. Let's party!
Guess who's here? Another surprise guest.
Who?
Who?
Debbie.
Debbie.
My Debbie?
My Debbie?
What's with her costume?
I don't know... Go up to her, make like you don't know her and send her into the other bedroom.
You got it.
You always were sneaky, Stan, very sneaky.
Rick, marriage will be good for you. It's done wonders for me.
Rick, marriage will be good for you. It's done wonders for me.
True, you're a lot handsomer now. Don't you have enough blood already?
True, you're a lot handsomer now. Don't you have enough blood already?
You won't miss a thing about being single... The wild parties, the different girls every night, running around like a maniac... God, I miss that.
You won't miss a thing about being single... The wild parties, the different girls every night, running around like a maniac... God, I miss that.
Stan, you're depressing me... Hey, I didn't know you were going to fill 'er up. Just take a couple of gallons, okay?
That's an even trade... a cotton ball for all my blood.
Okay, Rick, all finished. I can't wait for that bachelor party... I need the action.
Nah, that's okay. My brother has to look up old people's asses all day long. Let's give him a break.
Right. Give me the will to live. Let me go first.
Thanks a lot, that was the best. You're next.
Nah, not yet. Look, you're my older brother. I need some advice here. What's the deal with marriage? What can I expect?
Nah, not yet. Look, you're my older brother. I need some advice here. What's the deal with marriage? What can I expect?
Well, the first month it's great. The second month things calm down a little. By the third month you're looking through your old girlfriends' phone numbers; by the fourth month you're numb; by the fifth month, hopefully the football season starts.

Thanks, Stan, you've been a lot of help.
Oh... it's... er... the guys from the beer convention. We're bringing them to the party.
Great. I was wondering, how do you guys go to the bathroom in that thing?
You're late again, Rick.
I know, Sister, but I have a very good excuse.
I know, Sister, but I have a very good excuse.
There can be no excuse for tardiness.
There can be no excuse for tardiness.
You're absolutely right. I should never have stopped to save that drowning infant. I'm just weak, Sister; I'm so weak.
Sister, do you ever get lonely after vespers? If you do, why don't you give me a call. I'm in the book.
Get going, Rick... you're late enough as it is.
Get going, Rick... you're late enough as it is.
Right... Think it over.
How the hell are we supposed to get this donkey inside?
I don't know.
I don't know.
What? I thought you told me you had it all figured out.
What? I thought you told me you had it all figured out.
Maybe I did... I don't remember.
Maybe I did... I don't remember.
I'd love to get you in an operating room. Just once.
Can you believe how perfect it fits?
Yeah. Who'd have thought they'd both be a size 138 regular.
Oh these moments do try me...
Be gentle.
Wash it to the windows?
No, we'll hit the son of a bitch head on.
No, we'll hit the son of a bitch head on.
It's gonna flash, Stevie. We gotta get behind it.
It's gonna flash, Stevie. We gotta get behind it.
Nah, listen to it. It's a pussy. It'll just steam on us. It won't flash. Go high in the ceiling.
That's Franny. She likes firemen.
Tim, fill out the alarm card. Clean the pipe poles, wipe down the ladders and hang some hose.
Goddamn it, Stephen, lay off! You stupid dumbshit, you never know when to fucking quit, do you? You ever wonder why your career's in the fucking toilet? Why you're gonna be stuck a Lt. for life?
No. I need a drink.
You know Knowlton pretty well?
Yeah...
Yeah...
Kind of an asshole, wasn't he?
Biggest in two battalions.
We're gonna be okay, man...
Adcox, go with Pengelly and check the other side.
It isn't safe, man. Don't go splittin' us up. Not with this one.
It isn't safe, man. Don't go splittin' us up. Not with this one.
-- What the hell's the matter with you? You always check the other side. I haven't got time for bullshit right now, okay? We got a job here.

Let me take the lead, Stephen...

Goddamn it Adcox! Just do your fucking job!
Aw man, Stephen, listen to me...
-- What the fuck were you thinking, huh? Burning people? You're a fireman.
-- What the fuck were you thinking, huh? Burning people? You're a fireman.
They were killing firemen, man. When Sally showed me what was in Swayzak's files... They were my friends, I had to do it. I had to do it for the department.
-- Knock it off!
-- You can't let him turn you against your friends, man --
...What do you want me to do, Stephen? Talk to me. What am I supposed to do?
There's a fire. We've got a job here. Let's get on with it.
You stupid son of a bitch! What the fuck are you doing!
Stevie... I...
Hey, baby McCaffrey. First one's the clincher. You did okay.
My Lt. might have something to say about that.
My Lt. might have something to say about that.
Ah, everybody screws up some, Brian. You're working for the toughest Lt. on the job. Saw him once pick up a probie he thought was moving too slow and throw him into a burning building. It's just bad luck you're family.

John, when you're in there... in the fire... do you ever see...
Is he...
He's alive.
Did you do it for Tim?
That was an accident! Jesus Christ, why did you have to go in there so fucking early? Why didn't you listen to me!
You gotta let me finish --
Just come down, John. Just --
Just come down, John. Just --

It doesn't go like that.
Who asked you?
Who asked you?
If you do it like that it'll open in the fire. Then you'll get burned and DIE.
Well, look what we have here. Nice costume. Rent it?
I want to thank you for coming to my graduation, Stephen. It was a great inspiration to me.
I want to thank you for coming to my graduation, Stephen. It was a great inspiration to me.
So you're going to fight fires now, huh?
Doesn't work on you. See ya around, little brother.
Not likely.
Not likely.
Well, see you're wrong already. Had a talk with Chief Fitzgerald, and we decided in the interest of brotherly love, that maybe you shouldn't be way over on the other side of town. So starting tomorrow, your assigned to company 17. My company. One case of scotch, you're getting cheap in your old age, Brian...
I like what you've done with the place.
It's comin' along... want a beer?
Been ripping off fire stations?
It's old stuff Adcox gave me that the department was going to throw out anyway. Still good enough though for this tub.
My God, an actual operating 8-track.
What, you've never seen one before?
What, you've never seen one before?
In the Field Museum once.

People actually used to pay you for this?
Millions, Stephen -- And sexual favors.

Yeah? What about Laura --
Yeah? What about Laura --
That was never proved.
Why'd you come here, Brian?
I wanted to know why you messed with my station assignment. I mean, is this really gonna have to one of those big brother -- little brother "you broke my GI Joe and I'm still pissed" games?
I wanted to know why you messed with my station assignment. I mean, is this really gonna have to one of those big brother -- little brother "you broke my GI Joe and I'm still pissed" games?
What is it with you, man, huh? How do you manage to keep coming up with new and amazing ways to screw up? That scotch bullshit? Am I really supposed to believe you came crawling back home because you suddenly felt heart strings moan for the family biz? You were bankrupt, man.

Hey! You don't know me --
Hey! You don't know me --
I know you cold, Brian. The scary thing is, you probably could have faked it for awhile. But you see, in this job there's no place to hide. Isn't like selling log cabins. You have a bad day here -- someone dies. And that's not fucking good enough. Want another beer?

So that's it? Big bad brother's gonna ride my ass till I cough blood?
Big bad brother is going to treat you like any other probie -- that I don't think is going to make it.
There's only so much technology can do. Thanks for the beer.
Thanks for the speakers.
Y'know, I told myself a million times I didn't want to be a fireman. I said bullshit to that line about tradition and family legacy. I know I split, and I know how you felt...
Yeah, you know. You know what it felt like.
Yeah, you know. You know what it felt like.
I gotta do this, Stephen. I gotta know.
I gotta do this, Stephen. I gotta know.
I think you're gonna find out, Brian. Don't be late tomorrow.
Ya love it, probie?
I'm in heaven, Lt.
I'm in heaven, Lt.
Hook us up to a stand-pipe.
Y'know, you got an awful short memory for direct orders. I told you to stay beside me.
-- C'mon, Stephen.
-- C'mon, Stephen.
-- You split the team, man. And what was that crap with the standpipe? You'd think you and a hose were never introduced before.
Goddamn it Stephen!
-- I told you to stay next to me!
-- I told you to stay next to me!
-- I was doin' it! I was up there fucking doin' it. You don't know, man, you don't know what I did!
-- I was doin' it! I was up there fucking doin' it. You don't know, man, you don't know what I did!
What you did was drop the ball, Probie. Get that right.
C'mon ladies, let's roll some hose...
-- Never mind.
Thanks.
Brian -- -- See ya tonight.
Hey.
Hey.
So you got a 'roid going with Jackson or what?
Nah, he's nothin'. It's just sometimes... sometimes you just gotta punch somebody out, y'know?
Look, Brian, a photographer. Maybe I can get on the cover of LIFE magazine, too.
C'mon, let's crawl home.
Jesus, it's too damn bright in here... Like a goddamn spotlight... I'm goin' blind...
This?
This?
Yeah... too bright...
Roll the hose.
What, are you kidding? By myself?
What, is it the stairs? Christ, I'll let you win next time.
You got a problem with drilling, probie?
You got a problem with drilling, probie?
No, Lt., I don't have a problem with drilling. But let's just have one drill. Not one for the company and one for me.
No, Lt., I don't have a problem with drilling. But let's just have one drill. Not one for the company and one for me.
Roll the hose.
Ready?
Christ, Stephen, let's wait for the hose team...
Christ, Stephen, let's wait for the hose team...
Listen to it, Brian... Jump when I say... It won't get us.
You okay?
I waited... I would have fucking waited...
I waited... I would have fucking waited...
That's not what it's about, Brian. The point is there was a kid in there. And what if there'd been two? I went in because that's what I do. It's my way. It's dad's way. It isn't everybody's way.

Dad's way? Where did he tell you that? In a fucking seance?
Dad's way? Where did he tell you that? In a fucking seance?
You said you wanted to know something, Brian. What did you learn today? What do you say, Brian, huh? Time to move on?
Look, you are sorta making yourself fair game.
Thanks for the insight.
Thanks for the insight.
Brian, look --
Brian, look --
Just leave me alone, okay?
...Not now, Brian.
Had to take on another fire bare- handed, huh? Had to be fucking myth man in there instead of looking out for your probie. Is that what happened? Is it, Stephen?

I had that fire. He didn't listen!

Just... Just wanted to say hello...

Look, Stephen, maybe we can talk about this some other --
Look, Stephen, maybe we can talk about this some other --
-- Okay, so you don't like me. You don't like everything I've done. What, because I wasn't such a genius the way I raised you? Jesus Christ, dad was gone, what was I supposed to do? You tell me, what the fuck was I supposed to do?!
It's okay, Stephen, I --
-- I tried, y'know? Helen's right. I don't have all the answers, but goddamn it, I've got some. Look, you're gonna do what you have to, and maybe I shouldn't have gotten in the way. I'm your brother, not your father. Go on. You gotta go somewhere? Go...
I saw it.
Saw what?
Saw what?
When dad died, I saw another fire...
When dad died, I saw another fire...
Everybody did.

Sometimes right when you're looking at them.
Oh God, Stephen, what's going on with you?
I don't know, Brian... I don't know...
-- Stephen, wait a minute. I gotta talk to you. It's Adcox, he's --

"You never know till the fire stares you down if you're gonna be --"
"You never know till the fire stares you down if you're gonna be --"
Oh shut up, huh? I think I broke my goddamn arm...
Don't tell them about Adcox... Don't let 'em...

What, you think I just dried up and blew away when you left? The world does turn once in awhile Brian, even without your permission.
Well, if nothing else, it's nice to know we can still be friends.
I don't want to be your friend, Brian.
With grenadine, right?
When I was twenty.
When I was twenty.
Oooh, very sophisticated. Having fun?
Look, I'm not the same girl who had nothing better to do than wrap her legs around you on a Saturday night. This isn't about fun. I'm working here.

-- All I know is that his programs are getting firemen hurt.
-- All I know is that his programs are getting firemen hurt.
Bullshit. Marty's plan is only about efficiency. I've got two cousins on the job, you think I'd work for him if I didn't believe in it?
What was that? Oh man, you have picked up a few moves since John Paul II Boulevard.
Yeah, well I like to think I'm just a little past hanging out on JP II watching the Irish pick fights and Litwalks barf in the planters.
Yeah, well I like to think I'm just a little past hanging out on JP II watching the Irish pick fights and Litwalks barf in the planters.

Look, I didn't mean to take a piece out of you back there, I just thought you'd call when you came back. You didn't and... Don't blow it just because of this garbage between us.
Look, I didn't mean to take a piece out of you back there, I just thought you'd call when you came back. You didn't and... Don't blow it just because of this garbage between us.
Hey, sorry if I made you look bad in front of your boss. But I'm not gonna be a poster boy for him, I'm trying to do something here. There's five hundred smoke eaters in this room that do that stuff for real every day. Tell Swayzak to talk to one of them.
I've been thinking about what you said the other night... If the offer's still on the table, I'd like to talk about it.
...Okay. I'll arrange things with your assignment captain. Marty's a good man, Brian.
...Okay. I'll arrange things with your assignment captain. Marty's a good man, Brian.

I could use a date.
Yeah? Well, maybe I can fit it in...
Hi.
Hey... So are you dating your boss or what?

Yeah, but it doesn't take Albert Einstein just to figure out if these guys were killed by accidents or not.
Jesus, give him a break. There isn't enough proof yet to go public. Sure, we found some chemical shit we think somebody dumped in the plugs to torch 'em, and we've maybe figured out why backdrafts, but you can't rush this stuff. Not 'till it's locked.

In a dinosaur kinda way, yeah.
Thanks for the invite.
Got anything to drink in there?
Got anything to drink in there?
Oh, there might be something stashed away for emergencies.
This is one of the oldest fire stations in the city. Lotta tradition locked up in here. What do you think?
Homey.
Homey.
See that trap door up there? That used to lead to the hay loft when they had horse-drawn engines. It was pretty different then... but kinda the same, y'know?

I wanted to be a good one.
Well, our specimen here is your basic standard issue piece of primary suppression equipment. This area is the pumping panel, which controls the rate of liquid insertion into the hose.
Uh huh.

Y'know, four years ago I was working in a bakery. Two years ago I was bringing Marty coffee and he didn't even know my name. I run that office now. Marty believed in me and I believe in him. You want me to just throw that away?

What is --
Just take it.
I'm sorry.
That's a dumb thing to say.

You're right.
I think your boss is going to need some spin control.
I quit two days ago, Brian.

I don't have the slightest idea...

I'll see ya around, huh?

It's a small town.
Brian McCaffrey... Oh this is really a treat. Brian McCaffrey. Lost a dad to the animal, huh?
Hey, do I know you?
I'm close... but I can't get who it is...
So you came to me... Well, this is going to be an interesting afternoon after all...
Okay, here's the deal. I'll tell you a story, you tell me one. Fair?
Who's doing this?
Who's doing this?
Your first question should be who isn't. It isn't a spark, Brian. Not enough damage. And an insurance pro? Where's the profit margin?

I don't have a story.
I don't have a story.
Sure you do.
Famous story even. Straight burn. Just an engine and truck first on scene. What did you feel, Brian, when you first got there?
What?
What?
You gotta tell a story too, Brian. It's fair. C'mon, don't think too hard --

I... I thought it was great. I loved it. It was nothing to these guys... medium deal.
Right. Light smoke, low roll. Couple'a civilians hollering -- medium deal. So young fireman Adcox and Captain McCaffrey, they head up stairs, get out on the fire escape -- McCaffrey does the ballsy jump across... what were you feeling, Brian? C'mon, you promised. Be honest. Okay... Guard!

Very good, Brian. -- About your report here. The way to a torch's heart is through his tools. That's how you know him. It's the way he talks to the fire. And to you if you listen.

Trychticholorate.

Good. -- So our two heroes, Adcox and McCaffrey, they go back inside. Only there's another fire in there nobody sees. And it took your dad, didn't it Brian? Did you see him burn?
Who the fuck is doing this?
After it took your dad... the fire... did it look at you Brian? Did it talk to you?...
Oh Jesus Christ...
Not such a far walk after all, is it, Brian?
If it was a joke, sir, you'd be laughing.
You walked out on this academy six years ago. One week to graduation. You think we forgot that? You think I did?

Look, I knew your father, he had a helluva reputation on this job. But that don't mean you get any slack. Swayzak sends you down here, okay, I gotta eat you, that's the rules and I got nothing to say about that. But Swayzak or no, you live with me. Step out of line, and I don't care who knows you, I'll swing the
Where are you going?
Pest control.
-- Shhh.
What are you listening to?
So you were happy here. Warm and cozy and in no hurry... Soot high, clean unburned wall low, indicates slow burn in thermal balance. Find me some glass.
Glass?
Glass?
Do we have a language barrier here? Glass.
Glass found in ignition room is in small, thin pieces, indicating explosion. Lack of discoloration indicates a long, slow burn. Explosion must of come after a slow burn. You little tease... What were you up to you little bastard, huh? What made you that mad? Or scared. It started in this room. Took its time, hung out... but the air ran out. It couldn't
-- Another backdraft.
Temperature in this room was about 2000 degrees, but copper wire in outlet is melted, which requires 5000 degrees. An accidental short in the plug could of created a spark of 7000 degrees, hot enough to melt the wire and start a fire.
No it couldn't.
Uh, I don't think that's in my contract...
I just re-wrote your contract. C'mere...

Ever burned magnesium? It's so hot it takes water molecules and BAMM!
Son of a bitch tears 'em apart just to eat the oxygen. Wouldn't take much at all to melt ten gauge wire. Problem's burnt magnesium leaves a powder trace -- unless you could find something that would eat its residue.
Trychticholorate. Then Swayzak can announce Seagrave was a murder.
Look, it isn't proof, okay? Someone may have put the chemical in the outlet, but we found it as a vapor in Cosgrove's clothes.
And the putty around the door?

Even if it was used to seal the air off, that doesn't explain why someone would go to the trouble of a backdraft. A gun's a helluva lot easier

What?
What?
I got it after we talked to Ronald. Torches. Want to fry the whole goddamn world. But the fires that killed those guys never really burned up much. -- The burns were all lit in outlets surrounded by double firebreaks in the walls. And he made his burns backdrafts.

Why backdrafts. Whoever fried Seagrave and Cosgrove went to a helluva lot of trouble to make sure they died by fire, but also made sure the fire blew itself out.

No. Do that and I guarantee you'll scare him off. I don't want him running away.
What the hell are you doing here?
I'm finished with Swayzak. I'll do whatever you want me to do. I just want to help catch the guy that burned Tim. You gotta give me another shot.
In a word, Brian, what is this job all about?
Fire.
Hey boss, Dekom Trust is owned by Pan Illinois... which is majority controlled by Lakeside Dynamics... which is a division of Windy City Ventures... who's partners are... Alan Seagrave, Donald Cosgrove, and Jeffrey Holcomb.
Son of a bitch. They knew each other.
So Seagrave and Holcomb were accountants...
And Cosgrove. Coppers figured he laundered money for the mob before getting into real estate. They weren't very high on Seagrave, either.

Nice bunch of guys.
Nice bunch of guys.
Who all ended up wearing candles for faces... Swayzak's up to his ass in this somehow. Guy can barely hold a drink in his hand, he's so scared.
This is the copy of Swayzak's manning report that was released. Everybody on this job knows it's bullshit but we could never argue with the numbers. They're all airtight.
Yeah? Airtight?
I've got three different drafts of the same report -- with different numbers that're all over the place. Looks like they were just making it up as they went along.
Did a little check on the consulting firm that wrote the report. They did exactly one job -- Swayzak's manpower study. It's not even really a company. No employees, no directors, just a PO Box.

Well Brian, I guess you can say it's arson now...
How ya feeling?
Did you pull me out?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Did I say thanks?
Did I say thanks?
No.
No.
Just wondering.

I hate hospitals. You're so... so goddamn useless...
So what do you want me to do?
I've been lying here hours... just thinking... We're close... We're not looking in the right place, Brian. This one knows us and we're not looking in the right place...
Your brother was a good man.
Yeah.
Yeah.

Well that's two things to strangle Stephen for. Where is he, anyway?
Stephen's not staying here now, Brian. He moved out last April.
Oh, man, I'm sorry.
You guys ought to try picking up a phone once in awhile.
Yeah. Big fan.

This one's still with the fire department. One of our best investigators, Don Rimgale, is working on a very difficult, visible case right now. We think he could use another pair of hands and you're exactly the kind of guy I want representing us: An authentic hero from a traditional firefighting clan.

Mr. McCaffrey...
Nice boat.

It isn't mine. Let's get a picture.
Mr. McCaffrey... Keeping busy?
Yeah. In fact, I just dropped off a letter to the Times explaining how yesterday's arson announcement was a fabrication by your office. They loved it. And you know what? You were right, my family background in firefighting gave it weight.
Completely out of control.
What the hell are we waiting for?

Man. Something sure put a crimp in his evening.
Backdraft.
Do you have to do that?
Could you believe that fire? Man! First day! There I was, Adcox and me, pullin' that lady right out of the fire's fuckin' throat! I love it here -- No surround and drown for this company. Fighting 17th! Goddamn Stephen's amazing. You see how he took that fire by the balls? I'm gonna be that good some day, you watch.
Y'know what Stephen said to me, right when all the shit was coming hard? "You never know till the moment the fire stares you down if you're just gonna do this job or be great at it".
Ah man, is he usin' that line now on you? What, you think he made that little gem up? Jesus Christ, I used to have to listen to my old man use that every morning.
What?
"Probationary Fireman Brian McCaffrey, on his very first fire, showed the kind of bravery and courage of a veteran firefighter when he risked life and limb to double-check a burning floor alone, emerging victoriously with Anna Rodriguez, a seamstress for the North Shore Clothing Company... McCaffrey first gained prominence as the subject of a 1972 Pulitzer Prize winning photograph taken at the scene of

They ran the residue you scraped from both crispers' front doors. It's a combination of plumber's putty and rayophene gum. Burns almost completely away when you light it.
Putty? On both doors?

There's something else kinda interesting...
Anyway, down here, take a look...
McCaffrey, hold this for us.
See that patch of shirt? We wondered about the discoloration so he ran a spectro. On a lucky shot we picked up some traces of Trychticholorate. Nobody around here had ever heard of it.
Trychticholorate? Alright, it's an absorption catalyst in toxic waste accidents. It's pretty rare, they stopped making it a couple'a years ago.

Investigator...
I'm a little busy right now --
This'll only take a minute. There's two cops outside that want to ask you about this --
I'm gonna need some bread, man. This ain't fair. I'm always here for you, and you can't even take decent care of me. My landlord is bitching like a motherfucker! You're two months behind on the rent, Lieutenant!
Didya ever think of moving to a cheaper apartment? $3,500 a month is crazy, man!
Didya ever think of moving to a cheaper apartment? $3,500 a month is crazy, man!
It's nothing. This is New York, man... Oh -- I forgot. Bowtay needs some cash to buy her new acting headshots out of the developers. It's a good investment, man. She could make serious money!
Brown Downtown... There hasn't been any smoking brown on the street in --
Who said anything about the fucking street. I've got more connects than you have, Lieutenant...
I can't get over what those guys did to her. I just can't.
They're alive, aren't they? Come on, man! Everyone's making such a fucking fuss, just because she's a nun. Just because she wears a penguin suit, the church puts up 50 G for the guys who dared to rape her. Do you think they'd put up a dime if you got raped? Of course not. Or even for your little sister? The virgin? Like shit

Susie's not a virgin anymore.
Susie's not a virgin anymore.
She's fucking nine years old! Jesus Christ.
It's horrible. They burned her breasts with cigarettes. Christ.
Yeah? At least she's alive! I see people get killed every day! Worse yet, tortured first and then killed! The nuns got off easy. Jeez. Cigarette burns. Everyone's all upset about fucking cigarette burns. I'll show you cigarette burns!
The Church is a fucking racket. I know how they operate. I've been part of the racket since the first time some faggot priest spilt water on my head. My Aunt Lu says I was crying all the way through. Yeah, I know their game inside out. Now I'm free of it and I'm gonna stay that way.
I'm not talking about the fucking Church. Fuck the Church. But tell me. Do you believe in God?
I'm not talking about the fucking Church. Fuck the Church. But tell me. Do you believe in God?
What's to believe?
What's to believe?
That Jesus Christ was the Son of God and he came to die for your sins.
People.
You believe that man is the be-all and end-all?
You believe that man is the be-all and end-all?
Yeah.
Yeah.
OK. OK. Fine. But -- do you believe in God?
It's not the drugs, Ariane, it's -- it's someone who wants to kill me. You gotta believe me!
Why?
Christ! Shit! I could kill them all with my bare hands.
Who?
Who?
Those fucking Mob assholes.
C'mere. You got some good blow, right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Then c'mere. I got something for you.
First I'll put your Uptown in the spoon, then, to make it more exciting, I'm gonna add some Downtown. They call this thing a speedball, honey, but then you must know that... First time shooting up?
Nah...
Nah...
Sure it is. You're a virgin. Just like that nun. And I'm gonna rape you.
Can you believe the nerve of this fucking guy? He kills people for fun, and then, he puts up 100 G to bring in some guys who raped a nun. What a sick fuck. Man...
Who?
Who?
A wiseguy. Paying 100 Grand for the rapists if I turn then over direct to him.
But you could do it, baby. We could use the bread...
You mean you could use it.
I got it, man! I will find those kids. And I'll get the 50 G from the Church! Then the kids'll go to jail. I'll be in charge, of course. After a little while, I'll break the fuckers out -- and I'll turn them in to shithead I was just talking to. And pick up his 100 G. No. I'll hit him up for
"The Strawberries"?
"The Strawberries"?
The Mets. So anyway, chalk up another 180 G for the Game. Jesus Christ! That's almost half a million dollars. Ariane! Wait. That's not good enough, I'll ask the shithead for 280 G for the kids. Then it'll be a perfect 500 thousand. Yeah. Perfect. 280 G for the kids. Yeah, it's good I prepared, or I wouldn't have thought to --
How come all those guys who're looking to get 50 from the Church haven't come up with shit? You got some kinda inside track?
I'm a Catholic.
You took the chalice.
Yes.
Yes.
You brought it back to the Church. And then it made it's way back to me, again.
You brought it back to the Church. And then it made it's way back to me, again.
Yes.
Are you all right, honey?
I was gonna bring it back myself.
So what are you doing here?
He wants to know who brought in the chalice.
He wants to know who brought in the chalice.
That's no mystery. Julio and Paolo brought it in, You don't want to hurt those boys, do you? I mean, they sure as Hell have got something coming, but it ain't what the Law wants to give them. You understand? No. How could you understand.
That stuff'll kill you quick, man.

I forgive you.
Why do I dream every night of the whore who brought you water on your road to death? And why have I never forgotten that if she, then I --

Forgive me Father, for I have sinned. It has been two days since my last confession. Father, my sin is a terrible sin. A sin of omission. There was another sin that happened at the same time, and in the same place, but my sin I think was graver stil.
Sister, we all know what happened to you yesterday morning. I expected that you would want to speak to me about it. But you could have come to my office. Your being here, in the confessional, implies that you, Sister, have done something wrong. You haven't. I assure you. I feared you might have misplaced feelings of guilt. If you condemn yourself because you
Father, if it was so trivial, so natural, so -- No. I have sinned. And you must listen if you are to prescribe an appropriate act of contrition, and to absolve me. Father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your arms to serve God?
It's funny, you knew. But the first thing I think of is kneading the bread that I help bake for the soup kitchen. Maybe that's because my the muscles in my arms still hurt.

I also thought of that bread, Father. And of that night six days ago when the Mother Superior died, and I kept the cool, damp cloth on her forehead freshly moist. Father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your legs to serve God?

Yes, Sister?
Yes, Sister?
Yesterday morning, God gave me but one chance to use something else to serve Him. Not my arms or my legs, but something I used for the first time, for the last time, and will never use again. My vagina.
Those boys, those sad, raging boys... They came to me as the needy do. And like many of the needy, they were rude. Like all the needy, they took. And like all the needy, they needed. Father. I knew them; They learn in our school. And play in our schoolyard. And they are good boys.
You knew them? Who were they, Sister? Who are these boys? What are the names of these -- good boys you knew?

Yo, check it. This is good and all that but one day soon I want to have much Benjamins so I can have a nice crib and pay all my bills. You hear me.

I'm tired of waiting.
We ran out without my shoes and the floor. I gotta get my stuff. What about our savings?
Are you crazy? The joint is crawling with cops now. You wanna go to Rikers? Go to the hoosegow?
We got evicted from our home. We've both been on the streets for the last week.
We was coming to see you.

If it's not too much trouble could you order us some food?

That ain't funny.
DeLa, I don't know 'bout this.
Manray, Sloan says you're too talented to be dancing on the street.
Well do something about it.
My tap shoes.
EUREKA!!
What do I have to do?
Some tap dancing, some singing.

Where do I sign?
How different?
Trust me. Of course I still have to pitch it to my boss, but we'll have an answer one way or the other.

That's right. Money turns the wheel.
I would like to change your name.
To what?
To what?
You're now Mantan.
You're now Mantan.
Mantan? I don't even care as long as I'm dancing. Which reminds me, I need some new kicks.
I want you to start using the name Mantan and not Manray if you don't mind.
Why?
Why?
You have to start getting into your character.
Mantan?
Mantan!!
I'm not playin' myself no mo'.
How you sound?

I won't do it anymore.
I won't do it anymore.
Manray, I'm very sorry about ya boy Cheeba and Sloan. Believe me, it gave me no joy pulling ya coattail about her, just lookin' out for a brother. I feel you, all this stuff happenin' at once but you can't let if affect your work. You gotta be professional.

No costume. No blackface.
Our guest today is Pierre Delacroix. He is the creator of the highly controversial TV show MANTAN. Let's get right into it. You have been called by some in the community a traitor, a sellout, an Uncle Tom. Why does your show generate such feelings?
Because race has always been a sensitive issue in this country. Gary, I have no problem with people disagreeing with the show, it's when folks start trying to mess with my inherent right as an artist, that's when I get mad. No one, in any way, shape or form should be censored.

No matter how sexist or racist the material may be?

Yes. And I say yes because who is to judge? Who is to stand before us and say this is righteous and this is not? Who? Who can play God?

Don't you people get it? We're in the 21st Century. Slavery was over four hundred years ago. All that stuff people talked in the old days, it's over. Folks always crying, white man this, white man that. Let's all grow up.

I didn't find out about this very important staff meeting until...
Four minutes ago.
So are you telling me everyone knew about this get-together except you?
So are you telling me everyone knew about this get-together except you?
I wasn't told about this until Marie informed me as soon as I got off the elevator.
Do you know what C.P. Time is?
C.P. Time is Colored People's Time. The stereotypical belief that Negroes are always late. That Negroes have no sense of time - time except when it comes to music or dance.
I'm sorry about my blowup but I have to have a whipping boy every meeting.
I understand. But again, in all honesty I was not informed.
I understand. But again, in all honesty I was not informed.
Forget it. I believe you're my most creative person I've got on staff. You're hip. You know what's happening. I got some corny white boys and girls writing for me.
I understand Black culture. I grew up around black people all my life. If the truth be told I probably know "niggers" better than you, Monsieur Delacroix. Please don't get offended by my use of the quote-unquote N word. I got a black wife and three bi-racial children, so I feel I have a right to use that word. I don't give a damn
I would prefer you not use that word in my presence.
I would prefer you not use that word in my presence.
NIGGER. NIGGER. NIGGER. NIGGER.
The material you've been creating is too white bread. White people with black faces. The Huxtable's, Cosby, revolutionary. But that's dead. We can't go down that road again.
I don't agree. The Negro middle class does exist, and it's rich material for a dramatic series or sitcom.
I don't agree. The Negro middle class does exist, and it's rich material for a dramatic series or sitcom.
I'm telling you it's not.
The middle class black family moves into a white suburban enclave. The middle class black family moves into a small Southern town that is run by the KKK. The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter. The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter. The middle class single black mother raises her teenage son. And so on and so forth.
...to white? I still feel all of my scripts would make good shows.
Delacroix, wake up, brother man. The reason why they didn't get picked up was because nobody - and I mean NOBODY - niggers and crackers alike wants to see that junk.
I've never been given a fair shot.
I've never been given a fair shot.
You got your head stuck up your ass with your Harvard education and your pretentious ways. Brother man, I'm blacker than you. I'm keepin' it real and you're frontin', trying to be white.

I'm an oreo, a sell out? Because I don't aspire to do HOMEBOYS FROM OUT OF SPACE, SECRET DIARY OF DESMOND PFEIFFER, A PJ's or some as you might put it, some "nigger" show? I'm a Tom? I'm whiter than white and you're blacker than black? Is that what you think?

That's exactly what I think. I want you to create something that people want to see. Let's be honest, the majority of the people in the country are deaf, dumb and blind and I'm including 35 million African-Americans. You know and I know "niggers" set the trend, set the styles.

I'm not sure if I can deliver what you want.
You will or you'll be back at BET so quick you'll never know what hit you. I need a mid-season replacement and pronto. It will be on the fast track.
What is it you want from me? Some plantation follies? Some sitcom that takes place on a watermelon patch? Some show that follows four nigger generations of junkies and crackheads? You want me to go back to the ante bellum days?
Yes! Yes! Yes! I want a show that will make headlines, that will have millions and millions of households tuned in, glued to their televisions every week. I want advertisers dying to buy on this show. I'm gonna squeeze this show out of you if it kills you.
Delacroix, I'm glad you got your mind right.
It's right and tight. Good morning, let me introduce you to everybody. You know my assistant, Sloan.
We're all happy to be here and I'm going to paint a picture for you.
I'm wid it.
I'm wid it.
I've done a lot of soul searching and once again you are right. In my previous work it's been all surface, superficial. I have never really dug deep. Not anymore. As Mark Twain fully understood satire is the way. Race has always been a hot button in this country's history and it needs to be pushed harder. If we are ever to live side

Go on. Good so far.
Go on. Good so far.
I know you're familiar with minstrel shows. They came about at the turn of the 19th century. It was a variety show in which the talent was in blackface - singing, dancing, telling jokes, doing skits. Dunwitty, I ask you when was the last time there was a good variety show on the air. Carol Burnett? HeeHaw?
Word!!!
So let's take this great form, this very American tradition of entertainment into the 21st century, into the new millennium.

I'm lovin' it. You know how I know? Because I'm getting a boner, my Johnson is hard, no disrespect my sister.
I'm feelin' dis'!
It will take a lot of courage and backbone on the part of the CNS to get this on the air. In fact, I would understand fully if the subject matter is deemed too risque, too controversial.

Don't worry about that, that's my department. Now who do we cast? We need a star. Can Whoopi sing or dance?

Are these our two stars, sitting here in front of my nose? Which one is Mantan again?
That's a great handle.
Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat. Two real coons. I know we're way out there but it's satire.
Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat. Two real coons. I know we're way out there but it's satire.
I want you take it there. All the way to the edge and back.
Every week we follow the trials and tribulations of two real coons - Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat. The Dusky Duo.
What are there character traits?

Ignorant, dullwitted, lazy, and unlucky.

Mantan is an uneducated Negro who always by some stroke of unbelievable stupidity makes his best laid plans go haywire.

Yep, you guessed it.

This could be bigger than "Amos and Andy."
Protest finally forced "Amos and Andy" off the air. Could stop us from ever getting on.
Let'em try. I will kill to make this happen.
Negroes would be in an uproar.
So what. We would just give the NAACP a donation that would be the end of that. No such thing as bad publicity. So what. Earlier you said singing and dancing.

Do we have characters? How about Honeycutt, Snowflake, Rastus, Nigger, Jim, Sambo, Jungle Bunny, and how could we forget Aunt Jemima.
We gonna hit 'em wid da BOMB DICKEY on dis' one. What's the setting?
In the projects. Like Eddie Murphy's "The PJ's."
In the projects. Like Eddie Murphy's "The PJ's."
Ya first bad move. Projects been done. That's one of the problems now, everything, movies, TV, are set in the urban jungle, da hood. That's so tired. Mantan's Millennium Minstrel Show should be set on a plantation. In Alabama.
And every week these Alabama porch monkeys will make us cry, make us laugh, make us look at our own humanity. Make us feel good to be alive.
I don't know about that plantation angle.
I don't know about that plantation angle.
What are you talkin' 'bout? It's the move. Stay wid me now. We're movin' fast. What does everybody else think about this?
That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout. That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout! He's off the hiz-hook!
We think so.
We think so.
Sleep 'n Eat, what do you do?
I strongly feel that a Negro should direct this. This kind of satire is a high wire act in a gale storm. One misstep and we're doing "Amos and Andy." Only a Negro will have the sensitivity and cultural awareness to navigate this dangerous terrain.
To hire someone solely on their ethnicity, gender or religion is not right. It's un-American. I will hire someone who is most qualified for this particular job.
I was hoping to perhaps direct some episodes myself, if not the pilot soon after.
I want a hot, young white director. Maybe the kid, that pheenom who just did that hot new sexy Madonna video.

Besides, what does he know about Negroes?

Probably nuthin', but that's why it's such a sexy way to go. Sometimes an outsider has a fresh new outlook, a different unique perspective. A black director, y'know what he's gonna do given the subject matter? With this kid, the possibilities are endless.

That's exactly my point. Has he even directed actors before in anything?
That's exactly my point. Has he even directed actors before in anything?
No!!! Just meet the guy. That's all I'm asking. Look, I'll even let you choose your own musical director. You can have that.
In the immortal words of Derrick Coleman, WHOOOPDEEDAMNDOO!!!
Derrick Coleman, he possessed all the talent in the world, coulda, shoulda, been a great ballplayer but alas D.C. didn't want it bad enough. Delacroix, do you want it? Bad enough to kill for it? Do you want it that much.
I'm gonna leave you two creative geniuses alone.
Dunwitty, don't leave.
I will not be held responsible for these revisions. These changes are not the way I want to go. This is an outrage. This is a sham. A violation!
Calm down, please.
I don't give a good goddamn about Finland, Norway, Sweden or wherever ya blond ass came from.
We just punched it up a bit. Made it funnier.
We just punched it up a bit. Made it funnier.
Funnier to who and at who's expense? Dunwitty, when Negroes start to run amok, the boycotts, when the demostrations commence, I'm giving them your home address. Let's see how you like it when they picket your lawn in Greenwich, Connecticut.

I seriously doubt that will ever happen. Didn't I tell you I know your people better than you do. But if by some miracle you're correct, I'm gonna invite them inside my house and we'll have a sit down, discuss it like civil human beings.
Yo, DeLa, I just got the news from the CNS brass. They saw some clips from the pilot and they're rushing it onto the air. Yo, we're a midseason replacement, ordered 12 shows. We're on in 3 weeks. Didya hear what I just said, Yo?
They didn't even view a rough cut, just some scenes we quickly cut together.

I did. I'm not an alcoholic. I just like to drink.
How did you end up here?
How did you end up here?
How did I end up at the third rate chittlin' circuit greasy hole in the wall in West Hell, Virginny? Is that what you're asking ya Daddy?
That's what I'm askin'.
Because I had too much pride. Too much integrity. I wouldn't lick nobody's butt. Some material I refused to do.
Because I had too much pride. Too much integrity. I wouldn't lick nobody's butt. Some material I refused to do.
Daddy, it can't be just because of that. There had to be other factors.
That's the only reason, period. They only want one certain kind of black comic.
Another one of your conspiracies to hold ya career back?

Let's get him over to the bed.
Baby, you treat me so good. Peerless, you're a good son, I love you. You never gave me no trouble.
I love you too, Daddy.
Always keep 'em laughing.
Glad to meet you, too. You are all your father talks about.
Is that so?
How long has my father been like this?
Not that often. He was excited to see you.

I was a hostess at this club, your Daddy was performing and I had never laughed so hard in my life. He asked me to come with him. I quit my job and we've been together ever since.
Don't tell him it's from me or he won't take it.
Your father is proud of you.
He never showed it.
He did the best way he knew how, Junebug is stubborn just like you.

Do you know how you will use him?

Not yet, but this thing will never get made.
You lost me.
Dunwitty wants a Coon show. And that's what I'm going to give him, it's going to be so racist, so negative, he won't have the balls to put it on the air. Hence I'll prove my point.

And lose out on my money? The only way I get paid is if I get fired. And that's what I intend to do.
Maybe something happened to them. Maybe they're lying in an alley bleed to death.
Manray better not be bleeding to death. I need him. After we're done he can do whatever he wants to do, until then, he's ours.
Hello.
This is Cheeba.
You okay?
I feel like somebody hit me upside da head with a sledgehammer.
What is your problem?

It was the principle. Dunwitty had to be enlightened. I was making a point. I take pride in my work. Plus, I already told you I wasn't gonna walk away from my money.
Fuck da money. Why do through all this effort? Why? Are you looking for love from Dunwitty? For respect? Dunwitty and his likes don't give a goddamn about you. So now what are you gonna do?
Even if money wasn't an issue, Dunwitty will still go ahead without me and that could be more dangerous.
What's the chances of MANTAN being picked up?

I wouldn't bet against it. My Negroidal ass is stuck between the proverbial rock and a hard place.
Like I said, all this for some twisted, distorted sense of principal. Dunwitty, he just tolerates your Negroidal ass, he doesn't respect it.
Good morning, for those of you who don't know me, I'm Pierre Delacroix. I'm running things and this here is my assistant Sloan Hopkins.
Hello.
Hello.
I've never worked with any of you and you've never worked with me so we'll be starting from scratch. I'm a fair person, a straight shooter and I don't hold my tongue. Everybody up in here should know I had nothing to do with you being hired.
This is the group I was telling you about.
Which one is your brother?
Which one is your brother?
The big one.
You've said that already.
I'm gonna slit my wrists. Cut my throat. For the love of Joseph.
Just want to say good luck.
Break a leg.
Your life will never be the same.
Let's leave the man in peace so he can get ready.

We both lied to him.

What do you want me to say?
What do you want me to say?
Just don't lie to me.
Same here.
The pleasure is mine.
I want to apologize about my brother and the Mau-Mau's. I should not have imposed them on you.
C'mon. You were only doing what family is supposed to be doing for family. You gave your brother a shot. That's all anybody can ask for, an opportunity, a chance, a shot. He got his.
Who's side are you on?
I'm sorry, I can't help it. It's too funny.
What would their reaction be? I hadn't the foggiest.
Everybody shut up.
So you have your small victory, now what?
A small victory isn't that small when you've been use to losing.
What is this?
A gift.
A gift.
For what?
For what?
No matter what you think, you did come up with something unique. Open it.
The Jolly Nigger Bank.
This is authentic, not a repro, circa turn of the century.

To me, it shows part of our history in this country, a time when we were considered inferior, sub-human.
Why'd you do that?
I don't want to hear it.

Do you have to be so damn forthright?
DeLa, you should try it sometime. Come into the light.
Light?
Light?

You can talk all that mumbo jumbo if you want to but your hands are much bloody. I know where I made my big mistake. I have a general rule, never get involved romantically with somebody crazier than you.
This is crazy.
That's why it will be so much fun.
That was a mistake, but I don't regret it.
The first and only time. A big mistake. I'm gonna have to ask you not to see Mantan anymore.

Work related or otherwise?
Otherwise. I trust you know the difference. You're an intelligent woman, finished at NYU.
DeLa, kiss my big black ass.
DeLa, kiss my big black ass.
And that's how you got me in the first place.
Don't make me have to use this.
I didn't think this was in your studies at NYU.
I told you but you wouldn't listen. You never listened to me.
Give me the gun.
Yes, your name?
He, I'm Mona.
He, I'm Mona.
Hi, Mona.
Hi, Mona.
I perfectly understand where you're coming from. As a minority I can relate to your struggle also. But I think you should give us all a chance. We want this pilot to be successful just as much as you. Please don't be so quick to judge us based only on our whiteness.

Oh, is that what I'm doing?
This thing was rigged, the deck was stacked, the fix was in. Could Don King be near? Good thing Sloan had my back. She's my rock. This was going to be a whole lot of work.
David, I appreciate your comments. Anybody got an ideas? Everybody just talk out loud.

I've always liked the format of Rowan and Martin's "LAUGH-IN."
I'm happy for all of us. It's just we have a great responsibility now. The pressure is on.
Pressure? DeLa, you don't know what the hell real pressure is. SHEEETT!!! This is lightstuff. Now when you scramblin' out on the street in da January winter and the hawk is talkin' to you with NO money and NO prospects of money anytime soon, now that there is some pressure.

I didn't mean it to sound like that.
That's the way it came out. Let me ask you one question. Have you ever been in want, in need your entire privileged life?
Now I'm privileged?! Why? Because I didn't grow up on food stamps and welfare? Because I didn't call home a cardboard box? No, I never ever went to bed hungry and I'm proud of it, too. Whoever told you that living in poverty earns you somekind of badge of honor flat out lied to you.

The point I'm trying to make is that this is a blessing. It's going to be fun doing this show and we should all look at it that way.
Can I kiss you too?
Naw. I'll take the zero.

No.
No.

Yo, DeLa, they tried to lynch my black ass up in dat piece.
You've made it from the guttermost to the uppermost. Don't you know you should never let them see you sweat. Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?
Yeah.
Yeah.
And now is definitely not the time to bitch up.
You shouldn't even be mad at me over Sloan.
What you did is dead wrong.

Can't beat it with a hammer. Well, since you asked, it looks like I may have a new show, a pilot being shot.

Peerless, last time, go see your father.
I'm doing okay. Been reading about your show, it's all over everywhere. I watched it's all over everywhere. I watched it once. I thought you said there would be no buffoonery.
You going to attack me too. The show is a hit. Aren't you happy for me?

This is a travesty. A debacle.
Good luck, Jukka. Do a good show.
Thank you very much. I always try my best.
I know all of you have seen the overnight ratings. Through the roof. But in this game you gotta be one, two, three steps ahead. I introduce you to Myrna Goldfarb. She's the best media consultant in the biz.
First, I would like to say I love the show. It's very courageous. My parents marched in Selma, Alabama with Dr. King.
Myrna is here to help us plan our strategy.
The best defense is offense.
The Mantan Manifesto. Catchy ain't it? Number One. We gainfully employ African Americans, in front of and behind the cameras. Two. Let the audience decide. Three. Who put these critics in charge? These so-called cultural police? Four. Who determines what is black? Five. Mantan is a satire. Six. If they can't take a joke, "F" 'em.
We all stick to this, it's smooth sailing.
Let Myrna finish.
Thank you. And always smile.
Yes you!
This show was created, conceived by you, a non-threatening African- American male. Voila. End of argument. It can't be racist because you're black.
I never had a really real pair before.

Yo, Tavis, check it out. This is the two-one, the 21st century and it's all about the money. Like my man Mase says, "it's all about the Benjamins."
Money and nothing else?
Money makes the world go round. It ain't no joke being poor. I know whatI'mtalkin''bout. Y'knowwhatI'msayin'? I've lived on the street. I've been homeless. I've learned how to play the game, work the game, be in the game.

Is it inevitable that the game plays you?
No if you go with the flow, Tavis. That's what a lot of Negroes don't understand. Protesting isn't gonna do a damn thing. If people don't like our satire in our number one hit show then don't watch it. Or better yet write your own show. Do it better.

Years ago I married a widow who had a grown-up daughter. My daddy visited us often, fell in love with my stepdaughter and married her.

Why all of a sudden are you flippin' on me? This blackface thing was part of the deal from the git-go. Don't even try to play it like you ain't a part of all this. You down with Delacroix.

Is your mother not afraid on account of the highwayman to let one so young as you travel?
Is your mother not afraid on account of the highwayman to let one so young as you travel?
Not at all, sir. I have a pair of good pistols that have already done execution, and are ready to do it again.
And, I'll tell you what, Mr. Dugan, I've been insulted grossly in this house. I ain't at all satisfied with these here ways of going on. I'm an Englishman, I am, and a man of property; and I -- I --
If you're insulted, and not satisfied, remember there's two of us, Best.
Both of us ride home with Best here.
I'm not afraid of highwaymen. My man is armed, and so am I.
I'm not afraid of highwaymen. My man is armed, and so am I.
You know the use of arms very well, Best, and no one can doubt your courage; but Michael and I will see you home for all that.
There's nothing else for it. Take your ground, Grogan -- twelve paces, I suppose?
Ten, sir, and make them short ones, do you hear, Captain Grogan?
Ten, sir, and make them short ones, do you hear, Captain Grogan?
Don't bully, Mr. Best. Here are the pistols. God bless you, my boy; and when I count three, fire.
Hoity-toity! John Best, what's the matter here?
I'll tell you what it is, Mr. Dugan. I have had enough of Miss Dugan here and your Irish ways. I ain't used to 'em, sir.
I'll tell you what it is, Mr. Dugan. I have had enough of Miss Dugan here and your Irish ways. I ain't used to 'em, sir.
Well, well! What is it? We'll make you used to our ways, or adopt English ones.
Well, well! What is it? We'll make you used to our ways, or adopt English ones.
It's not the English way, for ladies to have two lovers, and, so, Mr. Dugan, I'll thank you to pay me the sum you owe me, and I resign all claims to this young lady. If she has a fancy for school-boys, let her take 'em, sir.

Pooh! Pooh! Best, you are joking.
Pooh! Pooh! Best, you are joking.
I never was more in earnest.
My companion treated me with great civility, and asked me a thousand questions about England, which I answered as best I might. But this best, I am bound to say, was bad enough. I knew nothing about England, and I invented a thousand stories which I told him; described the king and the ministers to him, said the British ambassador in Berlin was my
What is your uncle's name?
What is your uncle's name?
O'Grady.
O'Grady.
Oh, yes, of course, Ambassador O'Grady...
This is a very good inn. Shall we stop for dinner?
This may be a very good inn for Germany, but it would not pass in old Ireland. Corbach is only a league off, let us push on for Corbach.

Ah! You sly rogue, I see that will influence you.
The place seems more a farm than an inn-yard.

The people are great farmers, as well as inn-keepers.
Where's the beauty you promised me?
It was my joke. I was tired, and did not care to go farther. There's not prettier woman here than that. If she won't suit your fancy, my friend, then you must wait awhile.
Upon my word, sir, I think you have acted very coolly.
I have acted as I think fit.
I have acted as I think fit.
Sir, I'm a British officer.

It's a lie! You're a deserter! You're an impostor, sir; Your lies and folly have confirmed this to me. You pretend to carry dispatches to a general who has been dead these ten months; you have an uncle who is an ambassador and whose name you don't know. Will you join and take the bounty, sir, or will you be given up?

Good morning, Private James. Please come in. I should like you to meet my uncle, Herr Minister of Police Galgenstein.
How do you do, sir?
The captain was the nephew and heir of the Minister of Police, Herr Galgenstein, a relationship which, no doubt, aided in the younger gentlemen's promotion.
Your loyalty to me and your service to the regiment has pleased me very well -- and now there is another occasion on which you may make yourself useful to us; if you succeed, depend on it, your reward will be your discharge from the army, and a bounty of 100 guineas.

What is the service, sir?
What is the service, sir?
There is lately come to Berlin a gentleman in the service of the Empress Queen, who calls himself the Chevalier de Belle Fast, and wears the red riband and star of the pope's order of the Spur. He is made for good society, polished, obliging, a libertine, without prejudices, fond of women, of good food, of high play, prudent and discreet.
You are a Hungarian; you served in the army, and left on account of weakness in the loins. He gambles a great deal, and wins. Do you know the cards well?
Only a very little, as soldiers do.
Only a very little, as soldiers do.
I had thought you more expert. You must find out if the Chevalier cheats. He sees the English and Austrian envoys continually, and the young men of either ministry sup repeatedly at his house. Find out what they talk of, for how much each plays, especially if any of them play on parole. If you are able to, read his private letters, though about
What are the Chevalier's intentions?
I am not sure. The Prince told him quite clearly that if he wished to have the money, he would have to fight for it.
Has he sent the challenge yet?
Not yet, but I believe he intends to.
You say he drives after breakfast and before dinner. When he comes out to his carriage a couple of gendarmes will mount the box, and the coachman will get his orders to move on.
And his baggage?
And his baggage?
Oh! That will be sent after him. I have a fancy to look into that red box which contains his papers, you say; and at noon, after parade, shall be at the inn. You will not say a word to any one there regarding the affair, and will wait for me at the Chevalier's rooms until my arrival. We must force that box. You
This is a pretty way to recommend yourself to the family.
The man that marries Dorothy Dugan must first kill me -- do you mind that?
Dorothy might love me or not, as she likes, but Best will have to fight me before he marries her!
Faith, I think you are a lad that's likely to keep your word.
A pretty day's work of it you have made, Master Roderick. Knowing your uncle to be distressed for money, and try and break off a match which will bring fifteen hundred a-year into the family? Best has promised to pay off the four thousand pounds which is bothering your uncle so. He takes a girl without a penny -- a girl that has been
And so I am.
And so I am.
And this is the return you make for his kindness! Didn't he harbor you in his house when your father died, and hasn't he given you and your mother, rent-free, your fine house of Jamesville yonder?
And this is the return you make for his kindness! Didn't he harbor you in his house when your father died, and hasn't he given you and your mother, rent-free, your fine house of Jamesville yonder?
Mark this, come what will of it, I swear I will fight the man who pretends to the hand of Dorothy Dugan. I'll follow him if it's into the church, and meet him there. I'll have his blood, or he shall have mine. Will you take my message to him, and arrange the meeting?

Well, if it must be, it must. For a young fellow, you are the most bloodthirsty I ever saw. No officer, bearing His Majesty's commission, can receive a glass of wine on his nose, without resenting it -- fight you must, and Best is a huge, strong fellow.

In faith, I believe you are not; for a lad I never saw more game in my life. Give me a kiss, my dear boy. You're after my own soul. As long as Jack Grogan lives, you shall never want a friend or a second.
Have you taken my message to him?
The meeting is arranged. Captain Best is waiting for you now.

Your cousins go out with him.
That's a very handsome sword you have there.
It was with this sword that my late father, Harry James, God rest his soul, met Sir Huddelstone Fuddelstone, the Hampshire baronet, and was fatally run through the neck. He was quite in the wrong, having insulted Lady Fuddelstone, when in liquor, at the Brentford Assembly. But, like a gentleman, he scorned to apologize.

Look here, Roderick, my boy; this is silly business. The girl will marry Best, mark my words; and as sure as she does, you'll forget her. You are but a boy. Best is willing to consider you as such. Dublin's a fine place, and if you have a mind to take a ride thither and see the town for a month, here are twenty
A man of honor dies, but never apologizes. I'll see the captain hanged before I apologize.
Grogan gave me a wink of recognition, but offered no public token of acquaintance and it was not until two days afterwards that he called me into his quarters, and then, shaking hands with me cordially, gave me news which I wanted, of my family.
I had news of you in Dublin. Faith, you've begun early, like your father's son, but I think you could not do better than as you have done. But why did you not write home to your poor mother? She has sent half-a-dozen letters to you in Dublin.

I suppose she addressed them to me in my real name, by which I never thought to ask for them at the post office.

No, the very same one, my boy. He recovered from his wound. The ball you hit him with was not likely to hurt him. It was only made of tow.

He has paid off your uncle's mortgage. He gave Dorothy a coach- and-six. That coward of a fellow has been making of your uncle's family. Faith, the business was well done. Your cousins, Michael and Harry, never let him out of their sight, though he was for deserting to England, until the marriage was completed, and the happy couple off on their road to

And I think he was as much affected as I was at thus finding one of his kindred; for he, too, was an exile from home, and a friendly voice, a look, brought the old country back to his memory again, and the old days of his boyhood.
I'd give five years of my life to see the old country again, the greenfields, and the river, and the old round tower, and the burying place.
The cards are now my only livelihood. Sometimes I am in luck, and then I lay out my money in these trinkets you see. It's property, look you, and the only way I have found of keeping a little about me. When the luck goes against me, why, my dear, my diamonds go to the pawnbrokers and I wear paste.

But how, sir?
Gentlemen, I wish you a good day. Will you please go to the house from whence we set out this morning, and tell my man there to send my baggage on to Three Kings at Dresden?
Then ordering fresh horses, the Chevalier set off on his journey for that capital. I need not tell you that I was the Chevalier.
When the Duke of Courland brought fourteen lackeys each with bags of florins, and challenged our bank to play against the sealed bags, what did we ask?
Sir, we have but eighty thousand florins in bank, or two hundred thousand at three months; if your highness' bags do not contain more than eight thousand, we will meet you.

I saw that my imaginings had stood me in better stead. And so we became only friends, seldom sleeping together and arousing no curiosity in
O, my dearest love. Enough! I beg you. Stop believing in your experience. You have never known love. My very soul is leaving me! Catch it on your lips, and give me yours!
Without you, my dearest, I might have died without ever knowing love. Inexpressible love! God of nature! Bitterness than which nothing is sweeter, sweetness than which nothing is more bitter. Divine monster which can only be defined by paradoxes.

As soon as I saw you loved me, I was pleased, and I gave you every opportunity to fall more in love with me, being certain that, for my part, I would never love you. But after our first kiss, I found that I had no power over myself. I did not know that one kiss could matter so much.

My Lady Cosgrove's relationship with me was a singular one. Her life was passed in a series of crack-brained sort of alternation between love and hatred for me. We would quarrel for a fortnight, then we should be friends for a month together sometimes. One day, I was joking her, and asking her whether she would take the water again, whether she had found
Roderick, you know well enough that I have never loved but you! Was I ever so wretched that a kind word from you did not make me happy? Ever so angry, but the least offer of good-will on your part did not bring me to your side? Did I not give a sufficient proof of my affection for you in bestowing one of the
Lady Cosgrove, you are an old fool.
Old fool!
I accept, but I insist on a wager. The loser must do whatever the winner pleases.
Agreed.
Agreed.
Do you see the gate at the end of the field? The first to touch it will be the winner.
I feel the ribbon.
Then you must get it.
Why are you shaking?
With pleasure at finding the ribbon.
I hate Miss Clancy, you know I do! And I only danced with her because -- because -- the person with whom I intended to dance chose to be engaged the whole night.
I had not been in the room five minutes before I was engaged for every single set.

Were you obliged to dance five times with Captain Best, and then stroll out with him into the garden?
Were you obliged to dance five times with Captain Best, and then stroll out with him into the garden?
I don't care a fig for Captain Best; he dances prettily to be sure, and is a pleasant rattle of a man. He looks well in his regimentals, too; and if he chose to ask me to dance, how could I refuse him?

But you refused me, Dorothy.
But you refused me, Dorothy.
Oh! I can dance with you any day, and to dance with your own cousin at a ball as if you could find no other partner. Besides, Roderick, Captain Best's a man, and you are only a boy, and you haven't a guinea in the world.

If ever I meet him again, you shall see which is the best man of the two. I'll fight him with sword or with pistol, captain as he is.
If ever I meet him again, you shall see which is the best man of the two. I'll fight him with sword or with pistol, captain as he is.
But Captain Best is already known as a valiant soldier, and is famous as a man of fashion in London. It is mighty well of you to fight farmers' boys, but to fight an Englishman is a very different matter.
Suppose, now, Roderick, you, who are such a hero, was passing over the bridge and the enemy on the other side.
I'd draw my sword, and cut my way through them.
I'd draw my sword, and cut my way through them.
What, with me on the pillion? Would you kill poor me?
What, with me on the pillion? Would you kill poor me?
Well, then, I'll tell you what I'd do. I'd jump Daisy into the river, and swim you both across, where no enemy could follow us.
Well, then, I'll tell you what I'd do. I'd jump Daisy into the river, and swim you both across, where no enemy could follow us.
Jump twenty feet! You wouldn't dare to do any such thing on Daisy. There's the captain's horse, Black George, I've heard say that Captain Bes --
Monster! Your father was a tailor, and you are always thinking of the shop. But I'll have my revenge, I will! Roddy, will you see me insulted?
Indeed, Miss Dorothy, I intend to have his blood as sure as my name's Roderick.
I am at your service, Mr. Cosgrove. How much do you wish to spend?
As much as possible.
As much as possible.
As much as possible?
As much as possible?
Yes, for I wish to entertain splendidly.
Yes, for I wish to entertain splendidly.
All the same, you must name an amount.
All the same, you must name an amount.
It is entirely up to you. I want the best.
Last month, the Duke of Suffolk spent no more.
All right, five hundred guineas.
And, to be sure, I did know someone who knew precisely how these things were done, and this was the distinguished solicitor and former Government Minister, Lord West, whose acquaintance I made, as I had so many others, at the gaming table.
Do you happen to know Gustavus Adolphus, the thirteenth Earl of Crabs?
Do you happen to know Gustavus Adolphus, the thirteenth Earl of Crabs?
By name only.
By name only.
Well, sir, this nobleman is one of the gentlemen of His Majesty's closet, and one with whom our revered monarch is on terms of considerable intimacy. I should say you would be wise to fix upon this nobleman your chief reliance for the advancement of your claim to the Viscounty which you propose to get.
Have you done, Mr. Cosgrove?
Yes!
Yes!
Well, Mr. Cosgrove, I'll answer you point by point. The King is exceedingly averse to make peers, as you know. Your claim, as you call them, have been laid before him, and His Majesty's gracious reply was, that you were the most impudent man in his dominions, and merited a halter, rather than a coronet. As for withdrawing your support from us, you are
Does this assignment interest you?
Yes, Minister, I am interested in any work in which I can be of service to Captain Galgenstein.
Was he cheated?
In so far as I can tell these things -- no. I believe the Chevalier won the money fairly.
In so far as I can tell these things -- no. I believe the Chevalier won the money fairly.
Hmm-mmmm.
A meeting with the Prince of Turbingen is impossible.
The Prince left him only that choice.
The King has determined to send the Chevalier out of the country.
When is he to go?
Then this must be done tomorrow.
What is to be done?
What has happened, madam, to annoy your ladyship?
Oh, I am grateful to you, sir. I am the wife of Captain O'Reilly hastening to join him at Dublin. My chair was stopped by a highwayman; this great oaf of a servant-man fell down on his knees, armed as he was, and though there were thirty people in the next field, working, when the ruffian attacked, not one of them would help but,
Be off to your work, you pack of rascals, or you will have a good taste of my thong. Have you lost much?
Everything -- my purse, containing upwards of a hundred guineas, my jewels, my snuff-boxes, watches. And all because this blundering coward fell to his knees...
That fool didn't know what was the meaning of a hundred-pound bill, which was in the pocket-book that the fellow took from me.
I am riding to Dublin myself, and if your ladyship will allow me the honor of riding with you, I shall do my best to protect you from further mishap.
I am riding to Dublin myself, and if your ladyship will allow me the honor of riding with you, I shall do my best to protect you from further mishap.
But I shouldn't like to put you to such trouble, Mister...?
But I shouldn't like to put you to such trouble, Mister...?
O'Higgins... Mohawk O'Higgins.
As you have been robbed of your purse, may I have permission to lend your ladyship a couple of pieces to pay any expenses which you might incur before reaching your home?
That's very kind of you, Mr. O'Higgins.
How different was her lively rattle to the vulgar wenches at Kilwangan assemblies. In every sentence, she mentioned a lord or a person of quality. To the lady's question about my birth and parentage, I replied that I was a young gentleman of large fortune, that I was going to Dublin for my studies, and that my mother allowed me five hundred per annum.
You must be very cautious with regard to the company you should meet in Dublin, where rogues and adventurers of all countries abound. I hope you will do me the honor of accepting lodgings in my own house, where Captain O'Reilly will welcome with delight, my gallant young preserver.
I have good news for you, Mr. Cosgrove. The firm of Bracegirdle and Chatwick, in the city of London, are prepared to lend you 20,000 pounds, pledged against your interest in the Edric mines. They will redeem the encumbrances against the property, which amount to some 10,000 pounds, and take a twenty- year working lease on the mines. They will lend you the 20,000
Mr. Newcombe, I have made some difficult loans during the past few years, at very onerous terms, but 18% a year interest seems very stiff indeed.
Mr. Newcombe, I have made some difficult loans during the past few years, at very onerous terms, but 18% a year interest seems very stiff indeed.
Considering your financial circumstances, Mr. Cosgrove, it has been impossible to find anyone at all prepared to do any business with you. I think you may count yourself lucky to have this opportunity. But, obviously, if you would reject this offer, I shall keep trying to find a better one.

I am prepared to accept the terms, Mr. Newcombe.
There are a few other points we should discuss. The loan agreement can only be executed by her ladyship's signature, and provided that Bracegirdle and Chatwick can be assured of her ladyship's freewill in giving her signature.

Yes, of course.
Yes, of course.
Mister Bracegirdle said to me that he had heard her ladyship lives in some fear of her life, and meditated a separation, in which case, she might later repudiate any documents signed by herself while in durance, and subject them, at any rate, to a doubtful and expensive litigation. They were quite insistent on this point, and said they must have absolute assurance of

I see.
When I asked them in what form they would accept her ladyship's assurances, they said that they were only prepared to accept them if her ladyship confirms her written consent by word of mouth, in their presence, at their counting-house in Birchin Lane, London. I requested they come here, and save her ladyship and yourself the inconvenience of the trip to London, but they
Did you buy the horse, papa?
Now, just have a little patience, my boy. Your birthday isn't until next week.

But I will have it on my birthday, won't I?

Well, we'll just have to wait and see, won't we?
Good night, papa.
Good night, my little darling.
Good night, my little darling.
Papa?
Papa?
Yes?
Yes?
One of the boys in the stable told Nelly that you've already bought my horse, and that it's at Doolan's farm, where Mick the groom is breaking it in. Is that true, papa?

What the devil? What kind of fools do we have here? Pottle, who told the lad this story?
I promise your lordship a good flogging if you even so much as go to Doolan's farm to see him.
Yes, papa.
Your bother is in America fighting the rebels.
Is he all right, papa?
Is he all right, papa?
Yes, he's fine.
Yes, he's fine.
Brooksy was better than you, papa, he used not to swear so, and he taught me many good things while you were away.
I made Sir William Cosgrove's acquaintance as usual at the play- table. One could not but admire the spirit and gallantry with which he pursued his favorite pastime; for, though worn out with gout and a myriad of diseases, a cripple wheeled about in a chair, and suffering pangs of agony, yet you would see him every morning, and every evening at his post
Hang it, Mr. Roderick James, you have no more manners than a barber, and I think my black footman has been better educated than you; but you are a young fellow of originality and pluck, and I like you, sir. because you seem determined to go to the devil by a way of your own.
Indeed, you are right, sir. Look at me. Marriage has added forty years to my life. I am dying, a worn-out cripple, at the age of fifty. When I took off Lady Cosgrove, there was no man of my years who looked so young as myself. Fool that I was! I had enough with my pensions, perfect freedom, the best society in Europe --
Would you have me spend my life all alone?
Would you have me spend my life all alone?
In truth, sir, yes, but, if you must marry, then marry a virtuous drudge.

The milkmaid's daughter?
The milkmaid's daughter?
Well, why not a milkmaid's daughter? No man of sense need restrict himself or deny himself a single amusement for his wife's sake; on the contrary, if he selects the animal properly, he will choose such a one as shall be no bar to his pleasure, but a comfort in his hours of annoyance. For instance, I have got the gout; who tends me?
Sir William Cosgrove, with his complication of ills, was dying before us by inches. He was continually tinkered up by doctors, and, what with my usual luck, he might be restored to health and live I don't know how many years. If Cosgrove would not die, where was the use of my pursing his lady? But my fears were to prove groundless, for on
Good evening, Mr. James, have you done with my lady?
Good evening, Mr. James, have you done with my lady?
I beg your pardon?
I beg your pardon?
Come, come, sir. I am a man who would rather be known as a cuckold than a fool.
Come, come, sir. I am a man who would rather be known as a cuckold than a fool.
I think, Sir William Cosgrove, you have had too much drink. Your chaplin, Mr. Hunt, has introduced me into the company of your lady to advise me on a religious matter, of which she is a considerable expert.
Gentlemen, see this amiable youth! He has been troubled by religious scruples, and has flown for refuge to my chaplin, Mr. Hunt, who has asked for advise from my wife, Lady Cosgrove, and between them both, they are confirming my ingenious young friend in his faith. Did you ever hear of such doctors and such a disciple?
Faith, sir, if I want to learn good principles, it's surely better I should apply for them to your lady, and your chaplin than to you?
Faith, sir, if I want to learn good principles, it's surely better I should apply for them to your lady, and your chaplin than to you?
He wants to step into my shoes! He wants to step into my shoes!
Well, if my intentions are what you think they are -- if I do wish to step into your shoes, what then? I have no other intentions than you had yourself. Lady Cosgrove's wealth may be great, but am I not of a generous nature enough to use it worthily? Her rank is lofty, but not so lofty as my ambition. I will be
Is it not a pleasure, gentlemen, for me, as I am drawing near the goal, to find my home such a happy one; my wife so fond of me, that she is even now thinking of appointing a successor? Isn't it a comfort to see her; like a prudent housewife, getting everything ready for her husband's departure?

I hope that you are not thinking of leaving us soon, knight?
I hope that you are not thinking of leaving us soon, knight?
Not so soon, my dear, as you may fancy perhaps. Why, man, I have been given over many times these four years, and there was always a candidate or two waiting to apply for the situation. Who knows how long I may keep you waiting.

Sir, let those laugh that win.
Sir, let those laugh that win.
I am sorry for you Mr. James. I'm grieved to keep you or any gentleman waiting. Had you not better to arrange with my doctor or get the cook to flavor my omelette with arsenic? What are the odds, gentlemen, that I don't live to see Mr. James hang yet?

Don't you mean "don't need no liquor license not taken away from me"?
Hurricane kept you up, too?
Yeah, and I could've used the sleep. I'm supposed to meet people here tonight, try and get some work going.
Bill Styles...
Who?
Who?
Old friend. Haven't talked to him in -- 911. Can I use your phone?
Don't you ever point a gun at me!
I'm -- I'm sorry...
A target, Kendall, cap a fucking target. What's wrong with you?
I thought I was gonna have an attack. Go into a fit and bite off my own tongue in the middle of the bayou. Childs could tell I wasn't right.
I thought I was gonna have an attack. Go into a fit and bite off my own tongue in the middle of the bayou. Childs could tell I wasn't right.
Just safety your shit and get behind me, okay? I'll take care of this.
Fuck, what the fuck is going on --
What do we do?
What do we do?
Whoever it is isn't shooting at us...
I don't want to go --
Fine.
Did -- did you --
It was the grenade you fucking idiot. Look at him!
What about Pike?
Maybe he'll be there. Either way, we have to go.
He is the only one unaccounted for.
Maybe he's dead too. Maybe you killed them both, Mueller --
You framed-him...
None of that matters now. We got two dead bodies and a story that explains them. You're either with us, or against us -- which is it?
This isn't our area. Whose area is this --
Can anybody hear me!
Hey, I -- Holy fuck... holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do?
We found him like this --
You killed him you fucking faggot --
We found him like this! Kendall was with me the whole -- Listen to me!
We got -- I don't know, we got separated
Before or after the explosion? Mueller --
Before or after the explosion? Mueller --
I don't know!
Shut the fuck up, you fucking faggot, You just shut the FUCK UP.
HEY!
West was one thing, but this --
Shut up, Mueller.
We finished the course and came here, then heard an explosion -- Where's Pike?
We don't know. West is dead.
What about you, wandering around alone? At least we have an alibi --
What do you mean, alone?
Holy fuck... Holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do?
We found him like this...
Yeah, right...
Shut up. West's dead.
You too?
We can still come out of this okay. Pike got free, he got a gun, he came after us. That's the story.
Why not?
I asked for a policeman.
I asked for a policeman.
You're under military arrest, it's not gonna happen. What's wrong with baseball?

Well, it's a game of anticipation, that's the beauty.
Well, it's a game of anticipation, that's the beauty.
I just don't like it.
I just don't like it.
What do you like then?
I don't know... I like the Army.
C'mon, Ray, everyone hates the Army during Basic. I'll tell you straight, I hated it here.
C'mon, Ray, everyone hates the Army during Basic. I'll tell you straight, I hated it here.
You did Basic here?
You did Basic here?
Fifteen years ago under Sergeant West. Piece of work, that guy. I remember, he used to have these two silver .45's with ivory handles and if you weren't quick enough, he'd knock you on the head with one of them. He still carry those guns?
There's no need...
They're dead, aren't they?
Right. Now, I'm gonna go get you another donut and you think about whether you want to talk more, okay?
Okay.
Why'd you ask for a cop, Ray?
I'm not telling you what happened.
I'm not telling you what happened.
Okay... but I would like to know about the other cadets. What they were like -- nice guys?
Some.
Tell me about them.
And those were the guys who went on the exercise with you?
Yeah. And that's all I'm saying.
You smoke, Ray?
This is one of those interrogation tricks, isn't it? You don't give me a cigarette till I tell you more.
This is one of those interrogation tricks, isn't it? You don't give me a cigarette till I tell you more.
No, actually, I just left mine in the car and was hoping you had some.
Hey, Ray! Just had a nice talk with your buddy Kendall -- seems you killed three people!
That son of a bitch.
That son of a bitch.
That'd be my reaction too --
That'd be my reaction too --
He's lying.
He's lying.
Well, why didn't you say so? We'll just drop all your charges, then --
Well, why didn't you say so? We'll just drop all your charges, then --
I'm serious --
Fuck "you're serious", Raymond, you got exactly zero truck with us; right now we'd take the word of a crackhead over yours, so if you've got something to say, say it.
Did Kendall tell you about the PX?
So Childs made some side money, so what? People are dead, Ray, and the only one we have to blame is you --
I didn't shoot West --
I didn't shoot West --
Yeah, we know, Pike did.
I apologize --
You saw West's body.
You saw West's body.
Of course --
And he'd been shot.
Yeah --
You shot Childs and Nunez.
They would have killed us both. You want me to write a confession, I'll write a confession.
They would have killed us both. You want me to write a confession, I'll write a confession.
You saved Kendall's life --
You saved Kendall's life --
But not Pike's.
Raymond, for you to have any chance of coming out of this, we need to locate the other bodies and examine them to corroborate your testimony. Otherwise this is just another story --
Mr. Hardy, I joined the army for college money. I didn't ask for any of this -- I tried to do the right thing out there and people got killed. You say finding those bodies'll help me, then go find them. I don't want to die.
We're not finished yet --
You wanna bet?
We don't need the tapes --
Oh, you don't? What else do you have on me? You haven't found any bodies yet, have you?
Oh, you don't? What else do you have on me? You haven't found any bodies yet, have you?
We've found all of them.
Not true, Cadet, I've got a gun --
Jesus!
He -- He made me do it --
Do what?
Do what?
Hunting -- we had to hunt him --
I guess Nunez wasn't dead after all. He came after us with a vengeance. You know the rest.
And the bodies?
And the bodies?
You won't find them. Won't find West, either. He's too good.
I promised them I'd ask you where West and the others are...
Washout rejects, guys he said were "dumbfucks too stupid to know they dead"...
Washout rejects, guys he said were "dumbfucks too stupid to know they dead"...
He's telling the truth up to a point...
Are you saying Sergeant West tried to kill you?
No, ma'am, he just wanted us to quit. Making it through was kind of an honor. Some of the other guys on the base told us that if you could hack Section Eight, Command would consider you at the top of the class.
That first night with Pike. I made the mistake of letting him sit down at around 0300.
Tell us about the other guys, the ones West weeded out.
Tell us about the other guys, the ones West weeded out.
There were six of us...
He was sickly. Had that shaking thing, whatd'yacall it, epoxy?
Epilepsy.
Epilepsy.
Yeah. Spent half his time in the infirmary. Only reason he enlisted was his father. West didn't section him till last week.
He said he worked there --
No, did he tell you about it? About the business Childs ran?
No, did he tell you about it? About the business Childs ran?
What business?
What business?
Pills, shots, you name it, Basic's a lot easier when you don't feel pain --
Where?
The creek bed --
What about the phosphorous grenade?
One went off, yeah, but it didn't touch him -- I thought you knew this --
Back up.
Mueller was alone in the cabin?
Mueller was alone in the cabin?
Yeah.
Why didn't you tell us all this in the first place?
Would you have believed me?
Where's the cabin?
Don't know on a map. West told us it was there, we just found it. Maybe the hurricane took it away.
You kept Kendall alive to corroborate your story and he did it all they way up to the end. You even gave him his own motive in case we decided to burn him, too.
Can't do that now, though, can you?
Is that what I did, now? And of course, you can prove all of it.
We can prove that you're not Ray Dunbar. Impersonating a fellow Cadet is a court-martial in and of itself --
We can prove that you're not Ray Dunbar. Impersonating a fellow Cadet is a court-martial in and of itself --
Did I ever claim I was Raymond Dunbar? Was I ever told to state my name rank and serial number for the record? No. You assumed who I was, because I was wearing this uniform. Don't believe me?
Ohhhh, I don't think so...
How do you know that?
How do you know that?
Just a guess. Maybe they're not where they're supposed to be. Maybe somebody moved them. Habeas Corpus -- no bodies, no crime, and Nunez still plays as self defense. Face it detectives... you have nothing.
Cadet, what's your name!
Sir, Dunbar, sir!
Sir, Dunbar, sir!
You know how to work a pistol, Dunbar?
You know how to work a pistol, Dunbar?
Sir, yes, sir!
Dunbar you are to stand here and guard this nigger for the next twenty- four hours! He is not to be given food, water, or clothes! If he so much as moves, you are to blow his nigger brains out, is that clear?
Sir, yes, sir!
Sir, yes, sir!
The rest of you, fallout for physicals!
What the fuck is going on?
Your weapons, Sergeant.
He wouldn't kill anybody...
Oh, bullshit, he's a fucking convict. You know how much he hated West --
Oh, bullshit, he's a fucking convict. You know how much he hated West --
I hated West, Childs hated West, everyone with a goddamn brain hated West but that doesn't mean we killed him!
Shut up. Let me see your grenades.
Why?
Why?
We were each given three so whoever killed West will be missing one.
Jesus, what happened?
West... he's dead.
Pike and I got separated... then I heard gunfire. Close.
So did we. Why didn't you come?
So you killed him?
I...
Whose blood is that, Jay?
West's. Any kindling for afire?
What do you mean, West's?
I mean I killed him. Isn't that what we all wanted?
Where have you been, Jay?
Wandering through a hurricane trying to find this place. It's gettin' bad out there -- Where's West?
Roberto, what the fuck?
We just want to check your pack --
We just want to check your pack --
Why?
You know it's not like that --
Do I?
Right?
Yeah...
You gotta untie me. I didn't do this thing, Ray.
You hated West more than any of us.
You hated West more than any of us.

You're the only one missing a grenade.
You're the only one missing a grenade.
Which anyone coulda taken out of my gear on the chopper. Were you watching your pack on the ride in?
Ray, this is my life here. I ain't gonna pretend I'm not happy West is gone, but you know I couldn't have done this. It's not in me.
If not you, then who?
If not you, then who?
Mueller.
Mueller.
Oh, come on --
Oh, come on --
We're sweeping our area and suddenly he's gone. Couple minutes later, phosphorous grenade pops off about a third of a click away --

That's exactly what he says about you.
That's exactly what he says about you.
Who you gonna trust, Ray? Him or your friend?
You hated West, Mueller loved him --
Enough to go to prison? Childs' PX scam, Mueller was in on it --
Enough to go to prison? Childs' PX scam, Mueller was in on it --
Bullshit.
Bullshit.
Look in my pack.
Look in my pack.
Why?
Why?
Just look. Little pocket.
Combat grade morphine. Mueller sold it to me.
You're lying --
You're lying --
Pull up my sleeve. Right arm.
Why... why didn't you tell me?
Becoming a morphine addict during Basic ain't exactly something you want to broadcast. Only Mueller and Childs know.
That still doesn't mean you didn't kill him.
You saw West, right? How was he killed?
You saw West, right? How was he killed?
Full clip to the body --

From up close or far away?
From up close or far away?
His chest was hamburger --
His chest was hamburger --
That's close range. You go full auto on a guy from close range, you're gonna be swimming in blood. Look at my uniform. Nothing.
Way I figure it, West must have found out about their little business and was gonna bust them, so they decided to get rid of him first...
They?
They?
Mueller and Childs. One of them must've taken the grenade from my pack on the chopper...
I... I don't know...
What don't you know?
What don't you know?
This is a lot of information to be getting... I have to think --
There's no time to think, Ray, we gotta get out of here! You untie me, we grab the guns, get Kendall and Nunez, and make a run for it --
No... no, we can just wait till we get back and then tell the M.P.'s --
No... no, we can just wait till we get back and then tell the M.P.'s --
We wait and I'm a dead man. I got a black face, a criminal record, and over a hundred other cadets who'll testify how much I hated West -- my court martial will take six minutes. It's either me or them, Ray, and you gotta decide right now.
A test will no doubt link you to the killing --
Put it down!
You... I've seen you around the Base. But you... You're not Army, are you?
Coast Guard, special detective detail. We feel this incident may have put the beaches of Florida at risk.
That's it. You're that policeman with friends in low places. Tell me, how's Guissepe Torres doing these days? Those racketeering indictments must have really been a downer --
Levi, you got about four hours before armed men show up here, put you on a plane to Washington, and lock you in a very small dark room. I suggest you talk to us.
I've done nothing wrong. I'm the victim here.
But not the only victim, right?
But not the only victim, right?
My, my, my, how did things turn so hostile so quickly? If I didn't know better, I'd say you two were out to get me.
My father is a powerful man. Over the years he's used that power to protect me, in one form or another, from certain... unpleasantries. I am a homosexual.
Senator Daddy must be thrilled.
Senator Daddy must be thrilled.
He is not, shall we say, wild about the idea. He has asked me on numerous occasions to be more discreet about my proclivities, and I have done my best to oblige him. However, in the last four weeks, I began a relationship with another cadet. What do you think of that?

I think you just blew "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" out of the fucking water.
I think you just blew "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" out of the fucking water.
The Sergeant discovered this relationship and wanted me expelled. My father interceded, so instead, West Sectioned me and made sure every other cadet knew that I was gay.
Levi, I don't know if you're familiar with investigative work, but we have this little thing called "motive" and you just gave yourself one.
You said you wanted to know what happened -- I'm telling you the truth.
You said you wanted to know what happened -- I'm telling you the truth.
What happened to "degrees"?
What happened to "degrees"?
I didn't kill him --
I didn't kill him --
Then who did?
Maybe I shouldn't tell you that. Maybe I should tell you I wasn't scared at all. But I was... Enough to almost kill him.
But you didn't.
But you didn't.
No. Poetic justice, though.
He admitted it.
Right in front of us. Mueller went after him but we held him back.
Why did he come back for you?
I honestly don't know. Maybe to have someone to cover for him. And I wish I could, but there's no doubt in my mind he killed those men.
Okay. I think that's it. He rises and walks to the door.
Mr. Hardy?
Somebody emptied a full clip into him --
Stop.
You tried to pin three stone murders on Dunbar --
How many murders did you cover up? One? Five? Maybe an even ten.
How many murders did you cover up? One? Five? Maybe an even ten.
Can I go to jail for punching a guy who's been shot?
Epileptic attacks are murder on your system. Rattle your internal organs like a paint mixer.
My heart weeps.
Is it the truth?
There's that word again. As I told you, I wasn't in the room when everyone started shooting.
Why did you tell us he shot everybody, Levi? You put him in for three murders, the man saved your life --
So I should stay silent about his misdeeds? The guns went off, I ran in, Childs shot me, Pike and Mueller were dead, and Dunbar was running out the door with the smoking gun --
So I should stay silent about his misdeeds? The guns went off, I ran in, Childs shot me, Pike and Mueller were dead, and Dunbar was running out the door with the smoking gun --
Dunbar was running out the door? Ohhhhhh... See that's where I was confused, because I thought you said Nunez was running out the door.
Dunbar was running out the door? Ohhhhhh... See that's where I was confused, because I thought you said Nunez was running out the door.
No. I said Dunbar.
No. I said Dunbar.
Huh. You know, I really thought you said Nunez. I thought you said "Dunbar was gone," My fault, I gotta check the tape on that. Oh, yeah we taped the last interview. This one too. Cause it'd be a real break for us to catch you in a lie.
I believe your next line is "What are you trying to hide?"
Well?
Well?
Sorry to disappoint. I'm on painkillers for the injury -- they cloud the mind. You're right, it was Nunez. Any more questions?
Dunbar will testify that you were.
Then we'll leave it up to the courts -- His word against mine. What does his father do again? Steelworker? Doesn't matter, I'm sure justice will be served. In any case, my father will definitely want to talk to you about all these questions, these accusations on his son. He's quite protective.
Something funny, Levi?
I was just thinking of what's going to happen to your careers when my father gets through with you.
Jail if he's lucky, the gas chamber if he's not --
I didn't do anything --
Why?
Because of what I saw. Who really killed West.
How do you know?
Because I was standing next to him.
Or you, Levi? When is it finally going to come out that you were the one who killed him?
I didn't --
I didn't --
But you can't prove it! You can't prove anything until we find the bodies!
You lied to us, Levi, you're going to the gas chamber unless you tell us where to find them!
I don't know --
I don't know --
Where are they!
Where are they!
Maybe --
Maybe --
MAYBE WHAT --
MAYBE WHAT --
Maybe he...
How are you?
Been better. I read about what's been happening with you... I should have called --

What kind of trouble are you in?
That bad?
Would I have called you if it wasn't? If there was any other way --

Tell me what I can do.
This is Warrant Officer Julia Osborne, the closest thing we have to an in- house investigator.
And here you are going out of house. How's that make you feel, Jules?
The official term for it is "Clusterfuck". By the time Beth hit us, I'd canceled all off base exercises save one -- a six man cadet team and their Drill out in the bush. We're missing three and the Sergeant. The cadets are in their eighth week of the cycle, nobody here knows much about them, up to and including their names. But the
It's not West, is it? Tell me it's not West.
A few years ago, the Army picked our good buddy as their go to non-com to trot out to the press to talk about the kinder, gentler military. He even did the standard video greeting played to all incoming Basic cadets across the country.
Well, he's a good soldier.
The exercise was one of his Section Eight "private sessions". Left around 2100 yesterday and were scheduled for pick up at 0630 this morning.
And the problem is you only got three.
And the problem is you only got three.
No, the problem is one's dead, one's got a bullet in his arm, and one won't talk. The one who won't talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pick-up.

I'm assuming that's what made him the dead one?
I'm assuming that's what made him the dead one?
Cadet Roberto R. Nunez. Killed right in front of me.
Which gives us about five hours. Why'd you call me?
The guy in interrogation said he'd only talk to a cop.

And I'm the closest thing to it, right?
Tom, bottom line: I let those kids go out there. If JAG shows up and I don't have any answers for them, my career is finished --
I'm not gonna let that happen.
He's not done by a longshot, I can get more out of him --
He can wait. Kendall's out of surgery.
Pike killed West, Dunbar killed Mueller, Childs, and Nunez.
Who killed Pike?
Who killed Pike?
Someone must have got a shot off. He wasn't exactly a moving target.
We've already been over the terrain twice. Nothing.
There was a hurricane, Bill, the wind probably moved it.

Not for me.
You mean not enough to save you.
JAG gets here in three hours. Try for the confession.
Tom, where are you going --
Home, I'm done.
Home, I'm done.
What about the confession?
You want a confession? Why don't you confess, Bill: people are dead and you don't give a shit about it! Only reason you called me is to protect your fucking job, you know this is your fault --
What the hell are you talking about --
What the hell are you talking about --
I'm talking about West! We had him, Bill, we were there. You're the fucking Base Commander, you knew what he did to Cadets and you let him go on the way he always he has --
What I said before --
Was dead right. You think Dunbar's on the level?
Was dead right. You think Dunbar's on the level?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Does Osborne agree?
It's over. Time of death was 4:42. JAG's been notified and I called the Senator myself. My report will reflect that his medical condition made this unavoidable... you two had no culpability in the matter.
That's horseshit and you know it.
That's horseshit and you know it.
Maybe. But it's my fault and I'll carry it.
You think you could explain all this to me?
I wouldn't know where to start. I guess it was about one man framing another. He thought if the other guy got blamed, people would over look his own wrong doings.
They're taking your command, aren't they?
The Senator...
I'm sorry, Bill.
Don't be. I'm not cut out to deal with the West's of the world.
Don't be. I'm not cut out to deal with the West's of the world.
You're a good soldier, Bill.
You're a good soldier, Bill.
I thought you said that wasn't a compliment.
It was so good, I actually forgot you're one of the bigger dogs now. The Base Commander. The one in control. You couldn't let him testify, could you?
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
If you let him testify then it would have all come out. West was supposed to take care of it out there, shut Nunez up and then disappear. But it got messy and people got killed. So you called your old pal Tom Hardy, figuring if worse came to worse, he'd cover for you.

I'm not going to cover for you, Bill. Not for this.
Stay where you are.
Or what? You've gone round the bend --
Or what? You've gone round the bend --
West had a partner. Someone who knew how to get things done.
What I can't understand is why you signed these. If you'd just let West take care of the paperwork, no one would have known, but you got careless. So when Pike finally told the truth you had to get rid of him, too.
That's preposterous --
That's preposterous --
Toxicology report came back. Kendall's attack was caused by a drug known as anephadrine, maybe you've heard of it. It's for asthmatics. If an epileptic takes enough, it kills them. I checked with the nurses at the hospital -- you're the only other person who visited Kendall.

You want to get into a finger pointing contest about character? The army kicked you out for drugs, the cops fired you for taking bribes from a mobster, and you think you can stand there and lecture me on codes of conduct? There's only one criminal standing in this room and it's you.

Not for long.
No more witnesses. West's a ghost. But it doesn't matter because we have your signature, the hospital log, and Kendall's toxicology report. And that'll be enough.
You're crazy --
You're crazy --
You can't duck this, Bill. I may have done every goddamn thing in my life wrong but I won't let this happen.

Hostile and uncooperative.
Fantastic. You want to tell me what's going on?
Ah, Christ
You knew Sergeant West?
You knew Sergeant West?
He was our Drill here. Man's older than sand.
I didn't mean that as a compliment.
Sergeant West's served for twenty- three years. He's the public face of the modern Army.

Gotta be honest, I love what you've done with the place --

It was for suspicion of bribery, it's really all in the wording --
