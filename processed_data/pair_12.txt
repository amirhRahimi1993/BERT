No, that's just it. No.
Where are we goin', John?
Somewheres. I don't know yet.
I'm hungry, John.
We'll steal somethin' to eat.

She talks to herself.

Kings! Why, honey, there was only one.
Kings! Why, honey, there was only one.
I mind you said there was two.
I mind you said there was two.
Well, shoot! Maybe there was!
John, when your Dad says 'come', you should mind him.
He ain't my Dad.
I'll see to Pearl.
I'll make coffee.
This watch is the nicest watch I ever had.
A feller can't just go around with run-down, busted watches.
Why, he told me what fine little lambs you and your sister both was.
Is that all?
Did you hear what I said, son?
Huh?
Huh?
Married! We have decided to go to Sistersville tomorrow, and when we come back --
Married! We have decided to go to Sistersville tomorrow, and when we come back --
You ain't my Dad! You won't never be my Dad!

-- and when we come back, we'll all be friends -- and share our fortunes together, John!
You think you can make me tell! But I won't! I won't! I won't!
Tell me what, boy?
Nothin'!
Nothin'!
Are we keeping secrets from each other, little lad?
Are we keeping secrets from each other, little lad?
No. No.
What are you doing, boy?
Getting Pearl to bed. I --

What's taking you so long about it?

It -- she --

What's that you're playing with, boy?

Pearl's junk. Mom gets mad when she plays out here and don't clean up afterward.
Pearl's junk. Mom gets mad when she plays out here and don't clean up afterward.
Come on, children!
Your mother says you tattled on me, boy. She says you told her that I asked you where that money was hid.
Yes. Yes.
Yes. Yes.
That wasn't very nice of you, John. Have a heart, boy.
She thinks that money's in the river, but you and me, we know better, don't we, boy?
I don't know nothin'!
I don't know nothin'!
The summer is young yet, little lad. Pearl?
Now! Where's it hid, honey?
I'll tell.
I'll tell.
I thought I told you to keep your mouth shut --
I thought I told you to keep your mouth shut --
NO, -- it ain't fair to make Pearl tell when she swore she wouldn't. I'll tell.
All right boy: where's the money?
In the cellar. Buried under a stone in the floor.
All right... Come along.
What?
What?
Go ahead of me -- the both of you.
You don't reckon I'd leave you.
Don't you believe me?
Don't you believe me?
Why sure, boy, sure.
Now where, boy? Mind; no tricks. I can't abide liars.
Yonder.
Now: Where?
Under the stone in the floor.
Pearl, shut up! Pearl, you swore!
You could save him, little bird.
Nothin'.
Come to me, boy!
John's a feller who likes to keep secrets.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
I'll tell you a secret.
I'll tell you a secret.
Yes?
Yes?
I knowed your Daddy. And do you know what your Daddy said to me? He said, "Tell my little girl Pearl there's to be no secrets between her and you."
I knowed your Daddy. And do you know what your Daddy said to me? He said, "Tell my little girl Pearl there's to be no secrets between her and you."
Yes?
Yes?
Now it's your turn.
Now it's your turn.
What secret shall I tell?
What secret shall I tell?
How old are you?
How old are you?
That's no secret. I'm five.
Sure, that's no secret.
What's your name?
What's your name?
You're just foolin'! My name's Pearl.
You're just foolin'! My name's Pearl.
Tst-tst! Then I reckon I'll have to try again! Where's the money hid?
You see? We can't have anything to do with John. You and me will go down to the parlor.
Miz Jenny! Miz Jenny!
Yes; John's bad.
Tell me another secret about my Dad.
O no! Your turn!
All right.
All right.
Where's the money hid.
John's bad.
Where's the money hid? Tell me, you little wretch, or I'll tear your arm off!
I'm hungry.
Why, sure. And there's fried chicken and candied sweets and cornsticks and apple cobbler!
Why, sure. And there's fried chicken and candied sweets and cornsticks and apple cobbler!
Can I have my supper please?
Can I have my supper please?
Naturally.
Naturally.
Can I have milk too?
Can I have milk too?
Yes. But first of all we'll have a little talk.
About our secrets.
No.
No.
Why, pray tell?
Why, pray tell?
Because John said I mustn't.
Just tell me now; where's the money hid?
But I swore. I promised John I wouldn't tell.
But I swore. I promised John I wouldn't tell.
JOHN -- DOESN'T -- MATTER! Can't I get that through your head, you poor, silly, disgusting little wretch!
You're Ruby, ain't you, my child?
Can I have this?
Can I have this?
Surely. I'd like to talk to you, my dear.
Surely. I'd like to talk to you, my dear.
Will you buy me a choclit sody?
Will you buy me a choclit sody?
O' course.
Why, you're the purtiest girl I've seen in all my wandering. Didn't nobody never tell you that, Ruby?
No. No one never did.
No. No one never did.
There's two new ones over at your place, ain't there Ruby?
What's their names?
Pearl and John.
Pearl and John.
Ahhh. And is there -- a doll?
Ahhh. And is there -- a doll?
Only she won't never let me play with it.
Only she won't never let me play with it.
Ahh!
Mister Powell?
A strange woman is a narrow pit!
Is there anythin' -- anythin'...?
It is my shame -- my crown of thorns. And I must wear it bravely.
Didn't you have no inkling?
Yes; from the first night.
Yes; from the first night.
The first night?
The first night?
Our honeymoon.
Our honeymoon.
How's that?
How's that?
She turned me out of the bed.
What do you figure to do?
Do? Why stay and take care of them little kids. Maybe it was never meant for a woman like Willa to taint their young lives.
That's mighty brave of you, Reverend.
I reckon it's been ordained this way, Brother Spoon.
I reckon it's been ordained this way, Brother Spoon.
Didn't -- didn't she leave no word?
Didn't -- didn't she leave no word?
A scrawl. On a piece of notepaper on the bureau.
She'll come draggin' her tail back home.
She'll not be back. I reckon I'd be safe in promisin' you that.
She'll not be back. I reckon I'd be safe in promisin' you that.
Maybe she's just run off on a spree.
John: take that look offen your face and act nice.
He don't mean no impudence; do you, boy? Do you, boy? Ah, many's the time poor Brother Ben told me about these youngins.
John, Mr. Powell has got something to tell you.
Well, John, the night before your father died, he told me what he did with that money.
Harry!
I was praying.
I was praying.
Oh, I'm sorry, Harry! I didn't know! I thought maybe --
You thought, Willa, that the moment you walked in that door I'd start in to pawing you in the abominable way men are supposed to do on their wedding night. Ain't that right, now?
No, Harry! I thought --
No, Harry! I thought --
I think it's time we got one thing perfectly clear, Willa. Marriage to me represents a blending of two spirits in the sight of Heaven.
Get up, Willa.
Harry, what --
Harry, what --
Get up.
Do you want more children, Willa?
I -- no, I --
I -- no, I --
It's the business of our marriage to mind those two you have now -- not to beget more.
It's the business of our marriage to mind those two you have now -- not to beget more.
Yes.
Are you through praying?
I'm through, Harry.
You were listening outside the parlor window.
It's not in the river, is it Harry?
It's not in the river, is it Harry?
Answer me!
Answer me!
Ben never told you he throwed it in the river? Did he?
Mornin', ladies.
How'do.
You're Miz Cooper, I take it.
It's about that John and that Pearl?
Shall I tell ye the little story of Right-Hand-Left-Hand -- the tale of Good and Evil?
It was with this left hand that old brother Cain struck the blow that laid his brother low --

Right funny, hain't it, how they rowed all the way up river in a ten- foot john-boat!
Gracious, gracious! You are a good woman, Miz Cooper!
How you figgerin' to raise them two without a woman?
How you figgerin' to raise them two without a woman?
The Lord will provide.
The Lord is merciful! What a day is this! -- And there's little John!
What's wrong, John?

Didn't you hear me, boy?
What do you want?
Them kids!

What are you after them for?

None of your business, Madam.
None of your business, Madam.
I'm givin' you to the count of three to get out that screen door; then I'm a-comin' across this kitchen shootin'!
Pearl and John!
Not this time! It was just one youngin -- a little boy babe. And do you know who he was, children?
I been bad!
Ruby, you didn't have no money to buy this.
Ruby, you didn't have no money to buy this.
You'll whip me!
You'll whip me!
When did I ever?

This man down at the Drugstore...

What you been up to?

I been out with men.
This gentleman warn't like them! He just give me a sody and the book.
Now who was this?
Now who was this?
He never asked me for nothin'.
He never asked me for nothin'.
He must have wanted somethin', Ruby. A man don't waste time on a girl unless he gets something.
What'd you all talk about?
Pearl and John.
Pearl and John.
John and Pearl!
Miz Cooper!
What?
What?
The man! The man!
Nancy have any severe childhood illnesses? Scarlet Fever? High temperatures -- concussions?
No, nothing.
Nightmares are expected after psychological trauma. Don't worry, they go away.
I sure as hell hope so.
They're just simple tests, Nan. We'll both be right here.
Look, I know it's been frightening, I know your dreams have seemed real. But... it's okay. Okay?
Look, I know it's been frightening, I know your dreams have seemed real. But... it's okay. Okay?
Please, Nancy. Trust us.
How long's this been going on?
Since the murder. She was fine before that.
Since the murder. She was fine before that.
Not to worry. No signs of pathology in Nancy's EEG or pulse rate. I'd guess what we've got is a normal young girl who just happens to have gone through two days of hell.
Not to worry. No signs of pathology in Nancy's EEG or pulse rate. I'd guess what we've got is a normal young girl who just happens to have gone through two days of hell.
It's just made her think... her dreams are real...
Okay, good. She's asleep.
Thank God.
What the hell are dreams, anyway?
Mysteries. Incredible body hookus pokus. Truth is we still don't know what they are or where they come from. As for nightmares... Did you know that in the last three years twenty Filipino refugees in California died in the middle of nightmares? Not from heart attacks, either. They just died.
What happened? That needle sank like a rock.
She's entering deep sleep now. Heart rate's a little high due to anxiety, but otherwise she's nicely relaxed. All normal. She could dream at any time now. Right now she's like a diver on the bottom of an ocean no one's mapped yet. Waiting to see what shows up.
How can you tell?
R.E.M.'s. Rapid eye movements. The eyes follow the dream -- their movement picks up on this --
Oh my god, oh my god...
Get the kit!
Worked like a charm.
Jesus.
It's just a stupid cat.
Then bring us back its tail and whiskers.
So we'll guard her together. Through the night. In each others' arms like we always said.
Glen. Not now. I mean, we're here for Tina now, not for ourselves.
Why's she so bothered by a stupid nightmare, anyway?
Because he was scary, that's why.
Because he was scary, that's why.
Who was scary?
What the hell's going on!?
Oh -- jeez -- Glen! Rod's gone ape!
You okay?
Yeah. Something slippery all over here... Tina?
Sometimes I wish you didn't live right across the street.
Shut up and let me in. You ever stand on a rose trellis in your bare feet?
Guess I did.
Haven't slept, have you?
Haven't slept, have you?
Not really.
M'god, I look twenty years old. You have any weird dreams last night?
Slept like a rock.
Slept like a rock.
Well at least I have an objective wall to bounce this off. You believe it's possible to dream about what's going to happen?
Well at least I have an objective wall to bounce this off. You believe it's possible to dream about what's going to happen?
No.
No.
You believe in the Boogey Man?

One two, Freddie's coming for you? No. Rod killed Tina. He's a fruitcake and you know it.

You believe in anything?
You believe in anything?
I believe in you, me, and Rock and Roll. And I'm not too sure about you lately.
Listen, I got a crazy favor to ask.
Uh-oh...
Uh-oh...
It's nothing too hard or anything. I'm just going to... LOOK for someone, and... I want you to be sort of a... guard. Okay?
Okay?
Okay, okay. I think.
Jesus, it's dark in here.
Shhh. Now listen, here's what we're gonna do...
Yeah. So?
Just checking -- keep out of sight!
Whenever I get nervous I eat.
And if you can't do that, you sleep.
And if you can't do that, you sleep.
Used to. Not anymore.
You ever read about the Balinese way of dreaming?
No.
No.
They got a whole system they call 'dream skills'. So, if you have a nightmare, for instance like falling, right?
They got a whole system they call 'dream skills'. So, if you have a nightmare, for instance like falling, right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Instead of screaming and getting nuts, you say, okay, I'm gonna make up my mind that I fall into a magic world where I can get something special, like a poem or song. They get all their art literature from dreams. Just wake up and write it down. Dream skills.
And what if they meet a monster in their dream? Then what?
They turn their back on it. Takes away its energy, and it disappears.
They turn their back on it. Takes away its energy, and it disappears.
What happens if they don't do that?

I guess those people don't wake up to tell what happens.

Well what you reading it for?
Hello?
Hi.
Hi.
Oh. Hi, how y'doing?
Much better.

Who?
Who?
The killer.
The killer.
You do?
You do?
Yeah, and if he gets me, I'm pretty sure you're next.
Me!? Why would anyone want to kill me?!
Don't ask -- just give me some help nailing this guy when I bring him out.
Bring him out of what?
My dream.
My dream.
How you plan to do that?

Just like I did the hat. Have a hold of the sucker when you wake me up.

Good, then you won't mind cold-cocking this guy when I bring him out.
Good, then you won't mind cold-cocking this guy when I bring him out.

You heard me. I grab him in the dream -- you see me struggling so you wake me up. We both come out, you cold cock the fucker, and we got him. Clever, huh?

Meanwhile...?

Meanwhile whatever you do don't fall asleep. Midnight.
How you doing, pal?
Okay. Hi, dad.
Rod's not a lunatic.
You got a sane explanation for what he did?
She dreamed this would happen...
What?
What?
She had a nightmare about somebody trying to kill her, last night. That's why we were there; she was afraid to sleep alone.
You used me, daddy!
What the hell you doing going to school today, anyway -- your mother told me you didn't even sleep last night!
Decide to take a day off after all?
Dad, I want to see Rod Lane.
Only family allowed, Nancy. You know the drill.
Just want to talk to him a second.
Just want to talk to him a second.
He's dangerous.
He's dangerous.
You don't know he did it.
You don't know he did it.
No, I know, thanks to your own testimony, that he was locked in a room with a girl who went in alive and came out in a rubber bag.
Dad -- what you doing here?
It so happens I work here, and there's an unsolved murder. I don't like unsolved murders, especially ones my daughter's mixed up in -- what are you doing here at this hour? You're supposed to be getting some sleep.
Hello Nancy.
Hi daddy. I know what happened.
Hi daddy. I know what happened.
Then you know more than I do -- I haven't even been upstairs.
Then you know more than I do -- I haven't even been upstairs.
You know he's dead though, right?
I've got a proposition for you. Listen very carefully, please.
Nan, I --
Nan, I --
Please. I'm gonna go get the guy who did it and bring him to you. I just need you be right there to arrest him. Okay?
Please. I'm gonna go get the guy who did it and bring him to you. I just need you be right there to arrest him. Okay?
Just tell me who did it and I'll go get him, baby.
Just tell me who did it and I'll go get him, baby.
Fred Krueger did it, Daddy, and only I can get him. It's my nightmare he comes to.
-- I want you to come over here and break the door down exactly twenty minutes from now -- can you do that?
Sure, but...
Sure, but...
That'll be exactly half past midnight. Time for me to fall asleep and find him.
That'll be exactly half past midnight. Time for me to fall asleep and find him.
Sure, sure, honey. You just do that -- get yourself some sleep -- that's what I've been saying all along.
Sure, sure, honey. You just do that -- get yourself some sleep -- that's what I've been saying all along.
And you'll be here to catch him, right?
Sure, okay, I'll be there. Now you just turn in and get some rest, sweetheart. Please. Deal?
Deal.
DAD! GET US OUTTA HERE!
Oh, Jesus -- Nancy! Hey! We got a fire!
Lieutenant Thompson. Sorry to wake you, but --
I'd've canned your ass if you hadn't. What you got?
What's the Coroner got to say?
Something like a razor was the weapon, but nothing found on the scene.
Looks like her boyfriend did it. Rod Lane. Musician type, arrests for brawling, dope --
Terrific. What the hell was she doing there?
Terrific. What the hell was she doing there?
She lived there.
She lived there.
I don't mean her --
Tell her I'm not here, tell her...
Uh, she just saw you, sir...
Get outside and watch her house. If you see anything funny call me.
'Anything funny' like what?
Who? Who did that?
Krueger.
Krueger.
Krueger?
Had to've done it. No one else was in there.
How you know that?
How you know that?
Cause I thought Glen was gonna sneak out to see your lunatic daughter, that's why. So I locked him in his room! Sorry. Anyways, the door was still locked when we heard the screams.
Maybe god's punishing us all...
Keep your head -- this is a fucking flesh and blood killer we're talking about.
Keep your head -- this is a fucking flesh and blood killer we're talking about.
Like Rod Lane?
Apparently he was crazy jealous. Nancy said they'd had a fight, Rod and Tina.
It wasn't that serious...
It wasn't that serious...
Maybe you don't think murder's serious --
Where you think you're going?
School.
School.
I could hear you tossing and turning all night, kiddo. You've no business going to school.
Did you sleep?
I'll sleep in study hall, promise. I'd rather keep busy, you know?
Right home after.
Right home after. See you.
Nancy, don't fall asleep in there.
I won't.
I won't.
Get into bed.
Get into bed.
I will.
What?
You're not falling asleep, are you? You could drown, you know.
You're not falling asleep, are you? You could drown, you know.
Mother, for petesakes.
Mother, for petesakes.
It happens all the time. I've got some warm milk all ready for you. Why don't you jump into bed? I'm gonna turn on your electric blanket, too. C'mon, now.
It happens all the time. I've got some warm milk all ready for you. Why don't you jump into bed? I'm gonna turn on your electric blanket, too. C'mon, now.
Warm milk. Gross.
You okay?
Great
Great
To bed with you, c'mon.
No television, forget the homework, no phone calls.
No, Mother. Yes, Mother. No, Mother.
No, Mother. Yes, Mother. No, Mother.
And no school tomorrow, either. You take a little vacation, relax and rest for a change.
And no school tomorrow, either. You take a little vacation, relax and rest for a change.
Yes, Mother. G'night.
Take this, it'll help you sleep.
Right.
I must be going nuts...
Nancy?
You okay?
Yeah. Just had a little dream. I'm falling right back to sleep.
Yeah. Just had a little dream. I'm falling right back to sleep.
Okay... You need anything, just call.
Okay... You need anything, just call.
Okay.
Go even crazier?
I don't think you're going crazy -- and stop drinking that damn coffee!
I don't think you're going crazy -- and stop drinking that damn coffee!
Did you ask Daddy to have the hat examined?
Did you ask Daddy to have the hat examined?
I threw that filthy thing away -- I don't know what you're trying to prove with it, but --
What I learned at the dream clinic, that's what I'm trying to prove. Rod didn't kill Tina, and he didn't hang himself. It's this guy -- he's after us in our dreams.
But that's just not reality, Nancy!
It's real, Mamma. Feel it.
Put that damned thing down!
Screw sleep!
Nancy!
What's with the bars?
S'curity.
Mom, I want to know what you know about Fred Krueger.
Dead and gone.
Dead and gone.
I want to know how, where -- if you don't tell me, I'm going to call daddy.
Your father the cop. That's a good one. Forget Fred Krueger. You don't want to know, believe me.
I do want to know. He's not dead and gone -- he's after me and if I sleep he'll get me! I've got to know!
Oh lawyers got fat and the judge got famous, but someone forgot to sign the search warrant in the right place, and Fred Krueger was free, just like that.
So he's alive?
Bunch of us parents tracked him down after they let him go. Found him in an old boiler room, just like before. Saw him lying there in that caked red and yellow sweater he always wore, drunk an' asleep with his weird knives by his side...
Go on...
All these years you've kept those things buried down here? In our own house?
Proof he's declawed. As for him, we buried him good and deep.
Give me the key, mother.
I don't even have it on me, so forget it.
Guess I should'n'a done it.
Just sleep now, Mom.
Just sleep now, Mom.
Just wanted to protect you, Nan. Just wanted to protect you...
Feeling better?
They say you've bottomed out when you can't remember the night before. No more drinking, Baby, suddenly I just don't feel like it any more.
We got her mother's bed. You two got the rest.
We should get her out of here...
Your old man thinks I did it, don't he?
He doesn't know you. Couldn't you change?
He doesn't know you. Couldn't you change?
The cops were all over my house. They'll kill me for sure.
The cops were all over my house. They'll kill me for sure.
Nobody's gonna kill you.
I never touched her.
You were screaming like crazy.
Someone else was there.
The door was locked from your side.
And then what happened?
I told you. It was dark, but I'm sure there was someone else IN there, under the covers with her.
How could somebody get under the covers with you guys without you knowing it?
How the fuck do I know? I don't expect you to believe me.
No.
Well then how can you say somebody else was there?
Well then how can you say somebody else was there?
Because somebody cut her. While I watched.
What you mean 'all at once'?
I mean, it was as if there were four razors cutting her at the same time. But invisible razors. She just... opened up...
Do you think I did it?
No.
Rod says the sweetest things.
He's nuts about you.
He's nuts about you.
Yeah, nuts.
Anyway, I'm too tired to worry about the creep. Couldn't get back to sleep at all. So what you dream?
Forget it, the point is, everybody has nightmares once in a while. No biggy.
I can't believe his mother let him come over here.
Right. Well, she didn't, exactly...
Nice to have a fire.
Really. Turn 'er up a little.
Maybe we should call Rod, have him come over too. He might get jealous.
Rod and I are done. He's too much of a maniac.
What you dream?
I dreamed about this guy in a dirty red and yellow sweater; I dream in color, y'know; he walked into the room I was in, right, right through the wall, like it was smoke or something, and just stared at me. Sort of... obscenely. Then he walked out through the wall on the other side. Like he'd just come to check me out...
What the hell you doing here?
Came to make up, no big deal. Your ma home?
Came to make up, no big deal. Your ma home?
Of course. What's that?
You feel better now, right?
Jungle man fix Jane.
Jungle man fix Jane.
No more fights?
No more fights?
No more fights.
No more fights.
Good. No more nightmares for either of us then.
When did you have a nightmare?
Guys can have nightmares too, y'know. You ain't got a corner on the fucking market or something.
Thank you, Comrade.
Have you any money?
Well, here are fifty francs.
Thank you, Comrade, thank you.
Thank you, Comrade, thank you.
Bring me forty-five back.
Bring me forty-five back.
Naturally, Comrade.
What is it, Ninotchka?
It's from Paris.
From Leon.
From Leon!... How is he?... Come, tell us... open it... tell us... how is he?
Good evening, Anna.
Good evening, Ninotchka.
Good evening, Ninotchka.
Aren't you late?
Aren't you late?
No, the opera starts an hour later tonight on account of the parade.
They didn't let me. I am in disgrace. Last week at the performance of Carmen I played a sour note. The conductor got so excited he yelled, "There's sabotage in the string section!"
Too bad... you missed an inspiring day, Anna.
Too bad... you missed an inspiring day, Anna.
I know... my heart is sad... but my feet are happy. When all the tanks and guns were roaring over the Red Square I sat here all by myself and played a Beethoven sonata. Not bad at all. Are you expecting someone?

A few friends... just a little dinner party.
A few friends... just a little dinner party.
What are you serving?
What are you serving?
An omelet.
An omelet.
An omelet! Aren't you living a little above your ration?
An omelet! Aren't you living a little above your ration?
Well, I've saved up two eggs and each of my friends is bringing his own so we'll manage.
Well, I've saved up two eggs and each of my friends is bringing his own so we'll manage.
It just goes to prove the theory of our State. If you stand alone it means a boiled egg but if you're true to the collective spirit and stick together you've got an omelet. That reminds me... have you heard the latest they're telling about the Kremlin?
I'll tell you later. That Gurganov, you never know whether he's on his way to the washroom or the Secret Police.
You should be more careful, Anna.
You should be more careful, Anna.
And you too, Ninotchka.
And you too, Ninotchka.
About what?
About what?
Ever since you have been back from Paris...
Ever since you have been back from Paris...
I haven't talked to anyone about Paris. I haven't said a word.
I haven't talked to anyone about Paris. I haven't said a word.
That's just it. It makes people feel queer. I dont' want you to get in any trouble.
That's just it. It makes people feel queer. I dont' want you to get in any trouble.
I have nothing to hide.
I have nothing to hide.
You should. I'll show you.
When I passed through the laundry yard today I saw all the women huddled around this so I brought it up here. Things like this create a bad feeling. First they didn't know whose it was. Then they saw the Paris label and did it start a commotion! Some said it's what we all ought to wear and others said it's like hanging foreign
I see.
I see.
You know how it is today... all you have to do is wear a pair of silk stockings and they suspect you of counter-revolution.
You know how it is today... all you have to do is wear a pair of silk stockings and they suspect you of counter-revolution.
Thank you, Anna. I'll dry it up here when I wash it next. I should hate to see our country endangered by my underwear.
Thank you, Anna. I'll dry it up here when I wash it next. I should hate to see our country endangered by my underwear.
Ninotchka, you know I am your friend, you can trust me.... Did you bring back anything else?
No, I left everything in Paris. I just happened to be wearing this.
Tell me... what else did you have?
Tell me... what else did you have?
Well, a hat...
Well, a hat...
What was it like?
What was it like?
It was very silly.... I would be ashamed to wear it here.
It was very silly.... I would be ashamed to wear it here.
As beautiful as that? What else? Come, tell me.
As beautiful as that? What else? Come, tell me.
An evening gown.

A dress you wear in the evening.

When you get up you put on a negligee, and then you change to a morning frock.

You mean to tell me you wear a different dress for different times of the day?
You mean to tell me you wear a different dress for different times of the day?
Yes.
Yes.
Now, Ninotchka, you're exaggerating.
Now, Ninotchka, you're exaggerating.
No, my dear, it is true. That's how they live in the other world. Here we dress to have our bodies covered... to keep warm....
No, my dear, it is true. That's how they live in the other world. Here we dress to have our bodies covered... to keep warm....
And there?
And there?
Well, sometimes they're not completely covered but... they don't freeze.
Well, sometimes they're not completely covered but... they don't freeze.
They must have wonderful materials to make a thing like this so soft... something you don't even see.

You feel it, though.

Ninotchka, I wouldn't bring this up if we weren't such good friends.

What is it, Anna?

You know I told you that Pavlov and I are going to get married when he comes back from the maneuvers. Would it be asking too much...
You know I told you that Pavlov and I are going to get married when he comes back from the maneuvers. Would it be asking too much...
You want this?
You want this?
Just for the honeymoon.
Just for the honeymoon.
You can have it for good. It is my wedding present.
Are you the Buljanoff who fought on the barricades? And now you are afraid to take a room with a bath?
I don't want to go to Siberia.
Comrades! Comrades! Don't let's give in so quickly. After all we have to uphold the prestige of Russia.
All right, let's uphold it for another ten minutes.
You wouldn't like Razinin.
He's a bad man. Sends people to Siberia!
And how is Lord Lavenham?
...and little Lady Beatrice?
Are we free, Buljanoff?
Possibly.
No, that's not him...
Positively not!
That's her.
Imagine! The niece of the Czar opening the door for us.
Imagine! The niece of the Czar opening the door for us.
Once in Petersburg I was driving down the Nevsky Prospect in my cart and Her Highness in her troika swept down from the opposite direction, and when I couldn't make way quick enough she spat in my face.
You must help us, Leon... if you don't win her over we're on our way to Siberia!
Or it might be the firing squad!
Or it might be the firing squad!
Or we can't go back to Russia!
Imagine, for once in our lives we were in Paris and we never went to the Eiffel Tower.
That's right.
If you hadn't given Commissar Razinin such a wonderful report about us, who knows what would have happened?
I can tell you exactly.
A little more tact... look how nicely she's fixed the table -- all for us.
How nicely you've fixed the table, Ninotchka.
Can you blame them?... at least the May Day parade is over.
That's another thing... it's spring.
It is, Ninotchka! It is! He must have been in Paris! You can see it in his whole attitude! He just picked up a crumb of our black bread, shook his head, and dropped it.
If you asked him why he left France I bet he couldn't name one good reason.
If you asked him why he left France I bet he couldn't name one good reason.
I should be a swallow! Right now I would be sitting in front of the Café de Paris picking up flakes of French pastry that would melt in my bill.
Let's fill it with confitures, des prunes...
...des raisins de Madère, des framboises...
And the surprise is there's nothing in it.
I know, but if we can't put in all these wonderful things at least let's put in some imagination. In that one omelet we'll taste the whole of Paris!
We are not comrades any more... we are friends, Ninotchka.
Imagine, we don't have to whisper any longer.
...it may step out of a bazaar... it may wait for you in a corridor... it may hide in the shadow of a minaret....
Right now it's on the balcony.
Just a minute -- just a minute -- I have nothing against the idea but I still say let's go back to the Hotel Terminus. Moscow made our reservations there, we are on an official mission, and we have no right to change the orders of our superior.
Where is your courage, Comrade Buljanoff?
Now Comrades, I warn you... if it gets out in Moscow that we stay in the Royal Suite we will get into terrible trouble.
We'll just say we had to take it on account of the safe. That's a perfect excuse. There was no other safe big enough.
Capitalistic methods...
They accumulate millions by taking loss after loss.
He's cutting our throat...
But what can we do?... We have to accept.
We don't like Razinin.
We like you, Leon -- don't we like Leon?
Misha! Misha!
What is it?
What is it?
A telegram from Moscow! It must have been here all day!
That must be the one!
Yes, he looks like a comrade!
We had to take it on account of the safe.
For ourselves... we are much happier now since we moved to a little room next to the servants' quarters.
And Leonitchka! What she said about us...!
And they might believe her in Moscow.
And they might believe her in Moscow.
What do you mean they might -- they will!
Yes! We could stay with Leon!
Leon, how would you like to have three lifelong friends?
You know what they say -- there's nothing like home.
That's right... and we might as well face it.
Let's be happy that we're all alive.
And that's something we owe to Ninotchka.
What a lovely room you have here.
How many families live here with you?
She's right... anyhow let's talk ourselves into it.
Just see how happy the people look... from here....
And if it is too late for you your children will eat it.
Let's forget the future... let's stop being sentimental... let's start that omelet.
We can say whatever we want. We can shout... we can complain... Look... The service in this hotel is terrible! See? Nobody comes... nobody pays any attention. That's freedom.
No, that's bad management.
Is there anything I can do for you, monsieur?
No, no.
I am Comrade Buljanoff.
Monsieur.
Monsieur.
May I ask how much your rooms are?
May I ask how much your rooms are?
Well, gentlemen, I'm afraid our rates are rather high.
Well, gentlemen, I'm afraid our rates are rather high.
Why should you be afraid?
How are things in Moscow?
Very good. The last mass trials were a great success. There are going to be fewer but better Russians.
This is the apartment we have reserved for you, Comrade Yakushova. I hope you like it.
Which part of the room is mine?
Which lawyer?
You didn't get legal advice?
You didn't get legal advice?
We didn't want to get mixed up with lawyers. They are very expensive here. If you just say hello to a lawyer... well, there goes another cow.
Comrade Buljanoff...
Yes, Comrade?
Yes, Comrade?
Do you spell Buljanoff with one or two f's?
Do you spell Buljanoff with one or two f's?
With two f's, if you please.
Is there anything I can do, Comrade?
You might get me an accurate map of Paris. I want to use my spare time to inspect the public utilities and make a study of all outstanding technical achievements in the city.
You might get me an accurate map of Paris. I want to use my spare time to inspect the public utilities and make a study of all outstanding technical achievements in the city.
Yes, Comrade.
There's something else which I know will appeal to you. A visit to the Paris sewers. They tell me it is extremely instructive.
Huh?... Why don't you get a haircut, Buljanoff? You all look so wintry, Comrades. And why do we always keep the windows closed? Isn't it amazing, at home there's still snow and ice and here... Look at the birds. I always felt a little hurt that our swallows deserted us in the winter for capitalistic countries. Now I know why. We have the high
Now let's forget everything except that we're together.
That's right.
Let's not close our eyes. There are many good things to see here too.
I think I need my glasses.
Comrades... I'm out of the omelet.
Don't worry... there will be enough.
It is high time you got out of Russia.
I must be stern with you.
Don't forget, the day will come when you will have to face Razinin.
Good old Razinin! Is he still alive? How does he manage?
Good old Razinin! Is he still alive? How does he manage?
But, Comrades...
Is it possible to bring you back to reality for a moment? I must have a complete report of your negotiations and a detailed expense account.
Don't ask for it, Ninotchka. There is a Turkish proverb which says, "If something smells bad, why put your nose in it?"
Don't ask for it, Ninotchka. There is a Turkish proverb which says, "If something smells bad, why put your nose in it?"
And there is a Russian saying: "The cat who has cream on his whiskers had better find good excuses."
And there is a Russian saying: "The cat who has cream on his whiskers had better find good excuses."
With our cream situation what it is, it is Russia which should apologize to the cats.
With our cream situation what it is, it is Russia which should apologize to the cats.
Friends... friends, Buljanoff, Iranoff...
All you have to do is say "open sesame."
I don't know how I can get you out of it this time. How will it end? What will happen to you?
I don't know how I can get you out of it this time. How will it end? What will happen to you?
Shall we tell her?
Guest?
We have opened a restaurant...
We are not only serving good food, we are serving our country... we are making friends.
Who gave you this idea? What is responsible for all this?
You think because you represent the former Duchess...
The Duchess...
The Duchess...
The former Duchess!
The former Duchess!
In any case, gentlemen, a charming, beautiful, exquisite woman. I warn you, if this case comes to trial it will be before a French court, and when the Duchess takes the stand...
Not that we are giving in one inch, but tell us... what is in your mind?
Well, gentlemen, how about my proposition?
About this telegram to Moscow. Why should you bother? I'll write it for you.
Leon... Leonitchka... Why are you so good to us?
Didn't we put up a strong resistance?
Oh, yes, yes.
Boys, boys... don't forget Russia is your mother country. Three sons walking out all at once... that's too much for any mother.
Well, if your mother turns against you, you have to look for someone to adopt you.
Good morning, Your Highness.
Good morning, Gaston.
Good morning, Gaston.
Count d'Algout is still asleep.
Count d'Algout is still asleep.
That's all right.
Nonsense. How can you fight the Reds and make yourself agreeable to the Whites if you don't keep up your strength.
Shall I draw your bath, sir?
A blue shirt, perhaps?
Blue? Let's offset his mood. Find a striped one, and brighten it with a great blaze of tie.
Blue? Let's offset his mood. Find a striped one, and brighten it with a great blaze of tie.
Very well, Your Highness.
Good evening, Gaston.
Good evening, Monsieur.
Count d'Algout, there have been several telephone...
Go to bed.
Your breakfast, monsieur.
I don't feel like any breakfast.
What time have you, Gaston?
Eight forty-two, sir.

I guess it is eight forty-two.

You seem to be a bit nervous, sir.

I am, Gaston.

If you will forgive me, ever since you met that Bolshevik lady I've noticed a distinct change in you, sir.
If you will forgive me, ever since you met that Bolshevik lady I've noticed a distinct change in you, sir.
Have you?
Have you?
Decidedly. Yesterday I was greatly amazed when I came from the market and found that you had made your bed, sir.

And Gaston, I was happier all day long. I felt I'd contributed something.

Well, sir, if you should do it again, which I hope you won't, please remember the order. Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet.
Well, sir, if you should do it again, which I hope you won't, please remember the order. Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet.
Ah, there's something poetic about the simple processes of labor. Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet... it should be set to music!
Ah, there's something poetic about the simple processes of labor. Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet... it should be set to music!
May I add, sir, that it was with great amazement that I found a copy of Karl Marx's Capital on your night table. That is a socialistic volume which I refuse to so much as dust, sir. I view with alarm, sir, the influence over you of this Bolshevik lady.

I can't follow you, Gaston, isn't it about time that you realized the unfairness of your position? You being my servant? Wouldn't you like to stand on an equal footing with me?
I can't follow you, Gaston, isn't it about time that you realized the unfairness of your position? You being my servant? Wouldn't you like to stand on an equal footing with me?
No, sir.
No, sir.
Isn't there any revolt in you? Sometimes when I order you around don't you feel like kicking me in the pants?
Isn't there any revolt in you? Sometimes when I order you around don't you feel like kicking me in the pants?
No, sir.
No, sir.
Oh, you're a reactionary! Don't you look forward to the day when you can come in here and stand square on your two feet and say, "Hey, you, d'Algout! from now on it's going to be share and share alike"?
Oh, you're a reactionary! Don't you look forward to the day when you can come in here and stand square on your two feet and say, "Hey, you, d'Algout! from now on it's going to be share and share alike"?
Emphatically not, sir. The prospect terrifies me. Now, don't misunderstand me, sir, I don't resent your not paying me for the past two months, but the thought that I should split my bank account with you... that you should take half of my life's savings... that is really too much for me.
Your Highness...
Yes, General Savitzky?
Yes, General Savitzky?
I want you to know all the White Russian exiles in Paris are keeping their fingers crossed about the jewels. They are very interested in the case. Swana suspects her countrymen.
I want you to know all the White Russian exiles in Paris are keeping their fingers crossed about the jewels. They are very interested in the case. Swana suspects her countrymen.
Are they indeed? Thank you.

They hope the settlement will bring you a fortune.

General, please... if you hear any rumors that I am a charitable person, will you please kill them at their source?
You're looking magnificent, Leon... ...isn't he, General Savitzky?
Yes.
General, would you mind making my excuses at our table? I'll be back in a few moments.
Certainly.
Good evening, Your Highness.
Good evening, Louis. You seem to be very crowded tonight. Can you manage a table near the floor?

Certainly, Your Highness, this way please... Count d'Algout made the reservation this afternoon.
Certainly, Your Highness, this way please... Count d'Algout made the reservation this afternoon.
Count d'Algout...
Count d'Algout...
It is only a small table but it will be no trouble to put in some extra chairs.
Only one in the rear, I'm afraid.
That's perfect!
Is this satisfactory?
Thank you, Louis.
Comrades, why should we lie to each other? It's wonderful.
Let's be honest. Have we anything like it in Russia?
They tell me when you ring once the valet comes in; when you ring twice you get the waiter; and do you know what happens when you ring three times? A maid comes in -- a French maid.
Comrades, if we ring nine times... let's go in.
I don't want to go to the Hotel Terminus.
If Lenin were alive he would say, "Buljanoff, Comrade, for once in your life you're in Paris. Don't be a fool. Go in there and ring three times."
If Lenin were alive he would say, "Buljanoff, Comrade, for once in your life you're in Paris. Don't be a fool. Go in there and ring three times."
He wouldn't say that. What he would say is "Buljanoff, you can't afford to live in a cheap hotel. Doesn't the prestige of the Bolsheviks mean anything to you? Do you want to live in a hotel where you press for the hot water and cold water comes and when you press for the cold water nothing comes out at all? Phooey, Buljanoff!"
We can wait.
Do we give the impression of people who are pressed for money?
You know, Monsieur Mercier, this is all non-sense.
These may have been the jewels of the Duchess Swana, but, like all private property, they were confiscated by the State.
We can call our ambassador.
I give you my word! They were confiscated legally!
That won't help you! You can't intimidate us!
Soviet Russia will put all its might behind this case.
Yes, Leon...
What is it, my boy?
Leon, my little boy.
Oh, Leon, you are so good.
Halt negotiations immediately. Envoy extraordinary arrives Thursday six ten with full power. Your authority cancelled herewith. Razinin.
It is Thursday!
This is a fine thing. Maybe we've missed him already.
How can you find somebody without knowing what he looks like?
We don't blame you, Leon, but when we came from Russia we believed in simplicity...
We avoided luxury and extravagance and today... well, if you were to offer us a glass of champagne, we wouldn't say no.
They tell me it has a wonderful restaurant on the second floor.
While you eat, you look at the view.
Let's do that.
It's a real Paris reunion.
It's a real Paris reunion.
If you close your eyes and listen to our voices we might be in Paris.
...des petites fraises des bois... de la crème de Bretagne...
...so it blows up that big... what they call an Omelette Surprise!
Well, I think it's getting late. Good night, Ninotchka.
Thank you for a wonderful dinner.
That was our idea when we first came. All we thought we would get out of this trip was a Turkish bath, but... we learned better.
Ninotchka, we are in the magic East, the country of Aladdin and His Lamp...
Ninotchka, we are in the magic East, the country of Aladdin and His Lamp...
...Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves... into one single hour you can crowd a thousand and one nights.
Don't call it desertion. Our little restaurant... that is our Russia... the Russia of borscht, the Russia of beef Stroganoff, blinis with sour cream...
...the Russia of piroshki... people will eat and love it.
There's something in Constantinople... something irresistible....
...it is in the air... it may come around the corner as you walk down the street....
We don't want to be disturbed.
My name is Count d'Algout. I telephoned.
My name is Count d'Algout. I telephoned.
If you want to see us you must come later.
If you want to see us you must come later.
I just want a word with Monsieur Mercier.
I just want a word with Monsieur Mercier.
But you can't...
Well, gentlemen... how about a little lunch?
Get out of here!
Get out of here!
Don't look so gloomy, gentlemen. All is not lost. You may have a chance.
All right, go ahead, get her on the witness stand! What can she say?
But how will she look? The fashions this spring are very becoming to her. Gentlemen, the judge will be French, the jury will be French, everybody in that courtroom will be French. Have you ever seen a French court when a beautiful woman sits on the witness stand and lifts her skirt a little? You sit down and pull up your pants and where

I suppose you expect us to hand over the jewels?
I suppose you expect us to hand over the jewels?
Oh, no, no. I am not a highwayman, I'm just a nuisance. All I'm trying to do is make things as difficult as possible.
What proposition?
I just said let's have a little lunch. Room service.
What's the name of that Commissar on the Board of Trade?
Razinin.
Razinin.
Razinin, Board of Trade, Moscow.
And if we have to go to Siberia...
I'll send you a muff.
She says she won't be intimidated by parasites. She called the Duchess a blood-sucking aristocrat and a blackmailer.
What did she say about me?
What did she say about me?
I think she covered you with the parasites.
You found your way to us and we weren't easy to reach, were we?
No, no.
I am looking for Michael Simonovitch Iranoff.
I am Michael Simonovitch Iranoff.
I am Michael Simonovitch Iranoff.
I am Nina Ivanovna Yakushova, Envoy Extraordinary, acting under direct orders of Comrade Commissar Razinin. Present me to your colleagues.
Comrade Buljanoff...
Comrade.
Comrade.
Comrade Kopalski...
Comrade Kopalski...
Comrade.
Comrade.
What a charming idea for Moscow to surprise us with a lady comrade.
How much does this cost?
Two thousand francs.
Two thousand francs.
A week?
A week?
A day.
A day.
Do you know how much a cow costs, Comrade Iranoff?
Do you know how much a cow costs, Comrade Iranoff?
A cow?
A cow?
Two thousand francs. If I stay here a week I will cost the Russian people seven cows. Who am I to cost the Russian people seven cows?
Well, it means another two weeks in Paris.
Too bad we have to waste all that time.
Come, now, you must not talk that way.... You have to adjust yourselves.... We must be brave.
Brave... that's right.
Only myself and two other girls. One is a cello player in the opera and the other a street-car conductor.
Just three people in a room this size? Whew!
Bad news?
Look for yourselves.
But Buljanoff, Iranoff, Kopalski...
Now, please, Ninotchka, don't start figuring it out in cows.
Now, please, Ninotchka, don't start figuring it out in cows.
You've done it again and I am responsible. How can you forget yourselves this way? You were sent here to make money, not to spend it.

Buljanoff, she still has those old- fashioned Bolshevik ideas.
...we have a wonderful electric sign: "Dine With Buljanof, Iranoff, and Kopalski."
You mean you are deserting Russia?
Yes, monsieur?
Just looking around.
This is Comrade Kopalski.
Monsieur.
I might be able to accommodate you. Is there some more luggage?
Oh, yes, but have you a safe here big enough to hold this?

I'm afraid we have no boxes of that size in our vault, but there is one suite with a private safe...

But, gentlemen, I am afraid...
A Special Envoy is coming from Moscow. He'll occupy the Royal Suite. Move our things to the smallest room you've got.
Yes, monsieur.
Yes, monsieur.
Right away... instantly!
Now, monsieur, you have no right...
Just a moment. I hope you haven't closed this deal, Monsieur Mercier. It might bring you into serious difficulties.
We may have a chance.
Yes... a very slim one. I want to be fair. I don't deny that you might make out some kind of a case.
Yes... a very slim one. I want to be fair. I don't deny that you might make out some kind of a case.
We haven't anything to discuss with you. We'll talk to a lawyer!
We haven't anything to discuss with you. We'll talk to a lawyer!
All right -- go ahead... you talk to the lawyer and I'll talk to the judge!
How does this strike you? Commissar Razinin, Board of Trade, Moscow. Unexpected situation here. Duchess Swana in Paris claims jewels, and has already brought injunction against sale or removal. After long and careful study we suggest in the interest of our beloved country a fifty-fifty settlement as best solution. Iranoff, Buljanoff, and Kopalski.
If we say that, Leon... we'll be sent to Siberia!
What's new?
Leon, Leonitchka, she is not going to negotiate! She is going to fight that injunction. She's going to make a precedent of it!
Well, boys, I'd like to help you but what can I do? Yesterday I waited six hours in the lobby!
She doesn't leave her room! She has been locked in for the last two days with lawyers and law books!

All right, then make an appointment with her so I can see her!

We can't... but you are so ingenious, Leon...
If we had known we would have greeted you with flowers.
Don't make an issue of my womanhood. We are here for work... all of us. Let's not waste time. Shall we go?
He is a porter. He wants to carry them.
Why?... Why should you carry other people's bags?
Allow me, Comrade.
No, thank you.
What's that?
It's a hat, Comrade, a woman's hat.
I am ashamed to put the picture of Lenin in a room like this. Comrades, your telegram was received with great disfavor in Moscow.
We did our best, Comrade.
We did our best, Comrade.
I hope so for your sake. Let us examine the case. What does the lawyer say?
We dealt directly with the representative of the Grand Duchess. I am sure if we call him he will give you a very clear picture.
I will not repeat your mistake. I will have no dealings with the Grand Duchess nor her representative.
Will you send me some cigarettes, please? Comrades, I am not in a position to pass final judgment but at best you have been careless in your duty to the State. You were entrusted with more than a mere sale of jewelry. Why are we peddling our precious possessions to the world at this time? Our next year's crop is in danger and you
We did it with the best intentions...
We did it with the best intentions...
We cannot feed the Russian people on your intentions. Fifty per cent to a so-called Duchess!... Half of every loaf of bread to our enemy! Comrade Kopalski, go at once to our Embassy and get the address of the best lawyer in Paris.

Yes, Comrade.
Yes, Comrade.
You, Comrade Iranoff, go to the Public Library and get me the section of the Civil Code on property.
I acted on your suggestion and got in touch with the Power and Light authorities. Whenever you want to visit their plants they are open to you.
Oh yes, Power and Light. Thank you.
If there is anything we can do for you...
No, not a thing. Would you like to go out?
How are you, you three scoundrels?
Well, we're back home.
And your own gas cooker? That's marvelous! Naturally it's not the Royal Suite...
Sssh! Once and for all, we're in Moscow!
Sssh! Once and for all, we're in Moscow!
Yes, there's no doubt of that... Just look out of the window and there it is.
Yes, there's no doubt of that... Just look out of the window and there it is.
And it's great! Think what it was a few years ago and what it is now.
The same spring we had in Paris. Just as good.
Even the swallows are back.
Now, comrades... there is something better in life than crumbs of French pastry.
Yes, a good piece of apfel strudel....
Yes, a good piece of apfel strudel....
We will get that... we'll get everything... maybe a little bit later but we'll get it... We must be patient... Finally we got the spring, didn't we? We got the swallows, and you will get your apfel strudel too.
...and Kopalski.
Don't make it difficult for me. This is no more a pleasure trip for me than it is for you.
I'm sorry, gentlemen. The other day I heard such a funny story... It still makes me laugh. It is very funny. I am sorry. Oh yes... about this injunction...
The hearing is set for the twentieth of this month.

Give me another double brandy.
That kind of propaganda is bad anywhere, but inciting the attendants of a powder room to go on strike.... Well, if she succeeds the consequences will be disastrous.

What are you after?

Oh, Ninotchka, who wants to talk business. If you win the suit, fine. If we win the suit, better. You do me an injustice. When we went to my apartment did I have the slightest idea that you had any connection with this deal?

But you have now, and I know now that you are a man who employs business methods which in Russia would be punished by death.

Death! Death! Always so glum! What about life, Ninotchka! Do Russians never think of life? Of the moment in which we are living? The only moment we really have? Don't take it all so seriously, Ninotchka. Nothing is worth it. Please... relax... I beg you, Sergeant... smile!

Will you smile?
Will you smile?
Why?
Why?
Just smile.
Just smile.
At what?
At what?
At anything. At the whole ludicrous spectacle of life. At people being pompous and taking themselves seriously and exaggerating their own importance. If you can't find anything else to laugh at you can laugh at you and me.

Then you should go back to your table.
Then you should go back to your table.
No, I can't leave you. I won't. Not yet. Not until I've made you laugh... at least once.
Ha! Ha! Now go back.
That's not a laugh! I mean a laugh from the heart. Now let's see. I'm going to tell you a funny story. Just a moment... I've got it! Well, it seems there were a couple of Frenchmen who went to America...

Do you like Scotch stories?

I have never heard one.
I have never heard one.
Two Scotchmen met on the street... and I don't know the name of the street and it really doesn't matter. Well, anyway, one's name was McIntosh and the other's was McGillicuddy. McIntosh says to McGillicuddy, "Hello, Mr. McGillicuddy," and McGillicuddy says to McIntosh, "Hello, Mr. McIntosh," and then McIntosh says to McGillicuddy, "How is Mrs. McGillicuddy?" and then McGillicuddy says to McIntosh, "How is

I wish they had never met.
I wish they had never met.
So do I. Now, here's a great one... Ha! Ha! Ha! Well, maybe it's not so good. Let's forget it! How's this? Two men are looking at the moon. One says to the other, "Is it true that a lot of people live on the moon?" "Yes, it is," says the other, "five hundred million." "Whew!" replies the first, "they must get pretty crowded
I suppose you don't think that's funny?
No.
No.
It seemed funny to me when I first heard it. Maybe the trouble isn't with the joke. Maybe it's with you!

I don't think so.
I don't think so.
Maybe you haven't any sense of humor. Well, I'll give you one more chance! Now listen!
Not funny, huh?
No.
No.
So you don't think that's funny? It is funny! Everyone else thinks so! Maybe you didn't get it.
I'll tell you that joke again. A man comes into a restaurant. Did you get that?
Yes.
Yes.
He sits down at the table and says to the waiter... Did you get that too?
He sits down at the table and says to the waiter... Did you get that too?
Yes.
Yes.
Well, so far it isn't funny, but wait. He says to the waiter, "Waiter! Bring me a cup of coffee." So the waiter comes back five minutes later and says, "I'm sorry, sir, we have no coffee."... Wait a minute... wait a minute... I'm all mixed up... A man comes in a restaurant, he sits down, he calls the waiter and he says, "Waiter!
I don't look too foolish?
Foolish? If this dress were to walk down the boulevard all by itself I would follow it from one end of Paris to the other, and when I caught up with it I would say, "Just a moment, you charming little dress, I want you to meet Ninotchka... you two were meant for each other." Ninotchka feels more comfortable.
You remember this room?
I've never been here before. I wonder whom you're thinking of. Oh, I know, a girl with a map, figuring out each step, worrying about north and south. Today... now this might shock you... I went up to a taxi and said "Eight Rue du Bois"... and here I am.

You see I couldn't shout that.
Leon, you know the jokes you told me a few days ago? I wake up in the middle of the night and laugh at them. Now, Leon that's wrong. I know they're not funny, they're silly. They're stupid. And still... I laugh... and when I look at Buljanoff and Iranoff and Kopalski I know they are scoundrels and I should hate them -- then

Leon, I want to tell you something which I thought I never would say, which I thought nobody ever should say, because I thought it didn't exist... and, Leon... I can't say it...
Leon, I would like to ask you something.
Anything, Ninotchka.
Anything, Ninotchka.
If you don't want to answer, you needn't. But if you do, you must tell me the truth.

When I was here before I noticed a photograph of a woman on the desk in a wide silver frame. I thought what a waste of silver. That's all that interested me then. Now I would like to know... what happened to the woman?
She is very attractive. She has great elegance. She's what you call a woman of the world, isn't she?
Ninotchka, I love you.
Ninotchka, I love you.
I suppose she is very entertaining... It must be lots of fun to be with her, so witty, so glamorous...
I suppose she is very entertaining... It must be lots of fun to be with her, so witty, so glamorous...
Ninotchka, you're jealous.
Leon, don't ever ask me for a picture of myself... I couldn't bear the thought of being shut up in a drawer... I couldn't breathe, I couldn't stand it.
My darling.
I wouldn't know. The closest I ever came to champagne was in a newsreel. The wife of some president was throwing it at a battleship.
It's always good luck to launch something with champagne; a battleship... or an evening.
It's funny to look back. I was brought up on goat's milk, I had a ration of vodka in the army, and now champagne.
From goats to grapes. That's drinking in the right direction.
From what I read I thought champagne was a strong drink. It's very delicate. Do people ever get drunk on this?
There have been cases... but the headache the next morning is worth while -- if you drink it with the right toast. To us, Ninotchka!
How do you do?
And General Savitzky.
Quickly, please... tell me one of your funny stories.
A funny story?
A funny story?
You never finished the one about the two Scotchmen with the names.
You never finished the one about the two Scotchmen with the names.
Well, there were two Scotchmen. One was named McIntosh and one was named McGillicuddy. They met on the street.
Go on.
No, darling. I'll tell you another story, a much better one. The only thing that will be over on Thursday is the lawsuit. There will be no Thursday for us. Not next week or any week. We won't let it happen. I'll tear it out of the calendar. Is that a good story?
No, darling. I'll tell you another story, a much better one. The only thing that will be over on Thursday is the lawsuit. There will be no Thursday for us. Not next week or any week. We won't let it happen. I'll tear it out of the calendar. Is that a good story?
Wonderful -- if one could believe it.
Wonderful -- if one could believe it.
You must, darling.
You must, darling.
To the loveliest story I ever heard.
Oo! Darling! Something is the matter.
You just made that trip from goats to grapes a little too fast.

Oh, everything is so wonderful! It's getting farther and farther away!

What, darling?

Thursday.
Thursday.
Yes. Don't worry. Everything will be all right.
Comrades! Comrades!
Darling, darling... please!
Darling, darling... please!
I must talk to my brothers!
I must talk to my brothers!
Shhh! Shhh!
Shhh! Shhh!
Don't shush me. I am People! I want to make a speech. I want to overthrow the Duchess!
But, darling, you can't do that.
Comrades! Good people of France!
Comrades! Good people of France!
Now, Ninotchka... please!
Now, Ninotchka... please!
They are all Duchesses here... thousands of Duchesses... and I am going to tell them.
Quite right... yes, yes, yes, but first you're going in that door and you're going to take a little spirits of ammonia and lie down.
No speech?
No speech?
No speech.
No speech.
I love you, my little Leonitchka!
I love you, my little Leonitchka!
And I adore you, Ninotchua.
Don't tell them where we're going, sweetheart.
No. Nobody will find us.
Are we going to build our little house?
Yes... a little white house.
Yes... a little white house.
Not white, darling.
Not white, darling.
All right, we'll make it red.
All right, we'll make it red.
No, don't let's have it any color... no color... just a house house... let's form our own party.
No, don't let's have it any color... no color... just a house house... let's form our own party.
Right: Lovers of the world unite!

No! No!
No! No!
...and we won't clench our fist...

No! No!
No! No!
Our salute will be a kiss.
Our salute will be a kiss.
Yes... a kiss... salute!
I am so happy. No one can be so happy without being punished. I will be punished and I should be punished. I want to confess, darling.
I know... it's the Russian soul.
I know... it's the Russian soul.
Everyone wants to confess and if they don't confess they make them confess. I am a traitor. When I kissed you I betrayed the Russian ideal. Leon, I should be stood up against the wall.
Would that make you any happier?
Much happier.
Much happier.
All right.
I have paid the penalty. Now let's have some music.
Let's turn on the radio.
Let's turn on the radio.
Radio! What is radio?

It's a little box that you buy on the installment plan and before you tune it in they tell you they have a new model.
It's a little box that you buy on the installment plan and before you tune it in they tell you they have a new model.
Oh yes, yes. It has a little knob that turns... a little knob... it must be somewhere around here... yes... here... I see...
What shall we get? The news!
No, no news. We don't want to know what's happening in the world. We want to be left alone, don't we?
No, no news. We don't want to know what's happening in the world. We want to be left alone, don't we?
Yes, sweetheart... all by ourselves.
Yes, sweetheart... all by ourselves.
Well, then we turn twice to the right and stop at seven...
It's dead.
Well, it has to warm up... you have to give it a chance... just like people... like you and me... first you wanted to fight me and now we belong to the same party... salute!
No music.
No, no music.
There it is... Thursday... you can't rip it out of the week....
But I can throw it out of the window.

Czar Peter gave it to his wife, Catherine the Great. For it he sold ten thousand serfs in the market.
Now, darling, don't get impatient, wait until we are married. You know that worthless butler of mine... that reactionary? Some day when I come home to you I may say, "Darling, I drove Gaston to the market and look what I got from him!"
Come, sweetheart. Let me put it on you. You will teach these jewels. For the first time they will learn how they can look.
They belong to the people.
They belong to the people.
I give them back to the people... I make you Ninotchka the Great... Duchess of the People!... Grand Duchess of the People!
Is this the wish of the masses?
It is their wish.
It is their wish.
Thank you, Leon... thank you, masses. Can I make a speech now?
Thank you, Leon... thank you, masses. Can I make a speech now?
Please.
Comrades! People of the world! The revolution is on the march... I know... wars will wash over us... bombs will fall... all civilization will crumble... but not yet, please... wait, wait... what's the hurry? Let us be happy... give us our moment.... We are happy, aren't we, Leon?
Yes, sweetheart.
Yes, sweetheart.
So happy and so tired.
They wouldn't let me in so I had to get you out.
So -- you're behind all this. I should have known.
Trying to keep me away from you! It couldn't be done. Naturally I couldn't go on forever punching passport officials in the nose -- but I found a way, didn't I? Darling, I had to see you. I wrote and wrote but all my letters came back.
The one I got they wouldn't let me read. It began, "Ninotchka, my darling," and ended, "Yours, Leon."
The one I got they wouldn't let me read. It began, "Ninotchka, my darling," and ended, "Yours, Leon."
I won't tell you what came between... I'll prove it. It will take a long time, Ninotchka... at least a lifetime.
But, Leon, I am only here for a few days.
If you don't stay with me, I'll have to continue my fight. I'll travel wherever Russian commissions are. I'll turn them all into Buljanoffs, Iranoffs, and Kopalskis. The world will be crowded with Russian restaurants. I'll depopulate Russia. Once you saved your country by going back. This time you can save it by staying here.

Well, when it is a choice between my personal interest and the good of my country, how can I waver? No one shall say Ninotchka was a bad Russian.
Hello, Leon!
Good morning, Swana.
It's really a wretched morning... wretched. I can't get myself right. I wanted to look mellow and I look brittle. My face doesn't compose well... all highlights... how can I dim myself down, Leon? Suggest something. I am so bored with this face. I wish I had someone else's face. Whose face would you have if you had your choice? Oh, well, I guess
Your conversation has one marvelous advantage, Swana. However many questions you ask you never expect an answer.

Was it for this that I refused to endorse Dr. Bertrand's Mouthwash? I could have made a little fortune by saying that the Vincent Vacuum Cleaner was the only vacuum cleaner ever used by the Romanoffs... and now you want them to smear my life's secrets over the front page of a tabloid?

Imagine two million clerks and shop girls peeking into my life for a sou! Think of my lovely life being wrapped around cheese and blood sausages! I can see a big grease spot in the midst of my most intimate moments!
My little Volga boatman! Stop threatening! I don't deserve this. Are you my little Volga boatman?
Now, Swana...
Now, Swana...
First tell me, are you my little Volga boatman?
First tell me, are you my little Volga boatman?
Yes, I'm your little Volga boatman.

He's a waiter at the Clarence, poor devil. You know him.
Oh, yes.
Oh, yes.
Tell him I won't be able to see him for a half an hour.
Did I hear something about jewels?
Rakonin, bless him, has given me the most amazing news!
This is the Duchess Swana... I want to speak to Monsieur Cornillon... it's very important... please get him right away... Hello, Monsieur Cornillon? The most incredible thing has happened! My jewels are here in Paris! Three Bolshevik swine are trying to sell them! Yes... yes... we must act immediately!... Call the police... Have them arrested!... Well, then, get an injunction!... But do something, Monsieur
What does he say?
What does he say?
Shhh! ...But how can there be a question?... Are you my lawyer or theirs?... All right, I'll let you know!
What did he say?
It looks pretty hopeless... there may be a chance... that's all... The French Government has recognized Soviet Russia and he doubts that they will risk a war for my poor sake. He might be able to make up some kind of a case but it would cost money, money, money!... That's all they are interested in -- those lawyers!

Huh?

Is anything wrong? Are you ill?

No.
No.

I just couldn't sleep. I got up and went back... and then got up again. These last few days... whew!
Darling, you're taking my business affairs far too seriously. Much as I'd love to rob the Bolsheviks of their filthy money, I won't do it at the expense of your health. Particularly as we know we won't get much. You look so pale... pale but interesting.
Make it ice cold.
Not in your condition. Make it tepid, Gaston... tepid and tender. And lay out his gray suit. Afterwards I'll drive you through the Bois. Slowly... in Waltz time.
Now... here we have two very handsome soft-boiled eggs. Do you suppose hens mind what happens to their eggs? Probably not. They have such unfeeling eyes. We'll put in a great nugget of butter, plenty of pepper and salt... Darling, I haven't seen you for three livelong days... seventy-two hours!
Oh, please, Swana! I don't know whether I'm standing on my head or my heels. Here you are blaming me for neglecting you when I'm trying to concentrate on another woman and can't get near her.
Oh, please, Swana! I don't know whether I'm standing on my head or my heels. Here you are blaming me for neglecting you when I'm trying to concentrate on another woman and can't get near her.
You haven't seen her yet?
You haven't seen her yet?
No, and believe me I've tried everything! I must have telephoned her a hundred times. I've sent her telegrams, I've sent her flowers... I asked her to dinner... I offered her seats for the Opera...
No, and believe me I've tried everything! I must have telephoned her a hundred times. I've sent her telegrams, I've sent her flowers... I asked her to dinner... I offered her seats for the Opera...

Timeless. When she comes into a room you'd think that the Bolsheviks had taken over Paris. She wears her cheap miserable blouse as though it were the latest model by Schiaparelli. What a woman! What a woman! There is a Russian snowstorm in each of her eyes.

Now, darling, soak in your beautiful pine bath and let Gaston shave you.
Thank you.
Is this your new dress suit?
Is this your new dress suit?
Yes, Swana.
Yes, Swana.
Didn't I tell you Benson and Benson were the tailors for you?
Didn't I tell you Benson and Benson were the tailors for you?

Not at all. Your Highness, may I present Madame Yakushova?
How do you do?
I've some wonderful news for you, Leon. It's about Punchy... do you mind if I sit down?
No... please...
He won another blue ribbon and bit the judge. Ha! ha! ha! I bought him the cutest sweater as a reward. You should see him strut down the street in it. He looks like a little boulevardier. You see, Count d'Algout gave me Punchy for my birthday. You must have searched weeks before you found anything as divine as Punchy, didn't you, Leon?
Months, Swana.
Months, Swana.
Poor Madame Yakushova... here we are talking in mysteries.... I'm sure you wonder what it's all about.
There's a charming crowd here tonight, isn't there?
I'm going, Leon... but before I leave I must compliment you on your gown, Madame Yakushova. Is that what they're wearing in Moscow this year?
Will you do me a favor? Stop talking about the good old days.
A very wise suggestion, Leon. I'm afraid madame and I will never agree. The only thing we have in common is our lawsuit and that will be decided next week. I understand everything will be over by Thursday. Am I right?
Leon, darling, how nice! Have you ordered tea or a cocktail?
No thanks, Swana.
No thanks, Swana.
Did I act stupidly last night? Should I apologize?

I'm the one who should apologize. I should have talked to you before.

This time, Swana -- just this once -- I must ask you to listen.

There are a hundred ways to approach it, but I feel it can best be said in one simple phrase. I'm in love, Swana.

And I thought it was something serious! How could you frighten me so?
And I thought it was something serious! How could you frighten me so?
It must be serious, Swana. Not long ago I'd have considered such a statement rather juvenile and rather middle class. Now I can say it without stammering, without a blush. I'm in love, Swana.

Say it over and over again, Leon. Words are a wonderful safety valve, and that's what you need -- because you know it's impossible, don't you?

I have to be simple again, Swana, and you may find it shockingly banal. I've thought it over and I'm willing to take all the consequences, even if it means a complete readjustment of my way of living.

Leon! This has the ugly sound of regeneration.

I'm afraid that's what it is.

The same old trouble, Leon. You're always late. Whether you're taking me to the Opera or calling for me at a beauty shop, you're never on time. And now, when it's a question of your reform -- late again. By about five minutes.

Knowing the efficiency of the French Air Service I think I can guarantee that Madame Yakushova has already taken off for Moscow.

Do you expect me to believe that?
Hello, Leon darling!
Hello.
Hello.
After our talk last night I took it for granted that you would drop in here this morning. Knowing how difficult it is to get into Soviet Russia, I thought I might be of some assistance to you. May I introduce myself? I am the Duchess Swana of Russia... another Russia.
Now, please, Swana.
Count d'Algout was for several years my personal representative and if it is necessary to sign any affidavit for him I'll be delighted.

Just in case they don't give you your visa to Russia I want you to know that I have signed a contract for my memoirs and rented a lovely little château in the Touraine, and if you feel the need of a change...

Thank you, Swana. You are very gracious.
Not at all.... I understand perfectly, Count d'Algout gave you a dog. You made it very clear, madame.
Dear me... I must be losing my finesse. If I'm not careful I'll be understood by everybody.
Isn't it amazing! One gets a wrong impression of the new Russia. It must be charming. I'm glad conditions are so improved. I assume this is what the factory workers wear at their dances?
Exactly. You see, it would have been embarrassing for people of my sort to wear low-cut gowns in the old Russia. The lashes of the Cossacks across our backs were not very becoming, and you know how vain women are.

You're absolutely right about the Cossacks. We made an unpardonable mistake when we let them use their knouts. They had such reliable guns.
You're right, madame, it will all be over by Thursday.
It is unfortunate that you have so few more days in Paris. Be sure and redouble your efforts so that madame can take some pleasant memories when she returns to Moscow. Good night. Good night, Leon.
Good morning.
What?
What?
It is tomorrow morning... tomorrow noon, to be exact. I hope you will forgive me. I know it's extremely cruel to waken anyone at such an hour. Don't you recognize me? I am the Duchess Swana.
I think we can cut your visit short. Leon is not here.
Of course not, my dear! I didn't come here with any such suspicion. How ridiculous! Nor did I come here to pick up his hat.
How stale last night's gaiety looks! It has the taste of a dead cigarette.
If you were encouraged to come here by our meeting last night I am afraid you misunderstood my attitude.

Don't worry, you were quite rude enough. Do you mind if I let in a little fresh air and sunshine? I'm sure it will make you feel better and I want you to be at your very best. In full possession of your faculties, at least.

Don't worry. I have already made reservations. It's perfect flying weather. They assure me there's a fine tail wind which will sweep you back to Moscow in no time.

If this is meant to be a joke it is not funny. Or do you still think you're issuing orders from your palace in Petrograd?
My palace in Petrograd... yes, you took that away from me. You took away my czar, my country, my people, everything I had... but nothing more -- I warn you.
People cannot be taken away, madame, neither a hundred and sixty million nor one. Not if you have their love. You hadn't. That's why you're not in Russia any longer, and that's why you came here this morning.

Very interesting, my dear, but couldn't you write all that from Moscow? A dissertation on love on Soviet stationery -- would be an amusing paradox.

It is not enough to be witty, madame. People grow tired of being entertained. You made that mistake before. Problems were never solved by bowing from a balcony.

My dear, you don't know how impressive I could be. Did you ever see me in my regalia with my diadem and all my jewels?
You can't deny we gave the people their money's worth -- almost -- eight tumbling Romanoffs -- eight!
I must insist that you leave.
I must insist that you leave.
Not before you agree to use those reservations to Moscow.

I wouldn't waken Leon. After last night I would say not before three o'clock at the earliest.
I told you to go, madame.
I told you to go, madame.
Believe me, Leon can't help you. He doesn't know anything about the jewels... I give you my word... I swear it.
Where are they?
You were very careless with our precious jewels, my dear. They're too expensive a toy for two children to play with.

Don't worry. Fortunately last night a very trustworthy friend kept his eyes open. Perhaps he overstepped his function as a waiter but he fulfilled his duty as a Russian. I just put this on for sentiment. The rest are absolutely safe. I assure you. But if you feel like notifying the police...

That's very simple to answer. They were given to me by my mother. They were given to her by her mother, in fact they're mine, you cannot steal what belongs to you!
They always belonged to the Russian people. They were paid for with their sweat, their blood, their lives and you will give them back!
I told you we had plenty to talk about. Shall we sit down?
Now, let's free ourselves from emotionalism and try to solve the problem in a practical way. Our situation has changed considerably. Before I had only a claim to the jewels. Now I have the jewels.
In other words moral ideas have no weight with you... all right, then let's deal with legal facts. You know that France has recognized the Soviet.

My lawyer agrees with you. He says France will uphold it in every court, but I will drag you through every court, don't forget that. And when I say it will take two years I am, as always, conservative.

No, I just wanted to be absolutely impartial. Both of us are faced with two rather uncomfortable years. We can condense these two years to two minutes if you want to accept my proposition. Ninotchka now realizes what she is after.

I think I know Leon quite as well as you... possibly a little better. Leave that worry to me. Five-forty leaves you time enough to close the deal with Monsieur Mercier, but naturally you'll be too busy for any farewells. I'll see to it that everything is done in the most expeditious manner and I will also see you to the airport. That's my

No.
No.
I haven't either, but I've heard about them. You must realize it was only on the strength of your Paris report that I sent them to Constantinople; without that I never would have trusted them on a mission as important as the fur deal.

As soon as our representatives go to a foreign country they seem to lose all sense of balance. If I told you what's going on in Constantinople right now you wouldn't believe it. Those three have been sitting there for six weeks and haven't sold a piece of fur. This anonymous report was sent me. They are dragging the good name of our country
Oh, they shouldn't do such things. Are you sure this report is correct?
It gives details which couldn't be invented. Naturally I want to verify it and that's why I need you.

I appreciate the confidence you show in me, but I must ask you to entrust someone else with this mission. I should hate to interrupt my present work. I am positive that my survey is more important than finding out whether three of our comrades have been drinking some extra glasses of champagne.

This morning three Soviet agents arrived. I overheard a telephone conversation with Mercier, the jeweler. Your Highness, they are going to sell them!
I am sorry... I have to leave.
Thank you so much, my friend. I will get in touch with you.
Sir, the charges are serious -- first, abuse of power; second, obstruction of justice; third, failure to cooperate with Congress; and last, bombing Cambodia ...
They can't impeach me for bombing Cambodia. The President can bomb anybody he wants.
Sir, if I may ... echo my concern ...
Then tell Richardson to fire him.
You're lawyers. How can you let this shit go by! Look! This? Nixon can't say this.
You did say it, sir.
You did say it, sir.
Never. I never said that about Jews!
We could check the tape again, sir.
You don't need to check the tape. I know what I said.
For Christ's sake, it soils my mother's memory. Do you think I want the whole goddamn world to see my mother like this? Raising a dirty mouth!
But sir, we'll have to start over from the beginning. We don't have the staff to ...
Mr. President, I don't know what to say. As soon as we learned from the Secret Service you were en route, the Director was notified. He should be here any minute.
Where the hell is he?

Uh, he's rushing back from his tennis game, sir ...

The bigger problem I see is this guy who was arrested, McCord -- James McCord -- he headed up security for the Committee to Re-Elect. He turns out to be ex-CIA.
"Ex-CIA"? There's no such thing as "ex-CIA," John -- they're all Ivy League Establishment. Is he one of these guys with a beef against us?
So, what about those Watergate clowns, John? This fuck Sirica's crazy. Thirty-five-year sentences! There were no weapons. Right? No injuries. There was no success! It's just ridiculous.
Sirica's just trying to force one of them to testify. But they're solid.

Mr. President, Hunt wants more money. Another hundred-and-thirty thousand.
Son of a bitch.
Son of a bitch.
He says if he doesn't get it right away, he's going to blow us out of the water. And he means it. Ever since his wife died in the plane crash, he's been over the edge.

Executive clemency ...
What?
What?
Hunt has nothing to lose now. Pardon all of them. Nobody's going to investigate a crime for which the criminals have already been pardoned.

Mitchell? Mitchell's ... family.
Either it goes to Mitchell or it comes here.
How much do you need?
Uh, I would say these people are going to cost a million dollars over the next two years ...

We could get that.
We could get that.
Uh huh ...
Uh huh ...
We could get a million dollars. We could get it in cash. I know where it could be gotten.
I'm still not confident we can ride through this. Some people are going to have to go to jail. Hunt's not the only problem. Haldeman let me use the $350,000 cash fund in his safe to make the payments. Ehrlichman had a role, a big role, in the Ellsberg break-in. And I'm ... uh, I think it's time we begin to think in terms

I mean, who the hell cares about this penny-ante shit. Goldwater put it right. He said: "Well for Christ's sake, everybody bugs everybody else; we know that." ... It's the cover-up, not the deed that's really bad here. If only Mitchell could step up and take the brunt of it; give them the hors d'oeuvre and maybe they won't come back for the main
He's right. Maybe it's time to go to the hang-out route, John. A full and thorough investigation ... We've cooperated with the FBI, we'll cooperate with the Senate. What do we have to hide?
No, we have nothing to hide.
No, we have nothing to hide.
We have nothing to hide. But the only flaw in the plan is that they're not going to believe the truth. That is the incredible thing!
You want me to put it all in writing? Over my signature?
Nobody knows more about this thing than you do, John.
I'm not going to be the scapegoat for this. Haldeman and Ehrlichman are in just as deep as me.
John, you don't want to start down that road. I remember what Whittaker Chambers told me back in '48 -- and he was a man who suffered greatly -- he said, "On the road of the informer, it's always night." This is beyond you or even me. It's the country, John. It's the presidency.

I understand that, sir.
I understand that, sir.
Good. You know how I feel about loyalty. I'm not going to let any of my people go to jail. That I promise you. The important thing is to keep this away from Haldeman and Ehrlichman. I'm trusting you to do that, John. I have complete confidence in you.
I was sorry to hear about your wife.
Yes ... I got the money.
Yes ... I got the money.
The President would like to know if that was the last payment.
The President would like to know if that was the last payment.
I'll bet he would.
I'll bet he would.
Is it?
Is it?
In Richard Nixon's long history of underhanded dealings, he has never gotten better value for his money. If I were to open my mouth, all the dominoes would fall.
How the hell do you have the temerity to blackmail the President of the United States?
That's not the question, John. The question is: Why is he paying?
That's not the question, John. The question is: Why is he paying?
To protect his people.
To protect his people.
I'm one of his people. The Cubans are his people. And we're going to jail for him.
I'm one of his people. The Cubans are his people. And we're going to jail for him.
Howard, you'll serve no more than two years, then he'll pardon you.
Howard, you'll serve no more than two years, then he'll pardon you.
John, sooner or later -- sooner, I think -- you are going to learn the lesson that has been learned by everyone who has ever gotten close to Richard Nixon. That he's the darkness reaching out for the darkness. And eventually, it's either you or him. Look at the landscape of his life and you'll see a boneyard.
It was her wrist. And it was through a plate-glass door.
Anyway, they had to take her to Bellevue. Maybe she'll stay this time.
Let's not forget they're just kids, they don't vote.
It's the fall of the Roman Empire, are you blind? And we're putting fig leaves on the statues ...
Yeah ... Sullivan thinks Henry's leaking. He's the one ...
Yeah, I knew it. I knew it from '69 on, and I said it all along, didn't I ...
Who's gonna tell Mitchell?
You do it.
You do it.
Why me?
Why me?
'Cause he hates you. It's worse when you get it from someone you trust.
'Cause he hates you. It's worse when you get it from someone you trust.
He's wrong, you know -- about Kennedy, LBJ, Truman.
He's wrong, you know -- about Kennedy, LBJ, Truman.
How so?
How so?
Sure, they did stuff, but nothing like this, Bob. Forget Watergate, the break-ins, the Enemies list. You got an attempted firebombing at the Brookings Institution, planting McGovern stuff on the guy that shot Wallace, trying to slip LSD to Jack Anderson.

It's a code or something.
I figured that out.

I think he means the Kennedy assassination.

Yeah?
Yeah?
They went after Castro. In some crazy way it got turned on Kennedy. I don't think the "P" knows what happened, but he's afraid to find out. It's got him shitting peach pits.

Christ, we created Frankenstein with those fucking Cubans.
Eight words back in '72 -- "I covered up. I was wrong. I'm sorry" -- and the American public would've forgiven him. But we never opened our mouths, John. We failed him.
Dick Nixon saying "I'm sorry"? That'll be the day. The whole suit of armor'd fall off.
Dick Nixon saying "I'm sorry"? That'll be the day. The whole suit of armor'd fall off.
So you tell Mitchell ...
Colson doesn't know about it; he's pure as a virgin on this one. It's just not clear the burglars knew what they were looking for. They were heading to McGovern's office later that night.
Jesus! Did Mitchell know?
Jesus! Did Mitchell know?
Mitchell's out of his mind now. Martha just put her head through a plate-glass window.
Mitchell's out of his mind now. Martha just put her head through a plate-glass window.
Jesus! Through a window?
Martha's an idiot, she'll do anything to get John's attention. If Mitchell'd been minding the store instead of that nut Martha we wouldn't have that kid Magruder runnin' some third-rate burglary! Was he smoking pot?
Mitchell?
Mitchell?
No! Magruder! That sonofabitch tests my Quaker patience to the breaking point.
McCord? ...
Find out what the hell he was doing at "CREEP." This could be trouble. These CIA guys don't miss a trick. This could be a set-up.
I don't have time for all this shit! Just handle it, Bob! Keep it out of the White House. What else? Kissinger's waiting -- he's gonna throw a tantrum again if I don't see him, threatening to quit ... again.
Well, sir ... it turns out -- one of the people implicated is still, you see, on our White House payroll.
Well, sir ... it turns out -- one of the people implicated is still, you see, on our White House payroll.
Who? Not another goddamn Cuban?
Hunt? Howard Hunt?
He left his White House phone number in his hotel room.
Goddamn! How long have we had this fucking dog?! Two years, he still doesn't come! We need a dog that looks happy when the press is around.
Well, he's photogenic. Let's try dog bones?
I like it. I like the idea.
Is it legal? I mean has anyone ever done it before?
Is it legal? I mean has anyone ever done it before?
Sure. Lyndon, JFK, FDR -- I mean, Truman cut the shit out of my investigation of Hiss back in '48.
Where's Hunt now?
In hiding. He sent Liddy to talk to me.
In hiding. He sent Liddy to talk to me.
And?
And?
He wants money.

Pay him.
Pay him.
Pay him? I told him to get out of the country. It's crazy to start ...
Pay him? I told him to get out of the country. It's crazy to start ...
What the hell are you doing, Ehrlichman? Screwing with the CIA? I don't care how much he wants -- pay him.
It's more than that. It could be more than that. I want Hunt paid.
Uh, we've never done this before, sir ... How do we pay? In ... hundreds? Do you fill a black bag full of unmarked bills?
Uh, we've never done this before, sir ... How do we pay? In ... hundreds? Do you fill a black bag full of unmarked bills?
This is not a joke, John!
This is not a joke, John!
No, sir.
No, sir.
We should set up a Cuban defense fund on this; take care of all of them.
Oh, I suppose you would've just let them take over. These aren't fraternity pranks, John. It's anarchy. A revolution!
I don't know if I'd go that far, sir.
I don't know if I'd go that far, sir.
Why not?
Why not?
Is the war worth it? Is it worth a one-term presidency? Because I think right now that's what we're looking at.
Is the war worth it? Is it worth a one-term presidency? Because I think right now that's what we're looking at.
I will not go down as the first American president to lose a war! Going into Cambodia, bombing Hanoi, bombing Laos -- it buys us time so we can get out and give the South Vietnamese a fighting chance.
Excuse me ... Are you talking about recognizing China, Mr. President? That would cost us our strongest support.
No ... I can do this because I've spent my whole career building anti Communist credentials.
We can't touch Hoover --
I thought the gloves were off.
I thought the gloves were off.
-- as long as he's got secret files on everybody. I don't want 'em used against us. What about the CIA? Helms's done nothing for us. I want to see him.
The soldiers were provoked. The students started it, for Christ's sake!
Sir, there's dead American kids here. Let's say we don't apologize for Kent State, but maybe we could have a national prayer day ...
He's in the dumps, sir. Agnew. Every time you have him attack the press, they give it back to him in spades. He's become the most hated man in America.
Yeah, good old Spiro. Well, better him than me. What the hell is he but an insurance policy?
He's begging for a meeting, chief. He wants to go overseas for awhile.
Well, no place where they speak English. That way he can always say he was misquoted.
The country's loving it.
The hard-core four million "Nixon nuts" aren't gonna go for it ... They'll say I sold out to the Communists.
No, you didn't, Bob.
Looks like he talked to Joe Kraft ... and to the Times. Told them he was dead set against the bombing, that you were ... "unstable." Claims he has to handle you "with kid gloves" ...
I would personally enjoy doing that, sir.
No, no. He's our only "star" right now. He'd go crying straight to the press. He'd crucify us -- the sonofabitch! Get someone from our staff on his ass. Tap his phones. I want to know everyone he talks to.
I end the longest war in American history and they keep harping on this chickenshit! You know who's behind this, don't you -- it's Teddy Kennedy! He drowns a broad in his car and he can't run for president.
He got pretty burned at Chappaquiddick.
He got pretty burned at Chappaquiddick.
My point exactly! Somebody had to die before his shit got in the paper! Fucking Kennedys get away with everything. Do you see me screwing everything that moves? For Christ's sake! I did what the New York Times editorial page said we should do! I ended the war, I got SALT I with the Russians, I opened China! So why are these cocksuckers turning
What about England?
Forget it. Ehrenberg's paid three times that much ...
It'll never wash. Pardoning them means we're guilty. The people, the press will go nuts.
And what am I supposed to do? Just sit here and watch them coming closer? Eating their way to the center? Lyndon bugged! So did Kennedy! FDR cut a deal with Lucky Luciano. Christ, even Ike had a mistress! What's so special about me? What about Lyndon? He could make a couple of calls to the Hill and shut this whole thing down. Did
I don't know, I don't know ... I just know we've made too many enemies.
Sir, Bob and I are gonna have to testify before Earvin's committee.
Sir, Bob and I are gonna have to testify before Earvin's committee.
No, you're not! You're going to claim executive privilege and you're going to stonewall it all the way -- plead the Fifth Amendment. I don't give a shit. They can't force the President's people to testify.
No, you're not! You're going to claim executive privilege and you're going to stonewall it all the way -- plead the Fifth Amendment. I don't give a shit. They can't force the President's people to testify.
Executive privilege will make it look like we're covering up.

We are covering up! For some petty, stupid shit. There are things I can say -- when other people say them, they'd be lies. But when I say them nobody believes me anyway ...
This is June twentieth?
It's marked. Also there's June twenty third. And this year -- March twenty first. Those are the ones ...
Sorry ...
... go on.
... Y'know Al, if Hoover was alive none of this would've happened. He would've protected the President.
Mr. Hoover was a realist.

I trusted Mitchell. It was that damn big mouth wife of his.
I trusted Mitchell. It was that damn big mouth wife of his.
At least Mitchell stood up to it.
At least Mitchell stood up to it.
Not like the others -- Dean, McCord, the rest ... We never got our side of the story out, Al. People've forgotten. I mean: "Fuck you, Mr. President, fuck you Tricia, fuck you Julie!" and all that shit, just words, but what violence! The tear gassing, the riots, burning the draft cards, Black Panthers -- we fixed it, Al, and they hate me for
May I say something, Mr. President?
There's no secrets here, Al.
There's no secrets here, Al.
You've never been a greater example to the country than you are now, sir, but ... but you need to get out more, sir, and talk to the people. No one I know feels ... close to you.
No, sir, you did not.
Damn right. And there's still a helluva lotta people out there who wanna believe ... That's the point, isn't it? They wanna believe in the President.
You're all set, sir. Just push this button. Good night, Mr. President.
You know, Al, men in your profession ... you give 'em a pistol and you leave the room.
You know, Al, men in your profession ... you give 'em a pistol and you leave the room.
I don't have a pistol.
I don't have a pistol.
'Night, Al.
Exactly! We've got to take the war to them. Hit 'em where it hurts -- right in the nuts. More assassinations, more killings. Right, Al?
That's what they're doing.
That's what they're doing.
These State Department jerks, Bill, don't understand; you got to electrify people with bold moves. Bold moves make history, like Teddy Roosevelt -- "T.R." -- rushing up San Juan Hill. Small event but dramatic. People took notice.
It's the President's personal property! I will never give up my tapes to a bunch of Kennedy-loving Harvard Democrat cocksuckers!
This could trigger the impeachment. They'll go to the Supreme Court next.
This could trigger the impeachment. They'll go to the Supreme Court next.

Who the fuck does Cox think he is? I never made a dime from public office! I'm honest. My dad died broke. You know the sonofabitch went to law school with Jack Kennedy? ...

Congress is considering four articles of impeachment, sir.
Congress is considering four articles of impeachment, sir.
For what?!
About a dozen.
A dozen? I got half of 'em elected. I still got the South and Goldwater and his boys. I'll take my chances with the Senate.
Who?
Cox! Fire him.
Cox! Fire him.
But he works for the Attorney General. Only Richardson can fire him.
Richardson won't do that. He'll resign.
The hell he will! Fire him, too. If you have to go all the way down to the janitor at the Justice Department, fire the sonofabitch! And ...
... an action that will at last, once and for all, show that what I knew and what I did with regard to the Watergate break-in and cover-up were just as I have described them to you from the very beginning ...
He's completely lost touch with reality.
He's completely lost touch with reality.
I had no knowledge of the cover-up until John Dean told me about it on March twenty-first. And I did not intend that payment to Hunt or anyone else be made ...
"Victory at Sea," Al ... Henry. The Pacific Theatre. Christ, you can almost feel the waves breaking over the decks.
I'm afraid we have another problem, Mr. President.
June twenty-third, '72, sir. The part that's underlined. Your instructions to Haldeman regarding the CIA and the FBI.
So?
So?
Your lawyers feel it's the ... "smoking gun."

Can we get around this, Al?
Can we get around this, Al?
It's the Supreme Court, sir; you don't get around it.
If you resign, you can keep your tapes as a private citizen ... You can fight them for years.
And if I stay?
The army?
Lincoln used it.
Lincoln used it.
That was civil war.
That was civil war.
How do you see this?
We can't survive this, sir. They also have you instructing Dean to make the payoff to Hunt.
There is nothing in that statement the President can't explain.

It's gone. No one will ever find out what's on it.
... they smelled the blood on me this time, Al. I got soft. You know ... that rusty, metallic smell ...
I know it well, sir.
I know it well, sir.
It came over from Vietnam, you know.
It came over from Vietnam, you know.
Sir?
Sir?
That smell. I mean, everybody suffered so much, their sons killed. They need to sacrifice something, y'know, appease the gods of war -- Mars, Jupiter. I am that blood, General. I am that sacrifice, in the highest place of all ... All leaders must finally be sacrificed.
They did what?! I don't understand. Why'd they go into O'Brien's office in the first place?
Evidently to install bugs and photograph documents.
But O'Brien doesn't even use that office. The Democrats've moved to Miami. There's nothing there!
It was just a fishing expedition. Apparently it was their fourth attempt at the DNC.

Contributions! It was a legal contribution. Who the hell authorized this? Colson?
We feel the bigger concern is Gordon Liddy ...
That fruitcake! What about him?
That fruitcake! What about him?
Well, you know, sir, he's a nut. He used to work here with the "Plumbers" and now he's running this Watergate caper. You remember his plan to firebomb the Brookings using Cubans as firemen? He wanted to buy a damned fire truck! Magruder thinks he's just nutty enough to go off the reservation.

What's Liddy got?
What's Liddy got?
Apparently he was using some campaign cash that was laundered for us through Mexico. The FBI's onto it. We could have a problem with that.
He works for Colson. He used him on the Pentagon Papers. We're trying to figure out when he officially stopped being a White House consultant. After the arrest he dumped his wiretapping stuff into his White House safe.
Howard Hunt is working for the White House? No shit! This is goddamn Disneyland! Since when?
On the list of horribles, I know what he is. And I know what he tracks back to. You say he was involved in the Plumbers?
Definitely. Colson had him trying to break into Bremer's apartment after Bremer shot Wallace, to plant McGovern campaign literature.

I had nothing to do with that. Was he ... in the Ellsberg thing?

Yes, you approved it, sir.

I did?

We were working on China.
Well, why not?
Our own intelligence capability -- to fix the leaks?
Howard Hunt? ... Jesus Christ, you open up that scab ... and you uncover a lot of pus.
What do you mean, sir?
But what are we paying him for?
Silence!
Silence!
But, sir, you're covered -- no one here gave orders to break into the damned Watergate. We're clean. It's only the Ellsberg thing, and if that comes out, it's "national security."

We'll work on it. I say we cut ourselves loose from these clowns and that's all there is to it.
Should we talk to Trini about paying these guys? Or maybe Chotiner?
No, keep Trini out of this. Chotiner's too old. And for God's sake, keep Colson out. It's time to baptize our young counsel. That means Dean can never talk about it. Attorney-client privilege. Get to it. And Dean -- you stay close on this.
Bob, did I approve the Ellsberg thing? You know, I'm glad we tape all these conversations because ... I never approved that break-in at Ellsberg's psychiatrist. Or maybe I approved it after the fact? Someday we've got to start transcribing the tapes.
You approved that before the fact, because I went over it with you. But ...
You approved that before the fact, because I went over it with you. But ...
Uh, no one, of course, is going to see these tapes, but ...
Uh, no one, of course, is going to see these tapes, but ...
That's right, and it's more a problem for Ehrlichman. He fixed Hunt up with the phony CIA ID's, but ... what else does Hunt have on us?
We've got to turn off the FBI. You just go to the CIA, Bob, and tell Helms that Howard Hunt is blackmailing the President. Tell him that Hunt and his Cuban friends know too damn much, and if he goes public, it would be a fiasco for the CIA. He'll know what I'm talking about.
All right.
All right.
Play it tough. That's the way they play it and that's the way we're going to play it. Don't lie to Helms and say there's no involvement, but just say this is sort of a comedy of errors, bizarre, without getting into it. Say the President believes it's going to open up the whole Bay of Pigs thing again. Tell Helms he should call

Yes, sir, but ... do you think Gray'll go for it?

Because the President says it is. My job is to protect this country from its enemies, and its enemies are inside the walls.
I suppose you thought the Presidency was above this sort of thing.
Sir?
Sir?
This isn't a "moral" issue, Bob. We have to keep our enemies at bay or our whole program is gonna go down the tubes.

I'll talk to Helms. Oh, Pat asked if you're coming to the Residence for dinner tonight.
No, no, not tonight. Don't let her in here. I have too much to do.
No, no, not tonight. Don't let her in here. I have too much to do.
Yes, sir. I'll talk to Helms, and, uh ... what's our press position on this Watergate thing? What do I tell Ziegler to tell them?
... When we consider the lineup of the world, we find there are 590 million people on our side, 800 million on the Communist side, and 600 million who are neutral. The odds are 5 to 3 against us ...
He wouldn't do the makeup. Said it was for queers.
I think ... I think ... that's the sort of very dangerous and irresponsible suggestion that ... helping the Cuban exiles who oppose Castro would, uh ... not only be a violation of international law, it would be ...
He's treading water. Don't mention Khrushchev.
He's treading water. Don't mention Khrushchev.
... an open invitation for Mr. Khrushchev to become involved in Latin America. We would lose all our friends in Latin America.
Meanwhile, what happens to the country?
The bastard! If I'd called his shot on Cuba I would've won. He made me look soft.
Where are they?
Dick, you don't have to make a statement. Herb covered it for you.
Dick, you don't have to make a statement. Herb covered it for you.
No!
Cue the crowd. Go to the woman's group. Get the bald guy, he's great ...
I, unlike Senator Kennedy, have a plan to end the war. But not for peace at any price, but peace with honor!
He wasn't protecting me. He was putting me on notice.
What? That he knew Johnny Roselli? Hoover knew a lot of gangsters.
What? That he knew Johnny Roselli? Hoover knew a lot of gangsters.
Yeah, but Roselli wasn't just any gangster. He was the gangster who set up Track 2 in Cuba.
I don't understand. Track 2's Chile?
Chile, Congo, Guatemala, Cuba. Wherever's there's a need for an Executive Action capability, there's a Track 2. In Cuba, Track 1 was the Bay of Pigs invasion. Track 2 ... it was our idea. We felt the invasion wouldn't work unless we got rid of Castro. So we asked ourselves -- who else wants Castro dead? The Mafia, the money people. So we put
The first assassination attempt was in '60, just before the election.
Before?! Eisenhower approved that?
Before?! Eisenhower approved that?
He didn't veto it. I ran the White House side. The mob contact was Johnny Roselli. One of the CIA guys was that jackass, Howard Hunt.
He didn't veto it. I ran the White House side. The mob contact was Johnny Roselli. One of the CIA guys was that jackass, Howard Hunt.
Jesus!
Jesus!
And not just Hunt. Frank Sturgis, all those Cubans. All of them in the Watergate. They were involved in Track 2 in Cuba. Hunt reported to my military aide. But I met with him several times as Vice President. That's what worries the shit out of me. I don't know how much Hunt knows. Or the Cubans.

So? You wanted Castro dead. Everybody wanted Castro dead. If Hunt and the others are CIA, why don't we just throw this back in the CIA's lap? Let Richard Helms take the fall?
So? You wanted Castro dead. Everybody wanted Castro dead. If Hunt and the others are CIA, why don't we just throw this back in the CIA's lap? Let Richard Helms take the fall?
Because ... because Dick Helms knows too much ... If anyone in this country knows more than I do, it's Hoover and Helms! You don't fuck with Dick Helms! Period.
Alright. But why, if Kennedy is so clean in all this, didn't he cancel Track 2?
Because he didn't even know about it. The CIA never told him, they just kept it going. It was like ... it had a life of its own. Like ... a kind of "beast" that doesn't even know it exists. It just eats people when it doesn't need 'em anymore. Two days after the Bay of Pigs, Kennedy called me in. He reamed my
... he'd just found out about Track 2.
You never told him?
You never told him?
I didn't want him to get the credit. He said I'd stabbed him in the back. Called me a two-bit grocery clerk from Whittier.
If they didn't tell Kennedy about Track 2, how did Hoover find out?
They had us bugged. Christ, he had everybody bugged. Yeah, he was gonna support me in '68, but he was also threatening me. That was Hoover: he'd give you the carrot, but he'd make damn sure the stick went right up your ass.
Well, one way or the other, Kent State is not good. We have to get out in front of this thing. The PR is going to murder us.
Money. Follow the money.
Money. Follow the money.
Sir?
Sir?
These kids are being manipulated by the Communists. Like Chambers and Hiss.
... never complain, never explain, John ...
I tell you, the soldiers were provoked. Now stop this pussyfooting around. Dead kids! How the hell did we ever give the Democrats a weapon like this? I mean, if Cambodia doesn't work, we'll bomb Hanoi if we have to.
... and we've got the economic guys at five. The Dow lost another 16 points. They're going to want a decision on the budget. Sir? ... Are we holding the line on a balanced budget?
No ... a little deficit won't hurt. Jesus, they're serious. Why're we stopping?
No ... a little deficit won't hurt. Jesus, they're serious. Why're we stopping?
Run 'em over.
Get that little fucker! Great tackle! Reminds me of my days at Whittier. Most of these kids are useless.
Probably flunking, nothing to do except come down here and meet girls. Henry's out there with them.

Don't forget the South, sir, the West. Filled with the good football colleges, straight kids. There's more of 'em with you than against you. Not like these mudmutts.

It's the parents' fault really.
But, hell, this is nothing compared to Venezuela. When I was Vice President, Ike sent me down there like a blocking back. They threw rocks, broke out our windows, almost overturned the car. Read Six Crises, Bob. Boy, Pat was brave!
Yeah, we've got to get our vice president off the golf course and back there on the college circuit. That's top priority.
Mr. President!
It's okay, Bob, we're just rapping, my friends and I. We actually agree on a lot of things ...
We really must go, Mr. President.
Don't forget, the most important thing in your life is your relationship with your Maker ... Don't forget to be on God's side.
She got it, Bob. A nineteen-year-old college kid ...
What?
What?
She understood something it's taken me twenty-five fucking years in politics to understand. The CIA, the Mafia, the Wall Street bastards ...
She understood something it's taken me twenty-five fucking years in politics to understand. The CIA, the Mafia, the Wall Street bastards ...

And his staff. Come on, the copy they were filing from China was great.
Wait till the Mai-tais wear off.
The Jews aren't the middle, Henry. They're the far left.
You're talking too much about black Africa, Henry. It's killing us with the rednecks.
You're talking too much about black Africa, Henry. It's killing us with the rednecks.
The blacks are lost, the "schwartzes" are gone ...

Don't let it lose us the right-wing vote ...
Gentlemen, I think it's about time for us to be getting to the airport.
Let him finish, Bob.
You know, they all miss the point. Probably our biggest achievement as an administration, when it's all said and done, isn't China or Russia. It's pulling out of Vietnam without a right wing revolt.
I believe you're right, boss.
I believe you're right, boss.
... but even the presidency isn't enough anymore ...
... but even the presidency isn't enough anymore ...
Sir?
Sir?
The presidency won't protect us, Bob. We're beyond politics now ...
Congratulations, boss. A great victory! The madman theory wasn't so crazy after all.
This could be it ... this could be it. Four long years ...
So that explains his press notices. Working both sides of the fence: Jewboy Henry, always trying to get his Nobel Prize, get laid ...
My God, my God! He talked to the New York Times?
My God, my God! He talked to the New York Times?
We ought to fire his whining ass. Right now when he's on top. You know what -- it'll set the right example for the rest of this administration.
Because they're not Americans.
Right. They don't trust! They don't trust America!
Right. They don't trust! They don't trust America!
Why would they?! Who the hell's Sulzberger anyway? Their parents are gold traders from Eastern Europe. They buy things. They come to Jew York City and they buy up things. One of the things they buy is the New York Times. And you know what? Be proud because they'll never trust you, sir, because we speak for the average American.
You know why they're turning on me? They're not serious about power, that's why. They're playing with power. They're forgetting the national interest. In the old days, people knew how to hold power, how to set limits. They wouldn't have torn this country apart over a third-rate burglary. All they care about now are their egos, looking good at cocktail parties ...
... beating out the other papers, chasing girls ...
... beating out the other papers, chasing girls ...
... worrying whether someone said something "nice" about them. All short-term, frivolous bullshit; Ben Bradlee worrying about Teddy Kennedy liking him ...
You played it perfectly, sir -- cocksucker! He's going to think twice before he leaks again.
He'll be looking in his toilet bowl every time he pulls the chain.
We've got to turn the faucet off on this thing. It's out of control ... You might burden just me with this in the future.
It's Helms -- it's got to be.
It's Helms -- it's got to be.
We could leverage Helms.
We could leverage Helms.
How?
How?
When I met with him, he said ...
... I was wondering what's such dynamite in this Bay of Pigs story? ... although it was clearly effective, because all of a sudden it was no problem for Helms to go to the FBI and try to put a lid on Watergate.
What about the documents he promised?
What about the documents he promised?
He'll give us the documents. But I think he should be offered the ambassadorship to Iran. Then he'll go without a whimper.
I promised Iran to Townsend.
Put Townsend in Belgium; it's available.
Put Townsend in Belgium; it's available.
Townsend gave us 300 grand. Belgium's not worth more than 100, 150 ...
Helms wants Iran or there might be problems. All of his old CIA buddies are over there making a fortune off the Shah.
For God's sake, when does this end?!
More light, chief?
No ...
... There can be no whitewash at the White House ... two wrongs do not make a right. I love America. God bless America and God bless each and every one of you.
Sir ... six bodies.
Richard ... come with me, would you ...
Why me?
Because Harold tests thy father's will is no reason to admire him. Let Harold's worldliness be a warning to thee, not an example.
Yes, Mother ...
Yes, Mother ...
Harold may have lost touch with his Bible, but thou must never lapse.
Do not tell a lie, Richard ... The cornsilk cigarette Harold gave thee behind the store this morning.
I don't ... have them. Mother ... I swear, I ... didn't smoke.
I don't ... have them. Mother ... I swear, I ... didn't smoke.
I see ... Well then, Richard, we have nothing more to talk about, do we?

Please, Mother, it ... it was just one time, Mother, I'm ... I'm sorry.

So am I. Thy father will have to know of thy lying.

No, no! Please, don't. Don't tell him. I'll never do it again. I promise. I promise ... Please, mama ...
No, no! Please, don't. Don't tell him. I'll never do it again. I promise. I promise ... Please, mama ...
I expect more from thee, Richard.
Please! I'll never let you down again, Mother. Never. I promise.
Then this shall be our little secret. Remember that I see into thy soul as God sees. Thou may fool the world. Even thy father. But not me, Richard. Never me.
Then this shall be our little secret. Remember that I see into thy soul as God sees. Thou may fool the world. Even thy father. But not me, Richard. Never me.
Mother, think of me always as your faithful dog ...
We haven't said grace yet. Richard.
Is it my turn?
I can't ...
Thou must.
It's a gift, Richard. This law school is a gift from your brother.
Did he have to die for me to get it?!
Did he have to die for me to get it?!
It's meant to make us stronger. Thou art stronger than Harold ... stronger than Arthur. God has chosen thee to survive ...

What about happiness, Mother?

Thou must find thy peace at the center, Richard. Strength in this life. Happiness in the next.
What'd he say?
What do you think? He said in life there's no free ride.
What do you think? He said in life there's no free ride.
What'd you say?
What'd you say?
I said I didn't need a free ride. I need a suit.
Oh, no, Harold. He doesn't respond well to humor. Maybe if you talk to Mother she can ...
I'd rather get a whipping than have another talk with her. Anything but a talk with her.
Hey ... you'll be able to do it now.
What ... ?
What ... ?
Go to law school. Mom and Dad'll be able to afford it now ...
Mom expects great things from you ...
Harold ... can I get you anything?
Relax, Dick, it's just me ... The desert's so beautiful, isn't it? I want to go home, Dick. Time to go home.
You're not gonna quit on me, are you, Harold?
I'm honored, Dick, that you've come all this way out here to Virginia to visit us at last.
My friends call me "Mister President."
My friends call me "Mister President."
And so shall I. Arrange some coffee, would you General Cushman?
Robert Cushman is a lieutenant general in the Marine Corps, the Deputy Director of the CIA ... and this is what you use him for?
I didn't choose him as my deputy, Mr. President. You did.
I suppose, "Mister President," you're unhappy that we have not implemented your Domestic Intelligence plan, but ...
You're correct. I'm concerned these students are being funded by foreign interests, whether they know it or not. The FBI is worthless in this area. I want your full concentration on this matter ...

I'm sure you realize this is a very tricky area, Mr. President, given our charter and the congressional oversight committees ...
Screw congressional oversight. I know damn well, going back to the '50's, this agency reports what it wants, and buries what it doesn't want Congress to know. Pay close attention to this.
Is there something else that's bothering you, Mr. President?
Yes ... It involves some old and forgotten papers. Things I signed as Vice President. I want the originals in my office and I don't want copies anywhere else.
You're referring, of course, to chairing the Special Operations Group as Vice President.
Yes ...
Diem? Trujillo? Lumumba? Guatemala? Cuba? ... It's a shame you didn't take similar precautions, Dick.
I'm interested in the documents that put your people together with ... the others. All of them ...
President Kennedy threatened to smash the CIA into a thousand pieces. You could do the same ...
I'm not Jack Kennedy. Your agency is secure.
I'm not Jack Kennedy. Your agency is secure.

I promised the American people peace with honor in Southeast Asia. That could take time -- two, maybe three years ... In the meantime, your agency will continue at current levels of funding.

The President would support a reasonable request for an increase.
And me? ...
Firing you, Mr. Helms, wouldn't do any good. Of course you'll continue as DCI. You're doing a magnificent job.

It will take a little time, but I'll order a search for your papers. Though it does raise a disturbing issue.

Well, we'll lodge a formal protest.

I don't think we can treat this as a formality. Mr. Kennedy made a verbal promise to the Russians not to invade Cuba. But you authorized Dr. Kissinger to put this in writing.
Are you tapping Kissinger?

Is that why you and Kissinger are negotiating with the Chinese?
This is an extremely dangerous direction, Mr. President. Terrible consequences can result from such enormous errors in judgement.
But ... if we were able to separate China from Russia once and for all, we can -- we could create a balance of power that would secure the peace into the next century.

So President Kennedy thought.
I never thought Jack was ready for the presidency. But I would never, never consider ... His death was awful, an awful thing for this country. Do you ever think of death, Mr. Helms?
Flowers are continual reminders of our mortality. Do you appreciate flowers?
Flowers are continual reminders of our mortality. Do you appreciate flowers?
No. They make me sick. They smell like death ... I had two brothers die young. But let me tell you, there are worse things than death. There is such a thing as evil.

But it ends so beautifully ominous
What do you think this plan is, Edgar? A nuclear attack?
He's lying, Clyde. Always has. That's why Nixon's always been useful. Hold still. And take your hand off your hip.

Would you walk with me down to the paddock? I'd like to look at the horses for the eighth.
Ummm...
If things remain as they are ... He's got the anti-war vote.

Turn this crap off, Clyde. It's giving me a headache ... You may go, Joaquin.
Thank you for coming, Dick.
Winning?
Winning?
Actually, I've just had a bit of luck.
Oh, my goodness ...
How about you? Are you going to win?
How about you? Are you going to win?
You should ask Bobby.
Can't we just talk here? I've got the police chiefs in San Diego.
I'm trying to spare you an embarrassment. Johnny Roselli is on his way back here.

Yes. Your old friend from Cuba.

I never met the man.

I know you've been very careful not to. That's why I'm concerned.
You'll win the nomination.
It could be '60 all over again, Edgar. Bobby's got the magic, like a goddamn rock star. They climb all over each other just to touch his clothes! He'll ride his brother's corpse right into the White House.
Or he'll steal it like his brother. He's a mean little sonofabitch, Edgar ... He had the IRS audit my mother when she was dying in a nursing home.
I know ...
Yeah, well, as I said, Edgar ...
You asked if you could count on my support ... As long as I can count on yours.
You asked if you could count on my support ... As long as I can count on yours.
The old queen did it on purpose.
There must be a quarter-million out there, Edgar. They've been at it now for a year. Young kids just like Tricia. I don't know. Do you think they have a point, Edgar? Maybe this whole damned system of government is ...
Remember what Lenin said in 1917, Mr. President: "The power was lying in the streets just waiting for someone to pick it up." The Communists have never been closer. Now is the time to go back to the old themes, the ones that made you president. Let the Communists know you're onto them.

Don't listen to 'em, don't quit. Remember - Kennedy, Bobby, and King were against the war. Where are they now? Don't give 'em a goddamn inch on the war. President Johnson bombed Laos for years and nobody knew or said a thing. How the hell the Times ever got ahold of this Ellsberg stuff is a disgrace!

Yeah, you do. I'd be bugging myself, Edgar ... Who'd get the tapes?
No one. Your property. It would prove your case. Why do you think Kissinger's taping your calls? For history. His word against yours -- and right now he's got the records.
This damned tie ... Will you help me, Edgar? Churchill used to say to me, "If you want your own history written properly, you must write it yourself." All right, Edgar, but just don't let it come back to haunt me.
It won't. As long as I'm here.

Well, uh, Trini and I have an early plane. We were hoping to get back to New York in time for ...
Like you said Jack, I'm just a New York lawyer now.
We'll see about that.
I know for a fact that the one with the big tits is a Republican, and she'd do anything for the Party.
She's quite pretty.
She's quite pretty.
Her name's Sandy ...
By the way, Jack, this looks like a pretty straight-forward transaction to me, but we should get into it soon -- just take a few minutes, maybe up at the house ...
He's all business, ain't he, Trini? Dick, we could've had our own goddamn lawyers handle this deal. We brought you down here 'cause we wanted to talk to you ...
Hell, Kennedy's pissed Cuba away to the Russians. And he don't know what the hell he's doing in Vietnam. These are dangerous times, Dick, especially for business ...
Agreed.
Gentlemen, I tried. I told Kennedy to go into Cuba. He heard me and he made his decision. I appreciate your sentiments. I've heard them from many fine Cuban patriots, but it's nothing I can do anything about. Now, it's a long drive back to Dallas tonight, and Trini and I have got an early flight tomorrow to New York ...
Dick, these boys want you to run. They're serious. They can deliver the South and they can put Texas in your column. That would've done it in '60.

Well, you sure been chock full of surprises so far, "Mister President."
It looks like to me we're gonna lose the war for the first goddamned time and, Dick, goddamn it, you're going along with it, buying into this Kissinger bullshit -- "detente" with the Communists. "Detente" -- it sounds like two fags dancing.
Jack, we're not living in the same country you and I knew in '46. Our people are just not gonna sacrifice in major numbers for war. We can't even get 'em to accept cuts in their gas tanks. Hell, the Arabs and the Japanese are bleeding the shit out of our gold ..

What do you mean, Jack?
What do you mean, Jack?
I mean I got federal price controls on my oil. The ragheads are beating the shit out of me. And I got your EPA environment agency with its thumb so far up my ass it's scratching my ear.
... And now I have a federal judge ordering me to bus my kids halfway 'cross town to go to school with some nigger kids. I think, Mr. President, you're forgetting who put you where you are.
The American people put me where I am.
Because if you're uncomfortable with the EPA up your ass, try the IRS ...
Well, goddamn. Are you threatening me, Dick?

Presidents don't threaten. They don't have to. Good day, gentlemen.
Mr. President, we are in a revolutionary situation. We are under siege -- Black Panthers, Weathermen; The State Department under Rogers is leaking like a sieve. And now this insignificant little shit Ellsberg publishing all the diplomatic secrets of this country will destroy our ability to conduct foreign policy.
Here, Tim ... Tim. I'm as frustrated as you, Henry, but don't you think this one's a Democrat problem. They started the war; it makes them look bad.
Fuck it! He doesn't like me, John! It's your fault, Henry.
I beg your pardon --
I beg your pardon --
It's your people who are leaking to the Times. Wasn't this Ellsberg a student of yours at Harvard? He was your idea; why are you suddenly running for cover?
It's your people who are leaking to the Times. Wasn't this Ellsberg a student of yours at Harvard? He was your idea; why are you suddenly running for cover?
He was, he was. We taught a class together at Harvard. But you know these back-stabbing Ivy League intellectuals, they can't ...
He was, he was. We taught a class together at Harvard. But you know these back-stabbing Ivy League intellectuals, they can't ...
No, Henry. I don't.
No, Henry. I don't.
He's turned into a drug fiend, he shot people from helicopters in Vietnam, he has sexual relations with his wife in front of their children. He sees a shrink in L.A. He's all fucked up. Now he's trying to be a hero to the liberals ... If he gets away with it, everybody will follow his lead. He must be stopped at all costs.
Who are you talking to like this, you insignificant shit ...
... and what do we get for it? Gobs and gobs of bullshit, gossip, nothing! Someone is leaking. We've got to stop the leaks, Henry, at any cost, do you hear me? Then we can go for the big play -- China, Russia.
Alright, Henry -- we're gonna go your way. Crush this Ellsberg character the same way we did Hiss!
There's no other choice.
There's no other choice.
We're gonna hit him so hard he looks like everything that's sick and evil about the Eastern Establishment. You and your "plumbers" are gonna find dirt on this guy -- let's see him going to the bathroom in front of the American public! And when we finish with him, they'll crucify him!
... as the old alliances crumble.
Finally someone who's noticed! I'm a great admirer of yours, too, Mr. Nixon. You are an unusual politician. We share a mutual idol -- "Six Crises" sounds like a page from Churchill.

Churchill, DeGaulle, Disraeli. They all went through the pain of losing power.
Churchill, DeGaulle, Disraeli. They all went through the pain of losing power.
But they all got it back again, didn't they? We should have lunch sometime.
Well, as you know, most of my staff have weighed in against this "incursion." They believe it will fail to achieve anything fundamental militarily, and will result in crushing criticism domestically ...
I didn't ask what your staff thinks, Henry. What do you think?
I didn't ask what your staff thinks, Henry. What do you think?
What I think is ... they're cowards. Their opposition represents the cowardice of the Eastern Establishment. They don't realize as you do, Mr. President, that the Communists only respect strength, and they will only negotiate in good faith if they fear the "madman," Richard Nixon.
Exactly, sir. That is your historical contribution: to lead boldly in an era of limits.
No one understands! -- even my own men. What do you think the Communists respond to? Honesty, liberal guilt, soul-wringing crap, fathers on TV crying? Hell no! I understand the Communist mind, I've studied it for thirty years. They grasp "realpolitik" better than any of us, right, Henry?
That's triangular diplomacy, gentlemen.
Exactly, yes, Mr. President. That is my contention.
Exactly, yes, Mr. President. That is my contention.
That's what geopolitics is about -- the whole world linked by self interest ... You tell me, Ron, how the hell I can explain that on television to a bunch of simple-minded reporters and weeping fucking mothers!
This will get me a second term. Damn it, without risk, there's no heroism. There's no history. I, Nixon, was born to do this.
Mr. President, this cannot be breathed! Especially to our secretary of state -- that cretin Rogers ... The Chinese would never trust us again. The only way, I emphasize only way, to pull this off is in secret.
Mr. President, this cannot be breathed! Especially to our secretary of state -- that cretin Rogers ... The Chinese would never trust us again. The only way, I emphasize only way, to pull this off is in secret.
This is a major coup, gentlemen -- our own State Department doesn't even know. And if it leaks out of here tonight ...
That's right! And if necessary, I'll drop the big one.
We have to entertain the possibility ...
You'll pick up the middle on this one - the Jews and Negros.
Jews and Negros don't win elections, Henry. Better to hang them around the Democrats' necks.
Housecleaning? It would be ugly, Henry, really ugly ...
But it must be done; your government is paralyzed.
But it must be done; your government is paralyzed.
All kinds of shit would come out. Like the Ellsberg thing. You knew about that, Henry, didn't you?
All kinds of shit would come out. Like the Ellsberg thing. You knew about that, Henry, didn't you?
I ... I heard something ... It sounded idiotic.
I ... I heard something ... It sounded idiotic.
Idiotic? Yes, I suppose it was.
That doesn't matter now, Henry. The point is, you might lose some of your media-darling halo if the press starts sniffing around our dirty laundry.
I had nothing to do with that, sir, and I resent any implication ...
I had nothing to do with that, sir, and I resent any implication ...
Resent it all you want, Henry, but you're in it with the rest of us. Cambodia, Ellsberg, the wiretaps you put in. The President wants you to know you can't just click your heels and head back to Harvard Yard. It's your ass too, Henry, and it's in the wind twisting with everyone else's.
Mr. Nixon, it is possible for even a president to go too far.
Yeah ...
Can you imagine what this man would have been had he ever been loved?
... because people have got to know whether or not their President is a crook. Well, I am not a crook. I have never made a dime from public service ...
... because people have got to know whether or not their President is a crook. Well, I am not a crook. I have never made a dime from public service ...
Oh God, I'm going to throw up.
Yes, you always had a good sense of timing, Henry. When to give and when to take. How do you think Mao, Brezhnev will react? Do you think this is how they'll remember me, Henry, after all the great things you and I did together? As some kind of ... of ... crooks?
They will understand, sir. To be undone by a third-rate burglary is a fate of biblical proportions. History will treat you far more kindly than your contemporaries.
They will understand, sir. To be undone by a third-rate burglary is a fate of biblical proportions. History will treat you far more kindly than your contemporaries.
That depends who writes the history books. I'm not a quitter ... but I'm not stupid either ... A trial would kill me -- that's what they want. But they won't get it.
If they harass you, I, too, will resign. And I will tell the world why.
Don't be stupid. The world needs you, Henry; you always saw the big picture. You were my equal in many ways. You're the only friend I've got, Henry.
Don't be stupid. The world needs you, Henry; you always saw the big picture. You were my equal in many ways. You're the only friend I've got, Henry.
You have many friends ... and admirers ...

Do you ever pray? You know ... believe in a Supreme Being?
Do you ever pray? You know ... believe in a Supreme Being?
Uh ... not really. You mean on my knees?
Uh ... not really. You mean on my knees?
Yes. My mother used to pray ... a lot. It's been a long time since I really prayed. Let's pray, Henry; let's pray a little.
... Uh, I hope this doesn't embarrass you.
Not at all. This is not going to leak, is it?
Not at all. This is not going to leak, is it?
Don't be too proud; never be too proud to go on your knees before God.
You know, Mr. Chairman, at Harvard I used your writings in my class.
What a waste of time. My writings mean absolutely nothing.
What a waste of time. My writings mean absolutely nothing.
But your writings have changed the world, Mr. Chairman.

Fung pi! I've only managed to change a few things around the city of Beijing. I want to know your secret.

Secret, Mr. Chairman?
Secret, Mr. Chairman?
How a fat man gets so many girls.
I was asleep, Mr. President. What can I get you?
Just ... uh ... you know.
Just ... uh ... you know.
Of course.
Do you miss Cuba, Manolo?
Yes, Mr. President.
Yes, Mr. President.
We let you down, didn't we. Your people.
We let you down, didn't we. Your people.
That was Mr. Kennedy.
That was Mr. Kennedy.
You don't think he was a hero?
He was a politician.
Did you cry when he died?

Yes.
Yes.
Why?
Why?
I don't know. He made me see the stars ...
I don't know. He made me see the stars ...
How did he do that? All those kids ... Why do they hate me so much?
I must say you look very good, Mr. Chairman.
Looks can be deceiving ...
Looks can be deceiving ...
We know you've taken a great risk in inviting us here.
Don't ever trust them. They never tell the truth or honor their commitments. Vietnamese are like Russians. Both are dogs.
Mr. Chairman, there is an old saying: The enemy of my enemy is my friend.
Mr. Chairman, there is an old saying: The enemy of my enemy is my friend.
That has the added virtue of being true.
You know, I voted for you in your last election.
I was the lesser of two evils.
You're too modest, Nixon. You're as evil as I am. We're both from poor families. But others pay to feed the hunger in us. In my case, millions of reactionaries. In your case, millions of Vietnamese.
Civil war is always the cruelest kind of war.
Civil war is always the cruelest kind of war.
The real war is in us. History is a symptom of our disease.
Yes, well ... Gentlemen, I promised my wife. I'm out of politics.
You just came down here for the weather, right, Mr. Nixon?
You just came down here for the weather, right, Mr. Nixon?
I came down here to close a deal for Studebaker.
So ... how's the food over there in China, Mr. Nixon?
Free, if you're the president.
What are you going to do about this Allende fellow nationalizing our businesses in Chile? You gonna send Kissinger down there?
We're gonna get rid of him -- Allende, I mean -- just as fast as we can. He's on the top of the list.
We're gonna get rid of him -- Allende, I mean -- just as fast as we can. He's on the top of the list.
How about Kissinger along with him?
How about Kissinger along with him?
Kissinger's misunderstood. He pretends to be a liberal for his Establishment friends, but he's even tougher than I am ...
We can prosecute the New York Times, go for an injunction ...
... but it's not, bottom-line, gonna change a goddamn thing, John. The question is: How do we screw Ellsberg so bad it puts the fear of God into all leakers?
It was illegal, what he did.
You know, this kinda thing, you gotta be brutal. A leak happens, the whole damn place should be fired. Really. You do it like the Germans in World War II. If they went through these towns and a sniper hit one of them, they'd line the whole goddamned town up and say: "Until you talk you're all getting shot." I really think that's what
The lie?
You remember, John, in '48 -- no one believed Alger Hiss was a communist. Except me. They loved Hiss just like they loved this Ellsberg character. East Coast, Ivy League. He was their kind. I was dirt to them. Nothing.
And Dick beat the shit out of them.
But I wouldn't have if Hiss hadn't lied about knowing Chambers. The documents were old and out of date, like these Pentagon Papers. The key thing we proved was that Hiss was a liar. Then people bought it that he was a spy. It's the lie that gets you.

Hiss was protecting his wife. I've always believed that.
Hiss was protecting his wife. I've always believed that.
When they know you've got something to protect, that's when they fuck you!
Sorry, Dick. She's a little tipsy.
You mean smashed! She called up at midnight last week. Talking a bunch of crap. Pat can't stand her.
You mean smashed! She called up at midnight last week. Talking a bunch of crap. Pat can't stand her.
It's a thing she does. She talks at night.
It's a thing she does. She talks at night.
Talks all day, too! How the hell can you put up with her, John?
Talks all day, too! How the hell can you put up with her, John?
What the hell -- I love her. And she's great in bed.
Rocky's full of shit! No way he's going to get nominated west of the Hudson with a new wife. He's gonna be drinking Scotches in retirement at some goddamn country club with the rest of the Republicans.

That'll be the day.
That'll be the day.
Let's get out of here; it's too painful. I hate it. We went bowling last weekend. Next weekend we're going to the zoo. Whoever said there was life after politics was full of shit.

Make some money, Dick, prove yourself to the Wall Street crowd and let Goldwater and Rockefeller take the fall against Kennedy.
Uh, wait ...
You need her, Dick -- in '60 she was worth five, six million votes.
You need her, Dick -- in '60 she was worth five, six million votes.
Don't worry -- I'll use the old Nixon charm on her.
How many?
Four. Two boys. Two girls. And eight wounded.

One of the fathers was on the TV saying, "My child was not a bum." And it's playing like gangbusters. Hell, Hoover told me one of the girls was a nymph.

Shit, the press doesn't care about the facts. Cronkite's sticking it to me. It's their first big hit on Richard Nixon.
This isn't '48, Dick. They'll never buy it.
How do you know that, John? Did we try? Are we just giving up like the rest of 'em? What's Hoover found, for God's sake?
You all right?
My brother Harold was about the same age as those kids, John. Tuberculosis got him.

They were throwing rocks, John, just rocks. They don't think I feel ... but I feel too much sometimes. I just can't let a whole policy get dominated by our sentimentality.

It broke my heart when Harold died.
It broke my heart when Harold died.
That was a long time ago.
Get off that. That leads nowhere. You should offer condolences to the families of those kids.
Sure, I'd like to offer condolences.
... give me a break, Mary.
You all know me. I'm one of you, I grew up a stone's throw from here on a little lemon ranch in Yorba Linda ...
But it was all we had.
... but it was all we had.
Edgar, wonderful to see you. Clyde ... hi.
Mr. Nixon.
... Somebody should shoot the little bastard.
I wanna fight just as dirty as he does.
I wanna fight just as dirty as he does.
... Use his women.
... Use his women.
... Any information you have, Edgar. The sonofabitch is not gonna steal from me again! Can you back me up on this? Can I count on your support?
Hi, I'm Dick Nixon.
You're shittin' me.
You're shittin' me.
Where you from?
Where you from?
Syracuse.

Ernie Davis.
Ernie Davis.
Right, right. I used to play a little ball myself at Whittier. Of course, they used me as a tackling dummy.
What you have to understand, Mr. Nixon, is that we are willing to die for what we believe in.
That man up there lived in similar times. He had chaos and civil war and hatred between the races ... Sometimes I go to the Lincoln Room at the White House and just pray. You know, the liberals act like idealism belongs to them, but it's not true. My family went Republican because Lincoln freed the slaves. My grandmother was an abolitionist. It was
Come on, man -- Vietnam ain't Germany. It doesn't threaten us. It's a civil war between the Vietnamese.
But change always comes slowly. I've withdrawn more than half the troops. I'm trying to cut the military budget for the first time in thirty years. I want an all-volunteer army. But it's also a question of American credibility, our position in the world ...
Hi.
Hello ...
That's Julie ... and that's Tricia. She, uh, reminds me a little bit of you ...
Oh yeah ... she really is ... wholesome.
... I don't really know you yet, Sandy ... What do you like? I mean, what kind of clothes do you like? Do you like blue ... red?
Oh, I like satin, I like pink ...
Oh, I like satin, I like pink ...
What kind of, uh ... music do you like?

I like jazz ...
I like jazz ...
Yeah ... Guy Lombardo ...
Yeah ... Guy Lombardo ...
Elvis I like, too.
Elvis I like, too.
Oh yeah, he's good.
... but it depends on what I'm doing to the music, Dick ...
Uh, is your mother ... still alive?
Uh, is your mother ... still alive?
Yeah, she lives in Dallas ...
Yeah, she lives in Dallas ...
She must be very attractive. Would she like an autograph? She might remember me ... Where's Trini?
We didn't come here to talk about football. We came here to end the war.
Yes, I understand that.
No, we don't! You're full of shit! You say you want to end the war, so why don't you? My brother died over there last November. Why? What good was his death?
I know. I know. I've seen a lot of kids die, too, in World War II.
Someone wants it ... You can't stop it, can you? Even if you wanted to. Because it's not you. It's the system. And the system won't let you stop it ...
There's a lot more at stake here than what you want. Or even what I want ...
There's a lot more at stake here than what you want. Or even what I want ...
Then what's the point? What's the point of being president? You're powerless.
No, no. I'm not powerless. Because ... because I understand the system. I believe I can control it. Maybe not control it totally. But ... tame it enough to make it do some good.
It sounds like you're talking about a wild animal.
It sounds like you're talking about a wild animal.
Maybe I am.
We got the press this time!
And we got the "big mo"! We're back!
We gotta make 'em think we're just as tough as they are -- that Nixon's a mad bomber, he might do anything! I played a lot of poker in World War II , and I won big, and let me tell you this -- unpredictability is our best asset. That redneck Johnson left me with a shitty hand and I'm bluffing. I've got to
What? Win Vietnam, sir?
But what am I telling the press about Kent State?
Tell 'em what you like; they'll never understand it anyway.
Mr. President, the press guys asked if you could come back for a minute.
The hell with 'em.
No, they want you, Mr. President. I really think it would be a good move.
Gentlemen, I go now to discover the exact length, width and depth of the shaft.
Bernstein.
Who the fuck are they? Bob, are you working on revoking the Posts's television license? Good.
You know, Fred, they sell tickets.
Sir?
Sir?
They sell tickets to an impeachment. Like a fucking circus ... Okay, so they impeach me. Then it's a question of mathematics. How many votes do we have in the Senate?
Shit, plenty of people did their best writing in prison. Gandhi, Lenin ...
That's right.
That's right.
What I know about this country, I ... I could rip it apart. If they want a public humiliation, that's what they'll get. But I will never resign this office. Where the fuck am I?
What's in there?
POWs. And their families.
POWs. And their families.
So I'm supposed to be ...
So I'm supposed to be ...
Compassionate. Grateful.
Compassionate. Grateful.
Proud?
Proud?
Sir?
Sir?
Of them.
Of them.
Yes, yes.
Yes, yes.
Fire him.
There's more ... there's more than just me. You can't break, my boy, even when there's nothing left. You can't admit, even to yourself, that it's gone, Al. Do you think those POWs in there did?
No, sir ...
No, sir ...
Now some people, we both know them, Al, think you can go stand in the middle of the bullring and cry, "Mea culpa, mea culpa," while the crowd is hissing and booing and spitting on you. But a man doesn't cry. I don't cry. You don't cry ... You fight!
And this?! Good Lord, have you lost your mind? Nixon can't say this. "Niggers"!
Well, we could delete it.
Or we could write "expletive deleted."
... and get rid of all these "goddamns" and "Jesus Christs"!
We lost ...
I know ...
I know ...
It's hard to lose ...
It makes us human ...
It's not fair, Buddy. I can take the insults; I can take the name-calling. But I can't take the losing. I hate it.
It's not fair, Buddy. I can take the insults; I can take the name-calling. But I can't take the losing. I hate it.
We don't have to put ourselves through this again, Dick.
We don't have to put ourselves through this again, Dick.
What do you mean? We worked for it. We earned it. It's ours.
What do you mean? We worked for it. We earned it. It's ours.
It is. We know that. And it's enough that we know. Just think of the girls. They're still young. We never see them. I lost my parents. I don't want them to lose theirs; I don't want them to grow up without a mother and father ...
It is. We know that. And it's enough that we know. Just think of the girls. They're still young. We never see them. I lost my parents. I don't want them to lose theirs; I don't want them to grow up without a mother and father ...
Maybe I should get out of the game. What do you think, Buddy? Go back to being a lawyer and end up with something solid, some money at the end of the line ... You know, I keep thinking of my old man tonight. He was a failure, too.

You're not a failure, Dick.
You're not a failure, Dick.
You know how much money he had in the bank when he died? Nothing. He was so damned honest ... But I miss him. I miss him a hell of a lot.
Thank you, Fidel Castro.
You're not going to blame this on Castro, are you?
You're not going to blame this on Castro, are you?
I sure am. The goddamned missile crisis united the whole country behind Kennedy. And he was supporting Brown. People were scared, that's why.
I sure am. The goddamned missile crisis united the whole country behind Kennedy. And he was supporting Brown. People were scared, that's why.
I suppose Castro staged the whole thing just to beat you.
I suppose Castro staged the whole thing just to beat you.
Buddy, before you join the jubilation at my being beaten again, you should remember: People vote not out of love, but fear. They don't teach that at Sunday School or at the Whittier Community Playhouse!
Don't you want to listen to Brown's victory speech?
No. I'm not going to listen to any more speeches ever again.
No. I'm not going to listen to any more speeches ever again.
Amen to that.
Amen to that.
It's over, Dick.
It's over, Dick.
I'll concede in the morning.
I'll concede in the morning.
Not that. Us.
What are you saying? What are you talking about?
I want a divorce.
I want a divorce.
My God -- divorce? What about the girls?
My God -- divorce? What about the girls?
The girls will grow up. They only know you from television anyway.
The girls will grow up. They only know you from television anyway.
It would ruin us, Buddy, our family.
It would ruin us, Buddy, our family.
You're ruining us. If we stay with you, you'll take us down with you. This isn't political, Dick. This is our life.
You're ruining us. If we stay with you, you'll take us down with you. This isn't political, Dick. This is our life.
Everything's political, for Christ's sake! I'm political. And you're political, too!
Everything's political, for Christ's sake! I'm political. And you're political, too!
No, I'm not! I'm finished.
This is just what they want, Buddy. Don't you see it? They want to drive us apart. To beat us. We can't let them do it. We've been through too much together, Buddy ... We belong together.
That's what you said the first time we met. You didn't even know me.
Dick, don't...
Buddy, look at me ... just look at me. Do you really want me to quit?
We can be happy. We really can. We love you, Dick. The girls and I...
If I stop ... there'll be no more talk of divorce?
I'll do it. No more.
Are you serious?
Are you serious?
Yeah ... I'm out.
Yeah ... I'm out.
Is that the truth?
Is that the truth?
I'll never run again. I promise.
Dick, you should call Bobby.
He doesn't want me at the funeral.
He doesn't want me at the funeral.
You don't have to go.
You don't have to go.
De Gaulle's gonna be there. And Macmillan. And Adenauer. Nixon can't not be there.
De Gaulle's gonna be there. And Macmillan. And Adenauer. Nixon can't not be there.
Then call him. I'm sure it was an oversight.
Then call him. I'm sure it was an oversight.
No. It's his way. He hates me. Him and Teddy. They always hated me.
No. It's his way. He hates me. Him and Teddy. They always hated me.
They've lost a brother. You know what that means, Dick.
Were you planning to tell me?
We ... haven't announced anything ... uh ...
Buddy? ...
You should be going ... the primaries are soon, aren't they? New Hampshire ...
You should be going ... the primaries are soon, aren't they? New Hampshire ...
They love you, Buddy. They need you, too.
They love you, Buddy. They need you, too.
I don't want them to love me.
I don't want them to love me.
I need you out there. It won't be like last time. The war's crippled the Democrats. I can win ... We deserve it. Yeah, it's ours, Buddy -- at last. Nobody knows better than you. Frank Nixon's boy.
It was our dream, too, Buddy, together ... always.
Do you really want this, Dick?
Do you really want this, Dick?
This. Above all.
This. Above all.
And then you'll be happy?
Yes ... you know it! Yes ... I will. Yeah!
Then I'll be there for you.
Then I'll be there for you.
You're the strongest woman I ever met. I love you, Buddy.
You're the strongest woman I ever met. I love you, Buddy.
Can I just ask for one thing?
Can I just ask for one thing?
Anything.
Anything.
Will you ... would you kiss me?

You've been drinking. What the hell are you saying? Jesus, you sound like them now! ... I've gotta keep fighting, Buddy, for the country. These people running things, the elite ... they're soft, chickenshit faggots! They don't have the long-term vision anymore. They just want to cover their asses or meet girls or tear each other down. Oh, God, this country's in deep trouble,
No, I don't. I'm not Jack ...
But they never will, Dick. No matter how many elections you win, they never will.
Penny for your thoughts.
Is that adjusted for inflation? Think of the life Mao's led. In '52 I called him a monster. Now he could be our most important ally. Only Nixon could've done that.

You're a long way from Whittier.
Congratulations, Dick.
How am I going to break this to Bob Hope?
Not for the Pentagon it isn't. I'm kissing Mao's ass. And the press is gonna find some way to shaft Nixon on this one.
It's not the press that matters. Nixon's wife is proud of him.
Yes.
When?

That's it! YOU'RE GONE!
Oww, the arm, the arm!
You just don't know when to quit, Roy! You were jealous of me when I got hall monitor in seventh grade, and you're still jealous now!!!

One question, Doctor, please! You can't do this! I'm the press, I have rights!!
One question, Doctor, please! You can't do this! I'm the press, I have rights!!
That's right, you have the right to remain silent.
What if the killers didn't see her? You published her picture -- you're gonna get her killed!
No, we're bringing the community into the effort to find her.

You're lying!

I spoke to Betty Sizemore yesterday. That's right. There's no doubt in my mind, folks... she's on the run. Whether or not she's mixed up in all this remains to be seen...

That's bullshit, Sheriff! You think she's a suspect!
That's bullshit, Sheriff! You think she's a suspect!
I'd like to apologize for our local boy. He's been in love with Betty since the fifth grade, y'see. He means well, but he's in over his head on this.
What the hell do you want?... Hey, Sue Ann, what's up?
We think we know where Betty is.
We think we know where Betty is.
Ah, shit... Do I have to hear this now?
I see you're sticking to the diet Betty put you on...
Worry about your own goddamn lunch!
Worry about your own goddamn lunch!
Tell him what you told me.
Why do I need to see this? Did he ask you to...?
Listen! I saw 'Chloe' and 'Lonnie' on T.V. They're television characters.
Yeah? Well, she called Sue Ann yesterday from Arizona.
She said she was in Arizona, did she?
Come on, Elden, think about it. The driver, all them trunks standing open like that... something's going on here!
I know that...
I know that...
Well, do something, then, damnit!
Well, do something, then, damnit!
You watch your mouth when you're in a goddamn county vehicle... You don't think I see what's going on? Del, now this Cooley fella, both of 'em mixed up with Joyce... 'S not no conspiracy, not some episode off the X-Files... 's just a crime of passion, plain and simple. Betty's on some kind'a pre-minstral rampage, that's what is going on here.
Oww... Did you have to make these things so tight?
No, I didn't have to.
Elden, let me out of here. Now! This is ridiculous, I need medical attention!
That's a nice name for what you need...
That's a nice name for what you need...
Come on, I have to get this dressing off... it itches! And what about my fish? Who is taking care of them?
Just shut up a second and listen... That, uh... that bar in Arizona? Where you said Betty was?
What about it?
What about it?
Any idea where it is?

Little place called "Williams," why?

I just got something off the wire. The woman who owns it was murdered last night. Now, I'm not saying I agree with you or nothing, but... what else do you know?
I just got something off the wire. The woman who owns it was murdered last night. Now, I'm not saying I agree with you or nothing, but... what else do you know?
I know plenty.
That's a lie! I figured it out! I've been trying to tell this dumbass --
Fuck you, Roy Ostrey!
Fuck you, Roy Ostrey!
-- small-time, pissant, Barney Fife --
We're in a shootout, Roy! Shut up about the damn fish!
YOU shut up! They're beautiful, but get them some water.
We need ammo... Go check his jacket, I'll cover you.
I'm not going out there! Let's wait for the real police...
I'm not going out there! Let's wait for the real police...
You gotta go, we're pinned down!
You wanna see if he has more shells, go ahead. I say we wait...
No, no, no... you don't know shit about procedure! You don't send your best...
No, no, no... you don't know shit about procedure! You don't send your best...
I've got the working gun, Elden, me! You wasted all your bullets so you crawl out there.
Uhh, no, we haven't picked a date yet... well, once he dumps her we will. He's out pricing banners... I don't expect him back.
"Banners?"
"Banners?"
You know, flags and shit... he said "for a livelier look" or something.
Need something else?
No, I was just... How you doing?
No, I was just... How you doing?
Great. Good. Content...

'Kay, good. Bye, then...

Uh-huh. Anyway, I'm thinking Easter, 'cause I just fucking love pastels.
Who are these idiots?
This is Roy Ostrey, he's a reporter. And this is Sheriff Ballard. We all went to Fair Oaks High together...
This is Roy Ostrey, he's a reporter. And this is Sheriff Ballard. We all went to Fair Oaks High together...
Oh, this is wonderful...
...I s'pose you did that so I could take my sweater off or something.
No, just stand there... lemme look at you a minute.
Do you know who I am?
...I... I know what you are.
...I... I know what you are.
Do you know why I'm here?
Do you know why I'm here?
I've got a pretty good idea. You're here to kill me, so kill me. You want me to be afraid, but I'm not. I don't care who you are, or why you two killed my husband...
You really... didn't have anything to do with what Del was doing, did you?
I have no idea what he was mixed up in... it was always something.
I have no idea what he was mixed up in... it was always something.
So you weren't involved with him in his pathetic attempt to diversify? Were you mixed up in the drugs, Betty?
So you weren't involved with him in his pathetic attempt to diversify? Were you mixed up in the drugs, Betty?
Drugs? God, no! I'm totally against drugs.
Drugs? God, no! I'm totally against drugs.
Damn, life is strange. I had you figured for this cold-blooded, calculating bitch -- Not that I didn't admire you for it.
...well, if you're not going to slit my throat, why'd you come up here?
...to see you.
...I never meet people like you. I'm a garbageman of the human condition. I deal with trash, mostly, people willing to trade any part of themselves for a few more minutes of their rotten lives. But you... you're different.
I am?
I am?
Sure. You could probably have any thing you wanted... somebody as beautiful and stylish as yourself, and you don't even realize it.
I'm appreciably older than you, but my health is good. I take care of myself, and I got some money socked away. You'd never have to work again, that's for sure. I'd treat you like a queen.
Umm, I don't think that...
Umm, I don't think that...
Wait. Let me get this out. I like the symphony, walks in the rain, sunsets, animals and children. I read passionately, and I like to discuss things. I'm basically conservative, but flexible. I've been involved in the death of thirty- two people, but I can live with that because the world is lighter by thirty- two pieces of shit, excuse my language.

"Thirty-two?"
"Thirty-two?"
Well, thirty-three, but I'm not counting Del, on account of you... so, what do you think? You probably feel I'm flattering myself to see us together.
Well, thirty-three, but I'm not counting Del, on account of you... so, what do you think? You probably feel I'm flattering myself to see us together.
I don't feel that, no. I just... I'm not really who you think I am.
I don't feel that, no. I just... I'm not really who you think I am.
No one is, honey. Here, listen to this... "If who I am and who I hope to be should meet one day, I know they will be friends." Now that's beautiful.
I wrote that when I was twelve... where'd you get that?!
I know. I borrowed it from your grandparents because I... I... it doesn't matter. Don't worry, they're fine... Look, I used to feel that same way, said practically those same words, sitting at night in a foxhole in Korea... I've chased you across the country, Betty, and I come to find out we're a lot more alike than you'd think.

I thought you were a garbageman of humanity, or something.
Yes, but I'd sort of like to put that behind me now...
That's my son! My son is dead!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
You're sorry? YOU'RE THE REASON WE'RE HERE!
You're sorry? YOU'RE THE REASON WE'RE HERE!
WAIT A SECOND! I AM NOT THE REASON YOU'RE HERE! I WAS MINDING MY OWN BUSINESS, LIVING A PERFECTLY BORING LIFE UNTIL YOU CAME ALONG!
If we went out that window right now we'd have a chance...
I better go check on them.
I better go check on them.
Wait, Betty... you still haven't answered me.
Wait, Betty... you still haven't answered me.
This is really awkward...
Ahh, it's too late, anyway. It's too late. Listen, I could shoot my way out, maybe take one of them with me... If you'd gimme my gun back.
I'd rather not...
I'd rather not...
Betty, I don't wanna shrivel up alone in some stinking prison. No way. I've got some professional pride. And I don't want anybody else to get the credit for taking me out.

...what're you saying?
...what're you saying?
When a Roman general knew a battle was lost, he'd throw himself on his sword.
Did... did you really come here because you love this guy?
Yes... Not the actor, though, the doctor. I think.
So all this... really was because of that soap opera? My son is dead because you came out here to be with that doctor? A fake doctor?
I wouldn't have put it quite that way, but...
I wouldn't have put it quite that way, but...
Wesley didn't even want to come up here. He warned me, but I insisted... I have to ask you, Betty...are you crazy?
Wesley didn't even want to come up here. He warned me, but I insisted... I have to ask you, Betty...are you crazy?
I don't think I am.
Of course, I don't know every doctor who works here...
Dr. Ravell's the finest surgeon on the staff. You must know him. He's incredibly handsome, gentle, considerate. He's being sued for sexual assault right now, but -- It's not true. He was set up.

Well, I certainly would have heard about that.

Of course, he's only here two days a week. He's also on staff over at Loma Vista.

It's in a very pretty area that gets a lot of sun, has palm trees out front, mountains in the background...
Really? You've just described all of Southern California.
What you did yesterday was reckless at best. You are not an employee of this hospital! If that boy dies I don't even want to think of the lawsuit that'll follow. Are we communicating here?
Yes, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am.
Good. I'm prepared to offer you a job. You can help out in the pharmacy until your California certification and references arrive, but you are not to touch anyone. Is that totally clear? Fine...
You can start tomorrow. And don't say a word about this to anyone. Is that issue?
Umm... yes. Back home.
Umm... yes. Back home.
Alright. Oh, and one more thing about what you did yesterday... Well done.
Did you watch it yet?
Sure did. I'll tell you, if that man was any better looking it'd be a crime 'a some sort...
Sure did. I'll tell you, if that man was any better looking it'd be a crime 'a some sort...

No... what about your sister?
No... what about your sister?
I can't ask her again -- Nathan, stop it! Jesse, don't take that, hit back! -- I feel terrible, hon.
It's all right.
You sure? Maybe next week we could...
You sure? Maybe next week we could...
Uh-huh. No, we'll do it later. 'S only a birthday, right? I'll have another one next year...
Aahhh... So what color is it?

Sorry, hon. Happy Birthday...

Something bad happened to Del and me, didn't it?
Yeah, hon. Real bad. You just get some sleep, everything's gonna be fine.
Yeah, hon. Real bad. You just get some sleep, everything's gonna be fine.
Sue Ann, I'm sorry about all this, but I just know there's something special out there for me...
Halfway where? You've gotta come home. We've been worried sick about you. Are you alright?
Sue Ann, I thought you of all people would back me up on this, you know what Del's like. How did he take my note?
Sue Ann, I thought you of all people would back me up on this, you know what Del's like. How did he take my note?
Betty, honey, listen to me. A man came by from Mutual Life Insurance. He says you've got money comin' to you from Del's policy. Del's life insurance policy -- Are you with me?
Betty, honey, listen to me. A man came by from Mutual Life Insurance. He says you've got money comin' to you from Del's policy. Del's life insurance policy -- Are you with me?
What are you talking about?
Tell Del I'm sorry. I left so quick, but I need to do this.
Do what?
Do what?
I gotta go.
I gotta go.
Betty! Listen to me! Del is ...
...of course you do. You don't remember me?
I take it I should. I'm sorry.
I take it I should. I'm sorry.
We were engaged.
I beg your pardon?
But I'm the one who's sorry. Letting you go was the biggest mistake of my life. We were thirteen days away from getting married and... I just got scared. It's a mistake I've had to live with for six years. But it's behind me now... And I hope you can put it behind you. I've missed you... David.
That's very kind of you.
The day I left you I just drove and drove. I drove all day and all that night, and I didn't go anywhere. I just kept driving. I stopped at a little country church, and the pastor let me in, and I sat --
Oh, you mean Fred.
No, Del.
No, Del.
Right, Del. Del was one hot salesman. Of cars. He could talk anyone into anything.

You knew Del?!

Honey, I didn't want to tell you at the time, but Del and I go way back. We went to school together. In fact, he saved my life. Two more minutes in that icy water and I would have drowned. But Del jumped in and grabbed me. We fell out of touch eventually, but I still owe him one.

He never told me anything about... that's unbelievable!
I tried to tell myself it was for the best, that there was a reason behind it. But... Del?
There was no plan! I was just young and stupid and scared!

I know that. I can't tell you how many times I've said that to myself in those exact words.
Why do they keep calling you George?
I don't know. Why do you keep calling me George?
I guess we all did. You know, I didn't marry Leslie because I loved her. I married her to forget you...
Oh, David... I'm sorry I caused you that much pain.
Oh my God! What's Lonnie doing here?
You're late, Eric.
Lyla's very nice.
Yes, she is.
Yes, she is.
She told me I was charming and relentless, and would go far in this town. And she said that unlike the other charming, relentless people she knew, she liked me.

I haven't been this happy since I was twelve years old.
What happened when you were twelve?
What happened when you were twelve?
For Mother's Day, I used all my allowance that I'd been saving to take my mother to Kansas City. We got our nails done and had lunch at "Skies," a restaurant at the top of a building from where you can see the whole city. It was the last outing we took together. She died the following year.

At last! I know how much you want this. You're gifted and extremely determined, but... it's not up to me.

I don't think your friend likes me.
She's a little jealous, I think. And confused when it comes to men... So where are we going?
She's a little jealous, I think. And confused when it comes to men... So where are we going?
Well, first I thought Patina, and then the Ivy, but then I thought of somewhere a little more romantic. Like my place.
You never mentioned a 'Stella' to me.
Didn't I?
Didn't I?
No, I would have remembered that name. The only Stella I ever knew was a parrot. Was this before Leslie? Before us?...
I've never met anyone like you, Betty.
I know, that's why we were meant to be together...

Yeah, I felt that way, too, when I first started, but now... the hours, the repetition... it's not all glamour and mall openings anymore. Maybe I should've listened to my people and tried to make the crossover to nights earlier, I don't know... ...I just hope it's not too late for me. God! Listen to me, "Me, me, me." It's so easy to get

In fact, I want you to ad lib, that's the magic I'm after. I wanna give a whole new feel to the show.
David, I don't... Can we talk privately for a second?
Stop calling me David. We're on set, for Christ's sake, you don't have to call me David here.
Why are you doing this to me?
Why am I doing this to you? Isn't this what you wanted?
Well, I don't know what you had in mind, but I hope you're happy. I put myself on the line for you, my reputation, and you're making me look like an idiot.

But I'm David... I mean, I'm not David, but she thinks I am! You heard her... Stop staring at me... I'm not crazy, she is!

Couple 'a guys in from outta town. They want to see the new LeSabres.
And I don't need Sue Ann's fat ass around to fuck it up...
Just knock it off, 'kay? Anyhow, they're 97's, they're not even new.
Just knock it off, 'kay? Anyhow, they're 97's, they're not even new.
They're new to us...
It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
Yeah, I guess there's nothing like watching those tenpins fall, huh, Del?

That is a skill!
Well, are you gonna answer me? What'd you come here for?
I came for love...

You're not on that soap opera thing again, are you? 'Cause you know what that is?

That's right. So, if you know it, why are you in trouble?
That's right. So, if you know it, why are you in trouble?
I don't know.
I don't know.
You sure don't. Who do you think you are coming to Hollywood, anyway? You should remember where you came from. And who you really are.
Hi, Betty. You're looking good...
Thanks, Roy, you're sweet... a big liar, but sweet. I liked your editorial this morning...
Thanks, Roy, you're sweet... a big liar, but sweet. I liked your editorial this morning...
Oh, appreciate it. I was trying to, ahh, give a sense of history to...
Hey, Betty. Are you okay?
I'm great, good, content. What happened to your arm, Roy?
I'm great, good, content. What happened to your arm, Roy?
Oh, nothing, it's fine. I just need to keep it wrapped for a few...

Make sure it's elevated...

Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
You want me to make you a sling? It's no problem...
What're you doing here, Roy?
Well, I was worried about you and I wanted to make sure you were alright... and I guess I was sort of hoping I could ask you about what happened...
Well, I was worried about you and I wanted to make sure you were alright... and I guess I was sort of hoping I could ask you about what happened...
Oh, that... Sure, I saw the whole thing. It was disgusting!

My God... did you get a look at who did it?
My God... did you get a look at who did it?
Yes.
Yes.
You did? Was it anyone that you...?

It was Chloe...

You're in serious danger!

Ahh, look, right now's not very...
Ahh, look, right now's not very...
I woulda' been here sooner, but Ballard put me in jail. He still thinks you had Del scalped.
Have you checked the trunk of that car you're driving, Betty? I think there might be...
It's not really a good time, guys...
What's the matter here?
I begged him to let me put that on!
I begged him to let me put that on!
He's a prick. Merle?... You're a prick.
So you're into "Reason," too? Finally, someone civilized! I'm Ellen, what can I get you?
Hi, I'm Betty. I'll take a Miller, if you got it...
Shut up, Merle... Williams.
Williams, Arizona. About halfway there, I guess.
If that little weasel ever walked in here I wouldn't serve him.
I'd slap his face.
I'd slap his face.
I'd kick him in the nuts, if I thought he had any.
Where you headed, Betty?
Los Angeles, California.
Los Angeles, California.
And you called your friend, and she's telling you not to go? When I went to Europe my friends told me I was crazy.

I should call you Dorothy. When I left here I went straight to Italy. Everybody told me not to go. But I wanted to go to Rome ever since I saw Audrey Hepburn in "Roman Holiday," and goddamnit, I went.

Did you love it?
Did you love it?
Sure I loved it! It was great.
Let me tell you something. I got groped by these Tunisian guys who thought I was a slut for wearing shorts, it was hotter than stink the whole time, and I got some kind of weird gum disease from the water. Plus, it ended my marriage --
That's horrible!
That's horrible!
No, he was a toad. Even more of a toad than Merle... I just wear the ring to keep the flies away. Rome was the best thing I ever did, because I DID IT! And I swear to you, it changed me. I've been to Rome, Italy! I sat every morning at the Cafe Sistina and had my cappuccino, and watched the pilgrims walk
I left my husband two days ago.
Really?
Really?
I'm getting back with my ex-fianc. He proposed to me right around here, so I guess this is just sort of a sentimental stop...

I'll go to the Hospital.

What if you can't find him? What if you get out there, and nothing's the way you thought it was gonna be?

Worse.

You made out alright.

Yeah, but at least I knew Rome was gonna be there when I arrived...
Ellen, this is the biggest thing I've ever done, but I've gotta do it.
You take care of yourself then, Betty, and don't let anybody stop you...
You take care of yourself then, Betty, and don't let anybody stop you...
To tell you the truth, I can't believe I've made it this far. It may not be Europe, but I just know there's something special out there for me...
I can't believe I remembered that, although I suppose I should. I wrote it... But that was seven years ago, and you're quoting it verbatim. I'm flattered... I think. Or frightened. What's your name?
Betty Sizemore. What do you mean you wrote it?
Betty Sizemore. What do you mean you wrote it?
I'm Lyla Branch. I'm the Producer.
Well, David moved out here and started his residency. Then he met Leslie --
No, no, no. We know all that. What happened with you?
No, no, no. We know all that. What happened with you?
I married a car salesman.
She called you 'George,' George.
...did I win some contest?
What are you doing?
He has no heartbeat!

LISTEN TO ME! IF I DON'T DO THIS, HE'S DEAD!
You don't sound like you're from here.
I'm not. I just drove in from Kansas.

So why'd you come to L.A.?
So why'd you come to L.A.?
I came for love. My fiancé is here.
It's something I had to do. For David.
'David.' That's your guy. So, you staying with him?
No... I don't really know where he is yet. I'm at a hotel around the corner.
Man, that is love.
You can go get your stuff right now. I'll walk you down.
No, that's not, I couldn't...
No, that's not, I couldn't...
Listen, when someone does the kind of thing you did, you gotta do something in return. So, you stay with me until you find your David and live happily ever after. Okay?
I got this apartment with a guy.
The one you were telling me about?
The one you were telling me about?
No, this one was worse... I had to have the place sprayed when he left. Twice... He was two guys before the last one -- not counting a little office thing in there, which I'm trusting you with, 'cause if it gets out, I'm on the street...
It's lovely... I really like your aquarium.
Yeah, well, at least fish don't use your razor or pee on the seat...

Hmmm. Sounds like you've had a pretty tough go of it with men...
Hmmm. Sounds like you've had a pretty tough go of it with men...
Oh, I dunno... but just once I wish I'd run into a guy who noticed the Koi before my tits.
Hey, Rosa... it's Betty. How do you get to this town called 'Tustin?' It's in Orange County...
Tustin? Take the Hollywood Freeway to the Five...

Okay... oh, umm, would you mind if I borrowed some clothes?
Huh? Sure, look in my closet, take any dress you want! We're still on for tonight, right?
You made it! Hey, that looks great on you. 'S classy... So, how'd it go today? You find him?
Ummm... no, no. Different 'Ravell.'
You know, the more I think about it, this really isn't David's kind of place.
What are you talking about? This bar is packed with professional people! Everybody says if you're going to get married, this is the spot to meet someone... Luckily, I'm currently off men, so I've got the luxury of not giving a shit.

Jesus, I thought my love life was crazy...
...so, we'll hit the library first and fan out from there. They've got all the L.A. phone books, plus medical directories... We're not gonna let him hide from you any more, okay? I'm making this my personal mission.
David isn't hiding from me, I left him standing at the altar six years ago and now I'm...
David isn't hiding from me, I left him standing at the altar six years ago and now I'm...
Fuck the details, they're always to blame... Look, too many of these guys duck out on us, especially after they become doctors or lawyers. I see it at my company all day long! So I'm just gonna make sure you get your, you know, fairy tale ending or whatever... One of us should.

Rosa, I can't believe you're doing all this for me... thank you.
Hey, how 'bout a card for me? What is that? "Please call if you have any information on David Ravell." This is my phone number! How many of these have you given out?
How many men have I talked to?

Doctor David Ravell.
Doctor David Ravell.
What? Where was he?!

ON TELEVISION!! Cut the shit, will you!
Either you're making a fool out of me because you get off on it, or you got serious problems. Which one is it?!
I have no idea what you're talking about.

Shhh! I heard you the first time.

If you didn't want to do it, you should have said so! Is this about gas money?
If you didn't want to do it, you should have said so! Is this about gas money?
IT'S NOT ABOUT GAS MONEY!! You have a thing for an actor on a stupid white soap opera, and we searched all over town for his character! Not the actor -- whose name is George, by the way. His character!
Why'd you help me in the first place?
I helped you because I'm an idiot! Ask my mother, I love it when people take advantage of me! I TRUSTED YOU!! I THOUGHT HE WAS REAL!
I helped you because I'm an idiot! Ask my mother, I love it when people take advantage of me! I TRUSTED YOU!! I THOUGHT HE WAS REAL!
HE IS REAL!!
I'm not going back on our arrangement. My word is good, and my family owes you. But I think it's best for both of us if you get your own place as soon as you can.
Fine.
Don't worry, I'm looking... just taking a tiny break.
This is crazy. I come home, you go to your room. You go in the kitchen, I go to my room. It's stupid.
So what do you say? Can we be friends?
...okay.
What are those for?
Oh, it's a charity dinner. The money goes to a good cause, but I don't have anybody to go with...
Oh, it's a charity dinner. The money goes to a good cause, but I don't have anybody to go with...
Umm...
Looking for someone?
You never know who you'll see.
Were you with him this whole time?
Oh, God! You scared me! Yes...
Oh, God! You scared me! Yes...
You still in love?
Does he know you think he's real?
He is real.
He is real.
Uh-huh... So, what'd you talk about?

Oh, my gosh, everything! My trip out here, what we've both been doing, you know...

To a party in the Hollywood Hills.

Was it a huge place? With a view of the whole world?

Yes. I'd never been in a place like that before.
Yes. I'd never been in a place like that before.
I have, lots of times. My mother used to clean them. I used to piss in their pools.
This isn't fair, you know. Do you always get what you want?
No, almost never.
No, almost never.
But, you're in love with someone who doesn't exist. You come here, you meet this guy, who should laugh in your face, and instead you leave with him! Betty, you are one-of-a-kind...
Are you sure I can borrow this?
No, please. Go ahead, it's your funeral...
No, please. Go ahead, it's your funeral...
Rosa...
Rosa...
Well, what if this guy's just playing with you? What if he's lying about who he is?

You should have a little faith in people.

Does he ever talk about medicine? His patients, the hospital?
Does he ever talk about medicine? His patients, the hospital?
All the time. It's always "Loma Vista" this, "Loma Vista" that.
Rosa, so you've met David?
Sure did! And a funny thing, Betty, he introduced himself to me as George!
Sure did! And a funny thing, Betty, he introduced himself to me as George!
Oh, he does that. It's this silly game he plays. Half the people who know him call him George.
What are you doing?
I'm going back to... I need to... I don't know.
...this is your sweater, right?
Where are you going?
Where are you going?
I have to leave now.
What? No, I'm not gonna let you just run out of here... You need to talk about what's going on...
You think I'm crazy, Rosa, but you don't know the half of it. My husband was, ahh...
You think I'm crazy, Rosa, but you don't know the half of it. My husband was, ahh...
Your husband?!
Your husband?!
Yes, I had a husband and he was killed two weeks ago in my kitchen. I was right there...
What?! That you had something to do with it?
I don't know. I'm just starting to remember it now. I don't...
I don't know. I'm just starting to remember it now. I don't...
Yeah, but your running away isn't going to help you with all this...
Yeah, but your running away isn't going to help you with all this...
There was blood everywhere, Rosa. I saw it, I think I watched the whole thing happen... Oh my God...
There was blood everywhere, Rosa. I saw it, I think I watched the whole thing happen... Oh my God...
Okay, okay, look, ummm... Let's just talk a little first and you'll feel better, I promise.
These guys are here to help you, Betty.
I don't think so. Rosa, I didn't kill Del... they did.
Blake, I can handle that transplant!
We need someone with the right kind of experience, Lonnie.

I'm not some snot-nosed resident fresh out of medical school, Blake.
No, you're not. You're a good doctor, Lonnie, but you're not David Ravell. I've made my decision. Now, if you'll excuse me...
What can I do for you, gentlemen?
How do you do, Mr. McCord. We're trying to locate a deranged fan of yours,... a Ms. Betty...
How do you do, Mr. McCord. We're trying to locate a deranged fan of yours,... a Ms. Betty...
Deranged. That would be the right word.
That won't be necessary. She's staying with a Rosa something... Hernandez, Herrera. I know it's an 'H' sound... in Silverlake.
Thanks so much. You must get bothered by this kind of thing a lot.

Here's Ghengis Kunt and The Demilitarized Zone. Get it? They're Korean, so they're pretty hot.
You know, it's interesting. The South lost the Civil War, but they still seem to get all the glory.

Andersonville. They did horrible things to men there...
...you can have the best damn running backs in the world, somebody's still gotta block for 'em.
You're a hundred percent right. They rely on what's-his-name's arm too much...
If you ate at the Tip Top you did.
Oh, yes, with the coffee...
Oh, yes, with the coffee...
Yep, Betty pours a pretty mean cup.
I like this. I like doing business in the home. It's cozy... Who's birthday?
Ahh... my wife's.
All right gentlemen, let's get down to it. I need to know if you're for real.
If we're for real?
If we're for real?
You don't exactly look like drug dealers.
We appreciate that. But you just poured me a drink, I'd like to enjoy your hospitality for a few minutes.
Fine. You got five...
Fine. You got five...
It's a nice place you got here. Real comfortable. Sweet little town, Fair Oaks. You like it here?
It's a nice place you got here. Real comfortable. Sweet little town, Fair Oaks. You like it here?
Are you kidding me? What's to like?
What do you mean?
It's a small town, man. I never should have left Omaha. People here think small. They act small. They're a bunch of dumb fucks.
Could you give us an example?
Of what?
Of what?
I'm asking you for an example of one of these dumb fucks being a dumb fuck.
I'm asking you for an example of one of these dumb fucks being a dumb fuck.
I don't follow...
I don't follow...
You're not a dumb fuck, are you, Del?
You're not a dumb fuck, are you, Del?
No...
No...
I didn't think so. So, give me an example of a stupid person doing a stupid thing. Not being stupid, you're equipped to recognize it.

Are we gonna do business here, or not?
All right... lemme see... okay, new Burger King opens up. These assholes get excited and start lining up. Like it's some five star restaurant. The place is mobbed. Right?
Hmmmm. "Five Stars," huh? Is that stupid, Wesley?
You did not just say "Injuns," Del.
The Indians, Injuns, whatever. They're always drunk and doing stupid things.

Well, my idea of stupid is very different from yours. So here's how this is gonna work. Would you take your socks off, please?
Well, my idea of stupid is very different from yours. So here's how this is gonna work. Would you take your socks off, please?
My socks?
Oh, Jesus, please... Please, God.
...and put them in your mouth.
Bourbon, little water, thank you.
Beer, please.
Hey... you got a fine one right here!
Wesley... Your wife's a very lovely woman. Have I seen her before?
Relax, we brought the cash.
I'm just curious. Can't you give me an example?
No, that's ignorant. They just don't know any better.
That's what I thought. You better give me another example.
That's right.
Stupid is trying to sell it to other people who are, by their very nature, untrustworthy.
Stupid is trying to sell it to other people who are, by their very nature, untrustworthy.
That is so right.

Stupid is calling people in Kansas City who are affiliated with the rightful owners of the thing you stole, and trying to sell it to them. Right Wesley?
Stupid is calling people in Kansas City who are affiliated with the rightful owners of the thing you stole, and trying to sell it to them. Right Wesley?
Now, that's really stupid.
Now, that's really stupid.
So you see, we have totally different ideas of what's stupid and what's not. Don't we?
You know, a hundred and fifty years ago you'd have been scalped for that remark about Native Americans. Right here where your house is -- you'd have been scalped.
Hell of a way to die.
Hell of a way to die.
It wasn't always fatal, Wesley. We could scalp Del right now, and he'd be plenty alive to tell us how it feels.
Hold still, Del, we're just talking here... Then you grab a big handful of hair and pull as you cut. It's amazing how easily the scalp comes off.
A mark, huh?
I'm all for them owning casinos, getting rich off the white man's greed. It's a beautiful piece of irony, isn't it, Wesley?
IT SURE IS!!
Are you out of your mind? You scalped him!
You told me how to do it!
You told me how to do it!
That was to get him to talk! Get rid of that thing, will you?
This is great -- just great! Now we don't know where the goddamn stuff is.
He told us it's in the Buick.
He told us it's in the Buick.
We don't know which Buick, do we?
We don't know which Buick, do we?
Well, why'd you shoot him?
Well, why'd you shoot him?
I had to shoot him! It was the only decent thing to do.
I still don't understand how you knew Del was telling the truth.
I saw his soul Wesley. He was face to face with his God, and no one lies in that situation. But your Geronimo act rattled me, and I abandoned my instincts. Never abandon you instincts.
I saw his soul Wesley. He was face to face with his God, and no one lies in that situation. But your Geronimo act rattled me, and I abandoned my instincts. Never abandon you instincts.
I didn't. You gave me a look!
I didn't. You gave me a look!
What 'look'?
What 'look'?
That one look you got! I thought you were done, so I took him out...
That one look you got! I thought you were done, so I took him out...
I wasn't done, I was just sick of hearing him whine. And you didn't take him out, you scalped him. Christ, I almost puked, did I tell you that?
I wasn't done, I was just sick of hearing him whine. And you didn't take him out, you scalped him. Christ, I almost puked, did I tell you that?
Well, why'd you have to tell that Indian story?
Well, why'd you have to tell that Indian story?
What the hell does that mean? If I'd told a Ty Cobb story would you have clubbed him to death with a bat?
It's not here. Let's go.
You just gonna leave these cars sitting here like this?
You just gonna leave these cars sitting here like this?
Why not, it'll confuse 'em... gotta do something, now that you fucked it up.
Why not, it'll confuse 'em... gotta do something, now that you fucked it up.
I wanted to make a statement.
I wanted to make a statement.
Let me tell you something. In our business you can't put food on the table if your phone doesn't ring. The guys who get the calls are good -- not flashy, just good. They get in, they get out. Nobody knows a goddamn thing. Understand? Boom, boom, boom. Three in the head and you know they're dead.

...that's a good motto.
...that's a good motto.
Fine, I'll get you a bumpersticker, but you better start believing it! It's the only statement you need to make.
Mmmm. Well, it was a piece of luck running into you, Duane. I thought I was gonna have to take Wesley out and hose him down. All he talks about is those Japanese gals.
I like 'em small. When you're inside a little Asian chick, it's like your dick is the axle that holds her body together.
We can live with that.
I'm a Yankee, myself. Massachusetts.
Del's dead, by the way. I sent him to the Great Beyond.
Actually, I scalped him, and then you killed him.
He's telling the truth. He doesn't know.
Should I kill him now?
Should I kill him now?
Wait. Any last words, General Lee?
What the hell was that, another statement?
Well, no one ever spit in my face before. Especially some cracker fuck.
Well, no one ever spit in my face before. Especially some cracker fuck.
You have to rise above it. The professionals rise above that kind of thing...
So how do we know that car's still in Fair Oaks?
We don't. But a '97 Le Sabre'll be easy to find if it's here, town this size... He said he gave his wife some car as a gift, remember?
Maybe you don't appreciate the gravity of this situation. It's bad enough that we don't have what we came here for. It's worse that we don't know where it is. And now this. This was supposed to be my last job. I already put the deposit down on my boat. How can you eat at a time like this? I get nauseous just watching
I can eat because I know we didn't kidnap that woman. I can eat because they aren't looking for us. And I can eat 'cause I'm fucking hungry... ...relax. She's gonna end up on a milk carton and that's about it.

I hope you're right...
I hope you're right...
...I know I am. Let's just do what we gotta do here, and get the fuck gone.
So she gets rid of the asshole and is set for life in the same day.
You think so? Joyce says she's timid.
You think so? Joyce says she's timid.
Joyce was screwing Del.
Joyce was screwing Del.
...among others.
...among others.
I'd say that about torches her credibility, wouldn't you?
I'd say that about torches her credibility, wouldn't you?
Yeah, well, if the wife's trying to sell it she'll fuck up. She's an amateur, just like Del was.
No, I see Betty as a Midwestern Stoic type. Ice water in her veins. A clear thinker. Probably a Swede or a Finn.
A 'Finn?' What is a Finn?
A 'Finn?' What is a Finn?
You should read more. Listen to me. I think this woman was waiting for a chance to do this, and we gave it to her. She kept to herself for years, living with a pompous asshole. Then she sees her opportunity, and BOOM! -- she leaves that little mudpatch in the dust. These heartlanders can't figure it out, 'cause that's not their sweet little
Betty, Betty, Betty...
So what the fuck's a Finn?
So what the fuck's a Finn?
Oh, for Chrissakes. It just means the kind of person who can eat shit for a long time without complaining, then cut their momma's throat and go dancing the same night.

Like... us?
Like... us?
No,... like a worthy adversary, Wesley. Like a very worthy adversary.
Wise beyond her years, I'm sure, and such poise, too. Very, very impressive...
Well, then, did you ever get any indication that she wanted to leave her husband?
Thas' it, thas' it... conquer that bitch. What time're they coming?
It's not an exact science, Wesley. He said they'll be here... My Houston contact has always been very reliable.
It's not an exact science, Wesley. He said they'll be here... My Houston contact has always been very reliable.
And then we're gonna do her right here. Right?
And then we're gonna do her right here. Right?
You're always so coarse... "Do her right here." Let's just see what happens, okay? "I wish that I could find a way; To speak my thoughts on Mother's Day. There are no words that quite express; My gratitude or happiness. A pleasant smile perhaps a kiss; I would not fail to give her this. I'd make her glad the whole day through; By sayin'
Let's get out of here. We got another long drive ahead of us. ...the fuck where I do not know, but I know it's gonna be long.
Betty would never dress like that. She's not some trailer park slut!
Okay, thank you, goodbye... Keep in touch...
...She's got class, and poise. Lots of poise...
They said find it. Find her, find it. Finish the job you were paid to do.
Half.
Half.
What?
What?
They paid us half. They still owe us half...
They paid us half. They still owe us half...
There it is again. That lousy attitude that got us here in the first place. That "make a statement," do an end zone dance, shake your ass and sue everybody in sight attitude that's dragging this whole country down the drain. They don't owe us shit, Wesley! WHEN YOU FINISH THE JOB, YOU GET PAID!! WE HAVEN'T FINISHED THE GODDAMN JOB!!
That woman could be in any one of four states. Four big states where the deer and the antelope play, Wesley! We're not in Rhode Island!
I know that.
I know that.
AND TURN THAT FUCKING MUSIC OFF!
Do I deserve this? In the twilight of my career, do I deserve this? I don't think so! I've always tried to do what's right. I never took out anybody who didn't have it coming. I'm a professional! AND WHERE THE FUCK AM I? I'M IN PURGATORY!
Worse... you're in Texas.
Worse... you're in Texas.
Well, I should be in FLORIDA now! If Carl hadn't gone in to get those stones removed, you wouldn't be here and I'd be on my way to the Keys. On my boat, RELAXING WITH A GLASS OF PORT!! Re-ti red!
You don't look comfortable here. That's 'cause you don't like being the center of attention, do you? Nah. You're like me.
What the hell's the matter with you?
That was a really shitty thing to do.
I'm sick of looking at her mother- fucking face.
What? What does she represent?! What could some cornbread white bitch from Kansas who's dragging our sorry asses up and down the Louisiana Purchase possibly mean to you?!! I'd just love to know...
I dunno... something. Why is she doing this to me? Why?...
I dunno... something. Why is she doing this to me? Why?...
I don't know, but when we find her she's gonna die for it.
How'd they describe her?
You know, blonde, thin, whatever...
You know, blonde, thin, whatever...
Not so fast! Slower... 'blonde, thin', yes... Did they say she had style? A kind of grace or anything?
We should go.
We don't have time to look at a hole in the ground. We can make Vegas in four hours. This one's got to be her.

What difference does it make? She wasn't in Kansas City, or Houston, or Dallas. We went to every goddamn place Del mentioned and no Betty. So what the hell makes you think she's in Vegas? You think she's waiting for us with tassles on her titties? Vegas is too crass for Betty.

I said, 'No.' N-O.
"When I grow up I'm going to become a nurse or a veterinarian. I always want to help people and value all life, be it animal, plant or mineral..." Does that sound like a goddamn showgirl to you?
Do you hear yourself right now...? Like a fucking madman...
Every American should see the Grand Canyon. Are you an American?
Yes, I am and we're not going. Act professional.
Well, guess what? I found Betty... where she's been, anyway.
Where? Where is she?
Where? Where is she?
I'm not telling.
I'm not telling.
What?
What?
I'm not telling 'til you straighten up. You been acting like fucking Jerry Lewis on me and this shit's gotta stop or you can forget about your Betty... I mean it.
This doesn't look like the kind of place Betty would go to.
Maybe she had to use the bathroom. She pees, doesn't she?!...
So you believed the bartender. Why?
Well... I think I saw her soul.
Well... I think I saw her soul.
That's good. You're learning. But let me tell you why I know she was lying. First off, Betty would never fall for a soap star. It's beneath her.

Don't Don't you talk about Betty like that. I don't care who she ends up being, you never use that word again. Got it?
Man, you have got to get some therapy.

I said 'got it?'

...yeah, I got it. Come on, you're stretching out my vest...
You made your point... I was wrong.
You were right. Del wasn't lying.
Well, you were right about what that bartender said.
What do your instincts tell you to do now, kid?
Leave. Take this shit back to Detroit and get the rest of our money.

No... if we don't finish this job, how are we gonna look at ourselves in the mirror? This is it for me, Wesley, she's the last one. My instinct says I gotta see this through with her, and if there's one thing I've tried to teach you here --

No, I said to follow 'my' instincts. Now, we go up there and conclude our business. Case closed.
Not her mouth... I've spent many long hours in a car with your face staring back at me. I've seen it painted on the horizon.
What's wrong with you?
This is Betty at twelve.
Very graceful. Perfect form.
Very graceful. Perfect form.
Betty was a lovely child.
I don't like talking bad about the dead, but now that he's gone I can tell you she put up with things in that marriage I wouldn't have. And yes, she, of all people, was the one who defended him. And that's why what that sheriff said makes me so angry.
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
If anyone had paid to have that husband of hers killed, it would have been me.
If anyone had paid to have that husband of hers killed, it would have been me.

...who doesn't?
What'd you get her?
Huh? Oh, umm, a car. So, to a successful transaction...
Isn't that the point?
Yeah, well, I don't have time to screw around. I got buyers in Dallas, Houston and Vegas who are ready to snap this stuff up.
Seems like a nice place.
It is, if you like idiots...
Really?
You better believe it.
Jesus Christ!
He's waiting...

Okay, uh... the, umm, Injuns're stupid.

Alright, I admit it, you had me there. You're better than most of them, anyway... do you have a headshot?
No, wait... what happened next, Betty?
No, wait... what happened next, Betty?
Are you sure you want to encourage this? No, you're right, let's have some fun. So, what did happened next, "Betty"?
Funny, that's just what I was thinking...
I can't tell you how much it hurts me to hear that you married him.
Right, uhh... I feel terrible about this, we have a prior engagement at another party. But... I'd be honored if you'd come.
Yeah, bring your friend along. I'm sure you got a lot of catching up to do...
She makes me stretch! I got inside my character last night like I haven't done in six years on "Reason". It was a totally rejuvenating experience.
I know, George, I was there. I'm not denying that she's good.

If you need a minute, that's okay. But I thought you'd want to --
Is there a problem, George?
No! No problem, there is no... What is the problem? Just do that... thing... you do! Come on! You drove me nuts with this for three days, now do it!
All right, everybody! That's ten minutes!
No! Let me try this!
Let me try this, goddamnit! SHE'S BEEN DOING IT ALL WEEK, SHE CAN DO IT NOW!
I SAID FORGET IT!
This story is beyond belief, which is perfect for us. It's free advertising and it's gonna run for months.
I don't think she can do it. You saw what happened.
I don't think she can do it. You saw what happened.
You fucked it up. Who wouldn't freeze in those circumstances? And I don't care what her problems are. She wouldn't be the first one in that cast with problems. We have nothing to lose by making her an offer.

What about me? Don't you wanna know how I feel about it? I'm the one who...
Why would I give a shit how you feel. And I got news for you. I loved your 'icy water' idea the other day... I'm toying with the idea of killing David Ravell off in a boating accident.
Why would I give a shit how you feel. And I got news for you. I loved your 'icy water' idea the other day... I'm toying with the idea of killing David Ravell off in a boating accident.
That's not a bad idea. How many episodes before he comes back?
Jesus, don't do that! If it gets around that you fired me, I'll never land a pilot.
Then do as you're told. Get her back.

And she always had such spirit! But, after her mother died...
Would you say she was ambitious?
Would you say she was ambitious?
Oh, there's no tellin' what that girl could've accomplished, and she never had it easy. Never really had a childhood... caring for her father, going to school.
You've got to be missing a piece of your soul to kill someone. That's not our Betty...
...why do you think you have to be missing a piece of your soul to kill somebody?

Because it ain't natural, young man.
Because it ain't natural, young man.
What are you talking about? Killing's totally natural. It's dying that isn't natural...
You're wastin' your time, Roy.
Look Joyce, I need your key to the files, not advice, okay? This is a complex case.
Nothin' complex about it. Del's dead, Betty's gone. She's probably dead, too.
You'd like that wouldn't you? You've hated Betty since you were in Pep Squad together...
You'd like that wouldn't you? You've hated Betty since you were in Pep Squad together...

Names, a phone number, something... Listen, Ballard told me that the guy who brought the missing car down from Detroit was murdered, but do you see him doing anything about it? If Ballard wasn't such a stubborn ass, I wouldn't have to be breaking in here...

Loma Vista? You mean like the guy on "A Reason to Love?"
Hey... Is Betty still trying to find that soap opera guy?
Oh, yeah... Man, I'd love to find that actor just to see the look on her face, watch her bubble burst in mid-air.
SHUT UP! Shut the fuck up, both of you, before I kill you!

I wish I could help you, but I can't.

It's Sue Ann Rogers, Betty Sizemore's friend? I heard from her.
I flatter myself that such is the case; in my line of work it's plumb necessary. The one thing you don't want is air in the conversation.
Once again we find ourselves in agreement. What kind of work do you do, Big Dan?
Once again we find ourselves in agreement. What kind of work do you do, Big Dan?
Sales, Mr. McGill, sales! And what do I sell? The Truth! Ever' blessed word of it, from Genesee on down to Revelations!

Thankee boys for throwin' in that fricasee. I'm a man a large appetite and even with lunch under my belt I was feeling a mite peckish.
Our pleasure, Big Dan.
Our pleasure, Big Dan.
And thank you as well for that conversational hiatus; I generally refrain from speech while engaged in gustation. There are those who attempt both at the same time but I find it course and vulgar. Now where were we?
I like to think that I'm a pretty astute observer of the human scene.
No doubt, brother - I figured as much back there in the restaurant. That's why I invited you out here for this advanced tutorial.

It ain't the law!
The law. Well the law is a human institution.
'N I'm Delmar O'Donnell.
How ya been, Wash? Been what, twelve, thirteen year'n?
We ain't gonna make it walkin'.
Gopher, Everett?
You got light fingers, Everett. Gopher?
You mis'able little sneak thief...
That's right!
That's right! We ain't really Negroes!
That's right! We ain't really Negroes!
All except fer our a-cump-uh-nust!
Why don't we bed down out here tonight?
Yeah, it stinks in that ol' barn.
Visit those foreclosin' sonofaguns down at the Indianola Savings and Loan and slap that cash down on the barrelhead and buy back the family farm. Hell, you ain't no kind of man if you ain't got land.
What about you, Everett? What'd you have in mind when you stoled it in the first place?
...Pete?
Do not seek the treasure!
We didn't abandon you, Pete, we just thought you was a toad.
No, they never did turn me into a toad.
No, they never did turn me into a toad.
Well that was our mistake then. And then we was beat up by a bible salesman and banished from Woolworth's. I don't know if it's the one branch or all of 'em.
Well that was our mistake then. And then we was beat up by a bible salesman and banished from Woolworth's. I don't know if it's the one branch or all of 'em.
Well I - I ain't had it easy either, boys. Uh, frankly, I - well I spilled my guts about the treasure.
Well I - I ain't had it easy either, boys. Uh, frankly, I - well I spilled my guts about the treasure.
Huh?!
Huh?!
Awful sorry I betrayed you fellas; must be my Hogwallop blood.
I'm sorry we got you into this, Tommy.
Good Lord, what do we do?
How'd he know about the treasure?
Don't know, Delmar-though the blind are reputed to possess sensitivities compensatin' for their lack of sight, even to the point of developing para- normal psychic powers. Now clearly, seein' the future would fall neatly into that ka-taggery. It's not so surprising, then, if an organism deprived of earthly vision-
What do we do now, Everett?
Fire! I hate fire!
NOW HOLD ON, BOYS-AINTCHA EVER HEARD OF A NEGOTIATION? MAYBE WE CAN TALK THIS THING OUT!
Yeah, let's negotiate 'em, Everett.
...but try getting a decent hair jelly.
Gopher, Everett?
Gopher, Everett?
And no transmission belt for two weeks neither.
Well that's it boys, I been redeemed! The preacher warshed away all my sins and transgressions. It's the straight-and-narrow from here on out and heaven everlasting's my reward!
Delmar what the hell are you talking about? - We got bigger fish to fry-
Delmar what the hell are you talking about? - We got bigger fish to fry-
Preacher said my sins are warshed away, including that Piggly Wiggly I knocked over in Yazoo!

I thought you said you were innocent a those charges.
I thought you said you were innocent a those charges.
Well I was lyin' - and I'm proud to say that that sin's been warshed away too! Neither God nor man's got nothin' on me now! Come on in, boys, the water's fine!
But there were witnesses, saw us redeemed!
That's not the issue, Delmar. Even if it did put you square with the Lord, the State of Mississippi is more hardnosed.
That's not the issue, Delmar. Even if it did put you square with the Lord, the State of Mississippi is more hardnosed.
You should a joined us, Everett. It couldn't a hurt none.
Baptism. You two are just dumber'n a bag of hammers. Well, I guess you're my cross to bear-
Pull over, Everett - let's give that colored boy a lift.
This ain't no laughin' matter, Everett.
What'd the devil give you for your soul, Tommy?
Five... hunnert... thousand... each.
Four hundred, Delmar.
Four hundred, Delmar.
Izzat right?
Izzat right?
What're you gonna do with your share of the treasure, Pete?
Damn! We gotta skedaddle!
I left my pomade in that car! Maybe I can creep up!
I left my pomade in that car! Maybe I can creep up!
Don't be a fool, Everett, we gotta R- U-N-O-F-F-T, but pronto!
Don't be a fool, Everett, we gotta R- U-N-O-F-F-T, but pronto!
Where's Tommy?
Yeah, look at me.
Now you may call it an unreasoning optimism. You may call it obtuse. But the plain fact is we still have... close to... close to...
Now wuddya suppose is eatin' George?
Well ya know, Delmar, they say that with a thrill-seekin' personality, what goes up must come down. Top of the world one minute, haunted by megrims the next. Yep, it's like our friend George is a alley cat and his own damn humors're swingin' him by the tail. But don't worry, Delmar; he'll be back on top again. I don't think we've heard the
Whuhh...
Oh sweet Lord, Everett, looka this!
What on earth is goin' on here! What's got into you, Delmar!
Caintcha see it Everett! Them sigh- reens did this to Pete! They loved him up an' turned him into a horney- toad!
...I'm not sure that's Pete.
Course it's Pete! Look at 'im!
You can't display a toad in a fine restaurant like this! Why, the good folks here'd go right off their feed!
I just don't think it's right, keepin' him under wraps like we's ashamed of him.
I just don't think it's right, keepin' him under wraps like we's ashamed of him.
Well if that is Pete I am ashamed of him. The way I see it he got what he deserved - fornicating with some whore a Babylon. These things-
Uh, we uh-
We're adventurers, sir, currently pursuin' a certain opportunity but open to others as well.
Pete have a brother?
Not that I'm aware.
Deceitful! Two-faced! She-Woman! Never trust a female, Delmar! Remember that one simple precept and your time with me will not have been ill spent!
Okay, Everett.
Okay, Everett.
Hit by a train! Truth means nothin' to Woman, Delmar. Triumph a the subjective! You ever been with a woman?
Hit by a train! Truth means nothin' to Woman, Delmar. Triumph a the subjective! You ever been with a woman?
Well, uh, I - I gotta get the family farm back before I can start thinkin' about that.
Well, uh, I - I gotta get the family farm back before I can start thinkin' about that.

Everett, I never figured you for a paterfamilias.
Oh-ho-ho yes, I've spread my seed. And you see what it, uh... what it's earned me... Now what in the...
So - where's all the money from your armored-car job?
I never knocked over any armored- car. I was sent up for practicing law without a license.
Huh. I guess they'll tack on fifty years for me too.
Boys, we was chained together. I hadda tell ya somethin'. Bustin' out alone was not a option!
It's Tommy! They got Tommy!
Oh my God!
'N turned into a frog -
He was never turned into a frog!
Scuse me... scuse me... we're the next act...
Everett, my beard itches.
What sat mean exactly, Everett?
Well, you'n me'n Pete'n Tommy are gonna be the power behind the throne so to speak.
Well, you'n me'n Pete'n Tommy are gonna be the power behind the throne so to speak.
Oh, okay.
I guess Vernon T. Waldrip is gonna be goin' on relief. Maybe I'll be able to throw a little patronage his way, get the man a job diggin' ditches or rounding up stray dogs.
Is the marriage off then, Miz Wharvey?
We'll go fetch it with ya, Everett.
Honey, it's just - Shutup, Delmar - it's just -
A miracle! It was a miracle!
Aw, don't be ignorant, Delmar. I told you they was gonna flood this valley.

Where's your ring, honey?
I ain't worn it since our divorce came through. It must still be in the rolltop in the old cabin. Never thought I'd need it; Vernon bought one encrusted with jewels.

But I don't mind telling you, I'm awful pleased my adventuring days is at an end...
...Time for this old boy to enjoy some repose.
That's good, honey.
That's good, honey.
And you were right about that ring. Any other weddin' band would not do. But this-here was foreordained, honey; fate was a-smilin' on me, and ya have to have confidence -

Wait a minute! Who elected you leader a this outfit?
Well, Pete, I just figured it should be the one with capacity for abstract thought. But if that ain't the consensus view, hell, let's put her to a vote!
Well, Pete, I just figured it should be the one with capacity for abstract thought. But if that ain't the consensus view, hell, let's put her to a vote!
Suits me! I'm votin' for yours truly!
Suits me! I'm votin' for yours truly!
Well I'm votin' for yours truly too!
Pete's cousin turned us in for the bounty!
The hell you say! Wash is kin!
YOU LOUSY YELLA-BELLIED LOW-DOWN SKUNKS-
Now hold on, Pete, we gotta speak with one voice here - CAREFUL WITH THAT FIRE NOW, BOYS!
Huh?! They dam that river on the 21st. Today's the 17th!
Don't I know it.
Don't I know it.
We got but four days to get to that treasure! After that, it'll be at the bottom of a lake!
How's this a plan? How're we gonna get a car?
Sell that. I figured it could only have painful associations for Wash.
To Washington Bartholomew Hogwallop. From his loving Cora. Ay-More Fie- dellis.
It was in his bureau.
Who was fixing to betray us!
You didn't know that at the time!

That don't make no sense!

Pete, it's a fool looks for logic in the chambers of the human heart. What the hell's that singing?
Well, I'll be a sonofabitch. Delmar's been saved!
Pete, don't be ignorant-
The preacher said it absolved us.
For him, not for the law! I'm surprised at you, Pete. Hell, I gave you credit for more brains than Delmar.
Hell, at least it woulda washed away the stink of that pomade.
Join you two ignorant fools in a ridiculous superstition? Thank you anyway. And I like the smell of my hair treatment - the pleasing odor is half the point.
A million dollars.
Million point two.
An' all my meals for free...
What about you, Delmar? What're you gonna do with your share a that dough?
Me? Oh, I didn't have no plan. Still don't, really.
Well that hardly sounds like you...
The hell it ain't square one! Ain't no one gonna pick up three filthy unshaved hitchhikers, and one of 'em a know-it-all that can't keep his trap shut!
Pete, the personal rancor reflected in that remark I don't intend to dignify with comment, but I would like to address your general attitude of hopeless negativism. Consider the lilies a the goddamn field, or-hell!- take a look at Delmar here as your paradigm a hope.
Itta Bena, now, uh, that would be...
Isn't it, uh...
...Nah, that ain't right... I'm thinkin' of...
...I believe, unless I'm very much mistaken - see, we've been away for several years, uh...
It was a moment a weakness!
Quitcha babblin' Pete - time to skedaddle.
They lured me out for a bathe, then they dunked me'n trussed me up like a hog and turned me in for the bounty.
I shoulda guessed it - typical womanly behavior. Just lucky we left before they came for us.
It's awful white of ya to take it like that, Everett. I feel wretched, spoilin' yer play for a million dollars'n point two. It's been eatin' at my guts.
Aw, that's all right.
Pete, uh, I don't want ya to beat yourself up about this thing...
I cain't help it, but that's a wonderful thing to say!
I cain't help it, but that's a wonderful thing to say!
Well, but Pete...
Fact of the matter - there never was!
But... but...
But...
Damnit, I just hadda bust out! My wife wrote me she was gettin' married! I gotta stop it!
...No treasure... I had two weeks left on my sentence...
I couldn't wait two weeks! She's gettin' married tomorra!
I couldn't wait two weeks! She's gettin' married tomorra!
...With my added time for the escape, I don't get out now 'til 1987... I'll be eighty-four years old.
Pete... I do apologize.
Eighty-four years old! I'll be gummin' pab-you-lum!
Well, it's a invitation-only affair; we'll have to sneak in through the service entrance-
Wait a minute - who elected you leader a this outfit? Since we been followin' your lead we got nothin' but trouble! I gotten this close to bein' strung up, n'consumed in a fire, 'n whipped no end, 'n sunstroked, 'n soggied -
This is crazy. No one's ever gonna believe we're a real band.
No, this is gonna work! I just gotta get close enough to talk to her. Takin' off with us is got a lot more future in it than marrying a guy named Waldrip. I'm goddamn bona fide. I've got the answers!
We prayed to God and he pitied us!
It just never fails; once again you two hayseeds are showin' how much you want for innalect. There's a perfectly scientific explanation for what just happened -

Great.

Yeah, I made some money down there, then I talked my way into another college and I did it. I wasn't magna cum laude but I did okay. You should've seen me in my cap and gown.

Why the fuck didn't you invite me? I would've come.
Ay, palequero. Never hochi in the P.I.
Wha-chu-say, palequero? Short time, long time, only ten dolla.
So what're you doing in Seattle?
Get ready pard. This one's gonna blow you away.

I joined the Navy.
You... in the Navy?
That's right. I'm on my way over to this officer school in Port Ranier.
That's right. I'm on my way over to this officer school in Port Ranier.
Why?
Why?
To fly jets. To be the fastest motherfucker in the world. You gotta come and visit me. I'm only a couple hours away.

Who gave you this idea?
Who gave you this idea?
Nobody. It just came to me.
Don't be pissed. I'm on your side, Pard. I just don't want you to do something you'll regret. You gotta give six years to the Navy if you wanna fly... that's six years with the most uptight assholes God put on this earth. Officers aren't like you and me, man. It's another breed.
You afraid you'll have to salute me, Chief?
You afraid you'll have to salute me, Chief?
Fuck, no! Why would I care about something as dumb as that?
Fuck, no! Why would I care about something as dumb as that?
I don't know. That's just how it sounded. Well, I'll see you.
Hey, what did you want? A lot of fatherly bullshit? A big pat on the back?
From you, pard? Never. Thanks for the graduation present.
From you, pard? Never. Thanks for the graduation present.
Hey, Zackie -- don't go away mad.
Who's that?
Nobody. Just a girl I've been making it with the last couple of weekends.

Who? Aw shit, Zackie, let's not get off on your mother again, please.
What if I want to talk about her, pard? What then? You know, that's all I've ever heard from you, since I was a kid... you never want to talk about that, man, and it's important.
What if I want to talk about her, pard? What then? You know, that's all I've ever heard from you, since I was a kid... you never want to talk about that, man, and it's important.
There's nothing to talk about. Two goddamn times I made it with your old lady. We barely even talked.
That's not how she told it. She said you wrote her every week you were away.
I wrote. Not every week...
I wrote. Not every week...
She said you told her in every letter how much you loved her, how you wanted to marry her, have children with her...

What did you call her? What did I hear you call her, you son of a bitch?
I knew you'd make it! Where's your girl? Didn't she come?
Naw. That's over with.
You're pretty funny, Mayo.
Maybe we'll be roommates, Seeger, and you'll find out how funny I really am...
Hey, baby, you could get sent to war, get your ass shot down.
Don't lose any sleep over it. I wouldn't mind being the first woman to fly a jet fighter in combat.

You got it, Sweet Pea. Nice boonies, Seeger.
Zack, we've got to go.
Just trying to have fun. That fucking prison is really starting to get to me. C'mon, Seeger. Gimme a push. Fuck you guys! I'll do it myself!
Go on, Zack! Go for the record!
Fuck the record. Now you listen to me and do exactly what I tell you. Start back ten yards and take off from here. Not here... or there... but right here! No excuses, Seeger! You are going to plant those legs here and then you're going to yank yourself over that wall because you have to! You want jets? Then do it, goddamnit!
Joe!
Come over here where I can see you.
Esther, do you think she's using... ...birth control?
Yes, Joe.
Yes, Joe.
When did this happen?
When did this happen?
A long time ago.
He doesn't mean anything by it, Zack. Do you, Joe?
I don't mean anything by it.
Are you laughing at me, dick-brain?
No, sir!
What's your name, boy?
Mayo, Zack Mayo, sir!
Mayo, Zack Mayo, sir!
How did you slip into this program, Mayo? I didn't know the Navy was so hard up. You got an injury there, Mayo?
How did you slip into this program, Mayo? I didn't know the Navy was so hard up. You got an injury there, Mayo?
Not exactly, sir.
Where'd you get this, Mayo? This is really wonder work.
Subic Bay, sir. In the Philippines.
Subic Bay, sir. In the Philippines.
I thought I recognized the work. Be proud of those wings. They're the only ones you're gonna leave here with, Mayo-naise.
I want your D.O.R.
No, sir. You can kick me out, but I'm not quitting.
No, sir. You can kick me out, but I'm not quitting.
Get into your fatigues, Mayo. Before the weekend's out, you'll quit.
She may not make it through the program, but she's got more heart and more character than you'll ever have. I've seen your college record. I've never heard of most of those schools. Tell me something, Mayo. Did you buy that degree?
No, sir! It was the hardest thing I ever did, sir! Until this.
No, sir! It was the hardest thing I ever did, sir! Until this.
That's a lie, Mayo. You've gone through a lot worse, haven't you?
Stop eyeballing me, mister! I've looked through your file and done a little checking, and I know it all. I know about your mother. I know your old man's an alcoholic and a whore chaser. Life sure has dealt you some shitty cards! Hasn't it, Mayo?
I'm doing okay, sir.
I'm doing okay, sir.
No you're not. You're failing the big one, baby, and I don't just mean in here. I mean in life. I've watched you, Mayo, and you don't mesh. You grab-ass and joke around but you don't make friends, not the way the others do.
Hey, what do you say we call off this little charade of yours over a couple of beers at Trader Jon's...? Come on, man. You're about as close to being officer material as me.
Sir, this candidate believes he'll make a good officer, sir!
Sir, this candidate believes he'll make a good officer, sir!
No way, Mayo. You don't give a shit about anybody but yourself and every single one of your classmates knows it. Think they'd trust you behind the controls of a plane they have to fly in? Hey, man, I figure you for the kind of guy who'd zip off one day in my F-14 and sell it to the Cubans.

Sir, that's not true! I love my country!
Sir, that's not true! I love my country!
Sell it to the Air Force, Mayo!
I want to fly, sir!
That's no reason. Everybody wants to fly. My grandmother wants to fly. You going after a job with one of the airlines?

Not a fucking chance, asshole!
Mayo, are those your friends?
Yes, sir!
Yes, sir!
Maybe there's hope for you yet.
You didn't kick him out...? Wait, didn't he tell you what he's been going through?
It doesn't matter what he's going through. That's the whole purpose of this zoo. What matters is he freaked out for some reason at twenty-five thousand feet and that can't ever happen again.

But you don't understand. There's this girl he's gotten pregnant and she's putting him through hell, sir.
I thought the D.I.'s were supposed to help you in this place! What kind of human being are you?
Stop eyeballing me, Mayo, or you're out!
Mayo, the rest of your class knows about candidate Worley, and we're all sorry.
Sir, this officer candidate requests permission to speak to you in private.

Mayo, you didn't hear me -- I said I I'm busy! And so are you! Go get cleaned up!
Aw screw it...
What're you waiting for, Mayo? Get your scuzzy ass up here.
Yes, sir!
You're good.
Get on your feet and find out how good, sir.
Congratulations, Ensign Mayo, sir!
I'll never forget you as long as I live, Sergeant.

I know.

Well, goodbye.
See you in the fleet, sir!
Yeah. See you in the fleet, Sarge. And thank you.

How're you doing, Sarge?

Whatever you say, Mayonnaise.
Fall out on the lawn in five minutes, in your Poopie suits!
What did you call me, Mayo?
Zack, don't!
Now when I say "understand" I want the whole group to say, "Yes, sir!" Understand?
Yes, sir!
Yes, sir!
Louder!
Louder!
Yes, sir!!
Yes, sir!!
I don't believe what I'm seeing! Where've you been all your lives, at an orgy? Listening to Mick Jagger and bad mouthing your country, I'll bet.
Stop eyeballing me, boy! You are not worthy enough to look your superiors in the eye. Use your peripheral vision! Understand?!
Yes, sir!
I know why most of you are here. We're not stupid. But before you get to sell what we teach you over at United Airlines, you gotta give the Navy six years of your life, Sweet Pea. Lot of things can happen in six year. Another war could come up in six years. If you're too peaceful a person to dump napalm on an
Yes, sir!
I know I'm late and I'm sorry, but Mrs. Rufferwell asked us to help with the cleanup and...
I said, come here!
Daddy, I don't want to get into anything with you tonight. I'm tired and I...
What are you tired from?
I don't know what it is. It could be anything.
But you knew right off what I was talking about, didn't you, Paula! Did you let that boy --
Don't you dare ask me that question. I'm an adult and you got no right to push your nose into my affairs like that!
Well, as long as you live in this house, young lady, you live by my rules! You should be dating local boys.
Well, as long as you live in this house, young lady, you live by my rules! You should be dating local boys.
Uh-uh! Not a chance! There's nobody in this town doing anything with his life, except what his father did, which is nothing. If I can't have more out of life than that, I'd rather be dead!

Yes I do!
Yes I do!
Then you're dumber than I thought! All you'll get from their kind is pregnant!
Is this you boys first night of liberty since you got here?
Yes, ma'am. Four long, hard weeks of sacrifice for my country... for my people... for you. But I survived.
You been through the Dilbert Dunker yet?
Cake walk. Both my dad and my brother went through it and made it, so I know I can.

He was. He died.

Vietnam?

Yeah.
Yeah.
I had a big brother who died over there, too. He wasn't no flyer though. He was just your basic Marine Corps type. I was only twelve when it happened, so I don't remember much about him.

I sure remember Tommy. Mind if we talked about something else?
I sure remember Tommy. Mind if we talked about something else?
We don't have to talk at all.
Something tells me you've been here before.
Now what on earth would give you an idea like that?
You're sure it's okay?
Don't worry. I'll respect you afterwards.
What would you girls like to do? Want to stick around here for a little or... or could I suggest another plan...?
Like pick up some booze and go to a motel?
Like pick up some booze and go to a motel?
Or we could do that yeah.
Sid Worley, I think you're ashamed of me.
Ashamed? No -- I love you, Lynette. I mean that. After I leave them, I'll meet you at the motel, okay?

By the way, shouldn't you have had a period by now?
I'm a little late, that's all.
I'm a little late, that's all.
How late?
How late?
What difference does it make? If anything was to happen, which I'm sure it isn't, it would be my responsibility.

Exactly how late are you, Lynette?

What do you care? Suppose I was pregnant. Just suppose it. You don't think I'd try to make you do anything you don't want to, do you?
What do you care? Suppose I was pregnant. Just suppose it. You don't think I'd try to make you do anything you don't want to, do you?
No. But that's not the only issue here, sweetheart. There's a lot more to it than that.
What other issue is there, Sid?
My responsibility as its father, for one. I mean, if I've made you pregnant, I'd want to... do the right thing.
...I'd want to pay for the abortion... I'd want to be with you through the whole thing... by your side. So how late are you, Lynette?
Let's just wait and see what happens.
Hi, babe. Come on. I've got a couple of things I want to tell you.
What're you doing out of uniform, Sid? You don't want to get in trouble.

I can't go like this. Can't you wait a few minutes 'til I'm ready?
I can't go like this. Can't you wait a few minutes 'til I'm ready?
No way. I'm so happy I'm about to bust. Here, honey. This is for you. It cost me my whole savings, but I said what the fuck.
Sid! Oh, it's beautiful! You mean...
That's right. Let's get married, Lynette. Let's find a justice of the peace and just do it!
Let's go tell Paula! God, I wonder where we'll be stationed first. I hope it'll be Hawaii. I've always wanted to go to Hawaii.
We're not gonna be stationed anywhere, baby. I DORed.
We're not gonna be stationed anywhere, baby. I DORed.

I had to, baby... I'm no aviator. I was faking it, like I was with everything else in my life... up 'til right now.

But... but what would we do? Where would we go?
But... but what would we do? Where would we go?
Oklahoma. I can get my old job back at JC Penney's. In a couple of years, I'll be floor manager. Oh, you're gonna love Oklahoma, Lynette. You and mama'll get along just great. Of course, money will be a little tight for a while, but we'll make it.

That was you guys, huh?
Come on. Let's go dance.
Hurry, Lynette. It's almost midnight.
I got my foot on the floor.
Well, it you're not gonna ask, then I will. How was it?

Everything was different.
But in what ways?
How did it go with you guys?
Big Sid came in about two and a half seconds, then had the nerve to ask, 'Did you make it, too, sweetheart?'
He ask you out for next weekend?
No, but I told him I'd be at the Town Tavern next Saturday night, and he sounded like he might come.
No, but I told him I'd be at the Town Tavern next Saturday night, and he sounded like he might come.
I told Zack about Saturday night, too. The fifth week's supposed to be the roughest. Come Wednesday, he'll be wishing he took my number.

He'll show. I'd bet my paycheck on it.
You serious about having him over?
I haven't made up my mind.
Paula, how far would you go to catch Zack?
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
You know what I mean. Would you... let yourself get pregnant?
You know what I mean. Would you... let yourself get pregnant?
No way... Would you?
No way... Would you?
I never used to think I'd do something like that, but now I'm not so sure. You ask me, nine weeks just ain't long enough to get a guy to fall in love with you.
I never used to think I'd do something like that, but now I'm not so sure. You ask me, nine weeks just ain't long enough to get a guy to fall in love with you.
That don't justify trying to trap a boy by getting pregnant, Lynette! Nothing justifies that. I can't believe you're even thinking like that. I mean, that's really backward.

No more backward, if you ask me, than the way these hotshot assholes fuck us, then ditch us. Don't you ever feel used, Paula? Don't you ever feel like if this is all you get for your trouble then the sonofabitch ought to be paying for it...?

Lynette, where's Sid?
Already come and gone. Can you believe it? He DORed in the twelfth week. How can you win?
God help you, Lynette!
You're no better than me, Paula! You're just the same!
You're no better than me, Paula! You're just the same!
No! That's not true!
God! I've never seen anything like that in my whole life! Did you see that guy's nose?
Lynette, just keep your mouth shut until we get to the motel. Will you do that for me, please.
Lynette, just keep your mouth shut until we get to the motel. Will you do that for me, please.
Well, excuse me for livin'!
What did you tell him about the baby?
That there isn't one, as of today. I had my period. I couldn't believe it. He still wanted to marry me.
That there isn't one, as of today. I had my period. I couldn't believe it. He still wanted to marry me.
And you turned him down??
And you turned him down??
Of course. I don't want no Okie from Muscogee. I can get that right here in Port Angeles.
You little bitch! How could you? Was there ever a baby, Lynette? That's all I want to know! Did you make up that baby, Lynette? Did you??
Of course there was a baby. I'd never lie about something like that. Would I, Paula?
Hey, what kind of name is Pokrifki?

You got a girl?
No, and I'm not looking for one either.
I hear most of the girls who come to these things are looking for a husband.
Not me.
Not me.
Yeah? Why're you here?

I vote for the motel.
My kinda group!
I shouldn't have done that. I should've walked.
He didn't give you much choice.

There's always a choice.

Where'd you learn to fight like that?

I don't feel like talking, if you don't mind.
I don't feel like talking, if you don't mind.
Opening up just a little wouldn't kill you, ya know.
You want me to fuck you? Is that it? Okay, come here. Take your clothes off. Get into bed.
Where's that coming from? I wouldn't fuck now if my life depended on it!
Where's that coming from? I wouldn't fuck now if my life depended on it!
Forget it. Just get out of here.
I don't know who you think you're talking to! I ain't some whore you brought here! I've been trying to be your friend and you treat me like shit!
Be a friend. Leave.
Be a friend. Leave.
You got no manners and you never tell the truth! You're nothin' special. And if you ask me, you got no chance at all of being an officer!
You stayed after all.
Wrong. I've driven a hundred and twenty miles, told a hundred and twenty lies, and said a hundred and twenty Hail Mary's since I saw you. Hungry?
Wrong. I've driven a hundred and twenty miles, told a hundred and twenty lies, and said a hundred and twenty Hail Mary's since I saw you. Hungry?
I'm starving.
Paula, I never try to fool anybody about who I am, what I want... so if even in the back of your --
I know who you are and what you want.
I know who you are and what you want.
What do you want, Paula? What do you really want?
What do you want, Paula? What do you really want?
To have a good time with you until you have to go.
To have a good time with you until you have to go.
That's it?
Zack, I dare you not to fall in love with me. I ain't gonna get serious with you, no way. But how can you resist me? I'm like candy.
You're better than candy.
You're better than candy.
I'm serious. It's gonna be hard to get enough.
Zack, when you're through with a girl, what do you do? Do you say something or do you just... disappear?
I've never had a girl.
I forgot to thank you for breakfast.
Any time, sailor.
That was great.
It sure was.
Want me to get a towel?
I'll get it if you want.
I'll get it if you want.
I don't want you to move.
I don't want you to move.
I don't want to move. But somebody has to move sometime. Eventually.
I don't want to move. But somebody has to move sometime. Eventually.
They found them like that, shriveled up from weeks without food or water...
You know, sometimes I wish I was one of those girls they're letting in the flight program these days. God, I'd love to fly.
What's stopping you?
I don't care what the magazines say... it's just not as easy being a girl, especially from a Catholic family. You don't know the junk I grew up listening to, 'bout the way women are supposed to think and act.
That's no excuse for not going after what you want.
That's no excuse for not going after what you want.
Who says I'm not going after what I want? My mother's thirty-nine years old and she still works in that factory. Every time I see her, I know exactly what I don't want.
My old lady swallowed a bottle of pills one day while I was at school.
God.
God.
The thing that really got to me... she didn't leave a note. Nothing. I've always hated her for that.
The thing that really got to me... she didn't leave a note. Nothing. I've always hated her for that.
Does it still hurt?
Does it still hurt?
Naw. You're alone in this world no matter what kinda folks or background you had. Nothing hurts, pard, once you got that one down.
I'm sorry. I can't sit with you.
I understand. Maybe we'll see each other after the show...
What's the matter?
Nothing. Go back to the show, Paula.
Nothing. Go back to the show, Paula.
I've seen all that a hundred times.
I've seen all that a hundred times.
Hey, will you just leave me alone?
Come on. Invite me. All day the idea of a family Sunday dinner's been coming into my head. Since you're the only one I know around here with family...
Zack, I don't know if I want to do that...
Hey, what about Sunday dinner? When're you gonna let me know?
When I'm good and ready.
Hi.
Are those for me?
Are those for me?
No, they're for your mom.
I'm so embarrassed. I knew I shouldn't have brought you here.
No, it's okay. It was a great free meal. Everybody was so uptight I felt sorry for you.
No, it's okay. It was a great free meal. Everybody was so uptight I felt sorry for you.
That's okay. I'm used to it.
So, after you graduate you go on to basic flight, right? Is that in Pensacola?
Yeah, then if I get jets, it's on to Beeville, Texas.
Zack, do you ever think about what it'd be like to have kids... a family.
No. Is that what you want?
No. Is that what you want?
Some day. When I'm sure I can do a better job of it than my folks.
Some day. When I'm sure I can do a better job of it than my folks.
What would you do differently?
What would you do differently?
For a start, I wouldn't marry a man I wasn't in love with.
For a start, I wouldn't marry a man I wasn't in love with.
Why'd your mom marry that guy if she didn't love him?
Why'd your mom marry that guy if she didn't love him?
Because my real father wouldn't marry her.
Because my real father wouldn't marry her.
Your real father?
Your real father was an Officer candidate like me?
Twenty-two years ago.
Twenty-two years ago.
No wonder he was looking at me like that.
Call me during the week if you get the chance.
I'll try, but this week we go into survival training, so I can't make any promises. Well, thanks again for dinner. Thank your mom again for me, will you?
I'll try, but this week we go into survival training, so I can't make any promises. Well, thanks again for dinner. Thank your mom again for me, will you?
Sure. Zack, I hope you know I didn't have to show you that picture.
Sure. Zack, I hope you know I didn't have to show you that picture.
I know that.
I'm looking for Sid.
So?
So?
Paula, he DORed and nobody's seen him.
Paula, he DORed and nobody's seen him.
Why'd he do it?
Why'd he do it?
Hey! You know goddamn well what happened so let's not play any games, okay?
Hey! You know goddamn well what happened so let's not play any games, okay?
I'm not playing any games! Go look at Lynette's!
I'm not playing any games! Go look at Lynette's!
I don't know where that is.
I'd like to come with you.
Why?
Why?
Because he's my friend, too.
Please stop it. None of that's true. Goddamnit, I love you. I loved you ever since I met you.
Come on, Paula! You were looking for a ticket out of here and you didn't care who it was, any more than you cared with the last class of candidates you and Lynette fucked your way through, looking for a husband! Or the class before that!
Come on, Paula! You were looking for a ticket out of here and you didn't care who it was, any more than you cared with the last class of candidates you and Lynette fucked your way through, looking for a husband! Or the class before that!
Yeah. You got the whole story just right.
Yeah. You got the whole story just right.
Beware of the Puget Debs -- and we all laughed, especially him.
Beware of the Puget Debs -- and we all laughed, especially him.
I'm not a Puget Deb. I hate that goddamn term!
I'm not a Puget Deb. I hate that goddamn term!
I bet you do!
I bet you do!
However you got it figured, I didn't kill Sid and Lynette didn't kill him! He killed himself!
However you got it figured, I didn't kill Sid and Lynette didn't kill him! He killed himself!
That's brilliant.
That's brilliant.
Maybe not, but it is the truth. And Zack, you didn't kill him either.
How do you figure that's your bunk?
He said it's up to us and I got here first, didn't I?
Two bucks a buckle, Perryman. Look at that shine! Boonies'll cost you five.
Who's got two bucks? It's costing me every penny they pay us just to keep my old Lady and my kids in that motel.
Hey, man, is the piss-ass money you're making off this worth the risk of getting us all kicked out of here on an honor violation?
I don't notice anyone else complaining.
I'll never get it polished in time. Give me a buckle, Zack.
I can't risk it.
I can't risk it.
You'd make it. He's just getting to the girls. Come on, Zack. I gotta see my family, man. I couldn't take it if he keeps me here over the weekend.
You'd make it. He's just getting to the girls. Come on, Zack. I gotta see my family, man. I couldn't take it if he keeps me here over the weekend.
Sorry, pard. Wouldn't want you to get an honor violation.
I see you didn't DOR, Mayo.
Hey, Sid, thanks.
Hey, do you guys ever... feel like you don't belong here...?
Yeah. All week long.
How about that prick! He told me he wasn't officer material because he grew up poor like me.
He said he grew up poor?
He said he grew up poor?
The kid on the windy side of the baker's window. That's how he put it.
The kid on the windy side of the baker's window. That's how he put it.
Foley's not poor. Buddy of mine in oh-four told me he's the son of a rich doctor down in Louisiana.
That Foley looks like he's been through a war or two.
I've seen better.
Think there's any truth to what he was saying about those girls? Is that still going on?
Sure it is, Sweet Pea, but he should've warned you 'scuzzy' female types about the 'Puget Dudes.' They'll tell you they're wearing a rubber but they've bit a little hole in the end.
Jets.
I hate to tell you guys, but only two out of every class make it into jets. Which one of you is going with me?
Hey, you gonna tell anybody about this?
Not if you make it worth my while. How about free boonies for the duration?
You told us it would grow out an inch.
It's grown out more than an inch, sweetheart.
Could you believe those girls!
'Nellie's Nymphos!'
'Nellie's Nymphos!'
Jesus, that Lynette! I rode her hard and put her up wet.
Look at Foley! Can you believe it!
Shhhh...
Nice, hospitable folks they get around here. I hope she comes.
She'll come, pard. A rich socialite Oakie like you oughta be a big catch around these parts.
She'll come, pard. A rich socialite Oakie like you oughta be a big catch around these parts.
Get off my case, Mayo. I didn't grow up rich.
You okay?
Sure.
Hey, you guys still awake?
Yeah.
What's the matter, Sweet Pea. Foley finally starting to get to you?
Naw.
That isn't true, is it?
A little.
I kid you not, Mayo, I am in love. We must've set a new indoor record today. You want to know how many times we did it?
You'd better get smart, man. It's time to walk away.
You'd better get smart, man. It's time to walk away.
What? You've gotta be kidding!
What? You've gotta be kidding!
Remember what Foley said? His little warning? Those are the girls he was talking about. They're out to marry us any way they can.
Remember what Foley said? His little warning? Those are the girls he was talking about. They're out to marry us any way they can.
I don't believe that. They're just having a good time, same as us.
I don't believe that. They're just having a good time, same as us.
That's what they want you to think, but I saw where she lived, what is she's trying to get away from. Just take my word for it, pard. Break it off now. Do it this week.
Thanks for covering for me.
No problem, but who's Susan?
No problem, but who's Susan?
My girl back home. We're supposed to get married after I get my wings. She was Tommy's girl. They were engaged to be married before he died. I should've told you about her. I don't know why I didn't, except I didn't want you to think I was a shit for making it with Lynette.

I'm not your folks, man. You love this... Susan?
I'm not your folks, man. You love this... Susan?
She's the sweetest person I've ever known. Loves kids. Works with handicapped kids every afternoon at the church. Everybody loves her.

I didn't ask you all that, Sweet Pea. I asked if you loved her.
I didn't ask you all that, Sweet Pea. I asked if you loved her.
Listen, I'm not going to go to that little reunion party. I'm meeting Lynette at the motel. Best head in fifty-two states. After three days of survival training, how could I resist?
You should've done what I did. A clean break.
Lynette told me it really tore her up when you didn't call this week.
Talk to me in the morning. I feel like shit.
But it can't wait.
Calm down, Sweet Pea. She seen a doctor?
No, but she's gotta be at least a month late.
No, but she's gotta be at least a month late.
Doesn't mean shit. Get her to a doctor. You can't do anything until you hear what he says. Make the appointment yourself.
It's a big religious thing with her and she won't even discuss it.
But she expects you to marry her?
But she expects you to marry her?
She said it was up to me. If I don't, she'll go off and have the baby on her own somewhere.
So what's the problem? Girls do that all the time.
I can't let her go off and have the kid by herself and not do anything. If it's my kid, too, then I've got a responsibility, don't I?
I can't let her go off and have the kid by herself and not do anything. If it's my kid, too, then I've got a responsibility, don't I?
Not if she won't even talk about an abortion.
Not if she won't even talk about an abortion.
But it would still be my kid. That's the point.
But it would still be my kid. That's the point.
Do you know that for sure?
Do you know that for sure?
It's mine.
Okay, but what if it's like Foley said and she got knocked up, to trap you -- is it still your responsibility?
No matter how it happened, if she goes ahead and has it" Zack, there'll be a child in the world that's mine -- and I couldn't go through life knowing that and not knowing its name or where it lived.

Jesus Christ, Sid! Is everything your responsibility?
Sid, what happened?
I don't know... I felt like... like I was suffocating... Christ, Zack... I was so scared... so godddamn scared...
He's right, Zack. It doesn't matter.
Just like that it's all over? With less than two weeks to go, you're out?
Please, Zack -- go back to the barracks!
I don't get it! He's the best candidate in our class! Ask anyone! The best student! The best leader! The best friend to everybody! Couldn't you bend your goddamn standards just a little?
I don't get it! He's the best candidate in our class! Ask anyone! The best student! The best leader! The best friend to everybody! Couldn't you bend your goddamn standards just a little?
Zack, it wasn't him! He didn't ask me to D.O.R. I came to him on my own. I'm glad it's over, Zack. I really mean that. He was right. I wasn't doing this for me.
What?
A woman and a little girl, both asleep upstairs.
You're fuckin' A we can do this.
Not with me. Not with people.
No problem.
I don't want Raoul to administrate that part.
You're welcome.
Peace out.
What if she called the cops?
She didn't.
What the fuck is funny about this?
God.
God.
There is not one thing funny here.
There is not one thing funny here.
Who else but God could think this shit up? I spend ten years building those fucking rooms to keep people out, now I gotta figure out how to get in. God, man, He just loves the irony.
So what the fuck are we supposed to do?!
Make her come out. And when she does, that's when we gotta be careful. She can't get out of this house. She can't even think she can get out of this house. We just keep them here and keep them quiet for forty-five minutes. And I don't want Joe Pesci here standing over them with his fat sweaty finger on the trigger. That's a
He said open it.
Just sending a message. She'll get the point.
You should see the look on your face.
The fuck did you do that for?!
The fuck did you do that for?!
Fuckin' asshole, thinks he knows me. Drives his German car up to 125th Street a couple of times, buys a few rounds, thinks he's a tough guy, thinks he knows me. You don't know one thing about me!
Stop it! Stop it!
Who's the clown now? Huh?! Who's the fucking clown now?!
Me. I am.
That's right.
That's right.
Burning me. It's burning my eye.
Burning me. It's burning my eye.
I have the gun.

Yes.
Yes.
Remember that.

Please...
What? What do you want me to do?
What do you think? Get us into that room.
What do you think? Get us into that room.
I can't.
You can. You're full of ideas. You just need to squeeze one out.
I can't...
I can't...
You got till the count of three. Then you end up like him.
One. Squeeze.
This is ridiculous...

Two. Squeeze harder.

Okay, okay! Okay.
Okay, okay! Okay.
You got an idea?
You got an idea?
Yeah. Yeah, I got an idea. I gotta check something.
Are you okay?
Hurry up, for Christ's sake!
The hell does she want?
I don't know, she keeps screamin' the same thing over and over.
Yeah, just like a half hour, maybe a little more, and your mom'll give it to you. You can wait a half hour, can't you?
Yeah. She can. She's fine, she's just like, tired, she's gotta rest. You rest, Kid. Half an hour.
You're wasting your fucking time, man, you're wasting my time. You don't know how to do this, and the longer we stay in here, the more likely she's gonna lose it and call the cops!
Are you gonna open the safe?
She's fuckin' crazy, she killed the kid! She just killed her own kid!
It's not her fault, it's not her fault, the guy must have called them. Look, look, look, she's telling us.
She's gonna handle it.
She better.
That's your problem.
That's their problem.
Let me fucking finish this so we can get out of here.
You finish. Then we finish.
-- posed to mean?
You're here with me, you're already on the hook for one. Buy one, you get the rest for the same price. You know that.
You're here with me, you're already on the hook for one. Buy one, you get the rest for the same price. You know that.
Get the fuck away from me.
Get the fuck away from me.
The kid in here. The other two when we come out.
Bullshit.
You know how this gotta end.
The walls are steel, right?
Not that one.
Not that one.
NOT THAT ONE?!
NOT THAT ONE?!
Hey man, it's the neighbor's house, who breaks in through the neighbor's house?!
WHO THE FUCK BREAKS IN THROUGH THE NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE?!
We've got the Kid! WE'VE GOT YOUR KID!! What the fuck is she thinking?!
We've got the Kid! WE'VE GOT YOUR KID!! What the fuck is she thinking?!
She's got your gun, that's what she's thinking! The FUCK you had to bring a gun for?!
YOU KNOW HOW THIS IS GONNA GO!
FUCK YOU, I'M GONE!
Fuck.
I know.
Fuck!
Keep your voice down.

You're an idiot.
Who is this guy?
Raoul is cool. That's all you need to know.
Raoul is cool. That's all you need to know.
This is insane. I'm outta here.
Unless Daddy comes back later.
Daddy's not coming back, she's in the middle of a divorce, it's just the two of them. We're okay, here. We can do this, right?
Forty-five minutes. That's all you said you need. That's like nothing.
She'll call the cops, they'll be here before I get unpacked.
She'll call the cops, they'll be here before I get unpacked.
So we keep an eye on her. Raoul can totally administrate that part.
They won't get hurt.
What about us? What if she has a gun?
What about us? What if she has a gun?
Raoul, what in God's name do we do if she has a gun?

What tables? I've never seen him before.
What tables? I've never seen him before.
Different tables.
Different tables.
The fuck did you bring a gun for?
It's still a good plan. It's just... got a twist.
Yeah. Kidnapping.
Yeah. Kidnapping.
Not if we keep 'em here. You can't kidnap somebody in their own house. It's just breaking and entering, unless we take 'em someplace. Or something like that, I'm pretty sure.

Pure idiot.
Pure idiot.
I am. I'm an idiot's son. An idiot's grandson. I'm third- generation idiot. But for once in my life I had a good idea, and I'm not giving up so easy. You are? Are you actually telling me that for the first time in your life you're gonna throw your cards on the table and go home early? I can't believe my eyes. Fourteen
Got her right where you want her, Junior.
Shut up.
Shut up.
When you said you'd let 'em go I thought she'd come running right out for sure.
When you said you'd let 'em go I thought she'd come running right out for sure.
Shut up and let me think.
I'm afraid to let you think, Junior. Things get worse when you think. Oh, that's gonna help.
Okay, fuckball, you think. What are we gonna do?
She said she did.
She lied. Cops woulda been here by now if she called 'em. Besides, Junior cut the phones.
Yes. Yes, it's all terrible ironic and amusing. You fuck. Now how are you gonna get us into that room?
Can't. Whole point. Can't get in the room.
Open it.
I did.
Be quiet.
We're trying to scare them, not kill them!
We're trying to scare them, not kill them!
They're coughing.
They're coughing.
They're gonna die in there!
They're gonna die in there!
Nobody is gonna die, man, will you please have the balls to follow through with a good idea? Think about it, what would you do if you were them, stay in there and choke to death, or come out?! Huh?

Junior, you gigantic idiot, how are we supposed to get into the room if they pass out?
Cell phone.
Shit!
She's never coming out.
Hey.
Hey.
And we're never getting in.
And we're never getting in.
Do me a favor and don't talk.
Do me a favor and don't talk.
Jesus, what was I thinking?
Hey man, after all we went through I am not walking out when we're this close.
Close? Are you insane? We're nowhere near close! Fuck this, I'll make an anonymous phone call on Monday, they'll find the floor safe, and I'll inherit the shit. Little piece of it, anyway, it's better than nothing.

What about us?
We're not leaving. I'm getting in that room, and I'm opening that safe.
Lookin' doubtful there, Big Guy, but ten out of ten for attitude.
You walk out that door and you lose your share of the money.
Yeah, whatever.
Yeah, whatever.
I mean it!
I mean it!
Adios.
Yeah?
Everything okay?
Everything okay?
Huh?
'Bout four o'clock.
I don't get it.
Somebody called you?
Can we come in?
Can we come in?
What do you want?
What do you want?
We'd like to come in.
We'd like to come in.
No, you can't come in.
Can we come in?
Stop asking me that. I'm fine. Who called you?
Stop asking me that. I'm fine. Who called you?
You don't look so good.
You don't look so good.
You wake me out of a sound sleep at four in the morning and then tell me I look like hell? Of course I look like hell, you don't look so hot yourself, Jack. I'm freezing here, thank you for checking, can I go?
Your husband says you said "There are three..." right before you got cut off.
Oh, that phone call...
May I ask what the rest of that sentence was going to be?
Huh?
Huh?
The sentence that started "There are three." What was the rest?
One day you will learn to respect other people's time, Lydia, one day you --
Evan, I am so sorry, you were a saint to wait for us!
I don't have to tell you there is an acute shortage of living space in Manhattan right now and this is a highly unique property.
No ball, kid.
Third floor, spare bedroom, den, what have you. Mr. Pearlstine used it as an office.
He's talking about Bernard Pearlstine.
Master bath.
The hotel guy? It's been in the papers lately. His kids are all suing each other over his estate. He was a total recluse, paranoid, rich as hell, he was worth thirty million or something, now it turns out they can't find half of it. Somebody took something didn't belong to them!

KID! NO ELEVATOR!
Oh, I've seen these...
It's quite in vogue in high end construction right now. One really can't be too careful about home invasion.
Hey, this is perfect for you... Absolutely! You're a woman, you're living alone now. Your alarm goes off, or you head glass break, or for whatever reason you think someone's broken into your home in the middle of the night. What are you going to do? Call the police and wait until they get here on Tuesday? Traipse downstairs in your sexy little underthings
Reinforced steel core walls. Buried phone line, completely separate, not connected to the house's main line and never exposed throughout the house's infrastructure or outside the house -- you can call the police; nobody can cut you off. Your own ventilation system, complete with oxygen scrubber, so you've got plenty of fresh air for as long as you like. And a bank of video
That door is a safely hazard.
Not at all.
Working elevator. Mr. Pearlstine, the previous owner, was disabled the last ten years of his life. Highly unusual, the elevator, you will not find this in ninety percent of brownstones.
Will they take asking price? I need a two week escrow and I'm already approved for the loan.
A what?
A safe room. An inner sanctum. A castle keep, in medieval times.
Everything's spring-loaded, even if the power's out it's fully functional.
Open it.
That's highly inappropriate.
I said open the door.
Push that button for me, will you?
Don't!
Watch your mouth.
It's okay, Raoul.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. We can still handle this. Can we still handle this?
It's just the woman and the kid?
Cut it back a little bit.
No fucking way.
No fucking way.
He's right, we can't get into the room if they're dead!
We're not gonna do anything about him, he's fine.

That's right, Raoul, it wasn't your idea, none of this was your idea, it was mine, it's my family we're ripping off, it's my prick grandfather who built that fucking room, it was my idea to get the plans, I found the floor safe, and it was my idea to ask a guy who builds these rooms to help break into one! Me, me,

No, you will not, because without Burnham there's no way in hell we're gonna get into that safe, so as far as I'm concerned he can paint your ass blue and run it up a flagpole and you won't lay a finger on him, you understand me?

Little Bobby... Just a kid...
They're hurting us, baby. Huey locked up. Bobby Seale running all over the country holding things together. Cy dead. Little Bobby... I don't recognize half the faces at meetings.

Alma I told you to...
Fuck that, we've got company...
No...
You gotta. You gotta stay alive. You know what they were trying to do here. You got the pigs dead to rights. It's like Huey said, you're more important than any of us.
Okay now, er, Huey, so what's your telephone number?
I have confirmed to you my address, that's all I'm required to by law to do. We have broken no law.

Lemme see that rifle son...
No! This is my private property. According to California law we have a constitutional right to bear arms.
Well... is it loaded?
I tell you "officer", it wasn't...
For the last time Boy!!! What do those guns mean??!!
They mean, Pig!, that the Black Panther Party declares that if you try to brutalize our community or take our weapons. We are going to shoot you!!!
Free? We're back where we started. Shit we still don't have a stop light.
Well as the Rev says, God helps those who help themselves. We'll be our own stoplight.
Well if anyone's gonna protect Malcolm's legacy it better be us.
Damn straight... Let's go check out these Paper Panthers.
This brothers is gonna be a colossal event. We'll shut the mother down right at the capitol, in front of the cameras. Will you cool it? What's up man? What it be Bobby?

What? We're the leadership, you and me. There ain't enough of us to...
What? We're the leadership, you and me. There ain't enough of us to...
That's just it Huey. The pigs don't know how many Panthers there are. Both of us show and they might start putting 2 and 2 together. We're not even two hundred strong yet... but we got 'em guessing thousands.

Sure, those boojie jokers don't do anything except print up a lotta paper saying "Black is Beautiful."
...The police report says he was shot three times but the coroner's report says quite clearly that Denzil Dowell was shot six times. And two of those shots were in his armpits. Brothers and Sisters you know why that is? Because Denzil had his hands up!!
No more police brutality! WHAT DO WE WANT?
Yeah... Sounds like the Constitution to me. With a little of the Bill of Rights thrown in...

What the fuck?
Brimmer! Could you come in here please?
Sit down, This concerns you too. I don't need to say that your department's handling of the Black Panthers -- particularly Inspector Brimmer's "undercover operation" has been a complete travesty.

I hear you. I'll catch you in a bit. Feeling cooped up in there, you know?
Cy... Cy... Oh shit man... who did this to you. Was it the pigs?
N... N...... Not... Oh.
Don't I know it. Come on in Agent Rodgers. Sit down. Always a... pleasure to see you. How can I be of help?
It's a bit more like how can we help you. Bay Area's become quite a hornet's nest in terms of subversive activities. And... well Mr. Hoover wants to reiterate that the FBI will be happy to assist local authorities in any way we can. On a strictly advisory basis... of course.

Of course. Well, I appreciate your offer, but we got things pretty well under control. Same bunch of kooks you guys already have under surveillance. They're still doing a lot of yelling and pot-smoking but nothing to worry about.

Naw... They're kids mostly. Idealists. They actually think they're for real.
Naw... They're kids mostly. Idealists. They actually think they're for real.
Hmmm. As you know the Bureau -- and Mr. Hoover -- is particularly "sensitive" to anything that might agitate or solidify the coloreds on the left.
You want me to put a man on it?
That would be an excellent start. Tell him to keep a low profile.
One: "We want freedom. We want the power to determine the destiny of our Black Community." Two: "We want full employment for our people." Three: "We want to end the robbery by the white man of our Black Community." Christ, they're asking for reparations...
They couldn't have thought this up for themselves.
Now hold on Rodgers...
Chief Dorsett, if the Black Panthers are going to remain in your jurisdiction, some fundamental changes in attitude need to be made...
I want it duly noted, that this operation was entirely under the auspices of the Oakland Police Department. The FBI doesn't have a monopoly on agents infiltrating enemy organizations, my friend. As I've said before, Agent Rodgers, we have things under control in our city...
Are you finished?
Are you finished?
No I'm not. I'd like to say, frankly and off the record, that I resent the Bureau's presence here. "Advisory Basis" or not. And, once we get these boys put away and the Panthers permanently discredited, I'd appreciate it if you'd leave us to take care of our own. Now I'm finished.
These are memos from the commissioner, the mayor and Hoover himself, putting the Black Panthers and their subversive activities under the full jurisdiction of the Bureau.
Jesus...
Jesus...
As far as Mr. Hoover is concerned the worst has happened, the Panthers have unified with other organizations -- most likely sponsored by communists -- to undermine the war in Vietnam. By doing so, they have quite simply guaranteed their own extinction.
Rodgers... this is no good...
Cut the crap, you've been taking the man's money for years. Now it's time you earned it.
To be quite honest it turns my stomach.
Neither your stomach or your opinion matters here Dorsett... What matters is that Mr. Trafficante and the Bureau have come up with a solution to our Panther Problem. One might say...The Final Solution.
I don't think that will be any problem...
You talk as if this thing's already been decided.
But lots of our people don't read, man. They need strong imagery to help them out.
Yeah... then shouldn't this be all of us together.
Yeah... then shouldn't this be all of us together.
Trust me Huey, this picture will be worth a thousand words. Now have you given any thought to that Peace and Freedom Party thing. They really want to hook up with us. Do a rally together. Hell it'd broaden our base of visibility.

Yeah, but aligning with white organizations. I'm not sure now's the time.
Yeah, but aligning with white organizations. I'm not sure now's the time.
The time, my friend, is what Sartre called, "the moment the match is being put to the fuse." Question is, is the hand holding that match gonna be black or white.

...no full fledge alliance. But I think we should do a rally with them. Show that there's some common ground between Black and White. You all with that? All right then Eldridge, set it up.
Yes sir I was.
And did you witness the shoot-out?
And did you witness the shoot-out?
Yes sir, I did.
Yes sir, I did.
From what you saw, did Huey Newton start the shooting?
From what you saw, did Huey Newton start the shooting?
No sir he didn't.
Huh, well then... did someone else start shooting?
I refuse to answer the question on the grounds it might incriminate me.
Did you shoot the officers in question?
Again I'll take the fifth amendment on that question.
...at least that takes Bobby Seale off the street...
Not good enough Rodgers. Not good enough at all. Black terrorists on the floor of a State Capitol. I will not say this again, these Negro Commies are to be stopped and now. You tear them down. Either from the outside or the inside.

We're working on that...
We're working on that...
Work harder. And get me some results. Those Black Bastards could be up to anything.
Granted, the Free Huey thing has become a bit of a rallying cry for the left...
Rallying cry, it's an insurrection. Seale, that god damned Cleaver, Where the hell do these guys come from?
Rallying cry, it's an insurrection. Seale, that god damned Cleaver, Where the hell do these guys come from?
Well... like they say, there's a Panther born every minute in the ghetto. Uh... we seem to have "underestimated" the support of the Black community. It's their power base...
Well, then we're going to take that power away from those bastards.
You mean...
You mean...
Yes, that's exactly what I mean. And Agent Rodgers?... This conversation never occurred.
That's right brother... listen and learn.
The white power structure wants us to act like savages. But we're a different kind of animal altogether. We're Panthers. And The Black Panther Party for Self Defense is very painfully aware that America has historically reserved its most barbaric treatment for non-white people since the beginning of the country. So we need to organize, we keep our shit correct! And effect revolution. We
Shit, nothing but Paper Panthers.
Yeah... but it seems they're bringing Malcolm's widow Betty Shabazz to town, to speak at a rally, do an interview for Ramparts. And they want us to help with security.
We'll get them. Right now we got to worry about being armed and ready to protect Betty Shabazz. Those phonies sure as hell can't. We need guns.
We need money first...
We need money first...
Yeah... Bobby you gotta...
This here's a "Panther Patrol." We see a brother getting busted. We check it out, make sure the pig don't go beating on the man. Brother gets taken downtown, we post bail, hook 'em up with a lawyer.
We're like policing the police.
You're a little old to be a school boy aren't you brother. Cool it! You're probably not the only one they've gone after. Stall a little so they believe you're for real. Make them trust you. Hey Tyrone, you figure feeding our children is gonna make The Man jumpy?
Black people getting uppity, feeding their children breakfast, taking their destiny into their own hands. What's this world coming to?
C'mon let's...
No! Just harassment. Can't let it stop this. Brother we got momentum!
Alright, I'll stay. Judge, I want to...
Where you been? I saw the cops rousting you at the rally.
Huey man I got to talk with you...
So talk...
So talk...
Alone...
Alone...
Look... can we deal with this tomorrow... I'm tired...
Yeah man, but where's Judge?
You know I think Brother Judge needs our support right now, not our suspicion This is beautiful man. Folks around here never read the truth like this before.
That's right. We'd be proud to provide as escort for Malcolm's widow. How many men you got?
Get the brothers a beer. Me too while you're at it. Men? Well we can spare six for security...
Get the brothers a beer. Me too while you're at it. Men? Well we can spare six for security...
No thank you sister. Six?!! That seems a little light. Cops are watching Betty, watching her hard. We need at least twenty men. And that's twenty armed Panthers dig? You do have guns don't you?
No thank you sister. Six?!! That seems a little light. Cops are watching Betty, watching her hard. We need at least twenty men. And that's twenty armed Panthers dig? You do have guns don't you?
I assure you that we as the revolutionary vanguard are as serious about this as you are. We'll be prepared.
We put our lives on the line today. Malcolm X's widow was on the line today. And your guns weren't even loaded.
A gun's a gun man. It don't need to be loaded.
A gun's a gun man. It don't need to be loaded.
Tell that to the pigs. Better yet tell that to Malcolm.
Tell that to the pigs. Better yet tell that to Malcolm.
Wait a second there brother...
Wait a second there brother...
No you wait a second. You and your "Panthers" got three choices. One you join with us and follow our rules. Two you change your name. Or three you face annihilation.
You were. infantry right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
So I guess it's safe to say you know about firepower.
We appreciate your help with this.
So what's the deal?
So what's the deal?
Freedom... We're just gonna test some of the words in that law book.
Judge... we're doing security for Betty Shabazz's visit next week. I'd like to have someone who knows there way around a pistol there. Someone like you.
I don't know.
I don't know.
You are down for protecting Malcolm's widow aren't you?
You are down for protecting Malcolm's widow aren't you?
Yeah... let me think about it.
Yeah... let me think about it.
Okay man I ain't going to push. But remember the revolution isn't going to wait for anyone. Come on, we'll give you a lift.
Okay man I ain't going to push. But remember the revolution isn't going to wait for anyone. Come on, we'll give you a lift.
No man. Gonna walk.
Welcome brother, have you decided to get down with us?
I'm down.
I'm down.
Yeah... You were a lot of help with those guns. Your soldier shit is bad- ass.
Yeah... You were a lot of help with those guns. Your soldier shit is bad- ass.
I'd hoped I was finished with all that. But...
I'd hoped I was finished with all that. But...
You know, you're lucky to be back. Most niggers die on the front lines. Seems like that's what they're there for.
You know, you're lucky to be back. Most niggers die on the front lines. Seems like that's what they're there for.
Don't I know it. Every brother I knew in 'Nam's dead. My company... a land mine. Twenty of my friends dead in less than a second.
Don't I know it. Every brother I knew in 'Nam's dead. My company... a land mine. Twenty of my friends dead in less than a second.
Mind if I ask you something? Why'd you put up with shit like that for someone else's war?
Hey, GI bill pays for school. And shit, if I stuck around here, instead of signing up, I'd probably be in jail, or sitting on the stoop drinking Bitter Dog with Rose, you know?
Yeah I know. You're smart Judge. You ain't no bourgeois nigger like those Paper Panthers across the bay. I need every good man to help us with the security on Betty Shabazz, particularly soldiers. You do solid on that I might have something else for you, something real important.

Whatever you need, I'll be there.
Whatever you need, I'll be there.
Right on Brother Judge...
What it be Judge. Nobody got hurt, Sister Betty's safe. This was a good day...
They were empty...
You were alright Judge, better than alright. You're what the Party needs. A fighter but also one that's going to school not making the man too nervous.
I don't know about that.
I don't know about that.
I do. You think you're smart enough to keep playing the game?
I do. You think you're smart enough to keep playing the game?
What, I don't know how you mean?
What, I don't know how you mean?
See, the thing about Panthers. For all their speed and strength. They are not naturally aggressive. They don't just go out killing, tearing through the jungles murdering. No, the Panther keeps his claws hidden until he is attacked, until he's backed into a corner. Then believe me those claws are fierce.

Huey, you're losing me. What are you talking about?
Huey, you're losing me. What are you talking about?
I'm talking about survival. Yours, mine, all of it. Outside and in. You got to do something for me. Staying alive might depend on it. The pigs are gonna try to infiltrate us and we're gonna let 'em. But their spy's gonna be our spy too. How about it?
Me? You've got a whole lot of other folks signing up. Why me?
You fit the profile, Brother. You look exactly like the kind of nigger they think they can trust...
Aw... uh... it's was just harassment. My driver's license expired.
Chickenshits, they're grabbing at anything.
What's the pig's name?
Brimmer.
Brimmer.
You got to keep very cool on this. Icy god damn cool. Cause baby, you just became the strongest weapon we got. Let me guess, he wants you to call him, tell him what we're doing.

And you're gonna do just that. But I'll tell you what to feed the pig. You alright with this?
And you're gonna do just that. But I'll tell you what to feed the pig. You alright with this?
Yeah... I guess. Any of other Panthers know about this?
Man, this shit's pretty thick.
You got that right. And brother, I got a feeling it's going to get a whole lot thicker.
Listen Judge, Oakland's Panther International Headquarters. We shut the Pig's infiltration down here, they're gonna think twice about running their games on other chapters.
Huey, man who's gonna straighten out the brothers if they get on my ass?
Huey, man who's gonna straighten out the brothers if they get on my ass?
Like the manual says, "Information is...
I don't know man. I don't know. That reminds me. Another little donation from the police.
If the pigs only knew they were subsidizing The Panthers...
If the pigs only knew they were subsidizing The Panthers...
Yeah well, they want a lot for their money. They want a felony, preferably with "violent intent." We've got to give them something. They'll kill me if I don't. And the Panthers are going to kill me if I do. I'm scared.

Me too. That's why I fight so hard.
I saw... but...
But nothing... you do live here don't you?
Yeah, I do.
Well, act like it. Come on.
Don't let the cops provoke you. We're there to watch and take badge numbers...
And who is we?
Shit, we made him get his moms to give permission before he could sign up.
Just a kid.
Just a kid.
Yeah, well, cops kick the shit out of kids too.
I thought you said all the Panthers were gonna be here.
What you see is what you got. That's' Bobby Seale.
You're a smart brother... you should dig what Huey and Bobby got to say...
Maybe...
Maybe...
Fuck maybe... be there.
Busted firing pin. You want only the legal stuff right?
Just the legit shit.
Huh?
He had a feeling you'd be coming by.
What? You don't like to see a traitor get hurt? I wonder why that is?
If you got something to say, say it.
If you got something to say, say it.
Anything happens to Huey it ain't gonna be a finger. I'll...
What's up with you?
Nothing.
Nothing.
You got something on your mind... "brother."
You got something on your mind... "brother."
Yeah, "brother" My best friend is stone dead.
Sorry man...
S'alright. I'm sorry too. Shit, I gotta take a leak... Pull over at that gas station.
Fuck is up?!
Mothafucker! You just set Bobby Seale up to be kidnapped. They dragged him off to some bullshit conspiracy trial in Chicago. How much the pigs pay you for this one, Judge?
You better just kill me Tyrone. And when Huey gets out, when Oakland's just wall to wall junkies, you tell him you blew away the only chance we all got. I'm sure he'll be real happy about that.
What are you saying?
What are you saying?
The pigs are gonna start flooding us with dope. Huey wants us to stop them.

We'll all get out of here together.
Later for that. I'm done either way...
You supposed to be a wounded vet, Motherfucka. What you do in 'Nam anyway, shoot gooks or shoot hoops?
All of the above, man... And then some.

Just come for the food, man. Ain't quite sure what their bag is but...
This cool the heat off you any?
I don't know. But I'm sure I'll find out. Rose, you did me solid.
Unh... Unh Man... I don't take no money from friends that need help. Fuck no. What do you think I am a bum?
Not at all. I'll catch you later.

Flanking riders?
I didn't see any.
These four wagons must be his.
And the dogs, too, I'll wager.
Lord Cornwallis is brilliant. His weakness is that he knows it.
Father?
Father?
Pride is his weakness.
Gabriel? Are you asleep?
We're low on salt. I should go to Pembroke and get some.
Fourteen dead, eleven wounded, eighteen captured.
I should have killed him when I had the chance?

When was that? In the swamp at the expense of your men? Or when he killed Thomas at the expense of your family?
When was that? In the swamp at the expense of your men? Or when he killed Thomas at the expense of your family?
No...
No...
Or perhaps tomorrow at the expense of our cause.
Stay the course... your mother used to say that to me when I'd get drunk or lose my temper.
She'd say it to me when I picked on Thomas or Nathan.

You learned her lessons better than I.

She got me at a more impressionable age.
She spoke? Susan spoke?
Full sentences. As if she had been speaking all along.
Full sentences. As if she had been speaking all along.
I don't believe it... and I wasn't there for it...
She said... she loves you and misses you but she understands why you can't be there with her.
She said that? Oh, my Lord, she said that?
Father, there's something else I need to talk to you about.
What?
What?
Come with me. I'll tell you when we get there.
Sir, I'd like to request a furlough. Two days?
Granted. Where are you going?
Granted. Where are you going?
Cheraw Falls.
Cheraw Falls.
It's beautiful there. Your mother and I were there once, before you were born.
It's beautiful there. Your mother and I were there once, before you were born.
I know.
Tarleton has a list of our men, most are on it. A regiment of dragoons is going to the homes on the list, burning them, killing whomever resists, women and children, as well.
Where?
Where?
Seven homes along the Black River so far...
Don't go in there.
Is it her? Is Anne in there?
Is it her? Is Anne in there?
She is. Don't go in there.
Father, tell me what happened at Fort Wilderness?
You know what happened.
You know what happened.
No, I don't.
No, I don't.
Everyone knows. It's what made me a hero. Me, Harry Lee, all of us. I got a medal. Men bought me drinks. They still do sometimes. Everyone knows what happened.

Tell me what everyone doesn't know.
Tell me what everyone doesn't know.
And what do they know?
And what do they know?
That the French and Cherokees captured the fort and when you retook it, you took revenge on them for what they did during the occupation.
That the French and Cherokees captured the fort and when you retook it, you took revenge on them for what they did during the occupation.
That's right.
That's right.
That's not enough. Tell me.
That's not enough. Tell me.
Your mother asked me the same question around the time you were born. I was drunk and I was foolish enough to answer her.
That's why it was four years between you and Thomas. It took me that long to regain her respect.
I'm not my mother. I can't have the respect without the knowing.
We buried them, then we went to track. It was a cold trail and they were moving fast. We went faster. We caught up to them at Kentucky Ford.
Go on.
Go on.
We took our time with them and gave every one of them worse than they had given at the fort. It was two weeks before they were all dead, all except two. We put the heads on a pallet and had the two we let live take it to the French at Fort Ambercon. The eyes, fingers and tongues we put in a basket
It was a different time, son. And you're a better man than that.
I see, do as I say, not as I do.
I see, do as I say, not as I do.
Yes.
If this war is about more than Thomas, it's about more than Anne, as well. Stay the course.
As you did at Fort Wilderness?
He wanted to, Susan, but he couldn't leave his men.
He left us.
He left us.
I know he did and he's sorry. He'll come back as soon as he can.
There are some letters here from him. Some are just to you.
I don't care. I hate him.
I don't care. I hate him.
You don't hate him.
You don't hate him.
Yes, I do. I hate him and I hope he never comes back.
An American nation. Colonel Lee, with your permission?
Please.
Please.
Those of us who call ourselves Patriots are not seeking to give birth to an American nation, but to protect one that already exists. It was born a hundred-and-seventy years ago at Jamestown, Virginia and has grown stronger and more mature with every generation reared and with every crop sown and harvested. We are a nation and our rights as citizens of that nation

Thank you. Were I an orator, those are the exact words I would have spoken.
Mister Robinson, I fought with Captain Marion in the French and Indian War, including the Wilderness Campaign. We served as scouts under Washington and I have no doubts about Captain Marion's courage or competence on a battlefield. There's not a man in this room, or anywhere, for that matter, to whom I would more willingly trust my life.
I stand corrected.
I stand corrected.
Nonetheless, I would like to know, Mister Marion, how... how... how...
Captain Marion, I understood you to be a Patriot.
It's Mister Marion.

I understood him to be a Patriot as well.
Damn it, Francis! How in God's name do you expect to gain independence without going to war?

A long time ago...

Wars are not fought only by childless men. A man must weigh his personal responsibilities against his principles.
That's what I'm doing. I will not fight and because I won't, I will not cast a vote that will send others to fight in my stead.

We're a breath away from losing this war. In the North, Washington is reeling from Valley Forge, running and hiding from Clinton and twelve thousand Redcoats. Here in the South, Cornwallis has broken our back. He captured over five thousand of our troops when he took Charleston and today he destroyed the only army that stood between him and New York.
So now Cornwallis will head north, link up with Clinton and finish off Washington.
So now Cornwallis will head north, link up with Clinton and finish off Washington.
And Patriots will start dying on the gallows instead of the battlefield. Unless we can keep Cornwallis in the South until the French arrive. A treaty was signed at Versailles after our victory at Saratoga. The French are sending a fleet and ten thousand troops.

No. It's not over yet. Two days ride, Yorktown, Virginia. Washington, the French, Cornwallis and Tarleton. It will end, one way or another. Francis, nothing will replace your sons but helping us will justify their sacrifice.
Goodbye, Francis.
Goodbye, Harry.
And congratulations on the birth of your son.
Thank you. Maybe all of this will buy him some peace.
Thank you. Maybe all of this will buy him some peace.

We could go stay at Aunt Charlotte's farm. She's to the west.

No, there'll be skirmishers on the roads. We're safer here.
Margaret, take William and Susan to the river shed. Hide there. If we're not back by dawn, go up the river to the Richardson's house. They'll take you to your Aunt Charlotte's farm. Nathan, Samuel, and I are going to get Gabriel.
But what about Thomas?

Leave him. Take care of William and Susan.

I heard about your son. I'm sorry.
Thank you.
For what?

I lost another a year ago, Thomas. He was only fifteen.

Francis, tell me about General Cornwallis.
Remember Braddock?
Remember Braddock?
That bad?
That bad?
Worse.
Worse.
Proud, priggish and competent. A very bad combination in an adversary.
If Cornwallis receives news that Clinton is coming, he'll simply hold tight and wait. He'll fight a purely defensive battle and he'll win that.
No, he won't. There are two things you need to know about Cornwallis. First, he is a very proud man, He would rather risk defeat than share a victory. If you give him what he thinks is an out, he'll take it.

Not yet, Thomas.
When?
Seventeen.
But it's already been two years and that's two more years. The war could be over by then.

Father, I saw a post rider at the house.
Thank you. Did you finish the upper field?
Father?
Six-pounders. Lots of them.
Father, you can't let them take him...
Quiet.
Father... I killed those men...
Don't blame yourself, you did what I told you to do.

Who might you be, little Miss?
I'm Ellen Creed and I live at 642 Alden Lane, Dearborn, Michigan. At least, I used to.
I'm Ellen Creed and I live at 642 Alden Lane, Dearborn, Michigan. At least, I used to.
And now you live on Route 9 in Ludlow, and your dad's gonna be the new doctor up to the college, I hear, and I think you're going to be just as happy as a clam here, Ellen Creed.
But where are we going, Mr. Crandall?
You'll see soon enough, hon.
Best never to go climbing on old blowdowns like this, Ellie--sometimes they bite.
Bite?
Bite?
Ayuh.
Do you know what this place is, Ellie? Oh, I know you know it's a boneyard, but a bone ain't nothing and even a whole pile of 'em don't amount to much. Do you know what a graveyard really is?
Well...I guess not.
Well...I guess not.
It's a place where the dead speak, Missy.
What if you can't read what's written on there anymore?
Well, it still says some animal got laid down here after, don't it?
Well, it still says some animal got laid down here after, don't it?
Yes--
They do it to honor the dead, Ellen.
Is that right, dad?
Ellie...God doesn't do things like that. I know you loved y'brother, but--
He can if He wants to. He can do anything, just like Inspector Gadget on TV. But I have to keep things ready for him, that's what I think. I've got his picture and I'm going to sit in his chair--
It's gorgeous!
Am I really gonna have my own room?
Yes, but the rope might be--
Yaay!
Honey, Church will be fine.
But what if he dies and has to go to the Pet Sematary?
I want to fly it! Can I fly it now, mommy!
In a minute, hon. Let Gage finish his turn.
Paxcow says it's almost too late!
Ellie...Ellie...what...
Ellie...Ellie...what...
Paxcow says it's almost too late! We have to go back! Paxcow says it's almost too late!
Paxcow says Daddy's going to do something really bad. He--
Who is this Paxcow? Is he like the boogeyman?
Who is this Paxcow? Is he like the boogeyman?
He's a ghost. But he's a good ghost.
There are no ghosts, Ellie. I want you to go to sleep and forget all this nonsense.
Will you at least call and make sure daddy's okay?
Will you at least call and make sure daddy's okay?
Of course I will.
Please hurry.
I will. Come and kiss me.
Yes.
Yaay!
Hurrts! It hurrrrts!
Anyone who can scream that loud isn't ready for intensive care just yet-- looks like she just skinned her knee.
No-I guess not.
Yayyy!
Have you got a death-wish, Ellen?
Well, I thought it was safe--
I want to look around, daddy-- may I?
For a little while.
And that someone cared enough about that animal to mark the spot.
To remember.
That's what I think. I heard Missy Dandridge tell Mom when Church was fixed he wouldn't cross the road so much.
Well, it's always better to take precautions--but I'm sure Church will be all right, honey...
In the end he's gonna croak, isn't he?
Lovey...Church might be still alive when you're in a high school...and that's a very long time.
Lovey...Church might be still alive when you're in a high school...and that's a very long time.
It doesn't seem long to me. It seems short. I think the whole thing about pets dying s-s-sucks!
Good God! Where'd you hear that?
Missy Dandridge. And she says it's a operation!
Yeah, I know...how are things out there in Chicagoland?
Fine...except when Mom was airing Gage's diaper rash, he walked away and got into Grampa's study and pooped in Grampa's favorite chair.
Yes...I guess so. He was sleeping on the front porch when I left.
Cause I had a bad dream about him. I dreamed he got hit by a car and you and Mr. Crandall buried him in the Pet Sematary.
Is he really all right?
Yes.
Yes.
Because you promised.
Because you promised.
I know.
I've noticed it, too. I'll cough up the money, Ellen.
I hate that smell.
She's in bed. She was throwing up. Ever since Mrs. Rogers called and said Missy--
That's enough, Ellen.
Ellie? What's wrong?
No more chocolate chip cookies.
No more chocolate chip cookies.
Huh?
Huh?
Missy made the best chocolate chip cookies in the world--even Mom said so. Now there won't be any more because she's gonna be dead forever!
What's up, sugar?
Daddy, do you think Missy Dandridge went to heaven?
At school Michael McDowell said she was gonna fry in hell. Michael McDowell says all sewersides fry in hell.
Well, I think Michael McDowell is so full of shit he probably squeaks when he walks, my dear.
But don't you dare say that.
I won't...is Missy in heaven, do you think?
I won't...is Missy in heaven, do you think?
I don't know, honey. Different people believe all sorts of different things happen to us when we die. Some believe in heaven or hell. Some think we're born again as little children--
I don't know, honey. Different people believe all sorts of different things happen to us when we die. Some believe in heaven or hell. Some think we're born again as little children--
Sure, carnation. Like in that movie you rented, Audrey Rose.

Well, it's actually reincarnation, but you get the idea. And some people think we just wink out...like a candle flame when the wind blows hard.
Well, it's actually reincarnation, but you get the idea. And some people think we just wink out...like a candle flame when the wind blows hard.
Do you believe that?
I think we go on. I'm not sure what happens after we die, but yeah-- I have faith in that.
You believe in it.
You believe in it.
Oh, faith's a little more than just believing.
I don't get it.
Well, here we are, sitting in my chair. Do you think my chair will be here tomorrow?
Well, here we are, sitting in my chair. Do you think my chair will be here tomorrow?
Yeah, sure.
Yeah, sure.
Then you have faith in that. But we don't know it will be; after all, some crazed chair-burglar might break in while we're away and steal it, right?
I'm not tired!
I'm sure you're not.
I'm sure you're not.
Then why do I have to go to bed?
Then why do I have to go to bed?
Because your mother and I need the rest, sugar. Now buzz.
Ellie--
And I'm going to eat his breakfast cereal, too, even though it tastes like boogers. And...and...
Be good to your mother, darlin'. She needs you.
Come with us, daddy. Please come with us!
Come with us, daddy. Please come with us!
I'll be there in three days--four at the most. I've got to get the electricity shut off and square things with your school so the truant officer ain't after you, and--
Do you swear?
I swear.
Jud Crandall. I live just across the road.
I'm Rachel. Thanks again for saving the wandering minstrel boy, here.
I'm Rachel. Thanks again for saving the wandering minstrel boy, here.
No harm, no foul. But you want to watch out for that road. Those damn trucks go back and forth all day and most of the night.
Excuse me, Mr. Crandall--I've got to change this kid. It's nice to meet you.
Same here. Come over and visit when you get the chance.
How can you call it a good thing? A graveyard for pets killed in the road! Built and maintained by broken- hearted children!
Well, but Missus Creed! It ain't quite that way, deah!
No--but if he drops by, I'll tell him to call you.
Jud, do you remember the name of the student that died on Louis's first day at work? The one that was hit by a car?
Was it Pascow?
Ayuh, I think 'twas. If I see Louis come home before I go to bed, I'll tell him to--
Ayuh, I think 'twas. If I see Louis come home before I go to bed, I'll tell him to--
Don't bother. I'm coming home.
Hey--they actually found the place!
Movin' in's mighty thirsty work. I usually sit out on my porch of an evening and pour a couple of beers over m'dinner. Come on over and join me, if you want.

Well, maybe I----
You need a glass?
Not at all.
Not at all.
Good for you.
God, that's fine.
Ain't it just? The man who invented beer, Louis, that man was having a prime day for himself.
Ain't it just? The man who invented beer, Louis, that man was having a prime day for himself.
What were you listening to?
What were you listening to?
Allman Brothers.
Allman Brothers.
What?
What?
The Eat A Peach album. God, they were good before drugs and bad luck caught up with them. Listen to this, Louis.
Nice.
I like rock and roll. No...I guess that's too mild. I love it. Since my ears started to die out on me, it's the only music I can really hear. And since my wife died...I dunno, some- times a little rock and roll fills up night. Not always, but sometimes. One more time--welcome to Ludlow. Hope your time here will be a happy one.
The one that goes into the woods--sure.
That road--and those Orinco trucks-- are the two main reasons it's there.
That road--and those Orinco trucks-- are the two main reasons it's there.
What's at the end of it?
You folks ready to go on?
Sure.
Who owns the woods up ahead? Paper companies?
Nope. The Micmac Indians. What's up ahead is all that's left of their tribal lands.
Not yet...how much further is it?
Aw, you'll be okay. Less than a mile.
I can hardly read these.
Ayuh--they get older as you go toward the middle. Pete LaVasseur's dog is buried there... the Stoppard boys' racing pigeon that Missus Cowley's cat got...and I think that's the cat himself right there, although it's been so many years I can't tell for sure. Missy Ellen! Come over here just a minute!
No--not right out loud. Their stones speak...or their markers. Even if the marker ain't nothing but a tin can someone wrote on with a Magic Marker, it speaks. Ain't that so, Louis?
I think it is so, Ellie.
My wife is not crazy about cemeteries of any kind. As you may have noticed.
Me neither. But I believe in knowing your enemy.
Did you tell me Rachel took the kids back to Chicago for a few days?
For Ellie's birthday, yes. I didn't go because her old man thinks I'm a shit and the feeling is heartily re- ciprocated...they'll be back tomorrow night. Jud, what's this about?
For Ellie's birthday, yes. I didn't go because her old man thinks I'm a shit and the feeling is heartily re- ciprocated...they'll be back tomorrow night. Jud, what's this about?
Well, there's a dead cat over here on the edge of my lawn, Louis. I think it might be your daughter's.
Well, there's a dead cat over here on the edge of my lawn, Louis. I think it might be your daughter's.
Church? Oh. Oh, Jesus.
It's Church.
I'm sorry. At least it don't look like he suffered.
I'm sorry. At least it don't look like he suffered.
Ellie will, though. She'll suffer plenty.
Loved that cat pretty well, didn't she?
Yes.
Bagged cat. What a mess.
You going to bury him in the Pet Sematary?
Going to tell Ellie?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Seems like you told me about a promise you made--
No need to apologize.
Maybe when they call I'll just tell Ellie I haven't seen the damn cat around. You know?
Jud, this is crazy. It's going to be almost dark before we get back.
It's going to be dark before we even get where we're going, Louis. But we can do it...and we're going to.
It's going to be dark before we even get where we're going, Louis. But we can do it...and we're going to.
But--
But--
Does she love the cat?
Does she love the cat?
Yes, but--
Yes, but--
Then come on.
What say, Louis?
Nothing. Do we plant him on the outer circle or start a new one?
Nothing. Do we plant him on the outer circle or start a new one?
We're still not where we're going.
What do you mean?
The place we're going is on the other side of that.
We can't climb over that. We'll break our necks!
No. We won't. I have climbed it a time or two before, and I know all the places to step. Just follow me...move easy...don't look down...and don't stop. If you stop, you'll crash through for sure.
No. We won't. I have climbed it a time or two before, and I know all the places to step. Just follow me...move easy...don't look down...and don't stop. If you stop, you'll crash through for sure.
I'm not climbing that.
I'm not climbing that.
Give me the cat. I'll take care of it myself.
No, you shouldn't have stopped. But you got away with it. Important thing is are you sure you're all right?
Yes. Where are we going, Jud?
Yes. Where are we going, Jud?
You'll see before long. Let's go.
Micmacs used to call it Little God Swamp.
Is there quicksand?
Is there quicksand?
Ayuh.
There's a lot of funny things down this way, Louis.
You're telling me.
It's funny, all right.
Just don't stop, Louis. You don't ever want to stop down here in Little God. And you don't ever want to look behind you, whatever you hear.
Almost there, Louis.
You keep saying that.
You keep saying that.
This time I mean it.
This was their burying ground, Louis.
Whose burying ground?
Whose burying ground?
The Micmac Indians. I brought you here to bury Ellen's cat.
The Micmac Indians. I brought you here to bury Ellen's cat.
Why? For God's sake, why?
Why? For God's sake, why?
I had my reasons, Louis. We'll talk later. All right?
I had my reasons, Louis. We'll talk later. All right?
I guess so...but...
I guess so...but...
You want to rest a bit before you start?
You want to rest a bit before you start?
No, I'm okay. Will I really be able to dig him a grave? The soil looks thin.
No, I'm okay. Will I really be able to dig him a grave? The soil looks thin.
Soil's thin, all right. But you'll manage.
What are those for?
Your cairn.
Doesn't look like they last long.
Don't worry about that.
Don't worry about that.
Jud, why am I doing all this?
Jud, why am I doing all this?
Because it's right.
But--
No buts! Accept what's done, Louis. What we done was right. Another time it might not be, but tonight it was... at least I hope to Christ it was. Now you make your call...but not a word about tonight.
I most generally don't start before noon, but this looks like an exception.
What did we do, Jud?
What did we do, Jud?
Why, saved a little girl from being unhappy...that's all. Drink up, Louis!
I tried to tell myself I buried him alive. You know--Edgar Allan Poe meets Felix the Cat. But...
Wouldn't wash?
Wouldn't wash?
No. I'm a doctor. I know death when I see it, and Church was dead. He smells horrible and he uses his claws, but he's alive...and I feel like I'm going crazy. It was that place, wasn't it?
No. I'm a doctor. I know death when I see it, and Church was dead. He smells horrible and he uses his claws, but he's alive...and I feel like I'm going crazy. It was that place, wasn't it?
Ayuh. It was the rag-man told me about the place--Stanley Bouchard. Us kids just called him Stanny B. He was half Micmac himself.
Can I have another one?
I guess it wouldn't hurt.
They buried their dead and for a long time their dead stayed buried. Then something happened. Half the tribe died in a season. The rest moved on. They said a Wendigo had soured the ground.
Wendigo?
Wendigo?
Spirit of the north country. Not a good spirit. Wendigos are great liars and tricksters, according to the stories. And if one touches you...
You and this old Indian rag-man--
Stanny B. did for me what I did for you last night, Louis. Only I wasn't alone when Spot came back.
Well, she was a little upset at first, and that's why I thought you ought to hold your peace when you talked to your people last night...you did, didn't you, Louis?
Yes.
