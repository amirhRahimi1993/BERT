You know what you just signed, Jeanne? You just signed away my existence... For you I'm a lie, an illusion. You see? In the end, you were the one who abandoned me...
No...
You think you are ready now?
Yes, my lord.
Yes, my lord.
Let's see.
You know I'm always happy to see you, Jeanne, but to keep coming here twice, three times a day...
I need to confess.
I need to confess.
But you already confessed this morning...
But you already confessed this morning...
I need to confess again.
I need to confess again.
So... alright. What terrible sin have you committed since then that can't wait till tomorrow to be forgiven?
I saw a poor monk without shoes so I gave him some.
There's no sin in charity, Jeanne.

They weren't my shoes. Mine were too small.
They weren't my shoes. Mine were too small.
Whose were they?

My father's.

I'm sure he'll forgive you.
I'm sure he'll forgive you.
He already did, but I want God to forgive me too.
He already did, but I want God to forgive me too.
Jeanne -- if we were to ask forgiveness all the time, we'd spend our whole life in church.

Is that bad?

Well no, but... Jeanne, are you happy at home?

And your mother -- everything's fine with her?

Oh yes, she's... wonderful.
Good, good. And your sister... Catherine -- she's still your best friend?
Oh yes, my sister's just... she's... wonderful.
And what about your other friends... you don't like playing with them?
Oh yes, I play with them... lots...
So... everything sounds... wonderful?
Yes, it is.
Yes, it is.
Then... why are you here so often?

I feel safe here. And it's where I can talk to him.

Well, I try and talk to him, but mostly he's the one who does the talking.

Who is this "he"?

He never says his name.
He never says his name.
What... does he... look like?
Beautiful.
And what does he say to you?
He says... he says I must be good... and help everyone... and take care of myself. Do you think he's coming from the sky?
Perhaps... but wherever he comes from, I think you should listen to him, because it sounds like he's giving you very good advice.
I heard about your sister, and I... understand your pain...
Why did she have to die?
Why did she have to die?
Only God knows the answer to that.
Only God knows the answer to that.
I know Jesus says to love our enemies but I can't -- I just want the English to burn in hell for ever and ever!

I realize your anger, Jeanne, but we must learn to forgive. It's hard, but revenge will never bring about peace.
I realize your anger, Jeanne, but we must learn to forgive. It's hard, but revenge will never bring about peace.
Then what will? And what will bring her back? And why did she have to die in the first place instead of me? Why didn't he take my life instead of hers? It was my fault -- I was late -- she gave me her hiding place...!!
Then what will? And what will bring her back? And why did she have to die in the first place instead of me? Why didn't he take my life instead of hers? It was my fault -- I was late -- she gave me her hiding place...!!
Jeanne... calm down...! Calm down, Jeanne!
I don't want to wait for his call.
Jeanne, be patient.

I want to be with him always...

Soon you'll be able to take the Holy Mass, and as you eat of his flesh and drink of his blood, you will be at one with him.

I want to be at one with Him now.
I'm sorry, Mr Wladek, he wants you to stop.
Who wants me to stop?
Why are you here, Mr. Wladek?
It's like this... I...we...all of them.
Someone you know?
Yes.
A beauty. Who is she?
A singer. Her husband's an actor. I knew them well. Good people. I'd like to talk to her.
A singer. Her husband's an actor. I knew them well. Good people. I'd like to talk to her.
Don't forget, Mr. Wladek, they hang them for helping Jews.
This is my husband. Wladyslaw Szpilman. Marek Gebczynski sent him.
Oh, yes. I remember.
I'm going to get a doctor.
You can't, it's too dangerous.
You can't, it's too dangerous.
I'll get Dr Luczak, we can trust him.

My name's Dorota, I'm Jurek's sister. oh! You're bleeding.
My name's Dorota, I'm Jurek's sister. oh! You're bleeding.
It's nothing.
I nagged Jurek for weeks and weeks. And at last he gave in and said, 'All right, come with me tomorrow,' and so I came and they bombed the station.
You know something? Meeting you like that was absolutely wonderful.
You know something? Meeting you like that was absolutely wonderful.
Really?
Really?
Yes! It was...it was unforgettable.
I've always loved your playing, Mr. Szpilman.
Wladek, please.
Wladek, please.
No one plays Chopin like you.
Oh, Mr Szpilman, you're quite... quite wonderful.
Wladek, please.
Dorota!
I didn't want to come, I didn't want to see all this, but I couldn't stop myself.
I didn't want to come, I didn't want to see all this, but I couldn't stop myself.
How are you doing?
How are you doing?
Fine, no, not really, they arrested my cousin, but Jurek says they'll let him out. This is disgraceful.

Don't worry, it won't last long.

That's what I said, it's so - it's too absurd!

I've been in hiding. I need somewhere to stay.
I've been in hiding. I need somewhere to stay.
He'll be here soon.
How long have you been married?
Just over a year.
And how's Yurek?
Dead.
When's your baby due?
Christmas. This is not a good time to have children. But then...
What did I tell you?
What are you doing?
Will I still be able to play?
Let's find out.
Let me see this.
Doesn't it say we have to provide these armbands ourselves? Where will we get them?
To tell you the truth, I thought it would be worse.
How will we sleep?
For what? For my tie?
American Jews, and there's lots of them, what have they done for us? What do they think they're doing? People here are dying, haven't got a bite to eat. The Jewish bankers over there should be persuading America to declare war on Germany!
It's not going to be very comfortable.
I'll be fine.
I'll be fine.
You'll have to stay here until tomorrow afternoon.
Must feel better this side of the wall.
Yes, but sometimes I'm still not sure which side of the wall I'm on.
Yes, but sometimes I'm still not sure which side of the wall I'm on.
Here.
Get your things together, you have to leave!
What's happened?
I'm on the run!
What's happened?
What's happened?
The Gestapo found our weapons. They've arrested Janina and Andrzej. They're bound to find out about this place, too - you must get away at once.

Where do you want me to go? Look at me. No, no, I'm not leaving. Can't I take my chances here?
Where do you want me to go? Look at me. No, no, I'm not leaving. Can't I take my chances here?
That's your decision. But when they storm the flat, throw yourself out of die window - don't let them get you alive. I have poison on me, they won't get me alive either!
Have you seen this?
What, I'm working, what?
What's happened?
Oh my God, it's terrible, you've got to do something, oh my God!
Oh my God, it's terrible, you've got to do something, oh my God!
Calm down, what, what is it?
Calm down, what, what is it?
They're hunting people on the streets. They've picked up Henryk.
Halina?
What?
What?
Funny time to say this.
Funny time to say this.
What?

wish I knew you better.

Thanks.
Henryk's in there.

Yitzchak, they told me you had influence.

Who told you?

People I know. They said you're an important man.
We're recruiting.
Who's recruiting?

Don't be clever with me, Henryk. I've come here as a friend. They're bringing Jews in from all over the country. Soon there'll be half a million people in the ghetto. We need more Jewish police...
Don't be clever with me, Henryk. I've come here as a friend. They're bringing Jews in from all over the country. Soon there'll be half a million people in the ghetto. We need more Jewish police...
Oh? More Jewish police? You mean you want me to wear a cap like yours, beat up Jews with my truncheon and catch the Gestapo spirit. I see!

Someone's got to do it, Henryk.

But why me? I thought you only recruited boys with rich fathers. Look at my father, look at us, I mean...
But why me? I thought you only recruited boys with rich fathers. Look at my father, look at us, I mean...
Yes, I'm looking at you and that's why I'm here. Your whole family can have a better life. You want to go on struggling for survival, selling books on the street?
Yes, I'm looking at you and that's why I'm here. Your whole family can have a better life. You want to go on struggling for survival, selling books on the street?
Yes, please.
Yes, please.
I'm doing you people a favour. And what about you, Wladek? You're a great pianist. And we've got an excellent police jazz band. They'd welcome you with open arms. Join us. You've got no work...
And suppose they take the table away?
What d'you mean, take the table away?
What d'you mean, take the table away?
The Germans go into Jewish homes and they just take what they want, furniture, valuables, anything.
The Germans go into Jewish homes and they just take what they want, furniture, valuables, anything.
Do they?
What's this about?
Sit down, have tea, I'll start lunch when the girls get back.
And, please, tonight, for once, I don't want anything bad talked about. Let's enjoy our meal.
Okay, then I'll tell you something funny. You know who I mean by Dr. Raszeja.
Henryk, I said nothing bad.
What's the matter with you all? Have you lost your sense of humour?
Boys, boys...
Your work, yes, playing the piano for all the parasites in the ghetto, they don't give a damn about people's sufferings, they don't even notice what's going on around them!
They bombed us, we're off the air.
Warsaw's not the only radio station.
Mama, that was a great dinner.
It certainly was.
No, no. Listen, I've been thinking --
That makes a change.
That makes a change.
You know what we do? We use psychology.

We leave the money and the watch on the table. And we cover it like this. In full view. The Germans will search high and low, I promise you, they'll never notice it.

Just shut up.
But...they won't get all of us... we'll...it's too small...there's four hundred thousand of us in Warsaw!
No. Three hundred and sixty thousand, so it'll be easy.
You sell anything?
Just one. Dostoevsky. The Idiot. Three zlotys.

Three lousy zlotys. And there are people here making millions.

I know.
I know.
You don't know, believe me. They bribe the guards. The guards turn a blind eye. They're bringing in cartloads, food, tobacco, liquor, French cosmetics, and the poor are dying all around them and they don't give a damn.
It's not funny.
Well, you know what's funny? You're funny with that ridiculous tie.
Well, you know what's funny? You're funny with that ridiculous tie.
What are you talking about, my tie? What's my tie got to do with anything? I need the tie for my work.
You go to Heller, did I ask you to talk to him?
You're out, aren't you?
Did you beg, did you grovel to that piece of shit, that cockroach?
I didn't grovel, I asked him to help.
I didn't grovel, I asked him to help.
What did you pay him?

You're mad, that's your trouble, you're mad.
You're mad, that's your trouble, you're mad.
That's also my business.
What's the matter? Are you sick?
Hungry.
What's that mean, no employment certificate?
You have to have an employment certificate to work for one of the German firms in the ghetto, otherwise...

Otherwise what?
Otherwise what?
You'll be deported.
What are you reading?
'If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?'
Very appropriate.
Yes, that's why I brought it.
No one thought they'd hold out so long.
should never have come out. I should've stayed there, fought with them.

Wladek, stop that. It's over now. Just be proud it happened. My God, did they put up a fight.
Wladek, stop that. It's over now. Just be proud it happened. My God, did they put up a fight.
Yes, so did the Germans.

They're in shock. They didn't expect it. Nobody expected it. Jews fighting back? Who'd have thought?

Yes, but what good did it do?
Yes, but what good did it do?
What good? Wladek, I'm surprised at you. They died with dignity, that's what good it did. And you know something else? Now the Poles will rise. We're ready. We'll fight, too. You'll see.
Ah, here. Today's news from the other side.
You're amazing, Jehuda.
You're amazing, Jehuda.
No, I'm a socialist. I have brothers everywhere. They bring me news and food. We care about our fellow human beings. Workers of the world unite.

I don't know why I come here every evening, it's always such bad news.
I don't know why I come here every evening, it's always such bad news.
Bad news, you crazy? You have no world view, Wladek, that's your trouble. The news couldn't be better. The moment Hitler invaded Russia, I knew we'd be all right. Remember Napoleon. Same business. The Germans will freeze to death, please God.
Jehuda, give me something to do.
You're an artist, Wladek, you keep people's spirits up. You do enough.
You're an artist, Wladek, you keep people's spirits up. You do enough.
But I want to help, I want to.
But I want to help, I want to.
You're too well known, Wladek. And you know what? You musicians don't make good conspirators. You're too...too musical.
There are notices going up. The city's to be cleansed of undesirables.
There are always notices going up.
Five hundred. You know how many people on average read one copy? Twenty. That makes ten thousand readers. These will start the uprising. Majorek hides them in his underpants. And leaves them in toilets.
Toilets?
I thought you'd be off on tour, playing London, Paris, New York?
Not this week.
I have to say you look terrible. What's the trouble?
You've heard the rumours they're going to resettle us in the East?

Wladek! How are you?
Fine, we're fine, thank you, and you?
Fine, we're fine, thank you, and you?
Fine, we're fine in the circumstances. But I can guess what you've called about. There's nothing we can do; they won't reopen the station--

Yes, I know, but Jurek, Jurek...
Yes, I know, but Jurek, Jurek...
...not even music, nothing, no radios for the Poles. But I'm sure you'll find work, Wladek, a pianist like you.
...not even music, nothing, no radios for the Poles. But I'm sure you'll find work, Wladek, a pianist like you.
Maybe, maybe not, but, Jurek, don't be offended, I didn't call to discuss my future career.
Puppydog, what d'you mean, you forgot?

Liar, you fell asleep. Pig!
How long have you been here?
Since last night. I was pleased to see you.
They're going to start the final resettlement now. We know what it means. We sent someone out. Zygmunt. A good man. His orders were to follow the trains out of Warsaw. He got to Sokolow. A local railwayman told him the tracks are divided, one branch leading to Treblinka. He said every day freight trains carrying people from Warsaw forked to Treblinka and returned
If you need help...
Have a favour to ask. I want to get out of here.
It's easy to get out, it's how you survive on the other side that's hard.
It's easy to get out, it's how you survive on the other side that's hard.
I know. But last summer, I worked for a day in Zelazna Brama Square. I saw someone I knew. A singer. Her husband's an actor. They're old friends. I've written their names down. And their address. If they're still there. Janina Godlewska and Andrzej Bogucki. Good people. Majorek, you go into the town every day. Would you try and make contact? Ask them if
I tried your friends. They're not at that address any more. But.
You made contact?
You made contact?
Be ready to leave in two days' time. Same place as last night.
Thank God - Wladek! You're wounded.
It's a little cut, nothing.
It's a little cut, nothing.
I've been worried sick.
Pack, darling, get your things, pack.
Where are we going?
Where are we going?
Out of Warsaw.
Out of Warsaw.
Out of Warsaw. Where?
And what do you think you'll do while you're setting up a new line of defence? Wander round lugging your suitcases?
Pack, Wladek, there's no time.
Pack, Wladek, there's no time.
I'm not going anywhere.
No, no, no, I'm staying put. If I'm going to die, I prefer to die at home.
God forbid!
I'm sorry, I did my best, I thought the certificates would save us all.
Stop it, Wladek.
You don't remember me, Mr. Szpilman?
No, I don't think so?
No, I don't think so?

Warsaw Radio. I was a technician. I saw you almost every day.
Sorry, I don't remember.
Sorry, I don't remember.
Doesn't matter. You've nothing to worry about. I'll visit often.
You don't want to worry about that. My grandfather was jilted by his girl friend when he got jaundice. In my opinion, jaundice is not very serious. Drink up.
Why didn't you come sooner? It's been over two weeks.
What the hell are you doing?
I was... I was trying to open this tin.

Show me.
What's all that gunfire?
The Russians. On the other side of the river. All you have to do is hang on for a few more weeks.
What's happening?
We're getting out.
Are the Russians here?
Not yet.
I don't know how to thank you.
Don't thank me. Thank God. It's His will that we should survive. Well. That's what we have to believe.
What about you?
I've got another one. Warmer. What will you do when it's all over?
I've got another one. Warmer. What will you do when it's all over?

Well you stopped combing your hair, which is a good thing, it was looking over done. You see these are the slits that the heads will go through, show him Nessie ... they'll be dead, the Reverend is going to use animal blood, no doubt it will be very dramatic. Tea!
It will be very dramatic.
I can't imagine a fate worse than being dumb. Turn around.
To be deaf?

Oh yes, dear too - TERRIBLE! AWFUL!"'
Ohhh, it's so dark, it's like a dank cave.
Yes, like a cave.
Yes, like a cave.
Ohh no, it makes my skin creep!
We have just come from George Banes' and they have taken him over. It is no wonder he is leaving, he has got in too deep with the natives. They sit on his floor as proud as Kings, but without a shred of manners.
... without a shred of manners.
What would you think if someone played a kitchen table like it were a piano?
Like it were a piano?
Like it were a piano?
It's strange isn't it? I mean it's not a piano, it doesn't make any sound.
I knew she was mute, but now I'm thinking it's more than that. I'm wondering if she's not brain affected.
No sound at all?
No sound at all?
No, it was a table.
No, it was a table.
Well, she was very violent with the gown. She tore off a chunk of lace. if hadn't been there I'd have sworn she'd used her teeth
Oh, yes, yes of course, a concern.
There is something to be said for silence
There is something to be said for silence
Oh indeed. Cotton'.
And with time she will, I'm sure, become affectionate.
Certainly, there is nothing so easy to like as a pet and they are quite silent.
How are the lessons going? ADA nods enthusiastically. He's getting on all right? ADA nods again Good.
That is good, yes.
He is quite altered, as if they had been trying some native witchcraft on him. Well tomorrow or the day after he will be gone.
Baines is packing up?
Baines is packing up?
Well he has NOTHING to pack, but he is leaving. And it is just as well; Nessie has foolishly grown an affection for him ... we have had some tears
My REAL father was a famous German composer

And a packing company, a chain of Savings and Loans and half the politicians in Chicago and New York. There ain't a fix in the world gonna cool him out if he blows on ya.

I'll take him anyway.
I'll take him anyway.
Why?
Why?
'Cause I don't know enough about killin' to kill him.
You can't do it alone, ya know. It takes a mob of guys like you and enough money to make 'em look good.
We'll get by without 'em.
We'll get by without 'em.
This isn't like playin' winos on the street. You gotta do more than outrun the guy.

You gotta keep Lonnegan's con, even after you spent his money. And no matter how much you take from his, he'll get more.

You're sacred of 'em, aren't ya?
You're sacred of 'em, aren't ya?
Right down to my socks, turkey. If I'da been half as scared a that lop-ear, I wouldn't a fallen asleep on 'em. Lonnegan might kill me, but at least he won't bore me to death.

Then you'll do it?
Then you'll do it?
If I can find a mob that'll risk it. But no matter what happens, I don't want you comin' back to me halfway through and sayin' it's not enough... cause it's all you got.
He's not as tough as he'd like to think.
Neither are we.
He's waitin' for you in the card room.
Let him wait.
You just worry about your end, kid.
If we ever get to it.
How'd ya do?
Well we got some workin' money anyway.
Everything go all right?
Yeh, it was easy.
No signs of trouble?
What do ya mean?
What do ya mean?
You know, somebody tailin' ya. A torpedo or somethin'.
You know, somebody tailin' ya. A torpedo or somethin'.
No, not a thing.
How 'bout Lonnegan?
I gave him the breakdown just like ya told me to.
I gave him the breakdown just like ya told me to.
And?
And?
He threatened to kill me.
He threatened to kill me.
Hell, they don't do that and you know you're not gettin' through to 'em.
Then he drove me home. He tried to put himself away as legit, so I went right into the pitch.
Did he hold you up on anything?
You think he'll show?
Did he say he wouldn't?
Did he say he wouldn't?
No.
No.
He'll show.
Why didn't you tell me about Snyder before?
I thought I'd lost him.
Well you found him again and we're gonna have to do somethin' about it. What else haven't ya been tellin' me?
Nothin'. I told ya everything there is.
Nothin'. I told ya everything there is.
Then why'd ya move outa your room?
Then why'd ya move outa your room?
It was too noisy.
It was too noisy.
You can't play your friends like marks, Hooker.
You know how easy it'd be for one of Lonnegan's guys to nail you?
All we need is a couple days, Henry. A couple days and we'll get Lonnegan down and stomp on 'em.
All we need is a couple days, Henry. A couple days and we'll get Lonnegan down and stomp on 'em.
You just won't learn, will ya. Hell, you come in here, I teach you stuff maybe five guys in this world know, stuff most grifters couldn't do even if they knew it, and all you wanna do is run down a bullet. You're just like all them new jerks. Lotsa nerve and no brains. And ten years from now when me and the others

A couple days; that's all I'm askin'. I can stay clear that long.
Christ, they'll probably miss you and hit me.
What's the matter, kid? You're not sayin' much.
Just a little nervous, that's all.
Just a little nervous, that's all.
Luther always told me to bite my toenails when I get nervous. You see yourself doin' that and you realize it ain't worth it.
Take it easy, you won't lose him now. We had him 10 years ago when he decided to be somebody. Believe me, I've seen enough to know.
How many guys you conned in your life, Henry?
How many guys you conned in your life, Henry?
Two or three hundred I guess. Sometimes played two a day when I was in Shea's mob. We had it down to a business. 'Course Chicago was a right town then. The fix was in. The dicks took their end without a beef. All the Wall Street boys wanted to make investments for us. Even had marks looking us up, thinkin' they could beat
I better do some packin'. I'm gonna be a hot number again after tomorrow.
Then why you doin' it?
Then why you doin' it?
Seems worthwhile, doesn't it? Maybe it's just for the cave-in on Lonnegan's face when we put in the sting.
Henry.
Yeh.
Yeh.
I appreciate your stickin' your neck out. I wouldn't have asked ya if it weren't for Luther.
I appreciate your stickin' your neck out. I wouldn't have asked ya if it weren't for Luther.
Ain't nothin' gonna make up for Luther, kid. Revenge is for suckers. I been griftin' 30 years and never got any.
You beat him, kid.
You were right, Henry. It's not enough... But it's close.
You were right, Henry. It's not enough... But it's close.
You wanta wait for your share?
You wanta wait for your share?
Naw, I'd just blow it.
He's been taking the 8:10 Century Limited outa New York on Friday and getting in here early Saturday morning. He usually stays a day to check on his policy operations, and then flies back.
Wonder why he doesn't fly both ways.
Wonder why he doesn't fly both ways.
The porters say he runs a braced card game in one of the cars. $100 minimum, straight poker. Last time he pulled in here ten grand heavier than he left New York.

Fancies himself a gambler, huh?
We'll use the wire. Never known a gambler who wouldn't like to beat the ponies.
The wire is ten years outa date.
The wire is ten years outa date.
That's why he won't know it.
All you gotta do is show up with some money and look like a fool.
I also gotta win.
He's gonna hit ya with 20 grand, Eddie. How much cash we got?
Not enough to cover a bet that big.
Not enough to cover a bet that big.
Get a couple extra guys in the line, then. We'll give him the shut-out.
Looks like he's sulking.
If we're lucky, this'll bring him back stronger than ever.
What's the problem?
He wants to put a half million on Syphon.
Lonnegan's a fast egg, Henry. He's not gonna sit still for a standard play.
Everybody'll sit still for somethin'. What did ya find out about the train, Eddie?
I'm not sure I know it.
We'll give him the hook on the train, and play him here. You think I can get in that poker game, Eddie?
You in?
Yeh, I think so. I gave the kay- ducer a C-note. You find out the deck?
Yeh, I think so. I gave the kay- ducer a C-note. You find out the deck?
He usually plays with a Royal or a Cadenza. I got you one of each. He likes to cold deck low, 8's or 9's.

Nice work, J.J.
Look at that. He's got four apes with him.
That's what I like about these guys, J.J... They always got protection against things we'd never do to 'em.
How ya doin'?
Nothin' yet. I got a good one on the lead at Hialeah, but he's fadin'.
Yeh, that'd be real nice of ya, Mr. Lonneman.
Lonnegan.
Raise 500.
See ya and raise three.
See ya and raise three.

I guess I left it in my room.
What! Don't give me that crap you little weenie. How do I know you ain't gonna take a powder. You come to a game like this, you bring your money.
Never get enough, huh pal? I'd think you'd get tired of losin', Honnigan.
The name is Lonnegan.
The name is Lonnegan.
Make sure you see cash from this guy, Eddie. He's got the name for bettin' money he don't have.
I can't lay that off in time. We lose a bet that big, it could break us.
If ya win it could make ya, too.
If ya win it could make ya, too.
What are the odds on Syphon?
A half mill on an eight to one shot. You're dumber than I thought, Lonnegan.
You're more gutless than I thought.
She coulda killed me last night.
Too many people coulda seen ya go in her room. She was a professional. Used to work in the Dutch Schultz gang.

Hi there, Snyder. Things a little slow down at the Bunco Department tonight, eh? Somebody lose the dominoes?
You scored blood money today, Hooker. You need a friend.
You scored blood money today, Hooker. You need a friend.
Aw, find yourself a shoplifter to roll.
I'll tell ya what you did, smart boy. You tied into a loaded mark on 47th across from Maxies. You and Coleman played the switch for him and blew him off to a cab on 49th. If he hadn't been a numbers runner for Doyle Lonnegan, it woulda been perfect.
You're crazy. I'm not stupid enough to play for rackets money.
You're crazy. I'm not stupid enough to play for rackets money.
Not intentionally maybe, but that don't make no difference to Lonnegan. He'll swat you like any fly.

I'll square it with the fixer.

Nobody can buy you a prayer, if I put the finger on ya.
My end was only one.
Then you'll have to come up with another grand somewhere.
Excuse me, sir. Treasury Dept... I'd like to ask you a few questions.
What for? I haven't done anything.
What for? I haven't done anything.
We don't doubt that, but there's a counterfeiting operation passing bad money in the station. Have you made any purchases here today?
We don't doubt that, but there's a counterfeiting operation passing bad money in the station. Have you made any purchases here today?
Yes, a ticket to Chicago.
Then I'm afraid we'll have to impound your money until we're sure that it's all good. Can I see your wallet and your ticket, please?
But I got a train to make.

It'll only take 20 minutes or so. You can pick it up at the window down the hall.

But what about all these other people?
We'll get 'em! Give us a chance. I'm not the only agent in here, ya know. We go around advertising ourselves, how many counterfeiters do you think we'd catch, huh? You think I'm wearin' this rag here 'cause I like it? Christ, everybody thinks life's a holiday or somethin' when you got a badge. I been here since three this morning, Charlie, and I
I'm sorry, really I am, but my train leaves in ten minutes.
All right, I'll give ya a break. Down that hall there, there's an unmarked door on the left. Go on in there and wait at the window. I'll take this... ...in the back and run it through right away. We'll have you outta there in a couple minutes.

Yeh, sleepin'.
You got a back door to this place?
No. What's wrong with the front?

Look, I don't have time to fuck around. There's somebody out there I don't need to see. You got a fire escape or anything?

Just do what I tell ya and everything'll be jake.
What does this guy want?
He'd like to kill me.
Looks like he missed ya.
Yeh, this time anyway.
I, ah...thought you might wanna come out for a while. Maybe have a drink or somethin'.
You move right along, don't ya.

And you expect me to come over, just like that.
And you expect me to come over, just like that.
If I expected somethin', I wouldn't be still standin' out here in the hall.
I don't even know you.
You know me. I'm just like you... It's two in the morning and I don't know nobody.
You sure it'll be one of these two?
No. They're just the only ones we know of.
Twist? I told him the tale. He wants to see ya.
All right, when?
All right, when?
Tomorrow, after 4:00. Stay inside, I'll come in and get ya. And be hard on him for a while; he's talking money.
Tomorrow, after 4:00. Stay inside, I'll come in and get ya. And be hard on him for a while; he's talking money.
Okay, Tootsie.
Les, I got Mr. Lonnegan with me. He wants to see you a second.
What the hell's the matter with you. We coulda met at a club or somethin'.

I thought it might be good for him to see the setup.
I thought it might be good for him to see the setup.
Well we can't talk in here. They're having the place painted.
Hooker!
How ya doin', Jimmy.
Ain't seen you in months, boy. Thought maybe you took a fall.
Naw, just a little hard times, that's all. It's all over now.
Naw, just a little hard times, that's all. It's all over now.
You gonna have a go here? How 'bout a ten spot on the line here. The 4-9 been lookin' good today. Lotsa action on 28th Street down there, too. Pay ya 10-1.
You sure you wanna start off that big? Bet like that could put a real dent in us.
I feel lucky tonight.
I feel lucky tonight.
Aw, come on, Hooker, why don't you just...
Aw, come on, Hooker, why don't you just...
Three grand on the black, Jimmy.
Your boss is quite a card player, Carver. How does he do it?
He cheats.
He'll have to take a check. I couldn't find my wallet.
Yeh, he knows that.
Yeh, he knows that.
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
He hired a dame to take it from ya.
You were set up, Lonnegan. Shaw's been planning to beat your game for months. He was just waiting for you to cheat him so he could clip ya.
I could have you put under this train for this, errand boy.
I could have you put under this train for this, errand boy.
So could Shaw.
So could Shaw.
Then why the rat?
Then why the rat?
Cause I'm tired of bein' his nigger. I want you to help me break him.
What's the matter? You gotta get back to Shaw?
Naw, he picked up some jane in the bar. Can't see him till morning anyway.
Naw, he picked up some jane in the bar. Can't see him till morning anyway.
All right, then.
Why me? Shaw probably has lotsa enemies to choose from.
I need somebody respectable...but not completely legit. What I'm gonna do isn't very legal.
I need somebody respectable...but not completely legit. What I'm gonna do isn't very legal.
I'm a banker, friend. That's legit in this state.
I'm a banker, friend. That's legit in this state.
All you gotta do is place a bet for me at Shaw's place. I'll supply all the money and the information.
If you help me out, I'll pay ya back the money you owe Shaw, myself.
That's worth fifteen grand to ya?
That's worth fifteen grand to ya?
Maybe a couple million.
You're dreamin', kid.
660 Marshall Street. Tomorrow at 12:30, if you're interested.
660 Marshall Street. Tomorrow at 12:30, if you're interested.
If I'm not there by quarter of, I'm not coming.
You should always look to the back too, kid.
I was afraid you weren't gonna come. We haven't got much time.
I was afraid you weren't gonna come. We haven't got much time.
Get on with it then.
Get on with it then.
Sometime after 1:00 a guy's gonna call here and give you the name of a horse. All you do is take this two grand across the street to Shaw's place and bet it on that pony. There's nothin' to it, but don't take too much time. We only have 3 or 4 minutes after you get the call.

You're not gonna break him with a $2,000 bet.

This is just a test. The big one comes later. Be careful with that though, it's all I got.
This is just a test. The big one comes later. Be careful with that though, it's all I got.
And you were gonna pay me back?
And you were gonna pay me back?
I am after this race.
You really picked a winner, kid.
Give 'em a little time.
Well, what did I tell ya?
You're a lucky man, all right.
You're a lucky man, all right.
Lucky, hell. I could do it every day.
Lucky, hell. I could do it every day.
Why don't ya then.
Why don't ya then.
'Cause it's better to do it all at once. We're puttin' down 400 grand next week. At 5-1 we make 2 million. Twenty per cent of that is yours if ya stick with us.
'Cause it's better to do it all at once. We're puttin' down 400 grand next week. At 5-1 we make 2 million. Twenty per cent of that is yours if ya stick with us.
You got a system, Carver?
You stayin' in or not?
I'm in.
I'm in.
It's foolproof. We got a partner downtown runs the central office of the Western Union. Race results from all over the country come in there and go right across his desk on their way to the bookies. All he does in hold them up a couple minutes until he can call us and get a bet down on the winner. Then he releases the
You got the 400 grand yet?
Not yet, but... Hey, there's only a grand here.
Not yet, but... Hey, there's only a grand here.
I think we oughta place another bet tomorrow.

What is this? That's my money. You tryin' to muscle me?
What is this? That's my money. You tryin' to muscle me?
If your system's as foolproof as you say, you'll get even more.
I gotta talk to me partner first. We can't afford to expose our game too much.
Let me talk to him.
Let me talk to him.
No.
No.
You want your money back? Try and get it in a court of law. C'mon, don't be a sorehead. I'll make it worth your while. Migth even help ya finance the big play if this one works out.
What happened to your face?
Had a little fight with a raggle down on 13th. She got me with her ring.
A week's a long time, friend. Anything can happen. All of it bad.
He's right, Les.
What happened?
I didn't get the bet down in time.
I didn't get the bet down in time.
Oh, Jesus.
Tell your friend I'll have the money here by post-time tomorrow. We'll take the first race where the odds are 4-1 or better. And make sure I can get to that window this time.
How am I gonna do that?
How am I gonna do that?
I don't know, figure something out.
You want a drink or something?
No.
No.
We want to talk to ya about Henry Gondorff.
We want to talk to ya about Henry Gondorff.
Don't think I know him.

Well give yourself a couple seconds, crumb. You wouldn't wanna lie to me. Lt. Snyder here says you done a lotta griftin' in this town.
Well give yourself a couple seconds, crumb. You wouldn't wanna lie to me. Lt. Snyder here says you done a lotta griftin' in this town.
Lt. Snyder doesn't know shit.
You got nothin' on me.
We'll get it, and if we can't, we'll just make it up. Grand larceny, extortion. Counterfeiting, anything you want.
Look, I got nothin' against you, but you're in trouble here. All you gotta do is tell us when Gondorff's gonna play his chump. We come in at the sting, make the pinch, and you walk out free as a bird. No questions, no court appearance, nothing.
No.
You've already done time twice, and judges don't like three time losers. You wanna sit in the can for forty years, startin' tonight?
I'll make parole.
I'll make parole.
Like hell. You won't even get a review till you're seventy. And if the board starts to go soft, we'll let ya out in the yard some night with a hard-nose young bull who'll put fifty slugs in your face and ask what you were doin' there later.
Will you wait until the chump is played?
Hell yes. We don't care about the mark. He deserves what he gets.
Hell yes. We don't care about the mark. He deserves what he gets.
I mean completely played. Until he's beat and the score is taken. You come in before we beat him and I'll kill him. You'll have a tough time explaining that, won't ya.

All right, Hooker, but you take it on the lam, and we'll shoot you down on sight.
All right, Hooker, but you take it on the lam, and we'll shoot you down on sight.
Just as long as I get to finish the play.
Can't do it. There're telegraph inspectors all over the place. I got 750 grand coming in from the coast, and I'm not gonna blow it for a lousy 14 gees. We'll get somebody else to do our betting.
I could come up with 750 grand in a day if I had a reason to.
I could come up with 750 grand in a day if I had a reason to.
But who says you will. I got a guy I can depend on. He's liquidating everything he has for this. You wouldn't even give Carver his money back.

We were getting 50 from our guy.
With 20% coming off the top for me laying your bet. Either way you end up with 40.
Yeh, and what if we play tomorrow and he doesn't come up with the money. We risk our whole operation for nothing. I'll say when we make our bets.
Not if you want me to keep makin' 'em for ya.
Take it easy. Everything's all right. I put it on Syphon, on the nose.
On the nose! I said place. Place it on Syphon. That horse is going to run second.
All right, Riley. What the hell happened?
We missed him.
We missed him.
You weren't hired to miss him.
You weren't hired to miss him.
There wasn't any way he coulda known we was in there. We made a clean pick on the lock and didn't leave no footprints in the hall. Somebody musta wised him up.

This is the last time I expect to see you down here.
Never heard of the place.
What is this? I got work to do.
Sit down and shut up, will ya. Try not to live up to all my expectations. We were told you know a hustle artist named Johnny Hooker.
Do ya know him or don't ya?
Yeh, but I don't know where he is.
Yeh, but I don't know where he is.
Well we do. He's chummin' around with a Big C named Henry Gondorff. Ring any bells?
Well we do. He's chummin' around with a Big C named Henry Gondorff. Ring any bells?
Sure. Every bunco man in the country knows Gondorff.
Sure. Every bunco man in the country knows Gondorff.
There's word he's gonna run a con on the North Side here. We got a year-old Florida warrant on him, but it's a thin beef, and he can beat it in court unless we catch him cold. All we want you to do is pick up Hooker for us.

Why don't you pick him up yourself?
Why don't you pick him up yourself?
Cause the stoolies are used to street dicks jumpin' him. If word gets around that Feds are in on it too, Gondorff'll fold up the whole thing.

Wouldn't that be too bad. You'd hafta move outa this nice office ya got.
Wouldn't that be too bad. You'd hafta move outa this nice office ya got.
Don't crack wise to me, flatfoot. I spent a lotta time in dumps like this, eatin' Gondorff's dust while the bunco squad gets rich tippin' him off. But it's not gonna happen this time. We're not even gonna let the police know we're here. If you keep your mouth shut and do a job, there'll be a promotion in it for ya. And you

He's gonna set up Gondorff for us.

He'll never do it.

I think he will.
Sorry. I don't know anything about it.
Come on, gimme a break.
Come on, gimme a break.
I never tried to kid you reporters -- I'm telling you the truth.
Have the police got any idea where Wynant is?
No.
What about this Rosebreen?
Sorry. Don't know a thing.
What's your next step, Nick?
Right back to California. We've got to go home and rest up from our vacation.
Right back to California. We've got to go home and rest up from our vacation.
We'll see you before you go.
There's a physiological as well as a psychological angle in my father's relationship with Julia Wolf that the police have overlooked. And I think it explains everything. You see, my father was a sexogenarian.
He was?
He was?
Yes. He admitted it.
Yes. He admitted it.
Sexogerarian, eh? Yes. Yes. But I can't put that in the paper.
Sexogerarian, eh? Yes. Yes. But I can't put that in the paper.
Why not?

You know how they are... sex...

Is that what it means?

Of course.
I didn't know you invented that Smelting Process.
Look -- those are the first metals that came through.
All settled? Grand! Why did your mother ever divorce him? He's swell.
Wel-l-l, it seems he has a secretary.
Wel-l-l, it seems he has a secretary.
Oh. I'll do my own typing!
Cheer up, darling.
I'm sorry.
What's the matter, darling ... not sweet enough?
It's all right.
Darling, your father's all right. He'll turn up in time.
But tonight is Christmas Eve!
But tonight is Christmas Eve!
He's just forgotten. You know he forgets everything.
He's just forgotten. You know he forgets everything.
He's never forgotten a promise to me. I'm worried about him. I know something's happened to him.
What could happen to him, darling? You mustn't worry.... What is it?
Just a minute...
Now don't say that -- he's just off somewhere working.
I can't find him. I've tried everything. I thought you might know.
Any luck?
He's just around the corner.
She's got me worrying, too.
Don't start worrying about him. He's a good guy, but screwy.

Well!
That is, if it's all right with you.

Help yourself. Oh, Tom, show this gentleman...
Oh, Andy.
Don't cry.

I can't help it. You don't know.....

Darling, you can't go through any more of this. Now you get together your clothes and your skates and we'll go out to my family's in the country.

Dorothy!
How would you like to have a couple of little murderers for your children? It'd be fun, wouldn't it? Maybe they'd murder each other... keep it all in the family. That's what Father should have done. He should have killed me and Gilbert... then we wouldn't have had this to go through.

This is a pretty dead bunch, isn't it?
You're high enough.
You're high enough.
Why not?
Darling, don't cry. Please. I know it's terrible. But isn't it really better this way?
Oh, Andy, Andy!
How are you?.... Oh, I'm Mrs. Jorgensen now.... No, she isn't here. Is it about her father? Well, can I take the message?
Give it to me.
Give it to me.
Oh, here she is.
What is it? Has he found him?
Do you know where he's living? Oh.... Well, at least I'm glad he's all right. Thank you for calling. Goodbye.
What is it?
Nothing.
That isn't true. It was about your father. Where is he?
He's all right. Isn't that enough?
He's all right. Isn't that enough?
No.

You just want money -- and you haven't any right to any more. He made a big settlement on you.

That's gone long ago. I've got to see him. Where is he?
That's gone long ago. I've got to see him. Where is he?
I won't have you hounding him any more for money.
Mother .... you couldn't do that. You couldn't go to her.
I didn't say I would. But we've got to have money.
I didn't say I would. But we've got to have money.
Did it ever occur to you that Chris might work?

Shush!
Don't. It's horrible.
Nonsense! She got at she deserved.
You took that money from Julia's hand.
I didn't.

Then what are you hiding?

There!
Oh!

And I'll give then proof!
How are you? Here. Get under this.
Thanks... we're taking your cab.
Is your father still in there?
He's waiting for you.

Did he tell you where he was going?

He wouldn't say.

Tch-tch-tch -- Well, goodbye, Miss Wynant. You wouldn't drive slowly, so you don't get a tip.

You know, we know each other.
Of course we do! We've been friends for years.

That's what I was going to ask you. he's disappeared!

Why don't you try him again?

Thanks. We will. Goodbye.
I just wanted to relieve your mind. Your father's alive and all right.
Oh, thank heaven.
Come on in.
I've got to see you alone!
You heard about Julia Wolf?
Yes.
Yes.
There.
There.
What are you trying to tell me? That you did it?
What are you trying to tell me? That you did it?
Yes. I hated her for coming between my mother and father. She kept me from seeing my father. I went down there to ask her where he was. She wouldn't tell me, and I shot her.

That's the truth.
Hello, Dorothy.
Hello, Nick! And a party - celebrating father's third murder -
Dead?
He's been dead for three months.
It's been the same one for three months.
Forgive me. How are you?
Forgive me. How are you?
Take a good look at him, Dad. Now please try to remember him... 'cause he's going to be your son- in-law.
He'll still be your son-in-law!
You see how much we have to say.
You see how much we have to say.
Dad, this is what I really wanted to ask you....
Mother's set her heart on a big church wedding.
Yes, she would.
Yes, she would.
I hate all that fuss. But I'll do it on one condition -- that you're there to give me away.

Wouldn't it be a little embarrassing ... all of us there ... your other and me and your stepfather?

He can stay home. Please, Dad, won't you?
He can stay home. Please, Dad, won't you?
If you think it'll be all right.
Wait a minute. When is it going to be? I'm leaving town tonight.
Where are you going?
Where are you going?
It's a secret. I can't even tell you, my dear. I've got an important idea to work on.
It's a secret. I can't even tell you, my dear. I've got an important idea to work on.
A new invention?

We were planning to be married right after Christmas.

It's a promise?

That's one thing I won't forget. Where's Macaulay? I ought to be starting.
How's your brother?
He's all right.
I'd like to see him. Why don't you bring him down?
You know how it is, Dad. He's sort of under Mother's thumb.
You know how it is, Dad. He's sort of under Mother's thumb.
I know -- I know --
I know -- I know --
You're not missing much. He's cuckoo.
Like all the rest of us. Has this fellow... ...has he seen the whole family?
And he still wants to marry me!
And he still wants to marry me!
He's a brave man.
Poor Dad, does that still bother you?
Only in bad weather.
Only in bad weather.
But it isn't bad weather now.

Better get home before it is.

Goodbye, darling. Don't you dare forget... December 30th.
Goodbye, darling. Don't you dare forget... December 30th.
Goodbye, my boy. Take care of Dorothy. Show her that there is such a thing as a happy marriage.
You can take that out to the car.
Going to run him through the fluoroscope?

Yes.
Yes.
Do you mind if I come down and see it?
Do you mind if I come down and see it?
Not at all.
Not at all.
I'm very interested in that body.
Shrapnel!
Must have been in the war. That might account for the cane and his limp.
Must have been in the war. That might account for the cane and his limp.
Yes... yes.
What is it, Gilbert? Tell mother! What did he say?
He said that father's in town. He's been seeing Julia right along.
He said that father's in town. He's been seeing Julia right along.
That woman!
That woman!
She could tell you where father is.
Did they find any clues... a gun or fingerprints or anything?
Not a thing.
Not a thing.
Was there much blood?
Did you kill her?
Gilbert!
Gilbert!
Why not? You had a perfectly good motive.
Why not? You had a perfectly good motive.
I hope you won't talk that way to the police when they come here.
Well, I've got my alibi. I was at the Public Library. Where were you?
Children, will you go into the next room? I want to talk to Chris alone.
I saw him too... he was wearing a green suit with a white tie...
What are you talking about, Gilbert? You weren't there!
What are you talking about, Gilbert? You weren't there!
know. But I saw him -
How'd you people happen to pop in?
We hear this is getting to be sort of a meeting place for the Wynant family, so we figure we'll stick around in case the old man himself shows up. Then we seen him... ...sneak in and we decide to come up. And pretty lucky for you.

Yes. I might not have been shot.
Yes. I might not have been shot.
We were looking for this bird.
I never saw him before.
What's he want of you?
What's he want of you?
Wanted to tell me he didn't kill Julia Wolf.
Wanted to tell me he didn't kill Julia Wolf.
What's that to you?
What's that to you?
Nothing.
Nothing.
What'd he think it was to you?

Ask him. I don't know.
Ask him. I don't know.
I'm asking you.
I'm asking you.
Keep on asking.
Not without a warrant.
So you say - Go on, Bob.
Have you got a pistol permit?
No.
No.
Ever heard of the Sullivan Act?
This gun yours?
No.
No.
Who's is it?
Who's is it?
I'll have to try to remember.
I'll have to try to remember.
Okay. There's plenty of time. I guess we got to ask you a lot more questions than we counted on. We'll come up tomorrow when you're feeling better. Come on.
You oughtn't to play this trick on me. Running out when I was giving you time to rest up before I asked you those questions.
You mean about that gun?
You mean about that gun?
That ain't a gun any more. The firing pin's busted - the - Don't waste time talking about that.
Man to man, Mr. Charles, are you working on this case?
Man to man, I'm not.
So would I.
It's a bargain then. Anything you want to know?
What about the suicide?
Oh, that's a phoney. The men didn't even have to go down.
Oh, that's a phoney. The men didn't even have to go down.
I thought it might be. From now on, they're going to think that every thin man over six feet with white hair is Wynant.
You've been there?
Yeah. Couldn't find a thing. This is the way we figure it. Wynant goes to Julia's apartment. He finds Morelli there... sees she's two- timing him. They have a fight. But he figures he don't want to do anything then.... Morelli might squeal. So he goes away. He don't let his lawyer know anything has happened... he lets him go ahead and and hand
No proof?
Nothing yet to cinch it.
Nothing yet to cinch it.
Fifty will get you a hundred that he didn't do it.
Fifty will get you a hundred that he didn't do it.
What do you mean?

For one thing, he was too absent- minded to hold a grudge.

Who's your candidate?

I haven't got that far yet. But I don't think that everything points to Wynant. What about the alibis?
I haven't got that far yet. But I don't think that everything points to Wynant. What about the alibis?
They're all O.K. Mrs. Jorgensen, the boy, Dorothy, Macaulay... even Morelli... we had to let him go.
They're all O.K. Mrs. Jorgensen, the boy, Dorothy, Macaulay... even Morelli... we had to let him go.
What about Jorgensen?
What about Jorgensen?
I'll check on that. I'm afraid this is kinder dull for you.
What about this Nunheim?
Oh, he's all right. We know all about him. He does a little stooling for us every once in a while.
Oh, he's all right. We know all about him. He does a little stooling for us every once in a while.
Did you know he was hanging around Julia?
Did you know he was hanging around Julia?
No.
No.
He's holding out on you.

Let's go and see. Taxi!
Well, what'd you think?
I think we're on the right track.
I think we're on the right track.
Who're you calling?
Who're you calling?
I'm calling your office so you can send out a man to trail him. I want to see where he goes.
I'm calling your office so you can send out a man to trail him. I want to see where he goes.
Trail him! Trail who?
Trail him! Trail who?
Nunheim!
Get anything?
She's ready to talk. It won't do any harm, though - to find out where he is.
I guess that cinches it, eh, Mr. Charles? He killed them both - Julia Wolf and Nunheim.
Fifty will still get you a hundred.
Fifty will still get you a hundred.
This is enough for me.
Just rolled them up and threw them in.
Lucky thing for us they weren't in that lime.
Lucky thing for us they weren't in that lime.
Extraordinarily lucky.
"D.W.R." That case you worked on... the guy who threatened to kill Wynant... what what was his name?
Rosebreen.
Rosebreen.
Could this be him?
Could this be him?
I never saw him. I don't think anyone saw him.
I never saw him. I don't think anyone saw him.
He said Wynant tried to steal an invention.
He said Wynant tried to steal an invention.
Yes. But we figured it was just blackmail...
Yes. But we figured it was just blackmail...
Just the same, Wynant wouldn't mind having him out of the way, would he? How long should you say this body'd been here, Doc?
What're you doing here?
I'll take care of him.
Are you kidding?
No.
No.
Why didn't you tell me? .... Why didn't you hold him?
Why didn't you tell me? .... Why didn't you hold him?
Because I found out for certain that he didn't commit the murders.
You mean that body-----?
--was Wynant's.
Shut up.
You see, he'd been very clever. Everybody, even our astute friend Guild, thought that Wynant was alive and that he was the murderer. But our hero had just one weak link in his chain. The telegrams, wires and telephones were all very well - but no one had seen Wynant. So he picked on poor Mimi here to strengthen his case. Mimi is the
When was the last time you gave her money for Wynant?
Yesterday. I gave her a thousand dollars.
Yesterday. I gave her a thousand dollars.
Seen any signs of it, Bill?
I said he hadn't written me.
Oh, then you did hear from him?
Oh, then you did hear from him?
Well....
Well....
Well, what?
Well, what?
He telephoned me today.
He telephoned me today.
He did!
He did!
I wasn't in. My secretary took the message. He left word for me to meet him at the Plaza.
I wasn't in. My secretary took the message. He left word for me to meet him at the Plaza.
When was that?
When was that?
About three.
About three.
Did you go?
Did you go?
Yes. But he didn't show up.
I know he'll turn up as soon as he sees this in the papers. You can't think he had anything to do with it, Mr. Guild. He wasn't the kind of man that....
Do you know what they fought about that night he went away?
Do you know what they fought about that night he went away?
I didn't know they had a fight.
I didn't know they had a fight.
Well, thanks. We'll call you when we need you again.
There are a few things we want to check up on.
I see.
I see.
You say you were in the room with the body from the time you discovered it 'til we came?
You say you were in the room with the body from the time you discovered it 'til we came?
Why yes.
Why yes.
Did you see anything in Miss Wolfe's hand?
Did you see anything in Miss Wolfe's hand?
No.
No.
Are you sure you didn't leave the room... that one of the bellhops or maids might not have been in there alone?
Are you sure you didn't leave the room... that one of the bellhops or maids might not have been in there alone?
I don't think so. Of course I was terribly upset... I hardly knew what I was doing.
I don't think so. Of course I was terribly upset... I hardly knew what I was doing.
The Medical Examiner seems to think that the body was touched. He says it looks as if the girl's hand had been forced open after she was killed....
That's all right. Well, we'll be going.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
You did!
That's nothing. I saw him myself.
What kind of clothes was he wearing?
A brown suit, brown shoes and a white shirt and a grayish tie with red, or reddish brown figures on it.
A brown suit, brown shoes and a white shirt and a grayish tie with red, or reddish brown figures on it.
Tell 'em.
That's ridiculous.
Let him have his say out.
Good morning --
Good morning, Lieutenant - Sorry.
But he's interested!
I don't mind telling you I'd rather have you working with us than against us.
Do you think that Wynant did it?
Looks like he planned, something. He shut up his apartment and his shop.
I think we may as well sit down.
I guess all the suspects are here.
Mr. Guild means guests! Oh, there are two more to come.
They'll be here. Don't worry. My men are picking them up.
They'll be here. Don't worry. My men are picking them up.
You're a great help to a hostess. I wish I always had you for my dinner parties.
Have a shot?
What's the idea of telling me you just knew the Wolfe girl by sight?
What's the idea of telling me you just knew the Wolfe girl by sight?
That's all I did, Lieutenant. That's the God's truth. Maybe I said hello to her or how are you or something like that when I saw her, but that's all I knew her. That's the truth. All right. Put your mouth in and I'll pop a tooth out of it.
She drives me nuts. She's been ragging me all day.
Maybe if you quit running around after other women you wouldn't have so much trouble with this one.
Maybe if you quit running around after other women you wouldn't have so much trouble with this one.
That's a lie, Lieutenant... Anybody that says that is a liar.
That's a lie, Lieutenant... Anybody that says that is a liar.
Want to take a poke at him?
Want to take a poke at him?
I didn't mean you, Mister.
You'd done better to have told me that in the beginning. Where were you the afternoon she was knocked off?
You don't think I had anything to do with it?
You don't think I had anything to do with it?
Where were you?
Where were you?
Marian! Marian! Don't go! I'll behave! I'll do anything! Don't go, Marian!
Let me go! Let me bring her back. I can't get along without her. I'll bring her right back and I'll tell you anything you want to know. Let me go!
Sit down! We didn't come here to watch you and that broad dance around a May pole. Where were you the afternoon the girl was killed?
I can't remember offhand, Lieutenant. Maybe I was over at Charlie's shooting pool. Maybe I was here. She'd remember.
How'd you like to be thrown in the can on account of not remembering?
How'd you like to be thrown in the can on account of not remembering?
Just give me a minute.... I'll remember. I'm not stalling, Lieutenant. You know I always come clean with you. Gee, it'd serve me right if you had pinched me... that's the afternoon I was.... wait, I'll show you...!
Don't mind what she says, Chris.
How can I help but mind? I'm constantly humiliated... just because I haven't money.

I couldn't go near that woman.

What are you going to do?
Just what I said I'd do.

You wouldn't do that... you wouldn't!

Wouldn't I. Just watch me.
Wouldn't I. Just watch me.
Chris -- Chris -- !
and there she was lying dead. The police said she'd probably been killed about ten minutes before I got there.
I thought you said you weren't going there.
I thought you said you weren't going there.
Why, you said...

Never mind.
We're just having a little drink.
So I see.
Who's that man?
He's not anybody. Just a fellow I used to know.

Don't worry. You won't see him again. What happened? Did you change your mind about going?
Don't worry. You won't see him again. What happened? Did you change your mind about going?
No. I just came back for a second. I wanted to get those bonds.

What bonds?
What bonds?
The government bonds. The ones you took from the office safe.

Oh yes. Why, you told me to sell them a long time ago.

Now see here, Julia. You're counting a little too much on my being absent-minded. You've been taking a little here and there for some time, and I haven't said anything about it. But this is fifty thousand dollars!

supporting that gang of loafers! There's not one of them that cares a damn for you. A wife who threw you out the first time your foot slipped. They wouldn't raise a hand to help you. And I've given my whole life for you. If you kicked off tomorrow, where'd I be? Out in the gutter! Sure I took those bonds. Who has a

They'll be pretty rough with you....with your record.

I never had it.

Then someone was in with you. Who was it? -- Who was it? I'll answer that -- Hello ... hello ...
Is there a Mr. Macaulay in the house? Oh, it's you.
Yes?
Oh, hello. Come on in.
Good morning. I'm afraid this isn't a very "Merry Christmas" for you.

Oh, he's sitting up.

Good.
Asta - don't bother Mr. Macaulay.
That's all right.
I got word from Wynant this morning...
So did we. I mean, Sherlock here.
Oh, please, Nick.
Would it help any if I could persuade him to meet you?
Did you get my money?
I do wish you'd tell me where you're going.

Well, let me do that for you.

You might do that. Get me a ticket for... No, you don't!
Thanks, and goodbye.

Nothing, thank you. Nothing. I wanted to see you... What's Mimi up to, Charles?
Mimi? ... Oh, Dorothy's mother. Does she have to be up to something?
Mimi? ... Oh, Dorothy's mother. Does she have to be up to something?
She usually is. Trying one way or another to get money out of Wynant. I wanted to find out if you were er - er - --sleuthing for her.

He sends word through Julia Wolf when he wants money... I give it to her and she gives it to him.
My wife.
How do you do? What did you say?.... He is?.... Where is he? Very well. He's back in town.... Wynant. Thank heaven. He's waiting for me now. Forgive me, Mrs. Charles... but I've been so upset. It's no joke working for a man like that. I must be off. Goodbye.... Goodbye,

I hate to bother you when you're laid up.

That's all right.
What are the chances of getting you to do what he wants?
Slim.
It might.
He gave me a code message to insert in the Times, in case I wanted to get in touch with him.
He gave me a code message to insert in the Times, in case I wanted to get in touch with him.
It wouldn't hurt to put it in.
I've done that already. He should appear, you know. It doesn't look well... his staying away at a time like this.
Hello.... oh, just a minute. Police department?
Hello.... oh, just a minute. Police department?
Hello.... Where? In Allentown. Yes... When is the next train? Right - I'll get that. Wynant's tried to commit suicide. They want me to come down and identify him. I guess this changes the whole story, doesn't it? That looks like an admission of guilt. And I had such hopes. I thought if you got on the case, you'd be able to clear him.
But it must have been Wynant. I should have known if it weren't his voice.
Oh he as clever about that. He called when you were out. That same afternoon, Julia telephoned to him. She said that you were coming, Mimi, to ask about Wynant. He got terrified. He was afraid that Julia would break down and tell... so he went to Julia and killed her and left Wynant's watch chain in her hand.
I have no right to answer that.
What about it, Tanner. Isn't that the truth?
Oh, Nick... Nick!
Hello, Mimi.
Hello, Mimi.
want to talk to you about something very important.
Clyde Wynant's crazy... absolutely crazy to stay away at a time like this. No wonder the police think he has something to do with it.
What do you think?
What do you think?
Oh, I know he didn't, but I wish I could find him... I have something very important to tell him. Macaulay won't help at all. He thinks I just want money.
Oh, I know he didn't, but I wish I could find him... I have something very important to tell him. Macaulay won't help at all. He thinks I just want money.
Well, don't you?
Well, don't you?
You're always teasing.
Nick, you will help me find Clyde -- won't you?
Now, Mimi, there are a thousand detectives in New York. Hire one of them.

But he knows you. All you have to do is get in touch with him, and tell him that Mimi says everything is all right... but that I've got to see him.

I tell you again, I don't want any part of it. Now you take Dorothy home and...
I tell you again, I don't want any part of it. Now you take Dorothy home and...
Dorothy! Is she here?
Dorothy! Is she here?
Yes...
Where's Gilbert?
Gilbert! Is he here too? We might as well be living in the lobby.
Chris may be at the club -- or somewhere -- I don't see that it's important --
You should have told them he'd disappeared.
But he has nothing to do with it!
That's not for you to decide. Everybody's under suspicion - especially running off like this -- The police will want his description. Is this a picture of him?
I tell you -- he didn't do it.
They'll want more than your word for that.
They'll want more than your word for that.
All right, then -- I'll tell them who did do it!
This is all very pleasant but why are here?
I've got some very important news - I've seen Wynant.
You did... where?
Last night. He came to see me at my apartment.
Last night. He came to see me at my apartment.
Oh, did he? What did he say?
Oh, did he? What did he say?
He didn't say very much. Wanted to know how I was and how the children were.
Because I don't believe that Clyde's dead! Why, you said yourself you saw him last night.
So I did. I saw him lying buried in his shop.
Perfectly absurd.
And the murderer is right here in this room tonight... he's sitting at this table. You may serve the fish.
Nobody told me. I did see him!
What did he pay you, Mimi, to stick to that story?
What did he pay you, Mimi, to stick to that story?
It isn't a story - it's true. I did see Wynant. He's not dead.
It isn't a story - it's true. I did see Wynant. He's not dead.
You're lying, Mimi. But then, you'd do anything for money. You're getting a good price for saying you saw Wynant and you figure you won't get anything if he's dead.

I'm lot going to stay here to be insulted -
I'm lot going to stay here to be insulted -
Macaulay, you drew up Wynant's will. Mimi was cut off, wasn't she, if she re-married?
I gotta talk to you. I want you to tell me something and I want you to give it to me straight. Get me?
Do you mind putting that gun away? My wife doesn't care, but I'm in a delicate condition.
I've never heard about you.
I didn't knock Julia off.

All right - you didn't.

I haven't seen her in three months. We were all washed up.
I haven't seen her in three months. We were all washed up.
Why tell me?
Why tell me?
I wouldn't have any reason to hurt her. She was always on the up and up with me. But that dirty little Nunheim -- he got sore cause I clicked with her and he didn't, so he put the finger on me.

I'd tell you if I knew. But I'm not in this. Ask the police.
That'd be very smart. That'd be the smartest thing I ever did. Me that a police captain's been in a hospital three weeks on account we had an argument. The boys would like to have me come in and ask questions. They'd like it right down to the end of their blackjacks. Now I come to you on the level. Studsy says you're on

Morelli - You knew Julia. Was she gypping Wynant?
She don't say she is, but I figure she is -

Why do you say that?

Thank you. Now I'll tell you why I know Wynant didn't commit those murders - Three months ago - the night that he caught you in Julia's apartment, he found out that Julia was cheating him, and was splitting with some man. He went to find the man. That man was.... Tanner, don't you...?
What am I? The fall guy?
I hope you won't let this news spoil your dinner. Nice food, isn't it?
So it's you he was after!
Hello, baby.

How many drinks have you had?

Six Martinis.

Six Martinis. You're not going to have anything on me.
What hit me?
That last Martini.
I can't lie here. I've got to get up and trim that darned Christmas tree.
Take it easy.
Who's that?
Santa Claus.
Come on -- relax -- Give them a drink.
We need ice.
I'd better order some food. That sounds like an interesting case. Wouldn't you like to take it?
I haven't the time. I'm much too busy seeing that you don't lose any of the money I married you for.
I haven't the time. I'm much too busy seeing that you don't lose any of the money I married you for.
Room service, please -
Sounds like a good case. Girl mysteriously murdered. No one knows who did it. They haven't found any clues yet -- no gun -- no fingerprints --
I wonder if they've -- I don't want to hear anything about it.
Isn't that my drink?
What are you drinking?
What are you drinking?
Rye.
Where did you get that?
She brought it in. Trying to make me believe she did it.
She brought it in. Trying to make me believe she did it.
What are you going to do with it?

Nothing, 'til I find out if it's the gun Julia Wolf was killed with. Keep her in here, and don't let those reporters see her. They might believe her.
She didn't tell me a thing.
Too bad you didn't bring your whip.
Nick! Nick! Are you asleep?
Yes.
Yes.
Good. I want to talk to you.

That's jolly.

I'd like to see you work.

Tomorrow I'll buy you a whole lot of detective stories.
That poor girl is in a tough spot.
There's nothing I can do to help her.
She thinks you can. It wouldn't hurt you to find out if you could, would it?
Darling, my guess is that Wynant killed Julia and Dorothy knows it. And the police'll catch him without my help.

You'll have to keep them anyway. The man at the Aquarium said that he wouldn't take them back.
Nick! Nick! There's someone to she you,
That's great. I was afraid I'd have to go to sleep.
You idiot! Asta! Stop that! Get down! Now, stay there.
All right... shoot! I mean... what's on your mind?

I'll get some towels.
I'll be all right. Don't let's fuss till the doctor comes.
Want a drink?

Yeah.
I wish that doctor'd come. How do you feel?
He'll be here. Give him time to get his trousers on. Where's Asta? Asta! Asta!
You're a fine watch dog.

Who gave it to you?

You did.
You did.
You must admit I have good taste.
Finished with these?
Yes. I know all they know about the murder. And I'm a great hero. The Tribune said I was shot twice.
I read you were shot five times in the tabloids.
That's not true. He never came near my tabloids. That's one thing I always protect... my tabloids.
Hello... send him up.
Who's that?
Who's that?
Macaulay.
Aren't you hot in that?
I'm stifling, but it's so pretty. The Kirbys.

Yes.
Yes.
Did I give it to you?

Yes.
Nick, listen. From Clyde Wynant! "Will you take charge of investigation on Julia Wolf murder. Communicate with Herbert Macaulay".
Let's see. Where's it from?
Let's see. Where's it from?
Philadelphia. Then he didn't do it, did he, Nick?

Sit down!

You talk as if I were Asta.

All right, hard guy. Get up and bleed on the rugs.
What's the trouble, Asta? Your balloon busted? So's mine.
What's the matter with you?

The mystery's all gone. And I wanted you to find out who did it.

Come on, Watson, we're going places.
This may be a little rough - you'd better let us go alone.
Catch me letting you go alone!
I wish they'd stop that. It makes me fidgety. Do you think they'll find him, Nick? He must be in New York.... Where do you think you're going?
I'm going to take Asta for a walk.

He's just been for a walk.

What's that? What are you up to? Nickie - what is this?
Looks like a hold-up!

Why shouldn't be close it? He went away.

I don't care - I'm just used to you, that's all -- If you let anything happen to him, you'll never wag that tail again!
Back to California
My soul, woman. I give you three murders and you aren't satisfied.

Wynant's body?

Yup. Don't you want something to eat?

But they all said it was Rosebreen's.
But they all said it was Rosebreen's.
That's what they think... Guild and all of them. They take it for granted that it's just another of Wynant's victims. Guild's hot-footing it around now, looking for Wynant. That's all that troubles him.

What makes you so sure it's Wynant's body?

Several things. Hello, Fred. We're hungry again. Yeah, and lots of onions. Oh, and coffee.

Nick, you'll drive me crazy. What things?
Nick, you'll drive me crazy. What things?
Huh?
Huh?
What things made you so sure?
What things made you so sure?
Oh. Well, the clothes for instance. They were carefully preserved, and the body was just as carefully destroyed. The person who killed him counted on one thing... that all skeletons look alike.

Well, don't they?
Well, don't they?
Sure.
You don't get another swallow 'til you really open up.
I remembered that Wynant had some shrapnel in his shin. It often bothered him. So I looked for it and I found it. Gimme.
How long has he been dead?
Couple of months anyway.
Couple of months anyway.
Then he couldn't have committed those other murders.

Smart gal.

Wynant dead? Does Dorothy know?
Wynant dead? Does Dorothy know?
No. Nobody but you.
I'm going to tell her.
Hey... hey. Don't do that.
Hey... hey. Don't do that.
But the poor kid's going crazy. She'd rather know her father was dead than that...

Who do you think did it?

Mimi...
Mimi...
Mimi!
Mimi!
Mimi, Jorgensen, Morelli, Tanner.....
You give such charming parties, Mr. Charles.
Thank you, Mrs. Charles.
I can't wait any longer. Tell me, do you think one of them did it?
Yes.
Yes.
I wish you'd tell me who.
I wish you'd tell me who.
I wish you'd tell me.
Serve the nuts - I mean, serve the guests the nuts.
I'm afraid you're lying, Mimi. You see, I really did see Wynant last night.
You're going to drive me crazy!
Let's see... where was I? Oh, yes. He went to find the man. That man was desperate! He knew that he was caught dead to rights -- and with prison staring him in the face, he took the only way out. He killed Wynant. It's terrible to tell you this way but your father's dead, Dorothy.
If that knife is missing, I'll look for it in your back.
After our hero had killed Wynant, he got a brilliant idea. He realized that he and Julia could still collect money. Wynant was supposed to be on a trip - no one knew where - so our dinner guest wrote letters to Macaulay, signing Wynant's name, so that Macaulay would continue to send the money to Julia. He even telephoned Macaulay -- Do you
Is that true?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Why are you saying it?
Why are you saying it?
It's the only way it makes sense.
It's the only way it makes sense.
I hope you're well.
I hope you're well.
His plan was still working beautifully. Wynant was established as being in town. The watch chain was handed over.... ...with a slight delay...to the police. The only hitch was a man named Nunheim who had found out something. Our hero paid Nunheim once to keep his mouth shut, and when Nunheim threatened him again, he bumped him off.
Come on out, now. He won't hurt you. Back to your old tricks, eh, Tanner?
No, Mr. Charles.
No, Mr. Charles.
How did you get in here?
How did you get in here?
I had a key. I worked here... till they closed the shop.

Yes, sir. Julia Wolf got me a job as bookkeeper.

Well, that's a hot one. You a bookkeeper! When were you ever a bookkeeper?

That time you sent me up last ... I learned book-keeping at Sing Sing. I figured it might be an in for me somewhere's.

Honest, Mr, Charles. I never touched that safe. Them bonds that were missing... Julia took them.

Trying to put it off on her?

Mr. Charles - she did - that's why he got sore at her and killed her. Listen, Mr. Charles -- I did do a little chiseling. I come to bring it back and fix up the books. I didn't want him to find out and come after me -

You can save that and tell it to the police. They'll be here in a minute.
You can save that and tell it to the police. They'll be here in a minute.
Police!
I'm sorry. Tanner, don't you want some wine?
No... no.
That's what Mr. Wynant said to me. If she re-married, all the money was to go to the children.
You shouldn't let that keep you from telling truth, Mimi. Mrs. Jorgensen - Were you ever divorced from Chris Jorgensen?
Nick Charles here?
Yes. Nick!
Yes. Nick!
You his wife?
You his wife?
Yes.
Yes.
He's a good guy. He sent me up the river once. Hey, Nick!
Was he a good detective?
I wouldn't know. That time he caught me was a accident. I led with my right.
Well, congratulations.
I'm going to give her a wedding present. Thought I'd better do it now, before I forget it. I can drop them on my way to... That's funny.... Where are those bonds?

I'm sorry... but...
Two weeks work gone for nothing.
Two weeks work gone for nothing.
I just wanted to tell you...

I don't care what you wanted to tell me. You're through! Get your things and get out!
Where are you going?
Home!
Home!
Home?
Home?
I'm fired.
I'm fired.
Who fired you?

You did.
You speak English? DO YOU SPEAK ENGLISH!?
Y-yes.
Where were you going?
Baghdad.
Baghdad.
What's in the other direction?
What's in the other direction?
This road, it leads straight to Kuwait.

Turn the car around.

Please, I beg of you. The American army is there. I am Iraqi. They will kill me.
Please, I beg of you. The American army is there. I am Iraqi. They will kill me.
Nobody's going to hurt you.
Think we're going to do it? Think we're going to war?
Not up to us. Up to the Iraqis. All they have to do is get out of Kuwait.
...And it's very important when you sit down never to point the soles of your shoes at anyone. It's considered offensive.
You know so much about the Middle East, you know where we can get something to eat.
Like learning Arabic? You're gonna learn Arabic you might as well learn were we can get something to eat around here.
I didn't learn Arabic because we were getting shipped here. You don't learn it in a couple of weeks. I studied it in high school.
Well, based on my knowledge of the region, its culture and her people I would have to say it's a box.
Can you eat it? If you can't eat it I really don't care what it is.
Paper.
It's a fortune box.
What's it say?
Help, I'm being held prisoner in a puzzle box factory.
It's a map, I think that's what it is.
There you go, Jaeger. Just find the buried treasure, and you're a millionaire.
A casual one.
Damn, this is sweet. We are going to be home in no time.
Damn, this is sweet. We are going to be home in no time.
Better grab up some sand to take home to your family.
You're out of your minds, you know that? Both of you. You don't even know if there's anything out there. What the hell are you thinking?
I'm thinking about when this war is over. Why you figure I'm here? 'Cause I got tired of being president of GM? If a brother doesn't play ball, or deal drugs there aren't too many big money prospects around, and I'm not particularly interested in spending the rest of my life fighting the oil companies' wars. So I say if maybe there's something out
Yeah! Welcome to beautiful Iraq. Land of enchantment and riches.
Oh, God.
What?
I know you think this is crazy, but a couple of hours from now you're going to be one rich dude trying to buy up every other puzzle box out there.
I know you think this is crazy, but a couple of hours from now you're going to be one rich dude trying to buy up every other puzzle box out there.
I'd settle for being alive. Really. Alive would be fine.
Why, yes, Jaeger. I believe it is.
No, please, not again.
What are we going to do!?
We're going to keep driving.
They stopped.
Wha...
Wha...
Oh, Jesus, they've stopped.
They shouldn't have been here.
We shouldn't have been here, Epps. There is a war going on!
We shouldn't have been here, Epps. There is a war going on!
This is miles from the battle lines. They were probably deserters.

Deserters would have run, they wouldn't have engaged.
Deserters would have run, they wouldn't have engaged.
They shouldn't have been out this way, that's all I'm saying.
What are you doing.
Low on gas. Got to refill.
You two fighting's not going to get us anything.
Him getting us stranded out here doesn't do much good either.
Maybe we are crazy for doing this. But if we do it, we do it right. I just needed to explain that in a way I wouldn't have to do it again.
Not much chance of that. Jaeger's an idiot.
Not much chance of that. Jaeger's an idiot.
He's not so--
He's not so--
He's an idiot, and he's not nearly as hard as he thinks.
He's an idiot, and he's not nearly as hard as he thinks.
How tough you have to be to make the army? All you've got to do is shoot a gun, and stop a bullet.
What kind of mine?
I don't know, and I wasn't about to mess with it.
I don't know, and I wasn't about to mess with it.
Should have blown already. Delayed fuse, that's Vietnam stuff.
Should have blown already. Delayed fuse, that's Vietnam stuff.
Maybe that's all the Iraqis could afford, okay? Maybe they got it on discount. Maybe the fuse is messed up. Or maybe it's going to go off in two seconds, and we won't have to worry about getting Jaeger down off there, all we'll have to worry about is finding the pieces.
We've got rope?
For climbing.
For climbing.
Break it out.
What if it's a Valloro 69? Just going to bounce right up out of the ground, explode in the air, kill him and us.
You just go when I say go.
You just go when I say go.
Should have at least gotten the map off of him. Blows up with him then we did all this for nothing.
Ready?
Yeah.
All right. Let's get out of here.
The soldiers are going to kill those people!
There's nothing we can do.
We can fight. That's what we're here for: To fight the Iraqis. To help the Shi'ites, and the Khurds.
I don't want to see people killed any more than you. But we try to help out we die, and all we do is die.
We can't just go off and--
We can't just go off and--
There's nothing we can do. We shouldn't even be here in the first place.
All we've got to do is make it to the top.
And find the treasure, and get it, and get back to the Humvee, and get the hell out of Iraqi without getting our heads blown off, but that's about it.
And find the treasure, and get it, and get back to the Humvee, and get the hell out of Iraqi without getting our heads blown off, but that's about it.
We're not going to find anything standing here. Let's get to climbing.
Not much of a pass.
Probably was a couple of hundred years ago when whoever drew the map came through here. Worn down to nothing now.
Probably was a couple of hundred years ago when whoever drew the map came through here. Worn down to nothing now.
Picks up again just on the other side.
The US Army: Always an adventure.
Let me see the map.
Should be easy going from here. Stay on the pass straight to the dot.
What do you figure it to be?
What do you figure it to be?
Got to be some kind of landmark; something distinctive.
Otherwise whatever we're looking for could be anywhere.
Basically. But the map has been pretty precise so far. I don't think it'll be too hard to--
Where'd they go?
I don't know. There's a lot of space up here. They could be just about--
I don't know. There's a lot of space up here. They could be just about--
Weird they didn't chase us.
And they can't fly around out there forever.
So we wait.
Missile!
Move!
All right. Let's break out some utility shovels, lanterns, and a claymore in case we have to do any blasting. Me and Jaeger'll climb down, and see what we can see.
What am I supposed to do?
What am I supposed to do?
Got to have someone here in case we need help making it back up. Doesn't hurt to have a look out either.
Epps!
I heard!
I don't think the line will take the weight of a man and the coins. Wes!? We'll send the gold up, then me and Jaeger'll climb back.
Ready when you are.
You ready?
All right. I'll go up, then you send up the gold and--
It'll be too dark to make our way back now. Let's bed down for the night and head out at first light.
What about the gold?
What about the gold?
What about it?
What about it?
Maybe we should split it up now.
Maybe we should split it up now.
We started this together, and we're staying together, so there's no point in splitting things up now.
We started this together, and we're staying together, so there's no point in splitting things up now.
What if we get separated? Way I see it if something happens I want to be carrying my share.
You're the one with all the ideas.
You've had your say, Wes. Now leave it.
You've had your say, Wes. Now leave it.
Maybe you've got ideas of your own for the gold. Maybe you've already got things worked out.
Maybe you've got ideas of your own for the gold. Maybe you've already got things worked out.
Maybe I do.
Maybe I do.
Maybe I don't need your ideas. Maybe I can do better on my own.
You got no reason to do that!
I told you: When I straighten someone out they stay straightened. This is how it works: Nobody touches the gold. Except when we're on the move and someone's carrying it, nobody so much as opens the pack to get an eyeful of it. Agreed?
You got no reason to hit me. I'm getting tired of you and Jaeger pushing me around.
Then get up and do something about it.
Get off him.
He snuck in here thinking we were asleep, only I wasn't sleeping. Would have slit our throats if I hadn't stopped him.
He snuck in here thinking we were asleep, only I wasn't sleeping. Would have slit our throats if I hadn't stopped him.
Get off him!
What happened?
I told you. He tried to steal our gold. He tried to kill us.
Stop it!
I told you; don't push me around.
Says they were deserters, they were afraid to fight, don't believe in Saddam anyway. They flew the gunship up here to hide out. When they saw us they figured we were going to kill them, so they shot first.
Why'd he come in our camp.
Says he wanted food. Liar. He wanted the gold.
How's he going to want the gold? He couldn't even know we had it.
How's he going to want the gold? He couldn't even know we had it.
He...he could have been watching us.
I don't care what he says, he wanted our gold. Would have slit our throats if he had the chance.
Doesn't matter. Whatever he wanted he didn't get it. We've got no need staying around here. It's light enough. Let's pack up and head out.
We can't just leave him. He'll run back to his outfit, report our position...
You said he was a deserter.
You said he was a deserter.
That's what he says. He could be a spy, or something.
That's what he says. He could be a spy, or something.
You don't know that.
You don't know that.
You don't know he isn't.
You're out of your mind.
He's an enemy soldier.
He's an enemy soldier.
I'm not going to let you kill him.
I'm not going to let you kill him.
We're at war.
We are not at war! You and I and Jaeger are AWOL. We have no authority--
He tried to kill us. If not just now, then in the helicopter. That's all the authority I need.
I'm not going to leave him be just so he can stab us in the backs the minute we turn around. I have been through too much to lose it all now just because the two of you don't have the stomach to do what has to be done.
I've got no stomach for murder.
I've got no stomach for murder.
It's a combat action.
It's a combat action.
It's murder, and I won't be any part of it.
It's murder, and I won't be any part of it.
Then step aside.
Then step aside.
No.
No.
Get out of my way.
You've got an awful lot of orders in you. Always giving orders.
I out rank you, that's why.
I out rank you, that's why.
In the service you do, but we're not particularly in the service right now. Way I see it, what we're doing, that doesn't particularly give you the right to toss orders around.
We been down this road. I told you how it is. Unless you feel like there's something you want to do about it...
What if I do?
No navicom. A lot of good you are now, Epps.
Lot of good you were when I was sinking in the sand.
Lot of good you were when I was sinking in the sand.
Without that navicam looks to me like you forfeit the right to be in charge.
Without that navicam looks to me like you forfeit the right to be in charge.
And let me guess who is.
I'm the one's got the big stick.
Suppose I don't go for that?
Suppose I don't go for that?
Then I suppose it'd be insurrection, and I suppose I'd have to kill you. I suppose.
Then I suppose it'd be insurrection, and I suppose I'd have to kill you. I suppose.
What about Jaeger?
What about Jaeger?
Nothing about him, unless he's got a problem about me dealing with you.
In the flack jacket. Still like getting hit in the back with a baseball bat. Took the air right out of me, but I was just unconscious for awhile. 'Course, you didn't stick around to find that out. You left me for dead.
We thought--
Wes, we thought you were dead, and we thought we were next. Hanging around to get killed wouldn't have done anyone any good.
Sure, and I guess it was just convenient there was one less person to split the gold with.
Sure, and I guess it was just convenient there was one less person to split the gold with.
Wes--
Wes--
Look, I know you guys are telling the truth. It's just the Shi'ites don't know that. I guess you could tell them...but then you don't speak the language do you?
Thanks for taking care of this for me.
Tell me something, Wes. Are you crazy, greedy, or just stupid? Jaeger says you're crazy.
You disappoint me, Epps. Always figured you to be a man; a real bright guy. I had respect for you.
That why you tried to put a bullet in my head in the middle of the desert.
That why you tried to put a bullet in my head in the middle of the desert.
That's just what things came to. Sometimes you can't help that. It doesn't change me respecting you. And now you let me down. I expected more from you, you know? I really did. I expected you to--
They'll kill you. You won't make it ten feet before they cut you down.
You don't know John Epps very well, do you?
Just keep quiet.
I have to answer him.
I have to answer him.
So you can give us away?
So you can give us away?
If I don't answer, he'll know something's up.
Give it to me!
If I give it to you, will you let us go?
Looks like at the end of the day we finally find out who's better than who, don't we, Epps? Like I said; I expected more from you.
It's like I said; you don't really know lieutenant John Epps very well, do you?
At-at-at-at-at. At-at-at-at-at.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
What does it look like I'm doing? I'm killing Iraqis. At-at-at-at-at. At-at- at-at--
At-at-at-at-at.
Knock it off!
Knock it off!
Don't get pissed at me, just 'cause I want to be ready when this war starts.
Don't get pissed at me, just 'cause I want to be ready when this war starts.
Ready for what? What are you supposed to be doing?
Ready for what? What are you supposed to be doing?
I told you, I'm shooting Iraqis.
I told you, I'm shooting Iraqis.
No you're not.
You know what? I think you got Schwarzkopf. You did! You got the General right in the ass. Now that's good shooting.
Blow me.
Blow me.
Another month in this desert and I might just.
Don't worry about Jaeger. He uses his personality as a form of birth control.
Blow me. Have I said that to you guys recently? Blow me.
Oh, man, you're not going to fall for that.
There might be something in there.
There might be something in there.
Yeah, the deed to the Brooklyn bridge.
Yeah, the deed to the Brooklyn bridge.
There might be.
This is stupid. It's going on a month now. How long are they going to let the Air Force piss on those bastards? They can bomb them all they want, Saddam ain't going anywhere without a ground assault. What the hell is the army waiting for?
Why you in such a hurry to get to shooting?
Why you in such a hurry to get to shooting?
I've got to have something to tell people when I get home besides I protected a stretch of dirt that nobody wanted for nothing in the first place.
You all want to lay off? God. I hope the Iraqis shoot me; put me out of my misery.
OH MY GOD!
What!? What!?
I did it! I got the box open.
You think?
Yeah, that's exactly what I think. You and the five thousand other suckers who bought those boxes. Let's get out of here. We got sand to protect.
They finally start the ground war, and where are we? Same place we've been since we got here. Securing freedom for the dirt.
Everybody's got a job to do. Figure it this way: At least you get to go home alive.
Everybody's got a job to do. Figure it this way: At least you get to go home alive.
I'd like to go home alive with a couple of Iraqi scalps hanging from my belt.
Don't even. You're not going to show me that tired map.
Wait. Wait.
I think you've got some issues to deal with. Really, when we get out of here I'm pretty sure it's shrink time for you.
Just listen to me! I've been doing some reading. In the Sixteenth century this region was invaded by the Turks. It became part of the Ottoman empire. When the Turks rolled in they raped, they pillaged, the usual stuff. Anybody who had anything wanted to hide it from these bastards. They buried their treasures, drew maps, and hid the maps in puzzle boxes. I

Wellllll, if you read it it must be true. Was it in the Star, or the Enquirer?
Wellllll, if you read it it must be true. Was it in the Star, or the Enquirer?
Christ! Wes, tell him. You know this stuff.
And you know what that area is? It's Iraq. IRAQ! We're doing a little thing with them right now; Desert Storm. Maybe you've read about it.
What we're doing is kicking ass. For God's sake they got Iraqis surrendering to news crews. The war is over. We've just got to keep shooting people 'cause the army spent all this money, and we've got to put on a show for the taxpayers.
It's war. People get lost all the time in war, cut off--
We disappear for awhile. We disappear, we came back; nobody knows nothing.
We disappear for awhile. We disappear, we came back; nobody knows nothing.
But we all got to be in for this. We all go, or we do nothing.
It's going to be cool, Wes. It's all all right.
We go, we get rich, we go home. It's that easy.
Now this is war.
Roger that.
You're such a pussy, you know that? How'd you get in the army?
Cool it, Jaeger. Hey, Wes? Wes?
But that's the great thing about Gold. A little goes a long way.
You know what I'm doing with my part of the gold?
Third. What you're going to do with your third.
Yeah. I meant... You know what I'm going to do with it? I'm going to buy a Sixty- three 'Vette Stingray. All tricked out and cherry. I'm going to be so sweet.
Yeah. I meant... You know what I'm going to do with it? I'm going to buy a Sixty- three 'Vette Stingray. All tricked out and cherry. I'm going to be so sweet.
A car? You're going to buy a car?
You're getting gold, and you're going to blow it on wheels?
What are you going to do with your <u>third</u>?
What are you going to do with your <u>third</u>?
Invest it.
Invest it.
Oh, that's fun.
Oh, that's fun.
It's not about being fun. It's about being smart. You take that money, you take care of it, let it grow, and you don't ever have to do anything again. Ever. That's freedom. That's what I'm talking about.
It's not about being fun. It's about being smart. You take that money, you take care of it, let it grow, and you don't ever have to do anything again. Ever. That's freedom. That's what I'm talking about.
And I'm talking about enjoying myself.
And I'm talking about enjoying myself.
You know, you sound just like a boy who's never--
Take the binoculars.
Wh-what do you think--
Wh-what do you think--
TAKE THE GODDAMN BINOCULARS!
Shut up! Both of you shut the hell up!
We've got to do something. We've got to turn around.
We've got to do something. We've got to turn around.
We can see them, they can see us. We run, they chase.
They'll shoot us!
We run they'll shoot us anyway. If we keep driving they might think we friendlies; Iraqis. Or even if they know we're Americans they might get scared, think we're part of a detachment and keep on going.
We run they'll shoot us anyway. If we keep driving they might think we friendlies; Iraqis. Or even if they know we're Americans they might get scared, think we're part of a detachment and keep on going.
They're not going to--
They're not going to--
It's the only way. We drive!
Figure they don't want to mess with us anymore than we want to mess with them.
Look at you, not even breaking a sweat. You're cool, boy. You're cool.
Steady it out!
I steady it out, they blow us out of the sand!
She okay?
Yeah. Yeah, she's fine.
Yeah. Yeah, she's fine.
Let's go.
What?
I'm just thinking, you know, if the rest of the boys knew what we're doing. I mean if they knew what we were coming back with.
I'm just thinking, you know, if the rest of the boys knew what we're doing. I mean if they knew what we were coming back with.
You can't tell anybody about this.
You can't tell anybody about this.
I know. I know. But I'm saying, if they knew. We're going to be millionaires, man. Millionaires!
It'd make their heads explode.
Millionaires, man.
Look at it. LOOK AT IT! Shot to hell. It's been leaking gas since the fire fight. I told you to check for damage.
...I know.
...I know.
And you missed this? How are you going to miss something like this?
And you missed this? How are you going to miss something like this?
I didn't miss it. I figured if you knew one of the reserves got hit you'd want to turn back.
What do we do with the Humvee?
We leave it.
SAY IT!
I got that...sir.
Hey...hey! Slow up. You don't have to go so fast.
Faster we get there, faster we get back.
Faster we get there, faster we get back.
Yeah. I know. I'm with you.
I'm gonna...I'm just gonna stop for a little water.
Don't drink up all of yours, 'cause you aren't getting any of ours.
Don't drink up all of yours, 'cause you aren't getting any of ours.
I'm just going to have a little sip, that's all. Just a sip.
What!?
Mine.
What?
Mine. Land mine!
You didn't step on any mine.
I heard it click.
I heard it click.
If you stepped on a mine you'd be dead by now. Nobody uses delayed-fuse mines anymore.
If you stepped on a mine you'd be dead by now. Nobody uses delayed-fuse mines anymore.
I heard it.
Oh, God! Oh God!
Just be cool.
Just be cool.
It's a mine, isn't it?
It's a mine, isn't it?
Just relax.
Just relax.
How'm I gonna relax standing on a mine!?
How'm I gonna relax standing on a mine!?
We're going to get off, all right. We'll get you off of there. Just...be cool.
Where you going?
Me and Wes are just going to talk.
Me and Wes are just going to talk.
Why you got to move away to talk!?
Why you got to move away to talk!?
We're going to be right over here.
We're going to be right over here.
You're moving away because it's going to blow up, isn't it!? It's going to blow up!
You're moving away because it's going to blow up, isn't it!? It's going to blow up!
I said be cool, all right? Now be cool!
There's a way.
Epps...
I said nobody dies. Nobody dies.
Epps, my leg is falling asleep.
My leg is falling asleep.
It's not falling asleep. You've only been standing there for three minutes.
It's not falling asleep. You've only been standing there for three minutes.
I'm the one who can feel my leg, and it's falling asleep.
I'm the one who can feel my leg, and it's falling asleep.
It falls asleep and you die, so wake it the hell up.
How's this going to work?
Me and Wes each going take an end of the rope, run our asses of, and yank you off the mine.
Me and Wes each going take an end of the rope, run our asses of, and yank you off the mine.
That's going to do it, right? I'm going to be okay.
You're going to be fine.
You're not going to let me die, are you!? Don't let me die!
When we start running suck up your breath. You're going to get the wind knocked out of you.
Don't let me die, Epps. I don't want to die.
You're going to blow yourselves up.
Wes is right. If there were any more mines we would have found them. Hell, that one you stepped on was probably old anyway; left over from the war with Iran.
Wes is right. If there were any more mines we would have found them. Hell, that one you stepped on was probably old anyway; left over from the war with Iran.
You don't know that. It could be a trick.
You don't know that. It could be a trick.
If we step on a mine we'll know it was. Let me see the maps.
This. Whatever it is.
It's the treasure, that's what it is.
You're not losing trust, are you?
Just figure it's my map, I ought to hang on to it.
I didn't have to stop anything, 'cause nobody was going to do nothing. We're in this together, understand?
Yeah, I understand. Wes doesn't want to come along in the first place, but he gets a third of the find. That's a sweet deal.
I don't hear any--
Shut up and listen!
Don't!
It's a fire fight.
It's a fire fight.
Single shots doesn't mean a fire fight. That's not a battle going on.
Iraqis. A bunch of them.
What are they doing here?
Well, it's Iraq. I'm not sure, but I'm guessing that has something to do with them being here.
What are they doing in the middle of nowhere?
They're doing more than slapping.
The Shi'ites are on our side? I didn't know that.
Not enough. We're out numbered and out gunned. They'd cut us to shreds.
So good bye, Shi'ites. Thanks for playing. We have some lovely parting gifts for you as you go.
X marks the spot.
Something like that.
Something like that.
But the white dot in the middle; that's got to mean something.
But the white dot in the middle; that's got to mean something.
I hope it means something, otherwise...
Where is it? Where'd it go?
Stay low.
Stay low.
Where the hell is it!?
Where the hell is it!?
Just stay down.
What are we going to do? What the hell are we going to do?
We're not going to do anything.
We're not going to do anything.
They're going to kill us!
They're going to kill us!
They can't shoot us in here.
If they land--
If they land, we can take them. If they don't land, then we've got nothing to worry about.
Think there might be more Iraqis?
Right now I wouldn't be surprised if Eartha Kitt showed up singing Send In The Clowns.
A whole lot of nothing.
So where do we start?
What are you doing?
What does it look like I'm doing?
What does it look like I'm doing?
It looks like you're not doing anything.
It looks like you're not doing anything.
I'm not. And I'm not doing anything, because there's nothing down here.
I'm not. And I'm not doing anything, because there's nothing down here.
Get up and dig.
Get up and dig.
We've been digging. We've been digging for hours. If there was anything here to find we would have found it.
We've been digging. We've been digging for hours. If there was anything here to find we would have found it.
Get up off your ass and dig!
Must be a compartment.
I feel air. Probably opens up outside somewhere. That's where the light comes from. Couldn't see it with the lanternon.
Maybe we should blast it loose with the claymore.
It's giving.
It's just a mongoose.
Is it dead?
Is it dead?
Yeah, Bwana, you got it.
It's not like I figured. It's cold. And it's heavier than I imagined.
I wouldn't know. I never imagined this. Not in my whole life did I ever imagine this.
I wouldn't know. I never imagined this. Not in my whole life did I ever imagine this.
You don't have to imagine it. Not anymore. Now all you've got to think up is what it's going to buy you.
Wait.
What?
What?
We send the gold up what's to stop him from taking off and leaving us down here?
We send the gold up what's to stop him from taking off and leaving us down here?
He's not going to leave us.
He's not going to leave us.
What's to stop him if he wanted to? All he has to do is cut the line...
Why do I have to stay down here?
Jesus, Jaeger.
Jesus, Jaeger.
I don't see how that plan's any better.
I don't see how that plan's any better.
Someone's got to send the gold up. It can't get on the line by itself.
All right. You go up, I'll send up the gold, then follow.
Yeah. Yeah, that'll work.
What the hell took so long.
Just had to get the pack unhooked from the line. It didn't seem that long.
Just had to get the pack unhooked from the line. It didn't seem that long.
Not when you're up here with the gold, I guess not.
Wes might be right about that.
It stays as it is. We're halfway home now. Let's not blow it by people getting ideas.
We should head Northeast.
Northeast? That's away from the Hummer; further into Iraqi.
Northeast? That's away from the Hummer; further into Iraqi.
There's another pass on the photo. We can avoid that narrow one we had to cross on the way up, and it should get us back down.
There's another pass on the photo. We can avoid that narrow one we had to cross on the way up, and it should get us back down.
It should, or it will? Least going back the way we came we know what we're up against.
It should, or it will? Least going back the way we came we know what we're up against.
You think you can make that pass weighted down when you almost fell the first time you're wrong, and you're not going to take my share of the gold with you trying it. We're heading Northeast.
What are we going to do? How are we going to find our way back!?
We'll find our way.
We'll find our way.
How!?
How!?
We'll find our way! We'll...
We got to go back. We got to go back for Wes.
Forget Wes.
Forget Wes.
We can't just leave him.
We can't just leave him.
Wes is dead!
Wes is dead!
What if he's not?
What if he's not?
Then he will be when those Iraqis get to him. He was going to kill you. He was one blink away from it. He's dead, Epps, and I'm sure as hell not getting my head blow off over his carcass.
No.
We need something: A flare, a signal mirror.
No.
What do you mean no? They can fly us home.
What do you mean no? They can fly us home.
They'll ask questions; want to know why we were out here.
They'll ask questions; want to know why we were out here.
We'll lie.
We'll lie.
They'll search the pack.
First Wes, now you?
I'm not like Wes. Wes was crazy.
I'm not like Wes. Wes was crazy.
And you; you've got it all together.
And you; you've got it all together.
I don't want it this way. I wouldn't kill you just to kill you, but I can't let you lose the gold for me. Not when we're so close.
I don't want it this way. I wouldn't kill you just to kill you, but I can't let you lose the gold for me. Not when we're so close.
That helicopter passes, and the only thing we're close to is death.
I'm sorry about that, Epps.
Is it all right if I stand up?
I'm glad I didn't have to kill you. I'm glad it didn't come to that.
Yeah. Well, me too.
Yeah. Well, me too.
I never killed anybody before. I talk a good game, but I'm not like that.
I never killed anybody before. I talk a good game, but I'm not like that.
Sure.
Sure.
Really, I'm not. Remember how I was talking I wanted to blow away all those Iraqis? That's all it was was talk. I was scared out of my mind to go to war. I still haven't gotten over stepping on that land mine.
Really, I'm not. Remember how I was talking I wanted to blow away all those Iraqis? That's all it was was talk. I was scared out of my mind to go to war. I still haven't gotten over stepping on that land mine.
You still got a map on you?
You still got a map on you?
What? Yeah.
Epps?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I don't want to die.
I don't want to die.
Makes two of us.
Makes two of us.
I know what I did just now was crazy, but you got to understand how much I want that gold.
I know what I did just now was crazy, but you got to understand how much I want that gold.
It's all right. I don't like it, but it's over now.
It's all right. I don't like it, but it's over now.
I never had anything before, Epps. I never was anybody. Not the kind of somebody you can be with a pocket full of gold coins. When I was in high school I used to--
Sorry.
Damn.
What do you think our chances are?
If we can find the Hummer, or some friendlies by sundown we might be okay. We've got enough water for that. But we won't make another day otherwise.
Wonder how the war's going?
It's got to be going better than this..
We can't just sit here. We've got to start moving, so pick.
You sure you want me too?
I pick that way.
Okay. Then we go this way.
Getting cold.
It's a desert. That's what deserts do at night; they get cold.
It's a desert. That's what deserts do at night; they get cold.
Epps...Epps! I'm gonna stop for a second.
Epps...Epps! I'm gonna stop for a second.
No!
No!
Just let me rest for a second.
Just let me rest for a second.
We've got to keep moving while there's still light.
We've got to keep moving while there's still light.
You know what I'm going to do? I'm just going to take a second. I want to look at the gold.
You know what I'm going to do? I'm just going to take a second. I want to look at the gold.
Don't you touch it.
Don't you touch it.
I just want to look at it. Remind me of what I'm dying for.
I just want to look at it. Remind me of what I'm dying for.
The deal was no one touches it until we get out of here.
The deal was no one touches it until we get out of here.
Yeah, but we made that deal while Wes was still alive. He's gone. Time for a new deal.
What do you figure it is?
Place all alone like that? Must be a boarder check point.
Place all alone like that? Must be a boarder check point.
Which boarder? Saudi? Kuwait? Syria?
Which boarder? Saudi? Kuwait? Syria?
Couldn't be Syria. We couldn't have gone that far north. It's got to be Saudi. Come on.
We can head back for our lines, and they don't even have to know about the gold.
Epps. What if they're not Saudi.
Well?
Well, we should identify ourselves.
Well, we should identify ourselves.
Yeah, I guess we should.
Even if they are Iraqis probably all they'll do is take us prisoner for awhile. Got to figure we're still kicking their asses in the war. They don't want any trouble.
Hell, they'll probably just surrender to us. Probably.
That's if the war is even still going on. Way things were shaping up it's probably long over.
Probably.
What did you say?
I don't know. Something Wes had taught me. I think it means "Don't shoot. We're your friends."
I don't know. Something Wes had taught me. I think it means "Don't shoot. We're your friends."
They must be Saudis. It's a Saudi checkpoint. Oh sweet, Jesus. Come on. Come on!
Oh, God...
They must have thought we were Iraqi when you yelled to them. They couldn't tell in the dark.
They must have thought we were Iraqi when you yelled to them. They couldn't tell in the dark.
What are we going to do?
Slip out your M-16.
And then what?
And then what?
And then shoot them.
And then shoot them.
I...I never killed anyone before. I told you that.
I...I never killed anyone before. I told you that.
Well, you're going to start with a bang, 'cause you've got four of them to take down.
Can't you--
I don't have a weapon.
Don't go bitch on me now! You were going to kill me. Kill them!
I just said I would. I don't think I--
I just said I would. I don't think I--
Shoot them!
An Iraqi?
I don't know. He didn't have a uniform on. He...he had on white robes, like the guys who killed Wes.
What do we do?
We can't stay here. Even if that wasn't an Iraqi soldier it's only a matter of time before some show up. Get all the water you can carry, and we'll head out on foot.
To where?
Sun rises in the East. We go the opposite direction. May not find anything, but at least we'll know we're heading towards Saudi Arabia.
What do we do?
We keep going, that's what we do. We ignore them, maybe they ignore us.
What do you make of them?
Shi'ites, I think.
Shi'ites, I think.
Is that good, or bad?
Is that good, or bad?
I don't know. They killed Wes.
I don't know. They killed Wes.
Why haven't they killed us!?
Why haven't they killed us!?
I don't know!
I don't know!
...Maybe...maybe we can fight our way out.
...Maybe...maybe we can fight our way out.
With what? Against how many?
With what? Against how many?
We can't just sit here waiting to die.
We can't just sit here waiting to die.
You come up with a better plan, let me know.
You come up with a better plan, let me know.
Maybe...maybe if we traded them the gold. If we gave it to them they might let us live; they might not kill us.
...Wes...?
You were shot. We were standing right there, you were shot!
I didn't say that. I never said--
Me? I say you don't have enough brains to be stupid.
Can you ride a horse?
No, but I figure now's a real good time to start.
Which way do we go!?
We go this way.
Damn it. We lost the horses.
The...the gold...
The...the gold...
It wasn't the gold. It was the claymore mine. The gold's in my pack.
It wasn't the gold. It was the claymore mine. The gold's in my pack.
When did you make the switch?
When did you make the switch?
It's always been like that. When you left me down in the crevice to send the gold up I figured I'd better...take precautions. I rigged it to blow if anyone opened the pack. Just in case somebody thought they could do better on their own.

But...
But...
We had a deal. No one touches the gold until we're out of here. No one breaks the deal, no one had anything to worry about.

What if it hadn't been Wes? What if...I mean, accidently, what if I had...
What if it hadn't been Wes? What if...I mean, accidently, what if I had...
You shouldn't think about things like that. It'll just make you crazy.
Well?
A car's got to come along sooner or later. When it does, we jack it.
A car's got to come along sooner or later. When it does, we jack it.
How do we do that?
How do we do that?
You lie in the middle of the road, look like you're hurt. When the car stops I run over to the driver and put a gun to his head.
You lie in the middle of the road, look like you're hurt. When the car stops I run over to the driver and put a gun to his head.
Why do I have to lie in the road?
Why do I have to lie in the road?
Somebody has to.
Somebody has to.
Yeah, but why me? What if the car doesn't stop?
Yeah, but why me? What if the car doesn't stop?
Then I'm a rich man.
Epps.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I want you to know... I don't know. I just think you're a hell of a guy.
I want you to know... I don't know. I just think you're a hell of a guy.
Thanks.
Thanks.
This whole time, you've kept your head. You didn't go money simple like me and Wes. You've just been trying to figure how to get us out of here. And you've been fair too. I mean, even after I...you know...
This whole time, you've kept your head. You didn't go money simple like me and Wes. You've just been trying to figure how to get us out of here. And you've been fair too. I mean, even after I...you know...
Threatened to blow my brains out?
Threatened to blow my brains out?
Yeah. Even after that. You didn't take it out on me, except for maybe making me lie in the middle of the road now. But I'd say you've been very fair. I just think it's a hell of a man who can keep from going money simple.
Yeah. Even after that. You didn't take it out on me, except for maybe making me lie in the middle of the road now. But I'd say you've been very fair. I just think it's a hell of a man who can keep from going money simple.
Don't make so much out of it. Only reason I haven't figured a way to get all that money for myself is because I've been too busy figuring ways to stay alive. Believe me; if I had a minute to catch my breath I might have played things the way you and Wes had. I'm no better than anybody else. I've just been busier.
Epps?
What?
What?
I'm thinking about taking a trip.
I'm thinking about taking a trip.
Thought you were going to buy a car.
Thought you were going to buy a car.
Still am. There's more gold than I thought, and since there's only two of us now... Where should I go?
Still am. There's more gold than I thought, and since there's only two of us now... Where should I go?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I've never been anywhere. I wouldn't know where to go. Where would you go?
I've never been anywhere. I wouldn't know where to go. Where would you go?
How the hell should I know?
Australia.
What?
What?
I'd go to Australia. Lot of land, not many people. I think after this I'd like to quit people for awhile. And the girls go crazy for brothers down there.
I'd go to Australia. Lot of land, not many people. I think after this I'd like to quit people for awhile. And the girls go crazy for brothers down there.
Really?
Really?
That's what I hear. Don't matter. Girls go crazy everywhere for a man with gold.
Well, this is it. We get the car, find some Americans. We find Americans we'll be all right.
We'll make up some kind of lie. They won't find the gold.
Epps, I don't think he's slowing down.
He'll slow down.
He's not slowing.
He's going to slow down.
Woods.
Hey, Jaeger. What's up.
Hey, Jaeger. What's up.
I'm looking for a favor. I need a map of Iraqi.
I'm looking for a favor. I need a map of Iraqi.
A map? All I got is maps. I'm gonna have Delayed Map Syndrome when I finally get out of here. What kind of map you need? Topographical, geographical, thermal?
That shouldn't be too hard to read. Iraq is the pink thing.
I could use some recon photos too.
Planning on going to war all by your lonesome?
Just...want to be ready when we do.
Just...want to be ready when we do.
Ready for what? Sight-seeing?
Ready for what? Sight-seeing?
The photos.
Some good ones.
They're all good ones. Satellites we've got can snap a shot of the boil on Saddam's ass.
They're all good ones. Satellites we've got can snap a shot of the boil on Saddam's ass.
Saddam's got a boil on his ass?
Could you stop, please. You're giving me a headache.
A headache?
A headache?
Yeah, a headache. My head hurts. You're making me uncomfortable.
Yeah, a headache. My head hurts. You're making me uncomfortable.
I'm making you uncomfortable. Baking away in a desert in the middle of nowhere facing three-hundred-thousand screaming Iraqis with nerve gas scud missiles, that doesn't bother you. But me making a little noise is driving you out of your skull.
I'm making you uncomfortable. Baking away in a desert in the middle of nowhere facing three-hundred-thousand screaming Iraqis with nerve gas scud missiles, that doesn't bother you. But me making a little noise is driving you out of your skull.
Yes. Yes. That's exactly it. Yes.
Yes. Yes. That's exactly it. Yes.
Okay.
We ought to kick their asses anyway. Even if they do get out of Kuwait we ought to kick their asses.
I don't think we'll go to war. We shouldn't even be here. This isn't our fight, it's a regional conflict. It should be decided regionally.
I don't think we'll go to war. We shouldn't even be here. This isn't our fight, it's a regional conflict. It should be decided regionally.
People are suffering.
People are suffering.
People were suffering in Afganistan, and we didn't do anything.
When do you ever point the soles of your feet at people?
I'm saying don't do it accidently.
I'm saying don't do it accidently.
Oh yeah. Accidently.
Come on. You're going to get us in trouble.
It was an accident. You saw it was an accident.
It was an accident. You saw it was an accident.
I'm just trying to help you guys out. It doesn't hurt to know something about Saudi Arabia.
Spanish wasn't hard enough?
I thought it would be good to know.
What does that mean?
Don't shoot me, I'm friendly. You can use that when you surrender.
Don't shoot me, I'm friendly. You can use that when you surrender.
How do you say "Come here, baby. I'm horny." I can use that now.
How do you say "Come here, baby. I'm horny." I can use that now.
Don't even try it. You offend a woman out here you're in serious trouble.
What is this?
Now you need me.
Now you need me.
What is it? You know so much about Arabland tell me what it is.
He says it's a box.
Yeah, you're funny.
Yeah, you're funny.
It's a puzzle box. If you can figure out how to open it there's supposed to be a treasure inside.
It's a puzzle box. If you can figure out how to open it there's supposed to be a treasure inside.
For real? A treasure?
And you're the guy who's going to open it.
I could.
You get it yet?
Naw, nothing.
Naw, nothing.
You will. You'll get it.
You will. You'll get it.
I'll show Epps. He'll be sorry when I get this thing open.
I'll show Epps. He'll be sorry when I get this thing open.
You really think there's a treasure inside?
You really think there's a treasure inside?
I don't care if there's a lump of coal in here. I just want to be able to rub Epps' face in it when I crack this thing.
Jaeger?
What?
What?
You know the fifteenth is the deadline for the Iraqis to get out of Kuwait.
You know the fifteenth is the deadline for the Iraqis to get out of Kuwait.
Yeah. So?

That's in two days.

We're going to war, aren't we. If they're doing all that it must mean we're going to war.
We're going to war, aren't we. If they're doing all that it must mean we're going to war.
It doesn't mean anything.
It doesn't mean anything.
Why would they do all that if we weren't?
Jaeger?
What!?
What!?
You ever think about dying?
You ever think about dying?
Come on, man. I almost had this thing open.
Come on, man. I almost had this thing open.
You ever think about it? You ever worry?
You ever think about it? You ever worry?
The only thing I worry about is how much Iraqi ass I'm going to be able to kick before this whole thing is over. The only people who I've got anything to worry about are the poor, dumb camel jockeys who don't know enough to get out of the way when I come rolling at them; an M-16 in each hand, and a grenade
At-at-at-at-at.
This is so weird. It's happening, but it's not. It's like a TV show, and we're part of it.
This is so weird. It's happening, but it's not. It's like a TV show, and we're part of it.

The longer the air force hits the Iraqis, the safer it'II be for us when we have to engage.
You know what, Wes? If you get a note from your mommy they might excuse you from the war.
It's...it's...I don't know what it is.
It's a container. Break the seal.
That's it. It's over. Eighteen hours into the war and it's over.
Those soldiers have got loafers on. What kind of army gives their soldiers loafers?
We...we could go home with something else.
What?
What?
With...with millions. Millions of dollars.
You're not saying what I think you're saying. I can't believe you're even thinking it.
It's right here. This region; an-Nagaf. I got recon photos. There're no troops there, no fighting--

It's about a hundred miles from where we are now. How long do you think it would take us to--
It's not a hundred miles. It's a hundred miles through three different kinds of terrain: Pure desert, mountains, a river. If the map is even real.
It's not a hundred miles. It's a hundred miles through three different kinds of terrain: Pure desert, mountains, a river. If the map is even real.
It's real. I'm telling you, it's real.
It's real. I'm telling you, it's real.
So you just want to cross into hostile territory in the middle of a war on a wild goose chase? It's crazy. Tell him it's crazy, Epps.
Epps, you're smarter than this. Jaeger I understand, but you're smarter.
You know it's real. You know it's real, and you know it's there. You know it.
You know it's real. You know it's real, and you know it's there. You know it.
You're insane if you think you'll find anything, and sure insane if you think you can get us there and back alive.
God! I don't believe I'm doing this. I don't.
Yes!
We're going to get court martialed, you know that.
Hell, we'll just buy our way out.
Epps, is that a sand dune.
Oh, no.
Hey, Wes, what kind of treasure you figure these people buried?
If! If there's a treasure.
If! If there's a treasure.
Yeah. If. Whatever. What kind you figure it is?
Yeah. If. Whatever. What kind you figure it is?
I don't know. It would be small, easy to transport and hide. Gold or jewels. Probably gold.
I don't know. It would be small, easy to transport and hide. Gold or jewels. Probably gold.
Yeah! Gold! How much?
Yeah! Gold! How much?
How the hell should I know how much?
If there's gold. If!
You know what I'm doing with my half?
This is too much. You don't even have the money and you're wasting it.
A car is not just a car where I come from. I had this friend, had this wicked candy apple red Sixty-four and a half Mustang--
Iraqis.
Oh, God!
Oh, God!
Two vehicles. They're not supposed to be here.
Two vehicles. They're not supposed to be here.
Oh, Jesus!
Oh, Jesus!
They're not...I had the pictures. They're not supposed to be here!
Yeah! Yeah!
I think I'm going to throw up. I am. I'm going to toss.
I think I'm going to throw up. I am. I'm going to toss.
You see that? Right by us. They went right by. You had them Epps; you called it.
I thought we were dead.
Yeah, well, we're not.
Yeah, well, we're not.
We got to get out of here.
We have to go back.
We're not going anywhere. Not 'til we get what we came for.
We're not going anywhere. Not 'til we get what we came for.
We just about got killed. You know what happened? We just about got killed, and you want to go on?
So, you just let us drive on knowing we were losing fuel? Knowing we were going to run low in the middle of nowhere?
...I figured...I figured you'd turn back.
We're not stranded. We've got enough gas in the other reserve to get us back.
Then lets go back while we still can.
Then lets go back while we still can.
As soon as we hit the mountain we would have had to go on foot anyway. We're not that far. We can make it.
You two don't even know how crazy you are. You want to go on your sick, little treasure hunt then go ahead, but mark me absent.
You have to go with us, Wes.
You have to go with us, Wes.
Really? What is that, an order, <u>private</u>?
Really? What is that, an order, <u>private</u>?
You have to go with us. You can't walk back...
Epps...
Doesn't matter. We're not going to be able to get him off it anyway.
How long we going to keep this up.
Until we're out of the mine field is how long.
Until we're out of the mine field is how long.
Haven't found a mine for half a mile, or more.
Haven't found a mine for half a mile, or more.
That don't mean nothing. Iraqis could have just spread them out like that; make us think we're in the clear.
That don't mean nothing. Iraqis could have just spread them out like that; make us think we're in the clear.
You want to crawl, crawl.
If all we wanted was the map out of you we could have taken it while you were standing on that mine pissing on yourself.
Probably would've too if Epps wasn't around to stop you.
I'm getting tired of you riding me, Jaeger.
Anytime you want to do something about it just let--
Jesus! What the hell did he do that for? They're Iraqis. Why are Iraqis killing Iraqis?
Those people down there are Shi'ites. You've got Shi'ites in the south of Iraq and Khurds in the North. Neither of them've got much love for Saddam. Probably figured once the war started there might be an uprising, so he sent his soldiers out to slap them around some.
Is there anything you do know?
I know you're a pussy. I know that.
So?
We have to do something.
We're American soldiers. We don't abandon people.
Funny you should say that while we're out looking for gold.
Funny you should say that while we're out looking for gold.
You're the one wanted to kill Iraqis so bad.
You're the one wanted to kill Iraqis so bad.
I've got a new agenda now, it's get rich. The only way the Iraqis figure into that is not at all.
Think we can make it?
We make it, or we go back empty handed.
Maybe they're as scared of us as we are of them.
Just seems weird they didn't chase us.
What do you think?
Lines up with the map and the photos.
It's got a bottom.
Guess we know what the next stop is.
You down?
Yeah, we're down.
Yeah, we're down.
What do you see?
What the hell are you doing!?
I think we found something.
With what? He doesn't have a weapon.
He's a soldier. He doesn't need a weapon. He's got rocks. He's got bare hands.
Says he's one of the soldiers that was in the helicopter.
He lived through that?
Maybe we should give him some water.
All last night he could have been--
All last night he could have been--
I think he wants something to drink.
I think he wants something to drink.
I'm not wasting my water on him.
So we'll take him with us. At least 'til we get back to the Hummer.
He'd just slow us down, and drink our water. And if we ran into any more Iraqis you know he'd sell us out.
Maybe we ought to...you know, bury him. Say some words over him.
You want to say some words?
You're going to burn up in those.
The white reflects the sun; it keeps you cooler. That's why they wear them.
Think the Iraqi's killed them all?
Probably shot a few. Scattered the rest. Murderers.
When my Shi'ite friends saw that they had shot an American they were very apologetic. Turns out we've been kicking ass in this little war. They figure we've finally gotten Saddam off their backs. They brought me to their camp, cleaned me up, fed me... I'm their new best buddy. America number one, Joe. But there's something the Shi'ites can't figure out: They can't
We had to take shelter in the checkpoint. Jesus, Wes, I killed the Iraqis in there.

You actually got around to killing someone. I'm impressed. I guess you're only half a bitch.

What?...Oh, no, THX. That's not true. Not satisfied? THX, I need you so much.
I was so scared...I didn't know what would happen with you...once I started. I almost let you go on so many times. It will be worth it, together. When I was alone, I knew.
But it's so hopeless...you're so beautiful.

You're not cleared for this precinct. Let's cross over first.
You slipped on a T297 transfer just before lunch, didn't you?
What?
What?
On the cervix transfer, you almost lost the T297.
What do you think you're doing? You're going to get us arrested.
But...you...
I can't go on like this. I can't.... I don't just sit around and watch people. If I make a mistake, it's all over. You see it every day. Do you want to see me taken away in pieces?
I don't want to lose you.
What are you doing?
I don't know.
If you....if you go back on sedation, you won't feel the same way about me. You'll report me for drug evasion.
I've got a slip movement to install on my next shift. I'll never make it the way I am now.
I couldn't turn you in, not now. I....I know I wouldn't!

It's all right now, shhhh it's all right.
Don't let them separate us.
Are you all right?
AH UGH.
They know. They've been watching us. I can feel it.
They don't know.
They don't know.
They're watching us now.
They're watching us now.

No!...No!...
Then why are they holding us here? Why don't they destroy us right away? Economically, it's not sound at all. Very much unlike....
I've said many times before, and I guess I'll have to repeat it again for your...
You always manage to avoid the issue: What's wrong with our present condition? We're COMFORTABLE and we have plenty of food...I feel absolutely no threat because there is no threat. Why incite trouble? You should examine your emotions. It is senseless...
What are you talking about? When did you sleep last? Do you know what your trouble is? You're blind. You've been here so long you can't see what is happening. We must unite. We need unity. We need action. ) We have come to a time when we must....
But we need a creative dissent. Our voices are not joined in any harmonious chorus, but the differences are differences of emphasis, not of fundamentals. Now, the new alignment's greatest need is to communicate with all its elements, rather than march along in parallel line that never converge. Tomorrow as we focus the new movement more clearly, we will gain a new unity.
What?
Good Lord!
A shelldweller. They live in the outer shell of the city. Quite unique, there have been two here before. They smell.
There goes another of your disciples.
It seems I am destined to endure many frustrations....but at the same time I am secure in the knowledge that the thrust of my studies has been in the right direction, and that even if it remains incomplete, my search has not been in vain.
I thought you were through with it!
We cannot stay here and allow ourselves to be destroyed. You can work with us. An organized plan of escape must be devised first. Could you see anything? You want to leave. You're not like them. You must have left something, or someone.
What's going on....what are you doing?
We're leaving.
We're leaving.
What?
What?
We're leaving.
We're leaving.
Who? Who's leaving?
Who? Who's leaving?
THX and me.
THX and me.
But you can't. We must escape.
I can just barely see him. I think he's leaving.
Impossible!
He's coming back for the rest of us. He can't make it alone.
I wonder how far he went. He's gathered invaluable information out there.
Wait! I'll talk to him.
Ask him about the air. He looks out of breath.
That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.
It may seem ridiculous to the untrained mind, but if you were able to interpret the calculations you would see that an apparent paradox is actually a perfect and elegant system in concept and design.
We must escape. We have plans. We can leave. We must wait until...
Incredible!
I can't see him at all. He's been destroyed.
No, look! Three degrees from the central azimuth.
How far did you go? Was it cold?
You have nothing to fear. You're safe again.
Well?
Out of a random selection of 150 locations with 150 possible sightings, there were 146 absolute negatives and four conditionals, most of which occurred in the early familiarization stages of the experiment and can be largely discounted.

Not very encouraging.
Not very encouraging.
On the contrary! It absolutely proves what I have always felt. We are located in an apparently uniform space with no visible limits. We are just now beginning to push back the clouds of ignorance and perceive the truth. We must continue the search.
I've got it! Astounding!
What?
What?
No one could have imagined anything one-thousandth as fantastic as the sober facts uncovered by patient inquiry. This world is in a state of static-mobility: we are at the same time moving and standing still.

We had a long talk and she agreed that it would be a good idea for you to switch. She felt that you had not been accurately mated to her in the first place... You're upsetting yourself. Would you like something?

I'm all right THX rises and they begin to walk along the passageway. At the end of the hall is a small metal door, a sign read "Level 842CON G, Division of Plastic, Vendable manufacturing stations" the door is jammed and it is difficult to open. Finally the latch snaps and the door swings open.

Thanks.
Hey, that's the guy-
We just got a bomb threat upstairs.
How's the print coming?
One partial from the handle matches the suspect from last night. Name's Carl Taylor. Long record of arson, assault, the works. The other print - we got nothing from our data base or the FBI or CIA... still waiting for Interpol.

No thanks, Bev.
Dispatch, this is Reilly.
Go ahead.

Patch me through to the Bomb Squad.

Aren't you on suspension?
Aren't you on suspension?
Just do it.
Just do it.
Hang on.
Who the heck're you?
You the Bomb Squad?
Where did you get this?
Off a girl's wrist. A suspect...
High-grade det cord. This girl, either she's got strange taste in jewelry or she's into serious demolition.
What do you mean?
Sorry about that. That's an inch of the stuff, imagine what the whole thing'd do.
Thanks.
Alright, let's check it out.
We can start in the area where the robbery occurred.
What're you talking about?
When you need us, you love us, when you don't, we're shunned by the rest of the department.
When you need us, you love us, when you don't, we're shunned by the rest of the department.
We've got one hour. Are you coming or not?
What was-? Why...?
That cop who bought it... you didn't tell us he was your partner.
What?
This isn't bumper cars, it's brain surgery. You wanna work with us, you do it our way, understand?

Now wait just a fucking-
Now wait just a fucking-
Be cool around my men, they don't trust strangers. And try not to swear so much, it's unattractive.
By the way, I'm Glass. This is T.J., and Pooch.
Mike Reilly.
We don't use the b-word. Bad luck.
So you're the "Device Squad"... and you defuse "devices"?

Treat. We treat devices.

Anything else I should know?

Don't push it, slick.
I.R.A. device. Deadliest class of tickers in existence. Computerized, multiple sensors, booby traps, the works. First showed up in a series of I.R.A. bombings in London couple years ago. One of their boys tripped it on himself and they went back to a less complicated timers. The Girl, is she Irish?
She's not talking. But, she could be. So, obviously, you've seen one of these devices before?

Only once, at Redstone.

Where...?
Nice performance back there. Where'd you learn that, Mike Ditka Sensitivity Seminar?
Hey, look--
Hey, look--
No you look, mister! First, you don't go calling my men names. It's bad for morale. Second, us "punks" happen to know a heck of alot more about police work than any vice cop ever did.

Oh yeah? Prove it.

Drive.
The place has already be combed. Forensics pulled over a hundred sets of prints inside.
Then let's go see what they missed.
So what were they doing here?
I don't know. You tell me?
I don't know. You tell me?
An abandoned machine shop... nice place to build devices. Low rent, too. But, you and Rice ruined their perfect hideout.

Redstone's the army training center in Alabama where they send the cream of the crop to learn about tickers.

Cream of the crop, huh? You?
Top of my class at West Point, thank you very much. Then off to Redstone. First half of the course we learned how to build devices... second half, we'd take them apart. Everything from firecrackers to hydrogen bombs.

Sounds like terrorist heaven.

There were a few guys in my class with names like John Smith, Bill Jones. I'd see them up ahead in the hall, call their name, but they wouldn't turn around. C.I.A. Funny thing, they'd always disappear after the first half of the course.

Just how easy is it to build a... device?
Just how easy is it to build a... device?
With a little training, you could go into a house and just from stuff in the bathroom and kitchen make something that'd finish off that alleged car of yours. Heck, didn't you ever watch MacGyver?
Typical profile, usually losers, nobodies that're afraid to confront their victims. They like scaring people. That's why they call in their threats. Same mentality as obscene phone callers.
Except they'll blow you up if you don't play along.
Except they'll blow you up if you don't play along.
No, ninety-ninety percent of them are full of baloney. They're into the power trip, not the damage. What scares me is that this guy is so sophisticated he could blow up whatever he wants, then disappear. The worst of the bunch, they love the challenge of creating the wildest device ever... and they love the carnage.
This is where the van was parked.
Yep.
Yep.
Then, it's gotta be here somewhere ...

Look, it's a longshot...

Bingo!
Nitro-cellulose. What is that, some kind of explosive?
Industrial wood oil. Separately, any one of these things could lead in several directions, but together ...
How long are we going to stay?
`Til we get a better lead.
Not bad for Bomb squad, eh?
What not bad. You've got a series of bombs, devices, that may or may not be connected, set by one or many nutjobs, who may or may not be linked.

Right.

Well... it's more than we had ten minutes ago.
You guys seem pretty tight.
We've gotta be. In this business, you don't exactly make alot of outside commitments.

Why do you do it?
Why do you do it?
I don't know, it's strange... it's not the best career path, but when you get the bug, there's nothing you can do about it. See, when you beat one of these things...
So cut both.
One shuts it down, one turns arms it.
One shuts it down, one turns arms it.
Which one's which?

I don't know. There's an old saying, when in doubt, cut the yellow wire.

You don't have to talk about it.
Pittsburgh, two years ago. Partner died, no back-up, I was too gung-ho. As usual.

I know. I was working a drug ring, deep cover. Played the part too well. When they pulled me out, I wasn't a cop anymore. My fiance had dumped me.

Your partner?
Your partner?
I guess I didn't realize how much I needed him. He kept me straight. It's been tough every second since.
I terrible with mechanical things.
No you're not, you just don't understand them. Here, do what I tell you.
It's working.
Congratulations, you just built your first ticker.

What do we do?
Talk to me. Let's assess.
Right.
C'mon, talk to me! We can do it!
He has a timer going as back-up, in case we got a hold of the remote. Okay... first, run your fingers along the edges, feel for a sensor.
Good, now the other side.
Nothing.
Nothing.
Okay, let's go in.
Keep talking.
Close your eyes, feel your fingertips. Tell me everything you feel.
Wires... metal, cold... something soft...
Don't touch that.
More metal... sharp edge...
Stay to your left.
Something round, two wires ...
That's the blasting cap - good! Okay, now grab it by the base and pull it straight up. No, Wait...

Easy, guys.
What do you think?
Call upstairs, see what you can find out.
Call upstairs, see what you can find out.
Right.
Right.
T.J., run a trace on this, see if you can pin down where it came from. Whoever these people are, let's hope they're all talk.
Whadaya mean?
It's from an IRA.
It's from an IRA.
Oh shit...
Hey, matches are a very big thing in our line of work.
"Punks", huh?
"Punks", huh?
Bev, give `em a call, find out what bowling alleys they supply in this area.
You got it.
We work fast enough for you?
Political.
Exactly my thinking. Except, none of the targets can actually be linked to government, political or special interest concerns. They seem to be just unrelated industrial companies. Some insured, some not.
Any word?
Nothing. Maybe they gave up, split town.
No, we're terrorists, stay back or we'll blow.
We're a bit busy at the moment, I'll give you a statement in a few minutes if we're still alive.
Bev, you're the greatest...
Hey, I'm next.
Yeah, he's helping us work up a profile on this thing.
Hope you don't mind, Captain, might help us catch these guys that much sooner. Coming?
We've lost brothers too, we know what that's like.
Let's get something straight. We're doing you a favor. You're not exactly a guy we want around explosives.
C4, plastic explosive.
Helluva fuck factor.
Computer device?
Unlikely. Probably, cash register or something.
Glass, what is it?
I was wrong... this didn't come from any cash register.
Relax, Pooch, it's just a ticker, it's not personal.
Let's face it, we all knew it would happen sooner or later. The guy who can build a mousetrap that's better than we are ...
Lane oil...
A bowling alley.
What do ay say?
Meg's lasagna. Good eats, Reilly. C'mon.
Alright!
We've created a monster.
Jesus...
Reilly! He's loaded!
Cover. It was suppose to be abandoned buildings, y'know. No one was suppose to get hurt. The night you busted us...We were checking to make sure there weren't any vagrants around. Scare them away.
Who is he?
Who is he?
Alex Swan. My brother. The other two are called Taylor and Leveau.
Alex Swan. My brother. The other two are called Taylor and Leveau.
Taylor's dead.
There is a motel downtown, near the Machine Shop... the Suncrest. Room 138.
Thank you.
Thank you.
He's my brother...
Then why tell me?
People are dying.
You okay?
Alex-
Alex-
I know. I warned them.
What is that?
Security.
What's the matter?
Nothing... just tired.
Why are we stopping here?
We're moving' on. I have to pick up the supplies. Just two little boxes.
No... No more killing.
Stay here.
Stay here.
Alex, please.
Alex, please.
Stay in the truck.
Who are you calling, sis?
What? Nobody, I-
Alex, please-
Shut up! Who is this?
Drop it.
Take him!
I want to work this.
You're vice, not homicide. Besides, you don't have the experience and you're too personally involved.
You're vice, not homicide. Besides, you don't have the experience and you're too personally involved.
But sir--
Looks like the stuff my dad used to use to blow up tree stumps back in Scranton.
Maybe she knows your old man.
What the hell was that?
A ticking bomb...
You touch me again and--
And what, you'll shoot me? Hey, don't mistake me for one of your partners, I'd like to make retirement in one piece.
You were lucky today, vice boy. Captain said to leave it alone, but just remember, I'm watching you.
I'm sorry, detective, but you're just not my type.
Prints?
Nothing so far.
Nothing so far.
What about the ballistics report?
What about the ballistics report?
Lab's backed up, we're still waiting for it.
It's a bluff. The guy's full of crap.
We can't take the chance. Ring down to the Bomb Squad. I want them on alert.

Son-of-a-bitch... my nose... This fuck-up is interfering with-
Reilly, what're you doing here?
I'm filing charges against that mother-
Can it, Pluchinsky. And shove some cotton up your nose.
He is!
Look, it's important.
Nitro, dash of Semtrex, vegetable oil ...
What kind of bomb was it?
Unsolved bombings in the last year... Boston, New York, Philadelphia... but no real match
Insurance?
How're you guys doing?
Still waiting for a miracle. Go ahead.
Mike. No thanks, I'm fine.
Time for bed, kiddos. Say goodnight.
That guy's wife must be pretty pissed off to play a trick like that.
No shit. I better send Meg flowers just in case.
Vice... Jesus.
That'd be some explosive pussy he's got his hands on.
Pooch, can you move it?
I don't know...
Good boy, Schnoz. Daddy loves you.
Scorch marks... looks like they used silly putty.
Fuckin A, I think I got two partial prints here!
Awright! How bout you, Glass, how's that chip shaking?
That's one more time than any of the rest of us have seen it.
Shit. We're fucked.
Oh shit...
Fuck factor ten.
Know what the problem is, kid? You're too ugly to get propositioned.
Look who's talking, old man.

You will, one day at a time. I'll be old and grey when it happens...
So what'll you do? After they give you the gold watch.
Hell, I got a gold watch... it just don't work. Maybe they'll give me a new fishing pole, or something useful.

She wanted to cook me breakfast.
We're vice, I didn't see no pimps or hookers in that van. But if you're so gung-ho, we'd best call it in for some back-up.
Nah, let's just take a look-see.
You okay?
Yeah, just a nick ...
Mike...
Don't talk.
Don't talk.
Take your time... one day at a time, kid...
It don't work-
Ain't that a shit--
Reilly, Vice. I-
Quiet!
Make an appointment.
It's about this.
P.E.T.N ...
What?
Vice cop on a homicide?
Captain assigned me to assist you.
Device.
Huh?
A what?
IRA - instant retirement account.
Got it! Ace Match Company, Flint, Michigan.
You mean you just--? ... You keep a record of... matches?
T.J., what're you doing?
My first undercover assignment. I gotta look good, right?
So what're we looking for?
Someone who smokes French cigarettes.
Someone who smokes French cigarettes.
In this crowd? It's gonna be Marlboros, Camels, and maybe a few Kools.
Looks like Pooch's doing okay.
He's married, he don't even know what a lesbian is.
Nice to be here.
That feeling won't last long.
Captain...
Reilly, what the hell happened out there? Why didn't you call for back-up?
Reilly, what the hell happened out there? Why didn't you call for back-up?
Sir, I--
Take it down to the Bomb Squad, Artie-
I'll do it.
What?
It's detonation cord, for a bomb.
I'll do it.
Goddamit, Reilly--
Goddamit, Reilly--
Look, I saw these guys, I can i.d. them.

You know after a shooting I would normally take your badge and weapon, but Glass called in already and confirmed it was clean.
You know after a shooting I would normally take your badge and weapon, but Glass called in already and confirmed it was clean.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
But from now on, any leads on this case go to Pluchinsky. He's primary investigator and you are unofficially assigned to the Bomb Squad... you and your new friends are not to be playing detective any more. Got it?
Yes, sir.
She's refused to say a word to anyone. What made you think you could get her to talk?
She's refused to say a word to anyone. What made you think you could get her to talk?
I didn't. But I had to try.
Glass, sorry about Pooch, he was a good man. We don't have time to give you a break right now, we're going ahead and-
My God, you're going to use her, aren't you?
My God, you're going to use her, aren't you?
Glass, you're to stand by with your team.

Reilly, you're done for now. What the hell were you thinking directing the Bomb Squad Team into hot pursuit. They had no business-
I know.
I know.
You've been at the center of two suspect fatalities and two Police Officer fatalities. I'll need your badge and your weapon.
Reilly, what the hell are you-?
Fire me later. Close in and we got the bastard.
Fire me later. Close in and we got the bastard.
Pull back. You're only an observer.
Reilly, what's happening? Reilly! Reilly! Do not engage. We're five minutes-
We'll keep him pinned in, you guys hurry up!
What? I may lose it again? But I haven't found it yet! I'm sorry. Goodbye! Yes?

M'sieu Laval, Madame would like to talk to Mademoiselle Gautier for a moment.
Very well, Jacques.
Pardon me, m'sieu. Madame Colet would like to see you in the living room.
At once, Jacques. We'll continue later.
M'sieu Laval, M'sieu Filiba would like very much to see you.
In a moment.

Yes, M'sieu Laval?
Yes, M'sieu Laval?
Madame has changed her mind. She'll be down in a minute.
M'sieu Giron is downstairs.
Tell M'sieu Giron I can't see him now. Impossible! And, Jacques. Dismiss the car! Madame is not going.
Tell M'sieu Giron I can't see him now. Impossible! And, Jacques. Dismiss the car! Madame is not going.

still studying the vase. Mariette appears. He turns to her.
Where did you find it?
Is this what you mean, M'sieu Laval?
erect in sweater, arms folded.
No!
in doorway. He bows, returns into office; door shuts.
Eleven o'clock!
A man in love, completely shaken. He sits on bed, thinks, then takes telephone slowly, decisively.
With the compliments of Colet and Company!
He bows, goes. Door shuts behind him.
The representative of the police wants to know how much money you had, M'sieu Filiba.
I had exactly twenty thousand lire. I had just cashed a traveler's check and put it in my wallet.
Why did you let this man in, M'sieu Filiba?
Well, he knocked at the door. You see, I was expecting two--uh--two business associates.
And then what happened, M'sieu Filiba?
I said, "Come in." And there he was. A fine-looking man with a moustache and long sideburns. He said, "Good evening. I'm the doctor." I said, "Doctor?" He said, "Yes, the doctor. I came to see about your tonsils."
The representative of the police wants to know if there is anything wrong with your tonsils.
No!
No!
<u>Niente!</u>
<u>Niente!</u>
That's just what I tried to tell him. Well, one word led to another. He really was a very charming fellow. So we talked for about ten minutes.
What did you talk about?
About tonsils.
About tonsils.
<u>Tonsili!</u>
<u>Tonsili!</u>
So I said to myself, "All right, if he wants to look at them, let him look at them. No harm in that." And then he said, "Say ah." And then I said, "Ah." And that's all I remember ... And when I woke up, I still had my tonsils, but my pocketbook was gone.
Pardon me, m'sieu, but I have the feeling we have met somewhere before.
I'm sorry, but I don't seem to recall the occasion. No, I'm afraid ...
I'm sorry, but I don't seem to recall the occasion. No, I'm afraid ...
Well--then it must be my mistake. I beg your pardon.
Yes, M'sieu Filiba?
You see-- No, no! And <u>yet</u>-- <u>Did</u> I--did--now <u>where</u> could we have--
I wanted to say goodbye to you.
Goodbye, M'sieu Filiba.

Adolph J. Giron.
Adolph J. Giron.
And you expect me to believe that?
And you expect me to believe that?
Naturally not. But I expect the police to believe it.
Why not? He's a thief--he's a criminal.
I don't believe it!
I don't believe it!
Then why are you afraid to let me prove it?
It would be a terrible scandal, wouldn't it?
Giron...!
Giron...!
Yes, Giron! Chairman of the board of Colet and Company. Honorary president of the Orphans' Asylum. Adolph J. Giron--distinguished citizen! ... Well, shall I call the police? I see! You have to be in the social register to keep out of jail. But when a man starts at the bottom and works his way up--a self-made crook --then you say, "Call the police! Put

It could have been marvelous ...

Wonderful ... But tomorrow morning, if you should wake out of your dreams and hear a knock, and the door opens, and there, instead of a maid with a breakfast tray, stands a policeman with a warrant--then you'll be glad you're alone.

I wanted to ask her to ask you if you'd be good enough to go out to dinner with me tonight.

Well, the evening is still young. Let's go down to the living room and talk it over. It's only ten o'clock.
But my dear M'sieu Giron, I'm having a tea party. Must I be bothered with all these papers now?
I'm sorry, madame, but there are still certain matters which I think you should attend to yourself. And I, personally, would not care to refer them to--to--

To M'sieu Laval?
Madame Colet, I've enjoyed the confidence of your family for more than forty years. I was a school friend of your husband's ...
I know!

Madame, let me ask you: Who is M'sieu Laval, anyhow? Where does he come from? What is he?

Yes, madame. You see, I have to get up very early. My little brother goes to school-- You see, Mother is dead.
Yes, that's the trouble with mothers. First you get to like them and then they die.
Two lumps, madame?
Please! Thank you.
Please! Thank you.
May I?
Yes, madame?
You see-- Oh, not a word to M'sieu Laval!

Potatoes. He doesn't want me to eat them-- and naturally I don't want to upset him.

Now. Uh--mademoiselle--in the short time you have been M'sieu Laval's secretary, have you noticed any change in him?
Well--uh--yes and no.

To me he seems rather nervous.

Very well, madame. Thank you.
Yes, madame?
How much is your salary?
Well, in times like these most people are cutting salaries, but suppose we say, in your case, three hundred and fifty?
Oh, madame, you're just too sweet for words!
I think you'd better go.

Well, where is it?
Water 14 feet above the keel in ten minutes... in the forepeak... in all three holds... and in boiler room six.
That's right.
That's right.
Five compartments. She can stay afloat with the first four compartments breached. But not five. Not five. As she goes down by the head the water will spill over the tops of the bulkheads... at E Deck... from one to the next... back and back. There's no stopping it.

The pumps --
The pumps --
The pumps buy you time... but minutes only. From this moment, no matter what we do, Titanic will founder.
How much time?
An hour, two at most.
Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews. Truly.
Thank you, Rose.
Mr. Andrews, I did the sum in my head, and with the number of lifeboats times the capacity you mentioned... forgive me, but it seems that there are not enough for everyone aboard.
About half, actually. Rose, you miss nothing, do you? In fact, I put in these new type davits, which can take an extra row of boats here. But it was thought... by some... that the deck would look too cluttered. So I was over-ruled.
I saw the iceberg, Mr. Andrews. And I see it in your eyes. Please tell me the truth.
The ship will sink.
The ship will sink.
You're certain?
You're certain?
Yes. In an hour or so... all this... will be at the bottom of the Atlantic.
Please tell only who you must, I don't want to be responsible for a panic. And get to a boat quickly. Don't wait. You remember what I told you about the boats?
Yes, I understand. Thank you.
Mr. Andrews, thank God! Where would the Master at Arms take someone under arrest?!
What? You have to get to a boat right away!
What? You have to get to a boat right away!
No! I'll do this with or without your help, sir. But without will take longer.

Bottom, left, right. I have it.
Hurry, Rose.
Won't you even make a try for it, Mr. Andrews?
I'm sorry that I didn't build you a stronger ship, young Rose.
Good luck to you, Rose.
And to you, Mr. Andrews.
I'm in the sitting room. Heading for bedroom B-54.
Stay off the floor. Don't stir it up like you did yesterday.
Stay off the floor. Don't stir it up like you did yesterday.
I'm tryin' boss.
Who's the best? Say it.
You are, Lewis. You rolling?
Shit.
You know, boss, this happened to Geraldo and his career never recovered.

Get that outta my face.
She says she's Rose DeWitt Bukater, right? Rose DeWitt Bukater died on the Titanic. At the age of 17. If she'd've lived, she'd be over a hundred now.
A hundred and one next month.
A hundred and one next month.
Okay, so she's a very old goddamned liar. I traced her as far back as the 20's... she was working as an actress in L.A. An actress. Her name was Rose Dawson. Then she married a guy named Calvert, moved to Cedar Rapids, had two kids. Now Calvert's dead, and from what I've heard Cedar Rapids is dead.
We've put together the world's largest database on the Titanic. Okay, here...
Rose might not want to see this, Lewis.
So let me get this right. You were gonna kill yourself by jumping off the Titanic? That's great!
Lewis...
Holy shit.
Don't drop it Rose.
Don't drop it Rose.
Rush her.
Rush her.
It's hers, you schmuck. Look, Rose, I... I don't know what to say to a woman who tries to jump off the Titanic when it's not sinking, and jumps back onto it when it is... we're not dealing with logic here, I know that... but please... think about this a second.
Hey, Lizzy. I need to talk to you for a second.
Don't you mean work me?
Don't you mean work me?
Look, I'm running out of time. I need your help.
Look, I'm running out of time. I need your help.
I'm not going to help you browbeat my hundred and one year old grandmother. I came down here to tell you to back off.
I'm not going to help you browbeat my hundred and one year old grandmother. I came down here to tell you to back off.
Lizzy... you gotta understand something. I've bet it all to find the Heart of the Ocean. I've got all my dough tied up in this thing. My wife even divorced me over this hunt. I need what's locked inside your grandma's memory. You see this? Right here?
What?
That's the shape my hand's gonna be when I hold that thing. You understand? I'm not leaving here without it.
That's the shape my hand's gonna be when I hold that thing. You understand? I'm not leaving here without it.
Look, Brock, she's going to do this her way, in her own time. Don't forget, she contacted you. She's out here for her own reasons, God knows what they are.
The partners want to know how it's going?
How it's going? It's going like a first date in prison, whattaya think?!
There's a satellite call for you.
Bobby, we're launching. See these submersibles here, going in the water? Take a message.
Bobby, we're launching. See these submersibles here, going in the water? Take a message.
No, trust me, you want to take this call.
This is Brock Lovett. What can I do for you, Mrs...?
Rose Calvert.
Rose Calvert.
...Mrs. Calvert?
I told you you wanted to take this call.
Alright. You have my attention, Rose. Can you tell me who the woman in the picture is?
None of the stewards have seen her.
This is ridiculous, Lovejoy. Find her.
She's not on the starboard side either.
We're running out of time. And this strutting martinet... ...isn't letting any men in at all.
We're running out of time. And this strutting martinet... ...isn't letting any men in at all.
The one on the other side is letting men in.
The one on the other side is letting men in.
Then that's our play. But we're still going to need some insurance. Come on.
I make my own luck.
So do I.
We're too late.
There are still some boats forward. Stay with this one... Murdoch. He seems to be quite... practical.
What could possible be funny?
I put the diamond in my coat pocket. And I put my coat... on her.
Your daughter is much too hard to impress, Ruth. Mind your step.
So this is the ship they say is unsinkable.
So this is the ship they say is unsinkable.
It is unsinkable. God himself couldn't sink this ship.
Steerage swine. Apparently missed his annual bath.
Honestly, Cal, if you weren't forever booking everything at the last instant, we could have gone through the terminal instead of running along the dock like some squalid immigrant family.
Honestly, Cal, if you weren't forever booking everything at the last instant, we could have gone through the terminal instead of running along the dock like some squalid immigrant family.
All part of my charm, Ruth. At any rate, it was my darling fiancee's beauty rituals which made us late.
You know I don't like that, Rose.
She knows.
It's just the God damned English doing everything by the book.
There's no need for language, Mr. Hockley. Go back and turn the heater on in my room, so it won't be too cold when we get back.
You told me to change.
I couldn't let you wear black on sailing day, sweetpea. It's bad luck.
I couldn't let you wear black on sailing day, sweetpea. It's bad luck.
I felt like black.
Those mud puddles were certainly a waste of money.
You're wrong. They're fascinating. Like in a dream... there's truth without logic. What's his name again...? Picasso.
You're wrong. They're fascinating. Like in a dream... there's truth without logic. What's his name again...? Picasso.
He'll never amount to a thing, trust me. At least they were cheap.
What made you think you could put your hands on my fiancee?! Look at me, you filth! What did you think you were doing?!
Cal, stop! It was an accident.
Cal, stop! It was an accident.
An accident?!
An accident?!
It was... stupid really. I was leaning over and I slipped.
I was leaning way over, to see the... ah... propellers. And I slipped and I would have gone overboard... and Mr. Dawson here saved me and he almost went over himself.
You wanted to see the propellers?
Is that the going rate for saving the woman you love?
Rose is displeased. Mmm... what to do?
My God... Cal. Is it a --
Diamond. Yes it is. 56 carats.
It was once worn by Louis the Sixteenth. They call it Le Coeur de la Mer, the --
The Heart of the Ocean. Cal, it's... it's overwhelming.
I had hoped you would come to me last night.
I was tired.
I was tired.
Yes. Your exertions below decks were no doubt exausting.

I see you had that undertaker of a manservant follow me.

You will never behave like that again! Do you understand?
You will never behave like that again! Do you understand?
I'm not some foreman in your mills than you can command! I am your fiancee --
Something serious has happened.
That's right. Two things dear to me have disappeared this evening. Now that one is back... ...I have a pretty good idea where to find the other. Search him.
But I was with him the whole time.
Maybe he did it while you were putting your clothes back on.
Oh, Mother shut up! Don't you understand? The water is freezing and there aren't enough boats... not enough by half. Half the people on this ship are going to die.
Not the better half.
Where are you going? To him? Is that it? To be a whore to that gutter rat?
I'd rather be his whore than your wife.
Yes, I lived. How awkward for you.
Rose... your mother and I have been looking for you --
Is this in any way unclear?
What do I tell your mother?
What do I tell your mother?
Tell her that her daughter died with the Titanic.
You're precious to me, Rose.
Jewels are precious. Goodbye, Mr. Hockley.
I know. Perhaps you could join us for dinner tomorrow, to regale our group with your heroic tale?
Sure. Count me in.
Sure. Count me in.
Good. Settled then.
This should be amusing.
Can I bum a cigarette?
Just a soupcon of lemon... ...it improves the flavor with champagne.
No caviar for me, thanks. Never did like it much.
No thanks. I'm heading back.
Probably best. It'll be all business and politics, that sort of thing. Wouldn't interest you. Good of you to come.
There are boats on the other side that are allowing men in. Jack and I can get off safely. Both of us.
I'll be alright. Hurry up so we can get going... we got our own boat to catch.
I'll be alright. Hurry up so we can get going... we got our own boat to catch.
Get in... hurry up, it's almost full.
You're a good liar.
Almost as good as you.
Almost as good as you.
I always win, Jack. One way or another. Pity I didn't keep that drawing. It's going to be worth a lot more by morning.
Let's see... Fabrizio's got niente. Olaf, you've got squat. Sven, uh oh... two pair... mmm. Sorry Fabrizio.
What sorry? What you got? You lose my money?? Ma va fa'n culo testa di cazzo --
What sorry? What you got? You lose my money?? Ma va fa'n culo testa di cazzo --

'Cause you're goin' to America!! Full house boys!
Porca Madonna!! YEEAAAAA!!!
Goin' home... to the land o' the free and the home of the real hot- dogs! On the TITANIC!! We're ridin' in high style now! We're practically goddamned royalty, ragazzo mio!!
You see? Is my destinio!! Like I told you. I go to l'America!! To be a millionaire!! Capito?? I go to America!!
You know somebody?
Of course not. That's not the point. Goodbye! Goodbye!! I'll miss you!
How you two doin'?
I don't know what she's say, she don't know what I say, so we get along fine.
The boats are all going.
We gotta get up there or we're gonna be gargling saltwater. Where's Tommy?
You can smell ice, you know, when it's near.
Bollocks.
Bollocks.
Well I can.
Cor... look at that, would ya.
They're a bloody sight warmer than we are.
They're a bloody sight warmer than we are.
Well if that's what it takes for us two to get warm, I'd rather not, if it's all the same.
Oy, mate... that was a close shave.
Smell ice, can you? Bleedin' Christ!
Keep pulling... away from the ship. Pull.
Ain't you boys ever rowed before? Here, gimme those oars. I'll show ya how it's done.
The suction will pull us right down if we don't keep going.
We got room for lots more. I say we go back.
We got room for lots more. I say we go back.
No! It's our lives now, not theirs. And I'm in charge of this boat! Now row!!
They'll pull us right down I tell ya!
Aw knock it off, yer scarin' me. Come on girls, grab your oars. Let's go. Well come on!
I don't understand a one of you. What's the matter with you? It's your men back there! We got plenty a' room for more.
If you don't shut that hole in yer face, there'll be one less in this boat!
So you've not lit the last four boilers then?
No, but we're making excellent time.
No, but we're making excellent time.
Captain, the press knows the size of Titanic, let them marvel at her speed too. We must give them something new to print. And the maiden voyage of Titanic must make headlines!

Of course I leave it to your good offices to decide what's best, but what a glorious end to your last crossing if we get into New York Tuesday night and surprise them all. Retire with a bang, eh, E.J.?
Why have we stopped?
We've struck ice.
We've struck ice.
Well, do you think the ship is seriously damaged?
Well, do you think the ship is seriously damaged?
Excuse me.
Take my hand. I'll pull you back in.
No! Stay where you are. I mean it. I'll let go.
No! Stay where you are. I mean it. I'll let go.
No you won't.
No you won't.
What do you mean no I won't? Don't presume to tell me what I will and will not do. You don't know me.
What do you mean no I won't? Don't presume to tell me what I will and will not do. You don't know me.
You would have done it already. Now come on, take my hand.
You're distracting me. Go away.
I can't. I'm involved now. If you let go I have to jump in after you.
I can't. I'm involved now. If you let go I have to jump in after you.
Don't be absurd. You'll be killed.
The fall alone would kill you.
It would hurt. I'm not saying it wouldn't. To be honest I'm a lot more concerned about the water being so cold.
How cold?
Freezing. Maybe a couple degrees over.
Ever been to Wisconsin?
No.
No.
Well they have some of the coldest winters around, and I grew up there, near Chippewa Falls. Once when I was a kid me and my father were ice- fishing out on Lake Wissota... ice- fishing's where you chop a hole in the --

Sorry. Just... you look like kind of an indoor girl. Anyway, I went through some thin ice and I'm tellin' ya, water that cold... like that right down there... it hits you like a thousand knives all over your body.

You're crazy.
You're crazy.
That's what everybody says. But with all due respect, I'm not the one hanging off the back of a ship.
I'm Jack Dawson.
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Dawson.
HELP! HELP!!
I've got you. I won't let go.
Hello again.
Could I speak to you in private?

I don't... it wasn't just one thing. It was everything. It was them, it was their whole world. And I was trapped in it, like an insect in amber.

Well, I guess I will tonight.
What's this?
Just some sketches.
Just some sketches.
May I?
Jack, these are quite good! Really, they are.
Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.
Oh no! Oh, I'm so sorry. Truly!
Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.
And these were drawn from life?
Yup. That's one of the great things about Paris. Lots of girls willing take their clothes off.
You liked this woman. You used her several times.
She had beautiful hands.

And...?
You wouldn'ta jumped.
You know, my dream has always been to just chuck it all and become an artist... living in a garret, poor but free!
You wouldn't last two days. There's no hot water, and hardly ever any caviar.
You wouldn't last two days. There's no hot water, and hardly ever any caviar.
Listen, buster... I hate caviar! And I'm tired of people dismissing my dreams with a chuckle and a pat on the head.

I'm sorry. Really... I am.
I'm sorry. Really... I am.
Well, alright. There's something in me, Jack. I feel it. I don't know what it is, whether I should be an artist, or, I don't know... a dancer. Like Isadora Duncan.... a wild pagan spirit...
So then what, Mr. Wandering Jack?
Well, then logging got to be too much like work, so I went down to Los Angeles to the pier in Santa Monica. That's a swell place, they even have a rollercoaster. I sketched portraits there for ten cents a piece.

A whole ten cents?!
A whole ten cents?!
Yeah; it was great money... I could make a dollar a day, sometimes. But only in summer. When it got cold, I decided to go to Paris and see what the real artists were doing.

Why can't I be like you Jack? Just head out for the horizon whenever I feel like it. Say we'll go there, sometime... to that pier... even if we only ever just talk about it.

Alright, we're going. We'll drink cheap beer and go on the rollercoaster until we throw up and we'll ride horses on the beach... right in the surf... but you have to ride like a cowboy, none of that side-saddle stuff.

I think I would. And teach me to spit too. Like a man. Why should only men be able to spit. It's unfair.

They didn't teach you that in finishing school? Here, it's easy. Watch closely.
I saw that in a nickelodeon once, and I always wanted to do it.
Cal, surely you remember Mr. Dawson.
Jack, must you go?
Time for my coach to turn back into a pumpkin.
May I cut in, miss?
You're still my best girl, Cora.
I don't know the steps.
Just move with me. Don't think.
You're not one of them. There's been a mistake.
A mistake?
A mistake?
Uh huh. You got mailed to the wrong address.
Uh huh. You got mailed to the wrong address.
I did, didn't I? Look! A shooting star.

That was a long one. My father used to say that whenever you saw one, it was a soul going to heaven.
That was a long one. My father used to say that whenever you saw one, it was a soul going to heaven.
I like that. Aren't we supposed to wish on it?
Rose, you're no picnic... you're a spoiled little brat even, but under that you're a strong, pure heart, and you're the most amazingly astounding girl I've ever known and --
Jack, I --
Jack, I --
No wait. Let me try to get this out. You're amazing... and I know I have nothing to offer you, Rose. I know that. But I'm involved now. You jump, I jump, remember? I can't turn away without knowin' that you're goin' to be alright.
You're making this very hard. I'll be fine. Really.
I don't think so. They've got you in a glass jar like some butterfly, and you're goin' to die if you don't break out. Maybe not right away, 'cause you're strong. But sooner or later the fire in you is goin' to go out.

It's not up to you to save me, Jack.
It's not up to you to save me, Jack.
You're right. Only you can do that.
You're right. Only you can do that.
I have to get back, they'll miss me. Please, Jack, for both our sakes, leave me alone.
Fabrizio said you might be up --
Sssshh. Come here.
Will this light do? Don't artists need good light?
Zat is true, I am not used to working in such 'orreeble conditions. Hey... Monet!
Cal insist on lugging this thing everywhere.
Should I be expecting him anytime soon?
Should I be expecting him anytime soon?
Not as long as the cigars and brandy hold out.
What is it? A sapphire?
A diamond. A very rare diamond, called the Heart of the Ocean.
I believe you are blushing, Mr. Big Artiste. I can't imagine Monsieur Monet blushing.
He does landscapes.
Pretty tough for a valet, this fella.
He's an ex-Pinkerton. Cal's father hired him to keep Cal out of trouble... to make sure he always got back to the hotel with his wallet and watch, after some crawl through the less reputable parts of town...

Kinda like we're doin' right now -- uh oh!
Where to, Miss?
To the stars.
Are you nervous?
Au contraire, mon cher.
You're trembling.
It's okay. I'm alright.
When this ship docks, I'm getting off with you.
This is crazy.
This is crazy.
I know. It doesn't make any sense. That's why I trust it.
Looks okay. I don't see anything.
Could it have damaged the ship?
Could it have damaged the ship?
It didn't seem like much of a bump. I'm sure we're okay.
It's bad.
We have to tell Mother and Cal.

Now it's worse.
Now it's worse.
Come with me, Jack. I jump, you jump... Right?
Come with me, Jack. I jump, you jump... Right?
Right.
This is horseshit.
Cal, you can't be serious! We're in the middle of an emergency and you --
Don't you believe it, Rose. Don't!
He couldn't have.
That guy Lovejoy put it in my pocket.
I know, I know.
I know, I know.
See if you can find a key for these. Try those drawers. It's a little brass one.
So... how did you find out I didn't do it?
I didn't. I just realized I already knew.
You have to go for help.
I'll be right back.
I'll be right back.
I'll wait here.
Will this work?
We'll find out.
I'm not going without you.
Get in the boat, Rose.
You jump, I jump, right?
Right.
Look for something floating. Some debris... wood... anything.
It's so cold.
It's so cold.
I know. I know. Help me, here. Look around.
It's getting quiet.
Just a few more minutes. It'll take them a while to get the boats organized...
No... don't say your good-byes, Rose. Don't you give up. Don't do it.
I'm so cold.
I'm so cold.
You're going to get out of this... you're going to go on and you're going to make babies and watch them grow and you're going to die an old lady, warm in your bed. Not here. Not this night. Do you understand me?
You're going to get out of this... you're going to go on and you're going to make babies and watch them grow and you're going to die an old lady, warm in your bed. Not here. Not this night. Do you understand me?
I can't feel my body.
I can't feel my body.
Rose, listen to me. Listen. Winning that ticket was the best thing that ever happened to me.
You must do me this honor... promise me you will survive... that you will never give up... no matter what happens... no matter how hopeless... promise me now, and never let go of that promise.
I promise.
I promise.
Never let go.
Never let go.
I promise. I will never let go, Jack. I'll never let go.
I don't think I've ever seen such a flat calm, in 24 years at sea.
Yes, like a mill pond. Not a breath of wind.

If your grandma is who she says she is, she was wearing the diamond the day Titanic sank. And that makes you my new best friend. I will happily compensate you for anything you can tell us that will lead to its recovery.
Wait! Can you give us something go on, here. Like who had access to the safe. What about this Lovejoy guy? The valet. Did he have the combination?
That's enough.
Maybe she wants to make peace with the past.
What past? She has never once, not once, ever said a word about being on the Titanic until two days ago.

Then we're all meeting your grandmother for the first time.

You think she was really there?
You think she was really there?
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm a believer. She was there.
I'm sorry.
We were pissin' in the wind the whole time.
Is your stateroom alright?
Yes. Very nice. Have you met my granddaughter, Lizzy? She takes care of me.
There, that's nice. I have to have my pictures when I travel. And Freddy of course. Isn't that right, sweetie.
Would you like anything?
Would you like anything?
I should like to see my drawing.
Louis the Sixteenth wore a fabulous stone, called the Blue Diamond of the Crown, which disappeared in 1792, about the time Louis lost everything from the neck up. The theory goes that the crown diamond was chopped too... recut into a heart-like shape... and it became Le Coeur de la Mer. The Heart of the Ocean. Today it would be worth more than the
It was a dreadful, heavy thing. I only wore it this once.
I tracked it down through insurance records... and old claim that was settled under terms of absolute secrecy. Do you know who the claiment was, Rose?
Someone named Hockley, I should imagine.
Someone named Hockley, I should imagine.
Nathan Hockley, right. Pittsburgh steel tycoon. For a diamond necklace his son Caledon Hockley bought in France for his fiancee... you... a week before he sailed on Titanic. And the claim was filed right after the sinking. So the diamond had to've gone down with the ship. See the date?
It's been 84 years...
Just tell us what you can --
Just tell us what you can --
It's been 84 years... and I can still smell the fresh paint. The china had never been used. The sheets had never been slept in.
I can still feel its weight. If you could have felt it, not just seen it...
Well, that's the general idea, my dear.
Rose, tell us more about the diamond. What did Hockley do with it after that?
I'm afraid I'm feeling a little tired, Mr. Lovett.
Don't come any closer.
You had it the entire time?!
My God, Rose, what's gotten into --
Excuse me.
Mother, may I introduce Jack Dawson.
Charmed, I'm sure.
Rose, this is not a game! Our situation is precarious. You know the money's gone!
Of course I know it's gone. You remind me every day!
Of course I know it's gone. You remind me every day!
Your father left us nothing but a legacy of bad debts hidden by a good name. And that name is the only card we have to play.
I don't understand you. It is a fine match with Hockley, and it will insure our survival.
How can you put this on my shoulders?
Do you want to se me working as a seamstress? Is that what you want? Do you want to see our fine things sold at an auction, our memories scattered to the winds? My God, Rose, how can you be so selfish?
It's so unfair.
It's so unfair.
Of course it's unfair! We're women. Our choices are never easy.
Rose, get in the boat!
Goodbye, mother.
Anya!
Don't you hate people that surprise you? ... I do. We can't stand here.
Anya, I think you're crazy.
Any woman's crazy to feel about a man the way I do about you.
Any woman's crazy to feel about a man the way I do about you.
I wasn't running out on you. When I got over there-- made my plans--I'd have sent for you.
Then why the sudden exit without even telling me?
Do you want the truth, Anya?

It would be a nice change from you.

Here's to Europe! Couldn't try to look a little less glum, could you?
Don't be crazy--I'm tickled to death to see you.
Don't be crazy--I'm tickled to death to see you.
That's fine--because you're going to see a lot of me ... for the rest of your life.
But, Anya, dear! Unless you play we won't have a fourth.
I'm sorry, but you three men can play poker or something. Shall I see you tomorrow?
Hope we're not intruding.
This is Miss Marsh.
This is Miss Marsh.
Yes--I met Miss Marsh. In fact, she always seems to be turning up in the most unusual circumstances. What's the matter, Miss Marsh--aren't you feeling well?
Well--shall we go into dinner?
I'll join you later.
I'll join you later.
And <U>do</U> bring Miss Marsh-- --when she's had time to tidy up a bit.

I can explain--
I can explain--
Sure! You're never at a loss for words.
Don't look so uncomfortable, Lee--it interferes with your good looks. Give me a cigarette. What did you do--persuade her to come on this voyage with you?
Don't talk such bunk! She's one of the acts on the ship. I just ran into her by accident.

--and I can tell you where to get off.
And when you do I'll convey your respects by wireless to Herbert. Take it easy, Lee--no other woman'll ever get you. At least I'm honest when I tell you there must be something pretty low down in me--because I like you. You're such a swine!

I'm just commencing to enjoy this trip.
Feeling a little better, I see.
Yes, yes--the air-- --I'm getting plenty of air. Miss Marsh--Mrs. Rosson.
Thanks. I'll be there. About seven-thirty?
Sooner--if you like. See you again, I hope.
Good afternoon--
Glad to see you again.
I hope so.
That's a date.
Will you please excuse me? I'll be right back.
We'll save you a place at our table.

Isn't she lovely?
Yes--and <U>very</U> popular--
No--I'm furious!--Nobody seems to do anything about it--
Why worry? It was insured--how about that swimming lesson I promised you?
How do you do. Would you care to finish the game? I have a slight earache. --and it's so noisy up here.
Thanks, no. I despise any form of exercise. Don't forget we have an engagement for cocktails and cards.
You're Anya Rosson, aren't you? I've heard of you back in New York.
Sorry I can't return the compliment.

I don't understand.
I don't understand.
I think you do.
A rare pleasure to meet you, ma'am! Where I come from --out in Montana--we have some pretty women, but I guess if you walked down Main Street they'd turn out the fire brigade.
Montana?
Montana?
Lumber, ma'am--spent all my life out there piling up a bank balance-- --and now gosh darn it--"Honest Jack"--that's what they call me--is goin' to see the world.
--that's what we call double-a grade lumber, ma'am; You don't find a knot in a thousand feet.
Isn't that interesting?
You'll excuse me.
Well, it'll have to be poker--but I'm so unlucky in that game.
Will you pardon me?
<U>Gladly</U>.
You're lucky--out my way, in Montana, there's nothing else to do--
I'm going down to my cabin. I have to send a wireless-- see you later.
Did you find it?
No!--Did <U>you</U> take that bracelet?

We'll be expecting you.
We haven't any chips, Mr. Brett--Do you mind playing with cash?
Not at all.
Well, I'm off to a pretty good start.
If I ever won a pot that large the boat would sink.
I should pass, but I'll trail along--I'll take three.
I'll bet a couple of hundred.
Aces full.
And me coming in with two pair--
You're coming back--
That depends on how mother's feeling. You'll excuse me, gentlemen?
How about a little game later?
Fine--I'll be glad to.
Could I see you a minute?
Sure! Excuse me.
No gentleman would do that.
I agree with you--no gentleman, would--But I would-- --especially when my opponents have taken the precaution of marking the cards.
In that case--you owe us exactly sixteen hundred dollars.
Oh, no--I played with <U>your</U> cards--in <U>your</U> cabin--at <U>your</U> suggestion--If you've got a kick coming, make it to the Purser.

I'm making it to you. If I don't get it by tonight--you'll find it a <U>rough</U> voyage.
And I'll lay odds you got that bracelet.
I'll lay odds you get a pair of 'em--Why, a high-school kid could take you saps--and another thing--Lay off Sally Marsh. --"Honest Jack"! One look at your mug and the whole world buttons up its pockets.

You're a wise guy--Gimme back--

Looks like he's taking a trip--see the baggage? The only time they ever picked me up, McKinney walked through the room while they were grilling--let's see how good his memory is.

A thousand? She's one in a million--right off the top of the rosebush!
This is a business trip!
She was wearing a white dress with a cute, black hat-- and carrying a bag with S. M. on it. Funny--her name's not on the passenger list.

You take some awful chances.

Well, I had to get some dough to play with those suckers. Here, get this changed.

Well, if that's the case, you're sure of winning the first couple of hands--But what about after that?
That's where you come in. Now, listen, Shortie--
Have the purser give you twenty-five hundred dollars for this check--and bring the cash here.
Yes, Mr. Brett--right away.
Here's your twenty-five hundred, Mr. Brett.
Thank you. I owe you a dollar forty--here--keep the change.

You keep it--

See you later, Shortie--I'm off to the pool.
Hello, Jimmy. What's up?
Listen, Runt--Quick! Where's the ice?

On the drunk.

Get it!
Come in!
Hope I didn't keep you waiting.
I'll bet a couple of hundred-- I wonder what's keeping that boy.
Don't worry about that. We'll settle after the hand. Out in Montana where I come from a man's word is all that's necessary. What have you got?
Don't worry about that. We'll settle after the hand. Out in Montana where I come from a man's word is all that's necessary. What have you got?
Three Jacks.

That beats two Pairs. I'm glad <U>I</U> didn't win the first pot. Take the money, Mr. Brett.
It's your deal.
It's a pleasure.
How's your mother feeling?
Much better--thank you--
Well, to tell you the truth, gentlemen, I've sworn off playing poker.
Why, you wouldn't quit when you're ahead, would you?
Why, you wouldn't quit when you're ahead, would you?
Why isn't that a good time to quit?
I thought you were a sucker--
Think again--
That goes two ways.
Make it three, boys--I'll play this hand pat.
I think I've met you before, Mr. Brett.
Oh, yes. On the pier.

Before that. Your face is very familiar.

I wouldn't worry about it--it'll turn up-- How about a nightcap, Inspector?
No, thanks--I'll take a walk around the deck and then turn in--
No, thanks--I'll take a walk around the deck and then turn in--
Good night!
Thought you were going to turn in, Inspector.
Nervous. Couldn't sleep. Feel like a nightcap?
How about you?
No, thanks. I've promised to play cards.
No, thanks. I've promised to play cards.
You know what I'd do, if I were you--before the card game I'd go to the Purser's office.
You know what I'd do, if I were you--before the card game I'd go to the Purser's office.
Why?
Why?
Well, someone else besides myself may have seen you in the vicinity of Mrs. Rosson's cabin this evening--even the stewards in that corridor insisted on being searched. Get me?

Sure, I'll go.

I'll go with you.
Swell!
It's easy to see the Purser hasn't had much practice.
How about trying your fine Italian hand?
How about trying your fine Italian hand?
This has nothing to do with me-- But always remember, Purser, when you're searching anybody, take the lining of their coat, like this-- --run your fingers all along these seams.... Then-- back of the collar--<U>here</U>--that used to be a favorite trick--and never forget to put your finger down inside of the shoe--like this.

Hey!--you're tickling me.

Then we run our hands down a man's arms and legs-- like this--in case they got what you're looking for attached to a string. See what I mean, Purser?
Hello, young fellow!
Coming to the pool for a swim?
Coming to the pool for a swim?
Nooooo!--going to catch up on my reading. I'll take this one.
Wouldn't bet against her. Tell you what I will do--bet you I find that bracelet before we hit France. Not a hundred, though--just fifty.
It's a bet--come on, Sally!
Nice girl, that-- I'd hate to see <U>her</U> get a raw deal. You know, the great trouble with crooks is they're <U>too</U> smart. Now if I'd taken that bracelet, I'd find some way to slip it back--I'd know I could never get ashore with it.
Anybody that's taken the trouble to get it would be a mug to put it back.
Thought you might need me--don't talk, kid, and don't let him scare you--
Don't be too smart, Jimmy--you're out in the rough yourself. You had an argument with Lother a couple of hours before he was killed--but I'll deal with that later--
Don't get yourself all worked up--
You keep out of this-- You admit you thought of killing him--how were you going to do it?
Mmmmmmmmmhm.... Now, Jimmy, what were you doing in that corridor before the shots were fired?
Why, I--
Here's your fifty.
Thanks. That makes us square.
Their faces are familiar--but not to each other.
Now that that's settled, why not make the game a foursome?
No--I'll take Sally and give you the best of it.
Tell you what I'll do. I'll toss you for her--heads she plays with me.
Tell you what I'll do. I'll toss you for her--heads she plays with me.
O.K. Heads you win.
That's too bad.
I'm O.K. It didn't hurt much.
I'm O.K. It didn't hurt much.
I'm sorry to hear that.
That's all right. I'll attend to this.
Wait a minute--let's match for it.
Wait a minute--let's match for it.
Never mind--I'll pay for it now. It'll save time.
Oh, Denby--have you seen Sally around?
No--I'm looking for Miss Marsh myself. I thought you might know where she is--
No--I'm looking for Miss Marsh myself. I thought you might know where she is--
She was to meet me here--why don't you wait? She ought to be here any minute.
She was to meet me here--why don't you wait? She ought to be here any minute.
I would--but our rehearsal starts right away. Before I go I want to ask you a little favor. Sally is an important part of my show. Some day--not now--when you get a chance--let her come to just one rehearsal. I'll appreciate it.
I don't know what it is, but I won't use it. Is she entertaining you?
I should say not.
I should say not.
Good! At last you're making yourself useful. So long!
I won't--I'll ask for one right now. Sally tells me she's in love with you.
She did?
She did?
Yes--but don't ask me why--because I could never tell you. I don't know what most guys want out of life--but <U>that</U> would be enough for me--I wouldn't care about-- easy money--or--showing off my smart brains--I'd just like to live <U>my</U> life so nothing I did would bounce back and ruin <U>hers</U>--Do I make myself clear?
Yes--but don't ask me why--because I could never tell you.

Very clear. That's one favor I'll be glad to do you.
Very clear. That's one favor I'll be glad to do you.
O.K., kid-- I'm only sorry for one thing.
O.K., kid-- I'm only sorry for one thing.
What's that?
What's that?
If you hadn't agreed--I was going to throw you overboard--
Here you are, sir.
What'll I say?
Eighty cents a word--three--six--nine words. That'll be seven twenty, but it's too much--I'll show you how to save some money.
How?
Where do you live?
In New York.

That's right. I owe you a dollar sixty.
Wait a minute--I think I can cut something else out. "Back in four weeks." Instead of "in four weeks"--say "next month"--That saves another word.
Right. Here's eighty cents. Send it.
Just a minute--I don't think we need the word "Back" --Where <U>is</U> "Back"?
Back is in New York.
Back is in New York.
Your wife knows that, don't she?

Wait a minute--What <U>is</U> next month?

But who was the Devil?
So now we're in the mining Business. Turning into regular Tycoons. Gonna call this one the Mattie Blaylock. Mattie'll get a Kick out of that, it's her maiden Name.
And what a maiden, pure as the Driven snow, I'm sure.
So tell me, Wyatt. I'm curious. Do you actually consider youself A married man? Forsaking all Others?
Well yeah. Pretty much. I mean I Was no angel when we met but People change Doc. I mean sooner Or later you gotta grow up.

Wyatt, my God! You're shot to pieces!
No...
I'm a man without fear, Wyatt. I Literally don't care if I live or Die. But even I can't fight human Instinct. Somebody suddenly Starts shooting at me, I duck. But you... what on earth were You thinking about?
I don't know. It all happened so Fast. If I'd had a chance to Think about it I guess I probably Would've been scared but... Swear To God, Doc, I just don't know.
Doc...
Don't touch me, God damn it! Just Don't touch me! Come on...
What makes a man like Ringo, Doc? What makes him do the things he does?
A man like Ringo's got a great Empty hole right through the Middle of him and no matter what He does he can't ever fill it. He Can't kill enough or steal enough Or inflict enough pain to ever Fill it. And it drives him mad. Sick mad. Cold and dirty.

Just wanted to let you know You're sitting in my chair.

For a man that don't go heeled You run your mouth kinda reckless.
Don't need to go heeled to get The bulge on a dub like you.

Go ahead. Skin it. Skin that Smoke wagon and see what happens.
Listen Mister, I'm getting' tired-
Easy, gents. Private affair... Wyatt! Doc! Hey!
Jack...
Way ahead of you, Wyatt. You want Us to help you get Ike Clanton And Johnny Behan. Everybody knows They're the ones to blame for Your brothers.
They're nothing. They're nobody. I want the Cowboys. All of 'em. I Mean to break 'em up, drive 'em Out of the territory.
Got a sheaf of federal warrants. Being in the Territories it's up To our discretion how they're Served. That means we got the Cowboys without quarter. The Black flag, brother. No Prisoners, no mercy, amen.
500... Year's wages. And I never even saw a horse like that.
Talked it over. We decided we Don't need the money. Took out 13 Dollars each, though. Federal Posseman's fee. That all right?
Sure...
We should get moving.
Doc's just in no kinda shape.
Allie-girl...And Louisa! You're So lovely. I'm at your feet, Darlin'. Just at your feet. Guess it's only right. Ma always Said you were the prettiest.
But she doted on the frowner
Look at that. Busted. Brand new Money Ward, too. 33 years old And I don't even have a decent Watch. 'Bout time I started Lookin' out for myself.
Well here we are a family again. Been so long plain forgot how Good it feels. Want to thank you For that, Wyatt. All your doin'.
Well here we are a family again. Been so long plain forgot how Good it feels. Want to thank you For that, Wyatt. All your doin'.
We're gonna do it, boys. Gonna Get ours. Feel it in my bones. All we have to do is keep our Eyes on that brass ring.
Well that's your problem. Hey Virge, see anything of Doc while You were in Prescott?
Hit a streak when we left. Him And Kate.
Look pretty rough.
Just like any other hard cases. Gotta know how to handle 'em.
Well we're off and running. Just Acquired us a quarter-interest in The game at the Oriental.
Acquired?
Acquired?
So to speak.
Her maiden name was Sullivan.
Better go with 'em, honey. Here's Where I leave you.
Keep your eye on that brass ring. Don't let anything side-track you.
I know, I need a keeper.
You know, I was thinkin', maybe We ought to open our own place. That's the real money. Build it Up, milk it for all it's worth, Then sell it off for a bundle and Breeze out of this burg with more Money than Croesus and ready to Live like kings. Let's you and me Take a walk around town, Virge, See if we can
I can't hardly believe it. It's Working out just like you said, Wyatt. We're lootin' this burg Six ways through Sunday.
I can't hardly believe it. It's Working out just like you said, Wyatt. We're lootin' this burg Six ways through Sunday.
Pretty fun too, isn't it?
Pretty fun too, isn't it?
Kinda, actually, yeah. I gotta admit.
I couldn't help it, Wyatt. I Looked at that woman and it was Just like somebody slapping me in The face. I mean these people're Afraid to even walk down the Street and I'm trying to make Money off it like some kind of God damn vulture. That's not me, That's somebody I don't even know.
Virgil, please. Don't do this to me.
Virgil, please. Don't do this to me.
It's got nothin' to do with you, Wyatt. It's-
It's got nothin' to do with you, Wyatt. It's-
Nothing to do with me? I'm your Brother for Christ's sake. God, I Don't believe this. Talk to him, will you? Or hit him. Oh no, don't tell me...
Maybe I jumped the gun. Maybe Those Cowboys aren't near as bad As they're painted. You know I Was thinkin', there's a lot of Money in the cattle business...
Wait a minute, you thinkin' of Getting in bed with the Cowboys?
Wait a minute, you thinkin' of Getting in bed with the Cowboys?
Business is business. Don't have To love 'em to work with 'em. Not If there's money in it.
Business is business. Don't have To love 'em to work with 'em. Not If there's money in it.
You are the one, Wyatt. You sure are.
Billy Clanton, Wes Fuller, and Billy Claiborne. Now there's six Of 'em. This is like a bad dream.
Just stay calm, use your head. It'll be all right. Just the Same, though... Guess you better swear me in.
Here they are again. Look at 'em.
Easy, Virge, they're just tryin' To egg us on.
Wait till the liquor wears off. Once they start getting headaches They'll lose interest.
Wyatt, they're threatening our lives.
Wyatt, they're threatening our lives.
You'll never make that stick.
You'll never make that stick.
They're carrying guns in town.
They're carrying guns in town.
Virge, that's a misdemeanor. You Go down there to arrest 'em, Something goes wrong, maybe this Time somebody gets his head Broke, suddenly it's a mess and It won't end there, you'll have Cowboys comin' around lookin' for Trouble from here to Christmas. You gonna risk all that over a Misdemeanor?

No, damn it, it's wrong, they're Breakin' the law.
All right, Virge, your call. But Give Doc the shotgun. They'll be Less apt to get nervy if they see Him on the street howitzer.
Virge, you're makin' the arrest. You make contact, I'll back you Up. Morgan'll back me up, Doc'll Keep an eye out for trouble. And Keep your hands on your guns. They even look like they're gonna Start something, buffalo 'em. Right over the head.

Look at 'em all. They love it. How in the hell'd we get Ourselves into this?
Getting late. Guess I'll turn in.
Bundle up, Virge. Cold out there.
Virgil?
Wyatt...
What about all these saloons?
Ah, now that's the real mother- Lode in Tombstone. Up and down Allen Street, full-blast 24 hours A day, liquor, hostesses, Gamblin', makin' money hand over Fist. All except the Oriental. On Account of the element. Have a Man for breakfast in there most Days. Regular slaughter house. High-rollers won't go near it. Too bad, nice place.
See what I mean about it getting Spooky?
Curly Bill, huh? Who was that Other idiot?
Curly Bill, huh? Who was that Other idiot?
Ike Clanton, Old Man's eldest Son. Know he ain't got the stuff, Makes him miserable.
Ike Clanton, Old Man's eldest Son. Know he ain't got the stuff, Makes him miserable.
Yeah, and dangerous.
Why don't you just leave it alone?
No, I gotta do something. I don't Suppose you'd card-
No, I gotta do something. I don't Suppose you'd card-
None of my business, Fred.
... What were you saying, Admiral? Something about this 'not being a job for a wine-sniffing, skirt-chasing playboy spy?'
- I'll be sure to acknowledge 007's 'assistance' in my report to the Prime Minister. But this is, still, a naval operation.
- I'll be sure to acknowledge 007's 'assistance' in my report to the Prime Minister. But this is, still, a naval operation.
What do they say in Russia, General Bukharin?
But -
- Thank you, M. But this is more than your man can handle. Are we in agreement?
I appreciate your assistance, M. But this is now a military operation.
Bring up the tracking satellite. And get 007 out of there.
It's too late -
GET BOND OUT OF THERE.
Good evening. I've just spoken with the Prime Minister at the economic summit in Tokyo; he's expecting a full update within the hour. For those of you still unaware, some forty minutes ago -
Excuse me, but - I must formally protest this meeting. Given the nature of what's occurred - and the need for secrecy - I see no reason to involve the air force, the army, or MI-6. This is an internal affair that should be handled strictly by the officers of her Majesty's Royal Navy.

Admiral, are you suggesting -
Why wasn't the ship protected?!?! Why was it sailing without radar?
I resent your tone, sir. I have men who are missing -
I resent your tone, sir. I have men who are missing -
And I have the entire British economy to worry about.
At least we know where the gold is. When are the recovery ships due?
36 hours. They've already sailed from the Persian gulf.
36 hours. They've already sailed from the Persian gulf.
I expect to have that gold recovered in 36 hours. Until then, I'm imposing my own electronic silence: For the sake of the economy, not a word to NATO, the press, the CIA. ...And so long as Commander Bond here seems to be such an expert on these matters, I want him to go along as an observer. Are we agreed?
Always nice to meet one of her Majesty's fellow subjects... Especially one with such distinguished friends.
You might say I've always been one of Mr. Valentin's biggest followers.
It's a beautiful boat, Sir Elliot. Practically glows in the dark.
I can tell you're a man with an eye for exquisite possessions, Mr. Bond. Darling! Come here. I want you to meet my wife.
I hope you've enjoyed this little charade.
Which part? The Colonel's? Or yours?
Which part? The Colonel's? Or yours?
A piece of advice, Mr. Bond: Don't screw with a man who buys ink by the ton. It's deadlier than uranium.
A piece of advice, Mr. Bond: Don't screw with a man who buys ink by the ton. It's deadlier than uranium.
We'll see about that.
How did you get this number?
Oh, please, Mr. Bond. We live in the information age! Information is currency - and with the right currency, you can have any piece of information. Besides I own the phone company. What do you say? Twenty minutes?
Oh, please, Mr. Bond. We live in the information age! Information is currency - and with the right currency, you can have any piece of information. Besides I own the phone company. What do you say? Twenty minutes?
I'm on my way.
Mr. Bond! Nice to see you.
Sir Elliot.
Sir Elliot.
Come. Let's get out of the noise. - I'll give you a tour of the building, then we'll talk.
Before I became involved with Paris, she was always involved with the most inappropriate' men... Playboys. Thrill seekers. Middle aged Peter Pans who only brought out the worst in her.
I see.
I see.
I tried to save her. But she remained a manic depressive: Fits, inappropriate behavior... Delusions of grandeur.
I tried to save her. But she remained a manic depressive: Fits, inappropriate behavior... Delusions of grandeur.
I wonder if it runs in the family.
I wonder if it runs in the family.
The only difference between a psychopath and a genius, Mr. Bond, is the degree of success.
Still, I do miss her. I only wish she could have lived to see all this.
I can feel your pain.
By the way - what is it that brings you to Kuala Lumpur, Mister Bond?
Sightseeing.
I call this the Rogue's gallery.
Yes. I can see: You've hung the rest of your relatives.
Yes. I can see: You've hung the rest of your relatives.
My third great Uncle - the Earl of Aberdeen - negotiated the purchase of Hong Kong from the Chinese. His son-in-law - George Harmsway - made the first family fortune, running opium into Shanghai... His son, Thomas, who lost it, smoking the opium... And my grandfather Henry, who opened the first telegraph station, and published the colony's first English newspaper. It was a city

So why did you leave?
So why did you leave?
Because it's a dying city. Since the Chinese take-over, who knows what can happen tomorrow? In any case, this is my father, Charles: A royal bastard who started the first radio and television stations. Said I'd never amount to anything, but... I turned it into this
Welcome to the new world order, Mr. Bond. Churchill had his armies; Caesar had his legions; I have my divisions: News, sports, business, entertainment. And these are my foot soldiers: 2000 people working on 14 floors to feed 300 newspapers, 4 cable news networks, 87 magazines, and 29 different cable TV channels - in 35 languages.
And still not a thing to watch.
...Although it must be fun to have all those satellites.
They're merely tools to disseminate information.

Or disinformation... If you wanted to, say, beam down a signal to send a ship off course? Maybe one degree a minute?

Fantastic idea Mr. Bond! Perhaps I should buy it for a book! It's totally preposterous, but - You amuse me. ...And now perhaps I can amuse you.
You see, Mr. Bond, you and I are both men of action. But your era is passing. Words are the new weapons; satellites the new artillery. And make no mistake about it: In the right hands, they can be as deadly as your Walther PPK.
...Words to live by?
...Words to live by?
Your choice. Look at the time! Come. There's someone I want you meet - about a story I'm thinking of publishing.
Briefly.
Don't pout, Sidney. I invited him here hoping he might shed some light on your story. He's from 'Lloyd's of London.' ...Aren't you, Mr. Bond?
...And what's that, my dear?
Sidney, perhaps we should leave this to -
I'm sure they will.
Good-bye, Mister Bond.
Are your guards really going to kill a helpless girl?
My guards are from South Africa, Mr. Bond. This is their chance to get even with the formerly 'Great' Britain. Now both of you. Put your hands on your heads, and step forward.
...So that's what the weapons grade uranium was for.
Precisely, Mr. Bond. In a matter of minutes, the boring device will arrive at the core of the reactor... And when the radioactive blades cut into the plutonium -
Precisely, Mr. Bond. In a matter of minutes, the boring device will arrive at the core of the reactor... And when the radioactive blades cut into the plutonium -
- Instant melt-down.
- Instant melt-down.
Chernobyl will look like a campfire.
...As the advertising says: Tomorrow never lies.
What about the gold?
I'd rather die alone.
Take the girl. Leave the handcuffs. We'll drown her at sea.
In the Strait of Malacca, when a boat is even five minutes late, one begins to worry, Mr. Bond.
I know. Pirates from Sumatra want the cargo; smugglers from Thailand and Burma want the ships.

Sometimes kill the crew; other times - Torture them.
Sometimes kill the crew; other times - Torture them.
I'm sorry.

The Kuala Lumpur ferry was 35 miles off-course that night. Captain blamed the auto-pilot; I suspected he was drunk - until the Sumatra ferry captain had same problem.

Maybe you should talk to Sidney Winch. Owns a marine salvage company. Nobody knows more about the Strait.

Where can I find him?
Where can I find him?
Him? He, is a she - at the bar.
I'm sure she is, James. But I'm afraid you'll have to 'kiss off' the rest of your lessons this afternoon.
Moneypenny... Here I was, finally getting a feel for a new tongue -
Moneypenny... Here I was, finally getting a feel for a new tongue -
Four o'clock. M will meet you in the conference room.
4:30. It may take me a little longer to wrap things up here.
Four o'clock. Don't be late.
Four o'clock. Don't be late.
Tsi tien, Chien-penny.
Tsi tien, Chien-penny.
Ah, James. You always were a cunning linguist... Au revoir, mon cher.
Moneypenny! We've got to stop meeting like this. They may be on to us.
Hello, James. Enjoy your meeting?
Hello, James. Enjoy your meeting?
In the darkest moments, it's what I live for. Especially since I've heard how much you like to watch... On the hidden camera.
By the way, James: Ordinarily I would never ask, but... Weren't you and that Colonel once stranded on a raft for two weeks in the Sargasso Sea?
Moneypenny! How indiscreet! Have you ever known me to kiss and tell?
Actually, I've never known you to do either... But -
- We all want what we can't have?
- We all want what we can't have?
Not all of us, 007.
What - no lust for adventure?
No, 007. It's just that I've learned from personal experience - that when we get what we want - Somehow the reality is never as... Satisfying as the fantasy.
Q! How are you?
Retired. I'm not getting paid to help you save the world anymore.
Retired. I'm not getting paid to help you save the world anymore.
I'm sorry. It was a national emergency -
I'm sorry. It was a national emergency -
That hardly makes up for the imposition. Now, for what I hope will be the very last time - pay attention, 007. First, computer generated retrograde analysis map. Body here, meteorolog- ical influences here, likely vector- ing of the ship's coordinates here.

Do you have any idea of what any of that means? In English?

Do I have to dial '9' to get out?

I don't care who you dial, so long as it's not me. Next -
Your new car.
- Four wheel drive?
- Four wheel drive?
Yes. And do try to keep all four of them on the road. All the usual refinements: Smoke, missiles, machine guns - Fully operational remote control. Drives forward, reverse - Stop that! Plus infrared thermal imaging radar, heads up instrumentation, and 17 beverage cup holders.

... 17 Beverage cup holders?
... 17 Beverage cup holders?
Standard equipment. The world's automobile manufacturers seem to be in some kind of mad war to see who can provide the most beverage cup holders.
I must say, Q, you seem to be doing rather well in your retirement.
Don't even think about it. 007. They're my granddaughters.
Yes -
Guard! Arrest these men! Escort them to the cutter!
Wait a minute -
Get them out of here. If he says one word, shoot him.
Don't you think you're overreacting?
Yes. The famous James Bond. I've heard all about you, sir. You were under direct orders to act as an observer - and yet you had to go off, on your own, like some half-assed CIA cowboy - Endangering the gold, attracting that lunatic woman, and then putting in a distress call for us to save your bloody hide.

What are you talking about? We went through all this and the ship isn't even down there?

Yes, the ship is down there. But the gold is gone.
Yes, the ship is down there. But the gold is gone.
That's absurd! It took two squads of forty men fifteen days to load that gold.

I know what I saw -
Paris?!? What are you doing here?
Is that any way to say hello?
Is that any way to say hello?
I thought your specialty was good-bye.
Oh, James. I've missed you -
Is this another one of your games?
Is this another one of your games?
Stop it! You're hurting me! Can't you just be nice?
Stop it! You're hurting me! Can't you just be nice?
I've got half the British government breathing down my neck. I don't have time for your nonsense.
Don't you even miss me? Didn't I mean anything to you?
Nothing.
What about Elliot Harmsway? Or is this just another one of your stunts?
No! He's crazy - he's insane. He hates everybody. He's got these plans - You've got to help me, James. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything. I know I was wrong - but you've got to protect me. I know you still love -
Do you feel better now?
Do you?
What about the uranium?
It's on the boat. He's holding a press conference tomorrow.
I'm so sorry, James. I promise, I'll never leave you again.
Shhhhh...
Shhhhh...
Just hold me.
Paris -
Leave me alone! He's going to kill me!!
Leave me alone! He's going to kill me!!
Why didn't you tell me? Why wasn't it in our files?
Why didn't you tell me? Why wasn't it in our files?
He didn't want anyone to know. He kept it out of the papers. He said a third wife was bad for his image. You've got to protect me!
Just - say it. Say it just once.
One thing at a time. I'll see you in twenty minutes. Go.
His newspapers?
Occasionally, yes. British media mogul. Born in Hong Kong; controls newspapers, TV, radio, cable, satellites; books, magazines, movies, computer software. Theme parks.
More scurrilous, unsubstantiated gossip.
Perhaps. But it does explain how an ex-KGB agent turned illegal-arms dealer is suddenly portrayed as a long-time friend of the people. If you believe what you read in the papers.

Need I remind the two of you that Elliot Harmsway - Sir Elliot Harmsway - is directly descended from the Earl of Aberdeen? That his Scottish ancestors practically invented Hong Kong - and out of sheer gratitude, Queen Victoria herself named the port "Aberdeen Harbor" in their honor?
There is one last thing, 007: Elliot Harmsway is vital to the economic interests of this nation. He's also a major contributor to the party. I expect him to be given every consideration.
Political considerations?
Political considerations?
To the best of my recollection, Mr. Bond, I suggested no such thing. In fact, I was never here.
Okay, Saunders. What is it this time? Rocket in the leg? Machine pistol in the arm?
Q's retirement party. I'd just put the knife into the cake, and -
Q's retirement party. I'd just put the knife into the cake, and -
Come on. I know better than that -
It must do something.
Well... If you insist.
Now pay attention, 007. We haven't much time to demonstrate your new Q toys.
How is old Q?
How is old Q?
Gone fishing.
Gone fishing.
Fishing?
Fishing?
Big game fishing. Sonar torpedoes. Retirement gift from his friends at the CIA.
Saunders, I've lit cigarettes -
Not from forty feet.
... Shoelaces?
Plastique explosive shoelaces. Cut them to regulate the size of the blast; totally harmless until you attach the detonator hidden in the heel of your shoe.

Oh. I almost forgot. There is one last thing: Before Q retired, he asked that I give you one other protective device.
A wedding band??? What am I supposed to be able to do with this?
I believe Q's exact words were: "Hopefully, nothing."
Wade, what the hell are you doing here?
I am not here, ol' buddy. The CIA has absolutely no knowledge of the missing ship, the missing gold, where it was going, or when it left Hong Kong.

Let's take a look at the body.
I don't know if you'd call it a boat...
Something with an engine? Not oars?

What do you want with the Harbor Master?
Tide and current charts. Work backward from the body - find where the ship sank. Where did you get the boat?

Seized it from a guy smuggling computer chips out of Bangkok. Should have seen his rose garden: Blooms the size of hand grenades.
I think I've just seen my next future ex-wife.
Not if you kill us first - unless that's how you plan to leave Muffy.

Yeah. Russian Minister of Transportation.

Yo! Jimbo! I won five hundred - What happened?
He tied one on.
I dunno, Jimbo. It can't be out here. How could they get this far off course?
Who knows? Fog, night...

Wait a minute - I've got it. There! Off the port bow!
I got you covered.
That's reassuring.
Sidney Winch, meet -
Jack Wade. Citibank. Commercial loan division. If you're ever lookin' for a sweet refinance on the boat -
Where to now, Jimbo?
I'm not certain... But I think there's someone I want to press for some answers in Kuala Lumpur.

Depends what number you write.
Married?
Happily.

Three. You? Married?
Three. You? Married?
No.
No.
I didn't think so.
Here. I gave you my assistant's phone number. If it's urgent, she knows where to reach me.
Thanks. Take care -
Thanks. Take care -
You too.
Bourbon. Neat.
I wonder if you handle your liquor more carefully than you handle your boat.
Sometimes, you just have to plunge into things. Be reckless.
- And I bet you always leave turmoil in your wake.

Vodka martini, shaken not stirred. And another for you?
No. But you can buy a drink for my friend, Taro.
Boyfriend?
Chaperone. I'm waiting for my dinner date.

So what brings you to Kuala Lumpur, Mr. Bond? Wait - don't tell me: Unhappy marriage? Running from some poor little girl with two kids and a Chanel pocketbook in - London?
Actually, I'm here on business. You might say it was a... Golden opportunity.
And exactly what business are you in, Mr. Bond?
And exactly what business are you in, Mr. Bond?
Insurance. Lloyds of London.
Insurance. Lloyds of London.
The Strait can be a very dangerous place, Mr. Bond. A few words scribbled on a piece of paper in London doesn't carry a lot of value out here. Including life insurance.

I'll keep that in mind.

Nice to run into you again.

Let's not make it a habit.
- Shut up!
You have to excuse Miss Winch: She thinks she's on a 'seduce and destroy' mission through life... ...But she won't kill us.

No?
No?
No. First, because I don't think it's in your nature. And second, because there's no gold down there.
No. First, because I don't think it's in your nature. And second, because there's no gold down there.
So charming! So suave! Don't insult me. I'm not one of your 'little London girls' who falls for the lies.
Do I have to do everything around here?
I hope so.
I hope you'll be gentle.
Think about mom.
And what do you call this?
- The family jewels?
If I were you -
- You're not.
- You're not.
Just remember: They think there's ten billion dollars in gold down there.

Thank you. "Now hear this: Drop dead."
Why don't we just take these -
No. I want Sir Elliot to keep them.
... Do you have a gun?
What?
What?
You heard me. A gun? I left mine in the car.

That's funny: you struck me as the kind of man who always carries protection.

Listen to me! I'm a British secret service agent. And we have about two minutes before Harmsway kills both of us.
Harmsway sank that ship and stole the gold. It's on the Sea Dolphin II. And thanks to your little show and tell - - giving him the evidence - We're the only ones who can tie him to the crime.
Elliot Harmsway is my Uncle!

Maybe. But why are we going up instead of down?
This has got to be a mistake.
The only mistake is that they didn't kill us in the elevator.
Wait here.
No. I'm going with you.
... How did you get into marine salvage?
My father left me the business.
Not a lot of difference.
What do you mean?
What the hell does that do?
Cleans dirt. Let's go.
Down?
Up.
What now? And don't give me some movie cliché like 'trust me.'
Trust me.
Put your back to the railing. Sit up on it.
Are you listening to me?
Are you listening to me?
Put your arms around my neck. Lock your legs around my waist.

... We have time for that?
Sometimes you just have to -
Don't say it.
Is this - like - a normal day for you?
It's a lousy job, but - The only reason I stay is for the health benefits.
Here. You shoot. I'll drive.
...You know, that's another reason you're probably not in a successful relationship.

You insist on calling all the shots. And by the way: I am not a helpless girl.
If it's radio controlled, it'll break the code.
If not?
If not?
We blast through.
Sleep well?
Next time, I do the driving.
What do you mean, you'd rather die alone?
I didn't say when I want to die -
... Yes???
Before we go any further here, Mr. Bond, from Lloyds of London, I just want to get two things straight.

If you think we're going to have some kind of 'life affirming' romance here just because we cheated death, let me be clear: We're going to have it where I want, and when I want.

Thank you Colonel Everhart. 007, I'd like to see you in my office. Why don't you and the Colonel exchange numbers if you need more information?
Yes, M.
Come in, 007. You know the Minister?
Of course. Minister Johnstone.
Tell me, 007, what do you know about Elliot Harmsway?
Only what I read in the newspapers.
- Along with Tomorrow - the first world-wide newspaper. Circulation 27 million. Daily. -
'Able to topple governments with a single story' - as he says in his press.
... What's Harmsway done?
It seems, 007, we've received a tip
The reason I invited the Minister here, 007, was to reassure him that this investigation will be handled with the utmost discretion.
Of course.
Of course.
Which is also why I've withheld this information from NATO and our allies.
Which is also why I've withheld this information from NATO and our allies.
... Didn't we once investigate Harmsway?
... Didn't we once investigate Harmsway?
Yes. 1988. He was furious at the British plan to return Hong Kong, and supposedly started his own negotiations with the Chinese Government. The inquiry went nowhere - but it did earn MI-6 a rather powerful enemy -
You're to wear this mask at the Venice Carnival, and wait to be contacted.
I understand.
.... I hate to ask, but... Did you ever think you'd miss Communism?
We serve the interests of the British people, 007. No matter who we may be foolish enough to elect.
But if Elliot Harmsway is involved with that uranium, I want him prosecuted to the ends of the earth.
Hopefully, it won't get that far.
...I'll give you a ring from Venice.
Good luck on your mission, 007.
Sorry I'm late -
Actually, you're just in time. Admiral Roebuck: You know Commander Bond, don't you?
...You're turning into quite the politician, 007.
I have an excellent teacher. 'Make sure you wear the uniform'?

What do you make of all this?
What do you make of all this?
It doesn't quite add up.
The infrared satellite images. No heat, no flame, no explosion. If that boat went down where they said it did, there should have been some residual heat reading on the surface.
Sabotage?
Sabotage?
A three-thousand ton frigate doesn't just vanish into thin air.
... And what do you call these?
Ja-shwa tsway. These are lips.
Ja-shwa tsway. These are lips.
Indeed they are. Deadly little things.
And what do you call these? The Gang of Two?
Stop it!
Stop it!

Excellent.
Damn. It's doing it again.
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
About every ninety seconds, the auto- pilot jogs us to the west.
The back-up does the same thing.
Check it again. What about the global positioning satellite? Could there be something wrong with the signal?
How is it now?
Seems to be back to normal, sir.
A dead head. Water logged timber. Floats straight up. You sometimes see them on the east side of the channel - from the logging camps on Sumatra - but they don't usually float this far west. Muncy! Engines to half!
Aye-aye sir. Engines to half.
Aye-aye sir. Engines to half.
Chew up a log like that in the propeller, you end up with enough paperwork to go from here to London. Twice.
What is HE doing here?
I see you two have met.
Obviously, the British government denies all of this -
- I told you! He was there! -
- I told you! He was there! -
- But as I've explained to Sidney, without proof, there's just no story. Don't you agree Mr. Bond?
He brought that up from the wreck.
...I see.
...Well! I do believe this requires further investigation!
Thank you, Uncle Elliot.
Thank you, Uncle Elliot.
No matter what the British government says, I won't kill this story. Miss Oxford will show both of you to the elevator... And one of my people will definitely be in touch sooner than later.
How sweet.
My timing always was lousy.
That was too close.
Don't worry. Mr. Bond will get the message. So will his boss.
The drill is in the water; approaching the intake tunnel.
Excellent.
Please, Sidney. I'd like to remember you fondly.
Approaching the first gate.
Approaching the first gate.
Start the grinders.
Bore through. ...They used to say living well was the best revenge, Mr. Bond. They're wrong. Revenge is the best revenge.
Entering the main tunnel - ten minutes to target -
Hong Kong, Mr. Bond!
You have to leave -
You have to leave -
A hundred and fifty years ago, my ancestors took this island - a barren, lifeless rock - and turned it into the greatest city known to modern civilization. And now that I'm being forced to give it back, I intend to return it in exactly the same condition: A barren, lifeless rock. The gold is merely reparations - payment from the spineless British government
Take the men. I can finish alone.
You come with me - You stay here.
Is the helicopter ready?
Fueled and waiting.
Fueled and waiting.
Good. We have an appointment in Hong Kong.
It's a trick! After him. They're in the south stairwell!
Get more men up there!
They're on the bridge. Seal off the 50th floor!
I should have hired this man. Get somebody up there!
- Built to withstand a nuclear blast. Are they alive?
Yes. Shall we kill them?
Yes. Shall we kill them?
No. I have a better idea. In fact, Mr. Bond may have actually improved my original plan. Bring them both to Hong Kong. And Make sure he has nothing else up his sleeve.
What the hell is going on?
It's Bond!
It's Bond!
Kill him! Finish it!
I regret to inform you, sir, that Saddam Hussein is still demanding a bonus for his role in the Gulf War.
...Haven't we already paid him for his services?
...Haven't we already paid him for his services?
Yes, sir. But he still feels his people should share in the increased profits of our news division. He has proposed an additional 500 million dollar payment.
... And there's no truth that 10% of that money will go into your Swiss bank account?
No sir! I swear! This is not true!!
No sir! I swear! This is not true!!
You disappoint me, Number Three.
Please sir. Please -
...But because I am a just man, I've decided to give Mr. Hussein what he deserves.
Mr. Stamper will escort you to the plane.
Thank you sir! Thank you!
What about ID's?

Since when?
Your mother asked me not to mention it but your mother's birthday was last week.
I hadn't forgotten. I ordered some cloth but it didn't come in and I felt so bad if I would have come to her birthday without that, I just stayed at home.

What did your wife get her?

We got the same thing.
Why, you don't want us to bring him over?
No, it's that when do you have time to be parents to him? You guys don't pick him up until nine, ten at night. You are into yourselves, as the saying goes. Spend some time trying to be parents. Take him to the mountains, fishing. You ought to let him get to know nature.

Soon as I rest a bit. I meant as soon as we are back to normal again, anytime.

Why are you always afraid to get somewhere?

That is a damn lie and you know it. Every time father asks you to do something, you either half-ass do it or run off and hide. Mama asked you to turn the dirt in her garden and you told her, with your smart ass self, that you weren't a farmer; get Junior to do it. Every time someone asks you to do something,

I told you about calling me boy. I ain't no boy. See, you and Dad got a bad habit of calling me boy. You call me boy in front of my wife. You think I'm going to fix the roof? I hope the wind blows the whole damn thing off and it pours down rain.

I'm cold. I need to get out into the sunlight.
What is it, noontime?
Because you were spoiled, don't try to spoil Sunny.
My daddy never gave me anything without my having to sweat for it. Every summer, the way they kept me and Junior out of trouble was to send us to Big Daddy's farm. We would get up with the chickens. Every summer the fence had to be repaired. The barn needed a coat of paint. We had to pip all of Big Mama's hundred

I don't want to wear out welcome, but you can stay in someone's heart longer than you can stay in their house. Come with us, boy. We are going to have a good time.
This would be a bad time for me to leave.
This would be a bad time for me to leave.
We are going where the action is. Ain't that right, Okra? Let's play for a couple of bucks unless you want to start off with two bits and work our way up. What would you give to be rich?
You know it is against the city ordinance to keep chickens or live stock.
I always had chickens, ducks and whatnots.

Not anymore, not in the city.

We grow most of our own food. The money I get from social security, my pension and my wife's work, keeps us living on the edge. What choice do people like us have.

Well, you just have to move further out.

Now how far would further out be?

I'm not here to argue, sir.
My mind plays tricks on me. Is it okay if I take a bath now?
Everyone is gone. Rhonda is in the bathroom.
Babe Brother and his wife are taking advantage of a situation. I hate to be mean to people but picking Sunny up when they feel like it has to come to an end. Now I'm going to ask him how come he couldn't be at your birthday.
Don't bother the poor boy. It just takes some people a little longer to figure out who they are.

I don't know how two brothers can be so different.
Let us settle this tomorrow.
Look! Don't try to get ahead by riding our backs.
Your feet are cold.
Go back to sleep.

You're going to find yourself on the floor.
You know, Babe Brother's wife just dumps greens in the pot without washing them.
Babe Brother is a poor boy.
Well, it's up to Suzie.
It would be nice.
Do you want your coat? It's cold out here.
No, I'm too hot now.

You better be careful. You'll get a stroke arguing.

Gideon, don't say things like that.
Let us go back in before the night of celebration becomes a night of me killing my son.
No. Before anyone moves, you two shake hands and don't carry it any further.
I'm worn out.
Just stay in bed and rest.

Since this morning.
What happened to your hand?
What happened to your hand?
I cut it on an old rusty knife.
What did you put on it?
It's healing now.
He's going to check out heaven first. He gets a round trip ticket to heaven. He gets in heaven and finds it just like back home. People dripping with sweat, working in the fields, hardly surviving. He asked a man who was getting a drink of water, "I thought the streets were paved with gold." "They are but you won't see them," he said.

This is my grandson, Sunny. He is my youngest son's child.
He kind of favors one of my boys when he was about his age.
Boy, that is bad luck to touch a fellow with a broom.
He knows better. Sunny, apologize to Harry.
I came all the way from Detroit by bus going to Oakland. The bus stopped in Los Angeles. I had to get off and take a rest. I'll catch the last bus leaving at midnight. I'm just too tired to go on.
Why didn't you catch a plane?

I'm worn out but won't you feel like you are taking in a stranger?
Man, put your boxes down and stay as long as you like. We have empty rooms since the boys got their own families and moved out.
Well if you're sure, I won't be a bother. Oh, I don't sleep on no spring mattress. I always make myself a pallet on the floor.
Man, act like this is your home.
That's awful generous of you. I always ask to keep from wearing out welcome.
It's the boy next door throwing at his birds. I'm just waiting on him to hit a pane in the window
I'm going to wash up now. You all please excuse me.
Good morning.
You ought to come hear our preacher. Remember old Cat Iron? Well, our preacher is just as strong.

Oh, I would feel much at home if you let me get one for you. I haven't wrung a chicken's neck in a month of Sundays. You know, folks would call my daddy to kill their hogs. That used to be my trade from time to time.

How often is your wife called to help delivery?
It was slow. Now it seems like everyone is having births at home.
What could have caused this? I just changed this damn thing.
Everything these days is made overseas.

Everyone has to follow his own plough. A man doesn't have to know how to cut a wick and clean a chimney nowadays. City people don't give a hoot and a holler about the shape of the moon nowadays. You don't plant old ways... ... but, at the end, you find yourself doing what your father did but you have to have the land

Haven't the years been good to Hattie?
It hasn't been the years; it's been the men in her life.
Boy, I thought you were about to cross the river.
I tell you, I feel like a ghost.
Stranger my foot, it was my grandmother who helped you into this world.
Well, I don't want to put you out.
Good evening. It must be all the different time zones I crossed that makes me feel this weary.
You should go back and rest.
You should go back and rest.
No, if I rest any longer, I won't sleep tonight. May I use your bathroom to wash up a bit?
One can tell you are from back home. These people nowadays don't know what manners are.
Where we come from, you had to know how to act right. You had to know how to say yes sir and no sir. You had to know your place.
Those days you could always find something redeeming about even the worst person.
You remember that boy who lost his mind, Joe? You could hear him pitching horseshoes at night in the dark. He wouldn't miss a one. Make him mad and call yourself running in the house to be safe. He would pick up a brick and say "go on in there brick and hit somebody" and it would find its mark.

All those places that us coloreds lived, that we used to call Bottoms, have all been changed to Drives and Heights. Everything is in what you call it, not in what it is.
I have someone I want you to meet.
I'll be right there.
Harry, you know everything.
You got to know everything, do everything, and be everything.
What's the problem here?
She has a fish bone caught in her throat. Could all of you go in the other room? Gideon, get some bread and toast it quickly and find me the cod liver oil.
How is everybody?
Tolerable well.
Ah, you young folks don't know how it is. How is Gideon today?
He wasn't able to get out of bed today.

Let me earn my keep. I'll go out and get a hen and have it picked and ready for the pot. Try to make him some cow tea next time.
Can you watch Gideon for a while? One of the girls is going into labor. Junior is going to drive me over.
You just run along. I'll fix him his soup. He will be all right.
That smells like fresh coffee.
Let me get you a cup?

Only if you can spare it.
How is he doing?
As long as he keeps his throat clear, he is able to get some rest.

Good afternoon, ladies.

As God is my witness, I have never done anything to that woman.

You know as well as I do that it was made to look like he was lynched. Now who would hang someone from a persimmon tree?
What difference does it make if it's persimmon, oak tree or huckleberry bush?
Hocker's death almost caused a race riot. A lot of innocent people could have been hurt behind that.
Strange as it may seem, it might have cleared the waters. Sometimes the right action comes from the wrong reason.
I think if anybody had a hand in killing Hocker, you ought to ask or you should have asked Emory and Chick.
Chick was outright killed by a mob. He killed a white man that owed him some money and when they caught up with him, they tied him behind a car and dragged him from out of the hills back to town.

How many people do you all feed?
Last Saturday we handed out over two hundred meals.

Of course not. Have you ever heard of a man jumping in the river to save five hundred drowning people? No you ain't. You have to take just one and fatten him up. When you spread help too thin, you , you just nickel and dime the situation. If you try to save all, all die but if you save one life, life goes
I don't know if we could take one in with Rhonda and me at home alone at times.
Oh, I wasn't pointing my finger at you. Hey, you have to think of yourself. A lot of them have all kinds of diseases and will cut your throat while you sleep. There are too many bad people out there.
I couldn't believe it when Suzie called and said you were staying here. How have you been?
Girl, do you still sing and dance?

No, I'm a different person now, Harry.
Harry, that's not nice. I'm in church now.
Why run out and close the barn door when the horse is gone? I remember when you weren't saved. That was way back yonder when the Natchez Trace was just a dirt road.

An empty wagon makes a lot of noise and you, tappy head, you ain't worth the salt you put in greens.
Speaking of tappy heads, we ought to have an old fashion fish fry.
Is this your house?
Oh. I'm sorry. Gideon, what do you say?
In the meantime Harry can slaughter us a hog.
I already have, my dear.
I appreciate you lending me a hand. That lazy ass brother of mine was suppose to help me.
Well some folks are still waiting for their comeuppance. Don't take me wrong but you can't judge people by how you act. You're a caring person.

Ya, but you can't do the shuffle with one leg. You and your wife, in your spare time, work with the less fortunate. Now I'm not talking about you and what you do but some folks that always run to help the victim, deep down are attracted to pain and suffering and love to be near the dying.

You never know what's in the heart and just because you can cry doesn't make you human.
You don't act like the rest of Gideon's friends. They believe if you are not hard at work, you are hard at sin.
Oh, I'm more modern in my ways. I don't believe in sin, though there is good and evil. And evil is a thing you work at.
Not you mustn't touch. Your mama might not like you handling knives.

You don't want to be at crossroads without one. It's a charm that old people teach you how to make. I had one for a long time that belonged to my grandmother who had it ever since she was a child. In my travels I misplaced it. I have been looking over my shoulder ever since.

Did you have your child at home?
No. No. No. No. I had my Child at Cedars and Sinai. And that ain't no county hospital. You have to have cash or check before you come in the door.

I haven't heard anyone mention Swamp Root since button-up shoes went out.
You know Harry lied about how that boy Hocker got kilt. And it was Harry who saw Emory last before they found him hanging over a levee like someone would hang a hog.
I remember Harry always trying to help someone. He got Lulla's daughter out of trouble. He was always running to the store for someone who couldn't leave the house.

Harry always shows his good side and, like the moon, the other side is black. Back home he always did try to act like the colored gentleman. I'm telling you Harry is nothing but evil. I'm warning you -- you can't keep a wild animal as a pet around children.

Rush your mouth, girl. No, he didn't. He cannot be that big of a damn fool.

Where does her get the power to summon all his old raffish friends? They all smell of moth balls.
Now you don't have to say anything if you don't want to.
I want to hear what happened. My brother is a jackass and a damn fool. The both of you have been as scarce as hen's teeth.
You shouldn't talk about the boy's father in front of him. This is family business and we have to pull together.
Whether the boy hears it or not, the man is still a jackass. Everyone should have some mother wit.

But what if we leave them behind?
But what if we leave them behind?
Oh, don't worry, honey, I'm sure we'll find Woody and Buzz before we leave tomorrow.
Everybody say, "Bye, house."

Well sure, look at him. He's got more gadgets on him then a Swiss army knife.
Uh, let what? I don't -- Uh, what do you mean? Who?
I know Andy's excited about Buzz, but you know, he'll always have a special place for you.
What are you doing over there?
It's a long story, Bo. I'll explain later. Here, catch this!
We're almost there.
Rocky! The ramp!
Whoooooah! Oh! Bo! There's gotta be a less painful way to get my attention.
Merry Christmas, Sheriff.
Say, isn't that mistletoe?
Mm-hmmmmm.
Hello-o-o...
HO-YAAAHH!!!
Yes, it is a mistake, because, you see, the bed, here, is my spot.
I need to repair my turbo boosters. Do you people still use fossil fuels, or have you discovered crystalic fusion?
I need to repair my turbo boosters. Do you people still use fossil fuels, or have you discovered crystalic fusion?
Well, let's see, we've got double A's --
Well, let's see, we've got double A's --
Watch yourself!!
Yes. They're Andy's toys.
Alright, everyone. You're clear to come up.
Toy?
T-O-Y. Toy.
T-O-Y. Toy.
Excuse me, I think the word you're searching for is Space Ranger.
Excuse me, I think the word you're searching for is Space Ranger.
The word I'm searching for I can't say because there's pre-school toys present.
He's not a Space Ranger! He doesn't fight evil or shoot lasers or fly --
Excuse me.
They are a terillium-carbonic alloy and I CAN fly.
No, you can't.
No, you can't.
Yes, I can.
Yes, I can.
You can't!
You can't!
Can!
Can!
Can't! Can't! Can't!
Can't! Can't! Can't!
I tell you, I could fly around this room with my eyes closed!
I tell you, I could fly around this room with my eyes closed!
Okay then, Mr. Lightbeer! Prove it.
Okay then, Mr. Lightbeer! Prove it.
All right, then, I will. Stand back everyone!
Why, thank you. Thank you all. Thank you.
That wasn't flying! That was falling with style!
Listen, Lightsnack, you stay away from Andy. He's mine, and no one is taking him away from me.
What are you talking about? Where's that bonding strip?!
And another thing. Stop with this spaceman thing. It's getting on my nerves.
Are you saying you want to lodge a complaint with Star Command? WOODY Oh okay, so you want to do it the hard way, huh?
Don't even think about it, cowboy!
Oh, yeah, tough guy?!
You actually think you're THE "Buzz Lightyear?" Oh, all this time I thought it was an act! Hey, guys! Look! It's the REAL Buzz Lightyear!
You're mocking me, aren't you?
You're mocking me, aren't you?
Oh, no, no, no... Buzz, look! An alien!
Oh, no, no, no... Buzz, look! An alien!
Where?
What's going on?
Nothing that concerns you spacemen. Just us TOYS.
Nothing that concerns you spacemen. Just us TOYS.
I'd better take a look anyway.
Why is that soldier strapped to an explosive device?
That's why. Sid.
That's why. Sid.
Sure is a hairy fellah.
Sure is a hairy fellah.
No! No, that's Scud, you idiot!
THAT is Sid!
You mean that happy child?
I could have stopped him.
Buzz, I would love to see you try. 'Course I'd love to see you as a crater.
Buzz!! Oh, Buzz, Buzz Lightyear!! Buzz Lightyear, thank goodness! We've got trouble!
Trouble?! Where?!
Trouble?! Where?!
Down there. Just down there. A helpless toy...it's...it's trapped, Buzz!
Down there. Just down there. A helpless toy...it's...it's trapped, Buzz!
Then we've no time to lose!!
Right? Buddy?
I just want you to know that even though you tried to terminate me, revenge is not an idea we promote on my planet.
I just want you to know that even though you tried to terminate me, revenge is not an idea we promote on my planet.
Oh. Oh, that's good.
Oh. Oh, that's good.
But we're not on my planet, are we?
But we're not on my planet, are we?
No.
According to my nava-computer, the --
Shut up! Just shut up, you idiot!!
Shut up! Just shut up, you idiot!!
Sheriff, this is no time to panic.
Sheriff, this is no time to panic.
This is the perfect time to panic! I'm lost, Andy is gone, they're going to move from their house in two days and it's all your fault!!
This is the perfect time to panic! I'm lost, Andy is gone, they're going to move from their house in two days and it's all your fault!!
My fault?! If you hadn't pushed me out of the window in the first place --
My fault?! If you hadn't pushed me out of the window in the first place --
Oh, yeah? Well, if YOU hadn't shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to me --
Oh, yeah? Well, if YOU hadn't shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to me --
Don't talk to me about importance. Because of YOU the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy.
Don't talk to me about importance. Because of YOU the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy.
WHAT?!! What are you talking about?!
Buzz! Buzz, come back!
Go away.
Now you're sure this spacefreighter will return to its port of origin once it jettisons its food supply?
Uh-huh. And when we get there, we'll be able to find a way to transport you...home.
Uh-huh. And when we get there, we'll be able to find a way to transport you...home.
Well, then let's climb abroad.
No, no, no, wait, Buzz, Buzz, let's get in the back. No one will see us there.
Negative. There are no restraining harnesses in the cargo area. We'll be much safer in the cockpit.
Ow! Watch where you're going!
Sorry.
Wait a minute! No Buzz! This way! There's a special ship. I just saw it!
You mean it has hyperdrive?
You mean it has hyperdrive?
Hyper-active hyperdrive, and astro...uh, turf.
C'mon, c'mon, that's it...
Where is it? I don't see the --
Spaceship.
Alright Buzz, get ready...
What's gotten into you, Sheriff? I was --
YOU are the one that decided to climb into this --
I've set my laser from stun to kill.
Oh, great, great. Yeah, and if anyone attacks us we can blink 'em to death.
I sure hope this isn't permanent.
Still no word from Star Command. We're not that far from the spaceport --
Woody, we don't know what's out there!
I'll tell you what's -- AAAAH!
They're gonna eat us, Buzz!! Do something! Quick!
Shield your eyes!
It's not working. I recharged it before I left. It should be good for hours --
Oh, you idiot! You're a toy! Use your karate chop action!
Get away! Hoo-cha! Hoo-cha!
Hey!! Hey! How are you doing that? Stop that!
Hey!! Hey! How are you doing that? Stop that!
Back! Back, you savages! Back!
Woody, stop it!!
Sorry guys, but dinner's canceled!
Another stunt like that, cowboy -- you're going to get us killed.
Don't tell me what to do!
Don't tell me what to do!
Shhh!
What happened to you?
One minute you're defending the whole galaxy... ...and suddenly you find yourself suckin' down Darjeeling with Marie Antoinette and her little sisters.
I think you've had enough tea for today. Let's get you out of here, Buzz.
Don't you get it?! You see the hat? I am Mrs. Nesbit!!
Oh, I'm a sham!!
Sh-h-h-h-h!! Quiet, Buzz.
Sh-h-h-h-h!! Quiet, Buzz.
Look at me! I can't even fly out of a window!
But -- the hat looked good. Tell me the hat looked good! The apron is a bit much, it's not my color...
Out the window...Buzz, you're a genius!
Come on, this way!
Years of Academy training...wasted!!
Oh, come on, Buzz. I...Buzz, I can't do this without you. I need your help.
I can't help. I can't help anyone.
I can't help. I can't help anyone.
Why, sure you can, Buzz. You can get me out of here and then I'll get that rocket off you, and we'll make a break for Andy's house.
Why, sure you can, Buzz. You can get me out of here and then I'll get that rocket off you, and we'll make a break for Andy's house.
Andy's house. Sid's house. What's the difference.
Andy's house. Sid's house. What's the difference.
Oh, Buzz, you've had a big fall. You must not be thinking clearly.
Oh, Buzz, you've had a big fall. You must not be thinking clearly.
No, Woody, for the first time I am thinking clearly. You were right all along. I'm not a Space Ranger. I'm just a toy. A stupid little insignificant toy.
No, Woody, for the first time I am thinking clearly. You were right all along. I'm not a Space Ranger. I'm just a toy. A stupid little insignificant toy.
Whoa, hey -- wait a minute. Being a toy is a lot better than being a Space Ranger.
Whoa, hey -- wait a minute. Being a toy is a lot better than being a Space Ranger.
Yeah, right.
Yeah, right.
No, it is. Look, over in that house is a kid who thinks you are the greatest, and it's not because you're a Space Ranger, pal, it's because you're a TOY! You are HIS toy.
No, it is. Look, over in that house is a kid who thinks you are the greatest, and it's not because you're a Space Ranger, pal, it's because you're a TOY! You are HIS toy.
But why would Andy want me?
But why would Andy want me?
Why would Andy want you?! Look at you! You're a Buzz Lightyear. Any other toy would give up his moving parts just to be you. You've got wings, you glow in the dark, you talk, your helmet does that -- that whoosh thing -- you are a COOL toy.
Buzz!! What are you doing? I thought you were --
Come on, Sheriff. There's a kid over in that house who needs us. Now let's get you out of this thing.
Come on, Sheriff. There's a kid over in that house who needs us. Now let's get you out of this thing.
Yes Sir!
Woody! It's the moving van.
We've got to get out of here...NOW.
Shhhhhhh!
What?!
What?!
It's ok. Everything's under control.
Nice work, fellahs. Good job. Comin' out of the ground -- what a touch! That was a stroke of genius.
Woody!
Hold on, Woody!
I can't do it! Take care of Andy for me!
I can't do it! Take care of Andy for me!
NO-O-O-O-O-O-O!!
Well, thanks for the ride.
Look out!!
Great!
Woody! The rocket!
Woody! The rocket!
The match!
Woody?! What are you doing?
Hold still, Buzz!
Ha-ha!!
You did it! Next stop. Andy.
Ahhh!! This is the part where we blow up!
Not today!
Hey, Buzz!! You're flying!!
This isn't flying. This is falling -- with style!
This isn't flying. This is falling -- with style!
Ha ha!! To Infinity and Beyond!!
Uh, Buzz?! We missed the truck!
We're not aiming for the truck!
Me? No, no, no, no... Are you?
Now Buzz, what could Andy possibly get that is worse than you?!
It doesn't matter how much we're played with. What matters is that we're here for Andy when he needs us. That's what we're made for. Right? Everyone is now looking down, sheepish.
Pardon me. I hate to break up the staff meeting, but THEY'RE HERE! Birthday guests at three o'clock!
Pardon me. I hate to break up the staff meeting, but THEY'RE HERE! Birthday guests at three o'clock!
Stay calm, everyone!!
No, no! Turn 'em around, turn 'em around!
Eh, he's puttin' 'em in backwards!
Eh, he's puttin' 'em in backwards!
Plus is positive, minus is negative! Oh, let me!
It's not a laser! It's a little lightbulb that blinks!
What's with him?
Oh, impressive wingspan. Very good!
Oh, what?!...What?! These are plastic. He can't fly!
Hi!
Everyone, it's Woody!
Something's screwy here.
So, you see? We're friends now, guys. Aren't we, Buzz? You bet. Gimme a hug.
Oh, boy. Will ya take a look at all those presents?!
I can't see a thing!
Hey, watch it!
Sorry there, old Spudhead.
Let's string him up by his pull- string!
I got dibs on his hat!
B-3.
Miss. G-6.

Heh-heh.
Heh-heh.

Are you peeking?
Oh, quit your whining and pay up.
No, no, not the ear. Gimme the nose. C'mon!
How 'bout three out of five?
Son of a building block, it's Woody!
He's in the psycho's bedroom!
Oh, that is disgusting.
Murderer!
What?
Did I get my package in the mail?
Did I get my package in the mail?
I dunno.

NO-O-O... Don't touch her! NO!
Sid, give her back! Give her back now! I'm telling!
Patient is... ...pre-e-epped.
MOM!! MOM!!
She's lying! Whatever she says it's not true!
Oh, no!
Oh, ya big lizard! Now we'll never know what it is!
Where's my ear? Who's seen my ear? Did you see my ear?
Outta my way! Here I come, here I come --
Well, that MISTAKE is sitting in your spot, Woody.
Have you been replaced?
Oh, really? I'm from Playskool.
And I'm from Mattel. Well, I'm not actually from Mattel, I'm actually from a smaller company that was purchased in a leveraged buy-out. Well, I don't really understand the financials, but...
Gettin' kind of tense, aren't you?
Oh, uh, Mr. Lightyear? Now I'm curious. What does a Space Ranger actually do?
That ain't no happy child.
He tortures toys -- just for fun.
Huh?! Huh?! I told you he was guilty.
Who would've thought he was capable of such atrocities?!
Aa-a-a-a-ah!
Will you quit moving around?!
Will you quit moving around?!
I'm sorry. It's just that I get so nervous before I travel.
I'm sorry. It's just that I get so nervous before I travel.
How did I get stuck with YOU as a moving buddy?
Well, obviously she wanted to have the party before the move. I'm not worried. You shouldn't be worried.
Of course Woody ain't worried! He's been Andy's favorite since kindergarten!
A lunchbox?!
A lunchbox...?!
Laser-envy.
All right, that's enough. Look, we're all very impressed with Andy's new toy --
Yeah. Like the attic. Heh, heh...
Alright! That's it!
Who is it this time?
I can't tell. Hey, where's Lenny?
Wait a minute. You -- you don't think I meant to knock Buzz out the window, do you Potato Head?
That's Mr. Potato Head to you, you back-stabbin' murderer!
That's Mr. Potato Head to you, you back-stabbin' murderer!
Now, it was an accident! Guys, c'mon now, you...you gotta believe me
Good going, Slink! Now, just, just tie it on to something!
Wait! Wait! I got a better idea! How about we DON'T?!
Did you all take stupid pills this morning?! Have you forgotten what he did to Buzz? And now you want to let him back over here?
No, no, no! You got it all wrong, Potato Head. Buzz is fine! Buzz is right here. He's with me!
No, no, no! You got it all wrong, Potato Head. Buzz is fine! Buzz is right here. He's with me!
You are a liar!
You are a liar!
No, I'm not! Buzz, come over here and you just tell the nice toys that you're not dead.
Wait just a minute. What are you trying to pull?!
Nothing.
No! No, no, no, no!
You murdering dog!
You murdering dog!
No, it's not what you think, I swear!
No, it's not what you think, I swear!
Save it for the jury. I hope Sid pulls your voice-box out, ya creep!
No! No! Don't leave! Don't leave! You've gotta help us, please! You don't know what it's like over here!
Come on. Let's get out of here.
No wait! You don't understand! Buzz is out there! We've gotta help him!!
Toss 'im overboard!
Toss 'im overboard!
No, no, no, wait!
ROOAAAARR!!!
Oh, how ya doin', Rex?
Were you scared? Tell me honestly.
I was close to being scared that time.
C'mon, guys! Every Christmas and birthday we go through this.
But what if Andy gets another dinosaur? A mean one? I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection.
But what if Andy gets another dinosaur? A mean one? I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection.
Hey, listen, no one's getting replaced. This is Andy we're talking about.
If I send out the troops, will you all calm down?
Yes! Yes! We promise!
Yes! Yes! We promise!
Okay, save your batteries!
Shouldn't they be there by now? What's taking them so long?!
Hey, these guys are professionals. They're the best. C'mon, they're not lying down on the job.
Ha ha. That's very funny, Buzz. This is serious!!
Hey, Woody!? Where'd ya go?
Hi ya, fellas. To infinity and beyond!
Hey look! It's Buzz!
Hey look! It's Buzz!
Yeah, hey Buzz. Let's show the guys our new secret best-friends hand shake. Gimme five, man!
They're getting bigger.
Wait! There's a nice little one over there!
What the heck is up there?
Woody? Who's up there with you?
It's Sid!
I thought he was at summer camp!
We believe you, Woody. Right, Rex?
Oh, I don't like confrontations.
It's too short! We need more monkeys!
There aren't any more! That's the whole barrel.
I got it, Woody!
He got it, Woody!
Uh, hey Sarge, have you seen Slinky?
Sir! No Sir!
Sir! No Sir!
Okay, thank you. At ease.
Sargent. Establish a recon post downstairs. Code red. You know what to do.
Yes SIR!
Come in, Mother Bird, this is Alpha Bravo.
This is it! This is it! Quiet, quiet, quiet!
This is it! This is it! Quiet, quiet, quiet!
Come in, Mother Bird. Alright...Andy's opening the first present now.
Okay, we're on the last present now...
Last present!
Last present!
It's a big one...It's a...it's a boardgame! Repeat! Battleship -- Battleship, the boardgame!
Mission accomplished. Well done, men. Pack it up, we're going home.
So did I tell ya? Huh? Nothing to worry about.
There.
Juvenile intrusion! Repeat! Resume your positions NOW!
Juvenile intrusion! Repeat! Resume your positions NOW!
Andy's coming, everybody! Back to your places. Hurry!
Buzz. Buzz Lightyear. You are not worried, are you?
I can't quite make out --
Yessss! Ah, ha, ha, ha...
Uh-oh.
Oh, no...it's a Combat Carl.
Just stay where you are, Corporal! Don't move, Carl. You'll blow up. I know you're tired! I know your leg is cramping, but you can't move. Do you hear me?
This is ludicrous.

Not now, Mom, I'm BUSY!
Sid!!!
Reach for the sky!!
Huh?
This town ain't big enough for the two of us!
What?!
Somebody's poisoned the water hole...
It's busted.
W-w-w-we?
That's right. Your toys.
Hey, Slinky?
Right here, Woody!
I'm red this time.
No, Slink --
No, Slink --
Oh...well alright, you can be red if you want.
Oh...well alright, you can be red if you want.
Not now, Slink. I've got some bad news.
Not now, Slink. I've got some bad news.
Bad news?!
Bad news?!
Sh-h-h-h-h!!
Just gather everyone up for a staff meeting and be happy!!
Got it.
Woody, what are you doing under the bed?
Uh-h-h-h...nothing! Uh, nothing. I'm sure Andy was just a little excited, that's all. Too much cake and ice cream, I suppose. It's just a mistake.
Heh, heh, heh! Golly bob howdy --
Oh, shut up! In a couple of days, everything will be just the way it was. They'll see... they'll see. I'm still Andy's favorite toy.
Woody?!
We're gonna get outta here, Buzz -- Buzz?
Boy, am I glad to see you guys!
I knew you'd come back, Woody!
Ha, ha, oh, I love you, too.
See? It is Buzz. Now give back the lights, Potato Head.
Woody! Speed up!
Speed up!
I can't hold on much longer!
Slink! Hang on!
You'll need to know who we are, we're the brothers of his wife, which makes us in an unsanctified kind of way, your uncles. Me name is Finn, me brother is called Francie -
But you're Irish!
But you're Irish!
There's no law, as I know of, to prevent it.
You'll put your clothes here.
There's no mirror.
There's no mirror.
There's not.
I can manage.
Excuse me.
He's a pyjama case, really.

You're spoiling your pretty looks. Come here.
Curled up on the landing like love locked out!
I did like the music.
I did like the music.
I carried you up to your bed.
He can't abide a woman in trousers. He says a woman in trousers is a sin against nature.
A sin against <i>what?</i>
A sin against <i>what?</i>
Slip up and change into a skirt, else he'll create something terrible. Don't you want to make a good impression on your first day?
Is there anything else I should know about him?
Speak when you're spoken to. He likes his women quiet.
I saw his teeth in the bathroom.
He can take out his smile and keep it on a shelf, but, his bite is worse than his bark, isn't that so, old fellow?
Mummy was scared of him, I think. He went to her wedding but he was <i>furious</i>, you can see it in the photograph.
She got away.
He made that. In his off hours.
It's as though he'd trapped a real cuckoo inside.
It's as though he'd trapped a real cuckoo inside.
Didn't you know he made things?
Don't fret. It's only his dream. Dreams aren't catching, not like measles.
I didn't know about the puppets. It's a lot to take in, all at once.
I want to go home.
Home is where the heart is.
Home is where the heart is.
I can't go home because there's no home left.
She's not accustomed to being ignored.
She'll have to learn.
She'll have to learn.
What about school?
What was <i>that</i> in aid of?
Get away from me...
That's your beach. This is the story. Leda walks by the shore, gathering shells. Night comes on. She hears the beating of great wings and sees the approach of the swan. She runs away but it bears down and casts her to the ground. Curtain.
Is that all?
Is that all?
Ah, you should see the swan! His masterpiece. Now, walk along the beach and stoop to pick up the shell.
Finn, there's a splinter in your left foot. If you don't let me take the splinter out, it will fester.
Go away.
Go away.
What did I do wrong?
I won't do it because he wants me to do it, even if I want to do it.
Do what? Oh, I see.
Do what? Oh, I see.
You're only a young thing.
You're only a young thing.
You're not so old yourself!
You're not so old yourself!
Living with him put years on me.
Who's there?
Let me in.
Can I come into bed with you for a little while, I feel terrible.
Well ... yes. All right. But -
Well ... yes. All right. But -
Ah, come on now!
Would you mind holding me in your arms for a little while?
Finn -
Finn -
I'm cold.
You <i>are</i> cold. Where have you been?
I finished it off.
I finished it off.
You did what?
He'll murder you when he finds out.
He'll be looking for another apprentice.
He'll be looking for another apprentice.
I hope he doesn't pick on Jonathon.
I hope he doesn't pick on Jonathon.
Can you move over a wee bit?
The swan was so ridiculous. All the same, it did scare me.
Almighty Jove in the shape of a swan.
Stop it!
I've got a present for you...
I've got a present for you...
Finn ...
Finn ...
In my pocket.
Reprieve.
I know for a fact he didn't take Jonathon. Jonathon went off by himself.
Somebody couldn't wait until dark.
H'm?
H'm?
Nothing ... You shouldn't have given Victoria that Guinness.
Nothing ... You shouldn't have given Victoria that Guinness.
It was only a mouthful!
It was only a mouthful!
Do you think we should take her up to bed?
I thought she was fondest of you, because you were the youngest.
Did you now.
Did you now.
Surely she is older?
Surely she is older?
What difference does <i>that</i> make?
How long has -
All the time.
I already lost everything once.
So did I.
So did I.
But then I had a brother and a sister left.
But then I had a brother and a sister left.
So had I.

Everything is gone, now.
Everything is gone, now.
Nothing is left but us.

Storms?
They're going to fly everywhere. Mean things. They should have taken us.
We're too young.
We're too young.
I'm not too young. Juliet was my age.
I'm not too young. Juliet was my age.
Juliet who?
Juliet who?
In the play. She was married, by my age. And Mummy. Mummy wasn't much older than me when she got married. Well, not <i>that</i> much older.
I'm Melanie.
You're late for breakfast.
Did you do this?
Victoria -
Victoria -
What? Did you let that child play with one of my toys? I don't like children playing with my toys. Have to fix you up with another hammer, won't we. Give her a saucepan to play with, that'll do.
You're well built; how old are you?
Sixteen. Well, nearly sixteen.
Sixteen. Well, nearly sixteen.
I wanted my Leda to be a little girl. Leda and the swan. See?
Oh no you can't. Get on with the painting.
It's all right, Finn.
I appreciate you coming in so early.
Judge Wakefield, it's an honor to handle it for you. Consider it gone away. She's a minor; it probably would've expunged on her 18th birthday anyway.

Still, this was a sensitive issue for me and I wanted to thank you personally.

Like I said, open container, P.I., Misdemeanor possession. Easy to make it disappear. For you, poof, it's gone.
One thing bothers me... That kid they dropped off had coke and heroin in him. Serious amounts. He's lucky he lived. So I gotta ask: what's your daughter on?
I don't know what you mean.
I don't know what you mean.
I mean, did you ask her? What kind of drugs has she tried?
I... I don't really know.
Is she in any kind of therapy... professional help?
Is she in any kind of therapy... professional help?
No, of course not. She's one of the top students at her school.
No, of course not. She's one of the top students at her school.
Well, I hope it stays that way.
Even if that were true, they're not going to come to your house where you're waiting for them.
He's right. They'll do it when you're walking somewhere, make it look like street crime.
Anna. What's wrong? What do you want?
I can't find Manolo.
I can't find Manolo.
He's not here.
He's not here.
He never came home last night. Was he with you?
He never came home last night. Was he with you?
No.
What? What is it?
It's very hard for me to come and tell you this.
Why does he need money?
He has debts. He has gambling debts. He owes a lot of money.

How much?
How much?
Nine thousand dollars.
What is he planning on telling them?
Well, you know, he's going to say about Madrigal... and Salazar.
If Manolo hadn't gone and told them what he did then Salazar and Madrigal would never have been brought to justice. He did a great thing for Tijuana. He did a great thing for Mexico.
I want to believe you. I really do.
I want to believe you. I really do.
You will believe me, because it's true.
Helena, I'm so sorry --
Arnie, thank God.
I understand. You're upset. You want to know what's going on. That's good.
Why are you talking like that?
Why are you talking like that?
Listen to me carefully. First of all, Carl isn't here. DEA's got him and they'll hang on to him until arraignment, which will probably be tomorrow. So here you're wasting your time. Are you with me?
Good. From now on I want you to expect that every word you utter will be tape-recorded, that the movement of your lips is being read. Got it?
Arnie, this is crazy.
Got it? Good. Do not discuss anything over the telephone. Do not talk to the neighbors. Stay out of your yard.
What is he being charged with?
What is he being charged with?
I don't know, but under no circumstances would I talk about it here. I want you to go home and relax the best you can. Continue your life as if nothing has happened. That is very important.

Arnie, I feel like Alice stepping through the looking glass.

That's a very apt analogy, Helena. Now, go home and be with your children.
I am on the board of my son's school. I had a fundraiser for A.L.V. in my front yard. I have a right to know if my husband is a legitimate businessman.
Of course he is. I've known him for twenty years and he doesn't jaywalk...
If all our assets are frozen and our "sales force" has scattered... How am I supposed to survive? I'm giving birth in three months. How do I get through this?
You're gonna get through it, but the first thing we do is get Michael Adler to represent Carl. We get Adler and we beat this thing.

How much do I pay him?
How much do I pay him?
I suspect he'll accept his payment in publicity.
This place is swept twice a day. I learned that in Miami in '85. Then the U.S. shut down the whole Caribbean, but it's a big game of wack-a-mole. Knock it down in Miami, it pops up here. And San Diego is so much more relaxing.
Arnie, I need money. Somebody threatened my children. They want a first payment of three million dollars.

Helena, if I had it I would give it to you, but I don't have that kind of money.
Helena, if I had it I would give it to you, but I don't have that kind of money.
Arnie, help me. Doesn't anyone owe us money?
Arnie, help me. Doesn't anyone owe us money?
Yes, I told you before, there are people who owe you money but they're not paying. There's too much heat on Carl.
Yes, I told you before, there are people who owe you money but they're not paying. There's too much heat on Carl.
Please. Tell me who Carl sells to.
Even if I knew I wouldn't tell you. You do not want to come into contact with these people. Only Carl knows who they are. That's his real asset. Ruiz doesn't know them. They don't know Ruiz. Church and State.

Laundromats for the washing of money. Unfortunately, Carl had only one successful business.
Don't you have some good news? Isn't there something positive you could say.
Sometimes I wonder what I'll do if Carl doesn't get out. I'm not very adept at being on my own. I've always had a man in my life. Always.
I remember when I first met you: little Helen Watts from the wrong side of somewhere. I had a feeling even then that your survival instincts were pretty well honed.

I'm glad you think so, but I'm picturing a debt-ridden, thirty-two year-old mother whose ex-husband is being compared to Pablo Escobar. And I'm wondering who would want to be with someone like that?
That was a stupid thing you did. Incredibly stupid.
I tried, Arnie. And, I will continue to try.
I tried, Arnie. And, I will continue to try.
Have you gone crazy? You are not Carl. You aren't as good as Carl. They are moving the trial to a high security location. The press has gone berserk. The jury will be influenced. Stay out of things. Let us try to win the case.

That is going to be rather difficult when all the evidence is against us.
Helena, please. This is out of your hands.
I know I made things worse. I know that and I'm sorry, but Arnie I need something from you. Something only you can help me with.
Helena --
I need an introduction to the Obregon Brothers.
I need an introduction to the Obregon Brothers.
I can't do that.
Did you get it?
What are you thinking, calling me at home with a message like that? You've compromised me and our relationship --
It's the same stuff? From the rainy day stash?
It's the same. What happened to what they gave you?
It's Saturday, Arnie. You work too hard.
Carl, I'm running late. I'm coming right now --
Don't bother.
What?
What?
So Arnie, when were you going to tell me about the 3 million dollars we got in from San Francisco two days after I got arrested?

So my wife is lying?

Carl, think about it, if I was trying to rip you off, I would have left town after Ruiz was killed. I wouldn't sit next to you in court listening to the dismissal.
Arnie, do think there's a difference between a reason and an excuse, because I don't think there is.
Carl --
Carl --
Goodbye Arnie.
Like a Grateful Dead Concert.
Drugs begin pouring out of America into every other country in the world. Canada is completely overwhelmed.
So you know we put the case before the arbitration panel, none of whom had any expertise. Superfund is just one of those words. People stop paying attention.
That's frustrating.
That's frustrating.
It's so frustrating.
I think she's lying.
Me, too.
Me, too.
We'll ground her, clip her wings a bit. School and scheduled activities and that's it until further notice. This has to be handled delicately. Dan Kelly, in the District Attorney's office, will probably help us out, quietly. Christ, this could be embarrassing.

I think we may have found our Mexican Drug Czar. It's this General, Salazar. At least I'll have somebody on the other side I can talk to.

What's it like? Imagine you're being accosted by a swarm of beggars in the heart of Calcutta, except the beggars are wearing $1500 suits and they don't say "please" or "thank you."
What about legalizing everything? Has anybody talked about that?
What about legalizing everything? Has anybody talked about that?
Fine -- legalization. Okay, forgetting all of our international trade agreements, legalize everything today. The Government inserts itself into all drug transactions. The U.S. becomes a giant pharmacy. Our borders are mobbed, lines of people from here to Europe wanting to smoke, snort and shoot themselves into oblivion.
What if every country legalized at the same time?
Somehow, I don't see that happening.

In Mexico law enforcement is an entrepreneurial activity, this is not so true for the USA.

That's crazy. My husband is on trial for smuggling.
That's crazy. My husband is on trial for smuggling.
Exactly, and this is how I know I'm not getting into business with the U.S. Government.
You will help me with my other problem.
Deliver that safely to Tigrillo in San Diego. And we have a deal.
Wasn't that General Salazar?
Yeah.
Yeah.
What's he doing up here?
What's he doing up here?
I don't know. Something.
Relax. If they were going to kill us they would have done it in the desert.
They wouldn't do it in front of all these people. They'd send someone later, when we're alone.
If you want her to stay out of it, then stop telling her everything. You should learn how to keep a secret.
She's nosy. She hears me on the telephone.
She's nosy. She hears me on the telephone.
Anyway, I don't think we'll ever see them again. Everything's back to normal.
Please. Filing a report will not help you find your car.
The police won't find your car.
This is fucking crazy. Instead of killing us, he sends us on a suicide mission. Do you know who Frankie Flowers is? He's a psycho-cokehead- hitman. A faggot. He's killed fucking who knows how many people. You'd need half the force to get close to him. And you can't get their help because he lives in fucking San Diego.
Then I guess I'm going by myself.
A group of us are going out tonight.
Who?
Who?
Guzman, Tomas, Esteban --
Guzman, Tomas, Esteban --
Your new friends.
Your new friends.
Yeah. It should be fun. You wanna come?
Yeah. It should be fun. You wanna come?
Not this time.
It's no problem. I was just with everybody we work with.
Oh, really. General Salazar was there?
Oh, really. General Salazar was there?
No, but a lot of other people. You should come. You should come out with us.
No, but a lot of other people. You should come. You should come out with us.
Go home. Get cleaned up. Get to work. Salazar is heading down to Mexico City next week and I'm not getting left behind. Don't fuck this up.
Madrigal's alive.
What?
What?
Porfirio Madrigal is not dead. I just saw him.
Javi! Come on. Don't pull this you don't care bullshit. This is incredible information. It must be. Javi --
We keep our mouths shut.
Somewhere safe.
Where?
Where?
A place we have, that we know is protected.
A place we have, that we know is protected.
No.
It's important that we work together. Mexico. America. One hand washing the other.
We agree.
We agree.
So... maybe you tell me about your informants in our operations.
So... maybe you tell me about your informants in our operations.
We thought maybe you'd have that kind of information for us.
We thought maybe you'd have that kind of information for us.
This is a very different proposition.
You should feel good about this.
I feel like a traitor.
What's your name?
Javier Rodriguez.
Javier Rodriguez.
Well, Javier Rodriguez, you've done a very good job, but we'll take care of it from here.
One question. How did you find about this?
An informant.
An informant.
What is the name of your informant?
What is the name of your informant?
It was an anonymous tip.
That's your past. I want to talk about your future. Would you be willing to do something for me?
If I can.
If I can.
I'm trying to bust the Tijuana Cartel.

What is it you want me to do?
What is it you want me to do?
A small thing. Nothing really.
Does this offer include my partner?
Only if he can be trusted.
