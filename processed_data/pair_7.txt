Beautiful! I've never seen that coat.
Seven jaguars' skins, I'm told. Harold shot every one. Shall we go?
What then?
We could have had some kind of birthday party for him. We could have taken Paul to the fight with us.
Did you see him?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Is he all right?

Far as I know.

How nice.
How nice.
They had this cake somebody else hadn't picked up. It says, "Happy Birthday, Somebody Else."
Did you talk to Paul?
Before he started to run. He said his father carried a key to this apartment around his neck--and someday we'd all hear the sound of that key in the door.

We've got to find him. I want you to show me exactly where you saw him last. And you stay here, Norbert, in case he comes home. That's all he said--the thing about the key?

He told me to take a flying fuck at the moon.

We got a birthday cake, kid. Did you see the cake?
Possibly.
How long has this been going on?

Thank you, Herb. You're a wonderful man. You really are. Everybody respects you for what you've done for scouting and the Little League.

You were wonderful.

What's so wonderful if I lost the sale? You poor kid.
It's true.
Well--it was nice while it lasted. Thanks for the memories.
You and Harold are friends?
He's the most wonderful guy I ever met, Penelope. He's the most complicated guy I ever met. I can't believe it, but he's going to take me to Africa with him.
I am Dr. Norbert Woodly--a physician, a healer. I find it disgusting and frightening that a killer should be a respected member of society. Gentleness must replace violence everywhere, or we are doomed.
Would you like to say something about killing, Colonel?
Herb Shuttle is taking me to a fight.
Take plenty of cigars.

She quit this afternoon.
The animals made her sneeze and cry too much.
I'm glad somebody finally cried. Every time I come in here and see all this unnecessary death, I want to cry. I don't cry, of course. Not manly, you know. Did she try antihistamines?

Throw out all this junk. Burn it! This room crawls with tropical disease.
"War is not healthy for children and other living things." How lovely.
No doubt Paul thinks it stinks.
Oh no! Wear a coat of cotton--wear a coat of wool.
What?
What?
Wear a coat of domestic mink. For the love of God, though, Penelope, don't lightheartedly advertise that the last of the jaguars died for you.
I never knew when to hold it--or who to ask, or what to say.
Tonight's the night.
This is very good for us.
It is?

The wilder Paul is tonight, the calmer he'll be tomorrow.

No. But he's going to be. If he is in the park and he comes out safely on the other side, I can say to him, "You and I are the only men with balls enough to walk through the park at midnight." On that we can build.

Tell her to have a nice trip.

Thanks.
Get out of here.
It's really that bad?
You fool, you fool.
Oh--look at the poor, crucified violin, would you?
Everything's going to be beautiful.
You fake! You're no better than the dumbest general in the Pentagon. You're not going to beat Harold. You're not going to beat anybody. You're not going to stay here, either--yammering and taunting until you're most gloriously killed. Go home!
Do it!
Goodbye.
Hi kid. Would you look what the car dragged in.
I'm glad you brought your vacuum cleaner.

You can believe that if you want. I talk to guys like you, and I want to commit suicide. You get that weight-lifting set I sent you?
Start with the smallest weights. Every week add a pound or two.
Maybe God has let everybody who ever lived be reborn--so he or she can see how it ends. Even Pithecanthropus erectus and Australopithecus and Sinanthropus pekensis and the Neanderthalers are back on Earth--to see how it ends. They're all on Times Square--making change for peepshows. Or recruiting Marines.

Minors aren't allowed at fights.
Then we'd stay home and eat venison or something, and look through the scrapbooks. I've got a friend who has a whole freezer full of striped bass and caribou meat. I'm going to bring that boy back.

It was almost worth the trip--to find out that Jesus Christ in Heaven was just another guy, playing shuffleboard. I like his sense of humor, though--you know? He's got a blue-and-gold warm-up jacket he wears. You know what it says on the back? "Pontius Pilate Athletic Club." Most people don't get it.

Well, actually I wanted to ask about this girl. I have her picture here.
Pull out your cock.
Pull out your cock.
What?
What?
Cops aren't allowed to do that either. A judge ruled that that was entrapment. Don't ask me why. I guess he figured the sight of a Vice Officer's dong would make a girl unable to stop herself.
No, Felice, I'm not a cop. In fact, right now I've got as little respect for the police as you do. I'm looking for a girl. A runaway. I need someone to help me.

How much do you make a week, Niki?
Are you a private detective?
Something like that. How much do you make?

Here? What a joke. There was some detective asking about that girl.

This is different. This is nine hundred dollars.
I thought you were going to bed?
I am.
No.
Huh?
Huh?
Niki. Calm down. Relax. Let's just talk for a while. Then, later, you'll go back to your room and we'll get some sleep.
You have anything to drink? You want to go out and get something?
I don't drink, but you can go out.
I don't drink, but you can go out.
You don't drink?
You don't drink?
Ulcers.
You're not a private detective either, are you?
No.
No.
I didn't think so. I've fucked detectives. Who are you?
I didn't think so. I've fucked detectives. Who are you?
A friend.

Of Joanne's?

Yeah. I'm her father.

She's dead.
She's dead.
Hey, don't worry about it. Your daughter's around. We'll find her in a couple days.
You really shouldn't eat like that. All that sugar. It's not good for you.
At least I'm a growing person.

You won't keep growing at this rate.

You never met a working girl before, have you? You think I like sucking off guys all night? Maybe I do. So what? You can't even say it, can you?
You never met a working girl before, have you? You think I like sucking off guys all night? Maybe I do. So what? You can't even say it, can you?
Say what?
Say what?
'Sucking off.'
'Sucking off.'
Okay. Sucking off. Now does that make me as good as you?

You don't understand shit.
You don't understand shit.
Okay, tell me. Why do you live like you do?
Okay, tell me. Why do you live like you do?
Did you ever live in a room with six people and you didn't have any money, any food, any furniture? Have your brother come out, his car break down, he can't get a job? Your friends stealing food, going through trash behind a supermarket?

Is that the way it was with you?
Is that the way it was with you?
No. But does it make any difference? How did you get to be the way you are?
Don't knock it. A girl can save up a lot money doing this -- big money. Then you're free. You can go off to Europe, meet somebody, get married. My girlfriend's going to buy her own beauty parlor. Not me. I'm gonna travel. 'Keep movin' that's my motto. Would you rather work at Copper Penny at a dollar-eighty an hour, having every two-bit cocksucker
You used to work at Copper Penny?

No.
No.
You and I, Niki, have very different ideas about sex.

Neither am I.

But it's all you do.

How important do you think sex is?
How important do you think sex is?
Not very.
Not very.
We're just alike. You think sex is so unimportant you don't do it. I think sex is so unimportant I don't care who I do it with.
I don't see why I must justify myself to you. I don't care about the things you do. I don't care what's happening in New York or Los Angeles. I don't care about movies or TV. I don't care who's on Johnny Carson.
What do you care about?
What do you care about?
I care about my daughter.
What's T-J?
Tijuana.
Tijuana.
They were here?

Tod was. He was with Ratan.

What does that mean? What does he do?

He deals in pain.

Is Kristen safe?
You have to believe in something. What do they believe in -- the Whatjamacillit church?
Christian Reformed. It's a Dutch Calvinist denomination.
Christian Reformed. It's a Dutch Calvinist denomination.
Do they believe in reincarnation? I believe in reincarnation.
Do they believe in reincarnation? I believe in reincarnation.
They believe in the 'TULIP.'
They believe in the 'TULIP.'
What the crap?
What the crap?
It's an anagram. It comes from the Canons of Dort. Every letter stands for a different belief. T-U-L-I-P. Like -- are you sure you're interested in this?

Yeah, yeah, go on.
Yeah, yeah, go on.
T stands for Total depravity, that is, all men, through original sin, are totally evil and incapable of good. 'All my works are like filthy rags in the sight of the Lord.'
T stands for Total depravity, that is, all men, through original sin, are totally evil and incapable of good. 'All my works are like filthy rags in the sight of the Lord.'
Shit.
Be that as it may. U is for Unconditional Election. God has chosen a certain number of people to be saved, The Elect, and He has chosen them from the beginning of time. L is for Limited Atonement. Only a limited number will be atoned, will go to Heaven.
Fuck.
Fuck.
I can stop if you want.
I can stop if you want.
No, please go on.
I is for Irresistible Grace. God's grace cannot be resisted or denied. And P is for the Perseverance of the Saints. Once you are in Grace you cannot fall from the number of the elect. And that's the 'TULIP.'
Wait, wait. I'm trying to figure this out. This is like Rona Barrett. Before you become saved, God already knows who you are?
Wait, wait. I'm trying to figure this out. This is like Rona Barrett. Before you become saved, God already knows who you are?
He has to. That's Predestination. If God is omniscient, if He knows everything -- and He wouldn't be God if He didn't -- then He must have known, even before the creation of the world, the names of those who would be saved.

So it's already worked out. The fix is in?
So it's already worked out. The fix is in?
More or less.
More or less.
Wow. Then why be good? Either you're saved or you ain't.
Wow. Then why be good? Either you're saved or you ain't.
Out of gratitude for being chosen. That's where Grace comes in. God first chooses you, then allows you, by Grace, to choose Him of your own free will.

I thought I was fucked up.

I'll admit it's confusing from the outside. You've got to see it from the inside.
I'll admit it's confusing from the outside. You've got to see it from the inside.
If you see anything from the inside it makes sense. You ought to hear perverts talk. A guy once almost had me convinced to let his dachshund fuck me.

Tod'll meet you at the bookstore at Eddy and O'Farrell tomorrow noon. I told him you were a 'specialty' customer.
Why can't I meet him now?
Rot in hell, honey. He's busy now.
Where does he live.
Where does he live.
Just a second. It's my ass I'm risking. You better do it my way. These fuckers don't mess around.
I must have been in more motel rooms this week than in the rest of my life. At least it feels that way.
I know what you mean. After a while they all look the same.

Do you live in a house back in wherever.

Grand Rapids? Of course.

On your own land?
Look, I really don't know your daughter but...
But what?
But what?
I wouldn't expect too much. I mean about her coming back. Once a girl gets into the life.
I wouldn't expect too much. I mean about her coming back. Once a girl gets into the life.
What makes you so sure?
What makes you so sure?
You wife isn't dead is she?
Why do you say that?
Just a guess. She ain't dead though is she?
She left you right?
Yeah. She was the one called Joanne. How'd you find that out?
Yeah. She was the one called Joanne. How'd you find that out?
Just a guess. Did you have it good with your wife? You know, sex.
I don't blame you, Niki. Really I don't. It's this culture, where everything's based on sex, sold on sex... ...magazines, music, TV. It's destroying everything. Buy this 'cause of sex, use this 'cause of sex. Kids think it's normal. They think they're supposed to talk dirty, wear scanty clothes...
Don't get upset. I lied too. I don't make no five hundred dollars a week. Everything I make goes to Granville.
Don't get upset. I lied too. I don't make no five hundred dollars a week. Everything I make goes to Granville.
Granville?
Granville?
My man. 'Pimp.' I split 'cause he don't treat me for shit. Thinks he's so cool 'cause he's black. I once tried to take my clothes but he says, 'You can't take 'em 'cause they're my clothes -- I bought 'em.' Yeah, with my fucking money...
Look, Niki, this really isn't my business. I don't know anything about...
So I guess we're both fucked, huh? But at least you get to go to heaven. I don't get shit.
Did you find out where she was?
Tod gave me the slip. I have to find him again. Where does he live?
Tod gave me the slip. I have to find him again. Where does he live?
What happened?
What happened?
Where is he?
Where is he?
I can't tell you that.
Listen, Niki. My daughter's been missing five months. I've gone through a lot to find out what's happened to her. I just saw a girl killed. I will not let Tod slip out of my hands. You have to tell me where he is.
But then you'll forget about me.
But then you'll forget about me.
Where is he, Niki?
Those cops, like all cops, are intelligent enough, but they are masters of de-ductive reason. That is, you ask them what three and two are they'll tell you five, but if you ask them what five is, they go blank. That's spec-u-lative reasoning, and that's where I come in.
Well, what do they know?
Well, what do they know?
Dogshit. Worse yet, they don't care.
Dogshit. Worse yet, they don't care.
So then, Mr. Mast...
So then, Mr. Mast...
Andy.
Andy.
...What do you have to offer?
...What do you have to offer?
Let me ask you a personal question, a painful one. The first of many. Tell me, was your daughter the kind of girl to run around, to, ah, play practical jokes, maybe?
No, I didn't think she was. Let me get the picture here. Let me guess. She was an absolutely clean girl, a model daughter, she never had rebellious or impure thoughts, she didn't fuck around...
If I was you, Mr. Mast, I'd watch my language.
If I was you, Mr. Mast, I'd watch my language.
Hey, I'm a private detective, Van Dorn, you want to hire a choir boy you can go back to Grand Rapids. I've been to that scumbag town. It's full of them.

Who's paying you?
Who's paying you?
You are.
You are.
That's right.
That's right.
As I was saying, I'll pick up the thread. There's a number of ways I can go. There's not much you can do here. Stay if you want. Maybe it'd be better if you went back home. Go through Kristen's personal stuff. Ask around, maybe she knew somebody out here. Look, I do this a lot. I work at a minimum rate of $750.00

And better?
I suppose. But I'll tell you, Jake, I'm like a little animal. When I get my teeth into something I never let go. If your daughter's here, I'll track her down.
Hello?
Mr. Van Dorn?
Mr. Van Dorn?
Mast?
Mast?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Where are you? The connection sounds very good.

What are you paying me for?
What are you paying me for?
I'll be there.
This used to be a real city. I was here about fifteen years ago. Embezzlement case. It was always a little religious for my taste, but at least it was a city. With a downtown and all.
What have you found out?
What have you found out?
I've got some news. Your daughter's all right. At least I think she is.

They're legal now.

They are?

Yeah. All over. Even here in Grand Rapids.
Yeah. All over. Even here in Grand Rapids.
Hmm.
Hmm.
There's a little stall theatre up here. It's closed now, but I'm borrowing it for an hour. I think there's something you'd better see.
Where is she?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Where did you get that film?
I bought it at a store in L.A.
Who made it?
Who made it?
I don't know.
I don't know.
What do you mean?
Wait. Slow down. A film like this, 16mm, cost two three hundred dollars, sold outright, shown in peep machines, maybe theatres, maybe not, is almost impossible to track. 'Nobody' makes it; 'nobody' shows it; 'nobody' sees it. It's like it doesn't even exist.
What's it called?
What's it called?
It was called 'Slave of Love' when I bought it. Next time it's sold, it'll be called something else.

Do you think she's safe?
Do you think she's safe?
Yeah. Probably.
Yeah. Probably.
You like this, don't you. Showing me... this.
You like this, don't you. Showing me... this.
I hate it. But you gotta know, buddy. A lot of strange things happen in this world. Things you don't know about in Grand Rapids. Things you don't want to know about. Doors that should never be opened. I've known more about this sort of thing than a man should. Don't ask me why.
I ain't cheated you, Pilgrim. This is research, damn it! That girl could have told us something.
Research, my ass. I suppose these are the 'extra expenses' I've been paying for? And in the middle of the morning, too.
Oh, fuck off. You should stay where you belong.
Get out. Get out of here, Goddammit.
I'm only human, you know.
Get out.
Get out.
But this is my apartment.
But this is my apartment.
Get out!
What are you doing here?
I felt like such a shit, pilgrim, after what I did to you -- not that I did anything wrong -- that I kept investigating, poking around. There's some poor s.o.b. in L.A. with his face all bent out of shape who you've damaged his movie career. Lucky for him, people don't look at his face.

Do the police want to arrest me?
Do the police want to arrest me?
Nah. They don't care about some faggot hustler. They're more interested in your daughter's health -- and yours. Like I am.
Nah. They don't care about some faggot hustler. They're more interested in your daughter's health -- and yours. Like I am.
Yeah, sure.
Yeah, sure.
Listen, pilgrim, you're way out on a limb here. You don't know what you're into.
Listen, pilgrim, you're way out on a limb here. You don't know what you're into.
You sure as hell haven't been any help.

I'm sorry about that. Have you found anything out? You've got to tell me.

Like what?
Like what?
Who is Ratan?
Where'd you hear that name?
I just heard. Who is he?
You know, it's possible to buy anything on this earth. You can buy child whores, slaves. You can have people raped, killed... One of the men who supposedly arranges such things is named Ratan. He usually isn't in this country. How'd you hear about him?
It's just a name.
It's just a name.
Don't do anything more. I'll find out what I can.
Don't do anything more. I'll find out what I can.
Does she know anything about this?
Does she know anything about this?
Who? The whore? No. She's just a victim. A dime a dozen.
What happened, pilgrim?
Just leave me alone.
Just leave me alone.
But I'm here to help you...
Andy, can you do something for her? Maybe money...
Go home, pilgrim. There's nothing you can do. Forget this place. Start over.
You want to go for coffee after we send the girls off?
No. Thanks anyway. I've got to get over to the office.
No. Thanks anyway. I've got to get over to the office.
Anne wants to make sure you come over for dinner Sunday. With Kristen gone you'll be all alone.
What is it, Jake?
Wes, Anne, come here a moment.
What happened?
They don't know. They were having some recreation deal out at Knott's Berry Farm and Kristen wasn't there when they got back to the bus and they couldn't find her.
Is Marsha there?
Yeah. She's quite upset. I'm going to fly out today. They want me to bring some pictures.
Yeah. She's quite upset. I'm going to fly out today. They want me to bring some pictures.
I'll come with you. Let me pack some things.
How's your business, Jake?
Pretty good.
Pretty good.
You should come around more often. You haven't been around for weeks. Anne complains she doesn't see you anymore.
Jake?
How did you find me?
How did you find me?
I called every L.A. hotel. The Holiday Inn gave this as a referral number. Your office said you had no business in New York, so I figured you had come out here. What's happening, Jake? What are you doing? Nobody's heard from you. Anne's worried sick. We didn't know if you were dead or alive.
Wes, do me a favor.
What?
What?
Leave me alone. Go home. Go away.
Just do what I say. Don't ask.
What is going on?
What is going on?
I think I've found a way to find Kristen. I have a plan. But I have to be alone.

You don't want to know. Now, Wes, leave, please. For me.

Oh yeah? I've done a lot of good stuff. Shorts, features. No major roles it's true. But good stuff.
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
Oh yeah? I remember that. It was made by some college kids.
It was called 'Slave of Love.'

I thought you were quite good in it. I also like the girl in it. Really thought she was good. I wondered if she was still around. If she was still working.
Hey, stop, stop. I'll do anything you want. It's okay. I can dig it. You can do anything you want to me.
Where is she? Where is the girl?

Who the fuck knows? The Four Aces. He goes there.
Let's go.

This is from the movie I was talking about.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I wondered if you had ever seen this film or this woman... ...right here.

But I...
But I...
I don't know nothing, man.
You don't want anything for your fifty cents?
No.
Here. Take your fifty cents back.
That's all right.
That's all right.
No, take it. I don't want your Goddamn fifty cents.
No. I walked up. Don't ride elevators.
My secretary said you wanted to discuss a business proposition.
My secretary said you wanted to discuss a business proposition.
Yes. I'm interested in financing an adult feature film. I was told you were the man to come to.
Yes. I'm interested in financing an adult feature film. I was told you were the man to come to.
Film making can be pretty expensive...
I've got fifty thousand dollars to invest.
Oh. Why is it that you want to get into film financing?
Oh. Why is it that you want to get into film financing?
Well, Bill -- mind if I call you Bill? Let me be frank. I've made a lot of money. I've got my own business in Detroit. Rivets. I make rivets and sell them to Fisher Body. Well, rivets, you know, can get pretty boring after a while. When my business manager told me I should shelter some money, I thought I'd try this.

In other words, you want to get laid?

It's cool. Why do you think I got in the movies? How much poon do you think you get in the car wash business? Look, fifty thousand dollars buys a lot of pussy. You can get your joint pulled by beautiful girls every night for the rest of your life for fifty thousand dollars. So why fuck with the movie business?

If you want to watch when we shoot a film, for fifty bucks, I let guys stand around and watch. It's a lot cheaper.

Don't get me wrong. A couple years ago, I woulda jumped at fifty thousand dollars possible financing. But the Lord's been good to me. I can now finance any films I choose. Big ones, small ones. Right now we're setting up a two hundred thousand dollar feature film. Live sound. I like to keep my own money in my films. That way you don't

Jake.
Jake.
...I'd just start my own business. That's what I did. Get into kid porn. That's big now. Why don't you come around the set? Meet some people. If you still want to invest, I'll ask around.

Sounds all right.
Sounds all right.
Okay. Keep in touch with my secretary.
I got a picture here. I want you to tell me where to find this woman. I been asking everybody. Nobody knows anything.
Calm down, mister. You don't want to get the cops in here do you? You got a family?
Calm down, mister. You don't want to get the cops in here do you? You got a family?
I don't suppose you've ever seen this girl before either? Her name's Kristen, but I suppose you've never seen her?

Why don't you just go outdoors, mister? Cool off.
Why don't you just go outdoors, mister? Cool off.
Cool off, huh? How's this for cooling off?
Hold it, mister.
What do you think of that? Or this?
You going to Knott's Berry Farm with him?
He asked me. You going with anybody?

I don't know.

Com'on, tell me.
Com'on, tell me.
Well, a boy goes like this, see.
What does that do?
Well, each time he comes in closer, like this.
Ssh. I'm on a stakeout.
Oh.
I'm staking out this beer bottle. Trying to find out if I'll finish it or it'll finish me.
I'm worried about Jake.
I'm worried about Jake.
I'm off that case. He fired me.
I'm off that case. He fired me.
He didn't look good at all. Something strange is going on. He's got himself into some trouble. He wouldn't say what.
He didn't look good at all. Something strange is going on. He's got himself into some trouble. He wouldn't say what.
I'll tell you, that was an interesting case. The Van Dorn girl. I've handled runaway cases like it before. Usually when you put the pressure on the porn underworld for an underage kid, she pops up in about a week. Everybody denies ever seeing her, but there she is at the airport with a prepaid ticket home. Well, I put pressure on all over
I want to rehire you. To find out what's happening to my brother-in- law.
I've been on another case. All day. I suppose I can move it over. Seven fifty a week, plus travel expenses.

Do you really think Kristen is just a runaway?
Maybe. Maybe not.
I also want you to protect my brother- in-law.
I also want you to protect my brother- in-law.
Huh?
Huh?
You have to understand. He can be mean, self-righteous. He had a Vishund once. Loved that dog. He came home one day and the dog bit him. He took that dog and staked him out in the back yard. It was winter. Every day he came home and watched that dog until he froze. He's capable of doing anything.

I ain't ever gonna see him again anyway.
I ain't ever gonna see him again anyway.
Oh no? What you gonna do? Get a job?
Jake'll take care of me.
Who? Van Dorn? You must be kidding yourself, honey. You think once that guy finds his daughter he'll care about you?
Hey, piss-head, what brings you around?
You don't have to get uppity with me, Bill. I remember when you was running that car wash and couldn't make it go. And what was that other thing you tried? A Dairy Queen? Went busted too.
You don't have to get uppity with me, Bill. I remember when you was running that car wash and couldn't make it go. And what was that other thing you tried? A Dairy Queen? Went busted too.
At least I improved myself. What's up?
I want you to take a look at this girl here. She's been in some porn stuff.
No, Andy. Don't know the kid.
No, Andy. Don't know the kid.
Look again, Billy-boy. This is jail bait. Could get you in a lotta trouble.
Look again, Billy-boy. This is jail bait. Could get you in a lotta trouble.
Nope never saw her before. Kurt, come over here. Don't use underage kids. Wouldn't touch 'em for all the cow shit in Mexico. You recognize this piece of wool, Kurt?
You remember me. Louise? Rhymes with squeeze.
You working in San Diego now?

I'm still in L.A., but I'm looking for Tod. I heard he was around.
I'm still in L.A., but I'm looking for Tod. I heard he was around.

Hello, I'm Candy Gulf.
How do you do. I'm Mrs. Chasen. Come in.
You are at the University, Candy?
Yes, I am.
Yes, I am.
And what are you studying?

Poli. Sci. With a home ec minor.

Eh, Poli Sci?
Eh, Poli Sci?
Political Science. It's all about what's going on.
He seems very nice. Is Harold interested in, eh, what's going on? I think it's such a super thing to study. And then, of course, I can always fall back on home ec.
Yes, that's good planning. Tell me, are you a regular, Candy, in this computer club?
I think I should mention, Candy, that Harold does have his eccentric moments.
Oh, <u>yes</u>? Well, that's all right. I've got a brother who's a real cut-up, too. I'll never forget the time we had this old TV set with no parts in it. Well, Tommy stuck his head behind it and started giving a newscast before the whole family. We were all hysterical. And here's little Tommy pretending to be Walter Cronkite.
Lady, you were going 70 miles an hour in a 45-mile zone. Could I see your license, please?
Yes. Those little pieces of paper with your picture on it?
Yes. Those little pieces of paper with your picture on it?
Yes.
Yes.
Oh, I don't have one.

I don't have one. I don't believe in them.
I don't have one. I don't believe in them.
How long have you been driving?
How long have you been driving?
About forty-five minutes, wouldn't you say, Harold? We were hoping to start sooner but, you see, it's rather hard to find a truck.

Could I see your registration?

I just don't think we have one, unless it's in the glove compartment. Could you look, Harold?

Isn't this your vehicle?

No, no. I just took it.

Took it?
Took it?
Yes. You see I have to plant my tree.
Yes. You see I have to plant my tree.
Your tree.
Your tree.
Well, it's not really mine. I dug it up in front of the courthouse. We're transplanting it. Letting it breathe, you know. But, of course, we would like to get it into soil, as soon as possible.

All right, then, and we'll be off. Nice chatting with you.
Okay, lady. Out.
Hello.
Haven't we met before?
None of that, lady.
None of that, lady.
Oh, well. Must have been your brother.
Oh, well. Must have been your brother.
Out!
But there is a family resemblance.
You too, Buster. Stand over here. Lady, you're in a heap of trouble. I have you down here for several violations; speeding, resisting arrest, driving without a license, driving a stolen vehicle, possession of a stolen tree... Where's the tree?

Lady, is it true you're driving without a license?

Check.
Check.
And that truck - is it registered in your name?

Oh no! Not in <u>my</u> name.

Because if you are...
Because if you are...
Lady! Be quiet.
This way, Edith. Harold is out by the garage. He has a new car and he has been tuning it up. He's very mechanical.
What kind of a car is it?
Oh. It looks like a hearse. Very nice. Compact.
Edith, I'd like you to meet my son, Harold. Harold, this is Edith... eh?
Edith, I'd like you to meet my son, Harold. Harold, this is Edith... eh?
Fern. I'm very pleased to make your acquaintance.
And what do you do, my dear?
I'm a file clerk - Harrison Feed and Grain.
I'm a file clerk - Harrison Feed and Grain.
How interesting.
How interesting.
Not very.
Not very.
Oh. Well, what is it exactly that you do?
Oh. Well, what is it exactly that you do?
I'm in charge of all the invoices for the southwest. We supply, for example, most of the egg farmers in Southern California. So you can imagine.
Edith was just telling me about her job.
I'm a file clerk.
I'm a file clerk.
Yes. Henderson Feed and Grain.
Yes. Henderson Feed and Grain.

Well, not all the southwest. Although we do have a large business... Barley was very big last week... Fifteen hundred...
What do you want?
I'm sorry. I was looking for Maude.
Sorry I'm late.
A rather free translation but nonetheless correct. Greetings to you too, my little one. Tell me, what do you see?
A rather free translation but nonetheless correct. Greetings to you too, my little one. Tell me, what do you see?
A block of ice.
A block of ice.
Exactly! Now, ask me what I see.
Exactly! Now, ask me what I see.
What do you see?
What do you see?
I see the eternal goddess of beauty and love. I see Aphrodite. The consummate woman.
Here's your shovel.
What?... Oh yes... Shovel... Create ... Verily these issues lie in the lap of the gods... Iliad... Just sit down for a minute.
Eh, no. Thank you.
You're welcome. Did you know him?
You're welcome. Did you know him?
Eh, no.
Eh, no.
Me neither. I heard he was eighty years old. I'll be eighty next week. A good time to move on, don't you think?
Me neither. I heard he was eighty years old. I'll be eighty next week. A good time to move on, don't you think?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I mean, seventy-five is too early, but at eighty-five, well, you're just marking time and you may as well look over the horizon.
It's a question of emphasis, you might say. Accentuate the positive, so to speak.
Eh, could I have my pen back now, please?
Eh, could I have my pen back now, please?
Oh, of course. What is your name?
Oh, of course. What is your name?
Harold Chasen.
Harold Chasen.
How do you do? I am Dame Marjorie Chardin, but you may call me Maude.
How do you do? I am Dame Marjorie Chardin, but you may call me Maude.
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
Oh, thank you. I think we shall be great friends, don't you?
Can I drop you anywhere, Harold?
No, thank you. I have my car.
No, thank you. I have my car.
Well then, I must be off. We shall have to meet again.
Do you dance?
What?
What?
Do you sing and dance?
Do you sing and dance?
Eh, no.
Eh, no.
No. I thought not.
Yes.
Oh, so do I. They're such fun, aren't they? It's all change. All revolving. Burials and births. The end to the beginning and the beginning to the end - - the great circle of life. My, this old thing handles well. Ever drive a hearse, Harold?
Oh, so do I. They're such fun, aren't they? It's all change. All revolving. Burials and births. The end to the beginning and the beginning to the end - - the great circle of life. My, this old thing handles well. Ever drive a hearse, Harold?
Yes.
Yes.
Well, it's a new experience for me. Good on curves. Shall I take you home, Harold?
Well, it's a new experience for me. Good on curves. Shall I take you home, Harold?
But this is my car.
But this is my car.
Your hearse?
Your hearse?
Yearse!
Yearse!
Oh.
Of course, I've had to make some additions for the new models, but not as many as you might think. Once you have your basic set it's then only a question of variation.
And you get into any car you want and just drive off?
And you get into any car you want and just drive off?
Not <u>any</u> car. I like to keep a variety. I'm always looking for the new experience, like this one. I liked it.
Not <u>any</u> car. I like to keep a variety. I'm always looking for the new experience, like this one. I liked it.
Thank you. But when you take these cars don't you think you are wronging the owners?
Thank you. But when you take these cars don't you think you are wronging the owners?
What owners, Harold? We don't <u>own</u> anything. It's a transitory world. We come on the earth with nothing, and we go out with nothing, so isn't "ownership" a little absurd?
What owners, Harold? We don't <u>own</u> anything. It's a transitory world. We come on the earth with nothing, and we go out with nothing, so isn't "ownership" a little absurd?
Still, I think you'd upset people and I'm not sure that's right.
Still, I think you'd upset people and I'm not sure that's right.
Well, if some people are upset because they feel they have a hold on some things, then I'm merely acting as a gentle reminder - I'm sort of breaking it easy -- Here today, gone tomorrow, so don't get attached to <u>things</u>. Now, with that in mind, I'm not against collecting stuff...
It's all memorabilia, but incidental and not integral, if you know what I mean.
It's very interesting.
It's very interesting.
Oh, look! The birds.
She's very sweet, but so old- fashioned. Please sit down, Harold. I'll put on the kettle and we'll have a nice hot cup of tea.
Thank you, but I really have to go.
Thank you, but I really have to go.
But it's oat straw tea. You've never had oat straw tea, have you?
But it's oat straw tea. You've never had oat straw tea, have you?
No.
No.
Well then.
Thank you, but it's an appointment. I really shouldn't miss it.
Oh, at the dentist's?
Oh, at the dentist's?
Sort of.
Sort of.
Well, then, you must come back and visit.
Well, then, you must come back and visit.
All right.
All right.
My door is always open.
My door is always open.
All right.
All right.
Promise?
Harold?
Maude???!
How about some ginger pie?
Eh, fine.
Eh, fine.
I'll heat some up. My, it's nice to see you again, Harold. How's your hearse?
I'll heat some up. My, it's nice to see you again, Harold. How's your hearse?
Oh, it's fine. Fine.
Oh, it's fine. Fine.
She seemed yare to me.
Do you often model for Glaucus?
Heavens no! I don't have the time. But I like to keep in practice and poor Glaucus occasionally needs his memory refreshed as to the contours of the female form. Do you disapprove?
Heavens no! I don't have the time. But I like to keep in practice and poor Glaucus occasionally needs his memory refreshed as to the contours of the female form. Do you disapprove?
Me! No. Of course not.
Me! No. Of course not.
Really. Do you think it's wrong?
Really. Do you think it's wrong?
No.
No.
Oh, I'm so happy you said that because I wanted to show you my paintings. This is the "Rape of Rome" and, of course, there in the corner is quite a graphic depiction of Leda and the Swan.
A self-portrait. But over here is my favorite. It's titled "Rainbow with Egg Underneath and an Elephant." Do you like it?
Yes. Very much.
Yes. Very much.
It was my last. I then became infatuated with these -- my "Odorifics."
Now I'll pump it up... ... and you just turn the handles. Okay. What do you smell?
Subways... Perfume... Cigarette... ... Cologne... Carpet... Chestnuts! ... <u>Snow!</u>
Subways... Perfume... Cigarette... ... Cologne... Carpet... Chestnuts! ... <u>Snow!</u>
It goes on and on.
It goes on and on.
That's really great.
What do you think?
Oh. Eh, I like it.
Oh. Eh, I like it.
No, you have to touch it. You have to run your hands over it, get close to it, really reach out and feel. You try it.
Here we are, Harold. Oat straw tea and ginger pie.
Certainly a new experience for me.
Certainly a new experience for me.
Wonderful! Try something new each day. After all, we're given life to find it out. It doesn't last forever.
You look as if you could.
Me. Ha! Did I tell you I'll be eighty on Saturday?
Me. Ha! Did I tell you I'll be eighty on Saturday?
You don't look eighty.
You don't look eighty.
That's the influence of the right food, the right exercise, and the right breathing. Greet the dawn with the Breath of Fire! Of course, there's no doubt the body is giving out. I'm well into autumn. I'll have to be giving it all up after Saturday. Sweeten the tea with honey, Harold. It's delicious.

That's a nice teapot.
That's a nice teapot.
Sterling silver. It was my dear mother-in-law's, part of a dinner set of fifty pieces. It's one of the few things that survived. Oh, but I do rattle on so. Tell me about yourself, Harold. What do you do when you aren't visiting funerals?
Well, it's all very thrilling, of course, but I ask you, Harold... Is it enough?
What do you mean?
I should like to change into a sunflower most of all. They are so <u>tall</u> and simple. And you, Harold, what flower would you like to be?
I don't know. Just one of those.
Why do you say that?
Because they are all the same.
Because they are all the same.
Oooh, but they are not. Look.
Boy, Maude. The way you handle cars. I'd never handle a car like that.
Oh, it's only a machine, Harold. It's not as if it were <u>alive</u>, like a horse or a camel. We may live in a machine age, but I simply can't treat them as equals. Of course, the age has its advantages.
The universal language of mankind. What music do you like, Harold?
Well...
What happened?
Look.
Look.
What?
What?
Over there by the courthouse.
Over there by the courthouse.
What is it?
What is it?
That little tree. It's in trouble. Come on.
Look at it, Harold. It's suffocating. It's the smog. People can live with it, but it gives trees asthma. They can't breathe. See the leaves are all brown. Harold, we've got to do something about this life.
But what?
But what?
We'll transplant it. To the forest.
We'll transplant it. To the forest.
But we can't just dig it up!
But we can't just dig it up!
Why not?
Why not?
But this is public property.
But this is public property.
Exactly.
Don't you think we should get some tools, maybe?
Yes, you're right. We'll go see Glaucus. Come on.
Yes, you're right. We'll go see Glaucus. Come on.
Oh, wait, Maude. Look!
Oh, my. We're too late.
Is he all right?
Is he all right?
He's fallen asleep, as usual.
We'll come back in the morning.
What is that he's working on?
What is that he's working on?
An ice sculpture. It's Venus - the Goddess of Love, the completion of which is his unfulfilled dream.
An ice sculpture. It's Venus - the Goddess of Love, the completion of which is his unfulfilled dream.
It is kind of rough.
It is kind of rough.
He's never finished one yet. He has around him every kind of hand tool known to man, but the poor dear has difficulty staying awake.
He's never finished one yet. He has around him every kind of hand tool known to man, but the poor dear has difficulty staying awake.
Look, the ice is melting.
Look, the ice is melting.
Yes.
A little after-dinner liqueur, Harold?
Well, I really don't drink...
Well, I really don't drink...
Oh, it's all right. It's organic.
Thank you.
Some nuts? Some licorice? It has no nutritional value but then consistency is not really a human trait.
Some nuts? Some licorice? It has no nutritional value but then consistency is not really a human trait.
Thank you.
What's that?
My umbrella? Oh, that's just a relic. I found it when I was packing to come to America. It used to be my defense on picket lines and rallies and political meetings - being dragged off by police or attacked by thugs of the opposition. A long time ago.

Oh, Big Issues. Liberty. Rights. Justice. Kings died and kingdoms fell. I don't regret the kingdoms - what sense in borders and nations and patriotism - but I do miss the kings. When I was a little girl I was taken to the palace in Vienna, to a garden party. I can still see the sunshine, the parasols, and the flashing uniforms of the
No.
No more revolts.
No more revolts.
Oh, yes! Every day. But I don't need a defense anymore. I embrace! Still fighting for the Big Issues but now in my small, individual way. Shall we have a song?
Oh, yes! Every day. But I don't need a defense anymore. I embrace! Still fighting for the Big Issues but now in my small, individual way. Shall we have a song?
Well, I don't...
Well, I don't...
Oh come on. I'll teach you.
Oh, that was fun. Let's play something together.
But I don't play anything.
But I don't play anything.
Don't play anything! Dear me. Everyone should be able to make some music. Why, it's life! - Rhythm and harmony - That's the cosmic dance. Come with me.
Okay?
Superb.
I think he's following us.
Is he? Ah, the police. Always wanting to play games. Well, here goes.
He's stopped.
The old double U-turn. Gets them every time.
There. Oh, I like the feel of soil, don't you? And the smell. It's the earth. "The earth is my body. My head is in the stars." Who said that?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I suppose I did. Well, farewell little tree. Grow up tall, and change, and fall to replenish the earth. Isn't it wonderful, Harold? All around us. Living things.
Oh, those motorcycles are awfully chilly.
Yeah. And it is cold in here. Hello, Glaucus.
I <u>think</u> I see it.
Yes. It's almost there.
The ice is melting.
Yes.
Yes.
Don't you think we should turn off the heat?
Don't you think we should turn off the heat?
Why? There'll be a new block of ice in the morning.
I like Glaucus.
Yes, so do I. But I think he is a little... old-fashioned. Like a puff, Harold?
Yes, so do I. But I think he is a little... old-fashioned. Like a puff, Harold?
Well, I really don't smoke.

It's all right. It's organic.

Vice? Virtue? It's best not to be too moral. You cheat yourself out of too much life. Aim above morality. As Confucius says, "Don't simply be good. Make good things happen."

Me! When I look around me I know I know nothing. I remember though, once long ago in Persia, we met a wise man in the bazaar. He was a professional and used to sell his wisdom to anyone willing to pay. His specialty for tourists was a maxim engraved on the head of a pin. "The wisest," he said, "the truest, the most

Yes. I haven't lived. I've died a few times.
What was that?

Died! Seventeen times - not counting maiming. Shot myself in the face once with a popgun and a pellet of blood.

Well, it's a question of timing, and the right equipment, and plenty of patience... You really want to hear about this?

Of course.
Of course.
Okay.
Yes. I understand. A lot of people enjoy being dead. But they are not dead really. They're just backing away from life. They're players - but they sit on the bench. The game goes on before them. At any moment they can join in. Reach out! Take a chance! Get hurt maybe. But play as well as you can. Go team, go! Give me
I like you, Maude.
I like you, Maude.
I like you, Harold. Come, I'll teach you to waltz.
Look at that sky. It's so big.
It's so blue.
It's so blue.
And beyond the blue is the blackness of the cosmos.
And beyond the blue is the blackness of the cosmos.

Maude, do you pray?
Maude, do you pray?
Pray? No. I communicate.
Pray? No. I communicate.
With God?

With Life.
This is really nice. Makes me feel like a kid. I want to do somersaults .
Well, why don't you?
Well, why don't you?
No. I'd feel stupid.
No. I'd feel stupid.
Harold, everyone has the right to make an ass out of themselves. You just can't let the world judge you too much.
Want to join me in some cartwheels?
No. I feel more like - yodeling.
No. I feel more like - yodeling.
Yodeling?
It's sinking, Harold. Going over the horizon - where we are all going to go. It's getting dark. "Let each man hold on to his candle and get a light where'er he can."
Where's that?
Where's that?
From the guys who got the matches, of course.
From the guys who got the matches, of course.
Boy! It sure has been a wonderful day. And you - you are beautiful.
Oh, Harold. You make me feel like a schoolgirl.
Shall I drop by tomorrow? Oh, I have a luncheon date. With this girl.
Shall I drop by tomorrow? Oh, I have a luncheon date. With this girl.
Oh.
Oh.
I've never met her. My mother set it up.
I've never met her. My mother set it up.
Well, be kind. I've lived a long time, Harold, seen evil as well as good, and it has been my experience that kindness...
Maude, I must speak to you.
What is it, Harold?
What is it, Harold?
They're going to draft me. In the Army. I'm going to be sent away.
They're going to draft me. In the Army. I'm going to be sent away.

But they have.
Well, don't go.
But they'll put me in jail.
Really. Just put it there, Harold.
They'd put you in jail, eh? Well, historically you'd be in very good company. That's what my husband used to say when we were in the French Underground dealing with the Gestapo. Would you like to do a little raking? Work, I'm told, done with no selfish interest, purifies the mind. You sink your separate self and become one with the universal self. On
Maude, do you think you can help me?
Maude, do you think you can help me?
What? With your skill and my experience... I think we can come up with something.
Don't you talk to me like that, you little foul mouth degenerate! Really, sir, I thought that you at least...
Traitor! Benedict Arnold! Remember Nathan Hale, right, sir?
Don't you advance on me.
... of you. You'll all end up like this.
Just like this.
Give me that. I'm going to throw it in the sewer where it belongs.
Give me that. I'm going to throw it in the sewer where it belongs.
She took my head.
That wasn't very scary.
No. It had nothing on this afternoon.
No. It had nothing on this afternoon.
Oh, you weren't scared.
Oh, you weren't scared.
Scared? Swimming underwater with that oxygen device of yours. I was petrified.
Scared? Swimming underwater with that oxygen device of yours. I was petrified.
Come on, you loved it. It was a new experience.
How about some candy floss?
Right on! It wouldn't be a celebration without it.
You sure have a way with people.
Well, they're my species.
Look at the stars.
Yes. They're old friends.
Yes. They're old friends.
Do you think there is any life up there?

We <u>are</u> alone - you and me and everybody. But we can look at those stars and maybe someone down the beach or across the sea in China is looking at them, too. Someone we don't know and most likely will never see - that someone is breathing along with us. And the star- gazers of the past - from peasant to princes -

You should have been a poet.
You should have been a poet.
Oh, no. But I should have liked to have been an astronaut. A private astronaut able to just go out and explore. Like the men who sailed with Magellan, I want to see if we really can fall off the edge of the world. What a joke it will be if like them I -
- end where I began.
Maude.
Maude.
Yes.
Yes.
Here.
Why are there no photographs in these frames?
I took them out.
I took them out.
Why?
Why?
They mocked me. They were representations of people I dearly loved yet they knew these people were gradually fading from me, and that in time all I would have left would be vague feelings - but sharp photographs! So I tossed them out. My memory fades, I know. But I prefer pictures made by me with feeling, and not by Kodak with silver nitrate.

I'll never forget you, Maude. But I would like a photo of you.
It looks like you. Thanks.
Harold, that picture is almost twenty-five years old.
Harold, that picture is almost twenty-five years old.
You haven't changed a bit. I'll put it in my wallet.
I was remembering how much this meant to me. It was after the war... I had nothing... except my life. How different I was then - and yet how the same.
You've never cried before. I never thought you would. I thought, despite anything, you could always be happy.
You've never cried before. I never thought you would. I thought, despite anything, you could always be happy.
Oh, Harold. You are so young.
Supper for two.
Oh, you've thought of everything. And champagne.

It's all right. It's organic.
It's all right. It's organic.

For you.
... which I hope will make you very happy.
Oh, I am happy, Harold. Ecstatically happy. I couldn't imagine a lovelier farewell.
Oh, I am happy, Harold. Ecstatically happy. I couldn't imagine a lovelier farewell.
Farewell?
Farewell?
Why yes. It's my eightieth birthday.
Why yes. It's my eightieth birthday.
But you're not going anywhere, are you?
But you're not going anywhere, are you?
Oh yes, dear. I took the pills an hour ago. I should be gone by midnight.
Oh, Harold! What a fuss this is. So unnecessary.
Maude, please. Don't die. I couldn't bear it. Please, don't die.
Maude, please. Don't die. I couldn't bear it. Please, don't die.
But, Harold, we begin to die as soon as we are born. What is so strange about death? It's no surprise. It's part of life. It's change.
But, Harold, we begin to die as soon as we are born. What is so strange about death? It's no surprise. It's part of life. It's change.
But why now?
But why now?
I thought eighty was a good round number.
I feel giddy.
But Maude, you don't understand. I love you. Do you hear me? I've never said that to anyone in my life before. You're the first. Maude. Please don't leave me.
But Maude, you don't understand. I love you. Do you hear me? I've never said that to anyone in my life before. You're the first. Maude. Please don't leave me.
Oh, Harold, don't upset yourself so.
Oh, Harold, don't upset yourself so.
It's true. I can't live without you.
It's true. I can't live without you.
"And this too shall pass away."
"And this too shall pass away."
Never! Never! I'll never forget you. I wanted to marry you. Don't you understand! I love you. I love you!
Never! Never! I'll never forget you. I wanted to marry you. Don't you understand! I love you. I love you!
Oh! That's wonderful, Harold. Go - and love some more.
Chardin. Dame Marjorie. But you may call me Maude.
Please! She has got to see a doctor right away.
Please, don't you realize? She is dying.
Well, not <u>dying</u>, actually. I'm changing. You know, like from winter to spring. Of course, it is a big step to take.
Of course, Harold's father had a similar sense of the absurd. I remember once in Paris he stepped out for cigarettes and the next I hear he's arrested for floating nude down the Seine - experimenting in river currents with a pair of yellow rubber water wings. Well, that cost quite a little bit of "enfluence" and "d'argent" to hush up, I can tell
I have a sore throat.
I have a sore throat.
Well, I want you to go to bed directly after dinner. You know how susceptible you are to colds. Harold has always been a delicate child. Even as a baby he seemed to be abnormally prone to illness - Harold, dear, eat up your beets...
Mother.
Not now, Harold... You can't put me down for Monday?
Not now, Harold... You can't put me down for Monday?
Mother.
Mother.
Harold, please! I'm on the phone.
Harold, please! I'm on the phone.
Mother. I'm going to get married.
Mother. I'm going to get married.
Fay, I'll call you back. What did you say?
Fay, I'll call you back. What did you say?
I'm getting married.
I'm getting married.
To whom?
To whom?
To a girl. Here.
I suppose you think this is very funny, Harold.
What?
What?
A sunflower?
Love? Love? What do you <u>know</u> about her? Where does she come from? Where did you meet her?
At a funeral.
At a funeral.
Oh... That's wonderful... I get an eighty-year-old pallbearer for a daughter-in-law! Be reasonable, Harold! You're dealing with your life! What will people say?!
Oh... That's wonderful... I get an eighty-year-old pallbearer for a daughter-in-law! Be reasonable, Harold! You're dealing with your life! What will people say?!
I don't care what people say.
I don't care what people say.
You don't care! "Miss Shroud of 1890 Weds the Boy of a Thousand Deaths!" Listen to me...
I'm going to marry the woman I love.
Harold!
This is insane.
Perhaps it is.
How do you do?
Can't complain.
Would you like a cigarette?
No, thank you. They stain my fingers.
Is Sunshine your real name?
Well, actually, it was the name of my drama teacher - Louis Sunshine. Perhaps you've heard of him. He was such an influence on the development of my instrument. That means my body - in theatre talk. Well, when I came to Hollywood I felt the need to express the emerging me in a new form, so I took on "Sunshine." Dore is my
Do you play?
No. I'm learning the banjo. Do you?
No. I'm learning the banjo. Do you?
Oh, I studied the guitar. I had to give it up. Gave me calluses on my fingers. As an actress I can't afford to have a tarnished instrument.
Oh, is this your father?
No. My uncle.
No. My uncle.
Oh, he's in the Army. I do so like the military, don't you? Those uniforms make men look so virile. I did "What Price Glory?" in summer stock. I played Charmaine - with a French accent.
This one is particularly interesting. It's a hari-kari blade.
Ohhh. What's hari-kari?
Ohhh. What's hari-kari?
An ancient Japanese ceremony.
An ancient Japanese ceremony.
Like a tea ceremony?
Like a tea ceremony?
No. Like this.
Tell me, Harold, how many of these, eh, suicides have you performed?
An accurate number would be difficult to gauge.

And why is that?

Well, some worked out better than others - some had to be abandoned in the planning stages - do you include the first time? - then there's the question of maiming...

And were they all done for your mother's benefit?
And were they all done for your mother's benefit?
I wouldn't say "benefit."
I wouldn't say "benefit."
No, I suppose not. How do you feel about your mother?
I don't think I'm getting through to Mother like I used to.
Does that worry you?
Does that worry you?
Yes. It does.
Yes. It does.
Why?
Why?
I put a lot of effort into these things.
I put a lot of effort into these things.
Ah, yes.

And a lot of time.

I'm sure. But what else do you do with your time? Do you go to school?

You mean when I'm not working on a...
You mean when I'm not working on a...
Yes. What kind of things do you do?
I see. Junkyards. What is the fascination there?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Is it the machines? The noise? The people?
Is it the machines? The noise? The people?
No. It's the junk. I like to look at junk.
No. It's the junk. I like to look at junk.
What else do you like?
That's very interesting, Harold, and I think very illuminative. There seems to be a definite pattern emerging. Your fondness for useless machines and demolitions seems indicative of your present emotional state, your self-destructive urges and your alienation from the regular social interaction. What do you think? And of course this pattern once isolated can be coped with. Recognize the problem and you are half
I go to funerals.
Harold?
Huh?
Huh?
You don't seem to be listening. I asked do you have any friends?
You don't seem to be listening. I asked do you have any friends?
No.
No.
None at all?

Well, maybe one.

Would you care to talk about this friend?

Your studies?

Then why did you leave?
Then why did you leave?
I burnt down the Chemistry building.
We are not relating today, Harold. I sense a definite resistance. A lack of true and helpful communication. I find you a very interesting case, Harold, but this reluctance of yours is detrimental to the psycho-analytical process, and can only hinder the possibility of effective treatment. Do you understand?
Yes.
Yes.
Very well. Now your mother tells me she is arranging several dates for you with some young ladies. How do you feel about that?
I see. Tell me, Harold, do you remember your father at all?
No. I'd have liked to.
No. I'd have liked to.
Why?
Why?
I'd have liked to talk to him.
I'd have liked to talk to him.
What would you say?
What would you say?
I'd show him my hearse. And my room, and stuff.
I'd show him my hearse. And my room, and stuff.
What kind of stuff?
Good idea of yours to come out here, Harold. It's a lovely spot.
Thank you, Uncle.
Thank you, Uncle.
Call me "sir," Harold. First thing you learn in the Army - an officer deserves your respect.
Call me "sir," Harold. First thing you learn in the Army - an officer deserves your respect.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Perfectly lovely. You know, this is what we're defending. Everything that's good and beautiful in the American way of life. Oh, there's some nut peace petitioner over there. Let's go off this way. Those crazy Commie bastards. I don't know why we tolerate 'em. Parasites.
Let's examine the facts on it. I say this country has been too harsh in its outright condemnation of war. I say you can point to many material advantages brought about by a crisis and conflict policy. Hell, World War II gave us the ballpoint pen. That's common knowledge.
During wartime the national suicide rate goes down.
During wartime the national suicide rate goes down.
Is that a fact? Well, that fits in right along with everything I've been saying. War is not all black.
Is that a fact? Well, that fits in right along with everything I've been saying. War is not all black.
War is not all black.
And so I ask you - why the hell did we give up on the Germans? Those damn politicians in Washington chalked them up on our side and the wars ever since have been a national disgrace. Hell, look at history. The two best wars this country has fought were against the Jerries. Now I say, get the Krauts on the other side of
Jeez, sir. That's pretty strong stuff.
They came at me from all sides, hundreds of 'em. We kept firing - Zat-Tat-Tat-Tat! "Throw the grenades," I shouted. "Mac, throw the grenades!" "He's dead," Joe said, and kept right on feeding me bullets. Zat-Tat-Tat-Tat! They kept falling, but they kept coming. Bullets whizzing all around me. Zot! Joe falls back with a neat red hole in his head. I thought I was
Jeez! That's a great story,
Jeez! That's a great story,
Well, you'll soon have stories like that to tell of your own.

What's the chance of getting one of these?
Boy, to think I could maybe make my own.
Harold! That's <u>disgusting</u>!
Parasite!
Harold!
Harold!
Crazy parasite! Commie bastard! Get out of here.
Harold, calm down! This is...
She's a Commie pig. We're going to nail every last one...
Stay where you are, Harold .
She took my head.
Good afternoon, Officer. Bit of trouble here?
Yes, ma'am. Somebody had some trouble parking.
Yes, ma'am. Somebody had some trouble parking.
Well, it's a tricky turn.
Well, it's a tricky turn.
Eh, yes, ma'm.
Eh, yes, ma'm.
Tell me -- -- is that car parked all right?
Tell me -- -- is that car parked all right?
Oh yes. That's fine.
Oh yes. That's fine.
Well, thank you. Eh, officer, you might turn off the radio. Saves the battery.
Ah! There you are, madam. Were not you the lady who drove my car off yesterday?
Was that the one with the St. Christopher medal on the dashboard?
Was that the one with the St. Christopher medal on the dashboard?
Yes.
Yes.
Then I suppose it was me. Get in, Harold.
Were you also the one who painted the statues?
Oh, yes. How did you like that?
Oh, yes. How did you like that?
Well, I didn't.
Well, I didn't.
Oh, don't be too discouraged. For aesthetic appreciation - always a little time.
Oh, don't be too discouraged. For aesthetic appreciation - always a little time.
But wait...
Oh, Kirsty; so eager to play, so reluctant to admit it.
Perhaps you're teasing us. Are you teasing us?
It's different for us.
We've always been here.
We've always been here.
We have no more surprises.
Oh. No Boxes. Such a shame.
No more delays, Kirsty. No more teasing. Time to play.
No more delays, Kirsty. No more teasing. Time to play.

Well, well. All my family together again. How very sweet.

You knew?

Yes. You're a girl who remembers her promises.
Yes. You're a girl who remembers her promises.
Oh, I do. I do.
Oh, right. Daddy's died and gone to heaven, eh?
Yes!
Yes!
Shit. Bull. Shit.
See? He's here. You should learn to believe your Uncle Frank.
No! He SHOULDN'T be here! It SHOULD'VE been a trick!
No! He SHOULDN'T be here! It SHOULD'VE been a trick!
'Fraid not, baby. He belongs here. With me. We're the same. Brothers. Equal and opposite. Pure appetite. Pure banality. Too much feeling. None at all.
He... he loved me.
Don't waste your tears. Look at him!
Daddy! Daddy! I love you! Help me!
I'm your Daddy now, Kirsty.
Yes... Yes. You look...
Surreal? Strange? Nightmarish?
Surreal? Strange? Nightmarish?
No. You look...
It's a beautiful dress...
I know.
She's done it.
She certainly has.
She certainly has.
It's coming.
It's coming.
It certainly is.
I want to go back!
Sorry, friend. No day trips to Hell. Here you are. Here you stay. And forward the only way to go.
I knew you'd come back.
I'm a girl who keeps her promises.
So... You're Kirsty, huh?
You a doctor, too?
Sad, huh? She's been here six months. Her name's TIFFANY.
What's the matter with her?
What's the matter with her?
Almost complete withdrawal. She hasn't said a word for nearly two years.
Almost complete withdrawal. She hasn't said a word for nearly two years.
God, that's terrible.
God, that's terrible.
Yeah. Doctor Malahide's got her doing these jig-saws and things, though. Says it's helping to bring her out.
I... I had a visitor.
What?
What?
Oh, Jesus. I can't explain. It's... it's. I don't know how to help! I have to save him and I don't know how to help!
Oh, Jesus. I can't explain. It's... it's. I don't know how to help! I have to save him and I don't know how to help!
Kirsty, I'm sorry... don't understand. I...
Kirsty, I'm sorry... don't understand. I...
I know. No-one can. But I have to save him. Where's the other doctor? He said He'd listen. He promised.
Help. No, no-one can help. I just want someone to listen or I WILL go crazy.
If anyone can help, HE can.
No bad dreams.
So you slept O.K.?
Well, the sofa isn't often used for sleeping on...
Oh yeah? On your own a lot, Huh?
And you're sure it was a woman?
God, I wish I could say no. This is going to do terrible things to my attitude, you know.
Don't worry about it. Your attitude sucks anyway.
Hey, so for it. Don't let pity stop you. I'm down. Nail me.
The box. I need the box.
The box? Like in your story? Like in his house?
What?
The Boxes. In the House. I told you.

I don't know, Kyle. You're the fucking expert. Now get out of the way!
I don't know, Kyle. You're the fucking expert. Now get out of the way!
WHY?
WHY?
Because I'm going to get my father!
O.K. Let's go.
Kyle, you don't have...
Kyle, you don't have...
I KNOW I don't have to. It's just my time of the month to be a complete fucking idiot. O.K.?
I have to go back. Or it'll never stop.
What are you talking...
What are you talking...
I've got to finish it.
I've got to finish it.
Finish what?
I'm scared.
No. Don't let it. You've come this far.
Well... G'bye.
It's been Hell.
But I didn't open it! I didn't!
Then why are you here?
Then why are you here?
I've come for my father!
But it's true, he is his own Hell. Just as you are in yours.
And what about you?
Wait!
No more deals, Kirsty. It's your flesh we want to experience, not your skill at bargaining.

Go on. But trick us again, child, and your suffering will be legendary even in Hell.
What is this? Someone else you think escaped us, like Frank?
No, No, this one didn't escape. You told me you'd always been in Hell. You were wrong. Look at it. LOOK. IT'S YOU.
No, No, this one didn't escape. You told me you'd always been in Hell. You were wrong. Look at it. LOOK. IT'S YOU.
Nonsense, I...

It's you! You HAVEN'T always been as you are. You were HUMAN. Remember. Remember all your confusions. Think!
I... remember.
You were ALL human!

What was it, kid? Smack? Angel dust? Don't tell me acid's back in fashion?
What are you talking about? Who are you?
What are you talking about? Who are you?
Oh, excuse me...
I thought Steve had talked to you?
Oh, pardon me. I obviously didn't convey my hesitation to take his story at face-value. No, YOU talk to me. But -- do me a favor? -- none of this DEMONS crap.
He talked about Demons, huh?
Yeah.
What the hell are you asking me for? Tag it. Move it.

No. It was red. Bright red.
It's got a big stone -- in its hand --

I'm in way over my head, I know that much.
You're doing fine.
And as a father, I worry about him. In medieval stories, Agent Myers, there's often a young knight, inexperienced but pure of heart...
Oh, please. I'm not "pure of heart."

Keep her safe. No matter what. I'll deal with whatever's back there.
Alone?

How big can it be?
You better have that looked at.

This isn't for real.
You solved the box. We came. Now you must come with us. Taste our pleasures.
He doesn't see us, or hear us. We belong to you, Kirsty. And you to us.

No tears please. It's a waste of good suffering.
No time for argument.
You did this before, right?
You did this before, right?
Many times.

To a man called Frank Cotton?
Nobody escapes us.
HE did. I've seen him.
Suppose he HAD slipped us. What significance has that?
I could lead you right to him. You could take him back to Hell instead of me.
We want the man who did this --
No. That wasn't the deal.
Just in time.
Stay the fuck away from me.
We've got such sights to show you --
You can keep them.

I bet you make your Daddy proud, don't you? Beautiful.
This isn't happening.
This isn't happening.
I used to tell myself that. Used to try and pretend I was dreaming all the pain. But why kid yourself? Some things have to be endured. Take it from me. And that makes the pleasures so much sweeter...
No.
One last time. Give me the box.

Don't mourn him. He was dead long before we laid a finger on him.
You bastard --
Poor baby.

Hush now. It's all right Frank's here.

But you said --

His blood... on the floor... It brought me back.

Just help, will you? Please God, help me --
...somebody...
Ssh!
You can't let me stay like this. Please. You can't.
What do you want me to do.
What do you want me to do.
The blood brought me this far. I need more of the same. Or I'll slip back...
I'm hurting
Hurting.
Hurting.
My nerves... are beginning to work again.
My nerves... are beginning to work again.
Good.
Good.
One more. Maybe two --
-- to heal me completely. Then we can be away from here, before they come looking.
Who?
Who?
The Cenobites. It's only a matter of time before they find I've slipped them. I have to get away from here.
Poor Larry. Obedient as ever.
Keep your voice down.
Ssh. Don't want babe to hear.
You're hurting.
You're hurting.
You won't cheat me will you? You'll stay with me. Help me. Then we can be together, the way we were before. We belong to each other now, for better or worse...
Well?
Better. Very much better. I'd like something to wear. And some cigarettes. Will you bring me some?
Better. Very much better. I'd like something to wear. And some cigarettes. Will you bring me some?

I want an explanation first. I want to know what happened to you.
I want an explanation first. I want to know what happened to you.
Not know.
Not know.
Tell me, damn you.
A long time.
You promised me an explanation.
This is what began it.
A box?
A box?
It's not any box. It's called the Lament Configuration. It's a puzzle.
It's not any box. It's called the Lament Configuration. It's a puzzle.
Let me see.
Let me see.
Don't touch it. It's dangerous. It opens doors.
Don't touch it. It's dangerous. It opens doors.
What kind of doors?
What kind of doors?
To experience beyond anything ever known. At least that's what I was promised when I bought it. Pleasure from Heaven or Hell. I didn't much care which.
To experience beyond anything ever known. At least that's what I was promised when I bought it. Pleasure from Heaven or Hell. I didn't much care which.
Hell...
Hell...
I was bored. I'd done everything. I'd gone to the limits. There was nothing left to experience. At least nothing I could buy on earth.

And you came back here to solve the puzzle --
And you came back here to solve the puzzle --
Sure. Somewhere safe. Safe. Christ! They tortured me here. In this room.
Sure. Somewhere safe. Safe. Christ! They tortured me here. In this room.
Who did?
Who did?
The Cenobites. The creatures the box set free. Sometimes I think they're still here. Just behind the walls. Them and their hooks and their beasts. Just waiting to break out again. Except that I've got the box.

You're still afraid.
You're still afraid.
You would be. They tore me apart.
You would be. They tore me apart.
So you were cheated.
So you were cheated.
No. They gave me experiences beyond the limits. Pain and pleasure, indivisible.
They took my body, but my spirit... they left that here. In the boards, in the walls. Watching the world, but not able to TOUCH it.
And the blood let you out?
And the blood let you out?
It gave me a little chance, and I took it. They won't get me back. I'm going to live, and you're going to help me. Yes?
It gave me a little chance, and I took it. They won't get me back. I'm going to live, and you're going to help me. Yes?
Yes. They'll never find us.
You can't love him.
I don't.
I don't.
So where's the harm?
So where's the harm?
I said no.
I said no.
Then find me somebody else, before they come looking.
She'll tell them everything...
I don't think so. She'll want Larry first.
I don't think so. She'll want Larry first.
That's probably her now. Or the police.

Don't you care?

There's very little I can do about it.

Well we can't just stay here --

I need a skin. Then we leave --

There's a towel in the bathroom.

Just an accident. He's all right. Will you drive? He needs stitches.

The keys are in the kitchen.

What's the problem?

I have to see my father.

You look terrible. Have you had an accident?
I was here this afternoon.

This afternoon.
This afternoon.
I saw everything.

I'm sorry, I don't follow. What was there to see?
No, damn you --
Oh my God.
It's ONE of these.
We're going to freeze to death.
We're going to freeze to death.
O.K. O.K.
Maybe somebody changed the lock.
Like who?
Like who?
Just a thought --
Just a thought --
Ah!
It smells damp.
It's just been empty a while.
How long since you were here?
The best part of ten years.
Why didn't he want to sell it?
I don't know. Probably wanted a hideaway.
Not exactly modern.
We'll sell it. Sell everything.
We'll sell it. Sell everything.
I thought half of it was your brother's?
I thought half of it was your brother's?
He won't complain. He can pay off some of his creditors.
You know we have to let Kirsty see this place, before we do anything to it. She'll love it.
You mean we're moving in?
You're still blaming me.
No. I'm not.
No. I'm not.
You wanted to come back to London. We came back.
All right.
So what's the argument?
So what's the argument?
No argument.
No argument.
Oh Christ. Julia...
Larry!
I hear you.
Where are you?
In here.
He's here?
He's BEEN here. There's stuff in the kitchen. He must have made a hasty exit.
Well?
Why not?
Why not?
We'll move in Sunday.
How are you doing through there?
It looks like a bomb's dropped.
What have you done?
I cut myself.
Is it deep?
I don't know, I haven't looked. You know me and blood.
I don't know, I haven't looked. You know me and blood.
You're NOT going to faint.

Shit.

Let me see.
It's probably going to need stitches.
I'm going to throw up.

No, you're not.
Take it slowly.
So damn stupid.

You're done worse.

I'll be scarred for life.

No you won't.
Look, I'm going to have to leave you guys to keep each other company.
Larry....
Larry....
Anyway, it's bad luck to see too much of the bride before the wedding.
Would you excuse me? I think I'm going to go to bed.
Are you O.K.?
Julia?
I'm here.
I'm here.
Sweetheart... I've been calling you.
Are you all right?
Just feeling a bit sick.

O.K.
Who was it?
Kirsty.
Is this upsetting you?
I've seen worse.
Are you all right?
Fine.
Fine.
Only I'll turn it off --

No. I'll do it.
Larry...
What's wrong with you?
Oh baby.
Don't go upstairs.

Come with me then.
Huh?

What are you talking about?

It's better you see for yourself --
Dead.
He was insane, baby: a mad dog. I put him out of his misery --
Not much fun, is it?
What?
What?
Drinking alone.
Drinking alone.
Not much.
Not much.
I wonder, maybe...
What are you drinking?
Just soda.
Just soda.
Plain soda?
Plain soda?
Please.
Please.
I try not to drink at lunch-time. Makes me sleepy in the afternoon. You like to keep a clear head, eh? One soda, one whisky. I do it anyway. No will-power. Got a busy afternoon?

You want something to drink?

I'm already way over my usual limit. You know, it's funny. I feel like I've known you for years.
Well, isn't it?
I... suppose so, yes.

So, what's your problem? Let's get to it. You're not going to change your fucking mind ?

No personal details?

That's right.
This isn't the bedroom.
No.
What's going on?
We don't need a bed, do we?
I suppose not.
I prefer the floor.
First time for everything.
That's right.
Why don't you take off your jacket? You're warm.
Yeah, why don't I?
Why don't you do the same?
Maybe I will.
You know, you're very beautiful.
Am I?
Am I?
You know you are. Loveliest woman I ever set eyes on.
Oh Christ.
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
Too much drink. Better empty my bladder.
You're awake. Good girl.
What happened to me?

I'll get the doctor.
I'll get the doctor.
Wait a moment --
Who brought me in here?
I won't be a moment.
What a pretty tune.
My father doesn't answer. I have to go find him.
My father doesn't answer. I have to go find him.
I'm afraid you'll have to wait until the police have spoken to you. Keep trying your father; he'll answer eventually.

I called another friend of mine and he's coming over. Will you let him in?
I called another friend of mine and he's coming over. Will you let him in?
Of course. This isn't a prison you know. Look if you'd prefer to tell ME what happened, instead of a policeman --
You wouldn't believe me.
Try me.
Well, if you change your mind. What's this friend's name?
Steve.
Who's there?
Daddy?
Kirsty?
I got through.

Where are you?

I found a room.

I do. I'd just feel happier if you were with us.

Would you... maybe call round sometime? Try to make friends.
Sure.

Maybe all she needs is some company.
I have to talk to you.
Of course.
It's all right, sweetheart. Julia's told me everything; and it's all right...

That's right. Kevin. She's Mrs. Kevin Bannister. She lives in Australia.
Really? Married Kevin? Her junior high sweetheart... What chance would I have had against that? None, no chance. That's just fate.
I beg your pardon?
I beg your pardon?
Technically, I'm number one. I went out with her a week before Kevin did. Her first boyfriend. Me.
TURN IT OFF, BARRY.
IT WON'T GO ANY LOUDER.
What are you doing?
I don't want to hear Public Enemy right now.

Since when did this shop become a fascist regime?

Great. That's the fun of working in a record store. Playing crappy pap you don't want to listen to. I thought this tape was going to be, you know, a conversation stimulator. I was going to ask you for your top five records to play on a Monday morning and all that, and you just had to ruin it.

We'll do it next Monday.
We'll do it next Monday.
Well what's the point in that?
Nice, Barry.
Rob. Top five musical crimes perpetrated by Stevie Wonder in the '80's and '90's. Subquestion -- is it in fact unfair to criticize a formerly great artist for his latter- day sins? "Is it better to burn out than to fade away?"

You just drove a fucking customer away, Barry.
You just drove a fucking customer away, Barry.
We didn't even really have it. I happen to know for a fact that the only Stevie Wonder single we have is "Don't Drive Drunk." I was just goofing on the straight, and it never cost you a penny.

I don't want you talking to our customers like that again.
I don't want you talking to our customers like that again.
"Our customers?" You think that Mr. L.L. Bean out there is going to be a regular?
Barry, I'm fucking broke! I know we used to fuck with anyone who asked for anything we didn't like, but it's gotta stop.
Bullshit. The guy was going to buy one record -- which we didn't even have -- and leave and never come back again anyway. Why not have a little fun? Big fucking deal.

Oh, now you're defending that motherfucker? You're going soft in your old age, Rob. There was a time when you would have chased him out of the store and up the street. Now all of a sudden I'm offending your golf buddy. You're right, Rob. I am so sorry. How are we ever going to make enough money to get you and Laura into
Yeah.
But now I kind of like it.
I wanna date a musician...
I wanna live with a musician. She'd write songs at home, ask me what she thought of them, maybe even include one of our private jokes in the liner notes.

...Maybe a picture of me in the liner notes...
What did you tell her about the shop for?
I didn't know it was classified information. I mean, I know we don't have any customers, but I thought that was a bad thing, not, like, a business strategy.
We're only on the fucking list for Marie's gig at the Pulaski Pub, that's all! All three of us.
That's fucking great, Barry. We can spend fifteen bucks on a cab to save five each. Fantastic, Barry!
That's fucking great, Barry. We can spend fifteen bucks on a cab to save five each. Fantastic, Barry!
We can take your car.
We can take your car.
It's not my car, now is it? It's Laura's car, and thus Laura has it. So it's an ass-bumping double- transferring bus ride through bumblefuck or a fat wad on a cab. Wow. Fucking great.
What?
What do you mean, "what?"

Ooh! A kind of recent record! Rob's sly declaration of new classic-status slipped into a list of old classics! Nice! "Let's Get It On?" Couldn't you make it more obvious than that?
There's something different about the sound of her voice... And what did she mean last night, she hasn't slept with him yet. Yet. What does "yet" mean, anyway? "I haven't seen... Evil Dead II yet." What does that mean? It means you're going to go, doesn't it?
-- You're like a little squirrel of music, storing away dead little nuts of old garbage music, musical lint, old shit, shit, shit --
-- You're like a little squirrel of music, storing away dead little nuts of old garbage music, musical lint, old shit, shit, shit --
-- Barry, if I were to say to you I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet, what would that mean?
Just... come on, what would it mean to you? That sentence? "I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet?"
To me, it would mean that you're a liar. You saw it twice. Once with Laura -- oops -- once with me and Dick. We had that conversation about the possibilities of the guy making ammo off-screen in the Fourteenth Century.
To me, it would mean that you're a liar. You saw it twice. Once with Laura -- oops -- once with me and Dick. We had that conversation about the possibilities of the guy making ammo off-screen in the Fourteenth Century.
Yeah, yeah, I know. But say I hadn't seen it and I said to you, "I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet," what would you think?
I'd think you were a cinematic idiot. And I'd feel sorry for you.
No, but would you think, from that one sentence. That I was going to see it?
No, but would you think, from that one sentence. That I was going to see it?
I'm sorry, Rob, but I'm struggling here. I don't understand any part of this conversation. You're asking me what I would think if you told me that you hadn't seen a film that you've seen. What am I supposed to say?
I'm sorry, Rob, but I'm struggling here. I don't understand any part of this conversation. You're asking me what I would think if you told me that you hadn't seen a film that you've seen. What am I supposed to say?
Just listen to me. If I said to you --
Just listen to me. If I said to you --
"-- I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet," yeah, yeah, I hear you --
"-- I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet," yeah, yeah, I hear you --
Would you... would you get the impression that I wanted to see it?
Would you... would you get the impression that I wanted to see it?
Well... you couldn't have been desperate to see it, otherwise you'd have already gone...
...But the word "yet..." Yeah, you know what, I'd get the impression that you wanted to see it. Otherwise you'd say you didn't really want to.
But in your opinion, would I definitely go?
But in your opinion, would I definitely go?
How the fuck am I supposed to know that? You might get sick of people telling you you've really gotta go see the movie.
Why would they care?
Because it's a brilliant film. It's funny, violent, and the soundtrack kicks fucking ass.
I never thought I would say this, but can I go work now?
Let's pack it up. We haven't had a customer in four hours.
Fine by me. I still want pay to 7 o'clock.
Ha.
Un-fucking-believable. Dick's out on a hot date, Rob's boning Marie LaSalle, and the best-looking and most intelligent of all of us isn't getting anything at all.
How do you know about that?
How do you know about that?
Oh come on, Rob. What am I, an idiot? I'm more bothered by Dick's thing. How did this happen, Dick? What rational explanation can there possibly be? What's her name?
Shut the fuck up, Barry.
Yeah, you would say that, wouldn't you? You two have to stick together now. Boners United. United in getting some.
Don't be sad, Barry. You'll find true love someday.
Suck my ass.
Suck my ass.
Terrific.
Hey.
What the fuck is that?
What the fuck is that?

What's up?
Laura. Her dad died.

Ooh. Drag.
It was Jan, and it was a long time after--

We're not as bad as you think, Rob.
We're not as bad as you think, Rob.
You couldn't be. Look, Barry. There's going to be people from Laura's work there, people who own dogs and babies and Tina Turner albums. How are you going to cope with them?

That's what we want. Reaction. And if Laura's bourgeois lawyer friends can't take it, then fuck 'em. Let 'em riot, we can handle it. We'll be ready.
I'm looking for a record for my daughter. For her birthday. "I Just Called To Say I Love You." Do you have it?
Oh yeah. We got it.
Great. Can I have it then?
No, you can't.
Why not?
Because it's sentimental tacky crap, that's why not. Do we look like the kind of store that sells "I Just Called To Say I Loved You?" Go to the mall and stop wasting our time.

What's your problem? What did I... Why are you --
What's your problem? What did I... Why are you --
Do you even know your daughter? There is no way she likes that song. Or is she in a coma?
It's almost impossible to find, especially on CD. Yet another cruel trick on all of the dumbasses who got rid of their turntables. But every other Echo and the Bunnymen album --
I have all of the others.

Oh really. Well what about the first Jesus and Mary Chain?

They always seemed...

They always seemed what? They always seemed really great, is what they always seemed. They picked up where your precious Echo left off, and you're sitting here complaining about no more Echo albums. I can't believe that you don't own that record. That's insane.
Well what about the new Echo --
Do not get ahead of yourself.
That is perverse. Do not tell anyone you don't own fucking Blonde on Blonde. What about Television?
I have a television.

NO--!
Holy Shiite! What the fuck's this?

No, no, no, you said "The Number Four With a Smile," and there's no "The" at the front of the title of the album.
No, no, no, you said "The Number Four With a Smile," and there's no "The" at the front of the title of the album.

Just that Rob seems to think it would be wiser to start a record label by putting out a record with business- crippling Nazi Youth shoplifters than with someone he knows in his bitter jealous heart is a musical visionary. That's all.
May I help you?
I'm looking for Deejay Rob Gordon.

Right. Why?
Right. Why?
Well, I used to go to the Dodger on your nights, and I saw you're doing it again and that your putting out a record, and it's sort of a then-and- now story against the backdrop of the Chicago music scene with the emphasis on now.

I thought I would ask you a few questions if that's okay.
I thought I would ask you a few questions if that's okay.
Huh. You used to come to the club? I shouldn't have let you in. You must have only been about sixteen.
What I mean is, I didn't mean you look young. You don't. You don't look old either. You look just as old as you are. A bit younger maybe, but not a lot. Not much. Just right.
So. Is now a good time?
Right. So. You must have an enormous record collection.
Yeah. I could show it to you if you want to come over and see it.
Yeah, well... Let's see... What are you're all-time top five records?
Pardon me?
Pardon me?
Your desert island top-five.
Your desert island top-five.
Oh boy... In the club, or at home?
Oh boy... In the club, or at home?
Is there a difference?
Is there a difference?
OF COURSE... Well yeah, a bit. "Sin City" by the Flying Burrito Brothers is an all-time top five, but I wouldn't play it at the club. It's a country-rock ballad. Everybody'd go home.
OF COURSE... Well yeah, a bit. "Sin City" by the Flying Burrito Brothers is an all-time top five, but I wouldn't play it at the club. It's a country-rock ballad. Everybody'd go home.

Can I go home and work this out and let you know? In a week or so?
Look if you can't think of anything, it doesn't matter. I'll do one. My five favorite from the old days at the Dodger.
Oh, I'm sure I can manage something... "Sin City." "New Rose," by The Damned. "Hit It and Quit It" by Funkadelic. "Shipbuilding," Elvis Costello, Japanese import, no horns, or different horns, anyway... um... "Mystery Train" by Elvis Presley... And... "Spaced Cowboy" by Sly and the Family Stone. A bit controversial, I know, but...
Fine. That's great.
Fine. That's great.
Is that it?
Is that it?
Well, I wouldn't mind a quick chat, if you got the time.

That's five. So. Why did you decide to deejay again?

Well it was a friend's idea, really, and the record release party seemed like a good place to do it. So... I should really put a James Brown in there --

"Music for Old People." What does that mean?
"Music for Old People." What does that mean?
Look, I'm sorry about this, but I'd like "the Upsetter" by Lee "Scratch" Perry, in there. Instead of "Sin City."
Okay. "Dance Music For Old People?"
Oh, you know... a lot of people aren't too old for clubs but they're too old for acid jazz and garage and ambient and all that. They want to hear old funk and Stax and New Wave and Old School Hip Hop and some new stuff all together and there's nowhere for them.

Why did you break up with me for Marco?

Fuck! I knew it! You're going through one of those what-does-it- all-mean things.
Fuck! I knew it! You're going through one of those what-does-it- all-mean things.
Huh?
Huh?
There's been a rash of them, recently. I find it a little unnerving. In fact Marco called a few months back, and he wanted to see me, and rehash the past as they say, and I wasn't really up for it. Do all men go through this?

C'mon, just answer the question. You can say what you like. What the hell?
It's all kind of lost in the... in the dense mists of time now... It wasn't that I really liked Marco more. In fact I thought you were more, shall we say, attractive than him. It was just that he knew he was good-looking and you didn't, and that made a difference somehow. You used to act as if I was weird for wanting
Did you tell that to Marco when he did his what-does-it-all-mean thing with you?
Did you tell that to Marco when he did his what-does-it-all-mean thing with you?
Oh God, no. I didn't want to hurt his feelings.
'Morning, Dick.
Oh, hi. Hi, Rob.

Good weekend?

Okay.
What's this?
The new Belle and Sebastian. Like it?
Hey. Didn't you steal that one already?
Can I help you?
Are you all right?
Yeah. I'm sorry... Look Dick, Laura and I broke up. She's gone. And if we ever see Barry again maybe you can tell him that.
Yeah. I'm sorry... Look Dick, Laura and I broke up. She's gone. And if we ever see Barry again maybe you can tell him that.
'Course I will, Rob. No problem. No problem at all. I'll tell him next time I see him.
I've ah... got some other stuff to tell him anyway, so it's no problem. I'll just tell him about, you know, Laura, when I tell him the other stuff.
Fine.
Fine.
I'll start with your news before I tell him mine, obviously. Mine isn't much, really, just about Marie LaSalle playing at Lounge Ax tonight. I like her, you know, she's kind of Sheryl Crowish... but, you know, good. So I'll tell him before that. Good news and bad news kind of thing.
Or rather, bad news and good news, because he likes this person playing tonight. I mean, he liked Laura too, I didn't mean that. And he likes you. It's just that --
I understand, Dick.
I understand, Dick.
Sure. 'Course. Rob, look. Do you want to... talk about it, that kind of thing?
I always hated this song.
Yeah.
Let's not.
I want a tape.
Rob.
Liz, hold on a second -- What?
Liz, hold on a second -- What?
Marie LaSalle is in the store! Here, she's here, and now!
Rob --!
-- FUCK OFF!
I will now sell four copies of Cats and Dogs by the Royal Trux.
Do it. Do it.
Well we rang $900 today.
Yeah but more than that. I'm happy because I'm proud of us. Because although our talents are small and peculiar, we use them to their best advantage.
Don't worry about it, Dick. Barry's an asshole.
Yeah... Well... I'll see you tomorrow, Rob.
I'm sorry, Rob, that's, it's --
You're a horrible person, Barry. I mean it.
Can I do anything?
"Abraham, Martin, and John." That's a nice one.
What is this.
It's Vince and Justin.
It's Vince and Justin.
Who's that?
Laura? Are you okay?
I am fine... I gotta go. Goodbye.
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm off the phone.
You look upset.

Conflict resolution is my job, Laura.
Nothing to resolve, Ian. Let's get a drink.

Hello, Rob. Remember me? I'm Ray. Ian.
What needs sorting out?
Come on, Rob. My relationship with Laura has obviously disturbed you a great deal.

We are not talking jokey understatement here, Rob. We're talking actionable harassment. Ten phone calls a night, hanging around outside my house...
Yeah, well, I've stopped all that now.
Yeah, well, I've stopped all that now.
We've noticed and we're glad. But, you know... how are we going to make peace here? We want to make things easier for you. What can we do? Obviously I know how special Laura is, and I know things can't be good for you at the moment. I'd hate it if I lost her. But I'd like to think that if she decided she

Good. So shall we leave it at that then?
Good. So shall we leave it at that then?
I dunno.
I dunno.
Think about it, Rob.
Good. So shall we leave it at that then?
I've already left it, you pathetic rebound fuck! Now get your patchouli stink out of my store.
Good. So shall we leave it at that then?
We won't leave it, Ian. Not ever.
So shall we leave it at that then?
I dunno.
I dunno.
Think about it, Rob.
You don't have to go this second. You can stay until whenever.
We've done the hard part now. I might as well, you know...
We've done the hard part now. I might as well, you know...
Well stay for tonight, then.

My house?
How can you like Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye? It's like saying you support the Israelis and the Palestinians.
It's not like saying that at all, actually, Rob. Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye make pop records --

-- Alright, alright but --
-- Alright, alright but --
-- and who says I like Marvin Gaye, anyway?
Hey! Marvin Gaye! "Got to Give It Up!" That's our song! Marvin Gaye is responsible for our entire relationship!
Is that right? I'd like a word with him.
Is that right? I'd like a word with him.
But don't you remember?
But don't you remember?
I remember the song. I just couldn't remember who sang it.
You used to care more about things like Marvin Gaye than you do now. When I first met you, and I made you that tape, you loved it. You said -- and I quote -- "It was so good it made you ashamed of your record collection."
Well, I liked you. You were a deejay, and I thought you were hot, and I didn't have a boyfriend, and I wanted one.
Well, I liked you. You were a deejay, and I thought you were hot, and I didn't have a boyfriend, and I wanted one.
So you weren't interested in music at all?
So you weren't interested in music at all?
Yeah, sure. More so then than I am now. That's life though, isn't it?
But Laura... that's me. That's all there is to me. There isn't anything else. If you've lost interest in that, you've lost interest in everything.
You really believe that?
Yes. Look at me. Look at our -- the apartment. What else do I have, other than records and CDs?
And do you like it that way?
And do you like it that way?
Not really.
Have you tackled the Great Reorganization yet?
Don't you think there are more important things to talk about than my record collection?
So. Where have you been staying for the last week?
I think you know that.
I think you know that.
Had to work it out for myself, though, didn't I?
I'm sorry. I haven't been very fair to you. That's why I came here to the store this evening. I feel terrible, Rob. This is really hard, you know.
Good. So. Is it my job?
Good. So. Is it my job?
What? Gimme a fucking break. Is that what you think? That your not big enough a deal for me? Jesus, gimme a little credit, Rob.
What? Gimme a fucking break. Is that what you think? That your not big enough a deal for me? Jesus, gimme a little credit, Rob.
I don't know. It's one of the things I thought of.
I don't know. It's one of the things I thought of.
What were the others?
What were the others?
Just the obvious stuff.
Just the obvious stuff.
What's the obvious stuff?
What's the obvious stuff?
I don't know.
I guess it's not that obvious, then.
No.
What?
What, what?
Did you say something?
No. So. Is it working out with Ian?
No. So. Is it working out with Ian?
Rob. Don't be childish.
Rob. Don't be childish.
Why is that childish? Your living with the guy! I'm just asking how it's going.
Why is that childish? Your living with the guy! I'm just asking how it's going.
I am not living with him. I've just been staying with him for a few days until I work out what I'm doing. Look, this has nothing to do with anyone else. You know that, don't you? I left because we weren't exactly getting along, and we weren't talking about it. And I suddenly realized that I like my job, and I like what

I left because we weren't exactly getting along, and we weren't talking about it. And I suddenly realized that I like my job, and I like what
Well then why don't you quit it while you seem to not be ahead?
Look. Maybe you'll grow up and we'll get it together, you and me. Maybe I'll never see either of you again. I don't know. All I know is that it's not a good time to be living here.
So, what, you haven't definitely decide to dump me? There's still a chance we'll get back together?
So, what, you haven't definitely decide to dump me? There's still a chance we'll get back together?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Well, if you don't know, there's a chance, right? It's like, if someone was in the hospital and he was seriously ill and the doctor said, I don't know if he's got a chance of survival or not, then that doesn't mean the patient's definitely going to die, now does it? It means he might live. Even if it's only a remote possibility.

I suppose so.
I suppose so.
So we have a chance of getting back together again.
So we have a chance of getting back together again.
Oh, Rob, shut up.
Oh, Rob, shut up.
Hey, I just want to know where I stand. What chance --
Hey, I just want to know where I stand. What chance --
-- I don't fucking know what chance you fucking have!
Well if you could tell me roughly it would help.
Okay, okay, we have a nine percent chance of getting back together. Does that clarify the situation?
Okay, okay, we have a nine percent chance of getting back together. Does that clarify the situation?
Yeah. Great.
Yeah. Great.
I'm too tired for this now. I know I'm asking a lot, but will you take off for a while so I can get my stuff packed up? I need to be able to think while I do it and I can't think while you're here.

Fine. One.

You won't like it.

Is it better?

Well. Sex, I guess. Is sex with him better?

Jesus Christ, Rob. Is that really what's bothering you?
Jesus Christ, Rob. Is that really what's bothering you?
Of course it is.
Of course it is.
You really think it would make a difference either way?
You really think it would make a difference either way?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Well the answer is that I don't know either. We haven't done it yet.

But not even before, when he was living upstairs?
No. I was living with you, remember? We've slept together but we haven't made love. Not yet. But I'll tell you one thing. The sleeping together is better.
No. I was living with you, remember? We've slept together but we haven't made love. Not yet. But I'll tell you one thing. The sleeping together is better.
The sleeping together is better but not the sex because you haven't done it was him yet.
The sleeping together is better but not the sex because you haven't done it was him yet.
Will you please just go?
Hi.
Hi. I've been looking for an envelope of my receipts from last month and I'm thinking I didn't take them with me. Have you seen them around?

I'm sorry to call, but I need that stuff...

So, how are you?

I told you I slept with him.

No, not -- I mean have you, you know --

Is that why you wanted to see me?
Is that why you wanted to see me?
I guess.
I guess.
Oh, Rob. What do you want me to say?
Oh, Rob. What do you want me to say?
I want you to say that you haven't, and I want it to be the truth.
You kind of have to start with Elvis Costello, but where? "Motel Matches?" "I Want You?" "I Hope You're Happy Now?" "Green Shirt?" His records should be sealed in cases that say "in case of vicious betrayal, smash glass." "Where Did You Sleep Last Night," sure, but by Robert Johnson or by Nirvana? Maybe a Liz Phair track. There are a couple to get
You must have known it would happen. You couldn't have been entirely unprepared. Like you said, I've been living with the guy. We were bound to get around to it sometime.
And anyway, I keep trying to tell you, that's not really the point, is it? The point is we got ourselves into an awful mess, Rob... Are you there? What are you thinking?
Nothing.
Nothing.
We can meet for another drink if you want. So I can explain it better. I owe you that much.

I don't have your number.

You do, huh.
Hello.
It's me.
It's me.
I figured it was. Where are you?
I figured it was. Where are you?
I think the big question here is where are you, if you don't mind my saying so, and I think I know where you are. You're running. On the run. You're running from a point that everyone hits in any relationship, and you're just going to hit it again with Ian but it's going to be with a World Music bunny- rabbit-looking earth-shoe-wearing "Doctor

Are you still in love with me?
Jesus. I do not know. I'll talk to you later.

I'm not experimenting. Why don't you go experiment.
I don't want to. Don't need to. I love you.
I don't want to. Don't need to. I love you.
You don't ever think about other people?
You don't ever think about other people?
No... not really... I mean, I think about it... but no, I don't really think about it.
I called and called but you were out. I thought I'd be gone before you got back.
Is that the last of it?
Is that the last of it?
Yep. I might have missed some stuff. I'm so used to some things being here that I don't even notice them.

Those look heavy. Where's Ian?
Those look heavy. Where's Ian?
He's at home. Listen, I can't believe he went to the store. I'm mortified, actually. I'm really sorry. He had no right to do that, and I told him so.
He's at home. Listen, I can't believe he went to the store. I'm mortified, actually. I'm really sorry. He had no right to do that, and I told him so.
It was kind of funny.
I'm sure.
You still together? Going all right?

I don't really want to talk about it, to be honest.
I don't really want to talk about it, to be honest.
That bad, eh?
That bad, eh?
You know what I mean.
Fix it up. It'll make you feel better.
I'll bet you can't remember what you were doing here, can you? I mean, how much are you making now? Sixty? Seventy? And you were living in this shitty place.
I'll bet you can't remember what you were doing here, can you? I mean, how much are you making now? Sixty? Seventy? And you were living in this shitty place.
You know I didn't mind. And it's not as if Ray's place is any better.
You know I didn't mind. And it's not as if Ray's place is any better.
I'm sorry, but can we get this straight? What is his fucking name, Ian or Ray? What do you call him?
I'm sorry, but can we get this straight? What is his fucking name, Ian or Ray? What do you call him?
Ray. I hate Ian.
Ray. I hate Ian.
I hate him too. So I just call him "Mavis." Or "Sissyboy." Or "Mavis the Sissyboy."
This is where you're supposed to say that you haven't laughed this much in ages, and then you see the error of your ways.
You make me laugh much more than Ray does, if that's what you're getting at. But I already knew you could make me laugh. It's everything else I don't know about.

Mmm hmm.

You know that I can cook my ass off when I feel like it.

Oh ho, so very infrequently.
Don't forget your CDs.
Those aren't mine.
Those aren't mine.
Sure they are.
Sure they are.
They're not really, though, are they? I know you bought them for me, and that was really sweet of you, but that was when you were trying to turn me into you. I can't take them, I know they'd just sit around staring at me, and I'd feel embarrassed by them and... they don't fit in with the rest of what's mine, do you

I got it. You like Sting but you don't like Gram Parsons, because you've never heard of him.
I got it. You like Sting but you don't like Gram Parsons, because you've never heard of him.
You're being deliberately obtuse.
You're being deliberately obtuse.
I guess I am.
I guess I am.
Well, think about it.
Hello.
Hey, how ya doin'?
Guess who I just saw, right by my store? Ian. In Starbuck's. Neat, huh?
I can't talk right now.
I can't talk right now.
God, that's a cold and a half. Maybe you should bet back in bed.
Are you alright?
Pigsty.
Pigsty.
Don't worry about it. Just get into bed. Worry about that when you're better.

Pig died.

Who the fuck's Pig?

My dad died. My dad, my dad.
I'm sorry.
No, no. When are you going home?
No, no. When are you going home?
In a minute. When I get it together.
Me?
My dad liked you. And Mom never told him we'd split, because he wasn't up to it and... oh, I don't know. I don't really understand it. I think she thinks he'll be able to see what's going on. It's like... He's been through so much, what with dying and everything, that she doesn't want to upset him any more than she has to.

Do you want me to be there?
Do you want me to be there?
I don't care. As long as you don't expect me to hold your hand.
Look, are you coming or not?
Yes, of course.
Yes, of course.
Liz'll give you a lift. She knows where to go and everything... I don't have time to talk, Rob. I've got too much to do.
Liz'll give you a lift. She knows where to go and everything... I don't have time to talk, Rob. I've got too much to do.
Sure. I'll see you on Friday.
Are you going to lie in that flower bed all night?
Uh... No.
You're soaking.
Mmnn.
Mmnn.
You're also an idiot.
I can see why you say that. Look, I'm sorry. I really am. The last thing I wanted was... that's why I left, because... I lost it, and I didn't want to blow my top in there, and... look, the reason I fucked everything up was because I was scared. I just wanted you to know, that's all.
Thank you. I appreciate it. I can't reciprocate.
Thank you. I appreciate it. I can't reciprocate.
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
I didn't mess things up because I was scared. I slept with Ray because I was sick of you. And I needed something to snap me out of it.
I didn't mess things up because I was scared. I slept with Ray because I was sick of you. And I needed something to snap me out of it.
Sure, I understand. Look, I don't want to take up any more of your time. You get back, and I'll wait here for a bus.

I don't want to go back.
I don't want to go back.
What do you want to do?
What do you want to do?
C'mon.
When are you going back?
I don't know. Sometime. Later. Listen, Rob, would you have sex with me?
I don't know. Sometime. Later. Listen, Rob, would you have sex with me?
What?
What?
I want to feel something else than this. It's either that or I go home and put my hand in the fire. Unless you want to stub cigarettes out on my arm.

It'll have to be sex, then.
Hello. It doesn't seem so long ago that I looked at you from here.
Hi.
Hi.
I knew there was a reason I wore a skirt today.
You know, with Ray...
Oh, Rob, we're not going to go through that again.
Oh, Rob, we're not going to go through that again.
No, no. It's not... are you still on the pill?
No, no. It's not... are you still on the pill?
Yes, of course. There's nothing to worry about.
Yes, of course. There's nothing to worry about.
I didn't mean that. I mean... was that all you used?
Look, we can do other things.
I lived with you. You were my partner just a few weeks ago and now you're worried I might kill you, and you're entitled to worry. Isn't that a terrible thing? Isn't that sad?
Laura...
I'm too tired not to go out with you.
So if you had a bit more energy we'd stay split. But things being how they are, what with you wiped out, you'd like us to get back together.
Everything's too hard. Maybe another time I would have the guts to be on my own, but not now I don't.
Everything's too hard. Maybe another time I would have the guts to be on my own, but not now I don't.
What about Ian?
What about Ian?
Ray's a disaster. I don't know what that was all about, except that sometimes you need someone to lob into the middle of a bad relationship like a hand grenade, I guess, and blow it all apart.

Mission accomplished.
Mission accomplished.
I know it's not very romantic, but there will be romance again at some stage, I'm sure. I just... I need you, Rob. That's it. And we know each other and we care for each other, and you've made it clear that you want me back, so...
Let's go home. Okay?
Okay.
C'mon. I want to know.
Want to know what, exactly?
Want to know what, exactly?
What it was like.
What it was like.
It was like sex. What else could it be like?
It was like sex. What else could it be like?
Was it like good sex or was it like bad sex?
Was it like good sex or was it like bad sex?
What's the difference?

You know the difference.
You know the difference.
Look, we're okay now. We just had a nice time. Let's leave it at that.
Look, we're okay now. We just had a nice time. Let's leave it at that.
Okay, that's cool, okay. But the nice time we just had... was it nicer, as nice, or less nice than the nice times you were having a couple of weeks ago?
Oh, c'mon, Laura. Just say something. Lie, if you want. It'd stop me asking you questions and it'd make me feel better.
Well I was gonna lie and now I can't, because you'd know I was lying.
Well I was gonna lie and now I can't, because you'd know I was lying.
Well why the fuck would you want to lie, anyway?
Well why the fuck would you want to lie, anyway?
To make you feel better.
To make you feel better.
Oh, great...
Look, Rob. If great sex was as important as you think it is, and if I was having great sex with him, then we wouldn't be lying here now. And that is my last word on the subject, okay?
Okay.
... Like Mexico. Or Jamaica. Or New York, even.
Hey, great idea. What I'll do is, tomorrow I'll get a hold of a box full of mint Elvis Presley 78s on the Sub label, and I'll pay for it that way.

I'll pay for you. Even though you owe me money. We have to do something with the money I earn. I need to. I deserve it. You can just think of it as winning the lottery.

Money does not matter. I do not care how much you earn. I'd just like you to be a little happier in your work, but beyond that you can do what you like.

But it wasn't supposed to be like this. When I met you we were the same people and now we're not, and...
How? How were we the same people?
How? How were we the same people?
Well, you were the kind of person who came to the Artful Dodger and I was the kind of person who deejayed at the Artful Dodger. You wore jeans and T-shirts, and so did I. And I still do, and you don't.

Because I'm not allowed to. I still do, after work. So, what? Should we just break up? Is that what you're saying? Because if you are, I'm going to run out of patience.

You haven't changed so much as a pair of socks in the years I've known you. If we've grown apart, then I'm the one who's done the growing, and all I've done is change jobs.

I'm alright.
I'm alright.
Yeah, you're alright. But you're certainly not happy. So what happens if you get happy? And yes I know that's the title of an Elvis Costello album, I use the reference deliberately to catch your attention. Should we split up because I'm used to you being miserable? What happens if you, I don't know, start you're own record label, and it's a success? Time

You're being stupid.
You're being stupid.
How? What would be the difference between you having a record label and me going from legal aid to private practice?
All I'm saying is, you have to allow for things to happen to people, most of all to yourself. Otherwise, what's the use?
No use.
Hi.

I know. But you've never met. It just seems like a stone unturned in your relationship with him.
I know. But you've never met. It just seems like a stone unturned in your relationship with him.
Ha.
You did that deliberately. You knew all along I'd like them. It was a trick.
I tricked you into meeting some people you'd think were great. I thought it would be fun to introduce you to someone with a Tina Turner album and then see whether you still felt the same way.
I called Dan Koretzky because he --
Has Drag City Records, I know, I know. You told Dan Koretzky about this?
Has Drag City Records, I know, I know. You told Dan Koretzky about this?
Yeah, and he said it's a good way to break out a record. Especially for what he said, and I quote, "would be a highly anticipated event, locally." He helped me put out a press release.

Yeah. His band is playing a set.
They'll go on early. Nobody will even be there yet and I told them they can't play for more than a half hour.
It's no joke. I'm responsible for what happens, you know. Embarrassment aside, there's a lot of money and effort in this, at least by my standards. I have to put down a deposit for the room. I have to pay the pressing plant for the records, sleeve them, sticker them --

We took care of that.
I'm sorry I've been acting like a jerk. I do appreciate what you've done for me, and I know you've done it for the best possible reasons, and I do love you, even though I act like I don't.
That's okay. You seem pissed off all the time, though.

How're you holding up?

Actually, I'm fine. I'm great. Last night I got to thinking, "you know what? Maybe it is time to move on. Maybe we're just not right for each other. Or maybe we are. But time will tell and at this point I'm going to be fine with whatever's meant to be." You know?

Yeah. Like I said, I don't want to take sides. And I like Laura with you. She's more fun, more open. You guys are good together. I just wish you two could, I don't know. I don't think much of this Ian guy --
What's the -- hey, Liz --
-- No, no, no, don't even. I talked to Laura, Rob. I talked to her and she gave me a little background. And you're a fucking ASSHOLE.
To think I sympathized with you for two seconds! Poor Rob! Laura left him out of nowhere for the schmuck upstairs. You let me believe that!
It's true!
It's true!
Rob! Two years ago you got Laura pregnant; you then proceeded to cheat on her! You borrowed money from her and never paid a dime back! And then, just a few weeks ago, you told her you were unhappy with her and were "kind of looking around for somebody else!"

I know I can't speak now because Laura's father died, and I just have to take it because otherwise I'm a bad guy, with the emphasis on guy, self-centered. Well, I'm fucking not, not all the time, anyway, I'm really sorry Jo. But you know, Liz... I can either stick up for myself or believe everything you say about me and end up hating

So you live in Chicago now?
Yup. Not far from here, actually.
Don't you like that?
No, no, I love, it's just, thinking you're, you must be so sick of it... Well.
Hi, Marie.
Everything go alright?
She just wanted to pick up some stuff. No big thing. A relief, actually.
God, I hate that time. That pick up stuff time. I just went through that before I came here. You know that song "Patsy Cline Times Two" I play? That's about me and my ex dividing up our record collections.

Thank you.
Is that why you came to Chicago in the first place? Because of, you know, dividing up your record collection and stuff?
Yup.
You share a place with T-Bone?
No way! I'd cramp his style. And I wouldn't want to listen to all that stuff happening on the other side of the bedroom wall. I'm way to unattached for that.

Yeah, I know the Crumblers! I bought a used Blasters album in New York about ten years ago and somebody left a Crumblers single in it. My everything changed for a couple of weeks.
Books, records, films -- these things matter. Call me shallow but it's the damn truth, and by this measure I was having one of the best dates of my life.

No, we...
Uh, yes I, like, do... It's simple. You make the tracks -- recording studio -- deliver them to the pressing plant where a master is cut, the master is then dubbed to submasters, which are the "mothers," as their called, for each press in the plant. You press the CD's or records, put in your cover art, and that's it.

The only real difficulty comes in changing over the ownership of property I've aquired. That requires certain records and most importantly a personal appearance at the county seat in Gettysburg. But that's where you come in.

The less exposure I recieve around government buildings the better. You, as Mrs. Taupin, will attract considerably less attention than I.
There was a man once. Just a simple woodcarver. But he understood. More than anyone he could see to the heart of it. It never ends. Today is the same as the first. Tomorrow will be the same as today. So much time. And all of it wasted. You love history?
Yes.
Yes.
I wish I could.
The estate stuff is pretty straight forward. Just lots of forms and an appearance at the county seat.
It will take some time for the forms to clear before you go to Gettysburg.
No. So what now? We just wait?
Yes.
Yes.
Well, as long as we're stuck here.
It's some sort of party the town is throwing.
They do it each year.

I thought it might be a nice break from all of this.

You're using your son's name.
No. Just the child of some lonely girl I gave a ride to. When they died I put them in a grave with my name on it. Twenty years later I became the son.
Then you must be at least 70 years old.
At least.

What is it like? Being you?
Empty. And fear. Fear of those that would kill you and fear of those that would love you. It can never last, and in the end you always end up destroying both.

The emptyness. The years and years of void. Nothingness. Bordered only by the quest for ultimate nothingness. Who would have guessed?
The inheritance.

Not power. Not control.
Life. It is the gift and the under- standing of life.
You have lived forever.

Life is only life when it is bounded by death. The inheritance is death. The gift is the finality of life. To be part of the fabric. The inside. I love you Brenna.
It will be horrible. The future. I may die tomorrow or 10,000 tomorrows. I can promise you nothing. Nothing but a moment. Maybe two. But a moment of love, is that not worth a lifetime?
Yes.
Forget it.

Don't they have enough for you to do at the castle?
Forgers do it all the time. They take the birth certificate of some- one who died young and use it to get legit I.D. Usually they carry it long enough to pass some bad checks then dump it.

You've been a busy little beaver. Especially with that records mess up in Church Hill. Your notes are very complete. Naturally my feelings were crushed when you didn't rush right over and tell us what you knew. In fact, we're considering book- ing the ambulence chaser as an accessory to murder.

Then it is time two of us did. You are very young. I was once young. I can help.

Don't threaten me, Private.

Who do you think I am? One of your freckle faced children waiting to die tomorrow? "Threaten you"? You and I just living will always be a threat. Forever. Look at your life, Major. Look at mine. Nothing there but threat. Threats and nothingness. It's what we live for.
Do not turn your back on me.
You are really going to force this, aren't you?

Either you are with me or against me.
You see Major? You are not so different...
I had no choice.
Ah, Conor, how you look a man.
Have you time for some- thing to eat?
Your grandfather wore that in his service to the King, and I to fight for the Duke.

Should have seen him the first night. Son of a bitch stood there with a quart of blood on his pant leg and didn't even blink.
You'd think he'd had practice.
Are you sure?
Won't know till the records department comes back with it this after- noon. Looks good though. They found the receipt in his townhouse. It was pretty smeared but had Taupin's father listed as a signatory.

I'll never forget the look on that Papal commander's face when his "heretic stronghold" turned out to be a rock full of whores climbing all over Neuvich.
Neuvich, the clown of the crusades.

But then rides up Pope Pius who calmly brushes the dust from his papal cross, climbs off his papal horse, draws his papal sword and asks just what the hell is going on. And what did Neuvich, dear dear drunken Neuvich do?

Offered the Pope one of his whores.
Had a great swing with his blade. For a Pope.
Good times then. A man could stretch his legs without bring- ing half the world down around his ears. Not like now.
He found us even there.
He always did.
I haven't drunk this much since-

Certified and everything. Got it right here in my wallet... What? No, he's not here -- I'm in a phone booth.
All right. I've done it. Now, are you satisfied?
Fine. And here's a kiss for you.
What's the matter?
I lost my wallet.

BRUCE!! How'd you get out?
Not through any help of yours, Hildy.
Not through any help of yours, Hildy.
Bruce, I know, but I was in the biggest jam --
I waited and waited and then I had an idea and wired Albany to send me a hundred dollars so I could get out on bail... I don't know what they'll think -- they sent it to the police station!
We'll explain the whole thing to them.

Just a second, Walter. Here, Bruce, here's the check... And, oh, Bruce, here's your wallet. I got it back.
You got it back, eh? There's something funny going on around here.
I'm taking the nine o'clock train, Hildy. And you can meet us at the station.
Fine.

I've just told you I was busy with Mr. Bruce Baldwin!

I'm Bruce Baldwin!
You're Bruce Baldwin?
Yes!
Yes!
Then who are you?
This is a pleasure, Mr. Baldwin, and I'm sorry about the mistake.

Just wanted to surprise you, I guess. Down! After you, Bruce! Come on, Hildy, my treat!
Well, so you're getting married tomorrow, eh? How does it feel, Bruce?
Feels awful good. Yes, sir -- we're taking the four o'clock train to Albany and tomorrow we'll be married.

Taking the train today -- and being married tomorrow?
Mother? But your mother --
No. My mother.
No. My mother.
Oh. Your mother -- well, of course, that relieves my mind.
I know I wasn't a good husband, Hildy, but you can always count on me.
I don't think she'll need you very much -- I aim to do most of the protecting myself.
Well, I'll try to give her one.
I know you will, Bruce. Are you going to live with your mother?
I know you will, Bruce. Are you going to live with your mother?
Just for the first year.
Just for the first year.
That'll be nice. A home with mother. A real honeymoon. In Albany, too. Ow!
Mighty nice little town, Albany. They've got the State Capitol there, you know.
Yes, I know... Hildy, will you ever forget the night you brought the Governor back to your hotel room and found me taking a bath? She didn't even know I was in town...
How's business, Bruce?
Well, Albany's a mighty good insurance town. Most people there take it out pretty early in life.
Well, Albany's a mighty good insurance town. Most people there take it out pretty early in life.
I don't blame them.
I sometimes wish I'd taken out insurance -- but, of course, now it doesn't matter. Still, I suppose it would have been the smart thing to do.
Well, I honestly feel that way. I figure I'm in one line of business that really helps people. Of course, we don't help you much when you're alive -- but afterward -- that's what counts.

Anything the matter?
Just Sweeney again. One of my best reporters.
Just what is the lowdown on Williams?
It's simple. A poor little dope who lost his job went berserk and shot a cop who was coming after him to quiet him down.
Are you sure Williams is not all there?
All you've got to do is talk to him. But the Mayor would hang his own grandmother to be re-elected.

Oh -- an hour for the interview. Another hour to write it.
Oh -- an hour for the interview. Another hour to write it.
We could take the six o'clock train, Hildy. If it would save a man's life.
I never knew Hildy to be so determined before.
You haven't seen anything yet.
I don't know. This makes me feel funny.
Why shouldn't I make Hildy my beneficiary? I've got nobody else to leave it to.
Why shouldn't I make Hildy my beneficiary? I've got nobody else to leave it to.
I feel I ought to take care of her.
I feel I ought to take care of her.
Well, you'll take care of her. After all, if that doctor's right, I'm going to live for a long time yet. Look, Bruce, this is a debt of honor. I was a very bad husband: Hildy could have got a lot of alimony if she'd wanted to, but she wouldn't take any. She had it coming to her, but she was too independent.

Well, I'm independent, too.
Well, I'm independent, too.
Figure it this way: I ought to be good for twenty-five years. By that time, you'll probably have made enough so that the money won't mean anything. But suppose you haven't made good -- don't you think Hildy's entitled to a quiet old age without any worries?

Well, of course, if you put it that way.
Well, of course, if you put it that way.
And remember this, Bruce! I love her, too.
And remember this, Bruce! I love her, too.
I'm beginning to realize that.
I'm beginning to realize that.
And the beauty of it is she'll never have to know 'till I've passed on. Maybe she'll think kindly of me --- after I'm gone.
And the beauty of it is she'll never have to know 'till I've passed on. Maybe she'll think kindly of me --- after I'm gone.
Gee, you almost make me feel like a heel -- coming between you.
Gee, you almost make me feel like a heel -- coming between you.
No, Bruce, you didn't come between us. It was all over for her before you came on the scene. For me -- it'll never be over.
Well, Bruce, here you are -- certified and everything.
Certified! I'm afraid Hildy'd feel ashamed to think she hadn't trusted you.
Well, she'll know some day.
That's all I ask. Oh, wait a minute.
Don't want to forget this, you know. Might start to rain again.
Thanks. I'll phone Hildy right away to get that story.
Well, anyway, I know Hildy's getting a good man.
Thanks a lot.
Well, I got to get back. You can find your way out, can't you?
Oh, sure. Well, thanks for everything.
Oh, sure. Well, thanks for everything.
Don't thank me. I should thank you. So long.
Don't thank me. I should thank you. So long.
So long.
Hildy!
What the devil do you want? Listen, Bruce, you can't come in here now! We're busy! Where you been, Duffy? Stick around! What? What Chinese earthquake? The deuce with it... what's that?
No -- I was just talking to one of the guys at the office.
Oh. I wonder what's keeping mother? She was supposed to come down and get you.
And I'll take that certified check, too. I've decided I can handle things around here...
Come on, Hildy, we've got to keep going! Sorry, Bruce, but --
I'll see she's there, Bruce, I promise you.
If she's not there, mother and I are leaving anyhow!
I know how you feel, Bruce, but you've got to forgive her. She's only a woman, after all.
Suppose she is -- I have feelings, too! Do you know where I've been for the last couple of hours? Locked up in a police station and she didn't move to do anything about it.
Suppose she is -- I have feelings, too! Do you know where I've been for the last couple of hours? Locked up in a police station and she didn't move to do anything about it.
Ts! Ts! Ts!
Ts! Ts! Ts!
And now I don't know where my mother is. She may be lost.
And now I don't know where my mother is. She may be lost.
I'll find her, Bruce, if I have to put every detective in the city on the job. Tell you what -- go over to the Missing Persons Bureau and describe your mother. What does she look like?
I'll find her, Bruce, if I have to put every detective in the city on the job. Tell you what -- go over to the Missing Persons Bureau and describe your mother. What does she look like?
She's -- well, she's very motherly. That's about the best description I know.
She's -- well, she's very motherly. That's about the best description I know.
That's the kind of stuff they want!
Oh, Bruce, let me see that money Hildy gave you.
The money? Why?
The money? Why?
There's a lot of counterfeit big bills going around.
There's a lot of counterfeit big bills going around.
Gee! Take a look, will you?
Oh, this is all right, Bruce. I just wanted to be sure.
Say, I want to be sure, too!
Who do you think you are, breaking in here like this?
You can't bluff me, Burns. I don't care who you are or what paper you're editor of.
If you've any accusations to make, Hartman, make them in the proper manner. Otherwise, I'll have to ask you to get out.
You'll ask me to what?
You'll ask me to what?
Get out!
Get out!
Close that door. Don't let anybody in or out.
I can explain that, Hartman. When Hildy told me she wanted to interview Earl Williams I thought it might be dangerous and I gave her a gun to defend herself.
Oh, you did! Well, that's very, very interesting. This happens to be the gun that Earl Williams shot his way out with!
You're barking up the wrong tree, Hartman.
I'll give you three minutes to tell me where he is.
No? Well -- Johnson, you're under arrest. You, too, Burns.
Who's under arrest? You pimple-headed, square-toed spy -- do you realize what you're doing?
Who's under arrest? You pimple-headed, square-toed spy -- do you realize what you're doing?
I'll show you what I'm doing. Burns, you're guilty of obstructing justice and so is the Morning Post. I'm going to see that the Post is fined ten thousand dollars for this.
I'll show you what I'm doing. Burns, you're guilty of obstructing justice and so is the Morning Post. I'm going to see that the Post is fined ten thousand dollars for this.
You'll see nothing of the kind, Sheriff.
You'll see nothing of the kind, Sheriff.
We'll just start by impounding the Post property. Is that your desk?
Hartman, if you take this desk out of this building, I'll put you behind bars.
You will, eh? Well, we'll see about that. All right, boys. Take it.
You will, eh? Well, we'll see about that. All right, boys. Take it.
I'm warning you -- it'll be a Federal offense. And you'll be an accessory!
I'm warning you -- it'll be a Federal offense. And you'll be an accessory!
We'll take a chance on that, Burns. Go ahead, boys.
What about this, Burns? Kidnapping, eh?
Oh, trying to frame me, eh! I never saw this woman before in my life!
Call Duffy!
No, you don't!
No, you don't!
Do you want to get us scooped?
You're going to be in office for exactly two days more and then we're pulling your nose out of the feed bag.
Give me the District Attorney's office. I'll tell you what you'll be doing -- making brooms in the State penitentiary. Hello, D'Arrasty! This is Hartwell. Come over to my office, will you? I've just arrested a couple of important birds and I want to take their confessions.
What's this?
Get out of here, you!
Does it? You forget the power that always watches over the Morning Post.
Your luck's not with you now!
Duffy! Get Liebowitz!
All the lawyers in the world aren't going to help you!
All the lawyers in the world aren't going to help you!
This is the Morning Post you're talking to!
This is the Morning Post you're talking to!
The power of the press, huh!
That's absurd on the face of it, Mr. Burns! He's talking like a child.
Out of the mouths of babes.
Out of the mouths of babes.
He's insane or drunk or something. Why, if this unfortunate man, Williams, has really been reprieved, I personally am tickled to death. Aren't you, Pete?
Save that for the Tribune.
What did you say your name was -- Pinkus?
What do you want?
Why, I'm surprised, Mr. Burns. That's no way to talk to your wife -- even if she's no longer your wife.

Hello, Hildy!
Hello, Hildy!
Hello, Walter. Hi, Louie -- how's the slotmachine king?
How long is what?
You know what. How long since we've seen each other?
You know what. How long since we've seen each other?
Let's see. I was in Reno six weeks -- then Bermuda... Oh, about four months, I guess. Seems like yesterday to me.

No -- Mama doesn't dream about you any more, Walter. You wouldn't know the old girl now.
No -- Mama doesn't dream about you any more, Walter. You wouldn't know the old girl now.
Oh, yes I would. I'd know you any time --
You're repeating yourself! That's the speech you made the night you proposed. "-- any time -- any place -- anywhere!"
I notice you still remember it.

I'll always remember it. If I hadn't remembered it, I wouldn't have divorced you.

You know, Hildy, I sort of wish you hadn't done it.
You know, Hildy, I sort of wish you hadn't done it.
Done what?

Divorced me. It sort of makes a fellow lose faith in himself. It almost gives him a feeling he wasn't wanted.

Holy mackerel! Look, Walter, that's what divorces are for.
Holy mackerel! Look, Walter, that's what divorces are for.
Nonsense. You've got the old-fashioned idea that divorces are something that last forever -- till 'death us do part'. Why, a divorce doesn't mean anything today. It's only a few words mumbled over you by a judge. We've got something between us nothing can change.

What home?
Was it my fault? Did I know that coal mine was going to have another cave-in? I meant to be with you on our honeymoon, Hildy -- honest I did.
All I know is that instead of two weeks in Atlantic City with my bridegroom, I spent two weeks in a coal mine with John Kruptzky -- age sixty-three -- getting food and air out of a tube! You don't deny that. Do you?

I made a great reporter out of you, Hildy, but you won't be half as good on any other paper, and you know it. You need me and I need you -- and the paper needs both of us.

Sweeney! You can't do that to me! Not today, of all days! Jumping Jehosophat! Oh, no, Sweeney... Well, I suppose so... All right. If you have to, you have to. How do you like that? Everything happens to me -- with 365 days in the year -- this has to be the day.

Look at this!
I tried to tell you right away but you started reminiscing. I'm getting married, Walter, and also getting as far away from the newspaper business as I can get! I'm through.
Get married all you want to, Hildy, but you can't quit the newspaper business.

Then what does he want with you?
Now you got me.

Nothing personal. I was just asking.
You wouldn't believe this, Walter, but Bruce holds the door open for me.
No kidding?
And he takes his hat off when he's with a lady.
What for?

And when he walks with a lady, he waits for her!

I suppose I can't call this off without creating a scene -- but remember, it's your last fling.
How do you like that? Here I am being nice to you and your sweet-heart and that's the thanks I get!
Well, I'll tell you one thing, old man, she never looked at me the way she's looking at you.
I might have, Walter, but you were never there.
I might have, Walter, but you were never there.
Anyway, I'm glad you two are going to be happy and have all the things I couldn't give her. You know, Hildy is about the best reporter in the country -- and that goes regardless of sex. But all she really ever wanted was a home.
Here's luck to the bride and bridegroom.
Thank you.
What now?
His wife had twins and he went out to celebrate and got as drunk as a lord. They can't even find him. I tell you, drink is the ruin of this nation.

So -- Sweeney gets twins -- and Earl Williams gets hanged tomorrow.
If he's nuts, why doesn't the State just put him away?
Because it happened to be a colored policeman.

No, Bruce, dear. Don't you see? This is a trick to get your sympathy. No, Walter, I've been waiting for something like this -- but I wasn't sure when you'd spring it. If you want to save Earl Williams' life, you can interview him yourself. You're still a good reporter. Bruce and I will be on that four o'clock train -- and thanks just

Why, Walter, you're getting poetic!
You see what I had to put up with? She never trusted me! You argue with her -- otherwise you're going on a honeymoon with blood on your hands!
How can you have any happiness after that? All through the years you'll remember that a man went to the gallows because you were too selfish to wait two hours! I tell you, Earl Williams' face will come between you on the train tonight -- and at the preacher's tomorrow -- and all the rest of your lives!
What a performance! Bravo! Don't let him fool you, Bruce -- it's only an act!

Maybe you'll be. You're a smart young man. You let Hildy do this story for me and you can write out a $100,000.00 insurance policy for me. What do you say?
Now you're talking!
You keep out of this. Bruce, suppose you examine Mr. Burns in his office. I'll get my bag and go over to the Press Room in the Criminal Courts Building. You phone me as soon as Mr. Burns has given you his check. Then I'll go get the interview and you phone Mother that we're taking the six o'clock train. And no tricks, Walter!

What tricks would I pull?
What tricks would I pull?
Oh, nothing! Of course, you might cancel the check. Yes! Wait a minute! What would be his first payment on that policy?
What do you think I am -- a crook?
Yes --- and that's putting it mildly! No certified check -- no story -- Get me?
Yes --- and that's putting it mildly! No certified check -- no story -- Get me?
All right. The check will be certified. Want my fingerprints?
All right. The check will be certified. Want my fingerprints?
No thanks, I've still got those. Well, I'll step into some working clothes and hop over to the Press Room for the background on this yarn. It'll be kind of fun to see the boys again, too. Remember, Bruce, it must be certified.
Exclusive? That's great.
It cost me four hundred and fifty bucks to tear it out of Cooley.

Never mind that. What's the story?

Never mind it? That's not my money! That's Bruce's money!
Never mind it? That's not my money! That's Bruce's money!
You'll get it. Now what's the story? I'll have the paper send the money right down to you. I swear it on my mother's grave.

Wait a minute. Your mother's alive.

I meant on my grandmother's grave. Don't be so technical, Hildy. What's the story?!
I meant on my grandmother's grave. Don't be so technical, Hildy. What's the story?!
Well, this expert Dr. Egelhoffer, from New York, decides to make Williams re-enact the crime --
Well, I'm coming to it. It seems the Professor had to have a gun to re- enact the crime with -- and who do you suppose supplied it? Nobody else but that great thinker, Sheriff Hartman!
No kidding, Hildy. Say, this isn't a rib?
No kidding, Hildy. Say, this isn't a rib?
No, this is on the level, Walter. I'm not good enough to make this one up. The Sheriff gave his gun to the Professor, the Professor gave it to Earl, and Earl gave it right back to the Professor -- right in the stomach! Who? No, Egelhoffer wasn't hurt badly. They took him to the County Hospital where they're afraid he'll recover.

That's great work, Hildy... Huh? Oh, will you stop worrying about the money? I'll see you get it in fifteen minutes.

It better be fifteen minutes, because Bruce is waiting downstairs in a taxicab and that meter's clicking away to beat the band.

Hold on a minute.
Walter! D-did you see -- -- that?
Yes. Where is he?
Yes. Where is he?
She jumped out of the window.
She jumped out of the window.
I know. Where is he, I said.
Where do you think you're going?
Let go o' me! I've got to get Bruce out of jail! Oh, Walter, why did you have to do this to me?
Let go o' me! I've got to get Bruce out of jail! Oh, Walter, why did you have to do this to me?
Get Bruce out of jail! How can you worry about a man who's resting comfortably in a quiet police station while this is going on? Hildy, this is war! You can't desert now!

Oh, get off that trapeze! There's your story! Smear it all over the front page -- Earl Williams caught by the Morning Post! And take all the credit -- I covered your story for you and I got myself in a fine mess doing it -- and now I'm getting out! I know I told you that twice before today -- but this time

You drooling idiot! What do you mean, you're getting out! There are three hundred and sixty-five days in the year one can get married -- but how many times have you got a murderer locked up in a desk? -- Once in a lifetime! Hildy, you've got the whole city by the seat of the pants!

Wait a minute -- wasn't it Stanley who discovered Livingstone?
Don't get technical at a time like this! Do you realize what you've done? You've taken a city that's been graft-ridden for forty years under the same old gang and with this yarn you're kicking 'em out and giving us a chance to have the same kind of government that New York's having under La Guardia! We'll make such monkeys out of these ward-heelers

I'd like to think.
I'd like to think.
Well, think it then, because it's true! We'll crucify that mob. We're going to keep Williams under cover till morning so the Post can break the story exclusive. Then we'll let the Governor in on the capture -- share the glory with him.

I get it!
You've kicked over the whole City Hall like an apple-cart. You've got the Mayor and Hartman backed against a wall. You've put one administration out and another in. This isn't a newspaper story -- it's a career! And you stand there belly-aching about whether you catch an eight o'clock train or a nine o'clock train! Still a doll-faced mugg! That's all you are.

Not if he's inside the desk. We'll carry the desk over. Give me Duffy!
You can't take that desk out. It's crawling with cops outside.
You can't take that desk out. It's crawling with cops outside.

Where's some paper?
Can I call the Mayor a bird of prey -- or is that libelous?
Call him a love-child, if you want to. Duffy!
How about the time he had his house painted by the Fire Department?
Give him the works. Hello, Duffy, get set! We've got the biggest story in the world. Earl Williams caught by the Morning Post -- exclusive!
For Pete's sake, Hildy, they're waiting for the rest of that story!
Okay, Walter.
Hildy!
All right, Walter.
Listen, did you impress it on Butch that I want him and his gang here right away? You did? Every minute counts. All right. Duffy's getting old!
Where's Butch?
Well, keep going! We want an extra out on the streets before it's too late!
Where's Bruce?

Is he coming back here?
Is he coming back here?
Didn't you hear him? Of course he's coming back here. Keep going, will you?
Double-crossing swine!
You said it! But this'll teach him a lesson. He won't quit his paper without giving notice after this.
Tear into it, will you? Don't sit there like a frozen robin!
I'm finished.
I'm finished.
Finished!
Bruce ought to be back by now. Walter, you're not trying anything again, are you?
Hildy, you think I could? After this story? Here! You're just nervous.
Where's Mrs. Baldwin?
What did you do with her?
What did you do with her?
What happened?
What happened?
You been in a fight?
Where is she? Tell me!
Louie!
Don't tell me -- was she killed?
Was she? Did you notice?
It's Fate, Hildy. What will be, will be.
What am I going to say to Bruce? What'll I tell him?
What am I going to say to Bruce? What'll I tell him?
If he really loves you, you won't have to tell him anything. Snap out of it! Would you rather have had the old dame dragging the whole police force in here?
If he really loves you, you won't have to tell him anything. Snap out of it! Would you rather have had the old dame dragging the whole police force in here?
I killed her. I'm responsible. Oh- h... what can I do now? How can I ever face him? Oh, I hope he never comes back!
Look at me, Hildy --
I'm looking at you -- you murderer!
I'm looking at you -- you murderer!
If it was my own mother, I'd carry on! You know I would. For the paper!

When I'm surrounded, with my back against the wall, you're not going to lay down on me, are you --
Yes.
Hildy, you just can't leave me out on a limb now. It -- it wouldn't be cricket!
I don't care what you say. I'm going to find Bruce's mother. Oh-h... I'm going out and find her!
Don't open that!
Who says so? I'm going to the morgue -- to look --
No, you don't! Walter!
What is it? Here!
No!
Yes! What are you afraid of Hildy? I dare him to move that desk out of here.
Wait a minute! Let go there!
Murder, uh?
Murder, uh?
Hanging an innocent man to win an election!
When did you deliver this first?
Who did you talk to?
Which ought to be about three hours more, I'd say.
Just until we can get out a special edition asking for your impeachment.
Just until we can get out a special edition asking for your impeachment.
And your arrest. You'll each get about ten years, I think.
How was that for a tight squeeze?
Don't tell me you were worried!

Worried! I was petrified. Weren't you?

Don't remind me. That's how we happened to --
Sorry, Hildy. I didn't mean to be making love to another man's fiancee.
That's all right, Walter. It's as much my fault as yours.
That's all right, Walter. It's as much my fault as yours.

All right. Heads I go -- tails I stay to write the story. Ready?
Well -- what is it?
What's the difference? I'm going to write that story -- and you know it!
Hildy!
Don't touch me! I'm not doing it for you!
Don't touch me! I'm not doing it for you!
Then why are you doing it?
Then why are you doing it?
Because I'm a newspaper woman, Heaven help me!
The greatest yarn ever written by anybody. My hat's off to you, Hildy!
Thanks.
Thanks.
And what a way to quit. While you're still champion! That's the way to leave, Hildy!

On the nine o'clock train. That's the one he took, isn't it?
On the nine o'clock train. That's the one he took, isn't it?
Sure.
Sure.
It's awfully clear now. Bruce needs a wife who can give him a home -- and affection -- and peace. I couldn't do that for him, Walter. I'm what you made me -- a cheap reporter who'd give up her soul for a story!... Is that job still open?

Thanks, Walter, but it's no good. We tried it.
Thanks, Walter, but it's no good. We tried it.
Sure, it was good -- it was wonderful! Only you expected it to be like other marriages. It can't be like other marriages -- we're different! We're a different world. Look at what we went through today. I wouldn't trade that for any honeymoon in the world. I bet you wouldn't, either.

Well, I'd like to be lady-like and think it over.
Well, I'd like to be lady-like and think it over.
I don't want to rush you. Take a couple of seconds.
What!
Now don't argue, Hildy. How about it, Judge?
That's what he said the last time. Don't believe him, Judge.
Hildy, from this time on no tricks, no double-crossing -- everything on the level!
Hildy, from this time on no tricks, no double-crossing -- everything on the level!
You're not fooling anybody.
How about Bruce's?
Walter, you can't do that!
Walter, you can't do that!
Sure, I can. Look at the policy I gave him! "With this ring I thee wed and with all my worldly goods I thee endow: And thereto I plight thee my troth."
Hildy, darling!
Yes -- 'Hildy, darling'. I'm just a fool. That's what I am. I know what it's going to be like.
Yes -- 'Hildy, darling'. I'm just a fool. That's what I am. I know what it's going to be like.
It'll be Heaven!
It'll be Heaven!
Sure, Heaven! You've probably thought up another coal mine to send me down in -- to get a new story for your paper!
But, Hildy -- I can explain --
You -- you!!
Louie, take this lady over to Polack Mike's and lock her up. See that she doesn't take to anyone on the way.
What's that -- what's that?
Are you referring to me, Madam?
You know you did!
Come on, Sheriff. We've got to get bail.
I was in here -- and they had some kind of murderer in with them. They were hiding him!
Oh, dear! Oh, dear!
You grey-haired old Judas!
You grey-haired old Judas!
Let me out! Let me out of here!
Down Western Avenue. We were going sixty-five miles an hour. You know what I mean?
Take that mush out of your mouth!
Butter-fingers! I give you an old lady to take somewhere, and you hand her over to the cops!
What do you mean, I handed her? The patrol wagon was on the wrong side of the street.

Now everything's fine. She's probably squawking her head off in some police station.
Now everything's fine. She's probably squawking her head off in some police station.
I don't think she's talking much... You know what I mean?
You stay here. I'll find out everything.

Beat it out and get hold of some guys.

Anybody with hair on his chest. Get 'em off the street -- anywhere. Offer them anything -- only get them. We've got to get this desk out of here.
You know me. The shirt off my back.

He's on my phone. He just called me.
He's on my phone. He just called me.
They can't do that to me!
Don't blame me. I'm City Editor in name only. You do all the hiring around here.
Yeah! Well, I do the firing, too. Remember that, Duffy, and Keep a civil tongue in your head.
Here's that certified check, Walter. I drew out my wife's savings, and if this isn't back by 5:30 I'm a ruined man!
Don't worry, Duffy, you'll have it back by five. Thanks, Duffy. Stick around.
Hello, Hildy! What are you doing around here?
I want to interview Earl Williams, Warden. How about a little service?
I want to interview Earl Williams, Warden. How about a little service?
No more interviews. Besides, a doctor's coming over.
Say, isn't this your twenty dollars?
I think it is.
I think it is.
I thought so. Come on, I'm in a hurry.
Cooley, I want to talk to you.
Hildy -- I can't. I'm busy -- I -- Let me up, Hildy. Earl Williams has escaped --
There's money in it, Cooley.
I can't Hildy. It means my job! It means --
I can't Hildy. It means my job! It means --
A lot of money. Four hundred and fifty dollars --
How much?
Four hundred and fifty dollars. Is it a deal?
Four hundred and fifty dollars. Is it a deal?
It's a deal. Let me up.
Let's see the money.
First we talk. How did Earl Williams get that gun?
The newspapers! Sheriff, they're the scum of modern civilization.
You said it!
You said it!
They're always after me for interviews.
They're always after me for interviews.
Me, too.
Me, too.
Of course, I sort of promised them I would give out a statement when I got through here. You don't mind?
Of course, I sort of promised them I would give out a statement when I got through here. You don't mind?
Well, I don't know if that's ethical. You see, all statements are supposed to come from me.
Well, I don't know if that's ethical. You see, all statements are supposed to come from me.
We'll have to satisfy them. What would you say to giving them a joint interview? I could give them some of the psychological aspects of the case and you could give them the legal aspects.
We'll have to satisfy them. What would you say to giving them a joint interview? I could give them some of the psychological aspects of the case and you could give them the legal aspects.
A joint interview, eh? That might be all right. We could have our pictures taken together, Doctor.
A joint interview, eh? That might be all right. We could have our pictures taken together, Doctor.
Yes, shaking hands. I don't take a very good picture, though.
Yes, shaking hands. I don't take a very good picture, though.
It doesn't matter. The publicity's the main thing.
It doesn't matter. The publicity's the main thing.
Yes, I suppose so. It all helps.
I don't know --
Come, come, Sheriff, lightning doesn't strike in the same place twice. Nothing's going to happen.
Are you gentlemen all through with me?
Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you were here. No, Mr. Williams, we still have some questions for you. Sheriff, will you kindly extinguish the lights?
You know you are to be executed, Mr. Williams. Who do you feel is responsible for that?
The system. But I'm not afraid to die, Doctor. I'm dying for what I believe.
The system. But I'm not afraid to die, Doctor. I'm dying for what I believe.
I see. You realize, however, that you committed a crime?
I see. You realize, however, that you committed a crime?
In a legal sense, yes. But not actually. Actually, I'm innocent. I didn't do anything.
Now, the Sheriff will be Mollie Malloy, in whose room you were. You will be Earl Williams. And I will be the policeman. Follow me, Mr. Williams?
Yes, sir.
So -- now I say to you: 'Earl Williams, you are under arrest!' and you point your gun at me.
Well, it wasn't exactly that way --
Well, it wasn't exactly that way --
Point the gun at me!
Well, that about covers everything.
Good. Now I want to ask you fellows a couple of questions. Did Earl Williams know what he was doing when he fired that gun?
Say, that's old Prissy Bensinger's desk.
I know, I just want to give him a thrill.
I call. What you got?
Three bullets! Any good?
Three bullets! Any good?
Beats king up.
Who locked the door?
Just a second, Mike --- Mollie, I got it!
Open up there, will you!
All right -- all right!
Hey!
Mollie, drop down here! You've fainted!
Kind of exclusive, ain't you? We got calls to make, you know.
Run down and get some smelling salts, will you?
Mollie Malloy -- what happened to her?
Came up here -- had hysterics and passed out. I've been trying to get her to come to.
She looks as though she's going to come to.
Give me a hand with her, will you?
Give me a hand with her, will you?
Okay. Up you go, Mollie.
A fine bunch of reporters. Biggest story in two years and they're too lazy to go after it.
It's easy for you to talk. You're retired. We're still working.
Better let us in on it, Mollie.
Aw, why don't you let her alone? She's ill!
That must be the tenth alienist they've had on Williams. Even if he wasn't crazy before, he would be after ten of those babies got through psychoanalyzing him. Gimme the desk.
This Egelhoffer's pretty good.
This Egelhoffer's pretty good.
Yeah? What did he ever do for his country?
Yeah? What did he ever do for his country?
Don't you remember? He's the guy went to Washington to interview the Brain Trust, and gave out a statement that they were all sane. It created a sensation!
Trouble is, when the Red Menace shows up the Sheriff will still be crying 'Wolf!'
What have you got, Hildy?
Well, a guy can win when Hildy ain't around.
Who's this guy she's gonna marry?
She says she's gonna write fiction.
Well, if she's gonna write fiction, there's nothing like being a reporter.
You guys wanna play some more poker?
What's the use? I can't win a pot.
Boy, did you see her go?
Lioness Rushes to Defense of Cub.
No, I tell you! Nobody knows where he got it.
The Crime Commission has offered a reward of ten thousand dollars for Williams' capture.
The Crime Commission has offered a reward of ten thousand dollars for Williams' capture.
Call you back.
So have we!
What's the dope, Sheriff?
What's the dope, Sheriff?
Who engineered this getaway?
Say, Hildy, if I know you, you sound pretty anxious to get rid of us. Are you trying to scoop us or something?
Something smells around here. If you ask me Mollie gave her the story on how Williams got that gun. Did you smuggle that gun into Williams, Mollie?
Oh, you two are pals now -- I think you're right, Endicott. Mollie did give her some kind of story.
I tell you, it's a screwy set-up. We better hold onto 'em both.
Come on, you! Before we slap you down.
Do you want us to call the cops and have them give you the boots?
Do you want us to call the cops and have them give you the boots?
Where is he, before we beat it out of you?
Come on, Pinky! Give 'em a little third degree.
Make them talk and you got Williams, Pinky!
Hold the phone!
I'll have it in a minute.
I'll call.
Three sixes. Is that any good?
Goodbye, Yonson.
So long, Hildy.
What a chase!
No luck on Williams, yet -- call you back.
You ain't gettin' out o' here!
Now, where is he?
We know what you're up to.
Probably goin' out to get Williams.
How's everything, Gus?
I can't complain.
Oh -- I'll take the same, I guess. And coffee.
Little rum in yours, too?
Little rum in yours, too?
I guess so.
No -- just coffee, Gus.
Just coffee. And you, sir?
Oh, I'm sorry, Gus! My foot must have slipped.
That's all right.
Gus, this --
Good coffee, isn't it?
Same way you did. Through that gate.
I gave strict orders that nobody was to interview Williams without my permission.
I gave strict orders that nobody was to interview Williams without my permission.
All right, then, I'll just run the story that Sheriff Hartman is afraid to let reporters interview his prisoner. Of course, with election coming, that might do you a lot of harm, but just as you say.
All right, then, I'll just run the story that Sheriff Hartman is afraid to let reporters interview his prisoner. Of course, with election coming, that might do you a lot of harm, but just as you say.
Now, wait a minute! I'm not afraid of anything. What were you going to write about Williams?
Now, wait a minute! I'm not afraid of anything. What were you going to write about Williams?
Oh, nothing much. Just that the state had proved he was sane -- and he admits it himself. If you don't want me to run it --
Oh, nothing much. Just that the state had proved he was sane -- and he admits it himself. If you don't want me to run it --
Oh, that'll be all right, Hildy. Go ahead, run it. And you can say I treated him well, too. 'Lo, Earl. How are you feeling?
No, thanks Sheriff. I'm leaving town tonight.
You ought to stay over. You always wrote a good hanging story, Hildy.
You ought to stay over. You always wrote a good hanging story, Hildy.
That's awful kind of you, Sheriff. I've got to get started on my interview. See you later.
Just a minute, Johnson!
Let go o' me. What's the idea?
Take your paws off me!
Hold her, boys!
Let me go! Fellows, something's happened to my mother-in-law.
Hang onto her! Keep her in here!
I don't know anything, I tell you. There's been an accident.
Johnson, there's something very peculiar going on.

You can send somebody with me if you don't believe me!

I wasn't born yesterday. Now the boys tell me you and this Mollie Malloy --
I wasn't born yesterday. Now the boys tell me you and this Mollie Malloy --
Nobody's trying to put anything over on you. I'm getting out of here and you can't stop me!
Johnson, I'm going to the bottom of this. What do you know about Williams? Are you going to talk or aren't you?
What do I know about Williams?
What do I know about Williams?
All right, boys. Take her along. I got ways of making her talk.
Where'd you get this?
I've got a right to carry a gun if I want to.
I've got a right to carry a gun if I want to.
Not this gun!
He went over to the hospital to call on Professor Egelhoffer.
What?
What?
With a bag of marshmallows.
He's harmless.
Don't take any chances. Shoot through the desk.
Don't take any chances. Shoot through the desk.
He can't hurt anybody. You've got his gun.
That's murder!
All right! Carl! Frank! One of you get on each side of the desk. Take hold of the cover.
If the Mayor wants me, he knows where I am.

Howard Shenken, the Sheriff's uncle on his mother's side --
Where is he?
Where he used to live. You can catch the Riot Squad -- it's just going out.
I'm Sheriff Hartman. You want me?
You're certainly a hard fellow to find, Sheriff.
For who?
Earl Williams. The reprieve.
Read it! Insane, he says. He knows very well that Williams ain't insane!
Yeah. But I --
Well, wait a minute, will you? I'm in conference.
No, I couldn't do that.
Just one second --
That's good, because my health ain't what it used to be.
Pete, I want to talk to you!
I ain't got time, Fred, honest. I'll see you after.
I ain't got time, Fred, honest. I'll see you after.
Did you actually give Williams that gun?

Pete, I've got a mighty unpleasant task to perf --
Now, listen, Fred. Just give me a few hours before you make any decisions. I'll get results. I'm doing everything humanly possible. I've just sworn in four hundred deputies.
Four hundred! Do you want to bankrupt this administration?

I'm getting them for twelve dollars a night.

If you're talking about my brother- in-law, he's worked for the city fifteen years.
Pete, you're through!
What do you mean -- through?
What do you mean -- through?
I mean I'm scratching your name off the ticket Tuesday and running Czernecki in your place. It's nothing personal. And, Pete -- it's the only way out. It's a sacrifice we all ought to be glad to make.

Now, Pete! Please don't appeal to my Sentimental side.

I wish you wouldn't talk like that, Pete.

Our families, Fred. I've always looked on Bessie as my own sister.
Our families, Fred. I've always looked on Bessie as my own sister.
If there was any way out...
That gives you an idea of what I'm up against!
We're up against a lot more than that with that nutty slogan you invented: 'Reform the Reds With a Rope'.
Williams ain't a Red, and you know it!
Well, there's a lot of Communistic sympathizers around --
Well, there's a lot of Communistic sympathizers around --
I know it! But they've got nothing to do with this case! Do you realize there are two hundred thousand votes at stake and unless we hang Earl Williams we're going to lose 'em?
I know it! But they've got nothing to do with this case! Do you realize there are two hundred thousand votes at stake and unless we hang Earl Williams we're going to lose 'em?
But we're going to hang him, Fred. He can't get away.
The Governor gave me his word of honor he wouldn't interfere. Two days ago!
And you fell for it, Pete. It frightens me what I'd like to do to you. Who else knows about this?
Pure politics!
An attempt to ruin us!
Dementia praecox Oh-h-h!
We got to think fast before those lying reporters get hold of this. What'll we tell 'em?

Cover up that transmitter!
No -- don't out me off.
How would you like to have a job for three hundred and fifty dollars a month. That's almost a hundred dollars a week!
Hold your horses -- will you, Olsen? Hurry up, Fred!
Now what do you say?
We'll fix that, too.
Just -- one -- second!
All right. Tell 'em to shoot to kill.
What?
What?
Shoot to kill, I said.
Shoot to kill, I said.
I don't know, Fred. There's that reprieve if they ever find out.

Hello, Olsen... Listen... Shoot to kill... That's the orders pass the word along... No! We dont want him! And listen, Olsen, five- hundred bucks for the guy that does the job... Yes, I'll be right out there. Well, I hope that's the right thing to do.

If we didn't have election Tuesday I'd have this on my conscience.
Fine work, Pete! You certainly delivered the goods. I'm proud of you.
Look kind o' natural, don't they, Fred?

A sight for sore eyes!

Aiding an escaped criminal! And a little charge of kidnapping I'm looking into. But that's the jail! There must be somebody there!
Aiding an escaped criminal! And a little charge of kidnapping I'm looking into. But that's the jail! There must be somebody there!
Well! Looks like about ten years apiece for you birds!
Who is this man?
Throw him out, Frank.
You drunken idiot! Arrest him! The idea of coming here with a cock-and- bull story like that!
It's a frame-up! Some imposter!
That's a lie!!
I never saw him before!
Take those handcuffs off our friends, Pete. That wasn't at all necessary.
I was just going to!
Walter, I can't tell you how badly I feel about this. There was no excuse for Hartwell to fly off the handle.
I was only doing my duty. Nothing personal in it.
And so do I!
So do you what, you hoodoo! And now, Mr. Pinkus, if you'll come with us, we'll take you over to the Warden's office and deliver this reprieve.
Fine, thanks, Sheriff.
That's good, Earl. Oh, they've got another alienist to see you. He ought to be here any minute. Don't go to sleep, will you?
That's good, Earl. Oh, they've got another alienist to see you. He ought to be here any minute. Don't go to sleep, will you?
I won't.
I won't.
Hildy, how'd you like a couple of tickets for the hanging?
I hope you're pretty nearly through with me, Doctor, I'm getting a little fatigued.
Yeah, you don't want to tire him out, Doctor.
Got you, Williams!
Go on -- shoot me!
Let him out of here, Lieutenant.
But, Hildy, I can't. He's accused of stealing a watch. And they found the watch on him.
But, Hildy, I can't. He's accused of stealing a watch. And they found the watch on him.
And who accused him? Diamond Louis! One of the worst crooks in town! Why don't you arrest Louis instead of innocent people that he frames?
And who accused him? Diamond Louis! One of the worst crooks in town! Why don't you arrest Louis instead of innocent people that he frames?
Now, Hildy --
Now, Hildy --
Don't Hildy me! Are you going to let him out?
Don't Hildy me! Are you going to let him out?
I can't.
I can't.
All right. You can't. But tomorrow the Post will run the story of that roulette game on 43rd Street that your brother-in-law runs. And we'll print that you get five hundred a month for forgetting about it!
All right. You can't. But tomorrow the Post will run the story of that roulette game on 43rd Street that your brother-in-law runs. And we'll print that you get five hundred a month for forgetting about it!
Now, Hildy, don't be hasty! I can't let him out.
Now, Hildy, don't be hasty! I can't let him out.
You can let him out on bail, can't you?
You can let him out on bail, can't you?
Five hundred dollars.
Five hundred dollars.
You'll take fifty and like it!
You'll take fifty and like it!
Well, all right. But I'm liable to get into a jam.
Oh, I ain't doing that any more. I'm retired. I'm one of you fellas now -- a newspaper man.
Editorials?
Wait a minute, Walter. You can't do that!
My name is Louis Peluso.
Where's the old lady?
I'm telling you!
We run smack into a police patrol. You know what I mean? We broke it in half!
Oh-h-h... was she hurt?
I'm telling you. Can you imagine bumping into a load of cops?! They come rollin' out like oranges!
What did you do with her?
What did you do with her?
Search me! When I come to I was running down Thirty-fifth Street.
Search me! When I come to I was running down Thirty-fifth Street.
-- You were with her. You were in the cab, weren't you?
-- You were with her. You were in the cab, weren't you?
Was I? The driver got knocked cold.
Nobody's going to rush me into anything! You keep away from me!
All right, Judge.
Gentlemen of the Press! Always picking on somebody who can't defend himself -- the littler the better.
Phone for you, Hildy.
Phone for you, Hildy.
Who is it?
Who is it?
Oh, some insurance man. Are you in?
Oh, some insurance man. Are you in?
Give me that!
There goes another scrub lady.
I'll go right after it.
Well, anyhow, I won't be covering stuff like this any more.
What's the matter? Getting yellow?
It's getting so a girl can't step out of the room without being discussed by a bunch of old ladies. Hello, Post... Mr. Walter Burns, please.
Well, Hildy, we were only saying that a swell reporter like you wouldn't give this up so easily.
Well, Hildy, we were only saying that a swell reporter like you wouldn't give this up so easily.
This is Hildy Johnson... Oh, I can give it up all right. Without a single quiver. I'm going to live like a human being -- not like you rats. Oh, is that you, Walter dear? Oh, I didn't mean "dear." That was just habit, I guess. Oh, be yourself, Walter. I've got some news for you... Yes, I got the interview, but I've got
Hello, Mr. Burns. Yes, she's still here.
I'll take it. What's the matter, Mr. Burns -- don't you understand English? -- Why, your language is shocking, Mr. Burns -- positively shocking! I don't mind because I was married to you and know what to expect, but suppose Central is listening in... Oh, did you hear that, Central? We ought to report him, don't you think?... Oh, fooey on you!
Any news?
Yeah. I was never so tired in my life.
You fight it cut.
And up a dime.
I don't know why you boys are so good to me.
Your poker's improved a lot, Hildy. Lend me two bucks, will you?
Your poker's improved a lot, Hildy. Lend me two bucks, will you?
Nothing doing. I'm playing for keeps.
Certified, eh? Who is it -- your milkman?
But, Bruce, don't keep it in your wallet!... Well, you see -- -- there's an old newspaper superstition that the first big check you get you -- you put in the lining of your hat. That brings you good luck for ten years.
But, Bruce, don't keep it in your wallet!... Well, you see -- -- there's an old newspaper superstition that the first big check you get you -- you put in the lining of your hat. That brings you good luck for ten years.
Say, I've been a reporter twenty years and never heard any hooey like that. Where'd you get it?
Say, I've been a reporter twenty years and never heard any hooey like that. Where'd you get it?
I made it up just now, and who's asking you? I know it's silly, honey, but do it for me, won't you?... Yes, right now.
Hello, Hildy. I thought you were gone.
I thought so, too.
Did you get that, Hildy?
No -- what?
If Walter Burns calls, hold the wire for me, will you? I'll be right back.
Okay, Hildy. Well, we can't get any official statement --
Okay. Forget it.
What's the matter with you boys? Afraid it might rain? If you want to go, I'll cover this end.
Look out, you --
What's the use of fighting, Hildy?
Have you got my dough?
Oh, sure. The boss sent me over with it. Four hundred dollars, wasn't it?
Oh, sure. The boss sent me over with it. Four hundred dollars, wasn't it?
Four hundred and fifty and I'll cut your throat if you try any tricks!

First you got to sign a receipt.

Thanks. So long, Hildy!
Thanks. So long, Hildy!
So long, nothing! Where's Bruce Baldwin's wallet?
So long, nothing! Where's Bruce Baldwin's wallet?
Huh?
Huh?
None of that innocent stuff, you double-crossing hyena! You stuck Bruce Baldwin in jail this afternoon on a phony charge that he swiped your watch, and you frisked his wallet! Now, give me that wallet or I'll stick you in jail and it won't be on any phony charge either! It'll be for life!

Now don't get excited, Hildy! I don't know what you're talking about -- but is this Mr. Baldwin's wallet?
You know it is!
I didn't frisk him. He must have dropped it in Burns' office. I didn't know whose it was.
I didn't frisk him. He must have dropped it in Burns' office. I didn't know whose it was.
No -- and you don't know that your cheap boss has had Mr. Baldwin arrested again -- do you?
No -- and you don't know that your cheap boss has had Mr. Baldwin arrested again -- do you?
What -- already? Why, the dame left only a minute before I did!
Kings and sixes.
That's good.
That's good.
'Kings and sixes The pot affixes'... Poetry. I learned that at my grandma's knee.
Any dope yet on how he got out?
From all I can get the Sheriff let him out so's he could vote for him.
Hildy, I thought you were gone --
Well -- I was going, but Mollie fainted away and I thought I ought to do what I could.
Well -- I was going, but Mollie fainted away and I thought I ought to do what I could.
Some Hallowe'en goin' on outside. The whole police force standing on it's ear.
Hiding him where?
Mother!
Mother!
Don't you mother me! Playing cat-and- mouse with my poor boy! Keeping him looked up -- making us miss two trains -- and supposed to be married tomorrow!
Don't you mother me! Playing cat-and- mouse with my poor boy! Keeping him looked up -- making us miss two trains -- and supposed to be married tomorrow!
Mother, I can explain everything. I'll go with you in five minutes and --
Mother, I can explain everything. I'll go with you in five minutes and --
You don't have to go with me at all! Just give me my son's money and you can stay here forever as far as I'm concerned. Stay with that murderer you caught!
I don't know what she's talking about. I never said any such thing.
I'm quoting my son, and he has never lied to me.
Mother!
That man there!
That man there!
Mother! Oh, I'm so glad to see you! Are you all right? Tell me.
I couldn't plead insanity, because you see I'm just as sane as anybody else.
You didn't mean to kill that policeman?
You didn't mean to kill that policeman?
Of course not. I couldn't kill anybody -- it's against everything I've ever stood for. They know it was an accident. They're not hanging me for that -- they're hanging me for my beliefs.
Of course not. I couldn't kill anybody -- it's against everything I've ever stood for. They know it was an accident. They're not hanging me for that -- they're hanging me for my beliefs.
What are your beliefs, Earl?
What are your beliefs, Earl?
They're very simple. I believe in the Golden Rule. I'm not the first man to die for preaching it. But if they would only listen to it -- we could have a fine, decent world instead of this mass of hate that makes man do such cruel things.

How would you go about applying the Golden Rule, Earl?

I'd do away with the profit system and have production for use only. There's enough food and clothing and shelter for everybody if we'd use some sense.

"Production for use only." Well, maybe that's the answer.
"Production for use only." Well, maybe that's the answer.
It's the only answer. Everything has a use and if we let it be used for its purpose, we could solve all our problems. Food was meant to be eaten, not stored away in restaurants while poor people starved; clothing was meant to be worn, not piled up in stores while people went naked. Doesn't that make sense?

Yes, that makes a lot of sense, Earl.
A gun? Why -- to shoot, of course.
Is that how you came to shoot the policeman?
Is that how you came to shoot the policeman?
Sure. You see, I'd never had a gun in my hand before and I didn't know what to do with it. Well, when I get stuck, I know that there's an answer for everything in production for use. So it came to me in a flash: what's a gun for? To shoot! So I shot. Simple isn't it?

Very simple, Earl.
Very simple, Earl.
There's nothing crazy about that, is there?
There's nothing crazy about that, is there?
No, Earl, not at all. Who sent you the flowers, Earl?
No, Earl, not at all. Who sent you the flowers, Earl?
Miss Mollie Malloy. She's a wonderful person.
Miss Mollie Malloy. She's a wonderful person.
Isn't that her picture?
Isn't that her picture?
Yes. Isn't she beautiful?
Don't forget about production for use.
I won't, Earl.
You're not going to phone anybody where I am.
Put down that gun, Earl.
You're not going to shoot me, Earl. I'm your friend, remember? I've got to write that story about your "Production for Use".
Yes -- that's right. Production for use.
Earl, you don't want to hurt your friends, do you?
Don't move!
Maybe you're my friend and maybe you're not -- but don't come any nearer. You can't trust anybody in this crazy world. Say, I'll bet I could shoot you from here.
Sure you could, Earl -- but you wouldn't want to do that, would you? You wouldn't want to kill anybody.
Sure you could, Earl -- but you wouldn't want to do that, would you? You wouldn't want to kill anybody.
No, no, you're right. I don't want to kill anybody. All I want to do is be let alone.
Earl, there's just one thing I ought to clear up for the interview.
What's that? Only -- you're getting too near. I don't trust anybody.
What's that? Only -- you're getting too near. I don't trust anybody.
I don't blame you, Earl. If I were in your place I wouldn't trust anybody, either.
I don't blame you, Earl. If I were in your place I wouldn't trust anybody, either.
Keep away!
Earl, you must never do that again.
Oh, I'm awful tired. I couldn't go through another day like this.
Oh, I'm awful tired. I couldn't go through another day like this.
Well, maybe you think I could!
Don't talk too loud.
Wakin' me up in the middle of the night -- talkin' to me about things they don't understand. Callin' me a Bolshevik. I'm an anarchist. It's got nothin' to do with bombs. It's the philosophy that guarantees every man freedom. You see that, don't you?

Sure I do, Earl.
Quiet, Mollie, quiet!
Don't cry, Mollie, there's nothing to cry about.
Don't cry, Mollie, there's nothing to cry about.
How'd you get here, Earl?
How'd you get here, Earl?
Down the drainpipe. I didn't mean to shoot him. You believe me, don't you, Mollie?
Stop screaming, Mollie or we're sunk. I'm trying to think of something before those reporters get back.
Let 'em take me. It's better that way.
What good'll it do?
We'll get you out in ten minutes.
Come on, Mollie. This is no place for you.
They're not human!
They're not human!
They're newspaper men, Mollie. They can't help themselves. The Lord made them that way.
They're newspaper men, Mollie. They can't help themselves. The Lord made them that way.
It wasn't the Lord! It was the devil!
Where are they gone? You know where they are?
Wait a minute, Mollie.
They got him surrounded some place -- gonna shoot him like a dog!
Mollie, they haven't got him. You gotta help me, Mollie! We've got to do something!
Mollie, they haven't got him. You gotta help me, Mollie! We've got to do something!
What do you mean?
What's that?
Quiet, Mollie!
Quiet, Mollie!
There's somethin' funny going on around here.
They'll get him! They'll get him!
Ssh!
I'm coming! Keep dead quiet. Don't even breathe.
I'll be right here. I won't leave you.
What's the idea?
Never mind! Just play dead.
Hey --
Shut up, you!
Are you all right, now?
Yeah, I'm feelin' fine.
What do you want?
I'm a messenger at the State House. This is from the Governor.
I'm a messenger at the State House. This is from the Governor.
What's from the Governor?
What's from the Governor?
The reprieve for Earl Williams.
They were all standing around when he wrote it. It was after they got back from fishing.
Get the Governor on the phone!
Get the Governor on the phone!
You can't get him on the phone. He's out duckshooting now.
You can't get him on the phone. He's out duckshooting now.
Fishing! Duckshooting! How do you like that. A guy does nothing more strenuous for forty years than play pinochle -- he gets elected Governor and right away he thinks he's Tarzan!
Now, listen! You never arrived here with this -- reprieve. Get it?
Yes, I did, just now. Don't you remember?
Yes, I did, just now. Don't you remember?
How much do you make a week?
How much do you make a week?
Huh?
Huh?
How much do you make a week? What's your salary?
How much do you make a week? What's your salary?
Forty dollars.
Who? Me?
Who do you think!
Now, listen. There's a fine opening for a fellow like you in the City Sealer's office.
The what?
The what?
The City Sealer's office!
The City Sealer's office!
You mean here in the city?
You mean here in the city?
Yes, yes!
Why not?
I couldn't work in the city. You see, I've got my family in the country.
I couldn't work in the city. You see, I've got my family in the country.
But you could bring 'em in here! We'll pay all your expenses.
But you could bring 'em in here! We'll pay all your expenses.
No, I don't think so.
No, I don't think so.
For heaven's sake, why not?
For heaven's sake, why not?
I got two kids going to school there, and if I changed them from one town to another, they'd lose a grade.

No, they wouldn't -- they'd gain one! And I guarantee that they'll graduate with highest honors!
No, they wouldn't -- they'd gain one! And I guarantee that they'll graduate with highest honors!
Yeah?
This puts me in a peculiar hole.
No, it doesn't. Now, remember: you never delivered this. You got caught in the traffic, or something. Now, get out of here and don't let anybody see you.
No, it doesn't. Now, remember: you never delivered this. You got caught in the traffic, or something. Now, get out of here and don't let anybody see you.
But how do I know...?
But how do I know...?
Come in and see me in my office tomorrow. What's your name?
Come in and see me in my office tomorrow. What's your name?
Pinkus.
Pinkus.
All right, Mr. Pinkus, all you've got to do is lay low and keep your mouth shut. Here! Go to this address. It's a nice, homey little place, and they'll take care of you for the night. Just tell 'em Fred sent you. And here's fifty dollars on account.
You forgot to tell me what a City Sealer has to do.
I'll explain it tomorrow!
I'll explain it tomorrow!
Is it hard?
Is it hard?
No! It's easy -- it's very easy!
Get out of here!
You can't bribe me!
They wouldn't take it.
You're insane!
Here's the picture of my wife.
A very fine-looking women.
A very fine-looking women.
She's good enough for me! And if I was to go home and tell my wife --
She's good enough for me! And if I was to go home and tell my wife --
I understand perfectly, Mr. Pinkus, and as long as I am Mayor --
If you ask us, no. If you ask the state alienists, the answer is yes.
It's a simple story. Earl Williams works for the E.J. McClosky Manufacturing Company as a bookkeeper for fourteen years. He starts in at twenty dollars a week and gradually works his way up to twenty-two fifty. A year ago the McClosky Company goes out of business and Williams loses his job. Take it away, Fred Wilson!
Well, well -- Miss Mollie Malloy.
Hello, Mollie.
Look out!
Look out where you're aiming, will you?
Sure, Mollie, you never looked better in your life.
Yeah, hold the line. Hey, this looks good. An old lady just called the detective bureau and claims Williams is hiding in her cellar. Well - we've looked every other place. Want to go out on it?
Get the cops, somebody.
Come on, fellas.
There she is!
Say, Hildy...
What's your hurry?
We want to see you.
Williams put up a desperate struggle but the police overpowered --
-- tried to shoot it out with the cops but his gun wouldn't work, so --
Well -- Williams goes a little balmy and begins making speeches on a plan he's got to save the world. Only he makes his speeches, usually, on a very busy street and neglects to get a license for it. Well, the cops let him alone as much as they can because he's harmless and they're kinda sorry for him. But one day he decides
His Honor, the Mayor, now comes out with a statement that Earl Williams is a dangerous character in the employ of two or three foreign governments and the police are going to get him dead or alive. Somebody sends out a tip that this guy is hiding in Molly Malloy's joint. And this colored policeman, Daniels, goes over to pick Williams up. Williams has
Baldwin -- his name is.
I give that marriage six months.
Who? Hildy Johnson? She just stepped out. She'll be back in a second. Who? Oh, Mr. Baldwin. Well, if you'll hang on a minute, she ought to be right in. All right.
Baldwin. The blushing bridegroom -- himself.
Baldwin. The blushing bridegroom -- himself.
What's he want?
What's he want?
Wants Hildy -- and sounds very excited.
The door was locked.
She and Mollie were talking.
What's that?
Henry Chapman's daughter. It was Sheila. I remember her from last year.
Henry Chapman's daughter. It was Sheila. I remember her from last year.
So it was. Sheila. This boy will go far.
Can I try?
Put your hand on mine, get the knack of it.
Never let a rat creep up on you.
I think you hit him, Grandpa. He was limping when he ran off.
That was a googly!
I know.
I know.
You're a dark horse, bowling googlies at your age. Toss me up another.
You're a dark horse, bowling googlies at your age. Toss me up another.
No, you're out, Grandpa. It's my turn.
Want to know why they're called Faith, Hope, Grace and Charity?
Why?
Why?
Your grandmother. She named them after virtues I lack. That's marriage for you.
This is going too far, young man.
But Grandpa, you said...
But Grandpa, you said...
I concede I was insistent, but how the Devil...
Give him the you-know-what.
Very well, Grandpa.
You miserable little tripe-hound. I'm the one who should be fed up, sacrificing my last sup of black market petrol to take you to school.
I have to live in Rosehill Avenue as well.

Only till they get you into the local school.

With Mrs. Evans. I hate her.
With Mrs. Evans. I hate her.
You'll be at home for the weekends. Now shut up, or walk.
It's true.
You're much more convincing when you're making it up.
Grandpa, if you think of something hard enough, can you make it happen?
Apparently so.
Pauline's mum got killed.
No, she didn't.
No, she didn't.
Yes, she did, didn't she?
What are you doing here? This is our territory
Looking for shrapnel.
I never was.
Yes, you was. Make him talk.
I know a secret.
What's that?
What's that?
The Germans are dropping men on bomb sites.
The Germans are dropping men on bomb sites.
Who told you that?
My uncle's in the War Office. He said, Don't go on the bomb sites. "Boys are going missing all the time."
They're not.
You want to join our gang?
I don't mind.
I don't mind.
Do you know any swear words?
Do you know any swear words?
Yes.
Yes.
Say them.
Well go on then. You can't join if you can't answer.
I only know one.
That word is special. That word is only for something really important. Now, repeat after me... Bugger off.
Bugger off.
Bugger off.
Sod.
Sod.
Sod.

Bloody.
Bloody.

Now put them together. Bugger off, you bloody sod.
Now put them together. Bugger off, you bloody sod.
Bugger off, you bloody sod.
Bugger off, you bloody sod.
OK. You're in.
They pulled them up from all the crossroads, so when the Germans land they'll lose their way.
Won't they have maps?
Won't they have maps?
They'll have to go to a shop to buy a map, stupid. Then they'll give zemselves avay viz ze vay zay tork.
He's never going to come back. He's gone off to be a soldier and Mummy doesn't even know.
It doesn't matter, I can drive the car home.
It doesn't matter, I can drive the car home.
You wouldn't.
You wouldn't.
Would.
Would.
You couldn't.
You couldn't.
Could.
Go and ask her if she wants to play.
Ask her yourself.
Ask her yourself.
You do it. You're a girl.
Tell them about Pauline's mum.
Not now. They wouldn't believe me.
Bruce, look! Dad got some German jam.
We thought it was poison.
I suppose they're still learning, that's why they keep moving about.
It's easy. I've done it.
It's easy. I've done it.
Who with?
Who with?
Pauline.
Pauline.
Liar. Mummy keep still and Daddy moves on top of her. That's what they do when they know how.
I did see them. I did.
He's the worst liar.
You're the biggest fibber.
It's dinner time. It really is. Cross my heart.
The next one is ours. Either it hits us or it goes past us.
...and four and five...
...and four and five...
Please God. Not on us. Drop it on Mrs. Evans. She's a cow.
Please God. Not on us. Drop it on Mrs. Evans. She's a cow.
...and six...
Can't we just see the end?
They've got the real thing outside.
They've got the real thing outside.
It's not the same.
Mind that shrapnel DAWN thrusts a brass regimental hat badge in BILL'S face.
I'm starting my own collection.
I'm starting my own collection.
It's Canadian. Where'd you get it?
Well, I'm not having any. Even if it's not poisoned. I don't think it's right. It's not patriotic.
You don't like jam. You hate jam. You never eat jam.
You don't like jam. You hate jam. You never eat jam.
That's not the point.
You did that for me, and on the last day of your holidays?
Well, for the baby, really.
Well, for the baby, really.
Thank you Billy, from the baby and me.
Crocodiles! Aah!
The sodding water table.
But Dad, It's the News.
Thanks, son. I can hear it. I'm not sleeping, just closing my eyes.
Now, the googly looks like a leg break, but it's really an off break. Got it? Like this.
It's like telling fibs.
It's like telling fibs.
That's it. When you tell a lie, you hope to get away with it. When someone else does, you want to find them out. A good batsman will spot a googly. A good bowler will hide it. Always remember that, son.
You said that last year, Dad.
The land and the King are one, my son. If he stutters we falter. He's getting batter, and so are we.
What's that?
Big Berthas, shelling France. Twenty-five-mile range, they have.
Big Berthas, shelling France. Twenty-five-mile range, they have.
Wow!
Wow!
They send over a few every day, to let them know we're still here. Each shell costs as much as a Ford 8.
They send over a few every day, to let them know we're still here. Each shell costs as much as a Ford 8.
Who pays for them?
Who pays for them?
We will, you will, for the rest of our lives?
It was great for me, how was it for you.
A bit too quick.
A bit too quick.
Well. Now we can do it slow. Are those some kind of stockings you're wearing?
Well. Now we can do it slow. Are those some kind of stockings you're wearing?
They might be.
They might be.
I mean, no suspenders. They just kinda' disappear up your ass.
Take it away. I know your husband's been away a long time, but....
Don't be so cheeky, Bruce.
Boy, that was some air-raid.
Air-raid?
Air-raid?
Didn't you feel the house rock? You must have seen all those shell bursts.
What is it?
We're not supposed to say, but we're being shipped out tomorrow.
We're not supposed to say, but we're being shipped out tomorrow.
Where?
Where?
I don't know?
I don't know?
You do, you do. You're just not saying.
You do, you do. You're just not saying.
I swear I don't know. Here's your Christmas present.
You expect me to spend the rest of the war sitting at home staring at a ring? And you'll meet some French girl who can speak your own language. No thank you!
Please yourself.
Could you seal it over with hot pitch, Clive? Caulk it like the hull of a ship.
Thanks. I hope you can come for the launching.
...It was a toss-up. His company went to India, mine went to France. Flip of a coin.
...two Indians to fan me all night. The heat.
...two Indians to fan me all night. The heat.
....buried In a shell-hole for thee days, while he's out there playing polo and sticking pigs.
And Jim.
What's left of him. He'll never see outside of the Star and Garter.
Root it out Clive... the thought of it, before it takes hold.
Weeds will grow, Mac.
Weeds will grow, Mac.
Consider Grace, the kids. I love them like my own. And you.
Consider Grace, the kids. I love them like my own. And you.
Kiss me Hardy.
You're a mug, Clive. We did our bit in the Last Lot.
If King and Country call, Mac, you go as soon as I will.
What did we know? We were seventeen.
I heard the drum and fife yesterday, Mac, marching past. Made my hair stand on end. I thought, I've been asleep for twenty years.
What kind of war is this Mac? Up there in Cumberland, we never see an air-raid. The worst problem I have is getting a new typewriter ribbon. When I rode in against the Turks, I knew what it was about.
Did you? You thought you did. We've been gypsed, all our lives. Look at your street.
What about it?
Rosehill Avenue. No roses. No hill. And it's certainly not an avenue.
Rosehill Avenue. No roses. No hill. And it's certainly not an avenue.
Why not?
Why not?
You need trees for an avenue.
You need trees for an avenue.
There was talk of planting some when we first came.
There was talk of planting some when we first came.
Propaganda. We've been had.
How's your war, Mac?
Never done better. On the fiddle. Like everyone else.
Never done better. On the fiddle. Like everyone else.
Except the servicemen.
Except the servicemen.
Naturally.
Naturally.
I don't understand. Is there any point to it?
I don't understand. Is there any point to it?
There is all right. This Hitter fellow. We've got to winkle him out. And get shot of some of our lot at the same time.
You always were, Clive. Steady the Buffs.
Bugger the Buffs.
Don't panic! Keep your head!
I will if you will!
So you're going to be a grandfather.
And I'm still just a lad myself.
And I'm still just a lad myself.
Don't bother to grow up. It's no fun at all.
Here's to music. And absent friends.
And absent bridegrooms!
And absent bridegrooms!
And the bride.
No Turks.
We didn't know that. It was a suicide mission. Machetes against artillery. Volunteers only.
We didn't know that. It was a suicide mission. Machetes against artillery. Volunteers only.
They'd gone.
We all had to write a last letter home.
And it was the last. Hasn't written a letter since. Not even a birthday card.
Has Sue got it right?
What's that?
What's that?
You joined up.
You joined up.
Oh, that.
Oh, that.
I wish you could have told me yourself. Oh, Grace, it's not for long. They say it'll be over by Christmas.
And what's that?
Jam.
We don't know anything about it
Well, it's off ration. We know that.
Well, it's off ration. We know that.
How do we know they didn't plant it there? They know we're mad on jam. They could poison half the country.
Well?
It looks....foreign.
It looks....foreign.
Jam is jam! It's just jam!
Taste it. Why don't you taste it?
You taste it.
You mean they let you go through the officer training course and then said you were too old for a commission?
That's it.
That's it.
Why didn't they say that before you started?
Why didn't they say that before you started?
I wasn't too old when I started the course. I was too old when it finished.
I wasn't too old when I started the course. I was too old when it finished.
What are you going to be then?
What are you going to be then?
A clerk. I'm doing a typing course. I'll be typing for England.
When do you think you'll get leave again?
Not till Christmas, I don't suppose.
I'm glad you didn't send them to your aunt.
I've had a letter from her. They've moved house.
I've had a letter from her. They've moved house.
Where to?
I've found a bungalow to rent up the towpath, Clive. I never want to leave the river again. The children have had such a wonderful summer.
Fair enough. The river.
I doubt if a few bombs would wake up Dawn on a Sunday morning.
This phoney war get's on my nerves. If we're going to have a war, I wish they'd get it started.
This phoney war get's on my nerves. If we're going to have a war, I wish they'd get it started.
Just ignore her, Mac.
You know it? It must be an old one.
Ancient. Have you finished your homework?
Ancient. Have you finished your homework?
After this dance.
He always knows.
Half the time he's bluffing.
What would we do if a German came into the house?
Don't be silly, Dawn.
Don't be silly, Dawn.
Well, why do you always bring the carving knife in here?
Tell me the truth. You had to get married, didn't you? Because of me.
The ideas you get in your head.
The ideas you get in your head.
That's why you never liked me. I'm different from you. Well, everything's different now, so it doesn't matter. So there.
I won't have this vulgar talk in my house.
It's only a joke, Mummy. I'm fifteen. I'm still at school. I want to be a nun when I grow up.
And where do you think you're going?
Out.
Out.
You go to bed this minute and take off that lipstick.
You go to bed this minute and take off that lipstick.
No, I won't.
I want him. I want him so much. I'll kill myself if I can't have him.
There, there, my baby.
You better bring him home, if you really love him. Don't kill love. You'll regret it for the rest of your life.
Who said anything about love?
What is it, pet?
He's being posted. I was terrible to him.
He's being posted. I was terrible to him.
Don't leave it like that. Go after him. Swallow your pride.
What did he say?
He said I was right. I shouldn't wait for him. I was better to make a clean break.
He said I was right. I shouldn't wait for him. I was better to make a clean break.
I think it's very sensible in the circumstances.
I think it's very sensible in the circumstances.
Now he's gone and made me fall in love with him, which I never wanted to do. I told him that.
I don't believe this is happening to me.
It's not. It's happening to me.
It looks a bit fishy to me.
Could we salt them, or smoke them, do you think?
Now take deep breaths, and push.
Why? It's coming on its own. It doesn't hurt.
Is it peace in out time?
No, Mother! It's War! War!
No, Mother! It's War! War!
Or what?
Did they say how long it would take to get new ration books, Grace?
Up to six weeks, I think.
Up to six weeks, I think.
How are we going to cope?
...such nice boys with straw boaters and blazers. All the punts lit up with Chinese lanterns. Like fireflies. And the gramophone going on one of the boats. Always the Charleston, the Charleston, the Charleston. Oh, you girls.
Wasn't it lovely?
It was the best time of his life.
How many of our class left? You and me out of twenty-eight.
I can't do it. What's the point?
It's just the wrench, Grace. It's for their sake.
Please yourself. Let them go, if they want.
Grace!
It seems to have survived.
Play something, Grace.
Mac, that was wonderful. I haven't been to a concert since...
...since I used to take you to the Proms?
...since I used to take you to the Proms?
That's right. Not since then Not since I got married.
Remember this beach, Mac? All those summers. Out two families, together.
Happy days. When you're bigger, Bill, I'll teach you the googly.
Mac, did you ever find out who Molly went off with?
A Polish pilot. It's like one of those jokes on the wireless.
She said, 'I know you love me, Mac, but you've never loved me enough.'
Not loving enough. That is a terrible thing to do to someone. I suppose I did it to Clive. Always held something back.
It's all better left unsaid, Grace.
You were never apart, you and Clive. He kept asking and asking. And I waited and waited for you to say something. And you never did.

Clive had a job. I didn't. I couldn't.
He could always make me laugh.
We did the decent thing.

This war's put an end to decent things. I want to close my eyes and jump and give myself for once, hold nothing back.

We can't change what's past. Not even the war can do that.
We did all the proper things, and we lost love. That's sad, Mac.
Bless you, Mac. What would I have done without you?
You might still have a house.

I wish it could all have been different.

And...and...Henry Chapman's girl, was it Thelma? No, I can see those cornflower eyes...I've lost your name, my sweetness.

You married that fool, Clive, that's what. Never mind, you can stay with us.

How long?
What can you do with four daughters, I asked myself, A string quartet was all I could come up with. They hated me for making them learn.
And now we're glad you did.
It's not fair on them. It's selfish to keep them with you.
My aunt in Australia has offered..
It's so far way. I couldn't bear it.
Kids don't care. You're thinking of yourself.
I didn't mean it like that, Grace. Why does it always come out wrong?
I know you mean well.
God, how I hate all this scrimping and squalor.
I don't mind it. It was harder before the war. Trying to keep up appearances. Now it's patriotic to be poor.
I don't know how you cope, Grace. Three kids, army pay. On your own.
You know something, Molly? I like it on my own. I never got used to sharing a bed, not really.
Molly!
Well! I'm not talking about Mac. He hasn't toughed me for ages. And not often ever. My life started when Mac went on nights.
You're having me on, Molly.

He tried to burn the house down, said it was possessed by the spirits. Tiny was sleeping in the basement where the fire started. I don't think Earl ever meant to harm us... but Tiny was badly burnt, his ears were destroyed and most of his skin.
Huh?

Wait, I want to say good-bye.
That's true, Otis... not that we're having a bad time, but...
Well, go get her.
Hey.

Local girl, Karen Murphy, been missing for a couple months, figured for a runaway.
Fit the profile?
Fit the profile?
No, not really. Good kid, never been in any trouble.
Christ, four kids couldn't just disappear.
No they couldn't, somebody had to see something.
No they couldn't, somebody had to see something.
My Denise is a smart girl, she wouldn't do anything stupid, and her boyfriend, he always seemed like a good kid.
Turn up this road.
Where we headed?
Shit, don't these packrat hillbillies throw anything away?
Shhhh... you hear that?
Yeah, I hear it... where's it coming from?
Over here, inside the smokehouse.
We gotta break it open.
I ain't got a warrant.
Tell it to my daughter.
Shit... fuck procedure.
Jesus Christ.
Call Wydell.
Fuck, go to the car... call for backup. Tell 'em officer down.
Right.
Mr. Willis?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
I'm Wydell... this is Naish.
Well, we were on our way out to run a check on a couple farmhouses out on the edge of town... closest thing we got to a lead at this point.
That's it?
That's it?
Well, all we know is the kids were headed out to a spot the locals call Deadwood to play Nancy Drew with some local legend about this character everybody calls Dr. Satan.
Well, all we know is the kids were headed out to a spot the locals call Deadwood to play Nancy Drew with some local legend about this character everybody calls Dr. Satan.
Dr. Satan?
What about the body you found?
Oh, yeah, you know about that? Hmmm, that's a strange one.
Her part in this I can't figure... but I will.
Christ, you know it's crazy... I lived through so many other people's nightmares, you know. Always cool and calm, but... but I never thought I'd be the one needing help, ya know?
I'm sure there's a logical explanation.
I pray to God there is.
Well, let's go see if the nut that runs this place can help us.
Right.
Boss, the way I see it is these kids probally stop off somewhere, bought a bunch of booze and are off getting shitfaced.
I hope you're right, but my guts are telling me different.

Sounds like a bad idea to me, probally just get in the way.
Sounds like a bad idea to me, probally just get in the way.
Yeah, well I guess it's tough to sit on the sidelines and wait when your own kid's missing... besides, ain't no such thing as an ex-cop.
Yeah, well I guess it's tough to sit on the sidelines and wait when your own kid's missing... besides, ain't no such thing as an ex-cop.
I guess not.
I guess not.
That must be him.
Yeah it's horseshit, just some boogieman crap that the kids like to scare each other with.
Anyway, there's not much else out that way... so, I figure maybe there's a chance the kids broke down and found their way over to one of the farms.
Don't worry, we'll find her.
Let's hit the road, sooner we get a move on sooner we'll find her.
I'm gonna see if anybody's home. You and Mr. Willis take a look around the grounds for any sign of anything.
Right... ...come on.
Wydell.
Excuse me for a second.
Over.
We found one.
And furthermore... Tell him, Harold.
Uh... We must never act like apes, son. For you see, The ape is our closest biological relative -- specifically the pygmy chimp. A single chromosome separates us. But you know what truly separates us from the apes, what makes us better than apes?
That is the wrong fork, young man. Harold, tell the boy.
That is the wrong fork, young man.
Harold! Tell the boy again.
No "buts." Go to your room now.

Son, your mother and I are doing a production of The Gin Game at the local community theater. We forgot to take off our make-up.
Tell him, Harold.
It's going famously, son, famously!
Lila, what are you doing in there? I need to get ready for my date.
Nothing! I'll be out in a minute!
I don't know why you didn't tell me about this.

As much as I loved Nathan, I'm not sorry she killed him, if it means I can have you. Is that a terrible thing to say, my sweet?
Hush. No, it is never terrible to be in love. Nathan's memory lives on in our sacred union. I'm not sorry she killed him either. Nathan was wonderful. He was erudite and sophisticated and charming. You are all that, too. But you have something more. You have a bit of the animal in you.
Let's go eat, I'm starved.

No. Don't be silly. It's just...
No. Don't be silly. It's just...
I am a foolish little thing. I am pink in my face, no? It is only that I have been so lonely lately and... I am ashamed. I'll see you tomorrow, okay? Unless... Am I fired now?
Thank you so much for accompanying me.
Not at all.
Not at all.
I have had such a difficult time in my personal life and you seem to be such a nice man... but I'm talking too much again, no?

Of course not.
Of course not.
You're so sweet. Oh, why are there not more men out there like you?
Listen, you're the best assistant I've ever had... Gabrielle.
I like it when you say my name. Is that stupid?
Oh, Doctor. I did not know. I'm sorry to disturb you. I just came for some papers I left.
Gabrielle. No, I'm sorry if I startled you. I came to think. God, Did I hang up on you?

I was in my p.j.'s when I remembered I left some papers I need to go over. See? I rushed right out of the house. I must look a mess. I'm so embarrassed.

I'm in my p.j.'s, too. Funny, huh?
Coincidence, yes? And how is our son?
Our...? Oh! He seems fine. I guess we woke him. The lights and all.
Our...? Oh! He seems fine. I guess we woke him. The lights and all.
I should turn them off. Maybe I sing him a lullaby my mama sang to me when I was a little girl.

Maybe we should just sit for a while. It's very peaceful.

So soft. So smooth. I'm sorry. It's just...
Shh.
What is wrong, my darling?
Nothing, my darling. All is right with the world.
Dr. Bronfman's line. Yes. One moment please. Lila.
Shit. Hi, honey.
Yeah. Okay. Be home around seven. Bye. What? I'm sorry. What was I supposed to do?
I don't know, Nathan. What are you supposed to do?
I don't know, Nathan. What are you supposed to do?
You don't abandon somebody because they have a physical problem.
You don't abandon somebody because they have a physical problem.
Funny. I thought that's exactly what you did. You just don't have the courage to admit it to yourself.
Isn't Puff doing spectacularly, honey?
Hmmmph.
Hmmmph.
Gabby, what is it?
Gabby, what is it?
Hmmph. Hmmph. Nathan, we have to talk, you and I.

Very well.
My little French.
Stop. Get away.

What is it?

You have to choose Nathan. It's like Sophie's choice. Only it is Nathan's choice. Did you ever see that movie, Sophie's Choice? It is like that. Only it is this.

Gabby, you know I'm trying to sort things out.
Gabby, you know I'm trying to sort things out.
No! It is now that you must decide. I love you, Doctor Nathan... ...but I will not wait. I will not be your chippy. I will not be your little Mademoiselle Parlez-vous side dish. My love. I want to have a sweet tiny baby inside my belly... from you.
I love you so much, Gabrielle.
But?... But? There is a "but," Nathan.
But?... But? There is a "but," Nathan.
But I don't know how to leave Lila.
You were wonderful today, darling. Such authority with the ape-man boy. It made me so hot for you.
Unnhh.

The way you are taming him, it sends chills down my girlish spine and... everywhere else, too.

Yeah? What?
Hi. It's Nathan.
Call you back. You bastard! What do you want?
I just want to talk.
I just want to talk.
We have nothing to say! You are a rotten bastard, that's what!
Please. Just one minute of your time.
Why? You've made your decision, Mister Stinky American! Now I hate you! No, I don't hate you; I don't even think about you!
Why? You've made your decision, Mister Stinky American! Now I hate you! No, I don't hate you; I don't even think about you!
I've got some things to tell you.
Like what?
Well, I think it would be easier if I could talk to you in person.
Well, I think it would be easier if I could talk to you in person.
What for?
Well, I think...
You think too much. I need a man who doesn't think so much but acts more than he thinks... is what I need!

Just give me some time to let Lila down easily. She's a really nice girl and I don't want to hurt her more than is necessary.

You hurt me, you know, when you made Nathan's Choice. Does that not even matter to you, you pig?
You were wonderful!
Was I? I wasn't a tad stiff?
Was I? I wasn't a tad stiff?
Don't be silly! And you were wonderful, too! I loved the way you said " au revoir."
So we've got seventeen new bookings for speaking engagements, my wonderful men.
Terrific. We're all going to be rich and famous.
Lila?
That's Lila?
A penny for your thoughts, mon cheri.
I don't know. Something's missing.
Yes, please, somebody ask him what is wrong.
I don't know.
I want our boy back.
Oui.
Oui.
That bitch. I worked so hard. We worked so hard, you and I. He would've made us famous.
That bitch. I worked so hard. We worked so hard, you and I. He would've made us famous.
We still have you and I.

You better believe they're dirty! And smelly! And messy! And they don't know their forks from their assholes!
I'm going alone. This could be dangerous.
Okay, my sweet. Good night.

A little resistance would be nice, damn it.

Please let me go with you.

No.
No.
Okay.
My apologies, madam.
It's okay, Puff.
It's okay, Puff.
Shan't happen again.
It shan't happen again. I swear it. I'm just getting my sea legs, you know.
It's an animal urge, Puff. It's nothing to be ashamed of.
Very well.
Very well.
We're going back to nature, you and I. I'm going to retrain you. I'm going to make you free again if I have to kill you doing it.
But I like being human now.
You what?
I want to be the way I was before.
I want to be the way I was before.
Good. I'll show you how, apey.
Nice night.
Talking is to be kept to a minimum. Eventually, when we are ready, there will be none. Language was invented so that people could lie to each other and to themselves. There is no other reason.
You'll thank me eventually, Puff. Well, you won't thank me, because we won't be speaking, but you'll sort of thank me with a special look, the look a dog gives you to let you know he loves you.
What an enchanting picture you paint of our future together.
He's dead.
We bury the body. We disappear into the woods. Nobody knows.

No. This is the end of the road. There's a dead human being here. For all of his faults, he was a human being, and certainly a victim of his culture as much as anybody.
No. This is the end of the road. There's a dead human being here. For all of his faults, he was a human being, and certainly a victim of his culture as much as anybody.
Forget him, Lila. We'll disappear. We'll never talk about it again. We'll never talk again period. I love you.
Forget him, Lila. We'll disappear. We'll never talk about it again. We'll never talk again period. I love you.
Puff, what happened to you is as much my fault as Nathan's. Maybe more so, because I knew it was wrong and I went along with it anyway. I'm taking responsibility for the murder. I want you to go back to your old life.

I won't let you do that. I shot the bastard. And I'm glad.
I won't let you do that. I shot the bastard. And I'm glad.
No. Go back to the woods. This is a sacrifice I need to make. In my world we have something called penance. It's another abstraction, but I had the concept drummed into my head during my years in the convent. It doesn't exist for you, and it shouldn't. See, I could never be free again anyway, so I might as well be in jail.

Then I'll live for both of us, Lila. I'll be the most free, truest animal in the whole forest. For both of us.

My brother says the guy's a thirty- five year old virgin, so maybe he won't know how women usually feel. Plus he's got bad eyesight, almost legally blind, which is helpful in this situation. Plus he's got an extremely small penis, of which he is "mortifyingly ashamed", so chances are he'll be so grateful for any non- judgmental attention, that he'll be yours forever.

I don't know, honey. I don't know. Maybe he just didn't want to get involved.
Oh, Rosie.
Oh, Rosie.
Let's get you out of here. Come stay with me until you get your strength back. Free electrolysis, if you want it! We'll get that face of yours cleared up in no time.
Done!
Ready!
Uh, tie them up, Rosie. If you will.
With pleasure.

The truth is most people don't have table manners today. And when the foundations of civilized society crumble and disappear, civilized society in its entirely follows closely at its heels.

Oh, darling. I'm so relieved. Let's celebrate with a long hike in the woods tomorrow!
That's a great idea.
It'll be wonderful! I'll show you my old stomping grounds!
Terrific. Can't wait!

What SPF, sweetie?
Fifteen.
Fifteen.
Perfectomundo! We are ready! Say, wouldn't it be wonderful to have an insect repellent lotion that also worked as a sun block? Think of all the time one would save.

I think I'll get Johannsen in chemistry on that. Oh! Did you bring the first aid kit?

We could call it "Quit Bugging Me, Sunny." Get it? Sunny. S-u-n-n-y.

That's very funny.
That's very funny.
I love you so much.
Did you see that?
What?
What?
I don't know. Something.
I don't know. Something.
A deer?
A deer?
No. Too... upright. Might've been a person.
No. Too... upright. Might've been a person.
It might behoove us to turn back at this point.
Come on.
If it's a person, why should we go see it? It's not like it's nature or anything. It's just a person. Sometimes people who live in the woods don't want to be seen. They live in the woods because they're anti-social, Lila. We have to respect that.
You'll catch cold. It's cold. What do you suppose he is, a survivalist?
I think he's feral.

Nathan, what the hell are you talking about?

Oh no. You can't take him from his home, Nathan.
Oh no. You can't take him from his home, Nathan.
Don't you see? He's my Tabula Rasa, my Eliza Dolittle. He's my ticket to the top of the Behaviorist food chain. He's going to make me famous.

I won't allow you. It's wrong. He's happy here.
I won't allow you. It's wrong. He's happy here.
Is he, Lila? Is he happy living filthy and naked alone in this tick infested wilderness? Never to know the love of a good woman, never to revel in the pitter-patter of little feet, never to read Moby Dick, or marvel at a Monet, or just sit back after a day of hard but rewarding work, smoke a pipe, and wonder about the nature

You'd be taking away his freedom, Nathan.
You'd be taking away his freedom, Nathan.
Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose, Lila, to quote Janet Jackson.
...what is it that makes us human, if not the knowledge that we are indeed human? Think of this poor soul's education as the greatest gift we could bestow upon...
All right.
All right.
Great. Grab his feet. We'll throw him in the trunk.
What are you doing in there?
Nothing. Be right out.
Who is it?
Uh-huh. Right, Gabrielle. Right.
Who is it?
Absolutely, Gabrielle. Someone from work! Sorry about that, Gabrielle. Uh-huh. Exactly.
Who from work?
Excuse me one second, would you, Gabrielle?
It's hormonal, Nathan. I can't help it. I'm sorry.
Your entire body?

I'm the same person I was before you knew, damn it! Oh God!

I have to think! I have to think!
Was that okay? I mean, was I able to... satisfy you?
You are an animal.

Really? Wow! That's that's terrific to hear from someone so... feminine, so female.

I love being female because it, how do you say, allows me to be close to men.

I'm glad you're female. Do you think our boy witnessed the primal scene?
So, how's it going today?
Good. Making progress.
Good. Making progress.
Honey, can we talk tonight? You know, about stuff? Things have been so strained for the past three weeks, since you know, and I just want to talk.
Everything's fine, honey. We don't need to talk. Besides I have to work late.
Please, Nathan. I really need this. You've been working late a lot.
Are you seeing somebody else, Nathan? I just have to know.
Of course not.
Of course not.
It would just be helpful to know.
It would just be helpful to know.
No.
No.
Because, you know, you seem so distant. And you work late every night. And we hardly ever have sex, and when we do, it's... I don't know. It feels different.

Yeah. It's nice. It's really good.

I'm trying, you know. I'm trying to be what you want. I want to be what you want, Nathan. All I want is to be what you want.
I'm trying, you know. I'm trying to be what you want. I want to be what you want, Nathan. All I want is to be what you want.
Shh. It's okay. It's okay, Lila. You're what I want. You know that. You're exactly what I want.
Shh. It's okay. It's okay, Lila. You're what I want. You know that. You're exactly what I want.
Really?

Sure. Of course.

Because I'm really trying, you know. Rosie says maybe only another two years of the elctrolysis.

That's great.
That's great.
I've signed up for a ballet class. And look at my nails! A real girl!
That's great. It's a great color for you.
Oh, Nathan, let's have a baby!
Oh! I didn't see you there, sneaky boy! You're like a boy sneaking in...
...the back door of a movie theater. Yes, indeed.

You remember that from my book? I'm touched! What's wrong?

I'll make it. I'm so happy, Nathan! Everything's going to be so great! Scotch on the rocks, right? Just kidding. I know what you drink, mister. I know what you drink. Voila!
How's work?
Cruddy, okay? Are you satisfied?
Cruddy, okay? Are you satisfied?
No. I don't want your work to be cruddy.

I guess.
Hey! I could come work for you! I know I haven't been all that supportive of this project, but I've come around.
Have you?
Have you?
Oh yes, baby! I think that this is a wonderful project you're doing, taking this poor unfortunate, uncivilized creature and turning him into a human being! What a wonderful wonderful compassionate man you are!

I had sold my fucking soul.
I had sold my fucking soul.
I let her sell her soul. I stood by as she did it. It's inexcusable. At the time though I thought it might help.
Bravo to you, Puff!
That was wonderful!
I think he's ready.
Oh boy!
You just have to control it. We're not apes.
Thank you very much for that.
Puff, I'm proud of you! You did remarkably well under difficult circumstances.
Absolutely!
I'm going to go down and check on Puff. See how he's holding up.
Should I come with?
Should I come with?
Nah. You just relax. How's the book?
Nah. You just relax. How's the book?
Ummm. It's good.
You were gone a long time.
Yeah. Puff and I got into a big, philosophical discussion. He's really quite well read, considering he's only been literate for a month now. He's going to make us famous, Lila.

Seemed fine. Quiet evening enjoying his new digs.

That's funny because, you know, I just went and picked him up at some flophouse on the lower eastside. He called here when he ran out of his "mad" money after spending an entire evening drinking, watching strippers, and fucking a whore! Oh, and what did you do tonight, honey?

Do you know what I gave up to be with you?

Yes.
Yes.
I gave up my soul, my beliefs. I gave up my body hair!
I gave up my soul, my beliefs. I gave up my body hair!
Yeah, well, I'm sorry. The human heart is a strange thing.
Yeah, well, I'm sorry. The human heart is a strange thing.
How the hell would you know anything about the human heart?
How the hell would you know anything about the human heart?
Lila...
Shut up! Yeah, this is Lila, cunt. And don't let the hirsutism fool you. I know more about being a woman, and more about the black hearts of men than you, in your pretty little powdered, bullshit fantasy world, can ever imagine. I know the darkness and cruelty of nature, sweetie pie.
Lila, you don't intend to hurt us, do you?
Lila, you don't intend to hurt us, do you?
Eat shit, thumbtack dick! Thank you, Frank. You're the best.
Aha! Finally. I've covered almost the entire seaboard and parts of eastern Ohio.
Ugnh.
Look at you two. You both disgust me.
Oook. Oook.
Oook. Oook.
Shut up! I gave you... life. I created you in my image, Puff. I took you from this primordial ooze and brought you into the world of culture and art and manners. And this is how you repay me? By heading back to the ooze first chance you get? I should leave you here with Lila the ape woman. It would serve you right,

Don't worry, Lila. You can stay. I don't have any interest in you anymore. C'mon, monkey boy.
Good-eve-n-ing-lay-dees-and-gent- elmen.
Bravo, Puff! Bravo!
Oh boy!
Now, Puff, we're leaving on the electronic collar. I don't think we'll need to shock you, but just in case.
Now, Puff, we're leaving on the electronic collar. I don't think we'll need to shock you, but just in case.
Okay. That's fair.
This is great, Puff. You're doing fine.
I'm loving this. It's such a treat to be out and about. What a wonderful invention a city is. The immense buildings of glass and steel glinting in the afternoon sun, the smartly dressed women in their best summer frocks, the colorful street vendors.
I don't think this aversion therapy is really necessary, doctor. I understand the problem.
Humor me, Puff. It's essential that I am able to trust you to function independently in the world.
Humor me, Puff. It's essential that I am able to trust you to function independently in the world.
I bow to your expertise in these matters.

Lila?
Excellent work, Puff. Extra desert tonight.
Yahoo!
Yahoo!
Tomorrow, the acid test.
Did I? I tried so hard! I really concentrated! Oh, I'm so happy!
And because you did so well, we have a little surprise for you.
And because you did so well, we have a little surprise for you.
Extra dessert?

Even better.
Free to come and go as you please. There's some "mad money" in the night table drawer.
It's wonderful! Do you think I'm ready? Do you really?
It's wonderful! Do you think I'm ready? Do you really?
I trust that you'll make good, mature decisions. I trust that you'll do the proper thing.
I trust that you'll make good, mature decisions. I trust that you'll do the proper thing.
Oh, I will! Your very trust has instilled an enormous sense of responsibility in me. I don't want to disappoint you.

Got it.
Puff, why don't you say a few words to the assemblage.
It would be my pleasure, doctor. Distinguished gentlemen and ladies of the psychological community, I stand before you today, a living testament to the amazing skill of Dr. Nathan Bronfman. To say that he took me from crayons to perfume would be a vast understatement. Dr. Bronfman took me from playing with my own feces, then to crayons, and then to an appreciation of
Thanks to you, Nate.
Thanks to you, Buddy. And your diligence and intelligence and perseverance.
And of course to you, my sweet, for your... moral support.
here, here.
Interesting.
Now, my diminutive friend, what can I do for you?
Ugnh.
Oh please, is that as articulate as you can be after all the time I spent teaching you? We've discussed Wittgenstein, for Christ's sake. Not that you ever had anything very original or challenging to say on the subject.

Down from the tree. Both of you. Keep your hands where I can see them. Don't want you pulling any weapons out of your fur.
Puff, put the gun down.
Ounpoo. Ungh.
Ounpoo. Ungh.
Let's be reasonable human beings here. We're all reasonable human beings, aren't we?

Look, why don't you and Lila stay here and have your natural life. I'll just go on my way. You'll never see me again.
Look, why don't you and Lila stay here and have your natural life. I'll just go on my way. You'll never see me again.
I have to talk. Is that okay?
You did create me in your image, Nathan. Before you I was a simple, happy, complete being, in harmony with the world around me. After you I became duplicitous, cynical, angry, anal, totally out of touch with my surroundings. In a word, Nathan, I became you. Lila has reintroduced me to myself. And, incidentally, what I'm about to do, kill you, is something that
No.
So anyway, that's the nightmare I've been having lately.
Do you suppose it has anything to do with Lila's unusually hairy body?
Do you suppose it has anything to do with Lila's unusually hairy body?
No, why?
No, why?
Well, it seems that since Lila broached the subject of children, you've been on edge and I know you have an issue with the, uh, body hair.
Well, it seems that since Lila broached the subject of children, you've been on edge and I know you have an issue with the, uh, body hair.
Oh, I see. Yes, that's something to think about. That's very good. That's what you get the big bucks, right? Ha ha.
Oh, I see. Yes, that's something to think about. That's very good. That's what you get the big bucks, right? Ha ha.
I just think it might be important to explore your feelings for Lila.
I just think it might be important to explore your feelings for Lila.
I love Lila. I mean, she's a wonderful person. And... she loves me! That's no small potatoes. I mean she really loves me. She's sacrificed so much to be in this relationship with me. And she's a good person. A truly good person. How rare is that in this world, eh? And how could I stop loving somebody because of a little physical imperfection,

And how do you feel about Gabrielle?
Wait!
Yes?
Yes?
I saw you on C-Span. I've been looking for you for thirty years. Then there you were, such a beautiful, beautiful grown man.
Mother?
Yes... Derek.
It's a pleasure to meet you, mother. But I'm an ape like dad was... And I have to go back into the woods now... forever.
Yes, I suppose so. I suppose I knew that was going to be what you would say. It's good to see you again though.
Yes, I suppose so. I suppose I knew that was going to be what you would say. It's good to see you again though.

I'm in the book, if you ever want to drop me a line or something.

Yep.
Yep.

Mm hmm.
Mm hmm.
Comin' in or goin' out?
Comin' in or goin' out?
Goin' in. We got a sales convention. Gotta be there tomorrow.
Goin' in. We got a sales convention. Gotta be there tomorrow.
What do you guys sell?
Thanks. Sure is a hot day for driving. Late afternoon is better. You guys have plenty of time. Make Pittsburgh in two, maybe three hours.
Hey, he's right! Whaddya say, Charlie, huh? Play a little pool? Wait out the heat?
About sixty, seventy bucks.
Next game, ten bucks.
Give me some bourbon. J. T. S. Brown.
You want a chaser?
You want a chaser?
No.
Hey, another one for me and another one for the lady.
Check!
Check!
You look different... More relaxed.
Give me a bottle of beer.
Right.
Huh?
It's open... What'll you have?
You sure you going to be comfortable enough there, Miss... ah... ?
Packard. Sarah Packard.
Packard. Sarah Packard.
It always takes me a little while to get a name fixed in my mind. Are you sure you don't want anything?
It always takes me a little while to get a name fixed in my mind. Are you sure you don't want anything?

I've never been to Louisville.
I've never been to Louisville.
Lots of action. Lots of money. Lots of class. You'll see some of the best-dressed and most beautiful women in the world at the races. Knock your eye out.
I'm ready.
Soon as I finish my coffee.
What makes you know so much? How do you know what Eddie was thinking?
I know. Been there myself. We've all been there, haven't we, Miss Packard?
Doesn't your lighter work, Mr. Gordon?
Oh, I forgot all about it. How's the hands?
It's all right, Eddie. I'm sure Mr. Gordon meant no offense. It was a figure of speech.
That's right, Miss Packard.
That's right, Miss Packard.
And a fact is a fact.
And a fact is a fact.
She's a smart girl, Eddie.
Oh, wait a minute, Miss Packard.
We're neighbors now. You can call me Sarah.
I want to talk to you.
Do we need words?
Do we need words?
Yeah, I think we do. We could try to cut each other up. But that would be bad for everybody. Bad for me, bad for you. And worst of all, be bad for Eddie.
Yeah, I think we do. We could try to cut each other up. But that would be bad for everybody. Bad for me, bad for you. And worst of all, be bad for Eddie.
You know what's good for him?
You know what's good for him?
To win.
To win.
For whom and for what?
For whom and for what?
For what makes the world go round. For money, and for glory.
For what makes the world go round. For money, and for glory.
You didn't answer my first question. For whom?
You didn't answer my first question. For whom?
All right. Today for me, tomorrow for himself.
All right. Today for me, tomorrow for himself.
No, there's no tomorrow. Not with you. You own all the tomorrows because you buy them today, and you buy cheap.
No, there's no tomorrow. Not with you. You own all the tomorrows because you buy them today, and you buy cheap.
Well, nobody has to sell.
You bastard.
Listen, Miss Ladybird, you're here on a rain check and I know it. You're hanging on by your nails. You let that glory whistle blow loud and clear for Eddie and you're a wreck on a railroad track. You're a horse that finished last. So don't make trouble, Miss Ladybird. Live and let live. While you can.
I'll make it up to you.
How?
How?
You tell me.
Are you ready for another?
Thank you.
In a little while. That's what you want, isn't it?
It's what Eddie wants. He, uh, told me to give you some money.
Put it on the bed. That's the way it's done, isn't it?
That's the way it's done.
That's the way it's done.
And the way you're looking at me, is that the way you look at a man you've just beaten? As if you'd just taken his money, and now all you want is... his pride?
And the way you're looking at me, is that the way you look at a man you've just beaten? As if you'd just taken his money, and now all you want is... his pride?
All I want's the money.
All I want's the money.
Sure, sure, just the money, and the aristocratic pleasure of seeing him fall apart. You're a Roman, Bert. You have to win them all.
Could be.
Well, Mr. Felson, maybe you could come out to my place some evening. We could play a few games of billiards.
We'll be there.
Good, good.
Oh, we'll start small... a hundred dollars a game.
You ever played billiards before?
I'm sure Mr. Felson knows what he's doing. Certainly you can afford a hundred dollars to find out.
Deal the cards.
How much?
Oh, about five hundred.
Oh, about five hundred.
Do you really think you can beat him?
Do you really think you can beat him?
Of course he thinks he can beat me, Bert. He wouldn't be playing me if he didn't. Right, Felson?
Of course he thinks he can beat me, Bert. He wouldn't be playing me if he didn't. Right, Felson?
I didn't ask him can he beat you. I already know he can beat you. I asked him will he? With Eddie, that's two different things.
Have you noticed, Bert? This fellow here bears a striking resemblance to you. It seems as though you might have modeled for the artist.
It's possible.
That seems a shame. The night is young.
The night is two thousand dollars old.
Will you take a check, Bert?
Cash.
Cash.
How much do I owe you?
How much do I owe you?
Twelve thousand.
Hey, mister.
The name's Gordon. Bert Gordon.
The name's Gordon. Bert Gordon.
Mister. You been sittin' in that spot for hours. Would you mind moving? It bothers me.
Stay with this kid. He's a loser.
What did he say?
Okay?
Sit down.
Make it twenty.
Cut.
Cut.

I'm buyin'.
Thought you only drank milk.
Thought you only drank milk.
Only when I work.
Only when I work.
Yeah? Why?
Yeah? Why?
I like it. It's good for you. Besides, you start drinking whisky gambling and it gives you an excuse for losing. That's something you don't need -- an excuse for losing. How did you make out in the poker game?

You think they call Minnesota Fats the best in the country just 'cause he's got talent? Nah. Minnesota Fats's got more character in one finger than you got in your whole skinny body.

A thousand.
A thousand.
