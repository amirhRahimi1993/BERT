Only if he can be trusted.
He'll do what I say.
I'm curious how you did this with such economy.
Everybody has a weakness.
You watch and learn. I earn his trust. Then more pain. Then I appear with kindness. Within a week he will follow me around like a dog.
But will he be house-trained?
But will he be house-trained?
When he loves me like a father, he will never tell anyone he was here. He will freely give the names of his superiors. Then we get them and they too will give us names. And eventually somebody will get us to Juan Obregon and the cartel will fall.
The cocaine brand, 911, is an East Coast brand, a Juarez Cartel brand, and you must know it usually comes through into El Paso?
I'm aware of that.
I'm aware of that.
So what's it doing in Tijuana?
Let me ask you a hypothetical question: if Salazar worked for Madrigal and the Juaraz cartel, and he went out of power, would it mean the Juarez Cartel is losing influence?
It could mean that, yes.
It could mean that, yes.
That would probably mean the Tijuana Cartel is gaining power?
That would probably mean the Tijuana Cartel is gaining power?
It's possible.
It's possible.
Is it possible to have a Drug Czar in Mexico who isn't connected in some war to one of the cartels?
My work keeps me young.

Noriega was head of a sovereign nation who made the mistake of doing business with the U.S. Government. So, no, I don't have a problem waking up every day and fighting our government, fighting people like you, trying to keep this system a little bit honest.

The busiest land border crossing in the world. Over forty-one thousand vehicles per day, twenty-two thousand pedestrians on foot. I think we do a pretty good job but we know a lot of drugs are still getting through.
Any idea how much?
Any idea how much?
I've read official estimates but I wouldn't bet my house on them. I've heard the entire cocaine supply for the United States can fit into four tractor-trailers. At least a half-dozen of those cars right out there are carrying a load of dope, with drivers employed by people who don't give a damn if they're caught or not.

We ask questions and measure the answers. When something doesn't ring true, a fact that doesn't make sense, a slight hesitation, then it's off to secondary for a closer look. Before NAFTA we had about 1.9 million trucks a year. Now it's almost double. Pretty soon there'll be Mexican truck companies that will have as much freedom in crossing the border as American truck

Any way we can do it better?
Any way we can do it better?
Sure. More money in intelligence on their side of the border. So we have a better idea who we're looking for. More dogs. More people. Supposed to be getting some giant x- ray machines to run the trucks through. Outside of martial law that's about the best you're gonna do. But, I should tell you, there are two things that really have us on

That triple the amount of stuff is going through.
Right. But, that's not the biggest problem. One of our Intel officers picked up information from DEA that traffickers have come up with a process, a chemical process, to turn coke into something else. It doesn't smell like coke. It doesn't look like coke. And what's worse, it doesn't react to field test. It could be anything. Maybe it's already happening. I mean, how

She hasn't called you?

Can you tell me anything? Do you have any ideas?
I don't know what to say.

You don't know what the hell you're talking about. You're a cocky seventeen year-old and you don't have a clue what the stakes are. You don't know the value of the life you've yet to throw away. And neither does she.
Hey man, I'm sorry. I'm just trying to help.
You want to help? Stay the fuck away from her.
I don't know, maybe we missed her.

Hey man, back the fuck up. To this place. What's that shit? Right now, all over this country, a hundred thousand white people from the suburbs are driving around downtown asking every black person they see, You got any drugs? You know where I can get drugs? What kind of effect you think this has on the psyche of a black person, on their
I recruited the best men in Mexico for my task force and put them through a rigorous screening process. Not only physical, but also psychological.
I'd like to bring you up to Washington, walk you around our side of things, and share some of the information we've been able to develop on your cartels.
I'd like to bring you up to Washington, walk you around our side of things, and share some of the information we've been able to develop on your cartels.
That would be very helpful to me. Also, I received the offer from DEA and the FBI to train some of my men at Quantico. I think this will be extremely useful, a good way for us to absorb some of your methods.
You've been making very good progress against the Tijuana cartel.
Yes, I am confident that Juan Obregon will be taken into custody before the end of the year. But, you must understand that it is very difficult because of corruption in the police force. We get a tip that he is one place, then we get there and he is already gone, having been warned by someone on our side.

I just want to be clear about one thing. I used to work for him, but now I work for you. I'm not a partisan person, I'm an issue person. In the next few weeks, if you allow me, we'll get you well-versed on an incredible array of issues. The most important of which, in my opinion, being Mexico. I know everybody that you're
Like you protected Landry?
Like you protected Landry?
I see where you're going with that, but if I could just say something, which is basically that a guy like Landry is so autocratic he doesn't know how to let himself be helped; it's a point of pride to take every bullet, no matter who fired it, or whether it was even aimed at him, which personally I think it very self-defeating. Now,
Hello.
I'm sorry... Did I wake you?
Salazar's been taken down. He was working for Porfirio Madrigal.
What? I thought Madrigal was dead. I thought it was verified.

If we're moving the press conference, we need to do it now. Are you all right?
Who are these guys?
Agents who died in the field.
He died in a liposuction surgery, right?
Right. Now it's used by somebody from the Juarez Cartel, one of his lieutenants... Who knows? Every damn day there's birthday party. At first I thought they must have three hundred children, then I realized they're taunting us. Three miles away and we can't touch them. Ha, ha, ha.
Who do we interface with on their side?
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
I mean, who runs interdiction on the Mexico side?
I mean, who runs interdiction on the Mexico side?
I don't know. I don't think there's any one person. See the problem is the Juarez cartel owns everything and everybody, all the property on the Mexican side, sometimes all the property on both sides. Warehouses, transportation, even tunnels. It's very organized.
What do we do? Okay. Fucked-up Bowman's turning blue. Doctor. We need a doctor.

I'll be right after you.
You'll never catch us, you flabby bastard. Right, see, when I come back --
I want the money, Mark, that's all.
If everyone keeps their mouth shut, there'll be no one going to jail.
I don't know, maybe I'll buy something for my ma, and then buy some good speed, no bicarb like, then get a girl, take her out like, and treat her -- properly.
Shag her senseless.

Aye, OK, Fr. But the good times couldn't last for ever.
It's a scandal, Franco.
Too right it is. Now look, have you got anything to eat, 'cos I'm fucking Lee Marvin, by the way.

This was his nightmare. The dodgiest scam in a lifetime of dodgie scams being perpetrated with three of the most useless and unreliable fuck-ups in town. I knew what was going on in his mind: any trouble in London and he would dump us immediately, one way or another. He had to. If he got caught with a bagful of skag, on top of

Buy yourself that island in the sun?
For four fucking grand? One palm tree, a couple of rocks, and a sewage outflow.
We'll be half-way down the road with the money.
I'd fucking kill you.
I'd fucking kill you.
I guess you would, Franco.
Cool down, Franco. The guy's sorry.
Not sorry enough for being a fat cunt.
Excuse me, I don't mean to harass you, but I was very impressed by the capable and stylish manner in which you dealt with that situation. I thought to myself: she's special.

Tommy was lying around fucked out of his eyeballs on smack or downers. He didn't know you could get toxoplasmosis from cat shit.

No, actually I went to Craignewton but I was worried that you wouldn't have heard of it so I put the Royal Edinburgh College instead, because they're both schools, right, and we're all in this together, and I wanted to put across the general idea rather than the details, yeah? People get all hung up on details, but what's the point? Like which school?

Otherwise we wouldn't do it. After all, we're not fucking stupid. At least, we're not that fucking stupid. Take the best orgasm you ever had, multiply it by a thousand

I would say, in those days, he was a muscular actor, in every sense, with all the presence of someone like Cooper or Lancaster, but combined with a sly wit to make him a formidable romantic lead, closer in that respect to Cary Grant.

I think Allison had been screaming all day, but it hadn't really registered before. She might have been screaming for a week for all I knew. It's been days since I've heard anyone speak, though surely someone must have said something in all that time, surely to fuck someone must have.
What's wrong, Allison?
Oh, fuck. Sick Boy reaches out to Allison.
It wasn't my baby. She wasn't my baby. Baby Dawn. She wasn't mine. Spud's? Swanney's? Sick Boy's? I don't know. Maybe Allison knew. Maybe not. I wished I could think of something to say, something sympathetic, something human.

I know a couple of addicts. Stupid wee lassies. I feed them what they need. A little bit of skag to keep them happy while the punters line up at a fiver a skull. It's easy money for me.

And see when I get out of here. I've got plans. Going to get myself straightened out and head off to Thailand, where women really know how to treat a guy. See, out there you can live like a king if you've got white skin and a few crisp tenners in your pocket. No fucking problem.

No. Well, yes. I have to admit it: I'm a perfectionist. For me, it's the best or nothing at all. If things go badly, I can't be bothered, but I have a good feeling about this interview.

Your threats amuse me, Captain Chekov. What consequences did you have in mind?
You are a master of understatement. They are likely to destroy the planet.
Then it's fortunate that I have you and your starship to protect me. In the meantime, Captain Chekov, I instruct you and your First Officer to beam down to my coordinates.

The Klingon, the Romulan, the Federation consuls. Now I know Enterprise is not exactly up to specs...

I think you gave me too much time, Captain.
Very well, Mr. Scott. Carry on.
Very well, Mr. Scott. Carry on.
Aye, Captain How many times do I have to tell you? The right tool for the right job...
Don't you worry, Captain. We'll beat those Klingon devils even if I have to get out and push.
I hope it won't come to that, Mr. Scott.
Scotty here, Captain. Transporter is still inoperative. Even if we could lock onto the hostages, we couldn't beam them up.
Then we'll have to get them out the old fashioned way.
Captain, we can't trust anyone now.
If we could send a distress signal...
Mr. Scott, get the transporter working. If we contact a rescue ship we'll need it. Which way to the turbo shaft?
Head down that tunnel to the hydro vent and turn right. Then left at the blowscreen. You can't miss it.

Mr. Scott, you're amazing.
She's got partial power, sir. I might be able to take two of you.
Beam up Spock and Dr. McCoy. Now!
Mr. Scott apologizes for having to send the shuttlecraft. The transporter beam is non-operational. Captain, we've received important orders from Starlet Command.
Why didn't you beep my communicator?
Why didn't you beep my communicator?
ER... You forgot to take it with you.
Captain, Starfleet transmission on line.
Put it on the veiwscreen, would You please?

Spock - What are you doing in this neck of the woods?
I'm flattered. Twelve hundred points of interest in Yosemite and you pick me.
I regret to inform you that the record for free-climbing El Captain is in no danger of being broken.
I'm not trying to break any records. I'm doing this because I enjoy it. Not to mention the most important reason for climbing a mountain...

MM.?
MM.?
I do not think you realize the gravity of your situation.
On the contrary. Gravity is foremost on my mind. Look, I'm trying to make an ascent here. Why don't you go pester Dr McCoy for a while?
I believe Dr McCoy is not in the best of moods.
Concentration is vital. You must be one with the rock.
Spock, I appreciate your concern, but if you don't stop distracting me, I'm liable to be one...
Oh, God
Perhaps "because it is there" is not sufficient reason for climbing a mountain.
Oh, no. It isn't that. I knew I wouldn't die because the two of you were with me.
I don't understand.
I don't understand.
I've always known... I'll die alone.
What are you doing?
I am preparing to toast a marsh melon.
Oh. I believe we are required to engage in a ritual known as the singalong.
That's great. I haven't sung around a campfire since I was a boy in Iowa. What are we going to sing? What... Bones, what are we going to sing?
"Pack Up Your Troubles."
Are we leaving, Captain?
"Row, row, row your boat..." I love "Row..." Do - do you know "Row, Row, Row, Row, Row Your Boat?"
That song did not come up in my research, Captain.
That song did not come up in my research, Captain.
The lyrics are - are very simple. It's, er, "Row, row, row your boat, gently down the stream. Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream.." The Doctor and I will start it off, and then when we give you the signal, you jump in. Doctor, if you please.
Come on, Spock. Why didn't you jump in?
I was trying to comprehend the meaning of the words.
Captain?
Spock, we're on leave. You can call me Jim.
Spock, we're on leave. You can call me Jim.
Jim.

Life is not a dream.

Go to sleep, Spock.

Goodnight, Bones.
Goodnight, Spock.
Goodnight, Doctor.
I could use a shower.
Yes.
Not General Korrd.

General Korrd's military strategies were required learning when I was a cadet at the Academy. When they put me out to pasture, I hope I fare better than Korrd.
What is it? You look like you've seen a ghost.
Perhaps I have, Captain. Perhaps I have.
Spock, what is it? Do you know this Vulcan?
I cannot be certain.
I cannot be certain.
But he does seem familiar?

He reminds me of someone I knew in my youth.
I do not often think of the past.
Who is it he reminds you of?
Who is it he reminds you of?
There was a young student, exceptionally gifted, possessing of great intelligence. It was assumed that one day he would take his place amongst the great scholars of Vulcan. But he was a revolutionary.

What do you mean?
What do you mean?
The knowledge and experience he sought were forbidden by Vulcan belief.
He rejected his logical upbringing and embraced the animal passions of our ancestors.
Why?
Why?
He believed the key to self-knowledge was emotion, not logic.
When he encouraged others to follow him, he was banished from Vulcan, never to return.
Fascinating.
Klingon vessel now entering quadrant. Bird of Prey. Estimating 1.9 hours until her weapons come to bear.
Damn. Let's go.
Their equipment is primitive but effective. I recommend we land at Coordinate 8563.
That puts us pretty far away from Paradise City.
That puts us pretty far away from Paradise City.
To land any closer would risk detection.

Mr. Sulu. Execute.
At footspeed I estimate the journey to Paradise City at 1.2 hours.
We don't have 1.2 hours.
Spock.
Yes, Captain?
Yes, Captain?
Be one with the horse.
Be one with the horse.
Yes, Captain.
Exactly 15.5 seconds.
An eternity during which we'll be vulnerable to Klingon attack. Korrd-you tell him.
You must allow us to act.
Let me do something.
Damnit, Spock. God damnit!
Captain, what have I done -
Captain, what have I done -
What you have done is betray every man on this ship.

Worse. I have betrayed you. I do not expect you to forgive me.
Worse. I have betrayed you. I do not expect you to forgive me.
Forgive you? I ought to knock you on your goddamn ass!
Forgive you? I ought to knock you on your goddamn ass!
If you think it would help.
You stay out of this! Why, Spock? Why? I.. All you had to do was pull the trigger.
If I had pulled the trigger, Sybok would be dead.

I ordered you to defend this ship.

Look, the man may be a fellow Vulcan, but that doesn't...

No, no, no, Captain. You do not understand. Sybok also in a son of Sarek.
You mean he's your brother brother? You made that up!
I did not.
I did not.
You did too. Sybok couldn't possibly be your brother because I happen to know for a fact that you don't have a brother.

Technically, you are correct. I do not have a brother.

There, you see? See?
There, you see? See?
I have a half brother.
I have a half brother.
I gotta sit down.
Exactly. That is correct. Sybok's mother was a Vulcan princess. Upon her death, Sybok and I were raised as brothers.
Why didn't you tell me this before?
Why didn't you tell me this before?
I was not disposed to discuss... matters of a personal nature. For that, I'm sorry.

There's got to be a way out of this place.
This is a new brig, Captain. It is escape-proof.

The designers tested it using the most intelligent and resourceful person they could find. He failed to escape.

Is it possible?

That he's found it. Sha Ka Ree. The reason Sybok left Vulcan.
There Sha Ka Ree is fabled to exist.
But the center of the galaxy can't be reached. No ship has ever gone into the Great Barrier. No probe has ever returned.

Sybok possessed the keenest intellect I have ever known.

Spock! My only concern is getting the ship back. When that's done and Sybok is in here then you can debate Sha Ka Ree until you're green in the face. Until then, you're either with me or you're not.

I am here, Captain.

That's a little vague, Spock -
You're right. I'm a little out of practice. Uh....that's an "s."
A "t."
A "t."
"a"... "n"...uh, "d"... end of word.
New word. "b".. "a"... um...
"c."... "k."
There is an emergency sending apparatus in the forward observation room.
The only problem is, it's up there. We're down here.
I believe I have found a faster way.
Hmmm?
Hmmm?
Uh-uh.
It would appear we are too heavy.
It must be all those marsh melons.
Spock... the booster rockets.
If I activate them now, Captain, we will be propelled upward at an unbelievable rate.
If I activate them now, Captain, we will be propelled upward at an unbelievable rate.
Fire the rockets!

The emergency channel, open.

To anyone within the sound of my voice: This is Captain James T. Kirk of the Federation Starship Enterprise. If you read me, acknowledge. Acknowledge.
...mark two.
Mark two. Request emergency assistance. Acknowledge.
Spock... don't.
It's all right, Captain. Proceed.
What is this?
I believe we are witnessing my birth.
Spock?
Welcome aboard, Captain.
Spock, I thought I was going to die.
Not possible. You were never alone.
Maybe he's not out there, Bones. Maybe he's right here... in the human heart Spock?
I was thinking of Sybok. I've lost a brother.
I was thinking of Sybok. I've lost a brother.
Yes. I lost a brother once. I was lucky. I got him back.
I must have your starship.
You staged all this to get your hands on my ship?
Who are you?
James T. Kirk, Captain of the Enterprise.
James T. Kirk, Captain of the Enterprise.
But I thought Captain Chekov.. I see. Very clever, Captain. Spock, it would appear that you've been given a second chance to join me. What do you say?
No! No reply. Remain on course.
Sybok, listen to me. In order for this craft to enter the landing bay, Enterprise must lower the shields and activate the tractor beam. To get us inside and re-raise the shields will take-
What are you doing?
In order to lower and raise the shields as quickly as possible, we're going to forego the tractor beam and fly her in manually.
We must change our course at once.
I'll take you to the bridge.
I trust your message was received?
You can't expect us to stand by while you take the ship into the Great Barrier.
You can't expect us to stand by while you take the ship into the Great Barrier.
What you fear is the unknown. The people of your planet once believed their world was flat. Columbus proved it was round. They said the sound barrier could never be broken. It was broken. They said warp speed could not be achieved. The Great Barrier is the ultimate expression of this universal fear. It's an extension of personal fear. Captain Kirk, I so much

I'm afraid of nothing.
Sha Ka Ree. "The Scource." "Heaven." "Eden." call it "Qui'Tu." To the Romulans, it's "Vorta Vor." The Andorian word is.. unpronounceable. Still, every culture shares he common dream of a place from which creation sprang. For us, that place will soon be a reality.
The only realty I see is that I'm a prisoner on my own ship. What is this power you have to control the minds of my crew?

I don't control minds. I free them.
Spock... What have you done to my friends?
I've done nothing. This is who they are. Didn't you know that?
No... I didn't.
Now learn something about yourself.
Now learn something about yourself.
No. I refuse.
Wait! You know we'll never make it through the Great Barrier.
But if we do, will that convince you that my vision was true?

Oh, I cannot leave her now when she needs me the most.

I had a feeling you would say something like that. So I brought us dinner.
They can't be serious. The ship's in pieces and we've less than a skeleton aboard.
Starfleet, are you aware of our currant status?
Easy, easy, easy, Scotty. Easy. You're back with us.
Uhura, I had the strangest dream. I dreamt that a madman had taken over the Enterprise.

He's not?
He's not?
No. Sybok has simply put us in touch with feelings we've always been afraid to express.
No, no, no. Scotty - Scotty... There's so much I want to tell you.
Maybe you could wait until I'm a wee bit stronger I don't think I could take it in my present condition. Or yours.
Spock, you've developed a sense of humor after all.
It was not my intention to amuse you. These are serious charges. However, if you surrender now-
It was not my intention to amuse you. These are serious charges. However, if you surrender now-
I'm sorry, Spock. I can't surrender now. I'm not through violating Neutral Zone Treaty. In fact, I'm just getting started. And now for my next violation I intend to steal something. Something very big.
I am a Starfleet Officer.
Of course. Of course. Then I'll take the ship without your help.
Sybok, you must surrender.
No. You must kill me.
Put him in the brig with Captain Kirk. Spock, you will accompany me to the bridge?
No. I will not.
No. I will not.
You know I'm right.
Each man's pain is unique.
I hide no pain.

I know you better than that.

Why not?

I belong here.

I don't understand...

Sybok, you are my brother, but you do not know me. I am not the outcast boy you left behind those many years ago. Since that time I have found myself and my place. I know who I am. And I cannot go with you.
Sybok - this is not the God of Sha Ka Ree - or any other God!
I don't understand.. Reveal yourself to me!
Sybok.
This is my doing. This is my arrogance... my vanity...

Sybok, we must find a way...

You haven't told him?
Sherman, set the Wayback Machine for...oh, 1973. Kevin Flynn is one of the brightest young software engineers at ICOM. He's so bright that he starts going in there at night, and sets up a private memory file, and begins writing a program for a video game he is inventing, called... ...Space Paranoids.
You invented Space Paranoids?

Yepper. And Vice Squad, and Meltdown... whole slew of 'em. I was this close to starting my own little enterprise. But: enter Ed Dillinger.

I still don't get why you're trying to break into the system.
I still don't get why you're trying to break into the system.
Because somewhere... in one of those memories ... is the evidence. If I got in far enough, I could reconstruct it.
Dillinger?
Yeah. Tryin' to find the file and erase it. Once that's gone, ain't nothin' can stop him. Just Eddie and his Master Control Program, runnin' things from on high..
Not if my Tron program was running. That would seal the system off. If your file's in there...
Boy, if we were inside, I know how to forge us a Group 6 access...
Hi, Alan.
Hi, Flynn.
My dinner.
I was wondering where you got that glow of good health.
I was wondering where you got that glow of good health.
Want one?

Uh... got any cinnamon?
Flynn! I made it. I worked out some new codes for Tron, put 'em on a disk, and -- it's running.
I know, I met him.
Your old files -- ?
And Dillinger's instructions to divert them -- it's all there - look, even his home phone number, when he logged on.

Oh, that is beautiful. You've got the goods...
Shouldn't you wait till your lawsuit's settled?
Nah...I decided...I've had enough of video games to last me a good long time. I feel like gettin' into some real life...
How's it going upstairs?
Frustrating. I had Tron almost ready to run, and Dillinger cut everybody with Group 7 access out of the system.
Did you say Group 7 access?
Yeah...pain in the neck, you know, I was all set
Yeah...pain in the neck, you know, I was all set

I don't think I'm cleared for this.
I'm certainly not.
Beautiful!
Hello, Alan.
Hello, Alan.
Boy, I sit up there grindin' away all day, and you guys are down here disintegrating things and having fun.
Not disintegrating, Alan -- digitizing. While the laser is dismantling the molecular structure of the object, the computer maps out a holographic model of it. The molecules themselves are suspended in the laser beam. Then the computer reads the model back out, the molecules go back into place, and... voila.
Great. Can it send me to Hawaii?
Great. Can it send me to Hawaii?
Yes...but you have to go roundtrip, and you must purchase your program at least 30 days in advance. Hah!
Ever since he got that Master Control Program set up, system's got more bugs than a bait store.
Well, you have to expect some static. Computers are just machines after all, they can't think...

Come on in...
Alan. Alan Bailey.
Alan. Alan Bailey.
Oh, yes. The algorithms on cloud seeding...great piece of work. How's it going?
Well, I don't know...I just tried to run this program I've been working on, and I was denied access all of a sudden. I thought maybe I'd been laid off and nobody told me.
oh, you have Group 7 access, don't you?

We have to close that down, just briefly. Security reasons. Someone with that access has been tampering.

No, no, I'm sure, but -- you understand. It should only be a couple of days. What's the thing you're working on?
No, no, I'm sure, but -- you understand. It should only be a couple of days. What's the thing you're working on?
It's called Tron. It's a security program itself, actually. Monitors all the contacts between our system and other systems... If it finds anything going on that's not scheduled, it shuts it down. I sent you a memo on it.

This honey doesn't handle so good in town...
No, nuh-uh, never in a million years!
This town's full o' live ones.
Not a chance.
You said it.
So... Nice ship you got here. What's our next move?
Yes!
Let's get outta here.
No problem, Master-C. If you've seen one Consumer Electronics Show... What's up?

So do as I tell you. Keep that Tron program out of the system. And get me those Chinese language program I asked for.
Ed, all I'm saying is - if our own people can't get access to their programs ... you know how frustrating it is, when you're working on a piece of research -

Hmm. A difficult proposition... difficult proposition at best. Perhaps you've noticed... we're not exactly packing them in these days ...
Well I want to communicate --
Oh, you want to -- hah. I could get myself de-rezzed just-for letting you in here. They hate this tower. They'd close it down if they dared to but they keep me around, in case one of them wants to deal with the other world once in a while. And you should hear the way they commune! Sounds like they were routing a payroll,
Dumont... my User has information that could -- could make this a free system again.

I feel like hittin' him now, while I'm good an' mad. Some nerve... what does he care whether you guys get killed, long as he keeps rakin' in quarters?
What's that?
Tanks...coming back. Let's go.
How about over there...that empty memory?
No good...they might block off the old chip. This way.

Greetings, program...

You're alive!

Yeah, I... oops!

I'm sorry, Tron... he's... he didn't make it.
No big deal. I ought to know my way around that Light Cycles routine... I mean, I did write the program for it.
Wrote the...?

It's time I levelled with you, Tron. I'm a -- well, I'm what you guys call a User.

Stranger and stranger...
We're on our way. Alan-One gave me the coding we need to go up against Master
All right. Thank God. Alan stayed awake, at least.
What about our friend - Sark?
Probably decided not to pursue us, The Sea of Simulation is tricky.. lot of illusions...rough navigating. Programs have a way of just... disappearing here.

Not us, I hope.
Not us, I hope.
Not with this disk. I'm going to check on the beam connection, Yori. You two can keep a watch out for grid bugs.
Did we make it?
Yes.
Hey... you guys OK?
How about you?
How about you?
Aah, I'm fine... little hung over is all...
A User -- in our world?
Guess I took a wrong turn somewhere...
Boy the view from up here... you know the territory?
A little ... Over there, the Mountains of Data... and I think that's the Silicon Valley...
A little ... Over there, the Mountains of Data... and I think that's the Silicon Valley...
What's wrong with that area?
The MCP blasted it... There are very few domains left with any power at all.
Lousy utility companies ... they're the same wherever you go.
There's another beam!
It's too far!
How did you do that, Flynn?
Elementary physics... a beam of energy can always be diverted... ooh, my head Are we there yet, Mommy?
Elementary physics... a beam of energy can always be diverted... ooh, my head Are we there yet, Mommy?
Almost... I just have to adjust our course at the next junction. I'd better go check the instruments ...
Flynn, we've got to help him!
Let's get some power here.
Yori, steer us over the beam, right next to it.
Why? What are you going to do?
Why? What are you going to do?
Jump.
But... won't you be de-rezzed?
Probably.
Flynn... you can't... I
Shhhhh.
You'll be having plenty of chances to get hurt, don't worry about that.
Look...just so I can tell my friends what this dream was about, okay? Where am I?

Well, great, that's no sweat -- I play video games better than anybody.
Hey, Ram ... what were you ... you know, before?
Oh, I was an actuarial program... worked at a big insurance company. It really gives you a great feeling, helping folks plan for their future needs -- and of course, if you look at the payments as an annuity, over the years, the cost is really

Yeah, yeah -- that's great.
Yeah, yeah -- that's great.
How 'bout yourself?
How 'bout yourself?
Oh, uh...I don't remember too much...
Oh, uh...I don't remember too much...
Sure, a little disorientation. That's normal, when they transport you. It'll come back to you. You're doing real well in training. Remarkable, really...
Flynn! Look, Tron, he survived!
Tron...?
He was disoriented in transport, Tron.
Yeah, but I'm remembering all kinds of stuff. Like...my User wants me to go after the MCP
Watch it!
Recognizers!
It's all circuits... Must be an input/output component...
The tower, yes -- Flynn, have you remembered anything else about yourself -- like what sector you're from?

It grows on you.
Feel what? You okay?
Alan-One...
What's goin' on?
We're inside a Recognizer... You are crazy -- stealing a Recognizer --
We're inside a Recognizer... You are crazy -- stealing a Recognizer --
Are you kidding? I think it's stealing us -
Damn! Never fails... minute the warranty runs out...
Come here.
Hey... !
Little more juice's all it needs...
Hey! Good to see you guys! Nothing classes up the place like a cleancut young couple.
We have to talk.
We have to talk.
Good luck. You can't even think in here.
So...how's the world of serious science?
Have you been sneaking into the ICOM system?
Have you been sneaking into the ICOM system?
Whew. You never were much for small talk. She still leave her clothes all over the floor?
You can see why all his friends are fourteen years old.
Touche, honey. Yeah, I've been doing a little hacking here. Which I've got every reason, as you well know...
I'm afraid it's a little late for that. Dillinger's shut off Group 7 access. He must know what you're up to.
Boy, I bet I know who's workin' late tonight.
Don't even say that. You've got to find that file before he does..
Not much chance of that now. The MCP can just slip it into another system as soon as it locates it...
Okay ... Flynn, I'm gonna put you at my terminal, down in the laser lab. We'll be up in Alan's office.
Swell...I'll log us both on, and you can get your Tron thing running...
Swell...I'll log us both on, and you can get your Tron thing running...
As long as we stay off the top floor, Dillinger'll never know we've been in here...
you have any idea how much I can sue these jokers for?
Well, just don't forget your old friends when you're rich and famous.
Well, just don't forget your old friends when you're rich and famous.
Are you kidding? You guys'll he running this joint by then...
Hey, you know anybody who wants to get hold of some video games... cheap?
You're getting out of the business?
Thank. you, Master Control.
We might be capturing some military programs soon... that interest you?

Strategic Air Command.
Yes, MCP.
I've got a little challenge for you, Sark -- a new recruit. He's a tough case, but I want him treated in the usual manner. Train him for the games... let him hope for a while... and blow him away.

You've got it. I've been hopin' you'd send me somebody with a little moxie ... what kind of program is he?
You've got it. I've been hopin' you'd send me somebody with a little moxie ... what kind of program is he?
He's not any kind of program, Sark. He's a User.
A User?
That's right. He pushed me...in the other world. Somebody pushes me, I push back. So I brought him down here ... What's the matter, Sark? You look nervous.
Well, I -- it's just -- I don't know, a User, I mean... Users wrote us. A User even wrote you...
Now get this straight, pal -- no one User wrote me. I'm worth a couple million of their man-years! I'm bigger than all those little wimps put together! Humans they can't even keen their social order in one piece
Now get this straight, pal -- no one User wrote me. I'm worth a couple million of their man-years! I'm bigger than all those little wimps put together! Humans they can't even keen their social order in one piece
But-what if I can't...?
But-what if I can't...?
You rather take your chances with me? Want me to slow down your power cycles for you?
Wait...I need that...
Then pull yourself together. Get this clown trained. I want him in the Games until he dies playing.
Yes...acknowledge, Master Control...
End of line.
I hope you've enjoyed being a command program, Sark. I wonder how you'll like working in a pocket calculator... maybe one of those watches that plays "Happy Birthday" to its User once a year.
Now, sir... We did take care of that User you sent us --
Now, sir... We did take care of that User you sent us --
Yes, and now you've got two renegade programs running all the hell over the system in a stolen simulation.

We'll get them, sir... These things take time.

The Users...you really think they're still there?
The Users...you really think they're still there?
They'd better be...I don't want to bust outta this dump an' find nothin' but a lot of cold circuits waitin' for me.
What do you think?
Do it!
You think we can make it there?
We have to.
Do you know what he's talking about?
I have to find out what Alan wants... that comes first.
Yori... hey...
Oh, Tron... I knew you'd escape... they've never built circuit that could hold you...
I can't believe how bad it's gotten around here since the MCP started taking over... all the good functions have shut down... everybody looks so dead... I'm afraid to even go out during down-time...
That's all going to change, Yori...
That's all going to change, Yori...
How?
How?
Don't know yet... I have to get in touch with Alan. He was going to tell me how to
My quarters.
Why is everything...like this?
Why is everything...like this?
It's a flat. But wait a micro...
You've grown, big program.
I had to...in the games...
Yes...it can take us across the Sea of Simulation... all the way out of the Game Grid...to the MCP.
As long as it gets us out of here
This is Flynn... the one who busted me out.
Then I owe you some thanks...
What is it?
Power surge... the transmission beam's too strong!
Power surge... the transmission beam's too strong!
We have to get off this beam!
We have to get off this beam!
I can't. There's no junction due for at least 7 or 8 nanoseconds!
Nice...
It's something Users do.
It's something Users do.
Where's Flynn?
I mean, it's not like he's saving the world or anything. He's a sales rep for Chrissakes. Whenever I can't get to sleep I ask him to tell me about his day. Six seconds and I'm out. But he acts like he's curing cancer or something.
So I guess you didn't get away * for the weekend after all? *

Helen! It's your mystery man.
Simon? Ohmygod.
Can you cover me for an hour?
Just an hour? You should tell this stud to take more time.
Just an hour? You should tell this stud to take more time.
Will you shutup. I should never have told you about him.
Where are you going?
Out. If Dad doesn't care enough about us to be here on his birthday, then why should I care? I'm going to a movie.
Out. If Dad doesn't care enough about us to be here on his birthday, then why should I care? I'm going to a movie.
No you're not. You're going to stay here until your father gets home and have cake!
No you're not. You're going to stay here until your father gets home and have cake!
Mom, wake up! Dad barely knows we exist.
That's not true, honey--
It is true! He doesn't know anything about me. He still thinks I'm like ten years old or something. As long as I just smile and say yes to whatever he says, like his good little fantasy daughter, he thinks everything's fine. But it's not fine. Nothing's fine.
Dinner's in the warmer. Tell your father I may be late.
Where are you going?
Where are you going?
Out.
I'm done.
Where are you off to young lady?
Where are you off to young lady?
I have a book report.
Dana, Mr. Hardy called. Why weren't you in class today?
He lies! I was there! I was in the nurse's office, cause I had a headache.
He lies! I was there! I was in the nurse's office, cause I had a headache.
You seem fine now.

Great! You're going to believe that fat dweeb Mr. Hardy over your own daughter.
Great! You're going to believe that fat dweeb Mr. Hardy over your own daughter.
I'm not sure what to believe anymore, young lady. You never used to lie to me. But lately you don't seem to know the difference between right and wrong.
Dana, are you listening to me?
Yeah, Dad.
Yeah, Dad.
You know you can always talk to me. Right? Whatever is going on in your life, your mom and I'll understand.
You know you can always talk to me. Right? Whatever is going on in your life, your mom and I'll understand.
Okay, Dad.
Okay, Dad.
You'd tell me if there was something wrong, wouldn't you, pumpkin?
You'd tell me if there was something wrong, wouldn't you, pumpkin?
I'm not a pumpkin! Okay?!! Do I look even remotely like a pumpkin?! I'm not a muffin, or a cupcake or a honeybear either! And you don't understand anything Dad...
How was school today?
Fine.
There are going to be some changes Dana. You're going to start following some rules. And I'm going to be there to see that you do.
Yeah, right.
Yeah, right.
You're going to stay in school. Do you understand?
You're going to stay in school. Do you understand?
Why? So I can wind up like you? What's the point?
Dad, how come you know the words?
Honey that song came out in 1968, when I was exactly your age.
Honey that song came out in 1968, when I was exactly your age.
Unbelievable! Trent told me he wrote it. He's history.
I seem to remember something about a history project that's due tomorrow.
Dad. You just think you know everything, don't you?
And this is a little above market- * rate for the horizontal bop, even * for a total biscuit like her.
Alright, I want a complete workup on her. Do we know where she is?
Alright, I want a complete workup on her. Do we know where she is?
Uh huh. Right here in river city.
Uh huh. Right here in river city.
You're kidding.
You're kidding.
She lives in Rome, but she does stuff here the Smithsonian and has a lot of diplomatic connections, so she has offices * here. *
And the second you left there, we started getting calls to the * ghost numbers. They were checking out the Renquist front.
Okay. Let's step up the surveillance on her. Put on two more guys.
Immediate roll. Acquire subject at K Street and Key Bridge. * Vehicle is red-and-white * convertible. You have six minutes.
Roger, One. Rolling.
Faisil. You're new on Harry's team, aren't you?
Yes.
Yes.
So what makes you think that the slack I cut him in any way translates to you?!

Switching to sub-vocal. Gib, you copy?
It's Talkradio. You're on the air.
Harry! Where are you!
In the helicopter.
Harry? HARRY?!
What?
What's this for?
For Dana, schmuck. Bring your kid something. You know. The dad thing.
For Dana, schmuck. Bring your kid something. You know. The dad thing.
Got it. Nice touch. Okay, pick me up at eight. The de-brief is at ten hundred.
What a team. See you at eight.
Yep. Sleep fast.
Thanks dear.
Here, check these out.
Son of a bitch!
What?
Kids. Ten seconds of joy. Thirty years of misery.
She knows not to steal. I've taught her better than that.
She knows not to steal. I've taught her better than that.
Yeah, but you're not her parents, anymore, you and Helen. Her parents are Axl Rose and Madonna. The five minutes you spend a day with her can't compete with that kind of constant bombardment. You're outgunned, amigo.
See, kids now are ten years ahead * of where we were at the same age. You probably think she's still a virgin--
Don't be ridiculous. She's only -- how old is she?
Don't be ridiculous. She's only -- how old is she?
Fourteen, Harry.
Fourteen, Harry.
Right. She's only fourteen.
Uh huh. And her little hormones are going like a fire alarm. I * say even money that physicist on * the bike is boinkin' her. *
No way. Not Dana.
Okay. Okay. De-nail ain't just a river in Egypt. She's probably stealing the money to pay for an abortion.
Will you just open the door! *
Twenty here, fifty there... I figured my wife's boyfriend was taking it.
I thought you moved out.
I thought you moved out.
Well . . . I moved back in. My lawyer said it would give me a better claim on the house in the property settlement. Don't change the subject... you owe me two hundred bucks.
Harry Tasker. One zero zero two four.
Albert Gibson. Three four nine nine one.
You better watch it. She might file on you for sexual harassment.
In her dreams.
It doesn't mean anything. She buys antiquities for Khaled.
Nope. The art buys are in a separate ledger.
It's all set up... ghost phones and fax, all the usual stuff. You have a suite at the Marquis Hotel under Renquist. Okay, reality check. Go.
Hi, I'm Harry Renquist. I own a--
She's importing stuff from all over the mid-east.
She could be moving money, guns. Anything.
What? It's on the way. She says she's got something for me.
Yeah, right.
Station wagon?
Uh huh. Want me to lose them?
Helen's going to be pissed.
See, that's the problem with terrorists. They're really inconsiderate when it comes to people's schedules.
What's the plan?
Gonna try to get a closer shot of * Beavis & Butthead. *
There's another guy, still in the car.
Stay on him.
Copy that.
And make it fast. My horse is getting tired.
Hey, did that guy Harry chased last night call in to give himself up yet? Cause apparently that's the only way we're going to catch the son of a bitch --
Okay. Here she comes.
Look at the way the little punk is driving. He's all over the place. Look-- he hasn't signalled once.
Goddammit! That's outrageous.
So, you wanna play huh? You little--
That's it. Get 'im Harry We'll teach that little puke not to signal.
Ha! The little prick ditched you! That is so goddamn funny.
Son of a bitch!
Son of a bitch!
Can we go to the office now, Mr. Superspy?
Abu Kaleem Malik.
Hardcore, highly fanatical, ultra- * fundamentalist. Linked to * numerous car-bombings, that cafe * bomb in Rome, and the 727 out of Lisbon last year. Major player. *
Look, uh... I've got to talk to Helen about this thing with Dana. I'm just going to run in and see if she can get away for lunch.
You want me to just hang-- ?
You want me to just hang-- ?
Just hang a minute.
Just hang a minute.
I'll just hang then, shall I?
He-- Helen. Helen-- it's Helen. It's Helen, Gib.
Something to do with Helen, is what I'm getting.
Something to do with Helen, is what I'm getting.

What're you talking about? We have that.

Helen's phone. Her office line and the line at my house.
Yeah, and we do it twenty times a day. Don't give me that crap. Just put on the taps. Now.
Sure, Harry. I'm on it.

Yeah, but for who? *
Yeah, but for who? *

Goddamnit, Harry. This is our butts. So your life is in the toilet. So your wife is banging a used car salesman. Sure it's humiliating. But be a man here--

She's lying.
You didn't have sexual relations with him?

Wait! Calm down, Mrs. Tasker. There is only one more question.
Now what?
There is only one solution to your problem, Mrs. Tasker. You must work for us.
There is only one solution to your problem, Mrs. Tasker. You must work for us.
Oh shit. Harry... what're you doing?
Oh shit. Harry... what're you doing?
I'm giving her an assignment. I am offerring you a choice. If you work for us we will drop the charges and you can go back to your normal life. If not, you will go to federal prison, and your husband and daughter will be left humiliated and alone. Your like will be destroyed.
We're dead, right? So... where'd you put the transmitter?
In her Walkman. It's the one thing I knew she'd be taking.
You've reached a new low with this one. I can't believe you're crazy enough to use the room at the Marquis.
Why not? You think I can afford a suite like that on my salary? Is Jean-Claude done yet? *
I thought this look like your work.
Let's go. I'll brief you in the air.
Let's go. I'll brief you in the air.
You're welcome.
--you tell the son of bitch this is Bright Boy Alert. Repeat, a Bright Boy Alert. And I need a patch of the White House ASAP. That's right--
... the Coast Guard has to clear them back to a twenty mile radius. Anybody that can't make the minimum safe distance we need an airlift on, immediately--
I can get 3 Marine Corps Harriers here in about 12 minutes. They're on maneuvers out of Boca Chica.
Get 'em. I'll brief them on the way in.
... well get the Highway Patrol to go through the streets and tell everybody on their damn loudspeakers. Just the basics... get away from windows, don't look at it... yeah--
Here they come.
Any minute now.
It's show time. Don't look at * the flash. Do not look at the flash.
I'd like to remind you that it has been ten years since you were actually in one of these.
If I break it they can take it out of my pay.
He's got it.
Sorry.
I should have gone to the police, I suppose.
But you didn't. Why not?
But you didn't. Why not?
I don't know. I guess... I wanted to see what would happen.
Is this a common thing for you? Cheating?
No! Never!
No! Never!
So, it was your first time.
So, it was your first time.
I wasn't cheating!
My husband is a good man.
But he's not exactly ringing your bell lately, right? I mean--
Look, if you ask me everything twice, this is going to take a really long time. And I have to get home to my family.
You're not going anywhere.
Janice, how many years have you been buzzing us in?
Ten, Mr. Gibson.
Ten, Mr. Gibson.
And you still reach for your piece every time.

I'd like that.
Well, what's the point of waiting?
I agree.
So your clients want something for the lobby of their new corporate headquarters?
That's right. They want something... dramatic. I spoke to a number of people who said you're the one to see.
Let's see... that you can read ancient Sanskrit without having to sound out the words. And that other dealers and archeologists don't like you much.
Those wimps. It's because I use * my diplomatic contacts to export cultural treasures from countries which tell them to take a hike. I told you to move those crates an hour ago. Come on guys, let's get going.
Do you like my tomb? The museum * financing fell out, so I thought * your clients might be interested.
It's certainly... dramatic.

Especially in this light. This is the only light they had then, * so I like to study it this way. I love this place. I love all ruins.

Is that why you got into this business?
I've always been a collector at heart. When I see something I want, I have to have it.
And you have a reputation as someone who gets what she wants.
Yes.
Yes what?

Uh, yes, it is important.
Hello, Harry.
Juno. I wish I could say it's a pleasure to see you again.
This is Samir. See if you can guess his specialty.
Oral hygiene?
Oral hygiene?
Not exactly.
You think I care about their * cause? Or yours? Not at all. * See, America is on top now . . * . but so was Rome, once. All * civilizations crumble. One nation succeeding over another. What does it mean in the long run? The only important thing is to live well. And... living * well takes money. *
You're damaged goods, lady.
Did you tell her about us, Harry?
There is no us, you psychotic bitch.
There is no us, you psychotic bitch.
Sure. Say that now.
Hi, honey. How was the flight?
Fine, honey. Stay asleep.
Fine, honey. Stay asleep.
Okay.
I'm late.
Me too.
How'd it go at the trade show? You make all the other salesmen jealous?
Yeah. You should have seen it. We were the hit of the show with the new model ordering system, the one for the 680... how you can write up an order and the second the customer's name goes into the computer, it starts checking their credit, and if they've ordered anything in the past, and if they get a discount...
That's fabulous Harry.
Yeah, it was wild.

Hi honey. What's going on? *

Baby, I said I'd be there. Really. Trust me. Gotta go, honey. Bye bye.

It's okay, don't bother, Harry.
I'm sorry. Thank you for the party.
Yeah. It was great.
Come on to bed, you don't have to brush your teeth.
I'll just be a second. So what happened tonight at the office?
I'll just be a second. So what happened tonight at the office?
I couldn't believe it. I go back to get this report I need, right, and the phone is ringing, so like a bonehead I answer it--
It's the big client in Japan, and it's the middle of the morning there and their whole system is crashed... this guy's having a meltdown--
What'd you do, honey?
What'd you do, honey?
Well I pull out the manual on their setup, which is the new 680 server...
...and I'm troubleshooting it with them over the phone... talking to a translator, right, who's getting half of it wrong... it was unbelievable... really wild.
It sounds wild. So now you're a big hero, right? For fixing their system.

They said you had to run out.

Yeah. It was a rush thing. They needed some documents down at the court house. I barely made it.
So, a little excitement in an otherwise dull day. Did is work out okay?
Oh, sure. Fine. I'll get some more gravy.
I thought we might have lunch tomorrow.
I can't, honey. I promised Allison I'd go shopping with her. Sorry.
How long have you been a member of his faction?
I don't know anything about a faction. I just met Simon... or whatever his name is... a couple of weeks ago. I barely know him.
What did happen?
Three days later, he called me. He told me to meet him at Overlook Park.
Why did you continue to see him?
He needed my help.

That's none of your goddamn business! What kind of questions are these?
You're in a lot of trouble, Mrs. Tasker, so I suggest you cooperate. If we want to know the most intimate details of your life, you'd better tell us.
Let me handle this part. Do you mind? Why did you go to Carlos' hideout?
He wanted me to go with him on a mission, to pose as him wife.

What's going on, Harry?
Samir is just going to ask Harry a few questions. See, we're not even sure which agency Harry works for. Now, Samir is absolutely first class, but on the other hand we have Harry, here, who has managed to lie convincingly to the woman he loves for 15 years. So it will be interesting to see how long he can resist.

I'm hip. But you know, I'm comfortable here. It's easy work. I know what I'm doing. Everybody who works here is my buddy. I'm friendly with most of the customers. I just hang around and talk about comic books all day.

You bet. How much is that worth?
Four hundred bucks.
I didn't even know they had stores that just sold comic books.
I didn't even know they had stores that just sold comic books.
Well, we sell other things too. Cool stuff. "Man from U.N.C.L.E." Lunch boxes. "Green Hornet" board games. Shit like that. But comic books are main business. There's a lot of collectors around here.
What's that?
That's a "Rookies" doll. George Sanford Brown. We gotta lotta dolls. They're real cool. Did you know they came out with dolls for all the actors in "The Black Hole"? I always found it funny somewhere there's a kid playin' with a little figure of Earnest Borgnine.
God, Spiderman looks different.
He was just born, remember? This is the first one. You know that guy, Dr. Gene Scott? He said that the story of Spiderman is the story of Christ, just disguised. Well, I thought about that even before I heard him say it. Hold on, let me show you my favorite comic book cover of all time.
Oooooh, you look so cute in your little cowboy outfit. How old were you then?
Five.
Oh, you look so cute as little Elvis.
I finally knew what I wanted when I grew up.
You know when you sat behind me?
At the movies?

Uh-huh, I was tryin' to think of somethin' to say to you, then I thought, she doesn't want me bothering her.

I love Janis.
You know, a lot of people have misconceptions of how she died.

She OD'd, didn't she?
She OD'd, didn't she?
Yeah, she OD'd. But wasn't on her last legs or anythin'. She didn't take too much. It shouldn't have killed her. There was somethin' wrong with what she took.

You mean she got a bad batch?
You mean she got a bad batch?
That's what happened. In fact, when she died, it was considered to be the happiest time of her life. She'd been fucked over so much by men she didn't trust them. She was havin' this relationship with this guy and he asked her to marry him. Now, other people had asked to marry her before, but she couldn't be sure whether they really loved

I don't know. I didn't talk with them. The plan was for me to bump into you, pick you up, spend the night, and skip out after you fell asleep.

It's over on the TV. All it says is: "Dear Clarence." I couldn't write anymore. I didn't not want to ever see you again. In fact, it's stupid not to ever see you again. Las night... I don't know...

Well, I wouldn't go so far as to call him nice, but he's treated me pretty decent. But I've only been there about four days. He got a little rough with Arlene the other day.

Goddamn it, Alabama, you gotta get the fuck outta there! How much longer before he's slappin' you around? Punchin' you in the stomach? How the fuck did you get hooked up with a douche-bag like this in the first place?
At the bus station. He said I'd be a perfect call girl. And that he knew an agency in California that, on his recommendation, would handle me. They have a very exclusive clientele: movie stars, big businessmen, total white-collar. And all the girls in the agency get a grand a night. At least five hundred. They drive Porsches, live in condos, have stockbrokers, carry

So I can go over there and pick up your things.
So I can go over there and pick up your things.
No, Clarence. Just forget it, babe. I just wanna disappear from there.
Look, sweetheart, he scares you. But I'm not scared of that motherfucker. He can't touch you now. You're completely out of his reach. He poses absolutely no threat to us. So, if he doesn't matter, which he doesn't, it would be stupid to lose your things, now wouldn't it?
You don't know him -
You don't know him -
You don't know me. Not when it comes to shit like this. I have to do this. I need for you to know you can count on me to protect you. Now write down the address.
Was it him or you?
Yeah. But to be honest, I put myself in that position. When I drove up there I said to myself, "If I can kill 'em and get away with it, I'll do it." I could. So I did.
Yeah. But to be honest, I put myself in that position. When I drove up there I said to myself, "If I can kill 'em and get away with it, I'll do it." I could. So I did.
Is this a joke?

No joke. This is probably the best hamburger I've ever had. I'm serious, I've never had a hamburger taste this good.
I think what you did was...
What?
What?
I think what you did...
I think what you did...
What?

... was so romantic.
Do you want some wine, sweetheart?
Nope. I'm not really a wine gal.
You did it, Quickdraw. I'm so proud of you. You were like a ninja. Did I do my part OK?
Babalouey, you were perfect, I could hardly keep from busting up.

I'm gonna hop in the tub and get all wet, and slippery, and soapy. Then I'm gonna lie in the waterbed, not even both to dry off, and watch X-rated movies till you get your ass back to my lovin' arms.
Ya know, I used to fuckin' hate airports.
Really?
Really?
With a vengeance, I hated them.
With a vengeance, I hated them.
How come?
How come?
I used to live by one back in Dearborn. It's real frustratin' to be surrounded by airplanes when you ain't got shit. I hated where I was, but I couldn't do anythin' about it. I didn't have enough money. It was tough enough just tryin' to pay my rent every month, an' here I was livin' next to an airport. Whenever I went outside,

Leavin' Detroit. Goin' off on vacations, startin' new lives, business trips. Fun, fun, fun, fun.
But knowin' me and you gonna be nigger-rich gives me a whole new outlook. I love airports now. Me 'n' you can get on any one of those planes out there, and go anywhere we ant.
You ain't kiddin', we got lives to start over, we should go somewhere where we can really start from scatch.

It's got a nice ring to it. It sounds like a movie. "Clarence and Alabama Go to Cancoon". Don't 'cha think?
But in my movie, baby, you get the top billing.
I thought it was what you wanted, Clarence.
It is what I want. But I don't want to spend the next ten years in jail. I don't want you guys to go to jail. We don't know what could be waiting for us up there. It'll probably be just what it's supposed to be. The only thing that's waiting for us is two hundred thousand dollars. I'm just looking at the downside.
It's been fun thinking about the money but I can walk away from it, honey.
That rhymes.
What the fuck are you talkin' about?
Floyd say he don't be eatin' pussy.

Hold on a second, Big D. You sayin' you eat pussy?
Nigger, I eat everything. I eat pussy. I eat the butt. I eat every motherfuckin' thang.
Go on pussy-eaters... laugh. You look like you be eatin' pussy. You got pussy-eatin' mugs. Now if a nigger wants to get his dick sucked he's got to do a bunch of fucked-up shit.
So you do eat pussy!
So you do eat pussy!
Naw naw!

If I thought I could get away with it -
If I thought I could get away with it -
Killin' 'em's the hard part. Gettin' away with it's the easy part. Whaddaya think the cops do when a pimp's killed? Burn the midnight oil tryin' to find who done it? They couldn't give a flyin' fuck if all the pimps in the whole wide world took two in the back of the fuckin' head. If you don't get caught at the scene with
Clarence, I gotta hand it to ya. You were cooler than cool.

That was cool, wasn't it? You know, I don't even know where that came from. I just opened my mouth and it came out. After I said it I thought, that's a cool line, I gotta remember that.
How do you think I'm doin' with Lee?
Are you kiddin'? He loves you.
Are you kiddin'? He loves you.
You don't think I'm kissin' his ass, do you?

I'm not lyin' to him. I mean it. I loved "Coming Home in a Body Bag".
I'm not lyin' to him. I mean it. I loved "Coming Home in a Body Bag".
That's why it doesn't come across as ass-kissin', because it's genuine, and he can see that.
Where the fuck is that bitch?
She's with me.
She's with me.
Who the fuck are you?
Who the fuck are you?
I'm her husband.
I'm her husband.
Well. That makes us practically related. Bring your ass on in.
Grab a seat there, boy. Want some dinner? Grab yourself an egg roll. We got everything here from a diddle-eyed-Joe to a damned-if-I-know.
No thanks.
No thanks.
No thanks? What does that mean? Means you ate before you came down here? All full. Is that it? Naw, I don't think so. I think you're too scared to be eatin'. Now, see we're sittin' down here, ready to negotiate, and you've already given up your shit. I'm still a mystery to you. But I know exactly where your ass is comin' from.
Wannabee nigger...
Fuck you! My mother was Apache.

I'm a married man.
I'm a married man.
Get the fuck outta here!

Believe it or not, I actually tricked a girl into falling in love with me. I'm not quite sure how I did it. I'd hate to have to do it again. But I did it. Wanna say hi to my better half?
What?
Tell him we'll be hittin' his area some time tomorrow.
Alabama, could you tell Clar -
Ask him if he got the letter.
Clarence sent a letter?
Has he gotten his mail today?
Money problems?
Now tell him goodbye.
That's a pretty amazing story.

Good for you.
Good for you.
What's so fuckin' good about it? Actresses are the most fucked-in-the-head bunch of women in the world. It's like they gotta pass a test of emotional instability before they can get their SAG card. Oh, guess what? I had a really good reading for "T.J. Hooker" the other day.
... formica. I did real well. I think she liked me.
Did you meet Captain Kirk?
Did you meet Captain Kirk?
You don't meet him in the audition. That comes later. Hope, hope.
How much of that letter was on the up and up?
Every word of it.
You're really in love, aren't you?
For the very first time in my life. Do you know what that's like?
This shit can't be real.
It'll get ya high.
It's fuckin' real! It's fuckin' real!

This is Drexl's coke?
Drexl's dead. This is Clarence's coke and Clarence can do whatever he wants with it. And what Clarence wants to do is sell it. Then me and Bama are gonna leave on a jet plane and spend the rest of our lives spendin'. So, you got my letter, have you lined up any buyers?

Look, Clarence, I'm not Joe Cocaine.
But you're an actor. I hear these Hollywood guys have it delivered to the set.
Yeah, they do. And maybe when I start being a successful actor I'll know those guys. But most of the people I know are like me. They ain't got a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of. Now, if you want to sell a little bit at a time -

I'm offering a half a million dollars worth of white for two hundred thousand. How difficult can that be?
It's difficult because you're sellin' it to a particular group. Big shots. Fat cats. Guys who can use that kind of quantity. Guys who can afford two hundred thousand. Basically, guys I don't know. You don't know. And, more important, they don't know you. I did talk with one guy who could possibly help you.

He's nothing. He's in my acting class. But he works as an assistant to a very powerful movie producer named Lee Donowitz. I thought Donowitz could be interested in a deal like this. He could use it. He could afford it.

Don't expect me to be all broken up over poor Drexl. I think he was a fuckin', freeloadin', parasitic scumbag, and he got exactly what he deserved. I got no pity for a mad dog like that. I think I should get a merit badge or somethin'.
Clarence...
Let me handle this.
Yeah, well if we got lost, it's your ass. Come on, Clarence, lets go. Elliot's going to meet us in the lobby.
I'm just makin' sure we got everything. You got yours?
I got the part on "T.J. Hooker".
No shit? Dick, that's great!
They didn't even want a callback. They just hired me like that. Me and Peter Breck are the two heavies. We start shooting Monday. My call is for seven o'clock in the morning.
Ah, Dick, let's talk about it in the car. We can't be late.
Clarence.
Yeah?
Yeah?
Um, nothing, let's go?
What the fuck did you bring that for.
In case.

Look, Dillinger, Lee Donowitz is not a pimp -
I know that Richard. I don't think I'll need it. But something this last week has taught me, it's better to have a gun and not to need it than to need a gun and not to have it.
Do you really mean it?
No, I don't really mean it. Well, I mean, this is our last chance to think about it. How 'bout you, Bama?
Now's a helluva time to play "what if".
This is our last chance to play "what if". I want to do it. I'm just scared of getting caught.
Well, if we're not gonna do it, let's just get in the car and get the fuck outta here.
Yeah, let's just get outta here.
No. But thanks.
No thanks, my stomach's a little upset. I ate somethin' at a restaurant that made me a little sick.
I'd fuck Elvis.
Really?
Really?
When he was alive. I wouldn't fuck him now.
When he was alive. I wouldn't fuck him now.
I don't blame you. So we'd both fuck Elvis. It's nice to meet people with common interests, isn't it?
Well, enough about the King, how 'bout you?
How 'bout me what?
How 'bout me what?
How 'bout you go to the movies with me tonight?

Want an animal cracker?

Yeah, OK.
Leave the gorillas.

Unloading? That's a helluva way to describe the bargain of a lifetime.
I grow it on my window-sill. The lights really great there and I'm up high enough so you can't see it from the street.
Ha ha ha. No really, where does it come from?

Look, Dick, I don't -
No problem, Elliot. I'm just fuckin' wit ya, that's all. Actually, I'll tell you but you gotta keep it quiet. Understand, if Dick didn't assure me you're good people I'd just tell ya, none of your fuckin' business. But, as a sign of good faith, here it goes: I gotta friend in the department.

The police department?
The police department?
Duh. What else would I be talking about? Now stop askin' stupid doorknob questions. Well, a year and a half ago, this friend of mine got access to the evidence room for an hour. He snagged this coke. But, he's a good cop with a wife and a kid, so he sat on it for a year and a half until he found a

We were in Four H together. We've known each other since childhood. So, I'm handling the sales part. He's my silent partner and he knows if I get fucked up, I won't drop dime on him. I didn't tell you nothin' and you didn't hear nothin'.

No. No, you don't.
No. No, you don't.
Then why are you telling me all this bullshit just so you can fuck me?
Get it straight, Lee isn't into taking risks. He deals with a couple of guys, and he's been dealing with them for years. They're reliable. They're dependable. And, they're safe.
Riddle me this, Batman. If you're all so much in love with each other, what the fuck are you doing here? I'm sure you got better things to do with your time than walk around in circles starin' up a panther's ass. Your guy's interested because with that much shit at his fingertips he can play Joe fuckin' Hollywood till the wheels come off.
He wants to talk ya.
Mr. Donowitz? I told you, through Dick. He's in my acting class. About a year. Yeah, he's good. They grew up together. Sure thing.
He says Wednesday at three o'clock at the Beverly Wilshire. He wants everybody there. He'll talk to you. If after talkin' to you he's convinced you're OK, he'll do business. If not, he'll say fuck it and walk out the door. He also wants a sample bag.
No problems on both counts.
Where's everybody else?
They'll be along.
Well, I guess it's about that time.
I guess so. Follow me.
Elliot.
Yeah?
Yeah?
Get on your knees.
Don't you?
No.
No.
Don't lie to me, motherfucker. You apparently think I'm the dumbest motherfucker in the world! Don't you? Say: Clarence, you are without a doubt, the dumbest motherfucker in the whole wide world. Say it!
Say it, goddamn it!
You are the dumbest person in the world.
You are the dumbest person in the world.
Apparently I'm not as dumb as you thought I am.

No. No you're not.

You know, I saw it on the stands, my first inclination was to buy it. But, I look at the price and say forget it, it's just gonna be the same old shit. I ended up breaking down and buying it a few days later. Man, I was ever wrong.

It tried to pin down what the attraction is after all these years. It covers the whole spectrum of fans, the people who love his music, the people who grew up with him, the artists he inspired - Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, and the fanatics, like these guys. I don't know about you, but they give me the creeps.
I can see what you mean.
I can see what you mean.
Like, look at her. She looks like she fell off an ugly tree and hit every branch on the way down. Elvis wouldn't fuck her with Pat Boone's dick.
I don't know, Clarence, "Doctor Zhivago" is a pretty big movie.
The biggest. The biggest movie you've ever dealt with, Lee. We're talkin' a lot of film. A man'd have ta be an idiot not to be a little cautious about a movie like that. And Lee, you're no idiot.
But the bottom line is: I'm not Paramount. I have a select group of distributers I deal with. I buy their little movies. Accomplish what I wanna accomplish, end of story. Easy, business-like, very little risk.
Now that's bullshit, Lee. Every time you buy one of those little movies it's a risk. I'm not sellin' you something that's gonna play two weeks, six weeks, then go straight to cable. This is "Doctor Zhivago". This'll be packin' 'em in for a year and a half. Two years! That's two years you don't have to work with anybody's movie but mine.
Well, then, what's the hurry? Is it true the rights to "Doctor Zhivago" are in arbitration?
I wanna be able to announce this deal at Cannes. If I had time for a courtship, Lee, I would. I'd take ya out, I'd hold your hand, I'd kiss you on the cheek at the door. But, I'm not in that position. I need to know if we're in bed together, or not. If you want my movie, Lee, you're just gonna have
Well, I have to admit, walkin' through the door and seein' these "Soldier of Fortune" poster boys made me a bit nervous. But, Lee, I'm fairly confident that you came here to do business, not to be a wise-guy. So, if you want, I'll put the gun on the table.
I don't think that'll be necessary. Let's all have a seat. Boris, why don't you be nice and get coffee for everybody.
Oh, Mr. Donowitz -
Lee, Clarence . Please don't insult me. Call me Lee.
Lee, Clarence . Please don't insult me. Call me Lee.
OK, sorry, Lee. I just wanna tell you "Coming Home in a Body Bag" is one of my favorite movies. After "Apocalypse Now" I think it's the best Vietnam movie ever.
OK, sorry, Lee. I just wanna tell you "Coming Home in a Body Bag" is one of my favorite movies. After "Apocalypse Now" I think it's the best Vietnam movie ever.
Thank you very much, Clarence.
Thank you very much, Clarence.
You know, most movies that win a lot of Oscars, I can't stand. "Sophie's Choice", "Ordinary People", "Kramer vs. Kramer", "Gandhi". All that stuff is safe, geriatric, coffee-table dog shit.

I hear you talkin' Clarence. We park our cars in the same garage.
Like that Merchant-Ivory clap-trap. All those assholes make are unwatchable movies from unreadable books.
Now, that's practically uncut. You could, if you so desire, cut it a helluva lot more.
Don't worry, I'll desire. Boris, could I have some more coffee.
Don't worry, I'll desire. Boris, could I have some more coffee.
Me too, Boris.
You like a little coffee with your cream and sugar?
I'm not satisfied till the spoon stands straight up.

Elliot tells me you're fronting for a dirty cop.
Well, Elliot wasn't supposed to tell you anythin'. Thanks a lot, bigmouth. I knew you were a squid the moment I laid eyes on you. In my book, buddy, you're a piece of shit. He's not a dirty cop, he's a good cop. He just saw his chance and he took it.

Get a six-pack of something imported. It's hard to tell you what to get 'cause different places have different things. If they got Fosters, get that, if not, ask the guy at the thing what the strongest imported beer he has. Look, since you're making a beer run, would you mind too terribly if you did a foot run as well. I'm fuckin' starvin'
I'm really not very -
You know what would taste good? Chicken. I haven't had chicken in a while. Chicken would really hit the spot about now. Chicken and beer, definitly, absolutely, without a doubt. Where's a good chicken place around here?

Daddy, I'm in big fuckin' trouble and I really need your help.
Look, I don't know this is pretty heavy-duty, so if you wanna explode, feel free.
You're always making jokes. That's what you do, isn't it? Make jokes. Making jokes is the one thing you're good at, isn't it? But if you make a joke about this - - I'm gonna go completely out of my fuckin' head!
What do you want from me?

I have a son of my own. About you boy's age. I can imagine how painful this must be for you. But Clarence and that bitch-whore girlfriend of his brought this all on themselves. And I implore you not to go down the road with 'em. You can always take comfort in the fact that you never had a choice.

I'm talkin' about a massacre. They snatched my narcotics and hightailed it outta there. Wouldda gotten away with it, but your son, fuckhead that he is, left his driver's license in a dead guy's hand. A whore hiding in the commode filled in all the blanks.

Sure.
Oh, don't bother. I got one. So you're a Sicilian, huh?
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
You know I read a lot. Especially things that have to do with history. I find that shit fascinating. In fact, I don't know if you know this or not, Sicilians were spawned by niggers.
Come again?
It's a fact. Sicilians have nigger blood pumpin' through their hearts. If you don't believe me, look it up. You see, hundreds and hundreds of years ago the Moors conquered Sicily. And Moors are niggers. Way back then, Sicilians were like the wops in northern Italy. Blond hair, blue eyes. But, once the Moors moved in there, they changed the whole country. They did

Okee-dokee. It's like this, Krinkle; a patrol car stops this dork for speeding, they walk up to window and the guy's covered in coke. So they bring his ass in and me an' Nicholson go to work on him.

To front for him. So Elliot is workin' out the deal between them and his boss, a big movie producer named Lee Donowitz.
He produced "Coming Home in a Body Bag".
He's so spooked he'd turn over his momma, his daddy, his two-panny granny, and Anna and the King of Siam if he had anything on him.
This rabbit'll do anything not to do time, including wearing a wire.
Like gang-busters. Now, remember, if you don't want to go to jail, we gotta put your boss in jail.
We have to show in court that, without a doubt, a successful man, an important figure in the Hollywood community, is also dealing cocaine.

Yeah, that's right, laugh. It's so funny, oh it's so funny. There used to be a time when sisters didn't know shit about gettin' their pussy licked. Then the sixties came an' they started fuckin' around with white boys. And white boys are freaks for that shit -

Then, after a while sisters use to gettin' their little pussy eat. And because you white boys had to make pigs out of yourselves, you fucked it up for every nigger in the world everywhere.

Excuse me, Mr. Coccotti. Do you know Nick Cardella?
No.
No.
Then where the hell do you get off talkin' that kind of talk?
Then where the hell do you get off talkin' that kind of talk?
I didn't mean -
I didn't mean -
Shut your mouth. Nick Cardella was provin' what his words was worth before you were in your daddy's nutsack. What sun do you walk under you can throw a shadow on Nick Cardella? Nick Cardella's a stand-up guy.
What was the Jew-boy's name?
Donowitz, he said.
We want you to tell us about last night.
I went to the surface and I collected specimens like I was told.
Wake up, Cole.
Uh, I didn't hear the...
No, sir!
We have a very advanced program, something very different, requires very skilled people.
Well?
Uh, what?
Him? You saw that man?
Uh, I think so. In the mental hospital.
Women will want to get to know you...
I DON'T WANT YOUR "WOMEN," YOU BRAINLESS TWIT! I WANT TO BE WELL!
The food, the sky, the certain, uh, sexual temptations -- you haven't become "addicted" have you, Cole? To that "dying" world'
No, sir! I just want to do my part. To get us back on top...in charge of the planet. And I have the experience, I know who the people are...
You said we weren't "real," Cole...
Well, sir, I don't think the human mind was built to exist in two different... whatever you call it..."dimensions." It's stressful, you said it yourselves, it gets you confused. You don't know what's real and what's not.
I understand. There'd be no point.
We're going to think about it, Cole. Among ourselves. We'll get back to you.
To be determined by the proper authorities.
You don't want to jeopardize that reduction, do you, Cole? Have it taken away?
We want tough minded people. Strong mentally. We've had some...misfortunes with "unstable" types.
For a man in your position...an opportunity.
He's drugged out of his mind! He's completely zoned out.
Cole, did you or did you not record that message?
But just until you recover your, uh,... equilibrium.
You're still a little... disoriented.
We're very close! Because of you!
This is it, James...what you've been working for.
I told you that fuckhead Mason would get us into something like this.
Shut up!
That's him.
What are you going to do with us?
It's the kidnap woman -- the one who was with the guy who tied us up.
What's she doing?
What's she doing?
She's drawing attention to us, that's what she's doing. ... I don't know what you're up to this time, Mason, but you're gonna get us in deep shit!
Wow, a guy in a Chevy is chasing her and some other guy I can't see.
Hey, no problem, it's probably just another kidnapping featuring Jeffrey's shrink, pardon me, make that ex-shrink. This is your leader, a certifiable lunatic who told his former psychiatrist all his plans for God knows what whacko irresponsible schemes, and now who knows what she's painted out there on our wall?
It's important to observe everything.
I think it was...I'm sure it was 2nd Street.
They forced me to take drugs.
Forced you! Why would someone force you to take drugs?
Forced you! Why would someone force you to take drugs?
I got into trouble. I got arrested. But I still got you a specimen -- a spider -- but I didn't have anyplace to put it, so I ate it. It was the wrong year anyway, so I guess it doesn't matter.
Let's consider again our current information -- if the symptoms were first detected in Philadelphia on June 28, 1995, that makes us know that...?
It was released in Philadelphia, probably on June 14, 1995.
It was released in Philadelphia, probably on June 14, 1995.
And it appeared sequentially after that in...?
San Francisco, New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking.
Meaning...???

That the virus was taken from Philadelphia to San Francisco, then to New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking.

Uh, so that a vaccine can be developed that will, uh, allow mankind to reclaim the surface of the earth.
Mr. Cole? My name is Doctor Railly. I'm a psychiatrist. I work for the County -- I don't work for the police. My only concern is your well being -- do you understand that?
I need to go now.
I need to go now.
I'm going to be completely honest. I'm not going to lie to you. I can't make the police let you go...but I do want to help you. And I want you to trust me. Can you do that, James? May I call you "James"?

It was some lady. She didn't know anything.
Perhaps it was a wrong number...
Perhaps it was a wrong number...
No. That's the reason they chose me -- I remember things.
James, where did you grow up? Was it around here? Around Baltimore?
What?
What?
I have the...strangest feeling I've met you before...a long time ago, perhaps. Were you ever...?
I have the...strangest feeling I've met you before...a long time ago, perhaps. Were you ever...?
Wait! This is only 1989! I'm supposed to be leaving messages in 1995. It's not the right number yet. That's the problem. Damn! How can I contact them?
It's just a shot to calm you.
No more drugs. Please...
No more drugs. Please...
I have to do this, James. You're very confused.
Cole! James Cole! You escaped from a locked room six years ago.
1989. Six years for you. There's the sign! Right here!
I can't believe this is a coincidence, Mr. Cole. Have you been...following me?
You told me you'd help me. I know this isn't what you meant, but...I was desperate... no money...bum leg... sleeping on the streets. I probably smell bad. Sorry about that. But then I saw your book in a store window with a notice about your lecture. I can read, remember?

Yes, I remember. Why do you want to go to Philadelphia?
Yes, I remember. Why do you want to go to Philadelphia?
It's the next step. I checked out the Baltimore information, it was nothing. It's Philadelphia, that's where they are, the ones who killed everyone. Zs that a radio? Does it play music?
You used to call me "James".
You'd prefer that? ... James...you don't really have a gun, do you.
You'd prefer that? ... James...you don't really have a gun, do you.
Everybody's got a gun. In this city...
"Never cry wolf!"
What?
What?
My father told me that. "Never cry wolf." Then people won't believe you if...something really happens.
My father told me that. "Never cry wolf." Then people won't believe you if...something really happens.
"If something really happens"...like what, James?
"If something really happens"...like what, James?
Something bad. Is that all the music? I don't want to hear this stuff...
Did something terrible happen to you when you were a child? Something so bad...?
Ohhhh, that one! Can we hear that one?
You were in my dream just now. Your hair was different, but I'm sure it was you.
We dream about what's important in our lives. And I seem to have become pretty important in yours. What was the dream about?

You were very upset. You're always very upset in the dream, but I never knew it was you before.
It wasn't me before, James. It's become me now because of...what's happening. Please untie me.
No, I think it was always you. It's very strange.
You're flushed. And you were moaning. I think you're running a fever. What are you doing?
My notes. Observations. Clues.
Clues? What kind of clues?
Clues? What kind of clues?
A secret army. The Army of The Twelve Monkeys. I've told you about them. They spread the virus. That's why we have to get to Philadelphia. I have to find them -- it's my assignment.

What will you do...when you find this...secret army?
What will you do...when you find this...secret army?
I just have to locate the virus in its original form before it mutates. So scientists can come back and study it and find a cure. So that those of us who survived can go back to the surface of the earth.
Does that disturb you, James? Thinking about that little boy in the well?
When I was a kid I identified with that kid, down there alone in that pipe...a hundred feet down -- doesn't know if they're going to save him.

Nevermind. It's not real -- it's a hoax. A prank. He's hiding in a barn. Hey, turn left here. Left!
Look, I'm warning you. You do anything, I'm going to go crazy -- hurt people!
I'm not going to "do" anything, I promise. But you need help, James. None of this is what you think it is.
They're keeping an eye on me.
Who's keeping an eye on you?
Who's keeping an eye on you?
The man...with the voice. I recognized him. He's from the present. He...
Are you hurt?
Uh, no. Yes. I mean, just some scrapes...
Oh, Jesus, James! You killed him!
I did him a favor. Now come on.
You didn't have a gun before, did you?
I've got one now.
I told you what I want. Lock the door!
James, why don't we...?
James, why don't we...?
Lock it now!
Mason???
Jeffrey Mason?
All I see are dead people. Everywhere. What's three more?
You know Dr. Mason's son, Jeffrey Mason, don't you, James? You met him in the County Hospital six years ago.
The guy was a total fruitcake.
And he told you then his father was a famous virologist.
We need gas.
I thought you didn't know how to drive.

Shot! Who shot you?
Shot! Who shot you?
It was some kind of...war. Never mind, you wouldn't believe me. Turn off here.
You were going to run out off gas on purpose, weren't you?
No. I want you to turn yourself in, James -- It'll go much better for you if you do -- but I'm not going to trick you.
No. I want you to turn yourself in, James -- It'll go much better for you if you do -- but I'm not going to trick you.
That has your name on it. Give him cash.
You smell so good.
You have to give yourself up, you know.
What have you done? Did you...kill someone?
No! I...don't think so. I stole a car and they chased me. I hit a tree.
No! I...don't think so. I stole a car and they chased me. I hit a tree.
See -- you can drive after all!
See -- you can drive after all!
Yeah, sort of, I guess. I...I'm sorry I locked you up. I thought...I thought... I think maybe I am crazy!
What made you think that?
Jeffrey Mason said it was my idea about the virus. And suddenly, I wasn't sure. We talked when I was in the institution, and it was all...fuzzy. The drugs and stuff. You think maybe I'm the one who wiped out the human race? It was my idea?

Nobody is going to wipe out the human race. Not you or Jeffrey or anybody else. You've created something in your mind, James -- a substitute reality. In order to avoid something you don't want to face.

I'm..."mentally divergent". I would love to believe that.
I'm..."mentally divergent". I would love to believe that.
It can be dealt with, but only if you want to. I can help you.
I need help all right. They're coming after me.
First, it's important that you surrender to them instead of them catching you running. Okay?
First, it's important that you surrender to them instead of them catching you running. Okay?

Give me the gun.
Give me the gun.
The gun! ... I lost it
The gun! ... I lost it
You're sure?
You're sure?
No gun! Stars! Air! I can live here. Breathe!
James! That's a policeman. Pretend you don't know me. If he sees you...
No, I want to turn myself in. Where is he? Don't worry -- it's all okay now. I'm not crazy any more! I mean, I am crazy, mentally divergent, actually, but I know it now and I want you to help me. I want to get well...
I don't understand what we're doing.
We're avoiding the police until I can....talk to you.
We're avoiding the police until I can....talk to you.
You mean, treat me? Cure me? Kathryn, those words on the wall -- I've seen them before... I...I...dreamed them.

I thought I was in...prison again.

I want to be here. In this time. With you. I want to become...become a whole person. I want this to be the present. I want the future to be unknown.
James...do you remember...six years ago...you had a phone number! You tried to call and...
You want me to rob him?
I...I...We need cash, James.
It's a Carpet Cleaning Company...
A Carpet Cleaning Company?
A Carpet Cleaning Company?
No superiors! No scientists. No people from the future. It's just a Carpet Cleaning Company. They have voice mail -- you leave a message telling them when you want your carpet cleaned.

You... you left them a message?
You... you left them a message?
I couldn't resist. I was so relieved. Wait'll they hear this nutty woman telling them...they better watch out for the Army of the Twelve Monkeys...
You... you couldn't have heard me.
They got your message, Kathryn. They played it for me. It was a bad recording...distorted. I didn't recognize your voice.
I think I've seen this movie before. When I was a kid. It was on TV.
Shh -- don't talk. Hold still.
Shh -- don't talk. Hold still.
I have seen it, but I don't remember this part. Funny, it's like what's happening to us, like the past. The movie never changes -- it can't change -- but everytime you see it, it seems to be different because you're different -- you notice different things.

If we can't change anything...because it's already happened, then we ought to at least smell the flowers.
If we can't change anything...because it's already happened, then we ought to at least smell the flowers.
Flowers! What flowers?
Why are we doing this?
So we can stick our heads out the window and feel the wind and listen to the music. So we can appreciate what we have while we have it. Forgive me, psychiatrists don't cry.
But maybe I'm wrong. Maybe you're wrong. Maybe we're both crazy.
In a few weeks, it will have started or it won't. If there are still baseball games and traffic jams, armed robberies and boring TV shows -- we'll be so happy, we'll be glad to turn ourselves in to the police.
You were in my dream just now. I didn't recognize you.
Well, you look pretty different, too.
Well, you look pretty different, too.
I mean in my dream -- I didn't realize it was you. Then...I woke up and I...I thought you were gone.

I remember you...like this. I feel I've known you before. I feel I've always known you.
That's what they were up to! Freeing animals!
On the walls -- they meant the animals when they said, "We did it."
I know this place! ... This is my dream.
Airports all look the same. Maybe it's... James! Your moustache! It's slipping.
They may be looking for us, James. Use this. You can fix it in the Men's Room.
I was here...as a kid. I think you were here, too. But you...looked just like you look now.

James, if we're identified, they're going to send us someplace...but not to Key West!

Right! You're right. I have to fix this.
Right! You're right. I have to fix this.
I'll get the tickets and meet you... in the Gift Shop.
Does this bother you, Mr. Cole?
No! Look, I don't belong here! What I need to do is make a telephone call to straighten everything out.

So you could talk to these scientists and they do what? Send you to the future?
So you could talk to these scientists and they do what? Send you to the future?
No, no. I can't talk to them. It's called, "voice mail". I'm supposed to leave messages. They monitor it from the present.
What'd they give you? Thorazine? How much? Learn your drugs -- know your doses.
I need to make a telephone call.
I need to make a telephone call.
A telephone call? That's communication with the outside world! Doctor's discretion. Hey, if alla these nuts could just make phone calls, it could spread. Insanity oozing through telephone cables, oozing into the ears of all those poor sane people, infecting them! Whackos everywhere! A plague of madness. In fact, very few of us here are actually mentally ill. I'm not saying you're not mentally
Germs?!
In the 18th century there was no such thing! Nobody'd ever imagined such a thing -- no sane person anyway. Along comes this doctor...Semmelweiss, I think. He tries to convince people... other doctors mostly...that there are these teeny tiny invisible "bad things" called germs that get into your body and make you...sick! He's trying to get doctors to wash their hands. What is this
"What about the germs?" I say. He goes, "I don't believe in germs. Germs are just a plot they made up so they can sell you disinfectants and soap!" Now, he's crazy, right? Hey, you believe in germs, don't you?
I'm not crazy.
I'm not crazy.
Of course not, I never thought you were. You want to escape, right? That's very sane. I can help you. You want me to, don't you? Get you out?
Of course not, I never thought you were. You want to escape, right? That's very sane. I can help you. You want me to, don't you? Get you out?
If you know how to escape, why don't you...?
If you know how to escape, why don't you...?
Why don't I escape, that's what you were going to ask me, right? 'Cause I'd be crazy to escape! I'm all taken care of, see? I've sent out word.
Why don't I escape, that's what you were going to ask me, right? 'Cause I'd be crazy to escape! I'm all taken care of, see? I've sent out word.
What's that mean?
What's that mean?
I've managed to contact certain underlings, evil spirits, secretaries of secretaries, and assorted minions, who will contact my father. When he learns I'm in this kind of place, he'll have them transfer me to one of those classy joints where they treat you...properly. LIKE A GUEST! LIKE A PERSON! SHEETS! TOWELS! LIKE A BIG HOTEL WITH GREAT DRUGS FOR THE NUT CASE LUNATIC MANIAC
They hurt you!
Not as bad as what they're doing to kitty.
Look at those assholes, they're asking for it! Maybe people deserved to be wiped out!
Wiping cut the human race! That's a great idea! But it's more of a long term thing -- right now we have to focus on more immediate goals. I didn't say a word about "you know what".

You do know me. You helped me once.

That would be totally out of character. Helping people is against my principles. See, he definitely doesn't know me. Now, I'm going to go back and listen to my father's very eloquent discourse on the perils of science WHILE YOU TORTURE THIS INTRUDER TO DEATH.

I just need to have access to the pure virus, that's all! For the future!
I don't have time to go upstairs. The police are looking for me. I need to know where it is and exactly what it is.
I get it! This is your old plan, right?

Plan? What are you talking about?
Remember? We were in the dayroom, watching TV, and you were all upset about the...desecration of the planet. And you said to me, "Wouldn't it be great if there was a germ or a virus that could wipe out mankind and leave the plants and animals just as they are?" You do remember that, don't you?

We'll get to the spider later, Mr. Cole. Right now, we want to know everything that you saw.
I asked you, why did you volunteer?
Well, the guard woke me up. He told me I volunteered.
Uh, that message...me?
It's a digital reconstruction of a message, Cole, from a weak signal on our contact number. Did you make that call?

Yes, sir.

He was fully sedated!
Then are you trying to tell me that a fully sedated, fully restrained patient somehow slipped out that vent, replaced the grill behind him and that he's wriggling through the ventilation system right now?
He kidnapped you, Kathryn. You saw him murder someone. You knew there was a real possibility he would kill you, too. You were under tremendous emotional stress.
For God sakes, Owen, listen to me -- he knew about the boy in Fresno and he says three billion people are going to die!
For God sakes, Owen, listen to me -- he knew about the boy in Fresno and he says three billion people are going to die!
Kathryn, you know he can't possibly know that. You're a rational person. You're a trained psychiatrist. You know the difference between what's real and what's not.

And what we believe is what's accepted as "truth" now, isn't it, Owen? Psychiatry -- it's the latest religion. And we're the priests -- we decide what's right and what's wrong --we decide who's crazy and who isn't. ... I'm in trouble, Owen. I'm losing my faith.

You "develop" viruses and you're calling me insane? Typical. What does this virus attack? Don't tell me, you sick fuck, it doesn't matter. Have I ever "developed" a virus? Do I put helpless animals in cages and measure their reactions to electrical stimuli? Do I inject radioactive substances into living creatures and examine their bowel movements? Wow! And I'm crazy!

WHO CARES WHAT PSYCHIATRISTS WRITE ON WALLS? You think I told her about the Army of the 12 Monkeys? Impossible! Know why, you pathetically ineffectual and pusillanimous "pretend-friend-to- animals"?! I'll tell you why: because when I had anything to do with her six years ago, there was no such thing -- I hadn't even thought of it yet!
Then how come she knows what's going on?
-- so they get there and they ask the guy real nice for some kind of i.d., and he gets agitated, starts screaming about viruses. Totally irrational, totally disoriented, doesn't know where he is, what day it is, alla that stuff. All they got was his name. They figure he's stoned out of his mind, it's some kinda psychotic episode, so they're gonna bring
He's been tested for drugs?
He's been tested for drugs?
Negative for drugs. But he took on five cops like he was dusted to the eyeballs. No drugs. You believe that?
You have him in restraints.
Were you listening? We got two officers in the hospital. Yeah, he's in restraints, plus the medic gave him enough stellazine to kill a horse. Look at him! Still on his feet.
That would explain the bruises, I guess. The struggle.
You want to go in? Examine him?

Yes, please. You said he gave a name...

Well, now, you just know all there is about bein' a mechanic, don't you? I can't do unauthorized work. I suppose I can just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket. Then you get in an accident and get killed. Or worse. Who they gonna blame then? They gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation.

What was that all about?
You know how that Toby is. Thinks every man he sees is after his Jenny.

More like Jenny is after every man she sees.
You pay Toby no mind. He just likes to show off for his girl. Give him a couple of hours, he'll cool off. Still want that beer?
Poor thing. Is she all right?
'Cept that she lost her money and the sons of bitches stole her wedding ring. That's when she started shooting. Can't blame her. The ring was all Carlos left her when he died.
Lord! Put the baby in the icebox. Killed the poor thing.
Baby didn't die. Just froze off all it's finger and toes. Just a little fingerless, toeless boy now. But the husband; he sees what the wife's done, so after he saves the baby he locks the wife in the refrigerator to see how she likes it. Now she died.
Let me get your change.
Flo, I'm just gonna help myself to a refill on the coffee.
Ned! Now look at what you done! Are you all right?
I think I burned my gun hand!

It'd serve you right. Jose, run get a mop and clean this mess up.
That yours, Mrs. McKenna?
Yes. Yes it is.
Yes. Yes it is.
Taking a little trip?
Taking a little trip?
I had a fight with Jake. I . . . I just wanted to get away for awhile. Mr. Stewart was kind enough to take me as far as Montrose. I'm going to take a bus to my sister's. I thought I'd stay with her for a few days.

Is that right? Can't say as I blame you for wanting to head out for a bit. I know I've had my fill of this town. Sixteen years I've been the law and order here. So long I forgot why I ever wanted the job in the first place. Help people, I guess. Keep the peace. Problem is there's so much peace around here

I . . .
I could do that. 'Course we'd have to go back into town. There'd be a whole crowd of people around when the trunk was opened. A whole crowd of witnesses. That wouldn't be too pretty, now would it?
John . . .
Is that the way you want it, boy? A bullet in the head in the middle of the desert? Ends like this and you won't be able to spend a dime of that blood money.
He killed him, Sheriff! I couldn't stop him! He made me come with him. He told me if I said a word he would kill me too.
For the love of God would you two give it a rest? Lord almighty. In all my years I have never seen anything so pathetic. How far did you think you were going to get with this? Neither one of you can wait to slit the others throat. Now use what little smarts you got. If I was going to bust you I wouldn't
What do you want?
What do you want?
Same thing you want. I want to be out of Sierra; to be able to do as I please. But that takes money.
. . .at the very least. I know there was more than thirty-thousand dollars. Now, how much did you get?
Don't tell him anything. He can't do this.
Don't tell him anything. He can't do this.
Can't I? You're out in the desert, all alone, with a body in your trunk. What do you think, boy?
There you go, Mrs. McKenna. Just put it in there.
John--
That wasn't so bad. What's thirty- some-thousand to rich folks like you? It didn't hurt a bit.
Sheriff Potter.
Jake. I thought you would be at work, dear.
Who the hell is this!?
Who was that on the phone?
Wrong number.
Wrong number.
You spent a long time talking for a wrong number. But then you make friends so easily. Don't you, Grace?
I put up new drapes, Jake.
I know. I was here when your apprentice was helping you. Remember?

How could I? I was sleeping.

The wind isn't blowing.
Jake, what is that?
What does it look like?
What does it look like?
When did you buy a gun?
Oh my God, Jake, no. If it is someone they'll go away. Or call the police. Don't go out there.
What are you afraid of? I'm the one's got the gun. Stay here.
What are you afraid of? I'm the one's got the gun. Stay here.
Jake. No. No!
Can I give you a hand, beautiful?
I'm just going to my car.
I'm just going to my car.
That's right on my way.
My mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.
My name is John. Now I'm not a stranger anymore. See how easy it is for us to get to know each other, beautiful?

You should be more careful.
It's very nice of you to help me. That package is kind of heavy, and it's so hot.
No trouble at all, really.
Wasn't nothing.
Oh, this isn't my car. It's down a ways. I should have parked closer. I just didn't think it would be so heavy. I could drive up.

I couldn't stay in this place. I wouldn't. I'd just pick up, do whatever I had to do, and get out.

Really? And what game did you want to play? You carry my box for me, and I fall into bed with you?
I think I can find my own way back to into town.
Maybe I like to find out about a man first. Maybe I like to know what he's made of.
Maybe I like to find out about a man first. Maybe I like to know what he's made of.
I'm just flesh and blood, baby. That and a few memories of bad women; just like most guys. But you already know that. You read my fortune. Thanks for the lemonade.
You never did answer my question.
Still playing?

That's not an answer. What is it you want?

You know what I want.
You know what I want.
Maybe I just want to hear you say it.
Damn it, Grace! Tell him.
If he says that's what happened, Jake, it must be true.
Doesn't the heat bother you?
Yeah, but I like the sun. I grew up on a reservation. The sun, the desert; they were like a religion to us. Jake's the same way. He loves the desert. I guess we're alike that way. That's about the only way.

You love him?
No.
No.
Did you ever?
Did you ever?
Depends on what you call love. When I was growing up I had nothing. I learned to want everything. I wanted more than Sierra anyway. Jake was my ticket. He's not much; he's older than me, different than me, but he's got more money than half this town put together. I courted him. I let him think he was courtin' me, but I reeled

I'm still here, aren't I? See this?
All this nothing? I've spent my life in this stinking desert. It doesn't get to Jake like it got to me. He doesn't mind being out here. He doesn't mind being nothing but a land broker. Big fish in a small pond, he says. More like a little fish in a dried up watering hole.
You could just leave him.
You could just leave him.
I don't know how.
I don't know how.
You just walk away.
You just walk away.
It's not that easy. Maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please. I can't. I don't want to be alone. I need to know I'm going to be taken care of.

You need a meal ticket is what you mean. Some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here.

Is that so bad? It's not like I wouldn't try to make him happy. For awhile, anyway. I mean, I would . . . do things for him. I guess I'm no good that way. I guess I tried to sucker you along like that. Do you hate me for it? I wouldn't blame you if you did. But maybe it's like you said:

Please. I won't hang on you. As soon as we get there you can dump me. I don't care. I just want to get out of here.
Grace, I can't. I can't even get out of here myself. I need a hundred-fifty bucks to get my car back from that crazy mechanic.

From?

He's got money. In a floor safe in the living room. I've never seen it, but he talks about it all the time. More like brags. He loves his money. Wouldn't think of spending some of it on me.

Shit!
It's not like he's a young man. He's had time to live.
It's not like he's a young man. He's had time to live.
Jesus Christ! Listen to yourself! I can't do it, Grace. I can't do it.

I came back for you; this morning I came back. Before I even knew about the money. You're what I want.
The only reason I stormed off is because you sort of spooked me talking about Jake. But I've had nothing but time to think about it. It keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here. But we've got to get the money, baby. We get the money, I get the car, then we get the hell out.

You said you couldn't kill anybody.
You said you couldn't kill anybody.
We don't have to kill him. Just knock him out and tie him up 'till we get away.
Grace . . . Grace?
After dark. I'll leave the back door unlocked.
Why the hell didn't you do anything?
What was I supposed to do?
What was I supposed to do?
You could have hit him, or kneed him in the balls.
Where's the safe?
I don't know.
I don't know.
You don't know? Jesus Christ! Don't you think you should have found out before we killed him?
You don't know? Jesus Christ! Don't you think you should have found out before we killed him?
I'm not sure where it is. Not exactly. I never saw it. I just heard him talk about it.
I'm not sure where it is. Not exactly. I never saw it. I just heard him talk about it.
Oh, that's great. We killed Jake because you heard him talk about some money that you've never seen. That's fucking brilliant!

Don't yell at me!
Nothing. There's no safe under here.
There has to be!
There has to be!
There isn't! There's nothing under here but more floor. Jesus fucking Christ! We killed a man for nothing but floor.
It's got to be here. I heard him talk about it. He bragged about it. Six steps out, three left.
This is good. This is real good. This is so good they might not even charge us with murder when they catch us. They'll probably just lock us up for being idiots.

There's easily a hundred-thousand in there. More than that.
I told you. I knew it was there. Didn't I tell you?
If you want.
We're going all the way. Together.
Let's go in the bedroom.
No.
Let's do it here.
What about him?

Let him watch. I want him to know what he's missing.
You got a suitcase?
Never needed one. I've never been anywhere. I've got a backpack.

Wait. What about . . . him?
Wait. What about . . . him?
Put some clothes on him. When I get back We'll load him in the trunk and dump him in the desert. It'll takes days for anybody to find him.
John!? What the hell's the matter with you?
I . . . nothing. I just stubbed my toe on a rock. Hurt like hell . . . that's all.
I . . . nothing. I just stubbed my toe on a rock. Hurt like hell . . . that's all.
I got the money all packed. I put the jeep in the garage. Figure that way people will think maybe me and Jake went away. Might buy us some time.

John . . .?
Grace! Just . . . let me handle this. Sheriff, I'm telling you there's nothing in that trunk. If that's not good enough for you, then I'd be happy to open it. Just as soon as you get yourself a search warrant.
Sheriff Potter, please. I can't go to jail. I wanted no part of it.
You liar! You wanted him dead. You seduced me into killing him!
One-hundred-thousand dollars. A little more.
Damn you! What did you do that for? He can't prove anything.
Damn you! What did you do that for? He can't prove anything.
No, you just wanted me to keep my mouth shut so I could go to a hanging alone.
That's all talk. He's got nothing on us. He let you kill Jake.
Not me. Us.
Not me. Us.
It doesn't matter. He was there and he let it happen. He can't take us in.

He can't prove anything, John. He can't turn us in.
He can't prove anything, John. He can't turn us in.

I shot him.
You killed him!

Thirty-thousand, that's all. We would have been free and clear. You didn't have to kill him.
Thirty-thousand, that's all. We would have been free and clear. You didn't have to kill him.
It's our money. He had no right to take it.
You're crazy, you know that!? You're fucked up!?
Just drive.
Jesus, Grace. Did you have to kill him?
He was going to--
He was going to--
I know. He was to take the fucking money.
I know. He was to take the fucking money.
You're tense. What are you all uptight about?
You're tense. What are you all uptight about?
You killed a man for no reason!
Is that the kind of girl you think I am? What can I do to make you relax?
You could give me the gun.
Well, nothing.
Now what?

Now we dump Jake, split the money, then you're on your own.

The police don't know that. And it's going to be hard to explain it to them with a noose around your neck. I'll take you as far as California. If we can even make that. After that I'm cutting you loose.

Why? So when the cops catch up with us you can try and sell me out again? You take your hald of the money and run. You might want to try Mexico. With all that dough you'll live like a queen.

Can you climb back up.

Throw me the keys and I'll pull you up.
Throw me the keys and I'll pull you up.
Why don't you come down and get them so I can wring your pretty little neck?
John, if you don't throw me the keys, then I'll just walk away. Walk away and leave you here.
Walk to where? We're fifty miles to the nearest town. It's going to be over one-hundred degrees today. How far do you think you're going to get?

A lot that means.

Grace, tell him.
I have half a mind to--
Is this what it's all about? You sucker me up here so you can watch the two of us beat the shit out of each other over you? Forget it. You want to take my head off, Mister, I won't even try to stop you. I deserve it for being an idiot. But if you're not, I think I'll be on my way.
What happened to your hand?
Accident.

Got work. I know a man who's got a boat. Wants me to sail it for him.
You a sailor man? That'd be the life. Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away. A man could pretty well disappear like that. Just sail away until all he was was a memory. I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.

Wait a second--
Wait a second--
Ah, I can smell it on you.
Hey!
That's the sweat of a man who hasn't an honest bone in his body. Don't be offended, lad. A man who's got no ethics is a free man. I envy you that. Beside, I can hardly blame you. That Grace has a mind of her own, and a body to match, don't she? Eh?
She does at that. I knew when I married her she was a free spirit. A woman with her looks and a man my age; what was I to expect? But you see a woman like that in a town like this and you don't think, you do. So, I married her. What are you to do, eh? Women.
Can't live with them, and you can't shoot 'em.
I bet she led you on good, didn't she? Taking you up to the house with that smile of hers. Bet she wiggled her ass in your face more than once. Then me busting in like some wild bear. Bet you had a fire going under you.
Like you don't know.
Like you don't know.
Mad like a dog in heat, I bet you were. I can tell you got a temper on you.
Would you?
Would I what?
Would I what?
Would you kill her?
Why would I kill her?
Because I'm sick and tired of her little games. Because you could do it and drift away on your boat and no one would ever see you again. Because I've got a fifty-thousand dollar life insurance policy on her, and I would be more than happy to give the man who does her in a good chunk of it.
I'm not a murderer, Mr. McKenna.
How do you know if you've never tried?

You just seem to attract trouble, don't you?
Nice office you've got.
I do all right. Real estate isn't a bad game such as it is around here. The trick is to underestimate the price when you buy it, and overvalue when you sell. You can turn a few dollars that way.

Make it twenty.

Twenty-thousand? I don't have that kind of money. I won't get the insurance until months after she's dead. I don't imagine you'll want to be around after poor Grace's demise. Twenty-thousand; that's more money than I could ever get my hands on.

You drive a hard bargain, but I had a feeling you were my boy when I met you.
I'm not your boy, Jake. I don't like you, and I don't like what you are. I got no choice but to do business with you. This is just a nasty little marriage of convenience.

If you can't trust the man you've hired to kill your wife . . .?
I guess I might as well get this done with.
The sooner it's over, the sooner you're on your way. Now listen to me: It's got to look like an accident; that's the thing. If it doesn't, then it's no good. I won't get a dime, and it's my neck that'll be on the chopping block while you're living it up somewhere.

You're out in the desert, the middle of nowhere with no one around for miles, and you say the time wasn't right? What's the matter? You were hoping to get it on home video? A keepsake for the grandkids. Thank God I waited, or I never would have gotten it on tape.

I know all right. I know you're just enough of a shit to have a go at bedding a man's wife. You've probably bagged a few at that. You'd probably lie, cheat and steal without thinking twice. From that you'd just turn and walk away. But to kill; to get that blood on your hands. You can't wash that off. You'd be a marked

I hate loving her. I hate the kind of her person she is. I hate having to tolerate the little games she plays. I hate letting her use me. But I love her too much to do otherwise. And I certainly love her too much to kill her. I couldn't stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her

Give me two- hundred. I'll kill her and dump the body where no one will ever find it. But I need the money. I've got

A drifter, a loner, a trouble maker like you? Just passing through town, need money so he busts in on an, old man. Only this old man's got himself an automatic, and he knows how to use it. A man's got to protect his home. His wife. You're dead, boy, and your own mother wouldn't convict me.

You'd tell me anything to save your pathetic life.
You know what kind of woman Grace is. You know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of Sierra. What makes you think when you were planning on killing her she wasn't doing the same for you?

You shut your mouth, girl, and get back over to our table. Now, I'm not going to ask you again, Mister. What were you doing with my girl?
Honest, Toby. I just asked him for a quarter for the jukebox.
Stay out of this, Jenny. We got man's business to take care of.
I want to stay.
I said come on!
Toby! Toby Tyler, leave him alone!
You stay away, Jenny. I aim to mess him up, and that ain't a thing for a woman to see.
Hey, Mister. You gotta quarter?

I know, Mr. Vesci. I know. I was on my way to you, it's just . . . what a day I've had. You're not going to believe what's happened to me. I had the money, I swear I had it. I was on my way to you when my car breaks down in the middle of nowhere.
That's a shame, John. A real shame.
You don't know the how, Mr. Vesci. And that's not the half of it. I've got your money, and I go into this little grocery store to get something to eat and it gets robbed.

I had to beat it before the cops showed up. I don't have a cent to my name. I can't even get my car out of the garage. I tell you, Mr. Vesci, if it weren't for bad luck I wouldn't have any at all. So, I was wondering if you could wire me a hundred fifty-dollars so I could get my car. I'll
Let me get this straight: You owe me thirteen-thousand dollars, you call me - collect - then ask me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed.

His father worked in a strip mine north of here. Toby's school class went up to the mine one day. School takes field trips up there every year. Big day for the kids when they can see ore tore up out of the ground. Anyway, on this particular day Toby's dad up and falls into the machinery.

Yep. Tore him up good and spat out little, refined pieces of him. Nothing like the embarrassment of having your father refined in front of your classmates to put the anger in a young man.

Maybe not for you, Sheriff, but I think I've had my fill of your little town.
Nice night for a drive. Morning really. I guess that's about the only way to keep cool; riding around with the top down on a fancy convertible in the first hours of the day.
Not taking a drive, Sheriff. Heading out of town.

You bitch! You were in on it froom the start!
Shut up! The both of you. Ain't neither one of you too smart. Especially you, boy. Don't you think I had my eye on you since first you rolled into town? You smell like trouble. Stink of it like a ripe cesspool.

Killing Jake McKenna's got to amount to something. He wasn't much of a man, but that don't give you the right to murder him. And don't tell me you didn't, 'cause I know you did. I was there. Like I said; I been watching you.
That's what this is all about? A shakedown? You picked the wrong people. We don't have any money.
Sure you do. Everybody in town knows about the money Jake kept hid in the house. It's a wonder the Mrs. here just now got round to killing him. Not for lack of trying.
What'd you think, boy? That you were the first man to drift through this town she came on to? Not by a long shot. You're just the most gullible. How much did you get?
Thirty-thousand dollars.
Thirty-thousand dollars.
You ain't passing these test, son. If I can't trust you I'm gonna have to arrest you . . .
Nobody's going to hang. We're all gonna walk away with a little something. I ain't a greedy man. And, hell, you did all the work. One-hundred-thousand dollars. Split that three ways and it comes out to about thirty-three thousand. Give or take.
And you're taking?

I ain't got no eyes. You want to see?
Christ no!

Lost my eyes in Vyee-et-nam. Lost them fighting the commies. Fought the war and lost my eyes fightin' the commies just so you can come around here and make fun of me.

Don't forget to open it for me. I can't be opening my own bottle.

I think you'd better give your pooch a sip. He looks sick.
That's 'cause he's dead.
Oh, Jesus.
I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?

He's only just dead. What was I supposed to do with him? I can't take him away anywhere. And nobody wants to take him for me. Do you?

Hell no!
Hell no!
See. Ain't nothing I can do but keep him here beside me. That's where he belongs anyways. Me and Jesse, that's my dog, not anymore, but me and Jesse we been pals since the war when I lost my eyes. He was just a pup then... a companion that's loyal, that'll keep coming back to you no matter how much you kick him...I miss
You sure seen a lot for a blind man.
Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
That a fact?
Maybe I do.
Or maybe you just think you do. Just another small town. One guy chasing you. You go big town. Just gonna have four guys after you instead. Kiss kissy kiss.

Cocksucker motherfucker! Cops. I hear you. Always sneaking around. Thinks I can't see him. Well he's right. Motherfucker. But that ain't mean I don't know what's going on around here. They're all cursed. Yes sir.
Who's cursed?
Who's cursed?
All them miners last century. Hungry ghosts, killed off all the Indians. Up at the mine. Earth ran red with blood, think I'm fooling around here. White sky was on fire. Grown men cried like babies. I saw a flash, then darkness descended upon me. They put me in the joint. Took my eyes. I cursed them. White people can't seem to stay away
I thought you said you lost your eyes in the war?
So now you're going to tell me where I lost my eyes. You don't think I know where I lost my eyes? I was there when I lost them. I lost them in the war. The war in the joint. There's always wars in the joint. Cause I was a code talker in the joint and in the war too. Mmmm, nothing like the

Well, people gotta get by somehow. That's the curse. The mines done it. All that uranium, plutonium, fuffonium, fuckononium, assononium, all that "om"! Everybody's got a mother. You don't rip up your mother. You don't rip up the Earth and take everything out. It's like the Cracker Jack box says, "the more you eat, the more you want...."...

Your lies are old, but you tell 'em well.
Ain't over yet. Night is part of day; separate, but equal. Night is when you let your guard down; when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark.
Difference between you and me, old man, is I see the glass half full, you see it half empty.

Night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'. It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of.

Afraid of it? Boy, I live in the dark. All cause of a woman who made me this way. People are afraid of what they can't see. I can't see nuthin', so it's all the same to me. Kiss from a beautiful woman, kissy kissy kiss, a lick from a dog, slurp, slurp, the kiss of death . It's all the same to me.

You got a lotta philosophy in you, old timer but you don't fool me for one second with all this blind man crap. One minute you lost your eyes in Vietnam, next it's the joint. Now it's a woman? I'm hep to you.
Time's up. Any last words of wisdom?
Things ain't always the way they seem. You got to ask yourself: is it worth it? Day comes Earthmaker is going to look in your fucking heart! Then you better know what it is you're doing. <u>Are you a human being</u> -- or just one of them hungry ghosts out there floatin' around?
You <u>are</u> crazy, you know. Be seeing you, old man.
You know I won't be seeing you.
I wasn't doing anything.
That's not the way it looked to me. Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.
That's not the way it looked to me. Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.
Make time? Is everybody in this town on drugs?
Then maybe you should've. Look, pal, I wasn't making a play for your girl.
You expect me to believe that?

I don't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone.
I don't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone.
Mister, I'm calling you out.
Mister, I'm calling you out.

'Cause I'm just like dynamite. And when I go off, somebody gets hurt.

Stand up, Mister, or I'll beat you where you sit.
Mister!
Oh, shit!
That's right, Mister. You better be afraid. I told you it wasn't over, but you didn't listen. Now I find you sneakin' around with my girl behind my back.
I wasn't sneaking around with your girl. Would you please tell him?
Oh, that tears it, Mister. I'm gonna bust you up but good. I'm gonna bust you into a million pieces and then ... and then bust those pieces up, and then ... and then spread them all around. That's what I'm gonna do. You don't know what you're dealing with, Mister. I'm crazy. I'm psycho crazy.
Yeah, I know. You're TNT. Just like dynamite. When you go off somebody gets hurt. All right. Let's do this.
I'm doing what any man would do if he'd been offended. I'm stompin' your ass.
You idiot! You don't even know what you're fighting over!
You idiot! You don't even know what you're fighting over!
My honor, that's what I'm fighting over. Now get up off the ground, or do I have to whoop you where you lie?
Now, what's this?

Give it to me!
Mexico? You going to Mexico?

I'm leaving. You never have to see me again. Just please, give me the ticket!

Who the hell is this!?
Who the hell are you?
Who the hell are you?
I'm her husband.
Now who the hell are you, and it better be good, or God help me I'll break you in half.
Easy, chief. I... I was helping your wife. I met her in town. She needed a hand with her drapes. That's all.

A lot that means.

Grace, tell him.
You can't just walk in here and walk out, you sonufabitch! I'm gonna tear you a new asshole!
You broke my nose!
You broke my nose!
It ain't broke.
What the fuck do you want?
I'll give you a lift, son. Too hot to be walking... People die out here, y'know.
After you huffed off, Grace lied so bad, I got so pissed off, I pulled down her pants to paddle her ass raw and finger-fucked it instead. Sorry I lost my cool like that. It's a funny thing, women.
Yeah...
Yeah...
Say, what happened to your hand?

Got work. I know a man who's got a boat. Wants me to sail it for him.
You a sailor man? That'd be the life. Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away. A man could pretty well disappear like that. Just sail away until all he was was a memory. I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.

Wait a second--
Wait a second--
Ah, I can smell it on you.
Hey!
That's the sweat of a man who hasn't an honest bone in his body. Don't be offended, lad. A man who's got no ethics is a free man. I envy that. Beside, how can I blame you? That Grace sure has a mind of her own, and a body to match, don't she? Eh?
She does at that. I knew when I married her she was a free spirit. A woman with her looks and a man my age; what was I to expect? But you see a woman like that in a town like this and you don't think, you do. So, I married her. What are you to do, eh? Women.
Can't live with them, and you can't shoot 'em.
"You can't shoot 'em!" I like that. I bet she led you on good, didn't she? Taking you up to the house to hang drapes. Oh that's a good one. Bet she had you hard as a rock wiggling her ass in your face. I bet you just wanted to pull down her pants and hog her out. Then me busting in like some
Like you don't know.
Like you don't know.
Mad like a dog in heat, I bet you were. I can tell you got a temper on you.
Would you?
Would I what?
Would I what?
Would you kill her?
I've done a few things but I'm not a murderer, Mr. McKenna.
How do you know if you've never tried?
How do you know if you've never tried?
This is a joke, right? You just want to rattle me. Right?
What can I do for you, lad?
I was hoping we could talk.

About things. About your wife.

Sweet Grace? What about her?

About what you said this morning.
You said you had an insurance policy out on your wife. Fifty-thousand dollars.
I do.
I do.
You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.
You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.

Don't play simple with me, Jake. You're a betting man. You want me to spell it out for you? I'll kill Grace if you cut me in on the money.

Because you're a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money.
Because you're a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money.
And what does that make you?
And what does that make you?
The slimy bastard who's going to do it for you... You're a jealous man Jake. If you can't have Grace to yourself...well, you're not the sharing kind.
Well, I guess I have what you call a love-hate relationship with Grace.
You love her, but you hate her?
You love her, but you hate her?
No, I hate loving her. I hate the kind of person she is. I hate having to tolerate the little "games" she plays. Like fucking half of the town behind my back and laughing at me. The bitch. She loved to play. She wants me to hit her and when I hit her she likes it. She tortures me. But she's family. She's my
How much could you get?
Maybe ... ten-thousand. And that's a maybe.

I need thirteen.

That's a bit much.

We're not talking about buying a car Jake. We're talking about killing your wife. It's thirteen, or it's nothing.
You drive a hard bargain, but I had a feeling you were my boy when I met you.
I'm not your boy. I don't like you. I got no choice but to do business with you. Let's just call this a nasty little marriage of convenience.
I'm not your boy. I don't like you. I got no choice but to do business with you. Let's just call this a nasty little marriage of convenience.
Don't say that. I had a marriage of convenience with Grace, and look where that's lead... Well, looks like we got ourselves a contract.
If you can't trust the man you've hired to kill your wife ...? The thing is it's got to look like an accident; that's the thing. If it doesn't, then it's no good. I won't get a dime, and it's my neck that'll be on the chopping block while you're living it up somewhere.
How do you want it?
How do you want it?
How the hell should I know? I've never had a wife killed before. Jesus Christ! <u>You</u> want this job, you don't know how to do this? I guess I should have hired a professional.

You want to do this yourself? I don't have to do this, you know.
Be quiet, boy. I got to figure this thing. I'm thinking. It can't be done at the house. It should be...
Come to think of it, how 'bout some money upfront?
Oh yeah sure. Why don't I buy you a plane ticket right out of here while I'm at it. I <u>know you</u>... This is what you do: Go to the house to see her.
Oh yeah sure. Why don't I buy you a plane ticket right out of here while I'm at it. I <u>know you</u>... This is what you do: Go to the house to see her.
And tell her what?
...I don't know. Tell her you had to see her. Tell her you don't care if she's married or not, you had to be with her. Sweet talk the woman. A young buck like you must be good at that. Then ... maybe shift the conversation. Get her thinking about that jeep of hers. She loves that thing. Maybe the only thing she does
I know you're not surprised I'm back here, cause you can read my mind and all.
Next time you'll do just fine.
No!
That's my gun... That fucking Darrell!
I like Darrell. He may be an idiot, but he's my half brother. We own Harlin's together, yeah, that little redneck manages to get paid no matter how things work out.
I guess this is what they call "ironee"? Hunh?
It's not what you think, Jake.
It's not what you think, Jake.
No, but it don't matter anyway when you're lying there with your brains all over my carpet and I'm telling Sheriff Potter about this drifter, didn't have enough money to fix his car. And Darrell happened to find his gun, and through maybe this drifter heard old Jake got some money stashed away, and figgered he might try to break in and steal it!

Wait a minute. Just listen to me...
Wait a minute. Just listen to me...
...And he thought he'd clock old Jake McKenna and turn his brains into wall paper...and then maybe borrow $200 or $20,000, or $200,000...
I came for Grace.
You came to take my wife from me?
Shhh! Liar.
It's the truth, Jake.
It's the truth, Jake.
That's a thick change of heart from this afternoon.

Damn it, Jake. There is a guy coming to kill me, and if it comes down to me or Grace, then I pick Grace. You were going to give me thirteen-thousand. Give me two-hundred. I'll kill her and dump the body where no one will ever find it. She showed me the perfect place. There won't be enough left for an autopsy. But I
How the hell did you know where the bedroom's at?
What are you talking about!
Come on, Jake --
Don't Jake me boy! It's a big house. You probably didn't even make it out to the desert this afternoon...
You'd tell me anything to save your pathetic life.
You know what kind of woman Grace is, Jake. You know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of Superior. What's she to you, Jake; a woman who wants you dead? Let me kill her. All I want is two-hundred dollars to get out of here with.

And what would that be?
You flirt with me, then you run cold. You lead me on, then slap me down. I don't go for being jerked around.
Really? And what game did you want to play? You carry my box for me, and I fall into bed with you?

Yeah, but I like the sun. I grew up on a reservation. The sun, the desert; they like a religion to us. Jake's the same way. He loves the desert. I guess we're alike that way. That's about the only way.

No.
No.
Did you ever?
Did you ever?
Depends on what you call love. I grew up on a reservation. A patch of desert in the middle of nowhere. That's where they stick Indians, Bobby. That's where they leave us to die. My brother killed himself when he was 19 cause he couldn't take it anymore. There's no hope there... Jake was my ticket out. Mom and me.

I'm still here, aren't I? See this?
All this nothing? It doesn't get to Jake like it gets to me. He says he don't mind being nothing but a big fish in a small pond. More like a little fish in a dried up watering hole.
You could leave him.
You could leave him.
I don't know how.

You're sick too...he loved to do things to me. Control me. My Mom...it tore her up cause she couldn't do nothing about it. She become alcoholic...and the funny thing is-- I liked it. I liked being controlled by Jake. The truth was as far out and crazy as he got, I wanted <u>more</u>. I wanted to go all the way. Women say they don't
After he got his divorce, he forced me to marry him...but when I saw her body, I swore to her on my soul that some day I'd get Jake for what he did to her...

What do you mean?
What do you mean?
At night. He just sits there and laughs and talks to himself and counts it. I heard him. My Mom told me he had a hunnert thousand dollars down there. Maybe more.
In <u>cash</u>?
Oh yeah. There's nothing else with Jake. He don't trust banks. He keeps the money in the floor right under the bed. He loves it so much, he wouldn't think of spending any of it on me. I never seen it but I know he's got more than a hunnert thousand at least...

One-hundred-thousand!? That son-of-a-bitch.
It takes a key. He keeps it on himself all the time. I mean <u>all the time</u>. It scratches up against me when we do it.
If the key's on him, how do we get the key?
If the key's on him, how do we get the key?
Kill him.
I can't kill, Grace. I can't kill anybody.
It's not like he's a young man, Bobby. He's had time to live. It'd be quick. I mean, he wouldn't even have to <u>feel</u> it... I mean, sometime in the middle of the night, when it's quiet...when he's asleep, you could just come up behind him when he's pounding on me and...
I wanted to talk.
I don't think we have anything to talk about.

I don't give a damn about the money. I want you, and I want to get us out of this shithole. There's only one way to do that.
Are you sure?... About me, I mean?
I came back for you; this morning I came back. Before I even knew about the money. You're what I want. The only reason I stormed off is because you spooked me talking about Jake. But I've had nothing but time to think about it. It keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here. But we've got

You said you couldn't kill anybody.
You said you couldn't kill anybody.
We don't have to kill him. Just knock him out and tie him up 'till we get away. It was your idea, remember? I'm doing this for you. I'm doing this so you can fly...fly like a bird.
Grace ... Grace?
After dark. I'll leave the back door unlocked.
The money's right here! Get the key!
No! You get it!
Bobby? What the hell's the matter with you?
I ... nothing. I just stubbed my toe on a rock. Hurt like hell.
I ... nothing. I just stubbed my toe on a rock. Hurt like hell.
I got the money all packed. I put the jeep and his caddy in the garage. People'll think maybe me and Jake went away. Buy us some time...I know a back road we can take.

Good thinking. What's all this?
Good thinking. What's all this?
I'm not coming back.
I can't see it.
It should be just up ahead. Hold on ... there! There it is!
Hey! Take it easy. Want to get us killed?
You don't know what it feels like to be free of that place.
You don't know what it feels like to be free of that place.
I don't know about that?
I don't know about that?
You spent a day in Superior. I wasted my entire life there. I feel like someone just took a million pounds off my shoulders.

We've still got some dead weight to get rid of.

Can't we just dump him fast someplace?

I want a place where only the vultures will find him... It'll be over soon, Grace.

Then will you take me on your friends' boat with you?

I'm not sailing his boat.

But I thought --

We're going to buy a boat of our own baby, and sail it wherever we want to go.

Anywhere?
Anywhere?
What the hell? Why not? Where should we go?
What the hell? Why not? Where should we go?
Hawaii. I've read all about it. I've dreamed of going there and just lying on the beach while the water licked up against my feet. Oh, God. I'd kill to go there.
Hawaii. I've read all about it. I've dreamed of going there and just lying on the beach while the water licked up against my feet. Oh, God. I'd kill to go there.
You already have.
You know I thought you'd left me back there.
What are you talking about?
Get real Bobby. He was gonna kill you <u>and</u> me.
He was in love with you Grace. He would've done what you wanted, you could've made a deal and ...
He was in love with you Grace. He would've done what you wanted, you could've made a deal and ...
The only deal he had in mind was killing you for Jake's murder and blackmailing me into sucking his dick for the rest of my life... no thanks.

He was a <u>cop</u>, Grace, they never stop looking for you when you kill a cop...
He was a <u>cop</u>, Grace, they never stop looking for you when you kill a cop...
He was a scumbag!... He wanted <u>me</u>, Bobby. These guys don't let go! Even when they're <u>dead</u>... You don't know what it was like, Bobby. Those two, they were the same.
So, aren't you going to ask me?
Ask you what? You mean what kind of horrifying sick shit is coming next?
Ask you what? You mean what kind of horrifying sick shit is coming next?
Don't you want to know...? I bet it's burning a hole in your brain just now?
Don't you want to know...? I bet it's burning a hole in your brain just now?
Let it go, baby. It's the past. I got a past...
Let it go, baby. It's the past. I got a past...
Don't you really want to know? Was Jake my Daddy? Was I fucking my own Daddy? Don't you want to know that?
Why?
<u>I don't know why</u>!
No Grace, my hand's bothering me.
You think now that Jake's dead, there's all that money there and I don't need you anymore, and I might just sneak up behind you sometime and...pop!
Don't you think I would've done it if I wanted to? What can I do to make you relax, baby?
You could give me my gun back.
I think nothing happens. You're dead meat. That's it.
You don't believe in anything do you, Bobby?
You don't believe in anything do you, Bobby?
I believe in this moment, that's all. There is nothing else. Come on. He must weigh 300 pounds.
Well, nothing. We dump Jake, we split the money, then you're on your own.
Don't leave me. I want to say with you, Bobby.
Don't leave me. I want to say with you, Bobby.
Why? So when the cops catch up with us you can sell me out again?
Why? So when the cops catch up with us you can sell me out again?
I was just baiting him! Bobby, I had to tell him that to get his guard down. Just like you told Jake you was going to kill me!
I was just baiting him! Bobby, I had to tell him that to get his guard down. Just like you told Jake you was going to kill me!
You lied to me all along! Lies, all lies. Your mother, your father, what story are you on now? How come the town didn't know you was his daughter?
When you're finished with me, I'm next! I been there, baby. I been there with other cunts...sorry, not anymore. I'll take you as far as California. If we can make that. After that you're on your own. Try Mexico. With all this bread, you can live like a queen.
I don't want to go to Mexico, Bobby! Please, I really want to be with you. Don't blow this. Don't you think I care about you?
I don't want to go to Mexico, Bobby! Please, I really want to be with you. Don't blow this. Don't you think I care about you?
I think you're a lying, back-stabbing psycho bitch, and one day you'll kill me. But it's nice to know you cared...
Time to go for a walk, Jake.
My mother died in this canyon.
My mother died in this canyon.
Save the Mom routine, will ya Grace. It doesn't work with me. One, two, three...
Hope is a four-letter word.
But we all need that too. Hold him.
Thank you. Thank you. I...I knew you wouldn't leave me, Grace.
Bobby? Are you all right?
Bobby? Are you all right?
I busted my leg!
I busted my leg!
Can you make it back up?
Can you make it back up?
Grace -- in the trunk of my car is a tow rope. It should reach down here. Go get it, throw it down.
Why's that?
'Cause I love you.
And I love you too.
And love's a funny thing. Sometimes I don't know if I want to love you...
<u>Jake</u>...
He <u>can't</u> help you now, honey!
Morning, officer.
Son. Little excitement out at the reservation this morning. Wayne and Dale Elkhart were up drinking all night and then Wayne starts chasing Dale around the desert with his shotgun. BIA handled it. I went by for backup.
Where ya goin'?
Harlin's.
Harlin's.
Get in.
Seen you popping up a little bit of everywhere today. You're not planning on staying are you?
No, sir. I'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about.
No, sir. I'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about.
That's a nasty cut you got there.
That's a nasty cut you got there.
Yeah, fell down and hit a rock. Not as bad as it looks.
Yeah, fell down and hit a rock. Not as bad as it looks.
There was a young fellow over at Jamilla's today when it got hit. Way she tells it he got whacked around good by one of the robbers.

Sounds like it. I wish I could help Sheriff, but I just want to get my car and get on up the road.
That's a shame, Bobby. A real shame.
And that's not the half of it, Mr. Arkadin...
And that's not the half of it, Mr. Arkadin...
"Arkady"
"Arkady"
Right, Mr. Arkady. And that's not the half of it. I got your money, and I go into this little grocery store in this hicktown to get something to eat and then... well, it gets <u>robbed</u>!
Right, Mr. Arkady. And that's not the half of it. I got your money, and I go into this little grocery store in this hicktown to get something to eat and then... well, it gets <u>robbed</u>!
...And let me guess. This robber -- he gets your money.
...And let me guess. This robber -- he gets your money.
No. Two of them. Two robbers. And they <u>both</u> get nailed... get shot by the old lady.
No. Two of them. Two robbers. And they <u>both</u> get nailed... get shot by the old lady.
The old lady?
The old lady?
With a <u>shotgun</u>! She kills <u>both</u> of 'em, and... and the money in my bag gets all shredded to bloody pieces. Not one bill is left alive. I mean, what are the odds?
Mr. Arkady, honest, I ad to beat it outta there before the cops showed. So now I don't have a cent to my name. I can't even get my car out of the garage. I tell you, Mister... if it weren't for bad luck I wouldn't have nay fuckin' luck at all, you know? So, I was wondering if you could wire me a
Which you don't have.
Which you don't have.
But which I can get. No problem. Look, I can sell my car in Vegas. Blue book it's worth 16 at least. I just need the 150, uh...
Yeah, if you could send it care of...
...Now, let me get this straight. Two years you give me problems with your fuckin' payoffs. Now you owe me thirteen-thousand dollars, you call me - collect - then ask me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed.
...Now, let me get this straight. Two years you give me problems with your fuckin' payoffs. Now you owe me thirteen-thousand dollars, you call me - collect - then ask me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed.
A hundred-forty-five would probably cover it.
A hundred-forty-five would probably cover it.
A hundred and ... Now you listen to me you deadbeat little punk: I don't care if you got hit by a truck and run over by a steamroller. You owe me thirteen-thousand dollars and <u>I want it</u>. I don't care how you get it, or where from, but I want it on my desk tomorrow, or I'll show you what real bad luck
What'd you say to me!
Shit I'm sorry!...you can't believe the strain I'm under. I'm just under a lot of strain here.
I need a ticket.
Where to?
Where to?
Out of here.
Out of here.
But, in particular?
But, in particular?
I ... Mexico. You got a bus that goes to Mexico? That's where I have to go.
I ... Mexico. You got a bus that goes to Mexico? That's where I have to go.
Mexico is a large country. Where in Mexico would you like--
Mexico is a large country. Where in Mexico would you like--
I don't care, just get me there.
How about Ciudad Juarez? You could take a local, arrives in two hours, and transfer in Albuquerque. It'll get you across the border.
How much?
How much?
One way, or round trip?
One way, or round trip?
One way.
One way.
30.55. Twenty more will get you back.
Twenty-seven, fifty. That's all I got.
The ticket is 30.55.
Keep your change. Bus three-twenty-three. Leaves at seven fifty two, tonight.
I'm sorry. It's just ... you know ...
You got a beer?

No. Just plain ol' Miller. Now you can fuckin' take it or you can fuckin' leave it.
No. Just plain ol' Miller. Now you can fuckin' take it or you can fuckin' leave it.
I'll fuckin' take it. To go.
Shasta! Now why'd you go and scare the nice man like that? Sorry about that, mister. Let's see, you want $3.25. You try to have a nice day now, would you?
Sure, I'll try.
My lord, that little baby of yours Virgil, has gotten cuter'n a bunny's nose.
What was that all about?
What was that all about?
You know how that Toby is. Thinks every man he sees is after his Jenny.
You know how that Toby is. Thinks every man he sees is after his Jenny.
More like Jenny is after every man she sees.
Let me get your change.
Flo, I'm just gonna help myself to a refill on the coffee.
Son of a bitch!
Virgil! Now look at what you done! Are you all right?
Virgil! Now look at what you done! Are you all right?
I think I burned my gun hand!
Morning Grace.
Morning Sheriff. Got my drapes.
Morning Sheriff. Got my drapes.
Well it's about time. Looks like you found yourself a helper too.
Well, he offered, and I just couldn't refuse. His car overheated.
Oh?
Anybody hurt?
Hell, no. That Wayne can't shoot when he's sober, much less drunk. He's lucky he didn't kill his own danged self. Well, anyhow, you stay cool. Nice meeting you, son.
You fuck this guy -- get him to do your dirty work and you think you can take the money and dump me?
No baby, you got it wrong.
No baby, you got it wrong.
This road don't go to Globe, Grace -- where were you going to meet me?
I don't want the fuckin' money! I'm not gonna give up everything I got for a lousy 50,000 dollars. It's <u>you</u>. You <u>Grace</u> or nothing. The whole thing... I want you to be my wife.... What do you way Grace?
You sound just like Jake... I did see into the future, Virgil, but you weren't in it. Go back to your family. They love you.
Goddamnit Virgil, stop! Don't!
...But I bet the story she <u>didn't</u> tell you was the best story of all. How old crazy Jake <u>was really her Papa</u>. And she <u>liked</u> fucking Papa! And now she's killed the sonufabitch! Just like she's gonna kill you!
Who was that on the phone?
Wrong number.
Wrong number.
You spent a long time talking for a wrong number. But then you make friends so easily. Don't you, Grace?
I put up new drapes, Jake.
I know. I was here when your apprentice was helping you. Remember?
I know. I was here when your apprentice was helping you. Remember?
You never said anything. About the drapes.
You never said anything. About the drapes.
They look nice.
They look nice.
You haven't even looked at them once.
They look nice.
I picked them out for you, Jake. I thought you would like the colors.
What the hell you looking at, girl?
Nothing, Jake. Absolutely nothing.
Ya little bitch, you like it don't you! You like it this way -- rough and hard. Gotta go fuck around on me, like your Mama, but you always gotta come home to Daddy, don't you, cause you know Daddy's the best.
Yes, yes, hit me...beat me, please.
Yes, yes, hit me...beat me, please.
You been a bad girl, Grace. You took my heart from your Mama, didn't ya? You betrayed her! Like you did me. There ain't no forgivin' ya, girl!
You been a bad girl, Grace. You took my heart from your Mama, didn't ya? You betrayed her! Like you did me. There ain't no forgivin' ya, girl!
Oh no! Oh please forgive me, Papa!
Oh no! Oh please forgive me, Papa!
You broke her heart! You broke your Mama's heart. You stole me! That's right. Fuck it away. But it ain't ever goin' away, cause your Mama -- she's like a hungry ghost baby, she won't go away, she won't leave ya alone.

No! No! Please!
What's the matter?
You didn't hear something?
You didn't hear something?
Yeah, I heard a key slapping against my ass.
Yeah, I heard a key slapping against my ass.
There's someone in the house.
Jake, don't go out there. Call the sheriff.
Shhhh! Just like your Mama, always scared of things...
Help me, Grace, help...
Like you helped her, Jake?
I axed you a question.
Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing. We was just talking.
Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing. We was just talking.
You shut your mouth, girl, and get back over to our table. Now, I'm not going to axe you again, Mister. What were you doing with my girl?
Honest, Toby. I just axed him for a quarter for the jukebox.
Stay out of this, Jenny. We got man's business to take care of. I ain't never taken no drugs, mister, and ...
I want to stay.
I said come on!
Toby! Toby Tucker, leave him alone!
You stay away, Jenny. I aim to mess him up, and that ain't a thing for a woman to see.
Where's the fire sweetheart? Don't know how they work things in Nevada, but we got speed limits in this state.
Vat? I am going 5 miles an hour! I am looking town. I not even moving.
Whoa, what kind of accent you got there? You one of them Russians?
I am Russian, da! I am also <u>rich</u> Russian, da? Maybe we work something out, my friend Sheriff?
I am Russian, da! I am also <u>rich</u> Russian, da? Maybe we work something out, my friend Sheriff?
What? You trying to bribe me, mister? Just cause you Russians ain't commies anymore, don't think money can buy everything...
What's that? ..."concealed" is a definite no no in this town, Ivan. You know anything about Jamilla's grocery store?
What fuckin grocery store, you fucking shithead idiot! You call yourself a police...
Get out of the car, spread them. You can jawbone all you want or you have the right to <u>shut the fuck up</u>! You commie motherfucker. Either way you're goin' to the can.
I want my lawyer!
Yes?
Is Noel in?
Is Noel in?
No sir he is not. I read about you in the paper.
No sir he is not. I read about you in the paper.
Oh.
Oh.
I was in an accident once too. A horse almost trampled me to death.
I was in an accident once too. A horse almost trampled me to death.
Wow.
Wow.
I had to put him down.
Proceed.
Ask if he can check how many sick days I've taken since I've worked here?
Is that the entire message?
Yes.
Wrap it up.
You've made a considerably wise decision.
Once again please?
My son Jeb. It's a gift for him.
My son Jeb. It's a gift for him.
How old is Jeb?
How old is Jeb?
Four.
Four.
No.
No, no, no, no no... You need to go now.
What did I say?
What did I say?
Do you see any Telletubbies around here?... Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it?... Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression sitting outside in a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put a quarter in it?... No?... Well that's what you see at a toy store? Any you must think
I'm listening.
I'll keep it in my office room.
I'll keep it in my office room.
What about Jeb?
What about Jeb?
I have a lock on the door.
I don't think I got the job in New York.
What does that mean?
What does that mean?
I'm still going to New York. Just not this second.
I'm still going to New York. Just not this second.
I don't want to drag this out too long for Jeremy.
I don't want to drag this out too long for Jeremy.
I know.
Is Jeremy okay?
He's asleep.
He's asleep.
Oh.
I don't know. It's been a while.
I haven't been sick this year. I know that.
I haven't been sick this year. I know that.
Okay.
Okay.
Do you remember me getting sick?
Do you remember me getting sick?
Not a specific day. What's this about?
Not a specific day. What's this about?
Megan, do you ever remember me getting sick?
...I can't remember.
That's strange isn't it? Not remembering one fever... Or a cold... Or a sore throat. What do you think that means?
That's strange isn't it? Not remembering one fever... Or a cold... Or a sore throat. What do you think that means?
It means we're probably to tired to remember.
Is that what you wanted to ask me?
Yes.
Yes.
Is there anything else you wanted to ask me while I'm up?... When was the last time you wore pink? When was the last time you drank soup standing up? Final call for strange questions at two in the morning.
Is there anything else you wanted to ask me while I'm up?... When was the last time you wore pink? When was the last time you drank soup standing up? Final call for strange questions at two in the morning.
No that's it.
When was the last time I wore pink?
The Mitchell barbecue three years ago.
The Mitchell barbecue three years ago.
Oh shit...
Oh shit...
Matching shirt and shorts. It was brutal.
I've come to a decision.
Oh.
Megan?
Yes. Is this David?
Yes. Is this David?
Yeah? Megan where are you calling from?
Yeah? Megan where are you calling from?
My name is Megan Inverso. We went to college together.
I remember you.
I was hoping you would call me, but... Anyway I decided not to wait. I was thinking, it might be nice to go to dinner together.
...When you work with clients on machines, do they sometimes just jump up a level or two? Do something they didn't know they were capable of?
Not often, but it is possible. Most people get scared when they see the shadow of their limits. They don't know how long the shadow really is. They don't know how far away the real limits are standing... They stop out of fear.
What do I do when I'm around someone I know?
You use your sleeve.
He's just laying in bed. He's pretty upset. He won't talk.
He's dealing with a lot of things. I think he needs to find answers himself.
Would you like to try going--
Yes.
Yes.
out again?
Oh. Elijah Price came to visit me at the center today.
Jesus.
He didn't do anything. He just told me his theory... It's sad when patients get like that. They loose reality.
Jeremy what the hell are you doing?
...I think rust.
Rust?
Rust?
As a color, not as rust. You know, a rust colored paint or wood?
I didn't know that. Mine's still brown.
My turn. What's your favorite song?
My turn. What's your favorite song?
Soft and Wet, by the Artist Formerly Known as Prince.
Soft and Wet, by the Artist Formerly Known as Prince.
What was that?
What was that?
We're supposed to be honest.
Soft and Wet. That's very interesting.
My turn. When was the first time the thought popped into your head that we might not make it?
I'm not sure.
Think carefully?
Think carefully?
What about the game?
What about the game?
It's finished. I won.
Maybe it wasn't a specific moment, maybe it--
I had a nightmare one night and I didn't wake you up so you could tell me it was okay. I think that was the first time. Does that count?
I had a nightmare one night and I didn't wake you up so you could tell me it was okay. I think that was the first time. Does that count?
That counts.
Why?
I don't know Megan.
I don't know Megan.
It's like you resent us David. Resent the life you have.
You've never been sick?
I don't know for sure. ...I don't think so.
How certain are you that you haven't been sick in your life?
Seventy-five percent.
Seventy-five percent.
Seventy-five percent? That's not nearly good enough for me. I'm extremely skeptical.
Seventy-five percent? That's not nearly good enough for me. I'm extremely skeptical.
Skeptical about what?
Skeptical about what?
Your answer to my question. It's one thing to have never been injured in your life, but to state that you've never taken ill, well that's a whole new level.
What's he talking about?
In college. A car accident.
In college. A car accident.
Was it serious?
I assumed because of the train.
You assumed wrong.
You forgot the "Now I'm going to tell you what the hell is going on" step. See usually that comes before the, "It's over" Step. And it always, always comes before the "You can go" Step. What is over?
The life of an idea that has lived too long in my head.
This city has had its share of disasters. Well publicized ones. It was around the time of that plane crash, when it first entered my head. And there it stayed, as I waited and watched the news over the years... And then one day I see a news report on a train accident and its sole survivor who was miraculously unharmed. And just like
What was your idea Elijah?
At the church... You were following me weren't you?
Technically no. I gambled that you would attend the church service. I just waited for you.
What's this about? This is obviously some scam. Is this where you tell me one of those pictures is like an investment?
You've misunderstood.
You've misunderstood.
I see guys like you all the time in my work. You find someone you think is emotionally vulnerable and you tell them a fantastic story, utterly convincing... and somewhere in there, you slip it in... 'I just need your credit card number','I just need a small down payment.'
It's for last week's game.
I've come to understand that... An ill advised purchase in the parking lot.
What do you want?
Not money. But I appreciate your healthy cynicism in the manner. It will be wise for both of us to proceed with greatest caution.
Not money. But I appreciate your healthy cynicism in the manner. It will be wise for both of us to proceed with greatest caution.
We're not proceeding anywhere together.
We're not proceeding anywhere together.
We've already begun.
Why is it, do you think, that of all the professions in the world... you chose protection?
Are you for real?
Are you for real?
You could have poured coffee in Starbucks, you could have learned to install track lighting in office buildings, you could have told people their horoscopes on the internet... You could have been one of ten thousand things... but in the end, you chose to protect people. You made that decision... and I find that very, very interesting. Now all I need is your credit
Just give me a minute.
Is there a problem?
Is there a problem?
That guy in green. Sometimes people carry weapons in here. Then they drink too much. They're team isn't doing so well, bad things happen... We do random pat downs of the crowd to discourage people from carrying. If he's carrying, he'll step out of line.
I got you a seat in the seven hundred level. It's nose-bleed territory, but at least you won't get spit on.
How did you know that man you bumped was carrying a weapon?
How did you know that man you bumped was carrying a weapon?
Probably the army jacket. Those guys carry hunting knives and stuff for show.
Probably the army jacket. Those guys carry hunting knives and stuff for show.
You thought he was carrying a knife?
I thought he was carrying something.
But not a knife?
But not a knife?
I got this picture of a silver handled gun tucked in his pants. Like on t.v.
You have good instincts when it comes to things like that?
Like what?
Like what?
Telling when people have done something wrong?
Yes.
Have you ever tried to develop it?
Have you ever tried to develop it?
I don't know what you're asking?
I don't know what you're asking?
You're skill.
Listen. I got to be on the sidelines during the game... You can get to your seat by taking the stairwell at--
Characters in comic books are often attributed special powers. X-ray vision, things of that sort.
Okay, I don't want to play this game anymore.
It's an exaggeration of the truth. Maybe it's based on something as simple as instinct. Like being able to touch someone and tell whether they've done something wrong... Or the level of what they've done wrong.

Or he might have been carrying a silver handled gun tucked in his pants.
I have to go now.
One last question.
Quick.
The car accident you were in... Was there anyone else involved?
I must have felt some lump in his back when I bumped him. Most guns have a black or silver handle. I had a fifty-fifty shot at the color.
That's not what I witnessed David.

You have a problem, Elijah. My wife is right. Somewhere along the line one of your bones broke and your mind just broke with it.
Are you finished?
No. And I have been sick. I spent a week in a hospital when I was a boy recovering from pneumonia and almost drowning. Two skinny eight year old kids were playing around the pool. They were dunking me. I swallowed water. They didn't know it and they almost killed me. Heroes don't get killed like that. Normal people do.

Not really.
This kid is six foot two, two hundred and forty pounds. He runs the fifty in under six seconds. He's going to be a God.
Yeah, hello.
Is David Dunne there?
He doesn't look very threatening.
That's what I said to my son. He said, there's always two kinds. The soldier villain who fights the hero with his hands, and then there's the real threat. The brilliant and evil arch enemy who fights the hero with his mind.
How are you feeling?
Okay.

...See my husband was a big football star in college and we were in an accident together. Our car flipped on an icy road. We were both injured. He couldn't play football anymore. If that hadn't happened, we wouldn't have been together.

How so?
How so?
Football wasn't the kind of life I wanted... For ten years I'd be by the phone waiting for a call telling me he broke his neck in a practice game. And if it wasn't that call, it would be a call telling me he blew out his knee or suffered his third concussion. I've seen way too much of it in my job... I

I'm not going out anymore. I'm not getting hurt again. This was the last time. I told you.
You can't do anything about that. You might fall between that chair and this television. If that's what God has planned for you, that's what's going to happen. You can't hide from it in your room.

Some folks did call Old Corky "Two Gun" but not because he was sportin' two pistols but because he had a dick so big it was longer than the barrel on that Walker Colt he carried. An' the only insultin' he done was stickin' that big dick of his in some French Lady that Old Bob was sweet on... Well, one day Corky walked
Well, that bullet whizzin' by panicked Corky, an' he done the wrong thing! Pulled his gun in such a damn hurry he shot off his own toe.

And?
And?
Bam! That Walker Colt blew up in his hand... which was a failing common to that model. Now if Corky would have really had two guns instead of just a big dick he could have defended himself to the end.

Oh, them. Hell, I seen them.
You was right to change your mind, Kid.

How many you killed, Kid?
How many you killed, Kid?
Five. I killed five of 'em. That counts a Mexican I killed. He come at me with a knife.
Jesus. You done this before?
Plenty of times.
His pistol must of jammed.
Move the candle closer, I can't see.
Move the candle closer, I can't see.
He wouldn't of took no beating like that if it hadn't of jammed. He wouldn't just give it over an' not shoot no one.
He didn't even pull his pistol, huh?
He ain't as tough as you, Kid.
He ain't as tough as you, Kid.
Well, I guess I woulda at least pulled my pistol an...

You can stop looking. There was no coke. I've been in L.A. county with a guy they
There was ninety-one million -
We know, but our man says no way on the dope. This Hungarian tells me the whole bunch was pulling stumps for Turkey the next' day. They had no time to negotiate that kind of product and no means to move it.

He didn't know. No one doing the deal knew except a few key people. This guy says they were real hush about it. Whatever it was it was highly sensitive.

Who ?
Who ?
Bear with me here...
A boy came across a body on the beach this morning. Thrown clear when the boat burned. Shot once in the head. Two guys from the F.B.I. just identified him. +
And ?
Keyser Soze
There's more.
&lt;&lt;We were there to buy a man and take him back to Hungary.&gt;&gt;
He says they were buying It doesn't make sense. I'm sorry, I'm a little rusty. They were there to buy something.
Not dope. Something else. Some what?.. He doesn't knob what they were buying. But not dope... people.
&lt;&lt;I'll tell you everything. I'11 even say it slow enough for you to understand it. Just tell this man I want protection. Real protection.&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;No, no, no. I need a guarantee from the ridiculous man. I am going to be killed. I have seen the Devil and looked him in the eye.&gt;&gt;
No good. He needs guarantees. He says... his life is in danger... He has seen the Devil... looked him in the eye.
&lt;&lt;Keyser Soze. Keyser Sate. I've seen his face. I see it when I close my eyes.&gt;&gt;
He says he knows his face. He sees it when he closes his eyes.
&lt;&lt;It was smaller than that. Sharper.&gt;&gt;
+ The nose is sharper. Smaller too. + &lt;&lt;And what about the hair? You said something earlier about it.&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;Are you sure?&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;Are you sure?&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;Don't be stupid.&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;Don't be stupid.&gt;&gt;
He says the hair is longer and lighter.
Now remember, this is another kind of business. They don't earn your respect. You owe it to them. Don't stare them down but don't look away either. Confidence. They are fools not to trust you. That's the attitude.
I'm having a stroke.
I'm having a stroke.
You've come far. You're a good man. I love you.
...and the desk Sergeant is actually trying to tell me he can't release you? Can you believe that? You weren't even charged. New York police - Jesus. I want to take pictures of your face to bring to the D.A. first thing in the morning.
Just forget about it.
I'11 have this thing in front of a grand jury by Monday.
Edie, please. I don't want to hear this right now. What did Renault and Fortier say?
Edie, please. I don't want to hear this right now. What did Renault and Fortier say?
They want more time to think about investing.
They want more time to think about investing.
Goddamnit.
Goddamnit.
They just said they wanted time.
They just said they wanted time.
Time for what, Edie? Time to look into me a little more, that's what. No matter how well you cover my tracks now, they'll find out who I am.
Give me some credit. I got you this far, let's go to the grand jury. This is never going to stop if we -
No. It's never going to stop, period. It won't take more than a week before every investor in this city is walking away from us. It's finished. I'm finished.
Don't give up on me now, Dean.
They'll never stop.
They'll never stop.
I love you.
I love you.
They ruined me tonight.
They ruined me tonight.
Dean, I love you. Do you hear me?
Come home, Dean.
Alright.
That's enough, Edie.
I don't know what you came here for, but we won't have any part of it.
I don't know what you came here for, but we won't have any part of it.
Edie, please.
I know who he is.
I hope I didn't disturb you.
I hope I didn't disturb you.
I hope so, too, Mr. Kint. Can I get you something to drink?
I hope so, too, Mr. Kint. Can I get you something to drink?
A glass of water would be nice.
So what is it you do, Mr. Kint?
Umm ...
Umm ...
A hijacker like Dean, here? Or something more creative?
I'd say you've gotten on his main and central nerve, McManus.
Do your friend a favor, Fenster, keep him quiet .
Forget him. It's not important. I was trying to make a point.
This whole thing was a shakedown.
How many times have you been in a line- up? It's always you and four dummies. The P.D. pays homeless guys ten bucks a head half the time. No way they'd line five felons in the same row. No way. And what the hell is a voice line-.up? A public defender could get you off of that.
So why the hell was I hauled in and cavity searched tonight?
So why the hell was I hauled in and cavity searched tonight?
It was the Feds. A truck load of guns gets snagged, Customs comes down on N.Y.P.D. for some answers - they come up with us. They're grabbing at straws. It's politics - nothing you can do.

I had a guy's fingers in my asshole tonight.
Fuck you. I'11 never shit right again. So who did it? Own up.
I don't want to know.
This is not right.
I don't know. Who was that guy that used to talk about Soze in New York?
Yeah. He said he did jobs for him. Indirect stuff. Always five times more money than the job was worth.
Come on. The guy is a pipe dream. This Kobayashi is using him for window dressing .
Come on. The guy is a pipe dream. This Kobayashi is using him for window dressing .
I don't know. This is bad.
You're fuckin' A right, no P.C. Well screw P.C. No right. No goddamn right. You do some time, they never let you go. Treat me like a criminal, I'll end up a criminal.
You are a criminal.
You are a criminal.
Why you gotta go and do that? I'm trying to make a point.
I'm sure you can understand my hesitation.
Then who goes?
Then who goes?
We all go. How about it, Keaton?
DON'T MOVE, YOU FUCKERS.
RIGHT THERE. FREEZE.
Everybody I ever worked with, did time with.
They fucking know everything.
It's bullshit. This guy could be L.A.P.D. I think it's a setup.
The way I hear it, Soze is some kind of butcher. No pity.
You heard right.
The word I got is you hung up your spurs, man. What's that all about?
He's alright.
How do I know that? How about it, pretzel-man? What's your story?
How do I know that? How about it, pretzel-man? What's your story?
His name is Verbal Kint. I thought you guys knew him.
Why don't you just calm down'
What do you care what he says?
Keaton, we gotta go. They're gonna find him.
Dig.
It's a logistical nightmare. Close quarters, no advance layout, ten men, maybe twenty.
Can we stealth these guys?
Can we stealth these guys?
Doubtful. With all that coke, they'll be ready - which brings me to sunny spot number two. Even if one of us gets through and jacks the boat, we get nothing.
I know you. You don't think I know you're on the take. This whole fucking precinct is dirty. You don't have a fucking leg to stand on.
Hockney was just a bad bastard. Good with explosives. Mean as a snake when it mattered .
Roger really. People say I talk too much.
Yeah, I was gonna tell you to shut up.
What are we gonna do?
I can run. I got no problem with that.
Me too.
Did you hear what he just said?

If I'm going in, I want a stake.
We've met once or twice. Last time was in...

They're gonna do a job. Three million dollars, maybe more.
Get out.
If you'll just let me -
Don't hurt me.
Hurt you, you sonofabitch? I could kill you.
They - That's bullshit. They don't operate anymore.
McManus has a friend in the Fourteenth Precinct. They're coming out for one job - Thursday. They're picking up a guy smuggling emeralds out of South America. Fenster and McManus have a fence set to take the stuff.
What fence? Who?
Some guy in California. His name is Redfoot.
Some guy in California. His name is Redfoot.
Never heard of him.
You have to come.
What's with you? What do you care whether I come or not?
They - They don't know me. You do. They won't take me unless you go. Look at me. I need this.
Tough break.
Tough break.
Don't tell me you don't need this. Is this your place?
You watch your mouth.
Okay, okay. You say it's the real thing? That's cool.
I was out of line.
You okay?
You okay?
I'11 be alright.
I'11 be alright.
Well, I'm sorry.
Well, I'm sorry.
Forget it. I'11 probably shit blood tonight.
How are they going to do it?
McManus wants to go in shooting. I said no way.
McManus wants to go in shooting. I said no way.
Fenster and Hockney?
Fenster and Hockney?
They're pretty pissed off. They'll do anything. Now I got a way to do it without killing anyone: but like I said, they won't let me in without you.

Three million?

Not if we do it my way.
We'll make it.
Don't do this. Send her a card - something.
Don't do this. Send her a card - something.
We'll make it.
What is it Keaton?
Something - I don't know. I ever tell you about the restaurant I wanted to open?
What is this?
Who's Keyser Soze?
What-are they speaking?
Russian, I think. I don't know.
Russian, I think. I don't know.
Hungarian?
Keaton, I can't just -
I want you to find Edie. Both of you find some place safe. Tell her what happened - Everything. She knows people. She'll know what to do. If we can't get Kobayashi my way, she'll get him her way.

What if I

Just do what I tell you.
How are you, Keaton?
I'd have to say my spine was broken, Keyser.
Ready?
What time is it?
Let's say for example -
This I had to see myself.
with what?
You know damn well, dead-man.
You know damn well, dead-man.
Hey, that was your mistake, not mine. Did you ever think to ask me? I've been

I work for Keyser Sate.
You set up the line-up.
Mr. Soze made a few calls, yes. You were not to be released until I came to see you. It seems Mr. Keaton's attorney, Ms. Finneran, was a bit too effective in expediting his release. Holding the rest of you became a moot point.

What about Redfoot?
What about Redfoot?
Mr. Redfoot knew nothing. Mr. Soze rarely t works with the same people for very long, and they never know who they're working for. One cannot be betrayed if one has no people.
The answer is no.
Mr. Soze will be most -
Mr. Soze will be most -
Listen to me, cocksucker. There is no Keyser Sate. If you say his name again, I'11 kill you right here.
Listen to me, cocksucker. There is no Keyser Sate. If you say his name again, I'11 kill you right here.
A strange threat. I can only assume you're here to kill me anyway. Pity about Mr. Redfoot.
Ahh, Mr. Hockney. Do join us.
We know you can get to us, and now you know we can get to you. I'm offering you the chance to call this off.

I am sorry, Mr. McManus. f implore you to believe me, Mr. Keaton. Mr. Soze is very real and very + determined.
We'll see.
What did you say?
Edie Finneran. She is upstairs in my office for an extradition deposition. I requested she be put on the case personally. She flew out yesterday.
No matter. Kill away, Mr. McManus.
You're lying.

The D.A. came down here last night ready to arraign before they even moved him to county. Kint's lawyer comes in and five minutes later, the D.A. comes out looking like he'd been bitch-slapped by the boogey man. They took his statement and cut him a deal.

Even if I was to let you talk to him, he won't talk to you. He's paranoid about being recorded and he knows the interrogation rooms are wired
This won't be an' interrogation, just a... friendly chat to kill time.
No, no, no, no, no.

That's crazy, Dave and it doesn't matter. He has total immunity and his story checks out. He doesn't know what you want to know.
I don't think he does. Not exactly, but there's a lot more to his story. I want to know why twenty-seven men died on that pier for what looks to be ninety-one million dollars worth of dope that wasn't there. Above all, I want to be sure that Dean Keaton is dead.
His name was Arturo Marquez. A petty smuggler out of Argentina. He was arrested in New York last year for trafficking. He escaped to California and got picked up in Long Beach. They were setting up his extradition when he escaped again. Get this - Edie Finneran was called in to advise the proceedings.

There's nothing in there about Ruby.
I'11 be sure to mention that to him.
The first thing I learned on the job, know what it was? How to spot a murderer. Let's say you arrest three guys for the same killing. Put them all in jail overnight. The next morning, whoever is sleeping is your man. If you're guilty, you know you're caught, you get some rest - let your guard down, you follow?
No.
No.

That was all Fenster and McManus.
Come on. Keaton was a cop for four years. Who else would know the Taxi Service

I don't think you do. But you say you saw Keaton die. I think you're covering his ass and he's still out there somewhere. I think he was behind that whole circus in the harbor.

You think I don't know you held out on the D.A.? What did you leave out of that testimony? I can be on the phone to Ruby Deemer in ten minutes.
The D.A. gave me immunity.
The D.A. gave me immunity.
NOT FROM ME, YOU PIECE OF SHIT. THERE IS NO IMMUNITY FROM ME. You atone with me or the world you live in becomes the hell you fear in the back of your tiny mind. Every criminal I have put in prison,
There was a lawyer. Kobayashi.
Is he the one that killed Keaton?
Is he the one that killed Keaton?
No. But I'm sure Keaton's dead.
No. But I'm sure Keaton's dead.
Convince me. Tell me every last detail. 52 SCENE DELETED 52 53 INT. HOSPITAL - DAY 53 + Kovash's room is now filled with people. Jack Baer stands next to DANIEL METZHEISER, a balding man in his forties. Next to him is Doctor Plumber. Across from her is Ridgly Waiters.
So this lawyer...
Kobayashi.
Kobayashi.
Came from Redfoot.
Came from Redfoot.
Right.
Right.
And why leave this out when you talked to the D.A.?
Do you believe in him, Verbal?
Keaton always said: &quot;I don't believe in God, but I'm afraid of him.&quot; Well I believe in God, and the only thing that scares me is Keyser SOZE.
I came clean. I told it like it happened on the boat. So what if I left out how I got there? It's got so many holes in it, the D.A. would've told me to blow amnesty out my ass. So you got what you wanted out of me. Big fucking deal.
And this is why you never told the D.A.
And this is why you never told the D.A.
You tell me, Agent Kujan. If I told you the Loch Ness Monster hired me to hit the harbor, what would you say?
You tell me, Agent Kujan. If I told you the Loch Ness Monster hired me to hit the harbor, what would you say?
Turn state's evidence. Take the stand on this and we'll hear it out.
I've got immunity now. What can you possibly offer me?
If there is a Keyser Soze he'll be looking for you.
If there is a Keyser Soze he'll be looking for you.
Where's your head, Agent Kujan? Where do you think the pressure's coming from? Keyser Soze - or whatever you want to call him - knows where I am right now. He's got the front burner under' your ass to let me go so he can scoop me up ten minutes later. Immunity was just to deal with you assholes. I got a whole new

Gee, thanks, Dave. Bang-up job so far. Extortion, coercion. You'll pardon me if I ask you to kiss my pucker. The same fuckers that rounded us up and sank us into this mess are telling me They'll bail me out? Fuck you. You think you can catch Keyser Soze? You think a guy like that comes this close to getting fingered and sticks his
That was how I ended up in a barber shop quartet in Skokie, Illinois.
This is totally irrelevant.
This is totally irrelevant.
Oh, but it's not. If I hadn't been nailed in Illinois for running a three card monte in between sets, I never would have took off for New York. I never would have met Keaton, see. That barber shop quartet was the reason for everything.

Can we just get back to Kobayashi?
Can we just get back to Kobayashi?
The quartet is part of the bit about Kobayashi. The quartet was in my file, along with every other thing I had done since high school, see? Aliases, middle- men. They knew me better than I did. They knew all of us.
You're stalling, Verbal.
Give a guy a break, huh?
Give a guy a break, huh?
What happened?
Then what?
McManus was furious. He was talking about tracking him down and ripping his heart out and all sorts of shit. That night we got the call.

Kobayashi told us where we could find Fenster.
I wanted to. I thought we could make it.
Why didn't you say anything?
Why didn't you say anything?
I tried, believe me, but Keaton wouldn't have it. It was too far-fetched for him. Keaton was a grounded guy. An ex-cop. To a cop, the explanation is never that complicated. It's always simple. There's
A man in a suit with a slim build. Tall.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
I don't have a minute. Are you saying it was Keyser Soze? You told the D.A. you didn't know who it was.
Don't shine me, Verbal. No more stalling. You know what I'm getting at.
I don't.
I don't.
YES YOU DO. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GETTING AT. THE TRUTH. TRY TO TELL ME YOU DIDN'T KNOW. TRY TO TELL ME YOU SAW SOMEONE KILL KEATON .
TRY TO REEF LYING TO ME NOW. I KNOW EVERYTHING .
I don't know what you're talking about.
I don't know what you're talking about.
YOU KNOW. YOU'VE KNOWN THIS WHOLE FUCKING TIME. GIVE IT TO ME.
I don't understand what you're saying. I saw Keaton get shot, I swear to you.
Then why didn't you help him?
Then why didn't you help him?
I WAS AFRAID, OKAY? Somehow, I was sure it was Keyser Soze at that point. I couldn't bring myself to raise my gun to him.

But Keaton...
But Keaton...
It was Keyser Soze, Agent Kujan. I mean the Devil himself. How do you shoot the Devil in the back?
He was a stool pigeon for the Justice Department. He swore out a statement to Federal Marshals that he had seen and could positively identify one Keyser Soze and had intimate knowledge of his business, including, but not exclusive to, drug trafficking and murder.
I never heard of him.
I never heard of him.
His own people were selling him to a gang of Hungarians. Most likely the same Hungarians that Sate all but wiped out back in Turkey. The money wasn't there for dope. The Hungarians were going to buy the one guy that could finger Soze for them.

But Keaton had. Edie Finneran was his extradition advisor. She knew who he was and what he knew.

There were no drugs on that boat. It was a hit. A suicide mission to whack out the one man that could finger Keyser Soze so Sate had a few thieves put to it. Men he knew he could march into certain death.

But how - wait. You're saying SOZE sent t us to kill someone?
Verbal, he left you behind for a reason. If you all knew Soze could find you anywhere, why was he ready to send you off with the money when he could have used you to take the boat?
He wanted me to live.

Because he was my friend.
Because he was my friend.
No, Verbal. You weren't friends. Keaton didn't have friends. He saved you because he wanted it that way. It was his will.
No...
Keaton was Keyser Soze

NO.
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
THE KIND OF MAN THAT COULD HAVE KILLED EDIE FINNERAN.
Edie...
He used all of you to get him on that boat. He couldn't get on alone and he had to pull the trigger himself to make sure he got his man. The one man that could identify him.

If he's dead, Verbal - if what you say is true, then it won't matter. It was his idea to hit the Taxi Service in New York, wasn't it? Tell me the truth.
It was all Keaton. We followed him from the beginning.
I didn't know. I saw him die. I believe he's dead. Christ
Why lie about everything else, then?
Why lie about everything else, then?
You know what it's like, Agent Kujan, to know you'll never be good? Not good like you. You got good all fucked around. I mean a stand up guy. I grew up knowing I was never going to be good at anything 'cause I was a cripple. Shit, I wasn't
You're not safe on your own.
You think he's..?
You think he's..?
Is he Keyser Soze I don't know, Verbal. It seems to me that Keyser Sate is a shield. Like you said, a spook story, but I know Keaton - and someone out there is pulling strings for you. Stay here and let us protect you.

Your Honor, Bishop Brophy and the Archdiocese have offered plaintiff two hundred and ten thousand dollars.
Huh!
Huh!
My doctors didn't want a settlement at any price. They wanted this cleared up in court. They want their vindication. I agree with them. But for today the offer stands. Before we begin the publicity of a trial. For today only. When I walk out that door the offer is withdrawn. As long as you understand that. It's got to be that way.

Thank you, your Honor. We object to the copy of the admissions form as incompetemt and essentially hearsay evidence and cite McGee versus State of Indiana, U.S. 131 point 2 and 216 through 25 of the Uniform Code: 'The admission of a duplicate document in preference to an existing original must presuppose the possibility of alteration and so must be disallowed.' And, your Honor,
...one moment, Mr. Concannon...
The document is disallowed, the jury will be advised not to consider the testimony of Kathy Costello regarding the Xerox form. It's unsubstantiated and we can't accept a copy in preference to the original...
Thank you, your Honor. Further: Ms. Costello is a rebuttal witness. As a `Surprise Witness' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony. As her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form, which has been disallowed I request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here.

Because I kept a copy. I have it right here.

After, after the operation, when that poor girl, she went in a coma. Dr. Towler called me in. He told me he had five difficult deliveries in a row and he was tired, and he never looked at the admittance form. And he told me to change the form. He told me to change the one to a nine. Or else, or else, he

You guys, you guys, you're all the same. The Doctors at the hospital, you...it's 'What I'm going to do for you'; but you screw up it's `We did the best that we could. I'm dreadfully sorry...' And people like me live with your mistakes the rest of our lives.
If I could accept the offer right now, I would. They took it back.

Dr. Thompson. From your review of the hospital records of May twelfth nineteen seventy-six. In your opinion, what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye?
Cardiac arrest. During delivery her heart stopped. When the heart stops the brain's deprived of oxygen. You get brain damage. That is why she's in the state she's in today.

Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes. In your opinion is his estimate correct?

Dr. Towler; page 406, 'Contraindications to general anaesthetic. Ideally a patient should refrain from taking nourishment up to nine hours prior to induction of general anaesthetic.' Does that sound familiar?
Yes. I wrote it.

I. Yes. It is.

And you wrote that...

She threw up in her mask, yes. But she hadn't eaten one hour prior to admission.

That Frank was working on. Yeah. He thought Franky needed some help, so they bribed a juror. So Franky finds out. He comes to me in tears.

Me, too.
Me, too.
Okay. Now, so he's in jail. He, finally, he gets to see the light, he calls up Harrington, he says he thinks he made a mistake. As if by magic, charges against him are dropped, he's released from jail. P.S. He's fired from the firm, his wife divorces him, he turns to drink and mopes around three and a half years. You like that
Doctor, how long is it going to take you to pull him out of this?
It is hard to say. Six months, at least. Perhaps a year. It depends to a certain extent on him.

He won't talk.
He won't talk.
No. We have ways of digging out knowledge. But it takes longer. He is suffering from acute melancholia, together with a guilt complex. He blames himself for what happened to the woman. And we know little of the background.

How'd you get into the shipbuilding business, Gavin?
I married into it.
Interesting business.
No, to be honest, I find it dull.
No, to be honest, I find it dull.
You don't have to do it for a living.
You don't have to do it for a living.
No. But one assumes obligations. My wife's family is all gone; someone has to look after her interest. Her father's partner runs the company yard in the East -- Baltimore -- so I decided as long as I had to work at it, I'd come back here. I've always liked it here.

Almost a year.
Almost a year.
And you like it.
And you like it.
San Francisco's changed. The things a that spell San Francisco to me are disappearing fast.
Like all this.
I'd like to have lived here then. The color and excitement... the power... the freedom.
Shouldn't you be sitting down?
No, I'm all right.
No, I'm all right.
I was sorry to read about that thing in the papers. And you've quit the force. A permanent physical disability?
I was sorry to read about that thing in the papers. And you've quit the force. A permanent physical disability?
No, Acrophobia isn't a crippling thing. It just means I can't climb steep stairs or go to high places, like the bar at the Top-of-the-Mark. But -- -- there are plenty of street-level bars In this town.
Would you like a drink now?
No... no, thanks. A bit early in the day for spirits. Well, I guess that about covers everything, doesn't it? I never married; I don't see much of the "old college gang"; I'm a retired detective -- and you're in the shipbuilding business. What's on your mind, Gavin?
Not what you think. We're very happily married.
Then?
Then?
I'm afraid some harm may come to her.
I'm afraid some harm may come to her.
From whom?
From whom?
Someone dead.
Scottie, do you believe that someone out of the past, someone dead, can enter and take possession of a living being?
No.
No.
If I told you I believe that his happened to my wife, what would you say?
If I told you I believe that his happened to my wife, what would you say?
I'd say you'd better take her to the nearest psychiatrist, psychologist, neurologist, psychoanalyst, or plain family doctor. And have him check you both.

Then you're of no use to me. I'm sorry I wasted your time. Thank you for coming in, Scottie.
I didn't mean to be that rough.
No, it sounds idiotic, I know. And you're still the hard-headed Scot, aren't you? Always were. Do you think I'm making it up?
No, it sounds idiotic, I know. And you're still the hard-headed Scot, aren't you? Always were. Do you think I'm making it up?
No.
No.
I'm not making it up. I wouldn't know how. She'll be talking to me about something, nothing at all, and suddenly the words fade into silence and a cloud comes into her eyes and they go blank... and she is somewhere else, away from me... someone I don't know. I call to her and she doesn't hear. And then with a long sigh she

How often does this happen?
How often does this happen?
More and more in the past few weeks. And she wanders. God knows where she wanders. I followed her one day.
More and more in the past few weeks. And she wanders. God knows where she wanders. I followed her one day.
Where'd she go?
Watched her come out of the apartment, someone I didn't know... walking in a different way... holding her head in a way I didn't know; and get into her car, and drive out to... Golden Gate Park. Five miles. She sat on a bench at the edge of the lake and stared across the water to the old pillars that stand an the far
Well?
Well?
The speedometer of her car showed she had driven 94 miles that day. Where did she go? I have to know, Scottie. Where she goes and what she does, before I got involved with doctors.

Have you talked to the doctors at all?

I want you.

It's not my line.
It's not my line.
Scottie, I need a friend! Someone I can trust! I'm in a panic about this!
How can I see her, to know her?
We're going to an opening at the opera tonight. We'll dine at Ernie's first. Which is easier?
We're going to an opening at the opera tonight. We'll dine at Ernie's first. Which is easier?
Ernie's.
Ernie's.
All right. You won't know what to look for at first, Scottie. Even I, who know her so well, cannot tell, sometimes, when the change has begun. She looks so lovely and normal...
You've done well, Scottie. You're good at your job.
That's Carlotta Valdes.
That's Carlotta Valdes.
Yes.
Yes.
There are things you didn't tell me.

I didn't know where she was going to lead you.
I didn't know where she was going to lead you.
But you knew about this.
But you knew about this.
Oh, yes. You noticed the way she does her hair.
Something else. My wife, Madeleine, has several pieces of jewelry that belonged to Carlotta. She inherited them. Never wore them, they were too old-fashioned... until now. Now, when she is alone, she gets them out and looks at them handles them gently, curiously... puts them on and stares at herself in the mirror... and goes into that other world... is someone else again.
Carlotta Valdes was what: your wife's grandmother?
Carlotta Valdes was what: your wife's grandmother?
Great-grandmother. The child who was taken from her whose loss drove Carlotta mad and to her death - was Madeleine's grandmother.

Well, that explains it. Anyone could develop an obsession for the past, with a background like that.

Nothing.
Nothing.
And when she goes to those places...
And when she goes to those places...
She is not my wife.
How do you know all these things she doesn't know?
Her mother told me most of then before she died. I dug out the rest for myself, here.
Her mother told me most of then before she died. I dug out the rest for myself, here.
Why did she never tell her daughter?
Why did she never tell her daughter?
Natural fear. Her grandmother went insane and took her own life. And the blood is in Madeleine. Scottie, I ask you to watch her closely.
He had no right to say that. It was my responsibility. You didn't know her. I shouldn't have got you involved.
I -- I --
I -- I --
No, there's nothing you have to say to me. I'm getting out, Scottie. For good. I can't stay here. I'm winding up her affairs, and mine. I'm going to get as far away as I can. Probably Europe. And I'll probably never come back. Good-bye, Scottie. If there's anything I can do for you before I go...
Hello.
Scottie, what happened? She's not home, yet.

Hello?
Did she hurt herself?
Did she hurt herself?
No. She's in fine shape. Nothing to worry about. But she doesn't know. You understand that. She doesn't know what she did.
Could I ask you a couple of questions?

I've heard that one before, too. I remind you of someone you used to be madly in love with, but she ditched you for another guy, and you've been carrying the torch ever since, and then you saw me and something clicked. Huh!
You're not far wrong.

No, Judy, you don't understand.
No, Judy, you don't understand.
Oh, I understand, all right. I've been understanding since I was seventeen. And the next step is, as long as you're going to see me tomorrow, why don't you stay the night.

No, Judy, I'm not going to move! Please! Stay in the chair!
Why?!
Why?!
Please! And don't look at me.
Will you, Judy?
I suppose I could phone the store in the morning, and say I'm sick.
I like that one.
No, there. There's a good one. Do you like that?
No, there. There's a good one. Do you like that?
Yes --
Okay. Now we're going to buy you some clothes.
Honest?
There's Ransohoff's. Nothing but the best. Come on.
But Scottie, you don't have to!
But Scottie, you don't have to!
I want to! Come on!
But I like that one, Scottie.
No, it's not right.
Scottie, what are you doing?
I'm trying to buy you a suit.

But why?
You want me to dress like her?
Judy, I just want you to look nice. And I know what kind of suit would look well on you.
Judy, I just want you to look nice. And I know what kind of suit would look well on you.
Ah, no!!! I don't want to be dressed like someone dead!
Ah, no!!! I don't want to be dressed like someone dead!
Judy --
Judy --
It's a horrible idea! Is that what I'm here for? To make you feel that you're with someone that's dead?
Judy, it can't make much difference to you. I just want to see how you'd look and I know it won't be the same, but --
No, I don't want any clothes! I don't want anything! I want to get out of here!
No, I don't want any clothes! I don't want anything! I want to get out of here!
Judy, you've got to do this for me! Please!
I don't like it!
We'll take it! Will it fit?
I wish you'd leave me alone. I want to go away.
You can.
You can.
No, you wouldn't let me. And I don't want to go...
Judy, I want to tell you: these few days have been the first happy days I've had in a year.
I know. Because I remind you of her. The one that's dead. And not even that, very much.
I know. Because I remind you of her. The one that's dead. And not even that, very much.
No, it's you too, Judy. Something in you.
You don't even want to touch me.
Yes. Yes, I do.
The color of your hair...
Ah, no!
Ah, no!
Judy, please it can't matter to you...
The trouble is, I'm gone now. For you. And I can't do anything about it. I want you to love me. If I let you change me, will that do it? If I do what you tell me, will you love me?
Yes.
Yes.
All right. Then I'll do it. Because I don't care about me anymore. I just want you to love me.
Well?
It should be back from your face -- with a bun at the neck. I told them. I told you.
It should be back from your face -- with a bun at the neck. I told them. I told you.
We tried it. It didn't suit me.
Where shall we go for dinner?
Wherever you'd like...

Ernie's?
Ernie's?
You've got a thing about Ernie's, haven't you?

Is that the best you can do?
Come here.
Oh, no. You'll muss me.

That's what I had in mind.

Too late. I've got my face on.
I'm suddenly hungry. Would you rather go somewhere else?
No, Ernie's is fine.
No, Ernie's is fine.
I'm going to have one of those big beautiful steaks. And... let's see... to start...
I've got it. He bends down and bites the back of her neck.
Oh! You're supposed to fasten it!
Oh! You're supposed to fasten it!
All in good time.
Scottie!
How does it work?

Can't you see?

Oh, yeah. There.
We're going awfully far.
I feel like driving. Are you terrible hungry?
I feel like driving. Are you terrible hungry?
No, it's all right.
Where are you going?
To complete my cure.
Scottie, why are we here?
I told you. I have to go back into the past. Once more. For the last time.
I told you. I have to go back into the past. Once more. For the last time.
But why? Why here?
But why? Why here?
Madeleine died here.
No, I don't want to go. I want to stay here.
I need you.
I need you.
Why?
Why?
I can't do it alone. I need you, to be Madeleine for a while. Then, when it's done, we'll both be free.
I'm scared.
So am I, But it has to be done. I have to tell you about Madeleine, now.
...We stood there and I kissed her for the last time. And she said, "If lose me, you'll know that I loved you --
Scottie --
Scottie --
-- and wanted to go on loving you." And I said, "I won't lose you." But I did.
And I couldn't follow her. God knows I tried. One doesn't often get a second chance. I want to stop being haunted. You're my second chances, Judy.
Take me away...
Take me away...
You look like Madeleine, now. Go up the stairs.
You look like Madeleine, now. Go up the stairs.
No!
No!
Go up the stairs, Judy. I'll follow.
We're going up the tower, Madeleine.
No! Let me go!
No! Let me go!
We're going up the tower.
We're going up the tower.
You can't. You're afraid!
You can't. You're afraid!
I'm going to. It's my second chance.
Scottie, please...!
But you knew, that day, that I wouldn't be able to follow you didn't you. Who was at the top when you got there? Elster? With his wife?
But you knew, that day, that I wouldn't be able to follow you didn't you. Who was at the top when you got there? Elster? With his wife?
Yes!
Yes!
And she was the one who died. Not you. The real wife. You were the copy, you were the counterfeit. Was she dead or alive when you got there?
And she was the one who died. Not you. The real wife. You were the copy, you were the counterfeit. Was she dead or alive when you got there?
Dead. He'd broken her neck.
Dead. He'd broken her neck.
Took no chances, did he? And when you got there, he pushed her off the tower, was that it? But you were the one who screamed. Why did you scream?
Took no chances, did he? And when you got there, he pushed her off the tower, was that it? But you were the one who screamed. Why did you scream?
I wanted to stop it, I ran up to stop it --
I wanted to stop it, I ran up to stop it --
Why? Since you'd tricked me so well up to then?!! You played his wife so well, Judy! He made you over, didn't he? Just as I've done. But better! Not just the hair and the clothes! the look! the manner! the words! Those beautiful phony trances! That jump into the Bay! I'll bet you're really a strong swimmer, aren't you! Aren't you!!
Did he train you? Rehearse you? Teach you what to say and what to do?
Yes!
Yes!
And you were such an apt pupil! What fun you two must have had, playing games with me! Why me? Why did he pick on me?!!
And you were such an apt pupil! What fun you two must have had, playing games with me! Why me? Why did he pick on me?!!

I don't know... Switzerland?
I don't know... Switzerland?
We'll find him.
I made it.
What are you going to do?
What are you going to do?
Look at the scene of the crime. Go on in.
Oh, Judy!! When he had all her money, and the freedom and the power... he ditched you? What a shame! But he knew he was safe. You couldn't talk. Didn't he give you anything?
Some money.
Some money.
And the necklace. Carlotta's necklace. That was your mistake, Judy. One shouldn't keep souvenirs of a killing. You shouldn't have been that sentimental.
What are you going to do?
I loved you, Madeleine.
I loved you, Madeleine.
I was safe when you found me, there was nothing you could prove! But when I saw you again I couldn't run away, I loved you so! I walked into danger and let you change me again because I loved you and wanted you! Scottie, please! You love me now! Love me! Keep me safe!
Love me... keep me safe...
Too late... too late... there's no bringing her back.
Why am I here? What happened?
You... ...fell into the Bay.
You don't remember.
