Anyone know what time it is?
3:30.
Maybe it's gone.
They tend to follow moving things. Maybe it's following Polo and Timmy.
By 7:46, when the tide turns around, we'll be twenty miles out. More, with this wind.
Shut up.
Shut up.
I can't stop thinking!
The wind drift is lateral.
What's that mean?
What's that mean?
Sideways - For every yard we go this way, we also slide sideways this way....
Take a break for a minute, okay?
Huh?
Eddie, can we do that? Can we go skiing? We can use my Uncle's boat. Eddie?

I'm going.
Hurry, please.
What the hell, they can't fire both of us -- someone's got to be in charge, right? Which way are we going?
Be careful....
Anything?
Rich or poor, it's nice to have money.

I can go out if I want to.
That's fun! Let's race for some- thing!
Name it.
I don't care.
I love it.
What's wrong?
We're fighting wind and current. I though we'd be out longer, catch the incoming tide.
Faster! Faster!
Coming about....
Mike and Larry are racing! Loser goes home alone!
If we beat them, they can both go home stag! Single-O! Alone! Jackie can come back in this boat!

Maybe nobody will notice. Let's get them back in the bus.
Oh, my God....
What the hell is he doing?
You should've been out there. You should've seen him waving that gun, like a maniac. There were shots fired!
He thought he had a good reason.
Larry, I'm a businessman, trying to make a buck like anybody else.
So? So?
So? So?
So it can't be done like that. The man's a menace, plain and simple.
So it can't be done like that. The man's a menace, plain and simple.
Look, what am I supposed to do? It's done, it's over. We have to deal with the consequences.
Be reasonable, please....
Forget it, he won't listen.
We're ready for you.
I have to walk him till the drug wears off.

Go on, you're tired.

No, I'm fine, thanks.
It hasn't adjusted.
Get the hose! We've got to force more water through the gills and oxygenate him!
Don't feel bad.
Okay... Have them get it out of the tank.
Go on, Doctor.
No one's ever caught a Great White except indirectly in fishing nets. I want to dart it and keep it alive.

And Philip will be there to film it. Now that's the end of it!
I don't understand. Overman's too good a diver to disappear.
Have you checked the bars? The guy's irresponsible; he's done this before.
I'll need more men to look.
Can't help you, Mike. Don't have the manpower.

I know, but you're just going to have to find another way. So you better start.
What you're saying is we have a Great White shark in the lagoon.
And a missing man.
What's your plan, Brody?
It's easy. Put a net on the derrick. Put the net in the water by the intake passage. Turn off the intake passage. Shark comes out into the net and is hauled up.
It's Miller time!
You buying?

Sure am.
Sure am.

The grenade's just to intimidate Whitey. He knows I have it, so he watches out. Same is true when I film lions, tigers, rhinos...
I think that you and I are natural enemies.
And here I thought I was charming you.
Hello. I think his nap's over.
Get ready to go.
Get ready to go.
Believe me, I am.
Believe me, I am.
Brian, he's coming around!
Well, Doctor. You've got your shark.
Thanks to you.
Sharks have to keep moving. They can never stop or they'll suffocate. If water isn't always flowing through them, they'll die.
Is there such a place? A cave or something with such a flow?
I've heard of a White that big, in Australia...
How'd it get in here?!
He's big as a bloody bus!
The water ski show! We have to get them out!
We can assume he's back in the water intake passage.
She, Mister Hutton.
She, Mister Hutton.
He. She. Let's blow the bitch up!
A piece of pie on Sunday.
The net would have to be secured by the intake passage.
I think they'll come out now.
They still seem nervous.

He's a young one.
And big for his age.

I knew it; it's my fault. We moved it too soon.
Don't blame yourself.
Don't blame yourself.
I should have never listened to Calvin.
No one's ever done it before. It was a good try...
Not good enough.

We got it to live for ten hours. That's some kind of record.
Give me a ride?
Sure.

'Preciate it.
Musclehead?

I'm Neo-Senephrened out. Think I'm catching a cold.

Yeah, from Boston.

Goes back to when I was a kid. Mike's okay, he's gotten over his fears, but I haven't. I can't even drink it.
Well, I needed a cold shower.
Come on! Check this out!
This is where to be. High and dry.
And alone.
You were great out there!
Did you see me?! Wasn't I terrific?
Did you see me?! Wasn't I terrific?
As always.
Herpes?
Why you sonuvabitch...
Sean, do you have herpes?

Calvin said it was all right.
Calvin said it was all right.
Yeah, well I didn't!
Yeah, well I didn't!
Well, we're not going to hurt it, old boy. I say, love, is Flipper ready to go?
Make sure you put this back.
Aww, can't I keep it?
You set that thing off down there, you don't know what will happen.
Precisely.
Watch it, Brody. You're ruining the shot.
Kind of dull in there for you, isn't it? Why don't you throw in another shark?
Your friend Overman picked a hell of a time to come back.
Yeah, poor bastard.
Yeah, poor bastard.

I'll remember that, my Lordship.
Actually, thirty-five is probably more accurate.
That's impossible. If it's that big, why hasn't anybody seen it? Huh? Tell me that. It's like not seeing the Goodyear blimp in a swimming pool.
Filter system number four. Is it large enough?
It's large enough...
How far away is filter number four?
Five hundred yards.
Five hundred yards.
You have a man near it?

Okay, okay... We'll get someone on it.
Let us know as soon as you have anything.
Right, Mike.

Come on, let's go.
Something wrong?

You know Overman?
Okay, you two, have a good life without me. I gotta go.
Don't hurry back.
Mike, this is fantastic. I mean, you're responsible for building all this. What a job you've done! Maybe I'll quit school and come down here and work with you. Brody Brothers Construction. We've always wanted to do that together. Boat building.
It's not that easy. Worked construction every summer to get through school. Three years apprentice in the park's engineering department, and two years to build all this. Finish school first, Sean. Then make up your mind. If you still want to work with me, we'll have plenty of time.

She still talking to you?

What's it cost to take a ride on that plane...?
The water's coming in...The water's coming in....
I almost forgot....

You're not a pain in the ass....
You're not a pain in the ass....
Will you let me finish. I've been working on this all day.
It's not easy. None of it is. I have to find some way to get on with my life and I'm going to try. I finally figured that out. I'm going to do my best....

I don't want to talk about that.

It's a terrible thing to know some- thing no one else wants to believe.
It's a terrible thing to know some- thing no one else wants to believe.
I'm tired of hearing about it. There's no shark. Sean wasn't killed by the same shark.. Dad didn't die because of it...It's all wrong... Some fantasy you've concocted...You keep bringing it up.
You hungry?
No.
It got him....
Why'd you come out here?
Why'd you come out here?
Why'd you take the boat?
I want you all to come to Amity this summer.
There's a lot...I want to talk about it....
Promise me you'll be all right....
Promise me....
Promise me....
I'll wear my rubbers...I'll be careful ...I'll be....
We will...We'll have a lot of time together, Michael....
I'm going to finish what Jake and I started. I owe him that. Hell, I owe him everything.... I'll get something important done for both of us....
No....
First time for everything is the best. After that you know too much and it's never quite the same.

You must get bored easily.
Can you just go off...?
I'm the captain of this majestic ship. It goes where I take it....
Flies the plane....
Mostly it feels like driving. You digging for buried treasure?
I don't know why I've told you all this. I hardly know you.
Sometimes talking to a stranger is easier....

When it killed Sean it was like a stab in the heart. I knew with absolute certainty that it had come for him. I knew that. I know it's coming....
Depends on where you want to go....
Doesn't matter....
How can you just take the plane like this?
Boss' day off...Take the wheel....

If you don't take it, we'll be swimming in a minute.
It's just like driving a car....
Where do I pull off...?

You're doing fine. I'll keep you out of trouble. Relax....

You'll be sorry.
I have two right feet.
Good. I have two left....
Our little island seems to agree with you....
I have my own little island.

But it gets cold in winter....
I tried winter once. Burlington, Vermont. Flew a run to New York. I have a bone in my foot that still hasn't thawed. When I was a small boy....
That's hard to imagine....

I dreamed about always being warm... Stay a while....
I could take some time off....
You're always taking time off....

Yes you can....
They had them on the big one....
I have coffee in the thermos.

How come it bumps up and down when there's no road?

The wind does that. Ever been to the Bahamas before?
Want to go for a little ride?
I do....
I don't know why I fish here...Never catch anything...Must be a sign under the water...'Beware, Hoagie's here....'
You're the man who drives the plane.
You the architect?
I'm the artist. Like my mother.
Hurry!
Just like that?
Can you keep a secret? Something no one else knows?
Yes I can....
Yes I can....
I own the airplane. I can do whatever I want. I'm the boss.
It was theirs anyway. I 11 buy us all a drink....
We'll buy you one. We're having a party....
I hope she's a good sailor....
A shark attacked Thea and some kids...She's going after it....
You're going after her in that? You're crazy...It'll take all day in that bathtub....
You got a better idea...?
When we find her we'll radio her position...The Coast Guard will pick her up. Don't worry....
She'll be all right, partner.. She'll never find it. We couldn't....
What do you mean, it'll find her?
She said it was coming....
Grab your socks....
You sure you know how to do this.
You sure you know how to do this.
Hell, no. What kind of pilot do you think I am...?
Hell, that wasn't half bad.. Get going...I'll keep it busy....
It'll come for the plane. It's attracted to metal. The electro- magnetic impulse....

Will you get the bloody hell out of here....
What say we get the hell out of here, Ellen Brody. ...
Get her started....
Maybe the plane gave it indigestion....
They spend half their lives looking for food and the other half eating it They don't care what it is....
Keep it steady....
Aye, aye, Captain....
Jake tells me you're going to have to fly for the rest of your life to pay off what you lost at the crap table....
Good news travels fast....
Mind if I cut in? Your date's lonely....
The world would be a better place if more sons danced with their mothers.
I want you to leave her alone. I don't want you involving her in....
What's that....?
What do you deliver on all those charters you...?
I fly elephants for smugglers....
Can't this thing go any faster?
Any faster and it'll turn into a flying Cuisinart and dice us into oblivion....
Come on, Hoagie....
All you passengers are the same.... Complain...Complain....
What happened?
Nothing! What the hell are you doing down there?
The damn thing is going to have our asses....
It needs more time to charge.
Matt?

You guys are making this into some- thing that just isn't so... It's just a shark. A great big bloody wonderful shark. Don't say anything to anyone. The locals find out they'll panic. They'll want to kill it. We've got us a great white, Michael. We're going to do us some real research....

It's a method for quitting smoking.
It's a technique I read about. If you smoke 60 a day, you buy three packs, throw one cigar- ette away, and smoke 59. Day 2, you throw 2 away and smoke 58 ..
Why don't you throw them all away, and smoke none?

That isn't what you said before.
I was wrong.
You believe me, don't you?

He didn't shoot it, Ross. And no way by accident. There's a flash-burn. It was point-blank.
Why's she blind, Bro?
Car accident.
God, it pisses me off, Ross.
No God, Brother. If there was a God, asses wouldn't be at the perfect height for kicking.

Alright. I'll start at the top, and work down.

Why did he ask if it was frozen?
That, I couldn't tell you .. And don't worry about anya this crap, by the time you're back it's gone ..
What is that?
Laser enhancement of the finger- tip .. it's really bothering me .. See these striations right here? It's like she's always worrying the end of her finger? Rubbing it with a thumb nail, or something?
How do you know her hair's black?
Hair on her hand. Plus Jen- nifer had raven black hair.

Yeah, that's all very inter- esting, but where's the body?

You're pushing this too hard. It's like you <u>want</u> me to say <u>stop</u>? You must know that's the way this is going, John? There's other work to do, why don't ya ease off a little?

You just asked me to ask you questions.
You just asked me to ask you questions.
I know, but you pick on the one time in my life I like not to remember. I was in the bad lands. Really not well. It's something that happens to a lota cops. We don't wanna talk about that.

No, I don't pray .. Had a dream once, about God, just around the time I was getting well .. He was a nasty lookin little guy, moved into the apartment right on topa me .. I said, don't you listen to people's prayers? He said, prayers? Not often. They're Junk Mail.
Sorry?

You're looking worried again, Helena?

She has an aunt, in Vermont. I'll take her there tonight.
I'm going back to the institute.
I'm going back to the institute.
No .. not now ..
Don't say that. Don't you <u>dare</u> say that .. <u>I believe you</u> ..
I know you're trying to help me, but you don't understand.
I know you're trying to help me, but you don't understand.
<u>Then explain it to me</u>. I got enough darkness, don't I?
The man who killed Amber is a psychopath. He was up at the in- stitute to <u>kill you</u> - he don't wanna kill Rose - he was there to <u>kill you</u> - that's the truth - and I didn't wanna tell it to you - but that's the reason I want you to stay at Margie's - coz I can't protect you here ..
Why does he want to kill me?

Coz he thinks you're a witness.

I can't identify him ..

I'm blind because my father drank.
You don't wanna sit here any more, sweetheart ..
I wanna be near you ...
I think they're gonna arrest me.
I don't want them to arrest you.
I don't want them to arrest you.
It's not as bad as it sounds .. They can't refuse me bail. Raise bail of my own cognizance & find the best damned lawyer there is ..
What are you doing, Travis?
I been told to take your car in, Sir.

Why?
Why?
I dunno, Sir. Brought you up a Chevy.
You got a warrant for this?

The man from the F.B.I.
Interview over, Blattis ...
C'mon, Chief, if it's sensitive, tell me .. I'm not taking notes ..

Grateful for your candor, Sir.

Then do me a favor, and keep this outta the newspaper - that dump serves a dozen different communities, we don't even know if it's ours? Till we do I don't want no one worrying about ..

Wasn't frozen, was it, Sergeant?
Come on, Michael, outta here, the guys trying to move in. I told you what we know, something else, you- 'll be the first to hear about it ..
A blind girl can just walk out of here, and you don't know who with?
You find something curious in that?
You find something curious in that?
Yeah, I guess I do.
Yeah, I guess I do.
Then let me put your mind at ease .. Firstly, Amber isn't "blind" - she has some useful vision - and second, this isn't a prison, it's a college of higher education - a severe vis- ual disability doesn't mean my stud- ents don't value their independence as much as anybody else - and Amber was a very independent young woman - She decided

And you got <u>no</u> <u>idea</u> with who?
And you got <u>no</u> <u>idea</u> with who?
No, Sergeant, I got <u>no</u> <u>idea</u> with who. And I might add, that in another six weeks, a hundred and fifty students will be leaving here, & driving away for their Christmas holidays with pe- ople whose name I-won't-know-either ..
When did John divorce?
Two or three years ago.
Two or three years ago.
What was she like?
What was she like?
Suzanne? Very pretty. She was a semi- professional model. But a policeman's wife she wasn't. So one day, she just packed it and left. And his whole life went straight down the nearest toilet.

What does that mean?
What does that mean?
You know, he crashed. He just couldn't come to terms with it .. John hates to lose, and he hated losing her .. Every spare minute, he's driving down to San Diego, having a terrible time with her, getting drunk, and driving back .. you just don't believe the amount he drank ..
You think he still loves her?
Think he still thinks about her. But not like then. Then was an obsession.
I haven't worn heels since I was 16. I don't think I could walk in these?
Sure you can. Anyway, parties are all about standing still ..
You think John would like it?
I think John, would <u>love</u> it ...
How you doing on those shoes?
Don't mix very well with beer.
Is that Margie?
I'm here, honey. I'm right here.
I'm not giving him <u>Pizza</u>. I haven't seem him for a year? I'm gonna cook him a dinner.
Dinner's another night, darlin .. This is a drive-by. I got an hour ..
Bobby's out .. What's the hurry?
Friday night at City Hall. Got a great chance to frighten the fat.

Freddy's new obsession ..
So tonight she confesses?
Tonight I'm feeling lucky ..
No it isn't .. It's Californian ..
Even better.
Such a shame .. She's a really sweet kid ..
She's a doll. But I wish he hadn't brought her out here.
He's happy, darlin ..
I'm sure he is. But gettin in- to the "element" is a bad idea.
Except for the hair color, she looks just like Suzanne?
Well, that's who she is. Cept she can't run away.
You want something, darling?
I wouldn't mind another B.E.E.R.
She married some English prick.
He's not that bad of a guy ..?
He's not that bad of a guy ..?
Got a handshake like a partially excited penis.
Hey, we're not talking "talk" tonight.
No one's gonna make that Gent. Six months investigation, & the nearest we got, we thought he was a sailor.
Just easy on the words you're putting in my face, Sergeant ..
Whass going on here?
You think you're the only guy ever worked a homicide? I was a big-city cop too. And I bust- ed the clock on fucken Jennifer. I know more about this man than you'll over know - and that's how I know it ain't him - you- 're investigating a soap-opera ..
Alright, guys. We stop this <u>now</u>.
Alright, guys. We stop this <u>now</u>.
He tells her, "bye-bye," and she gets "attacked." Well, give me a fucking break! There <u>is</u> no "Ser- ial Killer." Stick her name up in neon, there's still no Serial kil- ler! And I ain't the only one say- ing it. Everyone in this building is saying it. And I mean <u>everyone</u>.
Shut up, King Jay ..
No, c'mon, Freddy, let's have this out & over. You know what everyone thinks? They think you're making a case coz you found yourself a nice piece of ass. And no one's blaming you for it, I hear she's worth the flowers. But don't come in here get- ting holy over us. Sure I put it in the paper. Coz I wanted to <u>stop</u>
You can drive down there, Sir ..
I'm already walking. Where is it?
On the infill. The guy from L.A.'s just gone down there ..
He has? .. What's he doing here?
He has? .. What's he doing here?
He was waiting for you, Sir. Wait- ed a good while. Said he'd go down and take a look. I hope that's O.K.
Damn A, it's O.K. With a bit of luck I'm goin home. What we got?
A derelict.
Where do you fit in, Trimble?
His father's the manager, Sir. The kid was up there shooting vermin, and he found the body.
I wonder what would make him do a thing like that?
Don't annoy me, Travis.
Don't annoy me, Travis.
No, Sir.
I think I found some- thing horrible, Sir
Whatta you mean, "horrible?"
Whatta you mean, "horrible?"
I think I've found a hand.
The coroner wants to know if we can release the derelict?
Ask him.
Don't ever stop fucking me!
Sooner... or later... I'll have to stop.
Sooner... or later... I'll have to stop.
Oh Gawd, oh yes, it's never been better. Never BETTER!!
You know. I don't think we need to do the thing where we tell each other everything!
Jerry, this is what intimacy is!
Oh -- don't forget tomorrow we have dinner with Wade Cooksey.
I know about the bachelor party.
Who told you?
One of the accountants.
The power move is to go unannounced. Black suit, right?
And the egyptian cotton shirt that works with or without the jacket. Tell me again, how was it left with Cush?

Ugh!
Ugh!
Seventy-two clients. ONE stayed. Jacket on, tie in pocket. _ 44.
Good. They're all heatseekers! All of them, everybody. You keep one superstar and they'll all follow. There's no real loyalty, and the first person who told me that, Jerry Maguire, was you.
I think I was trying to sleep with you at the time.

Well, it worked, and I will not let you fail. You are Jerry Ma- fuckin-guire.

Okay, this is working.

You are not a loser.
Who said anything about "loser?" Where do you get this word "loser?"
I'm sorry. I was on a roll. I meant something else. When do you want to leave?
Now.
Let's go. I'll drive you. _ 45.

It's a plan -- -- _ 51.
This can't be happening to me.
Jerry! Do something --
I just heard.
What do I do? How do I spin this?
What do I do? How do I spin this?
Oh honey. It's spun.
It's all about you, isn't it? Soothe me, save me, love me --
Could you just stop moving?
Could you just stop moving?
I have to finish my job --
I have to finish my job --
Everything's on the fucking run! Everything --
Jerry. You and I are salespeople. We sell --
Look, I don't want a --
Look, I don't want a --
It's not "love me." It's not "trust my handshake." It's make the sale. Get it signed. There shouldn't be "confusion" about that.
It's not "love me." It's not "trust my handshake." It's make the sale. Get it signed. There shouldn't be "confusion" about that.
Go ahead. Jump right on into my nightmare. The water's warm. _ 65.
Tell you what -- I'd prefer loyalty..
What was our deal when we first got together? Brutal truth, remember?
What was our deal when we first got together? Brutal truth, remember?
I think you added the "brutal."
Don't say it. We're both ragged out right now.

Listen to me!
No.
No.
It's over --
Didn't hear it.
There is something missing here.

You've never been alone and you can't be alone --
You've never been alone and you can't be alone --
Listen to me, it's over.
No one has ever dumped me.
I'm not trying to make history. _ 67.
I did the 23 hour nose-route to the top of El Capitan in 6 hours! I can make this work.
No.
Oh Jerry.
You know I didn't ever want to hurt you.
Wait. Did I just say "hon" to him?
Yeah, Dotty. You did. _ 50.
Don't let him stay up too late.
Hey, man, tonight I'm going to teach Ray about jazz.
Hey, man, tonight I'm going to teach Ray about jazz.
Good, that'll put him to sleep early. No offense.
He's asleep, right?
Yeah, how'd it go with Sportboy?
Yeah, how'd it go with Sportboy?
Still going.
Let me think about that. Want something to drink?
I see what you're saying.
I see what you're saying.
Wait. What do you mean?
Cush, Matt -- we have a decision to make.
"It's okay to eat fish, 'cause they Don't have any feelings...

"Something in the way. Yeah."
Reporters, Jerry. They been callin' all night.
Just be friendly and say "no comment."
Just be friendly and say "no comment."
Talking and saying nothing, man, it's an art I have not mastered.
You hear those courtesy laughs, Jerry? There is a seething wrongness at the edges of this party.
Oh come on --
Oh come on --
This is fuckin Michael Jordan, man! They should be screaming.
This is fuckin Michael Jordan, man! They should be screaming.
You're imagining it.
... this is... uh... too funny...
They ain't laughing, man. Something's wrong.
Look, Rod, just get on the camel!
Bill, Rod, wait --
Airight. Enough. I'm pulling him out of this. This isn't what I had in mind anyway.
Then you shouldn't have begged me to hire him.
No no...
Oh, tell the story.
Can I help?
Oh. Hi. I work in your office. I was on the junket to the conference. I'm --
Oh. Hi. I work in your office. I was on the junket to the conference. I'm --

My son... my mind...
Well, thanks.
Well, take care.
Well, take care.
And have fun at your bachelor party.
Oh no.
No no. I knew.
No no. I knew.
Nnnnn. I just killed the surprise.
Nnnnn. I just killed the surprise.
No, I'm just... anxiously looking past it. I already had my bachelor party. It was called "my twenties." See you later.
I think in this age, optimism like that... it's a revolutionary act.
You think so?
You think so?
Oh tsht. Yes.
Oh tsht. Yes.
I appreciate that, because some of that stuff... you know, it was two in the morning and...
I appreciate that, because some of that stuff... you know, it was two in the morning and...
-- the part about "we should embrace what it is still virginal about our enthusiasm" --
Oh no. I'm sure it would just make your day to drive us all the way to Manhattan Beach, taking that left down to little tiny Waterloo street where you have to play chicken with oncoming traffic, and your life flashes before your eyes, but -- hey, I've obviously had too much coffee and all -- here's my sister Laurel to pick us up.
Dorothy. Ray. A pleasure.
Wonder what he said.
My favorite aunt is hearing impaired. He said "you complete me." _ 40.
So I know this is a bad time, but -- you will have a medical program, right?
Sure. Yes. Medical, I don't know.
And I guess we didn't talk about money. So, I'll just dive in --
Give me your number. I'll call tomorrow. I'm just a little. I'm a little insane right now. But it's going to be great.
Give me your number. I'll call tomorrow. I'm just a little. I'm a little insane right now. But it's going to be great.
No no, I know --
But I mean really... wonderfully... great.
Absolutely.
That took guts.
Same to you.
Honey -- later, okay? Whoop. Wait.
Hello?
Hello?
Sorry, that's my son and the nanny. I had the calls transferred to my home so I could go over your stuff.
No, that's fine. What calls came in today?
Wait. That's yesterday, from the other office. Today is...
... light.
Shit, it's just so frustrating to not be able to talk to Avery --
Dorothy, let me tell you something, we are back. We are so very very back. I re-signed Cush. We're set.
We are?
We are?
It's all going to work.
It's all going to work.
I just got goosebumps.
It's all going to work. We're going to save the world.
Well, I'm happy for you.
Well, I'm happy for you.
Happy for us.
Happy for us... okay. Here's the number. 404-453-2222.
Thanks.
Thanks.
Call me later, hon.
Okay, have we gone over everything? Back on Tuesday, right?
Yep. Have a good time at school, Ray. Wish me luck.
Hey you.
Hi.
Thanks for inviting me over. Where's the little guy?
He's asleep. Watch out for that lamp.
He's asleep. Watch out for that lamp.
I'm glad you're home. That "alone" thing is... not my specialty...
Oh my God.
Yeah. That too. I broke up with Avery.
Too bad.
Better now than later. We'll still be friends. I'm dying here.
Better now than later. We'll still be friends. I'm dying here.
Jesus, it's a real gash, isn't it?
Jesus, it's a real gash, isn't it?
And just think if I got her the ring she really wanted.
Sorry. Uh, let me see, have a seat. I'll get you some aloe vera for that cut too.
Do you have something to drink?
Do you have something to drink?
Sure --
Beer okay?
Yeah, thanks.
Drinks. Food. Plus, I called you a cab.
Good idea. Thank you.
Don't worry about me. I can get jobs --
We will be fine!
We will be fine!
-- especially one like this.
-- especially one like this.
And I am...
Truth?
Sure.
Me too.
What you wrote inspired me. _ 79.
I'm working with you because of that memo...
Mission... statement...
Well.
Sorry about this hand. You know that feeling -- you're not completely embarrassed yet, but you glimpe tomorrow's embarrassment?
Sorry about this hand. You know that feeling -- you're not completely embarrassed yet, but you glimpe tomorrow's embarrassment?
Don't worry about it, boss.
Don't worry about it, boss.
Oh shit. You said "boss."
Oh shit. You said "boss."
Yeah, I did.
Yeah, I did.
Now I feel like Clarence Thomas.
Now I feel like Clarence Thomas.
No. No don't feel like Clarence Thomas.
No. No don't feel like Clarence Thomas.
No, I do. I feel like Clarence Thomas. I'm like... harrassing you... right now.
No, I do. I feel like Clarence Thomas. I'm like... harrassing you... right now.
I may not sue.
Well, good evening.
Good evening.
Dennis Wilburn called from Arizona to say he's faxing in the new Tidwell offer on Thursday morning, and you'll be happy.
Happy. He said "happy?"
Happy. He said "happy?"
Actually he said "glad." _ 85.
Good. Good. Glad is good.
Plus, you could use that commission.
I sunk most of what I had into this condo, which devalued, and --
You don't have to explain.
You don't have to explain.
Look, the other night, I want to apologize.
Look, the other night, I want to apologize.
Yeah, what happened there.
Yeah, what happened there.
We're two people working together and we can't have an atmosphere.
We're two people working together and we can't have an atmosphere.
I'm relieved you said that.
I'm relieved you said that.
I mean, the other night was... I felt like you understood something I could barely even say, something way down deep in the murk -- -- but we have a company here to think about. I won't ever take advantage of you in that way again.

Oh good.
Oh good.
You walked out on a job for me, and I won't ruin that.
You walked out on a job for me, and I won't ruin that.
Exactly because I know this is a time when you need to be alone with your thoughts. _ 86.
Wow. That's more than a dress. That's an Audrey Hepburn movie.
Yeah -- guess I got revved up at the idea of an evening among adults -- no offense buster. You meet Chad the nanny?
Yeah -- guess I got revved up at the idea of an evening among adults -- no offense buster. You meet Chad the nanny?
Yeah, I did -- am I dressed okay? I guess I didn't realize we were...
We'll see you soon, honey. Bye.
Bye you guys. _ 88.
It was laziness1 my whole breakup with Avery. You know that thing you say, "it's nobody's fault." It's one of the great lies, right? Someone is always to blame -- if you go for it, go for it like you do a job, work at it --
Maybe love shouldn't be such hard work. I know, but --
Maybe you should call her.
No no no. I just underestimated her... her temper, I guess. Why are we even talking about this?
Yeah. It wasn't like my marriage to Roger was so great, even before -- Jerry?
What?
What?
Let's not tell our sad stories.
Well -- this would be goodnight.
Good night.
I think you should not come in, or come in depending on how you feel.
Same to you.
Same to you.
No. I have to go in. I live here.
No. I have to go in. I live here.
Right. I'll come in.
Right. I'll come in.
Okay. Wait here a second. Do we really want to do this?
Okay. Wait here a second. Do we really want to do this?
Oh hell yes.
Oh God.
Easy, easy --
Another time, okay Dorothy?
Fine, I just --
Fine, I just --
And I appreciate that impulse.
Sure you're okay to drive this?
This rig? Phht. No problem.
This rig? Phht. No problem.
So I'll see you this weekend.
What --
Look, just in case this weekend becomes next month and next month becomes... whatever... Don't make a joke of your life. Go back and read what you wrote. You're better than the rest of them, better than the Bob Sugars, and don't forget it.
If I said that, would you stay?
No no. Don't do that. Don't say that if you don't...
No no. Don't do that. Don't say that if you don't...
Will you marry me?
I was thinking I hope he doesn't get injured. I felt responsible.
Sometimes I can't tell at all, what's going through that head of yours.
And I really don't know your noises yet.
Well, when you wonder, ask me.
Well, when you wonder, ask me.
Okay... I will...
Why do you love me?
Why do you love me?
It's my fault.
What --

It's not fair to you. This whole --

I took advantage of you and worst of all, I'm not alone. I did this with a kid. I was just on some ride where I thought I was in 1ove enough for both of us. I did this. And at least I can do something about it now.

Why fucking not! I deserve it.

What if it's true? "Great at friendship bad at intimacy." I mean, come on. It's the theme of my bachelor film --

Oh please. My need to make the best of things, and your need to be what, "responsible"... if one of us doesn't say something now we might lose ten years being polite about it. Why don't we call this next road trip what it is. A nice long break.

What about Ray?
There's no question you'll be friends. Of course you'll be friends.
So this break... is a break-up.
So this break... is a break-up.
Come on, Jerry. You know this isn't easy for me. _ 118.
This used to be my specialty. I was good in a living room. Send me in there, I'll do it alone. And now I just... I don't know... but on what was supposed to be the happiest night of my business life, it wasn't complete, wasn't nearly close to being in the same vicinity as complete, because I couldn't share it with you. I
Aw, shut up. You had me at hello. _ 130.
What about medical?
Of course, medical! _ 42.

Of course I know --
Wait. Where is he?
He's in the living room asleep.
He's coming over.
At eleven at night? _ 70.
He just lost his best client. He called from the plane. I invited the guy over.
Dotty -- this is not "guy.". This is a "syndrome." It's called Early Midlife, About-To-Marry, Hanging Onto The-Bottom-Rung Dear- God-Don't-Let-Me-Be-Alone, I'll- Call-My-Newly Long-suffering- Assistant-Without Medical-For- Company Syndrome. And if, knowing all that, you still allow him to come over, more power to you.

Honey, he's engaged. And for the first time in my professional life, I'm a part of something I believe in.
I heard.
No kidding. I looked over and saw the shadow of two curious shoes in the doorway of the kitchen.

Look, here's some of that chicken with salsa too, I warmed it up -- _ 74.
That's the girl I love.
But you just gotta hear me out on one thing. You're very responsible with Ray and you know it's not right for a little boy to hear some strange man's voice in the house.

As opposed to twenty angry women?
I've got a 24 hour a day reminder of Roger, for the rest of my life. I have had three lovers in four years, all boring, all achingly self-sufficient all friends of yours I might add, and all of them running a distant second to a warm bath. Look at me, Laurel, look at me. I'm the oldest 26 year old in the world!
Good.
Good.
Thanks.
Forgot your keys --
That's the first time I ever saw him kiss a man, like a dad, wasn't that just... thrilling? I mean, he must have been needing that.
No no. Don't cry at the beginning of the date.
Oh, knock it off! _ 89.
First you gotta tell me something.
No--
Because I'm worried that you're putting your faith in this guy who, because of the way things are going, may not have an emotional marble in his head.
Please, if I start talking --
Please, if I start talking --
Guys are just different people when they're hanging onto the bottom rung.
Easy, hon, I was just looking for fun details --
Oh, well, why didn't you say so? And oh, I don't know if you're interested in this detail, but I was just about to tell you that I love him. I love him, and I don't care what you think. I love him for the guy he wants to be, and I love him for the guy he almost is. I love him.
No, Roy. I'm not gonna cry.
-- well, Rod, your agent passed me a note before the show. He says that your deal memo has been signed by the Arizona Cardinals. Four years for ten-point-two million dollars. Playing in the state where you grew up.

I... I love everybody, man. I love my wife. My kids. Little Tyson. My new baby Kaydee. My brother Tee Pee. I love my friends, my teammates, who am I leaving out?
I... I love everybody, man. I love my wife. My kids. Little Tyson. My new baby Kaydee. My brother Tee Pee. I love my friends, my teammates, who am I leaving out?
It's only a half-hour show, Rod.
Oh yes. Jerry Maguire! My agent! This is a fierce, loving individual, I love this man, he is love, he is about love -- my ambassador of kwan.
Ten seconds, Rod.
Ten seconds, Rod.
And I love my fans, of which he is one. Wanna thank them for all my Sundays, and of course my Monday nights too. That about says it...
Matt, I came here because in all honesty your son is just another piece of cattle to SMI. But to me --
We decided to stay with you.
Oh, thank you.
Told myself -- if he shows up, we'll stick with him.
Told myself -- if he shows up, we'll stick with him.
You know, I'm not a hugger and yet... I can't let go.
I want him to go number one in the draft, and I want him to play.
It's either going to be Denver or San Diego trading up to take him.
Denver is where he should be.
I'll give it everything.
I'll give it everything.
You know I don't do "contracts." But'cha do have my word, and it's stronger than oak.
What happened to Denver?
Denver got very silent about a day ago. San Diego's got a fever for Cush. This stuff tends to happen the night before a draft. People get crazy. And San Diego, you should know, is crazy to the tune of seven years for thirty. Signing bonus of eight. Million.
Not right now, Jerry.
Do I know everything there is to know here? You fellas aren't talking with Bob Sugar, are you?
Apparently, Denver wanted to deal with him instead of you.
Said who? Sugar?
Said who? Sugar?
Hey, I'm learning as I go.
Hey, I'm learning as I go.
So you empowered Bob Sugar to deal with Denver behind my back?
So you empowered Bob Sugar to deal with Denver behind my back?
I'm sorry, I --
I'm sorry, I --
I brought Denver to twenty million. Denver deals with me all the time. You listened to Sugar? You let that snake in the door.
Now. Wait. You didn't actually sign with Sugar, did you? Tell me you didn't sign. Because I'm still sort of moved by your "my word is stronger'n oak" thing --
We signed an hour ago. You were in the lobby with the black fella.
Alright, we're just getting started on my list of things you need to know. Take notes if you want to.
Okay.
Good, 'cause see, I am a valuable commodity. I go across the middle. I see the ball and a dude coming right at me, wanting to kill me, I tell my brain "get killed, catch the ball." That's New York Steak, baby. Rare. And yet, nobody's giving me LOVE. Nobody's giving me PROPS. Nobody. I went to Arizona State, I'm from Arizona, I break
Now you want Arizona dollars.
Now you want Arizona dollars.
Exactly. And I'm sitting here with an ant problem, look! And my brother Tee Pee's room is flooded with water. Say hello to Jerry Maguire --
-- now to recap, I want to stay in Arizona, I want my new contract, I like you, you're nice to my wife, I will stay with you, that's what I'm doing for you, but here's what you're gonna do for me. You listening?
Mmm. Hmm.
Mmm. Hmm.
It's a very personal, very important thing. It's a family motto. So I want to share it with you. You ready?
It's a very personal, very important thing. It's a family motto. So I want to share it with you. You ready?
Yes.
Yes.
Here it is. "Show me the money." Show. Me. The. Money. _ 36.
I got it.
Now doesn't that just make you feel good to say it? Say it with me.
Show. Me. The. Money.
Congratulations. You're still my agent.
At last I find you.
Why the fuck am I here? I feel like I'm five years late for the Prom.
I came all the way here for that? To walk the lobby?
Yeah. And it might have even worked too.
Yeah. And it might have even worked too.
Let's do it again.
You believe they're shooting a Nike ad down there? Did I ever tell you my Nike story?
I gotta get back to Cushman.
I gotta get back to Cushman.
Okay, I understand. I'll boil it down for ya. Fuck Nike. All they do is ignore me...
You're loving me now, aren't ya?
I'm not about love -- I'm about "showing you the money."
Good. I was just testing ya. But just you saying that? Makes me love ya.
Get some sleep. See you tomorrow.
Get some sleep. See you tomorrow.
Sure you don't want to go out and find some karoake? I'm a very good singer, man --
Sure you don't want to go out and find some karoake? I'm a very good singer, man --
Call me tomorrow.

I might call you later!
You love me now, don't you?

Rod --
You feel bad you tested positive? Quit doing blow! You feel bad about your baby girl? Why did you leave the mother?
You feel bad you tested positive? Quit doing blow! You feel bad about your baby girl? Why did you leave the mother?
What are you doing with me, Rod?
What are you doing with me, Rod?
Huh?
Huh?
Don't you even see -- I'm finished. I'm fucked. Twenty-four hours ago, I was hot. Now... I'm a cautionary tale!
See this jacket I'm wearing? You like it? I don't really need it, because I'm CLOAKED IN FAILURE. I lost the number one draft pick the night before the draft. They will teach my story to other agents on "do not do this" day in agent school. Why? Let's recap. Because a hockey player's kid made me feel like a superficial jerk, I had
Well, boo-fucking-hoo.
Well, boo-fucking-hoo.
The least you could do is nod and act sympathetic --
The least you could do is nod and act sympathetic --
No.
No.
It's a quality that might come in handy for a commercial sometime. _ 69.
You are not allowed to act this way.
Why not?
Man, I got a shelf life of ten years, tops! My next contract's gotta bring me the dollars that'11 last me and mine a very long time. I'm out of this sport in five years. What's my family gonna live on? What you get me. So I don't want to hear about ya shit, your "nya nya nya."
Another drink please.
Another drink please.
Anybody else would have left you by now, but I'm sticking with you. I said I would. And if I got to ride your ass like Zorro, you're gonna show me the money.

Did you tell him about the "ten million for four years?"
Uh, not today, but --
Uh, not today, but --
John Taylor. J.J. Stokes. Andre Rison. I SMOKE all these fools, and yet they're making the big sweet dollars. They're making the money, and I got an agent that ain't even put the number on the table.

I understand your anxiety.
I understand your anxiety.
Maybe you don't. Because it's not just the money I deserve. It's not just the "coin." It's the...
-- the kwan.
That's your word?
That's your word?
Yeah, man, it means love, respect, community... and the dollars too. The package. The kwan.
Yeah, man, it means love, respect, community... and the dollars too. The package. The kwan.
But how did you get "kwan?" _ 82.
I got there from "coin," dude. Coin, coin... kwaaaan.
Great word. Towel?
Great word. Towel?
No, I air-dry.
No, I air-dry.
Rod, I say this with great respect, but those players you mentioned are marquee players and --
Is that your porty or mine?
You.
You're telling me to dance.
No, I'm saying to be --
"Love me love me love me... put me on t.v." That's the iconography of rascism, man!
Rod, I'm not a rascist. I'm telling you to be the best version of you, to get back to the guy who first started playing this game. Way back when you were a kid. It wasn't just about the money, was it?
Do your job, man, don't tell me to dance.
Fine.
What's wrong.
Forget it. Forget it.
Forget it. Forget it.
No tell me. _ 84.
I'm out here for you! You don't know what it's like to be me out here for you. It is an up-at-dawn pride-swallowing seige that I will never fully tell you about! Okay?! Help me help you help me help you.
You're hanging by a very thin thread, dude. And I dig that about you.
If you get injured, you get nothing.
Won't happen. I'm strong in my mind.
Won't happen. I'm strong in my mind.
It's a risk.
I'll get you some quick work --
Good deal, man.
Dude, know your art form. If you put the camera down here, looking up, I look more powerful. There's no need for a camel... you got ME.
Rod, get on the camel.
Can I ask you a question totally unrelated to your career?
Oh, we gonna be friends now?
Oh, we gonna be friends now?
What do you know about dating a single mother?
Oh I know plenty. I was raised by a single mother.
Tell me, because it's been a month, and she's about to take another job in San Diego.
First, single mothers don't "date." They have been to the circus, you know what I'm saying? They have been to the puppet show and they have seen the strings. You love her?
How do I know?
How do I know?
You know when you know. It makes you shivver, it eats at your insides. You know?
You know when you know. It makes you shivver, it eats at your insides. You know?
No, I don't know.
No, I don't know.
Then you gotta have The Talk.
Then you gotta have The Talk.
But I sure don't like that she's leaving.
But I sure don't like that she's leaving.
Well, that ain't fair to her. A single mother, that's a sacred thing, man. _ 103.
The kid is amazing.
No. A real man does not shoplift the "pooty" from a single mom.
No. A real man does not shoplift the "pooty" from a single mom.
I didn't "shoplift the pooty." We were thrown together and -- I mean it's two mutual people who -- Alright, I shoplifted the pooty.

Shame on you. SHAME on you.
You never had The Talk, did you?
No.
No.
Well, this was another way to go.
Tidwell moves to a tan in a wheelchair, signs an autograph and moves on. Jerry alongside. The quarterback sucks, man. He's gonna get me killed.
I'm a little worried --
I'm a little worried --
I'm worried too. I'm worried that the only reason I'm here getting my brains blown loose is that you weren't asshole enough to get my ten million three months ago.
We can still take the offer, Rod.
No.
Well, just stay healthy. I will show you the kwan.
Hey, that's my word, okay?
I'm gonna have the game of my life on Monday Night Football, and show all these motherfuckers.
Take care, okay? You're my entire client roster.
Take care, okay? You're my entire client roster.
Don't I know. Now go home to your wife.

Why are you even here, man? You could have told me all this over the phone.

I'm asking you a question --

Not everyone has what you have.
Then why'd you get married? I'm asking you as a friend.
Then why'd you get married? I'm asking you as a friend.
You're jabbing at me. _ 112.
I'm sorry I asked.
No, I'm going to answer you. You want an answer? I'll give it to you. Loyalty. She was loyal. Everything grew from there.
No, I'm going to answer you. You want an answer? I'll give it to you. Loyalty. She was loyal. Everything grew from there.

Airight. Here's why you don't have your ten million dollars yet. You are a paycheck player. You play with your head. Not your heart. In your personal life? Heart. But when you get on the field -- _ 113.
I don't want to be friends anymore.
Fine.

And I can't say his name without laughing I want to eat him up. I want to say goodbye to every bad thought I ever had about relationships. I mean, I crave this guy... and yet... why... why did I have that affair this weekend? Does that mean I'm not in love with my boyfriend?
I think you'll know when you see him at the gate.
I think you'll know when you see him at the gate.
It's the death rattle of my singlehood, right? Because I finally see the white picket fence looming and I love it/hate it/love it/hate it/ love it... you're right, I'll know when I see him. Why is it so easy to talk with you?! Tell me about your fiancee.
I uh... don't think we're quite at your pitch yet.
Tell me, and then you can sleep.
Tell me, and then you can sleep.
She's an NFL publicist... amazing sense of style... former athlete... volleyball... world class... really knows how to live every moment of her life, which is why I should take a nap now...
Oh, tell the story.

To the pools. Now she's Miss Rock Climber, and I'm more the Non-Rock Climber, but we're hiking up through the pools and there's a fine mist in the air, and I have the ring in my pocket, and I'm a little nervous, I'm lagging behind, and she says to me, get this -- "Hurry up, klutz."

Oh no -- _ 14.
Well, it bothered me somewhat. And I got quiet. And now she's quiet and we're both pouting a little, you know. And I decide I'm not going to propose. The mood is not right. Why be impulsive? Now at this point I know she knows that I was going to propose and didn't. And she knows I know. So the entire sixty mile ride
How sad --
How sad --
But wait...
Which they do. And we're standing there. All the football guys are in the lobby, watching, there's even an ESPN crew. So I turn to her and sort of grandly say, "Well, this is me, Klutz, asking you, Goddess of Rock Climbing, to marry me." And I took out the ring, and I don't much like big scenes, but she said "yes" right there
Jerry. You two will be together forever.
Marcee. How's my favorite player's wife?
Jerry, Rod is very very upset. Tyson, no!
How can I make your life better?
I know you say to take the Arizona offer, but my husband needs more recognition. _ 25.
You gonna get that --
Not a chance.
Marcee, things are changing around here. You and Rod will have my total personal attention.
Damn right, and you can start by taking Rod's poster and putting it where people can see it!
Damn right, and you can start by taking Rod's poster and putting it where people can see it!
Damn right.
I'll go back to them.
And say what? "Please remove your dick from my ass?!"
Okay, we don't take this emotionally. We roll with this problem.
What are you talking about -- "don't get emotional." If you ask me, you haven't gotten emotional ENOUGH about this man. _ 98.
Marcee --
What DO you stand for???
I'm sorry what I said back there.
Don't be silly.
Don't be silly.
My husband believes in you. We're gonna make it. Bye bye Dorothy.
He took a shot. He's unconscious.

I'm fine. What's up?
I came here to let you go. _ 27.
Pardon me?
Came here to fire you, Jerry.
Aw shit...the crowded restaurant... so there's no scene...
I know. It sucks. I suck.
You...
You did this to yourself. You said "fewer clients." You put it all on paper. Scully was very upset. Heart attacks make some people sweeter, but not him. You did this to yourself --
... dick?

Hi Ray.
And then my dad died and my mom took me to the zoo and I love the zoo. Do you hate the zoo or do you love the zoo?
Wait. I want to tell you more about my dad.
Wait. I want to tell you more about my dad.
Let's go the zoo.

I won't tell.
We'll go to the zoo sometime. Okay? I think I might have some time on my hands.
I don't see any.
Funny.

Funny... I better go to bed.
What's going on, Jerry?
A lot. We got a big fax today... we need this commission, buddy.
Show me the animal, Jerry!
Right up ahead, buddy --
-- I give you my favorite animal in the zoo. Are you ready for the weirdness, the strange perfection and truth of...
I'm scared. What is it?
I'm scared. What is it?
It's in a cage. Do not be scared of...
Now go kiss your daddy, quick.
That's why they cheer, you know. The white man sending the black man into battle...
He's gonna have nothing left for next season. They're letting him kill himself.
Can you be quiet?
Can you be quiet?
What'd I say?
He should have kept his head tucked down.
Shut up!!!
Shut up!!!
I'm not putting him down, I just have a commitment to the truth.
ERRR-IIIC!
And tell your wife to stop making so much noise! We're food to these damn animals.
Still, you have survived the dinosaurs before. You saved those kids.
A few of us survived. A lot more died. And we were better prepared and better armed. How many days have they been missing?
After what you've seen today, you really think your son could be alive?
He's smart, Dr. Grant. And he knows so much about dinosaurs.
Eric!
Quiet!
This is how you make dinosaurs?
This is how you play God.
Do you think it goes all the way across?
One way to find out.
Oh, my God.
What is it?
What is it?
A bird cage.
First off let me say as a dinosaur enthusiasts, Amanda and I have admired your work for years.
It is truly, whats the word? Inspiring.
Amanda and I, well, we just love the outdoors. Heck we've been on pretty much any adventure tour they can come up with: Galapagos, K2, the Nile...
We even have two seats reserved aboard the first commercial moon flight.
...once-in-a-lifetime.
We've arranged for a private airplane to take us flying over Isla Sorna. And we want you to be our guide.
Well, I'm no aviation specialist. But I do know it's hell of a lot lower than anyone else.
From what I understand, it's pretty much whatever we want.
Amanda, Honey! Dr. Grant says it's a bad idea!
What?
What?
He says it's a bad idea!
He says it's a bad idea!
What's a bad idea?
We can't just...
Don't worry, honey. We'll circle around and come back.
Her new boyfriend.
A friend. We were vacationing. Eric wanted to see the island and the dinosaurs, so Ben found a guy who would take them parasailing. They never came back.
A friend. We were vacationing. Eric wanted to see the island and the dinosaurs, so Ben found a guy who would take them parasailing. They never came back.
We called everyone, did everything we could. Because of all the controversy over this island, no one will step in. Costa Rica says it's a no-fly zone, it's their own damn fault. Guys at the U.S Embassy -- our U.S. Embassy -- said we should "accept the inevitable." You believe that?
Sorry.
Nothing you haven't seen before.
How much weight have you lost?
Twenty, twenty-fire pounds. I've been swimming at the Y.
Twenty, twenty-fire pounds. I've been swimming at the Y.
You hate to swim.
You hate to swim.
People change.
You look good.
So do you.
Stop that. Dr. Grant says this is dangerous territory.
Well we should split up or something. We can cover twice the area.
Well we should split up or something. We can cover twice the area.
No, Dr. Grant says...
No, Dr. Grant says...
Dr. Grant says this, Dr. Grant says that...
Dr. Grant says this, Dr. Grant says that...
Well what's the use of hiring an expert if your not going to listen to him?
Well what's the use of hiring an expert if your not going to listen to him?
Because "Dr. Grant" isn't looking for Eric. Dr. Grant is looking for the coast.

Fine...and when the Tricyclatops comes after you, don't come crying to me.

Oh, don't worry about that.
Oh, don't worry about that.
What?
What?
Nothing.
Nothing.
What did you say?
What did you say?
Nothing.
Nothing.
What did you say!
What did you say!
Just drop it Paul!
Young adult.
Eric...
That's him. Thats Eric!
I filmed this the morning they left.
I'm sorry Amanda. I am. And I'm sorry for the things I said about him.
No, it's...
No, it's...
I know you liked Ben. I had no right to...
I know you liked Ben. I had no right to...
Its not about him. It's Eric. He's alone out here somewhere. Our baby is all alone.
Eric! Are you here?
Eric!
Udesky.
He's this way.
It's not safe.
We have to help him.
We can't just stop looking. Eric and Dr. Grant are out there somewhere.
I want to find them too, but we can't do a bit of good right now. For every scary thing we saw in the daylight, I'll bet there ten times more of 'em at night. Am I right?
Well what?
Well damn it. I don't speak ill of the dead. What I'm trying to say is, its was just a crazy accident. The exact same thing could have happened if he was with me. You can't go beating yourself up about it.
This wouldn't happen if he was with you. I mean, you drive five miles below the speed limit. I totaled three cars in fives years.
That one time was just the bumper.
That one time was just the bumper.
He would have been, safe. Completely, entirely, suffocatingly safe. I would have him to see more of the world than Enid, Oklahoma. I wanted to see more of the world than Enid, Oklahoma. And so yes, it's my fault that this happened. I'm sorry that you have to be here.
I don't know. I don't have it with me.
When did you have it last?
When did you have it last?
I don't remember
I don't remember
Think.
What?...WHAT!?
I loaned it to Nash. He must have had it on him when he...
Sweetheart, you're okay. You're okay. You're okay.
Never had a doubt. Never did. Us Kirby men, we stick around, huh?
Eric, its okay. You'll be right behind me.
We're not going anywhere, I promise.
Paul! Where is he? Can you see him?
I'm trying! That thing took him down this way!
My own kid was right in front of me and I didn't do a damn thing.
You couldn't have made that jump.
You couldn't have made that jump.
I should have tried. It should have been me on that beach back there, not Billy.
I should have tried. It should have been me on that beach back there, not Billy.
How would you have helped Eric? He needs you, Paul. He needs us.
How would you have helped Eric? He needs you, Paul. He needs us.
He could have died.
He could have died.
But he didn't. And neither did you. And I'm glad about that.
We should try fishing again.
You mean it?
You mean it?
I do. It's worth another shot. And who knows? Things might turn out differently.
Either that, or the government will firebomb it back to the Stone Age.
I would completely support that.
You see, that's just the thing. Paul and I have special permission to fly low.
How low?
He's with a man named Ben Hildebrand.
Who's that?
I thought we weren't suppose to yell.
Here!
He's right. A predator wouldn't leave a kill wounded.
He's not a kill, he's still alive.
We need to stick to the plan. Head for the coast.
What about Eric and Dr. Grant?
What about Eric and Dr. Grant?
Going to the coast was Alan's idea. If he's alive, thats where he's headed.

What about Eric?
You had the phone the whole time?
Where is it?
PAUL!
DAD!
Where's Dad?
Just hold on.
We have to keep looking for Dad. We have to.
I know. I know. I want to look for him too.
I know. I know. I want to look for him too.
then we should...
Let me tell you a few things about you Dad, okay? He's very very very clever, very very brave, and he loves you ever very much.
He loves you too.
He loves you too.
Okay. He loves us very very much. And I know that right now more than anything, your Dad would want to know that we're safe. Okay?
That was Isla Nublar. This is Isla Sorna. The second island.
I didn't know, there were two islands.
So Mr. Kirby, tell me, when you climbed K2, did you base camp at 25- or 30,000 feet?
Thirty-thousand, I think. Closer to the top.
Thirty-thousand, I think. Closer to the top.
About a thousand feet above it, actually. Most mountain-climbers remember how tall that mountains were.
They couldnt climb up, so they were trying to get us to come down.
They set a trap They actually set a trap.
I dont know.
I thought you were an expert.
I thought you were an expert.
Dr. Grant was.
He's probably has a better chance by the coast as it is. Figures that all the big dinosaurs would live in the center of the island. Right?
Sure.
Eric!
It won't hold!
How was your trip? Profitable?
We'll be broke in four weeks.
We'll be broke in four weeks.
Three weeks. I had to rent some equipment.
You rented an automated litter box.
It's a rapid prototyper. I feed in the scan data from the raptor skull, than the computer breaks it into thousands of slices which this thing prints, one layer on top of the other. It's the future of paleontology.

Not if it can't dig.
Absolutely not.
They're here.
They're here.
What?
Even with what I pay you, you could get a better bag.
No way. This is lucky. Couple years ago some buddies and I went hang gliding off these cliffs in New Zealand. Updraft sent me right into the side. BOOM!

Reverse-Darwinism. Survival of the most idiotic.
Listen Alan, I really appreciate you bringing me along.
The bones will be there when we get back. That's the nice thing about them. They never run away. And besides, you got me into this. I don't intend to be alone with these people.
I'm so use to seeing bones. It's weird to see skin.
Mr. and Mrs. Kirby! If you look out the right you can see...
Is it a rex?
I don't think so.
How would you classify it?
Obviously a superpredator. Suchimimus. that snout.

I don't remember that on InGen's list.
I don't remember that on InGen's list.
That's because it wasn't on their list. Who knows what else they were up to?
It looks intact.
We should take it with us to signal any planes.
We could co-write a paper.
Ah yes, the first rule of academics. Publish or perish.
ALAN!
KEEP GOING!
We need to keep moving.
Alan, I want to tell you that I'm so sorry about the...
Alan, I want to tell you that I'm so sorry about the...
Billy, I can't talk to you now.
You have to believe me. I did it with the best intentions.
Some of the worst things imaginable have been done with the best intentions. You rushed in with no thought to the consequences, to yourself or anyone else. You're no better than the people who built this place.
I CAN GET HIM!
NO!
NO!
I KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES!
Hmm?
He's three. Why don't you wait till he's a little older?
He used to know me.
Sorry, Alan it's been six years.
So, Mark's working at the State Department now.
Really? What do you do there?
Anything good?
Raptors, mostly.
Raptors, mostly.
My favorite.
You remember the sounds they made?
I try not to.
I try not to.
We've done cranial scans, and raptors actually had a quite sophisticated resonating chamber. I have a theory that their ability to vocalize is the key to their social intelligence. The way they can work together as a team.

You think they could talk to each other?

To a degree we never imagined.
Good luck with the fund raising.
It was never easy, but before Jurassic Park, you could find money. Somewhere. Now fossils are out. Everyone wants to see a real live dinosaur.

I'd better get going.
Let me know if I can help, Alan. Youre bad about asking for help, but please ask me. Anything, anytime.

Okay. Goodbye, Ellie.
Okay. Goodbye, Ellie.
Goodbye, Alan.
When I met you, I thought that one day millions of years ago, all the dinosaurs became extinct. Wiped out. But you told me otherwise. When conditions changed, dinosaurs changed. They became other things. They evolved.
A well-accepted theory.
A well-accepted theory.
Alan don't be afraid to evolve.
Eric, your parents are both here.
In Costa Rica?
In Costa Rica?
On the island.
They'll never make it. I mean, they can't manage when the cable goes out.
You'd be surprised what people can do when they have too.
You're Alan Grant, aren't you? I read both of your books.
Which one do you prefer?
Which one do you prefer?
The first one. Before you where on the island. You liked dinosaurs back then.
The first one. Before you where on the island. You liked dinosaurs back then.
Back then, they hadn't tried to eat me.
When InGen cleared out, they left a lot of stuff behind.
Any weapons, radios?
Found this, but the battery's dead.
It's a wonder you aren't. I'm amazed, Eric. I barely lasted 30 hours. You lasted eight weeks.
Is that all it's been? I thought it was longer.
The important thing is we both made it. That's something we have in common.
Did you read Malcolm's book?
Yeah.
Yeah.
What did you think?
What did you think?
I dunno. I mean, it was kind of preachy. Chaos-this, chaos-that. And like, to me, the guy seemed kind of high on himself.
Know what this is?
A raptor claw. I use to have one. A fossil.
A raptor claw. I use to have one. A fossil.
Mine's new.
How much of this island have you explored?
I stayed pretty close to the compound, Figured if anyone came to look for me, that's where they'd start.

We need to head for the coast.
We need to head for the coast.
Are you sure?
Are you sure?
Why?
Why?
Closer you get to the water, the bigger things get.
We climb down to the barge and follow the river out to the ocean. With any luck, the Costa Rican coast guard will pick us up.
Then we go home?
Do you have any kids?
No. Although I've studied them in the wild.
I have a theory that there's two kinds of boys. Those who want to be astronomers and those who want to be astronauts.
I want to be an astronaut.
I want to be an astronaut.
See, I was the opposite. I never understood why anyone would want to go into space. It's so dangerous. You do one thing wrong and you're dead. The astronomer -- or the paleontologist -- get to study these amazing things from a place of complete safety. And truthfully, everything you really need to learn, you can learn it from the ground.

Exactly. The difference between imagining how things might be and seeing how they really are. To be able to touch them. That's what Billy wanted to do.
Bonitas.
Something must've scared them.
The lady you called, how do you know she can help us?
She's the one person I could always count on. And she's saved me more times than she realizes. I owe her everything.
It's strikes me now I never told her that.
You should.
You should.
You're right.
Eric, do you know what happened to the boat? that brought you here? Why did it crash?
No. I couldn't see.
No. I couldn't see.
Do me a favor. Go back to your parents for a minute, would you? They look worried.
We're safe!
No we're not.
What do you think is going to happen with the dinosaurs?
The population will Stabilize eventually. They'll adapt to fit different roles.
What can I do for you, Mr. Kirby?
Well sir, I am a great admirer of yours, and I have an extremely interesting proposition to discuss. Would you let my wife and I take you to have dinner tonight? Our treat.

I guarantee it'll be worth your while.
Hmmm.
Now, for our wedding anniversary this year we wanted to do something really special, something...
That's a very nice offer, Mr. Kirby, but I'm afraid I'm much to busy. If you like I can refer you to a number of highly qualified...
No, no, see Dr. Grant, you're the best. You've seen these animals in the flesh. No one else has come close to you.
No, no, see Dr. Grant, you're the best. You've seen these animals in the flesh. No one else has come close to you.
I'm flattered, but I've taken this little adventure tour. And with the air restrictions they've imposed after the incident in San Diego, you cant fly low enough to see anything of interest.
That's hard to believe.
Let's just say that through my business -- imports/exports, emerging markets -- I've made some friends in high places. In this case, the Costa Rican government.
Dr. Grant if you'd just sit tight, we'll explain this all in a jiffy.
This plane can not land!
What the hell is going on? What are they doing?
Establishing a perimeter. Making it safe. These guys are really good. One of them was a Green...
Establishing a perimeter. Making it safe. These guys are really good. One of them was a Green...
Mr. Kirby, trust me, on this island, there is no such thing as safe. We have to get back in this plane...
We needed somebody who knew the lay of the land. Somebody who'd been to this island before.
I have never been on this island!
I have never been on this island!
Sure you have. You wrote that book...
No, I'm sorry, but no. We'll savage what we can from the plane. Then we head for the coast. There may be a boat left, something to get us off this island.
Dr. Grant, we're not leaving without our son.
Dr. Grant, we're not leaving without our son.
You can stick with us, or you can go and look for him. Either way you're probably not getting out of here alive.
There is no Kirby Enterprises, is there?
There is. I own a place called Kirby Paint and Title Plus. We're out in the Westgate Shopping Center in Enid, Oklahoma. The "plus" is for bathroom fixtures, fireplaces accessories, patio furniture. Stuff like that.
Well that's good.
But you never came across just one.
Amanda!
Back out! Move!
Billy!
It's no use, Dr. Grant. No use.
Whatever you do, don't call the U.S. Embassy. They won't do a God Damn thing.
Well, we don't exactly have a Costa Rican phone book here, so it will have to be somebody we know in the states. Someone we can absolutely count on to send help.

You. Tell me, Roland, when was the last time you answered your phone?
Last time I plugged it in, I suppose. Why?
I got a call from a gentleman who's going to Costa Rica, or thereabouts. If he's to be believed, it's a most, uh, unique expedition. And very well-funded.
Well, I'm a very well-funded old son of a bitch. You go.
But alone? We always had great success together, you and I.
Just a little bit too much, I think.
Just a little bit too much, I think.
How do you mean?
How do you mean?
A true hunter doesn't mind if the animal wins. If it escapes. But there weren't enough escapes from you and me, Ajay. I've decided to spend a bit less time in the company of death. Maybe I just feel too close to it my--
Sorry. We were saying?
You broke that idiot's jaw for no reason other than your boredom. Tell the truth, Roland. Aren't you even interested in knowing this expedition's quarry?
You broke that idiot's jaw for no reason other than your boredom. Tell the truth, Roland. Aren't you even interested in knowing this expedition's quarry?
Ajay. Go on up to my ranch, take a look around the trophy room, and tell me what kind of quarry you think could possibly be of any interest to me.
It matches the pictures.
It certainly does.
Make a blind here? Wait for the buck to return?
If the nest is upwind, so are we. When he comes back, he'll know we're here before we have a chance. The truck --

No. I feel something.
Any damage?

Like if you shoot yourself in the foot? Wouldn't matter. You'd be dead before you realized you'd accidentally pulled the trigger.
Why didn't you tell us about these guys, Ian?!
Because I didn't know! I don't have the faintest idea what they're doing here.
Resentful.
When you have a lot of time to think, it's funny who you remember. It's the people who challenged you. It is the quality of our opponents that gives our accomplishments meaning. I never told you how sorry I was about what happened after we returned.
I didn't know you -- weren't well.
It's the lawyers. The lawyers are finally killing me.

You were right -- and I was wrong. There! Did you ever think you'd hear me say that? Spectacularly wrong. Instead of observing those animals, I tried to control them. I squandered an opportunity and we still know next to nothing about their lives. Not their lives as man would have them, behind electric fences, but in the wild. Behavior in their natural habitat,

After the accident at the park, a hurricane wiped out our facility on Site B. We had to evacuate and leave the animals to fend for themselves. And they did. For four years I've fought to keep them safe from human meddling, now I want you to go there and document them.

I've been putting this together for over a year. I have personal suggestions for your entire team, phone numbers, contact people. They won't believe you about what they're going to see, so don't bother trying to convince them. Just use my checkbook to get them there. I'll fund your expedition through my personal accounts, as such money and equipment as you need, but only

You'll need an animal behaviorist, someone with unimpeachable credentials. I believe you already know Sarah Harding. She's got theories about parenting and nurturing among hunter/scavengers I bet she'd be dying to prove on a scale like this. If you convince her to go, it'll be a major coup. When she publishes, the scientific community must take it seriously.
I'm not going, John.
Ian, you are my last chance to give something of real value to the world. I can't walk so far and leave no footprints; die and leave nothing with my name on it. I will not be known only for my failures. And you will not allow yourself to go down in history as a lunatic. You're too smart. You'e too proud. Dr. Malcolm.
Oh --

InGen is a genetics corporation, isn't it?
Is that who we're really working for?! Gene splicers?!
But he's the head of InGen!
You gotta be kidding. You dragged me out of Greenpeace to be a corporate stooge? You couldn't get anybody else?
Are you looking for a problem?
Everyone, keep your voices down!
That was a pair bond! A family group, even, long after that infant was nestbound!
I want to see the nesting ground!
The empty shells are crushed and trampled. The young stay in the birth environment, that's conclusive!
Not without a shot of the nest.
Ian, you're not insane! I'm so glad!
Dr. Malcolm -- the world -- owes you an apology.
And let's forget about the high hide. We can't do this kind of work up in a tower, we need to be out in the field, as close to the animals as possible.
I'm not surprised stegosaur lived in a family group, but there's never been anything in the fossil record to prove the carnivores did.

Okay, Karen is expecting you in half an hour. You only have to stay with her one night, she'll put you on a bus in the morning and your mother will be at the station when you get there.
I don't even know this woman.
I don't even know this woman.
Well, I do, and she's fantastic. She'll take you to the museum, maybe to a movie if you play your cards right. You're going to have a fantastic time.

I can't tell you. But I'll be back within a week.

Very hurtful. Your mother tell you to say that?
Very hurtful. Your mother tell you to say that?
No, Dad. I have thoughts of my own once in a while.
Is that kid still bothering you?
Which one?
Which one?
You know, at the bus stop. With the hair?

That was about a year ago.

No. Richard talked to his parents.

I could come with you.
Out of the question. You'd miss the gymnastics trials. You've been training for that for a year.

This is nothing like Austin. Forget about it.
You like to have kids, you just don't want to be with them, do you?
How could you possibly?
Because you said so. Maybe nobody else believed you, but I always did.
"InGen." What's InGen?
Where does it say that?
Where does it say that?
On the side of that one truck.
What are you guys gonna do?
Exactly what John Hammond wanted us to do.
Are you all right?! Anything broken?
I'm fine, I'm fine, I was scared, I thought you, are you okay?!
I'm fine, I'm fine, I was scared, I thought you, are you okay?!
I'm fine... I'm fine...
Dad!
Come on!
Cancel that, Dieter.
What? Why?
Carnivores hunt near stream beds. Do you want to set up base camp or an all-you-can-eat people bar?
You heard his, Dieter. Find a new spot. And remember, we're after herbivores only -- no unnecessary risks.
Peter, if you want me to run your little camping trip, there are two conditions. First -- I'm in charge, and when I'm not around, Dieter is. Your job is to sign the checks, tell us we're doing a good job, and open your case of scotch when we have a good day. Second condition -- my fee. You can keep it. All I
Okay.
Okay.
Good lad.
Where do you think you're going?!
To collect my fee.
What kind of gun is that?
My father's .600 Nitro Express. Made in 1904. Karimojo Bell gave it to him after he took down his last elephant. 8700 foot pound striking force.

Forty yards. Less, maybe. I assume it'll take a slug in the brain case to bring him down.

Why not just use a scope and a poison dart and snipe him from a hill?
You rally think this'll draw the parent?
I once saw a bull elephant die charging a jeep. All the jeep had done was startle the bull's calves. I saw a lioness carry wounded prey four and a half miles, all the way back to its den, just to teach its cubs how to finish off a kill.

You're kidding yourself. An adult T-rex cares about one thing -- filling its own belly. It acts the way people wish they could, that's why everyone's fascinated by it. If people had the chance to see one dinosaur and one only, ninety-nine percent would --

You've broken its leg!
You've broken its leg!
We've got to transport it seven thousand miles. Would you prefer it bit off the leg of a crew member?
What in Christ's name is going on?!
Isn't it obvious?
What is?
The velociraptors.
What is that?
Piss.
Where's the power and radio setup?
Operations building. Far end of the street.
The radio rig is inside. It runs directly from the geothermal generator, so power shouldn't be a problem.
Good.
Do you think the rex might have the infant with it?
Possible.
We took to the rock.
Why?
It's... behind... us.
It's just fed. It won't attack unless it's threatened. Don't move.
If I don't move, I can't shoot it.
Let it go, Peter. The animal won.
So, you two were just, uh, telling old campfire stories, were you?
Do me a favor. Don't pretend for a second that you and I don't know the truth. You can convince Time magazine and the Skeptical Inquirer of whatever you want, but I was there.

InGen is my livelihood, Dr. Malcolm, and I will jealously defend its interests. People will know what I want them to know when I want them to know it.
What's he got in there?
Piss.
Trespassing, sabotage -- you could go to jail just for being here, did you know that?
Don't start a legal argument with me, this island isn't your property, and neither are these animals!
Their what?
Oh, God.
What?
Don't ask me. The guy's completely out to lunch.
You know how to work a radio, don't you?
You're going too?
You're going too?
I lost everything I came after on this trip, but one T-rex in one theme park could single-handedly bail InGen out of Chapter 11.
She's gutty.
She's nuts.
No way.
Oh, my God.
Do you see any family resemblance here?
You can't stay, Kelly, that's it. It's too dangerous.
Then this is our chance.
Our chance to do what?
Our chance to do what?
I don't know these guys, but I know 'em. I've seen 'em on Japanese whalers, French barges trying to dump barrels of nuclear waste in the North Atlantic. They're all the same. They spray us with water cannon when we try to stop 'em, sink our boats, and then call us crazy.
There' no reason for name calling.
Dr. Juttson, please take Kelly back to camp right away. Leave the other car for us and we'll meet you there in an hour or so.

It has a broken leg!

What are they?

Come on!

I think she's with Sarah!

DAMN IT, BE SURE!!
Something's wrong.
Look! Sarah!
No. I'm quite certain you can't.
Look, we have two choices. We can hike back down to the lagoon, where we can sit for two days, in the open, next to a heavily used water source while we're waiting for your boat to arrive, or we can head for the village, where we might find some shelter and we can call for help.

We'd never make it past the raptors. Trust me, I have some experience in this matter.
You ever heard of Gambler's Ruin?
What's that?
What's that?
A statistical phenomenon. Says everything in the world goes in streaks. It's real, you see it everywhere -- in weather, in river flooding, in baseball, in blackjack, in stock markets. Once things go bad, they tend to stay bad. Bad things cluster. They go to hell together.

I don't care about my life. But if I'd ever thought for a second that she would be in danger --
Somewhere on this island, there exits the greatest predator that ever lived. And the second greatest predator must take him down.
But why?
But why?
You remember that guy, about twenty years ago, I forget his name, but he climbed Everest without any oxygen, came down almost dead. And they asked him, "why did you go up there to die?" And he said "I didn't. I went up there to live."

It's called self-testing. But in your case, it sounds more like self-destruction. A uniquely human characteristic. In fact, human beings destroy things so well that I sometimes think that's our function. Maybe every few sons, some animal comes along that kills off the rest of the world, clears the decks, and lets evolution proceed to his next phase. Maybe death and destruction are our
How many rounds did you find for that weapon?
Four, counting the one in the chamber.
Four, counting the one in the chamber.
Don't let it out of your hands again. Can the kid walk?
You gentlemen feel you have to do this now?
Now's the perfect time. The animal just fed, so it won't stalk us for food. Predators don't hurt when they're not hungry.
No more smoking. We leave no scent of any kind. No hair tonics, no cologne, seal all our food in plastic bags. We will observe and document, but we will not interact.
That's a scientific impossibility, you know. Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Whatever you study, you also change.
You know you were putting yourself in a potentially dangerous situation, but you didn't bother to find out how dangerous before you leapt in. You don't have the faintest idea what's going on on this island!
What do you want to do, Ian, lock her up for curiosity? Where do you think she gets it?
You're going home. I'm sending a radio call for the boats. We'll all go down to the lagoon and wait for them.
Lighten up, Ian, you sound like a high school vice-principal.

No! We're an independently funded expedition.

John Hammond.
Can you set up?

It has to be temporary, something that'll break apart and fall off as the animal grows...
Think fast, Sarah.
That's impossible, they can't have the sensory equipment to track it all the way here!
Current evidence seems to be to the contrary, wouldn't you say?! GIVE IT TO THEM!
Born free, as free as the wind blows. As free as the grass grows --
Are you insane?!
Are you insane?!
I swear to God, it works with lions sometimes! There we are -- your baby is free --
All right. I'm satisfied with the evidence we have right now. I feel vindicated. John Hammond will too. Do you have enough to publish?
They will come after me. But I can collect some stool samples, for DNA with that, Nick's tapes, and the rest of you to back me up, it should stand when we get back.
They will come after me. But I can collect some stool samples, for DNA with that, Nick's tapes, and the rest of you to back me up, it should stand when we get back.
Then the only thing left to do is make sure we do get back. I'll call the mainland on the satellite phone and have them send the boat right now. This expedition is over.
Oh, God.
What?!
What?!
They're pushing us over the cliff.
You know, even if we do get those tapes back, people are going to say it's just another hoax. Ian Malcolm's alien autopsy.
Maybe. Maybe not.
Maybe. Maybe not.
Ian, they will misplace our evidence, shoot holes in our testimony, and say some special effects genius created the animals. The only way people will ever believe that dinosaurs exist is if you dump a T-rex in the middle of times Square.
Ian. It's guano.
What?
What?
These formations. They're dried --

So what's your story, Nick?

I believe in him.
-- way we could safely --
Oh, no!
The kid scores with cheap sentiment.
Ian, if we recall the boat now, we've made two invasive landings in one day. That'll have to go in any paper I write, and it will leave room for people to say our findings were contaminated. You know the academic world as well as I do, once they smell blood in the water, you're dead. Our presence has got to be one hundred
Ruining everything, that's what they're doing. You could choke on the diesel smoke already!
Ian, nothing we observe will be valid if we're trailing along in the wake of an army.
That little black line?
That little black line means death for this infant. The fibula won't heal straight, so the ankle joint can't pivot when he stands on his hind feet. The baby won't be able to run, and probably can't even walk. It'll be crippled, and a predator will pick it off before it gets more than a few weeks old.
Give it more morphine!
We'll kill it with too much, we'll put it into respiratory arrest! I'm almost done. Damn it, I need another adhesive, something pliable I can --
Hold it down, Nick!
I'm trying!
There's, uh -- there's an unwritten rule when a news crew is in a war zone. You stop the van every two miles and decide whether or not to go on. Whether or not you feel lucky. One "no" from anybody in the group and you turn around right there, no question asked, nobody embarrassed. Well? Do we go on? Immediately:
No.
WHAT ARE YOU-
JUMP!
Where's Kelly?
Where's Ian?
Hey, we came here to observe, you came here to strip-mine the place! It's a looter mentality, all you care about is what you can take.
None of that matters. Our communications equipment's been destroyed. If your radio and satellite phone were in those trailers that went off the cliff, and I'm guessing by the look on his face --
If we can't stay in the rex's territory, we have to move tonight.
Move where? Our boat's not coming for two days, your airlift is waiting for an order you have no way to send --
We have to send someone to look for him!
You go if you like, but we're not waiting for you. MOVE IT OUT!!
Ask her.
Can the kid walk?
You've got to be kidding.
Runs against my nature to hole up in a cave and wait.
Uh - - Mr. Hammond - -
Stop the program! Stop the program!
That storm center hasn't dissipated or changed course. We're going to have to cut the tour short, I'm afraid. Pick it up again tomorrow where we left off.
You're sure we have to?
You're sure we have to?
It's not worth taking the chance, John.
Ladies and gentlemen, last shuttle to the dock leaves in approximately five minutes. Drop what you are doing and leave now.
Damn!
I found a way to re-route through the program. I'm turning the cars around in the rest area loop.
Rotten luck, this storm. Get my grandchildren on the radio will you? I don't want them to worry about a wee bit of rain.
Visitor vehicles are on their way back to the garage.
So how much for our first tour. Two no-shows and one sick triceratops.

Well, Nedry said a few systems would go off-line, didn't he?

The monitors are failing.
Phones are out too.
Where did the vehicles stop?
We're talking, my dear, about a calculated risk, which is the only option left to us. We will never find the command NEDRY used. He covered his tracks far too well, and I think it's obvious he's not coming back. So shutting down the system - -
I will not do it. You'll have to get somebody else, because I will not.
I will not do it. You'll have to get somebody else, because I will not.

Theoretically, yeah , but we've never shut down the whole system. It may not come back at all.
Are we getting anywhere with these procedures of yours? I mean, what's hanging us up?
I ran a key check on every stroke Nedry entered today. It's all pretty standard stuff, until this one - -

What one?
How many lines of code are there?
Uh - - about two million.
Uh - - about two million.
Two million - - great. That would help. Oh good, that'll take no time.
No, no, no, that's crazy, you're out of your mind, he's absolutely out of his mind - -
Wait a minute. What exactly does this mean?
But would we get the phones back?
Yeah, again, in theory, but - -
The lysine contingency - it's intended to prevent the spread of the animals is case they ever got off the island, but we could use it now. Dr. Wu inserted a gene that makes a single faulty enzyme in protein metabolism. Animals can't manufacture the amino acid lysine. Unless they're continually supplied with lysine by us, they'll go into a coma and die.
How would we cut off the lysine?
How would we cut off the lysine?
No trick to it. Just stop running the program. Leaving them unattended.
How long will this take?
'Bout thirty seconds.
You shouldn't use my name.
Dodgson, Dodgson. We got Dodgson here! See, nobody cares. Nice hat. What are you trying to look like, a secret agent?
Oh, I'll get 'em all.
Remember - - viable embryos. They're no use to us if they don't survive.

I got an eighteen minute window. Eighteen minutes, and your company catches up on ten years of research.
Paleo-DNA? From what source? Where do you get 100 million year old dinosaur blood?!
Shhhhh!
Please - - let's hear something from the others. Dr. Grant? I am sorry - - Dr. Sattler?
The question is - - how much can you know about an extinct ecosystem, and therefore, how could you assume you can control it? You have plants right here in this building, for example, that are poisonous. You picked them because they look pretty, but these are aggressive living things that have no idea what century they're living in and will defend themselves. Violently,
Alan? Where are we going? You see something?
Uh - - anybody else think we shouldn't be out here?
Yours was fully illustrated, honey.
Anybody at all. Feel free to speak up.
Doctors, if you please - - I have to insist we get moving.
Oh, you know, if it's alright, I'd like to stay with Dr. Harding and finish with the trike. Is that okay?
Imbalance, disorientation, labored breathing. Seems to happen about every six weeks or so.
Six weeks?
Yes, mitotic, pupils should be constricted.
These are dilated. Take a look.
These are dilated. Take a look.
They are? I'll be damned.
They are? I'll be damned.
That's pharmacological. From local plant life.
Yes. We know they're toxic, but the animals don't eat them.
Are you sure?
Are you sure?
Pretty sure.
Pretty sure.
There's only one way to be positive. I need to see some droppings. I have to see the dinosaur's droppings.
There's only one way to be positive. I need to see some droppings. I have to see the dinosaur's droppings.
You won't be able to miss them. Can't miss them.
Sure. I've got a gas powered jeep. I can drop her at the visitor's center before I make the boat with the others.
I'll catch up with you. You can go with the others.
Did I say jerk?
I'm sorry for the dramatic entrance, but I'm in a hurry. Will you have a wee bit of a drink now and then?
I have samples all over the kitchen.
Come along. I know my way around a kitchen. Come along.
There you are. Out you come.
Oh my God.
Oh my God.
Could I have a tissue please?
Fascinating animals, fascinating.
Oh my God.
Oh my God.
Give time, they'll out draw the T-rex. Guarantee it.
Alan, these aren't bones anymore.
We're - - still perfecting a viewing system. The raptors seem to be a bit resistant to integration into a park setting.
Malcolm's okay for now. I gave him a shot of morphine.
They'll all be fine. Who better to get the children through Jurassic Park than a dinosaur expert?
Carousel.
A carousel - - and a seesaw. They all moved, motorized of course, but people would swear they could see the fleas. "I see the fleas, mummy! Can't you see the fleas?" Clown fleas, high wire fleas, fleas on parade...
But with this place, I - - I wanted to give them something real, something that wasn't an illusion, something they could see and touch. An aim devoid of merit.
But you can't think through this one. You have to feel it.
But you can't think through this one. You have to feel it.
You're absolutely right. Yes, you're right. Hiring Nedry was a mistake, that's obvious. We're over- dependent on automation, I can see that now. But that's all correctable for the next time around.
You're absolutely right. Yes, you're right. Hiring Nedry was a mistake, that's obvious. We're over- dependent on automation, I can see that now. But that's all correctable for the next time around.
John, John. John, you're still building onto that Flea Circus, that illusion. And now you're adding onto it by what you're doing here. That's the illusion.
Once we have control again we - -
Control?! You never had control! I was overwhelmed by the power of this place. So I made a mistake too. I didn't have enough respect for that power, and it's out now. You're sitting here trying to pick up the pieces. John, there's nothing worth picking up. The only thing that matters now are the people we love. Alan, Lex, and Tim. And John,
This is just a delay, that's all this is. All major theme parks have had delays. When they opened Disneyland in 1956, nothing worked, nothing.

Okay, I'm following the tubing. I'm going down a passage way. How long does this stuff go for? Could you guys talk a little bit to me?
Four complete skeletons. . . . such a small area. . . the same time horizon - -
They died together?
They died together?
The taphonomy sure looks that way.
The taphonomy sure looks that way.
If they died together, they lived together. Suggests some kind of social order.
A drought. The lake was shrinking - -
That's good. That's right! They died around a dried-up puddle! Without fighting each other. This is looking good.
Postmortem contraction of the posterior neck ligaments. Velociraptor?
Yes. Good shape, too. Five, six feet high. I'm guessing nine feet long. Look at the - -
You know, if you really wanted to scare the kid you could've just pulled a gun on him.
Yeah, I know, you know...kids. You want to have one of those?

Oh, Ellie, look. They're noisy, they're messy, they're sticky, they're expensive.

Cheap, cheap, cheap.

They smell.

Oh my god, they do not! They don't smell.
Oh my god, they do not! They don't smell.
They do smell. Some of them smell.. babies smell.

Anything else, you old fossil?

Yeah, plenty. Some of them can't walk!
Yeah, plenty. Some of them can't walk!
It frustrates me so much that I love you, that I need to strangle you right now!
Okay, who's the jerk?
Uh, this is our paleobotanist, Dr Ellie.....
Uh, this is our paleobotanist, Dr Ellie.....
Sattler.
And what are those?
Small versions of adults, honey.
Why would they care what we think?
What kind of park is it?
The movement!
The - - agility. You're right!
Ellie, we can tear up the rule book on cold-bloodedness. It doesn't apply, they're totally wrong! This is a warm-blooded creature. They're totally wrong.
They were wrong. Case closed. This thing doesn't live in a swamp to support it's body weight for God's sake!
You've got a T-rex!? He's got a T-rex! A T-rex! He said he's- -
Say again?
Ellie, they're absolutely - - they're moving in herds. They do move in herds!
We were right!
We were right!
How did you do it?! How did you do this?!
So what are you thinking?
We're out of a job.
Wait a minute! How do you interrupt the cellular mitosis?!?
Can't we see the unfertilized host eggs?!
Oh, shit.
Dilophosaurus.
Oh Ellie. It's so beautiful. It's the most beautiful thing I ever saw.
It's my favorite.
Ellie, I've been thinking there's something about the periodicity doesn't had up.
I know.
Constantly sick.
Not just every six weeks.

Yeah, I know.
Elm that's it, it explains the periodicity, the - -

And when she swallows the stones, she swallows the poison berries too. That's what makes her sick. Good work Tim.
Are you sure?
I'll just finish. Yeah, I want to finish.
It's just the two raptors, right? You're sure the third one's contained?
Yes, unless they figured out how to open doors.
Ellie - - get back and boot up the door locks!
You can't hold it by yourself!
You can't hold it by yourself!
Ellie, get the gun! Try to reach the gun!
Ellie, get the gun! Try to reach the gun!
I can't get it! I can't get it unless I move!
They show extreme intelligence, even problem solving. Especially the big one. We bred eight originally, but when she came in, she took over the pride and killed all but two of the others. That one - -when she looks at you, you can see she's thinking working things out. She's the reason we have to feed 'em like this. She had them all attacking
The fences are electrified, right?
The fences are electrified, right?
That's right. But they never attack the same place twice. They were testing the fences for weaknesses. Systematically. They remembered.
Dr. Sattler, I've seen a lot of animal attacks. People just disappear. No blood, no trace. That's the way it happens.
No, no, no!
Ellie, com one!!
The other car!
Dr. Grant!
Alan!
Do you see anything?
I don't know.
Alan?!
They're not here.
What about the lysine contingency? We could put that into effect!
What's that?
I can't wait anymore. Something went wrong. I'm going to go get the power back on.
You can't just stroll down the road, you know.
I'm going with you.
Okay.
Come on, let's go.
We'll discuss sexism in survival situations when I get back. You just take me through this step by step. I'm on channel two.
Okay, I'm on channel two.
Stick to my heels.
Oh my God. Aw, God.
The shutdown must have turned off all the fences. Goddamn it! Even Nedry knew better than to mess with the raptor fence.
C'mon on, this way.
I can see the shed from here! We can make it if we run!
No. We can't.
Why not?
Why not?
Because we're being hunted. From the bushes straight ahead.
It's all right.
Like hell it is!
No.
No? Non-linear equations? Strange attractions? Dr. Sattler, I refuse to believe that you are not familiar with the concept of attraction!
That's right. Will break through.
I get ah - -

No one could have predicted Dr. Grant would suddenly jump out of a moving vehicle!

Can we chance moving him?
Please - - chance it.

Seven days?! Seven days?! Oh, great. Oh good - - clever.
That'll - it'd be a first; man and dinosaur all die together. John's plan.
Yes?

Yes. It's not a criticism, by the way.
Hola, Juanito
Hola, bienvenido
What's this I hear at the airport Hammond's not even here?
He sends his apologies.
He sends his apologies.
You're telling me that we're facing a $20 million lawsuit from the family of that injured worker and Hammond couldn't even be bothered to see me?
You're telling me that we're facing a $20 million lawsuit from the family of that injured worker and Hammond couldn't even be bothered to see me?
He had to leave early to be with his daughter. She's getting a divorce.
He had to leave early to be with his daughter. She's getting a divorce.
I understand that. I'm sorry to hear that. We'd be well advised to deal with this situation now. The insurance company - -
Hammond hates inspections. They slow everything down.
Juanito, if they pull the funding, that will really slow things down. If they pull the funding that's going to slow things down around here.
If two experts sign off on the island, the insurance guys'll back off. I already got Ian Malcolm, but they think he's too trendy. They want Alan Grant.
Grant? You'll never get him out of Montana.
Grant? You'll never get him out of Montana.
Why not?
Why not?
Because he's like me. He's a digger.
I can't see.
What are we looking for?
What are we looking for?
Dilophosaurus.
Up and down, up and down!
I can't believe we invited Ian Malcolm.
I can't believe we invited Ian Malcolm.
People were gettin' bloody noses - - things on your head - - aneurisms - -
Hey! Where did you find those things?
In a box under my seat.
In a box under my seat.
Are they heavy?

Yeah.
Yeah.
Then they're expensive. Put them back.
The full fifty mile of perimeter fence are in place?
And the concrete moats, and the motion sensor tracking systems. Donald, dear boy, do try to relax and enjoy yourself.

Let's get something straight, John. This is not a weekend excursion, this is a serious investigation of the stability of the island. Your investors, whom I represent, are deeply concerned. Forty-eight hours from now, if they - - - -aren't convinced. I'm not convinced. And I can shut you down John.

Forty-eight hours from now, I'll be accepting your apologies. Now get out of the way. So I can see them!
This is overwhelming, John. Are these characters animatronics?
No, we don't have any animatronics here. These are the real miracle workers of Jurassic Park.
John, we - - what I'm just saying....
Relax Donald, relax. They're scientists. They ought to be curious.
And we can charge anything we want! Two thousand a day, ten thousand a day - - people will pay it! And then there's the merchandising - -
Donald, this park was not built to carter only to the super rich. Everyone in the world's got a right to enjoy these animals.
Donald, this park was not built to carter only to the super rich. Everyone in the world's got a right to enjoy these animals.
Sure, they will, they will. We'll have a - - coupon day or something.
- - from combined revenue streams for all three parks should reach eight to nine billion dollars a year - -
That's conservative, of course. There's no reason to speculate wildly.
That's conservative, of course. There's no reason to speculate wildly.
I've never been a rich man. I hear it's nice. Is it nice?
I don't believe it. I expected you to come down here and defend me from these characters and the only one I've got on my side it the bloodsucking lawyer!?
Thank you.
Have a heart gentlemen. Their parents are getting a divorce and they need the diversion.
Hey! Where are the brakes?
Hey! Where are the brakes?
Brakes? No. No brakes. They're electric cars, guided by this track in the roadway, and totally non-polluting, top of the line!
I read your book.
Oh, yeah - - great.
Because they sure don't look like birds to me. I heard a meteor hit the earth and made like this one hundred mile crater someplace down in Mexico - -
Listen, ahh - -
Listen, ahh - -
Tim.
Tim.
Tim. Which car were you planning on - -
Tim. Which car were you planning on - -
Whichever one you are.
And his book was a lot fatter than yours.
Really?
These look kind of familiar.
Triceratops was a constant browser, and constant browsers would be constantly sick.
Are you okay? Can you move? Tim! Are you okay?
Tim, are you okay?
Tim, are you okay?
I'm stuck. The seat's got my feet!
I'm stuck. The seat's got my feet!
Tim, I'll come back for you. I'll get Lex out first.
I threw up.
That's okay. Listen, give me your hand.
Okay, that's not so bad, ah Tim?
Yes it is.
Yes it is.
It's just like coming out of a tree house. Did your dad ever build you a tree house, Tim, eh?
It's just like coming out of a tree house. Did your dad ever build you a tree house, Tim, eh?

'Course you could just wait in there while we go back and get help.
That's a good idea.
That's a good idea.
You'll probably be safe enough on your own --
You'll probably be safe enough on your own --
I doubt it.
I doubt it.
Maybe -- it's hard to say.
It's okay to call them brontosaurs, Tim. It's a great name. It's a romantic name. It means "thunder lizard".
"Thunder lizard!"
Straight-A brainiac!
Could you guys possibly cool that for a - -
What do you call a blind dinosaur?

Take a bite, take a bite. I'm not letting go.
It's so strong! Look at its nose. Need help?
Come on, try some. Take a bite.
It's good protein. Come on, Lex. Why don't you touch it? Look at his nose.
It's good protein. Come on, Lex. Why don't you touch it? Look at his nose.
This is a seventy-seven ton animal. Come on over, Lex! Just think of it as a big cow. Look at it's teeth? Come here, girl. This is a seventy-seven ton animal. Just think of it as a big cow!
You know what this is? It's a dinosaur egg. The dinosaurs are breeding.
But - - my grandpa said all the dinosaurs were girls.

Amphibian DNA.
It's a bit of a climb. You guys think you can make it?
Nope.
I can't! I'm scared!
Tim, you're gonna have to let go. I'm going to count to three.
Go, go, go, jump!
You're crazy! I'm not gonna jump!
You're crazy! I'm not gonna jump!
Tim, you're going to have to let go of the fence. Tim! Get down right now. Get off the fence! Now!
Are you crazy? What if you miss? I hate it up here.
Tim, I'm right here. Easy catch. Easy catch. Count to Three..
So you two dig up dinosaurs?
Try to!
Cloning from What?! Loy extraction has never recreated an intact DNA strand!
Not without massive sequence gaps!
to Grant) She's, uh - - tenacious.
You have no idea.
You have no idea.
to Ellie) You will remember to wash your hands before you eat anything?
You got any kids?
Me? Oh, hell yes. Three. I love 'em. I love kids. Anything at all can and does happen.
You're married?
Occasionally. Always on the lookout for the future ex- Mrs. Malcolm.
By the way, Dr. Sattler - she's not like, uh, available, is she? - -
Why?
Why?
Why? Oh, I'm sorry. Are you two, uh - - are? I wish you the best luck.
What'd I touch?!
You haven't touched didn't touch anything. We're stopping. We've stopped.
You haven't touched didn't touch anything. We're stopping. We've stopped.

No.
Their radio's out too. Gennaro said to stay put.
The kids okay?

Well, I didn't ask. Why wouldn't they be?

What's to be scared about? It's just a little hiccup in the power.

Fine.
Where does he think he's going?
When you gotta go, you gotta go.
Keep absolutely still - - it's vision's based on movement!
You're sure?!
You're sure?!
Relatively.
Oh my God!
We gotta do something.
We gotta do something.
What? What can we do?
What? What can we do?
There's gotta be something - -
Hey, we were saving that!
For today, I guarantee it.
For today, I guarantee it.
And who in God's name do you think you are....?
And who in God's name do you think you are....?
John Hammond. And I am delighted to finally meet you in person Dr Grant.
Not just kids - - for everyone. We're going to open next year. Unless the lawyers kill me first. I don't care for lawyers. You?
I, uh, don't really know any. We - -
I, uh, don't really know any. We - -
Well, I'm afraid I do. There's one, a particular pebble in my shoe. He represents my investors. He says they insist on outside opinions.

What kind of opinions?
What kind of opinions?
Not to put a fine point on it, your kind. Let's face it, in your particular field, you're the top minds. If I could just get you two to sign off on the park - - you know, give a wee testimonial - - I could get back on schedule - - - -schedule.
Well, it's - - right up your alley. Look, why don't you both come on down for the weekend. Love to have the opinion of a paleobotoanist as well. I've got a jet standing by at Choteau.
No, I'm sorry, that wouldn't be possible. We've just discovered a new skeleton, and - -

For a further three years.
That thing's got a what, twenty-five, twenty-seven foot neck?
The brachiosaur? Thirty.
- - and you're going to sit there and try to tell me it can push blood up a thirty-foot neck without a four-chambered heart and get around like that?! Like that!? This is like a knockout punch for warm-bloodedness.
We clocked the T-rex at thirty-two miles an hour.
Can't you stop these things?!
Sorry! It's kind of a ride!
Sorry! It's kind of a ride!
Let's get outta here!
Blood temperature feels like high eighties.
Wu?
Robert. Robert Muldoon, my game warden from Kenya. Bit of an alarmist, I'm afraid, But he's dealt with the raptors more than anyone.
Alan Grant. Tell me, what kind of metabolism do they have? What's their growth rate? rate of growth.
Yes, yes, yes, which is why we take extreme precautions. They viewing area below us will have eight-inch tempered glass set in reinforced steel frames to - -
Do they show intelligence? With the brain cavity like theirs we assumed - -
Ah - - they're here.
Who?
You four are going to have a little company out in the park. Spend a little time with our target audience. Maybe they'll help you get the spirit of this place.
What does he mean by "target audience"?
Mr. Hammond, I've decided not to endorse your Park.
After careful consideration, Dr. Grant - - so have I.
Tim! Lex!
Dr. Grant! Dr. Grant!
He's knocked out! He's knocked out! Dr. Grant! Dr. Grant! Daddy, daddy!
Let's get you out.
Dad - - Dad - -
Shhh - - I'm right here, Lex. I'm going to look after you. I'm going to help your brother. I want you to stay here and wait for me, okay?
Shhh - - I'm right here, Lex. I'm going to look after you. I'm going to help your brother. I want you to stay here and wait for me, okay?
He left us! He left us!
He left us! He left us!
That's not what I'm going to do. Good!
Liar! You said you wouldn't leave!
I'm trying to use psychology to get you out of the drain, you know!
It's safe?
It's safe.
It's safe.
It's safe.
It's safe.
Go that's the way we're going to go. What do you say?
Go that's the way we're going to go. What do you say?
Alright.
Hear that? Are you hearing this?
No, I didn't hear anything. No, we're okay.
Tim, Tim, Tim....
Oh, I hate the other kind.
Oh, I hate the other kind.
They're just doing what they do. Well the other kind - - - - just do what they do.
They're just doing what they do. Well the other kind - - - - just do what they do.
Dorkatops!
What are you gonna do now if you don't have to dig of dinosaur bones any more?
I guess we'll just have to evolve too.
What if the dinosaur comes back while we're all asleep?
I'll stay awake.
I'll stay awake.
All night?
All night?
All night.
Go away!
It's okay! It's okay! It's a brachiosaur!
I like cows.
You're a beautiful big animal.
What's that?
Well, on the tour - - the film said they used frog DNA to fill in the gene sequence gaps. They mutated the dinosaur's genetic code and blended it with that of frogs. Now, some West African frogs have been known to spontaneously change sex from male to female, in a single sex environment. Malcolm was right! Look, life found a way!
Watch how it eats!
Please!
Please!
Bet you'll never look at birds the same way again!
Let's go!
Okay. Keep low. Follow me.
C'mon Tim, move down, damn it!
Timmy! The power is coming down, quick!
Do as he says! The power's coming back, Timmy!
Timmy, let go! You're gonna have to let go! Count to three. I'll catch you.
Timmy, let go! You're gonna have to let go! Count to three. I'll catch you.
Timmy! Do as he says! Timmy! Do as Dr. Grant says, quick!
Shhhh. Tim, I'm right here below you. Easy catch. One, two, three. You count it yourself. One, two, three - -
You're gonna get electrocuted electrified!
You're gonna get electrocuted electrified!
It's am easy catch, you let - - go - - you do the counting, you count it, Tim. One, two, three -- you do all the counting, okay?
It's am easy catch, you let - - go - - you do the counting, you count it, Tim. One, two, three -- you do all the counting, okay?
Timmy, listen to Dr. Grant!
Timmy, listen to Dr. Grant!
I'm coming up there Tim! I'm coming to get you! Lex, I've got to get him!
I am gonna have to find the others and get you to a doctor. Will you look after Tim, Lex?
Yes.
What works?
Phone security systems, everything works. You ask for it, we got it!
You'll have to get use to Dr. Malcolm! He suffers from a deplorable excess of personality, especially for a mathematician!
Chaotician, actually! Chaotician!
John doesn't subscribe to Chaos, particularly what it has to say about his little science project!
Codswollop! Ian, you've never come close to explaining these concerns of yours about this island!
Codswollop! Ian, you've never come close to explaining these concerns of yours about this island!
I certainly have! Very clearly! Because of the behavior of the system in phase space!
A load, if I may say so. of fashionable number crunching, that¹s all it is!
John, John.
John, John.
Don't do that!
Don't do that!
Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler -- you've heard of Chaos Theory?
Your silence intrigues me.
John, the kind of control you're attempting is not possible. If there's one thing the history of evolution has taught us, it's that life will not be contained. Life breaks free. It expands to new territories. It crashes through barriers. Painfully, maybe even.. dangerously, but and...well, there it is.
Alright Donald, alright, but just let him talk. I want to hear all viewpoints. I truly do. I truly am.
Don't you see the danger, John, inherent in what you're doing here? Genetic power is the most awesome force ever seen on this planet. But you wield it like a kid who's found his dad's gun.
You don't give us our due credit. Our scientists have done things no one could ever do before.
Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn't stop to think if they should. Science can create pesticides, but it can't tell us not to use them. Science can make a nuclear reactor, but it can't tell us not to build it!

But this is nature! Why not give an extinct species a second chance?! I mean, Condors. Condors are on the verge of extinction - - if I'd created a flock of them on the island, you wouldn't be saying any of this! have anything to say at all!

Hold on - - this is no species that was obliterated by deforestation or the building of a dam. Dinosaurs had their shot. Nature selected them for extinction.

I don't understand this Luddite attitude, especially from a scientist. How could we stand in the light of discovery and not act?
I don't understand this Luddite attitude, especially from a scientist. How could we stand in the light of discovery and not act?
There's nothing that great about discovery. What's so great about discovery? It's a violent, penetrative act that scars what it explores. What you call discovery I call the rape of the natural world!
I think perhaps I'll just sit down. I don't suppose you think all that much of me now, do you?
You're all right, John You're okay. It's just you don't have intelligence. You have "thinktelligence." You think narrowly and call it "being focused." You don't see the consequences. You're very good at solving problems, at getting answers - - but you just don't know the right questions.
That will teach you to trust Grandpa.
Wait a minute? What do you mean "worked"? Everything is still off!
I am totally unappreciated in my time. We can run the whole park from this room, with minimal staff, for up to three days. You think that kind of automation is easy? Or cheap? You know anybody who can network eight Connection Machines and de-bug two million lines of code for what I bid this job? Because I'd sure as hell like to see
I'm sorry about your financial problems. I really am. But they are your problems.

Well?
There's no sign of him anywhere.
Robert - - I wonder if perhaps you would be kind good enough to take a gas jeep and bring back my grandchildren.
Sure.
We miss you.
Thanks for the presents.
Thanks for the presents.
We love the presents.
What's going to happen to the goat? He's going to eat the goat?!
Excellent.
I'm sorry - - I'm sorry - -
Turn it off, Lex! Turn it off!
I don't know, I don't know. I'm sorry - -
Why did you do this?
Why did you do this?
I don't know! I'm sorry!
Why are we hurrying if there's nothing wrong?
What if we fall? I hate trees.
I hate trees!
They don't bother me.
They don't bother me.
Yeah, you weren't in that last one.
No, no, sh, sh, sh - - stop! Stop! Stop! Don't let the monsters come over here!
They're not monsters, Lex. They're just animals. And these are herbivores.

Hey Lex, you forgot to say gazundheit.
That's not funny.
That was great!

Really? How much?
Fifty.
Fifty? We need seventy-five.

Ken, we've been through this...
You tell them if they come up to seventy-five, I'll cut them in on the Crystal Lake package.
Don't tell me you're still thinking of buying Casa de Psycho...

Hey, smart-ass, I'm up here right now in a... luxury alpine retreat, with a two million dollar view of the lake.
Chain saws.
You want to put in chain saws?
You want to put in chain saws?
No, no... listen, when I get back to New York we'll meet with the Board.
I don't think the people who live around here would like that very much...
Do you think they like the fact that tourism has dropped ninety-eight percent in the last ten years?

That's not true...
That's not true...
We're not talking about truth, we're talking about perception. And the perception is that Crystal Lake means inbred psychopaths running around the hills with axes and hockey masks chopping up teenagers. That, my dear, is what we call an _image problem_.
Beautiful trees... sturdy trunks... lots of branches... We can do some great logging up here.
Logging? We'll need an environmental impact study for that...

I think we're lost.

You have a map.
You have a map.
I know... but we left the main trail... and I can't find any landmarks around here... I've been trying to figure it out but...
I didn't think there were any houses up here...
You learn something new every day. Let's go.
Structure might be salvageable... let's see what the interior looks like.

There doesn't seem to be any water damage. Kind of cozy, actually.
I really think we should go back...

I want to look at the rest of the house.

Where's Ken? Is he all right?
I don't know...
What about that other guy?

Other guy?
Other guy?
Yeah. Ken said there was another guy there... _big_ guy... then he dropped the phone. What's going on?
Janet, are you okay? Are you there?
He... he's here...
He... he's here...
Who's there?
Oh my god... this is his house... _we're in his fucking house_...
Janet, goddamnit, what's going on?
Janet, goddamnit, what's going on?
Jas... Jason Voorhees... he's here...
Two.
I'm not sure I'd call them murder exactly. More like a couple of bar fights that got out of hand.

I seem to recall arguing the same thing in court while you were trying to file murder-one charges.

That's my job.
Quite a circus.
And we're in the center ring. You sure you want to wear that blazer?
What?
You're about to be a media darling -- you might want to dress the part.
Ruby, come on. You witnessed a brutal triple murder and you're having trouble accepting it. Think about what you're saying. You really expect a jury to believe that Jason has a mystery killer living in his tummy?
I know how this sounds, but that's what happened.
I can't wait to hear your opening argument. "Ladies and Gentlemen of the Jury... the Defense will prove that Jason Voorhees did not kill all of these people. They, in fact, committed mass suicide and then buried themselves in his back yard..."
Fuck you.
What's going on?
Some kind of emergency back at the Sheriff's Station. Four deputies shot... some kind of explosion... I don't know what's going on, but they're panicking back there.
It's still on.
What?
What?
His camera... it's still recording.
What happened?
_Krueger_...
_Krueger_...
Who?
Who?
Come on.
Three. Where's my client?
Your... client is being booked right now. He'll be in cell five.

What are the charges?
What are the charges?
Shit. We're still putting the victim list together. You'll need a forklift for the case file. I suggest you hire some help, and don't expect to get a lot of sleep for the next few months. You're about to defend the most notorious serial killer in American history.

I thought that was Ted Bundy.
I thought that was Ted Bundy.
Compared to this guy... amateur.
A house?
That's right. Wasn't on any of the maps... we could barely see it through the underbrush. Place must've been abandoned for twenty years.
Ruby... this guy almost took out an entire Tactical Response Team. You can't expect me to just leave you --
He doesn't look like he's going anywhere, Bill. And if necessary, I can get a judicial order reaffirming the right of my client to speak to his attorney in private.
That's right... it... it came right out of his chest...
Who's chest?
Who's chest?
Jason's. It came out of his chest... a hand with long blades on the fingers...
And this hand... it... it slashed Doctor Layton's throat... and the Deputy. Then it grabbed Danny by the head... And it pulled his head right down into his chest... I couldn't... Hayes lays a hand his shoulder.
Take it easy, Ruby... it's all right. Now, try to think clearly... don't you mean _Jason's_ hand... don't you mean he grabbed a scalpel and slashed Doctor Layton's throat?
Take it easy, Ruby... it's all right. Now, try to think clearly... don't you mean _Jason's_ hand... don't you mean he grabbed a scalpel and slashed Doctor Layton's throat?
Did you find a scalpel? Did you find a murder weapon?
Are you going to plead insanity?
I think it's our best bet. They're taking apart his house right now... they found weapons, blood, a mountain of evidence. We can't say he was framed.
Sorry.
It's all right. Now... we're going to need a really good head-doctor for this. Someone who can get up on the stand and tell the jury that our client is mentally insane and has been for years... We'll go through a dozen doctors before we find one who's willing to testify for us.
Now... I think the video store's open for another couple of hours. Let's go.
Video store?
So... why can't Jason get a fair trial?
Because everyone knows he's guilty...
Because everyone knows he's guilty...
Wrong. Jason can't get a fair trial because of _these_.
You think that's going to work?
I don't know if anything's going to work in this case. Therefore, we have to try everything.
You watch this garbage?
This is a legitimate cinematic genre. Just like Westerns, Comedies, Film Noire, Science Fiction...
"Zombie Sluts From Beyond the Grave."
A seminal film. First ever depiction of a fully nude triple impalement.
Well?
He's fucking nuts.
He's fucking nuts.
Great. Is that what you're going to say when I put you on the stand?
Great. Is that what you're going to say when I put you on the stand?
No. When you put me on the stand, I'll say your client is catatonic and exhibits classic symptoms of a schizophrenic, sociopathic personality. And he doesn't sleep.
No. When you put me on the stand, I'll say your client is catatonic and exhibits classic symptoms of a schizophrenic, sociopathic personality. And he doesn't sleep.
Doesnit sleep?

Insomnia. Not unusual for someone in his situation. Not to mention he's a bed-wetter.

He wets the bed?

I always throw that in. It makes the jury feel sorry for the defendant.
Oh?
One of the deputies is pretty cute. I think she likes me.
This is bad, Joe. The Prosecution is already putting together a team of psychiatric specialists. They'll argue exactly the opposite. They'll say he's just pretending to be catatonic and he's completely sane.
Great. Battling head doctors. We'll confuse the jury enough to create a reasonable doubt. Hung jury.
Great. Battling head doctors. We'll confuse the jury enough to create a reasonable doubt. Hung jury.
This is Jason Voorhees. They'll be looking for an excuse to send him to the chair. If we're going to argue insanity, we're going to need something a little more concrete.
Nurses. That's why I went into medicine.
This sexual obsession of yours. Have you considered going into therapy yourself?

No need. I'm self-diagnosed. I have severe nympholepsy... And I'm a bed-wetter.
No need. I'm self-diagnosed. I have severe nympholepsy... And I'm a bed-wetter.
Well, I definitely feel sorry for you. August fourteenth, 1956... Jason was brought in by his mother, who said the boy hadn't slept for two weeks. Doctor prescribed Valium...
I don't believe it. Jason's mother died of ovarian cancer in 1969.
So?
So?
I thought she was a killer, too. You know... that she chopped up a bunch of teenage camp counselors... before she was decapitated.
That's the problem with this case. Everyone thinks they know Jason's life story. But they don't. What you're remembering is a _movie_. Fiction. In the movie, Jason's mother runs around, killing people after Jason drowns in Crystal Lake
None of that's true?
None of that's true?
Well, Jason _was_ in a canoe accident in 1967 and presumed drowned. His mother died a few years later after a long bout with cancer. Some time in the early eighties, there were a string of murders out by Crystal Lake... People started saying it was Jason... back from the dead.

So, what are you saying... that he didn't kill all those people?
So, what are you saying... that he didn't kill all those people?
My job is not to determine his guilt or innocence. That's up to the jury. My job is defend him.
Don't get me wrong. I don't care. But the professional part of me is interested in how you rationalize what you do.
I don't "rationalize" anything. I'm his lawyer -- he's my client. That's all.
I don't "rationalize" anything. I'm his lawyer -- he's my client. That's all.
That didn't sound very convincing.
What do you want -- a tidy psychological profile? You want to hear that I was falsely accused of a crime I didn't commit... and that's driven me to defend others? Or maybe you want to me to get in touch with my feelings... talk about my childhood...
No. You've told me all I need to know.
No. You've told me all I need to know.
Oh?
Oh?
You're obviously going through a critical moral dilemma. And you're putting up barriers against anyone who tries to probe your conscience. But it is heartening to know that you do have a conscience.
Not much here. Jason was brought in a couple more times for insomnia... that's about it.
Wait a minute. Let me see that. She hands him the file.
Wait a minute. Let me see that. She hands him the file.
The mother said the boy hadn't slept for over three _months_. A physical examination showed dilated pupils, temperature of one-oh-two, blood chemistry highly imbalanced...

That's pretty weird. Is it possible for someone to not sleep for months?
That's pretty weird. Is it possible for someone to not sleep for months?
It's rare... but there are cases where people go for years without sleep. They diagnosed Jason with simple insomnia... but that's not what it looks like to me. He has every indication of having _insomnolesence_.

Insomnolesence...
Insomnolesence...
It's a neurological disorder affecting the hypothalamus. The part of the brain that causes sleepiness is inactive. They didn't know about it back in the sixties. Even now, it's not understood very well.
So Jason doesn't sleep... how does that help us?
Insomnolesence has been known to cause psychotic episodes... delusions...

If we could prove that Jason suffers from this disorder... and that his homicidal behavior has been a direct result of a medical condition...

Not guilty by reason of insanity. Case closed.
Not guilty by reason of insanity. Case closed.
How do we prove it?
How do we prove it?
Simple. We sedate him, induce a somnolesent state, and study his REM patterns when he's unconscious. If he has the disorder, his REMS will be highly abnormal. Ruby smiles.

Then I'd say it's bedtime for Jason.
How long will he need to be asleep?
We're going to need at least two full REM cycles to get a clear neurological profile. Three hours minimum, six hours ideal.
Well, that's it. He'll be asleep in a few minutes, but his first REM-cycle probably won't kick in for another hour or so. Is there a place we can get something to eat in this town?
There's a pizza place over on Market.
There's a pizza place over on Market.
Cute waitresses?
Cute waitresses?
That's open to debate.
That's open to debate.
I'll take my chances. Come on, I'm buying.
There's nothing to see here. He sleeps... we record it. That's all that happens.
He's my client, and this is important. Enjoy your waitresses.
I think I'm onto something, Joe.
Me too. I'm drunk.
Me too. I'm drunk.
Well, I'm onto something more useful. You ever hear of a man named Fred Krueger?
Krueger... doesn't ring a bell.
He was a child killer in the late sixties... in a town called Springwood about eight miles from here. Guess what his murder weapon was? A glove with six-inch blades.
He was a child killer in the late sixties... in a town called Springwood about eight miles from here. Guess what his murder weapon was? A glove with six-inch blades.
Fascinating.
Fascinating.
Now.... according to the file, Krueger was burned to death in a fire in 1968. But get this -- beginning in 1984, there was _another_ series of murders in Springwood. All teenagers... all killed in their sleep... all killed with finger blades just like Krueger's.
I thought you said Krueger burned to death.
That's right. The murders in the eighties were never solved. But... there were teenaged witnesses who said Krueger had the ability to appear in your dreams... and that if he killed you in a dream, it would kill you in the real world.
That's right. The murders in the eighties were never solved. But... there were teenaged witnesses who said Krueger had the ability to appear in your dreams... and that if he killed you in a dream, it would kill you in the real world.
Uh-huh...
Uh-huh...
Don't you see? Jason was _asleep_. And he was dreaming -- the REM patterns prove that. And I saw finger blades just like Krueger's come out of Jason's chest. There has to be a connection.

Yeah... I think I understand... You're drunk, too.
See this?
Yeah, what is it?
Yeah, what is it?
_It's a second REM pattern_.
It's as though there were two people in that room... both of them asleep... both of them dreaming.
That doesn't make sense.
That doesn't make sense.
Add it to the list.
Add it to the list.
So what do we do?
I don't suppose I can go back to the University and chase young coeds again... pretend this whole thing never happened...
Not yet.
Not yet.
Then I'd say we should put Jason under again... run another tape on him and see what happens. We'll get extra data this time. Video... infrared... the works.

Great. When can you do it?

Tomorrow. If you can clear it with the Sheriff's department.
Tomorrow. If you can clear it with the Sheriff's department.
I'll have to lean on them pretty hard after what happened last night... but I think I can do it. Let me know what happens.
I'll have to lean on them pretty hard after what happened last night... but I think I can do it. Let me know what happens.
You're not going to be there?
You're not going to be there?
I was there once... that was enough. Besides... I have to go out to Jason's house tomorrow. They're... digging up some new evidence.
It's all right. I'm simply in shock... this is what happens to people when they experience events they can't understand or comprehend. The mind shuts down temporarily and tries to shield itself from the horrific imagery it's been exposed to. I'm going to need a lot of therapy.
It was Krueger, wasn't it?
You saw him?
A cameraman caught him on videotape. Joe, I saw an entire sheriff's squad fighting and losing against an enemy that wasn't there...
What are you doing?
Checking out a theory. Just keep talking to him.
This is Jason's REM pattern... and this is the boy's REM pattern. They're identical.
How's that possible?
How's that possible?
Jason's asleep... maybe he's dreaming of himself as a young boy... and that boy is sitting right here. I think he's some kind of projection from Jason's subconscious.
So Krueger thinks Jason's dead... leaves him in the lake... but the boy actually wakes up on the shore... crawls off into the woods... where he lives the rest of his life alone.
Alone... but with a murderous fury inside him... which led him to kill dozens of people.
If I'm right, this happened before the Krueger murders in Springwood. That means that Jason might've been Krueger's first victim.
Except this victim got away. I wonder if --
Where's he going?
I don't know... but I think he's pissed.
I don't know... but I think he's pissed.
Great. Now there's _two_ serial killers on the loose.
Great. Now there's _two_ serial killers on the loose.
Krueger's the greater danger right now. We have to stop him. _Springwood_. That's where he'll go. That's where he's always gone. But Springwood's not like Crystal Lake. There's a couple hundred thousand people there. He could be anywhere.
You know how to use one of those?
I used to go hunting with my father when I was a kid.
I used to go hunting with my father when I was a kid.
Think it'll do any good?
Krueger's in the real world... maybe he's mortal, like us.
And if he's not?
And if he's not?
Then we're all in a lot of trouble.
What's that?
_Neurolar_. It's a stimulant -- it's also a serotonin inhibitor. It suppresses all electrical activity in the hippocampus... the part of the brain that controls dreaming.

So you think it might counteract Krueger's ability to make us hallucinate?

About ten minutes.
About ten minutes.

Ten minutes...
If I give you a bigger dose, it'll give you a heart attack.
We're down to seven minutes.
Let's split up. You take the left side, I'll take the right. We'll meet in front of the Cineplex.
Are you all right?
For the moment! You've only got about two minutes left! Hurry! Ruby takes off towards the Cineplex...
What happened? Where's Jason?
My client... is dead. But I think he's a free man.
-- I'm hoping to live in the Old Quarter.
Even the so-called New Town isn't so new. Only the people. People of the future living in buildings of the past. Has anyone seen Eduard?
You work in the insurance department?
You have been hearing the sordid side then.
Where do you live?
Up there.
It's only majestic from here. When you get closer you see it for what it really is.
What is it really?
What is it really?
A glorified office block. They keep all the old records there -- the final resting place for facts and figures that have ceased to matter in the world of the living.

Preliminary investigations may already be underway.
You were his friend. One link is all they need.
-- Merely in the interests of order.
The formality of a trial would be too costly for them. They're beginning to understand that it's the ensuing news of our actions that incites support.
-- Ah, but what if it <u>wasn't</u>?
-- Small.
Yours is a very powerful and important firm -- it has a lot at stake.
Perhaps Eduard was closer than he knew to discovering it and so had to be silenced.

A cenotaph -- a monument to someone whose remains ended up elsewhere. But look --
The Castle gates were blockaded in the time of the great plague -- it's an escape route. Don't get stuck.

No, I don't. I'm amazed that anyone is able to bear life with any assurance at all.

The day he died, Eduard was called up to the Castle. Did you know that?
What of it?

He was summoned to help correct a minor discrepancy of some sort in the Medical Records Division. Apparently one of his claims was relevant.

At the cost of others? You accuse people of murder without trial -- apparently without irony. Did you go to the Castle with Eduard? Then you have no idea what really might have happened that night at all -- even before or after he got there.
I'm collecting Eduard's things. If there's anything you want, take it or I'll give it to charity.

You might think -- I thought so myself at first -- that Burgel's too insignificant to be dangerous. But that's the very reason to beware! It's the small men to watch out for -- the ones who substitute method for character.
Now you've fallen into his trap. When he goes to bed at night Burgel dreams of inspiring as much fear in others as they inspire in him.

That's obvious, isn't it? We have an opening for a new member.
That's <u>mad</u>.

A mere slip. Your friend Mr. Raban dealt only with claims that came <u>in</u>, another department being responsible for compensation that goes out -- this is correct?

It only amuses me in that it gives me an insight into the ludicrous bungling that in some circumstances may decide the life of a human being.
-- If an obscure official up there in the distant mountains so far away from civilizing influences happens to meet with an unfortunate accident -- and should he tragically die in spite of the District Medical Officer's strenuous efforts to save him -- the firm wants to see the next of kin pacified and the disposition of the remains handled with the greatest possible

He can't sit still. Just when we arrive at a nightclub he wants to go to another one.
You look tired.

Gabriela Rossman was here looking for you. Do you know her?
Women are all you have on your mind!
She went to the roof to sunbathe one lunch hour -- we watched her changing.
They keep switching us from department to department. He doesn't mind because he can't sit still.
We used to be in the supply section, carrying boxes of medicine about but we dropped too many of them.

It's not our fault. We're naturally nervous.
And we're upset too.
We've been together too long. His personality is overflowing into mine and vice versa.
-- How would <u>you</u> like to be in a horrible situation like that?
But your goal is so hard to reach. Do you think the official network would surrender to one man? We would never think of attempting anything remotely as difficult.
My mother used to tell us of the young man who decided to ride to the next village and how she was afraid that -- not even mentioning accidents -- the span of a normal happy life might fall far short of the time needed for such a trip.
Oskar!
Ludwig?
This is filed incorrectly!
Here too! They're all in a dreadful muddle!
We could go back to the office. Explain ourselves to the Chief Clerk.

Hi - Carl Denham. I'm A big admirer of your work, sir. I've loved all your discoveries. I really want to work closely with you on this incredible find. It'll be good for you and good for me.
Look Mr Denham - you're not welcome here. Just pack up your cameras and go.
I'm coming onboard! Throw down a ladder!
You're outta your depth here, Miss Darrow!
You're outta your depth here, Miss Darrow!
There's no hard feelings, Mr Denham! I just want to come to the island with you!
There's no hard feelings, Mr Denham! I just want to come to the island with you!
Does this look like the "Queen Mary"?? We don't take passengers! Full steam ahead, Captain Engelhorn!
Can I see the map? My father spoke of references to a Beast God ...
Kong is a myth, nothing but a native superstition, Miss Darrow. All we're going to find on that island are some primitive people in grass skirts. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm trying to reduce my handicap.
I hope it fits ... Mrs Denham's a big lady.
It's ... lovely.
It's ... lovely.
Miss Darrow ... I've been thinking. I would very much like to dedicate this motion picture to the memory of your father. It's a great shame he wasn't able to join us on this adventure. Truly a wonderful man.
I thought that with your assistance we could have the premiere at the Albert Hall. We'll take out a full page ad in Variety - "The Lord Darrow Benefit screening". We'll invite the King of England - hell, we'll get the whole Royal Family along! It'd be good for them and good for us!
To be quite honest, Mr Denham ... I find the whole idea to be quite reprehensible.
Am actually laying my hand on the twenty-five foot gorilla.Ladies and gentlemen! I am touching the beast!
Take your filthy paws off him -you ignorant pig!
Get the hell out of here.''!
Now Ann ...
What have you got there?
A Neolithic bronze ... Reminiscent of the Nias Island cultures ... It ' s very curious. Defiantly Pagan. The use of ivory for the spear is quite unique ... What do you think?

I think you're trying to run before you can walk, Ann.
Now look at this fine example of early Hindu art ... I don't recall any sketches of this passing across my desk ...
I photographed it extensively, father.
I photographed it extensively, father.
Photography teaches you nothing, Ann! Click! One second and you've seen all you're going to see. I want you sitting here with your paper and pencils ... I want to see every chisel mark reproduced with painstaking accuracy. Understand the carving and you will understand the people! That Ann, is the key to archaeology.
Father!
These are priceless artifacts! They're ruining the site!
Out! Out! All of you! We have been issued with an exclusive permit -
Father ... Father!
Father It's somewhere south-west of here - we need to inform the museum ... · organize an expedition -
All in due course, Ann. Our first responsibility is to get these artifacts safely back to London.
Oh God, it's that bloody yank!
Now now, Ann! Try be to polite.
He's grubbing for money, father.
I just wanna deal with the boss, ok?

You - calling me a thief? Well, that's great, coming from a glorified grave robber! You break into the tomb of some dead Egyptian - the poor guy's happily enjoying the afterlife when suddenly his shit gets stolen by a bunch of light fingered limeys!

Tell me, Mr Driscoll - is it a requirement of the forestry business that you have to be as thick as the trees you cut down?
Holy God! The mummy walks!
How dare you? My father is the British Museum's most respected archeologist!
How dare you? My father is the British Museum's most respected archeologist!

God, you're so obnoxious! Our work happens to be of great anthropological value!
Value? ... Value?
I'm sorry ...
No!
Where do I charter a boat?
There's nothing fast enough to catch that. Forget it. It's over.
There's nothing fast enough to catch that. Forget it. It's over.
I not doing this for me, Jack! It's for my father. This is possibly the greatest anthropological discovery of the last two hundred years! It belongs to him! I'm going to that island ... nothing's going to stop me!
Can you fly?
Are you kidding?! That heap of junk will never leave the ground!
Yeah! Life's looking pretty damn good at the moment.
I don't know what happened to you, Jack ... but I can't believe you were always this much of a bastard.
I don't know what happened to you, Jack ... but I can't believe you were always this much of a bastard.
When this boat finally reaches Jakata, I'll be first off. You'll never see me again ... and believe me - that day cannot come soon enough. I've got no problem with you ignoring me for the rest of the voyage.
I want to thank you.
It's ok.I know what you were feeling.

Relax ... it was fifteen years ago. I don't do it now.
There's a light up ahead.
Sun's coming up ... We've been in the fog for six hours.
It's the same image - Kong!
Leave it, Ann.
Jack!
We're leaving.
We're leaving.
But . . . we can' t Jack, I need time to collect artifacts ... make sketches ... gather evidential information.

Oh Jesus ... you took it.
Jack! This is the archeological find of the century!

This shit is bad luck! Don't you understand? You treat it like a game - two men have already died!
Give it back!
I'm not sailing with this thing on board!
I'm not sailing with this thing on board!
No! Don't!

It' s alright Jack ... it' s alright.
Look, I've sailed these waters for twenty-seven years ... there's no island like that around here.
What a climax to the film - The first white men to set foot on ... "Skull Island" Twentieth Century man comes face to face with a ... a ... naked stone age tribe!

We need those co-ordinates -someone's gotta get back there and jot the rest of it down
There's no island there. We're wasting our time!
I'm chartering this vessel,Engelhorn - how many days?
I'm chartering this vessel,Engelhorn - how many days?
Two... maybe three.
I guess that answers your questions. There's no island on these co- ordinates - not even a lousy fog-bank.
Well, that was a monumental waste of time! I pay good money, only to be taken on some wild goose chase! I made the mistake of trusting my idiot translator!
They're stoking the boilers. As soon as we've got some steam, we're outta here.
We should never have come! I pay you good money, only to have my life endangered. You'll be hearing from my lawyer!
Just take it easy .-- Where are the others?
They' re dead.
They' re dead.
Oh my God ... Ann?
Pleased to meet you ... Hi, bow's it going? Pleased to meet you! Hi, Carl Denham ... How's it going?
We offer ourselves at your service, Mr Denham!
We offer ourselves at your service, Mr Denham!
And I appreciate that so much, I really do - a sentiment that will be shared by audiences across America when they view my latest documentary sensation "Indonesia ...Hell Hole of the World". Ernie Hemmingway's agreed to write the narration. We're going out through Universal ... Laemmale's promised me fifteen hundred screens.
You are most kind. We will be proud to assist you!
Exotic lands, primitive people, dangerous animals ... That's what the public expect from a Carl Denham picture! Lead us into the mountains, Sir!

Tell me Mr Ginting - are there any parts of your country where people still wear ... native costume?
Native costume?
Native costume?
Y'know ... traditional ceremonies where the woman ... divest themselves of their undergarments.
We are a very modest and deeply religious people, Mr Denham.
That's too bad.
Man Eater!!!

Did you see her?
Yeah, I saw her ... she was carried into the jungle by ... an animal.
Yeah, I saw her ... she was carried into the jungle by ... an animal.
What was it, Jack?

An ape ... some kind of ape.
Listen buddy! Cut the crap! We're looking for Ann, not making a Goddamn movie!
Jack ... You get to save the girl and I get my third act! It's gonna be good for you and good for me!
Jack ... You get to save the girl and I get my third act! It's gonna be good for you and good for me!
You better not slow us down, Denham!
Holy shit! Look at the size of that!
That's your monkey, Denham.
That's your monkey, Denham.
Kong ...
Hey! I thought these things were supposed to be extinct!
) They are now.
They were just tasting the berries.
Yeah? ... Well, I gave 'em a taste of American lead ... and I don't see 'em coming back for seconds!
Set up the camera boys! Get a shot of me comin' ashore!
Forget it, Denham ... for Godssake
I'm calling a wrap. We're heading back to the ship.
What?
What?
The girl's dead, Driscoll. There's no point continuing on.
Denham! Go back to the wall ... Tell'em to give me twelve hours to get back with Ann!
I can't get back to the wall! I'll get eaten!
Not me. Thought I'd head out west ... get into some Redwood country.
How about Ann? Is she going with you?
Haven't seen her - not since we got back.
She's got a bit of an attitude, that girl. She's turned down a bunch of money. Too bad ... it would've been a great angle - "Beauty and the Beast". I must be getting old - I thought you two had something going there.
Are you nervous Jack?
Nab- Let's get it over with.
Did you fear for your life?
Yeah.
It must have been terrifying?
Yeah.
Are you gonna start it up?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Why?
Why?
Coz of something I lost.

Well she's not now. I did everything for Arlyn. I loved Arlyn I took her right into my apartment, my own sweet apartment on First. But she wouldn't stay off it -- the junk -- and I wept and I pleaded and I held her in my arms - and she started taking things, my things, and selling them for horse. My clothes. We

And then one night -- at the gaming tables -- well I just saw him. A stranger -- looking at me -- and I knew suddenly that all my life I'd been --
-- May I? It's so --
Please --
Not young; he wasn't young -- gray at the temples, he -- well actually he looked like you.
Yes?
Yes?
And nobody could tell me who he was -- an exiled prince or a mercenary or a bullfighter or -- but I felt it stirring inside me, this -- this wild, pagan feeling --
I know: it's ridiculous. But it's tearing me up and I don't know why. And look, all right, I came here didn't I? And if I have to, I'll keep coming here, the works, and talk about my mummy and my daddy and I'll even pay for it, but will you kindly for God's sakes say something?
I'd just be guessing.

You've spent your life avoiding this. You'll try hard to deny it; you're quite likely to destroy it.
All right. Loneliness. Well -- separated. From other people. Forgotten. Well, as if I can be here, I can go through the motions, right? But the truth is, I don't belong.
Don't belong?
Don't belong?
Do you always have to repeat?

The truth is I hate them: they must hate me. All right, the money. All right, not the money. A kind of put-on. It gets things back together.

I said that. Well, so you have a choice. You can either feel lonely -- you know, the hate -- or -- So you take a call and go to a hotel room and there's some John you've never seen before, but he wants you. He must, he's paying for it. And usually they're nervous and that's all right, too, because you're not; you

All right, then, an ordinary matter. I'm a quite well off man, I have a -- position to respect. I would feel personally uncomfortable to be connected with a -- certain kind of woman, I'm sure you understand. Do you? Well I'd like to buy Jane McKenna's book.
You have no idea what I'm talking about.

Then it doesn't matter what I do any more, does it?
I'm not going to hurt you, absolutely, I'm not.
Will you let me go then?
It puzzles me so badly. I've done terrible things but I can't consider myself a terrible man. I've killed three people and I'd still want to say it was accident, do you see?
If you'll let me go I could tell them what --
If you'll let me go I could tell them what --
Tom Grunemann discovered me -- we were here on business together, he discovered me with Jane McKenna. Then I suppose it was the -- the contempt I saw in his face and the certainty that sooner or later he'd use it against me. Within the Company. I endured that as long as I could, do you see?

-- Tuscarora --
All right, yes, I had been. Those sick, wild letters -- I'm watching you, gonna follow you, gonna punish you, kill you et cetera. Well, they said, all right that's Grunemann. So try to remember when you and he - when -- well I don't know, there was that dumper once, he sounded like that dumper -- Dumpers; they get their kicks beating you
You remind me of my uncle.
What? What do you remember about that -- dumper?
What? What do you remember about that -- dumper?
Nothing. Except he wasn't kidding. Usually it's a fakeout, you probably know.

Except this guy was really tripped out on it; he --

You're very square. Pimps don't get you dates, cookie; they just take the money.
I have some names the police gave me. Frank Ligourin. Will you tell me what --
Look, I'm sure this'll amuse you too. Ilia trying to get away from all that.
Look, I'm sure this'll amuse you too. Ilia trying to get away from all that.
What about the old gentleman the other night, Mr. Faber?
Klute, tell me, what's your bag? Are you a talker, or a button man or a doubler, or maybe you like them very young -- children -- or get your chest walked around with high-heeled shoes, or have us watch you tinkle? Or --
-- OK --
-- OK --
-- You want to wear women's clothes, or you get off ripping things --

OK.
Gee I hope this doesn't make my cold any worse.
Tell me about Frank Ligourin.

Mm? Oh, he was my old man. We broke up.
What? This?

No thanks.
You've changed your mind? You do want to play?
I don't want you to look up. There's someone on the skylight.
Tell me about acting -- what are you doing tomorrow -- where do you go?
I go on rounds.

Rounds, what are they? -- don't watch me, keep talking.

He never told me.
He never told me.
Well, let's go down and ask him.
What did you expect? Frankie still has a good string, three girls. Figure three hundred a week from each.
Is that what you gave him?
Did you like my friend Frankie?
No.
No.
Didn't he tell you what you wanted?

It didn't go anywhere. But that's not why --

You told me what you could. I guess I'm through with your part of it.

It's kind of late.
It got lonely upstairs. There's someone on the roof.
Oh, don't be a doo-doo.
Not much point to this, is there?

Ezra, I'm lots better than you're used to. Tell me -- the other night, watching me with Mr. Faber -- wasn't your tongue a little bit hanging out?
Ezra, I'm lots better than you're used to. Tell me -- the other night, watching me with Mr. Faber -- wasn't your tongue a little bit hanging out?
Mm.
Mm.
So you're not too different from him, or the chap on the roof, or Tommy-baby --
Bree -- thanks -- I don't want to.
Oh don't be all hypocrite. Or do you really like other kicks? Is it more just having power over someone? -- so you don't really need to --
What's the matter hon? You were great. Terrific. A tiger.
Thanks.
Thanks.
Well what're you down about? You mean because you didn't get me there? You can't expect that. I mean Frank, yes, he'd get me there all the time -- but never with a John.
You asked if there was anything more you could help me with.
When?
I've checked the records of Jane McKenna's death -- I can't get anything special. But Frank Ligourin had another girl you said, besides McKenna and you.
Arlyn Page.
Arlyn Page.
Did she and Jane McKenna know each other?
Did she and Jane McKenna know each other?
Frankie kept them in the same apartment: it cut his travel-time.

But if it's someone else I do.
I thought you ought to know, Arlyn Page is dead.
How?
How?
The same as Jane McKenna.
The same as Jane McKenna.
Thanks for the jolly news. I thought maybe you'd left town by now. You kind of just disappeared. But you boys from Tuscarora have a habit of disappearing, don't you?
The next few weeks I would like to know where you are all the time.
Why?
Why?
Just let me know when you are going out and where --

I told you before, you wouldn't understand.
I told you before, you wouldn't understand.
You're right, I don't understand. Explain it to me. You were scared. Arlyn Page, that scared you. Well it should; that's death. So what did you do, you ran straight for it, death. Ligourin kills women.

No. Well all right. But you want to and I want you to and we both know it and all right.
No. Well all right. But you want to and I want you to and we both know it and all right.
I don't like getting splashed.
I'm still scared. I mean different but still. Look, I made it very clear from the start, you're a yokel, you don't excite me, you don't even interest me, and so I only have one question which is what the hell are you doing in my bed?
My bed.
I am scared. The things I do. The things I could do to you.
Mm.
Mm.
No, not just 'mm'. You don't know what I --
Oh boy, say, you think you're pretty good.
Yup.
I saw Mr. Faber. You remember Mr. Faber, don't you?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Is that all you have to say?

What am I supposed to say?
What am I supposed to say?
Well, I told him I wouldn't - uh - go there any more. I know it's tough to understand, but it wasn't easy. You see, he was nice to me. I mean, it wasn't just him. I got something out of it too I guess. Anyway, I told him I wouldn't go there anymore.
Spangler says we have a relationship.
What?
What?
You and I -- a relationship.

I was wondering what that was.

Hell there's nothing so mysterious about the square life.
Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus.
Don't touch anything.
Oh look what he did in them.
Drop it.
Listen to me: It's all right. I've been expecting something.

Oh zippidy-doo, they'll find my fingerprints. Can I go in? I need some stuff.
Where'd you spend last night?

Why couldn't you stay here with me?

Because I didn't want to be touched! I didn't think you'd get that!
Hey -- look officer -- I can explain everything. It was just -- you know, everything all of a --
Trask wants to talk with you.
Please. I said I don't want you to do this.
Trask said I should move. Let's not make a thing of it.
I got a call from Ross this morning. Cable owned a plot of woodland -- he'd go there on weekends. They found Tom Grunemann's body buried there. They've notified his wife.
Oh. Well it wasn't us city people that did it -- your fine rosy-cheeked country boy.

Mm.

You're going back?

Well suppose I hadn't come downstairs. Would you just have folded up and sneaked away?
No. I was going to come up. I wanted to ask you to marry me.
No. I was going to come up. I wanted to ask you to marry me.
You wanted to, or you are?
You wanted to, or you are?
I am.
I am.
You could at least look at me!
Look -- yes. I mean thanks, but -- don't you think we better be realistic?
About what?

Look at me. I'm pretty and sort of clever and very well intentioned, and dear God I'd tear your heart out!
Look at me. I'm pretty and sort of clever and very well intentioned, and dear God I'd tear your heart out!
I don't think so.
How can you not think so? You know the things I can do.
They don't scare me any more.
They don't scare me any more.
What?
What?
Doesn't scare me. I think we could handle it.
Look, why should it be yes or no? Can't we keep it going and see? I mean we can keep in touch and visit each other and see. People do that, that's realistic.
OK.
OK.
You don't believe that either, do you? Why can't you see my side?
You don't believe that either, do you? Why can't you see my side?
Can you use these?
Can I carry something for you, to the car? Will you kiss me?
No. I'm sore.
She wouldn't be reliable anyhow -- a narcotics addict.
I believed her, Pete.
All right, suppose it wasn't Tom Grunemann; where does that get you?
It's where it doesn't get me. I've got nothing left that connects to anything.

Then, close the case.

I better keep looking.

I'm flying back out to Pennsylvania Friday; I'll fill them in on things.
How is it back there?
How is it back there?
I think you're homesick. I'll be out at my camp over the weekend. Nice right now, that touch of fall in the air, that skim of frost in the early mornings, very peaceful. John, I'll be back here again Thursday; I'll be in touch. Lieutenant, thank you.
Sorry we had to meet here. But I'm pressed for time.
Well there's a couple --

What?

Call-girls generally keep a book, you know, a list of their clients. Sometimes, if a girl retires, she'll even sell it worth good money. Jane McKenna had a black book; when she died it was stolen. I've been after it a long time.

Would you like to know what's in it? The report.
What's in it?
What's in it?
I think Tom Grunemann's dead. I've been a lot of places - I've asked a lot of people. I've found no proof he's around. I've found no proof he was ever around.
I'm sure the FBI and the Police explored that possibility.
No. They never did, really. But that's what I'm going to recommend. The next step. Unless something --

I've always respected Bree. I'd like to make something clear.
I've just got a few --
I've just got a few --
I'd like to make something clear. I don't go after a girl; a girl comes to me. Her choice. Right?
I'm looking for a man. Tom Grunemann. Bree thinks he may have been the dumper -- that call she had two years ago. She says you sent her on it.
Two years ago? Sorry.
Two years ago? Sorry.
They tell me you use narcotics. Could I bring someone around to look at your arms?
They tell me you use narcotics. Could I bring someone around to look at your arms?
Look -- dad -- I may stand better with the cops than you.
OK, a family matter. Between the girls. I had two other cows -- -- two other girls besides Bree.
She told me.
She told me.
OK and one of them Jane McKenna -- she blows a little jealous of Bree - you know? -- Bree comes first? And evidently she knew the freak --- that he was a dumper -- she conned me into passing him to Bree, you know, so Bree'd get hurt. I didn't know. Till afterwards.

Would I be telling you all this? She copped out long ago. She committed suicide Baxter.
-- Usual case history -- this isn't a medical confidence, it's all of them -- broken family, lonely, confused, crummy childhood, early promiscuity, formal prostitution beginning in her teens, income twenty-five to thirty thousand a year. Oh they don't keep the money: they get rid of it, they get pimps. Why? Why do you want to know all this?
I want to know how Tom Grunemann got mixed up in it.

Not unusual.

Did she talk about him to you?

I think she's trying that.
I think she's trying that.
Oh sure they try. The idea of a better life. But they don't really know much about life: They get confused -- or scared or frustrated or bored -- they pop back to the one thing they can handle. The trick. The trick. Men in bed. Not men in general, not life, not love, not even real sex -- it avoids all that. Just

Did he ever mention specifically a girl or woman in New York?
No.
No.
Examine this letter please. We recovered that from the shredder -- the plant disposal and incinerator system. Grunemann apparently typed it Friday, before he left, decided not to send it, tossed it away. We've already contacted the New York Police; they think they know the girl in question.
But if Cable killed Grunemann why would he get you hired to look for Grunemann?
Because he knew I couldn't leave the case alone. And this way at least he'd keep track of it. And me.
Because he knew I couldn't leave the case alone. And this way at least he'd keep track of it. And me.
What about Grunemann's letters to the girl, everything like that?
Sounds to me you better shake him again. Put him in a spot he has to do something more -- but this time give him a time and a place to do it.
He called this morning from Tuscarora. Asked me to meet him at 3:00 at the downtown heliport. He's on his way to Chicago.
That's a lot of people to die unknown.
Unknown, unidentified and unwanted. And there's more every day man, there's more everyday.
He's right you know. Waiting for the pusher, she'd tell you anything.
I believed her: the Dumper was not Tom Grunemann.
That's how the other one died, you know. In the water.
I looked it up.
Well?
Yeah.
Think this is our guy?
I don't know. It looks familiar to me.
I don't know. It looks familiar to me.
Thought it might. It's off an arrest report you typed two years ago. Man you wanted samples of everybody.
But what reason could he have? What possible reason?

Billy, sometimes when a mother and a father are divorced, there's a discussion about who the child should live with, the mother or the father. Now there is a man who is very wise. He's called a judge. And a judge has a lot of experience with divorces and he decides who it would be best for the child to live with.
Why does he decide?

No, I did not.
No, I did not.
Did you wish to?
Did you wish to?
Yes. I tried to talk to Ted-- my ex-husband--about it, but he wouldn't listen. He refuses to discuss it in any serious way. I remember one time he said I probably couldn't get a job that would pay enough to hire a baby- sitter for Billy.

And yet you chose to leave him?
Yes...Look, during the last five years we were married, I had...I was getting more and more...unhappy, more and more frustrated. I needed to talk to somebody. I needed to find out if it was me, if I was going crazy or what. But every time I turned to Ted--my ex-husband, he couldn't handle it. He became very...I don't know, very threatened. I mean, when-
Your honor, I would like to place in evidence a report on Mrs. Kramer's therapy by her therapist, Dr. Elinore Freedman of La Jolla, California.
Mr. Kramer, why did you set up residence in New York?

Objection.
How long do you plan to live in New York, Mrs. Kramer?

Mrs. Kramer, how can you consider yourself a fit mother when you have been a failure at virtually every relationship you have undertaken as an adult?
Objection!

Your honor, I'd like to ask what this model of stability and respectability has ever succeeded at? Mrs. Kramer, were you a failure at the longest, most important personal relationship in your life?

Can you recall any particular incident that relates to Mr. Kramer's care of his child?
No further questions. Thank you Mrs. Phillips.

Ted was a good worker. But, ah... ... after his wife left him and he was taking care of the kid on his own, things started to change. Look, I know he had problems, I understand that. I've got problems, everybody's got problems. But I've got a shop to run, I can't let that kind of thing get in the way... I guess I

Do you have a lover now?
Is that...permanent?

Then, we don't really know, do we, when you say "permanently" if you're planning to remain in New York, or even to keep the child for that matter, since you've never really done anything in your life that was continuing, stable, that could be regarded as permanent.
Whom you've seen twice in a year? Mrs. Kramer, your ex-husband, wasn't he the longest personal relationship in your life?

Joanna, I don't give a--
Joanna, I don't give a--
Ted, all my life I'd either been somebody's daughter or somebody's wife, or somebody else's mother. Then all of a sudden, I was a thirty-two-year-old, highly neurotic woman who had just walked out on her husband and child. I went to California because that was about as far away as I could get. Only... I guess it wasn't far enough. So I started going

Such as?
Joanna, go be a mother. Get married, have kids. Don't get married, have kids. Do whatever you want. I don't give a damn. Just leave me out of it--and leave my baby out of it.
Ted, if you can't discuss this rationally--
Ted, if you can't discuss this rationally--
Joanna, go fuck yourself!
I'm sorry...I just mentioned it in passing. I never thought he'd use it.
Yeah, well he did, didn't he.
Yeah, well he did, didn't he.
Please, Ted. I never would have brought it up if I thought--
Please, Ted. I never would have brought it up if I thought--
I'm not interested, Joanna. Goodbye.
Okay, I'm here. Now why did you--
Ted, do you love him?
Ted, do you love him?
Goddamnit, Joanna. What the--
Goddamnit, Joanna. What the--
Ted, do you love him?
Ted, when we got married it was because I was twenty-seven years old and I thought I should get married and...when I had Billy it was because I thought I should have a baby...and I guess all I did was mess up my life and your life and--
Joanna, what the hell is--
Joanna, what the hell is--
Please...Please don't stop me. This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do..
After I left...when I was in California, I began to think, what kind of mother was I that I could walk out on my own child. It got to where I couldn't tell anybody about Billy--I couldn't stand that look in their faces when I said he wasn't living with me. Finally it seemed like the most important thing in the world to come
What?
What?
He's already got one mother, he doesn't need two...He's yours... I won't fight you for him any more. He's yours...
He's already got one mother, he doesn't need two...He's yours... I won't fight you for him any more. He's yours...
Oh, God...Oh, my God...
Oh, God...Oh, my God...
Only can I still see him?
Only can I still see him?
No more waiting in Coffee Shops ...I promise.
Okay...I think I'll go talk to my son now. How do I look?
Beautiful.
Ted, will you take it easy? Revlon's not about to drop an account that represents more than two million in gross billing receipts in a small agency like this, without making us sweat. Now just relax, okay? Everything's gonna be fine.
I don't think so, Jim. Maybe I shouldn't have--
Hey, what's the rush? C'mon, walk me a couple of blocks.
Jim, I've got to go. I'm already late--
Jim, I've got to go. I'm already late--
Listen, Ted...I just want to tell you, when old man Schmidt retires next year, I've got a pretty
Wow!
I mean it Ted, you're running this one.
Jesus Christ. That's a real blockbuster. I always figured you guys had it made.
You want to know the real kicker? The real kicker is, for the first time in my life-- the first time--I feel like a loser.
Listen, don't let it get you down. You're going to be fine.
Me? I've never been better. I mean having my wife walk out on me after seven years of marriage agrees with me just fine.
Me? I've never been better. I mean having my wife walk out on me after seven years of marriage agrees with me just fine.
Look, Ted, I'm the oldest whore on the beat, okay? Three marriages, two divorces...You're gonna be okay.
Look, Ted, I'm the oldest whore on the beat, okay? Three marriages, two divorces...You're gonna be okay.
I'm going to be okay. The way I see it, Joanna'll come home, it's just a matter of time.
I'm going to be okay. The way I see it, Joanna'll come home, it's just a matter of time.
She'll be back...
But...just in case...I mean, just on the off chance she doesn't. What are you going to do about the kid?
I don't know, Jim. This whole thing has happened so...Pow-- like that.
I don't know, Jim. This whole thing has happened so...Pow-- like that.
Look, it's none of my business, so you can tell me to butt out, okay? But if you want my advice, you'll send Billy away to stay with relatives for a while. Just until you get yourself straightened out.

I don't know, Jim...
I don't know, Jim...
Ted, this may sound a little rough, but we've just landed the biggest account in the history of this agency, right? And now it's up to us--that's you and me --to deliver the goods. Ted, you're my main man, and if I can't depend on you a hundred and ten percent, twenty-four hours a day, because you're worried about a kid with a runny

Jim, I appreciate what you're saying. I mean it, but I really think Joanna's coming back.
'Night, Jim.
Hey, Ted. C'mon in. I wanna' talk to you.
What the hell is this?
Murray had some ideas about the Fire and Ice campaign and he had the art department make up a few roughs... I think they're kind of interesting.

I don't. Jim, this isn't anything like what we talked about. It's not even close.
All right, Jim. You said I was running this show, right? You said no decisions without my approval, right? Well what the hell is this? What's going on, Jim?
Well, ah...I thought it over and I decided we're doing it Murray's way.
Well, ah...I thought it over and I decided we're doing it Murray's way.
Jim, this is garbage. This isn't anything like what we talked to Revlon about. None of it. You can't--
Jim, this is garbage. This isn't anything like what we talked to Revlon about. None of it. You can't--
That's my decision, Ted and that's final.
Disappointing. It only pulled a fourteen share and they were hoping for a twenty-five minimum, and...ah...they're not very happy and...Well, the guys have decided they want to...ah, re-think the entire concept and...Look, I don't like having to do this, okay?... But...I mean, what I mean is...ah, I'm going to have to...ah, let you go--
Are you firing me, Jim?
Hiya, Phyllis. These are the Revlon contracts. I thought you ought to check them out.
Sure.
Yes.
Yes, what?
Yes, what?
Yes, I'll have dinner with you.
Kramer, I've got to go. I've got an eight o'clock closing tomorrow down on Centre Street.
Mmmmnph...I'll get you a cab...
And?
He wanted to know if I liked fried chicken.
He wanted to know if I liked fried chicken.
Do you?
Okay, Phyllis, what's up?
Kramer...
O'Connor's out to get you. He's going to take the Fire and Ice account away from you.
What?!?
You want to know why? I'll tell you why... Another scotch and soda for the gentleman. I'll tell you exactly why. Because you're not his buddy anymore. Because he can't count on you to sit around the office every night until eight or nine and shoot the shit with him.
I can't. I've got Billy to take care of.
I can't. I've got Billy to take care of.
You dope. O'Connor doesn't give a damn about Billy. All he wants is somebody that'll hang around with him every night so he won't have to go home.
You dope. O'Connor doesn't give a damn about Billy. All he wants is somebody that'll hang around with him every night so he won't have to go home.
I don't believe you.
How should I know?
Murray.
So...what's so terrible about that?
Oh, for God's sake, Kramer. You have got to be the world's most naive human being. Murray has gone in and changed every single ad you've done on the entire Fire and Ice campaign. Every layout...Every idea...Every single thing, right down the line.

No. No, I don't believe it. Jim O'Connor would never let anything like that happen. He gave me my shot in this business. If it wasn't for Jim O'Connor I'd be--I don't know where I'd be. He's a wonderful man...

Kramer, I'm sorry. All I was trying to do was--
I don't want to hear another word against him. Not another word. He's a wonderful man ...a wonderful man...
So, naturally, you assume that since Joanna left, that would be a compelling point against her, right?
Right.
Right.
But it doesn't work that way. A major decision was handed down by the Appellate Court in 1969--in the case of Haskins vs. Haskins.

Now in Haskins vs. Haskins the court ruled in favor of the mother, thus establishing a precedent for awarding the child to the mother even though she previously abandoned the baby.

Fine.
Look, she walked out on her own child, right? That's desertion, right? Mr. Shaunessy, I'm telling you it's an open and shut case.
First, there's no such thing as an open and shut case. Especially where custody is involved. Got it?
That's if we win. If we lose, you could end up having to pay your wife's court costs as well.
Fine.
Fine.
Good. You've hired yourself a hell of a lawyer, Mr. Kramer. How old is the child?
Good. You've hired yourself a hell of a lawyer, Mr. Kramer. How old is the child?
Six.
Look, Ted, I don't honestly think she would go to the trouble of suing you for custody of the child if she was planning on kidnapping him.
I don't know, John...I mean, to be brutally honest, I'm not so sure what kind of mental shape Joanna's in right now. Y'know she admitted she was seeing a shrink.
Jesus Christ. Did you have to be so rough on her?
Do you want the kid or don't you?
Mr. Kramer, would you tell the court exactly why you want to retain custody of your child.
When Joanna-- my ex-wife--when she was talking before about how unhappy she was during our marriage...Well, I guess most of what she said was probably true. There were a lot of things I didn't understand-- a lot of things I would do different if I could. Just like I guess there are a lot of things Joanna wishes she could change...But we can't. Some

Oh, Christ.. .John, there's some- thing I ought to tell you. My... ah, situation has...changed. I lost my job.
John?
Ted, I won't lie to you, we don't have a hope in hell of winning a custody hearing if you're out of work.
Good Christ, Joanna, just get the hell out of my life.

You ever see her talk to the walls?
No, but--
No, but--
Then you don't have a choice. Have Billy at the Seventy- Fifth Street entrance to Central Park, Saturday at ten.

Look, Ted, all I--
Look, Ted, all I--
I came home tonight. We just got the Fire and Ice account at the agency. Do you know what that means?! Do you understand what that means? It means that it was maybe one of the five best days in my whole life.

Yeah, she said it wasn't any use talking anymore.
Yeah, she said it wasn't any use talking anymore.
Ted, don't be so hostile.
Hostile? Me? Thelma, I'm not hostile. I am anything but hostile. But if you want to know what I am. I'll tell you what I am. What I am is, I am hurt. I am very hurt. And I just want to know one thing, okay? Just one thing ...Why? That's all I want to know...Why?

Did it ever occur to you guys that Joanna Kramer's not the easiest person in the world to live with?! Did it?! For one thing she's always thirty minutes late. You can set your watch by it--
Two. She is getting to be a real hermit or recluse or whatever it is you call it. Thelma, do you know where I could be in this business if I had a wife that entertained or went out socially--
Oh for shit's sake, Ted, you are the most selfish human being I have ever met. No wonder she said you came first, then Billy, then, if there was anything left over, she got the scraps.

Joanna said that?
Then how come she never said anything like that to me?
Maybe she didn't feel like she should have to. Maybe she felt like if you'd been paying any real attention to her to start with, maybe you would've noticed.

No.
Y'know something Thelma--you are the typhoid Mary of divorce. I mean it. Joanna and I never had any trouble until you and Charley split up.
Ted, divorce is a terrible thing. I know, I went through it. You've got to believe I did everything I could to get Joanna to stay. But I'll tell you something. You may not want to hear it, but it took a lot of courage for Joanna to do what she just did.

You ever think about getting married again?
No, not really... I guess it's different if you don't have children, but...I dunno, even if Charley and I don't live together, even if we're sleeping with other people, even if Charley was to marry again...He'd still be my husband. That stuff about "Till death do you part?" That's really true.

C'mon, Thel. So Charley had a little fling. So what? All in all he was a pretty good husband.
Look, I know this isn't gonna make any sense, okay? I mean forget the logic part...But I keep thinking if Charley really loved me, he wouldn't have let me divorce him.
Thel, you ever hear from Joanna?
Not for a couple of months. The last time I heard from her she was living in San Francisco.
Not for a couple of months. The last time I heard from her she was living in San Francisco.

Me?! You want me to take care of Billy?!

I thought about it a lot and you're the only person I know that I trust with him. I mean, if anything happened to me, he'd be okay with you. You're a good mother.
You heard anything yet?

Ted, I just heard...
Ted, I just heard...
Please, Thel...
Huh.. .Hello?

Hmmm.
Goodbye, Kundun.
No!
You must also do something about the public meetings. I see this, memorandum circulating, with Tibetan grievances.
You have cracked a man's skull and that crack has not healed. It is too soon to expect him to be your friend.

So far, they do. But, the quantity, it does not exist. You will have to re-evaluate your needs.
How much tea do you drink, Prime Minister?
It depends on the quality. And, that it be Indian.
Why is it necessary for the Chinese to keep so many soldiers in Lhasa?
To protect. To serve you. Chairman Mao wants you to feel that China belongs to you now.

Chairman Mao can keep China. Just give us back Tibet.
Plans for absorbing the Tibetan army into the People's Army will soon be finalized.
I will not approve it.

Thank you. Please sit.
Have you heard the terms of the Seventeen Point Agreement?
I have.
I have.
I have a copy for you.
Do you have plans to return soon, Dalai Lama?
Soon.
Soon.
Good. Our first request is that you allow us to build a road. You have no roads in Tibet. We can discuss the plans in Lhasa. When you return.
He has been imprisoned, here in the Potala, Holiness.
The Sera monks have surrendered?
The Sera monks have surrendered?
It is calm.
Very complicated, Holiness. Let me tell you current news. The Chinese have launched a deceptive campaign aimed at convincing the world that Tibet belongs to China. We sent a mission to the Chinese National Conference. Our attendance was a grave mistake.
The Tibetans were introduced as delegates from the "Chinese region of Tibet". We protested this reference and demanded a letter rebutting it.

Did you receive the letter?
Did you receive the letter?
We did not.
Of the Tibetan delegations sent abroad, all have been turned away.
All?
And the United Nations? Surely?
The United Nations voted not to hear our appeal.
So, we must face China and all her might alone.
Yes. Most of the Chamdo region is now in Chinese hands. There is a report from Chamdo which makes quite clear that, unless some settlement can soon be reached, Communist troops will soon be marching on Lhasa.

Then, we shall meet.
Your Prime Ministers, support the proposal that you return to Lhasa. On the opposite hand, some officials urge you not to return. They believe you should leave now, for India.
If I were to go into exile, could we expect any serious assistance, from India, suppose?
Oh, no. Where will he go?
Far, far away.
Your father had been very sick.
He had been sick from the time you began growing in me. We thought he would die.

I pooped.
You did. We washed you and wrapped you in sheepskin and took you to your father. That day the father got better. And that day, a pair of crows came to nest in our roof. I just remembered.
I miss my brother.

I miss him too.
I will be back in a few days.

The Four Noble Truths, as taught by the Lord Sakyamuni Buddha are: The Truth of Suffering The Truth of the Cause of Suffering, The Truth of the Cessation of Suffering, the Truth of the Way which leads to the cessation of Suffering.
I accept it. What is suffering?
I accept it. What is suffering?
True suffering arises from contaminated actions and afflictions. Birth, illness, grief, old age, poverty, pain, death -- these are surferings.

Not until you are eighteen.
May I listen to the news with you, Holiness?
Please.
How big is Tibet's army?
Roughly five thousand men.
Roughly five thousand men.
Is that big?
Is that big?
No. Not very big.
No. Not very big.
The Regent is adding men. And he bought rifles and ammunition from India. Mountain guns, too.
Will we be in this war?
No. This war is almost over.
No. This war is almost over.
Will we ever be in war?
In the Pacific Ocean.
It is an island. American territory.

What was the warning of the Thirteenth Dalai Lama?
He warned about the future of Tibet.
He warned about the future of Tibet.
Tell me.
Tell me.
When it is time.
I am sorry for you to have to witness this, Kundun.
Look here!
What can I do? I am only a boy.
You are the man who wrote this letter. You are the man who has come back to lead us. You will soon have great responsibilities. You must know what to do.
I need to know what you know. I am no longer a child.
Ask whatever you will.
Ask whatever you will.
What is the danger from the Chinese, now?
The war is over. This is a time in when nations are redefining themselves.
So, Tibet, too, needs to define itself.
So, Tibet, too, needs to define itself.
Yes. As a free country. But our attempts have proven futile. We continue to be badly outmaneuvered by the Chinese.

And, America?

America, we shall see.
America, we shall see.
Ask the Chinese mission to leave our country. Immediately.
Quite simple. Yes. Good.
I shall send a letter to America, to the President, informing him of our problem.
What is the size of our army, now?
Eight thousand, five hundred, soldiers and officers. We have recently requested mortars, anti-aircraft guns and ammunition from India. We have several hundred in the area.
Has anyone died?
The radio contact said one officer had died. Then he said, "The Chinese soldiers -- they are coming." And then, the radio went dead.
One country did sponsor the resolution. A land called "El Salvador".
Where is that?
Where is that?
In the Americas.
Your prime minsters would argue that such negotiations should take place in Lhasa.
And then they would concede that the times are desperate and we must go to Peking. Agreed. Send Ngabo. Is that all?
It is unlikely. America, perhaps. There is great anti-communist feeling in America.
At this point, the most likely result of a foreign pact is war.

Tibet, at war? No. China is close, America is far away. After countless people die, China would still, always, be close. We will work with what we have.
I am scared.
Shall we consult the protective deities, Holiness?
Shall we consult the protective deities, Holiness?
My first and foremost duty is to protect my people. I feel sure of this. And, things change. Maybe not right away, maybe not soon. But I believe this -- things will change.
Did you ever doubt it?
I had relinquished doubt.
I ask them to stop, to lay down their guns.
The Khamba's gun is his most prized possession. I admire them so. They face a modern, well equipped army, and still, they fight.
Land reform is underway in Amdo. The large estates are being confiscated and redistributed. Landlords are being punished.
A beggar can be called a landlord if he disapproves of the Chinese.
I have always asked for plain information. Just the truth.
The Communists put their guns in the hands of the Khamba children and force the child to kill the parent. They have dropped bombs on the monastery of Lithang in Kham. It has been destroyed. Women and children, trying to escape from the fighting, have been shot with machine guns, fired from airplanes.
The pursuit of non-violence. Very difficult.
Non-violence means co-operation when it is possible. Resistance, when it is not.
They will take Lhasa next.
The people will not allow it.
The crowd will not disperse until you give your assurance that you will not attend the Chinese festivities. Many who have been invited to dine with the Chinese do not return home.
I will not go.
I will not go.
I will alert the Chinese delegation. You know, I would never have let you go alone, Kundun.
We are now accused of aiding the rebels. The Chinese said we can expect drastic measures to be taken to crush this revolt.
Arrange for me to speak to the people's leaders.
Good day.
Good day.
Good day.
Please, come in, so cold.

You must inform me at once if any of our people abuse the Tibetans trust and good nature.
I have great hopes for the future of our co-operation.
I have great hopes for the future of our co-operation.
It is too early to implement all the clauses of the Seventeen Point Agreement. We will establish a Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region of Tibet. The pace of reform must meet with the desires of the Tibetan people. Changes must be made slowly, as you, yourself, judge necessary.
I am happy to hear you say this, Chairman Mao. I have created a reform committee to investigate grievances and we have abolished Inherited Tax, and forgiven all money owed the Government by people who are unable to pay.
Good. Very good. Tibet is a great country. A wonderful history. Long ago, you even conquered part of China. But now you have fallen behind and we want to help you. In twenty years time you could be ahead of us. Then it will be your turn to help China.
You know, I have great respect for your Lord Buddha. He was anti-caste. Anti-corruption. Anti-exploitation. For some, politics and religion can mix.
For me, I think such a mix is crucial.
For me, I think such a mix is crucial.
Have a sweet. Made in my home province. The kind my mother used to make.
Ah, Dalai Lama, thank you for coming so late.
I leave tomorrow.
I leave tomorrow.
Yes, I am aware. How has your time in China been?
I have been greatly impressed by your accomplishments. Industrial progress. Great efficiency. Your people are capable and courteous.
You have a lot to learn about organization. How to draw out people's opinions. How to make key decisions. Train your young Tibetans. When I make contact with you, I want to reach you through a Tibetan.

Always.
I have news. The Regent has resigned his post.
Is he a bad man? Norbu says he is "lavish" and "willful". "How can he give you monk's vows if he has not kept them himself?"

But you will always be here?
But you will always be here?
Me?
Me?
You will always!
You will always!
I have one more piece of news. A baby is coming.
Do you think I must?
You decide.
This little brother was terribly sweet. When he died, my mother was so sad. A lama said to her, before the little brother was laid out for burial, take a bit of butter and rub a spot on his skin. He will come back to you, you will see. So, my mother did this, and a few years later, a new boy was born.
Does he have the spot?

He does, a little spot where the butter had been.

I'm on a big mountain and hitting at the bad men.
And after the game, we're going to trade. You just stay over there, no, there!, Norbu, and I will shoot at you. I want your land. I take it. I am stronger.

Things change, Kundun.
Why is your beard so funny? Let me touch this.
She carried a basket in her arms, a big, heavy basket, and the old monk cautiously approached. She opened her basket and showed what she had. Heads. Human heads. Only the heads.

Ahh.
Why is this? What is happening? Tell me!
Reting Rinpoche has been arrested. He tried to overthrow Regent Taktra. Today, he is brought back to Lhasa by government officials. The monks at Sera Monastery have been on his side. Now, there is trouble between them and the army.
The people want you made Dalai Lama.
Then, I am lucky. I am still too young.

It may not be your decision to make.
Taktra Rinpoche, I understand there was an attempt on your life.
It is possible, Holiness.
It is possible, Holiness.
You are unharmed?
You are unharmed?
Completely.
Completely.
Good. Where is Reting Rinpoche now?
If we agree that we are part of China, nothing else will matter. Not trade, not defense. We will be lost.
What would you do, Holiness?
What should I do about my doubt, Teacher?
It is a difficult situation.

I mean, my doubt. Why me? Am I Him?

Mrs. Bickerman, the reason we're up here... a man was fatally attacked yesterday by some animal in this lake. Do you know how your husband died?
Oh yes. I killed him.
You killed him.
Oh, yes.
He just <u>appeared</u>. You have no idea how he arrived in this lake?
No. Do you?
You can't take a cow by eminent domain.
We won't let him get hurt, Ma'am.

My department doesn't have any record of that, Mrs. Bickerman.
My department doesn't have any record of that, Mrs. Bickerman.
Oh well, I'm sorry. I didn't realize you keep such a firm track of the dead.
And how would you have accomplished this, Ma'am?
Well, he was very ill and he refused to go see a doctor and well... I think he had Alzheimer's, he would be coherent one day, incoherent the next and one <u>coherent</u> day, he asked me to end his suffering. I wouldn't <u>do</u> it but he kept insisting and insisting and deteriorating till the point the only cognitive thing he could really do was
I haven't broken any laws.
Oh, but you <u>have</u>, Ma'am. You lied to us, that could be obstruction of justice. A man's been killed in part 'cause of your silence, I could make out a charge of reckless endangerment and I'm sure PETA would be annoyed at how you treat your cows.

The <u>reason</u> I lied is if I'd told you the truth, you'd just hunt it down and kill it which seems to be exactly what you're doing.
Ma'am. Your husband, Bernie. You didn't, by any chance, lead him to the lake blindfolded?
<u>No</u>, <u>I</u> <u>did</u> <u>not</u>. The crocodile <u>did</u> kill him, though. But it was all... it was a mistake.
Ma'am, how could you not report this? He puts human life at risk and--
Nobody <u>lives</u> on this lake. it's really <u>his</u> lake now.
Murders and rapes in the cities. People bomb planes... can the police stop them? <u>No</u>. But feed one little cow to a crocodile...
You're to wait right here until the police show, you're under full house arrest.

He's not gonna hurt <u>me</u>.
I might get a shot.
<u>No</u>. If you don't kill him instantly, I'm dead and you'll only kill him instantly if you get his brain, which is about the size of a cherry. And even if you <u>were</u> on target, a bullet might not penetrate his hide.

Around here. Yeah.

No crocodile has ever--
Again. Not to be disruptive. Do we have a problem with it dying?
Crocodiles don't sever with their teeth, their molars are blunt.
Is this a trick?
What I'm saying is <u>if</u> it's a crocodile that cut a man in half he would have to be over twenty feet which would make him well over a hundred years old, it would be unthinkable to destroy him.
I brought a pork chop, maybe we could hang it around your neck for luck.
No thank you, but maybe later you can chew the bark off my big fat log.
Was he a good man?
Yup.
Yup.
Whenever somebody dies I consider it such a waste that I didn't know him better.
His head was just... bitten off.
I used to have this recurring nightmare that I was headless.
This is a setback.
You don't want to cut me down. 'Cause I'll kill you.
Promise you won't kill me, first.
I have no interest in ever looking at you, Hector. Could you please cut me down?
Asia? How... how could he get here?
Obviously some asshole in Hong Kong flushed him down a toilet.
Maybe he doesn't play well with others.
Is everything a big fucking joke to you?
Is everything a big fucking joke to you?
<u>Bite</u> <u>my</u> <u>bishop</u>.
What's that?
It came from across the lake.
Just spit him back out. Some shall live, some shall die, arbitrarily, sound like any higher power we know?
He didn't eat the kid cause he'd just swallowed a bear.

I can arrest you!!
Then do it!!

You probably <u>do</u> want to be killed by it, that was you trying to meet your maker.
You probably <u>do</u> want to be killed by it, that was you trying to meet your maker.
So profound and fat.
Gee, that would really disappoint me.
Forget about him being God, he's thirty feet long, he <u>is</u> a miracle of nature, who somehow made his way to Maine. This is a grand beast. <u>A</u> <u>grand</u> <u>dragon</u>. An attempt should at least be made to capture him alive.
No!
I just have this feeling everything's totally safe.
I just have this feeling everything's totally safe.
I see blood. Maybe you got him, Hank.
Where is he?!
I don't know!
At school they'd always say "go" first.
Get your big gun and guard the shore. Hector. Go to your tent.
Get your big gun and guard the shore. Hector. Go to your tent.
He never said "go".

Get the gun.
This time, <u>I'm</u> gonna kick your ass.
Bastard bit my chopper.
Bastard bit my chopper.
Hey!!
Let's not overlook he didn't eat me, maybe--
'Cause he just ate a cow, you stupid--
Well, you can try talking them into that, if--
I have enough flaxedil with me to put him out. And I think I know a way to--
I have enough flaxedil with me to put him out. And I think I know a way to--
<u>Forget</u> <u>it</u>.
<u>Forget</u> <u>it</u>.
Look. I know I'm crazy, but when they come, they will kill it. They have to, politically, he's too dangerous, if something were to go wrong... the odds are he will be destroyed,--
No way.
Jack. We've all seen it. He's probably a hundred and fifty years old, he's bigger than an elephant.
So maybe Wildlife will try to save him, they're more equipped to--
We both know what they'll do.
And again. How would you get him on land?
That's actually the easy part.
Keep enough tension to hold him up, Hector, we don't know if he can swim.
Right.
Right.
The more he thrashes, the better.
The more he thrashes, the better.
You ready on shore?

We're ready.
I got something on the screen.
You do?
Where? Where?
Thirty meters or so. Moving slow, but straight toward Elsie.

Can you confirm visually or just radar?

Radar, he's underwater. But he's definitely coming.
Radar, he's underwater. But he's definitely coming.
Okay. Lead him in. Okay, everybody up on the trucks. We aim for the stomach or side... there's little chance the darts will pierce his hide. <u>Everybody</u> <u>up</u> <u>on</u> <u>the</u> <u>trucks</u>.
Almost here, Hector. Don't forget to lift up the cow.
Thank you, Jack.
Thank you, Jack.
You shoot on my order. If he charges, I'll be yelling "go" which means drivers take off. And drive fast, they can move on land. You set?
Where is he?
Tranq guns down, rifles up!
<u>No</u>. Look. He's got nothing left.
Yeah and every time we think there's no more danger--
You take care.
You talk to Bickerman?
You talk to Bickerman?
She didn't tell us about the other croc 'cause she was afraid we'd blow it's head off.

Women's intuition. Are there anymore?
Women's intuition. Are there anymore?
Just those two.
Hector. The big one has no sense of humor. And since <u>he's</u> the one who decides whether you get to play, try not to be your obnoxious self.
That hurt my feelings.
If he's here, I'll find him. Did she tell you we had sex together?
I never had sex with you!
I never had sex with you!
Even so, you're allowed to boast. You look thin by the way, I've mentally undressed you, I can see your ribcage.
But they're nighttime hunters, Hector, he'd probably be on land now anyway.
'Cept he wasn't before, was he? You know, when friends or family members say things, they tend not to register so sometimes it helps to hear it from a total stranger. You're fat.

<u>Hector</u>.
None of us actually <u>saw</u> anything. I realize this Sir, but something flipped us over, I doubt very much it was a mink.
What's going on?
Such the flirt.
U.S. Wildlife won't send anybody without a confirmation.
You <u>should</u> take a flax pole.
And what if I tranq him Kelly? He drowns. You think about that?
And what if I tranq him Kelly? He drowns. You think about that?
I'm just saying last resort.
Two years married, divorced, used to be a lawyer, quit, I'm still waiting on his sperm count.
What? Oh as <u>if</u> I'm interested.
What? Oh as <u>if</u> I'm interested.
As if. Will you miss me?
He was an Indo-pacific.
Are you sure?
Are you sure?
Scales were oval. It was an <u>Asian</u> crocodile.

I'm a civilian! You don't have any authority--
<u>Did</u> you want to be killed by it?
You think I'm <u>that</u> nuts?
You think I'm <u>that</u> nuts?
Hector. What you just did... there was at least some sort of a death wish going on.
Hector. What you just did... there was at least some sort of a death wish going on.
Nothing's real.

Excuse me?
Excuse me?
<u>Nothing's</u> real. I'm rich, people are automatically my friends, sycophants ooze out like oil slicks and and and--

Can I tell them you won't go back in the water?
Can I tell them you won't go back in the water?
Yes. You may. But maybe... I don't know...
What?
Could we have intercourse?
They're not going to be able to snag him in pitmans. Tranq him in water, he drowns.
They could try to tranq him on land.
They could try to tranq him on land.
They won't. He's taken human life, the mission will be to put him down.
And how would we neutralize him?
We lure him on land and pump him with the drugs.
I'm okay.
You're not okay, your leg's a mess.
You're gonna be okay.
Guess I finally got bit.
Guess I finally got bit.
Yeah, you got bit. I'm gonna fix it.
He's gonna live?
Yeah. Thanks to you.
Yeah. Thanks to you.
And Hank. I know you weren't really trying to hit him.
Kelly Scott.
Jack Wells. A museum sent you?
Jack Wells. A museum sent you?
Are we all museum bigots in Maine?
Did you make anything of the tooth?
Yes, it <u>did</u> seem prehistoric but I'm sure he just carried the thing for luck. Not that it <u>worked</u>, obviously. It probably somehow got lodged into his body.
Excuse me. One other thing, it's a <u>small</u> point, but... I have a thing about being humored, and I'm feeling humored, more by <u>him</u>, but you seemed quick to join in.
Ma'am, your first impression isn't going well.
How big do the bears get?
Big but... a bear couldn't do that to a moose or man in <u>water</u>. On <u>land</u> maybe. But...

Hector Cyr. He's a rich kook mythology professor. He's done some work with our museum. He also treks the world to swim with crocodiles.
In Maine?
There <u>have</u> been Northern sightings. But not <u>this</u> North.
Same thing from Fish And Game.
<u>Something's</u> in that water.

Adult males will charge hatchlings. If there's one out there...
If one could be out there... why does Fish And Game tell me it's impossible?
If one could be out there... why does Fish And Game tell me it's impossible?
Because they just consult their little indigenous charts.
He could be right there and you wouldn't see him.
I'd be able to see something.
What are you doing?
Skipping stones. Look how flat that water is, you can get ten skips on a good one.
Listen, uh... Hank and I think it best if you stay on shore.
I beg your pardon?

I'm sorry but you're...
Okay. We're up at six.
Good.
Good.
'Night.
He thinks they're what?
In his defense, every primitive culture known to man deified them. He's a mythology professor, he thinks crocs are divine conduits.
They respond pretty quick. I'll wait till you get down before I turn it on.
Good. See ya soon.
Good. See ya soon.
Good luck.
You okay? Kelly?

Police want to keep it quiet, if the press gets word... lake monster. They just want us to sit tight.
<u>Are</u> you okay?
Um... y'know... Yeah.
Hard to believe there could be a monster under such peacefulness.
I thought I might track the shoreline tomorrow, look for prints.
You know they say the brain confuses fear for passion.
Excuse me?
Excuse me?
When you get scared, the brain releases a chemical, same chemical it releases when somebody's... in high school, the thing to do was to take the girl to a scary movie.

Why he's that <u>big</u>, I don't know. Why he's <u>here</u>... the wetlands are being developed, crocodiles are moving. Australia, Fiji, the things have started to cross oceans.
But why <u>Maine</u> and why alone? Crocs are social, why's this guy on the move by himself?

That's why you're here. To get in the middle of something?
Maybe. I've always <u>read</u> about what's happened. I've never... I know it sounds silly but, it's nice to be someplace <u>while</u> something is actually... y'know... happening.

Hector.
He's mooing.
You wouldn't?
Watch out!!
Keep firing!
Hector!!
Take him.
We gotta get to Hector!!
Back us in a little, we need to get a shot!
He's through fighting. Look at him.
I don't care. Hank. End it.
Get him onto shore.
He heeds a tourniquet.
Well...
You wanna ride in my truck?
You sure? I don't mind...
No, I actually <u>want</u> to stay for a little while.
If I'm ever in New York...
Yeah.
Y'know, if we didn't live in separate worlds and...
But we do. Hey, we'll always have Maine.
It was... something meeting you.
Likewise.
Different worlds, Jack.
Yeah, I thought about that as I was driving... and... I haven't found somebody in my world. You found anyone in yours?
Yeah, I thought about that as I was driving... and... I haven't found somebody in my world. You found anyone in yours?

Worth a try. We don't wanna be alone forever, do we?
Probably not.
That was... y'know if the guy asks me can she kiss, now I'll be able to tell him if you can.
Good thinking.
We set?
Ready. A museum in New York sent us some additional back up.
I'm ready when you are.
Let's go.
Half mile up, there's a clearing.
You gonna dig up that lady's husband?

Hank. The little cannon you brought, get it. Guard the shoreline. Otherwise, we're done. We made the I.D., our job is finished.
Alright, Ms. Paleontologist. I wanna know why that monster is here. You got a theory?
You said nobody came in here!
Obviously I was wrong!
Get back from the shore. We know how fast he can leap out.
We shouldn't even really be doing this.

They won't be here till at least noon. We got a few hours to kill.

Now I'm gonna puke.
<u>You</u> <u>gotta</u> <u>be</u> <u>kidding</u>.
Even if we <u>could</u> tranq him-- how would we get him on land.
Other than to eat us?
I can't. I'll get Hector!!
Where is he?!
If you get a safe shot...
I'll take it!
I'll take it!
Hector. <u>Do</u> <u>not</u> <u>move</u>.
He's done. He's dying.
Don't count on it. We better take him out.
Thanks for your help.
You too.

Nobody lives within twenty-five miles, 'cept some old couple who live right on the lake. Teenagers trek in every once in a while, none have disappeared, and none have spotted anything unusual.

They don't believe her.
Thank you, it's so rewarding to imagine my tax dollar finding its way to you, you Fucker.
You hurt his feelings. I think you should go apologize.
<u>Apologize</u>?
Is this 'spose to make me take him more serious?
It's to make you <u>understand</u> him, with understanding comes tolerance. Too bad they don't put proverbs in Twinkies, my load would be lighter.

Hector, Jack, we show you with about twelve minutes of oxygen left, and you're on the last tank. Time to go home.
<u>That</u> was a bust.
What was that?
I don't know. It was like a tug. Something tugged us.
Are you alright?
I think. My hair. Where's Hector?! Where is he?
Hank?
Yes.
Are you okay?
Other than feeling slightly embarrassed, I'm perfectly fine. Could you cut me down?
Hank!
He said he knew Karate!
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
Look.
What is she doing <u>now</u>? <u>Mother</u> <u>of</u> <u>God</u>.
What?
What?
Look ten feet into the water.
If he gets close, you go <u>up</u>, Hector, don't you endanger that cow.
She's worried about the cow now.
They're coming right in.

Wait.
I'm sure this would offend you on principal but... could we keep in touch?
I guess.
Kelly.
Kevin, hey.
Hi. Listen. Could I steal you a second?
Absolutely.
I had a great time last night. Again.
Me too.
That's not what you came to say.
You work for me. I'm not comfortable with-- y'know, "us"...
I was working for you when "us" started, what's--
I know and I thought I could handle it but work and pleasure along with somebody else, it's a dangerous mix.

Yeah, that part. There's... somebody who's um...
Yeah, that part. There's... somebody who's um...
Else.
Oh. Oh. That's okay. Well. This uh... this probably wasn't meant to be, y'know. I mean, I'm... God, I gotta be ten years younger and you, <u>you</u>... you're y'know...
A jerk.

This is business. There was an accident in Maine, some guy got killed by something in a lake. Probably a bear, but... they found a tooth.

Stay cool. Just remember to call him "God."
Phone call, Clarice. It's God.
Thanks, Ardelia.
You missed Fourth Amendment law. Unlawful seizure, real juicy stuff. Where were you all afternoon?
Pleading with a crazy man, with come all over my face.
Boy, is that smart...
Why does she keep repeating the name?
Why does she keep repeating the name?
Somebody's coaching her... They're trying to make him see Catherine as a person - not just an object.
No. He won't come after me.
Why not?
Why not?
It would be rude. And he wouldn't get to ask any more questions...
Clarice - you did the best anybody could have for Catherine Martin. You stuck your neck out for her and you got your butt kicked for her and you tried. It's not your fault it ended this way.
The worst part - the thing that's making me crazy - is that Bill is right in front of me. Only I can't see him... Lecter said, everything I need to catch him is right here, in these pages...

The one that was weighted down. Where is she...? Fred something.
Fredrica Bimmel, from Belvedere, Ohio. The first girl taken, but the third body found... Why?
'Cause she didn't drift. He weighted her down.

Agent Starling! Telephone!
Agent Mapp! Thank you!
Get your field gear, take stuff for overnight. You're goin' with Crawford.
Where?
Where?
Some fishermen in West Virginia found an unidentified girl's body. It's a Buffalo Bill-type situation. Been in the water about a week, and Jack needs somebody that can print a floater. Think you can handle it?

I'll need the big fingerprint kit... and the one-to-one Polaroid, the CU- 5, with film packs and batteries.
Jack's pretty tough on you, isn't he? Impatient...
Sometimes.
Sometimes.
He's got a lot on his mind besides Buffalo Bill... His wife, Bella, is real sick. Comatose... I'm tellin' you about it now, 'cause he may never.
Wear it, don't ever leave it in your purse. Dry fire it whenever you get the chance. And do your exercises.
I will... I promise.
I will... I promise.
Listen, I hope you never need a thing I've taught you. But you've got something... Jack sees it, I do too. If you ever need to, you can shoot.
FBI, Catherine, you're safe.
Safe, SHIT, he's got a gun! Getmeout. GET ME OUT!

NOOOOO! You fucking bitch don't you LEAVE ME down here, DON'T YOU - YOU
Shut UP! The other officers will be here any minute! you're perfectly safe now!
I'm sure it's a great town, Dr. Chilton, but my instructions are to talk to Lecter and report back this afternoon.
I see. Let's make this quick, then. I'm busy.
Lecter carved up nine people - that we're sure of - and cooked his favorite bits. We've tried to study him, of course - but he's much too sophisticated for the standard tests. And my, does he hate us! Thinks I'm his nemesis... Crawford's very clever, isn't he? Using you.
How do you mean, Dr. Chilton?
How do you mean, Dr. Chilton?
A pretty young woman, to turn him on? I don't believe Lecter's ever seen a woman in eight years. And oh, are you ever his "taste" - so to speak.

I graduated magna from UVA, Doctor. It's not a charm school.

Good. Then you should be able to remember the rules.
Do not reach through the bars, do not touch the bars. You pass him nothing but soft paper - no pens or pencils. No staples or paperclips in his paper. Use the sliding food carrier, no exceptions. Do not accept anything he attempts to hold out to you. Do you understand me?
I understand.
I understand.
I'm going to show you why we insist on such precautions... On the afternoon of July 8, 1981, he complained of chest pains and was taken to the dispensary. His mouthpiece and restraints were removed for an EKG. When the nurse bent over him, he did this to her...
Dr. Chilton - if Lecter feels you're his enemy - as you've said - then maybe I'll have more luck by myself. What do you think?
You might have suggested that in my office, and saved me the time.
You might have suggested that in my office, and saved me the time.
But then I would've missed the pleasure of your company.
What you're doing, Miss Starling, is coming into my hospital to conduct an interview, and refusing to share information with me. For the third time!
Dr. Chilton, I told you - this is just routine follow-up on the Raspail case.
Dr. Chilton, I told you - this is just routine follow-up on the Raspail case.
He's my patient! I have rights! I'm not just some turnkey, Miss Starling. I shouldn't even be here this afternoon. I had a ticket to Holiday on Ice.
You're out of line, Starling, and you're off this case. Back to Quantico.
Sir, Mr. Crawford instructed me -
Sir, Mr. Crawford instructed me -
Your instructions are what I'm giving you now. Jack Crawford answers to the Director, and the Director answers to me. My God, Crawford's losing it...! He shouldn't even be on this, with his wife sick as she is... How the hell did you get in here, anyway? He gave you - what? Some kind of special ID? Let's have it.

Gun. Jesus. Turn in the ID as soon as you get back. The gun, too. Be on the next plane, Starling, there's one in 90 minutes.
Mr. Krendler... Dr. Lecter trusts me. Or at least, he used to. If I could just -
Lecter has already named Buffalo Bill.
He gave us a perfectly good description, and we're on it now, so we won't be needing your little novelty act any longer - or his, either. He's under close guard at the courthouse, pending a prison transfer. The next plane, Officer.
Sir, doesn't this "William Rubin" strike you as - I don't know - kind of vague?
Do you need a police escort, Starling? Or do you think you can find the airport by yourself?
Yes sir. I can find it by myself.
Maybe he lives in this, this Belvedere, Ohio, too! Maybe he saw her every day, and killed her sort of spontaneously. Maybe he just meant to... give her a 7-Up and talk about the choir. But then -
Starling -
Starling -
But then he had to cover up, make her seem just like all the rest of them. That's what Lecter was hinting!

The market in Lecter hints is way down, today, okay? I've got two good men dead in Memphis, and three civilians. I've got -
Not to my knowledge. Privacy is a great concern to my customers. But, if you say this is an FBI matter...
I won't disturb anything, Mr. Yow, I promise. Be gone before you know it.
Mr. Yow, if this door should fall down -ha ha! - or anything else - would you be kind enough to call this number? It's our Baltimore field office. They know you're here with me... Do you understand?
Might I suggest tucking your pants into your socks? To prevent mouse intrusion.

Okay, Miss Starling?
Okay, Mr. Yow...
You're playing a piano, Miss Starling?
That wasn't me.

Oh.
Mr. Yow? Oh Mr. Yow...? It looks like somebody is sitting in this car.
Oh my! Oh my... Maybe you better come out now, Miss Starling.
Oh my! Oh my... Maybe you better come out now, Miss Starling.
Not yet! - just wait for me. Maybe in about two seconds.
Excuse me, but I really do need to talk to you. This was Mrs. Lippman's house. Did you know her?
Just briefly. What's the problem, Officer?
I'm investigating the death of Fredrica Bimmel. Who are you, please?
Jack Gordon.
Jack Gordon.
Mr. Gordon, did you know Fredrica when she worked for Mrs. Lippman?
Mr. Gordon, did you know Fredrica when she worked for Mrs. Lippman?
No. Wait... Was she a great, fat person? I may have seen her, I'm not sure...
Mrs. Lippman had a son, maybe he could help you. I have his card somewhere. Do you mind stepping inside, while I looks for it?
Thanks.
Are they close to catching somebody, do you think?
I think we may be, yes.
Mr. Gordon, did you take over this place after Mrs. Lippman died?
Yes. I bought the house from her, two years ago.
Yes. I bought the house from her, two years ago.
Did she leave any records here? Tax or business records? Maybe a list of employees?
Starling, Clarice M., good morning.
Good morning, Mr. Crawford.
Good morning, Mr. Crawford.
Your instructors tell me you're doing well. Top quarter of the class.

I hope so. They haven't posted anything.
I hope so. They haven't posted anything.
A job's come up and I thought about you. Not really a job, more of - an interesting errand. Walk me to my car, Starling.
We're trying to interview all of the serial killers now in custody, for a psychobehavioral profile. Could be a big help in unsolved cases. Most of them have been happy to talk to us. They have a compulsion to boast, these people... Do you spook easily, Starling?
Not yet.
Not yet.
You see, the one we want most refuses to cooperate. I want you to go after him again today, in the asylum.
You see, the one we want most refuses to cooperate. I want you to go after him again today, in the asylum.
Who's the subject?
Who's the subject?
The psychiatrist - Dr. Hannibal Lecter.
Yes, well... Okay, right. I'm glad for the chance, sir, but - why me?
You're qualified and available. And frankly, I can't spare a real agent right now.
Now. I want your full attention, Starling. Are you listening to me?
Yes sir.
Yes sir.
Be very careful with Hannibal Lecter. Dr. Chilton at the asylum will go over the physical procedures used with him. Do not deviate from them, for any reason. You tell him nothing personal, Starling. Believe me, you don't want Hannibal Lecter inside your head... Just do your job, but never forget what he is.

And what is that, sir?
I've read your interim memo on Lecter. You sure you've left nothing out?
It's all there, sir, practically verbatim.

Every word, Starling? Every gesture?

He mentioned a name, at the very end. "Mofet..." Any followup on her?
He mentioned a name, at the very end. "Mofet..." Any followup on her?
I spent all evening on the mainframe. Lecter altered or destroyed most of his patient histories, prior to capture. No record of anyone named Mofet. But "Split City" sounded like it might have have something to do with divorce. I tracked it down in the library's catalogue of national yellow pages. It's a mini-storage facility outside Baltimore, where Lecter had his practice.
Well? Why aren't you there right now?
Sir, that's a field job. It's outside the scope of my assignment. And I've got a test tomorrow on -

Miggs has been murdered.

Murdered...? How?
Murdered...? How?
The orderly heard Lecter whispering to him, all afternoon, and Miggs crying. They found him at bed check. He'd swallowed his own tongue... Chilton is scared stiff the family will file a civil rights lawsuit, and he's trying to blame it on you. I told the little prick your conduct was flawless. Starling...?

I'm here, sir, I just - I don't know how to feel about it.
I'm here, sir, I just - I don't know how to feel about it.
You don't have to feel any way about it. Lecter did it to amuse himself. Why not, what can they do? Take away his books for awhile, and no jello... I know it got ugly today. But this is your report, Starling - take it as far as you can. On your own time, outside of class. Now carry on.
Blue square for Belvedere, Ohio, where the Bimmel girl was abducted. Blue triangle where her body was found - down here in Missouri. Same marks for the other four girls, in different colors. This new one, today... washed up here. Elk River, in West Virginia, about six miles below U.S. 79. Real boonies.
There's no correlation at all between where they're kidnapped and where they're found...? What if - what if you trace the heaviest-traffic routes backwards from the dump sites? Do they converge at all?

Good idea, but he thought of it, too. We've run simulations, using different vectors and the best dates we can assign. You put it all in the computer, and smoke comes out. No, this one is different. This one has seen us coming...
Talk about him, Starling. Tell me what you see.
He's a white male... Serial killers tend to hunt within their own ethnic group. And he's not a drifter - he's got his own house, somewhere. Not an apartment.

Why?
Why?
What he does with them - takes privacy... Time, tools... He's in his 30's or 40's - he's got real physical strength, but combined with an older man's self-control. He's cautious, precise, never impulsive... This won't end in suicide, like they often do.

Maybe you've got a knack for this... I guess we're about to find out.
Like I have a "knack" for Dr. Lecter?
Okay, Starling. Let's have it.
You haven't said a word today about that garage. Or what I found there.

What should I say? You did fine work. We'll wait on the lab.

Are you finished?
Are you finished?
He starts this - buzzing in me, in my head. He makes me feel violated... You used me, Mr. Crawford.
What do you see, Starling?
Well, she's not local. Her ears are pierced three times each, and she's wearing green glitter nail polish. Looks like town to me...
I don't know. I didn't see those on any of the other girls...
They weren't there. Get close-ups.
When I told that sheriff we shouldn't talk in front of a woman, that really burned you, didn't it? That was just smoke, Starling, I had to get rid of him. You did well in there.
It matters, Mr. Crawford... Other cops know who you are. They look at you to see how to act... It matters.
It matters, Mr. Crawford... Other cops know who you are. They look at you to see how to act... It matters.
Point taken.
When we get back, I want you to run that bug by the Smithsonian, see if they can identify it. Maybe it's got some limited range, or it only breeds at certain times of year... You found it, Starling, you deserve the credit.
I'm wondering if he's done that before - placed a cocoon, or an insect. It would be easy to miss in an autopsy, especially with a floater... Can we check back on that?

You seem pretty sure of that.
You seem pretty sure of that.
Raspail was killed by the same man who's killing these girls. And Lecter knows him. Maybe even treated him... You think so, too, don't you? Or you'd never have sent me to that asylum.
But for Catherine Martin, it all comes down to you and Lecter. You're the one he talks to.
He's already offered to help... What would happen if we just showed our cards - asked him for Bill?
He's already offered to help... What would happen if we just showed our cards - asked him for Bill?
He offered to help, Starling, not to snitch. That wouldn't give him enough chance to show off. Remember, Lecter looks mainly for fun. Never forget fun.

But if he knew we have so little time -

She doesn't know what we're up to. And we can't afford to let her find out.
Chilton has killed her, hasn't he? That slimy little bastard! We were so close with Lecter - and now her last chance is gone.
Let's get some coffee and talk.
Are you in trouble over this, Mr. Crawford? Can Senator Martin do something to you?
I'm 53, Starling. If I found Jimmy Hoffa on national TV, I'd still have to retire in two years. It's not a consideration. But you are... You've done enough. If I keep you out of school any longer, you'll be recycled. Cost you six months, at least. I can guarantee you readmission here, but that's about it. Now's your chance, Starling. Go back to

If you didn't want me chasing him, you shouldn't have taken me to that funeral home.
Lecter is still the key, I know he is. Whatever he told me about Bill is just as good now as it was before.
Or just as worthless. But I want you in Memphis, close to him. Maybe when he gets tired of toying with Senator Martin, he'll talk to you again. There's a plane waiting for you now at the airstrip.
I lied to Lecter. I'll need some kind of peace offering... Can I get the drawings from his cell?
Good idea. Meantime, try to get a feel for Catherine Martin. Her apartment, her friends... how he might've stalked her. I'm going to the other two clinics, Minnesota and Ohio. Now's the hardest part, Starling. Use your anger, don't let it keep you from thinking. Just keep your eyes on Catherine. We've got less than 30 hours.

Mr. Crawford... can those cops down there handle Dr. Lecter?
Mr. Crawford... can those cops down there handle Dr. Lecter?
They'll use their best men. But they better be paying attention...
All his victims are women... His obsession is women, he lives to hunt women. But not one women is hunting him - except me. I can walk in a woman's room and know three times as much about her as a man would. I have to go to Belvedere.
You heard them. I don't have that authority anymore.
You heard them. I don't have that authority anymore.
You do until six p.m.
Ohio is cold ground. Picked over, ten months ago. Our people worked it, so did the locals.
But not from this angle. Not thinking he knew her. You've got to send me!

He's going to kill her, Mr. Crawford. This morning, or maybe at noon, but today, and Belvedere's our last chance. I'm flying there, right now, unless you stop me. You want my ID? Here - take it...
He's making himself a "woman suit," Mr. Crawford - out of real women! And he can sew, this guy, he's really skilled. A dressmaker, or a tailor -

Where?
Sir, that's great news. But how -
Johns Hopkins finally came up with a name for us. We fed him into Known Offenders, and he came up cherries. Subject's name is "Jamie Gumb," AKA "John Grant." Lecter's description was accurate, he just lied about the name.
This Gumb's a real beauty. Slaughtered both his grandparents when he was twelve, and did nine years in juvenile psychiatric. Where, Starling, he took vocational rehab, and learned a useful trade...
Sewing...
Sewing...
Take a bow. Customs had some paper on his alias. They stopped a carton two years ago at LAX - live caterpillars from Surinam. The addressee was "John Grant." Calumet Power & Light's given us two possible residences under that alias. We're hitting one, Chicago SWAT's taking the other.

No, Starling, there isn't time. And you've still got crucial work to do in Ohio. We want him for murder, not kidnapping. I'm counting on you to link him to the Bimmel girl, before he's indicted.
Yes sir... I'll do my best.
Starling - you've earned back your place in the Academy. We never would've found him without you, and nobody's ever going to forget that. Least of all me.

Oh sure, me'n Pam Malavesi used to help her do alterations for old Mrs. Lippman. Lots of people worked for her, she had the business from all these retail stores? But she was like, totally old, it was more'n she could handle.

You get to travel around and stuff? I mean, better places then this?

Freddie was so happy for me when I got this job. This - toaster giveaways, and Barry Manilow on the speakers all day - she thought this was really hot shit. What did she know, big dummy...
Doctor, we have a hard problem in psychological profiling. I want to ask for your help with a questionnaire.

Now then. What did Miggs say to you? "Multiple Miggs," in the next cell. He hissed at you. What did he say?
He said - "I can smell your cunt."
He said - "I can smell your cunt."

Memory, Officer Starling, is what I have instead of view.
Dr. Lecter, if you'd please consider -
No, no, no. You were doing fine, you'd been courteous and receptive to courtesy, you'd established trust with the embarrassing truth about Miggs, and now this ham-handed segue into your questionnaire. It won't do. It's stupid and boring.

Oh, Officer Starling... do you think you can dissect me with this blunt little tool?
No. I only hoped that your knowledge -
You see a lot, Dr. Lecter. But are you strong enough to point that high- powered perception at yourself? How about it...? Look at yourself and write down the truth. Or maybe you're afraid to.
You're a tough one, aren't you?
You're a tough one, aren't you?
Reasonably so. Yes.

What's that, Dr. Lecter?
What's that, Dr. Lecter?
Advancement, of course. Go to Split City. See Miss Mofet, an old patient of mine. M-O-F-E-T... Now go. Go. I don't think Miggs could manage again so soon, even if he is crazy - do you?
Your bleeding has stopped.

His real name is Benjamin Raspail. A former patient of mine, whose romantic attachments ran to, shall we say, the exotic...? I didn't kill him, merely tucked him away. Very much as I found him, in that ridiculous car, in his own garage, after he's missed three appointments. You'd have him under "Missing Person" - which, in poor Raspail's case, could hardly be more

Or doesn't this all begin to suggest to you a kind of... negotiation? There's something Crawford can give me, and I want to trade for it. I even wrote to him, offering my help. But he hates me, so he won't deal directly.
Punishment, you see. For Miggs. Just like that gospel program. When you leave, they'll turn the volume way up. Chilton does enjoy his petty torments.

I was your choice, Dr. Lecter. You chose to speak to me. Would you prefer someone else now? Or perhaps you don't think you can help us.

Got dressed without turning on the light. I went downstairs... outside...
They were slaughtering the spring lambs?
Yes...! They were screaming.

Where were you going?
I don't know. I had no food or water. It was very cold. I thought - if I can even save just one... but he got so heavy. So heavy...
I didn't get more than a few miles before the sheriff's car found me. The rancher was so angry he sent me to live at the Lutheran orphanage in Bozeman. I never saw the ranch again...
But what became of your lamb? Clarice...?
You still wake up sometimes, don't you? Wake up in the dark, with the lambs screaming?
Yes...

Yes. I'll tell you.
Promise...? Then why not take your case file? I won't be needing it anymore.
Starling.
Well, Clarice, have the lambs stopped screaming...?
Your lambs are still for now, Clarice, but not forever... You'll have to earn it again and again, this blessed silence. Because it's the plight that drives you, and the plight will never end.
Dr. Lecter -
Dr. Lecter -
I have no plans to call on you, Clarice, the world being more interesting with you in it. Be sure you extend me the same courtesy.

You know I can't make that promise.
You know I can't make that promise.
Goodbye, Clarice... You looked - so very lovely today, in your blue suit.
I'm not having a witch hunt here, Mr. Crawford! Our patients are decent, non-violent people with a real problem.
Dr. Danielson, the man we want was never your patient. It would be someone you refused because he tries to conceal a record of criminal violence. Please, Doctor - time is eating us up. Just show me the ones you've turned away.
Examination and interview materials are confidential. We've never violated an applicant's trust, and we never will.
You want to see a violation? This is a violation...
Her name is Kimberly Jane Emberg, she was just ID'd. I met her on a slab in West Virginia. And sometime tomorrow, or tomorrow night, he's going to do the same thing to Catherine Martin.
That's a childish, bullying stunt, Mr. Crawford. I was a battlefield surgeon, so you can put away your picture.
Look... search your own records, if you prefer. You can do it a lot faster than us, anyway. If we find Buffalo Bill through your information, I'll suppress it. Nobody has to know this hospital cooperated.
I doubt very much that the FBI or any other government agency can keep a secret, Mr. Crawford. Truth will out... And then what? Will you give Johns Hopkins a new identity? Put a big pair of sunglasses on this building, and a funny nose?

Oh, that's clever, Dr. Danielson. Very humorous. You like the truth? Try this. He kidnaps young women and kills them and rips their skin off. We don't want him to do that anymore. If you don't help me, just as fast as you can, then the Justice Department is going to ask publicly for a court order, We'll ask twice a day, just in

It may be that - I could confer with my colleagues on this. And get back to you.
It may be that - I could confer with my colleagues on this. And get back to you.
Would you, Doctor? That would be so kind.
I won't waste your time and Catherine's time bargaining for petty privileges. Clarice Starling and that awful Jack Crawford have wasted far too much already. I only pray they haven't doomed the poor girl... Let me help you now, and I'll trust you when it's all over.
You have my word. Paul?
What...?
Did you breast-feed her?
Yes... I did.
Toughened your nipples, didn't it...? Six foot one, strongly built, about 190 pounds. Hair brown, eyes pale blue. He'd be about 35 now. He said he lived in Philadelphia, but may have lied. That's really all I can remember, Senator - but if I think of any more, I'll let you know.

Let's go with it.
Senator Martin...! You can't trust Jack Crawford or Clarice Starling. It's such a game with these people. They're determined to get the arrest for themselves. The "collar," I think they say.
Thank you, Doctor. I'll keep it in mind.
Thank you, Doctor. I'll keep it in mind.
Oh, and Senator...? Love you suit.
Time, Pilch! My move.
No fair! You lured him with produce.
Of course it counts. How do you play?
Officer Starling. Welcome back.
Your West Virginia specimen gave us quite a bit of trouble, but I finally managed to narrow his species through chaetaxy - studying the skin.
I'm the one who found his perforating proboscis! Are you wearing a gun, right now? Ooh, cool! Can I see it? Can I?

Better known to his friends as the Death's-head Moth...
The Latin name comes from two rivers in Hell. Your man - he drops these girls into rivers, every time. Didn't I read that?
My God, you've grown up.
We leave in the morning?!
We leave in the morning?!
Yes, miss.
Yes, miss.
I won't sleep tonight. What an adventure! I absolutely cannot wait to return to Portman Square, having laid eyes upon the full-blooded, red men in the wild!
Are you alright?
Can we rest soon?
Can we rest soon?
Absolutely.
The men of the regiment will fetch water from the lake, build fires and provide every comfort you desire, Alice...
Duncan, you are absolutely gallant. If Cora doesn't marry you, I shall.
Though they are strangers, they are at least entitled to a Christian burial!
Let us go, miss.
Let us go, miss.
I will not. I have seen the face of war before, Mr. Poe, but never war made on women and children. And almost as cruel is your indifference.
Why didn't you bury those people?
Anyone lookin' to pick up our trail, would see it as a sign of our passing...

Yes. And "do not try to understand them. That is because they are a breed apart and they make no sense..."
The Ottawa are gone.
Why did they turn back?
"We're a breed apart and we make no sense"...?
In your particular case, miss, I would make some allowance...

I do not remember them. I was one or two.

And what were the consequentialities of European culture you didn't bother with?

'Cos frontier land's the only land affordable to poor people. So after seven years indentured service in Virginia, they headed out here where they are beholden to none and not livin' by another's leave... Their name was Cameron. John & Alexandria.
You are right, Mr. Poe. We do not understand what is happening here. And it is not as I imagined it would be, thinking of it in Boston and London...
Sorry to disappoint you...
Sorry to disappoint you...
On the contrary. It is more deeply stirring... to my blood... ...than any imagining could possibly have been...
Much further?
Top of this ridge. Fort and Lake George are downhill of it.
Mr Poe?
Miss. May I?
What are you looking at, Mr. Poe?
Why, I am looking at you, Miss.
They're going to hang you. Why didn't you leave when you had the chance?
Because what I am interested in is right here...
Because what I am interested in is right here...
What would you have me do?
Webb's reinforcements will arrive or not. If they do not arrive, the fort will fall. If that happens, stay close to your father. The French will protect the officer class among the English.
No. I will find you.
No. I will find you.
Do not. Promise me.
What is it?
I don't know. Whatever happens you stay with your father. You stay among the officers.
Are we safe?
Maybe...
Maybe...
Our father? Did you see my father?
In this there is a chance. If I live, I can try to free you. If we don't go, there is no powder, there's too many of them. Though my heart would keep me here, in that there is no chance. None. I can do nothing. Do you understand?
Yes. I want you to go.
Listen. Submit. You hear me? You're strong. You stay alive. I will find you... no matter how far, how long it takes...
...never doubt what you are doing.
And my compliments to you...
Alice?
Will you go back to England?
I have nothing to go back for.
Where will we go?
Winter with the Delaware, my father's cousins. And in the spring, cross the Ohio and look for land to settle with my father in a new place called Can-tuck-ee.
Told you to stay away from this hell hole! Why did you disobey me?
When? How?

There was none!

I sent three men to Webb!
The man encouraged the colonials to desert in this very room, in my presence. He is guilty of sedition and must be tried and hanged like any other criminal, regardless of what he did for my children.
He knew the consequences. And he stayed. Are those the actions of a criminal? ...Duncan, do something.
But the man is guilty of sedition and subject to military justice and beyond pardon.
"Justice"? If that's "justice"..., then the sooner French guns blow the English army out of America, the better it will be for these people.

I'm embarrassed to be so indecisive... after so long apart and after you've traveled so far...
And by sea!

Dear Duncan, my affection is as towards a closest friend. Alice and I depend on you and respect you immensely... I wish they did, but my feelings don't go beyond that. Do you see?
Isn't respect and friendship, a reasonable basis for a man and woman to be joined? And all else may grow in time...?

Cora, in my heart, I know once we're joined, we'll be the happiest couple in England. Let those whom you trust, your father, help settle what's best for you. In view of your indecision, why not rely on their advice and judgment as well as mine?
Will you consider that?
Yes. Yes, I will.
My God, Alice.
It can be dangerous...
One called Magua arrived.
He delivered no such message.
Cora, I adore you and, when we come together, we will be the happiest couple in England... I am certain of that. More than ever before. I believe you must trust the judgment of others who hold your welfare so close to their hearts...
Duncan... Duncan, I promised you an answer. You have complimented me with your persistence and patience... But the decision I've come to is I'd rather make the gravest of mistakes than surrender my own judgment.
I see...
I am sorry, Duncan...
beyond the periphery of men, staring at him.
Munro is expecting him to be the good soldier in defense of British military interests.
He knew the penalty for breaking regulations. He ought to pay without sending you to beg.
You know he wouldn't send me...! You misrepresented what you saw and caused this. I, too, was at that farm. It was as he said...
They do not live their lives "by your leave." ...They hack it out of the wilderness with their own two hands, burying their dead and their children along the way.
You are defending him because you've become infatuated with him.
Yes. Go ahead.
What the bloody hell plan is this?

What are they doing to Duncan? Duncan!
Your wounded should try walkin' back to Albany. They'll never make a passage north.

Where do we go from here?
We don't.
We don't.
I don't understand!

This is it, as far as we can go... If we're lucky, they'll be figurin' we can't have come this way and must've beached our canoes and headed cross land. If we're very lucky, they'll figure we went over the falls.

Got a reason to stay.

Let the children of the dead Colonel Munro go free and take the fire out of the English anger over the murder of their helpless ones.

Wise one, the French fathers made peace and swore to their honor not to break the friendship. Magua broke it. It is false that the French would not be friends, still, to the Huron.
So the Huron are the servants of the French? To do what the French are shamed to do?
No. Huron serve no one. The French father believes he fooled Magua because he is so proud of his cleverness, he is blind. But it is the Huron path that Magua walks down, not the French one... Now, Les Francais, also, fear Huron. That is good. When the Huron is strong from their fear, we will make the terms of trade with Les Francais.
Magua would use the ways of Les Francais and the Yengeese...
The red man put down the bow, picked up the fire stick and became the best warrior in the forest. Yes. It is the only way.

Would the Huron make his Algonquin brothers foolish with brandy and steal his lands to sell them for gold to the white man? Would the Huron have greed for more land than a man can use? Like Francais Black Robes do? Would Huron kill tribes with disease? Would the Huron fool Seneca into taking all the animals in the forest for beads & brandy?
Help ourselves to a few horns from your powder stores.
What else?
A man, here, can make a run straight through to Webb.
...not enough time to get to Albany and back with reinforcements...
Yes, Mr. Poe? So?
It was a war party. It means they're on the attack up and down the frontier.
Many men here, their homes are in the path.
That's all, sir.
That judgment is not more important than their right under agreement with Webb to defend their farms & families... Major Heyward was at John Cameron's. He saw what it was.
What did you see, Major?
I'll have none of that! Montcalm is a soldier and a gentleman. Not a butcher.
Easy for you to suppose. While it is their women and children, not yours, alone in their farms!

You will take command of the 62nd Regiment of Foot. At Fort William Henry under Colonel Munro. I will march the 33rd to Fort Edward.

Yes. You may. You there. What does Munro call you? The "Scotsman" has sent one of his Indian allies to guide you.
The Scotsman's daughters are at the Poltroon's house. A company of the 33rd will accompany you and Magua will show you the way.
By your leave, sir.
Does Webb not even know we are besieged?
Sir. Webb has no idea. And he certainly does not know to send reinforcements!
What happened to you?
Ambush... on the George Road. This Magua led us into it. ...eighteen killed. It's these men who saved us. They guided us here...

Logistics are his guns are bigger than mine and he has more of them. They keep our heads down while his sappers make thirty yards of trench a day.

Webb's not in Albany. He marched the 33rd to Fort Edward two days ago.
Webb's at Edward?
Webb's at Edward?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Only twelve miles away! He could be here day after tomorrow. Find your man, sir! Captain Beams will give you the message.
Things were done. Nobody was spared...
Terrible feature of war in the Americas. Best to keep your sight fixed on our duty.
Not with enough certainty to outweigh British interests in this fort.
And who empowered these provincials to pass judgment upon England's policies in her own colonies? To come and go without so much as a "by your leave."
This is the signature of Webb. And I know the temper of our men. Rather than spend the war in a French prison hulk in Hudson Bay, they'd fight to the end.
You have heard your answer, Monsieur le Marquis.
I have lived to see two things I never expected. An Englishman afraid to support a friend. And a Frenchman too honest to profit by that advantage.
General Webb can burn in hell. We'll go back and dig our graves behind the ramparts! Our mission is to fight.

I must receive proof more conclusive than Mr. Poe's opinion before I weaken our defenses by allowing militia to withdraw.
Chingachgook's of the same opinion. Taken together, that's gospel. Your fort will stand or fall depending on Webb and reinforcements, not these colonials' presence.

That Le Renard has the power to lead his people into the light, I know well.
That's where a lead bullet has torn you.
And this?
My son has been sadly injured. Who did this?
Magua slept hard in the English wigwams. And the sticks left their mark... Magua's village and lodges were burnt. Magua's children were killed by the English. Magua was taken as a slave by the Mohawks who fought for the Grey Hair. Magua's wife believed he was dead and became the wife of another. The Grey Hair was the father of all this. In time

Munro would. But General Webb will not send their soldiers across the salt lake. Having let them go, I fear I will only fight the same men again when I move south. And yet, I cannot break the terms of the capitulation and sully the lilies of France...

Many things my French father cannot do, Magua can.
Colonel Munro, I have known you as a gallant antagonist. I am happy to make your acquaintance as a friend.
And I to make yours, Monsieur le Marquis.
And I to make yours, Monsieur le Marquis.
Please accept my compliments for the strong and skillful defense of your fortress. Under the command of a lesser man it would have fallen long ago given the superior numbers and material... mere chance has allowed me to array against you...

Monsieur le Marquis, I am a soldier, not a diplomat. You called this parlay for a reason.

You have already done everything which is necessary for the honor of your Prince. I will forever bear testimony that your resistance has been gallant and was continued as long as there was hope. But now, I beg you to listen to the admonitions of humanity. I beg you to consider my terms for your surrender.

However I may apprise such testimony from Monsieur Montcalm, Fort William Henry is strong and stands.

Honor that is freely accorded to courage, may be refused obstinacy... These hills afford to us every opportunity to reconnoiter your works and I am possibly as well acquainted with your weak condition as you are yourselves. Is Webb really en route and Montcalm hopes to take the fort by duplicity before British reinforcements arrive?

Perhaps the General's glasses can reach to the Hudson and he knows the size and imminence of the army of Webb...?
Such as...?
My master requires the fort be destroyed. But, for you and your comrades, there is no privilege that will be denied. None of your men will see the inside of a prison barge. They're free to go so long as they return to England and fight no more on this continent, and the civilian militia return to their farms.

Their arms?
Their arms?
They may leave the fortress fully armed, but with no ammunition... Other than that, ask what you wish.
The honors of war?
Granted.
Granted.
My colors?
My colors?
Carry them to England to your King with pride.

Allow me to consult with my officers.
I am deeply touched by such unusual and unexpected generosity... The fort is yours under the condition that we be given until dawn to bury our dead, prepare our men and women for their march and turn our wounded over to your surgeon.
Granted, Monsieur.
Qui vive?
France.
France.
Le mot d'ordre?

Are you planning on working tomorrow?
Well, I'll be on the golf course in the morning. Then, if I don't have any babies to deliver--

We almost had an accident today. DeJesus' suit...
You mind if I take a look at this?
Be my guest.
What do you want me to say? That it all sounds mysterious?
These observers were doing something. A test...I think they sank that ship on purpose to cover up their mistakes.
These observers were doing something. A test...I think they sank that ship on purpose to cover up their mistakes.
What mistakes? Look, I think it's no big deal but if you want to find out why this ship sank have Maritime run a check.
What's wrong?
Pretty good imitation of a hangover and I ought to know.
Dead? This morning you said he had some skin disorder.
He did.
He did.
Well, how the hell does a skin rash kill you in eight hours?!
Here. Put this on. You examine him.
I'm not a doctor.
I'm not a doctor.
For this...you don't need to be.
The mask is because you think it might be...catching?
I don't know. I've been back and forth with Narragansett Naval all day, consulting with the best people in maritime medicine, the best people in viruses...

It could be a million things, something in the air, food.... But he went on that ship and so did Williams... I want to examine the crew.

Yeah...right...
They found this?
No. I think they isolated him in genetic engineering. Homo aquaticus...

It was when it counted a couple of million years ago when the seas came in and drove us into the water. Most homo sapiens didn't make it...Danakil man... <u>adapted</u>.
Some say that's why we're basically hairless, for less water resistance, faster swimming speeds...
But what about those scales... or that leech-like thing that bit Cobb?

Well, if they were perfecting an aquaman, then why's there a dead one onboard that Russian ship? Why isn't he out swimming around?
That it acquires intelligence from its victims?
Intelligence may not be the right word...
Be careful with it.
Don't worry, I don't want to give up any more.
DeJesus! A readout!
He don't need a readout, man, he needs help!
He don't need a readout, man, he needs help!
Stay calm!
Doc eat already?
The good doctor hasn't showed yet.
I've been looking at the duty roster...at the shack hours outstanding...
Uh, oh...I see where this is going...
Uh, oh...I see where this is going...
...all of you owe time and I thought tonight would be a good time to---
Bullshit...I was just talking to him. I saw him move.
What?...
We're getting out of here just in time.
There's now a problem with the weather for pickup. There's a typhoon in our sector... ...We're going to be delayed twelve hours...
It's got Hazy!
What has?
What has?
One of those chunks of Sixpack! Like a big leech, with those teeth!...
I thought they were your friends?
Were, Doss <u>were</u>.
No, it's not going through. The intercom's busted. I thought DeJesus fixed that?
He did.
That's why there's a dead one on the ship. It ran out of blood.
What dead one on the ship?
We don't have much choice... without air, the internal pressure will fall and--
Crunch...Implosion.
Jesus Christ...
Can you fix it?
Can you fix it?
No way...
No way...
Think! Can we stop it?! Block it up?! Shut down the line somewhere?! Think!
Think! Can we stop it?! Block it up?! Shut down the line somewhere?! Think!
I am thinking, man! You think I want to die! I am thinking! I--
I hit it. But I can't see it! Can you see it?!
No.
Go on!
No!
No!
That's an order!
That's an order!
Fuck your orders!
Where the hell've you been?
I got hung up! Try this!
Your suit, Becky!
Just get in yours!
Cobb, Jones, I want you to do something about that damn rattle in the air system... Bowman and Sixpack...living quarters...
Shit...
Shit...
Williams...get DeJesus' suit on the "sick rack" and do a diagnostics. Any other suit problems she should know about?
Look at my foot, sir! This bitch put a goddamn sea monster in my bunk!
How do you know it was Williams?
How do you know it was Williams?
Huh? I...uh...uh...
Huh? I...uh...uh...
All right, Sixpack, you and Williams are gonna pull water duty tomorrow--
You did good...
What?
What?
Today...with DeJesus. That was smart thinking to get him inside...
Today...with DeJesus. That was smart thinking to get him inside...
There probably wasn't anything wrong with his suit...
There probably wasn't anything wrong with his suit...
Still...you did the right thing.
I need more light on that, Four.
Roger... More light, Sixpack...
That's great. Now let's move 35 degrees southwest.
You screw around like that again and--
Sixpack?
Why can't we pick up his signal?
That was a loud one wasn't it?
After a month of it you'd think I'd be used to it.
