It still sounds high.
She had, I believe it was... fifty grand on her, too. There was a cop at the hearing. Young guy with L.A.P.D. wanted her bond set at twenty- five thousand, saying there was a risk of flight. Jackie being a stewardess and all.

Very first motherfuckin' thing they did. They see I put up a big money bond on my boy, they start thinking with that where-there's-smoke-there's fire logic. They roust my ass outta bed, ten o'clock in the morning. Fuckin' scare my woman, Sherona, half to death. She thought they were gonna take my ass away for sure.

That's what the police thought. I told them I'm unemployed, how could I have anybody work for me? Now I bail out Jackie, I'm liable to have the police on me again, huh? Wanting to know was she doing things for me, was she bringing me that money!

You want me to speculate on what you do. I'd say you're in the drug business, except the money's moving in the wrong direction. Whatever you're into, you seem to be getting away with it, so more power to you. Okay you want another bond, and you want to move over the ten thousand you put down on Beaumont to the stewardess. That means

That's why she's givin' up my money huh? Not that bullshit about Melanie. I didn't trust her ass neither, but I knew how to handle her. She was my blonde-headed little surfer gal.

I don't know. I've been having them recently. You know, you look like an angel, Louis, an overgrown cherub. Anyone ever tell you that?
Yeah. You. Every time I see you. No more Errol Flynn, okay? Your back won't take it. You tell your girl friend to calm down if she knows what's good for you.

Half an hour from now and you'll be walking out of here all by yourself. Mark my words. Well, you've done it to yourself this time, haven't you?

You ever read Meister Eckart? How did you ever get your Doctorate without reading Eckart? Good. Okay, let's turn over gently. Right side.
Perfect. We got it. Okay. Let's just give it a little try. See if you can stand.
What? By myself?

Oh, that goes way back. They had a hiring freeze, one of those last min- ute things. Bad timing for me though. Middle of the war. The draft. I'll tell you Prof, after Viet Nam ... I didn't want to think anymore. I decided my brain was just too small an organ to comprehend this chaos.

I doubt it's my mind that interests her. I tell you Prof, she's a fiery lady.
Well, try not to get burned. You have a great mind, Jacob. Don't let anyone tempt you away from it.
I've got a problem, Prof. More Augus- tine than Kierkegaard, if you know what I mean. I need to know about ... demons.
Demons, Jacob? Why demons? Are you writing ... ?
Demons, Jacob? Why demons? Are you writing ... ?
No. I see them.
No. I see them.
See them? What do you mean? Physically?
See them? What do you mean? Physically?
Yes.
I know very little about demons, Ja- cob, fleshy ones anyway. I know them as literary figures, biblical ones ... Dante, Milton ... but Jacob, this is the 20th Century. We don't see demons now.
I see them, Prof. Everywhere. They're invading my life.
Christ, I know how it sounds.
Have you considered a doctor? A psy- chiatrist?
Have you considered a doctor? A psy- chiatrist?
Yes. I don't want them. I'm not looking for analysis or drugs. It's too easy to dismiss as some kind of psychosis. It's more than that. I can feel it. I need you Prof. You're the only one I can talk to.
Yes. I don't want them. I'm not looking for analysis or drugs. It's too easy to dismiss as some kind of psychosis. It's more than that. I can feel it. I need you Prof. You're the only one I can talk to.
I don't know what to say.
I don't know what to say.
I need your insight, your intuition.
Demons? I don't know what to tell you. It sounds like a spiritual mat- ter to me. The problem, Jacob, is that you have no context for it. You're a renegade Existentialist suf- fering demons a hundred years after Freud. How the hell am I supposed to make it fit?
I'm afraid, Prof. Nothing makes sense. Please help me.
I'm afraid, Prof. Nothing makes sense. Please help me.
Jacob, I don't believe in demons, not in the empirical sense. I don't be- lieve in devils fighting for our souls. I don't believe in enternal damnation. I don't believe in other- worldly creatures tormenting us. We don't need them. We do a good enough job on ourselves.

Look. I don't pretend to know what's going on inside your head. For all I know it's pathological and they should be pumping Valium into your veins by the quart. But if you're not willing to accept the help of sci- ence; and believe me, I admire you for that: then you'll have to do bat- tle on your own. What can I say?

I'venever understood you, you know that? You were by far the best pupil I've ever had, bar none. Intellectu- ally, you were the most original, the most imaginative. Who knows, maybe you've been "elected" to see demons. Maybe you're in touch with ... some- thing. Nothing would surprise me about you Jacob. Nothing.
I'd like to speak to Dr. Carlson, please.
Carlson? Is he new here?
Carlson? Is he new here?
New? He's been here for years.
Not according to my charts. Do you have an appointment?

If this is an emergency we have a staff of psychiatric social workers. There's about an hour's wait. I'll be glad to take your name. Why don't you just fill out this form?

I don't want to know.
I don't want to know.
Jezebel, from the post office. You remember, you met her that time at the Christmas party. I was living with her. God, it was a nightmare. There were all these demons and I was on fire. Only I was burning from ice.

Jacob, what can I do?
Save me!
My back. I can't move. I need my chiropractor.
Your back? Did you fall?

We better get an orthopedic man in here. Is Dr. Davis on call?
I'm going to have to move you a bit, just to check for injuries. This may hurt a little.
No. Don't move me.
I don't have to ask if you can feel that.

Am I home?
Am I home?
You're here. Home. The doctor said you're lucky your brains didn't boil. What a night, Jake. It was crazy. You kept sayin' "Sarah, close the window," over and over. And talkin' to your kids. Even the dead one. Weird. You know you melted 200 pounds of ice in 8 hours. Amazing, huh?

Are we in Brooklyn?
You're right here, Jake. You just rest. The doctor said you had a virus. That's what they say when they don't know what it is. You can't do anything for a week. He says you gotta recuperate. Now you just lie here. Mrs. Sandelman made you some chicken soup. It'll warm you up.
You know, you really ought to get out today. You can't just sit around like this all the time. It's not healthy. It's not good for your mind. Go take a walk, or somethin'. Go to a movie. Christ, who's gonna know? You think I care? I don't give a shit. Go. Enjoy yourself. One of us should be having a good time. Hello!
What?
Look, I'm horny. Keep it in mind. Love me a little?
You are the most unbelievable woman I have ever met. One second you're a screaming banshee and the next you're Florence Nightingale. Who are you? That's what I want to know. Will the real Jezzie Pipkin please stand up.
So tell me ... am I still an angel?
With wings. You transport me, you know that? You carry me away.

In a way. At least now I have some idea of what was happening. If we can only get them to admit ... to explain what they did ... I don't know. Maybe it'd clear things up in my head. I'll tell you something, Jez, honestly ... I thought they were real.
I put a frozen dinner in the oven, a Manhandler. It'll be ready at a quarter of. I threw a little salad together. It's in the fridge. I also bought some apple juice, Red Cheek. Don't drink it all. Oh, and Jake, your lawyer called.
He did? When?

Baby, I'm sorry. I feel terrible. I'd stay and talk but I'm so late. Look, don't be upset. We'll talk when I get home. See you around midnight. Bye. And don't brood. Watch T.V. or something.
It's just me.

You wanna know? Turn on the T.V. Watch the fucking news!
Why are you doing this to me? You can't just go away like that.

I'm not here. You haven't seen me.

Hello ... No. He's not here. I haven't seen him all night ... I don't know when ... What? Tell him what? Vietnam? ... What experiments?

How do you know he's telling the truth?
What are you doing here? Are you all right? How do you expect to pay for this? Everyone's looking for you, Jake. I dodged people all over the place, reporters, police. I don't know what you're gonna do.
I'm gonna make love to you. That's what I'm gonna do.

What's gotten into you?
It's amazing, you know, that a drug could change things like that, destroy a life and then give it back. It's hard to believe that the world could be so hellish on day and like heaven the next.
I tell you, it was so wonderful. I felt like a little boy. I saw Paradise, Jezzie.
I tell you, it was so wonderful. I felt like a little boy. I saw Paradise, Jezzie.
It's so hard to believe.
This is one of my dreams, Jake. Ever since I was a little girl. I never thought it would happen.
Stick with me, kid.
I want to go with you, Jake. Wherever you go.
It's not practical, Jez. It'll be hard enough alone.

Where have they gone?
Where have they gone?
Wake up. Stop playing with yourself. It's finished.
What's going on?
Your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, Dr. Singer.
What's wrong, Jake? Forget to take your antidote?
Who are you? What are you doing to me?
Who are you? What are you doing to me?
You have quite a mind, Jake. I loved your friends. That chemist - the Ladder. What an imagination you have!
WHO ARE YOU?
How many times have you asked me that? How many times?
How many times have you asked me that? How many times?
TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
YOU KNOW WHO I AM.
So tell me ... am I still an angel?
With wings. You transport me, you know that? You carry me away.
It's going to be all right, Jake. It's going to be all right. Don't be afraid. I've got you now.
Hold me, Jezzie. Hold me.
Why won't you answer me?
Cause you know goddamn well who I am.
Cause you know goddamn well who I am.
I don't know you.

You've lived with me for two years.

Well leave then. Go to Hell.
Well leave then. Go to Hell.
You son-of-a-bitch. Who do you think you are? I don't deserve this. Who takes care of you day and night? Who cleans the floor and washes your goddamn underwear? Well, I've had it. You flip out on your own, you ungrateful bastard. I'm done holding your hand. I don't want anything to do with you, you hear? Nothing!
What'd you do that for? It's an in- teresting story. All these people are still disappearing. Right off the street. Hey, what's wrong? Are you all right?
I'm okay. I just don't want to lis- ten.
I'm okay. I just don't want to lis- ten.
You look upset.

Oh God!
What's wrong, Jake? Forget to take your antidote?
What's wrong, Jake? Forget to take your antidote?
Goddamn you!
Goddamn you!
I loved your chemist, Jake. The height of fantasy. And your vision of paradise. A most romantic creation. You're quite a dreamer, Jake. Only it's time to wake up.
WHO ARE YOU?
How many times have you asked me that? How many times?
How many times have you asked me that? How many times?
TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
You know who I am.
Surprised, huh? I told you you'd know me. I've been tracking you for a long time. I just wish I'd spoken to you before tonight.
I don't get it. Who are you? Why have you been following me?
I don't get it. Who are you? Why have you been following me?
Observation, mainly. Clinical study. You were one of the survivors.
So first I'm arrested, right? Best LSD I ever made, right down the drain. I figure this is it, twenty years in the joint, if I'm lucky. That was '68.
Long time ago.
Long time ago.
Next thing I know I'm on Rikers Island. Ever been there? Suddenly they take me from my cell to the visitors room with those bank teller windows, you know. Four army colonels, medals up their asses, are standing on the other side. They tell me if I'll come to Vietnam for two years, no action, mind you, just work in a lab, they'll drop

Shows how much you knew.
Shows how much you knew.
No shit. They had me by the balls. Next thing I know I'm in Saigon ... in a secret lab synthesizing mind- altering drugs. Not the street stuff mind you. They had us isolating special properties. The dark side, you know? They wanted a drug that increased aggressive tendencies.

Yeah, sure. We were losing the war.
Yeah, sure. We were losing the war.
Right. They were worried. They figured you guys were too soft. They wanted something to stir you up, tap into your anger, you know? And we did it. The most powerful thing I ever saw. Even a bad trip, and I had my share, never compared to the fury of the Ladder.

The Ladder?
The Ladder?
That's what they called it. A fast trip right down the ladder. Right to the primal fear, the base anger. I'm tellin' you, it was powerful stuff. But I don't need to tell you. You know.
Anyway, this big offensive was coming up. Everyone knew it; Time Magazine, Huntley-Brinkley. And the brass was scared 'cause they knew we couldn't win. Morale was down. It was gettin' ugly in the States. Hell, you remember.
Like it was yesterday.
Like it was yesterday.
A couple days later they decided to use the Ladder, on one test battalion. Yours. Just in an infintessimal dose in the food supply, to prove its effectiveness in the field. They were sure your unit would have the highest kill ratio in the whole goddamn offensive. And you did, too. But not the way they tnought.
None of us can remember that night. I get flashes of it but they don't make sense. We saw shrinks for years. But nothing they did could ever touch it. What happened? Was there ever an offensive?
A couple of days later. It was fierce. You guys never saw it.
A couple of days later. It was fierce. You guys never saw it.
But there was an attack. I can still see them coming. There was a fight, wasn't there?
But there was an attack. I can still see them coming. There was a fight, wasn't there?
Yeah. But not with the Cong.
Yeah. But not with the Cong.
Who then?
I always suspected the effects might come back. That's why I had to follow you. I had a hell of a time getting hold of your records.
If you knew, why didn't you say anything?
If you knew, why didn't you say anything?
The truth can kill, my friend. Five hundred men died out there. This isn't a story they'd ever want out. When Paul's car blew up I realized the scope of the thing. I knew they meant business.

So why tell me now?
So why tell me now?
Because I can get rid of the demons. I can block the Ladder. I have an antidote. We can kill them off, chemically speaking. They'll all disappear. It's chemistry, my friend. I know. I created it. Come with me. I can help.
You come here often?
Sometimes. When it's convenient.

How do I know this isn't just some kind of, you know, seduction or something?
How do I know this isn't just some kind of, you know, seduction or something?
Hey, I'm not the problem. You've got bigger problems than me.
I came up with the formula back in Nam but I never got a chance to use it.
Never?
Never?
I'd hoped I'd never have to. Just open your mouth and stick out your tongue.

I don't know.

"Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I shall fear no evil," but no one ever said I wouldn't be shittin' in my pants every step of the way, huh? Stick out your tongue. That'a boy. Now why don't you just lie down and relax.

One drop?
One drop?
It's strong stuff.
I think I'm falling asleep.
Pleasant dreams.
I can't move.
Just relax.
Just relax.
What's happening? Help me.
And no more demons. I told you they'd be gone.
I don't believe this. It's a miracle, Michael. A miracle.
I don't believe this. It's a miracle, Michael. A miracle.
Better living through chemistry, that's my motto.
It was paradise, Michael. You showed it to me. You were there.
Well that's good to know.
Well that's good to know.
Mike, it was real. It was glorious.
Mike, it was real. It was glorious.
Glorious. I'm not surprised. I fed you enough of that stuff to send a horse to heaven. I'm just glad you came back.

I'm sure. You've got nothing but troubles waitin' for you here.
Here. I've got every credit card ever printed. Take this. Stay here till you can arrange to get away. It's on me.
No. I couldn't.
No. I couldn't.
What? You want the Plaza? Don't be foolish. Here. Take this, too. This is my place on Prince Street. It's got my phone, everything. Call if you need me ... but you won't. Everything's gonna work out. You just get outta town as fast as you can. The New York police can be effective when they want to be.

Excuse me, do you know if we've passed Nostrand Avenue yet? Excuse me. Look, I'm asking a simple question. Have we hit Nostrand Avenue? I fell asleep.
I no from around here.

They're awfully heavy.

I know. That's why I'm asking.
Where's Wong?
That's what I'd like to know. If you see him on the street somewhere, tell him he's fired.
How was Palm Springs?
Hot. Where do I sign?
Hot. Where do I sign?
You got a nice tan, though.

Tan? What tan? It faded on the airplane. I'd try to get my money back, but who do you ask? Two hundred dollars a night, for what?
No. I'll take the other one. Right. Well it's good to have you back. See you tomorrow, probably.

They've been followin' me. They're comin' outta the walls. I don't trust anyone. I'm not even sure I trust you. But I gotta talk to someone. I'm gonna fly outta my fuckin' mind.

She said I haven't been the same since then. Since that night. There's still this big hole in my brain. It's so dark in there, Jake. And these creatures. It's like they're crawling out of my brain. What happened that night? Why won't they tell us?

I don't know. I don't know.
They're monsters, Jake. We're both seein' 'em. There's gotta be a connection. Something.
I'm afraid to go by myself anymore. I keep thinkin' one of 'em's gonna come up behind me. Somethin's wrong when a guy can't even take a leak by himself. I've seen 'em take people right off the street. I used to go home a different way every night. Now I can't even go home.
You come home with me.
You come home with me.

You got lucky. I could have waited until he ate your head.
Speaking of which, duck!
That sucks. Why won't he go down?
Pause play.
He's not part of the program.
Hey cool. They brought ancient hockey guy back to life.
Asshole that does not count as a kill.
Yes it does.
Yes it does.
Oh, come on!
Okay, enough of this shit.
Alright, asshole.
I don't have all day, kid.
Yeah yeah I better call the labs, see what the hell is going on.
Duck fuckers?
He's either unconcious or playing dead, whichever, he ain't really dead. Okay, you know , that's it for me. I'm outta here.
Forget the bridge, the shuttle's waiting!
What do you mean, not enough time?
Just make a break for the door. He'll get some of us, but that's the breaks.
We're not leaving Crutch!
We're not leaving Crutch!
We don't have time to argue!
Goodbye old friend.
Okay, he was a great guy, now let's move out.
Okay, he was a great guy, now let's move out.
Could you show a little compassion?!
It's locked!
Then break it! If you don't pull it, the ship's going to depressurize!
What are you doing?!!
If the ship goes, so does Jaso.
If the ship goes, so does Jaso.
Rizzo pull the fucking lever!
Rizzo pull the fucking lever!
No.
What's that?
THat's the sound of deep space attacking the integrity of the ship.
When the left hull goes, so will the right.
What if we blow the walkways first? Leave Jason over here to go up with the ship?
We can't lead him into the other hull!
We don't have a choice!
Can we blow it with just two?
If we don't sever the hull completely she'll drag us down with her.
His mother?
What?
What?
I don't know. Nothing.
Minimal.
We made it?
The ship's depressurizing, the engines overheating. When it reaches the core, we're done.
Done?
Hurry up, guys. We've got the rescue ship on radar.
Delongpre! Out of time!
Remember, stay calm, use your thrusters. We'll be fine.
Why wouldn't we be. I mean, look around. So far so good.
Damnit to hell, you left me back there to die!
Sergeant? We thought you were...
Sergeant? We thought you were...
Yeah, yeah. Well, what have you got to say for yourself?
Bomb?
Explosive. We're blowing the walkway.
Blowing the walkway? You come up with that yourself?
Rizzo did.
Can't shut em' down from here.
Somebody's gonna have to go back to the engine room.
Sergeant!
Get out of here!
Uh-oh.
What?!
What?!
Kkinsa! Open the doors!
Okay that hurt.
Thorgan, pull us in.
Where have you been?!!
He....He...
Where the hell were you?!!
He came for me, I had to run!
Creepy.
Cool.
Nice touch.
And you said high school was boring.
You see that?
Briggs, Geko, movement beyond the boxed fuselage.
Better let me.
Where'd you get the gun?
Everyone okay?
I think I broke my arm.
Shit!
The hull's imploding!
The hull's imploding!
Rizzo! Can you hear me?!
We're not supposed to do that.
What are you gonna do, tell me?
I'll need system four converters.
They're back here.
Hey! I'm not ready.
Then you better hurry. I'll blow alley one, Delongpre, you and Rizzo take there. Janessa you ready two and we'll meet up there.
Thorgan, quit screwing around and come on!
I'm coming, I'm coming.
Kay-Em!
What are you doing back?!!
As long as they're connected we can blow them all simultaneously from a safe distance.
Two more charges to go.
Done!
Let's move out!
Goodbye, my love.
Thorgan, suit up.
Thorgan, suit up.
This is gonna work. If he sticks to the program. Will he? Stick to the program?
Brodski! Get to Lab two. We have an emergency!
Er, guys. Where's the Hockey Player?
We'd need charges.
We could convert fission transistors.
How many?
Bring 'em all. Let's move!
I think I speak on behalf of the group when I say this is bad news.
Thorgan? You coming?!
Where is...?
You tell me! She's only set one charge. And it's not finished!
I'd say we have about ten minutes tops.
Then stop talking and work faster!
Then what do we do?!
I don't know!
Hurry!
Faster! Don't we have another gun?
It bought us some time.
And now we're all out of it.
Earth II.
Suit up.
Boeman, the ships not here.
Use the thrusters and you'll be fine. We'll huddle together out there.
Use the thrusters and you'll be fine. We'll huddle together out there.
Hey, easy now.
Get them in the lab!
Not so fast Yllo! There's a protocol here.
My god! This is way over your head, pal. We need to call some experts and . . .
I am an expert!
I am an expert!
You're a teacher.
You're a teacher.
Brodski I'll talk slow so you can understand me. She's thawing. If we don't get her to the lab, she'll die, and that will be on your bald fucking head!
Brodski I'll talk slow so you can understand me. She's thawing. If we don't get her to the lab, she'll die, and that will be on your bald fucking head!
What if they're carrying? Did you even check?
How do you know that piece of cursed rock down there doesn't carry something metal tits can't detect?
Well, when we rejuvenate this one you can ask her.
Well, when we rejuvenate this one you can ask her.
Damnit, Yllo! I don't like it.
Damnit, Yllo! I don't like it.
I don't give a shit. This one's prime for decryonization. We're brining her back.
I don't give a shit. This one's prime for decryonization. We're brining her back.
I still think we should send for a team of real scientists.
I still think we should send for a team of real scientists.
I am a scientist you asshole! This could be the most important discovery in 400 years. Do you have any idea what a find like this could mean?
I am a scientist you asshole! This could be the most important discovery in 400 years. Do you have any idea what a find like this could mean?
Right now, I care only for the safety of this crew. You don't know anything about these two -
Jesus what the hell is that?
That's exactly what we need to find out. Check your orders, Sergeant. I out rank you where discovery is concerned. Now step aside. I have a medical emergency to deal with.
What the hell are you doing?
My job.
My job.
Fine, just stay out of my way. Hit it.
Wait a minute...I need...
Give it a rest Yllo. She needs some time.
Yllo, what's your head count?
Looks like we're missing two. Stone and Kkinsa.
ALL I'm saying is dock with Space Lab, couple of hours no more. Let them take a look at our friends.
Not a chance.
Not a chance.
JUst don't go in there half cocked. You guys have a tendency to blow shit up and ask questions later.
JUst don't go in there half cocked. You guys have a tendency to blow shit up and ask questions later.
You got that right.
Got it! Let's move out girls. Yllo go to Lab two and cover out backs.
At least try to get him alive...will ya Brodski?
Yeah, I got ya. I don't see anything inside though.
You just keep an eye out.
You just keep an eye out.
Yeah yeah. Got it.
Ok Sarge, what's your status?
wHAT'S My status?! I've lost three men and your worthless fuck! After I kill this asshole I'm coming your Yllo!
wHAT'S My status?! I've lost three men and your worthless fuck! After I kill this asshole I'm coming your Yllo!
But I didn't see...
Sergeant!
What?
I'm with you kid.
Where is he?
Where is he?
Lab two, relax. What's the matter? He's dead.
Lab two, relax. What's the matter? He's dead.
No, you're dead! You're all dead!
He's dead. They're both dead. You don't understand what is on this ship. This is a being that kills. That's what he does. That's all he does. And he is very good at it.
Kicker, Sven. Get into the grid and tell me what the hell is going on!
I doubt that. I think we can handle whatever your ancient hockey player can throw at us.
Look! Just get everyone together, get off the ship... and then blow it to kingdom fucking come! That's the only way you're going to live.
I need to know what you know about this guy.
Don't go out there. You can't win. We need to get off this ship. That's all there is to it.
Don't go out there. You can't win. We need to get off this ship. That's all there is to it.
Not an option. I'm going to hunt this son of a bitch down.
We need weapons.
Weapons? All this technology and what good has it done?!
Jesus, God!
Oh man, what the hell happened?
Report to weapons. We're going on a hunt.
Roger that. Time to kick some ass!
You sumbitch! Three dead! On my watch! If that...that thing is out there, it's dead! You got it!!!
Fuckin A...
Fuckin A...
Now get out of our way...get back to the lab and baby sit your snot nosed brats... we've got a job to do!
Kicker, anything?
Negative.
Jesus, Sarge, what is this thing?
Teach! Where the hell are you?! Where's our visuals?!!
Where is everybody? What happened?
Damnit! You scared the hell out of me!
Damnit! You scared the hell out of me!
Give me a break! What happened?
Give me a break! What happened?
Jason. He's what happened. Then Grendel hit Space Lab.
Jason. He's what happened. Then Grendel hit Space Lab.
Space Lab?! Wait'll I get my hands on Yllo.
Space Lab?! Wait'll I get my hands on Yllo.
Yllo's dead. We...we thought you were too.
Yllo's dead. We...we thought you were too.
Takes more than a steelbalde to take this old dog down.
Pull me in!
I'm pulling, damnit!
Where are you going?
We have to get off this ship.
You just need to relax. Rizzo ti's the future. We have soldiers on board, E-X Grunts, the baddest of the bad...and their weapons? I'm sure are slightly more advanced than what you're used to.
I hope so.
Outta here?
Isn't there an escape POD on this ship? Something?
Rizzo, he's out there.
Yeah and he'll be here soon enough. Last chance.
Well, I'm not hanging out here with Ms. Showtunes.
Guys!!! The shuttle?
Don't just stand there! Shoot him!
No you don't!
Kkinsa, open the goddamn door!
Yeah, that's it, scare the hell out of here, that'll work.
Kkinsa, Crutch is hurt! We need access to the shuttle's med-kit or he'll die.
Med-kit?
Med-kit?
I guessed.
We're screwed!
400 years in the future and these pea-shooters are the best you can do?!
What if you miss?
What if we don't?
Rizzo?!
It's better this way. If we were rescued Jason would just get off the ship. You want him on your precious Earth II?
Hey.
That's a good fantasy, though. Kinky, but good.
That's a good fantasy, though. Kinky, but good.
Hey!!
What's this?
It's the engine, reactors, audiometers, it's the stuff that makes the ship go zoom.
That's why I'm here.
So, you thought you'd be cool. Go against your father's wishes? Yeah, that's grown up.
My father's company imports and exports. Archaeology is part of the business. We happen to get along just fine, smartass. Look, why don't you bust somebody else's balls for a change.
I thought you meant...
I thought you meant...
You thought I meant...too tough to apologize, huh? You must have been a very lonely girl.
Jason seemed to have the right stuff. Physically, anyway. Radiation, cell damage, didn't matter. He just kept going.
Were you close to your father?
They were all wrong. They couldn't control him.
And what happend to ...?
I couldn't save them.
Well, we'd be dead without you. You know that, don't you?
See? We're not so bad.
Not so bad.
You know, this future shit sucks. I'll fucking do it.
You?
You?
Wait around on your asses all day. I'll need a distraction.
Got it. You ever space walked?
Oh sure, all the time.
His mother was killed before his eyes. That's what drove him insane. It'll work.
That sounds like Rizzo having faith in some of that future shit.
That sounds like Rizzo having faith in some of that future shit.
Eat me.
You wanna release your air tanks?
Okay, good tip.
Okay, good tip.
You'll be fine.
Rizzo, you okay?
No I'm not okay! I don't know what the hell I'm doing!
No I'm not okay! I don't know what the hell I'm doing!
You're doing fine. I won't let anything happen to you, remember?
Rizzo, did they have chinese food in your time?
I think I had some when I was eight.
I think I had some when I was eight.
Did you like it?
Did you like it?
I think so, why?
Delongpre, you don't even know me.
I know you.
Rizzo, pull away!
I'm stuck!
You okay?!
Oh great...yeah, having a great time, and you?
Oh great...yeah, having a great time, and you?
No thank you, you crazy old woman.
No thank you, you crazy old woman.
Old woman?
Old woman?
Well I mean, technically you are old enough to be my great, great, great...
Well I mean, technically you are old enough to be my great, great, great...
I get it.
Now what?
We wait. I need about fifteen. Call me if there are any changes. If she farts I want a full report.
It's time.
What about the others? Shouldn't we wait?
What about the others? Shouldn't we wait?
I've waited long enough. Kay . . . you know what to do.
Spunky . . .
She broke my fucking nose!
Well?
She needs a little time.
She needs a little time.
More time...shit, she's had 400 years...
That's really funny.
I'd want her statements before we reach porch. Jesus, women.
I'd want her statements before we reach porch. Jesus, women.
Yeah, like you'd be a rock after everything she went through?
God damnit! Will you stop doing that?!
Oh I like her a lot.
Shut up! She just wants this thing dead!
No shit. I got no problem with that.
We must assume the machete was an intricate part of the game of hockey.
I'm thinking Rizzo was right.
I'm thinking Rizzo was right.
Thinking with your dick again, Delongpre?
Thinking with your dick again, Delongpre?
Maybe we should go with them. Like you said, your Space Lab connections can deal with this thing. At least we'll be safe.
Maybe we should go with them. Like you said, your Space Lab connections can deal with this thing. At least we'll be safe.
They are not going anywhere. I cut power to the shuttle.
Now hold on! We should hear her out!
She's obviously dealt with this guy before.
Yuck.
We're screwed.
Go-go-go-go-go!!!!
He's right behind us!
I feel better. Now how do you fire this damn thing?
Just go! I've a feeling he's right behind us!
It's on the table where I left it! What the hell are you doing?! Hurry up!
I'm on my way.
Kaboom.
Again?! Jesus!
Okay?!!
Just come on, I've got an idea.
I'll help you in.
Kay-Em, you've saved our lives, you know that don't you?
Oh, shit. He's going to see us.
Well, do something!
He's trying to ask you out on a date.
Shut up, Thorgan!
Push off toward us.
Forget her, she's a pain in the ass. Let her hang there.
I...I don't know what I did...
You lost the charge?
You lost the charge?
He was chasing me!
They're not gonna make it. Close the door before he gets us all.
They'll make it.
They'll make it.
Close the fucking door!
Close the fucking door!
NO!
And what's with the headgear?
The mask is an artifact from a sport outlawed in twenty-twelve.
Now that's just gross.
GO, GO, GO!
Now this is getting exciting.
Remember to roll his balls around a bit.
You must shut down the engines.
Then do it. The rescue ship can find us here right?
I knew you were a little sick, but Geez.
I get no kick from champaign, mere alcohol doesn't faze me at all, but I get a kick out of you.
I'm missing two!
Shit! Temp's dropping! We should have left this rock an hour ago!
Hey teach! This rock's starting to freeze! Get your ass back hre!
Keep your shirt on! I'm working on it. You won't believe what we found. Adrienne! Stoney!
Oh my God . . . what the hell is . . .
Just get us to the ship!
Fat Lou, we're changing courses for the Solaras Space Lab.
I'll need the sergeant's okay on that.
I'll need the sergeant's okay on that.
We've got a situation here! Just do as you're told!
We've got a situation here! Just do as you're told!
Alright, relax. 20 minutes. Soon as we've passed Tara's rings we'll make the course correction.
Alright, relax. 20 minutes. Soon as we've passed Tara's rings we'll make the course correction.
Thank you.
This is what it means right here.
Small brains make your balls itch?
I'm gonna spew.
That ought'a help the situation.
You think it killed . . . Yeah, I guess not.
Let's just get out of here.
Hurry! She's lost it!
So what else is new?
You read a lot of Science Fiction didn't you?
A little late to be thinking about escape, isn't it?
YeaH, GREAT IDEA! And I'll keep the big guy distracted with a blow job.
Would you?
You're so bossy.
You're leaving me here alone?
You're quicker than usual.
Later.
Later.
You prefer an apple?
Jesus!
Oh my God! Adrienne?
Look ice chip, why don't you just chill out and let us handle this?
Try to calm down. Just think, you're going to be famous!
What are you doing?
Jesus! Can't you knock? Diminish power to shutttle Beowulf.
What do we do?!!
Crutch?
I'll tell you where he is. He's walking around this ship, killing anything that moves.
Maybe she tripped.
Boeman don't. You know I'm right.
Are you crazy?! Pull the lever!
No.
Teleportation? Some way to beam us the hell out of dodge?
Any connection between your reality and mine is purely coincidental.
I'm just saying.
I'm just saying.
Come on. You got all these gadgets and shit. Why can't we get inside the right hull, seal up the doors and blow the walkways?
I don't know...sorry?
Sergeant, we could use a big bomb.
Robot huh?

I'm afraid I cannot assist.
I'm surrounded by idiots.
You need to get laid!
No... That's the sound of the men working on the chain gang.
Are there any other shuttles?
Sumbitch won't be giving us anymore trouble.
You killed him?
You killed him?
Blew half his skull away, one leg, one arm and left his entrails stretched across the lab. And look at me! I'm covered in his filthy blood!
The air's laced with type two ozone, it reads as a solid.
Somebody wanted the place to stay hidden.
Somebody wanted the place to stay hidden.
In twenty-eighty-two many of the survivors moved their facilities underground to escape . . .
The cryo unit leaked. The computers sealed the room. No airborne viruses no hazardous materials. I've shut down the until. Alright, stand back.
Hold your breath. Initial cryo gasses will render you unconcious.
I didn't say I was good at it.
Oh shit! There he is!
I'll never experience my fantasy of three sex droids, two humans, and a Knofflapod. Damn.
Am I in there?
Am I in there?
Sory...
It's just you and me, then.
Come here, might as well fix that arm.
Almost done.
Ow!
Ow!
Oh, hush. I disengaged your pain programming.

Sometimes I just wish I had a kitten.
Sorry, sorry.
Who are you apologizing to?

Good point.
Do I have to?
Yes, I've reprogrammed you. You are very brave. Bad ass.
Yes, I've reprogrammed you. You are very brave. Bad ass.
Oh, alright.
Kay-Em, you okay?
Don't worry about me. I live for this shit.
You did good, Kay-Em. I'm proud of you.
A real mamma's boy that one. Dissed his mamma and he nearly threw a tantrum. Little good it did him.
Kay-Em we made it!
Oh, goody. I'm so pleased. I'd clap if I could.
Kay-em you okay?
I am now. I missed you, Thorgan.
I am now. I missed you, Thorgan.
I missed you too.
I missed you too.
I love you.
Yo, Teach, what the fuck?
We're missing two of the kids!
We're missing two of the kids!
Get your ass back to the shuttle. I'll check it out.
Fat Lou, bring the ship to the following coordinates. Call Grendel, have them power up the labs, we're bringing in the find of the century!
Now wait a minute! I don't think you should open that door.
Now wait a minute! I don't think you should open that door.
This is a science excursion corporal. Just stay out of the way.
Kicker!
Defense droids. I'm on it.
Leave him behind!
No! He's coming with us!
I don't understand...what does he want?
He wants to kill you...and me...and everyone on this ship.
What?
Ssh.
How do you know?
I just know.
Something's wrong.
Keep trying!
The power's back up!
Then open the doors!
Then open the doors!
Thirty seconds.
Damn! Close the door! I'll be right back.
What?!!
What?!!
I gotta go back.
I gotta go back.
But?!!
You son of a bitch, you know what time it is?
We just left old Earth. You'll never believe what we found.
I'm sending you the files.
Yeah, yeah if this is another ancient Farrari . . .

Trust me. I'm bypassing regular channels. See what kind of payday we're looking at.
Alright, I'm . . . No way . . . is this a joke?
Hypothetically, how much are we talking?
If you're for real, you're looking at a million credits for viewing rights alone. Doesn't include touring and guest lectures. When can you get them here?

JASON?! WHERE IS HE?!
We need to do some tests...I'd like to ask you a few questions.
But...I...400 years?
But...I...400 years?
That's right, now if you could...
Jason? He's on this ship?!
Of course he is. He's the most relevant find in 400 years...except for you, of course. Look if you're worried about PR don't be. You're walking and talking. He's a stiff. You'll get the publicity.
Of course he is. He's the most relevant find in 400 years...except for you, of course. Look if you're worried about PR don't be. You're walking and talking. He's a stiff. You'll get the publicity.
Are you finished?
Jason! Can't you see? He did this.
Impossible! He was dead before he entered Cryo-statis. There is no possible way he could be alive.
Impossible! He was dead before he entered Cryo-statis. There is no possible way he could be alive.
I didn't say he was alive.
Azrael can you repeat that?
Get him out of there!
That's ridiculous. You're overreacting.
Why don't you get it? He's going to kill us all!
You're not going anywhere.
You wanna die?

Are we locked down?
What good will that do?
They can deal with this sort of thing.

So, you're saying thse guys have like, lasers and stuff? They could hack him to pieces?
Exactly.
Yes!
Listen up duck fuckers, you can't kill this thing.
Listen to me. Please. Let's get off thsi ship. Come with me.
Rizzo, a shuttle out in the middle of space? We'll die oout there.
Can we get through these?
Sure but what good will that do?
Guys, he's right behind us!
It's okay.
Cut my hand. Hit by a vampire.
On the swing? I told you not to play near there until I sanded it down. See what your son did?

He's from the Oceanographic Institute.
Hey. Knock it off. I don't want to have to listen to this while we're out there...
What do you mean 'We...?'

It's my charter. My party.

Keep that chum line going -- we've got five good miles. Don't break it.
Who's driving the boat?
Who's driving the boat?
Nobody. We're drifting with the current.
Why are we way out here, when the shark's back there?
...'cause this is where he lives. You gotta think like they do.
You got it?
Get behind me, dummy! Reverse her and turn -- he's taking too much line! Wet my reel, quick!
The wire's showing!
Unbuckle me -- fast! Grab the leader. He ain't normal, this one... they never --
What's the point with hooks and Lines? --
Don't tell me my business! Quarter-mile, that way. Full throttle.
How -- if they're gonna keep on breaking?
What I do is trick him to the surface, got that? Then I can jab him, understand? Think I'm gonna haul it in as if he's a catfish, like everyone else does?
I never saw one that big.
What do we do? Get some help? Radio in?
Why don't we go in? Get another crack at him tomorrow.
We got a barrel on him. We can't lose him. We stay out here until we find him.
Let's call in -- we can radio and have a big boat here in an hour...
You hired me, remember? It's my $10,000. It's my shark...
Look a' that -- Bayonet Iwo Jima.
C'mon. Middle appendix --
C'mon. Middle appendix --
I almost had 'im.
What's that one, there?
Tattoo. Had it taken off.
He's busting the shaft! Start the pump!
Where...?
Where...?
The bilge pumps. There --
That's it! Radio in for help!
Shut up! Just pump her out!
Shut up! Just pump her out!
Yeah, Captain, as soon as I make a call.
Did you get him in the head?
No! No! No! Swing around! After him!
What about us?
Have to pump her steady, s'all.
He can't stay down with three barrels on him! Where is he?!
Have you ever had one do this?
Have you ever had one do this?
No!
He's trying to sink us!
Dead astern! Zig-zag!
He's chasing us! I don't believe it.
Full throttle! To port!
He's comin' up -- !
He's taken him!
How come the sun didn't used to shine in here?

He's sitting in it.
It's three feet deep, Martin
Michael! Come inside!
Michael! Come inside!
It's his birthday present, and you closed the beach, Honey. I told him not to go in the water after what happened yesterday. I don't believe he'll ever do it again.
It's his birthday present, and you closed the beach, Honey. I told him not to go in the water after what happened yesterday. I don't believe he'll ever do it again.
I told him not to go out until he memorized the handbook and the safety safety regulations, until he was sure of himself...
How come you have to tell them that?
Excuse me, but what are you talking about? Didn't they catch the shark this afternoon? It was on the Cape station news.
You too, sweetheart...
Thank you.
Why don't we have one more drink, you and I, and then we go down and cut open that old shark and see for sure what's inside him, or not.
Can you do that?
Can you do that?
I am Chief of Police. I can do anything I want. You want to come?
Home... New York?
No. Home here.
Colorful, isn't he?
You going to be all right?

Nothing to worry about -- I'll survive this.
Nothing to worry about -- I'll survive this.
I'll see you back soon. There's an extra pair of glasses in your black socks, and there's some suntan lotion and blistex in your kit.
Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum.
What'll I tell the kids?
What'll I tell the kids?
Tell 'em I went fishin'!
Martin! Are you going to shut down the beach on your own authority?
Do I need any more authority?
Now tell me something I don't know.
All I'm saying is that Amity is a summer town -- we need summer dollars, and if they can't swim here, they'll use the beaches at Cape Cod, or Long Island.

So we should set out a smorgasbord?
I don't think you can appreciate the gut reaction people have to these things.
I was only reacting to what I was told.
I can't work in a vacuum. Why don't you make Hendricks Chief? His family's been here since the Puritans -- half this island are his cousins.
Martin, we hired the best man we could find.
I'll get to that in a minute. First, I plan to start our seasonal summer help early, and to use shark spotters on beaches open to the sea. I'd like cooperation from local fishermen, and I've also contacted the Oceanographic Institute over on the mainland.
No need to involve outsiders in our business, Martin.
Only 24 hours!
I didn't agree to that!
Larry, if you'd see these clowns leave, you'd never believe they'd come back with anything. But they got him!
That's good. That's real good. Ben Meadows getting pictures for the paper.
That's good. That's real good. Ben Meadows getting pictures for the paper.

Who's that young man?
Matt Hooper, the specialist they send down from the Oceanographic Institute.

I think we all owe a debt of gratitude to these men for catching this monster.
Why not, Larry? We could get a positive confirmation that way.
Be reasonable, boys -- this isn't the time or the place to do some kind of half-assed autopsy on a fish. Ben... do you have all the pictures you need?
She's right.
Let's all get out of here, this place stinks.
Let's all get out of here, this place stinks.
I'm going home.
He lost it on the way up.
What kind of a shark did you say it was?
We have got to close the beaches. We have got to get someone to kill the shark, we need non-corrosive mesh netting, we need scientific support... It's gonna cost money just to keep the nuts out and save what we have.
I don't thing either of you is familiar with our problems...
You'd love to prove that. Getting your name in the National Geographic.
Larry, we can re-open the beaches in August.
Larry, we can re-open the beaches in August.
August! Tomorrow is the 4th of July, and we are going to open for business. It's going to be our best summer in years. If you're so concerned about the beaches, you two, you do whatever you have to to keep them safe, but with you or without you, the beaches stay open this weekend.
Got a pen on you?
Why?
Why?
There's only one thing you're good for anymore -- signing a damn voucher. Here. It's an authorization to employ a contractor.

...height and weight may only be estimated from partial remains. Torso severed in mid-thorax, eviscerated with no major organs remaining. May I have a drink of water? Right arm severed above the elbow with massive tissue loss from upper musculature. Portions of denuded bone remaining. -- did you notify the coast guard?
No, it was local jurisdiction.
No, it was local jurisdiction.
Left arm, head, shoulders, sternum and portions of ribcage intact. Please don't smoke. With minor post- mortem lacerations and abrasions. Bite marks indicate typical non-frenzy feeding pattern of large squali, possibly carchaninus lonimanus, or isurus glaucas. Gross tissue loss and post-mortem erosion of bite surfaces prevent detailed analysis; however, teeth and jaws of the attacking squali must be considered above average for these waters.

It wasn't an 'accident,' it wasn't a boat propeller, or a coral reef, or Jack the Ripper. It was a shark. It was a shark.
Well, if one man can catch a fish in 50 days, then I guess 50 of these bozos can catch a fish in one day -- beginner's luck.
You did it! Did Ben Gardner catch this?
I didn't say this wasn't the shark, I just said I wasn't sure this was the one...
What d'ya mean?
What d'ya mean?
There are hundreds of different kinds of sharks; makos, blues, hammerheads, white-tips... any one of them could've attacked. Look -- shark digestion is slow. We could open this one up, and find whatever he's been eating is still inside.
Dynamite! How was your day...?
Swell.
We ought to let it breathe... Whatever.
Let's all have a drink.
Drowning. Lemme ask you something. Is it true most attacks take place in three feet of water, around 10 feet from the beach?
Yeah. Like the kid on your beach. I wish I could've examined that shark they caught...

Chum?
Only one sure way to find him -- offer him a little something to eat. Chum -- blood, waste meat, fish, anything. They can sense it miles away. If he's out there, we might be able to get a closer look at him. It's a good time, too. They're night feeders...
What is all this stuff?
Depth-finder, fathometer, sonar, closed-circuit TV -- fore and aft -- RDF, single side band... And two loose nuts behind the wheel.

No shark did that to a boat!
There is a kind of shark called a Great White Shark that every expert in the world agrees is a maneater.
You're situation here suggests that a Great White has staked out a claim in the waters around Amity Island, and that he will continue to feed here as long as there is food in the water.

There's no limits to where he can strike, and we've had three attacks and two deaths in the past few days. It happened like this before, in 1916, when a Great White killed five swimmers at Jones Beach, in Long Island.

We towed Ben Gardner's boat in, Larry; he was dead and his boat was all chewed up.
I'm familiar with the fact that you are going to ignore this thing until it swims up and bites you on the ass! There are only two ways to solve this thing: you can kill it, or you can cut off its food supply...
That means closing the beaches.
Wait a minute! I need you.
Out there is a Perfect Engine, an Eating Machine that is a miracle of evolution -- it swims and eats and that's all. Look at that! Those proportions are correct. I know sharks.
I hope we get some more help.
I wish it would rain...
This has got to be one big violation...
This is quite a place.
What's that, a ship?
You were on the Indianapolis? In '45? Jesus...
What the hell?
It's a whale out there.
Don't shoot him any more! He's crazy on his own blood already!

Where'd you hide the 'Beach Closed' signs?
We never had any. What's the problem?
Polly told me to tell you there's a scout troop in Avril Bay doing the mile swim for their Merit Badges. I couldn't call them in, there's no phone out there.
Get out of there  take these back to the office and make up some 'Beach Closed' signs, and let Polly do the printing.

Mrs. Kintner must've put her ad in Field and Stream.
Looks more like the readers of the National Enquirer.
We're not even sure what it was.
What else could've done that?
...and Bill Mayhew almost caught him in his net...?
Doctor, you're the one who told me what it was!
Look, I've got to talk to her. This isn't a contest we want the whole country entering.
I agree. If she's going to advertise, I wouldn't recommend out-of-town papers. Amity people could take care of this.

I don't need to pass basic seamanship.
Let me see your hands...
Ha. City hands. You been counting money. If you had a $5000 net and $2000 worth of fish in it, and along comes Mr. White, and makes it look like a kiddy scissors class has gone to work on it and made paper dolls. If you'd ever worked for a living, you'd know what that means.
Look, I don't need to hear any of this working class hero crap. Some party boat skipper who's killed a few sharks...
Hey, Squirt! You want to stow this gear or you want me to use it for ballast? It ain't good for much but bait.
I'll see ya. Tell Dorothy hello.
Hello, Junior. What are you? Some kind of half-assed astronaut? Jesus Christ, when I was a kid, every little squirt wanted to be a harpooner or a sword fisherman. What d'ya have there -- a portable shower?
Anti-Shark cage.
Anti-Shark cage.
Who's inside, you or the shark?
What's that supposed to prove?
Just a little appetizer. I want our porker to know we're serving. I want to put some iron into that big yap...
Nothing. Nothing, nothing, nothing.
Hell, in the old days we went out with good charts, good sounding lead, and a damn good compass. Nowadays, these kids are afraid to go out without depth finders, radar, radio, electric toothbrush, every stupid thing...
Watch it! Compressed air -- you screw around with one of those and Boom! Careful, huh?
Real fine stuff but it won't mean a thing to Mr. Whitey, of course... he didn't go to schools in electronics. He was born with what he does best. Eat. He's a swimming appetite. 'Course he might eat this stuff, but then I've seen him eat a rocking chair, too. Next time, ask me.
That's pilot whale, isn't it?
It ain't a Big Mac. The expert don't approve. What do you thing? You're closer to the situation.
Hey, you! Farmer! Half-speed there...
Aye, Aye SIR. Stand by to repel boarders. Poop the mainsail. Argh, Jim Boy.

Down here, Hooper!
I don't know what it is, but it's not a shark.
Look -- you may be a big Yahoo in the lab, but out here you're just supercargo, and you'll do as I say, or you can take your gear and backstroke home. Now get down here!
A marlin, or a stingray. Huh. Don't ever tell me my business again. Get back up on the bridge.
I'm okay...
I'm okay...
Fasten the pole.

Moray Eel. Bit right through a wet suit.
Face and head scars come from amateur amusements in the bar room. This love line here... ...that's from some crazy Frenchie come after me with a knife. I caught him with a good right hand right in the snot locker and laid him amongst the sweetpeas.
Ever see one like this?
Bull shark scraped me while I was taking samples...
Nothing! A pleasure scar. Look here --
I'll drink to your leg.
And I'll drink to yours.
...Mako. Fell out of the tail rope and onto the deck. You don't get bitten by one of those bastards but twice -- your first and your last.

Easy! It'll tear right out!
The shaft is giving.
Coming right to us!
No -- comin' right at us! Slow ahead, he'll hit us head on -- Slower! Throttle back ---
He's heading under -- !
No way! He can't!
Follow him!
He's under!
What can that gun of yours do?
Power head with 20 ccs of strychnine nitrate. If I can hit him. I can kill him. But I gotta be close. Very close.
That's disgusting! This is the largest, meanest, most vicious shark ever landed off Amity Island, and a known maneater!
Let's just cut him open and see what's inside...
I'm sorry, Martin. She's in a sick, terrible state.
Look, maybe this is the wrong time to pursue this, but I'm not sure...
Is that tooth here? Did anyone see it?
I don't have it.
Carcaradon carcharias. A Great White.
Well, I'm not going to commit economic suicide on that flimsy evidence. We depend on the summer people for our lives, and if our beaches are closed, then we're all finished.
Sick vandalism! Brody, that's a deliberate mutilation of a public service message! I want those little paint-happy bastards caught and hung up by their baby Buster Browns!
That's it! I'm standing here arguing with a guy who can't wait to be a hot lunch. Goodbye.

I'm supposed to be running.
I know.
So, what do you think we should do?
I thought I might, you know, nip it in the bud before it gets worse. Because I heard in health class that pregnancy often results in an infant.

Whose idea was it?

I'll see you at school, O.K.?
Well! Nothing like experimenting.
I did the prep questions for this lab last night. You can copy my answers if you need to.
Oh, I couldn't copy your work.
But you copy my work every week.
But you copy my work every week.
Oh yeah. I'm kind of a deadbeat lab partner, huh?

Hey Juno... A couple of us are going to the cineplex after school to donut that movie with the guy with eighteen kids.
Sorry, Bleek... Going for my ultrasound. Gotta note and everything.
Sorry, Bleek... Going for my ultrasound. Gotta note and everything.
Okay, cool.
Okay, cool.
I'll try to drop by later.
What's up?
I just wanted to come over. You know, say hi. I miss hanging out with you on school nights.
I just wanted to come over. You know, say hi. I miss hanging out with you on school nights.
I miss it too.
So, it looks like you're getting pregnant-er these days.
Yeah. Um, I hooked up a whole private adoption thing. These married people in Saint Cloud are going to be the parents.
Really? What are they like?
The guy is super cool! His name is Mark and he's into old horror movies and he plays guitar. I actually hung out with him today.

I asked my dad and Bren not to narc us out to your folks, so we should be safe.
I asked my dad and Bren not to narc us out to your folks, so we should be safe.
Oh. That's a relief.
I'm going to really start looking like a dork soon. Will you still think I'm cute if I'm huge?
I always think you're cute. I think you're beautiful.
Jesus, Bleek.
Well, I do.
Hey Junebug, when all this is over we should get the band back together again.
Yeah. Sure. Once Tino gets a new drumhead we should be good to go.
Yeah. Sure. Once Tino gets a new drumhead we should be good to go.
We could get back together too.
We could get back together too.
Were we together?
Well, we were once. You know, that time.
What about Katrina De Voort? You could go out with Katrina De Voort.
What about Katrina De Voort? You could go out with Katrina De Voort.
I don't like Katrina.
I don't like Katrina.
I totally heard you did.
I totally heard you did.
I don't. Katrina smells like soup. Her whole house smells of soup.
Are you honestly and truly going to prom with Katrina De Voort?
Um, hi?
Um, hi?
Leah just told me you were going with her.
Leah just told me you were going with her.
Yeah, I did ask her if she wanted to go. A bunch of us from the team are going to Benihana, then the prom, then Vijay's parents' cabin.
We're getting a stretch limo.
Your mom must be really glad you're not taking me.
Your mom must be really glad you're not taking me.
You're mad. Why are you mad?
You're mad. Why are you mad?
I'm not mad. I'm in a fucking great mood. Despite the fact that I'm trapped in a fat suit I can't take off, despite the fact that everyone is making fun of me behind my back, despite the fact that your little girlfriend gave me the stinkeye in art class yesterday...

Katrina's not my girlfriend! And I doubt she was actually giving you the stinkeye. She just looks like that all the time.
You're being really immature.
What?
That's not how our thing works! I hurl the accusations and you talk me down, remember?
Not this time. You don't have any reason to be mad at me. You broke my heart. I should be royally ticked at you, man. I should be really cheesed off. I shouldn't want to talk to you anymore.
Not this time. You don't have any reason to be mad at me. You broke my heart. I should be royally ticked at you, man. I should be really cheesed off. I shouldn't want to talk to you anymore.
Why? Because I got bored and had sex with you one day, and then I didn't, like, marry you?
Why? Because I got bored and had sex with you one day, and then I didn't, like, marry you?
Like I'd marry you! You would be the meanest wife of all time. And anyway, I know you weren't bored that day because there was a lot of stuff on TV. The Blair Witch Project was on Starz, and you were like, "Oh, I want to watch this, but we should make out instead. La la la."

What? Are you ashamed that we did it?
What? Are you ashamed that we did it?
No...
No...
Well at least you don't have to walk around with the evidence under your sweater. I'm a planet!
Wait, let me take that.
Huh?
Huh?
You shouldn't be carrying that heavy bag. I'll take it.
You shouldn't be carrying that heavy bag. I'll take it.
Oh. It's fine. What's another ten pounds?
Did you put like a hundred things of Tic Tacs in my mailbox?
Yeah. That was me.
Yeah. That was me.
Why?
Why?
Because they're your fave. And you can never have too much of your favorite one-calorie breath mint.

I try really hard, actually...

No, you're naturally smart. You always think of the funniest things to do. Remember when you passed me that postcard during Spanish class, and it was addressed like, "Junebug MacGuff, Row 4, Third Seat From the Blackboard"? And it said, "I'm having fun in Barcelona -- wish you were here"? That was hilarious.

Plus, you're the only person who doesn't stare at my stomach all the fucking time. You actually look at my face. And every time I look at you, the baby starts kicking me super hard.

Can we make out now?
Can we make out now?
Okay.
You're a part time lover and a fulltime friend. The monkey on your back is the latest trend. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Here is the church and here is the steeple. We sure are cute for two ugly people. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.

Me neither. But I'm going to stop wearing underpants in order to raise my sperm count. See you.
What? I'm not made of stone.
Well, there we have it. Would you like to know the sex?
Wait, what's that supposed to mean?
I just see a lot of teenage mothers come through here. It's obviously a poisonous environment for a baby to be raised in.
They could be utterly negligent. Maybe they'll do a far shittier job of raising a kid than my dumbass stepdaughter ever would. Have you considered that?
No... I guess not.
No... I guess not.

You think you're special because you get to play Picture Pages up there?
Nails? Really?
No, I mean the father! Who's the father, Juno?
Just tell it to me straight, Bren. Do you think this is my fault? Her mother's fault?
I think kids get bored and have intercourse. And I think Junebug was a dummy about it. But we have to move on from here and help her figure it out.

You're not going to be a Pop-Pop. And Juno's not going to be a ma. Somebody else is going to find a precious blessing from Jesus in this garbage dump of a situation. I friggin' hope.

Oh God yeah. But I was hoping she was expelled or into hard drugs.

That was my first instinct too. Or D.W.I. Anything but this. And I'm going to punch that Bleeker kid in the weiner the next time I see him.

Oh Mac, no! He's a sweet kid. You know it wasn't his idea.
Juno? Did you happen to barf in my urn? Mac, you know that nice urn by the front door, the one I got up in Stillwater? I found some weird blue shit, I mean stuff, gunk, in there this morning.
I would never barf in your urn, Brenda. Maybe L.B. did it.
I have no idea how to spit this out.
Hon, did you get expelled?
Hon, did you get expelled?
No. The school would probably contact you in the event of my expulsion.
No. The school would probably contact you in the event of my expulsion.
Well, I was just asking. It seemed plausible.
Oh, God...
But I'm going to give it up for adoption. I already found the perfect people.
But they have a real lawyer and everything. I'm going to meet with them next weekend.
Junebug, that is a tough, tough thing to do. Probably tougher than you can understand right now.
Junebug, that is a tough, tough thing to do. Probably tougher than you can understand right now.

No.
Well, you're a brave young lady. You're made of stronger stuff than I thought. You're a little Viking!
Well, you're a brave young lady. You're made of stronger stuff than I thought. You're a little Viking!
Cool it.
Cool it.
First things first, we have to get you healthy. You need prenatal vitamins. Incidentally, they'll do incredible things for your nails, so that's a plus. Oh, and we need to schedule a doctor's appointment. Find out where you're going to deliver.

The term "deliver" is so weird. Can we not say "deliver"?
Where the hell have you been, Junebug?
I drove to St. Cloud to show Mark and Vanessa the ultrasound. And I wound up staying for a couple of hours.

You could have sent it to them. Why would you drive an hour out to East Jesus, Nowhere?
I don't know, I just did. And while we were waiting for Vanessa, Mark and I watched The Wizard of Gore and he burned me some CDs of weird music. He's kind of cool.
That was a mistake, Juno. Mark is a married stranger. You overstepped a boundary.
Listen, Bren-duhhh, I think you're the one overstepping boundaries. You're acting like you're the one who has to go through this and get huge and push a baby out of your vag for someone else. Besides, who cares if he's married? I can have friends who are married.

It doesn't work that way, kiddo. You don't know squat about the dynamics of marriage.

You don't know anything about me!
You don't know anything about me!
I know enough.
We don't even have a dog!
Yeah, because you're allergic to their saliva. I've made a lot of sacrifices for you, Juno. And in a couple years you're going to move out -- and I'm getting Weimaraners.
Yeah, because you're allergic to their saliva. I've made a lot of sacrifices for you, Juno. And in a couple years you're going to move out -- and I'm getting Weimaraners.
Wow, dream big!
Wow, dream big!
Oh, go fly a kite.
Ow, ow, fuckity-ow. Bren, when do I get that Spinal Tap thing?
It's called a spinal block, and you can't have it yet, honey. The doctor said you're not dilated enough.
It's called a spinal block, and you can't have it yet, honey. The doctor said you're not dilated enough.
You mean I have to wait for it to get even worse? Why can't they just give it to me now?

Well, honey, doctors are sadists who like to play God and watch lesser people scream.
Shit. Hey, can we give my kid the damn spinal tap already?
It really didn't hurt that bad having him.
So, Juno. First off, how far along are you?
I'm a junior.
I'm a junior.
No, I mean in your pregnancy.
No, I mean in your pregnancy.
Oh. Uh, my stepmom took me to the doctor yesterday and they said I was twelve weeks.
Yeah. Yeah! The way people used to do it. Quick and dirty, like ripping off a Band-Aid.
Well, then we agree a traditional closed adoption would be best for all involved, then?
Well, then we agree a traditional closed adoption would be best for all involved, then?
Shit, yeah. Close it up.
Amanda, I told you to go to the infirmary and lie down. You never listen.
No Josh, I don't take orders. Not from you and not from any man.
No Josh, I don't take orders. Not from you and not from any man.
You know, you've been acting like this ever since I went up to see my brother at Mankato. I told you, nothing happened!

What? My eyes are not lying!

Yes they are, Josh. Since Mankato, they have been lying eyes.
Good. Call me when you're OFF the rag.
Fine. Call me when you learn how to love just one person and not cheat at your brother's college just because you had four Smirnoff Ices and a bottle of Snow Peak Peach flavored Boone's!
Fine. Call me when you learn how to love just one person and not cheat at your brother's college just because you had four Smirnoff Ices and a bottle of Snow Peak Peach flavored Boone's!
Good, I'll be sure to do that, Amanda. I'll make a note of it.
This is our attorney, Gerta Rauss.
Geeeerta Rauuuss!
No.
Cool. Well, let's sit down and get to know each other a bit.
So, let's discuss how we're gonna do this... thing.
Well, I just have the baby and give it to you, right?
Whoah. I don't want to see pictures. I don't need to be notified of anything. Can't we just kick it old school? I could just put the baby in a basket and send it your way. You know, like Moses in the reeds.
Technically, that would be kickin' it Old Testament.
Whoops! Yikes, I didn't expect to see you up here.
Sorry. I was just getting something.
Sorry. I was just getting something.
Did your wife send you up here to spy on me?

What? No! Do we come off like paranoid yuppies or something?
What? No! Do we come off like paranoid yuppies or something?
Well, you don't just invite a random pregnant teenager into your house and leave her unsupervised. I could be a total klepto, for all you know.
Well, you don't just invite a random pregnant teenager into your house and leave her unsupervised. I could be a total klepto, for all you know.
I don't get a klepto vibe from you. Evil genius? Maybe. Arsonist? Wouldn't rule it out.
I don't get a klepto vibe from you. Evil genius? Maybe. Arsonist? Wouldn't rule it out.
I did steal a squirt of perfume. What do you think? It's Clinique Happy.
Am I supposed to feel happy now?
You should be happy, Holmes. I'm giving you and Vanessa the gift of life. Sweet, screaming, pooping life! And you don't even have to be there when the baby comes out of me all covered in...

Blood and guts.
Blood and guts.
We'd better get back downstairs ASAP.
Oh. That's, uh, my room. Vanessa lets me have a room for all my old stuff.
Wow, you get a whole room in your own house? She's got you on a long leash there, Mark.
Wow, you get a whole room in your own house? She's got you on a long leash there, Mark.

Oh.
Oh.
What? I'm a pawn shop rocker.
What? I'm a pawn shop rocker.
Sorry. I swear I'm not a gear snob.
What is that, Mahogany? What happens if you crack the neck?
Tell me about it. I used to play in a really tight band back when I lived in Chicago, and one night we opened for the Melvins... do you know who the Melvins are?
Tell me about it. I used to play in a really tight band back when I lived in Chicago, and one night we opened for the Melvins... do you know who the Melvins are?

You weren't even alive!
Your guitar is named Kimber?
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's all right. My axe is named Roosevelt. After Franklin, not Ted. Franklin was the hot one with the polio.
Juno? Wow, I didn't expect to see you here.
I've got something really cool to show you guys. Is Vanessa here?
I've got something really cool to show you guys. Is Vanessa here?
No, she's working late tonight. She's trying to accrue some extra time off for when, you know...
Right. I hear they can be kind of a time-suck.
Come on in. You wanna Ginseng Cooler?

You're kind of a sellout, aren't you? What would the Melvins say?
You're kind of a sellout, aren't you? What would the Melvins say?
They'd say you came a long way out here not knowing if anyone would be home.
Behold, good sir! The very first photo of your future child.
You're kidding!
I think it kind of looks like my friend, Paulie.
Oh, is he bald and amorphous?
Oh, is he bald and amorphous?
No, he's the dad.
Can you tell if it's a boy or a girl?
The doctor can tell, but I decided not to know. I want it to be a big surprise.

Well don't worry about it. My stepmom is forcing me to eat really healthy. She won't even let me stand in front of the microwave or eat red M&Ms. Hope you're ready.

It's only my favorite song. It's Sonic Youth doing "Superstar" by the Carpenters.

Don't you remember you told me you loved me, baby...
Hey, I like this.

This album is all Carpenters covers by alt-rock bands. It's called If I Were a Carpenter. It is God. I'll rip a copy for you before you leave.

It's the least I can do. What did you say your favorite band was?
I didn't. But it's a three-way tie between the Stooges, Patti Smith and the Runaways.
I didn't. But it's a three-way tie between the Stooges, Patti Smith and the Runaways.
Yeah, I definitely need to make you some CDs. At least while my kid is hanging out in there.
The Wizard of Gore?
Oh yeah. It's Herschel Gordon Lewis. He's the ultimate master of horror.
Oh yeah. It's Herschel Gordon Lewis. He's the ultimate master of horror.
Please. Dario Argento is the ultimate master of horror.
Argento's good, but Lewis is completely demented. We're talking buckets of goo. Red corn syrup everywhere. And fake brains up the yin-yang.
Frankly, this looks kind of stupid.
This is even better than Suspiria. You've got decent taste in slasher movies, Mark.
Here's to dovetailing interests.
So, have you and Vanessa thought of a name for the baby yet?
Well, sort of. Vanessa likes Madison for a girl.
Well, sort of. Vanessa likes Madison for a girl.
Madison? Isn't that kind of... I don't know, gay?
Madison? Isn't that kind of... I don't know, gay?
God, pretentious much? I guess everyone should have a mysterious name like Juno, huh?

My dad went through this phase where he was obsessed with Greek and Roman mythology. He named me after Zeus's wife. I mean, Zeus had other lays, but I'm pretty sure Juno was his only wife. She was supposed to be really beautiful but really mean. Like Diana Ross.

Uh, thanks.

I weighed my options. But after all this, I'm glad I didn't, you know, get rid of it. I want to have it. For you guys.

You're something else.
Vanessa. Shit, you better get out of here.
Why? What the big deal?
Why? What the big deal?
Nothing. She just hates when I sit around watching movies and 'not contributing.'
Nothing. She just hates when I sit around watching movies and 'not contributing.'
I'll handle this. I'm really good at diffusing mom-type rage.
Juno was nice enough to bring this by for us.
I came over as soon as I got that cold ultrasound goo off my pelvis. My stepmom verbally abused the ultrasound tech so we were escorted off the premises.
Hey, what kind of swag did you score?
Yeah. Mall madness, huh?
I doubt anyone's throwing us a shower.
Why?
Cold feet.
You should have gone to China. I heard they give away babies like free iPods. They shoot 'em out of those T-shirt guns at sports events.
Hello?
So, I've been spending a lot of time listening to that weird CD you made me.
Oh really? What's the verdict?
I sort of like it. I mean, it's cute.

Wow. That shirt is working hard.
Is Vanessa here?
Is Vanessa here?
Nope. We're safe.
Cool.
Come on, I have something for you.
Oh, Mark! Is this the baby's room? It's beautiful!
Hilarious. No, I just keep all of my old comics down here, and I want to show you one of them.

Oh God, you're one of those guys...

You're gonna like this, I promise.
"Most Fruitful Yuki"? What is... Oh my god, she's a pregnant superhero!
Isn't that great? I got it when I was in Japan with my band. She reminds me of you.
Wow, I actually feel like less of a fat dork now.
Most Fruitful Yuki is bad ass, man. You should be proud to be the same condition.
What?
I actually know this one.
I actually know this one.
You do?
You do?
Yeah, this song's older than me, if you can believe that. I danced to it at my senior prom.

That's almost interesting, Mark. Who did you dance with?

Her name was Cynthia Vogel and she was a good dance partner. Even let me put my hands on her butt.

Oh man, I can just picture you slow dancing like a dork!
Oh, okay. Like this.

Only squares and nerds go to dances.

What are you?

I don't know.
I'm leaving Vanessa.
What?
What?
It's just not working out, but I'm getting my own place in the city... and I've got it all planned out. It's something I've wanted to do for a long time...
No.
No?
No?
No. No, you definitely cannot do that, Mark. That's a big, fat sack of no!
No. No, you definitely cannot do that, Mark. That's a big, fat sack of no!
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
This isn't what we agreed on. You guys have to take care of... this! You are the chosen custodians of the big-ass bump!
But I thought you'd be cool if...
I want you guys to adopt the Buglet. I wanted everything to be perfect. Not shitty and broken like everyone else's family. Listen, once I have the baby, Vanessa is going to finally be happy, and everything will be all right. Believe me on this one!

I... How do you think of me, Juno? Why are you here?

I don't know. I just liked being your friend. I sort of liked becoming furniture in your weird life.

This... ...this is what my life has become. Stuff in boxes. Stuff underground. Is that so appealing to you?

Yeah, I guess... Is this my fault? Is Vanessa mad at you because of me?

That's not the point. We're just not in love anymore.
That's not the point. We're just not in love anymore.
Yeah, but didn't you love Vanessa when you married her? If you love someone once, you can love them again, I know it. My friend Leah has gone out with the same guy, like, four times. You're just not trying.
Please don't get a divorce! God, Mark, just do me a solid and stay with your wife.
God, you're so young.
God, you're so young.
Not really. I'm sixteen. I'm old enough to tell when people are acting like total a-holes!
Uh, hi Su-Chin.
Oh, hi Juno. How are you?
Oh, hi Juno. How are you?
Good. I'm good. Did you finish that paper for Worth's class yet?

No thanks. I'm off pills.

Wise move. I know this girl who had a huge crazy freakout because she took too many behavioral meds at once. She took off her clothes and jumped into the fountain at Ridgedale Mall and she was like, "Blaaaaah! I'm a kraken from the sea!"

I heard that was you.
I heard that was you.
Well, it was nice seeing you.
Juno! Your baby probably has a beating heart, you know. It can feel pain. And it has fingernails.
Really? Fingernails?
Hi! I'm Vanessa. You must be Juno and Mr. MacGuff. I'm Vanessa.
Vanessa, right?
Can I take your coats?
Sure.
Wicked pic in the Penny Saver, by the way. Super classy. Not like those other people with the fake woods in the background. Like I'm really going to fall for that, you know?
You found us in the Penny Saver?
I'll get drinks. What would everyone like? I've got Pellegrino, Vitamin Water...
A Maker's Mark, please. Up.
Oh, that's marvelous. So you're almost into your second trimester, then?
Yeah, apparently. I'm having it on May 4.
Yeah, apparently. I'm having it on May 4.
The tough part's almost over for you. I mean, my girlfriends always tell me the first couple months are the hardest.

Well, you're lucky it's not you.
Well, shall we start looking over the paperwork? Gerta has already drafted some preliminary documents.
Can I use the facilities first? Being pregnant makes you pee like Seabiscuit.

Room with a toilet, got it.
Oh. Sure. Of course you'd want to know how your kid is cooking.
So, then, you really think you're going to go ahead with this?
I'm going to say I'm 104% sure.
Oh really?
Oh really?
Look, if I could give it to you now, I would. But it probably looks like a Sea Monkey at this point, so I think we should leave it in there for a while until it gets cuter, you know?
Juno! God, you startled me. What are you doing here? What's wrong?
Nothing...
Nothing...
Then what's going on?
Then what's going on?
I went to the doctor today.
Is the baby okay?
Sure. It's the right size and everything. I even saw its phalanges today! Check this...
What...
This is the baby. Your baby.
Oh my God...
Doesn't it look like it's waving? It's kind of like it's saying "Hi, Vanessa. Will you be my mommy?"
Doesn't it look like it's waving? It's kind of like it's saying "Hi, Vanessa. Will you be my mommy?"
Yeah. Yeah, it kind of does.
Oh it's just some stuff I picked up. For, you know, the baby. Babies need a lot of things. I want everything to be just right.
I thought people got all that stuff at baby showers. When my stepmom had my sister I remember she got about a million presents. They were all lame though, so I wasn't jealous.
Um, I think people are kind of unsure about the situation because it's not, you know, set in stone.
What do you mean? You mean... Do you think I'm going to flake out on you?
What do you mean? You mean... Do you think I'm going to flake out on you?
No, no, I don't think that, Juno. It's just that, we went through a situation before where it didn't work out.
Right. Well, Juno, your parents must be wondering where you are. You might want to head home.
Naah. I'm already pregnant, so they figure nothing worse could happen to me. I gotta bounce anyway. It was nice seeing you guys again.
Well hi Vanessa! What brings you to the mall today?
Just, you know, shopping with my girlfriends.
No...
Please excuse Leah. She's mentally challenged.
Please excuse Leah. She's mentally challenged.
Oh, okay. So... how are you feeling?
Oh, okay. So... how are you feeling?
Happy? Oh, you mean like, physically. I'm good. Look, I have a snooze button now!
Um... Juno, can I -- Can I touch it?
Are you kidding? Everyone at school is always grabbing at my belly. I'm like a legend. They call me the Cautionary Whale.
Oh my God -- It moved! I felt it!
Elbow.
Elbow.
Wow! It's magical.
Juno? What's going on?
Nothing.
Mark? Why is Juno crying?
I'm not crying. I'm allergic to fine home furnishings. See you later.
Hi. I'm here for the big show?
Your name, please?
Your name, please?
Juno MacGuff.
Would you like some free condoms? They're boysenberry.
No thank you. I'm off sex.

My partner uses these every time we have intercourse. They make his balls smell like pie.

You should have seen this octopus furnace. I had to get out my Hazmat suit just to get up in there...
My dad used to be in the Army, but now he's just your average HVAC specialist. He and my mom got divorced when I was five. She lives on a Havasu reservation in Arizona...
So Juno, how did your maneuver go last night?
Which maneuver, sir? The one in which I moved an entire living room set from one lawn to another, or the one in which I cleared a sixty-four ounce blue slushie in ten minutes?
Do you need a large sum of money? Legal counsel?
No, no, I'm definitely not asking for anything. Except maybe mercy. Like, it would be really great if nobody hit me.
No, no, I'm definitely not asking for anything. Except maybe mercy. Like, it would be really great if nobody hit me.
What have you done, Junebug? Did you hit someone with the Previa?
They say they're going to pay my medical expenses and everything. I promise this will all be resolved in thirty-odd weeks, and we can pretend it never happened.
You're pregnant?
You're pregnant?
I'm so sorry, you guys. If it's any consolation, I have heartburn that's like, radiating down to my kneecaps and I haven't gone number two since Wednesday. Morning!
Who is the kid?
The baby? I don't know anything about it yet. I only know it's got fingernails, allegedly.
What?
Paulie Bleeker? I didn't know he had it in him!
Okay, this is no laughing matter.
No, it's not. Paulie is virile, by the way. He was very good in... chair.
Did you say you were thinking about adoption?
Yeah, well, there's this couple who've been trying to have a baby for five years.
Damn skippy, you're not! You don't even remember to give Liberty Bell her breathing meds.
Once! And she didn't die, if you recall!
I thought you were the kind of girl who knew when to say when.
I have no idea what kind of girl I am.
She's joking. Junebug has a wonderful sense of humor, which is just one of her many genetic gifts.
I also have good teeth. No cavities. We finally got fluoridated water in Dancing Elk.
Excuse me?
Well, no... I'm not going to sell the baby. I just want it to grow up with people who are ready to love it and be parents. I'm in high school, dude. I'm ill-equipped.
Hi Dad.
Hey, big puffy version of Junebug. Where have you been?

It's not easy, that's for sure. Now, I may not have the best track record in the world, but I have been with your stepmother for ten years now, and I'm proud to say that we're very happy.
I sort of already have.
Well, of course. Your old D-A-D! You know I'll always be there to love and support you, no matter what kind of pickle you're in.
What?!
Either I just pissed my pants or...

Thundercats are go!
Well, well. If it isn't MacGuff the Crime Dog! Back for another test?
I think the last one was defective. The plus sign looked more like a division sign.
Maybe you're having twins. Maybe your little boyfriend's got mutant sperms and he knocked you up twice!
Silencio! I just drank my weight in Sunny D. and I have to go, pronto.
Well, you know where the lavatory is. You pay for that pee stick when you're done! Don't think it's yours just because you've marked it with your urine!
Jesus, I didn't say it was.
Jesus, I didn't say it was.
Well, it's not. You're not a lion in a pride! These kids, acting like lions with their unplanned pregnancies and their Sunny Delights.
So what's the prognosis, Fertile Myrtle? Minus or plus?
I don't know. It's not... seasoned yet. Wait. Huh. Yeah, there's that pink plus sign again. God, it's unholy.
Yo-yo-yiggity-yo.
I am a suicide risk.

Heavy lifting can only help you at this point.
That is sick, man.

Nah, it was a premeditated act. The sex, I mean, not getting pregnant.

When did you decide you were going to do Bleeker?
Like, a year ago, in Spanish class.
Aha! You love him.
It's extremely complicated, and I'd rather not talk about it in my fragile state.
So, what was it like humping Bleeker's bony bod?
It was magnificent, man!
What are you doing here, dumbass? I thought I was supposed to pick you up at four.
I couldn't do it, Leah! It smelled like a dentist in there. They had these really horrible magazines, with, like, spritz cookie recipes and bad fiction and water stains, like someone read them in the tub. And the receptionist tried to give me these weird condoms that looked like grape suckers, and she told me about her boyfriend's pie balls, and Su-Chin Kuah was

Keep your voice down dude, my mom's around here somewhere. She doesn't know we're sexually active.
What does that even mean? Anyway, I got to thinking on the way over. I was thinking maybe I could give the baby to somebody who actually likes that kind of thing. You know, like a woman with a bum ovary or something. Or some nice lesbos.

Bleeker and I were going to go to Gettysburg for spring break.
Well, maybe you could look at one of those adoption ads. I see them all the time in the Penny Saver.
There are ads? For parents?
There are ads? For parents?
Oh yeah! "Desperately Seeking Spawn." They're right by the ads for like, iguanas and terriers and used fitness equipment. It's totally legit.

Come on, Leah. I can't scope out wannabe parents in the Penny Saver! That's tacky. That's like buying clothes at the Pump n' Munch.
The Penny Saver sucks.
Yeah, but it sucks for free.
Look at this one "Wholesome, spiritually wealthy couple have found true love with each other." "All that's missing is your bastard."
There's a guy in here who's giving away a piano. Free for the hauling! We should put it in Bleeker's yard.

You're not listening to me.

No, I heard you. I just can't give the baby to people who describe themselves as "wholesome." I'm looking for something a little edgier.

It is really weird looking. It's like it's not even real. I can't believe there are saps who actually cry at these things.
Aw, please Junebug?
No way. No, I definitely don't want to know.
How do you know I'm so poisonous? Like, what if the adoptive parents turn out to be evil molesters?
Or stage parents!
Yum. This pretzel tastes like a friggin' donut!
Share the love, Tits!
Hly shht!
What?
That's her. That's Vanessa Loring.
Of the Penny Saver Lorings?
No way! She's pretty.
You sound shocked or something.

I just thought she'd look really old in real life.
She's gonna steal that kid for her collection.
Right, seriously.
I want a huge cookie. And like, a lamb kebob. Simultaneously.

Are you jealous? I thought you said you didn't care what he did.
I'm not jealous, and I don't care. I just know he doesn't like Katrina and I don't think he should toy with her emotions like that. She seems so nice and all.

Okay Juno, I'm really convinced.
Okay Juno, I'm really convinced.
Prom is for wenises, anyway. Once you're old enough to go, it's not cool anymore.
Hello. Thank you for having me and my irresponsible child over to your home.
Oh no. Thank you. Come on in.
You don't say.
Well, haven't you ever felt like you were born to do something?

Yes. Heating and air conditioning.

Well, I was born to be a mother. Some of us are.
So. What's that thing?
A Pilates machine?
A Pilates machine?
What do you make with that?
What do you make with that?
You don't make anything. It's for exercising.
Obviously, we'll compensate you for your medical expenses.
Are you looking for any other compensation?
You're doing an amazing and selfless thing for us.
Vanessa has wanted a baby since we got married.

I want to be a mommy so badly!
You guys are playing music?
Juno just wanted a closer look at Kimber here.
What do you think? Custard or Cheesecake?
They're yellow.
They're yellow.
Well, I wanted to pick something gender-neutral for now. Once we get the baby, God willing, we can create a more decisive palette.

I just think it's too early to paint. That's my opinion.
And I disagree.
That wall is going to need something. Maybe we could put our first family picture there.
Hm.
Hm.
Can you see it?
Juno, what's the matter?
She's hormonal. Right, June? It's just part of the whole process.
What did you do?
I didn't do anything... I just... I've just been thinking.
I didn't do anything... I just... I've just been thinking.
What?

Just thinking if this is really the right thing for us.

What are you referring to?
I've been just wondering if we're, you know, ready.
Of course we're ready. We've taken all the classes. The nursery. The books --

I know we're prepared. I just don't know if... I'm ready.
Why don't we let Juno go home and we can discuss this later on, okay?
It all just happened so fast. We put that ad in the paper. I thought it would take months if, you know, ever and then -- boom -- Two weeks later, she's in our living room.

Like what? Be a rock star?

Don't mock me.
I called Gerta Rauss. She says she can represent both of us. They call it "collaborative divorce." It's apparently all the rage right now. And it's easy because we don't have children.
No, it's fine. Thanks for making the call, I guess.
We're actually, finally doing this?
Looks like it, yeah.
Looks like it, yeah.
Have you found a place to stay?

Aren't you the cool guy?
No.
Me neither. How 'bout you Carrie?
You lose!
I suppose anything's possible.
...You can forget about 'em forever and then look at 'em and they're doin' even better than before.
Adele... we gotta do something before Early kills someone else.
...There ain't nothin' can kill 'em. They can live for two even three hundred years.
Adele for god sake please lis...
Adele for god sake please lis...
There ain't nothing we could do. Once Early sets his mind on somethin', well thats the end of that.
Hi, I'm Adele.
Carrie.
...Pardon?
...I said, I like your hair.
...I said, I like your hair.
...Thank you.
One night we figured out how much bad luck he must have comin' from all them mirrors he broke... Four hundred and ninety four years to work it all off... After he dies, he'll have to keep coming back to earth over and over and over...
Karma.
What?
Karma... You know, if you do something bad to somebody fate will pay you back by something bad happening to you.

Is it hard to learn?
Is it hard to learn?
Not really.
You wouldn't have any color film, would ya?
...Yeah, sure.
You dropped this.
Early Grayce if this ain't your lucky day.
Early don't think women should smoke or curse or drink liquor.
So you don't do any of those things.
Better not, or Early'd whip me.
He whips you?
...Hey you're good. Thought you said you never played before?
I haven't... I'm a fast learner.
I told you how Early feels 'bout a woman drinking.
How'd you meet Early?
You know I can fix that haircut for you, if you want?
You can?
I'm cool.
Could I try that?
What's this?
It's a portfolio of my work.
It's a portfolio of my work.
Your pictures. Can I see 'em?
Your pictures. Can I see 'em?
Sure.
You took this picture?
Took 'em all.
That's me.
No it is not!
No it is not!
Hold still.
Hold still.
Sorry. Boy I'll tell ya, if Early found a picture of me like that I'd be black and blue for a week.
You shouldn't let him do that to you...
Do what?
Do what?
Adele... are you serious?
Adele... are you serious?
You think Early's bad to me, don't you?
You think Early's bad to me, don't you?
Yeah.
My momma's a beautician. Guess that's where I get it from. She wouldn't hear of my moving in with Early... on account of his just getting out of jail and all. Ain't seen her in nearly a year now. I wish she'd call me, just once.
What's Early been in jail for?
What's Early been in jail for?
Carryin' a gun.
Carryin' a gun.
...Anything else?
...Anything else?
An' resistin' arrest... At least that's what the Police said.
An' resistin' arrest... At least that's what the Police said.
Jeez... Adele!
The police are after him, he's a murderer!
...That's not true.
...That's not true.
What?
What?
That's not true!
...I wouldn't lie to you, Adele. . . I saw him kill that man.
Early didn't kill nobody, he wouldn't do that. I don't know why you're saying those things. You ain't my friend.
Happy birthday Adele.
Early, you are so sweet.
I feel kind of like the wizard of oz, you know when she gets the red shoes.
Well Dorothy, why don't you hand me that chili there.
What's up Adele? Dinner ready?
Almost.
Well... for one thing... They think faster out there, on account of all that warm weather they got; cold weather makes people stupid, that's a fact.
I guess that'd explain why there's so many stupid people around here.
I guess that'd explain why there's so many stupid people around here.
Yeah, and in California you never have to buy fruit 'cause it's all on the trees everywhere you turn... ...and, 'course there ain't no speed limit out there, and all drugs are legal... And I heard your first month's rent is free; state law. I figure 'til we get settled we can just move around month to month...

What'll we do out there?
What'll we do out there?
Well... the very first thing we're gonna do... is get us a couple of six packs of Lucky Lager and climb up on toppa' that famous Hollywood sign and howl at the moon...
You know... I read once... Ain't nothin' on that big old moon 'cept some old golf balls those astronauts left behind.
Bull. That ain't right... Government sends people there all the time, just don't want us to know about it.
Don't be long now, dinner's 'bout ready.
I heard that.
What if they're dangerous?
They ain't dangerous Adele. They're writers.
Did you settle things with Mr. Diebold?
Yeah I left him with the car... We're all squared up now.
Geez, they look kinda weird.
You just smile, let me do all the talking.
You just smile, let me do all the talking.
How many times you gonna tell me that?
How many times you gonna tell me that?
As many times as it takes.
Shush, Adele.
Early, can we stop there... just for a little while.
Can you believe thirty bucks for this room... for what? A lumpy mattress, that crummy TV and a crapper.
Early, sing me a song.
Early, what're you doin'?
Go back to the car and keep Brian there. I don't want him in here... Do it Adele... Now!
What the hell is this stuff?
It's Chinese food. It was the only place open. You said you was starving, you'd eat anyth...
Yeah but, what is it?
I don't know, they didn't speak too good English.
...thank you.
Thank you for what? What are you thanking me for Adele?
Thank you for what? What are you thanking me for Adele?
...I don't know.
...I don't know.
Well Adele... it was for... ...saving your fucking life back there!
What's wrong with her?
She had a dream that somethin' like this was gonna happen.
Nobody wants to hurt you Peaches!
Early! Stop!!
Oh, n'jus what in hell you crying 'bout? I'm the one got hit.
I changed my mind, Early. I'm not gonna climb up that Hollywood sign with you... I decided. I think your mean, and you hurt people.
What's your name, boy?
Walter Livesy.
Walter Livesy.
Think. I might just have to kill you Walter. How do you feel about that?
Think. I might just have to kill you Walter. How do you feel about that?

...Mind if I hold that Bible?
What do you need a Bible for?
You think I'm goin' to kill you. Well that'd make me a liar then wouldn't it?
No sir.
Tight fit.
Best kind.
Uh, we can stop somewhere if you and Adele haven't had time for breakfast, Early.
Well, it's like this, Mr. Kessler.
Well, it's like this, Mr. Kessler.
Brian.
Brian.
Well, it's like this, Bri'. I don't eat much in the mornin', never have. Maybe a beer once in a while; Lucky Lager's my favorite.
So what do you do Early?
Oh... I do some work up at the Merrick Mirror factory, or I used to...
You gonna talk to the people who did those murders?
That's a good idea. Unfortunately most of them have been executed.
That's a good idea. Unfortunately most of them have been executed.
...Too bad.
Can't hurt.
How much do I owe you?

Henry Lucas.
Henry Lucas.
Henry Lee Lucas. Well he was only convicted of killing eleven but he claimed to have killed over three hundred.
Henry Lee Lucas. Well he was only convicted of killing eleven but he claimed to have killed over three hundred.
Wonder what all them people done made him so mad?
How did he get away with it for so long anyhow?
He almost always killed strangers. Spent years moving on from one place to another. That made it real hard to track him down.
That bad?
...Then some.
...They never caught that Black Dolya Killer, huh?
Dahlia, no.
Dahlia, no.
Now why is that?
Now why is that?
Some people think it's because he never killed again. He just disappeared back into society.
Some people think it's because he never killed again. He just disappeared back into society.
You don't sound too convinced 'bout that?
You don't sound too convinced 'bout that?
I always thought it was the work of a serial killer. Anyone who took that much time and care bisecting another human being must have been enjoying it and would have done it again. And again. Until someone stopped him.

...Well then, that's how many I killed.
If you say so.
If you say so.
Damn right I do.
Ya see what I'm sayin'? Ha!

Hey... Ain't we getting near the next murder site... Bri?
Forget about it, doesn't matter.
Forget about it, doesn't matter.
Hell it don't... ...Hand me Brian's map there Adele. One day I'm gonna pass some store and see your book in the window. Me and Adele gonna buy a copy for our coffee table.
So tell me... what happened here?
Two brothers, prospectors, lived here. Up until a few years back.
...and?
They picked up hitchhikers... young men... and brought them back here.
You two been busy in here.
What happened to Adele?
What happened to Adele?
Well, let's put it this way. I need me a new woman.
Executing the killer wouldn't bring my mother back.
Thank god!
Okay, now you want to talk about good versus evil? Well then let's start with Adam and Eve and the snake.
Who do I have to blow to get out of here?
Who do I have to blow to get out of here?
A... I gotta go.
Tonight turned out to be pretty interesting.
The party?
The warehouse. I'm not that drunk.
It was definitely the high point of the evening.
Just being there where it really happened. It was different... more visceral.
Mmm... I love it when you talk like that.
I thought you wanted to be a writer.
...I do.
...I do.
Then you can write anywhere. Let's get out of here, while we still can.

Carrie, come on... we can leave anytime we...

No we can't. We can never leave once you start talking about tenure... and vacation pay... and parking privileges and... oh shit! let's just go to California now, right now, before it's too late.
...just like that?
...just like that?
Just like that. Load up the Lincoln... point it West... stop when we hit the fucking ocean.
Hey. I didn't have the heart to wake you.
Thanks. What are you doing?
Thanks. What are you doing?
Well, I sat down with my tapes and your photographs, which are great by the way... and I started writing.
So how's it going?
...I think it's the best stuff I've done.
...and I think I know why.
Why?
Why?
Because I was there. And for a moment that night I understood how she came to pull the trigger.
Because I was there. And for a moment that night I understood how she came to pull the trigger.
This mean your finally going to finish your thesis?

Look, fuck the thesis. I think there's a book here. Your photographs and my research, together.
Look, fuck the thesis. I think there's a book here. Your photographs and my research, together.
A book on the warehouse murders?
A book on the warehouse murders?
A book on some of the most infamous murderers in America. I want to go to where they lived and where they killed and I want you to photograph it.
What I'm thinking is, we can drop down through Tennessee, across Arkansas and into Texas, from there it's a straight shot into California. "We don't stop... until we hit the fucking ocean."
It's about fucking time, Kessler! I'd just about given up on you.
It's about fucking time, Kessler! I'd just about given up on you.
We don't have enough money, but we'll figure something out.
What did he sound like on the phone?
Real polite. Kept calling me 'sir.'
I like that.
I still think we should have met them first.
I still think we should have met them first.
Beggars can't be choosers. They were the only ones who answered the ride share note, remember?
Oh, yeah... He had a real thick accent right outta "Deliverance." "Still? Who said anything about a still? Get ya ass up in them woods!"
Funny, very funny.
Jesus... They've probably got five bucks between them. Turn around.
Lighten up...
We could have been in and out of there in less than ten minutes...
Hey, I got some great stuff... it's okay.
You mean because I object to having somebody take off their shoe and scratch their foot while I'm eating I'm prejudiced?
He can't help the way he was raised. I kinda feel sorry for him.
Feel sorry for him? Obviously you didn't get a whiff of that sock?
Bitch, bitch, bitch!
Bitch, bitch, bitch!
Up yours.
Up yours.
I heard that.
...And all I'm saying is I think we ought to try and get along with them. That's all.
You try, I'm gonna pretend they're with somebody else.
You try, I'm gonna pretend they're with somebody else.
Carrie.

I don't want to talk about it.
All set?
Fuck!
Fuck!
Take your time.
Who said he's my good buddy?
You sure been acting like you were... ...Out whoopin' it up, a drankin' and ever' thang.
Yeah, and you should've seen how terrified she was that he'd find out. He beats her.
How do you know that?
How do you know that?
She told me... ...but only when she "deserves" it. Did you know he was in jail?
Stop being so fucking melodramatic! If it was murder he'd still be locked up or on parole, in which case he wouldn't be allowed to leave the state.
Maybe he wasn't allowed to leave! Geezus Brian!
What is it?
Look again!
What's that?
A copy of a tape they found. He recorded everything.
There's more...
I'm finished.
I'm scared. A week ago you would never have even thought to pick up that gun. This afternoon you're out there wielding it around like Clyde fucking Barrow, for Christ's sake! What's with you?
Okay, it was a cheap thrill, it was stupid, I admit it, alright? But let's not blow this. Not now... Let's just get the photos.
Okay, it was a cheap thrill, it was stupid, I admit it, alright? But let's not blow this. Not now... Let's just get the photos.
I can't believe I agreed to do this.

Oh come on, don't give me that shit... you wanted to take these photos as much as I wanted you too.
Oh come on, don't give me that shit... you wanted to take these photos as much as I wanted you too.
Wrong! I was willing to do whatever it took to get you up off your ass and on the way to California... There's a big difference.
Brian I want him out of our car!
Why, what did he do?
Why, what did he do?
Brian get him out of the car. Next gas station either he leaves or I do!
Carrie... stop it.
What the fuck is wrong with you Brian!? If you'll stop taking notes for once and open your eyes... you'll see that he is a homicidal fucking killer. He is... for real!
What the fuck is wrong with you Brian!? If you'll stop taking notes for once and open your eyes... you'll see that he is a homicidal fucking killer. He is... for real!
Shut up Carrie, please... just shut up!
You gotta talk to her. She looks up to you, she'll listen to you.
I tried talking to her at the mine. It didn't work.
I tried talking to her at the mine. It didn't work.
Then try again,
Carrie, watch for Early.
What are you going to do?
What are you going to do?
I'm going to try and lift the end of the piano. If I can... slide your cuffs free.
What about you?
I don't know.
Any word from that gallery?
Not yet.
Not yet.
Nervous?
Nervous?
...Apprehensive. Let's not forget these are the people who banned the Mapplethorpe show. Anyway, California's loaded with galleries.
...Apprehensive. Let's not forget these are the people who banned the Mapplethorpe show. Anyway, California's loaded with galleries.
You mean 'Ted Bundy's' finally agreed to leave?
...Soon as he finishes his thesis.
Listen, Eric's been "finishing" his for over three years now.
I'm sorry, but I just can't see you veggin' out in LA-LA LAND.
Oh, I don't know... I think that once I dye my hair blonde, buy a string bikini and cultivate that tan... I could be veggin' out with the best of 'em... Like fer shurr!
Bri'.
Where's Adele?
Where's Adele?
She wasn't feeling so good.
...Need a hand with those bags?
No, thanks, I can manage.
Ain't you done enough drinking for tonight?
...Brian hurt his foot.
Sometimes... Don't know why it is... I get so hot I can't stand it. I just start sweating like a dog. You ever get like that?
No.
...never?
No, never. Excuse me.
Tell ya Bri., I'm still a little sleepy,... think Adele and me are gonna take us a fiesta.
Siesta.
Early, just think...
Shut your mouth.
He's a killer, Brian... He's fucking insane.
Everybody just shut up!
Darlin' you were 'bout that far from spendin' the night at the morgue. You understand?
He wasn't going to shoot her, you murdering son of a bitch!
Who d'ya think you're foolin'? I know you better than you think...
...You're hurting me...
You were plenty hot.
You sick twisted fuck! You don't know shit about me.
...You know what I mean?
...I know I'd love to smash this bottle right in your fucking face.
You're supposed to call me when you lose your job Early. I stopped by the mirror factory today, you left quite a mess behind there.
Wasn't my fault...
...The police were way out of line when they stopped you from beating that bartender half to death. And no doubt God'll be pickin' on you on Judgement Day...
I ain't got nothing against God. It's the people he let come into the world... lot of them should have been stopped at the door. What are you looking for?
You be at this personnel office, Friday, three o'clock sharp.
What is it?
What is it?
...Janitor's job.
...Janitor's job.
Oh man... come on, I don't want no janitor job.

Without his car?
What about the owner of the house... ...this John Diebold, any idea where he might be?
No, but I can tell you he's not gonna be too happy about this.
...Diebold?
...That'd be my guess.
...That'd be my guess.
Looks like somebody cut off his ring finger.
Looks like somebody cut off his ring finger.
Well now I'd say that's the least of Mr. Diebold's problems.

And sometimes it takes a long time, and you're fucking gagging.
And sometimes it takes a long time, and you're fucking gagging.

And it's like. How much more can I bob here? You know.
Wish me luck.
Good luck.

Don't go anywhere. Stay with me.

Whah you say? Dissdee?
Yeah. And sex is just like, yeah let's have sex.
It's like yeah whatever. But when you fuck. You wanna fuck that person. You're like ripping each other's hair out. Ooooh.
You know... You know a lot of times sex gets in the way. Has that ever happened to you?
Yep.
Yep.
You know. Because sometimes the foreplay is just so good. And then when it actually comes time for sex. It's like the worst letdown.
I was like yes! I'm going out with him!
That's right. That's why foreplay is better than sex.
That's right. That's why foreplay is better than sex.
Yep.
Yep.
Because he can like climax you up to that...
And you don't get shit out of it.
Have you ever swallowed it before?
Yep. That's the best way. It's that boom boom boom.
Right. You know it's not like... You know there's a difference between sex, making love, and fucking!
Right. You know it's not like... You know there's a difference between sex, making love, and fucking!
Yep.
Yep.
Making love is like.
Making love is like.
Sweet.
Yeah.
It's like...
It's like...
You know what it's like. It's like when you really love someone, it's like awww.
You know what it's like. It's like when you really love someone, it's like awww.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Its like. But it gets boring. It's boring.
Its like. But it gets boring. It's boring.
It's really slow. It's slow boring.
Yeah. Mine are my toes. Oh my God if someone sucks my toes I'll come in like ten seconds!
Yeah. It depends. Cause like this one time with Eric, when we got blasted at his house. And Smash J and DJ Flipper was there...
Yeah. It depends. Cause like this one time with Eric, when we got blasted at his house. And Smash J and DJ Flipper was there...
Oh shit.
Oh shit.
And we were blasted, and he must have been dumb horney. And he just pulled me over to the bed. And they were in the room, like getting dressed, like getting ready to go to go to Disco
Yep.
But then the sex gets into the way and you're like: What happened! What the hell happened?!
But then the sex gets into the way and you're like: What happened! What the hell happened?!
Yeah it's the biggest disappointment!
Yeah. The shit gets wacked. Fifteen minutes.
Yeah. Fifteen minutes to a half an hour. Hard and deep.
Yeah. Fifteen minutes to a half an hour. Hard and deep.
Me. I can only take it up to fifteen minutes. Cause I get bored.
Me. I can only take it up to fifteen minutes. Cause I get bored.
Yeah I get bored.
Yeah I get bored.
I start thinking about what I'm gonna eat afterwards.
I've known the past of all the people I've fucked without a condom. Like I know one of the people got tested and was negative.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And I know that one of them fucked like two other girls, who were both virgins, so I knew he was safe.
And I know that one of them fucked like two other girls, who were both virgins, so I knew he was safe.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And the other person I just fucked, which was a mistake. But I went to the clinic last week with Jennie.
I made her get tested with me because I didn't want to go alone.
Did they ask you a lot of questions?
How can you hang out with Casper? He's such a jerk.
You think so?
You think so?
Yeah. I've always hated that kid. He used to eat glue in like seventh grade.
Yeah. I've always hated that kid. He used to eat glue in like seventh grade.
He still does.
He still does.
I hate 'em.
I hate 'em.
It's not his fault. He had a hard life.
It's not his fault. He had a hard life.
Yeah?
Yeah?
You've heard the stories right?
You've heard the stories right?
No.
So that's why Casper is how he is.
Oh god. That's horrible.
Yep.
Holy shit. That's all true?
Holy shit. That's all true?
No. I was just kidding.
No. I was just kidding.
What?!
What?!
I lied. His dad is still alive. He works for the post office.
Hi mom.
Hi Telly. Where you been?
Sorry. Dad made me promise not to give you any money until you find a job.
But then I won't need your money.
But then I won't need your money.
That's right.
Mom.
Shh.
Shh.
I'm gonna go out for a little while.
I'm gonna go out for a little while.
When are you gonna be back?
When are you gonna be back?
Not too late.
Not too late.
Four-thirty in the morning?
Four-thirty in the morning?
Not too late.
Hey Mom. Are you sure I can't get any money? Just a few bucks.
If I had it, maybe. But right now I don't have a penny to my name.
If I had it, maybe. But right now I don't have a penny to my name.
All right.
Hello?
It's me. Telly.
It's me. Telly.
Hello?
Hello?
Paul it's Telly. Open up.
What are you guys doing?
Nothing. We just wanted to come by and see what you were up to.
Nothing. We just wanted to come by and see what you were up to.
You want a wip-it?
You want a wip-it?
Nah.
So, how many people live here now?
I don't know, eight or nine.
I don't know, eight or nine.
Where does everyone sleep?
Where does everyone sleep?
Everywhere. Fuckin' flophouse. We're still short on the rent. If you want, you and Casper can move in. You guys can share the bathtub.
That's the whole thing. You know if you look at it. I mean all you hear about is disease this and disease that. And everyone's dying. And you better wear a condom or else. But the truth is. I don't know any kids with AIDS. No one I know has ever died from that shit. It's like some weird make-believe story that the whole
Yep.
First times are always wacked. Just be glad you didn't lose your virginity in the backseat of a rental car.
That shit is nothin'. I remember, I had just turned 14. With this fuckin' asshole who was like 18. I don't even remember his name. I think it was John or Jake or something. I remember he had a brother named Lentil because I would always joke and call him Lentil Bean. This was away at like sleep away camp with your friends and
Slow.
It's grandmother style.
Yeah.
It's very monotonous.
Right.
And we were like underneath the sheets. We were going at it like crazy. Oh my God that shit was so good! It was like hard...
And we were like underneath the sheets. We were going at it like crazy. Oh my God that shit was so good! It was like hard...
Yeah.
Yeah.
He was like sucking my tits. He was fucking fingering me. But that shit was nice and hard.
Yeah. And it takes them either too long or too short to come. Have you ever had someone that took forever
To come?
To come?
Yeah. I had sex with Jake, and it took him like an hour and a half.
It was... it was.
It's like sweet and sour, and salty butter.
It's like sweet and sour, and salty butter.
No, no, no. You can't get that taste out of your mouth. Until you eat something.
No, no, no. You can't get that taste out of your mouth. Until you eat something.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You can drink like there's no tomorrow but you still can't get that sperm between the teeth out. It's so disgusting.
What man? What is it?
Yo, let me get in your parent's room man. Just fir a little while.
Yo, let me get in your parent's room man. Just fir a little while.
I can't man.
I can't man.
Come on Steven hook me up. Do me this solid. Come on man. I gotta get Darcy alone. She's gonna let me fuck her man. Please.
Come on Steven hook me up. Do me this solid. Come on man. I gotta get Darcy alone. She's gonna let me fuck her man. Please.
Shit. All right. But don't fuck with anything OK?
Shit. All right. But don't fuck with anything OK?
OK.
I've talked to a few people who say you and her were... friendly?
Chess tournaments can be boring sometimes. People have a lot of free time. They like to gossip.
By yourself?
Yes.
We seem to have a little problem here?
What kind of problem?
What kind of problem?
I think you're lying. That's what kind of problem.
I think you're lying. That's what kind of problem.
What are you saying?
Casual.
Casual? You were boning her weren't you?
Casual? You were boning her weren't you?
It wasn't serious. What's your problem?
It wasn't serious. What's your problem?
You are! I don't like you.
You are! I don't like you.
Fine, don't ask me out on a date.
What's that supposed to mean?
It means, if I were a killer and I thought the police were closing in on me I might invent someone to try and put them off the scent.
It means, if I were a killer and I thought the police were closing in on me I might invent someone to try and put them off the scent.
That's crazy! Why would I draw attention to myself like that?

You like to play games, don't you, Peter?

He says on the photo he'll call tomorrow at eleven. Why not come back then and listen for yourself.
He says on the photo he'll call tomorrow at eleven. Why not come back then and listen for yourself.
Oh, we'll be back. You can bet on it.
Meaning, it looks like his victims are chosen at random.
No.
What do you mean, no?
He says it's a game. All games have a strategy.
He says it's a game. All games have a strategy.
All you gotta do is look at the map.
All you gotta do is look at the map.
His victims aren't random. It only means that they appear to be random. There's a connection, we just have to find it.
Morpheus.
What?
What?
Not what -- who. Morpheus. The Greek God of dreams. Look at the next line. "Her God has gone and left his home."
Are you crazy?
Let's see how much he wants to play.
What in the hell do you think you're doing? Slamming down the phone in the middle of the trace.
You think you're going to catch him on a trace? Everything he does is planned out well in advance. The only way we're going to get him is to rattle him -- make him slip up.
We didn't ask for your opinion, Doctor.
Maybe you should.
You don't tell us how to run our investigation. You got that?
You don't have an investigation without me. You got that?
You know, I figure that's pretty much how these girl's feel just before they get it. You think I'm right?
I wouldn't know.
I wouldn't know.
That's right. I guess only the killer would know that.
That's right. I guess only the killer would know that.
How'd you get in here?
How'd you get in here?
The door was open.
The door was open.
No it wasn't.
No it wasn't.
Of course it was. Otherwise I'd be breaking and entering. That's a felony.
Of course it was. Otherwise I'd be breaking and entering. That's a felony.
What do you want?
What do you want?
You ever do any hunting, Peter?
No.
I used to. With my old man. He taught me how to hunt and trap. Trapping's a lot harder than most people think. We used to go after Raccoons mostly. They'd get into our garbage, our fields. When an animal can't live peacefully with those around it, it has to be destroyed. But they're crafty little devils. You see the trick is, you can

What if he doesn't bite? What if he's an exceptionally bright Raccoon?
What if he doesn't bite? What if he's an exceptionally bright Raccoon?
Well then, you just gotta find out where he is -- and once you're sure where he is -- you shoot the fucker.
You got it on the board.
No, I need the original note.
No, I need the original note.
There's a photostat of the original on the wall.
He's not talking about himself.
Then what's he talking about?
Then what's he talking about?
If we knew that we'd know the answer to the riddle, wouldn't we? He's telling us where he's going to kill tonight and we can't see it.
Then let's narrow it down.
Homesearchers.
We're interested in where you were from the time you left the auditorium until you got there.
I was at the beach.
You sure you weren't over on Pine Road?
I'm positive.
I'm positive.
You're a lying bastard!
You're a lying bastard!
Fuck you! I'm tired of your goddam accusations! If you want to arrest me go ahead! Otherwise back off.
Fuck you! I'm tired of your goddam accusations! If you want to arrest me go ahead! Otherwise back off.
It's all a big game isn't it? A sick, fuckin' game. I don't know if there's two of you involved, or what -- but we're going to find out. Last night you gave us just enough to send us to the wrong place. It must've shocked the hell out to you when Frank walked in on Pine Road and you couldn't finish.
Yes you are.
Get off me!
You set yourself up tonight when you attacked Kathy, you crazy fuck!
What?
The message! I figured out--
Sit down!
You want me to what?
I want you to feed every street in this grid into your computer.
I want you to feed every street in this grid into your computer.
It'll take hours. You can't make me do this.
It'll take hours. You can't make me do this.
You're right, I can't make you do it. Besides, you're probably gonna be too busy with the Franchise Tax Board anyway.

What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
I gotta friend over there. He was telling me things are kind of slow. So, I figured I'd give him a call, have him come down here and look through your records. You know, give him something to do.

What's the first street?
Sorry to ruin your trip to the city, but we got a real nut on our hands, Frank.
Run it down.
Debi Rutlege. Female. Caucasian. Twenty four. Worked over at the Four Oaks Hotel.
Local?
Local?
No. She just moved here last month from Portland.
What do you think?
He's got an answer for everything, but he doesn't have an alibi.
He's got an answer for everything, but he doesn't have an alibi.
You think he's dirty?
You think he's dirty?
I don't know, but I think you're right. He's lying.
We wouldn't want someone's death to interfere with your games.
What was your relationship with her?
Take it easy. Both of you.
I'm sorry, this is just too convenient.
No shit!
Could someone this disturbed give the appearance of being normal?
Sorry.
Anything?
The F.B.I. has nothing remotely similar to this guy. I think he's a first- timer.
Check with the State. If he's never killed outside of Washington the F.B.I. wouldn't have it. Nolan?
You still having a problem with this?
Yeah, I am. I think he's playing us. If I was a killer and the police were trying to make a case against me, what better why to draw them off than to put their attention on someone else?
We've checked. There's no one with the last name of Emma on the Island.
Maybe he's going to drug her?
How is she?
She's unconscious, but they think she's going to make it.
She's unconscious, but they think she's going to make it.
You alright?
You alright?
I've seen a lot of things in my time on the job, but nothing like this. Yurilivich?
I've seen a lot of things in my time on the job, but nothing like this. Yurilivich?
I was with him the whole time until I got the call at the hotel.
I was with him the whole time until I got the call at the hotel.
Sanderson?
I spoke to Jeremy. He's watching Sanderson's kid. Sanderson went out after the match and hasn't come back since.
Find him! I want to talk to him.
What is it?
It's a voice modulator.
Ready for round two?
I've got a feeling we're going to go the distance with him. Let him sweat for a little while.
You should be an actor, Frank. You looked like you were really mad. The veins popping out on your neck was a really nice touch.
You weren't mad at him for picking up the phone?
Why does he call Sanderson?
He's one of the best Chess players in the world. Who better to play a game with?
Sending yourself anonymous notes in the mail is one thing -- but who called him today?
I don't know. Maybe there's two of them. Maybe he hired some Wino to make the calls.
I don't know. Maybe there's two of them. Maybe he hired some Wino to make the calls.
Maybe you're reaching a bit? I think Sanderson should be in on this. There's a reason why the killer's calling him.
A few people.
Did anyone stand out?
Did anyone stand out?
What do you mean, stand out?
What do you mean, stand out?
Did anyone look suspicious? Think!
Did anyone look suspicious? Think!
Now that you mention it there was somebody who looked suspicious.
Now that you mention it there was somebody who looked suspicious.
What was suspicious about him?
It doesn't make sense because we don't understand it.
But a hundred men could move him.
Don't fuck with us! Where did you go!
He was with me?
Remember eventually revenge is carefully... Have you tired juxtaposing the words?
Oh, c'mon. We're not going to spend any more time on this crap, are we? It doesn't mean anything. It's Sanderson!
Oh, c'mon. We're not going to spend any more time on this crap, are we? It doesn't mean anything. It's Sanderson!
It isn't him. Frank, you brought me in on this in the beginning because you wanted my opinion if he was capable of doing this.
It isn't him. Frank, you brought me in on this in the beginning because you wanted my opinion if he was capable of doing this.
Jesus, you're sleeping with the guy. You've lost your perspective. You can't possibly be unbiased.
We'll find the evidence.
You couldn't find your dick in a wind storm!
Hello, Peter.
Who is this?
Who is this?
Someone who's going to become an important part of your life. I want to play a game with you.
Someone who's going to become an important part of your life. I want to play a game with you.
I haven't got time for this.
Hello, Peter.
Just a second. Hello?
Very amateurish, Peter. I'm surprised you would use such an obvious tactic. I'm not an idiot! Don't treat me as one! I'll call you everyday... You get one minute, whether you put me on hold or talk is up to you! Are you ready to play?
Yes. Why did you kill Debi Rutlege?
Yes. Why did you kill Debi Rutlege?
To get your attention.
To get your attention.
Did you know her?
Did you know her?
No, only the path she chose to travel.
And -- what path is that?
We all have paths to follow. You hope yours will lead you to me.
We all have paths to follow. You hope yours will lead you to me.
Why did you write remember on the wall?

That's something you'll have to figure out for yourself. Really, Peter, you can't expect me to answer such direct questions.
That's something you'll have to figure out for yourself. Really, Peter, you can't expect me to answer such direct questions.
Why not?
Why not?
You don't want to think and that's why I'll win! I'm already two points ahead.
You don't want to think and that's why I'll win! I'm already two points ahead.
What?
I did another one last night. You might have saved her, but you didn't want to play.
Where is she?
Where is she?
You'll find her.
You'll find her.
If you got something to say to me, just come out and say it!
I suppose you want to know where I'm going to kill tonight, Peter?
You're not going to tell me that.
You're not going to tell me that.
"Wee Willie Winkie runs through the town. Upstairs and downstairs in his nightgown. Crawling through the window. At the end of Miss Emma's street. Her God has gone and left his home. So her and I can meet."
Hello?
Do you know what I'm doing right now, Peter? I'm looking at the name of the girl I'm going to kill tonight.
Do you know what I'm doing right now, Peter? I'm looking at the name of the girl I'm going to kill tonight.
You know her?

Not really.

Why her?

Because she's the type.

But you said you didn't know her.

I know what I said! She looks just like...

I really wish you'd stop trying to maneuver me. I find it irritating, not to mention insulting.
I really wish you'd stop trying to maneuver me. I find it irritating, not to mention insulting.
I'm just trying to play the game.
I'm just trying to play the game.
You're not playing very well. There are clues all around you and you keep missing them.
I'm sure there are other people who would be interested in what I have to say.
Then call them!
Just for that no hint today.
Why are you doing this? You must have some idea of the pain you're causing people.
Why are you doing this? You must have some idea of the pain you're causing people.
Pain? Pain is just a state of mind. It's something you learn to live with. I have.
And you want these girls to feel your pain?
Please, I don't want to get into the psychological aspects of my actions. It would detract from the game.
Please, I don't want to get into the psychological aspects of my actions. It would detract from the game.
How?
How?
I couldn't say it any better than Huxley.
Huxley's quote also says, "his play is always fair and just."
So is mine, within the framework of my rules.
Have you any idea what the message is?
If it's so important, why don't you just tell me?
If it's so important, why don't you just tell me?
I couldn't tell you that. It would ruin the game. Not that you're playing it very well.
I couldn't tell you that. It would ruin the game. Not that you're playing it very well.
You like to brag, don't you?
What?
You heard me. Why did you go out to the institute looking for her?

What makes you think I was there?

I couldn't tell you that. It would ruin the game.
I couldn't tell you that. It would ruin the game.
The game's almost over, Peter, and you're running out of time.
It's you who's running out of time. You're starting to make mistakes now. You're wondering just how much I really know. Just how close I'm getting? Well, I'm closer than you think, pal -- and I'm gonna nail your ass to the wall!
Very nice speech, Peter. Did you rehearse that, or was it impromptu? There's an old wooden bench in the garden. Next to it is a rock. You'll find a message for you under it. Let's see if you're as clever as you think you are.
Hello.
Last night was very exciting, wasn't it? Have you figured out what I'm doing?
Last night was very exciting, wasn't it? Have you figured out what I'm doing?
You're playing the Tarakoss opening.

Very good.

You're next move should have been e2- e3.

The police haven't told you?
The police haven't told you?
They think that you and I are doing this together.
Interesting concept. I hadn't thought of that. If you think about how Anton Berger plays chess you might get it.
I'm beginning to think it doesn't mean anything. Remember eventually revenge- -
I'm beginning to think it doesn't mean anything. Remember eventually revenge- -
--you're hopeless! You can't even read a sentence! Didn't they teach you punctuation in school? The game ends tonight!
Hello, Peter.
You sonofabitch!
You sonofabitch!
Emotional? I expected more from you.
Emotional? I expected more from you.
If you kill tonight and I'm in jail the police will know I'm innocent.

By that time the game will be over.
By that time the game will be over.
I've figured out the message.
I've figured out the message.
No you haven't. And even if you had it doesn't matter. Who would you tell? The police don't believe you, and you've just used your only phone call.
Yes?
Congratulations on your daring escape. You just missed me by a few seconds. It's check, Peter.
Congratulations on your daring escape. You just missed me by a few seconds. It's check, Peter.
Let me speak to my daughter.
Let me speak to my daughter.
She's in the other room. I just wanted you to know she wasn't dead... yet. But it's time for her to die now.
She's in the other room. I just wanted you to know she wasn't dead... yet. But it's time for her to die now.
Please... wait.
Please... wait.
The game's over. You lost.
The game's over. You lost.
It's me you want. Not her.
It's me you want. Not her.
No. As usual you're wrong. It is her I want. Killing you would be easy. Living with the consequences of losing will be much more of a defeat.
That wouldn't be very sporting. Remember Huxley? "His play is always fair and just."
You're groping. I have been fair. It's my move now.
You're groping. I have been fair. It's my move now.
I'll give you anything you want. Anything! Please!
I'll give you anything you want. Anything! Please!
Don't beg, Peter. She has to die. I can't win unless she dies.
I was thinking about leaving the phone line open so you could hear her die -- but I've decided it's better if you don't know exactly when I kill her. Good-bye Peter.
No! Wait!!
I know where you are.
Very good. How did you know?
Very good. How did you know?
The pipes.
How'd you know I wouldn't be in the same room with her?
You told me. When you called you said she was in the other room. Drop the knife.
This isn't going to help, David. You're mother's dead. You can't undo it.
You don't understand.
You don't understand.
Yes, I do. I found your file. I know what happened.
Yes, I do. I found your file. I know what happened.
They took away the game because of him. My father left and my mother... There was so much blood... It covered everything.
They took away the game because of him. My father left and my mother... There was so much blood... It covered everything.
I know, but this isn't going to bring her back.
Don't you see? I had to make it right. I ignored my mother's crossing. I sat with them all. I held their hands. I stroked their hair. I was with them to the end. I took away the blood. I washed them. Their crossing was peaceful.
I think your mother knows that now. Why don't you put the knife down. Put it down, David.
Naw, it's all fixed. I also loaded up a program that'll analyze your games three hundred percent faster.
Thanks.
What's this?
Oh, I put a few games on for your daughter. I hope you don't mind.
Oh, I put a few games on for your daughter. I hope you don't mind.
Of course not.
Sure. We've got a modem line hooked up with the data base in New York.
Can we correlate data? Look for specific things, like player's ages... stuff like that?

No problem. We're in.
No problem. We're in.
Okay. Run a search to see if there are any players with a rating above two thousand that live on the Island.
Nope. Nothing.
Set up some pieces on the big board?
D2-d4... b1-c3... and c1-f4. It's the number two variation of the Tarakoss opening. David, can you bring up the tournament records for the last ten years.
Mister Sanderson, they'll be hundreds of thousands of games.
Now what?
Have computer search for anyone that's used that opening against me. There can't be more than a handful.
There's three. The first is 1983. Lionel Baines. The Boston...
Never mind. He died two years ago.
Never mind. He died two years ago.
1985. Hans Korshaud.
1985. Hans Korshaud.
He's in his seventies and lives in Holland.
What is it?
New York. 1986. Viktor Yurilivich.
Computers. That's how you got into Homesearchers records. You can get into anything. But why? Why?
You still haven't figured it out, have you? You think that I've put you through an ordeal. My scars run so much deeper than yours.
You still haven't figured it out, have you? You think that I've put you through an ordeal. My scars run so much deeper than yours.
What scars?
What scars?
The scars on your chest. From where I stabbed you with my fountain pen.
You might not have done it had you known.
You're damn right! I'm a child psychologist and you send me into a room with someone who could be a murderer!

Would you mind keeping your voice down? I have guests.

Oh, well we wouldn't want to disturb your guests, would we?
The police came to me for help. What could I do?
You could have been honest with me for starters. We work together. I have to be able to trust you.

I admit I handled it badly. Sanderson wasn't going to talk to me... but you're young, attractive--
I admit I handled it badly. Sanderson wasn't going to talk to me... but you're young, attractive--
--the same type as the girl who got killed. Jesus, Alan, the guy could be a psychopath.

They asked who would be best suited for this and you--
They asked who would be best suited for this and you--
Don't patronize me! You sent me into a potentially dangerous situation and didn't warn me!
It worked out alright, didn't it?
Fuck off!
Feeling better?
I just can't believe it.
I just can't believe it.
You don't want to believe it. It's a normal reaction.
You don't want to believe it. It's a normal reaction.
How come the police never had a record of Sanderson before. This doesn't come out of nowhere, there has to be a history.
Kathy, please. You're going to wear a hole in the carpet.
I'm just nervous. Sorry.
I'm just nervous. Sorry.
You're safe. He wouldn't come here.
You're safe. He wouldn't come here.
He already did once.
Why did he?
Why did he what?
Why did he what?
Come here.
Come here.
He was watching you.
He was watching you.
Yeah -- that's what we've always thought -- but what if he wasn't? What if I had nothing to do with the reason he came here?
Yeah -- that's what we've always thought -- but what if he wasn't? What if I had nothing to do with the reason he came here?
You're losing me.
You must be Erica.
Uh huh.
Uh huh.
I'm Kathy.
Is your dad here?
He went down to the lobby for a minute. He should be right back. Would you like come in?
So, are you having a good time on the Island?
Not really. It's pretty boring.
Not really. It's pretty boring.
That's only because you don't know where to go. You like hiking? Fishing? Sailing? What do you like?
That's only because you don't know where to go. You like hiking? Fishing? Sailing? What do you like?
Boys.
Do you like my dad?
Of course.
I know he really likes you.
How do you know that? Did he say something?
How do you know that? Did he say something?
No... but I can tell. A woman knows these things.
Okay. Nice meeting you.
Nice meeting you.
Congratulations, dad.
My cheering section.
What are you doing up?
I can't sleep. My beds lumpy.
I can't sleep. My beds lumpy.
I see. You forgot to bring you're night-light, didn't you?

That has nothing to do with it.

You want to sleep in my bed tonight?

Okay.
Who told you that?
Mrs. Lutz. She also told me that Mr. Lutz goes to a medium to try and contact great Grandmasters in the spirit world.

Has he gotten through to any?
Has he gotten through to any?
No, but he did contact a dead parcheesi champion from Ohio.
What is it, dad?
Nothing.
Don't you have something you want to say to David?
Thanks, David.
You ready?
For what?
For what?
You told me you'd take me over to Seattle today.
You told me you'd take me over to Seattle today.
I'm sorry, honey, I can't. Not today.
I'm sorry, honey, I can't. Not today.
But you promised.
It isn't Kathy.
Who's Kathy?
Whaddaya got, Nolan?
Not much. There's no sign of a break in. I think she let him in.
Not much. There's no sign of a break in. I think she let him in.
How long has she been dead?
How long has she been dead?
Six, eight hours tops.
Six, eight hours tops.
Any sign of rape?
Any sign of rape?
Not that I can see. We'll know more once I get the lab reports back from Seattle.
There's no blood. Where's the fuckin' blood?
Bingo.
Anything?
Not much. I don't think she was raped. There's no bruising, or any signs of trauma to the pelvic region -- and no trace of sperm which makes sense because she took a bath.

What about prints?
What about prints?
No prints.
No prints.
You mean, no prints but hers?
You mean, no prints but hers?
No Frank. No prints.
He tapes their mouths shut. We found traces of adhesive around the victims mouths. We're doing a chemical analysis for components, but it's probably a standard brand you can buy in any hardware store.
There's only two hardware stores on the whole Island. We'll check that out. What about the blood?
There's only two hardware stores on the whole Island. We'll check that out. What about the blood?
Not a drop. Maybe the guy works for the Red Cross.
This is where he forced his way in. We found some fibers on the windowsill, probably particles of clothing that rubbed off when he climbed through. I'll know more once I get it under the microscope.
That's great.
That's great.
Wait, I've saved the best for last. Andy, hit the lights, will you?
Same as the others?
Yeah.
Yeah.
How long she been dead?
How long she been dead?
I'd say at least eighteen hours.
I'd say at least eighteen hours.
That means she was dead before we even finished figuring out the message.
Well?
Well what? I told you this was a stupid idea. You can't learn anything from someone in a few minutes.
Well what? I told you this was a stupid idea. You can't learn anything from someone in a few minutes.
You didn't pick up any vibes from the guy?

I'm a psychologist, Frank... not a psychic. What's this all about anyway?
I'm a psychologist, Frank... not a psychic. What's this all about anyway?
What did Dr. Fulton tell you?
Only that you wanted someone from the institute to talk to Sanderson for some case you're working on. What'd he do?
We're not sure.
We're not sure.
What do you think he did?
What do you think he did?
We think he could be a suspect in a murder investigation.
I'm busy right now.
It's important.
I see you're still having problems with your openings.
And this Jeremy--
And this Jeremy--
--Edmonds. I know. You lost to Karpov in '82, didn't you?
No. I told him to. I wanted to make sure there was someone on the other end.
But we heard him.
But we heard him.
It could have been a tape. A prerecorded conversation between Sanderson and himself.
Kathy?
Well, the fact that he views this as a game suggests that he is trying to prove some sense of superiority -- and the way he murders confirms a need to be in complete control of his victim.
Well, the fact that he views this as a game suggests that he is trying to prove some sense of superiority -- and the way he murders confirms a need to be in complete control of his victim.
What about the way he arranged the body?
That would indicate he's playing out a fantasy. Power-control killers usually fantasize about their actions long before they commit them. Once they become a reality though, they reach a sense of euphoria and need to repeat the act to sustain it. But, in all the research I've read on Serial Killers, I've never heard of one moving so fast. It's as if the game
Anything else?
Anything else?
Yes. Why disguise your voice if no one knows it?
Yes. Why disguise your voice if no one knows it?
I was thinking the same thing. He must be local. It's logical for him to assume that the police would be there, but he recognized Andy's voice and called him by name. What about this?
I was thinking the same thing. He must be local. It's logical for him to assume that the police would be there, but he recognized Andy's voice and called him by name. What about this?
I would think it's some type of clue as to where he's going to kill next?
I don't think it matters. Last nights victim, Christie Eastman was found in a warehouse on the outskirts of town. The night before, Debi Rutlege was found in the center.
Meaning?
His home would be... Mount Olympus.
Call dispatch. Double the patrols. I want that area blanketed.
Before we go in I gotta tell you this isn't going to be pretty.
I know that. I've seen the photo's.
I know that. I've seen the photo's.
This ain't no photo.
You never know how you're going to catch a suspect.
Peter's right, Captain. He's got to be forced into making a mistake.
Well, I think you have to play to his ego. He thinks he's superior. The more secure he feels, the more chances he'll take.
What did he mean by Huxley?
Maybe we should back up a minute and take a look at what we do have. All the girls that have been killed have been killed at night. They're all the same type. All moved into their homes within the last three months -- and all of them found their homes through Homesearchers.
I thought that Homesearchers was a dead end?
I thought that Homesearchers was a dead end?
It can't be a coincidence. The woman that owns it has a son. She says he's been on vacation in Montana for the last ten days. We're trying to locate him. There's also a cleaning service that comes in once a week. We're checking that out too.

He moves around a lot. Why?
Each of those grids represents almost a square mile.
That's a big area to cover.
As large as castles.
Yes. Why not just say a building if he meant any general type of structure?
What time did he get there?
About a quarter to one.
He's right, Kathy.
What are you saying? That I'm seeing what I want to see? That I'm protecting a murderer? What?
We can't rely on your judgement anymore.
What does that mean?
And what if he's wrong. If you were one hundred percent sure it was Peter you would've arrested him. If it is someone else then he's going to kill again tonight and you're sitting here ignoring the message.
We're going to work on the message.
We're going to work on the message.
This stinks! You want to know what I think? I think there have been five murders and you've got shit to go on. You need to blame someone and he's the easiest choice.

The most logical choice.

You don't have a shred of evidence!
Did you see his face?
No. He was wearing a mask... but I saw the cut on his wrist. It was Peter.

I can't arrest someone for having a cut on their wrist. Do you have someone you can stay with tonight?

I've got a room at the institute I use when I stay late.

Okay. Why don't you go out there. We'll check in with you later.
If you can think of anything else give us a call.
You know, I hate to say I told you so, but I warned her. Coming home at all hours of the night. A young girl new to the city. This neighborhood ain't what it used to be.
Excuse me... you said earlier that Mary Albert just moved in. How long ago was that?
Ten days ago.
Ten days ago.
Do you know how she found the apartment?
Do you know how she found the apartment?
Through a rental agency.
Through a rental agency.
Didn't you tell me that Debi Rutlege had just moved into her place also?
I know you're busy so I'll get right to it. Did you know her?
Only in passing. To say hello to.
Could you tell me where you were last night?
Here. I played Gregory Lutz.
Here. I played Gregory Lutz.
I know. You won two games against him and left the auditorium at eight forty five. Where did you go after that?
I know. You won two games against him and left the auditorium at eight forty five. Where did you go after that?
To my room and then I went for a walk.
This is a printout from the hotel computer for all the messages logged to your room. Here's one at 9:04 pm. It says: From Debi. Please call me at home.
She called to give me my schedule for tomorrow.
She called to give me my schedule for tomorrow.
What's interesting about it is you say you only knew her in passing. Yet, she says on her message for you to call her at home and she doesn't leave a number. That would imply you already knew the number.

I got it from the tournament directory.
Why didn't you tell us you were there earlier?
I don't know. I was afraid there'd be hours of questions. I can't afford to miss a game.
Mister Sanderson, this is Doctor Sheppard. She's a psychologist helping us out.
We've already met. Haven't we... Doctor.
You want me to go with you? Maybe I can help.
That's alright. We'll take it from here.
What have you come up with on the riddle?
"Wee Willie Winkie runs though the street." We think he might be making a reference to himself.

Maybe, but I don't think so. I think it's just a tease.
Maybe, but I don't think so. I think it's just a tease.
Upstairs and downstairs in his night gown -- He could be saying the house he's picked is two stories.
That's it?
We think he might be making a reference to drugs? Miss Emma is a street term used by junkies for Morphine.
We think he might be making a reference to drugs? Miss Emma is a street term used by junkies for Morphine.
Could Emma be the name of the girl he's going to kill?
Another one? What word did he leave?
"Is". Did you tell him about the institute?
As large as castles. You are still light as air, one hundred men can't move me.
It doesn't make sense.
He's using the map as a chessboard! The sonofabitch is playing chess with me!!
How can he be playing Chess with you? You're not making any moves against him.
How can he be playing Chess with you? You're not making any moves against him.
Maybe I already have.
I still don't see how he could be playing chess against you. There's only enough grids on the map to be half a board.
That's all he needs. He's making the moves. It's an opening. I just can't remember the name. Okay, it's a game. He's starting it, so he moves first. He's white. e2-e4.
It's a commercial area. No one lives there.
But he had to dump the body there to make the move.
As large as castles, you are still light as the air, one hundred men can't move me. It's posed as a question. What am I?
A building?
A building?
A building isn't as light as air. What's large, but as light as air and can't be moved?
He's not going to give us direct hints. He's going to skirt around it.
He uses castles...plural -- then says "can't move me." Singular. Not can't move us.
A shadow. What's as big a castle? As light as air , but one hundred men can't move it? The shadow of the castle. Are there any buildings that have the name Castle in it that cast a shadow long enough to fall across another building?
Wait a minute. There's an apartment in that area called the Castle Arms.
Wait a minute. There's an apartment in that area called the Castle Arms.
That's got to be it.
Where were you last night?
Are we going to go through this again?

I went out.
Jeremy would have never killed himself.
Maybe he just got tired of covering for you.
Maybe he just got tired of covering for you.
This is insane! Can't you see what's going on. The killer wants me out of the way. He's setting me up.
Don't you understand what I'm telling you? That's why he wants me out of the way.
I understand that this is just another one of your games.
I understand that this is just another one of your games.
Look, I'll do anything you want! I'll sign anything you want! Just send a car out to the hotel.
Alright, c'mon Peter. We're moving you to a cell.
I signed the confession. What about the car?
Did you send the car?
It's over, Peter. Let's stop the games. I'm not sending a car.
You opened with the English. Lutz won't use it. He opened his first game with it.
He knows you're aware of that.

You sure you don't want to eat something?
I don't think I could.

Let's change the subject.
Let's change the subject.
Okay. So, tell me about yourself. Are you married?
I'm just curious.
I think it's best if we don't ask too many personal questions -- I want to keep things on a professional level.

You mean like in the steam room?
You mean like in the steam room?
That's not fair!
That's not fair!
Are you going to tell me you didn't feel something in there?
You're projecting your own desires and reading more into what happened than what actually did.
Very good. Spoken like a true psychologist. When confronted with the prospect of your own reality, hide behind quotations. What is that Masters and Johnson?
You have to win every point, don't you?
I just wanted to know if you're involved with anyone? Let me ask you something? Do your colleagues know if you're involved or not?
I just wanted to know if you're involved with anyone? Let me ask you something? Do your colleagues know if you're involved or not?
Of course.
Of course.
Why?
Why?
Because I work with them.
No.
You're not?
You're not?
No -- I'm not involved. And I plan on keeping it that way.
Relax.
How the hell can I relax after seeing what I just saw.

I know it was bad.

How could you? Unless you were there.
I know you didn't
You know, Andy thinks you're doing this.
You know, Andy thinks you're doing this.
Doesn't that scare you?
Doesn't that scare you?
No.
No.
Why?
Why?
Because I think he's wrong.
Can you go fifteen minutes without thinking about it?
No. But I'm open to distractions.
No. But I'm open to distractions.
I'm sure you are.
You know, you're not the easiest person in the world to get close to.
You always want to talk about me. What about you?
You always want to talk about me. What about you?
Wasn't I just talking about me?
Wasn't I just talking about me?
No. You were talking about chess.
No. You were talking about chess.
Alright. What about me?

I dunno. Where's Erica mother?

She died in a car accident.

I'm sorry.

It's alright. It was a long time ago.
It's alright. It was a long time ago.
It must've been very hard on Erica?

It was.

And you?
What?
Have you noticed that every time we start to talk about something serious you start to play games.

I'm not playing a game now.
I'm not playing a game now.
Yes you are. You're playing word games.
Yes you are. You're playing word games.
What is this?
What is this?
I'm just trying to get to know you, Peter.
I'm just trying to get to know you, Peter.
What? By attacking me?
Nobody could attack you. You set your life up like one of your chessboards. You're impregnable -- but at the same time you've become trapped behind your own defenses. You're cut off from everyone around you.
What are you talking about? You don't even know me.
What are you talking about? You don't even know me.
Does anyone?
I just don't want to fight with you.
Then show me who you are.
This frightens me -- because I'm starting to feel things I haven't felt in a long time.
You've got to face the things you feel.
You've got to face the things you feel.
I thought you were the woman who didn't want to get involved.
I thought you were the woman who didn't want to get involved.
I said I didn't plan on getting involved.
You can turn everything around so easily. This is not just another game, is it?
No.
I'm hungry.
Call room service.
Fine.
What do you want on it?
What do you want on it?
You.
You.
Would you settle for pepperoni?
Would you settle for pepperoni?
If I have to. I'm going to take a shower.
Did you call?
The line was busy. I'll try again.
They're not delivering. I'm going to go pick up the pizza.
I thought you said the line was busy?
I thought you said the line was busy?
I tried again and got through.
I tried again and got through.
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Nothing.
Then why are you backing up?
Peter, you have to admit--
--admit what? That I was right about you in the steam room? That you're willing to do anything to find out what you want? Would you like me to leave so you can search the rest of the room?
Peter...
How could you think that, Kathy? How could you even consider it?
In a fierce magazine you'll find a hint of my actions to come... Why does he set this line apart?
For emphasis?
For emphasis?
Exactly. It's the key.
Exactly. It's the key.
But what does he mean by a fierce magazine? Violent?
But what does he mean by a fierce magazine? Violent?
A fierce magazine... brutal... An angry magazine... A war magazine... a mercenary magazine... fierce... Mad.

What?
What?
Where's the note?
He's replaying the game I played against him move by move, using these girls as the Chess pieces. All the girls have been found in their homes except Christie Eastman, who was found in back of a warehouse. Why?
Because to follow the game he played he had to move to that grid?
Because to follow the game he played he had to move to that grid?
Right. Here! c-4.
Hi.
Can I come in?
The other night -- I said some things that maybe I shouldn't have. I mean, you haven't known me very long and I can see how you thought what you did.
I'm not looking for an apology, Peter.
I'm not looking for an apology, Peter.
I was thinking that... maybe when this is all over we could...
I was thinking that... maybe when this is all over we could...
I want someone I can get close to. I don't know if that's possible with you.
I want someone I can get close to. I don't know if that's possible with you.
You really haven't seen my best side.
Peter...
No, listen. You have no idea of the kind of pressure I'm under right now.
No, listen. You have no idea of the kind of pressure I'm under right now.
That's still no excuse. You treat everything like a game.
That's still no excuse. You treat everything like a game.
I can't think any more, unless it's about you. I'll be in the middle of a match and instead of thinking about my next move, I think about how you look when you smile. Remember how you said that I hide behind my chessboard? Ever since my wife died I've been... I've been afraid of getting too close to someone again -- afraid of

You don't understand.

Then help me to understand. I want to understand.
Then help me to understand. I want to understand.
It's not that easy.

Of course it isn't. It's always difficult when someone you love dies. But you can't feel responsible because she had a car accident.
Of course it isn't. It's always difficult when someone you love dies. But you can't feel responsible because she had a car accident.
But I do.
But I do.
Why?
Why?
Because she killed herself!!
This letter. I've never opened it.
Why not?
Why not?
Because I know what it says.
Because I know what it says.
Maybe you're afraid of what it says.
If we could just figure out what the next word is going to be. He said the game's going to end tonight so there's only going to be one more word.
It could be anything.
It could be anything.
It's got to be grammatically correct.
How did you know it was "carefully"?
Frank told me.
Frank told me.
No he didn't.
You're right. The killer told me.
He didn't tell you either.
This isn't going to be like the phone book, is it?
Of course not.
You're going to be late for your match.
Are you going to come tonight?
Are you going to come tonight?
Yeah. I'll be there later.
You beat him.
I got lucky.
I got lucky.
There's a girl in the hospital who is going to live because of you. You made a difference.
It's over now.
I just wanted you to know in case you thought about it in the future.
I just wanted you to know in case you thought about it in the future.
Do we have a future?
Hello, Peter. You played an interesting game last night. Even though sacrificing your Queen at b-5 is the game I played against Valsney in '82. I'm glad it helped you.
I'm sure you are.
I'm sure you are.
No, I want you to do good. That way when I beat you at the end I'll look that much better.
No, I want you to do good. That way when I beat you at the end I'll look that much better.
You're getting sloppy, Yurilivich. You're nervous?

I'm not nervous.

Well, you should be, because this time I'm going to win.
Well, you should be, because this time I'm going to win.
Well, then this time you'll have to stay for the whole match, won't you?
I'm sorry. I couldn't help it.
I don't have to go through with it either.
I don't have to go through with it either.
You don't understand. I'm just so <u>relieved</u>. I was <u>sure</u> you'd turn out to be short and fat and gimpy.
You don't understand. I'm just so <u>relieved</u>. I was <u>sure</u> you'd turn out to be short and fat and gimpy.
Oh. That. I know what you mean. I had nightmares all week.

Last night was the worst. I dreamt you had one leg shorter than the other, and walked like a penguin.

You're really not bad looking. Almost handsome.

If you're going to marry a warrior, you'd best get used to it.

I have no intention of getting used to it.
Take off your clothes. I'm going to scrub you down.

We're almost married.
We're almost married.
We're not married <u>yet</u>.
We're not married <u>yet</u>.
Well, then you can go up to the parapet and I'll hand the buckets up to you.
I don't trust you to wash behind your ears.
Never mind my ears! Go away!
There. Now you look like someone I might want to marry.
Maybe you'd better look around for another candidate. I don't think my skin is tough enough to survive a lifetime of you and your brush.
Maybe you'd better look around for another candidate. I don't think my skin is tough enough to survive a lifetime of you and your brush.
I don't have to look around. I've found the husband I want. You can kiss me now.

Thank you, but I can wait.
Thank you, but I can wait.
I can't.
I lied.
About what?
About what?
I can't wait either.
Lyssa ... Lyssa ...
Colwyn.
Have they harmed you?
No. They watch me closely, but they haven't harmed me.
Lyssa. Where are they keeping you?
In a great fortress in the mountains. Wait. Something's happening.
Lyssa ...
Colwyn ...
Colwyn ...
Where is the Fortress?
Where is the Fortress?
I don't know. It's a maze of tunnels. I can't see out.

I will find you. I will be with you.

I know it.

I love you, Lyssa, I love you ...
I love you, Lyssa, I love you ...
Colwyn. Colwyn. I love you, Colwyn.

You must move away from the Center.

All the passages are guarded.
Will your power outward.
I don't know how.
I don't know how.
You have the power. <u>Will it</u>.
Take the western passage.
All directions are the same here.
Yes.
Move quickly. We are coming for you. We are in the Fortress.
Move quickly. We are coming for you. We are in the Fortress.
I knew you would come.
Lyssa ...
Come quickly, Colwyn. I can see the eyes of the Beast.
In the Arctic ice.
That way. I can feel the cold.
That's a better one.
Yes.
You'll both wait. At least for five hours. The wedding is at three.
It was a platonic kiss, Father.
It was a platonic kiss, Father.
Of course it was.
They have Lyssa!
You can't reach her! Through the door. Quickly!
You will go alone.
I won't leave you here.
I won't leave you here.
You will do as I tell you. You will try to reach Ynyr, the old one.
You will do as I tell you. You will try to reach Ynyr, the old one.
I must follow the Slayers. They've taken Lyssa.
I must follow the Slayers. They've taken Lyssa.
You will not follow the Slayers, you will obey my command! You have no chance alone, boy. You must try to break through to Ynyr. He has great knowledge. Only with his help can you save Lyssa.
The White Castle has fallen.
Does the Queen live?
Does the Queen live?
The new Queen lives.
The new Queen lives.
Turold's son was to marry her.

We were married. Then she was taken by the Slayers. You must help me.
We were married. Then she was taken by the Slayers. You must help me.
I have lived in this place, like my fathers before me, guarding the old knowledge. I knew, when I had no son, that the Great War would come in my time, and that I would be the one to pass on the old knowledge to a new king. Come.
This is not the first time the Dark Ones have attacked our world. They came once before, a thousand years ago. A young king and queen, with extraordinary powers, were given to us then, to lead the struggle. My fore-father was their Councilor, as I will be yours.
I have no extraordinary powers.

Your powers are greater than you know. Have you ever seen one of these?
Your powers are greater than you know. Have you ever seen one of these?
In the old books. It's called a glaive.
With two or three days' practice, you'll be able to use it as well as I can. Then we'll have a chance of fighting our way out of here.
Two or three days! While Lyssa is in their hands?
Two or three days! While Lyssa is in their hands?
There is no other way.

But there is another entrance to this place.
But it opens onto the sheer wall of the Needle. There's no way down.
You have rope?

I am too old to climb down a rope.

You won't have to.
There is nothing.
Reach out farther. Call to her.
Reach out farther. Call to her.
Lyssa ... Lyssa ...
You must break when the strain becomes too great, or you will harm yourself. And you must concentrate your powers for when they are needed most. What did she answer?
She was in a great fortress, first in the mountains, then in the jungle. How is that possible?
She was in a great fortress, first in the mountains, then in the jungle. How is that possible?
It is the Fortress of Krull. I know it only from the stories of wars on other worlds. They did not use it on our world in the first great war, for it costs them enormous power. This time they mean to conquer, at all costs.

The Fortress moves?
The Fortress moves?
Yes. Each dawn it rises in a different land: sometimes in the mountains, sometimes in the jungle, sometimes the desert, sometimes the sea. Never in the same place twice.
Yes. Each dawn it rises in a different land: sometimes in the mountains, sometimes in the jungle, sometimes the desert, sometimes the sea. Never in the same place twice.
Then even if Lyssa tells us where she is, we'll never be able to reach her, for they will never allow the Fortress to rise near us.
Then even if Lyssa tells us where she is, we'll never be able to reach her, for they will never allow the Fortress to rise near us.
No. They occupy the Fortress, but they cannot control its movement. It is moved by Fate. And, sooner or later, Fate will place it near us.
No. They occupy the Fortress, but they cannot control its movement. It is moved by Fate. And, sooner or later, Fate will place it near us.
Then we must be ready. Five leagues from here is the Eastern Tower. I know the Barons who hold it. Good men, and brave. They will help us.

You have not slept in two days.
You have not slept in two days.
Nor will I, till my bride is beside me.
You choose these?
Yes. They will be more help than high-born barons.
They know when they're going to die?
Everyone of his race is born knowing the day of his death.
I can't reach her.
What do you see?
What do you see?
Darkness. Tunnels and corridors. Wait.
She can't see out. She can't tell us where the Fortress is.
Yes, they knew of your first contact, so they drove her below.
Yes, they knew of your first contact, so they drove her below.
She was very faint. I was barely able to reach her.
She was very faint. I was barely able to reach her.
The deeper she goes, the harder it is to contact her. Once she is below the second level, you will not be able to reach her at all.
The deeper she goes, the harder it is to contact her. Once she is below the second level, you will not be able to reach her at all.
I will find her!
I cannot reach her.
She is too deep. The curved tunnel we saw is part of the Vortex, the place of The Beast.
The first time, when they attacked long ago, was The Beast here?
No. Then they were led by his underlings. But I knew he had come this time, from the ferocity of their onslaught, from their use of The Fortress. They use up much of their strength to do these things. They are taking great risks.
No. Then they were led by his underlings. But I knew he had come this time, from the ferocity of their onslaught, from their use of The Fortress. They use up much of their strength to do these things. They are taking great risks.
<u>Why</u>?

I'm not sure.
I'm not sure.
But you suspect.
But you suspect.
You will know, in good time.
No. We will find another way to locate the Fortress.
There is no other way. You asked me why the Beast had come this time.
There is no other way. You asked me why the Beast had come this time.
Yes.
Yes.
He has come for Lyssa.
He has come for Lyssa.
Lyssa? <u>Why</u>?

Like you, she has extraordinary powers. He would make her his Queen.

Can she be forced?

Never.

You are young. You don't understand the attraction of great power, and you forget the pain of long waiting.
You are young. You don't understand the attraction of great power, and you forget the pain of long waiting.
Then we must reach her before she feels that pain.
Then we must reach her before she feels that pain.
Yes.
Traitor! She'll marry you in hell!
He thinks you betray him with Lyssa. Colwyn! The waters deceive you!
I will melt that gold and pour it down your throat, old man!
He sees betrayal everywhere. He will attack us so long as he is conscious.
From here, I must go alone.
You will tell me her name and we will go together.
You will tell me her name and we will go together.
You must never know her name. If more than one approaches, she will certainly kill them. Alone I may have a chance.
He ran a great risk, helping us today. If he opposes his fate, his death will be terribly painful.
Let us wish him peace.
They will hold Lyssa in the Center of the Vortex, the place of the Beast, where its power is greatest. No man can match it there. Lyssa must try to move toward us. For as we enter the Vortex and move closer ...
The Beast will kill her.
The Beast will kill her.
Yes. To keep her from you. But now that we are inside the Fortress, you will be able to contact her.
She must make a glaive.
Lyssa, your bracelets. Bend them straight and cross them.
The spiral begins in the west.
Where the spiral begins.
She's on the other side of this wall. I can feel it!
I chose the wrong passage.

Use your sword.

What use is my sword? I can't reach her!
What use is my sword? I can't reach her!
Cut. <u>Cut</u>!
You must move quickly. The Beast will stop at nothing now.
You're coming with us.
You're coming with us.
It is my fate to die in the Fortress.

No! You cannot know that!

I can. Because I choose it.
I can. Because I choose it.
I forbid you!
How did you know?
I found the body of the Seer in the stream.
Slayers!
We must enter the swamp.
Do not let the waters touch you.
What will happen?
They can be saddled.
You have done it?

I road them often in my youth.

One night is no betrayal. Have pity on me. Please, I beg you, do not refuse me. You do not know the price.
I feel your pain, but I cannot betray her.
You will not, then?

I cannot.

No more, my lord - my friend. With Ergo the Magnificent by your side, your enemies are dead men.
Not yet, my friend. It's your tomato that's dying.

Try your tricks on me and I'll turn myself back into a snake and bite you.
You and I will guard the fire.

Smart as well as quick. Now what do you have to give us?
Smart as well as quick. Now what do you have to give us?
Fame.
Fame.
Fame? Thank you, no. Fame is the burial ground of contentment. Eat it and go hungry; count it and go broke; seek it and grow mad. Fame is what fools yearn for and wise men shun.

They stand at the edge of the grave and make jokes. Do you know who I am, sprout? I am Torquil, Lord of the forest. My men follow no man but me, and I follow no man at all.
You will follow me.
You will follow me.
And in the few seconds before I dice you to crow-food, tell me why I am going to follow you.

They burn many villages. Even walled cities fall to them.
Why do they burn the villages? There's nothing to gain.
I'm not hungry.
Not sleepy, either?
Not sleepy, either?
No.
Forgive me. It's childish to cry.
Those are not child's tear. A child cries for himself, a man cries for those he loves.
Well, I'm not impressed.
I knew you would not be. That's why I chose you.
You've eaten nothing.

Go. I command you.
Go. I command you.
Yes, my lord.
We could reach it on fire-mares.
Those beasts cannot be saddled by mortal men.
We must cover a hundred leagues before sunrise.
At the gallop!
You're resourceful, my lad. I tell you, one year under my tutelage and I could make you the Prince of Thieves.
Subject to the King, no doubt.
Subject to the King, no doubt.
Naturally.
A good thrust, my friend. Another second and there'd have been nothing between my head and shoulders but bad memories.
I intend to keep you alive, your majesty. So you can abdicate your throne and become my Warlord.

Perhaps. If the pay is good.
Make for the wall. I'll catch up.
Colwyn, don't be a fool. You can't do battle with that thing.
Colwyn, don't be a fool. You can't do battle with that thing.
There's no way to outrun it. You know that. This is what Ynyr was preparing me for. It's what he died for.
Nothing worse than lower-class boors with upper-class morals.
Would you settle for a boar?
Would you settle for a boar?
A <u>boar</u>? Those incompetent louts couldn't catch a piglet, much less a boar.
You!
Me. May I eat with you tonight?

Tonight and every night, my friend, for this is the second time you've saved my life. I am Ergo the Magnificent, short in stature, tall in power, etcetera, etcetera.

What is that awful looking place?
The Swamp of Betrayal. Be glad we don't have to cross it.

Where are you going?
We'll meet you at the inn.

Can't I come, too?

No.
A venison pie as big as a house.
A small house.
A small house.
And what do you think a small person lives in, you one-eyed fool? Leaving me here to mope while you and the boy were arranging my assassination.
Quell?
I cannot go with you, my friend.
My heart stays here.
And mine goes with you.
Bread is for peasants, and wine makes me sneeze. Got any gumdrops?
No.
No.
Sugarballs?

No.
No.

I ... ... am Titch.
I'm hungry.
Smart lad. Bring me my spices!
If I could wish ... ... for anything, I'd wish for a venison pie the size of a ... ... mountain. No, that's too greedy. I'd settle for one the size of a house.
I'd wish for a puppy.
I'd wish for a puppy.
One puppy? Why not wish for a hundred?

I only want one.
I only want one.
A foolish wish. And you, Quell?
Sir Ergo? ... My honorable Lord Ergo? ...
First, you desert me, and now you mock me. Go back to your one-eyed friend.
What? Now you poke me in the nose as well?
I don't think it's working.
I don't think it's working.
Not working? This nose? This nose works day and night. This nose has never loafed an hour in its life. This nose ... What? Impossible. This nose asleep while venison fills the air? Where is it, boy? Tell me where it is and I forgive you everything.

It's right behind you.
We meant only to please you.
And do you think I'm not going to eat myself to death this very night? Huh?
Oh, she was so beautiful - and I was so <u>ugly</u>.
Would you desert your friends?
Would you desert your friends?
No, no. I'm with you, boy.
But also very young. Six to one is no odds, boy.
Get me down from here you louts or I'll turn you all into pigs!
Put me down, you lout!
You had better manners as a pig.
You had better manners as a pig.
I am Ergo the Magnificent, and I do not travel with thieves and robbers.

I must take the old man to see some sick children. Kegan will guard you.

Passable, pimple, very passable.
The greatest boon of your otherwise worthless life, blockhead, is the privilege of dining on boar roasted by the hand of Ergo the Magnificent.

Your boast is a bigger mouthful than your roast, Magnificence.
I can't hold the weight of both of you!
Hush!
Look at its beauty. Look at its grace.
Look at its insides.
Look at its insides.
No! Not yet! Let me hug it and kiss it a little. Let me run my fingers over its lovely skin. Let me climb to the top and sing to it.
My spells always go wrong when I am observed. Be gone!

One with red eyes, the other with one eye, both trying to kill me.
The one with red eyes was a Dark One, the other was a Cyclops, and it was not you he meant to kill.

He was aiming a huge spear right at me!
He was aiming a huge spear right at me!
If that were so, you'd be dead now. He was aiming at the Dark One, for there is ancient hatred between them. Once his race had two eyes, like other men, until his forefathers bargained with the Dark Ones: they gave up one of their eyes in return for the power to see the future. But they were cheated, for the only future they

And who is <u>he</u> that they should join <u>him</u>?

Well, at least I'm glad to see you have a sense of humor. That's the first smile I've seen on that gloomy face of your's ... ... isn't it? It isn't. Oh no. Oh dear. Oh now I've gone and done it.
They'll trample him to death!
No. He will master the leader.
I do not want your power. It is hideous.
You know nothing of power, you foolish girl. You think power is a mighty sword, or a strong castle, or the paltry magic of an Emerald Seer. Power is none of these.
I do not want your worlds or your slaves.
Then look!
It's a lie!
These walls do not lie! He will betray you.
These walls do not lie! He will betray you.
He will not!
He will not!
Then he will die!
He will come for me.
He will not come. You will be my queen.
What news from our friends?
Barak is still strong in the north, and Tendo holds the high passes. But the great desert forts have fallen.

The attacks are unceasing: by night, the Dark Ones; by day, those of our people who have sold themselves to them, those traitors who are called the Slayers.

We will hold. Their power is not unlimited.
Lord Rowan is one of Lyssa's godfathers. He will defend her in the ceremony. I wish that Lord Modred were here. He is a godfather of her own blood.
Modred has treated with the Dark Ones.
For some, the lure of power is stronger than the ties of blood. No matter. I had hoped to have the wedding next spring, Lord Turold, with all the nobles of the kingdom in attendance. But Fate and this war have ordained otherwise.
It is important to assure the succession.
It is important to assure the succession.
Yes.
I will tell you something you did not know, Turold. Had it been my choice, all those years ago, I would have chosen you for my king. But my parents chose otherwise.
I knew.
I knew.
You knew! You are a rude bumpkin!

That I am, my lady.
A girl of some spirit, your daughter.
A match for your son, I think.

A fine match.

They will have the life that you and I might have had.
You were attacked in the forest?
Yes. We lost five.
Yes. We lost five.
You were lucky. I lost thirty there.
I tried to reach Ynyr, the old one. I led a hundred men to his place in Granite Needle, but it was surrounded. The Dark Ones guard it by night and by day they call out the Slayers. Ynyr cannot get out and no one can get in.
How many did you lose?
How many did you lose?
Sixty at the needle, another thirty in the forest. Only ten of us made it back.
Sixty at the needle, another thirty in the forest. Only ten of us made it back.
We will have to try again. His knowledge is great. Without it, we cannot hope to win.
Modred! Impossible!
He leads a group of Slayers, under the leopard banner.
We seek the Fortress of Krull.
Such a vision will be opposed. Who seeks it?

The new King.

With an old voice?

You know the voice.

Yes. You have left your place in the Needle. It is the time, then.
Yes. You have left your place in the Needle. It is the time, then.
It is the time.
It is the time.
I will seek the Fortress for you.
Can you see?
Yes. It is the Western Ocean.
The Dark Ones will appose you with all their power.
They will fail for, during the day, the power of the Circle is greater than theirs. Only at night can they pierce the Circle.
Knowledge I wouldn't want.
No. They are sad, solitary creatures, rarely seen.
We'll seek an Emerald Seer. They have great powers of vision.
There's an Emerald Circle a few leagues from here. We'll find her.
We can save half a day by crossing the Stone Lake.
Many have perished in that maze.
Many have perished in that maze.
No maze to me, my fried. It is where we take refuge when they hunt us.
The leader of the Dark Ones?
Yes. Like you, a King. A King of many worlds. All enslaved.
I must go to the widow. Perhaps she will help.
The Widow of the Web?

Yes.
Yes.

Few have survived it.
Fewer will survive them.
Each to his fate, lad.
Each to his fate. Wait for me at the inn. If I am not back by dawn, you will know my fate, and you must go on without me.
We must reach the Valley of Reeds before the next dawn.
It's a hundred leagues from here.
I'll stay behind and keep them busy.
It is not necessary. They will not follow.
Look.
Yes, they are weakening. It takes great power to maintain the Fortress, and they have expended much.
Kegan!
It is too late. He has drunk.
Go now. Quell was wise. He knew that a man cannot ask more of his death than it help his friends.
That is true.
Who speaks that name!
Ynyr!
It is fifty years since I heard that name.
It is fifty years since I spoke it to you.
It is fifty years since I spoke it to you.
I was beautiful then.

Where is he? My son.

I killed him when he was born. This place is my punishment.
Do not try your trickery on me!
It is no trickery.
It is no trickery.
Those are reflections. <u>This</u> is my face!
You see?
Yes.
Memory is no trick, it is a power. The power to see.
Power you have given me. What can my power give you?

Knowledge.
Knowledge.
Of what?

A young man seeks her. A young man about the age I was when I met you.
Tomorrow, the Fortress of Krull will rise with the sun in the Valley of Reeds. But the knowledge is of no use to you. No man has ever escaped the Web. And soon the creature will come for you, even here.
It will not help.
Then the other Lyssa will share your fate. She will grow old in the Fortress as you have grown old here.
I cannot stop the sand.
You cannot stop time. Go now, before it runs out.

He forgot his money... My mother's got a pub, behind the corner, and he forgot his money, about 100$.
Huh? I see, but this is the FBI, little girl, and I can't let you in. But if you leave me his money, I'll give him it myself.
Give me his name, I will mail him.
OK. Mister Stansfield, Norman STANSFIELD.

Yeah... How do you know it?
Yeah... How do you know it?
...I heard he said... That's all... Thanks.
Yeah, pal! And I didn't say anything, I said I don't know you. But do you know what did she say, that stupid Raphaella?
No?
No?
She told them you wanted her things and that she wasn't surprised police looked for you! Can you believe it?!

Good, what are you going to do? Do you come back?
Good, what are you going to do? Do you come back?
No... I can't... I got tired. I want to live my way.
YEAH! I was sure! Come on, tell me! I know him?
No.
No.
Come on, shit, tell me! Is he beautiful?
I can't believe it! "Yes I think"... How she kids me! I can't believe it! And did he pass your threshold or not?
...What?
...What?
Well... Did you sleep with him or not?
Well... Did you sleep with him or not?
No... Not yet. He's very shy... and very sensitive.
No... Not yet. He's very shy... and very sensitive.
...Good... But what's special in him?
...Good... But what's special in him?
...I don't know... It's true he touches me. I love him.
...You moved too, didn't you?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Huh!? Because of the slaughter at your same floor?
Huh!? Because of the slaughter at your same floor?
...Not at all.
...Not at all.
It's better... You see, it's my turf, so I don't want contracts I'm not informed about, on my turf. I'm not opposing, but the least they can do is informing me, isn't it?

At a certain moment I thought: maybe Leon would like working on his own? So he makes some little extras?
Dirty work, and I kill no women and no kids.
Dirty work, and I kill no women and no kids.
That's what I later told myself! No, Tony, forget Leon! It can't be him, he likes too much his job to make such a slaughter!
Tell me... The money I earn and you keep for me...
Do you need money?
Do you need money?
No... Just to know... Because it's a long time I work... And I never did anything with my money... I should do something.
No, no.
Pay attention to women, Leon. They are dangerous, you know?
Pay attention to women, Leon. They are dangerous, you know?
Yeah... Well... I don't know.. I don't know any.
Yeah... Well... I don't know.. I don't know any.
Listen, think about what you want to do, but don't worry, your money is there and it's safer than in a bank... Banks are robbed every five minutes!
Why can't I have a bank account?
I'll explain you, Leon: they'll ask you to fill in a lot of forms and you can't write and they'll ask you your job, your employer's name and you can't tell them: My job, I'm a hitman and my employer is Tony, his record is longer than his resturant's menu. That's why you can't have a bank account!
Take...
Well, I don't need them...
Well, I don't need them...
Take them, you never know... If you want to have some fun. Take, it's a gift.
OK, I'm fine.
Good.
Here, this is the light scoop for night shooting. There, you fix client's distance... How much to the bench down there in the park?
Huh... 500 meters?
Huh... 500 meters?
130... 140...
130... 140...
How can you say it?
How can you say it?
Look. When you can see his fingers, it's 50 meters. When you just see his hands, it's about 80 meters. When you distinguish arms from body, it's 120-130. When you see nothing more than a shape, you don't shoot. Not very sure. You have one chance out of five to miss. A contract means getting all chances on your side. 5 out of 5.

What, for example?
What, for example?
Well, if the guy is far, in a car, and I know weather is going to be bad, rain for example, I think I would plastic the car, with a remote here. I shoot from the distance and if I miss I plastic.

What if you can't approach the car or he changes car?
Rocket launcher.
Oh really? But can you miss the car?
Wow! It's brilliant!
Yeah... Come on, have a little training.
Who'll I aim at?
Whoever.
The fat man down there, on the bench.
Perfect.
Good! First shot!
Yeah, but I didn't get him, I got his case and now he's behind the tree. What can I do?
Yeah, but I didn't get him, I got his case and now he's behind the tree. What can I do?
It's not serious, it's just training. You have to learn from the beginning to hit the target, then, to improve precision, you'll train, but on cardboards.

OK.
OK.
Now, try a running guy.
The yellow and pink.
OK.
What's up? I don't feel you're concentrated.
Yes, yes...
It's incredible! How did you do it?
What?
What?
There, the guy... How did you do that, without even touching him? Without noise. It's like you put him away... How did you do it?
Five minutes. Keep in front of the window.
OK.
Come on, get down!
You were scared, weren't you?
You were scared, weren't you?
I was nervous, that's all! Where is the guy?
I was nervous, that's all! Where is the guy?
I killed him... and cut him and ate all of him... I left nothing for you!
It's strange, being in love... It's the first time for me...
How do you know it's love, if you've never been in love before?... It may be friendship... or the love you can have with a brother or a father... How can you know?
How do you know it's love, if you've never been in love before?... It may be friendship... or the love you can have with a brother or a father... How can you know?
...Because I feel it.
Mathilda? May I come in?
Yes.
Why don't you take me with you?... I'm ready, now. You said I learn very quickly.
Quick doesn't mean "ready". And you can't discuss, we said. Right?
May I go to the cinema?
No.
No.
For musicals? That's part of the job!
For musicals? That's part of the job!
No, you can't go out.
You see, five minutes ago you said you loved me and now you hate me... but I prefer this!
I hate you because you depart without kissing me. That's all.
...You can leave whenever you want. I don't refrain you.
...This is what I don't like, you see: you don't refrain me, but at the same time I can't get out!
Not taken.
Why?
Why?
Too heavy.
Well... Then may you rent me your gear for the day?
I never rent my gear.
If you knew, Leon...! I killed one thousand in my head... And this never disturbed my sleep.
OK... And if it's you who gets killed? ...Then? Talking about other people's death is easy, but what about yours? She's here! She moves around you, and can get you in a thousandth of second. Because it was your day, your hour, your second...
It's true... But a first contract, it's an exception.
And... May I kiss you, like in the movies, may this be an exception?
...I'm going to kiss you.
Mathilda, stop, please!
Stop. Everyone is looking.
Of course, so kiss me quickly, or they'll notice us.
...You don't believe me, don't you?
What?
What?
When I say I love you.
When I say I love you.
Mathilda, don't resume, please. ....Change subject, OK?
Mathilda, don't resume, please. ....Change subject, OK?
...OK. I love you anyway.
...OK. I love you anyway.
Mathilda?!
Mathilda?!
OK, OK! Excuse me! How old were you when you had your first contract?
OK, OK! Excuse me! How old were you when you had your first contract?
...17.
...Shit!! We'd found him. We waited for him to get upstairs and he got out of the window.
What shall we do?
What shall we do?
I think.
Where are you going?
Piddle. She smiles and looks for the bathroom. She finds it and is going to go in when she sees the head of a man in the bath, walkman on. She withholds a shout and gets against the wall, without moving. She doesn't dare passing before the open door again to join Leon. In the living room, Leon still thinks.

...Why didn't he close the window?
It's cool departing this way... warm... music...
There are better things. You see the importance of the "moment". Ten minutes early or late, he'd have seen death. He'd have suffered it. This way, he already departed. Without knowing.

Mathilda, hadn't you told that bullshit to the receptionist, we'd still be in the hotel, I make you notice.
That wasn't bullshit, I said we love each other.
That wasn't bullshit, I said we love each other.
Yeah!... Anyway, I don't like hotels. Too much people, everyone's got the key... I don't like it.
...I prefer apartments... Furthermore, there are always kids in a building. What about getting some friends?
Friends? You're crazy! In my building, before, they just cared drugs all day and you couldn't get one, or they just cared video games and you couldn't get one, no more.

Is there a normal 13 or 14 year old boy?
Is there a normal 13 or 14 year old boy?
Yeah... There's a lot on TV.
It's too big.
Yeah... I'm just good for left-overs!
Risky business, isn't it?
...You're young, Mathilda... You still have a chance to get out. You can't give up this chance. You have to protect it. There's a lot of things to do in life, a lot of other jobs...
...You're young, Mathilda... You still have a chance to get out. You can't give up this chance. You have to protect it. There's a lot of things to do in life, a lot of other jobs...
There are just two things I'm interested in: love and death. For the moment, I have none of the two!
Mathilda... There's equally a lot of other things!
Huh, really? What? Come on, I'm waiting!
No, excuse me... It's the yogurt that made me laugh.
You've just to love me and I'll be the happiest woman around.
You've just to love me and I'll be the happiest woman around.
Yeah, I know! But for the moment you're not yet a woman. So, be patient... I need time... And you too. You have to grow up.
Yeah, I know! But for the moment you're not yet a woman. So, be patient... I need time... And you too. You have to grow up.
I don't grow up any more. I just get older.
I'm here, I'll never leave you again, Mathilda, never. I swear.
I love you so much, Leon.
I love you so much, Leon.
I love you too, and I don't want to lose you.
Poor darling, and then?
Well... I proposed them to play roulette... Like we played... ...And I lost.
Well... I don't know, suddenly, the make up... All this... How are you? Are you OK?
Of course! I'm fine! I put on your beautiful dress, I slightly made up... I tried to get beautiful! Don't you like it?
...Don't you drink?
I prefer waiting for a while... I feel it would go the wrong way.
...No...
...Don't you like me?
How many girlfriends did you have?
...I don't know.
...I don't know.
Well... 1... 2... 10... 100... 1000? How many, approximately?
Well... 1... 2... 10... 100... 1000? How many, approximately?
...Mathilda, I don't feel like talking about this.
...Mathilda, I don't feel like talking about this.
Why? Did you have too many and you fear it may shock me? I won't get shocked. I'm used to this! My father was a true pig. He fucked the bitch I'd as mother all around the apartment. Whenever a door was closed, you could be sure they were making sex behind it! And my sister, if you didn't sleep with her, you're building's

Stop, Mathilda! Don't talk like that!
...I had a girlfriend... A long time ago. Before coming here, in my country. I was 14-year-old... We flirted like kids... Her father didn't want her to meet me. My family was not very respectable.
Then? You didn't give a shit about her father, didn't you? You met anyway?
...That's awful. I hope you killed, that asshole?
...Yes. The day he got out of jail. I allowed him to make ten steps... No more. And bang. Two hundred meters. By telescope. That night, I left my country and came here, to join my father, who worked for Tony. ...I was 17. Then, I never left the city... And never had another girlfriend...
You... You knock the code, when you come back, OK?
Yes.
Yes.
Three times, then two times.
May I ask you a personal question?
...Yes.
...Yes.
What do you do, with the money you earn?
What do you do, with the money you earn?
Nothing, for the moment.
Nothing, for the moment.
Maybe it's the time to do something, isn't it?
Maybe it's the time to do something, isn't it?
Yeah, what?
Yeah, what?
I don't know... Getting far away, the two of us, for example... And forgetting all this...
Why did you unleash the pipe, I don't know?
It will take them five minutes! How long ago did they arrive?
It will take them five minutes! How long ago did they arrive?
I don't know... Five minutes.
I don't know... Five minutes.
Good! Snipers can't be in position.
How shall we get out now, Leon?
Let me work. We'll get out, I tell you!
No! I don't want to leave you!!
Mathilda, listen!
Mathilda, listen!
No, no! I don't want to go! I don't want!
You say it just to calm me!
Not at all, Mathilda! I tell you because it's true! You'll buy the globe you told me about and you will choose, OK? We'll go where you want! I swear, you'll see, Mathilda!!
Yes?
Good morning, Mister... It's Danielle!
Good morning, Mister... It's Danielle!
Huh! You made an error, baby. I don't know any Danielle.
Huh! You made an error, baby. I don't know any Danielle.
...I got lost, Mister.
...I got lost, Mister.
Huh? Move back, baby, I can't see anything.
Huh? Move back, baby, I can't see anything.
It's not me, it's dark here... and I can't find the switch.
...Yes?
Excuse me, Mister... I'm looking for Mister Rubens' apartment, but it's dark out here and I got lost...
Excuse me, Mister... I'm looking for Mister Rubens' apartment, but it's dark out here and I got lost...
...One second.
Don't fear.
I have no fear.
How are you, Miss?
Fine...
I'm sick with practicing, that's it...
I see. You're good, because I didn't hear anything.
I see. You're good, because I didn't hear anything.
Yeah. I put a rag on the strings, to lessen noise.
Yeah. I put a rag on the strings, to lessen noise.
Huh? That's smart!
Huh? That's smart!
I'm used to it. Not everyone likes music.
I'm used to it. Not everyone likes music.
Yeah, true. But what does your father exactly do for living?
Yeah, true. But what does your father exactly do for living?
...Composer.
...Composer.
Huh, that's good!
Huh, that's good!
Yeah, but he's not exactly my father...
Yeah, but he's not exactly my father...
Huh?
Huh?
...No... he's my lover...
You can't sit here like that.
Huh? Why?
Huh? Why?
Because you have to pay. It's like a parking meter: if you stay, you pay. It's the rule...
Because you have to pay. It's like a parking meter: if you stay, you pay. It's the rule...
...And how much is it?
...And how much is it?
Ten dollars... A month.
...OK... Good.
Can I sit on the stairways now?
Can I sit on the stairways now?
Huh... Yeah, yeah... Of course.
Rinaldi... Rinaldi... What region do you come from?
Messina.
Messina.
Emilio? Due grappe! ...Why the hell did you come here?
But... He works for your same employer?
Yeah, but I don't give a shit about. I trade at left, at right and that's dangerous in there...
Yeah, but I don't give a shit about. I trade at left, at right and that's dangerous in there...
It's a little out of the world coming to visit me this way, on mid afternoon. It really isn't the usual procedure...
It's a little out of the world coming to visit me this way, on mid afternoon. It really isn't the usual procedure...
I know... But I'm a little pressed.
...Who sent you?
Giancarlo... Rinaldi.
Is he still alive?
Yeah... And still in Messina. He's my uncle.
Yeah... And still in Messina. He's my uncle.
Huh? Are you Alfredo's son, then?
Huh? Are you Alfredo's son, then?
No... Dino's.
Have you ever been in Messina, son?
Yes... Twice.
Yes... Twice.
Did you fish in Messina? The "pesce spada"?
Did you fish in Messina? The "pesce spada"?
No...
No...
It's a specialty down there. It's a fishing boat with, in front, a long pole near the surface. Then, near the cabin, a very tall mast with a little cabin for the lookout.
I think I will get back in Messina this summer... It's too long I haven't been there.
You're right, son. You must care the links with your family, always. It's the only important thing in the world.
You're right, son. You must care the links with your family, always. It's the only important thing in the world.
...Yeah.
Salute.
Salute.
You'd better talk good, son, because, for the moment, I've got a quite bad opinion about you. Norman smiles.
I respect your business, Mister Tony. Every time we asked your help, we were very happy with the result. It's right this that makes me nervous, now. I hope you'll excuse my temporary bad mood?

Then...
Do you recognize him?
...Even his mother wouldn't.
Listen, son, you know as well as me this kind of hitmen: they come from nowhere, get the contract and disappear. They're lonely, worse than wolves.
May we have this wolf's name and address?
May we have this wolf's name and address?
These guys have no place. They change virtually everyday. And his name... It's a surname.
He probably just went somewhere.
Where?
Where?
For a walk. I don't know.
What is it?
Adelle... Maurice is in the paper.
This smells good.
Why am I such an authority?
Why am I such an authority?
Here comes the resume.
Here comes the resume.
I received my B.S. from the University of Pennsylvania, my P.H.D. from Bryn Mawr College. I worked three years at the Boston University School of Medicine, during which time I had articles printed in the "Journal of Educational Psychology", "American Journal of Psychology", "Psychology Review" and "Science"... So I think it's safe to say my opinion is valid.
Uncle Maurice, you're wearing sneakers?
High-top Nike Cross-Trainers with heel support and air-cushioned soles. They're nasty.
And your store? What about your new store? What about all your dreams?
I have new dreams now.
I have new dreams now.
I don't accept that.
I don't accept that.
Maybe one day -- after you've been married twenty years you'll understand.

Uncle Maurice -- I spent all our frequent flyer miles on a one way ticket here... I have a rented car outside, just listen to me. Come back with me now, and if you still want to do something like this in a year -- maybe we'll plan a car trip across the country -- Gerald and I will come along --

I have to walk -- by myself -- all the way -- every inch.

It's what she asked for... It's what I'm going to do.

She was being symbolic. What if she asked you to fly to the moon?
She was being symbolic. What if she asked you to fly to the moon?
You'd be visiting me at Nasa.
What if you don't make it?
I'll make it.
I'll make it.
If you really want to do this... plan it out. Rest up. Train for it. Build up your body. Plan every stop along the way. How much money? Time? Really do it properly. This is all so -- by the seat of your pants.

No it's not.
No it's not.
Why did you take the back roads here? They're not safe. You'd know that if you'd planned.
I've all ready gone six hundred miles... I can't do it again.
If you can't redo these six hundred miles when you're rested and ready, how are you possible going to walk another two thousand-five hundred miles in your present condition?
Nothing's going to happen.
Uncle, the way I was told, if that police car didn't happen down that road, you would be dead right now. That guy Denny, had jumped bail in another state, he's dangerous... They'll be other Dennys, if you don't plan.
Are you two planning kids?
Maybe later.
Maybe later.
You should definitely have children. They're really special.
I don't think you realize how serious this is Uncle.
How serious is it?
Then it'll have to wait until I finish.
What?
What?
I finish the walk, and then we may take all the chances we want.
Listen to me very carefully, because I don't want you to misunderstand me... The walk is over Uncle Maurice. Done. Finished. You've made it to California, it was a miracle, now let's try to save your life.
I'm completing the walk. I'm almost there.
I have to finish first.
I won't let you die.
What would you like us to do?
Put out a P.B.S.... Or whatever it's called.
Put out a P.B.S.... Or whatever it's called.
A.P.B.... He isn't breaking any law. He's a grown man... He can crawl on his hands and knees to China if that's what he wants to do.

Sergeant, I'm a psychologist and I know the difference between normal whims people have and actions that clearly display psychological problems... My uncle lost his wife and it devastated him.

We're very sorry about that. Some of our men were on the scene of the accident.

I think my uncle is suffering from a condition called Mania which is linked with depression. It is a time when an individual will act over-confident, and will act out impractical, grandiose plans. Sometimes these plans can be dangerous.

How long does this... Mania last?
How long does this... Mania last?
A couple days to a few months if untreated.
Look, I'll see if anyone has spotted him recently. If I get any information, I'll call you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Don't wait by the phone. If he's really been walking this whole time, he's out of our jurisdiction...
Mine.
Are you and your friends planning on driving soon?
Are you a preacher?
No, I just don't want anybody dying because I didn't say something when I had the chance.
This is Indiana -- nothing's going to happen to you.
You need a ride, Preacher?
A wife?... Did someone piss drunk run into your wife? Crushed her like a bug. Snapped her bones?
That's enough.
Oh the preacher's getting angry again... Tell me something. Did she die instantly or did she feel every torn muscle and shattered bone? Were you there to help her? Or were you safe at home when the windshield sliced into her face --
I'll kill you!
The normal amount of build up in your arteries has been aggravated by over exertion. This is called, "Claudication," As a result, there isn't enough circulation to your body. That accounts for the discoloration in your extremities and the muscle spasms I'm sure you've encountered.
Can it kill me?
Can it kill me?
It can, but it'll have to wait in line.
What steps do we take now?
We operate. We find the artery in the brain and close the bleeding... I just did this procedure on a Senator and he's doing fine.

What are the odds? Do I have a fifty-fifty chance of surviving the operation?
What are the odds? Do I have a fifty-fifty chance of surviving the operation?
It's hard to say. It's a delicate surgery. There's no getting around the fact that it's a very high-risk situation.
So what's the deal Maurice?
Pardon?
Pardon?
I mean why the sudden voluntary visit -- usually it takes gun- point to get you in here...
I mean why the sudden voluntary visit -- usually it takes gun- point to get you in here...
Routine, I assure you. I just wanted to gage my health. Am I healthy?
Routine, I assure you. I just wanted to gage my health. Am I healthy?
Yes -- you are.
Yes -- you are.
I'm going to ask you a question that may sound peculiar.
I know what you're getting at.
You do?
You do?
I've seen it before.
I've seen it before.
You have?

You're feeling old and you want to start exercising. A lot of men your age feel the need to recapture their youth. Don't feel embarrassed about it.

Okay.
Okay.
You should start slow and easy -- fifteen minutes a day.

No. How far in one attempt -- what's the farthest someone like myself could walk?
Just for curiosity sake that's all?
I don't know -- maybe twenty miles... Of course I'm not recommending that... if someone like you had to I mean... that's how far they'd probably get before encountering serious physical walls.
I don't know -- maybe twenty miles... Of course I'm not recommending that... if someone like you had to I mean... that's how far they'd probably get before encountering serious physical walls.
Twenty miles? I see.
Yes?
The flowers... they're beautiful.
You thought I sent them?
There was no card.
Have I forgotten something? Is this a special day?
It's just a regular day.
It's a special day isn't it?
Well, I'm sure it's not Christmas, because you'd be worried about how much money we don't have to spend on each other... I know it's not New Years, because you'd be going on and on about wearing a tuxedo and how much you don't like to dance... and I'm sure it's not our anniversary, because I didn't find an envelope with a hundred dollars
Ellen?
What?
What?
The new store?
The new store?
Honey, I told you. If it makes you happy, we should just do it.
Honey, I told you. If it makes you happy, we should just do it.
It's a tremendous amount of work -- moving.

... Love is shown through actions not just words.
What's that? That's not a fortune... You will be rich... That's a fortune. What you have is a statement.
What's that? That's not a fortune... You will be rich... That's a fortune. What you have is a statement.
What it is -- is the truth.
What it is -- is the truth.
I don't follow.
Is this going to be similar to the flower incident?
Sometimes people need to see things done for them -- because sooner or later they don't believe the words anymore.
Sometimes people need to see things done for them -- because sooner or later they don't believe the words anymore.
You don't think I love you?
I want to be shown... Maurice would you do anything for me?
Yes.
Yes.
Anything?
Anything?
What do you want from me? Would I swim across an ocean for you?... Would I walk across the United States for you? Yes... Yes I would. You know that.
What do you want from me? Would I swim across an ocean for you?... Would I walk across the United States for you? Yes... Yes I would. You know that.
No I don't. I don't even know if you'd walk across the street for me.
Why do you polish that thing all the time?
You're talking to me?
You're talking to me?
Why do you polish it?
A Book Society Award is a very prestigious thing.
Why are you polishing it -- in bed -- in your pajamas -- at 11:15 at night? Are you going to show it to someone?
Why are you polishing it -- in bed -- in your pajamas -- at 11:15 at night? Are you going to show it to someone?
No.
No.
Then why?
Then why?
There's no reason.
There's no reason.
Exactly. No reason. No occasion. It just makes you feel good to do something for it, to express your pride and affection for it some how... How come you'd do that for a piece of metal and not for me?
I do love you... very, very much.
Show me.
Show me.
I will -- I promise.
Walk with me?
You like to take walks?
You like to take walks?
No. But I want to take a walk with you.
It's one of those thoughts you keep to yourself.
Please tell me.
I thought we both wanted the same things.
I've changed my mind.
I've changed my mind.
You can't change your mind.
I want children.
You've just decided, is that right?
You've just decided, is that right?
Yes.
Ellen, there are two kinds of people in the world --
Please not, 'The two kinds of people' speech.
Please not, 'The two kinds of people' speech.
... People that were made to be parents, and people who were not made to be parents... My parents, were people who were not made to be parents but had kids anyway. I don't want us to be that way Ellen.
... People that were made to be parents, and people who were not made to be parents... My parents, were people who were not made to be parents but had kids anyway. I don't want us to be that way Ellen.
You can change.

Face it Ellen, I'm not the type of person who reads bedtime stories. But you love me anyway.
Face it Ellen, I'm not the type of person who reads bedtime stories. But you love me anyway.
Don't be so sure.
It must've hit the window... I think its neck is broken.
Don't bring it in here -- it probably has all kinds of diseases.
It isn't going to make it Ellen. Let the poor thing go quietly.
It'll make it.
Your father?
He's plastered.
He's plastered.
That's okay -- really it is.
That's okay -- really it is.
No it's not. He should be here with me now, not trying to find some fucking bottle of Johnny Walker. He's never been there for me. I've always been alone.
I don't know.
I think it's a different place for each person.
I think it's a different place for each person.
Did you have a dream?
I know where my heaven is.
Where?
Where?
Pacifica, California.
Why there?
When I was ten, my family lived in Pacifica for a year. I used to go to the beach everyday that summer. I never felt so happy, carefree. It was a magic place for me... That's where my heaven will be.
Maurice?
Yes.
Yes.
If I die, you'll know where to look for me?
If I die, you'll know where to look for me?
Go to sleep Ellen.
Go to sleep Ellen.
No really, if God takes us away from each other, you know where to look now?
The beach of Pacifica, California.
Good.
What did they ask?
If I had seen you. By the way I'm sorry about your wife. They told me.
If I had seen you. By the way I'm sorry about your wife. They told me.
Thank you... I'm sorry you had to lie. It must have been difficult.
Thank you... I'm sorry you had to lie. It must have been difficult.

To where?

Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

I see.
Why?
Do you believe a person's soul lives on after their death?

Most certainly.

And that that soul takes part of the person they were on this earth with them.

I don't want my wife's soul having any doubts.
I don't want my wife's soul having any doubts.
Doubts? About what?
Doubts? About what?
About my love for her.
You don't have to prove anything to her.
I'm not proving to her. I'm showing her. And I know I don't have to. I want to. I've realized, love is about giving. I'm alive, I can still give to her. I want to give her everything I can.
What's his story?
His name is Maurice. He's dancing around everything else.

If he's in trouble with the law -- fine. Not our problem. He yanked two people from a car wreck, let's give him some space.

A marriage certificate? Who the hell carries their marriage certificate around?
Maurice and Ellen Parker... it was issued in Philly... Mr. Maurice Parker has come a long way from home. Why?
Hansen's whipped. Has to call his wife every two hours or she'll go ballistic when he gets home.
P-A-R-K-E-R. Right. Get on the horn with Philly. Call me here.
I'm going to drop off Tandy at the station and then drop you back.
That's all right isn't it?
Shit! He jumped!
Jumped where?
Jumped where?
Out of the car. He jumped out of the god damn car!
Well, hello.
I'm Isaac... I'm three.
I'm Isaac... I'm three.
I'm Maurice Parker... I'm much older than three. Are your parents home?
You know what, I can play baseball with my brothers when I'm bigger.
Is that right?
Is that right?
You know what... I'm just little now, but I'll be big soon.
You know what... I'm just little now, but I'll be big soon.
You'll probably be bigger than your brothers.
You'll probably be bigger than your brothers.
Yeah!
I thought you were asleep.
You know what... I remembered you were here and I woke up.
Your parents would want you to be in bed.
You tell stories?
You tell stories?
Oh no... I'm not good at that. Very bad in fact...
There was a boy named Isaac who wanted to play baseball, but he was too small and no one would let him play... but he kept practicing by himself -- waiting... He went to every game and sat in the stands with his glove.
You know what... maybe I ran onto the field and hit a home run.
You know what... maybe I ran onto the field and hit a home run.
Who's telling this story?
Anyway, Big Billy needed another player so he yelled into the stands. 'Who can play baseball?' And there was a little voice that yelled out, 'Me, I can play.' Everyone turned to see a little boy standing with a glove.
That's me.
That's me.
Right. But everyone saw how small Isaac was and laughed... but not Big Billy. He stared at Isaac carefully and then told him to join the game. It came to the end of the game. It was the eleventh or twelfth inning or whatever is the last inning of a game...

Nine.
Nine.
Okay nine. Big Billy's team was losing and he was on base. That's when Isaac came up. He could barely hold the bat... Big Billy winked at Isaac... The ball was pitched -- Isaac hit the ball hard. It soared up and out over the stadium. Everyone cheered. Isaac hit a home run and won the game. After the game, Isaac asked Big Billy

You know what -- that was a really good story... Tell it again.
Each inch represents 150 miles...
Making the grand total?
Making the grand total?
Damn baby, relax. I'm getting to it. From Philadelphia following the route highlighted to Pacifica California -- you're traveling an estimated three thousand two hundred miles...
Three thousand miles?... How many times does twenty go into three thousand?
What was that?
What was that?
Perhaps there's another route?
Perhaps there's another route?
This is the route approved by triple A. Even if you followed back roads the entire way, you'd still be looking at roughly the same distance...
Don't worry baby, it shouldn't take you more than five days if you just stop to sleep and eat.
By car right?
This story is big huh?
Mammoth.
Mammoth.
The Gazette's small huh?
What are you saying? This story is too big for this paper?
Umm, no. It's just that --
Umm, no. It's just that --
God damn, you're right... You don't say much Michelle, but what you say is golden.
Michelle, breathe... that's it, what is it, talk to me.
Umm, Coalville Utah.
Umm, he's going to make it isn't he?
Maybe.

Pulitzer, here I come.
What happened?
Never have children. If they're not a burden to you, they're a burden to someone else.
I want to reach people. Nobody listens to me. This is my way to reach them.
To reach people, you have to feel something first... You write about the wrong things. How can you feel for dog food? The people at the Gazette don't respect it, and neither do you.

Write from your heart. That's why the classics are great.
Are you firing me?
No. No... I won't be here for a while. The store will be closed in the interim.
You going on a trip Mr. Parker?
Yes.
Yes.
Where?
Where?
California.
When are you leaving?
Tomorrow.
I'm walking there Kris.
Walking where?
Walking where?
California.
The hairs on my arm are standing up... Something strange is happening.
I always knew you had good instincts... Goodbye Kris. I'll see you when I get back.
Phileas Fogg?
... Round The World In Eighty Days. ... Hello Kris.
... Round The World In Eighty Days. ... Hello Kris.
You're amazing... What are you doing Mr. Parker?
You're amazing... What are you doing Mr. Parker?
I told you.
You're walking to California?
Pacifica, California -- it's a coastal city.
Pacifica, California -- it's a coastal city.
Oh, a coastal city. That's good.
Ellen told me that she didn't know if I loved her.
She knew you loved her.
She knew you loved her.
She wasn't certain... I never really showed her.
I'm really lost. What does this have to do with walking?
I said, 'I would do anything for her'... and she didn't believe me. I said, 'I'd walk across the country for her'... she didn't believe me.
I need to show her how much I love her Kris.
Why know?
Why know?
Because I should have shown her before... Everyday, I should have shown her.
Pacifica, California... that's a long ways away.
So I've been informed.
Ellen got up every morning and went to the corner store to get me my bread for breakfast... Everyday. Now that's about a quarter mile each way... 17 years... that comes to about three thousand miles... And you know what Kris?
What Mr. Parker?
What Mr. Parker?
She never ate a slice.
Tom Joad?
... The Grapes of Wrath.

You're amazing.
I missed you Kris.
I missed you to Mr. Parker.

You were right. From the heart is always better.
I haven't been too punctual with the rent.
I was thinking you could open another store with investors. I'm sure a lot of people would want to get involved with you now.
Are they standing?
Saluting.
Come on Mr. Parker.
What, come on?
What, come on?
I can't do it. I want you to finish, but I want you to live more.
We do the operation after I finish. I can't risk not finishing... I thought you understood what I was doing.
I do.
I do.
Why in God's name did you fly all the way here then?
Why in God's name did you fly all the way here then?
Don't do this.
Don't do this.
... To look me in the eye and say what's important to you isn't as important to me? To tell me you know what's best? To tell me life is more precious than what I feel for my wife?
Mr. Parker, you can yell at me, if it'll help. But I'm not risking your life.
It's mine to risk.
She knows you love her Mr. Parker. She knows now.
No more words. Until I touch the ocean with my hands... it's all just words.
There are a lot of people worried about you.
Where am I?
Where am I?
In a hospital.
In a hospital.
Which hospital? Did you take me back?
What do your friends call you?
Steph.
Steph.
Do you have a car, Steph?
You're in pain.
I need your help.
I need your help.
They told me, you might try to talk me into something... You need to rest Mr. Parker... It's for your own good. I've been following your story for a long while. It's a beautiful thing you did.

Mr. Parker, I'm supposed to give you your fish sticks.
... My father.
Did you tell him everything you wanted to? Did you do everything you could while he was here?
You're going to have a lot of work to do when I get back.
Someone should be with you.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Is it a boy or a girl?
Oh, that's not mine.
I don't have kids.
You should. Children are a blessing from God. I have four.
You look so happy -- how long have you been married?
Forty-seven years.
Where did he go?
He's getting my sweater from the car. I said there was a breeze. I told him not to go.
May I ask you a question that might sound strange?
Yes.
Hello, Mr. Parker.
Hello.
Hello.
How are you feeling?
How are you feeling?
Confused. I'm not sure what to do now. I'm not sure what he wants for me.

I mean you've done a great thing. You should be rewarded monetarily.

We did a piece after your story ran in the New York Times.
I've always wanted a watch like that.
It's yours.
It's yours.
No. I won't take it unless I pay for it... Let's see, that's a pretty nice watch -- I can see that.
I really want that watch.
This isn't right.
This isn't right.
This is my only chance to get a watch like that. It would mean a lot to me and my family. Please take it. It really isn't that much.
There's a one-drink minimum per show, I hope you saw the sign when you came in. Anyway, they're supposed to tell you.

Hello!
Hello.
Hello.
Are you working?
Are you working?
Working? What do you mean, working? I'm walking.
Isn't it illegal to drink and drive?
That's funny. I wonder if you'll take two hundred and fifty dollars to fuck me?
That is, if you'll come to my room for an hour, I will give you five hundred dollars.
Maybe you shouldn't stand in the road like that. You're pretty drunk.
You're pretty drunk.
Not really. My room's not far. The Whole Year Inn. You can drive with me if you want...
Sarah -- with an H?
No -- S.E.R.A.
I'm sort of curious... if you're willing to pay me two-fifty... not that I mind... I mean, I'm OK with that -- why aren't you staying in a hotel?
We can go to one if you'd prefer.
We can go to one if you'd prefer.
No, this is fine. I was just wondering.
Umm. We can stay in the car for an hour if you want. But I really have to go then. It's your time.
Right, I'll get your door. I tend to fade in and out lately.
Right, I'll get your door. I tend to fade in and out lately.
I guess I do too.

You what?

I sometimes fade out.

Oh... well, maybe we better synchronize our spells... or stagger them.

Mind if I use the bathroom?
Of course.
Want a drink? I'm having one.
A shot of tequila, if you can spare it.
A shot of tequila, if you can spare it.
Of course.
Do you want to fuck now?
Maybe another drink first. More tequila?
Maybe another drink first. More tequila?
OK... whatever.
What's the story? Are you too drunk to come?
I don't care about that. There's time left. You can have more money. You can drink all you want. You can talk or listen. Just stay, that's all I want.
No, I came here to drink... myself... you know...
To death?
To death?
Yes, that's right.
I cashed in all of my money, paid my AmEx card, gonna sell the car tomorrow.
How long's it gonna take, for you to drink yourself to death?
How long's it gonna take, for you to drink yourself to death?
I think about four weeks, and I've got enough for about two hundred and fifty to three hundred dollars a day.
I think about four weeks, and I've got enough for about two hundred and fifty to three hundred dollars a day.
Yes... that should do it. What am I? A luxury?
Yes... that should do it. What am I? A luxury?
Yeah. And your meter just ran out.
If I was I'm sorry.
No, just drunk... but that's OK. Where's your car?
No, just drunk... but that's OK. Where's your car?
I sold it this morning. I'm going to take cabs from now on in.
Don't run away.
Why should I? I know you're not a cop, so what is it tonight? Another two-fifty to watch you sleep?
What's up?
I was looking for you tonight. I don't know if you have a boyfriend...
...or a girlfriend, but if you have some free time... maybe we could have dinner.
Are you serious.
Are you serious.
I think you know I'm serious. I'll pay you if you like... but I'd like to see you.
I think you know I'm serious. I'll pay you if you like... but I'd like to see you.
No, I can't have dinner with you.
Yes.
I have to change and take a shower first. If you want to come home and wait.
We should pick up a bottle of tequila on the way. I owe you one.
You do?
This is the home of an angel.
You OK out there?
You OK out there?
Yes. Take your time. I'm fine.
You OK?
Of course. Wow... you look extremely beautiful.
Of course. Wow... you look extremely beautiful.
Thank you. What time is it?
Thank you. What time is it?
Don't know. My watch went the way of the car.
I'm rambling. I really like you. You make me want to talk... I don't know what time it is.
I like hearing you talk. If you feel up to a short walk, there's a place to eat around the corner. All the food in Vegas is terrible so the place doesn't really matter. How does that sound to you?

Do they have drinks?
I'm from the East. I went to college, did an arts course. I now live in Vegas. I think of it as home. I came here deliberately to carve out a life. I was in LA before, but I'll come back to that later. The tough times are behind me now. I can deal with the bad things that happen. There will always be
Is that really what you want to ask me?
Is that really what you want to ask me?
Yes.
Yes.
Well, then I guess this is our first date... or our last. Until now, I wasn't sure it was either.
Well, then I guess this is our first date... or our last. Until now, I wasn't sure it was either.
Very clever.
First. It's our first. I'm just concerned. So... why are you killing yourself?
Interesting choice of words. I don't remember. I just know that I want to.
Interesting choice of words. I don't remember. I just know that I want to.
Want to kill yourself? Are you saying that you're drinking as a way to kill yourself?
It wasn't so important to me. I mean, he never asked me why I was a hooker, and that was impressive. I really liked him. So I decided to just play my part. I mean... it's good to help someone once in a while, it's a bonus to being alive, and that was my plan... to stay alive. I suddenly came to a decision.
What are you thinking? Are you angry with me?
What are you thinking? Are you angry with me?
Ben, why don't you stay at my place tonight? I mean... look, you're so drunk. I like you. I trust you.
Ben, why don't you stay at my place tonight? I mean... look, you're so drunk. I like you. I trust you.
That's astonishing. Sera, look...
That's astonishing. Sera, look...
I hate to think of you in that cheesy motel. I mean...
Let's face it, what the fuck are you doing in Las Vegas?
I'm going to move to a smart hotel, tomorrow if it'll make you feel better. Let's talk about tomorrow. Wanna do something?
I'm going to move to a smart hotel, tomorrow if it'll make you feel better. Let's talk about tomorrow. Wanna do something?
Sure... tonight. Then please stay at my place.
Sure... tonight. Then please stay at my place.
Sera... you know I'm not much good in the sack.
Sera... you know I'm not much good in the sack.
It's not about sex, Ben. I'll make you up a bed on the sofa. Do it for me. We can talk till late and then sleep till late. As you know, I am my own boss.
How long have I been here?
Three nights, two days. When is your rent coming up at the motel?
Three nights, two days. When is your rent coming up at the motel?
I don't know. I'll go and sort it out today. Why don't you come?... We'll find a real room for me. You can pick it out, a tower on the strip.

Don't you think you'll get a little bored living with a drunk?
Don't you think you'll get a little bored living with a drunk?
That is what I want. Why don't you go and get your stuff?
That is what I want. Why don't you go and get your stuff?
You haven't seen the worst of it. These last few days I've been very controlled. I knock things over... I throw up all the time. Now I feel really good... You're like some kind of antidote that mixes the liquor and keeps me in balance, but that won't last forever. You'll get tired of it really quickly. Believe me.
Don't you like me, Ben?
Don't be silly?
Sera... what you don't understand is...
What?
You can never... never... ask me to stop drinking. Do you understand?
I do. I really do. OK. I have to do some shopping alone. You go out for a few drinks and then pick up your things. Don't hurry and I'll be back before you to let you in.
Hi!
Why don't you go in and sit down. I have some gifts for you.
Why don't you go in and sit down. I have some gifts for you.
Right... OK...
Want a drink? Great nap. Wanna go out tonight?
Seriously, Ben... I need to keep pretty low-key around here. Maybe next time you could nap this side of the door. That was the landlord.
Seriously, Ben... I need to keep pretty low-key around here. Maybe next time you could nap this side of the door. That was the landlord.
Of course.
Ben?
Sorry.
Sera, I love that name... S.E.R.A. Before we proceed onwards, there is something I need to say. OK?
OK.
OK.
I've come this far... here I am, in your house. I want you to let me pay the rent for this month. All right?
Why?
Because... it's better for me that way. OK?
Because... it's better for me that way. OK?
Well... OK...
Sera... I hope that you understand how I feel about this. First of all, you're welcome to my money. We can buy a couple of cases of liquor and you can have the rest. But I don't think you're talking to me right now about money.
No?
No?
No. I think you're talking about you. I'll tell you right now that I'm in love with you... but, be that as it may, I'm not here to force my twisted life into your soul.
No. I think you're talking about you. I'll tell you right now that I'm in love with you... but, be that as it may, I'm not here to force my twisted life into your soul.
I know that...
I know that...
...and I'm not here to demand your attention to the point where it changes your life. We know I'm a drunk... but that seems to be all right with you. And I know that you're a hooker. I hope you understand that I'm a person who is totally at ease with this... which is not to say that I'm indifferent or that I don't

Thanks, I do understand. I was worried about how that would be... but now I'm not. And you should know that included with the rent here is a complimentary blow job.

Ah, yes... I suppose sooner or later we ought to fuck.
Ah, yes... I suppose sooner or later we ought to fuck.
Whatever that means. Open your presents.
Right... the suitcase was clinking. So what did you do with your clothes?
I threw them into the garbage, which was perhaps immoral, but I wanted to come to you clean, so to speak. I thought we could go shopping and pick up a pair of jeans and forty- five pairs of underwear and just throw them out each day.

Nice talk, Ben. Keep drinking. In between the hundred and one proof breath and the occasional drool, some interesting words fall from your mouth.
I'm going to fill it right now.
Do you want to go gambling tonight? We could go out and play for a few hours.
Giving you money makes me want to come.
Then come. I'm going to change. Watch TV. I'll be half an hour.
I am planning to go out and do some work.
When?
When?
Tomorrow night as a matter of fact.
I like women who wear mismatched earrings.
Well, then... I hope we don't run into any tonight.
Well, then... I hope we don't run into any tonight.
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
I expect some kind of loyalty here. Just because I fuck for money doesn't give you cause to start picking up women and leaving me looking silly.
How are you doing?
Very well... umm... I never expected to have to ask you this again... but how did our evening go? I remember getting to the casino... I remember kissing you... that was really nice but everything after that is a blank.

Well -- I was prepared for worse, but it wasn't so bad. We were sitting at the bar, talking about blackjack. You seemed just fine, a little drunker than usual, but nothing really strange, but then your head started to droop and I put my arm on your shoulder and then, wham, you swung you arm at me, and fell backwards off your stool

Oh, and what did you do?
Oh, and what did you do?
I tried to shut you up and help you to your feet but you kept swinging at me -- not like you wanted to hit me, but more just waving me away. Security came and when you saw them you stopped yelling. They wanted to carry you out and dump you on the street, but I talked them into letting me walk you out.

That's impressive. How did you do that?
That's impressive. How did you do that?
I told them you were an alcoholic and I would take you home. I also promised that we would never come in there again.
I told them you were an alcoholic and I would take you home. I also promised that we would never come in there again.
We?
You were OK for a while, so we walked for about a block and then you said you wanted to go home and fuck, but I think even you knew that wasn't going to happen. We got a cab and you asked him to stop at a liquor store, even though I told you that we had plenty at home. In the store you
I warned you... ...but I'm sorry.
I warned you... ...but I'm sorry.
Here's my speech... ...I know this shouldn't be acceptable to me, but it is. Don't ask me why. I sense that your trouble is very big... and I'm scared for you... and so I'm doing what I think you need me to do. Falling down in casinos is little stuff. It doesn't bother me. It has nothing to do with us.

That's amazing. What are you? Some sort of angel visiting me from one of my drunk fantasies? How can you be so good?
Why don't you go back to sleep. I'll go out and buy us some breakfast.
Be careful.
Very creative. Now we can get you a black bow tie and you can look like one of those casino dealers.
OK, but remember that they wear it because they have to. I wear it because I want to. That'll make me look different. Let's get a drink.
Your color.
I think you should wear one at a time. One of these... and one of your others. In fact, I was going to buy just one, but I didn't think it would fly... as a gift, I mean.
What was that all about?
Can we just forget it?
Can we just forget it?
I don't understand any of that.
I don't understand any of that.
Can we just ignore it?
Please!
Yes... I'll give you that.
Yes... I'll give you that.
Thank you, Sera.
Thank you, Sera.
Do you want me not to go tonight?
Do you want me not to go tonight?
No... we already talked about that.
Maybe I should follow you around and ask one of your tricks what it's like to sleep with you.
They wouldn't know.
I'll be back home around three. If you're back by then we can watch TV or something... I guess what I'm saying is... that I hope you are back when I get home. Please be careful.
You be careful to. I'm going to miss you.
You be careful to. I'm going to miss you.
Shall we go away for a couple of days?
Shall we go away for a couple of days?
Yeah... I'd like that.
Years ago, in LA, I turned a trick on Sunset and Western. The guy was polite and didn't argue about the price. He parked his car and I took him to a house that I had an arrangement with. A fat Mexican woman was watching a TV and I told him to give her the twenty for the room. There were three or four
Last spring I happened to walk past a house that I had once patronized. There was a cool breeze blowing off the ocean and through the window I could see a bare leg. The girl must have been taking a break between customers. It was a strange moment for me because it reminded me of my mother and despite the fact that I was

Yes. One of my friends was there. I wonder if you ever clipped her.
I like it here with you.
Let's stay for a while.
Let's stay for a while.
OK.
I've missed the best sun. Why did you have to pawn your watch?
I didn't know I'd ever need it again.
Maybe it's time I moved to a hotel.
And do what... rot away in a room? We're not going to talk about that. Fuck you! I will not talk about that. You're staying here. You are not moving to a hotel.
And do what... rot away in a room? We're not going to talk about that. Fuck you! I will not talk about that. You're staying here. You are not moving to a hotel.
Will you lighten up, please?
Will you lighten up, please?
One thing... one thing... this is one thing you can do for me. I've given you gallons of free will here! You can do this for me.
There are limits.
Yes... I guess I knew that.
I wanted to see you...
Oh, Ben... you look so very sick... my love... you're so pale.
You know I love you... yeah?
Yes.
Hey, Brad... how's it going?
Hey Ben. There were a couple of guys looking for you.
Hey Ben. There were a couple of guys looking for you.
What did they look like?
What did they look like?
Suits. I didn't tell them anything. You know anything about gears?
How'd this happen?
I was going real fast down on the beach and something slipped and everything got jammed up.

I don't know. I'll find out though.
About ready for another drink?
Yes, that would be great. Are you her for the convention?
Yes, that would be great. Are you her for the convention?
Do I look that obvious? My name's Paul.
So... are you alone, or are you just using me to make someone else jealous?
Alone. Alone. I'm here alone.
Alone. Alone. I'm here alone.
Where are you staying?
Where are you staying?
Right here at the hotel. Why?
Right here at the hotel. Why?
Well... I thought you might be looking for a date.
Well... I thought you might be looking for a date.
A date. What, are you a hooker? What do you mean a date? I've got a wife back home. I just came over to talk for a few minutes.
A date. What, are you a hooker? What do you mean a date? I've got a wife back home. I just came over to talk for a few minutes.
I'm sorry, I guess I misunderstood.
Please don't raise your voice. I won't bother you about it again.
Sorry. Look... you seem like a nice girl. I'm just sick of everyone in this town trying to get my money.
I don't want this. Yuri, please. I really don't want this. You know I don't like to do groups.
I want this, Sera. I need this!
I want this, Sera. I need this!
Please, Yuri.
You have been lonely?
I've been all right.
I've been all right.
I will keep you safe. We are both older.
You have been lonely?
I am lonely, Yuri.
I'm pleased with you, Sera... how you have moved up in the world. I showed you a glamorous world when I took you off the streets... and how you repay me.
Where have you been staying?
Where have you been staying?
With an old friend.
It is, after all, Sera, my money.
Yes, of course. How much do you need?
Yes, of course. How much do you need?
All of it. I need to buy many things... all of it!
Where have you been?
It was a slow night. I went to a hotel for a few drinks.
A full night on the street and this is all?
Like I said... it was a slow night... I'm sorry. It was hard to score.
Don't hit me.
What do you think... you are sixteen years old on Hollywood Boulevard?
Yes? What?
It's me, Yuri.
Have you told anyone that I'm here?
No.
Go, Sera. Go. Stay at home. I will call you tomorrow.
Yuri... are you...
Yuri... are you...
Sera... please go.

That's right.
That's right.
But it's a top three school --

I have a 4.0.

Yes, but your major is Fashion Merchandising. Harvard won't be impressed that you aced "History of Lycra". What are your backups?
I don't need backups. Harvard is the school I'm going to.
Well, then. You'll need excellent recommendations from your professors, a heck of an admissions essay and at least a one-seventy-five on your LSATs.
I once had to judge a Theta Chi Tighty- Whitey contest. Trust me -- I can handle anything.
What alibi?
I can't tell you.
I can't tell you.
You understand you're on trial for murder?
You understand you're on trial for murder?
I didn't do it! I walked in, saw my husband lying on the floor, bent down to check his heart, screamed my head off and Chutney and Enrique ran inside.
I didn't do it! I walked in, saw my husband lying on the floor, bent down to check his heart, screamed my head off and Chutney and Enrique ran inside.
Where they saw you standing over the body covered in his blood.
Why would I kill my husband?
Insurance? A love affair? Pure unadulterated hatred? Believe me, the DA will come up with plenty of reasons.
Insurance? A love affair? Pure unadulterated hatred? Believe me, the DA will come up with plenty of reasons.
I loved him!
I loved him!
He was thirty-four years older than you. That doesn't sound so good to a jury.
Brooke, I believe you. But a jury is gonna want an alibi.
I can't give you that. And if you put me on the stand, I'll lie.
Were you with another man?
Go to hell.
Go to hell.
I'll take that as a no.
I'll take that as a no.
Are we done for today?
Are we done for today?
I believe we are.
What're you so happy about? You're on trial for murder.
Get up.
Get up.
What?
What?
You're fired. I have new representation.

Who?
Is he always such an ass?
He's the top defense attorney in the state. Of course he's an ass.

He thinks I'm guilty, doesn't he?

That's not what's important.
That's not what's important.
To me it is. He doesn't trust me. Why should I trust him?
I'm a Delta Gamma and I'm a huge fan of yours!
You took my class in LA. You had the best high kick I've ever seen. Are you one of my lawyers?
You took my class in LA. You had the best high kick I've ever seen. Are you one of my lawyers?
Sort of.
Are you okay? You look so sad... and so orange.
I'm glad it's you and not Donovan.
I'm glad it's you and not Donovan.
He means well. He's really brilliant and all.
Elle, I can't. You don't understand.
Who could better understand than me?
It's so shameful...
Whatever it is -- it could save you.
Whatever it is -- it could save you.
That's just it -- it would ruin me!
That's just it -- it would ruin me!
How?
I have made my fortune on my ability to teach women how to perfect their bodies with the Brooke's Butt Buster workout.
I know! You helped me go from a six to a four!
No!
I'm a fraud! But it's not like normal people can have this ass! If my fans knew, I'd lose everything. I've already lost my husband. I rather be in jail then lose my reputation!
I'm not having an affair with Enrique -- you know a Delta Gamma would never sleep with a man who wears a thong! I just liked watching him bend over to clean the filter --
I believe you! Don't worry.
What's going on?
Enrique's gay. I'm sure of it.
Enrique's gay. I'm sure of it.
He did leave a Cher tape in the pool house once --
I got out of the shower, walked downstairs, saw her standing over my father, and called the police.
Did she have a weapon in her hand?
Did she have a weapon in her hand?
No.
No.
Was there any reason for you to believe she had discarded a weapon?
Was there any reason for you to believe she had discarded a weapon?
Uh, yeah, because the bitch shot him.
Uh, yeah, because the bitch shot him.
Was there any evidence that Mrs. Windham shot him?
Was there any evidence that Mrs. Windham shot him?
His dead body with a bullet in it.
Okay -- Ms. Windham, when you uh arrived back at the house? Was your father there?
Not that I saw. But like I said, I went straight upstairs to take a shower.
Not that I saw. But like I said, I went straight upstairs to take a shower.
And when you came downstairs, what happened?
And when you came downstairs, what happened?
I saw Brooke standing over his body, drenched in his blood.

But Mrs. Windham didn't have a gun?
But Mrs. Windham didn't have a gun?
No, she'd stashed it by then.
Did you hear a shot fired?
No. I was in the shower.
No. I was in the shower.
So at some point in the -- twenty minutes you were in the shower, your father was shot?
So at some point in the -- twenty minutes you were in the shower, your father was shot?
I guess.
But you didn't hear the shot, because you were in the shower.
Yes. I was washing my hair.
Miss Windham, can you tell us what you'd been doing earlier in the day?
I got up, went to Starbucks, went to the gym, got a perm, and came home.
I got up, went to Starbucks, went to the gym, got a perm, and came home.
Where you got in the shower.
Where you got in the shower.
Yes.
Yes, Your Honor. Had you ever gotten a perm before, Miss Windham?
Yes.
How many, would you say?
Two a year since I was twelve. You do the math.
Two a year since I was twelve. You do the math.
You know, a girl in my sorority, Tracy Marcinko, got a perm once. Even though we all told her not to. Curls really weren't the right look for her -- She didn't have your bone structure.
Chutney, why is it that Tracy Marcinko's curls were ruined when she got hosed down?
Because they got wet.
Because they got wet.
That's right. Because isn't the first cardinal rule of perm maintenance that you are forbidden to wet your hair for at least twenty-four hours after getting a perm at the risk of de-activating the ammonium thiglycolate?
And if you in fact, heard the gunshot, then Brooke Windham wouldn't have had time to hide the gun before you got downstairs. Which would mean that you would've had to have found Mrs. Windham with a gun in her hand to make your story sound plausible. Isn't that right?
She's younger than I am. Did she tell you that? How would you feel if your father married someone younger than you?
She's younger than I am. Did she tell you that? How would you feel if your father married someone younger than you?
You, however, had time to hide the gun, didn't you, Chutney? After you shot your father?
Dewey Newcomb?

Huh?
Huh?
Tell him, Paulette.
All I know is -- it's not Brooke.
That's touching, Elle, but we need an alibi.
Did you get it?
Yes. But I can't tell you what it is.
Why the hell not?
I promised her I'd keep it secret. I can't break the bonds of sisterhood!
What are you talking about?
He's gay -- he isn't Brooke's lover! He's making it up. Whoever killed Heyworth is paying him off.
Good work today, Ms. Woods.
Thank you!
Sit down.
Is everything okay?
Is everything okay?
You followed your intuition today and you were right on target. I should've listened.
You followed your intuition today and you were right on target. I should've listened.
Thank you.
Thank you.
About the alibi --
I'm sorry, but --
I'm impressed that you took the initiative to go there and get it. That's what makes a good lawyer. And on top of that, you gained the client's trust and kept it. That's what makes a great lawyer. You're smart, Elle. Smarter than most of the guys I have on my payroll.
I think it's time discuss your career path. Have you thought about where you might be a summer associate?
Not really. I know how competitive it all is --
You're hitting on me?
You're a beautiful girl, Elle.
You're a beautiful girl, Elle.
So everything you just said --
So everything you just said --
I'm a man who knows what I want.
You're not going up there.
Yes, I am.
I do. I'm not allowing it.
But you agreed last night. In the office? When we were discussing my "career"?
What did you see when you entered the house?
I saw Mrs. Windham standing over the body of Mr. Windham.
I saw Mrs. Windham standing over the body of Mr. Windham.
Was she carrying a weapon?
Was she carrying a weapon?
No, she was crying her eyes out.
So she was distraught that her husband was dead?
Oh, yes. Mrs. Windham is the most sweet, wonderful woman I know. I have loved her since the day she hired me. She could never do something this awful. I know this because we are very close.
Mr. Salvatore, do you have any proof that you and Mrs. Windham were having an affair?
Just the love in my heart.

Donovan's firm is defending a major murder case and his caseload is so heavy he's taking on first year interns.

We spend a beautiful night together and then I never hear from you again?

I think so...

How about --

I don't know.
I don't know.
Well, I recommend knowing before speaking. The law leaves much room for interpretation -- but very little for self-doubt.
You can't even imagine.
Spill.
After you went to all that trouble?
Well, what am I supposed to do? He's engaged! She's got the family six- carat on her bony, unpolished finger.

What'd you do?
What'd you do?
Cried a lot and gained twenty pounds. Dewey kept the trailer and my precious baby Rufus. I got jackcrap.
I didn't even get to go to his birthday party.
No!
No!
What could I do? He's a man who followed his pecker to greener pastures. I'm a middle- aged high-school dropout with stretch marks and a fat ass. Happens every day. At least to women like me.

She's from Connecticut. She belongs to his stupid country club.
She's from Connecticut. She belongs to his stupid country club.
Is she as pretty as you?
Is she?
She could use some mascara and some serious highlights, but she's not completely unfortunate-looking.
Could I be anymore goddamn spastic? So you're sure, this Warner guy is "the one"?
Definitely! I love him!
You showed up Warner in class? You're supposed to be showing up Sarah.
I couldn't help it! It was the most fun I've had since I've been in law school. Not only was I good enough for Warner -- I was better than him. He has to see serious I am now. Even Donovan was impressed, and he's a total hard-ass.
You ready?
No.
No.
Yes, you are. Go -- you can do this.
God, that felt great!
Look at him. He's still scratching his head.
Look at him. He's still scratching his head.
Which must be a nice vacation for his balls...
I feel so bad for her. I mean, she's in jail! And she's innocent. But I'm the only one who believes her. Donovan totally thinks she's guilty.
That's because men are big, fat retards who don't -- Oh, my God...
So, this is the only interaction you two have ever had?
No. Sometimes I say "Okay" instead of "Fine".
No. Sometimes I say "Okay" instead of "Fine".

What's the point? Look at me.
I am. And I'm looking at a beautiful, fabulous, sexy woman.
Good one.
Trust me. You've got the equipment, you just need to read the manual.
And after they set his nose, he came back for his truck and I offered to drive for him since he was still on pain-killers and we spent the whole afternoon together! He was unconscious for part of it, but it was really fun!
I'm so happy for you!
I'm so happy for you!
How'd it go at the trial?
How'd it go at the trial?
Great. Donovan actually said the words "Good work, Ms. Woods". He takes me seriously! Can you believe it?
Great. Donovan actually said the words "Good work, Ms. Woods". He takes me seriously! Can you believe it?
Of course I can believe it. You're going to make a great lawyer.
You can't go home!
What's the point of staying? All people see when they look at me is blonde hair and big boobs. No one's ever going to take me seriously. The people at law school don't, Warner doesn't -- I don't even think my parents take me seriously. They wanted me to grow up and become a Victoria's Secret model who marries a rock star. Now, for
I'm here to see Brooke Windham.

Hi. Sarah Knottingham.
You know her?
Our group is full.
Oh, God, was this like an RSVP thing?
The idiot speaks.
Although Mr. Huntington makes an excellent point, I have to wonder if the defendant kept a thorough record of each sperm emission made throughout his life?
I believe her, too. I don't think she's having an affair with Enrique.
Too bad you and I are the only ones.
Too bad you and I are the only ones.
I'm still can't believe you didn't tell Donovan the alibi.
It's not my alibi to tell --
I know. I thought that was very -- classy of you.
I know. I thought that was very -- classy of you.
Really? Thanks.
Warner can't even do his own laundry.
I know. He has it sent out.
I know. He has it sent out.
Did you know he got wait-listed when he applied? His father had to make a call.
Did you know he got wait-listed when he applied? His father had to make a call.
You're kidding!
Donovan asked to see you before you leave.
Really?
Really?
He's already got his coffee -- maybe he needs a donut.
You almost had me fooled.
What?
What?
Maybe you should sleep with the judge too. Then we can win the case.
I'm a bitch.
Yes, you are.
Yes, you are.
And Donovan's a scumbag for coming on to you.

Yes, he is.

Can someone please tell Rick that he is not the only Sigma Chi with a big penis?

Well, I don't want to look like I know what's coming...
What if -- you know -- it's not the night?
Why else would he be taking you to The Ivy? You've been dating for a year -- it's not like he's trying to impress you.
I don't know! Everything was normal at first and then he said he needed someone more -- Serious!
Serious?! Who the hell does he think he is? You're the most popular month on the USC calendar!
We still love you. Sisters forever!
Thank you. I love you, too.
Honey, stop! You have to leave this room -- it's been a week.
So?
Once Warner sees me as a serious law student, he'll want me back. It's a completely brilliant plan!
But isn't it kind of hard to get into law school?
But isn't it kind of hard to get into law school?

Oh, how sweet! You made friends with a nerdy girl.
Margot!
Speaking of which, can you please put on some party clothes? You look like someone rolled you in something sticky and dragged you through a K- Mart.
I can't believe you guys are actually here -- but this case is important. I'll make it up to you after finals, okay? I -- promise. I really want to do a good job.
Hello! You're like, a lawyer.
Not yet.
Do they just -- put you on the spot like that? Like, all the time?

Don't worry. It gets better. Who else do you have?
Donovan, Royalton and Levinson.
Speak up in Donovan's class. He likes people with an opinion. Sit in the back for Royalton. He tends to spit when he talks about products liability.
And make sure you read the footnotes in Levinson's class. That's where all her exam questions come from.
Wow. I'm glad I met you.
Good luck.
Thanks again for your help!
Don't ask.
I wasn't gonna --
Okay, if Brooke didn't kill the guy, who did?
My money's on the angry daughter or the ex-wife.
Explain to me why you're so anti- Brooke.
Uh, for starters, she won't give us an alibi --

You're kind of being a butt-head right now.
How do you figure?
How do you figure?
Because people aren't always what they seem to be and you refuse to see that. Have a little faith. You might be surprised.
I can't believe you called me a butthead. No one's called me a butt- head since ninth grade.
Maybe not to your face...
Damn. We can't see her for an hour?
No, she can't move for an hour.
Mrs. Windham Vandermark?
We're here from Austen, Platt, Jaret & Donovan --
She's not!
Did your daughter ever say anything to you about Brooke and Heyworth's relationship?
How can you still believe she's innocent?

I never trust a woman who's not blonde. Except for my friend Serena, but that's only because she's a blonde at heart. That's the whole reason I'm starting the Blonde Legal Defense Fund.
The what?
Blondes are discriminated against worldwide! Brooke's a blonde, and people are saying she's sleeping with the cheesy pool boy and shooting her husband. If she was a mousy brunette, it would be, "Oh, the poor widow."

You're serious?
Okay, how would it work?
It would be a full-service law firm, by and for blondes, providing positive blonde role models and community outreach in high blonde areas. I mean, think about it -- name one blonde intellectual role model.

Wait -- Hilary Clinton.
Wait -- Hilary Clinton.
If she were a true blonde, she would've left the cheating bastard. Blondes don't let their husbands get fellated by brunettes and live to tell about it.
In that case, maybe Heyworth got fellated by a brunette and Brooke caught him.

Gay men know designers. Straight men don't.

I'm quitting.
Whoa -- Why?
Law school was a mistake. Getting this internship was a mistake.

Going back to LA. Maybe I can fulfill my destiny as a useless bimbo and join the Swedish Bikini Team. No more navy blue suits. No more panty- hose. No more trying to be something I'm not.

No -- it's just -- not me.

Girls -- I'm going to Harvard!
What, like on va-kay?
Calvin Klein's spring line is atrocious. Don't you agree?
Absolutely!
Almost.
Well, hurry up so you can come home! We miss you!

I got bangs!

Really --
What're you doing here?!
We're on our way to the bridal show in New York so we thought we'd rescue you from law school for the night.
You guys -- I can't. We're in the middle of a trial.
Where's Warner?
I wish we could stay longer, but I have a game.
I can't believe you're a Laker Girl!
Neither.
Why not?
Why not?
I'd rather have a client who's innocent.
Yes? Ms. Woods?
I changed my mind. I'd pick the dangerous one.
I did?
You're applying for my internship, aren't you?

Maiden name -- Daniels. You know her?
She was a Delta Gamma! Not in my pledge class or anything -- she graduated five years ahead of me. But I used to take her class at the LA Sports Club. She's amazing!
Amazing how?
She could make you drop three pounds in one class. She's completely gifted!
She could make you drop three pounds in one class. She's completely gifted!
Well, in all likelihood, she's completely guilty as well. She was seen standing over her husband's dead body.
His twenty-seven year old daughter and the pool boy.
Maybe she found him like that.
Maybe she found him like that.
That's the story she'll be telling the jury. We just have to prove it.
You don't really believe she's innocent?
Of course, I do!
Class schedule, map, book list.
Has Warner Huntington checked in yet?

Uh, no. Maybe you should try the Lido deck.

You're beautiful.
So are you!
I'm fully amenable to that discussion.
I mean, we're having a lot of fun now -- but things are gonna be different when I'm at Harvard. Law school is a completely different world. I need to be serious.

Elle -- no -- your boobs are fine --
C'mon. Let me take you home.
No.
No.
Elle -- it's twenty miles back to campus.
Elle, believe me, I never expected to be doing this, but I think it's the right thing to do.
How can it be the right thing if we're not together?

You got into Harvard Law?

What, like it's that hard?
Oops! Time for class. Meet me after? On the benches?
Uh -- sure.
So -- uh -- how was your first class?
Fine. Except for this horrible girl who made me look bad in front of my Civ Pro professor. But no biggie. You're here now. How was your summer?
Good. Good.
Do anything exciting?
I'm sorry, I just hallucinated.
Sarah was my girlfriend at prep school. We got back together over the summer at my grandmother's birthday party.
Wow. You're a walking felony.
Thank you. Having fun?

Now I am.

I feel like we've barely spent any time together since we got here.

Elle, c'mon, there's no way you'll get the grades to qualify for one of those spots. You're not smart enough.

Am I on glue, or did I not get into the same law school you did, Warner?

Thank you.
If you tell him, you'll probably make summer associate. Who cares about Brooke? Think about yourself.
I gave her my word, Warner.
Pink ones.
See?
Thanks for the backup.
How was I supposed to know what kind of shoes you had on?
It made me realize something. I'm an idiot.
Really?
In court. On opposing sides.
Are you serious?
Are you serious?
Huh. Imagine that. Looks like I am.
Did you ever take Mrs. Windham on a date?
Yes.
Yes.
Where?

A restaurant in Oakland. Where no one would recognize us.

Chuck.

I'm covered in very expensive Egyptian mud -- hardly naked.
So, I hear the tart from California shot Heyworth.
Well, that's what we're trying to prove didn't happen. Do you have any reason to believe it did?

I never met the woman, but from what my daughter tells me, she's quite the cun --
Aside from the fact that he found her on an infomercial? She said they humped like gorillas. Chutney could hear them all the way in the pool house.
I' m sure that was very awkward for Chutney. Much as it is for me, hearing you tell about it.

Haven't you seen the cabana boy?
Hovering?
I didn't stick around long enough to watch him stick his swizzle stick in her mouth, but I'd bet my next check that that's where he was about to put it.
Elle?
Where's the Rock?
Is it a Kappa?
It's not a Theta --
Oh, God. What if Josh doesn't think I'm serious enough?
Helloo... you let him have anal sex with you. Helloo... you let him videotape you diddling yourself.
Helloo... you let him have anal sex with you. Helloo... you let him videotape you diddling yourself.
You're right. Phew!
What's the thing that always makes us feel better, no matter what?
Cunnilingus?
Let's all go! Road trip!
Wait -- Cecil has a condo in Tahoe. Let's go there!
Why?!
I mean, I know you're upset and all, but can't you just take a sedative?
You passed Spanish because you gave Professor Montoya a hand-job after the final.
Yeah, luckily.
There he is!
Pull up next to him!
Why so few?
Faith.
Fool's magic.
Precisely. Faith has persuaded them a pygmie with a sling can kill an armed giant.
Fight's over before it's begun... soon the survivors will be in full retreat.
Then we smash 'em?

Anything left for smashing you may happily smash.
You go? Not watch fun?
I have something far more pleasant awaiting me.
We come watch... we come watch...
Nay. This is a private affair, no audience welcome... Better you watch the dismantling of our enemies... and, look you, see the moat is set aflame.

Fire moat... why do that?

Purely a precaution...

Delusion... a kind of magic which works against the magician.
Dumb magic. Giant smash peewee.
Always.
Always.
We go out, smash 'em now?
We go out, smash 'em now?
No. Smashing is not required. I have a surprise for our tiny invaders... Raise that hatch!
Birdies... pretty...
I doubt the faeries will admire their beauty... Come, this will be fun to watch.
We watch... good fun...
Indeed, the best of fun... Enjoy yourselves.
More fun win battle?

When the time's come, you won't need to jump, I'll throw you out myself!

No. Now is the time for discipline. Some lessons in obedience for the future Baroness.
Jack... Oh, Jack... Help me...
Too bad your precious Jack can't hear you... the damsel in distress... A rescue attempt would be most amusing... We could flay sweet Jack alive as an after-dinner entertainment...
Your moans seem almost pleasurable, my dear... developing a taste for the lash?
Kill me... I want... so nice...
Kill me... I want... so nice...
Why should I kill you? A simple course in etiquette... something your parents sadly overlooked.
No more... please...
I can keep a victim alive for weeks... months, if I desire it... it's an art. They beg for death... I keep it just out of their reach. The pain remains constant.

My dear Princess, the human soul is a highly elusive commodity. I suggest you spend some hours before the glass. Contemplate your intriguing reflection and consider whether such a creature as yourself could possibly possess something as fine and beautiful as a soul.
You're a beast!
Indeed I am, my dear... that makes us a pair!
What was that? Did you hear that?
It's nothing. My men take great delight in routing the enemy. Don't trouble yourself, beauty.

Why, Jack-lad, she likes you, is all. And what hot-blooded hero wouldn't welcome the affections of a fair nymph like Oona here...? If your blood runs so cold, boy, you be a corpse before your time.
What does she want from me?
Elderberry wine. No finer drink under heaven.

Think there be truth only in beauty, lad? If you've the courage to ask and take care to avoid her terrible claws, Jenny Greenteeth has the answers you seek.

Will you lead me to her?
Will you lead me to her?
Aye. On the morrow we go, but tonight... ... tonight is for making merry.
Are we here?
Aye. That foul wallow be where Jenny Greenteeth dwells. Oona... lure her out. Play the part of a girl-child.

What do I do?
What do I do?
Don't get caught, that's what! She'll suck your bones like honey- comb.
Here now. Toss her this when you've the chance. Jenny Greenteeth can't resist the sight of herself in a glass. She's terribly vain. Praise her beauty and you'll lull her sweet as a babe in a cradle.
And if she thinks me a liar?
And if she thinks me a liar?
Fie on what she thinks! You mind her claws and teeth... Cast your spell, Oona.
The princess is dead.
Lamentable news, Jack... but tis the fate of the living concerns us now.

Twill take more than heart. Where do we find the armor of Achilles, for a start?
Twill take more than heart. Where do we find the armor of Achilles, for a start?
I know where to find it. Taking possession be another matter.
There it be, lad. The Lindfarne Mound. Kings long forgotten lie there, lost in their final sleep.
Have we turned grave-robber, then?
Have we turned grave-robber, then?
A tomb it once was, boy, and a tomb it may yet be... There's another in residence at Lindfarne now.
A tomb it once was, boy, and a tomb it may yet be... There's another in residence at Lindfarne now.
And who might that be?
And who might that be?
No less a creature than the Lindfarne Worm.
So I'm to be a dragon-slayer, is that it?
Now, Jack-lad, no one's asking ye to skewer the worm. Even St. Michael'd have a job on his hands for all that. But the serpent hoards a pile of booty, Achilles' armor among his treasures... if we find our way within the mound and him asleep...

Knaves and robbers...
Better pray the worm's a sound sleeper, Jack.
You do the praying. I've work ahead.

There's the spirit, lad. If ye run into trouble, give a yank here and we'll haul ye up.

What's left of me... How do I recognize the armor of Achilles?
What's left of me... How do I recognize the armor of Achilles?
You'll know it when you see it... tis a splendid sight, all covered with gold... Don't fear making noise. Dragons be deaf as tree stumps.
There be no finer victuals than worm flesh, lad.
Better we eat him than the other way round.
By the grace of God.
No false modesty, lad. You're a proper champion. Achilles' armor sits on you like it was forged to fit.
I believe this is a sword such as the archangels wield. Surely St. Michael had so fine a blade when he drove the serpent from heaven.
Well then, you've got the sword and you've got the armor; all's lacking is the steed.
Shhhh!
Screwball! You dolt! I've a mind to change you into a toad.
What is it?
Something's coming.
Pregnant, is she?
It would appear so.
Damn them!
Careful, lad.
Don't see why I can't ride, too! I'm second in command, damn it!

A true and troubling question, Gump... We'll start from where the unicorn was killed. The Baron must have left a trail.

Worse than the battlefield.
What know you of fields of war?
What know you of fields of war?
Ofttimes, the wee folk come out to tend the wounded... staunch bleeding with cobwebs... give a parched mouth a sip of dew... cool a fevered brow...
There... it seems to quit... I'll wager that war held other attractions quite apart from nursing.
Well... if the knight be already dead; what harm is there in... borrowing a thing or two?

Oona tells me the raven has roosted for the night on a sharp stone spire some half a mile distance.
That would be Devil's Needle. Last landmark I know in these woods.
Good.
Beyond Devil's Needle, all is unknown.
Twould appear other travelers precede us.
Nay, Jack, tis not what you're thinking.

Jack, Jack, it's dwarves live here. Hard-working chaps. Hammering in the forge all the live-long day. Make the most wondrous things, they do.
And this? Some of their handiwork?
Nay. That's but to distract the casual visitor. A dwarf is too busy to suffer fools gladly.

Your imagination runs away with you, Jack... Those bones be but battlefield gleanings, like I mentioned. A wee bit of carrion to frighten off the uninvited.

Here is a bold champion's reward; to serve as a dwarf's doorstop.
Nice piece of work.
Pure gold it is... plays a different note every time.
My God! Look!
Something the matter?
Something the matter?
Ogg's footprints!
Shhh! Not so loud, mayhap he'll hear ye.
Dwarves be very sensitive about their feet.

Certainly understandable.

Very secretive, they are. Keep their feet covered up. Best if you don't mention it.
I should hope not!
Gump, you're putting words in my mouth.
I pray always to be worthy of it.
Stoutly spoke, lad. These dwarves be sore grouches... Pay no heed to their spiteful grumbling.
Don't let this talk of heroes upset you, Jack. Sigurd's sword is no great thing. The Volsung killed Fafnir. You killed Lindfarne. That's one worm apiece... I'd say you and Sigurd were neck-and-neck.
We're not in a tournament, Gump. Ah, but a sword twice tempered in the blood of living dragons...

Your strong right arm's all the protection I'll need this night.
Make haste! We've a hard day's march ahead.
Be gentle with them, Jack. They only march to please you. Were this a faerie journey, we'd ride the wind on thistledown and ragwort stems.
... this rate... we'll all be in our graves... 'fore we reach the Baron's fortress...
We'll surely be in our graves if we don't.
We'll surely be in our graves if we don't.
Going grows slower... we've not made... half a mile in two hours...
God's blessing.
There's the way, mates.
What make ye of that, Jack?
It bodes evil.
Wait!
Willful creature, that one...
Archers! Bring down that spider! I'll deal with this other creature...
Stay on your guard, Jack. The bug is enchanted surely.
Is she... dead?
No, thank the Lord, but she be sore envenomed by the spider's bite.
No, thank the Lord, but she be sore envenomed by the spider's bite.
We're blind now. Oona was our eyes and ears. How do we find the Castle Couer de Noir without her?

Long as we don't lose heart, Jack...

We'll never find the Baron's castle.

Once you thought we'd never find the Greek's armor and look at ye now, decked out like a proper hero.
Wait, Jack.
Nay. This time we strike first!
Hold, Jack! Don't strike!
Nay. I show no pity to imps and fiends.
Nay. I show no pity to imps and fiends.
I know the rogue, Jack. Tis Jimmy Squarefoot.
Aye. We be on a quest to set the world aright --
But seem to have gotten lost on the way.
Can we trust him?
No... but what choice have we?
Never felt so cold in all me born days...
The chill is worse this night.
Don't like the feel of it, Jack.
It's your own fear troubles you... We're here, aren't we? For all the dark magic protecting it.
Give in to despair and all is lost.
It feels wrong, Jack... like a trap.

It's what we'll find there worries me.

It doesn't matter.

I don't... understand.
I don't... understand.
The alicorn, lad. Come to your senses! Unless we find Baron Couer de Noir and bring back the horn the world is doomed.
The Baron hides in the dark in a passage under the Castle... Quick, give me the dwarf's key... the one which opens any lock...
In the dark, lad? Why should he do that?
In the dark, lad? Why should he do that?
Because sunlight will kill him. Quickly now, give me the key.

I admire your valor, Jack. By all means, seek him out... But first, we needs visit the kitchen.
The kitchen be the most important room in a palace, for if the victuals ain't right, little else is likely to be so.
Did you bring me here to sup?

Easier than that, Jack. Screwball! Fetch me down a couple of them plates.
Will you explain what's going on?
Patience, lad.
Hey! Stop it! I can't see.
Ah, but you will. And so will the Baron, when we bring a little light to his dark hideaway.
Can't we move any faster?
Tis a delicate operation, lad. Requires a bit of engineering... Next!
Seems to be some sort of vaulted chamber up ahead...
Don't get too far!
Don't get too far!
Hurry up!
He's getting away! He was at my mercy!
Never show mercy!
Never show mercy!
I could have struck off his head just now!
Ever wondered why Jenny Greenteeth said you needed the fastest steed on earth?

She lives like all the world before the Baron's curse lifted. Now the world's reborn, yet still she sleeps...
The quest's at an end and where's the good of it? A faerie festival over a pile of bones?
Tis not the wound, that's sure. Not a scar remains... we're talking about a spell; harder to repair than sword-work.

Nay. Jack's the dragon-slayer, ain't you, Jack.
Well done, lad. Stout heart.
Wolf-slayer, worm-sticker... give a cheer for the champion!
Barely living, from the looks of it.
No, no, no... this is different!
You see! You see!
These chaps'll need a woodpecker to pick their teeth.
Ogg lives there...! And Thurgis!
Screwball! Be quiet...! We have friends live 'neath the Needle. They'll no doubt provide safe refuge for the night.
We seek to undo the curse.
Gonna make ogre-stew!
Well done, lad.
Three cheers for our champion.
Look at that shot! Three at once! I can't miss!
Very thrifty. Even got your arrow back.
Sweet slippers of Oisin!
They've fired the moat!
Someone like Floki... or Squarefoot... or --
You'll do it because I am you liege and I command you to do it!
Aye... my Lord...
Rise, Screwball, and into the basket with you.
Start acting like you're worthy of this mission... Here. Whatever you do, don't dare drop it.
Nay, Sire, I'll cling to it as to life itself...

How're these?
They'll do nicely.
Dolt!
Sorry.
Greetings, my lady, the green wood is honored.
Oh, Jack, you are a wild man to use me so.
These for me?
If you like.
You promised!

Oh! Green Jack! What a dream I've had... proper nightmare.

Sweet Jack. I'm so sorry you found me asleep. Don't know what came over me.
I can't have been under much more than a minute.

Heading north still?

True north... Straight up that pass, through the net.
The fastest in the world.
I know where to find him... He lies out on the marsh, raven-fodder; his horn torn from his head.
What do we do now?
We wait.
What's she doing?
I think she's about to foal.
I'm in your debt, Screwball.
Watch behind or I'll never collect on it!
Praise be to God.
Small miracles better than no miracles...
Master Jack! Master Jack! These woods are alive! They're alive!
Of course they're alive. All nature is living.
Where?
Up ahead!
Up ahead!
Come on, Gump, let's have a look at this witchcraft.
What can you steal from a man already lost his life?
His honor, I suppose... seeing he no longer can defend it.
What care the bones when the soul is free?
Bah! You faeries have the morals of ferrets.
Maybe there's a better idea... What about birds... get a lift from some friendly bird...
Haven't heard a bird sing in days...

Hello, Jack.
Done like a champion. Can you reach me with the line?
Sorry, Jack.
It's done... we'll never catch him.
Your fond wishes give me strength, dear friends.
No speeches! What's a little swim after sticking worms and ogres?
Each fit for a hero... My uncle fashioned a hammer for Thor. Twas he named it Mjolnir. Grandfather forged Excalibur... You won't ever see finer craftsmanship.
Oh, but I have.
How came you by this blade?
I slew the Lindfarne Worm with it.
The Avatar. I like the sound of it.
Sigurd the Volsung slew Fafnir with that blade... See the line where Regin welded the break?
Uhm... fine work.
Achilles wore it before the gates of Troy.
Achilles wore it before the gates of Troy.
You're well equipped, I'd say. Legendary arms...
You're with us in battle.
May God protect you.
No hurt Jimmy, sir... oh no, please, sir...

Is he a friend, then?
Yes, yes... Jimmy Squarefoot good friend to one and all...

Plenty treasure inside... Jimmy seen it once.
You've been inside?
You've been inside?
In a dream.
In a dream.
Don't speak to me of dreams! I feel I've been dreaming since the unicorn was killed.
Marco!
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
I'm not cheating! I'm not looking!
Dad's disappeared!
He was there and then he wasn't!
And we got to take all the old paint off all the doors and then George taught us how to stain everything and he even let me choose the color I liked best! And he said he loved me!
We did a lot of the wiring too.
We did a lot of the wiring too.
With Dale. Oh, and I got to drill a hole into a board to put the wire through!
Are you going to see Sam again?
I thought I might stop by.
You can go back to bed...or Lois might let you go swimming.
I wanna be with you today.
I wanna be with you today.
Oh, honey. There's not much to do there. I mean, it's all work.
Oh, honey. There's not much to do there. I mean, it's all work.
We can work.
I woke up this morning at three and couldn't fall back asleep. Everyday I think I see more of Sam than I've seen in years.
Sam!
Did you know him before you knew Dad?
Since seventh grade.
And video games after!
Home after. Will you come in and say "hi"?
That's how you get things right is to always try and never give up. Huh, Mom?
I guess it depends on what you give up on.
He's not there.
He's here. Check the bathroom.
He's here. Check the bathroom.
I checked everywhere. He's not there.
When does George get to come see his house?
It's so beautiful.
What's that for?
Mom said I should.
Mom said I should.
Oh.
Oh.
I would have anyway.
So put your plans of my room in the trash.
I don't think Dad wants you home.
He hasn't called?
Who are you?
Do you guys feel like painting?
What color?
What color?
Red.
Red.
I love red! That's my favorite color!
Mom?
Here, honey!
I put him to work.
What's wrong?
I couldn't get it to go down.
And why was the alarm on?

I couldn't sleep last night.
I couldn't sleep last night.
I'm supposed to be mad at you, but I'm not.
Why? What do you mean?
Uh...using Josh like that.
I'm going to bed.
Has he eaten anything at all?
I'd be more comfortable if he slept in the guestroom.
I'd be more comfortable if you hadn't slept with Josh. And George would be more comfortable if he weren't dying.
Atonement.
Who are all these people?
Sorry I got you into trouble.
I'll survive.
He must.
He seems lonely.
He seems lonely.
Are you his friend?
Are you his friend?
No.
No.

I'm not shaving my legs or pits this summer, I've decided.
Can you keep Sam straight?

You have to ask like that?
I want you to try something with me, okay?
I want you to try something with me, okay?
I've taken a lot of morphine. Oral morphine...for my back. Can I wait till I can say no and sound convincing?
Did you feel anything?
Maybe your tongue...I don't know, my mouth is numb. Why did you do that?
My mother would die.
Let's shut up and not kill her.
It's not what I was expecting.
What did you think it would be?
What did you think it would be?
I don't know... More like when I kissed Sam.
I'm hungry! Where's my dinner? Who ate my dinner? Huh? Who's in trouble now?
Hi.
Hey.
What are you doing here?
They're trying to make me spend the summer here. I'm leaving in the morning.

We've known each other since grade school.
I mean, but did you both go camping on weekends? Listen to music? Masturbate together? Talk on the phone?
I wouldn't want you as a friend.
George just never really...aimed that high. Even with not hitting a rabbit. I knew you were doing that, by the way. That's why I stopped doing it with you. You were no fun. It was always like you were frightened. Quiet and boring.
Funny how he's the architect and you're just a loud mouth cop.
He builds models for architects. His dad, on the other hand, was the real deal. Designed and built the coolest houses I've ever seen.
Mr. Dokos says that your father missed his height envelope by six inches.
He wants the entire roof taken off and lowered.
Mr. Stevens?
I've been dreading you.
Bob Larson. Do you happen to have an unenclosed toilet in close proximity to a kitchen?
A violation?

I assume you'll fill the...uh, window, with glass?
If that's what it takes.
Mr. Stevens. One of your neighbors is adamant your home has exceeded its approved height. He's filed to have construction stopped immediately.
It's thirty feet.
It's thirty feet.
Well, if it is, we have a problem.
I have the permit.
After your last extension request and with Design Review and the Board of Adjustment and the appeals to the city council, was there an amended permit?
After your last extension request and with Design Review and the Board of Adjustment and the appeals to the city council, was there an amended permit?
