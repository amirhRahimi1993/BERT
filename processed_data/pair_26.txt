No. You screwed up my life just so you could get higher ratings. You never gave a shit about me.
Yeah? Well I'm not starting now.
I don't think so.
Yeah. Because, you didn't talk me into anything. Everything you wanted me to do, I wanted to do.
He's who we want to go with.
This guy.
This guy.
I polled my staff. The men say they'd hang around with him and the women say he's fuckable. And one of the men said he's fuckable.

I'm not sure about the entire concept.
Take him off the air.
What are you talking about? He's fine. He's out of the hospital already. The ratings are higher than ever.

I'm telling you, it's peaked. Ed TV is an over-inflated balloon. Get it off before it explodes all over us.
With all due respect, Cynthia you're nuts. I'm giving him another month!
Good luck.
Isn't this getting kind of pathetic. I mean we drank the juice, now we're just licking peel. Let it go!
Cynthia, I think you're laboring under a misconception. You seem to believe that because you happened to predict this, we should be impressed. We're not. Anybody in any business can predict failure. 1 need people who prevent failure. I want to see this thing turned back in the right direction. Remember this was your baby.
Where are you going?
I've got this great idea. We put together a video. "The Network Executives Goofiest Moments." And listen, i've really loved working here.
Mr. Pekurny.

I know you. This Shari is a passing fancy.
No! I -- All right, look, if you hear from Ray.... tell him to call me, okay?

I can't believe you're taking his side.
I'm not! I'm just trying to get some facts.

What's the difference?
The difference is for twenty years I thought one thing and now it's another thing.
Oh my God. You and Al were - and that's why you threw him out.
He had a woman in my own bed! And how dare you call him "Dad" in front of Al. This is your father. This is who was there for you when you needed someone.
If I don't call you "Dad" it' just because... 1 was already a big boy when you came into our lives -- or when I thought you came into our lives --
And what did he come back now for?
And what did he come back now for?
Who?

We had people, news people, regular people, just sleeping in our hallway, going through our mail, our garbage. I mean it was she couldn't take it anymore. Now I've got to move. I can't afford this place by myself.

She wouldn't tell me.
Well, Ed, that's ... not really possible.
All right, I'11 pay for the parking. Big network!
I can't?
Well, no. You agreed to stay on the air as long as we asked you to. The station entered into this on that understanding. If you had refused we'd have begun this with somebody else. You can't just change the rules in the middle of the game, son. It's not fair to us. More importantly, it's not fair to the viewers. They're interested in

Not too good. That's why it states in your contract that if you do not continue to live a normal life, you're in violation and are liable for the station's financial losses. Ed, I urge you to reconsider. I urge you on behalf of all those people out there whose lives have become so entwined with yours. Play fair with them, Ed.

She lied to me. I mean all my life, she's telling me one story and then... it turns out to be a completely different story. Come to me at some point -- tell me the truth. No. Not in my house.

Well, yeah, everybody's someone. But I mean someone they want to be. I mean let's face it, I'm working in the video store, no one's coming in saying "oh, I wish I was that guy. 1 wish was rewinding that huge pile of tapes." At least for a month I'm not just a guy with a name tag. I'm famous.
This is going right up your ass.
Come on.
Kinda'.
It's what I do. I yell "Geronimo" and jump out of a relationship.
You weren't able to make me feel safe or secure -- no easy job for any man, I admit -- and my problem is, if I think I'm losing, I pull myself out of the game. I bail. See? I told you, I'm the love coroner.

What do we have to do?
My lovely assistant, Shari. I'm glad you asked. The contest is who can dig up -- legally, of course -- I'm not suggesting that anyone break any laws -- the most embarrassing and humiliating facts about any of the executives here at the North American Broadcasting System which owns Real TV.
But facts! They have to be verified. Anything from their past, their present, business, personal -- arrests, affairs ... And whoever comes up with the sleaziest, most degrading material -- I'11 give you ten thousand dollars. And you get to be on Ed TV. Hah?
So act now. Here's Ed's home phone number.
What's up?
Where were you?
Where were you?
I was... having dinner with Shari and her parents.
What do you mean all of a sudden? You've been going with her six months.
I know. I mean I'm sitting there and her father's asking me about my "career prospects" and I'm playing "Risk," with her kid brother, Leon and at dinner the dog's sniffing at my balls -- at least I hope it was the dog. 'Cause her mother disappeared for a while.
You know, that would be like a great thing.
What?
What?
That! Being that guy. Being the guy they watch.
That! Being that guy. Being the guy they watch.

Yeah, but let's stay on one subject. Whoever that person is is going to be famous. They'll be able to get whatever they want. They'll ... trust me, this is my business.

You know what your problem is?

Yeah. My problem is I've got a brother who writes a sentence like "We grew up in a small, little bedroom." As opposed to a big, little bedroom?
Yeah. My problem is I've got a brother who writes a sentence like "We grew up in a small, little bedroom." As opposed to a big, little bedroom?

Me?! That's you!
Me?! That's you!
I commit. I take a chance. You wanted to be the guy on TV, but you didn't want to say you wanted to. So you have me talk you into it so you get what you want, but if it goes bad it's not your fault.
And each contestant gets one of these. An "I tried to screw a network executive" tee-shirt.
A hundred per cent cotton. Okay, here we go, Andy.

I love you! 1 want to marry you!
Hello.
Hi.
You don't recognize me.
No. Am I supposed to?

I need help. How many times if just one little thing that I needed would've happened, it would've changed everything. If I had a few dollars when an opportunity came along or... the tumblers just never clicked for me.
All right... This is my father, I don't know what the hell he can do, but if anyone out there can help him -- get him a job - I'11 ... help you. I'11 ... mention your business or ... I don't know, we'11 figure it out. I gotta go.

Do you still have it?

Yeah. Why?
Look, can we all just sign the releases so we can get on with this?
What happened? You described this "crazy-kooky" family who'd be a million laughs on TV?
We don't have foibles.
Everyone has foibles. Then the whole country sees them on TV and mocks them. Then we have... mocked foibles.
Look, my life is not so great, that I want it shown on television. And neither is yours.
That's the point -- this could change things.

A few months before the election, she'd had an affair with my best friend Dave Novotny.
Don't tell me that. I don't want to know that.
Don't tell me that. I don't want to know that.
She's incredible. Everything just gets soaked.
You could tell Dave was one of those guys who taught because they never wanted to leave high school in the first place, and that could get a little irritating sometimes, but basically he was a real good guy.
Foxy. . . Foxy. . . You know you're a cute little heartbreaker... Foxy... You know you're a sweet little love maker...
You did it at your house? Your own house?
Look, Jim... Okay. I know it all seems crazy, and maybe it did start out, you know, for the... for the sex and the danger. But now it's different. Jim, what I'm trying to tell you is that Tracy and I are totally, totally in love.

But you haven't written your novel.
But you haven't written your novel.
That's the whole point. It's all in my head; it's right here. I just got to get it out there. Tracy wants me to write it so she can read it. It's beautiful.

Dave, I'm just saying this as your friend. What you're doing is really, really wrong, and you've got to stop.
You're not just jealous, are you? I mean, we both used to talk about her
That was just talk! Fantasy talk! What are you, nuts? We talk about girls all the time, but it doesn't mean anything. I would never. . . I mean, I take very seriously our strict moral code. The line you've crossed is... it's illegal and it's immoral.

Sherry Sherry Sheerrry. ...
He ended up moving back to Milwaukee to live with his parents. I haven't heard from him in a long time. Poor guy. I warned him.
One night he took us editors out to celebrate after a deadline. Eventually Dave and I were left alone and we got to talking - not like teacher and student, but like two adults.
You know, Tracy... I don't know how to say this, but...
what?
Well, I notice you don't seem to have any close friends at Millard. You seem to be kind of a loner.

No, I'm not. I'm just really busy.

Tracy, I've been watching you for going on two years now, and I think you are one of the most talented, hard-working, sensitive, attractive, brilliant students -- no, human beings -- I have ever met. I mean, you're the real thing. Special.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And I know sometimes people like you have to pay a price for their greatness, and that price is loneliness.
It was the first time somebody ever saw the real me, the me that nobody else knows.
Here, get down.
Thank God for Diane. She was my best friend, my source of love and strength. Oh sure, we'd had our share of bumpy times, but we'd always seen them through. After nine years of marriage, we were closer than ever. And the secret? Good communication.
Anything wrong?
Anything wrong?
Everything's fine. Just, you know, school.
Around that time Diane and I were hanging out a lot at Sherry Novotny's house, giving her our love and support and helping her make it through a difficult time.
Jim, don't. You're scaring him.
Jim, don't. You're scaring him.
He likes it.

Well, Sherry's great. But she can be a little much sometimes.
Don't you smartass me! Don't you dare smartass me! You just shut your mouth I Now your mother and I have had a long talk with Halt Hendricks --- we just got off the phone with him at home. You know, he doesn't want you back at Millard. He's fed up with you. Fed up! And I don't blame him!

Having a problem with your eye there?
Dick.
All right. Well, sure nice to meet you.
So nice
What? Right. So let's start counting.
Well, I thought that... well, the way it always works is that SGA president does a count, then the SGA advisor, you know, for the two independent counts.

You have the key, Mr. McAllister.
I just want to get this over with, so we can have the assembly and go home. We don't have much time until eighth period. I have other things going on, too, you know.
Okay. Yeah. We know
Okay. Yeah. We know
All right. I'll be back

Huh. Okay. Well, I guess I'd better do my count.
Larry?
Yeah?
Yeah?
I think we've got a problem.
Mostly Tammy fans
See, it doesn't add up. There are only 801 ballots but 803 people voted. Two votes are missing. Check the register.

Larry? We've got twenty-five minutes until the assembly, and we still have to do counts for VP, Treasurer and Secretary. Mr. Hendricks and I have both verified the numbers, and unless you can come up with the ballots you claim are missing -
But, Mr. M. -
Good morning, Mr. McAllister.
Not wasting any time, are you, Tracy?
Not wasting any time, are you, Tracy?
You know what they say about the early bird.

Yes, I do.
Well, good luck there, Tracy
Thanks, Mr. M.
Okay. But we're still missing something key here. What are we missing?
I know.

Tracy.
Tracy.
Ethics are...
Now at the end of her junior year, Tracy was poised to win the presidency of the student body. And so far she was running unopposed.
...the rules of conduct determined by a culture at a...

Oh. There's one more thing about Tracy I think you should know.
I got all my signatures. One hundred and fifty-eight -- way more than I need!
Hey, that's super

Here they are.
Here they are.
You can put those in my box. I'll look at them tomorrow.

Okay, fine. Sure

I can't wait to start campaigning.
Should be easy. So far no competition.

Yeah. Okay. well, good luck Tracy
You know, Mr. M., when I win the presidency, that means you and I are going to be spending a lot of time together next year. And I for one would like that time to be harmonious and productive. Wouldn't you?
Sure
Sure
Okay. That's good. I just wanted to make sure.
Okay. That's good. I just wanted to make sure.
Good luck, Tracy.
Fuck me, Mr. McAllister
So like I was saying, things were going pretty well in my life.
You're the advisor. You should stop her. She's not qualified. She's just a sophomore.
Calm down, Tracy. Just calm down.
Calm down, Tracy. Just calm down.
Are you sure all her signatures are real? It's not easy to get all those signatures.
Are you sure all her signatures are real? It's not easy to get all those signatures.
As far as I know, they--
These are a bunch of burn-outs. And look at this one, I can't even read this one.
Looks like Tim Kobza.
Tim Kobza? Tim Kobza! Who's he? I've never heard of him!
Look, why don't we just forget about Tammy? We'll have the assembly tomorrow, everybody'll make their speeches, and I'm sure everything will be fine.
I guess you know why you're here
If it's about the posters, I think it's so awful. It's a travesty.
If it's about the posters, I think it's so awful. It's a travesty.
A travesty. Huh. That's interesting, because I think you did it.
A travesty. Huh. That's interesting, because I think you did it.
Wait - are you accusing me? You're not serious. I can't... Mr. McAllister, we have worked together on SGA for three solid years and... I mean, I can't believe it. I'm... I'm shocked!
Mr. M., I am running on my qualifications. I would never need to resort to, you know, to vandalism like a, you know... Plus, my own best banner was torn down. Did I do that too?
Were you or were you not working in the Watchdog office over the weekend?
Were you or were you not working in the Watchdog office over the weekend?
I was. So? Mr. Pecharda let me in. As you know, with all my responsibilities I often come in on the weekend and have permission to do so. But I left very early, around 6:30.
I was. So? Mr. Pecharda let me in. As you know, with all my responsibilities I often come in on the weekend and have permission to do so. But I left very early, around 6:30.
6:30. How do you know what time the posters were torn down?
6:30. How do you know what time the posters were torn down?
I don't. I just know they were there when I left. I'm giving you helpful information is all. You know, instead of wasting time interrogating me, we should be out there trying to find out who did this.
I don't. I just know they were there when I left. I'm giving you helpful information is all. You know, instead of wasting time interrogating me, we should be out there trying to find out who did this.
Okay, Tracy, so who do you think did it? Whom should we "interrogate?"
Okay, Tracy, so who do you think did it? Whom should we "interrogate?"
well, I don't know. It could have been anybody. There are a lot of, you know, subversive elements around Millard. You know, like Rick Thieson and Kevin Speck and those burn-outs. Or Doug Schenken - what about him? Or what about Tammy Metzier? Her whole thing is being anti- this and anti-that.
You're a very intelligent girl, Tracy. You have many admirable qualities. But someday maybe you'll learn that being smart and always being on top and doing whatever you need to do to get ahead, and yes, stepping on people to get there, well, there's a lot more to life than that. And in the end, you're only cheating yourself.
Why are you lecturing me?
Why are you lecturing me?
This isn't the time or the place to get into it, but there is, for just one example, a certain former colleague of mine, who made a very big mistake, a life mistake.

I agree. But I also think certain young and naive people need to thank their lucky stars and be very, very grateful the whole school didn't find out about certain indiscretions which could have ruined their reputations, and chances to win certain elections.

And I think certain older persons like you and your "colleague" shouldn't be leaching after their students, especially when some of them can't even get their own wives pregnant. And they certainly shouldn't be running around making slanderous accusations. Especially when certain young, naive people's mothers are para-legal secretaries at the city's biggest law firm and have won many successful lawsuits. And if you
Yes?
Looks like today's your lucky day
What do you mean?
You're off the hook. Tammy here has confessed.
I told you! I told you! You're going to pay for my banner!
That's enough, Tracy. Quit while you're ahead, okay? I'll handle this. Could you ask Walt to come in?
Act surprised. Walk slowly to the podium. Be modest. Thank them for this incredible honor.
That said, the whole point of an election is to choose winners, and that you have done. We'll begin with president.
Hello, Mr. M.
Hello, Tracy.
So what brings you here?
I'm looking at new cars.

Nooo. I just thought... l mean, I am looking for a new car. But I just thought, well, I'm going away soon, and you'll be stuck here and, I don't know, I just think maybe if things had been different we might have been, well, friends. Real friends. And then things would be different. Don't you think?
Well, I... I... that's very nice of you.
I've got an idea.
What's this?
My house.
I want you to do something for me.
Swallows, unsure what heaven or hell awaits him.

Take as much room as you want
I'm scared, Mr. M. I kind of don't feel ready for college.
You'll be fine.
You'll be fine.
I hope so
I hope so
You will.
That little bitch made a fool of us I want her out of the election. Getting everybody all riled up like that. She's finished, you hear me? Washed up.
Walt, we can't throw her out of the election just because we don't like her speech. That's not what student government's about.
Walt, we can't throw her out of the election just because we don't like her speech. That's not what student government's about.
Yeah... whatever. All I know is she's a troublemaker. She's on my list.
Jim, where the hell have you been?
Nowhere. I don't have class until second period.
Nowhere. I don't have class until second period.
Even tried you at home. We've got a situation here.
Well, that speech she gave -- it was pretty, you know, pretty out there. But we'll get to the bottom of it. Don't you worry. Mr. McAllister is going to see to that. Right, Jim?
Oh yeah, you bet.
Life would go on, and I would certainly be a stronger and wiser person from the experience.
Uh, Jim?
Uh, Jim?
Hmm?
Hmm?
Walt needs to see you.
Walt needs to see you.
Oh. Okay.
Walt will be speaking with you about this, but I need you to find someone to take over my classes. The lesson plans for the rest of the year are in my top right drawer.
Okay, Jim. I understand.

Yeah.
Yeah.
But you've got a big choice right now. You can choose to be depressed about it for the rest of your life. Or you can choose to see it for what it really is: an opportunity. I personally think you have a big future ahead of you, and I don't mean the fleeting glory of sports.

What do you mean?
What do you mean?
Let me give you a clue. You're a born leader. You're one of the most popular students at Millard. You're honest and straightforward. You don't choke under pressure, as we all saw in that amazing fourth quarter against Westside. The other kids look up to you. What does that spell?
Who, me? Nooo. I never... I don't know anything about that stuff, Mr. M. Besides, that's Tracy Flick's thing. She's always working so hard and --
Yeah, no, she's a go-getter, all right.
Yeah, no, she's a go-getter, all right.
And she's super-nice

Okay, let's say
Okay, let's say
No, wait -- apples. Apples.
Fine. Let's say all you ever knew was apples. Apples, apples and more apples. You might think apples were pretty good, even if you occasionally got a rotten one. Then one day there's an orange. And now you can make a decision. Do you want an apple, or do you want an orange? That's democracy.
I also like bananas.
I also like bananas.
Exactly. So what do you say? Maybe it's time to give a little something back.
Oh, no. No. I'm just finishing up here, and I've got to get home.
Why don't you guys go sit down, okay? I'll catch up in a minute? I want to talk to Mr. M. about some important stuff.
And on Halloween we could have a haunted house. But a really good haunted house, not like those cheesy bad ones. You know, more like the radio station ones. This one would be really scary. And for Homecoming -- well, you know how last year's theme was -

Oh, okay. Yeah, sorry.
Just one more thing. So, Mr. M., uh, do you think Tracy's going to be okay? I saw her face after the assembly, and I think she's taking it pretty hard.
Don't worry about Tracy. She'll be fine.

What do you want?
Oh. Hi, Tammy. I was just, you know, I went to all your teachers and got your assignments.

You found Patchett. You found me. You're smart enough. Be a detective if that's what you want.
That simple, huh?

And for good reason judging from what I know of your background.
What's going to happen to Stensland? He'll give himself cirrhosis over this. <u>He's one</u> <u>year from his pension</u>.

What work?
What work?
I've long been involved in containing hard crime in such a way that myself and a few colleagues might someday enjoy a profit dispensation. That day will soon be here and you'll share handsomely. Grand means will be in our hands, Wendell.

Imagine crime limited to the criminal element who perpetrate it. Imagine the means to keep the nigger filth sedated. But don't stop there. Extrapolate. Imagine the police in control. It's big, lad.

You have your extracurricular secrets, I have mine. We'll hold a clarification session soon. For now, I need your fearsome old habits at the Victory Motel. We're going to brace a man who may know who killed Jack Vincennes. Can I count on you?

Sure, boss. Sure you can.
You know him?
Seen him around. He used to be a cop.
Hey, partner. Grab a cup.
I got to write my report first.
Don't look so down in the mouth, Bud. You nailed him good.
Yeah, sure... I got a couple of hours before I have to be at the Victory. Want to grab a beer?

No. I'll tell you sometime. Not now. Don't want to jinx it. But it could take the edge off that jail time I got coming.
No. I'll tell you sometime. Not now. Don't want to jinx it. But it could take the edge off that jail time I got coming.
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
It's confidential, Bud. Like that magazines Vincennes scams for. <u>Hush-Hush</u>. I'll see you tomorrow. And hey, if it works out, you'll get a piece of it.
Mrs. Lefferts, I'm Officer White with the L.A.P.D. I'd like to ask a couple of questions.
Let my daughter rest in peace.
Let my daughter rest in peace.
Five minutes. That's all.
Tell me about the boyfriend she had. The one you mentioned at the morgue.
First I want to go on record as saying that my Susie was a virgin when she died.
First I want to go on record as saying that my Susie was a virgin when she died.
Ma'am, I'm sure she was.
Susie, I told you I didn't approve of that boyfriend. He was too old for you. You let him come into this house and be fresh to me. I went out one day and old Mrs. Jensen next door saw Susan's boyfriend and another man and thought she heard a ruckus.
What was that boyfriend's name?
What was that boyfriend's name?
We were never properly introduced. Susan and I were fighting that day. She called him by a nickname. Muns or Lunts or something.

Stens? Was it Stens?
Stens? Was it Stens?
Maybe. I don't know.
Maybe. I don't know.
Look at a picture for me.
That's him. That's him.
You said a neighbor heard a ruckus. Was it outside, inside?
What's through here?
No! Please leave!
Don't mind the smell. I think a rat died behind the wall... My Susie was a good girl!
Easy. Tell me about the ruckus.
Easy. Tell me about the ruckus.
I came home that night and there was blood on the floor. Susan said Stams -- Stens had cut himself. They were acting nervous. And that Stens kept going under the house.
Was it... a rat?
Yeah. A great big one.
Where are we going?
It's a surprise. You like surprises, don't you, White?
Yeah, that's Stens.
Hell of a way to avoid a prison sentence.
What happened?
Someone held up a coffee shop, panicked and killed six people.
One in six. Where's the girl?
Officer White, put down that weapon and --
A naked guy with a gun? You expect anyone to believe that?
Get the fuck away from me.
How's it going to look on your report?
It'll look like justice. That's what that fat fuck got. <u>Justice</u>.
It'll look like justice. That's what that fat fuck got. <u>Justice</u>.
You don't know what the word means, you dumb bastard.
Why?
Lynn.
Lynn.
She told you?
I knew Stensland and Meeks knew each other. Meeks was with Sue Lefferts on Christmas Eve. The night I met Lynn. Lefferts' mother I.D.ed Stensland as Lefferts' boyfriend, but Stens pretended he didn't know either one of them.
Stensland and Meeks. What were they up to?
Stensland and Meeks. What were they up to?
Johnny Stompanato told me when Meeks disappeared, he was trying to move the 18 pounds of heroin that went missing when Deuce Perkins was shot.

<u>Stensland and Buzz Meeks</u>. Two-man triggers knocking off Mickey Cohen lieutenants. When they killed Deuce Perkins, they got heroin as a bonus.

Then something goes wrong. Meeks gets killed. Maybe Stens got greedy, killed Meeks and left him under his girlfriend's house. The night he died, Stens was all mysterious. Said he had something big going down.

Pierce Patchett figures in, too. That's the angle Jack was working. Dudley must work for Patchett.
Let's just kill them.
Let's just kill them.
What?
What?
For Jack, for Stensland, for anybody else who got in the way. I've been trying to be smart. A detective. But killing those two fuckers, that would be justice.

Let's go see Pierce Patchett. Run a good-cop-bad-cop.
Which one are you and which one am I?
You expecting problems?
Patchett uses a lot of ex-cop muscle.
It's a suicide note. Says he killed Jack because Jack had figured out a pornography scam Patchett was running.
He had help getting up there. Two of his fingers are broken.

What about him?

Jack thought he was up to his neck in all this.
Bud...
If I let you go, there'll be ten more lawyers to take your place tomorrow. They just won't come on the bus, that's all.
They never made a match on the shotgun serial numbers. What if Breuning and Carlisle took them from the evidence room? Couple of cold pieces that had been hanging around a year or two.
We should check the records, and, we should talk to Lynn.
You wanted to meet here?
Me? You called it. I got a message that...
You figured this was a set-up? And you showed up anyway?
A lot of bad stuff happened here. It's as good a place as any for it to end.
You know, all I ever wanted was to measure up to my father.
I spent years trying not to live down to mine.
She's fine.
I'm not asking you.
Are you Pierce Patchett?
I am. Are you soliciting for police charities? The last time, you people called at my office.

Sue Lefferts died at the Nite Owl. I'm investigating.

He no longer works for me. Find Susan's killer, Mr. White. I'll give you a handsome reward. <u>Whatever you desire</u>.
Thanks, but no thanks.

Then listen closely, because I'll only say this once and if it gets repeated, I'll deny it. I run call girls. Lynn Bracken is one of them and so was Susan Lefferts. I treat my girls very well. I have grown daughters, myself, and I don't like the thought of women being hurt. I sense you share this feeling.

And you fuck people up for a living. That don't make me you. <u>Capisce</u>, shitbird?
Wendell White, how's tricks, <u>paesano</u>?
I ain't your <u>paesano</u>, you wop cocksucker.

You remember an ex-cop named Buzz Meeks? He works for a guy named Patchett.
Should I?
His file listed you as a known associate. Now spill.

Oh, yeah. That was a long time ago. Before your day. The last few years he's been muscle for hire. But I heard he's disappeared.

Before Meeks disappeared he was popping off about trying to move eighteen pounds of heroin.

Deuce Perkins. Mickey C's narcotics lieutenant. The night he got clipped, eighteen pounds of Mickey's heroin went missing.
Meeks is probably in Rio or someplace like that by now.
He's under a tract house in San Berdoo. And he don't smell too good. What happened to the heroin, Johnny?

Ed, your observations have been astute. What's your assessment of this situation?
The public demands justice, sir. This was a full-fledged riot of policemen. Shift the guilt to men whose pensions are secured. Force them to retire. But someone has to swing. Indict, try and convict Stensland and Bud White. Secure them jail time. Feed them to the sharks, sir. Protect yourself; protect the department.
I want to know who we give the public in contrast? The department needs role models. Clean-cut, <u>forthright</u> men the public can admire.
I'll testify, sir. I'm not afraid to do what's right.
I'll testify, sir. I'm not afraid to do what's right.
And I'll promote you. You'll be a lieutenant immediately.
Ed, you're 30. Your father didn't make lieutenant until he was 33.
I know that, sir. I also know that when he made lieutenant, it was as a detective.
Jack Vincennes. He's the technical advisor on 'Badge of Honor,' sir. He lives for it. That's the way to get him.
All right, Ed. Call Sergeant Vincennes.
I got the rap sheets on the black guys, sir. Coates and Jones got charges a mile long. But except for some kid stuff, Fontaine's clean.
Clean?

More or less.

What does that have to do --
Okay so we worked together. It was an information exchange. I got him first class collars and he got me good stories. We were friends for Chrissakes!
Alright. We'll drop that line for now. Next topic. Please comment on Pierce Patchett.
Okay. Okay. Everyone knows Patchett's worth a boat-load of greenbacks. From aviation, freeway construction. But the man has hobbies, too. He bankrolls B movies under the table and runs movie star look-alike hookers. And try this on: he's rumored to be a periodic heroin sniffer. All in all a powerful behind-the- scenes strange-o.
And?
And?
And what?
Reciprocity, Mr. Hudgeons, is the key to all relationships.
He runs call girls. Primo tail. Fixed up like movie stars.
And?
In my car. Blackmail shit. The trunk under the carpet. Patchett got me to photograph a cop fucking this gorgeous cunt Lynn, looks just like Veronicaaa --

White's a mindless thug.

No, Edmund. He's a man who can answer yes to those questions I ask you from time to time.
You'll reap the benefits, but are you truly prepared to be despised within the department?
Yes, Dudley. I am.
Yes, Dudley. I am.
So be it.
You should stay away from a man when his blood is up.

I'm loathe to kill my brother officers, Edmund.
Tell that to Jack Vincennes. To Stensland.

Jack was a shame, but Dick Stensland had the audacity to try to sell me my own heroin. Through his whore girl friend. I sent him to make the buy. The rest is history.

Why?
Why?
A vacuum, Edmund. That's what we have in Los Angeles. Sending Mickey Cohen up created it. My containment work maintained it. Certain photographs guarantee it. Organized crime has been held back, but there's still a demand for the services it provides.

And now you'll provide them.
And now you'll provide them.
Absolutely. Prostitution and gambling are victimless crimes. The heroin we'll run down to the coloreds. Anesthetize them. As long as it's not a middle class problem, no one will care. It's still a crime free city... for respectable people.
<u>No</u>.
Why not, lad? Absolute justice?

Something like that.

John, I doubt you've ever drawn a stupid breath. Don't start now.
Okay. I'll do it.
You think golden boy can handle it, Cap?
I think you'll be surprised what Edmund's capable of.

Twelve years ago he worked a vice roust with Dick Stensland. They arrested a Pierce Patchett on an extortion scam. Guy ran hookers. He'd have them photographed with their johns, then double-dip for some blackmail. Charges got dropped. Insufficient evidence. You were supervising officer on the case and I was wondering if you remember anything about it.

He'd have them photographed with their johns, then double-dip for some blackmail. Charges got dropped. Insufficient evidence. You were supervising officer on the case and I was wondering if you remember anything about it.
What's this all about, lad?

Part of it has to do with a murder. I've been working with Ed Exley on it.

Don't start trying to do the right thing, John. You haven't had enough practice.
Have you discussed this with anyone else, John?
No.
No.
Not even with Exley?
You're the key witness?
That's right.

I should've known. What's the Chief throwing you?

You're playing an angle, college boy. You're getting something out of this so you don't have to hobnob with the fucking rank and file cops who'll hate your guts for snitching. If they're making you a detective, watch out. Some Bureau guys are gonna burn in this and you're gonna have to work with friends of theirs.

I want you to follow Bud White.

You should be the last person who wants to dig any deeper into the Nite Owl, <u>Lieutenant</u>.
Is there more to that, or do I have to guess?
Rollo was a purse snatcher. My father ran into him off duty. He shot my father six times and got away clean. No one even knew who he was. I made the name up to give him some personality.

So what's the point?
So what's the point?
Rollo's the reason I became a cop. I wanted to catch the guys who thought they could get away with it. It was supposed to be about truth and justice and Rollo. But somewhere along the way I forgot all that... How about you, Jack? Why'd you become a cop?
I'm trying to figure what angle you're playing <u>this</u> time, but I sure as hell can't see one.
I've given up angles for awhile. I just want to solve this thing.

Okay, college boy, I'll help you. But I want half the collar.
A third. I don't think we can make a case without Bud White.
What's that for?
Bud White. He sees us and we're dead.
Jesus... Maybe White's not so dumb after all.

We got a total of forty-five spent 12-gauge Remington shotgun shells. Three men with five-shot-capacity pumps. All of them reloading twice.
Hold on... We need to canvass. See if a purple Mercury was seen around here tonight.
The Nite Owl. Anything bothering you about the case?
Yeah. The fact that you guys won't let it get filed away.
Yeah. The fact that you guys won't let it get filed away.
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
Bud White grilled me on it this morning. You know, he's not as dumb as I thought.
We got a dead ex-cop and a girl who looks like Rita Hayworth at the Nite Owl. Another dead ex-cop under the house of Rita's mother. It's not a good week for ex-cops.
I got Vincennes in the next room. It's not a good week for cops in general.
I'll tell you what I told Officer White when he asked me about Susan's death.
Bud White's been here?

Miss Bracken, I'm Lieutenant Exley.
I know who you are. You're the policeman Bud told me about.
I know who you are. You're the policeman Bud told me about.
Really? What did White say?
Really? What did White say?
He said you were smart. He also said you were competing with your dead father. How did he put it? Trying to measure up to a ghost.
Let's concentrate on my smarts. Pierce Patchett made you, didn't he? He taught you how to dress and talk and think and I am very impressed with the results. But I need some answers and if I don't get them, I'm going to take you and Patchett down.
He can take care of himself and I'm not afraid of you. And you forgot one thing, Lieutenant. Pierce also taught me how to fuck... Can I get you a drink?
I'm curious about you.
Why?
It galls you that I know so much about you. You don't have information to compete.
Don't underestimate me, Miss Bracken.
Don't underestimate me, Miss Bracken.
The way you've underestimated Bud White?
How was I?
Oh, the best I ever had. Absolutely the best.

I see Bud because I want to. I see Bud because he can't hide the warmth he has inside him.
I'll take your word for it.
I'll take your word for it.
I see Bud because he makes me feel like Lynn Bracken and not some Veronica Lake look-alike who fucks for money. I see him because he doesn't know how to disguise who he is. There's more if you want to hear it.
Does all that make it harder for you to hate him or easier?
I don't hate White. I really don't. It's just, in my business, it's the wild cars you have to watch out for.
I don't hate White. I really don't. It's just, in my business, it's the wild cars you have to watch out for.
You don't like that you don't know how to play him. He doesn't follow the same rules of politics you do. That makes him dangerous.

Because you'll use it against me. Won't you?
You're tougher than Bud thinks you are.
You're the first person to ever call me tough.

You, me and White, huh?

Actually, Bud's only tough on the outside.
If I knew you were coming I'd have baked a cake.
Forget everything else for a second, Lynn. Is there anything you can give me on Dudley Smith?
A police captain. I think he's behind all of this.
I work for Patchett. I had a feeling that there was someone else, but I never knew who.

It's okay. These are police. <u>What</u> do you want?
I want D.A. bureau men to tail Dudley Smith twenty-four hours a day; I want you to get a judge to authorize a wire tap on his home phone; I want authorization to check his bank records and I want it all in an hour.

Okay! You're right! Dudley's got photos of me and Reynolds.
What's Dudley's scheme?
It seems like my Susan, but...
When was the last time you saw her, Mrs. Lefferts?
When was the last time you saw her, Mrs. Lefferts?

It's Christmas morning in the City of Angels, and while decent citizens sleep the sleep of the righteous, hopheads prowl for marijuana, not knowing that a man is coming to stop them. The free- wheeling, big-time Big V, celebrity crime-stopper, Jack Vincennes, the scourge of grasshoppers and junk fiends everywhere. You like it, Jackie- Boy?
Yeah, it's subtle.
<u>Hush-Hush</u>. Off the record and on the Q.T.
Sid, it's Vincennes.
Sid, it's Vincennes.
Jackie, are you back on Narco? I need copy.
No. But I've got something going with Ad Vice.
Something good?

Don't know. I'm chasing picture books. Fuck shots, but the posers don't look like junkies. It's well done stuff. I thought you might have heard something.
Not a word.
What about Fleur-de-Lis? Their slogan's 'Whatever you desire.'

And Reynolds?
And Reynolds?
He's queer too. Metro paid him two grand a week to fake it with ingenues. On screen and off. I'm getting him to fuck the D.A. for a hundred bucks. That's twice the fifty you got for wrecking his career.
Sid, why would a guy like Pierce Patchett get involved with running dope and hookers?
Where'd you hear that?
Where'd you hear that?
Around.
Around.
Jackie, all I know is what you know. The man is very rich. And he's invested in freeway construction so he's gonna get a lot richer. But that's it. Patchett's what I like to call 'Twilight.' He ain't queer, he ain't Red, he can't help me in my quest for prime sinuendo.
Jackie! You got some good scoop for the Sidster?
Sid, cut the crap. I --
Sid, cut the crap. I --

Brill?
Brill's dead. He died of small pox when he was two and he was buried in a Kansas field. My name doesn't matter.
What happened?
It started with the information you gave me on DePinto. After we talked, he agreed to resign. Next, a phony detective asked me about Daniel Zavitz. Then an investigator questioned me about an extortion scheme they claimed Zavitz was behind. The FBI started looking into mob connections. A doctored picture in the paper. Overnight, I'm ruined. Wife. job, bank accounts, everything gone.
DePinto's dead.
Oh Jesus.

The NSA's been in bed with the entire tele-communications industry since the 40's. They've infected everything: Banks, computers, phones, mail, name it. The more technology we buy into, the easier it is keeping tabs on us. It's a brave new world. At least it better be.

Hard-line calls we'd pick off the relays as they were being fed into ground cables or fired up to the SATs. We'd suck in everything. All foreign, most domestic. Domestic was my group. Druggies, radicals, loud-mouths. Anyone we wanted.

Isn't Zerzura supposed to be protected by spirits who take on the shape of sandstorms?
What kind of fossils?
I can't sing. but I can tell a story. I might need a prompt. Do you have your Herodotus? I've noticed you carry it
I'm sorry - what have you noticed?
Daskylus
Yes, thank you, Gyges, son of Daskylus - Candaules said to him I don't think you believe me when I tell you how beautiful my wife is. And although Gyges replied he did find the Queen magnificent the King insisted he would find some way to prove beyond dispute that she was fairest of all women. Do you all know this story?
How much did you pay?

So why follow me? Escort me, by all means. Following me is predatory, isn't it?
This is an incredible story - about a man hunting an Ostrich, he's been telling me about Zerzura, he thinks he's been there, but his map, the route he's describing, he couldn't survive the journey now, but he's a poet, so his map is poetry - and now we're onto an Ostrich. I'm telling her your map is poetry. The Arab shrugs.
What do you mean, poetry?

A mountain curved like a woman's back, a plateau the shape of an ear.

Sounds perfectly clear. Where does the Ostrich come in?
Sounds perfectly clear. Where does the Ostrich come in?
The Ostrich is a detour. A poor man hunts an ostrich, it's the method. Nothing to do with Zerzura. To catch an ostrich you must appear not to move. The man finds a place where the ostrich feeds, a wadi, and stands where the ostrich can see him, on the horizon, and doesn't move, doesn't eat - otherwise the ostrich will run. At nightfall,
What is he saying? Come on, what did he say?
He said - be careful.

- there is the Harmattan, a red wind. Which Mariners called the sea of darkness. Red sand from this wind has flown as far as the south coast of England, producing showers so dense they were mistaken for blood. Almasy checks to see if Katharine is still awake.
Fiction. We had a house on that coast and it never rained blood. Go on. More.

All true. Herodotus, your friend, tells of a wind - the Simoon - so evil that a nation declared war on it and marched out to fight it in full battle dress, their swords raised.
Madox will have calculated how many miles, they'll soon turn around.
Oh my God, the others!
Could I ask you, please, to paste you paintings into my book? I should like to have them. I should be honored.
Of course. Is it, am I a terrible coward to ask how much water we have?
Of course. Is it, am I a terrible coward to ask how much water we have?
Water? Yes, we have water, we have a little in our can, we have water in the radiator which can be drunk. Not at all cowardly, extremely practical. Come on, come on! There's also a plant - I've never seen it but I'm told you can cut a piece the size of a heart from this plant and the next day it will be

Geoffrey's not in Cairo. He's not actually a buffoon. And the plane wasn't a wedding present. It belongs to the British Government. They want aerial maps of the whole North Africa. So I think he's in Ethiopia. In case you were counting on his sudden appearance.
And the marriage - is that a fiction?

No, no, it's Hungarian. My daijka sang it to me.
It's beautiful. What's it about?
It's beautiful. What's it about?
It's a long song - Szerelem means love and the story - there's a Hungarian Count, he's a wanderer, a fool. For years he's on some kind of quest, who knows what? And then one day he falls under the spell of a mysterious English woman - a harpy - who beats him and hits him and he becomes her slave. He sews her
Ouch! See - you're always beating me..!
You bastard, I was believing you!
This - what's it called? - this place, I love it - this is mine! I'm asking the King permission to call it the Almasy Bosphorous.
I thought we were against ownership? I can stay tonight.
Madox knows, I think. He's tried to warn me. He keeps talking about Anna Karenina. I think it's his idea of a man-to-man chat. Its my idea of a man-to-man chat.
This is a different world - is what I tell myself. A different life. And here I am a different wife.

That day, had you followed me to the market?

I'm not agreeing. Don't think I'm agreeing, because I'm not.
I just know - any minute he'll find out, we'll barge into somebody we'll - and it will ill him.
Don't go over it again, please.
I just wanted you to know. I'm not missing you yet. She nods, can't find this funny.
You will. You will.

Do you think you're the only one who feels anything? Is that what you think?
Katharine! Oh dear God, Katharine - what are you doing here?
I can't move. I can't get out.
Why did he bring you?
A surprise, he said.
Please don't move me. It hurts too much.
We've got to get you out of here.

You're wearing the thimble.

Listen to me, Katharine. You've broken your ankle and I'm going to have to try and bind it. I think your wrist might be broken, too - and some ribs, which is why it's hurting you to breathe. I'm going to have to walk to El Taj. Given all the traffic in the desert these days I should bump into one army or another
Do you promise? I wouldn't want to die here. I wouldn't want to die in the desert. I've always had a rather elaborate funeral in mind, with particular hymns. Very English. And I know exactly where I want to be buried. In our garden. Where I grew up. With a view of the sea. So promise me you'll come back for you.
I promise I'll come back. I promise I'll never leave you. And there's plenty of water and food. You can have a party.
And a good read. Don't waste it.
Thank you. Will you bury Geoffrey? I know he's dead.
Thank you. Will you bury Geoffrey? I know he's dead.
I'm sorry, Katharine.
I'm sorry, Katharine.
I know.
I know.
Every night I cut out my heart but in the morning it was full again.
Tell me about your garden.
Our Garden, our garden - not so much the garden, but the copse alongside it, wild, a secret way plunging down to the shore and then nothing but water between you and France. The Devil's Chimney it was called - The Devil's Chimney, I don't know why. Darling. My darling.
A broken car?
Still a car.
Uxoriousness - that's my favorite kind of love. Excessive love of one's wife.
There you have me.
What kind of photographs?
Portraits. The Brigadier, the Brigadier's wife, the Brigadier's dogs, the Brigadier at the Pyramids, the Brigadier breathing.
Safe journey.
You too. Good luck!

And the people here don't want us. Are you kidding? The Egyptians are desperate to get rid of the Colonials - isn't that right? Their best people get down on hands and knees begging to be spared a knighthood. Isn't that right?

Cut the ropes. I left a note, on his blanket. At the next Geographical Society I shall await with great interest the announcement of the Fenelon-Barnes Slave Knot. The Girl wouldn't leave, of course. Her father had sold her for a camel. He turns over the propeller, the engine cranks up.
I'll be back as quick as I can. Thirty-six hours at the outside.
Try to get a second radiator, we'll bury it between here and the Pottery Hill. And a better jack. We planned badly.

And where are the Expedition Maps?
In my room.
In my room.
Those maps belong to His Majesty's Government. They're confidential. They shouldn't be left lying around for any Tom, Dick or Mary to have sight of.

What's the matter with you?
Don't be so bloody naïve. You know there's a war breaking out. This arrived this morning. By order of the British Government - all International Expeditions to be aborted by May 1939.
Why do they care about our maps?
What do we find in the desert? Arrow heads, spears. In a war, if you own the desert, you own North Africa.

Good, we're all here? A toast, to the International Sand club - may it soon resurface.
Look, either shut up, or go home.
Absolutely right, shut up. Lashings of apologies all round.
Had a letter from my wife. The wisteria is still out, which I'm looking forward to. She says Dorset is gripped with Invasion Fever. Wrong coast I should have thought, still

I'll leave the plane in the hangar at Kufra Oasis. So if you need it hard to know how long one's talking about. We might all be back in a month or two.
I have to teach myself not to read too much into everything. Comes of too long having to read so much into hardly anything at all.
Goodbye, my friend. They shake hands.

Are you Hana?
Are you Hana?
What do you want?
What do you want?
I met your friend Mary. She said I should stop and see if you were okay. Apparently we're neighbors - my house is two blocks from yours in Montreal. Cabot, north of Laurier. Bonjour.

Bonjour.
They're fresh. I haven't eaten an egg in have you noticed there are chickens? You get chickens in Italy but no eggs. In Africa there were always eggs, but never chickens. Who separates them?
You were in Africa?
You were in Africa?
Yeah, for a while.
Yeah, for a while.
So was my Patient.
So was my Patient.
I'd like to stay. That's the long and short of it. I mean, you know blah-blah if it's convenient, if there's room blah-blah-blah. I have to do some work here -I speak the language. There are Partisans to be - -we embrace them and see if we can relieve them of their weapons, you know - while we hug. I was a thief, so

So you can shoot a pistol?
So you can shoot a pistol?
No.
No.
If you said yes I would have had a reason. You should let me redress those bandages. Before you go.
If you said yes I would have had a reason. You should let me redress those bandages. Before you go.
I'm okay. Look, it's a big house. We needn't disturb each other. I can shoot a pistol! I'll sleep in the stables. I don't care where I sleep. I don't sleep.
I'm okay. Look, it's a big house. We needn't disturb each other. I can shoot a pistol! I'll sleep in the stables. I don't care where I sleep. I don't sleep.
Because we're fine here. I don't know what Mary told you about me, but I don't need company, I don't need to be looked at.
Because we're fine here. I don't know what Mary told you about me, but I don't need company, I don't need to be looked at.
Fine. I'm not looking.
Supper. Hana calls after him.
Where've you been?
Where've you been?
Rabbit hunting.
I could help you. I could get you off that.
Can you cook the rabbit or will you try and bring that back to life?
It's a week. We didn't know where you were - or if you coming back, or -
You should be happy. What were you going to do for him when it ran out? He pulls out more phials from his jacket.
You should be happy. What were you going to do for him when it ran out? He pulls out more phials from his jacket.
What do you do? What are you doing here?
What do you do? What are you doing here?
Some gave me a dress. You know what's great? What I'm learning? You win a war and you not only gain the miles you get the moral ground. Everywhere I go, we're in the right. I like that.
Hana? Hana? Are you alright?
Don't touch me if you're going to try and fuck me.
Don't touch me if you're going to try and fuck me.
I'll have some of your water. It's hot.
You have to protect yourself from sadness. This is the thing I've learned. You're in love with him, aren't you? Your patient. Do you think he's a saint or something? Because of the way he looks? I don't think he is.
I'm not in love with him. I'm in love with ghosts. And so is he. He's in love with ghosts.
I'm not in love with him. I'm in love with ghosts. And so is he. He's in love with ghosts.
Who are his ghosts?
Who are his ghosts?
Ask him.
Ask him.
What if I told you he did this to me?
What if I told you he did this to me?
What? How could he have? When?
What? How could he have? When?
I'm one of his ghosts and he wouldn't even know. It's like he slammed a door in Cairo and it trapped my fucking hands in Tobruk.
I'm one of his ghosts and he wouldn't even know. It's like he slammed a door in Cairo and it trapped my fucking hands in Tobruk.
I don't know what that means.
I don't know what that means.
Ask him. Ask your saint who he is. Ask him who he's killed.
Ask him. Ask your saint who he is. Ask him who he's killed.
Please don't creep around this house.
Where did you find that?
I liberated it.
I liberated it.
I think that's called looting.
I think that's called looting.
No-one should own music. The real question is who wrote the song?
Well, then ask him his name!
What's happened? Kip! What's happening? Don't shoot, please, don't shoot anybody.
Buon' giorno.
She can take you as far as Florence.
She can take you as far as Florence.
I can get in the back.
Hello.
Finally! So you're our Canadian pickpocket?
Thief, I think, is more accurate.
I understand you were in Africa. Whereabouts?
I understand you were in Africa. Whereabouts?
Oh, all over.
Oh, all over.
All over? I kept trying to cover a very modest portion and still failed. Are you leaving us? Now's our opportunity to swap war wounds.
I think anybody she ever loves tends to die on her.
Are you planning to be the exception?
Are you planning to be the exception?
Me? You've got the wrong end of the stick, old boy. So - Caravaggio - Hana thinks you invented your name.
Me? You've got the wrong end of the stick, old boy. So - Caravaggio - Hana thinks you invented your name.
And you've forgotten yours.
And you've forgotten yours.
I told her you would never invent such a preposterous name.
I told her you would never invent such a preposterous name.
I told her you can forget everything but you never forget your name.
Are you outside? A beat and then Caravaggio shuffles in. Like an old boxer.
I can't hide anymore. I breathe like a dog. I lose my balance. Stealing's got harder. Caravaggio stares at the Herodotus.

Why do I feel if I had your book I would know everything?
Why do I feel if I had your book I would know everything?
I don't even know if it is my book. The Bedouin found it in the plane, in the wreckage. It's mine now. I heard your breathing and thought it might be rain. I'm dying for rain - of course I'm dying anyway - but I long to feel rain on my face.
Is it you? If I said Moose I look different, fuck, why shouldn't you?
Moose.
Moose.
First wedding anniversary - what do you call it?
First wedding anniversary - what do you call it?
I don't know. Paper. Is it? Paper? I don't remember.
Thought you'd never wake up!
What? Hana comes in, sleepily, frowns at the gramophone.
Irving Berlin.
For?
For?
Top Hat.
Top Hat.
Is there a song you don't know?
Have a drink.
I've had a drink. Fatal.
I've had a drink. Fatal.
Well, anything you do is likely to be fatal, so you know -
Well, anything you do is likely to be fatal, so you know -
Very true!
What? You and Madox? Or you and Katharine Clifton?
What?
Hana tells me you're leaving.
There are going to be trials, they want me to interpret, don't they know I'm allergic to courtrooms?
There are going to be trials, they want me to interpret, don't they know I'm allergic to courtrooms?
We shall miss you.
So, I come across the Hospital Convoy I was looking for this stuff, and some nurse, Mary, Hana's friend, tells me about you and Hana, hiding in a monastery, in purdah, whatever it is - retreat - how you'd come in from the Desert and you were burned and you didn't know your name but you knew the words to every song there was
Me?
Me?
I'd seen you writing in that book. At the Embassy in Cairo, when I had thumbs and you had a face. And a name.
I'd seen you writing in that book. At the Embassy in Cairo, when I had thumbs and you had a face. And a name.
I see.
I see.
Before you went over to the Germans, before you got Rommel's spy across the desert and inside British headquarters. He took some pretty good photographs - I saw mine in that torture room in Tobruk, so they made an impression.

And you thought you'd come and settle the score?
And you thought you'd come and settle the score?
You were the only man who knew the desert well enough, the only man who would cross seventeen hundred miles of nothing.

I had to get back to the desert. I made a promise. The rest meant nothing to me.

What did you say?
What did you say?
The rest meant nothing to me.
The rest meant nothing to me.
There was a result to what you did. It wasn't just another expedition. It did this. If the British hadn't unearthed your nosey photographer in Cairo thousands of people could have died.

Thousands of people did die, just different people.
Thousands of people did die, just different people.
But you were among the British, they were your friends - why betray them?
But you were among the British, they were your friends - why betray them?
Is that what you thought? That I betrayed the British? The British betrayed me. The British betrayed me.
And did you never see Katharine? You never got back to the Cave?
Yes, I got back there finally to keep my promise. To come back for her. And then of course I couldn't I couldn't even do that properly.
You get to the morning and the poison leaks away, doesn't it? Black nights, fucking black nights, when you want to howl like a dog. I thought I would kill you. You killed my friends, you ruined my hands. But the girl was always here, like some Guardian Angel.
You can't kill me. I died years ago.
You can't kill me. I died years ago.
No, now I can't kill you.
But then the Queen looked up and saw Gyges concealed in the shadows. And though she said nothing, she shuddered. The next day she sent for Gyges and challenged him. And hearing his story, she said this -
Off with his head!
The team is in mourning, darling.
Oh really?
I was just saying, I'm going to cable Downing Street, see if I can't stir up a few shillings - Katharine's mother and the PM's wife are best -
Darling, for goodness' sake!
Darling, for goodness' sake!
Well, she is!
Why do you think? About my staying?
Well look, if nobody minds, truly, then I suppose - I shall, of course, be bereft
Well look, if nobody minds, truly, then I suppose - I shall, of course, be bereft
Oh.
Oh.
But finally able to explore the Cairo night-life. I shall produce an authoritative guide to the Zinc Bars and - I want to say Harems - am I in the right country for Harems?
Darling, I just heard. You poor sausage, are you all right?
I'm fine. I got hot.
I'm fine. I got hot.
Lady H said she thought you might be -
Lady H said she thought you might be -
I'm not pregnant. I'm hot. I'm too hot.
I'm not pregnant. I'm hot. I'm too hot.
Right.
Right.
Aren't you?
Aren't you?
Sweltering. Come on, I'll take you home.
Sweltering. Come on, I'll take you home.
Can't we really go home? I can't breathe. Aren't you dying for green, anything green, or rain, wouldn't you die to feel rain on your face? It's Christmas and it's all - I don't know - if you asked me I'd go home tomorrow. If you wanted.

Sweetheart, you know we can't go home, there might be a war.

Geoffrey, you do so love putting on a disguise.
Geoffrey, you do so love putting on a disguise.
I do so love you. What do you smell of?
I do so love you. What do you smell of?
What?
What?
Marzipan! I think you've got marzipan in your hair. No wonder you're homesick.
Marvelous plane. Did you look?
Isn't it? Wedding present from Katharine's parents. I'm calling it Rupert Bear. Hello. Geoffrey Clifton.
Isn't it? Wedding present from Katharine's parents. I'm calling it Rupert Bear. Hello. Geoffrey Clifton.
We can finally consign my old bird to the scrapheap. Almásy smiles and walks on towards the others.
I think you know all of us, except for Geoffrey and Katharine Clifton, who've recently come out from England.
Apprentices.
Apprentices.
This is Clive Fenelon-Barnes.
Of course. Well, we should all go out onto the terrace.
Oh no, really. She has her book.
Oh no, really. She has her book.
I won't hear of it. None of us will.
Good heavens, are you married, Madox?
Very much so. We are all, save my friend here.
And a special thank you to Geoffrey and Katharine, without whose fund raising heroics we should still be kicking our heels. They toast the Cliftons.
To arm-twisting.
To arm-twisting.
Did Katharine say? - Geoffrey has to fly back to Cairo.
Did Katharine say? - Geoffrey has to fly back to Cairo.
Have to return the favor - take a few photographs for the army.
There was a Prince, who was dying, and he was carried up the tower at Pisa so he could die with a view of the Tuscan Hills. Am I that Prince? Hana laughs.
Because you're leaning? No, you're just on an angle. You're too heavy!
What was all the banging? Were you fighting rats or the entire German army?
I was repairing the stairs. I found a library and the books were very useful.
Before you find too many uses for these books would you read some to me?
I think they're all in Italian, but I'll look, yes. What about your own book?
I think they're all in Italian, but I'll look, yes. What about your own book?
My book? The Herodotus? Yes, we can read him.
Oh - I've found plums. We have plums in the orchard. We have an orchard! She has peeled a plum and now slips it into his mouth.
Thank you.
I will hide you in the room where we sleep, said Candaules. She stumbles over the word.
Candaules
Candaules
Candaules you're laughing at me.
Candaules you're laughing at me.
I'm not laughing at you. Go on, please.
I'm not laughing at you. Go on, please.
When my wife comes to lie down she always lays her garments one by one on a seat near the entrance of the room, and from where you stand you will be able to gaze on her at your leisure
Are you asleep?
Yes. Dropping off.
I should try and move your bed. I want you to be able to see the view. It's good, it's a view from a monastery.
I can already see.
I can already see.
How? How can you see anything?
How? How can you see anything?
Not the window - I can't bear the light anyway - no, I can see all the way to the desert. I've found the lost fossils.
Not the window - I can't bear the light anyway - no, I can see all the way to the desert. I've found the lost fossils.
I'm turning you.
Zerzura, the White City of Acacias, the Oasis of Little Birds. As me about the scent of acacia - it's in this room. I can smell it. The taste of tea so black it falls into your mouth. I can taste it. I'm chewing the mint. Is there sand in my eyes? Are you cleaning sand from my ears?
No sand. That's your drugs speaking.
No sand. That's your drugs speaking.
I can see my wife in that view.
I can see my wife in that view.
Are you remembering more?

Could I have a cigarette?
Could I have a cigarette?
Are you crazy?
Are you crazy?
Why are you so determined to keep me alive?
Why are you so determined to keep me alive?
Because I'm a nurse.
There's a man downstairs. He brought us eggs. He might stay.
Why? Can he lay eggs?
Why? Can he lay eggs?
He's Canadian.
He's Canadian.
Why are people always so happy when they collide with someone from the same place? What happened in Montreal when you passed a man in the street - did you invite him to live with you?

He needn't disturb you.
He needn't disturb you.
Me? He can't. I'm already disturbed.
Me? He can't. I'm already disturbed.
He won't disturb us then. I think he's after morphine. There's a war. Where you come from becomes important. And besides - we're vulnerable here. I keep hearing noises in the night. Voices.
Excuse me -
Yes?
Yes?
Can I ask - my friend, can he come in? Just for a few minutes?
Can I ask - my friend, can he come in? Just for a few minutes?
Your friend?
Your friend?
He's going back to the front this evening. I can't see him otherwise.
He's going back to the front this evening. I can't see him otherwise.
Just go off. I'll be quite all right.
Just go off. I'll be quite all right.
No, I can't go, but if it, if you weren't offended, it would be very good of you to allow us - every other cabin is crammed. This is as private as we'll get.
No, I can't go, but if it, if you weren't offended, it would be very good of you to allow us - every other cabin is crammed. This is as private as we'll get.
Well then - yes. Of course.
Well then - yes. Of course.
Thank you. Thank you.
This is Captain McGann.
Please, don't waste your time on pleasantries -
Something smells so rich. My stomach is heaving -
He came back, he says he caught a rabbit. I'm cooking it.
He came back, he says he caught a rabbit. I'm cooking it.
That's a different dress.
That's a different dress.
He keeps asking me questions about you. Do you know him? Do you recognize him?
He keeps asking me questions about you. Do you know him? Do you recognize him?
Do I recognize him? I recognize what he is. I like him. He's Canadian. He can read Italian. He can catch rabbits.
Could I ask you to move? I'm sorry - but when you turn, the sheets, I can't really bear the sheets moving over me. Sorry.
Yes, of course, I'm so sorry. Stupid of me. Hana gets up, upset to have hurt him.
Tell me about this, this is in your handwriting - December 22nd - Betrayals in war are childlike compared with our betrayals during peace. New lovers are nervous and tender, but smash everything - for the heart is an organ of fire I love that, I believe that. Who is K?
K is for Katharine.
He wants us to move out, says there could be fifty more mines in the building. He thinks I'm mad because I laughed at him. He's Indian, he wears a turban.
Sikh. If he wears a turban, he's a Sikh.
I'll probably marry him.
Really? That's sudden.
Really? That's sudden.
My mother always told me I would summon my husband by playing the piano.
I liked it better when there were just the two of us.
Why? Is he staying?
Why? Is he staying?
With his Sergeant. A Mr. Hardy.
With his Sergeant. A Mr. Hardy.
We should charge! Doesn't anyone have a job to do?
We should charge! Doesn't anyone have a job to do?
They have to clear all the local roads of mines. That's a big job. They won't stay in the house. They're putting up their tent in the garden.
They have to clear all the local roads of mines. That's a big job. They won't stay in the house. They're putting up their tent in the garden.
In that case, I suppose we can't charge.
Good morning. Did you know that? You're always singing?
I've been told that before.
I've been told that before.
Kip's another one.
Arguing about books.
Condensed milk - one of the truly great inventions.
You like him, don't you? Your voice changes.
I don't think it does. Anyway, he's indifferent to me.
I don't think it does. Anyway, he's indifferent to me.
I don't think it's indifference.
Hana was just telling me that you were indifferent -
Hey! -
Hey! -
- to her cooking.
I'm still here.
You'd better be.
You'd better be.
Don't depend on it. Will you? That little bit of air, each day there's less of it, which is al right, which is quite all right.
Why don't you go? You should sleep.
Would you like me to?
Who knows the Bosphorus Hug?
Never heard of it.
Never heard of it.
That was a dance we invented at the International Sand Club.
There's meant to be lace in the next village - the boys are taking me.
I'm not sewing anything else.
I'm not sewing anything else.
You don't have any money, do you? Just in case there's silk.
You don't have any money, do you? Just in case there's silk.
No!
No!
Hana, I know you do!
I'm not sewing anything else for you!
I love you.
Where's your Stuart from? Somewhere near there, isn't it?

Excuse me. Yes? I don't have the key to that door.
The Germans were here. The Germans were all over this area. They left mines everywhere. Pianos were their favorite hiding places.

I see. Then may be you're safe as long as you only play Bach. He's German. Kip is looking around the piano. Hana giggles.

Is something funny?
Is something funny?
No, but, no, not at all. I'm sorry. You came to the doors, that's all and - - such good manners for someone worried about mines. That's all.
No, but, no, not at all. I'm sorry. You came to the doors, that's all and - - such good manners for someone worried about mines. That's all.
I've met you before.
I've met you before.
I don't think so.
Try this. I found a great jar of it. Olive oil. In Naples this was so precious it would have bought you a wife.
Thank you.
For my hair?
Yes, for your hair.
I'll get another tin. Hana and the Patient are alone.
I didn't like that book either. It's all about men. Too many men. Just like this house.
It's okay - I'll help. Please.
The mines, the wires, there's a trick. Some explode if you stretch the wires, some if you cut them.
The mines, the wires, there's a trick. Some explode if you stretch the wires, some if you cut them.
What do I do?
What do I do?
There's a mine here, but the others are far enough away, I think at least to give me a chance. I have to work out which one to cut before I fall over.

So I follow the wires?

You get Hardy.
You get Hardy.
I follow the wires.
Why would anyone do this?
I've done this. I've had to do this.
What is this business with you and explosives? Do you think you're immune?
I promise you that was the right thing to do. He's my good luck. Now cut. This one. I hope we don't die.
I promise you that was the right thing to do. He's my good luck. Now cut. This one. I hope we don't die.
Okay. Get away from here. Quick.
Okay. Get away from here. Quick.
I'm not scared. So many people have died around me. But I would be a shame for us. I don't feel like being shy.
I'm not scared. So many people have died around me. But I would be a shame for us. I don't feel like being shy.
You must get away. Before I cut. I'm not cutting if you're here. He's struggling. He's going to topple over if he cuts.
You must get away. Before I cut. I'm not cutting if you're here. He's struggling. He's going to topple over if he cuts.
Actually, you can't cut, can you? You'll fall over. Give me the pliers.
Actually, you can't cut, can you? You'll fall over. Give me the pliers.
No. But he hands them over.
No. But he hands them over.
Kiss me. Before I cut. Just in case.
Kiss me. Before I cut. Just in case.
Don't talk. Check again. Lie flat and then cut.
Don't go. I'm frightened. I can love a coward, I can't love another dead man.
This is what I do. I do this every day.
Kip - come and dance with me
Yes. Later.
I was thinking yesterday - yesterday! - the Patient, Hardy: they're everything that's good about England. I couldn't even say what that was. We didn't exchange two personal words, and we've been together through some terrible things, some - he was engaged to a girl in the village! - I mean - and us - he never once He didn't ask me if I
You loved him.
If one night I didn't come to the tent, what would you do?
I try not to expect you.
I try not to expect you.
But if it got late and I hadn't shown up?
But if it got late and I hadn't shown up?
Then I'd think there must be a reason.
Then I'd think there must be a reason.
You wouldn't come to find me? That makes me never want to come here. But she continues unraveling the turban.
What are you up to?
That gun at Lahor, Kipling's cannon - Zamzammah - remember? That was made out of the metal of ordinary things. I want to make an ordinary thing out of guns. His bayonet is thrust into the forge. It's red hot.

When I went to England I was amazed at what went on, the waste - I'd been taught to re-use everything, the dung from a cow to cool a radiator, a fork to fix a typewriter - India could live for a hundred years on what I saw thrown away.

I should go to the house, get breakfast.
I should go to the house, get breakfast.
The lamp was burning all night in his room. Caravaggio was there with him.
This is hot!
Nya-nya-nya!
Will you come with me?
Of course. When?
Of course. When?
I mean home. India.
I mean home. India.
Kip I -
Kip I -
I know - here I am always a brown man, there you would be always a white woman.
I know - here I am always a brown man, there you would be always a white woman.
Is that what you think? Is that what you think I think?
Is that what you think? Is that what you think I think?
It's what I've learned.
It's what I've learned.
I'm thinking about your heart, not your skin. And how to reach it. And that I don't think I can. A bomb has ruined us, just not the bomb I thought would ruin us.
I've clung to you. I've clung to you. Kip. Life a raft.
Then come with me.
I'll always go back to that church. Look at my painting.
I'll always go back to that church.
I'll always go back to that church.
So one day we'll meet.
The war's over - you told me yourself. How can it be desertion?
It's not over everywhere. I didn't mean literally.
It's not over everywhere. I didn't mean literally.
When he dies I'll catch up.
It's not safe here. The whole country's crawling with Bandits and Germans and God knows what. It's madness. I can't allow it. You're not, this is natural - it's shock. For all of us. Hana -
I need morphine. A lot. And a pistol.
I need morphine. A lot. And a pistol.
And what if he really is a spy?
And what if he really is a spy?
He can't even move.
He can't even move.
If anything happened to you I'd never forgive myself.
Why Picton?
He's from there - edge of Lake Ontario right, Soldier?
Third Canadian Fusiliers.
Does he know a Captain McGann? The boy hears this, whispers to Oliver.
He's gone, hasn't he?
No. He's - no.
No. He's - no.
Oh God. Oh God.
Hello.
Hello miss.

You saved my life. I haven't forgotten. I thought you were very very tall. You seemed to big - a Giant - and I felt like a child who can't keep her balance.

I was looking for the Lieutenant Singh.
He's sleeping.

Only we have to go to work.

I'll tell him. What is it? Is it a mine?

Pardon me?
Pardon me?
What if you couldn't find him ? Sergeant, not today, please. Not this morning.
Whoa - give me a chance!
Sorry. I took a Benzedrine.
I've got a surprise. A boat! We can go to Capri. It's got a cabin, it's private.
I'd like to spend a night with you in a bed.

We can do that when we're very, very old.
You've got a mustache.
A bit of one.

I was looking forward to this evening.

Hey! Hey! Stop! Hey!
Don't move! Stand ABSOLUTELY STILL! Hana stops.
What's happening? Am I needed?
I'm afraid so, sir. Kip hurries to his tent. Hana follows him.
You've got to cut, sir, that frost won't last.
Go away.
Go away.
Yessir.
Yessir.
This is making me incredibly angry.
Your book. Your Herodotus! Almásy looks uncomfortable.
It doesn't matter. Really. I think I can muddle through. Okay - The Story of Candaules and Gyges. King Candaules was passionately in love with his wife - One day he said to Gyges, the son of somebody, anyway - his favorite warrior -
Mrs. Clifton, you'll have to forgive us. We're not accustomed to the company of women.
Not at all. I was thoroughly enjoying by book. Please. Signor D'Agostino, Herr Bermann.
I'm afraid we're not having much luck obtaining funds for the expedition.
How awful. What will you do?
How awful. What will you do?
A more modest expedition, or even wait a year. Remind our families we still exist.
Darling, Peter says I could stay
Why not?
Certainly not.
I insist. There clearly isn't room for us all, I'm the least able to dig, and I'm not one of the walking wounded. Those are facts. Besides, if I remain it's the most effective method of persuading my husband to abandon whatever he's doing and rescue us. It's hard to argue with this logic.
Katharine!
Coming. I can't sleep. I woke up shouting in the middle of the night. Geoffrey thinks it's the thing in the desert, the trauma.
You should sit down, darling. She's quite all right. Are you pregnant?
I don't think so.
I don't think so.
How romantic. With Fiona I fell over every five minutes. Ronnie Christened me Lady Downfall.

I'll come with you.

No, please. I shall be absolutely fine. They pass Almásy, who doesn't look up from his book.

It's still there, the cannon, outside the museum. It was made of metal cups and bowls taken from every household in the city as tax, then melted down. Then later they fired the cannon at my people - comma - The natives.

So what do you really object to - the writer or what he's writing about?
So what do you really object to - the writer or what he's writing about?
What I really object to, Uncle, is your finishing all my condensed milk. And the message everywhere in your book - however slowly I read it - that the best destiny for India is to be ruled by the British.

Hana, we have discovered a shared please - the boy and I.
This is wonderful!
What's he saying?
Kip?
I looked up to you, Uncle. My brother always said I was a fool. Never trust the British, he said: the deal-makers, the map-makers; never shake hands with them.

What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
What have I been doing all this time? Do you know how many mines I've seen? - more mines than there are soldiers, more - how many mines we've put in the ground ourselves, stuffed in corpses, dropped out of the sky. And now this.
They're excited! They're happy about destroying a whole city. Would they do that to a White Man's City? Never!
Go on, do it. I don't need to hear any more.
What about your rank or serial number?
No. I think I was a pilot. I was found near the wreckage of a plane by the Bedouin. I was with them for some time.
Am I being interrogated? You should be trying to trick me. Ask me about Tottenham Hotspur. Or Buckingham Palace. About Marmite - I was addicted. Or make me speak German, which I can, by the way.
Why? Are you German?
Why? Are you German?
No.
No.
How do you know you're not German if you don't remember anything?
How do you know you're not German if you don't remember anything?
You tell me. I remember a lot of things. I remember a garden, plunging down to the sea - the Devil's Chimney we called it - and there was a cottage at the bottom, right on the shore, nothing between you and France.

Then you were married?

I think so. Although I believe that to be true of a number of Germans. Might I have a glass of water?
Where were you? I called at 4:30 this morning.
There are times when you don't answer the phone.
You didn't answer the beeper either.

A thief this good could handle the sensors in the rooms. What we don't get is how he effectuated his entry.
Through a window.
Through a window.
The windows don't open.
The windows don't open.
Entry through the doors or vents triggers instant alarm.
So he popped the pane?
Bingo.
That's great if you're a computer. In the real world that pane weighs 200 pounds. The building's 600 feet high.
He unscrewed the bolts, reset them on rollers, then slid the whole frame away. No more effort than it takes to vacuum a floor.

Interesting theory. Where's the proof?
You ordering chop suey again?
Let a thousand flowers bloom. Chairman Mao.
Meaning--
Meaning no one arranges calalilies like that. He left the window open when he came in. His only mistake.
And the draft blew over the flowers.
Put the bolts on that window under a scope, I'm betting you'll find wrench scratches on them.
Mac's signature.
Give me a break. Remember Manzini? When he stole Montezuma's scepter he left a Pepto Bismal bottle. The best ones always copy Mac.

You're saying the thief wants us to think it's Mac but it's really not.

Exactly.
They've never caught him before, what makes you think they'll catch him now?
You got a better idea?
You got a better idea?
Yeah. Me.
We've got to catch him in the act.
Why didn't I think of that?
Why didn't I think of that?
It's not the thinking of it, it's the doing it.
It's not the thinking of it, it's the doing it.
With that computer--nobody better. Out there...it's different. You twisted your ankle stepping over a curb on Madison Avenue.
I've been following this guy for years. I'm your best shot.
How would you approach him? Hello, Mr. MacDougal, I'm Gin, would you steal a painting with me?
How would you approach him? Hello, Mr. MacDougal, I'm Gin, would you steal a painting with me?
I'd need an introduction. From someone he trusts. Someone who owes us a favor.
That's doable.
And a target guaranteed to catch his interest.

Which you have in mind.

I'm going to get him, I promise you.
I have a question...
Who am I?
Who am I?
That is of no interest.
Why are we speaking Chinese?
Uh. I'm showing off.
Uh. I'm showing off.
A billion people speak Chinese. Don't be too impressed with yourself. As for that scroll, I can resell it for double. In 30 minutes.

No you can't.
No you can't.
I can't?
I can't?
It's sold.
How about if I try humility.
How about if you try disappearing.
Mr. MacDougal.
You're like malaria. Once you get it, you can't get rid of it.
I'm sorry about the scroll, but sometimes you have to lose to win.
Where did you hear that, one of those American talk shows? Check, please.

I don't want to waste your time.
I don't want to waste your time.
Then don't.
Then don't.
I have a proposal for you.
Believe me, if you weren't so tiresome, I'd have one for you.
Something of great value, something of such artistic and historic significance that only you could truly appreciate...
You have a car?
Uh, yes.
Uh, yes.
Meet me in front. Five minutes.
Seems I am.
I'll call an ambulance.
I'll call an ambulance.
It's nothing serious. I'll just run into that building. They'll have some sort of first aid kit.
You disappeared.
You seemed to be handling everything quite nicely.

Are you...okay?
Are you...okay?
It was only a scratch. Far more damaging to my trousers than to me.
It was only a scratch. Far more damaging to my trousers than to me.
That's good. Terrific.
I don't care about the damned car. My luggage's been stolen.
You're joking. You can't trust anyone these days.
Yes. But they don't have a clue. Why would anyone steal my luggage?
Maybe the thief thought you had something valuable. You are in the business, that's what Roki says.

Like I would have art in my suitcase.

Of course you wouldn't. The Rembrandt wouldn't fit.
Of course you wouldn't. The Rembrandt wouldn't fit.
Excuse me?
I've got something...
I sincerely hope so.
You're not taking me seriously.
Oh, I'm taking you...quite seriously.
I didn't expect you to be so...
So what?
So what?
So alive.
Do you mind?
You...you can't.
You...you can't.
Of course I can. I have a note from mother.
You're shaking. Are you nervous?
No. Why would I be?
No. Why would I be?
Because you young Americans think the world began when you were born. You fall apart when you don't get your own way.
I've got something for you.
Oh, that's quite all right. No charge.
And I thought we were getting on so well.
We were, we are, but this is perfect for you.
We were, we are, but this is perfect for you.
Not interested.
Are you under the impression that now I'm in some way obligated to you?
Well, no...but...
Well, no...but...
Good. I'll call the concierge. They can get you a new room, book your flight home, so forth.
For God's sake.
I'm sorry. This just means so much to me.
The Empress Death Mask.
The most important piece of Chinese art outside of China.
Somewhat better than that temple scroll you were bidding on.
That old pirate Chiang Kai Shek personally took this to Taiwan when he was run out of China in 1949. Peking would dearly love to have this back...

It's not for sale.
I know.
So you've heard all those stories about me. Well, I can assure you they're not true. And if they were true, I've retired.
But Roki said--
Roki has a vivid imagination.

Besides, if I lacked certain ethical scruples about the ownership of property--which I do not--I wouldn't need a partner, much less a callow girl. I'd do it myself.

It's only on exhibit at the Queen's Museum this month. Even if you could get into the museum, the Mask bas its own security system. A special, randomly programmed interval code.
We going somewhere?
Possibly.
Possibly.
Maybe I should drive this time.
Maybe I should drive this time.
Maybe you should go buy yourself some clothes.
Very nice.
Not a word.
You want me to pick up a painting?
Quite a good one. A Monet. Not major, but it is Giverney.
Quite a good one. A Monet. Not major, but it is Giverney.
I'm not here to run errands. I'm here for the Mask.
I'm not here to run errands. I'm here for the Mask.
If I can't trust you to pick up a painting, how can I trust you about the Mask?
It's a test.
That's my girl.
Fine. What do I do?
It's simple. You pick up the painting, you pay for it with this debit card.
How much am I paying?
I'm paying...one point five million and change. I hate round numbers.
It's a fake.
Give him the card.
Give him the card.
But--
But--
Can you follow simple directions?
I'm telling you it's a forgery. The paint's still wet for God's sake.
Look on the back. What do you see?
A film case.
That's what you're buying. Put it in your pocket.
He says they turned the card down.
Damn, I knew I forgot something.
Damn, I knew I forgot something.
Not funny.
What the hell do I do now?
Up to you. You could tell him the check is in the mail.
What the hell was that?
Not bad. I didn't expect you to make it out.
Not bad. I didn't expect you to make it out.
You what--?
Motorcycle.
Got it.
It's one way.
We're only going one way.
We're going to die, aren't we...
I'm not the one to ask...
What about your bags?
I never carry...baggage.
Those are my clothes.
Certainly not mine. Come on.
You stole my luggage? You--
I'm a thief. Sue me.
I'm a thief. Sue me.
Where's my bag?
That's entrapment.
No. Entrapment is what cops do to robbers.
I don't believe this.
What's your problem? I'm doing the job.
What's your problem? I'm doing the job.
What's my problem? You want a list?
What's my problem? You want a list?
You really don't believe I'd take on a partner after all these years without a little...insurance?
Lose something?
I'm just curious what sort of security system you'd have in your own house.

And--
And--
I'm impressed. Can't spot a thing.
I'm impressed. Can't spot a thing.
Hmmm. I'd be surprised if you could.
Nothing? You don't even lock the door?
I guess I have a more optimistic view of human nature than you do.
Why are we in separate--you know, separate rooms?
My job, my rules. We've got a job to do. No mixing business and pleasure.
You're late.
<u>I'm</u> dressed.
And good morning.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Nice spot.
Nice spot.
It is. Coffee and fruitloops or whatever you eat in the kitchen. We'll start in twenty minutes.
I know it well.
As I recall, you've robbed it before.

In a week.
Only a week?
They're having a farewell party the last night. Before the Mask goes back to Taiwan.
They're having a farewell party the last night. Before the Mask goes back to Taiwan.
That's when we'll do it. And we'll need every single day.
So the Duke dug a tunnel--just in case. They made the lake a hundred years later. Flooded the tunnel.
We go underwater?
We? Are you implying that I'm taking you inside?
We're doing this together. We're partners.
We're doing this together. We're partners.
Precisely. You give me the Mask security code, I steal the Mask, you get a finders fee. At ten percent, should be two or three million at least. Not too bad.
I go in alone.
You don't get the Mask code unless I go.
Pack up. I'll see you get back to London.
Look, I can help. You need a sensor expert. You've got one.
Look, I can help. You need a sensor expert. You've got one.
This isn't some Picasso print you steal out of a car dealer's rec room.
You don't have any idea how lucky you are!
A lifelong problem, I'm afraid.
A lifelong problem, I'm afraid.
No, dammit! I mean me! That Rembrandt...that Rembrandt!
Nice try. Everyone thinks I did.
That's because I wanted them to!
That's because I wanted them to!
I wondered who'd been giving me a bad name.

I drilled the bolts and went in through the window. It was the only way to bypass the smart glass.
I drilled the bolts and went in through the window. It was the only way to bypass the smart glass.
True enough.
True enough.
You need a partner for this job. You'll never find one as good as me.
The Rembrandt--that was quite good.
It was perfect.
Someone was expecting that.
You're too easily impressed with yourself. I believe I've made that point before.
I'll need that.
No one <u>needs</u> anything except food and shelter. The rest we just want.
No one <u>needs</u> anything except food and shelter. The rest we just want.
This isn't a good time to hear your personal philosophy.
Don't worry, I can get rid of this. No trace. And I'll even go fifty fifty, we're partners aren't we?
No. It's a down payment.
On what? Another job?
We get the Mask I'll tell you.
We get the Mask I'll tell you.
A partner with secrets isn't much of a partner.
A partner with secrets isn't much of a partner.
Without the Mask it doesn't matter.
Without the Mask it doesn't matter.
So the Mask is part of the down payment too. Must be a really big job.
So the Mask is part of the down payment too. Must be a really big job.
Let's just see how we do.
So you're testing <u>me</u> now?
Oh, I think you can do it. Probably.
Why don't we take oxygen?
We are...for the tools.
Let's do it again.
Try laps. Say a hundred.
Did I hear a car?
Our equipment has arrived.
Our equipment has arrived.
Hmmm.
All this, this is a woman's version of what you would like.
It was a long time ago.
I didn't mean to get personal.
Yes you did.
So how long to pop the floor?
Twenty four seconds--as long as it takes the clock to strike twelve.

The lipstick thermal camera?
Got it.
Charged?
Charged?
Charged. Receiver?
That's it. We're ready.
One more item--not on the check list.
I trust it's your size.
It's---beautiful.
You bought this for me?
Don't get any ideas. Of course it comes out of your share.
Thank you.
Thank you.
No, no, I want to. I'll just go into the village.
It's not a village. There's nothing there.
Won't take any time.
Straight down the drive, right at the hedgerow, follow the lane. Don't blink, you'll miss it.
Certainly the most beautiful crook I've ever seen.
I've got something for you.
Aren't we early?
Little celebration before we set off.
To us. To the Mask.
To our...partnership.
You're nervous again.
When I was a girl my father took me to the edge of El Capitan. Three thousand feet of granite. Straight down. I was so scared my mouth was full of cotton. I couldn't talk, just stood there shivering...like this.

Terrified. Still am.

I had a lifeline. If I've got a lifeline, I'm okay.
I had a lifeline. If I've got a lifeline, I'm okay.
Aren't we all.
Aren't we all.
My father told me not to be afraid. He'd always be there for me.
He wasn't.
So you had to be your own lifeline.
So you had to be your own lifeline.
Something like that.
And--
He pulled back his arms and blam, I landed right on the floor. I picked myself up, tears in my eyes, and he looked at me and he said, Son, don't ever trust anybody. Anybody.

In eye of that painting.
We're working.
It's a party.
It's a party.
Let's mingle a little, shall we?
One, two, three...
You're not on the beat.
Don't turn. I'm counting the steps to the entrance.
These rooms are solid stone. They haven't changed.

You can't be too careful.
You can't be too careful.
Yes, you can. You can spoil a perfectly nice dance.
Ready?
Ready.
Can you see the other PIRs?
Got it.
They moved it.
Behind you.
Be careful not to break the laser beams.
Duh.
Careful...careful.
Shut up.
We did it.
The Mask.
Now's when you tell me who you really are.
What?
You're playing both sides of the street. You're going to keep the Mask and turn me in.
No, no, please God, you're wrong. I'm a thief. Just like you.
Okay, you're a thief.
Yes. Yes.
Yes. Yes.
What do I need a thief for? I've got the Mask.
STOP! You're making...mistake.
It's your mistake.
It's your mistake.
The big job.
The big job.
There is no big job.
What?
A billion dollars.
Your share.
Get the hell in.
We're living history here.
You don't know the half of it.
I like banks. That's where the money is.
Speaking of money. You said billions. How many?
If you want a partner, I think you should recalculate the split.
Okay, 80-20--
No, really, it's your plan, you should get at least 30 per cent--
My eighty, your twenty, smart guy--
My eighty, your twenty, smart guy--
It's fifty-fifty, less the cost of the dress.
Come on, what can you do with six billion you can't do with four?
Hold the record. Alone.
Hmmm...44 long.
I always knew you'd do the job.
You've got everything planned.
Everything.
I'll need the Rembrandt now.
Sure, it's only worth 25 million or so, don't bother telling me what you're going to do with it.
Sure, it's only worth 25 million or so, don't bother telling me what you're going to do with it.
I told you. It's the down payment. And thanks to you it's overdue.
Insidious thing, wondering if your partner...has another partner.
Okay, look, I'm delivering this to a man who's going to give us the key to our job. But it's pointless to try to explain it yet. You just have to trust me. I don't have any more secrets.

Everyone has secrets, it's what makes us human.
Idle hands, the devil's workshop.
There's food in the fridge. I won't be long.
The Mask. Where is it?
You took the Rembrandt, I figured it was a fair trade.
Do you know what you've done!? Do you know?

Oh my god, I thought--
I'd taken the Mask?
What about the rules?
My job, my rules.
Well...What are we doing?
You're being useless. I'm making us rich.
Currency data so we can do optimum conversions at the moment of transfer.
Transfer.

The eight billion. From them to us.

Right. The eight billion.

Guest lists of every A-list party on turnover night. They'd be handy to disappear into, so we're invited to all of them.
Peoples China Bank.
Where the money is.
It's taken me five years at Webber Insurance, nights, weekends, every spare minute, to make this CD. It has all the necessary instructions and confirmation codes to tell their computer to transfer reasonably modest sums out of thousands of those accounts, two, or three million at a crack. Total, eight billion and change.
And the money goes--

Every wire transfer gets rocketed through a series of multiple switches. As soon as each deposit lands somewhere, it's shot somewhere else. It ends up so clean the Mafia couldn't find it.

See you.
Probably not.

You're kidding, right? Look at these readings for Christ's sake. PG&E's own technicians documented toxic levels of hexavalent chromium in those test wells, on numerous occasions.
A million things could have caused those problems. Poor diet, bad genes, irresponsible lifestyle. Our offer is final and more than fair.
Wait a minute -- I thought we were negotiating here.

250,000 is all I'm authorized to offer.

Well it oughta be, with all the work I put into it.
I added air conditioning, put in the pool, made all those pillows by hand ...
Yeah? I should learn to do stuff like that. They make the place feel real homey.
Thank you. I think so too. That's why I'm being such a stickler on this house price thing. I don't mean to be a pain in PG&E's backside, especially after all they've done for Hinkley, but I look around here and I think, if they want this place, they're gonna have to pay for it. And I don't just mean pay for the house;
Right.
Right.
Cause first you gotta move, then there's decorating, and if the windows aren't the same size, you know -- you're making all new curtains. Honest to God, I don't know if I have the energy. You know, I've been sick. Me and Peter both have.

Yeah, I'm real glad you brought that up. I was going through your file here, and I ran into these medical records. They kinda surprised me --
I know. They're more than a bit unusual. See, two years ago, Pete got Hodgkin's disease. That's a kind of cancer --
Yeah, I'm real sorry to hear that.
Yeah, I'm real sorry to hear that.
Thank you. It's in remission now, thank the Lord, but you never know. And then while that's going on, I end up having to have a hysterectomy. Plus a whole mess of lumps removed from my breasts. All benign so far, but still, no matter how positive you stay, an operation can still take it out of you.

Yeah, I can see that. I guess the only thing that confused me is - - not that your medical problems aren't important, but -- how come the files about them are in with all the real estate stuff?
Are you kidding? With how our lives are, if I start subdividing files, I'll be sunk. I just kept all PG&E correspondence in one place.
Right, but -- I'm sorry, I don't see why you were corresponding with PG&E about it in the first place.

Not around here. This is a rough part of the world. Hard times, not a lot of money, not a lot of luck. It's a challenge, staying healthy in a town like this. Heck, even our dogs up and die.

Well -- then it's gotta be a different than what's in our water, cause ours is okay. The guys from PG&E told me. They sat right in the kitchen and said it was fine.
I know. But the toxicologist I been talking to? He gave me a list of problems that can come from hexavalent chromium exposure. And everything you all have is on that list.
No. Hunh-uh, see, that's not what the doctor said. He said one's got absolutely nothing to do with the other.
Right, but -- didn't you say he was paid by PG&E?
Sure wish I had longer to get used to the idea. You think if you got no uterus, and no breasts, you're still technically a woman?
Sure you are. You're just a happier woman, cause you don't have to deal with maxi-pads and underwire.
You wouldn't happen to have a little time right now, would you, Donna?
For what?
For what?
Well, I was gonna head over to the Browns now. I was thinking -- Mandy really values your opinion ...

You said things would be fine, and they're not.
You said things would be fine, and they're not.
I'm sorry about that. Really. But --
I'm sorry about that. Really. But --
I don't need pity. I need a paycheck. And I've looked, but when you've spent the last six years raising babies, it's real hard to convince someone to give you a job that pays worth a damn. So I figure, since you're the one who said I was gonna be okay, you should be the one to hire me.
Okay, look. If you really want to apply for a job here, you can do it the way everyone else does. Send in a rÈsumÈ, make an --
I'm <u>not</u> everyone else, Mr. Masry. I'm someone you made promises to that you didn't deliver on. I trusted you. With my kids' well-being. Now, I'm smart, and I'm hard- working, and I'll do anything. But if you think I'm leaving here without a job, you got another thing coming.
Yeah?
I was wondering -- could you tell me who I'd talk to about maybe getting an advance on my paycheck? Just -- for the weekend.

Oh. Okay. That's okay.
All I have is hundreds.
I don't wanna take your money, Mr. Masry.
I don't wanna take your money, Mr. Masry.
Bullshit, you don't.
Give her a cold washcloth to suck on -- I gotta go -- there's a clean one in that bag -- I'll check back in a bit. Sorry. My kid --
Where's Anna?
Where's Anna?
Out to lunch with the girls.
Out to lunch with the girls.
Oh. Huh. Well, look, I got this file I need valued. Real estate thing. A lady has some property next to a PG&E plant that PG&E wants to buy. I need to know what to ask for it.
You do know how to do that, don't you?
Yeah. I got it. No problem.
Yeah. I got it. No problem.
Good.
You're a girl.
Excuse me?
Excuse me?
How come you're not at lunch with the girls? You're a girl.
How come you're not at lunch with the girls? You're a girl.
I guess I'm not the right kind.
Erin, you've been gone for a week.
I left a message. I've been dealing with that real estate thing. I was gonna write up a whole damn report and --
I left a message. I've been dealing with that real estate thing. I was gonna write up a whole damn report and --
That's not how we work here. You don't just leave a message and take off.
Okay, enough -- Now, look, Erin -- this incident aside, I don't think this is the right place for you. So what I'm gonna do is make a few calls on your behalf. Find you something else, okay?
Don't bother.
Come on, I'm trying to help here.
Bullshit. You're trying to feel less guilty about firing someone with three kids to feed. Fuck if I'll help you do that.
What are you doing here?
I got an interesting call this afternoon. It was from a Dr. Frankel.
I got an interesting call this afternoon. It was from a Dr. Frankel.
Oh, yeah?
Oh, yeah?
He wanted you to know the legal limit for hexavalent chromium, is .05 parts per million. And that at the rate you mentioned, .58, it could be responsible for the cancers in that family you asked about. The Irvings.

Well, that was nice of him. Isn't it funny how some people go out of their way to help people and others just give 'em the ax?
Well, that was nice of him. Isn't it funny how some people go out of their way to help people and others just give 'em the ax?
Look, I'm sorry. You were gone. I just assumed you were off having fun.
Look, I'm sorry. You were gone. I just assumed you were off having fun.
Now, why in the hell would you assume that?
Now, why in the hell would you assume that?
I don't know. Maybe cause you look like someone who has a lot of fun.
I don't know. Maybe cause you look like someone who has a lot of fun.
Boy, are you ever a shitty judge of people.
So what's the story on this thing? This cancer stuff?
You wanna know, you gotta hire me back. I got a lot of bills to pay.
But, PG&E told her about the chromium?
They told her something, but it can't have been too specific, cause I talked to her, and she sure didn't think her water was bad.

I didn't see any medical records in there.
I didn't see any medical records in there.
Boy, you musta really fine-tooth-combed it then, huh? And <u>you</u> fired <u>me</u>. Jesus.
That document you found, the one that says it was the bad chromium -- you didn't happen to make a copy did you?
Course I did.
Course I did.
Lemme see it, will you?
I want a raise. And benefits. Including dental.
Look, Erin, this is not the way I do business, this extortion nonsense.
Okay. A 5% raise, and --
Ten. There's a lot of other places I could work.
Ten. There's a lot of other places I could work.
A ten percent raise and benefits. But that's it. I'm drawing the line.
This is the only thing you found?
So far. But that place is a pig sty. I wouldn't be surprised if there's more.
So far. But that place is a pig sty. I wouldn't be surprised if there's more.
Find out.
I'm telling you, the minute Brenda sent the fax -- I'm talking the second she pressed that send button -- PG&E claims department is on the phone to me, scheduling a meeting.
So you think we got 'em scared?
So you think we got 'em scared?
It sure as hell sounded like they were sitting up and taking notice.
At least they made an offer.
That wasn't an offer. A million would've been an offer. When they send the God damn mail clerk down to jerk me off, waste my time, it's a fuck you.
That wasn't an offer. A million would've been an offer. When they send the God damn mail clerk down to jerk me off, waste my time, it's a fuck you.
I don't get why they'd do that.
I don't get why they'd do that.
Because they can. You heard that kid -- they have 28 billion dollars at their disposal. They can afford to waste all the time in the world.
Because they can. You heard that kid -- they have 28 billion dollars at their disposal. They can afford to waste all the time in the world.
And you can't?
And you can't?
What, you think I'm made of money?
Mr. Masry, Mario gets lost going to the bathroom. They'll be driving around the valley for hours.
Yeah. Isn't that a shame?
Boy, do I know how you feel. First time I heard that number, I said you got to be kidding me. Forty God damn percent?
Erin --
Erin --
I'm the one who's injured, and this joker who sits at a desk all day is gonna walk away with almost half my reward?
I'm the one who's injured, and this joker who sits at a desk all day is gonna walk away with almost half my reward?
Erin --
Then I don't get anything either.
And I realized, he's taking a chance too.
Hunh-uh. Absolutely not.
That's crazy -- why not?
That's crazy -- why not?
Because I said no. Look -- the only reason PG&E's even talking to us is cause this is a quiet little real estate dispute. We add plaintiffs, and suddenly we're in the middle of a toxic tort -- with a statute problem -- against a massive utility. No, thank you.
Okay, so here's what I'll do. I'll go on up to Ted and Rita Daniels -- two of the nicest people you'd ever hope to meet, who spend every single day watching their little girl fight like a dog against this cancer -- I'll tell them we can't help them cause you don't feel like working that hard.
It's not about working hard --
It's not about working hard --
Bullshit.
Bullshit.
-- It's about being realistic. Something like this, Erin -- it could take forever. They're a huge corporation. They'd completely bury us in paperwork. I'm just one guy with a shitty little P.I. firm.
-- It's about being realistic. Something like this, Erin -- it could take forever. They're a huge corporation. They'd completely bury us in paperwork. I'm just one guy with a shitty little P.I. firm.
-- who happens to know they poisoned people and lied about it.
And this shit is bad news, Mr. Masry. Not only does it attack every organ of the body, it fucks with your DNA, too. That means these people's genes, and the genes of their kids, and the genes of their grandkids --
I know how DNA works, Erin --
We can get these people. With a little effort, I really think we can nail their asses to the wall.
Oh, you do? With all your legal expertise, you believe that?
Oh, you do? With all your legal expertise, you believe that?
Okay, fine. I don't know shit about shit. But I know the difference --
How many families we talking about here?
Four more. Eleven people. So far.
Four more. Eleven people. So far.
You think there's more?
You think there's more?
Well -- I found one document at the water board that had a toxic test well reading from 1967. A hell of a lot of people have lived on that land since then.
This is a whole different ball game, Erin. A much bigger deal.
Kinda like David and what's-his-name?
Kinda like David and what's-his-name?
Kinda like David and what's-his-name's whole fucking family. Okay, here's the deal -- if, and only if, you find me the evidence to back all this up -- I'll do it. I'll take it on.
You're doing the right thing, Mr. Masry.
Yeah, yeah. Remind me of that when I'm filing for bankruptcy.
What now?
Another raise wouldn't hurt. And with all the time I'm gonna be spending on the road, I'll probably be needing my own cel phone, won't I?
Is that what I think it is?
She lived on the plume. You never know.
You wanna talk about --
<u>No</u>.
They used the hex chrom here, in these cooling tanks, as an anti-corrosive. Then they dumped it here, in these six ponds.
I don't remember seeing any ponds up there.
They covered 'em over. And not too carefully either, cause you dig one inch under the surface, and the dirt is green as a fucking shamrock.
And that's what caused the contamination?
And that's what caused the contamination?
It didn't help, but no. The real problem's on the bottom.
See, according to this, they were supposed to line the ponds so this shit couldn't seep into the ground. But guess what --
They skipped that step.
They skipped that step.
I guess it was a little too inconvenient. So for fourteen years, this stuff flowed into the groundwater, free as you please.
I guess it was a little too inconvenient. So for fourteen years, this stuff flowed into the groundwater, free as you please.
Jesus. I don't even wanna ask what you did to make this Melendez guy talk.
For your information, Frank cares what was in those ponds 'cause he used to spend half his day wading around them. That was his job.
No shit.
No shit.
No --
Erin -- lemme tell you something. If I'da put three researchers on this, I wouldn't expect them to dig up all the information you got here. This is some damn good work.
Yeah? Then gimme another raise.
Yeah? Then gimme another raise.
Hey, I got a staff to pay, plus rent, plus I haven't billed a minute of my time since I started on this case, so you can quit hitting me up like I'm rich or something.
Don't give me that. You're gonna get plenty rich off of this, Mr. 40 percent. We got those PG&E fuckers by the balls here.
We've got the PG&E fuckers in Hinkley by the balls. But nobody's getting rich unless we can pin this on the corporate PG&E fuckers in San Francisco.
We've got the PG&E fuckers in Hinkley by the balls. But nobody's getting rich unless we can pin this on the corporate PG&E fuckers in San Francisco.
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
PG&E corporate is claiming they had no way of knowing what was going on in Hinkley.
PG&E corporate is claiming they had no way of knowing what was going on in Hinkley.
Oh, they knew. They had to know.
Oh, they knew. They had to know.
Show me the document that proves that.
Then they didn't know. And if they didn't know, we can't hit 'em for punitive damages. And punitive damages is where the money is.
Jesus Christ, Ed -- you know, the more I work on this thing, the more I realize what a crock of shit this legal system is. Here we got a company that poisoned a whole aquifer -- that built a pool for a town, then filled it with toxic water -- and <u>we're</u> the ones who've gotta bust our ass proving things? That's just
I like this case.
Really? It makes me sick.
Really? It makes me sick.
Me too. That's why I like it. It's been a long time since I had a case I cared about.
Me too. That's why I like it. It's been a long time since I had a case I cared about.
You didn't care about my case?
You didn't care about my case?
I would now.
Hey. I like working with you.
Well, good, Ed. I like working with you too.
If they've sent that little shmuck Baum again, I'm gonna be real pissed off.
From their tone of voice on the phone, I'd say they're taking us more seriously.
From their tone of voice on the phone, I'd say they're taking us more seriously.
Yeah, I heard that one before.
Jesus. They look like the Secret Service.
They're trying to intimidate us. Tell them to wait in the conference room.
Hey. A new plaintiff called, wants to meet you. I told him we'd be out there Thursday.
D'you get his name? Course not. Jesus, Ed --
D'you get his name? Course not. Jesus, Ed --
He said he'd be at the gas station at six.
He said he'd be at the gas station at six.
Boy, this job takes me to some of the best damn places, huh?
Someone's following me.
What? Who?
What? Who?
Some guy in a truck -- he waited till I was alone, then he followed me, like, two miles. Jesus, I'm shaking. Get me a beer.
What kind of truck?
I don't know. Big. Dark.
I don't know. Big. Dark.
He's gone. Did you get a license plate? Or a make?
He's gone. Did you get a license plate? Or a make?
No, Ed -- what with me running for my life, I didn't have time to check those things --
No, Ed -- what with me running for my life, I didn't have time to check those things --
I was just asking. Are you all right?
I was just asking. Are you all right?
Yeah. Yeah, I'm ... fine.
I want my fucking money --
I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to put you on hold for just one second here -- Do you mind?
I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to put you on hold for just one second here -- Do you mind?
Yeah, I mind. You bet your ass I mind.
Oh, Jesus. You wanna tell me what the problem is here, or --
It's my paycheck. Which I earned. Which I deserve. Which I shouldn't have to beg for. That fat-ass bitch won't give it to me.
It's my paycheck. Which I earned. Which I deserve. Which I shouldn't have to beg for. That fat-ass bitch won't give it to me.

Erin, you're a big girl. If you got a problem with Jane, work it out for yourself. I don't have time to deal with --
Fuck you. Make time. Cause I bust my ass for you. I watch everything else in my life go straight in the toilet, for you. And what do you do for me? Huh? You see the way I'm treated around here -- but have you ever stood up for me once? Have you ever mentioned to everyone what good work I'm doing? Have you

Is that what you want?
Is that what you want?
I want my paycheck. By the end of the day.
I'll see what I can do.
You might want to think real hard about the amount, too. My kids are sitting in the God damn parking lot right now, cause I still don't make enough to afford good child care. Makes me think about looking around for a job where I'm appreciated, for shit's sake.
What kind of things come up?
Things like the head counsel for PG&E calling me with an offer. 20 million, plus attorney's fees. Take it or leave it.

Do you think we'd do better by going to trial?
Do you think we'd do better by going to trial?
Maybe. but maybe not. We still don't have anything linking this to PG&E corporate. Plus, there's the statute problem. Plus, we're way short on manpower, so we'd need to bring on more lawyers ...
Maybe. but maybe not. We still don't have anything linking this to PG&E corporate. Plus, there's the statute problem. Plus, we're way short on manpower, so we'd need to bring on more lawyers ...
Plus, 40 percent of 20 million's a whole lot of money.
Plus, 40 percent of 20 million's a whole lot of money.
It's eight million dollars, Erin. Eight million dollars.
Holy shit. Who do they represent, God?
Don't joke. They might. So do me a favor and behave yourself for once. Ed Masry to see Kurt Potter.
What's a demur?
It's PG&E saying to the judge that we don't have a case. Their lawyers go --
Counts?
Reasons PG&E thinks it shouldn't go to --
Why good?
He's got a reputation for doing all his --
She insulted me!
Bullshit. It was a misunderstanding. But instead of handling it politely, instead of treating her with respect --

Why the fuck should I respect her?
Because <u>that's how people treat each other</u>!
Not in my world.

Gee, I wonder why.
If you tell me to relax, I'm gonna kick your fucking head off --

Look, this is serious now. They're talking serious money --
And, what, I'm not serious?

You're emotional. You're erratic. You say any God damn thing that comes into your head. And I'm not saying that's bad. That can be great; that can be a lot of fun --

Okay, now you're making this personal, and it isn't --
Okay, now you're making this personal, and it isn't --
<u>Not personal</u>? That's my <u>work</u> in there, Ed. My sweat, my labor, my time. If that's not personal, I don't know what is.
How dare you take that away from me.
No one's taking anything --
No one's taking anything --
Bullshit. You stuck me in Siberia dictating to some God damn steno clerk so you could finish this thing without me. After all I've done for you, that's the thanks I get.
Don't give me that. You've gotten plenty. You've been well-paid; you've gotten lots of perks ...
Perks? Jesus -- <u>perks</u>?
If you're here to fire me, your timing's lousy.
I'm not gonna fire you. I wanted to. But then you got sick, and that woulda made me look like a shit. You embarrassed me, Erin.
I'm not gonna fire you. I wanted to. But then you got sick, and that woulda made me look like a shit. You embarrassed me, Erin.

Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
And if you had to guess ...

With nothing linking it to the corporate offices yet, I'd say we'll end up on the lower end of that. Still a lot of money.
With nothing linking it to the corporate offices yet, I'd say we'll end up on the lower end of that. Still a lot of money.
So why would PG&E offer it?
So why would PG&E offer it?

Wait, what do you mean, ten years?
Five years, maybe, for a trial. Double that for the appeal.

Fuck Kurt.
Fuck Kurt.
Erin --
Erin --
No, I'm serious. You know what Kurt Potter is? He's the kind of guy who never would have taken this case in the first place. He's the kind of guy who would have sold these plaintiffs down the river when PG&E offered 20 million. He doesn't work like us, Ed. There's no little voice in his head telling him to do the right thing.
Morning!
Erin? What are you --
Erin? What are you --
You know what, Mr. Potter? I completely forgot your birthday this year. And seeing as how you've been so good to me, I think that is a terrible oversight. So what I been doing over the last few days is I've been putting together a present for you.
Ho - ly - shit.
Oh, now don't get all jealous, Ed. I got a little something for you, too.
I don't know what to say.
Say you were wrong.
Say you were wrong.
I was wrong.
I was wrong.
Say you shortchanged me and you shortchanged yourself.
Say you shortchanged me and you shortchanged yourself.
I did. Both.
I did. Both.
Say you'd be the luckiest son of a bitch on Earth if I didn't up and quit over all this.
Say you'd be the luckiest son of a bitch on Earth if I didn't up and quit over all this.
The luckiest son of a bitch in the universe, Erin. The luckiest son of a bitch in history.
But I know you're not gonna quit on me.
How do you know that?
How do you know that?
Cause you got a little voice in your head saying, do the right thing. Give him another chance.
Careful you don't spit from here; you could kill someone.
You see your office?
You see your office?
Yeah. Yours is nicer.
Yeah. Yours is nicer.
Oh, okay. Here it comes.
Oh, okay. Here it comes.
Here what comes?
Here what comes?
The extortion, the threats ...

Ed, I swear, I'm not --
Ed, I swear, I'm not --
Okay, fine. <u>Fine</u> You backed me into a corner again. You're holding me hostage ...
What is that?
Take it.
Two million dollars?
The firm took in sixty. That's three percent. Seemed like a fair bonus to me.
When'd they file the demur?
Yesterday.
How many counts?
Sixty-nine. We've got good answers to all of 'em.
Who's the judge?
Corey.
Corey.
Good.
I've also been thinking about the team. Responsibilities, who should cover what --
Right.
Right.
I think we should makes some changes.
I was working in the compressor, and out of nowhere the supervisor calls me up to the office and says, we're gonna give you a shredder machine, and send you on down to the warehouse. We want you to get rid of all the documents stored out there.
Did he say why?
Did he say why?
Nope. And I didn't ask.
Nope. And I didn't ask.
Did you get a look at the stuff you destroyed?
Did you get a look at the stuff you destroyed?
Well, it's pretty boring work, shredding -- you gotta find some way to entertain your mind. So yeah, I took a look.

There was a lot of dull stuff -- vacation schedules, the like. But then there were a few memos about the holding ponds. The water in them. They had readings from test wells, stuff like that.
And you were told to destroy those?
That's right.
Course as it turns out, I'm not a very good employee.
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
Well. There were a few documents that I somehow didn't get around to shredding. That I kept instead.
How come you didn't say anything when you found these things?
At the time, I thought, I got six kids, some of 'em want to go to college. I can't afford to lose my job. I told myself I was being honorable. But there's nothing honorable in what I did. Maybe that's why they picked me for the job. Maybe they knew what kind of man I was.
Oh, hey -- lemme give you a hand there.
Thank you very much. Aren't you a gentleman? Mr. ...
Thank you very much. Aren't you a gentleman? Mr. ...
Ross.
Ross.
Ross. Real pleased to meet you. I'm Erin.
Erin. Cool. What can I do for you, Erin?
Well, believe it or not, I am on the prowl for some water records.
Well, believe it or not, I am on the prowl for some water records.
You come to the right place.
You come to the right place.
I guess I did.
I guess I did.
You just tell me what you want to look at and I'll be glad to dig 'em out for you.
You just tell me what you want to look at and I'll be glad to dig 'em out for you.
I wish I knew. It's for my boss. He's fighting his water bill, and he wants me to find all manner of bills from all kinds of places. The easiest thing would probably be if I just squeezed back there with you and poked around myself. Would that be okay?

Heck, yeah. Come on back. Just gonna need you to sign in here --
Pattee? That your middle name?
Nope. Maiden.
Nope. Maiden.
You're married.
You're married.
Not anymore.
You know what, Erin? I got nothing but time here. Why don't you let me do that for you, and you can get your kids some dinner.
Ross -- you are an absolute angel.
Hey, Ross. Tell me something. Does PG&E pay you to cover their ass, or do you just do it out of the kindness of your heart?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I don't know what you're talking about.
The fuck you don't. No one calls me Pattee. That heavy-breathing sicko that called the other night could've only found out about me from you. People are dying, Ross. You got document after document here, right under your nose, that says why, and you haven't said word one about it. I wanna know how the hell you sleep at night.
What kind of chromium is it?
There's more than one kind?
There's more than one kind?
Yes. There's straight-up chromium -- does all kinds of good things for the body. There's chrom 3, which is fairly benign, and then there's chrom 6, hexavalent chromium, which, depending on the amounts, can be very harmful.
Yes. There's straight-up chromium -- does all kinds of good things for the body. There's chrom 3, which is fairly benign, and then there's chrom 6, hexavalent chromium, which, depending on the amounts, can be very harmful.
Harmful, like -- how? What would you get?
Harmful, like -- how? What would you get?
With repeated exposure to toxic levels -- God, anything, really -- respiratory disease, liver failure, heart failure, reproductive failure, chronic headaches, bone or organ deterioration -- plus, of course, any type of cancer.
So that stuff -- it kills people.
Oh, yeah. Definitely. Highly toxic, highly carcinogenic. Bad, bad stuff.
Oh, yeah. Definitely. Highly toxic, highly carcinogenic. Bad, bad stuff.
Well, how do I find out what kind of chromium is up in Hinkley?
Well, how do I find out what kind of chromium is up in Hinkley?
Have you been to the water board?
Have you been to the water board?
Hunh-uh. What's that?
Hunh-uh. What's that?
Every county has one. They keep records of anything water-related within their jurisdiction. You should be able to find something there.

County water board. All righty, thanks.
County water board. All righty, thanks.
Good luck. Oh -- I wouldn't advertise what you're looking for if I were you ...
Put your napkins in your laps and eat up.
How come you're not eating?
Mommy, can I get a flower?
Sweetheart, you can get a whole big bunch.
I hate it too. I hate this trip.
Oh, come on, where's your sense of adventure? We're going someplace you never been before.
Oh, come on, where's your sense of adventure? We're going someplace you never been before.
I'm gonna hate it.
Yeah. A real moron.
Some kind of half-wit, no-good, big-haired, bimbo, I bet.
Look, I know you're mad. But the way this job is, things come up at the last minute, real important things, and I gotta deal with them. Now I don't like me missing dinner any more than you do, but we're all gonna have to get used to it, cause the fact is, it's gonna happen sometimes.
It happens all the time.
It happens all the time.
That's not true; we had dinner together just last night.
What are you <u>doing</u>? Where's George?
I don't know.
I don't know.
George!
Masry & Vititoe, can I help you?
Hi, Rosalind, this is Erin. Brockovich. From the file room? I was wondering if you could tell Mr. Masry that I'm following up on that real estate thing out of the office.
You've been reading for hours.
I'm a slow reader, on account of the fact that I look at the word "dog" and see "god".
I'm a slow reader, on account of the fact that I look at the word "dog" and see "god".
Hey, just so long as you see Him.
Hey, Erin, I thought you were taking a sick day.
So did I.
What's going on in there?
Some meeting. With PG&E people.
Some meeting. With PG&E people.
PG& -- Are you sure?
PG& -- Are you sure?
Yup. They must be important, too, cause they came on a special plane.
Hey, Ros, where are they?
In the conference --
Hey, Ros. Nice view, huh?
Yeah, I'm gonna start sleeping here. Masry & Vititoe, can I -- damn it. Does anyone know anything about these phones?
There's no way a son of mine hates Funky Town. It's impossible.
Well I hate it.
Yeah.
Thank God we got you away from her, huh?
Can I play roller hockey?
We'll see.
We'll see.
When?
Randy's mom said yes right away.
Well, God damn it, Matthew -- Randy's mom doesn't work eighteen-hour days, and Randy's dad didn't leave her, so figuring out who's gonna take who where is a little easier over at Randy's house.
God damn it, Matthew. What the hell are you doing out here?
I'm gonna go live with George.
We'll work out the roller hockey thing, okay? Whatever you want, we'll work it out. I promise.
You always say that. Then you go to work and forget you promised.
You always say that. Then you go to work and forget you promised.
I never forget, honey. I try, real hard. It's just, for some reason, I don't seem to be able to organize things right and -- when it comes to you guys, I end up falling short.
I never forget, honey. I try, real hard. It's just, for some reason, I don't seem to be able to organize things right and -- when it comes to you guys, I end up falling short.
You never fall short for the work people. I guess maybe you just love them more.
You never fall short for the work people. I guess maybe you just love them more.
Oh, God, sweetheart, no. There's nothing on Earth I love more than you. Nothing. I promise.
She's one of the sick people?
Yeah. She is. But you know what? That's why I'm helping her. So she can get some medicine to make her feel better.
How come her own mom isn't helping her?
Cause her own mom's real sick, too.
Hey -- those are my files --
Yeah, we had them couriered over. And listen, good work. They're a great start. We're just going to have to spend a little time filling in the holes in your research.
Excuse me -- Theresa, was it? There are no holes in my research.
No offense. There are just some things we need that you probably didn't know to ask.

Okay, look -- I think we got off on the wrong foot here --
That's all you got, lady. Two wrong feet. In fucking ugly shoes.
Well, hello to you, darlin'.
What the hell do you think you're doing, making all that Goddamn noise?

Just introducing myself to the neighbors.
Just introducing myself to the neighbors.
Well, I'm the neighbors. There, now we're introduced, so you can shut the fuck up.
Ooh, now, see, if I'da known there was a beautiful woman next door, I'da done this different. Let's start over. My name's George. What's yours?
Just think of me as the person next door who likes it quiet, and we'll get along fine.
Just think of me as the person next door who likes it quiet, and we'll get along fine.
Now, don't be like that. Tell you what. How about if I take you out on a date to apologize for my rudeness?
You want my number?
I do.

Which number do you want, George?

You got a little girl?

Yeah. Sexy, huh? And here's another: five. That's how old my other daughter is. Seven is my son's age. Two is how many times I been married and divorced. You getting all this? 16 is the number of dollars in my bank account. 454-3943 is my phone number. And with all the other numbers I gave you, I'm guessing zero is the number of
No.
C'mon. I bought 'em for you, to make up for that night.
C'mon. I bought 'em for you, to make up for that night.
Return 'em. Maybe you'll get your money back.
I had a good neighbor, George. She was 60 and Mexican and she watched my kids for free. Something tells me you're not gonna be able to measure up to that.
You need help with your kids? I could probably do that.
I'm not gonna leave my kids with you.
Why not?
Why not?
Cause I don't even know you.
Cause I don't even know you.
Yeah, and whose fault is that?
Yeah. I'm probably ruining them.
How?
How?
I'm never here. I gotta leave 'em with this weird sitter all afternoon who costs a fortune and smells like chicken fat.
I'm never here. I gotta leave 'em with this weird sitter all afternoon who costs a fortune and smells like chicken fat.
I was serious before, you know. If you need someone to keep an eye on them -- after school or something -- I don't have a job now, so I'm around in the afternoons.

Why in the hell would you want to watch my kids?
Why in the hell would you want to watch my kids?
Cause I like kids. I like hanging out with them.
Cause I like kids. I like hanging out with them.
Right.
You're around every afternoon?
Yup. Usually working on my bike. No big deal. If it doesn't work out, you can send 'em back to the chicken fat lady.
This isn't gonna get you laid, you know.
Yeah, we'll just see about that, won't we?
What're you doing?
Better safe than sorry.
I'm gonna put a dead bolt on your front door, too. This isn't exactly the safest neighborhood in the world, you know.
Thanks for reminding me.
Thanks for reminding me.
I guess we get what we pay for, huh?
You think it could make you sick, living in a place like this?
What do you mean?
What are you doing here?
Fixing a leak under your sink.
Great.
I'm gonna clean it up.
What kind of person lives like this? Huh? What kind of person lets her kids run around in a house crawling with bugs the size of housecats?
It's a simple thing. Everybody gets them. All we gotta do is call an exterminator.

What? But you been working so hard --
What? But you been working so hard --
Doesn't matter. Doesn't make one bit of difference. Oh God, George, how'd this happen to me? How'd I end up so ... so <u>nothing</u>?
You're not nothing, Erin.
Well, I'm sure as hell not what I thought I was gonna be. I was supposed to have one of those great lives, with everything all laid- out and perfect. I mean, hell -- I was Miss Wichita, for God's sakes. Did I tell you that? You live next door to a real live beauty queen. I still got the tiara. I kept it

You are someone.
You are someone.
No I'm not. Look at me. I'm not.
No I'm not. Look at me. I'm not.
You're someone to me. You're someone real special to me.
George, I am just trying to do something nice for my kids on my one day off. Could you please not give me a hard time about it?
One toy per kid is doing something nice. Four is ... something else.

Well, hell, I guess that's it, then, huh? They're scarred for life. They're gonna start holding up 7-11's any day now.

I'm just saying --
I'm just saying --
I know what you're saying, and I don't wanna hear it. I am doing the best I can.
I'm not gonna quit cause of one creepy phone call, George.
Come on, Erin. A job's supposed to pay your bills, not put you in danger.
Come on, Erin. A job's supposed to pay your bills, not put you in danger.
I'm not in danger. I have a dead bolt. Remember?
Look, don't take this the wrong way, but don't you think you might be out of your league here?
No, see -- that's exactly what those arrogant PG&E fucks want me to think -- that because they got all this money and power, we don't stand a chance in hell against them. But you know what? They're wrong.
It doesn't have to be this complicated, Erin. There's a lot of jobs out there.
How would you know?
You mind telling me what that's supposed to mean?
Nothing.
Nothing.
If you got a problem with me taking care of your kids instead of getting some job, just say so.
If you got a problem with me taking care of your kids instead of getting some job, just say so.
I didn't say that.
I didn't say that.
Cause I can get a job. I will. And you can start leaving the kids with the chicken fat lady again. Would that make you happy?
Cause I can get a job. I will. And you can start leaving the kids with the chicken fat lady again. Would that make you happy?
Keep your voice down.
Keep your voice down.
I know what they can sleep through, Erin. I probably know it better than you.
I'm so tired I'm about to drive off the road. Keep me awake, willya?
What do you want, a joke?
What do you want, a joke?
No, no jokes, I gotta pee. Just tell me about your day. What went on back there?
No, no jokes, I gotta pee. Just tell me about your day. What went on back there?
Well, come to think of it, we did have a big event around here. Beth started talking.
Well, come to think of it, we did have a big event around here. Beth started talking.
What? Beth? My Beth?
What? Beth? My Beth?
Yeah. We were sitting around at lunch and she pointed at a ball and said, "ball."
I'm bored, and so are the kids.
Just a few more minutes, then we can go. Take her, will you?
I'm just saying -- we have one night to ourselves, why do we have to spend it here?
Cause it's my office party. If you had an office, I'd go to your party.
That's Ed.
Lock the door.
Lock the door.
No, I wanna say hi.
It wouldn't kill you to talk about something other than yourself and your own fucking job once in a while --
What do you want to talk about instead? <u>Your</u> day? That's a fascinating subject.
Fuck you. Just cause I don't spend all day trying to prove what hot shit I am --
That is not what I'm --
That is not what I'm --
Bull<u>shit</u>, Erin. Bullshit.
What's going on? What are you doing?
Thinking.
Thinking.
About what?
About this.
What's that?
What's that?
It's a pair of earrings. I saw 'em in the mall one day, and I thought, damn, those would look good on those beautiful earlobes. So I bought 'em. And I said to myself, next time Erin says something nice, does something nice, I'll surprise her with 'em. Know how long ago that was? Six months. In six months, you haven't said one nice

I can't leave my job, George.
Yeah, you can. You could just quit. People do it all the time.
Yeah, you can. You could just quit. People do it all the time.
I can't. Look -- this job -- it's the best thing that ever happened to me. I mean it. For the first time in my life, I got people respecting me. Up in Hinkley, I walk into a room and everyone shuts up just to hear what I got to say. I never had that. Ever. Don't ask me to give it up. I

More than you need me.
More than you need me.
I need it.
You already packed up your stuff?
I pretty much knew what your answer was gonna be.
They said that'd be tomorrow. They just wanna keep an eye on me another night.
Fine. I'll drop 'em off tomorrow afternoon.
Thank you.
Mm-hm.
Hello?
Hi. It's me. I got a favor to ask you.
Hi. It's me. I got a favor to ask you.
I don't do favors for you anymore.
I don't do favors for you anymore.
It's not for me; it's for my kids. You're the only one I trust them with.
They up?
Hunh-uh. Not yet. Look, don't take any of 'em on your bike, okay? Call a cab if you wanna go somewhere.
How long's this whole thing gonna take?
I don't know. Few days. Thanks for helping me. I appreciate it.
And I miss you.
Yeah, well -- good help is hard to find.
Think you could learn?
You know me. I pick things up real fast.
You shouldn't be driving around, you know. You're sick.
Yeah, but I'm gonna get better. A lot of these folks aren't.
What time is it?
Real early. We're just gonna take your car to get some breakfast.
No, I need my car --
We'll just be a minute. Get a little more sleep.
Promise you'll turn around if you get tired.
I will. Bye.
I'm embarrassed.
That's okay. I understand.
That's okay. I understand.
It's just -- the pain. It's only getting worse. I can't be a good wife. I can't be a good mother.
It's just -- the pain. It's only getting worse. I can't be a good wife. I can't be a good mother.
I'm real sorry, Laura.
Know what I always thought I wanted outta life, Erin? A Jaguar.
Jaguar's a darn pretty car.
Jaguar's a darn pretty car.
I thought if I could spend that kinda money on a car, it'd mean everything else was fine. I don't even know how much they cost.
I thought if I could spend that kinda money on a car, it'd mean everything else was fine. I don't even know how much they cost.
A lot. But you hang in there, maybe you'll get one.
I mean, it's not a problem or anything, but -- I'm just a little unclear on what those things are. I thought maybe you'd know.
What do I look like, Erin? A library?
Someone stole my stuff.
Nice to see you, Erin. We've missed you.
Nice to see you, Erin. We've missed you.
I had photos of my kids, plus a mug --
-- toothbrush, toothpaste, and a pair of hose. Here.
What's going on?
What's going on?
There may be jobs where you can disappear for days at a time, but this isn't one of them. Here, if you don't do the work, you don't get to stay.
What am I supposed to do, check in every two seconds?
Yes. It's called accountability.
Yes. It's called accountability.
I am not talking to you, bitch.
I am not talking to you, bitch.
<u>Excuse me</u>?
Where's my paycheck?
Have you been logging on?
Have you been logging on?
What?
What?
I moved payroll onto the computer. It only knows to process paychecks for employees who log on in the morning and off at night.

Now how'm I supposed to do that when I'm not in here most mornings and nights?
Now how'm I supposed to do that when I'm not in here most mornings and nights?
You're clever. I'm sure you'll think of something.
Excuse me, are you Erin Brockovich?
Yeah. Who are you?
When Donna told us about you, and what you told her about the chromium, we figured that might have something to do with this, too.
It sure could, yeah. Thanks a lot.
There's something else, too.
What?
I know. It's an awful lot.
I'm surprised Donna didn't say anything.
You know that thing it says in here about rashes?
Uh-huh?
Uh-huh?
Well, this old neighbor of mine, Bob Linwood -- he ran the dairy on Community -- seemed like someone in his family always had a rash somewhere or other. I just figured it was something in the genes. And you know how it is -- you don't like to ask about things like that ...
Hi, sweetie. Were you a good girl? Where are Matt and Katie?
Outside with the sprinkler. So it's good?
It'll be fine, yeah.
Ai, bueno. Because I didn't want to tell you before, with your worries --
Ai, bueno. Because I didn't want to tell you before, with your worries --
What?

My daughter, she's bought a big house with a room for me. I'm going to move in with her.
My daughter, she's bought a big house with a room for me. I'm going to move in with her.
You're moving away? When?
You're moving away? When?
Next week.
Next week.
Wow, that's soon --
Wow, that's soon --
I know. But it's good for me. Now I can help my daughter take care of my grandkids. And it's good for you, too. Now you have money, you can find a good babysitter, huh? Not the old lady next door.
Dr. Paulsen?
Yes?
Yes?
Hi, I'm Erin Brockovich. I was just over in the library there, asking a mess of questions about -- I guess they call it epidemiology? -- and the fella there told me to find you, cause you know all about it.

Is this a joke? Did Baxter put you up to this?
Is this a joke? Did Baxter put you up to this?
Who's Baxter?

He did, didn't he? <u>Baxter</u>!
Oh. Oh.
No one put me up to anything. I was just hoping I could ask you a couple questions.
No one put me up to anything. I was just hoping I could ask you a couple questions.
Of course! Oh, gosh, of course --
Well, look, there isn't a ton of information here, but from what there is, I'd say that these two people here -- what are their names? Shanna and Ashley?
Right, I guess those are the kids --
Right, I guess those are the kids --
They've both got some immune system problem. Can't say what from, whether it's viral or genetic or what, but something's wrong. And these guys -- Donna and Peter --

Their parents, I'm pretty sure.
Their parents, I'm pretty sure.
Well, from what this stuff says, I'd say they both have some form of cancer.
... and when I realized our area's just as bad as Hinkley, I thought maybe my neighbors are all sick too. So I went and asked.
You did?
Uh-huh. Spent the last few days knocking on doors. And you know what? They're not. I mean, they got problems, but none of this cancer stuff. And their pets are fine. So I don't know -- I just can't shake the feeling that it wasn't no multivitamin they put in the water.
Well, if you're talking about contamination, you're getting out of my area of expertise. Let me give you the name of a toxicologist friend of mine over at USC.
I gotta say, Erin -- first time I saw you, I did not peg you as the kind to go off and conduct her own epidemiological study.
Don't go telling anyone. It'll ruin my reputation.
It was .... the Emperor ....
The Emperor?
The Emperor?
Yes, he commands you make contact with him ....
Yes, he commands you make contact with him ....
Move this ship out of the asteroid field and into a position where we can send a clear transmission.
Move this ship out of the asteroid field and into a position where we can send a clear transmission.
Yes, My Lord.
Yes, My Lord.
And code the signal to my private chamber.
My lord.
Come in, Admiral.
Our pursuit ships have sighted the Millennium Falcon, My Lord. It has entered an asteroid field.
Asteroids don't concern me, Admiral. I want that ship, not excuses. How long until you can have Skywalker and the others in the Millennium Falcon before me?
Asteroids don't concern me, Admiral. I want that ship, not excuses. How long until you can have Skywalker and the others in the Millennium Falcon before me?
Soon, Lord Vader.
Soon, Lord Vader.
Yes, Admiral .... soon.
Lord Vader, our ships have completed their scan of the area and found nothing. The Millennium Falcon definitely went into lightspeed. It's probably on the other side of the galaxy by now.
Alert all commands. Calculate every possible destination along their last known trajectory and disburse the fleet to search for them. Don't fail me again, Admiral, I've had quite enough!

Yes, My Lord. We'll find them.
He will learn patience.
Much anger in him, like in his father.
Much anger in him, like in his father.
We've discussed this before.
He can do it.
This one I have watched a long time. All his life has he looked away ... to the horizon, to the sky, to the future. Never his mind on where he was, on what he was doing. Adventure, excitement ... A Jedi craves not these things!
He'll learn.
He's too old. Yes. Too old to start the training.
Will he finish what he begins?
We've come this far ... He is our only hope.
Stopped they must be. Do you hear? On this all depends.
You are the last Jedi, Luke. You are our only hope. Be patient.
Luke, use The Force only for knowledge and for defense, not as a weapon. Don't give in to hate or anger or fear ... they lead the way to the dark side ... Luke nods and climbs back into his ship.
Strong is Vader. Clouded is your fate. Mind what you have learned ... Notice everything, everything! It can save you.
Told you, I did. Reckless is he ... Now things are going to worse.
The boy is our last hope.
The boy is our last hope.
No ... there is another.
I can't ...
You must. Luke, look at me!
You must survive, Luke.
I'm cold ... so cold ...
I'm cold ... so cold ...
You must go to the Dagobah System ... There you will learn from one who taught me: Yoda, the Jedi Master.
You must go to the Dagobah System ... There you will learn from one who taught me: Yoda, the Jedi Master.
Ben ... Ben ...
Ben ... Ben ...
Luke ... you are the only hope.
... Luke, you must not go.
But Han and Leia will surely die.
But Han and Leia will surely die.
You don't know that. Even I cannot see their fate.

I can help them!
I can help them!
You're not ready yet. You still have much to learn.
You're not ready yet. You still have much to learn.
I feel The Force.
I feel The Force.
But you cannot control it. This is a dangerous time for you, Luke. You are now most susceptible to the temptations of the dark side.
Will you? You underestimate The Emperor. It is you he wants ... that is why your friends suffer.
And that is why I must go.
And that is why I must go.
Luke, I will not lose you to the Emperor, as I lost Vader.
Luke, I will not lose you to the Emperor, as I lost Vader.
You won't.
You won't.
Only a fully trained Jedi Knight, with The Force as his ally, will conquer Vader and his Emperor. If you end your training now, if you choose the quick and easy path ... as Vader did ... you will become an agent of evil ... and the galaxy will be plunged deeper into the abyss of hate, despair and pain that you feel your
How you doing, Chewbacca? Still wasting your time with this clown, eh?
Growls a reserved greeting.
Growls a reserved greeting.
Right.
Barks at the mention of food. Licks his lips.
Everyone's invited, of course.
Barks a blue streak.
What's wrong with him?
Three patrol ships are heading our way.
Barks an argument and shakes his head.
Turns on Lando, the newcomer, with an ominous growl.
Okay, okay.
Howls.
We're not out of this yet.
Well, it's been awhile.
Barks and growls at his boss.
Barks and growls at his boss.
That was a long time ago. I'm sure he's forgotten all about it, and so should you.
Howls and shrugs his shoulders.
Why don't we just turn him over to Lando to fix?
Barks at Han.
Not now, Chewie. Lando, aren't you afraid the Empire might discover this little operation and shut you down?
Barks his concern.
No, I'm alright. I'm alright.
Barks a doleful farewell.
I'm sure I'll see you again, too. Keep well. You'd better chain him until it's over.
Barks at his master.
What happened?
We should have stayed and finished them off.
Barks his agreement.
I don't care. It would've been worth it .... for Han.
Barks his Òright on!Ó
... the power?
Howls.
Barks his consternation.
Chewie, head for the bottom of the city.
Okay, Chewie, it's now or never.
Barks his agreement.
... Like we're being watched.
Away put your weapon. I mean you no harm.
I'm looking for someone.
Looking? Looking? You've found someone I'd say. Heh? Yes!
Looking? Looking? You've found someone I'd say. Heh? Yes!
Yeah ...
Yeah ...
Help you I can ... yes ... yes.
Help you I can ... yes ... yes.
I'm looking for a great warrior.
I'm looking for a great warrior.
A great warrior? Not many on those. Wars don't make one great.
Listen, friend, we didn't mean to land here, and if I could get my fighter out of this puddle I would, but I can't. So ...
Can't get your ship out? Have you tried? Have you tried?
Give me that!
Mine! Mine! Or I'll help you not.
I don't want your help. I want my lamp back. I'll need it in this slimy mudhole.
Mudhole? Slimy? My home this is.
Mine, mine.
Okay, Artoo, let him have it. Now get out of here, little fellow, we've got things to do.
Okay, Artoo, let him have it. Now get out of here, little fellow, we've got things to do.
No, no! I'll stay and help you find your friend.
No, no! I'll stay and help you find your friend.
I'm not looking for a friend. I'm looking for a Jedi Master.
I'm not looking for a friend. I'm looking for a Jedi Master.
Oh, a Jedi Master. Different altogether. Yoda you seek, Yoda.
Oh, a Jedi Master. Different altogether. Yoda you seek, Yoda.
You know the Jedi Master?
You know the Jedi Master?
Of course, yes. But now eat we must. Good food, I have good food. Come, come.
... I told you, I'm not hungry.
Patience. It's time to eat.
Patience. It's time to eat.
Look, it smells good. I'm sure it's delicious But I don't know why we can't see Yoda now.
Look, it smells good. I'm sure it's delicious But I don't know why we can't see Yoda now.
It's the Jedi's time to eat, too.

Will it take long to get there? How far away is he?

Not far, not far. Be patient. Soon you will see him. Why wish you become a Jedi?
Not far, not far. Be patient. Soon you will see him. Why wish you become a Jedi?
Because of my father, I guess.

Oh, your father ... a powerful Jedi was he, powerful Jedi.

How could you know my father? You don't even know who I am. Can't we get on with this already?
Yes sir!
Sergeant, is Commander Skywalker back yet?

I haven't seen him. He probably came in through the south entrance.
I haven't seen him. He probably came in through the south entrance.
Probably isn't good enough, Sergeant. Check on it!

Then I'll see you in Hell.
What is thy bidding, My Master?
There is a grave disturbance in The Force.

I have felt it.

Our situation is most precarious. We have a new enemy who could bring about our destruction.

He will join us or die, My Master.
Captain Solo. What's the situation?
There isn't a hint of life in the area. But all the perimeter markers are set, so you'll know if anyone comes calling.

The Empire won't look for you out here. I'd say you're all set ... which means it's time for me to get going.
That's right.
You're an extraordinary fighter. I hate to lose you.
You're an extraordinary fighter. I hate to lose you.
Thank you, General. But there's a price on my head. If I don't pay off Jabba the Hutt, I'm a walking dead man.
Thank you, General. But there's a price on my head. If I don't pay off Jabba the Hutt, I'm a walking dead man.
I understand. A death mark is not an easy thing to live with ... Until our paths cross again, may the force be with you.
Whatever it is, it isn't friendly. I'm going to have a look. Come on, Chewie.
Wait. I'll send a patrol with you.
Wait. I'll send a patrol with you.
Fine. But they'll have to take care of themselves.
Captain Solo, sir. Might I have a word with you?
What is it?
What is it?
Mistress Leia has been trying to reach you on the communicator, but either you have it turned off, or it is malfunctioning ... if it's damaged, Artoo, could fix it, if you like.

I shut it off. What's her royal holiness want?
I shut it off. What's her royal holiness want?
She is looking for Master Luke, and assumed he would be here with you. No one seems to know ...
I don't know, Artoo. Sir, might I inquire what's going on?
Go tell your precious Princess ... Luke is dead unless he shows up soon.
He doesn't make sense to me either, Chewie.
I do hope he's all there ... if you take my meaning. I would hate to see Master Luke develop a short circuit ...
I do hope he's all there ... if you take my meaning. I would hate to see Master Luke develop a short circuit ...
The kid ran into something mean, and it wasn't the cold.
Transport XJ. get out of here. Go!
The energy shield is down. We'll be stuck here forever.
Sir, I was wondering ...
Sit down, and shut up!
Sit down, and shut up!
It can wait.
I think we're in trouble.
If I may say so, Sir, I noticed earlier that the entire main para- light system seems to be damaged.

We're in trouble!
What are you so grouchy about?
Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but does shutting down all but emergency power systems include me?
You, too, golden rod.
I must admit there are times I don't understand human behavior.
It sounds like it's trying to get in.
I'm going to see what it is.
We're doomed. Goodbye, Mistress Leia. Goodbye, Captain ...
Not collapsing, honey. It's closing! This is no cave ...
I can see the edge of the asteroid field, sir.
Good. Soon as we're clear, we'll kick this baby into hyperdrive.
Yes, Your Highness?
You said you were going to stay. What happened?

That bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind.

Does Luke know?
Does Luke know?
He'll know when he gets back ... Don't give me that look. Every day more bounty hunters are searching for me. If I don't pay off Jabba soon, there'll be too many to stop ... Remotes, Gank killers, and who knows what else. I've got to get that price off my head while I still have a head.

We?

I respect you. You're a bold fighter, maybe not the brightest, but ... HAN No, your worship.. That's not what I'm talking about.
Am I? I say you came running after me because you were afraid I was leaving you without even a kiss.
I'd just as soon kiss a wookiee.
I'd just as soon kiss a wookiee.
There's no accounting for taste. Believe me, you could use a good kiss. You've spent so much time doing your duty and giving orders you've never learned how to be a woman. It's a shame, because you've got all the makings for one. I could have helped you plenty in that department ... if you'd have let go for a minute. But it's too

And you think you're the one to apply some heat?
Sure ... If I were interested. But I don't think it'd be much fun.
Those creatures he keeps talking about ... we'd better double the security ... Han, I don't know how ...
Forget it.
Now all we've got to worry about is what attacked him.
No kidding. If this snowball's got nasty natives, they could be anywhere.
.... I'm afraid there's not much left.
What was it?
What was it?
Droid of some kind. I didn't hit it that hard. It must have had a self-destruct ....
Droid of some kind. I didn't hit it that hard. It must have had a self-destruct ....
An Imperial probe droid.
An Imperial probe droid.
Now don't panic. We don't know that.
Well, your worship, it looks like you arranged to keep me close by for a while longer.
I had nothing to do with it. General Rieekan thinks it's dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we know where that probe came from.
I don't know what he's talking about.
Ooops! I guess you haven't told Luke about that yet.
You must have gone completely out of your feeble mind.
Come on, your highness, are you telling me you haven't been thinking about that kiss?
Why you low-down, stuck-up, half- witted, scruffy-looking nerf-herder.
Who's scruffy-looking? I tell ya' sweetheart, I must've hit pretty close to the mark to get you hoppin' like this. Doesn't it look that way to you, Luke?
Hey! Someone's still in here.
Wait, don't open it ... that's one of the traps for the ice creatures.
Would it help if I got out and pushed?
Don't worry, your holiness, I'll get her started.
This bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade.
This baby's got a few surprises left in her.
This baby's got a few surprises left in her.
I'll be surprised if we ever start moving.
I know, I know, I see them ... LEIA See what?
Two more Star Destroyers heading right at us.
Two more Star Destroyers heading right at us.
I'm glad you said there was going to be no problem, or I'd be worried.
That was no laser blast .... some- thing hit us ....
Or you ran into something ....
Asteroids! Chewie, bank left, let's find out where they're coming from ...
Probably an asteroid field ....
Probably an asteroid field ....
Let's hope so ... it's just the chance we need.
Let's hope so ... it's just the chance we need.
To get killed ... you're not seriously going into an asteroid field?

Aren't I? Hang on, sweetheart. We're gonna do some flyin'.
Well, you said you wanted to be there when I was wrong.
I take it back.

That Star Destroyer is slowing down.

Good.
But we're going to get pulverized if we stay out here much longer.
I'm against that.
I'm against that.
We've got to get out of this shower.
We've got to get out of this shower.
Now you're making sense.
Now you're making sense.
Right. I'm going to get in closer to one of these big ones ...
There, there. Chewie get a reading on that. Looks pretty good.
What is it?
What is it?
That should do nicely.
Why, Princess, this is so sudden.
Very funny. You can let go now .... I'm getting angry.
Very funny. You can let go now .... I'm getting angry.
You don't look angry.
You don't look angry.
How do I look?
How do I look?
Beautiful.
Sorry, Captain, being held by you isn't enough to get me excited.
Well, I hope you don't expect more.
Well, I hope you don't expect more.
I don't expect anything, except to be left alone.
I don't expect anything, except to be left alone.
Fine with me. But I'm afraid you'll have to let go.
That was no earthquake.
Felt like a hydro concussion ... an Imperial Cruiser.
They're moving away.
They're just trying to see if they can stir something up ... we're safe.
They're just trying to see if they can stir something up ... we're safe.
Where have I heard that before?
Easy, your worship. Only trying to help.
Would you please stop calling me that?
Sure. I guess I make it difficult sometimes.
Yes, you do.
Yes, you do.
You could be a touch warmer, though. Admit it, against your better judgment you think I'm all right.
Sometimes, maybe ... occasionally, when you aren't acting like a scoundrel.
That's quite a compliment.
Stop that.
Why?
What are you afraid of?
Afraid of? Certainly not you Captain Solo ... or any other man in this galaxy.
Don't count on it. I happen to like nice men.
Sure, they're safer. You always know what they're going to do. Trouble is, it gets a little dull.

I do not!
I do not!
Try and control this ...
There's something out there!
Where?
Where?
Outside, in the cave.
Are you crazy!
Look, we just got this bucket going again. I'm not about to let some varmint tear it apart ...
Looks like some kind of Mynock.
There will be more of them. They always travel in groups. And there's nothing they like better than to attach themselves to ships. Just what we need right now.
Those Star Destroyers will spot us long before you can get into light speed. You can't make the jump in this asteroid field.
Strap yourself in, sweetheart, we're taking off!
Strap yourself in, sweetheart, we're taking off!
But the tremors have stopped.
I see it Chewie, hang on.
The entrance is collapsing!
Couldn't be, I checked the transfer circuits, just like you said! I tell you this time it's not my fault. I'm sure I checked it.
No lightspeed?
No lightspeed?
It's not my fault. I can't under- stand it!
Sharp bank, Chewie. Let's turn this bucket around. You heard me, turn around! Full power on the front shield.
You're going to attack them?!!!
You could have warned him before you shut him off.
Oh, so sorry! Didn't mean to offend your droid. You think braking and shutting down in that amount of time is easy?
Oh, so sorry! Didn't mean to offend your droid. You think braking and shutting down in that amount of time is easy?
I'm still not sure what you've accomplished.
I'm still not sure what you've accomplished.
Chewie, check the manual release on the landing claws.
What'd you have in mind for your next move?
The fleet is finally breaking up. I'm hoping they'll follow standard Imperial procedure and dump their garbage before they go into light speed.
Not bad, hot shot, not bad. Then what?
Then we have to find a safe port around here. Got any ideas?
Then we have to find a safe port around here. Got any ideas?
That depends. Where are we?
That depends. Where are we?
Here ... near the Anoat system.
Funny, I have the feeling I've been in this area before. Let me check my logs.
You keep logs? My, how organized.
You keep logs? My, how organized.
Well, sometimes ... Ah-hah, I knew it! Lando Calrissian.
Well, sometimes ... Ah-hah, I knew it! Lando Calrissian.
Never heard of that system.

Lando's not a system, he's a man. A gambler, con-artist ... all- around scoundrel ... ... your kind of guy. The system is called Bespin. It's a ways from here, but reachable.

A Tibanna gas mine. Lando won it in a sabacc match, or so he claims. Lando and I go way back.

Can you trust him?
Can you trust him?
No. But he has no love for the Empire, that much I know ...
You do have your moments ... Not many, but you do have them.
Let Ôer go, Chewie.
I don't like this.
It'll be all right. Trust me. And keep your eyes open. You wait here.
What are you staring at?
Who's staring?
Who's staring?
You look silly.

You look great.

Has Threepio turned up yet?
Has Threepio turned up yet?
Huh? Oh. Your droid's been gone too long just to be lost. He may have gotten into some trouble. Chewie went to look for him. Come over here. I want to check this out.
I hope Luke made it to the fleet all right.
Luke! I'm sure he's fine. Probably sitting around wondering what we're doing right now.
He found him in a junk pile ...
Something's wrong here. Your friend Lando is very charming, but I don't trust him.
Something's wrong here. Your friend Lando is very charming, but I don't trust him.
Well, I do trust him. Lando's an old friend. Must have been an accident.
Well, I do trust him. Lando's an old friend. Must have been an accident.
Chewie, do you think you can repair him?
No thanks.
Look, sweetheart, I'm not going to have you accusing my friend of ...
I was worried about you.
I'm worried about all of us. I can't figure out what they're up to.
I'm worried about all of us. I can't figure out what they're up to.
Me either. They had me howling on the scan grid, but they never asked me any questions.
... I love you. I couldn't tell you before, but it's true.
... just remember that, Ôcause I'll be back ...
Loud and clear, kid. What's up?
I've finished my circle and I haven't picked up any life read- ings.
I've finished my circle and I haven't picked up any life read- ings.
There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. My sentry markers are placed. I'm heading back to the base.
There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. My sentry markers are placed. I'm heading back to the base.
I'll see you shortly. A meteorite just hit the ground near here and I want to check it out .. Won't be long.
Hi kid, you look strong enough to wrestle a Gundark.
Thanks to you.
Thanks to you.
That's two you owe me, junior.
Probe? What probe?
That makes a good story. But I think you just can't bear to let me out of your sight.
About what?
Now don't get the wrong idea, pal. She was just trying to express her true feelings for me.
I hope you make your peace with Jabba.
Don't worry. You haven't seen the last of us.
Why you slimy, double-crossing no-good swindler ... am I glad to see you.
No hard feelings?
No hard feelings?
Are you kidding?
Are you kidding?
I always said you were a gentleman.
I always said you were a gentleman.
I'll bet.
That won't be easy, my friend ... What brings you here, anyway?
Repairs ...
Repairs ...
What have you done to my ship?
That ship saved my life a few times. It's the fastest hunk of machinery in the galaxy. What's wrong with her?
Hyperdrive.
Hyperdrive.
I'll have my people get to work on it right away. Hate the thought of the Millennium Falcon without her heart.
How's your mining operation going?
Not as well as I'd like. We're a small outpost and not very self- sufficient. I've had supply problems of every kind and ... What's so funny?
Not as well as I'd like. We're a small outpost and not very self- sufficient. I've had supply problems of every kind and ... What's so funny?
Nothing. I never would have guessed that underneath that wild schemer I knew was a respon- sible leader and businessman ... But you wear it well.
Sorry friend, I had no choice. They arrived right before you did.
I'm sorry too.
Get out of here, Lando!
Shut up a minute and listen. I'm doing what I can to make this easier for you.

This ought to be good.

Vader agreed to turn Leia and Chewie over to me. They'll have to stay here, but at least they'll be safe.
You don't know much about much if you think Vader won't want us dead before this is over.
He doesn't want you at all. He's after someone named Skywalker.
He doesn't want you at all. He's after someone named Skywalker.
Luke? I don't get it.
All this just to get the kid? What's so important about him?
Don't ask me, but he's on his way.
Don't shoot! I've done what I can for you. I'm sorry it's not better, but I've got my own problems. I've already stuck my neck out further than I should ...
Yeah, you're a real hero.
What about Leia and the Wookiee?
You will find them well enough. But they must never again leave this city.

That was never mentioned. Neither was this bounty hunter taking Han. I hope you haven't forgotten our bargain.

I forget nothing, Calrissian. Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly.
I forget nothing, Calrissian. Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly.
No.
No.
Good. It would be most unfortunate if I had to leave a permanent garrison here.
We only use this chamber for carbon freezing. If you put him in there, it'll kill him.
I think not. But I don't wish my prize to be damaged. We'll test it first. Bring in Captain Solo.
I'll take what's mine now.
Take them, but I'm keeping a detachment of troops here to watch over them.

That wasn't the bargain. You said the Empire wouldn't interfere in--

I'm altering the bargain. Pray I don't alter it any further.
Hello! What have we here? Welcome, I am Baron Lando Calrissian, Administrator of this facility ... and who might you be?
You may call me Leia.
Sorry, am I interrupting anything?
Not really.
Not really.
I must say, your beauty is unpar- alleled. Truly you belong here with us among the clouds.

Thanks.
Thanks.
Would you care to join me for a little refreshment?
.... We are a free station and do not fall under the jurisdiction of the Empire.
You're part of the mining guild then?
You're part of the mining guild then?
Not actually .... Our operation is small enough not to be noticed, so you might say we're enterprisers. Most of our trade is, well ... unofficial.
It's a lovely outpost.
Yes, we keep pollution down by having the power reactor far below the city. It's connected by a transfer shaft.
What about Han?
I didn't know you had a price on your head. Vader has given you to the bounty hunter.
Lord Vader has set a trap for him and ...
... we're the bait.
What's going on?
I'm coming over to your side, that's what. And I have a feeling I'm making a big mistake.
I'm coming over to your side, that's what. And I have a feeling I'm making a big mistake.
And when do you betray us again?
Look, I stand to lose everything by this.
We have no use for your kind.
We have no use for your kind.
This is no time to be choosy, honey. What do you say we debate this later? There's still a chance I can get you out of here.
Chewie's right. We must try to save Han.
There's not much chance, but the bounty hunter's ship is on the East Landing Platform.
Very noble. Not smart, but noble.
You've probably never done an honorable thing in your life.
You've probably never done an honorable thing in your life.
Sure I did ... once. It turned out lousy.
Sure I did ... once. It turned out lousy.
What chance have we got in here? What are we going to do when they cut ...
You'd better know what you're doing, or this is going to get very messy.
Don't worry about a thing. I'll get us going.
We've got to find Luke.
His fate is sealed. You'll be lucky to get out yourself. All systems are on alert. everything's locked.
What'd you say?
I didn't say anything?
I knew that set-up was too good to last .... I'm going to miss it.
Luke!
Luke!
What?
What?
Luke needs help. We must go back.
No argument, just do it. That's a command!
Wait a minute. We're not going back there.
Someone's falling.
It's Luke. Get under him. Slow down. Easy Chewie. Line up your tracking system. Lando, open the hatch.
The deflector shields are gone.
Are the coordinates set?
I'm sure my men fixed it. We've got nothing to worry about.
That sounds familiar.
Nothing more can be done tonight. The shield doors must be closed. I can't wait any longer. I'm sorry.
I understand.
The speeders should be ready in the morning. They'll make the search easier.
Is there any chance of them surviving out there?
Is there any chance of them surviving out there?
Slim, but yes, there's a chance. They have a shelter. It's not much, but ...
Have they analyzed the one that was killed?
Not yet. They're working on it now.
We've picked up something outside the base in zone one, moving East.
What is it?
Two transports at a time is awfully risky.
We have no choice. Send them up ... and start clearing everyone out.
You rest now.
So much has happened during the period of your indisposition, sir.
So much has happened during the period of your indisposition, sir.
I'll be back later.
You don't have to do this to impress me.
If I might remind you, sir, the probability of successfully navi- gating through an asteroid field is approximately 365,000 to one ... a graceful surrender might not be ...
Closer?!
Closer?!
A tremor!
Sir, it's very possible this asteroid is not stable.
What??
Oh my, no!
Sir, we've lost the rear deflector shield. One more direct hit on the back quarter and we're done for.
Well, what now?
Rather touchy, aren't they.
I thought you knew this person.
Artoo, you did it! I never doubted you for a second ...
Let's go.
The Bacta are growing well. The scars should be gone in a day or so. Does it still hurt?
I'm fine. Really. Leia ... when I was out there and it looked pretty bad ... well, it made me think about things.
I'm fine. Really. Leia ... when I was out there and it looked pretty bad ... well, it made me think about things.
Me too. I was afraid.
Leia ... What would you think if I went away for a while?
What did you say?!
Where are you going?
I have this ... feeling. I'm not sure, really ...

That's just great. Why doesn't everyone just take off?

Luke, no! It's a trap.
Lando, is he alright? ... Lando? Are you there? How's Luke?
He'll survive.
This hyperdrive had better work.
I've never seen it fail.
Ready are you? What know you of ready? I have trained Jedi for 800 years. My own counsel I'll keep on who is to be trained.
Why not me?
Why not me?
To become a Jedi takes the deepest commitment, the most serious mind.
I have followed my feelings.
You are reckless!
I will not fail you. I'm not afraid.
You will be, my young one. Heh. You will be.
It would be in seven pieces, were you a Jedi.
I thought I was in good shape.
I thought I was in good shape.
Yes, but by what standard, ask I? Forget your old measures. Unlearn, heh, unlearn.
Master, moving rocks is one thing, but this is a little different.
No! No different! The differences are in your mind. Throw them out! No longer of use are they to you.

Okay. I'll give it a try.
Okay. I'll give it a try.
No. Try not. Do, do. Or do not. There is no try.
I can't. It's too big.
Size has no meaning. It matters not. Look at me. Judge me by my size do you?
I don't believe it.
That is why you fail.
Concentration. Heh? Concentration.
I thought those seekers were set for stun!

They're a lot stronger than I'm used to.
They're a lot stronger than I'm used to.
That would matter not were The Force flowing through you. Higher you'd jump! Faster you'd move! Open yourself to The Force you must.
No, no. This will not do. Anger is what you feel.
But I feel The Force flowing!
But I feel The Force flowing!
Anger, fear, aggression! The dark side of The Force are they. Easily they flow ... quick to join you in a fight. Beware, beware, beware of them. A heavy price is paid for the power they bring.
Price? What do you mean?
The dark side beckons. But if once start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny. Consume you it will ... as it did Obi-wan's apprentice.

No, no. Easier, quicker, more seductive.
But how am I to know the good side from the dark?

You will know. When you are at peace ... calm ... passive. A Jedi uses The Force for knowledge and defense. Never for attack.

No! Nothing more will I tell you now. Clear your mind of questions ... Quiet now be ... at peace ...
Four this time! The Force you feel.
Yes ... I also feel danger ... death. Something's not right.
I feel cold.

Will they die?
Difficult to see. Always in motion is the future ... Back away, little machine!
They're my friends.
Foreknowledge is helpful, but painful sometimes and dangerous too. You have far to go in your training.
Yes, yes. To Obi-wan you listen young one. The tree. Remember your failure at the tree! Heh?
I've learned so much since then. And I'll return to finish ... I promise that, master.
And sacrifice Han and Leia?
If it must be. Yes.
The fear does not reach you. You have learned more than I anticipated.
You'll find I'm full of surprises.
You'll find I'm full of surprises.
And I too.
Your future lies with us, Skywalker. Now you will embrace the dark side. Obi-wan knew this to be true.
No!
No!
There is much Obi-wan did not tell you. Come, The Emperor will complete your training.

I'll die first.
I'll die first.
That won't be necessary.
All too easy. Perhaps you are not as strong as The Emperor thought.
Time will tell.
The Force runs strong in the Skywalker line. You will achieve great power ... Come, join with me! Together we will be the most powerful ... even stronger than The Emperor.
No! .... Never ....
There is no escape. You must join me or die. Don't make me destroy you here ... The Emperor is strong with The Force. But if you join me, together we could overthrow Him. Do not resist. It is our destiny!
Never.
The Hoth System?
Yes, Sir .... we have visuals ... the System is supposed to be devoid of human forms ...
Yes, My Lord.
Make ready to land General Veers' assault troops on the surface. Then deploy the fleet so that nothing can get off that system. You're in command now, Admiral Piett.

Did you call the Zoo?
Yes, sir. We're in luck. The sick bay's almost empty except for a mauled fox cub, a deer with pneumonia, and a depressed gorilla. The Apes will be hidden from the public. They'll be quarantined. If they want medical attention, it's available on the spot. And the experts can start giving them the once-over first thing in the morning. General Brody's very pleased.

But he isn't us. He's your own kind.
He's a gorilla.
I mean he's of your race. He's an Ape. Look. You don't have to be afraid. We've put him in chains and under sedation. Do you understand that?
I should. I've been doing it half my life to Humans.

Primitive?
I mean that in our 'primitive' civilization, apes just don't talk. I mean I think it's important that, when our 'primitive' security precautions are lifted, the first time you say something in public you should talk to what we 'primitively' call the Right People.
May I say something personal?

Plissken, slow down the sub. You're overloading the power plant.
You were injected with glucose. There is no Plutoxin 7 virus. You were never going to die - at least not from anything we gave you.
C'mon, Snake - it's L.A. Everything's phony, you know that.
Who's that?
You never heard of Snake Plissken?
He doesn't look like his picture. I bet he's fake.

Come on, Cuervo. I delivered him, didn't I? All I'm asking for is what you promised.
We'll see.
Where is he?
He jumped. Down there. He's dead, Cuervo. I did it. I killed Plissken.
Give it to me.
You said I could be Vice-President, Cuervo. Your right-hand man.

Sure, Cuervo, but look here. I've done it all, man. I killed Plissken, I got your girl back, I got it all. Just for you, Cuervo. Just for you.
You're about to get hit, Cuervo. It's Plissken.
You told me he was dead.

I wouldn't be doin' that, Snake.
We have a little arrangement. Anything happens to me, you're dead.
Wait a minute. All right. Hold on.
Cuervo Jones has more firepower than two armies. No one gets near him.
Why should we leave? I love L.A. Where we gonna go? What's the payoff?
I'd like to get out but I don't have enough money.
Shit.
You always were a loser, Plissken. Makin' things up as you go along. That's why I cut out on you in Cleveland. You're just a bum like the rest of us.
Where'd you get these rigs, Carjack?
My name is Hershe Hernandez, do you understand, cowboy?
I need a favor.
What's in it for me?

Don't lie to me.

I don't know, sounds thin to me.
You want to stay here, while Cuervo Jones rules the world?

No, that sucks. How are we getting out?
No, that sucks. How are we getting out?
I don't know yet.
See you in hell, Snake.
If I'm late, Carjack, don't start without me.
She's overloaded! We're too heavy.
Somebody get off!
I think we've burned off enough fuel. We may be lighter enough to hover. Just barely.
Can you land?
Can you land?
No. The right skid's broken. If I try to set it down she'll crash. I have to stay in a hoverwhile you jump off. Hey, Carjack. We gotta hide the girl. Give her your dress.
No. The right skid's broken. If I try to set it down she'll crash. I have to stay in a hoverwhile you jump off. Hey, Carjack. We gotta hide the girl. Give her your dress.
My name is no longer Carjack. Will you please get that through your fucking head?
How you doin' Plissken? You like the watch?
You assholes didn't bring me here to give me this for 20 years of dedicated service. What'ya want?
Shut up, Plissken.

So what does this thing do?
So what does this thing do?
All you need to know is get it back here by 5 a.m.
Where do I put ashore?
Cahuenga Pass. Make your way up through the mountains toward the Hollywood Bowl. You should be able to pick up Utopia's tracer there. Once you go inside, you're on your own. You know what you have to do with the girl, don't you? We have to spare this nation her trial - for treason.

It's history. I gotta go.
Plissken - this is Malloy. Do you have the prototype?
Yeah, I got it.
Got a smoke?
You're gonna have to learn to respect the law, Snake. The United States is a no- smoking nation. No smoking, no drinking, do drugs, no women unless you're married, no guns, no foul language. It's a brand new day for you, Snake.

I give you my word. Put the prototype into my hands, and you're a free man.
Getting ready to invade.
So where's Plissken?
The prototype appears to be armed, Mr. President. Shall I begin evacuation?
Does he know how to activate it?
Does he know how to activate it?
Well, yeah. All you have to do is push the button.
Relax, war hero. We took you for a ride, and you came through. Not bad for a dirtbag like you.
You're free, Plissken. But if you even so much as break wind on a country road I'll crush you like a bug.
You're a star in your own right, you know that? Hey, I'm Map To The Stars Eddie. How you doin'?
Where'd they go?
Where'd they go?
Man, I'd love to have your autograph, Snake.
Where are they?
Who? You mean Cuervo Jones? He's the man with the juice, Snake. Got the President's daughter. Setting up a citywide truce. Big doings.
Location.
Cuervo's got a place near Venice, where the big birds fly. Nice digs, too. I've been there, y'know.
Too many people know where you're going, Snake. That's not good. Delgado and his men were back there waiting for you.
Delgado?
Delgado?
Cuervo Jones' right-hand man. One tough hombre. You don't understand, Snake. Cuervo Jones wants to unify the island. We're on the move, man. Big time.
Stop the damn car.
No way.
No way.
I said pull over.
I said pull over.
All right. Anything for you, Snake. Although I was going to take you to Cuervo Jones' place.
Where is it?
Right over there.
Where are they going?
Oh, man... You didn't have to hit me, Snake. I can help you.
Not yet.
I could've helped you. We coulda made a deal with Cuervo. If you'd listen...
Listen up. I need directions. Downtown. Somebody named Hershe.
Sure, Snake. No problem. You gonna kill me?
Sure, Snake. No problem. You gonna kill me?
Later.
Later.
I couldn't help it, Snake. I had to shoot you. Cuervo made me do it, I swear to God, man.
I couldn't help it, Snake. I had to shoot you. Cuervo made me do it, I swear to God, man.
Cease fire with the bullshit.
Cease fire with the bullshit.
Right. Keep goin' straight. Two blocks down, turn right.
How do you know all this?
I used to represent the guy who invented it. I swear to God, Snake. No bullshit.
Me too?
We'll see.
Aw, come on, Snake.
Bluebacks. I'm not bullshittin'. I swear to God.
I don't know about this thing.
Don't like it, don't come.
I got an idea, Snake. This looks like the prototype, right?
Yeah, kinda.
Yeah, kinda.
So maybe we can pull off a Texas switch on Cuervo.
So maybe we can pull off a Texas switch on Cuervo.
If he lets you get close enough.
Is that what I think it is?
Yeah. The place kept changing owners. Finally went bankrupt. That thing in Paris killed 'em.
What're you doing in here?
Looking to get out.
Looking to get out.
Good. I want you out. This is my sewer.
Good. I want you out. This is my sewer.
Which way?
Say, you need anything, Snake? Guns? Explosives? I can get you a crate of hellfire grenades, no problem - five hours.
Yeah. So how do I get to Venice?
Yeah. So how do I get to Venice?
All the sewers are collapsed under Venice. You have to go topside. Right up there.
Kind of a bad neighborhood, Snake.
Which way to the Hollywood Bowl?
Which way to the Hollywood Bowl?
Down that way.
Could be a big one comin' any minute now...
Where's... Cuervo Jones...?
Where's... Cuervo Jones...?
Long gone. You'll never catch up with him now, Snake.
Long gone. You'll never catch up with him now, Snake.
Where?
Where?
Anaheim. Headquarters for everything. The whole town's gonna be there. Things changin' fast around here, Snake. It's not the same as the old days, man.
You ain't doin' so good, Snake. You need help. You should talk to Hershe. She hates Cuervo. They used to be partners, but they split up.
Who?
Who?
Hershe. She lives downtown with Mojo Dellasandro in the big boat. Down that way.
Hi, Snake. It's so great to meet you. My name's Taslima. I'm a fan of yours.
Are you crazy?
Are you crazy?
A little bit. But pretty soon I'm gonna be dead. So are you, Snake.
What are they?
They live here, used to be like us. But after too many silicon implants, their muscles turned to jelly. The only way they survive is to have body parts transplanted over and over again. Snake, nobody who comes into Beverly Hills gets out alive.

No screamin' shit.
No screamin' shit.
Oh no, it's the Doctor.
Oh no, it's the Doctor.
Who?
Who?
The Surgeon General of Beverly Hills.
Don't follow me.
You need help.
You need help.
Like hell I do.
This is a dead end. You took us into a dead end!
I just thought you wanted to get away. I didn't know you wanted to go someplace.
Be careful of the bald cats. They live in these buildings.
The what?
How do we get out of here?
Sewers. Come on.
Snake - what is it?
How the hell am I supposed to know? This is your damn city.
Why don't you get out of L.A.? Take a boat to China, take an airplane to Brazil? Earthquakes, death, shit. Why do you stay?
I don't know. Somehow, I just can't leave.
I changed my mind. I'm going with you, wherever you're going.
What the hell is this?
What the hell is this?
The freeway.
The freeway.
I know that. There are people in some of these cars.
I know that. There are people in some of these cars.
It's where they live. I guess after everything happened, they just needed to do what they'd always done before. During the daytime, they just pull down the shades on their windows and sleep.
What are you gonna do in Venice?
Find Cuervo Jones.
Find Cuervo Jones.
No! Stay away, Snake. He's mucho muerte.
Run, Snake...They're coming.
Who?
I can see you're real concerned about your daughter.
Utopia is lost to me. My daughter is gone.
Utopia is lost to me. My daughter is gone.
Well, I'll think it over.
Well, I'll think it over.
You're running out of time.
You're running out of time.
I've been doin' that all my life. Might as well do it in L.A. Everybody else there is.
Get ready, shitheads. We're comin' in.
Thank God.
Where's the anti-toxin...?
Give me the prototype.
Hey, what's going down, Snake?
I'm looking for somebody.
I'm looking for somebody.
Who ain't?
You owe me. You left me holdin' everything back there in Cleveland.
Hershe, you were in Cleveland?
Hershe, you were in Cleveland?
Yeah. With me and Texas Mike O'Shay.
All of us?
Yeah.
The President's promised to give whoever helps me 1 million dollars.
Yeah? Greenbacks? I got ten million of them.
Yeah? Greenbacks? I got ten million of them.
Uh-uh. Bluebacks.
Is he coming?
He heard Lady Guenevere's request and he said nothing. That is all.
In the name of God, of St. Michael, and St. George, I make you a knight. Rise, Sir...
...Perceval!
There is one thing left to do... Excalibur... And you must do it, Perceval. Leave my wounds, I command you.
I cannot--
I cannot--
--Take Excalibur. Find a pool of calm water and throw the sword into it.
When you threw it in, what did you see?
...I saw nothing.
My King, I couldn't do it. Excalibur cannot be lost. Other men--
--By itself it is only a piece of steel. Its power comes from he who wields it. For now there is no one. Do as I have ordered!
Good day to you, sir.
Move aside. This is the King's road, and the knights you joined arms against were his very own.
Move aside. This is the King's road, and the knights you joined arms against were his very own.
I await the King himself. His knights are in need of training.
I await the King himself. His knights are in need of training.
I am King, and this is Excalibur, sword of kings from the dawn of time. Who are you, and why do you block the way?
I am King, and this is Excalibur, sword of kings from the dawn of time. Who are you, and why do you block the way?
I am Sir Lancelot of the Lake, from across the sea. I am the best knight in the whole of Christiandom, and I look for the king who is worthy of my sword's service.

--That is a wild boast. You lack a knight's humility.
--That is a wild boast. You lack a knight's humility.
Not a boast, sir, but a curse. Never have I met my match in joust or duel.
Not a boast, sir, but a curse. Never have I met my match in joust or duel.
Move aside!
Move aside!
I will not. You must retreat or prove your kingship in the test of arms, under the eyes of God.
Yield. I have the advantage.
I will not.
Fight me from your horse or on foot, but fight me. Your avoidance mocks me.
I sought only not to harm you, sir.
Sir, your rage has unbalanced you. It seems you would fight to the death against a knight who is not your enemy, for a length of road you can ride around.
So be it, to the death.
So be it, to the death.
It is you, sir, who knows not the virtue of humility, as a true king must.
Thanks to God, you are alive.
I, the best knight in the world, bested! This is a great day, for my search is over. I love you, my King.
You are still the best knight in Christiandom. You gained a hundred advantages over me. It is I who must love you, for through your courage and patience you taught me a bitter lesson.
Then make me your champion and I will always fight in your place.
Then make me your champion and I will always fight in your place.
But your life and lands are far from here.
But your life and lands are far from here.
I gave up my castles and my lands!
My domain is here, inside this metal skin. And I would pledge to you all that I still own: muscle, bone, blood and the heart that pumps it.
And a great heart it is. Sir Lancelot, you will be my champion.
Lancelot, how did you fare in the North?
We spared the lives of a few, so they could sail home and tell their fellows what fate they met at the hands of King Arthur's knights...
These men repented before God for their evil deeds. Those who would not, met their fate at the end of my sword. Accept the fruit of my first quest as my wedding gift.
I do. Rise, Lancelot, come with me.
Your deeds set an example for all other knights. For your gift, ask a gift of me.
Only give me leave to ride out again, to do what I am most able to do, and happiest doing.
They miss the battlefield. I think we do too.
But one can still keep a sword sharp riding out in the name of the King's law.
Hasn't Merlin mended your wound?
It is deep...
Arthur.
Lancelot, I will save you... Don't die.
My salvation is to die a Knight of the Round Table.
You are that and much more. You are its greatest knight, you are what is best in men. Now we will be together--
You are that and much more. You are its greatest knight, you are what is best in men. Now we will be together--
--It is the old wound, that has been opened. I have always known it would be the gateway to my death, for it has never healed. Let my heart do its job, my King, and pump me empty...
At last...
Don't recognize him. You were trapped by Morgana's sorcery.
Don't recognize him. You were trapped by Morgana's sorcery.
...Gawain and Perceval, Bors and Bohort, Caradoc and Ector, and all the others--lost to me. Only the echo of their voices remains in this empty hall. All I have left is the memory of their fellowship. Echoes and memories. I am a ghost of the King that once was... ...Mordred is real, alive, my own flesh and blood. I will see him, I must.
Perceval, you have returned!
Ready my knights for battle; they will ride with their King once more. I have lived through others far too long! Lancelot carried my honor and Guenevere my guilt. My knights have fought my causes. Mordred carries my sins. Now, at last, I will rule.
Merlin, will I live...? ...I was dreaming...
Of Merlin?
Of Merlin?
Yes. He spoke to me. He said I would fight bravely tomorrow. I have never dreamed of Merlin before.
Yes. He spoke to me. He said I would fight bravely tomorrow. I have never dreamed of Merlin before.
I dreamed of him too... Merlin lives! He lives in our dreams now, in that dark and shadowy place that is as strong and real as this more solid one. He speaks to us from there.
He can be no other.
Lancelot?... It is Lancelot!
Who is Merlin?
Speak of the devil!...
Whose son am I?
You are the son of King Uther, and the fair Igrayne... you are King Arthur.
You saved me from the arrow...
But not from your destiny.
But not from your destiny.
I want to thank you.
I want to thank you.
That's not why you came.
Merlin, help me. I need your help. I don't know how--
'Help me, Help me.' Help me get up.
It is whispered in the forest that... ...Leondegrance's castle is under siege by Lot and Uryens.
Yes, yes, I know that. Everybody does. Lord Leondegrance is my only ally among the barons and the great knights. I can't lose him.
Yes, yes, I know that. Everybody does. Lord Leondegrance is my only ally among the barons and the great knights. I can't lose him.
Well there. You don't need me half as much as you think you do. You already know what must not happen.
Well there. You don't need me half as much as you think you do. You already know what must not happen.
I must find the means to save him, then. I was hoping I could ask you for a little magic help, but if it makes you so tired...
I must find the means to save him, then. I was hoping I could ask you for a little magic help, but if it makes you so tired...
Thank you.
It's just that I have no experience, and no men to speak of. How can I--
Because you must! You and only you. Have you forgotten that it was you who freed Excalibur?
How? Where?
In the great book.
In the great book.
What book is that?
What book is that?
The book without pages. Open before you, all around us. You can see it in bits and pieces, for if mortal men were to see it whole and all complete in a single glance, why, it would burn him to cinders.

What?!
What?!
The dragon! There...
Then as knight to knight I can offer you mercy.
What's this, what's this?!
A king must marry, after all.
...of course...
I love her. If she would be my queen, my dreams would be answered.
There are maidens as fair, and fairer than Guenevere. If I put my mind to it, I could see them now, many of them, weeping for love of you, watching the hills for you coming from the high towers of their castles. Offering you their every favor. Rich, clever--but if it is to be Guenevere, so be it.
Who will it be? Put your mind to it, then.
Guenevere. And a beloved friend who will betray you.
Guenevere. And a beloved friend who will betray you.
Guenevere...
Guenevere...
You're not listening. Your heart is not. Love is deaf as well as blind.
I should have left you to fend for yourself.
I had to weave a little enchantment on the bees so I could get some honey, and I didn't feel up to using any more magic just yet. Anyway, I was in less danger than you'll be in today.
So you were stealing their honey. They should have killed you.
Come now. So much anger for such a little crime? Are you sure there is nothing else troubling you?
Come now. So much anger for such a little crime? Are you sure there is nothing else troubling you?
You know full well there is, and I go to meet it now. Come witness my revenge.
Excalibur! Is it true?
The Lady of the Lake. Take it. Take it, quickly!
The knights of Galys approach the camp. It would be politic...
...to ride out and meet them.
At your service, sir.
Then answer me this. For years peace has reigned in the land. Crops grow in abundance, there is no want. Every one of my subjects enjoys his portion of happiness and justice, even those whose tiresome misunderstandings we must resolve here each day. Tell me, Merlin: have we defeated evil, as it seems?

Every one of my subjects enjoys his portion of happiness and justice, even those whose tiresome misunderstandings we must resolve here each day. Tell me, Merlin: have we defeated evil, as it seems?
Good and evil; there is never one without the other.
Where hides evil, then, in my kingdom?
Never where you expect it, that's all I know.
Merlin, tell me. Now that Guenevere is returned to me...
What is it my child?
Yes.
Just yes? No mad laughter, no riddles, nothing but a simple yes? That frightens me.
Just yes? No mad laughter, no riddles, nothing but a simple yes? That frightens me.
A king should be afraid, always. The enemy is everywhere. Waiting in ambush in the dark corridors of his castle, on the deer paths of his forest, or in the gray and winding paths of a more tangled forest, in here.
What? The greatest? They blend together like the metals we mix to make a good sword.
I didn't ask for poetry. Which is it?
I am alone and betrayed. By my wife, by my beloved friend, by my knights. And by you. Perhaps most of all by you. For you made me, you forged this wretched life. And like a child tired of a toy, you toss me aside, a babbling lecher trotting after my sister...
That is my destiny. I have a destiny, too...
That is my destiny. I have a destiny, too...
With all your powers, you are content to be ridiculed, laughed at...
With all your powers, you are content to be ridiculed, laughed at...
My powers fade, Arthur. I resort to cheap tricks... Yes! I enjoy every moment of my foolishness, I join in the making of it, so no one can betray me. But you! You betray yourself.
My powers fade, Arthur. I resort to cheap tricks... Yes! I enjoy every moment of my foolishness, I join in the making of it, so no one can betray me. But you! You betray yourself.
Me? I have lived by the oath of king and knight.
Me? I have lived by the oath of king and knight.
You betray the boy who drew the sword, the boy who saw the Dragon... the Dragon who moves close by, coiling and uncoiling, restless, looking down, waiting for the King to be a king...
I must do it myself. I must kill them both. Lancelot and Guenevere. Will you ride with me, Merlin?
I cannot. I must not. Here I must stay.
Quiet. You'll wake the men, and they must fight tomorrow for their very lives.
I know. I have heard noises and echoes through the stones...
I know. I have heard noises and echoes through the stones...
What is this place, Merlin?
What is this place, Merlin?
It is like a tree. The roots of the stones spread out across the land and they draw on the thoughts and actions of men. Like sap those human matters course through the stones feeding the stars that are the leaves of the tree. And the stars whisper back to men the future course of events. But the earth is being torn apart, its
But, I'm here.
Where have you been these many years? Is it true that Morgana--
Where have you been these many years? Is it true that Morgana--
--Stories... You brought me back. Your love brought me back. Back to where you are now, in the land of dreams...
--Stories... You brought me back. Your love brought me back. Back to where you are now, in the land of dreams...
Is this a dream? Tell me, Merlin!
Father...
Rise, Mordred.
Rise, Mordred.
I have come to claim what is mine, Father.
I have come to claim what is mine, Father.
I recognize you only as my son, no more.
I recognize you only as my son, no more.
And you are the great King? The lords have rebelled. Invaders attack the coasts. Crops don't grow. There is nothing but plague and hunger in the land. Only I am feared. I will be king. You may have lost Excalibur, but I have found my own weapon of power. There.
The very spear that pierced the side of Christ as he died on the cross.
Your mother told you that?
I cannot offer you the land, only my love...
And I offer only this, Father. To commit with passion and pleasure all the evils that you failed to commit, as man and king.
I will muster a great force of knights, and I will return to fight for what is mine.
So be it.
I left it in the tent, sir.
Well hurry then, and get it.
Sir... Kay needed a sword. His was stolen. I saw Excalibur, and... I took it.
You freed it, son?
You freed it, son?
I did, Father. I beg your forgiveness.
Who is, then?
I don't know. Merlin brought you to me when you were newly born and charged me to raise you as my own. At first, I did so because I feared Merlin, later because I loved you.
He is the mightiest and fairest of knights.
We fought and won battles, and now one man defeats all my knights? I will go.
It didn't hurt too much, did it?
Ye...
Ye...
--I'm pretty good at stitchery. I've sewn my father's wounds more than once.
But I have to leave tomorrow. The forests are thick with rebels, invaders plunder our shores...
--And damsels in besieged castles are waiting to be rescued?
--And damsels in besieged castles are waiting to be rescued?
I didn't know Leondegrance had a daughter.
I didn't know Leondegrance had a daughter.
Well, then, I shall tell you which knights have maiden daughters, so you can avoid their castles.
No, I think it's better if you just stay here to heal. At least a week.
I'm going.
I'm going.
Quiet, or I'll sew up your mouth too.
He must stay for the feasting days of our wedding, and tell his deeds himself.
I grant you your wish if you grant Lady Guenevere hers.
I will ride with Sir Kay. Lancelot, rest here.
Don't start a war on my wedding day!
Don't start a war on my wedding day!
Without Lancelot?!
Sir Gahalt, answer the Queen.
No. I meant not to be angry with you, Sir Gahalt. In the idleness that comes with peace gossip has bread its own evil. You merely repeat it. Please, sir, have one of those apples that Lancelot loves, and in that gesture partake of its goodness.
The Queen will be in my charge till a champion steps forward to fight on her behalf.
Not you, my husband?
Why can't you be my champion?
If I am your judge, I cannot be your champion. When I act as your King, I cannot be your husband.
If I am your judge, I cannot be your champion. When I act as your King, I cannot be your husband.
And you cannot love me...
And you cannot love me...
The laws, my laws, must bind everyone, high and low, or they are not laws at all. Lancelot will come...
The laws, my laws, must bind everyone, high and low, or they are not laws at all. Lancelot will come...
And if he cannot be found, no other knight will champion me, though you beseeched each and every one of them. Why be king if there is no one you can call loyal subject but an eager boy?
I loved you much, as King, and sometimes as husband, but one cannot gaze too long at the sun in the sky.
Forgive me, my wife, if you can. I was not born to live a man's life, but to be the stuff of future memory. The fellowship was a brief beginning, a fair time that cannot be forgotten; and because it will not be forgotten, that fair time may come again. Now once more I must ride with my knights to defend what was, and

Now once more I must ride with my knights to defend what was, and
I have kept it.
Who does it serve?
You, my lord.
You, my lord.
I have waited long for you. Once you almost saw, but fear blinded you. Why am I served from the chalice?
I have waited long for you. Once you almost saw, but fear blinded you. Why am I served from the chalice?
Because you and the land are one.

I am wasting away and I cannot die. And I cannot live.
You and the land are one. Drink from the chalice. You will be reborn and the land with you.
The well-kept secret is whether any of them has won your heart.
No.
No.
Why?
Why?
I am a fighting man and I am married to the quest. That is enough.
I am a fighting man and I am married to the quest. That is enough.

Who?!

You.
You.
Me?
Me?
Yes. I would swear my love to you.
Yes. I would swear my love to you.
To me? But why?
To me? But why?
I cannot love as a woman the lady who will be wife to my King and my friend. And, in pledging my love to you, I cannot love any other woman.
The law forbids it.
Love demands it.
There are things about love--
--Nothing!
Why didn't he kill us?
He has given up.
The King without his sword, the land without a king...
We are to blame.
Just a man. A knight in the King's service.
You're a man?! ...with metal skin!
Very well. Climb up.
I will run.
I will run.
Listen, boy, it's more than twenty days from here.
Listen, boy, it's more than twenty days from here.
Twenty days!? The world is that big?
I have found you. The Queen. An apple. Tomorrow. Sir Gawain...
--It must wait, child. These good ladies, for whom I intervened once, will honor me with a meal. I am beholden to them now as I was when they begged my protection.
You left your husband's side? You left your brother's wedding?
Is that Mandrake, Lord Merlin?
Is that Mandrake, Lord Merlin?
It is.
It is.
Can it truly be used for magic?
No, no, of course not. You are young...
I'm not jealous!
I'm not jealous!
It's clear you are, and it irks me.
It's clear you are, and it irks me.
No. Yes, I am. I am jealous. I want to write poems about you with moonbeams, make the sea sing your name...
No. Yes, I am. I am jealous. I want to write poems about you with moonbeams, make the sea sing your name...
A lovestruck page!
A lovestruck page!
Shh... yes, yes. Sit with me, please... Morgana.
I showed you all my conjuring tricks...
The deepest secrets, the forbidden formulas...
The deepest secrets, the forbidden formulas...
Maybe... maybe...
You know what I want. I want the secret of true magic, how to thicken the stuff of dreams and wishes with the flesh of the world.
That I cannot.
When Arthur built the castle, I carved out a place for myself, where I could laugh or sleep, and no one would bother me.
People make you laugh?
They do.
Why?
You are truly magnificent!
Flattery! Do you think I am ignorant of your stupid little games? Preying on you weakness of others. That's your power, a petty evil. Mine is great. Great plans. Impossible dreams. Laughable endings...
Merlin, the powers of Summoning, the true Name of the charms of Doing and Undoing. Show me!
I won't. You would misuse such power. I have paid enough for you, and I will have you.
What do you want? You must desire it for me to weave it.
Walls of shining crystals, burning with red fire, furnishings of metals and jewels never seen by man...
You provoke me, Merlin.
What's behind that beauty? A wizened, cold-hearted snake.
I am the cloudburst that quenches the flames.
I am the desert, where water disappears--
I am the desert, where water disappears--
--I am the sea, which covers the desert forever under its weight.
--I am the sea, which covers the desert forever under its weight.
--I am the fog and mists that rise up from the sea, escaping...
It's done. A truce. We meet at the river.
Talk. Lovers murmuring to each other...
I should butcher all and every one of them. Merlin, what is this wagging of tongues?
Just show the sword.
Behold the sword of power, Excalibur. Before Uther, it belonged to Lud, before Lud, to Beowulf, before Beowulf to Baldur the Good, before Baldur to Thor himself and that was when the world was young and there were more than seven colors in the rainbow. Speak the words.
One land, one king! That is my peace!
I have walked my way since the beginning of time. Sometimes I give, sometimes I take. It is mine to know which, and when.
Dumb riddles, Merlin. I am your King.
I swear it. By Excalibur and the holy--
--What issues from your lust will be mine. Swear it again.
--What issues from your lust will be mine. Swear it again.
I swear it.
Merlin! Out of the sick sleep at last.
Doing what I did for you, it wasn't easy, you know. It takes it's toll. It took nine moons to get back my strength.
Now you must pay me.
I?
I?
The child is mine, Uther. I have come for him.
The oath. You didn't say--
You didn't ask!
It's not for you, Uther, hearth and home, wife and child.

They are not weapons, my friend, but truths. You betrayed the Duke, stole his wife and took his castle, now no one trusts you. Lot, Uryens, your allies will turn against you. Give me the child, Uther, I will protect him. Go back to your war tent.
Burke take a look at this damn thing it just doesn't make sense.

Ten maybe twelve years ago, in Africa. The exorcism supposedly lasted for months. I heard it damn near killed him.
You're convinced that it's genuine.
I don't know. No, not really I suppose. But I've made a prudent judgement that it meets the conditions set down in the Ritual.

Quite frankly, we don't know much about it except that it's starts with some conflict or guilt that eventually leads to the patient's delusion that his body's been invaded by an alien intellegence; a spirit if you will.
Look, I'm telling you again and you'd better believe it, I'm not about to put her in a goddamn asylum!
Look, I'm telling you again and you'd better believe it, I'm not about to put her in a goddamn asylum!

And I don't care what you call it! I'm not putting her away!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
You're sorry. Christ, eighty-eight doctors and all you can tell me is all of your bullshit...
It's a stylized ritual in which rabbis or priests try to drive out the so-called invading spirit. It's pretty much discarded these days, except by the Catholics who keep it in the closet as a sort of embarrassment. It has worked, in fact, although not for the reason they think, of course. It was purely the force of suggestion. The victim's belief in possession
You're telling me that, I should take my daughter to a witch doctor? Is that it?
Hello?
In here!
Hi
Hi, how'd your day go?
Hi, how'd your day go?
Oh not to bad, kinda like the Walt Disney version of the Ho Chi Minh story, but other than that it was terrific.
Here.
Oh great, anything else?

And you got an invitation.

Just five or six people.
Just five or six people.
No kidding.
Hello? Yes this is Mrs. MacNeil. Operator you have got to be kidding I have been on this line for twenty minutes. Jesus Christ, can you believe this, he doesn't even call his daughter on her birthday for christ sake.
Maybe the circuit is busy?

Oh circuit my ass, he doesn't give a shit!

Why don't you let me?
What the hell do you mean going out and leaving Regan by her self! What are you kidding her window's wide open...
What didn't he tell you?

Didn't who tell me?

Yeah, well I guess you should've.
What did the doctor say?
We have to start looking for a shrink.
Oh Burke! Poor Burke!
I can't believe it.
This was under Regan's pillow. Did you put it there?
Of course I didn't.
Where do you want this?
What is it?
What is it?
Phonograph.
Phonograph.
Storage.
I'm gonna miss you.
Me too.
Me too.
Sure you won't change your mind?
Does your daughter remember if perhaps Mr. Dennings was in her room in her room that night?
No, she was heavily sedated.
No, she was heavily sedated.
It's serious?

Yes, I'm affraid it is.

May I ask...?

We still don't know.

Watch out for drafts. A draft in the fall when the house is hot is a magic carpet for bacteria.
Strange...strange...so baffling. The deceased comes to visit, stays only twenty minutes, and leaves all alone a very sick girl. And speaking plainly Mrs. MacNeil, as you say, it's not likely he would fall from a window. Besides that, a fall wouldn't do to his neck what we found except maybe a chance in a thousand. My hunch? My opinion? I believe he was killed
No. Not at all,
No. Not at all,
You were expecting a deliver y that day?

Oh, I see.

Want to ask him?
Want to ask him?
Never mind.
Would you like some more coffee?
Please.
Incidentally, just a chance in a million, I know; but your daughter - you could possibly ask her if she saw Mr. Dennings in her room that night?
Look, he wouldn't have any reason to be up there in the first place.
Look, he wouldn't have any reason to be up there in the first place.

Couldn't hurt. In the meantime...
I hate to ask you this but... for my daughter could you maybe give an autograph?
Of course. Have you got a pen?
Oh, she'd love it.
What's her name?
I lied. It's for me. The spelling is on the back, Kinderman. You know that film you made called Angel? Isaw that six times.
Really? wow.
Thank you.
You're a nice man.
Good morning Madame.
Good morning Karl. Oh Karl, we've got rats in the attic you better get some traps.

Uh huh. 'Fraid so.
But it's clean?
All right then we've got clean rats.
No. No rats.
I just heard them Karl.
Yeah or maybe rats now will you just get those traps.
Yes, I go now.
Yes, I go now.
Well don't go now Karl the stores aren't open yet.
There is nothing.
Oh Karl, Jesus Christ Karl, don't do that.
Oh Karl, Jesus Christ Karl, don't do that.
Very sorry, but you see, no rats!
Very sorry, but you see, no rats!
No rats. Thanks a lot that's terrific.
Bastard! I will kill you.

Karl? Did you put this in Regan's bedroom?
She is going to be well?

Karl if you put this in Regan's room I want you to tell me, now did you?
Karl if you put this in Regan's room I want you to tell me, now did you?

Excuse me Miss?
What!

A man to see you.

Excuse me Madame? Will there be anything else?
No thanks Karl.
Morning.
Good morning Mrs. MacNeil.
Good morning Mrs. MacNeil.
How are you today?
How are you today?
Fine thank you.
Fine thank you.
That's good.
Is it coming out Willie?
Yes, I think so.
A disorder of the nerves. At least we think it is. We don't know yet exactly how it works, but it's often seen in earl adolescence. She shows all the symptoms: the hyperactivity; the temper; her performance in math.
Why the math?
Why the math?
It affects concentration.
Now this is for Ritalin. Ten miligrams a day.
What is it? A tranquilizer?
What is it? A tranquilizer?
A stimulant.
A stimulant.
Stimulant? She's higher than a kite right now!
Stimulant? She's higher than a kite right now!
Her condition isn't quite what it seems. Nobody knows the cause of her hyperkinetic behaviour in a child. The Ritalin sems to work to relieve the condition, but we really don't know how or why, frankly. Your daughter's symptoms could be an overreaction to depression- but that's out of my field.

Do you think I should take her to see a psychiatrist?

Well, I'd say her vocabulary's rather extensive.

Well, what, for example? I mean, give me a for instance!
Hey, come on, I'm grown-up. What'd she say? I mean specifically, Doctor.
Well, specifically, Mrs. MacNeil, she advised me to keep my fingers away from her goddam cunt.

The best explanation is always the simplest one. Let's wait. Let's wait and see. In the meantime try not to worry.
Well, It's a symptom of a type of desturbance in the chemico- electrical activity of the brain. In the case of your daughter in the temperal lobe, up here in the lateral part of the brain. It's rare, but it does cause bizarre hallucinations and usually just before a convulsion.
Convulsion?
Convulsion?
The shaking of the bed, that's doubtless due to musuclar spasms.
The shaking of the bed, that's doubtless due to musuclar spasms.
Oh no, that was no spasm. I got on the bed, the whole bed was thumping and rising off the floor and shaking. The whole thing, with me on it!
Oh no, that was no spasm. I got on the bed, the whole bed was thumping and rising off the floor and shaking. The whole thing, with me on it!
Mrs. MacNeil the problem with your daughter is not her bed, it's her brain.
So, what causes this?
Lesion, Lesion in the temperal lobe. It's a kind of seizure disorder.

Look doc, I really don't understand how her whole personality could change.

The temperal lobe is very common. Could last for days, even weeks. It isn't rare to find destructive or even criminal behaviour.

Hey do me a favour will ya'. Tell me something good.

Don't be alarmed. If it's a lesion in a way she's fortunate. All we have to do is remove the scar.
She's heavily sedated. She'll probably sleep through tomorrow.
What was going on in there, how could she jump off the bed like that?
We still think the temporal lobe...
Oh. What are you talking about for Christ sake! Did you see her or not? She's acting like a fucking out of her mind psychotic or a split personality or...
Do you keep any drugs in your house?
No. Of course not, nothing like that.
No. Of course not, nothing like that.

Please go away.

Oh, I'm very sorry Father. Hi.
That's okay. I should've told you I wouldn't be in uniform.
That's okay. I should've told you I wouldn't be in uniform.
Yeah, it would've helped. Have you gotta cigarette Father?
So, how'd a shrink ever get to be a priest?

Oh yeah, since when?

Since we learned about mental illness, paranoia, schizophrenia. All the things they taught me in Harvard. Mrs. MacNeil since the day I joined the Jesuits, I've never met one priest who has performed an exorcism, not one.

Yeah well, it just so happens that somebody very close to me is probably possessed, and needs an exorcist.
That's all the more reason to forget about exorcism.
Why, I don't understand?

Nothing you could do would make it any worse.

I thought you were supposed to be an expert.
There are no experts. You probably know as much about possession than most priests. Look your daughter doesn't say she's a demon, she says she's the devil himself and if you've seen as many psychotics as I have, you'd know it's like saying you're Napoleon Bonaparte. You ask me what I think is best for your daughter. Six months, under observation in the best

You show me Regan's double: same face, same voice, same everything. I'd know it wasn't Regan. I'd know in my gut and I'm telling you that that thing upstairs isn't my daughter! And I want you to tell me that you know for a fact that there's nothing wrong with my daughter except in her mind! You tell me you know for a fact

Well I think you should.
I told Regan that was holy water, I sprinkled some on her and she reacted very violently. It's tap water.
What's the difference?
What's the difference?
Holy water's blessed. And that doesn't help support a case for possession.
She...killed Burke Dennings.

Pathological states can induce abnormal strength, accelerated motor performance. For example, a ninety-pound women sees her child pinned under the wheel of a truck, runs out and lifts the wheels half a foot up off the ground. You know the story, same thing here. Same principle, I mean.
So what's wrong with her?
There haven't been more than a hundred authenticated cases of so- called split personality, Mrs. MacNeil. Now I know the temptation is to leap to psychiatry, but any reasonable psychiatrist would exhaust the somatic possibilities first.

Why?
We may ask what is relevant, but anything beyond that is dangerous. He is a liar, the demon is a liar. He will lie to confuse us. But he will also mix lies with the truth to attack us. The attack is psychological , Damien. And powerful. So don't listen, remember that, do not listen.
I think it would be helpful if I gave you some background on the different personalities Regan has manifested. So far, there seems to be three. She's convinced-

Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day, our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation.
But deliver us from the evil one.
Save me o' God by thy name, by thy might defend my cause, proud men have risen up against me, men of violence seek my life, but God is my helper, the Lord sustains my life and every need he has delivered to me, glory be to the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.

I thought maybe twenty percent. Look, with the additional bookings we'll come out ahead. The big hotels, they want a pretty girl with a big voice. We have to stay competitive, Jack.

Ma? Ma? Was Ma there the last time we played the Ambassador? Oh, that's right, she was on bass. How could I forget.
How many other silent partners are there, Frank? Donna? Little Cindy? Hell, let's give Eddie a vote.
Okay, okay. I'll call the girl.

How about these?

Jack, for crying out loud. Your bachelorhood's showing. Ah, here we go.
Oh, brother.
And it's especially nice to be among friends tonight, because, well, tonight's a very special night for my brother and I. This evening we've asked a young lady to join us, a lady Jack and I are sure will soon seem like just another old friend to you all. She's making her debut here this evening and, as far as I'm concerned, she couldn't
Sounds like a booking agent looking to book an easy fee.
That's what I figure. Probably have us in a bed-and-breakfast playing to the owls.
Make it collect.
That's it except for the first. We got the Sheraton, the Ambassador, or the Holiday Inn on Sixtieth. All three-day turns.
Better take care of your fingers, little brother. Buy yourself a case of arthritis and you won't be able to play 'Chopsticks.'
I'll take my chances.
Something, huh? All those bids.
Yeah. Something.
Yeah. Something.
Yeah ... Well, I gotta go.
Yeah ... Well, I gotta go.

Very realistic.

Yeah, well, what can I say? Dad must've had forty pounds on me. Jesus, you remember him being this big?
Yeah.
Well, the line's growing weaker, little brother. Lucky for us there aren't any dragons left to slay.
You want to come out to the house tomorrow? The way the bookings been piling up, Donna's decided to really lay it on. Turkey, stuffing, the whole bit. Kitchen's so full of food you can hardly move. We could use another appetite.
Thanks, but I've got plans.
Thanks, but I've got plans.
All right, but if you change your mind, let me know. I gotta go get Ma in the morning anyway.

Doesn't it matter to you?

What matters to me is we've got the six easiest nights we've had in ten years. So 'Tie a Yellow Ribbon' sounds a little flat. So what? Nobody's gonna hear it, Jack. Nobody. So why should you care?

Well, then stuff cotton in your ears, because come six o'clock we're gonna walk into that dining room with smiles on. Understand, little brother?
Thank you, thank you. You know, Susie and Jack and I only just arrived here yesterday, but already the people here at the King Corporation's Moorish Manor have made us feel, well, a part of the family. And it's their hope that, before you leave, everyone of you will feel a part of that family also. So, if during-the next few days, we should

Dedications. I came up with the idea on the road. See, every morning the maids drop one of these cards in each room. The guest fills out the card, leaves it at the front desk, and that night we play it. Daniels went crazy for the idea. And that's not all. Last night, after the nine o'clock, he corners me, right, and starts asking
Funny, huh?
What?
What?
Thinking there's someone who looks like you, walking around the street somewhere. Wonder if I saw him I'd think it was you?
What're you trying to do? Wake up the whole goddamn hotel?

Expensive hangover.
A gift. Courtesy of our courteous hotel manager, Mr. Daniels. We, dear brother, are a fucking smash. Yup. They want us back. Easter. It seems they have this egg hunt every year. Only not for kids.

Drove me crazy when we were kids. The way you never looked at the music. Miss Simpson would just play it and ...
They were simple songs.
Not for me. I still have to look at the music sometimes, you know that? Otherwise, I forget. I just forget. But you. You never forget. Ever. So how come you couldn't remember Ma's birthday?

It wasn't professional, Jack. It was a stunt. A stupid-ass stunt.
What's happening to you, Frank? You been kissing ass so long you're starting to like it? You let that guy turn us into clowns tonight. We were always small time, but we were never clowns, Frank. What's happened to your dignity?
Dignity? Who the hell are you to talk about dignity?
Stay off it.
No, let's stay on it. I'm sick and tired of watching you make him up into some kinda god. For Christ sake, Jack, he died doing a stupid bullshit jig. He left a wife and two sons. He wasn't a hero. He was a fool.

Oh ... I was just hoping for something to drink. But it seems the old lady was dry. Not even a bottle of cooking sherry.
Uh, we already boxed some things. I figured you'd want to go through Dad's stuff. It's in there. If you want to get started.
Later.
Is everything done? The arrangements, I mean.
