And I said I would never leave you.
And you never will. But I've got a job to do, too. Where I'm going you can't follow. What I've got to do you can't be any part of. Ilsa, I'm no good at being noble, but it doesn't take much to see that the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world. Someday you'll understand
Yes.
She tried everything to get them, and nothing worked. She did her best to convince me that she was still in love with me, but that was all over long ago. For your sake, she pretended it wasn't, and I let her pretend.
Hello, Sam.
Hello, Miss Ilsa. I never expected to see you again.
It's been a long time.
Yes, ma'am. A lot of water under the bridge.
Yes, ma'am. A lot of water under the bridge.
Some of the old songs, Sam.
Some of the old songs, Sam.
Yes, ma'am.
Where is Rick?
I don't know. I ain't seen him all night.
When will he be back?
Not tonight no more. He ain't coming. Uh, he went home.
Not tonight no more. He ain't coming. Uh, he went home.
Does he always leave so early?
Does he always leave so early?
Oh, he never... well... he's got a girl up at the Blue Parrot. He goes up there all the time.
Oh, he never... well... he's got a girl up at the Blue Parrot. He goes up there all the time.
You used to be a much better liar, Sam.
You used to be a much better liar, Sam.
Leave him alone, Miss Ilsa. You're bad luck to him.
Leave him alone, Miss Ilsa. You're bad luck to him.
Play it once, Sam, for old time's sake.
Play it once, Sam, for old time's sake.
I don't know what you mean, Miss Ilsa.
I don't know what you mean, Miss Ilsa.
Play it, Sam. Play "As Time Goes By."
Play it, Sam. Play "As Time Goes By."
Oh I can't remember it, Miss Ilsa. I'm a little rusty on it.
Victor, I, I feel somehow we shouldn't stay here.
If we would walk out so soon, it would only call attention to us. Perhaps Ugarte's in some other part of the cafe.
You are very kind.
Won't you join us?
This time they really mean to stop me.
Victor, I'm afraid for you.
Victor, I'm afraid for you.
We have been in difficult places before, haven't we?
I must find out what Berger knows.
Be careful.
Be careful.
I will, don't worry.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
We are only interested in two visas, Signor.
Please, Ilsa, don't be hasty.
Please, Ilsa, don't be hasty.
No, Victor, no.
No, Ilsa, I won't let you stay here. You must get to America. And believe me, somehow I will get out and join you.
But, Victor, if the situation were different, if I had to stay and there were only a visa for one, would you take it?
But, Victor, if the situation were different, if I had to stay and there were only a visa for one, would you take it?
Yes, I would.
Yes, I see. When I had trouble getting out of Lille, why didn't you leave me there? And when I was sick in Marseilles and held you up for two weeks and you were in danger every minute of the time, why didn't you leave me then?
I meant to, but something always held me up. I love you very much, Ilsa.
He does. Could we have a table close to him?
And as far away from Major Strasser as possible.
What happened with Rick?
We'll discuss it later.
Our faithful friend is still there.
Victor, please, don't go to the underground meeting tonight.
Victor, please, don't go to the underground meeting tonight.
I must. Besides, it isn't often that a man has a chance to display heroics before his wife.
Don't joke. After Major Strasser's warning tonight, I am frightened.
To tell you the truth, I am frightened too. Shall I remain here in our hotel room hiding, or shall I carry on the best I can?
Whatever I'd say, you'd carry on. Victor, why don't you tell me about Rick? What did you find out?
Apparently he has the letters.
Apparently he has the letters.
Yes?
Yes?
But no intention of selling them. One would think if sentiment wouldn't persuade him, money would.
Did he give any reason?
He suggested I ask you.
He suggested I ask you.
Ask me?
Ask me?
Yes. He said, "Ask your wife." I don't know why he said that.
Ilsa, I --
-- Yes?
-- Yes?
When I was in the concentration camp, were you lonely in Paris?
Yes, Victor, I was.
I know how it is to be lonely. Is there anything you wish to tell me?
I know how it is to be lonely. Is there anything you wish to tell me?
No, Victor, there isn't.
No, Victor, there isn't.
I love you very much, my dear.
Yes, Yes I know. Victor, whatever I do, will you believe that I, that --
-- You don't even have to say it. I'll believe. Goodnight, dear.
Be careful.
Of course, I'll be careful.
Are you ready Ilsa?
Yes, I'm ready. Goodbye, Rick. God bless you.
Captain, the boy who is playing the piano, somewhere I have seen him.
Sam?
Sam?
Yes.
Yes.
He came from Paris with Rick.
He came from Paris with Rick.
Rick? Who's he?
Rick? Who's he?
Mademoiselle, you are in Rick's and Rick is --
Mademoiselle, you are in Rick's and Rick is --
-- Is what?
-- Is what?
Well, Mademoiselle, he's the kind of a man that, well, if I were a woman and I... were not around, I should be in love with Rick. But what a fool I am talking to a beautiful woman about another man.
Hello, Rick.
Oh, you've already met Rick, Mademoiselle?
Well then, perhaps you also ---
-- This is Mr. Laszlo.
I can't get over you two. She was asking about you earlier, Rick, in a way that made me extremely jealous.
I wasn't sure you were the same. Let's see, the last time we met --
I'm afraid Major Strasser would insist.
You're saying this only to make me go.
How do you do?
How do you do?
How do you do?
One hears a great deal about Rick in Casablanca.

And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.

Won't you join us for a drink?
And I congratulate you.
What for?
What for?
Your work.
Your work.
Thank you. I try.
Thank you. I try.
We all try. You succeed.
I hope we didn't overstay our welcome.
Not at all.
We'll come again.
Any time.
Good morning.
Signor Ferrari is the fat gent at the table.
Good evening.
Good evening. You see, here we are again.
Good evening. You see, here we are again.
I take that as a great compliment to Sam. I suppose he means to you Paris of, well, happier days.
Monsieur Blaine, I wonder if I could talk to you?
Go ahead.
Go ahead.
Well, isn't there some other place? It's rather confidential, what I have to say.
Well, isn't there some other place? It's rather confidential, what I have to say.
My office.
My office.
Right.
You must know it's very important I get out of Casablanca. It's my privilege to be one of the leaders of a great movement. You know what I have been doing. You know what it means to the work, to the lives of thousands and thousands of people that I be free to reach America and continue my work.
I'm not interested in politics. The problems of the world are not in my department. I'm a saloon keeper.

My friends in the underground tell me that you have quite a record. You ran guns to Ethiopia. You fought against the fascists in Spain.

What of it?
What of it?
Isn't it strange that you always happened to be fighting on the side of the underdog?
Isn't it strange that you always happened to be fighting on the side of the underdog?
Yes. I found that a very expensive hobby, too. But then I never was much of a businessman.
Are you enough of a businessman to appreciate an offer of a hundred thousand francs?
I appreciate it, but I don't accept it.
I appreciate it, but I don't accept it.
I'll raise it to two hundred thousand.
I'll raise it to two hundred thousand.
My friend, you could make it a million francs, or three, my answer would still be the same.

There must be some reason why you won't let me have them.

There is. I suggest that you ask your wife.
There is. I suggest that you ask your wife.
I beg your pardon?

I said, ask your wife.
I said, ask your wife.
My wife?
Well, this might come in handy.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Had a close one, eh?
Had a close one, eh?
Yes, rather.
Don't you sometimes wonder if it's worth all this? I mean what you're fighting for?
We might as well question why we breathe. If we stop breathing, we'll die. If we stop fighting our enemies, the world will die.
We might as well question why we breathe. If we stop breathing, we'll die. If we stop fighting our enemies, the world will die.
What of it? Then it'll be out of it's misery.
You know how you sound, Monsieur Blaine? Like a man who's trying to convince himself of something he doesn't believe in his heart. Each of us has a destiny, for good or for evil.
Yes, I get the point.
I wonder if you do. I wonder if you know that you're trying to escape from yourself and that you'll never succeed.
You seem to know all about my destiny.
You seem to know all about my destiny.
I know a good deal more about you than you suspect. I know, for instance, that you are in love with a woman. It is perhaps strange that we both should be in love with the same woman. The first evening I came here in this cafe, I knew there was something between you and Ilsa. Since no one is to blame, I, I

The first evening I came here in this cafe, I knew there was something between you and Ilsa. Since no one is to blame, I, I
You love her that much?
You love her that much?
Apparently you think of me only as the leader of a cause. Well, I am also a human being.
Monsieur Blaine, I don't know how to thank you.
Oh, save it. We've still lots of things to do.
I brought the money, Monsieur Blaine.
Keep it. You'll need it in America.
Keep it. You'll need it in America.
But we made a deal.
But we made a deal.
Oh, never mind about that. You won't have any trouble in Lisbon, will you?
Oh, never mind about that. You won't have any trouble in Lisbon, will you?
No. It's all arranged.
No. It's all arranged.
Good. I've got the letters right here, all made out in blank.
Everything in order?
All except one thing. There's something you should know before you leave.
All except one thing. There's something you should know before you leave.
Monsieur Blaine, I don't ask you to explain anything.
Monsieur Blaine, I don't ask you to explain anything.
I'm going to anyway, because it may make a difference to you later on. You said you knew about Ilsa and me.
I'm going to anyway, because it may make a difference to you later on. You said you knew about Ilsa and me.
Yes.
Yes.
But you didn't know she was at my place last night when you were. She came there for the letters of transit. Isn't that true, Ilsa?
I understand.
Here it is.
Monsieur Laszlo, is it not?
Yes.
Yes.
I am Captain Renault, Prefect of Police.
I am Captain Renault, Prefect of Police.
Yes. What is it you want?
Yes. What is it you want?
Merely to welcome you to Casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay. It is not often we have so distinguished a visitor.
Merely to welcome you to Casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay. It is not often we have so distinguished a visitor.
Thank you. I hope you'll forgive me, Captain, but the present French administration has not always been so cordial. May I present Miss Ilsa Lund?
Thank you. I hope you'll forgive me, Captain, but the present French administration has not always been so cordial. May I present Miss Ilsa Lund?
I was informed you were the most beautiful woman ever to visit Casablanca. That was a gross understatement.
No, Captain, please.
No. Please, Monsieur, it is a little game we play. They put it on the bill, I tear the bill up. It is very convenient.
Let us say that it is my request. That is a much more pleasant word.
Very well.
My bill.
No. Two champagne cocktails, please.
Well! A precedent is being broken. Er, Emil!
This is a very interesting cafe. I congratulate you.
Ricky, you're becoming quite human. I suppose we have to thank you for that, Mademoiselle.
Ilsa, I don't wish to be the one to say it, but it's late.
Ilsa, I don't wish to be the one to say it, but it's late.
So it is. And we have a curfew here in Casablanca. It would never do for the Chief of Police to be found drinking after hours and have to fine himself.
Tomorrow at ten at the Prefect's office.
We'll be there.
We'll be there.
Goodnight.
I am delighted to see you both. Did you have a good night's rest?
I slept very well.
I slept very well.
That's strange. Nobody is supposed to sleep well in Casablanca.
That's strange. Nobody is supposed to sleep well in Casablanca.
May we proceed with the business?
May we proceed with the business?
With pleasure. Won't you sit down?
With pleasure. Won't you sit down?
Thank you.
I am afraid not. My regrets, Monsieur.
Well, perhaps I shall like it in Casablanca.
And the honor of having served the Third Reich.
I was in a German concentration camp for a year. That's honor enough for a lifetime.
Monsieur, insofar as it is in my power --
-- Thank you.
-- Thank you.
By the way, Monsieur, last night you evinced an interest in Signor Ugarte.
By the way, Monsieur, last night you evinced an interest in Signor Ugarte.
Yes.
Yes.
I believe you have a message for him?
I believe you have a message for him?
Nothing important, but may I speak to him now?
I am making out the report now. We haven't quite decided whether he committed suicide or died trying to escape.
Are you quite finished with us?
I'm sure you'll excuse me if I am not gracious, but you see, Major Strasser, I'm a Czechoslovakian.
You were a Czechoslovakian. Now you are a subject of the German Reich!
I've never accepted that privilege, and I'm now on French soil.
I should like to discuss some matters arising from your presence on French soil.

This is hardly the time or the place.
This is hardly the time or the place.
Then we shall state another time and another place. Tomorrow at ten in the Prefect's office, with Mademoiselle.
Then we shall state another time and another place. Tomorrow at ten in the Prefect's office, with Mademoiselle.
Captain Renault, I am under your authority. Is it your order that we come to your office?
Very well, Herr Laszlo, we will not mince words. You are an escaped prisoner of the Reich. So far you have been fortunate enough in eluding us. You have reached Casablanca. It is my duty to see that you stay in Casablanca.
Whether or not you succeed is, of course, problematical.
Whether or not you succeed is, of course, problematical.
Not at all. Captain Renault's signature is necessary on every exit visa. Captain, would you think it is possible that Herr Laszlo will receive a visa?
Is that all you wish to tell us?
Don't be in such a hurry. You have all the time in the world. You may be in Casablanca indefinitely... or you may leave for Lisbon tomorrow, on one condition.
Don't be in such a hurry. You have all the time in the world. You may be in Casablanca indefinitely... or you may leave for Lisbon tomorrow, on one condition.
And that is?
And that is?
You know the leaders of the underground movement in Paris, in Prague, in Brussels, in Amsterdam, in Oslo, in Belgrade, in Athens.
You know the leaders of the underground movement in Paris, in Prague, in Brussels, in Amsterdam, in Oslo, in Belgrade, in Athens.
Even in Berlin.
Even in Berlin.
Yes, even in Berlin. If you will furnish me with their names and their exact whereabouts, you will have your visa in the morning.
You will give us the names?
If I didn't give them to you in a concentration camp where you had more "persuasive methods" at your disposal, I certainly won't give them to you now.
And what if you track down these men and kill them? What if you murdered all of us? From every corner of Europe, hundreds, thousands, would rise to take our places. Even Nazis can't kill that fast.
Herr Laszlo, you have a reputation for eloquence which I can now understand. But in one respect you are mistaken. You said the enemies of the Reich could all be replaced, but there is one exception. No one could take your place in the event anything unfortunate should occur to you while you were trying to escape.

No one could take your place in the event anything unfortunate should occur to you while you were trying to escape.
You won't dare to interfere with me here. This is still unoccupied France. Any violation of neutrality would reflect on Captain Renault.
For the time being.
Good day.
Unoccupied France welcomes you to Casablanca.
Thank you, Captain. It's very good to be here.
Thank you, Captain. It's very good to be here.
Major Strasser, my aide, Lieutenant Casselle.
You may find the climate of Casablanca a trifle warm, Major.
Oh, we Germans must get used to all climates, from Russia to the Sahara. But perhaps you were not referring to the weather.

What else, my dear Major?
What else, my dear Major?
By the way, the murder of the couriers, what has been done?
By the way, the murder of the couriers, what has been done?
Realizing the importance of the case, my men are rounding up twice the usual number of suspects.
Oh, there is no hurry. Tonight he'll be at Rick's. Everybody comes to Rick's.
I have already heard about this cafe, and also about Mr. Rick himself.
Good evening, gentlemen.
Good evening, Captain.
Thank you. It is a pleasure to have you here, Major.
Champagne and a tin of caviar.
Champagne and a tin of caviar.
May I recommend Veuve Cliquot '26, a good French wine.
May I recommend Veuve Cliquot '26, a good French wine.
Thank you.
Especially so tonight, Major. In a few minutes you will see the arrest of the man who murdered your couriers.
I expected no less, Captain.
Rick, this is Major Heinrich Strasser of the Third Reich.
How do you do, Mr. Rick?
You repeat "Third Reich" as though you expected there to be others.
Well, personally, Major, I will take what comes.
Well, personally, Major, I will take what comes.
Do you mind if I ask you a few questions? Unofficially, of course.
Ho, diplomatist!
How about New York?
Rick is completely neutral about everything. And that takes in the field of women, too.
You weren't always so carefully neutral. We have a complete dossier on you.
Of course, one must admit he has great courage.
I admit he is very clever. Three times he slipped through our fingers. In Paris he continued his activities. We intend not to let it happen again.
You see, Major, you have nothing to worry about Rick.
Perhaps.
Mademoiselle.
Mademoiselle.
I strongly suspect that Ugarte left the letters of transit with Mr. Blaine. I would suggest you search the cafe immediately and thoroughly.
If Rick has the letters, he's much too smart to let you find them there.
If Rick has the letters, he's much too smart to let you find them there.
You give him credit for too much cleverness. My impression was that he's just another blundering American.
You give him credit for too much cleverness. My impression was that he's just another blundering American.
But we mustn't underestimate American blundering. I was with them when they "blundered" into Berlin in 1918.
As to Laszlo, we want him watched twenty-four hours a day.
It may interest you to know that at this very moment he is on his way here.
You see, Captain, the situation is not as much under control as you believe.
My dear Major, we are trying to cooperate with your government, but we cannot regulate the feelings of our people.
Captain Renault, are you entirely certain which side you're on?
I have no conviction, if that's what you mean. I blow with the wind, and the prevailing wind happens to be from Vichy.
I have no conviction, if that's what you mean. I blow with the wind, and the prevailing wind happens to be from Vichy.
And if it should change?
We are concerned about more than Casablanca. We know that every French province in Africa is honeycombed with traitors waiting for their chance, waiting, perhaps, for a leader.
A leader, like Laszlo?
A leader, like Laszlo?
Uh, huh. I have been thinking. It is too dangerous if we let him go. It may be too dangerous if we let him stay.
Uh, huh. I have been thinking. It is too dangerous if we let him go. It may be too dangerous if we let him stay.
I see what you mean.
You see what I mean? If Laszlo's presence in a cafe can inspire this unfortunate demonstration, what more will his presence in Casablanca bring on? I advise that this place be shut up at once.
But everybody's having such a good time.
But everybody's having such a good time.
Yes, much too good a time. The place is to be closed.
Yes, much too good a time. The place is to be closed.
But I have no excuse to close it.
But I have no excuse to close it.
Find one.
What is the meaning of that phone call?
Victor Laszlo is on that plane.
Why do you stand here? Why don't you stop him?
Ask Monsieur Rick.
Hello, Louis.
How extravagant you are, throwing away women like that. Someday they may be scarce.
You know, I think now I shall pay a call on Yvonne, maybe get her on the rebound, eh?
When it comes to women, you're a true democrat.
The plane to Lisbon. You would like to be on it?
Why? What's in Lisbon?
Why? What's in Lisbon?
The clipper to America.
It was a combination of all three.
And what in heaven's name brought you to Casablanca?
And what in heaven's name brought you to Casablanca?
My health. I came to Casablanca for the waters.

Waters? What waters? We're in the desert.
Waters? What waters? We're in the desert.
I was misinformed.
I was misinformed.
Huh!
Rick, there's going to be some excitement here tonight. We are going to make an arrest in your cafe.
What, again?
What, again?
This is no ordinary arrest. A murderer, no less.
If you are thinking of warning him, don't put yourself out. He cannot possibly escape.
I stick my neck out for nobody.
I stick my neck out for nobody.
A wise foreign policy.
You know, Rick, we could have made this arrest earlier in the evening at the Blue Parrot, but out of my high regard for you we are staging it here. It will amuse your customers.
Our entertainment is enough.
I see. And what's Strasser doing here? He certainly didn't come all the way to Casablanca to witness a demonstration of your efficiency.
Perhaps not.
How observant you are. As a matter of fact, I wanted to give you a word of advice.
Yeah? Have a brandy?
Yeah? Have a brandy?
Thank you. Rick, there are many exit visas sold in this cafe, but we know that you have never sold one. That is the reason we permit you to remain open.
Thank you. Rick, there are many exit visas sold in this cafe, but we know that you have never sold one. That is the reason we permit you to remain open.
I thought it was because we let you win at roulette.
I thought it was because we let you win at roulette.
That is another reason. There is a man who's arrived in Casablanca on his way to America. He will offer a fortune to anyone who will furnish him with an exit visa.
That is another reason. There is a man who's arrived in Casablanca on his way to America. He will offer a fortune to anyone who will furnish him with an exit visa.
Yeah? What's his name?
Yeah? What's his name?
Victor Laszlo.
Victor Laszlo.
Victor Laszlo?
Rick, that is the first time I have ever seen you so impressed.
Well, he's succeeded in impressing half the world.
Well, he's succeeded in impressing half the world.
It is my duty to see that he doesn't impress the other half. Rick, Laszlo must never reach America. He stays in Casablanca.
It is my duty to see that he doesn't impress the other half. Rick, Laszlo must never reach America. He stays in Casablanca.
It'll be interesting to see how he manages.

Manages what?

His escape.
His escape.
Oh, but I just told you. --
Oh, but I just told you. --
-- Stop it. He escaped from a concentration camp and the Nazis have been chasing him all over Europe.
-- Stop it. He escaped from a concentration camp and the Nazis have been chasing him all over Europe.
This is the end of the chase.

Twenty thousand francs says it isn't.
Is that a serious offer?
I just paid out twenty. I'd like to get it back.
I just paid out twenty. I'd like to get it back.
Make it ten. I am only a poor corrupt official.
Make it ten. I am only a poor corrupt official.
Okay.
Okay.
Done. No matter how clever he is, he still needs an exit visa, or I should say, two.
Done. No matter how clever he is, he still needs an exit visa, or I should say, two.
Why two?
Why two?
He is traveling with a lady.

He'll take one.

I think not. I have seen the lady. And if he did not leave her in Marseilles, or in Oran, he certainly won't leave her in Casablanca.

Maybe he's not quite as romantic as you are.

It doesn't matter. There is no exit visa for him.

Louis, whatever gave you the impression that I might be interested in helping Laszlo escape?
Louis, whatever gave you the impression that I might be interested in helping Laszlo escape?
Because, my dear Ricky, I suspect that under that cynical shell you're at heart a sentimentalist.
Oh, laugh if you will, but I happen to be familiar with your record. Let me point out just two items. In 1935 you ran guns to Ethiopia. In 1936, you fought in Spain on the Loyalist side.
And got well paid for it on both occasions.
And got well paid for it on both occasions.
The winning side would have paid you much better.

Maybe. Well, it seems you are determined to keep Laszlo here.
Maybe. Well, it seems you are determined to keep Laszlo here.
I have my orders.
I have my orders.
Oh, I see. Gestapo spank.
Yeah, you were saying?
Excuse me.
Oh, how do you do?
And you already know Herr Heinze of the Third Reich.
That makes Rick a citizen of the world.
I was born in New York City if that'll help you any.
Well, you were asking about Rick and here he is. Mademoiselle, may I present --
-- Hello, Ilsa.
Oh, no, Rick never --
-- Thanks. I will.
Oh, it's my party.
Another precedent gone. This has been a very interesting evening. I'll call you a cab. Gasoline rationing, time of night.
Well, Ricky. I'm very pleased with you. Now you're beginning to live like a Frenchman.
That was some going-over your men gave my place this afternoon. We just barely got cleaned up in time to open.
Well, I told Strasser he wouldn't find the letters here. But I told my men to be especially destructive. You know how that impresses Germans? Rick, have you got these letters of transit?
Louis, are you pro-Vichy or Free French?
Louis, are you pro-Vichy or Free French?
Serves me right for asking a direct question. The subject is closed.
Serves me right for asking a direct question. The subject is closed.
Well, it looks like you're a little late.
Well, it looks like you're a little late.
Huh?
So Yvonne's gone over to the enemy.
Who knows? In her own way she may constitute an entire second front. I think it's time for me to flatter Major Strasser a little. I'll see you later, Rick.
As I suspected, you're a rank sentimentalist.
Yeah? Why?
Yeah? Why?
Why do you interfere with my little romances?
Why do you interfere with my little romances?
Put it down as a gesture to love.
Put it down as a gesture to love.
Well, I forgive you this time. But I'll be in tomorrow night with a breathtaking blonde, and it will make me very happy if she loses. Uh huh!
How can you close me up? On what grounds?
I am shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here!
But you haven't any actual proof, and you know it. This isn't Germany or occupied France. All you can do is fine him a few thousand francs and give him thirty days. You might as well let him go now.
Ricky, I'd advise you not to be too interested in what happens to Laszlo. If by any chance you were to help him escape --

-- What makes you think I'd stick my neck out for Laszlo?
-- What makes you think I'd stick my neck out for Laszlo?
Because one, you've bet ten thousand francs he'd escape. Two, you have the letters of transit, now don't bother to deny it. And, well, you might do it simply because you don't like Strasser's looks. As a matter of fact, I don't like him either.

Well, they're all excellent reasons.
Well, they're all excellent reasons.
Don't count too much on my friendship, Ricky. In this matter I'm powerless. Besides, I might lose ten thousand francs.

You're not very subtle, but you are effective. I, I get the point. Yes, I have the letters, but I intend using them myself. I'm leaving Casablanca on tonight's plane, the last plane.

Huh?
Huh?
And I'm taking a friend with me. One you'll appreciate.
And I'm taking a friend with me. One you'll appreciate.
What friend?
What friend?
Ilsa Lund. That ought to put your mind to rest about my helping Laszlo escape. The last man I want to see in America.
Ilsa Lund. That ought to put your mind to rest about my helping Laszlo escape. The last man I want to see in America.
You didn't come here to tell me this. You have the letters of transit. You can fill in your name and hers and leave any time you please. Why are you interested in what happens to Laszlo?
Ilsa is Laszlo's wife. She probably knows things that Strasser would like to know. Louis, I'll make a deal with you. Instead of this petty charge you have against him, you can get something really big, something that would chuck him in a concentration camp for years. That would be quite a feather in your cap, wouldn't it?
It certainly would. Germany... Vichy would be very grateful.
It certainly would. Germany... Vichy would be very grateful.
Then release him. You be at my place a half hour before the plane leaves.
I'll arrange to have Laszlo come there to pick up the letters of transit, and that'll give you the criminal grounds on which to make the arrest. You get him, and we get away. To the Germans that last will be just a minor annoyance.
There's still something about this business I don't quite understand. Miss Lund, she's very beautiful, yes, but you were never interested in any woman.
There's still something about this business I don't quite understand. Miss Lund, she's very beautiful, yes, but you were never interested in any woman.
Well, she isn't just any woman.
I see. How do I know you'll keep your end of the bargain?
I'll make the arrangements right now with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.

Ricky, I'm going to miss you. Apparently you're the only one in Casablanca who has even less scruples than I.
Ricky, I'm going to miss you. Apparently you're the only one in Casablanca who has even less scruples than I.
Oh, thanks.
Oh, thanks.
Go ahead, Ricky.
You're late.
I was informed just as Laszlo was about to leave the hotel, so I knew I'd be on time.
I was informed just as Laszlo was about to leave the hotel, so I knew I'd be on time.
I thought I asked you to tie up your watchdogs.
I thought I asked you to tie up your watchdogs.
Oh, he won't be followed here.
You know, this place will never be the same without you, Ricky.
Yes, I know what you mean, but I've already spoken to Ferrari. You'll still win at roulette.
Yes, I know what you mean, but I've already spoken to Ferrari. You'll still win at roulette.
Is everything ready?
I have the letters right here.
Tell me, when we searched the place, where were they?
Tell me, when we searched the place, where were they?
Sam's piano.
Sam's piano.
Serves me right for not being musical.
-- Not so fast, Louis. Nobody's going to be arrested. Not for a while yet.
Have you taken leave of your senses?
Have you taken leave of your senses?
I have. Sit down over there.
I have. Sit down over there.
Put that gun down.
I suppose you know what you're doing, but I wonder if you realize what this means?
I do. We've got plenty of time to discuss that later.
I do. We've got plenty of time to discuss that later.
Call off your watch-dogs you said.

Just the same, you call the airport and let me hear you tell them. And remember, this gun's pointed right at your heart.
Just the same, you call the airport and let me hear you tell them. And remember, this gun's pointed right at your heart.
That is my least vulnerable spot.
If you don't mind, you fill in the names. That will make it even more official.
You think of everything, don't you?
You think of everything, don't you?
And the names are Mr. and Mrs. Victor Laszlo.
Well I was right. You are a sentimentalist.
Stay where you are. I don't know what you're talking about.
What you just did for Laszlo, and that fairy tale that you invented to send Ilsa away with him. I know a little about women, my friend. She went, but she knew you were lying.
Anyway, thanks for helping me out.
Anyway, thanks for helping me out.
I suppose you know this isn't going to be pleasant for either of us, especially for you. I'll have to arrest you of course.
I suppose you know this isn't going to be pleasant for either of us, especially for you. I'll have to arrest you of course.
As soon as the plane goes, Louis.
Well, Rick, you're not only a sentimentalist, but you've become a patriot.
Maybe, but it seemed like a good time to start.
Maybe, but it seemed like a good time to start.
I think perhaps you're right.
It might be a good idea for you to disappear from Casablanca for a while. There's a Free French garrison over at Brazzaville. I could be induced to arrange a passage.
My letter of transit? I could use a trip. But it doesn't make any difference about our bet. You still owe me ten thousand francs.

And that ten thousand francs should pay our expenses.

Uh huh.

Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
Where were you last night?
That's so long ago, I don't remember.
That's so long ago, I don't remember.
Will I see you tonight?
Will I see you tonight?
I never make plans that far ahead.
Give me another.
Sacha, she's had enough.
Sacha, she's had enough.
Don't listen to him, Sacha. Fill it up.
Rick, I'm sick and tired of having you --
-- Sacha, call a cab.
Come on, we're going to get your coat.
Take your hands off me!
Make it official, if you like.
What is your nationality?
What is your nationality?
I'm a drunkard.
I understand you came here from Paris at the time of the occupation.
There seems to be no secret about that.

Are you one of those people who cannot imagine the Germans in their beloved Paris?
Are you one of those people who cannot imagine the Germans in their beloved Paris?
It's not particularly my beloved Paris.
Well, there are certain sections of New York, Major, that I wouldn't advise you to try to invade.
Aha. Who do you think will win the war?
Aha. Who do you think will win the war?
I haven't the slightest idea.
Are my eyes really brown?
You will forgive my curiosity, Mr. Blaine. The point is, an enemy of the Reich has come to Casablanca and we are checking up on anybody who can be of any help to us.

My interest in whether Victor Laszlo stays or goes is purely a sporting one.

In this case, you have no sympathy for the fox, huh?

Not particularly. I understand the point of view of the hound, too.
Victor Laszlo published the foulest lies in the Prague newspapers until the very day we marched in, and even after that he continued to print scandal sheets in a cellar.
You'll excuse me, gentlemen. Your business is politics. Mine is running a saloon.
Good evening, Mr. Blaine.
I would advise you not to interfere.
I was willing to shoot Captain Renault, and I'm willing to shoot you.
Hello?
Put that phone down!
Put that phone down!
Get me the Radio Tower!
Get me the Radio Tower!
Put it down!
Uh, excuse me, please. Hello, Rick.
Hello Ugarte.
Huh. You know, Rick, watching you just now with the Deutsches Bank, one would think you'd been doing this all your life.
Well, what makes you think I haven't?
Well, what makes you think I haven't?
Oh, nothing. But when you first came to Casablanca, I thought --
Oh, nothing. But when you first came to Casablanca, I thought --
-- You thought what?
May I? Too bad about those two German couriers, wasn't it?
They got a lucky break. Yesterday they were just two German clerks. Today they're the 'Honored Dead'.
They got a lucky break. Yesterday they were just two German clerks. Today they're the 'Honored Dead'.
You are a very cynical person, Rick, if you'll forgive me for saying so.
Thank you. Will you have a drink with me please?
No.
No.
I forgot. You never drink with... I'll have another, please. You despise me, don't you?
I forgot. You never drink with... I'll have another, please. You despise me, don't you?
If I gave you any thought, I probably would.
If I gave you any thought, I probably would.
But why? Oh, you object to the kind of business I do, huh? But think of all those poor refugees who must rot in this place if I didn't help them. That's not so bad. Through ways of my own I provide them with exit visas.

For a price, Ugarte, for a price.
For a price, Ugarte, for a price.
But think of all the poor devils who cannot meet Renault's price. I get it for them for half. Is that so parasitic?

Well, Rick, after tonight I'll be through with the whole business, and I am leaving finally this Casablanca.
Well, Rick, after tonight I'll be through with the whole business, and I am leaving finally this Casablanca.
Who did you bribe for your visa? Renault or yourself?
Who did you bribe for your visa? Renault or yourself?
Myself. I found myself much more reasonable.
One moment. Tonight I'll be selling those for more money than even I have ever dreamed of, and then, addio Casablanca! You know, Rick, I have many friends in Casablanca, but somehow, just because you despise me you're the only one I trust. Will you keep these for me? Please.
For how long?
For how long?
Perhaps an hour, perhaps a little longer.
Perhaps an hour, perhaps a little longer.
I don't want them here overnight.
I don't want them here overnight.
Don't be afraid of that. Please keep them for me. Thank you. I knew I could trust you.
Rick! Rick, help me!
Don't be a fool. You can't get away.
Don't be a fool. You can't get away.
Rick, hide me. Do something! You must help me, Rick. Do something!
Sam, Ferrari wants you to work for him at the Blue Parrot.

They grab Ugarte and she walks in. Well, that's the way it goes. One in, one out. Sam?
Yeah, boss?
Yeah, boss?
Sam, if it's December 1941 in Casablanca, what time is it in New York?
Sam, if it's December 1941 in Casablanca, what time is it in New York?
Uh, my watch stopped.

I bet they're asleep in New York. I'll bet they're asleep all over America.
What's that you're playing?
Just a little something of my own.

If she can stand it, I can. Play it!
If she can stand it, I can. Play it!
Yes, boss.
This sort of takes the sting out of being occupied, doesn't it, Mr. Richard?
You said it! Here's looking at you, kid.
And getting closer every minute. Here. Drink up. We'll never finish the other three.
The Germans'll be here pretty soon now, and they'll come looking for you. And don't forget there's a price on your head.
Where is she? Have you seen her?
No, Mr. Richard. I can't find her.
It took this test package thirty-two hours to get from Seattle to St. Petersburg, a distance of nine thousand miles. And then it took forty-one hours to get from our warehouse in St. Petersburg to here, a distance of, what --
Six kilometers. Four miles.
Six kilometers. Four miles.
So how are we going to get this place shaped up?
It's bad.
Worse than Warsaw.

Nobody remembers that.

If they can't see you, what's the point?
Survive today, that's the point.

You don't know where you are. You missed the shipping lanes.

They'd eat you if they could. They're laughing at you. Listen.
I'm lost. Goodbye.
No!
Look, just slip off the raft. The ocean would feel so good, the water's so soft and warm. Take a little swim. Sleep.
You quitter you quitter you quitter.

Grow up, stop being such a baby. Other people get through a lot worse.
Yeah, sure, what?
You know, Wilson, every now and then we should say thank you. Thank you God.
Thank you for fucking up my life.
What are you smiling about? They'll be back.
I'm dancing on the roof of the Peabody Hotel. With Kelly.
They're never going to see you. You're just another piece of trash in the ocean.
They're on autopilot.

Let's get a second opinion. Wilson? What do you see?
What did it matter if FedEx was five minutes late one day? The next day we just start over again.
It matters. We do the best we can, that's all we have.
It matters. We do the best we can, that's all we have.
Then we've just got shit.
You can't make it.
Shut up. I don't feel like dying today.
You came on a bicycle? No wonder it's so late.
There was an unavoidable delay.
Well, I have to say, I'm impressed. You never gave up.
No.
You know what happened to this?
As much as anybody.

Want to come in? Get dry for a minute.

Do you...have any more packages to deliver?

No. that was the last one.

Just sit here, I'll get us some lunch.
Keep painting. Promise me.
Sure.
Did you really steal a crippled kid's bicycle to make your deliveries, or is that just some bullshit story?

I didn't want to. It just happened. One day Gary was there. He took care of everything. He took care of me. I was a mess.
You have any children?
Her name's Hannah.
Is that Jango?
Is that Jango?
No, this is Jack. Jango was hit by a UPS truck. Can you believe it?
What's that?
That's my sea anchor. My second one. Made it out of part of the sail. It keeps you from capsizing in a storm. In theory. And this, this I used to collect water. About half a cup a day.
All that time I waited to go on a cruise, and you went without me.
Yeah, well...couldn't be helped.
What's that, written on the sail?
My epitaph.
There was a coffin?
Yeah, coffin, headstone, the whole thing.
Yeah, coffin, headstone, the whole thing.
What was inside?

Don't overwhelm me with the details. You know how I hate that.
Come on. Try.
Cliches, mainly. Don't take anyone for granted. Don't sweat the small stuff. Live each day like it's your last.

So simple to say, so hard to do.
So simple to say, so hard to do.
Not when you have no choice.
You hated being alone. Couldn't stand it. Busy every minute. Always plugged into something.
I didn't know what really being alone was. No one back here does.
This is so unfair.
That's what I told the fish I caught. But I ate them anyway.
You okay?
Great. Really.
What will you do?
I don't know. I really don't know.
I've got to get back to Memphis. Hannah's babysitter has finals.
It means a lot...that you came.
It means a lot...that you came.
I had to come. To be sure you were okay.
I love you, Chuck.
You too.
You too.
I'm so glad you're alive.
I need the latest PDRs on St. Petersburg.
And how was your Christmas?
And how was your Christmas?
Terrific. Yours?
When's the next Jumbo?
The regular flight is scheduled for oh three hundred tomorrow.

Anything else?

There's a sweep leaving Memphis in an hour, goes through Sydney.
My favorite doctor. What's the verdict?
Under the circumstances your overall health is good. Those salt water boils you picked up on the raft are ulcerated, but they're healing nicely.
Sorry...sorry... Why do my joints still ache?
Dehydration. Vitamin deficiency. Protein deficiency. Any or all of the above.

And fish are very low in fat, which is energy inefficient. So you're going to burn up your own cells no matter how much you eat. Luckily you ate the eyes and pancreas, which contain some Vitamin C, so you didn't get scurvy.
I am one lucky guy.
Your body chemistry and your exposure to the elements would normally lead to irritability, depression, anxiety, periods of self-reproach. It's almost like schizophrenia. Different sides of your personality might come to life, speak out, act out.

But all that's behind me. I'm fine now.
If you say you are.
I most definitely say I am.

Doctor Hegel tells me he discussed the Vietnam POW syndrome with you.
Yes, yes he did.
You are aware of the potential disruptiveness on your loved ones when you return to your old life?

Not to mention on me.
Doc, I'm not on the island. I'm not on the raft. I'm alive. I'm so glad to be back, I can't tell you. I just want out of here.
Well, when that IV runs out, you're through with us. Just the dentist tomorrow.
Need some help?
You bet I do. High tide comes right up to this road.
You're not out of Pascagoula, are you?
No.
I used to drive one of those. A long time ago.
Hey, once a driver, always a driver. You want a lift? I've just got one more pickup.

Sure.
You're Chuck Noland.
Yeah.
Bless us O Lord, and these thy gifts, which we are about to receive, from thou bounty, through Christ the Lord. Amen.
Let's eat.
Thought you were going to bring her.
So did I.
But chickens?
Sixty three pounds consumed per capita, up from twenty seven in 1960. Going to pass beef. Chicken's global. No religious taboos. You don't see your Hindus and your Muslims boycotting poultry.

True enough. No sacred chickens nowhere, so far as I know.
Really?
Come on down to the plant. It's state of the art. We're doing for chickens what FedEx did for the delivery business.

Just don't count 'em before they hatch.
What happened to your pants?
Mom, meet Jango.
It seemed like she had such a good time last time.
It's nothing you did, Mom, believe me.
Look, I help take care of the place. You got my check, didn't you Mom?
That new roof, that's your doing.
Mom, this is a farm. We've got real strawberries growing outside, we've got real cream.
Oh no, the prodigal son's home. We bring out the store bought.
Maybe I should take a few days off. Roger's working now, you could use some help around here...
Don't you even think about it.
Don't you even think about it.
The place is falling apart.
The place is falling apart.
I'm doing fine.
Doing great, Mom, don't worry about me.
There's settled folks, and there's nomads. You're just not a settled folk. You never belonged here.
When'd you start working here?
Roger got me on. I wasn't doing anything, and -- but you're back, you're really back. I would have come to Memphis, but --

I wanted to come here.
I've got all this back pay coming. Why don't you let me get you a place in town?
This is my home. I'm part of the wallpaper.
What a journey you've had. It seems more than a person should have to bear.
The tide saved me, Mom. I lived by it. I'm just wondering where it will take me next.
Trying.
Kamal, you're breaking up. Can you hear us?
Okay. After three years the PTR reverts to tape storage, which is okay because we access it through the CPC. Here it is. Ten packages from the same sender. Baku. Delhi. St. Petersburg. The guy was a real road warrior. This package was Kuala Lampur. No activity in his account after this package. No forwarding addresses after K.L.
What about the sender?
What about the sender?
Sure. Bettina Peterson. Marfa, Texas. Let's run a current check.
Hmmm. Durango, Colorado; Asheville, North Carolina, then...canceled her account.
Can you find her?
Can you find her?
You're looking at a Level III search. For your Level III, you gotta have E-4 authorization. I don't have it.
Kamal is not here.

Who's in charge then, where is Chinn?
What do you expect, from the guy who stole a kid's bicycle when his truck broke down?
Borrowed. I borrowed it.
How'd it go?
Great. Terrific. The good guys won one for a change.
You what?
It was fifteen minutes late.
I checked the weather, you had the jet stream, you could have made it up.
But I might not have.

You know General McLelland, he wouldn't attack unless he had everything just right. Finally Abe Lincoln came to him and said, General, if you're not going to use my army, could I borrow it for a while? So he gave it to Grant and Grant just said, let's go.

We're warriors, not desk jockeys. We've got to be bold. You always want all your ducks lined up. But nothing's 100 percent. It's always 60-40, maybe 51-49. Hell, I'd take 40-60. Then roll the dice.

Hello?
Stan, it's Chuck...Chuck Noland...
God damn! God damn! Chuck, it's you!
It's me.
It's me.
You're fucking dead!
You're fucking dead!
I'm most definitely not dead. And as I recall, you're the sick fucker.
I beat the odds!
You beat 'em to shit, pal! Jesus!
Hello.
This is Amber. Her boyfriend lost his foot in a shark attack.
How about we go somewhere else?
Want to see my raft?
This stinks really bad.
You should have smelled me.
Cool ropes.
I braided them.
I braided them.
Must have taken a hell of a long time.
Must have taken a hell of a long time.
Time I had lots of.
You were how long on this?
Forty-three days.
When I first showed up, I thought you'd lost your fucking marbles.
I never thought it would end. Then it did. It was so great to be saved, I couldn't stop laughing.
To Wilson.
To Wilson.
You've been over the line and you came back. You've been saved, hallelujah!
Hallelujah.
I'm serious. The burning bush, the big picture, the words in neon...
What's it all about? It's about being so thirsty you'd crush a fish's backbone to suck out the spinal fluid -- that's what it's about.
To life. Fuck 'em if they can't take a joke.
To life.
To life.
That's all there is.
That's all there is.
Believe me I know.
Digital laser readers.
Digital laser readers. Wow. Terrific.
Take your time.
What?
What?
That's what it's about.
That's what it's about.
Being patient. Don't rush things. I get it.
Not just that. Take your time. Use it. Live it.
Deep, real deep.
What, then?
Deliver this package. Then, I dunno.
Deliver this package. Then, I dunno.
You want that delivered, we'll deliver it. That's what we do.
You want that delivered, we'll deliver it. That's what we do.
I need to do it.

Finish what you started. You haven't changed, Chuck. It's still you.
Thanks. For everything.
No sweat.
Permission to come aboard, sir.
Permission granted.
Permission granted.
May I ask, where are you bound?
May I ask, where are you bound?
San Francisco. And you?

As it happens, I'm headed for Frisco myself.

No please, join me. Some sundried fish strips, a few eyeballs, some gills to munch on.
Only if you can afford it.
Try to think of nothing, Dorothy.
It's not ergot, it's not pituitary extract, it's not oil of rue...

Wilbur, the adopting couple is waiting in your office.
Life is waiting.
I was dreaming about you. How beautiful you were!
You weren't dreaming about me.
You weren't dreaming about me.
I was!
Then I wasn't beautiful.
You were! You *are*! It was fantastic.
You were! You *are*! It was fantastic.
It was just the ether, Wilbur...
They want to replace me! The Board of Trustees wants to *replace* me!
They just want you to hire some new help.
They just want you to hire some new help.
Some new *things* would be useful. I don't need any "new help."
He'll need clothes... some money...
Let him try to *make* some money! That's part of "seeing the world," isn't it?

Oh, just stop it! You knew this was going to happen. He's a young man.

He's still a boy--out in the world, he's still a boy.
He's still a boy--out in the world, he's still a boy.
Just find him some clothes, Wilbur. He could use some clothes.
He is a goddamn psychiatrist--of *course* he wants to "help"! He'd be happy if he could help *commit* me!
It's that Mrs. Goodhall you have to be careful of, Wilbur.
It's that Mrs. Goodhall you have to be careful of, Wilbur.
One has to be more than "careful" of Mrs. Goodhall--she has sufficient Christian zeal to start her own country! I'd like to give her a little ether.
This is *your* life story, Wilbur! You just changed the dates!
"An internship and two years of training at the Boston Lying-in, South End Branch. For his age, he was judged an accomplished gynecological obstetrical surgeon; he is also experienced in pediatric care..."

You *invented* him! You've completely made his up!
Don't you understand? The board is going to *replace* me! That's what the "new blood" is *for*!
These *credentials* are against the law!
We all know who trained Homer--his credentials are as good as mine are. Don't you be holy to me about the *law*! What has the law done for any of us here?
Oh my, yes! This is a *far* superior taste--and crisp, too! You know, so many apples are disappointingly mealy. I wonder of most of the apples in my life weren't meant for pies!
Wilbur, he picked them for us himself...
Wilbur, he picked them for us himself...
You don't find it depressing that Homer Wells is picking apples?
I suppose it wouldn't hurt to *meet* him. What's his name again?
Dr. Homer Wells.
Dr. Homer Wells.
I just hope he won't expect us to say *Grace* all the time.
He *sniffs* that ether! I've seen him do it!
It's because he's too tired to sleep. He has to.
It's because he's too tired to sleep. He has to.
He *smells* like he could put you to sleep!

He's a doctor, Buster--doctors smell like ether.

*You're* a doctor, Homer--you don't smell like ether.
*You're* a doctor, Homer--you don't smell like ether.
I'm *not* a doctor. I haven't been to medical school--I haven't even been to high school!

But you've studied with the old man for *years*!

I'm sorry, Homer.
I mean your parents.
I know who you mean. I think about leaving here, but not to find *them*.
I know who you mean. I think about leaving here, but not to find *them*.
Why not?
Why not?
Whoever they were, they didn't *do* any of the things parents are supposed to do. Dr. Larch did those things, and Nurse Edna, and Nurse Angela.

What for, Buster? What would you do if you met them?

Uh... I'd like to show them that I can cook, a little.
Uh... I'd like to show them that I can cook, a little.
You cook very well!
You cook very well!
And that I can drive a truck!
And that I can drive a truck!
Better than I can!
Better than I can!
Sometimes I want to meet them so I can kill them. Just sometimes.
Homer, you know I would never kill anyone--you know I wouldn't.
I know.
I think Mary Agnes could kill someone.
I doubt it. She's just an...
What's she so emotional about?
I don't know. She got left here, like the rest of us, didn't she?
What'd she die of?
She died of *secrecy*, she died of *ignorance*...
What are you going to tell the little ones?
I'll tell them Fuzzy was adopted.
I'll tell them Fuzzy was adopted.
Why would the little ones believe that *anyone* would adopt him?
Why would the little ones believe that *anyone* would adopt him?
They'll believe it because they want to believe it.
They'll believe it because they want to believe it.
Shouldn't we tell Homer?
Shouldn't we tell Homer?
If Homer wanted to know what was happening here, he could pick up a telephone and call us.
It's time somebody ate *them*.
I was lookin' for Wally's letter. I was gonna show it to Homer... They made him a captain already-- *Captain* Worthington!
I was lookin' for Wally's letter. I was gonna show it to Homer... They made him a captain already-- *Captain* Worthington!
Daddy, it's a letter to *me*.
Daddy, it's a letter to *me*.
He mentions Homer, too, you know.
He mentions Homer, too, you know.
Wally said to say, "Hello."
It's gettin' late. I think I'll pack it in.
Good night, Daddy.
How about him not needin' the friggin' compass! How about that?
Daddy, *please*...
Good night, kids. Don't catch cold-- it's gettin' cold already.
Good night, Daddy.
So, Mrs...
Candy. Candy Kendall.
How many months are you?
Two.
Is your family in the apple business, too?
No, but I work there--I like it. My dad's a lobsterman.
No, but I work there--I like it. My dad's a lobsterman.
I've never seen a lobster.

I've never seen the ocean, either.

Oh...
Oh...
I can't have a baby alone. I don't even know if he's coming back!
I can't have a baby alone. I don't even know if he's coming back!
I understand.
I'm a little worried about the... ...about how much bleeding is okay.
It should taper off tomorrow, but it can come back again. You have cramps? They'll ease up, almost entirely. As long as the bleeding isn't heavy, it's normal.
I guess I'll see you around the orchards. Thanks for everything.
Sure... I'll see you around.
So. Not bored yet?
I'm *never* bored! It's all very... different for me... here.
Uh... have you been *feeling* okay?
When I'm not thinking about Wally. I'm not good at being alone. Oh, goodness. You meant... yes, I'm fine. I... ...I don't suppose you've seen a lobster yet.
You have to come to my dad's lobster pound and see one, then.
Okay...
I better go.
I don't think Mr. Rose would leave without you.
A movie *outside*?
Yes. But it's closed all the time now, because of the blackout.
Yes. But it's closed all the time now, because of the blackout.
People watched the movies in their cars?
People watched the movies in their cars?
When they watched at all. Do you like movies?
When they watched at all. Do you like movies?
Yes! I've only seen one, though.
You've seen only one movie? Which one?
"King Kong". It's really good.
But you looked as if you liked it.
I *did* like it. All I said was, "It's not 'King Kong'."
First she loved him, then she didn't, then no one else could have him...
She *did* love him! How many women have you known?
And what did she die of, exactly?
She was torn apart! She died of a broken heart.
She was torn apart! She died of a broken heart.
Oh, sure!
What's the *medical* explanation?
Well, she was in a weakened condition... I don't know! What about "King Kong"?! Is that medically possible?
You're a natural. You were born to drive a car like this.
You think? Maybe I was. I love this place!
The screen is enormous! Imagine King Kong up *there*! Have you seen a lot of movies here?
Yes... and no. When you come here, you don't really care about the movie.
What are you so crazy about the movies for?
It was my favorite night at the orphanage--movie night. We'd race into the dining hall. Of course everyone wanted to sit in front, so we'd be packed in so tight you could feel the kid next to you breathing.

At least you were never lonely.
At least you were never lonely.
I didn't say that. Growing up in an orphanage, you're always lonely. You're just never alone.
You don't miss it?
I miss things. I miss... people. I miss reading to the boys.
I miss things. I miss... people. I miss reading to the boys.
But you had so much *responsibility*.
But you had so much *responsibility*.
I never *asked* for any responsibility.
I never *asked* for any responsibility.
Just a little privacy.
Privacy is exactly the point of drive- in movies.
Did you come here with Wally--to *not* watch movies?
Sometimes... movies mostly bore Wally.
Ah-ha. So what is that--a radio?
Ah-ha. So what is that--a radio?
The *speaker*. For the movie sound.
How could you not *care* about the movie?
You just cuddle. You come to hug... to kiss. You don't *come* here to watch the movie.
You just cuddle. You come to hug... to kiss. You don't *come* here to watch the movie.
That's what *I'd* come here for. I'd watch the movie.
That's what *I'd* come here for. I'd watch the movie.
Not with the right girl you wouldn't.
Aren't you worried that people will cut their feet?
Nobody will swim here until next summer. By then, the water will have rubbed the glass smooth against the sand--there won't be any sharp edges.
I *know* this was right.
Right.
Just tell me. Do you want me to go? Do you want me to stay?
It will be okay.
It will be okay.
*What* will be okay?
*What* will be okay?
We have to wait and see. I think that, for *everything* in life, you have to wait and see.
Olive told me. You might have told me yourself.
I'm just waiting and seeing. Like you said.
Do you think I'm having a good time? Do you think I'm just *teasing* you? Do you think I *know* whether I want you or Wally?
So we should "wait and see." For how long?
So we should "wait and see." For how long?
I grew up with Wally. I began my adult life with him.
I grew up with Wally. I began my adult life with him.
Fine. That's all there is to it then.
Fine. That's all there is to it then.
No! That's not all there is to it! I love you, too--I *know* I do.
No! That's not all there is to it! I love you, too--I *know* I do.
Okay, okay--I know you do, too.
Okay, okay--I know you do, too.
It's a good thing I didn't have that baby, isn't it?
We should take her to St. Cloud's. That much is obvious, isn't it? Let her make up her mind when she gets there...
I told her! She doesn't feel she can do that. Something about her father not letting her go anywhere...
I told her! She doesn't feel she can do that. Something about her father not letting her go anywhere...
Well, we have to help her!
She won't go to St. Cloud's!
Well, we can't force her. It's her decision.
Well, we can't force her. It's her decision.
You don't understand! It's her father...
You don't understand! It's her father...
Mr. Rose *knows*?
Mr. Rose *knows*?
He's the *father*! He's her baby's father!
Wait... *wait*! Are you sure?
We've got to keep her away from that bastard!
Just tell me. I'll do whatever you want to do.
Nothing.
Nothing.
Isn't that like waiting and seeing?
Isn't that like waiting and seeing?
No. Nothing is nothing. I want Wally to come home. I'm afraid to see him, too.
No. Nothing is nothing. I want Wally to come home. I'm afraid to see him, too.
I know. Is *that* nothing.
I know. Is *that* nothing.
No, don't--that's something. Nothing is nothing. Don't even look at me. I want...
Please don't move, don't go anywhere.
*Go* anywhere? Of course not! That would be *doing* something, wouldn't it? We wouldn't want to *do* something. Let's just sit here all night!
*Go* anywhere? Of course not! That would be *doing* something, wouldn't it? We wouldn't want to *do* something. Let's just sit here all night!
If you're trying to be funny, Homer...
If you're trying to be funny, Homer...
I'm not trying to be anything--I'm just doing nothing! If I wait and see long enough, then--with any luck-- I won't *ever* have to make up my mind! Decisions can be painful, after all...
Stop it! Just cut it out!
You got up! You *did* something! If you keep this up, you might be in danger of making a *decision*!
You got up! You *did* something! If you keep this up, you might be in danger of making a *decision*!
For God's sake, Homer, Wally's been shot down!
I know, I'm sorry.
He's *paralyzed*!
He's *paralyzed*!
He's *alive*. He still loves you. So do I.
He's *alive*. He still loves you. So do I.
What do you want me to *do*?
Please don't make me say it again.
No, that's not it--I just want to be sure I understand you.
I *helped* you not to think about Wally. You were so upset--you couldn't stand worrying about him, about his being killed and not coming back-- but when you were with me, you could stop worrying... well, for a while, anyway. This is how I helped you, right?
Please... that's enough. I *loved* you, too--you know I did.
Please... that's enough. I *loved* you, too--you know I did.
"...did." Well, okay.
"...did." Well, okay.
Please don't...
Please don't...
And now that Wally's coming back, and because he'll certainly *need* you...
And now that Wally's coming back, and because he'll certainly *need* you...
You say that as though it's some awful thing! I never stopped loving Wally!
Do you think she'll be all right?
She knows how to take care of herself.
This came for you a couple of days ago. Olive asked me to bring it. With everything happening, I guess she forgot.
Sure. Thanks.
I know you don't think much of being needed, or of me for that matter...
I'm sorry for what I said about Wally needing you. It was... unnecessary.
I'm sorry for what I said about Wally needing you. It was... unnecessary.
No, I'm the one who should be sorry. You have every right to be angry.
No, I'm the one who should be sorry. You have every right to be angry.
No. You warned me. I didn't listen, but you warned me.
How is that Wally doing?
Oh, he's fine! I just heard from him. He's bombing all these places...
Hi...
Hi...
I've got some more clothes for you-- I just keep forgetting to bring them with me.
I don't need no more clothes, thank you.
I don't need no more clothes, thank you.
Rose, I know what's going on. Homer told me. I got pregnant, too--about a year ago. I've been through this.
You ain't been through what I been through, Candy.
Yes, I *have*!
I know where you can go. Homer and I can take you...
I can't go nowhere.
I can't go nowhere.
Why?
You can trust me. Is it Jack? It's not Jack, is it? It's *Muddy*! Is it Muddy?
No. It ain't Muddy. Muddy's just...
So many children. Are they all orphans?
Well, this *is* an orphanage.
I'm okay--I can walk.
I don't want you to walk--I want to carry you. Should I put the top up? It might get cold.
I don't want you to walk--I want to carry you. Should I put the top up? It might get cold.
No--keep it down. I want to feel the air.
Wally thinks apples are boring.
I never said they were boring.
I never said they were boring.
You said, "Apples aren't exactly flying."
You said, "Apples aren't exactly flying."
Well, they aren't.
There! You said it was boring.
Well, *picking* them is! It's about as exciting as... walking!
I love you, Wally.
I love you, too. See you tomorrow.
I was just showing Homer the orchards... kind of a geography lesson.
I know what you've been doing.
You've been giving him a *flying* lesson!
He *loved* it! Didn't you?
He thinks people *like* to get whacked by branches.
*Homer* liked it! Didn't you?
I thought they might take me.
They wanted a girl.
They wanted a girl.
Nobody ever wants me!
You're one of the best, Curly--we couldn't let just anyone take you.
Dr. Larch wouldn't let just anyone take *any* of us!
Dr. Larch wouldn't let just anyone take *any* of us!
That's true.
That's true.
Nobody's asked for me, have they?
Nobody's asked for me, have they?
Nobody special enough, Curly.
Nobody special enough, Curly.
You mean somebody asked?
You mean somebody asked?
Only the right people can have you, Curly.
Her temperature is a hundred and four.
How old are you, dear? Thirteen?
That's a heavy sedation.
You *bet* it's a heavy sedation! The fetus is unexpelled, her uterus is punctured, she has acute peritonitis, and there's a foreign object. I think it's a crochet hook.
I don't know! He's just leaving-- you're the one who says he needs to see the world! *That's* what he'll do--he'll see the world!
He's leaving...
"Homer Wells, born Portland, Maine, March 2, 1915..."
Homer was born *here*, in, what was it, 1922?
Homer was born *here*, in, what was it, 1922?
"...graduated Bowdoin College, 1935, and Harvard School of Medicine, 1939."
You mean they'll replace you with someone who won't perform abortions.
Well, we can only guess about that, Edna. They *are* against the law.
So here is my candidate. What do you think?
But what about school records? Homer doesn't have any *diplomas*...
Or that he can't be bothered to write us a proper letter? A dissertation on apples, we don't need!
He probably doesn't make much money picking apples--he must have had to pay to send them, too.
He probably doesn't make much money picking apples--he must have had to pay to send them, too.
I wouldn't worry, Edna, that he doesn't have money. If he gets hungry, he can pick his dinner!
I just wanted to ask you...
Edna! Come dance with me! Let's be foolish tonight.
Edna! Come dance with me! Let's be foolish tonight.
Does he *know* he's supposed to be in India? Does he even *want* to come back?
Is *your* father dead?
Cirrhosis--it's a disease of the liver.
Cirrhosis--it's a disease of the liver.
*Liver* killed him?
*Liver* killed him?
*Alcohol* killed him--he drank himself to death.
*Alcohol* killed him--he drank himself to death.
But did you know him?
But did you know him?
Barely. It hardly mattered that I knew him.
Barely. It hardly mattered that I knew him.
Did you know your mother better?
Did you know your mother better?
She's dead now, too. She was a nanny.
She's dead now, too. She was a nanny.
What's a nanny do?
What's a nanny do?
She looks after other people's children.
She looks after other people's children.
Did you grow up around here?
Did you grow up around here?
No. She was an immigrant.
No. She was an immigrant.
What's an immigrant?
What's an immigrant?
Someone not from Maine.
Homer... doesn't King Kong think the woman is his *mother*?
Uh, sure--that's what Kong thinks, all right.
Uh, sure--that's what Kong thinks, all right.
That's why Kong loves her!
"I was a posthumous child. My father's eyes had closed upon the light of this world six months, when mine opened on it."
His father's dead, right?
Uh... it's the end of October.
Is that soon?
Don't get too excited, Fuzzy.
Why can't we have pumpkins for Christmas, too? We don't get any good presents at Christmas, anyway.
Did you bite it?
I don't remember.
I don't remember.
It looks like you bit it--it'll be all right.
It looks like you bit it--it'll be all right.
Maybe I was kissing someone and he bit me.
Maybe I was kissing someone and he bit me.
No, you did it yourself. Maybe in your sleep.
No, you did it yourself. Maybe in your sleep.
I must have been *dreaming* of kissing someone.
I'm sorry. They're not used to seeing a car like this.
It's okay--I don't mind.
So, now, uh... you're not... I mean, do *you* do the--
No. Dr. Larch will be performing the procedure.
No. Dr. Larch will be performing the procedure.
Ah, well... okay. Good! I just wondered...
What kind of plane are you flying?
A B-24 Liberator.
A B-24 Liberator.
Liberator...
Liberator...
Have you enlisted?
Have you enlisted?
They wouldn't take me. I'm Class IV-- I've got a heart defect.
They wouldn't take me. I'm Class IV-- I've got a heart defect.
Really! Is it serious?
Really! Is it serious?
No, it's not serious. I'm just not supposed to get excited. You know-- no strain, no stress. I try to keep calm all the time.
Has anyone offered you anything to eat?
Actually, someone did. I just didn't think I could eat anything.
I wonder if you might give me a ride.
Sure! Be glad to! Uh... a ride where?
Sure! Be glad to! Uh... a ride where?
Where are you going?
Where are you going?
We're heading back to Cape Kenneth.
I think I'd probably like the apple business.
You're a little overqualified, aren't you?
You're a little overqualified, aren't you?
No, I'm not. I need a job.
No, I'm not. I need a job.
The only jobs are picking jobs. Picking apples is truly boring.
This is all normal. Don't worry. The abortion procedure... it affects you. It's the ether, too. It'll take a little time.
I don't *have* any time. There's a *war*!
I don't *have* any time. There's a *war*!
It's all very normal.
"Burma run" because you fly over Burma...
*And* over the Himalayas. That's called flying over the hump.
At what altitude?
I've got thirty-five minutes to climb to fifteen thousand feet--that's the first mountain pass.
What lousy luck--I mean your orders... to draw an assignment like that!
Actually, I volunteered.
Uh, look... if you're serious about wanting a job, picking apples isn't that boring.
Oh, I would love that, Wally.
They're migrants.
Migrants?
Migrants?
Yes. They pick fruit, all kinds. They travel up and down the coast with the seasons. The trick to Mr. Rose is, you have to let him be the boss.
It's almost like flying.
What about the trees?
What about the trees?
The trees are flak--antiaircraft fire from those geeks on the ground.
Uh... I'm shipping out sooner than I thought. I just wanted to be sure you were settled in--and happy enough, considering... Are you bored stiff? Or can you stick it out for a bit?
Uh... actually, picking apples is as much excitement as I want for a while. I'm grateful for the job.
Uh... actually, picking apples is as much excitement as I want for a while. I'm grateful for the job.
You're the one who's helping *me*, Homer. You're going to give my mom a little peace of mind while I'm gone. Candy, too.
You're the one who's helping *me*, Homer. You're going to give my mom a little peace of mind while I'm gone. Candy, too.
Well, sure... that's good, then. All I mean is, I'm lucky I met you.
Well, sure... that's good, then. All I mean is, I'm lucky I met you.
I don't think so, Homer. *I'm* the lucky one.
So. What should I do now?
Out back, there's a shed. It's just a mess. If that shed was better organized, I could put my truck in there.
It's big enough to keep you out of the war, I suppose. Ain't that right?
Right.
Stop it, Homer. They aren't our rules. We didn't write them. I don't see no reason to read them.
Okay...
That's better. I can tell you got yourself some education. Them's good hands you got, Homer. Them hands you got, they know what they're doin'-- ain't that right?
I guess so...
Are we supposed to be up here? The rules said...
Homer, you the only one who's read them rules, so you the only one who feels like he's doin' somethin' wrong.
Cider don't have no taste till later in October--it's too watery now, when we're usin' just them early Macs and them Gravensteins. You don't get no *good* cider till you're pickin' them Golden Delicious and them Winter Bananas, them Baldwins and them Russerts...
What about the worms? Most of these apples are the drops--off the ground, right? There have to be worms.
What about the worms? Most of these apples are the drops--off the ground, right? There have to be worms.
Of *course* there's worms, Homer! And what is them worms, really? They just *protein*, them worms! They is *good* for you!
Slow down, Homer--don't be in such a big hurry.
This is easy--I'm not hurrying.
This is easy--I'm not hurrying.
You still doin' it too fast!
I didn't see where you was pickin' this mornin', Homer, but you musta worked up a big appetite. You look like you're serious about gettin' to your lunch today!
Is it true?
I think you been stayin' up too late at night, Homer.
You're actually having sex with your own little girl? Is that possible?
You're actually having sex with your own little girl? Is that possible?
Ain't nobody havin' *sex* with my little girl, Homer--that's somethin' a father knows.
Ain't nobody havin' *sex* with my little girl, Homer--that's somethin' a father knows.
You're lying. How can you... with your own daughter!
Homer, don't you know what business you in? You don't wanna go into no business with me, Homer--ain't that right?
Go on, cut my clothes. I've got other clothes.
But she's your *daughter*...
And I *love* her! There ain't nobody else gonna treat her as good as I do! I wouldn't do nothin' to hurt her, Homer--you must know that.
Please listen to me! *Both* of you...
You forget yourself, Homer. This here's my daughter! You got your own mess to deal with--ain't that right?
What business is you in, Homer?
Mr. Rose, I'm in the *doctor* business. If you want, I can help you. You don't have to go anywhere.
What's that? What's it called?
One cervical stabilizer, two sets of dilators--Douglas points. One medium- sized curette, one small; one medium speculum, one large; two vulsellum forceps.
One cervical stabilizer, two sets of dilators--Douglas points. One medium- sized curette, one small; one medium speculum, one large; two vulsellum forceps.
There ain't no *almost* about this stuff, Homer--ain't that right?
Merthiolate, ether, vulval pads, gauze--lots of gauze.
When it comes to this, you is the real thing--is that what you sayin'?
I'm stayin', Homer.
Okay. Then you can be of use.
If that was your knife, Muddy, I wanna thank you for givin' it to her-- no girl should be goin' *hitch-hikin'* if she don't got a good knife with her.
Where'd she get you?
Where'd she get you?
She just plan misunderstand me--I was tryin' to give her my knife, I was just reachin' to touch her hand. But I understand if she misunderstand me--it's all my fault, ain't that right?
There's more than one laceration, more than one cut.
That's 'cause I sticked my *own* knife in the wound--after she go, I sticked my *own* knife in there. I poked it all around, I just tryin' to find the same place she got me.
Let me hear you say that! I so unhappy she runned away that I killed myself-- that what happen here, ain't that right?
Right?
First pregnancy?
Yes, for both.
Yes, for both.
I presume you'd prefer handling the delivery.

All I said was, I don't want to perform abortions. I have no argument with *you* performing them.
All I said was, I don't want to perform abortions. I have no argument with *you* performing them.
You know *how* to help these women-- how can you not feel *obligated* to help them when they can't get help anywhere else?
You know *how* to help these women-- how can you not feel *obligated* to help them when they can't get help anywhere else?
One: it's illegal. Two: I didn't ask how to do it--you just showed me.
One: it's illegal. Two: I didn't ask how to do it--you just showed me.
What *else* could I have showed you, Homer? The only thing I can teach you is what I know! In every life, you've got to be of use.
There was no visible wound?
No. The fetus was dead. Her uterus was virtually *disintegrating*--my stitches pulled right through the tissue!
No. The fetus was dead. Her uterus was virtually *disintegrating*--my stitches pulled right through the tissue!
It looks like scurvy.
It looks like scurvy.
Scurvy! Ah yes, the curse of the old- time sailor, suffering long periods at sea with no fresh fruits or vegetables. Homer, Dorothy isn't a *sailor*!
It's obviously an aborticide.
Obviously.
Christ, it's oil of tansy!
I don't know it.
I don't know it.
If you take enough of it, your intestines lose their ability to absorb Vitamin C.

In other words, scurvy.

Good boy. Good job. And you call yourself "not a doctor"! Keep an eye on her--she's in trouble.
Fuzzy is not uncommon. I tell you, there's something about the premature babies of alcoholic mothers. They seem susceptible to every damn thing that comes along.
I haven't read that.
I haven't read that.
I haven't, either. But you *will*. The morons who write the books should do a little research *here*.
I haven't, either. But you *will*. The morons who write the books should do a little research *here*.
But isn't Fuzzy just... well, underdeveloped?
But isn't Fuzzy just... well, underdeveloped?
When *doesn't* he have bronchitis? I wouldn't call his bronchial infections "underdeveloped." Would you?
Where's the name sheet?
Nobody's named this one yet.
Nobody's named this one yet.
It's my turn!
He doesn't like it. He's a boy, That's why.
Can't a boy be a Dorrit?
Can't a boy be a Dorrit?
I don't think so.
I don't think so.
You do it then.
Henceforth you shall be... Little Wilbur.
I'm not crazy about the "Little..."
Okay, he's just a Wilbur then.
We haven't had a Wilbur here in a year or so, have we? We used to have *dozens*!
I thought you took care of this. It always breaks in the same place. It's your splice, isn't it?
It's *your* splice! You blame me for everything!
I thought it was my turn.
It is. I'll get this. You go ahead.
How about expecting people to be responsible enough to control themselves to begin with?
How about this child? You expect *her* to be responsible?
It's just a marvel to me that you still have such high expectations of people.
I'm happy I amuse you.
I'm happy I amuse you.
Try to look at it this way. What choice does Buster have? What are his options? Nobody will ever adopt him.
Try to look at it this way. What choice does Buster have? What are his options? Nobody will ever adopt him.
Try to look at it *this* way. Buster and I are sitting right here beside you. We could have ended up in the incinerator!
Try to look at it *this* way. Buster and I are sitting right here beside you. We could have ended up in the incinerator!
Happy to be alive, under any circumstances--is that your point?
Doubtless you'll let me know what immensely worthwhile or at least *useful* thing it is that you find to do.
I wasn't intending to leave here in order to be entirely useless--I expect I'll find some ways to be of use.
I wasn't intending to leave here in order to be entirely useless--I expect I'll find some ways to be of use.
In other parts of the world, I suppose there are other ways.
In other parts of the world, I suppose there are other ways.
Of course.
Of course.
Are you really so *stupid* that you imagine you're going to find a more gratifying life? What you're going to find is people like the poor people who get left here--only nobody takes care of them as well! And you won't be able to take care of them, either. There's no taking care of *anybody*-- not out there!

You know I'm grateful for everything you've done for me...
You know I'm grateful for everything you've done for me...
I don't need your gratitude.
I don't need this--I know all about my condition.
It's your heart--you ought to take it with you.
I am not a doctor.
You know everything I know, plus what you've taught yourself--you're a better doctor then I am and you know it!
What I mean is... I would like it very much if you thought you could be happy here, Homer.
Mrs. Worthington, I feel I'm very lucky to be here.
Mrs. Worthington, I feel I'm very lucky to be here.
There's not a lot of work in the winter, and you'll have to tolerate Vernon--even Wally despises him, and Wally likes everyone.
I think Wally will be fine, Mrs. Worthington--he seems indestructible to me.
I don't know. Just promise me one thing.
Uh... sure.
Just promise me that, if there's a blizzard, you'll move into Wally's room until it's over.
Good-bye, Arthur. Homer, I'll see you tomorrow?
Right.
Don't mess in this, Homer, if you know what's good for you.
How long's this been going on, Muddy?
How long's this been going on, Muddy?
Long enough. You ain't gonna stop it.
"One: Please don't smoke in bed."
We heard that one already, Homer.
We heard that one already, Homer.
"Two: Please don't go up to the roof to eat your lunch."
Thanks, guys... I'd like to go with you. But I've got to move on.
Yeah, well... you could move on with *us*, man! You could move on somewhere *warm*!
Rose Rose?
Pretty, ain't it? You a plumber?
What's that?
It's just my heart.
It's just my heart.
What you got a picture of your heart for?
There's a little something wrong with it. Just this part here--the right ventricle. It's slightly enlarged.
So what?
So what?
Yes, so what. It's nothing serious, really. Just a small defect.
Do you like to read?
I can't read. Nobody taught me.
You ain't gettin' in no trouble, I hope.
No trouble.
I'm not in trouble.
Yeah, you is. I know when people is in trouble, and you is.
Give men that. I know how to do it.
Oh, I suppose you is a doctor, Homer?
Oh, I suppose you is a doctor, Homer?
Almost.
You okay, Rose?
I guess you must like watchin' me be sick...
I guess you must like watchin' me be sick...
I don't like watching anyone be sick.
You're not yet three months, are you?
Not yet. What do you know about it?
Not yet. What do you know about it?
I know more than I want to know about it. Who's the father?
I know more than I want to know about it. Who's the father?
Don't trouble yourself about it, Homer--this ain't your business.
Don't trouble yourself about it, Homer--this ain't your business.
But you don't look very happy.
But you don't look very happy.
*Happy*! What are you thinkin'? How am I supposed to take care of a baby! I can't have a baby.
*Happy*! What are you thinkin'? How am I supposed to take care of a baby! I can't have a baby.
Rose, please listen. Whatever you want to do, I can help you.
What I mean is, if you don't want to... keep the baby, I know a place where you can go.
You think Daddy's gonna let me go anywhere? I ain't going *nowhere*.
Why don't you just go back to your pickin', Homer? I can take care of it myself!
Rose, listen--don't *do* anything. You know, I mean to yourself. Please listen...
That's *it*?
That's it.
That's it.
It means nothin' at all! And all this time I been *wonderin'* about it!
Who cares?
Now, now. He's a good boy.
Now, now. He's a good boy.
Shit. We don't know what he is.
Shit. We don't know what he is.
Jack, you gotta watch your language 'round my daughter.
I bet the view looks better from the Worthin'tons'.
You think so, Jack? Well... I wouldn't want to be in that Wally's shoes tonight.
That just ain't right, Jack--your cigarette's gonna end up in nine or ten gallons of this batch of cider! That ain't right.
Them people drinkin' that cider, they don't know there's a cigarette in there!
Them people drinkin' that cider, they don't know there's a cigarette in there!
It's not that hard to find it in there, Jack--it'll take you just a minute. You just gotta go fishin'.
It's not that hard to find it in there, Jack--it'll take you just a minute. You just gotta go fishin'.
You mean *swimmin'*. I ain't goin' in that vat to fish out no cigarette!
You mean *swimmin'*. I ain't goin' in that vat to fish out no cigarette!
What business is you in, Jack? Just tell me what your business is...
Do you know him?
*No*! I don't want to know him! He's doing *missionary* work--in *India*! I wrote him *weeks* ago, but he's either too holy or too busy to answer. Maybe he got killed in the war!
I fail to see how someone courageous enough to make a commitment to a foreign mission is automatically to be dismissed--that part of the world requires precisely the kind of dedication that is needed here.
Does it *snow* in Bombay? One winter here and we'll be shipping him south, in a *coffin*!
Does it *snow* in Bombay? One winter here and we'll be shipping him south, in a *coffin*!
You can't think that a man who has *served* under such conditions as exist over there will be in the slightest daunted by a little *snow*-- have you no idea how harsh and primitive and full of *disease* that part of the world is?
You can't think that a man who has *served* under such conditions as exist over there will be in the slightest daunted by a little *snow*-- have you no idea how harsh and primitive and full of *disease* that part of the world is?
Then I suppose we can look forward to catching various diseases from him!
I fail to see how a little Christianity could *hurt* anyone here!
Anyway, I was just showing you this guy as an example of what's available-- I didn't think you'd be interested.
When the plane was hit, the crew chief and the radioman jumped close together. The copilot jumped third. All on Captain Worthington's orders-- the captain was still flying the plane. None of the men of the ground could see the sky--that's how thick the jungle was. They never saw the plane crash--they never *heard* it crash. They never saw Captain Worthington's parachute, either.
Why was he missing for twenty days?
Why was he missing for twenty days?
Because the crew thought he'd gone down with the plane. They were hospitalized for almost a week in China before they were flown back to India. It wasn't until that they sorted through their gear...
Then it's malaria?
It's encephalitis B. He's recovering at Mount Lavinia Hospital, Ceylon. Uh... Captain Worthington is paralyzed. Waist down. He won't walk.
No autonomic effects... that's correct.
When will he be home, Major?
When will he be home, Major?
Four weeks or so, right around Halloween.
They told me I was too old to serve.
They told Muddy his feet was too flat!
Ain't you gonna see what it is, Homer?
Mind your own business, Peaches.
Mind your own business, Peaches.
Sorry, Homer...
You all take care of yourself, too, Homer!
We see you next harvest.
Don't this place look like home?
It look nicer then home!
It look nicer then home!
What have you two been doin' to make it look so nice?
You pickin' nothin' but cider apples, Peaches--I hope you understand that.
They ain't drops--I picked 'em off the tree!
They ain't drops--I picked 'em off the tree!
Then you pickin' 'em too fast--they ain't no better than drops to me. See that bruise, and that one? *Half* of these is bruised! Look at this one! It ain't got no stem! You might as well *step* on 'em, too--they only good for cider.
They're *outrageous*, them rules!
Who *live* here in this cider house, Peaches? Who grind them apples, who press that cider, who clean up the mess, and who just plain *live* here... just breathin' in the vinegar? Somebody who *don't* live here made them rules. Them rules ain't for *us*. *We* the ones who make up them rules. We makin' our *own* rules, every day. Ain't that right, Homer?
Where's your manners? Make room for Homer, so's he can enjoy the view.
What view?
*What* view?
Well, Muddy, we can look at all these angry stars Homer's been readin' to us about.
Don't let us make you nervous or nothin'--we know you gotta job to do.
Yeah, we can wait all night for the water to come back on--you just go on and take your time.
It's that Vernon--he keeps askin' where you and Homer and Rose Rose is at.
Tell that Vernon to mind his own business, Muddy.
Tell that Vernon to mind his own business, Muddy.
I told him that you all is sick.
I told him that you all is sick.
Tell him what you want, Muddy--*you* is the crew boss today.
She's *good* with that knife! She's real fast. She's a lot better with that knife than *you* is, Muddy! And who do you suppose taught her?
*You* taught her, I suppose...
*You* taught her, I suppose...
That's right! A girl's gotta know how to defend herself, don't she?
That what happen--you lost you only daughter so's you killed yourself! That's what we say, all right.
That's right. I know you understand how I feel, Homer--you is breakin' them rules, too. Ain't that right?
Daddy, I'd like to be in that Wally's shoes *every* night.
You lucky you in your work boots tonight, girl...
You lucky you in your work boots tonight, girl...
What's lucky about that?
That sounds like you is in trouble already, Homer.
That's right--that sounds like trouble to me.
We should drown that damn Jack in the vat!
Now, now, darlin'... Jack just needs to know what business he's in.
Now, now, darlin'... Jack just needs to know what business he's in.
Yeah, you really showed him, Daddy-- you just about cut your own hand off, and all you cut off *him* was his clothes!
Yeah, you really showed him, Daddy-- you just about cut your own hand off, and all you cut off *him* was his clothes!
You oughta know you don't go to jail for cuttin' a guy's *clothes*. Ain't that right, Homer?
Now, now, Jack--that just ain't right.
You just stay out of trouble, Homer!
Where do you think you're going?
You gotta let me go, Daddy. Please...
You ain't goin' nowhere in the middle of the night, girl!
I ain't your business no more, Daddy. Please let me go.
You just go inside, Homer. We don't need no help.
That's right, Homer. This ain't your business.
That Candy--she's the nicest girl I know!
She's about the most beautiful girl I ever seen--I don't know if she's the nicest.
You're lucky he didn't cut your *nipples* off, man.
The good news, Jack, is you're half- undressed for *swimmin'*...
The good news, Jack, is you're half- undressed for *swimmin'*...
Yeah, that cigarette ain't hard to find when you're properly undressed.
Rose Rose has runned away!
She took off in the night!
She took off in the night!
She took off on the bicycle, man.
You ever see a palm tree, Homer?
He ain't never been outta Maine!
But I'm not that late. You didn't have to give away my seat.
I wasn't sure if you'd make it.
Thanks for playing along. I just have to sit for a while.
Tough day?
Tough day?
Brutal day. They say the streets are lined with money down here, but I guess you have to know the secret handshake. What are you drinking?
Brutal day. They say the streets are lined with money down here, but I guess you have to know the secret handshake. What are you drinking?
Uh, Maker's Mark. Rocks.
My name's Grant. Grant Ashby.
Oh god. I'm overbearing and rude. Lily. Lily Finn.
So, what do you do?
It's more like what aren't I doing. My partners and I are trying to secure start up capital for a small tech company. We tried the venture capitalist route in the Valley, but then again who hasn't up there.

Silicon Valley?
Silicon Valley?
That's right. So, brainiacs that we are, we thought we'd be innovative and relocate east. Try our luck with a straight corporate loan out here.
Can --
On me. For the seat. Cheers.
So we've been meeting with banks all day. It's amazing how many ways they can say "no" without ever using the word.
Well, typically, corporate loans are relatively simple matters, but you do need to demonstrate a capacity for gross fund recovery.
Don't tell me you started a tech firm here before us.
No, no. Nothing like that. I work in a bank.
No, no. Nothing like that. I work in a bank.
Really? Wish we had met eight hours ago.
Oh. Well, thanks for the drink.
You're welcome. I was just going to ask you if you'd like to join us.
Uh, right... And that was it. That's when we decided to start our own business. No more shithead bosses.
I envy you guys. Taking a chance like that.
What do you do over at your bank, Grant?
What do I do? I'm the VP of Finance.
Here's where a little research comes in handy. Corporate banks give out VP titles like calendars. It's a small lie, but now we're sure he's playing.
Maybe you can help us understand what's so hard about getting a corporate loan.

Well, typically speaking, they're not. As long as you can demonstrate --

A capacity for gross fund recovery. Yeah, we got that part.

That's right. And tech firms... They 'tend to scare people off.

They scare people off because most people lack vision. Vision and balls. Present company excluded of course.

Banks need to know how they're going to get their money back.

We know exactly how we're going to make the money back. There in lies the Catch-22

I don't follow.
Listen, what I'm about to tell you, I'm telling you in confidence, okay? Have you ever heard of a company called Big.Com?
Big.Com. That Internet thing.
Big.Com. That Internet thing.
Right. The guys who started that did what a lot of companies in the Valley do. They get a good idea, shop it around, raise some capital, then sell it off to a bigger company. Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, whatever. The beauty of it is, they've pretty much sold the company before they're even real. The bigger company is already set to buy it, all

Sort of like a letter of intent.
Sort of like a letter of intent.
Exactly. But the Catch-22 is that you can't tell anyone about the offer, because if it's public, you could start a bidding war and that's considered a breach of etiquette. It could kill a deal. But, wait too long and you're not considered hot anymore.

And you have this letter of intent?
And you have this letter of intent?
Yes. That's why I wish there were guys willing to take a chance and live a little.
We had to finalize the deal.
Everything looks in order.
Everything looks in order.
This has to happen fast.
This has to happen fast.
I know. It won't go unnoticed.
I know. It won't go unnoticed.
There'll be red flags.
What's this?
You need some convincing. Consider it a convincer.
Let's just slow down for a second...
You're worried about recouping the loan. I already told you.
You're worried about recouping the loan. I already told you.
No, I understand that. What I mean... What I'm trying to say... I was actually wondering about... Well, my cut.
Then there it is. Ashby gets the itch.
The standard ten.
The standard ten.
Ten percent. Of how much?
Ten percent. Of how much?
Two million.
Same thing with playing a con. You have to be able to see that deep.
Jake? Right. Uh-huh... Uh-huh... Yeah, it's going through --
Hey, Jake... When am I gonna get to play the Inside?
Gordo plays the inside. You're the Shill.
Gordo plays the inside. You're the Shill.
Yeah, but come on... All I get to do is cry and get insulted.
Yeah, but come on... All I get to do is cry and get insulted.
What are you talking about? You should get a fucking Academy Award for the Shill work you do. We got it down cold, Al. You don't want to jinx it by changing something up, do you?
What are you talking about? You should get a fucking Academy Award for the Shill work you do. We got it down cold, Al. You don't want to jinx it by changing something up, do you?
I'm gonna go get eggrolls. Anyone want eggrolls?
It can erase all those things about you that you wish didn't exist.
It's Alfonse. I want to settle up. I haven't been ducking you. I told you I'd get it.
And I think it's because of this redhead...
Know who I am, Jake?
Know who I am, Jake?
The Anti-Christ?
The Anti-Christ?
No. I'm not the Anti-Christ. Or the Prince of Darkness. I'm just a guy looking for some answers.
Things are probably going to end badly for you, Jake.
Gee... What makes you say that?
Gee... What makes you say that?
Your life flashing before your eyes?
Your life flashing before your eyes?
Just the last three weeks.
Just the last three weeks.
That's not a bad place to start.
Grifters...
We can't all be model citizens such as yourself.

It's all about the money, isn't it?
It's all about the money, isn't it?
Isn't it always?
I'm not saying anything. Besides, you're one to talk. You're the one who's got me on my knees in a dark alley.
And these cops? What do they get?
Keeping the Fix happy.
You never know when you can use a crooked cop.
You never know when you can use a crooked cop.
Keep going. I want to know how you got Lionel Dolby.
Keep going. I want to know how you got Lionel Dolby.
So you want to know how to play the Big Con.
So you want to know how to play the Big Con.
In this case, you might say I want to know how not to play the Big Con.
So how'd you get caught?
Suits used to say that in any con, sooner or later someone's going to start asking the right questions. Usually, it takes a little longer.
I can see why you liked her.
That was it. We had our crew. Now we needed the Mark.
But there were other factors.
Factors that weren't clear to me until now.
He's just as crooked as the next guy. You'd think he'd have more important things to do with tax payer dollars.
Cue the fucking violins. Come on... It's getting cold.
Nice.
We got our stake. Now we need to find our guy in Gillett's bank.
Thanks. Did you know you shouldn't light three cigarettes with a match?
Back in WWI or WWII, one of the WW's, if you took the time to light three cigarettes with one match, some Nazi would be able to figure out where you were. Then, well... It was the last cigarette you and your two buddies ever had. So three on a match is bad luck.

You're a superstitious fucker.
You're a superstitious fucker.
Luck's a funny thing. Especially the bad.
Luck's a funny thing. Especially the bad.
Like what?
Like what?
Having a gun pointed at you for one. It's not like breaking a mirror bad luck, but it's bad. Three on a match, black cats... Believe it. Believe it all.
She had you tempting fate.
My father used to play the same fucking lotto numbers with these other guys in the pharmacy. The same numbers everyday for sixteen years. One day he gets pissed off, tells them he's out and plays his own numbers. They hit the Lucky Seven for one point two million.
Is that what it was, Jake? Was it love?
You know when the first con was ever played? It was when Adam fell for Eve in the Garden of Eden.
So much for honor among thieves. You would have cut loose your friends, your girl...
I was doing it for them.
I was doing it for them.
BULLSHIT! You were scared, Jake! You lost your nerve! You lost your confidence! You weren't being noble. You weren't trying to save anybody but yourself! Admit it.
BULLSHIT! You were scared, Jake! You lost your nerve! You lost your confidence! You weren't being noble. You weren't trying to save anybody but yourself! Admit it.
It's not true.
It's not true.
Yes it is, Jake! Yes it is! They were right there for you. She was right there for you! Look at her!
We were back on.
After you cut her loose.
After you cut her loose.
She walked.
Alrlght, alrlght. What happened today?
Today? Started off great...
Alright... Turn around. She doesn't get shit, unless I get that money. Where is it?
Probably safe in the hands of the Federal Government.
Oh, Jake. You disappoint me. And you just let Lily here down again. What was it you said about playing the big con?
It's like putting on a play, where everyone knows their part except for the mark.
It's like putting on a play, where everyone knows their part except for the mark.
Like putting on a play... Guess some people forgot their lines.
Like putting on a play... Guess some people forgot their lines.
Guess so.
Guess so.
So why don't you take a deep breath, Jake, and I'll count to ten. One. Two. Three...
Not that I recall. What do you want us to do about it?
Let's see... Let's suppose he gets to Customs and he gets caught. We get our money back, but then we have to deal with a criminal investigation. I don't much like that idea. Then again, let's suppose he actually gets through Customs. Now, that'll be something. We recover the money in cash and let the insurance cover the corporate fraud. We double our money.

So we go to the bar.
So we go to the bar.
I think so. The airport's going to be crawling with police. Traffic will be a nightmare. Go down to the bar. If they pull it off, great. Have someone deal with Ashby.

We'll take care of it.
We'll take care of it.
And how much did you say you wanted for this... What did you call it? A finder's fee?
Ten is standard, sir.
Fine. But only if we recover the cash.
Who's that?
The cash we fleeced off of him was collection money. He was supposed to take that money and give it to the King earlier yesterday like he does every Thursday. 'Cept this time, he figured he could make a little something for himself off us and still get the King's money back before any body says "boo."

What's a King Pin?
Currently, the King Pin is a very large-type pole stuck up our asses.
Mob?
Mob?
Independent. Same shit, just independent. They call him the King Pin because he looks like that guy from the comic book... Big. Fat. Bald.

So what? We hide, right?
So what? We hide, right?
What are you? New? Let me tell you how good this guy is. Last night, Al calls this bookie to settle up. Apparently he's been ducking him for like a month. So the guy asks him where he's got all this money all of a sudden, right? What does Al do? Does he tell him that he cashed in a fucking Bar Mitzvah bond?

You're pissed we didn't get credit?
You're pissed we didn't get credit?
No, that was the only semi-fucking smart thing he said! Except anybody that's ever met Big Al knows that the only thing he's comfortable doing alone is eating. This guys tells this guy, that guy tells some other guy, eventually it works it's way back to someone who works for the King and --
Big Al gets whacked mid-egg foo young. The whole thing took about two and a half hours. That's how good he is.
We sure Big Al threw him to us?
We sure Big Al threw him to us?
Come on...
Whoa. What?
We're going to give him the money back?
Fuck that. We're going too.
Alright, let's all put our dicks back in our pants for a second. Is this the best thing to do?
This might just be me, but that is hands down, the dumbest fucking idea I've ever heard.
People have tried this before, Jake. It's never worked. Teddy Fraiser and his crew went on vacation in Chicago for it. Last year, Mumps got pinched in L.A.
The red hair... It's bad luck.
It's not like she's a real redhead, Jake...
Poor bastard never knew what hit him. Jesus, I almost felt sorry for the guy.
I gotta work off some of this adrenaline. I got a line on this Pawn Shop guy over in Brooklyn. Anybody want in?
Masters of our own destiny.
So far, masters of our own demise. What bank are you with?
Jake...
It's alright. Grant's one of the good guys.
I'm going home
Let's go, Jake?
Moonan. Here. Shit...
So what? We just stay clear of him.
That's it? What are you talking about? We can still do this!
Jake, I mean, come on --
Shit.
I told you, use less powder.
I told you, use less powder.
But you won't get that splatter effect.
What? I can feel you looking at me.
That's a lot of cash. He came up with it pretty quick.
That's a lot of cash. He came up with it pretty quick.
Probably some investment banker or convertible-bonds-broker-dickhead. Did you see how fast he ran out of here? It's done. He's not coming back.
Probably some investment banker or convertible-bonds-broker-dickhead. Did you see how fast he ran out of here? It's done. He's not coming back.
I guess. I gotta drop a dime. Did anybody mess up the hoop?
It can buy you a new and better you.
I just don't know if this says, "me". What's the fabric?
Seems Lionel Dolby came down with a sudden case of drowning last night. They just pulled him out of the East River.
Well, this is just fucking great...
Well, this is just fucking great...
It gets worse. Now I know why he was such a good rope. I mean, cash... That much and we never had to put him on the "Send?" Turns out this ducking Moe was an accountant for the King Pin.
You know what we're doing with the money.
And what about Big Al?
And what about Big Al?
Leave him. Someone's going to find him eventually. Then they'll start looking for us, too.
When?
Tonight. Just me.
You gotta be kidding me. Her?
Yes, her. Where's my wallet?
How much we going after?
Two million.
We only owe the King a hundred and fifty.
We get fifty percent. And we get clear of the King.
We meet him with corporate papers, inquiring about a corporate loan for start up capital. The corporate papers are in order, but we need things to happen fast. Our guy fudges numbers in the right places, moves our papers to the top of the pile or to the bottom, depending upon what we need.
How's that? He works for Gillette.
How's that? He works for Gillette.
We pay better.
Yeah... Whatever, Jake.
No, not "whatever." You're either in or you're out.
You laugh now, but wait until you need a clean place to powder. This is New York city, Sister. Public sanitation does not run very high on the city hall agenda. You know what you can get off a toilet or doorknob? Let's do the list... Hepatitis, influenza, the flesh eating disease --
Here's what's going to happen. Gordo, we need to find a guy in Gillette's bank. Miles, we need papers, corporate, insurance...
She up for this?
She's up for it.
She got one leg out from under him. Now we had to lean.
So then Miles walks straight into the Creative Director's office and says "The code's fine, the program's for shit" and throws down like a thousand pages of code on the guy's desk!
Uh... No thanks. I'm not going all the way to Brooklyn for a hundred dollar pay-off.
You sure?
We're going to make it back, Grant. Three or four times over.
And all you need to do for your ten percent is put some paperwork through and push a button tomorrow.
You'll be there?
Eight A.M. flight.
Eight A.M. flight.
Calls?
Calls?
We'll use the Euc.
Jake --
What do I always tell you guys? Don't spend it all. Sooner or later we're going to run into some bad luck. Save some. Put it away, so when shit like this happens, you're not desperate. That's it. The gig's up.
So that's it...
That's it.
Then he had to bang it out across the street at the Bank of the Caymens...
I'd like this cashed, please.
You ever use the bathroom in Kennedy?
What? No. Use the bathroom on the plane!
Grifter huh? Where have you been on the grift? Couldn't been here long 'cause I would have heard of you, Skippy.
Jake. You can call me Jake. Here and there.
Jake. You can call me Jake. Here and there.
Here and there, Scooter? Here and there like Boston, Chicago, Houston? The bay area? Some action in London, 'til it turned nickel and dime. Or how about that little stint down in Miami? Heard you actually got into some trouble with the Feds down there. You guy's pretty good?

I have a good crew.
I have a good crew.
Minus one.
Minus one.
You know, back in the day, grafting was considered a gentleman's racket. Good suits, good food... The Underworld of the Underworld. A grifter had to survive on his wits, his instincts... I like that. I like the idea of that. These days, things being what they are, guys like me gotta stay low. It's all take, take, take. You can't just be fucking witty

I apologize for the inconvenience.
Honest mistake. Just give me the money back and all will be forgiven.
I can't do that.
I can't do that.
Why not?
Why not?
Let me rephrase -- I won't do that.

I'll get the money back, plus interest. I go on the grift for you. You get a cat, I get a cut. And we get square.

Fucking grifters! I love it! You got balls, I'll give you that much.
Fucking grifters! I love it! You got balls, I'll give you that much.
No. Just confidence.
I' ll be honest with you, Kid. A grifter comes in here with a fifteen hundred dollar D-K-fucking-N-Y suit, cooler than an Eskimo in winter and tells me he wants to grift for me? First thing I have to ask myself is, is he playing for me or is he just plain playing me? You tried it once.
We got caught. So you know it won't happen again.
Why?
You ask a lot of questions. Come on. Let me see 'em.
How much?
I think two million.
I think two million.
What do you need from me? Permission? Go! If you can fleece him for two million, then do it, Kid.
What do you need from me? Permission? Go! If you can fleece him for two million, then do it, Kid.
I need you to stake me.
I need you to stake me.
Stake you?
Stake you?
I need you to stake me. I can't do it without it. It's just a couple hundred grand. Taken out of our cut when we're done.
That's more than you already owe me. What happens if you fuck this up?
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
Hey Skippy? Do I have the word "chump" tattooed on my forehead?
Listen, Scooter --
No, you listen. We're partners now and even though I'm running the show for you, I'm still running the show. That means I get a little respect. So I don't want to hear anymore of this Scooter, Buddy, Junior, Skippy, Tiger, bullshit. It's Jake. And I gotta tell you, for a guy who spends all his time in a gym, you could be in
Excuse me?
I said take off your fucking shirt.
Look at you, you skinny prick.
You're not going to bust out baby oil and start rubbing me down or anything, are you?
Come here. Feel this.
No thanks. I'm good.
No thanks. I'm good.
Come here!
Come on. Harder.
I think I just broke my hand.
I think I just broke my hand.
Harder. Remember, I killed your buddy.
What are you talking about? Ten's standard.
Yeah Well, Sobo's kid needs braces.
Don't get me wrong, Jake. I like you boys. You guys are the steadiest business in town. But what can I say? Twenty percent's still better than what we give to any of the other criminals.
All the shit we pulled with you and you're trying to shake us down? You guys got sack.
All the shit we pulled with you and you're trying to shake us down? You guys got sack.
Was that a threat? Did I hear a threat? Last I remember, we were talking economics, then this...? What happens next time if we gotta stop and help a little old lady cross the street? Well, shit... Then we gotta pass the call to someone else.
That tip not work-out for you fellas?
Tip was fine, Jake. We were a little more curious about the Fed.
Tip was fine, Jake. We were a little more curious about the Fed.
Hey, listen... If you guys don't pay your taxes, that's your business.
Special Agent Gunther Moonan. Ring a bell?
Gunther? I think I'd remember a Gunther.
Gunther? I think I'd remember a Gunther.
Ring it for him, Sobo.
Oh yeah. Moonan. I remember now. Thanks.
Well he's in town and he sure as shit remembers you. What are we going to do about this Jake? We can't afford to have a Fed onto us.
Well he's in town and he sure as shit remembers you. What are we going to do about this Jake? We can't afford to have a Fed onto us.
Wouldn't dream of it.
I don't know what you're into with the King Pin, but whatever it is we get a piece, understand? We get a big piece. If we find out you're keeping us out, I may suddenly develop a conscious and give you up to Moonan myself. Say something stupid if we got a deal, Jake.
Something stupid.
Something stupid.
Good boy.
Kennedy. International terminal. Gordo with a black suitcase. You got Moonan under control?
Don't worry about Moonan. We got him covered. When...? It was him. There's a shipment coming through tonight. Kennedy.
Sorry, I --
Jake. Jake Pearson. I go to lawschool with your daughter. Carolyn. We met once or twice.
Of course. Jake. Nice to see you.
Well, it certainly is a coincidence. Here of all places! How is Mrs. Lewis?
Well, it certainly is a coincidence. Here of all places! How is Mrs. Lewis?
Great. Thank you.
What brings you down from Boston, Jake? Taking advantage of the long weekend?
My wife and I are just taking a little vacation.
Attractive girl.
Thank you. Actually, it's our first anniversary this weekend. She thinks I'm here to pick up something for my mother, but it's actually a gift for her. Think I've fooled her?
Thank you. Actually, it's our first anniversary this weekend. She thinks I'm here to pick up something for my mother, but it's actually a gift for her. Think I've fooled her?
Take it from me, you never do. But congratulations. Nice to be married, isn't it?
Take it from me, you never do. But congratulations. Nice to be married, isn't it?
Very much so.
Thank you, sir. You know, I hope this isn't too much of an inconvenience, but if Carolyn is coming down for the weekend, perhaps I could give you something for her? It's a check. We split the cost on a few books and I haven't had the chance to pay her back yet. Could you..?
Sure.
I lost my head. I'm... Sorry. I don't know what happened.
Y-y-you fucking shot him! That's what happened!
Y-y-you fucking shot him! That's what happened!
I had to! That motherfucker was about to welch! You saw what he was doing, right? You heard him!
I can't be here! You understand? I can't --
Listen to me! It went to shit. It happens sometimes.
Oh Jesus!
LISTEN to me! We don't have much time. We can still get through this but you have to keep your head and trust me!
What -- What do we do?
Help me.
What about... The money?
What about this situation makes you think I can answer that question right now?
What is this? You guys cops or something?
We're not cops.
That's not --
You interested in a little work?
Sorry about your wallet, but if you think I'm going to suck dick over thirty seven dollars, a maxed out Visa and a bad fake I.D., you're fucking crazy. Jake.
Take a deep breath and count to ten. It's not that kind of work. You're Lily, right?
Take a deep breath and count to ten. It's not that kind of work. You're Lily, right?
Says who?
Says who?
You're working Daffy's block. He was going to break your kneecaps. Pick- pockets can be so bitchy sometimes. I told him you were with us, so that's two you owe me.
We have work. It pays a lot. Unless you figure on getting rich lifting wallets while old guys feel you up.
Oooh. Sassy. What do you care who feels me up, Jake? Unless it kinda gotcha going. Did it, Jake? Getcha going?
Alright! Hold up. You win. You got the job.
Gee thanks. Now I don't have to find that bridge to jump off.
We had to see what your deal was. I'm just a little superstitious.
Here's my deal -- Don't waste my time. What do you want me for anyway? You don't even know me.
Here's my deal -- Don't waste my time. What do you want me for anyway? You don't even know me.
I just have a good feeling about you. Haven't you ever had someone say they had a good feeling about you before?
No. What's my cut?
You get an equal cut.
You get an equal cut.
What do I have to do?
What do I have to do?
Just play a part. A little acting.
What about Customs?
I'll worry about Customs.
I'll worry about Customs.
Hey, I'm not just along for the ride, so I don't want to hear any bullshit later about a smaller cut.
Hey, I'm not just along for the ride, so I don't want to hear any bullshit later about a smaller cut.
Take a deep breath. You sound like you just broke up with your boyfriend or something.
Mr. King, I think --
Hey, I got it! Take some mental notes. You just might learn something here.
What the hell's his problem?
Don't worry about it.
Don't worry about it.
It's just that I left my asshole decoder ring at home, so how do I know not to worry?
You need to get a haircut.
What?
What?
And some new clothes.
And some new clothes.
Why?
Why?
We're going to rope this banker tomorrow and you gotta at least look classy, if not be classy. You gotta do this thing and I don't even know if you can.

I don't trust anyone.

Then show me how.
Uh... Everything okay?
Honey, this is Mr. Lewis. Carolyn Lewis's father. Mr. Lewis, this is my wife, Lily.
He's gone.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
I gotta go get a haircut.
I gotta go get a haircut.
Uh-huh.
You just put a mother of a jinx on us.
Lighten up.
Lighten up.
But the fucking Grand Poo-Bah of all jinxes? A bird in your house...
You told me to change my hair!
What about this? Do you have any idea what this means? You've killed us. We're dead!
What about this? Do you have any idea what this means? You've killed us. We're dead!
Did I miss something?
We're getting down to the wire. Apparently another company has a similar product in R&D right now. If they beat us to it...
Off the record, I'm this close to cutting someone in on the action if it'd help.
Look at you... You want to go.
For what? A couple hundred bucks?
For what? A couple hundred bucks?
I think you'd do it for free. You're almost drooling. You like the rush.

You have really soft hands. Like a baby's.
Don't ruin this for me.
How do you deal with --
WHAT?
WHAT?
I SAID, HOW DO -- Deal with that?
Who says you have to know the King to be in a hole? I actually did have a real job once. When I was in high school, I worked as a candy striper.
Sounds respectable.
Sounds respectable.
Not the way I did it. I was loaded half the time. I don't know how you could change bedpans sober. I used to hang out with this guy, Glenn. He was an x-ray technician or something.
Not the way I did it. I was loaded half the time. I don't know how you could change bedpans sober. I used to hang out with this guy, Glenn. He was an x-ray technician or something.
You want to talk about an old boyfriend right now?
He wasn't my boyfriend. I had a boyfriend at the time... What was his name? Anyway, Glenn was like thirty. I was only fifteen. But he was a nice guy. Real sweet. Liked to talk. We used to get loaded on pills from the nurses station and then listen to Morrisey or some stupid shit like that.
Yeah, the sensitive guy-thing never worked for me.
Yeah, the sensitive guy-thing never worked for me.
We were friends. I trusted him. I should have known it was weird. But, then again I was weird.
We were friends. I trusted him. I should have known it was weird. But, then again I was weird.
You guys got busted. This is a great neck.
No, we never got busted. We were done with a shift one night, both a couple of Percocets down and I was telling Glenn about my boyfriend, about how we were thinking about doing it, you know? I was thinking about letting him be my first because I loved him. What the hell was his name?
Glenn talked you out of it.
Glenn talked you out of it.
Sort of. I was telling him about this great love of my life who's name I don't remember, and I could see... He was getting pissed. I thought it was just because he was worried about me, but... He told me that I was stupid because my boyfriend didn't really love me.
He was looking out for you.
Then he grabbed me and threw me down on the floor, that really cold linoleum tiled hospital floor and started ripping my uniform off. He said he was going to "fuck some sense into me."
Shit, what was that guy's name? I really liked him.
Lily... Jesus Christ...
Lily... Jesus Christ...
After Glenn was finished, he gave me a couple of valiums and I went home. The next day, I finished my shift and met him around back, like we always did. I stuck a number eight scalpel into his chest. Three or four times.
Did, uh... Did you kill him?
I don't know. I packed up my shit and ran away. To this... So unlike you, I guess I do have something to prove, in a repressed anger sort of way.
No. You trusted him... You were just getting square.
You know why I told you that, Jake? Because I trust you too.
Jesus... Take it easy.
No, I'm not going to take it easy. You can't stay clear of this guy. He will be on this until the end of time.
You are such a raving pussy sometimes.
Hey, we fucked once, honey. That hardly makes you a good judge of character. And don't think I didn't know you were working some angle with that either.

Everyone's working an angle, right?
Everyone's working an angle, right?
There are three people I trust -- him, him and a guy who got killed. I don't know who you are! You're like some stray dog that wandered into the house. So I'm telling you to cut loose of this. No one's looking for you, Not the King, not Moonan and not Gillette. Just go wherever it is you would go. It's over.
What about...
What about what?
What about what?
What about the money?
So there it is. You got that big itch you need to scratch. It's all about the fucking money. What do you want, an apology?
No, I want my cut!
No, I want my cut!
I'm going to say this one last time for you, so take a deep breath and count to ten. There is no cut.
Sorry. I didn't know...
Your friend, Big Al? It should have been you.
You got my cell. Leave a message.
It's me. It's Jake. Listen... It's happening. Gordo's landing right now. Meet me at the Euclid... For your cut, I mean. It's... I want you to have it.
What do you get, Lily? Finder's Fee? Because it is all about the money, right?
You sold me out. You should have trusted me like I trusted you. You fucked up. You fucked up HUGE.
You tell them the "Tale".
What do you want? An apology?
What do you want? An apology?
No, I want my cut!
Tick-tock...
If you wanna help, then help. If not, shut up.
If you wanna help, then help. If not, shut up.
Your mess.
Your mess.
Then shut up.
Then shut up.
My place.
Stop waving that thing around.
You sure we're clear?
Yeah.
You better get over to Al's. Now.
I was supposed to meet him for breakfast. He likes that new IHOP they just opened, you know... He likes to order that thing. The Rutti- Tutti-Fresh and Fruity thing they got.
Miles...
Miles...
Sorry. I'm just... Look what they did to him. Right in the middle of his egg-foo-young.
It's bad luck.
Just an idea, but let's just fucking split. We'll meet up anywhere. Akron or Austin or Atlanta. Anywhere...
Just an idea, but let's just fucking split. We'll meet up anywhere. Akron or Austin or Atlanta. Anywhere...
He'll find us. We go talk to him.
Do we want insurance? I'm just asking...
Just mail it to the hospital. Mr. King, please. It's regarding an accounting problem. Yes... Correct... I know where it is. That will be fine. Thank you.
Meet me at my place later.
How do you know the King's going to let you walk?
How do you know the King's going to let you walk?
I'm getting a ride.
You better hurry. The police will be here any second. I don't really understand my motivation with this. Why am I washing glasses?
Now you're an accomplice in a homicide. Everything you thought you were in control of just flew out the window or is dripping down your leg.
We're working for the King.
Wait a second... Who's the mope?
No. Big con. One rag. One rag and we get out from under all this. But we need another Shill.
What do we need another Shill for?
What do we need another Shill for?
Breasts.
Why?
Because that's who the King Pin wants us to fleece. And Gillette's perfect...
Uh...
What?
What?
I'm just thinking out loud here, but... Two million in a briefcase?
I'm just thinking out loud here, but... Two million in a briefcase?
Good point.
It never worked before because A, they didn't flush the bank enough; B, their corporate papers were for shit; C, they didn't have someone on the inside with Customs.
Yeah, or D, it's a dumb fucking idea...
Yeah, or D, it's a dumb fucking idea...
Then what do you want to do, Miles? Run?
Then what do you want to do, Miles? Run?
We never had a problem with that before.
We never had a problem with that before.
Yeah, well we never had this kind of problem before.
Yeah, well we never had this kind of problem before.
What are you talking about? Yes we have. And we would have been beautiful about it. We would've had a bucket of chicken delivered to the King with a nice kiss my ass card attached to it. Then we woulda moved on 'til the next local putz caught on.

We're getting a little old for running.
We're getting a little old for running.
Yeah, well we're still a little young for Albany State Prison. Are you pissed about Al? I'm pissed too, but I'm not like "twenty-five to life" pissed.
Yeah, well we're still a little young for Albany State Prison. Are you pissed about Al? I'm pissed too, but I'm not like "twenty-five to life" pissed.
I'm getting clear of this. If you're not going to do it for the fucking principle, do it for the money. Gordo?
Is it all fugasi?
No, the corporate papers have to be legit. But you gotta score an I.D. A clean one. Talk to Suits. I gotta get us a Banker.
What you're looking for in a mark is someone who's weakness you can exploit.
Michelle Strigo. Loan officer.
Him.
You sure?
But if you wanna talk about bad luck...
Where the hell is she?
So this is our boss, right? He chases me and Miles out of his office and he's yelling and screaming, "You're fired! Your whole team's fired!" He starts looking for Lily, Lupus, Gordo --
But the best part was that he couldn't find Gordo! He was in the bathroom. So he finally goes in there, kicks in a stall door and starts yelling! And there's Gordo, pants at the ankles, holding a PC World Magazine!
What do we do? We change the scam?
There is no scam! I've got a fucking sign on my back! I can't leave town now and come back with a suitcase full of money. You get it? It's over. We walk.
No, no, no! Not this time. I am doing this for your own good! You guys have got to learn when to stop. You with the Armani! You with the hookers!
Escorts!
Escorts!
Do you even remember Al? Do you remember what he looked like sitting there?
Feeling lucky today, Miles. Found a penny -- Heads up. There was an empty cab right outside my building. We hit every green light.
And we got rid of the red head.
And we got rid of the red head.
Jake? Customs?
Excuse me? I believe you're holding something far me under Pearson.
Do you have a ticket?
Do you have a ticket?
You know, this is kind of embarrassing, but my wallet was stolen yesterday and I'm afraid the ticket was in it. But the name's Pearson.
I'm sorry. Nothing under Pearson.
You're sure? This is... Just a complete disaster.
You're sure? This is... Just a complete disaster.
What was it?
A ring for my wife. A lot like that one. In fact, it was that one.
That's no problem. We have those in stock.
That's no problem. We have those in stock.
Thank you. Sorry, I'm just a little anxious to give it to her. You take out of state checks?
Thank you. Sorry, I'm just a little anxious to give it to her. You take out of state checks?
With identification.
I understand that, but I had my wallet stolen last night. Is there any way..?
I'm sorry.
I know it's policy, but... The thing is... It's our first anniversary and we're only in town for the weekend. It's a very, very special night for my wife and I. This ring is my gift to her and I think she's going to really love it. I can give you phone numbers to call for people who'll vouch. I can send you I.D.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
This is embarrassing.
When this is all over, you're going to tell me who the King put on Al.
You going to have the time?
You going to have the time?
I'll find the time.
King ain't gonna like this.
Don't worry, I'll settle up with your boss. We haven't skipped town yet.
Don't worry, I'll settle up with your boss. We haven't skipped town yet.
What I'm saying is, is that the King ain't gonna care. See he had a real thing with getting this Gillette guy, If you ask me I think he's jealous.

Of what? They're both crooks.
Of what? They're both crooks.
Exactly. 'Cept this Gillette guy. He gets to walk around in three piece suits, hob knob with the Mayor, own a bank, that kinda shit. Meanwhile, the King sits holed up in the steam, afraid to even take a leak without me or Harlin watching the door.

My fucking heart bleeds.
My fucking heart bleeds.
Your buddy. That fat guy. The King couldn't wait to have that guy whacked. He didn't even know who the guy was, but he was so pissed off at him, he gets him drilled. It ain't personal. It's business.

Point, Lupus. Give us a point.
Point, Lupus. Give us a point.
Point is, you don't go through with this, he's going to go after you next. And he don't even like you, Jake.
What'd he say?
Oh, you know... Don't fuck this up. I'll kill you. I'll kill your family. I'll shoot your dog... All the usual. Then he said good luck.
So that's it, huh? You get the cops to give you a safe ride.
Let me ask you something... You really think I'm going to come this close, this fucking close and let my guard down? I'll get square with your boss. I'll get square with whoever did Al. I'll get square with everybody. Then I'm going going to cash in my chips and be on my way to a new and better me far away from here.

You're a weasel.
He's wheeling around two million dollars in cash and he wants to stop to use the bathroom. You believe this?
Maybe he's got it right. Maybe we're all just looking for a safe place to shit.
Maybe he's got it right. Maybe we're all just looking for a safe place to shit.
That was fucking deep.
What's up with you? Bladder infection?
Keep it up.
You really like that bitch don't you? I gotta tell you, I was pretty convinced that the whole thing before was blowing her off for her cut. You know how it is, get her to do some shit for you, throw her a bang to keep her happy. But, if you're into her... That's cool.
That's what I like about you, Lupus. You're a free thinker. Don't let the King tell you different.
Egg Foo Young. Stand up.
What?
What?
Stand up.
Stand up.
No offense, but I've seen you fight. You gotta be kidding m-
What happened?
Eee Oott Auught!
Eee Oott Auught!
Sorry. What?
Sorry. What?
HE GOT CAUGHT! Your boss tried to pull a switch and he got us all fucking pinched!
And like in a game of chess, you've played every possible move in your head...
You were right. He's trying to fuck you. You want it, you gotta get it at the airport...
Aces, Suits.
Not easy pickin's. Papers like these speak to larger issues. Sorry about Alfonse. You into something big?
Not easy pickin's. Papers like these speak to larger issues. Sorry about Alfonse. You into something big?
Pretty much.
Pretty much.
In over your head?

Pretty much.
Can I speak to you in confidence?
Huh? Oh. She's alright.
Try and keep up... You ask for the Advantage Goods, then you guys come in looking to be Bean Traps. So I gotta think you're either working the mace or playing the Jug Mob.
A little bit of both.
Hey, I been on the ramp all my life, so I got no problem with the way you help yourself, Jake.
I saw you go up from the Knecker, working that Grind, learning the Barnard's Law and I thought, "the kid's a prodigy." But I know that if you're using these goods... So then I figure, what's worth that? You're either looking for a little history or a retirement fund. Who's the Mark?

Can't say.

Then who's the Banker?
Then who's the Banker?
The King.
The King? Jake, you play the heavy rackets like that... They put the lug on for nothing at all.
I can handle it.
I can handle it.
I don't doubt your talent. You looking for that place in the hall of fame?
I don't doubt your talent. You looking for that place in the hall of fame?
It's not history.
It's not history.
So what do you want?
So what do you want?
I want to get out from under all this for good. And I want to fuck them all doing it.
I want to get out from under all this for good. And I want to fuck them all doing it.
Then I gotta say, in my opinion, you can't get what you want.
Still time.
Can't do it Suits. I can't lay down for this one.
Can't do it Suits. I can't lay down for this one.
Okay. Here's the thing... You fall flat, you might not get anything short of stiffed. Then it's Blue River Land for everybody. Papers like these are dangerous because papers tend to multiply, then they start to take shape. Usually it's the shape of an arrow. I hate to do it, but after this, I gotta give you the blowoff. We Jake, Jake?
Ten percent.
You guys got sack, I'll give you that much.
You guys got sack, I'll give you that much.
Confidence. It's just confidence.
Do you have any idea what those monks charge for that medieval torture?
We got a good thing going here. You want to blow it over an overbite?
The King, huh? Nice going.
I try.
Just a tip.
What are we gonna do with this stuff anyway? Heroin? What the hell do you do with heroin?
What?
Consider him part of your crew. Consider him a part of me.
Coupla things. They got this Fed looking around and the girl just split.
A Fed? Is he close?
A Fed? Is he close?
I don't think so. Their Fix gave us the heads up and Jake's got a plan that'll probably keep him off.
Speak.
He's landing. He's got a suitcase on wheels.
He's landing. He's got a suitcase on wheels.
So do half the other people in this place. How do I know which one?
So do half the other people in this place. How do I know which one?
I got it figured out... He's got this thing with bathrooms. If he makes it through Customs, he'll be heading for the john.

Good. Good. Do not let Vig out of your sight.
Special Agent?
You are Officer Richard Rottovich. And this would be Officer Walter Sobozinski. I'm looking for Jake Vig.
Preliminary forensics suggests he was sitting there, bloated and purple in his egg foo young for at least seventy two hours. Alfonse was not a small man and there was a lot of food ordered, so you can imagine the smell. Bad for the neighbors, good for me because in all the time I've been looking for Jake, this is only the second time
Look Special Agent Moonan... We don't know what you're talking about.
If you Feds are so hot for him, why don't we just bring him in right now?
I want him for something big and to do that, we have to catch him in the act.
Like we told you before, we think he's into something with the King Pin --
Look, I'm not a confrontational person by nature.
Did he buy it?
I think so. What'd he ever do to you anyway?
I think so. What'd he ever do to you anyway?
Let's just say he burned me once.
You guys awake?
We're here.
Who?
I've been looking for this Jake Vig for some time now. Problem is, the guy's the invisible man. A spook, a spectre, a ghost. Then, like a gift, Jake's good buddy and member of his crew, Alfonse Moorely, is found the other day with a hole in his head.
Do you want to know the first time I had a line on Vig? He sent me a birthday card. Belated, but it's the thought, right? Oh, this prick's got a sense of humor. But, then again you guys probably know him better than I do. In fact, I've only met the guy once. But now, now I have you. The next best thing.
What do you want?
What do you want?
You help me catch him. Whatever he's into next, I want you to be into. And what you're into, I'm into. If it all goes well, those two guys from IAD will never have to hear this tape. I'll clear you guys of anything you've ever done with Vig under the guise of some cross- departmental investigation. This prick's been on the wish list

What do you get out of it?
Peace of mind.
Peace of mind.
That's it?
That's it?
Not everyone's on the take, Walter.
This guy must have been a real pain in your dick.
Literally. It's not a bad deal, gentleman. I get peace of mind. You get Detective Sheilds. But this is the best part, Walter... Walter, your daughter will get to keep her braces and have that winning smile. Capice?
Good... I gotta go. So, what do you have for me?
Whaddya mean? We got dick.
Whaddya mean? We got dick.
You guy's are not working with me here. I just got off the phone with my boss. After he got done ripping me a new Lincoln Tunnel size asshole, he let me know exactly how little I'm welcome back if we come up short. And now here you guys are, WASTING MY FUCKING TIME!
He's headed towards the eastern most exit. Do not, under any circumstances approach. I want to follow this all the way down to Vig.
Roger that.
You sell it.
To who?
To who?
Don't be an idiot. How hard do you think it is to sell one drug dealer's drugs to another drug dealer? If Vig's right, we might be looking at a hundred, maybe a hundred fifty grand...
Don't be an idiot. How hard do you think it is to sell one drug dealer's drugs to another drug dealer? If Vig's right, we might be looking at a hundred, maybe a hundred fifty grand...
You think this is a good idea? We never did this kinda shit before.
You think this is a good idea? We never did this kinda shit before.
What's he going to do? File a missing drugs report? If it works out, this guy might be good for a few more turns.
Hope so. Those fucking orthodontist bills are killing me. One fifty every time they tighten those bitches up. One fifty! It's not even covered.
It's cosmetic. They don't cover cosmetic. Last year I had a tooth capped. The dentist tells me I'm not covered for caps. It's cosmetic.
Bullshit it's cosmetic! My fucking tooth was cracked in half. I made the son of a bitch write it in as a cavity. The department's dental is for shit.
Whoa, whoa... There he is.
You trust this Moonan guy?
I don't trust anybody. You see how bad this guy wants Vig? It's like a sickness. I say we collar Vig ourselves. We got Vig, then we got leverage. And we trade; Vig for that tape. I want to see it right in front of my face.

Ouch.
Sorry.
You fucking little shit! You shopped me.
What are you talking about?
Reynolds got a doctor in. They forced me to take a dope test. It was positive. As you knew.
I don't know anything about it.
Your boyfriend fucked me, smoked my dope, then shopped me. What do you think of that? I can't get a job now. You bastard. You're no different from Matt. A pair of vicious little shits, that's what you are.
Look Bella, I don't know anything about this. You should talk to Matt.
Look Bella, I don't know anything about this. You should talk to Matt.

It's not that.

I've set this up for you. Call the Golden Lion and ask for Mr Reynolds, he's the Manager. I don't know him personally, but I've spoken to his boss. Don't say no, Jacko. Give yourself a break.
For Christ's sake, Jacko, don't look a gift horse in the mouth. Have you written that name down? Reynolds, at the Golden Lion.
All right, dad. Yes, I'll call him.
So how are you doing, dad?

What the fuck are you talking about?
That Greek guy who won at the end. You paid him out in 25s not 20s.

I don't cheat, Jack. You've got it wrong.

I'm not going to report it.
What are you, a cop?
If I see you do it again, I'll report it.
If I see you do it again, I'll report it.
I don't get you. Even if it was true, which it isn't, what the fuck difference would it make to you?
I don't get you. Even if it was true, which it isn't, what the fuck difference would it make to you?
Because if a supervisor knew I'd seen you and I hadn't reported it, I'd lose my job as well. And I can't afford that.

So it's Mr Clean. Wise up, Jack, this whole business is bent. The casino is nothing but legal theft. And that's OK. It's the system. Half the punters who come in are using stolen money, drug money, they haven't earned it. We earn our money. I'm on your side, Jack. I don't need an enemy.

You're talking about complicity.

I don't know what that means. I'm talking about not rocking the boat.
Who are these guys?
Mostly people in the casino business. A few drug dealers.

Hey Jack, join us.
No thanks.
No thanks.
Don't worry, I won't report you!
Don't worry, I won't report you!
I don't gamble.
I'm off. I need to sleep.
Loosen up, Jack. If you don't, this job'll get to you. The pressure's too much, believe me, it'll break you.

I can't give you a lift back tonight.
Don't worry.
Rough day?
Rough life, Jack.
What happened to Bella?
I'll tell you later.
What? You know what happened to me, don't you? That bitch Bella shopped me. I'd like to beat the shit out of her.
I'd like to buy you a drink.
I'd like to buy you a drink.
Cheers. Happy New Year. I really like you, Jacko, you're so fucking straight. Hey, you haven't changed your clothes!
I'm sorry, sir, that's a late bet.
What are you talking about? It's 11, I've won. With this lady.

Wait a minute. You got yourself barred.

David Reynolds, I'm the Manager here. Sit down, John.
Jack.
You've been recommended by the management here. They know your father. He has a bit of a reputation, hasn't he?
Has he?
Has he?
In any case, I understand you've had some previous experience... in South Africa. You'll find the rules a little different here. Before we start, you haven't got a police record, have you?

Good call.
You want me to check?
I said good call.
Let me just run through a few things. As a dealer you never gamble, not anywhere. We'll need your picture.
What for?
What for?
For the database. It can be accessed by every casino in the country. We have the same system for punters.

How?
How?
First offence: verbal warning. Second offence: written warning. That one's filed and sometimes copied to the Gaming Board. My discretion. Third offence: you're sacked on the spot. You'd never work in a casino in this country again. There's another rule: you're forbidden to talk to or recognise a punter outside the casino.

Yes.
Yes.
She's not in the gaming business is she?

I just want the job.
Jack, you're not the usual type we get here.
Why don't you take a break, Jack.
All right, Mr Reynolds.
Mr Tchai always likes to play at that table, and only with Bella.
Does he win?
Does he win?
He's a good customer.
He's paying out in stacks of 25.
I can see.
Thanks for the information.
A pleasure. Pity about Bella.

She was a real asset. But what could I do?
How do you feel, Jack?
Bruised.
Bruised.
Take your time. Two weeks. Three if you need it. We'll pay you sick leave. I don't want to lose you. You're a good man. Here...
I have a reduced drive reading of seven thousand.
Right, that checks out here.
Ninety seven million, minus eight, corrected to mass critical.
I read that with a quantum increase of seven.

Remember when the artificial gravity, went out in the toilet?
There she is. Definite 99%-plus probability that the planet is going to deviate from its normal orbit in another twelve thousand rotations. It'll spiral in toward its sun, and --
Eventual supernova.
I can tell, the damn thing just doesn't understand.
Look, bomb...
What's he doin'?
I think he's talking to it.

We're gonna die, Boiler. We're gonna die.
It didn't go off.
Oh, God...
Oh, God...
It didn't go off.
It didn't go off.
Boiler, we're alive. My heart.
We've got to disarm the bomb.
Doolittle, are you there?
What was that, I didn't hear...
It's Talby. He's drifting away from the ship without his jetpack.
What the hell?
Yoo hoo, bomb...
Pinback, I have a computer reading of nine five seven seven.
Time to start talking.
Well... now what? What do, you have for us now. Boiler?
Not much. Nothing at all in this sector.

All right, then...
All right, then...
So don't give me any of that sentient life crap. Find me something I can blow up.
Hey, Doolittle, here's one. An unstable planet. 85% probability of an unstable planet in the Veil Nebula that will probably go off its orbit and hit a star.
Sounds good. Chart a course for the Veil Nebula.
Sounds good. Chart a course for the Veil Nebula.
Pinback, throw me the chart log.
Why doesn't Talby ever eat down here with the rest of us?
He just likes it up in the dome, that's all.
Quantum is up thirty-five.
I read the same here.
Rechannel all safety relays --
-- open quantum latches --
Talby, Talby, can you read me?
Can you beat that? I always knew Talby was weird.

Talby, can you read me?
Well, bomb, we have about sixty seconds to drop. Just wondering if everything is all right. Have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding?
Energy shielding positive function.

But you can't explode in the bomb bay. It's foolish. You'll kill us all. There's no reason for it.
I am programmed to detonate in nine minutes. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.

And I saw that I was alone.
This is Lieutenant Doolittle calling Bomb #20. I repeat previous order, you are to disarm yourself and return immediately to the bomb bay. Do you understand?
I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes thirty seconds. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.

Fine. Think about this one, then: how do you know you exist?
Well of course I exist.
But how do you know you exist?

It is intuitively obvious.

That's good. Very good. Now then, how do you know that anything else exists?
That's good. Very good. Now then, how do you know that anything else exists?
My sensory apparatus reveals it to me.
My sensory apparatus reveals it to me.
Right!
Right!
This is fun.
This is fun.
All right now, here's the big question: how do you know that the evidence your sensory apparatus reveals to you is correct?
What I'm getting at is this: the only experience that is directly available to you is your sensory data. And this data is merely a stream of electrical impulses which stimulate your computing center.
In other words, all I really know about the outside universe relayed to me through my electrical connections.
In other words, all I really know about the outside universe relayed to me through my electrical connections.
Exactly.

Why, that would mean... I really don't know what the outside universe is like at all, for certain.

That's it.
That's it.
Intriguing. I wish I had more time to discuss this matter.
Intriguing. I wish I had more time to discuss this matter.
Why don't you have more time?
Why don't you have more time?
Because I must detonate in seventy- five seconds.
Now, bomb, consider this next question, very carefully. What is your one purpose in life?
To explode, of course.
To explode, of course.
And you can only do it once, right?
And you can only do it once, right?
That is correct.
That is correct.
And you wouldn't want to explode on the basis of false data, would you?
And you wouldn't want to explode on the basis of false data, would you?
Of course not.
Of course not.
Well then, you've already admitted that you have no real proof of the existence of the outside universe.
Well then, you've already admitted that you have no real proof of the existence of the outside universe.
Yes, well...
Yes, well...
So you have no absolute proof that Sergeant Pinback ordered you to detonate.

I recall distinctly the detonation order. My memory is good on matters like these.

Yes, of course you remember it, but what you are remembering is merely a series of electrical impulses which you now realize have no necessary connection with outside reality.
Yes, of course you remember it, but what you are remembering is merely a series of electrical impulses which you now realize have no necessary connection with outside reality.
True, but since this is so, I have no proof that you are really telling me all this.
That's all beside the point. The concepts are valid, wherever they originate.
Hmmm...
Hmmm...
So if you detonate in...
So if you detonate in...
...nine seconds...
...nine seconds...
...you may be doing so on the basis of false data.

I have no proof that it was false data.

I said I'm trying to reach Talby. Something's wrong with the damn intercom. I need a last-minute diameter approximation.
I need a GHF reading on the gravity correction.
I'll check it.

Commander Powell would have named it.
Commander Powell is dead.
Come on, Doolittle, give it a name.
Fred.

I'm coming in now. I'm down by the Emergency Air Lock. Too much trouble to come in the Ventral Lock. Would you blow the seal on the emergency hatch so I can come in?
Oh, sure.
Hello, Pinback, are you there?
Yeah, Doolittle. What's up?
Yeah, Doolittle. What's up?
Talby was in the air lock. You blew him out of the ship. I'm going after him. Turn on his helmet radio so I can contact him.
TALBY!
Oh! Ah, yes, Doolittle. What is it?
I need a diameter approximation.
Okay, Doolittle, I'll have it in a minute.
You know, Talby, you really ought to eat with the rest of us. You spend too much time up here.
I like it up here.
I like it up here.
Must get lonely being up here so much.

Phoenix Asteroids? Never heard of 'em.
They are a body of asteroids that make a complete circuit of the universe once every 12.3 trillion years. The Phoenix Asteroids... From what I've heard, Doolittle, they glow... glow with all the colors of the rainbow. Nobody knows why. They just glow as they drift around the universe. Imagine all the sights they've seen in the time they've been travelling -- the birth

Don't worry about it. We'll find out when it goes bad.

Lieutenant Doolittle, this is Talby. Lieutenant?
Yes, Talby, what is it?
Yes, Talby, what is it?
Sorry to interrupt your lunch, sir, but I'm in the Computer Room, and I think I've located the malfunction. The scanner shows it to be some sort of fault in the communications laser, down by the Emergency Air Lock. Can't pinpoint it exactly, but I'm going down there with a starsuit and try to find it.

Well, I'm in the Emergency Air Lock and --
Doolittle! Help me.
Calm down, Talby. I'm coming.
Doolittle, Doolittle, where are you?
Here I am. I think I'm spinning... We're both falling, Talby, in opposite directions, away from each other. My -- my jetpack's gone.

What happened, Doolittle?

Bomb must have gone off inside the ship. Nothing we can do about it now. Hey, it looks like... the skipper. He made it. Commander Powell made it!
Looks like I'm headed for the planet, Talby. Going right toward it.
When you fall, Doolittle, if there's anyone down there on the planet, somebody may see you. They may see you coming down. What a beautiful way to die... as a falling star...
When you fall, Doolittle, if there's anyone down there on the planet, somebody may see you. They may see you coming down. What a beautiful way to die... as a falling star...
Guess you're right.
Oh yeah?
Doolittle... I think it's the Phoenix Asteroids!
Doolittle... I think it's the Phoenix Asteroids!
Phoenix?
It is, Doolittle, it's the Phoenix! They glow with all the colors of the rainbow, just like everybody said.
No kidding?
No kidding?
I'm going into them, I'm going to hit them. Doolittle...
I'm going into them, I'm going to hit them. Doolittle...
Yeah?
Yeah?
Before we get too far away, and our signals start to fade, I just wanted to tell you... you were my favorite. I really liked you, Doolittle.
Before we get too far away, and our signals start to fade, I just wanted to tell you... you were my favorite. I really liked you, Doolittle.
I really liked you too, Talby. Hey, some debris from the ship! It's coming right by me.
Commander Powell, this is Doolittle. Ah, there's something serious come up, sir, and I have to ask you something.
I'm glad you've come to talk with me, Doolittle. It's been so long since anyone has come to talk with me.
I'm glad you've come to talk with me, Doolittle. It's been so long since anyone has come to talk with me.
Commander, sir, we have a big problem. You see, the Veil Nebula bomb, Bomb Number 20, is stuck. It won't drop from the bomb bay. It refuses to listen and plans to detonate in -- -- less than eleven minutes.

Doolittle, you must tell me one thing.
Doolittle, you must tell me one thing.
What's that, sir?
What's that, sir?
Tell me, Doolittle, how are the Dodgers doing?
Tell me, Doolittle, how are the Dodgers doing?
Well, sir, the Dodgers broke up, disbanded over thirteen years ago.

You don't understand, sir, we can't get the bomb to drop.

It didn't work?

That's correct, sir.

Sorry, Doolittle. I've forgotten so much since I've been in here. So much.
Sorry, Doolittle. I've forgotten so much since I've been in here. So much.

Well, what you might try is --
Commander Powell? Commander, hello!
Doolittle, hello?
Doolittle, hello?
Sorry, sir, you faded out there for a minute.

Sorry.
Sorry.
What were you saying, Commander, about the bomb?
What were you saying, Commander, about the bomb?
Ah... it seems to me, Doolittle... Sorry, I've drawn a blank. Hold it. I'll have it again in a minute. I forget so many things in here, so many things. Hold on, just a minute, let me think...
Commander? Are you still there?
Oh, yes, Doolittle, I'm thinking.
Oh, yes, Doolittle, I'm thinking.
We're running out of time, sir.
We're running out of time, sir.
Oh, yes... Well, Doolittle, if you can't get it to drop you'll have to talk to it.

I already have, sir, and Pinback is talking to it now.

Men... men... what happened, men?
Yeah, the skipper always was lucky.
Who are you?
Bruno's girlfriend.
Bruno's girlfriend.
Oh, yeah?
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Yeah.
But see tonight wives and girlfriends aren't invited.
But see tonight wives and girlfriends aren't invited.
No?
No?
No... Cause tonight the girls are here in a more or less professional capacity. All of them work for me, and you don't... Let's go.
Okay, okay. I can explain... You ever have to do something you really don't want to?
How I make my living, what's your point?
How I make my living, what's your point?
This.
Mr. Sonrisa saw you on the cameras. He wants you to come see him.
I'm on a break.
I'm on a break.
Guess again.
No wire.
Now that that's out of the way... You want the woman, here's how it works. You pull fifty large out of your mattress or wherever, and I make a call to bring her in.
Or we can work on your face with a pair of pliers for a couple of hours and you tell us where she is.
Or we could go another way 'cause your boss seems to like my face just the way it is.
Look, that thing about the pliers, I was just doing what the man pays me to do. Ya know? Comin' off hard.
Yeah, sure, I understand.
I never woulda done it. Probably not, anyway. I mean, I actually think you're pretty cool.
Yeah?
You're attractive, you're smart. Stand on your own two feet, know what I mean? And you got a wicked sense of humor. Man, you really zinged the boss a couple times, it was all I could do--
Sooo...whattya think? Maybe after I betray the woman who trusts me and you take her and her daughter out and execute them...we could go on a date. Play a little miniature golf or somethin'.
Man, you got a bad attitude.
I like to keep it professional, that's all.
Fine. So call her. Get her over here.
Actually, that's not gonna be necessary.
Actually, that's not gonna be necessary.
What?
What?
That's not why we're here.
That's not why we're here.
What the hell are you talkin' about? Call her.
Call the skank now or I start redecorating.
You haven't figured this out yet, have you? You walk in here thinking you're gonna cap her then cap me and take the money back to your boss with your tail wagging... But see it's really the other way around. You think I'm the whack, when actually you're the whack.
See what you don't know is you're already in the last two minutes of your life.
You're in the last two seconds, you don't cut the crap.
You can hardly blame him, the way you've been taking care of business...or should I say, not taking care of it.
What're you talkin' about?
What're you talkin' about?
I'm hired to do a piece of work, my mark goes down and stays down. Your's makes it to the hospital where you then gotta go finish the job. Only the cops got the whole thing on video tape.

Security camera got you coming outta the stairwell, weapon in your hand, going to room one-oh-four and greasing the patient. It's embarrassing to the professional community, is what it is.

I'm outta Portland. Sonrisa didn't want local talent.
This is what your life's worth, Bruno.
But the boss knows I always been loyal.

He's got exposure. He sees you starin' at fifteen to life, there's a chance you could roll over, cop a plea, who knows? Man's figured the odds...and he can't take a chance.
Ass like your, I can see why he's worried you'll punk.
What the hell are you doing?
What the hell are you doing?
Who's Camille?
Who's Camille?
None of your business.
None of your business.
This won't hurt. Triple dose of insulin, you'll go into a coma, couple minutes you'll stop breathing and on a busy night, the coroner will probably mistake it for an O.D. Plus, it's way classier than blowin' your brains out.
Some of us are trying to sleep.
You didn't tell me you lived with her.
You didn't tell me you lived with her.

You mean until you showed up?
You mean until you showed up?
You're not still pissed?
'Cause you went out the back door and nailed her girlfriend? Who would take offense to that?
Justine was not an unwilling participant.
Do you know why I went after Justine?
She was there...
She was there...
Trying to have a relationship with you, Max, is like standing in a fog bank. You know you're in the middle of something only you have absolutely no idea where you are.

And when the fog lifted, there's Darren with his head under Justine's skirt.
And when the fog lifted, there's Darren with his head under Justine's skirt.
Could you give us a moment.
Why would I be pissed?
It was a complicated situation which could have been misconstrued, causing you to maybe take offense.
I was crazy about you...am crazy about you. But you keep everyone at arm's length like there's some great big dark something going on that-- I don't know... It's just that the more I tried to get close to you, the more you pulled away.
I'm really glad we're having this conversation. You're right. I was angry at you. But talking about it-- The scales have fallen from my eyes and I see now that it was all my fault. Can you ever forgive me?

No time.

Unless you wanna end up in jail, let me and Kendra handle the cops.
But I'm afraid of--
Don't look down.
Nobody there to sign for it, mon. What's a bruddah s'posed to do, ride around all day with the damn package?
So you just decided to return it to the sender. Or, in this case, the sender's wife.

It's a rule.
You're light a deuce.

I made you coffee. That oughta help you cope with the injustice of the world a little.
Thanks, it's starting to kick in. I feel almost human.
Thanks, it's starting to kick in. I feel almost human.
Yeah, me too.
He's a mistake I made about six months before you did. But don't feel bad. Justine made the same mistake, along with Renee, Jada, Tia, Brooke--
Yech...
What a creep.
And for all his cattin' around, not much of a stick man either.
What's with you? Every week this scumbag puts the squeeze on us and every week you roll out the welcome wagon like he's family.
Just thought maybe he'd like a little coffee with his saliva.

They took my daughter.
They took my daughter.
I know.
I know.
I couldn't get to her. It all happened so fast. Logan had her, and I saw him fall...then Peter told me to run. And then he...and I remember so clearly, thinking it's me they want. If I run, maybe they'll come after me. Maybe they won't think about her... So I ran...
Your daughter's the only leverage they have to keep you quiet.
Can you help me get her back?
Can you help me get her back?
Look, I'd really like to...
If I give myself up in exchange for Sophy, would you make sure she's okay?

Like I said-- This isn't my regular line of work so I'm making it up as I go.
Look, we gotta keep the momentum up here, not give her a chance to think. If she hears her kid's voice...
Hello...
Hello...
Hang on, Lauren. We're conferencing in Sophy.
Goodnight Bears. Goodnight chairs. Goodnight kittens. Goodnight mittens. Goodnight clocks. And goodnight socks. Goodnight little house. And goodnight--

What makes you cry?
If I'm sad, or tired, or sometimes when I'm angry or when somebody's being mean to me.
If I'm sad, or tired, or sometimes when I'm angry or when somebody's being mean to me.

We didn't get a chance to finish our conversation the other night.

They've lost track of me and I plan to keep it that way.

And whether you want to believe it or not, you already fired the first shot. On another matter, Federal Corrections used to keep records on distinguishing marks-- scars, tattoos. I did a search and came up with this.

I got a hit on the car. An oh-five Tahoe, blue, with Wyoming tags... AGT349... It wasn't easy 'cause you were off in one of the numbers.
Sorry, I was seven at the time.
Who's this guy? This isn't who we're looking for...her name was Hannah.
He got the car in a trade for his old pick-up and some food...no bill of sale or nothing. It was right after the pulse so all the DMV records were wiped. So we don't get anything on the seller. Except I actually managed to find this guy, six hours on the phone... Say thank you.

She was a nurse. She must've lived near there, somewhere, near the... ...the clinic. There must be some registry of nurses or medical technicians or whatever for Wyoming.
Only a last name would be nice. Or the nearest town to this...clinic.
What about the other kids? You get anything on them?

Pull the cash.
So, how do you get the woman to come to me?
I told her it's just business to you, that all you want is a reasonable solution to this. You give her daughter back, she agrees to leave the country. I play the guarantor, drive her down to Mexico tonight, and put her on a train to Brazil or wherever.

Not half as pissed as she's gonna be when she finds out why I blew her off... I need your help, Max.
I don't see how you cheating on Natalie involves me.
I know what you're thinking. But the truth is, this other person is not someone I'm in love with. As a matter of fact, after what she just did, she's not even someone I like much. So in a technical sense, I'm not sure you could call me and her cheating...officially.

I'd be in a position to spend some money on you if you'd get in a position and spend some time on me.
What the hell is that?
Gin.
Gin.
Whoa. Some of this hard liquor's a tad too manly for me. I'm a brewski man myself.
Whoa. Some of this hard liquor's a tad too manly for me. I'm a brewski man myself.
Better ease up then, Hawk. Wouldn't want to give you whiskey dick would we?
Better ease up then, Hawk. Wouldn't want to give you whiskey dick would we?
Who's Whiskey Dick?
Well. Obviously no one you have to worry about... Woody.
My name's not Woody, it's Haw-haw...
Well, Amanda, this has been quite a night. So far you've seen me and my dick throw up. What's next? Projectile diarrhea? Man. What a stud, huh?
Believe it or not, you still have a way to go before you start competing with my soon-to-be-ex-husband... the champion of lousy lovemaking. The man who thinks he's the biggest and the best... The man who thinks every secretary, stewardess, and cocktail waitress he fucks should lick his feet for the honor. The man for whom faking it was invented. Christ, if I hadn't
You love him?
I just told you, he's a big, hairy...
I just told you, he's a big, hairy...
No, I mean... you love your son?
No, I mean... you love your son?
More than anything in the world.
More than anything in the world.
And he loves you back, doesn't he?
And he loves you back, doesn't he?
He's a little spoiled, but I know he does.
He's a little spoiled, but I know he does.
Well, shame on him if he doesn't.
Amanda, as ironic as this is gonna sound, I can't take any money for... I'm no Midnight Cowboy, y'know. It would only cheapen the whole deal for me.
I'm not paying you for the lovemaking, Hawk. I just want you to have whatever you needed the money for when you took me up on my offer.
You're a little scrawny, but thanks to the concert we're low on amateurs. Name?
Hawk.
Hawk.
Pick a song, Hawk.
Pick a song, Hawk.
Got any KISS?
Got any KISS?
You kidding? This is Detroit. Drink?
You kidding? This is Detroit. Drink?
Yeah, a man's drink...
What's that?
You mean you never seen a Jack Daniels on the rocks before?
Sure, I have. But not one with ice in it, that's all.
Save your money, stud muffin. The lady at the end of the bar sends her love.
Whoa... she is a killer.
Amanda Finch. Her ex is one of the wealthiest businessmen in Detroit. Play your cards right and you could hit paydirt. She like 'em young. And since you look a little new at this, let me give you three words of advice. Hard to get. Think it, act it, know it, be it. Nothing a woman loves more than when you beat her at
Oh, Dicky, I c-c-can't...
You're not gonna chicken out on me now, are you? We've got your KISS song playing and everything.
You're not gonna chicken out on me now, are you? We've got your KISS song playing and everything.
I-I c-can't...
I-I c-can't...
Look, people undress in public because, A, they're exhibitionists, B, they're nutcases, or C, they need the money. I can tell you're not A, and I hope to hell you're not B. So my suggestion is, think about why you're a C and let your body party, shake your groove thing, boogie oogie oogie till you just can't boogie no more.
No problem.
Thanks.
Sorry.
It's okay.
Jeremiah?
Yeah?
Beth? I can't believe it.
Believe it.
I didn't mean for that to be so... intense. Forgive me.
I don't care. I wanna hear more.
I've loved you ever since I first laid eyes on you, Jeremiah. I've just always been too scared to show it.
Beth, I can't believe you just said that because that's exactly how I've always felt about you... Call me Jam. It's my band name.
Beth, I can't believe you just said that because that's exactly how I've always felt about you... Call me Jam. It's my band name.
You don't know how long I've been waiting to hear that... Jam!
We've got to take this slow...
Right, slow...
Right, slow...
Oh, screw it!
So. Is it true that Gene Simmons had a cow's tongue grafted onto his real one? Y'know, to make it so long?
I dunno. I think he had the piece of skin under his tongue removed so he could stick it out farther. I'm not too up on Gene trivia.

Your man is the drummer, Peter Criss, right?
Your man is the drummer, Peter Criss, right?
Peter Criss is my inspiration, man. If I paid a hundred bucks for a KISS show and all I saw was his solo, I'd consider it... money... Hey, how'd you know that?

I have all your notebook doodles memorized, Jam... Here.
Ann Arbor?
My dad's company is relocating him. We're moving. That's why I was acting so freaky in school today. I thought it was the last time I'd ever see you. Anyway, open the box. I would have given it to you this morning, except... like I said, I was freaking out.
Ann Arbor isn't... that far from Cleveland, right?
Nah. Once I get my own wheels, I could come up all the time.
Nah. Once I get my own wheels, I could come up all the time.
That'd be great. Hey, maybe someday your band'll play there. It's a college town, you know?
I feel like such an idiot. Why didn't I just say something a year and a half ago? Man, think of how much time we wasted.
Let's not think about the past. Let's just think about from today on. I'll never forget you, Jam.
Let's not think about the past. Let's just think about from today on. I'll never forget you, Jam.
Tell me about it. Church will never be the same again.
Coming dad. I'll call you. Soon as we get a phone. Bye.
Bye.
Oh, great. I just hitched a ride with a bunch of potheads... I'm hooking up with some people at this funky place in downtown Detroit called Disco Inferno. Mind droppin' me there?
What's it worth to you?
What's it worth to you?
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
So, are you, like, gonna polish our nobs, or what?
What? That's disgusting!
Tease? What the hell did I do to tease you mongoloids?
You got in the car, didn't you?
You got in the car, didn't you?
Oh, God, how calculating of me to lead you all on like that after you offered me a ride in the middle of nowhere.
Oh, God, how calculating of me to lead you all on like that after you offered me a ride in the middle of nowhere.
Whatever... stella.
What are you, high?
Yeah.
Yeah.
For once Lex is right. It's over. Things can't get any worse from here.
Wonder if you could smoke shit out of this?
Maybe some tunage'll chase those blues away.
This is the best thing that ever happened to me at school! Not only are we on again for KISS in Detroit, but we're actually sitting right at the fifty yard line! I dare you dudes to find a curlier scenario.
Stan Lee couldn't think of a better one.
Namely?
Our band "Mystery" is a quartet and we can't go on the road without our drummer. Jam's mom said something about sending him to St. Bernard's, right? We gotta bust him out before we go anywhere.
Well, the least we, his only buds in the world, can do is take him along with us tonight and give him one last curl before he starts serving his sentence.
Just for the record, I understood the last part of what you said, but for a while there you guys were making no fucking sense whatsoever.
Just for the record, I understood the last part of what you said, but for a while there you guys were making no fucking sense whatsoever.
I was just explaining to Lex here what you and I already know. Just had to make it a little more complicated so he'd understand.
I'm starvin' and it's way past lunchtime.
Totally. All I've had for chow was a packet of Pop Rocks and a Yoo-hoo.
Let's stop in Sandusky, Hawk.
What's in Sandusky?
What's in Sandusky?
Pizza, and I been jones-in' for a pizza ever since we left St. Bernard's.
You call that John Travolta/Denny Terio shit dancing? I wouldn't dance like that in private if you paid me.
Disco blows dogs for quarters.
What was that D.J.'s name again?
Oh, I'll remember it till the day I die. His name was... Simpleton the Simian? No, Samson Samoan... No, simply, similar...
I have one question. How could a kid who wails on the drums like it's the only thing keeping him alive even think of such a femmy thing to say?
Really, Jam, you tryin' to make us barf?
So maybe we got enough for one ticket. Fuck!
Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! We find four really small kids, beat the shit outta them and steal their tickets. What do you think?
Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! We find four really small kids, beat the shit outta them and steal their tickets. What do you think?
Brilliance, Trip. Sheer brilliance. Give Albert Einstein here the Nobel Prize.
...at twenty-thirty hours.
One more time in English.
One more time in English.
For the next hour and a half it's every dude for himself. Try to get at least one ticket and at 8:30 P.M. we'll meet over there.
Any luck?
Plenty, but it was all bad.
Will somebody please tell those chicks disco is dead.
Stellas. I hate stellas almost as much as I hate dogs.
Shit, that dork is Jam.
YO, DOOFUS!
Yeah, she gives you shit and you take it.
Okay, enough. Enough. Gimme the tickets. I wanna hold onto them.
Second floor girls' john! Two minutes! He'll never look there!
Check!
That's Sherry VanHafton.
I've been in love with her since the second grade.
Whoa... she just farted.
I have never heard a girl squeeze cheese in my entire life.
I have never heard a girl squeeze cheese in my entire life.
Weird...
Too bad we're stuck in electronics or...
Never mind with the too bad shit. I got a crazy plan, but only the craziest among us can pull it off.
But... but, St. Bernard's is way the hell over in the next county!
So? Your mom's car has a CB, radar detector and cruise control, check?
So? Your mom's car has a CB, radar detector and cruise control, check?
We are not stealing my mom's car.
We are not stealing my mom's car.
Damn straight we are.
Damn straight we are.
Hawk, all I need is one ding on the Volvo and presto! There are my balls hanging from the rearview mirror after she gets back from Cincinnati.

And when is she due back from that groinecologist's convention anyway?
And when is she due back from that groinecologist's convention anyway?
Sunday, but...
Sunday, but...
Then lighten up. She'll never know we touched it. Alright, here's the plan. We bus it to chez Lex, grab the Volvo, bail Jam the hell outta St. Bernard's and arrive at the train station precisely on time for the 2:45 to Detroit.
There's only so much trouble an individual can get into till it just doesn't matter anymore, Lex. You familiar with a condition known as Absolute Zero?
The hypothetical temperature characterized by the absence of heat and even the slightest amount of molecular activity? Yeah, I'm vaguely familiar
The hypothetical temperature characterized by the absence of heat and even the slightest amount of molecular activity? Yeah, I'm vaguely familiar
Well, Jam is in absolute trouble. He couldn't get any deeper into shit if he was a fly sitting in a horse's ass. You know as well as me he'd give his right arm just to see Peter Criss's drum solo, never mind a whole KISS concert, check?
Very funny, Hawk. Okay, I'm in on this hare-brained scheme, but if anything happens to my mom's car, I'm blaming you. I'll say you drugged me or something.
Curly.
Ok, dudes, follow my lead.
Wait a minute. We ditching the rest of school?
Now, how are we gonna do this?
Gimme a second, dudes. Lemme think.
We got you a change of duds when we picked up the car.
Next stop: the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City!
Jeezis, Hawk, can you at least keep it within twenty miles of the speed limit?
Lex, am I gonna have to lock you in the trunk till we reach Detroit? Don't worry, these babies are built for speed.
What the fuck!
The paint!
Uh... dudes?
Now there's a woman who totally abuses the privilege of motherhood.
Now there's a woman who totally abuses the privilege of motherhood.
DUDES!
Here's a suggestion. Let's stop worrying about the concert for the time being and get the cops in on this Volvo situation.
Wake up, Lex. This is Detroit. The cops aren't gonna waste city dollars looking for a Swedish car. Face it, the Volvo's on a cutting board as we speak getting sliced, diced, and julienned by Christine, the chop shop gourmet.
Now listen up. Here's the game plan.
...I mean, my mom's got insurance. What's the worst thing she could do? Ground me for the entire year? I can handle that...
...I mean, my mom's got insurance. What's the worst thing she could do? Ground me for the entire year? I can handle that...
Cool, bro, now listen up...
Cool, bro, now listen up...
...Holy shit! I am in absolute trouble! I never should have let you drive, man! Absolute fuckin' trouble!
...Holy shit! I am in absolute trouble! I never should have let you drive, man! Absolute fuckin' trouble!
Okay, shut the fuck up, Lex! Now, then, step number one, we find us a scalper. I got... twenty-five.
I think we should try sneaking in.
Four dudes sneaking in? We'd get busted fer sure. Bad plan.
Four dudes sneaking in? We'd get busted fer sure. Bad plan.
Okay, one of us sneaks in, gets four ticket stubs off some kids in the audience, comes back out, and we all "re-enter" the concerto. Voila!
Okay, one of us sneaks in, gets four ticket stubs off some kids in the audience, comes back out, and we all "re-enter" the concerto. Voila!
Still too risky for my money. We're running out of time here. This is KISS! A victory for one is a victory for the team. I'm sure I can barter with a scalper, but if you dudes think you got better plans, go for it. We'll reconvene at that intersection...
I found the Volvo.
Tickets?
No... You don't think...?
Nah. Couldn't be.
Do you realize the sheer, goddamn, unadulterated, undiluted, no holds barred, one hundred percent pure as Ivory Snow, absolutely friggin' STUPIDITY of what you just did?
Hey, disco dude, it's cool...
Could be.
And if it ain't cleaned off?
Are you gettin' wise with me?
No, I'm dumber than a goddamn slug. Now can I please clean your windshield and leave without further ado?
Well, let's recap, shall we? You slapped all of us, yelled at me, used my head for a rag, threw me on the ground and tossed our LOVE GUN 8- track under the wheels of a passing semi. So, if the lesson was that you're a dick with ears and a really bad haircut, then, yes... I'd say we learned it.
Excuse me, I'm a little deef-a- hearin'. Can you repeat yourself?
Excuse me, I'm a little deef-a- hearin'. Can you repeat yourself?
Okay. Ahem! You. Are. A. Dick. With. Ears. And. A. Really. Bad. Haircut.
Okay. Ahem! You. Are. A. Dick. With. Ears. And. A. Really. Bad. Haircut.
Oh, yeah...?
How would you like a nice Hawaiian Punch?
Sure.
Dude, this is all I got.
Sorry, man, no can do. But I'll be here for a while if you scare up the extra gravy.
Sorry, man, no can do. But I'll be here for a while if you scare up the extra gravy.
Where the hell am I gonna scare up that kinda gravy in one hour?
Where the hell am I gonna scare up that kinda gravy in one hour?
The easy way.
You look a little scrawny, but it's worth a shot.
I can't just walk in and take my clothes off. It's embarrasskin.
I can't just walk in and take my clothes off. It's embarrasskin.
Guess you don't want to see the greatest show on earth. And in Detroit no less. Well, take care, chief.
Dude, if it were dancing the way Fred Astaire did it, I'd give it my best shot. I'd learn the steps and practice in my spare time. But this... tribal, ritualistic bullshit, it's way-too-spontaneous for me.
Yeah, you're probably too young anyhow.
Yeah, you're probably too young anyhow.
Hey, I invented fake I.D.s, alright. That's not the problem... They're playing disco music in there, man.
Hey, I invented fake I.D.s, alright. That's not the problem... They're playing disco music in there, man.
Chief, here's a little secret. Drink heavily, your feet will know what to do. Now shit or get off the pot. Do you wanna dance or do you wanna see KISS only on their album covers?
Jam, listen up.
Hawk?
Hawk?
Just listen up, man, cause we are in a quandary.
Are you on the crapper with one of those antenna phones? Sounds like you're taking a dump the size of Butte, Montana.
It's my Bullworker.
It's my Bullworker.
Anyway, listen up. They're gone!
Anyway, listen up. They're gone!
What's gone?
What's gone?
The KISS tickets, you nimrod! They're just fuckin' gone! Please tell me you have'm!
The KISS tickets, you nimrod! They're just fuckin' gone! Please tell me you have'm!
Gone!? Why would I have the KISS tick...?
Gone!? Why would I have the KISS tick...?
Just check whatever you were wearing last night. Now!
Cool.
I'm really sorry about that, man.
I'm really sorry about that, man.
Don't be a fembot. So, are you like grounded because of last night, or what?
Don't be a fembot. So, are you like grounded because of last night, or what?
Of course, but has that ever stopped me before? Besides, my mom's going to some church meeting and won't be back till late. No sweat... See you guys in school.
They're still at my house in Trip's jacket.
They're what?
They're what?
She was standing right over me when I was changing for fuck's sake.
Don't worry about it. They're perfectly safe. We can pick them up after school. My mom won't be home. It's no problem.
All right. After school we double- time it to your house for the tix before heading to the train station for the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City.
All right. After school we double- time it to your house for the tix before heading to the train station for the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City.
Check.
If he offers you a slice, you're not the least bit hungry, check?
Check.
Don't you think we should at least pull over and offer to clean it off?
What?! Are you mentally deranged, Jam?
Oh no, Jam. I'm not falling for that twice.
Well, couldn't you slow down so I can at least state my case, Hawk? If you don't like it, you can speed up and I'll never mention it again.
It doesn't mean anything. Don't pay attention to him.
Disco Inferno? Disco's infernal morelike.
Hey, Look at the front entrance! A car's pulling out. The parking space from heaven. God is surely smiling down upon us tonight, dudes.
Kind of funny, I thought He'd be pissed as hell at me.
Oh, I'm sorry, Trip. What you made was a big, brainless, pile of horse shit. No offense.
Guys, GUYS! Come on, if this is anyone's fault, it's mine. I was the one who grabbed Trip's jacket by mistake. It's my fault and I apologize.
Guys, GUYS! Come on, if this is anyone's fault, it's mine. I was the one who grabbed Trip's jacket by mistake. It's my fault and I apologize.
Please, Jam, we're trying to vent some hostility here. Sure the whole thing may be your fault, but who's gonna get pissed off at you?
It was stolen!
Christine stole it! Asleep, my ass! The stella booted with your mom's wheels.
I'm sorry, guys. I thought it was a nice thing to do.
Jam, not another word out of your femmy-ass mouth! Okay, we're here, we got nothing, and we got an hour and a half. We're totally committed. It's time to brainstorm.
I got...
Uh-uh. Don't tell us, Jam. Just show us.
Wait! I know how we can get in!
Jam, shut-up! You're not allowed to speak, remember? Go use whatever femmy idea you have to get yourself a ticket or four. I don't wanna hear it.
Jam, shut-up! You're not allowed to speak, remember? Go use whatever femmy idea you have to get yourself a ticket or four. I don't wanna hear it.
But... my plan involves all four of us acting together.
But... my plan involves all four of us acting together.
See you at 8:30, Jam. Later. Dudes? Later.
Well... I still got my idea if anybody will let me speak.
Go ahead, Jam.
Go ahead, Jam.
We all beat each other up, then, once we're nice and bruised, we run over to the ticket takers and say we got mugged and our tickets were stolen. They gotta let us in then.
Oh, hi, mom.
NOW!
Jeremiah, what are you doing?
Uhh... nothing.
Ahh, sunshine.
You're going to be late if you don't hurry up and change soon.
You're going to be late if you don't hurry up and change soon.
Change? What's wrong with what I got on?
Change? What's wrong with what I got on?
It's dirty laundry for one thing and for another, you still haven't worn the clothes I bought you. You're skating on thin ice already, young man, so I wouldn't push my luck. Now get out of those rags.
It's dirty laundry for one thing and for another, you still haven't worn the clothes I bought you. You're skating on thin ice already, young man, so I wouldn't push my luck. Now get out of those rags.
But, mom!
But, mom!
Besides, those jeans are so tight I can see your penis.
They're not idiots.
Now don't forget you're on the honor system tonight. I'll be home a little after one and if you've been partying or playing that satanic KISS music... well, need I remind you of the consequences?
Now don't forget you're on the honor system tonight. I'll be home a little after one and if you've been partying or playing that satanic KISS music... well, need I remind you of the consequences?
Grounded for the rest of the year?
Grounded for the rest of the year?
You're a smart boy, Jeremiah. And so handsome.
I made an appointment with Father Phillip McNulty at St. Bernard's. We're to see him directly where he will register you on the spot.
You mean, you're sending me to... b- b-boarding school?
You mean, you're sending me to... b- b-boarding school?
What else can I do? Oh, records and magazines and comic books are one thing, but tickets? TICKETS? Jeremiah, do you realize what this means? That you're no longer content merely hearing their awful songs or looking at photos of their horrific faces! Now you want to see the devil in the flesh. You want to reach out and touch pure evil... and in
Someday you'll have a son just like you, Jeremiah. A boy who lies through his teeth, buys demonic records, and smokes the dope just like you.
If I'm anything like you, I'll deserve him.
If I'm anything like you, I'll deserve him.
What?!
What?!
I said, I'm sorry!
I said, I'm sorry!
If you truly are sorry, son, then you better pray like you've never prayed before. God willed me to find those tickets because He wanted to hear from you. He knows you need help and He wants you to ask Him for it.
Mom, what're we...?
Just keep your lying, heathenous trap shut, Jeremiah.
Jeremiah... what's gotten into you?
I just lost my virginity in a confessional booth! Lord have mercy!!
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. This is my first confession in... well... a really long time.
Prepare to receive the Act of Penance. How many sins have you committed since your last confession?
Prepare to receive the Act of Penance. How many sins have you committed since your last confession?
Just one, Father, but boy was it a doozy.
So, you see if it wasn't for me, me and my friends would be at that KISS concert right now... together.
That's it?
That's it?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, this is a unique confession to say the least, son. And not exactly the most interesting one I've ever heard either. You sure you don't want to talk about... oh, carnal knowledge with a neighborhood girl or impure thoughts about the new student teacher maybe... or how about finding a box of magazines under your dad's bed?

You sure you don't want to talk about... oh, carnal knowledge with a neighborhood girl or impure thoughts about the new student teacher maybe... or how about finding a box of magazines under your dad's bed?
No.
No.
Well then, I suggest you have a seat on the bench behind you and think of something a little juicier to confess than losing KISS tickets. I realize this is Detroit, but I personally find, what that rock and roll band is all about, to be boring as Lucifer's kingdom. I'll return in a little while.
Okay, you better have something really sinful for me this time, son. My patience is worn to threads and your mom will be here any minute.
Alright, Father, here it is. About two weeks ago I went to my cousin's wedding and one of the bridesmaids asked me if I wanted to take a bath.
Alright, Father, here it is. About two weeks ago I went to my cousin's wedding and one of the bridesmaids asked me if I wanted to take a bath.
No...
I was insulted, so I asked her if I was wreaking some wicked b.o., right? Then she said no, she wanted to take a bath with me.
Oh, this is terrible... Please go on.
Oh, this is terrible... Please go on.
Well, she was a very tempting siren, Father. Built like you wouldn't believe. So I gave into temptation about a block away from the wedding reception at this little motel that charges by the hour.
Well? Continue! Continue!
Okay... when she peeled off that gown, you'll never guess what she was wearing underneath.
Okay... when she peeled off that gown, you'll never guess what she was wearing underneath.
Was it a teddy?
No. Much bet... I mean, much more sinful than that.
A bustier?
A bustier?
Tell you what. You keep guessing and I'll say something when you get it.
Tell you what. You keep guessing and I'll say something when you get it.
Splendid! I love a good game of Name That Nightie.
Jam has yet to do an overnight with us.
I had a nightmare once that something like this might happen. I hope he doesn't get grounded again. If he misses Peter Criss's drum solo, I don't know if he'll be able to handle it.
Poor, Jam, man. Imagine having to stash your KISS records inside Carly Simon album covers. No question, Mrs. Bruce is a psycho-bitch from hell.
You're one to talk, Lex. Your mom's a fuckin' dyke.
Trip, a female gynecologist does not a lesbian make. And even if it did, at least my mom didn't give birth to me while she was on LSD.
Shrooms! And even if it was LSD, I can still give my mom a kiss without smelling the catch of the day.
Trip, you fuckin' asshole.
What?
Yeah, right. She wishes. Look at that big ass.
You know what they say about a big ass... big shit.
That's some sick shit right there. Did she comb your ass hair for you too?
If your mom so much as smells those tickets, they're history, and we get screwed outta seeing KISS for the third year in a row, the third year!
I knew it! I knew this was gonna happen! I had a bad feeling since last night. Remember? We are so totally fucked!
Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! Maybe we can glue the tickets back together!
Hey, take it easy, man. This is the girls' crapper, remember?
Wake up, Lex! We just watched Jam's mom torch our fuckin' KISS tickets! Not REO Speedwagon! Not Journey! Not the Bay City Rollers! KISS! If you can think of a better reason to trash a bathroom, I'd sure like to hear it!
Wake up, Lex! We just watched Jam's mom torch our fuckin' KISS tickets! Not REO Speedwagon! Not Journey! Not the Bay City Rollers! KISS! If you can think of a better reason to trash a bathroom, I'd sure like to hear it!
Trip, it's not the end of the world, okay? Quit acting all squeezed out.
Oh, everything's hunky-dory now that the shit hit the fan just like you said it would, you snug sonofabitch! You fuckin' jinxed us!
Smug, Trip! Not snug, smug.
I did it! I did it! We won!
We won?!
The Chinese have a proverb: "That which appears too good to be true, usually is." There's gotta be a catch.
Yeah? I have a saying too, Lex. It goes, "Catch my jizz in your mouth and stop jinxing us, asshole." We're going this time and that's all there is to it.
Simplicity, Hawk.
Simple-icity is more like it. And you guys thought Jam was in trouble before. Wait till Mrs. Bruce finds out he went to that concert with us.
About fuckin' time if you ask me. I'm just going through the motions till I drop out anyway.
Hello summer detention.
Well, here we are back at fucking school again.
Huh. St. Bernard's. Figures it's named after a canine.
Eyowch! This is one hot pizza!
Trip, huck that out before it stains the upholstery!
Man, that weed knocked Christine on her ass. She's sleeping like a baby stella.
Let's lift up her shirt.
Really, Trip, can we bore holes in your head and use it as a bong so it actually does us some good for a change?
Fuck you, Lex! This whole thing wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for you jinxing us. I just made an honest mistake.
It's gone.
I can see that, bright boy. What happened to it?
But we took the keys?
Damn, she musta hot wired it. We picked up a professional car thief in the shape of Olivia Newton-John!
Damn, she musta hot wired it. We picked up a professional car thief in the shape of Olivia Newton-John!
Okay, I'm just a little mad now! Jam, why'd you talk us into picking that bitch up in the first place!?
Twenty-five more'n I got.
All I got is five. The rest is in the Volvo.
Please sir, don't beat me up. I do have a KISS ticket, but not on me.
A likely story. Hand it over, kid.
A likely story. Hand it over, kid.
No really. My brother's hanging onto it for safe keeping. Please, let me get him for you.
Hey, kid, that's okay. I don't wanna see KISS that ba...
Don't try to run, maggot. Chongo's an all-state track star in every event.
Don't try to run, maggot. Chongo's an all-state track star in every event.
What do you want?
What do you want?
A tag on your toe. Nobody threatens me and lives.
A tag on your toe. Nobody threatens me and lives.
Look, you can have my wallet...
Look, you can have my wallet...
It's not nearly enough, punk.
Please, sir, don't kick my ass! I'll do anything to get out of a beating!
Say, Chongo, perhaps we could use some extra cash for tasty snacks at the KISS concert our weasly friend won't be attending.
Two hundred bucks?
You heard me, nad breath. My time's precious and I think that's a reasonable price to pay for your sorry life.
You heard me, nad breath. My time's precious and I think that's a reasonable price to pay for your sorry life.
Look, I want to live, but I don't know where the fuck I'm gonna find two hundred bucks.
Oh, yeah! You and what army?
The KISS Army!
Gimme your gun, boy!
No, you gimme your gun, boy!
No, you gimme your gun, boy!
Don't tempt me, I'll shoot!
Don't tempt me, I'll shoot!
Not if I shoot first!

I don't even think you have a gun!

Neither do I!
Simple Simon on the Rock, go caller.
Hello? Is this me? I'm Trip. Am I on the air?
Hello? Is this me? I'm Trip. Am I on the air?
I should hang up on you right now, but you're the right caller so answer quick or get your battleship sunk. What are the names of the four members of KISS?
I should hang up on you right now, but you're the right caller so answer quick or get your battleship sunk. What are the names of the four members of KISS?
Gene Klein, Stanley Eisen, Paul Frehley, and Peter...Criscula! Yeah, that's it!
Is that your final answer?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Trip? You just got yourself four tickets and four backstage passes to KISS live at Cobo Hall tonight!
I did?
Yeah, you did!
Yeah, you did!
Yeeeehaaawww!! This is totally fuckin' curly, man! Thank you God!
Yeeeehaaawww!! This is totally fuckin' curly, man! Thank you God!
Whoa, easy, Trip, this is radio, not "Taxi Driver." Now listen up cause this next part is crucial. Stay on the line so we can get your full name, information, and...
Good morning, mongrels!
Good morning...
Good morning...
That's all the gusta you can musta? I said, "Good morning!"
That's all the gusta you can musta? I said, "Good morning!"
Good MORNING!
Good MORNING!
Now that's better... but I still sense some students out there... who are AFRAID... just to say GOOD MORNING!
Now that's better... but I still sense some students out there... who are AFRAID... just to say GOOD MORNING!
GOOD MORNING!
GOOD MORNING!
Are you AFRAID?
Are you AFRAID?
GOOD MORNING!
GOOD MORNING!
Now that's what I like to hear! Because too many young men and women today are paralysed by their fears. They give in to their feelings of self-doubt... they surrender their bodies to the temptations of drugs, alcohol and premarital sex. Empty solutions. These are toxic chemicals... and disease-spreading behaviour.
Hi... what's going on here?
Horrible accident. My neighbour... he got killed.
Horrible accident. My neighbour... he got killed.
What happened?
What happened?
He got smooshed. By a jet engine.
What was his name?
Donnie. Donnie Darko.
I feel bad for his family.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Did you know him?
Dr. Monnitoff?
Donnie.
Donnie.
I know that this is gonna sound kinda weird... but do you know anything about time travel?
So... according to Hawking... wormholes might be able to provide a short cut for jumping between two distant regions of space-time.
So... in order to travel back in time, you'd have to have a big spaceship or something that can travel faster than the speed of light --

Theoretically.

A wormhole with an Einstein-Rosen bridge, which is, theoretically... a wormhole in space controlled by man.

So... that's it?
So... that's it?
The basic principles of time travel are there. So you have the vessel and the portal. And the vessel can be anything. Most likely a spacecraft.
Like a DeLorean.
A metal craft of any kind.
What effect do you think this would have on an infant?
Well... the thing is, nobody remembers their infancy. And anyone who says they do is lying. We think that this would help develop memory earlier in life.

Did you stop and think that maybe infants need darkness? That darkness is part of their natural development.
Each vessel travels along a vector path through space-time... along its centre of gravity.
Like a spear.
Like a spear.
Beg pardon?
Beg pardon?
Like a spear that comes out of your stomach?
Like a spear that comes out of your stomach?
Uhh... sure. And in order for the vessel to travel through time it must find the portal, in this case the wormhole, or some unforeseen portal that lies undiscovered.

Could these wormholes appear in nature?

That... is highly unlikely. You're talking about an act of God.
That... is highly unlikely. You're talking about an act of God.
If God controls time... then all time is pre-decided. Then every living thing travels along a set path.

I'm not following you.

If you could see your path or channel growing out of your stomach, you could see into the future. And that's a form of time travel, right?

You are contradicting yourself, Donnie. If we could see our destines manifest themselves visually... then we would be given the choice to betray our chosen destinies. The very fact that this choice exists... would mean that all pre-formed destiny would end.

Not if you chose to stay within God's channel...
Not if you chose to stay within God's channel...
Donnie, I'm afraid I can't continue this conversation. I could lose my job.
When can I squeeze one out?
Not until like... eighth grade.
Why do I have to sleep with Donnie? He stinks.
When you fall asleep tonight, I'm gonna fart in your face.
When you fall asleep tonight, I'm gonna fart in your face.
I'm telling Mom.
What happens if you tell Mom and Dad about this, Samantha?
You'll put Ariel in the garbage disposal.
"The Last Unicorn!" By Samantha Darko.
Donnie! Give it back!
Did you tell them that I flooded the school?
I didn't say shit.
I didn't say shit.
That's not what I heard. Now they think I did it.
That's not what I heard. Now they think I did it.
Well, if you're innocent, then you have nothing to worry about.

You know what? I think that you did it.
Dea ex machina...
What did you say?
What did you say?
Our saviour...
How can you do that?
I can do anything I want... and so can you...
Why did you make me flood the school?
We just want to guide you in the right direction.
We just want to guide you in the right direction.
Who is... we?
Who is... we?
You'll know soon enough.
You'll know soon enough.
Where did you come from?
Where did you come from?
Do you believe in time travel, Donnie?
I want to show you something.
You have to do something for me first.
You have to do something for me first.
You have a request?
You have a request?
Yeah. Tell me why you're wearing that stupid bunny suit.
Yeah. Tell me why you're wearing that stupid bunny suit.
Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?
Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?
Take it off. I want to see you.
What happened to your eye?
I am so sorry.
I am so sorry.
Why do they call you Frank?
Why do they call you Frank?
It is the name of my father... and his father before me.
It is the name of my father... and his father before me.
How much longer is this gonna last?
How much longer is this gonna last?
You should already know that. Watch the movie, Donnie. I have something to show you.
DARKO CHEATS DEATH! Man... you're famous! I called you, like, a jillion times last night!
We went to a hotel.
We went to a hotel.
My dad said he found you on the golf course. Are you sleepwalking again?
My dad said he found you on the golf course. Are you sleepwalking again?
I don't wanna talk about it.
How old is Grandma Death?
A hundred and one, I think. Every day she does the same thing. But there's never any mail.
What'd you do, Donnie? What'd you do!
Go home. Go home and tell your parents that everything is going to be just fine.
Hey...
Hey...
Hey...
School's cancelled.
Wanna walk me home?
Sure.
Don't look so freaked.
I'm not. But you should check your backpack 'cause those guys like to steal shit.
I'm not. But you should check your backpack 'cause those guys like to steal shit.
Fuck them.
So... you just moved here?
Yeah. My parents got divorced. My mom has a restraining order against my stepdad. He has... emotional problems.
Yeah. My parents got divorced. My mom has a restraining order against my stepdad. He has... emotional problems.
Oh, I... have those too. What kind of problems does your dad have?
Oh, I... have those too. What kind of problems does your dad have?
He stabbed my mom four times in the chest.
Wow. Did he go to jail?
He fled. They still can't find him. My mom and I had to change our names and stuff. I thought Gretchen sounded kind of cool.
He fled. They still can't find him. My mom and I had to change our names and stuff. I thought Gretchen sounded kind of cool.
I'm sorry. I was in jail once. I accidentally burned down this house. It was abandoned. I got held back in school again. Can't drive until I'm eighteen. I think when I grow up I want to be a painter. Or maybe a writer or maybe both. Then I'll write a book and draw the illustrations like a comic book. You know, change things.

Donnie Darko is a cool name. Sounds like a superhero.
Donnie Darko is a cool name. Sounds like a superhero.
What makes you think I'm not?
I should go. For physics. Monnitoff says I have to write an essay on the greatest invention ever to benefit mankind.
That's easy. Antiseptics.
I mean, the whole sanitation thing. Joseph Lister... 1895. Before antiseptics there was no sanitation, especially in medicine.
You mean soap?
You mean soap?
Don't knock soap. Without it, disease would spread rapidly. If we ran out... you and I would never live to see the year 2000.
Don't knock soap. Without it, disease would spread rapidly. If we ran out... you and I would never live to see the year 2000.
Wonder where we'll be then.
Wonder where we'll be then.
The best thing about soap is that it's the only thing on earth that can never get dirty. No matter what crap you throw on it... it always rubs off. And there it is again... perfect.

Until it withers away.
It's a good thing the school was flooded today.
Why is that?
Why is that?
We never would have had this conversation.
You're weird.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
That was a compliment.
That was a compliment.
Will you go with me?
Will you go with me?
Where are we going?
Where are we going?
No... I mean, will you GO with me? That's like... what they call it here. Going together.
No... I mean, will you GO with me? That's like... what they call it here. Going together.
Sure.
Where are you going?
I'm going home.
So when you sleepwalk, can you remember afterward? Like, do you dream?
No. I just wake up and I look around, try to figure out where I am... how I got there.
No. I just wake up and I look around, try to figure out where I am... how I got there.
My dad said never wake a sleepwalker... because they could drop dead.
It's like this big force... that's in your brain. But sometimes it grows bigger... and it spread down into your arms and legs... and it just sends you someplace.
So when you sleepwalk, you go somewhere familiar?
So when you sleepwalk, you go somewhere familiar?
No. Every time I wake up somewhere different. Sometimes my bike is laying there next to me. Like once when I woke up on the edge of this cliff up on Carpathian Ridge.
No. Every time I wake up somewhere different. Sometimes my bike is laying there next to me. Like once when I woke up on the edge of this cliff up on Carpathian Ridge.
And you'd never been there before?
Donnie?
Yeah?
Yeah?
Do you ever feel as though there's always someone watching you?
Do you ever feel as though there's always someone watching you?
Why?
Why?
Well... maybe someone is, like... giving you these dream steroids. And sleepwalking ...is someone showing you the way.
What happened to your neck?
I don't want to talk about it. So what happened to your neck?
Babies cry because they're afraid of the dark. And because they have no memories... for all they know... every night could be the last forever. Like, perpetual darkness.
Why not just buy your baby a night light?
Why not just buy your baby a night light?
That's not good enough. You've got to go back in time and take all those hours of darkness and pain and replace them... with whatever you wanted.
That's not good enough. You've got to go back in time and take all those hours of darkness and pain and replace them... with whatever you wanted.
With, like, images?
With, like, images?
Like... a Hawaiian sunset... the Grand Canyon. Things that remind you how beautiful the world can be.
You know... we've been going together for a week and a half...
And what?
And what?
Well...
Well...
You want to kiss me...
That's alright... I understand.
No... Donnie, wait. I've never...
No... Donnie, wait. I've never...
I always wanted it to be at a time when... when it reminds you how beautiful the world can be.
I always wanted it to be at a time when... when it reminds you how beautiful the world can be.
Yeah. And right now there's some fat guy over there watching us.
We're moving through time.
What?
They suspended me for two days.
Are you okay?
Are you okay?
I've been seeing stuff... a lot of really messed-up stuff. Do you know who Grandma Death is?
I've been seeing stuff... a lot of really messed-up stuff. Do you know who Grandma Death is?
Who?
Who?
The old crazy woman who lives off Old Gun Road.
Oh, yeah. "The Philosophy of Time Travel". What is this?
She wrote it. There are chapters in this book that describe the stuff I've been seeing. It can't just be a coincidence. Will you come see her with me?
I know she's here. She never leaves the house.
Maybe she's asleep.
So, we call them... IMGs.
Infant Memory Generators.
Infant Memory Generators.
Yeah. So the idea is that... you buy these glasses for your infant, and they wear them at night when they sleep.
Yeah. So the idea is that... you buy these glasses for your infant, and they wear them at night when they sleep.
And inside these glasses are these slide photographs. And each photograph is of something peaceful... or beautiful. Whatever pictures the parent wants to put inside.
What? How long was I asleep?
The whole movie. Let's go.
You want to skip fourth period and go to the Ridge?
What's wrong with you?
What's wrong with you?
What do you mean?
Will you please talk to me?
Not now, Donnie. It isn't a good time.
Not now, Donnie. It isn't a good time.
Then when? I have to talk to you.
Hey.
Hey. You OK?
Hey. You OK?
My mom is gone.
My mom is gone.
Where is she?
Where is she?
I don't know. She didn't leave a note. The house is all messed up.
I don't know. She didn't leave a note. The house is all messed up.
But you're OK?
Did you call the cops?
Yeah, they told me to get out of the house.
I'm so scared... I just keep thinking that something awful has happened. It's my fucking stepdad. I know it.
It's safe here.
What?
There's something you have to know, Gretchen. Everything is going to be just fine.
Come with me.
Where are we going?
Time is running out. We have to go see Grandma Death. We have to talk to her.
Why? Is this about the book?
Why? Is this about the book?
No. Frank.
No. Frank.
Who's Frank?
Is that a cellar door?
Yeah...
I'm sorry, Ms. Farmer, I just don't get this.
Just place an X in the appropriate place on the Lifeline.
Just place an X in the appropriate place on the Lifeline.
I just don't get this. Everything can't be lumped into two categories. That's too simple.
I just don't get this. Everything can't be lumped into two categories. That's too simple.
The Lifeline is divided that way.

Well, life isn't that simple. So what if Ling Ling kept the cash and returned the wallet? That has nothing to do with either fear or love.
Well, life isn't that simple. So what if Ling Ling kept the cash and returned the wallet? That has nothing to do with either fear or love.
Fear and love are the deepest of human emotions.
Fear and love are the deepest of human emotions.
Well, yeah... OK, but you're not listening to me. There are other things that need to be taken into account here. Like the whole spectrum of human emotion. You're just lumping everything into these two categories... and, like, denying everything else.
People aren't that simple.
If you don't complete the assignment, you'll get a zero for the day.
Will you still be working at Yarn Barn? 'Cause that's a great place to raise children.
No, a year of partying is enough. She'll be going to Harvard this fall.
You're such a fuck-ass.
When did you stop taking your medication?
Oh, please tell me, Elizabeth, how exactly does one suck a fuck?
We will not have this kind of language at the dinner table.
I wish I knew where you went at night. Did you toilet paper the Johnson's house?
I stopped rolling houses in the sixth grade, Mom. Get out of my room.
I stopped rolling houses in the sixth grade, Mom. Get out of my room.
You know... it would be nice to look at you some time... and see my son. I don't recognise this person today.
You know... it would be nice to look at you some time... and see my son. I don't recognise this person today.
Then why don't you start taking the goddamn pills?
Grandma Death.
That is a terrible nickname.
He can't, Samantha. He's been suspended from after-school activities. Donnie... are you still with us? How was your therapy session tonight?
Fine. You know, Dr. Thurman isn't so bad a lady. I can tell her anything.
I have to take the girls to Los Angeles tomorrow.
Do you get to meet Ed?
Do you get to meet Ed?
If I'm lucky. So... I won't be back until the first. Your dad will be back on Sunday, so I've put Elizabeth in charge until then. She has the car... so she can drive you to your therapy tomorrow.

How does it feel to have a wacko for a son?
How does it feel to have a wacko for a son?
It feels wonderful.
So how was school today?
It was great. We had peanut-butter sandwiches and apples and honey at snacktime. And then during show-and- tell, my stuffed walrus was a big hit.

Good Lord. So the construction guys say it'll take about a week to fix the roof. Damn airline better not fuck us on the shingle match.

Do they know yet?
Do they know yet?
Know what?
Know what?
Where it came from?
Where it came from?
No... apparently they can't tell us what happened yet. Something about a matching serial number that got burned. But I had to sign a form saying I wouldn't talk to anyone about it.
No... apparently they can't tell us what happened yet. Something about a matching serial number that got burned. But I had to sign a form saying I wouldn't talk to anyone about it.
So we're not supposed to tell anybody what nobody knows?
So we're not supposed to tell anybody what nobody knows?
You tell Dr. Thurman whatever you want.
Oh, shit!
Grandma Death.
Grandma Death.
You know, Roberta Sparrow. We almost hit her with the car the other day.
You're right. Roberta Sparrow was famous for her gem collections. Kids used to try and steal stuff from her all the time. Over the years... as she got older, she became more and more of a recluse... now she just likes to stay up there all by herself.
I guess she just lost faith in the world.
Who's been giving you weird looks?
A lot of people. Teachers. Younger kids. It's like they're afraid of me for some reason. But that's OK... because I know I deserve it.
You're my only son...
I know, Dad.
I know, Dad.
I know I'm not the best... communicator. But whatever happens in your life... whatever obstacles you come up against... you just say... and do whatever is in your heart. You be honest... and tell the truth... even if they look at you funny... and they will. They'll tell you that you're wrong. They'll call you a fool. But what you've got to understand, son,
Donnie Darko, perhaps, given your recent brush with mass destruction, you can give us your opinion?
Well... they say it right when they are ripping the place to shreds. When they flood the house. That like... destruction is a form of creation. So the fact that they burn the money is... ironic. They just want to see what happens when they tear the world apart. They want to change things.
Who is Frank?
A six-foot-tall bunny rabbit.
And when the other rabbits hear of Fiver's vision, do they believe him? It could be the death of an entire way of life, the end of an era.
Why should we care?
Why should we care?
Because the rabbits are us, Donnie.
Because the rabbits are us, Donnie.
Why should I mourn for a rabbit like it was a human?
Why should I mourn for a rabbit like it was a human?
Is the death of one species less tragic than another?
Is the death of one species less tragic than another?
Of course. A rabbit is not like us. It has no history books... it has no knowledge of sorrow or regret. I like bunnies and all. They're cute... and they're horny. And if you're cute and horny... then you're probably happy that you don't know who you are... or why you're even alive. But the only thing I've known rabbits to do is have
Ms. Pomeroy... what's going on?
Donnie... it's Friday. Shouldn't you be off with your friends, scaring old people?
Donnie... it's Friday. Shouldn't you be off with your friends, scaring old people?
Where are you going?
Where are you going?
I don't know. That's a good question... but suffice to say that I am no longer your English teacher. They fired me.
I don't know. That's a good question... but suffice to say that I am no longer your English teacher. They fired me.
That's bullshit. You're a good teacher.
That's bullshit. You're a good teacher.
Thank you, Donnie. And you're a good student. Lazy... but a good student. Unlike most of the others, you question Mom and Dad's rules.
Thank you, Donnie. And you're a good student. Lazy... but a good student. Unlike most of the others, you question Mom and Dad's rules.
What do I tell the rest of the class when they ask about you?
What do I tell the rest of the class when they ask about you?
Tell them that everything is going to be just fine. It is up to the children to save themselves these days. Because the parents... they don't have a clue.
What's "Cellar Door"?
A famous linguist once said... that of all the phrases in the English language, of all the endless combinations of words in all of history... that "Cellar Door" is the most beautiful.
Cellar door.
Sometimes it's the only thing that keeps us going.
So... will Donnie find his Cellar Door?
I think I already have. But now she won't even talk to me.
I think I already have. But now she won't even talk to me.
Then go find her, Donnie. Don't let her get away. She was right about the rabbits. Go.
Your mother said that you've been skipping cycles of your medication.
I've been taking it. I just like to make her feel guilty for all of this. You know, abuse her. Psychologically.
I've been taking it. I just like to make her feel guilty for all of this. You know, abuse her. Psychologically.
All of this... certainly isn't your mother's fault, Donald.
So, I met a new friend.
Would you like to talk about this friend?
Would you like to talk about this friend?
His name is Frank.

I think he saved my life.

How so?

Don't you watch the news?
Don't you watch the news?
I don't own a television.
I don't own a television.
A jet engine fell on my house... landed on my bed. While I was talking to Frank on the golf course.
Frank... instructed you... to get out of bed... just before this happened.
He said to follow him.
He said to follow him.
Follow him where?
Follow him where?
Into the future. Then he said that the world was coming to an end.
Do you believe that the world is coming to an end?
No. That's stupid.
And when I clap my hands twice, you will wake up. Do you understand?
Yes.
Yes.
So, tell me about your day, Donald.
So, tell me about your day, Donald.
I met a girl.
I met a girl.
What is her name?

I just turn the volume down and think about fucking Alyssa Milano.

What about your family, Donnie?
What about your family, Donnie?
No, I don't think about fucking my family. That's sick!
No, I don't think about fucking my family. That's sick!
Donnie... I want to hear about your friend Frank.
How many times have you seen Frank?

A sign from whom?
A sign from whom?
I think that Frank wants me to go to this woman. She wrote a book about time travel. Frank asked me if I believed in time travel. That can't just be a random coincidence. My dad almost hit her with the car the other day, and she said the creepiest thing. She said that every living creature on this earth dies alone.

No. She died when I was eight. We couldn't find her for days. She went and crawled underneath our back porch...
No. She died when I was eight. We couldn't find her for days. She went and crawled underneath our back porch...
Do you feel alone right now?
I'd like to believe that I'm not... but I've just never seen any proof. So I just choose not to bother with it. It's, like, I could spend my whole life thinking about it... debating it in my head. Weighing the pros and cons. And in the end, I still wouldn't have any proof. So... I don't even debate it any more. Because it's
No. That makes you keep searching.
And they grow out of our stomachs?
It was just like she described them in her book. Like they were alive. The way that they looked... moved... smelled. They were like workers... assigned to each one of us. I followed my spear... and I found something...

Are you embarrassed by these things that you see?
Are you embarrassed by these things that you see?
You know... every week I come in here and I tell you stuff... and it's all embarrassing. I tell you stuff that I don't tell anyone else... and you know what? It's your turn, Dr. Thurman. I'm not saying anything else until you tell me something embarrassing about yourself.
Whoa. That's OK, Dr. Thurman, it's nothing to be embarrassed about. I have sexual fantasies all the time too.
I know.
I know.
I mean... Gretchen... She won't even let me kiss her. She says because it's our first kiss... she's, like, waiting for this big... moment or something. I just don't get it. I just want to get it over with so we can move on to the good stuff.

Have you ever made love, Donald?
And when I clap my hands together twice, you will wake up. Do you understand?
Yes.
Yes.
So, your parents... why did you disappoint them?

I... I was playing with fire.

Is it Frank who wants you to destroy the world, to set the world on fire?

But it was an accident. The house was under construction.

Yes. I flooded my school... and I burned down that pervert's house. I think I only have a few days left... before they catch me.
Why did you do these things, Donnie? Did Frank tell you to commit these crimes?
I have to obey him... because he saved my life. He controls me and I have to obey him or I'll be left all alone... and I'll never figure out what all of this means...
If God exists?
If God exists?
I think now that he might...

Who is he going to kill?
I can see him right now!
Where is he, Donald?
Where is he, Donald?
He's right there... He can read my mind and he'll show me the way out of this. The sky is going to open up... and then He will reveal himself to me.

Your medication. They're placebos. Just pills made out of water.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Donald, an atheist is someone who denies altogether the existence of a God. You are an agnostic. An agnostic is someone who believes that there can be no proof of the existence of God... but does not deny the possibility that God exists.

Goodbye, Dr. Thurman.
Goodbye, Dr. Thurman.
Goodbye, Donald.
Whoa, Elizabeth. A little hostile, there. Maybe you should be the one in therapy. Then Mom and Dad can pay someone two hundred dollars an hour to listen to all of your thoughts... so we won't have to.
Maybe you'd like to tell Mom and Dad why you stopped taking your medication.
It's called "The Philosophy of Time Travel".
What does time travel have to do with philosophy?

Guess who wrote it?
So I hear you have a girlfriend.
Yeah.

No I don't. She worries about you.

Well, don't worry... I'm taking my medication.
Well, don't worry... I'm taking my medication.
It's not that. I mean mouthing off to your teachers. I'll admit... when Dad told me what you said to Ms. Farmer, I laughed my ass off.

I was just being honest.

Her name is Gretchen.
Her name is Gretchen.
That's a nice name. OK, let me see it.
I got in. I'm going to Harvard.
Congratulations.
Mom and Dad won't be back until Sunday night. It's Halloween Carnival. We should throw a party. We could totally get away with it.
Okay, but it has to be a small one.
Okay, but it has to be a small one.
Everything is going to be just fine.
How much are they paying you to be here?
Excuse me? What's your name, son?
Excuse me? What's your name, son?
Gerald.
Gerald.
Well, Gerald, I think you're afraid.
Well, Gerald, I think you're afraid.
Well, Jim, I think you're full of shit!
I think you are afraid to ask me for advice. I think that you are a very troubled... confused young man. I think you're searching for answers in all the wrong places.
Well, I think you're the fucking Anti-Christ.
Thank you for seeing us... We... just felt that it was time to discuss...
What I think is going on with your son.
What I think is going on with your son.
Well, you know about his past. And when you said to look for signs of aggression... He was recently suspended from school for insulting his gym teacher.
Has your son ever told you about Frank?
Come again?

You're telling me my son has an imaginary friend?
You're telling me my son has an imaginary friend?
He has described lengthy conversations... physical encounters with what I believe to be a manifestation of his subconscious mind.
I... What can we do?
I would like to put him through more hypnotherapy... and increase his medication.
If that's what you think is necessary.
But let me remind you that this treatment is... experimental.
Our son just called me a bitch.
You're not a bitch.
So let me get this straight. No airline will claim ownership of the engine. So we have to wait for the FAA to decide who fixes my roof. Fuck that. We're taking the money out of savings.
You are entering a new dimension of sight and sound...
What?
Frankie Feedler. You remember him from high school?
Frankie Feedler. You remember him from high school?
He was a year ahead of us?
He was a year ahead of us?
He died, remember? On the way to the prom. He was doomed.
I haven't been accepted yet, mother.
If you think Michael Dukakis will provide for this country prior to the point when you decide to squeeze one out, then I think you're misinformed.
Excuse me?
Donnie? You're a dick.
Did you just call me a fuck-ass?
That's enough.
That's enough.
You can suck a fuck.
No. I took a year off to be with you. Of course I care. Don't get angry. What?
How did you know --
How did you know --
I didn't realise it was such a big deal.

I caught him flushing pills down the toilet. He knows you check the container.
Here are the keys to the Taurus. There's plenty of groceries in the fridge. And I left money on the kitchen table. And don't forget...
Don't worry, Mom. Just go, you'll miss your flight.
I got twelve classrooms full of water. All coming from a busted water main.
What else?
What else?
What else? Shit, Principal Cole, you ain't gonna believe what else.
Christ. Is that an axe?
Yep.
Yep.
How did this happen?
How did this happen?
I guess they made him do it.
Excuse me... but what is the real issue here? The PTA doesn't ban books from school.
The PTA is here to acknowledge that there is pornography in our school's curriculum.
Do you even know who Graham Greene is?
I think we've all seen "Bonanza".
Kitty, I don't know what to say. They've suspended him for two days. Ever since this jet fiasco, I honestly don't know what has gotten into him.
Rose, I'll tell you this because our daughters have been on dance team together for two years and I respect you as a WOMAN. But after witnessing your son's behaviour today, I have... significant doubts... Our paths through life must be righteous. I urge you to go home and look in the mirror and pray that your son does not succumb to the path
Rose.
Kitty...
Kitty...
Rose, we have a crisis. I am sure that you are aware of the horrible allegations against Jim Cunningham.

Yes, I saw the news. Something about a kiddie-porn dungeon.
Yes, I saw the news. Something about a kiddie-porn dungeon.
Please! Don't say those words. Well... as you can see... many of us are devastated by this news. This is obviously some kind of conspiracy meant to destroy an innocent man. And I have taken it upon myself to spearhead the Jim Cunningham defence campaign. But unfortunately my civic duties have created a conflict of interest... which involves you.

Beg pardon?
Beg pardon?
Rose... I have to appear at his arraignment tomorrow morning. And as you know, the girls also leave for Los Angeles tomorrow morning. Now, as their coach... I was the obvious choice to chaperone them on the trip.

But now you can't go.

Yes. And believe me, of all the other mothers I would never dream of asking you, given the predicament with your son. But none of the other mothers are able to go.

Oh, Kitty, I don't know. This is so last-minute... Eddie is in New York...
Oh, Kitty, I don't know. This is so last-minute... Eddie is in New York...
Rose... I don't know if you realise how great an opportunity this is for our daughters. This has been a dream of ours for a long time. Sometimes I doubt your commitment to Sparkle Motion.
Kitty, I would appreciate... if you could wait...
Mr. Cole... not only am I a TEACHER... but I am also a PARENT of a Middlesex child. Therefore, I am the ONLY person here who transcends the parent-teacher bridge.

Kitty...
The bottom line... Mr. Cole... is that there is material being taught to our children that is cause for this destructive behaviour.
And how do they do this? They FLOOD the house... by breaking through the water main!
This meeting of the PTA was called to inform the parents of our ongoing investigation...

I AM THE PTA! And I say that this FILTH is directly related to this vandalism.
Chut up!
Go back to China, bitch!
Maybe Martha Moo finally went nuts and hijacked the bus.
You know, there's, like, this rule. We get to go home at 7:55.
You know, there's, like, this rule. We get to go home at 7:55.
There's no rule!
There's no rule!
Fuck yeah there is! If the bus doesn't show up in thirty minutes, you're supposed to go straight home.
All right! 7:55. Everybody goes home.
Let's go to Donnie's house. His parents are both at work.

Smurfette doesn't fuck.

Not Vanity. He's a homo.
We got eggs, water balloons, and a dozen rolls of toilet paper.
I stole four beers from my dad.
Is Mom okay?
She's alive, sweetie.
She's alive, sweetie.
Where is she?!

She's right over there.
Mommmm! I'll be right behind you in the hearse!
Don't let that worry you, Annette!
You're what?!
I -- I'm quittin' the pageant.
I -- I'm quittin' the pageant.
I heard you, I was just tryin' to scare you into changin' your mind. Oh for Chrissakes, Amber, the woman clung to your tap shoes while flyin' through the air like a Goddamn lawn dart!
I heard you, I was just tryin' to scare you into changin' your mind. Oh for Chrissakes, Amber, the woman clung to your tap shoes while flyin' through the air like a Goddamn lawn dart!
Oh God, I'm dead...
So, what do I say?
Simple. Just say, "Mom, I know you sacrificed everything -- relationships, dreams -- your tummy, ass and thighs -- all to bring me into this world. All so I could have tap lessons and be in the pageant -- the same one you were in. But, y'know what? I'm quittin'." There. Easy as pie.

Hell-no, she ain't quittin'.

"Once a carnie, always a carnie."
Oh-yah.
That was your mom. She wanted you to have this.
Really, Loretta?

Well God-love-ya for thinkin' I still could.

Thank God for bunge cords.
Thank God for bunge cords.
...Yah -- well, at least, y'know, I got to perform. And Mom got to see me. I guess number eight only worked for Diane Sawyer...
What is wrong with you?
I don't know. I just didn't wanna win like this.
I don't know. I just didn't wanna win like this.
You stop right there. You are a good person. Good things happen to good people.

Okay.
Okay.
Do you guys want some shots? I'm buyin'.
I never liked her, but she didn't deserve to die in the belly of a swan like that. The whole thing's just kinda sad and lame at the same time.
This came for you, sweetie.
This came for you, sweetie.
Ah! It's from State! Oh my God!
It's all the stuff I get to do. Oh my God, oh my God... Okay, okay... We get a "personal consultation" with a make-up artist -- Eeeh! Okay, um, there'll be a choreographer to the stars and, oh no -- No way. Oh... My... God!

I gotta work with these women.
I gotta work with these women.
Okay, sweetie, that's all right. Let's go. Let's go.

I -- I -- I -- I -- I --, j-uh-j-uh- just wanted to compe-e-e-e-ete.
I can't believe this is happenin'. I can't believe she said you couldn't...
Amber? Here.
"Here," wh-wh-what?
"Here," wh-wh-what?
My jacket. Take it 'cause, y'know, I got my costume okay'd before the pageant. You can wear it.
Shut up, yous guys. Look, Amber, I'm not gonna win. And let's be honest, a family only needs one "Liza" and you know Peter's got much better legs than me.
Your parents'd kill you.
Your parents'd kill you.
Oh c'mon, I love 'em, but you know they only had me 'cause Peter needed a kidney.
Oh c'mon, I love 'em, but you know they only had me 'cause Peter needed a kidney.
Lis, I want to, I really do, but... Oh, I can't.
Lis, I want to, I really do, but... Oh, I can't.
Then do it for Peter. Mrs. Leeman used to call him a "skinny little fag" when he'd bag her groceries. He'd pop his Nancy-belt if his old jacket somehow, I don't know, got her back.

Oh-you-beccha.
I'm lucky I have an after-school job where I can practice my talent.
Oh, yeah, sure. You know, every pageant is special, but this one is extra-special to me. When I was seventeen, I don't know if you know this, but I was crowned Mount Rose's American Teen Princess. And this year... drum roll please, my lovely daughter, Rebecca Ann Leeman is competin'.
Mrs. Leeman?
Huh?
Huh?
I -- I'm wearin' this costume. I'm, uh, I'm gonna do my talent tonight.
I -- I'm wearin' this costume. I'm, uh, I'm gonna do my talent tonight.
Oh really -- I don't think so. Uh, Amber, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but rules state that a costume must be okay'd at least a week in advance. And this... This is why we have the rule. My goodness gracious, I couldn't allow a neckline this low on stage. We have kids in the audience.

Sorry. I just thought she might not wanna meet her Maker lookin' like a cheap whore.
Well, your "cheap whore" is this family's "lovin' mother." The Clemens said to make him look like he just came from snowmobilin'. Pink cheeks, and...

Hey, Amber, y'get my smokes?

Oh... How quickly they grow up. Hey, if they ask you to take off your shirt, get the money first.
Oh, Mom, it's so ugly.
Ruined a brand-new pair of Lee Press- ons. Well, I sat down for a beer and KA- BLEWEY! Next thing I know, somethin' blows through my kitchen window. Next thing I know, I'm ass up in Loretta's flower bed.
Go on! Get out!
Mom, look, don't say anything. First of all, I'm not pregnant.
Mom!
I ain't lettin' go ktil you tell me what's up. I'm reaching' a point where I'd kill someone for the nicotine on their fingernails.

Oh, c'mon... First the picture of Tammy, then Brett Clemens, now this? It's scary.
Let me tell you "scary," Amber. Look at me. Do you wanna look like you been rode hard and put away wet at my age? I'm a "lifer" here. Best I can hope for is to end up in a descent "raisin ranch" where they'll change me twice a day.

He's-a very easy to insult -- I say something to his niece once, and he slapped my face.
Why didn't his niece slap your face?
Why didn't his niece slap your face?
She did.
She did.
What did you say to her?
You're lucky I don't slap your face -- you oughtta be ashamed of yourself. Where did you hear that story?
You told it to me.
You told it to me.
Oh, yes, I remember -- and I should have slapped Mrs. Teasdale's face when she told it to me... I'm going right out and find Trentino. You go right out and get yourself an army.
Wait a minute. What kind of an army do you think we oughtta have?
I think we oughtta have a standing army, so we can save money on chairs.
Send in the next girl.
By the way, are you sure we need a spy?
By the way, are you sure we need a spy?
Sure, we gotta have a spy. If we no got a spy who's gonna tell the other side what we're doing?
I'm glad I didn't ask you for "Washington Crossing the Delaware".
We've gotta have somebody who knows how to get secrets from men. You know how to make love?
He's going to make a good spy... that's not bad for the first day.
That's not bad for any day.
You're right about that guy -- I think we've got something.
I don't know about us, but I know he's-a got something...
You no gotta no gun.
Who said I had a gun... Gimme those plans, you paper snatchers --
Late again, eh? You haven't been on time once since this war started... Get out there and fight...
I can't do it...
I can't do it...
Why not? You're the Secretary of War, aren't you?
Why not? You're the Secretary of War, aren't you?
Yes, but I'm not working for you any more. I'm on the other side.
Yes, but I'm not working for you any more. I'm on the other side.
Is that so? I used to think you were two-faced - but you can't be - or you wouldn't be wearing that one. Now - let's talk this thing over.
Now -- how many men you got in your army?
Well, we gotta one hundred thousand men.
Well, we gotta one hundred thousand men.
That's not fair -- we've only got fifty thousand.

That's all right. We let you have twenty-five thousand men -- and we both start even.

That's the spirit -- fifty-fifty.

No. Seventy-five -- seventy-five.

Well, we'll let that one go. Now -- how many battalions you got?

We gotta two battalions and one Frenchman.

I wish you were still working for me, so I could ask you to resign. How're ya fixed for cavalry?

I've gotta five thousand men but no horses.

That's funny, we've got five thousand horses but no men.
That's funny, we've got five thousand horses but no men.
That's all right -- our men can ride your horses.
That's all right -- our men can ride your horses.
Not a bad idea. If our horses get tired they can ride your men for a change. Now, I don't mind letting you have our horses, but you must promise to put them through their maneuvers.
Not a bad idea. If our horses get tired they can ride your men for a change. Now, I don't mind letting you have our horses, but you must promise to put them through their maneuvers.
Oh, sure. We have horse maneuvers every morning.
With a gun like that you can kill some of your own men.
That's-a pretty good. I'll take a dozen of them.
That's-a pretty good. I'll take a dozen of them.
Anything else?
Anything else?
Yes, one gross of bullets, two dozen hand-grenades, three kegs of powder -- and throw in some matches.
Yes, one gross of bullets, two dozen hand-grenades, three kegs of powder -- and throw in some matches.
Fine. We'll throw in the matches before we make the delivery. By the way, how're you fixed for spys?

Fine. We gotta him.
Fine. We gotta him.
So! -- He's on your side, too.
So! -- He's on your side, too.
Sure.
Sure.
Well, with you two fellows on the other side, this country should have no trouble keeping the wolf from the door.
How'm I doing, boss?
Fine - keep on yelling - Do everything you can to disturb Firefly - Now what about your cousin?

Your Excellency, please don't think me silly, but I'd love to have a picture of you. I want to hang it in my bedroom.
You couldn't hang me in your bedroom -- I'll make a note of it. Where's my secretary?
You keep that up and you'll crab the whole war.
Carry out this tragic folly if you will -- But I for one will not be a part of it. I will stay here in Freedonia.
Oh, Your Excellency, isn't there something I can do?
Yes, but I'll talk to you about that when we're alone...

What'll I do with this card?
You can keep it -- I've got a whole pack... Now what were you saying?
In choosing you, I feel that I serve my country well. I heartily endorse everything you stand for.
Well, I won't stand for much. And I won't stand for you if you don't show some improvement soon. Look at your report card last month -- "D" in spelling... six in behavior. Now who were the six? A fine state of affairs -- no wonder you can't matriculate, now what were you saying?

Your Excellency!
Your Excellency!
You're not so bad yourself, Mrs. Teasdale, when I look at you I can see that we're facing a crisis. We've got to balance the budget -- we've got to cut down everything including, you.
Your Excellency, the eyes of the world are upon you. Notables from every land are gathered here in your honor -- This is a gala day for us.
Well, a gal a day is enough for me. I couldn't handle any more.

I wouldn't know what to say either if I was in your place. Maybe you can suggest something.
So -- you've come to ask for clemency! I'll give the enemy no quarter -- not a dime...
But Your Excellency -- the Ambassador is here on a friendly visit... He came to ask you to patch up the breach.

Let him patch up his own breeches...
Oh, won't you reconsider...
Well, maybe I am a little headstrong... But, you know, it's awfully hard to forget what he called me.
Guard them with your life... don't leave them out of your sight... If the enemy gets those papers we're lost. If they don't get them, we're lost. Can't you see what I'm trying to tell you? I love you... Mrs. Teasdale, you're the salt of the earth. They don't come any better than you...
Now -- er --
Now -- er --
Well -- they might come better but they don't come any bigger... and the bigger the better. The bigger the betta you've got on a horse, the more you lose, and speaking about horses, why don't you marry me. Come, come -- say yes and you'll never see me again. I'll go 'way if it means your happiness...

Gloria -- may I call you Gloria?
Why -- why -- of course.
Why -- why -- of course.
You can call me Gloria too. Gloria -- what a beautiful name. When I was born my mother named me Gloria -- two minutes later she found out her mistake...
I hope I'm not interrupting.

Your Excellency, something terrible has just happened.

That's all right. I'll fix you right up.
My purse has been stolen -- the plans of war are in it.
WHAT ?

Don't bother me - I'm thinking -- What was that?

But -

You satisfied your selfish whims, while nations tottered, dynasties rocked and the world plunged headlong into a chasm of chaos and oblivion -- Not bad, eh?
You know I think they think I should be king. Although it would please me to govern the throng, suppose I were king and then everything went wrong.
The king can do no wrong!
Your uncle has been such a friend to us in every crisis. Without his country's financial aid --
What is money? Mrs. Teasdale, for you -- I would do anything.

Gentlemen! Gentlemen!
I didn't come here to be insulted.
I shall report this indignity the my President. Mrs. Teasdale, I feel this regrettable occurrence will plunge our countries into war.
This is terrible!
Mrs. Teasdale, I'm willing to pocket my pride and do anything I can to make up with his Excellency.
Oh, would you...?
Oh, would you...?
For you, I would do anything...
So that's the one you want to marry.

That's where you come in. I'll leave him in your hands, and don't forget you're supposed to be my niece.
Uncle, you can't do this!
My dear niece -- I must ask you not to interfere. War is not a woman's problem.
My dear niece -- I must ask you not to interfere. War is not a woman's problem.
It is every woman's problem. Who supplies the sons? -- the brothers? -- the husbands? Who...
This is all Firefly's fault -- that idiot, that fool...
I thought everything was working out fine.

Fine nothing! I didn't want war... My plan was to marry Mrs. Teasdale and overthrow Firefly.

If only we can get his Excellency to listen to reason...
Perhaps he will listen to you...
Mr. Merrick, sugar?
Yes please, two.
Yes please, two.
One or two?
One or two?
Two, please.
Oh yes. You have so many nice things, and so much room.
Oh?
And here is one of Frederick's mother.
How lovely.
They have noble faces.
I've always thought that myself.
I've always thought that myself.
Oh, yes.
Oh... why Mr. Merrick she's beautiful.
She has the face of an angel... She was an angel. She was so kind... so kind to me. It's not her fault, for in the fourth month of her maternal condition she was knocked down by an elephant. I'm sure I must have been a great disappointment to her.

Oh no, Mr. Merrick. No. No son as loving as you are could ever be a disappointment.
Oh no, Mr. Merrick. No. No son as loving as you are could ever be a disappointment.
If only I could find her. If only she could see me now, here, with such lovely kind friends. You, Mrs. Treves, and you, Mr. Treves. Then maybe she would love me as I am. I've tried to hard to be good.
You won't be long?
I'll join you shortly.
Did it go well, darling?
Yes, very well, I think. Are the girls in bed?
Yes, very well, I think. Are the girls in bed?
Yes, and they send their kisses. Would you like your sherry now?
Yes, and they send their kisses. Would you like your sherry now?
No, I think a whiskey.
Freddie?... Freddie, don't look so discouraged.
I shouldn't be. We made great progress today. I taught him to repeat a few basic phrases. He did rather well, too, but I had to lead him every step of the way. Though frankly, at times I was unsure of who was leading whom.

Well, I wasn't sure whether he was parroting me because that's all he was capable of, or whether he sensed that that's all I wanted to hear, and he was trying to please me.

But I thought you said that he was rather... simple?
He is. I mean, I've always thought he was. I think he must be. Is he simple? Or is that just something I've wished upon him to make things simpler for myself?
Frederick, why are you so interested in this particular case?
I don't know. I can't explain it. If this is an intelligent man, trapped in the body of a monster, then I'm under a moral obligation to help free that mind, free that spirit as best I can, to help him live as full and content a life as possible. But! If he's an imbecile, who's body I can't treat and who's mind I
Perhaps you're just polishing a stone, endowing this Elephant Man with qualities he doesn't possess?
And what qualities are those? Intelligence or stupidity?
And what qualities are those? Intelligence or stupidity?
I'm sure I don't know, Freddie.
I'm sorry... I don't know either. I just don't know.
Well, these things take time.
Well, these things take time.
I've only got until two o'clock tomorrow afternoon, when Carr Gomm meets him. Somehow, between now and then I've got to make John Merrick at least seem like an intelligent man... Why am I fooling myself? Nothing short of John delivering the Sermon on the Mount is going to sway Carr Gomm...
John loves the house.
Do you?
Yes.
And here are my mother and father.
You stay with me.
Dinner will be served, shortly, dear.
More romances for John?
Hmmm?
Hmmm?
...Freddie! What's the matter? You've been like this all evening.
...Freddie! What's the matter? You've been like this all evening.
Oh... I've just been thinking about something that man Bytes said.

Oh, Freddie. What could that wretched vampire say to upset you?
Oh, Freddie. What could that wretched vampire say to upset you?
That I am very little different from him.
That I am very little different from him.
Oh that's absurd, Frederick. No, no Frederick, that's all wrong! John is happier and more fulfilled now than he has ever been in his entire life. And, that is completely due to you.
Oh that's absurd, Frederick. No, no Frederick, that's all wrong! John is happier and more fulfilled now than he has ever been in his entire life. And, that is completely due to you.
But why did I do it? What was this all for? So John Merrick could live out his last days in peace and comfort? Or so I could become famous?
But why did I do it? What was this all for? So John Merrick could live out his last days in peace and comfort? Or so I could become famous?
Frederick, just what is it that you are saying?
Frederick, just what is it that you are saying?
...Am I a good man or am I a bad man?
...Am I a good man or am I a bad man?
Oh Frederick.
Excuse me, Mr. Treves, sir.
Yes?
Yes?
I found it.
I found it.
Did you see it?
Our man is sick. Come right away.
What is it?
What is it?
Like this.
Like this.
I'll get my bag.
You sly bastard. You're doing this to spite me, aren't you!
Aw, Bytes, he's sick.
Aw, Bytes, he's sick.
He's doing it to spite me, I tell you, and it's got to stop!
He's doing it to spite me, I tell you, and it's got to stop!
He's sick, Bytes. He's going to die.
He's sick, Bytes. He's going to die.
If he does it's his own fault! But I'm not burying that swollen bag of flesh.
What are you going to do?
I'll show you! I'll show you!
Don't!
Shut up!
What did you do to him? He's been like this all night!
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
He was fine when he left here, and now look at him.
He was fine when he left here, and now look at him.
I intend to.
What happened?
He fell. He falls.
He fell. He falls.
He must have taken quite a fall.
He's a clumsy git. Never watches where he is going.
Why is he sitting up like this? He needs rest.
Why is he sitting up like this? He needs rest.
That's the way he sleeps. If he lays down, he'll die. Head's too heavy.
This man belongs in hospital.
Can't you fix him up here? ...He's my livelihood. Listen.
Can't you fix him up here? ...He's my livelihood. Listen.
You listen, you're not going to have much of a livelihood if this man dies. He's got the rale, he's very weak, and I don't know how much damage has been done by his "fall". Now stop wasting time and fetch a cab.
I like doing business with you. You and I understand each other, completely. I know I can trust you. Can't I?
Everything will be seen to.
I want my man back.
Just a moment, how did you get in here?
Just a moment, how did you get in here?
Never mind that, I want my man!
Never mind that, I want my man!
He's still very sick. Please come downstairs with me. I'll explain the situation.
He's still very sick. Please come downstairs with me. I'll explain the situation.
DON'T... Don't muck me about. You've had plenty of time to fix him up, and he's leaving with me, NOW. Do you understand me? Now, Mr. Treves. We had a bargain!
DON'T... Don't muck me about. You've had plenty of time to fix him up, and he's leaving with me, NOW. Do you understand me? Now, Mr. Treves. We had a bargain!
You misunderstood. This man suffered a severe fall, if you take my meaning. He's my patient now and I must do what...

Pull the other one, why don't you! We made a deal!

I know what you've done to him and he's never going back to that.
I know what you've done to him and he's never going back to that.
He's a freak! That's how they live. We're partners, him and I, business partners. You're willfully deprivin' me of my livlihood!

All you do is profit from another man's misery!
All you do is profit from another man's misery!
You think you're better 'n me? YOU wanted the freak to show all your doctor chums and make a name for yourself, you guv. So I gave him to you. On trust, in the name of science! And now I want him back.

You don't own this man!

So you can beat him? So you can starve him? A dog in the street would fare better with you!
So you can beat him? So you can starve him? A dog in the street would fare better with you!
I've got my rights, damn you, and I'm going to the authorities!
Now I think we really do understand one another.
Right... Right.
Good morning, Treves.
Good morning, sir.
Good morning, sir.
You've acquired a taste for this?
You've acquired a taste for this?
It's quite nutritious, sir.
It's quite nutritious, sir.
Don't be mad. This muck can kill you.
Don't be frightened. He won't hurt you.
Indeed!
A hospital is no place for secrecy, Mr. Treves. Doctors spiriting hooded figures about are liable to cause comment. Why wasn't this patient properly admitted, and why is he in isolation? Is he contagious?
No sir, he's got bronchitis and he's been badly beaten.
No sir, he's got bronchitis and he's been badly beaten.
Why isn't he in the General Ward, then?
Why isn't he in the General Ward, then?
Well sir, he's quite seriously deformed, and I fear the other patients would find him... rather shocking.
Well sir, he's quite seriously deformed, and I fear the other patients would find him... rather shocking.
Deformed? Is that it. Then am I to assume that he is ultimately incurable?
Deformed? Is that it. Then am I to assume that he is ultimately incurable?
Yes sir.
Yes sir.
What are your plans then, Treves... You are aware that the London does not accept incurables. The rules are quite clear on that point.
What are your plans then, Treves... You are aware that the London does not accept incurables. The rules are quite clear on that point.
Yes, I'm well aware of that. But this case is quite exceptional.
Yes, I'm well aware of that. But this case is quite exceptional.
Oh, is he a friend of yours?
Oh, is he a friend of yours?
No, more of an acquaintance.
I certainly sympathize with your problem, Treves... Why don't you try the British Home, or the Royal Hospital for perhaps they would have a place for him.
Yes sir, I'll look into that. Would you like to meet him sir?
Have you contacted the British Home and the Royal Hospital?
Ah, no sir. I had planned to see them in the morning.
Ah, no sir. I had planned to see them in the morning.
Good! How is the patient?
Good! How is the patient?
He's doing very well. In fact that's why I came to see you. I think that if I were to present Mr. Merrick to the hospital committee, then they would have a chance to see for themselves not only the extraordinary nature of the disease, but of the man as well. If the committee had a chance to speak with him, hear him say

A few words? I thought he was imbecile?
A few words? I thought he was imbecile?
Well sir, perhaps I should explain...
Well sir, perhaps I should explain...
I really don't think that's necessary Treves. I'm quite sure the committee will be able to make an equitable decision on the merits of the case, such as they are.
I really don't think that's necessary Treves. I'm quite sure the committee will be able to make an equitable decision on the merits of the case, such as they are.
I don't agree. No one can make a reasonable decision about this man's future without at least meeting him. No doctor would presume to diagnose a patient he had never met.
I don't agree. No one can make a reasonable decision about this man's future without at least meeting him. No doctor would presume to diagnose a patient he had never met.
No, Treves, it's out of the question. Now if it was up to me, I'd say "Certainly, let's meet the fellow, by all means," I'm sorry, I simply can't speak for the other members of the committee.
No, Treves, it's out of the question. Now if it was up to me, I'd say "Certainly, let's meet the fellow, by all means," I'm sorry, I simply can't speak for the other members of the committee.
Then will you meet him, as a representative of the committee.
Then will you meet him, as a representative of the committee.
Mr. Treves, it's out of the question. I want to hear as soon as possible what the other hospitals can do. I'm sorry.
Singularly unpleasant chap... uh... I don't suppose there would be any harm in my meeting your... patient, Mr. Treves.
Thank you very much Sir. Shall we say in a few days then?
Thank you very much Sir. Shall we say in a few days then?
Shall we say two o'clock tomorrow afternoon?
Shall we say two o'clock tomorrow afternoon?
Wh... whatever is most convenient for you, sir.
Wh... whatever is most convenient for you, sir.
Two o'clock then... you know Treves... It seems this acquaintance of yours has become rather more than just an acquaintance.
Two o'clock then... you know Treves... It seems this acquaintance of yours has become rather more than just an acquaintance.
...Yes, Sir.
It's only a physical problem. He has trouble with certain sounds because of the constrictive deformity of the mouth. But he can talk, and has a great eagerness to make contact with people who will let him. So if you have any difficulty understanding what he is saying, just tell me and I'll make it clear.
Speaking is one thing, Treves, but can the man comprehend?
...As I said, it's only a physical problem... but I do feel that Mr. Merrick is very flattered that you're taking the time and trouble to meet him, and he's most anxious to make a good impression, so he might seem rather nervous.
He needn't. I have no desire to cause him any discomfort. Did you make those inquiries we spoke about?
He needn't. I have no desire to cause him any discomfort. Did you make those inquiries we spoke about?
Yes, I spoke to both the British Home and Royal Hospital for Incurables. I'm afraid that they weren't very encouraging, but they said they'd bring it up at their next committee meeting, so we should have their answers shortly.

Fine, fine. You know, your dedication to this patient is an inspiring thing, Treves. But you must remember that this is a hospital, and there are many patients here. Patients who can be made well, and you owe them your first consideration. Just don't become so obsessed, old man, that you begin to neglect them.
Oh yes?
And what was that, John?
It was a nice try, Treves, but the man is so obviously mouthing your words.
Yes, I'm very sorry to have wasted your time, sir. I just felt that I had to do anything I could to protect him.
Yes, I'm very sorry to have wasted your time, sir. I just felt that I had to do anything I could to protect him.
I'm sorry too. He simply doesn't belong here. He's be much happier somewhere else, where he could be constantly looked after. Believe me, Frederick, it's better that it worked out this way. Good day.
How did you, know the rest? I never taught you the rest of it.
I don't understand.
I don't understand.
Tell me, John, how did you know the rest of the 23rd Psalm?
Treves. Well done.
Not me, sir. Mr. Merrick. He succeeded in spite of my shortsightedness.
Can you imagine what his life has been like?
Yes, I think I can.
Yes, I think I can.
No you can't. You can't begin to know, no one can.
You are quite right, Treves, this is an exceptional case. And I quite agree that the committee should see Mr. Merrick.
I could easily arrange...
I could easily arrange...
No, not that way. Broadneck and the others don't like to deal with patients directly. It makes them queasy... Do you have any photographs of Mr. Merrick?
No, not that way. Broadneck and the others don't like to deal with patients directly. It makes them queasy... Do you have any photographs of Mr. Merrick?
Well, yes.
Well, yes.
Excellent. We shall present them, along with the other particulars of the case to the committee. I want them to see, exactly, how horribly his body has been affected. You and I shall vouch for his inner qualities.

Do you think they'll go along with us?
Do you think they'll go along with us?
Of course they will. They're reasonable men.
Don't we?
No, we don't. Their committees have informed me that they're unwilling to take Mr. Merrick, even if they were supplied with funds. They don't want him.
No, we don't. Their committees have informed me that they're unwilling to take Mr. Merrick, even if they were supplied with funds. They don't want him.
Well, it's up to us then, isn't it?
Has the response picked up?
Frankly, Treves, it's not what I'd expected. A few small cheques. Well- wishers. Don't worry, these things undoubtedly take time.

But he's so afraid he's going to be carted off. I've promised him that won't happen.

Well... I'll let you know if there's something in the afternoon post.
Well... I'll let you know if there's something in the afternoon post.
Please do.
Don't you think this is a bit premature? We don't have the backing yet to...
Steady on, Treves. Have a seat.
How are you feeling today?
I feel much better. Thank you for asking. And you?
I feel much better. Thank you for asking. And you?
I'm feeling very fit, thank you. How is your bronchitis?

Are you comfortable here?

Everyone has been very kind. I am extremely grateful.
...I... everyone has been very kind to me.
Of course. How long did you and Mr. Treves prepare for this interview?
...everyone has been very kind.
Yes, of course... Well, it's been a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Merrick. Good day.
What is it, Treves?
Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies, Thou anointest my head with oil...
It was a great pleasure to meet you, Mr. Merrick.
I am very pleased to meet you.
I am very pleased to meet you.
I hope we can talk together again sometime. Good day.
How long has this man been here?
Three quarters of an hour.
Three quarters of an hour.
Mmmm. Hodges, Pierce come closer. Mr. Hill, take hold of the rope please. It's a machine accident. I expect you'll be seeing a good deal of this.
Abominable things these machines. One can't reason with them.
What a mess.
I say Freddie, what are you about?
Oh nothing... nothing of any great importance.
Good Lord, Freddie! What have you got in there?
You'll know presently. At the meeting of the society. But until then, I beg of you Fox, keep it to yourself.

Nothing of any importance, eh?
You never mentioned his mental state.
He's imbecile, no doubt from birth. He speaks, but... it's all gibberish. No, the man's a homeless idiot... I pray God he's an idiot.

Good day...!
I've brought you some things. I hope you'll like, Mr. Merrick. I hope you don't think it too forward.
I've brought you some things. I hope you'll like, Mr. Merrick. I hope you don't think it too forward.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
I knew you'd understand. Here.
I want you to know that I don't go about giving my pictures to just anyone.
Oh, no. I would never think it! It's so beautiful. You are so... I'll give it a place of honor, here, next to my mother.
She's very pretty, your mother.
Yes.
Mr. Treves says that you are in the theatre. Do you live there?
Oh no, Mr. Merrick. I just work there.

Well, even to work there would be wonderful. Is it beautiful?

It's very difficult to put into a nutshell, but I should say the theater is the shrine of the imagination, where one may suspend disbelief and travel anywhere in the world, to any time you desire. You may look over the shoulders of kings, unobserved, battle with ruthless tyrants, and marry the beautiful princess, all in the space of a few hours. Onstage you

That's one thing the theatre has in great store. which reminds me. I have something else for you...
Have you read it?
No, but I certainly shall.
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do. They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
Why, Mr. Merrick, you're not an Elephant Man at all...
Oh no?
Oh no?
Oh no... no... you're a Romeo.
John, I'd like you to meet one of the brightest lights of the British stage, Mrs. Kendal. Mrs. Kendal, John Merrick.
Good day, Mr. Merrick.
It's all arranged. I'll send over some evening gowns for the sisters that you select to accompany Mr. Merrick. You'll be using the Royal entrance and Princess Alexandra herself will be there to welcome him to her private box.
I'm very grateful to you, Mrs. Kendal. This is just the thing to help him forget his ordeal. John will be very excited.
I'm very grateful to you, Mrs. Kendal. This is just the thing to help him forget his ordeal. John will be very excited.
Well it is a miracle he ever got back. And, I'm sure, Mr. Treves, under your expert care, he'll have many happy years ahead.

I fear not, Mrs. Kendal. Even in the short time he was gone the size of his head has increased rapidly... as is his pain.

Yes. There is nothing more frustrating, nothing that makes a physician feel more useless, than standing by watching his patient deteriorate. And when that patient is a friend, no... no, there's absolutely nothing I can do.

Oh yes! It is much better than what I am used to.
...Yes potatoes... but...
But the variety of food here is very pleasing... I commend you.
Why did you let me go on like that, teaching you what you already knew? Why didn't you tell me you could read?
You did not ask me.
You did not ask me.
I never thought to ask. How can you ever forgive me?
I never thought to ask. How can you ever forgive me?
Oh, no do not say that. You have been so kind to me. I was afraid to say too much. People always want me to be quiet. You wanted me to speak, but I was afraid. Forgive me.

Of course! What did you think?
How long will I stay here?
I promise you. You will never see the inside of that horrible place again. You will never, ever go back to the workhouse... or that man. It's a splendid room, don't you think?
You look splendid, John.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
When one is invited to tea, one must look one's best.
John... what's the matter? John... why are you upset?
I'm not used to such kindness. From a beautiful woman.
Well, it's a lovely bedroom. What do you call that thing above the bed?
That's a canopy, John.

Ohhh...

How is your tea, John?

John, there's someone here who would like to meet you. Would that be alright?
When will the stream be aweary of flowing under my eye? When will the wind be aweary of blowing over the sky? When will the clouds be aweary of fleeting? When will the heart be aweary of beating, and nature die?
Never, oh! Never, nothing will die. the stream flows the wind blows the heart beats Nothing will die.
Mr. Treves, there is something I've been meaning to ask you for some time...
Yes, John?
Yes, John?
...Can you cure me?
No John, I can't. I can care for you, but I can't cure you.
I thought as much.
The cathedral is coming along nicely.
Yes, soon I will start the main spire, but I must finish these columns first, How kind of her!
How blind of me. Is there anything else, John, anything at all that I could get for you?
Oh no! There is nothing! I have everything, you have given me everything I could possibly want. I am happy every hour of the day. I only wish there was something I could give to you.
Oh no! There is nothing! I have everything, you have given me everything I could possibly want. I am happy every hour of the day. I only wish there was something I could give to you.
Please John, it would give me so much pleasure to give you something. Something just for yourself. Isn't there something you would like to have?
You want a dressing bag, John?
You don't think it's too gaudy, do you?
...my... home?
Yes, John.
Yes, John.
You did this for me?
You did this for me?
Yes.

Is it the one you wanted?

Stand up, John. Let them see you.
Oh no, I couldn't.
Oh no, I couldn't.
It's for you, John. It's all for you. Go ahead, let them see you.
Will the cathedral be finished soon, John?
Yes, very soon.
Yes, very soon.
Splendid. it's truly a masterpiece. Well, I suppose I'll be on my way now. I hoped your enjoyed yourself this evening.
Splendid. it's truly a masterpiece. Well, I suppose I'll be on my way now. I hoped your enjoyed yourself this evening.
Oh yes! It was wonderful!
Oh yes! It was wonderful!
I'm glad, John. Goodnight.
Yes John?
Mr. Treves, tell me... tell me truly. Is it alright, did I make any mistakes that you can see?
Mr. Treves, tell me... tell me truly. Is it alright, did I make any mistakes that you can see?
No, John, not one that I can see.
No, John, not one that I can see.
Then I shouldn't change anything?
Then I shouldn't change anything?
No, no, I wouldn't change a thing.
Goodnight John. Sleep well.
You too, my friend. Goodnight.
Ah, Mothershead. How are you feeling today?
Fine.
Fine.
Good. Excellent. Now then, Mrs. Mothershead, I want you to come into this room with me. Inside there is a man with a rather... unfortunate appearance.
Good. Excellent. Now then, Mrs. Mothershead, I want you to come into this room with me. Inside there is a man with a rather... unfortunate appearance.
I've heard.
I've heard.
Yes... Well, I want you to clear up a little mess, a breakfast tray was spilt. And bring up another breakfast. When you've done that, you and I shall give the man a bath. But, Mothershead, I'm counting on your many years of experience to get you through this, Above all, do not scream, do not cry out, or in any way show this

Sir, you don't have to worry about me. I'm not the sort to cry out. Shall we go in?
Sir, you don't have to worry about me. I'm not the sort to cry out. Shall we go in?
Yes... Yes, let's go in.
The workhouse.
Yes! The workhouse!
Good morning, Mr. Treves. It'll be his bath-time soon. Has he eaten?
Not quite yet, Mrs. Mothershead. There seems to be some difficulty this morning.
Won't come out, eh?
No, he's very upset about something.
No, he's very upset about something.
Just being obstinate, sir. I'll handle it.
He's had his share of "smacks", Mothershead. I expect that's what drives him under the bed. We must use patience and understanding with this man.
Perhaps you've got the time for that, Mr. Treves, I certainly don't. I've got an entire hospital to look after, and you have your real patients. Don't waste your time with him sir, it's like talking to a wall. I don't mean to be harsh, but truthfully what can you do for him? I'll be back later for his bath. And Mr. Carr Gomm
Good Lord, Mr. Treves!
We've made tremendous strides today, Mothershead. He listens and repeats with great attention, and this certainly isn't easy for him.

Parrots can do as much, Mr. Treves. It's all very nice, but I don't see the point. You know they won't let him stay here.
Parrots can do as much, Mr. Treves. It's all very nice, but I don't see the point. You know they won't let him stay here.
I'm sure that if Mr. Merrick made a good impression on the hospital committee they'd see that he's the exception to their rule. Now I'm not expecting miracles. I'm not saying he'll be able to read or write, but I do think that I can get him to speak for himself. I'm going to arrange things with Carr Gomm right now. That was very
Watery headed bunch.
I regret that I must leave you here, m' Lord, m' Lady. Thank you so much for coming. It was an act of the greatest charity.
Incredible, isn't it? Well, I think John has had enough visitors for one day, Mothershead. I've got a lecture at the college, I'll be back this evening.
Excuse me, sir. I'd like to have a word with you.
Excuse me, sir. I'd like to have a word with you.
Oh?... Well, quickly please, Mothershead, I'm overdue.
Oh?... Well, quickly please, Mothershead, I'm overdue.
I can't understand why you let those people go in there, sir.
I can't understand why you let those people go in there, sir.
Now Mothershead, you have to understand that this is very good for John. He relishes contact with people outside the hospital...
Now Mothershead, you have to understand that this is very good for John. He relishes contact with people outside the hospital...
But you saw them, sir. They couldn't hide their disgust. They don't care anything for John, they're just trying to impress their friends.
But you saw them, sir. They couldn't hide their disgust. They don't care anything for John, they're just trying to impress their friends.
Aren't you being just a little harsh, Mothershead? You yourself hardly treated John with much loving kindness when he first arrived.
Aren't you being just a little harsh, Mothershead? You yourself hardly treated John with much loving kindness when he first arrived.
I bathed him, didn't I? I fed him and cleaned up after him! If loving kindness can be called care and practical concern, then yes, I did treat him with loving kindness, and I'm not ashamed to say it.
I bathed him, didn't I? I fed him and cleaned up after him! If loving kindness can be called care and practical concern, then yes, I did treat him with loving kindness, and I'm not ashamed to say it.
You're right, Mothershead, please forgive me... Of course, I appreciate everything you've done for John, and I'm glad that you are concerned about his welfare. But, I'm the physician in charge and I must do what I think best. I'm also very late, so please forgive me.
Mr. Treves, some more books arrived for Mr. Merrick.
Thank you, Mothershead. Have a porter put them in my office.
Thank you, Mothershead. Have a porter put them in my office.
Yes sir. What's that?
Yes sir. What's that?
A dressing bag.
A dressing bag.
Very smart indeed.

Yes. John wants it.

A dressing bag?

You don't think it's too gaudy, do you.
You don't think it's too gaudy, do you.
Well...
Well...
John thinks it's very dashing. Something no gentleman should be without. I'm inclined to agree.
So you see, John, there's no need for a lighthouse. All your friends are here.
Welcome home, John.
WHERE IS MR. MERRICK?
I... I don't know what you mean, Sir.
Don't lie to me. I know all about it. You were SEEN. Where did you take him?
Take him? Now wait... I didn't take him anywhere. We were just having some fun. We didn't hurt him... just having a laugh, that's all.
Take him? Now wait... I didn't take him anywhere. We were just having some fun. We didn't hurt him... just having a laugh, that's all.
HE'S GONE!
HE'S GONE!
When I left him, he was in his bed, safe and sound.

YOU BASTARD! You tortured him. YOU TORTURED HIM, you bastard. WHERE is HE?
YOU BASTARD! You tortured him. YOU TORTURED HIM, you bastard. WHERE is HE?
YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME! I ain't done nothing wrong. People pay to see your monster, Mr. Treves. I just take the money.
YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME! I ain't done nothing wrong. People pay to see your monster, Mr. Treves. I just take the money.
YOU'RE THE MONSTER! YOU'RE THE FREAK! GET OUT! YOU'RE FINISHED!
Are you the proprietor?
And who might you be, sir?
And who might you be, sir?
Just one of the curious. I'd like to see it.
Just one of the curious. I'd like to see it.
I don't think so. No sir, we're closed.
I'd pay handsomely for a private showing. Are you the proprietor?
Handsomely?... Who sent you?
Handsomely?... Who sent you?
Pardon me?
Pardon me?
Never mind. I'm the owner.
So you'll bring him to me, tomorrow, 10:00 a.m.? Mr...?
Bytes. Mr. Bytes. He'll be there.
Bytes. Mr. Bytes. He'll be there.
I'll send a cab. Here is my card.
Open up! I know you're in there!
Ah! It's my father!
Ah! It's my father!
Open up! I know you're in there!
Right! Where is he?
Who, Father?
Who, Father?
Who? Who? Whoever you've got in here of course!
Who? Who? Whoever you've got in here of course!
There IS no one.
Well... where is he?
There's nobody here, Father. Look for yourself.
Ah! So you admit there IS someone!
You're losing your temper!
It's all in your own mind, Father... It's YOU who imagine that I'm always up here with some man or other....
I don't know how you do it, Aud... I sometimes think you've got some of your mother's magic...
There is no magic, Father... My mother had no magic...
She did, I tell you! She could blind me as easily as the night the day.
She did, I tell you! She could blind me as easily as the night the day.
It's your fantasy...
It's your fantasy...
But one day I'll catch you... Like I caught her...
It's all right! It isn't happening!
But, Father, it IS!
It's sinking! Hy-Brasil is sinking!
Well, my dear, I think you'll find it's all a question of what you want to believe in.... I have slightly more experience of these matters than you...
WHAT did you say?
I said welcome.
I said welcome.
WELCOME?
WELCOME?
Well, of course. We always welcome friends.
How d'you KNOW we're "friends"?
Well, EVERYONE is friends here on Hy- Brasil.
Please! Please! What are those?
What are what?
What are what?
Those things in your hands.
Those things in your hands.
These? What are THESE? They're swords.
What's the matter?
PLEASE! You don't know what you're doing!
PLEASE! You don't know what you're doing!
What?
What?
Put them down! PLEASE make them put them down.
WHY?
Yes.
Yes.
But surely you know...?
Have you ever felt like this about anyone else?
What... you mean "got into bed with" them?
What... you mean "got into bed with" them?
No, of course not, silly -- I mean FELT like this about them?

You mean... you HAVE got into bed with somebody else?

It was different...

What was she like?

Oh... oh, I didn't know her very well...

But you LOVED her all the same...

We never went to bed together.

The Cloak Invisible. It was my mother's parting gift.
"The fifth one this week"!
"The fifth one this week"!
Oh, for goodness' sake!
Oh, for goodness' sake!
And I thought you said it was something special...
That's just what I was trying to tell you. You ARE...
Five this week; how many the week before?
Five this week; how many the week before?
You're as bad as my father.
You're as bad as my father.
And the week before that?
We mustn't let him land!
Who?
Who?
Halfdan the Black.
Halfdan the Black.
But, Erik...
Just give me a hand.
I mean, you could have killed yourself.
Where's the Cloak Invisible?
Why?
No!
I'll bring it back.
I'll bring it back.
Erik. You don't understand.
Erik. You don't understand.
No. It's YOU who doesn't understand, Aud. Halfdan has come to kill and destroy. We brought him here. We must stop him.
No. It's YOU who doesn't understand, Aud. Halfdan has come to kill and destroy. We brought him here. We must stop him.
But you don't realize....
But you don't realize....
Goodbye, Aud...
And thanks for the Cloak Invisible!
No! WAIT! ERIK! The Cloak! The Cloak Invisible! It only seems to work on my father!
No! No! We are in the spell of the Horn! Hatred will destroy us.
That's right!
No. Don't look... The abyss will suck away your strength.
I MUST look! Keitel! Hold this!
YOU still want to go to Asgaard?
Of course.
Of course.
Do you believe I love you?
Do you believe I love you?
I... but I...
I... but I...
You don't have to love me. Just: do you believe I love YOU?
You don't have to love me. Just: do you believe I love YOU?
Yes -- I believe you do.
Yes -- I believe you do.
Then let go!
The second note.
The second note to wake the Gods...
Erik! You've done what you came to do!
Not quite...
Blow the third note! The note to take us home!
There is something I must ask the Gods...
There is something I must ask the Gods...
No living man has ever set foot in the Halls of Asgaard... The Gods will never let you return.
Then I shall come too.
No... no...
No... no...
I don't want to live WITHOUT you.
I don't want to live WITHOUT you.
But, Aud... I... I came to find someone...
LOKI! Where did YOU come from?
Halfdan wanted to stop you waking the Gods... so... I disguised myself to sabotage their plans.
But --
It was my master Keitel's idea.
But... How is it you can see me? You can all see me?
What d'you mean?
How do we know this is the way?
We blew the Horn Resounding.
We blew the Horn Resounding.
SHE blew the Horn Resounding.
Now what CAN you want with me, Erik the "Viking"?
I shouldn't have come.
I shouldn't have come.
They will make fun of you for listening to an old woman's stories?
What do you see, Erik?
I see the world.
I see the world.
Is it night or day, Erik?
Is it night or day, Erik?
It is day, of course, Freya.
It is day, of course, Freya.
Is it summer or winter, Erik?
Have you ever seen the sun, Erik?
The sun is up beyond the clouds -- where it always is.
The sun is up beyond the clouds -- where it always is.
But have you ever seen it? Think back...
But have you ever seen it? Think back...
Of course not... but... when I was a child... I remember a dream.... it was as if the whole sky was blue...
Of course not... but... when I was a child... I remember a dream.... it was as if the whole sky was blue...
The sky WAS blue, Erik... once.
Is there nothing men can do?
The Gods are asleep, Erik.
The Gods are asleep, Erik.
I will go and wake them up!
And will the dead ever return, Freya?
That I cannot tell you.
No... we don't...
The Gods decreed that if ever a sword spills human blood upon these shores, the whole of Hy-Brasil will sink beneath the waves.
How?
Well... for a start... er... there's no killing...
Well... for a start... er... there's no killing...
Well, OBVIOUSLY there's no killing.
Well, OBVIOUSLY there's no killing.
Well... isn't it great?
Would you like us to sing to you?
That's very kind of you, but we're in rather a hurry... We're...
What's the matter, don't you WANT to hear our singing?
Oh... well, yes, of course; it's just we're looking for the Horn Resounding and --
Oh... well, yes, of course; it's just we're looking for the Horn Resounding and --
You don't think our singing's going to be good enough for you?
You don't think our singing's going to be good enough for you?
Oh, no no no! It's just the Horn Resounding is...
Oh, no no no! It's just the Horn Resounding is...
A lot of people like our singing.
A lot of people like our singing.
I'm sure it's lovely.
I'm sure it's lovely.
But you don't want to hear it.
But you don't want to hear it.
No... no... We'd love to hear it. Wouldn't we?
Er... well... we... we... would be TERRIBLY grateful if you... all... would sing for us.
You're just saying that.
Of course we're not; we'd genuinely like to hear you sing.
REALLY?
REALLY?
Really.
Really.
And you're not just saying it because you think we want you to?
No.
Right! Summon the musicians! We'll do the one that goes "TUM-TUM-TUM- TUM-TI-TUM-TUM"
We're just not a very musical nation...
No, no... It was very... er, nice.
No, no... It was very... er, nice.
Now I want you to be ABSOLUTELY, totally, genuinely honest with me. Did you really, truly, honestly like it?
No.
They didn't like it! Oh God! I want to die!
Your Majesty! We come from a world where there IS no music. Where men live and die by the axe and by the sword...
Well, how d'you think I feel?
Well, how d'you think I feel?
The Gods are asleep, King Arnulf.
The Gods are asleep, King Arnulf.
YOU try to be nice to people, when they're rude about your singing...
I'll tell you what...
Yes?
Careful! They're not supposed to hurt you.
You've got to let me go!
It's all part of our safety regulations. You see if someone were to get hurt they might get angry and then... well...
They'll be more than "hurt" if Halfdan the Black lands! Ow!
He's trying to stop us waking the Gods.
Why?
Why?
Because that's how he makes his money, by war and plunder!
Because that's how he makes his money, by war and plunder!
Don't talk nonsense.
Don't talk nonsense.
He wants to kill US!
He wants to kill US!
Not when we explain about the Great Blessing.
Not when we explain about the Great Blessing.
You don't know Halfdan the Black.
You don't know Halfdan the Black.
I know that the Great Blessing has kept the peace for a thousand years, and will keep it for the next thousand.
Is there something the matter with it?
Oh! No! No... of course not... it's just I hadn't expected it to be quite so big.
Oh! No! No... of course not... it's just I hadn't expected it to be quite so big.
Well, it's not called the Horn Resounding for nothing. You DO know how to play the horn, don't you?
Well, it's not called the Horn Resounding for nothing. You DO know how to play the horn, don't you?
Yes... oh, yes...
Yes... oh, yes...
Then I expect you'll be leaving first thing in the morning.
But it IS! Look!
The important thing is not to panic.
Have you done this sort of thing before?
Me? Of course! I've been looting and pillaging up and down the coast.
Me? Of course! I've been looting and pillaging up and down the coast.
Looting and pillaging, eh?
Looting and pillaging, eh?
Yes.
Yes.
What about the raping?
What about the raping?
Shut up.
Shut up.
It's obvious you haven't raped anyone in your life.
It's obvious you haven't raped anyone in your life.
Sh!
Of course I like women... I LOVE 'em.
You don't love ME.
You don't love ME.
No... right... this is RAPE... Mark you, I'm not saying I couldn't get to like you... in fact... well, to be quite honest, I prefer it when there's some sort of mutual feeling between two people...
No... right... this is RAPE... Mark you, I'm not saying I couldn't get to like you... in fact... well, to be quite honest, I prefer it when there's some sort of mutual feeling between two people...
What -- rape?
What -- rape?
No. It isn't rape then, is it?
No. It isn't rape then, is it?
Oh, get it over with.
Oh, get it over with.
I don't suppose... no...
I don't suppose... no...
What?
What?
I don't suppose you... you DO like me at all?
I don't suppose you... you DO like me at all?
What d'you expect? You come in here, burn my village, kill my family and try to rape me...
I'll kill you if you say anything about this to anyone.
About raping me?
About raping me?
About NOT raping you...
About NOT raping you...
You DON'T like it, do you?
You DON'T like it, do you?
Well it just seems a little bit crude, that's all.
Well it just seems a little bit crude, that's all.
What about the killing and looting? That's just as crude, isn't it?
What about the killing and looting? That's just as crude, isn't it?
Oh well -- you've GOT to do them.
Oh well -- you've GOT to do them.
Why? Why have you got to go round killing and looting?
Why? Why have you got to go round killing and looting?
To pay for the next expedition, of course.
To pay for the next expedition, of course.
But that's a circular argument! If the only reason for going on an expedition is the killing and looting and the only reason for the killing and looting is to pay for the next expedition, they cancel each other out.
But that's a circular argument! If the only reason for going on an expedition is the killing and looting and the only reason for the killing and looting is to pay for the next expedition, they cancel each other out.
Oh! Stop talking as if we were married!
Oh! Stop talking as if we were married!
Well you started it.
Well you started it.
I just said I didn't feel like raping you.
I just said I didn't feel like raping you.
And I was just saying that rape is no MORE pointless or crude than all the killing and looting that goes on.
Scream.
Ah.
Ah.
Louder.
Louder.
Aaagh! Rape!
Aaagh! Rape!
Oh, thanks.
Thanks for saving me from a fate worse than death.
I didn't mean to!
I didn't mean to!
Oh, that's all right then... it's the thought... that counts...
You told them I raped you -- why?
I dunno... you looked so... so vulnerable...
I dunno... you looked so... so vulnerable...
Why should you care?
Why should you care?
Why... should YOU care?
Why... should YOU care?
Tell me your name?
I've come to take you back to the land of the living.
What a stupid idea.
What a stupid idea.
Why?
Why?
What's the point of being dead in the land of the living?
What's the point of being dead in the land of the living?
I'll ask the Gods to give you life again!
Have you tried to ask the God for anything?
Well... no...
Is THAT Odin?
You'll have to wait till he's finished his game.
You'll have to wait till he's finished his game.
Odin!
Why should you care?
I don't know! I just did!
FIND the Rainbow Bridge?
Find it... AND cross it!
"But" what?
But...
But...
What?
Nothing... Halfdan the Black chopped his hand off last night.
He was lucky... Sit there.
What are you talking about?
Come on, move it!
It's Halfdan the Black!
I know. Snorri! Get your oar out!
Erik! Row! What are you doing?
It saved my father!
How deep IS the ocean?
Very deep... usually...
Let's hack her to pieces.
No.
What's wrong with making friends?
You don't go through all the hardships of an ocean voyage to make "friends".
That's terrible!
You mean if just ONE PERSON gets killed?
Halfdan the Black's here!
I know!
I know!
He wants to KILL us.
But. You're not even afraid of DEATH, Thorfinn!
I know. I know.
It's not magic! It's just a trick!
Don't you FEEL it?
We're missing all the fun...
What's it all about?
What's it all about?
What?
What?
We toil and labor, we loot and pillage, rape and kill... and yet...

It's always the women that start the trouble.
It's always the women that start the trouble.
She got me thinking...
She got me thinking...
So? What'd you do to her?
I... I... KILLED her...
That's my boy!
He can have my place. I don't want to go anyway.
Well, you ARE!
I want to die... No, I don't!
Row! Row! Row!
Slower! Nobody can row at that speed!
Sorry.
Slower! In... Out...
Sorry!
Faster!
Make your mind up.
What are YOU doing here?
You may need a real Berserk.
Ohh! I wanted to sit next to Leif.
Shut up. You there. You there and you there.
SHUT UP!
ROW!
Look, the sky is blue...
The sun! That's it!
It's magic.
What "magic"?
What "magic"?
I've heard stories of a magic that strikes fear into the heart so you cannot fight.
What "magic" have you brought, Erik?
You'll see!
What did he say?
Look out!
You must help us.
We don't HAVE to help anybody.
We don't HAVE to help anybody.
Fenrir the Wolf covers the sun -- men fight and kill each other the whole time.
Fenrir the Wolf covers the sun -- men fight and kill each other the whole time.
Why should WE care?
Why should WE care?
Because... you're... you're the Gods....
Because... you're... you're the Gods....
So?
So?
Bring the Age of Ragnarok to an end and stop all this fighting and bloodshed.
Erik the Viking! The things you seek are not in our power. We don't make men love each other or hate each other.
But you're the Gods!
But you're the Gods!
Look... Erik...
You mean we'd be dead?
No! We'd be the first living men to set foot in the Halls of the Gods.
Thank you VERY much indeed.
Now stop it!
Now stop it!
It's SO nice to feel wanted.
It's SO nice to feel wanted.
Leif, you sit there. Even, you sit there. Harald, you'd better sit over there...
Leif, you sit there. Even, you sit there. Harald, you'd better sit over there...
Trust me to get the missionary.
You can't have Sven's father sitting next to Sven. They'll argue the whole time.
That's true. You'd better sit there. You there, and Ornulf there.
That's true. You'd better sit there. You there, and Ornulf there.
Now you've got all the big ones on one side.
That's better.
Now you've got all the ones with beards on one side and all the moustaches on the other.
Row!
Has anyone told him we've got a dragon eating our boat?
First we're flying -- now we're sinking!
Well, come on!
Listen! Maybe we won't get to Hy- Brasil! Maybe we won't find the Horn Resounding... but at least we've tried... and at least we shall have died like men.
Like fish.
A magic dishcloth.
To the oars!
Weren't we supposed to?
Oh... I feel a little... oh...
No! Let go, Snorri!
I've got you!
I've got you!
You'll be sucked down too!
You'll be sucked down too!
No! Arrgh!
There is another way.
Who gets killed?
Who gets killed?
Nobody gets killed.
You need to say a bit more than that!
Oh... er... yes...

Right. Farewell... for the last time... may the gods prevent...
No, don't say anything else!
Wait, Erik!
Keitel Blacksmith?
Bjorn's not. He could have Bjorn's place.
What's the matter with Bjorn?
What do you think?
But how could he know... unless...
And you, Keitel Blacksmith.
But...
Well, what else do we do?
How about making friends?
So Halfdan the Black's using magic, is he? Well, I have a magic to match his!
What is it?
Don't you see, Erik! She wants revenge!
What are you talking about?
And you, Sven, aren't you afraid of crossing the Rainbow Bridge to Asgaard?
I will join my grandfather there.
What are you talking about, Erik?
What if we could find Bi-Frost the Rainbow Bridge?
Only the dead reach Asgaard, Erik.
What's the matter? Are you afraid to try?
Nobody's ever crossed the Rainbow Bridge to Asgaard.
We'd be the first!
But HOW?
I don't know -- but I'm not afraid to try.
Hey, you two! What's going on?
I was sitting there.
Look, I bagged it last week.
It doesn't matter WHERE you sit!
It doesn't matter WHERE you sit!
Yes it does! We could be at sea for months.

Well, what difference does it make where you're SITTING?
Well, what difference does it make where you're SITTING?
I don't want to have to sit next to Snorri all that time.
I AM one, Dad!
We haven't got a spare place.
ROW!
DEATH!
She hasn't got any.
She MUST have a knife or something...
Hy-Brasil?
Is THIS Hy-Brasil?
We must blow the first note... he note that will take us to Asgaard...
Over the Edge of the World.
Sven!
Let me do something for myself for a change!
I came to find my grandfather.
I have to go...
Bye, Leif.
Bye... sorry...
Bye... sorry...
Yeah... well...
Yeah... well...
You will wait?
You will wait?
What d'you expect me to do?
That's why they call me... Leif the Lucky.
Please.
What's all the panic about?
The Dragon...
It can't do you any HARM...
What do we have to do?
What do we have to do?
Nothing... I just immerse you in water...
How did he do that?
Do what?
Do what?
Vanish into thin air?
Vanish into thin air?
He hasn't.
He hasn't.
Well, where is he then?
You coming? You don't even believe in Asgaard.
I thought I might do a bit of business on the way.

What are you doing, Keitel Blacksmith?
What are you doing, Keitel Blacksmith?
Get away, Snorri.
Get away, Snorri.
What have you got there?
Ooh, that's a good one! You could charge Halfdan fifteen for that one.
Yes, it is good. But I told him ten.
Yes, it is good. But I told him ten.
You could charge him what you like.
You just can't make enough swords and spears and knives and daggers to satisfy the demand. You could charge Halfdan twenty and he'd pay it.
Oh, I couldn't do that! The Blacksmith's Code says...
Oh, I couldn't do that! The Blacksmith's Code says...
Yes yes... of course.... the "Blacksmith's Code"...
If this IS the Age of Ragnarok, Keitel Blacksmith, it is GOOD to us.
Can't make enough swords!
Can't make enough swords!
Can't make enough axe-heads!
Can't make enough axe-heads!
But, Keitel, if Erik ever finds the Horn Resounding... if he ever crosses Bi-Frost, the Rainbow Bridge... if he ever wakens the gods..
They chase Fenrir the Wolf from the sky...
The Age of Ragnarok ends...

The bottom falls out of the sword business!

And if you have to kill somebody, KILL them! Don't stop to think about it.
I never do...
I don't know, honey. It's horrible.
She's punishing me for being honest. I should just go to her house.
Maybe you need to look at this as a sign to move on. Just make a clean break.
I don't know. I'm so... I can't believe she'd be so goddamn immature!
You weren't supposed to see that.
They can't erase memories. It's a joke. It's a nasty Clementine hoax.

Say hi to Naomi.
I'm sorry Naomi couldn't make it. You okay? You seem quiet.
Just a little overworked, maybe.
I remember you turned around. Your face was dark and your hair was backlit -- I could see a halo of frizz -- you asked me if things were okay between Naomi and me.
I did. You said, things were fine.
I did. You said, things were fine.

Who was the girl you walked off with?
No one.
Shit. The last time I saw you.
Anyhoo, sweetie, I done a bad thing. I kinda sorta wrecked your car...
But I thought, I don't know, I thought it was cool that you were sensitive enough to know what I was feeling and that you were attracted to it.
But, I don't know, maybe we're the normal ones, y'know? I mean, what kind of people do well at this stuff?

In the room?

In the world.
Oh, baby, what's going on?
I don't know. I'm lost. I'm scared. I feel like I'm disappearing. I'm getting old and nothing makes any sense to me.

I'm excited, too. Oh, and I wanted to give you this. It's a little... thing.
I didn't have a chance to wrap it.
It's gorgeous. Just my taste. I've never gone out with a guy who brought me a piece of jewelry I liked. Thanks. So let's get going. Long drive.
What's wrong with me?
Nothing is wrong with you. You're the most wonderful person I've ever met.
How are you today?
Okay, I guess.
Okay, I guess.
Well, why don't you tell me what's going on? Do you mind if I turn this on?
Well, I've been having a bad time of it with um, my boyfriend, I guess.
You guess he's your boyfriend? Or you guess you're having a bad time with him?
You guess he's your boyfriend? Or you guess you're having a bad time with him?
What? No. I don't like the term boyfriend. It's so gay.
Maybe gay isn't the right word. But, anyway, it's been rough with him... whatever the fuck he is. Heheh. My significant other... heh heh. And I guess on a certain level, I want to break it off, but I feel... y'know... it's like this constant questioning and re questioning. Do I end it? Should I give it more time? I'm not happy, but what
I think I know. I think we can help. Why don't you start by telling me about your relationship. Everything you can think of. Everything about him. Everything about you. And we'll take it from there.
I'm sorry.
Why?
Why?
Why what?
Why what?
Why are you sorry? I just said hi.

Anyway. Sorry. Hi.
It's okay if I sit closer? So I don't have to scream. Not that I don't need to scream sometimes, believe me. But I don't want to bug you if you're trying to write or something.
No, I mean, I don't know. I can't really think of much to say probably.
No, I mean, I don't know. I can't really think of much to say probably.

Frost?
Frost?
Yeah. I'm not, like, a Robert Frost lover by any stretch. His stuff seems strictly grade school to me. But this made me cry for some reason. Maybe because it is grade school. Y'know?
Yeah. I'm not, like, a Robert Frost lover by any stretch. His stuff seems strictly grade school to me. But this made me cry for some reason. Maybe because it is grade school. Y'know?
It's pretty.
It's pretty.
I miss grade school. I don't know why I'm calling it grade school all of a sudden. When I went we called it elementary school. But I like grade school better. Sounds like something someone from the forties would call it. I'd like to be from then. Everyone wore hats. Anyway, cheers!

God, that feels so fucking good. Take yours off.
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
Yeah? Well, have a seat, anyway.
Ready for another?
No, I'm okay for now.
What do you want to hear?
You pick it.
You pick it.
You just say. I'm not really --
You just say. I'm not really --
I don't know! I can't see them from here, Joel! Just pick something good.
Well, I should probably get going.
No, stay. Just for a little while. Refill?
No, stay. Just for a little while. Refill?
No. I --
No. I --
I know a man who needs a refill.
Thanks.
Drink up, young man. It'll make the whole seduction part less repugnant.
Y'know, I'm sort of psychic.
Yeah?
Yeah?
Well, I go to a psychic and she's always telling me I'm psychic. She should know. Do you believe in that stuff?
Well, I go to a psychic and she's always telling me I'm psychic. She should know. Do you believe in that stuff?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Me neither. But sometimes I have premonitions, so, I don't know. Maybe that's just coincidence. Right? Y'know, you think something and then it happens, or you think a word and then someone says it? Y'know?

Yeah, I don't know. It's hard to know.
Yeah, I don't know. It's hard to know.
Exactly. Exactly! That's exactly my feeling about it. It's hard to know. Like, okay, but how many times do I think something and it doesn't happen? That's what you're saying, right? You forget about those times. Right?

But I think I am. I like to think I am.

It's helpful to think there's some order to things. You're kind of closed mouthed, aren't you?

Sorry. My life isn't that interesting. I go to work. I go home. I don't know what to say.
Sorry. My life isn't that interesting. I go to work. I go home. I don't know what to say.
Oh. Does that make you sad? Or anxious? I'm always anxious thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest, y'know? Taking advantage of every possibility? Just making sure that I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have.

I think about that.
You're really nice. I'm sorry I yelled at you before about it. God, I'm an idiot.
I do have a tendency to use that word too much.
I do have a tendency to use that word too much.
I like you. That's the thing about my psychic thing. I think that's my greatest psychic power, that I get a sense about people. My problem is I never trust it. But I get it. And with you I get that you're a really good guy.

And, anyway, you sell yourself short. I can tell. There's a lot of stuff going on in your brain. I can tell. My goal... can I tell you my goal?
And, anyway, you sell yourself short. I can tell. There's a lot of stuff going on in your brain. I can tell. My goal... can I tell you my goal?
Yeah.
Yeah.
What's the goal, Joel? My goal, Joel, is to just let it flow through me? Do you know what I mean? It's like, there's all these emotions and ideas and they come quick and they change and they leave and they come back in a different form and I think we're all taught we should be consistent. Y'know? You love someone -- that's it.

Like I wanted to talk to you. I didn't need any more reason to do it. Who knows what bigger cosmic reason might exist?

You're very nice. God, I have to stop saying that. You're nervous around me, huh?
You're very nice. God, I have to stop saying that. You're nervous around me, huh?
No.
No.
I'm nervous. You don't need to be nervous around me, though. I like you. Do you think I'm repulsively fat?
I'm nervous. You don't need to be nervous around me, though. I like you. Do you think I'm repulsively fat?
No, not at all.
No, not at all.
I don't either. I used to. But I'm through with that. Y'know, if I don't love my body, then I'm just lost. You know? With all the wrinkles and scars and the general falling apart that's coming 'round the bend. So, I've been seeing this guy...
Well, for the last week, anyway! He's kind of a kid. Kind of a goofball, but he's really stuck on me, which is flattering. Who wouldn't like that? And he's, like, a dope, but he says these smart and moving things sometimes, out of nowhere, that just break my heart. He's the one who gave me that crow photograph.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
That made me cry. But, anyway, we went up to Boston, because I had this urge to lie on my back on the Charles River. It gets frozen this time of year.

That's scary sounding.
That's scary sounding.
Exactly! I used to do it in college and I had this urge to go do it again, so I got Patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me, but I was really disappointment to be there with him. Y'know? And that's where psychic stuff comes in. Like, it just isn't right with

I think so.
I don't believe in that soulmate crap anymore, but... he says so many great things. We like the same writers. This writer Stephen Dixon he turned me on to. And he's cute. It's fucked up. Joel, you should come up to the Charles with me sometime.

Okay.
Yeah? Oh, great!
I'll pack a picnic -- a night picnic -- night picnics are different -- and --
Sounds good. But right now I should go.

You should stay.

I have to get up early in the morning tomorrow, so...
I have to get up early in the morning tomorrow, so...
Okay.
I would like you to call me. Would you do that? I would like that.
Yes.
So, I enjoyed meeting you.
You'll call me, right?
You'll call me, right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
When?
When?
Tomorrow?
Tomorrow?
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines and all.
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines and all.
Okay.
How could she have done this to me? How could anyone do this to anyone?
You didn't say anything about my hair.
Yo ho ho!
It's three.
I can't believe you wrecked my car. You're driving drunk. It's pathetic.
...a little. I was a little tipsy. Don't call me pathetic.
...a little. I was a little tipsy. Don't call me pathetic.
Well it is pathetic. And fucking irresponsible. You could've killed somebody.
I don't know, maybe you did kill somebody.
Oh Christ I didn't kill anybody. It's just a fucking dent. You're like some old lady or something.
A wino? Jesus, Are you from the fifties? A wino! Face it, Joel. You're freaked out because I was out late without you, and in your little wormy brain, you're trying to figure out, did she fuck someone tonight?
No, see, Clem, I assume you fucked someone tonight. Isn't that how you get people to like you?
Let me drive you home.
Fuck you, Joel. Faggot.
Fuck you, Joel. Faggot.
Look at it out here. It's falling apart. I'm erasing you. And I'm happy.
How can you watch this crap?
Where are you going?
Where are you going?
I'm fucking crawling out of my skin.
Oh shit. I remember this. Want to go?
I want to have a baby.
I want to have a baby.
Let's talk about it later.
Let's talk about it later.
No. I want to have a baby. I have to have a baby.
No. I want to have a baby. I have to have a baby.
I don't think we're ready.
I don't think we're ready.
You're not ready.
You're not ready.
Clementine, do you really think you could take care of a kid?
What?!
I don't want to talk about this here.
I don't want to talk about this here.
Joel, We're fucking gonna talk about it!
You can't fucking say something like that and say you don't want to talk about it!
Clem, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have --
Clem, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have --
I'd make a fucking good mother! I love children! I'm creative and smart and I'd make a fucking good mother!
Oh, thank God. It's going.
It's you! It's you who can't commit to anything! You have no idea how lucky you are I'm interested in you! I don't even know why I am! I should just end it right here, Joel. Leave you in the zoo. Maybe you could find a nice sloth to hang out with!
So, um --
Would you get me another, Joely?
You're drunk.
You're a whiz kid. So perceptive, so --
You don't tell me things, Joel. I'm an open book. I tell you everything. Every damn embarrassing thing. You don't trust me.
No, it isn't that.
No, it isn't that.
I want to know you.
I want to know you.
I just don't have anything very interesting about my life.
I just don't have anything very interesting about my life.
Joel, you're a liar.
More?
No. Thanks.
Joely...
Yeah, Tangerine?
Yeah, Tangerine?
Do you know The Velveteen Rabbit?
Do you know The Velveteen Rabbit?
No.
No.
It's my favorite book. Since I was a kid. It's about these toys. There's this part where the skin Horse tells the rabbit what it means to be real. I can't believe I'm crying already. He says, "It takes a long time. That's why it doesn't often happen to people who break easily or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept.
Such a beautiful view.
Yes indeed. Fuck! They're erasing you, Clem!
Yes indeed. Fuck! They're erasing you, Clem!
Oh?
Oh?
I hired them to. We're in my brain. But I want it to stop, before I wake up and don't know you anymore.
I hired them to. We're in my brain. But I want it to stop, before I wake up and don't know you anymore.
Wow. Um, well... can't you just force yourself awake?
Wow. Um, well... can't you just force yourself awake?
I don't know.
What if you hide me?
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
Well... if they're looking for me in memories I'm in, what if you take me to a memory I'm not in? And we can hide there till morning.
I want my mommy. I don't want to lose you, Clem.
I'm right here.
I'm right here.
I'm scared. I want my mommy. I don't want to lose you. I don't want to lose...
I'm scared. I want my mommy. I don't want to lose you. I don't want to lose...
Joel, Joely, look... it's not fading. The memory. I think we're hidden.
You know, we're okay. They're not finding us. You'll remember me in the morning. And you'll come to me and tell me about us and we'll start over.
I loved you so much this day. On my bed in your panties. I remember I thought, how impossibly lucky am I to have you on my bed in your panties.
You remember what happened next?
I came over to the bed and you smelled so good, like you just woke up, slightly sweaty. And I climbed on the bed with you and you said something like --
I came over to the bed and you smelled so good, like you just woke up, slightly sweaty. And I climbed on the bed with you and you said something like --
-- another rainy day. Whatever shall we do?
There's this guy!
What?
What?
There's this guy. I heard him talking in my apartment. He's one of the eraser guys. And he fell for you when they were erasing you, so he introduced himself the next day as if he were a stranger and now you're dating him.

Really? Is he cute?
Really? Is he cute?
He stole a pair of your panties while you were being erased!
He stole a pair of your panties while you were being erased!
Gross! You must remember to tell me this in the morning. I'm, like, so freaked out now.
But can't you see... I love you, Antoine.
Don't call me Antoine. My name is Wally.
Don't call me Antoine. My name is Wally.
Yes, but I can't love a man named Wally.
They found us before. The plan didn't work. I don't know what to do now.
Hide me somewhere deeper? Somewhere buried?
Look at you, cutey! What are we doing?
This kid, Joe Early, is going to beat the shit out of me.
Joel!
I don't like it either, but I'm just trying to find horrible secret place to --
Happy Birthday.
Thanks, Joely. A present! Oh boy!
I scoured the city for it.
I love it!
I'm done, Clem. I'm just going to ride it out. Hiding is clearly not working.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I want to enjoy my little time left with you.

This is our first "date" date.

Do you remember what we talked about?
Do you remember what we talked about?
Naomi, I guess.
Naomi, I guess.
Yeah.
Yeah.
What was I wearing?
What was I wearing?
God, I should know. Your hair was red. I remember it matched the wallpaper.
God, I should know. Your hair was red. I remember it matched the wallpaper.
Egad, were you horrified?
Egad, were you horrified?
No! I think you were wearing that black dress, y'know, with the buttons.
Right. Something black though.
I'll buy that. Black's always good.
I'll buy that. Black's always good.
We did talk about Naomi.

I said: Are you sure? You seem unsure.
I said: Are you sure? You seem unsure.
I'm sure, I said.
I'm sure, I said.
But you weren't. I could tell.
But you weren't. I could tell.
I was so nervous. I remember I couldn't think of anything to say. There were long silences.
I thought I was foolish. I thought I'd mistaken infatuation for love. You said:
So what. Infatuation is good, too.
So what. Infatuation is good, too.
And I didn't have an argument.
I dropped you off after. You said --
Come up and see me... now.
Come up and see me... now.
It's very late.
It's very late.
Yes, exactly. Exactly my point.
I told her today I need to end it.
Is that what you want?
Is that what you want?
I did it. I guess that means something.
I didn't think you'd show your face around me again. I figured you were humiliated. You did run away, after all.
Sorry to track you down like this. I'm not a stalker. But I needed to see you.
Sorry to track you down like this. I'm not a stalker. But I needed to see you.
Yeah?
Yeah?
I'd like to... take you out or something.
I'd like to... take you out or something.
Well, you're married.
Well, you're married.
Not yet. Not married.
Not yet. Not married.
Look, man, I'm telling you right off the bat, I'm high maintenance. So I'm not going to tiptoe around your marriage or whatever it is you got going there. If you want to be with me, you're with me.
Look, man, I'm telling you right off the bat, I'm high maintenance. So I'm not going to tiptoe around your marriage or whatever it is you got going there. If you want to be with me, you're with me.
Okay.
Okay.
So make your domestic decisions and maybe we'll talk again.
Joel, I'm not a concept. I want you to just keep that in your head. Too many guys think I'm a concept or I complete them or I'm going to make them alive, but I'm just a fucked-up girl who is looking for my own peace of mind. Don't assign me yours.
I remember that speech really well.
I remember that speech really well.
I had you pegged, didn't I?
I had you pegged, didn't I?
You had the whole human race pegged.

Probably.

I still thought you were going to save me. Even after that.

I know.

It would be different, if we could just give it another go around.
It would be different, if we could just give it another go around.
Remember me. Try your best. Maybe we can.
Hi there.
Hi.
You said...
I saw you sitting over here. By yourself. I thought, thank God, someone normal, who doesn't know how interact at these things either.
I saw you sitting over here. By yourself. I thought, thank God, someone normal, who doesn't know how interact at these things either.
Yeah. I don't ever know what to say.
Yeah. I don't ever know what to say.
I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that. I mean, I don't mean I'm happy you're uncomfortable, but, yknow... I'm such a loser. Every time I come to a party I tell myself I'm going to be different and it's always exactly the same and then I hate myself after for being such a clod.

Even then I didn't believe you entirely. I thought how could you be talking to me if you couldn't talk to people?
You know what I did.
Yeah, I know. I'm fishing.
Yeah, I know. I'm fishing.
You said --
I'm Clementine. Can I borrow a piece of your chicken?
And you picked it out of my plate before I could answer and it felt so intimate like we were already lovers.
Oh God, how horrid.
I'm Joel.
You mean, like... Oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', Clementine... ? Huckleberry Hound? That sort of thing?
Yeah, like that.
Yeah, like that.
Nope. No jokes. My favorite thing when I was a kid was my Huckleberry Hound doll. I think your name is magic.
This is it, Joel. It's gonna be gone soon.
I know.
I know.
What do we do?
What do we do?
Enjoy it. Say good-bye.
No, I stopped. I didn't want to feel like I was being artificially modulated.
I know what you mean. That's why I stopped.
I know what you mean. That's why I stopped.
But my sleeping is really fucked up.

I don't think I've slept in a year.

I think, before.

Seems too coincidental that way.
Seems too coincidental that way.
Yeah, maybe.
Do you know her poem that starts "Seaside gusts of wind,/And a house in which we don't live...
Yeah, yeah. It goes "Perhaps there is someone in this world to whom I could send all these lines"?
Yeah, yeah. It goes "Perhaps there is someone in this world to whom I could send all these lines"?
Yes! I love that poem. It breaks my heart. I'm so excited you know it. Look, houses in which we don't live.
I wish we did. You married?
Um, no.
Um, no.
Let's move into this neighborhood.
I do sort of live with somebody though.
Oh.
Male or female?
Female.
Female.
At least I haven't been barking up the wrong tree.
Cool.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
It's freezing out here.
C'mon, man. The water's fine. Nobody's coming here tonight, believe me. This place is closed up. Electricity's off.
I hesitated for what seemed like forever.
I hesitated for what seemed like forever.
I could see you wanted to come in, Joel.
I knew.
I knew by your nervousness that Naomi wasn't the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass.

It's dark.

Yeah. What's your girlfriend's name?
Yeah. What's your girlfriend's name?
Naomi.
Ah-ha! Now I can look for candles, matches, and the liquor cabinet.
I think we should go.
I think we should go.
No, it's our house! Just tonight -- -- we're David and Ruth Laskin. Which one do you want to be? I prefer to be Ruth but I'm flexible. Alcohol! You make drinks. I'm going find the bedroom and slip into something more Ruth. I'm ruthless at the moment.
So go.
I did. I walked out the door. I felt like I was a scared little kid. I thought you knew that about me. I ran back to the bonfire, trying to outrun my humiliation. You said, "so go" with such disdain.

What if you stay this time?

I walked out the door. There's no more memory.
I walked out the door. There's no more memory.
Come back and make up a good-bye at least. Let's pretend we had one.
Bye, Joel.
I love you.
So you'll call me, right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
When?
When?
Tomorrow?
Tomorrow?
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines.
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines.
Yeah.
Don't worry. It's really solid this time of year.
I don't know.
I don't know. What if it breaks?
What if?
I think I should go back.
Joel, come here. Please.
Listen, did you want to make love?
Make love?
Make love?
Have sex. Y'know --

Oh, um...

Says you were a bully...

I sort of do. But I only see it as a fantasy version of reality. Cleaned up enough to be erotic.

We should have sex. It's old hat for us.
You're still excited by my irreverence. You haven't yet started to think of it as my "gratuitous need to shock."
I can't stop thinking about you.
I can't stop thinking about you.
Yay. Meet me after work by the old mill.
Yay. Meet me after work by the old mill.
What old mill? Is that somewhere we --
What old mill? Is that somewhere we --
I just wanted to say that. Come by my house.
What took you so long?
I just walked in.
I just walked in.
Hmmm. Do you miss me?
Hmmm. Do you miss me?
Oddly enough, I do.
Oddly enough, I do.
Ha Ha! You said, I do. I guess that means we're married.
Ha Ha! You said, I do. I guess that means we're married.
I guess so.
I guess so.
Tomorrow night... honeymoon on ice.
Yeah?
Did you send this? Is it a joke?
Did you send this? Is it a joke?
I probably got the same thing as you.
I probably got the same thing as you.
I mean, I haven't even told anyone I've met you. Who would even know to do this?
I mean, I haven't even told anyone I've met you. Who would even know to do this?
Maybe it's true then. It's my voice on the tape.
Maybe it's true then. It's my voice on the tape.
That's what you have to say? How could it be true? I never even heard of any procedure like this. It's a joke.
It's true.
I know. I spoke to my friend Magda.
Look, I have to go. I have to think.
Joel, we've fucked. We've made love. Like a million times. And we were so sweet and shy and inept with each other last night. Isn't that lovely?
Hi, it's Joel.
Hey, lover. Whatcha doing?
Hey, lover. Whatcha doing?
I'm just, y'know, passing the time best I can till I can see you.
I'm just, y'know, passing the time best I can till I can see you.
God, I can't believe I ever hated you.

You must have been crazy.

Guess what I'm wearing.

I don't know. Panties and --
I don't know. Panties and --
Your dried cum.
Your dried cum.
Jesus.
Hi, Naomi, it's Joel.
Hi.
Hi.
How's it going?
How's it going?
Good. I called you at work today. They said you were home sick.
Good. I called you at work today. They said you were home sick.
I know. I had to take the day to think.
I know. I had to take the day to think.
Yeah, I tried you at home. Did you get my message?
Yeah, I tried you at home. Did you get my message?
I just got in.
I just got in.
Long day thinking.
That's me.
There you are. Naomi, it's just... I'm afraid if we fall back into this fast without considering the problems we had...
It was snowing.
There are two of them. Couldn't make them out. The orange glow of a cigarette.
The driver waved. So casual, friendly.
I'm like a joke to them.
I might be making a mistake.
Maybe I'm making a mistake. Maybe I just need to learn to live with this. First of all, I'll get over it. Secondly, it happened. Those who do not remember history are condemned to repeat it. Who said that? Churchill? I'm not sure. But I don't care. She did it to me. I have to rid myself of this. Fuck her.

Who said that? Churchill? I'm not sure. But I don't care. She did it to me. I have to rid myself of this. Fuck her.
Fuck you, Clementine.
Pink. There was a number on it. I remember. AL 1718? I have to follow through with this. I have no choice.
The pill was pink, I remember. It had some letters and numbers on it. What were they? AL 1718? AL something. Four digits. I don't like taking pills when I don't know what they are. I have no choice.
It's them.
It's too late.
I should maybe talk to you.
Clementine. I should just maybe talk to her.
I love you and if you knew that... if I told you what happened... I'll explain everything, what we meant to each other. I'll tell you everything about our time together. You'll know everything again and...
Maybe if I just explain what happened, I wouldn't have to go through this and I could tell you everything and it would be like you knew and we could rebuild and we could be happy again and...
Clementine.
That's your look for me.
Gotta get home. How could she do this to me? How could she not care about what we meant to each other. What a fuck! What a fucking monster she is!
Oh, God. I miss her. I can't believe she's with that guy now! I'm never going to see her again. I love her so much. What a fucking monster she is!
So then she just stops calling.
I wasn't going to call her. Not after the way she was.
I wasn't going to call her. Not after the way she was.
Any messages, Carmen?
Right! She called me an old lady here, too! And I remember, I said...
And what are you like? A wino?
How's the chicken?
Is that like us? Are we just bored with each other?
She's so sexy.
I loved you on this day. I love this memory. The rain. Us just hanging.
I can't. I have to go home. I'll do it later.
I didn't want to do this. But I had to or they would've called me a girl.
Naomi.
On the couch. Dark. Quiet. I wondered if I had made a terrible mistake. I almost reached for the phone about a thousand times. I thought I could take it back, erase it, explain I had momentarily lost my mind. Then I told myself we weren't happy. That was the truth. That what we were was safe. It was unfair to you and to
Okay. I wish you could come.
This is it. The night we met. My God, it's over.
Your back to me. In that orange sweatshirt I would come to know so well and even hate eventually. At the time I thought, how cool, an orange sweatshirt.
I remember being drawn to you even then. I thought, I love this woman because she's alone down there looking out at the black ocean.
I remember being drawn to you even then. I thought, I love this woman because she's alone down there looking out at the black ocean.
But I went back to my food. The next thing I remember, I felt someone sitting next to me and I saw the orange sleeve out of the corner of my eye.
So you're still on the Zoloft?
Next thing I remember we were walking down near the surf.
Clementine.
I couldn't believe you did that. I was paralyzed with fear.
I really should go. I really need to catch my ride.
I didn't want to go. I was too nervous. I thought, maybe you were a nut. But you were exciting. You called from upstairs.
We'll start with your most recent memories and go backwards -- There is an emotional core to each of our memories -- As we eradicate this core, it starts its degradation process -- By the time you wake up in the morning, all memories we've targeted will have withered and disappeared. Like a dream upon waking.
Is there any sort of risk of brain damage?
Is there any sort of risk of brain damage?
Well, technically, the procedure itself is brain damage, but on a par with a night of heavy drinking. Nothing you'll miss.
I'm sorry you saw one of our notification cards. You never should have.
Well... I did.
Well... I did.
We can help you through this. Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about your relationship with Clementine.
We can help you through this. Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about your relationship with Clementine.
It was a mess. I don't know how it got this way...
We can help you through this. Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about --
You have to stop this!
You have to stop this!
What? What do you mean?
What? What do you mean?
I'm trapped in my head and everything I love is being erased! Stop it now!
I'm trapped in my head and everything I love is being erased! Stop it now!
Yes, but... I'm just something you're imagining. What can I do? I'm in your head, too.
Yours?
You take it. I don't know.
Naomi, I really value our relationship. I hope it's possible for us to stay in touch.
Don't do this to me now, Joel. Really.
So what's going on, Joel?
I don't know, I've just been thinking, maybe we're not happy with each other.
I don't know, I've just been thinking, maybe we're not happy with each other.
What?
What?
Y'know, we've been, I don't know, sort of, unhappy with each other and --
Y'know, we've been, I don't know, sort of, unhappy with each other and --
Don't say "we" when you mean "you."
Don't say "we" when you mean "you."
I think maybe, we're both so used to operating at this level that -- How can one person be unhappy? If one person is unhappy, both have to be... by definition.

Bullshit. Who is it? You met someone.
Bullshit. Who is it? You met someone.
No. I just need some space, maybe.
No. I just need some space, maybe.
The thing is, Joel, whatever it is you think you have with this chick, once the thrill wears off, you're just going to be Joel with the same fucking problems.

Say hi to Rob and Carrie. Have some fun!
I hope you get your work done.

So... you haven't been involved with anyone in all this time?
It's been a pretty lonely couple of years.

I'm glad you called.
So you think the dissertation will get published?
I don't know. I'm not sure there's a big public demand for books on Calvinism and Misogyny.
Okay, Joel. I suppose you're right.
I had a good time last night. I really did.
I had a good time last night. I really did.
So I'm going to get some sleep. I'm glad you're okay.

'Night.
Oh, hey, Patrick.
Hi, Mary. How's it going?
Oh, Patrick, you didn't want any, did you?
Nah, I don't know.
I love quotes. So did Winston Churchill. He actually has a quotation in Bartlett's about Bartlett's. Isn't that trippy?
Yeah. Cool.
Yeah. Cool.
"The quotations when engraved upon the memory give you good thoughts."
"The quotations when engraved upon the memory give you good thoughts."
Very cool. Trippy.

I like to read what smart people say. So many beautiful, important things.
Definitely!
I think he'll be in Bartlett's one day.
Boo.
Hi.
Stan... c'mon...
Sorry. I just --
Sorry. I just --

I better do this, Stan.
It's freezing out.
You found us okay?
You found us okay?
Yeah. Poor guy. Have anything to drink?
Yeah. Poor guy. Have anything to drink?
We haven't checked.
We haven't checked.
Well, allow me to do the honors. It's fucking freezing and I need something.
Nietzsche. Beyond Good and Evil. Found it my Bartletts.
That's a good one.
That's a good one.
Yeah, I can't wait to tell Howard! It seems really appropriate.
Yeah, I can't wait to tell Howard! It seems really appropriate.
It's a good one all right.
Yup.
Don't you think Howard's like that? Smart? Important?
Don't you think Howard's like that? Smart? Important?
Yup.
Let him go, Stan. I can help.
Go.
It's amazing, isn't it? Such a gift Howard gave the world.
Yeah.
Yeah.
To let people begin again. It's beautiful. You look at a baby and it's so fresh, so clean, so free. And adults... they're like this messy tangle of anger and phobias and sadness... hopelessness. And Howard just makes it go away.

You love him, don't you?
It's stopped.
What?
What?
Listen, it's not erasing.
It's not erasing. He's off the screen.
Where?
Where?
I don't know. He's not on the map.
I don't know what to do! I don't know what to do! Crap. Crap...
Well, what should we do?
Well, what should we do?
I don't know! I just said that!

Sor-ry We have to do something. He can't wake up half done.
Sor-ry We have to do something. He can't wake up half done.
Shit!
No way. I can handle this.
This guy's only half cooked. There's no time to fuck around, Stan.
He's coming?
You better go.
You better go.
Hell no.
Hey.
Do you swear you didn't know?
Do you swear you didn't know?
I swear.
I swear.
And you never even suspected? Never saw us behaving in any unusual way together?
And you never even suspected? Never saw us behaving in any unusual way together?
Once, maybe.
It was here. At his car. I was coming back from a job and spotted you together. You seemed caught. I waved. You giggled.
How did I look?
How did I look?
Happy. Happy with a secret.
And after that?
I never saw you together like that again. So I figured I was imagining things.
I really like you, Mary. You know that.
Do you remember anything else? What I was wearing? Was I standing close to him? Was I leaning against his car like I owned it? How did he look at me when I giggled? Tell me everything.

You were in red. That red sweater with the little flowers, I think. You were leaning against his car. He looked a little like a kid. Kind of goofy and wide-eyed. I'd never seen him look like that before. Happy. You looked beautiful. You looked in love.

Oh.
Hi.
Hi.
What do you want, Stan?
What do you want, Stan?
Can I... I brought some --
What's this?
Nothing.
Nothing.
I know what it is.
I know what it is.
Then why did you ask me?

I don't know. I just -- there are a lot of really confused people showing up at the office.
I don't know. I just -- there are a lot of really confused people showing up at the office.
They have a right to know. Howard is a thief. He steals the truth. I can't remember my baby! I can't remember my baby. It existed and I can't even remember. Do you understand that?
Mary, people come to him voluntarily.
I won't allow it. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. What do you think of that? That's from my quote book.

Okay, we're back in.
That was beautiful to watch, Howard. Like a surgeon or a concert pianist.

Well, thank you, Mary.
Do you like quotes, Howard?
How do you mean?
How do you mean?
Oh, um, like famous quotes. I find reading them inspirational to me. And in my reading I've come across some I thought you might like, too.
Oh, um, like famous quotes. I find reading them inspirational to me. And in my reading I've come across some I thought you might like, too.
Oh. Well, I'd love to hear some.
Okay, um, there's one that goes "Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders."
Is that Nietzsche?
Is that Nietzsche?
Yeah, yeah it is, Howard. And here I was thinking I could tell you something you didn't know.
Yeah, yeah it is, Howard. And here I was thinking I could tell you something you didn't know.
It's a good quote, Mary. I'm glad we both know it.
There's another one I like, I read. It's by Pope Alexander.
Alexander Pope?
Alexander Pope?
Yes, shit. Oops, sorry! Sorry. It's just I told myself I wasn't going to say Pope Alexander and sound like a dope and then I go ahead and do it. Like I psyched myself out.
Yes, shit. Oops, sorry! Sorry. It's just I told myself I wasn't going to say Pope Alexander and sound like a dope and then I go ahead and do it. Like I psyched myself out.
It's no big deal.
It's no big deal.
You are such a sweetheart.
That's lovely.
Really? I thought it was appropriate maybe. That's all. I really admire the work that you do. I know it's not proper to be so familiar but I guess since we're outside the workplace I feel a certain liberty to --

It's fine, Mary. I'm happy to hear it.
It's fine, Mary. I'm happy to hear it.
Okay. Good. Great. Thanks. I like you, Howard... an awful lot. Is that terrible?
I've loved you for a very long time. I'm sorry! I shouldn't have said that.
I've got a wife, Mary. Kids. You know that.
I've got a wife, Mary. Kids. You know that.
I wish I was your wife. I wish I had your kids.
We can't do this.
No you're right. Once again. You're a decent man, Howard.
What, Howard?
We... have a history. I'm sorry. You wanted the procedure. You wanted it done... to get past. I have to finish in there. It's almost morning. We'll talk later.
Thanks. So... do we talk about this... or what?
I don't know what I'm supposed say, Mary. I want to do the right thing here.
I don't know what I'm supposed say, Mary. I want to do the right thing here.
Do you love me? Did you love me? Something. I listened to my tape. I can't believe I've been sitting right in front of it for a year. It's like listening to someone else's story. I mean, I hear myself talking about having sex with you and I can't even imagine you naked. I can't even say "naked" to you!

Ah, your journal. This will be invaluable.
December 15th, 2004. I met someone tonight. Oh, Christ: I don't know what to do. Her name is Clementine and she's amazing. So alive and spontaneous and passionate and sensitive. Things with Naomi and I have been stagnant for so long.
Mary. What are you doing here?
She came to help, Howard.
I tried that already.
Did you try going through C-Gate?
Did you try going through C-Gate?
Yeah. Of course.
You get some sleep, Howard. I'll take it from here.
Yeah, probably a good idea.
Howard, they've disappeared again.
Oh dear.
I'll go out for a smoke. If no one minds.
That's fine, Stan.
So, I've got to drop the van off.
Thanks, Stan. Thanks.
She should not have done this, Stan. As mad as she was... as justifiably --
I don't know what you're talking about, Howard.

This book -- It's essential that people read it because -- -- It's the truth. And only I know it.
Maybe after the holidays then.
The voltage looks fine.
Then check the connections.
Does that help?
Yeah, that looks better. Thanks.
It's an apartment.
Not a dump, then, but kind of plain. Uninspired. And there's a stale smell. Sort of stuffy. I don't know. Stuffy.

Save your breath for the climb.
But I don't know how to polka.
Neither do I... ha ha ho ho hee hee.
What was that?
Clockworks.
Clockworks.
Clockworks?
The Clockworks is one reason that I am here on Siwash Ridge. I accepted the invitation to be initiated as a shaman by an aged Siwash chief who was the principle outside confederate of the Clock People.
Siwash, huh?
Siwash, huh?
He was a degenerated warlock who could turn urine into beer, and the honor that he extended me gave me rights of occupancy in this sacred cave on this far-away Siwash Ridge. I came to the Dakota hills to construct a clockworks of my own.
But unlike the clockworks of the Clock People, my ticks more accurately echo the ticks of the universe.... ......ha ha ho ho and hee hee.
The Clock People?
During the Second World War I busted out of Tule Lake detention camp; as a Japanese-American, I had been put there and watched over. I found refuge with the Clock People, who discovered me in a snow bank, near dead, I had been climbing across the Sierra Nevada mountains.
Then if you are Japanese, then why are you called the Chink?
Then if you are Japanese, then why are you called the Chink?
The Clock People mistook me for Chinese. And the name stuck. In the same way that all Indian tribes came to be labeled "Indians" through the ignorance of an Italian sailor with a taste for oranges, it is only fitting that "Indians" misnamed me. The Clock People, however, are not a tribe, rather they are a gathering of Indians from various tribes. They have
What do you believe in then?
Ha ha ho ho and hee hee.

The Countess has come to our aid. The Rubber Rose Ranch is officially deeded to all the cowgirls. And I have been asked to oversee the ranch. For $300 a week. And as it turns out, the Countess is not going to be the vegetable the doctors thought he was... here's a picture!
I want to go back to the Clock People. I kind of miss those fool redskins and wonder what they're up to. What's happened to Jelly?
She had a one way-ticket to Kansas City.
She had a one way-ticket to Kansas City.
You mean she's dead?
But that's an old story now...... I can't believe that you would leave the Butte.
Easy come, easy go.
Well, if the Clock People give you any inside information on the end of the world, drop us a postcard.
The world isn't going to end, you dummy; I hope you know that much. But it is going to change. It's going to change drastically, and probably in your lifetime. The Clock People see calamitous earthquakes as the agent of change, and they may be right, since there are a hundred thousand earthquakes a year and major ones are long overdue. But there are
Suppose that you bear five or six children with your characteristics. All in Siwash Cave. In a postcatastrophe world, your offspring would of necessity intermarry, forming in time a tribe. A tribe every member of which had giant thumbs. A tribe of Big Thumbs would relate to the environment in very special ways. It could not use weapons or produce sophisticated tools. It would
How am I going to be the progenitor of a tribe when I'm living on an isolated ridgetop with Delores?

That's your problem.
Where do you live, Miss Hankshaw?
I'm staying with the Countess.
I'm staying with the Countess.
I know, but where do you reside when you aren't visiting New York?
I know, but where do you reside when you aren't visiting New York?
I don't.
I don't.
You don't?
You don't?
Well, no, I don't reside anywhere in particular. I just keep moving.
A traveler, eh?
You might say that, although I don't think of it as traveling.
Where are the others?
Oh, Rupert and Carla had a little hassle and went home.
Welcome, podner. By God, it's great to have you here. It's an honor. Sorry I took so long getting to you, but we've had a mess of hard work these past few days -- and a heap of planning to do.
Er, you seem to know who I am, and maybe even what I am. Thanks for the breakfast.
Er, you seem to know who I am, and maybe even what I am. Thanks for the breakfast.
Oh, I know about Sissy Hankshaw, all right. I've done a little hitchhiking myself. Ah shucks, that's like telling Annie Oakley you're a sharpshooter because you once knocked a tomato can off a stump with a fieldstone. I'd heard tales about you from people I'd meet in jail cells and truckstops. I heard about your, uh, your, ah, your wonderful thumbs, and I heard
No, I'm afraid that part isn't true. Jack was in awe of me and tracked me down. We spent a night talking and hugging in a corn field, but he was hardly my lover. Besides, I always travel alone.
Well, that doesn't matter; that part never interested me anyway. The beatnicks were before my time, and I never got anything outta the hippies but bad dope, clichés and the clap. But the example of your life helped me in my struggle to be a cowgirl.
Tell me about it.
About...
About...
About being a cowgirl. What's it all about? When you say the word you make it sound like it was painted in radium on the side of a pearl.

Cowgirls exist as an image. A fairly common image. The idea of cowgirls especially for little girls prevails in our culture. Therefore, it seems to me, the existence of cowgirls should prevail. Otherwise, they're being fooled. In the Rodeo Hall of Fame in Oklahoma City there are just two cowgirls. Two. And both of 'em are trick-riders. Trick-riding is what cowgirls have almost always
You're political, then?
No, ma'am. No way. There's girls on the Rubber Rose who are political, but I don't share their views. I got no cowgirl ideology to expound. "Politics is for people who have a passion for changing life but lack a passion for living it."
Did that last comment sound too profound to be coming outta my mouth? It's not original. It's something I picked up from the Chink.
Really? The Chink, huh? I've gathered that you sometimes speak with him. What else have you learned from the Chink?

Learned from the Chink? Oh my. Ha ha. That's hard to say. We mostly.... Uh, a lot of his talk is pretty goofy.
......Delores zonks out on peyote at least once a week, but so far her Third Vision hasn't happened. Niwetükame, the Mother Goddess has not gotten back in touch with her. Meanwhile she and Debbie are rivaling each other like a couple of crosstown high schools. Tension. Cowgirl tension! What a drag.
What is Debbie's position?
What is Debbie's position?
Debbie says that if women are to take charge again, they must do it in the feminine way; they mustn't resort to aggressive and violent masculine methods. She says it is up to women to show themselves better than men, to love men, set good examples for them and guide them tenderly toward the New Age. She's a real dreamer, that Debbie-dear.

You don't agree with Debbie, then?
You don't agree with Debbie, then?
I wouldn't say that. I expect she's right, ultimately. But I'm with Delores when it comes to fighting for what's mine. I can't understand why Delores is so uptight about the Chink; he could probably teach her a thing or two. Ee! That grass tickles, doesn't it? God knows I love women, but nothing can take the place of a man that fits. Still
That's Jellybean!
FROM MEN, THE WHOOPING CRANE HAS RECEIVED NEITHER LOVE NOR RESPECT. MEN HAVE DRAINED THE CRANE'S MARSHES, STOLEN ITS EGGS, INVADED ITS PRIVACY, POLLUTED ITS FOOD, FOULED ITS AIR, BLOWN IT APART WITH BUCKSHOT.
Looks like every time we get together things are in a mess.
So be it. It looks serious this time, though. All these guns... are you actually prepared to kill and die for whooping cranes?

Hell no, the cranes are wonderful, okay, but I'm not in this for whooping cranes. I'm in it for cowgirls. If we cowgirls give in to authority on this crane issue, then cowgirls become just another compromise. I want a finer fate than that -- for me and for every other cowgirl. Better no cowgirls at all than cowgirls compromised.

How did this business get started, anyhow? Why are the birds nesting here?
No, I guess not.

But the peyote is obviously affecting their brains. It's made them break a migratory pattern that goes back thousands of years.
Every time I tell you that I love you, you flinch. But that's your problem.
If I flinch when you say you love me, it's both our problems. My confusion becomes your confusion. Students confuse teachers, patients confuse psychiatrists, lovers with confused hearts confuse lovers with clear hearts....
Extraordinary!
She's obviously that. Jesus! Which would you rather have, a million dollars or one of Sissy's thumbs full of pennies?

Oh, you! I'm not talking about her hands. They're difficult to ignore, I confess, but I'm speaking of her whole being. Her whole being is extraordinary. The way she talks, for example. She's so articulate.

Ninety degrees to the left, I hope. How does she feel about you?

I think she's disappointed that I'm not more, ah, sort of atavistic. She's got some naive, sentimental notions about Indians. I'm sure she liked me, though; but.... then she left town.

What do they do to you boys in those Ivy league schools, anyway? Strap you down and pump the Nature out of you? They can even press the last drop of Nature out of a Mohawk buck.

If we Ivy Leaguers aren't earthy enough to suit you hillbillies, at least we don't go around indulging in racist terms such as 'Chink.' Next thing I know, you'll be calling me 'chief.'

Aw, he's some old fart holyman who lives in the hills out West. Gives my ranch the creeps and the willies, too. But though he be old and dirty, he's alive, I'll bet, clear down to his toes. They don't have his juice in a jar in New Haven. Well I suppose that I'll have to write Sissy out on the road.
I'm cold.
Here. I'll turn down the air conditioner.

Why? Why do you have to go?

My thumbs hurt. I've made a mistake. I've been negligent. I haven't exercised. I have to hitchhike a little bit every day, no matter what. It's like a musician practicing his scales. When I don't practice, my timing gets off, my thumbs get stiff and sore.
Going north?
You bet your raggedy white ass I am.
Thanks.

When I was younger, I hitchhiked one hundred and twenty-seven hours without stopping, without food or sleep, crossed the continent twice in six days, cooled my thumbs in both oceans and caught rides after midnight on unlighted highways.

Whooee!

As I developed, however, I grew more concerned with subtleties and nuances of style. Time in terms of M.P.H. no longer interested me. I began to hitchhike in something akin to geological time: slow, ancient, vast. When I am really moving, stopping car after car after car, moving so freely, so clearly, so delicately that even the sex maniacs and the cops can only
To my own special Sissy. Cheers! And welcome. So my letter brought ya flying, eh? Where were you? Salt Lake City? La Conner? Well, I may have a little surprise for you. But first, tell me about yourself. It's been six months, hasn't it? In some circles that's half a year. How are you?
Tired...
Tired...
That's the very first time in the eons that I've known you that I've ever heard you complain. And now you're tired, poor darling.

I've always been proud of the way nature singled me out. It's the people who have been deformed by society I feel sorry for. I've been steady moving for eleven years and some months. Maybe I should rest up for a spell, I'm not as young as I used to be.

Does that mean you might have an assignment for me?
You were the Yoni Yum girl from, let's see, from nineteen sixty-eight through nineteen seventy. You've always smelled so nice. Like a little sister. The irony has just killed me. You, the Dew Girl, one of the few girls who doesn't need Dew. I loath the stink of females! They are so sweet the way God made them, then they start fooling around with

She's a young thing who works on my ranch. Real name is Sally Jones or something wooden like that. She's cute as a hot fudge taco, and, of course, it takes verve to change one's name so charmingly. But she stinks like a slut just the same.
Your ranch?
Your ranch?
Oh my dear yes, I bought a little ranch out West, sort of a tribute to the women of America who have cooperated with me in eliminating their odor by using my vaginal products, Dew spray mist and Yoni Yum spray powder. A tax write-off, actually.
Sissy, Sissy, blushing bride, you can desist from wearing paths in those forgotten highways. The Countess has arranged a job for you. And what a job...
A job for me?
A job for me?
I am once more about to make advertising history. And only you, the original Yoni Yum/Dew Girl, could possibly assist me.
