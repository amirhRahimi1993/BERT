The Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday female deodorant sprays may cause such harmful reactions as blisters, burns and rashes. Although the FDA judges that the reported reactions are not sufficient to justify removal of these products from the market, they are sufficient to warrant the proposed mandatory label warnings.
Shit O dear, that's enough to make me asthmatic. The nerve of those twits. What do they know about female odor? Don't interrupt. Here's my concept. My ranch out West? It's a beauty ranch. Oh, it's got a few head of cattle for atmosphere and tax purposes. But it's a beauty ranch, a place where unhappy women -- divorcees and widows, mainly -- can

Now, now. Don't get exasperated. I realize that you've always avoided all but the most rudimentary involvements with men, and I might add, you've been wise. Heterosexual relationships seem to lead only to marriage. For men, marriage is a matter of efficient logistics: The male gets his food, bed, laundry, TV, pussy, offspring and creature comforts all under one roof, where he doesn't have
But here you are, still a virgin -- you are virginal yet, aren't you?

Why, yes, technically. Jack Kerouac and I came awfully close, but he was afraid of me, I think...
Yes, well, what I'm getting at is that there comes a time when it is psychologically impossible for a woman to lose her virginity. She can't wait too long, you know. Now, there's no reason why you must lose yours. I mean, just ponder it a bit, that's all.

Sissy, don't play dumb with me! You're a good model but a shitty actress. The cowgirls are involved in this whooping crane disappearance. You know perfectly well they are. Last seen in Nebraska. Didn't make it to Canada. Siwash Lake is between Nebraska and Canada. The cowgirls have possession of Siwash Lake. And who else but Jellybean's wild cunts could possibly conceive of doing
I don't know anything about it.
I don't know anything about it.
Sissy. You're trying to protect those scuzzy bitches. Well, let your conscience be your guide, as my mommy used to say, but it won't work. Those stinking sluts are going to suffer...
Ballast.
I am your best friend. I am a lifesaver and a heartbreaker...
That means top-secret, Cooper.
I heard it.
I can see why they sent you along.
So if the ship didn't blow up, what happened?
You still need the rope? I thought you were one a those spacemen with ice in ya veins.
I'd rather be on the rope and not need it than need it and not have it. Now step aside, old man.
...do you copy?
Uh, yeah Coop, I'm still here.
Uh, yeah Coop, I'm still here.
Shit! Do not do that! Where the fuck are you?
Shit! Do not do that! Where the fuck are you?
I'm in the Second Containment area. It's pitch black in here. There must have been a coolant leak. Man, this shit is everywhere. I can't see a damn thing.
Holy shit...
Justin?
Justin?
I think I found something...
Time to play Spam in the can.
Don't start with me, Cooper.
Okay, listen up. As you all know by now, we have an addition to our crew. Dr. Weir, this is: Starck, navigation; Smith, pilot, Justin, ship's engineer --
You can call him Baby-bear, he loves that...
You can call him Baby-bear, he loves that...
This is Cooper, what the hell do you do on this ship, anyway?
...cancel our leave and send us out on some bullshit mission...!
EVERYBODY SHUT UP! Let the man speak.
From what?
You're convinced the crew could still be alive? After seven years?
...come on, Skipper, I already put my shoes on...
You've had plenty EVA, Coop, it's Justin's turn. Stay on station. If anything happens...
You've had plenty EVA, Coop, it's Justin's turn. Stay on station. If anything happens...
I'll be all over it.
We have a man down...

Hold on, Coop...
But Justin...
I'll get him.
Captain Miller, we're ready to repressurize the Clark.
On my way.
...and the gravity drive goes where no man has gone before.
You prep the gravity couches. I'm going to manually arm those explosives.
You prep the gravity couches. I'm going to manually arm those explosives.
Will it work?

It worked for Weir. Prep the tanks.
You been out there a long time. Trying to break my record?

You're sucking too much nitrogen in your mix.
We'll have to re-route through the port conduit to the APU.
What about the accumulator...?
It's holding... She's holding...!
We're still venting trace gasses, gimme twenty minutes to plug the hole.
Solid as a rock. Hey, Smith...
Smith, clear that airlock, man, I'm coming in.
Smith, clear that airlock, man, I'm coming in.
Roger that.
Damn, Dr. Weir, don't scare us like that. Coffee?
What?
What?
Coffee.
Coffee.
No, thank you.
The Event Horizon only had life support for eighteen months. It seems impossible, but in light of the transmission... I have to think that someone has managed to endure until now.
Skipper, do we get hazard pay for this?
It was like... nothing was there... and then Justin appeared and the Core... became metal...
No, he didn't.
No, he didn't.
You weren't there. I saw it.
You weren't there. I saw it.
Saw what, Mr. Cooper? What did you really see, because what you're describing is not physically possible...
I don't know what happened to Justin.
I'm telling you, I saw it...
I'm telling you, I saw it...
What you saw could have been an optical effect caused by gravitational distortion.

I know what I saw and it wasn't a fucking "optical effect!"
Is that an offer?
It is not.
What's happening?
I don't know, the screens are dead...!
Let me breathe, let me breathe...
You're okay now, it's over...
How? The Bridge is gone.
There must be a way! What about Engineering?

I don't know the process, Dr. Weir was the expert...
I don't want to go where the last crew went. I'd rather be dead.
I'm gonna activate the emergency beacon.
Hurry.
What...?
Run!
He's a rescue technician. Peters, medical technician. DJ...
Trauma.
Trauma.
And this is mission specialist Dr. William Weir. We all know where we're going. Dr. Weir is going to tell us why.
We haven't tested the air yet. It could be contaminated...
No time. We need whatever's left in our suits to repair the Clark. Like it or not, this is the only oxygen for three billion kilometers.
How is he?
His vitals are stable, but he's unresponsive to stimuli. He might wake up in fifteen minutes. He might not wake up at all.
Carbon dioxide poisoning produces hallucinations, impaired judgement...
Goddammit, DJ, it was not a hallucination! I saw a man, he was on fire. And then he disappeared.
To conserve our oxygen, we should severely restrict our activity. Anyone who can should get some sleep.
I don't need sleep, DJ. I need answers.
He'll live... if we ever make it back.
We'll make it.
Of course not. Justin just climbed into the airlock because he felt like it. Just one of those things. I swore I'd never lose another man. I came close today. Real close.
"Another man?" Who?
I, I tried to go back for him, to save him, but I couldn't get to him in time. The fire... Have you ever seen fire in zero-gravity? It's like a liquid, it slides over everything. It was like a wave breaking over him, a wave of fire. And then he was gone. I never told anyone until now. But this ship knew, DJ.
No.
What is it?
I've been listening to the transmission. And I think Houston made a mistake in the translation.
I've been listening to the transmission. And I think Houston made a mistake in the translation.
Go on.
They thought it said, "Liberatis me," "Save me," but it's not "me." It's "tutemet:" "Save yourself."
It's not a distress call. It's a warning.
It's not a distress call. It's a warning.
It gets worse.
Do you hear it? Right there.
Hear what?

It sounds like "ex infera:" "ex," from; "infera," the ablative case of "inferi." "Hell."

"Save yourself. From Hell." What are you saying, are you saying that this ship is possessed?
"Save yourself. From Hell." What are you saying, are you saying that this ship is possessed?
No. I don't believe in that sort of thing. But if Dr. Weir is right, this ship has passed beyond the boundaries of our universe, of reality. Who knows where this ship has been... What it's seen... And what it's brought back with it.
DJ. The Clark's gone. Smith and Cooper are dead.
What happened?
What happened?
Weir. He used one of the explosives from the Corridor.
Please...
Oh, God, DJ, what do I... how do I...
Oh, God, DJ, what do I... how do I...

Nothing. It's nothing.

You wanted to see me, Admiral?
I apologize for the short notice, Bill, but we've had something come up that requires your immediate attention. Lyle?
Incredible... These are the same coordinates before the ship disappeared... this, this happened? This isn't some kind of hoax?
I wouldn't bring you here on a hoax. Houston confirms the telemetry and I.D. codes.
I wouldn't bring you here on a hoax. Houston confirms the telemetry and I.D. codes.
It's the Event Horizon. She's come back.
That ship was lost in deep space, seven years ago. If the Titanic sailed into New York harbor, I'd find it more plausible. Houston wants Aerospace to send out a search and rescue team, investigate the source of the transmission. If it really is the Event Horizon, they'll attempt a salvage. We need you to prepare a detailed briefing on the ship's systems for
A written briefing can't possibly anticipate the variables on a mission like this. I have to go with them.
It's against my better judgement, but I'll run this by the Man downstairs. You'll know my decision by the end of the day.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Don't thank me, Bill. I'm not doing you any favors.
It's not that simple. Lyle, play the recording for Dr. Weir.
Navigation Control tried to hail the vessel. This was the only response.
You're not seriously considering sending him?
You don't just dismiss Bill Weir. The man held Oppenheimer's chair at Princeton. If the Event Horizon had worked, he would have gone down in history as the greatest mind in physics since Einstein.

The official inquiry blamed Weir's design for the ship's loss.

That doesn't mean a damn thing. They were looking for a scapegoat and Weir fit the bill. But he's not responsible for what happened to the ship.

Some things you don't get over.
I want our best people on this. Where's Miller?
The Lewis and Clark just returned from patrol in the asteroid belt, she's docked in bay four.
What, Justin, what shows you?
It won't stop, it goes on and on and on...
It won't stop, it goes on and on and on...
What does?

The dark inside me.
...It's inside and it eats and eats until there's nothing left.
"The dark inside..."? I don't understand.

From the Other Place...
Oh my god OH MY GOD...
Starck!
...is zero. That's what the singularity does: it folds space, so that point A and point B coexist in the same space and time. After the ship passes through this gateway, space returns to normal. It's called a gravity drive.
How do you know all this?
How do you know all this?
I built it.
You've reached the First Containment Seal. The engineering decks are on the other side.
We still have pressure. The radiation count's steady at 7 millirads an hour.

I'm going in.
Everything green on my boards, Skipper.
Start the countdown.
Okay. We do it the hard way. Deck by deck, room by room. Starck, deploy the umbilicus. I believe you're up for a walk, Mr. Justin. Go get your bonnet on.
Yes, sir!
Justin, finish your sweep.
Almost done, I just gotta check one thing...
Patch me through to him.
Justin.
Justin.
Skipper, you gotta help me...
...I don't want to die...!
You're not going to die! Not today! I want you to do exactly as I say and I'm gonna get you out of there, alright?
You're not going to die! Not today! I want you to do exactly as I say and I'm gonna get you out of there, alright?
But I can't... I gotta get out of here... Skipper, please...
But I can't... I gotta get out of here... Skipper, please...
Justin. I won't let you die.
This is Weir.
Dr. Weir, Admiral Hollis would like to see you as soon as possible.
Dr. Weir, you have no experience with salvage procedures.
I designed the ship's propulsion system. I am the only person capable of evaluating the performance of the gravity drive. You can't send a Search and Rescue team out there alone and expect them to succeed. That would be like... like sending an auto- mechanic to work on the shuttle.

I can understand your desire to redeem your reputation, Dr. Weir, but it doesn't factor into this.
I can understand your desire to redeem your reputation, Dr. Weir, but it doesn't factor into this.
This is not about my reputation! This is not about me at all! The Event Horizon was created for one reason: to go faster than light. Imagine mankind exploring new solar systems, colonizing new worlds. Seven years ago, we didn't just lose the ship and the crew. We lost the dream. I have to go.
Since the initial transmission, there's been no further contact. Just the beacon, every two minutes.
The crew? Could they still be alive?
The crew? Could they still be alive?
The ship had life support systems for eighteen months. They're been gone seven years.

No, no, its alright. I talked to my ex, he'll keep Denny over Christmas and I'll get him this summer. Goddam it, Skipper... I haven't seen him in two months.
No, no, its alright. I talked to my ex, he'll keep Denny over Christmas and I'll get him this summer. Goddam it, Skipper... I haven't seen him in two months.
I am sorry. But now we have to go to work.
We've got pressure.
Clear and open on my mark. Three... two... one... mark.
Jesus its huge.
Ice crystals everywhere. This place is a deep freeze.
That means they didn't abandon ship.
So where are they? Starck, any luck with the bio-scan?
Peters is right, no one's here.
I don't know, this place is really dark, I can't see a thing...
I can see the hatch.
Starck, you still showing those readings?
The blood came from somewhere, Peters...
There's no one here, Skipper.
Okay. I'm on the bridge.
What you got, Peters?
Everything's been shut down. Conserving power, I guess. Green light on the hull, it's intact.
The science workstation has power, I'll see if I can find the crew from here.
I found one.
Alive?
Alive?
Frozen.
Justin, check the containment for radiation leaks. Peters...
...how's the client?
...how's the client?
Crystallized.
Can anybody hear me...
Skipper...
Skipper...
Peters...
Peters...
...you okay?
...you okay?
Yeah. I'm -- I'm okay.
Peters, I want you to go through the ship's log, see if we can't find some answers.
I can use the station in Medical, keep an eye on Justin...
I can use the station in Medical, keep an eye on Justin...
Fine. Starck, I want you to repeat the bio-scan...
I can run the image through a series of filters, try to clean it up.
Do it.
That's a negative, Starck.
Justin.
Peters. We need to know what happened to the crew. Before it happens to us.
I'll get back to the log. But on the bridge, I won't go back, back in there...
I'll get back to the log. But on the bridge, I won't go back, back in there...
Thanks.
Captain Miller, I just want to say...
The clock is running, Dr. Weir. If you'll follow the rest of the crew, they'll show you to the gravity tanks.
Captain Miller, I appreciate this opportunity...
Doctor Weir, my crew is not going on your mission because we want to. We were pulled off a well deserved leave, to be sent out to the middle of nowhere, and no one's even told us why.
Doctor Weir, my crew is not going on your mission because we want to. We were pulled off a well deserved leave, to be sent out to the middle of nowhere, and no one's even told us why.

I've been authorized to brief you and the crew once we reach Neptune space.
Until then, do what you're told and stay out of my way.
It was the ship's maiden voyage, to test the drive. The Event Horizon moved to safe distance using ion thrusters. They received the go-ahead to activate the gravity drive. And the ship vanished from all our scopes. No radar contact, no enhanced optical, no radio contact of any kind. They disappeared without a trace. Until now.
Where has it been for the last seven years?
Where has it been for the last seven years?
That's what we're here to find out.
What does it say?
NSA encryption specialists have deciphered some of the message...
That's the engineering containment. And there's the main airlock. We can dock there.
Smith, use the arm and lock us onto that antennae cluster.
Smith, use the arm and lock us onto that antennae cluster.
Be careful. It's not a load bearing structure...
Dr. Weir, I need you on the bridge.
Captain, I didn't come out here to sit on your bridge, I need to be on that ship...
Captain, I didn't come out here to sit on your bridge, I need to be on that ship...
Once the ship is secured, we'll bring you on board --

You're in the central corridor. It connects the personnel areas to Engineering.
Peters and I will search the forward decks. Justin, take Engineering. No hot-dogging, not on this one, alright?
I can see that, what're they for?
In an emergency, the charges detonate in series, destroying the central section and separating the personnel areas from the rest of the ship. That way, if the gravity drive malfunctions, the crew could use the foredecks as a lifeboat.
Easy, Peters, we're okay, we're okay. Let's finish the sweep.
Captain Miller, the foredecks are just ahead.
Any survivors?
Negative.
No one?
They're empty, Dr. Weir. Moving forward.
It beats dying, Mister Smith.
Dr. Weir's right. Get on board the Event Horizon. I'll meet you at the airlock.
Yes.
One of my men is down. I want to know what happened to him.
Hold on, what's this "gravitational distortion?"
It's possible that a burst of gravity waves escaped from the Core, distorting space-time. They could be what hit the Lewis and Clark.

How much time do you need? We have seventeen hours and forty-two minutes. Now: what is in the Core?

I want this room sealed. The Second Containment is off limits.
There's no danger. The black hole is contained behind three magnetic fields, it's under control.
There's no danger. The black hole is contained behind three magnetic fields, it's under control.
Your black hole damn near ripped my ship apart. It may have killed one of my men. No one goes near that thing.
You have something, Dr. Weir?

What about it?

The Event Horizon's computer think's it's 2034.
The Event Horizon's computer think's it's 2034.
It's 2041...
It's 2041...
Exactly. The ship's internal clock is off by seven years.
Explanation?
Intense gravitational fields effect the passage of time, it's possible... Black holes make sense on paper, it's all math, you see, but as to what really happened... The Event Horizon has passed beyond our plane of reality, and like Lazarus, returned from the dead.
What the hell is that? Dr. Weir?
I don't know.
We barely have enough power for life support as it is, if we can't stop the drain, we're not gonna make it.
The Core...!
We don't get the power back, our air's gonna go bad.
Check the Core for radiation. Carbon dioxide may be the least of our worries.
We're a long way from home and we're in a bad place. Let's not make it worse. If anyone has any constructive suggestions, now is the time.
I think I can stabilize the fields around the singularity, that should prevent another power drain.
I think I can stabilize the fields around the singularity, that should prevent another power drain.
Do it.
Is that your "expert opinion?" The only answer we've had out of you is "I don't know."
Justin just tried to kill himself. The man is clearly insane.
I want to know what caused that noise. I want to know why one of my crew tried to throw himself out of the airlock.
Thermal changes in the hull could have caused the metal to expand and contract very suddenly, causing reverberations --

Maybe you're right. But it's still my command, and I have leeway to abort when I feel there is an unacceptable threat to my crew. And I think there is. Starck, download all the files from the Event Horizon's computers. Coop, Smith, finish moving the CO2 scrubbers back onto the Clark.

If you miss me, you'll blow out the hull. You'll die too.
What makes you think I'll miss?
Weir is dead.
Then who the fuck are you?
Then who the fuck are you?
Your fear. Do you remember the Goliath, Miller?
What are you?
You know.
You know.
You want me to believe you're the Devil, well, I don't, that's bullshit!
You want me to believe you're the Devil, well, I don't, that's bullshit!
I'm not the Devil.
I'm not the Devil.
Then what, what are you? Tell me...
Then what, what are you? Tell me...
Better if I just show you.
There is no Devil. There is no God. There is only... NOTHING.
You're lying...!
You're lying...!
I'm not asking you to believe me. You'll see for yourself... and so will your crew. You're all coming with me.
I'm not asking you to believe me. You'll see for yourself... and so will your crew. You're all coming with me.
Starck... Cooper...
You can't have them. Go to hell.
NOOO!
I don't like it either, but you know the rules: we get the call, we go. Is the course locked in?
Locked and cocked.
Jesus...
What is that?
Heading three-three-four...
...Make your approach vector negative fourteen degrees...
...Make your approach vector negative fourteen degrees...
One-four degrees...
We have a lock on the Event Horizon's navigation beacon. It's in the upper ionosphere, we're in for some chop.
Bring us in tight. Starck, get on the horn, see if anyone's listening...
We're all on edge, Smith. We're a long way out...
That's not it. That ship was built to go faster than light... That's just wrong, it goes against everything we know...
That's not it. That ship was built to go faster than light... That's just wrong, it goes against everything we know...
What are you trying to say? "If God had intended Man to fly, he would have given us wings?"
What are you trying to say? "If God had intended Man to fly, he would have given us wings?"
Something like that, yeah.
I guess we're about to find out. Keep us slow and steady.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Dr. Weir...!
We've got some weather.
I noticed. Starck, anybody home?
1500 meters. We're getting too close...
Where is it?
Proximity warning! 900, 800 meters, 700... we're right on top of it, we're gonna hit!
Starck...
Put it through TACS. Smith, you up for a flyby?
Love to.
It is now. We're locked in.
Starck, give me a read.
Captain Miller...
Smith, where the hell have you been?!
Smith, where the hell have you been?!
We have a situation here...
Do we have enough time for a weld?
We don't have time to fart.
We don't have time to fart.
We're losing pressure at 280 liters a second and our oxygen tanks are cracked. In three minutes, our atmosphere will be gone. We are fucking dead.

No one's dying on my watch, Smith! What about the reserve tanks?
No one's dying on my watch, Smith! What about the reserve tanks?
They're gone.
But...
You heard me, Smith. Peters, are you with me?
Captain Miller, you copy?
I'm here, Smith, how's the Clark?
I'm here, Smith, how's the Clark?
I've found a six inch fracture in the outer hull. We should be able to repair it and re-pressurize, it's gonna take some time.

We don't have time, Smith. In twenty hours we run out of air.
We don't have time, Smith. In twenty hours we run out of air.
Understood.
...you break all the laws of physics, you think there won't be a price? You already killed the first crew...
That's enough!
Sir.
Get outside, go back to work. I'll join you shortly.
Thank you.
Captain, we got a problem.
Captain, we got a problem.
Now what?
Now what?
She was right behind me, I turn around, she's gone. She could be anywhere.
She was right behind me, I turn around, she's gone. She could be anywhere.
Alright. Prep the Clark for launch. I'll find her.
Skipper...
What is it, Smith?
What is it, Smith?
I just saw Weir, I think he was messing around on the Clark.
Smith, get out of there...
Come again, Skipper?
Come again, Skipper?
One of the explosives is missing from the corridor. I think Weir may have put it on the Clark.
Get off the Clark now and wait for me at the airlock.
No, no, we just got her back together...
No, no, we just got her back together...
Get out of there now!
Where is it, where is it...
Smith? Smith! Fuck!
We're past the outer marker, we can engage the ion drive whenever you're ready.
Justin?
Ion drive will engage in... T-minus ten minutes.
Let's go.
Starck, why aren't you on the bridge?
I just finished drying...
I just finished drying...
Then what are you doing here? Come on, people, let's go! And Cooper... Put some pants on.
Crossing the horizon. Optimum approach angle is fourteen degrees.
Come around to three-three-four...
Something's wrong with the bio-scan.
Radiation interference?
Radiation interference?
There's not enough radiation to throw off the scan. I'm picking up trace life forms, but I can't get a lock on the location.
That's an affirmative.
Keep your eyes open.
Everybody okay?
We're all here.
We're all here.
Okay. Let's find out how much time we just bought.
It tastes bad.
But you can breathe it.
The antennae array's completely fried, we've got no radio, no laser, no highgain... No one's going to be coming to help us.
How much oh-two do we have?
How much oh-two do we have?
Oxygen is not the problem.
Oxygen is not the problem.
Carbon dioxide?
Carbon dioxide?
It's building up with every breath we take. And the CO2 filters on the Event Horizon are shot.
It's building up with every breath we take. And the CO2 filters on the Event Horizon are shot.
We can take the filters from the Clark...
We can take the filters from the Clark...
I thought of that, with the filters from the Clark, we've got enough breathable air for twenty hours. After that, we'd better be on our way home.

What about the life readings you picked up?
What about the life readings you picked up?
The Event Horizon sensors show the same thing: "Bio-readings of indeterminate origin." Right before that wave hit the Clark, there was some kind of surge, right off the scale, but now it's back to its previous levels.

What's causing the readings?
What's causing the readings?
I don't know, but whatever it is, it's not the crew.
I don't know, but whatever it is, it's not the crew.
So where is the rest of the crew? We've been over every inch of this ship and all we've found is blood. Dr. Weir? Any suggestions?
What's the point? I'll just get the same thing...
Not acceptable. I want to know what's causing those readings. If the crew is dead, I want the bodies, I want the crew found.
Not acceptable. I want to know what's causing those readings. If the crew is dead, I want the bodies, I want the crew found.
I can reconfigure the scan for C-12, amylase proteins.
I can reconfigure the scan for C-12, amylase proteins.
Do it. Dr. Weir...
Maybe one of the original crew?
No. It was someone else.
No. It was someone else.
Who?
Who?
Dr. Weir, you were right there, you must have heard something, seen something...
Miller...
What is it, Starck?
What is it, Starck?
...I ran the bio-scan with the DNA/RNA filter. The results were bio-readings of indeterminate origin...
...I ran the bio-scan with the DNA/RNA filter. The results were bio-readings of indeterminate origin...
"...bio-readings of indeterminate origin," don't you have anything useful to tell me?
"...bio-readings of indeterminate origin," don't you have anything useful to tell me?
I've got a theory.
Go ahead.
There was a another surge in the bio- readings right before you... you saw what you saw. We picked up a similar readings right before the Clarke was damaged. What if there were a connection between the two? The gravity waves, the hallucination, all part of an defensive reaction, like an immune system...
You've got to listen...
To what? What are you saying? This ship is alive?
To what? What are you saying? This ship is alive?
I didn't say that, I said the bio- readings correspond to what happened to you, the ship is reacting to us...
I didn't say that, I said the bio- readings correspond to what happened to you, the ship is reacting to us...
We're hanging on by our fingernails and you're giving me bullshit stories...
It's not bullshit, it's the only conclusion the data supports...
Starck, do you know how crazy that sounds? It's impossible.
Starck, do you know how crazy that sounds? It's impossible.
I know that.
If you knew it was impossible, then why'd you waste my time?
I thought you wanted an answer. And that's the only one I have.
What I want is to survive the next ten hours.
Nine hours and twenty-two minutes.
Nine hours and twenty-two minutes.
I'm going outside to work on the Clark. And Starck... don't tell anyone what you just told me. We've got enough to worry about.
Miller, come in...
What's going on in there, Starck?
What's going on in there, Starck?
Justin's in the airlock.
What?
He's awake, he's in the airlock, he's not wearing a suit.
He's awake, he's in the airlock, he's not wearing a suit.
Stay here! Don't stop working!
I'm on my way, Starck.
You better hurry. He's engaged the override, we can't open the inner door.
Tuck yourself into a crouched position, shut your eyes as tight as you can!
Five seconds.
Weir can't be alive.
Whatever was on that bridge wasn't Weir.
Weir activated the drive. He's sending us to the Other Place.
We've got to shut it down, we've got to...
BLOW THE FUCKER UP.
Blow it up?
Blow it up?
We blow the Corridor. Use the foredecks as a lifeboat, separate it from the rest of the ship. We stay put...
I'll do it --
No. I'll be right back.
We're armed. This fucker's ready to blow...
...repeat, we're armed...
...repeat, we're armed...
Miller, he's back, he was in the tank...
Weir.
He's dead...
First time in a grav couch?
Yes.
Don't worry about it. He's hard, but he's fair. You're lucky to be shipping out with him. He's one of the few Captains in the service with experience in the Outer Reach.
He's been past Mars?
He's been past Mars?
He served on the Goliath.
He served on the Goliath.
Wasn't that ship destroyed?
Wasn't that ship destroyed?
They attempted to rescue a supply shuttle bound for Titan. The shuttle's oh-two tanks ruptured during the rescue, flooded both ships with pure oxygen. There was a spark and both ships were incinerated. The Skipper and three others just made it to a lifeboat. Captain Miller was able...
Claire...
DJ! It's okay. You're okay. Just breathe.
Here's another one. They're all over the place.
They're explosive charges.
Dr. Weir, what's this the door to?
You're at the Bridge, Ms. Peters. You still haven't seen any crew?
Yes, we can see some kind of mist. What is that?
Blood. Looks like arterial spray.
Blood. Looks like arterial spray.
Can you see a body?
Can you see a body?
There's no one here.
No. I saw nothing.
I did.
About an hour ago. In medical. I saw my son. He was lying on one of the examination tables and his legs were...
Isn't it possible that you were traumatized by finding the body on the bridge?
Isn't it possible that you were traumatized by finding the body on the bridge?
I've seen bodies before. This is different.
There's no one in the corridor but us.
Not according to the computer.
He's engaged the override.
Can you shut it down?
Yes. Yes, Justin, we heard it.
Keep him talking.
Keep him talking.
Do you know what it was?
Almost got it.
Come on, Baby-bear, open this door...
We have to do something, oh God...
Skipper, Justin just activated the door. It's on a thirty second delay...
You got any coffee?
It's cold.
It's cold.
I don't care.
Hey...
Say this paper represents space-time, and you want to get from "point A" here... ...to "point B," here. Now: what's the shortest distance between two points?
Where is she?
Dead ahead, 5000 meters.
Jesus, that is one big ugly fat fucker...
She's not ugly.
Foredecks. Crew quarters, bridge, medical and science labs, hydroponics, what have you. That central section connects the forward decks to the Engineering containment area. Can we move in closer?
Shit, Doc, any closer and we're gonna need a rubber...
What the hell is that?
That's the Core: the gravity drive. The heart of the ship.
The safety circuit's failed!
We're losing atmosphere...
What?
It still has air and reserve power, we can activate gravity and life support.
I didn't see anything and I don't have to see anything. This ship is fucked.
Thank you for that scientific analysis, Mister Smith.
Thank you for that scientific analysis, Mister Smith.
Hey! You don't need to be a scientist figure it out...
I can't believe this, I haven't gotten more than my hand in six weeks and now this shit. Why not Mars, Cap, Mars has women...
Smith's right. Neptune? There's nothing out there. If something happens, we'll be on our own.
30 hours to Neptune orbit.
All boards are green, everything's five by five.
You can't do that.
The law of relativity prohibits faster- than-light travel...
This is U.S. Aerospace Command vessel Lewis and Clark, hailing Event Horizon, Event Horizon, do you read...? This is the Lewis and Clark, hailing...
Matching speed... now. Range to target ten thousand meters and closing... Skipper, I got a bad feeling about this...
If they are, they're screening their calls.
Range 3000 meters and closing.
The scope is lit, it's right in front of us...
1000 meters...
Range 500 meters and holding. Turbulence is dropping off...
Picking up magnetic interference.
What happened to his eyes?
Explosive decompression.
Explosive decompression.
Decompression wouldn't do that.
Miller, do you read me, Peters --
Get them back --
Get them back --
I'm trying, goddammit --
What if the air has gone bad? We can't wear these suits forever.
I don't think this is a good idea, we don't even know what happened on that ship...
Relativity, yes. We can't break the law of relativity, but we can go around it. The ship doesn't really move faster than the speed of light; it creates a dimensional gateway that allows the ship to instantaneously "jump" from one point in the universe to another, light years away.
How?
How?
Well, in layman's terms, you use a rotating magnetic field to focus a narrow beam of gravitons; these in turn fold space-time consistent with Weyl tensor dynamics until the space- time curvature becomes infinitely large and you have a singularity...
A straight line.
Wrong. The shortest distance between two points...
The reactor's still hot. We've got several small radiation sources, leaks probably. Nothing serious.
Do they have pressure?
Do they have pressure?
Affirmative. The hull's intact... but there's no gravity and the thermal units are off line. I'm showing deep cold. The crew couldn't survive unless they were in stasis.
Could it be the crew? If they were in suspended animation, wouldn't that effect the scan?
If they were in stasis, I'd get a location, but these readings, they're all over the ship. It doesn't make any sense.
What is it?
Ship's log.
What is it?
I don't know. The life readings just went off the scale.
That's how the gravity drive works, you see: it focuses the black hole's immense gravitational power to create the gateway. That's how the Event Horizon travels faster than light.
I can't believe we built this.
Why Dr. Weir, I think you're in love.
Hmmm. Claire used to tell me I loved the Event Horizon more than I loved her. I told her that wasn't true, I just knew the Event Horizon better, that's all.
Hmmm. Claire used to tell me I loved the Event Horizon more than I loved her. I told her that wasn't true, I just knew the Event Horizon better, that's all.
Claire is your wife?
Claire is your wife?
Yes.
Yes.
It must be hard, being so far away from her.
It must be hard, being so far away from her.
Yes. I miss her. She died. Two years now.
Yes. I miss her. She died. Two years now.
I'm sorry.
Maybe a power interruption crashed the system...
No, there's no evidence of a surge or spike of any kind. It's as if time just... stopped for seven years.
What are you doing?
It wants me. I have to go.
In our current environment, Dr. Weir, self-control is an asset.
I'm alright. Please.
What is it?
The forward airlock.
The forward airlock.
Miller, Smith, Cooper, any of you in the airlock?
Justin said something about, "The dark inside me..." What did he mean?
It means nothing.
I don't think She's real big on hate.
You wouldn't say that, if you could see me.
Such a sad face... You know, sometimes being different isn't a bad thing.
Trust me, this ain't one of those times.
How'd you know it was me?
I'm blind, not deaf. Wanna come in?
I'm not really dressed for a party.
Relax, it's casual.
Relax, it's casual.
No, I mean... I'm a little... dusty...
Those yours too?
My step-dad's. I'm strictly into stone. I was wondering when you'd walk by.
We're going to have to work on your touch.
I like the sound of that.
You know, you could'a run an ad in the personals.
"Sensual blind chick seeks three- ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."
"Sensual blind chick seeks three- ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."
This ain't permanent. My friend Reed's working on a cure... I think.
You don't know what it's like out there. Walking around like some kind of circus freak. People staring, whispering --
I wouldn't know anything about that.
I wouldn't know anything about that.
I mean...
I mean...
Tell me. When you grew up in Brooklyn, how many astronauts did you know? You went your own way then. You didn't listen to people. So why start now...?
Way to not overthink it. So when do we leave?
I'll schedule the launch. Call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew.
I can handle the ship. I can even handle Mr. Blonde Ambition. But I don't know if I should be flying or playing Vegas in these suits. Who the hell came up with them?
Victor did.
We can monitor the cloud's approach and observe the tests from here.
Is it safe?
I can only stay for one drink, Ben. I've got to meet with Victor.
Wouldn't want to keep Vic waiting.
We need to give you a physical, so we know what got zapped.
Well why didn't you say so? You want me to lift some weights or something?
You look like an eighties rock band.
The suit will stretch. You should try it --
The suit will stretch. You should try it --
I wouldn't be caught dead in that.
He didn't.
Oh, he did.
Oh, he did.
What did he do to the uniform?!
He didn't mean it. You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead --
It's not him. It's them. I can't live like this.
It's not him. It's them. I can't live like this.
Just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one --
Just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one --
It's easy for you to be patient.
It's easy for you to be patient.
No, it's not. I thought I was done waiting for Reed... We're all in this together now, Ben.
Where is Reed?
Victor must've taken him.
What are you doing here?
I'm worried about you.
I'm worried about you.
About me? How sweet.
About me? How sweet.
Come on. Let me buy you something to eat. Looks like you could use the company.
Ben, come in.
What is this? Where's Reed?
What is this? Where's Reed?
Where do you think? With Sue.
What do you want, Vic?
To help you. I've run every test known to man. And they all yield the same result: the machine is ready.
Reed said it'd be weeks till --
He also said we'd avoid that storm in space. And we know how that turned out.
He couldn't generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass. Yet another mistake for "Mr. Fantastic."
And you can? Power it up?
I'll be watching over you.
Just get back soon, or I start looking for a new groom.
Soon as I'm back, I'm gonna trade that in for a bigger rock.
I don't care about rocks, I care about you. You bring him back in one piece, or you can forget being Best Man.
Deb... It's me. I need you to step out front.
Out front? You home, baby? I got a surprise for you.
Ben?
Don't come any closer for a sec. This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said "together forever no matter what"?
Don't come any closer for a sec. This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said "together forever no matter what"?
Baby, you're scaring me.
Oh my G-g-g. What did you... do to Ben?
Deb, it's me. It's still me.
What did you wish for, honey?
I already got it. Everything I want.
Good thing it ain't workin... Reed, what are we doing here? This guy's fast-food, strip-mall science --
This wasn't our first stop, in case you forgot NASA. And Victor's not that bad. He's just a little... Larger than life.
He's financed some of the biggest breakthroughs of this century.
You'd never know it.
I can't take this.
Ben. This is business. Just work.
What about his first born?
Ben, the money's not important. We could save lives.
He knew about NASA. What if he made the call to shut us down --
Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works --
Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works --
Maybe you should think about yourself for once. You always let this guy push you round --
Maybe you should think about yourself for once. You always let this guy push you round --
We got what we wanted. That's enough.
We got what we wanted. That's enough.
I know, I know. I'm just worried about what he wants... Speaking of which...
Can't do it. I cannot do it.
External SRBs, orbital system engines. Its just like the shuttles you flew in --
External SRBs, orbital system engines. Its just like the shuttles you flew in --
No. I cannot take orders from that underwear model. That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight simulator.
No. I cannot take orders from that underwear model. That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight simulator.
Youthful high spirits.
They crashed it into a wall. A flight simulator.
I'm sure he's matured since then.
When have I asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do?
Five times.
Five times.
I had it at four.
I had it at four.
This makes five.
Isn't that your speech?
He's made a few changes.
He's made a few changes.
This is your dream, Reed. You should be the one up there.
This is your dream, Reed. You should be the one up there.
Victor's better at these things.
The shields on the station should protect us.
Should?
I ain't done arranging your flowers, egghead.
Ben. This is serious. Turn around.
How long was I out?
Three days. I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
Three days. I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
Solid.
I don't know. I just keep going over and over the numbers.
Reed. Even you can't compute every little thing.
Reed. Even you can't compute every little thing.
I should have done more, run more tests --
You go through something like this, makes you appreciate having the right woman in your life.
Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --
Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --
Reed, I'm not talking about Debbie.
What? Come on. She's got a good thing with Victor --
I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
He's smart, powerful, successful --
He's smart, powerful, successful --
Well maybe you should date him.
Are you alright?
I think I need to lie down. Bad shrimp.
What the --!
Ben. Are you okay?
Ben. Are you okay?
Am I okay?! You wanna explain that?!
We had a tough year.
Yeah, nine years straight.
You got a chisel round here?
If we're going to identify the source of the mutation, we need to isolate your recombinant DNA so we can activate positional genomes.
Okay. I've uh, got some questions, from Sue. That she thought might be better coming from me... Can you, you know, go to the bathroom... like normal...
Yeah. You don't wanna know the details.
Yeah. You don't wanna know the details.
Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
O-kay. We'll skip that question.
It's about to be a broken face.
This isn't permanent, Johnny. We need to be careful until we're normal again.
Ben --
Oh, you remember my name do you? You happen to remember what you swore to do with every breath in your body?
Oh, you remember my name do you? You happen to remember what you swore to do with every breath in your body?
We're working as hard as we can --
We're working as hard as we can --
Yeah. I can tell. Victor was right.
Glad "nothing" could take you away from your work.
Ben, I don't know if this thing'll change us back or make us worse. I need you to be patient for a little while longe--
Time for your lesson, Vic. Chem 101: what happens when you supercool hot metal...? Ben...
Got it, teach.
Ben, I've been crunching the numbers on the machine. I think if we can rework the power settings...
Forget it, egghead. I'm good as is.
What the hell you smiling at? Just keep your mouth shut, and your mind on those SMBs --
Actually, the engines are SMEs. Hydrogenbase, carbon propellant. Couple generations past your last ride. I'm not as dumb as you look.
If you behave, maybe next time daddy'll let you drive.
Keep talking, there won't be a next time.
Please tell me your dawg's not trying to rekindle things with my sister.
'Course not. Strictly business.
'Course not. Strictly business.
Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.
Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.
Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God? Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp. Hmmm, it's a toss-up.

Don't you wander off, boy.
Where... where am I?
Back on Earth. Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.
Back on Earth. Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.
Reed?... Sue?

They're fine. Everybody else... is fine.
What's wrong with me?
I swear to you they've done everything humanly possible. The best plastic surgeons in the world, Ben. You had the best --
I swear to you they've done everything humanly possible. The best plastic surgeons in the world, Ben. You had the best --
Give me a mirror...
They said that's not such a good idea, the shock alone could --
Give me the god damn mirror!
Hey! That's a prototype!
Go back to the drawing board.
The machine works. And Vic's gone Mister Hyde on us --
Really? With a name like Von Doom? Never saw that one coming.
No more cracks about how I look.
Hey, I'm Mr. Sensitivity now. Clear the way, wide load coming through.
Your tissue, your organs, your entire biophysical structure is changing. Every system is still functioning, somehow --
And they're changing into...
And they're changing into...
I don't really know. A compound organic-metallic alloy. Stronger than titanium or carbon steel. Harder than diamonds --
I don't really know. A compound organic-metallic alloy. Stronger than titanium or carbon steel. Harder than diamonds --
Like the shields Reed said would protect us. How long?

At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
What do you mean "complete"?
What do you mean "complete"?
I wish I could tell you. I can't pretend to know what we're dealing with here. I'll notify the CDC and --
What?
The Center for Disease Control. If this thing is contagious --
But... this disease... is progressive... degenerative...
That's terrible news...
And where do we think we're going?
I don't know if "we've" noticed, but the sickest runs this side of the Alps are right outside that window --
You're hot!
So are you!
So are you!
I mean, you feel a little feverish.
I mean, you feel a little feverish.
I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
Meet me at 4:01, top of the run. That'll give you a minute to freshen up.
Me like-y.
Stay right. Left is trouble.
Stay right. Left is trouble.
I though we went over this.
I though we went over this.
Last one down springs for room service.
You're on fire!
Not this again --
Not this again --
No: You're ON FIRE!
Victor's right. Johnny, get to the command center. Close the shields.
What about you?
He's not responsive --
Ben! Ben!
Now what is up with that?
The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.
The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.
Cool. What'd it do to you guys?
Oh, you dawg you. Better not be my nurse!
Ben, are you there?
This is wrong in so many ways.
You've been working out.
Ben Grimm is a genuine American hero who's been through a terrible orde--
What he's trying to say is: every team needs a mascot...
Twenty? From outside the place looks a lot taller.
Oh, it is.
We should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes...
This place is deluxe. You got cable?
This place is deluxe. You got cable?
...and figure out how to reverse them. Let me show you to your rooms.
Back it down, Johnny!
I can go hotter!
Not only could you kill yourself, but you could set fire to Earth's atmosphere and destroy all human life as we know it.
Gotcha. Okay. Supernova bad.
Is there something about flames? About flaming, that you --
What are you trying to say? Just because I dress well and like to dance --
What are you trying to say? Just because I dress well and like to dance --
What? No. I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
What? No. I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
Oh, well that's easy: I'm hot. You're... well, you're a little limp. Sue's easy to see through. And Ben's always been a hardass. Why aren't you writing this down?
He's right. These costumes are... missing something. I can't put my finger on it --
They're not costumes.
That's what I'm trying to calculate. And it's not rubber. It's muscle, tendon. I seem to have the ability to manipulate the malleability of my molecular structure and redistribute my density to --
Right, whatever, have fun.
You need to control yourself and think before you --
Act. Here we go again. Reed, what if we got these gifts for a reason? What if we have some, you know... like, calling?
Act. Here we go again. Reed, what if we got these gifts for a reason? What if we have some, you know... like, calling?
A higher calling like getting girls and making money?
Johnny. SUPERNOVA.
But all these people...
But all these people...
Now.
The synthetics act as a second skin, adapting to your individual needs to --
Keep the hot side hot, and the cool side cool!
Apparently I can disappear.
Please tell me you go silent too.
Flame on, flame off. Flame on, flame off --
Johnny.
Stop it.
Okay, "mom."
What is that thing?
I think that thing is Ben.
Wait. You mean there's chance we could be full-on-24-7-fantastic?
Grow up, Johnny. You want to run around on fire for the rest of your life?
Grow up, Johnny. You want to run around on fire for the rest of your life?
Is that a trick question? C'mon, I can't be the only one who thinks this is cool.
You're really cramping my style here.
You were at 4000 Kelvin. Any hotter, you're approaching supernova --
You were at 4000 Kelvin. Any hotter, you're approaching supernova --
Sweet.
Sweet.
That's the temperature of the sun.
Uh, we call my sister the invisible girl... the Invisible Girl.
Girl...?!
I'm driving.
Dude. That's my sister.
You're gonna pay for that, Pebbles. What?!
You gave us names? What are you, the "face" of the Fantastic Four now?
You two need a time-out.
Blockhead started it!
Johnny? Did you see Ben?
Yeah, for the last time, I hope. I'm done with this freak show. I'm moving back to the real world.
Yeah, for the last time, I hope. I'm done with this freak show. I'm moving back to the real world.
Is that what you call it? "Real"?
Is that what you call it? "Real"?
At least it beats living in a lab like somebody's science project.
Johnny, slow down. Think. You know mom didn't raise us to --
Look around, sis! She's not here. So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy --
Look around, sis! She's not here. So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy --
As soon as you stop acting like one. Come on, you're smarter than this. You think those people out there care about you? You're just a fad to them.
I'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --
No, I'm sorry, for pushing you out.
What are you doing --
Sis. Let me take care of you for once.
Sis. Let me take care of you for once.
But Johnny... you can't fly.
If Reed's right, then this little trip will double our stock offering.
And if he's not...?
And if he's not...?
Reed's always right. Good thing he doesn't always know what he's got...
They're ready for you, sir.
Showtime.
Our numbers are through the roof. The IPO's tracking at fifty, sixty a share. The bank's five times oversubscribed --
It's not just the money. I could make money in my sleep.
It's not just the money. I could make money in my sleep.
Then what is it?
Then what is it?
History, Leonard. History. Everything else is conversation... How's the other matter?
Leonard, how's the feed?
Recording, sir. We see you perfectly.
How's the IPO?
Stable. We're looking at low twenties. It's a good number, considering the fallout from --
Stable. We're looking at low twenties. It's a good number, considering the fallout from --
Reed's disaster. You know, I half- think he did this to me on purpose.
Reed's disaster. You know, I half- think he did this to me on purpose.
Sir, I'm sure he wouldn't put himself --
Get me on the AM shows, Larry King, cover of the Journal... I've got to do something about this scar. Make sure they only shoot my right side.
Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar "humanizes" you.
Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar "humanizes" you.
And that's a good thing?
You know, maybe you should get some rest --
Later. First, I've got some unfinished business. A deal that needs closing...
Sir, I've always wondered... Why Sue? You could have any woman in the world but --
That's why. Because I could have any other woman... You know, when they asked Caesar "why England," he said, "because it's not mine."
Make sure you find Ben, bring him back here. And keep it quiet. I don't need this to hit the press.
Yes sir. You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
Yes sir. You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
Front page?
Front page?
Top left, like you asked. Today Wall Street. Tomorrow, who knows... maybe Washington.
You're, you've, I mean, how have you bee--
Never better.
Those solar winds are flaring, but I factored them into my coordinates and --
I was talking about us. Working together.
Well, uh, based on our history... you can handle the biogenetics, and I'll focus on the molecular physics. Or, uhm, maybe I should take the biotech, you work the microscopes, since you have some background in electropho--
Right. That's exactly what I meant.
I, uh, think I remember the number.
It's been changed.
As far as crew, I was hoping Ben could pilot the mission --
Well, he's welcome to ride shotgun, but we already have a pilot on our payroll. You remember my brother Johnny...
Material made from self-regulating unstable molecules. I've been working on a formula for this.
Great minds think alike.
Feeling better?
Yes, thanks.
Yes, thanks.
That's good. That's uh... good.
That's good. That's uh... good.
You always had a way with words. I should be getting back.
You're happy for me and Victor.
I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship --
I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship --
Which was?
Which was?
Passion.
For science.
You are such a dork, Reed... You never got it and never will unless it's explained to you in quantum physics.
Uh, Sue...? I can't.
What? What do you mean you --
What? What do you mean you --
Sue... look at your hands.
It has to be the cloud. It's fundamentally altered our DNA.
Let's not jump to conclusions, we need a massive amount of evidence before making that leap.
What?
We need to get past them.
Sue. Your clothes. Lose them.
What...? Oh.
How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us?
That's what we're here to find out.
That's what we're here to find out.
If it happened to him, then it could...
It's not "invisibility" per se. You're bending the light around you with some kind of malleable force field. That's what you projected on the Bridge.
What about you? You haven't eaten in days. How come you're never on this side of the microscope?
You should be able to bend light around other objects, even people, if you could control your emotional state better --
Excuse me?
I'm saying, if you had a little more self control, you could locate the trigger. Can you remember the exact emotions when --
Anger. Rage. Frustration.
Anger. Rage. Frustration.
Okay. Is there any way to duplicate that feeling? Some memory or...
Okay. Is there any way to duplicate that feeling? Some memory or...
I'm sure I can come up with something.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that... You must think that was some kind of latent hostility or --
What in the world would give me that idea?
I mean, you broke up with me, right?
Are you kidding?
Are you kidding?
No, I distinctly remember: you walked out my door. Ergo...
Reed. I was ready for the next step, you weren't, ergo, I walked.
I think it was a little more complicated than --
I think it was a little more complicated than --
I just wanted to share an apartment. What was so complicated about that?
There were a lot of variables to consider --
No. There weren't. There was you. And me. No variables, no math. It was actually the simplest thing in the world. But your head got in the way... like it always does.
What are you doing?
The plants, from space. Their particles are still charged. With the right amount of energy, those ions could create the elemental profile of the cosmic storm.
If we can build a machine to re-create the storm, we can reverse the polarity --
And reverse the mutations --
And reverse the mutations --
Curing countless diseases, not just ours.
But we're the focus, right Reed? Reed...?
Of course. Of course.
Of course. Of course.
And you sure you can control this thing? Last time didn't work out so well.
And you sure you can control this thing? Last time didn't work out so well.
With the right energy, we can stabilize the storm. Maybe tie into the city grid...
Reed. How close are we to a cure?
No way to know. Without more tests, experiments.
Don't let Victor push you into making a mistake --
He was going to take away all my data, equipment --
He was going to take away all my data, equipment --
Better than your life. Victor's not the one who has to get into that thing. We are.
Which is why I'm working twenty hours a day, checking every variable --
Every variable but yourself. You don't eat, sleep. You can't live in your head like --
Every variable but yourself. You don't eat, sleep. You can't live in your head like --
I'm not the only one in there. I got you, Vic, Ben, Johnny, all rattling around in there.
I could get Ben to tap into the Baxter's main power to generate enough voltage --
Reed. Shh. Just be quiet. And look up.
Remember our first date here...? God, I was so nervous.
You were?
You were?
Of course I was. I'd read all your papers on bioethics. Some of them two times just so I'd have something to say to you.
You know, I bribed the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late?
I gave him twenty.
You always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach you... speak his mind. One who wasn't afraid to tell you what he wanted.
I did. I did, Reed... but I wanted you to be that man.
When I walked out, I waited ten minutes outside your door. Ten. Waiting for you to come find me.
Why didn't you say something?
Why didn't you say something?
That would have kinda defeated the purpose. And Reed... I'm saying it now.
I can... make it work.
Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
The power... I need... more power... to control... the storm --
The power... I need... more power... to control... the storm --
You need a doctor.
Sue, I need some of that anger, rage, frustration --
I'm sure I can come up with something.
I found a broken gasket, from space --
A gasket? Reed, we're at a party.
But dreams don't pay the bills, do they? Same old Reed, the hopeless optimist. Still reaching for the stars, with the world on your back.
You remember in school we talked about working together. That's what I was about to explain...
This isn't going to be a problem, is it?
Not at all.
You back this mission, and I'll sign over a fair percentage of any applications or --
The number's seventy-five. And it's applications and patents.
Funny how things turn out, isn't it?
Hilarious.
Got it. So take a walk, Ben... I'm going to borrow Susan for a second.
Sure.
We've got minutes until it hits, not hours... Victor, that storm's deadly -- the radiation's lethal. We need to abort.
Get a grip. Reed. We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch. Just close the shields...
Get a grip. Reed. We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch. Just close the shields...
Ben's still out there --
Ben's still out there --
So reel him in. But we came here to do a job. So let's do it. Quickly.
Come on, Ben, come on...
Reed, we're running out of time.
Not until Ben is back inside!
It's too late for him, and soon it'll be too late for all of us.
Just a little banged up. A couple scrapes. Why?
Ben did this.
Ben did this.
Ben did this?
Ben did this?
He's had some kind of... reaction to exposure from the cloud. And he's not the only one.
I'm starting to wonder the same thing... How much do you know about what happened to you?
Not much. We need to run tests to see the extent of the damage.
Didn't go as planned? It was a catastrophe. You ruined the lives of four people --
I ruined? With all due respect, I told you to abort --
I ruined? With all due respect, I told you to abort --
Abort? Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will not let you make me look like a fool --
Abort? Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will not let you make me look like a fool --
Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --
Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --
I don't want to understand it. This isn't one of your science projects. I just want to fix it. Fast!
What are you doing here?
What I should have done a long time ago. Applications and patents, Reed. This all belongs to me.
But I'm not done with the machine --
Which is precisely the point. Analysis is over. It's time for action. My men could have mass-produced this by now.
It's just business.
I think you both know my Director of Genetic Research, Susan Storm.
Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?
I understand the business reasons.
I understand the business reasons.
Well, when you're looking at your future, it never hurts to find closure about the past.
It's been a good two years, Victor... The company's accomplished so much.
Right, of course, the company... But you see, I've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with --
Right, of course, the company... But you see, I've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with --
Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...
Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...
Sue, I've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps. And this is the biggest step yet. If it helps, think of this as a promotion. A merger of sorts... Four little words that can change our lives...
What are you doing?
Raising the shields.
Raising the shields.
You can't leave them out there.
What's going on?
Victor, are you feeling alright?
Victor, I'm sorry I --
Just find him.
Victor, your scar --
I told you, I'm fine. It's you I'm worried about.
I told you, I'm fine. It's you I'm worried about.
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
Please, no apologies. I've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos. You'll have round-the clock care.
You said it was urgent.
It is. There's something we need to talk about. Something I need to ask you...
Victor, wait, slow down a second. I want you to know I appreciate everything you've done for me, but I just don't --
Susan. What are you doing?
He's working round the clock. But the data needs to be tested, analyzed before --
Same old Reed. All analysis, no action. Wasn't that the problem with you two?
If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us worse, maybe even kill us.
Then why is Reed dragging his feet? Maybe he likes having his prize specimen under glass... It's ironic, isn't it? You're finally the perfect woman for him... because you're his science project.
Please don't make this personal --
Oh, I think you already have.
Oh, I think you already have.
Victor, we can't do anything until the research is ready.
'Scuse me.
I know it can't be easy. Life hasn't changed that much for Reed, Sue and Johnny. At least they can go out in public. But for you? People staring. Whispering behind your back...
I know it can't be easy. Life hasn't changed that much for Reed, Sue and Johnny. At least they can go out in public. But for you? People staring. Whispering behind your back...
If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job --
If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job --
I'm just saying, I know what it's like to lose something you love. To see it slip away, and know it's never coming back.
Reed's gonna fix me up --
For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
Skeptical...?
Brad, can I talk to you a minute?
Arnold. What's happening?
Brad, I really fuckin' hate McDonald's, man. Ever since they started in with the chicken, everything went downhill.
You want to work at Carl's?
You want to work at Carl's?
Oh, man, if you could swing something there, I'd do anything for you. I want to work with you guys.
Oh, man, if you could swing something there, I'd do anything for you. I want to work with you guys.
I can probably get you in there. Just let me talk to Dennis Taylor.
I can probably get you in there. Just let me talk to Dennis Taylor.
All right!!
Were those flowers really for me, Brad?
Of course.
Of course.
How much did they cost?
How much did they cost?
Don't worry about it.
What's there to do at the Point? God, Lisa, we've been going together almost two years, and...
Brad. I don't want to have to use sex as a tool.
Brad. I don't want to have to use sex as a tool.
Tool? Tool for what? We've been going together almost two years!
Tool? Tool for what? We've been going together almost two years!
I don't want to talk about it here, Brad.
Man, I don't even want to see those guys from Carl's again.
If you'd apologize I think Dennis would take you back.
If you'd apologize I think Dennis would take you back.
Apologize to that wimp? No way. Fuck Dennis Taylor.
I'm just glad we're still together, Lisa, because I need you this year.
Look, Brad, I've been trying to think of a way to tell you this. We're almost out of high school, this is our last year. I think we owe it to ourselves to be free, and meet some new people. Then, if we get back together, we'll know it's the right thing.
Something happened to them, mon.
Come on, Spicoli. Why don't you just put your shirts back on? See the sign?
Go ahead. Just make it quick.
Totally.
Totally.
It's the first door on your left.
I can't find it, mon!
It's the first door on your left!
It's the first door on your left!
On the ledge?
On the ledge?
First door on your left!
First door on your left!
There it is!
Easy, mon.
Later.
Hamilton, come over here. What is that you've got on?
This is how I dress all the time.
This is how I dress all the time.
But you took off your Captain Kidd uniform.
But you took off your Captain Kidd uniform.
I thought I'd take it off for the drive over to IBM. It's kind of uncomfortable.
Come on, Hamilton. You're going over there to represent Captain Kidd Fish and Chips. We have stores all over Southern California. Part of our image, part of our appeal is in our uniforms. You know that!
You really want me to put all this stuff back on?
You really want me to put all this stuff back on?
Yes. I think so. Show some pride, Hamilton.
Well, I believe you have to fill out a form. There's a pad right around here.
No. I want my money back right now.
No. I want my money back right now.
Well, that's not the way it works, really. And you ate most of your food already, too...
Well, that's not the way it works, really. And you ate most of your food already, too...
See that sign? It says 100% Money Back Guarantee. Do you know the meaning of the word 'guarantee'? Do they teach you that here? Give me my money back.
I can't do that. But if you wait a minute...
Look. Just put your little hand back in the cash register and give me my $2.75 back. Okay? Please, Brad?
Look. Just put your little hand back in the cash register and give me my $2.75 back. Okay? Please, Brad?
I'm sorry, sir. Just let me find the forms here.
I'm sorry, sir. Just let me find the forms here.
I am so tired. I am so tired of dealing with morons. How hard is it to...
Mister, if you don't shut up, I'm gonna kick 100% of your ass.
Manager!!
Hi, Brad.
Sis.
Everyone wants to know where Lisa is. How should I know where Lisa is? What am I gonna do? Now my little sister goes to the same high school. The party's over. So who do you have first period?
U.S. History. Mr. Hand.
U.S. History. Mr. Hand.
Hey-yo.
Mom says to clean up the pool.
Why can't you do it?
Why can't you do it?
Your friends use the pool. Your friends messed it up.

Your friends use the pool too.

I take out the garbage.

Don't strain yourself.
Brad! Have Mom or Dad seen this?
They're not home yet.
They're not home yet.
Brad, what would you say if I asked you to just put these flowers in the trunk of the Cruising Vessel and get rid of them at work?
Brad, what would you say if I asked you to just put these flowers in the trunk of the Cruising Vessel and get rid of them at work?
I'd say... who the hell is Ron Johnson?
I'd say... who the hell is Ron Johnson?
I'll explain everything later.
Thanks for getting rid of those flowers.
Don't worry about it. Who sent the flowers?
Don't worry about it. Who sent the flowers?
It's just some guy I met at Swenson's. You don't know him.
It's just some guy I met at Swenson's. You don't know him.
I don't care it you tell me or not. I got problems of my own.
Is everything okay at work?
Are you kidding? Work is great. I kill at work. I don't even mind Mom and Dad making me pay rent.
Are you kidding? Work is great. I kill at work. I don't even mind Mom and Dad making me pay rent.
You're going to break up with Lisa, aren't you?
You're going to break up with Lisa, aren't you?
I've been doing some thinking. It's my last school year. I'm a single, successful guy. I think I want my freedom.
I've been doing some thinking. It's my last school year. I'm a single, successful guy. I think I want my freedom.
Why? Because she won't sleep with you?
Why? Because she won't sleep with you?
Where did you hear that?
Where did you hear that?
I'm just guessing.
I'm just guessing.
Well... it's true.
Well... it's true.
Maybe you just need to give her some time. She's so nice, Brad. Everybody loves Lisa.
Maybe you just need to give her some time. She's so nice, Brad. Everybody loves Lisa.
Everybody loves Lisa. Everybody loves Lisa. But everybody doesn't have to be her boyfriend.
Hey, Brad. Are you still a virgin?
Why?
Why?
I don't know. I was just curious.
I don't know. I was just curious.
Maybe yes. Maybe no.
Maybe yes. Maybe no.
You are a virgin!
You are a virgin!
I didn't say that.
I didn't say that.
But your face did!
Are you still a virgin?
Maybe yes. Maybe no.
Maybe yes. Maybe no.
Don't give me that shit! I know you're still a virgin!
Does Mom know you have company?
It's just Linda. And Mark from school.
Yeah. This is it. I have some shopping to do.
See you later.
See you later.
Thanks a lot, Brad. I really appreciate it.
Since when do you shop at the Flea Market anyway?
Brad. Please don't tell Mom and Dad...
You're not going to tell me, are you?
No.
No.
All right, then. It's your secret.
Any problems?
No, just a couple of surfers with no shirts on. I took care of it, Dennis.
Did you throw away those fries, Hamilton?
They were left over from the last shift.
They were left over from the last shift.
Those were perfectly good fries, Hamilton. Perfectly good.
Those were perfectly good fries, Hamilton. Perfectly good.
But they weren't mine.
Come on. Clean that counter off Brad. Let's go. Play ball.
Okay, Dennis.
Did you threaten this man or use profanity in any way?
He insulted me first. He called me a moron.
He insulted me first. He called me a moron.
Did you threaten this customer or use profanity in any way?
Did you threaten this customer or use profanity in any way?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
You're fired.
Dad says you have to get up!
Ugh.
Leave me alone!
Dad says you're late again, you butthole!
Dad says you're late again, you butthole!
Leave me alone.
Leave me alone.
Dad says!
Jeff you have company!
Go away, Curtis. If you can't knock, I can't hear you.
Nice to meet you, Stacy.
Nice to meet you.
Hey! We came over to help you with Math homework!
Oh, really?
Well, that's exactly why I brought some Wisk for the jacuzzi.
O-kay, you guys can come swimming. But you have to leave as soon as my Mom gets home. Okay?
I can't wait until I can drive next year. I walk every day. It's such a drag.
Get a ride with somebody.
Get a ride with somebody.
Sometimes I get a ride with my brother. But he usually works in the mornings, and then drives to school himself.

What a guy.
You know Mark Ratner really likes you. You like him?
Mark is a really nice boy...
Do you have any ice tea?
Sure. Come on in.
I guess the annuals are coming in pretty soon. Are you going to get one?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Aren't you curious to see how your class picture turned out?
Aren't you curious to see how your class picture turned out?
I know what I look like.
Do you want to take a quick swim?
Well...
Well...
Brad probably has some trunks you can borrow... I'm going to my room to change!
Pick a suit.
I don't know. It's getting pretty late...
Are you really a virgin?
Come on...
Listen. I feel pretty strange here. Because Mark really likes you, and he's my friend.
He's my friend, too.
You're a really good kisser.
So are you. Are you shaking?
So are you. Are you shaking?
No. Are you crazy?
Why don't you take off your clothes, Mike?
You first.
You first.
How about both of us at the same time?
I want you to know that it's your final decision if we should continue or not.
Let's continue.
Hey, Mike?
What? Are you all right?
What? Are you all right?
I think we're making a lot of noise.
I think we're making a lot of noise.
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
What's wrong?
I think I came. Didn't you feel it?
I think I came. Didn't you feel it?
I guess I did.
Oh. Hi.
I didn't see you this morning.
I didn't see you this morning.
Look, I'm kind of in a hurry.
Look, I'm kind of in a hurry.
I'm in a hurry too. I just thought I could say hi to you.
I'm in a hurry too. I just thought I could say hi to you.
Hello.
What's going on?
Mike, there's something that's been on my mind and I have to tell you about it.
Mike, there's something that's been on my mind and I have to tell you about it.
What? Now?
Why don't you call me up tonight?
Mike. I want you to know that I'm pregnant.
How do you know it's mine? We only did it once.
I know it's yours.
Take that back.
All right, I take it back.
There's only one thing we can do. We've got to get rid of it. We've got to get an abortion.
We've got to get an abortion?
We've got to get an abortion?
Yeah. My brother Art got his girlfriend one once.
Yeah. My brother Art got his girlfriend one once.
It's already planned, Mike. It's going to cost $150 at the Free Clinic.
It's already planned, Mike. It's going to cost $150 at the Free Clinic.
Doesn't sound free to me. So you want me to pay for it?
Doesn't sound free to me. So you want me to pay for it?
Half. Okay? Seventy-five dollars. And a ride to the clinic.
Half. Okay? Seventy-five dollars. And a ride to the clinic.
Seventy-five dollars, and a ride. Okay.
Mike! You have a mess on C-9!
All right. All right. I just cleaned B-8. Give me a break.
All right. All right. I just cleaned B-8. Give me a break.
Get going.
Do you ever look at those girls who work at Swenson's? They're beautiful. And I have to stand out here and watch them six nights a week.
You should work for yourself.
You... are a wuss. Part wimp. Part pussy.
What do you mean -- wuss? This girl is my exact type. It's her. Definitely her.
What do you mean -- wuss? This girl is my exact type. It's her. Definitely her.
It's definitely your mama.
It's definitely your mama.
Damone, you gotta listen to me.
All right... where did you see her?
She's in my biology class.
She's in my biology class.
Did you get her number?
Did you get her number?
No.
No.
Did you get her name?
Did you get her name?
No. It's too soon.
No. It's too soon.
It's never too soon! Girls decide how far to let you go in the first five minutes.
It's never too soon! Girls decide how far to let you go in the first five minutes.
Well, what do you want me to do? Go up to this strange girl in my biology class and say, 'Hello! I'd like you to take your clothes off and jump on me?'
Well, what do you want me to do? Go up to this strange girl in my biology class and say, 'Hello! I'd like you to take your clothes off and jump on me?'
I would. Yeah.
I would. Yeah.
Really?
Really?
I can see it all now. This is going to be just like the girl you fell in love with at Fotomat this summer. You bought forty bucks of fuckin' film and you never even talked to her.
I can see it all now. This is going to be just like the girl you fell in love with at Fotomat this summer. You bought forty bucks of fuckin' film and you never even talked to her.
You tell me, Mike. What do I do?
You tell me, Mike. What do I do?
Okay. Okay. Here's what you do.
Don't talk to her. Let her know. Use your face. Use your body. Use everything. This is what I do. I just sent out the vibe and I have personally found that... girls do respond. Something happens.
Of course something happens. You put the vibe out to thirty million chicks, you know something's gonna happen.
Of course something happens. You put the vibe out to thirty million chicks, you know something's gonna happen.
That's the idea, Rat. That's The Attitude.
That's the idea, Rat. That's The Attitude.
The Attitude? The Attitude dictates that you don't care if she comes, stays, lays or prays. Whatever happens, your toes are still tappin'. When you are the cruelest and the coolest... then you have The Attitude.
The business is changing, Rat. I'll tell you, these kids today... they don't even listen to Aerosmith.
I hear they all dress like that at Lincoln now.
I hear they all dress like that at Lincoln now.
There used to be three or four of those guys. Now we see 'em every time we come to the mall.
Hey, Rat.
Yeah?
Yeah?
Ace the jacket.
Knock it off, Damone. I need real help.
What do you mean? Men have died trying to obtain this information. I will give it to you for free.
Okay. Tell me. What's the Five Point Plan?
All right. Pay attention.
And that is how you talk to a girl, Rat. Voila. You can't miss.
I think I've got it. Once I get going, I'll be okay. But... how do I get started? I mean, I hardly know her.
I think I've got it. Once I get going, I'll be okay. But... how do I get started? I mean, I hardly know her.
You wuss. It's no problem. One person says something to the other and that's how it starts...
Yo.
Damone. It's Mark.
Damone. It's Mark.
Mark. What happened to your date?
Mark. What happened to your date?
It's happening right now. I'm here at the Atlantis. Everything's fine except... I left my wallet at home.
It's happening right now. I'm here at the Atlantis. Everything's fine except... I left my wallet at home.
Did you go home and get it?
Did you go home and get it?
No. It's too late. The food is coming and everything. Damone, I've got to ask you this favor, and I'll never ask you for anything again in this lifetime or any other. Will you please borrow your mom's car, go by my house, get my wallet, and meet me back here?
Damone, are you there?
I'm really pretty busy...
Hey, Mark. Is that you?
Damone! You come here?
Damone! You come here?
I come for the seafood. It's great! Hey... you know what, Mark? I found your wallet the other day. You want it back?
I come for the seafood. It's great! Hey... you know what, Mark? I found your wallet the other day. You want it back?
Wow. I've been looking for that thing! Hey, Damone, have you met Stacy Hamilton? Stacy, this is Mike Damone.
Well, I've gotta be running.
Okay. See ya.
Poor guy.
Really.
No. I don't think so. Not right now.
Chicken!
If you ask me, she's pretty aggressive. You understand what I'm saying?
No Damone. I don't understand.
No Damone. I don't understand.
She wasn't really your girlfriend anyway.
She wasn't really your girlfriend anyway.
Hey fuck you Damone. There's a lot of girls out there and you mess around with Stacy. What have you got to prove?
Hey fuck you Damone. There's a lot of girls out there and you mess around with Stacy. What have you got to prove?
Jesus. I'm sorry.
Jesus. I'm sorry.
I always stick up for you. Whenever people say 'Aw, that Damone is a loudmouth' -- and they say that a lot -- I say 'You just don't know Damone.' When someone says you're an idiot, I tell them 'Damone's not an idiot. You just don't know him.' Well, you know, Damone, maybe they do know you pretty good. And I'm just finding out.

Fine. Get lost.
You're losing it, Damone.
You're crazy. Those girls love me.
The Attitude, Damone, is only good until you meet the right girl.
Whatever you say, Rat.
And... you can only tell it's the right girl if you're sensitive.
Sensitive -- what is that?
Sensitive -- what is that?
Sensitive is when you can tell how people feel without asking.
Sensitive is when you can tell how people feel without asking.
So what makes you so sensitive?
So what makes you so sensitive?
Well, for one, I read. I don't watch as much television as you. I'm trying to feel things more. I'm learning a lot about people.
Well, for one, I read. I don't watch as much television as you. I'm trying to feel things more. I'm learning a lot about people.
What do you read? What's the last book you read?
What do you read? What's the last book you read?
Lust For Life. It's the story of Vincent Van Gough.

Yeah, well, I saw the movie. That must mean I'm sensitive too.
Yeah, well, I saw the movie. That must mean I'm sensitive too.
It's a way, Damone. It's a vibe. I put it out, and I have personally found that girls do respond.
Are you Linda Barrett?
Yes.
Yes.
I'm Carrie Frazier from Toys 'R Us. Judy Hinton from May Company told me I could ask you something.
All right, what you want to do is go to the Free Clinic and tell the doctor that you have sex regularly -- several times a week -- and that you need Nornel One Plus Fifty's.
And they don't call my parents?
And they don't call my parents?
Not if you're over sixteen.
Not if you're over sixteen.
Okay. Thanks a lot, Linda.
Okay. Thanks a lot, Linda.
And don't let them talk you into a diaphragm either.
How've you been?
Outrageous, Merv. Nice to be here. I feel great.
Outrageous, Merv. Nice to be here. I feel great.
I was going to say... your eyes look a little red.
I was going to say... your eyes look a little red.
I've been swimming, Merv.
Seriously, Merv, everything is great. I was thinking about picking up some hash this weekend, maybe going up to the mountains.
I wanted to talk a little bit about school, if I could...
I wanted to talk a little bit about school, if I could...
School. School is no problem. All you have to do is go to get the grades. And if you know something, all you have to do is go about half the time.
School. School is no problem. All you have to do is go to get the grades. And if you know something, all you have to do is go about half the time.
How often do you go?
How often do you go?
I don't go at all.
I hear you brought a film clip with you. Do you want to set it up for us?
Well, it pretty much speaks for itself. Peter, you want to run with it?
Merv, this is the action down at Sunset Cliffs at about six in the morning.
Fascinating.
Who's that?
That's me, Merv.
Are you going to ride that wave?
Totally.
What's going through your mind right here, Jeff? The danger of it all?
Merv, I'm thinking... I've only got about four good hours of surfing left before these little clowns from junior high start showing up with their boogie boards.
Hey, slow down. This is my brother's car.
I thought he was out of town.
I thought he was out of town.
He is.
He is.
Then don't hassle it.
Seen the new Playboy?
Naw. Any good?
Naw. Any good?
Suzanne Somers' tits.
Suzanne Somers' tits.
All right.
All right.
I like sex.
What the fuck is this guy doing?
This ain't no cop.
It's a bunch of Jocks in a Granada!
They're fuckin' with us.
My brother's car!
All right. Die, Granada Jocks!
We just missed the turnoff to the party.
You know the thing I love about Mustangs? The steering wheel.
My brother is going to kill us. He's gonna kill you and then he's gonna kill me. He's gonna kill us.
Just be glad you're all right.
Just be glad you're all right.
My brother is gonna shit.
My brother is gonna shit.
Make up your mind. Is he gonna shit, or is he gonna kill us?
Make up your mind. Is he gonna shit, or is he gonna kill us?
First he's gonna shit. And then he's gonna kill us.
First he's gonna shit. And then he's gonna kill us.
Will you just relax, mon? He's not gonna kill us. My father is a television repairman. He's got all kinds of tools. I can fix-this car.
Will you just relax, mon? He's not gonna kill us. My father is a television repairman. He's got all kinds of tools. I can fix-this car.
You can't fix this car, Spicoli.
That's him! He did it!
Hey, mon, I don't know what your trip is, but...
How's it going.
Do you think that guy's cute?
Don't you like him?
Yeah, but I fucked up. You can take it. Really.
Yeah, but I fucked up. You can take it. Really.
Come on, Stacy, it's your section and your man.
Come on, Stacy, it's your section and your man.
What should I do?
What should I do?
Just take his order, look him in the eye and if he says anything remotely funny, laugh a lot.
He gave me his card. 'Ron Johnson, Audio Consultant.'
Should we buy a frame for that?
Should we buy a frame for that?
Come on, Linda, I haven't had a boyfriend all summer. You promised when I started working at the mall that my life would change... Do you think he'll call this week?
Come on, Linda, I haven't had a boyfriend all summer. You promised when I started working at the mall that my life would change... Do you think he'll call this week?
Listen, Stace, you want to know about guys? I'll tell you. They're mostly chicken. Before I met Doug I chased after every guy I thought was cute. I thought if I gave out a vibe they'd get the message and call me up. Well, guess what? They don't call.

So what did you do?
So what did you do?
I called them. If I was sitting next to a guy and I wanted to sit closer, I'd sit closer. If I wanted to kiss him, I'd just do it. You want Ron Johnson? Grab him.
I called them. If I was sitting next to a guy and I wanted to sit closer, I'd sit closer. If I wanted to kiss him, I'd just do it. You want Ron Johnson? Grab him.
I can't do that.
Face it. With some guys you have to make the first move. A lot of guys are just... wussies.
Really?
Really?
Stacy, what are you waiting for? You're fifteen. I did it when I was thirteen. It's no huge thing. It's just sex. If you don't, one of the other girls will.
Stacy, what are you waiting for? You're fifteen. I did it when I was thirteen. It's no huge thing. It's just sex. If you don't, one of the other girls will.
He was hot, wasn't he?
He was hot, wasn't he?
If I didn't have a fiancé in Chicago, I'd go for it.
I can't believe I start high school tomorrow.
Believe it.
I hear some surfer pulled a knife on Mr. Hand this morning.
No way! He just called him a dick.
No way! He just called him a dick.
God. People exaggerate so much at this school.
Linda. That girl looks just like Pat Benatar.
I know.
Do you think guys find that attractive?
Oh, give me a break, Stacy. You're much prettier than them.
Yeah but they look more sophisticated. You'd probably think they'd be better in bed.
What do you mean 'better in bed.' You either do it or you don't.
What do you mean 'better in bed.' You either do it or you don't.
No there are variables that, like, I might not be good at.

Like, you know, giving blow jobs.

What's the big deal?

Well I never did it.
Well I never did it.
There's nothing to it.
Just kidding. About 10cc.
Oh! That's where that group got its name from.
Was it great?
It was okay.
It was okay.
You'll always remember your first time.
You'll always remember your first time.
It was nice.

So tell me, do you like Ron? Is it serious?
So tell me, do you like Ron? Is it serious?
Come on, Linda. It's just sex.
Come on, Linda. It's just sex.
Hey! That's my line!
There... There's his car. I know he's at work tonight. He hasn't come into Swenson's since he called my house. My mother told him I was still at high school, after I told him I was nineteen. I guess I should tell him I'm fifteen.
Don't you dare, you'll never hear from him again.
Don't you dare, you'll never hear from him again.
Does Doug care that you're seventeen?
Does Doug care that you're seventeen?
Doug sees beyond that stuff to what the person inside is like. That's why I'm marrying him.

If he ever calls again I'll say I'm eighteen.
If he ever calls again I'll say I'm eighteen.
Boy I am so glad to be through with all these games.
You've got to get used to working Christmas. People are always screaming and yelling... then they get home and they're all Christmasy.
I think Christmas brings out the worst in people.
I think Christmas brings out the worst in people.
I guess Ron hasn't called yet.
I guess Ron hasn't called yet.
Not since November.
Don't you think it meant anything to him. Even if I am fifteen?
Stacy. What does it matter? He's a stereo salesman. You want to marry him? You want to have kids with him? You want this guy to come home, fifty years old, and he's still got that little Pacific Stereo badge on? Come on.
I should quit this job. I'm going to get so fat working here... nobody will ever take me out.
Stacy. How many times do I have to tell you? You are really going to be beautiful... someday.
Stacy. How many times do I have to tell you? You are really going to be beautiful... someday.
Thanks a lot.
What do you think of that guy who works at the theatre? You know, Mark Ratner.
Oh, come on. What is he? Fifteen?
Oh, come on. What is he? Fifteen?
Sixteen.
I sent a letter to Doug today. I'll be so glad when he gets out here.
You really ought to look at this, Linda. There's a drawing on every page... and all these quizzes. It's like school.
You really ought to look at this, Linda. There's a drawing on every page... and all these quizzes. It's like school.
Why don't you put your mother's secret book back?
Listen to this... 'What are your mate's three most erogenous zones?'
Okay, penis, that's one, balls...
Okay, penis, that's one, balls...
Wouldn't penis and balls be the same category?
Wouldn't penis and balls be the same category?
You're right. Probably penis, mouth and neck.
You're right. Probably penis, mouth and neck.
All right! Here's another one. 'The most satisfactory lovemaking occurs when your mate climaxes first, you climax first, you and your mate climax together?'
All right! Here's another one. 'The most satisfactory lovemaking occurs when your mate climaxes first, you climax first, you and your mate climax together?'
Climax together.

Does that ever happen?
Does that ever happen?
No. But it's a nice idea.
No. But it's a nice idea.
Listen to this... it says 'Most women derive pleasure from sex, but they don't have real orgasms.'
How long does Doug take?
I don't know. Thirty to forty minutes.
I don't know. Thirty to forty minutes.
What's Doug do in Chicago?
What's Doug do in Chicago?
He works for the airline. He'll be out here. You'll meet him.
What do you think?
I think they're both virgins.
I didn't ask for any help. Did you, Linda?
No.
God, he hardly even talks anymore.
I know. He hates to have to wear uniforms.
Stacy! I've got water in my ears. Do you have any Q-Tips?
God, I don't think so. Better look in the house.
God, Stacy, it's not that sad. It's just David Soul and Ricardo Montalban.
I don't know, I'm just so depressed. Everything is just so... depressing.
You have been acting very strange the last few weeks.
I don't know... I just don't feel right.
What do you think it is?
What do you think it is?
What do you think it is?
It couldn't be.
It couldn't be.
It could be. I had a pregnancy test at the clinic. I'll find out Monday. I guess it was Damone.
It could be. I had a pregnancy test at the clinic. I'll find out Monday. I guess it was Damone.
Of course it was Damone. If it was Ron Johnson, you'd be out to here!
Of course it was Damone. If it was Ron Johnson, you'd be out to here!
I'm not going to tell him. He's an asshole. I hate him.
I'm not going to tell him. He's an asshole. I hate him.
But it costs money to have an abortion. Even at the Free Clinic. You tell Damone to pay for it. It's the least he can do. It's the guy's responsibility too.
You know, there's one thing you didn't tell me about guys.
What?
What?
You didn't tell me that they can be so nice, so great... but then you sleep with them and they start acting like they're five years old.
You didn't tell me that they can be so nice, so great... but then you sleep with them and they start acting like they're five years old.
You're right. I didn't tell you that.
I really thought he would show up. I waited... and waited... and waited...
That little prick.
That little prick.
Then I called his house, and his mother told me he was in the garage helping his father.

Don't do anything, Linda. I'd rather just forget about it. I don't even like the guy.
Don't do anything, Linda. I'd rather just forget about it. I don't even like the guy.
Stacy, he's not a guy. He's a little prick!
Another summer of working at Swenson's.
Come on. There's lots of men around here. Keep your eyes open.
Come on. There's lots of men around here. Keep your eyes open.
You know, Linda. I've finally figured it out. It's not sex I want. Anyone can have sex.

This is U.S. History, right? I saw the globe in the window.
Really?
Can I come in?
Oh, please. I get so lonely when that third attendance bell rings and I don't see all my kids here.
Mr. Spicoli?
That's the name they gave me.
You just ripped my card in two!
Yes.
Yes.
Hey, bud. What's your problem?
Hey! Wait a minute! There's no birthday party for me here!
Thank you, Desmond. What's the reason for your truancy?

Learning about Cuba. Having some food.

Mr. Spicoli, you're on dangerous ground here. You're causing a major disturbance in my class and on my time.
Mr. Spicoli, you're on dangerous ground here. You're causing a major disturbance in my class and on my time.
I've been thinking about this, Mr. Hand. If I'm here... and you're here... doesn't that make it our time?
You better save some for me, you swine!
And you, my friend. I'll see you for a two-hour detention every afternoon this week.
Mr... Mr. Hand.
That's right, Jeff. Mind if I come in?
Were you going somewhere tonight, Jeff?
Yeah. The Graduation Dance Mr. Hand. It's the last school event of the year.

I don't know. I guess so.
I don't know. I guess so.
Fine. You sit right here on your bed. I'll use the chair here. As I explained to your parents just a moment ago, and to you many times since the very beginning of the school year -- I don't like to spend my time waiting for late students, or detention cases. I'd rather be preparing the lesson.
Now, Mr. Spicoli, comes a rare moment for me. Now I have the unique pleasure of squaring our account. Tonight, you and I are going to talk in great detail about the Davis Agreement, all the associated treaties, and the American Revolution in particular. Now if you can just turn to Chapter 47 of Lord of Truth And Liberty.
Hey, it's in my locker, Mr. Hand.
Hey, it's in my locker, Mr. Hand.
Well, then, I'm glad I remembered to bring an extra copy just for you.
I think I've made my point with you tonight.
Hey, Mr. Hand, can I ask you a question?
Hey, Mr. Hand, can I ask you a question?
What's that?
What's that?
Do you have a guy like me every year? A guy to... I don't know, make a show of. Teach other kids lessons and stuff?
Do you have a guy like me every year? A guy to... I don't know, make a show of. Teach other kids lessons and stuff?
Well, you'll find out next year.
Well, you'll find out next year.
No way, mon. When I graduate U.S. history I ain't even coming over to your side of the building.
No way, mon. When I graduate U.S. history I ain't even coming over to your side of the building.
If you graduate.
If you graduate.
You're gonna flunk me?!
Don't worry, Spicoli. You'll probably squeak by.
All right! Oh, yeah!
Aloha, Mr. Hand!
Aloha, Spicoli.
You look like you could still be in high school.
I know, everyone says that.
What can I get for you tonight.
How about your phone number?
Thanks for picking me up.
No problem.
'The Cuer-vo Gold, the fi-ine Columbian.' You look nice tonight.
Thanks. So do you.
Thanks. So do you.
Where do you feel like going?
Where do you feel like going?
I don't know. Wherever you want.
I don't know. Wherever you want.
How about the point?
How about the point?
The point sounds fine.
The point sounds fine.
All right, the point it is.
That's a nice shirt.
Thanks. Thanks a lot.
It's very warm out tonight.
It is. It's very warm. I wonder how long it will last?
Are you really nineteen?
Yes... I am really nineteen.
I think I better take you home.
What about those other guys you live with?
What about those other guys you live with?
No. I mean back to your home.
Is this your first time?
Yes.
What do you do with the jackets people leave here?
We keep them.
We keep them.
You keep them.
You keep them.
We keep them, in case the people come back.
What's your other question?
My other question is... can-I-have your-phone-number-so-I-can-ask-you out-sometime?
Do you have a pen? This one's out of ink.
Oh... yes.
Thanks for coming to get me.
Sure thing.
This is a nice car.
Yeah. It's my sister's.
Do you have Mrs. George for English?
Yeah. She is pretty good.
Yeah. She is pretty good.
Yeah. She is pretty good.
Joey at Cinema Four said this is a pretty good restaurant.
I've heard that, too.
Do you know what you want?
I think I'll have the Seafood Salad Special.
I think I'll have the Seafood Salad Special.
Excellent.
Are you all right?
Oh yeah.
Do you mind if I excuse myself for a moment?
Not at all.
Sure. I'll... have another Coke.
Two more Cokes.
I had a really nice time tonight.
Me, too. I'm real sorry someone broke in and stole your tape deck.
I never thought it would happen at The Atlantis. Jeez.
Do you want to come inside?
Do you want to come inside?
Aren't your parents asleep?
Aren't your parents asleep?
No, they're away for the weekend. Brad and I are watching the house.
No, they're away for the weekend. Brad and I are watching the house.
Okay. Sure. I'll come in.
Where's your brother?
I don't know. Probably out. Want something to drink?
I don't know. Probably out. Want something to drink?
No. That's okay.
No. That's okay.
Well, I'm going to change real quick. I hope you don't mind.
Well, I'm going to change real quick. I hope you don't mind.
Naw. I don't mind.
So... pretty nice house you've got here.
Thanks. So... What do you want to do?
I don't know.
Do you want to see some pictures? I kept a lot of scrapbooks and pictures and stuff from junior high. How stupid, right?
Do you want to see some pictures? I kept a lot of scrapbooks and pictures and stuff from junior high. How stupid, right?
Sure.
This is me in the eighth grade. Did you have Mr. Deegan?
Oh, yeah. I had Mr. Deegan.
...I've got to go home.
Do you really have to go?
Do you really have to go?
Well... it's getting kind of late.
Where's Mike today?
Today's April 16th. Damone never comes to school on April 16th.

What's April 16th?
What's April 16th?
It's John Bonham's birthday.
It's John Bonham's birthday.
John Bonham?
John Bonham?
John Bonham. The drummer for Led Zeppelin. He died a couple years ago. Every birthday he stays home and plays everything John Bonham ever recorded. It's like his own holiday.

Oh. I see.
I made a fool of myself.
Nobody noticed. Don't worry about it. We'll just stay out here until everyone comes out, we'll blend back in.

What about the notes?
What about the notes?
I'll get you the notes.
Hi, Mark.
Hi, Stacy. How are you?
Hi, Stacy. How are you?
I'm fine. Mark, I'm so glad you came over here because I want you to know something. I just thought I would tell you that I really enjoyed getting to know you this year.
Yeah? About fifty people I didn't know wrote that in my annual.
I know everybody says it, but I really mean it.
Really?
Yeah. I want you to have this picture, so you won't forget what I look like. And so you'll remember to call me over the summer.
Well, I don't know, I may be doing some traveling this summer. I don't know how much I'll be around... But I'll give you a call sometime.
I'd like that.
Are you ready to order here?
Well... sure. She will have the Seafood Salad Special. And I will have... the same.
Well... sure. She will have the Seafood Salad Special. And I will have... the same.
Anything to drink?
Anything to drink?
Two Cokes.
Two Cokes.
Okay. Thanks.
Are you sure there's nothing else I can bring you?
I'll have one more Coke... Do you want another Coke, Stacy?
Sir? This telegram came for you. Actually, it isn't for you. It's for somebody named Thompson, but it says 'care of Raoul Duke'. Does that make sense?
Yes... It makes sense.
I checked the register for this man Thompson. We don't show him but I figured he might be part of your team.
He is. Don't worry, I'll get it to him.
What confused us was Dr. Gonzo's signature on the telegram from Los Angeles. When we knew he was right here in the hotel.
You did the right thing. Never try to understand a press message. About half the time we use codes -- especially with Dr. Gonzo.

Tell me. When will the doctor be awake?
Tell me. When will the doctor be awake?
Awake? What do you mean?
Well... the manager, Mr. Heem, would like to meet him. Nothing unusual. Mr. Heem likes to meet all our large accounts... put them on a personal basis... just a chat and a handshake, you understand.
Of course. But if I were you, I'd leave the Doctor alone until after he's eaten breakfast. He's a very crude man.
But he will be available? Perhaps later this morning?
Look. That telegram was all scrambled. It was actually from Thompson, not to him. Western Union must have gotten the names reversed. I have to get going. I have to get out to the track.

There's no hurry! The race is over!
There's no hurry! The race is over!
Not for me.
Let's have lunch!
Righto!
Of course, I could hear what the Clerk was really saying...
Listen, you fuzzy little shithead -- I've been fucked around, in my time, by a fairly good cross-section of mean-tempered rule-crazy cops and now it's MY turn. "Fuck you, officer, I'm in charge here, and I'm telling you we don't have room for you."
Certainly, Mr. Duke!
My bags are out there in that white Cadillac convertible. Can you have someone drive it around to the room?
Oh, and could I get a quart of Wild Turkey, two fifths of Baccardi, and a night's worth of ice delivered to my room, please?
Don't worry about a thing, sir. Just enjoy your stay.
Don't worry about a thing, sir. Just enjoy your stay.
Well, thank you.
What's the message? My light is blinking.
Ah, yes. Mr. Duke? You have one message: "Call Lucy at the Americana Hotel, room 1600."
Ah, yes. Mr. Duke? You have one message: "Call Lucy at the Americana Hotel, room 1600."
Holy shit!
Mr. Duke? Hello, Mr. Duke, I'm sorry we were cut off a moment ago... I thought I should call again, because I was wondering...
WHAT? What was that crazy bitch said to him? There's a war on, man! People are being killed!
WHAT? What was that crazy bitch said to him? There's a war on, man! People are being killed!
Killed?
Killed?
IN VIETNAM! ON THE GODDAMN TELEVISION!
IN VIETNAM! ON THE GODDAMN TELEVISION!
Oh... yes... yes... This terrible war. When will it end?
Oh... yes... yes... This terrible war. When will it end?
Tell me. What do you want?
The woman who left that message for you sounded very disturbed. I think she was crying...
Crying? Why was she crying?
Crying? Why was she crying?
Well, uh. She didn't say Mr. Duke. But since I know you're here with the Police Convention...
Well, uh. She didn't say Mr. Duke. But since I know you're here with the Police Convention...
Look, you want to be gentle with that woman if she ever calls again. We're watching her very carefully... this woman has been into laudanum. It's a controlled experiment, but I suspect we'll need your cooperation before this thing is over.

What? Ah... yes, yes, I see what you mean... Yes... so, you'll be responsible then?
What? Ah... yes, yes, I see what you mean... Yes... so, you'll be responsible then?
Of course. And now I have to get back to the news. Send up some ice.
Rum and ice, please.
You're another one of these California boys. Your friend here's been tellin' us about dope fiends.
You're another one of these California boys. Your friend here's been tellin' us about dope fiends.
They're everywhere. Nobody's safe. And sure as hell not in the South. They like warm weather... You'd never believe it. In L.A. it's out of control. First it was drugs, now it's witchcraft.

Witchcraft? Shit, you can't mean it!
Naw! That's science fiction stuff!
Not where we operate.
Naked!?
Naked.
Cut their goddamn heads off. Every one of them. That's what we're doing in California.
WHAT?
Hell, no. We'd never hear the goddamn end of it.
Dobermans don't talk.
Dobermans don't talk.
What?
I'm a whiskey man myself. We don't have much trouble from drugs where I come from...
You will. One of these nights you'll wake up and find a junkie tearing your bedroom apart.

Naw!
Naw!
They'll climb right into your bedroom and sit on your chest with big Bowie knives. They might even sit on your wife's chest. Put the blade right down on her throat.

Not down in my parts.
What happened? What did they do to her?
Do? Jesus Christ, man. They chopped her goddamn head off right there in the parking lot! Then they cut all kinds of holes in her head and sucked out the blood!
Do? Jesus Christ, man. They chopped her goddamn head off right there in the parking lot! Then they cut all kinds of holes in her head and sucked out the blood!
And nobody did anything?
Yeh. The big guy used to be a major in the Marines.
A major!
A major!
We know where he lives, but we can't get near the house.
We know where he lives, but we can't get near the house.
Naw! Not a major.
Naw! Not a major.
He wanted the pineal gland.
He wanted the pineal gland.
Really?
Really?
That's how he got so big. When he quit the Marines he was just a little guy.
Hell, I really hate to hear this. Because everything that happens in California seems to get down our way, sooner or later. Mostly Atlanta. But that was back when the goddamn bastards were peaceful. All we had to do was to keep 'em under surveillance. They didn't roam around much... But now Jesus, it seems nobody's safe.
You're going to need to take the bull by the horns -- go to the mat with this scum.

What do you mean by that?
What do you mean by that?
You know what I mean. We've done it before and we can damn well do it again!
Where ya comin' from, young man?
Las Vegas.
Las Vegas.
A great town, that Vegas. I bet you had good luck there. You're the type.

That's a fine combination. You can't lose.
Oh, my God!...
This is my granddaughter...
This is my granddaughter...
Don't worry... ...and I'm actually the District Attorney from Ignoto County. Just another good American like yourself.
I want you to understand that this man at the wheel is my attorney! He's not just some dingbat I found on the Strip. He's a foreigner. I think he's probably Samoan. But it doesn't matter, does it? Are you prejudiced?
Hell, no!
Hell, no!
I didn't think so. Because in spite of his race, this man is extremely valuable to me. Hell, I forgot all about this beer. You want one? How about some ether?
I didn't think so. Because in spite of his race, this man is extremely valuable to me. Hell, I forgot all about this beer. You want one? How about some ether?
What?
What?
Never mind. Let's get right to the heart of this thing. Twenty-four hours ago we were sitting in the Pogo Lounge of the Beverly Wills Hotel...
Thanks for the ride. Thanks a lot. I like you guys. Don't worry about me.
Wait a minute! Come back and have a beer!
"One toke over the line, sweet Jesus."
One toke. You poor fool. Wait till you see those goddamn bats.
We're your friends. We're not like the others.
No more of that talk or I'll put the leeches on you.
If so -- well, we'll just have to cut his head off and bury him somewhere. Because it goes without saying that we can't turn him loose. He'd report us at once to some kind of outback Nazi law enforcement agency, and they'll run us down like dogs...
Jesus! Did I say that?
Jesus! Did I say that?
Or just think it? Was I talking? Did they hear me?
Or just think it? Was I talking? Did they hear me?
It's okay. He's admiring the shape of your skull.
God hell! I think I see the pattern! This one sounds like real trouble! You're going to need plenty of legal advice before this thing is over. As your attorney I must advise you that you'll need a very fast car with no top and after that, the cocaine. And then the tape recorder, for special music, and some Acapulco shirts... This blows my
Why not? If a thing's worth doing, it's worth doing right.
I tell you, my man. This is the American Dream in action! We'd be fools not to ride this strange torpedo all the way to the end.
Indeed. We must do it. What kind of story is this?
O.K., O.K., yes. Hang onto it. We'll be there in thirty minutes. I finally located a car with adequate horsepower and the proper coloring. What?! OF COURSE the gentleman has a major credit card! Do you realize who the fuck you're talking to?
Don't take any guff from these swine. Now we need a sound store with the finest equipment. Nothing dinky. One of those new Belgian Heliowatts with a voice-activated shotgun mike, for picking up conversations in oncoming cars.

We won't make the nut unless we have unlimited credit.
We won't make the nut unless we have unlimited credit.
We will. You Samoans are all the same. You have no faith in the essential decency of the white man's culture.
...and we're chock full of that!
Damn right!
Damn right!
My attorney understands this concept, despite his racial handicap. But do you?!
He said he understood, but I could see in his eyes that he didn't. He was lying to me.
My heart!
Where's the medicine?
The medicine? Yes, it's right here.
Turn up the fucking music! My heart feels like an alligator! Volume! Clarity! Bass! We must have bass! What's wrong with us? Are you goddamn old ladies?
You scurvy shyster bastard! Watch your language! You're talking to a Doctor of Journalism!
You scurvy shyster bastard! Watch your language! You're talking to a Doctor of Journalism!
What the fuck are we doing out here? Somebody call the police! We need help!

Pay no attention to this swine. He can't handle the medicine.
Pay no attention to this swine. He can't handle the medicine.
The truth is we're going to Vegas to croak a scag baron named Savage Henry. I've known him for years but he ripped us off -- and you know what that means, right?
Savage Henry has cashed his check! We're going to rip his lungs out!
And eat them! That bastard won't get away with this! What's going on in this country when a scum sucker like that can get away with sandbagging a Doctor of Journalism?
Oh, Jesus! Did you see what god just did to us?
God didn't do that! You did it! You're a fucking narcotics agent, that was our cocaine, you pig!
God didn't do that! You did it! You're a fucking narcotics agent, that was our cocaine, you pig!
You better be careful. Plenty of vultures out here. They'll pick your bones clean before morning.
You better be careful. Plenty of vultures out here. They'll pick your bones clean before morning.
You whore!
How long do I have?
Maybe thirty more minutes. As your attorney, I advise you to drive at top speed. It'll be a goddamn miracle if we can get there before you turn into a wild animal. Are you ready for that? Checking into a Vegas hotel under a phony name with intent to commit capital fraud and a head full of acid.

Thirty minutes. It was going to be very close.
Two Cuba Libres with beer and mescal on the side. Who's Lacerda, he's waiting for us in a room on the twelfth floor?
Lacerda?
I was right in the middle of a fucking reptile zoo. And somebody was giving booze to these goddamn things! It won't be long before they tear us to shreds!
If you think we're in trouble now wait until you see what's happening in the elevators.
I just went upstairs to see this man Lacerda. I told him I knew what he was up to... He says he's a photographer! But when I mentioned Savage Henry he freaked! He knows we're onto him!
But what about our room? And the golf shoes?
That's the press table. Where you have to sign in for our credentials. Shit, let's get it over with. You handle that, and I'll check on the room.
No, no. Don't leave me!
Shoot it.
Not yet. I want to study its habits.
What are you talking about?
You bastard! They'll never let us back in that place. I leave you alone for three minutes and you start waving that goddamn marlin spike around -- yelling about reptiles! You scared the shit out of those people! They were ready to call the cops. Hell, the only reason they gave us press passes was to get you out of there...
That's good...
I think he's lying to us. I could see it in his eyes.
I think he's lying to us. I could see it in his eyes.
They'll probably have a big net for us when we show up.
Total control now. Tooling along the main drag on a Saturday night in Vegas, two good old boys in a fire apple red convertible... stoned, ripped, twisted... Good people!
How about "Nickel Nick's Slot Arcade?" "Hot Slots," that sounds heavy. Twenty- nine cent hotdogs...

Look, what are we doing here? Are we here to entertain ourselves, or to do the job?
To do the job, of course. Here we go... a Crab Louie and quart of muscatel for twenty dollars!
Why?
Why what?
Holy shit! They almost had us there! That was quick thinking.
What do you expect? I'm your attorney. You owe me five bucks. I want it now.
Jesus creeping shit!
Did the mescaline just kick in? Or was that Debbie Reynolds in a silver Afro wig?!
Did the mescaline just kick in? Or was that Debbie Reynolds in a silver Afro wig?!
We wandered into a fucking time capsule!
This is the place. They'll never fuck with us here.
Where's the ether? This mescaline isn't working.
Some angry Rotarian shoves you and you think: What's happening here? What's going on? Then you hear yourself mumbling.
Dogs fucked the Pope, no fault of mine. Watch out!... Why money? My name is Brinks; I was born... Born?
Dogs fucked the Pope, no fault of mine. Watch out!... Why money? My name is Brinks; I was born... Born?
Get sheep over side... women and children to armored car... orders from Captain Zeep.
I hate to say this, but this place is getting to me. I think I'm getting The Fear.
Nonsense. We came here to find the American Dream, and now we're right in the vortex you want to quit. You must realize that we've found the Main Nerve.

Do they pay you to screw that bear?
When does this thing stop?
It won't stop. It's not ever going to stop.
Did you see that? Some sonofabitch kicked me in the back.
Probably the bartender. He wanted to stomp you for what you said to the waitress.

Good God! Let's get out of here! Where's the elevator?
Good God! Let's get out of here! Where's the elevator?
Don't go near that elevator. That's just what they want us to do... trap us in a steel box and take us down to the basement.
Don't run. They'd like any excuse to shoot us.
You drive! I think there's something wrong with me.
Yeah... I thought we might need it...
What for?
Let's go up there and blast him out of bed with the fire hose.
No, we should leave the poor bastard alone. I get the feeling that he's avoiding us for some reason.

Where'd you get that knife?
Room service sent it up. I wanted something to cut the limes.
Room service sent it up. I wanted something to cut the limes.
What limes?
What limes?
They didn't have any. They don't grow in the desert.
Have you made a deal with him? Did you put him on to her?
Look you better put that blade away and get your head straight. I have to put the car in the lot.
You evil son of a bitch. You better hope there's some Thorazine in that bag, because if there's not, you're in bad trouble.
Music! Turn it up. Put that tape on.
Music! Turn it up. Put that tape on.

OK. But do me one last favor, will you. Can you give me two hours? That's all I ask -- just two hours to sleep before tomorrow. I suspect it's going to be a very difficult day.
Of course, I'm your attorney, I'll give you all the time you need, at my normal rates: $45 an hour -- but you'll be wanting a cushion, so, why don't you just lay one of those $100 bills down there beside the radio, and fuck off?
How about a check?
How about a check?
Whatever's right.
I want that fucking radio!
Don't touch it! Get back in that tub!
Don't touch it! Get back in that tub!
Back the tape up. I need it again! Let it roll! Just as high as the fucker can go! And when it comes to that fantastic note where the rabbit bites its own head off, I want you to THROW THAT FUCKING RADIO INTO THE TUB WITH ME!
Not me. It would blast you through the wall -- stone dead in ten seconds and they'd make me explain it!
BULLSHIT! Don't make me use this.
BULLSHIT! Don't make me use this.

Do it! I want to get HIGHER!
Fuck yes. I was beginning to think I was going to have to go out and get one of the goddamn maids to do it.
Are you ready?
You bastard! You'd do that, wouldn't you?
Why worry? You'll like it. Nothing in the world like a Mace high. Forty- five minutes on your knees with the dry heaves...
Why worry? You'll like it. Nothing in the world like a Mace high. Forty- five minutes on your knees with the dry heaves...
You cheap honky sonofabitch...
You cheap honky sonofabitch...
Why not? Hell, just a minute ago, you were asking me to kill you! And now you want to kill me! What I should do, goddamnit, is call the police!
Why not? Hell, just a minute ago, you were asking me to kill you! And now you want to kill me! What I should do, goddamnit, is call the police!
The cops?
The cops?
There's no choice. I wouldn't dare go to sleep with you wandering around with a head full of acid and wanting to slice me up with that goddamn knife!
There's no choice. I wouldn't dare go to sleep with you wandering around with a head full of acid and wanting to slice me up with that goddamn knife!
Who said anything about slicing you up? I just wanted to carve a little Z on your forehead. Nothing serious.
You bastard! I need a lawyer immediately!
What are you doing in Baker? Didn't you get my telegram?
What are you doing in Baker? Didn't you get my telegram?
What? Fuck telegrams. I'm in trouble. You worthless bastard. I'll cripple your ass for this! All that shit in the car is yours! You understand that? When I finish testifying out here you'll be disbarred!
What? Fuck telegrams. I'm in trouble. You worthless bastard. I'll cripple your ass for this! All that shit in the car is yours! You understand that? When I finish testifying out here you'll be disbarred!
You're supposed to be in Vegas. We have a suite at the Flamingo. I was just about to leave for the airport.
You degenerate pig!
It can't be helped. This is Lucy. You know -- like "Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds."
WELL? What are your plans?
Plans?
Plans?
Lucy.
Lucy.
Shit. I met her on the plane and I had all that acid. You know, those little blue barrels. I gave her a cap before I realized... she's a religious freak... Jesus, she's never even had a drink.
Shit. I met her on the plane and I had all that acid. You know, those little blue barrels. I gave her a cap before I realized... she's a religious freak... Jesus, she's never even had a drink.
Well... It'll probably work out. We can keep her loaded and peddle her ass at the drug convention.
Listen, she's running away from home for something like the fifth time in six months. It's terrible.
She's perfect for this gig. These cops will go fifty bucks a head to beat her into submission and then gang fuck her. We can set her up in one of these back street motels, hang pictures of Jesus all over the room, then turn these pigs loose on her... Hell she's strong; she'll hold her own.
Jesus Christ. I knew you were sick but I never expected to hear you actually say that kind of stuff.
It's straight economics. This girl is a god-send. Shit, she can make us a grand a day.
It's straight economics. This girl is a god-send. Shit, she can make us a grand a day.
NO! Stop talking like that.
NO! Stop talking like that.
I figure she can do about four at a time. Christ, if we keep her full of acid that's more like two grand a day. Maybe three.

You filthy bastard. I should cave your fucking head in.
You filthy bastard. I should cave your fucking head in.
In a few hours, she'll probably be sane enough to work herself into a towering Jesus-based rage at the hazy recollection of being seduced by some kind of cruel Samoan who fed her liquor and LSD, dragged her to a Vegas hotel room and savagely penetrated every orifice in her body with his throbbing, uncircumcised member.
NO! I felt sorry for the girl, I wanted to help her!
You'll go straight to the gas chamber. And even if you manage to beat that, they'll send you back to Nevada for Rape and Consentual Sodomy. She's got to go.
The only alternative was to take her out to the desert and feed her remains to the lizards. But, it seemed a bit heavy for the thing we were trying to protect: My attorney.
We have to cut her loose. She's got two hundred dollars. And we can always call the cops up there in Montana, where she lives, and turn her in.

What?... What kind of goddamn monster are you?
What?... What kind of goddamn monster are you?
It just occurred to me, that she has no witnesses. Anything that she says about us is completely worthless.
It just occurred to me, that she has no witnesses. Anything that she says about us is completely worthless.
Us?
Okay, Lucy, it's time to go meet Barbra...
I felt like a Nazi, but it had to be done.
I gave the cabbie an extra ten bucks to make sure she gets there safe. Also, I told him I'd be there myself in an hour, and if she wasn't, I'd come back out here and rip his lungs out.
That's good. You can't be subtle in this town.
That's good. You can't be subtle in this town.
As your attorney, I advise you to tell me where you put the goddamn mescaline.

Maybe we should take it easy tonight.

Right. Let's find a good seafood restaurant and eat some red salmon. I feel a powerful lust for red salmon...
I saw these bastards in Easy Rider, but I didn't believe they were real. Not like this. Not hundreds of them!
They're actually nice people when you get to know them.
They're actually nice people when you get to know them.
Man, I know these people in my goddamn blood!
Man, I know these people in my goddamn blood!
Don't mention that word around here. You'll get them excited.
Don't mention that word around here. You'll get them excited.
This is a fucking nightmare.
This is a fucking nightmare.
Right. Sure as hell some dope-dealing bomb freak is going to recognize you and put the word out that you're partying with a thousand cops.
Read the newspapers.
Man, you don't know trouble until you have to face down a bunch of these addicts gone crazy for human sacrifice!
Hell, in Malibu alone, these goddamn Satan worshippers kill six or eight people every day. All they want is the blood. They'll take people right off the street if they have to.
Just the other day we had a case where they grabbed a girl right out of a McDonald's hamburger stand. She was a waitress, about sixteen years old... with a lot of people watching, too!
What could they do? The guy that took the head was about six-seven, and maybe three-hundred pounds. He was packing two Lugers, and the others had M-16s.
They just ran back out into Death Valley -- you know, where Manson turned up...
They just ran back out into Death Valley -- you know, where Manson turned up...
Like big lizards.
Like big lizards.
...and every one of them stacked naked...
Yeh, naked!... except for the weapons.
They were all veterans.
What's wrong with you? Hell, somebody has to do it.
Hurry up with those drinks. We're thirsty. Only two rums. Make mine a Bloody Mary.
Sure. It's all on the Q.T., but everybody who matters is with us all the way down the line.
We keep it quiet. It's not the kind of thing you'd want to talk about upstairs. Not with the press around.
Sometimes it's easier to just rip out the backstraps.
They'll fight like hell if you try to take the head without the dogs.
Good work. They'll treat us like goddamn lepers after that.
Lucy is looking for you.
Lucy is looking for you.
No, she's looking for you.
No, she's looking for you.
Me?
Me?
She really flipped over you. The only way I could get rid of her was by saying you were taking me out to the desert for a showdown -- that you wanted me out of the way so you could have her all to yourself. I guess she figures you won. That phone message wasn't for me, was it?
OK, goddamnit!... Look... I'll call her. I'll get her off our backs. You're right. She's my problem.
It's gone too far.
It's gone too far.
Relax. Let me handle this. You'd make a piss-poor lawyer... Room 1600, please. As your attorney, I advise you not to worry. Take a hit out of that little brown bottle in my shaving kit.
What is this?
You won't need much. Just a little tiny taste, that stuff makes pure mescaline seem like ginger-beer. Adrenochrome.
Adrenochrome...
Hi, Lucy? Yeah, it's me. I got your message... what? Hell, no, I taught the bastard a lesson he'll never forget... what? No, not dead, but he won't be bothering anybody for a while. Yeah. I left him out there, I stomped him, then pulled all his teeth out...

I remember thinking, "Jesus, what a terrible thing to lay on somebody with a head full of acid."
I remember slumping on the bed, his performance had given me a bad jolt. For a moment I thought his mind had snapped -- that he actually believed he was being attacked by invisible enemies. But the room was quiet again.
Where'd you get this?
Where'd you get this?
Never mind, it's absolutely pure.
Never mind, it's absolutely pure.
Jesus... what kind of monster client have you picked up this time? There's only one source for this stuff -- the adrenaline gland from a living human body!
I know, but the guy didn't have any cash to pay me. He's one of these Satanism freaks. He offered me human blood -- said it would take me higher than I've ever been in my life. I thought he was kidding, so I told him I'd just as soon have an ounce or so of pure adrenochrome -- or maybe just a fresh
I could already feel the stuff working on me -- the first wave felt like a combination of mescaline and methedrine -- maybe I should take a swim, I thought...
Why not? We should get some of that. Just eat a big handful and see what happens.
Some of what?
Some of what?
Extract of pineal!
Extract of pineal!
Sure. That's a good idea. One whiff of that shit would turn you into something out of a goddamn medical encyclopedia.

Man, your head would swell up like a watermelon, you'd probably gain about a hundred pounds in two hours...
Man, your head would swell up like a watermelon, you'd probably gain about a hundred pounds in two hours...
Right!
Right!
...grow claws... bleeding warts.
...grow claws... bleeding warts.
Yes!
Yes!
...then you'd notice about six huge hairy tits swelling up on your back...
Man I'll try about anything; but I'd never touch a pineal gland.
FINISH THE FUCKING STORY! What happened?! What about the glands?
So do we, lady.
I think we should put her on the payroll. See what she comes up with.
I think we should put her on the payroll. See what she comes up with.
Do you think you can handle it?
Alright, Alice... you'll be contacted by Inspector Rock. Arthur Rock. He'll be posing as a politician.
Inspector Rock will pay you. In cash. A thousand dollars on the ninth of every month.
Fuck the car. They should make these things with a goddamn FM radio.
Yeh... This foreign made crap -- is sucking our dollar balance dry!
There was nothing in the atmosphere of the North Star to put me on my guard...
Two glasses of ice water with ice.
I was stupid with shock -- not knowing whether to run or start laughing.
How much is the lemon meringue pie?
How much is the lemon meringue pie?
Her eyes were turgid with fear, but her brain was functioning on some basic motor survival level.
What are you doing? You were supposed to turn back there!
We had abused every rule that Vegas lived by -- burning the locals, abusing the tourists, terrifying the help. The only chance now, I felt, was the possibility that we'd gone to such excess that nobody in the position to bring the hammer down on us could possibility believe it.
The airport is over there!
Never missed a plane yet.
No! I can't get out! They'll crucify me. I'll have to take the blame!
Ridiculous! Just say you were hitchhiking to the airport and I picked you up. You never saw me before. Shit, this town is full of white Cadillac convertibles. I plan to go through there so fast that nobody will even glimpse the goddamn license plate. You ready?
Ridiculous! Just say you were hitchhiking to the airport and I picked you up. You never saw me before. Shit, this town is full of white Cadillac convertibles. I plan to go through there so fast that nobody will even glimpse the goddamn license plate. You ready?
Why not? But for Christ's sake, just do it fast!
Don't take any guff from those swine. Remember, if you have any trouble you can always send a telegram to the Right People.
Yeah... Explaining my Position. Some asshole wrote a poem about that once...
Please... please... I'm only the maid. I didn't mean nothin!...
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST!
What made you do it? Who paid you off?
Nobody. I'm the maid!
The dope ring. You must know what's going on in this hotel. Why do you think we're here?
I know you're cops, but I thought you were just here for that convention. I swear! All I wanted to do was clean up the room. I don't know anything about dope!
Maybe she's telling the truth. Maybe she's not part of it.
No! I swear I'm not!
You'd pay me for that?
You're damn right. But the first time you say anything about this, to anybody -- you'll go straight to prison for the rest of your life. What's your name?
You're damn right. But the first time you say anything about this, to anybody -- you'll go straight to prison for the rest of your life. What's your name?
Alice. Just ring Linen Service and ask for Alice.
The password is: "One Hand Washes The Other." The minute you hear that, you say "I fear nothing."
I fear nothing.
May I see your license.
Of course, officer.
Could I have that, please?
Why not? It was getting warm anyway.
You realize...
Yeah. I know. I'm guilty. I understand that. I knew it was a crime but I did it anyway. Shit, why argue? I'm a fucking criminal.
Yeah. I know. I'm guilty. I understand that. I knew it was a crime but I did it anyway. Shit, why argue? I'm a fucking criminal.
That's a strange attitude.
You know -- I get the feeling you could use a nap. There's a rest area up ahead. Why don't you pull over and sleep a few hours?
A nap won't help. I've been awake for too long -- three or four nights. I can't even remember. If I go to sleep now, I'm dead for twenty hours.
Okay. Here's how it is. What goes into my book, as of noon, is that I apprehended you... for driving too fast, and advised you to proceed no further than the next rest area... your stated destination, right? Where you plan to take a long nap. Do I make myself clear?
How far is Baker? I was hoping to stop there for lunch.
How far is Baker? I was hoping to stop there for lunch.
Not my jurisdiction. The city limits are two point two miles beyond the rest area. Can you make it that far?
Not my jurisdiction. The city limits are two point two miles beyond the rest area. Can you make it that far?
I'll try. I've been wanting to go to Baker for a long time. I've heard a lot about it.
You're lying! You were after the evidence. Who put you up to this -- the manager?
I don't know what you're talking about!
I don't know what you're talking about!
Bullshit! You're just as much a part of it as they are!
Bullshit! You're just as much a part of it as they are!
Part of what?
Come on, baby don't try to tell us you never heard of the Grange Gorman.
No! No! I swear to Jesus I never heard of that stuff!
In that case, maybe she can help.
Yes! I'll help you all you need! I hate dope!
What?
One phone call every day. Just tell us what you've seen. Don't worry if it doesn't add up, that's our problem.
Oh Lord! I'd do just about anything for that!
You and a lot of other people.
Oh, and don't bother to make up the room. That way we won't have to risk another of these little incidents, will we?
Whatever you say, gentlemen. I can't tell you how sorry I am about what happened...
Whatever you say, gentlemen. I can't tell you how sorry I am about what happened...
Don't worry, it's all over now. Thank God for the decent people.
It serves you right. You cheatin' jerk.
Spare me.
Spare me.
I figure it's karma. You wronged me and you wronged your wife and you wronged your children, so this is karma biting you on the ass, or in your case... ...on the eye.
Stop!
What the fuck are you doing he's in there!
What the fuck are you doing he's in there!
They can't get in here! You said it yourself, they'll get in!
YOU'RE KILLING HIM!
They'll get in! We'll all die!
You can't keep me here. This is bullshit. Fuckin' bullshit. This is fucking BULLSHIT!
We can't risk letting them in.
We can't risk letting them in.
Right.
Careful.
I'm telling you, I don't see a thing --
I will not die because of him!
Don't be stupid, drop the gun!
We should go! We should go right now!
He's right, let's move. Be quiet and get to the exit. Pair up, grab the weapons.
Are you two all right? Did you see that!? They left! We made it! I think we made it!
They'll be back.
They'll be back.
Oh, come on! Can't you be happy for one split second? They're gone!
You know where it is?
Um, yeah, thirty miles east.
We'll meet in three hours?
I don't wanna go home alone... I don't wanna see what might have...
Where are you two going?
We're going to get my little girl.
Sorry, didn't mean to scare you.
Where is everyone?
Where is everyone?
I don't know, I just got here. Did you find your girl?
IS IT CLEAR?!
Yeah.
Yeah.
IS THERE A GUN POINTING AT YOU?
IS THERE A GUN POINTING AT YOU?
Nah, I got the gun.
My god damn foot is gone! Who fuckin' shot me? Who fuckin' shot me!?
Her fella.
Well, it don't look pretty.
But it's got teeth.
I got my .38 here. That's six shots and two refills. Downstairs, I think we got another rifle, maybe a scatterer and some gardening tools. Maybe a couple boxes of shells for The Judge.
I got shells too, box and a half, tops.
I don't think you should...
With what just happened upstairs --
One keg of Beast for the basement, then, truck's dry.
Gonna stay for a couple?
I have a CB in my truck, we could get some help out here.
Who the hell would you call?
Who the hell would you call?
Anyone.
Stop it.
Hey. You noticed that no one's been killed or maimed for awhile?
We shot a skunk.
We're lucky to be alive.
Hey! Get quiet or get out.
C'mon guys--
I think I know where a CB is.
Where's that?
Where's that?
Upstairs.
Okay, now. Easy steps. Easy breaths. Easy steps.
Come on, come on.
Oh!
"OH!?" WHAT IS "OH?" What does "oh" mean?
Wha?
OPEN THE DOOR!
You got something better?
If we move in a group, we are one target. If we scatter, they CAN'T get us all.
We'll be food, dickheads!
Well, your last words can be "I told you so."
Well, your last words can be "I told you so."
You gotta be with me on this.
That's the oldest of the bunch, looked like the Grandpapa. We caught the little one, Junior, in the cooler there. As we've seen, what he lacks in size he more than makes up for in speed.
And the rest of 'em?
And the rest of 'em?
Unfortunately, the worst of 'em are still outside.
And that's how I ended up here.
And the head?
So, your husband ditched you?
No, no, no it was... it was wild out there, no time to think, we just moved. He didn't leave me. He just ran. He just ran.
No, no, no it was... it was wild out there, no time to think, we just moved. He didn't leave me. He just ran. He just ran.
Well, justice is funny.
They're right here.
Hey!
Jesus Christ, I'm gonna have a stroke.
Easy.
Don't bullshit me! If you know a way out of this place and you're holding out --
There's a tunnel.
What tunnel? Where?
It's in the basement, about a hundred yards long. It spits out on the backside of that hill down the way. There's a truck there.
It's in the basement, about a hundred yards long. It spits out on the backside of that hill down the way. There's a truck there.
What's it for?
HEY! No, I'm not trusting him either, that's why you and I will both be going with him.
What!? I'm not going down there again!
What!? I'm not going down there again!
This is it! This is our only way out! They have this place surrounded. We go out the front, we're dead. We go out the back, we're dead, but if we go UNDER them... we might just make it. Now, who else is in? Seven can go.
This is it! This is our only way out! They have this place surrounded. We go out the front, we're dead. We go out the back, we're dead, but if we go UNDER them... we might just make it. Now, who else is in? Seven can go.
This is a bottleneck waiting to happen.
You all sure about this?
Follow me.
Where's the tunnel?
In the corner, behind the curtain.
We just smeared a skunk.
Shit!
I'm gonna shoot him if they don't get him first.
Just move!
You seem mighty collected about this.
Buddy, I'm a full-blooded Chucktow. I can't think of a time my people haven't been takin' it dry. The fact that we are being eaten now, doesn't even faze me... ...this is just another Tuesday.
You're trusting that guy? He'll ditch us and never look back.
Fuck you too.
Fuck you too.
Get in line!
Scared?
No. You?
No. You?
Of course not. I fight monsters all the time.
I'd love to be macho, but this is a pants wetter from all angles.
The door... on three.
Ohhh.
What?
What?
Look.
That's an unwise thing to say, you know that?
Just an observation.
Just an observation.
Well, why don't you keep your observations to yourself?
So, what now? Did those things leave?
Why don't you go check it out?
Why don't you go check it out?
Fuck no.
Any more ideas Animal Planet?
You weren't helpin'.
You weren't helpin'.
Go douche.
I'm telling ya, you got the cloth too deep, you're asking for it.
Oh yeah?
Do you drive a short beer bus or something? You go out there you get eaten, you stay in here you get eaten, anyone comes to help they get eaten. Don't you see a pattern here, Spuds Makenzie?
Well then I guess we should just give up.
Well then I guess we should just give up.
Believe me, I'd love to save the day and get some heroic snatch. But it's not in the cards, partner.
We're better off.
Who's with me?
Come on!
He's dead.
What now, Geronimo?
My truck.
Why do you take shit from him?
Look, yeah, he's an ass, but he's my brother. Que sera-sera.
Look, yeah, he's an ass, but he's my brother. Que sera-sera.
Your brother, huh?
Your brother, huh?
Yep.
Yep.
Your parents of relation?
Your parents of relation?
We lived near power lines.
I'm in.
Anyone else?
We're going to get help.
We gotta try.
We gotta try.
Anybody else?
We gotta be close.
What?
All right! Tell us about the truck!
Uh, uh, I think if we can get everyone into it... we can get out of here.
My truck can't be more than ten feet away. We load into the back, I can get in the front and we roll out of here.
What's in the back?
What's in the back?
Nothing, this was my last delivery.
Yeah, the lot's right there. My truck is right out back.
But not flush against the tunnel?
It's imperative that you get that truck moving.
Just cover me. It was built to move.
How are you holding up?
Well...
Push and twist, it's child proof.
Oh.
Oh.
Gimme a couple dabs on the tongue.
What is this?
Magic potion. You should try a little.

Oh, no.

It'll calm your nerves. Works like a charm.

Will I go crazy or something?

No, no, it calms you, makes everything nice and smooth. Just takes the edge off like a beer, but in a fraction of the time.
No, no, it calms you, makes everything nice and smooth. Just takes the edge off like a beer, but in a fraction of the time.
Why not then?
Wait, before you do that, help me to the kitchen, I need to lay down. There's a cot back there.
But --
But --
It's much safer in there, sweety.
It's much safer in there, sweety.
Okay then.
Doesn't your foot hurt?
I can't feel a thing, Hon.
Um-hmmm.
The girl's got rhythm.
You wanna see, baby?
Sure.
Sure.
How much you got?
How much you got?
How much I got, what?
How much you got to see the show?
You don't understand sweety, Daddy doesn't pay, Daddy sees the show for free. But you do get points for being horny on a night like this.
What? Really?
Uh huh, now wiggle that sweet little ass over here and sit on Daddy's face, I wanna do some appraising.
My husband...
Well, where's the sonuvabitch!?
Well, where's the sonuvabitch!?
He's dead.
He's dead.
What?
Jesus Christ on the cross... Someone make sense.
Easy. We're surrounded by something the likes none of you have ever seen before. Some kind of animals. Real fast, volatile, predators. ONE went through three of your patrons like they were Kleenex.

So, your dead hubby shot me twice, three of my customers have been eaten, and there are angry creatures outside?

He only shot you once.

Huh?

He shot you the other time.
Will these boards hold?
The boards are solid oak planks, and the floor is reinforced by a steel grid beneath. Nothing real or supernatural is busting through this, least nothing the size of the beasts.

Good.
In the kitchen, under the sink.
No one goes anywhere alone. Least of all, unarmed.
Go for it. It's by the far wall. A small wave band. Channel 9 is the emergency frequency. But I don't see the point.
You're wasting your time, there's no one out there.

I think that's for bears and sharks, chunky chew.
I wouldn't do that, son.
They're probably on to the next buffet by now. There's a retirement home up the road. They'd be easy.
I'll go with ya.
What are you gonna do? Throw your teeth at 'em? Sit down, Cocoon.
Welcome back.
F-f-fuck you.
They were all over the place.
You smell like ass!
Look, the armed surround the unarmed in a circle and we move as a tight group. Those that can shoot, protect the rest to his ride.
Hey, when this plan completely goes to shit, what are ya gonna do?
Bullshit.
No bullshit.
Clever fuckers.
What the hell's going on here!?
Blow the goddamn hatch!
Clear!
Got 'cha!
HOLD THAT TIGHT!
'Eh, Chief?
Duh hickey.
Fine, Chief.
Gimme the keys.
Gimme the keys.
NO, but I will lock you in.
NO, but I will lock you in.
What?
What?
We'll be on the other side waiting for you. If you become food I don't want the only set of keys in the belly of one of those things. It's your funeral.
You are taking a chance that is not worth the risk.
Well, we are one miracle short tonight. So, just guard the stairs?
Well, we are one miracle short tonight. So, just guard the stairs?
Done. But you're locked in. Will you hold the keys?
What?!
Move slow and move quiet.
Move slow and move quiet.
No shit.
Move it!
You keep that key handy.
Shit!
I'm fine! I'm fine!
JUST A BAT! I'M FINE! JUST A BAT! SORRY!
If he doesn't shut up...
Hurry!
REPEAT. WE NEED HELP. SOS. CALLING ALL CARS! WE NEED HELP AT THE UNITED NATIONS TAV--!
SHIT.
MOVE YOUR ASS!
COME ON!
HELLLLLLLLP!!
Yeah, maybe.
Get something on that.
Where the hell are we going to go then, Billy Jack!?
There's a bomb shelter over in Durant, by the IGA, on First. You all know where that is?
You don't want the rag to touch the booze, that way you can hold it awhile and ensure it explodes when you throw it.
You sure? I thought the rag had to touch?
You sure? I thought the rag had to touch?
I'm sure.
HELP MEEE!
BONSAI!
I'm in a wheelchair, the truck sounds pretty good.
Amazing you made it this far.
Nothin' will happen to you. You get on my back, hold on tight and we truck out of here together.
Am I too heavy for you?
Am I too heavy for you?
Don't worry, you'll be like my little papoose.
OH JESUS!
HELLLPPP!
Well, maybe they migrate?
As long as it's dark, they're around. They hide, wait for you to drop your guard, and then attack.
Hey!
Everyone take a role. Let's prepare the guns, ammo and whatever else we can scare up. We also need to help the hurt so we can move them on our ultimate exit outta here. So, who's going into the basement with me?
Okay, well... anybody else have an idea?
Is there any other way out of this place? ANYONE?
Yeah, I'll go.
Ok. Let's see what happens.
Let's move.
I'm done drinking. That's it. Just Church and grocery stores. Nothin' else.
Do we have anything else to defend ourselves with? Anything?
Right. Were going to need some fire power. Do you have any sort of guns or ammunition here? Anything at all?
What's wrong?
Nothing, just lookin'.
Let's go.
She's not very nice, is she?
DON'T!
YOU'LL HIT US!
Let's wait it out.
They'll tear this place down within the hour.
If you are face to face with her, dive left.
And the last one is the...
And the last one is the...
Father. The biggest, the strongest...
Okay, well that's something.
So we've got guns, kitchen knives, pipes, fire and sticks.
There's a rifle and a shotgun here.
That's fine.
Hold it!
Whoa!
Let's go!
Wait God-dammit!
If there is only one way out for us, there is only one way in for them.
Make a distraction out front and go for it out the back. There's cars back there, right?
Go! Go!
Not without you!!!
Not without you!!!
Go!!!
Get to your cars!
GO-GO-GO!!
Oh my God... What is that?
That's one piece of four problems.
Cody! Cody are you all right? Mommy's coming! Mommy's coming, baby! Don't move! Mommy's coming!
Stop her!
Oh sweetheart! What was I thinking? Mommy is never gonna let you go. Oh Jesus... Never, ever, never let you go.
Let's lock off this room.
Shut up! Shut your mouth. You have no idea what is running through me right now. No idea. I'm ready.
All right.
You know you don't have to do this.
I'm fine, I really am.
I'm fine, I really am.
I admire your strength.
I admire your strength.
We all have to be strong, right?
We all have to be strong, right?
Right.
Her name is Charlie.
Oh...
Oh...
She's still alive, I hope. I wouldn't have made it this far if it weren't for the chance of seeing my little girl again. I need to get to her.

I'll do anything to help.

I know. Thanks. Just don't tell anyone I have a soft side.
I know. Thanks. Just don't tell anyone I have a soft side.
Deal.
We should stick together out there.
I'd love to.
Did we make it?
I think --
Hey little bear, aren't you going to join the others?
Um, my allergist told me not to engage in physically demanding activities where ragweed or spores might be present, sir.
Do you have a note to corroborate these claims?
Um, well...
Um, well...
Are you lying to me?
Are you lying to me?
Well...
Well...
What did we say about lying?
What did we say about lying?
I'm not lying.
I'm not lying.
You know that no one likes a liar, right?
You know that no one likes a liar, right?
I said I'm not lying.
What have you done now, broke the darn thing?
I just hit it like you said.
Well... come on.
This is a mistake. No. This is a disaster.
This is a mistake. No. This is a disaster.
Come on, it's just what you need! Let everyone see you. Talk to them, live it up!
Come on, it's just what you need! Let everyone see you. Talk to them, live it up!
But we've been at it since six this morning. At least you could've let me go home and change.
But we've been at it since six this morning. At least you could've let me go home and change.
Look, Frances, I didn't want this job. Think I'm crazy? But you begged me: improve your image. So please... lemme try, huh?
Look, Frances, I didn't want this job. Think I'm crazy? But you begged me: improve your image. So please... lemme try, huh?
You're right. I'm sorry. Okay, let's go get 'em.

So not only am I a troublesome bitch, but I'm fat too?
So not only am I a troublesome bitch, but I'm fat too?
Come on. They make you feel nice and peppy.
Frances? Oh no.
Refill my drink, will you, Bob?

What're you doing?

Putting on my armor.

Come on, Frances. Louella Parsons is here. She wants to talk to you, help you out.
Come on, Frances. Louella Parsons is here. She wants to talk to you, help you out.
Louella... didn't she call me a spoiled little bitch?
Louella... didn't she call me a spoiled little bitch?
Come on, she's an important columnist! What's the matter? I thought you wanted these people to forgive you.
Come on, she's an important columnist! What's the matter? I thought you wanted these people to forgive you.
'Forgive'...? For What?
'Forgive'...? For What?
I'm sorry... that was an unfortunate choice of words.
And on top of her political activities, now she's got a lawyer. She wants out of her contract, Mr. Bebe. She says she's through with motion pictures.
I'm sure it wasn't me, it wasn't me...
I'm sure it wasn't me, it wasn't me...
Excuse me, sir?
Excuse me, sir?
I don't know who she fucked to get where she is, but I don't think it was me.
Well... you could always dump her, Mr. Bebe. Teach her a lesson. There are a million beautiful girls out there who don't give a damn about politics.
That's not the point. Frances Farmer has the world by the tit because of this studio, and now she thinks she can waltz off without a thank you. No. No, that young lady has a contract, and she's going to honor it.

Oh. I mean, good.
Oh. I mean, good.
I think it's time to take the gloves off. Get me some reporters. Particularly Louella Parsons!
Good morning, Mr. Bebe!
Who's this?
Who's this?
Frances Farmer, contract player, six- month option.

Okay. Good tits. Can't we show them off a little more?
Okay. Good tits. Can't we show them off a little more?
I guess so, sir.
I guess so, sir.
Very fine bone structure.
That's Frances. I'm not the cookbook.
You see: We've got to change that name.
I like your looks. You have the classical bone structure of the very great beauties... Garbo, Dietrich --
Thank you --
Thank you --
I intend to make a great deal of money off you.
Since we have you on a seven year contract, I'm planning long-range. I'm going to loan you out to Sam Goldwyn to make a picture called "Come and Get It."
Really? That's a very good book. It'd make a terrific --
Really? That's a very good book. It'd make a terrific --
Never mind that. I'm concerned about you. Your attitude.
Society is falling apart, Miss Farmer, and people have to buckle down, do their jobs. You see, I view myself as the Henry Ford of motion picture industry, and I can't have the fellow who puts on the wheels arguing with the man who installs head-lights, now can I?
But I'm concerned with everything, Mr. Bebe.
But I'm concerned with everything, Mr. Bebe.
No, I'm concerned with everything.
No, I'm concerned with everything.
But I'm the one up there on the screen.
But I'm the one up there on the screen.
That's right. You're an actress, Miss Farmer and your job is to act.
Look, Mr. Bebe, you can hold me to my contract, but you can't break me. I'm back, and I'm gonna make the best of it.
I'd like nothing better.
Hi Frances, got a minute?
Sure, Claire. If you don't mind walking my way.
Well, I suppose I should just say it. It's your clothes.
My clothes?
My clothes?
Yeah, I mean slacks... and work clothes... and that awful car --
Yeah, I mean slacks... and work clothes... and that awful car --
It's a perfectly good car. It runs.
It's a perfectly good car. It runs.
Yes, but... Really, I hate to sound... it's just that the public expects something different from its stars. People won't take you seriously.

I don't care if my clothes are taken seriously. Or my car.
You know what I mean.
You know what I mean.
Uh-huh. You mean what if the public finds out I perspire? And wear slacks. And drive an old jalopy? What if they find out I'm a real person. Oh no! Say it ain't so! Not a real person!
That's not all, Frances. Mr. Bebe is very concerned about your politics. He hears you've been donating money, speaking at rallies.
Yup. Claire... please, please tell Mr. Bebe that if he worried half as much about his scripts as he does about my private life, we'd make a lot better movies.

I'm sorry, Frances. It's my job, you know?

I know. 'This is a factory and we each have our jobs. The writer writes, the director directs, and the actress...'

Face it! Confess it! You're weak!
I'm not!
I'm not!
You're afraid!

I'm not!

You don't want to show your whole soul -- ugly, mis-shapen, and pitiful -- you don't want to show it --

God damn it, Clifford, will you shut up! I tell you, I want to give these things! I want to give them to the audience, and I can give them, I will give them, so shut up!
Good, good. Give them that.
What?
Madam...?
Thank you.
Oh my God! Frances, I'm such a cad. I can't go through with this. My wife is in Europe, but this is her house... her bedroom. I can't ask you to...
Oh well. I guess I better leave then.
Okay, but come here first.
Huh.
Huh.
Come here. I want to show you something.
The Group is more than a theatre company. It's the embodiment of an ideal. Our approach allows the actor to be an artist in the fullest sense, a creative individual and an instrument of change. You see --
Really, Mr. Clurman, you don't have to sell me.
Really, Mr. Clurman, you don't have to sell me.
Forgive my indulgence. Seems we always lecture those who are on time for those who are tardy. The point is, Mr. Odets here has written a wonderful play. Most of the roles are cast, but we haven't found our female lead...

Who is she?
...Not only an artist, but an instrument of change. We must look to the world around us, not content to observe, but to take an active hand in redressing its wrongs. We will not stand idly by as Fascist bombs obliterate democracy. We contribute our profits, for if fascism is not stopped in Spain, it will spread across Europe, jeopardizing the struggle of civilized
I'm not afraid of struggle, Clifford.
Hello, Harold.
Frances.
Frances.
Where's Clifford?
Where's Clifford?
He's not here.
He's not here.
Oh.
What's up?
I hear you're meeting with the studio lawyers to get out of your contract.

That's right. I don't want them breathing down my neck while we're in London.
That's right. I don't want them breathing down my neck while we're in London.
Well... well, you see, that's the point. You won't be opening in London.
You don't think I'm good enough?
What?! Good Lord no, it's just... It's money. We needed backing and... well, we found it.
What?! Good Lord no, it's just... It's money. We needed backing and... well, we found it.
Who?
Who?
An actress.

A rich actress.

Yes. That's the deal. She plays Lorna.
Yes. That's the deal. She plays Lorna.
But... but wait a minute. We're supposed to be different, right? Clifford says... This theatre is supposed to be different! And this play... this play is all about what greed and money do to people!

Right now we have to be practical.

Does Clifford even know? You didn't tell him, did you? I'm gonna tell him. Where is he?
Does Clifford even know? You didn't tell him, did you? I'm gonna tell him. Where is he?
He knows, Frances.
Hey, where's the fire, sister?
In my eyes, officer.
In my eyes, officer.
Cool off, beautiful. Didn't you see the sign says "Dimout Zone?" There's a war on, you know?
Cool off, beautiful. Didn't you see the sign says "Dimout Zone?" There's a war on, you know?
Come on. You're seriously trying to tell me the Japs can't find Los Angeles without my headlights?
Come on. You're seriously trying to tell me the Japs can't find Los Angeles without my headlights?
I didn't make the law, lady. I just enforce it.
Get your clothes on.
You have no right! You have no fucking right, you bastards! Get the hell out of here --

You're under arrest.
You learn your lines?
Sort of.
Sort of.
There've been some calls.
There've been some calls.
Who?
Who?
Well... about half an hour ago that woman from the talent department called, what's her name?

Yeah, Claire. She said she was fired. Too bad, huh?
Yeah, Claire. She said she was fired. Too bad, huh?
Fired?
Fired?
Yeah. She said she delivered your message and that you'd understand.
There was another call too. From your agent. He says your summer stock deal is all set. So you're going back east, huh?
...Yes.
...Yes.
Without me.
Without me.
Showdown.
Showdown.
You weren't going to tell me, were you? Just pack up and leave, is that it?

Dwayne! I'm Dwayne now! And you damn well better get used to it!
Dwayne! I'm Dwayne now! And you damn well better get used to it!
Dick...
Dick...
I don't suppose it occurred to you that I might want to leave too, that I might want to do theatre? No, 'cause you don't want me along, do you? And the reason has nothing to do with summer stock.
I don't suppose it occurred to you that I might want to leave too, that I might want to do theatre? No, 'cause you don't want me along, do you? And the reason has nothing to do with summer stock.
No?
No?
No. It's all about that night, isn't it?
No. It's all about that night, isn't it?
What night?
What night?
The premiere. I never pressed you about it but god damn it, you're gonna tell me right here and right now what happened and where the hell you were!
The premiere. I never pressed you about it but god damn it, you're gonna tell me right here and right now what happened and where the hell you were!
You want his name?
Oh, God! Let's get her out of here tonight, right now! Let's take her with us!
The hearing's tomorrow. If she gets out legally, they can't come after her.
The hearing's tomorrow. If she gets out legally, they can't come after her.
Look at her! She'll never pass that sanity test tomorrow...
Look at her! She'll never pass that sanity test tomorrow...
I'm taking care of that, Harry. Just hold her. Reserpine. I guarantee you this'll clear her head. She'll wake up feeling smart and sailright through the hearing.
Let's get out of here! I'll lose my job!
Frances, we gotta do it this way. Just remember tomorrow, remember what I told you. What're you gonna tell 'em?
Harry!
I gotta go now.
We're all square now, Harry. Right?
All square, Doc.
All square, Doc.
Good. 'Cause I don't want to see you again.
Doctor, it may sound odd, but I believe I've profited from my stay here. It's just what I've needed, to get away like this. But I'm recuperated now. I've had lots of time to think and I've made a few decisions about my life. I'm ready to get on with it.
I know you believe that.
I know you believe that.
...Don't you?
...Don't you?
I'm afraid not. You see, we observe things that you're unaware of: signs, indicators. Your problem cuts very deep, Frances, and we have to get at that deeper stuff so that when you do get out, you'll really feel secure. Does that make sense?
No. Cut this runaround, Doctor. I know better.
Listen to yourself, Frances. The resistance, the anger in your voice.
Listen to yourself, Frances. The resistance, the anger in your voice.
You... I'm sorry, forgive me. Doctor, tell me honestly, what do I have to do to get out of here?
You... I'm sorry, forgive me. Doctor, tell me honestly, what do I have to do to get out of here?
Be patient, that's all. Take an interest in your treatment and don't dwell on your resentments. You'll be yourself again, I assure you.
Be patient, that's all. Take an interest in your treatment and don't dwell on your resentments. You'll be yourself again, I assure you.
...I see.

We'll talk more about this. I'll see you later.
We'll talk more about this. I'll see you later.
One question. If I'm not myself now, just who do you think I am?
Harry? Oh Harry, I knew you'd come. I love you, Harry. I love... Take me home, Harry.
We'll get you home, Frances.
We'll get you home, Frances.
Thank you, Harry.
This is the answer: a subscription drive to "Voice of Action!" First prize is a trip to Moscow! You could visit the art theatre, maybe even meet Stanislavski!
But I'll never win that.
But I'll never win that.
Yes, yes, it's all arranged. Everyone's collecting subscriptions in your name. And the best part is: the trip returns you to New York.

Thank you.
...until finally your mother finds it necessary to commit you to a state mental institution. Were you mentally ill, Frances?
...No, Ralph. I don't believe I ever was sick. But when you're treated like a patient long enough, you're apt to act like one...
Were you an alcoholic?
No.
No.
Were you a drug addict?
Were you a drug addict?
No. Never.
Thank you, Ralph.
Thank you, Frances. And after the show we're hosting a reception for you and your friends at Hollywood's own Roosevelt Hotel!
Bye, baby.
See you next weekend, Dad.
I'm... I'm really proud of you, Frances.
Thanks, Dad.
Thanks, Dad.
An essay contest... a national contest. That's pretty impressive.

I didn't have much to do with it.

You wrote it, didn't you?

Yeah, I suppose... Dad, who's Harry York?
Yeah, I suppose... Dad, who's Harry York?
Well, Harry York is a guy who... well, he does a lot of things. Why do you ask?
Well, Harry York is a guy who... well, he does a lot of things. Why do you ask?
He talked to me today. Told me to keep my mouth shut or I'd get everybody in trouble.
He talked to me today. Told me to keep my mouth shut or I'd get everybody in trouble.
Yeah... well... it's possible. Harry York and I both work for Mr. Kaminski right now, and... well... There are lots of folks in this country who never got a square break. That's the way of things, but Mr. Kaminski wants to change it, and when it comes to new ideas, the people in power get nervous.

Is Kaminski a Communist?
Is Kaminski a Communist?
No, no, no. All he wants to do is see the common man get a little representation.
No, no, no. All he wants to do is see the common man get a little representation.
He's a socialist, then?
It's already started, Dad... with me.
I know.
I know.
And I can't understand how it can hurt to be honest, but the more I tried to explain --
Dad, please, don't leave early. Just because of Mama --
Francie, you'll learn that sometimes it's best to stay low and just walk away.
What do I do, Dad?
You really want to go?
You really want to go?
Of course.
Of course.
And you think it's worth all this?
And you think it's worth all this?
If I didn't, I wouldn't put you through it.
If I didn't, I wouldn't put you through it.
...Then go.
I love you, Mama. I love you, Dad.
Be careful, Francie.
...So what do you think?
I don't know, honey. Your mother has such big plans for you.
I don't know, honey. Your mother has such big plans for you.
I know that, Dad, but --
I know that, Dad, but --
What you have to understand, Francie, is that she... well... she wanted so much for herself too, and for me, and she never really got to... The only time I ever saw her happy was if her name was in the papers... but she could have been... if times were different she could have been a politician or... I don't know.

But Dad, I'm asking about me. What do you think I should do?
But Dad, I'm asking about me. What do you think I should do?
Well, Francie, sometimes after you get your hands on something you want, it just doesn't look the same. Then you have to be real smart to know if you should hold onto it because it's all you've got... or just let it go. This is the way of things, but I guess you already know that.

Dad... whatever I decide, will it be okay with you?
Dad... whatever I decide, will it be okay with you?
Always. Always.
I'm sorry, I... I don't have a desk in my room, and...
I don't care, Dad. I love you.
I don't care, Dad. I love you.
I love you too, Francie.
Francie, you know I can't do that.
Why? It's such a simple thing. You just let me out and I disappear down a road and you never have to see me again.
Why? It's such a simple thing. You just let me out and I disappear down a road and you never have to see me again.
They'll just catch you again, Francie. Besides, your mother will know.
Dad, here! You don't have to stop, just slow down. You can tell Mama I jumped out. She knows that's the kind of thing I'd do. She won't blame you.
But I gave her my word. Besides, she's still your legal guardian. My hands are tied.
You know where you're taking me. You know what she'll do. Just give me a minute, slow down, give me an instant for once in your life, please?
Please, Francie...

I pity us, Dad. I pity us both.
It always amazes me, Lil, how you can whip up a hot, hearty meal out of thin air.
I can thank you for that. It was a hard-earned talent.
Bread?
Thank you.
Thank you.

No, Lil. It's just you can't understand their brand of patriotism.
No, Lil. It's just you can't understand their brand of patriotism.
That's right. I can't understand a man who puts strangers over his family, a man who gives up a good career to become a shiftless inkhorn failure.
I'm going back to the hotel.
Good.

See you next weekend?
See you next weekend?
As usual. Everything as usual, Mr. Farmer. Just give me my due.

You're not the quiet type, Frances.
You know, my old man was an inventor. Spent his whole life down in the basement trying to design transcontinental underground railroads, stuff like that. Well, I was supposed to be his partner. When I told him the smell of his workshop made me sick, I thought he was going to die right there.
What happened to him?
What happened to him?
He retired to Florida... made a killing in vending machines.
I kick myself sometimes, but the thing is, I would have been miserable living his life.
...So you think I should go.

How ya doin', Farmer?
Me? Look at you! What're you doing in Hollywood?
Me? Look at you! What're you doing in Hollywood?

Well, the studio told me not to.

You know, the funny thing is: it's not a great movie. I mean it could've been, but they screwed it up, gave it a happy ending. And all my friends, I know they're going to smile and say they loved it.
If they say they love it, they'll probably love it. Not everybody lies, you know?
If they say they love it, they'll probably love it. Not everybody lies, you know?
No, they don't, do they?
Frances, you're a movie star now. If you give them what they want, you can get anything.
I don't have what they want, Harry. Harry, will you tell me something? How can I keep making movies when people in the streets are starving?
I don't have what they want, Harry. Harry, will you tell me something? How can I keep making movies when people in the streets are starving?

Don't tell me what to do, just give me his head on a platter!
Two lines! Two fucking lines! 'My wife returns from Europe tomorrow. I can't see you any more.' Just like that!

For not chopping off his head and serving it to me on a platter.
For not chopping off his head and serving it to me on a platter.
Well, I would have, you know? I just didn't know how to cook it.
Six months' probation...? You gotta learn when to do battle, Farmer. You're not going to win many bouts with 200 pound cops.
I took the early rounds.
I took the early rounds.
I'll bet.

So you drink, and you fight with a cop...?
So you drink, and you fight with a cop...?

No, Harry, I can't --
No, Harry, I can't --
You're coming.
I just wanted to be part of something... one thing, one play or one movie, something that was really fine... memorable. And I could say: I did that, I made something good.
And?
And?
Well... to get a crack at something good, you gotta earn it, you gotta climb the ladder first. So you do, you work hard, and all these people behind you are pushing you up, shouting you on. And then one day you realize you are, you're at the top... and there's nothing there. And you look behind you and there's no one below. You're
Take a walk, pal.

I don't know. Not a war exactly. It's more a... a misapprehension maybe...
Huh?
Huh?
A misunderstanding, people taking the wrong meaning from things. I wasn't declaring war, Harry. I was just saying my prayers.
Harry, I have to go home. I have to talk to Mama.
Frances, you're fulla drugs. You don't know what you're saying. Who do you think put you into Meadow Wood? Your mother thinks you're crazy and she'll keep on thinking it as long as it suits her.

Look, Frances, I'm only gonna ask this one time. I mean it. I swear after this, I'll never ask again: Will you marry me?
I know a thing or two about marriage. You... you understand me more than anyone, Harry... maybe even more than Mama. But... you're too important to me. I'd fail you. I don't know how or why, but I would. And that's a chance I just can't take. Do you understand?

There's just one more thing.
What's that?
What's that?
Will you marry me?
It's not too late to keep going, up to Vancouver? Be the smartest thing.
Thanks, Harry, really, but... I can't explain it. She's my mother. She's just... I can't give up on her that easy.

I love you, Harry. I love you.
I love you too, Frances.
Where to?
Oh Harry...
This is it, kid. This is our chance. When you got a chance, you better take it.
Yeah. I don't know.

You don't need to screw around anymore. You don't need Dwayne Steele or Odets or your mother. You need me.
You don't need to screw around anymore. You don't need Dwayne Steele or Odets or your mother. You need me.
I know, but... There were so many people in there, Harry. Every time I turned around someone was pressing against me... watching, looking over my shoulder, touching me, grabbing, sticking things into me. When I feel somebody near me now... anybody... my skin starts to crawl.
Been a lot of years, you know. A long time waiting. For what? End up feeling like a sap.
Oh please, Harry... don't even think it. You're the only person who ever... It's just... Can't you wait for me?
Oh please, Harry... don't even think it. You're the only person who ever... It's just... Can't you wait for me?

You're Farmer? Oh... Well, look, they took your stuff out. Moved it to some hotel, I think.

What?
What?
I'm preparin' it for the next tenant, he's coming in tomorrow.
And what's the title of this seduc... assault?
'Golden Boy.'
That's me, Clifford.
I know, but I'm not seeing it. It's there, Frances, the fire is there, but it's not coming through. You're lazy --
I'm not!
Yes, you win them, you bring them into your heart, touch them, but you don't set them on fire!
Yes, you win them, you bring them into your heart, touch them, but you don't set them on fire!
But I want to. I'm trying!
But I want to. I'm trying!
I need an incendiary! An arsonist!

Then show me! That's what I'm here for, to learn, to grow!
Then show me! That's what I'm here for, to learn, to grow!
Good. Then it's very simple. You have to stop being afraid, Frances. It's in you.
'But how do I know you love me?'
Your big speech?
Your big speech?
'How do I know it's true? You'll get to be the champ. They'll all want you, all the girls! But I don't care. I've been undersea a long time. When they'd put their hands on me I used to say, "This isn't it! This isn't what I mean!" It's been a mysterious world for me! But Joe, I think you're it! I don't know

I already have.
How's it sound?
The speech? Real good.
The speech? Real good.
You think I got it?
You think I got it?
You got it.
You got it.
Yeah. Yeah, tonight I think I got it.
Mama...
I'm not hungry. You two just enjoy yourselves. After all, this is a celebration.
Don't listen to him, little sister. When you're proud of what you are, you don't refuse the label, understand?
Yes, Ma.
Yes, Ma.
And you... should be proud. You won that contest and made a name for yourself.
But they're using you!
Oh Ma, they're not using me. It's just a chance to travel, see things. Besides, it's the only way I can get to New York.
I'll pay your way to New York. I'll work, I'll slave. I'll sell my vegetables to the truck farmers, or --
Oh, Mama, don't you understand?
It isn't in your hands, Mama. It's my life.
Yes, but important people are concerned about this. Judge Hillier spoke to Alma Styles --
Yes, but important people are concerned about this. Judge Hillier spoke to Alma Styles --
I don't care.
I don't care.
...You will.
It's okay.
Smile, little sister, smile.
It's alright now, little sister, everything's going to be just fine.
Mama, what's...
Mama, what's...
Shhh, shhh. You're not going to jail, Frances. The Judge has put you under my care. I'll see you get the rest you need.
Shhh, shhh. You're not going to jail, Frances. The Judge has put you under my care. I'll see you get the rest you need.
You're taking me home!
Tell them who I am! Tell them who I am!
Are you crazy? Unhand that woman! That's Amelia Earhart!
And here's one from nice Mr. Zeiss. He says that...
Why are these all opened?
Why are these all opened?
Well, they needed immediate answers, Frances. It's good manners and good sense. You shouldn't be bothering yourself with these right now.
Well, they needed immediate answers, Frances. It's good manners and good sense. You shouldn't be bothering yourself with these right now.
Then why did you bring them?
Then why did you bring them?
It's your fan mail, little sister.
It's your fan mail, little sister.
You kill me, Mama.
You kill me, Mama.
What?
What?
Go on...
Well, who have we here...?
Frances, you remember my lawyer, Alma Styles?
Oh Mama, I'm so... tired of that song.
Please. I want you to. It would make me so happy.
I think I need a little air.
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
Nothing. I think I'll just go out for awhile.
Nothing. I think I'll just go out for awhile.
Where are you going?
Where are you going?
For a walk, Mama. Just a walk.
How long will you be?
Not long.
I'll have lunch ready by one.
I'll be back.
I'll be back.
At one. Promise?
At one. Promise?
Sure.
Say you promise.
I promise I'll... I promise, Mama.
You know, the surest way to lose an appetite, is to drink, little sister.
Yes, Mama.
Yes, Mama.
I don't want you drinking, Frances.
I don't want you drinking, Frances.
Yes, Mama.
I'm back, Mama.
Oh Frances, do I have news for you! Guess who --
Oh Frances, do I have news for you! Guess who --
Wait, Mama, wait. I have something to tell you. I've decided... well... I'm not going to make movies anymore. I thought that's what I wanted, and I went after it with all my soul, the way you taught me, but I was miserable, Mama, and it nearly killed me. So now... now it's over. I want a different kind of life, something... simple. I
Don't... talk crazy.
Mama...?
Mama...?
They want you back! Your agent called today! Don't you understand? He's sending the scripts. He wants to fly up here in a week with the publicity people! Frances, you can't do this to your fans! Why, they've been praying for you all through this nightmare. You can't turn your back on them now! Look at this fan mail I've been answering!
Haven't you heard what I said?
I told him to come up! I told him you wanted to show them all that there's nothing wrong with you any more, that you're completely cured!
I told him to come up! I told him you wanted to show them all that there's nothing wrong with you any more, that you're completely cured!
I'm not cured. I was never sick! They had no business putting me in there! My only responsibility is to myself now!
I'm not cured. I was never sick! They had no business putting me in there! My only responsibility is to myself now!
You... you selfish, selfish child. At least talk to him, hear what he has to say.
You... you selfish, selfish child. At least talk to him, hear what he has to say.
No!
No!
You want to throw it all away, is that it? You had everything, little sister. Beauty... a brilliant career... a wonderful husband. You were a movie star!
You want to throw it all away, is that it? You had everything, little sister. Beauty... a brilliant career... a wonderful husband. You were a movie star!
Mama, shut up!
Mama, shut up!
And now you're throwing everything away? You're gonna be a nobody! Nobody! You know what that's like?!
And now you're throwing everything away? You're gonna be a nobody! Nobody! You know what that's like?!
You... You'd send me back, wouldn't you? You would.
Where are you going?
I'm going out!
I'm going out!
You're not going anywhere!
You're not going anywhere!
Yes, I am, and you can't stop me! You can't tell me what to do, mother. I'm a grown woman, and I can decide about my own life.
Yes, I am, and you can't stop me! You can't tell me what to do, mother. I'm a grown woman, and I can decide about my own life.
Frances!
Of course, she hasn't anything definite in mind.
No. No, it all depends on what offers I get.
Oh, just leave those things for now.
No, Mama, I'll take care of it. I'll wash them in the morning.
You know, little sister, I never resented you for refusing to see me in the... the hospital. I knew you had to manage on your own before you could come back.
Thank you for understanding, Mama.
Little sister, I don't want you to feel any rush to get back to work. I want you to rest... for a while anyway.
I will, I promise.
Do I go right away or do I have time to take a bath?
I was hoping for a kind word, little sister.
I was hoping for a kind word, little sister.
You were hoping for a kind word?! You're my mother! You're supposed to nourish me! Support me!
You were hoping for a kind word?! You're my mother! You're supposed to nourish me! Support me!
I have!
No! All you've done is try to break my spirit, try to turn me into you! But I'm not you, mother, and I never will be, and thank god for it! That goes for you too! And frankly, I don't know how, with the two of you, I turned out as sane as I am -- Wait right there, gentlemen, I'll be with you
But what --
But what --
No! You're not talking now. You listen. You can send me away, Lillian, you can pretend I'm crazy and pretend I'm still your little girl who can't take care of herself, but one thing you can't pretend anymore. You can't pretend I love you because I don't. I can't. Not after what you've done to me. Because you see... I'm still me... I'm trying
On behalf of the Seattle Ladies Club, as a token of our vast admiration --
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Yes...?
Yes...?
Don't I know you?
Don't I know you?
I don't believe so.
I don't believe so.
Sure. You shouted at me in the auditorium when I read my essay.
Sure. You shouted at me in the auditorium when I read my essay.
No, my dear. You must be mistaken.
No, my dear. You must be mistaken.
Oh bullshit.
I find these initial meetings to be much easier without the concerned relatives in attendance.
Am I supposed to say 'thank you'?

So it seems. May we be serious for a moment?
So it seems. May we be serious for a moment?
Why, Doctor! We've only just met!
Oh! Are you really?
Among persons such as yourself, creative people under great stress, erratic behavior is not at all uncommon and certainly nothing to be ashamed of. It's just that the neuroses which fuel your talent can also generate certain character disabilities which...
Do you expect me, for one moment, to believe you have greater insight into my personality than I do?
Please sit down...
Please sit down...
You may discuss my predicament, Doctor. You may discuss it with anyone you like, but not with me. I'm not interested. I can solve my problems without recourse to a veternarian.

Besides, I don't want to be what you want to make me.

And what's that?

Normal. Average.

All right. Will you please sit down now? Symington says.

...Did you really say that?

Just a little joke, Miss Farmer.
Just a little joke, Miss Farmer.
This whole thing is a joke!
This whole thing is a joke!
Stay calm, please.
Stay calm, please.
No, you stay calm, Doctor! But you're finding that difficult, aren't you? Why, are you attracted to me? Perhaps later, in some of our more intimate sessions... after we know each other a little better... and you've torn my personality to shreds, and I'm weeping and vulnerable... then you'll really get your kicks, won't you, "Doctor?"

I'll have someone show you to your room.
I'll have someone show you to your room.
Oh, that's good, very professional. In control. But the tiny beads of sweat on your upper lip give you away.
Is there something else?
You didn't say 'Symington says'.
...I'm sorry to keep you waiting, the staff review ran over. Did you enjoy your mother's visit?
Yes. It was very good to see her.
Yes. It was very good to see her.
Really? Any problems?
Not at all. She brought me my fan mail. I had no idea there were so many strangers concerned about me. But I guess that's the best thing about working in the movies. You make so many friends. I want to go back and show them that the faith they put in me wasn't a mistake.
You're telling me you feel guilty.
You're telling me you feel guilty.
No... What I mean is... I'm just very excited by the prospect of getting on with my life, that's all.
No... What I mean is... I'm just very excited by the prospect of getting on with my life, that's all.
Do you really believe your mother's trying to kill you?

What?

She told me you said, "Mama, you want to kill me."

I never said... Oh look. That's just a figure of speech. She said something funny, and I said...
I never said... Oh look. That's just a figure of speech. She said something funny, and I said...
And you accused her of tampering with your mail.
And you accused her of tampering with your mail.
Oh for Christ's...
I'm sorry. She misunderstood, that's all.
But you tell me you had a pleasant visit and your mother says you were sullen and uncommunicative. Whom do you think I should believe?

Frances, you're still filled with anxiety. You feel guilty and hostile toward your family and friends. Consequently, I didn't recommend your release at the staff review.

You what?
You what?
Mental illness is an elusive thing, and though I'm pleased you're feeling more... capable, it's perhaps unrealistic to expect you to be completely cured after so short a time. Don't you agree?
I'm sure you'll see it my way in the end.
Dr. Symington, how big is your dick?
Dr. Symington, how big is your dick?
Huh?
Huh?
'Cause if it's long enough, which I doubt, why don't you wrap it around and fuck yourself in the ass!
I want outta here, you understand? I'm ready to get out! So you go back there... you go back and you tell them to let me out!
Frances, I'm warning you...
Frances, I'm warning you...
No, I'm warning you! Who do you think you are, God? You bumble around with your folders... ...and your pencils... ...and your god-damn buttons... ...all your badges of authority! But you have no authority! You're nothing! You're a zero!
Symington says...
Sedate her.
And do you think it's radical for a man to have a job and feed a family?
No!
No!
Is it radical for you to have a hand in shaping your future, and the future of your children?

No! No!
No! No!
Good! Because, Brothers, that's you!
I don't know why they even bother. She's had enough of this to knock sense into a bull elephant.
Yeah?
Yeah?
I checked the files. This one holds the record for shock treatments. Four hundred seventeen and no end in sight.

You're kidding.

Yeah, well, you know doctors. They sure hate to use that word.
Yeah, well, you know doctors. They sure hate to use that word.
What?
What?
'Incurable.'
You were with him at the end.
Yes.
Yes.
I was watching.
I longed to be with him. But I wanted his final moments to have peace. I could see you were a friend to him.
What is that to you? Evil as you are.
What is that to you? Evil as you are.
I am as he made me. In his own image.
I am as he made me. In his own image.
You drove him to his torment.
You drove him to his torment.
And he drove me to mine.
And he drove me to mine.
Then why weep for him?
Then why weep for him?
Would you not? He was father. And mother. We fell from grace together. He from his God. I from mine.
I've never been shown a kindness. Show me one now.
What kindness?
What kindness?
Build for him a pyre. Light up the sky with his passing.
Nice.
The music? Or the fire?
I'm glad you finally came to the door. A man shouldn't have to scurry in the shadows.
Better that way... for me.
Better that way... for me.
Why?
Why?
I'm... very, very ugly. People are afraid. Except you.
I'm... very, very ugly. People are afraid. Except you.
It can't be as bad as that.

You're an outcast.
Yes. I have been seeking my friends.

Friends? Do they live around here?

Yes. Very close
Yes. Very close
Why do you not go to them?
I have been... afraid. Afraid... they will hate me... because I am so very ugly... and they are so very beautiful
People can be kinder than you think.
People can be kinder than you think.
I am afraid.
Come warm yourself if you like.
You speak.

Yes, I speak. And read. And think... and know the ways of Man. I've been waiting for you. Two months now.
Yes, I speak. And read. And think... and know the ways of Man. I've been waiting for you. Two months now.
How did you find me?
The letters in your journal. That and a geography book. Your Elizabeth sounds lovely.
Kill me and have done with it.
Kill me and have done with it.
Kill you? Hardly that.
Kill you? Hardly that.
Then why am I here? What did you want with me?
Then why am I here? What did you want with me?
More to the point, why am I here? What did you want with me? What does one say to one's Maker, having finally met him face to face? Milton gave it voice. Did I request thee, Maker, from my clay to mould me Man? Did I solicit thee from Darkness to promote me?

How dare you. You're disgusting and evil.
How dare you. You're disgusting and evil.
Evil? Do you believe in evil?
Evil? Do you believe in evil?
I see it before me.
I see it before me.
I'm not sure I believe. But then I had no one to instruct me. I had no mother... and my father abandoned me at birth.
Why, Victor? Why? What were you thinking?
There was something at work in my soul which I do not understand.
There was something at work in my soul which I do not understand.
What of my soul? Do I have one? Or was that a part you left out? Who were these people of which I am comprised? Good people? Bad people?

Materials. Nothing more.
Materials. Nothing more.
You're wrong. Do you know I knew how to play this?
In which part of me did this knowledge reside? In these hands? In this mind? In this heart? And reading and speaking. Not things learned... so much as things remembered.
Trace memories in the brain, perhaps.
Trace memories in the brain, perhaps.
Stolen memories. Stolen and hazy. They taunt me in my dreams. I've seen a beautiful woman lying back and beckoning for me to love her. Whose woman was this? I've seen boys playing, splashing about in a stream. Whose childhood friends were these? Who am I?

I do know that for the sympathy of one living being, I would make peace with all. I have love in me the likes of which you can scarcely imagine. And rage the likes of which you would not believe. If I cannot satisfy the one, I will demonically indulge the other. That choice is yours. You're the one who set this in motion,

And if I consent?
And if I consent?
We'd travel north, my bride and I. To the furthest reaches of the Pole, where no man has ever set foot. There we would live out our lives. Together. No human eye would ever see us again. This I vow.
Soon?
Yes. I want this over and done with.
Yes. I want this over and done with.
I'll be waiting. And watching.
Why... her?
Her body pleases me.
What is this?
A brain. Extremities.

What does it matter? She'll live again. You'll make her.

No. I draw the line.
You will honor your promise to me!
I will not! Kill me now!
I will not! Kill me now!
That is mild compared to what will come. If you deny me my wedding night. I'll be with you on yours.
She's beautiful.
She's not for you.
She's not for you.
I'm sure the lady knows her own mind. Doesn't she? Let her decide the proper suitor.
GET AWAY FROM HER! SHE'S MINE!
SHE'LL NEVER BE YOURS! SHE SAID MY NAME! SHE REMEMBERS!
Poor William! What indignant tears!
There, there... shhh...
That's the nature of all progress, William. Don't let your brother sway you otherwise.
Quite right!
Elizabeth, really! He's quite mad!
Scandalous! What would your dear mother say?
Scandalous! What would your dear mother say?
One-two-three, one-two-three, twirl- two-three...
You dance so beautifully together.
And you look so lovely.
Must've been a terrible row.
He was almost expelled for calling one of his professors a "pompous... Fellow..."
Nothing. Still nothing.
It's been months. It's not like him.

And not a word of them to Father. He's agitated enough not hearing from Victor.
And not a word of them to Father. He's agitated enough not hearing from Victor.
Read him one of the old letters and rephrase it. We'll say it came today. It'll set his mind at ease.
Are you all right?
Fine.
He always was opinionated.
He set things right with a proper apology... and now they've put him in charge of dissection lab!
What does it say?
Let this locket be a token of the vow we took the night I left. He's coming home to marry me.
Have you seen Willie?
Is he not back yet?
Is he not back yet?
Claude rode over there to see if held lost track of time. They say he never arrived.
Claude rode over there to see if held lost track of time. They say he never arrived.
It's far too late for him to still be out.
Don't cry, Elizabeth.
Aren't you?
Are you sure it can't hurt us?
Nothing can. Not ever.
How could all my father's knowledge and skill fail to save her?
It's not ours to decide. All that live must die. It's God's will.
What kind of God is He to will this?
She was mother to me as well. But ours is the job of the living. It's up to us now to hold this family together. We must think of Father and be strong for him. I cannot do that alone.

God took her from us.

He left a beautiful gift in her place. A baby boy. To cherish and love as our very own. Your brother
Victor, have a care! You'll make him dizzy!
The world is a dizzying place.
Oh, do give him here! He needs to be comforted and held!
He needs to vent his outrage to the skies! Make yourself heard, Willie! Learning to walk is not an easy thing! Why should it be so?
Don't listen, Willie. Progress is a feast to be consumed. Women would have you believe you must walk before you can run. Or run before you can waltz!
Give me that child before you fill his head with drivel!
Smell the air. Wonderful.
Quite a send-off, isn't it?
Quite a send-off, isn't it?
Father's so proud.
Father's so proud.
And you?
And you?
Prouder still. You'll be the handsomest student there.
Prouder still. You'll be the handsomest student there.
I'll have to do better than that.
I'll have to do better than that.
You will. What do you want, Victor?
You will. What do you want, Victor?
To be the best there ever was. To push our knowledge beyond our dreams... to eradicate disease and pestilence... to purge mankind of ignorance and fear...
I've loved you all my life
All my life I've known.
This feels... incestuous.
Is that what makes it so delicious?
Brother and sister still?
I wish to be your husband.
I wish to be your husband.
I wish to be your wife.
I wish to be your wife.
Then come with me to Ingolstadt. Marry me now.
Then come with me to Ingolstadt. Marry me now.
If only I could. But one of us must stay. Father's not strong. Willie's just a child. Who can look after them in your absence? Who can run the estate?
If only I could. But one of us must stay. Father's not strong. Willie's just a child. Who can look after them in your absence? Who can run the estate?
Only you.

I will be here when you return.
You make me weak.
Not as weak as I.
Our decision. Together.
Your decision. For us.
Your decision. For us.
I give you my soul...

My mind was not playing tricks. He was there in the storm... gloating over his crimes... challenging me to come.

They've done a fine job. Hanging an innocent for the crime of a fiend.
Do you know this man? Is there something between you?
I know only that he is a killer. And I shall bring back his carcass.
I thought I'd never see you again!
I'm all right. I'm safe,
What sort of task?
It's not something I can explain now. Perhaps someday.

A month at most, that's all I ask. Elizabeth, please. Things have not yet resolved. I must take steps to see that they do. For our family's sake. For our sake. You are life itself. We shall seal our vow. The moment I am done.
No. Not tomorrow, not next week, Marry me today.
Why the change? What about your work?

Victor, tell me why! Trust me!
Victor, tell me why! Trust me!
I do. But you must trust me for now.
Brother and sister no more.
Now husband and wife.
I remember the first time I ever saw you. Crossing the floor of the grand ballroom with my parents at your side. So beautiful even then.
I have been waiting for this ever since.
Victor!
Open this door for no-one!
It's going to ram us.
It wouldn't dare.
Captain, I implore you. The men are frightened and angry. They want your assurance.
They knew the risks when they signed on. I've come too far to turn back now.

Aye, Captain.
I'm quite serious. Look at all the charity and clinic work we do. Up until thirty years ago, the concept of vaccine was unheard of.
You're saying all disease will eventually be eradicated?

Thank goodness. We'd be out of work.
Professor?
Oh God.
I was just clearing my throat.
Very well then.
I am not mad.
As a march hare.
Are you having me on?
Of course I am. It pays to humor the insane.
Henry Clerval.
Victor, Victor Frankenstein.
Victor, Victor Frankenstein.
I know. You have a way of making an impression.
Do you really think I'm mad?
Come now. Magnus? Agrippa? Next thing you know, you'll be teaching toadstools to speak.
Rich old ladies and their daughters?
Can you think of a better reason?
Can you think of a better reason?
Quite a few.
Quite a few.
Do me a favor then... ...keep them to yourself.
The entire school heard it. It wasn't something one could miss.
You're a comfort to me, Henry.
You're a comfort to me, Henry.
What now? Writing about it in your journal won't help.

It's a letter to my father.
Now you've got him started.
These are exciting times, Henry. We're entering an era of amazing breakthroughs. Look at Edward Jenner. He wasn't content to bleed people with leeches, he pioneered a new frontier of thought

...yes, and thanks to him, smallpox has been virtually eliminated. I've heard this speech before.
But you haven't listened, Never in history has so much seemed possible. We're on the verge of answers undreamt of... but only if we have the courage to ask the questions.
Only you would think of that!
Somebody has to!
And here's to Him. Everything in moderation, Frankenstein.
Nothing in moderation, Clerval.
They just caught the man who did it.
He was a frightened soul who acted out of fear and ignorance.

They'll hang him all the same.

Good. I'll be there to hear his worthless neck snap.
Keep your voice down. You don't know what you're saying.
It was wrong, Henry! It shouldn't have happened! The bastard deserves to die.
You're making a scene!
Why Waldman? He of all people should have cheated death!

You can't. Death is God's will!

There are sick people who need our help. Here and now. Not in some future time. Consider that.
Victor. This has got to stop. Nobody's seen you in months. You haven't attended a single class.
I've been preoccupied.
I've been preoccupied.
We all know how hard you took Waldman's death. Even Krempe is sympathetic. But it is time to move on. It is time to concern yourself with life.

How much longer?
How much longer?
Few months perhaps. I'm gathering the raw materials even now.
This is a bad time, Henry. I'm busy just now. What do you want?
Things have gone worse with this cholera outbreak. Thousand new cases a day now. Classes have been suspended. University's shut down.

You'll be leaving then. Just as well. You never were cut out for this, Henry. Goodbye.
Thank God your fever broke. Slowly, now. Just a sip. I've been worried we might lose you. It's been touch-and-go for a week.
A... week?
A... week?
We feared cholera. Turned out to be pneumonia, brought on by nervous exhaustion and some idiot running around in a storm.

Mine and Professor Krempe's. We've been trading off nursing you in shifts. The rest of the time we're out working with the cholera victims. It's his turn for that just now.

It's the down-and-outs I pity most. Those who can't fend for themselves. They'll be dead by the thousands before this is done. They don't stand a chance out there.
No. They don't.
No. They don't.
Victor. This place looked like a charnel house. What went on here?
Quite a place.
Thank you, Henry.
Thank you, Henry.
For what?
For what?
This. My home. My family. If not for you, I'd be dead in a burial pit somewhere.
What happened up there?
I didn't find what I was looking for.
Are you sure you'll be all right?
Yes, don't worry. I'll look after your father. You look after her.
Yes, don't worry. I'll look after your father. You look after her.
I'll be back as soon as I've got her far away and safe. We'll hunt this fiend down together.

I owe you that. Done.
All that I once loved lies in a shallow grave. By my hand.
Let it go.
Yes. I took refuge in the barn. Wouldn't you? Lost in the storm? Freezing and wet? I was exhausted and could search no longer.
And is it true, Miss Moritz, that you love Victor Frankenstein? That your heart was broken? Answer the question. Do you love Victor Frankenstein?
I have always loved him.
Is it also not true that you murdered his brother William in a misdirected crime of passion?

So you have claimed. Yet you have no explanation for this. The locket last seen in the hands of the poor murdered child was found hidden in your dress the morning following the murder. The locket you so coveted. How did it come to be in your possession?

In science, the letter of fact is the letter of law. Our pursuit is as dogmatic as any religious precept. Think of yourselves as disciples of a strict and hallowed sect. Someday you may be priests... but only if you learn the scripture chapter and verse. Any questions?
But surely, Professor, you don't intend we disregard the more... philosophical works.

To say the least. I came here to expand my mind, but honest inquiry seems strangled at every turn. All we do is cling to the old knowledge instead of seeking the new.

No, I embrace it... as something to be used or discarded as we advance the boundaries of what is known.
Preposterous.
I once saw it done, as a boy in Canton. My parents were missionaries. The cure was nothing short of miraculous. I've never forgotten it. Been fascinated ever since.
Electricity.

Nonsense. Tonight you will draft an apology to Professor Krempe...
"...a sincere and heartfelt apology which you will then read aloud to him before the assembled student body and faculty.
Why?
Why?
Our profession needs talent like yours. Destroy your career over an issue of pride? What a waste.
Re-configure the leads?
Numbers four and twelve directly into the nervous system?
Victor. He was trying to be gracious.
The strain was evident.
I tell you what we need, my friends. Forget the symptoms and diseases. What we need is a vaccine for death itself.
Oh, now you have gone too far. There's only one God, Victor.
You're awake. I've prepared some broth. It'll help restore you.
I'm... dying.
Frostbite. Gangrene. A simple diagnosis.

Lives are ephemeral. The knowledge we gain, the achievements we leave behind... those live on.
Do you share my madness?
Madness?
We are kindred, you and I. Men of ambition. Let me tell you all that I have lost in such pursuits. I pray my story will come to mean for you all that is capricious and evil in man.
Who are you?
Who are you?
My name is Frankenstein...
He's dead... She's dead... all dead... Please save me... oh... poor Bill... Oh my God, oh my God... oh God...
It will be all right. I'll take care of you.
It will be all right. I'll take care of you.
Jack? Marcie? Ned?
It's just this place. The storm. That's why you're all upset.
No, no, they're all dead...
So young, so pretty. What monster could have done such a thing?
Bill -- Bill -- Bill is out there...
The killer is still out there.
I will protect you.
We should go now.
Maybe we should wait for Mr. Christy.
What'd you see?
I don't know. Marcie's got me paranoid.
Shows how much you know. It's something about tomorrow.
Tomorrow is another day.
Tomorrow is another day.
Right! Right!
Melvin Belli.
I was careless.
I think we should go wake them up. Just in case.
Give them a little while longer. It's still early, anyway.

Good night, Alice.
Good night, Brenda.
Cabin B is ready.
Push on this side. Alice, this is Jack, Marcie and Ned. Push.
That's got her. Thanks. I'm Steve Christy. Welcome to Camp Crystal Lake. You got some grubby clothes? Climb into 'em. Alice, see if Bill has cleaned out the boathouse. I want him to start with the canoes. What happened to Brenda?
You told her to sweep the courts.
You draw very well.
Oh, thanks. I wish I could spend more time at it.
Any particular reason?
Just a feeling. Nothing personal.
Just a feeling. Nothing personal.
You want to leave?

I don't know. Probably be best for everybody.
I don't know. Probably be best for everybody.
You may not care a lot about this place, Alice, but I mean to make it my whole life. It's been my whole life. Gimme a chance. Stay a week. Help get it ready. Next Friday, if you're not happy, I'll put you on the bus myself. I'll be grateful.
Next Friday.
Thanks, Alice.
I've got to go to town and pick up the trailer and all that other stuff, but I'll be back around ten. If you're still up, we can talk, okay?
Sure.
Steve said for you to start on the boats.
I finished the boats.
Alice? The others show up?
Everybody except the girl who's supposed to handle the kitchen. Annie.
You think you're gonna last all summer?
I'm not sure I'll last all week. I'll tell Steve.
Steve said you were thinking of leaving. True?
Un-hunh.
Oh, my God...
You okay?
How come you're leaving?
It's long and personal. It has nothing to do with you or the other kids.
It's long and personal. It has nothing to do with you or the other kids.
Maybe I can help?
And it's this place. It makes no sense, but it spooks me.
You're right. It makes no sense.
Filmmaker.
Artist.
It still hurts?
I walked into it knowing I'd get hurt, but I thought I could stand anything. I just wasn't ready for that kind of pain. We were supposed to meet in L.A. When I got back there, he sent a telegram saying he was going back to his wife.
What'll you do when you leave here?
I don't know.
I didn't know I was asleep... What time is it?
Almost five.
You can only do what you can do.
And then Steve looks at you with those hurt eyes -- like you don't care about children...
How the... did he get in there?
Slipped in. Probably liked the scent of your perfume.
Trouble?
Bad bulb or no power. It's getting a little gloomy in here.
Jack and Marcie are gonna be drenched.
Not if they're where I think they are.
It wouldn't matter except Steve should be getting back pretty soon. It wouldn't look so great if he fell over them.
Good point.
Good point.
Well, it hasn't been that long.
Help you clean up?
Absolutely.
I don't hear it anymore.
Can't hear anything through that wind and rain.
Can't hear anything through that wind and rain.
It sounded like Brenda.

I'll go take a look.
I'll go take a look.
Did somebody leave the lights on at the softball field?
Where?
They're off now.
I'll go check on Brenda.
Okay.
Jack?
Marcie?
Marcie?
Hey, guys!
It's dead. Try the pay phone.
Do you have a dime? A quarter?
Do you have a dime? A quarter?
No. There must be some in the desk somewhere.
What's the matter with it?
Wet. I don't know.
Why don't we run? Just run now?
It's over twenty miles to the crossroads. Steve'll be back in an hour. Things will straighten out then. We'll take his Jeep and get help.
How come?
Some campers drowned. Then some counselors got killed.
I'll be along.
Don't burn that gorgeous body, or I'll scratch your eyes out...
I'm sorry.
Ned? We're gonna be working together for a while. You're a nice guy without all the entertainment, okay?
Sure.
I'm gonna go lie down and catch some z's. Today wiped me out. Thanks, Alice.
I'm gonna go lie down and catch some z's. Today wiped me out. Thanks, Alice.
You're welcome.
You said we were special.
I meant everything.
You know what I said, though.
I can't, Barry...
I wouldn't know.
Oh, you...
Claudette...
Somebody'll see.
Somebody'll see.
No, they won't...
Somebody's there, Barry.
Come on, Claudette. A man's not made of stone.
Come on, Claudette. A man's not made of stone.
Let's go back, Barry...
Let's go back, Barry...
I need you so much, Claudette.
What the hell?
Where'd you get that stuff?
Give me a hand?
For sure.
This is almost like the one at my uncle's cabin in Maine.
Here we go.
I'll be okay. Holy shit...
Don't get up. Take a second...
You saved my life.
I had to.
I had to.
Thanks.
Thanks.
I figured if I didn't save you. I'd have to give you mouth-to-mouth and that would have ruined my appetite.
Floor probably leaks. This area is full of springs.
A short somewhere.
What is it?
Is it stuck?
Roll him over!
Get behind him more.
Chance to get even?
I'll spot you five points.
You just had some lucky shots.
Where's Ned?
Did anyone ever tell you you're beautiful when you're angry?
I don't believe you...
I don't believe you...
Want to see my trick shot? It's even better.
You ever fire one of those bows again, and I'll tack you up on the wall to dry.
God, but I love that sexy talk.
What do you want to be when you grow up?
Dancer.
Holy shit...
We wouldn't want you thinking you're the only show-off in camp, would we?
No wonder they lost America. How could you sneak around in the bushes wearing that? What's to eat?
Whatever you make yourself.
What hath God wrought?
That was the telephone.
That was the telephone.
Ha! You wily oriental! The phone was "Mr. Watson, come in here, I need you." "What hath God wrought" was the telegraph.
Ha!
Sometimes I only think about kissing women.
Ow!
I was just wondering if you thought there'd by any other gorgeous women at Camp Crystal Lake. Besides yourself.
What about the dope paragraph in Mr. Christy's letter?
Quote: Controlled substances are expressly forbidden. Possession or use of marijuana or alcohol on campgrounds will means instant dismissal. Unquote.
Jack?
Coach, athletic director somewhere.
It's gonna be a long summer.
Wait, wait! When I was finding these goodies in the shed. I also found this letter which a camper never sent home. Listen.
Steve taught me how to use the emergency generator. The town power lines are supposed to be real shitty.
God, but I love that macho talk! Emergency generators! The Indian used campfires.
How about our last jay?
Good call.
Just a walk, for Chrissakes.
Boy, we sure do have a lot of filthy small-minded people around here. Wait a minute, I'll get my diaphragm and be right with you.
Wind's up. It's shifted a good hundred and eighty degrees.
Makes me want to hold on and never let go.
Makes me want to hold on and never let go.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
What about Neddy?
I don't love Neddy.
I don't love Neddy.
He keeps on acting like such an asshole!
He keeps on acting like such an asshole!
Ned!
Ned!
Don't call him.

I thought you wanted to give him one of your motherly lectures. Ned is gonna do whatever he wants to do, you know.

Looks like a storm.
I'm a little scared of storms. Always have been. Since I was a kid.

You? The brick?
It's just a dream.
I call it my shower dream.
This is no dream. Want to escape for a while?
Lead the way!
Are you wet?
Just a little. Wait a minute, woman.
Mmmmmmmph?
Mmmmmmmph.
Mmmmmmmph.
Best over...

Umhummmmph.
Umhummmmph.

Whassamatta?
Whassamatta?
Gotta pee. You're lying on my bladder.
Sex is all you ever think of, Neddy.
There you are dead wrong.
It's beautiful...
Yeah, and it also look like it hasn't seen a coat of paint in six years.
Cowboy.
Girls can't be cowboys.
Girls can't be cowboys.
Okay, Fireman.
Doctor. Now, if you were a flavor of ice cream, what would you be?
Rocky Road.
Last line of Gone With the Wind?
Frankly, Scarlet, I don't give a damn!
You okay?
Those things can be nasty.
Wait'll you're really in trouble and see what happens...
But it's in the brochure! "Camp Crystal Lake has a full drama program." You just saw it.
Anything else you want?
No, thanks. I'm fine. Sandy.
No, thanks. I'm fine. Sandy.
You can't go back there tonight. Not in that stuff. 'Less you wanta get drownded.

They'll be okay if they know enough to stay in outta the rain.

How much do I owe you?
How much do I owe you?
One night on the town.
One night on the town.
I mean...
I mean...
...I know what you mean. Two and a quarter. Plus fifteen percent tip to make up for me spending the night alone.
Yeah. I got it on before this -- -- all started.
That's thirty percent.
That's thirty percent.
For two lonely nights.
I told you not to buy that hunk of junk!
I think water got into the electrical system. You ride me back to camp? I'll get one of my counselors to drive me back tomorrow morning.

Why not?
Bad enough we got a full moon; it's Friday the 13th. They keep statistics. We get more accidents, more robberies, more rapes, more homicides, more of everything when there's a full moon. It affects people. Makes 'em nuts.
You've made a science out of coincidence.
Have to drop you here, Steve.
Sure.
Good luck.
Another coincidence.
Another coincidence.
Yeah.
How many with you?
Just my son and I.
Just my son and I.
What is your purpose in Mexico?
What is your purpose in Mexico?
Vacation. I'm taking him to see his first bullfight.
What was that?
Oh, that's just my daughter in the bathroom.

I meant me, my son and my daughter.

Open the door. I'm coming aboard.
Whatsamatter with you? Are you crazy?
Why the fuck, outta all the god forsaken shit holes in Mexico, did you have us rendezvous at that place?

I don't know, one place's as good as another.
I don't know, one place's as good as another.
Have you ever been there before?
Have you ever been there before?
No, but I passed by it a couple of times. It's out in the middle of nowhere. It seems like a rowdy place, so there wouldn't be a lot of police. And it's open from dusk till dawn. You said meet you in the morning.

Well, because you picked that place out of a hat, my brother's dead now. And this girl's family's dead.
I'm sorry to hear that. What were they, psychos?
Did they look like psychos? They were fuckin' vampires. Psychos don't explode when sunlight hits 'em, I don't care how crazy they are.
Oh, Seth, how can I ever make it up to you?
You can't, but fifteen percent instead of thirty for my stay at El Ray is a good start.
You can't, but fifteen percent instead of thirty for my stay at El Ray is a good start.
Twenty-eight.
Twenty-eight.
Jesus Christ, Carlos, my brother's dead and he's not coming back, and it's all your fault. Twenty.
You like the car?
I said new, this is an '90.
I said new, this is an '90.
It's hardly been used at all. I got it from a drug dealer who only drove it 5 times in as many years. Swear to God. That's like new.

So do I just follow you?

Yeah, follow us.
Yeah, follow us.
So let's do it.
So let's do it.
Vamanos!
We got about two more hours of day light left. That'll get us into El Paso, which is right next to the border. We'll stop at a motel --
Stop? We're not going to actually stop at a motel, are we?
Unless you two wiseacres wanna be introduced to the joys of hitchhiking, what say we drop this?
The truth hurts.
Why do you want to stop?
I'm exhausted.
I'm exhausted.
Lie in the back, Dad, I'll drive us into Mexico.
What's this guy's problem?
I have no idea.
What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna try and get us across the border.
I'm gonna try and get us across the border.
No, dad, you gotta tell 'em that they're back there.
Have you forgotten about your sister?
They're gonna kill us. They get us across the border, they're gonna take us out in the desert and shoot us.
They're gonna kill us. They get us across the border, they're gonna take us out in the desert and shoot us.
If they get over the border, they're gonna let us go.
If they get over the border, they're gonna let us go.
Dad, I watch those reality shows. They never let anybody go. Any cop will tell you, in a situation like this, you get a chance, you go for it. This is our chance.

They're gonna kill her anyway. At least now with all these cops we've got a fighting chance.

Son, I have this situation under control. I know exactly what I'm doing. You're going to have to trust me on this.
Son, I have this situation under control. I know exactly what I'm doing. You're going to have to trust me on this.
If trusting you means trusting those fuckin' killers, I can't do that. If you don't tell the cops, I will.
Now, you listen to me. You ain't gonna do a goddamn fucking thing, you hear me! Nobody cares what you think, I'm running this show, I make the decisions.
He's running the show.
He's running the show.
I'm running the show. I make the plays, and you back the plays I make. Stop thinking with your fucking balls. Kate in a room with a couple of desperate men with nothing to fucking lose ain't the time to "go for it." I need your cover. Cover my ass.
You don't believe in suicide.
It's not suicide if you're already dead. Two...
It's not suicide if you're already dead. Two...
Okay, I'll kill you when you change, I swear to God in Jesus Christ's name.
Okay, I'll kill you when you change, I swear to God in Jesus Christ's name.
Thank you, son.
Why did they block the door again?
To keep the daylight out! This is where they sleep! Get to the door!
What's your name?
Jacob.
Jacob.
Okay, Jacob, get up and sit your ass down on the bed. Make a wrong move and I'll shoot you in the face.
What's the story with you two? You a couple of fags?
He's my son.
He's my son.
How does that happen? You don't look Japanese.

Neither does he. He looks Vietnamese.

Oh, well, excuse me all to hell.

What's this about, money?
What's this about, money?
It's about money, all right, but not yours. You see, me and my brother here are in a little hot water and we need your assistance.
It's okay, honey. Everything's going to be all right.
Just listen to daddy, sugar, and don't do nothin' stupid. You two, Simon says sit the fuck down!
Where are the keys to the motor home?
On the dresser.
On the dresser.
Richie, take the keys. Start that big bastard up, and drive it up front.
Not a chance.

Good. Your old man's all right, he just saved your life.

No. It was a rainy night, the brakes on the car weren't great. She had to stop suddenly. She slid on the road, she crashed, she died.

Whewww! Those acts of God really stick it in and break it off, don't they?
Yes, they do.
Is this real?
Yes.
Yes.
I've seen one of these before. A friend of mine had himself declared a minister of his own religion. Away to fuck the IRS. Is that what you're doing, or are you the real McCoy?

Yes.
Yes.
Why'd ya quit?
Why'd ya quit?
I think I've gotten about as up close and personal with you as I'm gonna get. Now if you need me like I think you need me, you're not gonna kill me 'cause I won't answer your stupid, prying questions. So, with all due respect, mind your own business.

I seem to have touched a nerve. Don't be so sensitive, Pops, let's keep this friendly. But you're right, enough with the getting to know you shit. Now, there's two ways we can play this hand. One way is me and you go round an' round all fuckin' night. The other way, is we reach some sort of an understanding. Now, if we go

Yes.
Yes.
I thought so. You help us get across the border without incident, stay with us the rest of the night without trying anything funny, and in the morning we'll let you and your family go. That way everybody gets what they want. You and your kids get out of this alive and we get into Mexico. Everybody's happy.

How do I know you'll keep your word?
Jesus Christ, Pops, don't start with this shit.
Jesus Christ, Pops, don't start with this shit.
You want me to sit here and be passive. The only way being passive in this situation makes sense is if I believe you'll let us go. I'm not there yet. You have to convince me you're telling the truth.

Look, dickhead, the only thing you need to be convinced about is that you're stuck in a situation with a coupla real mean motor scooters. I don't wanna hafta worry about you all fuckin' night. And I don't think you wanna be worrying about my brother's intentions toward your daughter all night. You notice the way he looked at her, didn't ya?

Didn't like it, did ya?
Didn't like it, did ya?
No, I didn't.
No, I didn't.
Didn't think so. So, as I was saying, I'm willing to make a deal. You behave, get us into Mexico, and don't try to escape. I'll keep my brother off your daughter and let you all loose in the morning.

You won't let him touch her?
You won't let him touch her?
I can handle Richie, don't worry.
If he touches her, I'll kill him. I don't give a fuck how many guns you have, nothing will stop me from killing him.
Fair enough. You break your word, I'll kill all of you. Kate, honey!
Swear to God, on the Bible, you won't try to escape and you'll get us across the border.
I swear to God I won't try to escape and I'll do my best to get you into Mexico.
I swear to God I won't try to escape and I'll do my best to get you into Mexico.
You best better get it done, Pops.
I'm telling you, don't hurt her.
As long as you're cool, she'll be cool. What're ya gonna say?
As long as you're cool, she'll be cool. What're ya gonna say?
I don't have the slightest idea.
I don't have the slightest idea.
Well, you just keep thinkin' of that gun next to Kate's temple.
We did our part, we gotcha in Mexico. Now it's time for your part, letting us go.
Pops, when you're right, you're right, and you are right.
Then?
Then stop, 'cause that's where we're going.
Out of the stew pot and into the fire.
Shit, I been to bars make this place look like a fuckin' 4-H club.
Who else?
Pass.
Pass.
Why not, against your religion?
Why not, against your religion?
No, I do drink, I'm just not drinking now.
No, I do drink, I'm just not drinking now.
Suit yourself, more for me. Scotty?
Why are you so agitated?
I'm still stewing about that ape laying hands on me. And that fuckin' bartender sticks a weed up my ass, too.

He backed down.

He's smilin' at us. But behind his smile, he's sayin', "Fuck you Jack." I hear that loud and clear.

What are you going to do?
What are you going to do?
I'm gonna just sit here and drain this bottle. And when I've drunk the last drop, if I still feel then, the way I feel now, I'm gonna take this bottle and break it over his melon head.

Are you so much a fucking loser, you can't tell when you've won?
What did you call me?
Nothing. I didn't make a statement. I asked a question. Would you like me to ask it again? Very well. Are you such a loser you can't tell when you've won? The entire state of Texas, along with the FBI, is looking for you. Did they find you? No. They couldn't. They had every entrance to the border covered. There's no way you could
To your family.
To yours.
Now, is your shit together?
Forever together.
Okay, does anybody here know what's going on?
Yeah, I know what's going on. We got a bunch of fuckin' vampires outside trying to get inside and suck our fuckin' blood! That's it, plain and simple. And I don't wanna hear any bullshit about "I don't believe in vampires" because I don't fuckin' believe in vampires either. But I do believe in my own two fuckin' eyes, and with my two eyes
You too, preacher?
I'm like you. I don't believe in vampires, but I believe in what I saw.
I'm like you. I don't believe in vampires, but I believe in what I saw.
Good for you. Now, since we all believe we're dealing with vampires, what do we know about vampires? Crosses hurt vampires. Do you have a cross?

In the Winnebago.
In the Winnebago.
In other words, no.
I don't know about that. In order for it to have any power, I think it's gotta be an official crucifix.
What's an official cross? Some piece of tin made in Taiwan? What makes that official? If a cross works against vampires, it's not the cross itself, it's what the cross represents. The cross is a symbol of holiness.

Okay, I'll buy that. So we got crosses covered, moving right along, what else?
Did he...?
Yep.
You all are gonna fuckin' die! I'm gonna fuckin' kill every last one of you godless pieces of shit!
You bet your sweet ass you are, and I'm gonna help you do it. But we ain't got much time.
What's this stuff?
My guess is that this little dive's been feeding on nomad road waifs like bikers and truckers for a longtime. This is probably some of the shipments they stole off the trucks.

Well, I say lets tear this place apart for weapons. So when they burst through that door, we'll make 'em wish they never did.

I don't give a shit about living or dying anymore. I just want to send as many of these devils back to hell as I can.

I promise.
Kate, Scott?
It's the bitterest of pills.
You two ought to start a stand-up act, because you're just wasting your humor on me.
You two ought to start a stand-up act, because you're just wasting your humor on me.
Ain't it the truth.
I just bet you would. Don't even think about it. Besides, I want to have one night's sleep in an honest- to-goodness bed. The beds in the home are okay, but they're not like a real bed.
Hey, if we go to a motel, we can swim.
Dad, when I called the machine to check our messages there was one from Bethel Baptist. Mr. Franklin said he wouldn't permanently replace you until we came back. He said when we come home, if you still feel the same way --
That's very nice of Ted, but I'll call him tomorrow and tell him not to bother waiting.
That's very nice of Ted, but I'll call him tomorrow and tell him not to bother waiting.
I didn't want to talk about this in front of Scott because he gets upset. But you don't believe in God anymore?

Not enough to be a pastor. Look, I know this is hard on you kids. After Jenny's death, this is probably the last thing you need. But I can't do it any longer. My congregation needs spiritual leadership. Well, they can't get that from me anymore. My faith is gone. To answer your question, yes, I do believe in Jesus. But do I love

It's just, all our lives you've been a pastor. For twenty years you've preached trust in the lord. And then one day you wake up and say fuck him?

That happens, you'll get it back.
That happens, you'll get it back.
Kate, give your old man a little credit. Every person who chooses the service of God as their life's work has something in common. I don't care if you're a preacher, a priest, a nun, a rabbi or a Buddhist monk. Many, many times during your life you'll look at your reflection in the mirror and ask yourself, am I a fool? We've all

What do you think Mom would say?
Mom's got nothing to say, she's dead.
There's nothing wrong with this place.
It's a flop house.
It's a flop house.
It's not a flop house. It's basic and simple. That doesn't make it a flop house.

If it doesn't have a pool, we're looking for a new place.
It has a bed. That's all I care about.
Other places have beds, they also have cable TV, a gym, room service...
About two hours from now.
So all we have to do is get by for a few more hours and then we can walk right out the front door.
You're gonna be okay, aren't you, daddy?
No, I'm not. I've been bit. In effect, I'm already dead.
I promise.
Scott?
Kate, we don't have all day, so I'm only gonna count to five. One...two... three... four...
Okay, okay, I promise I'll do it!
Okay, okay, I promise I'll do it!
Not good enough, swear to God.

I swear to God, our father, that when you change into one of the undead, I will kill you.

Good girl. Now, Scott, we have even less time, so I'm only giving you the count of three. One...
I'm going for 'em!
No!
No!
Everybody goes home!
What's going on?
We're having a wet bikini contest, and you just won.
Richie, will you do me a favor and eat my pussy?
Sure.
What?
Where are you taking us?
Where are you taking us?
Mexico.
Mexico.
What's in Mexico?

You asked me if I would --
Creepy guy.
The Sword of Damocles is lifted from above Seth's head. He's just solved a problem that a mere thirty seconds ago seemed unsolvable. He knows exactly how he's going to cross the border. Whistling a happy tune, he turns and walks back into room #9.
You got three minutes. One second longer, I shoot your father in the face. Do you understand what I just said?
Yes.
Yes.
Do you believe me?
Do you believe me?
Yes.
Yes.
You damn well better. Go.
Yeah.
You must have a bible in here, don't cha?
You must have a bible in here, don't cha?
Yeah, we got a bible.
Yeah, we got a bible.
Get it and bring it up here, will ya, please?
You're gonna let us go?
In the morning, darlin', in the morning, we are G-O-N-E and you are F-R-E-E. Now, I know I put you guys through hell, and I know I've been one rough pecker, but from here on end you guys are in my cool book. Scotty, help me pick Richie up, and lay him down. Jacob, keep going on this road till you get to a
How about you, cutie pie? Ready for round two?
Okay.
Are you okay?
Peachy! Why shouldn't I be? The world's my oyster, except for the fact that I just rammed a wooden stake in my brother's heart because he turned into a vampire, even though I don't believe in vampires. Aside from that unfortunate business, everything's hunky-dory.

I'm really sorry.
I'm really sorry.
Bullshit! You hate us. If you had half a chance you'd feed us to them!
We have to go back for Daddy!
Daddy's dead.
Daddy's dead.
Noooo!
Watch my back!
Anytime.
How many bullets left, kid?
Not many.
Not many.
Well, when you run out of weapons, just start cold cocking 'em. Make 'em sing for their supper.
Should I use the last bullets on us?
You use 'em on the first couple of these parasites that try to bite you.
I'm sorry.
Me too.
See ya.
Later.
Why, just look at all this. You got your kitchen --

For the time being we are very confident we will apprehend the fugitives in the next forty-eight hours. The Bureau, local law enforcement and the Texas Rangers have all joined forces in forming a dragnet to snare Seth and Richard Gecko.
Agent Chase, does it appear that they are heading for Mexico.

What about the report from an eyewitness at the liquor store who said one of the brothers was shot?
This can't be confirmed at this time, but we do believe it to be true. We have reason to believe it was the youngest brother Richard, and he was shot in the vicinity of his neck and shoulders by the store's clerk.

Is it safe to assume that because the death count involved and the loss of life of law enforcement officers, that the Bureau, the Rangers and the police force are taking this manhunt personally?

I'm by myself today, ate my lunch outta the microwave.

Whatsamatter?
Whatsamatter?
Awww, it's just been a shitass day. Every inch of it hot and miserable. First off, Nadine at the Blue Chip got some sorta sick, so that Mongoloid boy of hers was workin' the grill. That fuckin' idiot don't know rat shit from Rice Krispies. I ate breakfast at nine, was pukin' up pigs in a blanket like a sick dog by ten thirty.

You could sue the shit out of her, ya know. That kid belongs under a circus tent, not flippin' burgers. You could own that fuckin' place.

What the hell would I do with that grease pit? Besides, Nadine's got enough of a cross to bear just taking care of that potato head. Then all this Abilene shit happened. You heard about that bank robbery in Abilene, didn't ya?

That's all that's been on the box all day. They killed some people didn't they?
That's all that's been on the box all day. They killed some people didn't they?
Four Rangers, three cops, and two civilians. And they took a lady bank teller as a hostage.
They'll probably make a run for the border, which would bring 'em this way. And if we get our hands on those shit asses, we're talking payback time. We'll get 'em all right. I gotta piss. I'm gonna use your commode.
Knock yourself out.
Yeah, and I'm gonna be right back at it tomorrow. So tonight I'm gonna sit in front of the box and just drink booze. How much is the bottle?
Six-fifty.
What do you want from me? I did what you said.
Letting him use your toilet? No store does that.
Letting him use your toilet? No store does that.
He comes in here every day and we bullshit. He's used my toilet a thousand times. If I told him no, he'd know something was up.

I want that son-of-a-bitch out outta here, in his car, and down the road or you can change the name of this place to "Benny's World of Blood."
Were you giving that pig signals?
What? Are you kidding? I didn't do anything!
He says you were scratching.
I wasn't scratching!
I wasn't scratching!
You callin' him a liar?
I never said help us!
Well that don't matter now, 'cause you got about two fuckin' seconds to live! Richie!
Whiskey!
You can't come in here.
You can't come in here.
What dya mean?

This is a private club. You're not welcome.
This is a private club. You're not welcome.
Are you tellin' me I'm not good enough to drink here?
Are you tellin' me I'm not good enough to drink here?
This bar is for bikers and truckers only. You, get out!
Best in Mexico.
I kinda doubt that. We're grabbin' a table, send over a waitress to take our order.
What the fuck was that about?
He signaled the Ranger.
What the fuck is wrong with you --
Seth, he did it. You were by the beer cooler with your back turned. I was by the magazines, I could see his face. And I saw him mouth:
Start the car.
You believe me don't cha?
You believe me don't cha?
Shut up and start the car.
Richie? You okay?
I'm not dead, but I'm definitely shot! I told you that bastard said, "Help us!"
Yeah?
When I count three, shoot out the bottles behind him!
When I count three, shoot out the bottles behind him!
Gotcha!
Gotcha!
One... Two... Three.
What did I tell you? What did I tell you? Buy the road map and leave.
What am I supposed to do, Seth? He recognized us.
What am I supposed to do, Seth? He recognized us.
He didn't recognize shit.
Do they have cable?
No.
No.
Do they have an X-rated channel?
Do they have an X-rated channel?
No.
No.
Do they have a waterbed?
Do they have a waterbed?
They don't have anything except four walls and a roof, and that's all we need.
How's it feel?
How ya think, it hurts like a son-of- a-bitch.
I got both rooms on either side of us, so we don't gotta worry about eavesdropping assholes. How's that feel? You okay?
Feels good.
Feels good.
I'm gonna go get the money.
Hey, when you talk to him, see if you can arrange a better deal than thirty percent.
That's their standard deal, brother. They ain't about to change it for us.
That's their standard deal, brother. They ain't about to change it for us.
Did you even to try to negotiate?
Did you even to try to negotiate?
These guys ain't spic firecracker salesman from Tijuana. They don't even know the meaning of the word "barter". You wanna stay in El Ray? You give them thirty percent of your loot. It's scripture. So it is written, so shall it be done. You want sanctuary, you pay the price, and the price is thirty percent.

Shit, I started to get worried. Where the fuck ya been?
Sight seein'.
Sight seein'.
What'd ya see?
What'd ya see?
Cops.
Cops.
Didya look at the border?
Yeah, I saw the border. Through binoculars from on top of a high building. That's about as close as I risked getting. What's the TV say?
They're going to apprehend us in forty-eight hours.
I gotta figure a way to get across that goddamn border. Longer we fuck around El Paso our lives ain't worth a shit.
Look, fuck the border. Let's just dig in and wait for things to cool down.
Look, fuck the border. Let's just dig in and wait for things to cool down.
Richie, it's gonna get a lot fuckin' worse before it gets any fuckin' better. We showed our ass in Texas. We killed Texas fuckin' Rangers. They ain't gonna stop lookin' till they find us, and when they find us, they're gonna kill us. Texans take it very personal when ya kill their law enforcement officers. The El Paso police have already started a motel

How do you know?
How do you know?
I heard it on the radio. We gotta get our asses into Mexico tonight. Carlos is gonna meet us tomorrow morning at a rendezvous on the other side, then Carlos and his boys will escort us to El Ray and --
Where's the woman?
What?
What'd ya mean, what? The fuckin' woman, the hostage. Where the fuck is she, Richard!?
She's in the other room.
She's in the other room.
What the fuck is she doin' there?!
Yeah, explain it to me. I need an explanation. What's the matter with you?
There's nothing wrong with me, brother. That woman tried to escape and I did what I had to do.
There's nothing wrong with me, brother. That woman tried to escape and I did what I had to do.
No. That woman wouldn't of said shit if she had a mouthful.

Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong! Once you left, she became a whole different person.
Is it me? Is it my fault?
Is it me? Is it my fault?
It's not your fault, it's her fault!
Is this my fault? Do you think this is what I am?
What?
What?
This is not me! I am a professional fucking thief. I steal money. You try to stop me, god help you. But I don't kill people I don't have to, and I don't rape women. What you doin' ain't how it's done. Do you understand?

They're gonna search the van.
As long as you don't act like a fuckin' nut, we'll be just fine.

What does that mean?

What?
You just called me a fuckin' nut.
No, I didn't.
No, I didn't.
Yes, you did. You said as long as I don't act like a fuckin' nut, implying that I've been acting like a fuckin' nut.
Yes, you did. You said as long as I don't act like a fuckin' nut, implying that I've been acting like a fuckin' nut.
Take a pill, kid. I just meant stay cool.
Take a pill, kid. I just meant stay cool.
You meant that, but you meant the other, too.
This ain't the time, Richard.
Fuck those spic pigs! You called me a fuckin' nut, and where I come from, that stops the train on its tracks.
Fuck those spic pigs! You called me a fuckin' nut, and where I come from, that stops the train on its tracks.
Keep your voice down.
Keep your voice down.
Or what?
I'm curious. What was the nuttiest thing I did?
This ain't the time.
This ain't the time.
Oh, I know, was it possibly when your ass was rotting in jail and I broke it out? Yeah, you're right, that was pretty fuckin' nutty. Not to mention stupid. But you know what? I can fix that right now.
You okay?
Yeah, I think so. What happened?
Yeah, I think so. What happened?
I don't know, you just passed out.
I don't know, you just passed out.
I did?
I did?
Yeah, we were just standing there. You said something about your shoulder hurting, then you just hit the ground like a sack of potatoes.
Yeah, we were just standing there. You said something about your shoulder hurting, then you just hit the ground like a sack of potatoes.
Really?

Yeah, when you fell your head smacked the toilet hard. It scared the shit outta me. Sure you're okay?
Yeah, when you fell your head smacked the toilet hard. It scared the shit outta me. Sure you're okay?
Yeah, I guess. I'm just a little fucked up.

Well, let me tell ya something, gonna clear your head right up. We are officially Mexicans.

We are... "South of the border down Mexico way."
We are... "South of the border down Mexico way."
We are?
We are?
Yep. We're heading for the rendezvous right now. We get there, we pound booze till Carlos shows up, he escorts us to El Ray. And then me and you, brother, kick fuckin' back. How ya like them apples?
Far out. Where are my glasses?
They broke when you fell.
They broke when you fell.
Oh, fuck, Seth, that's my only pair!
Oh, fuck, Seth, that's my only pair!
Don't worry about it, we'll get you some glasses.
Don't worry about it, we'll get you some glasses.
What dya mean, don't worry about it. Of course I'm gonna worry about it, I can't fuckin' see.

When we get to El Ray, I'll take care of it.

Yeah, like a Mexican hole-in-the- wall's gonna have my fuckin' prescription.
Yeah, like a Mexican hole-in-the- wall's gonna have my fuckin' prescription.
It's not a big deal, unless you make it a big deal. Now, I'm real happy, Richie, stop bringing me down with bullshit.
That's what you think?
That's how you're lookin', Richie.
That's how you're lookin', Richie.
I'm lookin' scared?
I'm lookin' scared?
That's what you look like.
That's what you look like.
You know what you look like?

No, Richie, what do I look like?

You're lookin' green.
How?
Where are you right now?

What do you mean?

Where are you?
Where are you?
I'm here with you.
I'm here with you.
No, you're not. You're sippin' margaritas in El Ray. But we're not in El Ray. We're here -- getting ready to go in there. You're so pleased with yourself about getting into Mexico, you think the job's down. It ain't. Get back on the clock. That's a fuck-with-you-bar. We hang around there for a coupla hours, in all likelihood, we'll get fucked with. So

My shit is together.
My shit is together.
It don't look together.
It don't look together.
Well, it is. Just because I'm happy doesn't mean I'm on vacation. You're just not used to seein' me happy, 'cause it's been about fifteen fuckin' years since I been happy. But my shit is forever together.
Earth to Richie. Don't you wanna ask your new friend to join us?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, then ask her, dumb ass.
Well, then ask her, dumb ass.
Por favor, Senorita. Would you care to join us?
How are you?
Scarred for life, that's how I am!
How 'bout you? You are safer in here with us than wandering around a Mexican border town all night long. Just don't do nothin' stupid and we'll all get along fine. Scotty, you sure you don't want a drink?
Okay, I'll have one.
In that camper out there I saw a guitar. I take it that's yours.
Yeah, it's mine.
Yeah, it's mine.
Go out and bring it in. I feel a song coming on.
You could take their head off.
Actually, our best weapon against these satanic cocksuckers is this man. He's a preacher.
He's right, Kate. Daddy's dead! He was too far away. If flinging that door and filling this room with those bat-things would save him, I'd fling it. The only thing it'll do is turn us into one of them.
He needs our help!
He needs our help!
He's beyond our help. You saw him get bit. I saw him get bit. We all saw it. You can't help him. I've got no one left to lose but you. I can't be alone again. We're sticking together.
B.O.Q., south side. Take a starboard tack out the door.
Thank you, ensign.
Thank you, ensign.
No problem, lieutenant.
They take you away to San Clemente Island. Half the guys quit when they come back. Supposed to be just hell-and-a-half.
That's what I hear.
That's what I hear.
Can I ask you somethin', lieutenant? How come you're doing this? I mean, we're kinda curious.
Can I ask you somethin', lieutenant? How come you're doing this? I mean, we're kinda curious.
Who's "we"?
Who's "we"?
Just some of the women.
I don't know if there's any single reason. But my father was Navy. And he had this old-time recruiting poster in his den. It showed a girl trying on a sailor's uniform while saying, "Gee, I wish I were a man! I'd join the Navy!" Was maybe 10 years old when I first saw it, and even then it felt wrong. Made me mad.
I've been accused of that wish.
I've been accused of that wish.
The woman I saw you with...

Just a friend. We have friends, too, you know.
Just a friend. We have friends, too, you know.
But are there... I mean, how many...
But are there... I mean, how many...
More than you'd guess. It's just that we don't hold coffee klatches. If more then three of us get together at any one time, the guys think it's some kind of uprising.
Administration, Ensign Blondell.
Don't say my name.
Don't say my name.

"Wickwire, Thomas Dane." See what you can find.
Got it.
Who signed as his "sponsoring officer"?

Uh... don't see it. There's no signature. But hang on -- there's a note to "See Addendum." Checking...
Wow...
What'd you find, Kathy?
Commander, are you of the habit of letting photographers traipse around your base snappin' their fill? These were supposed to have been discreet test cases --

Are you truly mouthin' off to a senior member of the Senate Arms Committee? I mean, I'll give you points for style -- just nothin' for smarts.
Well, seein's how this thing is out, you let me handle the r.p.m. From this point forward, I want all press matters coordinated via my office. I'll be god-damned if I'm gonna watch Hayes pull flowers out of his ass and take credit for this one. Him or the President. This my shade? "Midnight Mahogany"? 'Cuz I'm comin' dangerously close to lookin' like Ronald
Your prerogative, Senator.

Jordan, dear. How are they treating you?
Uh, V.I.P. security arrangements generally take some time, Senator.
"Security"? What the hell you talkin' about? Your base isn't secure?

Of course, but there's more --

Then set out the good plates, we'll all have lunch. My office will follow up with details. Jumping off, now...
Yes, of course. Please, have a seat, lieutenant...
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Would you care for a beverage? Tea?
Would you care for a beverage? Tea?
I'm fine, sir.
I'm fine, sir.
So. We're still coming to terms with the exact protocol for this -- for integrating the Spec-Recon training. It may not always be smooth, but we're trying to make it as painless as possible for you.
So. We're still coming to terms with the exact protocol for this -- for integrating the Spec-Recon training. It may not always be smooth, but we're trying to make it as painless as possible for you.
Thank you, sir. But I expect a certain amount of pain.
Barber was my next stop, sir. Would've had it regulation sooner, only --
Don't worry about it. If it's off your collar and out of your eyes, that's all I'm going to ask.
Don't worry about it. If it's off your collar and out of your eyes, that's all I'm going to ask.
Really, I have no problem with --

I'm not out to change your sex, lieutenant. You'll have separate beds, separate heads. If you have specific medical needs, inform the infirmary. If a classmate or superior acts in an harassing or otherwise unbecoming manner, please inform me immediately so I can deal with it immediately. Questions?

None at this time, sir.
None at this time, sir.
Then that's all I have to say. Dismissed.
Sir, I just want you to know... I'm not here to make a statement. I don't want to make men look foolish. All I care about is completing the training and getting operational experience -- just like everyone else, I suspect.
If you were like everyone else, lieutenant, I suspect we wouldn't be making statements about not making statements, would we? Take your leave.
Pardon the hour, sir. But you told me to come to you immediately if I felt I was being mistreated in any way.
Didn't take long.
All right, lieutenant, give me a name and specifics, I'll have the X.O. file an action first thing in the morning. A name?
It's you, sir. And it started the day I came here.
It's you, sir. And it started the day I came here.
Oh, really.
Oh, really.
It's this double-standard, the separate quarters, the deferential treatment. It's how you pulled out my chair and nearly served high tea the first time we met.

Because I was civil, now you're complaining.
Because I was civil, now you're complaining.
I can't afford civility, sir. How am I supposed to fit in with these guys when you've got me set up as an outsider? Even if I make it under these rules, I still lose, because there'll always be a flag in my file -- "Yeah, she made it, but..." I mean, really -- why didn't you just issue me a goddamn petticoat to

Did you just have a brain-fart?
Did you just have a brain-fart?
Pardon?
Pardon?
Did you just barge in here and curse at your base commander? If so, I regard that as a bonafide brain- fart, and I resent it when people fart inside my home.

I think you've resented me from the start, sir.
What I resent, lieutenant, is some politician using my base as a test tube for her grand social experiment. What I resent is the sensitivity training that is now mandatory for my men... the day-care center I have to build where an officer's lounge used to be... and the OB/GYN I have to keep on staff just so someone can keep track of your
No, sir.
No, sir.
No, sir, WHAT?
No, sir, WHAT?
The shape doesn't bother me. It's just that goddamn rotten stench.
Well. 'Least now we're talking the same language. So one standard. Is that what you're after?
Same rules for everyone, sir.
Same rules for everyone, sir.
Straight up?
Straight up?
Across the board, sir.
Across the board, sir.
And if you just happen to wash out, I won't have to contend with you bitchin' to some hairy-chested female Senator? And please note I did not identify any one in particular.
And if you just happen to wash out, I won't have to contend with you bitchin' to some hairy-chested female Senator? And please note I did not identify any one in particular.
Wouldn't dream of it, sir.
Then good night.
So I'll get a fair shot?
So I'll get a fair shot?
You'll get everything you want, O'Neil. Let's see if you want what you're gonna get.
See me, sir?
You makin' friends with the press, lieutenant?
Sir, I want you to know that I had nothing to do with any of this. Not this article, not --
"We'll all have lunch." Good idea. Oh, and let's be sure to invite this sociologist, too -- just in case we want to have a FUCKING BRIDGE GAME AFTERWARDS!
Permission to leave, sir?
Permission to evaporate, O'Neil.
I don't know of any delicate way to say this, lieutenant, so I won't try. Claims have been made that you have engaged in fraternization -- of the same-sex variety. Specifically, that you were... "... seen leaving the apartment of another female officer at such a time and in such a manner as to suggest conduct unbecoming."
Sir, if someone is suggesting that I'm a lesbian, they're wrong.
I'm saying, we're just friends.
I find this as distasteful as you, lieutenant. But if it's on my desk, it's on my shoulders. There's going to be an inquiry -- it will not be quick and it will definitely not be pretty. You should prepare yourself.
I find this as distasteful as you, lieutenant. But if it's on my desk, it's on my shoulders. There's going to be an inquiry -- it will not be quick and it will definitely not be pretty. You should prepare yourself.
Sir, please... if there's any way to do this without dragging everyone through the mud...
Sir, please... if there's any way to do this without dragging everyone through the mud...
I don't see how, O'Neil. Dismissed.
Sir. If tomorrow... I was not under your command... would the inquiry still go forward?
I'm not sure what --
I'm not sure what --
Would you have the discretion to end it right then and there?
Well, if you had to go over my head, lieutenant, that's the way to do it. Christ, nothin' like a 0-200 call from the Commander and Chief to get the bowels movin'.
Sir? What did he say?
Sir? What did he say?
Basically -- he asked me if I could unring a bell.
Aw, what is this...
Sir...
Ah, c'mon...
Motherachrist...
Fine by me, sir!
No problem, sir!
Newberry, get a photo. South?
Entering my scan now...
Entering my scan now...
West?
Shit. Think we're had.
Smoke her.
Smoke her.
I ain't gonna shoot her.
I ain't gonna shoot her.
Only blanks. Lemme do it.
Only blanks. Lemme do it.
Hey. Ain't your call, man.
Banditos on the east perimeter! 150 yards! Shit, she was part of it!
Fuck me.
What, we're gonna pry 'em out with paddles?
O'Neil. Our air's gonna crap out as soon as we get down there. You know that, don't you?
White House boys want a private meeting.
I'll act surprised.
Think I overplayed it?
Congress and the Pentagon share a lot of plumbing. They'll never know whose leak it is.
Yes?

She made it through S.E.R.E. training. Got a call this morning from --
Not that. The White House just announced that it was sponsoring legislation that would, in one stroke, void all remaining elements of the 1948 Combat Exclusion Laws.
... last few years have brought many advances in the interests of women in naval service, particularly in the land-based maritime specialties. What's more, the Navy has instituted special sensitivity courses with an eye on --
Whoa, whoa, whoa. "Land-based maritime specialties." Gimme a second here to de-euphemize that...
Hardly the case, Senator.
Well, I'm just an old dame without much time left, so you'll pardon me if I jump right in here before they discontinue my blood-type. I am deeply concerned over the Navy's seemingly incontrovertible attitude toward women in the military. Case in point...
"The Lark Report."
Madam Senator... this is an internal document of the U.S. Navy. I must seriously question whether --
Madam Senator... this is an internal document of the U.S. Navy. I must seriously question whether --
The Navy's conclusion regarding the crash of an F-14 aboard an aircraft carrier. Female aviator, it just so happens. You're familiar with this report and its conclusion, am I right?

Yes, I see your signature right here -- twice the size of everyone else's. And your conclusion was "pilot error," hmm?

I'd like to think our next Secretary of the Navy would be prepared for anything, Mr. Hayes.
The commission concluded that the aviator in question failed to execute a proper approach to the carrier.
That aside for the moment, I'm struck by the tenor, the ill-spirit of your report... the degrading remarks by other aviators... innuendo about her performance in unrelated situations... even a reference to her sexual activity the weekend prior. In my seven years on this committee, I've never seen a downed aviator treated like this. Never. I'm deeply disturbed by this report, Mr. Hayes. Not
So everyone I talk to says you're top drawer with silk stockings inside.
Thank you, ma'am. Um, may I ask what this is regarding?

California.
I know that, sir. Ma'am. It's just that... Beggin' your pardon, Senator, but... do you understand that this involves combat training?

This is just a test case, O'Neil. But if it works out -- if you work out -- it could well change the Navy's official policy on women in combat. Or, actually, its official non-policy. Now who's your immediate superior there?

There'll be more to follow -- but yes, dear, right now you're the pick of a very large litter. And your success would mean a lot. Jumping, now...
Can't complain, ma'am.
Hmmm. Maybe I'll ask when I see you in person.

Gonna be visiting that all-woman's America's cup team in a few weeks -- If I were a gambler, I'd say Dennis O'Conner's days are numbered. But they're in San Diego, so I thought I'd take a quick promenade of the base.
Jordan. I always hoped we'd get together -- though just now I'm gearing up for a child-care vote that --
Lieutenant Thomas Wickwire.
You know him.
Sounds familiar.

Absolutely not.
Wickwire was there to help. To be my eyes on the inside, to make sure you were getting a fair shot. At least that was the intent.
What changed?
What changed?
Should probably ask him that.
Should probably ask him that.
If I have to ask again, Senator, I'll be asking in front of cameras.
So? Isn't the President jumping on your bandwagon?
What he did was light the bandwagon on fire. Because he knows what I know -- that American families are not prepared to put their daughters in harm's way.

I'm saying it's not going to happen. Not when the President is set to turn this into a third-rail issue should I choose to ever campaign against him. He will fry me six ways to Sunday for sending daughters and young mothers off to war -- and, quite possibly, for bringing them back in body bags.
You were never going to let women serve in combat. You always had a safety net. Or thought you did.
Jordan. I don't expect you to fully understand this -- but sometimes there's more to be gained from the fight than the victory.

I wanted the choice. The chance to prove myself, my skills, my work, me. That's how it should've been.
I once promised you a fast ticket, Jordan, and I always meant to make good on that. Come work for me. I can always use a hard-charger on my team.
You promise Wickwire a fast ticket, too?

Well, I spoke with Mr. Hayes this morning myself -- and told him the deal was off. No more test cases. He was only too happy to oblige. Don't play politics with me, little darlin'. You'd be up way past your bedtime.
So she picks the women, we pick the programs. Seals?
I'd go Special Reconnaissance. Every bit as tough -- and we have a 60 percent drop-out rate among the men.

Doesn't matter who she picks. No woman is going to last one week in a commando training course. And I don't care who it is.
What the hell is the President trying to do? Steal DeHaven's thunder?
I think it's more important, sir, to decide what we're going to do -- since it's apparent this issue is not going away quietly.

"G.I. Jane." And which one of you told me she wouldn't last a week? Huh?

Every class has its surprises, Pyro. This one'll be no different.

You're the analyst for East China, O'Neil. Analyze.
North Korean beaches are the best protected, most heavily monitored in the world. The civilian population is so propagandized that it acts as an Early Warning system. Extraction team has to be small and silent -- I'd go with Seals over Delta Force. Problem is, don't want to hold a conventional sub off-shore for target practice. Where's The Polk?
Halfway 'round the world. So that's the problem -- we can get the team in, just not out.

Wickwire said he was dry-docked in Washington between stints at Coronado...

So here we are again. Staring three years of operational duty in the face.
Look. It's not like you'd be completely out of reach. And maybe we could call in a few favors, get you stationed at Norfolk instead of Coronado. There are ways of dealing with these things -- I mean, if people are so inclined.

One time he was doing a rekkie of the Libyan coastline. This is, like, right before we bombed Khadaffi into the past tense. So his crew does a nighttime infil, maps all the big artillery placements and stuff, then turns around to get the hell gone. But between them and the water are five Libyan guards, all armed to the nuts.
They had to kill 'em?

Nah, they were dead-ass asleep. But on every guard's chest,they left one Marlboro cigarette. Just a little calling card to say they'd been there -- and could come back any time they wanted.

Could you have pulled that 210-pound man clear, lieutenant?
Females in combat situations impact unit cohesion. Men fight better without women around. And that is an historical fact.
It also seems like a problem with the men's attitude, sir. So maybe you should be sniffing around their shower room instead.
England went out with a stress fracture. That puts you in charge, lieutenant.

"Dad."

Right down to your worthless womb, and I'll tell you why. This is my island. My world. And here I can get away with shit that would get me arrested anywhere else in the world. Take another scan of my little joy- boy outside. If I can do that to a Navy Seal, what's gonna happen to you? Huh?
Why didn't you shoot the woman, O'Neil?
Wasn't deemed a threat.
Wasn't deemed a threat.
She led us right to you. That's no threat?
Would you have shot if it was a man?
No. Yes. I mean, depends on --

You think we should go easy on women, O'Neil?
Do you?
No.
No.
I'm so glad we agree.
Didn't you know you'd be raped if you were captured? Didn't you even think about that?
Sure. Just like your men do.
Sure. Just like your men do.
I think we oughtta practice it, just so you know what to expect.
Well, I'm trying to figure out if you're stupid, unlucky, gluttonous -- or some new alloy of all three.
Good to see you again, too, sir.
Good to see you again, too, sir.
Okay, O'Neil. So you've impressed all the others. Now try me.
Managed to activate the ELB. If you just radio base and let them know, they'll fix on that. Oh, and make sure they send a helo with a winch -- door's blocked by a reef. Over.

Got it.
Show us where you are, Chief.
O'Neil...
Shut up, sir. I'm concentrating.
Well, who the shit you think you are? Comin' in here like that?
Your new roommate.
Anybody usin' these drawers here?
Hey, hey, HEY. No possibility. You can't stay in here. You can't sleep right next to me.
Hey, hey, HEY. No possibility. You can't stay in here. You can't sleep right next to me.
Funny, the C.O. says I can.
Aw, lookit this, lookit this -- she's bringin' Tampax in here. C'mon, you got nothin' but rooms over there.
That your desk? I'll take this one.

WOULD YOU JUST GET OUTTA HERE?

Listen, Sex Ape. I'm here to stay. And if you don't want me for a roommate or classmate, you got two options -- move out or ring out. End of file.
Clear.
North?
All right, fire-and-evade maneuvers. Drop everything but weapons and the PRC radio -- we're gonna be high speed, low drag all the way to the link-up site. Ready?
Sure. Now she wants to shoot.
Sure. Now she wants to shoot.
MOVE!
I just wonder how that happened.
Cortez, see if you can dig out the tools without losing the rest of out gear. Try a wrench on that thing.
You don't suppose this is just part of...
FLEA! KEEP YOUR EYES ON THAT SPOT! Mark it, mark it! Cortez? What the hell you waiting for?
Maybe we should call the Coast Guard.
Shut your hole, Slutnik.
We're fucked.

Audrey's going to stay with us tonight.
Great. See ya then.
Who the hell are all these people?

You know how I spent last weekend? Walking his damned dog.
Animal, you don't think that's true, do you?
Nice guys finish last. First rule of the jungle.
Nice guys finish last. First rule of the jungle.
Well, I can be tough if I want.
That why you dumped him?
No! I just couldn't see myself with some boring egg head who spends his summer picking apart cockroaches. I wanted to have some adventure, some fun...
How long where you and dis guy goin' steady?
Nearly four years...
Great stuff, Animal. Weren't you scared?
Sure I was. I thought Lucy was gonna kill me.
He stole my report! That's my report!
We know, Audrey.
You okay?
It's all my fault. What have I done, Animal? What have I become? Look at me. This isn't me. I don't do things like this.
It's all my fault. What have I done, Animal? What have I become? Look at me. This isn't me. I don't do things like this.
You made a mistake.
Yeah, I just screwed up with the only man who ever really cared about me.
Didn't you tell me he left for the airport?
Didn't you tell me he left for the airport?
Yeah. Why are you asking?
Yeah. Why are you asking?
I just saw him. He's with a bunch of guys who want to sneak into the city tonight.
My God. He's going after the nest.
Perfect! You wanted a story, well, baby, you got one.
Animal, I can't.
Look, you want to make it up to your friend? Well if he's right, this is your chance.
What are you doing?
Lucy'd kill me if she knew.
What are you doing?
It's the maintenance entrance. Runs along the side of the tunnel. When they repaired it last year I worked on a piece about it.
Don't you think we have enough?
Yes. Definitely. Definitely enough.
Think we can fit up in there?
Only one way to find out.
He's not going to do it.
Oh yes he will.
Cut uptown, take 8th to 57th then cut up Broadway.

But we can get to the west side faster.
Audrey, did you take the tape out of the camera?
No.
I'll take them all.
You must have quite some harem.
Audrey?! Is that you? Hi, hello. You look, wow, uh, how've you been?
It's good to see you, Nick.
So you made it.
What?
You're a reporter. That's what you always wanted to be, right? I'm happy for you. Really, I am.
Yeah, well...
So, you still picking apart cockroaches?
No, I'm into earthworms now. You wouldn't be interested. They're real "boring" creatures. Very reliable, dependable, no surprises...

I'm sorry you feel that way.
Wait. I'm sorry. You're right. Eight years is a long time. Can I offer you a cup of tea?
Sure. I'd like that.
I still can't believe it. How does a guy go from an anti-nuke activists to working for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission?
When you and I use to attend rallies in college, we helped to create awareness. But from the inside now I can actually effect change. I never lost my idealism.

What else do you know about it?
...he's pregnant.
Are you sure?
Well, obviously these tests weren't designed for this but fundamentally they're looking for the same hormonal patterns that would indicate pregnancy.
I don't get it. If it's the first of its kind, how can it be pregnant?
The ultimate expression of evolution, it reproduces asexually. Think about it, all kinds of creatures have been known to travel great distances for reproduction. That's why he came to New York. Like every species of insufficient progenitors, he's nesting!
Nesting?
Nesting?
Yes. Do you realize that a creature like this could lay as many as a dozen eggs at a time!
Is this cause of me? Because of the story?
Well what the hell did you think was going to happen?

I shouldn't have to, Audrey. You're supposed to be my friend. I trusted you.
I didn't mean for it to turn out like this. Look, I lied to you. I'm not a reporter. When we broke up and I came out to New York I was so sure I'd make it. But I haven't. That's why I needed this story so bad. I just couldn't tell you I'm a failure.

Your station won't have any easier time contacting the military than I did.

Who was that French guy, anyway.
Oh, just some insurance guy.
And I'm supposed to remind you to call him on all of Caiman's expense p.o.'s.
Speak of the devil.
My life sucks.
Oh, please, your life doesn't suck. His life sucks.
I can't believe he put the moves on me. After everything I've done for him.
He's scum! As far as he's concerned you're just a pair of breasts that talk.
It's Nick! I know that guy. I know him!
Who is he?
Who is he?
He was my college sweetie! Look at him. He looks so handsome on t.v. What the hell is he doing in Panama.
Did Romeo have a name?
Nick Tatopoulos.
Four years. Girl, I'm surprised he didn't ask you to marry him.
That's the problem. He did.
What the hell are you doing?
Remember my friend we saw on t.v.?
Remember my friend we saw on t.v.?
Your old sweetheart?

Yeah, well he just turned up in New Jersey at the military command post. Somehow all this is related to what happened down in Panama. There's a story here. I know it. You got any tape or glue?

I left my forgery kit back at the office.
Wish me luck!
Audrey, I don't think this is a very good idea. Caiman finds out and he'll have your job.
Audrey, I don't think this is a very good idea. Caiman finds out and he'll have your job.
I'm tired of waiting for someone else to give me an opportunity, Luce. If there's a story here I'm going to find it.
Hey, do you have any glue in your bag?
What's it to you?

Mr. Caiman...
Mr. Caiman...
Call me Charlie.
Call me Charlie.
Mr. Caiman, I've been doing extra research for you after hours and weekends for nearly a year. And I've never asked for anything but this job is really important to me. I'm too old to be an assistant anymore. I need to know this job is going someplace.

I can't.

I've got something on this. I know a guy on the inside with the military...
I've got something on this. I know a guy on the inside with the military...
Not now. You got my bag?
You don't understand, I can get us information...
Listen, this is the time when the big boys have to go to work, okay Honey?
We did it! We've got the exclusive! Way to go, Audrey!
We? I don't think so.
We? I don't think so.
I want that story, Audrey. Remember you work for me.
I want that story, Audrey. Remember you work for me.
Not anymore. Mr. Caiman, I quit.
Hi. Nick Tatopoulos...
Ah, Elsie Chapman, paleontologist.
Three years digging up worms in Chernobyl? How did Mrs. Tatopoulos handle it?
Oh, I'm not married.
Oh, I'm not married.
Really? A girlfriend then?
Really? A girlfriend then?
No. Perhaps I work too much.
No. Perhaps I work too much.
You mean to tell me that there is no one who holds a special place in your heart?
Not for a long time, now.
Well, I think you're cute.
Well, I think you're cute.
Oh, thank you. Is she always like this?
Hence the radiation.
More than that. I believe this is a mutated aberration, a hybrid from the fall out in that region.
Evacuate Manhattan? That's over three million people. Has that ever been done before?
I don't think so.
I'm sorry about all this.
Me too.
Make sure they find that nest before it's too late.
I'll try.
Merde!
Allez, allez!
They will set the trap at thirty minutes to ten.
That is when we will go in.
We've secured the doors on both levels.
Where's Luc and Pierre?
Where's Luc and Pierre?
They didn't make it.
They didn't make it.
Nick, my men and I will hold them here. You will have to go and get help!
When we learned he could burrow his way through the tunnels we realized he could be out of the quarantined zone.
Christ. How many tunnels lead off the island?
Christ. How many tunnels lead off the island?
Only five, Sir. We've checked them all. He hasn't used any of them.
Only five, Sir. We've checked them all. He hasn't used any of them.
Have them sealed off.
Have them sealed off.
And how should we do that, Sir?
And how should we do that, Sir?
Fill them with cement, brick them up, put land mines in them, bombs, I don't know, just make sure that goddamned thing doesn't leave the island!
Who are they? Lieutenant, get those people away from there.
They are with me!

Excuse me, would you mind telling me what the hell I'm doing here?
Excuse me, would you mind telling me what the hell I'm doing here?
Follow me.
You didn't answer my question. In fact, for the last 18 hours no one has answered any of my questions.
We have a situation on our hands that requires your particular expertise.
Look, I may work for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission but accidents and spills are not my field.
We know.
Do you know that you just interrupted a three year study of the Chernobyl earthworm?
Yeah, you're the worm guy.
Yeah, you're the worm guy.
The radioactive contamination in that area altered the earthworm's DNA! You have any idea what that means?
The radioactive contamination in that area altered the earthworm's DNA! You have any idea what that means?
No, but I have the feeling I'm about to find out.
No, but I have the feeling I'm about to find out.
It means that due to a man made accident the Chernobyl earthworms are now over seventeen percent larger than they were before. Mutated by seventeen percent?
Seventeen percent, huh? Sounds big.
They're enormous! A new species created by man's recklessness. That's what I've been trying to tell you, I'm only a biologist. I take radioactive samples and study them.
They're enormous! A new species created by man's recklessness. That's what I've been trying to tell you, I'm only a biologist. I take radioactive samples and study them.
Then you're perfect. Here's your radioactive sample. Study it.
What sample?
You're standing on it.
That was a footprint. I was standing inside a footprint.
That's right.
That's right.
But there's no animal in the world that can make prints like that? Is there?
But there's no animal in the world that can make prints like that? Is there?
We're hoping you're going to help us figure that out.
Somebody must have seen it.
It happened so fast no one knew what hit them 'til is was over.
The radiation is not an anomaly, it's the clue. This creature is far too unique on every level to be some lost dinosaur.
Don't tell me why it's not, tell me what the hell it is.
Don't tell me why it's not, tell me what the hell it is.
What do we know? It was first sighted off the French Polynesian Pacific. An area that has been exposed to dozens of nuclear tests over the last thirty years.
You know, he's not an enemy trying to evade you. He's just an animal.
What are you suggesting?
What are you suggesting?
When I needed to catch earthworms, I knew the best way to catch them was not to chase them. I had to draw them out.
Well, yes. I did. Clearly he was injured and bled.
You see, all we need to do is get a better shot at it with weapons that don't rely on heat seeking...
You see, all we need to do is get a better shot at it with weapons that don't rely on heat seeking...
Um, excuse me, sir, but the situation's more complicated than that. The blood I recovered revealed that the creature is either about to lay eggs or already has.
No, it reproduces asexually. That's why we must find the nest. If we don't, dozens will be born, each one capable of laying eggs of its own. Very quickly we could be looking at an enormous population.
So after we kill the creature we'll begin a search for the nest.
So after we kill the creature we'll begin a search for the nest.
It may be too late by then. These eggs will hatch very quickly.
You gave them the tape?
No, it's still in my tent. It's...oh my God, she took it.
We think there's a strong reason to believe it may be hiding inside one of the buildings within the sequestered area.
But you don't know for sure!
General Anderson, the problem was the terrain. If we lure him out into a more open area such as this portion of Central Park... We should be able to take him down.
Last time you didn't even scratch it!
Last time you didn't even scratch it!
That's not true. Our worm guy, er, I mean, Dr. Tatopoulos found blood.
Do you have any idea what's going on out there? The phones are ringing off the hook with people screaming to be let back into the city.
We're sending divers into the river now to retrieve the body.
We're sending divers into the river now to retrieve the body.
That thing's dead. What the hell are we waiting for?
Organize a search party. I want a complete sweep of the entire city and subway system.
You don't have the authority to do that.
Are you looking for this?
Thanks.
Do I know you?
We've met before.
We've met before.
Oh yeah, the insurance guy.

We, have already taken care of them.
How did you get all of this stuff into the country?
This is America. There is nothing you can not buy.
So why all the secrecy? Why aren't you guys working with the US military?
I am not permitted to speak of such things.
I am a patriot. I love my country. Can you understand that?
Sure.
Sure.
It is my job to protect my country. Sometimes I must even protect it from itself. From mistakes we have made. Mistakes that we do not want the world to know about.

Your talking about the nuclear testing in the Pacific.
Your talking about the nuclear testing in the Pacific.
Yes. This testing done by my country left a terrible mess. We are here to clean it up.
Here. 23rd street subway station. Where we first found the fish. With a little luck, this will lead us right to it.
So you're in?
So you're in?
Are you kidding? I always wanted to join the French Foreign Legion.
What's with the chewing gum?
Makes us look more American.
They've turned off the ventilation system. They're calling him to dinner.
Let's hope we are not the hors d'oeuvres.
Three eggs. I thought there would be more.
You were right.
I think we should leave now.
Good idea.
Contact the military and get them to send a bomber to blow up this building before these things escape.
How do I do that?
How do I do that?
555-7600. Tell them it's a code dragonfly. They should get you through.
What'd they say?
I can't get through. I don't know what's wrong.
Who the hell are you?
It's okay. I know her.
Hello?
It's Raymond.

I understand.
I just wanted to say, au revoir and thank you for your help, my friend.

Dr. Lazarus... I hope that I'm not breaching protocol but.. I am so very humbled to stand in your presence... I have studied your missions extensively... Though I am Thermian, I have lived my life by your philosophy, by the code of the Mak'tar.
Well good, that's very... nice.

This is it?
Yes sir. Marvelous, isn't it? Completely distractionless.

Where's my bed?
Just as on your home planet, sir. If I may say, it took me three years to master the spikes, but now I sleep with a peace I never thought possible...
Is that the bathroom?
Is that the bathroom?
Yes sir... The use of your waste facilities were strangely absent from the historical records, so we had to extrapolate purely on the basis of your anatomy.
Dr. Lazarus, here is your surface mapper. I have programed it to the coordinates of a Beryllium Sphere of sufficient density.
Thanks.
Thanks.
Good luck on your mission, Sir. By Grabthar's Hammer, by the Suns of Warvan I wish you-

Sir! The pressure. It's normalizing.
Open.
Okay, Quellek, let's get back to the command deck and-Suddenly we hear a PISTOL BLAST and Quellek's chest turns RED. Alexander and Quellek look down at the blood, horrified.
I'm... I'm shot.
Not so bad. We'll get you to medical quarters. You're going to be fine.
I... I don't think I'm going to make it Sir...
I... I don't think I'm going to make it Sir...
No, don't talk like that, son. We're going to get you fixed up.
No, don't talk like that, son. We're going to get you fixed up.
... It has been my greatest honor to serve with you. LIving by your example these years, my life has had meaning. I have been blessed. Sir, I... I...
Don't speak, Quellek.
You'll forgive my impertinence, sir, but even though we had never before met, always considered you as a father to me.
Come on, old friend...
Friend. You stole all my best lines. You cut me out of episode two entirely!..
You WILL go out there.
I won't and nothing you say-
I won't and nothing you say-

I heard something. A squeal.
Fred's no good, Jason. You're going to have to kill it

Jason, before we entered the black hole, my instruments detected strange energy surge from Sarris' shiD~ similar to...
No time to worry about that, Alex. Tommy, let's get this thing slowed down... Gwen, see if you can calculate the impact point. Guy, cet down to deck C and make sure tne injured are secured. Also lets-
He's a twit!
Oh, and did you hear he booked another fan appearance without us?
Not again...
I played Richard III...
Settle down, Alex...
No. I can't go out there! I won't say that ridiculous catch phrase one more time. I won't. I can't!
What the hell is going on?!!?
Jason, what have you gotten us into?
He wants to THINK!?
No, Jason, that's a wrap! There's nothing to think about!
Could you possibly try not to hit every single one!
They're drifting toward me... I think they're magnetic!...
What's happened?
The engines are dead. We're drifting.
You were holding it upside down weren't you?
Shut up.
Shut up.

And note the sucked in gut.
...Sleeves rolled halfway up the biceps...
This is ludicrous. Why are you listening to this man? Must I remind you that he is wearing a costume, not a uniform?... He's no more equipped to lead us than THIS fellow. No offense.
You have a better plan, Alex?
You have a better plan, Alex?
As a matter of fact, I do. Look at their eyes. They're obviously nocturnal. Come sundown they will go into the forest to hunt. So our plan is simply to wait for nightfall instead of mounting an insane assault in full daylight simply because we did it that way in episode 31.'
He's a miserable twit!
The guy is terminally selfish!
Oh Alex, get away from that thing...
Dear God.... How did I come to this?
Alex you can't -just leave.
Oh can't I? Watch me!
Oh good, there's nothing to eat.

Yes, poor Jason. As we speak he's probably out somewhere talking rubbish to a roomful of hangers-on. While here I sit eating Christmas cheese in Spring.
Oh my god, It's real.
All this from watching the.. historical records?
We heard it the first time!
Shit! I'm doing it! I'm repeating the damn computer!
May I get the check?
The ships are gaining...
WE'VE HAVE TO STOP!
FRONT ARMOR IS GONE! JUST SLOW IT DOWN A LITTLE!
"Go into the cloud! ...
Alex? Where are you going?
Alex? Where are you going?
To see if there's a pub.
Look at that... Will you LOOK at that... They look like little children...
Could they be the miners?
I don't know.
Nobody was WATCHING?
Those blue things ate everybody here?
It doesn't make sense... Surely they could have fortified the compound against those creatures...
He knocked me out the sonofabitch. Where is he?
Down there.
You said "the Commander.

Back there. You said "the Commander is down there with a bunch of cannibals."

He dissed us AGAIN, Brandon!
He probably... Has some very important business to attend to...
Hi Brandon.
No time for pleasantries, Kyle. We have a level five emergency. The Commander needs us to get him to the core and shut it down before it overloads.

Commander, please settle a dispute that my crew and I are having. In "The Quasar Dilemma", the Sentient had taken control of the ship's guidance systems, however-
Excuse me guys.
Commander, as I was saying... In "The Quasar Dilemma", you used the auxiliary of deck b for Gamma override. But online blueprints indicate deck b is independent of the guidance matrix, so we were wondering where the error lies?
It's a television show. Okay? That's all. It's just a bunch of fake sets, and wooden props, do you understand?

Okay, we got it.
Okay, you can go on in... I'm going to get Kyle. He knows the utility tunnel system better than anybody alive.
Okay, now left at the next turn... Past the oxygen units. Make a right there. Then go through the antimatter vent...
Okay... Okay, now what.
Okay... Okay, now what.
Now make a right, you'll see a doorway that opens on the central manufacturing facility. The bowels of the ship.
Commander, do you have a camera? I'd die to see this in person... All they showed on T,V was a machine here, and a wall here... I don't know why they didn't show the whole thing.
We'd never have the budget for this.
We'd never have the budget for this.
Okay, so do you see a door marked "CORE UNIT?" Should be down at the far end to your left.

No, I am of the firm belief that in reality it is not a matter killer, but a matter REARRANGER, converting all molecules to the exact state they existed thirteen seconds previous to activation thus effecting a thirteen second time jump to the past.

BRANDON! TIME TO GO!
Yes Commander... All right, you're almost there. Just go through the chompers and over the pit.
Commander, you and Lt. Madison will have to go through the crushers one at a time in three second intervals. Tell me when the first crusher hits the bottom...
Okay, now. But-

Hey Commander. Listen, we found some Beryllium on a nearby planet. We might be able to get there if we re-configure the solar matrix in parallel for endothermic propulsion. What do you think?
I...Well, uh... Yes, absolutely.
A hologram...
Never mind, Fred....
Never mind, Fred....
No, no... I'll think on it...
The digital conveyer? You mean I'm going to get diced into cubes and sorted up there in a thousand pieces?
Right.
Right.
I'll take my chances with Gorignak.
No, I'll kill you. .
Listen Fred. You did this for four years on the show. You can do it now... Put your hands on the controls..
Fred, I worked summer stock with Hopkins. Regional theater with Hoffman. But I swear to God I have never met an actor who could hit his mark, or nail his lines with the professional consistency of a Freddy Kwan. You're Mr. Dependable... You can do this.
You worked with Hopkins? I worship Hopkins.
As good as Hopkins?
Hopkins can't drink your bathwater Fred.

Listen, I was wondering, would you guys mind if I sit in today? See if anybody's interested in an autograph? Never know.
Sure, Guy, If you can stand the excitement.
"Crewman #6"... Call me Guy.
You... know us?
THAT'S why you built this ship?
It's ... incredible.
The Omega 13... Why does that sound so familiar?...
The lost footage. At the convention. The mysterious device in our last episo--historical document.
Guy, you HAVE a last name. We just don't KNOW it.
Do I? DO I? For all you know I'm just "CREWMAN #6"! Okay, it's FLEEGMAN! Guy FLEEGMAN! There! Now I'm a whole person! I can't die! FLEEGMAN! THEY CAN'T KILL ME NOW, CAN THEY? CAN THEY?

Something BAD happened here.
Oh, they're so cute.
Of course they're cute NOW. But in a second they're going to turn MEAN and UGLY somehow and then there are going to be a million MORE of them!...
I am SO SICK of being right.
Let's get out of here before one of those things kills guy.
How the hell is Fred supposed to project a hologram?
We're doing episode 31, Jason?
...Okay
All right. Put me back on with him.
They're still behind us...
We should have a turbo. I'm always saying "activate turbo boosters", right?...
Guy, you're not going to get killed on the planet, okay?
Oh, I'm not? I'm not? Then what's my last name?

No. Nobody does. Do you know WHY? Because my character Isn't IMPORTANT enough for a last name. Because I'm going to DIE five minutes in, why bother to come up with a last name for me?
We're screwed... We're so screwed...
All right, let's all settle down. If we're going to get through this we're going to have to exercise self control.
That's it, that's what's going to kill me.
Let's just pick up the pace a little, shall we?
It doesn't have to be a hologram... Just a diversion.

Listen, Sarris, you can't blame me for trying...
Maybe we can lose them in that cloud.
I don't think that's a cloud...
Are they behind us?
No, I don't think so... Wait. They're not but... Something is. Oh my god.
Can it be repaired?
Computer, can it be repaired?
Do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard?

Did it ever occur to you that if you had been a little more supportive you could have held on to me?
Did it ever occur to you that if you had been a little more supportive you could have held on to me?
I could have held on to YOU! ...
You're playing your good side.
Don't be ridiculous.
All right... here's the plan: First, Fred, we need a diversion to clear those things out of the compound, then Gwen, Alex, Fred and I go down to get the sphere. Any of those things come back, give a signal. Guy, you set up a perimeter.
Why does this sound so familiar?
How does the rolling help, actually?
It helps.
Clenched jaw...
Will you stop RIDING ME?!
Jason.. Can you hear me?
Yes. Yes, I'm here!
Thank God. Are you okay?
Yeah. But I've got Gorignak staring me in the face. I think I can take it though...
Yeah. But I've got Gorignak staring me in the face. I think I can take it though...
Jason, we're going to use the digital conveyer to get you out of there.
What? What did he say?
Nothing. Hold please.
Wait, the pig lizard is gone. Why are they still chanting for the pig lizard?
Turn on the translation circuit.
Jason?... I don't think the pig lizard was Gorignak...
What the hell are you talking about?
So... We get to shut down the neutron reactor?
Right.
Right.
Uh... I hate to break it to you Jason, but I don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor, and unless you took a Learning Annex course I don't know about, I'm pretty sure you don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor either.

You gotta admit, they do love him.
Almost as much as he loves himself.
That's it, It's go time.
Don't do it, Tommy. He's not worth it.
You should have let me hit him.
I don't know guys... I mean, he almost looked... sincere. I know, it's bizarre!
You know, that's really getting annoying.

I can't... It's on autopilot!...
We got the Sphere but the Commander's down there with a bunch of cannibals! Teb, reset the pod, we're going back.
That thing's not going to get us down there fast enough. Face it, he's dead.

Better than my Lieutenant. He failed to activate ship's neutron armor as quickly as I'd hoped on our last encounter.
Right. Well... Listen, I'm I'm sorry about that whole... thing.. before. It was kind of a misunderstanding. I'm sure we can work this out like reasonable people... How's the uh... ... that going to heal up? God, I hope so, I feel just awful about that.

Commander, I must speak to you. It is a matter of supreme importance... We are Thermians from the Klatu Nebula, and we require your help. I beseech you to come with us, back to our ship. A great many lives hang in the balance...

We have become aware of these concepts only recently. In our dealings with Sarris. Often Sarris will say one thing, and do another. Promise us mercy and deliver destruction... It is a concept we are beginning to learn at some great cost. But if you are saying that any of you could have traits in common with Sarris.

Unfortunately, I'll never get the chance. I'm leaving in an hour for Congress to scream like a violated virgin about my promotion. Wasting my time, naturally... Look at her teasing those bumpkins.
What does she see in them?
I'm accused of using some government wagons to ship personal property.
Congress has been using our supply wagons for years to ship their black market goods -- probably their whores!
We've got to attack the British! Now! Have they put you in charge yet? Do we have an army yet? What is happening?
Patience, Colonel Arnold. Active personalities terrify these men. But, congratulations on your victory at Ticonderoga...
I capture Quebec leading an Army by river fordings through Maine... If we don't do it, the British will come down Champlain, take back Ticonderoga and attack us in the spring.

I've come to report that we've had a bit of luck!
Damn-it! You've given us a whole new season, Benedict! And Congress thinks that the British are going to ride right over us come spring. Now half their army is back in Canada.

We're in bad shape, Benedict, moral is low. Before I can do anything, I need Lee and his seven thousand troops. I've ordered him to join us three times. In my last letter I all but begged him to come here. The man is insubordinate.
The man's waiting for you to get wiped off the stage so he can become commander and chief.

Our plan is to hit them as they leave.
While they're strung out?
While they're strung out?
Exactly. We'd attack the baggage wagons and the rear guard. It would cause the line to buckle. Then we hit the center with our main force and cut them in half.
They're ready. Believe me, the ones that stayed on here at Valley Forge are ready for anything. Of course, we get nothing from Congress. They need boots, coats... we desperately need food.
Same old story.
There was this anonymous pamphlet circulated at Congress which says I am personally responsible for all our hardships. And... that I have encouraged the people of America to make me into a God! Benedict, it says that I have gone mad!

That scum Joseph Reed... they're calling him the 'King of Pennsylvania'. The man's a budding Cromwell. He condemns rich Tories to death and then 'appropriates' their property for himself. Naturally, the pig hates me for every Tory I've saved.
Couldn't you have appealed to Congress?
They love Reed and his inquisition! I think they hope to share in his disgusting profits! It's becoming the American way!
You go too far, Benedict.
These men were taken from their homes at night, tried by Reed's courts -- which Congress recognizes -- and, well, you can see.
Cut those men down. Congress is pushing ahead with your court-martial. Benedict, trust me to handle this.

General Washington, is there actually going to be a compromise, I mean, a 'deal' with England?

They go back home to keep their families alive, stay into the spring to plant. Then, they start coming back to us.
What are we going to do?
Get the body of our army up to Greene's vanguard as fast as we can. All the damned fool has to do is hit the British rearguard and then hold for us.
General Greene is here. There are two other divisions here.
Colonel Hamilton. Anyone who served under Arnold, I want them shipped north. I don't want any troops here who served under Arnold.
Yessir.
Did you know that Arnold left the entire defenses of this fort in complete disrepair? Most of our cannons are so neglected they may as well have been spiked!? You realize what would happen if this fort fell? The whole Hudson would be open to them!
Sir, I think no such thing.
Don't lie to me, Hamilton! If I had not court-martialed Arnold...
Don't lie to me, Hamilton! If I had not court-martialed Arnold...
Sir, Arnold is a traitor.
Sir, Arnold is a traitor.
I must tell you sir you treat me with disrespect!
I must tell you sir you treat me with disrespect!
I am not conscious of it, sir! But since you have thought it necessary to tell me so, we part!
What is this?
Congress has informed the army that it is bankrupt and cannot pay the soldiers pensions.
This is a declaration of insurrection! Who wrote this!?
No one knows...
George, remember that night when we were drinking with Arnold?
To hell with Arnold...
To hell with Arnold...
He warned you some day you might have to act for the good of the people -- even if it was against Congress. George, the time has come for you to declare yourself king of America. Listen to me, the whole army would rise up as one and place you on a throne! George, you must declare yourself with us or against us.

Is this a coup? Alexander, are you trying to tell me that I might be assassinated if I don't agree?
What's your advice, Alexander?
March on Philadelphia! Get Joseph Reed, and the pigs in Congress, the speculators, who've grown fat off the war! Get them all! Sweep them aside!
I want to address the officers, all the officers. Next Friday. Can we arrange it at the mess?
Yes, I believe so.
Yes, I believe so.
Well, if it's my last order, then I order them to be there! Tell them I will give them my decision then.
Have you decided if you are going to join the Virginia Delegation to the Constitutional Convention?
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure.
George, you're the only man the people trust... trust with power. They know you won't betray them.
George, you're the only man the people trust... trust with power. They know you won't betray them.
But it's more than just that, am I right?
That's why the people trust you George. Without someone at the convention, who has the people behind him, everything will fail. Will you do it?
You're asking me to be president of a republic, not king? Not a dictator over subjects?
Horatio! Horatio Gates, of course you know John Adams of the Massachusetts Delegation.
Good day, Mister Adams... George, what's the word from Boston?
Good day, Mister Adams... George, what's the word from Boston?
The last I heard, a bunch of drunken militia have dug in on Breed's hill. With one stroke the British could cut them off and apparently their leaders are too dumb to see it.

Who's in command out there?

Who the hell knows? Everyone's giving orders. It's all very democratic.
Who the hell knows? Everyone's giving orders. It's all very democratic.
George, we've got to get you out there before we lose our whole army.
Well, John Adams, your cousin has a marvelous gift.
Yes, an astonishing power over weak minds.
With your support, Horatio. As one of our own who has seen combat with the British, your opinion counts.
As does your ability, Horatio. We must talk further, when it's more convenient.
You won't be needing his largess, Rhode Island is already committed to your appointment.
I don't know: delivering men and delivering men with their goodwill are two different things. And, if he's popular with his men...
Colonel Charles Lee... Hounds and all. Quite the character. He's got a tremendous reputation.
I think many would like to see him commander-in-chief.
If he supports the British why is it that every time he gets near them he kills so many of them? Unlike General Lee... who you and Congress backed for second in command and who is a goddamned incompetent!
Lafayette is a child!
Lafayette is a child!
Lafayette is my friend! He believes in glory and truth and the freedom of all mankind; so, of course he's a child. But he would have died before he would have let me down.
George, I'm sorry. We all know the army will acquit Arnold...
Of course the army will acquit him, that's not the point... Arnold is a man and will understand. What I need to understand is, John, Sam... what is happening here? Who are those people in there? The fat ones in silk?
Of course the army will acquit him, that's not the point... Arnold is a man and will understand. What I need to understand is, John, Sam... what is happening here? Who are those people in there? The fat ones in silk?
They are... friends of Congress.
They are... friends of Congress.
Is that where our meat and boots and uniforms and muskets went?
Washington is perfect. He's a Southerner, he's a war hero and he's rich!
He's from Virginia -- there is no more classist, elitist... English place on earth than Virginia. And, what in hell has he done for our cause? Washington has been preaching compromise, compromise, compromise! Hancock acts, he led the Boston Tea party! That's why New England loves him.

Hancock led the Boston 'tea party' because he's a goddamned tea smuggler! He wasn't protesting inequality, he was eliminating competition. Now, you listen to me: we need to get a Southerner elected commander-in-chief, or the south will not fight! What have we been struggling for all these years? For this moment! And, if we fail now, remember: you stopped us!
Let's not over do it...
I tell you every damned place I go the man is adored! "General Washington! Champion of Trenton! Savior of the Republic!" And you should hear the way people are deprecating Congress!

Gag on your own invention, then.

Oh, come now...
Oh, come now...
You invented this, this...
You think that?
He has the soul of an aristocrat who'd like nothing more than to become a king in the minds of the people!
No one wants another failure right now, God knows. But people like Arnold and, God knows, I'm having my fears about General Washington.
Finally!? It's people like these who, as soon as they get a little power, want more and more. More ale, here!
Finally!? It's people like these who, as soon as they get a little power, want more and more. More ale, here!
Again, just to touch on a touchy subject, but... would the people accept another leader over Washington?
Partially...
It's the political 'cost of doing business', George.
I doubt Arnold will be afraid.
If he isn't, then he's stupid.
Did God ever make such a pitiful army?
These men have suffered but I believe they will fight.
No officer is going to get these men to fight! They had the life crushed out of them on Long Island. At the most, perhaps we could make a feint at an outpost, then retire to protect Congress.
I hear General Lee is holding seven thousand fresh infantry back in New York -- why won't he come on!?

The British army, sir!

The British Army is right back there, across that river! Sir! I think it must be something else that detains General Lee.
Congress is bitterly opposed to allowing Negroes in the army!
We already have black soldiers in our army...

What's the difference?
Any word from Canada?
Spies from Quebec confirm that the British are sending an entire fleet down Lake Champlain...

A fleet?
My God... They mean to finish us. What about Arnold? He's up there.
What can he do? The British have massive superiority.
If we have any hope for a compromise or truce with England now, we have to hold on here: our men must believe they can win -- the British must believe that somehow, in some mad, impossible way we might actually be able to hurt them.
I understand, George.
Colonel Reed...
George! So good to be back!
That damned Arnold is here, isn't he? Did you know he lost all his ships? Outrageous and completely unacceptable.
Joseph, the British spent thousands of pounds and precious months putting together a fleet that Arnold stopped by sacrificing a heap of old barges. In my opinion he saved my army.
Joseph, the British spent thousands of pounds and precious months putting together a fleet that Arnold stopped by sacrificing a heap of old barges. In my opinion he saved my army.
Well, George, Congress just passed a resolution censuring Arnold for destruction of government property. I wouldn't cast my fate with that man.
A grand scheme?
A ground swell-Christian movement, George, you see?
A ground swell-Christian movement, George, you see?
No. As a matter of fact I haven't the slightest idea what you're talking about.
No. As a matter of fact I haven't the slightest idea what you're talking about.
To assert the rights of our founding fathers! This country was colonized by Christians! This shall become a Christian revolution. Surely as a good Christian you understand that!
What do you mean you're not a Christian? Of course you're a Christian, we're all Christians...
I mean, I'm a Deist. A belief I share with the likes of Tom Jefferson and Ben Franklin. Surely you knew that.

No, I did not. Really? Well, what the hell is a deist, precisely?
But the Hessians are there! No one can beat them! That's why Cornwallis stationed them there! They have the post of honor! They are invincible!
They are also very religious. So, we will attack them three days from now, on Christmas. One force under me, and another to the south under Colonel Cadwalader...

George, I'm afraid if you go through with this madness I must tender my resignation as your aide. I see where we're headed, you're putting your trust in the likes of Hamilton and Arnold...

Understand? You need to be listening to people like John Adams, and to keep the best interest of the country first in your mind!
Joseph, are you afraid to cross that river with me? I accept your resignation. With regret. You have leave to return to Philadelphia...
Gentlemen, let me get to the point, I can't see the wisdom of pursuing this old court-martial against General Arnold.
The man is a traitor!
The man is a traitor!
How can you say that?
Arnold is indispensable, do you understand? I need Arnold to help me win this war!
Well, I shall deny him to you! He is evil on earth!
Well, I shall deny him to you! He is evil on earth!
Are you all going insane!? Benedict Arnold! The man who stopped the British on Lake Champlain! Who carried the day at Saratoga! Goddamn-it, Joseph, you own two mansions, ride in an expensive, Tory coach! You are all nothing but a pack of greedy pigs!
However, through my relations with members of his majesty's court, I am a representative of the French government whose deepest desire is to be one people, united with our American brothers in arms to defeat the rapacious armies of King George of England. Vive la France! Vive l'Amerique!
We have more officers created by Congress than we know what to do with.
We have more officers created by Congress than we know what to do with.
But, general, I assure you my motives are sincere.
Sir, please accept my commission from Congress... and... You must see this portrait of my beautiful wife, Adrienne, we had the most perfect little baby girl just before I left. Her name is Henriette...
What I want to know is sir: where is your daddy?
Gentlemen, my I introduce a French gentleman, recently appointed major general by Congress... Marie Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette. General Lafayette has brought us the greetings and goodwill of his countrymen, and... how many cases of muskets, Mon petite Marquis?
Uh... none just now, but...
'Continentals', Congress' paper money. It was worthless to start with, but as you see, counter feiters have made them even less than worthless. Can you tell which one is fake?
I... they look both the same.
I... they look both the same.
The one with 'Philadelphia' spelled correctly is the counterfeit.
No, please; an advance on your salary.
Mon General, I have come here to learn and to give, not to take. I am serving without salary.
Mon General, I have come here to learn and to give, not to take. I am serving without salary.
You must be very rich.

I am. Then, I understand you too serve without salary. You know, since your charming little victories at Trenton and Princeton, the French court is softening. I expect any time now a ship load of supplies...
I am. Then, I understand you too serve without salary. You know, since your charming little victories at Trenton and Princeton, the French court is softening. I expect any time now a ship load of supplies...

These supplies...?

Muskets and uniforms and Bayonets.
Muskets and uniforms and Bayonets.
And how rusty are these muskets?
And how rusty are these muskets?
Sir, these are our finest firearms from the armory at Charleville! They are a gift from the people of France!
Well, we will accept these charming little gifts. When we see them. Meanwhile, please, take your pick of a horse.
I rode here, on my horse.
I rode here, on my horse.
Chose another. Any general worth anything should have a brace of horses.
Because, if the British got off their asses and came up here, now, we would be smashed. And the revolution would be finished. Tell King Louis, it's that bad.
Yes, I will write him and tell his ministers and the court.
Like flowers after the snow melts.
When the snow melts, mon petite Marquis, I suspect the only thing blossoming will be bright red British soldiers.
What is it, Marquis?
My baby daughter has died... my baby... mon petite Henriette...
My God! Who ordered this retreat?!
General Lee, sir!
General Lee, sir!
Get these men back in line!
I feel the same, sir.
I will continue with our French allies, concentrating on New York.
It's another demonstration against the king. This is the wildest yet.
My God, these people mean to go to war! They really mean it.
My God, these people mean to go to war! They really mean it.
Surely you knew this was coming.
Surely you knew this was coming.
War? No! I did not! When you said compromise was possible I believed it was probable. There's no middle ground at all? We're the King's children!
Our beloved father, the King, also refuses to bend.
But to go to war over trade, over money? Surely there's still time for a compromise.

The eternal dream of the disenfranchised, my dear: a classless world. Not a very real expectation.
Well, a very real expectation is the British will hang you! They'll burn Mount Vernon and they'll hang you! Our marriage is a business just as surely as...
I'm very aware of that.
I'm very aware of that.
I can not allow the fortune in slaves my first husband created and what our partnership has elevated, to be destroyed...

Don't be ridiculous, of course that won't happen.
Don't be ridiculous, of course that won't happen.
Have you been reading what Minister Jefferson has to say? If he had his way, all our slaves would be freed no matter what the outcome. And that would destroy us as surely as a British victory.
The day Tom Jefferson frees a slave I'll ride naked through the streets of Williamsburg on a mule. Tom Jefferson is one of those people who talks big and acts small. The only man out there who really does what he says is Sam Adams and everyone thinks he's crazy. Believe me, this 'disturbance' isn't going to last long. You have to understand, congress
And, what 'prize' do you see? What could we possible gain?
And, what 'prize' do you see? What could we possible gain?
Everything. If we force Britain into concessions it will open up the western lands -- and that would be a boon for our family. We already have more slaves than we need, but we need more land.
But, as usual, it will not go well for... them. Martha, you must trust me.
You're no fool, George. You never have been.
"Liberty, Virtue, Country"... That's from Cato... you know, that play about the noble Romans? As I was riding up to Philadelphia, I found myself thinking about the old days...
When you lived with the Fairfaxes?
When you lived with the Fairfaxes?
When I was a young man we used to recite Cato... We would come together recite it like they were words from heaven. Devotion to country, duty, purity of heart... Purity of heart. I was drunk on something then...

That's when Sally Fairfax was tutoring you...
That's right...
And have you heard anything from our dear friend, Sally? What with all the rumors getting back to England. I thought she might inquire after us. But then I believe she always looked down on us.
Did you know that Jefferson has proposed a law in Virginia aiming at an absolute separation of state from the church?
I think I heard that.
I think I heard that.
It's an anti-Christian dogma! I cannot believe you are so calm about it!
It's an anti-Christian dogma! I cannot believe you are so calm about it!
What else? From Virginia?
What else? From Virginia?
Well, I wouldn't want to trouble you with this now.
Martha... what?
Virginia is outraged with your order allowing Negroes to fight in the army. There's a deep feeling of hurt and betrayal. They wanted you commander because they expected you would look out for our interests.

Don't condescend to me! We have both of us prospered from the arrangements of our kind...
Our 'kind'? What is that supposed to mean? These men are all I have left and they stay because they will fight! They desire it! They seek it! Of course Virginia is terrified! For my soldiers this is a war to obliterate the 'upper class' from the face of the earth! Should I tell them all to go home because if they win it
Well, we must keep in mind the Dower Laws. One third of everything we have is mine and since our Negroes have been interbreeding, it would be legally impossible to distinguish them.
Martha! For God's sake!
Martha! For God's sake!
Leave me, now sir, I am tired.

Come out and meet my soldiers. They're good people.

Colonel Washington? Colonel Nathanael Greene, Rhode Island Militia.
Yes, yes, happy to meet you.
Yes, yes, happy to meet you.
I... I'm possessed of the idea of a command in your army, sir.
I... I'm possessed of the idea of a command in your army, sir.
It isn't my army yet, Colonel Greene. Looks like you've seen some action -- did you hurt your leg, in a fight?
It isn't my army yet, Colonel Greene. Looks like you've seen some action -- did you hurt your leg, in a fight?
I was born with a limp, sir. The Militia used to hate it when I marches with them because my pike would always sway...
But, you do come from a military family?
I have commanded the Rhode Island Militia for a year now. My father is an ironmaster. As was I.
A horseshoer?
Yes, but I've spent the last winter studying all the great battles of history. And I read the lives of Caesar, Alexander, Hannibal... Sir, I'm volunteering you the wholehearted support of the Rhode Island army.
The only way to get discipline into these men is to beat it into them! Fifty lashes each!
Sir, Congress hasn't issued their pay for two months, many have not eaten properly for at least that long. You're being a little hard on them, don't you think?
Sir, Congress hasn't issued their pay for two months, many have not eaten properly for at least that long. You're being a little hard on them, don't you think?

Well sir, I was an ironmaster before you got me. Maybe I will let you down yet.
I certainly didn't mean you. Of course you are a gentleman, an officer and a gentleman.
You wrong me, general; I am an officer and a horse-shoer.
General Greene?
I'm with Captain Hamilton.
I'm with Captain Hamilton.
Yes, I thought that's how you'd feel, Nathanael.
They're just disgusting, jealous, bottom-feeding swine. It's their nature.
You have a free tongue, Captain Hamilton.
Sir, if you don't mind my saying, I don't understand your history at all. I mean, why would you want to win the war? You're not after glory, like Benedict... You're a slave owner, and yet you invite blacks to fight in your army.
You don't believe I can fight from a sense of duty and patriotism?
You don't believe I can fight from a sense of duty and patriotism?
No. We're all of us after something. It's easy for me to fight for the common man. My father could only dream that I would be... a general someday? And what of my daughter or son? I know what I'm after. But now, with all this talk about compromise? It means the rich will just be more wealthy and the common man has no

I will not betray you, Nathanael.
I will not betray you, Nathanael.
But you are an aristocrat and a slave owner. Sir.
At one time I could have chosen not to be.
Then, maybe I do see what you're after -- perhaps... you get to chose again...
What the hell are we doing?
You've got to stop them here or our whole line will cave-in! It's all right boys, I'm here!
Nathanael, I'm sending you to Virginia to head the southern army, to harass Cornwallis. Marquis, you must go with him.
I'm honored, but, reluctant to leave you.
Sir, I have to act on instructions from you ordering thirty copies of your own dress uniform...
They're for my bodyguard. I have an absolute conviction that Arnold is planning to have me assassinated! It will be harder if I am surrounded by a body of men who look like me, don't you think?
They're for my bodyguard. I have an absolute conviction that Arnold is planning to have me assassinated! It will be harder if I am surrounded by a body of men who look like me, don't you think?
Yes sir, it's a wise idea...
Well, this must be about something!
It is; we need you George.
If the constitution is ratified... we'll have a country. They'll want to elect you president of the convention, which means president of the country.
You know, I came back to Mount Vernon to retire. I don't need to be in government.
Well, the widow Curtis will bring you riches, position, land, even half-grown children. You won't have to do anything at all! You shan't have to do another thing to prove yourself.
You know very well who it is that I love.
You know very well who it is that I love.
Is that the truth? Well, we can't carry on like animals any longer.
George, you know I only love you, but...
But not more than your comfort.
But not more than your comfort.
And what is this, then? Been off to fight the French because you are a patriot? Or is this you, gaining your long sought after rise in society by becoming victorious in war!?

That's a lie!
That's a lie!
Is it? William says now you have requested a British Commission, why not colonial? I'll clear it up for you, sir, because as a British officer you can lord over colonial yokels -- more than that, it will even get you into polite society! Your dream come true, George, the only dream that really matters to you.

Now that is a lie! See how much you want to create a scandal in exchange for a glowing reputation and polite society laid at your feet! When you break off your engagement to Martha Curtis, I'll divorce William! Do you hear? You get what you want from this world, then throw it all away on love!

I'd throw everything away for you.
You remember, George, when we were 'studying' the great philosophers?
I remember a pair of young philosophers once, who laughed at the world.

Well, I remember a philosopher who said something that I used to think was just another of those stupid class denouncements... but which I now see means us all.

So, you are William's wild young neighbor? Or should I say, 'brother'; William claims you as a member of his family. I have heard so many unflattering tales about you, and I understand, that except for you, this 'family' is quite cultivated.
George, I'm sorry.
George, I'm sorry.
Oh, but you must not mind my talking about you! In fact, William says my main job here at Belvoir is to civilize you; to make an honest English gentleman out of you.

That's not what I said! Now, Sally, you're embarrassing me! Watch out for her, George; she talks refinement, but she has a barbarous soul!
We can grow three primary crops in a season and, if we have some luck, we get a forth. The temperature is generally mild.
Except for that, quite like home; England, that is.
Except for that, quite like home; England, that is.
Hear that, George? Sally's actually taken to thinking of this clod of earth as her home. And it's her first tour. We're gratified, aren't we George?
Think what the play means, William. Perhaps these words have a place in the real world.
Words, words, words! Sally has been tutoring George in the philosophies, isn't that right?
Where... do those men come from, George?
Africa, of course.

The word 'minuet' finds its source in minitus, which is Latin meaning 'small' or 'orderly'.
Or, 'civilized'.
Or, 'civilized'.
In the minuet, George, every movement is significant, like the strut of cranes...
Cranes? Who needs to walk like a crane?
That's just my interpretation. Actually it's a dance designed as a sentiment of courtly manners. You see? Walk in a gently 'Z'. There are four distinct movements...
What do you really think of the minuet, anyway?
It's stupid, of course.
Then why are you teaching me...?
Perhaps you best ask, why you wish it. You asked William to teach you manners, philosophy, decorum... as I said, it's completely stupid.
I always though London was the place to be: capital of the world, the most spectacular city on earth.
The place to want to be is America. Every English child dreams of it. I dreamt it.
The place to want to be is America. Every English child dreams of it. I dreamt it.
I think America suits you.
Do you? When I saw those men yesterday in the field... and the women and children in those hovels? I'm not so sure if America is as far from England as I'd hoped.
It's the freest land on earth.
It's the freest land on earth.
Is it? Well, I'm scared of what we've become in our freedom.
Is it? Well, I'm scared of what we've become in our freedom.
Well, we must be who we must be...
And to think I am teaching you to become one of them...
What else should I become? There's no difference between Virginia and England. I must be educated if I'm to take my place in society. My father couldn't afford to send me to England for school -- he made a shambles of our fortunes. Everyone laughs at me.
I don't laugh at you, George. I like you. I like you because you will never, ever make it as an aristocrat... and that's because you're completely incompetent at hiding your feelings.
I think I will disappoint you.
What are you doing?
Let's get you darker!
Let's get you darker!
You're out of your mind!

Those people? I doubt they'd think of this. Ooo, you're wonderful this color!
I've been surprised in an unguarded hour, But must not now go back; the love that lay, Half smothered in my breast, has broke through all, Its weak restraints, and burns in its full lustre. I cannot, if I would, conceal it from thee.
I'm lost in ecstasy! And dost thou love, Thou charming maid?
I'm lost in ecstasy! And dost thou love, Thou charming maid?
And dost thou live to ask it?
Remember, George, "It is dangerous to be right in matters on which the established authorities are wrong."
That's good... who?
That's good... who?
Voltaire, of course...
You are a slave owner! You have been illegally surveying lands beyond the Ohio Valley! That land belongs to the natives!
That land belongs to the strongest.
All people have rights!
Just because they are born?

Yes!

Are these philosopher going to be here to help you fight your war? You know why I don't trust revolutions? Because each of us is who we are: we make speeches, print pamphlets, and we never change. The world is not a philosophical abstraction, Mister Adams, it's us. And, I don't believe you can ever change human nature.
You hear that?
That? I hear a mob: unemployed, drunkards, vagabonds... the world's dregs.
That? I hear a mob: unemployed, drunkards, vagabonds... the world's dregs.
Well, I hear 'The People'. Indentured servants, freed slaves... escaped slaves. The world's castaways. And, my fear is, in the scramble for power that's coming, you will betray them.
Is that your test of patriotism, George; if a man will die for you?
God damn you, Sam Adams! You wanted a revolutionary army and now that we've really got one it scares you more than it does the British!
The land here is best for grain and corn.
Though, sometimes we get frost and that can cut the season.
My daughter, I ask only...
This, this is life indeed! Life worth preserving, Such life as Juba never felt till now.
For God sake, get that horrid stuff off your face. You look like a damned slave! It's damned humiliating.
Juba was a Numidian.

He was not black! He was... tan! Weathered!

Hey, you want La Tierra Rent-A-Car just over there, but I think all they got are Rabbit convertibles.
Shit, now someone's gotta climb down there and get him.

His foot. Jeez, poor Ronnie...

Yeah, I'm really gonna miss him.
Listen, tonight, later on, I got one for you doesn't involve any heavy work. I want you to go have a look around Chili Palmer's hotel room.
I can't. I got to take Farrah to Satan's place down in Costa Mesa.
I can't. I got to take Farrah to Satan's place down in Costa Mesa.

Bear. The Colombians are in L.A. Seems they all upset about their money. That ain't enough, as a bonus, it turns out the yoyo was Escobar's nephew.

That's your problem. You shouldn't've smoked the guy.
He's gonna plea-deal his way out. Give up this ace stunt man now one of the West Coast dope kings, if they go easy on the Cat.
Come here, Farrah...
I heard in the Federal joints they let you spend an extra five minutes at the glass with your Daddy on Father's Day.
Farrah. Come here.
After this one, I'm out, Cat, you understand? This is the last time we talk to each other.

I was thinking tonight you could go have a look around Palmer's hotel room while I go check out Karen Flores' place. See if he hasn't stashed it somewhere.
I was thinking tonight you could go have a look around Palmer's hotel room while I go check out Karen Flores' place. See if he hasn't stashed it somewhere.
And if we don't happen to find it under Palmer's mattress or inside Karen Flores' undie drawer? What then?
And if we don't happen to find it under Palmer's mattress or inside Karen Flores' undie drawer? What then?

Hell, why not just shoot her? Why not shoot everybody. Fuckin' shoot me. Shoot the fuckin' president?
Don't fade on me now, Bear. Not unless you wanna hold Farrah on your lap in a room fulla felons.
And that's for the airport.

Hey, he should have a weapon, a knife or something.
We'll get it later.
You keep hittin' him like that, he ain't gonna look like he broke in anymore, he gonna look like someone beat him up and then shot him.

Look, there's no fuckin' way I'm gonna give you the key, outside of you point a gun at my head. Then we might have something to talk about. Now step away from the car.
I don't need a gun. Where is it? If it isn't on you, it's around here someplace.
What're you hanging around with a guy like that for? You were in the movies, right? A stuntman? What's he ever done he can talk about? You feel okay?
Not too bad.

Sure. Family. I know how that goes.
Sure. Family. I know how that goes.
He comes up here with our product. He suppose to come home with five hundred thousand dollars. He never shows up. Meanwhile, my sister's going crazy calling me all the time worried about him. Me, I just wanna know what happened to my focking money.

You know, you speak very good English, Mr. Escobar.
I went to UC San Diego. We're gonna spend the weekend at the Universal Sheraton. We're gonna take the tour. See the shark. Check out the Miami Vice Action Spectacular. After, we'll come here, get our money.
What's this movie you're doing first?
Harry, let me answer that.
But first I want to know who I'm talking to. Am I talking to you, or am I talking to him?
You can talk to me.
You can talk to me.
That's what I thought. So let me put it this way...
You understand I knew Harry was lying, saying this wasn't any good, but holding on to it, man, like you have to break his fingers to get it from him.
That's funny, I was just wondering what I was gonna break of yours to get it away from you.
I'm just explaining to you what I'm doing here. Case you think I come to rob the place, rip off any of this dusty old shit the man has.
I'd never make you as a burglar, not in that outfit.
Harry called you his associate, but what does that mean? I never heard your name or read it in Variety or The Reporter or anyplace.
It's what he said, I'm his associate.
It's what he said, I'm his associate.
You must bring something heavy to the deal.
You must bring something heavy to the deal.
That's right, me.

Yeah, we're getting Martin.
Yeah, we're getting Martin.
No shit, come on. How you gonna do that?

I put a gun right here... ...and I tell him, 'Sign the paper Marty or your fuckin' dead.' Like that.
I put a gun right here... ...and I tell him, 'Sign the paper Marty or your fuckin' dead.' Like that.

I missed that one. Or, hey, you know who else? Morgan Freeman. You know Morgan?
Yeah, Morgan Freeman. But he's a colored guy.
Yeah, Morgan Freeman. But he's a colored guy.
So what? Where's it say in this script he's white? Color is what the part needs, man, somebody to do it has some style. The way it is now, Ronnie could do it, play himself, some cracked out asshole. So whatta you think of the script?
Title's the first thing's got to go. And the guy's name. I mean, even this writer's name, Murray Saffrin is better than "Lovejoy".
I'm with you on that. And don't you think it needs a good female part? Increase the romance angle.
There's Ilona.
What about her?
What about her?
Get something going there.
Get something going there.
With Ilona? You know how old Ilona is?
With Ilona? You know how old Ilona is?

Yeah, I read it. I was just thinking you could make her older. We might even be able to get Karen Flores.
Who?
Who?
She's been out of movies a few years, but she's good. Real good.
You know how to write one of these?
There's nothin' to know. You have an idea, you write down what you wanna say. Then you get somebody to add in the commas and shit where they belong, if you aren't positive yourself. Maybe fix up the spelling where you have some tricky words... although I've seen scripts where I know words weren't spelled right and there was hardly any commas in it

Yeah, I was wondering why he should do that.
Listen, Harry, how would you like to get your hands on five hundred grand? You pay me back at your convenience, no interest.
You serious?
You serious?
All I want in return is to work on the movie with you. Fact I already got some ideas on how to fix it up.
How 'bout another one for Mr. Zimm. A double.
You're gonna just give me five hundred grand?
You're gonna just give me five hundred grand?
We'll talk about that, Harry. But first I gotta know, how'd you hook up with Chili Palmer.
He was watching Letterman, huh? Sneaky, that Chili Palmer. So, he ever find this dry cleaner, the one with all that money on him?
Leo, I don't know.
Assuming I go along with this, when can I have the five hundred?
Whenever you want it. The money's in hundred dollar bills inside one of those jock bags, you know? In a locker at the airport, waiting to be picked up.

What I been wondering is where's he been.
Yeah, where've you been? We haven't heard from you lately.
Okay. Then be good enough to hand us our money back, or you think about us coming in on this new one.
By Friday, man, or you're fuckin' dead as disco.
You get to town, you go straight to the bank, raid the limo account.
I'm already in town, but it don't matter. We got dick in the bank. We dumped it all in Harry's movie.

Maybe that's because you've never been out've fuckin' Miami, dipshit. Maybe it's time you got on a plane, flew out to L.A. and took a meeting with Mr. Zimm.
So, what, this Zimm guy asking for some kinda finders fee, that what we're talking about here?

You took a swing at me over some fuckin' thing, whatever it was - forget it. You owe me some money, right? Forget that too. But, you don't say a fuckin' word about this to anybody.

Anyway, you want this guy, he's in L.A. We put him on a flight after he spanked one a my cocktail girls in the Keno room.
Leo spanked a waitress?
Leo spanked a waitress?
Apparently, way it went, he invited her to come to Santa Anita to play the ponies with him. She told him what to do with that and he gave her one on the tush. My guess, he's by his lonesome at the track right now.
Hey, Chil? Since you're goin' out to L.A. anyway.
What've you got?
What've you got?
Guy owes us a hundred and fifty grand, sixty days over; a movie producer.
Guy owes us a hundred and fifty grand, sixty days over; a movie producer.
Movie producer? Yeah, why not.
Jesus, if I have a heart attack, I hope you know what to do.
Where you been, Harry?
Have we met? I don't recall.
We just did. I told you my name's Chili Palmer.
Did you stop to think what if I had a heart attack?
You look okay to me, Harry. Come over here and sit down. Tell me what you been up to.
I'm looking at you.
I want you to keep looking right here, okay?
I want you to keep looking right here, okay?
That's what I'm doing.
That's what I'm doing.
You know Dick Allen, Mesa's Casino?
You know Dick Allen, Mesa's Casino?
Dick Allen's a very dear friend of mine. How far you want to go with this?
Dick Allen's a very dear friend of mine. How far you want to go with this?
We're there, Harry. You signed markers for a hundred and a half, you're over sixty days past due and you haven't told anybody what the problem is.
Operator, how do I get Las Vegas Information?
Harry, lemme give you some advice.
A marker's like a check, Harry.
I know what a marker is.
I know what a marker is.
They don't want to deposit yours and have it bounce. That annoys them. So your dear friend Dick Allen's been calling, leaving messages on your machine, but you never get back to him. I happen to be in Vegas on another matter, and Dick asks me as a favor would I look you up. I follow you over here, see you in the window
You're not looking at me, Harry.
Why do I have to keep looking at you?
Why do I have to keep looking at you?
I want you to.
I want you to.
You gonna get rough now, threaten me? I make good by tomorrow or get my legs broken?
You gonna get rough now, threaten me? I make good by tomorrow or get my legs broken?
Come on, Harry - Mesas? The worst they might do is get a judgment against you, uttering a bad check. I can't imagine you want that to happen, man in your position.
Come on, Harry - Mesas? The worst they might do is get a judgment against you, uttering a bad check. I can't imagine you want that to happen, man in your position.
Fuckin' basketball game.
You make movies, huh?
I produce feature motion pictures, no TV. You mentioned Grotesque, that happened to be Grotesque Part II that Karen Flores was in. She starred in all three of my Slime Creatures releases you might have seen.
Karen, say hello to Chili Palmer. Chili, this is Karen Flores.
Karen, it's a pleasure. How you doing?
You want to hear this idea? It's about a dry cleaner who scams an airline out of three hundred grand. Go on, tell her.
You just did.
You just did.
I mean, the way you told it to me. Start at the beginning, we see how the story line develops.
It's the kind of situation, you don't pay, you get your legs broken.
Or the guy thinks he could get 'em broken. You have to understand the loan shark's in business the same as anybody else. He isn't in it to hurt people. He's in it to make money.
Without him. The guy's so out of it he doesn't even know it's gone.
That's right. As a matter of fact...
Keep going.
Well, since Leo's name was on the passenger list...
So he comes to L.A...
I don't know about his wanting to meet celebrities, that's something new. But, yeah, he comes to L.A. Then after that, I don't know what happens.
That's it? That's your movie?
I said I had an idea, that's all.
I said I had an idea, that's all.
That's half a movie, with holes in it. Maybe forty minutes of screen time. You don't even have a girl, a female lead, and on top of that, there's no one to sympathize with, you don't have a good guy.
That's half a movie, with holes in it. Maybe forty minutes of screen time. You don't even have a girl, a female lead, and on top of that, there's no one to sympathize with, you don't have a good guy.
The shylock's the good guy.
The shylock's the good guy.
The shylock? He's barely mentioned. And it's not believable the wife would get a settlement that fast.
Part of it, yeah.
Wait a minute, you're not the guy, are you? The dry cleaner?
Wait a minute, you're not the guy, are you? The dry cleaner?
You mean, Leo?
You mean, Leo?
You wouldn't be talking to me if you were.
You wouldn't be talking to me if you were.
I'm not the guy, Harry.
I'm not the guy, Harry.
But you work for the casino?
But you work for the casino?
I'm out here looking for Leo. I just looked you up as a favor to your dear friend, Dick Allen.
I'm out here looking for Leo. I just looked you up as a favor to your dear friend, Dick Allen.
So you don't work for the casino?
Is that right, that's what you do for a living?
What I did till recently. After I get done here I'll think about what I'm gonna do next.
I imagine in your line of work, there were times you had to get rough, you know, say one of your customers stopped paying.
They always paid.
You pack a gun?
Not really.
Not really.
What does that mean?
What does that mean?
Maybe a few times I have.

Ever shot anybody.

Once.

Really? You ever been arrested?

I've been picked up a couple times. Loan sharking. Racketeering. But I was never convicted. I'm clean.
I've been picked up a couple times. Loan sharking. Racketeering. But I was never convicted. I'm clean.
Racketeering, that covers a lot of ground, doesn't it?
These guys, my investors, they run a limo service, came to me originally, put money in a few of my pictures and did okay, they're happy. So they come in on another deal - this was back a few months ago when I was planning what would be my next picture, about this band of killer circus freaks that travel around the country leaving
Harry, look at me.
You're trying to tell me how you fucked up without sounding stupid, and that's hard to do. Let's just get to where you're at, okay? You blew the two hundred grand the limo guys gave you in Vegas on a basketball game and you haven't told 'em about it. Why not?
Because they're not the type of guys would take it with any degree of understanding or restraint. The first thing they'd do is break my legs.
Because they're not the type of guys would take it with any degree of understanding or restraint. The first thing they'd do is break my legs.
You got that on the brain, Harry. If you're so scared of 'em why'd you take their money to Vegas to begin with?
You got that on the brain, Harry. If you're so scared of 'em why'd you take their money to Vegas to begin with?
Because I need half a million to buy a script.

A blockbuster. But quality. No mutants or maniacs. This one's gonna be my "Driving Miss Daisy".

What's it called?

"Mr. Lovejoy".
"Mr. Lovejoy".
"Mr. Lovejoy"? That's the title?
"Mr. Lovejoy"? That's the title?
It's not bad when you know what it's about.
Murray Saffrin, guy who wrote it, did all my Grotesque pictures, had it in a drawer for twenty years. He shows it to me one day, tells me he's got a star interested, would I produce it.
Who's the star?
Two time academy award nominee, Martin Weir.
Martin Weir. He played the mob guy that turned snitch in "The Cyclone".

One of his best parts.

No, his best part was the cripple gay guy that climbed Mt. Whitney.

"Ride the Clouds". Good picture.
She looks familiar.
She's a rock star. Every day, same time, they come down here and have breakfast. He has the egg white omelet; she has the banana pancakes. He sits facing west so he can see his billboard. She faces east so she has an excuse to wear the shades.
Anyway, Murray has this shrink, who also happens to be Martin's personal trainer's shrink. Murray gives the shrink the script and the shrink gives it to Martin's trainer who reads it to Martin while they work out, and Martin flips. Loves it.
So what's the problem?
So what's the problem?
The problem is Murray. He and a few other blocked screenwriters went river rafting down the Kern a few weeks ago. Murray never made it back.

He drown?
He drown?
Heart attack. Apparently they brought a couple hookers along.
Doris, Murray's widow, finds out about this Martin Weir thing and says since Murray and I never had any written contract, she wants five hundred grand for the script.
So you're thinking what if I was to put you next to my dry cleaner. Ask him if he wants to invest his money in a movie.

I'm not gonna pop her, Harry.
I'm not gonna pop her, Harry.
Just a thought.
Just a thought.
But I could talk to the limo guys. Tell 'em to leave you alone for a while. Make the point in a way they'd understand it.
But I could talk to the limo guys. Tell 'em to leave you alone for a while. Make the point in a way they'd understand it.
You don't even know these guys.

Harry, I probably know 'em better than you do.
Harry, I probably know 'em better than you do.
What do you get out of this?
What do you get out of this?
Let's see how we get along.
Lovejoy sits behind the wheel, watching the bar across the street, getting his video camera ready for action... What's he doing? Following a guy?
Read it. It's a grabber.
No leave 'em up, we want the light in their eyes. I'll be at the desk... but don't introduce me, let it go, just start talking. You're gonna be here, behind 'em when they sit down.
They'll be looking at you. They don't know who you are.
They'll be looking at you. They don't know who you are.
That's right, they're wondering, who's this guy? You don't tell 'em. Understand, Harry? Do not tell 'em who I am.
You don't say any more'n you have to. You say, 'Well, I'm glad you assholes stopped by, so I can set you straight.'
You're kidding, right?
What?
I don't know, maybe I wasn't clear. But I thought... I told you to keep your mouth shut.
I don't know, maybe I wasn't clear. But I thought... I told you to keep your mouth shut.
I had to tell 'em something.
I had to tell 'em something.
Never say anything unless you have to.
You tell me you want these guys off your back. Next thing I know, you're saying yeah, maybe they can have a piece of Mr. Lovejoy. I couldn't believe my fuckin' ears.
I said I'd think about it. What does that mean? In this town, nothing.
I said I'd think about it. What does that mean? In this town, nothing.
That's the difference between you and me, Harry. I say what I mean. I want something from someone, I ask 'em straight out. I want Martin Weir, I go get Martin Weir. I don't fuck around with his trainer's shrink.
That's the difference between you and me, Harry. I say what I mean. I want something from someone, I ask 'em straight out. I want Martin Weir, I go get Martin Weir. I don't fuck around with his trainer's shrink.
His shrink's trainer.
How's anyone gonna see anything from way up there?
Hey, Harry.
Hey, Harry.
Yeah, Chili. Hi. You're fifty feet in the air!
Here's your keys, Harry.
Get the fuck outta my chair.
Is he giving you a check or cash?
Cash. It happens to be waiting right at this moment in a locker at the airport.
Okay, Harry, I'm wrong. You're not the one he's setting up.
I mean, at least Bo's invested in three of my movies.
Really.
Yeah, he wants us to talk to Buddy, set up a meeting.
Yeah, he wants us to talk to Buddy, set up a meeting.
A meeting with who? You and Karen?
So how 'bout it, Mr. Selznick, do I make my deal with Bo? Or you gonna finally help me out, have a word with your dry cleaner when you find him.
I found him.
Forget about Leo's money, Harry.
You have it?
You have it?
Harry, if I gave you Leo's money you'd have Ray Bones all over your ass and then you'd be in a whole new kinda trouble.
Harry, if I gave you Leo's money you'd have Ray Bones all over your ass and then you'd be in a whole new kinda trouble.

Who the fuck is Momo? Jesus, these fucking names...
Who the fuck is Momo? Jesus, these fucking names...
Tell you what, Harry, tomorrow morning, when the airport's crowded, I'll go check it out. If I don't see a problem, I'll pick up the money...
Maybe I oughta talk to this Ray Bones character myself. See if he wants to invest in my movie.
Don't waste your time, Harry. The guy's not much of a movie fan. Now c'mon, gimme the key.
You cut straight hair in this place, or just fags?
Hey, Bones, looks like you're gonna have a nice scar up there. Maybe these guys can fit you with a rug, cover it up for ya.
You got a miss. Leo Devoe. Guy's six weeks over.
He died.
He died.
How'd you know he died, he tell you?
Yeah, he told me.
Personally?

Yeah, Ray, he personally told me he got killed in that Get Away Airlines' jet went down last month.

Yeah, well, maybe the guy took out flight insurance. Check with the wife.
Hey, it's your book now. You want to check it out, go ahead. He's got a dry cleaning business out on Federal Highway.
Which also means when I speak, I'm speakin' for Jimmy. So e.g. as of now, you start affording me the proper respect.
'E.g.' means 'for example', Ray. I think what you wanna say is 'i.e.'
'E.g.' means 'for example', Ray. I think what you wanna say is 'i.e.'
Bullshit. E.g. is short for 'ergo'.
Bullshit. E.g. is short for 'ergo'.
Ask your man here.
You owe me the dry cleaner's fifteen grand plus the juice which is what another, uhh...
Twenty seven hundred.
Twenty seven hundred.
Exactly. You either get it from the wife or out of your own pocket, I don't give a fuck. You don't ever hand me a book with a miss in it.
Yeah. That was a good party.
You know, Marty, you were good in The Cyclone.
You know, Marty, you were good in The Cyclone.
Martin. It was a beautiful role. All I had to do was find the character's center, the stem I'd used to wind him up and he'd play, man, he'd play.
Well, you had it down cold. Watching you in the movie, if I didn't know better I'd have to believe you were a made guy and not acting. Even the fink part. I never met a fink and I hope to God I never do, but how you did it must be the way finks act.
A few weeks before shooting, I went back to Bensonhurst, just to listen to you guys. See, I'm Italian, but I grew up in Tarzana. So I wanted to pick up your rhythms of speech.
A few weeks before shooting, I went back to Bensonhurst, just to listen to you guys. See, I'm Italian, but I grew up in Tarzana. So I wanted to pick up your rhythms of speech.
We talk different?
We talk different?
It's more like your attitude. Your tone, your speech patterns demonstrate a certain confidence in yourselves, in your opinions, your indifference to conventional views.

You mean like we don't give a shit.
You mean like we don't give a shit.
Yeah. Kinda. Anyway, once I have the authentic sounds of speech, the rhythms, man, the patois, I can actually begin to think the way those guys do, get inside their heads.
So you don't know what I'm thinking.
No, I don't. Though I have to say I'm curious.
No, I don't. Though I have to say I'm curious.
So you want to know.

If you'd like to tell me, yeah.

I'm thinking of a movie.

One of mine?

One we're producing.

With what? Wiseguy money?
Martin, I'm not connected to those people anymore. Not since I walked out of a loanshark Operation in Miami.
What happened? The pressure got to you?
What happened? The pressure got to you?
Pressure? I'm the one applied the pressure.
Guy owes me fifteen large and takes off, I go after him. The fuck you think I do?
Martin, look at me.
Martin, look at me.
I'm looking at you.
No, I want you to look at me the way I'm looking at you. Put it in your eyes, 'You're mine, asshole,' without saying it.
Like this?
Like this?
What you're telling me, you're tired? You wanna go to bed?
What you're telling me, you're tired? You wanna go to bed?
Wait. How about this?

That's what I think of you, asshole. Nothing.

I believe it.

I turn it on when I confront the guy.
I turn it on when I confront the guy.
Yeah, but you haven't found him yet. The guy took off for Las Vegas.
Yeah, but you haven't found him yet. The guy took off for Las Vegas.
How do I know that?
The wife sues the airline. This is a gutsy babe.
Good-looking, too. Like Karen.
So when do I meet up with the husband and give him the look?
It's not that simple. You have to be careful. There's another guy that comes along, a hard-on you owe some money to. A mob guy. Wants to take you out anyway, on account of a past situation.
It's not that simple. You have to be careful. There's another guy that comes along, a hard-on you owe some money to. A mob guy. Wants to take you out anyway, on account of a past situation.
Okay. I'm listening.
At that point, basically, that has to be it.
You're not going to tell me the rest?
Lemme talk to Buddy, set up a meeting.
Buddy?
Very nice...
Yeah, I like it, I'm high up, I can see everything, you know? It's the Cadillac of minivans.
Yeah, I like it, I'm high up, I can see everything, you know? It's the Cadillac of minivans.
What's that?
What's that?
Compass.
Compass.
Wow. Mind if I take it for a spin?
Whatta you think, Chill?
That's not bad. I think you got it down.
I wouldn't think you're that dumb, leave over three hundred grand in the closet, underneath the extra blanket, but I guess you are.
I didn't know where else to keep it. Where would you?
I didn't know where else to keep it. Where would you?
You're here a while, what's wrong with a bank?
You're here a while, what's wrong with a bank?
They report it to the IRS.

You don't open an account, Leo, you put it in a safe deposit box. Dip in whenever you want.
You've been losing.
I'm up twelve grand today.

How'd you know I was here?
How'd you know I was here?
Here's another tip...
It was Fay, wasn't it, told you about the money. She tell you my whole life history, for Christ's sake?
I wouldn't let her if she tried. Why I'm here, Leo, basically, is to save your ass.
I wouldn't let her if she tried. Why I'm here, Leo, basically, is to save your ass.
How? By taking my money?

You can keep what you won today. That's yours.
You can keep what you won today. That's yours.
It's all mine.
It's all mine.
Sit down, Leo.
You take all my money, but you're borrowing part of it?
At eighteen percent, okay? And don't ask me no more fuckin' questions. I'm leaving.
But you won't know where I am. I don't even know where I'll be.
I'll find you, Leo...
It's not one of these?
You see a black leather jacket, fingertip length, like the one Pacino wore in Serpico? You don't, you owe me three seventy-nine.

Maybe you don't see my sign?
We call you a taxi.
Lemme get this straight. You aren't responsible for any lost articles like an expensive coat of mine, but you're gonna find Ray Bones' coat or get him a new one? Is that what you're telling me?

You broke in?

No, it was open. It wasn't locked.
No, it was open. It wasn't locked.
What if it was?
Well, basically, this guy owes a shylock fifteen thousand, plus he's a few weeks behind on the vig, the interest you have to pay.
I know what a vig is.
The interest is four hundred and fifty dollars a week on fifteen thousand?
That's right. Three percent.
That's right. Three percent.
But a week. That's a hundred and fifty percent a year.
But a week. That's a hundred and fifty percent a year.

A real bargain.
A couple days ago by, people from the airliner come to see his wife, tell her how sorry they are and all that their plane exploded and offer her a settlement, the amount based on what he would've earned operating the dry cleaner's the rest of his life. Leo had some kind of trouble with his kidneys, so they were giving him about ten
How much is the wife offered?
Hey... Karen. How ya' doin'?
What're you doing here?
What're you doing here?
I wanted to come by, apologize for coming into your house like I did last night.

Like in "Bride of the Mutant", when you played the whole end with that torn top.
You saw that one?
Yeah. When you turn to the camera to tell the alien mother that her time on earth is finished... when you give us all that look, Joan Crawford wishes on her best day she had that much presence. Not even in "Mildred Pierce" - which by the way was a better book than a movie - did Crawford even touch the intensity you had

Yeah... that was a good scene. I mean, for a horror movie.
Yeah... that was a good scene. I mean, for a horror movie.
For any movie.

I know I'm better than what I've been doing the last ten years, walking around in a tank top and fuck-me pumps, waiting till it's time to scream.
I know I'm better than what I've been doing the last ten years, walking around in a tank top and fuck-me pumps, waiting till it's time to scream.
Man, can you scream.
Man, can you scream.
Yeah. It's a real gift. I'm just saying it'd be nice, one time in my career to get the chance to say one great line. You know, like in that Bette Davis picture, "Cabin in the..."
Yeah. It's a real gift. I'm just saying it'd be nice, one time in my career to get the chance to say one great line. You know, like in that Bette Davis picture, "Cabin in the..."
"Cotton".
"Cotton".
Yeah, you know when Bette comes up to the guy on the porch, gives him a flirty look and says, 'I'd kiss you, but...'
How come you stopped making movies with Harry?
I married Martin. That was a full- time job.

That why Harry came over last night? See if you could help him get Martin in his movie?

Don't go out of your way.
Well, I gotta have a talk with Leo, my runaway dry cleaner.
Right. See how your story ends.
Right. See how your story ends.
Yeah. Right. Listen, "Touch of Evil"'s playing near my hotel. You wanna go check it out? Watch Charlton Heston play a Mexican?
You been here the whole time?
I just caught the end.
I got you a copy of the script.
I already read it. Harry left a copy at the house.
I already read it. Harry left a copy at the house.
What do you think?
I think it's not horrible.
I don't like the title. Or the main guy's name.
I don't like the title. Or the main guy's name.
Then you've read it?
Then you've read it?
Not yet.
Not yet.
You and Harry'll make a great team. I'm gonna make a deal with him.
You and Harry'll make a great team. I'm gonna make a deal with him.
There a part in it for you?
There a part in it for you?
I don't want to act in it, I want to produce it with Harry. Especially if I help him get Martin.
I don't want to act in it, I want to produce it with Harry. Especially if I help him get Martin.
Sounds fair.
Sounds fair.
What do you get out of it?
That why you came over here, to ask me that?
I want to know.
I want to know.
Why does anyone want to be in movies?
Why does anyone want to be in movies?
Yesterday, you were a loan shark.
I was never much into it. All that bullshit having to do with respect. It's bad enough having to treat those guys like they're your heroes, having to smile when they make some stupid remark they think's real funny.
And you think the movie business is any different?
And you think the movie business is any different?
Yeah well... I like movies. I figure if I help Harry make one, I'll find out what you have to do outside of have an idea and raise the money. That doesn't sound too hard. I was in the money business and I get ideas all the time.
This thing's actually accurate. I bought it for ten bucks from a kid in a lawn chair on Sunset...
You were supposed to wait for me with Harry at the restaurant.
Well actually, Martin the movie we came to talk about is Mr. Lovejoy.
Yeah. We understand you read the script and like it... a lot.
A locker at the airport? Jesus Christ, Harry. Tell me you're not really that stupid.
The guy's setting you up. You pulled out of their Freaks deal so he's paying you back.
That was Martin. He wants to have lunch tomorrow. That is, if you can make it.
Depends, who pays?
Depends, who pays?
Definitely not Martin. Movie stars never pick up the check. They have no idea what things cost. Most of them don't know their zip code and a lot don't even know their own phone number.
How'd you meet Martin anyway?
Not unlike the way Nicki met him. Except it was a wrap party. Why?
Not unlike the way Nicki met him. Except it was a wrap party. Why?
I don't know, I'm just havin' some trouble seeing you two together.
I don't know, I'm just havin' some trouble seeing you two together.
You don't like Martin much, do you?
You don't like Martin much, do you?
Oh, I like him. I just think he's... short. I mean, he's a good actor and all, but I'm wondering what it was exactly you saw in Marty.
Oh, I like him. I just think he's... short. I mean, he's a good actor and all, but I'm wondering what it was exactly you saw in Marty.
For starters, Marty wasn't Martin back then.
So what about your story. You thought of a title yet?
How 'bout Get Shorty? Except that isn't a movie. That's real life.
How 'bout Get Shorty? Except that isn't a movie. That's real life.
How 'bout Chili's Hollywood Adventure.
How 'bout Chili's Hollywood Adventure.
That's a different story. I'm still working on that one, you know, getting the visual fabric just right. Although I've added to it.
Yeah?
Yeah. There's a girl in it now.
Yeah. There's a girl in it now.
Really.
I think you could be an actor. I know you're acting sometimes, but you don't show it.
You thought I was faking?
You thought I was faking?
No. I don't mean that. I just meant in general.
No. I don't mean that. I just meant in general.
Oh.
You don't mean a movie star? More like a character actor?
Whichever. Let's talk about it tomorrow.
I mean I could see myself in movies Robert De Niro had been in. Or I could maybe do an Al Pacino movie, play a hard-on. But I couldn't see myself in ones, like say the one where the three guys get stuck with a baby. They don't know how to take care of it and you see these big grown-up assholes acting cute
Hey, Chili? Look at me.
Harry... My God...
What happened?
What kinda food they serve at this Ivy place anyway?
Continental, but it doesn't matter. Martin won't order from the menu.
Why not?
Because a movie star can never order straight from the menu. They have to think of something they have to have that isn't on the menu.
Harry, what're you doing? You're supposed to be in the hospital.
Yeah, Harry, you look like you belong in one of your horror movies.
You sure?
He's doing the same thing you did to him, playing Letterman on TV.
He's doing the same thing you did to him, playing Letterman on TV.
It's not Dave. It's a movie.
It's not Dave. It's a movie.
Are you going down?
Are you going down?
I don't know.
I don't know.
You're as bad as Harry...
You're as bad as Harry...
I'll go. I'll go.
You okay?
Guy's got a fucking pink toilet, for Christ's sake.
Karen! What the fuck are you doing?!
Oh, shit... I'm sorry... I thought that was... I'm so sorry...
Were you scared up there?
You bet.
You bet.
You don't act like it?
You don't act like it?
I was scared then, not now. How long you want me to be scared?
I'll be right back.
Go get your stuff.
What took you so long?
Couldn't find my toothbrush.
They're closing the Granview. You know, theater down on Biscayne?
Yeah, the guy owes Momo a few G's.
Yeah, the guy owes Momo a few G's.
What I'm thinkin' is maybe Momo could buy it.
Momo could buy it, I could run it for him. Show some Cagney films.
What's Momo gonna want with an old place, shows old movies people don't care about no more. Outside of maybe turnin' it into a porno house, I don't think he's gonna give much of a fuck. And you already got a job.
You sure it was Ray Bones took the coat?
That's what the guy said.
That's what the guy said.
Tomorrow, I see on the TV weather, it's gonna be nice and warm. You won't need the coat.
Hey, Chili. Get your coat, but don't piss the guy off, okay? It could get complicated and we'd have to call Momo to straighten it out. Then Momo gets pissed for wasting his time and we don't need that.
Don't worry about it. I won't say any more than I have to, if that.
No, I said I'm never goin' to bed. There's a difference. See, the article says most people die in their beds. I figure long as I stay outta bed, I'm safe.
That's the dumbest thing I ever heard. Where do you sleep?
That's the dumbest thing I ever heard. Where do you sleep?
In an armchair. Or I go to a coffee shop, sleep there. Sit in a booth, pull my hat down.
I told you not to -
Don't say a fuckin' word.
I hate to say I told you, but I did. I told you don't start nothing with him that time.
You said don't say nothing and I didn't.
You said don't say nothing and I didn't.
No, you just broke his fuckin' nose instead.
No, you just broke his fuckin' nose instead.
You gonna start that again? You're just like him, all you got room for in your brain is one fuckin' thing.
You gonna start that again? You're just like him, all you got room for in your brain is one fuckin' thing.
All I know is he came by the barber shop, all fuckin' undone, wanting to know where you were staying in Vegas. I told him I don't know. I still don't.

How'd he know I was in Vegas? You tell him?

He already knew it.
He already knew it.
Yeah, well, I'm in L.A. now.
Yeah, well, I'm in L.A. now.
Whatta you doing out there?
Whatta you doing out there?
I'm going into the movie business.
I'm going into the movie business.
What're you talking about? You wanna be a movie star?

I'm thinking about producing.
I'm thinking about producing.
How you gonna do that? You don't know shit about making movies.

I don't think the producer has to do much, outside of maybe knowing a writer.
I don't think the producer has to do much, outside of maybe knowing a writer.
Hey, Chil? I think you're fulla shit.
Yeah, but whose point of view?
Whatta you mean, whose point of view; The audience's point of view.
Whatta you mean, whose point of view; The audience's point of view.
Get down here. I wanna talk to you. Come on... right now... She's gonna talk to Martin?
All these camera moves and weird angles and shit are gonna distance us from the emotion of the scene.
What 'emotion'? Girl just got stabbed in the ear with an ice pick.
What 'emotion'? Girl just got stabbed in the ear with an ice pick.
She's scared! Fear is an emotion! Look, kid, if you remember anything from your time working with Harry Zimm, let it be the three key words to filmmaking.
Yeah? What three words, Harry?
Pick 'n' Save.
Pick 'n' Save.
Hm?
Hm?
You heard me, Pick 'n' Save.
So Mildred says to the cashier, 'I saw the new Streisand picture.' 'God, I just love it at the end when she brushed Robert Redford's hair off his forehead the way she did when they were together, and the way they gave each other this look that said they still loved each other, but knew they couldn't be together. That look was so... romantic.'
That's great, Harry. So what's the --
That's great, Harry. So what's the --
What she did not say was, 'I just loved the way the director moved the camera so much it made me fuckin' seasick.' All she cared about was that look. All she remembered was that look. And why do we remember things in movies? Because we can see them.
Hello, Doris.
Harry Zimm. You look like a wet kiss.
Well, aren't you gonna offer me whatever it is you taste like?
Come on in.
What a spectacular view.
Yeah, lovely. Last night I watched two guys carjack a Camaro down on the corner of Argyle there. What do you want, Doris?
I miss Murray, Harry.
Yeah, me too. He was a helluva good writer. And I would know. I discovered him. Made him what he was.
Yeah, me too. He was a helluva good writer. And I would know. I discovered him. Made him what he was.
What he was, was a hack, couldn't get a job writing for anybody but you. I'm being honest. He was a lousy writer, but he was a good husband. I just didn't know it until too late.
I'm not sure how I feel about this, Doris.
You seem to feel fine about it.
You seem to feel fine about it.
I mean morally. Murray was my friend.
I mean morally. Murray was my friend.
Murray's dead.
So this means you've reconsidered our deal on Mr. Lovejoy?
No. But now that you mention it, I did talk to a handsome executive at Paramount the other day... who just happened to get his hands on the script.
No. But now that you mention it, I did talk to a handsome executive at Paramount the other day... who just happened to get his hands on the script.
Yeah, what'd he have to say?
Yeah, what'd he have to say?
He said if Martin's interested, I could get a half a million for it easy. But don't worry, Harry, I'm still giving you until Friday.
He said if Martin's interested, I could get a half a million for it easy. But don't worry, Harry, I'm still giving you until Friday.
How honorable of you.
What's wrong?
Be quiet and listen.
Be quiet and listen.
I don't hear anything.
When I came upstairs, you stayed to finish your drink. I told you to turn off the TV when you were through. Come to think of it, I also told you you could sleep in the maid's room.
Yeah, well I turned off the set. I used the remote control thing and laid it on the floor. You know what could've happened? The dog came in and stepped on it, turned the TV back on.
Yeah, well I turned off the set. I used the remote control thing and laid it on the floor. You know what could've happened? The dog came in and stepped on it, turned the TV back on.
I don't have a dog.
I don't have a dog.
You don't? What happened to Muff?
You don't? What happened to Muff?
Harry, are you going down, or you want me to?
Anyone skim the pool? It needs it.
Harry -
Harry -
I'm going.
How did you get in the house?
He's telling me an idea for a movie. It's not bad so far. Sit down, have a drink. Tell Karen, let's see what she thinks.
He's telling me an idea for a movie. It's not bad so far. Sit down, have a drink. Tell Karen, let's see what she thinks.
Maybe you didn't hear me.
That Miami flight that went down, it was on the news every day for about a week. Harry must've been busy.
That's where you got the idea?
With your experience, you could always become an agent. Right, Harry?
Yeah, that's what we need. More agents.
Yeah, that's what we need. More agents.
Well. I got an audition tomorrow.
Well. I got an audition tomorrow.
No problem. You go on off to bed.
What I'm saying, Harry, is I want you and your new buddy to get out of my house.
Oh, yeah, sure.
Harry, what're you still doing with those guys?
He happens to be loaning me five hundred grand, no strings, I write any kind of agreement I want.
Harry, we spoke with Martin.
'We?'
'We?'
Chili and me.
Harry -
Man's in town two days, thinks he's David O. fucking Selznick.
Which two?
Once their lives are in danger and you have the mob guy coming after them, it not only heightens the tension, it adds a wistful element to their love.

Mob guy?
I have to run. But what I hope to see, they begin to have misgivings about wanting the money. It becomes their moral dilemma and they try to rationalize keeping it, but in the end they can't. Can they?
What money?
What money?
The three hundred large. What other money is there? I should keep quiet, I know, till I've read the script, but I've got a feeling about this one. I'm that shylock.

Shylock?
Karen. Wow. Look at you...
Hello, Martin.
I'm sitting here, I'm looking at you and I'm having these flashes. You know, flashbacks, of memories. Of us.
Really.
Really.
Yeah and I'm wondering, how did it go wrong? How did it all... slip away?
Yeah and I'm wondering, how did it go wrong? How did it all... slip away?
'It' didn't slip away, Martin, you did... when you went off to fuck Nicki in the middle of my birthday party.
Oh, for Christ's sake -
I know. I'm doing Shylock instead of a shylock. Okay, what's my motivation? The acquisition of money. To collect. Inflict pain if I have to.
Lufkin. His... agent.
Yeah, Karen knows him.
Yeah, Karen knows him.
But you are interested?
But you are interested?
I'm intrigued, yeah. You know what might help you, take a look at the Cylone again, the way a visual fabric is maintained even while the metaphor plays on different levels. Hey - This your ride, Chili?
Hi, sweetface. You look great. And mmmmm, you smell good, too.
Thanks.
I have to consider, I mean, as the mob guy, this is another man's wife I'm sleeping with.
And after all, you have such morals.

Hear that, Dodge? Epps don't think it's a problem.
I'll sleep good tonight knowing that.
Looks like Epps' gonna get some tonight.
With that coxswain dickhead.
Hypothetically speaking, what if we get this boat to Sitka and find out somebody wants it back?
They shoulda thought of that when they let her float away.
They shoulda thought of that when they let her float away.
I don't care what, ain't nobody just gonna let us walk away with a ship that size.
You think the extra strain caused it?
Nah. Everything was cool. It's just one of those things.
How about now?
Sixty pounds.
Sixty pounds.
What? You sure?
What? You sure?
That's what it says.
That's what it says.
Lemme see.
Are you crazy? Do you realize we got ourselves a ship? We own a ship, Dodge.
Yeah, a ship that's supposed to have been lost at sea fifty years ago. You don't think that's just a little freaky?
Fucker!
Take it easy, Dodge. It's only a piece of metal.
Take it easy, Dodge. It's only a piece of metal.
Damn mind of it's own.
Damn mind of it's own.
Morning, skipper.
One minute I'm minding my own business, the next thing I know the whole place is burning up. An oxygen tank must've blown on the welder. Started an oil fire.
Looks like it took out the backup genny too.
What's so great about Sweden?
It's a beautiful country. Very clean. Very civilized. And cold.
Yeah, but not as cold as those Swedish girls you only gonna dream about.
We'll see who's dreamin', m'man.
Where's his boat, then? Where's his crew? He ain't gonna be out here by himself, that's for damn sure.
She's so big somebody could come alongside her on the other side and we'd never know it.
Let's not be too hasty.
Yeah. Hell, what difference does it make if we report it now or later? We call this in now, gonna be Coastguard, FBI, who knows who, all over the place.
I need lag bolts, especially one inch standard. And sheet metal. Preferably steel, about a sixteenth of an inch. Aluminium, even tin'll do.
I ain't no mechanic, just so you know.
I ain't no mechanic, just so you know.
You find anything that even looks like a compressor. I don't care what, grab it.
What day is it?
I don't know. Tuesday?
I don't know. Tuesday?
Wrong. It's Friday.
When they find out what it's carrying, they may not be so interested in what's legal.
Maybe you shoulda thought a that before you scuttled our boat.
The turbine blew.
Lemme see, was that before or after the oil fire?
You'd think on a ship this size there'd be something left to eat.
After fifty years there ain't nothin' left but shoe leather.
Where from?
Amidships starboard at the beam. Just under the waterline. I don't think it's a problem.
One more?
Why not.
What is your first name?
What?
What?
It just occurred to me I don't know your first name. All this time and I don't know it.
Maureen.
What?
What?
Maureen.
Maureen.
Maureen?
Roger.
Roger?
Roger?
Yeah.
You think that's funny
No.
Probably slipped her moorings, got tangled up in a current.
Out here? What, so a seven hundred foot passenger liner drifted out of Spokane harbor and nobody managed to bump into her until now?
Out here? What, so a seven hundred foot passenger liner drifted out of Spokane harbor and nobody managed to bump into her until now?
Somebody's probably looking for her as we speak.
Seeing as though a foot of one of these fuckers weighs about a hundred pounds, it ain't gonna be what you'd call easy. Any questions?
Supposing one of those cables breaks under tow.
Supposing one of those cables breaks under tow.
Then we'll all be doomed. Any other questions?
Ready?
Bring it on, dude.
Nobody just scuttles a passenger liner either.
Ever heard of insurance, big boy?
If this thing turns out to be a ship everybody thought sank a long time ago, we just hit the jackpot.
Yeah, well how the hell you get something like that wrong? That's a damn big boat. It's either sunk or it ain't.
Last thing we want is extra partners.
Or uninvited guests.
This's gonna hurt a little.
Thanks for the warning -- Ow! Damn!
What other choices have we got?
I tell you one thing, we're not gonna be towing no ship now.
Guess I'll just keep working.
What're you crazy?
What're you crazy?
I like my job.
Light in those passages ain't so good.
I'm telling you, I saw somebody. I don't know who it was. But I saw somebody.
Maybe that is his boat.
Gimme a break.
Fifty million dollars. Fifty million. We gonna let this guy just take it from us? One guy?
So we kill him?
So we kill him?
I'm saying we gotta do whatever we gotta do to preserve our interest.
One guy isn't gonna be so stupid.
Maybe he isn't alone.
Pretty handy with that scatter gun, Epps. You raised on a farm?
Seen a lota movies.
Smokes?
Oh yeah.
I'm no doctor. But I'd say he's in a coma.
A what?
A what?
I don't know what else you'd call it. He's breathing on his own, but his pupils are completely blown out. He's totally unresponsive to pain. What happened up there?
I don't know what else you'd call it. He's breathing on his own, but his pupils are completely blown out. He's totally unresponsive to pain. What happened up there?
I heard a scream. When I got there I found him on the floor. He was having some kind of seizure. I didn't see anybody else.
Other than the obvious, there's nothing wrong with him that I can see, not on the outside.
Then what the hell happened to him?
Try Wednesday.
Right. Wednesday.
Did you?
Hell no. You think I'm crazy?
What say, Epps? You up for some roasted albatross?
Why not?
Dodge. Dodge.
What?
What?
Get up.
Get up.
Yeah, yeah.
You aren't jealous, are you Dodge?
Are you kidding me? Jealous? Epps? Gimme a break.
What the hell would a freighter be doing up here? It's way out of the lanes. There's not a port for 800 miles.
Smugglers maybe.
Yeah, from one side of the harbor to the other. But we got half the Bering Sea and the whole Alaskan gulf to drag her over.
You have any idea how much a ship like that could be worth in salvage? The fittings alone could go for a few million.
You have any idea how much a ship like that could be worth in salvage? The fittings alone could go for a few million.
If you get it back in one piece.
If you get it back in one piece.
It's a risk I'm willing to take.
It's a bloody navigation hazard. One boat can't control a ship that size.
The damn thing's been floating around for God knows how long and it hasn't hit anything yet. So we take it easy. A little of the old push pull.
With a little extra fuel, weather permitting, we should make Sitka in five days without another stop.
Sounds reasonable.
Mother fucker!
What is it?
What is it?
Threw a turbine blade.
The number one turbine's pretty well trashed. Number two runs, but it's way underpowered.
How long to fix?
How long to fix?
Hard to say. I gotta get in there and have a look. At least a couple days. Depending.
What's this?
Turbine rotor's shot.

Goddamit, Dodge.
Goddamit, Dodge.
What do you want me to tell you, that we can throw this sucker back in and start pulling her like nothing happened? Can't do it, skipper.
Obviously it's some kind of screw up. The shipping records aren't a hundred percent accurate.
Man, it gives me the creeps. We got no business towing a ship that size anyway. I say we fix the turbines and hit the highway.
Went aboard.
She take a radio?
It's a hell of a lot of money.
What, you think there's something funny about it?
What, you think there's something funny about it?
A ship with fifty million dollars in gold aboard, adrift? And nobody seems to care enough to come looking for it?
Didn't happen yesterday, I'll tell you that. Torn parts rusted bad as the rest of the boat.
Then it happened before they scuttled her.
Or somebody stopped them.
Either way, they must've had a pretty good reason.
So what're we gonna do. That's the big question, right?
A salvage claim to a vessel's cargo's as valid as a claim to the vessel itself. It's ours.
A salvage claim to a vessel's cargo's as valid as a claim to the vessel itself. It's ours.
Then we're rich. We're damn, filthy stinking rich.
Then we're rich. We're damn, filthy stinking rich.
It looks like it.
You gotta be kidding? What the hell we need that tub for, we got fifty million bucks?
So we get a little more for the boat. Besides, the gold'll be safer where it is.
Yeah, yeah. I'm on it.
The sooner we get under way, the sooner we are to spending what's ours.
I'm buyin' me a nice outrigger. Spend my time hauling rich Seattle business men through the Puget.
How about you Epps?
Dreamin's all any of you're gonna be doing if we don't get this boat running.
Yeah, yeah.
Sounds like the hull.
Warm water current maybe, making the metal expand.
If somebody's aboard her already, she ain't ours. She's theirs.
Bullshit. That boat hasn't made steam for fifty years. We found her. She's ours.
Bullshit. That boat hasn't made steam for fifty years. We found her. She's ours.
Not in the eyes of the law.
I say fuck the motherfucker. We're a professional salvage crew going about our business. What's some yahoo doing way out here by himself anyway?
And what do you propose? That we knock this guy off?
And what do you propose? That we knock this guy off?
Why not? Why the fuck not?
What if that fucker finds it before we're ready to go?
We'll stand a watch. Four on, eight off. Low man first.
If he's reasonable, maybe we can make some kind of deal. If not. We'll have to re-consider our options.
Yeah, reconsider fucking his shit up.
Bodies're too fresh.
Fresh ain't the first word that comes to mind.
Damn barbaric is what it is.
Could be meant as a warning.
That'd be my guess.
So whoever did this might still be around.
Can't you use something else?
I might be able to find something on the ship. But it's gonna take time.

Do what you need to do. Just do it fast.
Do what you need to do. Just do it fast.
Right.
Dodge to Murphy.
Murphy.
Murphy.
You better get down here quick, skipper. I'm on "C" deck. Cabin 400.
You better get down here quick, skipper. I'm on "C" deck. Cabin 400.
What is it?
What is it?
I think you better see this for yourself.
It was a man's voice. Repeating some sort of children's rhyme. I don't know, it didn't make any sense. You didn't hear it?
Not me.
On a passenger ship in 1953?
If they knew what they were carrying.
So. I got a question. Just from a, you know, purely technical standpoint. We call the Coastguard. Coastguard shows up. What exactly is the plan?
How do you mean?
How do you mean?
Well, they're gonna be asking a lot of questions. About us. About those bodies. About the gold. Seems like we oughta be prepared is all.
Well, they're gonna be asking a lot of questions. About us. About those bodies. About the gold. Seems like we oughta be prepared is all.
I guess the best strategy's just to tell them the truth.
I guess the best strategy's just to tell them the truth.
Yeah, well. The truth is one thing. When there's more than a few hundred million dollars involved, that's a whole new deal.
Yeah, well. The truth is one thing. When there's more than a few hundred million dollars involved, that's a whole new deal.
What do you propose?
What do you propose?
For starters, getting that gold off the ship. What they don't know about isn't gonna bother them.
There's no way we're gonna hide a few thousand pounds of gold from the Coastguard here. Besides, it'll be safer where it is.
With all due respect, skipper. Part of that up there's mine. I'd kinda like to have a little say in what happens to it.
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?!
I don't know what you're talking about?
I don't know what you're talking about?
I think you know.
I think you know.
Maybe you can tell me then.
The radio!
The radio. Oh, yeah, the radio.
Take it easy, willya? What about the radio?!
You smashed it!
You smashed it!
What?!
What?!
Don't lie to me!
Don't lie to me!
What the fuck -- ?
What the fuck -- ?
You didn't want us calling anybody. Too liable to ruin your big payday.
You didn't want us calling anybody. Too liable to ruin your big payday.
I didn't touch the fucking radio.
I didn't touch the fucking radio! Ever occur to you there's somebody else on that boat, skipper?
Conveniently enough for you.
Conveniently enough for you.
Look, I didn't touch it. Alright?
Yeah.
You better get down here right now! We're taking water! Big time!
What the hell happened!
Turbine chamber on number two must've blown! Took out part of the hull!
That oughta buy a man pretty much anything he wants.
If money can buy what he wants.
If money can buy what he wants.
I don't figure there's much I want money can't buy.
I don't figure there's much I want money can't buy.
Then you're a lucky man.
We'll stand the watch on deck tonight. You're up first.
Right.
Tomorrow we'll see if we can't find some line and tackle. Use some of those bodies below decks for bait.
There's a charming thought.
You're late.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Don't fall asleep.
Don't fall asleep.
Right.
What's slow?
Maybe twenty gallons an hour.
Morning everybody.
Show your tatoos to that coxswain last night, did you Epps?
Show your tatoos to that coxswain last night, did you Epps?
Showed him a hell of a lot more than that.
Showed him a hell of a lot more than that.
I bet you did.
Could be a fishing boat.
Too big. More like a freighter.
Looks like one hell of a stick up his ass.
He'd let you off at the nearest port, that's for sure.
You mean, before she sank.
Cargo like this could make a crew think twice.
Then why didn't they take it.
Probably didn't have time.
Two hundred twenty two kilograms of solid gold.
That's what I call a payday.
That's what I call a payday.
Hell yeah.
That's a good thing?
Hell, yeah. I like it cold. Colder the better.
What'd he look like?
Maybe six feet. Lanky. I didn't get a good look. He was far away. But I saw him. I saw him as sure as you're standing there.
Coffee.
You're a pal.
Stay away. Or else.
Because of the gold.
Any dizziness?
No.
No.
Headache, nausea, lights?
Headache, nausea, lights?
Lights?
Lights?
Sudden flashes of light.
Sudden flashes of light.
I feel fine.
I don't even want to know what that's gonna taste like now.
Better than starving to death.
You okay?
Yeah. Fine. I just thought I heard something is all.
Yeah. Fine. I just thought I heard something is all.
What?
What?
Nothing. Let's get outa here.
I can't believe you. Dodge's dead and all you can think about is cashing in your share.
I didn't sign up to go home empty handed. And I sure ain't gonna roll over for the freaky motherfucker did this.
Candy?
It's my pen name.
Go on.
Salvage fees on a vessel like this could come in around four million bucks. At least. Who knows, could be more. Could be a lot more. What I'm proposing is... we split it four ways.
The law's on our side. If they want to challenge it, let them try.
They must've scuttled it. Nobody just lets a ship float away.
Coffee?
Yeah. Thanks.
What'd you find up there?
Some charts. A crew manifest. Looks like her last voyage was January 1953. The question is where the hell's she been since.
Some charts. A crew manifest. Looks like her last voyage was January 1953. The question is where the hell's she been since.
She was sailing up north, right?
She was sailing up north, right?
Her destination was Halifax, yeah.
Her destination was Halifax, yeah.
Well, suppose she got a little further north than she should have. Got stuck in the ice. The passengers and crew evacuated. She froze into the ice pack, which moved further north, where it froze in solid. They write it off. Fifty years later, the whole global warming thing happens. The ice melts, she gets loose and floats around til somebody runs into her.
Ever heard of the Mary Celeste?
Nope.
Nope.
She was a two-masted brig boat sailing out of New York in 1872. One day she was sighted off the coast of Portugal by a merchant vessel, the Dei Gratia. As the crew of the Dei Gratia got closer, they discovered that no one was at the helm of the Mary Celeste. On boarding, they found her completely deserted. The captain, his wife, their

So what did happen?
So what did happen?
Nobody knows. There've been a lot of theories, of course. But we'll never really know for sure.
Nobody knows. There've been a lot of theories, of course. But we'll never really know for sure.
You think she's sailing without a crew?
I think we'd be surprised where a drifting ship might wind up with a little wind and the right current.
You're more practical than superstitious.
You're more practical than superstitious.
Only way to be.
Maybe they didn't want it back. Maybe the whole fat deal was insured.
Maybe. But there's always somebody whose interest's at stake.
Why not call for help?
For now the best thing we can do is to keep quiet about this.
Take it easy, you'll live longer.
Did you see him?
Did you see him?
Who?
Who?
The guy. He just came this way.
The guy. He just came this way.
What guy?
What guy?
There's somebody else on this boat.
There's somebody else on this boat.
What? What the hell're you talking about.

I saw him. Just a minute ago. Some guy.
I saw him. Just a minute ago. Some guy.
Are you sure?
Are you sure?
Of course I'm sure. I saw him.
Of course I'm sure. I saw him.
You sure it wasn't me?
You sure it wasn't me?
It wasn't you. It was somebody else. There's somebody else aboard.
So, we find this guy and make a deal with him.
We don't exactly have the best bargaining position.
Guess that'd be me. Again.
Dodge, get on that turbine. I don't care if you don't sleep for a week. The sooner you're done, the sooner we can get out of here. How's the food situation?
No cowboy shit up there, understand?
No cowboy shit. Right.
Got your light?
Yup.
Murphy to Epps.
Epps.
Epps.
You just shoot at something?
You just shoot at something?
Yeah. Just a bird. Just a stupid bird.
Just before I heard him yell there was somebody on the radio.
Greer?
Greer?
I don't know. No. Not Greer. Somebody.
He needs a doctor.
I'll call us in. Dodge, see how many signal flares you can scrounge up. Keep an eye on him.
How's he doing?
Same. Any luck?
Same. Any luck?
No. I'll try again later.
They're dead in the water that morning. Four hours later the captain's relieved of his command. And that evening they issue a general SOS.
Possibly false. Hence the IMA record of being lost at sea. I don't think mutiny's out of the question here.
You're saying they mutinied for the gold?
If they were close enough to shore, they probably figured they could get away in the lifeboats.
If they were close enough to shore, they probably figured they could get away in the lifeboats.
Only something must've gone wrong.
The ah... the radio's out.
What?
What?
Somebody took it out of commission last night.
Smashed it up pretty bad.
But, who -- ?
"The crew have gone mad with greed and fight among themselves like wild dogs over fresh kill."
February first.
February first.
The same day she supposedly went down.
The same day she supposedly went down.
Must not've been the captain's entry. He was probably out of the picture by then.
"Their lacking diligence has undoubtedly caused the collision. Distress calls have been made."
Collision? With what?
Collision? With what?
The page's missing. Then their SOS was real.
The page's missing. Then their SOS was real.
But where's the damage?
But where's the damage?
Maybe the other ship took the worst of it.
Maybe the other ship took the worst of it.
If it was a ship she hit.
It's a good bet they'll be asking a lot of questions when they get here too.
Let 'em ask. This ship's legally ours now.
It's not gonna hold us.
Doesn't matter.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Couldn't sleep.
Couldn't sleep.
Wish I could say the same.
What do you think happened on this boat?
I guess that's the sixty four thousand dollar question, isn't it?
I guess that's the sixty four thousand dollar question, isn't it?
The what?
The what?
Never mind. Before your time. I think at least some of the crew went a little nuts. The usual stuff that happens when people stumble on a fortune. Equal parts greed and paranoia, usually resulting in homicide. What happened after that is anybody's guess. But, judging by our Greek friends down below, it doesn't look like the last time.

Are we smart enough to avoid that?

I don't know, are we?
When you found me yesterday, at the pool. I'd seen... something. Someone.
Not our mystery guest again.
Not our mystery guest again.
No. Someone else. A girl. I'm not sure she was... real.
What, like some kind of ghost?
I don't know what else you'd call her. One second she was there, the next she was gone.
Maybe hallucination is the wrong word. It was more than that. As though they were showing me.
Showing you what?
Showing you what?
What happened.
What happened.
Maybe it was one of them did the handy work on those Greeks.

No. I think they are, were, just passengers. Innocent victims.

Victims of what?

Something bad happened here, Murphy.
Something bad happened here, Murphy.
That much I think we've already established.
That much I think we've already established.
More than just a mutiny. More than just the gold.
She said the ship was evil. That we had to leave right away. That if we didn't, we might never leave.
What's that supposed to mean?
What's that supposed to mean?
I don't know.
Why you? How come the rest of us haven't seen these people?
Just lucky I guess.
Murphy to Epps.
Epps, over.
Epps, over.
Either of you seen Dodge?
Nope.
He's not on deck and I can't raise him on the radio.
Epps? You there?
Right here.
What do we do with him?
Leave him till we can get some help. From now on, nobody comes down here.
What do you think?
Could be a stroke. Who knows? The general log said the crew were fighting among themselves. "Like wild dogs."
Could be a stroke. Who knows? The general log said the crew were fighting among themselves. "Like wild dogs."
Over the gold.
Over the gold.
Maybe it was more than that.
They went crazy.
Crazy with greed. Not crazy. Not like him.
Hard to say which is worse, staying here or taking our chances in open water.
If the weather holds it might not be so bad.
If the weather holds it might not be so bad.
It's not the weather I'm worried about. The wrong current could drag us as far as the Aleutians before we come across another boat.
What happened?
We hit land.
We hit land.
What?
What?
We're in an island chain. It's only a matter of time before we hit another one.
We're in an island chain. It's only a matter of time before we hit another one.
Greer's gone. He broke out of the tank.
You killed them.
It was only a matter of time before somebody killed somebody. You saw it coming as well as I did. Dodge had his plans, starting with scuttling the boat. And Greer too, except he went nuts. Couldn't take it, I guess. Could've happened in the middle of downtown Anchorage. But did it make him any less dangerous? I don't think so.

So you killed them?
So you killed them?
The way I figure it, it was them or me. I thought putting Dodge up on that pipe was a nice touch? Bought a little time. Made it look like whoever killed those Greeks was still around. But it's just us on this ship. Us and your... spirit friends.

And now you're gonna kill me, is that it?
And now you're gonna kill me, is that it?
I didn't want it to turn out this way.
I didn't want it to turn out this way.
Murphy, don't you see what's happening?
Murphy, don't you see what's happening?
I think I see it pretty well.
I think I see it pretty well.
It's the ship. The ship's making you think this way.

I know a little bit about human nature and what I've seen only confirms that.
I know a little bit about human nature and what I've seen only confirms that.
It's a trap. There was no way we were gonna get away with that gold. Nobody ever does. It's just the bait. This ship sucks people in and it never lets them out.

I think maybe you been on this boat a little too long, with all that supernatural mumbo jumbo. There's nothing supernatural about greed. And that's what it comes down to, pure and simple.

I don't give a damn about the gold.
I don't give a damn about the gold.
I wish I could believe that. Either way, you know what I've done. I've got no choice.
Greer to Murphy.
Go.
The number nine on the starboard side's half flooded. Epps says it's a slow leak just under the waterline, about twenty gallons an hour. They must've pumped it before we left Sitka.
Of course they did.
Of course they did.
Let the buyer beware.
Let the buyer beware.
What do you say, Dodge?
Not bad for dragging a leaky tub half way to Russia.
He'll sell the scrap for three times what he paid.
He'll sell the scrap for three times what he paid.
I must be in the wrong business.
I must be in the wrong business.
You got that right.
You got that right.
Better than "making hamburger for Mickey D."
Red sky at night, sailor's delight.
Red sky in morning, sailor take warning.
Yeah.
There's a large vessel out about ten miles to the north-west.
I been watching it for close to an hour and it hasn't moved. I can't raise it on the radio either. Makes me think it might be in trouble.
Alright. I'll be right up.
Too deep to anchor out there.
Looks like it's adrift.
Call the Coastguard?
Steer to one eight five. Let's check her out.
It's funny.
How's that?
How's that?
Besides a little rust, everything's pretty well-preserved.
Murphy, goddamit.
Sorry.
Whatever the reason, she's adrift and abandoned. We've got every right to salvage her.
You mean tow her back? That's a thirty thousand ton ship you're talking about.
You mean tow her back? That's a thirty thousand ton ship you're talking about.
We've done it before.
All we got to do is hit some rough weather and you can forget about it.
So we cut her loose and wait it out. A little weather couldn't be anything she hasn't seen before.
Some classy tub in it's day, huh?
Yeah.
Morning.
You're up late.
You're up late.
Guess I must've fallen back to sleep. Where's Epps?
How much you figure that's worth, skipper?
Hard to say. Maybe forty, fifty million.
Hard to say. Maybe forty, fifty million.
Ho, baby!
If they thought it was lost at sea, they probably just wrote it off.
Not for fifty million. An ocean liner maybe. But fifty million in gold, they come looking for.
So what? We gonna unload the gold and get a move on?
We leave it where it is. Stick to the plan.
Yeah, but we still gotta haul that big piece of shit all the way back to Sitka.
It's worth the effort. Believe me. Besides we're gonna need her to prove the salvage.
I heard that.
Dodge, you gotta get on those repairs.
What now?
We could call for help.
We could call for help.
And get a bunch of fools sniffin' around here?
Fifty million four ways. That's twelve million and change a piece. What you gonna do with your share, skipper?
Not much at all, I guess. Retire. Live out my golden years and all that.
