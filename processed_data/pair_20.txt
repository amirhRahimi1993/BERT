Breakfast.
Why don't you bring it out here? It's beautiful out here.
I know what you are thinking. I'm not going to disappear, okay? I'm not going anywhere, just down there, to that beautiful beach. I got to get out of this room, just for a little while.
Okay.
Okay.
Really?

But he won't shoot you right then?
But he won't shoot you right then?
No. It would be amateur. A risk. He'll wait for the prime shot, that he knows is coming. Once I'm inside, he'll move to the hotel. He'll go up the back, too much traffic in the front.
You'll be here. A restaurant. A public place far enough away that he won't notice you, but with a good enough view you'll be able to see him when he moves inside.
Okay. Then what?
Okay. Then what?
Then, we wait.

Aiiee. More waiting? I don't know if I like this plan.

It will take the entire day, but he will begin to doubt himself. He will begin to believe that he missed me, that somehow I slipped by and am already on a plane to Europe.
The sun will be low, almost dark, the air cool and the bank will almost be closed. 5:45. 5:50. He will put the rifle down, he will get up and he will walk across the plaza to the bank.
Why won't he wait until the bank closes?
Why won't he wait until the bank closes?
He won't be able to. He'll have to go inside. He'll have to see with his own eyes, whether or not I am there. If the bank closes, he won't know for sure. He'll come. I'm sure. And when he does you'll go into the hotel, go upstairs and take the gun.

What? What if he brings it with him?
He can't. The bank has an expensive security system; metal detectors and X-ray machines.
That means you won't have a gun.

For Nicholai?

You killed him here? In this city, outside that bank?

Yeah, but it's not just that. To the Czech mind, any movement, whether political or literary should be underground. If it isn't, then it's not radical and not worthy of a look-in.

Sorry Katka, but I'm with Doug on this.
You're outnumbered Kat two to one, got to go with the majority, that's democracy.
What about that squat bar you showed me, is that open on a Sunday?

Anything in it?
No, just crap. I want some picture frames.

I don't have the money for those Bourgeois traps. Hell, I'm making what a Czech earns.
Yeah and they manage to go to bourgeois joints!
It all comes down to ideology and they've lost theirs. If I'd been here ten years ago, maybe they wouldn't be in the mess they are today.

Good news comrades, it's better than we'd hoped. Lubosh filled me in on the legal side of squatting here and it's a piece of cake.
Care to elaborate?
Care to elaborate?
Well, providing we're treated like Czechs and we squat something that's not privately owned, we should be in the clear; at least DOUG until they get an eviction order and bring in the bailiffs.

Amazing, he didn't even say "if".
Amazing, he didn't even say "if".
No "if's" or "but's" it's a cinch. Do you want to know what the icing is?
Okay, we're listening. But I'm with Katka on this one.
Well, it's like I said, there's a ton of empty buildings around here and most of them were apparently given back to the city, so they're not private.... Now, Jahn here is an drama student at the University. He knows of a building that they were going to turn into a puppet theatre - they even began work on it, until they ran out

Puppet theatre, don't you need something a little bigger?
Puppet theatre, don't you need something a little bigger?
It's big, right Jahn?
Okay, it's in here somewhere. Let's keep it quiet.
We could make a run for it?
You were right Jahn, it's a great space..... Hey, Chris. Do you want to come and look?
No thanks, I think we ought to get going though.
Chris, what if I were to cut you in as partner in this project - together we could make it swing, all it needs is a good clean out and the power on, then we're in business.
I don't know man, I'll drink beer and shoot crap with you anytime, but this is different.

Damn right it is, it's a chance to do something meaningful for a change, to leave our mark on this town. Hell, you'll probably be gone in another six months and all you'll have done is taught some kids the lines to a Led Zep' song - c'mon, don't run out on me now!

Alright I give in. But let's not end up in jail. Okay?
Alright I give in. But let's not end up in jail. Okay?
You got my word on it.
No, I got nothing till Tuesday.
Great. Let's say nine o'clock here tomorrow. Catch you later partner.
That stinks!
Yeah, that could be job number two. I think it's a sewer.
No, but like my dad said, "There's only so many ways you can wire a plug".
He was an electrician?

No, he was talking about girls, I think.

That makes you an expert I guess.
That makes you an expert I guess.
Too right....Now the other thing we've got to do is start clearing up the rubble. Can you make a start on that?
I feel like a mole in this joint, so I guess I might as well come out lookin' like one!
Don't worry, I'll give you a hand as soon as I can.
Just two things. What do I use to shift the stuff and where in hell am I gonna put it all?
Scout around and see if there's something, check that other corridor. If there's nothing, nip out and buy a broom and shovel.

And put it on expenses?
And put it on expenses?
Sure....As for the crap, I've got an idea.
Somehow, I'm going to have to band-aid that thing since we can't really replace it and then put a walkway over it.
So?
So?
Well, we might as well start filling it in now. As long as you leave enough room around that end of the pipe - so I can get to it, we're set. Use them wooden boards to stop it all spilling into the space - We'll neaten it up later.

Yeah, you're in luck there's two of them, the other's in there.
Yeah, you're in luck there's two of them, the other's in there.

I've been saying that since we met.
I've been saying that since we met.
Yes, but it suddenly clicked, this is going to be a crazy place and, since the Commies are used to seeking asylum, we can use that in the marketing.
Perfect, but I can't use it right now, I've got to get these locks done; it's a matter of priorities.
Yeah, I'm beginning to see that.
Yeah, I'm beginning to see that.
Just save me a little patch and I'll do it later.
I don't know but that used to be a window and I think that was a door.
Can you do the lock on it?
Can you do the lock on it?
No, it's welded up!....Let's take a look from the inside.
It must be on the other side of this.
But how did the wall get here?

Don't worry if the old lady's there I'll brick it back up.
Look I gotta get going, shouldn't you have met Katka?
Is it gone four-thirty?
Need any disks?
Yeah, I'll take some.
Yeah, her name's Kavlova, why?
See if she can donate some paintings or something to hang on these walls, give it a bit of atmosphere.

You'd be better off with tables and chairs.
Moved on to plumbing huh?
We got a party tomorrow night. Can't have the place smelling like shit.
I thought you were gonna throw these?
I had a better idea, we'll burn them. There's a drum across the road; I was just waiting for the workers to go home.

Like a hand?
When your ready Son!
Do you think anyone will really come here?
Well, I think I_ve got a handle on the Czech pysche and I reckon this kind of joint will make _em reminisce about the sixties. Plus we should get a few stray expat_s looking for Kafka.
Fancy some lunch after we_re through with this Meccano shit?
Sure, I think it_s your turn to buy too.
We'd better get some booze in for tonight.
You should have said it was Bring-A-Bottle.
You should have said it was Bring-A-Bottle.
No, I figure once they see the place and we get'em a little drunk, they'll all want to help. We should have that floor done in a day or so.
Here, let's both put in two hundred crowns. That should get nine or ten bottles of wine.
No beer?
No beer?
Not on the opening night, wouldn't look right.
You get the wine and I'll go see if I can rustle up some plastic cups.
Why don't we go together?
Why don't we go together?
No, it could take me hours. You know what it's like trying to find things in this town, not to mention disposable stuff - I wouldn't think they've ever heard of them.
Red or white?
Both, see you later.
I see, you've got your hands too far up your collective arse to pull it out long enough except to drink my bloody wine.
Forget it Doug, it's no good.
Have you cleared all the rubble up?
No, not yet.
No, not yet.
You're all bloody useless.
Get me a couple of beers and a salami.
We could make a start on the floor afterwards.

He got that one right.

Honza says they'll print an open letter to President Havel in next weeks edition even if they have to threaten a walk-out.
They're good guys..... Have you seen Holly?
No, but I ran into Jahn, seems him and his friends are in big trouble with the University, they might even be expelled.

I could try and get a Western lawyer.
You know, there is one thing I can't figure out. All along they've been bugging me about those files and when I told them I'd burned all that stuff, they went nuts - they told the Consul guy they were medical records?
So?
So?
Well, it seems they've dropped any charge relating to the files.
Well, it seems they've dropped any charge relating to the files.
Lucky break!
Lucky break!
Maybe, but I've started to wonder what those files were all about. Suppose it was old KGB stuff and had the dirt on big people or maybe the personnel records of the secret police, that might explain all the hassle and the cover-up.

I should have read the fine print. I love you Holly, thanks.
What about me?

Time for lunch I think. I'll get the sandwiches. What would you like Holly?
I'm not hungry, really.
Yeah, no problem.
We ain't going to give it away this time, are we?
I can't go with him.
Look, I don't care whether you go with Doug or not, but you_ve got to see him before he leaves.
You don't understand, I can't!
Listen, Doug took the rap for us all so grab your coat 'cause you're going.

Well not any more, now I'm a serious writer and above this crap.

I'm not staying out late and I can't come back to your place.
Whatever!
A word of advice my celibate friend. These Czech girls look like dynamite and go like it, but don't be fooled; there's a price to be paid and it's going up fast. Right Kat?
What?
What?
You're everything a guy could want.
It's just talk, he's drunk.
No I'm not, I came to Prague looking for something - this could be it!
Don't give me this Kat, I'm doing it for you and your country.
What? You are crazy!
What? You are crazy!
Look, just hear me out, okay?
Doug I can't, I've got to be at work by eight. You promised to take me home.
Look Kat it'll only take ten minutes. Without Jahn I might never find it... We'll just have a quick look and then you and I'll hit a tram.
I don't want to get in trouble.
Don't worry it's okay!
I'm not going in Doug. I'll wait for you here.
Okay, whatever. Come on Chris!
Doug you said you wouldn't be long. Come on, I've got to go. Now!
Alright, I'm coming. It's the perfect place Jahn, thanks.
It's not fair, you hardly talked to me tonight.
I'm sorry but it's been a crazy evening. I'm going to make that place into something big. God, I love you!
Let's walk over the bridge, we haven't done that for a while.
We should go to the Metro it's quicker.
We should go to the Metro it's quicker.
Nonsense, we can pick up the tram on the other side, it won't take any longer. Come on!
Kat, I'm in paradise. I don't ever want to leave.
So, we won't be going to London?
So, we won't be going to London?
No, not just yet.
I hope you're going to invite me in?
Everybody is at home, it's no good.
Everybody is at home, it's no good.
Let's have a look anyway.
She's tired.
It's bad news when you can't even bribe kids.
I want you so bad. She'll be asleep soon, maybe we could do it quietly under the sheets.
No way Doug, I can't.
No way Doug, I can't.
Yeah, you're right.... I've got an idea!
Beer please! Do you want another drink?
Fernet and tonic.
I think I'm stupid.....All you do is use me and expect me to wait for you.
No.
No.
I thought you loved me Doug but all you want from me is sex.
That's not true, we have a great time together. I've said I'm sorry. Let's forget about it and go stop by my place, so I can get changed.
Oh sure and you will want sex, always sex.
I could have my choice of many boyfriends and go to movies and discos but I waste my time waiting for you and then going to stupid pubs.
I'm not a bloody teenager okay, I told you I can't do that shit.
I'm not a bloody teenager okay, I told you I can't do that shit.
That's it, I am just stupid teenager, yes?
That's it, I am just stupid teenager, yes?
Right now, yeah - you're talking crap.
No, I love you, really.
Then tell me, what will happen? Tell me!
Then tell me, what will happen? Tell me!
Look, I love you Katka but I'm twelve years older, I could never marry you, it'd be stupid, you know that!
I thought for sure they would catch me.
Thanks.
Will it help to get you out?
I hope so!
If you get out can we be together again.
I'm no good for you Katka, besides I won't be able to stay in Prague.
I'm no good for you Katka, besides I won't be able to stay in Prague.
But we could go to London and live in England.
But we could go to London and live in England.
No Kat, I lied to you, I hate England and I don't ever want to live there again.
I don't understand, it's your home?
There's nothing there for me.
There's nothing there for me.
I'm sorry about what I said, really I am. Just take me with you, I don't care where.
Forget about me Kat.
But I love you!
It was a mistake, I never wanted to hurt you, but it had to end sooner or later and now, well now I love someone else.
No, it's not true, you're lying.
No, it's not true, you're lying.
Not this time, Kat.
Yeah, for sure.
And, since it's only two streets away, I suggest we go take a look. Now!
No, I am an actor not a labourer, I am just warning you, that's all.
Don't worry, I've got lots of friends.
Interesting. Do reckon I could fit through here?
Sure, I've done it easily.
Sure, I've done it easily.
Hey Chris, keep an eye on things.
Hi, want to take up dancing?
Later. Jahn, I've been let down by the guys who were going to do the flooring. They brought the materials but took my money and ran. You guys have a school theatre don't you?

Well, I want them to put down a floor and a walkway.
There's three thousand crowns, it's all I got.
It's not so much.

Look, if you can get them to finish it by Friday, you and your friends can do the opening performance that night.

Donations only! And make the thing non-lingual, so everyone gets a handle on it.
I'll do my best. Is the place open.
Yep, it's all yours.
Yep, it's all yours.
Okay.
They'll do it.
Great. And your all set for the performance?
Great. And your all set for the performance?
Yeah, it's a simple piece. If they get the floor done in time, me and the others will rehearse tomorrow afternoon, but it's not critical.
Yeah, it's a simple piece. If they get the floor done in time, me and the others will rehearse tomorrow afternoon, but it's not critical.
Don't go making it too simple, we're on the cutting edge here.
No thanks, I must go, but maybe you could get some beers for the guys.
Don't worry. Thanks.
Yes, it's looks good.....We will use this for the soundtrack and we will have two guys up there with the spotlights. The others will just be house lights.
Great....How long will it go for?
Great....How long will it go for?
About forty minutes.

Cool....So, if we say eight o'clock.
Okay?
Yo, dobree!

Yes, of course...maybe one hour.
Yes, of course...maybe one hour.
Good, great....Dobchay!
Tomorrow, we will bring some lights and also hang some fabric. I think it will be finished in the morning.
It's perfect, you've done a great job.
You mean you don't know, Henry! We got a bunch of anarchists, controlling a six-level block of luxury apartments down on Janovska street here in the Old Town, and you don't know about it?
Ah, so what?
Ah, so what?
That's only the half of it. I've heard a rumour they're taking over a theatre to use for alternative arts; you know what that means?
Henry, these guys already push most of the drugs in this town and now they want to move into pornography, right? Believe me, it won't stop there either, next it'll be a church and pretty soon they'll have their own department store or something...... Henry, we've got to stop them. The foundation's got to put an end to it!
How?
How?
I'm in close with these guys, it isn't easy, but slowly they're opening up to me. Give me a month and I'll blow their movement wide open.

What pay-check? You ain't done nothing!
What pay-check? You ain't done nothing!
Henry, I've been working my tail off on this. Look, all I need is a little cash to loosen up some tongues and you've got the scoop. It'll send those scum-bags down for life; be a big feather in the cap for the Bugler and your board of directors back home!

I got a bad feeling about this.... How much do you need?
I got a bad feeling about this.... How much do you need?
Two hundred dollars, make it six thousand crowns?
There's three thousand and if you don't come through, I'm going throw you clean out of that window. Deal?
Deal!
And take Jiri with you?
What for?
What for?
Insurance!
Any chance of getting me out on bail?
What is bail?
Will they free me?
I don't know - maybe they are talking about it now. Mr Vitovetch is a good friend of the Judge.

I will tell you - within a week I will have the transcript and we can go through it.
No act of love but willing violence demanded by one and begged by the other. As life turned to fantasy and reality to ecstasy a need, so deep no light could reach, surfaced like a nocturnal creature unearthed for momentary and glorious display. Left alone in a rose-tinted afterglow dimming fast she tasted the moisture of her body and wondered why light came to
Well she sure isn't normal.
I'll put one on the notice-board too.
Am I invited?
Am I invited?
Sure as long as you don't bring that prick Josh. Thanks Lawrence.
I thought I'd help out.
We don't need you.
We don't need you.
That's not what you said last night. And, I didn't bring that "prick" Josh.
Alright, go help Chris shovel up the last of the crap.
Thanks.
Seems a shame!
The way I look at it, I've carried the camel to water and stuffed it's head under - if it doesn't drink now, we might as well shoot the thing and call it a day.
Why are you doing all this, what for?
Well, I've failed at everything else I've done and I can't hack it as a journalist, even for the Bugler.

Are you sure I shouldn't get a doctor.

We'll have to see what more we can do for you, while you are still our guest.

Thanks, but I don't intend to stay.
Thanks, but I don't intend to stay.
Really!
Really!
I lied to you, I didn't destroy the floppy disks.
Good try Mr. Greenwell but a little late. We have analyzed the contents of that drum, the remains of the disks are there, just as you said.
Not all of them!
You are playing a very dangerous game, I suggest you make it easy on yourself and tell me where they are.
I didn't get to see what's on the disks but I can guess. Do you want to hear my terms or not.
What is it you want?
First, I want to walk free with a letter, in English, from the Prosecutor General dropping all charges. Second, I want two first class tickets to London leaving tonight and three thousand crowns in a stamped envelope. Lastly, all actions against the students are to be stopped!
I'm not sure it's possible.
The choice is yours, it's not negotiable.
And the students?
I have the Director's word, there will be no action against them. You may go once we have the disks.

You may use my office.
Would you like your things now?
Yeah!
Yeah!
Release Mr Greenwell's possessions.
Central station, locker number 139 - combination JFK.
Good, wait here, it will not take long and then you may go.
We had a deal!
Yes, you are free to go, Karel here will drive you home.
That's okay I like the metro, it's only a couple of stops from here.
I insist, it is the least we can do.
Hey Doug, where you been?
Working....Under cover.
No, just a drill.
A drill, what are you up to?
A drill, what are you up to?
Nothing. I've got to put up some kitchen shelves that's all. You've got one haven't you?

Come on, don't me give a hard time. I'm just trying to make the place look nice for Katka.
Sure!
Give me a break, will you. How often do I ask you for something?
Give me a break, will you. How often do I ask you for something?
Okay, Okay, but I want it right back. It belongs to my father.
Okay, Okay, but I want it right back. It belongs to my father.
No problem, is it at your place?

But I have to finish this....
But I have to finish this....
Come on, that shit can wait.
So, he didn't fire you?
No way, he even gave me back pay.
When the hell did you write that?
Just yesterday.
Just yesterday.
Shit Honey, you could've told me. People might think it's about us!
Shit Honey, you could've told me. People might think it's about us!
Maybe it is!
All I'm saying Honey is run the thing past me for Christ's sake before you get up and broadcast the crap.
Oh that's it? Everything I do is crap!
I decided to help out at the Asylum.
See you brought one of the patients with you too.
Josh!
Well come on, sit down.
Yeah, so I hear. Don't you think you should go get changed?
Later.
Later.
Okay honey, but don't be long. I got plans.
I think we should be going honey.
What for?
What for?
Well, for a start, you've got to get cleaned up.
Well, for a start, you've got to get cleaned up.
Why?
I don't want to go.
It's time to go home, Holly.
Come on Holly!
Leave me, just leave me alone Josh.
That's my bag.
Go to hell!
Go to hell!
It's more than what you're worth.
It's more than what you're worth.
You bastard!
You bastard!
Yeah and you're a slut, so what?
Shall I look after the rest?
Don't you dare, I'll be back!
Honey what a pleasant surprise, sorry to keep you waiting.
Josh, I have to speak you, it's urgent.
Josh, I have to speak you, it's urgent.
Of course Darling, you'd like to apologise?
Of course Darling, you'd like to apologise?
Can we talk in your office?
So, what have you got to say for yourself? Was he good in bed?
Josh, I need your help. Doug's been arrested, he's in big trouble. I thought maybe your father and the Embassy might be able to do something.
Josh, I need your help. Doug's been arrested, he's in big trouble. I thought maybe your father and the Embassy might be able to do something.
You really are a piece of work, you know that? You walk out on me and my family for some worthless bum and you expect us to help him when he screws up.
Will you come home and forget all about him?
Yes, if you can get him free.
Yes, if you can get him free.
Alright, I'll see to it and things'll be just as they were, okay?
Why are there still such headlines?
This press we cannot control. Americans, I think.

The files are in a sealed room and the University are under strict orders to stay away.
The storage facility will be ready within a week, I'll call you then.
You are responsible...What has happened?
We're not sure...
What are you an idiot!
The building has been occupied and the locks have been changed.
The building has been occupied and the locks have been changed.
The University cannot do this. Is the room safe?
The University cannot do this. Is the room safe?
Yes, I think so, it is still barred, but it is not the University who are in the building.
So, who is in the building?
Some Americans?
Have you lost all control of this city?
I don't understand it, there were a lot of people there last night, many Americans, I believe we should move carefully.
I don't understand it, there were a lot of people there last night, many Americans, I believe we should move carefully.
I don't think you realise what will happen if those files are made public. The lives of thousands of officers depend on the secrecy of those records, including your own now.
It was crazy not to have destroyed them
That was not my decision, I can only guess that one day we will again be active and our honour restored. In the meantime no one else must know those files exist. Secure the building and I will arrange alternative safe storage immediately.

And what of these foreigners?
And what of these foreigners?
I don't care about Americans. Arrest them all if you have to, but keep those records secret.
And there has been enquiries from the American Embassy maybe they are involved?
All the more reason to eliminate him.
All the more reason to eliminate him.
What if his accomplices have made copies?
What if his accomplices have made copies?
It was all on a Russian format, I don't think that would be so easy; we must take that chance.
Delay Mr Greenwell's departure until the disks have been located and you have notified me. Then, have one of your officers drive him home - I'll see to the rest.
Very well.
Very well.
Subtitles) You have made many mistakes Pavel, let there be no more, for your sake.
So go dance.
With you.

I. Don't. Dance.
She's coming over here...
Heart be still.
That's one girl who can't take a hint.
Because she doesn't know what a hint is.

A late night or an early morning?
Late night. You?
Late night. You?
Were you with Jamie?
Were you with Jamie?
Yeah.
Yeah.
You sleeping with her?
Honey, some of this is... farfetched. You take after me. People skills and common sense. Good dependable qualities.
I could take after Dad, too.

You do. You're handsome and charming.

I could do it if I tried. Even Kelly thinks so.
I could do it if I tried. Even Kelly thinks so.
That'd be something.
But if it doesn't happen, grab for something within reach. Life's tough enough without causing yourself disappointment --
Whatever my life is, I'm going to be friggin' sure I'm never disappointed --
Have I told you how proud I am of you -- ?
Mom, great. But what I want is for me to be proud of me.
I'm sorry. I didn't know.
I didn't know either.
I told him to leave me alone.
Landon --
Landon --
It was the only thing I've ever asked him!
I have no idea what to say. How to act. What if I do the wrong thing?
Be yourself and I don't think there is a wrong thing. Let Jamie take the lead. She'll let you know what she needs.
What are you doing here?
He wants to talk to you.
He wants to talk to you.
Now it's okay?
Now it's okay?
Landon. You have two parents. We're both here for you even --
Everything's being done but it's not enough. I have to find something -- more.
Landon, honey. There's nothing more.
Where is he? He's supposed to be here.
I need to whizz.
I'm thinking.
No thinking. The doctor only gives you three seconds to decide --
Hypotheticals --
I'm just wondering --
Don't call him a dipshit.
You do --
You do --
And you don't. What's she doing in there?
The address?!
York Ave.
Deranged.
Demented.
She's like some Puritan.
She's not. She's got her own ideas.
Belinda's telling everyone that kiss was real.
It was.
And that you're scamming on Jamie Sullivan.
Scamming's a strong word.
Landon!

Say nothing. Nothing 'bout her.
No. Hey. We're sorry, man!
Who are you?

Your book and your brown sweater and your hair. What's more to know -- ?

You mean care what you say? I'm worrying about other things.
Like what? The moons of Jupiter?

Good, cuz talking to you is like trying to explain red to a blind person.
'I hope your dreams come true.'
'They won't.'
'They won't.'
'Believe in yourself and they will. Let me ask you, Lizzie. Look in the mirror? Are you pretty --?'
'Is it really me?'
'Yes. You're-you're b-b- beautiful.'
You're like this fly, buzzing buzzing everywhere --

My act?!
I know you don't want help.
Then we both know. I'll point. You drive. Faster.
Yeah.
Why?

Because that's where the fire is?
Fire is like a living thing. Wild. Unpredictable.
Like me.
Like me.
No. Not like you.
What the -- ?!
So you agree you need help?
What's with the friggin numbers?
28 is do something illegal. 42 is befriend an enemy.
28 is do something illegal. 42 is befriend an enemy.
I'm an enemy?
I'm an enemy?
Kinda. Yeah.
The reason I got the part... I'm a little like Lizzie. Except I don't worry about some man rescuing me.
Good thing.
You got some kind of list?
Are you asking to mock me or do you really want to know?
Are you asking to mock me or do you really want to know?
Maybe a little of both.
I'll take a chance.
Go for it.
Go for it.
It's like a to-do list, but for my life.
So what else is on this list?
It's private.
It's private.
You want to tell me...
Get very wasted. Lose your virginity --
Spend a year in the Peace Corps. Make a medical discovery --
Spend a year in the Peace Corps. Make a medical discovery --
Ambitious.
Like you'd know.
I do know. Be two places at once... learn to hit a baseball or turn a cartwheel... eat breakfast with chopsticks...
No problem --
And you have to meet my father.
I'll get something for us to drink --
Don't bother!
I know. Don't say anything.
He's a softy. Got him wrapped around my finger.
He's a softy. Got him wrapped around my finger.
You think so.
You think so.
Know so.
Because I try to be nice to people?
Yeah. Maybe. I dunno.
Yeah. Maybe. I dunno.
Do you think I'm strange?
Cuz it's dark and quiet and you can see into another world.
The world of the dead?
The world of the dead?
Could be...
What is that?
That is my telescope.
Saturn. Beautiful.
Before Voyager we expected maybe a dozen rings --

But there are thousands of them, made of floating ice --

Maybe debris from a moon that broke apart.

Or building blocks for a world that never formed.
Looking for intelligent life?
Looking for something -- someone.
Do you believe you'll see your mother again?
I hope so. I think maybe she sees me now.
I'm building a larger one to see the nucleus of Haley's Comet --
The dirty snowball at its core.
The dirty snowball at its core.
Yeah. I'm probably not going to be around next time it comes.
Yeah. I'm probably not going to be around next time it comes.
In 76 years, me neither.
You're really into God, right?
In ten words or less?
In ten words or less?
Yeah.
Yeah.
My relationship with God is my own.
My relationship with God is my own.
But you think about Him -- It -- Her.
But you think about Him -- It -- Her.
Don't you?
Like in a church painting. I see this giant hovering over the ground. He's wearing a robe, and has long flowing hair, and he's pointing his finger at something.
Do you ever wonder why things happen the way they do?
Do you ever wonder why things happen the way they do?
No.
No.
I know there's a plan for everyone, but sometimes I don't understand what the message is -- or what the point is.
I know there's a plan for everyone, but sometimes I don't understand what the message is -- or what the point is.
There is no point. You live. You die. The end.
You have to believe to have faith.
You don't believe in anything?
You don't believe in anything?
The Bible. Why should I read a bunch of dumb stories about some ancient guy who supposedly worked miracles.
The Bible. Why should I read a bunch of dumb stories about some ancient guy who supposedly worked miracles.
Interpreted by another guy like my father.
Interpreted by another guy like my father.
Your father doesn't like me.
He doesn't trust you.
Sometimes I don't even trust me.
The play's going to be really good.
I'm really glad you think so.
You're not in a very good mood.
You don't miss a thing.
The play's in a couple of weeks.
Yes. And?
Oh. Just not at school...
Yeah --
Yeah --
Or anywhere where people might see us.
Or anywhere where people might see us.
Belinda's a very jealous person.
Belinda's a very jealous person.
That would be the reason.
So it's like you want to be secret friends.
That's it! Exactly! You're reading my mind --
That's it! Exactly! You're reading my mind --
Then maybe you can read mine.
He okay?
Healthy as can be.
You were great the other night.
Thank you. So were you.
I haven't been nice to you.
You're hardly nice to anyone.
People can see.
And that would ruin your reputation how?
Maybe you inspire me.
That sounds like horseshit.
All of it.
It's not.
It's not.
Prove it.
Okay. Maybe some of that is true --
You don't know the first thing about being someone's friend --
You don't know the first thing about being someone's friend --
I don't want to be just your friend --
I don't want to be just your friend --
You don't know what you want --
You don't know what you want --
You don't either. Take a look at yourself. Maybe you're scared that someone might actually like you --
You don't either. Take a look at yourself. Maybe you're scared that someone might actually like you --
And why would that scare me?
And why would that scare me?
Because then you couldn't hide behind your books and your telescope and your sweater and your God.
It's a start.
Yeah, with a finish in about a decade.
So you're talking to me?
When I have something to say.
What does that mean?!
It means you can do anything.
Hey.
I heard what you did. Thank you.
She great or what?
Why are you doing all this? To impress me?
Why are you doing all this? To impress me?
No. But are you -- impressed?
Like fire.
What?
What?
You.
Yes. But not as a date date.
Why not?
Why not?
I'm not allowed to date.
I can't believe you asked my father's permission.
I wanted this to be a date.
Is there a rush?
I have to get you home by one.
I have to get you home by one.
It's only 7:30.
It's only 7:30.
We're going somewhere. After. And no. I didn't ask your father.
Your turn.
No.
No.
I know you want to.
Before we do this.
We're doing something -- ?
We're doing something -- ?
Before we do this, I just want to say that a good life's gotta be about more than achieving stuff -- like on your list.
It's about working with what you already have -- right now -- at your fingertips -- you know, spontaneously.
What are you talking about?
Excuse me?
Fun.
The cells in our bodies are always changing. In six or seven years all your cells have changed. You could be like a completely new person from the inside out.
That what's happening to you, only faster?
Stand right here.
Where?
You're acting like a crazy person.
You're straddling the state line. You're in two places at once.
It's places like this that make me certain there's a God.
You're sometimes not sure?
You're sometimes not sure?
I'm sure. Pretty sure.
We can measure wind.
Uncertainty makes you uncomfortable.
Uncertainty makes you uncomfortable.
What do you actually know with religion?
What do you actually know with religion?
Wonder. Beauty. Joy. Love.
I don't understand...
Maybe you're not supposed to.
I might do it wrong.
Not possible.
You make me feel...
Loved?
Loved?
That. And less strange.
Assholes. This happen to you?
Twice a year.
What's wr--?
The Challenger exploded. Principal Kelly's about to make an announcement.
Come on.
Where?
Where?
Away from here.
How do you know this place?
Before the divorce. My father used to take me here. Fire spotting was his summer job.
From here he proved to me the earth isn't flat. On rainy days, we'd be above the clouds.
What would you do up here?
What would you do up here?
Look. Talk. Not talk.
What'd you tell your father?
The truth. I just left you out of it.
When did you build this?
I was twelve.
It's an alt-azimuth design with one parabolic mirror and one secondary flat one.
Where's the one you're building?
Where's the one you're building?
In my back yard. I lied before. It's hardly started. But when it's done, it will have twice the power of this one --
So what do you want to see?
Mars.
Mars.
Mars doesn't rise until 2:30
A Thermos of hot coffee. A blanket. Socks.
You planned this --
You planned this --
Hoped for it.
Are you trying to seduce me?
No. Why? Are you seducible?
Ergo?
What about your father?
What about your father?
I'm always home by midnight and he's always asleep.
What's the best thing I can see tonight?
Me.
Can you locate XXI5639I?
Sure.
Here. Why am I looking at this star?
Because I had it named for you. I know it's not an official designation --
From citizen high to citizen low.
I don't care.
I don't care.
Care, but just don't let it get to you. It gives them power.
Care, but just don't let it get to you. It gives them power.
That what you do?
That what you do?
Yes. I try to keep my power.
One of your secrets.
Yes, one of many.
You're worried about your college applications.
I'm not applying to college.
You're going to take a year off? Join the Peace Corps -- ?
No.
No.
What are you going to -- ?
What are you going to -- ?
Pull over.
Pull over.
Where? Why?
Jamie --
I'm sick.
I'm sick.
Then I'll take you home. You'll feel better tomorrow.
Why didn't you tell me?
The doctors said to do everything the same as long as possible. I didn't want anyone being -- weird around me.
I'm so sorry. I'm a coward --
I should have told you sooner --
I should have told you sooner --
I made you do too many things, kept you up all night --
I made you do too many things, kept you up all night --
No. The drugs just stopped working. If anything, doing things I love kept me healthy longer.
Are you frightened?
All the time. I feel like I have no one.
Help me live until I die?
I will.
Nope.
Anything you want.
Anything you want.
Nothing.
Slim Jim? Apple? Yogurt? You like yogurt.
I used to like yogurt.
What are you thinking?
That I want you to take me home.
That I want you to take me home.
Now? We just --
Now? We just --
I don't want to come here anymore.
I've talked to your father.
That's what I mean.
Whatever you need. Whatever Jamie needs. I'm here. I could start by driving her to school --
I'm not going back to school.
You know how to waltz??
I was going to fake it.
How you doing?
Tired.
'What is a friend? A single soul dwelling in two bodies.' Aristotle.
Lower. Same page.
Lower. Same page.
'Find out who you are and do it on purpose.' Dolly Parton.
'Love is always patient and kind. It is never boastful or conceited -- '
That was read at my parents' wedding.
How're you doing?
Better. I was really angry.
It's gone now.
Because you have hope that you'll get better?
Because you have hope that you'll get better?
No. Maybe I believe God has a bigger dream for me than I had for myself. Maybe I believe the journey, the big adventure, never ends...
I'll talk to your father.
It's not that simple. It costs money to do this at home.
Can I -- go out?
You'll be fine for a few minutes.
Will you do something for me?
Landon. I can't even do for myself.
Landon. I can't even do for myself.
But if you could, you would?
But if you could, you would?
Yes.
The Carter boy. Tell me about him.
He wants help with his lines --
By accident --
Jamie, he's careless. Reckless. Is this really the best time to be making a new friend...?
Jamie, he's careless. Reckless. Is this really the best time to be making a new friend...?
I'm supposed to always be alone?
I'm supposed to always be alone?
I don't want you to see him outside school activities.
I don't want you to see him outside school activities.
Fine. But I need to start deciding how to spend my time and my life.
I'm sorry your mother isn't here to help you become a woman.
Dad, I've become a woman without her. Just not a pretty one.
What's Landon Carter up to?
Up to?
Up to?
I thought we had rid ourselves of his disagreeable companionship.
Did you give him a gift?
No.
No.
I saw the way he looked at you. The way he kissed you.
I saw the way he looked at you. The way he kissed you.
It was a play.
It was a play.
Boys like him have -- expectations.
Boys like him have -- expectations.
I have expectations, too.
I'm asking how much.
Dad --
Dad --
It's time to tell him. It would be the right thing.
Maybe. But that's not the real reason. You think if I tell, he'll disappear and that's what you want! Me all to yourself!
No. I want what's best for you.
No. I want what's best for you.
This -- him -- Landon -- is what's best for me!
No you didn't. But he did change. Just not enough.
Jamie, you're not mad at me. You're mad at Landon --
Jamie, you're not mad at me. You're mad at Landon --
I am mad at you! And at Landon! And the universe! And God! I don't even know where to put all my anger.
I am mad at you! And at Landon! And the universe! And God! I don't even know where to put all my anger.
That's normal. God accepts your anger. He won't punish you.
That's normal. God accepts your anger. He won't punish you.
By making me ill, he is punishing me! I just don't know what for.
When Mom died you told me God wanted her more, loved her more --
I was wrong. Nobody could have wanted or loved your mother more than we did. Not even God.
You're in the play?
Lead man.
Apropos of nothing... so. So so so so --
Let's get something straight. You don't know me. I don't know you. But I know what you're about. Keep your distance from this house -- and from Jamie.
Reverend Sullivan. Can I ask you something?
Does it have to do with Jamie?
Does it have to do with Jamie?
Yes, sir.
I'd like to take Jamie to dinner on New Year's Eve.
That won't be possible.
I care for her.
I don't want to see her hurt.
This week.
Ever again.
Landon. You're not the quiet type.
No.
No.
So talk to us about something.
So talk to us about something.
Like what, sir?
Like what, sir?
You decide.
How about your family?
Okay. Sure. My grandfather. When he was seven, he shook the hand of an old guy, a war vet or something, who had once shaken President Lincoln's hand. Made a big impression on him.
We didn't tell him any different for years --
Your parents are divorced?
Your parents are divorced?
Since I was five. My mom's a cocktail waitress.
Since I was five. My mom's a cocktail waitress.
How do you -- the two of you -- get by?
How do you -- the two of you -- get by?
Materially or spiritually?
Materially or spiritually?
Either. Both.
It's her decision and she's decided not to tell people -- at least for now.
How -- how long does she have?
Her doctors have. Jamie and I. We're still praying for a miracle.
Praying.
Praying.
Landon. We've lived with this for over a year now and --
Landon. We've lived with this for over a year now and --
If there is a God, how could he let this happen??!!
Landon. You go on home.
I'm not tired.
I'm not tired.
I need to be with her.
I've almost finished the rocker. Did she order mirrors?
In there.
You have materials for the side bearings?
I'm using an old phonographic turntable.
I'm using an old phonographic turntable.
For the focuser?
You know about this stuff?
I helped Jamie with the first one.
I helped Jamie with the first one.
I thought she built it herself.
I thought she built it herself.
She did. But hardly anyone does anything truly alone.
You've been well?
Yes. You?
Yes. You?
Getting by.
You're marrying again.
Yes.
Yes.
Jamie wanted that. She told me.
I'm sorry she never got her miracle.
She did. It was you.
Like you'd make it to June. Even cutting half your classes, you have a B- average.
I'm no dummy.
I'm no dummy.
That's right. You just act like one.
Now I can do what I want.
That's right. The world is your oyster.
Finding the real world to your liking, Mr. Carter?
I want to come back.
You could grace our hallowed halls again, if, while you're here, you make a sincere effort to be part of our little school community --
I'd do that --
I'd do that --
How would you do that, Mr. Carter?
Shall I give you a few ideas?
Please.
Please.
Besides attending all your regular classes, I'd like you to help our janitorial staff after school --

When do I get time for me?
When do I get time for me?
You don't. That's the point.
Landon, none of us faculty see you the way you see yourself. Some of us remember how your father --
Then you remember more than I do.
No way. No thanks. I can't do it --
-- You can and you will, Mr. Carter.
For Jefferson High. For books.
Where did you get -- ?
Where did you get -- ?
It's mine to give. I didn't steal it.
It's mine to give. I didn't steal it.
I didn't say you did.
Your grades for fall semester. They're -- good.
You came here to give me my report card?
You came here to give me my report card?
I've seen students with records like yours go to J.C. for a couple of years, then transfer to a good college.
I'd gladly write you a letter of recommendation.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Am I at the same angle to you and the basket as before?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Are you?
So what did we just make?
A similar triangle?

What else? What kind of triangle has three sides of different lengths.

Okay. Make me an isosceles.
Well, well, he smirked when Marty opened the door. If it isn't the neighborhood bootlegger, Al Capone McFly?
What do you want, Biff?

Show me some respect, you little asshole. It's Special Officer Tannen to you.
Show me some respect, you little asshole. It's Special Officer Tannen to you.
The day I show respect to Biff Tannen will be the day I win a million dollars... What's the matter, Biff, they're not showing you any respect down at the golf course? Don't they realize what a tough job it is keeping the criminal element away from the country club?

Marty. What's for breakfast?
Gimme some chili, fries, and a Tab.
Hot tip, Rubber Biscuit in the third race at Arlington.
Dick, what's with those guys out there in the gutter?
Dick, what's with those guys out there in the gutter?
Third time they've been out there this week.
What's N.R.C.?
I don't know. National Cash Register?
I've been calling you for five minutes! Didn't you hear me?
I was practicing. I've got an audition next week -- I gotta practice. How am I gonna get famous if I don't practice?
How was school today?
Fine.
Fine.
Learn anything?
Learn anything?
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.
That's good.
You mean you're going to stay up all night?
Mom, how else are we gonna see the sunrise?
Mom, how else are we gonna see the sunrise?
I don't think I like the idea of you staying out all night with a girl!
How old are you?
Seventeen.
Here's your jacket!
Uh, thanks...
It's polyester.
Poly-what?
Huh?
Have we ever met before?
Hi, Marty.
Uh, hi....
You remember me...?
How could I forget? Oh, sure, I remember you.
How could I forget? Oh, sure, I remember you.
Well, I was on my way to school, and I just wanted to stop by and see if you were feeling okay. You seemed like you were in pretty bad shape the other night.
Well, I was on my way to school, and I just wanted to stop by and see if you were feeling okay. You seemed like you were in pretty bad shape the other night.
Oh, I'm feeling much better now.
Then you'll be going to school here....?
School? I never thought of school! If I went to school I could blend in with everybody else, couldn't I?
What time does school start around here?
Nine o' clock. Oh, I'm late! Maybe I'll see you later.
Nine o' clock. Oh, I'm late! Maybe I'll see you later.
Yeah. Maybe so.
George! He's supposed to ask you to the dance!
But he didn't ask me.
But he didn't ask me.
But he does! Don't you see?
He comes out of the cafeteria line, he's nervous, he spills his corn, and he asks you to the dance!
Marty, you haven't been listening. Nobody's asked me to the dance...yet.
Hi, Marty!
Listen, Professor Brown told me you called last night and gave me your message...
Are you all right, Marty? You seem a little...nervous.
Oh, no, I'm fine...fine.
I'm usually nervous myself on first dates...but not tonight. It's funny, but somehow, I feel like....like I know you.
Uh, yeah, well, believe me, I sure feel like I know you!
Well, Eileen...jeez, that's hard for me to say. Have you ever been in a situation where -- well -- you know you have to act a certain way, but when you get there, you don't know if you can go through with it?
You mean like how you're supposed to act with someone on a first date?
I think I know exactly what you mean.
You do?
Now, George! Dinner's ready now!
Coming, Eileen...
By the way, that reminds me... Saturday night we're taking Grandma Stella out for Chinese food.
Eileen, Chinese food again?
Eileen, Chinese food again?
George, if you don't want Chinese food, pick a place you want to go and make a reservation.
Is that what you were going to ask me, George? To go to the dance?
No!
Uh, hi, Eileen.
How are you?
How are you?
Oh -- I'm all right. Say, listen, about this dance Saturday night --
Dad, you seen the drill?
What drill?
What drill?
The drill! The power drill I bought you for Christmas. I was using it last night.
Fine..
Learn anything?
Learn anything?
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.
Good.
No, Chinese food is fine.
Saturday night's the 'Springtime in Paris' dance. I'm taking Suzy Parker.
The sunrise? What for?
Jeez, what do you think? To see it!
You've gotta ask her to the dance!
Not now....
George, she's beautiful, right? She's nice, she's decent, she's the kind of girl you'd like to marry, right? And there's nothing in the world you'd like more than to take her to that dance, right?
Well... yeah...
Well... yeah...
Okay, then!
What do I say?
Say what you were supposed to say in the cafeteria.
Oh, no! That was for the cafeteria! This is different!
Christ, it's a miracle I was even born!
Christ, it's a miracle I was even born!
Huh?
Huh?
Nothing. Look, I'll write it down for you, okay?
What is that? A pencil that writes in ink?
It was Marty's turn to be confused. Huh?
It was Marty's turn to be confused. Huh?
Lemme see that.
'Bike fine point?'
Bic... It's a Bic pen.
I don't want to hit you in the stomach!
You're not gonna hurt me. Just hit me in the stomach.
You're not gonna hurt me. Just hit me in the stomach.
Look, Marty, I'm just not a fighter...
How many times do I have to explain it to you?... We know you're not a fighter. You know it, I know it... but she doesn't know it. That's why we gotta make you look like a fighter, somebody who'll stand up for her, somebody who isn't chicken. And you're not gonna look like a fighter if you can't hit me in the stomach.
But I've never picked a fight in my entire life!
But I've never picked a fight in my entire life!
You're not picking a fight, you're coming to her rescue. Maybe we'd better go over the plan again. Where are you gonna be at 8:55?
You're not picking a fight, you're coming to her rescue. Maybe we'd better go over the plan again. Where are you gonna be at 8:55?
I'm going to be at the dance.
I'm going to be at the dance.
And where am I gonna be?
And where am I gonna be?
In the parking lot, with her.
Okay. So right around 9:00 she's gonna get very angry with me -
Why?
Why?
Why what?
Why what?
Why is she gonna get angry with you?
You mean, you're gonna --
George it's not your concern. Don't worry about it. Just remember that at 9:00, you'll be strolling through the parking lot and you'll see us -- struggling in the car, you'll run over, open the door and say....?
Your line, George!
Oh. Uh... 'Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!' George paused. You really think I should swear?
Oh. Uh... 'Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!' George paused. You really think I should swear?
Yes, definitely, god dammit George, swear. Then you hit me in the stomach, I go down for the count, and you and Eileen life happily ever after. Now, hit me in the stomach.
Maybe if I used my left....
No, George, just concentrate on the anger. Anger.
You'd like to see a nuclear holocaust?
Not a holocaust --
Not a holocaust --
Mr. McFly here wants to nuke it all, just so he can see it!
You know damn well that's not what I meant.
All I can say is, that's one helluva attitude, Mr. McFly. 'Let's explode a hundred megaton Geothermal nuclear device, just to see it.'
Yeah, explode it up your ass!
Unfortunately, the way things are going, you may get your wish. You may see the entire annhiliation of the world. If not, you'll certainly see the destruction of all out natural resources. We can already see the air we breathe, not to mention the pollution in our rivers and lakes. We'll see all of our oil reserves depleted, in fact, all of our energy

We can already see the air we breathe, not to mention the pollution in our rivers and lakes. We'll see all of our oil reserves depleted, in fact, all of our energy
Hey, Mr. Arky, gimme a break! I'm seventeen years old! I'm not responsible for all these problems!
Yes, that's my name. Who are you, young man? Are you supposed to be here?
Uh -- yeah. I'm new here, and I'm supposed to be in this class.
You have a name?
Marty. Marty Lewis.
Who, me?
You're the only Mr. Lewis in this class. If you have something to say, say it so the whole class can hear.

Well, yeah, I was thinking, if cars are gonna be going two or three hundred miles an hour, they're gonna be using an awful lot of gas. Like, what if we run out?
Well, yeah, I was thinking, if cars are gonna be going two or three hundred miles an hour, they're gonna be using an awful lot of gas. Like, what if we run out?
Run out of gas?
Operator...
Operator! Listen, this is an emergency! I have to make this call, but I don't have a dime -- all I got is a nickel -- but you gotta connect me --
Operator! Listen, this is an emergency! I have to make this call, but I don't have a dime -- all I got is a nickel -- but you gotta connect me --
Sir, it only costs a nickel.
Sir, it only costs a nickel.
What?
What?
Local calls cost five cents. What number do you want?
Oh -- right! Uh, Madison 3489.
Five cents, please.
I'm sorry, there's no answer.
Operator, what's today's date?
Operator, what's today's date?
March 11th.
March 11th.
What year?
What year?
Nineteen fifty --
Good evening, one said. Agents Reese and Foley, from the Nuclear Regulatory Commition. Mind stepping over here?
What's this all about?
What, am I radioactive or something?
No, no, not beyond an acceptable level. Have you been X-rayed recently, Martin?
Been any place unusual in the past twelve hours?
Home, school, here...
Okay, Martin. You have a good evening now.
Yeah, Right.
What?!
Pro! Release the rope!
Professor Brown! It's almost eight thirty -- I'm outta here!
Shhhhhhhh!
The power of a million hydrogen bombs! ...and we get twenty four measly volts. It's not fair! I've been working on this power converter since 1949, and you'd think in all that time, I could find the right chemicals that would efficiently convert radiation into electric energy! But no! Thirty three years of dedication and research, and all I've got to show for it
That reminds me, if we could scrape up enough for a 35 film chain, I've got a connection with a projectionist in a first run house -- we could be sellin' new movies on the street before they're even in the theater.

A 35mm film chain... I'll see what I can do....
Did you ever consider that some doors are locked for a reason?
Nope. The way I figure it, doors are made to be opened. See you after school.
Nope. The way I figure it, doors are made to be opened. See you after school.
Oh -- Marty -- what time did you say it was?
Eight thirty.
AM or PM?
AM or PM?
Pro, the sun's out!
Pro, the sun's out!
Oh, right, right...
Oh, right, right...
Jeez, for a guy with a ton of clocks, you sure don't pay much attention to time.
Catch you later!
...To be traveled through
But Professor --
Get behind the shield! I'm about to release radiation!
No, Marty. Shemp's molecular structure is completely intact!
Then where the hell is he?
Then where the hell is he?
The appropriate question to ask is when the hell is he! You see, Shemp has just become the world's first time traveller. I've sent Shemp into the future -- two minutes into the future to be exact.

The future? What are you talking about? Where's Shemp?!
The future? What are you talking about? Where's Shemp?!
Shemp is right here in this room...two minutes from now, and at exactly 9:02PM, we'll catch up to him.
Shemp is right here in this room...two minutes from now, and at exactly 9:02PM, we'll catch up to him.
Now hold on a minute, Professor! Hold the phone. Are you trying to tell me that this -- all of this here -- that this is -- it's a -- a --
A time machine! Because of that Coke?!
Precisely!
The plutonium! That's what I came over here for! Professor, where did you get that stuff?
Why?
Exactly two minutes difference... and it's still ticking!
Is Shemp all right?
Of course. Shemp is unaware that anything even happened, other than his stool suddenly falling over. We had to wait two minutes to catch up to him, but for Shemp the trip was instantaneous.
Professor, can this thing send Shemp back in time?
A gold mine?
Sure! Listen -- we take the racing results from today's paper...
Marty, that would alter history.
So what? We'd be rich!
So what? We'd be rich!
Don't you understand? The mere act of sending matter back in time would change the course of events, and changing history is a responsibility that I do not wish to bear.
All I know is you're throwing away an awful lot of money.
The future, Marty, the future is everything! I built this machine to see the future. So I am going to send Shemp twenty-four hours into the future. You can assist me, if you like.
The future, Marty, the future is everything! I built this machine to see the future. So I am going to send Shemp twenty-four hours into the future. You can assist me, if you like.
Sure, he agreed quickly.
Professor? Professor Brown?
You know me?
Professor, you time machine works! It works! It sent me back in time! I'm from 1982!
Ssshhhhh!
He will be. Simple inebriation, is all. The young man must have a rather low tolerance for alcohol... something that runs in the family. You see, he's a second cousin of mine on my mother's side. Came quite a distance to visit me, he added. His name's Lewis.
Marty.
Marty.
Uh, Marty Lewis! I almost didn't recognize him -- haven't seen him in years.
Jeez -- this is where you used to live, huh? You must have been rich!
Must have been? Used to live? I do live here.
Must have been? Used to live? I do live here.
Oh, yeah.
Well, there's a mall here now -- I mean, there will be.
A mall?
A mall?
Yeah, a shopping mall. You know, a shopping mall?
You've convinced me that you must be who you say you are. No living human has ever seen this machine. But why? Why even in my twilight years would I remotely consider sending someone back in time?
You didn't, Professor. It was an accident! You see, what happened --
You didn't, Professor. It was an accident! You see, what happened --
No! Don't tell me! I don't want to know the future! My knowledge of future events... your mere presence here... could have devastating effects on the course of history. And altering history is a responsibility that I do not wish to bear. My immediate response is to send you back to your own time.
Pardon me?
Oh. That expression probably hasn't been invented yet... I can get behind -- I agree with you.
On second thought, there may be some things you'll have to tell me.
The power converter...
The power converter...
Of course! The power converter! It works! Of course, it works... What chemicals do we use?
Well, Professor, are you sure you want me to tell you? You know, changing the course of history and all....
Blast it -- no, I suppose you're right.... You do know the proper chemical formula?
How did you know?
Just a guess. I figured kids would still be drinking Coke in 1982.
Professor. Well, not exactly, Professor. You see, we don't point it at the sun.
We don't....
4200 rads... That certainly can't be generated under controlled conditions in this day and age.
That's just great!
You answered the door!
You were ringing the doorbell!
I told you not to interfere with any of the events of this time! Nobody's supposed to see you here! What if I was a mailman? Or a salesman?
What if you lost your keys?
What if you lost your keys?
Then I would have figured out to get back in through the events in the natural course of history! Don't you understand? The fabric of history is very delicate. Anything you do could have serious consequences!
Then I would have figured out to get back in through the events in the natural course of history! Don't you understand? The fabric of history is very delicate. Anything you do could have serious consequences!
Hey, look, gimme a break! All I did was answer the door! How's that gonna change history?
Hey, look, gimme a break! All I did was answer the door! How's that gonna change history?
I don't know, but I don't want to take any chances! Now you stay here and don't do anything. Don't answer the door, don't answer the phone, don't go outside. Understand?
Let me put it on a level you can understand. You don't belong here. You don't know anything about this world. You don't know the customs, you don't know how to talk, how to act -- you don't even look like you belong here. And if you walked out on the street, you wouldn't get 100 yards without being arrested. Then there would be
Okay, Professor, I get where you're coming from. The way I look, the way I'm dressed... I'd stick out like a sore thumb.
An atomic bomb.
Professor, be serious, would you?
Professor, be serious, would you?
I am serious. If we could get you, the time machine, and the power converter in the vicinity of an atomic blast, we could send you back to the future.
I am serious. If we could get you, the time machine, and the power converter in the vicinity of an atomic blast, we could send you back to the future.
You're talking crazy! An atomic blast would melt me and the time machine in a matter of seconds!
You're talking crazy! An atomic blast would melt me and the time machine in a matter of seconds!
You forget -- time travel is instantaneous. The time machine would melt, but you would have already travelled through time. Of course, it's a moot point regardless. The only place atomic bombs are detonated is at the Army's Nevada Test Site, and those tests are kept absolutely top secret.
Say, where did this guitar come from?
Oh -- that -- I found it in the closet.
Oh -- that -- I found it in the closet.
I don't recall ever seeing it before.
I don't recall ever seeing it before.
Well, it was there.
Well, it was there.
Curious... Very curious....
I know.
You did what?!?
Look, it's not a big deal! I can fix it! All I gotta do is get 'em together and make sure my old man asks her out!
You better make sure your old man asks her out, because if he doesn't, they may never have a first date. And if they don't have a first date, they won't have a second date. If they don't have a second date, they won't fall in love. If they don't fall in love, they won't get married, and if they don't get married, you'll
Where did you get this?
I brought it with me from 1982. It's from my science book.
The test is this Monday! 15 megatons... Let's see, we need 4200 rads... You'd have to be...exactly 800 yards from ground zero... You realize that what we're going to do could be extremely dangerous.
Believe me, Professor, running around on a nuclear test site can't be any more dangerous than what I've been doing.
Your 'mother' wanted me to tell you that she was very impressed by what you did this afternoon, and that if you were interested in going to the dance Saturday, she's available.
But that's impossible!! George asked her out! He had to! I saw him walk her home! Oh, God!
But that's impossible!! George asked her out! He had to! I saw him walk her home! Oh, God!
My guess is that she turned him down.
My guess is that she turned him down.
But why? Why would she do that? She's supposed to marry the guy!

Apparently, what has happened is that the maternal instinct has transcended the gap of time and this has caused an alteration in your mother's emotional behavior.

Are you trying to tell me that my mother's got the hots for me?
In a manner of speaking, yes. And because of that, she's no longer interested in your father.
Jesus!
That's all taken care of.
Good. Professor Brown tested the tarp, noting in satisfaction that it was secure. I'll pick you up in front of the school at midnight. Don't be late -- we're cutting it close as it is. We've got a long drive ahead of us.
Look. I'm a little worried about this -- this whole thing with my mother, he admitted to the Professor. I mean, I don't know if I can do it -- I mean, hitting on my own mother, that's pretty heavy.
Nobody said anything about hitting her! You're just going to take a few liberties with her.
Nobody said anything about hitting her! You're just going to take a few liberties with her.
That's exactly what I said! I mean, a guy and his mother -- that's illegal, isn't it?
That's exactly what I said! I mean, a guy and his mother -- that's illegal, isn't it?
Look, Marty, she's not your mother yet. And if you don't go through with this, she may never be. I know it's hard, but there are some things we must do in life that are unpleasant. Some choices must be made that are difficult. Nonetheless, we must make them. Besides, this may be more than a simple question of your own existence, he added.

That's just what I needed to hear.
That's just what I needed to hear.
It'll be fine, Marty. You'll be fine. Good luck. He stuck his hand out and Marty shook it. But there was still a question that was nagging at him...
It'll be fine, Marty. You'll be fine. Good luck. He stuck his hand out and Marty shook it. But there was still a question that was nagging at him...
Professor, if something does go wrong tonight... if I don't get my parents back together... when do you think I'd cease to exist?
There's no way of knowing.
Perfect...
Perfect...
It could happen at the moment you arrive back in the future, theoretically, it could happen at the moment of your birth...or conception. Actually, it could happen at any time. It's a question to which I hope we'll never learn the answer.
You didn't?
Nope. My father's never clenched a fist in his entire life!
Nope. My father's never clenched a fist in his entire life!
Curious... Very curious.
It was sure nice of Uncle Sam to put those yardage markers up for us.
We're at one and a half miles, so you're just a little over a mile from where you want to be, Wait until minus 3 minutes before you go -- that should give you plenty of time, and it should be close enough to zero hour that they can't do anything to stop you. Park the truck at 800 and get in the refri--
Thanks for everything, Pro.
Professor Brown grinned. I guess I'll see you in... about 30 years.
Marty, I know I've repeatedly asked you not to tell me anything about the future, but....well, those loud bangs on the tape recorder....are they....
Professor -- there are some doors that shouldn't be opened, Marty said softly, without turning around.
What year is this?
1982! March 18, just like we planned! My calculations were absolutely correct! Thirty years! God, I cannot believe it's been thirty years! Sure, it was a long time ago -- longest I've ever had to wait for the results of an experiment!
Hop in, Marty, . We've got a long drive ahead of us.
What do you call this?
What do you call this?
A car.
You see, I never rebuilt the time machine after it was destroyed in 1952. I decided that experimenting with time and possibly changing history was too risky. Anyway, experiments in time travel were banned in all 87 states after the governor of Cuba caught Dr. Felstien fooling around in the Bermuda Triangle -- that was back in '64.
87 states? Time travel bans? What the hell?
But if you didn't rebuild the time machine, how did I go back in time in the first place?
According to your girlfriend, Suzy Parker, you and she were at the movies. You went to the restroom and you never came out. Obviously, you stepped through an inter-dimensional time warp, created by the original operation of the time machine.
Obviously!
But I told everyone your disappearance was due to a teleportation experiment you were helping me with. So don't mention anything about time travel to anyone.

What theater was I at?
What theater was I at?
The Orpheum.
Pretty, isn't it?
It's the most beautiful city I've ever seen! What is it?
Uh, yeah... Gimme a Tab.
What?
What?
A Tab.
Sweet and what? Maybe you'd better pay for this first.
Sure,.
Look, maybe I'd better talk to Dick. Is he around?
Dick? Dick who?
Dick? Dick who?
Now who's being stupid? The guy who runs this place.
Now who's being stupid? The guy who runs this place.
I run this place!
I run this place!
What happened to Dick Wilson?
What happened to Dick Wilson?
Dick Wilson? Dickie Wilson? Dickie Wilson runs this place? That's a laugh!
...He just lets himself get pushed around all the time! People walk all over him and he never fights back, never stands up for himself.
No self confidence, I guess... At least you don't take after him.
No self confidence, I guess... At least you don't take after him.
Yeah... Jesus! I wonder how he ever got up enough nerve to marry my mom.
Can you imagine your parents in bed together?
No way!
No way!
Me neither. I've always wondered whether they slept together before they got married. You think yours did?
Me neither. I've always wondered whether they slept together before they got married. You think yours did?
Hell no! The way my mom carries on about sex -- you even mention the word and she goes into cardiac arrest. You shoulda seen her face when I told her we were gonna stay up all night Saturday, he added. Always afraid something is going to happen.

Is something going to happen Saturday night?
Suzy!
Hi, Marty!
Hi, Marty!
What did you do to your hair?
What did you do to your hair?
What did you do to yours?
Hi. where's Cato?
Well, he's gone.
Well, he's gone.
Gone?... Where?
Gone?... Where?
He said not to tell.
He said not to tell.
Oh yeah?
Oh yeah?
Yeah, he said for you to give us a lift into town. You're the ones with the Studebaker, aren't you?
No... You go in there, I'll have to kill you.
What's going on?
What's going on?
Can't afford to take chances.
Nah, skip that... I'm going to have to keep an eye on you, though.
Okay.
Okay.
You don't mind?
You promise to stay down there for an hour?
Yeah.
Yeah.
You expect me to believe that?
Catch!
What do you mean?
How you doing, Cato?
Not bad.
What you been doing?
Running this place for a fella in town. Nothing much to speak of.
Running this place for a fella in town. Nothing much to speak of.
Well, I don't notice us hustling trash, either.
Where'd you get them antlers?
They come with the house.
Yeah, I guess.
She plays the clarinet, too.
That's what he told you, huh?
No, he showed me one.
Kit... Maybe I'd better get a shovel.
Okay.
Okay.
I'll catch up with you.
I'll catch up with you.
Okay.
Don't you ever get bored around here?
Sometimes. The other day, though, an old boy was plowing in the field over there, found some old Spanish coins.
What'd they look like?
Kind of round, like so... Gold. I'll show you if you want.
That your spider in there? In that bottle?
Yeah.
Yeah.
What do you feed him?
What do you feed him?
Oh, flies... grasshoppers when I can catch 'em.
Oh, flies... grasshoppers when I can catch 'em.
Does he bite?
Does he bite?
He never bit me.
You ever held another job before?
I used to throw trash for the City.
I used to throw trash for the City.
You lost that one?

Wouldn't be here if I hadn't.
Wouldn't be here if I hadn't.
What kind of work do you think you would be qualified for?
What kind of work do you think you would be qualified for?
I can't think of anything at the moment... I'd like you to write me out a slip, though, proving I came down here.
Oh yeah?
Long as my ammo held out... Right there's where you caught me.
We did it, Ray.
You better not leave that Cadillac sitting out here.
Say, what kind of rifle was that you were shooting at me?
Thirty aught six.
Thirty aught six.
You ever had to open it up like that before?
You ever had to open it up like that before?
Nope.
Kit... Kit, I've got a question for you.
Mmmmm.
Mmmmm.
You like people?
You like people?
They're okay.
They're okay.
Then why'd you do it?
Then why'd you do it?
I don't know. Always wanted to be a criminal, I guess. Just not this big a one... Takes all kinds though.
Hey, listen, Tom, I don't mean to tell you how to run your show here but these cuffs are pinching. What do you say now?
I need to get your signature on some papers here, Kit.
I need to get your signature on some papers here, Kit.
Well, I've got to read them first. Suppose I could get a Coke while I do?
Well, I've got to read them first. Suppose I could get a Coke while I do?
Sure thing. Come on.
Holly's over here, Kit, if you want to see her.
Sure.
Well, Kit...
Tom...
Tom...
Good luck to you.
Good luck to you.
Thanks.
Thanks.
I mean it.
I mean it.
I know you do. Good luck to you, too.
Sure is pretty.
What'd you come out here for?
What'd you come out here for?
I wasn't aware there was any law against it.
You know, before I met her, nobody could ask me how I was doing with my girl. Matter of fact, I didn't really have one.
Is that right?
Is that right?
Yeah.
Listen. I got a lot of respect for her, sir. That's about as good a one as I know to tell you.
Well, it's not good enough. Just what do you think would happen to her if she stuck around with you, Kit? Guy like you.
Well, it's not good enough. Just what do you think would happen to her if she stuck around with you, Kit? Guy like you.
She'd get along okay. And if she didn't, well, she could take off, just take off, I wouldn't mind... I'd always tell people I deserved it.
Hi.
What're you doing?
What're you doing?
I've got a gun here, sir. It's always a good idea to have one around.
What do you think you're doing? Go on, get out of here.
Well, I got it all planned... and I'm taking Holly off with me.
What for?
For coming onto my property... With a gun.
For coming onto my property... With a gun.
No, you're not either.
No, you're not either.
Yeah? Why not?
Yeah? Why not?
Cause I can't allow it.
What's going to happen to Jack and me?
You have to ask Kit. He says frog, I jump.
You have to ask Kit. He says frog, I jump.
Okay.
Okay.
What's your friend's name?
What's your friend's name?
Jack.
Jack.
You love him?
You love him?
I don't know.
I've got to stick by Kit... He feels trapped.
Yeah. I can imagine.
Yeah. I can imagine.
Well, I've felt that way, hadn't you?
Hi, I'm Kit. I'm not keeping you from anything important, am I?
No.
No.
Well, I was just messing around over there, thought I'd come over and say hello to you. I'll try anything once. What's your name? I said mine.
Well, I was just messing around over there, thought I'd come over and say hello to you. I'll try anything once. What's your name? I said mine.
Holly.
Holly.
Listen, Holly, you want to take a walk with me?
Listen, Holly, you want to take a walk with me?
What for?
What for?
Well. I got some stuff to say. Guess I'm kind of lucky that way. Most people don't have anything on their minds, do they?
Oh, incidentally, my last name is Carruthers. Sounds a little too much like "druthers", doesn't it?
It's okay.
It's okay.
Well, nobody asked me what I thought. They just hung it on me.
You still in school?
Nah, I got me a job.
Nah, I got me a job.
Doing what?
Doing what?
Well, I don't mind getting up early, so I got a job throwing garbage... I'm not in love with the stuff, okay.
That's my father. I got to run.
Hey, wait a minute. When am I going to see you again?
Well, I know what my daddy's going to say.
What?
What?
Can I be honest?
Can I be honest?
Sure.
Sure.
Well, that I shouldn't be seen with anybody that collects garbage.
Well, that I shouldn't be seen with anybody that collects garbage.
He'll say that?
He'll say that?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Now what's he know about garbage, huh?
Now what's he know about garbage, huh?
Nothing.
Nothing.
There you go.
There you go.
Well, I mean there's nothing he wants to know about it... I've got to run.
Hi.
Well, stop the world.
Well, stop the world.
Quit my job.
Quit my job.
Great.
Great.
Just seemed like the right move... Whatcha doing?
Just seemed like the right move... Whatcha doing?
Spanish.
Spanish.
How do you say "Quit my Job" in Spanish?
How do you say "Quit my Job" in Spanish?
Something mi trabajo.
Yeah, well, I'm going to work as a cowboy now... Or thinking about it. It's a routine, like anything. What do you think?
I don't know.
You want to go for a ride?
Well, I got homework.
Well, I got homework.
Bring it along.
You're a redhead.
I know.
I know.
Anybody ever call you "Red"?
Anybody ever call you "Red"?
Yeah, but I don't like it.
Yeah, but I don't like it.
Why not?
Why not?
Just don't... I've got a headache.
Just don't... I've got a headache.
Yeah?
Can I come around and see you tomorrow?
Okay.
What a nice place.
Yeah, the tree makes it nice.
Yeah, the tree makes it nice.
And the flowers... Let's not pick them. They're so nice.
And the flowers... Let's not pick them. They're so nice.
It's your play.
My stomach's growling.
There's an old Fudgesicle over there. You want it?
There's an old Fudgesicle over there. You want it?
No.
Somebody else is going to get it.
I don't care.
I don't care.
Kids eat that kind of stuff in Korea.
Did it go the way it 'uz supposed to?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Is that all there is to it?
Is that all there is to it?
Yeah.
Gosh, what was everybody talking about?
Don't ask me.
You know what I think?
What?
What?
That we should crunch our hands with this stone. That way we'd never forget what happened today.
That we should crunch our hands with this stone. That way we'd never forget what happened today.
But it would hurt.
But it would hurt.
Well, that's the point, stupid.
Don't call me stupid.
Okay, but I'm going to keep it for a souvenir...
I came in the front.
How bad off is he?
How bad off is he?
I can look and see.
I can look and see.
We better call the doctor... Listen. I'll say how it happened, part I saw.
We better call the doctor... Listen. I'll say how it happened, part I saw.
Well... I don't think that'd work.
Are you sure?
You don't believe me, see for yourself.
Listen, maybe we ought to tell somebody about this.
You said that once already... Too late now.
You said that once already... Too late now.
Why?
Why?
They're not going to listen to me. You either. Are you kidding?
Suppose the neighbors heard the noise?
Wouldn't be funny... Listen, I'll be back in a while.
How you doing?
I'm fine. Kind of tired.
I'm fine. Kind of tired.
Yeah, me too.
"The Kon-Tiki in motion was a little different from what it usually was in such conditions. We had become sensitive to changes in the rhythm of the logs. I thought at once of suction from the coast, which was drawing near, and was continually out on the deck and up the mast..."
He was nervous.
I found a lid. It was laying on the ground over there.
Put that down. It's dirty.
Look at all this junk.
How's he doing?
How's he doing?
I got him in the stomach.
Is he upset?
He didn't say anything to me about it.
Whatcha looking in there for? We can't afford any of that.
Just looking.
Think I got 'em?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Well, I'm not going down there and look.
What'd you put him in there for?
Just to keep him out of the sun.
You tired?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, you look tired... Listen, honey. when all this is over, I'm going to sit down and buy you a big, thick steak.
Yeah, you look tired... Listen, honey. when all this is over, I'm going to sit down and buy you a big, thick steak.
I don't want a steak.
I don't want a steak.
Well, we'll see about that... Hey, lookie.
Later we found out she was deaf and we hadn't even known it.
Excuse me.
Hey, why're you always walking ahead of me?
Well, why you always walking behind me?
Don't.
Anybody ever done that to you before?
Anybody ever done that to you before?
No.
No.
Positive?
Positive?
Yes.
Yes.
Guess there's no way I'll ever know. For sure.
I'd like to get out of here.
Soon as I start the car... and fix my hat.
"Rumor: Pat Boone is seriously considering giving up his career so he can return to school full-time and complete his education. Fact: Pat has told intimates that so long as things are going well for his career, it's the education that will have to take the back seat."
I don't blame him.
I don't blame him.
"Rumor: Frank Sinatra and Rita Hayworth are in love... Fact: True, but not with each other."
That's Montana over there.
I never been to Montana... Acquaintance of mine has, but I hadn't... Never had any reason to.
Why not? I mean, I'm having fun... At least I'm not bitching.
Well, I feel kind of like an animal living out here. I mean, there's no place to bathe and... no place to get anything good to eat.
Well, I feel kind of like an animal living out here. I mean, there's no place to bathe and... no place to get anything good to eat.
Well, I'll catch you a big trout. Soon as we get to the mountains.
Everybody loves trout.
I'm serious.
Maybe we should've tried to hop it.
It was going too fast.
It was going too fast.
I could've pulled the car up on the tracks, slowed it down some.
I could've pulled the car up on the tracks, slowed it down some.
Yeah, then we'd be stuck here.
Yeah, then we'd be stuck here.
Well, maybe we oughta be stuck here. I'm not saying that I know.
Well, maybe the slope here is throwing it off some. We ought to find a more flat place.
How about over here?
Never mind. It doesn't matter... If I'm worth a damn, I'll pick the right direction. And if I'm not, well, I don't care. See what I mean?
No.
No.
Well, I shouldn't expect miracles, should I?
What?
Nothing... I was just running off at the mouth... as usual.
Nothing... I was just running off at the mouth... as usual.
I'm sorry. I wasn't listening.
You know... they'd probably ask to see your driver's license before they hired you.
Well. I'm not going to let that stop me.
You smoke Pall Mall?
Yeah.
Boy. I had a feeling today was going to be the day... Helicopter.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He's not coming to take us for a ride, either. Come on, let's make a run for the car.
Have you got a better idea?
I just don't want to go.
I just don't want to go.
What?
Course it's too bad about your dad.
Yeah.
Yeah.
We're going to have to sit down, and talk about that sometime.
Hi.
Hi... ah, Mister Scarborough here?
Hi... ah, Mister Scarborough here?
Yeah, but the thing about him, he's down with the flu. He's sick.
Yeah, but the thing about him, he's down with the flu. He's sick.
Really?
Really?
Yeah. I'd invite you inside, except it's contagious. Don't want to start an epidemic.
Yeah. I'd invite you inside, except it's contagious. Don't want to start an epidemic.
No, of course not. It's only that he called last night and asked if I could come by.
No, of course not. It's only that he called last night and asked if I could come by.
Well, he didn't have it last night.
What's that?
Well, I'd like to leave a message, if that's okay.
Well, I'd like to leave a message, if that's okay.
Sure.
Hi.
Yes?
Yes?
This your place?
This your place?
Yes.
Sorry to barge in on you. Anybody else here besides you two?
No.
Good deal... Oh, uh, we're on the run and we'd like to hang out here for a while. Couple of hours, maybe. How'd that be?
Stay as long as you like.
Hi, whatcha doing?
Just thinking.
Just thinking.
Good a way to kill time as any... She okay?
Yes.
Listen, ah... We're going to take the Cadillac for a while. How'd that be?
Listen, ah... We're going to take the Cadillac for a while. How'd that be?
Fine.
Fine.
Don't worry, I won't let her drive.
You're my friend, aren't you?
Yes.
Yes.
Okay, no monkey business then.
Morning... Say, you got any gas?
Maybe.
Maybe.
Well. I'm sorry, sir, but we've got to ask you for it.
See, we're about out... been driving all night. Actually, I don't even have time to explain it to you.
Well, matter of fact, I don't have any.
Well, matter of fact, I don't have any.
Just a second now. That's your truck. isn't it?
You didn't walk out here.
It's mine all right.
It's mine all right.
Well, listen. I'm going to swap you my Cadillac.
Who are you?
Name is Carruthers. Believe I shoot people every now and then. Not that I deserve a medal.
Okay, friend. Start running.
Just gimme a chance.
Just gimme a chance.
Git.
Hi.
Hold it right there.
Hold it right there.
I could've held off an army if I could've gotten behind a rock in the mountains.
Think I'll take the juice?
Beats me.
You tossed my hat out the window.
Wanta sue me?
Wanta sue me?
No.
So we'll help. Let's get crackin'!
Who're you?
All these people applied for drivers' licenses in the same town in New Jersey on the exact same date.
New Jersey?
New Jersey?
Forty-six Yoyodyne employees. Grover's Mill, New Jersey, 11/1/38.
November 1, thirty days have September, April, June, and November...when short February's done, all the rest have thirty-one. October 31st! Halloween! Don't you get it? Orson Welles!
You mean the guy from the old wine commercials?
You mean the guy from the old wine commercials?
Halloween. 1938..."War of the Worlds"...that fake radio news broadcast that got everybody scared, thinking that real live Martians were landing in Grover's Mill, New Jersey! But then it all just turned out to be a hoax.
Halloween. 1938..."War of the Worlds"...that fake radio news broadcast that got everybody scared, thinking that real live Martians were landing in Grover's Mill, New Jersey! But then it all just turned out to be a hoax.
Then that's it!
Forgive the butterfingers, Buckaroo. Casper Lindley, Knight of the Blue Shield, at your disposal. And my son, Scooter.
Nothing to apologize for, Casper. You've gone beyond the call of duty tonight. Mind if I get on the horn and radio the Cavaliers--? They'll be worried.
She gotta be kiddin', right? Vaporize the whole damn planet--?
You wanna take the chance, Casper?
You wanna take the chance, Casper?
Not me. No way.
Not me. No way.
Rawhide, go find out how Professor Hikita's coming with that formula. Mrs. Johnson, take Casper and Scooter, gas up the Jet Car.
There's another one we owe 'em.
They're stealing my chopper!
See 'em? They about had me and the whole damn car for breakfast. Broke my windshield...
The creatures? They attacked you? They tried to possess you?
Smells fermented. Check in with the Institute, Reno, see if everything's kosher.
Buckaroo, I've done an advanced spectrograph analysis on the specimen you pulled off the Jet Car drive shaft.
Rawhide tells me Dr. Lizardo escaped...
I'm assigning a couple Blue Shields to protect you around the clock, just in case.
We at the Banzai Institute have at last found that way: an alternating gradient synchronizer that softens solid matter by attenuating its electroweak forces!
Which we all know are the forces that tend to pull objects part, right, professor?
Buckaroo! What the Sam Hill!
Careful...don't make noise and don't touch me. I'm hotter than flapjacks.
Careful...don't make noise and don't touch me. I'm hotter than flapjacks.
What?
What?
I'm a giant semi-conductor, and there's alien creatures all around us. Form the Eighth Dimension, I think. Look...
Ever since that phony phone call from the President. Look at this. What is it?
It's your hand, Buckaroo.
It's your hand, Buckaroo.
It's an antidote. A formula. Whoever it was on the phone made me scribble this and gave me the ability to penetrate their disguises.
Antidote to what? Whose disguises?
Arachtoids. From Planet Ten.
Arachtoids. From Planet Ten.
Planet 10?
Planet 10?
There's a Harley behind those bushes. Get back to the laboratory and start working on the formula. We don't have time to ask questions. Just synthesize it-
I'm starving...somebody, help.
Got a half a tuna sandwich.
Got a half a tuna sandwich.
Same one you had yesterday?
Then what?
Vanished. Thin air.
Dr. Lizardo's a raving lunatic, Perfect Tommy, a vicious psychopath with crazy eyes and flaming orange hair that once upon a time was mousy brown like yours.
Have you warned Professor Hikita?
Have you warned Professor Hikita?
First thing I did.
The professor and Dr. Emilio Lizardo were actually the first to discover the Eighth Dimension. Almost fifty years ago. Before Buckaroo's parents even knew each other. But there was trouble, a rocket catapult failed and Dr. Lizardo got sucked half in, half out...when they hauled him back ,he wasn't the same guy. His hair was orange...
And his soul black as the Ace of Spades.
And his soul black as the Ace of Spades.
He went on a senseless crime spree, killed a cop during a bank robbery, got caught and judged insane. The professor told us they threw away the key.
Go back to the bus and reroute the call.
And try the President's private number at the hospital. Make sure this is on the level. We're busy people here.
That's me. I've been ionized, but I'm okay. I'm, switching on the homing beacon, mark two minute intervals.
Buckaroo, somebody shanghaied the Professor!
Buckaroo, somebody shanghaied the Professor!
The deuce you say. That crate!
What crate?
I think I'm on to something. You and the guys go back to the house and dig up everything you can on an outfit called Yoyodyne.
I think I'm on to something. You and the guys go back to the house and dig up everything you can on an outfit called Yoyodyne.
Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems? You think they're mixed up in this?
You okay?
Yeah. Just grazed me. The Professor's under the floor too...with the Overthruster...
You're a welcome sight...
Just 'grazed' you, huh?
Apache?
Arachtoid.
Arachtoid.
So I was right. That's nice to know...
We will, old fried, we will.
Sure do pack a mean wallop...let's go...
Anybody we know?
Who put this dirty picture in Buckaroo's viewer?
Buckaroo, you got a minute--?
Not really. This is pretty important.
Not really. This is pretty important.
She wants a picture.
Everybody ready? How do we look? Do we look okay?
I look great. Let's rock 'n' roll.
Hey, any lock can be picked. So what's he up to?
I'm sure we'll find out soon enough.
Running a little late, Buckaroo.
Let her out. In my custody.
Let her out. In my custody.
Let her out? She's a killer.
Planet 10? The same Planet 10 you postulated beyond Pluto, Perfect Tommy? The invisible body?
Yeah, but most of 'em blasted in through the Eighth Dimension in 1938 at Grover's Mills, New Jersey...
It wouldn't tell us the whole story until you got here. It wasn't to talk to the head honcho.
It? Who does?
Buckaroo--! Sorry--
What is it, Tommy?
What is it, Tommy?
Sam's dead! Someone broke into the Jet Car! And things are going haywire over at the lab...
Dead. Damnit!
Where's the professor?
It's Whorfin, Buckaroo. Line 3.
Whorfin? Does he know we're coming?
All accounted for? Where's Penny?
New Jersey brought her back to the bus through heavy fire. Quite a guy if you want my opinion.
These antidote filters the Professor's whipped up will let you to see them like I have since yesterday, as arachtoidal creatures. They won't be pretty, nothing personal, John Parker. But just remember...if we fail tonight, there's no tomorrow.
They will never surrender. They will fight to the end.
What is this thing? A fighter?
Don't look at me, Buckaroo Banzai. I failed flight school.
We're going down! Onto the runway!
The door's locked.
I lack the authority, Buckaroo Banzai.
At least tell them I'm trying! Tell 'em something--!
Does this thing have guns, John Parker?
Boy, I hope so, Buckaroo Banzai.
Pull up! We did it! Holy shit, we did it! Pull up!
Now, Buckaroo Banzai?
Now, Buckaroo Banzai?
Now!
And there's a two-hundred-dollar deductible we have to eat on that crack in her windshield.
Figures. Anybody seen my scope?
They're arachtoids, Buckaroo, from Planet 10!
What? How do you know that?
...where there was some kinda giant crash landing, a huge explosion and they fooled Orson Welles into covering it up! And then they founded Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems and hid there for...
Orson Wells? What about Doctor Lizardo?
...but he wasn't the real Doctor Lizardo...just this arachtoid creep that stole the good doc's body the year before in the Eighth Dimension when Prof. Hikita's lab exploded...
Stole his body? When Doctor Lizardo's hair turned red and his mind snapped? Of course! What else?
Where're you goin'?
To get my guns.
And they got Penny! Look!
Don't shoot!
They're armed for bear, Buckaroo. Check out those radiation levels.
John Parker, tell them we're doing our best. Stall.
Got a casualty list?
Just their side. What're we gonna do with these people? They're illegal aliens, the way I figure, been here forty years, you could throw the book at 'em...
Just their side. What're we gonna do with these people? They're illegal aliens, the way I figure, been here forty years, you could throw the book at 'em...
And ask the American taxpayer to foot the bill? No way. Send 'em back to the Eighth Dimension as soon as we find the Overthruster. It wasn't in Penny's purse...so if we have to run this joint upside down and inside out...
Raise your hand...where?
This is so embarrassing...
This is so embarrassing...
Somebody get her a mike? Can we manage that? And a spotlight. What's your name?
Somebody get her a mike? Can we manage that? And a spotlight. What's your name?
Penny. I'd rather not reveal my last name or my age.
Did you say..."Peggy"?
My name is Penny. Penny Priddy. There I've said it, but it won't mean anything to you. I'm a nobody.
Nobody's a nobody. Why're you crying? What's wrong?
Did I say anything was wrong? I just sponged up a little too much Vat 69, okay? I'm down to my last nickel in this lousy town, I can't get my luggage outta hock 'cause I met this jerk who said he was a record producer when all he had was a record. He offered to set me up for life, and like a

He offered you money?
He offered you money?
Do I look like that kinda girl? I lost my room this morning. I don't know where I'm gonna sleep tonight, but I keep going. What the hell else can I do? I've still got my figure, and like this bozo said, as long as there's a sidewalk, I'll always have a job.
This song's for Peggy. And all you others out there a little down on your luck.
My name's, Penny! But who cares?
Let me go, let me go, you creeps...
Everybody okay up here?
What're you doing here? Why're you looking at me like that?
I guess 'cause you remind me of someone I once knew, long ago before any of this craziness.

Go away. Let me rot?

Who were you really trying to kill last night?

You. Like the papers all say.

Pretty terrible shot.
Was she pretty?
Who?

The girl I remind you of.

She was the Queen of the Netherlands.

It's kinda hard this way.
I'd turn around, but I'm afraid you'd strangle me.
The Netherlands. Whew, that's a long way from Wyoming.
The Netherlands. Whew, that's a long way from Wyoming.
Wyoming? Not Cody, by any chance?

No. Laramie. Except I was born in Cody. How did you know that? Oh, right, sure, I forgot: you know everything.
No. Laramie. Except I was born in Cody. How did you know that? Oh, right, sure, I forgot: you know everything.
No, I don't.
Having a little trouble with that knot, aren't you?
Which? The one in my throat.
Did you have family there--? A sister? In Cody?
I don't know. I always felt like I did, like there was another me...
I don't know. I always felt like I did, like there was another me...
Another 'you'?
Another 'you'?
Somewhere. See I was taken away by the Priddies when I was a baby. I was adopted.

Adopted. I should have know. Of course. If it was a snake, it'd bit me!

What? I don't understand you. I don't understand anything anymore.
What? I don't understand you. I don't understand anything anymore.
Who does? It's a crazy mixed-up world. Just do the best you can with what you have...
You keep an eye on it.
Any time.
Open up or I'll shoot it off.
I'll shoot yours off if I had a gun, you double-dealing Casanova! I thought you liked me for myself. But why should you, huh? A jerk like me.
She must've been a bigger fool than me if she ran out on a guy like you...
She was killed, Penny.
She was killed, Penny.
Oh, my.
Oh, my.
Don't go to pieces. I haven't got time tonight.
Looks like you're the one might go to pieces.
Where's my damn ammo? Nothing is ever where it's supposed to be around here!

How did she die? I wanna know.

You don't wanna know.

Yes, I do. Gimme a chance. I'm stronger than you think.
Yes, I do. Gimme a chance. I'm stronger than you think.

Never.
I gotta be honest with myself and not repress these feelings-I've got mixed emotions-I don't know if I can handle this. Oh, boy...

Yeah...and maybe more important, if you believe in yourself.
Yeah...and maybe more important, if you believe in yourself.
Believe in Penny Priddy?
Believe in Penny Priddy?
Absolutely.
You've got your six guns strapped on. You're ridding off on another adventure? Oh, my God, it's all real...it really is real. I should go with you. Please...
It's too dangerous.
It's too dangerous.
That's just what you would say. This is so unreal. I'm dreaming...
Stay here, I'll be back.
Sure. I won't hold my breath.
I'm not worth it, Buckaroo! Forget me!
Penny--?! Are you all right?
World Watch One. Direct incoming transmission.
Hello, Mr. President. How's my favorite patient? Any tenderness?
Hello, Mr. President. How's my favorite patient? Any tenderness?
That which does not kill us makes us stronger, Buckaroo. What's it like out there in the real world?
Not too terrific, sir. I apologize for the interruption but something very unusual has reared its ugly head in outer space, and it looks like the Earth's caught in a crossfire.
You're gonna have to repeat that, I think, Buckaroo.
...hit Smolensk and precipitate a thermonuclear war, Mr. President.
A what?
A what?
A thermonuclear holocaust, sir. These creatures from Planet 10 are ready to exploit Soviet-American tensions and get us to blow each other off the face of the earth, sir, if necessary.
A thermonuclear holocaust, sir. These creatures from Planet 10 are ready to exploit Soviet-American tensions and get us to blow each other off the face of the earth, sir, if necessary.
You're quite serious about this, aren't you, Buckaroo. We know each other pretty well, I think.
What? A black ship? Where? A black thermopod's been shot down ten miles back.
A black thermopod here? On Earth?! Why, John Gomez? Why?
Where was it, John O'Connor? How far back?
I have a radio fix...
Not here! No Overthruster!
John Whorfin will kill us!
John Whorfin will kill us!
You look! It's not here!
But John Whorfin said kill her.
Damn John Whorfin--!
Buckaroo, come in...over. How does this damn thing work? Can anybody figure this lighter out?
No, sir. I think the flint...
No, sir. I think the flint...

What's happening with my call to SAC?
Still no confirmation either from SAC or Strategic Space Command. They report all surveillance satellite communication jammed.

Possible atmospheric condition, sir...solar. It's unusual, but no cause for alarm. Intelligence reports the Soviets are having the same problem.

Should we be on Code Red?
How long you been riding with Buckaroo, Reno?
Nigh on ten years. Been through a lotta scrapes together.

What'd you do before? Can I ask?
What'd you do before? Can I ask?
Government work. Had my own think tank. Got tired of thinking-wanted some action. Seen plenty of it too. So will you if you stick around.

Where's Buckaroo? Is he alive?
Where's Buckaroo? Is he alive?
Course he's alive. He's Buckaroo Banzai.
What's his problem?
Perfect Tommy's just threatened by smart women. Can you play that thing?
Perfect Tommy's just threatened by smart women. Can you play that thing?
Better than him.
Better see what's keepin' the boss, Reno.
Why me?
Pick those up, Reno.
I didn't drop 'em.
It's a spittin' image.
Doesn't look anything like her to me.

Hell they don't. I met my first wife that way.
Hell they don't. I met my first wife that way.
It's Peggy to these eyes. Same nose, same hair. Plus Buckaroo thinks so too or else he wouldn't be ready to go make a fool of himself, right?
Doctor Lizardo. Wasn't he on TV once?
You're thinking of Mr. Wizard. This guy's an eccentric genius.
You're thinking of Mr. Wizard. This guy's an eccentric genius.
Hey, so was Mr. Wizard.
The name's Reno. This here's Perfect Tommy.
Where do you hail from, Doc?
Reno, how's about you take New Jersey's gear, mosey on over to the bus and introduce him to the rest of the hands.
Why me?
Why me?
Cause Buckaroo needs me here.
Any sign of Buckaroo?
No! Ditto the professor-
We're waiting for the Jet Car. Billy's bringing it.
Asshole probably got lost.
So where's Buckaroo?
Whadda you need Buckaroo for?
Unscheduled surgery. He'll be waltzing along momentarily. What're you doing tonight?
Flying to Cambodia.
That's why I wear a fifty dollar hat. Was a two hundred dollar hat, I hadda kill you.
Bet you say that to all the girls, Perfect Tommy.
Bet you say that to all the girls, Perfect Tommy.
Bet I do.
Now twenty seconds downrange...Perfect Tommy, how on earth is Buckaroo able to keep that thing on the ground?
She's just a damn road hugger, Allison. Plus the man can drive.
Is, uh... Is he okay?
He will be... When he can't write, he drinks.
I am sorry, it's so embarassing.
How about you? Will you be alright?
How about you? Will you be alright?
I'll be fine... Are you a writer, Mr Fink?
I'll be fine... Are you a writer, Mr Fink?
Yes I am. I'm working on a wres  please call me Barton.
I'll tell Bill you dropped by. I'm sure he'll want to reschedule your appointment.
Perhaps you and I could get together at some point also. I'm sorry if that sounds abrupt. I just... I don't know anyone here in this town.
Perhaps the three of us, Mr. Fink.
Please, Barton.
Please, Barton.
Barton. You see, Barton, I'm not just Bill's secretary  Bill and I are... I love. We-
I see.
...I know this must look... funny.
...I know this must look... funny.
No, no 
Let him go.
That son of a bitch... Don't get me wrong, he's a fine writer.
...Oh Barton, I feel so... sorry for him!
What?! He's a son of a bitch!
What?! He's a son of a bitch!

Hello.
Hello.
Audrey, listen, I need help. I know it's late and I shouldn't be calling you like this  believe me I wouldn't have if I could see any other alternative, but I  I'm sorry - listen, how are you  I'm sorry. You doing okay?

Barton. I'm sorry, it's Barton Fink.
If you could, I'd 
If I can. He gets jealous; he-
Hello, Barton.
Audrey, thank you for coming. Thank you. I'm sorry to be such a... such a... Thank you.
Now that's all right, Barton. Everything'll be all right.
Yes. Thank you. How's Bill?
Yes. Thank you. How's Bill?
Oh, he's... he drifted off. He'll sleep for a while now. What is it you have to do, exactly?
Well I have to come up with  an outline, I'd guess you call it. The story. The whole goddamn story. Soup to nuts. Three acts. The whole goddamn-
It's alright, Barton. You don't have to write actual scenes?
It's alright, Barton. You don't have to write actual scenes?
No, but the whole goddamn  Audrey? Have you ever had to read any of Bill's wrestling scenarios?
Yes, I'm afraid I have.
What are they like? What are they about?
What are they like? What are they about?
Well, usually, they're... simply morality tales. There's a good wrestler, and a bad wrestler whom he confronts at the end. In between, the good wrestler has a love interest or a child he has to protect. Bill would usually make the good wrestler a backwoods type, or a convict. And sometimes, instead of a waif, he'd have the wrestler protecting an idiot manchild. The
Well... THIS.

And my input was mostly... EDITORIAL, really, when he'd been drinking-

If I close m'eyes I can almost smell the live oak.
That's hamburger grease, Bill.
That's hamburger grease, Bill.
Well, m'olfactory's turnin' womanish on me  lyin' and deceitful...
...This'll sometimes help.
That doesn't help anything, Bill.
So now I'm s'posed to roll over like an ol' bitch dog gettin' ger belly scratched.
Bill 
M'honey pretends to be impatient with me, Barton, but she'll put up with anything.
Not anything, Bill. Don't test me.
Am I? Maybe to a schoolboy's eye. People who know about the human heart, though, mebbe they'd say, Bill over here, he gives his honey love, and she pays him back with pity  the basest coin there is.
Stop it, Bill!
Barton, I'm afraid it's not a good time-
Drown all those rascals...
All right Barton, I'll see if I can slip away-
Who is that?! Gaddamn voices come into the house... sons of bitches...
I'll try to slip out. If he quiets down, passes out... I'm afraid he thinks  well, he said you were a buffoon, Barton. He becomes irrational
Hesh up! Be still now! DROWN 'EM! DROWN 'EM! DROWN 
How d'ya like your room!

...Hello.
Garland, it's me.
I write.
Oh yeah? What kind of write?
Oh yeah? What kind of write?
Well as a matter of fact, I write for the pictures.
No, I  I didn't mean to sound 
What DID you mean?
What DID you mean?
I  I've got respect for  for working guys, like you 
How long you been up there, Fink?
A week, eight, nine days 
Ever talk to him?
...Once or twice. His name is Charlie Meadows.
Yeah, he's funny that way.
I...
...No. I never saw him with anyone else.
So. You talked to Mundt, what about?
So. You talked to Mundt, what about?
Nothing, really. Said he was in the insurance business.
Well that's what he said.
What else?
What else?
He... I'm trying to think... Nothing, really... He... He said he liked Jack Oakie pictures.
Could you come back later? It's just... too hot... My head is killing me.
All right, forget the heads. Where's Mundt, Fink?
I beg your pardon?
W.P. Mayhew? The writer?
W.P. Mayhew? The writer?
Just Bill, please.
Sir, I'm flattered that you even recognize my name. My God, I had no idea you were in Hollywood.
All of us undomesticated writers eventually make their way out here to the Great Salt Lick. Mebbe that's why I allus have such a powerful thrust.
...A little social lubricant, Mistuh Fink?
It's still a little early for me.
It's still a little early for me.
So be it.
...Still, I must say. I haven't felt peace like this since the grand productive days. Don't you find it so, Barton? Ain't writin' peace?
Well... actually, no Bill...
...No, I've always found that writing comes from a great inner pain. Maybe it's a pain that comes from a realization that one must do something for one's fellow man  to help somehow to ease his suffering. Maybe it's a personal pain. At any rate, I don't believe good work is possible without it.
Mmm. Wal, me, I just enjoy maikn' things up. Yessir. Escape... It's when I can't write, can't escape m'self, that I want to tear m'head off and run screamin' down the street with m'balls in a fruitpickers pail. Mm...
Look, maybe it's none of my business, but a man with your talent  don't you think your first obligation would be to your gift? Shouldn't you be doing whatever you have to do to work again?
And what would that be, son?
And what would that be, son?
I don't know exactly. But I do know what you're doing with that drink. You're cutting yourself off from your gift, and from me and Audrey, and from your fellow man, and from everything your art is about.

I'll jus' walk on down to the Pacific, and from there I'll... improvise.
Are you all right?
I'm sorry, I just feel like I know I shouldn't ask, I just need some kind of help, I just, I have a deadline tomorrow-
I said drown 'em all! Who is that?
Goddamn voices... DROWN 'EM!
I need help, Audrey.

Then who should I talk to?
Don't worry about it. It's just a B picture. I bring it in on budget, they'll book it without even screening it. Life is too short.

Well what do I tell him?
I thought you were going to join us. Jesus, Garland, you left me alone with those people.
Don't panic, I'll join you in a minute. What's you think of Richard and Poppy?
We have to talk a little business. I've just been on the phone to Los Angeles. Barton, Capitol Pictures wants to put you under contract. They've offered you a thousand dollars a week. I think I can get them to go as high as two.
To do what?

I'm not sure anymore. I guess I try to make a difference.
Fair enough. No pressure here, Barton, because I respect you, but let me point out a couple of things. One, here you make a difference to five hundred fifty people a night  if the show sells out. Eighty five million people go to the pictures every week.

I don't know, Garland; my place is here right now. I feel I'm on the brink of success-
I'd say you're already enjoying some.
...I guess I'm sprouting off again. But I am certain of this, Garland: I'm capable of more good work. Maybe better work than I did in Choirs. It just doesn't seem to me that Los Angeles is the place to lead the life of mind.
Okay Barton, you're the artist, I'm just the ten percenter. You decide what you want and I'll make it happen. I'm only asking that your decision be informed by a little realism  if I can use that word and Hollywood in the same breath.
...Look, they love you, kid  everybody does. You see Caven's review in the Herald?
No, what did it say?
No, what did it say?
Take my copy. You're the toast of Broadway and you have the opportunity to redeem that for a little cash  strike that, a lot of cash.
Barton? What time is it? Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm fine, Garland  I have to talk to you. I'm calling long distance.

Neighbor, I'd feel better about the damned inconvenience if you'd let me buy you a drink.
That's all right, really, thank you.
That's all right, really, thank you.
All right, hell, you trying to work and me carrying on in there. Look, the liquor's good, wuddya say?
... You got a glass? It's the least I can do.
Okay... a quick one, sure...
Yeah, just a nip. I feel like hell, all the carryings-on next door.

And what's your line, Mr. Meadows?
Hell no! Call me Charlie. Well Barton, you might say I sell peace of mind. Insurance is my game  door-to-door, human contact, still the only way to move merchandise.
...In spite of what you might think from tonight, I'm pretty good at it.
Doesn't surprise me at all.
Doesn't surprise me at all.
Hell yes. Because I believe in it. Fire, theft, and casualty are not things that only happen to other people  that's what I tell 'em. Writing doesn't work out, you might want to look into it. Providing for basic human need  a fella could do worse.

Oh, it's an exciting time then. I'm not the best-read mug on the planet, so I guess it's no surprise I didn't recognize your name. Jesus, I feel like a heel.
That's okay, Charlie. I'm a playwright. My shows've only played New York. Last one got a hell of a write-up in the Herald. I guess that's why they wanted me here.
Hell, why not? Everyone wants quality. What kind of venue, that is to say, thematically, uh...
Hell, why not? Everyone wants quality. What kind of venue, that is to say, thematically, uh...
What do I write about?
Caught me trying to be fancy! Yeah, that's it, Bart.
Well, that's a good question. Strange as it may seem, Charlie, I guess I write about people like you. The average working stiff. The common man.
Well, that's a good question. Strange as it may seem, Charlie, I guess I write about people like you. The average working stiff. The common man.
Well ain't that a kick in the head!
Well ain't that a kick in the head!
Yeah, I guess it is. But in a way, that's exactly the point. There's a few people in New York  hopefully our numbers are growing  who feel we have an opportunity now to forge something real out of everyday experience, create a theater for the masses that's based on a few simple truths  not on some shopworn abstractions about drama that
...I don't guess this means much to you.
Hell, I could tell you some stories
Hell, I could tell you some stories
And that's the point, that we all have stories. The hopes and dreams of the common man are as noble as those of any king. It's the stuff of life  why shouldn't it be the stuff of theater? Goddamnit, why should that be a hard pill to swallow? Don't call it new theater, Charlie; call it real theater. Call it our theater.

Yeah, I guess that's tragedy right there.
Yeah, I guess that's tragedy right there.
Frequently played, seldom remarked.
You're all right, Charlie. I'm glad you stopped by. I'm sorry if  well I know I sometimes run on.
Hell no! Jesus, I'm the kind of guy, I'll let you know if I'm bored. I find it all pretty damned interesting. I'm the kind schmoe who's generally interested in the other guy's point of view.
Hell no! Jesus, I'm the kind of guy, I'll let you know if I'm bored. I find it all pretty damned interesting. I'm the kind schmoe who's generally interested in the other guy's point of view.
Well, we've got something in common then.
Sure, sure Charlie, you can help by just being yourself.
Well, I can tell you some stories 
...And look, I'm sorry as hell about the interruption. Too much revelry late at night, you forget there are other people in the world.
See you, Charlie.
Howdy, neighbor.
Charlie. How are you.
Charlie. How are you.
Jesus, I hope I'm not interrupting you again. I heard you walking around in here. Figured I'd drop by.
Jesus, I hope I'm not interrupting you again. I heard you walking around in here. Figured I'd drop by.
Yeah, come in Charlie. Hadn't really gotten started yet  what happened to your ear?
Oh, yeah. An ear infection, chronic thing. Goes away for a while, but it always comes back. Gotta put cotton in it to staunch the flow of pus. Don't worry, it's not contagious.
Seen a doctor?
Ah, doctors. What's he gonna tell me? Can't trade my head in for a new one.
No, I guess you're stuck with the one you've got. Have a seat.
Thanks, I'd invite you over to my place, but it's a goddamn mess. You married, Bart?
Nope.
Nope.
I myself have yet to be lassoed.
...Got a sweetheart?
No... I guess it's something about my work. I get so worked up over it, I don't know; I don't really have a lot of attention left over, so it would be a little unfair...
No... I guess it's something about my work. I get so worked up over it, I don't know; I don't really have a lot of attention left over, so it would be a little unfair...
Yeah, the ladies do ask for attention. In my experience, they pretend to give it, but it's generally a smoke- screen for demanding it back  with interest. How about family, Bart? How're you fixed in that department?
My folks live in Brooklyn, with my uncle.
Mine have passed on. It's just the three of us now...
...What's the expression  me myself and I.
Sure, that's tough, but in a sense, we're all alone in this world aren't we Charlie? I'm often surrounded by family and friends, but...
...It was taken by one of my policy holders. They're more than just customers to me, Barton. They really appreciate what I have to offer them. Ya see, her hubby was out of town at the time 
You know, in a way, I envy you Charlie. Your daily routine  you know what's expected. You know the drill. My job is to plumb the depths, so to speak, dredge something up from inside, something honest. There's no road map for that territory...
...This must be boring you.
Not at all. It's damned interesting.
Not at all. It's damned interesting.
Yeah...
...Probably sounds a little grand coming from someone who's writing a wrestling picture for Wallace Beery.
Beery! You got no beef there! He's good. Hell of an actor  though, for my money, you can't beat Jack Oakie. A stitch, Oakie. Funny stuff, funny stuff. But don't get me wrong  Beery, a wrestling picture, that could be a pip. Wrestled some myself back in school. I guess you know the basic moves.

Nope, never watched any. I'm not that interested in the act itself 
Okay, but hell, you should know what it is. I can show you in about thirty seconds.
...You're a little out of your weight class, but just for purposes of demonstration 
That's all right, really 
That's all right, really 
Not a bit of it, compadre! Easiest thing in the world! You just get down on your knees to my left, slap your right hand here...
...All right now, when I say "Ready... wrestle!" you try and pin me, and I try and pin you. That's the whole game. Got it?
...Yeah, okay.
...Yeah, okay.
Ready... wrestle!
It's okay, it's okay.
Well, that's all that wrestling is. Except usually there's more grunting and squirming before the pin. Well, it's your first time. And you're out of your weight class.
I hope these are your shoes.
Hi, Charlie.
Hi, Charlie.
Because that would mean they gave you mine.
Because that would mean they gave you mine.
Yeah, as a matter of fact they did. Come on in.
Jesus, what a day I've had. Ever had one of those days?
Seems like nothing but, lately.
Jesus, what a day. Felt like I couldn't've sold ice water in the Sahara. Jesus. Okay, so you don't want insurance, so okay, that's your loss. But God, people can be rude. Feel like I have to talk to a normal person like just to restore a little of my...
Well, my pleasure. I could use a little lift myself.
Well, my pleasure. I could use a little lift myself.
A little lift, yeah...
...Did I say rude? People can be goddamn cruel. Especially some of their housewives. Okay, so I've got a weight problem. That's my cross to bear. I dunno...
Well it's... it's a defense mechanism.
Well it's... it's a defense mechanism.
Defense against what? Insurance? Something they need? Something they should be thanking me for offering? A little peace of mind?...
...Listen to me belly-achin'. As if my problems amounted to a hill of beans. How goes the life of the mind?
Well, it's been better. I can't seem to get going on this thing. That one idea, the one that lets you get started  I still haven't gotten it. Maybe I only had one idea in me  my play. Maybe once that was done, I was done being a writer. Christ, I feel like a fraud, sitting here staring at this paper.

Those two love-birds next door drivin' you nuts?
How did you know about that?
Know about it? I can practically see how they're doin' it. Brother, I wish I had a piece of that.
Know about it? I can practically see how they're doin' it. Brother, I wish I had a piece of that.
Yeah, but 
Yeah, but 
Seems like I hear everything that goes on in this dump. Pipes or somethin'. I'm just glad I don't have to ply MY trade in the wee-wee hours.
...Ah, you'll lick this picture business, believe me. You've got a head on your shoulders. What is it they say? Where there's a head, there's a hope?
Where there's life there's hope.
And there's hope for you too, Charlie. Tomorrow I bet you sell a half-dozen policies.
Thanks, brother. But the fact is, I gotta pull up stakes temporarily.
Thanks, brother. But the fact is, I gotta pull up stakes temporarily.
You're leaving?
You're leaving?
In a few days. Out to your stompin' grounds as a matter of fact  New York City. Things have gotten all balled up at the Head Office.

I'm truly sorry to hear that, Charlie. I'll miss you.
I'm truly sorry to hear that, Charlie. I'll miss you.
Well hell, buddy, don't pull a long face! This is still home for me  I keep my room, and I'll be back sooner or later...
...Your room does that too?
I guess the heat's sweating off the wallpaper.
I guess the heat's sweating off the wallpaper.
What a dump...

Well...
Well...
Well it's pathetic, isn't it? I mean to a guy from New York.

This kind of heat. It's pathetic.

So they say.

Don't pick up and leave without saying goodbye.
Don't pick up and leave without saying goodbye.
Course not, compadre. You'll see me again.

Are you sure 
Are you sure 
No... no...
Barton. Are you all right?
No... Can I come in?
No... Can I come in?
Why don't we go to your room-
Why don't we go to your room-
Charlie, I'm in trouble. You've gotta help me.
Get a grip on yourself, brother. Whatever the problem is, we'll sort it out.
Charlie, I'm in trouble  something horrible's happened  I've gotta call the police...
...Will you stay with me till they get here?
Don't worry about it, Barton. We can sort it-
...Jesus, Barton, what the hell is this? What're we gonna do?
I've gotta call the police  or you could call for me 

I don't know! I woke up, she was... God, you gotta believe me!
I believe you, brother, but this don't look good.
We gotta call the police 

Hold on. I said hold on, so hold on.
Hold on. I said hold on, so hold on.
Yeah.

But I didn't do it  don't you believe me?
But I didn't do it  don't you believe me?
I believe you  I KNOW you. But why should the police?
Jesus... They can tell that...
They GOTTA believe me, Charlie! They gotta have mercy!
They GOTTA believe me, Charlie! They gotta have mercy!
You're in pictures, Barton. Even if you got cleared eventually, this would ruin you.
...Uh-huh... Where's Audrey?
She's dead, Barton! If that was her name.
Jesus... You're leaving.
Have to, old timer. Just for a while.
Jesus, Charlie, I...
Everything's okay, believe me. I know it's rough mentally, but everything's taken care of.
Everything's okay, believe me. I know it's rough mentally, but everything's taken care of.
Charlie! I've got no one else here! You're the only person I know in Los Angeles...
It's okay... It's okay...
Charlie, I feel like I'm going crazy  like I'm losing my mind. I don't know what to do... I didn't do it, believe me. I'm sure of that, Charlie. I just...
...I just don't know what... to do
You gotta get a grip on, brother. You gotta just carry on  just for a few days, till I get back. Try and stay here, keep your door locked. Don't talk to anyone. We just gotta keep our heads and we'll figure it out.

Yeah, but Charlie 
Yeah, but Charlie 
Dammit, don't argue with me. You asked me to believe you  well I do. Now don't argue with me.
Sure, Charlie.
Funny, huh, when everything that's important to a guy, everything he wants to keep from a lifetime  when he can fit it into a little box like that. I guess... I guess it's kind of pathetic.
It's more than I've got.
Well, keep it for me. Maybe it'll bring you good luck. Yeah, it'll help you finish your script. You'll think about me...
You'll be back?
Don't worry about that, compadre. I'll be back.
...Don't look at me like that, neighbor. It's just me  Charlie.
I hear it's Mundt. Madman Mundt.
But Charlie  why me? Why 
Because you DON'T LISTEN!
...Where did we put him?
I'm at the Earle.
I'm at the Earle.
Never heard of it. Let's move him to the Grand, or the Wilshire, or hell, he can stay at my place.

Thanks, but I wanted a place that was less...
Thanks, but I wanted a place that was less...
Less Hollywood? Sure, say it, it's not a dirty word. Sat whatever the hell you want. The writer is king here at Capitol Pictures. You don't believe me, take a look at your paycheck at the end of every week  that's what we think of the writer. ...so what kind of pictures does he like?
To be honest, I don't go to the pictures much, Mr. Lipnik 
That's okay, that's okay, that's okay  that's just fine. You probably just walked in here thinking that was going to be a handicap, thinking we wanted people who knew something about the medium, maybe even thinking there was all kind of technical mumbo- jumbo to learn. You were dead wrong. We're only interested in one thing: Can you tell a story, Bart? Can

...Yes, thank you.
...Yes, thank you.
Lou.
...Well Bart, which is it? Orphan? Dame?
...Both maybe?
Yeah... rye whiskey?
Boy! You writers! Work hard, play hard! That's what I hear, anyway...

Great! He's poor, this wrestler! He's had to struggle!
Great! He's poor, this wrestler! He's had to struggle!
And then... well...
...Can I be honest, Mr. Lipnik?
CAN you? You damn well better be. Jesus, if I hadn't been honest in my business dealings  well, of course, you can't always be honest, not with the sharks swimming around this town  but if you're a writer, you don't think about those things  if I'd been totally honest, I wouldn't be within a mile of this pool  unless I
I  Mr. Lipnik 
KISS THIS MAN'S FEET!!
Mr. Lipnik, I 
I apologize, Barton.
I apologize, Barton.
No no, Mr. Breeze has actually been a great help 

Mr. Lipnik, I really would feel much better if you could reconsider 
Ah, forget it, kid. I want you to pull this out of your head. If that sonofabitch wouldn't apologize to you, goddammit, I will. I respect your artistry and your methods, and if you can't fill us in yet, well hell, we should be kissing your feet for your fine efforts.
Fink.
Mr. Lipnik.
Mr. Lipnik.
Colonel Lipnik, if you don't mind.
...I was commissioned yesterday in the Army Reserve. Henry Morgenthau arranged it. He's a dear friend.
Congratulations.
Congratulations.
Actually it hasn't officially gone through yet. Had wardrobe whip this up. You gotta pull teeth to get anything done in this town. I can understand a little red tape in peacetime, but now it's all-out warfare against the Japs. Little yellow bastards. They'd love to see me sit this one out.

Yes sir, they 
Yes sir, they 
Anyway, I had Lou read your script for me.
...I gotta tell you, Fink. It won't wash.
With all due respect, sir, I think it's the best work I've done.
With all due respect, sir, I think it's the best work I've done.
Don't gas me, Fink. If you're opinion mattered, then I guess I'd resign and let YOU run the the studio. It doesn't and you won't, and the lunatics are not going to run THIS particular asylum. So let's put a stop to THAT rumor right now.
Yes sir.
I had to call Beery this morning, let him know we were pushing the picture back. After all I'd told him about quality, about that Barton Fink feeling. How disappointed we were. Wally was heartbroken. The man was devastated. He was  well, I didn't actually call him, Lou did. But that's a fair description, isn't it Lou?
I'm sorry if I let you down.
You didn't let ME down. Or even Lou. We don't live or die by what you scribble, Fink. You let Ben Geisler down. He liked you. Trusted you. And that's why he's gone. Fired. That guy had a heart as big as the outdoors, and you fucked him. He tried to convince me to fire you too, but that would be too easy. No,

I tried to show you something beautiful. Something about all of US 
Welcome to the Hotel Earle. May I help you, sir?
I'm checking in. Barton Fink.
F-I-N-K. Fink, Barton. That must be you, huh?
Must be.

Okay then, everything seems to be in order. Everything seems to be in order.

That's right, Fink, he lives next door to you.
What did... What did he 
Funny. As in, he likes to ventilate people with a shotgun and then cut their heads off.
Charlie... Charlie's back...
No kidding, bright boy  we smelt Mundt all over this. Was he the idea man?
Sex?! He's a MAN! We WRESTLED!
You're a sick fuck, Fink.

Female caucasian, thirty years old. Nice tits. No head. You ever see Mundt with anyone meets that description?
But, you know, with the head still on.
Yeah, and he's Buck Rogers.
No reputable company would hire a guy like that.
Ya know, Fink, ordinarily we say anything you might remember could be helpful. But I'll be frank with you: That is not helpful.
Ya see how he's not writing it down?
Ya see how he's not writing it down?
Fink. That's a Jewish name, isn't it?
...I thought you said you were a writer.
I dunno, Duke. I kinda liked it.
Second one of your friends to end up dead.
You didn't tell us you knew the dame.
Sixth floor too high for you, Fink?
Give you nose bleeds?
Tell us where the heads are, maybe they'll go easy on you.
Only fry you once.
He teach you to do it?
You two have some sick sex thing?
Why's it so goddamn hot out here?
...Fred...
Mr. Fink hasn't given a preference, Mr. Lipnik.
How's about it, Bart?
...Thanks Lou. Join us. Join us. Talking about the Wallace Beery picture.
Excellent picture.
Excellent picture.
We got a treatment on it yet?
We got a treatment on it yet?
No, not yet Jack. We just bought the story. Saturday Evening Post.
No, not yet Jack. We just bought the story. Saturday Evening Post.
Okay, the hell with the story. Wallace Beery is a wrestler. I wanna know his hopes, his dreams. Naturally, he'll have to get mixed up with a bad element. And a romantic interest. You know the drill. Romantic interest, or else a young kid. An orphan. What do you think, Lou? Wally a little too old for a romantic interest? Look at me, a
...Maybe we should do a treatment.
Ah, hell, let Bart take a crack at it. He'll get into the swing of things or I don't know writers. Let's make it a dame, Bart, keep it simple. We don't gotta tackle the world our first time out. The important thing is we all have that Barton Fink feeling, but since you're Barton Fink I'm assuming you have it in spades. Seriously
Mr. Lipnik, I 
This man creates for a living! He puts food on your table and on mine! THANK him for it! Thank him, you ungrateful sonofabitch! Thank him or YOU'RE fired!
Get down on your knees, you sonofabitch! Get down on your knees and kiss this man's feet!
Mr. Lipnik, please 
Yes, Colonel.
Hell, I could take you through it step by step, explain why your story stinks, but I won't insult your intelligence. Well all right, first of all: This is a wrestling picture; the audience wants to see action, drama, wrestling, and plenty of it. They don't wanna see a guy wrestling with his soul  well, all right, a little bit, for the critics

"Blood, Sweat, and Canvas".
"Blood, Sweat, and Canvas".
Look at "Blood, Sweat, and Canvas". These are big movies, Fink. About big men, in tights  both physically and mentally. But especially physically. We don't put Wallace Beery in some fruity movie about suffering  I thought we were together on that.
Okay. I went after him. I lost my temper.
Do you have any evidence that he showed your psychiatric file to anyone?
Do you have any evidence that he showed your psychiatric file to anyone?
No.
Where were you tonight?
Home. Watching TV.

All night?

Were you drinking?
Yeah, I was drinking.
When did you start drinking again?
When did you start drinking again?
A couple days ago.
There's no smoking in this building.
What are you gonna do -- charge me with smoking?
Come on -- I'm going to storm into his office in front of everybody in the afternoon and then that night I'm going to kill him? I'd have to be really dumb to do that.
Going after him before gets you off the hook for killing him that's your alibi.
I want you in Dr. Gardner's office at nine o'clock. You're out of control, Curran.
Who are you guys gonna sell my file to this time?
We got a call from Berkeley P.D. There was a killing. A professor. Icepick. In his bed. Multiple stab wounds. 1977.
She was there, wasn't she?
Take care, you hear?
Did you find out about her parents?
Did you find out about her parents?
You're on leave, man. You're on psycho leave. I'm talking to a possible whacko here.
You're on leave, man. You're on psycho leave. I'm talking to a possible whacko here.
You know I'm whacko, Sam, what'd you find?
The boat blew. There was a leak in the gas line. There were two previous repairs. There was a five-mil policy on both of 'em. A real heavy investigation. Zilch. Goose-egg. It was an accident.
Thanks.
I can get my butt kicked for this. You're not supposed to be in here.
It's not gonna take long, Sam.
Hey, that's Dr. Gardner, isn't it?
Bring 1976 up.
How are you, Nick?
I'm fine. Come on, Beth! You know I'm fine! How the hell long do I have to keep doing this?
I'm fine. Come on, Beth! You know I'm fine! How the hell long do I have to keep doing this?
As long as Internal Affairs wants you to, I suppose. Sit down, Nick.
As long as Internal Affairs wants you to, I suppose. Sit down, Nick.
It's bullshit. You know it is.
It's bullshit. You know it is.
I know it is -- but sit down anyway so we can get it over with, okay?
So -- how are things?
Things are fine. I told you. They're fine.
How is your -- personal life?
My sex life is fine. My sex life is pretty shitty actually since I stopped seeing you -- maybe I should think about my Electrolux again.
How about the booze?
It's been three months.
It's been three months.
How about the coke?
How about the coke?
No.
No.
No?
No?
No! I'm working my tail off. I'm off the sauce, I'm not even smoking anymore.
How's not smoking?
It's fucked -- now will you please tell I.A. that I'm just you average healthy totally fucked-up cop and let me get out of here?
It's fucked -- now will you please tell I.A. that I'm just you average healthy totally fucked-up cop and let me get out of here?
Yes.
Yes.

You don't look so okay.
What are you doing here?
Baby-sitting. Rookie cop.

What else is new?
What was she like?
Who?
Who?
Catherine Tramell.
Catherine Tramell.
She said what you said she'd say.
We were in some of the same classes.
Why didn't you tell me?
I need a cigarette.
I thought you quit.
What are you talking about, Nick -- what's wrong with you?
Who's got access to my goddamn file?
It's a confidential psychiatric record, it'd be illegal --She backs into a wall. She looks very scared. He comes very close to her -- puts an arm behind her to the wall.
Don't, Beth. Don't lie to me.
It's Internal Affairs, isn't it?
No, Nick, please --
No, Nick, please --
Who?
Who?
Nilsen.
I don't owe you anything; you don't owe me anything. We went to bed -- what was it? -- ten or fifteen times? It wasn't memorable enough to carry any obligations.
Sometimes I really hate you.
Sometimes I really hate you.
Yeah? Well why don't you find some friendly therapist and work some of that hostility out. But take my advice. Put a little more life into it than you usually do.
You did it for me.
Yes. I care about you. I did it for you.
It's the least I could do... considering I got you into this mess with those reports.
No. I mean it, thank you.
How do you know Catherine Tramell saw my reports?
She knows stuff about me that only you know.
She knows stuff about me that only you know.
She must really be something. From a clinical point of view.
She must really be something. From a clinical point of view.
What was she like in school?
What was she like in school?
I hardly knew her. She gave me the creeps, though. I don't know why.
Beth. I didn't mean what I said. About --
Yes you did. I'm a big girl. I can handle it.
What is your problem? I'm trying to help you. Why won't you let me help you?
I don't need any help.
I don't need any help.
Yes you do. Something's on with you. You're sleeping with her, aren't you?
What is this interest you've got in her?
My interest is in you, not in her. She seduces people, she manipulates --
My interest is in you, not in her. She seduces people, she manipulates --
I thought you hardly know her.
I thought you hardly know her.
I know the type. I'm a psychologist.
What do you want, Nick?
Tell me about Catherine.
She told you, didn't she?
What did she tell me, Beth?
What did she tell me, Beth?
I slept with her once in school. I was just a kid. I was experimenting. It was just that one time. She developed a... fixation... on me. She styled her hair like mine. She wore the same kind of clothes I did. It scared me.
I did dye my hair. It didn't have anything to do with her. I was a redhead for a while, too.
Did you know Noah Goldstein?
Did you know Noah Goldstein?
I had him in two classes.
I had him in two classes.
You saw all the reports, Beth!
She's really sick you know. Don't you know what she's doing? She knows I went to Berkeley. She knows I knew Noah. She makes up that story about me. She's handing you somebody who's obsessed with he her.
She didn't hand you to me. She doesn't even know who you are. She told me about Lisa Henderson.
She didn't hand you to me. She doesn't even know who you are. She told me about Lisa Henderson.
She knew you'd find out who Lisa Henderson is. You're a good cop -- what did she do? Tell you casually and make it seem irrelevant? Did she tell you in bed, Nick? That's how I'd do it.
Why did you change your name?
I got married. He was on staff at the clinic. I was down in Salinas. It didn't... last long.
You should do something about this lock.
She's evil. She's brilliant. Be careful, Nick.
What are you doing here?
Put your hands up!
Put your fucking hands up! Don't move.
I got a message on my machine to meet Gus here. Where is he?
Don't! I know about your husband. You still like girls, Beth?
What?
I'm De...
I know who you are.
How long were you dating him?
I wasn't dating him. I was fucking him.
How long were you having sex with him?
About a year and a half.

No. I wasn't in the mood to have sex with anyone last night.
Ms. Tramell, we'd like you to come downtown and answer some questions for us.
Are you arresting me?
Are you arresting me?
If that's the way you want to play it.
Do you always keep old newspapers around?
Only when they make interesting reading.
Do you have a cigarette?
I don't smoke.
I don't smoke.
Yes, you do.
Yes, you do.
I quit.
I thought you were out of cigarettes.
I found some in my purse; would you like one?
I told you -- I quit.
It won't last.
What's your new book about?
A detective. He falls for the wrong woman.
Did I miss something?
I told them you wouldn't want an attorney present.
I told them you wouldn't want to hide.
I have nothing to hide.
But you said you liked men to use their hands.
No. I said I liked Johnny to use his hands. I don't give any rules, Nick. I go with the flow.
Writing a book about it gives you an alibi for not killing him.
Yes it does, doesn't it?
You like playing games, don't you?
I've got a degree in psych. It goes with the turf. Games are fun.
How did you feel when he died?
I loved him. I hurt.
How did you feel when I told you Johnny Boz had died -- that day at the beach.
I felt somebody had read my book and was playing a game.
I felt somebody had read my book and was playing a game.
But you didn't hurt --
But you didn't hurt --
No.
No.
Because you didn't love him --
Because you didn't love him --
That's right.
Even though you were fucking him.
You still get the pleasure. Didn't you ever fuck anybody else while you were married, Nick?
Sure.
Thanks.
I'm tired.
It's got to be tiring to beat that machine.
If I were guilty, and if I wanted to beat that machine, it wouldn't be tiring. It wouldn't be tiring at all.
Why not?
Why not?
Because I'm a professional liar. I spend most of my waking hours dwelling on my lies. For my writing.
I passed.
You see? We're both innocent, Nick.
How do you know all this stuff about me?
You know all about me.
You know all about me.
I don't know anything that isn't police business.
I don't know anything that isn't police business.
You know I don't like to wear any underwear, don't you, Nick?
Am I... disturbing you?
No. Come in.
Would you like a drink? I was just going to have one.
No, thanks.
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
I'd like to ask you some, too.
You tell me.
I don't know. But you do.
It was an accident. They got in the line of fire.
Four shootings in five years. All accidents.
Four shootings in five years. All accidents.
They were drug buys. I was a vice cop.
Tell me about Professor Goldstein.
There's a name from the past.
There's a name from the past.
You want a name from the present? How about Hazel Dobkins?
Noah was my counselor in my freshman year. That's probably where I got the idea for the icepick. For my book. Funny how the subconscious works. Hazel is my friend.
She wiped out her whole family.
She wiped out her whole family.
Yes. She's helped me understand homicidal impulse.
Yes. She's helped me understand homicidal impulse.
Didn't you study it in school?
Didn't you study it in school?
Only in theory. You know all about homicidal impulse, don't you, shooter? Not in theory -- in practice.
What happened, Nick? Did you get sucked into it? Did you like it too much?
No.
I didn't.
Yes, you did. They never tested you, did they? But Internal Affairs knew.
How exactly did you hear?
I have attorneys. They have friends. I have friends. Money buys you a lot of attorneys and friends.
I have attorneys. They have friends. I have friends. Money buys you a lot of attorneys and friends.
I don't know about that I don't have any money I don't have any attorneys Gus is my only real friend.
I don't know about that I don't have any money I don't have any attorneys Gus is my only real friend.
I wasn't talking about real friends. Why doesn't Gus like me.
I wasn't talking about real friends. Why doesn't Gus like me.
I like you.
I like you.
Do you?
Do you?
Yeah. Would you like to come up and have a drink?
You're not easy to figure. I'm just very good at figuring.
Don't get too cocky.
Don't get too cocky.
Why not?
Why not?
You can make a mistake.
You can make a mistake.
Not me.
Jack Daniel's okay? It's gonna have to be.
Fine.
Fine.
Ice?
Ice?
Please.
What did you pay Nilsen?
Isn't he the policeman that you shot, Shooter?
What if I asked you not to call me Shooter?
What if I call you Nicky?
What if I call you Nicky?
My wife used to call me that.
My wife used to call me that.
I know, Nicky, but I like it.
Cheers. My friends call me Catherine.
What did Bobby Vasquez used to call you?
What did Bobby Vasquez used to call you?
Bitch mostly, but he meant it affectionately. You don't have any coke, do you? I love coke and Jack Daniel's.
Bitch mostly, but he meant it affectionately. You don't have any coke, do you? I love coke and Jack Daniel's.
There's Pepsi in the fridge.
There's Pepsi in the fridge.
It's not the same thing, is it?
Say -- "What do you want from me, Catherine?"
What do you want from me, Catherine?
Aren't you going to thank me?
What's it about?
What's it about?
A boy kills his parents. They have a plane. He makes it look like an accident.
Why does he do it?
To see if he can get away with it.
When did you write it?
You mean did I write it before my parents died?
You mean did I write it before my parents died?
Yes.
Yes.
No. I wrote it years afterwards.
You're not going to stop following me around now just because you're on leave -- are you?
No.
No.
Good. I'd miss you. You can get into trouble, though. You're not really a cop anymore.
Good. I'd miss you. You can get into trouble, though. You're not really a cop anymore.
I'll risk it.
I'll risk it.
Why take the risk?
Why take the risk?
To see if I can get away with it.
How's your new book?
I'm getting deeper and deeper into my character.
I'm leaving the house around midnight. In case you're going to follow me. I'm going down to Johnny's club.
I'll meet you there.
Maybe she saw something she didn't see before.
She's seen everything before.
Did you think it was so special?
I told her it was the fuck of the century.
What did you think?
I thought it was a pretty good beginning.
How about Roxy? Is she a fuck to the century, too?
Do you want her to join us sometime?
How's your shoulder?
Fine. How's your back?
Fine. How's your back?
It hurts.
Are you kidding? You think this is my idea of morning-after conversation?
Do you want personal insights and adolescent secrets? I don't do those.
I thought that business with the scarf was pretty nifty.
I told you I had a vivid imagination.
You shouldn't play this game.
I don't have a choice.
You're in over your head.
I know.
I should have known. I came into the house when you were down on the beach. She looked at me so strangely. She left right after you. I shouldn't have let her watch us. She wanted to watch me all the time. She tried to kill you, didn't she?
Did you like her to watch?
Did you like her to watch?
Do you think I told her to kill You?
Do you think I told her to kill You?
No.
No.
Everybody that I care about dies.
It's OK. It's OK.
Make love to me.
Do you think she killed Johnny Boz?
For what... to set me up? She loved me she wouldn't frame me.
For what... to set me up? She loved me she wouldn't frame me.
Maybe she got jealous of Johnny Boz, too.
Maybe she got jealous of Johnny Boz, too.
No, she didn't... she never got jealous before... she got excited. I don't have luck with women. There was this girl I met while I was in college. I slept with her once. She started following me around, taking my picture. She dyed her hair, copied my clothes. Lisa something... Oberman. It was awful.
I thought you didn't do adolescent secrets.
I never have before.
No.
No?
No?
No more games, Nick. I'm tired of playing games!
You won't believe me.
Try me.
I paid him $50,000 in cash for your psychiatric file.
When?
When?
About three months before I met you.
About three months before I met you.
Why?
I'd read about your shootings in the papers. I decided to write a book about a detective. I wanted to know my character.
You paid $50,000 for your character?
You paid $50,000 for your character?
I would've paid more. I wanted to know everything about you. Then you came down here after Johnny got killed... it gave me a chance to get to know my character better.
I would've paid more. I wanted to know everything about you. Then you came down here after Johnny got killed... it gave me a chance to get to know my character better.
What about the other night. What about last night? Was that to get to know your character?
What about the other night. What about last night? Was that to get to know your character?
Maybe I'm losing interest in my book.
Do you believe me?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I'll convince you.
What did he say?
He asked if I had an icepick in me yet.
He asked if I had an icepick in me yet.
Funny.
Can I talk to you a minute?
Honey, why don't you go in the car? I'll be right there.
You like to hang out with murderers or what? Did you know Roxy --
Of course I knew.
I just thought I'd surprise you. What's the matter?
I found Lisa Henderson.
I found Lisa Henderson.
Did you? What's she doing?
You're not going to tell me what she's doing. I thought we weren't playing games anymore.
I did, too. She told me it was backwards -- she said you even styled your hair the way she did.
You still think I kill people, don't you?
No.
No.
Liar.
How'd you get in here?
I decided to give you one more chance. I missed you.
I decided to give you one more chance. I missed you.
You didn't not see me long enough to miss me.
You didn't not see me long enough to miss me.
Did you miss me?

No.

Come over here and tell me no.
I have to do some research tomorrow.

I finished my book.
How did it end?

I told you. She kills him.
What do you want, Nick? Flowers? I'll send you some flowers.
What is this -- some kind of... Joke? Are we playing games again?
What is this -- some kind of... Joke? Are we playing games again?
The games are over. You were right. It was the fuck of the century, Shooter.
What do we do now, Nick?
We fuck like minks. We raise rugrats. We live happily ever after.
I hate rugrats.
We fuck like minks. We forget the rugrats. We live happily ever after.
I'm John Corrigan. I'm an assistant district attorney, Ms. Tramell. Can we get you anything? Would you like some coffee?
No thank you.
There is no smoking in this building, Ms. Tramell.
What are you going to do? Charge me with smoking?
Would you tell us the nature of your relationship with Mr. Boz?
I had sex with him for about a year and a half. I liked having sex with him.
Did you ever engage in sado- masochistic activity with him?
Exactly what do you have in mind, Mr. Corrigan.
Exactly what do you have in mind, Mr. Corrigan.
Did you ever tie him up?
Did you ever tie him up?
No.
Did you kill Mr. Boz, Ms. Tramell?
I'd have to be pretty stupid to write a book about a killing and then kill him the way I described in my book. I'd be announcing myself as the killer. I'm not stupid.
How did he die?
He was murdered.
He was murdered.
Really. Maybe that's why you're from Homicide. How?
I don't really feel like talking anymore.
Listen, lady, we can do this downtown if you --
Listen, lady, we can do this downtown if you --
Read me my rights and arrest me and I'll go downtown.
You have the right to an attorney.
Why would I need an attorney?
You workin' on another book?
Yes I am.
Yes I am.
It must really be somehtin' --makin' stuff up all the time.
It teaches you to lie.
How's that?
How's that?
You make it up, but it has to be believable. They call it suspension of disbelief.
You make it up, but it has to be believable. They call it suspension of disbelief.
I like that. "Suspension of Disbelief."
The answer is no. I didn't kill him.
Do you use drugs, Ms. Tramell?
Do you use drugs, Ms. Tramell?
Sometimes.
What kind of drugs?
Cocaine.
In the beginning. Then I got to like what he did for me.
That's pretty cold, ain't it, lady?
That's pretty cold, ain't it, lady?
I'm a writer, I use people for what I write. You write what you know. Let the world beware.

What are you doing here, Pop?
What are you doing here, Pop?
I came in here to jack off the damn machine. One dead psychology professor. Noah Goldstein. Dr. Noah Goldstein. And guess what? He was her counselor.
Was she ever suspect?
No, sir. They never even got a statement from her.
Do you remember a case -- 1956 -- Hazel Dobkins?
Hell yes! Couldn't get it outta my head for years. Still can't. Nice little kids -- nice husband, wasn't porkin' around -- no financial problems. One day -- outta the clear blue sky -- she does 'em. All of 'em. Used a knife. He got for a wedding present. Didn't even deny it. Sweet as honey. Said she didn't know why she done it.
What's goin' down, son?
Nothin' I'll be okay, pop.
No, sir. You won't. There's smoke off yonder on the horizon. They're gonna want your badge.

I don't son, but I got the minority opinion.
I don't think it's funny.
Well, hell, son, it's got a certain ring to it, I'll say that.
Forgive me for askin', son, and I don't mean to belabor the obvious, but why is it that you've got your head so far up your own ass?

It doesn't make sense. She didn't know me three months ago.
Maybe it wasn't her that paid him. Maybe the money was for somethin' else. How the fuck do I know? I'm just an old city cowboy tryin' not to fall outta his saddle.
You all right, pop? You want me to drive you?

I don't believe it.
I don't believe it.
Why not?
Why not?
You're my friend, Gus.
I don't understand what the hell's going on here, pop.
Ain't that hard, son. This young farmgirl, she got tired of all that attention goin' to her little brothers -- she fixed 'em. Just like 'ole Hazel Dobkins fixed her whole family -- except young Roxy here, she didn't use a wedding present. She used Daddy's razor.
I'm not sure anymore she did it.
Which one you talkin' about now, son? We know ole Hazel did it; we know young Roxy did it -- and the other one Well, hell, she's got that magna come lawdy pussy on her that done fried up your brain.
So Nilsen had a report on her -- so what. You don't know what the hell was in it?
Catherine told me what was in it.
Catherine told me what was in it.
If she's telling you the truth.
If she's telling you the truth.
Don't you get it, Gus? If Beth killed Johnny Boz to frame Catherine -- she wouldn't want anyone to know what happened at Berkeley. It gives her the motive to kill Nilsen.

He was I.A. He probably asked her about it.
She'd have to be nuttier than a twenty-pound Christmas fruitcake. She's not the one who hangs out with multiple murderers -- your girlfriend is.
She's a writer -- it's part of what she does.
She's a writer -- it's part of what she does.
Goddamn writers -- all they do is use up trees and ruin people's eyes. There's gotta be somebody at Berkeley who knows what the hell happened.

I'm going with you.
I'm going with you.
She said alone -- suite 405. It ain't gonna take long.
Maybe the maid did it.
She's 54 years old and weighs 240 pounds.
Not unless she got up in the ring and turned into one mean sonofabitch.
Maybe she did, Gus. Maybe she grew herself an Afro and learned a left hook and put shoe polish on her face. Let's polygraph her again and ask her about it.
Maybe it's for old-time's sake.
Sometimes I think he started banging her just to get himself off the hook with Internal Affairs.

Is he dead?
Were you with him last night?
You're looking for Catherine, not me.
What was the motive?
She said she didn't know herself, just sort of did it on impulse. The razor just happened to be there.
He left the club with his girlfriend about midnight. That's the last time anybody saw him.
What was it?
Keep your three o'clock.
Do you want me to work the case, Phil, or do you want me to --
Do you want me to work the case, Phil, or do you want me to --

Are you kidding me?
Formerly engaged to Roberto Vasquez, deceased --
I love it. She's got a hundred million bucks. She fucks fighters and rock and roll stars. And she's got a degree in screwing with peoples' heads.
You forgot her degree in literature. She's a writer. She published a novel last year under a pen name. Do you want to know what it's about?
So what do we do -- nothing?
We bring her in for questioning.
What is all this "Nick" stuff -- Nick would you like a cigarette. Nick can you give me a ride.
She didn't ask me for the ride. She asked anybody.
She didn't ask me for the ride. She asked anybody.
And you volunteered.

Come on, Phil. You're not gonna let this slide. What about her parents? What about what else she's published? At least we should get the stuff to see if we find anything else that's an amazing real-life coincidence.

How you're saying she killed her parents? Did she kill Bobby Vasquez, too?
Fuck you, Phil.
Fuck you, too Nick.
Gus -- go over to Berkeley. Harrigan -- find out what else she's published. Andrews -- get the files on her parents' accident. Carbon Beth on everything. I want some psychological input on this Andrews and Harrigan go; Nick is left there with Gus.
What about me?
I'll ask you once, Nick -- for the record did you kill him?
No.
I.A.'s going to talk to you more about Nilsen. They're handling the investigation, we're not. Stay in touch with Dr. Gardner, it'll help on the evaluation.
She killed him.
She killed him.
Beth? Now you've got Beth killing people?

Catherine Tramell. It's part of her game.

First you've got her buying your file. Now you've got her killing Nilsen. Forget her, willya? Go someplace. Sit in the sun. Get away from this goddamn fog. Get her out of your system.
You don't but it, do you? She knew nobody would but it. She knew I'd say she did it. And she knew nobody would buy it.
Tell me again. I want to hear you say it again.
It was an accident.

I don't think she meant to go off the hill, do you?
Don't fuck with me, Nick. I don't need a reason to put your ass in a sling.
You knew her, didn't you?
Gus and I talked to her at Tramell's house. All we did was write her name down.
Gus and I talked to her at Tramell's house. All we did was write her name down.
I told you to stay away from Tramell.
I told you to stay away from Tramell.
Yeah. But you didn't tell me to stay away from her car.
She's a suspect.
On what basis?
On what basis?
Catherine Tramell. Age 30. No priors, no convictions. Double major, magnum cum laude, Berkeley, 1980. Literature and Psychology. Daughter, sole survivor -- Marvin and Elaine Tramell, killed in a boating accident, 1978, Catherine Tramell sole heir. Estimated assets $110 million.

She was the last person seen with the guy -- I'll take the responsibility.
She was the last person seen with the guy -- I'll take the responsibility.
It's yours.
We know you're not stupid, Ms. Tramell.
Maybe that's what you're counting on to get you off the hook.
We're sorry to disturb you, we'd like to ask you some --
Are you vice?
Why do you think he's dead?
You wouldn't be here otherwise, would you?
Who are you?
I'm Roxy. I'm her -- friend.
How old was she when this happened?
Fourteen. We seal juvenile records until they're deceased. That's why you didn't find it in your computer.
Anderson. Jack W. Donald M. I'm sorry. No Lisa.
Did you check all four years?

Yes I did.

Can there be some mistake?

Only if you're making it.
He died -- about five or six years ago.
He was shot.
My name is Jean Michel Basquiat. Have you heard of me?
No. Should I have?
No. Should I have?
I'm a painter, too.
I'm a painter, too.
Really. Huh. Too bad.
Hey  it's the big A.M..
Rene's been telling me about your work.
Is this finished yet?
I don't know.
I don't know.
When's your show?
When's your show?
Not sure. How was yours?
Not sure. How was yours?
I haven't decided yet. Rene, you wanna come over to the studio tomorrow. I wanna make a painting of you.
What do you think?
I like the one with the dragon's heads a lot. But the black one's filled up with too many heads... I'd take some of them out. I think you're painting too fast. I wouldn't put in so many heads. Let it breathe a bit.

It's always how you would do it. This is my version.

You're right. It's your version. You should come over to the studio sometime.

Why, so you could humiliate me?

No, I wanted to make a painting of you.
Naa..
Let's get out of here.
Let's get out of here.
See ya in an hour. So what do you think?
This is painted on a backdrop from the Kabuki theater in Japan. I painted it after Joseph Beuys died. A rebirth painting. I felt like he could've painted it, or maybe someone else was painting it instead of me. The Chinese calligraphers used to change their name mid-career so they could start over as someone else..
Do you ever get sick of it?
Do you ever get sick of it?
Of what?
Of what?
The whole thing  painting.

No. It's one of the few times I feel good. I used to have to go to work and cook every day. That I got sick of.

What about the shit they write?
What about the shit they write?
You're asking me this because of the 'lapdog' remark. I read that. The person that wrote that has the compassion of a housefly. That's your enemy, not your audience. Your audience hasn't even been born yet. It's a lie that art is popular. The only thing popular about it is that it's written about in newspapers. I'm surprised when anybody comes to my openings.

As long as I've known Andy, he's never asked me for anything except to speak to you about getting off drugs. He's painted my picture, we've eaten dinner in God knows how many places together. But he doesn't care about me. He cares about you. You're the only person he cares about. He's your friend. Fuck that article. You want a toasted bagel with

You don't even work on your stuff!
Andy, man, thanks for coming. I'd like to paint your jacket.
My jacket? Gee, great... Your show looks great. Quite a turnout. You look great. You kids. You drink red wine with fish. You can do anything! Make paintings in the basement of your gallery? First time I've heard of that!
Jean Michel, this is Mary Boone. She's got the great new gallery.
Yeah, I met her already.
I wish they'd quit writing this shit about me.
That's good. At least they're interested.
That's good. At least they're interested.
Everybody's paying top dollar for scraps of paper, refrigerator doors  anything with a SAMO tag on it. The other day, I just wanted a pack of cigarettes, so I did a drawing and sold it for two bucks. A week later this gallery calls me up: "Somebody's offering us the drawing. Should we buy it for five thousand?"

Yeah  I'd do that... You could teach me.

Gee. I don't need to. You're a natural. You should sign up with my modeling agent.
Cool.
My dog, Archie... I woke up with flea bites... Creepy. I ran out and bought flea collars. They work really well.
Let's leave this town and go someplace. Some island.
Let's go to the Carnegie Museum. They have the world's most famous sculptures all in these giant plaster replicas. It's really great. It's in Pittsburg.
Ouch..
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
That girl looks just like my old girlfriend Gina.

How come you're not peeing on them yourself?
How come you're not peeing on them yourself?
I don't like beer.
That was my favorite part!
We can do better. It needed more white.
I don't even have any friends anymore besides you. And everyone says "Warhol? That death-warmed over person on drugs? He's just using you."
Gee. You shouldn't take it so seriously, Jean. That's why you can't stop taking drugs. You always think people don't like you. Everyone likes you.
Gee. You shouldn't take it so seriously, Jean. That's why you can't stop taking drugs. You always think people don't like you. Everyone likes you.
People are only interested in you because you're famous, not because they know a fuckin' thing about your work.
Bruno called. In Europe, people are saying you're gonna die from drugs. They think they can cash in on your death.
When I was poor, everybody doubted I could make it. When I got rich, everyone said, `yeah, but he'll never keep it up.' Now everyone says `he's killing himself.' So I clean up, and then they say `Look. His art's dead.' I don't take drugs, anyway. I'm healthy now.
After the show we should take a nice long vacation. Maybe go to Hawaii. That's what I'm gonna do. I'm going to give up painting and start playing music again. I wanna sing.
That would be a pity because you're a real painter.
Who is it?
Annina Nosei.
Annina Nosei.
Who?
Is Jean Michel here?
No.
These are great.
Aren't they?
Aren't they?
How much for these five?

You should talk to him about this.
I'm interested in showing Jean's work.
I really think you should talk to him about this.
No.
You haven't been by lately.
I'd love to see some more of your work... Where's your studio?
You name it, I paint there.
You name it, I paint there.
Well, I don't want to get mugged on a Bowery street corner. Maybe I could find a place for you to work. Take my card.

You want a drink?
When?
How about right now?
Tom and Cynthia Kruger.
I know.
Jean, your parents are here.
Hi Dad. Hi Nora.
It's great that people are interested, but if anyone's going to buy anything, I'll handle it for you. Everything goes through the gallery, even if they come to your studio.
Sure.
Chill, man! Be cool! This isn't even my apartment!
Oh man, you a FINE nigga! You know that?
Oh man, you a FINE nigga! You know that?
Cut it out, man! And don't be callin' me that shit!

That's the same guy who did this painting.
I know that. Don't let him get away.
It doesn't matter how much you worked on them. It matters how much you can get for them.
I can get ten.
You shouldn't have put it in the show. This is the one I absolutely have to have. I really love it.
Sure, ok..
Do you think I could borrow your limousine? I'll get it back to you in an hour.
It's OK. Just have him bring you to dinner at Mr. Chow's later. We'll be there.
B.B. It's me  Jean! What's the matter? No snow in Switzerland this year?
I didn't see you.
I didn't see you.
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
You haven't heard? Andy's dead.
I hear your show was sold out already. There's a very important collector who's interested in some of your works.
Bring him over sometime. I have some other stuff to show him.
Jean Michel... Crawling from the wreckage?
I need a dealer.
I need a dealer.
You have a bunch of them, don't you? Albert Milo walks in from another room.
Bruno spoke to me already. We could talk about it.
I'm here.
I'm here.
OK. I'll be at your studio Thursday three o'clock.
What is it that gets you out of bed in the morning?
I hate this. Turn that off.

Or rather, do you think you're being exploited or are you yourself exploiting the white image of the black artist from the ghetto?

I knew I left these somewhere. One of these'll send your kids to college someday. Here  I made this for you.
Thanks. Your dad called again  something about a job.
You got a date already?
We're getting married. She said she could tell I was a great artist  she could see it in my eyes. She said she wanted to be by my side and have inter-racial babies with me.
Come on, Jean. Get rid of your cigarette. Concentrate.
I am... On Gina. Fuck  I didn't think we were actually gonna do this.

Whatever. Famous. To where you can do your stuff all day without thinking about anything else.
Ummm... Four years. Six to get rich.
Famous people are usually pretty stupid. You're too smart. You'd get bored to death. You don't wanna be like John Henry  fighting the machine. Just do what you do. It's about integrity. Follow your heart.
Who's John Henry?

No, I don't. I'm alone. We all are. Especially here. The world's unjust. The respect fools get. The disrespect I get.
What is it you want? Respect? I have respect for you, just for making this call. One philosopher said "Sadness is a sin against the richness of the world." Think about it. Feel it.

You don't even know me. I want real respect.
What? What do you want?
Fame. My liquid hijack Marlboros and the moon and the cow that jumped over it.
You heard of Albert Milo. I made that niggah. I'm Rene Ricard. Didn't you read "Not About Albert Milo?" I know who to hype. Baby, I'm gonna make you a star.
Can you put me in the ring with him?
Can you put me in the ring with him?
I can put you in the ring with him. Even book the dates. But those big boys know how to fight. They could make you look real sissy. I was looking at that painting upstairs. It's the first time a picture made me embarrassed to own anything. So what's your real name? 'Samo?'

Jean Michel Basquiat.
Uh huhh... Band practice? It's Benny. He wants to know why you're not at band practice...?
Fuck... I forgot about that.
Fuck band practice... If you're gonna be a painter you're gonna have to break a few hearts  you don't wanna be like Tony Bennett..
Tony Bennett... What do you mean?
Tony Bennett... What do you mean?
Singing on stage and painting in your spare time.

I didn't know Tony Bennett painted.

My point exactly.
So keep painting.
Yes, Boss. If you're so smart, why are you here with me in this basement?
Yes, Boss. If you're so smart, why are you here with me in this basement?
You're news. I want the scoop. I write it down. When I speak, no one believes me. But when I write it down, people know it's true. There's never been a black painter in art history that's been considered really important, you know?

5:11.
That one's for you.
Thanks... I'll take it tonight.
Thanks... I'll take it tonight.
I can't. After the show.
You fucking little whore! You sold my painting! I'm gonna tell you something, brother  when you're climbing up the ladder of success, don't kick out the rungs! Believe that shit.
I'll make you another one.
I'll make you another one.
Forget it.
Hey, Rene.
Thanks again for not inviting me. I'm only here on business.
Jean, could you get me a Phillips screwdriver?
A what?
A what?
A Phillips head. From the toolbox.
A Phillips head. From the toolbox.
Yeah.
'Phillips head,' right?
Yeah.
You don't have any!!!
That's impossible. I've got, like, five of 'em!
Jean? Hold this, please. You'll get there. But it's good to have something to fall back on. That's why I became an electrician. It pays the rent. Y'know, I'm an artist, too.
I didn't know.
I didn't know.
I sculpt. I'm really just starting to find myself. How old are you? Twenty? You're just like I used to be. I'm forty-one. And I'm glad I haven't gotten any recognition. It gave me time to develop.
OK! Goodbye!
Pipe down, Lech. Let him order.

YO! Jean, this is Ramellzee.
Yo... You know why Rammellzee's here, don't you?

Uh-oh!
Uh-oh!
I'm here for an interrogation. You've been called a graffiti artist and I wanna know why. All I see are scribble scrabble abstractions!
Man, I was up on him years ago on the IRT.
You're selling and ending the culture. Not one bit of information. Only to get the money and growl with the power, man.

That's ignorant.
Mr. Wayne ... Something wrong?
No, nothing, ah ... His parents ... I ... I hope he finds them.
It's cold.
It's vichyssoise, sir.
It's vichyssoise, sir.
Vichyssoise. Supposed to be cold, right?
I suppose you feel better now, sir.
No, actually I feel worse.
Sorry, Alfred, I have to get to the Plaza. You heard Penguin, he was practically begging me to show.
Which is why I hoped you'd snub him.

Selina ... more facets than Vicki, huh? Funny, but sort of mysterious...
"Affair" ... yes, maybe ... if she ...
"Affair" ... yes, maybe ... if she ...
I think I'll take the stairs.
Mr. Wayne ... a reminder: Tonight is that loathsome party, hosted by that odious Mr. Shreck. May we RSVP in the resoundingly negative?
I'm tempted, but ... well ... it is an occasion for celebration, and ... umm ... Selina will probably be there ...

Ah. "Who", may I ask, are you going "as"?

You'll never guess.
I guess this mean we won.
Yes, I suppose that we did.
Well ... Come what may... Merry Christmas, Mr. Wayne.
Right. Sure. And "Peace on earth, good will toward men."
Where's the fire?
"Shreck's." You --
How could you? I'm a woman...
I'm -- sorry, I --
As I was saying: I'm a woman, and can't be taken for granted. Are you listening, you Batman you?
Hanging on every word.
Hanging on every word.
Good joke. Wanna hear another one?
A "he-man"? Sure. They shine that beacon in the sky, then wonder what hole I crawl out of.
Wow, a real response and you're not even trying to get into my tights. But explain me ... If you're so down on "them" out there, why bust your bat-buns to protect 'em?

I just can't sleep at night. Exploding department stores keep me up. One ...
I can't sleep either, lately. A little link, between us. But bottom line baby, you live to preserve the peace, and I'm dying to disturb it. That could put a strain on our relationship.
...four, five.
Hey stud: I thought we had something together.
We do.
A kiss under the misteltoe. Mistletoe can be deadly, if you eat it ...
But a kiss can be even deadlier, if you mean it.
You're the second man who killed me this week. But hey, no prob ... I've got seven lives left.
I tried to grab you -- save you --

I think you're jealous that I'm a genuine freak, and you have to wear a mask!
Maybe you're right.
We've met.
Have we?
Sorry. I mistook me for somebody else.

You don't seem like the type who does business with Mr. Shreck.
No. And you don't seem like the type who takes orders from him.

The news these days ... weird. People looking to superheroes for their peace of mind, and blaming their problems on super-villains ... instead of themselves, or their spouses at least.
And it's not even accurate ... I mean, "Batman Blows It"? The guy probably prevented <u>millions</u> in property damage.

I heard on TV, "Catwoman is thought to weigh 140 pounds." How do these hacks <u>sleep</u> at night?
You're not coming to that, are you? "The Relighting of the Tree" thing?
I wouldn't be caught dead. No, it's probably how I would be caught. The Mayor stupidly took Cobblepot's bait --

Sure.
Well? Was "Vicki" right? About your difficulty with duality?
If I said yes, then you might think me a Norman Bates, or a Ted Bundy type ... and then you might not let me kiss you.
It's the so-called "normal" guys who always let you down. Sickos never scare me. At least they're commited.
Ah ... then you've come to the right lonely mansion.
I, ah ... never fool around on the first date.
Nor I, on the second.

Now don't give me a killing-Max- won't-solve-anything speech, because it will. Aren't you tired of this sanctimonious robber baron always coming out on top? When he should be six feet under?

I'd offer you coffee, but my assistant is using her vacation time.
Good time, too. Everyone but the bandits seem to be slacking off till after New Years'.
If my life has had any meaning, that's the meaning.

Not compared to that "Cobblepot" person you're promoting...

Wayne, I'll not stand for mud- slinging in this office. If my assistant were here, she'd already have escorted you out, to --
What happened?
Yes, did -- did you injure yourself on that ski slope? Is that why you cut short your vacation and came back?
Ingenious costume. Let me guess ... Trust-fund goody-goody?
Course you're feeling fine ... You almost made a monster the Mayor of Gotham City.

Selina! Selina Kyle!? You're fired! And Bruce -- Bruce Wayne! Why are you dressed up as Batman?
He <u>is</u> Batman, you moron.
He <u>is</u> Batman, you moron.
Was.
You killed me, Batman killed me, Penguin killed me. Three lives down. Got enough bullets to finish me off?

Down, Oswald. We have to talk. You see we've got something in common.

Oh, him again. He's already history -- check it out.
We're gonna disassemble his spiffy old Batmobile, then reassemble it as an H-bomb on wheels. Capiche? Yesterday's victor is tomorrow's vapor.
He'd have more power as a martyr. No, to destroy Batman we must first turn him into what he hates most. Meaning, us.
Y'mean frame him?
You're quick. Mayor Cobblepot.
Thanks. Jeez. Not used to this man-woman, cat-mouse business. Generally the babes flock to me, I tell 'em take a number.
You're off the hook, Ozzie. But Batman is decidedly <u>not</u>.
He napalmed my arm. He knocked me off a building just when I was starting to feel good about myself. I want to play an integral part in his degradation.
Well, a plan <u>is</u> forming ... A vicious one, involving the loss of innocent life ...

You buy this "blurry" business?
Women... nothing surprises me, Chip. Excepting your late mother... Who even knew Selina had a brain to damage? Bottom line: she tries to blackmail us, we drop her out a higher window. Meanwhile I got badder fish to fry. Yeah -- Oswald, please.

Actually this is all just a bad dream. You're home in bed. Heavily sedated, resting comfortably, and dying from the carcinogens you've personally spewed in a lifetime of profiteering. Tragic irony or poetic justice? You tell me.

Quiet, Max. What do you think, this is a conversation?
What, is that supposed to "hypnotize" me?
No, just give you a splitting headache.
No, just give you a splitting headache.
Well it's not working.
Most of all, I want to find out who I am. By finding my parents. Learning my "human" name. Simple stuff that the good people of Gotham take for granted.
And exactly <u>why</u> am <u>I</u> gonna help <u>you</u>?
Yawn. That coulda come from anywhere.
What about the documents that prove you own half the firetraps in Gotham?
What about the documents that prove you own half the firetraps in Gotham?
If there were such documents -- and that is not an admission -- I would have seen to it they were shredded.
A lot of tape and a little patience make all the difference. By the way, how's Fred Adkins, your old partner?
Fred. Fred? He's ... actually he's been on an extended vacation, and --
You know what, Mr. ... Penguin-Sir? I think perhaps I could help orchestrate a little welcome-home scenario for you. And once we're both back home, perhaps we can help each other out ...
You won't regret this, Mr. Shreck.
Don't look, Oswald. It's a surprise.
A big bag of fan mail? Filthy lucre? Wait don't tell me ... Is it a broad?
Bu ... wh ... I ... I mean ...

That's fine, Oswald. But to get the Mayor recalled, we still need a catalyst, a trigger, an incident. Like the Reichstag fire, the Gulf of Tonkin.

Precisely. But they must come and go via the plumbing ducts that I've provided. That shall be as sacred as the separation between church and state.
... Want 'em to go apeshit. Nutso. Ballistic ... Do permanent damage to little old ladies. Loot, pillage, annoy people in a big way ... <u>Sounds</u> fun. But I ...

Point is, listen to them. They've lost faith in old symbols. They're ready to bond with you, the icon of the future. If it works, don't fix it...
Max! Relax! Josh and Jen'll put a spin on this. We'll talk it over tonight, at your costume par--
I think you'd feel out of place at my party. You see, it's for winners.
You're coming with me, you Great White Dope! To die, way down in the sewer!
Not Chip! Please! Penguin ... If you have one iota of human feeling, you'll take me instead.

I don't. So, no.

I'm the one you want! Penguin, please! Ask yourself: Isn't it Max Shreck who manipulated and betrayed you? Isn't it Max, not Chip, whom you want to see immersed up to his eyeballs in raw sewage?
Okay, you have a point. Plus, the hysterics are getting on my nerves.
Working late? I'm touched.
No, I am. Yes, I'm boning up for your Bruce Wayne meeting in the morning. I pulled all the files on the proposed power plant, and Mr. Wayne's hoped-for investment... I've studied up on all of it ... I even opened the protected files and --
Why, how industrious. And how did you open protected files, may I ask?
Well I figured that your password was "Finster." Your Pomeranian. And it was. And it's all very interesting, though a bit on the technical side, I mean about how the power plant is a power plant in name only since in fact it's gonna be one big giant...
Big giant <u>capacitor</u>. And that, instead of generating power it'll sort of be -- -- <u>sucking</u> power, from Gotham City, and storing it ... stockpiling it, sort of? Which, unless I'm being dense, is a novel approach, I'd say.
And who ... would you say this <u>to</u>?
... Where did curiosity get the cat?
I'm no cat. I'm just an assistant. A <u>secretary</u> --
I'm no cat. I'm just an assistant. A <u>secretary</u> --

Too good?
It's our secret. Honest. How can you be so mean to someone so meaningless?
I must protect my interests, Ms. Kyle. And Interest Number One, is <u>moi</u>.
Okay, go ahead. Intimidate me, bully me if it makes you feel big. I mean, it's not like you can just kill me.
Actually, it's a lot like that.
Selina?! Selina ... Selina ...
That's my name, Maximillions. Don't wear it out, babe, or I'll make you buy me a new one.

Ten years. Barbara isn't really me niece, sir. She's Joanna Clark's daughter.
Joanna and I were in love in London. But when I realized our age difference was too extreme -
Uncle Alfred left for America. Much to my mother's dismay -

Eventually she married a young physician.
You certainly will not.
Oh no, those things frighten me.
I'm sorry, Uncle, I came to tuck you in. And...
You came to tuck me in. That's quite a switch. I am looking for my brother, Wilfred. He is first butler to the Maharajah of Mirajanpore. But Mirajanpore is a floating court, it travels across India, so Wilfred can be rather difficult to find.
I guess they don't have fax machines on elephants.
I have been trying to reach Wilfred with no success. As one grows older, one yearns for family.

It's good to see you again, Uncle. I've missed you.
It's good to see you again, Uncle. I've missed you.
As I've missed you. Sleep well, child.
I'm sorry. I was too late.
Too late for what, dear child?
Too late for what, dear child?
I came to give you your freedom, a chance to live the life you choose. The same gift you gave me.
I came to give you your freedom, a chance to live the life you choose. The same gift you gave me.
I have been part of the greatest adventure ever know. I have found purpose here, and the family I could never have.
Find my brother Wilfred. Give him This. I have duties he must fulfill in my stead. Only family can be trusted.
What is it?
What is it?
It is the hearts of two good men whom I have had the honor of calling son. Take it, child. But I implore you, never open it. You look so like your mother.
Uncle Alfred?
In spirit only, I'm afraid.
In spirit only, I'm afraid.
The boys need help.
He's over-eager, impulsive. I can't trust him not to get hurt.
Perhaps the truth is you don't really trust anyone.
Perhaps the truth is you don't really trust anyone.
Don't tell me you're on his side. Again.
Don't tell me you're on his side. Again.
Despite all your talents, you are still a novice in the ways of family. Dick follows the same ends as you but gets there by his own course. You must learn to trust him. For that is the nature of family.
I must have dozed off. My sincerest apologies, sir.
No apology necessary. That's the first time in thirty years.
You have?
Secrets are a virtual prerequisite in this house, don't you think?
Well, I hope you'll stay with us.
There's a lovely inn just down --
Oh, but, sir. So much goes on-
Don't be silly, Alfred. After all, she's family.
Congratulations on your apprehension of Mr. Freeze. Batman monopolized the evening news.
Thanks.
Is there something wrong, sir?
Alfred, am I pigheaded? Is it always my way or the highway?
Alfred, am I pigheaded? Is it always my way or the highway?
Why, yes, actually. Death and chance stole your parents. But rather than become a victim, you have done everything in your power to control the fates. For what is Batman if not an effort to master the chaos that sweeps our world, an attempt to control death itself.
But I can't can I?
No, my boy. I'm afraid none of us can.
I am as well as can be expected.
Alfred, I know you're sick -- I can get you the best doctors.
Alfred, I know you're sick -- I can get you the best doctors.
I've seen the best doctors--! A gentleman does not discuss his health. It's not civilized. I hope I've taught you at least that much, young man.
Have you ever regretted your life working here, Alfred?
Attending to heroes? No sir. My Only regret is that I was never able to be out there with you.
Attending to heroes? No sir. My Only regret is that I was never able to be out there with you.
Not all heroes wear masks.
Alfred, if I've never told you...I just want to say...
Yes?
I've spent my whole life trying to beat back death. What good are all my heroics now if I can't save you?
Everyone dies, Master Bruce. There's no defeat in that. Victory comes in fighting for what we know is right while we still live.
I love you, old man.
Remember this. And remember it always. I'm proud of you. And I love you too, son.
Alfred, old friend, I could use your help right now.
Right here, sir.
It's good to see you.
What seems to be the problem?

Rather disappointed at how poorly I taught you proper housekeeping. And quite well, it seems. Thanks to you, son. Thanks to you all.

My parents were killed in an auto accident ten years ago. Alfred has been supporting me ever since.
I could have made it, you know. I didn't need your help.
Whatever you say, lady. It's all in a day's work for me.
This is to replace the bike I lost. I'll get you the rest.
Keep it.

I started racing after my parents died. There was something about the speed, the danger, that took me out of myself, that made the hurt go away. You wouldn't understand.
You'd be surprised.

Street racing isn't exactly an acceptable major at Oxbridge. They kicked me out. it doesn't matter. I've won enough money to do what I've always dreamed.

Just don't tell me you're hoping to run away and join the circus.
Alfred has supported me my whole life. Now I'm going to pay him back. I'm going to liberate him from his dismal life of servitude.
What are you talking about?

After you have frozen, your icy tomb will plummet back to Gotham.
Freeze, you're mad. This capsule will slaughter thousands.
Mr. Bane, I'll finish off the city. You, as they say in showbiz, are on. Take the boys and kill the kids. But bring me the Bat.
We have eleven minutes to stop Freeze And thaw the city.
You're loosing your cool

Well...um...her.

He needs extreme cold to survive. His cryo-suit uses diamond enhanced lasers to keep him at zero degrees.

Kill them. Of course. But why stop there? Why should only Batman and Robin die while the society that created them goes unpunished?
Yes. I shall replay the world for sentencing me to a life without the warmth of human comfort. I will blanket the city in endless winter. First Gotham and then the world.
Just what I had in mind. Everything dead on Earth except us. A chance for mother nature to start again. Plants and flowers are the oldest species on the planet yet they are defenseless against man. Sorry hon, this is for science. Behold the dawn of a new age.
I have created a race of plants with the strength of the deadliest animals. Once you have frozen mankind, my mutants will overrun the globe. The Earth will become a brave new world of only plants. And we shall rule them. For we will be the only two people left in the world.
Adam and Evil.
You will distract the bat and bird while I prepare to freeze Gotham.
Can't we just ice them along with the rest of the citizenry?

...Would it be a terrible imposition to ask you to take better care of your equipment?
Then you'd have nothing to complain about.

Hardly a worry, sir.
How's the sonar coming, Alfred?
A few hitches sir, but I'm confident we'll have a prototype in no time.

Do you remember the night I fell into that cave and the bat chased me?
Your parents' wake. Rain fell like tears.
Your parents' wake. Rain fell like tears.
...The night Batman was born. What was I doing in the fields that night, Alfred? What sent me running out into that storm? I keep dreaming about it but I just can't remember.

I don't know, sir. Your dear parents. Suddenly gone. So much loss...
I don't know, sir. Your dear parents. Suddenly gone. So much loss...
I remember the bat, though. His scream. Those eyes. i was sure the fear would kill me. In time I came to believe that if I became a monster, that if I was feared, I wouldn't be scared anymore. I was wrong. They think I became Batman to fight crime. I became Batman to fight the fear. And instead I became the fear.
Gee, I'm not sure. Alfred? How many rooms? Total?
Ninety-three, including the sauna.
Ninety-three, including the sauna.
Take any three you like. After you get settled we can...
It's happening again. Just like my parents. A monster comes out of the night. A scream. Two gunshots. I killed them.
What did you say?

He killed them. Two-Face. He slaughtered that boy's parents.

No. You said I. I killed them.

Sorry to bother you, sir. I have some rather distressing news about Master Dick.
Is he all right?

I'm afraid Master Dick has... gone traveling.

_No_, sir. _The_ _other_ _car_!
Too much wealth. Too fast. Half of Gotham zombied-out. A technology that self destructs. He's protecting more than industrial secrets, Alfred.
I shall be near at hand. Should you need me. And sir, I know it's difficult but try and have a good time.
Maybe they're right.
Which `they' might that be, sir?
Which `they' might that be, sir?
Jack Napier's dead. My parents are avenged. The Wayne Foundation contributes a small fortune to police and crime prevention programs.
Why do I keep doing this?
Why, indeed?

Could I let Batman go? For Dick. For me. Could I leave the shadows? Have a life. Friends. Family...

Dr. Meridian...
She's the first woman in a long time that's... No. She's the first woman ever. And she loves Batman. Not Bruce Wayne. If I let go of Batman I'll lose her.
Perhaps. Perhaps not. Why not ask the lady?
Perhaps. Perhaps not. Why not ask the lady?
How? As Batman, knowing she wants me? Or as Bruce Wayne and hope...?
How are you feeling, young man?
Not that young. It's been a long time since you've called me that.

As well as can be expected, I guess. Give me the bad news.

Dick has run away. They have taken Dr. Meridian. And I'm afraid they found the cave, sir. It's been destroyed.
I'm Batman? I remember my life as Bruce Wayne. But all this. It's like the life of a stranger.
Perhaps the fall...

He's home. I sent the signal.
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
Last night at the circus. I noticed something about Dent. His coin. He's obsessed with justice. It's his Achilles' heel. It can be exploited.

Did Two-Face call him Bruce?
Welcome to my parlor said the Riddler to the Bat. How's tricks?
No more tricks, Edward. Release Chase and Dick. This is between you and me.
Death. Death. Without taste, sound and all around us. Because there is no way for me to save them or myself. This is one giant death trap.
Excellent. See. Who says a guy in a rubber suit can't be smart? Well, it's been grand. Sorry you all have to die now.

Sorry. I haven't even had time to unpack. Instant coffee okay?

My parents are laid out in the library. Their skin smells like talcum powder. I'm so small. My father's diary is on his desk like always. I'm opening the book. Reading. I'm running out into the storm. The book is in my hands. I can't hear my screams over the rain. I'm falling...

I always thought it was the bat that scared me that night that changed my life. But it wasn't. The real fear was hiding underneath: what I read in the journal, that my parents' deaths were my fault. That's what I couldn't remember. That's the crime I've been paying for all these years.

I figure telling that cop I'd stay here saved me a truckload of social service interviews and good will. So no offense but thanks. See ya.

Absolutely not.

So not everyone can be a poet. Still, I respect the sentiment.
No. Wait...
Addictive isn't it? Just Say No. Until I say yes. A little fringe benefit of working with me. Now here's the concept, counselor. Crime. My I.Q., your AK-47. You help me gather production capital so I can produce enough of these to create an empire that will eclipse Bruce Wayne's forever. And, in return I will help you solve the greatest riddle of all.
Where are you sending Batboy this time?
Here. Get a good seat.
Sure, E = MC squared. Until you factor in more than three dimensions. Then... Damn. Hit us again.

Kill me? Well, alright. Go ahead. Take the empire. All yours. Hell, Harv, old pals. I'll kill me for you.
Go ahead. You can say it.

I know the feeling. It won't last. He's a long way ahead of where I was at his age.
Respectfully, sir... there'll never be another one like you.
How long's it been, Alfred? A quarter of a century? It seems like yesterday. I guess we ended up doing more harm than good.
Don't ever say that, sir. Don't ever believe it.
Don't ever say that, sir. Don't ever believe it.
If not for you I never would've made it. You know that. My own parents couldn't have... ... The boy, Alfred. You'll both be provided for. Don't let all this got to waste.
Like your boyfriend. He's kinda hot.
Take me. Let the boy go.
Take me. Let the boy go.
Gosh, I could kill you, but then you'd miss my party. And you, Batman -- you're the guest of honor!
Gosh, I could kill you, but then you'd miss my party. And you, Batman -- you're the guest of honor!
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
Batman! Don't you even recognize your old pal Jack? After all... ... You made me what I am today.
You know, we should've sat down and had us a little heart-to-heart. I bet we would have got on famously.
... Murderer...
... Murderer...
Bruce, we're both murderers. Think how many people you've killed by letting me live.
GET IN THE CAR!!
WHICH CAR?
Look! Police!
I know. I called them.
I know. I called them.
Shouldn't we --
What about the girl?
He won't kill her. -- GODDAMMIT!
Can't we --
Too many people. Come on! SHIELDS!!
How much do you weigh?
... A hundred and eight?
...Not even a 'thank you'?
Well -- I think you might consider
I'll have to ask you for that film.
I just wanted to distract them. I wasn't trying to get a picture of you.
Please.
I won't let you have it.
The Joker is a murderer. And you were as good as dead. So --
Look, I appreciate what you did for me. But this is my job. And I'm keeping those pictures.
Look, I appreciate what you did for me. But this is my job. And I'm keeping those pictures.
All right, I'll develop the photos. Anything I don't want is yours.
All right, I'll develop the photos. Anything I don't want is yours.
How do I know you won't keep them all?
How do I know you won't keep them all?
I'll take you with me.
Thank you, Vicki.
... Where are you taking me?
... How long have I been out?
Quite a while. I took the scenic route.
Quite a while. I took the scenic route.
Well, I've certainly enjoyed it. -- What's that?
What is this stuff? Kevlar?
Better. It's not on the market yet.
Better. It's not on the market yet.
It doesn't protect your head, though.
It doesn't protect your head, though.
That's why I wear a target on my chest.
How'd you find this place?
Exploring. In the woods. Many years ago. -- I was a solitary child.
They don't come down here. They're afraid of the lights.
I loathe bats.
I loathe bats.
So did I, once. But I kept coming back, and... I guess I became the thing I feared most.
What is that?
Photo database. I'll do your photos now.
They've got it all wrong. They're watching the warehouses, the loading docks, looking for a tamperer. The Joker is supplying tainted ingredients at the source.
That can't be right. That would mean every shipment of every product is poisoned. We'd all be dead.
That can't be right. That would mean every shipment of every product is poisoned. We'd all be dead.
No. Every product contains one component. The elements react in combination. Hair spray won't do it. But hair spray and perfume and lipstick will. Untraceable. It's very elegant.
I just can't absorb it all. This place, the equipment. What it must have cost. Why all the secrecy? Why do you wear the mask?
I don't want to jeopardize anyone close to me.
I don't want to jeopardize anyone close to me.
If you don't mind my asking... Who's close to you?
Is this what you wanted?
You could've killed him, you know. You could've killed the Joker.
You could've killed him, you know. You could've killed the Joker.
I had to save you, Vicki. I -- -- Please trust me.
I assume in my usual charming manner I've just insulted the host. Alexander Knox.
Bruce Wayne. -- I've read your work. I quite like it.
Bruce Wayne. -- I've read your work. I quite like it.
Great. Give me a grant.
Great. Give me a grant.
I might consider it if you introduce me to Miss Vale.
"This is Miss Vale." -- That felt redundant.
You're just back from Corto Maltese. I saw your combat photos. Quite a departure for you.
That's how it is, chum. One column - and I can bring all this tumbling down. I can take you off the streets for good.
What is it you want?
What is it you want?
I want you to hang up the suit. And I want you to stay away from Vicki.
I want you to hang up the suit. And I want you to stay away from Vicki.
I can't do that. Not while the Joker's still at large.
I can't do that. Not while the Joker's still at large.
Then stay away from Vicki. That's all I want, man. I just want your word.
See, I don't know how it happened... she's a smart girl and you are an extraordinary screwed-up guy... but she's in love with you.
Tell me, Knox. If you've got the story, why haven't you printed it?
Tell me, Knox. If you've got the story, why haven't you printed it?
Because I... ... Because she'd never speak to me again.
Do you want a drink?
Yeah, a drink. 'Civilized,' right?
Yeah, a drink. 'Civilized,' right?
Alfred, bring something for Mr. Knox -- I'll have one, too.
I don't... seek publicity -- Will you be staying in Gotham for a while?
As far as I know.
As far as I know.
Good. With any luck we'll run into each other.
Do you sail?
Too much work. I'm not really the physical type -- Thank you, Alfred.
Two drinks and I start swinging from the rooftops. Look, I bore myself silly. Let's talk about you. How the hell did you wind up in Corto Maltese?
That's a tough one. Have you ever seen combat?
That's a tough one. Have you ever seen combat?
No.
No.
Neither had I. Odd desire for a woman, I guess.

Odd desire for anyone.

Well. A couple of years ago when their president was requesting aid I went down there for Newsweek. The beaches were nice. And at nights -- they had a band -- I danced on the hotel patio. Of course I never saw what was really happening there. When the war broke out I had to go back. And I promised myself that this time...

What did you see?
What did you see?
... Terror.
There's terror everywhere. If you train yourself to look for it.
Well, Bruce, some types are a little more obvious than others.
Bruce, really, when I say these things I don't mean to criticize you.
In other words, what right do I have to talk about terror.
In other words, what right do I have to talk about terror.
As much as I do. It's not that. I don't want to be depressing, that's all.
As much as I do. It's not that. I don't want to be depressing, that's all.
I see. If I know how you really feel, I won't like you as much.
I'm sorry, Bruce, I Just can't seem to get a handle on this conversation.
Vicki, if I say anything cryptic, or... ambiguous, I think you should put the most flattering possible interpretation on it. Because even if it doesn't sound that way... that's how I'll mean it.
But it's not fair. I'm half drunk and you're not even --
I'll take you home if you'd like.
I'll take you home if you'd like.
God. You would. Come on, Bruce. I just want to get two drinks in you. As an experiment.
God. You would. Come on, Bruce. I just want to get two drinks in you. As an experiment.
Maybe we should just kiss.
Maybe we should just kiss.
... We could try that.
I don't sing very well.
Then there's one thing in the world you don't do very well. And I know what it is -- Now you'll have to kill me.
To tell you the truth, I'd just about given up waiting.
I said I'd call you the minute I got free. And I did -- And here we are.
I said I'd call you the minute I got free. And I did -- And here we are.
Mm-hmm. Lunch. Not even dinner.
All street mimes should be executed.
... Looks like a convention.
I know it's late. I -- Are you there?
Yes, Bruce -- I'm here --
Yes, Bruce -- I'm here --
I'm sorry I had to stand you up today. I'd like to make it up to you.
I'm sorry I had to stand you up today. I'd like to make it up to you.
Well, Bruce -- I don't think -- that would be possible.
Well, Bruce -- I don't think -- that would be possible.
I realize... the way things have gone between us... ... I wish you'd reconsider.
I realize... the way things have gone between us... ... I wish you'd reconsider.
I wish you'd...
Vicki?... This is Batman. I thought I'd call and see how you're doing.
... I know it's you, Bruce. I'm not going to talk to you unless we can discuss it...
... I know it's you, Bruce. I'm not going to talk to you unless we can discuss it...
Who's this 'Bruce'? Are you trying to make me jealous?
Who's this 'Bruce'? Are you trying to make me jealous?
I'm serious, Bruce. We have to -- !
So we just pretend none of this ever happened. We never met. We -- -- You're going to get yourself killed, Bruce. You know that, don't you?
No one would miss me.
No one would miss me.
I don't understand it. You can do so much good for people. As Bruce Wayne.
Money makes money, Vicki. The foundation runs itself -- I'm extraneous to the process.
You're one man. You can't save everybody.
You're one man. You can't save everybody.
What if I could save a handful? -- What if I could save one?
Bruce, at the rate you're going, you can't even save yourself.
Sometimes... I don't know if there's enough of me left to save.
It's like the last time. He sent me a present before he --
Very thoughtful. Don't touch it.
Oh, Bruce. Don't tell me you carry it around with you.
I feel naked without it.
"It worked for Van Gogh. Let's kiss and make up."
The does it. It's going to be this weekend.
Keep her on the line!
... Where are you calling from?
I'm sorry, she hung up. What are --
Finding out where she is.
Finding out where she is.
How can you do that if she's already off the line?
How can you do that if she's already off the line?
I've had an automatic tracer on this number ever since he tracked you to the museum.
Got it!
What now?
What now?
Hang on. I have to leave a message.
All this apparatus, Vicki... This house, and the money, and the power ... It was never mine. It was something I inherited. Bruce Wayne was something I inherited. All I ever hoped for was someone who could see through Bruce -- who could see me -- and not be frightened.
I'm frightened of you, Bruce. I'm frightened for you.
I'm frightened of you, Bruce. I'm frightened for you.
In all these years... Why couldn't I see how it wold turn out?
I don't know why I'm doing this. I half wish you'd stay a cripple.
Ohhhh... You don't mean that.
Ohhhh... You don't mean that.
I don't, but... I do. It's just... I love you, Bruce. I don't want you to...
I don't, but... I do. It's just... I love you, Bruce. I don't want you to...
Vicki. Do you love half of me? Or all of me?
We'll raid the Ace the moment we get a warrant.
He'll be ready when you do. Remember what happened at the apartment.
He'll be ready when you do. Remember what happened at the apartment.
All right, Bruce, what do you suggest?

I suggest a nice big bomb.

Good. A bomb. On a blind tip from Bruce Wayne -- We do have laws.

Sorry. We had another bat sighting.

Don't let your job interfere with your business. -- Someone's been talking to Harvey Dent.
I'm on top of it. If there's a problem --
Eckhardt... our problems are your problems.
I answer to Grissom, punk. Not to you.
Why, Eckhardt. You should be thinking about the future.
Got it all figured, huh? Grissom just sits back and hands you the reins. -- Maybe he don't know what we know.
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
About how pretty you are, pretty boy. Maybe he'd like to know --
Let's beat it, man. I don't like it up here.

No shit. It was all over the pavement.
There was no blood, man. My brother says... all the bad things you done... they come back and haunt you...
God! How old are you? There ain't no bat.
My brother's a priest, man.
No wonder you're such a chickenshit. Now shut up. There ain't no bat.
You shouldn'ta turned the gun on that kid, man. You shouldn'ta --
Do you want this money or don't you? Now shut up! Shut up --
Okay, a break-in. Trash the office, make off with the books ... "Industrial espionage."
Very good idea, Jack. In fact -- -- I'd like you to handle this operation personally.
Why do you need me to handle a simple break-in?
Because I want someone I can trust.
I understand.
Oh, Jack. -- Don't forget your lucky deck.
It's me. "Sugar Bumps."
Jack? Thank God. I can't believe it's you. I heard you'd been --
Jack? Thank God. I can't believe it's you. I heard you'd been --
Is that what you "heard"?
It's not the girl, Jack. Sooner or later you would've tried to take me. You may get me now, but your life won't be worth a dime.
I've died once already. It wasn't so bad -- In fact I recommend it.
Jack, listen -- we'll cut a deal --
JACK? JACK? DO I LOOK LIKE A JACK?
Jack - - please - - WIPE THAT LUNATIC GRIN OFF YOUR FACE.
HA! That's the best part. I CAN'T!!
I don't like taking orders from Grissom. And I especially don't like taking orders from Grissom's goon.

Huh. Demands. Well, gents, this is kinda embarrassing, but... I'm having such a swell time, I just haven't thought any up.
All right, then. Here's the deal. Total amnesty... and the sum of ten million dollars, payable in --
Ten million dollars. Ten mi -- YOU CHEAPSKATES! I've just wiped out the stock market. I've cost you billions! I want ten million and one.

Goddammit, I expect to be treated like and ARTIST. GET OFF MY SCREEN!!
... Thank you.
Unfortunate, but I think we can work around it.
And you want a --
A visual record, yes. A before-and- after kind of thing. This could make your reputation.
Maybe we should start with a portrait of the artist. People might like to see the face behind the makeup.
... Behind the makeup?
I've seen worse. Much worse.
Strong stomach, huh? I like that in a woman -- Maybe we can do business after all.
... Why the mask?
Alicia! Come here, have a seat. Show Miss Vale why you wear the mask.
You SCUM! You SICK FILTH!... You DID THAT to her!
What? I improved her a little...
I'll see you burn. I'll see you dead -- GET AWAY FROM ME!!
Miss Vale, was it something I said? Do you want to sniff my flower?
How'd you know it was me?
Honey - - I would know any randomly selected square inch of Vicki Vale. If I had a good enough hint.
Burned out. I need a vacation.
Too much glamor, huh. What's in the bag - - Monte Carlo? Apes in Kenya?
God, Vick, a girl could get hurt doing this.
A girl could get killed - - so they tell me. What's new and hot in Gotham City?

Oh, absolutely. Bruce and I are very close.
No.
Well, I'm starving. Will you at least buy me a hamburger?
Man, I feel like Robin Leach. You actually know all these people?
Some. I am a rich bitch, remember? I'm quoting.
Where does one man get all this junk?

Yum, yum.
Yum, yum.
Well, he must like the way he looks. He's got a mirror in every room.
Guess who's got a date with Bruce Wayne?
Bruce Wayne? Date? He called you up and asked you for a date? Shit. HEY, MIRANDA! C'MERE! Now pay close attention to this. Miranda -- tell my friend here what you told me about Bruce Wayne.
Peanuts?
Yeah. Peanuts. Which is how he goes through women.
Plain or roasted? Alex, I'm very flattered that you've gone out and done all this research.
Why? Aw, come on, Vicki, I'm a reporter. I'm curious. I do this for a living. There's a phone. You can call him up and cancel.
Nice snap, huh? Pulitzer Prize, 1963.
His face. Allie, look at his face.
Yep. He watched the whole thing happen - - Recognize the beat cop? Jim Gordon
Oh, Bruce...
Oh, Bruce...
Something like this -- what do you suppose this could drive a guy to?
You are on drugs.
Yeah? According to this, he's in Geneva from '76 to '79. Well, I called Geneva. Nobody there's even heard of the guy - - Probably off in Tibet with some kung fu master.

Bruce Wayne is out of his mind. Next time you call him up and he can't go out Friday night - - think it over.
The guy's bats all right. He's bat shit crazy. He -- -- I can't believe it. I was right!!
Allie, he's not.
Allie, he's not.
Not what?

He's not crazy.
Vicki. We got a wealthy millionaire here... who dresses up like a bat. He goes out at night and swings around -- in his cape -- on a rope. CRAZY BAT-STARD!

I said I'd check with you.
Do we know anything about him?
Ahm - he's male. He's English. He's a doctor of er ... at least 2 things. I think they would have mentioned if he was a blind dwarf. Or one of those guys who kills lots of people all the time. I think we're looking at someone moderately normal here.

What's wrong with you, David? All you have to do is say, Excuse me, I've been sitting here since the start of the Millennium and I'd really like some action from you before the end of the world. I'll go.
It isn't working any more, David.
I know - I'11 take it in to George tomorrow'- he'll fix it. Stupid thing.
Jesus.
I need some time, David. A little time. It's not just you. It's partly me.
Go ahead.

Your face smells like a foot.
Shut up, Kevin. Honey, you-re not making sense ...

Everything's gonna be fine.
About Charles...
shhh...
It was nothing. We're not ... He just makes me laugh. When was the last time we laughed? Any of us?
It was nothing. We're not ... He just makes me laugh. When was the last time we laughed? Any of us?
I know... I know. I've been an arsehole of spectacular proportions. Olympic standard.
Maybe I ought to think about getting another job.
Good idea - with a boss who's a really ugly son-of-a-bitch.
Here, let me do that.
No, I'm fine.
He's not too bad. I can live with him.
I'm afraid you don't know the half of it. Sit down. I have a tale to tell. And not a happy one.
Two dollars please.
Annie, it's me.
Annie, it's me.
Oh, right, yeah. two dollars please.
Oh, right, yeah. two dollars please.
No, Annie, no. This is Doctor Bean. He's going to be working with us.
He doesn't like to say much does he?
Right first time.
Right first time.
I can understand THAT. Neither do I.
Excuse me. Mr Grierson called down. He's ready to see you upstairs.
Thanks, Annie.
Goodnight Annie.
Night.
Big day today, huh? 78
Uh ... yes ...
David. There's a call for you. It's your wife.
Great. Classic timing. Why don't you ask her just to leave a date for the divorce? I'll check my diary later.
Ah, Mr Bean ...
Excuse me.
Better go. Grierson hates people being late.
Yes. Ahm... think I'11 ...
Seems to be a problem with the door. Where's the picture gone?
Ahm.....
Ahm.....
What? What?
Oh Jesus. Oh God. Oh Jesus God. Oh Mary Mother of Jesus. Oh Jesus of Nazareth.
oh dear.
oh dear.
What happened?!!!
What happened?!!!
Ahm.... .
Oh yes.
Whistler was a great painter, but he wasn't a great chooser of paints ....
It wasn't a dream, was it. I have to go in to work and tell them Whistler's Mother now looks like Danny De Vito.
Well, Ahm....
It's very good Bernie.
But the particular glory of the system... is that it can also work oh large screens in each individual room - so we can network the program to every room in the gallery.
I was hoping DU. Bean might take a look at my computer project today.
Yes. I'11 mention it to him. But ... he's kind of his own guy, you know?
Yes. I'11 mention it to him. But ... he's kind of his own guy, you know?
Howls he getting on with the family?
Howls he getting on with the family?
Ah. Fine. It's good. It's great.
And howls Alison?
She's ... well, she's good.
She's ... well, she's good.
Saw her at the movies the other night with that boss of hers. Nice guy. Good looking.
Saw her at the movies the other night with that boss of hers. Nice guy. Good looking.
Yes, isn't he.
Yes, isn't he.
It's great when people who work together can become real friends.
It's great when people who work together can become real friends.
Isn't it?
Look, I've left Bean on his own. Nice to chat though Bernie - always a subtle joy.
Thanks, David. Always a pleasure.
'Emergency measures, in your book means sack people right?
Not necessarily. That's where this ... comes in. No, I've had a better idea than sacking people. You'll hear soon enough.
Great day. At last we can start getting out of debt and concentrating on the future.
Yes, look, I wanted to talk to you about this. I'm sure we haven't been doing as badly as all that.
Yes, look, I wanted to talk to you about this. I'm sure we haven't been doing as badly as all that.
You're an innocent and an optimist David - that's why I love you. . Jesus - what a terrible tie- Come on, the Governor's coming at 3. And before then I have a little surprise for you and the Boss.
Everything okay, David?
Yes. Ahm. I was just wondering where my English house guest had got to.
Yes. Ahm. I was just wondering where my English house guest had got to.
He's just parking the Governor's car.
He's just parking the Governor's car.
Great - keep him out of trouble.
Look at all this - publicity expenditure ... catering ... all completely fictional ... back as far as June 93 ...
I don't think you really understand what you're looking at ...
Lord Walton assures me this guy's one of the very top scholars in the English art world. Has a couple of doctorates no less.
Great news.
So ... I'm wondering if one of you would have this guy stay in your home instead of some expensive hotel.
Love to, sir, but no can do. No spare room. Period.
Love to, sir, but no can do. No spare room. Period.
David?
We'll be able to start this afternoon. I'11 pipe the guide to every video screen in the gallery. Now, that'll impress the Governor.
Well, bravo! What with you and Whistler's Ma - I think I've got a winning team.
What a pleasure, Governor Reynolds. I'd like you to meet some of our staff here. .
And that's where you introduce me to the Governor.
And that's where you introduce me to the Governor.
Right. Got it.
This is Elmer, our longest serving...
Hey. Let's junk the medals, Elmer. This is not a Veterans' reunion. We wanna make the Governor feel at home. Not remind him of piles of dead people wearing uniforms.
Okay, that'll do. The Governor's here in half an hour. We have to be totally ready then. No excuses. Period!
Thank you Bernie. Well done. Now, If you'll excuse - I have a little smartening up to do myself.
He's a man with a plan who will haul us into profitability and the 21st century.
Thank you, sir. Although, I'm afraid I don't quite see how we can ...
Thank you, sir. Although, I'm afraid I don't quite see how we can ...
Good point Bernie - precisely the kind of perceptive interjection I'd expect from my new V.P. How can we, you ask, survive without Whistler's Mother - our single greatest asset? Well, the truth is - we can't. So what am I saying? Will we find her again? Never - this robber was clearly the work of a criminal of great genius.
Say that again, son.
I beg your pardon?
I beg your pardon?
I said say that again, son - because the next time you do, I'll make sure you're in there with my daughter, but in a slightly less healthy state and she's in a coma with a broken arm right now.
I said say that again, son - because the next time you do, I'll make sure you're in there with my daughter, but in a slightly less healthy state and she's in a coma with a broken arm right now.
I'm er ... sorry if you've been waiting a long time.
I'm er ... sorry if you've been waiting a long time.
We have. In fact, we've been sitting here since the start of the Millennium and I'd really like some action from you before the end of the world.
So, why not haul your ... nice little ass into this room and explain to me and my wife why our precious daughter is going to be absolutely fine because of all the fantastic intelligence and attention you are going to give her case.
Okay, sir. Certainly. Good.
Oh, look, I mean, it's kind of the last thing... I mean, I'd really like to, but... things at home are kind of sensitive, so I couldn't really er ...
I thought perhaps as Vice-President, and in view of the unfortunate attendance's for the summer show this year... the MASSIVE financial LOSS ...
I thought perhaps as Vice-President, and in view of the unfortunate attendance's for the summer show this year... the MASSIVE financial LOSS ...
on the other hand ... maybe a breath of fresh air is just what my family needs ... Yes. Great news. Fabulous. Triumphant. Course it might need a little smoothing over. When's he due?
Tomorrow. You have a problem with that?
No. Perfect. Looking forward to it. CUT TO:
Ah, David. Finally. And this must be our professor from across the sea.
Yes, this is Doctor Bean.
Ah... He certainly has something, sir.
Very pleased you've taken him in, David. At a time when no-one's job is safe, it really identifies you as a team player.
Very pleased you've taken him in, David. At a time when no-one's job is safe, it really identifies you as a team player.
Yes, although, I really..... thank you. Yes, it's great to have him with us. The whole family's very excited.

Glad to hear it. Tell poor Mr Larson to come through, will you?
Glad to hear it. Tell poor Mr Larson to come through, will you?
You're not going to ....
You're not going to ....
Sack him? David, what else can I do? This business is not, repeat, not breaking even. And David ... notice anything this morning?
No!
Er ... pray tell me why?
The thing is, sir, I've just been giving the painting a very thorough inspection, with the help of Dr Bean here - and we feel the time's come for Whistler's Mum to have her first face-lift.
Time taken its toll on the old girl, eh?
Time taken its toll on the old girl, eh?
Exactly. She's in a surprisingly terrible state. Isn't she, Bean?
Thank you David. However, flattery will get you nowhere. Truth is, I have a rather different plan for Whistler's dear Mama. Bernie and I have been inspecting our books - and the long and short of it is, we cannot survive with our current losses, so ...
... you have to sack me. I understand, sir. I'll go quietly. In fact I'll go right now.
... you have to sack me. I understand, sir. I'll go quietly. In fact I'll go right now.
No. no, no, hold on ... We cant sustain our loses - so I've decided.. to sell Whistler's Mother.
Brilliant, huh? I already have a prospective buyer - the current Governor of California, no less, who is flies in tomorrow to inspect her and clinch the deal. Spread the news. I think decisive leadership has done the trick, don't you?
Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Congratulations. Marvellous thing. Bravo.
I think you're wrong, David. She looks as fine as she's ever looked. Worth every cent of the 10 million dollar-s.
Ahm....
Ahm....
Bravo. Let's put on a good show tomorrow, shall we? Don't want anything to go wrong.
Bravo. Let's put on a good show tomorrow, shall we? Don't want anything to go wrong.
Quite right, sir.
Well, congratulations. Isn't that great, David?
Certainly is.
David, David, David ...
I'm fired? Because I let a... copy of a painting the get stolen?
I'm fired? Because I let a... copy of a painting the get stolen?
Of course not. I'm sacking you for neglectful conduct, relating to the heavy financial loss this gallery has incurred, through your recent lack of professional judgement. A loss I trust Bernie will be able to reverse.
I owe you a very serious apology, young man. It wouldn't surprise me if you wanted to leave us after this. I sincerely hope that you do not.
VERY ACCOMMODATING Well, no, sir, I'm sure ...
Of course.
And a car.
And a car.
Mmmmm...
Maybe two cars.
A car sounds sensible.
A car sounds sensible.
And I need Fridays off, to spend more time with my family. Speaking of which - if you'll excuse me .... I've got a lot of time to make up.
Oh come on - the guy's going to be a creep. All Englishmen are ugly.
What makes you say that?
What makes you say that?
All the guys they claim are English to and good-looking like Dan Day- Lewis and Liam Neeson, turn out to be Irish. Even Anthony Hopkins is welsh. Prince Charles is so ugly they pay him two million bucks a year to stay indoors.

Okay, so the guy's gonna look like Meatloaf's backside. No-one's asking you to go to bed with him.
Honey, calm down now... it's okay...
There's a man. I woke up next to a man ...
Jen - you don't wanna talk about it?
It's you and Mom that need to talk.
It's you and Mom that need to talk.
Sure. You're right.
Bye, Dad.
Ah ... Jennifer, I need you to watch Kevin. Jen?
As you can see, security's pretty tight in this section. Nobody gets past Elmer here. Isn't that right?
Not in one piece anyway. I see Mrs Whistler as kind of ... like my own dear mother. I'd kill any man that tried to interfere with her. The Vice President here will vouch for that.
You've known me five years Elmer. When do you get to calling me David?
Not my place, sir. It would only be a matter of time before I'm calling you Dave. Then where would we be? By next year, you're my Sweety-Pie" and I'm "Coochie-Coo". I'11 be back in 15.
You arrange those flowers yourself?
Sure did.
Sure did.
They're pretty. Learn it in the army?
They're pretty. Learn it in the army?
No - but when you've torn out a man's throat with your bare hands, you learn to appreciate the beautiful things in life.
Hiya Dad ~ I'll need you upstairs for homework in about .... oh, 20 minutes.
Great, good.
Who do you think is the ugliest guy who ever lived.
Well, Michael Bolton's pretty grisly.
Well, Michael Bolton's pretty grisly.
I vote for Bart.
He was incredible. This guy is fearless. He has no fear.
That's one - way of looking at it. You might also say this guy is brainless he has no brain'.

Well, there is that ...
Well, there is that ...
I'11 give you a chance... Know anything about computers?
Hey, En, nice bike'- but remember: any kids you have are gonna look just like its handsome driver.
Jennifer! This is not - repeat, not! how we do things in this family. I've told you never to get on one of those death traps! Please - talk to me. I promise to be reasonable.
Is Jenny gonna be okay?
She was wearing a helmet. It could have been worse.
She was wearing a helmet. It could have been worse.
But is she gonna be okay?
But is she gonna be okay?
How the hell should I know?
... in the distant future.
Bye, Bean. Thanks for everything. And take care, huh? I know it's insane, but I'm going to miss you.
Doctor Jacobson?
Yes?
Yes?
We need you urgently in C Theatre.

Damn. I was just going to Number 4 ....

Interesting suit.
Why thank you sir.
Why thank you sir.
off the peg?
off the peg?
Yes it is ... may I introduce you To Bern ...
I've known soldiers who've had their heads blown off who were more intelligent than you two. Not only have you failed to protect your most valuable possession from theft - but you didn't even know it'd been stolen! I'd sooner buy heroin from the guy who sells drugs outside my grandson's school than anything from you guys.
I am sorry you feel that way.
I am sorry you feel that way.
And I'm sorry you look that way, short-ass. That suit stinks and you obviously dye your hair.
Shut up, Kevin.
NO, seriously - I know he's your boyfriend, but there's something about his upper lip that is so weird. What do you think it is, Dad? Jen says it's a moustache, I say it's a cluster of about 11 mosquitoes, resting.

Nope.

You.
I wish I could use that at school. "Hey, Teach, no hard feelings ... It's just things between us ain't what they used to be and I need a little space, ya know? So I'11 see you around in a couple of years, maybe".
It's a kind of an interesting swap. Mom for the Man from Ga Ga.
You know, Mr. Bean's okay. You're not gonna kick him out, are you, Dad?
Of course he is.
Of course he is.
Are you?
Come on Sting!

You must bow down to the Almighty Bunghole. Heh heh, this is cool. Bungholio-o-o-o-o-o!
He's jerkin' us off. I think we're gonna have to take him out. Get ready to fire on my orders... This is your last chance. Give us the unit now...

Thrr...
We got nothing, Chief. We tore the place apart. We can only legally hold her for another couple of hours.
Dammit! Where's that damn unit??!!
Talk ta me, Bork.
Chief, we found a witness that says he saw two teenagers leaving Dallas' room shortly before we arrived.

Did you give him a full cavity search?

Ah, the witness?
Ah, the witness?
Yes. You can never be too careful Bork.
Yes. You can never be too careful Bork.
Well sir, I didn't really think it was necessary. You see we have a picture of them from the elevator security cam. Here, have a look.
They look like a couple of kids chief.
Bork, don't you realize what kids today are capable of? Don't you read the papers?
You see what I see, Bork?
I see it. I don't get it.
I see it. I don't get it.
You got half the state looking for ya - how do you get away?
You got half the state looking for ya - how do you get away?
Cut the power!
Cut the power!
Damn right. Bork, we're dealing with real pros here. My opinion, terrorists... What's the scoop on that stolen unit?
Damn right. Bork, we're dealing with real pros here. My opinion, terrorists... What's the scoop on that stolen unit?
Well, sir it's not good. Roll the tape... The X-5 unit is a new top-secret biological weapon, a manmade virus...
Jesus Jumped-Up Christ! If this were to fall into the wrong hands...
It gets worse. The unit wasn't finished. It has a flaw - the casing. If hit hard enough, it could break open, releasing the virus.
Cavity search...?
Deep and hard.
Chief, you know that guy whose camper they were whacking off in?
Bork! You are a federal agent. You represent the United States Government... Never end a sentence with a preposition. Try again.

Oh, ah... You know that guy in whose camper they... I mean that guy off in whose camper they were whacking?
Oh, ah... You know that guy in whose camper they... I mean that guy off in whose camper they were whacking?
That's better. Yes?
That's better. Yes?
We've run a sample through the National Criminal Sperm Bank and come up with two possible genetic matches for a father.
Well, I'll be a blue-nosed gopher.
Where did these guys come from?
What the hell...? Bork! That bus we picked up. Where was it headin'?
D.C., Chief.
D.C., Chief.
Jesus jumped-up... Bork, can you imagine what would happen if they set that thing off in our nation's capital, or even worse, if they sold it to some damned foreigner at that conference. Well, it's not gonna happen!
Okay, boys and girls, our suspects are on a tour bus we believe to be headed for... the White House! Jumpin' Jesus! I want everyone there. Our people. Locals. Orders are shoot to kill. Repeat! Shoot to kill!
Chief, I swear, we tore that bus apart. They couldn't have...
Chief, I swear, we tore that bus apart. They couldn't have...
Bork, when this is all over, remind me to make you an appointment with Agent Hurley.
Not on him, Chief.
Agent Hurley...
Say chief, isn't that guy whose camper,...I mean, off in whose...
Not now Bork.
We just cleared all four floors. No sign of him.
Damn! Where the hell is he? We should've found him by now.
Chief, look!
Attention all units. We've got him. He's in front of a camper in the visitor's lot.
OK, nobody shoot. He could still have the unit on him. Keep your distance. We don't wanna take a chance on hitting it.
Where are his pants?
Where are his pants?
Who knows?
Well, Earl said you guys were young, but jeez... Oh well, as long as you can get the job done. So what are your names?
Uh, Butt-Head.
Do her? Huh huh.
That's right. I'm offering you ten grand plus expenses to do my wife. We gotta deal?
Here she is. Her name's Dallas. She ain't as sweet as she looks. She stole everything from me. Ya gotta watch out, 'cause she'll do you twice as fast as you'd do her.
Whoa, huh huh. Cool.
She's holed up in a hotel room in Las Veags. Your flight leaves in a couple of hours. Now c'mon, I'll drive you to the airport.
Holed up. Huh huh huh. Holed.
One more thing. Mah wife's got this leather satchel. It's black, about this big. I need ya to bring it back. It's real important. Sentimental value... Any questions so far?
Uh, yeah. Does she have big hooters?
Uh, yeah. Does she have big hooters?
She sure does.
She sure does.
This is gonna be cool! Huh huh huh.
Ah'm gonna blow you both to hell!
Cool, huh huh. Hey Beavis that's that dude that's paying us to do his wife.
Cool. Huh huh huh.
It's so nice to meet young men who are so well mannered.
Cool, huh huh huh.
That's why I'm bussing it across America. I'm so glad you're here. Jim, I want you to meet two nice boys.
This is Travis and Bob... What's your last name, dear?
Uh... Head? huh huh. My first name's Butt. Huh huh huh.

Whoa, this kicks ass! Huh huh huh.
Yoo-hoo! Travis and Bob Head. Whoo-hoo!
Uh, hey. One of you kids got a match?
Uh, my butt and your...uh, butt.
You were a roadie for Motley Crue?
Yup. Huh huh.
Really? That's where we're from.
Well, then you know what I'm talking about. Anyway, here's the story. I scored with these two chicks. True story.
Well, then you know what I'm talking about. Anyway, here's the story. I scored with these two chicks. True story.
You scored with two chicks?!
You scored with two chicks?!
Yeah, they were sluts. Huh huh huh.
Shut up, dumb-ass! You didn't score. I scored with both of them...
Uh, do you think these two sluts still live in Highland? That would be cool.
Uh, do you think these two sluts still live in Highland? That would be cool.
Hey, you wanna see something really cool? Huh huh huh.

Uh, you want us to do a guy? Huh huh. No way.
Maybe I am three-eighty-five if you carry a second lien! I can arrange the most creative financing in the six states of New England.
No, Jane.
No, Jane.
You'll be rich!
You'll be rich!
We're rich in what really matters.
We're rich in what really matters.
Adam my booyy! When you're really rich in what matters... ... nothing matters! My buyer has just made a killing in condos in the Village. And he's got a little stress problem... ... so his wife says they want the old peace and quiet!

So do I, Jane. I'm on vacation.
So do I, Jane. I'm on vacation.
Does that mean you'd consider it in two weeks? You don't have to answer now. He wants me to check the deed restriction anyway. You take your vacation, Adam. Say 'bye!
Get <u>away</u> you little monster.
I will <u>never</u> sell this house. I'll be buried in my yard next to Barbara. Holding hands! And a good paintbrush!
She's ready.
Oh, Adam, the model looks so good. The Historical Society will love it. You've finished the streets?
Oh, Adam, the model looks so good. The Historical Society will love it. You've finished the streets?
Almost.
Manchurian Tung oil? Where did you get it?
Helen got it for me in Oslo.
Helen got it for me in Oslo.
God... Manchurian Tung oil? There's enough to refinish the gateleg table <u>and</u> the cherry wardrobe!
Yeah, I want to get one coat on the wardrobe and then I'll help you.
Oh, honey, I'm so glad we're spending our vacation at home.
Oh, honey, I'm so glad we're spending our vacation at home.
God, how I have looked forward to this, honey.
Oh no.
It's <u>your</u> turn, darling.
Jane said we should sell the house to someone with a family.
Ah, the ever-tactful Jane. Let's just relax about having children.
We should be flattered that she wants to sell our house.
I know... I just wish she'd leave us alone.
I know... I just wish she'd leave us alone.
Let's not think about it. We'll have a nice romantic, quiet, vacation. Here comes the bridge chorus.
Wave at the lion.
Don't forget the balls, Ernie.
Don't forget the balls, Ernie.
Adam!
Adam, your Bozman Building is a beauty.
Yeah it turned out okay. We applied for a National Historical plaque for it. That'll be the third one on Main Street.

You're doing it, Adam. You're saving this town.

Slow down there, honey... I don't want the vibration to weaken the model.
Slow down there, honey... I don't want the vibration to weaken the model.
Oh... I'm sorry...
This fire wasn't burning when we left the house.
How's your arm?
How's your arm?
I'm not sure. It feels... frozen.
You'd better sit down, hon.
I am sitting.
I am sitting.
I'll tell you what, Barbara. I don't think we survived that crash.
I'll tell you what, Barbara. I don't think we survived that crash.
Oh, Adam. We're home. In our own house. Nonsense. I'll make some coffee. You get some more firewood.
You saved my -- uh -- life... or whatever... something.
Two hours.
Two hours.
What?
What?
That's how long you were gone.
That's how long you were gone.
... Hmmm?
Anything happen while I was away?
Yes it did. Yes it did. I made a couple of small discoveries. Here's one.
Handbook for the recently diseased.
De<u>ceased</u>. I don't know where it came from.
De<u>ceased</u>. I don't know where it came from.
Look at the publisher. Handbook for the Recently Deceased Press.
I don't think we survived the crash.
This is going to take some time.
I don't like situations like this. I hate it when I'm not in control. So just tell me the basics.
This book isn't arranged that way. What do you want to know?
This book isn't arranged that way. What do you want to know?
There are a thousand things... Why did you disappear when you walked off the front porch? Is this a punishment? Are we halfway to heaven or are we halfway to hell? And how long is this going to <u>last</u>?
There are a thousand things... Why did you disappear when you walked off the front porch? Is this a punishment? Are we halfway to heaven or are we halfway to hell? And how long is this going to <u>last</u>?
I don't see anything about 'Rewards and Punishments' or 'Heaven and Hell.' This book reads like stereo instructions! Listen to this... 'Geographical and Temporal Perimeters... Functional perimeters vary from manifestation to manifestation.' This is going to take some time.
Cabin fever, hon?
I can't clean anything. The vacuum is out in the garage. I can't leave the house. Why don't they tell us something? Where are all the other dead people in the world? Why is it just you and me?

Maybe this is heaven.

In heaven there wouldn't be dust on the wallpaper.

Hon... I didn't want to die, but really, this is fine with me. As long as I never have to wash dishes again.
Hon... I didn't want to die, but really, this is fine with me. As long as I never have to wash dishes again.
Dishes? We haven't eaten in three weeks! Adam, I'm not like you, I really need to be around <u>people</u>, get out to the church and go grocery shopping.
Dishes? We haven't eaten in three weeks! Adam, I'm not like you, I really need to be around <u>people</u>, get out to the church and go grocery shopping.
But I'm not hungry, are you?
God, it's Jane Butterfield!
What's she doing here?
What's she doing here?
I don't know. <u>Jane, Jane, up here</u>!
She can't see you, right? In the book, Rule Number Two: the living usually won't see the dead.
Won't? Or can't?
Won't? Or can't?
Just says 'won't.' Wait a minute. Here it says 'the living are arrogant... they think they'll never die, so they refuse to see the dead.'
Just says 'won't.' Wait a minute. Here it says 'the living are arrogant... they think they'll never die, so they refuse to see the dead.'
Arrogant. That's Jane Butterfield all right...
Arrogant. That's Jane Butterfield all right...
At least we won't have to worry about her.
I guess... if I'm going to be dead, I'll just have to be the best dead person ever!
That's my girl!
Adam, we <u>are</u> in hell. I hate these people.
They make gypsies look good.
They make gypsies look good.
Is this a punishment for something we did in life? What can we do?
Is this a punishment for something we did in life? What can we do?
I don't know if there's anything we can do.
I don't know if there's anything we can do.
We're not completely helpless. I've been reading the book. There's a word for people in our predicament, honey.
Oh, honey, we may need that.
No, I'm not putting up with this.
Barbara, honey! Don't go out there. You don't know --
Whatever it is it can't be worse than this.
Oh, Adam, don't ever leave me alone.
<u>You</u> left me.
<u>You</u> left me.
I know. I'm sorry.
We're trapped in this house forever... with those... people.
You can't say that for sure. It could be a transitional thing. Like a post-life crisis. We just have to be tougher with them. Come on. Have some brandy. Spirits, get it?

Death didn't improve your sense of humor.
Look in the index... maybe there's, like an emergency number or something.
Not really... what's this?
That's it? No number, or instructions?
Nothing. The bio buster? I don't get it...
That little girl saw us.
She couldn't have. We can't <u>make</u> them see us.
She couldn't have. We can't <u>make</u> them see us.
But she <u>saw</u> us. I could feel it.
But she <u>saw</u> us. I could feel it.
That's all we need.
There's nothing we can do. It's just a matter of time before they unlock this room. There goes my model. There goes our last refuge.
We're not going to wait here like cornered animals. I can tell you that. We need help. I'm going to talk to that little girl.

We need some help. I found something this morning. Here. Emergencies. 'In case of emergency, draw door.'
Draw door? I don't know why we keep looking in that stupid book.
Yet another triumph for Adam and Barbara in the afterlife.
Wait.
... Not what I expected when we walked through that door.
No. But it's somewhere without big worms.
My God, we're back where we started.
Look at this, everything is different down here. All our furniture is gone.
Look at this, everything is different down here. All our furniture is gone.
How long do you suppose we were waiting?
We'd like some help in getting rid of the people who moved in here. Barbara and I worked very hard on this house.
We probably wouldn't mind sharing the house with people who were --
That guy is in our cemetery. Oh, Adam.
Look, she's right. We'll just start simple, honey, be tougher. I feel... confident. C'mon.
God, this is so corny. Have we been reduced to this? Sheets?
Think of them as death shrouds. And the moaning is important. Really <u>moan</u>! Practice, practice, practice.
I feel really stupid.
It's <u>not</u> stupid. We're ghosts. Do you want this woman for breakfast for 125 years? Moan louder!
Well, I don't know... We don't get many visitors.
Where are your skulls and bones?
Where are your skulls and bones?
You know you're really a pretty girl.
Lydia's trying, but they don't believe her.
She's got <u>photos</u>, Barbara.
She's got <u>photos</u>, Barbara.
Adam, you had a photo of Big Foot!
Adam, you had a photo of Big Foot!
This is different. Eventually she'll take someone to the attic. And then what? We've got to try to contact this guy Betelmyer. We gotta get some help, hon.
Did you copy these gravestones right, Adam?
Of course I did.
Of course I did.
Then it should be here.
Here's something.
I didn't do that one... Hmmm.
I didn't do that one... Hmmm.
... Yes this must be him. Look... Betelgeuse... Betelgeuse...
Go ahead... third time's a charm.
<u>Betelgeuse</u>!
What happened?
Three times. Powerful number.
Three times. Powerful number.
Bet... el... geuse. What an awful name. I thought it was like -- you know. The <u>juice</u> of <u>beetles</u>.
Has anything been simple so far? From the look of the shovel, we dig.
Oh, Adam. I don't have gloves. My nails keep getting longer. I'll break them.
I guess we open it.
Maybe we should knock first?
She's only fourteen...
... acts like she's thirty-five.
Honey. Let's go.
Go? What d'ya mean? We need help.
Go? What d'ya mean? We need help.
No, we don't. We can work something out ourselves. We just have to try harder.
Honey, I think that was a mistake.
I am not going to expose that little girl to that... pervert down there.

But <u>we</u> let him out.
But <u>we</u> let him out.
I don't care, I've changed my mind. ... I feel <u>really</u> confident. We're getting better at this stuff. We can scare them off ourselves -- tonight! I've got an idea. You're going to love it... I'm going to hate it.
And your sushi was remarkable.
The sushi? I did the wine. Didn't you do the sushi?
The sushi? I did the wine. Didn't you do the sushi?
N... No, I just did the Ink Spots.
N... No, I just did the Ink Spots.
Who did the sushi?
Maybe they'll leave now. That snake was a pretty nasty customer.
He might have hurt somebody.
He might have hurt somebody.
But he didn't. We've got him where we want him.
<u>Adam</u>! Why did you build a whorehouse? Have you ever been to...?
I didn't --
Lydia, believe me... we know... all the hard stuff is the same over here. You're going to be who you are... whether you're alive or dead ... and over here -- it's... It's flat... there's no food, no colors ... you can't smell the flowers. If we knew then what we know now we'd have been more careful...
... we wouldn't have had our little accident.
You know, I've been thinking. I could teach Lydia to sew.
Little black party dresses?
Little black party dresses?
Ah, Adam, you don't know anything about little girls. She's just... missed out on some love, that's all...
Ah, Adam, you don't know anything about little girls. She's just... missed out on some love, that's all...
Let's see if she can get my model back.
Let's see if she can get my model back.
You can build another one... with her.
We've been given a gift here, honey. A real live little girl. She likes us a lot. She needs us. Maybe that's why we died so young, to keep us from getting so... attached to <u>things</u>. The house, antiques, your model. Look at us. We didn't have room for anyone.
What makes you think she likes me?
What...?
Just a hunch.
What time is it?
3:30 I guess.
3:30 I guess.
Give or take a year.
Oh, Adam, don't tease her. You never got an A in science in your life!
All right.
A... Are you the guys who're hiding out in the attic?
We're ghosts.
Aren't you scared?
I'm not scared of Ralph Lauren. Those are <u>sheets</u>. Are you gross under there? Are you <u>Night of the</u> <u>Living Dead</u> under there? Like all bloody veins and pus?
I'm not scared of Ralph Lauren. Those are <u>sheets</u>. Are you gross under there? Are you <u>Night of the</u> <u>Living Dead</u> under there? Like all bloody veins and pus?
What?
What?
<u>Night of the Living Dead</u>? It's this gross movie.
You can actually see us? Without the sheets?
Is this like a trick question?
Nobody else can.
I'm wearing contacts... Also I read through <u>Handbook for the</u> <u>Recently Deceased</u>. It says that live people ignore the strange and unusual... not me... <u>I am</u> strange and unusual.
Why are you creeping around Delia's bedroom?
We were trying to scare your mother.
We were trying to scare your mother.
Stepmother. I'm very sensitive about being related to reptiles.
<u>You</u> did this? You carved all these little figures and houses and things?
I certainly did. I'd finish it too, but... I don't get out much.
I certainly did. I'd finish it too, but... I don't get out much.
And this used to be your house, I bet. Why do you want to scare everybody?
And this used to be your house, I bet. Why do you want to scare everybody?
We want to frighten you away. So that you'll move out.

You don't know the Deetzes very well, do you? My father bought this place. He never walks away from equity. Why don't <u>you</u> leave?
We weren't there. The handbook says funerals aren't for the dead.
God, if this is true this is like, amazing! I kinda like it up here. Can I visit you sometimes?
You tell them that we are desperate horrible ghoulish creatures who will stop at nothing to get back our house.
Wait a minute. I had some licorice ice cream earlier. You guys could be gas. What if... I'm dreaming. Can you do any neat tricks to prove you're not gas?
What is going on?
Really. I don't know.
Did you get the paint?
I got it. And I took pictures of the new church for you, too.
We studied all day yesterday. Don't tell me...
I got an A!
So can I?
Uh-uh. Only if you got <u>above</u> a C on science.
Uh-uh. Only if you got <u>above</u> a C on science.
Oh puh-leeze!
You don't have an appointment, do you?
W... We didn't know how to make one.
Nine months? What difference does that make?
Good luck. You're going to use up all your help vouchers.
Good luck. You're going to use up all your help vouchers.

Help vouchers?
D-90's. You spend a hundred and twenty-five years on earth, actually, in that house, during which you get only three class- one D-90 intercessions with Juno. You probably haven't even read through the manual completely yet.
Wait for who?
For Juno, your caseworker. Not that it matters to your type. But there <u>are</u> all these other people here ahead of you. I'd say three hours.
Aren't you dead?
Hell no! I'm rolling. I'm a businessman. I'm the man what <u>am</u>. <u>Beee</u>tel <u>Jooose</u>! <u>Who</u> do I gotta kill?
Hell no! I'm rolling. I'm a businessman. I'm the man what <u>am</u>. <u>Beee</u>tel <u>Jooose</u>! <u>Who</u> do I gotta kill?
You don't kill anyone.
<u>So</u> you, the dead, want me, <u>the</u> <u>undead</u>, to throw the live guys -- Mommie, Daddy and Lolita, who might not mind a tumble with an older guy, out into the cold? Even though they have paid hard casharoonie for your dump?
But... the Deetzes are <u>destroying</u> our house.

You Maitlands are the backbone of the afterlife. So what's my cut?
Can you scare them off?
Okay. But that Betelgeuse sure seemed mad.
Hi ho, hi ho, it's off to work I go!
This is <u>my</u> town.
You wish! I nearly scored with that little blonde. I need me a short little queen.
<u>Barbara</u>?!!
Now, let's get rolling!
Are you available?
No. What's wrong?
Hell is other people. You obviously don't read much. Besides things seem pretty quiet here. You should thank God you didn't die in Italy. The Deetzes. Okay. Have you been studying the manual?
We tried.
We tried.
The Intermediate Interface chapter on Haunting says it all. Get 'em out yourself. It's your house. Haunted houses don't come easy.
I heard. Tore your face right off! Bad news. It obviously doesn't do any good to pull your heads off in front of people if they can't see you.
We have to start simpler, is that it?
We have to start simpler, is that it?
Start simply. Do what you know. Use your talents. Practice. We only help those who help themselves. Just do a little at a time. And of course, practice, practice, practice. It's tricky but -- you weren't murderers by any chance, were you?
<u>Don't say his name</u>! Just practice. Do it <u>yourself</u>!
And if we need <u>you</u> again, how do we...?
Handbook? When...?
<u>Never trust the living</u>! We <u>cannot</u> have a routine haunting like yours provide incontrovertible visual proof of existence beyond death.
<u>Never trust the living</u>! We <u>cannot</u> have a routine haunting like yours provide incontrovertible visual proof of existence beyond death.
Well, we didn't know --
Yes... or no? Do you want the Deetzes out or in?
<u>Out</u>.
All right. Who are you?
We're...
We're...
You're the dead.
Just get some people out of our house.

Hey <u>you've</u> been on Saturn! I <u>hate</u> those sandworms! <u>Yecchhh</u>! I've lost a lot of buddies to sandworms. So a daughter? She got good legs? God I love a young leg.
Folks, be reasonable here. I'm at your service. You be the judge. I'm a harmless guy. Try me.
Home. <u>Home</u>. <u>Home</u>!
I don't like Charles Deetz particularly, but you could have <u>killed</u> him.
Hey, I've been in a frigging bottle for six hundred years. I was out. Every dog has his day. This is my town. I need a night to howl.
You lilly-livered bleeding hearts!
I'm so sorry we frightened you. What were you doing?
I'd nearly given up on you. I was about to leave. I do have other clients.
Are you Juno, our case worker?
Are you Juno, our case worker?
Yes. I evaluate individual cases and determine if help is needed, deserved, and available.
Yes. I evaluate individual cases and determine if help is needed, deserved, and available.
We need help. We deserve help.
We're very unhappy.
What do you expect? You're dead.
-- Like you used to be?
Yes.
No.
Pity. Murderers seem to have an easy time of it. Just look at Amityville. He was one of my boys. Didn't have to give that one any lessons. From day one... But I must be off ... I've got a planeload of football players crashed in the midwest... they need a lot of help, just with the basics.
If... we have trouble. What about the guy in the flyer? Betelge...
No. You don't want his help.
No, you don't! He does not work well with others.
What do you mean? What's he do?
What do you mean? What's he do?
He's a freelance bio-exorcist. Claims to get rid of the living. But he's a troublemaker. He's pushy. He's been sleazing around that cemetery for 500 years.
He's a freelance bio-exorcist. Claims to get rid of the living. But he's a troublemaker. He's pushy. He's been sleazing around that cemetery for 500 years.
Our cemetery?
Our cemetery?
Yeah. He still tries popping up all over the place. But he can't join the party unless you call on him. Get the Deetzes out by yourselves! I gotta go.
The whorehouse was my idea. I want Betelgeuse out of the picture! We've got some serious talking to do.
About what?
About what?
You people have really screwed up! I received word that you allowed yourselves to be <u>photographed</u>. And you let Betelgeuse out and didn't put him back, and you let Otho get ahold of the handbook.
What about Betelgeuse?
Forget him. He'll remain with his whores until someone calls him. You need to worry about people like <u>Otho</u>. There are a lot of phony trance mediums. They usually can't make the formulas work, but if Otho stumbles on the right words in that handbook... he could hurt you. As in -- <u>exorcism</u>.
If I had seen a ghost at your age, I would have been frightened out of my wits.
You're not gross. Why were you wearing a sheet?
You're not gross. Why were you wearing a sheet?
We're practicing.
Tell the truth.
I always tell the truth. Of course I can see you.
We can't. We haven't left the house since the funeral.
Funeral. God, you guys <u>really are</u> <u>dead</u>! What was it like? The funeral. Did you cry?
I don't wear that stuff to <u>bed</u>. Besides, there's <u>nothing</u> wrong with it. I'm getting out of here.
Wait... I don't think it would be a very good idea if you told your parents that we're up here.
I hate you! I can't trust anybody!
No, wait!
He said if I let him out he would take me over to the other side to find you.
No, Lydia, we're dead.
No, Lydia, we're dead.
I want to be dead too.
I want to be dead too.
No you don't! No... Lydia... Why?
No you don't! No... Lydia... Why?
Life is just... too awful.
So, <u>never</u> let Beetle Juice out. Never. Besides... We're thinking about letting everyone stay... You and your father and mother can stay too.
Step... mother.
How'd you do on the science test?
It was gross. They wanted me to dissect a frog. I told them no way. I said it was against my religion. I got a C.
Hi, Barb! I'm glad I caught you. I heard you were on vacation!
That's right, Jane. Complete vacation.

Barbara Maitland, sweetie, you just listen now. This house is too big. It really ought to be for a couple with a family.
Oh, honey... I didn't mean anything ... it's just too big for you two. I know these things.
'Bye, Jane, I'll see you in church in a couple weeks.
Mr. and Mrs. Maitland? I've come for the last time. Where are you? Barb...
They're dead.
Cookie, they are dead, dead, deadski.
Of course they're dead. They're ghosts.
Of course they're dead. They're ghosts.
No, I mean they've gone. Decamped. Split. Vanished.

I want to get in.
You do? Over here? On <u>my</u> side?
You do? Over here? On <u>my</u> side?
I think so.
I think so.
Well, yes, of course. It's great over here. You'll meet all the greats. James Dean. Buddy Holly. 'The little things a you say and do... make me want to be with you-a-hoo.'
Well, yes, of course. It's great over here. You'll meet all the greats. James Dean. Buddy Holly. 'The little things a you say and do... make me want to be with you-a-hoo.'
Well, it can't be any worse than my life here.

That's right. They treat you like scum I bet?

Yeah.
Yeah.
I can't help you from this side, but here's how we do it. So <u>simple</u>. Say my name three times. That's all. I'll be all yours. Then I'll bring you over here in style.

Minor problem. The rules. I can't tell it to you. But... do you know how to play charades?

Yes.
Yes.
Of course you do.
Three syllables.
No, dummy. Two.
No, dummy. Two.
Your fingers are so small I can't see them. First word -- two syllables.
I don't know what that signal means.
It means look <u>behind</u> you, bimbo.
Beetle!
Good girrrl!
Breakfast beetle? Beetle? Beetle fruit? Fruit bat? Fruit battle? Volkswagen? Fruit wagon?
Good thing you are beautiful, kid. You are <u>dumb</u>!
I am <u>not</u>! Beetle... Juice?
That's it!
That's it!
Your name is <u>Beetle Juice</u>? Yecch! That's as bad as <u>Deee</u>lia <u>Deee</u>tz.
Your name is <u>Beetle Juice</u>? Yecch! That's as bad as <u>Deee</u>lia <u>Deee</u>tz.
It's spelled different, but basically... Now you said it twice; just one more time, and I'll be free. And then <u>you'll</u> be free.
God, you're anatomically correct!
Just <u>say</u> it.

You were the snake! Right? I know. I saw you.

So... You're ready for me now?
You've got to help them.
You've got to help them.
Can you help <u>me</u>?
Can you help <u>me</u>?
... I will.
... I will.
Then <u>I'll</u> help them. For a price.
W... What is it?


Your qu...? But you're...
Your qu...? But you're...
I'm beeyoo-teeful.
Yes, of course you are. Well, Otho had an intuition. Call it a hunch -- that it was going to be a fabled monstrosity of a house. And it certainly is. Charles, you're lucky the Yuppies are buying condos, so you can afford what I'm going to have to do to this place. We are talking <u>from the ground</u> <u>ups'ville</u>!
That's fine, Otho. Just keep me out of it. I am here to relax and clip coupons. And goddamnit, I mean to do it.
Otho, you've got to help me get Maxie Dean up here. I have a deal that could make all of us very comfortable.
He's a cloven-hooved beast!
He's a cloven-hooved beast!
He's your cousin.
He's your cousin.
I am ashamed to say he is. Look, nothing short of giving away free sacks of money would get him up here, Charles. And Sarah? Forget it. You can't get her out of Bergdorf's with plastic explosives.
Otho?
It's too late, Charles. I'm sorry.
It's <u>Otho</u>!
Otho, why didn't you just come in the door?
I can't believe that we're eating Cantonese. Is there no Szechuan up here? Hunan?
There's only one Chinese restaurant in town, darling, the owners are Irish and Irish people happen to cook Cantonese. They don't know better.
Lydia, at your age, you are <u>so</u> <u>young</u>. Charles, we need to call that awful Jane Butterfield tomorrow and get the key to the attic door. Can't you find a way to hold back some of her commission?
We're going to have a lot to do tomorrow... The Goodwill truck is coming, and whatever is up there in that attic goes away with it. Should have it fumigated too. I saw a fly today.
I feel like we've been at war, Charles.
At least insofar as we have our first casualty. Me.
At least insofar as we have our first casualty. Me.
Otho'll know what to do.

What's he going to do? Viciously rearrange their environment?

Otho knows as much about the supernatural as he knows about interior decoration.

Let's hope he knows how to produce those damn ghosts for Max and Sarah... Because I've bought options on property all over town. I need Max's financing...

Just don't tell Lydia.
Just don't tell Lydia.
Why not?
Why not?
I think she's in with them.
They're probably guilty about what they did to me.
Not these people! They are ruthless!
What do you think, honey?
Delia hates it.
Lydia, relax. We'll build you a darkroom in the basement.
My whole life is a darkroom! One ... big... dark... room.
Yeah, maybe if he's nice, he'll let me hang myself from a rope in his barn.
Lydia, we're the first trickle! In a couple of years this whole town will be <u>filled</u> with people like us.
Where is your mother?
Stepmother. She's out torturing the movers.
Stepmother. She's out torturing the movers.
Lydia. Try to be civil. I'm going to see if I can set up a noise-free zone in the study.
I was just trying to open the door. Mrs. Butterfield brought over a skeleton key.
Let me have it.
Skeleton keys never work. Anyway, this can wait. We'll get a crowbar later. Your mother...
Stepmother.
Stepmother.
... asked you for something, didn't she? I'm going down to relax. I want a noise-free zone. Do you understand? Noise free.
What?
I'm lonely.
Darling, can't you see I'm relaxing in here!
Well I just wanted to tell you what I saw.
Well I just wanted to tell you what I saw.
Lydia. What the hell is the point of my moving up here if you people won't let me relax? Go help your mother.
Dad. Do you believe me?
Yes. Except when you creep around in your mother's --
Yes. Except when you creep around in your mother's --
Stepmother's...
Stepmother's...
... sheets.
... sheets.
Well this is... I mean, this is the weirdest --
Well this is... I mean, this is the weirdest --
Lydia, I don't know what it is with you and these pratical jokes, but --
Lydia, I don't know what it is with you and these pratical jokes, but --
<u>This is not a joke</u>! That sheet was full of ghosts.
The attic room is locked --
They're ghosts. They do what they want.
Answer your mother.
Listen, you guys. These ghosts are really nice people. I think we scared them off. Let's just leave them alone. Okay?
Look at all that <u>parking</u>!
Come on. Leave their stuff alone.
Now, let's get back to business. I want to get Maxie Dean and Sarah up here immediately. I can make history here! I'm going to turn this sleepy little backward town into a leading supernatural research center... and amusement park.
I cannot believe this.
I cannot believe this.
Delia will cook...
I'll bring the wine... and the business plan. And Lydia you'll bring the ghosts.
I can't <u>bring</u> the ghosts. They're not here!
I can't <u>bring</u> the ghosts. They're not here!
Otho, could you actually... do something with them?
They're... not here anymore.
Nonsense, everytime she says that, the paint peels, and some wild creature tries to kill us.
Not <u>a building</u>! That's the beauty of it. I think I can buy the <u>whole town</u>. These people don't know the value of their property!
Then we own a whole <u>town</u> full of nowhere.
Then we own a whole <u>town</u> full of nowhere.
No, no, c'mon, Max, you know me. I've got plans. You gotta come up here and see, then I'll tell you about it.
Just a minute, Maxie. Somebody...
No listen... we'll talk about this visiting later, I gotta go, I gotta meeting on the Japanese joint venture.
No listen... we'll talk about this visiting later, I gotta go, I gotta meeting on the Japanese joint venture.
Great idea, Maxie! Those Japanese could <u>run</u> it for us. Build them a dormitory in the woods. Listen, think right about it, will you? We've almost got the house ready, you bring Sarah with you and I'll show you.
Great idea, Maxie! Those Japanese could <u>run</u> it for us. Build them a dormitory in the woods. Listen, think right about it, will you? We've almost got the house ready, you bring Sarah with you and I'll show you.
Yeah yeah, we'll think on it. 'Bye ya, Charles. You relax up there, ya hear?
I don't care from guilt. I just want to <u>see</u> them.
Otho, can you do it?
Are they suffering?
They're already dead. They can't feel a thing.
I plan to have a stroke from the amount of MSG that's in this food.
This is our first meal in this house, Lydia. Why don't we all do our little private parts to make it a pleasant one?
We'll be <u>the</u> art center of summer New York. I'll teach those phony gallery creeps to refuse my sculpture. And when Otho and I get through with this house, you people are not going to recognize it.
I say let's keep it the way it is.
<u>You jerks</u>! That is my art, and it is <u>dangerous</u>! You think I want to die like that? Lydia. Moving is a family affair. So buckle down now and go get Mommy some drugs.
Any particular kind?
Any particular kind?
Joke! Joke! Aspirin! It doesn't matter what brand.
I can't believe you are doing this to me! <u>Ghosts</u>. I am giving a dinner party for seven people tonight. Otho has agreed to come back for the demolition of the attic. My agent, Bernard, is bringing some woman who writes for <u>Architectural Digest</u>. In fact, no one here tonight has not been in <u>Vanity Fair</u>. Except you.
I <u>told</u> them you were too mean to be afraid.
I <u>told</u> them you were too mean to be afraid.
Don't you <u>dare</u> talk to others about me. I'm an <u>artist</u>! The only thing that scares me is being embarrassed in front of my friends. Do you know how hard it is to get civilized people to set foot in this part of Connecticut? Not a solitary word of this pubescent tripe to anyone.
Don't you <u>dare</u>.
I saw some ghosts.
Lydia tried to play a most amusing joke on me this afternoon.
It wasn't a joke.
It wasn't a joke.
Tried to convince me that this house is haunted. Kids. Kids. Kids! I love them.
I think the reason is they were trying to scare you, and you didn't get scared --
Of <u>course</u> we weren't scared. Just a little startled. One of those sushi dropped down my Kamali.
All right, you dead people! Come on out, or we'll break down this door and drag you out on the ropes you hanged yourself with!
Shhhh. They didn't commit suicide.
Shhhh. They didn't commit suicide.
It doesn't matter. What matters is I've got a roomful of guests down there, who think I'm a fraud. I am going to teach you something here Lydia. You've <u>got</u> to take the right tone in things like this, or people -- whether they're dead or alive -- people will walk all <u>over</u> you. Come on out, or I will make death so miserable
Lydia, I will never forgive you for embarrassing me in front of my social inferiors. You help us with these ghosts or you'll be sorry.
I'm sorry already.
That was the single most unattractive window treatment I have ever seen in the entire of my existence.
I'm <u>so</u> glad you could leave the city to consult me, Otho.
Is the rest of the house as bad as this?
The rest of the house is probably worse. When can you and I get started?
The rest of the house is probably worse. When can you and I get started?
No time like the present, as my wicked stepmother used to say.
What's wrong?
I thought I saw something.
Okay?
You read my <u>mind</u>! I love clients who can read my mind. I don't think people realize how strong a connection there is between interior decoration and the supernatural.

<u>I know</u>... I read your book, <u>The</u> <u>Haunted Tapestries of the Waldorf</u>.
<u>I know</u>... I read your book, <u>The</u> <u>Haunted Tapestries of the Waldorf</u>.
Gooood!
What do you think?
Viridian?
Viridian?
Viridian? What is...?
Blue-green! Hydrated chromic oxide! Remember I'm schooled in chemistry. I was a hair analyst! Briefly. Interior design is a <u>science</u>, Delia! Think of me as Doctor Otho. And this patient is truly <u>sick</u>!
Of course, her favorite color! How <u>beautiful</u>!
<u>Oh my God</u>!
<u>I know</u>! We just have to <u>pray</u> that the other closets are bigger than this one.
Otho, I can<u>not</u> <u>live</u> with these cheap domestic floor tiles.
Be brave! Otho take care! Onward!
Is there much more of this torture?
That's Charles' study. But you don't have to even look in there. He'll love whatever you do to it. He's such a sheep.
That's Charles' study. But you don't have to even look in there. He'll love whatever you do to it. He's such a sheep.
Oh, as long as we're here...
'I' will tell you what is boring. Once you cover up the wallpaper, knock down a few walls, alter the traffic patterns, and -- perhaps -- only perhaps -- think about an inground pool -- the place <u>might</u> just be livable. What's on the third floor?
Attic space.
Attic space.
Let's see. We could turn that into a media room.
You don't have a key?
Maybe Charles does.
Maybe Charles does.
I have a feeling there's some very interesting space behind this door.
I have a feeling there's some very interesting space behind this door.
Probably the world's largest <u>Reader's</u> <u>Digest</u> collection! C'mon, let's have some chablis, Otho, I'm laid bare by this experience. Entirely bare.
Now, Lydia... Favor us about your ghosts.
<u>No</u>! Do not encourage this little... person.
<u>No</u>! Do not encourage this little... person.
Oh, Delia, lighten up!
Oh, Delia, lighten up!
She's been without therapy up here and I will not allow her to ruin...
It does indicate a marvelously urbane sense of humor on the part of these ghosts -- that they actually appear in <u>sheets</u>!
We're dealing with Tracy and Hepburn here, a very sophisticated pair. We must protect them, treat them with respect, <u>nur</u>ture them.
Look at that <u>detail</u>!
Look at the tiny figures.
Are they still here, Otho?
Oh, they're still here. They're Just not showing up.
What's happening to them?
I don't know.
Well there's a Little Deetz at least. Boy, when you city people do something, you do it right, don't you?
What happened to the people who used to live here?
Is this the key to the attic?
That's a skeleton key. It'll open any door in that house. Will you give it to your father? And you might mention that I single-handedly decorated the house. In case he needs advice in that area. Come see me.
Are we going to be seeing you at Miss Shannon's Boarding School?
Yes, but I'm going to live at home.
Yes, but I'm going to live at home.
Remind me to talk to your mother about the dress code. I'm sure you're going to be very happy there.
Hellooo! How's school?
It's okay. How's the dirt business?
It's okay. How's the dirt business?
Well, I just placed a call to your mother. She had stepped out but I have some news for her.
It's bad luck. And I believe hugely in luck.
Hold your breath and we'll pull.
Otho, that's terrible.
My sentiments exactly. Porcelain is for teeth!
They don't want to come down.
Why not?
All presences have a home space. A place where they live, so to speak. Where do they hide out?
The attic.
Perhaps if I were properly motivated.
That's slavery and murder. You don't know these people. They're just like you and me. They're nice people!
Wait a minute! What am I worried about? Otho, you can't even change a tire!
I'll need something personal of theirs.
Their wedding clothes.
Their wedding clothes.
<u>Adam</u>! <u>Adam</u>!
As flies the lizard Serpent fell; As goblin vizard, At the spell Of pale wizard, Sinks to hell; The buried, dead, and slain... Rise again.
The injection will ease the pain and swelling, Mr. Gardiner.
I understand. I've seen it done before.
I understand. I've seen it done before.
Now, you'll barely feel this. It won't hurt at all.
You were wrong, it did hurt.
But not for long...
It's good that there was no apparent damage to the bone.
Yes. I think so, too.
Yes. I think so, too.
However, with injuries such as this, I have run into minor hemorrhaging, which really isn't too serious at the time, but can cause secondary problems if not looked after.

You can pull your trousers up, now.
Oh, fine.

Just to take the proper precautions, Mr. Gardiner, I'd recommend we take you downstairs and X-ray your leg. ... By the way, Mr. Gardiner, I would like to ask you something straight out.

Thank you.
Thank you.
Good, keep your weight off that leg, Mr. Gardiner. In fact, it would be best if you could stay here for a day or two, if that would be would be possible. Since Benjamin became ill we have our own hospital downstairs. I can promise you the finest in care, unless, of course, you would prefer to go elsewhere.

Fine. Would you like me to speak to your personal physician?
Fine. Would you like me to speak to your personal physician?
No.
I'll send Wilson up to take you for X-rays, Mr. Gardiner. Feel free to use the telephone, and please let me know if you have any discomfort.
Yes, I will.
... And please call me Robert.
Yes, Robert. I will.
Chauncey, there you are. What are you doing on that leg?
It's fine today, Robert.
It's fine today, Robert.
Shame on you, Chauncey - you should let me be the judge of that. Please, sit in the chair.
I swear, Chauncey, between you and Benjamin, I've got my hands full... ... Say, that is coming along, the swelling has gone down considerably... ... Any pain here?
Yes, Robert. But it's not bad.
... Benjamin has been hounding me to allow him to address the annual meeting of his Financial Institute today, but obviously, the strain would be impossible... How about here, Chauncey, any soreness?
Hardly any, Robert.
... Were you going somewhere?
No, Robert.
No, Robert.
... Oh. ... My God, I only wish that Benjamin had your recuperative powers... Anyway, the President offered to sit in for Ben at the meeting, quite a nice gesture, I felt. He's due here soon, I believe.

He does, does he?

Yes, Ben told me to be in his room at ten o'clock.

Why, that's terrific, Chauncey.
Why, that's terrific, Chauncey.
How do I know when it's ten o'clock?
... It's five of, you'd best get on in there.
Thank you, Robert.
I would like to walk today.
Hell yes - walk. You're meeting the President, aren't you?
Hell yes - walk. You're meeting the President, aren't you?
Oh, really?
... He's gone, Chauncey.
Yes, Robert. I have seen it before. It happens to old people.
Yes, Robert. I have seen it before. It happens to old people.
Yes, I suppose that's true.
Will you be leaving now, Robert?
In a day or two, yes.

Eve is going to stay. The house will not be closed.

... You've become quite a close friend of Eve's - haven't you Mr... ... Chance...?
... You've become quite a close friend of Eve's - haven't you Mr... ... Chance...?
Yes. I love Eve very much.
Yes. I love Eve very much.
I see... ... And you are really a gardener, aren't you?
I see... ... And you are really a gardener, aren't you?
Yes, Robert - I am. I'll go tell Eve about Ben now, Robert.
I know exactly what you mean. Today the businessman is at the mercy of kid-lawyers from the SEC. All they want to do is regulate our natural growth! It's happening across the country!
To everyone, I'm afraid. The Government controls are so restricting that the Medical Profession, as we know it, is being legislated out of existence.
To everyone, I'm afraid. The Government controls are so restricting that the Medical Profession, as we know it, is being legislated out of existence.
Of course! By kid-lawyers!
... No, of course you don't. Excuse me for being so presumptuous. No man knows everything about another man - however, very few are honest enough to admit it.
That is so true. You're different, Chauncey... Quite different than most men.
Some pain is to be expected... ... And I think what would be best for the two of you is a good night's rest. ... It's late, I'm afraid it's time for my patients to prepare for bed.
We have common foes, Chauncey - kid lawyers and our physician!
And you, Benjamin, must be strong and brave for me. Turn over, please.
In a minute, Robert - in a minute... Chauncey, I would like to ask a favor of you...
No more, Robert... No more needles...
It's not good, Ben - I'm sure you can feel it.
It's not good, Ben - I'm sure you can feel it.
I know, Robert... But, strangely enough, I don't feel too bad about now... I feel all right... I guess it's easier... knowing Chauncey is here... to take care of things...
Good God, Eve - you'll freeze out here.
I wanted some fresh air, Robert. How is Mr. Gardiner?
I wanted some fresh air, Robert. How is Mr. Gardiner?
A rather large contusion, but I don't feel there is any serious damage. I'd like to keep an eye on him, though - I suggested that he stay here for a couple of days.

Stay here? Is that necessary?
Stay here? Is that necessary?
Not necessary, but preferable. I don't think he'll be a bother, he seems like a most refreshing sort of man.

Yes, he is different... Not the kind of person one usually meets in Washington.

How true. Mr. Gardiner may be a welcome change of pace.

He's very intense, and internal, don't you think?
He's very intense, and internal, don't you think?
At times, yes. But that's not an uncommon reaction to such an accident. Actually, I found him to have quite a sense of humor.

Good. It might be pleasant for a couple of days. ... Robert... Is there any improvement...?
Good. It might be pleasant for a couple of days. ... Robert... Is there any improvement...?
No, Eve... I'm sorry.
... Eve - this has been an exhausting day for Ben...
... But he's...?
... But he's...?
He's resting comfortably now. There's no cause for alarm, yet...
... He walked off...
Chauncey is so sensitive... He was overcome with grief...
... Do you think we should look for him?
I don't think so, he should be along soon...
I don't think so, he should be along soon...
I wish he were here...
We have to find him, Robert - he could be lost, something may have happened, we can't leave him!
You really care for him, don't you, Eve?
You really care for him, don't you, Eve?
I do - we do - both of us, Ben and I feel so much for Chauncey...
I do - we do - both of us, Ben and I feel so much for Chauncey...
I think we'd better go look for him. David!
... And he told us that he had been living there since he was a child, working as a gardener. He showed us a room in the garage, where he said he stayed, and I... Well, I didn't really believe him, of course - but why the act?
I have no idea...
I have no idea...
Another thing that baffles me, Doctor - what was his connection with the deceased? Major financial dealings, obviously - but our firm has no record of any such transactions.

Hmmm. You say he showed you his garden?

Well, he said it was his, he walked us through it.

I see. Mr. Franklin, I must ask you and Miss Hayes to keep this incident with Mr. Gardiner to yourselves. There's no telling what he was involved in, and the matter may be extremely confidential. So please, not a word.

Fine. Thank you, Mr. Franklin.
Fine. Thank you, Mr. Franklin.
Certainly, glad to be of help.
Gentlemen, I didn't call you here at such an hour to make accusations, I just want to explore the possibilities. Now, I have three questions; Is the man a foreign agent? Or, have we suddenly found that our methods of gathering data are grossly inefficient? Or, thirdly, have the man's files been destroyed? Now, I'd like some answers.
Gardiner is not a foreign agent, there are now sixteen countries investigating the man. We can rule that out.
Gardiner is not a foreign agent, there are now sixteen countries investigating the man. We can rule that out.
Very well... Can we rule out inefficiency...?
I don't think that's entirely true, Grover.
And what do the boys around Intelligence think?

Well, Mr. President... They don't quite know what to think.
Well, Mr. President... They don't quite know what to think.
Gentlemen, needless to say, there is going to be a full Congressional investigation of your respective operations. Good night.
Do you know Raphael?
No sir, I don't believe I do.
No sir, I don't believe I do.
Oh. I have a message for him.
Oh. I have a message for him.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
A Black man gave me the message.

Well, I still don't believe I know the man, Mr. Gardiner. Now, hold still.
I understand. I've never seen anything like this on television.
Please, hold still, Mr. Gardiner.
Mr. Gardiner, I have a telephone call for you. Sidney Courtney, the financial editor of the Washington Post.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Would you care to take it, sir?

Yes.
Oh, Mr. Gardiner, I've been looking all over.

Fine. They felt that since you had such close ties with the President, you would be a splendid choice. ... Can I help you? Are you looking for something?
No. I like this attic very much.
... Won't you let us do something for you? Your leg should be examined, we could take you to a hospital.
There's no need for a hospital.
There's no need for a hospital.
Why, there certainly is. You must see a doctor, I insist on it. Please, let us take you.
I hope you're comfortable.
Yes. I am.
Yes. I am.
These can be such trying situations everyone seems to make such a to-do over a simple little accident. Of course, they can be very frightening, and I must apologize for David, he's never had an accident before.

I agree.
I agree.
Fine, it will save a lot of unnecessary fuss and it will be so much more pleasant for you... David, we'll just go on home. Jeffrey, would you call and let them know?
Would you care for a drink?
Yes. Thank you.
I would like to watch television.
Oh? Certainly...
Oh, by the way - I'm Eve Rand.
Hello, Eve.
May I ask your name?
My name is Chance.
My name is Chance.
Pardon me, was that Mr. Chance?

No, Eve. I'm not related to Basil and Perdita.
No, Eve. I'm not related to Basil and Perdita.
Oh. Well, they're just a wonderful couple, we've been friends for years. We visit their island quite often.
Did you lose something?
Yes. I lost my remote control.
Yes. I lost my remote control.
Oh... Well, I'm very sorry...
... I'll feel so relieved after Dr. Allenby examines your leg. After that, David can run you on home, or to your office or wherever you'd prefer... ... Is there anything special you would like to watch?
I like to watch. This is fine.
I can see that it must be very important for you to stay informed of all the latest events.
Yes.
Yes.
I admire that in a person. As for myself, I find there is so much to assimilate that it can become quite muddling at times...
Won't your injury prevent you from attending to business, Mr. Gardiner?
No. It won't do that.
No. It won't do that.
... Would you like us to notify anyone for you?
... Would you like us to notify anyone for you?
No. The Old Man died and Louise left.
I hope that staying here won't be an inconvenience for you.
No. I like it here.
Oh, I know exactly what you mean. I sometimes enjoy puttering around myself, such a pleasant way to forget one's troubles.
I am a very good gardener.
Chauncey, I wanted to tell you how dreadful I feel about the accident today, but that I'm delighted that you are staying with us.
Thank you, Eve - I like this house very much.

Was he a relative? Or an intimate friend?

Forgive me, Chauncey - I didn't mean to pry. You must have been very close to him.
Yes. I was.
Yes. I was.
I'm sorry... ... And what about Louise? YOU mentioned that she had gone, were you close to her also?
I'm sorry... ... And what about Louise? YOU mentioned that she had gone, were you close to her also?

Chauncey! Have you seen the papers?
No, Eve. I don't read the papers.
No, Eve. I don't read the papers.
Well, it seems you've been described as one of the architects of the President's speech. And your own comments from the 'This Evening' show are quoted side by side with the President's.

Yes, Eve. I know that.
... I'm grateful to you, Chauncey... I would have opened to you with a touch, and you know that... ... But you're so strong - I can trust myself with you. I'm glad, Chauncey - I'm glad that you showed so much restraint...
Yes, Eve. I'm very glad that you didn't open.
Yes, Eve. I'm very glad that you didn't open.
I know you are, Chauncey... ... You conquer a woman from within herself, you infuse in her the need and desire and the longing for your love.

I've never seen anyone handle the media as well as you, Chauncey. You're so cool and detached - almost as if you were born to it.
Thank you, Eve.
Yes.
Chauncey, this is Mr. Dennis Watson of the State Department.

It must be the punch, and it is stuffy in here -- I feel it a little myself. You're an angel, my dear - thank God there are still men like you around to give aid and comfort.

Yes. It's very good, Eve.
Yes. It's very good, Eve.
... But I've never done... ... You mean...? When... When... When I do it? ... When I touch myself...?
Dearest, you uncoil my wants; desire flows within me, and when you watch me my passion dissolves it. You set me free. I reveal myself to myself and I am drenched and purged.
That's very interesting, Eve.
Chauncey! Chauncey!
Hello, Eve.
Oh, Chauncey, darling... Where have you been? We thought we'd lost you - we've been looking all over!
Yes. I've been looking for you, too, Eve.

No. I'm not busy.

Then, I'll be brief. I covered the President's speech at the Financial Institute today, and since the Post would like to be as exact as possible, we would appreciate your comments on the meeting that took place between Mr. Rand, the President and yourself.

Yes, that is correct. I think you should ask Mr. Rand that.
I see. Then one more quick question, Mr. Gardiner; since we at the Post would like to, uh - update our profile on you - what exactly is your business?
I have nothing more to say.
Mr. Gardiner, I'm Morton Hull, the producer of 'This Evening.'
Hello, Morton.
Of course, Mr. Gardiner, the fact that you occupy such a position in the world of finance makes you ideally suited to provide our millions of viewers with an explanation of this nation's economic crisis.
I see.
I see.
Do you realize, Mr. Gardiner, that more people will be watching you tonight than all those who have seen theater plays in the last forty years?

Do you need a doctor? I could call Robert...
I don't want Robert.

I see.
I see.
Your foot! Give me your foot!!
You must sit with us, my friend, we have much to discuss.
I agree.
I agree.
How is my dear friend Benjamin feeling?
Regretfully, Mrs. Rand - I shall yield the pleasure of your company to others.
Yes, Eve. I shall yield too.
I'm sorry we haven't met sooner, Mr. Gardiner. I had the pleasure of seeing you on television last night and I listened with great interest to your down-to-earth philosophy. I'm not surprised that it was so quickly endorsed by the President. ... Tell me, Mr. Gardiner, just how serious is Benjamin's illness? I did not want to upset Mrs. Rand by discussing it in
Ben is very ill.
Ben is very ill.
Yes, so I've heard, a shame... As you know, we in the Soviet Union have the keenest interest in developments of the First American Financial Corporation... We are pleased to hear that you may fill Benjamin's place should he fail to recover. Be seated, please, Mr. Gardiner.
... Mr. Gardiner, I wish to be quite candid - considering the gravity of your economic situation, shouldn't we, the diplomats, and you, the businessman - get together more often?
Yes, I agree, I think so too.
Yes, I agree, I think so too.
To exchange our thoughts - what does a Russian know about business? On the other hand, what does an American know about diplomacy?
To exchange our thoughts - what does a Russian know about business? On the other hand, what does an American know about diplomacy?
Yes, I understand.
Yes, I understand.
And I have noticed in you a certain reticence regarding political issues - so why not a coming together? An interchange of opinion? We may find, my friend, that we are not so far from each other, not so far!
And I have noticed in you a certain reticence regarding political issues - so why not a coming together? An interchange of opinion? We may find, my friend, that we are not so far from each other, not so far!
We are not far... ... our chairs almost touch.
We are not far... ... our chairs almost touch.
Bravo! Bravo! Our chairs are indeed almost touching! And we want to remain seated on them, correct? We don't want them snatched from under us, am I right? Because if one goes, the other goes, and then - boom! Boom! And we are both down before our time, you see? And neither of us wants that, do you agree?

Yes. Tell me, Mr. Gardiner - do you by any chance enjoy Krylov's fables? I ask this because there is something... there is something Krylovian about you.
Yes. Tell me, Mr. Gardiner - do you by any chance enjoy Krylov's fables? I ask this because there is something... there is something Krylovian about you.
Do you think so? Do you think so?
Do you think so? Do you think so?
So you know Krylov!
So you know your Krylov in Russian, do you? Mr. Gardiner, I must confess I had suspected as much all along - I know an educated man when I meet one!
Oh, good.
Oh, good.
Yes, it is very good!
Yes, it is very good!
Yes, it is. Would you tell me your name again, please?
Yes, it is. Would you tell me your name again, please?
Ho! Ho! A dash of American humor! Vladimar Skrapinov!
Ho! Ho! A dash of American humor! Vladimar Skrapinov!
Yes. I like that name very much.
Yes. I like that name very much.
And yours, sir - Chauncey Gardiner! How poetic! Chauncey, a name of uncertain meaning! And Gardiner, a bit of the French, a suggestion of a stroll through the flowers! A beautiful name, my friend!
Yes, Eve. That would be good.
We must speak again, Mr. Gardiner, many times!
We must speak again, Mr. Gardiner, many times!
Thank you.
Welcome to Rand Memorial Hospital, Mr. Gardiner.
... I see.
I feel very good in here.
Sure you do. This ward is air tight, I have a little extra oxygen pumped in, keeps my spirits up.
Sure you do. This ward is air tight, I have a little extra oxygen pumped in, keeps my spirits up.
Yes. I like that very much.
Failure of the bone marrow to produce red blood cells... Not a damn thing they can do about it. Oh, they can make me comfortable, prolong my life with steroid therapy and transfusions... And what makes my blood boil, what little I have left, that is, Mr. Gardiner - is that it's generally a young person's disease... Here I am, getting on in years
Yes. You look very sick.
... We're prisoners, Mr. Gardiner - we're prisoners of tubes and technology.
I agree.
I agree.
... You will join us for dinner, won't you, Mr. Gardiner?

No, thank you. My house has been closed.
Oh. When you say 'Your house has been closed', you mean to say that your business was shut down?
Oh. When you say 'Your house has been closed', you mean to say that your business was shut down?
Yes. Shut down and locked by the attorneys.
Yes. Shut down and locked by the attorneys.
What'd I tell you? Kid-lawyers! The S.E.C.! Damn them!
That's good, Mr. Gardiner. Or may I call you Chauncey?
Yes. Chauncey is fine.
Yes. Chauncey is fine.
And I'm Ben.
Do we have a garden? Hah! Tomorrow, Chauncey, you will see our gardens.
I see. I would like to work in your garden.
A gardener! Well put, Chauncey excellent! Isn't that what a businessman is? A gardener? A person that makes flinty soil productive with the labor of his own hands, who waters it with the sweat from his own brow, and who creates a place of value for his family and community? Yes, Chauncey, what a brilliant metaphor -- yes, indeed, a productive businessman is a
Thank you, Ben. The garden that I left was such a place. Everything which grew there was with the labor of my own hands. I planted seeds and watered them and watched everything grow.

Bravo!
Bravo!
But I don't have that any more... ... All that's left for me now is the room upstairs.
But I don't have that any more... ... All that's left for me now is the room upstairs.
Now, wait a minute, Chauncey you are young, you are healthy, for God's sake don't give up on yourself! You have to fight! You can't let those bastards keep you down! I don't want to hear any more from you about the 'Room Upstairs'. That's where I'm going soon.
It's a very pleasant room, Ben.
Yes, I'm sure it is. That's what they say, anyway.
No, Ben.
Reluctant to speak, eh, Chauncey? Well, I can understand that. When a man loses everything, anger has a tendency to block out reason for a time. Just give it some thought, work with the idea, I'm sure you'll have plenty to say in a few days.

I could give it some thought, Ben, but my leg is very sore.
I could give it some thought, Ben, but my leg is very sore.
... Oh? Robert, take a look, would you?
Chauncey, up and around this morning, are you?
Yes, Ben. My leg is not very sore.
Yes, Ben. My leg is not very sore.
Well, that's good news, my boy.
Well, that's good news, my boy.
You're looking much better today, Ben.
You're looking much better today, Ben.
Hah! It's all make-up, Chauncey... I asked nurse Teresa to fix me up, I didn't want the President to think I was going to die during our talk.

I understand.
I understand.
No one likes a dying man, my boy - because few know what death is. All we know is the terror of it. But you're an exception, Chauncey - that's what I admire in you, your marvelous balance. You don't stagger back and forth between fear and hope - you're a truly peaceful man.

Thank you, Ben. ... The nurse did a very good job, Ben.
Yes, when I was younger I had thoughts about public office... But I found, Chauncey - that I was able to contribute more as a private citizen... of course, my wealth provided me with considerable influence, but I've tried, believe me, not to misuse that power... It's extremely important, Chauncey, when one is in a position of eminence, that he does not allow himself
I see, Ben.
I see, Ben.
... Maybe one day you shall find yourself in a similar position, Chauncey... Maybe one day...
I think what my most insightful friend is saying, Mr. President, is that we welcome the inevitable seasons of nature, yet we are upset by the seasons of our economy.
Yes. That is correct.
He's a decent fellow, the President, isn't he?
Yes, Ben - he is.
Yes, Ben - he is.
He was quite impressed with your comments, Chauncey - he hears my sort of analysis from everyone, but yours, unfortunately - seldom if ever at all.

I'm glad he came, Ben. It was nice talking to the President.
... You know, Chauncey, there's something about you... You're direct, you grasp things quickly and you state them plainly. You don't play games with words to protect yourself. I feel I can speak to you frankly... You know what I was talking to you about last night?
No, Ben.
No, Ben.
Oh, sure you do, the financial assistance program. I think you might be just the man to take charge of such an undertaking. I'd like you to meet with the members of the Board, we'll be able to discuss the matter at greater length at that time.

And, please, Chauncey - don't rush your decision. I know you're not a man to act on the spur of the moment.
And, please, Chauncey - don't rush your decision. I know you're not a man to act on the spur of the moment.
Thank you, Ben.
Thank you, Ben.
And now, Chauncey, I'm afraid you must excuse me - I'm very tired all of a sudden.
Certainly, Ben.
Senator Rowley's widow, Sophie, is hosting an evening reception tomorrow evening honoring Ambassador Skrapinov of the Soviet Union... I think it's rather obvious that Robert won't allow me to attend, so - would you go in my place, and escort Eve?

Yes. I would like to escort Eve.
Yes. I would like to escort Eve.
Good. Together, the two of you should create quite a stir - I can already hear the gossip.
... Chauncey... Chauncey...
Yes, Ben - are you going to die now?
... I'm about to surrender the Horn of Plenty for the Horn of Gabriel, my boy...
Oh, I see.
Oh, I see.
Let me feel the strength in your hand, Chauncey... Let me feel your strength... Yes, that's good... I hope, Chauncey - I hope that you'll stay with Eve... Take care of her, watch over her, she's a delicate flower, Chauncey...

She cares for you and she needs your help, Chauncey... there's much to be looked after...
Yes. I would like to do that.
Yes. I would like to do that.
... I've worked very hard and enjoyed my life... I've known success... and I've felt love... My associates, Chauncey - I've talked with them about you... They're eager to meet you... very eager to meet you... I'm very fond of you, Chauncey... And I understand Eve... Tell her that... tell her I'm madly in love with her...
We could do it now, we can go upstairs. ... Please, it's time for us. Come upstairs.
I like to watch.
I like to watch.
Watch? You mean just watch me? Doing it alone?
Watch? You mean just watch me? Doing it alone?
Yes. I like to watch very much.
Yes. I like to watch very much.
Well, if that's what you want, then I want it too. We can go this way.

I want to tell Eve.

Tell Eve? You mean Mrs. Rand?

Yes.
Yes.
Oh, you can tell her later. She'll never miss you in this crowd.
Mr. Gardiner, I'm Ronald Stiegler, of Harvard Books.
Hello, Ronald.
Hello, Ronald.
Mr. Gardiner, my editors and I have been wondering if you'd consider writing a book for us? Something on your political philosophy. What do you say?

I can't write.
I can't write.
Of course, who can nowadays? I have trouble writing a post card to my children! Look, we could give you a six figure advance, provide you with the very best ghostwriter, research assistants, proof readers...

What sort of bed is it?
May I help you, Mr. Gardiner?
Yes. I would like to go to Rand Memorial Hospital.
Yes. I would like to go to Rand Memorial Hospital.
... Sir?
... Sir?
Yes.
... Did you wish to see someone, sir?
Yes, I would like to see Ben.
Yes, I would like to see Ben.
Oh, Mr. Rand, of course. Right this way, sir.
Mr. Chance, I'm very pleased to meet you.
Yes.
... Then you really are a gardener?
Yes.
Yes.
Your appearance doesn't suggest that at all, Mr. Chance.
Your appearance doesn't suggest that at all, Mr. Chance.
Oh. Thank you.
What about money?
I never needed money.
Some pictures...?
Yes. Of men and women.
Yes. Of men and women.
... Oh.
How about taxes, Mr. Chance, surely you must have paid taxes?
No.
Might you have a birth certificate, Mr. Chance?
No. That's where Joe fixed the bricks.
I am allowed to go to the attic and select any of the Old Man's suits. They all fit me very well. I can also take his shirts, shoes and coats.
It is quite amazing how those clothes have come back into style.
It is quite amazing how those clothes have come back into style.
Yes. I have seen styles on television.
Good day, Mr. Chance.
Good day, Sally.
This is terrible, sir - I hope you're not badly injured...
No. I'm not badly injured. But my leg is very sore.
Can you walk? It's not broken, is it?
It's very sore.
I don't think we should call anyone just yet, it may not even be all that serious.
I agree.
I agree.
Let's have a look, do you mind?
Let's have a look, do you mind?
Of course. I would like to look.
It's starting to swell, is it painful?
Yes.
Please, sir.
I've never ridden in an automobile.

I assure you, sir, David is a very careful driver. Please, won't you let us take you?

... Yes. You can take me.
... Yes. You can take me.
Very good.
... My suitcase.
Yes sir. I'll take care of that.
Does it have a television?
No - but Mr. Rand does have one with an electric motor, that way he can get around by himself.
No - but Mr. Rand does have one with an electric motor, that way he can get around by himself.
I see.
How long do we stay in here?
How long? I don't know, see what the doctor says ...
... That is a very small room.
Yes sir, I guess that's true smallest room in the house.
Yes sir, I guess that's true smallest room in the house.
Yes. It seems to be.
... Hmmm... Elevator.
... Yes sir - elevator!
... Evening, Chance.
... Good evening, Louise.
... The Old Man is getting weaker, Chance.
I see.
I see.
I'm afraid he's slippin' a bit with every hour that goes by...
... Back up those stairs - damn... That Man's needin' me more and more just before he never needs me again...
Is his back feeling better?
Good morning, Louise.
He's dead, Chance! The Old Man's dead!
He's dead, Chance! The Old Man's dead!
... I see.
... I see.
Must of happened durin' the night, I don't know... Lord, he wasn't breathin' and as cold as a fish. I touched him, just to see, and you believe me, Chance - that's doin' more than I get paid to do... Then I just covered him up, pulled the sheet over his head...

Yes. I've seen that done.
Yes. I've seen that done.
Then I got the hell out of that room and called the doctor and I think I woke him probably, he wasn't any too alert. He just said, 'Yeah, he's been expectin' it and said he'd send somebody over...' Lord, what a mornin'!

... Yes, Louise, it's snowing in the garden today. Have you looked outside and seen the snow? It's very white.
Dammit, Boy! Is that all you got to say? More gobbledegook? That Old Man's layin' up there dead as hell and it just don't make any difference to you!
Yes, Louise. I have seen it often. It happens to old people.
Yes, Louise. I have seen it often. It happens to old people.
Well, ain't that the truth...
Well, ain't that the truth...
Yes. It is.
Oh, Lord, Chance - I don't know what I was expectin' from you... I'm sorry for yellin' like I did... No sir, I just don't know what I was expectin' ... ... I 'spose I'd better gather up some breakfast for you...
Yes, I'm very hungry.
Yes, I'm very hungry.
Well, no more stewin' those prunes every mornin', that's somethin', I guess... ... what are you goin' to do now, Chance?
Well, no more stewin' those prunes every mornin', that's somethin', I guess... ... what are you goin' to do now, Chance?
I'm going to work in the garden.
... Well, ain't you the gentleman this mornin'... ... gotta go now, Chance...
Yes.
Yes.
You're gonna need somebody, someone's gotta be around for you, boy... ... You oughta find yourself a lady, Chance... But I guess it oughta be an old lady, 'cause you ain't gonna do a young one any good, not with that little thing of yours... ... You're always gonna be a little boy, ain't you? ... Goodbye, Chance...
Mr. Gardiner, how very nice to have you with us this evening.
Yes.
Yes.
I'd like to thank you for filling in on such short notice for the Vice President.
I'd like to thank you for filling in on such short notice for the Vice President.
You're welcome.
You're welcome.
I always find it surprising, Mr. Gardiner, to find men like yourself, who are working so intimately with the President, yet manage to remain relatively unknown.

No. I don't object.
No. I don't object.
Fine, then let's get started. The current state of our country is of vital interest to us all, and I would like to know if you agree with the President's view of the economy?
Fine, then let's get started. The current state of our country is of vital interest to us all, and I would like to know if you agree with the President's view of the economy?
Which view?
Come now, Mr. Gardiner, before his speech at the Financial Institute the President consulted with you and Benjamin Rand, did he not?
Yes. I was there with Ben.
Yes. I was there with Ben.
I know that, Mr. Gardiner.
I know that, Mr. Gardiner.
Yes.
Yes.
Well, let me rephrase the question; the President compared the economy of this country to a garden, and stated that after a period of decline a time of growth would naturally follow. Do you go along with this belief?
Well, let me rephrase the question; the President compared the economy of this country to a garden, and stated that after a period of decline a time of growth would naturally follow. Do you go along with this belief?
Yes, I know the garden very well. I have worked in it all my life. It is a good garden and a healthy one; its trees are healthy and so are its shrubs and flowers, as long as they are trimmed and watered in the right seasons. The garden needs a lot of care. I do agree with the President; everything in it will
Don't we need a leader capable of guiding us through the seasons? The bad as well as the good?
Yes. We need a very good gardener.
Well, Mr. Gardiner, from the sound of our audience, I'd say that your words are a most welcome respite from what we've been hearing from others...
Thank you.
I'm sorry to say that our time is running short, but before we close, I'd like to ask one final question. What sort of gardener, sir, would you be?
I am a very serious gardener.
Hello, Thomas... I'm Chance, the gardener.
... The gardener? ... Yes, of course... Mr. Chance, this is Ms. Hayes.
... We're with Franklin, Jennings and Roberts, the law firm handling the estate.
Yes, Thomas - I understand.
... Are you waiting for someone? An appointment?
Yes. I'm waiting for my lunch.
Yes. I'm waiting for my lunch.
Your lunch? You have a luncheon appointment here?

Yes. Louise will bring me lunch.

... You've quite a sense of humor, Mr. Chance - but all kidding aside, may I ask just what you are doing here?
... You've quite a sense of humor, Mr. Chance - but all kidding aside, may I ask just what you are doing here?
I live here.

You live here? ... We don't have any record of that.

Ever since I can remember, since I was a child.
Ever since I can remember, since I was a child.
Since you were a child?
Since you were a child?
Yes, Thomas. I have always been here. I have always worked in the garden.
Do you have any proof of your employment, Mr. Chance - any checks from the deceased, any contracts or documents?
No.
No.
How were you compensated for these duties you say you performed?
How were you compensated for these duties you say you performed?
Compensated...?
Compensated...?
How were you paid?
How were you paid?
I was given meals, and a home...
Mr. Chance, perhaps you could show us some identification with your address -- a Driver's License, a credit card, checkbook?
No, I do not have any of those.
No, I do not have any of those.
Then how about medical records? Could you give us the name of your doctor, or your dentist?

I have no need for a doctor or dentist. I have never been ill. I have never been allowed outside of this house, and, except for Joe, I have never had any visitors.

... Joe? Who's Joe?
... Joe? Who's Joe?
Joe Saracini. He was a mason that did some repairs on the brickwork at the rear of the house. That was in 1952.

1952...?
1952...?
Yes. I remember when he came. He was very fat and had short hair and showed me some pictures from a funny little book.
Mr. Chance, that was twenty-seven years ago.
Yes and the Old Man used to come to my garden. He would read and rest there.

Come now, Mr. Jennings had been bedridden for thirty-five years, since he fractured his spine.

Yes, Thomas, that is correct. Then he stopped visiting my garden.

... We shall need some proof of your having resided here, Mr. Chance.
... We shall need some proof of your having resided here, Mr. Chance.
You have me, I am here. What more proof do you need?
Have you served in the Army?
No, Thomas. But I have seen the Army on television.
Those trees were very young when I first arrived.
Are you related to the deceased, Mr. Chance?
Are you related to the deceased, Mr. Chance?
No, I don't think so. And I have planted and shaped all the hedges, and in the springtime you will be able to see my flowers.
... Do you drive this, Mr. Chance?
No, Thomas. I have never been in an automobile.
The Old Man gave me nice television sets, this one has remote control. He has one just like it.
Mr. Chance, the fact remains that we have no information of your having any connection with the deceased.
Mr. Chance, the fact remains that we have no information of your having any connection with the deceased.
Yes, I understand.
What are your plans now, Mr. Chance?
I would like to stay and work in my garden.
Mr. Chance, assuming what you say is the truth, I would like to know what sort of claim you are planning to make against the deceased's estate.
I'm fine, Thomas. The garden is a healthy one. There is no need for a claim.
I'm fine, Thomas. The garden is a healthy one. There is no need for a claim.
Good. That's good. Then if you would please sign a paper to that effect.
No, Thomas. I don't know how to sign.
Come now, Mr. Chance.
Come now, Mr. Chance.
I have no claim, Thomas.
I have no claim, Thomas.
But you won't sign, correct?
But you won't sign, correct?
Correct.
Correct.
Very well, Mr. Chance - if you insist on dragging this matter on... But I must inform you this house will be closed tomorrow at noon. If indeed, you do reside here, you will have to move out.

Move out? I don't understand, Thomas.
Move out? I don't understand, Thomas.
I think you do, Mr. Chance. However, I will reiterate, this house is closed and you must leave... Call me if you change your mind about signing. C'mon, Sally - let's grab a bite...
Good morning, Mr. President.
... Hello.
You look much taller on television, Mr. President.
... Oh, really...
Well, Mr. Gardiner, that's just fine with me - I'm a man that appreciates a frank discussion... Be seated, please, Mr. Gardiner...
Yes, I will.
Yes, I will.
Now, Ben, did you happen to get a chance to...
Do you agree with Ben, Mr. Gardiner? Are we finished? Or do you think we can stimulate growth through temporary incentives?
As long as the roots are not severed, all is well and all will be well in the garden.
As long as the roots are not severed, all is well and all will be well in the garden.

That is correct. In a garden, growth has its season. There is spring and summer, but there is also fall and winter. And then spring and summer again...
That is correct. In a garden, growth has its season. There is spring and summer, but there is also fall and winter. And then spring and summer again...
... Spring and summer... Yes, I see... Fall and winter. Yes, indeed... Could you go through that one more time, please, Mr. Gardiner?
Yes. It has.
... You will honor me and my family with a visit, won't you?
... You will honor me and my family with a visit, won't you?
Yes. I will.
Yes. I will.
Wonderful, we'll all look forward to seeing you. Is Eve around? I'd like to say hello.
... Gardiner is laconic, matter-of fact. The scuttlebutt is that he's a strong candidate for one of the vacant seats on the board of First American. But before we can do any sort of a piece on the man, we're going to need facts on his background... ... Kinney, what did you come up with?
... Nothing.
... Nothing.
... Skip the levity, Kinney - what have you got?
... Skip the levity, Kinney - what have you got?
... I realize this sounds banal but there is no information of any sort on Gardiner. We have no material on him - zilch...
... Sid, be reasonable - I've been everywhere, there's no place left to check!
Try again.
Try again.
Sure, try again - where? There's nothing, it's like he never existed!
Sure, try again - where? There's nothing, it's like he never existed!

Sid, it's useless!
Sid, it's useless!
I said - try again.
Oh, Ben - I miss you so when I'm out... How are you feeling?
Tired... And I'm getting tired of being so tired. Other than that, I'm doing very well.
Tired... And I'm getting tired of being so tired. Other than that, I'm doing very well.
No headaches?

No, it's been a good day - better than yours, from what I've been told.
No, it's been a good day - better than yours, from what I've been told.
You heard?

I may be a shut-in, but I do not lack for news. I'm sorry you had to go through all that.
I may be a shut-in, but I do not lack for news. I'm sorry you had to go through all that.
Oh, it wasn't all that bad, darling. We were fortunate that Mr. Gardiner turned out to be so reasonable.
Oh, it wasn't all that bad, darling. We were fortunate that Mr. Gardiner turned out to be so reasonable.
Reasonable? Good, I'd like to meet a reasonable man. Why don't you ask this Gardiner to join us for dinner?
Reasonable? Good, I'd like to meet a reasonable man. Why don't you ask this Gardiner to join us for dinner?
Do you feel well enough for that?
Do you feel well enough for that?
Hah!... Tell me the truth, Eve - if I wait until I feel better, will I ever meet the man?
Oh. I'm very sorry. Well, if you have any need for any of our facilities, please do not hesitate to ask.
Do you need a secretary?
I'm becoming quite attached to Chauncey - quite attached... ... And so are you, aren't you, Eve.
... Yes, I am, Ben.
... Yes, I am, Ben.
That's good... That's good.
... Ben, really...
... Thank you, Chauncey... Thank you very much. ... All right, Robert, I'm all yours.
Good evening, Mrs. Rand.
Good evening, Wilson.
Good evening, Wilson.
I shall take the gentleman to the third floor guest suite, ma'am. Dr. Allenby is standing by.
I shall take the gentleman to the third floor guest suite, ma'am. Dr. Allenby is standing by.
Thank you, Wilson. That will be fine.
Thank you, Greta. I'll be with Mr. Rand if I'm needed.
Yes, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am.
I'll see you after the doctor has a look at your leg, Mr. Gardiner.
Eve, child! How nice of you to come.
Hello, Sophie.
And look who you brought with!
Sophie, this is Chauncey Gardiner...
Sophie, this is Chauncey Gardiner...
Oh, I've been just dying to meet you, Mr. Gardiner!
Oh, I've been just dying to meet you, Mr. Gardiner!
Chauncey, this is Mrs. Sophia Rowley.
Come on, Eve. Let's let the men talk, there are so many people that have been asking about you.
Would you two excuse me for a moment?
... How are the kids getting along?
Oh. Well, I just talked to Cindy this morning. She loves California, but to quote her, she says, 'The Secret Service is getting to be a drag.' I guess she wants her privacy...
Oh. Well, I just talked to Cindy this morning. She loves California, but to quote her, she says, 'The Secret Service is getting to be a drag.' I guess she wants her privacy...
Huh... I'm glad they're along with her, if you know what I mean... How about Jack?
Huh... I'm glad they're along with her, if you know what I mean... How about Jack?
Well, I think Jack needs some time alone with you, darling... He's getting to that age, you know... He really misses you...
Well, I think Jack needs some time alone with you, darling... He's getting to that age, you know... He really misses you...
Yeah... I'll have a talk with him as soon as...
... Maybe you should talk to somebody, darling.
No, that won't do any good.
No, that won't do any good.
... Is it me? Is there something I've done?

Oh, no, sweetheart - it's not you...

It's your damn job. It never happened when you were a senator...
It's your damn job. It never happened when you were a senator...
It's not that, I just...
I can certainly understand that...
Of course... I'm so sorry for you, Eve...

Gladly... ... The safe is in Mr. Jennings' bedroom, that'll be stop number one.

I really don't know, Tom - he seems so honest and simple... In a way, he's quite charming...

It's that gardener!
Yes, Chauncey Gardiner.
Yes, Chauncey Gardiner.
No! He's a real gardener!
No! He's a real gardener!
He does talk like one, but I think he's brilliant.

Sally Hayes is not a bitch - she's a damn fine attorney! I've got to talk to her about this Gardiner...

Yes? What have you found?
We have nothing on him, Ambassador Skrapinov.

Sorry, Comrade Ambassador.
Sorry, Comrade Ambassador.
What do you mean there is nothing? That's impossible.
What do you mean there is nothing? That's impossible.
There is no information available on the man before he moved into Benjamin Rand's. It has proven to be such a difficult task that it has resulted in the loss of one of our agents to the United States Government.
But... Where was this man Gardiner before last week?
Apparently the White House shares our curiosity - they have also launched an investigation, and, according to our sources, neither the F.B.I. nor the C.I.A. has met with success.

Hmmm... Take this down. I want this quote included in the Tass coverage; 'Chauncey Gardiner, in an intimate discussion with Ambassador Skrapinov, noted that "Unless the leaders of the opposing political systems move the chairs on which they sit closer to each other, all of their seats will be pulled from under them by rapid social and political changes."'

Very good, Your Excellency.
Kaufman, I'm going to need information on Mr. Chauncey Gardiner's background.
Gardiner, yes, sir.
Gardiner, yes, sir.
And put it through on a Code Red - I want it as soon as possible.
And put it through on a Code Red - I want it as soon as possible.
No problem, Chief.
... Gentlemen, I quoted this man on national television today he is obviously a financial sophisticate of some reknown.
Yes, sir - we are aware of all that, but still, we haven't been able to...
Yes, sir - we are aware of all that, but still, we haven't been able to...

I do not want Benjamin Rand disturbed! You have other ways of gathering information than to trouble a dying man. Use whatever agencies are necessary to put together a detailed history of Chauncey Gardiner, if you run into problems, alert Honeycutt. I'll be in the office at seven in the morning and I would like to have it at that time. I've got to

Right, Chief.
This is not what I requested.
No, sir.
No, sir.
This information goes back three days. I want the standard file, you know that.

I'd like to hear that data, Kaufman.
I'd like to hear that data, Kaufman.
Yes, sir.
... So what does all that add up to?
Well, sir - it occurred to us that he might be an agent of a foreign power. But, we ruled that out, as they invariably are provided with too much documentation, too much American identity... We, uh...don't quite know what to make of it yet, sir... But we'll keep on top of it, Mr. President - we'll come up with the answer.

I would appreciate that.
Sorry to disturb you, chief but we have new developments.
Oh? What?
Oh? What?
We have word that the Soviets have put out a top priority alert for information on Gardiner's background. So far, they haven't come up with a thing - what's more, as a result of their eagerness, one of their ablest agents blew his cover, we have him in custody at this time.

Good. Anything else?
Good. Anything else?
Yes, chief - eight other foreign powers have put Gardiner under surveillance. We're around-the clock now, sir - I'll keep you posted.
The rank-and-file in the FBI feel he is FBI, but others feel he is a CIA man who knows how to destroy FBI files.
That could be possible...
That could be possible...
But we are quite certain, comrade, that this man Gardiner is a leading member of an American elitist faction planning a coup d'etat.

That is correct, Comrade Skrapinov. We have ascertained that Gardiner heads a big-business power group that will soon be taking over the American government.

Well, I'm delighted to be here, my friend. I've missed you. Here, sit down, get off your feet.
Mr. President, I'd like you to meet my dear friend, Mr. Chauncey Gardiner.
Mr. Gardiner, my pleasure.
I just wondered if you had gone over my speech, Ben.
Yes, I did.
Yes, I did.
... Well?
... Well?
Overall - pretty good. But, Mr. President, I think it's very dangerous to resort to temporary measures at this stage of the game.

Well, Ben... I...
Well, Ben... I...
I sympathize with your position, Mr. President, I know how difficult it is to be straightforward, the reaction to such a speech could be chaos.
I sympathize with your position, Mr. President, I know how difficult it is to be straightforward, the reaction to such a speech could be chaos.
That's too big a risk, I can't take the chance.
... There is no longer any margin for inflation, it has gone as far as it can, you've reached your limits on taxation, dependence on foreign energy has reached a crisis, and, from where I see it, Mr. President, the Free Enterprise System has reached the breaking point. We are on the brink of another crash from which recovery might not be possible.
It's that serious, huh?
It's that serious, huh?
I'm afraid so.
No, she flew up to Boston for another charity event. She'll be sorry to have missed you.
I'm sorry, too. Well, Nancy wanted me to send along her best to the two of you - and, Ben, I want to thank you for your time and thoughts.
I'm sorry, too. Well, Nancy wanted me to send along her best to the two of you - and, Ben, I want to thank you for your time and thoughts.
Nonsense, Mr. President - I thank you for coming to spend time with a dying man.
Nonsense, Mr. President - I thank you for coming to spend time with a dying man.
Now, Ben, I won't have any of that. Why don't you listen to your good friend Chauncey this is a time to think of life!
You're right, Mr. President I don't like feeling sorry for myself.
Take care of yourself, Ben.
Take care of yourself, Ben.
You take care too, Bobby.
You take care too, Bobby.
Mr. Gardiner...
John! Great to see you! Sorry about the cunt at reception.

Oh, I will, and I have many, many friends and associates, my friend. All, by the way, in Overeaters Anonymous. All of them fat and alone like me, all of them dream of being someone else, all of them with John Malkovich as their second choice!

Sorry, I'm so late. Lester just wouldn't let me go. Were supposed to have dinner with him on Friday. I can get us out of it if you want. He's really amazing, this insane old lech. It's actually sort of amusing when you get past just how disgusting it is.
Did you eat?
Nah. I'm not hungry. I'm sorry I didn't call. It was just, you know, hard to get away.

How was it?
I have to go back tonight. At eight Exactly.

Why?

Don't crowd me, Craig.
So how was it? What was he doing?
Oh, you know, not a lot. Just hanging around his apartment. I think he must be a lonely man.

Did you know that Eskimos have not one, but fifty words for snow. It's because they have so much of it.
After dinner I'll show you my puppets.
What are you doing?
I'm moving. Remember? What's with the hooded cloak?

I feel that somehow my parents never prepared me to make this particular decision. Not that I blame them. How could they know? Today's world is so complicated. No. I have to go away now. I'm sorry, Lotte. I'm so sorry.
I'm your Goddamn wife. Once you vowed to cherish me forever. Now you hold a gun to my head?
Yeah, well welcome to the nineties.
Yeah, well welcome to the nineties.
Suck my dick!
Suck my dick!
Shut up!
Tell her you need to see her.
You bastard.
Tell her, what the hell, close early today, live dangerously.
What the hell, darling. Close early today, live dangerously.
It was lovely being you being Malkovich, my dear. I'd never seen the passionate side of sweet Maxine before, or her actual tits for that matter. If only, I've been thinking to myself, if only I could actually feel what Malkovich feels, rather than just see what he sees... And then, dare I say it, if only I could control his arms, his legs,
It'll never happen, fuckface.

Yeah but I didn't do anything about it. Out of respect for our marriage.
Yeah but I didn't do anything about it. Out of respect for our marriage.
You didn't do anything about it out of respect for the fact that she wouldn't let you near her with a ten foot pole, which is, by the way, about nine feet, nine inches off the mark anyway.
