Welcome to LesterCorp. May we meet your filing needs?
No, uh, my name is Craig Schwartz. I have an interview with Mr. Lester.

Money, Miss Warts?

Forget it.
Mr. Juarez?
Yes?
Yes?
Yex?
Yex?
I said "yes."
I said "yes."
You suggest what? I have no time for piddling suggestions from mumbling job applicants, my good man. Besides, Dr. Lester will see you now. I think that's what he said.
You're not like the other boys we've had here. Granted, I can't understand what you're saying either, but your soft palette resonates tremendously well and you never ever constrict your epiglottis.
I am a trained performer.
I am a trained performer.
Music to my ears! Whatever you said. Speak, speak, speak, my magnificent friend, speak!
Floris, you're very nice, but I'm afraid Im in love with somebody else.
I'm afraid I... have no idea what you are saying... you bastard!
Come in, Mr. Juarez. I'd stand, but, well, you know.
Actually, my name is Craig Schwartz, Dr. Lester.
Security.
No, it's okay, sir. Just a mixup with your secretary.
No, it's okay, sir. Just a mixup with your secretary.
She's not my secretary. She's what they call an executive liaison, and I'm not banging her, if that's what youre implying.

Glooph is not a letter, sir.
Glooph is not a letter, sir.
Damn, you are good. I tried to trick you. Okay, put these in order.
You don't have a speech impediment, Dr. Lester.
Flattery will get you everywhere, my boy. But I'm afraid I have to trust Floris on this one. You see, she has her doctorate in speech impedimentology from Case Western. Perhaps you've read her memoirs, "I can't understand a word any of you are saying."

No.
No.
Pity, it tells it like it is. That's why the eastern, read Jewish, publishing establishment won't touch it. That's a quote from the book jacket. George Will, I think. I apologize if you can't understan a word I'm saying, Dr. Schwartz.

Thank you for being kind enough to lie. You see, I've been very lonely in my isolated tower of indecipherable speech. You're hired. Any questions?

Just one. Why is this floor so short?
Just one. Why is this floor so short?
Low overhead, m'boy. We pass the savings on to you. But seriously, that's all covered in orientation.
Don't toy with Floris, Schwartz. Why, if I were eighty years younger, I'd box your ears.
I wasn't toying with her, sir. I was just... How old are you?
I wasn't toying with her, sir. I was just... How old are you?
One hundred and five. Carrot juice. Lot's of it. I swear, it's almost not worth it. I piss orange. Oh, and I, have to piss sitting down... like a godamn girly... every fifteen minutes. But nobody wants to die, Schwartz.

I'll keep that in mind, sir.
I'll keep that in mind, sir.
No sir-e-bob, I don't die. But what I do is get older, wrinkled like a former plum that's become the wrinkled prune you see before you. Oh, to be a young man again, maybe then Floris would care for me.

I don't want to be your godamn link, damn you. I want to feel Floris' naked thighs against my own. I want to know passion. I want my body to inspire lust in that beautiful, complex woman. I want her to shiver in a spasm of ecstasy when I penetrate her. Oh, God, the agony of the flesh, Schwartz.

Dr. Lester, while I am flattered that you share your feelings with me, I believe perhaps the workplace is not the most suitable environment for this type of discussion.

All right. Meet me at the Juicy-Juice Juice Bar after work today and I'll spill my goddamn guts for you.
Imagine a room full of women. Nubile, blonde, wet with desire, Schwartz. A harem, if you will. Me in leather. A harness, if you like. I am the object of this desire, and all eyes are on me as I speak. Ladies, I begin. I am the love god, Eros. I intoxicate you. My spunk is to you manna from heaven...
Dr. Lester, it's been really fascinating, but I'm afraid I have to get home to my wife now.

The vacant office. I see. Olive oil. Interesting. Be warned, Schwartz, there are certain doors which should never be opened.
You're making a big mistake, Schwartz. Ma'am
Dr. Lester, I don't know what you're talking about.
Dr. Lester, I don't know what you're talking about.
There are rules, boy, procedures, etiquette. This is not a toy. I've been waiting seventy years to utilize this room, grooming myself, quietly setting the stage, performing ablutions, paying tribute, seeing all his motion pictures again and again. Worshipping, Schwartz, worshipping properly.

My tits?

Christ, you're not a fag are you? Because I don't want to be wasting my time.
That's the usual?
Dont let the girly shit fool you. It'd blow your shorts off.
Im not a homosexual. I just like women for more than their bodies. I guess you could say I'm the new American male.

Please, let me explain.
It's just, and I've never done this before, Maxine, but it's just that I feel something for you. I've never felt this before for anyone, not even my wife. My future is with you, Maxine.
You might want to check those tarot cards one more time.
Don't you want to know what happened to me?
No.
This is important!
It better be.
There's a tiny door in that empty office. It's a portal, Maxine. It takes you inside John Malkovich. You see the world through John Malkovich's eyes, then, after about fifteen minutes, you're spit out into a ditch on the side of The New Jersey Turnpike.
Sounds delightful. Who the fuck is John Malkovich?

Lots of things. He's very well respected. That jewel thief movie, for example. The point is that this is a very odd thing, supernatural, for lack of a better word. It raises all sorts of philosophical questions about the nature of self, about the existence of the soul. Am I me? Is Malkovich Malkovich? Was the Buddha right, is duality an illusion? Do you

Okay. Here it is. Ever want to be someone else? Now you can. No kidding. Only two hundred dollars for fifteen minutes. Visit J.M. Inc., Mertin-Flemmer Building. etc., etc.
Sounds good. Oblique but intriguing. Phone it in.
Craig, I just don't find you attractive. And, Lotte, I'm smitten with you, but only when you're in Malkovich. When I looked into his eyes last night, I could feel you peering out. Behind the stubble and the too-prominent brow and the male pattern baldness, I sensed your feminine longing peering out, and it just slew me.
My God.
This is amazing! We're gonna be rich!
So unbolt the fucking door, Einstein.
You're late.
Are you torturing me on purpose?

Do you have any idea what its like to have two people look at you with total lust and devotion through the same pair of eyes? No I don't suppose you would. It's quite a thrill, Craig.
You're glowing again.
A girl has a right to glow if she wants. It's in the fucking constitution.
Lotte, this is so good...
Move right hand across her left breast now. Move right hand across her left breast now. Move right hand across her left breast now.
Lotte? Is that you?
Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!
Let him try.
Of course, right this way, Mr. Malkovich. Compliments of the house.
What happens when a man climbs through his own portal?
How the hell would I know? I wasn't a philosophy major.
But I gotta go now. I've got to go be Johnny.

Hello, Don.
Hello. Wendy.
Hello. Wendy.
Don, I was wondering, do you know why our workplace has such low ceilings?
Don, I was wondering, do you know why our workplace has such low ceilings?
It's an interesting story, Wendy. Many years ago in the late 1800's, James Mertin, an Irish ship captain looking to invest in the future of our great country, came to this town and decided to erect an office building.
So that's the story of 7 1/2. Since the rents are considerably lower this floor has been adopted by businesses which for one reason or another are forced to cut corners After all... the overhead is low! Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
Hi. Wendy! What're you up to in this vacant office.
Well, Don, I peeked in here, even though I know it's against floor policy. and I discovered that there's a little tiny door in here. Isn't it cute? It's almost like a little dolly's door. I wonder what its for.

That's right, Wendy, it is against floor policy, but as long as you're here, let me tell you what I know about our cute little door friend. Many years ago, this very office was occupied by a kindly old watchmaker named Mr. White.
You've got to tell Craig what's going on. He must never leave Malkovich.
I'm glad you learned sign language, Elijah, but I'm tired of your nagging. I'm tired of this conversation. I'm tired period. What has the world ever done for me that I should feel personally responsible for saving it?
I'm glad you learned sign language, Elijah, but I'm tired of your nagging. I'm tired of this conversation. I'm tired period. What has the world ever done for me that I should feel personally responsible for saving it?
It is better to light one candle than curse the darkness. I learned that from you.
Must you take this terrible demon on yourself, my love?
Yes. I'm the only one. I have to enter Malkovich and destroy him from the inside. If not me, who?
Yes. I'm the only one. I have to enter Malkovich and destroy him from the inside. If not me, who?
If there was any way I could go in your place. But I'm only a monkey and...
If there was any way I could go in your place. But I'm only a monkey and...
Hush, sweetheart.
I'll be with you always, my friends. Who knows, maybe if I'm lucky, I'll rejoin you with wings and a beak.
Wings and a halo, my darling. Wings and a halo.
No.

Well that's perfect. My second choice. Ah, this is wonderful. Too good to be true! You see, I'm a sad man. Sad and fat and alone. Oh, I've tried all the diets, my friends. Lived for a year on nothing but imitation mayonnaise. Did it work? You be the judge. But Malkovich! King of New York! Man about town! Most eligible bachelor! Bon Vivant!

Do tell. I love a good plan.

Why are you being like this?
I missed you. I'm sorry. Tell me the plan.
Well, if Mantini wins, Schwartz will leave Malkovich, right? So, if he needs it, I help Mantini's performance a bit, give him an edge. Spice up the show.

Ouch. Now that's hot. She's using you to channel some dead lesbian lover. Let me know when you're done with her. This is my type of chick.

I gotta know the truth, Kevin.
I gotta know the truth, Kevin.
The truth is for suckers, Johnny-Boy.
You don't look a day over one hundred and five, Captain. What's your secret?
Lots of carrot juice, little lady. That, and a deal with the Devil.
Anybody else?
Do we get to wear a crown?
Do we get to wear a crown?
But of course.
But of course.
Count me in.
Count me in.
Good. I think its time to beckon Mr. Flemmer. Perhaps He can help us out of this pickle.
Tell me, Lotte, can you understand a word I'm saying?
Yes, of course, Dr. Lester.
Yes, of course, Dr. Lester.
Oh, be still my heart.
Oh, be still my heart.
Dr. Lester, would you point me toward the restroom?
Dr. Lester, would you point me toward the restroom?
With immense pleasure, my dear. Down that hall, ninth door on the left. Watch the step down. It's sunken, you know.
I'm getting divorced.
No you mustn't, my child.
No you mustn't, my child.
But why, Son of Malkovich?
But why, Son of Malkovich?
We need you on the inside, my child. To report on his comings and goings, and if need be, to... destroy him... ...for lack of a better word.
I blew it, Dr. Lester.
You followed your heart, my child, and that is not necessarily a bad thing.
You followed your heart, my child, and that is not necessarily a bad thing.
But now we've lost access to Craig.
But now we've lost access to Craig.
My child, I don't think its a great mystery what Craig's up to.
You know I think it pays to leave juice-making to the trained professionals. You look terrible, my dear.
Craig stole Maxine from me, Dr. Lester.

Hmmm, a lesbian, are you? I must inform you that I find that highly arousing.

No, you don't understand. I've been inside Malkovich when I'm with Maxine...
No, you don't understand. I've been inside Malkovich when I'm with Maxine...
What?! That is not allowed. My God, you are supposed to be one of us. You know you must never partake of Malkovich by yourself!
What?! That is not allowed. My God, you are supposed to be one of us. You know you must never partake of Malkovich by yourself!
No, I didn't know that.
No, I didn't know that.
Oh, didn't anyone show you the indoctrination video?
Oh, didn't anyone show you the indoctrination video?
No.
No.
Oh, sorry. Right this way.
Aaaahhhh, the portal!
You bastard!
No! Don't harm the vessel!
It's Craig in there, I can tell.
It's Craig in there, I can tell.
I understand, but we must protect the vessel at all costs. Please, Craig, please step aside and allow us to have what is rightfully ours.
Thank you all for your efforts, but I'm afraid we can no longer get into Malkovich through the portal.
Why not? I need to get in there!
Why not? I need to get in there!
I'm not certain, my dear, but I believe your husband has somehow psychically diverted the route.

That bastard! I'll gladly dispose of him in the name of the order, Son of Malkovich.
That bastard! I'll gladly dispose of him in the name of the order, Son of Malkovich.
I'm afraid that no physical harm must come to him as long as he inhabits the vessel.
Yes, hello, I wanted to place an ad. Hi, are you Craig's wife?
Yes, Hi.
Hi. Have you done Malkovich yet?
Hi, uh. Hi. I wanted to place an ad. Yes. "Ever want to be someone else?" No, that's the ad, but let's talk about you in a minute. "Ever want to be someone else? Now you can. No kidding..."
Don't stand in the way of my actualization as a man, Craig.
Let her go, Craig. I mean him."
And the funny thing is. Mr. Malkovich, my voice is probably the least intriguing thing about me.
I've never been looked at like this by a woman.
Ah.
After that I'll introduce you to my favorite monkey, Elijah. He's got an ulcer, due to a suppressed childhood trauma. But we're getting to the bottom of it. Psychotherapy.
Yes?
I have to see you. Can you call him and invite us over?
I have to see you. Can you call him and invite us over?

J.M. Inc. Be all that someone else can be.
I have to see you.

Sweetie! Oh, but we can't. It's business hours. I need to keep the membranous tunnel open for paying customers.
We have to meet.
One hour.
Maxine! Listen: It hasn't been me in John the last three times. Craig's had me locked up in the apartment. He made me call you at gunpoint. It's been him! Oh, God, it's been him!
Really? Well, you know, he's quite good. I'm surprised. Anyway, I have a session with Malkovich I have to attend. I'll speak with you soon.

Hello, Schwartz. I saw your show.
Did you see the reviews?
Did you see the reviews?
Yeah, I saw them
Yeah, I saw them
Because if you missed any, I just happen to have copies here you can take with you when you leave now.
She's not available.
We'll see, Schwartz. We'll see.
How do we do that?
A friendly competition, if you will. Your Malkovich puppet and my Harry S. Truman puppet appear opposite each other in a play. Not some Vegas Burly-Q pyrotechnics, but a real play that requires actual acting. The audience decides who is more deserving of the title. The losing puppeteer bows out graciously. Goes back to obscurity as a file clerk.

It's just that I fantasize about you and, well, speaking to you now has gotten me sort of excited and...
Can I get you a drink?
Whatever you're having.
Thanks so much for coming over.
Oh, I'm really glad you called.
So, do you enjoy being an actor?
Oh sure. It's very rewarding...
I'm sorry, did you just call me "Lotte"?
Do you mind?
Do you mind?
No, I guess not. I'm an actor.
Oh, my sweet, beautiful Lotte.
Yes, Maxine, yes.
Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes! What the fuck is going on? I'm not talking. This is not me!
Oh, Lotte...
Something was making me talk. Some Goddamn thing was making me move. I gotta get out of here.
Oh, Dollface, it was just your passion for me taking hold.
Oh, Dollface, it was just your passion for me taking hold.

Stay in him forever?
No! But how will we make a living, my love, if our clientele doesn't have access to our product?
No! But how will we make a living, my love, if our clientele doesn't have access to our product?

No one would ever have to know its not him.
No one would ever have to know its not him.
Wait a minute! What if everybody knew? What if we presented Malkovich as the world's most complicated puppet and me as the only puppeteer sophisticated enough to work him? We'd wipe the floor with the Great Mantini!

Shut up! Sorry, dear, I lost control for a minute.
It's okay, my sweet.
Vegas.
Vegas. Can you arrange that?
This is it, lover. You're stepping onto that stage a nobody and presto-change-o, you're coming back the greatest puppeteer the world has ever seen.
I'm nervous. Malkovich is fighting me hard today.
Doesn't he know how important tonight is to us?
He's a selfish bastard.
They love me, darling! "Craig Schwartz is fantastic!" The New York Times. "If only Craig Schwartz had always been inside Malkovich!" Women's Wear Daily. "Craig Schwartz - The world's greatest puppeteer!" Paul Wunder, WBAI Radio.

Bad dream, darling?
I've got to leave Malkovich.
I've got to leave Malkovich.
You've got to be kidding.
You've got to be kidding.
I just had the most horrifying nightmare. The devil was in it.
Honey, we can be happy and poor together.
Perhaps you'll want to consult that Ouija board again.
Yeah what?!

Good-bye, Maxine.
Whatever.

Captain Mertin, surely I am a God-fearing Christian woman like yourself, but alas, I am afraid that the world was not built with me in mind.

So I am forced to work for my

The man is a sex offender. With a record. Spent six months in Chino for exposing himself to an eight- year-old.
Huh.
When he moved down to Venice he had to go door-to-door to tell everyone he's a pederast.
Anyway. How much they offer you?
Twenty grand. And of course I still keep the rug.

I told him if it was during league play--
I figure it's easy money, it's all pretty harmless. I mean she probably kidnapped herself.

Yes you're wrong. This isn't a fucking game, Walter--

Terrific, Walter. But you haven't told me how we get her back. Where is she?
Terrific, Walter. But you haven't told me how we get her back. Where is she?
That's the simple part, Dude. When we make the handoff, I grab the guy and beat it out of him.

Yeah. That's a great plan, Walter. That's fucking ingenious, if I understand it correctly. That's a Swiss fucking watch.
Yeah. That's a great plan, Walter. That's fucking ingenious, if I understand it correctly. That's a Swiss fucking watch.
Thaaat's right, Dude. The beauty of this is its simplicity. If the plan gets too complex something always goes wrong. If there's one thing I learned in Nam--

WHAT?!
I--the royal we, you know, the editorial--I dropped off the money, exactly as per--Look, I've got certain information, certain things have come to light, and uh, has it ever occurred to you, man, that given the nature of all this new shit, that, uh, instead of running around blaming me, that this whole thing might just be, not, you know, not just such a

What in God's holy name are you blathering about?
What in God's holy name are you blathering about?
I'll tell you what I'm blathering about! I got information--new shit has come to light and--shit, man! She kidnapped herself!
Well sure, look at it! Young trophy wife, I mean, in the parlance of our times, owes money all over town, including to known pornographers-- and that's cool, that's cool-- but I'm saying, she needs money, and of course they're gonna say they didn't get it 'cause she wants more, man, she's gotta feed the monkey, I mean-- hasn't that ever occurred to you...?
No. No Mr. Lebowski, that had not occurred to me.
Brandt, give him the envelope.
Well, okay, if you've already made out the check. Brandt is handing him a letter-sized envelope which is distended by something inside.
Well, she's back. No thanks to you.
Where's the money, Lebowski?
We know the briefcase was empty, man. We know you kept the million bucks yourself.
Well, you have your story, I have mine. I say I entrusted the money to you, and you stole it.
Well? Aren't you?
Well. . . yeah.
Well. . . yeah.
All right, get out. Both of you.
Put me down, you son of a bitch!
Walter!
You monsters!
Help me put him back in his chair.
Who the hell is he?
I'll tell you who I am! I'm the guy who's gonna KICK YOUR PHONY GOLDBRICKING ASS!
Look at that fucking phony, Dude! Pretending to be a fucking millionaire!
I said out. Now.
I said out. Now.
Let me tell you something else. I've seen a lot of spinals, Dude, and this guy is a fake. A fucking goldbricker.
This guy fucking walks. I've never been more certain of anything in my life!
Stay away from me, mister!
Oh, shit.
You're bullies! Cowards, both of you!
Shit, sorry man.
Stay away from me! You bullies! You and these women! You won't leave a man his fucking balls!
Smokey Huh?
Over the line, Smokey! I'm sorry. That's a foul.
Over the line, Smokey! I'm sorry. That's a foul.
Bullshit. Eight, Dude.
Bullshit. Eight, Dude.
Excuse me! Mark it zero. Next frame.
Excuse me! Mark it zero. Next frame.
Bullshit. Walter!
Bullshit. Walter!
This is not Nam. This is bowling. There are rules.
Yeah, but--
Am I wrong!?
Am I wrong!?
Yeah, but I wasn't over. Gimme the marker, Dude, I'm marking it an eight.
I'm not--
A world of pain.
Walter--
YOU THINK I'M FUCKING AROUND HERE? MARK IT ZERO!!
YOU THINK I'M FUCKING AROUND HERE? MARK IT ZERO!!
All right! There it is! It's fucking zero!
You happy, you crazy fuck?
This is a league game, Smokey!
You come all the way down here to roust--
I came all the way down here same as you did. Keep from gettin' killed. Happened to see those jarheads beatin' on a good collar-- Habla Ingles, Tomas?
Tom here's my ninth hard felon of the month. Six weeks he'll be sucking gas. In three years I'll be working Central Warrants. Jewboy Deputy D.A. over there wets his pants for fighters. Promised me the next spot he can wangle.
Impressive.
Impressive.
Wanna hear something more impressive? My first twenty fights were stumblebums handpicked by my manager. My girlfriend saw you fight a couple times over at the Olympic. Says maybe you <i>could</i> take me.
Whatta we do about the Mex?
We'll take 'em in the morning.
We'll take 'em in the morning.
<i>You'll</i> take him.
<i>You'll</i> take him.
He's half yours, partner.
He's half yours, partner.
He's all yours. And I'm not your partner.
He's all yours. And I'm not your partner.
Someday.
What?
They tell bedtime stories about you. Blade the big, bad boogie-man. Frankly, I'm disappointed. That you were willing to come along so easily, I mean. Without any assurances.
Why?
Survival.
Seems like he's doing me a favor, then.
You're missing the point. Their vampire victims don't die. They turn. They become carriers. If the Reapers continue unchecked, there could be thousands of them before the month is over. Do the math.
Two years.
Then they weren't created to go after your "patient zero".
Then they weren't created to go after your "patient zero".
No. They've been training to hunt you.
You've been training two years to take me out. Here I am, the big, bad vampire hunter. So do it.
What the hell are you doing, Blade?
What the hell are you doing, Blade?
We're going to be working as a unit, you people will be taking orders from me. So let's get it over with. I'll give you a free shot, Reinhardt.
Where to first?
The House of Pain.
This is our world you're entering. You may see things -- feeding. Just remember why you're here.
I haven't forgotten.
What is it with you people and pain?
We need it. Sensations are addictive and pain cuts the deepest. Tattoos, piercings, tribal scarring -- because we regenerate, none of it's permanent. So we have to take it to the next level. To remind us we're alive.
What was that?
Nothing.
You're hurt.
I'll heal.
I'll heal.
What about Nomak?
What about Nomak?
He escaped. You didn't tell me they were immune to silver and garlic.
He escaped. You didn't tell me they were immune to silver and garlic.
I didn't know.
how long since he was bitten?
Minutes.
Recognize him?
From the surveillance footage in the bloodbank. He was one of the guard's Nomak attacked.
From the surveillance footage in the bloodbank. He was one of the guard's Nomak attacked.
Which means he turned about seventy-two hours ago.
Which means he turned about seventy-two hours ago.
Right. So why is he dying? He doesn't appear to have any broken bones, no entry wounds of any kind -- what's killing him?
Right. So why is he dying? He doesn't appear to have any broken bones, no entry wounds of any kind -- what's killing him?
Time.
No hemoglobin left. Their metabolisms are too fast. They burn out. That's why they're having to feed so often. Their systems are self destructing.
If that's true, what about Nomak? He's been alive longer than the others.
If that's true, what about Nomak? He's been alive longer than the others.
Nomak's different. He's the carrier. There's something driving him beyond the Thirst. Something we're missing.
I've never seen anything like this. The Reapers are as different from us as we are from you. It's almost as if the virus is re-wiring their bodies, creating new, parasitic organs which consume the old ones.
Like cancer with a purpose.
Like cancer with a purpose.
Exactly. Look at the digestive system. It's been drastically simplified. Super charged. And this --
He's right about one thing. We do have to survive.
You don't have to hunt to do it.
You don't have to hunt to do it.
Really? What are we supposed to do, then? Starve ourselves because we fee on others in order to live? What about that scumbag you just let off the hook? A nothing. A drug-dealer. How do you justify saving people like that?
Blade. We've got six Reapers. They're all dead.
Fry 'em.
Blade.
Save it. I don't want to hear your words. Let's do this NOW!!!
Each day is a little life.
What?
What?
"Each day is a little life. Every waking and rising a little birth, every fresh morning a little youth, every going to rest and sleep a little death."
Anyone else make it?
I don't think so.
Thank you.
For what?
For what?
It would've been easy for you to let me die back there today, but you didn't.
It would've been easy for you to let me die back there today, but you didn't.
I wouldn't read too much into it.
You don't want to go there.
Why?
Why?
Because one of us is going to kill the other before this ends.
Because one of us is going to kill the other before this ends.
It doesn't have to be like that. We don't have to be enemies.
It doesn't have to be like that. We don't have to be enemies.
Get real. I was useful to Damaskinos as long as the hunt was still on. Now that it's over, all bets are off.
Get real. I was useful to Damaskinos as long as the hunt was still on. Now that it's over, all bets are off.
If that's true, then why'd you save me?
Why do you hate us so much?
I am a hunter. A weapon. It's what I do. It's in my blood.
I am a hunter. A weapon. It's what I do. It's in my blood.
Well it's in mine, too. I'm a pureblood. I wasn't turned. I was born this way. Just like you. Am I evil because I want to survive? What about a wolf? What about any predator?
You're hurting me.
Pain cuts the deepest, isn't that what you said?
It means "bloodbrother."
I don't understand.
How does it look?
Not good.
What do you want me to do?
I want to see the sun rise.
How do you feel?
Like a fucking heifer took a dump in my mouth.
You came back for me.
Did you think I wouldn't?
Did you think I wouldn't?
Took you long enough.
Let's just hope you've kicked the Thirst for good. I'll be watching you close. You start to back-slide --
You put a bullet in my brain. Wouldn't expect anything else.
I agree. We play along for now, we might wind up learning something about how their world ticks.
Either that or feeding the worms.
What do you think?
Sounds like a plan.
Sounds like a plan.
What do you really think?
What do you really think?
These guys are shitting bricks cause they're no longer on the top of the food chain. They're going to fuck us the first chance they get.
He's right. They'll smell that you're human. Stay here, watch our backs.
I don't like it.
I don't like it.
I'm not giving you a choice, old man.
I thought you were supposed to be watching our backs.
Ran into a little Reaper trouble myself.
Where were you, Whistler?
I'll show you.
You ask me, you and Miss Muffet are getting a mite too cozy for my taste.
I wouldn't worry about it.
I am worrying. Seems to me, you're starting to get confused as to which side of the line you're standing on.
Pretty hollow words coming from a man who spent the last year running with the enemy.
Pretty hollow words coming from a man who spent the last year running with the enemy.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
It means I'm starting to wonder if the vampires still have their hooks in you. You've been acting strange ever since I gave you the cure. Reckless, quick to anger -- You said it yourself, Whistler. Those vampires knew our defense system backwards and forwards. Where'd they get their intel?
Eau de suckhead. Tasty.
We'll split into three units. First team that makes contact wins the prize. Try to maintain radio silence from here on out.
Your security's for shit, kid.
Where the hell have you been?
Where the hell have you been?
Just out connecting a few dots.
What's your problem, Whistler?
Why don't you ask your girlfriend?
I did some checking on that Carter Stevens character. That familiar of theirs who claimed he was with the NIH? Turns out he used to work for them, but he doesn't anymore.
Then who does he work for?
Come on, Blade. Talk to me!
Blood...
And so will we.
Look, I care about the humans who are dying, not you, got it?
Look, I care about the humans who are dying, not you, got it?
Spare me the race card, OJ. We're not going out into the sun. It's too risky.
Spare me the race card, OJ. We're not going out into the sun. It's too risky.
You don't have a choice. You're just going to have to protect yourselves as best you can.
Must be hundreds of these skeletons here.
So?
So?
So I think you people may have underestimated how many Reapers you're dealing with.
Put it back in park, Blade.
Thought you were dead.
Thought you were dead.
Seems like there's a lot of that going around these days.
It has been said, you may have enemies whom you hate, but not enemies whom you despise. Be proud of your enemy: then his success shall be yours, too. In that regard, I should thank you.
For what?
You want me to hunt them for you.
Not alone.
The genetic material you spliced into Nomak -- Where did you get it?
I should think that would be obvious at this point.
True, but thanks to you, we know his weakness. We can keep him contained. It's just a matter of time before we hunt him down.
Too bad you're out of it.
And why is that?
Revenge. That's what Nomak wanted all along. To pay back the people who created him.
You got something in mind, Blade?
Ultra-rapid detox. They use it on heroin addicts, make 'em go cold-turkey in one night.
Gonna try and OD Whistler on a retroviral cure.
I don't know about this, man --
Motion sensors. Looks like Zone Three.
Human?
So you're going to do this?
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer. Isn't that how the saying goes?
What's going on?
He was here. Watching us.
He was here. Watching us.
Nomak?
Nomak?
He wants us to know he's hunting us now.
Kiss your ass goodbye, Reinhardt.
You're wasting your time, Blade. The flechette's a dud.
So that's down and dirty. Got anything to say for yourself?
Two things. One, I was on to you the moment they turned you. And two -- I switched that dud of yours back with the real one.
Hey, hey! The fuck you doing?!
Getting your attention, Paco.
Getting your attention, Paco.
Well you've got it, warmblood. Now what the fuck are you gonna do with it?
Oh yeah? Like how little? In case you hadn't noticed, we lost two men while you were out farting around.
You need to ratchet those 'nads of yours down a few notches, paco.
Listen, hillbilly, you are a cunt-hair away from cowboy heaven.
Ain't no thing but a chicken wing, buttercup.
We want to attract them, not scare them off.
Yeah, but you fangs can see in the dark. What am I supposed to do?
What the fuck you doing?
Ain't nobody here but you and me, chicken wing. I'd say this is as good a time as any to settle up.
His name is Jared Nomak.
Thiavolos, as we used to say in Greece. The Devil. Pure Thirst. Nothing more. He was born a vampire, but he is an anomaly. Like you. Unlike the rest of us, however, he feeds on not just humans, but vampires as well.
I would hate to think you were losing your perspective. Who do you think God favors in the web? The spider or the fly?
Nomak said something to Blade in Greek. Athelfiki singenia ex amato. Where did he learn that?
Nomak said something to Blade in Greek. Athelfiki singenia ex amato. Where did he learn that?
From his father, of course.
From his father, of course.
You experimented on your own, son?
We're locked in.
Are you insane? He'll kill us both!
Are you insane? He'll kill us both!
Maybe it's better that way.
Yes?
They've made contact with the Reapers.
They've made contact with the Reapers.
Any casualties?
Any casualties?
Two so far.
An inevitability, I suppose. Nyssa was not among them, I trust.
No. This is a dangerous game, you're playing, Damaskinos.
No. This is a dangerous game, you're playing, Damaskinos.
Any game worthy of being played is. One must be patient. In this way, I have outlived my enemies. All of them.
You worry too much, Stevens. I have assurance from our friend inside that events are unfolding as scripted.
As scripted? You've already lost two of your own. How many more are you willing to sacrifice?
I see from your questionnaire that you don't have any immediate next of kin?
Not that I'm in contact with.
Not that I'm in contact with.
Nobody to call in case of an emergency?
Nobody to call in case of an emergency?
No -- Does that mean I can't be a donor?
No -- Does that mean I can't be a donor?
It depends. We came up with some unusual results on your blood test.
Your blood has a very rare phenotype, one that's quite valuable to people like us.
Us? What are you talking about?
Tell me something, Skid --
Scud.
Scud.
Whatever -- What'd you do to the Charger?
Whatever -- What'd you do to the Charger?
The pimp-mobile? Just made a few after market modifications. Nitrous-oxide injection system, forged aluminum pistons and crankshaft, higher flowing fuel pump.

Fuck yeah. Whole package'll crank this betty up another three-hundred horsepower.
Fuck yeah. Whole package'll crank this betty up another three-hundred horsepower.
And you'll burn the damn thing out before your next fucking oil change.
Where'd you dig up this shit-bird anyway?
Look, what's your problem?
Hey, you think I don't know what's at stake here? We practically compromised our whole operation to save your puckered old ass! And for what?
Our operation?! Our operation?! I built this operation, you fucking turd stain.
This whole deal's giving me a serious case of the butt-willies.
Look, kid, they obviously found your base of operations. If it was a trap, why flip their dicks by announcing themselves?
The hell are you fiddling with there?
Tweaked the phosphor rod, modified the collimated beam, wanna concentrate the light, get something like a UV laser going.

You're wasting your time, already been tried.
You're wasting your time, already been tried.
Yeah, but you didn't have the Scudster working on it, did you?
Yeah, but you didn't have the Scudster working on it, did you?
Nope. Back then we did not.
Nope. Back then we did not.
So how long have you known Blade, anyway?
So how long have you known Blade, anyway?
Going on twenty years now.
Going on twenty years now.
Blade doesn't talk about the old days much.
Blade doesn't talk about the old days much.
Blade doesn't talk about anything much. What about you, though?
Pretty.
I was backpacking. Hooked up with these two chicks who were off to see the Burning Man festival. We were gonna take "E", have ourselves a little freeball out in the desert. You know the riff, "Dear Penthouse, I never thought this would happen to me, but --"
What about you? You're not coming?
After last night? Dude, I'm a lover, not a fighter.
Yeah, your little cootchie knew.
You little shit. When did they get to you?
You little shit. When did they get to you?
Back when Blade had me hunting down your puckered old ass. What's up with your hair, anyway? Fucking Willie Nelson look-a-like?
Whistler!
Are we bringing home strays now?
She's been bitten.
You should've killed her, then.
You should've killed her, then.
She hasn't turned yet. You can help her.
I had to increase the dose. You're building up a resistance to the serum --
Just do it, old man.
Stupidity.
Maybe not. I did some checking, she's a hematologist. Knowledge like that might come in handy.
Maybe not. I did some checking, she's a hematologist. Knowledge like that might come in handy.
It's not worth the risk. We can't trust her.
Get in. Youre leaving.
Wait.
What took you so long?
Don't even start, old man.
Going somewhere?
China Town. I need more serum. What's all this?
Don't try to talk --
Listen. You have to -- finish me off. You don't want me coming back.
Listen. You have to -- finish me off. You don't want me coming back.
No, we can treat the wounds --
Whistler, I --
I know. Just be quick about it, will you? Do it right.
Beautiful day, isn't it?
How can you be out here?
How can you be out here?
I dabble in pharmaceuticals, medical research. We've developed a type of sun-blocker using octyl salicylate, a few others things.
It's not very effective in direct sunlight, but it's a start. The goal, of course, is to be like you, "the Day-walker".
I don't buy it.
I don't buy it.
Why not? The future of our race runs through your bloodstream. You've got the best of both worlds, Blade. All of our strengths and none of our weaknesses.
Why not? The future of our race runs through your bloodstream. You've got the best of both worlds, Blade. All of our strengths and none of our weaknesses.
Maybe I don't see it that way.
Maybe I don't see it that way.
Oh, so it's back to pretending we're human again, is it? Spare me the Uncle Tom routine. You can't keep denying what you are. You're one of us, Blade. You always have been.
Oh, so it's back to pretending we're human again, is it? Spare me the Uncle Tom routine. You can't keep denying what you are. You're one of us, Blade. You always have been.
You're wrong.
You're wrong.
Am I? You think the humans will ever accept a half-breed like you? They can't. They're afraid of you. The humans fear us because we're superior. They fear us because in their hearts they know their race has become obsolete.
The pause that refreshes -- Care for some? Smells good, doesn't it? Pungent, with just an irrepressible hint of iron.
Pass.
Pass.
You sure now? I bled a newborn for this. You won't find a drink that's sweeter.
You're not going anywhere.
Watch me.
No longer.
Frost!!!
Who dies first?
Take him.
Guess you're not quite as invulnerable as you thought.
You're wrong -- a few minutes more, and my transition will be complete. Even your sword won't be able to affect me then.
You're wrong -- a few minutes more, and my transition will be complete. Even your sword won't be able to affect me then.
You don't have a few minutes, Frost.
You're too human, Blade.
It's because I'm human that I can do this.
Is something wrong, my friend?
You're blind --
You're blind --
There are other ways to see. Sit.
Hold out your hands.
I didn't come here to get my palms read. I need something translated.
I didn't come here to get my palms read. I need something translated.
Show me.
This is an old tongue, from an old world. It concerns LaMagra.
Who is LaMagra?
Who is LaMagra?
The vampire God. This speaks of His return.
The Day Walker's blood is a disparador -- a trigger, you see? For LaMagra's return. One need only consume it and the spirit of his ancestors will settle upon him. "And the Sleeper will rise from the shadows anew, cleansing the world in a Tide of Blood."
"The Blood Tide".
"The Blood Tide".
Yes. The vampire apocalypse. It is said that all who feel its taint will succumb to the Thirst.
Yes. The vampire apocalypse. It is said that all who feel its taint will succumb to the Thirst.
How do I stop it?
I am tired. Dawn is coming.
But I just got here --
But I just got here --
You've been here longer than you think.
You shouldn't be here.
I'm sorry, I --
-- he's a vampire.
You're joking --
Why?
Because you're tainted. The venom's still inside you. You could still turn on us.
Because you're tainted. The venom's still inside you. You could still turn on us.
What happens then?
And you honestly expect me to believe all this?
I don't care what you believe. I saved your life once, I don't plan on making a habit of it. You want my advice, you'll be out of the city by nightfall. If you're stupid enough to stay, that's your business.
I don't care what you believe. I saved your life once, I don't plan on making a habit of it. You want my advice, you'll be out of the city by nightfall. If you're stupid enough to stay, that's your business.
I can't just leave. I have a life here, a career --
I can't just leave. I have a life here, a career --
Not anymore. You've seen one of them. You won't be allowed to live after that.
I can go to the police. I have blood samples back at the hospital. I can show them.
Do it. You'll be dead before you can file the complaint.
Do it. You'll be dead before you can file the complaint.
That's ridiculous! No one's that powerful.
How did you know?
Figured they'd send someone after you. Thought I'd wait around and see who showed up.
Figured they'd send someone after you. Thought I'd wait around and see who showed up.
You used me as bait?!
You used me as bait?!
It worked, didn't it?
It worked, didn't it?
But, he could've --
But, he could've --
He didn't. Get over it.
But he's a policeman --
He's a familiar. A human who works for the vampires. See this mark?
That's a glyph, kind of like a vampire cattle brand. That means Officer Friendly here is someone's property. Any of the other vampire's try to bleed him, they'll have to answer to Friendly's owner -- This glyph belongs to Deacon Frost. We've been tracking him for a while now --
Why in God's name would anyone want to work for them?
Why in God's name would anyone want to work for them?
Because they're vampire wanna-bes. If they're loyal, if they prove themselves, then their masters will turn them.
Because they're vampire wanna-bes. If they're loyal, if they prove themselves, then their masters will turn them.
And that's a good thing?
And that's a good thing?
For some. Live forever, never get old. The ultimate high.
What are you doing?!
Preventive medicine.
You can't do this, he's human, it's murder.
It's war, now get the fuck out of the way!
Look, if what you say is true, if there's a chance I could turn into one of them, then I've got no choice, do I? I have to work with you. I need to learn everything I can about them. It's the only way I'll be able to find a cure for myself.
There is no cure.
There is no cure.
You don't know that.
What are you looking at?
What do you see here?
What do you see here?
Graffiti --
Graffiti --
Look closer.
I know this place -- it's a blood bank.
Owned by vampires. There's one of these in every major city, and just like Domino's, they always deliver. You telling me you're ready to walk through that door?
You let him go -- An hour ago you were ready to kill a man for less, this one didn't even talk.
He will.
Looks like we hit pay-dirt. This place is crawling with them. See the valets over there? They're vampires. So is the doorman.
How can you tell?
How can you tell?
The way they move, they way they smell --
So many of them -- I still can't believe they're real.
There are worse things than vampires out there.
There are worse things than vampires out there.
Like what?
Like what?
Like me.
What is this place?
Some kind of archive --
Some kind of archive --
Isn't this all a little high-tech? I thought vampires were more into cobwebs and coffins.
Isn't this all a little high-tech? I thought vampires were more into cobwebs and coffins.
You've been watching too much TV. They've got their claws sunk into everything -- finance, real estate, politics. Probably own half of Downtown.
You're hurt --
Nothing that won't heal by dawn.
What am I injecting you with?
Serum -- it's a human hemoglobin substitute.
It's dark in here.
You get used to the darkness.
I can't close my eyes without hearing her scream.
Those aren't real memories. No one has that kind of recall.
Those aren't real memories. No one has that kind of recall.
I do. I remember from day one. People staring at me, sensing I was different. Watching the fear grow in their eyes, knowing in their hearts I wasn't human.
I do. I remember from day one. People staring at me, sensing I was different. Watching the fear grow in their eyes, knowing in their hearts I wasn't human.
If you're not human, then why do you bleed like us? I've seen vampire blood, you don't have it running through your veins.
Just get out of here.
Blade --
I made a trip to the hospital last night, borrowed some equipment.
For your miracle cure?
Is he sick?
Cancer.
You care about him, don't you?
We've got a good arrangement, that's all. Whistler makes the weapons, I use them, the vampires die -- end of story.
My mother used to say that a cold heart is a dead heart.
Your mother sounds like a Hallmark greeting card.
Any progress?
Some. It's been slow --
Some. It's been slow --
You don't look so good.
You don't look so good.
I'm just tired, that's all. We've been up all night.
For what it's worth, I'm sorry.
You make it sound like I'm already dead.
Are you all right?
I've been better --
I've been better --
How long have we been driving?
How long have we been driving?
I don't know. I woke up just before you did --
Is it bad?
We get out of this alive, maybe I'll take that miracle cure of yours.
It won't work on you.
What are you talking about?
Get out of here --
I'm not leaving without you.
I'm not leaving without you.
You don't understand. The Thirst --
-- tearing me -- apart.
I know. Take some of my blood.
I know. Take some of my blood.
No --
No --
It's the only way. You know that. We'll never get out of here alive if you don't.
I can't -- I won't be able to stop --
Yes you will. The human side of you is stronger. I know it is.
I never imagined I'd be so happy to see the sun rise -- It's over, isn't it?
For them. But for me --
How's it going, Kam?
You're a week early.
You're a week early.
I was in the neighborhood.
Whistler says I'm building up a resistance to it.
I was afraid that might happen.
I was afraid that might happen.
Maybe it's time to start exploring other alternatives.

There's only one alternative to the serum.
But you -- died --
Deacon brought me back.
Deacon brought me back.
Fight him --
Please --
Listen to your father, Jason. It's going to be a better world.
How could you be a part of this?
These are my people now. I'm one of them.
These are my people now. I'm one of them.
You don't have to be.
You don't have to be.
You don't understand. I've killed, I've hunted, and I've enjoyed it.
I wish you could see the world as I do. Deacon opened my eyes. There's no turning back from that.
I don't believe that.
I don't believe that.
You will. Time is on our side. Sooner or later, the Thirst always wins.
This isn't human blood.
Then what is it?
Then what is it?
I don't know -- Look at this blood smear --
The red blood cells are biconvex, which is theoretically impossible. They're hypochromic, there's virtually no hemoglobin in them. Look at the PMNs, they're binucleated, they should be mononucleated.
What about the chemistry panel?
Curtis, it's three in the morning. I'm really not in the mood for one of your practical jokes.
It's not a joke. I've got the stiff sitting in the morgue right now -- look, just come up and see him, okay? Five minutes, that's all I ask.

I thought you promised to give me some distance?
I thought you promised to give me some distance?
This is purely professional curiosity, Karen, I swear.
Five minutes, not a second more. And I don't want to hear a word about "us".
No problem.
You haven't started in on the internal organs?
Just the blood sample from the pericardial sac.
That's weird --
What?
What?
He looks different now, burns are less extreme, some of these wounds have closed up --
Tell me something, honestly, you ever have second thoughts about us?
Sometimes --
-- but then I remember what an ass-hole you were and I'm snapped back to reality.
Jesus, Karen, you're breaking my heart here --
Blade. Once again, our interests have fallen victim to his ridiculous crusade. He must be destroyed.
You're wrong, Dragonetti.
The Day Walker represents a unique opportunity. We'd be fools to waste it by killing him.
Deacon Frost. You refuse to speak our language, you insult the House of Erebus by using the humans' gutter-tongue, have you no respect for tradition?
Deacon Frost. You refuse to speak our language, you insult the House of Erebus by using the humans' gutter-tongue, have you no respect for tradition?
Why should I respect something which has outlived its purpose?
I see. And what would you have us do with this "half-breed"?
Study him. Unlock the secrets of his DNA. He's the key we've been looking for.
Study him. Unlock the secrets of his DNA. He's the key we've been looking for.
He is an abomination!
The shadows suit us, Frost. We've existed this way for thousands of years. Who are you to challenge our ways?
Someone who's sick of living off scraps. The coming age belongs to us, not the humans! When the final war between our races comes, who do you want leading the charge?
These archives are restricted to members of the House of Erebus.
Please. You and the other Elders wouldn't know what to do with these texts if your lives depended on it. Which, of course, they do.

You're wasting your time, Frost. Far greater scholars than you have tried to decipher these words. Whatever secrets they hold have been lost.
You're wasting your time, Frost. Far greater scholars than you have tried to decipher these words. Whatever secrets they hold have been lost.
Perhaps.
How do you like that? Right on time.
The other elders will never let you get away with this!
How many of you are there?
A few thousand scattered about the globe. In the past, we've had to restrict our numbers for fear of discovery. That won't be necessary after tonight.

What happens then?
What happens then?
The Blood Tide. Our long-prophesied holy war against the humans. There's a force, you see -- a spirit that exists in our blood. I've discovered a way to invoke it.

LaMagra --
LaMagra --
That's right. The answers were there all along, of course, scribbled down in the forgotten languages of my kind. Waiting for someone with the patience to decipher them. My elders were foolish enough to dismiss them as wives tales. But I knew better. Imagine my surprise when Blade turned out to be the key which would set that force free.
LaMagra isn't a physical being. He's a spirit, requiring a flesh and blood host in order to manifest himself.
You.
You.
Who better to usher in the Blood Tide?
There's no need for any of this. Your condition can be treated. Whistler and I were working on a cure when --
What makes you think we want to be cured? Blood is only part of the equation. The hunt, the killing, that's what the Thirst is really about.

But you use blood banks --
But you use blood banks --
Only as a last resort. Preserved blood is inferior. There's no flavor left to it, no life. Fortunately, I've found a way around that particular obstacle.
You're a monster.
Why? Because we live at another species' expense? Your people farm cattle and veal, don't they? Fattening them up with steroids? It's called evolution, Doctor. Survival of the fittest.
Blade --
You're wasting your breath, woman. He can't hear you now. It's the Thirst, you see? It already has him in its grip.
I was wrong about you, Blade. You were never one of us. You're a traitor to your race.
Get away from him!
What -- ?
You've been bitten by a vampire. We've got to try and burn out the venom, just like a rattlesnake bite --
Who are you people?
My name is Abraham Whistler. This is Blade. As for our little homunculus here --
So what do you use, then? A stake?
Some of the old wives' tales are true -- they're severely allergic to silver, various types of wood. Feed them garlic and they'll go into anaphylactic shock --
Consider it a parting gift. Vampire mace -- silver nitrate, essence of garlic.
So that's it? You guys just patch me up and send me on my way?
So that's it? You guys just patch me up and send me on my way?
There is one other thing. I'd buy yourself a gun if I were you. If you start becoming sensitive to the daylight, if you start becoming thirsty regardless of much you've had to drink -- then I suggest you take that gun and use it on yourself. Better that, than the alternative.
We keep in radio contact.
You've been listening in the whole time?
You've been listening in the whole time?
You think I'd let him run loose without a chaperone? Blade ferrets their rat-holes out, I map them. Then we blow them all to kingdom come.
Whistler!
Go on, I'll be fine!
Why didn't you tell me the truth about him?
We weren't sure we could trust you.
Blade's unique, you know. A one in a billion anomaly. He can withstand sunlight, garlic, even silver. But he still has the Thirst.
What happens if he doesn't take the serum?
What happens if he doesn't take the serum?
The Thirst overcomes him, just like the others. It's not something he can control. The problem is, time's running out. His body's starting to reject the serum. And so far, all my efforts to find a cure have ended in failure --

No offense, Whistler, but you're not exactly working with state of the art equipment here. You might have missed something.
No offense, Whistler, but you're not exactly working with state of the art equipment here. You might have missed something.
Which is why you're here. We could use someone with your experience.
Why do you hunt them?
Habit, mostly, just like this.
I had a family once -- a wife, three daughters. Then a drifter named Deacon Frost came calling one evening --
He killed them?
He killed them?
Eventually. He toyed with them first. He made me choose, do you understand? Which order they would die in --
How did you escape?
I didn't. He was cruel enough to let me live. Even gave me a souvenir to remember him by.
And now you're using Blade to exact your revenge?
Frost's bodycount keeps rising, and I'm not getting any younger, am I?
I wouldn't go in there if I were you. It's best to leave him alone when he's like this.
I'll take my chances.
All right, let's start with the basics -- why do vampires need to drink blood?
Their own blood can't sustain hemoglobin.
Their own blood can't sustain hemoglobin.
Then vampirism is a genetic defect, just like Hemolytic anemia?
Basically you'd have to re-write the victim's DNA, alter it so that the DNA will produce proteins capable of generating hemoglobin.
How?
How?
With a retrovirus. It's injected into the bone marrow cells, it causes the host's DNA to mutate. They've been using them to treat Sickle-cell anemia.
On me, yes. On Blade, I'm not so sure -- The problem is, Blade didn't contract the vampire virus from a bite like I did. He was born with it. The irony is, I could probably cure every vampire but him.
Then we're back to square one, aren't we? Sooner or later, the Thirst always wins.
What happened to the power?
I don't know, but the back-up generator should've kicked in.
--and if she ever did--

--or incredibly fucking naive.
Hey, folklore--
Why don't you just cut it down and count the goddamn rings--who <u>cares</u>?
Because it means the tree is older than the house.

Made no sense. Scared out of their minds, and the greatest stress reliever in creation right at their fingertips. Nada.

Try a long walk.
We should be so lucky.
Butt-ugly owl.
What're you, crazy??
What're you, nuts?
Get <u>out</u> of here!
What're you doing with all this shit?
--yeah, a hand or something--
--coming out of the water--
Me, too.
Hey, I got a whole editing suite in my loft--more the fucking merrier.
What about night?
Not a great idea. Especially 'cross the street.
Used to be a meat-packing plant. Slaughter on the ground floor-- carcasses schlepped up on this thing for dissection and grinding and--
--Cotter: shut up.

What?
Get inside quick, they'll stop.
Too busy eating us?

Just go.

Hey, hon'--this is what pays the rent and tuition.
English.
I spend a lot of time on e-Bay. Buying, selling--sometimes buying then re-selling at substantial mark-up, sometimes just selling crap I find in the street.
Whatta you got, telescopic vision?
Still don't see it--
Where <u>is</u> it?
I got the tape enhanced--and I managed to sleaze a photo blow-up. Jesus, he's gonna kill me when he finds out about the camera.

Gimme it!
Where's Domini?
My room, asleep, last I checked.
Fire escape??
Don't have one.
She would've had to have a key, anyway, to lock the deadbolt behind her.
Well, she got out of here <u>some</u>- how because she's not here!!
Same trees. They took Elly Kedward out to the same kind of trees.
--I look and look in the tree, all I ever see, he's always there watching, that stupid owl, over and over--
--I look and look in the tree, all I ever see, he's always there watching, that stupid owl, over and over--

--Cotter, where can I get on-line?
--anywhere, anywhere, all up and live, all the time--fucking owl--
Cotter?
Fucking owl!
Fucking owl!
You think it's possible the tree in the Parr foundation is the same one they tied Elly Kedward to?
You think it's possible the tree in the Parr foundation is the same one they tied Elly Kedward to?
No idea--goddamitt!
Boy Kurth.
Heather, does that look like Domini there?
Where?
Down there in the Park.
Not the place you want to announce your arrival.
How's she going to know where to--
How's she going to know where to--
--things got a way of finding <u>you</u> here.
It's <u>freezing</u>.
Next time try putting on shoes--
What the fuck--??
--I don't know.
The moon trying to shoot down through all these trees--can make things funky--
--I saw what I saw.
--I saw what I saw.
Yeah. Me too.
Yeah. Me too.

Be it still alive, James?
<u>What</u>--
I'd strongly advise you to join us--
--before you lose your emotional lunch.
Nobody's going anywhere--
--hell, I don't think I'm ever leaving this place again--
--hell, I don't think I'm ever leaving this place again--
--one of us, all of us--I have no idea--brought whatever this thing is back here. We're not going to go out there and spread it around like Typhoid Mary. We're gonna figure it out, we're gonna bring a goddamn <u>end</u> to it.
That's a "j."
For "James?"
For "James?"
Goes right along with these two.
Who?
No one ever comes here.
--f'chrissake, Heather, it's not like the two of us are gonna doze off he leaves for two seconds--
--I don't trust anybody, not even me, anymore--
--I don't trust anybody, not even me, anymore--
--shhhh! #5, there's something up there!
--it's the "Blair Witch Cult"--a copy-- some pages from--one of them on the site must've gotten my message--
--who?
--who?
Doesn't say--it's just these pages.
Remember....what Mary Brown said-- she could see the witch's hands on my face, her mouth sucking on mine.
Anna's the witch.
Hold this.
What?
What?
The wheel.
This is her equally on-the-rag boy- friend, Nick Leavitt--

We're not making Blair Witch II here.
I am.
Cotter?
I'm not finished.
I'm not finished.
We're all going to be if you don't hit the brakes.
You drive, I'll handle the video, okay?
Fine.
What're you doing?
This isn't about us.
This isn't about us.
Right. And the check's in the mail.
Was it <u>every</u> day or just semi- weekly you got your ass kicked as a kid?
<u>Now</u> you can bring the vehicle to a stop: there on the left.
Either way, maybe there's a book in it, and they both make a ton of money.
It's a <u>serious</u> sociological study.
What?
Look over there.
Okay, but--
--now there.
They're making "Blair Witch II," too.
No problem, just give us 'til dawn and we're gone.
No problem, just give us 'til dawn and we're gone.
<u>What</u>?
<u>What</u>?
Look, guys, we're cold, we're tired we're <u>shook</u>--we just want to get out of here as soon as there's light. We saw something up at Coffin Rock today--
How're the cameras doing?
Due for a re-load and battery check. I'll get on it.
--and none of 'em were mine! I-am-so-fucked, I-am-so-fucked-- where the hell was everybody???
Asleep--
Asleep--
--what happened to the goddamn "Witch-watch??"
--what happened to the goddamn "Witch-watch??"
--I dunno, I just woke up--
Cotter, I think she's right. Why would those guys go to all the trouble of stealing the camera and all this other stuff and leave the tapes?
Spite.
Spite.
They were making a movie--if they were going to steal anything it'd be <u>just</u> the tapes, to see if we had anything they didn't.
403 41st Street, kids: home.
I dunno it's safe to even get out of the car.

Let's get inside.
First enormous brick warehouse on your right.
Just one lock in this neighbor- hood?
All I need--
Running a junk yard.
A Cyber Entrepreneurialship.
There's four other angles, man, we haven't even--
--great: we can watch Domini sleep for hours--or, shit, maybe if we stay at it for a couple of days, maybe a deer'll dash by!
What--
--oh, Jesus--
--whatever you want, no problem--
--still go see the OB in the morning--
You wanna keep it down, she's trying to sleep.
Sorry, I didn't think we were making that much noise.
Sorry, I didn't think we were making that much noise.
It's not a real "funny" time for us, okay?
Well, she's got to be <u>somewhere</u> here.
No one's been in or out since you left. Would've heard the dogs.
How much of that stuff you guys been smoking?
Enough to keep sane.
Enough to keep sane.
Enough to make shapes and shadows in the dark into something else.
Chrissake: why <u>any</u> of this?
I think it's time to get out of here.
It's Domini, it's not Domini, I don't care--all I know is <u>I'm</u> not dealing with something--<u>anything</u>-- snuffing me in my sleep. I want to do what we did in the woods-- surveillance of this whole place 24/7, with somebody monitoring those cameras every second. There's something, somebody here, I want to see 'em coming.
I thought all your equipment got stolen.
I thought all your equipment got stolen.
All the shit that was worth anything, yes. You'd be amazed, though, what you can get free on the 'net.
Just hold on!
I can't!
Just let it go, I've got you!
What're you nuts--
What're you nuts--
--it's less than four feet, just--
--it's less than four feet, just--
--shit!!!
What?
One of the printers.
Why was <u>she</u> exempted, Nick?
Maybe whatever they are, they just haven't appeared yet on her?
Ruins of the Rustin Parr house.
Guy who killed all the kids in the '40s.
What is all this shit?
We're doing dusk-till-dawn taping of all the places where there've been alleged Blair Witch "sightings" --the Parr House, Coffin Rock, Tappy Creek.
We're doing dusk-till-dawn taping of all the places where there've been alleged Blair Witch "sightings" --the Parr House, Coffin Rock, Tappy Creek.
Why?
Why?
See what turns up--which I guarantee will be nothing. Some of the rest of the party are more hopeful--
She got <u>paid</u>.
I thought the movie was bitchin'.
Look at those marks--just like in the movie.
Ancient runes--
--sacred and occult Scotch Tape.
Rusty Parr had the right idea on child care.
Oooh. Oooh.
Ah, Domini?
Ah, Domini?
What?
What?
You planning on sleeping out there?
You planning on sleeping out there?
Not planning on sleeping at all.
Ripped? They look like they were <u>bit</u> off.
Smells Like Teenage Spirit.
That's almost a year's worth of work! Scumbags! Oh, Jesus, Jesus....
At least you still have the tapes.
Pointless.
No. I don't think so.
What?
Why she kills children.
Someone want to tell me what's going on--
--and we brought it back with us!
The four of you really have too much spare fucking time on your hands, don't you?
And what's your excuse for being here?
Women miscarry all the--
--no.
What's that?
Hmm? I dunno. Chafing from the backpack, something.
Hmm? I dunno. Chafing from the backpack, something.
That'd be up on your shoulder, maybe your lower back.
That'd be up on your shoulder, maybe your lower back.
Then I have no idea.
What'd you see?
Motion. Stop there. Play it again.
For a blur?
There is something <u>there</u>--don't ask, just trust me.
Cotter'll kill you.
He'll never know.
He'll never know.
Two-to-one he dusts the keyboard for fingerprints the second he gets back.
At least go drink it somewhere spilling it won't drive him to suicide.
Okay.
What is it you thought you saw on that tape?
Still working on it.
Still working on it.
Elly Kedward?
Elly Kedward?
No. Elly Kedward's not the problem here, I don't think. She was just a good old-fashioned white witch--
Dad...?
What'd you say?
Are you alright?
....I don't know.
Jesus.
What?
What?
That's the <u>reason</u>.
What?
It touched me, don't you see it now?
Slow it down, slow it down, whatever it is, we'll figure it out.
That's why she kills children.
That's why she kills children.
I know, I know--
You gonna be alright?
Sure. I'm sorry.
Sure. I'm sorry.
No big deal. I'm just trying to understand.

I think you closed the bar again. I'll have to go out.
I think you closed the bar again. I'll have to go out.
Go to the store. When you get back, I'll try to make sense of it for you.
What're you afraid's going to happen?
That they'll start touching us inside our heads.
--bullshit--
--she wasn't a witch--we embrace nature, not evil--
The good old days: toasting marsh- mallows over a burning witch.
They never burned witches in this country, they hanged them.
They never burned witches in this country, they hanged them.
Whatever--all I know is the persecution's going to start all over again, they keep pumping out inflammatory bullshit like this fucking movie--
She <u>wasn't</u> a witch.
Whatever.
Finally got her back to sleep.
Nick, what you should do is get her back up and get her to a goddamn <u>doctor</u>.
Nick, what you should do is get her back up and get her to a goddamn <u>doctor</u>.
Jesus, you don't think I know that? You don't think I've tried? She won't fucking <u>go</u>-- she won't leave this place.

Okay. Hypothetically.

Shoot.
Shoot.
You think....there could've been something up in those woods that Anna--
You think....there could've been something up in those woods that Anna--
--it's not a could've--there <u>was</u>, Nick. And it fucked up Anna, and did something to Domini, and it caused my father to die, and it's here <u>with</u> us in this place <u>now</u>. And I don't have one single idea in hell what's going to happen next, just that it's going to happen to one of us. And then the other. And then the other.
There's explanations. Rational explanations for everything that's happened. We'll drive ourselves crazy if we keep obsessing on supernatural what-ifs.
That feels good. Lower--down into my neck.
What?
I dunno it's anything. It's a name Anna's mentioned--from her dreams.
Spare me.
Hey, chemicals, fear, sleep- deprivation--and a round-the-clock obsession with the occult--hell've a recipe for a mind-fuck.
We are being fucked with here, someone or something.
Domini.
Domini.
Why in the world would <u>she</u>--
Why in the world would <u>she</u>--
--why in the world would she just fly the coop in the first place?
Domini's the only logical explanation.
We're not dealing with fucking logic here!
I can't do it!
Don't! You're making me lose my grip.
Gothic rune--the letter "S."
Or a blood blister--or a bruise.
Put 'em together that's a "k." James Kurth--

I should check on Anna.
Check the monitor, she's <u>fine</u>.

She's far from "fine."

You're needed here--keep watching--
No. We <u>all</u> go.

--fuck Anna!
"It's why the witch kills children."
I thought all witches were benign and good.
I thought all witches were benign and good.
Not this one.
What the fuck's going on here?
Does she have marks, Nick--like the ones we have, that Domini had?
Does she have marks, Nick--like the ones we have, that Domini had?
Why?
Why?
Does she, goddamnit??
Does she, goddamnit??
Not that I've seen--but that has no meaning--that means nothing.
It's <u>possible</u> for chrissake--
--the marks appear, then you disappear. Like the little Kurth boy, like Domini, as soon as they come to full bloom--and mine <u>are</u>!
Like a blueprint for disembowelment.
There are <u>other</u> explanations! She is not the goddamn witch, that's insane!
There are <u>other</u> explanations! She is not the goddamn witch, that's insane!

Listen Meurice, you're gonna help me with a problem.
I am?
You're gonna keep an eye on Marty and Ray, make sure nothing happens.
It won't?
Thanks, Meurice.
Any time. But you don't have to worry about a thing for a while. Marty went down to Corpus yesterday.
Abby. What's the matter?
I... I'm sorry, Meurice. I gotta talk to you... Can I come in?
Jesus, I got a hangover. Want a drink?
No, I--
No, I--
Well I do...

Something happened with Marty and Ray--

You got a girl--am I screwing something up by being here?
...I can find a place tomorrow, then I'll be outta your hair.
If that's what you want to do, then you oughta do it. You, uh... you want the bed or the couch?
Well... the couch would be all right...
You can sleep on the bed if you want.

Well... I'm not gonna put you out of your bed...

You wouldn't be putting me out.
You wouldn't be putting me out.
...Well, I'd be okay in here--
I could've sworn I heard something.
Door's locked. Nothing there.
I knew it. 'Cause we wouldn't have heard anything if it was him. He's real careful. Fact is, he's anal.
...Huh?
...Huh?
Yeah, he told me once himself. He said to me...
...Well I'll be damned.
I couldn't believe it either...
...He sent me to a psychiatrist to see if he could calm me down some.
Yeah? What happened?
Yeah? What happened?
Psychiatrist said I was the healthiest person he'd ever met, so Marty fired him.

I said, Marty, how come you're anal and I gotta go to the psychiatrist?
What'd he say?

I don't know. It's early... I love you.
...You all right?
I don't know. I better get off now.
Okay, see ya... Thanks, Ray.
Abby--
...Ray?
You're bad.
...What?
I said you're bad.
Why didn't you get into bed?
I didn't think I could sleep. I'm surprised you could. Are you all right?
I didn't think I could sleep. I'm surprised you could. Are you all right?
Yeah...
...You called me this morning.
Yeah.
...I just wanted to let you know that everything was all right. I took care of everything. Now all we have to do is keep our heads.
...What do you mean?
What happened?--Was Meurice there?
Yeah.
Well... what happened?
I cleaned it all up, but that ain't important...
...Anyway, we got some time now. But we gotta be smart.
Ray--
Ray--
Abby, never point a gun at anyone unless you're gonna shoot him. And when you shoot him you better make sure he's dead...
...That's the only thing they told us in the service that was worth a goddamn--Where the hell's my windbreaker?
What the hell happened, Ray?
...That's what's important.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I... I mean what're you talking about, Ray? I haven't done anything funny.
...What was that?
...Who?
Marty.
...What's going on with you two?
All right...
...Where is everything?
In the trunk.
...You leaving?
Isn't that what you want?
...But first I gotta know what happened.
What do you want to know?
What do you want to know?
You broke into the bar. You wanted to get your money. You and Marty had a fight. Something happened...
...I don't know, wasn't it you? Maybe a burglar broke in, and you found--
With your gun?...
...So?
I think someone's watching.
If he does come in I'm not here... What were you drinking, Debra?
Remy.
Remy.
You've got a very sophisticated palate.
You've got a very sophisticated palate.
Thanks.
Thanks.
Give Debra here another drink, and give me the usual.
Listen, I got tickets for the Oilers and the Rams next week in the Astrodome. Ever sat on the fifty yard line?
I don't follow baseball.
You won't have to. I'll explain what a palate is.
You won't have to. I just wanted to see if you knew.
So how long have you know Meurice?
About ten years.
...So what're you doing tonight?
Going out with Meurice.
It'll pass.
We don't seem to be communicating--
We don't seem to be communicating--
You want to hustle me. I don't want to be hustled. It's as simple as that. Now that I've communicated, why don't you leave?
You want to hustle me. I don't want to be hustled. It's as simple as that. Now that I've communicated, why don't you leave?
I own the place.

Tell him the channels, Dusty.
Tell him the channels, Dusty.
Channels, we got two and six. Two don't come in so hot.
Sure don't.
See, Wednesday's the special on RC Cola. I don't know if I explained about the TV option. If there's a TV in the room, you got to pay the option.

Well, I'm only an employee, I ain't married to him.
Well, I'm only an employee, I ain't married to him.
Yeah...
...I don't know. Sometimes I think there's something wrong with him. Like maybe he's sick? Mentally?... Or is it maybe me, do you think?
Listen, I ain't a marriage counselor. I don't know what goes on, I don't wanna know... But I like you. I always liked you...

I'm supposed to do a murder--two murders--and just trust you not to go simple on me and do something stupid. I mean real stupid. Now why should I trust you?
For the money.

Something I got to ask you, Marty. I've been very very careful. Have you been very very careful?
Of course.
Of course.
Nobody knows you hired me?
...I just made a call about that. It'll look fine.
I must've gone money simple. This kind of murder...
...it's too damn risky.
Then you shouldn't have done it. Can't have it both ways.

Is Marty here?
Not here tonight. Wasn't here last night. He's especially not back in his office.

Good to see you, Diego.

Fifteen kilos. Seven and a half in each suitcase. You receive a hundred thousand dollars upon delivery.
Okay.
Please, continue.
We make the pick-up, refuel once more in the Bahamas, and fly back on Sunday with the mom and pop traffic.
What's the matter, George?
What's the matter? We're moving three hundred fucking kilos and we're making dogshit.

And what happens when these guys stop paying? Sooner or later, these guys are going to cut us out. Then where are we?
That's my George, always thinking.
This is only part of the business, George. A very small part. Don't worry, there is so much more to do. Which reminds me, I need a favor from you. I must go to Colombia.
What is it, George? Because I have to get home. I've got a parole officer waiting for me.
What is it, George? Because I have to get home. I've got a parole officer waiting for me.

Well, you better get here fast. I'm sitting on...
Jesus Christ, George, I don't see you in two years, and you show up at my door with a hundred and ten pounds of cocaine?
Just sell it, Derek.
Thirty-six hours. I can't believe it. Everything is gone in thirty-six hours.
I think it's fair to say you underestimated the market there, Derek.
I think it's fair to say you underestimated the market there, Derek.
Touche.

But to the victor belong the spoils.
George, good to see you, my brother.
What the fuck is going on? When did you get out of jail?
What the fuck is going on? When did you get out of jail?
Pablo used his influence. Now, George, watch what you say. Everybody hears everything. A lot of things get said and done that, well, let's just say this isn't America. Life is cheap here, you know? No offense, but you know what I'm saying?

Who? I need to know. Ah, never mind. We'll talk about it later.
Yeah. You do the talking.
Three million. I counted it twice.
It's two-point-five, George. I am sure.
I'm calling it three.
We're half a million off.
We're half a million off.
Fuck it. I'm not counting it again.

Weight it. If it's sixty pounds, it's three. If it's fifty, it's two-point five.
I don't give a shit. Close enough.
Where do I put this!?
Try the back bedroom.
There's no room.
Try the closet.
Are you comfortable with this?
George, we've got sixty-one million dollars. It's either here or someplace else. We've got to put it somewhere. Unless you want to launder it.

And keep only forty-percent? No thanks.

Then relax. It's a federal bank. Guaranteed by the government. And Senor Noriega has very lenient banking principles. No questions. No problems. All the pesados keep their money here. Even El Padrino. What do you worry? Everyone knows we are with Escobar. Who is going to fuck with us?
I'm married, George. Me. I can't believe it. Can you believe I'm married, George?
You're a lucky man, Diego.
You're a lucky man, Diego.
I love you, my brother, do you know that?
I love you, my brother, do you know that?
I love you too, man.
Three years. How long have we been in business? Three years. Does she get to meet your connection? Was she good enough?
Shut up, Diego. They're going to be here any minute. I'm trying to concentrate.
Shut up, Diego. They're going to be here any minute. I'm trying to concentrate.
I'm very angry with you, George. Very angry. You don't take me to California, but you take your bitch wife? A woman? I understand you love her, but it was you and me who started this. You and me.
I'm very angry with you, George. Very angry. You don't take me to California, but you take your bitch wife? A woman? I understand you love her, but it was you and me who started this. You and me.

What do you need my connection for, Diego? What are you going to do with it?
What do I do with it? Nothing. It's for peace of mind. It's for the principle.
Jesus fucking Christ, Diego. I ain't telling you. It's just business. Now, shut up. You're driving me crazy.
I'm driving you crazy? No. You're driving me crazy. We had a dream. What happened to our dream?
Nothing. Todo esta bien.
Everything is not alright. I bring you in, and you slap my fucking face!
Everything is not alright. I bring you in, and you slap my fucking face!
This is not the time, Diego.
Take it easy! Everything's okay!
Que es lo que quieren de me, hijueputas campesinos?
Estoy bien, okay? Everything is alright. There's no problem. Okay? This never happened. No one has to know anything about this. Diego, I want you to calmly tell them where the fucking coke is. Do it now.
Es un Ford blanco junto a una pick-up.
Derek Foreal.

Derek Foreal. Derek Foreal. Derek fucking Foreal. Alright? The answer to all your dreams. Are you happy now?
George, I am happy to see you. How are you, my brother?
No more brothers, Diego.
No more brothers, Diego.
Of course we are brothers. Why do you say that? You hurt me, George.

You fucked me, Diego.

You went behind my back and you cut me out.
You went behind my back and you cut me out.
No, I never. I would not do that, George. Never.
No, I never. I would not do that, George. Never.
I talked to Foreal, Diego.
You'd better kill me now, Diego, because you're a dead man.
George, don't be so emotional. This is business. Besides, I can't kill you, you are my brother.
He's in tachycardia. George, your heart is racing. Have you been using drugs?
Coke.
Coke.
Cocaine? How much?
Cocaine? How much?
I don't know. Maybe eighteen grams.

Oh, Jesus, Get me a 12-lead e.k.g. and start an i.v. stat! This man is having a heart attack.
Well, you know. It's um...
Oh, shut up, Fred. Shut your big fat mouth. You don't buy it all at once. It's called layaway.
Yeah, layaway.

Surprised to see me?
Take your boots off. You're tan.

Thank you. Have you been getting the money I sent you?
Thank you. Have you been getting the money I sent you?
You mean the drug money? Yes, I got it.
G-d, son.
Okay, Mom. It's okay. Where's Dad?

Oh, I see.
Tell him I don't want to see him. Tell him he's not welcome here.
Mom.

I'm just happy that George has found someone he cares for.
I'm just happy that George has found someone he cares for.
Yes. Of course. But, I'm talking about that ring. It's something else. Let me tell you.
Layaway shmayaway.
That's right. Layaway. Something you wouldn't know anything about, you cheapskate.
That's right. Layaway. Something you wouldn't know anything about, you cheapskate.
Who's the cheapskate?
Who's the cheapskate?
You, you big old tightwad. He still has his communion money. Tell him, George. Tell your father about layaway.
Yeah. Nice.
Look at this credenza. If you don't mind me asking, how much is something like that? It's got to cost a fortune.
So, this is the man who takes fifty kilos and makes them disappear in one day?
Actually, it was three.
Actually, it was three.
The man who gives us the airplanes. The man from America. The mafia. Chicago. Boom boom. Hollywood. You are going to open for us the gates of Hollywood, George?

It would be my pleasure.
It would be my pleasure.
Good. Very good. Welcome, my friend. Welcome to my country.
The man in the garden. He was full of courage.
Un sapo?
Un sapo?
Un rata - no good. But he could have run, fled the country. Gone to the policia. But then his wife, his children, his parents, his friends, many people would die.
Un rata - no good. But he could have run, fled the country. Gone to the policia. But then his wife, his children, his parents, his friends, many people would die.
Yes.
Yes.
But, never mind. I am thinking we can do much together. This problem with Diego, the stolen car, the jail, is very silly business. To release him from the carcel, it causes me much inconvenience. The fifty kilos could have been a big problem. And I don't like problems.

With all respect, Padrino. Diego is my partner. I do not do business without him.
I like you, George. You are loyal. That is good. That is rare. Maybe crazy. Yes. I can tell already. You are like me. I look at you and I see myself. It's in the eyes, no, George?
Yes, it is.
Yes, it is.
So, you are wanting to sell the cocaine for me in your country, George?
So, you are wanting to sell the cocaine for me in your country, George?
Yes, sir. As much as you can give me.
Yes, sir. As much as you can give me.
As much as I can give you? Ha ha. Very good. I like that. Come, George. Let us drive. We have much to talk about.
I like to come up here. To make the decisions. To be one with nature.
It's beautiful.
It's beautiful.
People tell me that I am crazy. That my business will never work in your country. What do you think, George?
What do I think? I don't want my answer to be influenced by what I want, so I'm going to have to say I don't know.
Yes. I do not know, either. What do you want, George?
Yes. I do not know, either. What do you want, George?
I want money.

Yes. Money. Which is what, George?

I see. I'm sorry about this, George. I'm not happy about this situation. It's bad. You now know who your Brutus is.
You know why I'm here. You know what I have to do. I came here for permission. Out of respect, Pablo. This is bullshit, he's making me look like a punk.

It is very difficult. Diego makes me a lot of money. If Diego goes so does the money. You were an excellent teacher, George. When the student has learned well, the teacher is no longer necessary. We must remember we have wives, friends, familia. Even familia that has not been born. But sometimes, we must forget as well. I am like you. I must

Yeah, well, what are you gonna do? You and me, Pablo? Are we good?
Of course, George. We are beautiful. We are brothers. Real brothers. Not like Diego. We started this, George.

Let me tell you something, son. You would have been great at anything.
So, business is going good. I've got this import/export thing going on in Miami that's been very profitable. With my investments...
Don't bullshit me, George. I don't see you very much, I don't want to waste the time.
You're like your mother. You love money.
Dad.
Dad.
No, it's good. You have a family. It's good if it makes you happy. It's nice to have nice things. Are you happy, son?

And that FBI agent, Trout? When he had to get on his knees to put my boots on? You said...
That's where you belong...
...you sonofabitch. Putting on George's boots.
That was a good one, Dad. That was really something. Remember that?
I guess I kind of lost sight of things. "May the wind always be at your back and the sun always upon your face, and the winds of destiny carry you aloft to dance with the stars." Love, George.
That was a beautiful message.
That was a beautiful message.

You hear about your old friend, Diego?

What about him?
What the fuck? Is he going to walk?
He's going down, George. It's election year. We're not making any deals.
Don't be stupid, George. We've got him. We've got him dead to rights. But like I said, this is top priority so we're handing out free passes on this one. And the first one's got your name on it. Cut your sentence in half, maybe more.
No thanks, fellas. You've got the wrong fucking guy. I'm not a rat.

We sell it. I got it all figured out. We make three finger lids and sell them on the beach. We move all of it. We've made ourselves a hundred bucks. Or a lot of weed for our head. What do you think? Not bad, huh? I got the baggies and everything.

Hey, look. You start paying, who knows what will happen. You're a good father, George. I always gave you that. But you've got to talk to her.
Yeah.
Yeah.
She's getting big. Getting her own ideas.
She's getting big. Getting her own ideas.
I know. Well, that's all I really wanted to say. So, okay, then.
Hey, George. You okay?
Yeah. I'm fine. I'm good.
Mirtha, what's going on? Everything okay with Kristina?
Kristina's fine.
Kristina's fine.
Is she here? Is she coming?
Is she here? Is she coming?
Is she here? George, Kristina hates you. You fucked her over one too many times. And I'm not here to socialize. Did you hear about Diego?
Is she here? George, Kristina hates you. You fucked her over one too many times. And I'm not here to socialize. Did you hear about Diego?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, I got a call from Pablo. He said this thing with Diego is a disaster. He's giving up lab locations, names, bank accounts, he was very pissed off. Pablo said to take him down. His exact words were "Fuck Diego."
Well, I got a call from Pablo. He said this thing with Diego is a disaster. He's giving up lab locations, names, bank accounts, he was very pissed off. Pablo said to take him down. His exact words were "Fuck Diego."
He wants me to testify? Is that what he's asking me to do?
He wants me to testify? Is that what he's asking me to do?
George, he wasn't asking.
Mirtha, how are you doing?
Better than you.
Everything's gonna be okay, sweetheart. Don't be upset.
What's happening to us?
I don't know.
Are we gonna split up?
Are we gonna split up?
No, never. Don't even think about that, it's impossible. I love your mother. And you are my heart. Could I live without my heart? Could I?
What are you doing here?
Nothing. I just wanted you to know I was out. I just wanted to see you.
Nothing. I just wanted you to know I was out. I just wanted to see you.
Well, here I am. See?
Well, here I am. See?
How are you doing?
How are you doing?
George, you just can't show up, tell me you love me, and have everything be okay.
George, you just can't show up, tell me you love me, and have everything be okay.
Dad.
Dad.
What?
What?
You can call me Dad if you want.
You can call me Dad if you want.
I don't want, alright? It's not funny. I'm really pissed off, George. You blew it, now leave me alone.
I don't want, alright? It's not funny. I'm really pissed off, George. You blew it, now leave me alone.
Kristina, c'mon, I'm sorry. I'm going to make this right. I've got a few things going on...
Kristina, c'mon, I'm sorry. I'm going to make this right. I've got a few things going on...
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?
Just to walk with you. I want to be your dad again.
Just to walk with you. I want to be your dad again.
Do what you want, it's a free country.
Let me ask you something. If you could go anywhere in the world, anywhere, where would you want to go?
You mean, like a trip?
You mean, like a trip?
Yeah, sure, whatever.
California? You can go anywhere in the world. India. Tibet. Australia. Paris. And you choose California?
Yeah.
Yeah.
What is it? A Disneyland thing?
What is it? A Disneyland thing?
No. I just kind of like the sound of it.
No. I just kind of like the sound of it.
California, huh?
California, huh?
California.
Bye, Dad. See you in the morning, okay?
I'll be here.
I'm thinking about getting out of town this week. You want to come with me?
Where are you going?
Where are you going?
I don't know. Maybe California.
I don't know. Maybe California.
You swear?
You swear?
Yeah. Go out there, check it out, see what it's like. I've got some stuff to do this week, but I'm thinking maybe Thursday. Thursday after school.
Yeah. Go out there, check it out, see what it's like. I've got some stuff to do this week, but I'm thinking maybe Thursday. Thursday after school.
You know I can't. Mom will never let me go.
You know I can't. Mom will never let me go.
You let me take care of your mother. You just pack your bags.
You let me take care of your mother. You just pack your bags.
But I've got school.
But I've got school.
There's schools in California.
There's schools in California.
You swear?
You swear?
That's right. Three o'clock. Thursday. At your mother's. You and me. It's a date.
That's right. Three o'clock. Thursday. At your mother's. You and me. It's a date.
I don't believe you.
I don't believe you.
I swear. On my life.

Swear on my life.
Swear on my life.
I swear on your life.
I'm sorry, baby. I'm so sorry.
It's alright, Dad.
It's alright, Dad.
I didn't mean to...
I didn't mean to...
I know, Dad. I know...
I fucked up.
Shhhh.
Shhhh.
I love you. I love you so much. You've got to know that. You've got to know.
I love you. I love you so much. You've got to know that. You've got to know.
I know, Dad. I love you too.
I know, Dad. I love you too.
After everything. After everything, the only thing left out of my whole life is you.
But I have a visitor.
Not today, George. Time to go back.
Not today, George. Time to go back.
But I want to put her name on the list for tomorrow. My daughter.
But I want to put her name on the list for tomorrow. My daughter.
Okay, George.
Okay, George.
Because she's visiting me.
Because she's visiting me.
We'll do that tomorrow, okay? It's lockdown time.
Mr. Jung, do you know Diego Delgado?
Yes, I do.
Yes, I do.
Do you see him here in the courtroom?
Do you see him here in the courtroom?
Yes, he's sitting right there at the end of the table.
Yes, he's sitting right there at the end of the table.
Let the record state the witness has identified, Diego Delgado.
Mr. Jung, can you describe the circumstances of how you began talking about cocaine with Mr. Delgado?
Shortly after I arrived at Danbury Federal Correctional Institute I related to Diego that the crime I was in for was smuggling marijuana. Diego told me he had high level connections in Colombia and they needed to find someone to help them transport cocaine into America...
It's a four-man operation. Two on the ground. Two in the air.
Who's the co-pilot?
Who's the co-pilot?
You're looking at him. We provide the plane, transportation cost, U.S. landing spot, and take it to wherever you want it to go. You provide the pick up point in South America, and are responsible for payment. You assume all the bust risks. We take sixty-five percent of all transportation fees, ten percent of the gross, plus our expenses. This is not a negotiation,

Sounds fine. I'll need to meet everybody.
Sounds fine. I'll need to meet everybody.
They're over at the booth.
You saved my life, Dulli. You'll never fucking know. All you guys. Everyone just got a raise. Instead of ten percent, you get fifteen.
Jesus, George, fifteen percent. That's an extra two-hundred large.
Jesus, George, fifteen percent. That's an extra two-hundred large.
I don't give a shit. Split it up. Have a great life. I'm done. I'm out. Starting over. Cheers.
Ramon tells me you are looking for some mota.
Yes, I am.
For instance, something like this?
Very nice. I'll take it.
Very nice. I'll take it.
Ha ha ha. You are funny. Really, how much will you be needing?
Ha ha ha. You are funny. Really, how much will you be needing?
All of it. As much as you've got. A couples thousand pounds. I'll be back in a week with a plane.
All of it. As much as you've got. A couples thousand pounds. I'll be back in a week with a plane.
Listen, Americano, it is very nice to meet you, but maybe we are going too fast. You take a little and then come back.

Marijuana is illegal in my country, and I believe in yours, as well. We must be careful.

What if I brought you, let's say, fifty thousand dollars? Would that eliminate some of your concerns?
What if I brought you, let's say, fifty thousand dollars? Would that eliminate some of your concerns?
Amigo, you bring me fifty-thousand dollars, and I have no more concerns.
Good to see you, Jorge. You are a man of your word.
Actually, I've got some news. That fifty thousand I promised you, I couldn't get it.
Well, I'll tell you. I was walking down the beach, minding my business, when who did I see but this fucking guy. I didn't know you guys were living in California.
Yeah, but what are you doing out here?
Yeah, but what are you doing out here?
I'm on vacation. On my way back to school.
I'm on vacation. On my way back to school.
This calls for a joint. You want to do the honors?
This calls for a joint. You want to do the honors?
No, man. I'm too fucked up.
Right on.
G-d, I'm stoned. I'm stoned. I'm really...
G-d, I'm stoned. I'm stoned. I'm really...
Stoned?
Stoned?
I wish there was shit like this back home.
I wish there was shit like this back home.
Yeah?
Yeah?
Shit, yeah. Do you know how much money I could make if I had this stuff back east?
Yeah?
When there's something to move, it's too easy not to. Do you know how many colleges are in a twenty mile radius? U. Mass, Amherst, B.U....
It's not enough.
What?
So?
So, we need to get to the source.
Okay. So we need a source. Where do we start?
Who speaks Spanish?
Not that far, only halfway. You sure you know what you're doing?
Relax. I've flown with my old man a million times. And he always told me, the taking off part is easy, it's the landing you've got to worry about.
Holy shit, Dulli!
Georgie, oh man, hold the mayo!
Georgie, oh man, hold the mayo!
That was it. Seeing Dulli after fourteen years sealed the deal for me. The rest was just details. My end was roughly five-hundred thousand. Kristina and I could have a good life for five hundred grand. Start over somewhere. One final score. That's all I needed.
Are we good?
Are we good? Yeah, we're good. We're beautiful. We're perfect. This is A grade, one-hundred percent pure Colombian cocaine, Ladies and Gentlemen. Disco shit. Pure as the driven snow. Good riddance.
Nice weed, huh?
Fuck yeah. I never seen nothing like it. I'm fucking wasted.
No shit, Kevin?
That's right.
Smith. Hampshire....
Right. And Holyoke. There are a hundred thousand rich kids with their parents' money to spend, but there's never anything available. Nothing good, anyway. I'm paying four hundred dollars for shit.
Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, nine. Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, a thousand. It's all there. Wow. A hundred and twenty-eight thousand dollars.
Jesus Christ, I'm getting a boner just looking at it.
What's the matter, George? Something wrong? You look like you just fucked your mother.
Cheer up, man. Half this money is ours. We're fucking rich.
This is bullshit, George. We're never going to find anything down there.
You know, he's got a point. We're fucking Americans. We stick out like sore thumbs.
I can't believe we're stealing a plane.
Don't be such a pussy.
Look around. I've put everything at your disposal. Go take a look with your own eyes.
The strike is a success; but ...
The strike is a success; but ...
No. It has failed in its objective.
But the NLF has always spoken of a strike as a demonstration ...
And you believe the NLF?
And you believe the NLF?
They seemed to be plausible this time. A general strike is a good argument for the UN.

The UN is far away, dear sir. It is easier to make oneself heard with bombs. If I were in their place, I would use bombs.
Colonel Mathieu ... Much has been said lately not only of the successes obtained by the paratroopers, but also of the methods that they have employed ... Can you tell us something about this?
The successes obtained are the results of those methods. One presupposes the other and vice versa.
It is an inevitable stage in revolutionary war; from terrorism, one passes to insurrection ... as from open guerrilla warfare one passes to real war, the latter being the determining factor ...
Dien Bien Phu?
Dien Bien Phu?
Exactly.
In Indochina, <U>they</U> won.
And here?
And here?
It depends on you.
Excuse me, colonel. I have the impression that perhaps due to excessive prudence ... my colleagues continue to ask the same allusive questions, to which you can only respond in an allusive manner. I think it would be better to call things by their right names; if one means torture, then one should call it torture.
I understand. What's your question?
I understand. What's your question?
The questions have already been asked. I would only like some precise answers, that's all ...
The questions have already been asked. I would only like some precise answers, that's all ...
Let's try to be precise then. The word "torture" does not appear in our orders. We have always spoken of interrogation as the only valid method in a police operation directed against unknown enemies. As for the NLF, they request that their members, in the event of capture, should maintain silence for twenty-four hours, and then, they may talk. Thus, the organization has already

And those who explode bombs in public places, do they perhaps respect the law? When you asked that question to Ben M'Hidi, remember what he said? No, gentlemen, believe me, it is a vicious circle. And we could discuss the problem for hours without reaching any conclusions. Because the problem does not lie here. The problem is: the NLF wants us to leave Algeria

Uh ... responsible for the sixth section.
You afraid of these ...?
Don't move, Hacene.
Don't move, Hacene.
Why are you afraid? We've always been friends. One might even say that I brought you up ... Isn't it true, Ali?

It's true.
It's true.
What's happened to you?
What's happened to you?
The NLF has condemned you to death.
How much are they paying you?
They're not paying me anything. They've already warned you twice; this is the last warning. Decide.

What ... What must I decide?
What ... What must I decide?
You've got to change occupations, Hacene. Right away!
With an unloaded pistol?
I'll explain.
Let's suppose you were a spy. In prison, when the NLF contacts you, you pretend to support the revolution, and then the French help you to escape ...
Sure. By shooting at me.
Sure. By shooting at me.
Even that could be a trick. You escape, then show up at the address which the brothers in prison gave to you, and so you are able to contact me ...

I don't even know your name yet ...
I don't even know your name yet ...
My name is Kader, Ali ... Saari Kader ... In other words, in order to join the organization, you had to undergo a test. I could have told you to murder the barman, but he's an Algerian ... and the police would let you kill him, even though he is one of theirs. By obeying such an order, you still could have been a
But I haven't shot him.
You weren't able to. But what's important is that you tried.
You weren't able to. But what's important is that you tried.

Then don't complain.

You still haven't told me why you didn't let me kill him.
You still haven't told me why you didn't let me kill him.
Because we aren't ready yet for the French. Before attacking, we must have safe places from which to depart and find refuge. Of course, there is the Casbah. But even the Casbah isn't safe yet. There are too many drunks, pushers, whores, addicts, spies ... people who talk too much ... people who are ready to sell themselves, undecided people. We must either convince
And how many are we?
Not enough.
Why? Isn't he sleeping here?
No, it's better if he doesn't. The house is filled with new people.
It's better to split up, to increase our chances. We must change hiding places, and change them continually ... In the meantime, we must make new contacts, replace our arrested brothers, reorganize our sections--
Yes, but we must also show them that we still exist.
Yes, but we must also show them that we still exist.
Of course. As soon as possible.
Of course. As soon as possible.
No, immediately. The people are demoralized. Leave this to me ...
No, immediately. The people are demoralized. Leave this to me ...
No. Not you, or any one of us. As long as we are free, the NLF continues to exist in the Casbah. If they manage to take us too, there won't be anything left ... And from nothing comes nothing ...
Go away!
Men have two faces: one that laughs and one that cries ...
Can you read?
Sure ...
Read it.
Here?
Where's Kader?
With the others. They are trying to stop the people.
With the others. They are trying to stop the people.
Go away.
Be careful now. Unless you know how it works, it's better if you sit on the plank and move forward like this ...
Let's try ...
It's good nobody is following us ...
It's a question of habit ...
What do you think of the strike, Ali?
I think it'll be a success ...
I think it'll be a success ...
Yes, I think so too ... It's been organized well ... But what will the French do?
It's clear. They'll do everything possible to make it fail.
No, they'll do even more. We've given them the opportunity to do a lot more ... Do you understand what I mean? Starting tomorrow, they won't be groping in the dark any more; every shop and every worker who strikes will be a known enemy, a self-confessed criminal ... And they will be able to pass to the offensive. Have you thought of this?
No ...
But Kader told me that you weren't in favor of the strike.
But Kader told me that you weren't in favor of the strike.
No, and neither were my men.
No, and neither were my men.
Why?
Why?
Because they told us that we mustn't use weapons, now, when the time is right.
Because they told us that we mustn't use weapons, now, when the time is right.
That's true ... Wars aren't won with terrorism, neither wars nor revolutions. Terrorism is a beginning but afterward, all the people must act ... This is the reason for the strike, and its necessity: to mobilize all Algerians, count them and measure their strength ...

To show them to the UN, right?
To show them to the UN, right?
Yes ... yes. The problem also involves the UN. I don't know what it's worth, but this way, we'll give the UN the possibility of evaluating our strength.
Good evening ... Can we pass?
It's too late. No one is allowed to enter the Casbah at this hour. It's impossible.

Where were we?
Intersection, between Consular Street and General Laquiere Avenue ...

Good evening, sir.
Mathieu! Mathieu, a name ...
A name?
A name?
Yes, a name for the operation.
And so the tapeworm no longer has a head. Are you satisfied, Mathieu? In Algiers everything should be over.
Yes, I believe there won't be any more talk of the NLF for some time.
Yes, I believe there won't be any more talk of the NLF for some time.
Let's hope forever.
Bah, for that matter, Algeria isn't the only country in the world ...
Why, yes, of course ... But for the moment, let's be satisfied with Algiers! In the mountains our work is always easier.
Why?
For many months, I've had your photo on my desk together with a dozen or so reports on you ... And naturally, I am under the illusion that I know you somewhat. You never seemed the type, Kader, inclined to performing useless actions.
You seem to be very satisfied to have taken me alive ...
Of course I am.
Of course I am.
That proves that I was wrong. Evidently I credited you with an advantage greater than I should have.
That proves that I was wrong. Evidently I credited you with an advantage greater than I should have.
No. Let's just say that you've given me the satisfaction to have guessed correctly. But from the technical point of view, it isn't possible to speak of advantages. By now the game is over. The NLF has been defeated.
What is she saying?
She says that Ali is still in the Casbah.
Who is speaking?
Mathieu. Colonel Mathieu.
Mathieu. Colonel Mathieu.
We don't trust you, colonel. Come forward, show yourself.
Okay. But we want your promise for a fair trial in writing. Give us a written statement, Mathieu, and then we'll surrender.
How can I give you this statement?
How can I give you this statement?
We'll lower a basket from the window ...
We'll lower a basket from the window ...
Okay, I'll make the statement in writing ...
Are you ready, colonel?
Yes ... But let me first see you.
How you doin' Mister D?
Fine, Charlie. You familiar with the Marsh case?
Yeah -- I hear they had 'em a real dog and pony show going on up there - - I'll tell you, sometimes white people are a real puzzle to me. I mean, did this old guy really think he was gonna be able to keep up with a sweet little number like that?
It could've happened to anyone.
It could've happened to anyone.
I'm sorry, man -- but I ain't ever heard of no brother dying from gettin' too much pussy.
We have to find out who else would profit from Marsh's death -- and who knew enough about his personal life to know that putting cocaine in the nasal spray would be fatal.
So -- where do we start?
So -- where do we start?
I want you to hit all the dealers in town. Give them a list of people close to Marsh and see if any of them use. Then I want you to check out a Doctor Alan Paley. He lives up in Roseburg.
Before you ask there's nothing new on the coke.
You've got to get me something I can use, Charlie.
You've got to get me something I can use, Charlie.
I'm trying.
I've been waiting for you to get back.
You got something on the coke?
You got something on the coke?
No -- but I got something.
I would have missed it -- but the phone rang and I let it play while I talked. It looks like blank tape -- but it isn't. It's been erased without any input signal coming in.
So, what good is it to us if it's been erased?
So, what good is it to us if it's been erased?
It's very good -- because when the D.A's office saw it they assumed it was the end of the tape, otherwise they would have buried it.
It's very good -- because when the D.A's office saw it they assumed it was the end of the tape, otherwise they would have buried it.
Why?
Why?
Because it hasn't all been erased.
I'm sorry to barge in -- but I figured after that bombshell that got laid on you today you could use some good news?
You got something on the Coke?
Charlie -- are you going to make a point soon?
Right now. Guess who's been buying Coke from him for the last five and half years?
Joanne Braslow is getting more and more interesting. I followed her today to an attorney's office. Joseph Koehler.
Joe Koehler. I know him. He's an estate attorney -- and he's very expensive.
Joe Koehler. I know him. He's an estate attorney -- and he's very expensive.
What would Joanne Braslow need with an estate attorney? She wasn't even mentioned in Marsh's will.
Here it is! According to the old will Joanne Braslow was to inherit two hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
What good does that do -- it's the old will?
What good does that do -- it's the old will?
Under the law a person cannot profit from their own wrong doing. Since Rebecca Lawson is the sole beneficiary of the new will, if she is found guilty the will is void and Joanne Braslow could make a very good case to have the old will reinstated.

She kills the old man and makes it look like Miss Lawson did it. Pretty slick.
Take some time off.
You think the D.A.'s gonna file on Joanne?
You think the D.A.'s gonna file on Joanne?
I don't know.
You did a good job, Charlie.
Thanks, Mister D.
I don't think that this is the time, or the place.
I just wanted to introduce myself and inform Miss Lawson that there will be an inquiry.
I just wanted to introduce myself and inform Miss Lawson that there will be an inquiry.
An inquiry into what?
An inquiry into what?
For starters I'd like to know why she left the house and didn't report the death?
For starters I'd like to know why she left the house and didn't report the death?
Because he wasn't dead when she left, and even if he was, not reporting a natural death in a timely fashion isn't a crime.
Because he wasn't dead when she left, and even if he was, not reporting a natural death in a timely fashion isn't a crime.
Did I say it was a natural death?
Marsh's Cardiologist told me that after Marsh was diagnosed with heart disease he quit smoking, quit drinking and started exercising every day. Does that sound like a guy who'd start shoveling cocaine up his nose?
What did he say about Miss Lawson?
What did he say about Miss Lawson?
He can remember at least one occasion -- and the receptionist can recall two times when she accompanied Marsh to the office.
So she knew about his heart?
Had to. I also interviewed three women who were in past relationships with Marsh. There's no evidence that he had anything but straight sex prior to meeting Miss Lawson.
Had to. I also interviewed three women who were in past relationships with Marsh. There's no evidence that he had anything but straight sex prior to meeting Miss Lawson.
What about the will?
What about the will?
That's the best part. She gets it all -- everything.
I think I'm going to make your day.
How?
Yeah.
Then you can go.
About three hours.
Cause?
Cause?
Not sure. I'll have everything you need tomorrow.
Marsh wasn't alone. We found traces of sperm on the sheets. The toxicology report says there were high levels of cocaine in his blood.
What'd he die of?

The official cause of death was a cardiac arrest.

That's what my report will read.
That's what my report will read.
But there's more?
What are you saying, Henry? That his girlfriend fucked him to death?
Yes.
What can we prove?
We know Marsh had a head cold. We found cocaine mixed with water in a nasal spray container on the nightstand. The coke would contract the nasal membrane the same as any decongestant, but for a much shorter time. He'd keep using more and more -- never knowing what he was taking.

Any prints on the nasal spray?
Cocaine is the last thing a man in his condition would want.
Can we put Rebecca Lawson at the scene?
Doctor McCurdy, what was the cause of death?
A massive cardiac arrest.

What was Mr. Marsh's physical condition prior to his death?

So, Mr. Marsh used cocaine?

I don't think so. The membrane in his nasal passage didn't show any sign of long time usage.
I don't think so. The membrane in his nasal passage didn't show any sign of long time usage.
Then how did it get into his body?
Then how did it get into his body?
We found a bottle of Dristan nasal spray on the nightstand. It was filled with water and cocaine. Mr. Marsh had a head cold at the time of his death. I believe he wasn't aware that he was ingesting cocaine.
Is this the bottle that was found on the nightstand?
Yes.
Yes.
Your Honor, the State enters this evidence as exhibit A. Were any fingerprints found on the bottle?

Dr. McCurdy, what would cocaine do to someone in Mr. Marsh's condition?

Increase his heart rate.

What would be the effect if someone secretly administered cocaine to Mr. Marsh and then induced him to make love?

Thank you, Doctor McCurdy. Your witness.
Mrs. Crawford, you were Mr. Marsh's maid for nine years?
Yes.
Yes.
Did Miss Lawson and Mr. Marsh ever argue?
Did Miss Lawson and Mr. Marsh ever argue?
Like cats and dogs.
Like cats and dogs.
What did they argue about?

You name it -- they argued about it. Mr. Marsh tried his best to keep her happy -- but it seemed that no matter what he did it was never enough for her.

Well -- he died on a Sunday and I have the weekends off -- but they were ripping at each other with both barrels Friday afternoon.

Sex.

Could you be more specific?
Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use cocaine?
No -- never.
No -- never.
Your witness.
Your Honor, Mr. Roston is an ex-lover of Miss Lawson's.
Why didn't the State's investigation uncover Mr. Roston earlier?

He was away on an extended vacation and just returned two days ago.
He was away on an extended vacation and just returned two days ago.
Alright -- I'm going to allow his testimony.
Objection sustained.
Did Miss Lawson ever give you any indication why she was leaving?
No questions.
You may call your next witness.
Objection, Your Honor.
Counsel approach the bench.
That's it. My client doesn't have to take this crap from you.
Sit down, Frank.
Sit down, Frank.
No. Miss Lawson came in here voluntarily to answer your questions. She doesn't have to sit here and be insulted. So, either you charge her now or we're leaving.
Lookin' to make the papers, John?
Marsh left her close to three million dollars in his will. That's motive. She admits to being there the night of his death. That's opportunity -- and her fingerprints are on the nasal spray bottle.

You can't show intent.
Can you?
Take your pole out of the water, Frank. The fish ain't biting today.
Take your pole out of the water, Frank. The fish ain't biting today.
You're bluffing. John, it's me, remember? I've known you since your name was Juan Carlos.
C'mon -- think about it. If she was going to kill Marsh why leave the nasal spray bottle there for the police to find?
She planned this. She wanted us to find the nasal spray.
She planned this. She wanted us to find the nasal spray.
Why would she want that?
Why would she want that?
Because she's clever. Because she knows that even if we didn't find it we'd have suspicions as to why a man in Marsh's condition would use cocaine.

Suspicions maybe -- but suspicions aren't enough for a conviction.
Suspicions maybe -- but suspicions aren't enough for a conviction.
The M.E.'s report stated that Marsh's nasal membranes showed no sign of prior cocaine use. Without the nasal spray we would have still treated it as a poisoning. We would have looked for motive and the trail would have still led back to her.

I don't buy it and neither will a jury.

We're going all the way on this one, Frank. Tell your client she has until the prelim to cop a plea for murder two -- fifteen to twenty five.

I'll tell her but she won't take it.
I'll tell her but she won't take it.
Then she's not as smart as I thought she was. You've seen her in the depositions. Tell me you don't have any doubts?
She's innocent.
Aren't they all?
Aren't they all?
Yeah. Well -- we'll let the blindfolded lady with the scales decide that.
Your Honor, this is a tape from Miss Lawson's answering machine. I would like to play it now.
Objection. Your Honor, we don't know where this tape is from. Who made it -- or under what circumstances it was made.
Your Honor, I fail to see what Mrs Crawford's educational background has to do with this case.
I was just about to make my point, Your Honor.
Objection, Your Honor. The fact that Mrs. Crawford heard Mr. Troxell reconstruct her sentence and decided to rephrase her words in a more intelligent manner for the court doesn't mean the incident never happened.
I'm just curious to see if Mr. Troxell reconstructed anything else.

I've got work to do.
Hey -- the bell's sounded. It's between rounds.
Hey -- the bell's sounded. It's between rounds.
I didn't hear it.
What's happening to you, Frank? You're acting like you're on trial here. This has become personal to you.
Back off, John.
That's ridiculous.
I'm talking to you as a friend now. Don't ruin your life, your career for her. She'll spit you out when this is over.

You've been following me?

Her. It's an obvious move. I'm building a case against her, remember?
Your Honor, I don't see a Mr. Roston listed as a prosecution witness.
The State's investigation just uncovered Mr. Roston yesterday afternoon in Chicago.
Objection. The question calls for a conclusion on the part of the witness.
Your Honor, Mr. Roston lived with the defendant for many months. I feel that his opinion is valid in substantiating the character of the Miss Lawson.
Your Honor, Mr. Roston lived with the defendant for many months. I feel that his opinion is valid in substantiating the character of the Miss Lawson.
The opinion of a scorned lover is hardly an objective view.
Objection!
I'll rephrase the question. Mr. Roston isn't it true you are bisexual?

Objection! Mr. Roston's sexual preferences are not at issue in this trial.
Objection! Mr. Roston's sexual preferences are not at issue in this trial.
Your Honor, I'm trying to establish the sense of betrayal Miss Lawson felt when she discovered the man she lived with was a different person than she thought he was.
Objection! May I remind Mr. Dulaney that the person on trial here is Miss Lawson -- not Dr. Paley.
Your Honor, I'm trying to establish a pattern in Dr. Paley's behavior with women.
Can I go?
You get his statement?
Miss Lawson, do you use cocaine?
I have.
I have.
Did you use it the night Marsh died?
Did you use it the night Marsh died?
No. I haven't done it in years.
Were you aware of Mr. Marsh's heart condition?
No.
No.
Mr. Marsh's Cardiologist and his nurse have told us that you accompanied Mr. Marsh to their office on at least two occasions.

That's correct -- but Andrew never told me he had a heart condition. He said he had a heart arrhythmia and it was nothing serious.

Why do you think she left you?

Well -- I think that after the operation she realized that...
When you say your sexual relations with Miss Lawson were intense what exactly do you mean?
It was like she was trying to push me as far as she could. She called it opening new doors.
It was like she was trying to push me as far as she could. She called it opening new doors.
Can you give the court an example?
Can you give the court an example?
It was like sex was a game to her. She got off on the control. She always used to tell me it had to be her way.
It's hard to resist a woman as beautiful as she is.
What would she do that made it hard to resist?
What would she do that made it hard to resist?
She's a woman who is very much aware of her own sexuality. Sometimes I felt she could read my mind. It was uncanny how she knew exactly what I wanted. A few nights before my heart surgery Rebecca woke me. She had handcuffed me to the bed.
She told me that tonight we were going to open new doors. I asked her to stop -- to take off the handcuffs, but she wouldn't listen.
What did she say?
Mr. Roston I know this is difficult for you, but it's important you tell the court what she did.
She said she was going to fuck me like I've never been fucked before.
What did she do next, Mr. Roston?
She started touching herself and telling me how much she wanted me. She reached down and put me inside her. My doctor had warned me about exerting myself -- but you really don't think of those things at a moment like that. You just think about how beautiful this woman is -- how much you want her. How deeply you want to please her.

We stopped seeing each other.
We stopped seeing each other.
Why?
Why?
Well -- I realized that she wasn't interested in me. She was just trying to get information out of me.
What kind of information?
She said that she was working on a novel and she wanted to know what kinds of drugs would be harmful to someone with a bad heart.
Did you suggest any?
Yes -- Insulin and others.
Yes -- Insulin and others.
What did she say?
What did she say?
She said that those weren't any good -- because their use would be detected and the police would know the victim had been poisoned. She wanted to know if there was a drug that would induce a heart attack but could also be used to enhance a sexual high.

Dr. Paley, where were you the last time you saw Miss Lawson?
We had dinner at a restaurant.
Isn't it true that later that night you tried to force yourself on Miss Lawson in the parking lot?
No.
No.
You didn't grab her and try to kiss her?
You didn't grab her and try to kiss her?
No.

If necessary I can bring in the valet parking attendant and two customers who witnessed the occurrence.

I suggest it never happened.
You can suggest anything you want. It happened.
No further questions.
I may have been infatuated with her - - but I wouldn't perjure myself.
That's all Dr. Paley.
Don't you see what she's doing? She needs you to kill me. She's planned it that way from the start. That's why she phoned me tonight.
You called him?
I'm sure that every orgasm she had with me was faked.
That's enough.
That's enough.
I mean she only screwed me two or three times a night because she had to -- I'm sure she didn't enjoy it.

I realized he wasn't serious. He was seeing other women -- asking other nurses at the hospital out, so I ended it.
-- And what did Dr. Paley do after you stopped seeing him?
He used to call me -- tell me that I couldn't just walk out on him. He said that if I didn't come back he'd make my life miserable.

There was an inquiry. It was his word against mine. They believed him. I was fired.
I worked for Mr. Marsh for six years. He was a good man -- until she came along.
What changed?
What changed?
He did. Look, I know you can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink -- but you hold a pail of water in front of an old horse for long enough -- and well...
You don't really believe what the district attorney is saying about Miss Lawson, do you?
I don't know. It's incredible to think that anyone could be capable of doing that -- but if anyone could it would be Rebecca.

I take it you don't like Miss Lawson very much?

Andrew was a kind and gentle man, but he was thirty years older than her. Where's the attraction to sleep with someone like that -- to have the kind of sex they had.
How do you know what kind of sex they had?
I wasn't lookin' through the keyhole if that's what you're thinking. I'd come to house sometimes to pick up papers or speak to Andrew. I'd find their little toys all over the place.

He said that if it kept up she was going to kill him. That his heart couldn't take it.
He said that if it kept up she was going to kill him. That his heart couldn't take it.
Didn't Mr. Marsh also tell you that Miss Lawson felt bored here and was thinking about going back to Chicago for awhile?
Yes -- he mentioned it.
So, the woman he loved passionately was thinking about leaving. That must cause tremendous anxiety. Sleepless nights. Incredible stress.

I suppose.
I suppose.
So, isn't it possible that he was confiding in you about the pain he was feeling about losing what might be his last chance for love? That what he really was saying was that the uncertainty of her leaving was driving him crazy and if it didn't stop it was going to kill him. That if she did leave his heart couldn't take it.
I don't know. I'm not sure.
Well, think about it. Isn't it possible?
Well, think about it. Isn't it possible?
Yes. I suppose it's possible.
Who told you that?
He video taped you.
He video taped you.
That bastard!
That bastard!
I thought he was a kind, gentle man?
Yes, I slept with him but that was a long time ago.
You're lying. Marsh was wearing a cast on the tape. It was right before he went to Chicago and met Miss Lawson. He dumped you for her, didn't he?
Yes.
It must have been horrible. Having to go there -- seeing them together - - knowing he was sleeping with her in the same bed he did with you.
It must have been horrible. Having to go there -- seeing them together - - knowing he was sleeping with her in the same bed he did with you.
I was jealous. Of course I was hurt. He switched me off like a little toy he was finished playing with. But I didn't kill him.
I'm a practical woman Mr. Dulaney. Killing Andrew wasn't in my best interest. As it is I'm out of a job and I'm not in his will.
Money isn't the only reason people commit murder, Miss Braslow.
I've tried it.
You've tried it? Isn't it true that you've been in and out of Rehab centers for the last four years?
I've been to a few -- yes.
You don't like Miss Lawson much do you?
You don't like Miss Lawson much do you?
No.
No.
You don't like her because you were involved with Mr. Marsh before she came along. Isn't that true?
You don't like her because you were involved with Mr. Marsh before she came along. Isn't that true?
Yes.
Yes.
You resented the fact that she told you what to do in Mr. Marsh's house?
You resented the fact that she told you what to do in Mr. Marsh's house?
Yes.
And you resented that he cared for her in a way he once cared for you?
Yes.
Yes.
--And that Mr. Marsh paid less attention to you?
--And that Mr. Marsh paid less attention to you?
Yes.
Yes.
--and that he changed his will?
--and that he changed his will?
Yes.
In his previous will Mr. Marsh left you two hundred and fifty thousand dollars -- then he cut you out. Why do you think he did that?
She talked him into it. She wanted everything.
She talked him into it. She wanted everything.
Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a lot of money. That must have made you pretty angry?
Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a lot of money. That must have made you pretty angry?
Yes.
Yes.
Well - I'm a little confused. This is a charge receipt from Rosen's Drug Store where Mr. Marsh had an account. It's dated the day of the murder. Is this your signature?

Yes.
There's an item you picked up that's marked. Will you read it?

Dristan nasal spray.
Dristan nasal spray.
Would you read for us the time of the purchase?
Would you read for us the time of the purchase?
Three fifteen.
Three fifteen.
A.M -- or P.M.?
A.M -- or P.M.?
P.M.
P.M.
You see that's what bothers me. No other bottle of nasal spray was found in the house. The police looked. There was only the one bottle. But you say you didn't arrive until after Mr. Marsh was dead -- yet we know he was using the nasal spray prior to his death. How do you think it got there?

I don't know.
Isn't it true that you stopped by the house after you left the drug store and dropped off the items you bought?
No.
No.
Isn't it true that you put the cocaine in the bottle?
Isn't it true that you put the cocaine in the bottle?
No! Why would I want to kill him?
No! Why would I want to kill him?
Because you were jealous. Because he cut you out of the will. Because you have a cocaine habit to feed -- because you know that if Rebecca Lawson is found guilty the new will is void -- and there's a very good chance the old one would be honored.
You take what people say and make it ugly. You make others believe what you want them to. She should have been found guilty. She shouldn't have gotten off.
Then you would have gotten your money?
Then you would have gotten your money?
Yes.
Yes.
You killed him -- didn't you, Joanne?
What do you have in your purse?
What do you think I've got? A gun? Maybe I'm gonna kill you too. Maybe I'll blow your head off right now.
I'm gonna go to jail. I know they're gonna make it look like I did it. They gotta put it on someone.
Why'd you come here?
Why'd you come here?
To show you this. It's a letter from that lawyer, Koehler. He wrote it to me the day after I saw him. He's the one who told me I could get the money if Miss Lawson went to jail.

You didn't know about it before that?
You didn't know about it before that?
No.
Then why did you go see Mr. Koehler in the first place?
Because he called me.
Hi, Joe.
Frank -- what are you doing here?
Frank -- what are you doing here?
I need to ask you a question. What made you get in touch with Joanne Braslow?
I need to ask you a question. What made you get in touch with Joanne Braslow?
You know I can't talk about that.
You know I can't talk about that.
I'm not asking for names or specifics. I just want to know what prompted you to make the call?
I'm not asking for names or specifics. I just want to know what prompted you to make the call?
Sorry.
Yes.
And your sexual tastes were something that you hid from Miss Lawson?
And your sexual tastes were something that you hid from Miss Lawson?
Yes.
Yes.
And didn't Miss Lawson come home one day and find you in bed with your male lover?
And didn't Miss Lawson come home one day and find you in bed with your male lover?
Yes.
Yes.
And she left shortly after that?
Would it be fair to say that when she did find out it was a shock to her?
Yes.
Yes.
No further questions.
Are you going to represent me?
There are no charges against you. I'm here to decide if I'm going to represent you should that occur. Did you kill him?
Do you think I did it?
I don't know. That's why I'm asking you.
I don't know. That's why I'm asking you.
You must have some feeling. Some immediate impression. A young, attractive woman, involved with an older man who leaves her everything in his will. And the things that went on in that house. Such wild sex. What kind of picture does that paint?
You must have some feeling. Some immediate impression. A young, attractive woman, involved with an older man who leaves her everything in his will. And the things that went on in that house. Such wild sex. What kind of picture does that paint?
Not a very good one I'm afraid.
And that's exactly what the jury will see when they look at me. That's why I need a very good lawyer, Mr. Dulaney.
You're assuming the District Attorney is going to file charges.
He'll file. He's an ambitious man. Ambitious men build their careers on the bodies of others.
You still haven't answered my question.
Frank!
I'll have you out in a few hours.
I want you to know right now that the trial's going to be nasty. Your sex life is going to be dragged through the mud. They're going to say that you enticed Marsh -- led him down a dark path.
Andrew hardly needed leading. He was a very passionate man. He was eager to explore. I gave him what he wanted. We fulfilled each others needs.
Andrew hardly needed leading. He was a very passionate man. He was eager to explore. I gave him what he wanted. We fulfilled each others needs.
This is a very small town -- people here have very straight views on sex.
I'm used to being on the outside looking in. The same men who will publicly profess their moral outrage for my sexual tastes are the same ones who privately rest their sweaty little hands on my legs and talk about weekend trips together.
Those same men will be sitting on the jury.
Those same men will be sitting on the jury.
I am who I am. I can't deny it, anymore than you can deny who you are. I like sex different -- I like it wild. That's not a crime. I loved Andrew. We made love together. We made it differently, but we still made love. It was our way. It was private -- and now the whole world wants to look in through
Have you ever seen animals make love, Mr. Dulaney? They have such passion -- such savage emotion. They struggle, and snarl, and claw, but neither hurts the other. Not really.
No pain, no gain?
No pain, no gain?
Something like that.
Something like that.
We're not animals.
I think we're getting a little off the subject here.
I thought the subject was sex?

As it pertains to you -- not me. Did you always know you had different... tastes?

Yes.
Yes.
How?

I don't know if it's something I can explain to you.
I don't know if it's something I can explain to you.
Why not?
Why not?
Because -- it's beyond intellect. It's emotion. It's passion. It has to be experienced -- it can't be imagined.

Try.
When I was growing up we had a strawberry patch in our backyard. So did this family down the road. I used to sneak in their yard and steal their strawberries. It wasn't easy. The stone walls were high and I'd scrape my knees as I climbed over. On the other side were wild rose bushes. The thorns would dig into my legs and
If you had what you wanted at home why did you sneak into their yard?
If you had what you wanted at home why did you sneak into their yard?
Because -- somehow the fruit always tasted that much sweeter because of the pain it took to get to it.
How'd you meet Marsh?
I was at a cocktail party. Very trendy. Andrew was in Chicago on business. He had broken his wrist the week before and was wearing it in a sling. He looked so helpless.
-- And then?
We started talking. In fact, we talked until four in the morning. We discovered we shared a lot of the same interests. After that we were together all the time until he left. He used to call me every night after he came back. Then after a few weeks he invited me to come visit him. I've never left.

Why didn't you live together?
Can we get out of here?
Sure. Where to?
This is your house.
I know.
Why not?
Because, I'm your attorney. I shouldn't be going to your house.
Because, I'm your attorney. I shouldn't be going to your house.
Is it against the law?

No -- it just doesn't look right.

Oh -- Well, they're different.

That's not an answer.

It's not my taste.
It's not my taste.
Tastes can change.
Nothing.
Not true. Shall I tell you what you were thinking? You were wondering if I was wearing anything under my skirt.
Hello?
Hi. It's Frank.
Hi. It's Frank.
Hi, Frank.
Hi, Frank.
I just wanted to see if my secretary called to confirm your appointment tomorrow.
I just wanted to see if my secretary called to confirm your appointment tomorrow.
Yes -- she did.
Yes -- she did.
Great. I'll see you at the office at nine.
Great. I'll see you at the office at nine.
No -- not at the office. I've got a better idea.
Yeah.
Andrew loved this old cabin. He always dreamed about moving to Tahiti -- living in a hut and becoming a beach-bum. I could never imagine myself doing that -- but somehow when he talked about it, he made it sound so alive - - so wonderful. Soft ocean breezes and beautiful sunsets -- leaving the world and it's problems behind. I wish he'd had
Sorry.
It's okay.
Tell me about Doctor Paley?
I hardly know him. He wanted me and he couldn't have me.
I hardly know him. He wanted me and he couldn't have me.
It's going to be hard to convince a jury that he's testifying against you in a murder trial because you blew him off.

It won't be that hard.
Did you always want to be a lawyer?
No -- I wanted to be a professional hockey player.
No -- I wanted to be a professional hockey player.
Really?

Yeah.
Yeah.
That seems so far away from who you are now. What happened?
That seems so far away from who you are now. What happened?
I broke my ankle skating. That ended that dream.
I broke my ankle skating. That ended that dream.
It's hard to let go of a dream, isn't it? To let go of what you want?
Yes -- it would be nice.
What would?
What would?
You and me -- making love.
You and me -- making love.
Is that what you think I was thinking?
Is that what you think I was thinking?
No -- that's what I know you were thinking.
There's nothing wrong in admitting that you want me, Frank.
You take a lot for granted.
You lied to me!
What?
What?
I just left Joanne Braslow. She told me she saw you doing cocaine at Marsh's house!
I just left Joanne Braslow. She told me she saw you doing cocaine at Marsh's house!
She's mistaken.
She's mistaken.
That's not good enough, Goddamit!
That's not good enough, Goddamit!
It isn't true. You have to believe me.
It isn't true. You have to believe me.
No, I don't have to believe you. The jury has to believe you and answers like he's lying or she's mistaken aren't going to convince them.
No, I don't have to believe you. The jury has to believe you and answers like he's lying or she's mistaken aren't going to convince them.
I don't use cocaine anymore. If she says she saw me doing it she's lying.
I don't use cocaine anymore. If she says she saw me doing it she's lying.
Why would she lie?
Why would she lie?
I don't know, Frank -- but don't you think that's something we should find out?
I called you all weekend. Where were you?
I went out on the boat.
Alone?
Of course.
You were brilliant today.
It's only the beginning.
Can I see you later?
You can see me now.
Something wrong?
Paley could be a problem tomorrow.
I'm sure you'll be able to handle him.
I'm glad you have such confidence in me.
I'm glad you have such confidence in me.
Don't worry about Paley. He can't touch me. No one can. I've thought it all out.
Don't worry about Paley. He can't touch me. No one can. I've thought it all out.
What does that mean? You've been thinking about the case? Or you thought everything out before you killed Marsh?
Sugar or honey?
Honey.
Rebecca -- take these off.
Tonight we open new doors.
What are you going you doing?
Are you scared?
What's that for?
To celebrate how masterfully you destroyed Roston today.

Rebecca -- we shattered a man's life in open court.

He was only doing what he thought was right.

You're too weak, Frank. When you want something you have to do what- ever it takes to get it. If something gets in your way you remove it.
You killed him -- didn't you?
I knew you were thinking that. I could see it in your eyes today in the courtroom. You're wrong, Frank. I need you to believe that.
I knew you were thinking that. I could see it in your eyes today in the courtroom. You're wrong, Frank. I need you to believe that.
You don't need anybody.
You don't need anybody.
I do need you. No matter what you think of me -- I didn't do it.
I'm dropping the case.
No -- you're not.
You can think whatever you want, Frank -- but I didn't kill Andrew, and I'm not going to prison for something I didn't do.
You're a monster.
You're a monster.
No -- I'm a survivor.
Hello?
Frank -- It's Rebecca. I need to see you right away. I've got the tape.
You killed him. You killed him -- and I got you off.
That's crazy.
I've been thinking about that. I've decided to give it to you after I've collected the inheritance. You can take that one if you want -- but there's another copy.
That wasn't the deal.
That wasn't the deal.
So, sue me. Things have changed. I think you should go home -- and after you leave I see no reason for us to ever have contact again.

I'm not leaving without that tape.
I'm not leaving without that tape.
Don't push me, Frank. I might lose my temper and send it out just for spite.
She's right, Paley. You've got to kill me. She doesn't have to -- she's free -- she can't be tried again -- but you, you planned it with her. You supplied the Coke. You're an accessory to murder.
Shoot him.
No -- he's lying.
How's it supposed to work Rebecca? You and Paley celebrate your victory. You get me over here and provoke a fight so he has to rush in and save you -- but then he's given himself away as your accomplice -- now he has to kill me. After that I figure she'll tell the Police that you broke in. That you were crazed because

Don't listen to him. Can't you see he's trying to turn you against me.
Andrew Marsh was a very wealthy man. A trial like this is going to put Cardenas in the spot-light.
We've already got press arriving from over the country and she hasn't even been charged yet. Cardenas wants to see her in his office tomorrow at ten. I'd like you to go with her.
We've already got press arriving from over the country and she hasn't even been charged yet. Cardenas wants to see her in his office tomorrow at ten. I'd like you to go with her.
I'm supposed to be on vacation.
I know -- but she wants you to represent her if Cardenas files.
Why?
Why?
Because I told her you were the best criminal attorney we have.
Because I told her you were the best criminal attorney we have.
Raymond, I'm the only criminal attorney you have.
Raymond, I'm the only criminal attorney you have.
Well, I guess that makes you the best. Look, Frank -- she stands to inherit three million dollars. As executors of the estate and her attorneys that could generate a lot of legal fees for us. All I'm asking you to do is talk to her.
Alright, I'll talk to her
She's waiting in the conference room.
What are they saying?
The kids at school say she humped Mr. Marsh to death.
The kids at school say she humped Mr. Marsh to death.
Hey, you know better than that. What did I teach you to say when someone is accused of doing something?
Hey, you know better than that. What did I teach you to say when someone is accused of doing something?
She allegedly humped him to death?
You know how it is sometimes when you're out playing ball with your friends? How you're really concentrating on what you're doing -- and you lose track of time and you come home late and Mom yells at you?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, that's kind of how I am right now.
Well, that's kind of how I am right now.
Is Mom yelling at you too?
I love you.
I love you too, Dad.
Michael -- get off the phone.
Why?
Why?
Because I'm expecting a call.
Because I'm expecting a call.
-- But it's Sunday.
-- But it's Sunday.
I know what day it is! Get off the phone.
I know what day it is! Get off the phone.
I gotta go. I'll call you later.
Do it quickly, Mr. Dulaney.
"Discourteous insinuations about his sexual abilities." Who told you to say that?
Mr. Dulaney, before you cast aspersions on the District Attorney's Office by suggesting they've coaxed this witness to say things that aren't true -- you better have more than a hunch. Do you?
No, Your Honor.
No, Your Honor.
Maybe you don't know what it's like where Mrs. Crawford comes from -- but I do. I came from a neighborhood just like hers. This is a whole other world for her. She's a poor working woman who has been thrust into a room full of highly educated and mostly unsympathetic people. So, she puts on her best dress, fixes her hair and tries
But Your Honor--
That's it, Mr. Dulaney. Take a seat.
Objection. The witness has already stated that Miss Lawson left without an explanation.
Mr. Cardenas, I suggest you move on to another line of questioning.
The witness will answer the question.
Mr. Roston?
Miss Braslow, I'd like to remind you that you are still under oath.
How often do you use cocaine?
Your Honor -- the prosecution has introduced cocaine as one of the contributing reasons Mr. Marsh died. How it may have been introduced into the household is of vital importance.
Are you able to back up this allegation -- or are you fishing?
Are you able to back up this allegation -- or are you fishing?
I can back it up.
I can back it up.
You better. Please answer the question.
You're on vacation, remember? You're supposed to be relaxing.
I am relaxing.
I am relaxing.
This is not relaxing.
This is not relaxing.
Really?
Really?
Really.
Really.
And I suppose you're going to show me how to relax?
And I suppose you're going to show me how to relax?
If you want me to.
If you want me to.
I'm always open to learning new things.
Can't it wait?
No -- it has to be done by tomorrow.
Hello?... Hi Raymond.... What?... Well, I was sort of planning on... Alright... Okay, goodbye. That was Sattler. He thinks the D.A.'s going to file on Rebecca Lawson. He wants me in the office tomorrow morning.
We're supposed to go to the lake.
We're supposed to go to the lake.
I know. What can I do? He is the boss.
I know. What can I do? He is the boss.
He could let you have your vacation.
I swear -- the both of you. Some example you set.
Some example you set.
How can Cardenas possibly think he can build a case against two consenting adults?
He must have something or he wouldn't be pressing so hard.
He must have something or he wouldn't be pressing so hard.
If he files are you going to take the case?
If he files are you going to take the case?
I don't know yet. I want to hear what she says at her statement tomorrow.
I don't know yet. I want to hear what she says at her statement tomorrow.
What's she like?
What's she like?
Attractive. Bright. Distant. Charming when she wants to be.
She sounds like quite a woman.
Yeah -- but can she cook?
Humped
Yes.
Yes.
I can think of worse ways to go--
Frank -- I know you're busy, but Michael asked me after dinner if you were angry with him. He wanted to know why you weren't talking to him.
I'll talk to him later.
I'll talk to him later.
Why don't you talk to him now?
Why don't you talk to him now?
Because I go to trial in seven weeks. I've got a lot of preparing to do.
Because I go to trial in seven weeks. I've got a lot of preparing to do.
No one's asking you not to work. I just think you could make some time for your son.
Is that alright, Frank?
Yeah -- fine. Excuse me. I'll be right back.
Yeah -- what are you doing up?
We have to talk.
We have to talk.
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
That's what I was hoping you'd tell me.
Sharon, it's late. Can we get to the point?
Where have you been?
Working. Charlie and I were going over some statements.
Charlie called at eleven thirty looking for you. You were with her, weren't you?
Charlie called at eleven thirty looking for you. You were with her, weren't you?
Yes.
Yes.
Why did you lie to me?
Why did you lie to me?
Because I knew you'd think exactly what you're thinking.
This isn't a courtroom. Don't try to turn this around on me.
I'm not.
I'm not.
You're sleeping with her, aren't you?
You're sleeping with her, aren't you?
No.
No.
It's bad enough that you are. It's even worse that you can stand here and lie to me.
I was thinking that when the trial is over we'd all go skiing for a weekend.
Maybe it would be a good idea if you just took Michael.
I know.
Talk to me.
You wouldn't like what you'd see. You don't know me anymore. I don't know me anymore.
We can't pretend this isn't happening.
We can't pretend this isn't happening.
Please -- not now.
Please -- not now.
Why didn't you come to me?
Why didn't you come to me?
I don't know.
I don't know.
You used to like to touch me -- to make love to me.
You used to like to touch me -- to make love to me.
It's more involved than that.
It's more involved than that.
It was a place to start.
It was a place to start.
You think that's the answer? Sex? Is that what you want? You want me to make love to you?
You think that's the answer? Sex? Is that what you want? You want me to make love to you?
I don't want our lives ruined because of this. I love you, Frank. I want this to work -- but you have to help me. You have to come back from where ever it is you are.
Frank -- stop it! Stop it!
Is this what you want -- huh? Is it?
Albert's got the stomach flu.
That's too bad.
That's too bad.
No, it's not. Now I get to pitch.
No, it's not. Now I get to pitch.
Michael, you shouldn't be happy when someone else isn't feeling well.
Michael, you shouldn't be happy when someone else isn't feeling well.
Not even if they're a dork?
Not even if they're a dork?
Not even if they're a dork. You should go by and see how he's feeling.
Don't use language like that at the dinner table.
Sorry.
Let me go! Godammit, Frank let go!
Daddy -- stop it!
I didn't know that Andrew was dead until Mr. Sattler called me at home that night.
We have a witness who saw you go into the house at four thirty.
Yes.
What time did you leave?
What time did you leave?
Six thirty -- and he was very much alive.
Did Marsh use it?
No -- never.
No -- never.
It had to get there somehow.
It had to get there somehow.
It didn't get there from me.
No, we just had lunch at the hotel with my brother and his new wife. She told me all the dirt. I forgot how interesting things can get around here. It was so good to see them. The last time we visited they were in Europe. He is doing so well. He ordered champagne. For lunch! I nearly died.
I nearly died when we split the bill.
I nearly died when we split the bill.
Michael doesn't understand. People who make the kind of money my brother makes don't carry money on them. They keep it all in various accounts.
Michael doesn't understand. People who make the kind of money my brother makes don't carry money on them. They keep it all in various accounts.
Then we should have had lunch at the bank.
Boy. It sure has been a long time.
We were here two Christmases ago.
We were here two Christmases ago.
Well, that's a long time.
Well, that's a long time.
It's not that long.
It's not that long.
Well, why don't I just say black so you can say white! Don't be surprised to find your brother hasn't changed an iota. He hardly ever talks and when he does it's in that tone! You should have heard him at lunch -- not two words until the bill came and then he says, "Worth every penny."

SO!
SO!
You said it in that tone! Like you were angry at me, my brother, at the world for forcing you to eat a nice lunch!
You said it in that tone! Like you were angry at me, my brother, at the world for forcing you to eat a nice lunch!
Oh Jesus.
Oh Jesus.
I simply can not stand that tone!
My Jewish friend's grandmother did.
Well, no one in my family did! Dad bought cemetery plots at Oak Ridge. One for him, one for mom.
Not to mention people driving over her and doggies doing their business --
We're not doing it! I'm not even sure it's Christian.
We're not doing it! I'm not even sure it's Christian.
Maybe it's an Italian thing. Their mother was Italian.
Maybe it's an Italian thing. Their mother was Italian.
Doesn't matter. Move on.
It's a beautiful picture of her.
Why are there two deeds here?
I don't mind waiting.
Well, there's a lot of boring stuff to do. Lists of people we have to write to. Find mama's relatives addresses in Italy -- stuff like that.

Well, I can help.
Well, I can help.
I said NO!
I am so sick and tired of apologizing and not knowing what I've done!
I'm sure you haven't done anything. Have some iced tea. How are the kids?
Eeeww!
I know. I don't understand it either.
How bizarre!
Mr. Peterson, are you sure mama wrote all this?
Oh, just a old letter from a friend.
No treasure maps, huh?
No treasure maps, huh?
No.
I do not need instructions from you to bathe! I knew you'd do this! I knew I'd come all the way here and be shut out as usual! I came to be here for you! I didn't have to come! Lord knows I was never much welcome in this house before. Apparently dead or alive, nothing's changed.
Aw, Betty.
Carolyn -- you want these candlesticks?
No. You can have them.
Explain to me again why we didn't do this in Des Moines in an air conditioned office?
Mom's orders.
Mom's orders.
Lawyer here?
Lawyer here?
I have some sandwich fixings if you're hungry.
He dropped them off at Betty's mom. Where's Steve?
He's not coming.
I thought everything WAS arranged.
Well, there's a problem.
Well, there's a problem.
What problem?
I remember a Mrs. Delaney but Mama told me years ago she died.
Well, I don't care if it's legal or not, we're not cremating her and throwing her all over some bridge where we can't even go visit her because she's going to be blown all over the place like an ashtray.
Yeah.
Michael.
Michael.
What?!
What?!
Come here a minute.
"-- going over and over in my mind every detail, every moment of our time together and I ask myself, "What happened to me in Madison County?" I struggle to put it together in a way that allows me to continue knowing we're on separate roads. But then I look through the lens of my camera, and you're there. I start to write an
Goddamn sonofabitch! I don't want to hear anymore! Sonofabitch! Burn the damn thing! I don't want to hear it! Throw it away!
What's he saying now?
Well, he just gets on about how if mama ever needed him, she could find him through the National Geographic magazine. He as a photographer. He promises not to write again. Then all it says is... I love you... Robert.

Robert! Jesus! I'll kill him.
Robert! Jesus! I'll kill him.
That would be some trick. He's already dead. That's what this other letter is. From his attorney. He left most of his things to mama and requested...

That he be cremated and his ashes thrown on Roseman Bridge.

DAMN HIM! I knew mama wouldn't have thought of that herself. It was some damn perverted... photographic mind influencing her! When did the bastard die?

Wait a minute! That was thirty years after daddy. Do you think...?

I don't know. I'm completely in the dark here. That's what I get for moving away.

This happened way before we both got married. I... I can't believe it. You think she had sex with him?
My Lord. It must feel real nice living inside your head with Peter Pan and the Easter Bunny.
Don't talk to me like that. She was my mother for Christsakes. And now I find out she was... She was a --!

Well, what am I supposed to think?

I can't believe she never told me? We spoke at least once a week. How could she do that?

How did she meet him? Did Dad know? Anything else in that envelope?

No, I don't think so. I --
I can't believe she's making jokes.
Sshhh. "After going through the safety deposit box, I'm sure you'll find you're way to this letter. It's hard to write this to my own children. I could let this die with the rest of me, I suppose. But as one gets older, one fears subside. What becomes more and more important is to be known -- known for all that you were during
Grateful!?
"... It's all there in the three notebooks. Read them in order. If you don't want to, I suppose that's okay too. But in that case I want you to know something -- I never stopped loving your father.

That's it!
What are you doing?
This is crazy. She waits till she's dead to tell us all this. Well, I got news for you. She was my mother. That's enough for me. I don't have to know who she was.

No. We're going to lock this up and --

STOP IT! I want to read them! If you don't want to, then just leave. But don't you push me around like I'm some mule you paid for -- I already GOT A HUSBAND!
He's getting her drunk. That's what happened. Jesus, maybe he forced himself. That's why she couldn't tell us.
Oh, he did not. He's such a nice guy.
Oh, he did not. He's such a nice guy.
Nice? He's trying to sleep with somebody's wife.
Nice? He's trying to sleep with somebody's wife.
I don't think so. Not yet anyway. And besides, something like that doesn't make you a bad person. He reminds me of Steve in a way. Steve's weak, immoral and a liar but he's still a real nice guy. He just shouldn't be married. At least not to me. You getting hungry? I'm hungry.
I had no idea it's gotten that bad, sis.
Oh, don't feel sorry for me. Please. No one's forcing me to stay.
Oh, don't feel sorry for me. Please. No one's forcing me to stay.
Then why do you?
Then why do you?
And do what? Live alone? Go back to school? Find someone else? Start a magazine for confused woman? ... What if I can't do any of those things?
Bar across the street.
Have you called Betty? Maybe you should.

I think I better. Between the book and the coffee, I'm this close to raping the busboy.
I used to love this place. I used to take Kathy Reynolds down here.
You never dated Kathy Reynolds!

Not officially. Her and Steve Kendall were pinned at birth. But I was crazy about her. And for about three months, I managed to catch her during her "exploring" stage.

-- for over twenty years because that's what I was taught -- you stick with it! Normal people don't get divorced. I can't remember the last time my husband made love to me so intensely that he transported me to Europe, for Christ's sake -- quite frankly, I don't think he ever did! And now I find out in between bake sales, my mother

What about me! I feel really weird. Like she cheated on me, not dad. Isn't that sick? I don't mean I wanted to sleep with her or anything but -- ya know -- being the only son.

You're right -- that is sick.
Mrs. Delaney. Did you hear the latest?
No, what?
See. Money don't buy happiness. I must say, she's taking it well.
I'd kill him. Him and that Redfield woman. Together. First one then the other. And then I'd laugh.

I'd laugh first then I'd kill them. Make sure they heard me laughing.
She's changed.
Oh, yes.
Oh, yes.
She used to be so friendly.
My niece had "the changes" when she was thirty-one.
No. What a tragedy. What happened?
No. What a tragedy. What happened?
She changed.
Oh, this heat! Times like this I wish we took that offer from your brother and moved on up to Michigan.
They got heat in Michigan.
They got heat in Michigan.
Not this kind of heat.
Not this kind of heat.
Heat is heat.
Heat is heat.
Heat is not heat! There's different kinds! And this heat is much hotter than what they got in Michigan. You go and call your brother and see if he don't say the same thing.

I'll get right on it.
Well, nobody put a gun to his head.
Oh, shut up! It's the woman who's in control of these situations. Men don't know which end is up till a woman points.
What do you know about "the changes"?
Well, I didn't know they was a secret club.
Well, I didn't know they was a secret club.
Don't talk about what you don't know. Besides, she's too young for "the changes."
Madge?
Hi. I made some brown betty. I sent Floyd off to town with the boy. I said - "Floyd, I'm going to visit my girlfriend and spend the afternoon and that's all there is to it. He said who's going to make lunch? I said I'm taking a sick day. Eat at the dinner." Isn't that hilarious? He didn't dare raise an eyebrow --
Madge. Please. Something's happened. I've met someone. I've fallen in love in a way I've never thought could happen my entire life. It's our last day together. I feel like I'm going to die when he leaves. Please. Help me.
Oh, honey. I'm so sorry. But you've got to be grateful for even feeling the little you've be given. Believe me. Go to him. Don't let him leave without these new precious hours you've got left. And if you need anyone to cry on, you know where I am.
I don't know. I woke up a little dizzy. I didn't sleep well. I think I need to lay down.
You want me to call the doctor?
You want me to call the doctor?
No, no. I just didn't sleep well. I'm not used to sleeping alone. And this heat. Would you mind?
No, no. I just didn't sleep well. I'm not used to sleeping alone. And this heat. Would you mind?
No, of course not. I'll just clean up.
No, of course not. I'll just clean up.
No, leave it. I'll do it later. Listen, maybe you and Floyd can come for dinner on Saturday. I'm sure Richard'll have so many stories to tell you both about the fair and all.
No, leave it. I'll do it later. Listen, maybe you and Floyd can come for dinner on Saturday. I'm sure Richard'll have so many stories to tell you both about the fair and all.
Oh, that'll be nice.

Yeah.
Roseman Bridge?
That's it.
That's it.
Well, you're pretty close. It's only about two miles from here.
Well, you're pretty close. It's only about two miles from here.
Oh, terrific. Which way?
If I'm not taking you away from anything.
No. I was just going to have some iced tea then split the atom, but that can wait. I just have to get my shoes.
Pretty country.
Hmm-mmm.
There's a wonderful smell about Iowa -- very particular to this part of the country. Do you know what I mean?
No.
No.
I can't describe it. I think it's from the loam in the soil. This very rich, earthy kind of... alive... No. No, that's not right. Can you smell it?

No, really?
No, really?
Oh, yeah. Actually, I had an assignment in Greece and I had to go through Bari to get the boat at Brindisi. But it looked so pretty I got off and stayed for a few days. Breathtaking country.
You just... got off the train because it looked pretty?
Yeah. Excuse me a sec.
So, how long you've been living here?
Long. You just got off the train and stayed without knowing anyone there?
Long. You just got off the train and stayed without knowing anyone there?
Yeah.
This won't take long. I'm shooting tomorrow morning. I just need to do some prep work.
I don't mind waiting.
This time of year.
Would you do me a favor and go to the truck? Inside that leather bag with the pockets is a package of lens cleaners. Would you grab me one?
Oh there you are.
Oh! You caught me.
Men sill give women flowers, don't they? I mean, as a sign of appreciation? I'm not that out of date, am I?
No, not at all -- except those are poisonous.
No, not at all -- except those are poisonous.
WHAT!
Are you by nature a sadistic person?
No, I'm not. I don't know why I said that. I've been in a very... strange mood all day. I've never done anything like that before. It's... I'm just... Well, you know, the whole world is just going nuts.
Looking for something in particular? There's not much of a selection.
I found this Chicago station before. Wait a minute... Here it is.
Oh, that's nice.
Want another cigarette?
Want another cigarette?
Sure.
Well, thank you for all your help, Mrs. Johnson.
Francesca.
Francesca.

Lemon?
Sure.
Mind if I smoke?

I'm so sorry about that. It was rude. I think I just got nervous for some reason.

Everything does. One of the laws of nature. People are always so afraid of change. But if you look at it like it's something you can count on happening, it's actually a comfort. Not many things you can count on for sure.
I guess. Except I'm one of the people it frightens.

What's he like?
He's very... clean.

No. I mean yes, he's clean but he's also other things. He's a very hard worker. Very honest. Very caring. Gentle. Good father.

I think so.
I better go. You sure you're all right? It's been a pleasure. Sincerely.
I feel so embarrassed.
I feel so embarrassed.
Why? You uncorked a bottle. From what I can tell, I got here just in time. Any later and you'd have made the front page, running down Main Street naked, smoking Camels out of your butt.

But I... We don't even know each other.
You have no reason to feel ashamed. You haven't said anything you don't have a right to. And if anybody tells you different -- you just send them to me.
Would you like to stay for dinner? There aren't many choices in town and ... anyway, you'd have to eat alone. So would I.
That's very nice of you. I don't get many dinner invitations on the job. It would be a welcome change. Thanks.
Help cook?
Sure. Men cook. We don't all eat bananas with our feet, ya know.

Then what happened?

We got engaged.
We got engaged.
Oh you!
You ought to write these stories down.
Nah. I've tried. My writing's too technical, I think. Problem of being a journalist too long is you stop giving yourself permission to invent. I better just stick to making pictures.

You sound like an artist.
You sound like an artist.
No. I wouldn't say that. National Geographic isn't exactly the hub of artistic inspiration. They like their wild life in focus and without any personal comment. I don't mind really. I'm not artist. I'd faced that a long time ago. It's the course of being well-adjusted. I'm too normal.

I don't think you're normal.
I didn't mean that the way it sounded.
Well, let's just call it a compliment and move on. Did you love teaching?
And did you?
I'd like to think so. I know one of them went on to Medical school.

I don't know. I've never thought about it... what was the most exciting place you've ever been to? Unless you're tired of talking about it.
You're asking a man if he's too tired to talk about himself? You don't get out much, do you?
I'm sorry. That was...
No. It's all right. I just meant, it might be a little dull for you, telling all this to some housewife in the middle of nowhere.
No. It's all right. I just meant, it might be a little dull for you, telling all this to some housewife in the middle of nowhere.
This is your home. It's not nowhere. And it's not dull.
My God. How I'd love to see that.
They have safaris for tourists now. Maybe you can convince your husband.
Well, it's kind of buggy out there.
Have no fear. This Shoshone Medicine Woman taught me how to make bug repellent tea out of tree root.

No, you rub it on you. I have some in the truck. Don't go away.
Smells like dirt.
You get used to it.
You get used to it.
When?
When?
You want to go back in?
You want to go back in?
No. I'm all right. It's working.
You've got it all right here, you know. It's just as beautiful as any other place I've seen. God, it knocks me out.
What?
What?
This "... Of what I call God and fools can Nature." Who wrote that?
This "... Of what I call God and fools can Nature." Who wrote that?
Umm, I don't know. I can look it up.
Umm, I don't know. I can look it up.
I'd appreciate it. I like knowing who I'm stealing from. If you can't create art I think the least you can do is recognize it around you, don't you think? There is... ... so much beauty.
You sure you won't let me help you with those dishes?
No. I'll do them later.
No. I'll do them later.

Yes.

We're not doing anything wrong, do you.
Do you mind if I... ask you why you got divorced?
Not at all. I wasn't around much... So why did I get married? Well, I thought it was a good idea at the time. Have a home base. Roots. You can get lost moving around so much.

So what happened?
So what happened?
I never got lost. For some reason, I'm more at home everywhere than at one place. So I decided I'll think of myself as some kind of world citizen. I belong everywhere and nowhere. I'm kin to everyone, and no one in particular. See, once you get into the habit of not needing anyone, it's kind of hard to break.

I'm a loner, I'm not a monk.
You really don't need anyone?
No, I think I need everyone! I love people. I want to meet them all! I just think there are too many out there saying "This is mine." or "She's mine." Too many lines have been drawn. World's breaking apart because of man's weakness for some testosterone conquests over territory and power and people. He wants control over what deep down he knows he

I'm a little sick of this American Family Ethic everyone seems to be hypnotized by in this country. I guess you think I'm just some poor displaced soul doomed to roam the earth without a self-cleaning oven and home movie.

Just because someone chooses to settle down and have a family doesn't necessarily mean they're hypnotized. Just because I've never seen a gazelle stampede doesn't mean I'm asleep in the world.

I thought that's what we were doing -- asking questions.

You know that little place nearby with the striped awning that sells sandwiches and little pizzas...
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's okay. It's not that hot anymore. Thanks God.
I just feel like I'm getting a little ... out of control that's all. It's kind of frightening.
Why?
Why?
Why!? Because, I'm having thoughts I hardly know what to do with. I... can't seem to... stop them.

Where was she?
Across the street. She went into the park and got turned around and didn't know her way out.
I don't know why I'm so tired all of a sudden.
Long day. Go to sleep.

Am I too heavy for you?

Well, these... women friends of yours... all over the world. How does it work? Do you see some of them again? Do you forget others? Do you write them now and then? How do you manage it?
I... What do you want?
Well, I just want to know the procedure. I don't want to upset your routine. Do you want any jam?

I was honest with you. I told you who I was.
I was honest with you. I told you who I was.
Yes. Absolutely. You have this habit of not needing and that it's hard to break. I understand. Of course, in that case, why sleep -- you don't need rest or for that matter eat, you don't need food.
What are you doing?
Gee, I don't know. I guess I'm not cut out to be a World Citizen who experiences everything and nothing at the same time.

You have no idea what you've done to me, do you? And after you leave, I'm going to have to wonder for the rest of my life what happened here. If anything happened at all!

I won't be made to feel like I've done something wrong.
You won't be made to feel! Period. You've carved out this little part for yourself in the world where you get to be a voyeur, a hermit and a lover whenever you feel like it and the rest of us are just supposed to feel so incredibly grateful for the brief time you've touched our lives! Well, go to hell! It isn't human not

BECAUSE I CAN'T HAVE YOU!
BECAUSE I CAN'T HAVE YOU!
WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH IT?
If I've done anything to make you think that what's happened between us is nothing new for me -- is some routine -- then I do apologize.
What makes it different, Robert?
No matter how I keep turning it around in my mind -- it doesn't seem like the right thing.
For who?
For who?
For anyone. They'll never be able to live through the talk. Richard will never be able to. He doesn't deserve that. He hasn't hurt anyone in his life.

No, they don't say much. But Carolyn's 16. She's just about to find out about all this for herself -- she's going to fall in love, she's going to try and figure out how to build a life with someone. If I leave what does that say to her?

Yeah. It could get better.

No matter how much distance we put between us and this house, I bring with it with me. And I'll feel it every minute we're together. And I'll blame loving you for how much it hurts. And then even these four days won't be anything more than something sordid and... a mistake.

Francesca, listen to me. You think what's happened to us happens to just anybody? What we feel for each other? How much we feel? We're not even two separate people anymore. Some people search their whole lives for it and wind up alone -- most people don't even think it exists and you're going to tell me that giving it up is the right

We are the choices we've made, Robert.
We are the choices we've made, Robert.
TO HELL WITH YOU!
Robert. Please. You don't understand -- no one does. When a woman makes the choice to marry, to have children -- in one way her life begins but in another way it stops. You build a life of details. You become a mother, a wife and you stop and stay steady so that your children can move. And when they leave they take your
But now that you have it -
But now that you have it -
I want to keep it forever. I want to love you the way I do now the rest of my life. Don't you understand -- we'll lose it if we leave. I can't make an entire life disappear to start a new one. All I can do is try to hold onto to both. Help me. Help me not lose loving you.
I don't know. Please...
I'm going to be here a few more days. I'll be at the Inn. We have some time. Let's not say any more now.

Mrs. Johnson! Mrs. Johnson! Is it true Cary Grant has proposed to you?
Yes. And I've accepted.
Yes. And I've accepted.
What about his engagement to Dyan Cannon?

What about your husband?

I'm very sad but Richard said that since it's Cary Grant, he completely understands. I'm also taking Mrs. Delaney away from this town. She'll be living with Cary and I in Beverly Hills.
You feeling better Franny?
Yes. I'm fine. It's just this heat I think.
It's a Chicago station. I found it the other day.

I'm not sick, Richard. I'm just not tired, now go back to sleep before you're up for the whole night too!
"I had forgotten this. I had somehow remembered it being more his fault, his decision. Then I remembered we made love in that field before we left for home. And I remembered it was my idea. I remembered tearing his shirt and biting his body, hoping he would kidnap me. I had forgotten that too. And I wondered, as I sat there... how many

Isn't that nice? You should bring her home to meet us!
Oh my God...!
What happened?
What happened?
I was paying the check. She ran outside. I told her to wait for me right here! Oh God, where is she? Rebecca!
Think for a second. Is there someplace she said she wanted to go?
I don't remember!
About an hour ago.
They're not going to find her!
They're not going to find her!
Yes, they are.
Your mother left explicit instructions that she wished to be cremated.
Cremated?!
When did she decide this?
Apparently just before her death.
Apparently just before her death.
Well, that's crazy. I don't know anybody who gets cremated.
It clearly states in the will --
I don't care what it says! Maybe Mama was delirious, you know. She didn't know what she was saying. If she wanted to be cremated, why the hell did she let dad buy two plots, huh?
I don't care what it says! Maybe Mama was delirious, you know. She didn't know what she was saying. If she wanted to be cremated, why the hell did she let dad buy two plots, huh?
Well, she was very specific. She wanted her ashes to be thrown over Roseman Bridge.
Well, she was very specific. She wanted her ashes to be thrown over Roseman Bridge.
WHAT!
Well, it was notarized, and witnessed by a Mrs. Lucy Delaney. Maybe you can ask her.
Who the hell is Lucy Delaney?
Don't feed that dog.
You people really don't like dogs.
You people really don't like dogs.
Some holes can't be filled. Some hungers can't be satisfied.
Outta my way, boy. Cinnabar? I'm coming!
Why don't you hang on and I'll see if she's here.
Why don't you hang on and I'll see if she's here.
I know damn well she's there.
We can't go back there. Are you crazy? You saw --
It's the only way. It's possible your father may not be dead yet.
Your father was his best friend. He loved Jeremiah. So he must hate him the most of all now. He'll take his time. But even if it is too late. If your father is dead. It's not over. The door has to be closed.
Well, close the fucking door by all means. But don't expect me to go down there and do it.
Well, close the fucking door by all means. But don't expect me to go down there and do it.
I don't.

Look around, this place is a dump! Naw, it'd have to work to be a dump.
Are you nuts?
The man said just to use my imagination. Let's see...yeah, I get it. Potential. I can see it now. The first major urban theme park. Village Ghetto land. Kinda like Legoland, but made entirely from broken glass, hypodermic needles and crack vials. Totally E-ticket.

Ugh. Muchos moscos, man. This is too much.
Just some flies.
Just some flies.
Some flies? I think this qualifies as way more than "some."
Oh yeah, I guess this would be that space that was so perfect for a recording studio.
Maurice, man, shut the fuck up.
Boys and girls, Moms and Dads. Children of all ages, I'd like you to meet... Jimmy Bones.
What the hell you talking about?
What the hell you talking about?
"This is the story of Jimmy Bones/Black as night and hard as stones/Gold plated deuce, like the King of Siam/Got his switchblade loose, and a diamond on his hand..." There's the switchblade and there's the diamond. Don't know where the deuce is parked.
You think that's really him?
Damn. It's so...fresh.
...Bones ol' Bones so mean and bad, whupped his mamma, shot his dad.
Saw Bones ol' Bones on top of the hill. Rolling fat jays outta hundred dollar bills.
Can you take a little extended solo right about now, funk soul brotha?
Go for it.
Looks like a damn graveyard round here.
I'm telling you, this neighborhood is coming back.
Damn. That is the ugliest building I have ever seen.
Naw. I think it's... I dunno. Something about it just buzzes me.
You want us to move in here?
That's the only way we'll get the place fixed up in time.
You soundin' like the old man now.
I believe in you guys. You are the real shit. And you know it. Now I'm putting everything I got into this cuz I think we can make it happen, but you gotta put a little in too. Now all I"m asking is that everybody do their part. We'll move some shit in, and take shifts, or all crash together here --

Let's get going. Go home, pick up what we need, then crash here.
Shit.
Spooked?
No. Well, yeah. Maybe just a little.
Yeah, there is a strange vibe here.
Where's the others?
Maurice left. Tia's taking a bath.

Whatever, let's just get the hellout of here.
You sure got a way with women, bro. What happened up there?
Damned if I know.
Where's the gangsta of love?
Probably stoned out of his gourd in some corner.
Probably stoned out of his gourd in some corner.
Well, go find his lazy ass. I scratch any more tonight I'm gonna have carpal tunnel syndrome.
You ain't going down there. Not alone. I'll go.
Fine. But I'm bringing a couple of friends.
We can climb out.
Climb out to where?
Climb out to where?
Anywhere but here.
Is this Hell?
Or just Hell-adjacent...

You wouldn't know a mule if it bit you in the ass. And personally, I don't need a mule. I got a Lexus. And nobody gave it to me --
That's what?
That's some terrible shit.

Don't you worry about a thing. This hand's gonna be stroking the back of your neck tonight.
Gotta be an in-ey and gotta be smooth. If it's ragged, it was picked too soon. Won't ever be ripe. Second, it's got to have just a little give, here. At the edges. And last, but not very far from least... You gotta get your nose in it and give it a gooooood, looooong sniff.
I don't know whether to chill you and serve with cottage cheese, or rip you open and eat you right here.
No? That mean there's something more left of you than just that hungry spirit? What are you going to do now? Kill us? Kill us all?
No. Not...not you. You I forgive.
Jimmy, you've got --
I've got what I want. Turn around baby, look at me. Look at your man.
I want you to do something for me, baby.

Hey Jimmy, you know Eddie Mack, don't you?
We met.
Everybody just be cool. Jimmy, man, I think you oughtta hear the deal.
I don't need to hear the deal. I don't need any partners. I don't need new product. And I sure as hell don't need this motherfucker's 'mattie in my face.
Sorry, my brother.
Since we was just grasshoppers...

You always told me, it's a dog eat dog world.

How did you get in here?

Time like this, is that what you really want to know? How I got the fuck in here?
I don't understand it. You were my Man. Since we was grasshoppas. I always looked after you. You had a piece of everything I had.
I didn't want a piece of yours, I wanted my own.
I didn't want a piece of yours, I wanted my own.
And the hell everybody else, right?
Wait, Jimmy. Think about it. You woulda done the same thing if you was me.
No brother. I wouldn'ta. I never done a man - any man. Let alone a brother like that. Course, as you can see, no good deed goes unfucked. Now the question is, if the good get fucked, what we got saved up for the bad? You about to find out.

And what's that?
And what's that?
Just a bad place. And the doorway to worse.
...I've seen things. In there. Last night. You did too. Don't tell me you didn't. You were crying like a baby.
You said the vision, the images. They're just that. Just pictures. They can't hurt you. That's what you always said.

If he was trying to kill you, you'd be dead.

Who? Who is he? What is he?
Who? Who is he? What is he?
Your father. He was your father.
You got his hands. Beautiful hands. I didn't even know. That night. When they - we - killed him, that you were already alive inside me. Life's like that. Grows right out of death.
But if it's him. If he's really come back, won't he know us? Love us?
But if it's him. If he's really come back, won't he know us? Love us?
Sure, if it was really him. But it isn't that simple. Jimmy's body died a long time ago. And his soul is long gone, and all that's left is that ravening, hungry spirit in the blood that soaked into the house itself, I suppose.

But how do you know? Maybe he just wanted to see us? And now he's gone again. And you've all killed my father for the second time.
He'll kill them. He'll kill every last one of them.
Who?
Who?
Eddie Mack, that cop. And Jeremiah. And even when he's done, who knows. He won't be satisfied. Just like that demon dog. Feed it, and it just grows hungrier. Feed his hunger for revenge - he just wants more. Who knows where it'll stop. That kind of hunger ain't never satisfied.

Like what? I got a little power, sure. A touch of the shining, a little of the sight. But no more than you do. We're not witches. I can't wiggle my nose or say a magic word and make him go away. Besides, maybe they deserve it. Maybe we all do.

No we won't, Momma. I'll just have them call and tell Patrick it's us.
Girl, they build gates like that to keep people like us out.

What? Oh yeah. Coming.
She doesn't want me here. With you. In this house.
Believe me, my old man'd rupture his spleen if he knew we was down here. All he talks about is the medal he deserves for building us a life as far from this 'hood as possible.

Let me see it.
Where is it?
Where is it?
I can't carry it in my pocket, man. And I can't go get it for you cause you might be a cop. You gonna have to pick it up yourself.
Don't worry. It's just round the corner. Halfway down that block, you can't miss it. Top step of the front stairs, there's a loose stone. Go on, I ain't shitting you.
Fuck it. Alright.
But maybe we're the ones who should be down there. Doing something. Making it better.
Can't be done. That place already died and gone to hell.
Where are we going? You know I hate surprises.
A little business move I made. On my own. I think you're gonna approve.
What are we doing down here?
Like you always said, Pop, look for the undervalued.
Listen to me, boy. I didn't work all my life to get out of this neighborhood for you to move right back in!

You're pretty black to be growing up in Rossmore Park.
You sure we oughta save him? Why not just let see how safe his gates and walls keep him when his past comes calling?
Save him? What are you talking about?
... see there ain't just two parts to a person. There's three. Body-Soul and Spirit. The spirit lives in the blood. It's the wanting that holds body and soul together, and sometimes, the wanting lives on. Jimmy's blood must still be in the house.
But the place burned to the ground.
But the place burned to the ground.
The blood is still there. We just gotta figure out where.
It's not safe down there. The fire started down there. The whole thing could collapse.
Then your father's a dead man and Jimmy Bones is gonna be around a long time.
Well, the bad news is we only made 25 bucks each.
How could that be? The box was packed!
How could that be? The box was packed!
Moe's terms.
Illibent? Who's club is that?
Ours!
There wasn't any draft. That window was closed.
We're all tired. Everybody makes mistakes. Tomorrow in the daylight, everything's gonna look different.
Boy, put that thing down. You can't take that. Might be evidence.
Evidence of what?
Evidence of what?
Somehow I don't think he stabbed himself in the chest, then buried himself too.
Shit! Damn dog. We gonna have to do something about you.
What we have to do is call the police.
Whoa, whoa. Come on, he's making too much noise.
You hear that, bitch? Be quiet!
You hear that, bitch? Be quiet!
Here, put this in his mouth.
You shouldn't have hit me.
You want to get into this now?
You want to get into this now?
No, no, Caesar. Not now.
Glenlivet, right, Gino?
I'll have whatever Violet's drinking.
So Caesar, what did it total out at?
Two point one seventy-six.
Come on, Pop, all I want to know is one thing. Just one thing after he made such a big deal out of it. I bet it wasn't a big deal. Was it, Caesar?
What's that, Johnnie?
What's that, Johnnie?
The money I bet it was nothing to get it clean, after you made such a fucking big deal ...
Where is this going, Johnnie?
Just admit it, Caesar.
Just admit it, Caesar.
Admit what?
Admit what?
That you overreacted. That you lost it. Not me. It was your mistake.
That's right, I know. I fucking know.
Know what?
Know what?
Open the case!
Open the case!
All right! Where's the key?
All right! Where's the key?
You don't need a key.
How the fuck can I open it?
The same way you did before.
The same way you did before.
What are you talking about?
You don't think I'll do it, do you?
I think you're fucking crazy!
I think you're fucking crazy!
Where is it?
Where is it?
Where's what?
Where's what?
The money!
The money!
Caesar, I don't know what you're thinking here, but if you don't put down that gun --
The next one blows off your dick.
You're a dead man! A fucking dead man!
You're a dead man! A fucking dead man!
Where is it?
We know how this was done, eh?
Yeah, I know.
Caesar? What is this?
Ask Johnnie! Ask your rat-fuck son!
Caesar!
Gino, your son stole this money to set me up and I can prove it. Violet!
No, Gino!
You aim a gun at me?! Do you know who I am?! I am Gino Marzzone. You understand?
Sit down, Gino!
No, Caesar, gimme the gun.
No, Caesar, gimme the gun.
Stay away!
We're family, Caesar.
No!
No!
Gimme the gun.
Gimme the gun.
I can't. I can't.
I can't. I can't.
Give it to me.
We make our own choices, we pay our own prices.
All part of the business.
All part of the business.
All part of the business.
I didn't expect --
What the fuck is going on?
Oh, shit ...
Caesar, this is Corky. Corky, Caesar.
Caesar, this is Corky. Corky, Caesar.
I'm sorry, Christ, I thought ... it's fucking dark in here.
She's doing the work herself.
No shit. Bianchinni hired you? You know he's a good friend of mine. |Family, really.
So, you just got out?
Jesus, Caesar!
Jesus, Caesar!
What? It ain't no big fuckin' deal. I know who Don hires. Did you know he did time himself?
Not bad. What for?
That's none of your goddamn business, Caesar.
That's none of your goddamn business, Caesar.
You're right. You don't have to tell me, if you don't want to. I just hope you understand you're among good people here.
Caesar, I'm leaving.
What? Oh, come on, I didn't use one of the good towels.
Caesar, I'm serious. This is too much. I have to get out of here.
Why? 'Cause you know him?
Caesar, what happened?
It was unbelievable! Un-fucking- believable!
Just look at this mess I got to deal with.
What are you going to do with it?
What are you going to do with it?
I told them to run it through the cycles. But I guess Gino has plans for it because he's coming here tomorrow night to pick this shit up.
Where the hell's the laundry detergent?
Ummm ... in the linen closet.
Fuck! Fuck! How did you ... Awwww goddammit!
I'm sorry. It was an accident.
Don't worry, I'll get some more.
There's no time.
There's no time.
Don't be silly, Caesar. It'll take five minutes.
They were early.
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
They just left, didn't they?
They just left, didn't they?
What are you, drunk?
You mean they weren't up here?
No! They're still on their way.
No! They're still on their way.
That doesn't make any sense.
That doesn't make any sense.
Why?
Why?
Because I just saw Johnnie downstairs.
What?
I was getting out of the car when I saw him in the Mercedes.
I was getting out of the car when I saw him in the Mercedes.
It couldn't have been.
It couldn't have been.
It was him. I'm positive.
It was him. I'm positive.
It's impossible!
It's impossible!
Caesar, I know Johnnie. It was him. I screamed when I saw him. I couldn't believe I missed them. I knew you were going to be upset so I thought I'd apologize and give Gino the Scotch. I honked a couple of times but he didn't stop.
Why? Why would Johnnie do this?
Jesus Christ, Violet! Open your fucking eyes! Johnnie hates me like I hate him!
I hate that little fuck! I hate him! I hate him! I should've done him!
But you know he did it.
But you know he did it.
So what?! So fucking what? Use your head, Violet. The money is gone. Gino is coming here to get it. You think he's going to believe me if I tell him his piss-hole son stole it! Is that what you think? I don't. You know what I think? I think I'm a dead man. I'm one in the brain. That's what I think!

Caesar, what are we going to do?
Got to think this through ...
Caesar, maybe we should run --
Caesar, maybe we should run --
Violet, please!
Violet, please!
I mean it, Caesar, forget Johnnie, forget the money, let's just go now, before it's too late --
I mean it, Caesar, forget Johnnie, forget the money, let's just go now, before it's too late --
Goddammit, Violet! Would you just leave me the fuck alone! Please! Leave! Now!
Goddammit, Violet! Would you just leave me the fuck alone! Please! Leave! Now!
All right, Caesar.
I got it! I know what I got to do! I got to get the money.
The money? The money's gone.
The money? The money's gone.
No. Johnnie's got it. All I got to do is get it back.
No. Johnnie's got it. All I got to do is get it back.
But it could be anywhere.
But it could be anywhere.
He didn't have that much time. He had to pick up Gino. I bet you he's got it with him. I bet it's in the car.
He didn't see you, did he?
No.
No.
See, right now he doesn't know that I know, that's why he put the paper in the case. He wants me to hand the case to Gino. Then there is no doubt it was me. Gino will put a bullet in me himself. But it ain't going to happen. I won't let it! Johnnie ain't going to fuck me! Not like this! No way!

This is insane!
You can't leave.
The hell I can't!
The hell I can't!
I need you ...
I need you ...
Bullshit! You don't need me! You've never needed me! I can't help you! Understand?! I have to get out.
Bullshit! You don't need me! You've never needed me! I can't help you! Understand?! I have to get out.
Violet, I won't let you leave.
If you're not with me, Violet, then I have to assume you're against me.
Caesar, this is crazy.
Caesar, this is crazy.
Maybe it is, maybe it isn't. Maybe you dropped the Scotch by accident. Maybe you didn't.
It would have been so easy to let him in as you went out.
You don't, you can't believe that ...
You don't, you can't believe that ...
I've seen the way he looks at you. He's always wanted you. Maybe two million dollars finally bought you.
All right, Johnnie, you want to play it this way, I can play it this way. You want to know who made a mistake, why don't you open the case.
Caesar ...
Caesar ...
Shut up, Violet! This is between me and Johnnie.
Tell them! Tell them!
For Christ's sake, Johnnie, do what he says.
... maybe three hours.
Caesar, what are you going to do?
Caesar, what are you going to do?
What do you think we're going to do? We have to find the money.
What do you think we're going to do? We have to find the money.
What?
What?
Once we have the money, then none of this ever happened.
Once we have the money, then none of this ever happened.
Caesar, you just killed Gino Marzzone.
Caesar, you just killed Gino Marzzone.
No I didn't. Not if his body disappears and not if the money is still here. Then they never showed up.
No I didn't. Not if his body disappears and not if the money is still here. Then they never showed up.
What happened to them?
What happened to them?
I don't know. We may never know, but I'm going to guess it was a job, maybe the Karpoli family.
Fuck.
Caesar, what are we going to do?
Caesar, what are we going to do?
They're just cops. Stall them as long as you can.
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
Caesar, someone could see us out here.
It's not here, Caesar.
Where, then?
Where, then?
I don't know. it could be anywhere. We don't even know if he was alone. Please, Caesar, we don't have much time. Let's get out of here.
What are you doing?
We're going to need some time.
We're going to need some time.
Who are you going to call?
I can use Johnnie's car, dump it in Lake Michigan ... I need plastic bags ... tape and rope ...
Just hurry.
Where is the money?
Don't tell him --
Don't tell him --
Shut up, Violet!
Shut up, Violet!
He can't kill you --
Violet!
Not until he has the money!
Stupid cunt!
Caesar, stop acting like an asshole and think --

Don't try to tell me what to do.
Don't try to tell me what to do.
You need the money just like we do.
You need the money just like we do.
Shut up, Violet.
Shut up, Violet.
Let us go and we'll make a deal.
What did she do to you?
Everything you couldn't.
I saved you.
Ha! What a load of crap. Look at yourself, Caesar. You're a thug. |You launder money for the mob. You rent women like you rented this apartment.
Saved me? You don't even know me. You used me, Caesar, just like I used you. All part of the business.
You betrayed me!
You betrayed me!
You murdered Gino!
You murdered Gino!
I had to. You made me.
I had to. You made me.
Bullshit, you killed him. Not me. You did it because you couldn't stand the thought of Johnnie fucking you.
Bullshit, you killed him. Not me. You did it because you couldn't stand the thought of Johnnie fucking you.
Shut up!
What?
You're blowing your only chance. Act like I'm Gino.
Holy shit, I don't believe it! We've been going crazy over here, Gino!
Good boy.
We were in a car accident --
They were in a car accident.
They were in a car accident.
But everybody is all right.
But everybody is all right.
They're all fine. Just bruises and shit.
They're all fine. Just bruises and shit.
Now you listen to me, asshole, I know your gun is behind the bar ...
We make a deal or I come out and hand this phone to Mickey.
I'm listening.
I want what's mine, half the money. We get rid of Mickey, no one else dies. No one. Say yes, I understand.
Yes, I understand.
Yes, I understand.
Tell them I'm at St. Mary's off the Kennedy, in the waiting room, but stay on the phone until I come out.
Tell them I'm at St. Mary's off the Kennedy, in the waiting room, but stay on the phone until I come out.
Sure, Gino, sure.
Now that's teamwork.
I should have let him kill you.
I should have let him kill you.
You know he would have done you, too.
You know he would have done you, too.
I knew I couldn't trust you.
Caesar, don't.
What are you going to do, V? Shoot me? Kill me in cold blood? I don't think so. I'll tell you why. If you had it in you to pull that trigger, you would have done it a long time ago. If I was you, I would have killed me the minute I brought the money home. But you didn't and I know why,

Caesar, you don't know shit.
How's it going tonight, fellas?
Pretty good, sir.
Fuck, this happened before. It's this shitty ear. Born with it. The batteries wore out in my aid. I'm sorry.
It's all right, sir.
Not on duty, sorry.
Oh, right.
I'm going to make myself a drink, if that's okay?
Go right ahead, sir.
Try to keep the extra batteries for your aid around.
Good idea.
You planned this whole thing, didn't you?
Where's the fucking money?
You're helping Rajeev?
No. Rajeev's in India.
How many'd you do?
Five.
Good. I hate to worry. I got ulcers.
I should be going.
I should be going.
What? How about a drink?
What? How about a drink?
My brushes, I have to clean my brushes. Thanks, though.
My brushes, I have to clean my brushes. Thanks, though.
Another time.
Another time.
Sure.
Now, where the fuck is my money?
Lick me.
Lick me.
Where is it?
Where is it?
Either pull the trigger or get that thing out of my face.
I'm going to ask you where the money is. Every time you don't give me an answer, I'm going to cut off one finger.
No.
No.
When I reach ten, then I'll start with you.
You can't kill me yet.
Why?
Why?
I could be lying.
Now why don't you go watch some TV or something?
Are you okay, Violet?
Are you okay, Violet?
Mickey, why is Johnnie here? You know how I feel about that fucking psycho.
Caesar, didn't I tell you to get something?
Sure, Mickey. Sure.
Yeah?
Hey, Mickey.
Mick, I know it's late, but there is a problem. They haven't shown up yet.
What? They ain't there?
What? They ain't there?
No. I don't know where they are. I even called over at Johnnie's, but no answer.
No. I don't know where they are. I even called over at Johnnie's, but no answer.
Okay. Let me call around. I'll see what I can do. Don't go anywhere, okay?
Okay. Let me call around. I'll see what I can do. Don't go anywhere, okay?
Okay, sure, Mick.
Okay, sure, Mick.
Caesar, you still got the money?
Yeah, Mick. I've got the money. I'm staring right at it.
Good. Sit tight. I'll call you.
No, Cease. There was no answer.
I thought I heard someone knocking.
I thought I heard someone knocking.
I was buzzing, I was knocking, but I guess you couldn't hear me on account of being in the shower.
I was buzzing, I was knocking, but I guess you couldn't hear me on account of being in the shower.
Yeah, it was Violet's idea. I was so wound up about Gino, she was trying to help me relax.
Yeah, it was Violet's idea. I was so wound up about Gino, she was trying to help me relax.
That Violet is one nice lady. Wish someone would help me relax.
That Violet is one nice lady. Wish someone would help me relax.
Shit, Mick, come on in, let me get you a drink. Sit down, Lou.
We was worried about you, Cease.
Me? Why?
Me? Why?
We went over to Johnnie's place just to check it out and it was busted up, Bad.
I started thinking maybe it's about the money so I call you, but all I get is the busy signal. I figure the phone is off the hook, that's why I come rushing over here.
Oh Christ, the phone ... That was a fucking stupid thing to do, wasn't it?
Oh Christ, the phone ... That was a fucking stupid thing to do, wasn't it?
Hey, if Violet was helping me relax, I'd probably do the same thing.
Cease, can I ask you something?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Why'd you move all the furniture around?
Actually, yeah, she was nervous about Gino coming, wanted everything to look right. You know women, Mick.
Sure, Cease. They make us do stupid things, don't they.
Is that the money?
Yeah, that's it.
Hey, Caesar, where's the key?
The key, yeah, the key's in my pants in the bathroom.
The key, yeah, the key's in my pants in the bathroom.
Fuck it, I don't need the key.
It's Gino! It's Gino!
Where in the hell is he?
Un-fucking-believable. I called those highway patrol dumb fucks.
Ssh! I can't hear Gino!
You got the key?
Oh yeah. Violet!
Call me as soon as you get him.
Leave your phone on the hook.
Hello?
This is the police, ma'am.
We had a report of gunfire, so if you could --
Gunfire? Is this a joke?
No joke, ma'am. Please open the door.
How do I know you are cops?
Ma'am, you have to open the door.
All right.
See? We're for real.
I'm sorry, it's just you hear stories.
I'm sorry, it's just you hear stories.
You did the right thing.
This is a beautiful place.
... thank you.
Hi. My name is Violet. We sort of met in the elevator --
Yeah, sure. I'm Corky.
Yeah, sure. I'm Corky.
I heard you working in here and I just wondered if you'd like a cup of coffee?
Who?
Rajeev, the man who usually works on the building.
Rajeev, the man who usually works on the building.
Oh, he went home to India, but as far as I know he'll be back.
So this is temporary for you?
Pretty much. One day at a time.
I guessed you were straight black.
Good guess.
Mmmm ... thanks, I needed this.
My pleasure ... but to be honest, I did have a slightly ulterior motive here. I was wondering if I could ask a small favor?
My pleasure ... but to be honest, I did have a slightly ulterior motive here. I was wondering if I could ask a small favor?
A favor?
A favor?
Yeah, see, I'm kind of a night person, so I was wondering if it wasn't a terrible inconvenience if you could wait a bit before using power tools.
Yeah, see, I'm kind of a night person, so I was wondering if it wasn't a terrible inconvenience if you could wait a bit before using power tools.
Oh, I'm sorry --
Oh, I'm sorry --
No, it isn't your fault. The walls here are just so thin.
No, it isn't your fault. The walls here are just so thin.
Are they really?
Are they really?
Yes, it really causes problems. Sometimes it's like you're in the same room. But if it's too much trouble, I understand ...
Yes, it really causes problems. Sometimes it's like you're in the same room. But if it's too much trouble, I understand ...
No, no trouble. There's other work to do.
No, no trouble. There's other work to do.
You're doing everything yourself?
You're doing everything yourself?
Yeah.
Yeah.
That is so amazing. I'm in awe of people who can fix things. My dad was like that. We never had anything new. Whenever something broke he would open it up, tinker with it and it would work. His hands were magic.
Truck.
Truck. Of course.
Truck. Of course.

No, but Caesar does. He likes him. Says he's a good Italian.
Caesar is your husband?

Oh no, no. I'm not the marrying kind.
I should be going. You can drop the cup off anytime.
Thanks.
Thanks.
My pleasure.
Oh no. Shit. I didn't know he would call you. God, you must think |I'm a total nuisance.
Not exactly.
Not exactly.
I'm sorry, I usually would call Rajeev, but I didn't know what to do so I called Mr. Bianchinni.
I'm sorry, I usually would call Rajeev, but I didn't know what to do so I called Mr. Bianchinni.
He said you lost something.
He said you lost something.
Yeah, come on in.
I'm sorry, look, forget it. I shouldn't have called...
I told Bianchinni I would take a look. Is it that sink?
Do you have a pot or a bucket?
Sure.
Thank you so much. You have to let me pay you something --
No. Mr. Bianchinni asked me to do it. I did it.
Okay, one drink.
What do you want?
What do you want?
A beer?
A beer?
A beer. Of course.
You seem uncomfortable. Do I make you nervous, Corky?
No.
Curious, maybe.
Curious? That's funny, I'm feeling a bit curious myself right now.
Are you surprised that I know what it is?
Maybe.
Maybe.
I have a tattoo, would you like to see it?
Isn't it obvious? I'm trying to seduce you.
Why?
Why?
Because I want to. I've wanted to since I first saw you in the elevator.
You dropped that earring down the drain on purpose, didn't you?
If I say yes, will you take your hand away?
If I say yes, will you take your hand away?
No.
No.
... yes.
I had to see you.
Look, I don't think this is a good idea.
Look, I don't think this is a good idea.
I wanted to apologize.
I wanted to apologize.
Don't apologize, please. I can't stand women who apologize for wanting sex.
... I needed that.
Tell me about it.
Caesar's Mafia, isn't he?
You have to ask?

Funny, nobody calls it that anymore. Caesar calls it "The |Business."

Work.
We make our own choices and we pay our own prices. I think we're more alike than you want to admit.
What about that guy this morning?
What about that guy this morning?
You mean Shelly?
You mean Shelly?
Don't tell me, you're a workaholic.
Don't tell me, you're a workaholic.
No. Shelly knows what I am. He saw me in a bar with another woman.
No. Shelly knows what I am. He saw me in a bar with another woman.
I suppose he just wants to watch.
Fuck it! I think you better leave.
I think so, too.
Shelly was skimming from the business. He came to see me yesterday because he was afraid Caesar figured it out. He wanted to run but he wanted me to come with him.
Even though he knew about you?
Even though he knew about you?
Yes.
Yes.
He was in love with you, right?
He was in love with you, right?
That's what he told himself. But it wasn't even about me, it was about Caesar. He wanted what Caesar had. That's how they are. I understand them.
For Shelly, taking the money was a way to take from Caesar. He could have run at any time, but he didn't because he didn't want out.
Sounds like he wanted to get caught.
Sounds like he wanted to get caught.
Maybe he did. He would brag to me all the time. He was never afraid of Caesar because he didn't know him. Not like I do.
Caesar lives for these moments. He tells me it's just the business, but I know it's more than that. He likes it. The violence. I'll catch him in the bathroom mirror touching his scars. He says they remind him who he his. They're all like that. Except maybe Mickey.
Mickey?
Mickey?
He's the part of the business that the rest of them pretend to be. |But Mickey doesn't like it like they do. I suppose that's why he's good at it.
I want out. I want a new life. I see what I've been waiting for, but I need you, Corky.
For what?
For what?
You made a choice once. Do you think you would make that same choice again?
You made a choice once. Do you think you would make that same choice again?
What choice?
What choice?
If those quarters fell to the floor, would you still reach up to that cash register?
Caesar is going to get the money and bring --
How much money?
How much money?
Shelly said it was over two million dollars.
Caesar will bring it to the apartment to count and go through |Shelly's books to figure out how he did it.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Do you have any idea what you are saying? You are asking me to help you fuck the mob.
These people are serious, Violet. If you want to know how serious, ask Shelly. They're worse than any cop because they have lots of money and no rules. You fuck them, you've got to do it right.
That's why I need your help. You said you were good.
That's why I need your help. You said you were good.
I am, but ...
All right, let's say for the moment that I believe everything you are saying.
You think I'm lying?
You think I'm lying?
I didn't say that, but since you did, let's say that you are. It would have been easy to set Shelly up. You could have got him killed knowing that Caesar would bring the money to the apartment.
All you would need to keep yourself clean would be someone unconnected, someone like me.
Is that what you think?
Is that what you think?
I'm just making a point. You have no idea what you're asking. How much trust two people need to do something like this.
The difference is, I can have sex with someone I just met, someone I hardly know, but to steal I need to know someone like I know myself.
Do you think you know me like that?
Do you think you know me like that?
I think ...
You said he washed the money?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Then what? Exactly.
Then what? Exactly.
He hung it up.
He hung it up.
What?
What?
To let it dry.
And where is it now?
In his office. I saw it this morning.
It's in a case, on his desk.
Does the case lock?
Yes.
Good.
All right, now, tell me about Johnnie.
Johnnie?
Johnnie?
It sounded like he and Caesar don't like each other.
It sounded like he and Caesar don't like each other.
Like each other? They hate each other.
Like each other? They hate each other.
Why?
Why?
It started way before I was around. I think basically it's because he thinks Johnnie is a complete idiot. But Johnnie runs Chicago because Gino is his father.
It started way before I was around. I think basically it's because he thinks Johnnie is a complete idiot. But Johnnie runs Chicago because Gino is his father.
Who is Gino?
Gino Marzzone.
Marzzone? As in Angelo Marzzone, head of the Marzzone family?
Marzzone? As in Angelo Marzzone, head of the Marzzone family?
That's his brother.
That's his brother.
... shit.
Gino Marzzone is coming tonight to pick up the money?
Yeah.
Yeah.
And Johnnie is his son, that's Johnnie Marzzone?
And Johnnie is his son, that's Johnnie Marzzone?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Sweet Jesus.
Gino Marzzone is coming to your apartment. It's a big deal, isn't it? That means Caesar will be ready. He doesn't want to look like an idiot. Gino has been there before?
Yeah, twice.
Yeah, twice.
What happened?
What happened?
Not much, really. Caesar was nervous, kept cleaning the apartment. |The first time, he picked out the dress he wanted me to wear.
Does Johnnie hit on you?
Johnnie hits on anything in high heels.
Johnnie hits on anything in high heels.
Has Caesar ever seen him?
Has Caesar ever seen him?
He does it right in front of him.
He does it right in front of him.
It's getting better and better. Keep going.
It's getting better and better. Keep going.
Gino doesn't know English, or at least he pretends he doesn't, so he doesn't talk much. He gets right to the point. Both times they talked for about five minutes, had one drink and then they left.

What did Gino drink?
What did Gino drink?
Scotch, Glenlivet. I remember that Caesar made a huge deal about it.
What time did you say they would be there?
The plane is in at seven, so I'd say about eight.
The plane is in at seven, so I'd say about eight.
Any bodyguards?

Gino travels with a big man named Roy. Caesar calls him the driver.
Gino travels with a big man named Roy. Caesar calls him the driver.
Fine.
We want him to come down, to relax, feel in control again.
Poor boy, has to work so hard.
Where will you be?
Waiting in the apartment next door.
And as you do, the bottle will slip from your hands. -- and shatter against the hardwood floor.
An accident.
An accident.
Shit! Oh shit!
What if he sees you?
He won't.
You can't know for certain that he won't see you.
Trust me, Violet.
I'm just asking, what if?
If he does ...
There is no going back.
When I get the Scotch, how do I know you won't take off?
When I get the Scotch, how do I know you won't take off?
The same way I'll know that you went to Scotch. Trust.
I still don't see how I'm going to get clean with the money in the apartment. Everyone will think I did it.
Not Caesar.
Not Caesar.
Why?
Why?
Because of what you are going to tell him. You have to make it as real as you can. The moment you open the door with the Scotch in your hand, you will be covered, and that moment is the most important moment in the plan.
If it's real enough, he'll believe it, because deep down he'll want to.
C! Shit, I'm sorry!
He'll have to run.
If he runs, everyone will assume he took the money.
If he runs, everyone will assume he took the money.
You'll be clean and we'll be rich.
Jesus, that's beautiful.
Thank you.
Thank you.
If you're this goddamn smart, how did you ever get caught?
If you're this goddamn smart, how did you ever get caught?
Every job like this has moments where things don't go so well and everyone starts thinking about their own ass. It's in those moments that everything comes together or falls apart.
I had a partner and she fucked me.
I won't.
I won't.
I think we're going to find out.
It's me.
What happened?
He totally freaked. I've never seen him like this. He's out of his fucking mind.
That's okay, as long as he believes it was Johnnie.
That's okay, as long as he believes it was Johnnie.
Believes it! Jesus, it's driving him crazy. He wants to kill him. I don't know, Corky, I don't know what he is going to do. I'm getting nervous, really nervous.
Believes it! Jesus, it's driving him crazy. He wants to kill him. I don't know, Corky, I don't know what he is going to do. I'm getting nervous, really nervous.
It's all right, Violet. It's working. All we got to do is wait him out and see what he does.
It's all right, Violet. It's working. All we got to do is wait him out and see what he does.
What if he doesn't run?
What if he doesn't run?
That means he probably will kill Johnnie.
That means he probably will kill Johnnie.
Oh, Christ, I got to get out of here!
Oh, Christ, I got to get out of here!
Listen, if he doesn't run, all you have to do is break down, go to your bedroom and pack some things, start crying, saying you love him but you can't do it. You're sorry but you have to leave and just walk out.

okay, all right.
We're almost there, Violet. just hang on.
Oh, thank God.
I'm still here.
I'm still here.
I was so afraid you ...
I was so afraid you ...
You don't quit on me, Violet, and I won't quit on you.
I'm sorry, Corky ...
Don't be sorry. Help me.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
How'd it go?
How'd it go?
I'm here, aren't I?
You know what the difference is between us, Violet?
No.
No.
... Me neither.
Hey, Caesar! You take care of this girl, or I find out!
You are as radiant as ever, Violet.
No, Johnnie. No goddamned phones. Not now.
Pop?
Pop?
Caesar, come here. Sit. We talk now. You too, Johnnie.
Done. We go now.
Jesus Christ, Pop. You got two hours until your plane leaves.
Unbelievable. Can you believe that, Violet?
Hey, Johnnie ...
Johnnie, what did I say?
Pop, this is important to me. It's a simple question. if he would just answer the question, that's the end of it.
You shouldn't have to see this. Why don't you get out of here? Go for a walk.
Caesar wants me to stay.
Caesar wants me to stay.
Don't worry about Caesar. I'll handle Caesar. You just get out of here, okay?
Oh, God.
Caesar? What the fuck time is it?
Mickey? What are you doing here?
Violet, it's Gino and Johnnie. They were in a car accident.
Violet, it's Gino and Johnnie. They were in a car accident.
Oh my God. Was anyone hurt?
Oh my God. Was anyone hurt?
I think everything is okay.
Mickey! Oh God, Mickey!
Violet?
I will never understand it, Mickey. You didn't even call the police.
I told you, the family doesn't want the police around. We want to take care of it ourselves and we will. I'll find him. I swear I will.
I told you, the family doesn't want the police around. We want to take care of it ourselves and we will. I'll find him. I swear I will.

Sure you're going to be okay? I mean, if you're having second thoughts, my offer still stands.
Sure you're going to be okay? I mean, if you're having second thoughts, my offer still stands.
Thanks, Mickey, but I need to get out, you know? Get away from all of this.
Storm clouds are gathering, Ted. It looks like rain and I don't have a thing to wear.
I don't know what we're talking about.
I don't know what we're talking about.
We're talking about Marseille. We're talking about Nykwana Wombosi. And I'm asking you if this abortion in Marseille has anything to do with Treadstone. Was this Treadstone?

You're asking me a direct question?
You're asking me a direct question?
Yes.
Yes.
I thought you were never going to do that.
They're putting together an agency oversight committee. They're going to look through everyone's budgets. Treadstone is a rather sizable line item in my ledger. What am I going to do about that?
You'd want to make that go away. You'd want to remind them that Treadstone is a training organization. That it's all theoretical. You'd want to sign off on that.

And what if I couldn't do that?
And what if I couldn't do that?
Then I'd have to explain Treadstone. And you'd have to explain how you let me get this far. Doesn't sound like much of a Plan-B, does it? We'll clean up the field. You clean up your budgets.
She's a gypsy. If it's a cover, it's a great one.
I'm assuming we're exploring that possibility.

Yes, well, I think we need some fresh eyes on this problem. I'm bringing in some people from upstairs.
We've been down here for two weeks banging our heads against the wall. We've been <u>sleeping</u> down here. We just got our first lead fourteen hours ago, and now? -- now that we <u>finally</u> have something to work with -- you want to bring planning personnel down here? I'd rethink that.
I want a second opinion.

That was two hours -- two hours to get a second opinion -- and nothing changes. He's loose. He's out of control. It's very clear what needs to happen. I have work to do.
What if he <u>is</u> working for someone else? What if he turned?
What if he <u>is</u> working for someone else? What if he turned?
Turn? To who? Where does he turn? What does he have to offer? He's got nothing. He's a killer. He's a piece of equipment for crissake. Where's he gonna turn?
No. We can't risk it.
Our last sighting was forty-eight hours ago. Even if they stayed in the car, the grid is huge. This is it. He's trained -- conditioned -- they're built to disappear. You give him another day to run and we may never find him.

I have some very bad news for you, sir. I'm terrible sorry to have to tell you this, but Monsieur Kane has passed away almost two weeks ago...
There was an accident. On the motorway. Apparently, he was killed instantly. Really, I'm terrible sorry to be the one to tell you this...
...I understand...
...I understand...

Really.
Really.
We thought you were gone for good.
We thought you were gone for good.
Did you?
Did you?
Well, I mean it's a tough business, isn't it? Cutthroat.
Look, our bid -- it was competitive -- but definitely at the high end of competitive -- when we didn't hear back from you, we did some re-analysis of the numbers, and honestly, we'd really like a chance to do a bit better. I'm assuming you're still in the market. It's the same vessel?
Yes.
Yes.
We just picked up a job quite like the one we were bidding for you. Gorgeous boat, hundred-and-seventy- five-foot pleasure cruiser. I think we learned a few things that might allow us to make our proposal for your job, as I said, a bit more competitive.

Was it the break-in?
Excuse me?
Excuse me?
We also thought we hadn't heard from you -- we've had a bit of a publicity nightmare, people have been talking. Our offices were broken into -- vandalism mostly -- shortly after we last spoke.
