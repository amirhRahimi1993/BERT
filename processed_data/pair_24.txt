And you weren't looking into her eyes when she fell. Now drop it!
No, buddy, it was you who dropped it!
If you want, do it. I don't care.
Forget me. If you can, get away.
Would you?
Thanks for staying around when you didn't have to.
My pleasure.
How's your leg? I'll live. Where'd you leave Jessie?
Near Freedom Falls. She went for help.

Room service...Hi, Sarah.
Hi, Gabe.
How're ya feeling?
Fine, I guess...
Fine, I guess...
Sarah, we could take off and leave this guy behind...
She's tough.
Is it really four thousand?
Sarah, tonight why don't you and Hal come over for dinner?
Okay--I don't know about this.
Please, can I think about this for a minute...Okay, I'm sorry, it's fine. What do you want me to do?
Just keep lookin' at me and only think about the distance <u>across</u>. Count it as you go: One, two...by eight you'll be there.

Wait, I think I have them sighted. What's the word, Frank?

Just hangin' out.
Oh, my God! I can't recognize the face, but the butt does look vaguely familiar.
Don't say that. You'll embarrass Frank.

Don't believe it... You know the trouble with you is you have no brain filter. Everything you think just pours right out.
The winds are picking up.
On my way. Alright Sarah, are you ready for the best ride in the park?
Hello, Gabriel.
When you call me Gabriel, I know I've got trouble.

Maybe I can help. Let's see... if one night I got up and packed up all my things and drove away without leaving so much as a note, and stayed away for months, I think what I'd want to do is come up with a well thought-out reason.

I was there, you were the only one who didn't panic. So do everyone a favor, don't hog all the guilt. You held on as long as you could. Yes, everything did go wrong, starting with Hal. I mean, what was he doing up on the Tower with a girl who could barely climb?

You come back after being gone almost a year, and you expect me to just leave... This was <u>our</u> home, now it's <u>my</u> home. I can't leave. You can stay with me, and believe me, I want you to, but to just take off for the wrong reasons, I can't do it. And you shouldn't either.

Jess--you look good.
Thank God you didn't leave. We just got a Mayday. Seven climbers stranded off Comb Bluff. The weather's pouring in fast and Hal's gone up alone.
Hal knows what he's doing.
If he gets up there and the weather gets as bad as it can, they'll never make it down. He needs someone who has emergency medical training and knows every handhold on these peaks.
He doesn't want my help.
He doesn't want my help.
That's not the issue here, those people are. He can't do it alone.

You mean the nerve.
I know you don't want to be responsible for anybody's life anymore, but walk away and you are responsible. Please Gabe, he went up the west ridge. If you go up the south face, you can catch him, no problem--
Can't do it.
Can't do it? I don't believe this. Don't you feel anything?
I only came back for you.
Gabe!?
What are you doing here!?
What are you doing here!?
Looking for Hal. Oh my God, I heard someone kick the door open...you came back.

You got to go back now!

Where's Hal, what's going on?
Before it crashed, they dumped three cases filled with millions. They're using Hal for a bird dog. Once they find the money, Hal's dead. So get on your radio, contact Frank, have him pick you up, then contact the state police, the park police and anything else wearing a badge and tell them to get up here! Do it Jessie.
I can't. The radio's at the bottom of the shaft. But Frank'll be looking for me soon. When he gets here I'll contact everybody from the chopper.

That's no good. It'll be dark soon, there's no other shelter for ten miles. If they show, they'll take you too. Why'd you have to come up here?!

They've got to find shelter soon, and so do we. How are you holding up?
You know me, I'm a night person.
Take off and meet me at Eagle Cave.
What about you?

Don't worry about me, just go.
Man, it costs a fortune to heat this place.
I'm glad you find humor in this. Do you know what people would do for that?

No, actually it was more like mutual attacking.
Why can't things stay the way they are...everything has to change. What we had was perfect.
I don't know. Here, lay down and get some rest. We're going to need it.
Gabe...your arm?
Yeah?
Yeah?
If you're not using your arm, can I borrow it?
If you're not using your arm, can I borrow it?
Sure, just give it back when you're done.
We have to get through to the other side. You up for it?

Nice view, huh?
Breathtaking.
What was God thinking when he built this place?
If we don't get out of here soon we can ask him in person.
Gabe! Are you alright?
No, not really. Throw down a rope.
Can you see light?
Up ahead.
Gabe are you alright?
For the record, whenever you hear me sliding out of control, I'm never alright. When I secure the line, come on up.
No luck?
Next time, date only basketball players.
She's a lyin' bitch!!
Get it!
They'll kill him! He has no idea!
We gotta get out and fire a flare. It's the only chance!
We might be able to go that way.
Forget it. If that charge goes off before we can reach it, this whole damn crevice will slam shut on us. This way.
Pull it apart!
What?
What?
Start pulling it apart! We're climbing down on it.

Hold on! Hold on! Reach up!

There's no "we". There's a me. All I have to do is make it along the north wall to Bitker Ladder. What you're doing is going back down to the station to get help. And don't put on that mad face.

That's exactly what I want you to do.
That's exactly what I want you to do.
What about you?
What do you think? Maybe I could reach the ledge without falling. No, forget it.
Oh, good. For a minute I thought you'd lost your mind.
But maybe with a good start I can hit those hand-holds.
Hand-holds?! I can barely see them.

Can't do it. Now go back and get help!

The faster you find the bags, the bigger you boys' finder's fee will be.
Right, all the bullets we can eat.
He'll freeze.
Ryan, get a rope, I want the man on a leash, too.
What's he doing?
The best he can since you gave him nothing.
Talk. No tricks, no codes, no messages. You haven't found us. It was a fake call.
Jessie, I reached the top of the Tower. So far, no sign of anyone. Looks like a phoney call. Over.
Mr. Travers is not the athletic type, he needs something more direct.
The only faster way up is the East Face and it's smooth as glass. Maybe a dozen guys in the world could do it in good weather, only a psycho would try it in a storm.
Souvenirs? No, wrong answer. Looks like your friend plans on hanging around, that possible?
No, he's gone.
No, he's gone.
No, he's close, and he's using our money to keep you alive. Nobody's worth that much on the open market. Except you, the loyal one. Didn't I tell you to warm the place up?
It's up there, on the Tower.
How far?
For Christ's sake, they're kids.
We're not animals, but don't force us to be. Walk over.
You son of a bitch! You said you wouldn't kill him!
Sue me.
Murdering, motherfucker...
Kill a few people, they call you a murderer. When you kill millions, you're called a conqueror. Go figure. Move on Tucker, time is short.
You said there was a way across.
There is.
He never hurt anybody.
I'm touched. Kristel, check the chopper, let's go.
Travers, you're not running things.
When he finds the money, you're as dead as me.
Tucker, you know where the money is-- I want it.
Qualen, go fuck yourself. The game's over--you lost.
Qualen, go fuck yourself. The game's over--you lost.
No, the goddamn game's not over! It's never over when you're playing against a team that doesn't care if they win or lose-- how do you negotiate with someone like that?!

What are you talking about?
Yeah...
Anyone else following?
What's your names?
Tucker and Walker.
Tucker and Walker.
Tucker and Walker, we've lost three bags.
Have her come up.
The down drafts would wipe her out. It's the only chopper. If it goes, you got no ride out.
On top of the peak.
It looks like a winding route.
He asked you, how far?! I think you've been taking the scenic route. How far from here?
Half a day.
Then where the fuck is!
There. You blind?
Rescue One -- please be advised Ranger Walker is making advances toward my girlfriend that are liable to get his ass kicked right into space, over.
Copy. Hal, tell Gabe he only makes advances <u>to me</u> or else he'll be walking down four thousand feet, and sleeping outside.
Go after her.
Hold on, baby, he'll get you.
Got to be Comb Bluff.
Acknowledge. Winds are too strong to get a chopper up there, Are you near any natural shelter? Over.
You and Frank get the tents, thermal clothing, and medical supplies together.
Who's going with you?
Who's going with you?
You're looking at him.
You're looking at him.
Where's the rest of the team?
Where's the rest of the team?
Bob and Rick are in Denver. I gotta get up there as fast as possible. Frank, get me a load of flares.
You gotta be kidding me! Do you want me to fly up after you? Over.
<u>Negative</u>. The winds are too high. I'm going to ride out the storm here. I'll take shelter in the Douglas Exhibition Shaft. Over and out.
Oh, my God!
Climb, Gabe, climb!
Right.
Then it's a deal.
I don't know about totally.
Who the hell ever is. This is the most protected shipment we've got-- and the most useless. These bills aren't even <u>in</u> circulation; the one thousand dollar bills we're transporting are only used for international banking exchange.

Now I have jurisdiction! I said get your weapons.
Now I have jurisdiction! I said get your weapons.
These are highly trained agents overreacting without just cause.
Calm down...give the gun to me. You're out of control, son.
What the hell are you waiting for, goddammit! Don't you see what he's doing! He's hijacking the shipment!
Travers! Hurry it up.
On my way. The cases are hooked up and ready.
Why didn't you send the money over?
Somehow I didn't think you'd wait for me if I'd sent it first.
What's the delay?
Let's move your ass in there!!
Kill me? Christ we're partners in this!
Were. Give me the tracking monitor!
Were. Give me the tracking monitor!
Why? What are you going to do?!
Why? What are you going to do?!
The monitor! I never ask twice.
Don't use my name!
Ask the questions.
Ask the questions.
You're both with the mountain rescue team?
Where's the third one, Travers?
There, what's that place?
Get off my back, Qualen!
I haven't even got on it yet. Let's go, time to fetch.
Don't give him anything.
We agree on something. And for insurance, take his coat.
I don't trust him.
Kill him when he gets down.
Bring down the money or your friend's dead!
We can't and he knows it.
Man against nature, right Travers.
What about it?
What about it?
Down there you buy a life, up here you earn it or die. How's your health?
This way.
Then go fetch.
He's alive!
He can't be far away. Find him. Go!
Jessie? Looks like your friend found company.
We're down to a few hours before the whole world shows up here. Where's the next one?
Good, Travers. It might catch on, like shooting skeet.
You dumb bastard, you waited too long. If he made it back, this place would have been covered with police in a few hours. The way we're moving, it's going to be anyway.
This is insane. The hell with the money. You radio in for that chopper, understand!
Hey, you dealt us this hand, we're playing it all the way. Move.
Is it set?
Primed to go off right over his head, officer.
Why the hell are we wasting time here?!
Insurance against him finding that last case ahead of us.
What's the code, Travers?
I told you, 50,000 possible keycode combinations, in fifteen second intervals.
I told you, 50,000 possible keycode combinations, in fifteen second intervals.
Give me the fucking code!
You got what we need?
No, that son-of-a-bitch Walker is alive.

There was some sophistos from the TV studios around the corner, laughing an govoreeting. The Devotchka was smecking away, and not caring about the wicked world one bit. Then the disc on the stereo twanged off and out, and in the short silence before the next one came on, she suddenly came with a burst of singing, and it was like for a moment,

Sorry about the pain. Using the gulliver to much like, eh? Giving orders and disciplining and that perhaps, eh? You sure the pain's gone? You sure you'll not be happier back up in bed.
Lets get things nice and sparkling clear. This sarcasm, if I may call it such, does not become you, O my brothers. As I am your droog and leader, I am entitled to know what goes on, eh? Now then, Dim, what does that great big horsy gape of a grin portend?

Dear, dear, dear. Whatever happened to you, my boy? Mr. Alexander, now confined to a wheelchair, pushes himself away from his desk, and rolls up to Julian. The water drips off Alex's clothes. They look at each other.

Then, by God, you have been sent here by providence. Tortured in prison, then thrown out to be tortured by the Police. My heart goes out to you, poor, poor boy. Oh, you are not the first to come here in distress. The Police are fond of bringing their victims to the outskirts of this village. But it is providential that you, who are

You must have an interesting job at a salary which you would regard as adequate. Not only for the job which you are going to do and in compensation for what you believe you have suffered, but also because you are helping us.

Very good, Chief. Chief Guard turns to Alex.
Forward to the white line, toes behind it. Full name and number to the Governor. Chief Guard closes door.
Shut your filthy hole, you scum!!!
You are to be reformed. Tomorrow you go to this man, Brodsky. You wbe leaving here. You will be transferred to the Ludovico Medical Facility. It is believed that you will be able to leave State custody in a little over a fortnight. I suppose that prospect pleases you?

Answer when the Governor asks you a question you filthy young swine!
Don't read it - sign it!
It says that you are willing to have the residue of your sentence commuted to the Ludovico treatment. Alex signs. Governor gathers up papers. Alex dots the last "i" and smiles.
Pitiful rookerful...
And there's Will the English in the Muscleman coffee mesto saying he can fence anything that anything that any malchick tries to crast.

Big, big money.
Moloko-plus.
Something to sharpen us up, you especially. We have the start.
Enough is remembered though, little Alex. Dim and Georgie laugh. They drag Alex to a low water through.
This is to make sure you stay cured. Georgie hits Alex in the stomach with his blackjack. Then, they push his head under the water and methodically start to beat him with their blackjacks. After a full minute of this, they drag him out, halt-drowned,
Yes, I heard. D'you know what time he got in last night?
No I don't know, luv, I'd taken my sleepers.
No I don't know, luv, I'd taken my sleepers.
I wonder where exactly is it he goes to work of evenings.
I wonder where exactly is it he goes to work of evenings.
Well, like he says, it's mostly odd things he does, helping like... here and there, as it might be.
Well, it's a surprise all right, a bit bewildering too.
We've only just read about it in the morning papers.
We've only just read about it in the morning papers.
Aye. You should have let us know, lad, not that we're not very pleased to see you again. All cured too, eh?
Well, what's the matter lad, are you feeling alright?
Dad... It's the treatment. More retching.
D'you think we should do something?
Would you like me to make you a nice cup of tea, son?
Hullo, son, how are you?
Are you feeling better?
How many to a cell?
Four in this block, sir.

Cram criminals together and what do you get - concentrated criminality... crime in the midst of punishment.

I agree, sir. What we need are larger prisons. More money.
I agree, sir. What we need are larger prisons. More money.
Not a chance, my dear fellow. The Ggovernment can't be concerned any longer with outmoded penological theories. Soon we may be needing all of out prison space for political offenders. Common criminals like these are best dealt with on a purely curative basis. Kill the criminal reflex that's all. Full implementation in a year's time. Punishment means nothing to them, you can see that...
Well, fine... we could still look at C-Block.
No, no, no. That's enough. He's perfect. I want his records sent to me. This vicious young hoodlum will be transformed out of all recognition.
Shall we go to my office?
Thank you.

Sure. I'm starting an 800 hotline. Caught part of your phone call. And even if I hadn't, there's the dark pinstripe, Armani, elegant, not too hip, which rules out advertising, plus a top-of-the-line briefcase that you live out of, looks like Bottega...

Dmitri hired him! He's already killed all your witnesses, now he's coming after you! He was stalking you when I dropped you off. I don't know what happened, but he diverted and got into my cab, instead.
Did you say <u>Dmitri?</u> How do you know about my case? I don't understand...
It doesn't matter! Just get out of the goddamn building...

This vehicle's not safe to drive. We're gonna have to impound it. Get you towed. Step away from the vehicle and pop the trunk. I'm sorry, sir, you'll have to find another cab.
Come on, it's been a long, shitty day. How about a break? I'll call a tow truck myself, I swear. I won't budge from this spot.
Save me the grief. Step out of the car, sir, and open the trunk.
You dizzy? You want to sit down?
I'm...fine. Fine.
I'm...fine. Fine.
You sure? You look pretty shaky...
...I was just a young cat back then, about nineteen, bussin' tables in this very place. Didn't pay but shit, but that wasn't the point. Being around the music, that was the thing. And I was. Take this one night...July 22, 1964...who walks in? Mr. Louis Armstrong.

Fella owned this place back then, Dix Dwyer, he let slip to Louis that I played. So Pops, he just waves me right up. My heart about stopped. But I got up there all the same, and we played for nearly twenty minutes.

Unbelievable... ...you hearing this? Unbelievable.
Remember what you played?
Most vividly. "St. Louis Blues," "Potato Head Blues," "Sleepy Time Down South..." ...then Pops laid some "Cornet Chop Suey" on me, and left me in the dust like a whipped dog.

The crowd was most kind. I was born in 1945, but my life began the night of July 22, 1964. That was the moment of my conception. Right here in this very room.
You know Dmitri?
'Fraid so.
And here I was thinking you were such a nice guy.
I am a nice guy, Daniel. With a job to do. You know how it is.
What kind of question?
Jazz question. What other kind is there? You get it right, we roll with it. You disappear. Tonight. You don't go home, you don't pack a bag, you just leave town...and nobody, I mean nobody, ever hears from you or sees you again.

I never lie. Ask Max. Max, have I lied yet?
One more thing. If by some chance I get this wrong...tell Dmitri I'm sorry.
Of course.

I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Sorry?
Tell me, Vincent. Do you believe in Santa Claus?
Can't say that I do.
Can't say that I do.
Neither do I. But my children, they're still young. Do you know who they like even more than jolly old Saint Nicholas? His helper, Black Peter. An old Russian fairy tale tells of how Santa got so busy looking after all the good kids, he had to hire a helper to punish all the bad kids. That was Black Peter's job. He was given

I picked up a tail.
Federal?
Federal?
You tell me. I had to toss the list in the river. I was protecting your sorry, long-winded ass. So why don't you show a little courtesy?
You think I wanted to come here tonight? You think I'm that stupid? Sometimes shit happens, you gotta roll with it.

Wouldn't dream of it.
As a token of my appreciation for your understanding in this matter, I'd like to offer you a discount for my services tonight. Twenty five percent.
Twenty five?

Something going on?
Pretty quiet down there. A cab just pulled up, aside from that...
...goddamn it, you telling me this motherfucker's whacked three of our witnesses tonight...
...Petrov and Cicerno for sure...
Advance team, two men, stick to that goddamn cab, stay in radio contact, the rest of us follow in the van. Nobody moves until the entire team's in place...
Can you fax me his picture? His license or something? What do you mean you don't have that there? Anybody else in the cab?
...got off the phone with his dispatcher. What an asshole. Cabbie's name is Max Rilke, been driving that cab for ten years...
So?
So?
...so, his description of Max the cabdriver matches the guy who walked out of Villa Rodeo. That guy? That guy is a cabbie. And you're telling me this cabbie walks into a phone booth and emerges as a meat eater, assassin with heavy trigger time? What's he do, squeeze 'em in between fares?

No. Your cabbie is floating down a storm drain or stuffed in the trunk of a cab.
Lemme tell you something. Vincent and a few other guys like him are fucking ghosts. Nobody even know what he looked like until now...
I don't know...
What are you gonna do?
Take him down. Save Richard Yip, our witness...

There was a car here, you can see where the glass came down all around it. Ivan flew out the window and went bam.
He could'a been depressed. It still doesn't tell me homicide.
Remember that thing a few years back? That thing with the cab?

Cabbie drove around all night. Three people got killed.

Cabbie had no criminal record, no history of mental illness. Suddenly, he just wigs out and pops three people, then himself? Plus the victims weren't random solid citizens. They were all lowlives. Wiseguys. I've always wondered if there was someone else in the cab.
...yeah, I'm still at Bellevue. The John Doe didn't pan out, but you'll never guess who's lying up in the meat locker.

Max never had many friends. So much with the piano. Always keeping to himself, it's unhealthy...
I'm sure you're very proud of Max.
Of course I'm proud. You know he started with nothing? Look at him today. Playing concerts.
Quite an achievement...

Mind if I time you? What do I get if you're wrong? A free ride?
An apology.
First time in New York?
Third, but I still can't tell uptown from downtown. Tell the truth, whenever I'm here, I can't wait to leave. Place gets to me. Too loud, too fast...too much. You like it here?

No shit. Since he has two .45s double- tapped through the sternum and fell six floors onto his head...
You - you killed him?
No-no, I-I shot him. The bullets and the fall killed him.
You cool, Max? Say "I'm cool."

Chopin prelude. Stodgy, but nice. Here's the deal. I didn't want you involved in this. Still breathing? But now that you are, we have to make the best of it, Max. Improvise. Life is that way. Adapt to your environment. Survive. Darwin. "Shit happens." The I Ching. Whatever. Roll with it.
I Ching? You threw a man out a window!

I'm not catching a melody.
That's the point. You play <u>between</u> the notes, you dance <u>around</u> the structure, you improvise. Some people know where they're going to be ten years from now. Same job, same neighbors, same shit over and over. That's not living. That's dying a little every day. Not me, pal. It's not knowing what's around the corner that makes like worth living.

So why do you keep the picture up? You wish you hadn't quit?
So why do you keep the picture up? You wish you hadn't quit?
Well, I -- Jerry, the point. Get there. What does it have to do with the President?
The President's in Europe. Tomorrow he'll be in Turkey. Right along this fault line. They launched the space shuttle yesterday.
Motive?

He's cutting funding for NASA. The milk cow of the aerospace industry. We're talking billions. Motive enough?

You know, to be 'normal' and live in the 'real world,' to swallow Coca cola and eat Kentucky Fried Chicken, you have to be in a conspiracy <u>against yourself</u>. I can't lie to me, Liza. And the more I strip through the sham, the crazier I look to people like you. Can't you see that's what they're counting on? You want to go out

No.
I better get going.
You don't have to burst in here every time, Jerry. Just call and make an appointment.
What was your horse's name?
Johnny Dancer. You've been in my office ten times. How come you never asked me about that picture before?
Johnny Dancer. You've been in my office ten times. How come you never asked me about that picture before?

I bit the bastard's nose off.
You bit someone's nose off?
You bit someone's nose off?
Yes! Don't let's get into this thing where I have to repeat myself!
It's a man without a nose you want, you dumb complicit sons of bitches! You've got to listen to me.
Put down the gun and I'll take your statement. Okay?
Put down the gun and I'll take your statement. Okay?
You're the boss. Just don't make me repeat myself. I hate that.
What's the charge?
You were there, Jerry. Figure it out.
Just relax.
Switch the charts.
Switch the charts.
What?
Switch 'em. Or I'll be dead by morning. Don't want to be dead.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Hey... I can't control it. It's just, something that happened.
What is?
What is?
Love.
People do have heart attacks.
Sure. You switched the charts, didn't you?
It's okay. The guy traded bullets with some old man in a liquor store. He had it coming.
You expect me to believe what, that someone came in here last night. Gave that guy... something that stopped his heart?

Arf... You gotta help me.

I can't promise you anything.
Lucky guess... Um, I'd feel a lot less naked if we could get outta here.
Don't tell me you're naked back there.
Don't tell me you're naked back there.
Figure of speech. Could we go?
What took so long? You were in there all day.
That's how long it takes to turn a hospital inside out. A lot of people are after you, Jerry.

How long have we known each other, Jerry?

Six months. Eleven days.
Six months. Eleven days.
Till today, I haven't believed a word. Now, I'm curious. Six months, eleven days. I'm going to give you one more hour to impress me. Where to?
You have the right to ask me certain personal questions?
Yeah. I think so.
Nothing scary there. Sorry.
Oh, well, maybe to the untrained eye. Hmm... Ahh... Ooooo...
More about life on Mars. From a rock they <u>found</u> on the South Pole. Explain that one to me. But maybe we should go to Mars and find out? How much do you think that's going to cost?
What is it with you and the space program?
What is it with you and the space program?
And look here. Cease fire in Chechenia. That's good for the banks who lent the government money, but bad for the guys selling them weapons. Listen to this, some gas company in Colorado. Their researchers have been blocked from testing a fuel additive. They've accused the E.P.A. of, quote, 'turning a blind <u>eye</u> to the future.'
Well that's the eye right there. <u>Money</u>. And all the power and misery it brings with it. It's a plot to take over the world. The Master Conspiracy. Can take a lifetime to pull off.
Do they have a secret handshake?
That's it?
I have no idea.
So why are they after you?
I'm not sure. I think I figured something out. It must've been in my newsletter.
I'm not sure. I think I figured something out. It must've been in my newsletter.

You know why the Grateful Dead are always on tour?
Surprise me.

The whole kit and caboodle of 'em are British Intelligence agents. <u>Spies</u>. Jerry Garcia had a double- o rating. Just like James Bond.
You want something to drink?
Um, coffee. If that's okay?
If my universe had a hub...
This would be it?
Equitation.
I've been reading up on it.

'The Space Shuttle's Seismic Secret'. 'The Oliver Stone-George Bush Connection'. Oliver Stone?
'The Space Shuttle's Seismic Secret'. 'The Oliver Stone-George Bush Connection'. Oliver Stone?
Stone is their spokesman. You think if someone really had all that information and a national podium to shout it out from that they'd let him do it? Stone's a disinformation flunky. The face that he's alive says it all.

Can you prove any of this?
Can you prove any of this?
Absolutely not. A good conspiracy is an unprovable conspiracy. If you can figure it out, they screwed it up.
'On July 8, 1979, security forces under control of the Trilateral Commission abducted the fathers of all American Nobel Prize winners. The men, many of them octogenarians, were forced at gunpoint to ejaculate into small plastic bottles. The sperm collected is now under study in a laboratory beneath the headquarters of the Rand Corporation in Santa Monica, California.'

Elaborate on 'they,' okay?
There are all kinds of groups, all kinds of initials. But they're all part of two warring factions. One: families that have held wealth for centuries. They want one thing. Stability. Group Two: the boat rockers. Eisenhower's military industrial complex. They want instability. It's a trillion dollar a year business. When there isn't a hot war, they make a cold one.

Answer me. Was the first time you saw me the first time I saw you? Was it? You've been following me around. Do you see how that could be disconcerting to me? That's not love, Jerry. It's obsession. And it isn't normal and you can't expect me to respond to it and you can't expect me to feel the same way. Can you?

No. That wouldn't be fair. Where are we going, Jerry?
No. That wouldn't be fair. Where are we going, Jerry?
It would be a lot easier for me to show you instead of tell you. But first things first.
What is it?
There's a car following us. Probably another one flanking us the next street over.
We're going to Queens?

I don't know what it was. All I know is I had a gun in my hand, but when I saw you standing with him, I couldn't do it. If that's love, it's not so bad. I found a part of myself that day. I couldn't go back.

To Jonas. I didn't know that at the time. Didn't know who he was. But I knew inside, whoever he was, he'd send someone else. So I started watching your father. I wanted to keep him safe.
Someone else might call it stalking. My dad felt it. He started carrying a gun.
He kept it in the side table in the front hallway. He showed me. I visited a few times. Then one of Jonas's guys visited. When I arrived, your dad was dying.

Because he believed me.
How'd you get the picture?
Your father, he was dying. He was worried about you. He took your picture out to look at it. He called you his baby.
I believe you.
You do?
You got to get out of here. My cell phone's on. Back in the truck.

I'm leaning toward no.
I'm leaning toward no.
That's your option. Ours could be to keep you locked up for a very long time. In case you didn't know it, you're crazy.

A year ago I was leaving work late one night. Two guys tried to mug me. It was horrible. Jerry came out of nowhere. To my rescue. Then he started coming to see me. Could've been a storybook if he wasn't crazy. At first I did my beat to avoid him. But there's something inside Jerry and... Jerry made me see it. <u>He made

What I'm about to tell you is partially documented. The Freedom of Information Act saw to that. But much more of it isn't. For reasons which will soon be regrettably clear, I'm going to share -- secrets -- with you. Repeat any of it and you'll simply bestow the title of 'paranoid' upon yourself.

Dr. Arroway, do you think it's possible you had some kind of... delusional episode.
Is it possible...?
All the elements are there. A woman, orphaned young, under a great deal of stress. The failure of a project she's staked her self-worth and very sense of identity on -- induces a fantasy of reuniting with her 'father in heaven' as it were. Is it possible?
You don't believe it to be... tell me something, Doctor. Why do you think they would go to all this trouble... bring you tens of thousands of light years, and then send you home without a shred of proof? Sort of bad form, wouldn't you say? What was their intent?
I don't know. Ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology.

Dr. Arroway, let me first say --
Mike, because of the Earth's rotation we're only in line with Vega so many hours a day; the only way to get the whole message is to cooperate with other stations. If Dr. Arroway hadn't moved quickly we could have lost key elements.
Okay, fine, they've got the primes -- but if you're right about there being another more significant transmission still to come --
Hope there's a cartoon.
How is that possible? How could all that information be encoded in --
What in the hell...?
It's a hoax. I knew it!
-- Or 'you're our kind of people --'
-- It's extremely unlikely that they had any idea what they were looking at.
Now I remember why I went into theoretical work. Kent.

It's hardly yesterday; the signal's been traveling for over twenty-six years. As for why... I'm hoping your own expertise in decryption algorithms will help us find out -- to see if there's another message buried deeper in the signal.
... could it be a nested code of some sort?
You must have checked the signal for polarization modulation already...
Throw a gray scale on it; standard interpolation.
Rotate 90 degrees counterclock wise.
... Arrangements also have to be made for the V.I.P.s coming in, mostly religious leaders...
What? Why?

The theological ramifications of all this are obvious; the President feels we need to include religious interests rather than alienate them. She's also named Palmer Joss as their liaison; he's requested a meeting with you.

I want you to listen to me, carefully. The minute the implications of this message became clear, this stopped being simply a scientific matter and became a political one -- an extremely complex, extremely volatile one. There are forces at work here you don't understand; I can help you up to a point, but only up to a point.
Are you threatening me?
Are you threatening me?
It's not a threat, Ellie, it's a fact -- if you're not careful, you may find yourself out in the cold very quickly. Play ball. Really. It's good advice.
Ms. President, this is communist paranoia right out of War of the Worlds. There is no reason whatsoever to believe the ETIs intentions are hostile. We pose no threat to them -- it would be like us going out of our way to destroy microbes on a beach in Africa.
Interesting analogy. And how guilty would we feel if we happened to destroy some microbes on a beach in Africa?

I'm asking for your help, David. I want to go. They'll need someone relatively young, unattached -- and probably a scientist. As the President's Science Advisor you have enormous weight... I'm asking if you'll support my candidacy.

Excuse me, I'm late for a meeting.
... Two years is still a hell of a long time -- and as far as we can tell there aren't any provisions in the machine design for storing food, water, even air...
... I can't believe they wouldn't take something as basic as our biological needs into account...
They knew our level of development. If, as you say, they've done this many times they'd be well aware of the implications.
Maybe they are. Maybe this is all part of the package. The building of the machine has demanded international cooperation on an unprecedented scale. Maybe requiring us to come together in this way was, in effect, part of the plan.
You aren't staying?
This... seemed best.
This... seemed best.
Right. Well.
Right. Well.
Good luck, David.
Ellie... we both know that if I was any kind of a man, I never would've entered this race. That I would have told the President straight out: Helen, Eleanor Arroway is naive and strident and an enormous pain in the ass... but she's got more courage and intelligence than the rest of us put together. That more then anyone else on the planet,

It could be anything. The first volume of some Encyclopedia Galactica...
Because you cut it from the budget three years running.
How soon will you be able to decode it?
... And while its function remains, for the moment, a mystery, my best guess is that it represents a transport of some kind.
A transport. So are they coming or are we going?
Mr. Rank's organization represents the point of view of tens of millions of families, Dr. Arroway. Feel free to disagree, but there won't be any suppressing of opinions here today.
Yes -- of course -- all I'm saying is, this message was written in the language of science -- mathematics -- and was clearly intended to be received by scientists. If it had been religious in nature it should have taken the form of a burning bush, or a booming voice from the sky...
What's the status of the decryption effort?
Well --

You've only searched -- what is it, sixteen hundred stars without a peep? Try not to take it too personally.
Thank you, Mr. Sensitive. I'm coming at this wrong... missing something... something...
Okay, let's just slow down. Pull up the starfield signal origin.
It can't be coming from Vega, the system's too young.
Can't we get rid of them?
It's a civilian facility.
I think we just hit the cosmic jackpot.
It's incredibly rich. We've been cataloging it in frames or 'pages'; right now we're on 10,413.
I'll come right to the point, Doctor. Your sending this message all over the world may well be a breach of National Security.
This isn't a person to person call, Mr. Kitz. I don't really think the civilization sending the message intended it just for Americans.

That's terrific, but there's one problem: we don't have the means to receive all the data on our own.

Is that your official response?

I don't have an official response, Michael. All I have are the same questions you have.
There is no direct evidence, no.
And current theory holds that to sustain the sort of wormholes you're talking about, even for a fraction of a second, would require more energy than our sun produces in a year, is that correct?

... life is unspeakably rare. So whenever we do find another civilization, especially one that's... struggling... We send a message. Sometimes we can offer help. Sometimes we can't. But we always try. Life is simply too precious not to.
Can you help us?
Am I one... or many?
The librarian... or the library...?

Once upon a time I was a hell of an engineer. Please, sit, Doctor. I have guests so rarely, it's important to me they feel welcome in my home. Did you know this was once Yeltsin's flying dascha? That dent is where he threw a bottle of vodka at the pilot. At least that's what the people who sold me the plane said...
You live here.
I find it convenient to keep my interests... mobile. Anyway, I've had my fill of life on the ground. After spending much of this century pursuing the evils and pleasures the world has to offer -- after outliving three wives and two children... I find I've had quite enough of planet Earth.

Why don't you come back with me?
Can't. Doctor's orders. The low oxygen/zero gravity environment is the only thing keeping the cancer from eating me alive. It's all right -- I like it here. Ever try sex in zero-G?
Very well. Assume this is true. Assume they have only the best of intentions. Suppose they decide to just step in and solve all our problems for us. You have no objection to them so flagrantly intervening in human affairs?
We've just lived through a century of incredible violence and self- destruction. Do you call it 'interventionist' when you stop a toddler from walking in front of a truck?
I'd say this is slightly different.
Perhaps. But on the off-chance that it is a 'doomsday device' of some kind, I plan to be very far away from your lovely Texas when it is activated.

I agree with Mr. Rank that there are unavoidable religious implications here -- but I don't think it justifies taking an alarmist position.

Very smooth. It's Palmer, right? Where I came from a palmer was a person who cheated at cards. Really though... the Bible describes a God who watches over one tiny world a few thousand years old. I look out there and see a universe of hundreds of billions of galaxies, each with hundreds of billions of stars... I mean burn me for a heretic,
Your 'faith' tells you that the distance a pendulum swings from the vertical can never get bigger, only smaller.
That's not faith, it's physics. The second law of thermodynamics.
And you believe this law with all your heart and soul.
And mind, yes. What are you --

So if I let the pendulum go, when it swings back you wouldn't flinch.
I flinched.
Only a tiny bit. Even the most devout believer is allowed a little doubt.

That's not doubt. That's four hundred years of science fighting a billion years of instinct. I always wondered what you religious types did with your free time.

... It's an old story. I grew up in South Boston, more or less on the streets. By the time I was thirteen I'd tried my first hit of heroin, by fifteen I'd stopped using but I was dealing full-time. By the time I was nineteen I decided I didn't want to live any more, at least not in a world like that. One

Look, I'm a reasonable person, and reasonably intelligent. But this experience went beyond both. For the first time I had to consider the possibility that intellect, as wonderful as it is, is not the only way of comprehending the universe. That it was too small and inadequate a tool to deal with what it was faced with.

You may not believe this... but there's a part of me that wants more than anything to believe in your God. To believe that we're all here for a purpose, that all this... means something. But it's because that part of me wants it so badly that I'm so stubborn about making sure it isn't just self-delusion. Of course I want to know God

I don't consider you the enemy, Ellie. I'm not 'out to get' technology. I only ask the question: Does it have to have all the answers? I look out there and I see so much emptiness... People are so starved for meaning, and it's something they just don't seem to be getting from science.

It's late. We should go back.

An excellent question, Doctor. But what if we don't like the answer?

What if their answer is, 'Oh, that's easy. A thousand years ago our world was in terrible shape, our population out of control, violent crime, no food... so we called a general council and decided to eliminate the anit-social. The weak. The sick. The unwanted. And ever since we've been doing great.'
Ellie... the last time we spoke... I said some things...
I remember. You were indelicate, indiscreet and entirely less than tactful... Sound like anyone you know?
So. The final countdown.
The final countdown.

Oh. I brought you something.
During the crusades -- pilgrims who made the journey to the holy land brought back a palm frond to show they'd actually been there. I thought it sort of made sense that Earth is now your holy land, so...

It's not enough, don't you understand? I know it happened -- but by every standard of science, by every standard I've lived my life by that fact is utterly beside the point. It may be true but it doesn't matter because I can't prove it's real.

Ellie... if you go out there like this -- if you admit to even the possibility that what you experienced didn't actually happen -- I'm afraid they really will crucify you. Please. For your own sake, for the sake of the world... tell them what you know to be the truth. Tell them it really happened.
... but it is a good question, and I suppose I'll always wonder about the answer: Why would they send me back without proof?
Maybe what you experienced can't be reduced to images on a videotape. Maybe they still plan to grant your request, only in their own way, in their own time... Or maybe it's just like you said: ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology.

He's probably a gigolo.
We saw the broads.
Yeah. Did you have them both at once or --
Comin' out here, Boss?
Yeah. Come on out, Luke.
You was eyeballin', Luke. You can't gitcha mind on them weeds if yer eyeballin'...

You gonna get used to wearing them chains aftera while, Luke. But don't you never stop listenin' to them clinkin'. That's gonna remind you of what I been sayin'.
Yeah, they sure do make a lot of cold, hard, noise, Captain.
In the Navy, we used to call guys --
Fasten your flap! All you Newmeats gonna have to shape up fast and hard on this gang. We got rules here an' in order to learn them, you gotta keep your ears open and your mouths shut.
You was to sell your job, maybe this Lucas War Hero would give you a price.
I'll give you fifty cents.
Had it done in Singapore. Bunch of us drunk as coots --
Hey, Tattoo!
Hey, Tattoo!
-- went down to see this old hag and she had needles the size of that cane.
Only two? Man, I already done eight. Nothin' to it. Just make the days and let the weeks and the years make themselves.
I did three hitches in the Navy. It ain't bad. After a while, you get used to it and the time --
That ain't nuthing compared to what we used to do in San Pedro. There was this ensign...
Ah believe I smell me a blonde-haired lady.
You can't do that!
You jes' watch us!

Newmeat looks like a poker player, Drag.
Wouldn't surprise me none. Wicker Man says you got a hundred- twenny and some change in the Captain's safe and you got your five dollars pocket money... That'll buy you a whole fistfull of cards. You in or out?
She looks just like Mrs. Patricia Handy, a married woman... I useta fool with. Man, I kin sniff blondes from a hunnert yards and redheads from a mile and a half.
Drag's been chain-ganging so long he's got a nose like a bloodhound.
Oh, man, did you see her? Did you see her?
I got eyes, don't I? How my not gonna see something like that?
I'm dyin'. I'm dyin'!
Look, she's got paint on her toenails! Oh Lord, whatever I done, don't strike me blind for 'nother couple minutes. Oh you Lucille!
Whatcha got?
Pair'a nines.

'Bout two hours left.
Jus' take it slow, buddy.
What happened? How far did you get?
What happened? How far did you get?
Shut up. Let him eat. Don't pay them no mind, boy.
He ain't eating beans fer lunch.
He's eatin' steak and corn with butter and green beans and...
Looka that! Two of them. Oh my...
I'm dyin'. I'm dyin'.
Lemme see it!
Get away!
Oh lookit that brunette.
Mah baby! We're diggin' and dyin' but our boy Luke is lovin' and flyin'.
Dragline, lemme look at the picture.
What for?
Come on, Drag. Lemme take a look.
It'd go to your coconut head. You'd start getting ideas. Maybe even pass right out.
A cold drink.
A cold drink? You mean one cold drink? To feast yore starvin' fishy l'il eyes on The Picture? A true vision of Paradise itself? With two of the angels right there in plain sight a- friskin' round with mah boy?

A cold drink? Okay?
A cold drink? Okay?
Well --- okay. It's a deal. One cold drink, if'n you please. In advance. One chilly bottle right here in mah hot l'il hand... That goes for the rest of you mullet-heads, too.
That's my baby.
He's gonna be awright.
Somebody say somethin'?
I didn't say nothin', Boss.
I didn't say nothin', Boss.
Well, whatta we got here?
Well, whatta we got here?
A Lucas Jackson.
Oh we got our sources... Tearing the heads off... what was it... gumball machines? What kind of thing is that for a grown man?
Well, you know. Small town, not much to do in the evenings. Mostly it was settling up old scores.
Whatta you so happy about?
I just always did like truck rides.
Plumb busted out. Looks like the hard road finally got to Mister Lucas War Hero.
Back at it in the mornin'. Just need a little nap...
Course not. He ain't in the box 'cause a the joke played on him. He's there 'cause he back sassed a Free Man. They got their rules and we ain't got nothing to do with that. Woulda probably happened to him sooner or later, to a complainer like him. He's gotta learn the rules same as anybody else.
Yeah, those poor old guards need all the help they can get.
Yeah, those poor old guards need all the help they can get.
You tryin' to say somethin'?
Slow down, man. They ain't passing out medals for slinging dirt.
I thought you knew, boy... they sentenced me by the mile.
Man, this here Newmeat parking meter bandit thing what calls itself Luke don't know nuthin' 'bout nuthin'.
But damn if he don't look like a fat old Dragline.
Maybe he's been chain-ganging too long.
Long enough to see redhots come and redhots go.
Lucille? Where do you get that?
That'sa Lucille, you mullet head! Any girl so innocent and built like that gotta be named Lucille.
That'sa Lucille, you mullet head! Any girl so innocent and built like that gotta be named Lucille.

Shut your mouth 'bout my Lucille.
Your Lucille? Man, you better put them glasses back on and take a look at yourself.
Your Lucille? Man, you better put them glasses back on and take a look at yourself.
Boy. You jus' asking to be handled!
Whatta you mean, forget it?
Stop beatin', man. You ain't doin' nobody no good.
I'm gonna kill you, you go on...
That's what you're gonna have to do.
Nuthin'! A handfull of nuthin'! You stupid mullet-head. He beat you with nuthin'! Just like today when he kept coming back at me.
Nuthin' can be a pretty cool hand.
Nuthin' can be a pretty cool hand.
Cool Hand Luke.
Hey, buddy. Take it easy. You're making me look bad.
The man wants speed, let's give it to him. Ram it in and break it off. Go hard. Shag it.
They don't know iff'n to smile, spit or swallow.
They ain't never seen a bull gang before.
Where'd the road go?
That's it. That's the end.
Why'd you have to say fifty? Why not thirty-five or thirty-nine?
Fifty's a nice round number.
Fifty's a nice round number.
Damn, Luke. What's the matter with you? what's the matter with me?
Damn, Luke. What's the matter with you? what's the matter with me?
Nothin' to worry about. We got a deadlock on that mullet.
What did I do? Stole and tole lies. I loved mah neighbor and his wife, but what did I do to deserve this lunatic to come in mah happy home and beat me outa hard earned bread.
We got it locked in the sock.
We got it locked in the sock.
Yeah, I know. But what we gotta do first is stretch that l'il ol' belly of yours -- git it all strained out, in fightin' shape, like a barrage balloon.

Us elephants may be a lil slow, like in makin' love, but you give us a coupla three days to really get with it an' man -- stand back!
Look at Him go. Bam! Bam!
Knock it off, Luke! You cain't talk about Him that way.
Sure do... that's why we didn't bet with the Navy.
Oh, that's mah darlin' Luke. Grins like a baby and bites like a 'gator.
Don't hit me no more, Boss! Don't hit me! I'll do anythin' you say but just don't hit me! Oh Luke. You are an original, you truly are. You really fooled them.
Foolin', Hell! I would have eaten that dirt for them. They coulda used my head for a shovel and a my face for a broom... They just never did get a piece of my mind.

And all the time you was plannin' on runnin' again.
Whoee, it's cold. Wisht I had somethin' to eat. Bread, grits, beans even. Soon's we get to my house, we're gonna have us one big meal and then I'm gonna show you some farm girls that...
We ain't goin' nowhere.
We ain't goin' nowhere.
What you talkin' about, Luke? We're together, you and me, just like always. Now the thing we gotta work out is how to get Koko outa there and then the Terrible Trio be all complete again. Man, this old Free World ain't gonna know which ear to stand on.

Yeah, well, you and Koko kin handle it without me.
Yeah, well, you and Koko kin handle it without me.
What you mean, Luke?
What you mean, Luke?
I've done enough world-shakin' for a while. You do the rest for me. Send me a postcard about it.
But, Luke...
Take it easy, Drag.
Take it easy, Drag.
Luke. Where you goin?
Luke. Where you goin?
On my own.
On my own.
But what am I gonna do all by myself? Oh if'n I hadn't lost mah head. I only had two more years to go. But when I saw you tearin' down with that truck... But you right Luke. We oughta split up. Be safer for us both.
Is that your answer, Old Man? You're a hardcase too, ain't you?
Luke, are you alright?... They got us, boy. They're out there thicker'n flies. Bosses and dogs and sheriffs and more guns than I ever seen in my life. We don't have a chance, Luke... They caught up with me right after we split up and they was aimin' to kill you, Luke. But I got 'em to promise if you give up peaceful, they

Why sure, Luke. I mean I didn't talk to them about that. But why not? They're reasonable, Luke. Hell, we only been gone a coupla hours.

Like I always do?
Like I always do?
Thass right. Just play it...
Dragline gives out the names here. You'll get yours when he figures you out.
Maybe we oughta call you No-Ears. You don't listen much, do you, boy?
Not a liar. You just have a common -- and likable -- tendency toward exaggeration.
He's the champeen hog-gut of this camp. Hell, I seen him eat ten choc'lat bars and seven cold drinks in fifteen minutes. He kin eat busted bottles and rusty nails, any damn thing. If you'd so kindly oblige as to let me cut off your yankee head, he'd even eat that.
Nobody kin eat fifty eggs.
You just said he could eat anything.
You just said he could eat anything.
You ever eat fifty eggs?
Koko, write down their names, don't just make marks.
One rule! No throwing up. He throws up, you forfeit everything.
One rule! No throwing up. He throws up, you forfeit everything.
You ever see mah boy throw up? Shut your mouth and put up your money!
He peels the eggs himself. That's understood.
You jus' may be great at hangin' paper around the big cities, but us country boys is not entirely brainless. When it comes to the law, nothin' is understood.
Thirty-nine... forty... forty-one... forty-two...
Come on, boy, come on, darlin'. You kin do her. Just let that ol' belly sag and enjoy itself. Stay loose, buddy. Eight more, between you and everlasting glory. Little ol' eggs, pigeon eggs, that's all, fish eggs practically.
All right now: get mad at them eggs. Eat it there boy! Bite it! Gnaw on it!
Forty-five.
What's the writing say?
Dear Boys. Playing it cool. Wish you were here. Love, Cool Hand Luke.
Dear Boys. Playing it cool. Wish you were here. Love, Cool Hand Luke.
Oh my. Oh my... Give it back here!
That ole box collapse and fall apart before Luke calls quits.
Your Luke's got more guts than brains.
Oh Lord!
That fool. That damn fool.
That fool. That damn fool.
Oh mah baby Luke.
A bunch. Must be halfa dozen Newmeat.
No more than five. For a cold drink.
No more than five. For a cold drink.

I know he's got a paira kings. He don't have to stick 'em in my ear.
Oh no, man! Not on this hot muther.
All the bears gonna be walking today.
Man Oh Man.
That is one mean lady. Bet her husband spends one day a week shooting milkmen.
Kick a buck.
Damn.
Back a buck.
Kick a buck.
Yeah, found one in this supermarket, keys in the ignition.
Well, how far didya get?
Well, how far didya get?
Fat mile'n a half. Hit this red light, highway patrol pulls up alongside.
Picture's a phoney... Cost me a week's pay.
A phoney? Whatta you mean, a phoney?
But -- but --
That's all there was. Listen. Open your eyes. Stop beatin' it. And stop feedin' off me. Now get out of the way. Give me some air.
Koko, why don't you let one of these Newmeats take your broom for today?
Hell, no. I ain't goin' down in the ditch.
You can't switch 'round jobs, anyway. I figured he knew that.
You can't expect him to learn everything the first day. Hopefully it's taught him a very valuable lesson.
You think you've been working hard. This muther'll break your back.
This is a big day for the guards. They get to remind us who's boss.
One, two, three...
He's gonna lose a finger eating eggs like that.
Stop that.
How about you tryin' to make me?
How about you tryin' to make me?
Oh for...
He'll never make it.
What are you talking about?

He doesn't know when to give in. They'll kill him.

You've been having bad luck with masters, haven't you? Your last one left you when the cops came... and now Luke. You should complain to the S.P.C.A.

You phony creep!
Excuse me, but would you mind explaining why you're watching the lady upstairs?
None of your fucking business.
I hate this...
Only kidding!
Now look what you did.
What did I do?
What did I do?
You threatened to drive her downtown. She has agoraphobia.

Fear of what...
Fear of what...
Open space. She hasn't been out of this apartment in three years. I didn't used to think it was real...
It's good medicine.
A little homeopathic cure for the willies.
Where were you? Don't tell me. It's just under seventy, right? The sun is strong but the air is dry and fresh...
Would you please get your hands off my face, Tallulah? What happened to the newspaper?
I got it myself... I couldn't wait.
Well! Aren't we the daring one? What's morbid and ghastly enough in the news to make Doctor Helen set foot outside her door? The antenna is gone off her car again. I had no music, all the way to the market. Let me find a garage for it?
I've told you: I can't afford to garage it.
Are you kidding? You buy enough gourmet junk every week... most of which <u>rots</u>... to garage a fleet of stretch limos.

I had the dream again. And I got another call. This time he spoke. He said "You and me, you and me."

He whispered, but it was <u>him</u>! I know it was him!
He can't phone you unless the warden gets an okay from you. Did you give him an approval?
Andy? When a three-year-old says there's a monster under the bed, you don't say 'forget it'. You look under the bad. I'm three years old. Call the prison.
Oh God. I'm really crazy.
When was the last time you washed your hair?

Monsieur Andy, disapproves of my coiffure?

Monsieur Andy can <u>smell</u> your coiffure. And guess what else?
Cellulite. What do you say I blindfold you and take you to the gym. Aerobics with housewives...
Andy?
You parked right behind him. The one I noticed earlier. I didn't say anything, I thought he'd leave. Just take a look.
Oh my God! Help! HE'S READING A NEWSPAPER!
Oh my God! Help! HE'S READING A NEWSPAPER!
But earlier, he was staring up here. <u>Please</u>, Andy.

No, dear. You're at your best with a bag in front of your face.
No, dear. You're at your best with a bag in front of your face.
I want to die.

I wouldn't. He'll be back. If you want him. The cute brutal type with handcuffs. Very sexy.
What? What'd I do?
Reminded me that I used to be attractive. That men used to want me...
Reminded me that I used to be attractive. That men used to want me...
You <u>slut</u>! No sexy young cop for you unless you shampoo your hair.
When are you going to call them?
About what?
I can't, Andy.
Then, why don't you just die. I'm going. They'll find your body years later, the old recluse lady, she ate cat food, ten years of the New York Times, unread, piled on top of the unread mail, the TV still on. Make up your mind. Live or die. I'll get coffee.
None of you know anything about it. Now go. And Andy, if you persist in playing doctor, leave, with them.
I'm the only friend you've got, darling, and I don't intend to stop doing what I think is good for us.
I'm the only friend you've got, darling, and I don't intend to stop doing what I think is good for us.
Get out! All of you!
The moon is up, my night to howl. Will you be okay?
Oh, God, I forget. Yes. Yes. You go. Poor thing, you ought to get out.
Oh, God, I forget. Yes. Yes. You go. Poor thing, you ought to get out.
Look out for her. She's tougher than you think.
You're fired.
I know. Do come and meet your guest.
Sorry, Luv. I've got a date.
You've got a date right <u>here</u>, Andy. This has got to...
It's almost six. And guess what? Hall likes me bathed and shaved.
Stop acting like a silly little fag!
You bastard!
But </u>alive</u>!
Where have you <u>been</u>? What happened to your wallet?
Hal has it.
Investigators Halloran and Goetz. I apologize for Goetz, he's a firehouse dog.
I'm okay. I really kind of enjoyed it.
Are you staying long? Shall I shut the door? Make your coffee? Make the beds?
You talked to me. Do you remember?
We'll get the paramedics...
Oh, God, uniforms, more stress. Let her sleep. It's a self-limiting: she hyperventilates till she passes out, then her breathing goes back to normal, and she wakes up singing like a lark. We know, don't we, Princess? Give her a couple of hours. I know about this.
Tell her we're sorry we bothered her.
Hey, no. Leave those here. If you really want her help. I mean if you really do, leave them. Let her see them. I'll see they're safe...
She just got to sleep. Do you have to tell her about it now?
Tell her about <u>what</u>?
Tell her about <u>what</u>?
Gaahhd! What a <u>cop</u>! You busted me! The new one, in the Marina. She has a police radio scanner. It's always on. She turns it off, and then she has to turn it on again. She's obsessed. She can't not listen to it, but she can't listen to it, so she makes me listen to it.
Yes. Without question.
Without question? He only scored 40 percent, four out of ten criteria? Couldn't another expert say he <u>flunked</u> the sexual sadist test? What curve are you marking on, Doctor?

You said, first, he was lying. How do you know that, Doctor?
You said, first, he was lying. How do you know that, Doctor?
Because people who are suffering from aural hallucinations hear voices in both ears. Daryll Lee told me that Joan of Arc always appeared beside him on his left side and spoke softly in his left ear.
He took pains to hide his actions because he knew they were morally wrong. He was not acting on mad impulse. He was sane and acting out a pattern he carefully followed every time.
What pattern was that?
What pattern was that?
The same as the first time...
The first two murders.

You get me out first.

Doesn't work that way. You had your chance, now fuck yourself...

Daryll Lee Cullum, he wrote that book, he wanted the lady to have it. They won't let him send it to her, so I'm getting out, he asks me to deliver it in person, he says, put it on her pillow. It has all about how he tried to kill her.
He told you she was loaded, any- thing you could steal you could keep, Conrad? You bought yourself a return ticket to Quentin, breaking and entering.

I sent it by private courier, he didn't give it to you? That son of a gun...!

I will. I'll call you, Daryll, and talk to you about it after I've read it. Right now I have a question... Peter Kurten.
Kurten! Is he bothering you? I told that son I'd send him what he wanted if he leave you alone.

Listen, you want my advice? Steer clear. He's writing me he's gonna finish 'my unfinished symphony.' He's gonna give me $550 for some of my cum, he says he's in a position to see that I will be immortal if he has some of my spunk. I'm offended. Right away I smell <u>freak</u>.

<u>You</u> thought I was going to do Ted Bundy next, so you sent your partner...
What was that? What am I hearing? The sound of an epiphany, a sudden blinding insight?
It's Daryll Lee Cullum, isn't it?
It's Daryll Lee Cullum, isn't it?
Mm-hmm. I can't get to you. You have to come to me.
Mm-hmm. I can't get to you. You have to come to me.
You know I can't do that.
You know I can't do that.
Oh, I think you will.
For God's sake Peter, leave her out of it. You don't want her, you want me.
I need her; she's a cop. I have to kill a cop, and then...
I need her; she's a cop. I have to kill a cop, and then...
You've been perfect. Don't spoil the symmetry -- you have to have a male cop.
You've been perfect. Don't spoil the symmetry -- you have to have a male cop.
I don't care -- she's a cop. That's the important thing. Cop-ness, not sex-ness. It won't be perfect, but it'll be good.
Yes. I do. I want it to end now. Let her go. I'll come -- just let her go. She's not important.
You know where.
You know where.
Where it began -- McCluskey Auditorium.
Kill me, Peter, do it, now.
No. Not yet.
No. Not yet.
Do it. If that's what all this carnage is about, then do it. Have enough guts to do it.
Do it. If that's what all this carnage is about, then do it. Have enough guts to do it.
Don't talk to me about courage. I know death, what it's like to kill. You're not a killer -- you watched Daryll Lee kill that cop and you didn't make a peep, because you were paralyzed with fear. You chocked. I know something <u>else</u> about you.
We'll keep talking. Until they get here. Then...
I have no life anymore. I ruined your life, make me pay for it.
I have no life anymore. I ruined your life, make me pay for it.
Why did you do that? Didn't you have any idea how hard it was for me, to get that far? I worshipped you. You inspired me. I thought you could understand me the way you understood the others. I knew that about you -- the ones you admired were the great murderers; they fascinated you.

I don't have the talent for any of those things. All I have a talent for is death. And I am one of a kind. What do you think of your student now? I have made you famous, I am your creation and your monument.
Oh, please. I know what's coming, now. "Let me help you..."
Do anything you want to me. I give myself to you. Only put the knife down. Isn't this what you always wanted? I know it's what we all want, to love and to loved. I could love you. You could work together in some safe place, learn to really understand you, help you, give you some peace of mind, some happiness...

Back in the driver's seat again, Doctor? That old dream -- study us to see what makes us sick. So you can find a cure -- they'd name it after you? Death is the only cure for people like me.
Who is this?
Inspector Halloran, Homicide. I'm in charge here.
No, ma'am. This is no joke. And neither is tying up telephone lines to police with crank calls while people in trouble are trying to get through for help.
You're calling me a crank?

Do you have any evidence to report, ma'am? Do you know any of the victims...

If he's not out, why are they here?
If he's not out, why are they here?
Because of your phone calls.
Because of your phone calls.
What calls? I haven't made any calls.
I want to tell you it's a great honor to meet you and talk to you.
You don't admire me. No police admire me. I got one of you killed. Why don't you say right out what you're here for?
You don't admire me. No police admire me. I got one of you killed. Why don't you say right out what you're here for?
<u>You</u> called <u>us</u>, Doctor Hudson.
<u>You</u> called <u>us</u>, Doctor Hudson.
Yes, I did. Poor impulse control. The accounts of the firs two murders made it so clear they were the work of the same man, but you kept announcing they were unrelated. You'll never catch him that way.
Sugar and cream for Goetz; I take mine black. You're absolutely correct. The politicians don't want panic headlines spoiling the Festival of Love.
Well, let's thank God you and Inspector Goetz are on the case, then.

Oh, my God, no! I'm a clinical hysteric, with panic syndrome, and anxiety neurosis, agoraphobic, I'm afraid of everything, real and imaginary. I never leave this apartment now. Nobody ever comes here. I just wanted to get your attention. I write and I used to lecture on these crimes, but... I'm not competent.

Inspector Halloran, that is so much bullshit, you don't like or admire me, but the beautiful part is I don't give a fuck. That's the upside of having a breakdown.

Well, it's a hell of an apartment you got here. I'm living one step away from the projects, myself, but I get to go to work every day, wading in blood and guts. I guess the books you wrote about these sons of bitches paid off pretty good.

How do you know that?
How do you know that?
He felt remorse. He covered her.
The bodies have been carefully arranged... different positions, but somehow the same. The positions are brutal... yet quite... artful. It's like... a signature. He's proud of his accomplishments. There are early Picassos and late Picassos, but you always recognize the hand. He wants us to recognize <u>his</u> hand. I've seen this hand before... what are you hiding?
Nothing.
Nothing.
Where are the stockings he strangled them with?

I sent Andy out on murder missions. For God's sake -- it's the Boston Strangler, Alber deSalvo. He used their own stockings to strangle them. Tied in a bow-knot.
Why imitate a dead serial killer?
If you knew why, you might know where to look for him. I don't envy you this; he's not done -- he's going to do them faster and faster to keep the adrenaline rush. Now, I've done what you asked me.

Work with me.
How do you know that?
Look at the bottom of the screen. You see the icon with the arrow pointing left? Click on that... twice.
Can you make a copy we can show on our computers?
It's too big a file to copy to a disk.
I'm going to put a guard on your door.
One officer already got killed trying to protect me. Please, just take it all away. Leave me alone.

<u>He</u> won't.
We'll show that to...
Show what? It's gone. He wrote a self destruct virus into the code, so it would only play until we try to copy it. Then it erased itself. Gone... Do you remember what you saw?
I am not going to look at any more pictures. They're like a disease. They get into my head. I can't get them out.
I don't look at pictures. I look at the <u>real thing</u>. I don't feel infected.
I don't look at pictures. I look at the <u>real thing</u>. I don't feel infected.

I just came from her... here's what you haven't seen.
She probably let him in the door without a thought. Where are their mothers?! Where are the mothers that are supposed to teach them to be wary and to tough and not afraid to fight?
Look at the sign. 'Hell'? In the Festival of Love? You make any sense in that?
It's <u>anybody</u> connected to author- ity. They write, they even knock on your door. They're <u>fans</u>. It thrills them to flirt with getting caught.
Nobody knows you have anything to do with this case; nothing has been on TV or the news... Why would he want to get in <u>your</u> computer?

Because I'm his damned pin-up girl! His, all of them! They know me. They're in prisons with libraries, they collect clippings, I'm their worthy opponent. You keep my name out of this.
That's amazing. A whole new book, thought up in a minute. Very good. All I know how t do is get up, take a shower, and go to work. Hope, if he does another I'll nail the son of bitch, and they'll spell my name right in the newspaper. Where is Andy going?
He's going home. He slept over because I was a little anxious...

She was killed somewhere else and dumped outdoors in an empty lot. Where it says "no dumping." Her legs pulled apart in a kind of sexual pose. It's all different but it seems so -- the same. Artificial and <u>posed</u>... Something's wrong with it.

You're saying it's the same man, but he's changed his style? That doesn't happen. These men are robotic; the murder is like a ritual. The method itself is part of the pleasure...

Please thank Inspector Goetz for taking care of me last night.
There were needle marks. But no drugs in her blood.
So far nothing they test for comes up positive.
Is that it?
That's exactly... I could have taken that same picture, this morning.
That's not consistent... You said they never changed their style, they're robots...

Ah, if you knew that, you'd be half way to nailing him. Serial killing is irrational and rigid and compulsive. This guy has a plan all thought out, flexible and complex. He's playing a game with us. Who will he imitate next? Maybe he's doing all the serial killers in history, the great innovators, the murderers' hall of fame. Just to prove he's better

What I can't believe is that in an earlier life I slept with him! Christ! Any God that loved his people would give women a rewind on their life and an erase button. Just give me a minute here. The letter is addressed to me... You don't feel fear, do you? You're young. You feel like you'll live forever. How wonderful.

It's also the major piece of evidence, and it makes you a key part of his plan. You can't run away from it anymore. Look at the order he's doing them...

'...great dark hall of fame... all our greatest killers...' His greatest <u>heroes</u>? He wants to be famous. When they're caught and people like me write about them, we give them a kind of immortality. They get thousands of letters. Ramirez kills eight women and gets a hundred marriage proposals a month. They're like film stars.
They get fan letters...
Let's speed up the game plan... call all the living serials to ask if they've had contact with a Peter Kurten. We could use some help on the phones...
They're not talking to me. Saks looks right through me. I ask him for some bodies, for the phones -- he's so encouraging: "you make that <u>your</u> little job." Condescending bastard. Helen, on your lists to call is San Quentin. Daryll Lee Cullum?

What happened to you?!
Ruben's dead. So stupid, a cop thing, a crazy kid and a buncha dumb mistakes... I'm sorry... because you and he...

What does it matter? This guy, you checked your course records, who signed up?
The University computer is down for maintenance, but I've been going through my own notes...
Look. There's the order: you wrote it: DeSalvo, Bianchi & Buono, Berkowitz and Dahmer. It's going to be Dahmer next. Which means he'll kill a man.
Yes. Dahmer! And after that...

Why can't I drive home? I will. You. Look at you. <u>You</u> need a ride home. And you don't even know it.
Well, thanks.
You were the one that talked about moonbikes and called me a crank? Oh God, I <u>am</u>! Make them some coffee. Halloran, is it? Investigator Goetz? I had a crank call myself-- he said... I thought it might be Daryll Lee Cullum. I thought he might be out of prison.
Daryll Lee Cullum? I don't think so. If he's escaped we'd have the National Guard, cops'd be crawling through sewers. You'd have a guard on your front door.
I don't want this. What are they?
You called us, Doctor, if you don't want to look at them here, how about downtown. I'll drive you down...
Somebody is imitating his m.o. Look for a plumber or carpenter or handyman; that's how deSalvo got in the door and caught them off guard.
The Boston Strangler, when was that...?
The Boston Strangler, when was that...?
In the sixties. He's dead -- stabbed to death in prison.
That computer's wired into INTERNET.
He's hacked into her Internet address. He's a hacker.
He's hacked into her Internet address. He's a hacker.
He can get into my computer any time he likes! This is exactly the kind of thing I didn't want to have happen.
It's a game they like to play. Berkowitz -- "Son of Sam" -- hung around the crime scene, talking to the cops. This one's probably watching <u>you</u>, laughing at you.
Let me get a little action started here.
It's gone. The file's not here. What did you do?

But you know how he'll get caught? He'll have an accident, or some cop will get lucky. You can't catch him by being intelligent and working hard. Or the worst: there are
We're through for the night, aren't we? You go on. Get some sleep. I'll stay until we can get a man out here and maybe catch a cab home.
That would be much appreciated. Thanks.
You and MaryJane aren't lovers.
Not yet.
Are you always so bold?
No. I'm shy and I'm selective.
The problem for me is... you're in the witness category. Know what I mean?
Well. Another time, then. I'll be all right. He's not going to attack me; what I' m rally afraid of is all in my own head, Ruben.
Tell me what to do!
I'm falling! I'm going to fall!
Don't let go... I can't breathe... I'll die!
Shhh. It's okay. Just breathe. I'll fix it...
The lock...
I'll get a locksmith.
I'll get a locksmith.
Will you stay? Please? I'm afraid to sleep... I don't want...<u>him</u>...in my head...
It's a woman shot in a car?
Yes. I have to go...

Don't hang up!

Yes.
Is there a phone booth there?

Someone broke into her place last night. It wasn't connected to our case, but it shook her up pretty bad so I haven't...
I was just about to advise the Inspector here not to show Dr. Hudson the note.
Sir, Doctor Hudson and I see a pattern develop...

How come you're so up on Dr. Hudson?
She is a writer, writing best selling books about serial killing. Giving lectures she's well-paid for. Her interests are not the interests of law enforcement.

Okay.
Okay.
We've put a tap on Dr. Hudson's phone. I know you won't mention it.
I was.
I'm over here? What's your name, Officer?
I'm over here? What's your name, Officer?
Michael Johnson.
Michael Johnson.
You touch anything, Mike? Pick up anything? Use the doorknob? I don't want to find your prints on anything later and you tell me you forgot to tell me.

No. I didn't.
Whatever it is, I'm gonna find out and sooner is a hell of lot better than later.
Well, there's something missing in there. There was something around her neck when I came in there, but it's gone now.

Lieutenant Quinn.
What am I wasting my time with this shit for?
Because it's your job, that's all.
Because it's your job, that's all.
Not what I meant; why <u>me</u>?
Not what I meant; why <u>me</u>?
Maybe it's something you did in this life, Nikko...
Working late. You're a damn fool.
Oh, I know.
It's none of my business anymore...
You got that right, Nikko, it's none of your business.
You got that right, Nikko, it's none of your business.
You're shitting ion your career. You outrank hi...
Well, you outranked <u>me</u>, Nikko.
Yeah. And you used that. Used <u>me</u>
Yeah. And you used that. Used <u>me</u>
Don't put yourself down like that. I <u>never</u> used you. I worked my way up like a marine grunt!
Don't put yourself down like that. I <u>never</u> used you. I worked my way up like a marine grunt!
Yeah, you did that too. You earned what you got; don't shit on it, that's all I'm saying.
Yeah, you did that too. You earned what you got; don't shit on it, that's all I'm saying.
God, you're cute when you're mad.
If this is just the dump site, where did he do the job? Where did he pick her up?
Doped up kids all over town. Park was full of them last night. Very easy pickin'. Goetz's type.
Quinn will be here any minute. What are you going to say?
Christ. I didn't lock the fucking drawer! You spend twenty years thinking some perp's gonna whack you... you'll crash your car... but what happens is, you fuck yourself... You can't imagine how many times I saw you two... your head together, I wish him dead. Every time... Want to hear something weird? I feel like I'd give my life to bring him back.

Who gives a fuck? In all the years I never seen you cry. You loved him.
I heard. Good police work.
Just horseshit luck.
Just horseshit luck.
Don't ever forget how good you are.
My third grade teacher at the convent shot better than that.
Yeah, but she had divine guidance.
Answer it.
I'm sure she thinks it is. Aren't you at least interested in which one it is?
You're good enough you'll never have to kill anyone. I joined the cops to save lives, not waste them.
You know, M.J., when I watch you shoot, I realize I've got a little problem with my stance... could you just move over here and critique my legs?
Get Mercer to run the medical, dental, legal bills, laundry and dry cleaning receipts, extermin- ators, mailmen, grocery and drugstore deliveries, handymen, plumbers...
It's mostly done, they got nobody in common, the three of them... No mutual friends -- the Landlady says nobody was ever there, she never saw her with anybody.
Snotty neurotic bitch...
Classy madonna.
Classy madonna.
Sure. She likes <u>you</u>, Rube. She likes the way you move. She sure as hell isn't in love with me.

Tell it to your shrink.
You said you don't give a fuck and that's the beauty of a breakdown? This doesn't look like not giving a fuck, you know that?
Let's get out of here...
You got a tape backup, yeah, here lemme copy it on tape...
Why would he send this to Helen Hudson...
Absolutely.
My promise.
Is Niccoletti <u>assigned</u> here?
Quinn decided we should form a task force -- they're all one case, now. He wants all the senior detectives on it... She wasn't killed here.
She didn't fight back, no hair or skin under her fingernails. I'm not seeing any bruises or contusions...
What about her arms?
What about her arms?
Needle marks, fresh, here. look at this...
She's blue as hell. No marks on her neck. Asphyxiated? not the same -- no ligature marks. Outdoors...
Look at her legs.
Look at her legs.
Spread out like she was sexually assaulted here.
Ruben, my God, I ought to put you on report.
You're right. I can't stand that bastard. Sorry. This is something new. Not the same guy, that's for sure.
You're right. I can't stand that bastard. Sorry. This is something new. Not the same guy, that's for sure.
Yeah, everything's different.
Get the pictures, and casts of footprints.
Look at him, grandstanding...
Now listen up, Ruben. You never, never, never mess with somebody <u>inside</u> the case!
Excuse me? <u>Excuse me</u>?! What do you...
Excuse me? <u>Excuse me</u>?! What do you...
You damn well better start working on that impulse control. A woman who is implicated in this case? Someone who's practically a piece of <u>evidence</u>?

The woman's unstable. You could wind up with a harassment charge. <u>Anything</u>. You're like some horny little teenager.
What's Abba?
Bunch of Swedish women. You're too young.
She wants me to check the phone booth for a note.
Helen... excuse me, we...
The woman was in shock. She was totally out on ranks. I stayed because I didn't want her to wake up alone in a place where she'd just been under attack. Stop that, you son of a bitch! The place wasn't secure. I was doing my goddamn job! And, for the <u>second time</u>, I slept in her living room.
Don't try to lie, Ruben. You don't have the face for it. I need you to help interrogate the burglar in Hudson's place...
Don't try to lie, Ruben. You don't have the face for it. I need you to help interrogate the burglar in Hudson's place...
Talk to Nikko...!
I'll talk to Conrad myself. I'll be in the jail when you wind this up...
I gotta get something to eat, I haven't eaten all day.
You messed with the scene.
Shut up.
I tagged the goddamned stocking. It ain't lost. We're sequestering that evidence. That's the trap some son of a bitch is going to fall into...
Am I in charge of this thing? Or not.
Am I in charge of this thing? Or not.
I said you were...
You didn't say serial killer and I didn't say serial killer.
Right.
Right.
This is the anniversary of the summer of love and your city fathers have declared a Festival of Love. The Mayor and Chamber of Commerce don't want TV announcing killers on the loose.

We're gonna have a bunch of clapped out old hippies blissing on the Grateful Dead! Sleeping in the park, smoking dope and sticking tulips up their ass.
Good.
There was no sperm.

I'm checking out anybody who lives like DeSalvo. Records of arrests for rape, especially by a man wearing green. Checking out psychiatric hospitals for his personality profile. Cross check- ing names from arrests for sexual offenses, public fondling. If they've got a German wife. We can keep cops working on this kind of junk for years, and this guy's going to hit again, soon.

So what have we got?
It's not the same guy. It should be a self-solver. No bow around the neck, left and body outdoors, completely different. The others were housewives, secretaries, he talked his way inside, killed them in their own living room or bed- or bathroom. This one didn't have a husband or a boyfriend, no family, temp waitress, 3 arrests for misdemeanor dope offenses, DUI, asphyxiation probably

Because I think I'm wrong.
M.J., I'm going to have to borrow Ruben. The alien-smuggling thing in Chinatown is going down tomorrow night and Jack's kid got hit by a car. I gotta give Ruben to Nikko.
What does this mean? Now we got the FBI, my team is expendable? I'm working my ass off, is anybody listening? Why Ruben, anyway? He and Nikko don't even get on together...

Nikko?
You want mine, too? You take his, you take mine. I'm the one fucked it up...
So I'm maybe gonna lose three good cops? You fucked up on this occasion, but don't be so hard on yourself. There's something I want you to think about. The book says if you use your gun, use it to kill, that's what it's meant to do. You tried to pick this punk off with fancy shooting, to keep him alive. To what end?
That was Bundy. He killed forty of them, identical, long hair, parted in the middle, alike as Barbie dolls. ...this is hopeless. Let's try to get time for a police spokesman to appear on college radio and TV hookups and broadcast a warning?

She's in no shape to give her statement tonight...
No, she can come in tomorrow... gonna want to know a lot of things...

You messed with the evidence.
Detective Niccoletti?
What's this about the Boston Strangler, M.J.?
Inspector, will you confirm somebody is copying the Boston Strangler? This is the fourth, is that correct?
We're going to review all the evidence carefully before making any statement...
He's not treating her right...
She left you, Nikko. She's not your responsibility. She takes very good care of herself. If she wants to romance the kid, it ain't your business. Your business is to snap out of it.

But of course, I'm Irish. Plus I got <u>real</u> problems. I'm worried I might have to put you in over M.J. There's something going on here, the Commissioner is targeting her now, I can't leave

See, now you've annoyed her. You know she doesn't like you to touch me. Does she, widdle wee fing! Wuhve you so much! Did you feed her?

Poor darling. What can I do about Karen? How can I arrange to have her seduce me? She desperately needs a conquest.
I've been thinking about that, about you and Karen.
There, that's better.
Thank you.
Not a lot of action here.

After being bombarded endlessly by road- safety propaganda, it's almost a relief to have found myself in-an actual accident.
Minute flecks were spattered across the seat and steering wheel. The instrument panel was buckled inwards, cracking the clock and the speedometer dials. The cabin was deformed, and there was dust and glass and plastic flakes everywhere inside. The carpeting was damp and stank of blood and other body and machine fluids.

They're questioning Vaughan about an accident near the airport. Some pedestrian... they think he was run over intentionally.
Vaughan isn't interested in pedestrians.
You'd better drive him. He's a bit shaky. I'll follow in my car. Where is yours?

I don't think we should have come here. I'm surprised the police don't make it more difficult.
Were you badly hurt? I think we saw each other at the hospital. I don't want the car. In fact, I was appalled to find that I have to pay a small fee to have it scrapped.

You haven't told me where we're going.
Haven't I? To the airport, if you could.
The airport? Why? Are you leaving?
Not yet - though not soon enough for some people, I've already found. A death in the doctor's family makes the patients doubly uneasy.

It's much worse now. You noticed that, did you? The day I left the hospital I had the extraordinary feeling that all these cars were gathering for some special reason I didn't understand. There seemed to be ten times as much traffic.

Oh yes. I thought he was a medical photographer, doing some sort of accident research. He wanted every conceivable detail about our crash.

When I first met Vaughan, he was a specialist in international computerized traffic systems. I don't know what he is now.
Is this part of the act or are they really hurt?
I don't know. You can never be sure with Vaughan. This is his show.
Please finish your story.
The junior pathologist at Ashford Hospital. Then the husband of a colleague of mine, then a trainee radiologist, then the service manager at my garage.

And you had sex with all of these men in cars? Only in cars?
And you had sex with all of these men in cars? Only in cars?
Yes. I didn't plan it that way.
Yes. I didn't plan it that way.
And did you fantasize that Vaughan was photographing all these sex acts? As though they were traffic accidents?
And did you fantasize that Vaughan was photographing all these sex acts? As though they were traffic accidents?
Yes. They felt like traffic accidents.
Are we allowed to park here?
No.
No.
I'm sure the police would make an exception in your case.
There's still a patch of blood there on the road. Did you see it?
I saw the blood. It looks like motor oil.

You were the last one I saw just before the accident. Do you remember? We made love.
You were the last one I saw just before the accident. Do you remember? We made love.
Are you still involving me in your crash?
Can you drive?
I can drive.
What is it?
A complimentary ticket for a special stunt-driving exhibition. Definitely not part of the big auto show. There's a map in the packet and a note requesting you be discrete about the location.

Serious. But you'll have to take your new friend, the female crash-test dummy. She dropped it off for you.

You're not jealous, are you? You have to understand... Helen and I had this strange, intense... experience together.
What does he want from you?
Hard to say.
Hard to say.
I'm going to leave now. Do you want a lift?
I'm going to leave now. Do you want a lift?
No, thanks. I'll go with Vaughan.
Crash victim?
Yes.
Why are the police taking this all so seriously?
It's not the police. It's the Department of Transport. Internal politics. It's a joke. They have no idea who we really are
Do you live here? With Seagrave?
I live in my car. This is my workshop.
What exactly is your project, Vaughan? ~ book of crashes? A medical study? A sensational documentary? Global traffic?
It's something we're all intimately involved in: The reshaping of the human body by modern technology.
I've always wanted to drive a crashed car.
You could get your wish at any moment.
You could get your wish at any moment.
No, I mean a crash with a history. Camus' Facel Vega, or Nathaniel Nest's station wagon, Grace Kelly's Rover 3500. Fix it just enough to get it rolling. Don't clean it, don't touch anything else.

Is that why you drive this car? I take it that you see Kennedy's assassination as a special kind of car-crash?
Is that why you drive this car? I take it that you see Kennedy's assassination as a special kind of car-crash?
The case could be made.
It's very... satisfying. I'm not sure I understand why.
It's the future, Ballard, and you're already part of it. For the first time, a benevolent psychopathology beckons towards us. For example, the car crash is a fertilizing rather than a destructive event - a liberation of sexual energy that mediates the sexuality of those who have died with an intensity impossible in any other form. To fully understand that, and to live that...

A crude sci-fi concept that floats on the surface and doesn't threaten anybody. I use it to test the resilience of my potential partners in psychopathology.
He must have driven through a pool of blood. If the police stop you again, they may impound the car while they have the blood analyzed. Vaughan kneels beside him and inspects the smears of blood.
You're right, Ballard. There's an all- night car-wash in the airport service area.
I need to see you, Ballard. I need to talk to you about the project.
Where are you?
Hello, Letitia. I'm Dr. Emlee, and I have some questions to ask you...
I did this already.
I did this already.
It's hospital policy...
I'm the only doctor making rounds this morning.
Well, I don't have hallucinations. Honest.
Well, I don't have hallucinations. Honest.
This doctor, was he tall, with dark hair?

Yeah, and a dimple.
I'm afraid Lhe's not a doctor.

We discourage family visits for the first 48 hours after an emotional trauma like the kind you've experienced.

I don't think you understand. I won't wait.
Do we have to talk about this?
I think in the spirit of group therapy, it's beneficial for each of us to open ourselves up to the others.
The medicine's still bothering me. It feels like I have cotton wrapped around my brain.
We'll see about adjusting the dosage if that doesn't clear in the next How are other things going?
The question, Letty, is how are you feeling?
I miss Beast a lot, too.
I couldn't really say anything because of that fraternizing rule.
Well, Letty, this does present a liability issue for the hospital.

I know Michael's a schizophrenic, and Mrs. Hallstrom's manic- depressive, and John Lockyer has episodes of psychosis, and I heard a rumor that you suffer from delusions of grandeur.

Go ahead and put the guard back up, Letty. But you need to know what you're dealing with.

I don't need a lecture. I care about Michael.
I don't need a lecture. I care about Michael.
Then that's even more reason to listen. Look, schizophrenics tend to withdraw from reality. They experience emotional disturbances that result in personality changes.
Look, I know he's almost through with treatment here. And, he's on medication.
Drugs can help suppress symptoms. But lots of patients stop taking them when they're on their own because the side effects are so harsh. And, Michael's condition is often worsened by periods of stress. He's been in and out of...

I don't want to hear anymore.
First you tell me to do what I want to, then you tell me to stop.
All I want you to do is think about what's best for you. Really think about it.
But what I really can't believe is that I'm starting to actually miss work.
Have you been in contact with the principal about your job?

I thought about calling, but I want to wait until I know when I'll be out.
I thought about calling, but I want to wait until I know when I'll be out.
Then, you should call.
Then, you should call.
What?
What?
I think it's about that time, Letty. The charges against you have been dropped, the drugs have evened out and you seem to be dealing with your life quite well.
I think it's about that time, Letty. The charges against you have been dropped, the drugs have evened out and you seem to be dealing with your life quite well.
Are you saying I'm through with therapy?
So, we'll meet every Tuesday and Friday. And if you have any kind of emergency, you can page me.
OK, good. That's good. Thanks an awful lot for everything, and for coming down here to see me off.

Oh?
What's up with you?
Me? Nothing. Tell me more about the job.
Just go ahead and tell us.
There's nothing to tell.
No, really. Tell me about the promotion.
Well, my theory is that people can really enjoy math, but they lose interest...
She says she won't even come if Dad brings Monica.
Mom won't miss your wedding. She'll come around. I promise she will.
How?
I'll talk to her, and to Dad, too. A few wisely-chosen guilt tactics and they'll be ours.
I'll talk to her, and to Dad, too. A few wisely-chosen guilt tactics and they'll be ours.
Maybe if we had them both to dinner or something.
Maybe.
You always throw the best dinner parties, Letty.
Oh, wait a minute, now I see where you're going.
Please, Letty.
Please, Letty.
Mom and Dad? At dinner together? Are you crazy?
Maybe, though. Maybe it would work. I could throw you an engagement party maybe.
Really?
You know what, Ruthie? I better get back to my class, OK?
And the party?
And the party?
Yeah, it'll be fun.
Where's the old bag I sometimes call Mommy?
She said she'd be here at 10.
What do you think of this one?
I'd have to see it on.
Things have been kind of stressful lately.
But everything's OK?
Yeah, everything's under control.
What about the engagement party?

Everything's ready for tomorrow night--except the artillery.
Everything's ready for tomorrow night--except the artillery.
Thanks so much for planning it, Letty. Jake's really looking forward to it.
What about this one?
You look beautiful.
You look beautiful.
Really?
Really?
Truly.
Hi, Mom.
Look, Mom, I think I've found the dress.
Go on, Letty. I want to see it on you.
Do you think I should?
How can I help?
Paul, can you hand me the olives? Ruth, I need you to, what was it?
Paul, can you hand me the olives? Ruth, I need you to, what was it?
What about the souffle? Has that gone in?
Fuck me.
What's the matter?
What's all the dreck?
Sage, rosemary... Les Herbes.
Sage, rosemary... Les Herbes.
It'll be fine.
It'll be fine.
No, no. They've got to be Puglia olives, packed in a light brine with a flavor that doesn't overpower the palate.
Letty, dinner's almost ready. The souffle...
I'll be back before you can say souffle.
I can't believe you finally gave me the shirt.
Loaned you. And it's only 'til you get out of here.
Loaned you. And it's only 'til you get out of here.
That settles it. I'm never leaving.
That settles it. I'm never leaving.
I can hardly wait 'til you're free. Planning the wedding without you has been a disaster.

You're slowing.
You're slowing.
Mom and I fought for 20 minutes over whether we should go with ecru invitations or brilliant white.
What do you think?
Ecru.
Ecru.
And then the gold scroll or the black Romanesque print?
Do we have to talk wedding details?
Oh, no, of course not.
What's his name, Letty?
I didn't say...
I don't think people even noticed. I thought the ceremony was perfect.
That's thanks to all your help.
You did the right thing.
I ruined your wedding night.
Oh, Ruthie, what am I going to do?
You don't have to make any decisions tonight.
You don't have to make any decisions tonight.
But what am I going to do?

Do you want to go see him? I'll take you if you want to go.
Do you want to go see him? I'll take you if you want to go.
I can't. I can't see him there.
I was so sure. I really thought it would work. We have plans, Ruth.
I know. I know.
How wonderful, darling. What does that mean for you?
I'll be running it three days a week, and...
I'll be running it three days a week, and...
Will you get time off to do that?
Will you get time off to do that?
Not now, but maybe later, if they like the program.
Are you sure, Dear?
Come on.
My goodness. A wedding. My goodness.
Wow. Congratulations.
Tell us every detail.
You've only known Jake a few months.
Has Paul heard about his promotion?
No, not yet. But you know Paul. He's sure to get it.
Oh no.
Paul could pop the question at any time.
Paul could pop the question at any time.
Mom, please.
Mom, please.
Especially with a promotion in the offing.
I gather he's late as usual.
Can I get you a glass of champagne?
I'm here, Sweetheart. I'm here. It's going to be OK.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Oh, Letty, what happened?
Oh, Letty, what happened?
Mom, I was there, and I just, I was so... They didn't have the olives, and I, I got so upset. I don't know how it happened.

Everyone says it's the best facility in the area for this sort of thing.
Everyone says it's the best facility in the area for this sort of thing.
I just want to go home. Can we go home now?
Maybe I should talk about this with Ruth, or Paul.
We all agree with the doctor, Dear. He thinks it's safer for you to stay here for a while.
Yes.
But what about Beast? Who'll...?
But what about Beast? Who'll...?
Ruth's already taken him home.
Ruth's already taken him home.
And my class. It'll be hard to find a good substitute. And what about my math program?
And my class. It'll be hard to find a good substitute. And what about my math program?
Paul said he'd call the school. And your father thinks he's convinced the guard not to press charges as long as you get help.
I'll see you soon.
Tomorrow?
Tomorrow?
As soon as Dr. Emlee says.
It's so good to see you, Sweetheart.
You too, Mom.
You too, Mom.
You're looking good. A little thin, but good.
Which flowers did you order?
We haven't. I wanted to talk that over with you, too.
We haven't. I wanted to talk that over with you, too.
Oh, OK, well, better to choose the table cloths first anyway.
Oh, OK, well, better to choose the table cloths first anyway.
I was thinking either the peach moire or cream damask.
We aren't allowed to wear jewelry in here, Mom.
Just think, pretty soon, we'll be doing all these wedding preparations for you. Of course, if that's what you still want. Ruthie told me some silly story about a crush on some boy here.
I haven't had a crush since I was
When did you start smoking?
I hear this Michael fellow is schizophrenic.
Mom, please.
Mom, please.
Don't forget that Paul's a promising young attorney who loves you very much...
Don't forget that Paul's a promising young attorney who loves you very much...
Mom, look, if I want to dump Paul, I'll dump him. If I want to screw Michael or live with him or marry him, then I'll do that.
I'm only looking out for you.
And if I want to smoke, I'll fucking smoke.
Must you walk so quickly?
It's good exercise, Mom.
I'm so thankful you'll be leaving next week. If you want me to pick you up, I will.
I've already made arrangements.
Mom, we agreed. You can visit, but you're not allowed to mention Michael.
Not even if it's something positive?
Honestly, Letty.
A deal's a deal.
Michael just got a job. Couldn't you congratulate him?
I will, Dear. I promise. Why McDonald's?
I will, Dear. I promise. Why McDonald's?
He's been looking everywhere for weeks, Mom. It's not that easy after you've been locked away.
I'm going to take that as an honest effort at being open minded.
Don't be fresh.
Don't be fresh.
Just remember that I love him.
I'm really not that hungry.
Just eat whatever you want. This will give you a chance to meet some people.
Letty, you should be in bed.
There's a spider in my room.
There's a spider in my room.
Yeah?
Yeah?
It's got a green dot on its back. I can't go to sleep with it watching me.
It's got a green dot on its back. I can't go to sleep with it watching me.
Sounds awful. I guess we better check it out.
It had this red spot on its back.
Green spot.
Green spot.
Mottled really. Green and red.
I don't know why you feel you have to lie, Letty.
Lie?
Lie?
If you feel lonely, or need to talk, all you have to do is say so.
If you feel lonely, or need to talk, all you have to do is say so.
To talk? Well, OK, that might be good.
To talk? Well, OK, that might be good.
I understand you just got engaged. Maybe that's where we should start.
I don't mean to go on and on like this.
It's OK. It's good to let it out.
You can only do what feels best to you now.
I guess so. I think that's right.
You've been so great. I just feel a lot clearer about things.
I'm glad.
Do you mind if I call you Letitia?
Letty.
Letty.
First off, Letty, can you tell me where you are?
First off, Letty, can you tell me where you are?
I answered these questions last night.

I know this can be a real drag, but the attending physician on day shift is required to do his own prelim exam when a patient is admitted during the night.
No, 79. Sorry, this makes me nervous.
It's OK. It's not a pass-fail kind of thing.
Chair, cup and ball.
Terrific.
Let me shift gears here a minute... Do you ever hear voices that other people don't hear or see things they don't?
No.
No.
What about patterns? Do you find yourself checking and re-checking locks? Or washing your hands over and over again?
Yes? Go right ahead.
Sometimes my food, and my clothes, and my underwear.
How do you sort it--by lace and cotton?
By color.
By color.
What if it's got a pattern?
What if it's got a pattern?
Is this really important? Because I don't think it's a problem.
A while, I guess.
That must be really difficult.

My Grandma Rosa says that some trees get planted in rich top soil, and they grow right up to the sun, tall and straight. Other trees, they start as seeds in the crevices between rocks so they have to twist and bend to reach the light. But even though they end up crooked, they're still trees, just like the straight ones.
Why in the world did you let me start talking in metaphors? That's no way for us to break up.

Sounds good. Oh, and Letty?
Yeah?
Yeah?
You've got one hell of a great body.
Gosh, Letty, this is a great place.
Thanks.
This must be Beast.
That's Mr. Beast to you.
I bombed. It's either work in the office or nothing.
Sounds grim.
Sounds grim.
Yeah. How was the job search?
Who ever said sanity was fun?
It doesn't matter. It'll work out.

Big restaurant interview tomorrow.
Four interviews. Four no-gos.
The restaurant, too?
The restaurant, too?
I couldn't even face that one.
That's OK. We can call and reschedule in the morning.
You don't have to take care of me, you know.
Just promise you'll love me even if I end up in a job where I have to wear a blue polyester cap.
I think you know I'd love you even more in a blue polyester cap.
You're going to miss the Top Ten.
Coming.
Hey, Letty. Mrs. Mayer.
I got worried. Are you OK?
How may I help you?
Congratulations.
Aunt Lily is the one who married your father's cousin?
No, that's Aunt Connie. Lily is the one who looks like a hooker.
No, that's Aunt Connie. Lily is the one who looks like a hooker.
Oh. And, Harry, he's the one who likes magic?
Oh. And, Harry, he's the one who likes magic?
You don't have to know all this by Saturday. It took me years.
Aunt Lily?
Bingo.
Something like that.
When he could get time off from the restaurant business.

How about a dance?
Bye, Uncle Cort. What's with the lie?
It wasn't exactly a lie.
What is it? Are you OK?
Always the drugs.
Always the drugs.
What?
What?
I saw you talking to my Mom.
I saw you talking to my Mom.
We both talked to her, Michael. And your dad.
What do you mean not taking your meds?
Why'd you tell?
Why'd you tell?
I didn't talk to her about medications, Michael. Don't be silly.
Silly? Silly am I?
Michael, take it easy.
Michael, take it easy.
Silly, silly, silly.
Silly, silly, silly.
I think I should call someone.
Don't upset my Mom. Don't you upset my Mom.
Michael, calm down. Please. It's OK.
I guess we need to talk.
I guess so.
I guess so.
It's hard to know where to start.
I sure know what that feels like.
And all the plans we have.
And all the plans we have.
Yeah, the plans.
I've been thinking I could try to visit you at night after work, and then there'd be more time on weekends to see...
Letty, please.
Like I've told you before I don't want you taking care of me.
Someone has to take care of you right now, Michael. You tore up the apartment. You stopped taking your medications.
Someone has to take care of you right now, Michael. You tore up the apartment. You stopped taking your medications.
But that wasn't me. I didn't mean to do that.
But that wasn't me. I didn't mean to do that.
Well then why'd it happen?
Well then why'd it happen?
I don't know. I don't fucking know.
I'm sorry. I didn't come here to blame you.
I didn't mean for any of this to happen.
I didn't mean for any of this to happen.
Oh, God, Michael, I know. Why does everything have to be so hard?
What are we going to do?
What do you want to do?
What do you want to do?
I know I don't want to lose you. I don't think I could stand it.
I love you so much.
I love you too, Letty. I love you, too.
Maybe we could just run away to Tahiti and live on the beach.
That's the best idea I've heard in a long time.
Don't you have a magic trick or something to make this easier?
How about something better? Like a kiss.
Would that really be such a good idea for either of us?
Just promise me you'll be OK, OK?
Just promise me you'll be OK, OK?
I will. And you make sure you take care of yourself.
I guess I should go now.
You should go.
So, another one bites the dust.
It's not another one. It's my sister. Aren't you happy for her?
It's not another one. It's my sister. Aren't you happy for her?
She's only known the guy a few months.
Can I put these here for tonight?
In there's better. It's kind of romantic, don't you think?
In there's better. It's kind of romantic, don't you think?
I really think if you're going to spend your life with someone you want to know them pretty damn well.
Believe me, I know your feelings on the matter.
The receptionist said you called earlier about something.
My math program. The Superintendent said he'd fund it.
Good going. I knew you could do it.
Yeah?
Huntley told me today that if I come through on the Benton deposition, they may consider me for senior associate.
I was thinking dinner on Friday with James and Meg at the Saint Mark.
I mean tonight.
Actually, I need to review the deposition questions tonight. Maybe tomorrow?
Oh, ok. Maybe.
Oh, ok. Maybe.
But I thought if you don't mind, you could listen and see how I come across?
But I thought if you don't mind, you could listen and see how I come across?
Sure. Of course.
What are you doing? You're going to be late.
I'm calling in sick.
You don't have a fever.
I don't feel like going to work today.
I don't feel like going to work today.
Won't it be hard for them to get a substitute this late?
But what about that math project?
Paul, I just can't go. Is that OK with you or am I committing some horrible crime?
Paul, I just can't go. Is that OK with you or am I committing some horrible crime?
Forget I asked.
Forget I asked.
I'm sorry. I'm just...I'm so tired lately.
I'm sorry. I'm just...I'm so tired lately.
Maybe you ought to see a doctor.
Maybe you ought to see a doctor.
No, it's not like that.
It's just I've got those parent conferences, and I'm supposed to set up the math program by next week. And shopping for Ruth's dress and that, that engagement dinner.
You can get out of the dinner.
You can get out of the dinner.
No, I can't. I've already convinced both Mom and Dad to come.
No, I can't. I've already convinced both Mom and Dad to come.
Come on, Letty. It'll get done.
I don't think so.
Of course it will. Remember the big talent show you planned last year? And what about the Christmas benefit when Santa canceled at the last minute? But you still pulled it off.
Of course it will. Remember the big talent show you planned last year? And what about the Christmas benefit when Santa canceled at the last minute? But you still pulled it off.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You just need to get more organized. L
You know what I think we need? Martinis. How about martinis to celebrate?
Yes.
What are you doing?
Can you loan me a 20?
Can you loan me a 20?
Sure. Why?
Sure. Why?
I'm going to the store.
I'm going to the store.
I think you're overreacting.
It's prettier here than I thought it would be.
Yeah, I guess it's all right.
Yeah, I guess it's all right.
Are you all right?
Are you all right?
That's a big question.
That's a big question.
I hope it wasn't something I did.

Something you did?
Of course not, no. Is that why you're here?
I think we need to talk about some things.

Yes, I suppose so.
Yes, I suppose so.
This has been really difficult, this whole thing.
No.
Especially this last year.
Especially this last year.
Especially now.
Especially now.
So, I've been thinking a lot...
I talked to Ruth a little bit, and I think it's about time...
I know. We can't just keep going through the motions.
I know. We can't just keep going through the motions.
Exactly. It's time to make decisions.
Exactly. It's time to make decisions.
You don't have to say anything else. I've known for a while that this was coming.
You don't have to say anything else. I've known for a while that this was coming.
I just wish we'd done it sooner.
I had to smuggle it in here. I guess you're not really supposed to have jewelry.
Or be up past ten or fraternize with other patients.

It's, it's really nice, Paul.
No, you've done a perfect job.
So, what do you say, Let?
Sure. We'll save the formal announcement for when you're out. I already told your mother. I hope you don't mind.
No, no.
No, no.
So will you?
So will you?
Of course. Yes. I will. I do.
What's so urgent? You've got me worried.
I need to tell you something, and I'm not sure how.
You can tell me anything. Do you want to postpone the wedding? Is it too much pressure?
No...
No...
That's a load off my mind.
You what?
I don't mean to hurt you. I know this is a terrible thing. And I have really loved you.
I don't mean to hurt you. I know this is a terrible thing. And I have really loved you.
Whoa. Whoa. Have really loved me? Letty, it's natural to be nervous. But we're going to work through our problems.

Have you been seeing another teacher?

It's a doctor, isn't it? That's unethical. I'll have him rung up on malpractice charges so fast his head will spin.
It's a doctor, isn't it? That's unethical. I'll have him rung up on malpractice charges so fast his head will spin.
He's a patient here.
Of all the crazy things. I understood when you dropped out of law school. And during this whole mess, I've tried to be supportive. But, really, Letty, what can you be thinking?
I love him.
I love him.
You're going to throw away our life together for some shared experience with a looney-tune that you misguidedly think is love?
You're going to throw away our life together for some shared experience with a looney-tune that you misguidedly think is love?
Here's the ring.

No way. You keep the ring. You'll come to your senses.
I'm glad you agreed to see me.
I'm just glad there aren't any hard feelings.

Oh, none. None. I completely understand what was going on.

I heard your friend was back in the hospital.

Michael. Yes.
Our relationship meant a lot to me, too, Paul. But it's over. And Michael being in the hospital doesn't really change things.
I think I've heard this speech before.
I think I've heard this speech before.
I'm really sorry.
I've got a deposition that I really need to get cracking on, so if you don't mind...
Sure, I understand.
The Superintendent was just getting ready to leave.
I do apologize. A student had a crisis.
Well, I understand. I know my behavior was poor.
So, in light of how the parents feel, and the fact the students are doing so well with the substitute, I don't think I can put you back in the classroom just yet.

I'm glad you're doing well.

I've already thought about how to tell the kids where I was.
It's a very nice letter. But I have to go with what's best for the students.
What does that mean?

I need someone to work on budget projections.

Mrs. Hallstrom, why don't you join my family for dinner. You'll love my Grandma Rosa.
That's so sweet, Michael. But, really, I've so many things to do.
We're talking Matisse, Renoir, Monet. We know for sure they replaced Van Gogh's "Vase with twelve sunflowers" last week with a copy. It was on loan from the London National Gallery and they're not going to be very happy when they find out about it.
So Bastaldi makes a deal with the Feds to trade up for his brother?
So Bastaldi makes a deal with the Feds to trade up for his brother?
Yeah. He delivers the goods on Zammito. If we got what we wanted we'd let his brother go providing he tells us where the Van Gogh and the other paintings are.

Yeah. I figured I'd be hearing from you.

Too many people know about my involvement in this.
Then we just have to make sure everyone who knows can't say anything.

Thank you Marcel, for that... extremely redundant explanation.
C'mon, Laurant, America?

The job is worth about two million euros. Pull this off and you and your crew could make some real money, Daniel. You leave tomorrow.
I thought I would accompany you to the airport to say bon voyage... and tell you that Marcel will be going with you.
What?

This is a considerable move up for you, Daniel. The temptation of having so much money might be too much for you.

We've got a lot of people looking for us. We'd just like to go home.
We've got a lot of people looking for us. We'd just like to go home.
You want me to help you get out of the country?
And for my help I would get what?
Half the tapes.
Half the tapes.
And the other half?
And the other half?
I'll destroy them when we get back to Paris.
I'll destroy them when we get back to Paris.
I only have your word for that.
I only have your word for that.
I just want to get my people home. I know who you are and what you could do to me if I don't honor my word.
I just want to get my people home. I know who you are and what you could do to me if I don't honor my word.
Where are you staying?
I only ask so I can call you when the arrangements are made.
How about if I call you?
This plane will take you to Canada. From there you can fly back to Paris.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You have something for me?
Tonight?
I know they won't be home tonight.
I don't know.
If you think because you're a women this can't go hard on you, think again.
For what?
Laurant and Vincent were in business with Zammito.
Laurant and Vincent were in business with Zammito.
What kind of business?
What kind of business?
Black market art. Zammito got to a few key security guards at the Metropolitan Museum. The Bastaldi's supplied the artists to make copies of famous works. They'd switch the paintings, send the originals to Paris and the Bastaldi's would sell them to private collectors.
You know what makes a good get away driver? Being able to get away!
You're always pointing out my negative qualities. My analyst says positive reinforcement is a much more productive way of relating with people.
Not a good idea. Someone gets a license number and it all leads back to you. Raymond, you'll steal one.
No problem.
Yeah. We just go home.
We can't.
We can't.
I agree with Marcel. I say we go to the airport and get on a plane.
No one has mentioned the part of the plan about us getting caught and going to prison.
We're leaving. Raymond get the bag.
Forget the money! We've got bigger problems than the money right now.
She probably hid it at her place. The six of us could find it in --
Why not just steal another one?
Too risky. We don't need to get pulled over because of a stolen car.
Get that, will you?
Why do I always have to answer the phone?
Why do I always have to answer the phone?
Because you're the closest.
Because you're the closest.
I'm not any closer than you are.
Why is everything an argument with you?
I'm just setting my boundaries.
Raymond, grab the tapes. We're leaving!
Why do I have to pick up the tapes.
Why do I have to pick up the tapes.
Jesus!
In English. Sami doesn't speak French.
Where are you from?
Hopefully no one.
No one? Then why is Zero here?
I just want you there in case there's trouble.
And if there is, then Zero can kill someone?
And if there is, then Zero can kill someone?
We'll see.
He said to go fuck yourself.
We are tired and bored with your bullshit. So, put that stupid little knife away before Zero shoves it up your ass.
We are being watched. Daniel grabs the binoculars and looks.
Cops?
Bastaldi's dead. He is fuckin' dead!
You want Zero to kill him?
You want Zero to kill him?
I'm going to kill him myself!
I'm going to kill him myself!
What about the money?
Bring me the scissors.
And the Vodka.
Cut his pants up the leg to the groin.
And be careful when you get near the top. Zero has a very long one.
Turn on the flashlight.
I'm trying. It doesn't work.
Do they come with batteries?
You didn't buy batteries?
You didn't buy batteries?
I thought they came with batteries.
I thought they came with batteries.
I can't believe you didn't check.
I can't believe you didn't check.
I bought everything you put on the list. Gloves. Pen knives. Flashlight. Batteries were not on the list.
I bought everything you put on the list. Gloves. Pen knives. Flashlight. Batteries were not on the list.
Why should I have to put it on the list? It's like saying to buy a car with tires.
Sami, tomorrow you lift a wallet from someone who looks like one of us.
What for?
What for?
We need to rent a car and for that you need a credit card.
That's an excellent plan. Very comforting.
We'll think of something.
Besides, we don't know the city and--
Mr. Bastaldi isn't asking you if you want to go. He's telling you you're going! And if he's telling you you're going to be going then you are going to go!
You think it's smart to tell him we're French?
I think he's already figured that out.
That moron.
It was an honest mistake. Ridgeway... Ridgeroad... Ridgeway Road.
It was an honest mistake. Ridgeway... Ridgeroad... Ridgeway Road.
Everyone get some sleep. We're leaving in the morning.
The deal is whatever Mr. Bastaldi says it is.
You know, if you could get your nose out of Bastaldi's ass for two seconds you might see what's going on around you.
Did you know about Bastaldi's deal with Zammito?
No.
No.
You're sure?
You're sure?
I think if he told me he was going to steal Van Gogh's "Sunflowers in a vase" I would remember it.
Fuck you! You know I'd never go along with something like this.
Do I?
Do I?
This ain't about that and you know it. This is about you never forgiving me for leaving the crew.
You call being Bastaldi's lap dog better?
Better than spending my life crawling through windows in the middle of the night.
I'm not a guy who is known for his patience and right now you're testing mine.
What is that a threat? Are you fuckin' threatening me, Marcel?
We had a chance to walk out of Zammito's house.
We all agreed to it. You had no way of knowing Bastaldi was setting us up.
We all agreed to it. You had no way of knowing Bastaldi was setting us up.
I just want to live long enough to get back to Paris. Just long enough to kill Bastaldi.
We still have to get out of here.
Maybe if we gave the tapes back --
This is Zero.
Hi. I'm one and this is two, three, four and five.
After the outside alarm is off we go in through the bedroom window.
Good. Zero and Julien will go in through the window and disable the motion detector. The rest of us will come in through the front door.
We've got to be careful not to use our real names while we're in here.
Good idea.
Good idea.
I'll be Elvis and you--
It's not?
That's Frankie Zammito. The Under boss of the Chicago Mafia.
How'd it go? I don't know. Daniel, how would you say it went?
I would have to say... pretty fuckin' bad. You gave us the wrong address Sophie.
What's the big deal? It's not like I was on guard duty or something.
You didn't think it was little suspicious that someone you only knew for a few hours wanted to sleep with you?
You didn't think it was little suspicious that someone you only knew for a few hours wanted to sleep with you?
No. Chicks dig me.
They'll be waiting for us at the airport.
You steal some money from a man he gets over it in time. But these tapes. He's never going to stop looking for us.
You steal some money from a man he gets over it in time. But these tapes. He's never going to stop looking for us.
We have to find Sophie.
It makes sense. I mean, do you really think he would come along if he knew we were being set up?
I think he'd cut his dick off if Bastaldi told him to.
All right, knock it off.
All you are is a professional ass-kisser.
Hadley --
Has to be.
It's not your fault, Daniel.
No?
Okay. Airports, train stations, bus station are out. We know they're connected to the car rental agencies because that's where they picked up Raymond.
Even if we get out of town and go to another airport I'm sure the FBI and Chicago P.D. has alerted customs.
Hello?
Get out of the room! You've got company coming up. I'll meet you at the Chevy.
What's he joking around for? He's been shot.
He's been shot a lot. He's used to it.
Anybody hungry?
What'd you get?
What'd you get?
Some bread and...
What?
Can I trust you, Sami?
Can I trust you, Sami?
Hey, who warned you that they were coming up to the room?
Hey, who warned you that they were coming up to the room?
If they had taken us by surprise they would have gotten the tapes back. That would have left us with nothing.
If they had taken us by surprise they would have gotten the tapes back. That would have left us with nothing.
No, that would have left me with nothing because all of you would be dead.
No, that would have left me with nothing because all of you would be dead.
You haven't answered my question.
You haven't answered my question.
Does it really matter what I say?
Does it really matter what I say?
I'm leaving you with my friends. I'm trusting you to do the right thing today.
I'm leaving you with my friends. I'm trusting you to do the right thing today.
I will.
I will.
You better.
Did you have to use that much explosive?
I promised Bonanno I'd destroy the tapes.
I'll be right back. He gets out of the car and walks over to him.
What do you want now?
What do you want now?
Guns. Can you get them?
Guns. Can you get them?
Man, I can get anything.
Man, I can get anything.
Don't bullshit me.
Don't bullshit me.
I ain't bullshittin'. I can get guns. I can get any kind of gun you want. But they ain't gonna help your sorry ass. You ain't been in town one day and already you got two of the toughest people in Chicago looking for you. How is that possible?
I ain't bullshittin'. I can get guns. I can get any kind of gun you want. But they ain't gonna help your sorry ass. You ain't been in town one day and already you got two of the toughest people in Chicago looking for you. How is that possible?
I've got a way with people.
I've got a way with people.
I can see that. The man's car you stole. Raphael Ruiz. He's head of the 19th Street gang and one crazy motherfucker. And Frankie Zammito's got the word out he's looking for some French dudes. You're French ain't ya?

I'm from Belgium.
I'm from Belgium.
Yeah, I'd be from Belgium too if I was you. You know Zammito just put his own brother in the hospital? Broke his arm cause he was late on a debt. I mention this to illustrate the kind of people who are lookin' for you.
Yeah, I'd be from Belgium too if I was you. You know Zammito just put his own brother in the hospital? Broke his arm cause he was late on a debt. I mention this to illustrate the kind of people who are lookin' for you.
Why haven't you turned us in?
Why haven't you turned us in?
I ain't no rat. You got money, right?
And, uh, I'm going to have to charge you a commission... kind of like a brokerage fee.
How much?
How much?
A thousand dollars?
A thousand dollars?
Fine.
Yeah?
It's me.
It's me.
Hey you guys are becoming famous. I was just watching the news and--
Hey you guys are becoming famous. I was just watching the news and--
-- Did you set it up?
-- Did you set it up?
Yeah. All set. Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock. Room 211. Barclay Hotel on River Street. Oh, and due to your recent notoriety and the heat that comes with it, I'm going to have to increase my brokerage fee to twenty five hundred.
Yeah. All set. Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock. Room 211. Barclay Hotel on River Street. Oh, and due to your recent notoriety and the heat that comes with it, I'm going to have to increase my brokerage fee to twenty five hundred.
We had a deal.
We had a deal.
We had a deal before you and your friends became the new poster boys for crime.
We had a deal before you and your friends became the new poster boys for crime.
Fine. Ten o'clock.
There's ten grand in here. It's yours. I'm going to call you again. There's one more thing I need you to do.
What?
What?
I'll tell you when it's time.
Okay, we're square now, right?
There's just one more thing I need you to do.
Maybe you should call the police.
Hey, idiot -- I've got stolen wheels and a stolen radio in the car.
Hey, idiot -- I've got stolen wheels and a stolen radio in the car.
I just thought that--
I just thought that--
-- Don't think. Okay? You're not good at it.
-- you stole my cousin Enrique's car.
Hector, don't interrupt me.
Hector, don't interrupt me.
He told Enrique he didn't know anything about his car.
He told Enrique he didn't know anything about his car.
I don't give a shit about your cousin's car. We're here about my car. So, shut your mouth! You think you can do that? You think you can keep your big mouth shut?
Tell me the truth Hector... do you think we'll find my car?
Hard to say.
What'd I tell you? Huh, Vinny? What'd I tell you when you came to me for money? Didn't I ask you not to do it? Did I not say that? What'd I say to him?
You said don't do it, boss.
You said don't do it, boss.
That's right. I said don't do it. Did you listen to me? No. You wanted the money. So, I lent you twenty large. Now it's been three weeks and you ain't paid a dime. What do you think that makes me look like on the street? I don't do something to you and everyone will think they can skate.
Hey boss, it's not a science.
Send some flowers. Something nice. Roses or carnations. And one of those get well soon cards.
They were all French guys.
French guys? You mean like from France?
French guys? You mean like from France?
Yeah, French guys from France.
Yeah, French guys from France.
What'd they take?
What'd they take?
Everything.
Everything.
Everything?
Everything?
Everything.
Everything.
Boy, you must be pissed.
Boy, you must be pissed.
Well, you know, when five guys break into my house in the middle of the night, stick guns in my face, tie me up and steal from me... it does irritate me.

Well, I must say you're handling it very well.
Well, I must say you're handling it very well.
You know why I'm handling it very well? Because you're going to get these guys for me.
You know why I'm handling it very well? Because you're going to get these guys for me.
Okay boss. Where are they?
Okay boss. Where are they?
If I knew where they were you wouldn't have to find them, would you?
If I knew where they were you wouldn't have to find them, would you?
You didn't say find them. You said, "get them."
You didn't say find them. You said, "get them."
Just find them!
Just find them!
Okay boss.
But we ain't had nothing to eat all day boss.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Can you believe that guy? What a moron.
Good song though.
Good song though.
Great fuckin' song.
What'd you guys find?
Dead bodies. The ones in the Lincoln are your... associates.
Dead bodies. The ones in the Lincoln are your... associates.
And the other car?
And the other car?
Some French guy. At least that's what his passport said. You know Joey, I shouldn't be talking to you about this.
Some French guy. At least that's what his passport said. You know Joey, I shouldn't be talking to you about this.
Are you forgetting who supplements your income?
Are you forgetting who supplements your income?
No. It's just that the French guy had a gunshot wound on his neck. So, this is a homicide. Are you guys involved in this?
No. It's just that the French guy had a gunshot wound on his neck. So, this is a homicide. Are you guys involved in this?
Yeah. I'll come down and make a full confession later. Right now, tell me what else you found?
Yeah. I'll come down and make a full confession later. Right now, tell me what else you found?
A Wallet. A hotel room card. Some cash.
What hotel?
The Holiday Hotel.
The Holiday Hotel.
What room number?
What room number?
I don't know. I didn't look.
I don't know. I didn't look.
Go look.
The map said to go left.
Yeah and if you turned it around it would say to go right.
Yeah and if you turned it around it would say to go right.
Oh yeah.
There has to be.
I'm telling you I've pulled out everything in the safe. There aren't any jewels.
I'm telling you I've pulled out everything in the safe. There aren't any jewels.
There must be half a million dollars here though.
What do we do?
I was told to take what we have and go.
I was told to take what we have and go.
Go where? The police are outside.
They don't have a wine list.
Oh, then we will have the house wine.
There's an exterior alarm system. There's also another one in the hall that leads to the bedroom with a motion detector. The control panel is in the bedroom.
I can handle the exterior alarm, but the one in the bedroom is a problem.
What about transportation?
You can use my car.
No, I didn't.
Bastaldi got the address from you, yes?
Bastaldi got the address from you, yes?
Yes.
Yes.
And he gave it to us. 145 Ridgeway Road.
And he gave it to us. 145 Ridgeway Road.
No. 145 Ridgeroad Way.
I'm Sami. Marcel sent me.
What is it you do, Sami?
What is it you do, Sami?
You know, a little of this, a little of that. I've boosted cars, stole radios, run a few scams. Right now I'm into pick-pocketing.
You know, a little of this, a little of that. I've boosted cars, stole radios, run a few scams. Right now I'm into pick-pocketing.
I see. A master criminal.
I see. A master criminal.
Hey, I was told to come here by Marcel. You guys don't want me, I'll be more than happy to leave.
They don't serve wine here.
What kind of restaurant doesn't serve wine?
What kind of restaurant doesn't serve wine?
This kind.
This kind.
Okay. I will have a beer.
I don't know. Maybe if we did just leave --
C'mon, get real, will you. You think he's just going to forget about this? These guys are all about respect. All about honor. He's coming after us, so we might as well take the money.
No wonder Zammito didn't want us to walk out with this stuff. He's planning on killing Bonanno and taking over the family.
This wasn't the deal! The deal was to steal a necklace, not get in the middle of a Mafia war.
I knew this was a mistake! I knew it last night when you asked me to go along with this. I could hear that little voice in my head saying, "don't do it! Don't you do it!" Jesus, why don't I ever listen to myself?
Yeah, but you did do it. So let's deal with that.
This is bad. This is really fuckin' bad. Am I the only one who sees how bad this is?
Hey, it's not your picture on the TV, it's mine. So, try to be cool.
Hey, it's not your picture on the TV, it's mine. So, try to be cool.
Don't tell me to be cool! We were supposed to be in and out. In and out! In the last twenty four hours we've managed to get the Mafia... the FBI... the Chicago Police Department and a group of Latin gang members after us. I haven't left out anyone, have I? I don't think so, because we've already pissed off everyone in the fuckin'

We've got to get out of here.
We've got to get out of here.
That's brilliant! Care to elaborate?
Maybe I'm missing the obvious, but why aren't we leaving town? Any place has to be safer for us than Chicago.
It doesn't matter where we go. Between Zammito and the FBI they'll find us. We have to end this here.
Oh, man... this is bullshit! You can't trust anyone these days.
She took everything! Didn't even leave us cab fare.
I am not comfortable with this. I'm not a good liar.
Relax. It will be fine.
I'll drive.
I'm the driver.
I'm the driver.
I've never driven a Cadillac before.
This is a car. I think this is the best American car I've ever driven.
This is the only American car you've ever driven.
I knew I should have driven.
Stop talking. I'm trying to concentrate.
When we get to the next corner jump out.
I'm not going to leave you.
I'm not going to leave you.
We both know I'm already dead.
A Black Panther was a member of an African American militant group in the sixties, Marcel. I think you're referring to The Pink Panther.
Pink panther, black panther. Who gives a shit? And I don't remember asking you a God Damn thing, you little turd.

What the hell is he talking about?

I'm talking about human beings communicating openly and honestly.
I'm talking about human beings communicating openly and honestly.
How about getting on your knees and communicating with my dick?
No. How much?
I don't know. It's gotta be millions.
How about Canada?
What are we going to do, take a taxi?
Going somewhere?
Oh, Marcel! I thought you were somebody else. If I knew it was you I would have never run.
Today's your lucky day, Sami.
Yeah, I can see that.
Yeah, I can see that.
Normally I'd be breaking your fingers right now, but I'm going to give you a chance to make enough to pay me back and have some extra for yourself. We have a group going to Chicago to do a job. You're going with them.

You lived there. You know the city.

I've still got a few legal problems back in the States.
-- I want to be Elvis.
It's my idea.
It's my idea.
C'mon, I look more like Elvis than you do.
C'mon, I look more like Elvis than you do.
Okay. You can be Elvis.
We have a problem. Problem isn't the right word. Dilemma. No that really doesn't describe -- Do you know who that is?
Mr. Taylor?
Mr. Taylor?
No, that's not Mr. Taylor.
Why would they want us to rob the Mafia?

"Vase with twelve Sunflowers."
Whatever! He never told me about the Van Gogh or any of the other paintings.
You guys used to work together?
Yeah and he can't stand it that I tried to do something to better myself.
It's good.
God, I want to go home.
God, I want to go home.
Hey, you know you can't this in France.
This is great. After everything we've been through we've got eight hundred euros and an autographed baseball.
The baseball is mine.
The baseball is mine.
No! You can't have the baseball! You're not entitled to the fuckin' baseball!
Fine. All of you want to be angry? Be angry... but I'm the one who took the ball and that makes it mine.
No.
No.
Give it to me, Sami.
Give it to me, Sami.
No!
How's my brother?
He's over at St. James. They had to put two pins in his arm.
He's over at St. James. They had to put two pins in his arm.
I said a clean break.
Who is closer to the wall, Joey or me?
Get in the car.
Get in the car.
Just tell me who's closer to the wall?
What happened?
They sort of got away.
They sort of got away.
I see. Well, get back out on the street and find them before I "sort of" kill you.
Anybody know about that car outside?
Yeah. It's mine.
Yeah. It's mine.
No. It's mine.
No. It's mine.
The hell it is.
The hell it is.
I'm telling you that's my car! And someone's gonna pay for it!

And I'm tellin' you it ain't! Now, turn your taco-eating ass around and get the hell out of here.
And I'm tellin' you it ain't! Now, turn your taco-eating ass around and get the hell out of here.
Fuck you, grease-ball!

Uh huh.
Uh huh.
I represent a person who wishes to remain anonymous, but is aware of your current financial problems with your brother.

How?
How?
You see that car?
Yeah.
It's yours. A gift. A gift you could give to your brother... or anyone you owe money to as partial payment.
It's yours. A gift. A gift you could give to your brother... or anyone you owe money to as partial payment.
No shit?
No shit?
The papers for the car will arrive tomorrow.
I am Raymond. Thank you for allowing us to stay here.
No problem, man. Hey, you wanna hit?
No problem, man. Hey, you wanna hit?
No thank you.
Oh, Pepe Le Pew. He is very funny and quite well known in France.
Yeah, I dig him.
Yeah, I dig him.
Although a cartoon I feel he shares a universal theme: We are all searching for love. No?
How are we going to do that?
I know where she went.
I would like to thank you for your hospitality. If you are ever in Paris here is my number.
Cool.
He speaks about himself in the third person?
Feel free to correct him if you want.
I'm glad you didn't get something flashy.
Watch this.
I think we went the wrong way.
Oh, you think?
Holy shit.
What?
How do we know what room she's in?
Wait here.
The money isn't here.
Where is it, Sophie?
I said knock it off! Now as far as I'm concerned you two girls can bitch slap yourselves silly when this is over, but right now we've got to figure out what's going on.
It's simple. Bastaldi's moving up. He's closing down his operation and this is his way of saying thanks to all of us.
You're not helping.
Julien, what you're doing right now is a very normal psychological reaction to stress. You're projecting your anger onto us.
I say we make him pay first. After that you can do whatever you want to him.
He's right. Do you have any idea what Van Gogh's "Vase with twelve Sunflowers" is worth?
The new Beaujolais' come out in France next week. You like wine?
I'm more of a whiskey drinker myself.

Well, you know, not all Algerians speak French. It's a matter of what school you went too. Me I never really --
Well, you know, not all Algerians speak French. It's a matter of what school you went too. Me I never really --
-- Zero isn't interested in your life story. Who gets killed?
You put a loaded gun in your bag and brought it through customs? How stupid is that?
Zero did not put it in his bag. He put it in yours.
I can't even hear myself think.
How are we supposed to sleep with this noise?
They send us to Zammito's house. The FBI is right across the street watching the whole thing, but they don't move. A crime is going down and they don't move. Why? Because they were waiting for us to come out so they could arrest us.
What does arresting us get them?
What does arresting us get them?
You wanna tell him?
It has to be at Sophie's. She didn't have time to go anywhere else before she came here.
We don't know that for sure.
And how do we do that?
I don't know.
They killed our friend. It's personal now. Besides, if we do that, then Julien died for nothing. The tapes are the key.
He's right. The tapes give us leverage with Bastaldi.
I wasn't expecting this many of you. I've got a few sleeping bags you can use.
Thanks.
When do we go?
Tonight.
You ever hear of jet lag?
Take a nap.
You like shoes?
No, I like the bag. It would be good for the job tonight.
No, I like the bag. It would be good for the job tonight.
It belongs to Vincent Bastaldi. He left it last time he was here. I'm sure he wouldn't mind if you used it.
So, how did you get hooked up with these guys?
Just lucky I guess. How'd you start working for the Bastaldi's?
Just lucky I guess. How'd you start working for the Bastaldi's?
The art world doesn't fully appreciate my talent yet. I needed some way to pay the rent. Laurant and Vincent pay well for information.

I've been thinking about getting tattoo. You know, a flower or something. On my ass.
Who's gonna see it there?
The lucky ones.
Can't sleep?
No.
No.
I'm sorry things went so wrong today.

It's not your fault.

It's three in the morning. Not much else to do.
I really thought we had something special going. I can't tell you what a disappointment you've turned out to be.
After last night I could say the same for you.
Who are you waiting for?
Stick around and find out.
Why?
Vincent Bastaldi is in jail.
Frankie, I --
-- Shut up! Don't you try to make me feel bad about this. You knew what would happen to you if you didn't pay. This is on your head, not mine. Break his arm.
Jesus, Frankie, I'm your brother!
That's why we're only breaking one arm.
She seems pleasant enough.
She doesn't know. She thinks I fell down the stairs.

You gonna forget about the money I owe you?

What are you nuts? A debt is a debt. I was thinking I'd throw a little extra work your way. You know, you come down to the club, make espresso for the boys... wash their cars... run some errands... things like that.
What's this?
A car.

Oh really? Thanks. I thought it was a sewing machine. What the hell is it doing here?

I don't care about your sword.
Why were you spying on the Yus?

I'm looking for someone. Jade Fox. I'm a police inspector from Shaan Xi, Gen Su district. Jade Fox is a master criminal. I hear she infiltrated the Yus. She must have come with them when they transferred here. But with Yu's reputation, I can't just go in and accuse her.

Yes.
Yes.
Then leave her to me.

Pardon me, but I doubt you can handle her. My wife was quite a martial arts expert. Jade Fox killed her. So you see, this is personal. Leave her to me.
Isn't it a bit too late to be out? You've brought me the sword?
I do as I please.
Where's your master?
What's it to you?
Do you think you are a real master?
Like most things, I am nothing. It's the same for this sword. All of it is simply a state of mind.

That's a risk I'm willing to take. Deep down, you're good. Even Jade Fox couldn't corrupt you.
Who are you? Why is the Green Destiny in your possession?

My name is Li Mu Bai. The Green Destiny is mine. Jade Fox can't be your master. Where did you learn that "Xuan Piu" move?

They wouldn't have found me if you hadn't stolen the sword. Like a little girl, you thought stealing would be fun? You, too, are responsible for that death. Come with me. You don't want to waste your life as the wife of some bureaucrat. Denied your talent... As a master and disciple we will rule.

I studied the diagrams. But you hid the details!

Master... I started learning from you in secret when I was 10. You enchanted me with the world of Giang Hu. But once I realized I could surpass you, I became so frightened! Everything fell apart. I had no one to guide me, no one to learn from.

This spells trouble.
I have a guest.
It's heavy for such a thin piece of metal!
The handle is heavy. And the blade is no ordinary metal. Still, the sword is the lightest of weapons. You're just not used to handling it.

You're a sword fighter too?

It must be exciting to be a fighter, to be totally free!

How dare you accuse us? I always knew you had stolen the sword! I've done nothing but protect you and your family. And you're repaid me with nothing but contempt. Li Mu Bai himself spared you, and all you do is insult him. We wanted some peace and you've ruined it all! You're no sister of mine!

She used Purple Yin... Purple Yin poison. It goes straight to the heart.
Take my horse and go to the compound. Give this to Mrs. Wu. She'll help you. Hurry!
Spare your energy. I'll be back!
Stop it! You don't deserve the Green Destiny.

Give it back!
Kneel!

Never!

The antidote exists. She taught it to me. The formula is simple, but it takes time to prepare. Trust me. As you have helped me, let me help you.
All right. Hurry. I will hold on as long as I can.
Lo?
Jen!
You shouldn't have come.
With all the traffic on your rooftop these days... it took me a while to get in here. I can't wait any longer. I was wrong to let you go. Come back with me. You'll be happy in the desert. You'll be free there.
Let's stop a moment.
Give it back!
Give it back!
You're tired. You need rest. Your horse needs water. There's a creek up here.
Well, there used to be! What's your name? I'm Lo. The Hans call me Dark Cloud. I'm not that tall or big, but I'm quick as lightning.
My comb!
You've got quite a temper. It's better this way.
You coward!

When I was a boy, one night, I saw a thousand shooting stars. I thought, where did they all go? I'm an orphan. I used to look for stars alone. I thought if I rode to the other end of the desert, I'd find them. I've been riding in the desert ever since.
And so, the little boy became a fearsome bandit. He couldn't find the stars, so he stole my comb.
Out here, you always fight for survival. You have to be part of a gang to stand a chance. Slowly, your gang becomes your family. All that Dark Cloud stuff is just to scare people and make my life easier.
So you're still that little boy looking for shooting stars.

Don't send me back!

No. I didn't feel the bliss of enlightenment. Instead... I was surrounded by an endless sorrow. I couldn't bear it. I broke off my meditation. I couldn't go on. There was something... pulling me back.

So what will you do now?
Come with me to Peking. You can give the sword to Sir Te yourself. It'll be just like old times.
First I must visit my master's grave. It's been many years since Jade Fox murdered him. I have yet to avenge his death. And yet I'm thinking of quitting. I must pray for his forgiveness.

No, I'd already sent them home. You can blame me for losing the sword, but please trust that I'll get it back soon using my own methods.

Then, why did you come?

Well, we had talked...
I admit, getting it back makes me realize how much I'd missed it.
But it's not your sword anymore. You gave it to Sir Te.
But it's not your sword anymore. You gave it to Sir Te.
True. But I must borrow it for one last mission. Jade Fox must die at its edge. Did you know what you were hiding when you covered for that girl?
True. But I must borrow it for one last mission. Jade Fox must die at its edge. Did you know what you were hiding when you covered for that girl?
My job was to get the sword back, without embarassing anyone. I wasn't about to ruin her life, or her father's.

She's an aristocrat's daughter. She's not one of us. In any case, it will all be over soon. You'll kill Fox, and she'll marry.

Just be patient with me, Shu Lien.
You think Jade Fox will show up?
She's out there, but I doubt she'll show herself. We'll keep our eyes open. Sooner or later, she'll come for the girl.
Don't you want to see her again.
All right. I'll write you an introduction. Take it to Wudan. Wait there for news from me.
Shu Lien... The things we touch have no permanence. My master would say... there is nothing we can hold on to in this world. Only by letting go can we truly possess what is real.
Not everything is an illusion. My hand... wasn't that real?
Not everything is an illusion. My hand... wasn't that real?
Your hand, rough and callused from machete practice... All this time, I've never had the courage to touch it.
Giang Hu is a world of tigers and dragons, full of corruption... I tried sincerely to give it up but I have brought us only trouble.
To repress one's feelings only makes them stronger.

You're right, but I don't know what to do. I want to be with you... just like this. It gives me a sense of peace.
We're close to your headquarters. Go home and check in.
What about you?
What about you?
I'll look around and catch up later.
I'll look around and catch up later.
Not a bad idea. Tonight we'll get a good night's sleep at headquarters.
What happened?
Jade Fox drugged her. How did you get here?
Jade Fox drugged her. How did you get here?
We followed Jade Fox.
My blood will soon reverse its flow. It's the same poison she used to kill my master. There is no antidote.
That can't be! Everything has an antithesis! Why not this?
Mu Bai, hold on. Give me some hope...
Shu Lien...
Shu Lien...
Save your strength.

My life is departing. I've only one breath left.

I've already wasted my whole life. I want to tell you with my last breath... I have always loved you. I would rather be a ghost, drifting by your side... as a condemned soul... than enter heaven without you. Because of your love... I will never be a lonely spirit.
Madam Te is certainly spoiling us with these wedding gifts. She's being so considerate.
I'm sorry she's not feeling well enough to receive you today.
I'm sorry she's not feeling well enough to receive you today.
I heard Sir Te lost something. And now Madame Te's not feeling well...
We know who stole the missing item. If the thief returns it, I'm sure Sir Te will pursue the matter no further.
That's good. Sometimes the help can't keep their hands to themselves. It's very embarassing.

Yes. The very killer of Li Mu Bai's own master. Last night, she killed a policeman who had tracked her down.
Yes. The very killer of Li Mu Bai's own master. Last night, she killed a policeman who had tracked her down.
A female criminal! Now that's news!
Maybe the murderer and the thief are one and the same.
I doubt it. This thief... it very unusual...
It's Jade Fox!
We must avenge mother!
You're mistaken. We're just street performers. We were rehearsing.
Father!
They're gone.
What does it say?
What does it say?
"We'll settle this at midnight on Yellow Hill." Good, the fox is out of her hole.
If you surrender now, you'll suffer less. But if you resist, I won't stop until you're dead.
Father! Let me avenge my mother's death.
This is Li's personal sword, a great hero's weapon! He is the only one in the world worthy of carrying it. It's too fine a gift. I cannot accept it.
Sir Te! It has brought him as much trouble as glory. Help him to leave these troubles behind. Otherwise, he'll never be able to start anew.
Sir Te! It has brought him as much trouble as glory. Help him to leave these troubles behind. Otherwise, he'll never be able to start anew.
All right. I'll act as the sword's custodian.
You've always been so good to Li Mu Bai and me. Please accept our thanks.
Please do not be such a stranger. You'll stay the night as my guest. Now, Shu Lien... tell me something. And forgive me for prying. Your father was a great friend to me, and I think of you as my own daughter.

I don't know...

Don't be coy. I've always known about your feelings for each other. All these years, it's a shame... neither of you is brave enough to admit the truth to the other. You're both wasting precious time.

I beg your pardon. Li Mu Bai and I aren't cowards.
I beg your pardon. Li Mu Bai and I aren't cowards.
When it comes to emotions, even great heroes can be idiots. Tell me if Li Mu Bai is not more open the next time you see him. I'll give him an earful!
Has Governor Yu ever seen the sword?
Yes, though I doubt he's involved in this.
Yes, though I doubt he's involved in this.
But the sword could be in his compound.
But the sword could be in his compound.
Then someone's trying to set him up. We should inform Li Mu Bai.
We must be careful. Governor Yu is a court official, and in charge of security. Any disturbance will cast suspicion on him. It might get Sir Te in trouble.
This is a delicate matter.

This is special, darlin'. Please?
Just don't tell me you "owe me one." What file?
Double homicide. A year ago. Las Halloween.
Don't thank me. Your ass is already in enough trouble for this shit.
I knew that.

You gonna wind up working at a school crosswalk. that doughnut's chocolate you, know.
Well, hello there...chocolate,
Don't thank me.
Don't thank me.
Thanks, babe.
And I say I'm dead... and I move.
No further. I'm serious.
Are you nuts, walking into a gun?
You must listen carefully: the Fire Department will be here soon. There is an injured man in the alley who needs assistance. As Shelly Webster once needed your assistance, and as you are shortly going to need my assistance.
Listen: Top Dollar. He "owns the street here." He will "erase my ass."
You don't say.
You don't say.
I know Top Dollar has turned your streets into his hell.

The others are called Skank, T- Bird. Street names. Funboy. Watch me, office Albrecht.
You, my friend, are dead. I saw your body. You got buried.
I saw it, too.
You died, man. I can't believe it but here you are. Last year, you and your girlfriend --
I need you to tell me what you remember. What happened to us?
I need you to tell me what you remember. What happened to us?
You went out the window. She was beaten and raped. She died in the hospital.
You okay, man? I mean, what just happened.
The venom of bad memories. You were there; you saw her. I saw you seeing her.
My name.
I'm sorry as hell, man.
I'm sorry as hell, man.
Thirty hours. A day of life, plus change...
Halloween is coming, soon. You will have Top Dollar if you watch for me at the Showtime, tomorrow night.
I should be trying to stop you.
Thank you. For giving a damn.
My pleasure. ERIC Don't smoke these.
It's done. ALBRECHT I figured as much. Did you cap off Funboy.
Funboy had to leave this mortal coil.

It's only a flesh wound.

It's only fourteen or fifteen flesh wounds.
I mean, I've done what I came to do. It shouldn't hurt this much. But it will pass...
Right. You sure I can't just take you to the emergency ward?
They couldn't do anything for me.
How 'bout the morgue?
How 'bout the morgue?
No. I have one more thing to do.
You sorta looked like you might need my help.
This isn't your place. This isn't your fight. And I don't need your help.
This isn't your place. This isn't your fight. And I don't need your help.
You're welcome.

Leave here. Don't do this. I don't want you here.
Leave here. Don't do this. I don't want you here.

Don't interfere.
You're bleeding, man. You can't make it.
Mom --?
I told you you're not supposed to come in here.
I told you you're not supposed to come in here.

He was a present. Besides, we're moving anyway. You said.
We'll discuss this later. Obviously. You left the door open.
At least it finally stopped raining.
It can't rain all the time.

Do you feel okay.
No.
No.
You gotta go now, I bet.
You gotta go now, I bet.
I have to go.
What's going on...?
A remembrance. A closure.
You brought flowers. As long as you don't forget her, Elly, she lives.
She's dead. She's gone. And now you're just gonna go away and never come back, too. I hate this place; it isn't fair.
She's dead. She's gone. And now you're just gonna go away and never come back, too. I hate this place; it isn't fair.
Elly...
I remember him! Here, Gabriel... here kitty... Gabriel... Is he still yours?
I think he's yours, now.

And she'll be alive. Up here.
Now do you get to see her? Shelly, I mean.
In a better place. I hope.
In a better place. I hope.
You're not gonna come back, are you?
I don't know if I can. But you have this... and you know where to come.

I'm looking for a good guitar man.

Right.
You buying? He kinda wanders around. You'll see him if you pay attention.
I need to find him kind of soon, Elly.
Little early from trick-or-treat, homie. This dick trying to bushwack me.

I believe our friend Elly call you Mister Crow. Please acknowledge; the mike will pick you up.
I can see her.
I can see her.
Of course you can. ANGLE - GRANGE IN THE GALLERY -- in darkness. The running lights on his night-scoped, laser-sighted sniper's rifle which THROWS vague sprays of eerie red and green light.
I wish to possess what you have now.
I want the girl. Unharmed. Now.
I want the girl. Unharmed. Now.
I know. That is why I will prevail. Mr. Grange... ?
Sooner or later, my action were destined to bring me a genuine Fury. And it turned out to be you. At last. I appreciate your abilities as few mortals can. That's why I desire them.
You're too late. There was a guy outside - on the stairs - you really need to talk to. But he turned to dust and blew away. I don't have any power for you to take.
You're too late. There was a guy outside - on the stairs - you really need to talk to. But he turned to dust and blew away. I don't have any power for you to take.
I don't believe that. Lao motions to Grange with the killing blade. Grange RELAXES his deathgrip on the crow. MOVE IN CLOSE on Eric so we may perceive a palpable degree of relief.
And how many lives have you destroyed?
I took yours from you. Your little girlfriend? I took hers, too. Your meaningless, petty life? I took it so that tonight your existence might gain a purpose. You're no avenger. You're mine.
How the hell did you do that?
Magic.
Neither.
Yeah, I got a more fun idea myself.
Owwwaaaa -- fuck me! Look what you did to my sheets, you lame piece'a shit! AAAAaa! Goddd!
Does it hurt?
Does it hurt?
Does it hurt?! You dead-ass, clown-faced fuck, of course it fucking hurts! What the shit are you gonna do about this?!
No, wait, no WAIT, that's too much, man, that's like overkill, nobody can take that much, you're wasting it -- !
Your pain ends now.
What the hell are you?
Interested? Follow the crow.
Having fun yet? No? I'll give you a hint. Remember whatshername?
Shelly?
Shelly?
Miss her?
Miss her?
Yes.
Yes.
Kill the men who killed you both, and the Day of the Dead will be your reunion.
Get it?
Leave me alone -- !
Glad to see you're finally with the program.

Shut up.

Maybe I was wrong about you.
Your job is done. You interfere with the living again.
Tell me I'll get hurt. That I might die. I've already done that. I don't need anyone's help. Yours included.
Do this thing and you will be vulnerable. The blood will not return. No powers. No reunion. Nothing.
Fine with me.
You'll be alone.
I'm already alone.
Don't waste my time.
Very well, it's your ass.
Blow yourself, bigmouth.

Yeah, I know, fatso. Do us all a favor. Make Top Dollar smile.
Did you see an animal of any kind? Did you see a bird?
No. I saw a guitar. This isn't some rock-n-roller you forgot to pay, is it? There was a drawing on the wall that looked like a bird. In blood.
What... the hell is that?
This is a cobra, Mr. Grange. Yes, it is real.
That thing is poisonous.
Extremely so. You and I are the recipients of unwanted good fortune, in the form of a man everyone is calling The Crow.
Give me a break. That guy's a wacko...
I intend no slight to you, but I cannot find the English to adequately express just what he is. I suppose Western mythology would describe him as a Fury.

Only thing you'll get from that clown is a faster way to die. LAO To the contrary...
Who is only invulnerable so long as he cares about the dead. When he begins to care about the living, you'll find his heart can bleed... and I want it to bleed for me.
Kill a dead guy?
We've got company.
Is he inside?
I've got him if you want him.
No shooting.

Move in, guys.

"Our" Crow...?

Come now. You've seen the graffiti -- all over the city in the few hors it has taken your men to drop like plague victims. What about your turf, Top? You don't seem to have ripped out anyone's heart yet.

Do you think this childish machismo impresses me? When I was a boy in Saigon I watched my country change one block at a time, one building at a time. Whole lives erased. A way of life, polluted. Today, no one forces me to move. I use my powers to change your country, one block at a time, one building at a time.

Well did you like it?
Well... I don't know - it was weird. At first it felt icky, then it felt kind of okay. Then, I started getting really hot and then I started shaking and then like, I don't t know... it felt like an explosion, but a good one.
Cecile, you had an orgasm.
I did?
I did?
I'm so proud of you. You're becoming a woman.
I'm so proud of you. You're becoming a woman.
I am?
Now listen. Now that you're on your way, it would be stupid of you to stop. Think of Sebastian as a tutor. Let him instruct you.
I don't love him. I love Ronald.
I don't love him. I love Ronald.
So? Don't you want to make Ronald a happy pappy? Practice makes perfect, Cecile. My advice is to sleep with as many people as possible.

But that would make me a slut. Wouldn't it?
But that would make me a slut. Wouldn't it?
Cecile, everybody does it. It's just that nobody talks about it.
It's like a secret society.
That's one way of looking at it.
That's one way of looking at it.
Cool.
My father just took me on a trip to Australia.
How are things down under? Blossoming I hope.
What year are you in?
I'm what you would call a fifth year senior.

Just taking your photo.

I look terrible.

Mmmm, you're right. Those clothes don't do you justice. Why don't you take them off.
I'm sorry that was out of line.
I want to go home.

Okay, okay. I'll just call your mom and have her come pick you up.
My mom? Don't call my mom.
My mom? Don't call my mom.
Why not? ... Oh wow, she doesn't know you're here. In fact, you're grounded. Jesus, you could get in a shitload of trouble for this. I think I should call her anyway.
Please please please. I'll do anything. Just don't call my mom.
Cecile, all I want to do is give you a kiss.
Cecile, all I want to do is give you a kiss.
And then I can go home?
And then I can go home?
Of course. I'm not a monster.
Just a kiss, right?
I swear.
What are you doing?
You promised to let me kiss you.
You promised to let me kiss you.
But -
But -
I don't want to kiss you here. I want to kiss you there.
Want to join me?
Some other time, Cecile.
Am I suppose to be this sore?
For the first time, yes. It'll pass.
I like it better when I'm on top.
Cecile. This is what I like to call quiet time. This is time when we reflect on what we've done.
Cecile. This is what I like to call quiet time. This is time when we reflect on what we've done.

Let me tell you something, doctor. Chicks love a guy with a bad rap. They say they don't, but they don't mean it. They all think that they're the ones that are going to "save me." The trick is to let them think it's true.

Don't be insecure, Doc. You're a big help.
You think you can come in here with that cute little smirk on your face and try and flirt with me. It doesn't work, Sebastian.
It works a little.

No it doesn't. I see right through you.

He told me he loved me and I believed him.
Who told you?
Who told you?
You don't know him. I'm so stupid.
Alright honey, just calm down, take a deep breath, and step out of the circle.
Would you cut the psycho babble bullshit, mom. There's pictures of me on the internet.
Nudie pictures, what do you think?
Jesus Christ, how can you be so stupid?
Jesus Christ, how can you be so stupid?
I don't know. He was just so charming. All he did was talk about how I had killer legs and how we wanted to photograph them. Things just got out of hand from there. Mom? Are you there? Mom? Mother!!!!
Oh baby... oh baby...
Baby? Right on time.
Hey Blaine, did I leave my... holy shit.

What do you do? Tell her you love her.
But I can't even see her. She doesn't have her own phone, I don't even know her e-mail address.
Hello.
Ronald?

I'll be right there.
And when I confronted him about his affair with Cecile he told me it was none of my business. Then when I said "Well what about Ronald," he said you were nothing more than a stupid... the n word and that you deserved what you got...
And this happened before you and I hooked up?

Cecile's attending Oakwood in the fall.
Outstanding.
Do you care to tell me what Mrs. White-trash and her stupid daughter are doing in my house?
I'm just taking the poor girl under my wing.
Lovely. How is your gold digging whore of a mother enjoying Bali? Zipping through my inheritance per usual?
Hopefully, though she suspects that your decrepit alcoholic father is diddling the maid.
Oh, poor baby. Well you can relax. I have a mission for you.
What?
Sorry.
In any event, my feelings were hurt when I learned that he had fallen for someone else. Someone chaste... pure... innocent.

Because if there's an attack made on Court it could be traced back to me. I can't allow that to happen. Everybody loves me and I intend to keep it that way.

She's quite cute you know. Young supple breasts, a tight firm ass and an uncharted pootie.
Why not?
Oh come on, Kathryn. It's too easy. "But I thought high school was only four years." I mean, please. She knows nothing. She's seen nothing. I could have her under the table at Au Bar sucking me off before the appetizer arrived. Go get one of those moron friends of yours to do it. I have a reputation to uphold.

It just so happens we're not in Kansas anymore. Our little angel's father has accepted the new headmaster position at Oakwood. She's staying with my aunt up in Connecticut while Daddy sells his house. Can you imagine what this would do for my reputation? Screwing the new headmaster's virginal daughter before school starts? It will be my greatest victory.

Before we go through with this, I just want you to be aware of the damage we're going to cause.
I'm aware.
Are you really? I mean, we've done some pretty fucked up shit in our time but this... I mean, we're destroying an innocent girl. You do realize that.
What is that? Oh my God, it's your conscience.
You amaze me.
Eat me, Sebastian. It's alright for you to fuck everyone, but because I'm a girl it's wrong. Well let me tell you something, I didn't ask to be a girl. Do you think I relish the fact that I have to act like Mary Sunshine twenty four seven, so I can be considered a "laaaady." Do you think I take great delight when I
I just had a nice chat with Cecile. I don't think she'll be giving you anymore problems.

Bad time?

Is that what you think?
That's not fair. You're taking all the fun out of it.
Then do me a favor and get rid of her. If not for me, then do it for you. Look at yourself. You're a joke. She's turned you into jelly.

Silly rabbit. My triumph isn't over her. It's over you.
Come again?
Come again?
You were very much in love with her and you're still in love with her. But it amused me to make you ashamed of it. You gave up on the first person you ever loved because I called you names. Don't get me wrong, I'm flattered that you chose me over her, but please understand, I never loved you, Sebastian. You're just a toy.
In any event, you still owe me my reward.
I'm sorry, but unfortunately I don't fuck losers.
Get off me!
Will you calm down?

I can't tell you how happy we are that Cecile is going to be attending Oakwood with you this fall. You've always been an inspiration to Beau and I on raising her. We just hope she can rise to the high standards which you've set for her.
I'll do my best.
You're too kind.
How do you do it? I mean with all peer pressuring that goes on in high school. Where do you get your strength?

Don't worry, it's totally understandable. Most of the boys that matriculate at Oakwood are very upstanding gentleman, however there are the occasional bad apples.
Like your step-brother Sebastian. I can't believe they didn't expel him after what he did to the school nurse.

You will be discreet about this?
You will be discreet about this?
Absolutely.
Let me get that for you.
Oh please. I can't have you do that.
Oh please. I can't have you do that.
It's the least I can do.
Who the hell do you think you are?!
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
I'm paying you to give cello lessons. Not to pervert my child.

Mrs. Caldwell I think you're misunderstanding something.
Mrs. Caldwell I think you're misunderstanding something.
Is that so?
Got me off the streets? I live on 59th and Park.
Whatever. You are never to set foot in this house again and you are never and I mean never to see my daughter again. Is that understood?!
First of all, maam, I never touched your daughter and second, I would like to think that in these times someone of your status could look beyond racial lines.
Oh don't give me any of that racist crap. My husband and I gave money to Colin Powell.
Oh don't give me any of that racist crap. My husband and I gave money to Colin Powell.
I guess that puts me in my place. Thank you for the hospitality Mrs. Caldwell. It was a true awakening.
Hi. Is Annette at home?

Fine. Could you please see that she gets this.
I'll do that.
It's really important.

I understand. Good night.
Did I ever tell you the time when my late husband sent me -
Yes, you already did.
Yes, you already did.
I did?
Right after we played backgammon.
We played backgammon?

Uh huh. You beat me three times.

Don't worry about it.
Wow. I never knew she had these kind of feelings.
You're a lucky guy.
You're a lucky guy.
She really loves me.
Ronald, e-mail's for geeks and pedophiles. Be romantic. Write her another letter.
How will I get to her?
Hey Ronald.
It seems that you and I have some talking to do.
It seems that you and I have some talking to do.
Can we do it later. I've had a really bad night and -
Where the hell do you come off hitting women?

Kathryn? Oh Christ, she got to you too?

Ronald, you don't know what you're talking about.
Ronald, you don't know what you're talking about.
Don't know what I'm talking about? I know that you fucked Cecile.
Ronald, I'm sorry.
You bastard!
to a situation) Really, Mr. Reed, there isn't anything to worry about. It was only a slap --
That's exactly what I told Mr. Reed, but he insisted upon remaining home from business to talk to you, Miss Callahan.
I'm so glad to have met you at last. You're just as nice as Amy told me you were. I hope you'll come to see us.
I'd love to.
Oh, hello.
Hello. I just met Amy and she pointed out where you live.
Oliver's pet, I'm sure it would be the first thing he'd grab if we ever had a fire.
I know how it is. My Dad collects miniature canon.
But it is a part of our lives too --a part of our past, It's a Goya reproduction. Those three cats -- are supposed to be the most beautifully drawn cats in Western art.
But you don't keep a cat, do you?
But you don't keep a cat, do you?
We don't even like them, I've often thought of giving it away, but Oliver wouldn't stand for it. It was his first wife's favorite picture. She was an artist.

I didn't know Mr. Reed had been married before.
I didn't know Mr. Reed had been married before.
Yes. As a matter of fact, I was on the point of telling you about it yesterday  about Oliver's first marriage  and his wife's death. It has so much to do with Amy  although he'll never realize it.
That the old actress -- Julia Farren?
Yes, She's a little odd, I understand.
Yes, She's a little odd, I understand.
But quite harmless, I'm sure.
Does she go up to the Farren's often?
No. I only let her go with Edward. It's alright.
I love the smell of pine.
It's one of the clearest memories I have. Twelfth night...burning pine... and mummers' plays.
It's one of the clearest memories I have. Twelfth night...burning pine... and mummers' plays.
It's been ages since I've even thought of a mummers' play. When I was in college we used to do them every year  St. George and the Dragon, all kinds of sword dances.
Forgive me, but it was superstition ...foolish, childish wishes...that started, all this.
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
I can see it all...the very day it began. Amy was lonely; she was desperate for friendship. I remember the night she told me she had wished on her ring. That must have been the day she first wished for a friend.
It's perfectly normal for a child to dream. I can see how a sensitive little girl, finding this portrait, would take the image of this woman and make of her an imaginary friend. That image dwells only in her imagination, and that image can go as quickly as it was born.
How?
How?
Once the emptiness in Amy's life is filled, the dream will go of itself. If a up to you, both of you. Only you two can bring her into a real world.. You must give her the friendship and love she craves.
You get your wish!
You know what I wished, Daddy? I wished I could be a good girl.
But Edward, in this kind of a wish that doesn't matter.
I can make wishes like this come true. I'll be just like Daddy wants me to be -- play with the other children -- not sit around by myself  tell the truth --
What are saying, darling?
I wasn't saying anything. I was singing.
I wasn't saying anything. I was singing.
I suppose any note, no matter how sour, is a song if you hold on to it long enough.
What song, dear?
The song I was trying to hum. The song my friend, taught me.
The song I was trying to hum. The song my friend, taught me.
Oh, you'll remember it some time.
Mommy --
Yes, darling.
Yes, darling.
Did you ever make a wish?
Did you ever make a wish?
Oh, lots of times.
Oh, lots of times.
Did your wishes ever come true?
Did your wishes ever come true?
Sometimes.
Sometimes.
I made a wish today, and it came true just like Edward said it would.
Where did you get this ring?
That's what I wished on. Edward says it's a wishing ring -- and it is!
That's what I wished on. Edward says it's a wishing ring -- and it is!
But where did you get it, Amy?
But where did you get it, Amy?
At the old house with the voice.
Someone gave it to you? Where was this old house?
On the back street  a green house

The Farren house

Do you know the people?

No dear. I don't know them, but I've heard about them.
No dear. I don't know them, but I've heard about them.
Are they nice?
Are they nice?
I really don't know, but I do know that you must return the ring. You get Edward to take you up there and bring it back to the old lady.
Well  the mother or daughter -- whichever one gave it to you. You ask Edward to go with you.
I got my wish anyway.
I got my wish anyway.
You mustn't tell anybody, or it won't come true.
You mustn't tell anybody, or it won't come true.
But it's already come true.
But it's already come true.
Sh! Then you must keep it true. Goodnight, darling.
Edward will give you your breakfast, Amy.
I had my breakfast while you were still asleep.
Where'd you get this, darling?
It was right there on top. Isn't she pretty?
It was right there on top. Isn't she pretty?
She was very pretty.
She was very pretty.
What's her name?
What's her name?
Irena.
Irena.
Irena.
Irena.
Look! Why don't you run out and play? The sun's shining.
Look! Why don't you run out and play? The sun's shining.
All right, mommy.
Oh, thank you, darling.
You can't open it yet. You have to put all of them under the tree until morning.
Mommy, could Edward take me to Mrs. Farren's house to give her her present?
Wouldn't it be just the same, darling, if daddy dropped the present at Mrs. Farren's on his way to town tomorrow morning?
Wouldn't it be just the same, darling, if daddy dropped the present at Mrs. Farren's on his way to town tomorrow morning?
But it won't be Christmas tomorrow.
But it won't be Christmas tomorrow.
All right, Amy. Go tell Edward to take you.
Well, it shows imagination, anyhow.
I wonder if you don't resent that in her?
I wonder if you don't resent that in her?
I'm sure I don't, Alice. It's something else -- something moody -- something sickly -- She could almost be Irena's child.
I'd hate her to grow up like that.
She's not Irena's child -- there's nothing of Irena in her. She's my child.
All I have to do is look at Amy's eyes, blue and deep like yours.
I'm not a jealous woman, Oliver.
I'm not a jealous woman, Oliver.
I know that.
I know that.
That's why I can tell you, straight out, you think too much about Irena -- blame yourself for her death. And its your thinking and brooding about her that makes you so unnaturally concerned about Amy.
That's why I can tell you, straight out, you think too much about Irena -- blame yourself for her death. And its your thinking and brooding about her that makes you so unnaturally concerned about Amy.
No. It's not that. It's because I know what can happen when people begin to lie to themselves -- imagine things. I love Amy too much to let her lose herself in a dream world where butterflies become pals. I saw what happened to Irena with her Cat People.
No. It's not that. It's because I know what can happen when people begin to lie to themselves -- imagine things. I love Amy too much to let her lose herself in a dream world where butterflies become pals. I saw what happened to Irena with her Cat People.
I know, dear. I understand. But try to worry a little less about her -- be a little easier in your thinking. And especially today  let's forget about it. We want a really bang-up birthday party, don't we?
I know, dear. I understand. But try to worry a little less about her -- be a little easier in your thinking. And especially today  let's forget about it. We want a really bang-up birthday party, don't we?
You make me sound like the father in "East Lynne."
You make me sound like the father in "East Lynne."
Darling, no father could be nicer to a child than you are to Amy.
Why don't you take off your hat and stay awhile?
I forgot I had it on.
Where is everybody?
It's early yet.
It's early yet.
It's nearly a quarter after four. The party was for four, wasn't it?

Gosh, in my day kids arrived at birthday parties before anybody was ready for them,

Times have changed.
Oilie, that's for the children to play with.
No kids yet. Something's gone wrong. Maybe I ought to call somebody.

All right, Ollie. Go ahead. Call the Boyds...3000W...see if their darling Donald has left.

I think I should. 3000W?

That's right.
Something's haywire,
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
I called not only the Boyds but the Irvings. Neither of them received invitations.
I called not only the Boyds but the Irvings. Neither of them received invitations.
But they must have. Amy and I made them out together. You mailed them, didn't you, Edward?
My, my, what a coil we're in! What's this all about?
Amy's been lying again.
Did you hear the child out?
Well, it seemed to me --
Well, it seemed to me --
You mean you didn't. It seems to me the least you could do. You can't just jump at conclusions that way. You're being unfair.
You mean you didn't. It seems to me the least you could do. You can't just jump at conclusions that way. You're being unfair.
I'm never unfair.
I'm never unfair.
You're shouting at me.
You're shouting at me.
I'm not shouting at you, but there's no doubt in my mind that you spoil this child!
What is it, Alice?
I thought Amy was calling. I guess not.
Ollie.
What?
What?
It's your play.
It's your play.
I'm sorry. I was somewhere else. He returns to the card game.
I haven't had my breakfast.
Well, you know where it is.
Where did you get it?
Amy picked it off the top of that stack. Perhaps you'd better go through the whole bunch. There may be others of Irena in there.
Some day I'm afraid we're going to have to tell her about Irena.
I suppose so.
What's funny?
That darn kid. I never in my life expected her to get an A in arithmetic. Math's is a practical science --- if she understands figures, she's well out of her own world of make-believe.
Oliver, please. Let's not go on with this. The child's trembling.
We've got to go on. Amy, here, all this time, you've let your mother and father think you had forgotten that old dream life of yours. Now we find you've only kept it secret.
I thought you were with Amy.
No, she went runnin' off to some old house she was talkin' about yesterday.

You do that, Edward.
It's late, Mommy -- you haven't forgotten my birthday party.
Your birthday, Amy -- as she goes) -- and I have something for you in my locker. A present.
Your birthday, Amy -- as she goes) -- and I have something for you in my locker. A present.
Mommy's having a party for me. I asked Robert, and Donald, and Lois --
Hello, Amy.
Are you coming to see us. Miss Callahan?
Are you coming to see us. Miss Callahan?
No, darling, I hadn't intended to.
No, darling, I hadn't intended to.
I live right here.
I live right here.
Maybe I'll drop in and see your Mommy.
I got lots of presents.
And you should. Your mommy tells me you've been such a good girl, and your daddy is so pleased with you.
Is that my birthday cake? May I see?
You'll see it when it's all lit and ready for you.
Amy, you remember the party invitations Edward, gave you to mail?
Yes, daddy.
Yes, daddy.
Did you mail then?
Did you mail then?
Yes, I did.
Yes, I did.
Where did you mail them?
Where did you mail them?
I'll show you.
Amy, not that old tree!
Yes, daddy.
Yes, daddy.
But I told you about that so long ago; you couldn't have been more than three when I told you that tree was a magic mailbox.
But I told you about that so long ago; you couldn't have been more than three when I told you that tree was a magic mailbox.
I didn't forget.
I didn't forget.
But, Amy, that was just a story; it wasn't real. That tree's no mailbox.
Amy, make a wish. Wish real hard, and then blow out the candles, and your wish will come true.
But wishes don't come true.
But wishes don't come true.
Certain wishes do.

But you told me in the garden-- that the wish about the tree couldn't come true.

But this is different. Go on blow,
What do you want. Amy?
I wanted to talk to you, I wanted to tell you about the other children.
I wanted to talk to you, I wanted to tell you about the other children.
Can't you tell me later?
Can't you tell me later?
But I didn't play with them, Daddy. They wouldn't play with me.
What do you mean you didn't play with the other children?
It was on account of the birthday party.
It was on account of the birthday party.
Because you didn't ask them? I don't blame them for being angry. Why didn't you explain what happened?

They ran away.
They ran away.
Why didn't you run after them?
Why didn't you run after them?
I did. I came to an old dark house, and a voice called to me -- a lovely, sweet voice ---
Now Amy
It's true.
It's true.
And who did the voice belong to?

It was just a voice.

Now look, this is the last time you come to me with any such stories  I'm sick of this sort of thing.
Now look, this is the last time you come to me with any such stories  I'm sick of this sort of thing.
Daddy, it's true.
Daddy, it's true.
Let me be the judge of that.
No, I didn't.
Voices from an old dark house!
I'm sorry. Daddy and Mommy are a little upset.
You're upset about me -- I made you fight --I hate for you to fight.
These are all from me.
This one says, "To Mother from Amy."
Just you wait!
And this one's for Mrs. Farren.
And this one's for Mrs. Farren.
She gave me a ring, so I'm giving her a ring. I paid twenty-five cents for it, too.
She gave me a ring, so I'm giving her a ring. I paid twenty-five cents for it, too.
This one hasn't got a name on it. Who's this one for, Amy?
Daddy!
Yes, Amy?
Yes, Amy?
Why, daddy, you know my friend too!
Amy, answer me. Why did you call her your friend?
Because she is my friend.
It isn't a secret. She plays with me. She plays with me in the garden all the time. Right out there in the garden, she does!
In the garden? Would she be there now?
In the garden? Would she be there now?
She's there whenever I call her!
She's there, just like I said she'd be.
Where, Amy? Where do you see her?
Where, Amy? Where do you see her?
Don't you see her?...Right there, under the tree.
Amy, there's nothing there. There's no one at all in the garden.
But Irena is in the garden. She's right there, under the tree.
But Irena is in the garden. She's right there, under the tree.
Listen, darling. I want you to look once more. Take as long as you want. Look very carefully, and then I want you to tell me that no one's there.
Listen, darling. I want you to look once more. Take as long as you want. Look very carefully, and then I want you to tell me that no one's there.
But...
But...
I have eyes too, and I tell you no one's there. If you deny that, if you insist that this woman you call your friend is in the garden, then I'm afraid I shall have to punish you. Do you understand?
Yes, she was afraid. She said there was someone who wanted to kill me.
But there's no one here, darling.
But there's no one here, darling.
She's upstairs.. .the lady who lives up there.
Daddy?
Yes, darling.
Yes, darling.
Tell me tha real truth. You can see my friend, can't you?
What'd you get for Christmas?
I don't know yet.
I don't know yet.
My goodness, don't you open your presents until Christmas morning?

No, I don't think that's very much fun. Let's play house instead. You be the friend who comes to see me. I'll show you my children.
Your children?

My dolls. We can pretend.
All right, Amy. Button your sweater, darling. It's turning cold.
Yes, winter's coming. I don't like the winter,
Yes, winter's coming. I don't like the winter,
Oh, but the winter's fun. There's the wind and the snow. You'll like the warm fire upon the hearth, and the long, long nights.
Merry Christmas, Irena. I brought you a present.
Oh, thank you, Amy.
Oh, thank you, Amy.
You can open it now, I guess. Lois Huggins says that's proper,

She's dead! I know what it is now when people say somebody died. I know what they mean! And I'm afraid. She's dead; she's dead!
You mustn't be afraid.
But she's dead!

Death's like life. Death's a part of life. It isn't frightening. It isn't the end of everything. It isn't quiet and nothingness. It's a part of all eternity.
Getting the yard all fixed up for your party, Amy. You'd better hurry and get yourself fixed up too.
Mommy's taking me upstairs to change my dress right away.

A ring that I can wish on like I wished on the candles?
Maybe, if it's a real mourning ring like we have in Jamaica. All you got to do is turn it on your finger, close your eyes, and make a wish.

They're given to the living in memory of the dead. If this is a real one -- I can't be sure -- you can make a wish, and it will come true in the twinkling of an eye.

Well, if it's a real mourning ring,. I'm going to think hard for something I want more than anything else in the world before I wish.

That's the clever way to do it.
Been crying? That won't please your Daddy. You'd bettor cheer yourself up.
I'm trying to.
I'm trying to.
Let me take another look at that ring.
I wasn't singing to myself.
Oh, I suppose it was to the wind you sang, or maybe to the sun, or the clouds, or maybe it was to the flowers in the garden.
Little miss, you're stopping me in my work.
But I want to talk to you. Mommy says for you to come up to the old house with me. I've got to take back this ring.

You just wait until I finish here. I've got to dust these ships for your Dad.

Will you come soon?
Will you come soon?
Soon as I finish.
You're going to be busy all day long, Edward.
I do suppose so. But if you were there yesterday, guess you can get there today.
I do suppose so. But if you were there yesterday, guess you can get there today.
That means I can go alone?
About time for you to come home, Amy.
But Mrs. Farren just started to tell me a story. Please.
Little miss, don't you never come here alone. You gave me a fright, you did.
But she's such a nice lady.
But she's such a nice lady.
But I don't want you coming here alone. You get me to go with you when you want to come here. You promise?
There was a deer on the other side of the fence.
It's a hard winter. All the animals are bold as brass, coming down into the streets for food. You'll see a lot of deer this winter.
Mustn't look, little miss. Mustn't look.
But I saw what it was. It's the little deer.
Bad luck to see death in the snow.
But what happened to the little deer?
But what happened to the little deer?
Probably hit by a car. Hard to see things in the twilight.

Why is it just lying there? Why doesn't it get up?
Why is it just lying there? Why doesn't it get up?
Because it can't. It's dead.
Because it can't. It's dead.
But it was alive  it was fast and strong!
But it was alive  it was fast and strong!
It got hit.
It got hit.
But where has it gone? Where's all the strength and the quickness?
I've been watching you. You couldn't see me, but I could see you. It was like peeking through a slit in the curtain before the play began. You would be a very good audience. I can see that.
If you were the lady who gave me a ring, my mother says I have to give it back to you.
If you were the lady who gave me a ring, my mother says I have to give it back to you.
Return it to me? Indeed you may not. I gave it to you as a present.
But my mother says I mustn't accept gifts from strangers.
Stranger? Julia Farren a stranger. Why I've played every theatre from Boston to San Francisco. I've been to London and Paris. Those days  those beautiful, shilling, golden days.

She's always spying on me. She creeps into the room. She lives upstairs, yet she's always watching me  always!
Who is she?
Who is she?
That woman is an imposter, a liar, and a cheat. How do you like your tea? </PRE><PRE> AMY Well... .sometimes I got a spoonful of tea in a cup of hot milk.
There you are. Take some cake, why don't you?
No, thank you.
No, thank you.
One little piece of cake won't hurt you. Go ahead, take one. It's full of fruit...citron, cherries and ginger. It'll make you dream. Yes, wonderful dreams.
I like stories.
Then I'll tell you a story  a lovely story. Do you know the story of Rapunzel?

It was shot off long ago in the great battles that were fought here; with the British on one side and the Americans on the other.
He'll let me stay, Mrs. Farren. He'll let me stay.
Good.
I brought you a present. Merry Christmas.
A Christmas present. It's been so long since I've had a Christmas present.
What?
Don't you hear it?
Who's Herne the Huntsman?
Don't you read Shakespeare?
And does he kill people?
No, not people -- just deer and game, but the people he catches can never be free again. They too must kill and kill, covering themselves with blood.
Hide me? Why?
My little girl said she'd kill you if you came to see me. I can't let you die. We'll have to hide you.
Hurry, hurry.
Yes, yes -
Hurry!
I can't do it! I can't do it!
My daughter, Barbara, died when she was six. That was long ago. You're only the woman who keeps care of me. I know you.
Look at me.
You didn't even open my present and I'm your daughter.
My daughter died long ago.
I hate the storm. I hate it!
The storms have done everything they can to me, I don't hate them. I don't even hear the wind. It blows beyond me. It was on such a night as this that Barbara died.

But I am Barbara. I didn't die.
But I am Barbara. I didn't die.
My Barbara was killed. I killed her. Yes, it was my fault. Everyone told me not to drive from the theatre. There was a raging wind that night, and snow and ice. All was well until we got to the Sleepy Hollow bridge. Barbara was singing a little song and then ...I don't know how it happened ..when I awakened, they told me the
Oh, doesn't that prove something to you? Doesn't it?
Anybody could know that song.
Look at me. Look at me, mother darling. Look into my eyes. What color eyes did Barbara have?
Gray. They were a lovely, lovely gray.
Gray. They were a lovely, lovely gray.
And my eyes...my eyes are gray. Look! You see!
And my eyes...my eyes are gray. Look! You see!
Yes...yes, that's true.
Yes...yes, that's true.
And my hair...what color hair did Barbara have?
And my hair...what color hair did Barbara have?
It was pale...a shadowed gold.
Mother! You called me by name!
Yes, Barbara... Barbara...
Promise me you won't forget tomorrow. You'll remember, won't you? You won't say that it was just a dream. Promise me.
Yes. Yes, Barbara, I shan't forget.
There's another promise you must make me. That little girl who comes here...she mustn't ever come to see you again. Promise me you won't see her.
I-shan't see her. No, Barbara, no.
I-shan't see her. No, Barbara, no.
If that child comes here...if I find her trying to steal your love from me...I'll kill her. Yes, I'll kill her:
If that child comes here...if I find her trying to steal your love from me...I'll kill her. Yes, I'll kill her:
I'll not see her, Barbara. I promise.
Good night, mother, good night.
Good night...Barbara...
Let the child stay.
Now, I don't know Amy --
On the dark nights  on the stormy nights -- you can hear him. He passes like the wind; The flapping and fluttering of his great cloak beating like gaunt wings. The thunder of his horse's hooves is loud, loud and louder, beating hard, beating strong on the frozen ground as he comes riding, riding, riding.
Little miss, you can't stay here. You've got to come with me.
...At the hour of midnight, down the road that goes through Sleepy Hollow, across the bridge, he goes galloping, galloping, always searching, always seeking
Come away, Amy.
There's a present you haven't opened yet, ma'am.
That's from her -- that woman.
It's some animal hurt in the woods that made that sound.
Wait a minute. Listen.
What is it, ma'am?

It's dark. We'd better be getting on. The family will be waiting.
Such a brief visit, but dear child, it has made my Christmas very merry.
Everything all right down there at the school, Mr. Reed?
Yes, everything's all right, Edward.
Yes, everything's all right, Edward.
When I first heard all that talk about you going down to the school to see the teacher I got really afeard. I thought maybe you night call off this birthday party -- and me with the cake already in the oven.
When I first heard all that talk about you going down to the school to see the teacher I got really afeard. I thought maybe you night call off this birthday party -- and me with the cake already in the oven.
I imagine a child would have to commit murder or rob the Seventh National Bank of Tarrytown to be deprived of a birthday party.
I thought we were going to save those leaves you were burning for the compost bin.
Got more leaf mold now than we'll ever need, Mr. Reed. I thought I'd burn 'em up and get the yard clean.
You won't have long to wait. In just a few minutes this house will be overflowing with boys and girls. Off with you now, Amy. Go out and watch from the gate for all the children who'll be coming.
Go on -- out with you.
Well, ma'am, the truth is, I gave them to Amy hersolf to post.
And Amy mailed them?
And Amy mailed them?
She pleaded so to do it
Amy looks happy  seems almost as if she were playing with another child; like somebody else were running with her and playing.
I like to see her happy.
I like to see her happy.
So do I, Mr. Reed.
I didn't even have to coax her tonight.
That's because she made a promise, and she'a keeping it, aren't you, darling. You saw the way she played this afternoon, Edward.
That's because she made a promise, and she'a keeping it, aren't you, darling. You saw the way she played this afternoon, Edward.
Indeed I did. Up and down the garden she went, laughing and singing to herself.
"To Daddy from Amy." Here's one for Miss Callahan. This one says, "To Edward from Amy.".
Good heavens! What could you be giving me. Little Miss?
I know it may seem stupid of me--but it isn't the slap I'm worried about -- it's the reason.
Something to do with a butterfly-- they were quarreling about it.
Something to do with a butterfly-- they were quarreling about it.
No. Amy slapped Donald because he had hurt the butterfly -- and it was her friend.
No. Amy slapped Donald because he had hurt the butterfly -- and it was her friend.
Well, that seems a harmless fancy --
Well, that seems a harmless fancy --
Amy has too many fancies -- too few friends. It worries me. It doesn't seem normal.
You'd better hurry. I've left Amy in the car and she's getting impatient. She tells me there's something especially important about a sixth birthday.
We'll see that she gets there in good time
She refuses to deny it. She continues to believe in her lies.
But don't you see...it's just what I was about to say to Alice...Amy in her own mind may not be lying.
But don't you see...it's just what I was about to say to Alice...Amy in her own mind may not be lying.
But there was nothing, no one in the garden.
But there was nothing, no one in the garden.
She needed, a companion, so out of her own hunger she created one. In her mind her friend was in the garden. In her mind her friend never leaves her. Right this very minute I'm sure she's upstairs sobbing out her grief to a friend who exists only in her mind.
But we have. She's wanted for nothing.
Perhaps she's wanted for understanding.
It all starts with them going to the bathroom together.

Sorry about Frida. She's been friends with Jen forever.
What's with her? If they're not bleeding they're PMSing. If they're not PMSing, they're warning you about the impending doom. If you're lucky, you get a sane person one week a month. Then you gotta date three or four women just to get some normalcy in your life.
I'm lucky Jen's not like that.
I don't believe in PMS. Women made it up just so they can be bitchy.

My brother has an answer to PMS. A-S-S: Abundant Sperm Syndrome. A man gets sperm build-up, and if his woman isn't givin' it to 'em, he's gotta get it elsewhere.

Waiter! She needs more water.

No way is that the same chick. The other one was a dog.

Sorry, don't mean to be wolfing down. I'm just starving.
Sorry, don't mean to be wolfing down. I'm just starving.
Don't apologize. It's great to see a woman really enjoying her food. I hate it when I buy a woman dinner and she won't even touch it.
No one I've run into knows what "coyote ugly" means.
Maybe that bartender made it up. I mean I think coyotes are rather beautiful. Maybe "coyote ugly" is really a compliment. Like someone who's conventionally "ugly" but is really beautiful.

Yeah that's like a three bagger. Today a bag is also a condom, so now a three bagger can be a chick that's really hot. So hot you gotta put several condoms on to dull the senses.
Sorry I didn't recognize you earlier. You look so different.
I've changed a lot lately.
You shouldn't smoke. It'll kill you.
Yeah yeah I know. Smoking kills. I'll quit someday. Doesn't it seem like all the cool people smoke?

What the hell is the tampon test?

You're at his place, and you come out of the bathroom looking all shy and say, "I'm so embarrassed but could you run out and get me some tampons?" If he says no, he's too embarrassed, then you know he's a wus. If he says he's got some in the bathroom, then you know there are other women around a lot. But if he
I'm freaking out. I'm like an animal and totally out of control. My arms keep getting really hairy.
You have to stop being so self- critical Frida.

I looked like an Italian man!
How'd it go with the cop?
We almost slept together... and... then the hair started and I booked.

Frida, this hair thing is all in your head. You're using it as an excuse not to get close to anyone.

It's just as well. I'm afraid of getting hurt again. Mark seemed great at first too. I don't want to get too attached to Peter and then find out he's a creep.

Hey, Carlton's in town -- come out with the three of us.
No he didn't. Come on, I don't want to be alone with those two. All they talk about is basketball and it bores the hell out of me.
Okay. I guess so.
Okay. I guess so.
Great. George is meeting Carlton first for drinks. We can meet and go together. It'll be a blast.
I started out on that eye-of-newt diet the doctor gave me and wound up in the tub covered in chocolate.
Well whatever it was, seems to have worked cause you look great.

You're just saying that.
What did he say?
I think he called you beautiful.
I think he called you beautiful.
Oh my god. I've never had that before. I've had guys say they want me to suck their dicks and gross stuff but no one's ever said "Hey there beautiful."
Charming Carlton.
It is so hot in here.
Bag means condom now? I can't keep up with the word "bag." It used to be "No, that's not my bag" -- meaning not my thing. But now "my bag" means "my fault."
I still thought it was a purse.
You might want to tape your nipples down next time. It's really distracting.
I can't help it. My bra wouldn't even fit. I've been going to Victoria's Secret and exchanging bras for bigger ones and still I'm busting out. It's this PMS.

Geez, I wish I'd get it like that.
Geez, I wish I'd get it like that.
No you don't, believe me.
Oh my god, look. My arms are so hairy!
No they're not.
Yes they are! Look how much more hair I have than you!
It's just cause mine is finer. A little bleach'll fix that.

I look like fuckin' Chewbacca.
Frida, this is a bad time. We're having sex and George actually answered the phone.
There is a man's arm in my bed.
Jennifer. A severed arm. It's bloody and... I'm not sure but it may be Carlton's.
You fucked Carlton? See I told you he liked you.
You fucked Carlton? See I told you he liked you.
No! Not fucked him, I think I killed him.
Please come over. I'm begging you. What should I do with the arm? Should I call the cops or... Peter?
Frida, you're not making sense. I can't come over right now.
So where's this infamous arm now?
I put it down the garbage disposal.

And what makes you think you killed a man?

Because of PMS, I get hairy, my nails turn into claws, I eat raw meat, I roam the city hunting for flesh. I've become a werewolf!
You're a PMS werewolf. Of course. Frida, are you on drugs?
No, last night I think I chased Carlton around as a wolf and killed him. I woke up with a taste of blood in my mouth and a severed arm in my bed. And my throat hurts.
You're delusional. Maybe you had a bad dream and bit your lip -- so you tasted blood. And the severed arm... well I don't see it and... maybe this is all in your head.
It took me an hour to clean it up. That was not in my head!

Maybe the blood was from your period like before.

Frida, listen to yourself. If I said I was a werewolf, would you believe me?
Frida, listen to yourself. If I said I was a werewolf, would you believe me?
I don't know. You have to take Sammy. He's afraid of me.
Hello?
Frida? I was worried to death about you. I've called you for two days. Where have you been?

Shit, I guess I missed work.

Frida, Carlton's dead.

Oh no.

And he was missing an arm.

Oh my god Jennifer. I should go to confession.
Oh my god Jennifer. I should go to confession.
Relax. Carlton was torn apart. No way could you have done that. Maybe you saw someone kill him and blocked it out... or...
Get rid of him!
Okay, I gotta go.
Okay, I gotta go.
I'm stopping by later. I'm worried about you. Bye.
Holy shit, I don't know.
Did you get rid of Mark?

I don't know... I'm spaced out... he was taking a shower... He must be still in there.

He's been here all night?

Yeah, I guess. Mark?
What happened to his tooth?
I should call the police. Oh no Peter. Peter is the police!

DON'T call the police.

Why not? There's been a murder.

First of all, you're my alibi. I told George I was with you last night.

You're cheating on George? Jennifer, how could you?
How could I? I'm helping you clean up Mark's remains and you ask how could I cheat on George?
You're right. It's just, I can't cover up a murder so George won't know you're cheating.
You're right. It's just, I can't cover up a murder so George won't know you're cheating.
You say murder, but you have no idea what happened. You don't remember doing it, so it's out of your control.
