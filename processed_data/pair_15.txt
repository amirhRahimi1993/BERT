Just get him to stop.
What do you want to do, leave the station with her?
What do you want to do, leave the station with her?
Yes.
Yes.
Kelvin, she'll disintegrate. You don't believe me? Let's radio that shuttle pod you launched -- better yet, let's go get it. I've charted it's trajectory, only take a few hours...

Her oxygen would have run out.
Her oxygen would have run out.
Maybe she doesn't need any. Should we check?
Who are you trying to please? Yourself? Her? Which her, this one or that one. Can you face both? We are in a situation that is beyond morality. So: Leave with her. You'll see the transformation.
Into what?
Into what?
You'll see her die, that's all. They're mortal, despite what she told you. She will die. Then what will you do?
You'll see her die, that's all. They're mortal, despite what she told you. She will die. Then what will you do?
I love her.
I love her.
You do, you don't. She's willing to give her life, you're willing to give yours, it's touching and magnificent, anything you want but -- this isn't the place for it. Don't you see? No, you don't.
What's wrong with you? We need your help.
I won't be making the trip.
When did this happen?
Oh, right away. That's why you never saw me with anyone. You should've noticed that. I miss him, though. I think I made a mistake.

Jesus...
Jesus...
But I can't leave with you. I won't make it.
But I can't leave with you. I won't make it.
Maybe you can.
Oh, God. I'm awake.
Yes.
I need to see Snow.
I'll go with you.
I'll go with you.
I'll just be a minute.
Don't.
Why?
Why?
I don't know. I can't be alone.
I don't know. I can't be alone.
I'll be right back.
What are they?
To calm your anxiety.

To calm my anxiety.
We're taking a flight?
Yes.
Rheya...
I want you inside me right now.
"And Death Shall Have No Dominion".
Book?
Book?
Poem. Dylan Thomas. I thought of it when I saw you on the train.

My Thomas is a little rusty.
Not a very happy poem.
You didn't look very happy.
You didn't look very happy.
I wasn't.
I wasn't.
And tonight?
And tonight?
Better.
You want to fuck her?
Stop it.
Stop it.
You behave as though you want to fuck her.

Rheya. Not here.
Rheya. Not here.
And I just want to know if I'm crazy or not -- if what I think is happening is actually happening. Or am I one of those people, those women, who are blind to what's going on? Who pretend not to see their husband's attention toward another woman?

You go home.
You go home.
I am. Please come with me. I don't want to do this here.
I am. Please come with me. I don't want to do this here.
You talk like an actor.
You're better when you take them.
I know, I know. But still, somehow I don't feel better.
I know, I know. But still, somehow I don't feel better.
All right. How about I feel better when you take them?
What do you remember?
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
Do you remember Beethoven? The Beatles? Movies, books, restaurants, friends?
Do you remember Beethoven? The Beatles? Movies, books, restaurants, friends?
Yes. But not until you mentioned them. As soon as you said those things, I remembered them. And they have associations that make me think of other things I remember. It's like filling up.
Is it a planet?
Not exactly. It exists in a continuum that wasn't proven until ten years ago, a higher mathematical dimension superimposed on top of the Universe. An infinite number of them, in fact. It was a violation of all of our various laws regarding the Universe, Space, or Space-Time. It was completely counter-intuitive. We had to unlearn everything.

It's something.

You still don't believe in God?
You still don't believe in God?
The whole idea of God was dreamed up by a silly animal with a small brain called Man. Even the limits we put on it are human limits. It can do this, it can do that! It designs, it creates!

You're talking about a man in a white beard again. You're ascribing human characteristics to something that isn't human. Human beings look for causes and patterns. How could we know what Solaris is up to, if anything?
But what if Solaris is what there was before The Big Bang?
As I said, it is beyond our comprehension.

What happened?
You were trying to break down the door. Do you know why?
You were trying to break down the door. Do you know why?
When I saw you were gone I got scared.
Where've you been?
I been thinking about how much I hate you.
I would have these -- I don't know how to describe them -- visions, when I was younger. Maybe not visions, but like these waking dream states. Time would just collapse, I would be inside time. I would stare at a second hand on a clock until it stopped. Freaky stuff.
How old were you?
How old were you?
Seven, eight. So one day my mother catches me sort of staring off into space, and she asks me what I'm doing, and I start trying to explain to her, about this state that I can put myself in, and this look comes over her face.

What kind of look?
Scared. No, not scared. Wary. Like I was something to be... her guard went up. I was a threat. Now I know why. She was afraid she'd be seen. That I would see her for the self-obsessed neurotic that she was. I think she thought she had a few more years of being on a pedestal. But that's the cycle, right? I knew a
I know. I know. We don't have to talk about that.
Thinking what you were doing and saying, just being consumed by thinking of you. I loved it so much, that feeling.
I did too.
What happened to us, exactly?
You don't know?
Why did you say those things?
I don't know. I couldn't understand why you didn't tell me.
I can't help feeling that I'm cheating when I take them.
It's genetics. You know this. You know where it comes from. There is nothing wrong with uncrossing a few crossed wires.
Do you have any idea how much I like fucking you?
I think so.
I think so.
Good. Because I want you to know. I really like fucking you.
I like that too.
How could she not be real? I can smell her, taste her. She does exactly what she did... it's not possible.
How could she not be real? I can smell her, taste her. She does exactly what she did... it's not possible.
You know, I've decided: I'm just gonna believe what you believe about this whole Solaris thing, it'll make life so much easier; the little wife agreeing with her big, strong husband. You must get such a headache thinking about those Great Big Problems all day.
You sure say "God" a lot when we're doing it.
I know. I'm putting that in my next report.
What does Snow think you should do?
Snow thinks we shouldn't leave until we figure out a way to document it, to prove its existence to the planet Earth. This is hilarious: He thinks it's God, but he wants it to sit still for a photograph so he can show the folks back home.
Sartorius wants to destroy it.
Well. He doesn't think it's God, but for different reasons than me. He's thinking: If I can figure out how to make it stop, than I am smarter than it is, and therefore it cannot be God.

He does have a point. That's just not the way I'd like to see it proven.

You feel sorry for Solaris, or for me?

It's a violent response to something we haven't figured out. Don't let the cowardly demeanor fool you: He is ruthless. Unblinking in his prejudice.

It was obvious from the way he first looked at me.
Do I really feel like... I am...?
Yes. Yes.
Yes. Yes.
I'm glad.
What's wrong.
You don't love me.
You don't love me.
Stop.
What are you talking about?
That I am not Rheya. That Rheya died. Killed herself. I'm different.
Who have you been talking to?
Sartorius.
Sartorius.
When? When I'm asleep?
I'm sure there are worse people to talk to, but I don't know who they are.
I'm just trying to understand what's going on.
But we fought.
Yes. Especially toward the end.
Yes. Especially toward the end.
Why did she do it?
Why did she do it?
You... she said I didn't love her.
You... she said I didn't love her.
Was she right?
Was she right?
No. I love you.
No. I love you.
I love you, too.
Can you sleep?
I don't think do. It's not sleep; it's something else. It's all around me.
I don't think do. It's not sleep; it's something else. It's all around me.
Those are dreams.
You're the coward.
Don't debate him; he'll say anything.
Don't debate him; he'll say anything.
I'm just as human as you. I see, I hear, I touch, and I feel just like you do.
You don't want me.
Rheya.
Rheya.
That's what you were saying. I heard what you were saying.
That's what you were saying. I heard what you were saying.
For a reason that neither of us understand, you are forced to stay near me. That's all I know right now.
I have these strange thoughts, I don't know where they come from. I can't explain it.
Neither can I. Not any of it. There's no reference point for what's going on; it's never happened before. It's a clean break in the fabric of the Universe; a gap. There is nothing to do but experience it, moment-to- moment, and not let it destroy us.

Do you?
Do you?
If you're here.
What's wrong?
Gibarian. He was here.
Gibarian. He was here.
You said he was dead.
You said he was dead.
He is. But he was here...
What's happening to us?
It's all right.
It's all right.
Please don't lie. I told you before, I don't know how I came to be here. Whatever you think you can't say to me, I need to hear you say it.
Please don't lie. I told you before, I don't know how I came to be here. Whatever you think you can't say to me, I need to hear you say it.
I love you.
I love you.
Don't. I'm the one at risk here. If we're playing out what happened before, I won't survive.
That won't happen again. We're different.
How can I tell? You've seen both of me. I only know what you're like here. You're all I know. There is no "You" from before.
How could it be so cruel? How could it torture us like this?
I don't think it knows it's torturing us. It's just watching.
I'm not Rheya. You've always known that.
Rheya --
Rheya --
Don't call me that.
Listen: I don't care about anything but the fact that you are here. You are her, you are Rheya.
I'm disgusting.
I'm disgusting.
No.
No.
You're lying. I'm not human.
You're lying. I'm not human.
Rheya, I am not going back. I'm staying here with you.
Rheya, I am not going back. I'm staying here with you.
Then you'll die.
Then you'll die.
I want every second I can get with you.
Don't do this. I am literally begging you not to do this. Chris.
You should have told me.
You should have told me.
It wouldn't have made any difference.
It wouldn't have made any difference.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Chris, I had to. I had to. I didn't think you'd react like this.

Neither did I.

I can't stay here.
I can't stay here.
Chris, please. Chris, I'm serious. I won't make it.
Chris, please. Chris, I'm serious. I won't make it.
Then you won't make it.
What do I have to do to stop it?
I want you here.
I want you here.
You're lying.
You're lying.
You exist here. I keep telling you.
You exist here. I keep telling you.
That's impossible. I'm not Rheya.

Who are you, then?

Yes, you are --

Did you hear what Gibarian said? I'm not a human being. I'm an instrument. I came from your memory and your imagination and I will torture you no matter what. Even if I remain passive. That's when I drank the... I was going mad. It felt like there was no body underneath my skin. There was something else. An illusion. But I could feel

But then I would be dead now.
Is that really what you want?

It put you here. I'll admit it, it acted like a God and put you here, put you into my consciousness. I was asleep, and it put you into my dream. I saw your mouth. And there you were. Whether you've been sent here to make me happy or punish me, it doesn't matter. The decision we make now is all that matters. Stay

Am I really her?
Am I really her?
I don't know anymore. All I see is you.
What are you taking?
A sleeping pill. Do you want yours?
What does it want?
I don't know. Something. Anything.
I've decided that if it is God, it's a sick God. Its ambitions exceed its powers, but it doesn't realize it. It's created a situation without a goal, and I hate that. A God whose passion is not a redemption, who saves nothing, fulfills no purpose. And us? We would have to have "an arrangement". An unspoken understanding that I am not human. How
Please. Don't.
Where did you go before?
When?
When?
Last night. You were talking to someone in the corridor.

He won't.
We thought you'd be alone. We want to talk about...

They are not autonomous individuals and they're not actual persons. They are projections materializing from our minds, based on a given individual.
It's an experiment.
A recoil, with no compensating mechanism.

Are the actions of Solaris premeditated?
Gibarian was under enormous --
Gibarian was helpless. It's very simple: Man created the science that resulted in the discovery of Solaris, and the ship that brought us here.
Snow, get up here, now.
I'm not Snow.
I got rid of him. I wanted to see if... I wanted to be the only one. I wanted to be Snow.
Fuck me. I knew it.
You want it coming back with us?
You go ahead. Of what I remember about Earth... it's all one thing now. Everything's a blur. I like distinctions.
Claire!

Then c'mon. Follow me. The art's in the basement, you're going to get a privileged peek.
I've never seen anyone killed before.
It's okay... I've never been a detective before either...
Straight ahead.
Hard to find doors in this place.
Hi.
I'm sorry. I'm not sure how this works. I have to go out... is that all right?

There's a phone in the car.
Do you have another tie? Something more conservative?
Oh... Yes... I don't have it with me. It's at home.
What did he say?
He thinks you're being a little careless. He made the point several times.
You live in Manhattan?
Queens... You know Queens?
Queens... You know Queens?
My father founded a music school there. The Milton Gregory School.
I'm supposed to speak at their tenth anniversary.
Nice. Maybe you'll stop by... have an aperitif...
Are you nervous?
No, Ma'am.
Would you pick one out, please?
Beg pardon?
Beg pardon?
Since you're going to be my escort, you'll need a new tie.
Put it on my account, please.
I got money.
You can touch me, I won't bite.
Not too sure about that.
People think I'm stepping out on Neil. We're causing quite a scandal.
Hey! There are crazy people here.

Let's get a drink.
Let's get a drink.
Ah... I shouldn't... on duty.
I'll have a spritzer, order something soft for yourself... I must go for a pee.
I'll come with you.
I'll come with you.
I think I can probably do that on my own.
Hi. Just checking to see if you're here.
I came on at 8:00.
You all right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm sorry about what happened.
I'm sorry about what happened.
Listen, that was my fault.

I shouldn't have listened to you, I should've followed you right into the "can" the way he did.
I shouldn't have listened to you, I should've followed you right into the "can" the way he did.
If I had known I was going to have company, he was right next to me. I think he heard me peeing! I hate that, I am glad he's in jail.
I guess I'm supposed to do it in the morning. Identify him.
Sooner, the better.
Sooner, the better.
He said he'd kill me.
He said he'd kill me.
Big talk... Desperate guy.

Yeah, I like that! Where you go, I follow.
You mean to tell me, a mugger would stay away from someone because they walked a certain way?
Absolutely. Look at this.
That's the dumbest walk I ever saw!
No, no seriously! There's a study done on this, you walk this way, the muggers are gonna single you out.
No, no seriously! There's a study done on this, you walk this way, the muggers are gonna single you out.
And die laughing, because you're walking so stupid!

So it was "love".
So it was "love".
Yeah. It was.
Yeah. It was.
And "is"...?
Yeah.
That's nice. And you live in Queens? With a child, and a dog...?

I'll miss you, Mike...
It was nice having you "watch over me"...
Yeah. I liked being around you too... Claire.
Good night, Mike.
Sleep good.
Claire?
What do you want?
What do you want?
Open the door, will you?
Open the door, will you?
I can't open it.
I can't open it.
It's just me. I want to talk to you. Let me in...
You put me life in danger.
No, you'll be safe. We're gonna pick him up again...
No, you'll be safe. We're gonna pick him up again...
And then what? I'll never be safe. I'll have to leave the country! You can't protect me, and you can't keep him in jail! And you knew that all the goddamn time!
You told me I'm safe? I'm going for a walk in the park.
Claire, will you calm down?
Claire, will you calm down?
I'm perfectly calm, I'm a normal human being. I'm going for a walk in the park.
I'm perfectly calm, I'm a normal human being. I'm going for a walk in the park.

Stop, will you?!
Let go!
Let go!
Stop being nuts!
Stop being nuts!
I trusted you! I thought you cared about me?!
I trusted you! I thought you cared about me?!
I do care about you!

More bullshit! More bullshit! What kind of odds are they giving me? There must be some kind of office pool. One month? A couple of days?
Yeah.
They called here after you left...

You don't wash your clothes at the Boulevard Laundromat... you don't pick up your kids from some crummy public school... what is this? A fuckin' joke?
Okay, then let's make it easy. It was a mistake. Don't make me feel guilty now that it's over, let's forget about it.
You told her?
Not exactly.
Not exactly.
What do you want to do?
What do you want to do?
I don't know.
You don't want to know.
Oh, I do want to know. I tried to reach you at the precinct.

Oh God, that's great!
Oh God, that's great!
Are you okay?
Are you okay?
Oh, I'm fine. They've replaced you with quite an entourage. It's a regular "marching band". You should see me on the street, you'd think I was the First Lady --
I'm taking them all out to Queens, as a matter of fact, right in your neighborhood. There's an event at my Father's school... an anniversary... I thought maybe you could come...
Oh that thing in Queens.
Oh that thing in Queens.
I'm going away after that, the next morning.
Where?
Pretty far. I'm told not to say anything about it on the phone, in case it's tapped... they think it's best, safer, if I go away, at least till Venza's found.
When can I see you?
I don't know. Garber's left orders here not to let you in the building.
Oh yeah. When is it? This thing in Queens.
Tomorrow night. Can you come?
Tomorrow night. Can you come?
I don't know. It wouldn't be very smart.
I don't know. It wouldn't be very smart.
Listen, you're right. Don't do it. I'll just... send you an address, okay?
Claire...
No really, it's okay, I've gotta go. I'm expecting some calls. I'll be fine, really.
No really, it's okay, I've gotta go. I'm expecting some calls. I'll be fine, really.
I'll think about Wednesday.
What a memory.
Do you dance?

Pretty bad.

Let's do it.
They guys treatin' you all right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I've been doing a lot of thinking.
I've been doing a lot of thinking.
I know.
It wouldn't work.
I know.
I'd miss my life...
... Don't explain.
How long you going away for?
Long enough.
Long enough.
"For"...?
"For"...?
"To"... Forget about you.
I'll have to pack a lot of clothes.
Yeah...
... Mike.
It's Venza. He wants you. You, for Ellie and Tommy.
Claire!
Mike...?
Everyone's all right...?
Yeah. It's all over.
So.
So.
You still going away?
I don't know...
I don't know...
You don't have to, now.
You don't have to, now.
I think it's probably still a good idea.
I'll miss you, Mike.
Listen, I'll... see you again.
I like your coat.
You have a weakness for Lady Cops.
You have a weakness for Lady Cops.
I do.
Say goodbye, Mike.
You take care.
Hello, Claire. How extraordinary that you came.
It was something my father always liked me to do.

You're planning to speak?

Not if you don't want me to.
Not if you don't want me to.
Well, of course, we'd be... honored...
Well, of course, we'd be... honored...
Just putting in an appearance then.
... just saying you should think twice about it...
... I don't want to talk about it...
... You know, and I know, that the only thing standing between a life sentence for Venza and his freedom is my testimony at his trial...
Claire...
Claire...
... He killed Win... he enjoyed it...
... He killed Win... he enjoyed it...
Win made his choices, Claire. We all do --
Win made his choices, Claire. We all do --
And I'm making mine.
You're dealing with a psychopath. He gets out of jail in ten years, or five... or ninety days, and you'll be looking over your shoulder for the rest of your life...
What am I supposed to do?! I saw one of my oldest friends get killed! And I saw who did it! I can't just -- "let it go away"!!
What am I supposed to do?! I saw one of my oldest friends get killed! And I saw who did it! I can't just -- "let it go away"!!
Claire...
Keep what handy?
Nothing.
Nothing.
The gun? It's in the upstairs closet.
We're not going to the game, are we Mom?
Sure we are, let's go!
Mom, what's going to happen with you and Dad?
I don't know Tommy.
Hey, can we go to McDonald's?
Absolutely.
Tommy...!
I'm all right.
Think I should put the skateboard in bed with him?
Too kinky.
Ellie, you know I think it's about time we got outa this place, get us a house of our own. We can afford it now.
Amen to that. The supermarket's full of assholes.
Amen to that. The supermarket's full of assholes.
Take my advice, don't buy any...

Tomorrow, I start looking for our house... You love me?
You got no idea...
You got no idea...
Imagine... I'm sleepin' with a DT.
So how'd it go?
Not great. I've got a babysitting job for a material witness on a homicide.
For how long?
'Til they pick up the perp. Seniority gets day shift... You know what that means.
Don't start... The only reason is that the neighborhood's shi... ... crummy. I just don't like the idea of leaving you alone here at night.
I can still use a gun.
I can still use a gun.
Just keep it someplace safe, but handy.
Changing the sparks. They showed it on TV. What d'you think?
I think television's a dangerous thing.

It's twenty bucks in the bank.
Hey. The neighbors.
Let 'em eat their hearts out.
I read the article. You didn't tell me she was so beautiful.
Well, actually, she looks better than that.
Okay?
Unbelievably handsome. You look fantastic in a suit.
The real estate lady left, she couldn't wait anymore. What took you?
Oh, some shit.
Oh, some shit.
What shit, honey?
What shit, honey?
You don't want to hear about it.
Honey. You got him.
I don't know that Ellie. He might get out. Garber's not bein' straight with the witness, she could be in deep shit if she identifies him, and it's my job to convince her she won't be.
I don't know that Ellie. He might get out. Garber's not bein' straight with the witness, she could be in deep shit if she identifies him, and it's my job to convince her she won't be.
She's got to identify him.
She's got to identify him.
Why?
Why?
Because the the only way to stop crime is to identify criminals. I can't believe you're talking this way Mister Detective -- I think she's got a lot of guts.

Should I wait up? We've got to get up early for the beach tomorrow.
I'll be right up.
What?
Goddamn Venza assaulted a taxi driver in the Bronx, thirteen months ago. It's coming to court and the judge let him walk because of the pending case law.
Mike, take it easy...
Take it easy! I set her up. I saw it coming.
Take it easy! I set her up. I saw it coming.
It's not your fault. Mike, please get off the case.

Did you hear what I said?

Did you hear what I said?!!
I'm sorry. I know I heard noises... the detective's wife...
I want you and Tommy to stay with my mother.
C'mon, don't make an issue of it. Do you want the fucking meatloaf or not?
D'you have to say "fucking" every other word?

What're you talking about --

I'm talking about I've been talking this way for sixteen years and now, out of the blue, it's vulgar!
You gotta get another tour. We're gettin' too old for this.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm not saying it's your fault.
What did you do tonight?
I watched TV.
I watched TV.
What did you watch?
What did you watch?
I don't remember Michael, go to sleep. You don't have to make conversation with me.
Hey, we qualify for the Senior Citizens Early-Bird Special... Did you see Tommy today? He misses you...
Well. This'll be over soon. Venza's such a nut job, we're bound to pick him up soon.
Well. This'll be over soon. Venza's such a nut job, we're bound to pick him up soon.
I'd like you to switch to the day shift, Mike. To be home for dinner. Helen insists that T.J. be home for dinner... That's why he's on the morning shift.
I'd like you to switch to the day shift, Mike. To be home for dinner. Helen insists that T.J. be home for dinner... That's why he's on the morning shift.

I already did. I mean, I talked to his wife, and she talked to him...
I already did. I mean, I talked to his wife, and she talked to him...
You talked to his wife?
My wife talks to his wife about what shift I'm gonna take?
What's the difference?
Let me drive...
Get away from me... get away! She means that much to you, you stay with her. But you come back, you come back for me. Not for Tommy, not for your mother, or your fucking job, but for me.
Get away from me... get away! She means that much to you, you stay with her. But you come back, you come back for me. Not for Tommy, not for your mother, or your fucking job, but for me.
El? I'm sorry. I do love you. And you are a lady. I have so much respect...
I'm going to visit my sister for a few days. I'd like you to get your stuff out.
What about Tommy?
What about Tommy?
He'll live through it. They all live through it. What a world, huh?
Was it Venza? Did you get him?
No.
Ellie...
I'm all right.
He doesn't want to sleep here. Neither do I. It's not my house anymore.
Me neither.
I don't know how you did it, but whatever it was, keep doing it.
I just sat and listened.
I just sat and listened.
Safe and secure is how we want her. Until she I.D.'s Venza.
Why not Patrol? They'd do just as good a job.
When I want your advise, Keegan, I'll make an appointment.
What about when she goes out?
Discourage it. But stay with her if you can't. Call it in first so we can have a car on tail. She's agreed to travel only with her own driver and limousine... okay, let's check it out.
But I got him! He's in jail! Wasn't that the point...?!
You apprehended him after he gave himself up --

It wasn't a bad bust. He gave himself up because he knew I was gonna nab him.

Even Joey Venza?!
Even Joey Venza?!
He's got a good lawyer, and he made a smart move. We've got a scared witness and a suspect who proved "good will" by turning himself in.

What about when she identifies him?!
What about when she identifies him?!
If she identifies him. Where the fuck were you anyway, cowboy! Venza was meat. He walked right past you, and now we're the ones playing catch-up! You better hope she identifies him.
They're operating on him. He's still alive.
I heard.
I heard a lot... Anything you want to deny, Mike?
It should've been me...
What do you think? Any chance? There's nothin' else I'm any good at, but this.
Call me next week. We'll talk about it.
At my house...!
Call a cruiser!
Let's go. We're takin' her home! Move it! Get the cars!
Koontz! I need you guys!
Koontz! I need you guys!
We'll call SWAT. We'll get the locals. Throw it!
We'll call SWAT. We'll get the locals. Throw it!
No, I need'm now!
No One-Seventeen, they'll fuck it up! He told me not to tell anybody, to bring Claire and come alone! He won't wait, he knows I'm two minutes away! Koontz, please!
I can't do it, you know that... He's not gonna allow it anyway, Mike. No way is he gonna let anybody walk out of that house alive, who can finger him.
Hey Mike, out of the bag into the bureau, huh... How do you like it so far?
Right behind you, T.J.
Who's Joey Venza?
Bad fuckin' news. Even the families dropped him when they found they had a fruitcake on their hands. But he knows where a lot of bodies are buried. It'd cap it for Garber if he could bring him in.
Shit! A Nursemaid! My first detail, and I'm a fuckin' slug! I got a 'choice' at all.
Do it, or look for another profession. That's a choice I guess.
Do it, or look for another profession. That's a choice I guess.
You in this with me?
You in this with me?
Yeah! Seniority gets the day shift.
Not Koontz.
Be happy. He's good at this.
Wasn't your fault.
It was my fault, T.J. Fuck!
Tell me I'm dreamin'.
I just gotta talk to her, T.J.
Uh, yeah. I'm a policeman.
Ever shot anyone?
Ever shot anyone?
Yes.
Yes.
Does it make you... hard?
Does it make you... hard?
... Hard?

Erect. You know, a "boner?" I'd heard that it gives you a boner, to shoot a man.
Are you in charge here?
No, sir...
No, sir...
I asked for the man in charge...
I asked for the man in charge...
That would be Lieutenant Garber, and he's very busy upstairs...

Don't tell me he's "busy". I asked for an ambulance for this woman and...
Don't tell me he's "busy". I asked for an ambulance for this woman and...
Is she injured?
You're not going to talk to anyone without a lawyer.
She's not a suspect, sir, she's a witness. Could I ask you to step outside, please.
She's not a suspect, sir, she's a witness. Could I ask you to step outside, please.
No, I will not step outside.
No, I will not step outside.
Sir, I am just trying to do my job, it's standard procedure to question the witness alone. Help me out here, could you please leave.
Sir, I am just trying to do my job, it's standard procedure to question the witness alone. Help me out here, could you please leave.
I don't really see what that has to do with...
You're here 'til what time?
I'm relieved at 4:00 A.M.
You made a terrible mistake, Keegan. You didn't do what I said.
That's right, you're gonna do what I say. Joey. I want to help you out of this.
That's right, you're gonna do what I say. Joey. I want to help you out of this.
You should'a brought the girl.

Why should she come in?

She trusts me. She'll do what I say.
She trusts me. She'll do what I say.
Bullshit! Prove it.
Bullshit! Prove it.
Koontz! Let her come in! Claire! It's pitch dark in here! You're gonna have trouble seeing anything, so just come in, and straight down a long hall. Then stand at the door so we can see you. We want to see your face and we won't be able to until you get to the kitchen door!
I want your guarantee they'll be turned loose when she opens the front door.
I get my hostage first. No one's turned loose until I say so.

Screw scholarships! Universities are death! They make slaves of us all with their fetid ideas! Burn 'em down, I say!
Great idea. Let me get some shoes. I'll take you home.
Why home? The real world beckons, man! The possibilities are endless. Want to go up to the World Trade Center and laugh at New Jersey?
You're so responsible it's disgusting. But you're my only friend... do you hate me?
Don't be pitiful.

He left. I couldn't believe it-- he just left! It's as if he's somewhere else... I'm only getting a piece of him.

Eat alone, gotta read. Social defense tactic 17 Peter, that jacket is foul. Lose your glasses?
Hi, Adele.
Brrr. It's colder than New Hampshire in here.
I'm sure you kept warm.
Don't misquote Othello at me. Besides, you'd have to care about somebody to strangle them.

Do you mind if I come too?

I think I'd like that.
They keep saying there's nothing I could've done. That's a lie. I could've done something. If only I'd paid attention to my feelings.

Hello. Earth to Peter. Are you listening?
Unh-huh. Excuse me. I've gotta go.
I'm sorry about being a jerk this afternoon.
Just shut up and close your eyes. This'll hurt.
May's much better. She'll be out soon.

Hold it. Can we stop being clever, just for a moment?
Why?
This may be the end of a beautiful friendship, you know.
Nah.
You were the last one to see Thorkel. In Octavius' hospital room.
So you've found Thorkel?
So you've found Thorkel?
Some of him char-broiled bones. Teeth. We ruled out suicide. Any bad blood between him and Ock?
Octavius wasn't the murderer type.
But you said he went off a little, after the accident, when those mechanical arms--
But you said he went off a little, after the accident, when those mechanical arms--
Waldos.
Waldos.
Right. We have reason to believe he also robbed an armored truck and killed two men. With the waldos.
Lieutenant, I've triangulated recent bizarre events-- the Bronx, Jersey, Brooklyn-- all rippling out from-- Here. The E.S.U. Science Center. Octavius' experiment seems to have opened a hole in space-time, drastically changing the interrelation between molecular binding, electromagnetism and gravity--
Yeah, that's fascinating, but I'm just a fat, dumb cop lookin' for a psycho killer--
Yeah, that's fascinating, but I'm just a fat, dumb cop lookin' for a psycho killer--
There's an infinitely greater danger. If-- Listen. The only thing Octavius cares about is repeating his experiment. To do that, he needs a radioactive catalyst, SL 270.
Toxic dumps, huh.
And he'll need a cyclotron. He can't use ours-- he's already destroyed it. Guard every nuclear accelerator on the Eastern Seaboard. New Haven, Long Island, two in Cambridge--

Any sign of our friend?

Nope. Maybe he skipped to Rio. Feds got troops surrounding every cyclotron on the continent. Are you absolutely positive that one at E.S.U. is kaput?
Roz? Rosomoff? What is it?
Precise equipment such as waldos
There's nothing in there worth stealing!
That's the understatement of the year.
Aunt May, you're trespassing.
Your records are older than you are. Have you never heard of new wave?
When I moved out, you swore up and down you wouldn't meddle--
Oh, Peter. A zit.
I am old enough to--

No.

It'll shut itself off.

I've had an extremely bad day, Octavius. A sophomoric prank in the library and punitive measures.
Then the alumni reports came in-- fund-raising is down this year.
I couldn't care less. What I've done is--
What you've done is make the entire physics department look foolish. You compare yourself to Einstein; your colleagues compare you to Bozo the Clown.
This is the unified field! All the forces of the universe tied together-- perfectly!
You've used up your grant. The electric bills alone exceed your annual salary. Not to mention the potential hazards of your radioactive fuel.
I don't care. Cretin.
That Nobel Prize will just have to wait.
No!
Then you'll be glad to know the University has decided not to press criminal charges against you. Breaking and entering the minor matter of the total destruction of a 23 million dollar cyclotron

Perhaps. But every now and then someone pays attention. You did.
No. No thank you. I have work.
I heard about Thorkel's order--
I heard about Thorkel's order--
I left a paper in my desk.
A bit melodramatic but if you could prove it that would tie in your unified field theory, the Big Bang, Kaluza-Klein--
Ach, theories! This was first hand, experiential knowledge, the essence of the universe.
My self. I don't matter. This human life, all life- insignificant. Bodies-- bags of sleepy, sluggish flesh.
All right, we may be insignificant, imperfect creatures-- but we're all we've got.
All right, we may be insignificant, imperfect creatures-- but we're all we've got.
You're wrong. Just for a moment, I heard, saw, felt-- I became Creation.
Creation? Or its opposite?
Truth. Pure, eternal. Beyond the boundaries of mere mortality.
Otto, we are mere mortals. You must never forget your own limits--
I'll repeat the experiment. I will hold the truth. That's the only thing that matters.
I'll repeat the experiment. I will hold the truth. That's the only thing that matters.
No. It isn't.
Life and death matter. Yours-- everyone's. By comparison, our search for truth is only a product of curiosity, a game--
Oh, Roz. My mind is so far beyond yours now. I could beat you at chess now.
My God, Otto, you have to hear me! The world we know will collapse! Everything we have devoted our lives to-- all patterns, all harmonies-- will be destroyed!
Truth. Truth alone exists. Truth must be released...
Truth. Truth alone exists. Truth must be released...

Sure, in the war. Pull those cables--
Up here, Docky Ocky!
No, no! Not there!
Don't let him kid you. Cagney couldn't have pulled a sweeter job. All right, boys. We were waiting in the depot in Frankfurt, see? And there was an ammunition train coming through, the longest ammunition train you ever saw, see? So Dunbar gets himself in the men's room, see? Fixes himself a time bomb, busts open the window and just as the train moves
I wouldn't talk about things like that.

We made a deal with Barrack One.
Any news on Dunbar?
Any news on Dunbar?
He's still in the Kommandant's office. That's all I know.
Do Cagney. Like you did yesterday.
There was that ammunition train in the depot at Frankfurt, see? So Dunbar gets himself in the men's room and fixes a time bomb, see? Then he waits until the train starts moving out, see? And one of the cars got the door open with some straw on the floor, see? So he throws it, see, and three minutes later -- voom! See?

Don't worry. He'll be all right.
Don't worry. He'll be all right.

Come on!

Okay. Move on.

Get going on the trap door.
W-w-will that do or do you want some m-m-m --?
That'll do.
There's only one pair left.
We'll get some more.
What's the matter? You on their team now? You think I'm the guy?
I don't know anymore.
I understand how you feel, Cookie. It's sort of rough -- one American squealing on other Americans. Then again, Cookie -- maybe that stoolie's not an American at all. Maybe he's a German the Krauts planted in this barracks. They do this type of thing. Just put an agent in with us -- a trained specialist. Lots of loose information floating around a prison
In this barracks?
In this barracks?
Why not? Just one of the boys. Sharing our bunks. Eating our chow. Right in amongst the ones that beat me up. Except that he beat hardest.

Who is it?
That's not the point, Cookie. The point is what do you do with him? You tip your mitt and the Jerries pull him out of here and plant him someplace else, like Stalag Sixteen or Fifteen. Or you kill him off and the Krauts turn around and kill off the whole barracks. Every one of us. So what do you do?

If you don't want to tell me, why don't you tell Hoffy? Or Security?
Yeah. Security.
So long, Cookie. The department store is all yours. What's left of it.
So long, Sefton.
Now what kind of a crack is that?
No crack. Two packs of cigarettes say they don't get out of the forest.
Hold it, Sefton. So we heard some shots -- so who says they didn't get away?
Anybody here wanna double their bet?
Private property, bub.
How come the Krauts knew about that stove, Security? And the tunnel? How come you can't lay down a belch around here without them knowing it?
Come on, Trader Horn! Let's hear it: what'd you give the Krauts for that egg?
Forty-five cigarettes. The price has gone up.
Nice guy! The Krauts shoot Manfredi and Johnson last night and today he's out trading with them.
Look, this may be my last hot breakfast on account of they're going to take away that stove. So will you let me eat it in peace?
What's your beef, boys? So I'm trading. Everybody here is trading. Only maybe I trade a little sharper. So that makes me a collaborator.
A lot sharper, Sefton! I'd like to have some of that loot you got in those footlockers!
A lot sharper, Sefton! I'd like to have some of that loot you got in those footlockers!
You would, would you? Listen, Stupe -- the first week I was in this joint somebody stole my Red Cross package, my blanket and my left shoe. Well, I wised up since. This ain't no Salvation Army -- this is everybody for himself. Dog eat dog.

You stink, Sefton!
Static is right! The radio's static, Patton's static, we're static!
Maybe it's going to be a longer war than you figured -- eh, Duke?
I suppose they also know about your distillery and the horseraces?
That's right.
That's right.
Just what makes you and them Krauts so buddy-buddy?
Just what makes you and them Krauts so buddy-buddy?
Ask Security. You tell him, Price. You've got me shadowed every minute of the day. Or haven't you found out yet?
I grease the Kraut guards. With ten percent of the take.
And maybe a little something else?
And maybe a little something else?
A little something what?
Yeah, what about it? Cut the horsing around. We know he's the stoolie and we know what the pay- off is. Let's get on with it.
Let's get on with what? What is this anyway? A Kangaroo Court? Why don't you get a rope and do it right?
Let's get on with what? What is this anyway? A Kangaroo Court? Why don't you get a rope and do it right?
You make my mouth water.
You make my mouth water.
You're all wire happy, boys. You've been in this camp too long. You put two and two together and it comes out four. Only it ain't four.
What are you looking at him for? Any objections, Sefton?
Take it.
Next we're going to auction off your department store -- and your stable.
Why not?
Have a cigar.
Thanks.
I wouldn't worry about Schulz. I'd worry about Sefton. Remember me? I'm the stoolie.
You ain't going to squeal this one, brother.
You ain't going to squeal this one, brother.
No? Aren't you a little afraid to turn the stoolie loose on that compound? For a tip-off like this, you know what the Krauts would pay?
Here's the knife to do it with. Only make sure you got the right throat.
We're looking at it.
Brother, were we all wet about you!
Forget it.
Put me down for ten, you louse.
I'll call the whole pot.
Don't ask me. Price was elected Security.
Okay, Security -- what happened?
Come again?
You betcha. I said one of us is a stoolie. A dirty, stinkin' stoolie!
Break it off!
How much more do we have to take from him?
How much more do we have to take from him?
There'll be no vigilante stuff. Not while I'm Barrack Chief.
How did he get over there?
Easy! Walked right through the gate, past the guard. Like he was some Kraut Field Marshal.
The S.S. Men are here to pick up Dunbar. They're taking him to Berlin. Looks like he's finished.
Only he ain't quite finished yet. Blondie -- get that smudge pot. Tie it to Steve's leg.
Then we're all in on it?
Everybody but Joey, and you know who.
You killed them, huh? Both of them?
Such nice boys! It makes me sick to --
Such nice boys! It makes me sick to --
Don't wear it out!
Cut out the guff, Schulz. We're on to you. You know everything that's happening in this barrack. Who's tipping you off?
Tipping me off? I do not understand.
Come on, Schulz! Spill it! How did you get the information? About Manfredi and Johnson? About the stove and the tunnel? Who's giving it to you? Which one of us is it?
Which one of you is what?
That's the general idea. Only it's not so general as far as I'm concerned.
You are talking crazy!
Lieutenant Dunbar? It wouldn't be James Schuyler Dunbar? From Boston?
Yes, it would. Do we know each other?
Maybe he would. We applied for Officers' Training together, remember? They turned me down, but I'm glad to see you made it. Of course, it couldn't be that all that dough behind you had something to do with it! His mother's got twenty million dollars.
Twenty-five.
Twenty-five.
They've got a summer house in Nantucket, with an upstairs polo field. You better put a canopy over his bunk.
What did you expect, glamor boy? The Officers' Club with a steam room and a massage maybe?
Just a minute. You made a couple of cracks before and I let them slide. But I don't intend to take any more. If you resent my having money, start a revolution, but get off my back.
Just a minute. You made a couple of cracks before and I let them slide. But I don't intend to take any more. If you resent my having money, start a revolution, but get off my back.
Look, Lieutenant. All your dough won't help you here. Because here you're on your own. And no mother to throw you a lifebelt. Now let's see how good you can swim.
Shut off the moaning, or we'll have the dogs on us. Shut it off, Lieutenant. This is orders!
My legs are frozen.
My legs are frozen.
You'd better get that blue blood circulating, because we're busting out of this stink-hole in exactly -- -- one minute and twenty seconds.

What did you expect, a St. Bernard dog?

Not you.

What some brandy?

Yeah.
Yeah.
Who doesn't! Suppose we wait until we hit the Waldorf Astoria.

You won't get off that cheap.

What are the chances busting out of here?
What are the chances busting out of here?
We'll know in forty seconds. Only in a democracy can a poor guy get his keister shot off with a rich guy.
Let's blow, Chauncey.
Let's!
I am Lieutenant Dunbar.
What is your number?
What is your number?
105-353.
105-353.
That is correct. Lieutenant Dunbar, I came to apologize for the accommodations. Ordinarily, of course, we never put officers up with enlisted men.

I'll live.
I'll live.
Quite a transportation jam we are having outside of Frankfurt! They are very angry in Berlin. They will be even angrier on the East Front, waiting for that ammunition train. Don't you think so, Lieutenant?

I don't know what you're talking about, Colonel.

Of course you don't. Now, Lieutenant, how would you like to join me in my quarters? I have a nice fire going.
Of course you don't. Now, Lieutenant, how would you like to join me in my quarters? I have a nice fire going.
I'm okay here. Why bother?

No bother. I'm very grateful for a little company. You see, I suffer from insomnia.

Ever try forty sleeping pills?

Abfuehren!
You have no idea how boring my life here is. If it weren't for an occasional air raid or some foolish prisoners trying to escape, I wouldn't know what to do. I want to thank you for keeping me company. I don't drink, I don't smoke, I don't read. I hate music. That only leaves good conversation. It will be a shame to lose
I didn't do it -- I didn't do it.
I didn't do it -- I didn't do it.
Of course you did! Twenty-six carloads of munitions gone off like a trick cigar! The S.S. is running around in circles. The Gestapo is arresting the wrong people. And von Scherbach has caught the fish. Most amusing, isn't it?
You are being rude again.
I want to sleep. Give me five minutes on that couch.
I want to sleep. Give me five minutes on that couch.
Nine-thirty. General von Pfeffinger should be at his desk by now. Shall we call Berlin and tell him the good news?
Nine-thirty. General von Pfeffinger should be at his desk by now. Shall we call Berlin and tell him the good news?
I didn't do it. I didn't do it.
There will be two S.S. men here tomorrow to take you to Berlin. You will be interrogated by the General Staff. When you come to the part about your arrest, I'm sure you won't forget to give me the proper credit.
I want to sleep... I haven't slept for three days.
I want to sleep... I haven't slept for three days.
You will remember the name? Von Scherbach? VON SCHER-BACH!
I didn't do it. I was in the Frankfurt station and the train was three miles away when it blew up.
Oh, come now! You threw a time bomb.
Oh, come now! You threw a time bomb.
How could I have had a time bomb? They searched me when they took me prisoner.
Here we have a typical barrack. It houses seventy-five men. Every one of them has his own bunk, naturally.
Naturally. It would be rather awkward to have three men in one bunk.

As for the blankets, you will notice they are very warm. Fifty percent wool.
As for the blankets, you will notice they are very warm. Fifty percent wool.
They also smell of moth balls. When were they issued? This morning?
What do you do for heat in this barrack? No stove?
The men here used it for a trap door, so we had to remove it temporarily.

How long is temporarily? I trust not until July.
Well, Herr Inspector! How did you find the camp? Crowded but gemuetlich, shall we say?
I want to talk about Lieutenant Dunbar. Is this Lieutenant Dunbar?

It is.
It is.
What exactly is he charged with?
What exactly is he charged with?
Whatever it is, it's out of your jurisdiction. This man is not a prisoner of war. Not any more. He is a saboteur.
Whatever it is, it's out of your jurisdiction. This man is not a prisoner of war. Not any more. He is a saboteur.
He is a prisoner of war until you can prove sabotage.
And the way you search your prisoners, it does sound rather unlikely.
All I know is he did it. I am satisfied.
All I know is he did it. I am satisfied.
I am not. According to the Geneva Convention --
You were saying --?
Simply this. After the hostilities are ended, there will be such a thing as a War Crimes Commission. If this man should be convicted without proper proof, you will be held responsible, Colonel von Scherbach.

Interesting.
Interesting.
Isn't it?
Very well. If you insist on details. I have ways of finding out about that blasted time bomb. Good day, sir. You will forgive me for receiving you like this?
Perfectly all right. I do not like boots.
Aufstehen, gentlemen! Please! You do not want to stay in bed on such a beautiful morning we are having today!

You should live so long.
Hey, Schulz! I got a deal for you. Suppose you help us escape. We'll go home and have everything ready for you in Madison Square Garden. For the world championship! Schulz, the Beast of Bavaria versus Halitosis Jones!
Droppen Sie dead! Raus mit dem Ofen. Los! Los!
Why don't we accept, Animal? The worst that can happen is we wind up a couple of lamp shades.
Raus! Raus! All of you!
What is this? This is water?
It's a mouse trap.
It's a mouse trap.
And this?
When you get going on those broads, think of me!
Animal! Animal! Aren't you ashamed of yourself? A couple of guys are trying to escape and you're thinking of broads. Broads?
Shut up, Animal!
Maybe they were layin' for 'em out there!
Good morning, Animal! What'll it be for breakfast? Scrambled eggs with little sausages? Bacon and eggs sunny- side up? Griddle cakes? A waffle?
Stop it, Harry!

Coffee? Milk? Or how about a little cocoa?

Why do you do this to me every morning?

Hamburger and onions! Strawberry shortcake! Gefillte fish! Banana split! French fried potatoes! Chicken a la king!
I'll kill you, Harry -- so help me!
Let go, Animal! It's roll call! Hitler wants to see you!

No, Animal.
No?
No?
No. Your eyeball goes. The top of your head. Gotta wind up with athlete's stomach.
Easy, Animal! Easy!
Where'd that come from?
Don't you remember, Animal? A chicken lays those things.
It's beautiful! You goin' to eat it all yourself?
Thanks. You're a real pal! What're we goin' to do with it?
Plant it, Animal, and grow us a chicken for Christmas.
Ain't that too bad! Tomorrow he'll have to suck a raw egg!
He don't have to worry. He'll trade the Krauts for a six-burner gas range. Maybe a deep freeze too.
Wunderbar! Isn't he wunderbar!
He's the grrrrreatest!
Equipoise! Equipoise! What did I tell you, Animal?
Come on, baby! Daddy's going to buy you a hunk of cheese!

That's what I wanna hear.

It's not good for you, Animal.
Hey! This is with a typewriter! It's from a finance company!
So it is from the finance company. So it's better than no letter at all. So they want the third payment on the Plymouth. So they want the fourth, the fifth, the sixth and the seventh. So they want the Plymouth.

That Schulz pig. I'll get him yet.
You hold him. I'll slug him.
Why don't we just look in those footlockers?
Come on, you little stooge. Hand over them keys.
Grable, not Gable!
Do Jimmy Durante!
Do Grable.
Hey, here's Esther Williams.
There, Joey -- ain't that better than being a lawyer?
Animal! Got a little something for you!
I'll open mine now.
I'll open mine, too.
Come on, Animal -- let's trip the light fantastic!
Let me alone.
Let me alone.
You're crying, Animal.

May I have this dance, Miss?
Why, sure!
But it's not just those legs. It's that nose of yours I'm crazy about. That cute little button of a nose!
Hey, Animal! Animal!
Hey, Animal! Animal!
I've been crazy about you for years. I've seen every picture you've ever made six times. I'd just sit there and never even open that popcorn bag.

You want to go?

No. I want to draw.

Yes. According to the Geneva Convention, dead prisoners are to be given a decent burial.
Yes. According to the Geneva Convention, dead prisoners are to be given a decent burial.
Of course. I'm aware of the Geneva Convention. They will be given the burial they deserve. Or perhaps you would suggest we haul in twenty-one cannons from the Eastern Front and give them a twenty-one gun salute?
Good evening, Sergeants. A bit dank in here, isn't it?... Where is the Baracken-Fuehrer?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
You have a Lieutenant here...
...a Lieutenant James Dunbar?
Yes, sir.
Wait a minute. We have some rights here. Why is this man being taken out?
Curtains would do wonders for this barrack. You will not get them.
Look -- if you don't like the way I'm handling this job --
Kill it, Duke. It's got us all spinning.
Don't worry. We'll take care of it.
Take some men and get the antenna going. Let's see if we can catch the BBC.
You're wasting your time, Duke. Outside, everybody! Let's get it over with.
Wait a second, Hoffy. Schulz says he's our best friend. Maybe he can give us a little hint.
Not yet.
Answer the question. How do you rate all those privileges?
Cut the horseplay, Harry. What's the matter with you guys?
And don't blame me if you all wind up in the cooler.
It's not Schulz. It's that stoolie. Whoever he is, he's sure batting a thousand.
The guy I want to talk to is Sefton. Where's Sefton? You haven't seen Sefton, have you?
What are you going to do?
I want everybody out of here. We'll need a lot of commotion on the compound.
I don't know what your scheme is, but it sounds crazy.
Maybe it's crazy, but it's better than having Dunbar dead.
Maybe it's crazy, but it's better than having Dunbar dead.
Just as you say, Hoffy. But wouldn't it be smarter if I went out and kept Schulz tied up?
Just as you say, Hoffy. But wouldn't it be smarter if I went out and kept Schulz tied up?
Good.
What about Schulz?
We'll take care of Schulz. Come on.
No volunteers, Price. I said we're all in on it.
You have elected me Security. The way things have been going in this Barracks, I guess I've done a poor job and I want to make up for it. Is that asking too much?
We've all done a poor job of it.
I still say this is my tag. Any objections, Hoffy?
I still say this is my tag. Any objections, Hoffy?
Any objections, men?
What do you say, Hoffy. We'll hit the air raid trenches and cut out in back of Barracks nine.
You'd better cut out in back of the south latrine.
You'd better cut out in back of the south latrine.
Why the south latrine?
Why the south latrine?
Because that's where he is. In the water tank.
Los, los. Dummkopf!
Lay off, Schulz. He's got a sickness. He's krank.

Yeah? How would you like to see the guts of nine pals splattered all over your plane? C'mon Joey -- don't be afraid.
We know! We got them last year. Five minutes after the Geneva Man was gone, the blankets were gone.
One more thing, gentlemen. The Kommandant told me to pick up the radio.
One more thing, gentlemen. The Kommandant told me to pick up the radio.
What radio?
What radio?
The one you are hiding in the barrack, don't you know? The one your friend without the leg is smuggling all over the compound.
You must get out. For your own good, you must get out.
Come on, everybody! Let's go!
Stay out of it, Sefton.
Just one question. Did you calculate the risk?
Anybody call?
Go on, Sefton -- butt out!
If I were you, Sefton, I'd eat that egg some place else. Like for instance under the barrack.
A little weak today.
If you can't get the BBC, how about getting Guy Lombardo?
Are we boring you?
What's the big idea, Sefton? Take that telescope out of here.
Says who?
Says who?
Says me.
Says me.
You take it out. Only you're going to have a riot on your hands.
You take it out. Only you're going to have a riot on your hands.
Every time the men get Red Cross packages you have to think up an angle to rob them.
Lay off, Sefton.
With your mother's pull, how come you're not a chicken colonel by now?
With your mother's pull, how come you're not a chicken colonel by now?
Lay off, I said -- if you don't want your head handed to you.
What's the matter, boys? Is my slip showing?
I'll say it is. You spilled a little borscht on it.
I'll say it is. You spilled a little borscht on it.
Borscht?
What happened, Cookie? Who did it?
We did it.
We did it.
There better not be anything missing. This is private property.
What's it add up to you, Sefton?
It adds up that you got yourselves the wrong guy. Because I'm telling you. The Krauts wouldn't plant two stoolies in one barrack. And whatever you do to me you're going to have to do all over again when you find the right guy.
You heard that, Sefton?
Sure I heard it. I still got one good ear.
You'll stay in this barracks and not a peep out of you.
Okay, then. Put a guard on me. I want you to put a guard on me. Because if anything goes wrong out there, this time you won't have a patsy. Right?
Okay, then. Put a guard on me. I want you to put a guard on me. Because if anything goes wrong out there, this time you won't have a patsy. Right?

Right.
So who stays with me? Maybe Joey? No -- not Joey. Wouldn't you feel safer with Security on the job?
So who stays with me? Maybe Joey? No -- not Joey. Wouldn't you feel safer with Security on the job?
Okay, Price. You stay.
Two packs of cigarettes say Dunbar never gets out of the compound.
You starting that again?
You starting that again?
Anybody cover?
Hurry up on that trap. What are you trying to do, Sefton? Gum up the works?
That's right. Or would you rather see Dunbar lying out there in the mud tomorrow morning like Manfredi and Johnson?
That's right. Or would you rather see Dunbar lying out there in the mud tomorrow morning like Manfredi and Johnson?

Uh-huh. Fell right on my head. Sprechen sie deutsch?
Go on.
He's a Nazi, Price is. For all I know, his name is Preismaier or Preissinger. Sure, he lived in Cleveland, but when the war broke out he came back to the Fatherland like a good little Bundist. He spoke our lingo so they put him through spy school, gave him phony dogtags --
What are we going to do with him?
Don't you know? Because I got my own ideas. Let's have that civilian stuff.
You taking Dunbar?
You betcha. There ought to be some reward money from Mama. Say ten thousand bucks worth.
I told you boys I'm no escape artist, but for the first time, I like the odds. Because now I got me a decoy.
What's the decoy?
What's the decoy?
Price. When I go I want you to give me five minutes. Exactly five minutes to get Dunbar out of that water tank. Then you throw Price out into the compound, nice and loud. He'll draw every light from every goon tower. It's our only chance to cut through. What do you say, Barracks' Chief?

Shoot!
You could use a new one yourself.
Let's synchronize the watches. Eleven forty-two, sharp.

At ease! He also says, quote: All you sack rats better show up for the services and no bull from anybody. Unquote. At ease! Monday afternoon a sailboat race will be held at the cesspool.

Just what makes you so popular?
Yeah?
Give this to Joey, will you?
Give this to Joey, will you?
Oh.
Now you've done it. You've given me nervous indigestion. Anything else bothering you, boys?
Just one little thing. How come you were so sure Manfredi and Johnson wouldn't get out of the forest?
Just one little thing. How come you were so sure Manfredi and Johnson wouldn't get out of the forest?
I wasn't so sure. I just liked the odds.
And what's that crack supposed to mean?
They're lying dead in the mud out there and I'm trying to find out how come.
They're lying dead in the mud out there and I'm trying to find out how come.
I'll tell you how come. The Barrack Chief gave them the green light. And you, our Security Officer, said it'd be safe. That's how come.
When the Krauts find that gadget they'll throw us all in the boob.
They know about that gadget. I'd worry more about the radio.
So was the radio private property. So was Manfredi and Johnson.
What about the radio?
Or how about a game of pinochle? No, you're not a pinochle man. You're a chess player. I haven't played since I was a kid. Let's see -- -- a pawn moves this way, doesn't it? And a bishop this way? And the queen -- every which way, doesn't it?

Don't bother, Sefton. I don't like you. I never did and I never will.
Don't bother, Sefton. I don't like you. I never did and I never will.
A lot of people say that and the first thing you know is they get married and live happily ever after. I wonder what they're trying to pull out there?
Ach so!
What did you say?
What did you say?
Amazing, what you can do with five thousand ping-pong balls, isn't it?
Stop that, will you! Those idiots! So they sprang Dunbar! So what good is it? He's still in the compound, isn't he? How long can he last? Where can they hide him?
Where. Up Joey's ocarina. Didn't you know?
Are we going to stand around here and listen to him until the Germans find out where Dunbar is?
The Germans know where Dunbar is.
No. I don't sprechen sie deutsch.
Maybe just one word? Kaput? Because you're kaput, Price.

What time?
What time?
Six o'clock. I was having dinner.
Six o'clock. I was having dinner.
Six o'clock in Berlin. They were having lunch in Cleveland. Am I boring you, boys?
The what?
The one you took out of the corner of your bunk and put in this pocket.
Say, Schulz -- you guys had machine gun practice last night?
Ach, terrible! Such foolish boys. Such nice boys. I'd better not talk about it. It makes me sick to my stomach.
Let us see. We have now two empty bunks here. Nummer einundsiebzig und Nummer dreiundsiebzig in Baracke vier.
Suppose you let those mattresses cool off a little -- just out of decency?
Suppose you let those mattresses cool off a little -- just out of decency?
Ja, ja, gewiss! It is only that we are cramped for space with new prisoners every day. Gentlemen! Outside! Please! Do you want me to have trouble with the Kommandant again!
Which one of us is the informer?
You are trying to say that an American would inform on other Americans?
Schulz, you're off your nut!
Give me the radio.
Give me the radio.
We have no radio.
We have no radio.
All right, gentlemen, I will find it myself. Now let's see.
Nun? Was ist? Haben Sie's herausgefunden?
Ich weiss alles.
Ich weiss alles.
Wie hat er's gemacht?
Wie hat er's gemacht?
Ganz einfach... Streichhoelzer... und eine Zigarette...
Good morning, Sefton.
Good morning, Schulz. And how's Mrs. Schulz? And all the little Schulzes?
Good morning, Schulz. And how's Mrs. Schulz? And all the little Schulzes?
Fine -- fine!
No use, Schulz. You might as well come clean. Why don't you just tell 'em it's me. Because I'm really the illegitimate son of Hitler. And after the Germans win the war you'll make me the Gauleiter of Zinzinnati.
You Americans! You are the craziest people! That's why I like you! I wish I could invite you all to my house for a nice German Christmas!
Du lieber Gott! How do you look? You had a fight?
How would you like to give Frau Schulz a pair of silk stockings for Christmas?

Here. Take them.
Wunderbar! Maybe they are too wunderbar for my wife. But there is a piano teacher in the village --
And how about three hundred cigarettes for yourself?
Three hundred cigarettes! What is it you want from me?
Who's the guy, Schulz?
Who's the guy, Schulz?
What guy?
What guy?
The one you work with. Who is he? How do you do it?
The one you work with. Who is he? How do you do it?
I do not want those cigarettes.
I do not want those cigarettes.
Yes, you do!
I'll make it five hundred!
No! No!
You'd better talk, Schulz, because I'm going to find out with you or without you. Because I won't let go for a second. Because they'll have to kill me to stop me. So talk!
Talk what? I do not know anything!
Talk what? I do not know anything!
How many do you want? A thousand?
What's the matter with you? You want to be killed?
Not particularly.
Hey, Schulz -- as long as you're going to move somebody in -- how about a couple of those Russian broads?
Russian women prisoners?
Just get us a couple with big Glockenspiels.
Ja! Ja! Droppen Sie dead!
Did I interrupt something, gentlemen?
Yeah. We were just passing out guns.
Yeah. We were just passing out guns.
Always joking. Always making wisecrackers!
This is me in Cincinnati.
Who's the other wrestler? The one with the mustache?
Who's the other wrestler? The one with the mustache?
That is my wife.
That is my wife.
Look at all that meat. Isn't she the bitter end!
Look at all that meat. Isn't she the bitter end!
Give it back. You must not arouse yourselves.
All right, gentlemen! We will now all go outside for a little gymnastic and take some shovels and undig the tunnel which you digged.
Why don't we just plug up that tunnel -- with the Kommandant on one end and you on the other.
Why don't we just plug up that tunnel -- with the Kommandant on one end and you on the other.
It is not me. It is the orders. I am your friend. I am your best friend here.
Gentlemen, tomorrow morning the Geneva Man is coming to inspect the camp whether we are living up to the International Convention. I am sure he will find we are treating you very well. You must not run around in your underwear. And take off the wash. The Kommandant wants all the barracks to be spic and also span.
We'll put pink ribbons on the bedbugs.
We'll put pink ribbons on the bedbugs.
The Kommandant also sends you clean blankets. He wants every man to have a new, clean blanket.
My grandmother's ear-muffs.
Look at them, Lieutenant. Everybody is a clown! How do you expect to win the war with an army of clowns?
From a chicken, bug-wit.
A chicken?
Is it all right if we smell it?
Just don't drool on it.
That wouldn't be the cigarettes you took us for last night?
What was I going to do with them? I only smoke cigars.
You must have been some tail gunner! Go ahead, Cookie.
Come on, let's get that mail. Anything for Stanislaus Kuzawa?
Have a nice time over there?
Oh! Somebody was peeking!
So you're stuck with me, eh?
Maybe those Russian dames would take him.
You heard him.
Okay, Herr Preismaier, let's have the mail box.
You're not disposing of those Russian broads?
Tell you what to do. First, get yourself a hundred cigarettes for the Kraut guards. Then get yourself another face.
Toh-pak-cha=8A
HoS qorDu.
The Captain would make a much more valuable hostage.
We'll consider it a prisoner exchange.
It's working.
Where is he?
I thought he was the Chief Engineer.
He is.
He is.
Then when is he going to Engineering?
Where is he now?
I don't know. He bathed, now he is roaming the ship. He must be the only Engineer in Starfleet who does not go to Engineering!
Target their Bridge.
Full disruptors.
Actually, Captain, your precise target area was thirty-five meters that way.
Thanks for pointing that out.
Tomorrow I want to make a tri-elliptical jump. That's where you jump out over Northern China and make three complete orbits before you start re-entry.
Captain. Perhaps you have forgotten that tomorrow is the christening ceremony.
Captain=8A
I don't want to hear anymore about it. I'm not going, and that's final.
But that wasn't so long ago. It couldn't have been more than...
Twelve years, sir.
Twelve years, sir.
Yes, well, congratulations, Ensign. It wouldn't be the Enterprise without a Sulu at the helm.
According to our information, the ribbon is a conflux of temporal energy which travels through our galaxy every 39.1 years
When is it expected back?
Data?
Sorry, Captain. The ribbon has already entered the galaxy. It will pass through this sector in approximately thirty-one hours.
Guinan said Soran was trying to get back to the ribbon. If that's true, then there must be some connection with the Amargosa star.
The star's destruction has had numerous astro-physical effects within this sector. However, none of them appear to have a connection to the energy ribbon.
The star's destruction has had numerous astro-physical effects within this sector. However, none of them appear to have a connection to the energy ribbon.
Give me a list of those effects. I want to know every single thing which has been altered or changed, no matter how insignificant.
Give me a list of those effects. I want to know every single thing which has been altered or changed, no matter how insignificant.
It will take a few moments for the computer to compile the information.
Data, are you all right?
No, sir. I am finding it difficult to concentrate. I believe I am overwhelmed with feelings of remorse and regret concerning my actions on the observatory.
No, sir. I am finding it difficult to concentrate. I believe I am overwhelmed with feelings of remorse and regret concerning my actions on the observatory.
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
I wanted to save Geordi. I tried. But I experienced something I did not expect. I believe it was fear.
Fear is a very difficult emotion to overcome. It's something we all have to learn to deal with.
But I did not deal with it, sir. I let it prevent me from helping my friend. Does that make me a coward?
But I did not deal with it, sir. I let it prevent me from helping my friend. Does that make me a coward?
No. And what you must try to avoid is becoming consumed by another emotion which I believe you're beginning to experience: guilt.
No. And what you must try to avoid is becoming consumed by another emotion which I believe you're beginning to experience: guilt.
Guilt. It is a most unpleasant feeling.
According to our current information, the destruction of the Amargosa star has had the following effects in this sector: gamma emissions have increased by .05 percent, the starship Bozeman was forced to make a course correction, a research project on Gorik IV was halted due to increased neutrino particles, ambient magnetic fields have decreased by-
Wait. The Bozeman,why did it change course?
Wait. The Bozeman,why did it change course?
The destruction of the Amargosa star has altered the gravitational forces throughout the sector. Any ship passing through this region will have to make a minor course correction.
This is its current position.
Can you project its course?
Courage is an emotion too, Data. Now, can you project the course of the ribbon?
I believe so.
Now, you said the gravitational forces in this sector have been altered, could that also affect the course of the ribbon?
I believe so.
He can't go to the ribbon, so he's trying to make the ribbon come to him. Data, is it going to pass near any M-Class planets?
Yes, sir. There are two in the Veridian system.
That's where he's going.
It should be noted, sir, that the collapse of the Veridian star would produce a shock wave similar to the one we observed at Amargosa.
It should be noted, sir, that the collapse of the Veridian star would produce a shock wave similar to the one we observed at Amargosa.
And destroy every planet in the system.
Are any of them inhabited?
Veridian III is uninhabited, but Veridian IV supports a pre-industrial humanoid society.

Approximately two hundred thirty million.
"Lifeforms tiny little lifeforms. Where are the lifeforms-"
Commander.
Commander.
Sorry, sir. There is too much interference in the planet's ionosphere for an accurate reading.
Approximately forty-seven minutes, sir.
I have to find a way to get to Soran.
Is she still angry?
No, but I'd stay out of Sickbay for a while if I were you. I still don't know why you dropped her in the water.
No, but I'd stay out of Sickbay for a while if I were you. I still don't know why you dropped her in the water.
I was attempting to get in the spirit of things. I thought it would be humorous.
Data, you're not thinking about using that thing are you?
It has occurred to me on several occasions. But I believe this may be the appropriate time.
It has occurred to me on several occasions. But I believe this may be the appropriate time.
Wait a minute. I thought you've always been afraid it would overload your neural net.
Wait a minute. I thought you've always been afraid it would overload your neural net.
That is true. However, I believe my growth as an artificial lifeform has reached an impasse. For thirty-four years I have endeavored to become more "human"- to grow beyond my original programming. And yet I am still unable to grasp such a simple concept as humor. This emotion chip is the only answer.
But at the first sign of trouble, I'm going to deactivate it. Agreed?
Agreed.
Well?
I believe the beverage has provoked an emotional response.
I believe the beverage has provoked an emotional response.
Really? What do you feel?
Really? What do you feel?
I am uncertain. I have had little experience with emotions. I am unable to articulate the sensation.
I get it. I get it.
You get what?
What?
During the Farpoint mission. We were on the Bridge and you told a joke. That was the punchline.
During the Farpoint mission. We were on the Bridge and you told a joke. That was the punchline.
The Farpoint mission? Data, that was seven years ago.

I know. I just got it. It was very funny.
I know. I just got it. It was very funny.
Thanks.
I don't see a control panel, or an access port.
It appears to be a magnetically sealed.
Data, this isn't the time.
I am sorry, but I cannot stop myself. I think something is wrong
Data, are you all right?
I believe the emotional chip has overloaded my positronic relays.
I believe the emotional chip has overloaded my positronic relays.
We better get you back to the ship La Forge to Enterprise.
That's it, Bridge- we're all out!
One minute to warp core breach.
Sensors show five life signs aboard the station, Captain.
The station complement was nineteen.
Looks like you're stuck with emotions for a while. How do you feel?
I am quite...preoccupied with concern about Geordi.
I am quite...preoccupied with concern about Geordi.
We all are, Data. But we're going to get him back.
We all are, Data. But we're going to get him back.
I hope so, sir.
Could we access the defective coil and trigger their cloak?
Perhaps. Yes! If we sent a low-level ionic pulse, it might reset the coil and engage the cloaking systems.
I have rerouted auxiliary power to the lateral thrusters- attempting to level our descent.
All hands, brace for impact!
Can you locate them?
The ships are bearing at 3-1-0 mark 2-1-5. Distance: three light years.
The ships are bearing at 3-1-0 mark 2-1-5. Distance: three light years.
Signal the closest starship. We're in no condition to mount a rescue. We don't even have a full crew aboard.
We're within visual range of the energy distortion, Captain.
On screen.
We're within range, sir.
Beam them directly to Sickbay.
Deck 15, section 21-alpha.
I'll go. You have the Bridge.
You did it, Kirk! Damage report, Ensign.
There's some buckling on the starboard nacelle. We've also got a hull breach in the Engineering section. Emergency forcefields are in place and holding.
Do you remember him?
Oh yes. I remember everyone who was on the Lakul, every face. Even the ones who didn't make it.
Guinan. It's important that you tell me what you know. We think Soran's developed a weapon...a terrible weapon. It might give him enough power to-
Soran doesn't care about power or weapons. All he cares about is getting back to the Nexus.
Soran doesn't care about power or weapons. All he cares about is getting back to the Nexus.
What's the "Nexus"?
That ribbon isn't just some random energy phenomenon travelling through space. It's a doorway. It leads to another place- the Nexus. It doesn't exist in our universe and it doesn't play by the same rules either.
What happened to you?
What happened to you?
I can't remember very much - what it looked like or how long I was there. But I do remember how it felt.
It took a long time, but eventually I learned to live with it. And I began to realize that my experience in the Nexus had changed me. I knew things about people, about events, about time.
Your "sixth sense"- I've always wondered where it came from. And what about Soran?
Your "sixth sense"- I've always wondered where it came from. And what about Soran?
Soran may still be obsessed with getting back. And if he is, he'll do anything to find that doorway again.
Soran may still be obsessed with getting back. And if he is, he'll do anything to find that doorway again.
But why destroy a star? Thank you, Guinan.
Guinan, what's going on? Where am I?
You're in the Nexus.
This is the Nexus?
For you. This is where you wanted to be.
For you. This is where you wanted to be.
But I never had a wife, children, a home like this.
But I never had a wife, children, a home like this.
Enjoy them, Jean-Luc.
Guinan, what are you doing here? I thought you were on the Enterprise.
I am on the Enterprise. I am also here. Think of me as an "echo" of the person you know. A part she left behind.
I am on the Enterprise. I am also here. Think of me as an "echo" of the person you know. A part she left behind.
Left behind?
Left behind?
When the Enterprise-B beamed us off the Lakul, we were partially in the Nexus. The transporters locked on to us, but somehow everyone left a part of themselves behind.

Soran?
Soran?
All of us.
All of us.
Where is he now?
Where is he now?
Wherever he wanted to be.
These are my children...my children.
Yeah. They're great, aren't they? You can go back and see them born, go forward and see your grandchildren. Time has no meaning here.
Guinan, can I leave the Nexus?
Why would you want to leave?
Why would you want to leave?
Can I?
Can I?
Yes, where would you go?
Yes, where would you go?
I don't understand.
I don't understand.
I told you, time has no meaning here. If you leave, you can go anywhere, any time.
I know exactly where I want to go, and when. Back to that mountaintop on Veridian III, before Soran put out the star. I have to stop him.
What makes you think things will be any different this time?
What makes you think things will be any different this time?
You're right. I'll need help. Guinan, will you come back with me? Together, we could-
You're right. I'll need help. Guinan, will you come back with me? Together, we could-
I can't leave. I'm already there, remember?
I'm Captain John Harriman. I'd like to welcome you all aboard.
It's our pleasure.
Well, may we have a look around?
Please, please.
Excuse me, gentlemen, if you'll take your seats.
Oh, of course.
Prepare to leave spacedock. Aft thrusters ahead one quarter, port and starboard at station keeping. Captain Kirk, I'd be honored if you would give the order to get underway.
No, no. Thank you.
No, no. Thank you.
Please, I insist.
We don't have a tractor beam.
You left spacedock without a tractor beam?
You left spacedock without a tractor beam?
It won't be installed until Tuesday. Ensign Sulu, try generating a subspace field around the ships. That might break them free.
What about the gravimetric distortions? They'll tear us apart.
Risk is part of the game if you want to sit in that chair.
Beautiful day, isn't it?
Yes, yes, it is.
This clock, I gave this clock to Bones.
I'm from what you would consider the future; the 24th-century.
So you're telling me this is the 24th-century, and I'm dead?
Not exactly. As I said, this is some kind of-
Not exactly. As I said, this is some kind of-
Temporal nexus, yeah, I heard you. Something's missing.
You said history considers me dead. Who am I to argue with history?
You're a Starfleet officer and you have a duty to-
You're a Starfleet officer and you have a duty to-
I don't need to be lectured by you. I was out saving the galaxy when your grandfather was still in diapers. And frankly, I think the galaxy owes me one I was like you once- so worried about duty and obligations that I couldn't see anything past this uniform. And in the end, what did it get me? Nothing. Not this time.
No, no, it's not. It's better.
Better?
Better?
This is my uncle's barn in Iowa.
Antonia?
She's not real either, is she? Nothing here is. Nothing here matters.
Captain of the Enterprise, huh?
That's right.
That's right.
Close to retirement?
Close to retirement?
I hadn't planned on it.
How can I argue with the captain of the Enterprise? What was the name of that planet=8A Veridian III?
That's right.
That's right.
I take it the odds are against us and the situation is grim?
I take it the odds are against us and the situation is grim?
You could say that.
You could say that.
Of course, if Spock were here, he'd say I was being an irrational, illogical human for wanting to go on a mission like that.
I'll find a way to contact the Enterprise. You're going to be all right.
Did we do it? Did we make a difference?
Did we do it? Did we make a difference?
Yes. Thank you.
Yes. Thank you.
Least I could do for a captain of the Enterprise.
Oh
I've warned ye about that back of yours. You should have a doctor take a look at it.
I'm not going Scotty, help me with this chute.
What do you mean, you're not going? We promised.
What do you mean, you're not going? We promised.
When I retired, I swore I'd never set foot on a starship again, and I meant it.
You know, Scotty, it amazes me.
And what would that be, sir?
And what would that be, sir?
Sulu. When did he find the time for a family?
Sulu. When did he find the time for a family?
It's like you always said- if something's important enough, you make the time.
Their life signs are are phasing in and out of our space-time continuum.
Phasing? To where?
The first thing you learn as captain is how to cheat death. Scotty?
There's just no way to disrupt a gravimetric field of this magnitude!
But I do have a theory...
I thought you might.
I thought you might.
An anti-matter discharge directly ahead=8A it might disrupt the field long enough for us to break away.
An anti-matter discharge directly ahead=8A it might disrupt the field long enough for us to break away.
A photon torpedo?
A photon torpedo?
Aye.
Aye.
Load torpedo bays, prepare to fire on my command.
Captain, it may be possible to simulate a torpedo blast using a resonance burst from the main deflector dish.
Where are the deflector relays?
Keep her together until I get back.
I always do.
Kirk here.
Captain, I don't know how much longer I can hold her together!
A remarkable piece of equipment, but a little inelegant, wouldn't you say? Have you ever considered a prosthesis that would make you look a little more...normal?
What's normal?
What's normal?
Normal is what everyone else is, and what you are not.
Normal is what everyone else is, and what you are not.
What do you want?
I don't want a science lecture. You were on that observatory looking for trilithium. Why?
I was ordered to by the Captain.
Let's try to move beyond the usual prisoner-interrogator banter, shall we? You have information and I need it. Did the Captain explain his orders to you? Did he say why you were searching for trilithium?
No.
No.
What about Guinan? What has she told you about me?
What about Guinan? What has she told you about me?
Guinan? I don't know what you're talking about.
Oh, I forgot to tell you. While you were unconscious, I injected a nano-probe into your bloodstream. It's been navigating your cardiovascular system, and right now I've attached it to your left ventricle. A little trick I picked up from the Borg.
Yeah, they're full of great ideas.
Yeah, they're full of great ideas.
I just stopped your heart for five seconds. It felt like an eternity, didn't it? Did you know that you can stop the human heart for up to ten minutes before the onset of brain damage?

No, I didn't know that.
No, I didn't know that.
We learn something new about ourselves every day. Now. Maybe I didn't make myself clear. It is very important that you tell me exactly what Captain Picard knows.

I told you everything. You might as well just kill me right now.
Don't you think you're taking this a little too far, Number One?
When we went to ancient Rome for Deanna's promotion, we threw her to the lions, remember?
Well, now that we're all aboard=8A Number One, bring the ship before the wind. Let's see what's out there.
Aye, aye, sir. Take the wheel, Commander.
Imagine what it was like, Will. No engines, no computers, just the wind, the sea and the stars to guide you.
Bad food, brutal discipline. No women.
Sir?
Make it so.
There's still no indication of why they attacked the station?
We think they were looking for something- they practically tore the place apart.

Hmm, Inform Starfleet Command. This could indicate a new Romulan threat in this sector.

Is there a problem?
Is there a problem?
No, sir.
No, sir.
Thank you, Number One.
There is something else, Captain. One of the scientists, a Doctor Soran,has insisted on speaking with you. I told him you were busy, sir, but he said it was absolutely imperative that he speak with you right away.
Understood. That will be all.
Understood. That will be all.
Sir, is there anything wrong?
Sir, is there anything wrong?
No. Thank you.
Report.
A quantum implosion has occurred within the Amargosa star. All nuclearfusion is breaking down.
A quantum implosion has occurred within the Amargosa star. All nuclearfusion is breaking down.
How is that possible?
Maybe they're not out there.
They're just trying to decide whether a twenty year-old Klingon Bird of Prey is any match for the Federation flagship.
That's a pretty big margin of error.
Too big. How long until the ribbon arrives?
I always thought I'd have a crack at this chair one day.
You may still. Somehow I doubt this will be the last ship to carry the name Enterprise.
Captain, are you all right?
Yes. Fine. If you'll excuse me.
Counselor. What can I do for you?
Actually, I'm here to see if there's anything I can do for you.
Actually, I'm here to see if there's anything I can do for you.
Well, I appreciate your concern, but I'd rather not discuss it right now, thank you.
I'm afraid I can't just leave it at that. The commanding officer of this ship is clearly distraught about something. As ship's counselor, it's my duty to-
As ship's counselor, it's your duty to know not only when you're needed but also when you're not.
As ship's counselor, it's your duty to know not only when you're needed but also when you're not.
You can't fool an empath, Captain. I know exactly when I'm needed.
Well, with all due respect to your Betazoid senses, I prefer to be alone right now.
Very well. I suppose I could make out my weekly report to Starfleet Command without your input. "Admiral Lusby, regarding the unusual behavior of Jean-Luc Picard: I find him increasingly irritable, remote and uncooperative. I recommend forced shore leave at a Starbase facility in order to-"
Very well. I suppose I could make out my weekly report to Starfleet Command without your input. "Admiral Lusby, regarding the unusual behavior of Jean-Luc Picard: I find him increasingly irritable, remote and uncooperative. I recommend forced shore leave at a Starbase facility in order to-"
All right, all right. You've made your point.
Captain, Im sorry. I know there were a lot of unresolved conflicts between you and your brother.
What I can't get out of my mind is the image of Rene- my nephew. I just can't believe he's gone.
It's only natural to feel a heightened sense of tragedy when a child dies. But it goes deeper than that, doesn't it? I can sense that Rene meant a great deal to you.
In a way, he was as close as I ever came to having a child of my own.
Your family history is very important to you, isn't it?
Ever since I was a little boy, I remember hearing about the family line. The Picards that fought at Trafalgar, the Picards that settled the first Martian colony. When my brother married and had a son...
You felt it was no longer your responsibility to carry on the family line.
My brother had shouldered that burden, allowing me to pursue my own selfish needs.
My brother had shouldered that burden, allowing me to pursue my own selfish needs.
There's nothing selfish about pursuing your own life, your own career.
Or perhaps they're on the surface.
Mr. Data, scan the planet for lifeforms.
Doctor Soran?
Yes, yes, Captain. Thank you for coming.
Nothing for me. I understand there's something urgent you need to discuss with me.
Yes. I need to return to the observatory immediately. I must continue a critical experiment I was running on the Amargosa star.
Doctor, we're still conducting an investigation into the attack. Once we've completed our work, we'll be happy to allow you and your fellow scientists back aboard the observatory. Until then-
The timing is very important on my experiment- if it is not completed within the next twelve hours, years of research will be lost.
The timing is very important on my experiment- if it is not completed within the next twelve hours, years of research will be lost.
We're doing the best we can. Now if you'll excuse me...
You must think I'm quite the madman.
The thought had crossed my mind.
The thought had crossed my mind.
The only possible reason you're here is because you're not entirely confident you can shoot down my probe after all. So you've come to dissuade me from my horrific plan. Good luck.
I've spent eighty years looking for another way, Captain. This is the only one. Of course, you could always come with me. You fancy yourself an explorer. Here's a chance to explore something no human has ever experienced.
Not if it means killing over two hundred million people. I wonder, did your wife Leandra know that she married a man who was capable of mass murder?
We're all mortal, Soran. It's one of the truths of ou existence.
What if I told you I found a new truth?
What if I told you I found a new truth?
The Nexus.
The Nexus.
Time has no meaning there. The predator has no teeth.
Careful, Captain. That's a fifty gigawatt forcefield. I wouldn't want to see you get hurt.
Thank you.
The royal...studs?
You see the top yardarm, now look to the-
It looks like we're too late.
There are no other ships in the system.
These blast patterns are consistent with Type III disruptors.
Well, that narrows it to Klingon, Breen or Romulan.
One of the dead Romulans had a tricorder. We analyzed its sensor logs and found they were scanning for signature particles of a compound called trilithium.
Trilithium?
Trilithium?
An experimental compound the Romulans have been working on. In theory, a trilithium-based explosive would be thousands of times more powerful than an anti-matter weapon. But they never found a way to stabilize it.
An experimental compound the Romulans have been working on. In theory, a trilithium-based explosive would be thousands of times more powerful than an anti-matter weapon. But they never found a way to stabilize it.
Why were they looking for it on a Federation observatory? It doesn't make any sense.
Have Geordi and Data go over with the next Away Team. Tell them to scan the observatory for trilithium.
Aye, sir.
Sensor records show a solar probe was launched from the observatory a few moments ago.
The star's going to collapse in a matter of minutes.
I have spoken to the Klingon High Council, sir. They identified the Bird of Prey as belonging to the Duras sisters.
Lursa and B'Etor? This doesn't make any sense. A renowned stellar physicist somehow uses a trilithium probe to destroy a star, kidnaps Geordi and escapes with a pair of Klingon renegades. Why? What the hell's going on?
They have found a way to penetrate our shields.
Lock phasers and return fire!
It is a Class D-12 Bird of Prey. They were retired from service because of defective plasma coils.
Plasma coils...is there any way we can use that to our advantage?
Plasma coils...is there any way we can use that to our advantage?
I do not see how. The plasma coil is part of their cloaking device.
As their cloak begins to engage, their shields will drop.
Right. And they'll be vulnerable for at least two seconds. Data,lock onto that plasma coil.
Worf, prepare a spread of photon torpedoes. We'll have to hit them the instant they begin to cloak.
Aye, sir.
Aye, sir.
We're only going to get one shot at this. Target their primary reactor. With any luck, their warp core should implode.
Status!
All automates ready and functioning. Automatic moorings retracted. All speeds available through transwarp drive.

Shall I alert Dr. McCoy?
Yes. He has a long journey ahead.

I don't believe it...

Why don't we beam it up?
Oh no you don't! Regulations specifically state: "nothing shall be beamed aboard until danger of contamination has been eliminated." Can you guarantee that?

Affirmative, Captain. Our readings are well below danger level.

Jim, in your absence, Genesis has become a galactic controversy... Until the Federation Council makes policy, you are all under orders not to discuss with anyone your knowledge of Genesis... Consider it a quarantined planet. And a forbidden subject.
Jim... You are my best officer and if I had a best friend, you'd be that too. But I am Commander, Starfleet, so I don't break rules!
Don't quote rules, Harry! We're talking about loyalty. And sacrifice. One man who died for us, another who has deep emotional damage --

I say again: Grissom, this is Enterprise. Admiral Kirk calling Captain Esteban or Lieutenant Saavik. Come in!
Report status!

Torpedoes coming in -- !
Do not lecture me about treaty violations. The Federation, in creating an ultimate weapon, has become a gang of Intergalactic criminals. It is not I who will surrender, it is you. On the planet below, I have three prisoners from the team who developed your doomsday weapon. If you do not surrender immediately, I will execute them, one at a time, as enemies of

Admiral, your young friend is mistaken. I meant what I said. And now, to show my intentions are sincere... I am going to kill one of the prisoners.

There are two more prisoners, Admiral. Do you want them killed too? Surrender your vessel!
All right, damn you! All right! Give me a minute to inform my crew.

No tricks, Kirk. You have one minute.

Don't be a fool -- give me your hand!
Ambassador, I -- I had no idea you were here... I think you know my crew...
I will speak with you alone, Kirk.
Sarek... I would have come to Vulcan... to express my deepest sympathies...
Spare me your human platitudes, Kirk. I have been to your Government. I have seen the Genesis information, and your own report.

We are cloaked. Enemy closing on impulse power. Range, 5,000 Kellicams.
Good. This is the turn of luck I have been waiting for.
Why haven't they finished us?... They outgun me ten to one; they have four hundred in crew to my handful, yet they sit there.
Perhaps they wish to take you prisoner.
Perhaps they wish to take you prisoner.
They know we would die first.

They outnumber us, my Lord --

<U>We are Klingons</U>! Once you control the ship, I will transfer my flag there. And we will take Genesis from their own memory banks!

Yes, my lord!
Range: 3000 Kellicams.
Steady. Continue on impulse power.
Firing range, sir.

1,000 Kellicams, closing!
Wait!... Wait...

Shore leave, Admiral.
Ah.
What about the rest of the inspection, Admiral?
The inspection will continue once we're underway, Doctor.
It never rains but when it pours --
As a physician you of all people should appreciate the danger of re-opening old wounds.

Then this will be your big chance to get away from it all.

I've tried to warn you. Scientists are always pawns of the military --
Starfleet has kept the peace for a hundred years, I cannot and will not subscribe to your interpretation of this event.
David --
Mother, go back!
Jim --
Go back. I'm going to kill him.
Go back. I'm going to kill him.
You do that and you'll have murdered your father.
So are we, it looks like.
I don't understand. Who's responsible for all this? Who is Khan?
This? It took the Starfleet corps of engineers ten months in space suits to tunnel out all this. What we did in there -- we did in a day. David, why don't you show Dr. McCoy and the Lieutenant our idea of food.
But we can't just sit here -- !

Only half of you would get there.

The Admiral's son.
The Admiral's son.
Don't you believe it.
Don't you believe it.
Oh, I believe it.
What are <u>you</u> looking at?
I don't know.
Steady on course. All systems normal.
It's not much different from Enterprise. When I was a guest aboard her some years ago, Captain Kirk kindly allowed me to memorize her technical manuals. And now, Mr. Chekov, let us review: You say you have no details of Project 'Genesis' ?
They're requesting visual communications, sir.
Let them eat static.
Let them eat static.
They're still running with shields down.
They're still running with shields down.
Of course. We're one big happy fleet. Ah, Kirk, my old friend, do you know the Klingon proverb that tells us revenge is a dish that is best served cold? It is very cold in space.
Careful: Not all at once. <u>The</u> <u>engine room</u>. Lock on target and prepare to fire.
Locking phasers on target.
Sir -- our shields are dropping!
Raise them --
They won't --
<u>Where's the over-ride</u>??
At them! At them! FIRE! FIRE! Why can't you?
We can't fire, sir; they've damaged the photon controls and the warp drive. We must withdraw!
We can't fire, sir; they've damaged the photon controls and the warp drive. We must withdraw!
No!
No!
Sir, we must! We must repair the damage. Enterprise will wait; she's not going anywhere.
Well?
Warp drive still inoperative. All other systems should be restored shortly.
Departing dark side, Regula.

We'll lose them if they go in there.
Rake her.
No sir! We have Genesis -- Whatever you want --
<u>Full power damn you</u>!
Tactical!
Inoperative.
Inoperative.
Raise the shields...
Yours... is... the superior...
I shall avenge you --
You still remember, Admiral. I cannot help but be touched. Of course, I remember you.
What is the meaning of this attack? Where is the crew of the Reliant?
What is the meaning of this attack? Where is the crew of the Reliant?
Surely I have made my meaning plain. I mean to avenge myself upon you, Admiral. I've deprived your ship of power and when I swing round I mean to deprive you of your life --
-- But I wanted you to know first who it was who had beaten you: I, Khan Noonian Singh, the eagle you attempted to cage forever.
Khan, listen to me -- if its me you want, I'll have myself beamed aboard. All I ask is that you spare my crew.
Khan, listen to me -- if its me you want, I'll have myself beamed aboard. All I ask is that you spare my crew.
That is a most intriguing offer. Typical, I must say of your sterling character. Let me think.

Don't play with me, Kirk, my hand is on the phaser control --

Thirty seconds...
... to prevent an enemy from doing just what we're attempting; using <u>our</u> console to tap in a message, an order to lower Reliant's damn shields...
Khan, how do I know you'll keep your word?
I've given you no word to keep, Admiral. In my judgment, you simply have no alternative.
I've given you no word to keep, Admiral. In my judgment, you simply have no alternative.
I take your point. Stand by to receive our transmission.
Time's up, Admiral...
Here it comes. Now, Spock.
Kirk! Kirk, you are still alive -- my old friend...
Still, 'old friend.' You've managed to kill just about everyone else, but like a poor marksman, you keep missing the target.
Still, 'old friend.' You've managed to kill just about everyone else, but like a poor marksman, you keep missing the target.
Perhaps I no longer need to try.
Goodbye, Admiral. Oh, and don't count on Enterprise. She can't move. My next act will be to blow her out of the heavens.
KHAN!
I don't know you. But you. I never forget a face. Mister Chekov, isn't it? I never thought to see your face again.
Chekov, who is this man?
You are in a position to demand nothing, sir. I, on the other hand, am in a position to grant nothing. What you see is all that remains of the ship's company and the crew of the <u>Botany Bay</u>, marooned here fifteen years ago by Captain James T. Kirk.
Listen to me -- you men and women --
Listen to me -- you men and women --
Save your strength, Captain, these people have sworn to live and die at my command two hundred years before you were born. Do you mean he... ... never told you the tale? To amuse you, Captain?

All is well, sir. You have the coordinates to beam up Genesis...

First things first, Captain. Kill Admiral Kirk.
An emergency situation has arisen. By order of Starfleet Command, as of now, 1800 hours, I am assuming command of this vessel. Duty officer so note in the ship's log. Plot a new course: for Space Laboratory Regula I. Mr. Scott?

Aye, sir.
<u>WHY</u>?
He wants to kill me for passing sentence on him 14 years ago -- and he doesn't care who stands between him and his vengeance.
The energizer's bypassed like a Christmas tree -- so don't give me too many bumps.
No promises, Mr. Scott. On your way.
Admiral, I've got to take the mains off the line. The energizer's shaken loose and I can't get in there to fix her -- radiation --
All right, we'll do the job with auxiliary power.
No, sir! You'll flood the whole compartment...!
He'll die -- !
If he hadn't, we'd be space by now.
Admiral, this is Spock.
Yes, Spock.
Engine room reports auxiliary power restored. We can proceed at impulse power.

Admiral, if we go by the book, like Lieutenant Saavik, hours could seem like days.

Meaning you can't even beam us back?
Not at present.
Spock, this is Kirk. It's two hours. Are you about ready?
Right on schedule, Admiral. Just give us your coordinates and we'll beam you aboard.
And who is this?
Midshipman First Class Peter Preston, engineers mate, SIR.
Your first training voyage, Mr. Preston?
Yes, SIR.
Yes, SIR.
I see. Well, shall we start with the engine room?
I believe you'll find everything shipshape, Admiral.
Oh do you? Have you any idea, Midshipman Preston, how many times I've had to listen to Mr. Scott on the Comm, telling me his troubles? Have you any idea the ribbing I've had to endure in the officers' mess to the effect that the Enterprise is a flying death trap?

At least we know he hasn't got it. Just keep nodding as though I'm giving orders. Saavik, punch up the data charts of Reliant's command console -- hurry...
The prefix code?
It's all we've got.
You've got to learn WHY things work on a Starship. It's coming through now, Khan...
The prefix code is 16309. All commands from each Starship bridge are relayed electronically; each ship has its own prefix combination code...
Let's hope he hasn't changed the combination. He's quite intelligent...
Wait for my signal, Spock -- too soon and he'll have time to figure it out and raise them again.
Scanners and sensors still inoperative. There's no way to tell what's inside the station.

We can't all be perfect, Saavik. You must control your prejudices and remember that as a Vulcan as well as a Romulan you are forever a stranger in an alien land. Around you are humans, and as a member of the Starfleet you are unlikely ever to escape their presence or their influence. You must learn to tolerance in addition to all else I
Very well, Mr. Saavik, clear all moorings.
Aye, sir.
All moorings are clear, Captain.
Thank you, Mr. Saavik.
Lieutenant, how many times have you piloted a Starship out of Spacedock?
Never, sir.
Take her out, Mr. Saavik.
Aye, sir.
Sir, may I quote General Order 12: 'On the approach of any vessel, when communications have not been est --

I don't know about you, but my compassion for someone is not limited to my estimate of their intelligence. I mean whales may not have painted the Mona Lisa or invented the dirt bike but they didn't ravish the land either.
Sorry if I spoke out of turn.
Not at all. You gave me things to think about. You always do. You do sound a little wrecked, why don't you go home and stare at the ceiling?

Gillian --
Professor Scott, I'm Dr. Nichols, plant manager. I'm terribly sorry but there's been an awful mix-up Would you believe I was never told about your visit?
I tried to clear things up, Professor Scott. I explained you'd come all the way from Edinburgh on appointment to study manufacturing methods here at Plexico, but they don't seem to know anything about it.
Well, so much for the tour of our humble plant. I must say, Professor your knowledge of engineering is most impressive.
Back home, we call him the miracle worker.

Indeed... May I offer you gentlemen anything?

Please...
No! No... What did you have in mind...?
A moment alone, please.
You'd think they could at least send a ship. Bad enough to be court marshaled and spend the rest of our lives mining borite -- but to come home in this Klingon flea trap...
We could learn a thing or two from this flea trap. It has a cloaking device that cost us a lot.

Mr. Sulu... Take us home...
Bones --
Dammit, Jim, they've made him into a goddam green-blooded computer!
Bones, stay here.
No way -- somebody has to keep an eye on him!
Now wait just a damn minute.
Spock, start your computations for time warp. Come on, Bones. Let's pay Scotty a visit.
You're really going to try this time travel in this rust bucket?
We've done it before.
We've done it before.
Sure, slingshot around the Sun. If you pick up enough speed you're in time warp. If you don't, you fry..

Would you prefer to do nothing?
I prefer a dose of common sense. you are proposing to head backwards in time, find Humpback Whales, then bring them forward in time, drop them off - and hope they tell this Probe what to do with itself!
-- That's the general idea.

That's crazy!

If you have a better idea - now's the time.
It doesn't look all that different.
Let's hope so, Bones. Mr. Sulu, set us down in Golden Gate Park.
Oh, joy.
Captain Spock and I will attempt to trace these whale songs to their source.
Jim, you've got to let me go in there! Don't leave him in the hands of Twentieth Century medicine.
What do you think, Spock?
What did you say she was getting?
Cramps.
An experimental device, doctor.
Tearing of the middle meningeal artery...
Wake up, man, wake up!
Come on, Pavel...
He's coming 'round, Jim...
Pavel, can you hear me? Give me your name and rank...
Congratulations, Jim. I think you've saved the Earth.
Not me, Bones... They did it.
Hi... Busy?
Uhura is busy. I am monitoring.

Specifically, Humpback Whales.
That's crazy! Who would send a probe hundreds of light years to talk to a whale?
10 million years earlier. Humpbacks were heavily hunted by Man. They have been extinct since the 21st Century... It is possible that an alien intelligence sent the probe to determine why they lost contact.
... My God...
You just said there aren't any except on Earth of the past.
That is what I said, Doctor.

Then how.?

They like you very much. But they are not the hell your whales.
I suppose they told you that...?

The hell they did.
So you were at Berkeley.
I was not.
Are you sure it isn't time for a colorful metaphor?
You're not one of those guys from the military, are you? Trying to teach whales to retrieve torpedoes, or some dipshit stuff like that?
You sure you won't change your mind?
Is there something wrong with the one I have?
You mean man...
To put it mildly. Since the dawn of time, men have harvested whales for a variety of purposes, most of which can be achieved synthetically at this point. A hundred years ago, using hand-thrown harpoons, they did plenty of damage -- but that was nothing compared to what they've achieved in this century.
They are mature humpbacks, weighing 45,000 pounds each. They wandered into San Francisco Bay as calves and were brought here. We call them George and Gracie.
It's perfect, Spock: a male, a female, together in a contained space can beam them up together and consider ourselves damn lucky...
Despite all the things they are teaching us we have to return George and Gracie to the open sea.
Why's that?
Why's that?
Well, for one thing, we simply don't have the money to keep feeding them a couple of tons of shrimp a day!

Soon... It's too bad because they're very friendly as you can see. I've grown quite attached to them... This way.
Ohhh<u>kay</u>. I don't know what this is about, but I want you guys outta here right now or I call the cops.
I assure you that won't be necessary. We were only trying to help...

It means that they will be at risk from whale hunters -- same as the rest of the humpbacks. What did you mean when you said all that stuff back at the Institute about extinction?
No, ma'am. No dipshit.
Well, that's something. I'da let you off right here.
All right. Who are you? and don't jerk me around any more. I want to know how you know that.
We can't tell you. Please, just -- let me finish. I can tell you that we're not in the military and that we intend no harm to the whales.

Spock -- you're suggesting the transmission is meant for life form other than man?
A distinct possibility, Admiral. The President did say the transmission was directed at the Earth's Oceans

Uhura... Can you modify the Probe's signals by accounting for density temperature and salinity factors?
Where are you going?!
To the on-board computer room. To confirm my suspicion.
Spock...?
As suspected, the Probe's transmissions are the songs sung by whales.

If memory serves, there was a dubious flirtation with nuclear fission reactors resulting in toxic side effects. By the beginning of the fusion era, these reactors had been replaced, but at this time, we should be able to find some.

Weren't those a birthday present from Dr. McCoy?
And they will be again, Spock. That's the beauty of it. How much?
Well, Spock, thanks to your restored memory and a little bit of luck, we are in the streets of San Francisco looking for a pair of humpback whales. How do you propose to solve this minor problem?
Simple logic will suffice. We need a map. That one should do.
I think we'll find what we're looking for at the Cetacean Institute in Sausalito. Two Humpbacks called George and Gracie.
How do you know this...?

Come on, fellah -- speak up!
Admiral, if we were to assume these. whales are ours to do with as we please, we would be as guilty as those who caused their extinction.

Mr. Sulu, take the con. I'm taking our guest down to see her whales. Mr. Spock: have you accounted for the variable mass of whales and water in your time re-entry program?
Mr. Scott cannot give me exact figures, Admiral. So I will... Make a <u>guess</u>.

Can we make breakaway speed!?
Hardly, Admiral, I cannot even guarantee we will escape the Sun's gravity! I will attempt to compensate by altering our trajectory.
Spock... Did braking thrusters fire?
They did, Admiral.
They did, Admiral.
Then... Where the hell are we?
Spock: Condition report!
No data, Admiral. Computers are non-functional.
You got us to the right place, Spock. Now all we have to do is get the whales out before we <u>sink</u>. Mr. Scott, come in!... Scotty...?! Damn... Mr. Spock, see to the safety of all hands.
I will, Admiral.

Admiral, I am receiving whale songs.
On speakers.
Individual whale song getting stronger... This is strange, Admiral. The song is directly ahead. It's coming from San Francisco.
From a city? That doesn't make sense....
I'll have bearing and distance for you, sir.
Right. Now look: I want you all to be very careful. This is terra incognita. Many customs will doubtless take us by surprise. It's a forgone conclusion these people have never seen an extra-terrestrial before.
We'll stick together till we get orientated. Bearing to the whales?

Mr. Scott -- how soon?
I can't, sir -- Nothing!
Out of control, and blind as a bat!
Mr. Scott, how soon can we get underway?
Give me one more day, sir. The damage control is easy. Reading Klingon is hard.
We're ready, sir. I've converted the Dilithium Sequencer to something less primitive. And Admiral -- I've replaced the Klingon Food Packs. They was givin' me sour stomach.
Appreciated by all, Mr. Scott. Prepare for departure.
Scotty, how long is this bay?
About 60 feet, Admiral.
About 60 feet, Admiral.

Oh, twenty-four hours, give or take, staying cloaked. After that, Admiral, we'll be visible -- and dead in the water. In any case, we won't have enough to break out of the Earth's gravity, to say nothing of getting back home.
I can't believe we've come this far only to be stopped by this! Scotty, is there any way dilithium can be re-crystallized?
Sorry, sir. We can't even do that in the 23rd Century.
What is it? I thought I told you never to call me --
Sorry, Admiral. We just thought you'll like to know, we're beaming them now.
Sorry, Admiral. We just thought you'll like to know, we're beaming them now.

It's going slow, sir. It'll be well into tomorrow.
Not good enough, Scotty. You've got to do better!
Not good enough, Scotty. You've got to do better!
I'll try, sir. Scott out. Well now, he's got himself in a bit of a snit, don't he.
I'm ready Spock. Let's go find George and Gracie...
Mr. Sulu?
Scotty: Are the whale tanks secure?
Aye. But I've never beamed up 400 tons before.
Stay with me, sir -- I need more power curve...
How long, Scotty?

Even as the Federation negotiated a peace treaty with us, Kirk was secretly developing the Genesis torpedo! Conceived by Kirk's son and test detonated by the Admiral himself! The result of this awesome energy was euphemistically called "The Genesis Planet..." A secret base from which to launch the. annihilation of the Klingon people! We demand the extradition of Kirk! We demand justice!
Klingon justice is a unique point of view, Mr. President.
Genesis was perfectly named: The creation of life not death. It was the Klingons who had first blood while trying to possess its secrets.

To move you off this planet. You go to sleep one night in your village... wake up the next morning in this flying holodeck transported en masse. A week later, maybe a month, you've been relocated on a similar planet without ever realizing it.
Don't panic...
I've been shot at... thrown into the lake out of an invisible ship that's come to abduct us all... what's there to panic about?
There's an unusual metaphasic radiation coming from the planet's rings. It continuously regenerates the cells in our bodies. You must have noticed the effects by now.
We've... just begun to. I suppose you're seventy-five.
Clearly, the architects of this conspiracy have tried to keep it a secret. Not just from you, but from my people as well. I don't intend to let them.

Right beyond that ridge is where the caves begin... we can hide for days...

How is it a woman like you never married? And don't tell me you "just haven't gotten around to it yet"...
What's the rush?
What's the rush?
I should warn you... I've always been attracted to older women...
There's a cavern at the base of the next hill...
This way!
You're Ro'tin, aren't you...? There's something in the voice. Would you be his friend Gal'na? I helped your mother bathe you when you were a child. She still speaks of you.
You've brought the Federation into the middle of a blood feud, Admiral. The children have returned to expel their elders... just as they were once expelled. Except Ru'afo's need for revenge has now escalated to parricide.
Mother and son. You arranged this...?
I thought it might begin the healing process.
But I have three hundred and eighteen days of vacation time coming. I plan on using them.
I'll be here.
Do you really think your mighty Federation would be interested in protecting six hundred people?
The "mighty" Federation could learn a few things from this village...
There is no need for concern. I am operating within normal parameters now.
You're what?
You're what?
I am better.
My father told me I shouldn't talk to you.
I understand.
I understand.
I don't.
Not everyone here agrees with him. I mean, you know, about machines. There was even a big fight about it once. Do you like being a machine?
I aspire to be more than I am.
I aspire to be more than I am.
I know why. So people like us won't be afraid of you any more.

For one thing, your legs are shorter than everyone else's.

Sometimes I do.

My legs are eighty-seven-point- two centimeters. They were eighty-seven-point-two centimeters the day I was created. They will be eighty- seven-point-two centimeters the day I go off line. My operation depends on specifications that do not change. I... cannot imagine... the experience of growing up or even tripping over my own feet...
But you've never had adults telling you what to do all the time... or bedtimes... or having to eat food you don't like...
I would gladly accept the requirement of a bedtime in exchange for knowing what it is like to be a child.

Data doesn't breathe.

Won't he rust?

No.
To many offlanders, what you have here would be more valuable than gold-pressed latinum. And I'm afraid it's the reason that someone is trying to take this world away from you.
The artificial lifeform was right?

If not for Data, you'd probably have been re-located by now.
Captain, the Son'a hostages declined to be examined. I had them confined to quarters.
And our people?

Sure it is. And your hair is still chestnut brown.
Very funny...
Your Captain used to cut quite a rug...
Prepare to transport the 'hostages' to the ship...
They should be quarantined before joining the ship's population.
Will he live?
Yes. But look at this medscan...
She's stabilizing.
Is it safe to move her?

Safer than leaving her here.

How about a passive radiation scan?
A ship,
It is clearly Federation in origin, Captain.

'Just a few loose ends to tie up.'
Incomplete, I might add.
What you're seeing is a computer driven image created by photons and forcefields...
... it is conceivable I was shot to protect the secret of its existence.
What possible purpose could a duplicate village have except... to deceive the Ba'ku...
Why would the Federation or the Son'a wish to move the Ba'ku?
I don't know.
Captain, I've activated transport inhibitors around the village...
Good. Let's begin to move these people out...
How many?
Another forty-three people reported taken, sir...
I'm showing fresh air behind this calcite formation, Captain...
Will the structure hold if we blast through?

Take us into a high orbit. Lie down, Admiral. The girls will take twenty years off your face...
Another time.
Your self-restraint puzzles me, Admiral. You continue to deny yourself every benefit this mission has to offer...
I prefer to wait until we can share the benefits with all the people of the Federation...
Your android has turned dangerously violent, Captain... Considerable damage was done to my ship. He must be destroyed.
I know what Data means to Starfleet, Jean-Luc... but our crew is at the mercy of those people on the planet...
It isn't safe for you to remain in this area.
He's right. Our shields have been upgraded to protect against the environmental anomalies...
Take me down. Let me talk to Picard.
Talk... we should send down an assault team and take them by force.

That is not an acceptable option. If people get hurt, all the support we have in the Federation...
That is not an acceptable option. If people get hurt, all the support we have in the Federation...
Federation support, Federation procedures, Federation rules... look in the mirror, Admiral... the Federation is old... in the last twenty four months, it's been challenged by every major power in the quadrant -- the Borg, the Cardassians, the Dominion... they all smell the scent of death on the Federation. That's why you've embraced our offer... because it will give your dear Federation new life. Well,
I'll order Riker to turn around.
Picard's first officer. Do you really believe he'll listen?
You're not going to launch anything until...
In six hours, every living thing in this system will be dead or dying.
We're taking this ship out of here... this mission is over...
It is not over.
It is not over.
It is over.
I do not take orders from you.
If you begin the procedure while the planet is still populated, the Federation will pursue you until...
You have no idea what precipitated his behavior?

We haven't fully identified the anomalies yet. They're calling this whole area The Briar Patch... it took us a day to reach a location where we could get a signal out to you. Just get me Data's schematics. I'll keep you informed. Dougherty out.
Captain, I wasn't expecting you.
This was too important for the Enterprise to be on the sidelines, Admiral...

Understood.

Good luck. Dougherty out.

The Ba'ku.
We are betraying the principles upon which the Federation was founded... this is an attack on the very soul of the Federation. This will destroy the Ba'ku. Just as cultures have been destroyed in every other forced relocation throughout history.
We are only moving six hundred people, Jean-Luc.

Order them to surrender, and I promise you won't be court- martialed.
If a court-martial is the only way to tell the people of the Federation what happened here, then I welcome it.
I wonder... which one of us will be facing that court-martial...
There's nothing further to be gained from this...
A coward... without the moral courage to stop an unspeakable atrocity. You offend me.
Is this how a Federation officer begs for his life?

No, sir. But it wasn't easy... being among them...
No, sir. But it wasn't easy... being among them...
I'm sure. Just don't forget what they did to us. We'll have them rounded up in a day or two... we needn't bother with the Federation holo-ship any more. Just get the holding cells ready.
The injector performs perfectly in every simulation...
Sir, as the Enterprise left orbit, one of their support craft went down to the surface. It appeared to be the Captain's Yacht. Five persons on board.

We're not waiting until morning... take the shuttles and get everyone off the surface tonight.
They're following the kelbonite deposits... using the interference to block our transporters...
Recommendations?
There is an alternative to an all- out assault. Isolinear tags would allow our transporters to lock on to them.
We'd have to tag every one of them... that would take time... and we don't have it. The Enterprise is only nineteen hours from communications range with the Federation...
Admiral Dougherty will not be joining us for diner. Deploy the collector. Do you have a problem with those orders?
May I talk to you alone?
May I talk to you alone?
Deploy the collector.
Moving them is one thing. Killing them all...
No one hated them more than you, Gal'na. We've come a long way together. This is the moment we've planned for so many years...

And yet he attacked us. And told the Ba'ku we were a threat...
Implants bothering you?
It's nothing. I'm just tired.
Funniest thing, Captain. There wasn't anything wrong with my implants. There was something right with my eyes. When Doctor Crusher removed the ocular connections, she found the cells around my optic nerves...

It may not last after we leave. If not, I just wanted, before we go... I've never actually seen a sunrise.

We're still thirty-six minutes from transmission range, sir.
We're through running from these bastards.

As you wish. But I would ask you to disarm yourselves. This village is a sanctuary of life.
We came here from a solar system on the verge of self- annihilation... where technology had created weapons that threatened to destroy all life. A small group of us set off to find a new home... a home that would be isolated from the threats of other worlds. That was three hundred and nine years ago.
You've not aged a day since then?

Worf, what the hell are you doing here?
I've already modified a tricorder with one of his spare actuation servos. Its operational range is only seven meters but it should shut him down...
It's good to have you back, Worf. Slow to one-third. Take us in.
Sensors are not picking up any ships coming from the surface...

Sir, if we fire a tachyon burst, it may force him to reset his shield harmonics. When he does, we could beam him out...
Make it so.
Direct hit. He's resetting his shield harmonics...
Beam him out!
He's activated a transport inhibitor.
Prepare to enter the atmosphere... we'll use the ionospheric boundary to shake him...

They're composers, Worf, from the nineteenth century. Data was rehearsing a part in H.M.S. Pinafore before he left... "A British tar is a soaring soul, As free as a mountain bird, His energetic first should be ready to resist A dictatorial word..."
Sir, inertial coupling is exceeding tolerance... if we don't release him, he may destroy both vessels...
I'm not letting go of him.
The damping sequencer was damaged by phaser fire!
Transferring controls to manual.
Did any of the hostages mention a cloaked ship during their debriefings?
No, sir...
No, sir...
Debrief them again. Have you been in a fight, Commander?
Debrief them again. Have you been in a fight, Commander?
No, sir. It is a gorch.
No, sir. It is a gorch.
Gorch?
Doctor Crusher asked to talk to you when you returned...
Picard to Crusher...
Should I distribute phasers to the Ba'ku, sir...?
No. We'll be responsible for that, Mister Worf.
You need a haircut, Commander.
Accelerated hair growth is often experienced by Klingons during Jak'tahla...
The Ba'ku could use some rest, sir. According to the geo-scan, this may be the safest area for the next few kilometers...
Very well. We'll take an hour. Break out some rations...
Isolinear tags. Their transporters can lock onto them.
We have to find shelter...
All injector sub-systems are confirmed off-line.
Decloak the holo-ship and engage a tractor beam, Mister Worf.
One. It's Ru'afo.
Can you beam him off?
Can you beam him off?
Negative. He's established a security field around the control room...
Negative. He's established a security field around the control room...
Is there any other way to disable the injector?
... Population three hundred million...
Say the greeting again...
Say the greeting again...
Yew-cheen chef-faw... emphasis on the 'cheen' and the 'faw'...
Oh, my God, are they vegetarians? That's not in here...
Better have the chef whip up a light balsamic vinaigrette... something that goes well with chrysanthemums...
We've downloaded all the files on the duck blind mission as well as intelligence reports on the Son'a.
You have two days to become experts... Mister Worf, your job and mine will be to find a plan to safely capture Data.
Counselor?
They have an incredible clarity of perception, Captain. I've never encountered a species with such mental discipline...
The Son'a discovered an M-class planet with humanoid life six months ago. Turned out it's in us to get approval for a sociological study. The Federation Council suggested it be a joint mission...
Why was Data assigned?
Why was Data assigned?
"Environmental concerns", again. An android could be safely exposed to the elements during the installation of a duck blind...
I don't see anything to suggest the Son'a have any interest in sociology...
What are they interested in...?
What are they interested in...?
Wine, women and song.
Wine, women and song.
You should feel right at home with them.
Nomadic, collectors of precious metals, jewels...
Hmm, I should feel right at home with them...
Hmm, I should feel right at home with them...
You're in luck... it says here they've taken women from several races as indentured servants.
Why would we be involved with these people?
Good question.
You haven't done that in a long time...
What...?
What...?
What you're doing to my neck...
What you're doing to my neck...
Was I doing something to your neck?
It says here that some form of genetic damage has apparently prevented the Son'a from procreating...
No children?
No children?
If that's true, they're a dying race.
Come in. Hi.
Got a minute? I... need a little counseling. First time for everything. Do I... lie down... or what?
Got a minute? I... need a little counseling. First time for everything. Do I... lie down... or what?
Whatever makes you comfortable...
This isn't one of the usual therapeutic postures...
But it's comfortable.
But it's comfortable.
Why don't you try sitting up?
Why don't you try sitting up?
Or you could try lying down.
Or you could try lying down.
You're in quite a mood today.
Both. I think I'm having a mid-life crisis...
... I believe you...
... I believe you...
... I'm not sleeping well...
... I'm not sleeping well...
... Doctor Crusher has something that'll take care of that...
What I need, I can't get from Doctor Crusher... Counselor, do you think it's possible for two people to go back in time to fix a mistake they've made?
On this ship, anything can happen. And usually does.
Augh.
Augh?
Augh?
I never kissed you with a beard before.
All hands. Battle stations!
And have you noticed how your boobs have started to firm up?
Initiate launch sequence.
Activating injector assembly.
Exactly as the simulations predicted...
Sir, I am not showing any change in metaphasic flux levels...
Sir, I am not showing any change in metaphasic flux levels...
Your scanners must be malfunctioning.
Your scanners must be malfunctioning.
All ship functions are off-line.
This ship is equipped with fourteen long range transporters... are they all useless...?
They must have been locked and secured after we were beamed here.
They must have been locked and secured after we were beamed here.
Isolate one and re-route its command sequence through the auxiliary processor...
The new quantum torpedoes are doing the trick, Jean-Luc. We've destroyed forty-seven Borg ships so far... and only lost fifteen of our own. But one of the Borg ships has broken through our defenses, and it's heading directly for Earth. Can you handle it?
Absolutely.
Absolutely.
Good hunting. Hayes out.
Good hunting. Hayes out.
Mister Data, set a pursuit course. Maximum warp.
Admiral... what's the status of the Borg fleet?
It's been destroyed. The Borg threat is over. Are you all right? The Enterprise disappeared from our sensors for a moment.
It's been destroyed. The Borg threat is over. Are you all right? The Enterprise disappeared from our sensors for a moment.
We're fine, sir. It will take some... time to explain.
We're fine, sir. It will take some... time to explain.
I look forward to reading your report.
Montana. Energize.
Montana? Well, that answers everything. Why the hell are we --
Go where? Hello? Is anyone going to tell me what we're doing here?
We're here to find Zephram Cochrane. He may be injured or dead.
We're here to find Zephram Cochrane. He may be injured or dead.
Cochrane... the inventor of warp drive?
Cochrane... the inventor of warp drive?
Yes...
Yes...
But he's been dead for three hundred... Oh God... we've gone back in time again, haven't we?
But he's been dead for three hundred... Oh God... we've gone back in time again, haven't we?
I'm afraid so. If the Borg succeed in preventing First Contact with the Vulcans... Earth will remain in the Second Dark Age... an easy target when the Borg arrive in the 24th century.
I'm afraid so. If the Borg succeed in preventing First Contact with the Vulcans... Earth will remain in the Second Dark Age... an easy target when the Borg arrive in the 24th century.
Well, why didn't you just say so in the first place?
It's Cochrane.
I've stabilized him for now... but he's in a coma and he's going to need radiometric therapy. I want to take him to the ship.
It's not the radiation... and there's nothing wrong with the combadges... the Enterprise just isn't responding.
Jean-Luc, this man needs medical attention, now.
Jean-Luc, this man needs medical attention, now.
As I recall, the town of Resurrection is about two kilometers East of here. They might have a hospital...
What are we waiting for? Let's go.
It may not be that simple. This is an extremely difficult and paranoid time in human history.
It may not be that simple. This is an extremely difficult and paranoid time in human history.
Are you saying they won't help us?
Are you saying they won't help us?
I'm saying they might shoot us on sight. You have to remember... these people have watched their entire way of life collapse around them.

There must be some good people... even in this time.
There must be some good people... even in this time.
Let's hope so. Because if Cochrane dies... the future may die with him.
He's stable... for now. But it would be better if we could contact... our friends.
Yes. But until then, you'll have to make do with what you've got.
Yes. But until then, you'll have to make do with what you've got.
That'll be interesting.
I have to go back to the silo. Will you be all right?
I'll be fine. He's a different story.
You actually performed surgery...?
It was an experience. Metal scalpels... needle and thread...
But I had a little help. Surgical transporter. I used it to beam out most of the bone fragments from his brain.
How did Doctor Almack react to that?
How did Doctor Almack react to that?
He was so confused by what I was doing, I don't think he even noticed. Any word from the Enterprise?

Not yet.
Not yet.
You think they're still up there?
You think they're still up there?
If they're not... we'd better get used to living in Montana.
If they're not... we'd better get used to living in Montana.
That might not be so bad... at least for you.
Regardless of how I may feel about Ruby... our fates lie along different paths. Nothing can change that.
You want some advice? Don't do this again. You know exactly what I mean.
You want some advice? Don't do this again. You know exactly what I mean.
Beverly, there were many reasons why you and I...
Beverly, there were many reasons why you and I...
I'd call them excuses. And the first excuse on both our lists was our "sense of duty." We convinced ourselves that it was more important than anything else. And you know what? It's not.
How long has he been unconscious?
At least four hours.
Is it Japanese?
Um... yeah. Now he's going to need a respirator. Do you have one?
Um... yeah. Now he's going to need a respirator. Do you have one?
We have two... but we don't have the juice to run them.
His automatic reflexes are fluctuating. We've got to get him on a respirator.
Bag him.
The occipital fracture is widening... we're going to have to fuse the bones...
I'm a little worried about some of these bone fragments. If they move any closer to the brain, we could be looking at a hemorrhage.
You are the guiding intelligence behind the Borg...?
Intelligence... ambition... desire... I bring order to chaos...
Have you ever wondered what it's like to have flesh?
It is impossible to imagine sensations for which I have no frame of reference.
You've taken your first step toward perfection. How does it feel?
I do not know what you are referring to.
I do not know what you are referring to.
That's because you haven't been properly... stimulated yet.
Do you know what this is, Data?
It would appear that you are attempting to graft organic skin onto my endo-skeletal structure.
It would appear that you are attempting to graft organic skin onto my endo-skeletal structure.
What a cold description... for such a beautiful gift.
No. I will not betray my friends.
They're not your friends... they've held you back... kept you from your destiny...
They're not your friends... they've held you back... kept you from your destiny...
That is not true. They have tried to help me.
That is not true. They have tried to help me.
Have they given you what I have given you? Did they even try?
Have they given you what I have given you? Did they even try?
I... do not want this...
You're becoming more human all the time, Data. Now you're learning how to lie.
I wish to... go back to the way I was.
I wish to... go back to the way I was.
More lies.
Have you ever know a woman? Do you know what it's like to feel her breath on your face... her skin against yours... flesh against flesh?
My creator did not intend for me to experience these things.
My creator did not intend for me to experience these things.
I'm your creator now.
I am... grateful for what you have given me. But I still do not wish to be assimilated.
A universe of sensation is waiting for you... don't you want to explore it... with me?
Yes...
Then take the final step... give me the Enterprise... and we can be together... always.
I've deactivated the sensory inputs. That flesh on your body is just meat, now.
No... no, please... you cannot...
Isn't it better like this...?
Yes... but the Enterprise... my duty...
Yes... but the Enterprise... my duty...
... is to yourself. Don't make me hurt you again...
No... no, it's so... empty... please... give it back... I need it...
And I need to control this ship. Let me into your mind.
There is a perimeter alert. A ship has entered sensor range.
Vulcan?
Vulcan?
No.
Your diagnostics are in error. I need weapons.
The problem must lie in the interface between Starfleet and Borg technology. Your console may not be configured to handle the data flow.

Can you configure it?
Can you configure it?
I believe so.
I believe so.
Do it.
Dispersive armor is holding.
Bring us about. Target Borg ship alpha four, port side battery.
The Borg ship has modified its shields, Captain. Our phasers will no longer be effective.
Ready quantum torpedo.
We are approaching the Terran System, Captain.
Go to impulse. Where's the Borg ship?
Go to impulse. Where's the Borg ship?
It has entered Earth orbit. Correction -- it is not in orbit. It is heading directly toward the surface.
It has entered Earth orbit. Correction -- it is not in orbit. It is heading directly toward the surface.
What?
I have helm control.
Where's the Sphere?
The vortex is collapsing, sir.
Contact Starfleet Command.
What year is it?
According to our astrometric readings... the year is 2063.
Mister Data, I want to know the exact date and time. Give me a damage report on that missile silo.
Today is March second, 2063. The time in Montana is oh-eight-forty- five.
But now... they are all one with the Borg.
I am unlike any lifeform you have encountered before. As an android, I am in complete control of my neural net. The information contained there cannot be forcibly removed.

You are an imperfect being... created by an imperfect being. Finding your weakness is only a matter of time.
Who are you?
I am the Borg.
I am the Borg.
That is a contradiction. The Borg act as a collective consciousness. There are no individuals.
That is a contradiction. The Borg act as a collective consciousness. There are no individuals.
I am the beginning... the end. I am the one who is many. I am the Borg.
The planet's surface is covered with Borg technology. So is the moon... and three other planets in this solar system.
But how?
Did you know her?
Not very well. We met shortly after the Enterprise-E was commissioned. I found her to be a most... promising officer.
Data... are you sure you're all right?
I am still having difficulty integrating certain emotions into my programming. Grief, loss, remorse...
I am still having difficulty integrating certain emotions into my programming. Grief, loss, remorse...
We still have to make reports on ten more crewmen killed in action. Maybe you should deactivate your emotion chip until we're done.
No. Human beings do not have that luxury, and neither should I.
I will admit... there are times when I wish I had an emotion chip I could turn on and off.
"APR cell count?" What the hell are you talking about?
Doctor Crusher has been... studying some advanced medical theories.
Juice?
Power. There hasn't been a lot of wind through here for the last couple of weeks. Most of the batteries are depleted.
Where's the battery room for the hospital?
I told you, there's no --
I told you, there's no --
Where?
Where?
Outside, around back. Next to the water tank.
What did you do to the batteries?
Oh... just a little tinkering. How is he?
Captain, I'm starting to worry about the hull integrity. We've been running the support field at full power for three hours straight. I don't know how much longer it's going to hold up.
Understood. Keep me informed.
I have the silo, sir. Bearing three one zero... distance, three hundred meters.
Let's go.
This must be it.
How serious is the damage?
How serious is the damage?
I'm having trouble scanning underground. There's a lot of radiation leaking from something.
I'm having trouble scanning underground. There's a lot of radiation leaking from something.
Probably from the nuclear warhead. Cochrane was planning to use it to ignite the warp drive.
I'm picking up faint life signs twenty meters below.
There should be an access hatch nearby...
Alphanumeric lock. We need a password to get in...
I have the password right here.
Blast door. It's designed to protect the control room when the missile is launched.
There should be some kind of manual release...
Picard to Enterprise. Enterprise, please respond.
It could be the radiation, Captain. Try from the surface.
This used to be the throttle valve assembly. It controls the thrust of the engines. It's been completely vaporized... and without it, there's no way to launch the ship.
Can you reconstruct the throttle valve?
Can you reconstruct the throttle valve?
Yeah... if I knew what it looked like. There's probably five hundred ways to design a valve like this...
Yeah... if I knew what it looked like. There's probably five hundred ways to design a valve like this...
We need to launch this ship in under eighteen hours... There must be some design schematics... blueprints...
We need to launch this ship in under eighteen hours... There must be some design schematics... blueprints...
We're tearing this place apart looking for them... but the computers are down, and the fires destroyed half the files...so far, nothing.
Maybe... Sure. Yeah. As long as I could get a clear look at the intake configuration. But so far, we haven't found any other photos.
If there are other photographs... I think I may know how to find them.
Where's you get the alloy for the throttle itself?
They used copper pipes in their plumbing... so I melted it down... and fused it with some tritanium from one of our phaser casings. It's not the strongest alloy... but it's better than all this crude aluminum and steel.
Ready to make a little history?
Always am.
Always am.
Phoenix to control. Initiating five minute countdown... mark.
We can't leave her out there. When the ship launches... she'll be killed.
Tell her to go back to Resurrection.
Tell her to go back to Resurrection.
She's a very... determined woman. Phoenix to control. Mister Lange... let her in.
Captain --
This is Picard. I've suspended the launch sequence.
Captain... we've got less than ten minutes before that Vulcan ship leaves the system. We've got to go <U>now</U>.
It'll have to wait. Come on.
No... the door's too thick.
Then we'll just have to assume it's still there...
Then we'll just have to assume it's still there...
What's still there?

Get a tricorder. You're going to have to track my exact position in that room...

Ignore it. We'll be fine. Prepare for first stage shut-down and separation on my mark...
Ready to deploy the warp nacelles.
As they used to say... all systems are go.
The Vulcans should be out there right now. We need to break the warp barrier in the next five minutes if we're going to get their attention.
Bring the warp core on-line. I'll lay in a heading.
Bring the warp core on-line. I'll lay in a heading.
The nacelles are charged... nuclear warhead standing by. We're ready to ignite the warp drive.

Passing one-half light speed. The starboard nacelle's running a little hot...
I'm on it...
The inertial dampers are having trouble compensating... I don't think Cochrane built this thing for comfort.
Speed -- two hundred, seventy-five thousand kilometers per second.
There's no temporal shielding in here! We're starting to pick up relativistic effects!
One minute to warp threshold...
Captain, the Enterprise!
Picard to Enterprise. Picard to Enterprise -- do you read me?
Their com system must still be down.
Well, I feel a whole lot better with them out there. We may need some help.
They're getting awfully close... what the hell are they doing?
We're crossing the threshold!
Are we on schedule? The Vulcan ship will be here in less than two hours.
It'll be tight, but we should make it.
It'll be tight, but we should make it.
What about our warp signature? It has to be strong enough for them to detect.

You don't sound French.
Where in the States?
Oh... here and there. You know how it is.

Beautiful city. Used to be, anyway. I didn't think anyone still lived there.
Beautiful city. Used to be, anyway. I didn't think anyone still lived there.
There's a few of us left.
That was a pretty clever trick you did with the hospital's batteries. How'd you do it?
It wasn't a trick. I used to be an electrical engineer.
It wasn't a trick. I used to be an electrical engineer.
Huh.
And what were you doing out at the missile silo?
I'm an old friend of Cochrane's... I wanted to see how he was doing.

Lucky for him you came by when you did. He might be dead now.

Maybe you can tell me what he's been doing in that silo. We heard some explosions out there this morning...
Maybe you can tell me what he's been doing in that silo. We heard some explosions out there this morning...
I think he was running a test on an old rocket engine... and one of the fuel cells burst.
You seem to have an answer for everything.
Something wrong with that?
Something wrong with that?
Not yet.
What do you want?
The invasion plans.
The invasion plans.
Invasion.
Invasion.
These people you're calling "Vulcans"... who are they? Where do they come from? How many troops? What kind of weapons?
There is no invasion...
Wrong answer, Mister Picard. Try again.
From another planet. Oh, I almost forgot... they have green blood and pointed ears.
And you know all this... because <U>you're</U> a space-man too...
And you know all this... because <U>you're</U> a space-man too...
I'm afraid you've caught me. I am a space-man.
Take care of him. He's a very special man.
Yes, he is.
What are you, an idiot? Didn't you see the red light was on?
Ah... yes... but, I didn't realize that --
Ah... yes... but, I didn't realize that --
Thank God this plate was already fixed.
Cochrane?
Yes... and I only had enough silver halide for one shot. So you're lucky you didn't screw it up.
Yes... and I only had enough silver halide for one shot. So you're lucky you didn't screw it up.
I'm very sorry.
Did you need something?
Yes... I wanted to ask you about some photographs I saw out at the silo. There were three of them... printed on some kind of fabric.
Yes... I wanted to ask you about some photographs I saw out at the silo. There were three of them... printed on some kind of fabric.
Bed sheets. I used my last set of bed sheets to make those prints. Not the best material, but I haven't seen a clean piece of paper in five years.

Did you take any other pictures of the rocket?
"Money." So you can get dome money...
I can try.
I can try.
You'd have to try real hard. No one's used currency in over ten years. What are you, from another planet?
No... but sometimes I feel that way. What I meant was, I'd be willing to trade for the photographs.
Trade. Okay. The photographs... for a straight answer. Who are you? And how do you know Zephram?

Were the two of you... involved?
No... not like you and Doctor Crusher used to be.

How did you know about that?
Ruby... I need to talk to you about those photographs. It's very important.
I'm sure it is. But it'll have to wait until tomorrow.
I'm sure it is. But it'll have to wait until tomorrow.
It can't wait until tomorrow...
It can't wait until tomorrow...
Too bad. Besides, it'll give you all night to think up a new set of lies.
I'd say you already have.
Don't flatter yourself. I take pictures of a lot of junk.
Okay, let's hear it. I'm sure you have a great explanation for why those rocket photos are so important you broke into my house.

Why are you being so difficult? All I'm asking for is to look at one of the photographs. It'll take five minutes.

Data, set a course for that vortex.
Hull integrity down to thirty percent...
Steady as she goes.
Captain, I've found the Borg Sphere. It's on the far side of the planet...firing at the surface.
Intercept course, full impulse. Weapons status?
Intercept course, full impulse. Weapons status?
Phasers are off-line... we have two quantum torpedoes left. But the computer targeting system has been destroyed.

Go to manual.
Target locked!
Fire!
Worf, have Doctor Crusher, Mister La Forge and a security team meet me in Transporter Room Three. Civilian clothes.
Aye, sir.
Incoming transmission from Starfleet Command. Admiral Hayes.
Onscreen.
We're caught in some kind of energy wake from the vortex...
Worf... torpedo... now!
They must've done it in the past... they went back and changed history...
They did it... they assimilated Earth.
Report.
We're still in Earth orbit.
We're still in Earth orbit.
On screen.
Looks like they damaged the silo...
Life signs?
Life signs?
Can't tell. Long-range bio- sensors are off-line.
Captain?
In twenty-four hours, Zephram Cochrane is supposed to conduct the very first warp test... from a missile silo in Montana. If I'm right, the Borg were trying to change the course of human history by killing him or destroying his ship.

And if they succeed, humans won't make First Contact with the Vulcans tomorrow. As First Officer I should be the one beaming down...
And if they succeed, humans won't make First Contact with the Vulcans tomorrow. As First Officer I should be the one beaming down...
Normally, I would agree. But in this case, the mission requires a certain knowledge of 21st century history. You're many things, Number One, but you're not much of an historian.
Good luck, sir.
I'll keep in contact. You have the Bridge.
Return to our own time?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Then make it so. Have you determined how to recreate the temporal vortex?
Yes, sir. But Captain... are we... all going back?
Unless you'd like to stay.
Unless you'd like to stay.
No, sir.
Casualties are light, Captain. Minor buckling on the port nacelle. Nothing serious.
Incoming message from the Starship Intrepid. Admiral Hayes.
I have assigned two damage control teams to locate the source of our communication problems. So far, they've had no success.
Assign another team if you need to. I want to re-establish communication with the Captain as soon as possible.
A ship-wide decompression has been initiated!
What?
What the hell is happening, Worf?
It appears that someone has taken over the Environmental Control Room.
We saw at least thirty...and there are twenty-two Enterprise crewmembers reported missing... including Commander Data.
We'll have to assume they've been assimilated into the Collective.
To control the Enterprise, they'll have to gain access to one of two locations. Main Engineering... or the Bridge.
We have to cover both possibilities. We'll take care of the Bridge. Worf, take your men and seal off Main Engineering. Turn it into a fortress -- nothing gets in.
What are they doing?
They appear to be modifying the deflector dish.
They're re-routing the deflector power conduits...
Computer -- thermal enhancement.
They're connecting the conduits to subspace communications...
They're converting the deflector dish into an antennae...
We have to stop them from sending that message.
Agreed. Options?
Agreed. Options?
Destroy the deflector dish.
You will have to realign the targeting array of the quantum torpedo... and reprogram the warhead for the localized detonation. There's only one torpedo left...
I guess I'd better get it right the first time.
I guess I'd better get it right the first time.
The Borg will undoubtedly attack. Set phasers to rotating modulation.
Are you alright?
Just a little queasy...
Just a little queasy...
Try not to look at the stars... keep your eyes on the ship.
Try not to look at the stars... keep your eyes on the ship.
Right.
Right.
And Commander, whatever you do... do <U>not</U> vomit in your exo-suit. It would be... unpleasant.
And Commander, whatever you do... do <U>not</U> vomit in your exo-suit. It would be... unpleasant.
I'll keep that in mind.
Worf! I'm going to need at least five minutes!
Understood!
Report!
We've lost Bridge control!
We've lost Bridge control!
Emergency override!
Emergency override!
Nothing.
Report.
We just lost main power... and we've got Class-Three alerts all over the ship. I'm not sure what's --
Someone...?
The Borg. Some of them must've beamed over before we destroyed their ship. Seal off that entire deck with emergency force fields.
The Borg. Some of them must've beamed over before we destroyed their ship. Seal off that entire deck with emergency force fields.
Wil... Data was down there.
Wil... Data was down there.
Mister Worf... find Data if you can, but your top priority is isolating the Borg.
All right... we've lost control of eight decks... three Cargo Bays... one Shuttlebay.
Do we have any idea how many Borg we're dealing with?
They're bypassing Engineering...
Where the hell are they going?
To do what? If they wanted a weapon, they could've taken over a phaser bank or torpedo bay...
Deflector dish... why the deflector dish...?
I remember it made me sick.
What are you suggesting?
What are you suggesting?
I think Mister Worf is suggesting that we go outside for a little stroll...
I have to admit there was a moment there when --
Hold that thought.
Worf to Bridge.
Riker here.
Riker here.
There's a dampening field in place on this deck. Our tricorders are useless.
Worf to Bridge. We're about to enter the Environmental Control Room.
Any sign of Data, or the Borg themselves?
Worf? Is something wrong?
Something is very wrong, Commander. We're falling back.
What the hell happened down there, Worf?
Commander... we have a problem.
No response. I'm not reading any Starfleet com traffic in this entire sector.
Captain, I've scanned the planet. The atmosphere contains a high concentration of methane, carbon monoxide and fluorine. The oceans have been chemically altered, as well.
Captain, they're firing at a nuclear missile silo... in central Montana.
Target...
Are we in any danger of being detected by Earth defense systems?
There were no planetary defense systems in this era. Their weapons were designed to fight each other... not extraterrestrials.
Even Data?
Data's positronic net contains classified information on the Enterprise. Command codes, security protocols...
They may be trying to send a message to the other Borg...the Borg in this time period...
What kind of message?
Mr. President.
Admiral Donald...Bill...
Admiral Donald...Bill...
Mr. President we cannot allow Federation citizens to be abducted.
Mr. President we cannot allow Federation citizens to be abducted.
At present I'm awaiting a full report from Enterprise. Pending that I am constrained to observe Interstellar Law.
I'd prefer not to be the President to push the button if I can avoid it.
The longer we wait, the less accessible the hostages will be, Mr. President.
The longer we wait, the less accessible the hostages will be, Mr. President.
I'll bear it in mind, Admiral. I think that's all.
Good luck, Captain.
I'm going too. They may need a doctor.
I believe the operation is over.
The charge is murder.
I'm going to perform surgery on a torpedo - you never know...
You may need assistance, doctor...
You may need assistance, doctor...
Fascinating...
Bet you wish you'd stood in bed...
Vulcans sleep lying down...
Spock, that was actually funny.
We DO sleep lying down.
Calm yourself, doctor, the operation is almost complete...
Thank you, nurse. Jim, she's ready! Lock and load!
Pity they're retiring us just as I was starting to understand you, Spock...
We WERE beginning to hit our stride together, doctor...
Or not to be -
That's the question -
Uh, Jim...
You heard the order, Lieutenant.
What the Hell's going on?
I wish I knew. Uhura?
Sweet Jesus...! He's lost a lot of whatever this stuff is...
Can you - ?
Can you - ?
Jim, I don't even know his anatomy.
No!
Chancellor Gorkon, can you hear me? Chancellor...?
Thanks...
What's the Brotherhood of Aliens?
Figures.
We've been set up all along.
Bones, why don't you see what you can do? Let them know we're not holding a grudge.
Suppose HE'S holding a grudge?
Three months till retirement. What a way to finish.
We're not finished.
We're not finished.
Speak for yourself. One day... one night...
- <U>Kobayashi Maru</U>...
Bones, are you afraid of the future?

No more neutral zone. I was USED to hating Klingons... that's why I failed in our assignment. It never even occurred to me to take Gorkon at his word. Spock was right.

Well, if you've got any bright ideas, now's the time to -
What is it with you, anyway?
Still think we're finished?
Still think we're finished?
More than ever.
What kind of creature is this? Last night you two were spooning -
Don't remind me.
Jim, leave me - I'm finished...
No way. You see this?
It's the viridium patch Spock slapped on my back right before we went aboard Gorkon's ship.
That cunning little Vulcan...
That cunning little Vulcan...
Once we're beyond the shield they should be able to pick it up two sectors away.

Spock's looking for us...
ARE YOU CRAZY?
She didn't need our help getting anywhere... where did she get these convenient clothes? And don't tell me that flare is standard prison issue...
Damned clever if you ask me...
Killed trying to escape - it's a classic...
ABSOLUTELY NOT!
Come on...
Time we got underway ourselves, gentlemen. Once again, we've saved civilization as we know it.
And the good news is they're not going to prosecute.
And the good news is they're not going to prosecute.
To be -
Perhaps with a few small steps at a time. Like this one.
And perhaps with a large step or two. Like a peace treaty.
We're explorers not diplomats!
Starfleet's killed an awful lot of natural phenomena in the name of "exploration"...
Captain, when we get to Camp Khitomer, how will we defend ourselves? I mean, if this new Bird of Prey can fire while she is invisible...?
Now there's a poser.
This is fun...
Captain, shall we attempt to return fire?
Too bad we can't SMELL her.
In space, no one can hear you sweat.
They don't arrest people for having feelings.
If they did we'd all have to turn ourselves in. How CAN we rely on them?
Are you carrying a surgeon?
We were until your torpedoes!
We were until your torpedoes!
Then let me help!
Doctor McCoy, what is your current medical status?
Aside from a touch of arthritis, I'd say pretty good.
For 27 years I have been Ship's Surgeon and later Chief Medical Officer aboard the USS Enterprise. In three months I'm due to stand down.
Stand...?
Stand...?
Retire.
Retire.
Ah. I believe you also consumed Romulan ale at the officers' mess on the night of question, Doctor?
Was Chancellor Gorkon alive when you first examined him?
Barely.
Barely.
Have you saved patients as "barely" alive as he was?
I didn't have the knowledge of Klingon anatomy I needed.
You say you are due for retirement. May I ask: do your hands shake?
I was nervous -
You were incompetent! - whether deliberately or as a result of age combined with drink this court will determine.
You were incompetent! - whether deliberately or as a result of age combined with drink this court will determine.
I tried to save him! I was desperate to save him! He was the last best hope in the universe for real peace.
I tried to save him! I was desperate to save him! He was the last best hope in the universe for real peace.
The Chancellor herself will testify that the defendant's hands shook.
I don't believe we can get more out of the way than this.
They'll make it look like an accident...
They'll make it look like an accident...
What are you in for, if you don't mind me asking?
What are you in for, if you don't mind me asking?
I don't mind. Smuggling. Guilty. I come from Arc. Smuggling is an ancient and respected trade there.
They'll respect him now...
That's a comfort...
It takes a lot of effort.
I don't wonder. Stop me if I'm wrong but do we really have any way of knowing if this is the real you?
I don't wonder. Stop me if I'm wrong but do we really have any way of knowing if this is the real you?
I thought I would assume a pleasing shape. We're outside the shield. Now it's your turn, Kirk.
I've always wanted to meet you, Captain.
I'm not sure how to take that.
Would you care to go topside?
Very much.
"To be or not to be, that is the question" which preoccupies our people, Captain Kirk. We need BREATHING room...
I beg your pardon?
My God, what happened here?
You feign ignorance?
You feign ignorance?
WHAT HAPPENED?
WHAT HAPPENED?
You crippled our gravitational field with a direst torpedo hit, and two Starfleet crewmen beamed aboard in magnetic boots and did this! WE HAVE WITNESSES!
He's a DOCTOR!
How can I trust --
Under article 184 of Interstellar Law, I place you both under arrest. You are charged with assassinating the Chancellor of the High Council.
He just tried to save him!
He just tried to save him!
Take them away.
What?
Isn't it a fact that you served Romulan ale, a beverage illegal in the Federation because of its overwhelming potency?
Isn't it a fact that you served Romulan ale, a beverage illegal in the Federation because of its overwhelming potency?
The drink WAS served...
And you still maintain your ship did not fire on Kronos One? Would you have known if she had? Come now, Captain. The record clearly there were no other ships in the sector.
There... were no other ships in the sector.
There... were no other ships in the sector.
Did you have occasion to refer to your ship's data banks during that night?

I checked the data banks, yes.
I checked the data banks, yes.
And what did they tell you?
And what did they tell you?
That we fired two photon torpedoes. But -
And now we come to the architect of this tragic affair, Captain James Tiberius Kirk. I put it to you, Captain, that you were seeking revenge for the death of your son.
That isn't true...!
That isn't true...!
That, either as an instrument of Federation policy or acting on your own drunken initiative, you and your fellow conspirators crippled KRONOS One and cold-bloodedly assassinated the Chancellor of the High Council. Then you and Doctor McCoy went aboard to make certain the job was complete.
Are those your words?
Yes.
Yes.
Spoken by you?
Spoken by you?
Yes...
Yes...
Louder, please. We cannot hear you.
Louder, please. We cannot hear you.
Those words WERE spoken by me.
You were demoted...
Yes.
Yes.
For insubordination.

I have on occasion disobeyed orders.

I am.
I am.
So if it should prove members of your crew did in fact carry out such an assassination - ?
As Captain I am responsible for the conduct of the crew under my command.
Your honors, the State rests.
Where is Mr. Sulu?
Captain Sulu... on assignment... anyone seen Spock?
Captain, you're not going to show them the bridge??
Full diplomatic courtesy, Mr. Chekov...
Just the size of my head -
I know what you mean...
Torpedo room--?
Uhura, monitor!
Captain, if they fire at us with our shields down --
Torpedo bay! DID we fire those torpedoes?
Get close enough to a man and you can kill him on "Stun" without setting off the alarm - of course you can't get rid of the body...
First rule of assassination: always kill the assassins.
From Starfleet?
Who else?
Where IS the conference?
She's only a cog in the wheel - no way she knows that.
She's here - somewhere.
But if she's cloaked...
But if she's cloaked...
Then all we've got is a neutron radiation surge - and by the time we're close enough to record it, we're ashes...
Shields. Battle stations.
Shields up. Battle stations.
Mr. Chekov, take us forward, thrusters only, one half impulse power...
Aye, sir; thrusters...
Mr. Chekov, slow down. Take us forward, thrusters only, one quarter impulse power.
Aye, sir; thrusters...
Course heading, Captain?
Second star to the right - and straight on till morning...
They're preparing to fire.
Shields up, Captain --?
You're forgetting something. the data banks say WE fired. If we did, the killers are here; if we didn't, whoever altered the data banks is here. Either way, what we're searching for is here...
What ARE we searching for, Mr. Spock?
What ARE we searching for, Mr. Spock?
You tell them, Lieutenant.
Klingon blood.
They must have walked through it when it was floating and tracked it back here.

Now we go to Starfleet?

Now we expand our search to include uniforms.
Now we expand our search to include uniforms.
ALL uniforms?
Mr. Spock, Rura Penthe's deep in Klingon territory. If we're discovered...
Quite right, Mr. Chekov. What is now required is a feat of linguistic legerdemain - and a degree of intrepidity. Before the Captain and Doctor McCoy freeze to death.
You must have cursed yourself, for having programmed our data banks, Lieutenant. Only they revealed something wrong aboard Enterprise.
She programmed the torpedo hits?
Aye, sir.
Mr. Valtane, any more data?
Captain, I'm getting a message from Klingon High Command.
Onscreen.
An INCIDENT?
Do we report this, sir?
Do we report this, sir?
Are you kidding? Send to Starfleet Command...
Send to commander Enterprise: "We stand ready to assist you. Captain Sulu, USS Excelsior." Attach our co-ordinates.
Is that wise, sir? I mean, given their situation - Aye, sir.
This is KRONOS One. I am Chancellor Gorkon.
Chancellor. We've been ordered to escort you through Federation space to your meeting place on Earth.
Chancellor. We've been ordered to escort you through Federation space to your meeting place on Earth.
Thank you, Captain.
Thank you, Captain.
Uh, would you and your party care to dine this evening aboard Enterprise with my officers as guests of the United Federation of Planets?
We'd be delighted to accept your gracious invitation.
We'll make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 1930 hours.
We'll make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 1930 hours.
I shall look forward to it.
Chancellor, may I present Commander Spock, whom I believe you know, Dr. Leonard McCoy, chief medical officer, Montgomery Scott, chief engineer...
Commander, face to face at last.. you have my thanks..
Your research laboratory is most impressive...
Starfleet's been charting and cataloging planetary atmospheres. All vessels are equipped with chemical analytic sensors...
Starfleet's been charting and cataloging planetary atmospheres. All vessels are equipped with chemical analytic sensors...
This cannot be easy for you, Captain... I would feel awkward if I had to give you a tour of OUR vessel...
Thank you, Captain Kirk. The evening has been most... edifying.
We must do this again soon.
I've heard of chameloids - "Shapeshifters" - I thought you were mythical.
Give a girl a chance, Captain.
An accident wasn't good enough...
Good enough for one - two would look suspicious... killed while attempting escape... now that's convincing for both.
Your friends are late...
They'll be here...
Isn't it about time you became something else?
I like it here...
What took you so long?
Kill him! He's the one!!
Kill him! He's the one!!
Not me, idiot - HIM!
He wants your obedience to the Brotherhood of Aliens.
He's got it.
He's got it.
And your coat.
And your coat.
Fraid not. It wouldn't fit him, anyway.
Fraid not. It wouldn't fit him, anyway.
Krandog aranty.
How did you know...?
There's a reward for your death.
We don't get many presidential assassins.
We didn't kill Gorkon.
We didn't kill Gorkon.
Of course not. Anyway, somebody up there wants you out of the way.
How much time's left of your sentence?
Don't you know? Everyone on Rura Penthe is here for life.
That's not his knee. Not everybody keeps their genitals in the same place, Captain.
Anything else you want to tell me?
When whoever it is makes their move, you won't be here to ask if he's the one.
There's gotta be a way out of this place...
Listen. No one has ever escaped from Rura Penthe.
Except us.
Except us.
It IS possible.
I know how to get outside the shield.
Where do we come in?
Where do we come in?
Getting outside the shield is easy. After that it's up to you to get us off the surface before we freeze. Can you?
Getting outside the shield is easy. After that it's up to you to get us off the surface before we freeze. Can you?

I can't make it alone. You're the likeliest candidate to come to this god-forsaken place in months.
I can't make it alone. You're the likeliest candidate to come to this god-forsaken place in months.
Candidate for what?
Maybe if their particles just got a wee bit mixed...
Energize...
Stand down your weapons.
Captain, if --
Captain, if --
Stand DOWN, Mr. Scott. All stop. That's an order.
Stand DOWN, Mr. Scott. All stop. That's an order.
Aye, sir.
This is incredible -
WHO ELSE...?
As you were. Lieutenant...?
Saavik, sir. We were told you'd need a helmsman - ... so I volunteered.
Aft thrusters -

I hope you're happy.
Captain.
Saavik, you know anything about a neutron energy surge?
Sir?
Sir?
Mr. Chekov, anything unusual?
Captain, our shields -- !
Uhura, signal our surrender.
Who is "US?"
I won't allow Starfleet to be dismantled over some Klingon promises.
I won't allow Starfleet to be dismantled over some Klingon promises.

Just the prototype.

This is Captain Sulu, USS Excelsior.
Sulu!

I'm telling you. Hang on. How many of those things are there? Come on, Lieutenant, you're charged with murder...
I'm getting underway now. But you should know, I'm in alpha Quadrant. The chances of my reaching the conference in time are slim.
When does this conference start?

Thank you, Captain Sulu.

Don't mention it, Captain Kirk.
Me?
We have volunteered to rendezvous with the Klingon ship that's bringing Chancellor Gorkon here, and escort him safely through Federation space.
I have personally vouched for you in this matter, Captain.
You have personally -
WE volunteered?

Lieutenant, I am pleased to see you. The Lieutenant is the first Vulcan to be graduated at the top of her class as the Academy.
Congratulations, Lieutenant. That must make you very proud...
Never been this close.
The Chancellor is undoubtedly awaiting our signal.
I believe the Captain feels that Starfleet's mission has always been one of peace -
Far be it for me to dispute my first officer. Starfleet has always -
I don't believe our own conduct will distinguish us in the annals of diplomacy...
I'm going to sleep it off. Let me know if there's some other way we can screw up tonight.
What is it?
I am uncertain.

According to the data bank, we HAVE - twice...
I am responsible for involving you in this. I will go.
I'M going. You are going to be responsible for getting me out of this. Meantime we're not going to be the instigators of a full-scale war on the eve of universal peace.
I'M going. You are going to be responsible for getting me out of this. Meantime we're not going to be the instigators of a full-scale war on the eve of universal peace.
Perhaps you're right.
Captain...
He was just about to explain the whole damn -
The Klingons have a new weapon: a Bird of Prey that can fire while cloaked. She torpedoed Gorkon's ship.
So, that's it..
The peace conference.
What peace conference?
What peace conference?
Azetbur has agreed to meet the Federation at a undisclosed location to continue her father's work... the conspirators obviously intend to try again...
I've been dead before. Uhura, raise Excelsior. She ought to have the co-ordinates.
Why would they give them to us?
Why would they give them to us?
The Commander is an old friend of yours.
Are you dining on worms?
You were right: it was arrogant presumption that got us into this situation. You might have died.

The night is young. Anyway, it was logical. You know, you're a great one for logic. I'm a great one for rushing in where angels fear to tread. We're both extremists. Reality is probably somewhere in between us.
I was blind. I couldn't see past the death of my son. I couldn't trust.
I too was blind. I knew about HER - and I did nothing. I trusted too much.

Gorkon had to die before I understood how prejudiced I was...
Can we two have grown so old and inflexible that we have outlived our usefulness? Would that constitute a joke?
Someone said the difference between comic and cosmic is the letter "S." You haven't outlived your usefulness - to me. And you are not responsible just because she is also Vulcan -

Spock, you want to know something?
Close enough to beam down?
Not yet... Section 4236...
Captain, perhaps we're going about this the wrong way; our job is to get to the conference; HER job will be to stop us.
Make ourselves a target?
What's she waiting for?
Probably trying to figure out why we're reversing, wondering if we detect her.
But we haven't run out of history just yet. Your father quoted Hamlet: he called the future - "the undiscovered country"...
I always assumed Hamlet meant death.
I always assumed Hamlet meant death.
Gorkon thought the undiscovered country might mean something else - another kin of life. People can be very frightened of change. I know I was.
The only way to find out if a man's trustworthy...
... is to trust him.
Control tower, reading, Sir.
Control, this is Enterprise requesting permission to depart.
Channel open, Captain.
This is the Starship Enterprise, Captain James Kirk commanding.
Captain --
WE SURRENDER.
WE SURRENDER.
This is Enterprise. We surrender. Repeat Enterprise surrenders --
It's pretty chaotic over there. There's been some weapons fire and a lot of shouting...
I'm going aboard. Spock, you have the conn.
Gorkon's own man??
Who else?
Uhura?
Nothing, Captain. If they're here, they're rigger for silent running.
Captain, we can't see her, but she gives off heat...
Not from a distance. She won't show up on ANY type of scan.
You have done well, Saavik. As your sponsor at the Academy I have followed your career with... satisfaction. And as a Vulcan.
Sir, I speak to you as a kindred intellect. Do you not recognize that a turning point has been reached in the affairs of the Federation?
Sir, I speak to you as a kindred intellect. Do you not recognize that a turning point has been reached in the affairs of the Federation?
I am not certain such speculations are included among your duties, Lieutenant.
You must have faith.
Faith...?
Faith...?
That the universe will unfold as it should.
But we can't allow them to be taken back to Kronos as prisoners.
What do you suggest, Lieutenant? Opening fire won't retrieve the Captain; and an armed engagement was precisely what he wished to avoid.
How did you - ?
In the meantime we must endeavor to piece together what happened here tonight. According to our data banks, this ship fired those torpedoes.
Her own father...?
Such things have happened before, sir.
Any reply from Starfleet to our dispatch, Lieutenant.
Not as yet, sir.
Not as yet, sir.
Curious. You haven't been assisting Commander Uhura with her radio transmissions, have you, Lt?

A lie?
A lie?
An omission. After that -
Any progress?
We've got a crew of three hundred turning their own quarters inside out, but the killers may be among them. Surely they've disposed of these boots by now. Wouldn't it have been logical to leave them on Gorkon's ship?
We've got a crew of three hundred turning their own quarters inside out, but the killers may be among them. Surely they've disposed of these boots by now. Wouldn't it have been logical to leave them on Gorkon's ship?
Even logic must give way to physics. Gravity hadn't been restored by the time they escaped. Without their boots they would not have stayed on the Klingon transporter pads.
Suppose when they returned they threw the boots into the garbage?
I'm having the garbage searched. If my surmise is correct these boots will cling to the killers' necks like Tiberian bats. They couldn't make their escape without them; nor can they simply throw them out a window for all to see; no - they're here. Somewhere.
A lie?
An error.
If you are logical.
I don't want to.
I don't want to.
I believe you. Please...
But it was when you tried to persuade me the Captain was guilty that I should have understood.
You can't prove any of this...
Perhaps neither of us was hearing very well that night, Lieutenant. There were things I tried to tell you too - about having faith.
You've betrayed the Federation - all of you.
Direct hit -
Confirmed, Captain!
Trouble?
We've been ordered to -

We are experiencing a technical malfunction. All backup systems inoperative.
We can send a message to Starfleet Command -
I do not think so. Enterprise has disobeyed orders and harbors two escaped convicts. Admiral Donald will make certain all your ship-to- shore transmissions are jammed.
Sorry to wake you, sir, but Starfleet urgently requests any data we may have on the whereabouts of Enterprise.
What?
What?
Apparently they're refusing to acknowledge signal to return to spacedock, sir.

According to this we've completed our exploration of the entire sector.

Essential as a resource. Praxis is their key energy production facility. Send to Klingon High Command: "This is Excelsior, a Federation Starship traveling through Beta Quadrant. We have monitored a large explosion in your sector. Do <u>you require assistance</u>?"
I have confirmed the location, sir, but...
What is it?
What is it?
... I cannot confirm the existence of Praxis.
Praxis?
What's left of it.
At least we must keep track of where they are taken, sir. I -
I've already addressed that question, Mr. Scott. We'll e able to follow the Captain's movements.
NO WAY!
Mr. Scott, you forget yourself. Please accompany me.
It's as I said, Mr. Spock: Inventory still registers every torpedo.
Yet the data banks insist we fired: twice. One computer is lying.

And if they're still in place?

Then someone forged a data bank entry.
They don't place the same value on life that we do, Spock - you know that... take my word: she didn't shed one bloody tear...
That's hardly conclusive, Mr. Scott, as Klingons have no tear ducts.
Twenty-four hours from now we won't have a clue where the Captain is.
I know precisely where he'll be.
They dinna fire on themselves. And there were no other ships present.
There was an enormous neutron energy surge.

Not from us!
Too far off. Very near us. Perhaps... underneath us...

I believe I am.

Thank you, Mr. Scott. We were to return to spacedock, the killers would surely manage to dispose of their incriminating footwear.
They're outside the beaming shield. Mr. Scott, start your engines.
Aye, aye, sir.
They're naturally wary, ma'am. We've been at war a long time.
How do both sides overcome ingrained prejudice?
I assume command of this ship as of 0130 hours. Uhura, send to Starfleet HQ. Explain precisely what has taken place, and request instructions.
Yes, sir.
Sulu's giving us his position and telling us he's standing by...
He's placing himself in a most awkward position...
An ancestor of mine maintained that if you eliminate the impossible whatever remains - however improbable - must be the truth.
What exactly does that mean?
What exactly does that mean?
It means that if we cannot have fired those torpedoes then someone else did.
And they'd be right. We have no evidence - just a theory that happens to fit the facts...
Even assuming you're correct, Mr. Spock, why would they fire on their own President?
Even assuming you're correct, Mr. Spock, why would they fire on their own President?
I want this ship searched from bow to stern. Lieutenant Saavik, you are in charge. Start with the transporter room and work your way outwards...
I've pulled out my - uh wooden shoe and Starfleet is screaming for us to return to port.
Mr. Scott, any progress on repairing our warp drive?
You understand that we have lost all contact with Captain Kirk...?
At present, he's surrounded by a magnetic shield. If my calculations are correct, he should be deep into his escape planning by this time.
I don't think Starfleet could have envisioned our current predicament.
Maybe we should write them a letter?
Under impulse power she expends fuel like any other ship. We call it "Plasma" - I do not know the Klingon name for it, but by any name it is merely ionized gas.
Well, what about all that atmospheric equipment we're carrying to catalogue gaseous anomalies?
They might as well arrest me, too; I felt like Lieutenant Saavik.
But you didn't join a conspiracy.
Can you tell me how you came to be on the planet where we found you?
I was taken from my homeworld by people called the "PakJeds." They are fat. They traded me to a ship belonging to the "Bolians." The "Bolians" are blue. They put me in a seat and asked me questions. Then they were attacked by another ship...
Fuzzy face is gone.
Yes, please continue.
Yes, please continue.
I was in space for a long time. Then a ship belonging to the Talosians" picked me up. They asked me where I came from. I told them people called the Pakleds" took me from my homeworld. They are fat
Do you know who I am?
You are me.
You are me.
No. My name is Data... I am your brother.
Do you know where you are?
I am in a room with lights.
Can you remember our father?
No.
Do you know the name of the Captain of this vessel?
No.
No.
Is that your final answer?
Brother. I cannot move.
No, I have only activated your cognitive and communication subroutines.

I notice Dr. Crusher laughing along with the rest of you. As most of you know, the doctor will also soon be leaving the Enterprise, to assume command of Starfleet Medical. Again, I'm forced to ask, Beverly, have you considered what you're doing to little ole me?! I'll probably get some old battle-axe of a doctor who'll tell me to eat my vegetables and
It'll serve you right.
Sort of like losing a son and gaining an empath, isn't it?
Please, Beverly, this is hard enough.
Please, Beverly, this is hard enough.
If you start tearing up I promise to beam you out. Level one medical emergency. Theres no crying in Starfleet.
When was he... created?
About twenty-five years ago. They probably used a hair follicle or skin cell.

I think a skin cells the more likely of the two.
It has the ability to consume organic material at the subatomic level. I can't overestimate the danger of Thalaron radiation, Jean Luc. A microscopic amount could kill every living thing on this ship in a matter of seconds.
Understood. Keep on it. I need to know what he has and how to neutralize any threat. Give me options.
Beverly, come in.
You're working late.
Remember him?
He was a bit proud as I recall.
He was a bit proud as I recall.
He was a damn fool. Selfish and ambitious. Very much in need of seasoning.
He was a damn fool. Selfish and ambitious. Very much in need of seasoning.
He turned out all right.
I so wanted to believe Shinzon. But the Thalaron radiation can't be explained away. Whatever he's after, it's not peace.
Is he very much like you were?
Is he very much like you were?
Yes.
Jean Luc, Whatever you were... Right now you're the man you've made yourself. He's someone else.
I wish I could believe that, Doctor.
Aside from slightly elevated adrenalin and serotonin levels, you're completely normal.
Can you describe it, Deanna?
The more I studied his DNA the more confusing it got. Finally I could only come to one conclusion... Shinzon was created with temporal RNA sequencing. He was designed so that at a certain point his aging process could be accelerated to reach your age more quickly, so he could replace you.
But the Romulans abandoned the plan.
But the Romulans abandoned the plan.
As a result the temporal sequencing was never activated. Remember, he was supposed to replace you at nearly your current age. He was engineered to skip thirty years of life. But since the RNA sequencing was never activated, his cellular structure has started to break down. He's dying.

Dying?
How long does he have?
I can't be sure but the rate of decay seems to be accelerating.
But we do have one advantage. He needs your blood to live. He might come after you first.
I'm counting on it... We've been ordered to head to sector 3274. Starfleet is diverting the fleet to meet us there.
To seek out new life and new civilizations. Zephyr. Cochrans own words. When Charles Darwin set out on the H.M.S. Beagle, on his journey into the unknown... he sailed without a single musket.
That was another time.
That was another time.
How far we've come. Let me know if you need anything.
You can' t imagine them, Jean Luc. They're kids! All with advance degrees in xenobiology and out to conquer every disease in the quadrant.
Reminds me of a young doctor I used to know...

Sir. I noticed an interesting confluence of emotion at the wedding. I am familiar with the human concept of tears through laughter and its inverse, laughter through tears, but I could not help wondering about the human capacity for expressing both pleasure and sadness simultaneously.
I understand why it would seem confusing. Certain human rituals... like weddings, birthdays or funerals evoke strong and very complex emotions. These rites carry great weight with us because they denote the passage of time.

Yes. And, frankly, I envy them as well. They've made important choices; they're going to have great challenges ahead of them. New worlds to conquer...
The choices I made have led me here as well. This is the only home I have ever known. I cannot foresee a reason for leaving.
You never know what's over the horizon, Data. Before too long you'll be offered a command of your own.
If I were... I believe my memory engrams would sense the absence of your specific reactions and behavior. I would "miss you."
Now, you make a toast.

The closest signature is two kilometers to the west... that direction, sir.
Thank you, Data. Let's see what she can do.
The final signature is approx- imately 300 meters up that incline.
Mister Worf, accompany Data please.
He is very observant.
I can see that.
Data!
Sorry, sir.
Starfleet intelligence was only able to provide a partial account of his military record. We can infer he is relatively young and a capablecommander. He fought seventeen major engagements in the war. All successful. Beyond that, we know nothing.
Well... it seems we're truly sailing into the unknown. Keep at it. Anything you can give me would be appreciated. Dismissed.
Data to Captain Picard. Geordi and I have identified the source of the unauthorized computer access. And, I believe, we have also discovered an opportunity to gain a tactical advantage.
On my way.
My mission was a success, sir. I have discovered the source of the Thalaron radiation.
Good work. The download?
Good work. The download?
He believes he has our communications protocols. But they will give him inaccurate locations for all Starfleet vessels.
A bit less florid, Data.
Aye, sir... This way.
A weapon.
It would appear so.
Geordi equipped me with the prototype for the Emergency Transport Unit. I recommend you use it to return to the Enterprise.
It'll only work for one of us.
It'll only work for one of us.
Yes, sir.

While I find that fascinating, Data, we really need that Goddamned door open!
What do you imagine this is?
Port thrusters, sir. Would you like me to drive?
Can you open the shuttlebay doors?
Affirmative, sir. Negative, sir. They have instigated security overrides and erected a force field around the external portals.

How many of you did Dr. Soong make?
I thought only me, myself and Lore.
Isolated pockets of humanoids. It appears to be a pre-warp civilization at an early stage of industrial development.
Captain, I don't recommend transporting, that ion storm doesn't look very neighborly. -It could head this way with- out much warning .
Well, he seems to have the same internal mechanics as Data but not as much positronic develop- ment. The neural pathways aren't nearly as sophisticated. Id say he's a prototype. Something Dr. Soong created before Data .
Do you have a name, sir?
At present he serves no useful function. Dr. Soong created us to become active and useful members of society. I do not believe he would have wanted the B-9 to live out his life in his present state.
I can't believe the Captain went along with a memory download.

It appears to be... ... an arm.
Why is it moving?

No.
I would like to pick you up now. May I do that?

Of course, sit down.
It's about Data I've watched him with the B-9 and I'm troubled. Data's desire for a "family" is very strong. I'm afraid he may be investing too much in the B-9.
You're speaking of emotional investment?
You're speaking of emotional investment?
The B-9 is like a slow child, sir. And Data, in his own way, has assumed the position of a parent or guardian. I'm afraid he has expectations based on his own experiences. He'll be disappointed when the BI-9 cannot meet those expectations.

I would say he's been trained to resist telepathy. What I could sense of his emotions were erratic, very hard to follow.
Is he sincere about wanting peace?
Is he sincere about wanting peace?
I don't know.
Sir, the strongest sense I had was that he's more than urious about you. He very much wants to know you. The same way you want to know him.
How could I not?
How could I not?
Captain, don't assume he's anything like you are. You should resist the urge to think you know him.
Captain, don't assume he's anything like you are. You should resist the urge to think you know him.
I not only know him, Deanna, I am him.. and he is me!
Shinzon's Viceroy seems to have the ability to reach into my thoughts. I've become a liability... I request to be relieved of my duties.
Permission denied. If you can possibly endure any more of these assaults. I need you at my side. Now more than ever I...
How can you be certain?
I know how he thinks.
Captain -- I might have a way to find them.
Counselor?
Counselor?
The one thing he may have forgotten in the course of battle: me.
The one thing he may have forgotten in the course of battle: me.
Make it so.
But how can he? He'll kill you.
This isn't about me anymore.
I'm only half human.
Deanna Troi of Betazed. Empathic and telepathic abilities, ship's counselor. All of this I knew... But I didn't know you were so beautiful.
Imzadi. This is so good.
No!
He can never know you as I know you... He can never touch you as I touch you.
This isn't real.
This isn't real.
Can you feel my hands... are they real? Can you feel my lips, my loins?
I'll always be with you now. Now and forever.
You sick bastard!
You're not here.
Very logical, Deanna... But your heart doesn't constrain itself to mere logic. To leave all of this behind and be with me.
No.
I can feel your desire, Deanna.
Captain Picard, Commander Donatra of the Warbird Valdore. Might we be of assistance?
Your timing is impeccable, Commander.
Your timing is impeccable, Commander.
The Empire considers this a matter of internal security. We regret you've become involved.

When this is over, I owe you a drink.
I'm afraid that drink will have to wait, Captain.
Do you have life support?
Do you have life support?


Understood.
Open a channel.
This is Commander Donatra of the Valdore. We're dispatching shuttles with medical personnel and supplies.

Thank you, Commander.
It's very faint but I've isolated it to the third planet in the Kolarin system.
What do we know about the planet?
What do we know about the planet?
Uncharted. We'll have to get closer for a more detailed scan.
Uncharted. We'll have to get closer for a more detailed scan.
Theories?
I read six distinct positronic signatures, spread out over a few kilometers on the surface.
What do we know about the population?
Cannon fodder.
Then how did a Reman get to be Praetor? I don't get it.
It's going to take some time to find out -- the data stream was rerouted through substations all over the ship.
What programs were accessed?
What programs were accessed?
That's what I don't get -- it's mostly basic stellar cartography: star charts; communications protocols; some uplinks from colony tracking stations. It's not even restricted material.

Set up a security program to detect any unusual data stream rerouting. If it happens again, we want to be ready.

There's something else. I was reviewing the sensor logs.
I thought Thalaron radiation was theoretical.
Which is why our initial scans didn't pick it up. But he's got it, Captain.
Which is why our initial scans didn't pick it up. But he's got it, Captain.
As I remember, Thalaron research was banned in the Federation because of its bioqenic properties.
It's called a Cascading Bio- genic Pulse. The unique properties of Thalaron radiation allow the energy beam to expand almost without limits. Depending on the radiant intensity it could encompass a ship... or a planet.
And that's exactly what he's going to do.
He's getting his cloak back. We have exhausted our compliment of photon torpedoes. Phaser banks are down to four percent.
What if we target all phasers in a concentrated attack?
What's he doing?
He wants to look me in the eye.
He thinks he knows exactly what I'm going to do.
Sir?
Sir?
Weve got him!
Geordi, put 211 power to the engines. Take it from life support if you have to -- everything you can give me.
Aye, sir.
Aye, sir.
Deanna, on my mark.
Deanna, on my mark.
Ready, sir!
How long until he can fire?
The targeting sequence should take about four minutes.
Prepare for a site-to-site transport.
Sir, we wont be able to bring you back. Its a one way trip. Captain, I don't know if the transporter...
Sir, we wont be able to bring you back. Its a one way trip. Captain, I don't know if the transporter...
That's an order, Commander.
You have the bridge, Commander. Use all available power to move away from the Scimitar. Now, Mister La Forge.
Aye, sir.
Sir, we're being hailed.
On screen.
Geordi... prepare the shuttle- bay for arrivals. They don't know our procedures so just... open the doors.
I'll take care of it, sir.
I'll take care of it, sir.
Number One. You have the bridge.
Admiral Janeway. Good to see you.


With or without the rest of the fleet?
With or without the rest of the fleet?
A diplomatic mission. We've been invited, believe it or not. Seems there's been some kind of internal political shakeup. The new Praetor, someone called Shinzon, has requested a Federation envoy.

New Praetor?
New Praetor?
There's more... as always. He's Reman.
Believe me, we don't under- stand it either. You're the closest ship so I want you to high tail it over there and hear what he has to say. Get the lay of the land, If the Empire becomes unstable, it could mean trouble for the entire quadrant.
Understood.
Understood.


Not with the Romulans.
Not with the Romulans.


Just lucky, Admiral.
Just lucky, Admiral.
Let's hope that luck holds. Janeway out.
Enterprise. We are the Reman Warbird Scimitar.
Praetor Shinzon, I'm pleased to...
Praetor Shinzon, I'm pleased to...
I am not Shinzon. I am his Viceroy. We are sending transport coordinates.
So, human... you've met your better self!
What are you doing to Counsellor Troi?

I'm preparing her for Shinzon. To sooth him as she soothes you. To stand at his side as she does at yours.

Listen to him, android. Such a small and weak creature. Yet he roars so valiantly...
It would take me but an instant to tear that valiant heart from your chest.
There'll be another after me. And another after that. You'll find we're a resilient species.
There'll be another after me. And another after that. You'll find we're a resilient species.
I look forward to the sport. Take him.
I won't do it.
Wont do what, Mister Worf?

Captain. I think it is inappropriate for a Starfleet officer to appear... Naked.
Captain. I think it is inappropriate for a Starfleet officer to appear... Naked.
Come now, a big, strapping fellow like you? What are you afraid of?
I'm picking up an unusual electromagnetic signature from the Kolarin system.
What sort of signature?
To find the head, sir?
If you don't mind.
Sir, I recommend we raise shields.
Not yet, Mister Worf.
No!
Captain!
Captain!
Tactical analysis, Mister Worf.
Tactical analysis, Mister Worf.
Fifty-two disruptor banks, twenty-seven photon torpedo bays, primary and secondary phased shields.
We're being hailed.
On screen.
Sir, we've had an unauthorized access into the main computer.
Who was it?
Worf, prepare a full phaser spread, zero elevation. All banks on my mark. Scan for shield impacts and stand by photon torpedoes.
Aye, sir
Sir, we're being hailed.
On screen.
Coordinate our attack with the Valdore's tactical officer. Triangulate fire on any shield impacts.
Aye, sir.
Captain, the Hemingway has arrived to tow us to spacedock.
On my way. Please notify Commander Riker.
What's this?
Your new chair, sir.
Diverting to the Kolarin system takes us awfully close to the Romulan Neutral Zone.
Still well on our side...
I think it's worth a look. Don't worry, Number One, we'll get you to Betazed with time to spare.
Thank you, sir...
Thank you, sir...
Where we will all honor the Betazoid traditions. No cold feet, or any other parts of our anatomy. Now, if youll excuse me. Ill be in the gym.
Captain, I hope I don't have to remind you --
I appreciate your concern, Number One, but I've been itching to try out the Argo.
I appreciate your concern, Number One, but I've been itching to try out the Argo.
Sir --
Sir --
Captain's prerogative, Will. There's no foreseeable danger... and your wife would never forgive me if anything happened to you.
Captain, you have an Alpha Priority communication from Starfleet Command.
Acknowledged ... ...I'll talk to Data.
We have to assume he had Romulan collaborators.
A coup d'etat?
A coup d'etat?
The Praetor's power has always been the Romulan fleet. They must be behind him.
Why don't they answer our hails?
It's an old psychological strategy, Number One. To put him in a position of dominance and make us uneasy.

It's working.
It's working.
Counselor?
Captain, with all due respect to diplomatic protocols -- the Federation Council's not sitting out here, we are.
Patience. Diplomacy is a very exacting occupation. We can wait.
She's not out for a pleasure cruise.
She's a predator.
Not very chatty.
Away team. Transporter room four.
He wasn't designed to live a complete, human life span.
Can anything be done for him?
Sir?
His hatred of the Federation is apparent. He would have built a weapon of that scope for one reason. He is going after Earth.

Oh boy. Destroy humanity and the Federation is crippled.
Oh boy. Destroy humanity and the Federation is crippled.
And the Romulans invade.
Strength in numbers?
We can only hope so.
Report.
He's firing through his cloak. We can't get a lock.
Counselor Troi, report to the bridge.
Unless we can disable his cloak we're just going to be firing in the dark.
Unless we can disable his cloak we're just going to be firing in the dark.
Agreed.
The Titan's a fine ship, will. And she's getting a captain worthy of her.
She's the most beautiful ship Ive ever seen.
But she's not the Enterprise.
I promise you in time, she'll become your home ...If I could offer you one piece of advice?
I promise you in time, she'll become your home ...If I could offer you one piece of advice?
Anything.
Anything.
When your first officer insists that you can't go on away missions... Ignore him.
When your first officer insists that you can't go on away missions... Ignore him.
I intend to.
Serving with you has been an honor.
The honor was mine. Captain Riker.
I hope you'll forgive the darkness... we're not comfortable in the light.
Praetor Shinzon?
And you're not as we imagined you.
No?
Praetor?
I've never met a human woman.
I am, Commander Riker... May I touch your hair?
Praetor, we've come to Romulus on a matter we were -- assured was of great importance. If you have anything to say to us as representatives of the Federation, I suggest you do so now.
On the world I come from there's no light. No sun. Beauty isn't important. I see now there's a world elsewhere.
Praetor Shinzon. Were not here to discuss your lack of a social life.
Praetor Shinzon. Were not here to discuss your lack of a social life.
Yes, I'm sorry, Captain. There's so much we have to talk about.
Yes, I'm sorry, Captain. There's so much we have to talk about.
I would be interested to know what we are talking about.
I would be interested to know what we are talking about.
Unity, Captain! Tearing down the walls between us to recognize we are one people. Federation and Romulan. Human and Vulcan and Klingon and Reman. I'm speaking of the thing that makes us the same. We want peace.
I want to end the centuries of mistrust. I want to be your ally, not your enemy. As a first step I propose we eliminate the Neutral Zone and begin a free and open exchange of goods and ideas.
And the Senate supports you?
And the Senate supports you?
I have dissolved the Senate.
Right now, youre thinking this all sounds too good to be true?
Yes.
Yes.
And you're wondering why the Scimitar is so well armed. Is this the ship of a peacemaker? Or a predator?.
But you're also thinking the chance for peace is too promising to ignore. Above allyou're trying to decide if you can trust me.
Yes.
Yes.
Then perhaps the time has come to add some illumination to our discussion. Computer, raise lighting four levels.
No one knew what to do. Finally I was taken to a doctor who had some experience with Terran illnesses and I was finally diagnosed with Shalaft's syndrome. Do you know of it, Captain?
You know I do.
We need to talk, just you and I.
Come to dinner on Romulus tomorrow. Just the two of us. Or just the one of us.
Come to dinner on Romulus tomorrow. Just the two of us. Or just the one of us.
You know I need to verify this.
You know I need to verify this.
I know.
And when I was ready they were going to replace you with me, an exact biological duplicate. Put a Romulan agent at the heart of Starfleet to.influence your command structure. It was a bold plan.
What happened?
What happened?
As happens so frequently here on Romulus, a new government came to power. They decided to abandon the plan -- frankly, I think they were afraid I'd be discovered and it would lead to war. They weren't ready for that.
Romulan ale -- I'm surprised. I can't stand it.
You'll acquire a taste for it.
It's not quite the face you remember.
Not quite. I envy the hair- line.
Not quite. I envy the hair- line.
A lifetime of violence will do that. My nose was broken four times. And my jaw... But so much is the same. The eyes, you recognize the eyes.

How did you end up on Remus?
How did you end up on Remus?
They sent me there to die. How could a mere human survive the dilithium mines? It was... I was a slave. And a monster. The only thing the Romulan guards hated more than the Remans was me. But one man took pity on me: the man who became my Viceroy. He taught me how to survive. And in that dark place, where there was
For thousands of years the Romulan Senate has met in this chamber and dictated the fate of its sister-planet... But the time has come for us to live as equals.
You're doing this to liberate the Remans?

No race should be a slave to another.
You don't trust me.
I have no reason to.

Of course you do. If you had lived my life and experienced the suffering of my people... youd be sitting where I am now. At least I hope you would.
Of course you do. If you had lived my life and experienced the suffering of my people... youd be sitting where I am now. At least I hope you would.
And if you had lived my life you would understand that there is a great respons- ibility in representing the Federation. I can't let my personal feelings unduly influence my decisions.

All I have is my personal feelings. I wasn't raised with the ideals of the Federation. But I'm trying to understand them now. To live up to them. To live up to you.
I want to know where I come from. The Remans gave me a future. You can tell me about my past.
There's so much, and so much of it is dull...

Age before rank, Jean Luc.
So I'm not as tall as you expected?
I always hoped I would hit two meters.
I always hoped I would hit two meters.
With a full head of hair.
With a full head of hair.
There is that.
Shinzon... I'm trying to believe you.
I know.
I know.
If there's one ideal the Federation holds most dear it's that all men, all races, can be united. From the first time the Vulcans came to Earth we've sought a future of peace. Nothing would make me more proud than to take your hand in friend- ship. In time. When trust has been earned.

I'm honored to think I might someday speak with such eloquence.
In time, Jean Luc.
In time.
Hello, Jean Luc.
Why am I here?
Why am I here?
I was lonely...
What are you doing?
I need a sample of your blood. What do your Borg friends say? Resistance is futile.
All of this so you could capture me?
Don't be so vain. After we found it, we made a few modifications. An extra memory port, a hidden transponder. Perhaps your eyes will be a bit less confident when you learn I've gained access to Starfleet's communications protocols. I now know the location of your entire fleet ... You may go.
Maybe I'll train it to do little tricks for me like your robot does. Or maybe Ill snap its ugly head off.
What's this all about?
What's this all about?
It's about destiny, Picard. About a Reman outcast who...
It's about destiny, Picard. About a Reman outcast who...

If your issues are with me... This has nothing to do with my ship and nothing to do with the Federation.
If your issues are with me... This has nothing to do with my ship and nothing to do with the Federation.
Oh, but it does. We will no longer bow like slaves before anyone. Not the Romulans and not your mighty Federation. We're a race bred for war. For conquest.

Think about what you're doing, Shinzon. Are you ready to plunge the entire quadrant into war to satisfy your own personal demons?

It amazes me how little you know yourself.

I'm incapable of such an act, and so are you.
I'm incapable of such an act, and so are you.
I think the facts speak for themselves. The same noble Picard blood runs in our veins. Had you lived my life, you'd be doing exactly as I am. Look in the mirror, and see yourself.
You can't trace my holographic emitters, Captainn. So don't bother. And you can't contact Starfleet. We're quite alone.
We are.
We are.
It's just the two of us now, Jean Luc, as it should be... Your ship and mine... You and me.
It's just the two of us now, Jean Luc, as it should be... Your ship and mine... You and me.
Why are you here?
Why are you here?
To accept your surrender. I can clearly destroy you at any time. Lower your shields and allow me to transport you to my ship.

I know... you'll all gladly die to save your home world.
Look at me, Shinzon! Do you feel the blood pumping inside you? Your hands, your eyes, your nature, are the same as mine. Buried deep inside you beneath the years of pain and anger is a capacity you've forgotten. It's the one way our mirror can reflect the two of us exactly because it's the very thing that truly defines us. To be human
I know you as well as I know myself, Shinzon. There was a time you looked at the stars and dreamed of what might be.
Long ago.
Long ago.
Not so long.
Not so long.
Childish dreams, Captain. Lost in the dilithium mines of Remus. I'm what you see now.
Childish dreams, Captain. Lost in the dilithium mines of Remus. I'm what you see now.
I see more than what you are.
The man who is Jean Luc Picard and Shinzon of Remus won't exterminate the population of an entire planet! He is better than that!
He is what his life has made him!
Yes.
So if I gave you my life, what would you do with it? Would you spend the years in a blaze of hatred as you are now? Or could you change? Could you try to remember a mother's touch you never felt? A father's words you never heard? Could you do that?

I don't know.
I don't know.
But you want to.
That's your life... not mine.
Please.
Please.
Its too late.
Its too late.
You can still make a choice! Make the right one now!
You can still make a choice! Make the right one now!
I have no choices! I can't fight what I am!
I hope you're still alive, Jean Luc.
I am.
I am.
Don't you think it's time to surrender? I'll have my cloak back in a matter of minutes and your poor ship is shot to pieces. Why should the rest of your crew have to die?
Praetor, we've received the transponder signal.
On my way.
Report!
Two ships decloaking, sir! Romulan!
Target disruptors. Destroy them.
Disruptors are off-line, sir.
Deploy the weapon. Kill everything on that ship. Then set a course for Earth.
What about Picard?
What about Picard?
Our greater goal is more important, brother.
Our greater goal is more important, brother.
But, Praetor, you won't survive without him...
Well, that sounds relaxing too.
It is... invigorating.
So theyve got him up and running.
He's a very unusual android.
He's a very unusual android.
Runs in the family.
My God...
Should I raise shields?
Minimal damage to the Scimitar.
Defensive pattern Kirk Epsilon. Geordi, get those shields online.
Believe it or not, I think the cavalry has arrived.
We're being hailed.
Intruder alert!
Let's go.
Are we prepared?
Yes, Praetor.
This is a mistake.
He's gentler than I thought. And he has a sense of humor.
He's gentler than I thought. And he has a sense of humor.
Don't forget our mission, Shinzon. We should act. Now. Time is running out.
Don't forget our mission, Shinzon. We should act. Now. Time is running out.
My time. I'll spend it how I choose.
The bond is broken.
Find her again.
Find her again.
No -- this is wasting time.
No -- this is wasting time.
Do as I tell you!
It's accelerating. You have no more time for games.
Have the doctors prepare. I'll be on the bridge.'
How long?
A matter of hours now.
How long until we reach the Rift?
Seven minutes.
Let her pursue -- drop cloak on the aft port quadrant and prepare for full emergency stop.
What?!
What?!
You heard me.
Praetor...
FULL STOP AND FIRE !
What is it?!! Focus on your job!!
She is here.
Join us, Commanders. Now what's the disposition of the fleet?
They're holding position.
They're holding position.
And?
And?
They will obey, Praetor.
They will obey, Praetor.
It's imperative we retain their allegiance or our great mission will be strangled before it can truly draw breath.
How many Warbirds will you need?
None.
Praetor. You have the whole fleet at your disposal. They supported the coup, they'll follow you.
The Scimitar will serve my needs.
The Scimitar will serve my needs.
But surely...
But surely...
I came this far alone ...
Then I don't understand the reason for the delay!
You don't have to understand.
You don't have to understand.
And bringing the Enterprise here?! What possible purpose could that serve?
And bringing the Enterprise here?! What possible purpose could that serve?
I have a purpose.
I have a purpose.
Then perhaps you will enlight- en us?
Then perhaps you will enlight- en us?
Silence, Romulan!
You must learn patience, Commander. Do you know where I learned it? In the dilithium mines of Remus. Spend eighteen hours every day under the ash of a Romulan guards whip and you'll soon understand patience.
Praetor.
Praetor.
Now go. I have some personal business.
The Enterprise is immaterial! They won't make it back to Federation space.


I thought we discussed patience, Commander.
I thought we discussed patience, Commander.
And mine is wearing thin, young man! We supported you because you promised action. And yet you delay and you waste your time playing games with Picard while--
Commander Suran, the games are over. In two days the Federation will be crippled beyond repair. Does that satisfy you?
For the moment.
For the moment.
And when I return... you and I shall have a little talk about showing proper respect!
Benny, God, take it easy...
I don't want to scare them away.
Right in line with that burning tree.
I don't see anything.
I don't see anything.
It's there. The fog's thicker now, but it's there. What do you think started those fires?
Benny, there's nothing there.
There is. They came out of the belly of the ship and then went to the first terrace and flew down into the houses.
There is. They came out of the belly of the ship and then went to the first terrace and flew down into the houses.
Flew?! Oh, come on Benny...
What did I tell you?
Probably kids.
Don't you think you should call a backup?
No, we can handle this.
Mike, call for back-up. Benny, you all right?
I don't think so...
I don't think so...
Benny, this is me. I'm going to take a look.
Gate three. It's boarding now.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Have a nice trip.
What can I do for you folks?
How much are your rooms?
How much are your rooms?
Thirty-seven fifty for one person, forty-nine fifty for two.
You have one with two beds?
Sure.
Sure.
I'll take that.
I'll take that.
Fill this out. Will this be cash or credit card?

We're only going to be here a few hours...
It's still the full price.
Do you have a good map of Death Valley?
We should have. Let me see.
Food. Eat. I prepare food. I work as a cook. That's how I make money.
I understand.
I understand.
What do you do?

I make maps.
I make maps.
Hey, that sounds interesting. You like it?
Hey, that sounds interesting. You like it?
Eh... yes.
Eh... yes.
Make any money?
Make any money?
No.
No.
You don't get rich as a cook, either, believe me. I got a girl going to college this fall. The wife had to go back to nursing to help pay for it.
Do you have children?
No.
No.
They're damned expensive and a pain in the ass sometimes, but I wouldn't trade having them for anything.
What do you think of America?
It is beautiful.
Well, here we are... You go down that ramp there, you're sure to get a ride.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And don't be shy about your English. You speak better than a lot of people I know. Take care of yourself.
No!!! No!!!
He's got a gun!!

Elmo's...
Elmo's...
Where's that?
Where's that?
About five miles back.
We're going... Damn! We'll tell the press that there was an accident. Chemical warfare spill. That cover cannot be violated in any way. Understand me, Shermin?
Major Bell here, sir. We have to tell these people that we're friendly. That this whole thing was a mistake. Is anyone trying to contact the ship?
Major Bell here, sir. We have to tell these people that we're friendly. That this whole thing was a mistake. Is anyone trying to contact the ship?
Shermin, I want you and Bell to start looking for the one on the ground.
Recognize this?
It's a copy of the plaque NASA sent into space on the Pioneer probes.

It's real, George.
There's no mistake? You're absolutely sure?

Get the body out of there. Load it on the Air Force chopper and get it to Wright Patterson. They'll take it from there... We didn't expect this, Shermin.
Get the body out of there. Load it on the Air Force chopper and get it to Wright Patterson. They'll take it from there... We didn't expect this, Shermin.
Neither did I.
We'll need a lot of help, George. You could hide an army up here.
I'm going to the White House right now. I'll try and get you everything you need.
I'm going to the White House right now. I'll try and get you everything you need.
Wait, wait... What are my orders if we find this thing?
Contain it and get back to me.
What do you mean by 'contain?'
Then it's not an accident that they found us.
We don't think that's necessarily bad. At least it's a point of contact.
We don't think that's necessarily bad. At least it's a point of contact.
Not necessarily bad! If they knew we were here why didn't they let us know they were coming?

We'll get those answers when you find the one you're looking for.
We'll get those answers when you find the one you're looking for.
That's not going to happen, George, unless you get us the help you promised us.
That's not going to happen, George, unless you get us the help you promised us.
We've been back and forth on this all day and keeping in mind the panic that would occur if this got to the general public, it's been decided not to expand the search at this time.

Don't let them do it this way, George. It's too important. We can't find this thing alone.
Don't let them do it this way, George. It's too important. We can't find this thing alone.
You have to. We're trying to contact the ship. If we do, I'll let you know immediately. Good luck.
George, we've just confirmed the existence of the live extraterrestrial.
When can we expect containment?
When can we expect containment?
Well, we're in pursuit of a green Mustang...
Well, we're in pursuit of a green Mustang...
It's in a green Mustang?
It's in a green Mustang?
Yes. It's kidnapped a woman at gunpoint and from what we can make out is forcing her to drive it somewhere.
Why did you let it get into a populated area?
It's taken on a disguise.
It's taken on a disguise.
Clarify that.
Clarify that.
It's made itself look like the woman's dead husband.
The extraterrestrial now looks like this.
Oh shit!!!
You sure you want this, because... that's putting an awful lot of faith in people we have no control over...
I'm afraid the situation demands that kind of risk.
I'm afraid the situation demands that kind of risk.
I don't like it, George...

Dammit Shermin. Earlier you were asking for help. What's changed?

You'll get results one way or the other, that's for sure... Okay.
I'm gonna be here if you need anything.
We're growing very concerned back here. There's no use pretending otherwise. We're rapidly approaching a 'condition red.' People are beginning to ask difficult questions.
I'll make this as simple as I can, George. They disappeared.

I don't care where you're from you just can't disappear into thin air.

George, listen to what you're saying. This thing's changed itself into a man. Disappearing may not be that big a deal.
George, listen to what you're saying. This thing's changed itself into a man. Disappearing may not be that big a deal.
So far you've let it cross the heart of America. For two days it has been absorbing information that is detrimental to our security. I don't see the humor in that.
Maybe... look, this is just something to think about... from what I got at the shopping center, it was more scared than anything else... I don't feel it's as big a threat as you think it is...
Is that what's affecting your performance?
Is that what's affecting your performance?
I'm not being unpatriotic, and I'm doing my damndest to catch them. Bell's up on 80 and I'm down here on 70 past Grand Junction. They're heading west. If they're not flying we have a damn good chance of getting them. All I'm asking is that you people think about it.

You're not hearing me.
You're not hearing me.
You can change a directive, George. You've done it before. Listen to me. He's going somewhere in Death Valley. Lathrop Wells was never anything but a bus stop. East is the nuclear site. There are no roads in there. She was teaching him to hitchhike. I'm telling you. We block the four roads into Death Valley and we got him.

You've been through quite an ordeal, Mrs. Haydn. Why don't you stay where you are and let us pick you up? We'll fly you home.

Is the man who kidnapped you there now?
I told you. He let me go. I'm on my way home.

But I must go here.
I know that. But the buses don't go there.
I know that. But the buses don't go there.
What is hitchhike?
What is hitchhike?
That's easy. I'll explain that in a minute. This is your ticket. When you get on the bus here, the driver will take this part. You will ride to Omaha. When you get to Omaha, ask the driver. 'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.'
Say it.
'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.'
'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.'
The driver will...
The driver will...
But I speak English.

Will you please do it my way? You'll get into trouble if you don't. If anybody talks to you, tell them... I do not speak English.

You want this ticket?
You want this ticket?
Yes.
Yes.
Then don't be smart.
'Lathrop Wells, please. I do not speak English.'
You keep this. Now this is hitch- hike... You stand on the side of the road, the highway... you understand? And you face the cars going in the direction you want to go. When you see a car or a truck coming, you stick out your thumb like this...
Your thumb tells the driver that you want a ride.
The car will stop?
The car will stop?
Not every car, but... a car will stop... Maybe not the first car... maybe number eight, number fifteen...
When do I get to Lathrop Wells?
Tomorrow morning. Start hitch-hiking right away and...
Don't worry. They're not going to hurt you. Come on. Only show this to the driver. Nobody else. And don't lose it.
Can I have the gun?
Can I have the gun?
No.
Don't be afraid. Do what I told you and you'll be okay.

Why did your ship land on this planet... on Earth?
It was a mistake.
You thought we were a different planet?!
No. My ship was doing a map of all the suns and...

Stars... When a sun is far away, we call it a 'star.'
We were doing a map of the stars and all the other things up there when we saw a small ship. My... eh... we kidnapped it. On it there was a map that said how to come to Earth. This was very important. Before then, we thought we were the only people in all the stars.

You did? That's funny. So did we.
You did? That's funny. So did we.
Yes?
Yes?

We told our home, and the people who tell us what to do on my planet said to come and look but not to talk, not to land, not to shoot. Just to look from up there. We came and... the driver of my ship...

The police shouldn't have started shooting. But you can hardly blame them. You surprised them. They didn't know you were up there. When they saw you, they thought you were here to hurt us.

You liked my singing?

I'm not sleepy anymore. Let's drive for a little while longer.
Are you angry at me?
No. I'm just not tired. Let's go.
I told you goodbye. Why are you here?
The police are waiting for you up ahead. There's a roadblock. You have to go back.

If I don't meet the ship, my people will go home without me.
Please understand. If you go this way, you'll never get to your ship. The police know about Lathrop Wells. We have to go another way. I'll get you to your ship. I promise.

What are you saying?
You can stop. I will go on alone.
You can stop. I will go on alone.
We're too far away to walk. Don't you understand?
Why don't you send one of your radio balloons and tell your captain that you might be late?
I used the last one to jump off the cliff...

Let's find a place out of the rain. I'm sure we'll get a ride in the morning.
Let's find a place out of the rain. I'm sure we'll get a ride in the morning.
I can't be late. I don't know if the radio balloons work above your planet. I don't know if my words went to the ship. If I'm not there, the captain will think I'm dead and go.

We'll get a ride in the morning.
You are cold.
You're damn right I am.
You're damn right I am.
I do not get cold.
What?
Nothing.
Good morning.
Horses.
Horses.
You don't forget anything, do you?
You don't forget anything, do you?
No.
Hello... hello. How are you this morning?
Do they talk?!
Do they talk?!
No, they don't talk... We talk to them.
No, they don't talk... We talk to them.
I understand.
Oh, you're pretty...
I gave you a baby last night.
They are beautiful.
Yes, they are.
Yes, they are.
You have been very good to me, Jennyhaydn. You said you wanted a baby, so I gave you one.
You have been very good to me, Jennyhaydn. You said you wanted a baby, so I gave you one.
But...
But...
It will be human and it will look like this. But when it comes it will know everything I know and everything you know. That is something from my planet that I want your baby to have.
It will be human and it will look like this. But when it comes it will know everything I know and everything you know. That is something from my planet that I want your baby to have.
I told you it's impossible for me to have a baby.
I told you it's impossible for me to have a baby.
You will have this baby. If you want it. If you don't, I can stop it now.
The cowboys were right. You can make money fast gambling.
You don't make money gambling. You lose it.
May I have twenty-five cents, please?
What for?
What for?
I want to gamble.
Here are two quarters. When you lose these, you're not going to get anymore.
I understand. Thank you.
This is crazy. We don't have time for this.
I know how to gamble now.
I know how to gamble now.
You won ten dollars. Big deal. If we don't get a good ride before dark we could miss your ship.
You won ten dollars. Big deal. If we don't get a good ride before dark we could miss your ship.
I want to get money for you and the baby.
I want to get money for you and the baby.
I don't need any money for the baby. I'll be fine.
I don't need any money for the baby. I'll be fine.
Inflation, tuition, college. Children are damned expensive. I know.
Inflation, tuition, college. Children are damned expensive. I know.
The cook again?
The cook again?
Yes.
Yes.
If I ever run into that guy, I'm going to kick his ass.
It'll tell you pretty much everything about us...
This is very interesting. We are born knowing our history. We have other books. But not a book like this.

Any words you don't know you can find in the dictionary.
Any words you don't know you can find in the dictionary.
I understand.
I understand.
It'll give you the different countries, how they came to be, what they are now, how America came to be, the governments, the languages... everything.
It'll give you the different countries, how they came to be, what they are now, how America came to be, the governments, the languages... everything.
Many of my people will not believe those things are possible. On my planet there is only one government, one people, one language. I will be asked a lot of questions.

What will you say about us?
What will you say about us?
I will say that we can be friends.
I will say that we can be friends.
We can.
This is yours...
If you want to keep it, you can.
If you want to keep it, you can.
I'd like to...
Would you put some of your singing in this for the baby?
You want the baby to laugh at me.
You want the baby to laugh at me.
Yes.
How long will it take you to get home?
Many, many days and nights...
I'm sure we could find a country and western station.
No, thank you.
There.
Where?
The yellow one.
Oh, wow... I'll tell you what. When the baby is born, we'll go out in my back yard and wave to you.
Oh, wow... I'll tell you what. When the baby is born, we'll go out in my back yard and wave to you.
I will wave to you.
Where do you think you're going?
Thank you, Jennyhaydn. You are good. I must go alone now.
Thank you, Jennyhaydn. You are good. I must go alone now.
I said I would get you to your ship and that's where we're going to say goodbye.
Well...
I must go.
What do I do now?
You say you love me and kiss me 'goodbye.'
I love you.
I'm never going to see you again, am I?
I'm never going to see you again, am I?
No.
Tell the baby about me.
I will.
I will.
Goodbye.
Help me!!
You could have killed us both!!
You could have killed us both!!
He's kidnapping me!!!
Jesus Christ!! You crazy people...
Call the police!!
Call the police!!
Hey buddy... let her go...
Help me!!!
Hey, she doesn't want to go with you. Come on.
Oh God, man... don't shoot me... My mistake... I'm sorry...
He doesn't understand... just walk away...
You sure this is your car?
My grandmother's rich.
My grandmother's rich.
Slow down, slow down.
Slow down, slow down.
Geez, Mrs. Haydn, we just got going.
I told you I'm looking for someone.
In the cars, too?!
In the cars, too?!
I don't know where he is.
I don't know where he is.
This is going to be a real drag. I thought you wanted to go fast.
They after you?
What? No, of course not.
What? No, of course not.
Would be kinda neat if they were. I think I could outrun them. Maybe get my picture in the papers.
I'm telling you, you're going to find him at the roadblock, or right after, or not at all.
If he didn't want to go through the roadblock, is there any other way to get to Vegas?
If he didn't want to go through the roadblock, is there any other way to get to Vegas?
Fly.
The five-fifty. We already passed it. But it'll take him way out of his way.
Pull over. I've got to get back there.
Pull over. I've got to get back there.
Why wouldn't he want to go through the roadblock?... What did you guys do?... I won't tell anybody.
Why wouldn't he want to go through the roadblock?... What did you guys do?... I won't tell anybody.
It's easier not to tell if you don't know.
Wait. Could I have your autograph?
Sure.
I have nothing to do. I'd like to help you.
Don't worry. I'll be all right.
Is it for real?
Get Fox.
Aghh... I'm supposed to umpire a little league game tomorrow.
I wouldn't worry about it... There might not be any little league tomorrow.
This is crazy. What were we going to do if that had been the ship? We have two thirty calibre machine guns, three M16's and some handguns.
Give it a rest, Lyman.
That's because the ones that were hurt, died. They couldn't talk to you.
Any reports about monsters, people in Halloween masks, anything like that?
Good... It looks like we might be the welcoming committee, so I think we should try and figure out what we're gonna do if we have to come face to face with this creature.
Bell wants us to get down on our knees and bow.
Bell wants us to get down on our knees and bow.
Did your people have any contingencies rehearsed?
I know. She bought him a ticket for Lathrop Wells and put him on the bus. He didn't stay on though and they drove off together.
Doesn't make sense.
Doesn't make sense.
Maybe he's turned her into one of them. They enter the crowd around the helicopter.
Tell him I'm not here.
I did.
You get that, Lyman?
We're ready.
I'm telling you they're probably friendly.
Then why did they try and sneak in the back door? Tell me that. Why didn't they contact us first and say...
They're gonna let some local cop blow him away.
Save us all a lot of trouble.
Save us all a lot of trouble.
Jesus Lyman, you're an ignorant fool.
Jesus Lyman, you're an ignorant fool.
Bullshit!
Bullshit!
You have no conception of this, do you?
You have no conception of this, do you?
You jerk! You look at all the sweetness and light and goodness you think'll come out of this. You know what's gonna come out of this... The end of religion, the end of civilization, the end of the earth. We could become slaves, we could become a colony of these things. Don't you see that? Are you too stupid to see that?
This has always been my favorite time of day.
Very beautiful country up here...

Any signs of biological contamination, excessive radiation, anything like that?

Not on the landscape. We're trying to get a tube under the faceplate for a reading on possible deadly lifeforms but it's hard going.

Can you see under the faceplate?
Can you see under the faceplate?
No.
There's a good chance you could be wrong about this thing then...
Wait'll you see it.
We had a flight of F16's play tag with the spaceship over Michigan for an hour. Then it shot straight up and disappeared.
Was there visual contact?
Was there visual contact?
No, sir. Radar.
No, sir. Radar.
It could have been anything.
After I called in, I had a chance to sit down with the three locals. They swear there's another one that didn't make the ship... It might be alive.
People have made mistakes in these situations before.

I've been investigating sightings for seventeen years, Mr. Shermin. This one's real. We have a dead extra- terrestrial in that tent and another one in the area that might be alive. We've been visited. It's finally happened and the sooner Washington accepts that and starts figuring out how we're going to deal with these beings, the better off we're going to be.
Oh, Jesus.
We better get it into the box. Come on...
There's nothing... No reports of sightings or landings or anything... in the other parts of the country or overseas... Seems like a totally isolated incident.
It was only an accident that we discovered them.
It was only an accident that we discovered them.
I know, but...
You married, Major?
Twenty-eight years.
Twenty-eight years.
To the same woman?
To the same woman?
Yes.
Yes.
I tried it once... Fourteen years ago... 'I was a lousy husband and a worse father. The only thing I'm good at is this... At least until yesterday.
How would you describe the sounds we heard coming out of that thing's helmet?
It was kind of like clicking, maybe a language wasn't it?

Listen to this. A woman was kidnapped in Eau Claire this morning. When a citizen went to her rescue the kidnapper threatened him with a gun and shouted at him in a strange 'clicking gibberish'...

It was a man though... right?
It was a man though... right?
The police think he was high on drugs...
Nothing up there... The grass is matted down in a few places, but that could have been anything.
It was the husband. The police finally got a hold of the witness at work and showed him a picture of the woman.
Where are you going?
Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.
Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.
Hop in.
I don't understand.
Parlez vous Francais?... Habla Ingles?... Sprechen zie deutsch?
Good job, neither do I. What do you do for a living?
I don't understand.
I don't understand.
I'm a cook. Do you understand 'cook?'
I'm a cook. Do you understand 'cook?'
No.
I told you...
Judy, that's stupid.
Judy, that's stupid.
Well, maybe these men won't think so. We were asleep when a helicopter woke me up. It made me so nervous I went into the kitchen for something to eat. I happened to look out the window and there was Scott Haydn with this green thing draped over his arm pulling Jenny down the walk to the car.

You know that's impossible!

I know what I saw. I've seen him enough times.

Scott Haydn is dead. He died about three months ago. We went to the funeral.
Is there a reward in this?
Huh?... Eh... no, there isn't
Huh?... Eh... no, there isn't
Because I'm the one who called the police, you know.
Because I'm the one who called the police, you know.
Yeah, thanks. We appreciate that.
Yeah, thanks. We appreciate that.
Hey, it's none of my business why you're chasing a retard... You want my opinion, it's the girl. She had to hold the guy's hand all the way to the car like he was a kid.

You saw that?
You saw that?
Hey... he didn't look like no big time criminal to me.
Eh... the store tells you to call when there's trouble, so they won't get sued... But that shouldn't matter if there's a reward, right?
I wouldn't think so.
I wouldn't think so.
That's what I thought. So remember it was me because sometimes rewards come late, you know.

We will. Something's wrong here. She's helping him now.
Hello...
I must get to my ship, Mr. Shermin.
I must get to my ship, Mr. Shermin.
We can't let you do that.
We can't let you do that.
I don't want to hurt anybody. I just want to go home.
All the roads into Death Valley are blocked. We'd like to talk to you.
If I talk to you, I will miss my ship.
If I talk to you, I will miss my ship.
Hold on a minute... Let's take the chance, George.
Yeah, that's right.
I saw you play, man. You were good. Like a fucking freight train I remember saying. So what happened, injuries or what?
I saw you play, man. You were good. Like a fucking freight train I remember saying. So what happened, injuries or what?
Bullshit politics.
Bullshit politics.
It's always politics. Like this thing we're in here, he's paying you to tune me up, right? But I could pay you more not to. See what I mean? I could write you a check right now--

Okay cash! Logical. Here's everything I have on me, what do you say? How about a Rolex?

Just not the eyes.
Okay, let's get you wired up. I hope this axle grease you got in your hair doesn't screw up the squid receptors.
What's all this squid shit?
Superconducting QUantum Interference Device. SQUID. Got it? There's gonna be a test.
Hey, fuck you, man.
Hey, fuck you, man.
Easy, Eduardo, easy. Preserve a sense of humor at all times. Okay, the receptor rig... what I'm putting on your head... sends a signal to the recorder. See we call it "being wired," but there's no wire. You gotta keep the recorder close... five, six feet away max, like in your jacket pocket by the bed or wherever you're going to close escrow, know

Yeah, right.
Some tips. Don't dart your eyes around. Don't look in the mirror or you'll ID yourself. OK? You got a half hour of tape, so give me some lead-in to the main event. But don't wait too long, I don't want to be going out for popcorn. And don't act natural. Don't act at all. Just forget the thing is on. Got it?
No problem.
No problem.
A star is born.
We have nothing to talk about, Lenny.
Joey, make sure Mr. Nero gets safely to his car.
Lenny the loser. Panhandler of stolen dreams.
Leave him alone, Tran.
Leave him alone, Tran.
He's no concern of mine, as long as you don't talk to him. Don't talk to anybody. You understand? Not with everything that's going on right now.
He's no concern of mine, as long as you don't talk to him. Don't talk to anybody. You understand? Not with everything that's going on right now.
You're too goddamned paranoid.
You're too goddamned paranoid.
Paranoia's only reality on a finer scale.
Look, Tran... Lenny just came by to give me some bad news. An old friend of mine has been murdered. You remember Iris?
A tragic story, no doubt. How'd you get up here?
I made my choice, Lenny.
You're going down.
You said you were going to get her out of this.
Maybe now you appreciate the danger we're in. It was touching the way you stood by me in there. "Stand by your man". I was moved. You were very good. I don't think he even understands that you did it for him.

He doesn't know what's going on. Leave him alone.
He doesn't know what's going on. Leave him alone.
I'd love to. But he keeps showing up. And you keep talking to him. I can't have that--
The only time a whore should open her mouth is when she's giving head.
Fuck you.
Fuck you.
Maybe later.
Well, I'm certainly in the mood for a party.
Take her up to the suite. Have a glass of champagne... or six... I'll be up in a while to help you ring in the New Year.
Take her up to the suite. Have a glass of champagne... or six... I'll be up in a while to help you ring in the New Year.
I live for the moment.
This piece of puke hired me to kill you, baby. Do you believe that? Isn't that right, Tran? You pinhead.
Oh my God. I don't believe this is happening.
Oh my God. I don't believe this is happening.
Believe it. Now bring me the trodes, baby. Come on, quick.
Believe it. Now bring me the trodes, baby. Come on, quick.
What're you going to do?
You can't just... kill him.
I'm not. Just a little poach job.
I'm not. Just a little poach job.
Jesus.
Jesus.
Hey, he was going to kill you. And this ratfuck paid to have Iris killed, to save his own sorry ass.
Look, baby, it's now of never... the guy is a known input junkie, so a little OD won't surprise anybody. It's the only way we can be together. You know it's true.
My God.
You were supposed to go downstairs, baby.
I know. I don't always do exactly what I'm told. So I said, 'Do you enjoy watching me?' And you said -- come on Max.
I know. I don't always do exactly what I'm told. So I said, 'Do you enjoy watching me?' And you said -- come on Max.
I said, 'Yeah. I'd even do it for free.'
I said, 'Yeah. I'd even do it for free.'
Uh huh. And I said, 'That's good, because I like the feeling of someone watching me. I acquired the taste from Lenny.'
And then she said, 'Since we're going to be spending so much time together--'
'We might as well make the best of it.'
Hey, you going to watch or you going to do?
Watch and see.
I feel like you're turning me into a VCR.
I just want to see what we're like together through your eyes.
I don't feel anything. Is it on?
Forget it's there.
Forget it's there.
Make me forget it, baby.
Cut it out, Tran.
Too bad about your guy Jeriko. Tough break.
I don't think that's a good idea, Lenny.
I just got to talk to you for one second.
Faith, call me, okay?
No, Lenny.
Hi, baby. I've missed you.
I know. Lenny, if Tran finds you talking to me he'll hurt you.
I know. Lenny, if Tran finds you talking to me he'll hurt you.
I'm already hurting.
You have to go. I mean it.
Yeah, OK, whatever you say. Just answer one question. Is anything wrong? Iris said you might be in trouble.
Yeah, OK, whatever you say. Just answer one question. Is anything wrong? Iris said you might be in trouble.
You talked to Iris? When?
You talked to Iris? When?
Tonight.
Tonight.
Well I haven't seen her in months. Who knows what's going on in her head. You're really running out of excuses to come around, aren't you?
Well I haven't seen her in months. Who knows what's going on in her head. You're really running out of excuses to come around, aren't you?
I know you Faith. You're afraid of something. What's going on?
I know you Faith. You're afraid of something. What's going on?
Let it alone, Lenny. It'll take care of itself.
Let it alone, Lenny. It'll take care of itself.
It's Tran, isn't it? This guy is poison, Faith. Listen to me. He's got you walled in on all sides. And he uses the wire too much, he gets off on tape, not on you.
It's Tran, isn't it? This guy is poison, Faith. Listen to me. He's got you walled in on all sides. And he uses the wire too much, he gets off on tape, not on you.
That's a good one, coming from you.
That's a good one, coming from you.
Why don't you just split? You don't love him, anybody can see that. And to him you're just some kinda possession, like a Ferrari, something to show the other guys.
Why don't you just split? You don't love him, anybody can see that. And to him you're just some kinda possession, like a Ferrari, something to show the other guys.
He has his uses too.
He has his uses too.
What? He gonna record you on his label?
What? He gonna record you on his label?
Maybe.
Maybe.
Come on, Faith! He's just toying with you. And when he gets bored, you'll be yesterday's papers.
Look, baby, I've watched you create yourself out of nothing. You're like a goddamn cruise missile, targeted on making it. And you will.
Damn right.
Damn right.
It's you up on that stage, not him. You don't need him.
You have to get out of here. If Tran catches you he'll... he's acting crazy. He's doing way too much playback and he's getting completely paranoid. He's such a control freak, he's even paying Max to follow me around.
Max Pelcher? You're kidding?
Max Pelcher? You're kidding?
Yeah, for about a month now. Lenny, just stay away from Tran, okay? And stay away from me. Stop trying to rescue me. Those days are over. I'm a big girl now. Stop trying to save me, okay, because I don't need saving... Just... give up on me.
Yeah, for about a month now. Lenny, just stay away from Tran, okay? And stay away from me. Stop trying to rescue me. Those days are over. I'm a big girl now. Stop trying to save me, okay, because I don't need saving... Just... give up on me.
Can't do it.
Can't do it.
You know one of the ways movies still have Squid beat? Because they always say "The End." You always know when it's over. It's over! Now please leave. I have to go on again in a couple of minutes.
You're crazier than I thought, Lenny. Coming here... Tran's just in there.
Iris is dead. She was murdered.
Who did it?
Don't know. But this guy's real damaged goods. Iris knew someone was after her... and she said you were in danger too. Now no more games, Faith. Whatever you're hiding, whatever's going on, you have to get out of here now. Come with me right now. Don't even think about it.

Then what? Then what, Lenny?! You going to protect me? Big tough guy. You're a talker, Lenny. You don't even have a gun.
Then what? Then what, Lenny?! You going to protect me? Big tough guy. You're a talker, Lenny. You don't even have a gun.
I have a gun. It's under my bed.
I have a gun. It's under my bed.
You don't know what you're fucking with here.
You don't know what you're fucking with here.
Tell me.
What's going on?
Faith, we know about Jeriko. Iris made me a copy of the tape.
Faith, we know about Jeriko. Iris made me a copy of the tape.
Oh God, Lenny. I was trying to keep you out of this.
How did it happen? What was Iris doing riding around with Jeriko wearing a wire?
We should talk alone.
We should talk alone.
No. Mace is in this.
So finally he gives Iris some cash and tells her to check into the hotel under a wrong name till he figures out what to do.
Yeah... he figured out what to do all right.
Yeah... he figured out what to do all right.
You think Tran killed her?
You think Tran killed her?
The killer knew right where she was. Because he put her there.
The killer knew right where she was. Because he put her there.
What a nightmare.
I understand. No, I'm not.
You understand? Attorney! Right? Am I right?
You understand? Attorney! Right? Am I right?
That's right.
No.
A virgin brain! Well we're going to start you off right. So what do you know about this? Save us some time...

Exactly anything. Whatever you want. Whoever you want to be. Fabri, get us another round, would you.
Sounds good.
I can get you what you want. You just have to talk to me. I'm your priest, your shrink, your main connection to the switchboard of souls. I'm the Magic Man, the Santa Claus of the Subconscious.

Listen, before we get into numbers, I want you to try a taste. I got a deck with me.
What? Right Here?
What? Right Here?
Step into my office.
Yeah, I'm interested, but can we get someplace a little less public?
You nervous? Forget it. The cops have more to worry about in this city than the squid-trade, believe me--
You see the look on that preppy puke's face? Fuckin' pissed in his Topsiders.
Okay. It was funny. But it cost me money.
Okay. It was funny. But it cost me money.
Come on, amigo, the world's full of marks. And nobody knows how to work 'em like you do, pal. You could sell a goddamn rat's asshole for a wedding ring! Let me buy you a drink.

Least you can do.
Bobbyyyy! Tequila por favor! Double shots. Make it Tres Generaciones, huh. Nothin' but the best for my good friend Lenny, the finest cop that ever got thrown off the vice squad. Hey, nice tie.
Thanks, Max.
Thanks, Max.
D'you always have to dress like a fuckin' pimp?

This tie cost more than your entire wardrobe.

That's not sayin' much.
That's not sayin' much.
It's the one thing that stands between me and the jungle.
You were lucky, Max.
Yup. So darn lucky. I wake up with a .22-short floating in my brainpan, and a cop pension I can't live off of. Good thing I wasn't any luckier. Bobby! Another shooter right here!
Naw. She won't call me.
Just as well, Lenny. You gotta get past it. I mean sure, Faith was by far the most outstanding woman a guy like you could ever hope to get, I mean it's completely and deeply humiliating that she's gone, but it's over, campadre.

Thanks, Max. I'm touched by your concern.
I just hate to see you pining away. It makes me want to vomit, frankly. Broken hearts are for assholes.
Hey, Iris, you okay?
See, if you packed your piece you could've made the guy see sense.
Uh unh, carrying a gun wrecks the line of a fine jacket.
Uh unh, carrying a gun wrecks the line of a fine jacket.
An ex-cop that doesn't carry. It's embarrassing. I oughta not be seen with you. Hey, Mace. What's goin' on?
I'm telling ya, it's over. We used it all up--
Shutup a second!
Shoulda told me about your new gig, buddy.
I was gonna tell ya. Hey, it's just a job. I feel like shit about it.
I was gonna tell ya. Hey, it's just a job. I feel like shit about it.
You should feel like shit.
You should feel like shit.
I figured, what the hell, I could take the prick's money and make sure Faith was OK at the same time. Do us both good. Right?
I figured, what the hell, I could take the prick's money and make sure Faith was OK at the same time. Do us both good. Right?
Fairly twisted logic, Max, even for you. Hey, at least you got a job! Watch her for me. Stay on her.
Fairly twisted logic, Max, even for you. Hey, at least you got a job! Watch her for me. Stay on her.
I'm on her.
You alright? Y'okay?
Yeah. No, not really.
Yeah. No, not really.
Let's work it.
Let's work it.
Not now... I don't want to think about it--
Not now... I don't want to think about it--
Come on, Lenny. You used to be good at this stuff. Play it down. What's the perp doing?
Come on, Lenny. You used to be good at this stuff. Play it down. What's the perp doing?
He stalks her. He rapes her. Then he does her...

And he records it. Thrill kill. Wants to see it again. And again.

He records himself raping and killing her--

But at the same time he's sending the signal to her--
But at the same time he's sending the signal to her--
So she feels... what he feels... while he's in her. The thrill while he's killing her... is sent to her, heightening her fear... which in turn heightens the turn on for him. I've seen a lot, Max.
So she feels... what he feels... while he's in her. The thrill while he's killing her... is sent to her, heightening her fear... which in turn heightens the turn on for him. I've seen a lot, Max.
So've I. Too much.
So've I. Too much.
But this is a bad one.
But this is a bad one.
Top ten.
Top ten.
He makes her see her own death, feeds off the reaction... killer and victim merging... orgasm and agony merging. And he records it all.
That's right. He wants to share. Needs an audience. This is one sick puppy.
Why me?
Hey, the last day of the world and you spend it in bed.
W'sup, Max?
Faith OK?
Yeah. She's leaving with Tran so I got to boogie. Real quick... Iris checked into the Sheraton last night under a false name. Paid cash.
Yeah. She's leaving with Tran so I got to boogie. Real quick... Iris checked into the Sheraton last night under a false name. Paid cash.
Looks like she was holding out.

Yup. Hey, so I heard you dropped in on Tran last night. Another slick Lenny move.

He's in this somehow... I don't know how. Just stay close to Faith.
He's in this somehow... I don't know how. Just stay close to Faith.
I'm on her, amigo. No worries. Gotta jam.
Sounds like Tick's already celebrating.
You may be a little overdressed for this party. Yo, Tick! It's Lenny. Open up!
He's been cooked-off
Is he dead?
Is he dead?
No. But his frontal lobes are like two runny eggs. They put an amplifier in-line to boost the signal till it french-fried his brain.
Whattya mean?
All I'm saying... you don't know how high up the food chain this thing goes. I've heard stuff.
All I'm saying... you don't know how high up the food chain this thing goes. I've heard stuff.
What stuff?
What stuff?
Smoke. Rumors. I've heard stuff about a death squad. A group a guys loyal to the hardline school. Guys that've had too many years of city hall and the review boards and the goddamn media pissing down their necks, suspending cops right and left, tying their hands... while outa the other side a their mouths these same people're squealing save us, save us, do
Jesus.
Yeah. So don't walk near me in public, alright.
Yeah. So don't walk near me in public, alright.
Thanks, buddy. See... things weren't bad enough. They weren't fucking bad enough!
Mace... no disrespect... but you run this on the 11 o'clock news, by midnight you got the biggest riot in history. They'll see the fucking smoke from Canada.
Okay... what about Strickland?
Okay... what about Strickland?
No. Bad idea.
He's got her up in the room, under guard. And he's still working the party... acting smooth like nothin's nothin'. So buddy... I say we work a trade.
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
Give him the tape. See? It's fucking brilliant! The tape for Faith. I know he'll go for it. I can set it up.

This is what we laughingly refer to as a plan, right?
This is what we laughingly refer to as a plan, right?
Come on! If he gives us any shit, we kill 'em all. Whattya say? Just get your butt down here. If I'm not at the shindig downstairs go to the room. It's 2203. You writin'?
2-2-0-3. Got it. Stay on her.
I intend to.
No. I suppose not. I didn't know you were colorblind, Max.
Only way I could stand your ties.
I'll have that. Glock 22. Nice.
Where's Faith?
Where's Faith?
I sent her to the party. I figured I'd wait up here until you killed Tran.
I sent her to the party. I figured I'd wait up here until you killed Tran.
What makes you think I'm gonna kill Tran?
You just did.
Jesus!
Jesus!
You know, statistically that's the second most common word people say right before they die. Shit being number one.
So... I killed Tran. Then you ran in, being on his payroll, and shot me.
That's pretty much the way it happened.
Wait a minute. Now I'm remembering. I killed Iris too, didn't I?
That's right. They'll find the original of her snuff clip in your apartment. The one I left for you at the club was a copy.
That's right. They'll find the original of her snuff clip in your apartment. The one I left for you at the club was a copy.
Was I a really busy guy? Did I do Tick too?
Was I a really busy guy? Did I do Tick too?
You bet. Did you like it?
Picture it... I feel like I gotta share this with somebody. It's too perfect.
I won't say anything.
I won't say anything.
I know. So, I'm working for this puke, right? And he says he'll pay me quite large to do the hooker. But also I gotta do his bitch girlfriend cause she knows the whole score and she's totally out of control.
Only he doesn't know about me and Faith. So I say to myself, if I turn the job down, he just gets somebody else. And I lose Faith... to coin a phrase. So to buy time, I do the skank. I still gotta do something about Tran... I figure it's him or me... but I can't cap him without a chump to take the
And who was, regrettably, also your best fucking friend.

Just those two loose-cannon cops running around covering their butts.
Just those two loose-cannon cops running around covering their butts.
Yeah. Pretty zany, huh? All this shit caused by a random traffic stop. Hey... nothing means nothing. You know that. Look around... the whole planet's in total chaos. You gotta take what you can, while you can. Cause some shitbird can come up and put a fuckin' .22 in the back a your head any second.
How did you hook up with Faith?
This dink hires me a month ago to eyeball her, right? But Faith knows me from you, right, so she comes up to me and says, 'Hey Max why you following me?' I say, 'I'll buy you a drink and explain.' And she says...
Don't have a fucking coronary, Lenny.
Well you could've at least warned me. You know I hate the zap... when they die. It just brings down your whole day. Jeez, Tick.
Well you could've at least warned me. You know I hate the zap... when they die. It just brings down your whole day. Jeez, Tick.
Sorry.
How'd you get the tape? Why didn't the cops put it in evidence?
With all the blood I guess they didn't see the rig. Guy had it under a wig.
With all the blood I guess they didn't see the rig. Guy had it under a wig.
Yeah, but how'd it get to you?
Yeah, but how'd it get to you?
I got ways, Lenny, I got ways. Okay, okay... I got a deal with some a the paramedics. My guy pages me and I pick it up at the morgue. So whaddya think? This clip's gotta be worth at least a grand. Right?

Tick. Not to dash your hopes, but I don't deal this kind of product, you know that. I'll give you four for it, cause I've gotta cut off the last bit. And my customers want uncut.

Yeah, well, the first part's okay. Better than the usual soaps you bring me.
Now that is cold, Lenny. I always bring you choice.
Sure, like this low-grade shit here, some girl in a fight with her boyfriend... it's a test-pattern. Nothing happens. I'm snorin'.
Hey, you're always saying, 'Bring me real life. Bring me street life. And, like, one man's mundane and desperate existence is another man's Technicolor.'

What clip? What was it?

I don't know, man, she wouldn't let me see it. Said I wouldn't want to see it. She said she was going to give it to you to hold for her. Like insurance or somethin'
I don't know, man, she wouldn't let me see it. Said I wouldn't want to see it. She said she was going to give it to you to hold for her. Like insurance or somethin'
She never gave me a tape.
You come to peddle me some tapes, Lenny? For old time's sake? Make a couple bucks for the holidays?
You're not a client anymore, Tran. I wouldn't sell you the sweat off a dead dog's balls.
You're not a client anymore, Tran. I wouldn't sell you the sweat off a dead dog's balls.
I already got everything I need from you.
Show a little respect, Nero. The man was an important artist.

That would be between me and Faith, wouldn't it?
Charm.
Uh huh. Look, Nero. I'll make you an offer. Take her. Right now. If she wants to go, if she's unhappy here, she can go. I'll let her choose. Faith always knows what she wants. Hands off. See?
It's alright. He means it.
I do mean it. And I mean this... if Faith stays you go away and never come back. You scuttle back into your cockroach hole and never cross my vision again. You understand?

Your sex life?
Your sex life?
Your existence.
Greetings, gents. So let's hear this week's sad story.
They jerked my wheels, d'you believe it? I mean it's outrageous, the computer errors the banks are making lately. Have you noticed?
Thanks for giving me a ride. I just have a few stops, mostly on the west side--
Whoa, whoa, whoa. I said I'd drop you home, but I'm not taking you on your sleazoid rounds. I've already pulled twelve hours today.

Lenny, this may be a hard concept for you, but friends don't have to pay their friends.
Jeez, you're pathetic. Okay, I got a pickup at the St. James. I'll take you there, you can get a cab.
Mace! You're a life-saver.
Mace! You're a life-saver.

Everybody needs to take a walk to the dark end of the street sometime, it's what we are. But now the risks are outa line. The streets are a war zone. And sex can kill you. So you slip on the trodes, you get what you need and it keeps you from jumping your tracks.

Fumitsu.
Fumitsu.
Mr. Fumitsu, good evening sir, Leonard Nero, Security Express. Lornette Mason here is just completing our routine driver evaluation. We do it to make sure that out VIP clients, such as yourself, are always treated as honored guests. I just need to ride up front and take some notes, if you don't mind.
What the fuck are you doing?
Coming with you.
Coming with you.
You will not live to see the morning.
Are we having a bad night?
Let's talk in the car.
Hey, careful on the jacket. This is Armani. You angry?
I've had enough of this shit. You're on foot, Lenny.
I've had enough of this shit. You're on foot, Lenny.
In LA? Are you crazy?
I need my case. It's still in the back.
Get it.
That would be no.
I've had it. No more wirehead shit in my car. You understand? You want to poach your lobes, do it somewhere else.
I've had it. No more wirehead shit in my car. You understand? You want to poach your lobes, do it somewhere else.
Okay, you got my attention, but this is cutting off the circulation to my head, here. D'you mind?
I thought we were friends.
No, see a friend is more than one person constantly doing favors for another. You just suck people along with your schemes and your scams and your slick act. Well I'm out. I got a kid, I got rent, I got an ex- husband someplace who doesn't send me a dime of support... I'm just trying to hold on here.

Macey... I've never seen you like this.
Macey... I've never seen you like this.
Lenny, you're turning into some kinda squid-head low-life. You're always broke, you just go from one score to the next. And you're getting strung out... you don't even see it. Getting high on your own supply like some crack dealer.

I know you wouldn't be saying all this if you didn't care about me. Thanks, Mace. Really.
I know you wouldn't be saying all this if you didn't care about me. Thanks, Mace. Really.
Look, I gotta get some sleep.
Look, I gotta get some sleep.
You still like me, don't you? We're still buddies?
Yeah. I don't see a way out of it.
Macey, I know you're tired, but can you drop me at the Retinal Fetish? It's on your way.
Macey, I know you're tired, but can you drop me at the Retinal Fetish? It's on your way.
Jesus, Lenny.
Jesus, Lenny.
Begging? Groveling? Any pathetic behavior at all? Will that help? Faith's there tonight, and I've got to talk to her.
Begging? Groveling? Any pathetic behavior at all? Will that help? Faith's there tonight, and I've got to talk to her.
Sure, Lenny. The only thing worse than a junkie is someone in love.
Who's the new side of beef in Tran's posse?
Guy named Wade Beemer. Used to be a running back for the Rams in '96 and '97.
Guy named Wade Beemer. Used to be a running back for the Rams in '96 and '97.
Rams... that's football, right?
Forget her.
She still loves me.
She still loves me.
She thinks you're a bucket of dog vomit. Trust me on this.
She thinks you're a bucket of dog vomit. Trust me on this.
She's my destiny.

Destiny? You living in a perfume commercial? She's a hard-climber that dropped you like a used tampon when she got a better ride.
Destiny? You living in a perfume commercial? She's a hard-climber that dropped you like a used tampon when she got a better ride.
You'll see.
You're some piece of work, you know that. Just calmly backstroking around in the big toilet bowl, and somehow you never let it touch you. I mean, between Vice and this so- called occupation you're in now, you must've seen it all.
I have crawled through the gutter... through every wrinkle in the human brain.
I have crawled through the gutter... through every wrinkle in the human brain.
What I'm saying. But you still come out this goofball romantic.
What I'm saying. But you still come out this goofball romantic.
It is my sword and my shield, Macey.
What's that? Present from Faith?
No idea.
What is it?
Go to the Sunset Sheraton. RIGHT NOW! Just go! GO!
My God, Lenny. What is it?
Black. Jack.
Black. Jack.
Blackjack? I don't understand--
Blackjack? I don't understand--
Snuff clip. It was Iris. She said she needed my help and I... aw Jesus, Mace... the sick fucker killed her.
Snuff clip. It was Iris. She said she needed my help and I... aw Jesus, Mace... the sick fucker killed her.
Are you sure it's real?
And gives it to you.
Wants to share.
Cause you're the man, right? The Magic Man. If it's got something to do with the wire, sooner or later it washes up on your beach.
I've never dealt in black-jacks. Never. Everybody knows that.
Jesus, Mace. Back off.
This guy is someone you know, one of your squid-head contacts.
Uh unh. No way! They'd crucify me.
So some psycho wire-freak gets to keep running around--
Is this great fabric or what?
You ever wonder why you get beat up a lot?
You ever wonder why you get beat up a lot?
Never really thought about it.
He knows what he's doing. He's worn before... a lot.
So that gives you something.
So that gives you something.
It gives me... I don't know... maybe two hundred people who I know wear.
Don't crank the gain any more. You're gonna fry yourself.
I need to see more... get more detail. Something. I feel his presence, so strong...
No more, Lenny.
Yeah. I'm ghosting pretty bad.
She came to me for help. I should have read it better... I just figured, y'know... another strung- out hooker having a bad night.
It's not your fault.
See, it's all about what they see walking in. A dead hooker, handcuffs, penetration... they'll see a trick gone wrong. Random kill. The kind you never solve.
But that doesn't add, does it.
But that doesn't add, does it.
No it doesn't.
No it doesn't.
Because Iris knew somebody was after her.
She said "If they get me". They. Which means the whole sex-killer thing is a cover, which means somebody whacked her for a reason.
So the guy's not a sicko.
So the guy's not a sicko.
If he could do what's on that tape, he's a sicko.
If he could do what's on that tape, he's a sicko.
Okay, so he's a freak who thinks he's sane pretending to be a freak. The point is, he was a hitter. Somebody wanted to shut her up. But why not just put a little lead in her ear?
Okay, so he's a freak who thinks he's sane pretending to be a freak. The point is, he was a hitter. Somebody wanted to shut her up. But why not just put a little lead in her ear?
Because it had to look random. Not connected to anything or anyone. But then why give the rape to me?

That's where it gets a little strange.

Now you're really getting paranoid.
The question is not whether I am paranoid, but whether I am paranoid enough. You want to rub my neck?
Sure.
How's Zander?
OK. He asks about you all the time. It's been weeks since you've seen him.
I'm sorry about getting on your case earlier. I just see you getting sucked in deeper and deeper, and I -- anyway. I'm sorry.
S'okay. I know you still love me.
Whatup Lenny?
Jesus, Mace!
Where we going?
Anywhere. We'll talk about it in the car.
What is it?
This tie doesn't go with blue!
Will you relax. There's nobody back there.
Mace, the guy had a knife. To my throat. In my living room. Relaxing might be right out, okay?!
Mace, the guy had a knife. To my throat. In my living room. Relaxing might be right out, okay?!
You better keep a low profile for a while.
You better keep a low profile for a while.
No shit. You got someplace in mind?
Lenny, have you lost it completely?
Easy, there, Mom. Easy. This is audio only. John Coltrane. "A Love Supreme." Give it a listen, let me know what you think, maybe you won't go for it now, but it'll get in your head and grow like a seed into something really beautiful.
Think back about what she said. Exactly what she said.
She wanted to go out to my car, something about my car...
She wanted to go out to my car, something about my car...
Something in your car...
Lenny, give them the tape.
It's in my case. Okay? I'm going to open my case...
Shit!
Take it easy. The glass is bullet resistant.
Take it easy. The glass is bullet resistant.
Bullet resistant? Whatever happened to bullet proof?
Bullet resistant? Whatever happened to bullet proof?
Lenny. Calm down. This is what I do.
Goddamnit!! 911 is busy!
It's okay, Lenny They'd never get here in time anyway.
This is bad.
The gas tank's going to go any second!
Are you out of your fucking mind?!
Fire's out, isn't it?
I can't believe we had to give them the damn tape.
Yeah, me neither. It was one of my favorites. Me and Faith in a hot tub on my birthday. I'm going to really miss it.
Those two guys were cops.
You sure?
You sure?
It's the walk. Something. Anyway, they'll run your plates and get your address. We gotta keep moving.
Tell me.
I can't tell you. You've got to see.
I can't tell you. You've got to see.
Uh unh. I won't do it.
Uh unh. I won't do it.
Mace. I know what you think about the wire. But I'm asking you to do this. It's that important.
Hang on. Hang on, Max. You see?
I see. I see the earth opening up and swallowing us all.
I see. I see the earth opening up and swallowing us all.
Yeah I know. So what do we do?
We got to make another copy of this. Little life insurance.
You know what this tape could do if it gets out.
You know what this tape could do if it gets out.
I've got a good idea, yeah.
I've got a good idea, yeah.
People finding out... seeing... that the LAPD just flat out executed Jeriko One. Jesus. Maybe they ought to see.
People finding out... seeing... that the LAPD just flat out executed Jeriko One. Jesus. Maybe they ought to see.
Maybe. But tonight is probably not the best night. Come on, we're rollin'.
So, let's see, I've got Tran's goons, some squidhead psycho and the LAPD all trying to kill me. Happy new year, Lenny.
Well, look at the plus side.
Well, look at the plus side.
There's a plus side?
There's a plus side?
Yeah. You gave up your hot tub tape to save me. That's real progress for you.
Yeah. You gave up your hot tub tape to save me. That's real progress for you.
It was a tough call.
It was a tough call.
I still can't square the psycho smarts of whoever did Iris with those two cops.
I still can't square the psycho smarts of whoever did Iris with those two cops.
I don't think those cops did Iris. I think whoever Iris was wearing for killed her.
I don't think those cops did Iris. I think whoever Iris was wearing for killed her.
Why?
Why?
To break the trail. If those cops had gotten hold of her, they would have beat it out of her who she was wearing for, and then gone after them too. Our killer is running as scared as we are. Which makes him really dangerous. Judging by how scared I am.
He's totally cut off from the outer world.
How long does it last? Oh.
The only card we have to play is the tape. You know, we get it to the media somehow...
Yeah, right, blow it open.
Who's Strickland?
Deputy Commissioner Palmer Strickland. The sanctimonious prick who busted me out. His ass is so tight when he farts only dogs can hear it. I know this guy. If there's one cop who's not dirty it's him.
Kinda guy you can count on in a pinch.
Why didn't he just go public with the tape? Save himself that way.
Okay, we gotta get over there. Can you borrow a dress from Cecile or something--
I'm not going.
I'm not going.
Whatya mean? We're going! Tran's gonna do her right there unless--
Whatya mean? We're going! Tran's gonna do her right there unless--
Lenny... shutup. Just park your mouth and listen. It's a set-up. Think about it! Why's he been sending you tapes? To freak you, get you to rush in without thinking. Then they put one in you, put one in her, put the gun in your hand... crime of passion. This guy's bent enough to think of that.
Yeah. Lenny. I have.
It didn't stop you from loving them. Right? Or understanding them, or being able to forgive them...
It didn't stop you from loving them. Right? Or understanding them, or being able to forgive them...
I guess.
I guess.
And it didn't stop you from wanting to protect them. Did it?
And it didn't stop you from wanting to protect them. Did it?
No. It didn't.
I worked Vice, Narcotics... Violent Crimes... and I saw every known depravity. I was lost, Mace. In outer darkness. Then I busted this strung-out little teeny-hooker. When I met Faith she was just another runaway giving twenty dollar blowjobs to buy crank. Another lost soul.
You never told me.
You never told me.
But she was different. There was a light in her eyes... and she had this voice. It was scary, all that pain coming out of that little body. Like she could take all the hurt and rage of the entire world and lift it up to heaven in one voice. I helped her. And I promised her that I'd always be there... to protect

No, it's not.
Mace... you're a girl.
Good, Lenny. I can see why the detective gig didn't work out. Come on.
Got your ticket?
No. They must have sent it to my beach house by mistake.
You see Tran?
Uh unh.
Alright. We're going up.
And do what? Take on his whole posse?
And do what? Take on his whole posse?
I still got one ace to play. Tran's got what I want... and I've got what he wants...
That's the original. There are no copies.
Exactly. That's why it's a make- able deal.
Take it to him.
A cop? You want me to trust a cop?!
A cop? You want me to trust a cop?!
No. Trust me.
Oh boy. What if you're wrong?
Then we'll be right where we are now.
Then we'll be right where we are now.
Yeah, right. Fucked.
Are we under arrest?
Naw. They just have to ask us a few questions... for about six hours.
Hey, Lenny. We made it.
Yeah. We did.
Well... Get going. You're still bleeding.
See you downtown.
See you downtown.
Yeah. See you there.
Where were you Mom? Did you meet a guy?
Just Lenny.
Just Lenny.
Right. That explains it.
Right. That explains it.
Are you going to make me beg?
What is that?
Cheerios and wieners. I made it myself. It's good.
Cheerios and wieners. I made it myself. It's good.
Well give me some then... I'm starving.
We're going to aunt Cecile's, honey. We're going to watch fireworks from there. Let's go. Chop chop.
Aw, Mom!
No. I haven't noticed because I make my payments. So, Max Pelcher, how's the P.I. business?
Sucks. Hey, Bobby, turn that up.
Hey, isn't that Tran Vo?
Yup. He was Jeriko's manager. Bummer, Tran! Lost your golden goose. Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
Yup. He was Jeriko's manager. Bummer, Tran! Lost your golden goose. Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
But I mean isn't he Faith's new--
But I mean isn't he Faith's new--
Sssssh! Not in front of Lenny. You may trigger a maudlin display which will force us to tranquilize him.
He's skull-fucking you, bud. Trying to get a reaction. Maybe pushing you to do something.
Maybe he just figures Lenny will appreciate what he's created. It's the dark end of the street, Lenny. How do you like it now?
Problem is, Lenny knows everybody.
Take the tape to the cops.
Those two psycho cops are on a slash-and-burn to find the tape and cover their tracks.
This seems a little sophisticated for them. These are not subtle guys.
This seems a little sophisticated for them. These are not subtle guys.
There's more to this whole thing than you think.
So you're saying we just pretend is didn't happen? It happened! The LAPD executed one of the most important black men in America! Who the fuck are you to bury this?!
Fine. Do you want blood running waist deep in the storm drains? The gangbangers'll spread like a wave through this city and burn it to the ground. And when the fires start the street cops'll be capping off at anything that moves. It'll be all- out war and you know it.

Yeah, well maybe it's time for a war!
You really want that on your head?
Was this him?
Um... he was older.

Besides that.

To be honest, when I'm working, I don't look at faces much. He knew the guy's name.

Testa?
Testa?
The bearded guy, the creep. Oh, one other thing. Testa, if that's his name, he kept mentioning my feet. Said I had very pretty feet.
Have you had a chance to think about --
Zorro. Yes, ran it through my files, even asked around: came up completely blank. Thought there might be a Mexico connection, El Paso and all, but nothing. Fooled around with the letter "Z," turned it on it's side, got "N" -- there Ng, he's Vietnamese. The only thing that came to mind was zero, not Zorro. Remember Suspect Zero?

No.
No.
Before your time. It was Richard Low's brainchild, or, lack-of-brain child. The Behavioral Sciences Unit at Quantico is essentially the product of three men: David Koessler, Dick Low and myself. Low was a field agent, Koessler administrative, I was teaching criminology. Low came up with the concept of a serial killer's signature. He invented profiling. Everything we know about profiling started with Richard Low...
...well, there was some friction: I wanted to write up my work, educate the public, but Koessler wouldn't allow it. Low felt Koessler was more interested in career advancement than catching killers. Koessler had Low reassigned to the Pacific Northwest, Seattle. You know when they say, stick it where the sun don't shine? That's where they stuck Dick Low.
Pacific Northwest is a hotbed for serials.
Pacific Northwest is a hotbed for serials.
You got that right. Low became obsessed with the Green River murders, the case had been inactive for ten years at that point. He argued the Green River Killer had actually become Suspect Zero, this master murderer who killed without pattern, killed literally hundreds of victims -- male, female, old, young, straight, gay -- and who was still killing, even though there were no
Does Koessler know about the Suspect Zero theory?
Of course. He knows everything about Dick Low.
Welcome back, sir. How was the vacation?
Takes four days to chill, then its time to come back. Is that...?
Takes four days to chill, then its time to come back. Is that...?
Yeah.
Agent Duncan, there's an interstate issue up on 54, run out there.
I'm babysitting the DEA guys this afternoon, Casio and I. You said that was top priority.
Agents Duncan, Mackelway. Anything new?
Just mopping up. Nine bodies in all.

Anybody talk to the press?

Fella's name is Harold Speck, travelin' man out of Roswell.

Excuse me, a salesman gets done in his car and you call the FBI?
Excuse me, a salesman gets done in his car and you call the FBI?
Well, the victim was killed at the turn-around over there, then his car was pushed over here... ...right across the state line. That makes it Federal. This is Officer Wallace, he's out of Alamogordo.
Where's the Nuevo American Diner?
Ten miles back on the Texas side.
I hope that wasn't a joke because I can assure you, from personal experience, the FBI does not have a sense of humor.
That's right, Jan.
Nine bodies in Roswell, now this -- it's getting a little hairy, huh?
I'd appreciate it if you kept this to yourself.
I'd appreciate it if you kept this to yourself.
I know how the Feds like to sit on information. I got something in the car to show you.
Her name is Karen Sumpter, from near Dell City. Just disappeared a couple weeks back. Vanished.
You're thinking...?
You're thinking...?
Who knows.
Who knows.
This isn't in our database?
This isn't in our database?
I just assumed she ran away. Happens a lot around here. Look around. This place is an invitation to run away.
Agent Mackelway.
Mack, this is Sheriff Dylan.
Mack, this is Sheriff Dylan.
Oh Jesus, Sheriff, I am sorry. I meant to call you -- I got distracted -- the Sumpter girl was not one of Speck's victims. That's the good news.

What's the bad news?
What's the bad news?
You tell me.
You tell me.
No bad news. You know the Be On the LookOut you asked me to send on the diner car -- we got a hit on it. A little town on the border, Socorro. We got it staked out -- you interested?

I'm on my way.
Hey, Sheriff.
Down the road a piece is the Golden Sunset, the no-tell motel, Socorro's contribution to international relations. The car's just sitting there, no activity. I've had a couple Hispanic officers casing it all day. Want to take a look?

I sent a female in. The room in question was rented by an Anglo, cash; since then, nothing -- no activity, no phone response.

Let's take a look.
The room key's in the car. On the seat.
And it's getting dark. I'm not going to run this into the night. Eddie, we're walking in. Everything covered?
Show's over, boys. Nobody home.
Tape it off, we'll want to fine-tooth- comb it. My guess is that the UNSUB is having us on. He checks in, pays, picks up the key, but never walks inside. Tell me if I'm wrong.

Her body turned up. In a Minnesota cemetery. They brought her back.
You have the body?
She's buried.
She's buried.
I want the autopsy report, where is it, Minnesota?

Winona.
The family has gone through a lot. Their daughter missing, the search, her body found, the funeral -- then this order to exhume the corpse.
I'm sorry. This won't take long.
I'm sorry. This won't take long.
The body was embalmed. I don't understand --

A grill pattern.

We need to run this through VICAP, search for similar burns.
Ligature strangulation, just like his victims. A cord, nylon, you can tell by the indentation signature -- again, like his victims. Look at that little thing and look at all the trouble it got him in. Should have cut it off.
I'm not in the mood for Native American wisdom.

We had to bring staff in from the whole county to handle this.
I appreciate it, doctor. You know how it is, press screaming for answers, Washington's all over me. Ever handle a serial case?
Be my guest, Agent Kulok, scrub suits are in the back.
This is Agent Mackelway.
Ripped off. By hand, my guess. Perimortal: victim was alive at the time, there's blood on his throat.
That's the thing. Don't know if it connects, but Harold here had a thing about eyes. Two of the victims had their eyes gouged out, another punctured. Took polaroids after.
There seems to be a discrepancy.
Not a discrepancy, an error. My capacity is 5.5 tons, not 6.

You... surprised me.
Sorry. I've seen you in here. Always lugging that case around. Whatja sell?

My God.
Not bad, huh?
Not bad, huh?
You're a... you're sick.
You're a... you're sick.
What's wrong with me?
Calm down, Harold. Okay, here's what we're going to do, Harold: there's a pull off up ahead, we're going to stop there.
Oh God, mister, please leave me alone.

You're going to miss it. Pay attention.

What do you want from me?

Why me? What do you want from me!?
The man who was with him, he was a construction worker?
Yes.
Yes.
What did he look like?

I didn't wait on him. Fifty or so, white, regular build, needed a shave -- that's all I remember.

How did you know he was a construction worker?

He had an orange hat on.
He was sitting here?
It's been wiped down a hundred times since then.
There was a car in the lot when we closed. Gone today.
What kind?

An old junker. Like a reservation car. Blue, side door with brown, you know, primer paint. New Mexico plates. A Ford or ah, yeah, a Ford.

Put a BOLO out on that.
Speck's the killer all right. We got box loads of evidence. Did 'em all the same way: torture, strangulation. Prostitutes. I don't think we'll be able to write off any outstandings on him -- this is probably the full body count.
What about his killer?
What about his killer?
Nada. Vague description, that's all. Fine-tooth-combed Speck's car, the diner: no fingerprints, no trace evidence.

Let's take a look at it. Drop off my stuff at the hotel after you're done here.
He said it was a clue?
Maybe something to do with Zorro.

Just hospital talk. Nothing that connects to Speck.
Just hospital talk. Nothing that connects to Speck.
This could all be a coincidence, but, you know something, I don't believe in coincidences. That's why I came back. Do you think the UNSUB -- we're not going to mention the word Zorro -- met Harold Speck online?
Chuck, hello. This is Agent Kulok. She has a background in medical forensics.
Just an observer.
We didn't know Speck was a serial, the police didn't know, his wife didn't know -- so how did the killer know?
Maybe cause he's smart.
Maybe cause he's smart.
Smarter than us.
Sorry to interrupt you, sir, but I thought you'd like to know.
What?
What?
We have another one.

Another what?

Serial killer killed. In Ft. Myers. Cut up in his van. And this time we got a witness.
Deputy Director, get out, sir.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Please.
Mackelway, I could understand. He is over-emotional by nature, but you, Agent Kulok, you had a shining career in front of you.
Just step outside, sir. Now. Keep your hands where I can see them.
Look, sorry. Don't say a word. I know this is improper. I've been trying to speak with Deputy Director Koessler. I left a message. I must speak with you before you go back to Washington.
This better be important.
I think I talked to him.
Who?
Who?
Speck. Harold Speck.
Speck. Harold Speck.
From the grave?

Go ahead.
Agent Mackelway, you're going to get your wish. You're going back to Washington. I want you back in Computer Crimes. Fire up those chat rooms.
This time, sir, if I may be so bold, would it be possible to set up my equipment outside CIIAC, perhaps in military housing at Quantico? I didn't get along very well with the other members of the Division. We thought differently.

Mack the Mouth at a loss for words.
"Murman" was the alter identity of William Heirens, the original "Catch Me Before I Kill Again" killer. Short for "Murder Man." It was the case that got Richard Low and I started in this field.
I spoke with Lloyd Daitz.
I spoke with Lloyd Daitz.
That gasbag. I can imagine what he said. I'm not ashamed to admit that most of what I know about criminal profiling started with Richard Low. I have also, over the years, I admit, taken credit for many of his accomplishments. He was the most brilliant law enforcement individual I ever met.

"Was?"
"Was?"
We had every reason to believe he was on that plane. He was supposed to be on the plane. Everything was incinerated, it was two weeks before we reached the crash site. We, the Director and I, decided it was in everyone's best interest to declare Dick Low dead. That way he could exit a hero.

Dunlevy said there was another case, Ron Rice. In fact, there were two earlier cases where serials were murdered. The second was George Sheldon. I didn't enter it into VICAP -- I'll get you the file.

How long ago?
How long ago?
Both in the last year. I suspected only someone as brilliant as Dick Low could find these guys. Look, whatever Daitz told you, nobody wanted to strip Richard of his badge. You have to get close to be good at what he did, the trick is not to get too close.

What did you think of the Suspect Zero theory?
What did you think of the Suspect Zero theory?
It was neither a valid concept nor a valid fact. Suspect Zero came to represent every killer Dick Low had not caught. The idea took root in his head like a wild irrational vine. For someone like Low, there would always be a Suspect Zero. We couldn't let Richard go where that idea was taking him.
I got a look in Testa's computer. His screen name was "Imelda." Have to give him that, had a sense of humor.
Collected shoes too?
We're waiting for trace evidence results on the Rice killing.
We need to put out an NCIC inquiry.

I want to catch Dick Low, more than you can imagine, but I cannot risk going public. What happens when the media finds out that a former FBI Special Agent, a founder of the Behavioral Sciences Unit, is not dead, but instead alive and killing people, not ordinary people, but, even worse, serial killers, making him some sort of white knight vigilante?

Watch out for Dick Low, he's a liar; he has his own world. There was a Junior Agent in Seattle, not unlike you, an Agent who fell under Dick's spell. He'd have done anything for Agent Low. Richard got this Agent to take a suspect to the crime scene, beat him up, force a confession -- all unauthorized, all illegal. The Agent died that
I understand.
I understand.
As far as the public knows, Richard Low is dead. And he will stay dead until we kill him.
He's got you believing in Zero now too.
I need to get to Amarillo immediately.

How did a girl like me end up in a place like this? The Deputy Director here, he believes in Tough Love. A cop's cop. Shape up or ship out, righto? Agent Kulok, when you get a chance you might want to check the victims of the recent serials. You'll find that some of them have been credited to other killers, some years ago.
You are so fucked up.
Suspect Zero, now there's an idea that doesn't look good on paper --
When I was at the rest stop, there was a young boy, maybe ten, and his mother. Darryl Hawkins, Zero, abducted the boy in the men's room. I tried to stop him. He cold-cocked me --
Listen to this guy? Can you believe this? He'll never change. Born a liar, first word out of his mouth was a lie. Make up a story, always a story, any goddamn story, to save his ass.
Agent Kulok, that boy, as we speak, is in Hawkins' truck, probably still alive, in a dark refrigerated compartment, shivering in just a T- shirt: put yourself in his mind, freezing, terrified, wanting his mother. Put yourself in his mother's place, desperate, imagining the worst is happening as she pleads, back there at the rest stop, for someone, anyone, to listen to her. This
Shut the fuck up or I'll shut you up.

You have to save this boy. Good exists in this world. I can prove it because you can, in your life, save this one person.

This is a sexy case.
Yeah, you know the vic's car, he was killed this side of the state line, the car then pushed across the border. This by an Unknown Subject, presumably the killer, who left no fucking evidence except the snapshot, which may or may not have been accidental.

Setting up. Technically, anyone in a chat room can be traced back to a screen address. But, by using punters, a correspondent literally punts his address around the world, through computers in countries that have no communication treaties. The correspondent becomes "ghosted," invisible.

No, no, no, most of them -- I used to think all of them -- are just fantasists, guys who get off telling degrading stories. When I came across this fugitive chat room, listened in, I started to think some might actually be real, that they'd gone live. The challenge was to figure out which was which. Then I had my disagreement with Koessler.

No. Cut off while he was still alive, look at his wrists, damn near ripped his hands off trying to get free. Must have been screaming real loud when the killer chain-sawed his throat. Unfortunately, he'd soundproofed his van.

Did they disconnect Testa's computer?
Not yet. This time they're waiting for you.
You should have seen the store manager at Parade of Shoes. She was inconsolable.
Murman and Imelda had been slipping into a private chat room. Low had poor old Testa drooling on the keyboard. Abduction fantasies, voyeurism, mutilation, teasing him with fetish elements. He is very good. I think it's safe to say Richard Low is Murman.
Mack, I'm sorry. I apologize. I should have called. I had no right to sneak in on you like that.
No, Jaime, I apologize. I didn't... I had no right to speak to you like that.

I got an autopsy report from El Paso that doesn't seem right. A girl on Low's list. Karen Sumpter. We're getting a court order to exhume to body. I'd like you to come and look at it. Don't worry, I've cleared it.
Jaime, do you think, when this is all over, when we're in different divisions, you think maybe you and me, we could try again?
Mack, I'm just trying to keep up with now.
But why this pattern?
Could be a lot of things. Depends on the freezer. I'm sorry, Mack, but I don't think this is the answer.
