Well -- come on.
I know why you're not taken -- no one can catch up with you.

You're going to look for him -- now?

There's no time -- I'll call you in the morning.
What is it?
Open up.
I think we were wrong about Tex having the money.
Why?
Why?
I just heard from him -- he's still hungry. That means killing Gideon didn't get it for him -- so he's narrowed it down to us. You've got it.

No, it's all right. What's wrong, Adam?
Nothing's wrong. I think I found something. I was snooping around Tex's room and I found this in the waste basket. I've stuck it back together.
You're right. I remember Grandpierre looking through it. But there was nothing in it -- at least, nothing that the police thought was very important.
Can you remember anything at all?

Here's where you're to call me -- day or night. It's a direct line to both my office and my apartment. Don't lose it, Mrs. Lampert -- and please don't tell anyone about coming to see me. It could prove fatal for them as well as yourself.

Like I said, Mrs Lampert -- I'm afraid you're in a great deal of danger. Remember what happened to Charles.
I don't know who this Mr. Dyle is, but it's just possible we were wrong about who killed your husband.

By burying it, and then reporting that the Germans had captured it. All they had to do was come back after the war, dig it up and split it five ways -- a quarter of a million dollars with no questions asked.

Scobie was able to travel, but Carson Dyle was clearly dying, so they --
Carson was dying so they were forced to leave him. They finally got back to the base, made their report, and waited for the war to end. Only Charles couldn't wait quite as long as the others. He beat them back to the gold, took everything for himself and disappeared. It's taken Gideon, Tex and Scobie all this time to catch up with him

Before we start on that, do you mind handing over the stamps?
If you do anything funny, or try to talk to anyone, I'll kill you, Dyle -- here and now. Okay?
You'll wreck your raincoat.
What now?
We wait -- with our mouths shut.
How long do you intend -- ?
I said with the mouth shut.
Sorry about that.
Okay -- up there.
Do I knock or something?
Open it.
Keep going.
The view had better be worth it.
Very pretty. Now what?
I'll give you a chance, Dyle -- which is more than you'd give me. Where's the money?
I'll give you a chance, Dyle -- which is more than you'd give me. Where's the money?

You're out, Dyle -- right now!
Back where?
That's the idea.
And stop threatening that boy. He doesn't have the money. Mrs. Lampert doesn't either.
Then who does?
Then who does?
I don't know, Herman -- maybe you do.
I don't know, Herman -- maybe you do.
Me?
Me?
Or you -- Or you --
That's a crock! If one of us did that he wouldn't hang around here waiting for the other two to wise up.
But he'd have to. If he left he'd be admitting his guilt -- and the others would know what happened. Whoever it is has to wait here, pretending to look for the money, waiting for the rest of us to give up and go home. That's when he'll be safe and not a minute before.
He's just tryin' to throw us off! They've got it, I tell you! Why don't we search their rooms?
It's all right with us --
Not my room!
What's wrong, Herman -- have you got something to hide? Then I take it there are no objections.
We'd better exchange keys. Here's mine.
I'll take that.
Good morning, Mr. Dyle.
Reggie?

How can I? You lied to me -- the way Charles did -- and after promising you wouldn't. Oh, I want to believe you, Peter... oh, but I can't call you that anymore, can I? It will take me a while to get used to your new name -- which I don't even know yet. What is it? Aren't you going to tell me?
Didn't anyone ever tell you it's impolite to -- What happened?
I met a man with sharp nails.

Come on -- I've got something that stings like crazy.
Listen -- all I really want is an estimate.
It's not so bad. You may not be able to lie on your back for a few days -- but, then, you can lie from any position, can't you?
Does it hurt?
Haven't you got a bullet I can bite?
Are you really Carson Dyle's brother?

There's an old riddle about two tribes of Indians -- the Whitefeet always tell the truth and the Blackfeet always lie. So one day you meet an Indian, you ask him if he's a truthful Whitefoot or a lying Blackfoot? He tells you he's a truthful Whitefoot, but which one is he?

I don't know -- it depends on whether or not they've already eaten.
Hello, Herman, it was a happy landing, I see.
I'd better call Sylvie -- she must be frantic.
Come on -- let's get busy. Who gets your vote?
Scobie -- he's the one that objected.

Who do you think did it -- Gideon?
Maybe.

Or Tex?

No, about Scobie, I mean. I can't think of any reason why he was killed.

I usually sing a medley of old favorites when I bathe -- any requests?
Shut the door!
Shut the door!
I don't think I know that one.
The suit needs it more than I do, anyway.
How often do you go through this little ritual?
Every day. The manufacturer recommends it.
I don't believe it.

What do I have to do to satisfy you -- become the next victim?

You'd lose only twenty percent instead of seventy or eighty. He made this city.

There's going to be some irate citizens when they find out they're paying for water they're not getting.

That's all taken care of. You see, Mr. Gittes. Either you bring the water to L.A. or you bring L.A. to the water.
That's all taken care of. You see, Mr. Gittes. Either you bring the water to L.A. or you bring L.A. to the water.
How do you do that?
How do you do that?
Just incorporate the Valley into the city so the water goes to L.A. after all. It's very simple.
How much are you worth?
I have no idea. How much do you want?

I want to know what you're worth. Over ten million?

Oh, my, yes.

She's just no good.
What can I tell you, Kid? You're right. When you're right, you're right, and you're right.
What can I tell you, Kid? You're right. When you're right, you're right, and you're right.
Ain't worth thinking about.
You're absolutely right, I wouldn't give her another thought.
You know, you're okay, Mr. Gittes. I know it's your job, but you're okay.

They don't kill a guy for that.
Oh they don't?
Oh they don't?
Not for your wife. That's the unwritten law.
...No...
You bet your ass you don't. You can't even pay me off.
I'll pay the rest next trip. We only caught sixty ton of skipjack around San Benedict. We hit a chubasco, they don't pay you for skipjack the way they do for tuna or albacore.
Forget it. I only mention it to illustrate a point...
What kind of guy do you think I am?
Thanks, Mr. Gittes.
Thanks, Mr. Gittes.

I'll throw that in too.

Okay, you got yourself a boat.
Tell Mrs. Mulwray to wait for half an hour after you get there. Then if I don't show, take her down to the boat.
You sure this is okay?
You sure this is okay?
Curly, you know how long I been in business.
So there's this fella who's tired of screwing his wife.
Jake, listen.
Jake, listen.
Shut up, Duffy, you're always in a hurry and his friend says why not do what the Chinese do? So he says what do they do? His friend says the Chinese they screw for a while. Just listen a second, Duffy...
There's seven ashtrays in this room, Duffy.
Okay.
Okay.
That's a filthy habit.
That's a filthy habit.
I said okay, Jake.
I said okay, Jake.
Yeah, yeah. If she'd come in here saying she was Shirley Temple you'd say okay to that, too.
Then what'll you do?
Sue the shit out of 'em.
Yes.
I've been wanting to meet you.
I've been wanting to meet you.
Why?
Why?
Did you know that you're a very wealthy woman?

I'm not.
I'm not.
Well you own a lot of land.
Well you own a lot of land.
Not anymore. Oh, some time ago, my late husband owned a good deal of beach property in Long Beach, but we lost it.
That's just lovely.
Thank you...
Where did you get this material?
The apple core club.
The apple core club.
The apple core?

Summer colds are the worst.

Yeah, they are.
Thanks, Lou.
How'd you get past the guards?
How'd you get past the guards?
Well, to tell you the truth, I lied a little.
You've done well by yourself.
I get by.
I get by.
Well, sometimes it takes a while for a man to find himself and I guess you have.
You're behind the times, Jake. They've got steam irons now. And I'm out of Chinatown.
Since when?
Since when?
Since I made Lieutenant.
Congratulations.
Uh-huh. So what are you doing here?
Uh-huh. So what are you doing here?
Looking for someone.
Looking for someone.
Who?
Who?
Hollis Mulwray. You seen him?
Hollis Mulwray. You seen him?
Oh yes.
Oh yes.
I'd like to talk to him.
I'd like to talk to him.
You're welcome to try. There he is.
You wouldn't happen to know the present whereabouts of the young woman.
No.
No.
Or her name?
Or her name?
No.
I don't want it anymore.
No?
No?
No. It was an accident.
No. It was an accident.
You mean that's what you're going to call it.
No, he drowned a cousin of mine with about five hundred other people. But they weren't very important, just a bunch of dumb Mexicans living by a dam. Now beat it, Gittes, you don't come out of this smelling like a rose, you know.
Oh yeah? Can you think of something to charge me with?
Oh yeah? Can you think of something to charge me with?
When I do, you'll hear about it.
What are you doing here?
Didn't you call?
Didn't you call?
How do you happen to know her?
How do you happen to know her?
I don't.
I don't.
Let me show you something.
Isn't that your number?
Is it? I forget. I don't call myself that often.
Is it? I forget. I don't call myself that often.
Just to be on the safe side, we had Loach here give you a ring.
Yeah, I took 'em. So what?
How did she... ...happen to have them?
You really think I'm stupid, don't you, Gittes?
I don't think about it one way or the other. But if you want, give me a day or two, and I'll get back to you. Now I'd like to go home.
I don't think about it one way or the other. But if you want, give me a day or two, and I'll get back to you. Now I'd like to go home.
I want the rest of the pictures.
I want the rest of the pictures.
What pictures?
What pictures?
This broad hired you, Gittes, not Evelyn Mulwray.
This broad hired you, Gittes, not Evelyn Mulwray.
Yeah?
Yeah?
Yeah. Somebody wanted to shake down Mulwray, she hired you, and that's how you happen to know Mulwray was murdered.
Yeah. Somebody wanted to shake down Mulwray, she hired you, and that's how you happen to know Mulwray was murdered.
I heard it was an accident.
I heard it was an accident.
C'mon, you think you're dealing with a bunch of assholes? Mulwray had salt water in his goddam lungs! Now how did he get that... in a fresh water reservoir?
You were following him night and day. You saw who killed him. You even took pictures of it. It was Evelyn Mulwray. She's been paying you off like a slot machine ever since her husband died.
You accusing me of extortion?
You accusing me of extortion?
Absolutely.
Absolutely.
I don't think I need a day or two. You're even dumber than you think I think you are. Not only that, I'd never extort a nickel out of my worst enemy, that's where I draw the line, Escobar.
I don't think I need a day or two. You're even dumber than you think I think you are. Not only that, I'd never extort a nickel out of my worst enemy, that's where I draw the line, Escobar.
Yeah, I once knew a whore who for enough money would piss in a customer's face, but she'd never shit on his chest. That's where she drew the line.
Yeah, I once knew a whore who for enough money would piss in a customer's face, but she'd never shit on his chest. That's where she drew the line.
Well, I hope she wasn't too much of a disappointment to you, Lou.
I want those photographs, Gittes. We're talking about accessory after the fact, conspiracy, and extortion. Minimum.
Why do you think Mulwray's body was moved you dimwit? Evelyn Mulwray knocked off her husband in the ocean and thought it would look like more of an accident if she hauled him up to the Oak Pass Reservoir?
Mulwray was murdered and moved because somebody didn't want his body found in the ocean.
And why's that?
And why's that?
He found out somebody was dumping water there. That's what they were trying to cover up by moving him.
What are you talking about?
C'mon I'll show you.
It's too late.
Too late for what?
Too late for what?
They only dump the water at night.
I know what he says.
Shut up. Go on.
I don't suppose you got any idea Where she went?
Matter of fact I do.

Where?

Her maid's house. I think she knows something's up.

Tell us about it on the way to Pedro.
That's it?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, let's go.
Well, let's go.
Do me a favor, will you, Lou?
You never learn, do you, Gittes?
I guess not.
I guess not.
Give you three minutes.
Give you three minutes.
Gee, thanks, Lou.
Mrs. Mulwray, you don't want to run around like that.
Oh, Christ. Escobar, you don't know what's going on. Let her go. I'll explain it later.
Oh, Christ. Escobar, you don't know what's going on. Let her go. I'll explain it later.
Mrs. Mulwray, it's a very serious offense pointing that at an officer of the law. It's a felony.

Let her go. She didn't kill anybody.

I'm sorry, Mrs. Mulwray.

Lou, she will kill you. Let her go for now. You don't know.
Lou, she will kill you. Let her go for now. You don't know.
Gittes, stay outta this.
Who is he, get his name? I'll kill him.
Take it easy, take it easy, it was an accident.
Take it easy, take it easy, it was an accident.
An accident?
Get him away from her. He's responsible for everything. Get him away from her!
Jake, you're very disturbed. You're crazy. That's her father.
It looks like he was washed the entire length of the runoff channel. Could he swim?
Of course.
Of course.
Obviously the fall must have knocked him out.
...Well, it didn't make him happy...
But there is no possibility he would have taken his own life?
But there is no possibility he would have taken his own life?
No.
No.
Mrs. Mulwray, do you happen to know the name of the young woman in question?
No.
Do you know where she might be?
Do you know where she might be?
Certainly not!
You and your husband never discussed her?
He... we did... he wouldn't tell me her name. We quarreled over her... of course. It came as a complete surprise to me.
He... we did... he wouldn't tell me her name. We quarreled over her... of course. It came as a complete surprise to me.

Yes.

But I thought you'd hired a private investigator.
But I thought you'd hired a private investigator.
A private investigator?
A private investigator?
Mr. Gittes.
Mr. Gittes.
Well yes.
Will you need me for anything else, Lieutenant?
I don't think so, Mrs. Mulwray. Of course you have my deepest sympathy and if we need anymore information, we'll be in touch.
Not that Mulwray?
Yes, that Mulwray, Mr. Gittes. And since you agree with me we've never met, you must also agree that I haven't hired you to do anything. Certainly not spy on my husband. I see you like publicity, Mr. Gittes. Well, you're going to get it.
Yes, that Mulwray, Mr. Gittes. And since you agree with me we've never met, you must also agree that I haven't hired you to do anything. Certainly not spy on my husband. I see you like publicity, Mr. Gittes. Well, you're going to get it.
Now wait a minute, Mrs. Mulwray...
Would you like something to drink?
What are you having?
What are you having?
Iced tea.
Iced tea.
Yeah. Fine, thank you.
My husband's at the office.
Actually he's not. And he's moved from his apartment at the El Macando.
Actually he's not. And he's moved from his apartment at the El Macando.
That's not his apartment.
That's not his apartment.
Anyway... I... the point is, Mrs. Mulwray. I'm not in business to be loved, but I am in business, and believe me, whoever set up your husband, set me up. L.A.'s a small town, people talk.
I'm just trying to make a living, and I don't want to become a local Joke.
Mr. Gittes, you've talked me into it. I'll drop the lawsuit.
Mr. Gittes, you've talked me into it. I'll drop the lawsuit.
What?
What?
I said I'll drop it.
So let's just drop the whole thing. Sugar? Lemon?
Mrs. Mulwray?
Mrs. Mulwray?
Yes, Mr. Gittes?
Yes, Mr. Gittes?
I don't want to drop it.
I should talk this over with your husband.
Why?... What on earth for? Look, Hollis seems to think you're an innocent man.
Why?... What on earth for? Look, Hollis seems to think you're an innocent man.
Well, I've been accused of many things, Mrs. Mulwray, but never that.
You see, somebody went to a lot of trouble here, and I want to find out, lawsuit or no lawsuit. I'm not the one who's supposed to be caught with my pants down... so I'd like to see your husband. Unless that's a problem.
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
May I speak frankly, Mrs. Mulwray?
May I speak frankly, Mrs. Mulwray?
You may if you can, Mr. Gittes.
You may if you can, Mr. Gittes.
Well, that little girlfriend, she was attractive in a cheap sort of way of course. She's disappeared. Maybe they disappeared together somewhere.

It's very personal. It couldn't be more personal. Is this a business or an obsession with you?
It's very personal. It couldn't be more personal. Is this a business or an obsession with you?
Look at it this way. Now this phony broad, excuse the language, says she's you, she's hired me. Whoever put her up to it, didn't have anything against me. They were out to get your husband. Now if I see him, I can help him. Did you talk this morning?
No. I went riding rather early.
Looks like you went quite a distance.
Looks like you went quite a distance.
No, Just riding bareback, that's all. Anyway, you might try the Oak Pass or Stone Canyon Reservoirs. Sometimes at lunch Hollis takes walks around them. Otherwise he'll be home by 6:30.

You left your keys in the ignition.

Oh... thank you.
Thank you for going along with me. I just didn't want to explain anything... I'll send you a check.
A check?
I got your check in the mall.
Yes. As I said, I was very grateful.
Mrs. Mulwray, I'm afraid that's not good enough.
Well, how much would you like?
Well, how much would you like?
Stop it. The money's fine. It's generous but you've shortchanged me on the story.
Stop it. The money's fine. It's generous but you've shortchanged me on the story.

I think so. Something besides your husband's death was bothering you. You were upset but not that upset.
I think so. Something besides your husband's death was bothering you. You were upset but not that upset.
Mr. Gittes... Don't tell me how I feel.
Sorry. Look, you sue me, your husband dies, you drop the lawsuit like a hot potato, and all of it quicker than wind from a duck's ass. Excuse me. Then you ask me to lie to the police.
It wasn't much of a lie.
It wasn't much of a lie.
If your husband was killed it was. This can look like you paid me off to withhold evidence.
If your husband was killed it was. This can look like you paid me off to withhold evidence.
But he wasn't killed.
Well, I suppose I am... actually I knew about the affair.
How did you find out?
How did you find out?
My husband.
My husband.
He told you?
And you weren't the slightest bit upset about it?
I was grateful.
You'll have to explain that, Mrs. Mulwray.
Why?
Why?
Look, I do matrimonial work, It's my metiay. When a wife tells me she's happy her husband is cheating on her it runs contrary to my experience.
Unless what?
She's cheating on him.
I don't like the word 'cheat.'
Did you have affairs?
Did you have affairs?
Mr. Gittes.
Mr. Gittes.
Did he know?

You were seeing someone, too.
For very long?
I don't see anyone for very long, Mr. Gittes. It's difficult for me. Now I think you know all you need to about me. I didn't want publicity. I didn't want to go into any of this, then or now. Is this all?
K... Cross.
That your maiden name?
That your maiden name?
Yes... why?
Yes... why?
No reason.
You must've had a reason to ask me that.
No. I'm just a snoop.

You seem to have had a reason for every other question.

Whoever's behind my husband's death, why have they gone to all this trouble?
Money. How they plan to make it by emptying the reservoirs, that I don't know.
Money. How they plan to make it by emptying the reservoirs, that I don't know.
I'll pay your salary plus five thousand dollars if you find out what happened to Hollis and who is involved.
Your father is Julian Cross, isn't he?
Yes, of course. It was quite a while after. I was just out of grade school when they did that.
Yes, of course. It was quite a while after. I was just out of grade school when they did that.
So you married your father's business partner?
You've got one going, Mrs. Mulwray.
Oh.
Is there something upsetting about my asking about your father?
No!... Yes, a little. You see Hollis and my fa... my father had a falling out...
No!... Yes, a little. You see Hollis and my fa... my father had a falling out...
Over the water department, or over you?

Not over me. Why would they have a falling out over me?
Not over me. Why would they have a falling out over me?
Then it was over the water department.
Then it was over the water department.
Not exactly. Well, I mean, yes. Yes and no. Hollis felt the public should own the water but I don't think my father felt that way. Actually, it was over the Van der Lip. The dam that broke.

Of course I'm sure.
Of course I'm sure.
What about you? Do you and your father get along?
What are you thinking?
Before this I turned on the faucet, it came out hot and cold, I didn't think there was a thing to it.
That dam is a con job.
What dam?
What dam?
The one your husband opposed. They're conning L.A. into building it, only the water won't go to L.A. It'll go here.

Know him?
Know him?
No, I think I'd remember.
No, I think I'd remember.
Yeah. They've been blowing these farmers out of here and buying their land for peanuts. Have any idea what this land'll be worth with a steady water supply? About thirty million more than they paid.

They can't be.

Get in the car.

What's that, Mrs. Mulwray?
What's that, Mrs. Mulwray?
Well, I'm only judging on the basis of one afternoon and an evening, but if that's how you go about your work, I'd say you're lucky to get through a whole day.

You're insane.
Just tell me the truth. I'm not the police. I don't care what you've done. I'm not going to hurt you, but one way or another I'm going to know.
You won't go to the police if I tell you?
You won't go to the police if I tell you?
I will if you don't.
I can't...
Because of Hollis? Because she was seeing your husband? Was that it? Jesus Christ, say something. Was that it?
I took your husband's Buick... I'll return it tomorrow.
Aren't you coming back with me?

Don't worry. I'm not telling anybody about this.

What are you saying?
What are you saying?
There's no time for you to be shocked by the truth, Mrs. Mulwray. The coroner's report proves he was killed in salt water. Just take my word for it. Now I want to know how it happened and why. I want to know before Escobar gets here because I want to hang onto my license.

I don't know what you're talking about. This is the most insane... the craziest thing I ever...
Stop it! I'll make it easy. You were jealous, you fought, he fell, hit his head. It was an accident, but his girl is a witness. You've had to pay her off. You don't have the stomach to harm her, but you've got the money to shut her up. Yes or no?
...no...
...no...
Who is she? And don't give me that crap about it being your sister. You don't have a sister.
That's good. Now what's her name?
Katherine.
Katherine.
Katherine?... Katherine who?
Katherine?... Katherine who?
She's my daughter.
I said the truth!
She's my sister.
I said I want the truth.
She's my sister and my daughter!
...he had a breakdown... the dam broke... my mother died... he became a little boy... I was fifteen... he'd ask me what to eat for breakfast, what clothes to wear!... It happened... then I ran away...
To Mexico...
Hollis came and took... care of me... after she was born... he said... he took care of her... I couldn't see her... I wanted to but I couldn't... I just want to see her once in a while... take care of her... that's all... but I don't want her to know... I don't want her to know...
...so that's why you hate him...
Yeah... where are you taking her now?
Back to Mexico.

I was the one who pretended to be Mrs. Mulwray, remember?
Shut the fuck up! ...Yes I remember nothing, Miss Sessions, just going over a detail or two with my associates... you were saying?
Well I never expected anything to happen like what happened to Mr. Mulwray, the point is if it ever comes out I want somebody to know I didn't know what would happen.

Do you accept anyone of the Jewish persuasion?
I'm sorry. We don't.
Don't be sorry, neither does Dad. Wanted to make sure though, didn't we, honey?
Just to be certain, I wonder if you could show us a list of your patients?
We don't reveal the names of our guests as a matter of policy. I know you'd appreciate that if your father came to live with us.
That's exactly what we wanted to hear.
Oh, good.
Oh, good.
I wonder, is it too late for us to have a look around?

J.J. Gittes. And it's not a departmental matter.
I wonder if you'd care to wait in my office?
After all, you work with a man for a certain length of time, you come to know him, his habits, his values, and so forth. Well either he's the kind who chases after women or he isn't.
And Mulwray isn't?
And Mulwray isn't?
He never even kids about it.

Maybe he takes it very seriously.

I'm sorry, I --

Well, tell him I'll be back.
Mind if I take one of your cards? In case I want to get in touch with you again.
Help yourself.
Relax, Mulvihill, glad to see you. Do you know Claude Mulvihill here?
Hope so. He's working for us.

Mr. Gittes, you're not making a bit of sense.
Mr. Gittes, you're not making a bit of sense.
Well, look at it this way, Mr. Yelburton. Mulwray didn't want to build a dam and he had a reputation that was hard to get around, so. you decided to ruin it. Then he found out that you were dumping water every night. Then he was drowned.

Well, Whitey Mehrholtz over at the Times will. Dumping thousands of gallons of water down the toilet in the middle of a drought. That's news.
Wait. Please sit down, Mr. Gittes. We're... well, we're not anxious for this to get around, but we have been diverting a little water to irrigate avocado and walnut groves in the northwest valley. As you know, the farmers there have no legal right to our water, and since the drought we've had to cut them off. The city comes first, naturally. But, well,
Yeah, a little runoff. Where are those orchards?
Yeah, a little runoff. Where are those orchards?
I said, the northwest valley.

I don't want to nail you. I just want to know who put you up to it. I'll give you a few days to think it over. Call me. I can help. Who knows? Maybe we can lay the whole thing off on a few big shots and you can stay head of the department for the next twenty years.

No, really?
I'm afraid so.

She must be about thirty-three, thirty- four.
You must be thinking of a different daughter.

No, he's only got one, I remember her age, I read it in the newspapers when she ran away.
No, he's only got one, I remember her age, I read it in the newspapers when she ran away.
She ran away?
She ran away?
Oh yeah, it was a big thing at the time. Julian Cross' daughter. God almighty. She was a wild little thing.
Course, she settled down nicely.
Well, you never know, do you?
Well, you never know, do you?
That's for sure.
That's for sure.
Why'd she run away?
Why'd she run away?
Oh, you know. She was sixteen or seventeen.
Oh, you know. She was sixteen or seventeen.
We missed the best of it, didn't we, pal?
She ran off to Mexico. Rumor was she was knocked up and didn't even know who the father was. Went there to get rid of it.
You don't say?
You don't say?
Cross was looking for her all over the country. Offered rewards, everything. Felt real sorry for him, with all his money.
You must not come here! How many times do I have to tell you? If the film catches fire, runt that you are, you'd go up in a burst of flame...whoosh! And turn into a piece of...
...and turn into a piece of charcoal!!
'Cause sometimes you can't find the right place any more and so...well, actually...they stay here. Besides, there are more kisses than you can count.
So I can have these?
So I can have these?
Look, Toto! Before I kick your ass all the way to China and back, let's make a deal. These strips here are yours, I give them to you. However! One you're not to stick your nose in here any more. Two I'll keep them for you, because you can't take them home for God forbid and save our souls, if they catch fire, all
What are you doing here?
I bought a ticket. I've come to see the film.
Signora Maria, don't do that. He's just a kid. And why are you telling fibs? We let him in free. He must have lost the money inside the movie theatre... How much did you have?
Fifty lire...
Fifty lire...
What you find tonight on the floor between the seats?
Alfredo, did you know my father?
Of course I knew your father. He was tall, thin, pleasant, and had a moustache like mine. Always smiling. He looked like Clark Gable.
'I choose my friends for their looks, and my enemies for their brains...' You're too smart to be my friend. Besides, as I always tell my kids, be careful to pick the right friends!
But you don't have any kids!!!
But you don't have any kids!!!
All right, all right! When I've got kids that's what I'm telling them!
I told my mother you weren't the one who gave me the films. That it wasn't your fault. But I thought you said the film could catch fire just to scare me. Now that I know, I won't steal any more from you. That's all I wanted to say. I'm going.
Toto, come here.
Now listen to what I've got to say. I took up this profession when I was ten years old. In those days there weren't these modern machines. The films were silent. The projectors were run by hand, like this, with a crank. And you wound the crank all day long. It was really rough going! If you got tired and slowed down' boom! Everything
Then why don't you want to teach it to me too? Now that there's no more cranking, and it's easier?
Then why don't you want to teach it to me too? Now that there's no more cranking, and it's easier?
Because I don't want to, Toto! This is not a job for you. It's like being a slave. You're always alone. You see the same film over and over again, because you have nothing else to do. And you start talking to Greta Garbo and Tyrone Power like a nut! You work on holidays, on Christmas, on Easter. Only on Good Friday are you

Then why don't you change jobs?
Then why don't you change jobs?
Because I'm an idiot. How many other guys in town know how to be a projectionist? None! Only a jerk like me could do it. Besides I wasn't lucky. When I was a kid there was the war! When I grew up, another war! Now it's all different. Times have changed. And you want to be a dope like me? Huh? Answer me!

No...
No...
Good for you, Toto. Good for you... I'm only saying this for your own good... Cooped up in here you die of heat in the summer and of cold in the winter. You breathe in smoke, gas fumes, and earn practically nothing.

But don't you like anything about what you do?
But don't you like anything about what you do?
With time...you get used to it. Besides, when you hear from up here that there's a full house and that people are laughing, having fun... Then you're happy too. So I've been wasting my breath? You pretend to agree with me, but as soon as my back is turned, you do what you want! Get out of here! I don't want to lay eyes

Alfredo, go fuck yourself!!!
You understand which side the gelatin's on?
It tastes wonderful!
Will they really find work in Germany?
Who knows?...It's like an adventure. Hope springs eternal...
Who knows?...It's like an adventure. Hope springs eternal...
Peppinoooo! Come back sooon!! Good thing Germany's closer than Russia.
It's got to be sent to another town. And if we don't the owner of that movie house gets pissed off.
Too bad!
Any room for me in this Cinema Paradiso?
Come in, Alfredo.
How's school?
OK. OK. But now that I've got a job, I'11 probably stop going...
OK. OK. But now that I've got a job, I'11 probably stop going...
Don't do that...Sooner or later you'll be left empty-handed.
Don't do that...Sooner or later you'll be left empty-handed.
Why? What do you mean?
Why? What do you mean?
Toto, this isn't for you. For the moment, the Cinema Paradiso needs you, and you need the Cinema Paradiso. But it won't last...Some day you'll have other things to do, more important things... That's right, more important. I know it. Now that I've lost my sight I see more. I see everything I didn't see before... And it's all thanks to you, who saved
Yes. I want proof.
For example, at this moment the film's out of focus. Go see.
What'd I tell you? It doesn't catch fire!
Progress! It always arrives too late!
Chaplin's Modern Times! Right, Toto?
That's right, Modern Times.
That's right, Modern Times.
I've shown it so many times I know it by heart. The first time I showed it, in 1940, was the Sunday my first wife died. They kept it hidden from me all day so they wouldn't have to close down the movie house. I only found out that night, after the last show. Those are things you never forget... So, Toto, how are

Yes.
Yes.
What is it, what is it? What's the picture?
What is it, what is it? What's the picture?
It's people in the slaughter-house killing a calf. There's blood all over the floor, like a lake. And through this lake another calf passes by on its way to die.
Now what can you see?
Nothing, there's nothing. It's all out of focus.
Nothing, there's nothing. It's all out of focus.
Is there a woman?...Tell me the truth... There is a woman.
Yes, it's a girl I saw at the station.
What's she like? What's she like?...
Eh! Love...what a mystery! I understand you, Toto...The ones with blue eyes are the most beautiful. Whatever you do, you can't make friends with them. Eh, there's nothing to be done about it! The heavier a man is, the deeper his footprints. And if he's in love, he suffers, because he knows he's up a one-way street. Because love is a meaningless thing when
What you say is wonderful! But sad...
What you say is wonderful! But sad...
They're not my words. John Wayne said it in Shepherd of the Hills.
I told you, the blue-eyed ones are the most difficult.
But why? There must be some way to make her understand!
But why? There must be some way to make her understand!
Don't think about it, Toto. Don't even try. With feelings, there's nothing to understand.
Stop it! I've had enough of your sermons! You act as if you created the world!
Heeey! Totooooo! Don't get pissed off with me now! Come here! I don't know where the fuck I have to go. And the next time be careful how you talk. Not to take credit away from the Lord, but if I had created the world, in all modesty, certain things would have come out better. But unfortunately such was not the case.

You see, it s like I say. You always have an answer for everything.
You see, it s like I say. You always have an answer for everything.
I want to make you happy, Toto! I'm going to tell you a story. Once upon a time a king gave a feast and there were all the most beautiful princesses of the realm. Basta, one of the guards, saw the king's daughter: she was the loveliest of all! And he immediately fell in love with her. But what could a poor soldier do

No! You mean right at the end? ALFREDO That's right, Toto, right at the end? And don't ask me what it means. If you figure it out, let me know...
Toto, are you pulling my leg or something? How is it possible to see this television without film?
Just so, Alfredo. There isn't any. And if you buy a television set, you can watch it at home, without any fuss...
Just so, Alfredo. There isn't any. And if you buy a television set, you can watch it at home, without any fuss...
Could be...But I don't like this business. It smells fishy to me.
You weren't expecting me?
No, Alfredo, I was coming to help you...
No, Alfredo, I was coming to help you...
You were expecting her? Huh? ...It's a nasty business waiting by yourself. In company it's better. No?...Then I'll leave.
But where'd you go, Toto?!!
I'm here! Take it easy! Take it easy! Sit down, sit down... Did she come?
I'm here! Take it easy! Take it easy! Sit down, sit down... Did she come?
No, nobody came.
You 're thinner...You can tell you've not been treated well. .
They tell me you never go out, never talk to anybody. Why?
They tell me you never go out, never talk to anybody. Why?
Toto, sooner or later there comes a time when talking or keeping quiet is the same thing. So it's better to shut up. It's hot in here. Toto, take me to the beach.
Did you ever see her again?
No. And nobody knows where she is.
No. And nobody knows where she is.
It was probably meant to be like this. Each of us has a star to follow. So now what are you thinking of doing?
Listen to this one...The commander says to the sergeant: 'You remember that windmill that used to be there?' 'Yes, sir, I remember the mill's gone but the wind's still there!' You remember the story of the soldier and the princess?
Now I understand why the soldier went away just before the end. That's right, just one more night and the princess would have been his. But she, also, could not have kept her promise. And...that would have been terrible, he would have died from it. So instead, for ninety-nine nights at least he had lived with the illusion that she was there waiting for

Do like the soldier, Toto! Go away! This land is cursed. When you're here every day you feel like you're at the center of the universe, it seems like nothing ever changes. Then you go away, one year, two...And when you come back, everything's different. The thread has broken. You don't find those you were looking for, your things no longer exist. Isn't that

Who said that? Gary Cooper, James Stewart, Henry Fonda? Huh?
Who said that? Gary Cooper, James Stewart, Henry Fonda? Huh?
No, Toto, nobody said it. I say it! Life's not like you saw it in the movies. Life...is harder. Get out! Go back to Rome. You 're young, the world is yours! And I'm old...I don't want to hear you talk any more, I want to hear talk about you.
Thanks for all you've done for me.
Whatever you do, love it like you loved that projection booth of the Paradiso when you were little...
Good morning, father. It's hard on the feet, huh?
Yeah!...Getting there's downhill and all the saints help you. But coming back! The saints stand there watching you, that's all! God's will be done.
What is it, Alfredo? Right now, of all times!
Father Adelfio, I have a very serious doubt that is torturing my soul. And you've got to help me, because I've lost all peace of mind...
But Alfredo, what you're saying is horrifying!
I know. But take the-miracle of the loaves and fishes, for example! I think about it a lot...How is it possible for...
You understand now? You see it clearly?
Oh yes, father. Now everything's clear.
Oh yes, father. Now everything's clear.
And the next time don't go around saying such heresy. You survived the fire at the movie house. But no one can save you from the fire of Hell!
My name's Salvatore...And yours?
Elena. My name's Elena.
Hi, Elena!
Hi. Why are you running?
Hi. Why are you running?
No particular reason... Nice day, huh?
No particular reason... Nice day, huh?
Yes, nice day. ...I've got to go now. Bye-bye.
Yes, nice day. ...I've got to go now. Bye-bye.
Bye-bye, Elena. ...What an idiot! What an idiot! 'Nice day'! Christ!!
Father, I have sinned...
We'll talk about that later.
We'll talk about that later.
But...who...
But...who...
Sssssh, Be quiet, pretend everything's normal. I'm Salvatore.
I don't care. I'll wait.
For what?
For what?
For you to fall in love with me too. Listen carefully. Every night, when I get off work, I'll come and wait beneath your window. Every night. When you change your mind, open your window. That's all. I'll understand...
You have a great future as a driver. If they don't arrest you first!!
That's nothing to do with it, it's the car that's still being run in...
Elena!...But when...
I got back today. You can't imagine the excuses I had to make up to be here...
So what'd they say?
The army says that, as a war orphan, I don't have to serve in the military, but nothing can be done. It's a bureaucratic error. I have to leave. Day after tomorrow morning. They're sending me to Rome. But they'll discharge me ten days later. Let's go...
No, Salvatore. You'd better go. It's my father.
Good, this way we can finally talk. I'll convince him this time.
Good, this way we can finally talk. I'll convince him this time.
He won't be convinced, Salvatore. He has other plans for me.
He won't be convinced, Salvatore. He has other plans for me.
Who?
Who?
The son of one of his colleagues. Don't act that way. We'll talk about it later. Wait for me Thursday at the Cinema Paradiso. I'll be coming with the five o'clock bus.
You're still beautiful...
Don't be silly...I'm old. Don't look at me like that, please. Why'd you come back?
Don't be silly...I'm old. Don't look at me like that, please. Why'd you come back?
Alfredo died. Do you remember him?
Alfredo died. Do you remember him?
Of course I remember him. I'm sorry. You were terribly fond of him.
I saw your daughter. She's beautiful! Who knows how many Salvatores must be running after her...
One or two. Bur there're not all that many Salvatores. I've got a son, too...he's older. And you, do you have children?
One or two. Bur there're not all that many Salvatores. I've got a son, too...he's older. And you, do you have children?
No. And I'm not married. Are you happy?
No. And I'm not married. Are you happy?
All things considered, yes. Even if it wasn't what I dreamt of then...
My husband...you know him.
Sure, sure! Boccia... What's he do?
Sure, sure! Boccia... What's he do?
Politics. He's the district representative. We met at the University in Pisa.
But I've never forgotten you, Elena!
Nor have I. Even though you disappeared... But what's the point of talking about it? We risk being pathetic and ridiculous. You still live in Rome?
It's the first time I've had to chance to tell the story. I never mentioned it to anybody.
Alfredo, damn him! He cast his spell on you too!
Alfredo, damn him! He cast his spell on you too!
I told him I'd take his advice. But before I went away I left you that note... I was on my way down the stairs...
Oh, how I looked for you, Elena! You'll never know. I wrote, telephoned, nothing. Nobody ever answered. But I dreamt of you for years! That's why I went away...and never came back here. Even as the years passed, in all the women I met, I was only looking for you. I had success it's true, but there was always something missing... I'd never have
He wasn't crazy. In the beginning I was upset. I think I really hated him. But then, with time, I understood what he said...and your silence too.
But I never saw that note! I must have covered it with my hand, without realizing it, that's the only explanation...
What difference does it make to find an explanation? That's the way it went. But Alfredo didn't betray you, he was the only one who really understood you. Salvatore, if you had chosen to be with me, you'd have never made your films. And that would have been a pity! Because they're wonderful, I've seen them all. But you shouldn't have gone and changed
No, Salvatore...there is no future. There's only the past. Even meeting last night was nothing but a dream, a beautiful dream. We never did it when we were kids, remember? Now that it's happened, I don't think there could have been a better ending.
I'll never agree with you. Never, Elena.
I don't remember him any moreMa, where's Russia?
It takes years to get there. And years to come back...Now go to bed, Toto, it's late.
I've been looking for you all day. Did you buy the milk?
No...
No...
Then where's the money?
Then where's the money?
Somebody stole it.
Daddy's not coming back...He's dead.
It's not true! No! It's not true!!! I'll show you he's coming back!
Lia'll be so glad to see you, you'll see. And you won't recognize the kids any more, they're grown up by now.
They're always writing to me saying they want to come to Rome!
See how pretty the house is? We did everything over. If it hadn't been for you! Come, I have a surprise.... You must be tired. If you want to rest, there's time before the funeral.
No, Mamma, it only takes an hour by air, you know.
No, Mamma, it only takes an hour by air, you know.
You shouldn't tell me that now. After all these years! I put all your things in here. Go in, go in...
No...It's nothing to do with you. It's just that I was scared of coming back. Now, after all these years, I thought I was strong, that I had forgotten lots of things. Instead, I find it's quite the opposite, as if I had never left. And yet, I look at Lia and feel as if I didn't know her, and you, Mamma...I abandoned you,
And I never asked for one! You have nothing to explain. I always thought that what you did was right, and that was that. With no beating around the bush... Only one thing made me suffer: bolting the door shut before going to bed at night...
And I never asked for one! You have nothing to explain. I always thought that what you did was right, and that was that. With no beating around the bush... Only one thing made me suffer: bolting the door shut before going to bed at night...
You never used to do that!
Don Ciccio, I've got an idea...You remember that old abandoned movie house where they're supposed to build those low-rent houses?
So what's that got to do with it?
So what's that got to do with it?
The projector's all rusty, but I could fix it in two or three days. Give the place a good cleaning, put in some seats and bring in a projectionist and we'll show Catene in two houses.

What the fuck you talking about? You getting into the act too, Toto? Titanus has trouble giving me even one copy and I have to say thanks! If I ask for two, the least they'll do is cut off my head and play ball with it!
Toto, this is no film for the common herd. One day'll be more than enough...So tonight, please set up tomorrow's film, so the projectionist who is coming will find it ready.
OK...
How long's it been shut?
Six years ago this May. No one came any more. You "know better than me, Mr. Di Vita, the crisis, television, videos. By now the movie business is only a dream. The city's bought it now to make a new parking lot. Next Saturday they're tearing it down...A pity!...
But why do you call me 'Mr. Di Vita'? It didn't used to be that way...
Well, it's hard to call an important person by his first name. But if it really matters to you, I'11 call you... Toto!...
Mr. Bernstein, Mr. Thatcher -
How are you, Mr. Thatcher?
That's all right. We have no secrets from our readers. Mr. Thatcher is one of our most devoted readers, Mr. Bernstein. He knows what's wrong with every issue since I've taken charge. What's the cable?
The food is marvelous in Cuba the senoritas are beautiful stop I could send you prose poems of palm trees and sunrises and tropical colors blending in far off landscapes but don't feel right in spending your money for this stop there's no war in Cuba regards Wheeler.
That's fine, Mr. Kane.
I rather like it myself. Send it right away.
He sure did, Mr. Kane.
Where is he?
Mr. Kane -
That's all right, Mr. Bernstein.
Hey, Brad! Brad! He ain't been drinking before, Mr. Kane. Never. We would have heard.
What does it say there?
"Miss Susan Alexander, a pretty but hopelessly incompetent amateur - - last night opened the new Chicago Opera House in a performance of - of -" I can't pronounce that name, Mr. Kane.
Thais.
"Her singing, happily, is no concern of this department. Of her acting, it is absolutely impossible to..."
Go on!
Go on!
That's all there is.
Of her acting, it is absolutely impossible to say anything except that it represents a new low... Have you got that, Mr. Bernstein? In the opinion of this reviewer -
I didn't see that.
I didn't see that.
It isn't here, Mr. Bernstein. I'm dictating it.
It isn't here, Mr. Bernstein. I'm dictating it.
I can't take shorthand.
I can't take shorthand.
Get me a typewriter. I'll finish the notice.
I've just made a shocking discovery. The "Enquirer" is without a telephone. Have two installed at once!
I ordered six already this morning! Got a discount!
Three cents.
Two cents.
This is all figured at three cents a copy.
Re-figure it, Mr. Bernstein, at two cents.
Re-figure it, Mr. Bernstein, at two cents.
All right, but I'll keep these figures, too, just in case.
All right, but I'll keep these figures, too, just in case.
Ready for dinner, Brad?
Ready for dinner, Brad?
Mr. Leland, if Mr. Kane, he should decide to drop the price to one cent, or maybe even he should make up his mind to give the paper away with a half-pound of tea - you'll just hold him until I get back, won't you?
It's a saying, Mr. Bernstein. A new broom sweeps clean.
Oh!
My Declaration of Principles - Don't smile, Brad - Take dictation, Mr. Bernstein -
I can't take shorthand, Mr. Kane -
I can't take shorthand, Mr. Kane -
I'll write it myself.
You don't wanta make any promises, Mr. Kane, you don't wanta keep.
These'll be kept. I'll provide the people of this city with a daily paper that will tell all the news honestly. I will also provide them -
Let's hope they like it there.
From the Chronicle Building that sign is the biggest thing you can see - every floor guaranteed - let's hope it bothers them - it cost us enough.
From the Chronicle Building that sign is the biggest thing you can see - every floor guaranteed - let's hope it bothers them - it cost us enough.
Look at that.
Say, with them fellows - - it's no trick to get circulation.
You're right, Mr. Bernstein.
You're right, Mr. Bernstein.
You know how long it took the "Chronicle" to get that staff together? Twenty years.
You know how long it took the "Chronicle" to get that staff together? Twenty years.
I know.
Gentlemen of the "Enquirer"! This has, I think, been a fitting welcome to those distinguished journalists - Mr. Reilly in particular - who are the latest additions to our ranks. It will make them happy to learn that the "Enquirer's" circulation this morning passed the two hundred thousand mark.
Two hundred and one thousand, six hundred and forty-seven.
But please, Mr. Kane, don't buy any more paintings. Nine Venuses already we got, twenty-six Virgins - two whole warehouses full of stuff -
I promise not to bring any more Venuses and not to worry - and not to try to get in touch with any of the papers -
Ask them to sit down, Mr. Bernstein.
Sit down, everybody - for heaven's sake!
So then, tonight, we go over everything thoroughly, eh? Especially the new papers -
We certainly do. Vacation's over - starting right after dinner. But right now - that lady over there - - that's the new society editor, I take it? You think I could interrupt her a moment, Mr. Bernstein?
We certainly do. Vacation's over - starting right after dinner. But right now - that lady over there - - that's the new society editor, I take it? You think I could interrupt her a moment, Mr. Bernstein?
Huh? Oh, I forgot - you've been away so long I forgot about your joking -
It's wonderful, Mr. Kane. Wonderful. Wonderful.
You don't really think so?
You don't really think so?
I do. I do. I mean, since you're running for Governor - and you want to be elected - I think it's wonderful you're going to be elected. Only - - Can I say something?
I do. I do. I mean, since you're running for Governor - and you want to be elected - I think it's wonderful you're going to be elected. Only - - Can I say something?
Please, Mr. Bernstein.
Please, Mr. Bernstein.
Well, the way I look at it - - You want to know what I really think would be wonderful?
Go in and ask him to hurry.
Well, why don't you, Mr. Bernstein? You know Mr. Leland.
Well, why don't you, Mr. Bernstein? You know Mr. Leland.
I might make him nervous.
I might make him nervous.
You and Leland and Mr. Kane - you were great friends back in the old days, I understand.
You and Leland and Mr. Kane - you were great friends back in the old days, I understand.
That's right. They called us the "Three Musketeers."
He's a great guy - Leland. Why'd he ever leave New York?
That's a long story.
Yes. I thought it was a good idea. We've covered it from the news end, of course.
And the social. How about the music notice? You got that in?

Oh, yes, it's already made up. Our Mr. Mervin wrote a small review.

Yes, very! Naturally.

Well, well - isn't that nice?

Well, Mr. Bernstein, you were with Mr. Kane from the very beginning -

You're pretty young, Mr. - Mr. Thompson. A fellow will remember things you wouldn't think he'd remember. You take me. One day, back in 1896, I was crossing over to Jersey on a ferry and as we pulled out, there was another ferry pulling in - - and on it, there was a girl waiting to get off. A white dress she had on

It's not trick to make an awful lot of money if all you want is to make a lot of money. Thatcher!
He finished it. He wrote the worst notice I ever read about the girl he loved. We ran it in every paper.
I guess Mr. Kane didn't think so well of Susie's art anyway.
I guess Mr. Kane didn't think so well of Susie's art anyway.
He thought she was great, Mr. Thompson. He really believed that. He put all his ambition on that girl. After she came along, he never really cared for himself like he used to. Oh, I don't blame Susie -

Well, then, how could he write that roast? The notices in the Kane papers were always very kind to her.
Well, then, how could he write that roast? The notices in the Kane papers were always very kind to her.
Oh, yes. He saw to that. I tell you, Mr. Thompson, he was a hard man to figure out. He had that funny sense of humor. And then, too, maybe he thought by finishing that piece he could show Leland he was an honest man. You see, Leland didn't think so. I guess he showed him all right. He's a nice fellow, but he's
The way things turned out, I don't need to tell you - Miss Emily Norton was no rosebud!
It didn't end very well, did it?
It didn't end very well, did it?
It ended - Then there was Susie - that ended, too. I guess he didn't make her very happy - You know, I was thinking - that Rosebud you're trying to find out about -

Maybe that was something he lost. Mr. Kane was a man that lost - almost everything he had - You ought to talk to Bradford Leland. He could tell you a lot. I wish I could tell you where Leland is, but I don't know myself. He may be out of town somewhere - he may be dead.

Just old age. It's the only disease, Mr. Thompson, you don't look forward to being cured of. You ought to see Mr. Leland. There's a whole lot of things he could tell you - if he wanted to.
I'm not guaranteeing a thing, Mr. Bernstein. You people work too fast for me! Talk about new brooms!
Who said anything about brooms?
We'll be on the street soon, Charlie - another ten minutes.
It's three hours and fifty minutes late - but we did it -
Wasted?
Charlie?!
Charlie?!
You just made the paper over four times today, Mr. Kane. That's all -
Sixty-two thousand -
That looks pretty nice.
Do you, Mr. Leland?
Certainly not.
Isn't it wonderful? Such a party!
Yes.
What's the matter?
Mr. Bernstein, these men who are now with the "Enquirer" - who were with the "Chronicle" until yesterday - weren't they just as devoted to the "Chronicle" kind of paper as they are now to - our kind of paper?
Mr. Bernstein, these men who are now with the "Enquirer" - who were with the "Chronicle" until yesterday - weren't they just as devoted to the "Chronicle" kind of paper as they are now to - our kind of paper?
Sure. They're like anybody else. They got work to do. They do it. Only they happen to be the best men in the business.
Do we stand for the same things that the "Chronicle" stands for, Mr. Bernstein?
Certainly not. So what's that got to do with it? Mr. Kane, he'll have them changed to his kind of newspapermen in a week.
Certainly not. So what's that got to do with it? Mr. Kane, he'll have them changed to his kind of newspapermen in a week.
Probably. There's always a chance, of course, that they'll change Mr. Kane - without his knowing it.
Do you, Mr. Leland?
Certainly not.
Mr. Leland, why didn't you go to Europe with him? He wanted you to. He said to me just yesterday -
I wanted him to have fun - and with me along -
Mr. Bernstein, I wish you'd let me ask you a few questions, and answer me truthfully.
Don't I always? Most of the time?
Don't I always? Most of the time?
Mr. Bernstein, am I a stuffed shirt? Am I a horse-faced hypocrite? Am I a New England school-marm?
Mr. Bernstein, am I a stuffed shirt? Am I a horse-faced hypocrite? Am I a New England school-marm?
Yes.
If you thought I'd answer different from what Mr. Kane tells you - well, I wouldn't.

Well, he'll be coming back in September. The Majestic. I got the reservations. It gets in on the ninth.
September the ninth?
What's happened?
I'm all right, Mr. Leland. Only there was some fellows out front that thought they ought to take things up with me. I learned 'em! Didn't I, officer?
If you hadn't come along and protected me when you did, I'd have killed them fellows.
Go and get yourself washed up, Mr. Bernstein. There doesn't seem to be an serious injury.
Go and get yourself washed up, Mr. Bernstein. There doesn't seem to be an serious injury.
Not to me. But you will let that cop go home with Mr. Kane, won't you?
Not to me. But you will let that cop go home with Mr. Kane, won't you?
Yes, Mr. Bernstein.
Hello, Mr. Leland.
Hello, Bernstein.
Where is it - where's my notice? I've got to finish it!
Mr. Kane is finishing it.
Mr. Kane is finishing it.
Kane? Charlie? Where is he?
I suppose he's fixing it up - I know I'd never get that through.
Mr. Kane is finishing your piece the way you started it.
Welcome, Mr. Kane, to the "Enquirer." I am Herbert Carter.
Thank you, Mr Carter. This is Mr. Leland.
Thank you, Mr Carter. This is Mr. Leland.
How do you do, Mr. Leland?

Are they standing for me?

You may resume your work, gentlemen. I didn't know your plans and so I was unable to make any preparations.
I don't my plans myself.
Mr. Carter, this is Mr. Bernstein. Mr. Bernstein is my general manager.
How do you do, Mr. Bernstein?
How do you do, Mr. Bernstein?
You've got a private office here, haven't you?
My little sanctum is at your disposal. But I don't think I understand -
I'm going to live right here. As long as I have to.
I'm going to live right here. As long as I have to.
But a morning newspaper, Mr. Kane. After all, we're practically closed twelve hours a day - except for the business offices -
But a morning newspaper, Mr. Kane. After all, we're practically closed twelve hours a day - except for the business offices -
That's one of the things I think must be changed, Mr. Carter. The news goes on for twenty-four hours a day.
I'm not criticizing, Mr. Carter, but here's what I mean. There's a front page story in the "Chronicle," and a picture - of a woman in Brooklyn who is missing. Probably murdered. A Mrs. Harry Silverstone. Why didn't the "Enquirer" have that this morning?
Because we're running a newspaper, Mr. Kane, not a scandal sheet.
I'm still hungry, Brad. Let's go to Rector's and get something decent. The "Chronicle" has a two-column headline, Mr. Carter. Why haven't we?
There is no news big enough.

If the headline is big enough, it makes the new big enough. The murder of Mrs. Harry Silverstone -
If the headline is big enough, it makes the new big enough. The murder of Mrs. Harry Silverstone -
As a matter of fact, we sent a man to the Silverstone home yesterday afternoon. Our man even arrived before the "Chronicle" reporter. And there's no proof that the woman was murdered - or even that she's dead.

That's the kind of thing we are going to be interested in from now on, Mr. Carter. Right now, I wish you'd send your best man up to see Mr. Silverstone. Have him tell Mr. Silverstone if he doesn't produce his wife at once, the "Enquirer" will have him arrested. Have him tell Mr. Silverstone he's a detective from the Central Office. If Mr.

Really, Mr. Kane, I can't see the function of a respectable newspaper -
But, Mr. Kane -
That'll be all today, Mr. Carter. You've been most understanding. Good day, Mr. Carter!
I've been a newspaperman my whole life and I don't intend - - if it's your intention that I should continue to be harassed by this - this - I warn you, Mr. Kane, it would go against my grain to desert you when you need me so badly - but I would feel obliged to ask that my resignation be accepted.
It is accepted, Mr. Carter, with assurances of my deepest regard.
It is accepted, Mr. Carter, with assurances of my deepest regard.
But Mr. Kane, I meant -
Mr. Kane, this is a surprise!
We've got a nice plant here.
Was the show covered by every department?
Exactly according to your instructions, Mr. Kane. We've got two spreads of pictures.

And the notice?

Yes - Mr. Kane.
Yes - Mr. Kane.
Is it good?

Yes, Mr. kane.
But there's another one still to come - the dramatic notice.
It isn't finished?
It isn't finished?
No, Mr. Kane.
No, Mr. Kane.
That's Leland, isn't it?
That's Leland, isn't it?
Yes, Mr. Kane.
Yes, Mr. Kane.
Has he said when he'll finish?
Has he said when he'll finish?
We haven't heard from him.
We haven't heard from him.
He used to work fast - didn't he, Mr. Bernstein?
The nurse has complete instructions, but if you care to talk to me at any time, I should be only too glad - I shall be here in the morning.
Thank you. I can't imagine how Mrs. Kane came to make such a silly mistake. The sedative Dr. Wagner gave her is in a somewhat larger bottle - I suppose the strain of preparing for her trip has excited and confused her.

There are no objections to my staying here with her, are there?

Not at all. I'd like the nurse to be here, too.
Not at all. I'd like the nurse to be here, too.
Of course.
How do you do? I came here - and I made Mr. Kane come with me... because I recieved this note -
I made Miss - Miss Alexander send you the note. She was a little unwilling at first - but she did it.
Maybe you can do it and maybe you can't, Mr. Kane.
Charles! Your - your breaking this man's neck - would scarcely explain this note - Serious consequences for Mr. Kane - for myself, and for my son. What does this note mean, Miss -
Let him finish, Charles.
I'm protecting myself every way I know how, Mrs. Kane. This last week, I finally found out how I can stop your husband from being elected. If the people of this state learn what I found out this week, he wouldn't have a chance to - he couldn't be elected Dog Catcher. Well, what I'm interested in is seeing that he's not elected. I

I think I understand, Mr. Rogers, but I wonder if -
What story, Mr. Rogers?
The story about him and Miss Alexander, Mrs. Kane.
You don't have to show me anything, Mr. Rogers. I believe you.
I'd rather Mr. Kane withdrew without having to get the story published. Not that I care about him. But I'd be better off that way - - and so would you, Mrs. Kane.
Hello, Brad -
Emily -
I'm sorry I sent for you, Brad - I didn't -
Chicago is pretty close to New York nowadays - only twenty hours -
Almost two to one -
I'm surprised he got the votes he did.
I'm surprised he got the votes he did.
Emily!
Emily!
Why should anyone vote for him? He's made it quite clear to the people what he thinks of them. Children - to be told one thing one day, something else the next, as the whim seizes him. And they're supposed to be grateful and love and adore him - because he sees to it that they get cheap ice and only pay a nickel

Emily, you're being - a little unfair - You know what I think of Charles' behavior - about your personal lives -
There aren't any personal lives for people like us. He made that very clear to me nine years ago - If I'd thought of my life with Charles as a personal life, I'd have left him then -

He's paying for it, Emily. Those returns tonight - he's finished. Politically - - socially, everywhere, I guess. I don't know about the papers, but -
If you're asking me to sympathize with him, Brad, you're wasting your time. There's only one person I'm sorry for, as a matter of fact. That - that shabby little girl. I'm really sorry for her, Brad.
What do you expect me to do? What in the world -
Charles.
They won't do anything to Junior, darling. Anonymous letter writers - I've got guards in front of the house, and I'm going to arrange -
Please don't talk any more, Charles.
Have they heard from father yet? Has he seen -
I've tried to tell you, Emily. The President's going to be all right. He had a comfortable night. There's no danger of any kind.
Here I am, darling... Darling!... Darling, it's all right... Mother's here.
Emily - you musn't leave me now - you can't do that to me.
Emily - you musn't leave me now - you can't do that to me.
They won't hurt you, darling. Mother's with you! Mother's looking after you!
I'm sending Junior home in the car, Charles - with Oliver -
But I'd arranged to go home with you myself.
But I'd arranged to go home with you myself.
There's a call I want you to make with me, Charles.
There's a call I want you to make with me, Charles.
It can wait.
It can wait.
No, it can't. Good night, darling.
What's this all about, Emily? I've had a very tiring day and -
It may not be about anything at all.
I intend to find out.
I insist on being told exactly what you have in mind.
I insist on being told exactly what you have in mind.
I'm going to - - 185 West 74th Street.
Oh!!
You're a cheap, crooked grafter - and your concern for your children and your mother -
You don't think I'm going to let this blackmailer intimidate me, do you?
I don't see what else you can do, Charles. If he's right - and the papers publish this story he has -
I don't see what else you can do, Charles. If he's right - and the papers publish this story he has -
Oh, they'll publish it all right. But that's not going to stop me -
Oh, they'll publish it all right. But that's not going to stop me -
Charles, this - this story - doesn't concern only you. I'll be in it, too, won't I? And Junior?
Charles, this - this story - doesn't concern only you. I'll be in it, too, won't I? And Junior?
I suppose so, but - I'm not afraid of the story. You can't tell me that the voters of this state -
I suppose so, but - I'm not afraid of the story. You can't tell me that the voters of this state -
I'm not interested in the voters of this state right now. I am interested in - well, Junior, for one thing.
Oh yes, there is.
I don't think so. Are you coming, Charles?
I don't think so. Are you coming, Charles?
No.
There's only one person in the world to decide what I'm going to do - and that's me. And if you think - if any of you think -
You decided what you were going to do, Charles - some time ago. You can't always have it your own way, regardless of anything else that may have happened. Come on, Charles.
You decided what you were going to do, Charles - some time ago. You can't always have it your own way, regardless of anything else that may have happened. Come on, Charles.
Go on! Get out! I can fight this thing all alone!
Charles, if you don't listen to reason, it may be too late -
Too late for what? Too late for you and this - this public thief to take the love of the people of this state away from me? Well, you won't do it, I tell you. You won't do it!
I can't tell you the things he said, Charlie. You haven't got any idea -
Rogers, I don't think I will postpone doing something about you until I'm elected. To start with, I'll break your neck.
You can't blackmail me, Rogers, you can't -
Charlie, he said, unless you withdrew your name -
Charlie, you're just excited. You don't realize -
I know exactly what I'm doing. Get out!
Get out, both of you!
Charlie, please don't -
Charlie, please don't -
What are you waiting here for? Why don't you go?
Ow!
What's the matter with you?
What's the matter with you?
Toothache.
Toothache.
Hmm!
You've got some on your face.
If these sidewalks were kept in condition - instead of the money going to some cheap grafter -
What's funny now?
You are. You look like you've been making mud pies.
Oh!
You're no Venus de Milo.
You're no Venus de Milo.
If you want to come in and wash your face - I can get you some hot water to get that dirt off your trousers -

Hey, you should be more careful. That's my ma and pa.
I'm sorry. They live here, too?
I'm sorry. They live here, too?
No. They've passed on.
Where's the soap?
In the water.
You're very easily amused.
I always like to see the funny side of things. No sense crying when you don't have to. And you're so funny. Looking at you, I forget all about my toothache.
Oh!
I can't stay here all night chasing your pain away.
I can't stay here all night chasing your pain away.
I know... But you do look so silly.
Where's the towel?
On the chiffonier. Here.

I've got a brush in the closet. As soon as the mud on your trousers is all dry - you just brush it off.

I'll get these streets fixed, if it's the last thing I do.
A chicken?
No. But you're close.
No. But you're close.
A rooster?

You're getting farther away all the time. It's a duck.

Excuse me, Mr. Kane. I know this takes a lot of nerve, but - who are you? I mean - I'm pretty ignorant, I guess you caught on to that -

No. That is, I bet it turns out I've heard your name a million times, only you know how it is -

You've been wonderful! I can't tell you how glad I am you're here, I don't know many people and -
You've been wonderful! I can't tell you how glad I am you're here, I don't know many people and -
And I know too many people. Obviously, we're both lonely. Would you like to know where I was going tonight - when you ran into me and ruined my Sunday clothes?
And I know too many people. Obviously, we're both lonely. Would you like to know where I was going tonight - when you ran into me and ruined my Sunday clothes?
I didn't run into you and I bet they're not your Sunday clothes. You've probably got a lot of clothes.
I didn't run into you and I bet they're not your Sunday clothes. You've probably got a lot of clothes.
I was only joking! This evening I was on my way to the Western Manhattan Warehouses - in search of my youth.
Who am I? Well, let's see. Charles Foster Kane was born in New Salem, Colorado in eighteen six - I run a couple of newspapers. How about you?
Oh, me -
Oh, me -
How old did you say you were?
How old did you say you were?
I didn't say.
I didn't say.
I didn't think you did. If you had, I wouldn't have asked you again, because I'd have remembered. How old?
I didn't think you did. If you had, I wouldn't have asked you again, because I'd have remembered. How old?
Pretty old. I'll be twenty-two in August.
Pretty old. I'll be twenty-two in August.
That's a ripe old age - What do you do?
That's a ripe old age - What do you do?
I work at Seligman's.
I work at Seligman's.
Is that what you want to do?
Is that what you want to do?
I want to be a singer. I mean, I didn't. Mother did for me.
I want to be a singer. I mean, I didn't. Mother did for me.
What happened to the singing? You're not in a show, are you?
What happened to the singing? You're not in a show, are you?
Oh, no! Nothing like that. Mother always thought - she used to talk about Grand Opera for me. Imagine! An American girl, for one thing - and then my voice isn't really that kind anyway, it's just that Mother - you know what mothers are like.
Yes -
As a matter of fact, I do sing a little.
As a matter of fact, I do sing a little.
Would you sing for me?
Would you sing for me?
Oh, you wouldn't want to hear me sing.
Oh, you wouldn't want to hear me sing.
Yes, I would. That's why I asked.
Yes, I would. That's why I asked.
Well, I -
Well, I -
Don't tell me your toothache is bothering you again?
Don't tell me your toothache is bothering you again?
Oh, no, that's all gone.
Oh, no, that's all gone.
Then you have no alibi at all. Please sing.
I couldn't make you see how I felt, Charlie. I just couldn't - I couldn't go threw with singing again. You don't know what it means to feel - to know that people - that an audience don't want you. That if you haven't got what they want - a real voice - they just don't care about you. Even when they're polite -
That's when you've got to fight them. That's when you've got to make them. That's -
Charlie! I said, what time is it?
Half past eleven.
Half past eleven.

At night?

Yes. The bulldog's just gone to press.
Yes. The bulldog's just gone to press.
Hurray for the bulldog! Half past eleven! The shows have just let out. People are going to night clubs and restaurants. Of course, we're different. We live in a palace - at the end of the world.

Invite everybody! Order everybody, you mean, and make them sleep in tents! Who wants to sleep in tents when they have a nice room of their own - with their own bath, where they know where everything is?
I mean it. Oh, I know I always say I mean it, and then I don't - or you get me so I don't do what I say I'm going to - but -
You're in a tent, darling. You're not at home. And I can hear you very well if you just talk in a normal tone of voice.

Susan, I really think -
Susan, I really think -
Oh, I don't mean the things you've given me - that don't mean anything to you. What's the difference between giving me a bracelet or giving somebody else a hundred thousand dollars for a statue you're going to keep crated up and never look at? It's only money. It doesn't mean anything. You're not really giving anything that belongs to you, that you care

Susan, I want you to stop this. And right now!
Well, I'm not going to stop it. I'm going to say exactly what I think. You've never given me anything. You've tried to buy me into giving you something. You're - - it's like you were bribing me!

Susan!
You're talking an incredible amount of nonsense, Susan. Whatever I do - I do - because I love you.
Love! You don't love anybody! Me or anybody else! You want to be loved - that's all you want! I'm Charles Foster Kane. Whatever you want - just name it and it's yours! Only love me! Don't expect me to love you -
You'll never have another chance to hit me again. I never knew till this minute -
Susan, it seems to me -

Don't tell me you're sorry.

I'm not sorry.

I'm going to leave you.
I'm going to leave you.
No, you're not.
No, you're not.
Yes.
Don't you realize that everybody here is going to know about this? That you've packed your bags and ordered the car and -
- And left? Of course they'll hear. I'm not saying goodbye - except to you - but I never imagined that people wouldn't know.
I won't let you go.
You can't stop me.
Goodbye, Charlie.
Don't go, Susan.
Don't go, Susan.
Let's not start all over again, Charlie. We've said everything that can be said.

She doesn't know, Mrs. Kane. She just sent it - because I made her see it wouldn't be smart for her not to send it.
In case you don't know, Emily, this - this gentleman - is -
In case you don't know, Emily, this - this gentleman - is -
I'm not a gentleman, Mrs. Kane, and your husband is just trying to be funny calling me one. I don't even know what a gentleman is. You see, my idea of a gentleman, Mrs. Kane - well, if I owned a newspaper and if I didn't like the way somebody else was doing things - some politican, say - I'd fight them with everything
Anything you say, Mr. Kane. Only we're talking now about what you are. That's what the note is about, Mrs. Kane. Now I'm going to lay all my cards on the table. I'm fighting for my life. Not just my political life. My life. If your husband is elected governor -
I'm going to be elected governor. And the first thing I'm going to do -
You do anything you want to do. The people of this state can decide which one of us to trust. If you want to know, they've already decided. The election Tuesday'll be only -
Mrs. Kane, I'm not asking you to believe me. I'd like to show you -
You're making a bigger fool of yourself than I thought you would, Mr. Kane. You're licked. Why don't you -
Get out! I've got nothing to talk to you about. If you want to see me, have the Warden write me a letter.
Get out! I've got nothing to talk to you about. If you want to see me, have the Warden write me a letter.
I see!
You're the greatest fool I've ever known, Kane. If it was anybody else, I'd say what's going to happen to you would be a lesson to you. Only you're going to need more than one lesson. And you're going to get more than one lesson.
Don't you worry about me. I'm Charles Foster Kane. I'm no cheap, crooked politician, trying to save himself from the consequences of his crimes -
It is the unanimous opinion of my Cabinent - in which I concur - that the proposed leases are in the best interests of the Governement and the people. You are not, I hope, suggesting that these interests are not indentical?
I'm not suggesting anything, Mr. President! I've come here to tell you that, unless some action is taken promptly - and you are the only one who can take it - the oil that is the property of the people of this country will be turned over for a song to a gang of high-pressure crooks!

Impossible! Impossible!

Is that really your idea of how to run a newspaper?
I don't know how to run a newspaper, Mr. Thatcher. I just try everything I can think of.

You see! There hasn't been a true word -
I think we'll have to send our friend Wheeler a cable, Mr. Bernstein. Of course, we'll have to make it shorter than his, because he's working on an expense account and we're not. Let me see - Mike!
I came to see you, Charles, about your - about the Enquirer's campaign against the Metropolitan Transfer Company.
Won't you step into my office, Mr. Thatcher?
Mr. Thatcher, isn't everything I've been saying in the Enquirer about the traction trust absolutely true?
They're all part of your general attack - your senseless attack - on everything and everybody who's got more than ten cents in his pocket. They're -

The trouble is, Mr. Thatcher, you don't realize you're talking to two people.
As Charles Foster Kane, who has eighty- two thousand, six hundred and thirty-one shares of Metropolitan Transfer - you see, I do have a rough idea of my holdings - I sympathize with you. Charles Foster Kane is a dangerous scoundrel, his paper should be run out of town and a committee should be formed to boycott him. You may, if you can form

Charles, my time is too valuable for me -
On the other hand - I am the publisher of the Enquirer. As such, it is my duty - I'll let you in on a little secret, it is also my pleasure - to see to it that decent, hard-working people of this city are not robbed blind by a group of money- mad pirates because, God help them, they have no one to
I happened to see your consolidated statement yesterday, Charles. Could I not suggest to you that it is unwise for you to continue this philanthropic enterprise - this Enquirer - that is costing you one million dollars a year?
You're right. We did lose a million dollars last year.
Get Dr. Corey.
Yes, sir.
Mrs. Kane would like to see you, Mr. Kane.
All right.
Is Mrs. Kane -
Marie has been packing since morning, Mr. Kane.
Close the door, Raymond.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Lock it - and keep it locked.
Raymond -
Yes, sir -
Do you like poetry, Raymond?
Can't say, sir.
Can't say, sir.
Mrs. Kane liked poetry -
Yes, Mr. Kane.
Not my wife - not either of them.
Oh, yes, sir.

He was dead... That's a poem. Do you know what it means?

No, I don't, Mr. Kane.
No, I don't, Mr. Kane.
I didn't used to be afraid of it.
Poor Mr. Carter!
What makes those fellows think that a newspaper is something rigid, something inflexible, that people are supposed to pay two cents for -
Tired?
It's been a tough day.
It's been a tough day.
A wasted day.
I've changed the front page a little, Mr. Bernstein. That's not enough - There's something I've got to get into this paper besides pictures and print - I've got to make the "New York Enquirer" as important to New York as the gas in that light.
What're you going to do, Charlie?
That's the second sentence you've started with "I" -
People are going to know who's responsible. And they're going to get the news - the true news - quickly and simply and entertainingly. And no special interests will be allowed to interfere with the truth of that news.
The "Chronicle" is a good newspaper.
It's a good idea for a newspaper. Four hundred sixy thousand.
Well, gentlemen, are we going to war?
Our readers are, anyway, I don't know about the rest of the country.

It'll be our first foreign war in fifty years, Brad. We'll cover it the way the "Hickville Gazette" covers the church social!

All right, Brad, all right - you don't have to be a war correspondent unless you want to - I'd want to. Hello, Georgie.
Charles, I tell you there is no war! There's a condition that should be remedied - but between that and a -
How would the "Enquirer" look with no news about this non-existent war - with Benton, Pulitzer and Heart devoting twenty columns a day to it?

They do it only because you do!
They do it only because you do!
And I do it because they do it, and they do it - it's a vicious circle, isn't it? I'm going over to Georgie's, Brad - you know, Georgie, don't you?
Say, Brad. I've got an idea.
Yes?
Yes?
I mean I've got a job for you.

You don't want to be a war correspondent - how about being a dramatic critic?
You don't want to be a war correspondent - how about being a dramatic critic?

You're wrong. It does make a difference to you - Rector's, Brad? Come to think of it, I don't blame you for not wanting to be a war correspondent. You won't miss anything. It isn't much of a war. Besides, they tell me there isn't a decent restaurant on the whole island.

Do you think you're the one who should call him a great man?

Why not?

Why not? Well - nobody's a great man in your estimation until he's dead.
What do you mean by that?
Yesterday morning you called the President a traitor. What do you think that crowd is doing down there? They think you murdered him.

Look out that window.
There are the people of the United States, and they are blaming you - Oh, I know it doesn't make any sense, but at least you can learn a lesson from it.
What lesson? Not to expose fraud when I see it? Not to fight for the right of the people to own their own property? Run it the way I said, Reilly - "This afternoon a great man was assassinated -"

Charlie! Now you're not making sense.
I don't have to. I run a newspaper with half a million readers and they're getting a martyred president this morning with their breakfast. I can't help that. Besides, they all know I'm married to his niece. I've got to think of her.

What?
I've got to think of Emily -
I've got to think of Emily -
I'd like to talk to you about that.
I'd like to talk to you about that.
Go ahead.
First of all -
What's wrong, Brad?
What's wrong, Brad?
I'm drunk.
I'm drunk.
I'll get you some coffee.
First of all, I will not write a good review of a play because somebody paid a thousand dollars for an advertisement in the "Enquirer."
That's just a little promotion scheme. Nobody expects you - Mike, will you try and get Mr. Leland some coffee?
Charlie, it's just no go. We can't agree anymore. I wish you'd let me go to Chicago.
Why, Brad?
Why, Brad?
I want to be transferred to the new paper. You've been saying yourself you wish you had somebody to - That's not what I wanted to talk about.
I'll tell you what I'll do, Brad - I'll get drunk, too - maybe that'll help.
No, that won't help. Besides, you never get drunk. I wanted to talk about you and Emily.
All right.
She's going to leave you -
She's going to leave you -
I don't think so, Brad. We've just had word that the President is out of danger. It seems I didn't kill him after all.
I don't think so, Brad. We've just had word that the President is out of danger. It seems I didn't kill him after all.
She was going to leave you anyway -
Emily's going south next week with the child. As far as anybody's to know, it's a holiday. When they get back -
Brad, you are drunk.
Brad, you are drunk.
Sure I am. She wants full custody of the child no matter what happens. If you won't agree to that, she'll apply for a divorce regardless of the President's wishes. I can't tell her she's wrong, because she isn't wrong -

Why is she leaving me?
She hasn't any friends left sine you started this oil business, and she never sees you.

Do you think the "Enquirer" shouldn't have campaigned against the oil leases?
Do you think the "Enquirer" shouldn't have campaigned against the oil leases?
You might have made the whole thing less personal!
There's no reason why this - this savage personal note -
The personal note is all there is to it. It's all there ever is to it. It's all there every is to anything! Stupidity in our government, complacency and self-satisfaction and unwillingness to believe that anything done by a certain class of people can be wrong - you can't fight those things impersonally. They're not impersonal crimes against people. They're being done by actual

They're not impersonal crimes against people. They're being done by actual
You almost convince me. I'm just drunk enough to tell you the truth. I have to be a little drunk for that because I'm a coward. You know that. That's why you keep me around. You only associate with your inferiors, Charlie. I guess that's why you ran away from Emily. Because you can't stand the company of your equals. You don't like to
You talk about the people of the United States as though they belonged to you. When you find out they don't think they are, you'll lose interest. You talk about giving them their rights as though you could make a present of liberty. Remember the working man? You used to defend him quite a good deal. Well, he's turning into something called organized labor
Are you finished?
Are you finished?
Yes. Now, will you let me go to Chicago?
Yes. Now, will you let me go to Chicago?
You're not going to like it in Chicago. They wind comes howling in from the lake. And there's practically no opera season at all - and the Lord only knows whether they've ever heard of Lobster Newburg -
You're not going to like it in Chicago. They wind comes howling in from the lake. And there's practically no opera season at all - and the Lord only knows whether they've ever heard of Lobster Newburg -
That's all right. What are you going to do about Emily?
That's all right. What are you going to do about Emily?
Nothing - if she dosen't love me -
You want love on your own terms, don't you, Charlie - Love according to your own rules. And if anything goes wrong and you're hurt - then the game stops, and you've got to be soothed and nursed, no matter what else is happening - and no matter who else is hurt!
It's simpler than that, Brad. A society girl can't stand the gaff, that's all. Other things are important to her - social position, what they're saying on the front porches at Southampton, is it going to be embarrassing to meet somebody or the other at dinner -
She can leave me. As a matter of fact, I've already left her. Don't worry, Brad - I'll live.
I know you will.
I know you will.
Hey, Brad! I've been analyzed an awful lot tonight - let's have another brandy.
You still want to be transferred to the other paper?
Yes.
Yes.
Well, you've been getting a pretty low salary here in New York. It seems to me that the new dramatic critic of our Chicago paper should get what he's worth.
Well, you've been getting a pretty low salary here in New York. It seems to me that the new dramatic critic of our Chicago paper should get what he's worth.
I couldn't possibly live on as little as that, Charlie. We'll let the salary stay where it is.
Hello, Brad.
Hello, Charlie - I didn't know we were speaking.
Maybe we'd better wait for more word on the President's condition.
What do you mean by that?
We'll withdraw support completely. Anything else?
Mr. Leland sent back that check.

You made it out to him last week after he left for Chicago.
You made it out to him last week after he left for Chicago.
Oh, yes, the bonus.

It was for twenty-five thousand dollars.
It does seem too good to be true, doesn't it, Mr. Bernstein?
Rogers isn't even pretending. He isn't just scared anymore. He's sick. Frank Norris told me last night he hasn't known Rogers to be that worried in twenty-five years.
Rogers isn't even pretending. He isn't just scared anymore. He's sick. Frank Norris told me last night he hasn't known Rogers to be that worried in twenty-five years.
I think it's beginning to dawn on Mr. Rogers that I mean what I say. With Mr. Rogers out of the way, Reilly, I think we may really begin to hope for a good government in this state. Well, Mr. Bernstein?
I'll sign those papers -
You people seem to forget that I'm the boy's father.
It's going to be done exactly the way I've told Mr. Thatcher -
If I want to, I can go to court. A father has a right to -
Well, let's hope it's all for the best.
It is. Go on, Mr. Thatcher -
Mr. Thatcher is going to take you on a trip with him tonight, Charles. You'll be leaving on Number Ten.
That's the train with all the lights.
You're going to live with Mr. Thatcher from now on, Charlie! You're going to be rich. Your Ma figures - that is, er - she and I have decided that this isn't the place for you to grow up in. You'll probably be the richest man in America someday and you ought to -
You won't be lonely, Charles...
Sorry, Mr. Thatcher! What the kid needs is a good thrashing!
That's what you think, is it, Jim?
That's what you think, is it, Jim?
Yes.
Mr. Leland, you were -
You don't happen to have a cigar, do you? I've got a young physician - must remember to ask to see his license - the odds are a hundred to one he hasn't got one - who thinks I'm going to stop smoking... I changed the subject, didn't I?

Sorry, Mr. Leland.
Sorry, Mr. Leland.
Never mind - Bernstein told you about the first days at the office, didn't he? Well, Charlie was a bad newspaper man even then. He entertained his readers, but he never told them the truth.

I can remember everything. That's my curse, young man. It's the greatest curse that's ever been inflicted on the human race. Memory - I was his oldest friend. As far as I was concerned, he behaved like swine. Maybe I wasnt' his friend. If I wasn't, he never had one. Maybe I was what nowadays you call a stooge -
What's this?

I am in receipt of your favor of yesterday. I beg you to do me the courtesy of accepting my assurance that Mrs. Whitehall cannot be induced to contribute any more information on the career of Charles Foster Kane. She has authorized me to state on previous occasions that she regards their brief marriage as a distateful episode in her life that she prefers
Brief marriage! Ten years!
Was he in love?
Was he in love?
He married for love - That's why he did everything. That's why he went into politics. It seems we weren't enough. He wanted all the voters to love him, too. All he really wanted out of life was love. That's Charlie's story - it's the story of how he lost it. You see, he just didn't have any to give. He loved Charlie Kane,
Well, that's about all there is - and I'm getting chills. Hey, nurse! Five years ago, he wrote from that place of his down South - - you know. Shangri-la? El Dorado? Sloppy Joe's? What's the name of that place? You know... All right. Xanadu. I knew what it was all the time. You caught on, didn't you?
Yes.
Yes.
I guess maybe I'm not as hard to see through as I think. Anyway, I never even answered his letter. Maybe I should have. I guess he was pretty lonely down there those last years. He hadn't finished it when she left him - he never finished it - he never finished anything. Of course, he built it for her -

I don't know. He was disappointed in the world. So he built one of his own - An absolute monarchy - It was something bigger than an opera house anyway - Nurse! Say, I'll tell you one thing you can do for me, young fellow.

Anything and everything - he was a regular crow.
I wonder - You put all this together - the palaces and the paintings and the toys and everything - what would it spell?
Or Rosebud? How about it, Jerry?
Turn that thing off, will you? It's driving me nuts! What's Rosebud?
Turn that thing off, will you? It's driving me nuts! What's Rosebud?
Kane's last words, aren't they, Jerry? That was Jerry's angle, wasn't it, Jerry? Did you ever find out what it means, Jerry?

Nothing is ever better than finding out what makes people tick. Go after the people that knew Kane well. That manager of his - the little guy, Bernstein, those two wives, all the people who knew him, had worked for him, who loved him, who hated his guts - I don't mean go through the City Directory, of course -
I'll get to it right away, Mr. Rawlston.
Good!
Yes, sir - yes, sir, I knew how to handle the old man. He was kind of queer, but I knew how to handle him.
Queer?
Queer?
Yeah. I guess he wasn't very happy those last years - he didn't have much reason to be -
That's the whole works, right up to date.
Sentimental fellow, aren't you?

Yes and no.
Yes and no.
Well, thanks a lot.
Well, thanks a lot.
See what I mean? He was a little gone in the head - the last couple of years, anyway - but I knew how to handle him. That "Rosebud" - that don't mean anything. I heard him say it. He just said "Rosebud" and then he dropped that glass ball and it broke on the floor. He didn't say anything about that, so I
You can go on asking questions if you want to.

You wouldn't want to hear a lot of what comes into my mind about myself and Mr. Charlie Kane.
How did you meet him?
I had a toothache.
I did a lot of singing after that. I sang for Charlie - I sang for teachers at a hundred bucks an hour - the teachers got that, I didn't -
What did you get?

What do you mean?
I didn't get a thing. Just the music lessons. That's all there was to it.
He married you, didn't he?

Right away. Will you have something, Mr. Thompson?
I'll have a highball.
She's just not talking to anybody from the newspapers, Mr. Thompson.
I'm not from a newspaper exactly, I -
She's plastered, isn't she?
She'll snap out of it. Why, until he died, she'd just as soon talk about Mr. Kane as about anybody. Sooner.

Call the police.
There's a strange man in our bathroom, and he just raped Caitlin!
Oh God...
I don't know. He just came in and asked to use the bathroom.
What time was this?

No. I place the time of death at about three-twenty.
Well he asked me for it!
I can't say for certain until we get him back to the lab, but my guess is he was masturbating, his heart seized and he died. That's when the girl found him. Something smells like shoe polish.

I saw one, one time, that said the world was ending the next week. Then in the next week's paper, they said we were miraculously saved at the zero hour by a Koala-fish mutant bird. Crazy shit.
So I'm no more responsible for my own decisions while I'm here at work than, say, the Death Squad soldiers in Bosnia?
Cute cat. What's his name.
Peptic ulcer.
You open?
Yeah.
What am I worried about? He'll probably be glad I started the ball rolling. All he ever did was complain about her anyway. I'm just looking out for his best interests. I mean, that's what a friend does, am I right? I did him a favor.

THE GLADES MOTEL?
