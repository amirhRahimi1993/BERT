Here she goes again...
Sailor, that ozone layer is disappearin'. Seems to me the government could do somethin' about it. One of these mornings the sun'll come up and burn a hole clean through the planet like an X-Ray.
You okay, honey?
That woman's laugh creeps me out. I heard somethin' like that... somewhere before... Sound'd like the wicked witch...

I'm always ready to dance. But I need me a kiss first, honey. Just one?
Hell, you just rubbed up against the wrong girl is all.
That's good... Now go get yourself a beer. You fellas have alotta the same power Elvis had... Y'all know this one?
What you want to watch this trash for? Ain't one of those people have a real thought in their brain.
That so? You want to tell me what, if any, real thoughts you had lately?
That so? You want to tell me what, if any, real thoughts you had lately?
What you have to get personal about so quick? All I mean is you could possibly read a book.
What's that honey?
We didn't have no TV up at Pee Dee, baby, you know?
I'm sorry, sweetie. I forget some moments where all you been the last two years.
Twenty-three months, eighteen days is all. Don't need to make more'n it was. This couple's goin' on a date to Hawaii. The girl chose him over the other two guys.

Yeah?
Yeah?
Wouldn't it be fabulous if we somehow stayed in love for the rest of our lives?

I just think about things as they come up. I never been much of a planner.
I just think about things as they come up. I never been much of a planner.
It ain't altogether terrible just to let things go along sometimes. Lula, I done a few things in my life I ain't too proud of, but I'll tell ya from now on I ain't gonna do nothin' for no good reason. All I know for sure is there's more'n a few bad ideas runnin' around loose out there.
Musta been a lesson tellin' ya it was the wrong time... What did you do, your mama find out?
She got me an abortion...
...I hope you appreciate my spendin' six hundred dollars, not countin' what it cost us to get here and back... This man's the best damn abortionist in the South.
You tell the boy who knocked you up?

It was my cousin, Dell, done it? His folks used to visit with us summers.

What happened to him?
What happened to him?
Oh, nothin'. I never let on to mama about Dell bein' the one. I just flat refused to tell her who the daddy was? I didn't tell Dell, neither. He was back home in Chattanooga by then, anyhow, and I didn't see the point. Somethin' terrible happened to him, though. Six months ago.

What's that, peanut?
What's that, peanut?
Dell disappeared. Dell was learnin' a hard lesson. What I learned from observin' Dell is I think people who are frightened want to disappear. He'd startin' behavin' weird? Like comin' up to people every fifteen minutes and askin' how they were doin'?
Actin' funny how?
Well, like mama told me, Aunt Rootie, Dell's mama? She found cockroaches in Dell's underwear.
One time, Aunt Rootie caught Dell puttin' one big cockroach on his anus?
Hell, peanut...
Hell, peanut...
One time - real late - like about two thirty a.m.? She found Dell up in the black of night all dressed and makin' sandwiches in the kitchen.
...are followin' him around.
Prob'ly the rain boys from Outer Space.
Prob'ly the rain boys from Outer Space.
It ain't so funny now, though. December before Christmas? Dell disappeared again and Aunt Rootie hired a private eye to find him. He was missin' for almost a month before he wandered back in the house on mornin' dressed in some filthy Santa Claus suit.
The private eye cost Aunt Rootie over a thousand dollars? Then a little while later Dell ran off a third time to some place he said would "give him peace of mind." Nobody's seen him since.
Sound like ol' Dell's more'n just a little confused, peanut... Too bad he couldn't visit that ol' Wizard of Oz and get some good advice.

There's worse things that can happen to a man, honey.
Yeah, I suppose. But you know somethin' baby, hair does make a difference.
Let's go dancin', peanut. I'm ready.
We gotta be careful, honey, my mama's gonna have Johnnie Farragut on us like a duck on a june bug, and he's one clever detective? You know how clever? He once told me that he could find an honest man in Washington. My toenails gotta dry first anyways, Sailor.

One thing puzzles my mind, sugar... You're twenty years old - aren't you ever curious why your mama has this fixation on keepin' us apart? Puttin' a detective on us. I'll tell ya Lula... Well... It's more'n me killin' Bob Ray Lemon...

Maybe my mama cares for me just a little too much...

You up for that?
You up for that?
I'd got to the far end of the world for you, baby... You know I would.
I'd got to the far end of the world for you, baby... You know I would.
Those toenails dry yet? We got some dancin' to do.
...That's an awful long way to go, just to get some pussy.
Yeah, I had my first taste on that trip to Juarez. At that age you still got a lot of energy.
Yeah, I had my first taste on that trip to Juarez. At that age you still got a lot of energy.
You still got plenty energy for me, baby.
Sorry, baby... When's the first time you done it with a girl who wasn't hookin'?
Maybe two, three months after Juarez. I was visitin' my cousin, Junior Train, in Savannah, and we were at some kid's house whose parents were out of town. A girl comes up to me that was real tall, taller than me.
She looked right at me and run her tongue over her lips and put her hand on my arm - told me her name was Irma.
What'd you say to her?
What'd you say to her?
Told her my name. Then she said somethin' like, 'It's so noisy down here. Why don't we go upstairs so we can hear ourselves?' She turned around and led the way. I knew I had an important lesson to learn that day.
When she got almost to the top step I stuck my hand between her legs from behind.
Oh, baby. What a bad boy you are!
Oh, baby. What a bad boy you are!
That's just what she said. I had a boner with a capital "O." I went to kiss her but she broke off laughin' and ran down the hallway. I found her lyin' on a bed in a room filled with assault weapons and Penthouse magazines. She was a wild chick. She was wearin' bright orange pants with kind of Spanish lookin' lacy black stripes

You mean like pedal pushers?
You mean like pedal pushers?
I guess.
She just rolled over onto her stomach and stuck her ass up in the air. I slid my hand between her legs and she closed her thighs on it.
You're excitin' me, honey. What'd she do?
You're excitin' me, honey. What'd she do?
Her face was half-pushed into the pillow, and she looked back over her shoulder at me and said, 'I won't suck you. Don't ask me to suck you.'

Poor baby. She don't know what she missed. What color hair she have?
Poor baby. She don't know what she missed. What color hair she have?
Sorta brown, blonde, I guess. But dig this, sweetie. Then she turns over, peels off them orange pants, and spreads her legs real wide and says to me...
I'll drop mama a postcard from somewhere. I mean, I don't want her to worry no more'n necessary.
What do you mean by necessary? She's prob'ly already called the cops, my parole officer, her p.i. boyfriend Johnnie Farragut.
What do you mean by necessary? She's prob'ly already called the cops, my parole officer, her p.i. boyfriend Johnnie Farragut.
I suppose so. She knew I was bound to see you soon as you was sprung, but I don't figure she counted on us takin' off together like this... I guess this means you're breakin' parole, then?
I suppose so. She knew I was bound to see you soon as you was sprung, but I don't figure she counted on us takin' off together like this... I guess this means you're breakin' parole, then?

You got about six more big states to go before we find out.
You got about six more big states to go before we find out.
We got through two states already.
That don't smell like a More.
It ain't. It's part of the lessons of life. I picked me up a pack of Vantages before we left the Cape?

Yeah, I guess, but - and here's the lesson part - they ain't supposed to be so bad for you.
Yeah, I guess, but - and here's the lesson part - they ain't supposed to be so bad for you.

Thank the Lord. Well, you ain't let me down yet, Sailor. That's more'n I can say for the rest of the world?
Life is a bitch and then you marry one.

We oughta stay somewhere outta the way. Not in no Holidays or Ramadas or Motel Six. If Johnnie Farragut's on our trail he'll check those first.
How about that one? The Host of the Old South Hotel.
Looks more like the Ghost of the Old South, but we'll try her.
I H-A-T-E hotel bedspreads. They don't hardly never get washed, and I don't like the idea of lyin' on other people's dirt.
Come look at this.

What's that, honey?

M-i-ss-i-ss-i-pp-i... You can almost hear that jazz blowin' up from the big N.O.
Lula... I learned somethin' interestin' today on a science show I heard on the radio... How leeches is comin' back into style.
Lula... I learned somethin' interestin' today on a science show I heard on the radio... How leeches is comin' back into style.
Say what? Honestly, sugar, you can talk more shit sometimes?
Got you a pack of Mores again, huh?
Yeah, it's a real problem for me, Sailor, you know? When I went in that drugstore by the restaurant in Biloxi? I saw 'em by the register and the girl throw 'em in. I'm not big on resistin'. So what about a leech?
Yeah, it's a real problem for me, Sailor, you know? When I went in that drugstore by the restaurant in Biloxi? I saw 'em by the register and the girl throw 'em in. I'm not big on resistin'. So what about a leech?
Heard on the radio how doctors is usin' leeches again, just in old times. You know, when even barbers used 'em?

I got one on me at Lake Lanier. Lifeguard poured salt on it and it dropped off. Felt awful. He was a cute boy, though, so it was almost worth it.
Yeah, well listen to this... Radio said back in the 1920s a I-talian doctor figured out that if, say, a fella got his nose cut off or bit off in, say, a barfight or somethin', they'd sew one of his forearms to his nose for a few weeks... Then put leeches on it.
Sailor? You expect me to believe a man'd be goin' around with a arm sewed to his nose?
Sailor? You expect me to believe a man'd be goin' around with a arm sewed to his nose?
How they used to do it. Course they got more sophisticated ways now. Radio said the Chinese, I think it is, figured a better idea is by insertin' a balloon in the forehead and lettin' it hang down on the nose.
Sailor Ripley! You stop! You're makin' this shit up and I ain't gonna sit for it!
Honest, Lula. I prob'ly ain't precisely got all the facts straight, but it's about what they said.
Honest, Lula. I prob'ly ain't precisely got all the facts straight, but it's about what they said.
Honey, we're goin' to bed now and it's time to change the subject.
We're about dry bones, sweetheart. We don't wanna have to push this "bird" into New Orleans.
We sure don't, honey... Get me a Mounds?
I love it when your eyes get wild, honey. They light up all blue almost and little white parachutes pop out of 'em. Oh, Sailor you're so aware of what goes on with me? I mean, you pay attention. And I swear, you got the sweetest cock. Sometimes it's like it's talkin' to me when you're inside? Like it's got a voice all it's
You really are dangerously cute, honey. I gotta admit it.
What lesson do get outta that story, Lula?
It's just another case, Sailor.
It's just another case, Sailor.
What's that, peanut?

Shhhhh... It's four o'clock... That woman's laugh the other day had somethin' to do with this feelin'?... Like bein' ripped apart by a gorilla, maybe... Grabbed sudden and pulled apart real quick by a real powerful one.
Lula, sometimes I gotta admit, you come up with some weird thoughts...
Anythin' interestin' in the world come out of somebody's weird thoughts, Sailor. You tell me Sailor, who could come up with shit like we're seein' these days?

Recall the time we was sittin' one night behind the Confederate soldier? Leanin' against it. And you took your hand and put it on your heart and you said, 'You feel it beatin' in there, Lula?... Get used to it, 'cause it belongs to you now.' D'you recall that?

I was hopin' you would. I know that night by heart. Sometimes, honey? I think it's the best night of my life.
I really do think it's the best night of my life.

You think so, baby? Does my talkin' bother you, honey?
No, I like gettin' up around four a.m. and talkin' bout wild animals... Though you woke me up this time in the middle of a dream. I kinda wish I didn't remember it. Up at Pee Dee, I couldn't remember any of my dreams.

What was this one?
What was this one?
It wasn't no fun, Lula. The wind was blowin' super-hard and I wasn't dressed warm. Only instead of freezin', I was sweatin' strong.
The water was rollin' off me. And I was dirty, too, like I hadn't had no bath in a long time, so the sweat was black almost.
Boy, sweetie, this is weird, okay.
Boy, sweetie, this is weird, okay.
I know. I kept walkin', I headed for your house, only it wasn't your house, really. You let me in only you weren't real pleased to see me. You kept askin', 'Why'd you come to see me now? Why now?' Like it'd been a long time since we'd seen each other.

Oh, baby, what an idea. I'd always be happy to see you, no matter what.
Oh, baby, what an idea. I'd always be happy to see you, no matter what.
I know, peanut. But it wasn't all like you were so unhappy I was there, just you were upset. My bein' there was upsettin' to you. You had some kids there, little kids, and I guess you'd got married and your husband was comin' home any minute.
Sometimes dreams just don't mean nothin'... Stuff comes into your mind and you don't have no control over, you know? Anyways, dreams ain't no odder than real life. Sometimes not by half.
Well, I ain't upset about it, darlin'. Just give me an odd feelin' there a minute, is all.
Let's get outta here... I suddenly got a funny feelin' about this place. Feelin' all that voodoo...
Gotta hex from a voodoo?
Gotta hex from a voodoo?
Who do?

Oh my God... It's Johnnie... Duck down!... Get goin'!
Where?
Where?
Never mind where... Get outta here... I mean it, Sailor.
Never mind where... Get outta here... I mean it, Sailor.

He was sittin' there havin' a beignet at the Cafe Du Monde. Do you think he saw us?
He was sittin' there havin' a beignet at the Cafe Du Monde. Do you think he saw us?
Lula, darlin'... Makes no difference anyway... We're outta here.
Sure you wanna do this? Might be a way they could track us.
He's just a regular guy't needs help, honey. Look at him.
You don't feel you was a little hard on the guy, honey?
I know you're thinkin' that I got more'n some of my mama in me? Well, I couldn't help it. Sailor, I really couldn't. I'm sorry for that guy, but when he pulled that drippin' hunk of awful-smellin' meat out of his pocket? I near barfed. And them poor diseased puppies!

Just part of life on the road, peanut.
Just part of life on the road, peanut.
Do me a favor, Sailor? Don't pick up no more hitchers, okay?
I wouldn't mind a little night life. How about you?
Hard to tell what's shakin' in a place like this, honey. You don't want to be walkin' in the wrong door.
Hard to tell what's shakin' in a place like this, honey. You don't want to be walkin' in the wrong door.
Maybe there's a place we could hear some music. I feel like dancin'. We could ask someone.
You ready for this?
We'll find out in a hurry.
I'll be damned if I'm leavin'. That band is too good?
Uh huh.
Uh huh.
You notice that woman when we come in? The white woman sittin' by herself?
You notice that woman when we come in? The white woman sittin' by herself?

Honey, I'm sorry. It wasn't nothin'. Come on and get up and we'll take off.
Leave me be for a minute? Mama gets all insane and then I see you practicin' your individuality and personal freedom with some oil-town tramp. How you figure I'm gonna feel?
Leave me be for a minute? Mama gets all insane and then I see you practicin' your individuality and personal freedom with some oil-town tramp. How you figure I'm gonna feel?

How much we got left, honey?
Under a hundred.
Under a hundred.
You want to stick around here, Sailor? See if we can get some work?

You want me to drive for a stretch? Give you a chance to rest.
That'd be good, Lula.
What's that, peanut?
I can't take no more of this radio... I ain't never heard so much concentrated weirdness in my life, Sailor Ripley, you find me some dancin' music right this minute... I MEAN IT!!
The world's gettin' worse, I think, Sailor. And it don't sound like there's much we can do about it, neither.
This ain't news, sweetheart. I hate to tell ya.
Sure is a big deal round here... Alamo Road, Alamo Street, Alamo Square, Alamo Buildin', Alamo Alamo. They ain't forgettin' about it in a hurry. That's the thing 'bout memory? Some things you wish you could forget... What's troublin' you, sugar?
You know, Lula, I never told you what all I was doin' before I met you.

Emily?
Your wife.
Your wife.
Oh. We're picking her up. Downtown.
Oh. We're picking her up. Downtown.
Perfect. Well then, shall we?
Do you know how many times I've boarded an airplane praying someone like her would sit down beside me? Particularly while I'm on my way to Pittsburgh.
Lay off Pittsburgh. It's one of the great cities.

It's fine. It's done. Basically. I'm just sort of... tinkering with it.
Great. I was hoping I could get a look at it sometime this weekend. Think that might be possible?

You didn't actually purchase this car, did you. Trip??
It was Jerry Nathan's. He owed me money.
It was Jerry Nathan's. He owed me money.
He owes God money. You know, he queered himself for good with Esquire.
He said something about being between things.
Yeah, between a bookie and a pair of broken legs.

I thought you were Mrs. Gaskell's hobby, Tripp.
Piss off, Crabs. I lost a wife today.
Piss off, Crabs. I lost a wife today.
Oh, I'm sure you'll find another. You always do.
Is that just beer?
Primarily. Although I gather you two staged a little raid on the Crabtree pharmacopoeia. You missed a few bottles, by the way.

He has a book.
I know. He started it Fall semester.

Well, I'm going to read it anyway.

I think it's more complicated than that. Besides, he's a little... scattered. He almost... did something stupid tonight. At least, I think so. Anyway, he doesn't need sexual confusion thrown into the stew right now.

On the contrary, it could be just the ticket.
No sexual confusion there, eh, Professor?
Shut up and drink.

Tripp.
Tripp.
Yes.
Yes.
Hit your brakes.
What's this guy's problem?
Just go around him.
Shit.
Back up. Go out the other way.
Wait here. I'll be right back.
Where would we go?
Tripp?!
Shit.
Listen, Hannah, I'm flattered, really, but right now I --
Tripp, where the hell...
You stay there.
What? Ohhhh. Is that... it?
Honestly, Tripp. Do you actually think I would sneak in here and read your book without asking you?
Gee, I don't know, Crabs. I don't seem to remember you actually asking me if you could invite 200 people over to trash my living room.

So tell me about you and the Chancellor.
What's to tell?

Plenty, I'm sure. But, for what it's worth...
Jesus. There must be two dozen windows on that thing. How are we supposed to find his?
I told you. They keep him chained in the basement. Come on.
Oh, Christ, don't start on ol' Gran or we'll leave you here.
Hey, I heard all about it -- the parents, the grandparents, the China town thing -- and I believe you, okay? That's why we're here. Now go get dressed.
So modest.
So sensitive.

Oh, come on, Tripp. Cut the kid some slack.

Is he awake?
I'm afraid he's pretty worn out, poor kid.

Nevertheless. There's a police officer standing on the porch and I don't think he's going away.
Shut up, James.
So what's the problem?

There is no problem. Did I say there was a problem?
Who do you think it is?
The Chancellor's here? Now?
The Chancellor's here? Now?
Evidently. Coming!
I want to publish this. I've got to. I think they'll let me. With a little editorial guidance it could be brilliant.
Great. Between you and Officer Pupcik out there he can be the next Jean Genet. It's been awhile since somebody wrote a good book in jail.
So -- what do we do now?
Find the jacket.
Find the jacket.
Oh! Huh. Exactly how do we do that?

Want some help with that?
Don't touch it.

Only now I'm starting to think the car wasn't exactly Jerry's to give.

Kind of a sign, you're saying.
In a sense.

I don't think so. In my experience, signs are usually a lot more subtle.
The jacket, Tripp. We need the jacket.
Oh, right. Oola. About that jacket...

No. But I don't think that matters.

That's very enlightened, Professor. It's comforting to know that America's children have you for a teacher.
Me? What can I do?
Gee, I don't know, Crabs... Improvise. You're good at that.
You peeked, didn't you?
I peeked.
How are you -- is it Joe?

I just want you to know that's why I dropped your class and said all that shit about the university stealing my money and you being a pseudo- Faulknerian nobody.
I'll be... somewhere else.

You need to see a doctor, Mr. Tripp. An internist. And I think you really ought to consider seeing a therapist, as well.

Her dog, yes.

Actually, it was her husband's dog...
Look, Mr. Tripp. You have a drug problem, all right? On top of that, you have a bite on your ankle that is severely infected. We pumped you with antibiotics so you'll be fine, but another day or two and you might have lost the foot. As for your spells. I'm guessing they're a result of the anxiety you've been experiencing lately.
They're anxiety attacks? That's a little disappointing.

Not true. You're the only Vernon I know. Actually, I'm wrong. I once knew a Vernon Peabody at Penguin U.K.
Shut up. Cupcake. Please. Inside.
It's just a souvenir. They don't even make the caps anymore.
Bullshit. I know a gun when I see one. And that's a gun.

And you're saying it's some kind of sign? What the fuck's the matter with you?
Hey, Vernon. Can I ask you a question?
Shoot.

As long as it looks like her, I don't care. You know what I'm saying?
Right. Well, thanks. For the lift.
No sweat. Only do me a favor?

Are you there to not reconcile with her?
Goodbye, Grady.

Trust me, I understand. I just want to say something to you, Grady.
Trust me, I understand. I just want to say something to you, Grady.
Yea?
Yea?
How you choose to live your own life is your business. But you be careful with that boy, Grady. With James. He belongs to somebody else.
It was my mother's. She won it in a penny arcade in Baltimore when she was in Catholic school.
It's very convincing.
It's very convincing.
It used to shoot these little paper caps, but they don't make them anymore. The caps.
It's just... for good luck. Some people carry rabbits' feet...

Are you and Hannah seeing each other, James?
No! What gave you that idea?

Relax, James. I'm not her father. I just rent her a room.

She likes old movies like I do, that's all. Besides, she doesn't really know me. She thinks she does, but she doesn't. Maybe it's because she's Mormon and I'm Catholic.
Maybe it's because she's beautiful and she knows it and try as she might to not let that screw her up, it's inevitable that it will in some way.
You're not like my other teachers, Professor Tripp.
You're not like my other students, James. So what was the movie you two saw?

They really hated it. I think they hated it more than any of the other ones.

You cold, James?
A little.
A little.
So what are you doing out here?
So what are you doing out here?
It's colder in there.
It's colder in there.
You're right.
Actually, I saw the greenhouse. So I thought... I thought I'd come out here and take a look at it. You don't see one of those every day. It looks like heaven...
Heaven?
Heaven?
I saw a movie once. Part of it took place in heaven. Everyone wore white and lived in crystal houses. Like that. At least that's the way I remember it...
James. Don't leave just yet. There's something I think you ought to see.
I'll miss my bus.
I'll miss my bus.
This is worth it.
Is that really it?
That's really it.
That's really it.
The one she wore on her wedding day?

So I'm told.
Go ahead.
Really?
Really?
Really.
They're glass. The buttons.
Like the lady herself.
It's feels unreal, like butterfly wings or... something. It must've cost Dr. Gaskell a lot.
I guess. Walter never tells Sara the truth about how much he pays for these things.
I guess. Walter never tells Sara the truth about how much he pays for these things.
You're really good friends with the Chancellor, aren't you?
Pretty good. I'm friends with Dr. Gaskell, too.
I guess you must be, if you know the combination to his closet and he doesn't mind your being here in their bedroom like this.
I guess you must be, if you know the combination to his closet and he doesn't mind your being here in their bedroom like this.
Right.
I'm sorry. Professor Tripp. Maybe it's seeing that jacket that belonged to her. It just looks... really lonely. Hanging there. In a closet. Maybe I'm just a little sad.
Maybe. I'm feeling a little sad myself tonight.
Maybe. I'm feeling a little sad myself tonight.
You mean, with your wife leaving you and all? Hannah mentioned something about it. About a note.
You mean, with your wife leaving you and all? Hannah mentioned something about it. About a note.
Yes. Well. It's complicated, James. I think we should go now.
Shit, James. You shot Dr. Gaskell's dog.
I had to. Didn't I?
I had to. Didn't I?
Couldn't you've just pulled him off me?
Couldn't you've just pulled him off me?
No! He was crazy. I didn't -- he looked -- I thought --
No! He was crazy. I didn't -- he looked -- I thought --
Okay, okay. Take it easy. Don't freak out on me.
Do you have a mirror? It's the best way to see if someone's breathing.
He's dead, James. Believe me, I know a dead dog when I see one.
Professor Tripp? Can I ask you a question?
Yea, James.
Yea, James.
What are we going to do with...
I don't know. I'm still trying to figure out how to tell the Chancellor I murdered her husband's dog.
You?
You?
Trust me, James, when the family pet's been assassinated, the owner doesn't want to hear one of her students was the triggerman.

Can I ask you something about her?
Can I ask you something about her?
She is. Ah. Here we go...
Oh. So. Is -- is your friend Crabtree -- is he -- gay?
Most of the time he is, James. Some of the time he isn't. Now what do we have here?
Looks like... our old friend Mr. Codeine. That should take the pinch out of my ankle. Have one.
No thanks. I'm fine without them.
No thanks. I'm fine without them.
Right. That's why you were standing in the Chancellor's back yard twirling that little cap gun of yours tonight. You're fine, all right, you're fit as a fucking fiddle.
This is so embarrassing! You guys had to carry me out.
Is he all right?
Mmhmmm... knap... sap...
What's he saying?
Shit. He must've left it back at Thaw. In the auditorium.
Mmrrmmm... KNAP SAP!
Thank you.
You're welcome.
I'm okay. I just lost my balance.
I put you on the floor.
I put you on the floor.
Oh.
Oh.
I thought you might -- I don't know -- swallow your tongue or something. I guess you really miss her, huh?
Huh? Oh, no. This isn't Emily's. I just write in it.
I guess there's probably a story behind that.

There is, but it's not that interesting.
Want me to get that?
Sure.
He didn't give his name.
Who?
Who?

Well, James, you did shoot the Head of the English Department's dog and steal his most prized piece of memorabilia.
How's that?
Well done, James.

A couple weeks. That's why... that's why I had the gun. For protection.

Jesus, James, you should've told someone.
Jesus, James, you should've told someone.
Who?
Who?
I don't know... Me.
Isn't this...?
Hm.
I can't help myself. I don't know what's the matter with me.
Shit, James, you're hungover. What do you think's the matter with you?
She seemed to take it pretty well.
Yeah, well, actually...
Don't be proud, James. We're in Sewickley Heights. We could find you a nice golf course to barf on.
No.
I've got a thing about, places like this. I know what those houses are like. I know what the people are like.
Your aunt?
Humboldt County?
Maybe...
Maybe...
It's my father. He gets it from his doctor.
It's my father. He gets it from his doctor.
Glaucoma?
Glaucoma?
Colon cancer.
Colon cancer.
Jesus, James. Wow.
It's a bit of a scandal. My parents live in a small town.
Where's that?
Where's that?
Carvel.
Carvel.
Carvel? Where's Carvel?
Carvel? Where's Carvel?
Outside Scranton.
Outside Scranton.
I never heard of it.
I never heard of it.
It's a hellhole. Three motels and a mannequin factory. My dad worked there for thirty-five years.

Seitz Plastics. That's where he met my mom. She was a fry cook in the cafeteria. Before that, she'd been a dancer.

James Leer, are you telling me your mother was a stripper?
James Leer, are you telling me your mother was a stripper?
I'm telling you what I was told by my uncle. And he should know. He ran half a dozen men's clubs in Baltimore before he skipped town on a bad debt.

Didn't you say your Mom went to Catholic school?

When we fall, we fall hard.
When we fall, we fall hard.
Amazing.
I thought you were the guy who didn't like to lose control of his emotions.
Maybe I just needed the moment to present itself.
This is so nice. It's like where Andy Hardy would live. What's it called again?
Kinship.
Kinship.
Kinship. And what's here?
Kinship. And what's here?
Unless I miss my bet... my wife.
The one that left you?
That's right. That one.
Someone jumped on your car with their butt...
How can you tell?
How can you tell?
You can see the outline of a butt.
Want one. They're incredible. Incredible.
Smoke the rest of that joint, James, and you can start on the box.
Maybe she didn't come here.
She came here. We'll just wait. In the meantime, I need you to shimmy through.
Relax. Emily hasn't carried a house key since she was twelve years old. And your hips are as slim as hers.
It's not that. It just reminded me of -- you know -- of what's in the car. In the trunk.
It's not that. It just reminded me of -- you know -- of what's in the car. In the trunk.
Oh. Right. Well, let's try not to think about that.
It feels really... good... here.
I know. It's the house you want to wake up in on Christmas morning. Make yourself at home. I'll be right back.
I just wanted a little sip.
I just wanted a little sip? Tell me, James, exactly what point was it that you turned into Serpent Boy?
I just wanted a little sip? Tell me, James, exactly what point was it that you turned into Serpent Boy?
Probably about the time you gave me the codeine pills last night.
Jesus... Look, James, you appear to possess -- like many an aspiring writer before you, by the way -- a rather ardent affinity for the stuff of which dreams are made. However, I think it's best if, for the moment at least ...we abstain.
You're mad at me, aren't you?
You're mad at me, aren't you?
What?
What?
You're mad because I shot your girlfriend's dog.
You're mad because I shot your girlfriend's dog.
It wasn't her dog. It's her husband's -- Who said anything about girlfriend?
Okay, James, I wish you hadn't shot my girlfriend's dog. Even though Poe and I weren't exactly what you'd call simpatico, that's no reason for him to take two in the chest. Still, the fact remains that I'm the one who took you up into the Chancellor's bedroom. I'm the one who has to take the blame. I don't know what the hell I
Sure you do. You were thinking: 'That's no cap gun in that kid's overcoat.' You were thinking 'I can't let that kid get on the bus alone -- he might never get on the bus again.' You were thinking: 'I've got to find a way to distract this kid.' So you did. It was -- in its way -- a noble act.

Thanks for the halo, James, but I've never done that much thinking ahead in my life -- ever.
So, why did you take me up there?
I don't know, James. I don't know why I do half the things I do. Who does? Why do you wear that coat?
It's warm.
James, fall semester, first day of class, it was 95 degrees and you were wearing the coat.
That's why they all give you such a hard time in workshop.
Because of my coat?
Because of my coat?
Because you act like a goddamn spook all the time. Not to mention the fact that every last one of them is jealous of you.
Because you act like a goddamn spook all the time. Not to mention the fact that every last one of them is jealous of you.
Jealous? Of me?
Jealous? Of me?
Not you. Your talent.
You're lying.
The hell I am.
The hell I am.
Yes you are. My stuff stinks. I know it. You said so yourself.
Yes you are. My stuff stinks. I know it. You said so yourself.
I never said that.
I never said that.
Yes you did. Last night. To your friend Crabtree. "Is he any good?" he said. And you said: "Not yet he isn't." I heard you myself.

It's okay, Professor Tripp. Carrie, Howard, the others -- they're right. My stories are annoying. They go on and on and on, and the longer they go on the more annoying they become, until finally you just want to grab something heavy and --
Shut up, James. You're annoying. Carrie and Howard don't know what the fuck they're talking about, okay? The entire class combined -- including the lovely Hannah Green -- has about one tenth of one percent the talent you have, okay?
But, last night...
Who cares what I said last night, James I -- I was drunk, I was stoned. I'd been bitten by a dog. My wife had left me. How 'bout cutting me some slack?
Who cares what I said last night, James I -- I was drunk, I was stoned. I'd been bitten by a dog. My wife had left me. How 'bout cutting me some slack?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
And don't be so goddamn sensitive. Who cares what anybody thinks anyway? You want to be a good writer? You want to be a great writer? Then stop giving a damn what other people think. Most of them haven't thought in years.
Let me spell it out for you, James. Books don't mean anything. Not to anybody. Not anymore.
Arsonist's Daughter meant something.
You coming?
In a minute. Get us a table.
Want a bite?
No thanks.
No thanks.
That's why you're having them. Your spells.
That's why you're having them. Your spells.
Spells? Jesus, James, you make it sound like we're in a Tennessee Williams play. I don't have spells.
Spells? Jesus, James, you make it sound like we're in a Tennessee Williams play. I don't have spells.
What would you call them then?
What would you call them then?
I don't know... 'Episodes.'
It's because you don't eat.
I eat.
I eat.
When?
When?
When nobody's looking.
You just worry about yourself, James. Okay?
Okay.
Where you going?
Nowhere. You just sit here and... eat.
I'm not going with them.
James. Listen. Things -- things are a little weird with me right now and I -- well --I have enough blame to shoulder these days without having to take the blame if something bad happened to you. And if you hang around me long enough, something bad is going to happen, trust me. That's why I need you to go home. Understand?
James. Listen. Things -- things are a little weird with me right now and I -- well --I have enough blame to shoulder these days without having to take the blame if something bad happened to you. And if you hang around me long enough, something bad is going to happen, trust me. That's why I need you to go home. Understand?
I'm not going, with them.
I'm not going, with them.
James, like it or not, they're your parents.
James, like it or not, they're your parents.
Parents? They're not my parents. They're my grandparents. My parents are dead.
I remember that. Five or six years ago.
Six. Their plane went down right outside Scranton.
Six. Their plane went down right outside Scranton.
Near Carvel?
Near Carvel?
I'm sorry about all that. I just -- I don't like to talk about my family. They treat me like a freak. She makes me sleep in the basement of my own house. It's mine. My parents left it to me.
Get out of here.
That's why she hates me. That's why she makes me sleep in the basement.
That's why she hates me. That's why she makes me sleep in the basement.
In the crawl space, with the rats and the casks of Amontillado. Come on. Up.
Can I -- I mean -- do you mind -- if I wear this again. Professor Tripp?
Ah, wear whatever you want.
And we both thank you for that, but we're... we're... fine.
I'm fine, right. Fit as a fucking fiddle.
Does she mean -- does she know about... her dog?
It's Walter's dog and yes, she does know. But let's spare her the details. Come on, your shoes are in the hail.
Don't worry, James, I'll figure something out.
I'm not worried. You're not worried, are you. Professor Tripp?
I'm not worried. You're not worried, are you. Professor Tripp?
I'm a little worried, James.
I'm a little worried, James.
Don't be. I don't care if they expel me. I probably should be expelled.
Don't be. I don't care if they expel me. I probably should be expelled.
Well, let's see if we can keep that from happening.
Professor Tripp...?
Yes, James.
Yes, James.
Even if I end up going to jail....
Yes, Hannah?
I think maybe we're missing the point. It seems to me James' strength as a writer is that he doesn't take us by the hand. He treats us like adults. He respects us enough to forget us. That takes... courage.
Thanks for that. He all right?
I think so... What about you?
I think so... What about you?
Me? Sure. Why?
Me? Sure. Why?
Just checking.
He's going with me. You take Crabtree. And his friend. All right?
Ail right. By the way, his friend...?
Ail right. By the way, his friend...?
The answer's yes. I think. Yes. I don't know. Where are they exactly?
James. This is my editor, Terry Crabtree.
James'll know about George Sanders.
I've been re-reading Arsonist's Daughter. It's so beautiful, Grady. So natural. It's like all your sentences always existed, just waiting around in Style Heaven, or wherever, for you to fetch them down.
I thank you.
I thank you.
And I love the inscription you wrote to me. Only I'm not quite the downy innocent you think I am.
And I love the inscription you wrote to me. Only I'm not quite the downy innocent you think I am.
I hope that isn't true. We need all the downy innocents we can get.
So what are you going to do?
Do?
Do?
I just mean, I -- I guess Emily isn't going to be there when you get home.
Look, Hannah. When you get him home... make sure he's all right. Before you leave. Okay?
I would if I knew where I was taking him.
I would if I knew where I was taking him.
Hannah, are you telling me you don't know where James Leer lives?
Hannah, are you telling me you don't know where James Leer lives?
Some apartment somewhere. But I've never seen it.
Some apartment somewhere. But I've never seen it.
That strikes me as odd.
That strikes me as odd.
James is odd. I know he has an aunt in Sewickley Heights. I dropped him there once, but... Come to think of it, it wasn't even his Aunt's house. He said she worked there. Or something. I don't remember.
His bag. You know that ratty green thing he's always carrying around. He must've left it inside.
Hh-uh. Last time I saw it was...
All right. Take him to my place. He can crash on the sofa.
The one in your office? It's the best one for naps.
The one in your office? It's the best one for naps.
I don't think it really matters, Hannah. We could probably stand him up in the garage with the snow shovels at this point.
I thought we were going to talk. Last night.
Oh. Well. I...
Hey.
Grady!
I know I shouldn't have, but there it was, just sort of lying out, and I couldn't resist and -- and -- I suck.
No, it's okay. I just can't believe I left it out in the open like that. Crabtree hasn't been in here, has he? Poking around?
No, it's okay. I just can't believe I left it out in the open like that. Crabtree hasn't been in here, has he? Poking around?
I don't know -- maybe -- I don't think so.
Listen, Hannah. You don't remember where that aunt worked, do you? James' aunt.
He shot the Chancellor's dog, didn't he? The blind one.
He shot the Chancellor's dog, didn't he? The blind one.
Actually, He's not the Chancellor's -- What?
Actually, He's not the Chancellor's -- What?
At first the police thought he just ran away, but this afternoon Dr. Gaskell found some blood spots on the carpet --

Crabtree said it sounded like something James would be messed up in.
Crabtree said it sounded like something James would be messed up in.
Crabtree? He doesn't even know James.
Crabtree? He doesn't even know James.
Who does?
The aunt, Hannah. Where did you take James that day?
I told you, Sewickly Heights.
I told you, Sewickly Heights.
But where? I need the street.
But where? I need the street.
I don't know, Grady. I just dropped him on a corner.
He cribbed that from Borges.
It beats 'What's your major?'
Right. Anyway, I was wondering if I could borrow your car. Mine's sort of out of commission.
Sure. The keys are on the dresser next to... to your book.
I uh, I didn't finish, I... fell asleep.
That good, huh?
That good, huh?
No, it's not that, it's...
It's just that, you know, I was thinking about how, in class, you're always telling us 'that writers make choices -- at least the good ones. And, don't get me wrong. I'm not saying the book isn't really great -- I mean, really great -- but at times it's, well, very detailed, you know, with the genealogies of everyone's horses and all the dental
Uh huh. Well, thanks for the thought, but, as shocking as this may sound, I'm not the first writer to sip a little weed. And furthermore, it might interest you to know that one book I wrote, as you say, 'under the influence,' happened to win a little something called the PEN award which, by the way, I accepted 'under the influence.'
Professor Tripp.
Chancellor.
Chancellor.
I got the message you called.
I got the message you called.
I got the message you called too.
Easy there.
I'm sorry. It's these goddamned shoes. I don't know how anyone actually walks in these things.
I need to talk to you.
That's funny. I need to talk to you, too. Perhaps you could put some of these coats in the upstairs guest room, Professor Tripp.

I don't believe I know where the upstairs guest room is.
I don't believe I know where the upstairs guest room is.
Well then. I'd better show you. Terry --
New?
Walter just got it back from the framer today.
You go first.
All right. This morning --
All right. This morning --
I'm pregnant.
I'm sure.
Well. This is... surprising. Does Walter...?
Well. This is... surprising. Does Walter...?
I think Walter would find this a little more than surprising.
Emily left me this morning.
She's left before...
She's left before...
She's left the room before. She always came back.
So. I guess we just divorce our spouses, marry each other, and have this baby, right? Simple.
Simple.
Is that Cristaile?
Hm.
Hm.
My God, I wear the same scent as a transvestite. She IS a transvestite, isn't: she?
My God, I wear the same scent as a transvestite. She IS a transvestite, isn't: she?
If she's not now, Terry will make sure she is by the end of the evening.
If she's not now, Terry will make sure she is by the end of the evening.
Has he asked to see the book yet?
Has he asked to see the book yet?
Yes.
Yes.
And? Are you going to tell him?
And? Are you going to tell him?
No. Maybe. I don't know. I don't know what I'm going to do.
No. Maybe. I don't know. I don't know what I'm going to do.
Neither do I.
Sara, my arm. I'm stuck, honey.
I guess you're going to have to chew it off then.
You had another one, didn't you? You have to see a doctor, Grady. First thing Monday morning. All right?
Is the thing -- is it over?
Is the thing -- is it over?
Almost. Want to sit up? What's the matter?
Almost. Want to sit up? What's the matter?
Nothing. I think I twisted my --
Well...
Don't. I know what you're going to say.
Don't. I know what you're going to say.
No, really, Sara, I don't think you --
No, really, Sara, I don't think you --
You love Emily. I know that. And you need to stay with her.
You love Emily. I know that. And you need to stay with her.
I don't think I really have a choice in, that. Emily left me.
I don't think I really have a choice in, that. Emily left me.
She'll come back. That's why I'm going to... to not have this baby.
Not have it.
No. There's no way. I mean, don't you think there's no way?
No. There's no way. I mean, don't you think there's no way?
Well, no, I don't see any way. And I know how hard it is for you to -- to lose this chance.
Well, no, I don't see any way. And I know how hard it is for you to -- to lose this chance.
No you don't. And fuck you for saying you do. And fuck you for "saying... ...for saying there's just no way. Because there could be a way, Grady.
Who's gun is that?
It's -- it's a souvenir. Of Baltimore.
Heavy. Smells like gunpowder.
Caps.
Pow.
You got me.
You got me.
I love you, Grady.
I can't believe you hung up on me, you dick.
Totally. I'm sorry. A lot was happening this morning. Can you talk?
Walter's on campus, being the good soldier for WordFest. But he's a basket case. Someone stole Marilyn's jacket last night. And Poe's missing, too.
I heard.
I heard.
You heard? How?
You heard? How?
A twelve-year-old policeman came by the house this morning.
A twelve-year-old policeman came by the house this morning.
Did you confess?
Your fingerprints were all over the bedroom.
Really? That was fast.
Really? That was fast.
I'm kidding. Hello?
I'm kidding. Hello?
Oh. Right. Ha. Listen, about last night. There is something I need to tell...
Oh. Right. Ha. Listen, about last night. There is something I need to tell...
Are you limping? Why are you limping?
Are you limping? Why are you limping?
Hub? Oh, well, that's part of what I need to...
Hub? Oh, well, that's part of what I need to...
Did you pass out again, Grady? Did you fall somewhere?
Did you pass out again, Grady? Did you fall somewhere?
No. I mean. Well, actually, yes. Sort of. I don't remember. Listen, Sara, I have to tell you something.
No. I mean. Well, actually, yes. Sort of. I don't remember. Listen, Sara, I have to tell you something.
All right.
Gee, Grady, that sounded so heartfelt. I don't know whether to swoon or smirk.
Really, Sara, I...
I believe you. I believe you want to be with me. But this is not just about me anymore.
I know that. I know what's at stake here...
I know that. I know what's at stake here...
No, I don't think you do. And besides... I haven't decided yet.
No, I don't think you do. And besides... I haven't decided yet.
About the baby.
About the baby.
That... and you.
Who's that sitting in your car?
James Leer.
James Leer.
What's he doing out there?
What's he doing out there?
I'm sort of helping him work through some issues.
Sara.
I tried to call, but apparently there's something wrong...
Oh?
It seems one of our students is -- missing and his parents found a dead dog in his bed.
It seems one of our students is -- missing and his parents found a dead dog in his bed.
I'm sorry, Sara. I've been trying to tell you. It's all my --
I'm not very happy with you right now, Grady. But more importantly, Walter's not very happy and he's gotten the police involved. They seem to think James Leer is somehow responsible for all of this. You wouldn't happen to know where James is, would you, Grady?
Inside.
Inside.
And the jacket?
And the jacket?
Over there. In the backseat of the...
Someone stole my car.
Grady.
Grady.
Honestly. Someone stole my car. I parked it right there last night.
Honestly. Someone stole my car. I parked it right there last night.
Are you sure you parked it there?
Are you sure you parked it there?
Of course, I'm sure. Ah, Christ, the puberty police are back.
This is not what the university has in mind when it promises a liberal education, Grady.
Would Walter really press charges?
Would Walter really press charges?
It's within the realm. He takes his souvenirs pretty seriously. And he was just a wee bit prickly this morning.
You didn't happen to call the house last night, did you, Grady?
I think I might have.
I think I might have.
And what do you think you might have said?
And what do you think you might have said?
I think I might've said I was in love with you.
He told you.
He told me.
He told me.
And what did you say?
And what did you say?
I said it didn't sound like you.
I'm so glad to see you, Sara.
I believe you. Did that nice doctor let you out? Or is this you improvising again, Grady?
I believe you. Did that nice doctor let you out? Or is this you improvising again, Grady?
I'm through improvising.
I'm through improvising.
Terry told me about Wonder Boys. Is it true? Did you lose it all?
Terry told me about Wonder Boys. Is it true? Did you lose it all?
I lost it all.
I lost it all.
Oh, Grady. You're such a putz.
Oh, Grady. You're such a putz.
I know.
I know.
And you're old.
Ouch. How many?
Dozens. It's very sad.
I went and looked at some babies just now.
Oh?
Oh?
I guess you have to go on faith.
I guess you have to go on faith.
Some times...
Did you tell Walter?
I told Walter.
I told Walter.
Does he still love you?
Does he still love you?
It didn't come up.
Did you just make that up?
In the hospital. I was kind of excited about it at the time, but then I was on pretty heavy painkillers.
You don't deserve me, you know.
I know, but sometimes...
The more the merrier.
Terry was telling me about you on the plane. It was all so interesting.
That perfume you're wearing, Antonia. It wouldn't happen to be Cristaile, would it?
Why yes. How did you know?
Why yes. How did you know?
Lucky guess.
That's a nice greenhouse.
It's Mrs. Gaskell's. Her hobby.
Who's he barking at now?
He's still barking at me. He's blind.
I need a ride.
I'm your man.
Couldn't he have just thrown a shoe at the poor thing?
James is... I don't know...
James is... I don't know...
Disturbed. And when your friend Crabtree gets done with him, he's going to be even more disturbed.
Disturbed. And when your friend Crabtree gets done with him, he's going to be even more disturbed.
I'm not sure that's possible.
I'm not sure that's possible.
Sure it is.
Listen, Antonia --
Tony. Now that I'm home.
Tony. Now that I'm home.
Tony. I'm sorry if things didn't work out so well for you tonight. With Terry.
Tony. I'm sorry if things didn't work out so well for you tonight. With Terry.
Forget it. I should've known better. Your friend is just, I don't know, into collecting weird tricks. Mind?
He's writing his name in water.
What's that?
What's that?
Like most editors, he really wants to be a writer, but he's too busy living a novel to bother writing one.
Like most editors, he really wants to be a writer, but he's too busy living a novel to bother writing one.
That sounds like a fancy excuse for being a shit.
That sounds like a fancy excuse for being a shit.
He'd call it habit. But now... I get the feeling he's going through the motions a bit.
You mean because his career's ruined and all?
Jesus. Is that what he told you?
Jesus. Is that what he told you?
He said he hasn't had a success in ten years and everyone in New York thinks he's kind of a...
That's nice. All we have is a Japanese beetle trap.
It's a bathtub. What she's standing under.
Walter?
Yes?
Who's this ?
It's Grady, Walter.
It's Grady, Walter.
Grady?

GRADY Tripp. English Department.

I know it's you, Grady, I just... Christ, Grady, do you know what time it is?

What is it, Grady?

I'm in love with your wife.
I'm in love with your wife.
Excuse me?
Excuse me?
Sara. I'm in love with her.
No.
Nevertheless, I'd like to see you in my office Monday morning.
No. I guess you're here for the backpack.
Oh... yeah.
Is it good?
I don't know. It might be...
Say, Professor Tripp, is all that stuff true about Errol Flynn? How he used to put coke on his dick. To make himself, you know, like, last longer?

Christ, Traxler. How the hell should I know?
Well, jeez, you're reading his biography, aren't you?
Oh, right. Yeah, that's true. He used to rub all kinds of things on it. Paprika. Ground lamb.
Sick.
Who's that guy?
Her husband.
What exactly are we doing here, Professor Tripp?
Taking the long way home.
Yo, Traxler.
Hey, Professor Tripp.
Do you get high, Sam?
Only when I'm working.
Holy shit. Are you serious?
As a heart attack.
As a heart attack.
Thanks -- Whoa, Professor Tripp, careful here...
Yes. He's a good kid. Maybe a little messed up.
Well, I'm sure with the proper guidance he'll be fine.
What made you pull out that old thing?
I was thinking of you.
I was thinking of you.
And?
And?
It's no Arsonist's Daughter, but I guess you know that. It's a young man's book. It got me remembering how it felt to be young.

Where's Emily, Hank?
I don't know if she'd want me to tell you that, Grady.

Ah, right. The book.
Listen, Hank, I'm sorry about all this. I didn't come here to upset you and Irene. I want you to know that.
Why did you come here, Grady?
I -- just wanted to see her, I guess -- Emily. And to see you too -- you and Irene. And to let everyone know that, even though it may be difficult to comprehend now, this -- everything that's happening -- it's not forever. It doesn't mean "Goodbye."
Give me a break, Grady.
Well, there's always people you don't know at these things, but I can't say there was anybody particularly suspicious... Wait. There was one guy. Tiny fella. Claimed to be a jockey.
A jockey? You mean, like --

One other thing. About this kid, this student of yours -- Leer -- James Leer. You wouldn't know how I could get in touch with him, would you?
I might have his number on campus.

That's all right. We'll find him.

Pills. August 25, 1972. In a Costa Brava hotel room.
There's so many...
Just a few then. The big ones.
Pier Angeli, 1971 or '72, also pills. Charles Boyer, 1978, pills again. Charles Butterworth, 1946, I think. In a car. Supposedly it was an accident, but, you know... He was distraught. Dorothy Dandridge, she took pills in, like, 1965. Albert Dekker, 1968, he hung himself. He wrote his suicide note in lipstick on his stomach. Alan Ladd, '64, more pills, Carole Landis, pills again,
I haven't heard of half of those.
I could swear I had a '63 Chateau Latour in here. You haven't seen it, have you?
I doubt I'd recognize a '63 Chateau Latour if I was sitting on it.

Booming. Lots of building going on. We can't keep up with all the work. In fact, I just hired a few new guys...
I'll never forget you got me started there.
I just recommended you. You still had to prove yourself.
Hey, is that a school?
K through sixth.
Living across the street from a grade school. Jesus.
Something wrong with that?

I was just thinking of... the noise.

One hundred and twenty feet.

Law says I can't come within one hundred feet of where children congregate. I figure the distance from my window to the school is one hundred and twenty. Make a bet?

No way, man, you'd rob me blind!
But maybe it's not so healthy being so close, you know, to a school.
You find me a decent place for under three hundred a month in this town, and I'll happily move out of this crap neighborhood.
I should go. Your sister worries, and when she worries she yells.
How is she?

Oh, Anna's. It was great, man. Anna was so pretty. She looked like a princess, like one of those girls in a fairy tale, you know, like Snow White.
I've got some pictures. Want to see?
No thanks.

Ah, come on.

Carlos, I never raped a woman.
Carlos, I never raped a woman.
I know. I'm just saying I understand.
It's crazy out there. Young girls wearing mini this and mini that. Sometimes when I walk down the street and pass some sexy looking woman, she makes me feel like I'm bothering her. She stares down like she's afraid to look at me. Why she do that? Why can't she look me in the face?
Maybe because you're looking her in the face.
Carlos, can I ask you something?
Sure.

Nothing.

You can't talk to me like --

Like a piece of shit? In my eyes, you are a piece of shit. Think anyone would miss you if I threw you out the window right now? I could say you jumped when I came in. Who are they going to believe? Not you, because you'd be a dead piece of shit.
Okay?
Okay.
Too much sun.
What?
Your ivy. Too much direct sunlight. These plants don't like a lot of sun.
They grow outside, don't they?
They grow outside, don't they?
Sure they do. But outside they've got trees around them. The trees shade them from the sun. Of course, the plants enrich the soil around the trees. One of nature's symbiotic relationships.

This one guy on death row, who I'll call Henry, told me about his last victim. Henry says how he's in the bedroom of a seven-year-old cutie named Adele. Her mother's in the living room watching TV.

By reflection we can derive a deeper meaning from our experience in life. We gain greater understanding about ourselves that can lead to making better choices in our relationships, our careers, and our goals.
Try it.
No fucking way.

Then think about it.
How's the journal?
I'm still thinking about it.

Here's this nice, hard working guy who suddenly appears out of the blue and rides the bus to and from work. I mean, who rides the bus anymore?

Did I say something wrong?
I suffer from insomnia.

Yeah.
So, what did you do?
I molested little girls.
I molested little girls.
Molested little girls?

Twelve years in prison is no joke.
Look, you can go now.
How many girls did you molest?
Sorry.
What did you do to them?
What did you do to them?
It's not what you think.
It's not what you think.
How young?
How young?
Between ten and twelve. Once a nine- year-old told me she was eleven. Once a fourteen-year-old told me she was twelve. I always asked how old they were.
I never hurt them. Never.
Twelve years in prison?
Twelve years in prison?
The judge had a thing about sex offenders. Later I heard his daughter had been raped. If I hadn't had a good lawyer, it would have been twenty- five to thirty.
Why don't you just go now, okay?
I told you I'm not easily shocked.

You should be shocked. Or do you get off on this shit?

No. Never again.
What was prison like?
You don't really --
You don't really --
Yes! I want to know.
You mean the time you're locked away?

I'm sorry, Walter.
I'm sorry, Walter.
Don't be sorry for me. I did those things. No one else did. I'm dealing with that.
My father took me fishing here when I was a kid. He could name every fish in the lake. And for every fish he named, he had a fishing story. I hated fishing, but I loved his stories.
Sounds like a special guy.

My father was an alcoholic who drank himself right into the grave.

I love my brothers.

No you don't.
No you don't.
I love all of them. They're strong, gentle men with families of their own. And if you asked them about what they did to me, they'd call you a fucking liar and then beat the shit out of you.

Thank you.
You're such an asshole.
Don't be scared, Walter.
I'm not scared.

Where're you?
Gimme a three-eighths socket on a long extension. So there you were--

We're being asked to cooperate in a matter of national security. Now you know exactly as much as I do. So just get your gear off and get up to control. There's some kind of briefing in ten minutes.
How you guys doing?

You got it?! You got it?
Yeah, yeah... yeah. It's turning.
Benthic Explorer, Benthic Explorer. Do you read, over? This is Deepcore--

Kirkhill? That guy doesn't know his butt from a rathole. Hey, Perry!
What's goin' on, Boss?
Folks, I've just been told to shut down the hole and prepare to move the rig.
Okay so far.

Yeah, okay. Okay.
Thanks. How you feeling, big guy?

I can't believe you were dumb enough to come down. Now you're stuck here for the storm... dumb, hot-rod... dumb.
Look, I didn't come down here to fight.
You need me. Nobody knows the systems on this rig better than I do. What is something was to go wrong after the Explorer clears off? What would have you done?
Wow, you're right! Us poor dumb ol' boys might've had to think for ourselves. Coulda been a disaster.
You wanna know what I think?
Not particularly. Jeez, look where this is set! Morons.
I think you were worried about me.
That must be it.

I haven't worn mine in months.
Yeah, what's-his-name wouldn't like it. The Suit.
Yeah, what's-his-name wouldn't like it. The Suit.

I'll tell you what happened... you woke up one day and realized the guy never made you laugh.
You're right, Bud. It was just that simple. Aren't you clever? You should get your own show... Ask Dr. Bud, advice to the lovelorn from three hundred fathoms.
Did you get anything on the cameras. Video or anything?
No. Look, forget it. I don't want to talk about it.
No. Look, forget it. I don't want to talk about it.

Hippy, just relax. You're making the women nervous.
Cute, Virgil.
What's the scoop, ace?
I can get power to this module and sub-bay if I remote these busses. I've gotta get past the mains, which are a total melt-down.
Need some help?
Thanks. No, I can handle it. Bud... there won't be enough to run the heaters. In a couple hours this place is going to be as cold as a meat locker.

Hey, Lins... I'm glad your here.
Yeah? Well I'm not.
Come on, you guys... look, this is the little one right here. You can see how it's kind of zigging around.
If you say so. It could be anything.
If you say so. It could be anything.
I'm telling you what is there. You're just not hearing. The impulses somehow aren't getting from you ears to your brainpan. There's something down there. Something not... us.

I need you to believe me, Bud. Look at me. Do I seem stressed out? Any of the symptoms of pressure sickness, any tremors, slurred speech?
I need you to believe me, Bud. Look at me. Do I seem stressed out? Any of the symptoms of pressure sickness, any tremors, slurred speech?
No.
No.
Bud, this is me, Lindsey. Okay? You know me better than anybody in the world. Now watch my lips... I saw these things. I touched one of them. And it wasn't some clunky steel can like we would build... it glided. It was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
It was a machine, but it seems almost alive. Like a... dance of light. Bud, you have to trust me... please. I don't think they mean us harm. I don't know how I know that, it's just a feeling.
How can I go on a feeling? You think Coffey's going to go on you 'feeling'?
How can I go on a feeling? You think Coffey's going to go on you 'feeling'?
We all see what we want to see... Coffey looks and he sees Russians, he sees hate and fear. Bud, you have to look with better eyes than that.
Look, goddamnit, if you won't do something about it, I will.
Lindsey! Wait a second--
You dumb jarhead motherf--
Chill out, Lindsey!!
He's got the shakes?
Look, the guy's operating on his own, cut off from chain of command. He's exhibiting symptoms of pressure-induced psychosis. And he's got a nuclear weapon. So, as a personal favor to me... will you put your tongue in neutral for a while?
I think it likes you.
It's trying to communicate.
They must've learned how to control water... I mean at a molecular level. They can plasticize it, polymerize it... whatever. Put it under intelligent control.
Maybe their whole technology is based on that. Controlling water.
He's jammed the mechanism.
Now what?
Okay, I'm gonna free-swim to hatch six... get inside, get the door open from the other side.
Bud, that water's only a couple degrees above freezing.
Bud, that water's only a couple degrees above freezing.
Then I guess you better wish me luck, huh?
You owe me one, Virgil.
Can we negotiate later? There's Big Geek.
You did okay, back there. I was fairly impressed.
Not good enough. We still gotta catch Big Geek.
Not good enough. We still gotta catch Big Geek.
Not in this thing.
You totaled it, huh?
Yeah. So sue me.
It's flooding like a son of the bitch.
You noticed.
Try again.
Deepcore, this is Cab One. We need assistance, over. Deepcore, this--
Well, that's that.
Wonderful. There's some light from somewhere...
Good hundred yards, I'd say.
They'll come out after us.
They'll come out after us.
Yeah, but it's gonna take them a while to find us. We better get this flooding stopped.
You see where it's coming in?
Somewhere behind this panel. Hold this.
Can't get to it. Have to pull this panel off. You go any tools?
I don't know, look around.
Son of a bitch!
Calm down, Bud.
Okay... okay. We gotta get you out of here.
How?
How?
I don't know how!
I don't know how!
We've only got one suit.
We've only got one suit.
I know! I know! But we better come up with something.
I know! I know! But we better come up with something.
Aaargh!! I'm freezing!
Okay, look, you swim to the rig and come back with another suit.
Seven, eight minute swim each way... not enough time. Look at this... Time I get back you'll be--
Alright, put this on.
What, you growing gills all of a sudden? You got it on, keep it on.
What, you growing gills all of a sudden? You got it on, keep it on.
Don't argue, goddamnit, just--
Don't argue, goddamnit, just--
No way! Forget it. Not an option.
Lindsey, just put the thing on and shut up--
NO!! Now be logical, Bud, you're--
NO!! Now be logical, Bud, you're--
FUCK LOGIC!!
Listen... will you listen to me for a second!? You're for the suit on and you're a better swimmer than me. Right? So I got a plan...
What's the plan?
What's the plan?
I drown, you tow me back to the rig--
I drown, you tow me back to the rig--
WHAT KIND OF PLAN IS THAT!??
It is insane.
It's the only way, Bud. Now trust me.
Oh God, Lins... I--
Tell me later.
Hey... big boys don't cry, remember?
Hi, lady.
Hi, lady.
Hi, tough guy. I guess it worked, huh?
Hi, tough guy. I guess it worked, huh?
'Course is worked. You're never wrong, are you? How d'you feel.
'Course is worked. You're never wrong, are you? How d'you feel.
I've been better. Next time it's your turn, okay?
No, Bud, no... not you.
Who then?
Hello, Brigman.
Hello, Mrs. Brigman.
We'll take reading as we go. If the reactor's breached or the warheads have released radioactive debris, we'll back away. Simple.
Okay... Hippy's not going... McWhirter, you can run Little Geek.
Look, it's three AM. These guys are running on bad coffee and four hours sleep. You better start cutting them some slack.
I can't afford slack, Brigman.
I can't afford slack, Brigman.
Hey, you come on my rig, you don't talk to me, you start ordering my guys around. It won't work. You gotta know how to handle these people... we have a certain way of doing things here.
Hey, you come on my rig, you don't talk to me, you start ordering my guys around. It won't work. You gotta know how to handle these people... we have a certain way of doing things here.
I'm not interested in your way of doing things. Just get your team ready to dive.
We'll go in through that large breach.
Let's go, guys.
Coffey, we're a little pressed for time.
Monk, Schoenick... secure the package.
Did you find Wilhite?
No.
Virgil?
God, I hate that bitch.
God, I hate that bitch.
Yeah, well you never should have married her then.
Just get around so your lights are on the hatch.
Check. Then I just hang with these guys, right?
What's the matter with you?
Now we're right in the middle of this big-time international incident. Like the Cuban Missile Crisis or something.
No, I mean it. Those SEALs aren't telling us diddly. Something's going on.
Hippy, you think everything's a conspiracy.
Hippy, you think everything's a conspiracy.
Everything is.
That's Perry.
That's it then. Finler, McWhirter, Dietz, and Perry. Jesus.
That's it then. Finler, McWhirter, Dietz, and Perry. Jesus.
Do we just leave him there?
Do we just leave him there?
Yeah, for now. Our first priority's to get something to breathe.
Come on, man. What else could it be?
Why bring it here?
Why bring it here?
It's gotta be, like, an emergency plan to keep it away from the Russians... Hotwire one of the nukes with some kinda detonator, put it back in the sub, and fry the whole thing, slicker'n snot. Oh, uh... hi, Lins.
Lins, stay away from that guy. I mean it.
Yeah. The dude's in bad shape... you see his hands?
Go to the infirmary... get the cart .. oxygen... de-fib kit... adrenaline in a... ten cc syringe... and some... heating blankets. You got all that?
Got it. Over.
Got it. Over.
Meet me in the moonpool. Move fast.
Is that it? Is this right?
Yeah! I mean, I don't know... it looks right.
Yeah! I mean, I don't know... it looks right.
All right. Do it!
Hey, you guys are milking that job.
That's cause we love freezin' our butts off out here sooo much, boss.
Triple time sounds like a lotta money, Bud. It ain't. I'm sorry...
We're here now. Let's get her done.
He's convulsing!
It's his mixture! Too much oxygen!
'Fish'?
Yuh?
Yuh?
Take the first watch in sonar. Hippy, you handle the exterior surveillance. One Night, see if you can get that transmitter working for me, okay?
Hafta... go on to... the moonpool. Only way.
I can't... make it... podner.
Howdy, y'all. Hey, Lindsey! I'll be damned! You shouldn't be down here sweet thing, ya'll might run ya stockings.
Couldn't stay away. You running mixture for us? Good. Couldn't ask for better.
Couldn't stay away. You running mixture for us? Good. Couldn't ask for better.
Okay, here we go. Start equalizing, y'all.
Cat, you tie onto this manifold. There's some tanks on the other side; I'm gonna go check them out.
You watch yourself.
You better not say you missed that.
Missed what?
Y'all could be more specific.
Not us. Not human. Get it? Something non- human, but intelligent...
I think they're from 'you know'. Some place that has similar conditions... cold, intense pressure. No light.
Happy as hogs in a waller down there, prob'ly.
We should be dead. We didn't decompress.
Out blood oughta be fizzin' like a warm, shook- up Coke.
Those guys ain't so tough. I fought plenty of guys tougher'n them.
Now we get to hear about how he used to be a contender.
Hippy, you pussy.
What good's the money if your dick drops off in six months?
Quiet! Quiet!
Turn it up, bozo.
Are we talkin' little space friend here?
Right on! Hot rods of the Gods. Right, Lins? Hey, no really! It could be NTIs. The CIA has known about them for years. They abduct people all the time. There was this woman I knew in Albuquerque who--
That thing was probably their version of Big Geek... like an ROV.
Just checking is out, huh? How come?
SHIT!
Give me that!!
Lady, we better fish or cut bait.
Just hold your water, okay? So Kirkhill, we gonna do this or we gonna talk about it?
Get comfortable. The bad news is we got six hours in this can, blowing down. The worse news is it's gonna take us three weeks to decompress back to the surface later.
We've been fully briefed, Mrs. Brigman.
We've been fully briefed, Mrs. Brigman.
Don't call me that, okay... I hate that. Alright, from now on we watch each other closely for signs of HPNS...
Look, we've all made chamber runs to this depth. We're checked out.
Oh... chamber runs. Uh huh, that's good. Well, hey... you guys know any songs?
Cab One, do you see it yet?
The magnetometer is pegged. Side-scan is showing a big return, but I don't see anything yet. Are you sure you got the depth right on this?
Cab One, radiation readings?
Neutron counter's not showing very much.
Neutron counter's not showing very much.
Wilhite, anything?
Copy that, continuing forward. You just want me to get shots of everything, right?
Roger, document as much as you can, but keep moving. We're on a tight timeline.
Roger, document as much as you can, but keep moving. We're on a tight timeline.
Copy that.
Radiation is nominal. The warheads must still be intact.
How many are there?
How many are there?
24 Trident missiles. Eight MIRVs per missile.
24 Trident missiles. Eight MIRVs per missile.
That's 192 warheads... And how powerful are they?
I want 'round-the-clock manning of the sonar shack and the exterior cameras. We need early warning if the Soviet craft try another incursion.
Gimme a break! Coffey, these things live three and a half miles down on the bottom of an abyssal trench! Trust me... they're not speaking Russian.
You've got some huevos bringing this... thing... into my rig! With everything that's been going on up in the world, you bring a nuclear weapon in here? Does this strike anyone as particularly psychotic, or is it just me?
You don't need to know the details of this mission... you're better off if you don't.
You don't need to know the details of this mission... you're better off if you don't.
You're right... I don't. I just need to know that this thing is out of here! You hear me, Roger Ramjet?
You're right... I don't. I just need to know that this thing is out of here! You hear me, Roger Ramjet?
Mrs. Brigman, you're becoming a serious impediment to this mission. I believe the stress is affecting you. Escort her to quarters and have Monk prepare a tranquilizer.
Deepcore, Deepcore... this is Cab Three on final approach.
Gotcha, Cab Three. Who is that? That You, Lindsey?
Cab Three, check. Right behind you.
What's you depth, Cab Three?
What's you depth, Cab Three?
1840... 50... 60... 70...
1840... 50... 60... 70...
Going over the wall. Coming to bearing 065. Everybody stay tight and in sight.
Figured that out for yourself, did you?
We got Russian subs creeping around. Shit! Something goes wrong they could say anything happened down here, man. Give our folks medals, know what I mean?
A non-terrestrial intelligence.
Non-Terrestrial Intelligence. NTIs. Yeah, I like that better then UFOs. Although that works too... Underwater Flying Objects.
Look, you can just punch into his little chip where you want him to go, and he goes, right?
Well, yeah, but the tether off it ain't gonna be fancy. When he gets down there he'll just sit, like a dumb-shit. Unless something wanders through view of the camera, you'll get nada.
Well, yeah, but the tether off it ain't gonna be fancy. When he gets down there he'll just sit, like a dumb-shit. Unless something wanders through view of the camera, you'll get nada.
Let's go for it. We could get lucky.
No. Just you and me. We get some proof, then tell them. Hippy, look... if was can prove to Coffey it's not Russians, maybe he'll ease off the button a little.
I gotta tell you, that guy scares me a lot more than whatever's down there. A.J. Squared Away goddamn jarhead robot. Okay, gimme a couple hours on this.
Schoenick... your Lieutenant is about to make a real bad career move...
That guy's crazier'n a shithouse rat!
He can't get to the door... I think he's going to try and take him himself.
He couldn't be that dumb. The guy's a trained killer. Bud's idea of a fight is arm-wrestling One Night over laundry duty.
12000 feet. Jesus, I don't believe he's doing this.
Shut up, Hippy. Bud, how you doing?
Uh, oh...
What kind of luminous things, Bud?
Fluid breathing system. We just got them. We use it if we need to go really deep.
How deep?
How deep?
Deep. It's classified... you know. Anyway, you breathe liquid, so you can't be compressed. Pressure doesn't get to you.
Hey!
Check this out.
Stand by on the ROV.
Perry, stand by on the ROV. Sorry about this, little buddy. Better you than me, know what I mean?
Getting a reading?
It's twitching but it's below the line you said was safe.
You boss is having a full-on meltdown. Guy's fixing to pull the pin on fifty kilotons and we're all ringside!
What's the timer set for?
High-Pressure Nervous Syndrome. Muscle tremors, usually in the hands first. Nausea, increased excitability, disorientation.
Very good. About one person in twenty just can't handle it. They go buggo. They're no way to predict who's susceptible, so stay alert.
4800 feet. It's official.
Bud, according to Monk here, you just set a record for the deepest suit dive. Bet you didn't think you'd be doing this when you got up this morning.
8500 feet, Bud. Everything okay?
Ask him a pressure effects. Tremors, vision problems, euphoria.
Ask him a pressure effects. Tremors, vision problems, euphoria.
Ensign Monk want to know how you feel.
He's losing it. Talk to him. Keep him with us.
Bud, it's the pressure. Try to concentrate. Concentrate on my voice. Just listen to my voice.
He can still make it.
I know how alone you feel... alone in all that cold blackness... but I'm there in the dark with you, Bud you're not alone...
What kind of light?
He's hallucinating badly.
Would we see the flash?
Through three miles of water? I don't know.
But your friend is waiting downstairs.
She'll wait.
When do you have to go back?
I don't know... It depends on Ettore... He's now in the process of negotiating for a contract here in Sicily...
I don't know... It depends on Ettore... He's now in the process of negotiating for a contract here in Sicily...
Then how come you're not with him?
Then how come you're not with him?
What a question... Because I want to be with you, naturally. I hope he doesn't close the deal so he'll leave me alone at least for a few days... Isn't this water wonderful!
I'd like to find a place where I can get some peace and rest, maybe around here somewhere. I'd like to try...
What could be more restful than this?... Excuse me, what is it that you want to try?
How are you?
Fine. Can't you see so yourself?
Anna... Maybe it would be better to wait a while.
Wait for what?
Sandro... A month is too long a time. I have become used to being without you.
You'll get over it soon. It's the usual anxiety.
You'll get over it soon. It's the usual anxiety.
A little more so this time.
A little more so this time.
So, it will just take you a little longer to get over it.
So, it will just take you a little longer to get over it.
But I think we should talk about it. Or are you fully convinced that we too won't understand each other?
But I think we should talk about it. Or are you fully convinced that we too won't understand each other?
There will be plenty of time to talk about it later. We'll get married soon. That way we'll have more time...
There will be plenty of time to talk about it later. We'll get married soon. That way we'll have more time...
In this case, getting married means nothing. Aren't we already the same as being married? And Corrado and Giulia -- aren't they already the same as being married?
In this case, getting married means nothing. Aren't we already the same as being married? And Corrado and Giulia -- aren't they already the same as being married?
But why rattle your brains by arguing and talking... Believe me, Anna, words never help at all. They only serve to confuse. I love you, Anna. Isn't I that enough?
But why rattle your brains by arguing and talking... Believe me, Anna, words never help at all. They only serve to confuse. I love you, Anna. Isn't I that enough?
No. It's not enough... I told you before that I would like to get away for a while and be alone.
No. It's not enough... I told you before that I would like to get away for a while and be alone.
But you just said that a month was too...
But you just said that a month was too...
I mean, to stay away longer -- two months... a year... three years... Yes, I know, it sounds absurd. And I feel awful. The very idea of losing you makes me want to die... And yet... I... I just don't have the same feeling for you any more.
I mean, to stay away longer -- two months... a year... three years... Yes, I know, it sounds absurd. And I feel awful. The very idea of losing you makes me want to die... And yet... I... I just don't have the same feeling for you any more.
And what about yesterday... at my house... didn't you have any feeling for me, even then?
And what about yesterday... at my house... didn't you have any feeling for me, even then?
There you go... Must you always spoil everything!
But where are you going?
I'm thirsty.
I'm thirsty.
If I had a man waiting for me for half an hour and whom I hadn't seen for a month ...
You know, I could just as well go without seeing him today.
What! After giving us such a run around...
Did you sleep well?
Yes, fairly well. But I went to bed last night planning to do some thinking about a number of things ... instead, I fell asleep.
Yes, fairly well. But I went to bed last night planning to do some thinking about a number of things ... instead, I fell asleep.
I didn't know one could sleep so well on a yacht. It lulls you ...
Which one shall I wear?
This one is gorgeous.
This one is gorgeous.
Then why don't you try it on?
Claudia, aren't you coming?
I'm certainly not going to swim across.
I'm certainly not going to swim across.
We'll send the raft back to you.
Isn't it fashionable any more to put on a sailor's cap with the name of the yacht?
No, Dad, it isn't.
And how long will you be away?
Four or five days.
Four or five days.
Oh, very well. I'll just spend the weekend alone by myself and take a little rest. I should be used to it by now.
Used to what?
To the fact of my retirement, not only as a diplomat but also as a father.
To the fact of my retirement, not only as a diplomat but also as a father.
But how could you say such a thing?
But how could you say such a thing?
Because it's true. After thirty years -- not having ever spoken the truth to anyone, I should at least allow myself to do so with my own daughter.
Because it's true. After thirty years -- not having ever spoken the truth to anyone, I should at least allow myself to do so with my own daughter.
And have you any other truths to tell me?
And have you any other truths to tell me?
You already know what they are.
You already know what they are.
You mean Sandro, don't you? Well, I beg of you, please, spare me that. Goodbye, Dad.
Up until now, Dad, I've been the one who hasn't wanted to marry him.
It's the same thing. Goodbye, dear.
I presume by this method that you'll be able to uncover some new clue, either a handkerchief or an article of clothing... In other words, something which your men have not been able to find as yet.
Without any doubt, sir. If anything belonging to the girl who has run away is still here on this island...
Without any doubt, sir. If anything belonging to the girl who has run away is still here on this island...
Allow me to inform you that my daughter is not a fugitive.
Allow me to inform you that my daughter is not a fugitive.
I'm sorry, sir. I didn't mean to put it that way. But, you must understand, sir, that I...
I'm sorry, sir. I didn't mean to put it that way. But, you must understand, sir, that I...
I understand very well. Only I don't want any rash assumptions to be made.
This looks to me like a good sign. Don't you think so? As far as I'm concerned, anyone who reads the Bible could not have committed an act of impropriety. Why... as a matter of fact, I remember when I was in China, many years ago, I happened to be involved in a similar situation, concerning an English woman, the wife of Ambassador Shafford,
Sir, if you have no objections, may we start the search?
It's already two hours... What are we going to do?
It takes about twenty to twenty-two hours for the current to reach here from Lisca Bianca.
These people are contemptible. They have no sense of dignity at all.
And you say that came from Lisca Bianca?
And you say that came from Lisca Bianca?
It couldn't have come from anywhere else. At least, somewhere from that vicinity... But I really can't understand it. Contraband cigarettes on that island! It's the first time that ever happened.
It couldn't have come from anywhere else. At least, somewhere from that vicinity... But I really can't understand it. Contraband cigarettes on that island! It's the first time that ever happened.
Look... I'd like to get back to Lisca Bianca.
Look... I'd like to get back to Lisca Bianca.
But how could we...at a time like this when we just... well, let's at least first have a look around the other islands. Could be that something might turn up there.
But how could we...at a time like this when we just... well, let's at least first have a look around the other islands. Could be that something might turn up there.
But even here we were supposed to find who knows what... And all we bring back with us is a crate of cigarettes.
But even here we were supposed to find who knows what... And all we bring back with us is a crate of cigarettes.
As you wish.
What is that one over there called?
That must be Basiluzzo.
That must be Basiluzzo.
Sounds like the name of a fish -- merluzzo, basiluzzo...
Say, Claudia, wouldn't you like to climb up with me and take a look over there?
At what?
At what?
At the ruins. They're very ancient, you know.
Well?
Well, what?
Well, what?
Have you decided?
Have you decided?
All I said was that it sounds like a good idea.
How wonderful!
That's Patrizia's way of letting us know she's with us.
I think you're very sweet, Corrado.
More so than the shark?
More so than the shark?
There's no comparison.
There's no comparison.
Then why don't we go up and see the ruins?
Somebody must live here!
But Anna wouldn't be staying with the kind of people who live here.
Really! Still, it remains to be seen why she invented a shark. What was her purpose in that?
Maybe you'd better ask him.
Maybe you'd better ask him.
What were you and Anna arguing about?... Excuse me for being so indiscreet, but this is serious...
I have a feeling that you're not used to being alone.
That seems to apply to you also...
Don't be so humble.
How should I be ... arrogant?
How should I be ... arrogant?
But of course... arrogant, haughty... Hasn't Anna ever told you?
There's nothing much to laugh at.
And that's what I say, too. We could have all been killed.
Shall we go for a swim?
Oh, no... please... not here. It looks too dangerous.
Twelve years ... But why haven't they married?
And why haven't they left each other?
And why haven't they left each other?
I'm beginning to have my doubts. It couldn't be that they're in love?
I'm beginning to have my doubts. It couldn't be that they're in love?
Could be. They're the kind of people who are capable of anything.
Find anything?
No.
As far as I'm concerned, I think she's alive... Why, even this morning... that business about the shark... it wasn't at all true.
And why do you tell us this only now?
And why do you tell us this only now?
I... I don't know... I didn't think it was worthwhile... She was laughing over it...
Nothing but the usual argument... The only thing was -- if I remember correctly -- that she said she had a need to be alone.
And how do you explain that?
Nothing... nothing at all!
But why don't you tell him? A girl who was with us has disappeared.
And I suppose it's my fault... Why don't you tell him that too. That's what you believe, isn't it?
Rather than being so occupied with my thoughts, you would have been better off trying to understand what Anna was thinking.
Are you feeling better?
I'm sorry about last night. Please forgive me.
I'm sorry about last night. Please forgive me.
You're very fond of Anna, aren't you?
You're very fond of Anna, aren't you?
Yes, very much so.
Yes, very much so.
Has she ever spoken to you about me?
Has she ever spoken to you about me?
Occasionally, but always with affection.
Occasionally, but always with affection.
And yet, she seemed to feel that our love for her -- mine, yours, even her father's, in a certain sense -- weren't enough for her, or didn't mean much to her.
And yet, she seemed to feel that our love for her -- mine, yours, even her father's, in a certain sense -- weren't enough for her, or didn't mean much to her.
I know. I keep asking myself what I could have done to prevent all this from happening.
I think that you might go and have a look yourself.
Yes, maybe that is better.
Where are you going?... To Montaldo's?
Yes.
Yes.
Then I'll go with you.
Have you read it?... They're asking for anyone with information to get in touch with them.
Yes. I had also thought of going there to talk with them...
Yes. I had also thought of going there to talk with them...
Yes, you should go.
Yes, you should go.
But then when will we see each other?
Sandro, I don't want you to come with me, I don't want to see you... How can I make it clear to you?...Why did you come?
I don't know why. I just couldn't help it.
I don't know why. I just couldn't help it.
But sooner or later we've got to end this relationship. And it's better to do it right now.
But sooner or later we've got to end this relationship. And it's better to do it right now.
I have no desire to sacrifice myself... It's idiotic to sacrifice oneself... Why?... For whom? If Anna were here I might understand your scruples. But she's not...
I have no desire to sacrifice myself... It's idiotic to sacrifice oneself... Why?... For whom? If Anna were here I might understand your scruples. But she's not...
Oh, Sandro...
Oh, Sandro...
I'm sorry. I didn't want to sound cynical. But isn't it better to look things squarely in the eye?
I'm sorry. I didn't want to sound cynical. But isn't it better to look things squarely in the eye?
For me they are exactly as they were when we met three days ago -- just three days ago... don't you realize? And you and Anna... No, I guess they aren't like that any more. My God, is it possible to forget in such a short time, for things to change so quickly?

It takes even less.
It takes even less.
But it's so sad. So terribly sad. I'm not used to it, I'm not ready for it... You know... I have never been so upset in my life. Sandro, why don't you help me?
But it's so sad. So terribly sad. I'm not used to it, I'm not ready for it... You know... I have never been so upset in my life. Sandro, why don't you help me?
I think the only way to help ourselves, Claudia, is for us to be together.
I think the only way to help ourselves, Claudia, is for us to be together.
No, I'm sure it won't. Move over there. Let's make believe nothing happened. And when we get to the next station, get off.
No, I'm sure it won't. Move over there. Let's make believe nothing happened. And when we get to the next station, get off.
And what about you?
And what about you?
Me... I... I... Please leave me alone.
Claudia, listen to me...
No, Sandro, please... I ask you as a favor...
Promise that you won't try to look for me... you shouldn't try to look for me any more...
But why, Claudia?... Why?
Any news?
Yes... but it's all so conflicting... However, there is some slight indication...
Let's get out of here, fast... This is not a town, it's a cemetery.
Who knows why they all left...
Sandro ... maybe it's best that you go in alone.
Are you joking?
Are you joking?
Don't think that I want to save myself from any embarrassment, from the awkwardness of meeting Anna... It's not that; it's that you can say certain things easier if you're alone. Please, Sandro, do try to understand me... It would look like I was trying to influence you, to force you, to control you... and that makes me feel uncomfortable...
What is it, Claudia?
Oh, Sandro... I'm so ashamed of myself, so ashamed...I tried to hide myself...I feel so small... I hate myself ...
Oh, Sandro... I'm so ashamed of myself, so ashamed...I tried to hide myself...I feel so small... I hate myself ...
Does it please you to say such things?
Does it please you to say such things?
Oh no... It doesn't please me at all...
Oh no... It doesn't please me at all...
Then why do you say them?
Then why do you say them?
Because what I'm doing is so ugly ... Because if you told me right now: "Claudia, I love you," I would believe you...
Good. It's better if it were absurd. That would mean nothing much can be done about it.
But just think -- the very same things you had said to her who knows how many times... maybe even just before we left, while I was waiting outside your place...
But just think -- the very same things you had said to her who knows how many times... maybe even just before we left, while I was waiting outside your place...
So, even if I did say them, I was sincere with her, as I am now with you.
Really, I've got to stop this business with Ettore... I would like to go back and start working on my own projects again. You know, I had many ideas...
And why did you drop them?
And why did you drop them?
Once they gave me a job to draw up an estimate for the construction of a school. It took me only a day and a half to finish it, and I got paid six million lire. Ever since then I've been doing estimates for other people's designs.
Why are you looking at me like that?
I'm sure you'd be able to design some very lovely things.
I'm sure you'd be able to design some very lovely things.
I don't know about that. And then, who's interested in beautiful things nowadays?
Claudia, let's get married?
What! Get married?
What! Get married?
Yes. We'll get married. You and I. What do you say?
Yes. We'll get married. You and I. What do you say?
What do I say? What can I say? No. At least, not yet. I don't know... I can't even think of it... at a time like this... Oh, but why did you have to ask me?
What do I say? What can I say? No. At least, not yet. I don't know... I can't even think of it... at a time like this... Oh, but why did you have to ask me?
You look at me as though I had said something foolish...
You look at me as though I had said something foolish...
And are you sure you want to marry me? Are you really sure...that you want to marry... me?
And are you sure you want to marry me? Are you really sure...that you want to marry... me?
That's why I asked you...
That's why I asked you...
So... Oh, how I wish that everything were so much simpler... that people could just come together by the color of their hair or the size of their shoes. What size shoe do you wear? Size 9. That's a very lovely size. But I'm sorry, I wear size 8.
But why am I so infatuated with you?
Hurry up now, or it'll begin to get hot outside...
Hurry up now, or it'll begin to get hot outside...
Yes, yes, yes, yes... Right away...
And you leave me here all alone... in this hotel room...
As soon as you're ready, you can come down and catch up with me. I'll be waiting for you right outside on the square.
But you know it already. Why must I tell you?
So, you wonder why?
Then I'll see you later.
Okay. In a few minutes.
Sandro ...What's the matter?
Nothing.
No, Sandro... Please...
Why?
Why?
No reason why...
Sandro, wait a moment, just one moment... You seem like an entirely different person ...
And aren't you pleased?... That way you'll have a new kind of adventure.
What are you saying?
I was only joking, really... Can't I make a joke? And now you've got to tell me why you don't want to.
I was only joking, really... Can't I make a joke? And now you've got to tell me why you don't want to.
Oh, Sandro... I want everything you do. But...
Did the hotel manager speak to you about that place nearby?
Yes, she started to but I didn't feel like staying to listen to what she had to say. If we had to listen to everybody...
Yes, she started to but I didn't feel like staying to listen to what she had to say. If we had to listen to everybody...
No, Sandro... We should go. Besides, we haven't been in touch with anybody. Not even with Anna's father. We should have at least sent a wire or telephoned... let's be fair, he must be feeling awfully lonely.
No, Sandro... We should go. Besides, we haven't been in touch with anybody. Not even with Anna's father. We should have at least sent a wire or telephoned... let's be fair, he must be feeling awfully lonely.
I don't doubt it. But at a time like this we're the least suitable persons to be with him. And as far as telephoning him... Who knows where he is?
Sandro, listen... Try not to get yourself too involved tomorrow.
Aren't you going to change?
Aren't you going to change?
You said you wanted to quit working for Ettore.
Sandro, I'm not coming down.
Why?
Why?
I'm too sleepy.
I'm too sleepy.
Sleep is something one must learn to overcome. I learned how to do it when I was a child. I never slept. And I had friends who even slept less than I did. The one who went to bed first, paid a penalty. And we really didn't do anything. After seeing a movie, we'd go to a cafe and discuss things for a while...
You're that sleepy, eh? What time do expect to get up tomorrow?
Late, very late.
Good night, my love.
Good night. Tell me that you love me.
Good night. Tell me that you love me.
I love you.
I love you.
Tell me once more.
Tell me once more.
I don't love you.
I don't love you.
I deserve it.
Well, with a shark running loose around the place, I for one won't get aboard that raft! They'll have to catch it first. I want to see it right here before my feet, dead or alive.
Better dead.
Tell me, Claudia, what do you think of Raimondo?
I would say he's pretty depraved.
I would say he's pretty depraved.
Oh no; quite the contrary. He's really just a child.
He amuses me. I don't know of anything more amusing. Outside of this jigsaw puzzle. Don't you find it so, Claudia?
One would have to be in love with somebody to know that.
One would have to be in love with somebody to know that.
Have you ever been in love?
Have you ever been in love?
Not really... It's suffocating in here... Shall we go out?
What amazes me, is Sandro. He seems so calm.
Calm?... He doesn't seem so to me... He was awake all night.
I'm going with the patrol boat to make a tour around the islands.
To do what?
To do what?
I just can't leave without first searching those islands, one by one.
I just can't leave without first searching those islands, one by one.
But aren't you tired? I can just about manage to stand on my feet! Raimondo!
But where did you finally end up?
It was futile. We went all over.
It's divine!
You say that just to flatter me.
You say that just to flatter me.
Do you consider that a compliment?
Do you consider that a compliment?
No.
I'm not coming.
But then why did you bother changing?
Shouldn't we try to find a quieter place?
Quieter? Oh, yes, of course.
How do you manage to put up with all this confusion? You always said people bore you.
You shouldn't always take me seriously. Actually, I'm used to it by now. First my mother and now my husband; both of them are like dynamos.
My childhood, instead, was a very sensible one.
What do you mean by sensible?
What do you mean by sensible?
It means being without money.
Patrizia... Patrizia ... Where's Ettore?
I imagine he must be inside sleeping.
I imagine he must be inside sleeping.
Would you please see if Sandro is with him? He's not in his room. I'm sorry to disturb you.
Patrizia, I'm afraid.
More or less, we are all afraid. Especially at night.
More or less, we are all afraid. Especially at night.
I'm afraid that Anna has come back. I feel she's back, and that they're together.
I'm afraid that Anna has come back. I feel she's back, and that they're together.
But what's gotten into you?... We would have known. Sandro must be out in the garden somewhere, taking a breath of fresh air, or watching the break of dawn. It would be a lovely surprise indeed if he turned out to be the sentimental type.
Now, listen. For God's sake, try not to let yourself become obsessed with that idea. Go to your room and get back into bed.
Just several days ago, the thought of Anna being dead would have made me sick. And now, I don't even cry, I'm afraid she might be alive. Everything is becoming so damned simple and easy, even to deprive one's self of pain and suffering.

You should never wish to get melodramatic over anything.
You should never wish to get melodramatic over anything.
Yes, you're right. I'm sick and tired of being like that.
Who are you talking to?
To the shark.
Please, you come too...
But for what reason should I come there?
But for what reason should I come there?
Please, do come... Don't leave me alone with him. He's capable of... I don't know... Have you noticed his eyes?
They're all nudes, if I'm not mistaken.
But why all nudes?
And tell Corrado, too, that I'm here... if he wants me. You can also tell him that my tiny little heart is beating like mad, and that at this moment, it's the only thing that interests me. Is that clear?
It couldn't be any clearer.
Now what do I have to do to be left in peace?
I think all you have to do, Giulia, is to close the door.
It's as smooth and slick as oil.
I detest comparisons made with oil.
At one time the Aeolian isles were all volcanoes.
You must know your third grade geography book inside out.
What happened?
There's a shark in the area. Don't move from where you are!
There's a shark in the area. Don't move from where you are!
Who's moving?
Why didn't you ask me to go with you?
Do you know why? Because if you saw those ruins I'm sure you would have said they were very, very beautiful. You always say "how beautiful" to everything -- whether it's the sea, or a baby, or a cat! You have such a sensitive little heart that it throbs for anything.

But Corrado... If something is beautiful why shouldn't one say so?

He never misses a chance to humiliate me, to let me know that he doesn't care about me any more.
He never misses a chance to humiliate me, to let me know that he doesn't care about me any more.
Giulia, that remark is not worthy of our twelve years of honest concubinage. I repeat, once and for all, and publicly, that I admire you. Does that please you?
Looks like the weather is changing.
Please, Giulia; must you always emphasize the obvious? I can see for myself that the weather is changing.
I'll stay here also.
But why?... What if it starts to rain?
But why?... What if it starts to rain?
If it rains, I'll buy myself an umbrella.
How did you spend the night?... In that hut?... And what did you have to eat?
What do you think?
What do you think?
We, too, you know. It was disastrous. First at Panarea, where there weren't any boats... then at Lipari, where everybody was asleep... And the phone call to Rome...
Corrado, why don't you ask them to give it to us as a gift?
Really! So that you can stuff it with your geraniums.
But how can you carry on a discussion in this heat?
When one approaches fifty, my dear, he is affected only by the cold.
I'm going ashore to take a look around the island. There are some ruins up there...
There too...
There too...
Well, we're still in Italy, you know!
It's really a fact -- there's nothing new under the sun. Now, look here. Look at this structure... a kind of natural shelter. Sandro, that's how you should design your houses.
Me?... I no longer have any interest in building... And, then, where can you find boulders of rock like this in Milan?
Let's try to be practical about this. The best thing to do is for all of you to go to the closest island that has a police station, or something, and report the disappearance. I'll remain here... because... well, I don't know, but it seems to me that something may turn up. Anyway, I just don't feel like leaving.
Then let's get started... It's senseless to waste any more time.
Claudia, I know how you feel, but there are already two of us staying...
I'll go even further and say that her presence here -- I don't want to sound offensive -- could be a great hindrance.
And what are we going to do now?
We'll try again.
Up until now those smugglers were operating only around the Palermo area. This will be a nice surprise for the Lieutenant in Milazzo... Call up headquarters. Bring them up to date and have them give you instructions on what to do with this crate.
So... the boat we saw yesterday afternoon might have also been that of these smugglers. Could it be possible, then, that Anna...?
So... the boat we saw yesterday afternoon might have also been that of these smugglers. Could it be possible, then, that Anna...?
I wonder where they could have unloaded the stuff ... Maybe right here at Lisca.
I wonder where they could have unloaded the stuff ... Maybe right here at Lisca.
I was saying... it might even be possible that Anna had left with them.
I was saying... it might even be possible that Anna had left with them.
But for what reason would she have wanted to go away?
But for what reason would she have wanted to go away?
Listen, Marshal... As for there being reasons for going away, anyone of us might have three thousand of them. So you can assume that she had them. What I want to know, is it possible that the smugglers might have taken her aboard?
Listen, Marshal... As for there being reasons for going away, anyone of us might have three thousand of them. So you can assume that she had them. What I want to know, is it possible that the smugglers might have taken her aboard?
I think it's possible.
And who is this?
This is Claudia, Anna's friend... You've never met my husband, have you?
First let the poor thing have something to eat.
It wouldn't really do you any harm to skip a meal.
Ettore...
What is it?
What is it?
Nothing, nothing at all. I was just looking for Sandro.
Nothing, nothing at all. I was just looking for Sandro.
And you expect to find him in here? Go and ask Claudia.
And you expect to find him in here? Go and ask Claudia.
Yes, yes, of course.
Let's see you dive from the top of those rocks, Giulia. That would be really sensational. Come on, Giulia ... your life is much too circumscribed.
What has everybody got against me this morning?
Where is she going?
Ask her.
The trouble with you is that nobody can speak to you, that's all.
Giulia, don't you understand that the more involved you become with people, the more difficult it is to speak with them?
Giulia, don't you understand that the more involved you become with people, the more difficult it is to speak with them?
You men are all so dreadful!
You men are all so dreadful!
I know we are. But as the years go by, we become even worse. Isn't that so, Corrado?
Goffredo is the Princess' nephew. He's eighteen years old, the lucky boy. And, what do you know -- he paints.
Anybody can hold a brush in his hand. All you need is to buy some oils and start painting. Even Rembrandt did the same.
Giulia...
Here I am.
Because there is no landscape as beautiful as a woman.
And where do you find the models?
And where do you find the models?
Oh, there are as many as one wants.
Oh, there are as many as one wants.
I thought the model was something obsolete nowadays. Didn't you, Claudia?
It's strange how anxious women are to display themselves. It's almost a natural inclination.
But how could they pose like that? I couldn't.
But how could they pose like that? I couldn't.
Why don't you try?
Why don't you try?
Me... Goffredo, you're mad! He's mad.
Don't you ever paint men?
Answer me, why don't you try posing? I'll paint you a beautiful portrait.
Answer me, why don't you try posing? I'll paint you a beautiful portrait.
But why me?... Ask Claudia, she's much more beautiful than me.
But why me?... Ask Claudia, she's much more beautiful than me.
But I want to paint you. You appeal to me more.
But I want to paint you. You appeal to me more.
I appeal to you more?
They tell me you have a lot of trouble at home. Is that right?
Yes, sir. My sister is sick... and my father, too.
Yes, sir. My sister is sick... and my father, too.
So that's why you've turned to smuggling, eh? You need the money. Now, I can help you. I can see that you get some assistance from the government. But first there's a little formality we've got to take care of. Just a few questions and then we can all go to lunch... Your friend tells me you dropped anchor three times...
Yes, sir. Three times.
Now, we're getting somewhere! They're beginning to contradict each other. Now look here, your friend just swore to me that you weren't able to do any fishing at all because the sea was too rough... And what about the other boat?
Now, we're getting somewhere! They're beginning to contradict each other. Now look here, your friend just swore to me that you weren't able to do any fishing at all because the sea was too rough... And what about the other boat?
What other boat?
What other boat?
Now look, my men saw it and they also saw you men throwing those crates overboard. What have you got to say about that?
Now look, my men saw it and they also saw you men throwing those crates overboard. What have you got to say about that?
I ... I ... wasn't feeling well ... I.. I was sleeping... I don't know anything ... I ... I'm all mixed up and ...
I work there but I'm really a stranger.
I tell you this acquaintance of mine knows you and she has often spoken to me about you.
I tell you this acquaintance of mine knows you and she has often spoken to me about you.
And who is she? Does she work in Catania?
And who is she? Does she work in Catania?
Yes, she takes care of the garden.
Yes, she takes care of the garden.
Then it's impossible for her to know me. In the villa where I'm at, we have a male gardener.
Then it's impossible for her to know me. In the villa where I'm at, we have a male gardener.
So? That's logical. You see, both being gardeners, they spoke about you to one another.
So? That's logical. You see, both being gardeners, they spoke about you to one another.
And what did they say about me?
And what did they say about me?
They told me that you were a very nice girl, that you always mind your business... In other words, things of that sort.
We have a radio like this, too.
No, not like this one.
No, not like this one.
And why wouldn't we have one like this?
And why wouldn't we have one like this?
Because this is a Chinese radio.
Certainly a radio this small is very practical. It's especially useful for... I don't know... for traveling.
But for you, what comes first: music or love?
Music, of course. To get a sweetheart, one has to look around, but to get a radio, all you have to do is buy one.
Ah, no... For me, love comes first. I'm a man, and I know what's what: first love, and then music.
Anything new develop?
Unfortunately, no.
Unfortunately, no.
Very well. First of all, I'll have them search the waters around the island. I brought two frogmen with me... Meanwhile, we'll take a look up around here.

Look, Marshal, with those deep crevasses, you'll need some rope and ladders...

Another thing; there's an old man who lives here on the island...
Another thing; there's an old man who lives here on the island...
I know, I know. One thing at a time.
I only exchanged a few casual words with her, as one would ordinarily do on a public bus...
And do you remember where she got off?
And do you remember where she got off?
Well...probably at the last stop, which is Noto.
Then you should also be able to tell me where a young girl might stay in Noto; are there any hotels or rooming houses?
There's the Trinacria Hotel... or the Regina, near the municipal building. As for rooming houses, I don't know...
There's the Trinacria Hotel... or the Regina, near the municipal building. As for rooming houses, I don't know...
Thank you.
Thank you.
Don't mention it... Pleased to be of service any time.
Are you the owner of this place?
No. The owners are in Australia.
No. The owners are in Australia.
But where did you come from?
But where did you come from?
From Panarea. Why?
Whose boat is that?
What boat?
What boat?
Just a moment ago... didn't you hear the sound of a motor?

Early? Is four in the morning early for you?
Perhaps she wasn't feeling well... Maybe a cramp or something...
Anna is an excellent swimmer. Even with a cramp, she would have managed to reach shore somehow.
Anna is an excellent swimmer. Even with a cramp, she would have managed to reach shore somehow.
But you have to consider all possibilities, Sandro.
Listen, Patrizia... The Marshal says there's a current that passes by here and ends up at another island... I don't know which... He wants to send one of his men over to have a look... One never knows... Do you mind if I ask Raimondo to go with him?
I don't see why I should mind.
Patrizia, what are you going to do?
What do you want us to do? I don't know myself... But we'll do something.
What do you want us to do? I don't know myself... But we'll do something.
I'll go and get my valise.
We've decided to go to Montaldo's place. In fact, Ettore should already be there.
Good. Then I'll meet you there.
And here's Sandro. Why don't you two go upstairs and change?
Yes, we will.
Did you manage to find good rooms?
They didn't seem too good.
They didn't seem too good.
You should have told Ettore. He always manages to get what he wants.
You should have told Ettore. He always manages to get what he wants.
Ettore must be fed up with me by now.
Ettore must be fed up with me by now.
Oh, no, not at all. And then you know very well that he'll forgive you anything; just as long as you admit to him that you're a worse driver than he is...
Your mother?
Yes, even I had a mother. She was part Austrian, but she was still my mother. My childhood was like a tennis match; they bounced me back and forth, here and there...
Why have we stopped?
Lady Patrizia!
Raimondo... Do you enjoy fishing underwater?
I detest it. But, after all, what can you do... It's the latest...and I try my best to adapt myself.
Now, tell the truth, aren't you a bit disappointed?... But I already told you...
If women's breasts were colored, yours would be blue...
Patrizia, don't start in again... I would rather be called depraved. Unless you happen to love children.
You know, I don't love anybody.
You know, I don't love anybody.
I know, dammit, I know! And just think -- if there ever was a woman so right, so perfectly cut out for all kinds of dissipations, degradations, infidelities... of.. . of... of debaucheries, it's her. Well, anyway, she's faithful. Faithful out of laziness... of unwillingness.
You've made some mistake there with the bushes... that's why you can't finish it.
Take it easy, Raimondo. Why are you getting so impatient?
Here I am, Patrizia. I'm always here.
Claudia isn't coming with us. Will you please take care of her luggage? Thanks.
Zuria?
Yes. Until proven otherwise.
Yes. Until proven otherwise.
I would like to ask you something.
I would like to ask you something.
Wait a moment. Can't you see I'm busy?
She costs a hundred thousand lire.
You're kidding!
You're kidding!
No, I'm not. Why do you think she does all this? It's one of the many ways she can put herself on display. When you bait the trap, the mouse will snap. To tell you the truth, if it wasn't for the fact that one hundred thousand lire represents my whole month's salary, well... But you had something you wanted to ask me?
I read one of your articles regarding the disappearance of a girl. I'm that girl's fianc.
Oh... I'm sorry I have to rush but I've got to write a story about this thing that just happened... Tell me exactly how it all turned out.
Oh... I'm sorry I have to rush but I've got to write a story about this thing that just happened... Tell me exactly how it all turned out.
Now listen, if I had any information, I wouldn't have come here to ask you. But I see that you, too, lack any information ...
As a matter of fact, I've already had several phone calls on that article. One said they had seen the missing girl in an automobile somewhere in Rome. Another one said they saw her on the pier talking with some strange sailors... Could be she secretly left the island by boat...
Is that possible?
Is that possible?
Who knows?... Another one has it that she entered a store in Troina. This information comes from the storekeeper himself who stated that such and such a girl had bought I don't know what in his store... at Troina.

About fifty miles or so. If you want, I'll give you the name of the storekeeper.
About fifty miles or so. If you want, I'll give you the name of the storekeeper.
Yes... of course... But you should also print that in your paper... But right away, tomorrow morning... It's the local Palermo paper, isn't it?... I mean, it's widely read...
Yes... of course... But you should also print that in your paper... But right away, tomorrow morning... It's the local Palermo paper, isn't it?... I mean, it's widely read...
Yes, but why do you think our readers would be interested in such news now? Even if I sent it, the editors wouldn't print it.
Yes, but why do you think our readers would be interested in such news now? Even if I sent it, the editors wouldn't print it.

Yes, but goodness has very little to do with it. Not all the saints were good, in fact some of them were a little crazy. But... they were still attached to God. Agnes has that birth. No more... we're born, we live, we die. No room for miracles. Oh my dear, how I miss the miracles.
Do you think Agnes is still attached to God?

Well, it's nice to know you think we're clever.
And cunning.
And cunning.
And what do you do about it?
And what do you do about it?
Me? Oh, I don't have the time, I'm always running about with the lads ... no, we don't have the time.
Me? Oh, I don't have the time, I'm always running about with the lads ... no, we don't have the time.
Pity.
Pity.
Aye, it is but as long as you get by, it's all right, you know ... bash on, happy valley's when they let you stop. Anyroad, I'd better get back.

Of course.
Ah.
Quite right, invites to gambling dens full of easy money and fast women, chicken sandwiches and cornets of caviar, disgusting!
Will you ever look at him, sitting there wid his hooter scraping away at that book!
Well ... what's the matter with that?

A book!
A book!
Yeah ... a bloomin' book!
When you could be out there betraying a rich American widow or sipping palm wine in Tahiti before you're too old like me. A fine neat and trim lad the class of you should be helping himself to life's goodies before the sands run out. Being an old age pensioner's a terrible drag on a man and every second you waste is bringing you
Yeah ... funny really, 'cos I'd never thought of it but being middle-aged and old takes up most of your time, doesn't it?
Yeah ... funny really, 'cos I'd never thought of it but being middle-aged and old takes up most of your time, doesn't it?
You're only right.
You're only right.
I'm not wrong.
Where are you off to?
I'm going parading before it's too late!
Ringo, me old scout, they grabbed yer leg for the iron too, did they?
Well I'm not exactly a voluntary patient.
Well I'm not exactly a voluntary patient.
Shush! Have they roughed you up yet?
Shush! Have they roughed you up yet?

Keep your voice down, this lot'll paste you, just for the exercise. Oh they're a desperate crew of drippings and they've fists like matured hams for pounding defenceless lads like you.

Oh, they seem all right to me.

That's what they want you to think. All coppers are villains.

Lip reading.
Lip reading.
What are they saying?

Nothing good.
Well, you got me here so do your worst but I'll take one of you with me. Oh, I know your game, get me in the tiled room and out come the rubber hoses but I'll defy you still.
Is there a fire, then?
You ugly, great brute you, you have sadism stamped all over your bloated British kisser.
Eh?
Eh?
I'll go on a hunger strike. I know your caper. The kidney punch and the rabbit-clout. The third degree and the size twelve boot ankle-tap.

Get Lloyd George over there with that mechanic in the cloth cap while I sort this lot out.
Would you two like a cup of tea?
You see, sly villains.
Hello, Grandfather!
Hello.
Hello.
He can talk then?
And we're looking after him, are we?
I'll look after meself.
Come on let's get this coffee.
Before you go, I think it's only fair to warn you about me Grandson ... don't let our Paul have his own way all the time, 'cos if you do he won't respect you!
That's right; convict without trial ... Habeas corpus.
Every morning.
That'll keep you busy.
It's your nose, y'see. Fans are funny that way. Take a dislike to things. They'll pick on a nose...
Stay where you are everybody this is a raid and we want him.
Who are these ruffians?... I've never seen them before in my life! ...
You see. You know your trouble -- you should have gone West to America. You'd have wound up a Senior Citizen of Boston. As it is you took the wrong turning and what happened, you're a lonely old man from Liverpool.
But I'm clean.
Oh no, you're not. You've gone too far this time ... and who's paying for all this?
It's all taken care of. It's down on our bill.
It's all taken care of. It's down on our bill.
Oh, well that's all right. What?
And to think me own grandson would have let them put me behind bars!
Don't dramatise.
All right, how about Ringo? I mean ... he's very upset, you know ... and as far as your girlfriend, little Audrey's concerned, she's finished with men for the rest of her natural, and another thing ...
A harmless bit of fun, aah, none of you have any sense of humour left these days.
A harmless bit of fun, aah, none of you have any sense of humour left these days.
Oh, it's all right for you but those two girls were scared to death! Honest, Grandad, why? I mean, why do you do these things?
Oh, it's all right for you but those two girls were scared to death! Honest, Grandad, why? I mean, why do you do these things?
You're left-handed, aren't you, Paul?
You're left-handed, aren't you, Paul?
Yeah ... so what?
Yeah ... so what?
Why do you always use your left hand?
Why do you always use your left hand?
Well, don't be daft, I've got to.
Well, don't be daft, I've got to.
And I take a left-handed view of life, I've got to.
With a trombone hooter like yours it'd be unnatural if you didn't.
Don't mock the afflicted, Pauly.
Don't mock the afflicted, Pauly.
Oh for Pete's sake, It's only a joke.
Oh for Pete's sake, It's only a joke.
Well, it may be a joke, but it's his nose. He can't help having a horrible great nose, it's the only one he's got. And his poor little head's trembling under the weight of it.
Anything to spare?
We've just finished, Pauly. Hey George, write us your John Henry on this picture.
And another thing, where's that old mixer?
Here, Pauly.
No, that's his other one.
That's all right then.
That's all right then.
Clean though, isn't he?
Clean though, isn't he?
Oh yes, he's clean all right.
Is that yours?
For Ringo.
Aye, he looks a right lurker.
You're undressed. Where are your clothes?
Well, what are we waiting for?
Aye, come on, honest, that grandfather of yours is worse than any of you lot.
What are you doing there?
Hiding.
Hiding.
I think you're soft or something.
Eh ... pardon me for asking but who's that little old man?
What little old man?
What little old man?
That little old man.
That little old man.
Oh, that one. That's me Grandfather.
How d'you reckon that one out?
Well ... everyone's entitled to two, aren't they, and this is me other one.
Well ... everyone's entitled to two, aren't they, and this is me other one.
Well we know that but what's he doing here?
Well we know that but what's he doing here?
Well, me mother thought the trip 'ud do him good.
Aye and fond of fresh meat and all.
No ... it was his sweetbreads. She was dead kinky for sweetbreads. Anyroad, me mother thought it'ud give him a change of scenery, like.
No ... it was his sweetbreads. She was dead kinky for sweetbreads. Anyroad, me mother thought it'ud give him a change of scenery, like.
Oh, I see.
Eh, he's a nice old man, isn't he?
Oh yeah, he's very clean, y'know.
Aye, that's what I'm afraid of!
He's got you worried, then?
He's got you worried, then?
Him, he costs you a fortune in breach of promise cases. He's a villain and a right mixer as well.
Gie's a kiss!
Shurrup! Look, Mister, we've paid for our seats too, you know.
Give 'em a pull.
Shall I?
I hope he fell off.
Don't be callous.
We've broken out, oh, the blessed freedom of it all! Eh, have you got a nail file, these handcuffs are killing me. I was framed. I was innocent.
Will you stop it! Sorry to disturb you, miss...
Don't worry, son, we'll get you the best lawyer trading stamps can buy.
Oh, it's a laugh a line with Lennon. Anyroad up ... It's all your fault.
Gaw, it's depressing in here, isn't it? Funny... 'cos they usually reckon dogs more than people in England, don't they? You'd expect something a little more palatial. Come on. Let's have a little action. Let's do something, then.
Like what?
Like what?
Well, I've got me gob stopper. Look, a genuine Stradivarius, hand tooled at Dagenham.
Let's go and muck in.
Aye, before anyone stops us.
You won't interfere with the basic rugged concept of my personality, will you, girl?
Eh, don't take out me lines.
Behave...
Foreign devil ...
What's he know?
Nothing, he's trying to brainwash me and give me personality doubts ... oh, he's a swine but a clever swine, mind.
She's going to show me her stamp collection.
So's mine.
We've got only half an hour till the final run-through. He can't walk out on us.
Can't he? He's done it, son!
Well, I got a few things to say to you, two-faced John McCartney.
Aw, leave him alone Paul, he's back, isn't he? And it's not his fault he's old.
Aw, leave him alone Paul, he's back, isn't he? And it's not his fault he's old.
What's old got to do with it?
What's old got to do with it?
You needn't bother.
You needn't bother.
Y'what?
Y'what?
Practising to be thick-headed, you're there already.
Practising to be thick-headed, you're there already.
Look he's a mixer and a trouble maker!
Look he's a mixer and a trouble maker!
That's right, but he's only asking us to pay attention to him, aren't you?
Are you listening to me, Lennon?
You're a swine, isn't he George?
If you're going to have a barney I'll hold your coats.
He started it.
Eh, have you got Paul's grandfather?
Of course, he's concealed about me person.
Of course, he's concealed about me person.
No ... he's must have slipped off somewhere.
Don't move, any of you. They've gone potty out there. The whole place is surging with girls.
Please, can I have one to surge with?
Please, can I have one to surge with?
No.
No.
Ah, go on, you swine.
Ah, go on, you swine.
No, you can't. Look, as soon as I tell you, run through this door here and into the big car that's waiting.
Paul, John, George - get at it.
Hello the income tax have caught up with us at last.
Oh, it's got round that you're a heavy punter.
Well you're not going.
I'll brook no denial!
It's all right for you, you couldn't get a pen in your foot, you swine.
It's all right for you, you couldn't get a pen in your foot, you swine.
Come on, Shake, we'll leave 'em to their penmanship.
Now get on with it.
We were going to do it.
We were going to do it.
Aye, well, now!
Will you all stop it, you're like a gang of school kids. I knew this was going to happen one day.
Well, you shouldn't have had bacon for your breakfast, you cannibal.
Let's have you.
Come on speedy!
Don't cane me, sir, I was led astray.
Oh shurrup and come on John. They're waiting for you in the studio.
Leave him alone, he's got swine fever.
Sit down, the lot of you.
Leave him alone, Lennon, or I'll tell them all the truth about you.
You wouldn't!
You wouldn't!
I would though.
They're nearly ready for you. They're just finishing the band call.
Gear! Come on, girls, let's have a bit of a dance.
John, I'm talking to you. This final run through is <U>important</U>. Understand? Important.
Oink! Oink!
Hi Norm!
Hi, our lot!
Control yourself or you'll spurt. He's bound to be somewhere.
Aye, let's try the dressing room.
The office was on the phone, they think it'd be better if we pushed straight to Wolverhampton.
Tonight? We can't make it ...
Tonight? We can't make it ...
You've got a midnight matinee.
You've got a midnight matinee.
Now, look here, Norm ...
Now, look here, Norm ...
No, you look here, John. I've only one thing to say to you.
No, you look here, John. I've only one thing to say to you.
What?
What?
You're a swine. So hurry up ... we're travelling!
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Oh, wait a minute, don't tell me you're ...
Oh, wait a minute, don't tell me you're ...
No, not me.
No, not me.
Oh you are, I know you are.
Oh you are, I know you are.
No, I'm not.
No, I'm not.
You are.
You are.
I'm not, no.
I'm not, no.
Well, you look like him.
Well, you look like him.
Oh do I? You're the first one who ever said that.
Oh do I? You're the first one who ever said that.
Oh you do, look.
My eyes are lighter.
Oh yes.
Oh yes.
And my nose...
And my nose...
Well, yes your nose is. Very.
Well, yes your nose is. Very.
Is it?
Is it?
I would have said so.
I would have said so.
Aye, but you know him well.
Aye, but you know him well.
No I don't, he's only a casual acquaintance.
No I don't, he's only a casual acquaintance.
That's what you tell me.
That's what you tell me.
What have you heard?
What have you heard?
It's all over the place, everyone knows.
It's all over the place, everyone knows.
Is it? Is it really?
Is it? Is it really?
Mind you, I stood up for you, I mean I wouldn't have it.
Mind you, I stood up for you, I mean I wouldn't have it.
I knew I could rely on you.
I knew I could rely on you.
Thanks.
You're a window rattler, son.
Well, that's just your opinion. Do I snore, Paul?
It'll only get you into trouble.
Aah, shurrup, misery!
He's betrayed the class.
Oh, leave off!!!
Oh, leave off!!!
Temper! Temper!
Temper! Temper!
Well ...
That's right. It's always me, isn't it?
Since you ask, yes. Aah, come on, Ring, we love you.
Well!
He'll get over it.
Well, look after him. I don't want to find you've lost him.
Don't be cheeky, I'll bind him to me with promises. Come on, Grandad.
And?
Your Grandfather pointed out Shake was always being taller than me just to spite me.
Your Grandfather pointed out Shake was always being taller than me just to spite me.
I knew it, <U>he</U> started it, I should have known.
I knew it, <U>he</U> started it, I should have known.
Y'what?
Y'what?
You two have never had a quarrel in your life and in two minutes flat he's got you at it. He's a king mixer. Adam and Eve, meet the serpent. Anthony and Cleopatra, there's your asp. Divide and Conquer, that's this one's motto. He hates group unity so he gets everyone at it.
Have <U>you</U> lost him?
Don't exaggerate.
Don't exaggerate.
You've lost him.
Eh, where's my grandfather?
Don't worry about him. He can look after himself.
Don't worry about him. He can look after himself.
Aye, I suppose so.
I've got the stuff. Come here.
Aren't we ...
Aren't we ...
No, we're not!
Where's my grandfather?
Don't start. Look.
He belongs to Paul.
Ah well, there you go. Look, I'm going down the diner for a cup of coffee, are you coming?
None for me, then?
Sorry.
That's mine.
Have done, and you lot get your pens out.
Well ...
When I tell you to stay put, stay put.
Oh dear, I feel like doing a bit of work.
Good lad, Ringo.
Stop picking on him.
I don't need you to defend me, y'know, Norm.
What do you think are you're up to?
Someone put it on me.
Look after him.
But...
But...
Do I have to raise me voice?
Do I have to raise me voice?
Oh, all right. Come here, Grandad.
Yeah, you want to watch it.
It's not my fault.
It's not my fault.
Well, you stick to that story, son.
Well, you stick to that story, son.
I can't help it, I'm just taller than you.
I'm sorry Norm, but I can't help being taller than you.
Well, you don't have to rub me nose in it. I've a good mind to ...
He's been gone a long time.
Who?
Who?
Paul's grandfather.
Paul's grandfather.
Oh, I didn't notice, where'd he go?
Oh, I didn't notice, where'd he go?
Down the ... er ...
Down the ... er ...
Oh, down the ... er ...?
Oh, down the ... er ...?
Yeah, down the ... er ...
Yeah, down the ... er ...
Well, give a couple of minutes ...
Oh they've probably gone to the canteen, cup of tea, like.
That's too easy for Lennon.
He's out there somewhere, causing trouble just to upset me.
You're imagining it. You're letting things prey on your mind.
You're imagining it. You're letting things prey on your mind.
Oh no... this is a battle of nerves between John and me.
Oh no... this is a battle of nerves between John and me.
But John hasn't got any.
But John hasn't got any.
What?
What?
Nerves.
Nerves.
I know, that's the trouble.
I'm adjusting the decibels on the inbalance.
Clever. George.
... as they head up for the show. Oh yes, well I mean it'ud be a pity to miss the show, wouldn't it like.
Shurrup, cheerful.
How's that?
Oh ... he's nursing a broken heart.
Course he can talk. He's a human being, like. Isn't he?
Well ... if he's your Grandfather, who knows?
"The Management of Boyd's takes pleasure in requesting the company of Mr. Richard Starkey, that's you, in their recently refinished gaming rooms. Chemin de Fer. Baccarat, Roulette, and Champagne Buffet." Blimey!
And they want me?
Oh, he's gone to my club, has he?
Yeah, It's all your fault, getting invites to gambling clubs. He's probably in the middle of an orgy by now.
What's the matter with you? You were bashing away like a madman.
You were twanging too loud.
Eh. I thought you were looking after the old man.
Get knotted!
Put it this way, he's mislaid him.
You can't trust you with anything, Norm, if you've lost him, I'll cripple you.
You can't trust you with anything, Norm, if you've lost him, I'll cripple you.
He can't be far.
Eh, what's all this?
Oh, him... He's been lurking.
Shove the gentleman jockey in the make-up room or something and keep your eye on him, will you?
I'm an electrician, not a wet nurse, y'know.
I'm an electrician, not a wet nurse, y'know.
I'll set John on you!
I'll set John on you!
Oh, anything you say, Paul.
What is he?
I've got a little list here. Wandering abroad. Malicious intent. Acting in a suspicious manner. Conduct liable to cause a breach of the peace. You name it, he's done it.
I've got a little list here. Wandering abroad. Malicious intent. Acting in a suspicious manner. Conduct liable to cause a breach of the peace. You name it, he's done it.
Oh, a little savage, is he?
Oh, a little savage, is he?
A proper Aborigine.
So you just brought the old chap out of the crowd for his own good.
Yeah, but he insisted on us bringing him to the station.
Yeah, but he insisted on us bringing him to the station.
Well, he can't stop here.
Oh... God... am I cold...
Is that you, Roby?
Is that you, Roby?
I feel like shit...
I feel like shit...
Yeah, it's you all right.
I'm going to buy a cattle ranch.
Cattle ranch!
Cattle ranch!
I'm not kidding. You can get one if you have the credit. Look just like real cows, too.
If there is some kind of alien intelligence down on that planetoid, it'd be a serious mistake for us to blunder in unequipped.
Hell, we're equipped --
Hell, we're equipped --
Hell, no! We don't know what's down there on that piece of rock! It might be dangerous! What we should do is get on the radio to the exploration authorities... and let them deal with it.
Locked.
Kill drive engines.
Engines off.
Nine hundred meters and dropping. 800. 700. Hang on gentlemen.
Good! Maybe we'll be able to see something then.
Or something will be able to see us.
There could be a whole city out there and we'd never see it.
Not sitting on our butts in here, that's for sure.
Are you in pain?
Not exactly, just feel like somebody's been beating me with rubber hoses for about six years.
Dell, what's the last thing you can remember?
... I don't know...
... I don't know...
Do you remember the pyramid?
Do you remember the pyramid?
No. Just some horrible dreams about smothering. Where are we?
Where's Irth?
Sandy, scan the whole sky.
I don't recognize that constellation.
Dell, plot our location.
I got it. Oh boy.
Where the hell are we?
Where the hell are we?
Just short of Zeta II Reticuli. We haven't even reached the outer rim yet.
Can you get it a little closer?
That's what I'm going to do.
Any rotation?
Yeah. Two hours.
Yeah. Two hours.
Gravity?
Gravity?
Point eight six. We can walk on it.
Except it will take 75 years to get a reply back. Don't forget how far we are from the Colonies, Martin.
There are no commercial lanes out here. Face it, we're out of range.
Dell, I want greater magnification. More surface detail. I want to see what this place looks like.
I'll see what I can do.
Activate lifter quads.
Activated. Vertical drop checked. Correcting course. On tangential course now, orbiting. Crossing the terminator. Entering night side.
Approaching point of origin. Closing at 20 kilometers, 15 and slowing. Ten. Five. Gentlemen, we are directly above the source of the transmission.
What's the terrain down there?
What's the terrain down there?
Well, line of sight is impossible due to dust. Radar gives me noise. Sonar gives me noise. Infrared -- noise. Let's try ultraviolet. There. Flat. It's totally flat. A plain.
Well, line of sight is impossible due to dust. Radar gives me noise. Sonar gives me noise. Infrared -- noise. Let's try ultraviolet. There. Flat. It's totally flat. A plain.
Is it solid?
Is it solid?
It's... basalt. Rock.
It's... basalt. Rock.
Then take her down.
Then take her down.
Drop begins... now! Fifteen kilometers and dropping... twelve... ten... eight and slowing. Five. Three. Two. One kilometer and slowing. Lock tractor beams.
Close enough to walk to!
Martin, would you run me an atmospheric?
I'm sending. Do you hear me?
Receiving.
Appears to be a door hanging open, the entrance is clogged with debris.
Looks like a derelict.
Looks like a derelict.
Martin, we're going in. I'm going to hold the conversation to a minimum from here on.
I'll go first.
No, you'll follow me.
Just machinery.
But functioning.
This is Chaz.
Chaz, this is Dell. Can you come topside for a minute?
Chaz, this is Dell. Can you come topside for a minute?
What's up?
What's up?
Well, the sun just came up again, and it seems the wind's died down. It's as clear as a bell outside. There's something I think you ought to see.

I'm on my way.
What is it?
Take a look.
I was scanning the horizon to see what I could pick up. Look there, on that screen.
What is it, I can't --
Maybe we can get in by the top.
You want to try?
You want to try?
Sure.
Can we come up?
No, it's too small, only room enough for one person.
No, it's too small, only room enough for one person.
Can you see anything in the hole?
Dell, you want to come down, we can figure out where to go from here.
No, I want to go in.
Okay, I'm in the mouth of the chimney now, and I'm starting down.
Take care.
Are you okay in there?
Yeah, I'm okay. Haven't hit bottom yet. Definitely a column of warm air rising; it keeps the shaft clear of dust.
Yeah, I'm okay. Haven't hit bottom yet. Definitely a column of warm air rising; it keeps the shaft clear of dust.
What was that Dell, I lost you, do you read me?
What was that Dell, I lost you, do you read me?
Yeah, but this is hard work. Can't talk now.
How do you feel, Dell?
Wretched. What happened to me?
Wretched. What happened to me?
Don't you remember?
Don't you remember?
Don't remember nothing. Can't hardly remember my name.
Hell, you're in great shape, you've got your sense of humor back!
God I'm hungry.
I'm really starving; can we get some food before we go into the freezers?
I think that's a pretty reasonable request.
What's wrong?
I don't know... I'm getting these <u>CRAMPS</u>!
Breathe deeply.
<u>OH GOD IT HURTS SO BAD</u>!
Computer, this is Captain Standard. What conditions are you talking about?
I have intercepted a transmission of unknown origin.
I have intercepted a transmission of unknown origin.
A transmission?
A transmission?
A voice transmission.
I have recorded the transmission.
Play it for us, please.
Computer, what language was that?
Unknown.
Just <u>hold it</u>, <u>hold it</u>! Computer: have you attempted to analyze the transmission?
Yes. There are two points of salient interest. Number one: it is highly systematized, indicating intelligent origin. Number two: certain sounds are inconsistent with the human palate.
I have interrupted the course of the voyage.
What? <u>Why</u>?
What? <u>Why</u>?
I am programmed to do so if certain conditions arise.
Unknown! What do you mean?
It is none of the 678 dialects spoken by technological man.
Yes!
I have a temporary sequence on the monitor --
I have a temporary sequence on the monitor --
Hold it, I can't hear a damn thing!
Computer! I've turned all the cooling units back on! What's wrong?
The reaction has proceeded too far. The core has begun to melt. Engines will overload in 2 minutes, 35 seconds.
Just a minute, hold it, I'm checking.
Has the hull been breached?
How long to fix?
Hard to say.
Hard to say.
Well, get started.
Well, get started.
Right. Talk to you.
Hello, Faust!
Yeah!
Yeah!
How's it coming on the engines?
<u>He</u> died.
What?
What?
Not <u>they</u>... <u>he</u>...
Sorry to interrupt, but I'm gonna charge up the engines for a minute, okay?
Yeah, okay. Go ahead.
Yes? What is it?
Jay, we've got a problem. I was wondering if there was any way you could shortcut the repairs and give us immediate takeoff capability.
Jay, we've got a problem. I was wondering if there was any way you could shortcut the repairs and give us immediate takeoff capability.
Why, what's wrong?
Why, what's wrong?
The computer's translated the alien signal, and it's kind of alarming.
The computer's translated the alien signal, and it's kind of alarming.
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
It couldn't translate the whole thing, only three phrases. I'll just read it to you the way I got it: "... HOSTILE... SURVIVAL... ADVISE DO NOT LAND... " And that's all it could translate.
You like this shit?
It grows on you.
It grows on you.
You know what they make this stuff out of?
You know what they make this stuff out of?
Yes, I know what they make it out of, so what? It's food now. <u>You're</u> eating it.
Yes, I know what they make it out of, so what? It's food now. <u>You're</u> eating it.
I didn't say it was bad for you, it's just kind of sickening, that's all.
But we can't kill it. If we kill it, it will spill all its body acids right through our hull and out into space.
Shit...
We could cut a section out of that metallite netting. It won't hold up to that acid, but aside from that it's pretty strong.
We have to avoid injuring it. What we really need is some electric animal prods.
Where's it coming from?
Machine's screwed up, I can't tell. Needle's spinning all over the dial.
Okay.
That way.
What happened to the lights?
Bulbs burned out, nobody bothered to replace 'em.
Where does that go?
All over the ship; we'll have to check the charts to know for sure.
What happened? Where's Sandy?
Dead.
Dead.
Dead!
Dead!
It's monstrous -- it grew, like some horrible tapeworm. We were completely unprepared.
It's monstrous -- it grew, like some horrible tapeworm. We were completely unprepared.
It's still in the ship?
What the hell's going on?
Don't know -- Broussard got hurt somehow.
Don't know -- Broussard got hurt somehow.
Hurt! How?
Hurt! How?
Don't know -- maybe we'll be real lucky and he just broke his neck. I knew we shouldn't of come down here.
Oh -- God -- oh --
Is it alive?
Boy do I feel a lot better. It's a straight shot back to the Colonies, and then we can start taking bids on the paydirt. Any bets on the top bid?
Well, we should at least be able to each buy our own planet.
Oh, no. Oh, no.
What was that? What the Christ was that?
And then we run out of food and oxygen.
The water will still recycle.
That one section of the ventilator shaft has only two outlets -- you notice? The food storage room on one end --
-- And the cooling unit on the other.
Well, uh... good luck. I hope you won't need me, but if you do, I'm here.
Right.
Martin, this is Jay. The intakes are clogged with dust. We overheated and burned out a whole cell.
Damn it! How long to fix?
Jay... how's it coming on the repairs?
Well... I'm going to have to blow the engines out...
Well... I'm going to have to blow the engines out...
And when will you be ready to do that?
And when will you be ready to do that?
Oh -- I'm not near ready yet.
Oh -- I'm not near ready yet.
Then why the hell are you sitting around here?
Then why the hell are you sitting around here?
Right.
It's really on there tight.
Here, let me try.
Hey, guess what?
What?
What?
The engines are fixed.
This dust is getting clogged in the intakes again!
Just hold us together till we're in space, that's all!
Oh it's okay. I've had better cag than this, but I've had worse too, if you know what I mean.
I kind of like it.
So does anybody have any suggestions?
We could put on our pressure suits and blow all the air out of the ship. That would kill it.
We could put on our pressure suits and blow all the air out of the ship. That would kill it.
No, we can't afford to lose that much oxygen. We're going to have to flush it out.
Might even incinerate the damn thing.
I hope not.
It's clear.
All right -- Roby and Melkonis will go with Faust. Hunter and I will make up the second team.
It looks completely different from the first one -- it's more like a worm with legs... and tentacles.
Well we better do something.
So it's trapped in between -- now we have to drive it out.
Poison gas...
Hey, are you guys still there? What's going on?
Meet us on the bridge. Be careful -- it's <u>huge</u> now.
Meet us on the bridge. Be careful -- it's <u>huge</u> now.
Right.
There's some more combustible fuel down in the storage lockers next to the lounge. I'll go get it.
No, I don't want us separated.
No, I don't want us separated.
You just sealed it off; it can't get to that section.
All right... but do <u>not</u> go below decks.
Right.
Right.
And be right back.
He wouldn't open the lock; he was going to leave us out there.
Yeah... well, maybe he should have. I mean, you brought the goddamn thing in here. Maybe <u>you</u> deserve to get slapped.
Where did it come from?
<u>He's</u> the only one that knows that.
<u>He's</u> the only one that knows that.
How does he breathe?
Blood's thoroughly oxygenated.
Yeah, but how? His nose and mouth are blocked.
We can't expect to understand a life form like this. We're out of our back yard. Things are different here.
Well, can't we kill it? I mean, we can't leave the damn thing on him.
Well, can't we kill it? I mean, we can't leave the damn thing on him.
We don't know what might happen if we tried to kill it. At least right now it's keeping him alive.
We don't know what might happen if we tried to kill it. At least right now it's keeping him alive.
How about cutting it off? We can't pull it loose, but we can cut off everything but the bottom layer, where it's stuck to his face.
God, that smoke's poisonous!
It's eating a hole in the floor!
I never saw anything like that in my life... except molecular acid.
But this thing uses it for <u>blood</u>.
But this thing uses it for <u>blood</u>.
Hell of a defense mechanism. You don't dare kill it.
It makes me sick to see him like that.
Isn't there some way we can get it off him?
It's a crude symbolic language -- looks primitive.
You can't tell -- that kind of stuff could represent printed circuits...
We can't go into hypersleep with that thing running around loose.
We'd be sitting ducks in the freezers.
It's over, Hunter.
Boy, that's terrific.
Boy, that's terrific.
Well, how does it feel to be rich men?
That thing, God almighty, didn't you try to get it off him?
It wouldn't come.
Hey now, what is this?
Ask him.
There. Should be coming through about there.
Careful, don't get under it!
I'll do it. The rest of you continue.
I'll come with you.
You know, it's fantastic -- the human race has gone this long without ever encountering another advanced life form, and now we run into a veritable zoo.
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
Well, those things out there aren't the same, you know -- the spaceship and the pyramid. They're from different cultures and different races. That ship just landed here -- crashed like we did. The pyramid and the thing from it are indigenous.
Well, those things out there aren't the same, you know -- the spaceship and the pyramid. They're from different cultures and different races. That ship just landed here -- crashed like we did. The pyramid and the thing from it are indigenous.
How could anything be indigenous to this asteroid? It's dead.
How could anything be indigenous to this asteroid? It's dead.
Maybe it wasn't always dead.
Now we're in for it.
The door was closed. It must still be in here.
No, don't open the door. We don't want it escaping.
Well, what the hell good can we do in here? We can't grab it -- it might jump on us --
Well, what the hell good can we do in here? We can't grab it -- it might jump on us --
Maybe we can catch it.
Yes?
How's Broussard?
How's Broussard?
He's running a fever.
He's running a fever.
Still unconscious?
Still unconscious?
Yes.
Yes.
Can you do anything for him?
Can you do anything for him?
The machine will bring his temperature down. His vital functions are strong.
The machine will bring his temperature down. His vital functions are strong.
Good.
I think I could cobble something together. A long metal rod with a battery in it. Give it a hell of a shock.
Good. Get on it. But first, I'm issuing a standing order: from this moment forth, every one of us will wear protective garments, including helmets. Let's get down to the locker and change.
Don't worry, it won't damage it, it'll just give it a little incentive.
How do we locate the creature?
Maybe we don't have to. It's trapped in there. We could just leave it in there all the way back to Irth.
Don't be an idiot.
We can't pump poison gas down into the cooling unit! It'll flood the whole ship!
The only other thing I can think of is for somebody to crawl in there and flush it out.
While the rest of us wait down in the cooling unit with the net.
Sounds like a rough one.
Sounds like a rough one.
Got a better idea?
We'd better seal off the lower maintenance level; at least trap it there.
At least it can't get up here now.
Listen, it sure didn't like this flamethrower.
That's right -- we can't kill it on the ship, but we can at least keep it at bay -- and maybe drive it into the air lock.
That's right -- we can't kill it on the ship, but we can at least keep it at bay -- and maybe drive it into the air lock.
Thing is, I'm about out of fuel.
We've got six hours left.
Oh my God.
Oh my God.
Does anybody know what happened?
Oh no! We can't fight this thing! There's only six hours of air left -- we're dead men!
I don't buy that. There's still time to destroy it and get ourselves in the freezers.
I don't buy that. There's still time to destroy it and get ourselves in the freezers.
<u>How</u>?
<u>How</u>?
It's time for drastic remedies.
If we could just get the <u>creature</u> into the lifeboat, we could launch it into space and blow it up.
Good! That's good!
Good! That's good!
We can load the lifeboat up with explosives and trigger them remotely, once the lifeboat is in space.
You can't say that; I think it's a good plan.
The flamethrower needs more fuel.
The flamethrower needs more fuel.
Right. We've got a lot to accomplish. Let's get moving.
The ship's gravitational attraction must have drawn him back.
Should we go outside and bring him in?
Should we go outside and bring him in?
No... the risk is too great. Perhaps after we've destroyed the thing.
It will be.
What we really need is some red meat in here for bait.
Well... now we have to herd that thing up here.
Whoever's doing the herding is gonna have their hands pretty full. I think somebody should stay by the lifeboat to slam the door on the thing once it's inside, and to serve as... as...
It must have stopped moving. I'm not getting anything.
Let me go first; you stay behind me.
The flamethrower!
I can't, the acid will pour out!
Now what's wrong?
I've completely lost their signal.
I've completely lost their signal.
Can you get them back?
Can you get them back?
I'm trying.
What? What was that?
The computer just translated the goddamn message. It's not an S.O.S. It was a warning.
I'm getting nowhere. The whole area around the pyramid is dead to transmission. I think we should go after them.
No.
No.
What do you mean, no?
What do you mean, no?
We're not going anywhere.
We're not going anywhere.
But they don't know about the translation! They could be in danger right now.
But they don't know about the translation! They could be in danger right now.
We can't spare the personnel. We've got minimum takeoff capability right now. That's why Chaz left us on board.
We can't spare the personnel. We've got minimum takeoff capability right now. That's why Chaz left us on board.
Why, you chickenshit bastard --
Why, you chickenshit bastard --
Just can that crap! I'm in command here till Chaz returns! And nobody's leaving this ship!
I've got 'em! They're back on my screens!
How many?
How many?
Three blips! They're coming this way!
Oh no.
Jay, this is Cleave! Meet me at the main air lock!
I keep my mouth pretty much shut, but I don't like hitting.
I guess I had it coming. Let's call it settled.
Look at that.
What is it -- I can't tell anything --
What is it -- I can't tell anything --
It's some kind of organ -- it's inserted some kind of tube or something down his throat.
It's some kind of organ -- it's inserted some kind of tube or something down his throat.
Oh... God...
I think that's how it's getting oxygen to him.
It doesn't make any sense. It paralyzes him... puts him into a coma... then keeps him alive.
What's happening up here?
I think it's fizzled out.
This is horrible.
Hey! what about the film?
That must have been when he got it.
The same thing must've happened to the creatures on the other ship... except they took one of those jars on board, and opened it there.
What common objects?
Listen, hadn't somebody better check on Broussard?
You mean his body was still kicking when it ran off with him?
It was horrible -- horrible. Like a chicken.
Don't count on it.
We sure need this flamethrower.
Recognizable! In that?
In symbolic form... very stylized... but if you stare at it, you can see some of the different creatures we've been dealing with.
In symbolic form... very stylized... but if you stare at it, you can see some of the different creatures we've been dealing with.
Well... I suppose that star-shaped thing could be the parasite that got on Broussard. Is that what you mean?
Well... I suppose that star-shaped thing could be the parasite that got on Broussard. Is that what you mean?
And right next to it, that oval design with the markings -- it's a dead ringer for the spore casings.
... And Broussard got caught in their reproductive cycle.
You will notice, though, that there are no more phases. Only four forms are shown. After that the pattern repeats.
We can't kill it on board. It's huge now and must have tremendous amounts of that acid in its body.
I've got an idea, but you're not going to like it.
Blow the ship up?
And the creature with it. We can make it back to Irth in the lifeboat.
What about all the minerals and elements in the cargo hold? That's the only reason we came out here. We'd have to abandon them all. We'd be broke.
Our lives are more important. Anyway, we can take a small amount of the most valuable stuff with us on the lifeboat.
I think it's going to be almost impossible to drive it up into the lifeboat.
We can use the flamethrower.
We can use the flamethrower.
It's not going to work.
This should do it.
I should hope so! And we'd better make sure it's pretty far from the ship when we blow it.
Isn't "bait" the word you used?
Hey look, somebody has to have his hands free to lock the creature in the lifeboat!
Just keep your finger off the button till she's way away from the ship, that's all.
Is it armed?
Is it armed?
If you press the button right now, it will blow the whole nose of the ship off.
If you press the button right now, it will blow the whole nose of the ship off.
Thanks for the thought.
Sandy, you want to give us some vision?
Feast your eyes.
First contact...
Sandy, can you home in on that beam?
Sandy, can you home in on that beam?
What's the frequency?
What's the frequency?
Computer, what's the frequency of the transmission?
I've got it. It's coming from ascension 6 minutes 32 seconds, declination -39 degrees 2 seconds.
Dell -- show me that on a screen.
Well, we can't go anywhere in this darkness. How long till dawn?
Well... this rock rotates every two hours. The sun should be coming up in about 20 minutes.
Just settle down. Sandy, you get any response yet?
Sorry. Nothing but that same damn transmission, every 32 seconds. I've tried every frequency on the spectrum.
Receiving.
All right. Now just remember: keep away from those weapons unless I say otherwise. Martin, do you read me?
That way.
You lead.
What's wrong?
My signal's fading.
It's close, real close.
How far?
How far?
We should be almost on top of it. I just can't quite...
Air lock?
Who knows?
Doesn't seem much doubt about it, does there?
That creature sure must have considered it important... using his last strength to draw it...
This looks ancient.
Can't tell -- these weather conditions could erode anything, fast.
What'd he say?
I couldn't make it out -- too much interference.
If we don't hear from him soon, I think we better go in after him.
Sun will be down in a minute.
Here's his line. We can haul him out of there if we have to.
It'll yank him right off his feet if he's not expecting it. The line could get tangled in something.
It'll yank him right off his feet if he's not expecting it. The line could get tangled in something.
But what can we do? He's out of radio contact.
But what can we do? He's out of radio contact.
Maybe we should just wait a few more minutes.
There, it caught!
Is it still coming up, or is it hooked on something?
Is it still coming up, or is it hooked on something?
No, it's coming.
No, it's coming.
Can you see anything?
<u>What is it</u>?
<u>Don't touch him, watch it</u>!
Oh God, oh God no.
Help me -- I'm going to try to get it off.
It won't come -- it's stuck.
What is it?
What is it?
How the hell should I know? Come on, give me a hand, let's get him out of there!
It's not coming off -- not without his whole face coming off too.
Let's let the machine work on him.
It's stopped?
Yes, thank heaven.
Yes, thank heaven.
We're just plain lucky. That could have gone right through the hull -- taken <u>weeks</u> to patch it.
We're just plain lucky. That could have gone right through the hull -- taken <u>weeks</u> to patch it.
Reminded me of when I was a kid and the roof leaked -- everybody running for the pots and pans.
No, thank God... just missed him.
Is it still dripping?
Is it still dripping?
It appears to have healed itself.
That sounds a little fanciful...
Primitive pictorial languages are based on common objects in the environment, and this can be used as a starting point for translation...
Too primitive. It's a pre- technological construction. That slab was engineered by an Iron-Age culture at best.
They're from a dead civilization; they're spores from a tomb. God knows how long they've been here.
We're going home. We're in hyperspace.
We're going into the freezers now.
I'm going to write a book about this expedition. I'm going to call it "The Snark Log."
The commander normally has first publication rights.
The commander normally has first publication rights.
Maybe we could write it together.
We'll have to catch it and eject it from the ship.
Well, I kind of hate to point it out, but all our supplies are based on us spending a strictly limited amount of time out of suspended animation... and as you know, we used up most of that time in harvesting.

We've got about a week left, right?
How?
Room by room, corridor by corridor.
And what do we do when we find it?
We'll have to trap it somehow. If we had a really strong piece of net, we could bag it.
I thought I'd find you here.
I was thinking of a line from an old poem: "Water, water everywhere, but not a drop to drink." All that space out there, and we're trapped in this ship.

We can't even radio for help; the carrier wave wouldn't reach its destination till long after we'd died and turned to dust. We are utterly, absolutely alone. Can anybody really visualize such a scale of distances? Halfway across Creation...

I can see you're putting your spare time to good use. Let me tell you something: you keep staring at hyperspace for long enough, they'll be peeling you off a wall. I've seen it happen.

We're the new pioneers, Chaz. We even have our own special diseases.
Come on -- let's go above and see how they're coming with the gear.
I've got Hunter... and something else as well, in front of him.
Are they close?
Are they close?
They're on the next level up.
They're on the next level up.
Let's get moving with this net.
They're getting pretty close now.
All right, then -- when it gets to the other side of the door, you sing out, then drop the door. Okay?
All right, then -- when it gets to the other side of the door, you sing out, then drop the door. Okay?
Okay.
Okay.
And you and I will bag it, and then we'll take it to the ventral air lock, got it?
Men have waited centuries to contact another form of intelligent life in the universe. This is an opportunity which may never come again.
Look --
My God, it's stormy for a piece of rock that size!
Just a second. Those aren't water vapor clouds; they have no moisture content.
Source of transmission is to the northeast... about 300 meters.
Close...
It appears to be a heavy fluid of some sort... it blocks the X-rays...
That tube must be depositing it in him.
That tube must be depositing it in him.
Could be some kind of venom, or poison...
These day and night cycles are totally disorienting. I feel like we've been here for days, but it's only been how long?
About four hours.
We do know that.
Yeah?
Yeah?
They never made it off the planet. The parasites won.
No. It's just too small to support fauna as big as the parasites. If there were a native ecology, it would have to be microscopic.
Couldn't the pyramid have been built here by space travellers?
First thing I'm going to do when we get back is eat some biological food.
What's the matter, you don't like this stuff?
What's the matter, you don't like this stuff?
Tastes like something you'd feed a chicken to make it lay more eggs.
All right, tycoons, let's stop spending our credit and start worrying about the job at hand.
Right. Fire up all systems.
Where are we?
Sandy, contact traffic control.
This is Chaz speaking. Sorry, but we are not home. Our present location seems to be only halfway to Irth. Remain at your posts and stand by. That is all.
Chaz, I've got something here on my security alert. A high priority from the computer...
Chaz, I've got something here on my security alert. A high priority from the computer...
Let's hear it.
Let's hear it.
Computer, you have signalled a priority three message. What is the message?
Oh my God.
Well, it's finally happened.
It's out of focus.
No -- that's atmosphere. Cloud layer.
Atmospheric turbulence. Dust storm.
Turn on navigation lights.
What the hell happened?
Engine room, what happened?
Yeah, okay.
Sandy... how far are we from the source of the transmission?
10% argon, 85% nitrogen, 5% neon... and some trace elements.
Nontoxic... but unbreathable. Pressure?
Nontoxic... but unbreathable. Pressure?
Ten to the fourth dynes per square centimeter.
Ten to the fourth dynes per square centimeter.

Any microorganisms?
Any microorganisms?
Not a one. It's dead.
Not a one. It's dead.
Anything else?
Anything else?
Yeah, rock particles. Dust.
Yeah, rock particles. Dust.
Well, we won't need pressure suits, but breathing masks are called for. Sandy -- can you rig up some kind of portable unit that we can use to follow that transmission to its source?
Okay, Chaz, I hear you. I've got you on my board.
Good. I'm getting you clear too. Let's just keep the line open.
Martin, uh, we've found it.
Found what?
Found what?
It appears to be some sort of spacecraft. We're going to approach it.
Martin?
I agree. This is the single most important discovery in history.
I agree. This is the single most important discovery in history.
But?
But?
What killed it?
Find anything we missed?
I don't even know what I'm looking for.
I don't even know what I'm looking for.
Still worried?
Still worried?
Oh well... you know me.
Oh well... you know me.
I've always respected your opinion, Martin. If something worries you, it worries me.
What would you say that was supposed to mean?
Well... it's obviously intentional... some kind of attempt at communication... maybe it's a symbol that means something to them...
Well... it's obviously intentional... some kind of attempt at communication... maybe it's a symbol that means something to them...
But why draw it on the wall?
This ship is full of cat hair.
Tell you what, Martin. As soon as the engine's fixed --
Hey, can you guys hear me?
Yeah, we hear you! We're coming back!
Yeah, we hear you! We're coming back!
Thank Christ! We lost you! Listen, there's been a new development --
Thank Christ! We lost you! Listen, there's been a new development --
Can't talk now; Broussard's injured. We'll need some help getting him into the ship.
Here, Chaz.
We're coming up now, open the outer lock door.
We're coming up now, open the outer lock door.
Chaz -- what happened to Broussard?
Chaz -- what happened to Broussard?
It's some kind of organism, it's attached itself to him. Let us in.
You hear me, Martin? Open the outer door.
Chaz, if it's an organism, and we let it in, the ship will be infected.
Chaz, if it's an organism, and we let it in, the ship will be infected.
We can't leave him out here, open the door.
We can't leave him out here, open the door.
Chaz, listen to me -- we've broken every rule of quarantine. If we bring an organism on board, we won't have a single layer of defense left.
Chaz, listen to me -- we've broken every rule of quarantine. If we bring an organism on board, we won't have a single layer of defense left.
Martin, this is an order! Open the door!
I understand why you did that.
Good.
Would somebody fill me in?
He went into the pyramid alone. We lost radio contact with him. When we pulled him out, it was on his face. It won't come off, not without injuring him.
What film?
Broussard had film in his datastick, didn't he? We can see what happened to him.
Look at these suckers -- no wonder we couldn't get it off him.
Is that its mouth?
I'm sorry to say it looks like you were right in the first place, Martin. We never should have landed here.
Look, I'm not trying to rub anybody's nose in anything. The important thing is just to get away from here as fast as possible.
Look, I'm not trying to rub anybody's nose in anything. The important thing is just to get away from here as fast as possible.
I can't lean on Faust any harder -- he's been working non-stop on the engines.
I can't lean on Faust any harder -- he's been working non-stop on the engines.
If we knew exactly what happened to the beings on the other ship --
Where did the parasites come from?
They seem native to the planet. It's got an atmosphere and a dense gravity. It's dead now, but once it must have been fertile.
Take us up.
Up one kilometer, Jay.
Engaged.
Let's take her into an escape orbit.
We made it! Damn, we made it!
You bet we made it. Martin, set course for Irth and accelerate us into stardrive.
You bet we made it. Martin, set course for Irth and accelerate us into stardrive.
With great pleasure.
That's the part that always makes me feel like I'm gonna puke -- when we accelerate into light speed.
Quit complaining; we're in space.
I think the best thing to do with Broussard is to just freeze him as he is. It'll arrest the progress of his disease, and he can get complete medical attention when we get back to the Colonies.
We'll have to go into quarantine, maybe for quite a while.
We'll have to go into quarantine, maybe for quite a while.
That's okay, he can remain in hypersleep until they're ready to treat him.
We won't need it then.
All right, so that's what we've got. A week. It's plenty of time.
All right, so that's what we've got. A week. It's plenty of time.
But if we <u>haven't</u> caught it in a week, then we have to go into the freezers anyway.
These will be very useful. At least we won't have to go digging around in closets with our bare hands. All right, here's the battle plan: we're going to break into two teams and start systematically covering the ship. Whoever finds it first, catches it in the net and ejects it from the nearest airlock. Clear?
Even simple.
Yes!
We've got it up here! It's trapped! Get up here fast!
We've got it up here! It's trapped! Get up here fast!
Where are you?
Where are you?
Food-storage room!
Food-storage room!
We're coming!
What's it doing, having a seizure?
It started crashing around right after we locked it in.
It started crashing around right after we locked it in.
Now what?
Now what?
I guess we open the door and net it.
Hey, wait a minute! That's all our food supplies in there! We can't pump poison gas all over them!
Once we kill the thing we won't need the food any more -- we can go straight into hypersleep. Also, it sounds like that thing is already doing a pretty good job on our supplies; it may be fouling them all.
Once we kill the thing we won't need the food any more -- we can go straight into hypersleep. Also, it sounds like that thing is already doing a pretty good job on our supplies; it may be fouling them all.
You win.
This stuff's deadly -- I hope we know what we're doing.
Go ahead, Jay.
Now what?
What do you think? Now we go in.
Are you <u>crazy</u>?
The man would need protection, obviously -- as well as some way to drive the thing before him.
So the only question left is: who gets to crawl down the airshaft?
Let's be democratic.
That's a flip-flop gate to channel the air, but we can use it to trap the thing.
Right now let's keep it closed.
How did it get so <u>big</u>?
By eating our food supplies.
Two down, four to go.
What's that supposed to mean?
What's that supposed to mean?
Nothing.
Can you make out any pattern in all that?
Well... yes... there's a pattern... but it's meaningless to me.
Well... yes... there's a pattern... but it's meaningless to me.
I know it looks like a senseless jumble, but if you look closely, there are recognizable forms.
That next thing there -- six legs, tentacles -- that's the thing we saw in the food locker.
So the next step should be --
This is all the same creature. We're seeing the different stages in its life-cycle.
Then that tomb... must have been some kind of fertility temple... where they stored their eggs, and maybe held mating rituals...
Which presumably means...
... More spores coming.
I saw it. Faust got himself jammed in the air lock door. His body held it open.
Can we get to him?
Can we get to him?
No, I had to seal off a whole section. We'd lose too much of our remaining air if we opened the connecting door.
Poor kitty; puss puss puss.
At least we're rid of the damn monster. It must have been the first thing sucked out of the ship.
At least we're rid of the damn monster. It must have been the first thing sucked out of the ship.
No such luck. I saw it running down one of the corridors.
It was time for that a couple days ago.
That kind of remark is pointless. Now come on -- I want to hear every suggestion you can come up with, no matter how wild.
Let's hear it.
Okay. First we shut down all the cooling systems on the stardrive engines.
Okay. First we shut down all the cooling systems on the stardrive engines.
That'll blow the ship up.
That'll blow the ship up.
Right... but it'll take a few minutes for the engines to overheat and melt down the core. In the meantime, we get in the lifeboat and leave the ship.
But the lifeboat can't accelerate to light speed.
Doesn't matter -- we're already at light speed. And when we get back to the Colonies, they'll pick us up in the network.
No, it won't work and I just realized why. There's only one hypersleep freezer on the lifeboat. Only one of us could survive.
Yeah... I forgot.
Yeah... I forgot.
But the idea's good, if we could just turn it around somehow.
You know, it's funny -- this stuff we went to so much trouble to dig up -- this treasure, the paydirt -- it'll make it back to Irth just fine -- even if we're not with it.
Here, carry these.
<u>Hey watch it</u>!
It's stable; it doesn't hurt to drop it.
So what do we do? Do we ignore it and finish loading the explosives into the boat -- or do we flush it out now?
Now. If we can get it into the boat, we won't have to blow it up -- we can just eject it into space.
Yes, and maybe launch the boat and blow it too... if the others are injured.
Who gets the privilege?
All right, Martin, we'll be in touch with you on the communicator.
And you'll let me know when you've got it coming this way...
And you'll let me know when you've got it coming this way...
And you stand aside while we drive it in, then shut the hatch, launch the boat, and --
And you stand aside while we drive it in, then shut the hatch, launch the boat, and --
Kablooey.
Kill me...
What did it do to you?
What did it do to you?
Look...
That was Melkonis... it ate Hunter...
I'll get you out of there.
I'll get you out of there.
No... don't...
No... don't...
But I can save you -- get you to the Autodoc!
But I can save you -- get you to the Autodoc!
No good... it's eaten too much of me...

What can I do?

Kill me...
Headache? Dehydration?
The head's okay, but I could sink a six-pack.
The head's okay, but I could sink a six-pack.
Forget that. I want you off alcohol for at least seventy-two hours. I've got some toxin build-up tests still to run.
Can I... um... have some water? Please?
Sure.
What is it?
It's nothing, Doc. Just a... touch of indigestion... something.
It's nothing, Doc. Just a... touch of indigestion... something.
Do you want a tablet?
Better?
Yeah...
Me either. I tell you, I used to be with a mining outfit on Callisto, and when something like that hits... believe me, you know about it.
Do you wanna head back and call it in?
Nada. No radiation... no movement... nothing.
Well, just keep looking. It's gotta be... whoa, Jesus!
It's a rhino.
Is it dead?
Is it dead?
No, it's still breathing. Kinda clammy though. Are you sure your stick's not broken.
Yeah, it's fine.
God, I hope that thing didn't bring down a virus.
God, I hope that thing didn't bring down a virus.
I told you we... what's that?
Looks like a spore. Fungus of some kind, maybe?
Bloody big if it is. Top's open.
Let's get back and call this in.
Wait a minute.
Nice howitzer you've got there.
Thanks.
Thanks.
Good argument for gun-control. What are you going after, rhino?
Good argument for gun-control. What are you going after, rhino?
Nah. I just wanna squeeze off a few rounds. 'Sides, they tagged the rhinos for the migration project, so they're protected. They'll dock you a month's pay for just mentioning it.
We've got no option. We're gonna have to get it off.
Oh man...
Minh...
Yep...
That's the second time I ran it, and it still reads the same.
Better tell the boss.
A pair of incomings. They popped-up on the medium-range about thirteen twenty-four local time.
We figured on it being a magnetic anomaly, but we ran a back-trace just to make sure.
We figured on it being a magnetic anomaly, but we ran a back-trace just to make sure.
Yeah. Turns out they dropped straight out of hyperspace.
Can you patch me a temporary loop on DCMGS?
Okay, give me the numbers.
What do you need?
A three-second burn to port, on my mark.
A three-second burn to port, on my mark.
It's on the board.
Seal everything now!
What's happening?
What's happening?
Cassie, thank Christ! We're under attack.
Cassie, thank Christ! We're under attack.
We're what!?
How many of them are there?
Too many.
Give or take.
We're not gonna make it, are we?
Are you alright?
What? What's wrong? What is it?
Where is she?
Comin' up the Central Reservoir.
Comin' up the Central Reservoir.
Quick! Run a trace on the culvert leading off the auto-shop maintenance pit.
I found it...
And?
And?
Drains right into the Central Reservoir.
Drains right into the Central Reservoir.
Get her on-line. Now!
I can't reach her. Too much signal break-up.
Keep trying!
MarsCo went belly-up on the Dow Jones.
Shit. When?
Shit. When?
Yesterday. We got the Network feed from Gateway; it was the top story on 'Sixty Seconds'. Biggest market crash since twenty-four.
Fucking great. I invested some money in them.
You win some, you loose some.
You win some, you loose some.
I lose 'em all, that's why I'm still out here on this rock. Anything else you wanna ruin my day with?
I lose 'em all, that's why I'm still out here on this rock. Anything else you wanna ruin my day with?
No, but I got something that might interest you.
Curious thing is, the mass detector says they're too small to carry a deep-space drive.
Sounds like a couple of escape shuttles.
Where're they headed?
We ran a trajectory simulation. If they carry on along that path, it's possible they'll make intra-orbital insertion.
When?
Seven minutes ago, the third course change in an hour. Those incomings are going to skim past the communications platform just a little too close for comfort.
Seven minutes ago, the third course change in an hour. Those incomings are going to skim past the communications platform just a little too close for comfort.
Can we move it to a different orbit in time?
Picking up velocity.
Match it!
What's going on?
The door's sealed from inside. Doc Revna's in there, and it sounds like Ackland's going nuts.
The door's sealed from inside. Doc Revna's in there, and it sounds like Ackland's going nuts.
Force the door.
It's too late!
Nooooo!
Unconfirmed reports of eighteen or so far, but the numbers are all over the place.
What's our weapons situation?
Auto-shop's sealed, but those boys are cut-off.
Has anybody talked to them?
Has anybody talked to them?
Not yet.
Not yet.
Do it.
Oh, man...
Alright, let's keep calm. We've got to have an option of some sort... there's got to be a way out of this.
How much air-time have I got?
About thirty minutes. Those are slimmed-down tanks, so no stopping to admire the scenery.
About thirty minutes. Those are slimmed-down tanks, so no stopping to admire the scenery.
Deal.
Deal.
We've dumped the whole data-base from one of the cleaning remotes into the helmet. It'll project the route through the sewer system onto the inside of the glass as you go.
If I can get to the chopper, I'll meet you at the rendezvous. Don't wait for me.
But...
C'mon, man. One more sweep.
One more sweep... one more sweep. I'm getting tired of one more fuckin' sweep. We're been lookin' for this thing for three days now, and found zip.
One more sweep... one more sweep. I'm getting tired of one more fuckin' sweep. We're been lookin' for this thing for three days now, and found zip.
Ah, quit griping. Keeps you in shape doesn't it?
Ah, quit griping. Keeps you in shape doesn't it?
Hey! I was in shape before we started doing this.
Listen to what?
That's what I mean. This is the quietest I've ever heard it. It's unnatural.
De Vries?
Yeah?
Yeah?
Next time you have a thought like that? Keep it to yourself.
Something spooking the rhinos?
I dunno.
Hey, Guttierez?
What?
What?
Take a look at this.
One of 'em must have escaped.
That's impossible, man. This fence is high-tensile. The breaking tolerance'd stand up to the strain of a rhino, easy. I know, I put it up.
There's no way a rhino'd survive that drop.
Goldsmith's gonna be plenty pissed at losing one of her babies.
Goldsmith's gonna be plenty pissed at losing one of her babies.
That's a fact.
Whoa, wait a minute...
What?
What?
Just got a reading...
What? Are you nuts? Just the two of us?
I've seen this mother, De Vries. We can bag it, no problem.
I've seen this mother, De Vries. We can bag it, no problem.
Forget it, man.
Forget it, man.
C'mon De Vries. Think of the bonus.
C'mon De Vries. Think of the bonus.
Fuck the bonus. I hate heights. You wouldn't get me up there even if it wasn't night.
What the hell are you doing?
Hey, fair enough. If you won't come, I'll handle it myself.
Alright, okay. Look...
What?
What?
I'll come with you.
But I'm going first...
Anything you say, Mammacitta.
Careful of that edging there...
Yeah, I got it.
Still got him?
It's moving slow. About... eleven metres. On the left.
Hold it, hold it...
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
I'm picking up another signal.
What? Where?
Just behind us, over to the right.
Can't see a thing. Are you sure?
Yeah, I...
Wait. Lost it.
How?
How?
I dunno. Might be a glitch.
Oh, man. That's no glitch!
It's alright, it's cool...
It's alright, it's cool...
Is it still moving?
Is it still moving?
No, he's stopped; he's totally still. Just take it nice and easy, babe. Nice and easy...
Move it baby, or they're gonna be chewin' on my cojones!
Couple more seconds!
Miss Noguchi! You're wanted in admin.
Thanks.
What happened?
York just turned up outside. We're trying to get him into Infirmary.
Secondary fluidic shunt for the sewage system. I found the grating ripped right off. The little fucker was strong.
Where does that lead to?
Nobody wander off on their own until it's found. Keep in pairs. Diller, once the first team's done their sweep I want you to go down with Annie to Three-Pump while she replaces it.
Okay.
Okay.
One final point. Killing this sonuvabitch ought to be a reward in itself. However, just to add a little incentive... I'm authorizing a hefty bonus in the next pay-packet for whoever does.
Shit! Our armory's a big blue box from the back shelf of stores. We got about two clips left for an autoloader, and that's it.
Auto-shop?
That sounds promising. Can we operate the crane from here?
Nah. It's got programmable facilities, but it was never rigged for remote operation. Someone'd have to go up to the cab to get it up and running.
Nah. It's got programmable facilities, but it was never rigged for remote operation. Someone'd have to go up to the cab to get it up and running.
Which mean physically going outside.
Is this the suit?
Uh-huh.
Yeah, I stripped down a motion tracker and hardwired it through to the helmet pick-ups, too. That's also on the display.
Sounds great.
We had to. They were just too cumbersome for some of the conduits you're gonna have to negotiate. Besides, all the crap floating around reduces visibility to the extent where I doubt having helmet lights would have make that much difference, anyway. Maintenance lights down there oughta be enough to do the trick.
How tight are these shafts?
Hey, Jan. See if you can get someone to check out the chopper.
What's the problem?
What's the problem?
She was running a little sluggish on the way back. Think the turbines might be playing up.

Give me twenty minutes and I'll do it myself.
Give me twenty minutes and I'll do it myself.
Appreciate that.
And...?
And, nothing. They checked out just fine.
That's what we thought.
Have you got an updated Lloyds' Almanac to cross-reff them through?
Have you got an updated Lloyds' Almanac to cross-reff them through?
Done it already. Nothing matches.
Fort Powell. What do we tell 'em?
Just give them the facts. They can leap to their own conclusions.
Already working on it.
Get off an all-bands emergency distress, and put it on a repeater.
They've changed their heading again.
Compensate!
Compensate!
Punch me in a solution for their delta-vee.
It left a melted trail on the deck all the way down to here...
What is that?
Central Pumping. All the waste gets treated, broken-down, and flushed out into the swamp. If it wanted a quick exit then it really lucked- out.
You've checked that end?
Everything on this module is locked and sealed. We've lost 'B', 'C', and 'E' wings, but 'E' was the only one we didn't manage to totally evacuate.
How many... how many people are missing?
They knocked out the external feeds.
Looks like it.
Communications to auto-shop go through an F.O. link off the main trunk. That's down with the other feeds.
Well... try the headset.
It's not all good news. We had to take off the helmet lights. You'll be going in blind.
What? Why?
There's still time to back-out.
Forget it. I wouldn't ask somebody to do something I wouldn't do myself. Where's the disk?
Thanks.
Let's just run through it one more time so I know you've got it straight.
Let's just run through it one more time so I know you've got it straight.
Okay, I pull the access panel off of the console. Insert the disk, and press the green enabling button...
Sorry. Two green enabling buttons...
Right. When you've done that, don't waste any time getting out of there. Once that crane starts moving...well, it's bound to provoke some kind of response.
Okay, we're in business.
Right. Auto-shop, you all set?
Okay, I'm out of here!
Blow those suckers, Driscoll!
See that sheathing on the suspension? Eaten away. Same thing with the pumps on the base air purifiers. The algae out here just isn't good on these new plastics.
We haven't used Big Bertha since we relocated the generator module. That was four months ago. I can't ask for them to keep bringing spares in on the shuttle, it's already costing too much as it is.
Hey, boss. Wondered where you'd gotten to.
I just... wanted to be put on my own for a while. Clear my head.
I just... wanted to be put on my own for a while. Clear my head.
Didn't feel like whoopin' it up with the rest of us blue collars, huh?
I've got a lot of thinking to do. 'Sides, the room was getting too crowded for me.
Not too much of the socializing type, then?
Not too much of the socializing type, then?
No, not really. More sort of the 'claustrophobic' type.
I'm serious. That's why I switched from orbiting to planetary installations.
Is that a fact.
Is that a fact.
Uh-huh. Used to get it pretty bad. I'd wake up in a cold sweat and want to claw open a vacuum hatch.

How long you been out here for now, anyway? Three months?

Six month stint on Datus.

Only six?

What is this? 'Twenty Questions'?
What is this? 'Twenty Questions'?
Just curious. There's a lot of talk goes around.
What is that?
Real man' drink.
Seltzer?
Want some?
Any luck raising Ackland's party?
Nothing. With the satellite down, we can't transmit over the mountain range. He's most likely sitting there wondering why he can't raise us.
Nothing. With the satellite down, we can't transmit over the mountain range. He's most likely sitting there wondering why he can't raise us.
First light, we'll take a chopper out there and tell them to head back.
First light, we'll take a chopper out there and tell them to head back.
'We'? You wanna fly out there with me?
'We'? You wanna fly out there with me?
Sure. Do me good to stretch my legs.
Don't worry about it. If the Network goes by the book, like everyone figures they will, a Marine gunboat from Powell'll drop-by for a look- see in four-or-five days. They can go poke around out there and find whatever it was hit us. All we've gotta do is sit tight.
Do you think Ackland'll sit tight?
Do you think Ackland'll sit tight?
There'd have to be a helluva good reason for him not to.
Yeah. Somebody won.
Check out the tent.
I've found Ackland!
Hold on...
I'm going to need you to co-sign the report. Until we come up with something, this'll be treated as first degree murder.
Agreed.
Agreed.
When we get the link back, and I send this in, I.C.C.'ll throw a fit.
When we get the link back, and I send this in, I.C.C.'ll throw a fit.
Ah, don't worry about I.C.C. They're the least of your problems right now.
Ah, don't worry about I.C.C. They're the least of your problems right now.
What do you mean?
Think I spoke too soon...
Again? How long before we start noticing the difference?
Do you believe him?
Ackland? I don't know him well enough to say. If we were back on Earth we could run him though an Aldhoven test and find out for sure. There's not much we can do out here.
Cornering it shouldn't be a problem. Each part of this station is basically a self-sufficient deep-space transport module running off external couplers. If we disconnect them and seal off every section, we've got a ceiling of about thirty-six hours on internal power. That should give us ample time to find it.
Alright. Pull some trackers and headsets out of stores, and I'll sign a release for the weapons. Cassie, organise a team roster and put it on the board.
So, what do you think?
What do I think? I think if those Marines from Powell don't shift their butts getting here, we're gonna get caught up to our necks in the middle of something we shouldn't.
What?
I'm out of ammo. Get inside, get inside!
That's the wrong way!
Detour. Other way's blocked...
Hurry it up.
Don't wait for me!
They...they snapped my legs to fit... fit me in here. I don't...remember what happened next.
What can I do?
What can I do?
I can... feel it moving around inside me. You've got to kill me.
I can... feel it moving around inside me. You've got to kill me.
I... I can't!
I... I can't!
You have to...
You have to...
No!
Where'd you leave them?
Camped out by the navi-beacon out on Linson's Range. They're making their own way back tomorrow.
Jesus.
Yeah, exactly. Those're pre-programmed course adjustments you're looking at.
Yeah, exactly. Those're pre-programmed course adjustments you're looking at.
Tactical nukes, maybe?
How's it going?
Yeah, 'Good Evening' to you, too.
Today's party's finished their sweep, the relief team's out there now. Everybody else is either asleep or running shift in the auto-shop.
You should hit the sack, too.
You should hit the sack, too.
Nah, I'll stick it out for another hour or so.
Nah, I'll stick it out for another hour or so.
What time's sundown?

'Bout five minutes.
'Bout five minutes.
Give me a yell is something happens.

Of course your performance was no surprise to me. After the other day I regarded it as no more than - a promised fulfilled.

Very well, plainly and distinctly. Although I consider it unnecessary - because you know as well as I, what I am about to say. Lloyd may leave Karen, but he will not leave Karen for you.

Answer my question! Weren't you paid to get out of town?

I had lunch with Karen not three hours ago. As always with women who want to find out things, she told more than she learned... ... do you want to change your story about Lloyd beating at your door the other night?

Every now and then, some elder statesman of the Theater or cinema assures the public that actors and actresses are just plain folk. Ignoring the fact that their greatest attraction to the public is their complete lack of resemblance to normal human beings.

We never met. That's why.
Miss Caswell is an actress. A graduate of Copacabana School of Dramatic Arts. Ah... Eve.
This must be, at long last, our formal introduction. Until now we have met only in passing...

You next move, it seems to me, should be toward television.
Tell me this. Do they have auditions for television?
That's all television is, my dear. Nothing but auditions.
It is senseless to insist that theatrical folk in New York, Hollywood and London are no different from the good people of Des Moines, Chillicothe and Liverpool. By and large, we are concentrated gatherings of neurotics, egomaniacs, emotional misfits, and precocious children-

Outside of a beehive, Margo, your behavior would hardly be considered either queenly or motherly!
You're in a beehive, pal, didn't you know? We're all busy little bees, full of stings, making honey day and night- - aren't we, honey?
It's a good thought.
It won't play.
Happy little housewife...
Cut it out.
Cut it out.
This is my house, not a theater! In my house you're a guest, not a director-!
Need any help?
To put me to bed? Take my clothes off, hold my head, tuck me in, turn off the lights, tiptoe out...? eve would. Wouldn't you, Eve?
Don't let me kill the point. Or isn't it a story for grownups?
You've heard it. About when I looked through the wrong end of a camera finder.

Mad! Darling, there are certain characteristics for which you are famous - on stage and off. I love you for some of them - and in spite of others. I haven't let those become too important to me.

She hasn't cut them yet, and you know it! So when you start judging an idealistic dreamy-eyed kid by the barroom, Benzedrine standards of this megalomaniac society - I won't have it!

Many of your guests have been wondering when they may be permitted to view the body. Where has it been laid out?
It hasn't been laid out, we haven't finished with the embalming. As a matter of fact, you're looking at it. The remains of Margo Channing. Sitting up. It is my last wish to be buried sitting up.

We usually wind up screaming and throwing things as the curtain comes down. Then it comes up again and everything's fine. But not this time.
Bill... ... where are you going? To find Eve?
That suddenly makes the whole thing believable.
The so-called art of acting is not one for which I have a particularly high regard...

Often enough to keep the franchise.
A foursquare, upright, downright, forthright married lady... that's for me. And no more make believe! Off stage or on... remember, Lloyd. I mean it, now. Grown-up women only, I might even play a mother - only one child, of course, not over eight... Lloyd, will you promise not to be angry with me?
Hello, what's your name?
Eve. Eve Harrington.

If I haven't, I'll find something till you're normal.
There are some human experiences, Birdie, that do not take place in a vaudeville house - and that even a fifth-rate vaudevillian should understand and respect! I want to apologize for Birdie's-
You don't have to apologize for me! I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings. It's just my way of talkin'...
She, too, is a great admirer of yours.
Imagine. All this admiration in just one room.
Kill the people. Got your key?

Who are you?
Miss Harrington...
Miss Harrington...
What are you doing here?

I - I guess I fell asleep.
Please don't have me arrested, please! I didn't steal anything - you can search me!
How did you get in here?

I hid outside in the hall till the maid came to turn down your bed. She must've forgot something and when she went to get it, she left the door open. I sneaked in and hid till she finished. Then I just looked around - and pretty soon I was afraid somebody'd notice the lights were on so I turned them off - and

About how you live, what kind of clothes you wear - what kind of perfume and books - things like that. You know the Eve Harrington clubs - that they've got in most of the girls' high schools?

Oh, no. I see the play.

Well...
Eve... why don't you start at the beginning?
It couldn't possibly interest you.
You're not going, are you?

Tell me, Eve - how are things with you? Happy?
There should be a new word for happiness. Being here with Miss Channing has been - I just can't say, she's been so wonderful, done so much for me-
Lloyd says Margo compensates for underplaying on the stage by overplaying reality... ... next to that sable, my new mink seems like an old bedjacket... ... you've done your share, Eve. You've worked wonders with Margo...

Well... Miss Channing's affairs are in such good shape... there isn't enough to keep me as busy as I should be, really - not that I've ever considered anything that would take me away from her... but the other day - when I heard Mr. Fabian tell Miss Channing that her understudy was going to have a baby, and they'd have to replace her...
... you want to be Margo's new understudy.
I don't let myself think about it, even- - but I do know the part so well, and every bit of the staging, there'd be no need to break in a new girl- - but suppose I had to go on one night? To an audience that came to see Margo Channing. No, I couldn't possibly...

Don't worry too much about that. Margo just doesn't miss performances. If she can walk, crawl or roll - she plays.

You won't forget it?

I seem to be forever thanking you for something, don't I?
You mustn't mind Margo too much, even if I do...

No, Eve, I won't forget...
May I have your coat?
Don't bother, I can take it up myself...

We're having lunch with a movie talent scout.
They certainly don't waste much time.

I've got a lot to say. And none of it is easy.

Why shouldn't you? Please sit down.
You know, I've always considered myself a very clever girl. Smart. Good head on my shoulders, that sort of thing, never the wrong word at the wrong time... but then, I'd never met Addison deWitt. I remember once I had a tooth pulled. They gave me some anaesthetic - I don't remember the name - and it affected me in a strange way. I

You've really got a low opinion of me, haven't you? We'll I'll give you some pleasant news. I've been told off in no uncertain terms all over town. Miss Channing should be happy to hear that. To know how loyal her friends are - how much more loyal they are than she had a right to expect me to be...
Eve... don't cry.
I'm not crying.

I wish I'd never met him, I'd like him to be dead... I want my friends back.
Eve. I - I don't think you meant to cause unhappiness. But you did. More to yourself, perhaps - as it turned out - than to anyone else...
I'll never get over it.
I'll never get over it.
Yes, you will. You Theater people always do. Nothing is forever in the Theater. Love or hate, success or failure - whatever it is, it's here, it flares up and burns hot - and then it's gone.

That won't be necessary. Addison knows how Margo happen to miss that performance - how I happened to know she'd miss it in time to call him and notify every paper in town... ... it's quite a story. Addison could make quite a thing of it - imagine how snide and vicious he could get and still write nothing but the truth. I had
A part in a play. You'd do all that - just for a part in a play.
I'd do much more - for a part that good.
She knows enough not to be here.
But not all of it - not that Lloyd and I are going to be married.
Congratulations, Eve.
Thank you, Karen.
Hello, Miss Harrington.
How do you do, Mr. Richards.
No, thank you. Yes. I've seen every performance.
Every performance? Then - am I safe in assuming you like it?
Every performance? Then - am I safe in assuming you like it?
I'd like anything Miss Channing played...
How'd hear about it?
There was an item in the Times. i like the title. 'Footsteps on the Ceiling'.
There was an item in the Times. i like the title. 'Footsteps on the Ceiling'.
Let's get back to this one. Have you really seen every performance? Why? I'm curious...
Well... it started with the play before this one...
'Remembrance'.
I guess it started back home. Wisconsin, that is. There was just mum, and dad - and me. I was the only child, and I made believe a lot when I was a kid - I acted out all sorts of things... what they were isn't important. But somehow acting and make-believe began to fill up my life more and more, it got so
Not at all...
Not at all...
Farmers were poor in those days, that's what dad was - a farmer. I had to help out. So I quit school and I went to Milwaukee. I became a secretary. In a brewery. When you're a secretary in a brewery - it's pretty hard to make believe you're anything else. Everything is beer. It wasn't much fun, but it helped at home -
It's been a real pleasure, Eve.
I hope so, Mr. Richards. Good night...
Back to Copacabana. But Eve. Margo, let me tell you about Eve-
I was dreadful, Miss Channing, believe me - I have no right to be anyone's understudy, much less yours...
Please, don't misunderstand me, Mr. Richards. I think that part of Miss Channing's greatness lies in her ability to choose the best plays... your new play is for Miss Channing, isn't it, Mr. Richards?
Of course it is.
Well. If I didn't come to see the play, I wouldn't have anywhere else to go.
There are other plays...
There are other plays...
Not with you in them. Not by Mr. Richards...
Did you see it here in New York?
San Francisco. It was the last week. I went one night... the most important night in my life - until this one. Anyway... I found myself going the next night - and the next and the next. Every performance. Then, when the show went East - I went East.
No, don't go...
The four of you must have so much to say to each other - with Mr. Sampson leaving...
Stick around. Please. Tell you what - we'll put Stanislavsky on his plane, you and I, then go somewhere and talk.
Well - if I'm not in the way...
Well - if I'm not in the way...
I won't be a minute.

I could watch you play that last scene a thousand times and cry every time-

You certainly can. Especially if you're me between now and tomorrow morning...

Mr. Sampson's birthday. I certainly wouldn't forget that. You'd never forgive me. As a matter of fact, I sent him a telegram myself...
Don't get up. And please stop acting as if I were the queen mother.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to-
If you'd like.
I wouldn't like.
I'd like to hear it.

Thank you, Eve. I'd like a Martini - very dry.
Good evening, Mr. deWitt.
I had no idea you knew each other.
Terribly sorry I'm late, lunch was long and I couldn't find a cab - where's Miss Caswell, shall we start? Oh, hello, Eve...
Hello, Miss Channing.
Hello, Miss Channing.
How are you making out in Mr. Fabian's office? I don't want you working the child too hard, Max - just because you promised. As you see, I kept my promise, too...

It's the tight girdle that does it.
I find these wisecracks increasingly less funny! 'Aged in Wood' happens to be a fine and distinguished play-

I'm so sorry... Harrington. Won't you sit down?
Would you like a drink? It's right beside you...
I was telling Margo and Lloyd about how often you'd seen the play...
Margo, really...
Please don't play governess, Karen, I haven't your unyielding good taste, I wish I'd gone to Radcliffe too but father wouldn't hear of it - he needed help at the notions counter... I'm being rude now, aren't I? OR should I say "ain't I"?
Margo, nothing you've ever done has made me as happy as your taking Eve in...
I'm so happy you're happy.

Besides something called temperament, which consists mostly of swooping about on a broomstick creaming at the top of my voice... infants behave the way I do, you know. They carry on and misbehave - they'd get drunk if they knew how - when they can't have what they want. When they

He's in love with you.

Isn't that what they always say?
I don't suppose the heater runs when the motor doesn't?
Silly, isn't it? You'd think they'd fix it so people could just sit in a car and keep warm...
About Eve. I've acted pretty disgracefully toward her, too.
Well...
Well...
Let's not fumble for excuses, not here and now with my hair down. At best, let's say I've been oversensitive to... well, to the fact that she's so young - so feminine and helpless. To so many things I want to be for Bill... funny business, a woman's career. The things you drop on your way up the ladder, so you can move faster.
Margo. Margo, I want you to know how sorry I am about this...
About what?
About what?
This. I can't tell you how sorry I am!
This. I can't tell you how sorry I am!
Don't give it another thought, one of destiny's many pranks. After all, you didn't personally drain the gasoline out of the tank...
"... my hat which has, lo, these many seasons become more firmly rooted about my ears, is lifted to Miss Harrington. I am once more available for dancing in the streets and shouting from the housetops." ... I thought that one went out with Woollcott... Down here... here, listen to this- "... Miss Harrington had much to tell - and these columns shall report

I can't believe Eve said those things!

The little witch must have had Indians runners out snatching critics out of bars, steam rooms and museums or wherever they hole up... well, she won't get away with it! Nor will Addison deWitt and his poison pen! If Equity or my lawyer can't or won't do anything about it, I will personally stuff that pathetic little lost lamb down Mr. deWitt's ugly throat...
Karen, in all the years of our friendship, I have never let you go to the Ladies' Room alone. But now I must. I am busting to know what goes on in that feverish little brain waiting there...
Well... all right.

How was the concert?
Loud.

The critics thought so, the audiences certainly think so - packed houses, tickets for months in advance - I can't see that either of Lloyd's last two plays have hurt you any!

Easy, now...
You can't put her out, I promised... Margo, you've got to see her, she worships you, it's like something out of a book-
That book is out of print, Karen, those days are gone. Fans no longer pull the carriage through the streets - they tear off clothes and steal wrist watches...

If you'd only see her, you're her whole life - you must have spotted her by now, she's always there...
Now let's not get into a big hassle-
It's about time we did! It's about time Margo realized that what's attractive on stage need not necessarily be attractive off.
Coming?
In a minute...
Lloyd, what happened...?
Up to here! That's where I've got it - up to here! Of all the star ridden, presumptuous, hysterical-

Margo. Margo's great. She knows it. That's the trouble. She can play Peck's Bad Boy all she wants, and who's to stop her? Who's to give her that boot in the rear she needs and deserves?
It's going to be a cozy weekend.

Just a little skid, that's all. This road's like glass.
But it can't be! We can't be out of gas! I filled it myself yesterday! Wasn't it full when you drove to Brewster this morning?

- it's Addison, from start to finish, it drips with his brand of venom... taking advantage of a kid like that, twisting her words, making her say what he wanted her to say-

Now you're quoting Addison. Or Eve.
Eve did mention the play, you know. But just in passing - she's never ask to play a part like "Cora," she'd never have the nerve...
Eve would ask Abbott to give her Costello.

Lloyd Richards, you are not to consider giving that contemptible little worm the part of "Cora."
Now just a minute-

It strikes me that Eve's disloyalty and ingratitude must be contagious!
All this fuss and hysteria because an impulsive kid got carried away by excitement and the conniving of a professional manure slinger named deWitt! She apologized, didn't she?
On her knees, I have no doubt! Very touching, very Academy-of-Dramatic Arts!

Margo - and Bill - want us to meet them at the Cub Room tonight, after theater. For a bottle of wine.
Margo in the Cub Room. I couldn't be more surprised if she'd said Grant's Tomb.

They'd die without each other.
Darling, I didn't promise Eve anything. Just said I thought she'd be fine for the part, but there were some practical difficulties...
Such as?
Such as?
You - for one. I told her you were set on Margo playing the part - and I certainly wouldn't make a change without your approval.
Well of all-
Margo!
Three days, that's for the bourgeois - I see a midnight elopement, waking up a village person...
What are you going to wear?
After all, maybe she just wants to apologize...
I have no possible interest in anything she'd have to say.
- well? What happened?
Nothing much. She apologized.
You mean - all this time - she'd done nothing but apologize? What'd you say?
Not much.
What's so funny?
Nothing...
Who is it? What's it all about?
Did Miss Harrington tell you to call Mr. Richards?
I didn't think you would! It seems to me, Karen, that for some tine, now, you've been developing a deep unconcern for the feeling of human being in general-
I'm a human being, I've got some!
I'm a human being, I've got some!
- and for my feelings in particular! For my play, my career - and now for a frightened, hysterical girl on the eve of her first night in the Theater!
Have you forgotten about Eve? What she is, what she's done?
Old wives' tales, born of envy and jealousy! And a phobia against truth!
Old wives' tales, born of envy and jealousy! And a phobia against truth!
Then tell me this isn't true! That your concern for your play and career is one thing - and that poor frightened hysterical girl another - and that your concern for her has nothing to do with either your play or your career!
Honey chili had a point. You know, I can remember plays about women - even from the South - where it never even occurred to them whether they wanted to marry their fathers more than their brothers...
That was way back...
That was way back...
Within your time, buster. Lloyd, honey, be a playwright with guts. Write me one about a nice, normal woman who shoots her husband.
Would you, really? How sweet-
I doubt very much that you'd like her in 'The Hairy Ape'.
How about calling it a night?
And you pose as a playwright. A situation pregnant with possibilities - and all you can think of is everybody to go to sleep...
I like that girl. That quality of quiet graciousness...
... Among so many quiet qualities.
The general atmosphere is very Macbethish. What has or is about to happen?
What is he talking about?
There you are, both of you. Max, Karen has decided it's time to go.
Where is she?
Where is she?
Up in the room.
Who's left out there?
Too many. And you've got a new guest. A movie star from Hollywood.
Too many. And you've got a new guest. A movie star from Hollywood.

Just one person. Isn't that so? You know what this is all about, don't you? It has very little to do with whether you should play "Cora" - it has everything to do with the fact that you've had another fight with Bill.
She's your understudy.

It seems almost inconceivable that I haven't seen her backstage, but with so many people loitering around... well, well. So Eve is not working for Max after all- - Max you sly puss.
I'm sure you underestimate yourself, Eve. You always do. You were about to tell me about Eve...
You'd have been proud of her.

Then you listened as if someone else had written you play - whom did you have in mind? Sherwood? Arthur Miller? Beaumont and Fletcher?
I shall never understand the weird process by which a body with a voice suddenly fancies itself a mind! Just when exactly does an actress decide they're her words she's saying and her thoughts she's expressing?

Thank you, Lloyd. Godspeed.
It's been quite a night. I understand that your understudy - Miss Harrington - has given her notice.
Too bad.
Yes, sir.
City Hall, that's for prize fighters, and reporters - I see a cathedral, a bishop, banks of flowers...
Very discreet. A note right out in the open like that. Next time tell your lover to blow smoke rings - or tap a glass...
Lloyd, I want you to be big about this... the world is full of love tonight, no woman is safe...
... and Bill. Especially Bill. Eve did that, too.
You know, she probably means well, after all...

Now wait a minute, you're always so touchy about his plays, it isn't the part - it's a great part. And a fine play. But not for me anymore - not a foursquare, upright, downright, forthright married lady.
What's your being married got to do with it?
What's your being married got to do with it?
It means I've finally got a life to live! I don't have to play parts I'm too old for - just because I've got nothing to do with my nights! I know you've made plans. I'll make it up to you, believe me. I'll tour a year with this one, anything - only you do understand - don't you, Lloyd?

Supposed you dropped dead. What about your inventory?
I ain't gonna die. Not with a hit.
Margo. You by any chance got bicarbonate of soda in the house?
Poor Max. Heartburn? It's that Miss Caswell. I don't know why she doesn't give Addison heartburn.

I love you, Max. I really mean it. I love you. Come to the pantry.

Carl?
Yeah?

Fuck you, Carl.

My first day as a copy boy I was sixteen and wearing my only grown-up suit--it was cream colored. At 2:30 the head copy boy comes running up to me and says, "My God, haven't you washed the carbon paper yet? If it's not washed by three, it'll never by dry for tomorrow."

Nothing--I just found out that Jeb Magruder from CREEP is a bigger bike freak than I am. I never like it when the other guy's human...
--there had to be a White House overseer--
--Colson.
Look--five men controlled that slush fund as CREEP--three of them we've got, Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, and we're pretty sure of Kalmbach.

Segretti criss-crossed the country over ten times in six months--and never stayed anyplace over a night or two. Switch to another station, huh? You're driving me crazy with that.

You think we're being set up?--Christ, Deep Throat tells you last night that the letter came from inside the White House and up traipses Marilyn naming names.

You overslept?
Goddamnit!--
I finally got through to Sloan--it was all a misunderstanding that we had: he would have told the Grand Jury about Haldeman, he was ready to, only nobody on the Grand Jury asked him the goddamn question.

Hey... very tense.
Lot of pressure at the Star. Carl, when we got married, you were four thousand dollars in debt; when we split, you were solvent. That may prove to be the outstanding single achievement of my life, and now look at this. How much did the damn bike cost?
