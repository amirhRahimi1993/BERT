Let's find a telephone.
Sure-- But, before you do that, since we're putting all our cards on the table, I have a confession to make, too.
Don't be afraid. You can tell me.
You're sure...
You're sure...
We found each other, didn't we?
We found each other, didn't we?
Yes. We did.
Yes. We did.
It's alright... this is our destiny.
What?
My name isn't Damon Bradley. I just told you it was Damon Bradley.
My name isn't Damon Bradley. I just told you it was Damon Bradley.
What is it?
I don't get it. She hasn't seen her since she was a kid, now just because she's dying, all of the sudden she's gotta see her again?
She's been acting weird lately, though. I shoulda seen it coming. Babbling on and on and on about "communication". Like I don't know how to communicate.

Let's face it. Sooner or later we all die.
Let's face it. Sooner or later we all die.
Exactly.
Who's dying?
Your great aunt.
Your great aunt.
What great aunt?
You don't think this is just infatuation, do you?
Oh no. Do you?
Oh no. Do you?
No.
I'm a liberal!
No...
No...
My car bumper has never held a winning sticker.
There is one other thing you should know about me.
Nothing you could say would change the way I feel.
Nothing you could say would change the way I feel.
I'm engaged. I'm supposed to be married in two days.
I'm engaged. I'm supposed to be married in two days.
Except possibly that.
And, he's a friend of yours. It's Dwayne.
Dwayne?
Dwayne?
Dwayne Pinsley. From high school. That's how I knew you were here. When you called, from the airport.
A very large pig.
Ask her if she knows where he is?
Ask her if she knows where he is?
Sa dov'e' lui?
No.
Ask her if she knows how I might reach him? If she has a telephone number?
Ask her if she knows how I might reach him? If she has a telephone number?
Ha un numero di telefono?
...has a prior commitment.
What's mezzaluna?
What's mezzaluna?
A restaurant. In Piazza Navona.
A restaurant. In Piazza Navona.
That's it. That's it. That's all I need to know. Bless you, thank you, thank you.
I'M NOT PUSHING IT.
Wait. I have to write this down.
Yeah, but, what if this guy lived a billion, trillion years ago? Like, what if he was a cave man, and now he's dead?
Don't be stupid, Larry. If he's my destiny, then, obviously, he has to be alive.
Yeah, but, what if he doesn't live here? Like, what if he's a cannibal in New Guinea or something?
If I live here, then he lives here. Fate wouldn't make a mistake like that. And stop talking. You're gonna ruin the spell.
We'll KNOW.
Okaaaaayyyy.
Larry! What are you doing here? Mom sent you.
No.
Larry, can I borrow your car keys?
Faith, this guy you think is Mr. Right, he's... not what you think--
Faith, this guy you think is Mr. Right, he's... not what you think--
Don't worry, it's a long story, but I know who he is. I know where to find him.
Don't worry, it's a long story, but I know who he is. I know where to find him.
But, Faith--
But, Faith--
Please, Larry. I have to hurry.
I'll bring it back as soon as I can.
But Faith--
But Faith--
What?...
You...
Hi there...
Hi there...
Before you start picking your nose, I know he put you up to it.
It was the moth stuff that gave it away, didn't it? I knew that was too much.
No, you gave a very convincing performance. And you'll be pleased to know that your eight-by-ten glossy is now on display at the local playhouse.
No, you gave a very convincing performance. And you'll be pleased to know that your eight-by-ten glossy is now on display at the local playhouse.
My picture's up?
Congratulations.
Thanks.
Thanks.
So, this is what you do? I mean when you're not playing other parts?
So, this is what you do? I mean when you're not playing other parts?
I take it things didn't work out between the two of you?
It's an amazing place, don't you think?
Amazing.
Amazing.
Smoking or non-smoking?
Smoking or non-smoking?
Non. Please.
Lots of history. For example, did you know, according to legend, this coastline used to harbor Sirens?
Hm.
Hm.
Beautiful women who could lure men to their destruction with their singing. Nobody's ever really seen them and lived to tell about it. But, I don't know. An awful lot of ships wrecked on those rocks.
Hello? Is anybody there?
Dwayne Pinsley? I'm trying to reach Dwayne Pinsley.
Dwayne Pinsley? I'm trying to reach Dwayne Pinsley.
He's not in at the moment. Can I take a message?
He's not in at the moment. Can I take a message?
Who's this?
Who's this?
This is his fiancee. Who's this?
This is his fiancee. Who's this?
Oh, hi. I'm an old high school buddy of Dwayne's. I was in town this weekend, was hoping to stop by and surprise him. But I've gotta catch a plane so I'm afraid I'm not gonna be able to make it.
I'm sure he'll be sorry to hear that. Who should I tell him called?
My name's
My name's
I can hardly hear you. Could you spell that?
Damon Bradley...
Right. Thanks a lot. And congratulations. It's not easy finding love these days.
WAIT!! Where are you?
I'm at the airport. Why?
I'm at the airport. Why?
Uh-- in case Dwayne wants to try to reach you.
Uh-- in case Dwayne wants to try to reach you.
Well, he'd have to hurry. My flight leaves at four o'clock.
Where are you going?
I'm on my way to Venice. Why?
I'm on my way to Venice. Why?
Venice? I love Venice. With the boats, right?...
Venice? I love Venice. With the boats, right?...
Huh? Uh, yeah-- I've gotta run. Tell Dwayne hi. Maybe someday we can all get together.
That's not the point.
You said whatever it was you would understand.
You said whatever it was you would understand.
That was before I found out what it was.
How could you do this to me?
I'm in love with you.
I'm in love with you.
Oh, come on... What kind of an excuse is that?
You're limping.
I know I'm limping. I stubbed my toe.
I know I'm limping. I stubbed my toe.
Are you okay? You want some help?
Are you okay? You want some help?
NO.
NO.
You are leaving, aren't you?
Why can't you just tell me?
If it's any of your business, yes.
If it's any of your business, yes.
Yes?! To be married, I suppose.
Yes?! To be married, I suppose.
Yes.
Yes.
To the foot doctor.
To the foot doctor.
Yes.
Because I know who Dwayne is, and he's reliable and stable and wants to marry me.
He's safe.
He's safe.
So?! Is there something wrong with loving somebody who's safe?
So?! Is there something wrong with loving somebody who's safe?
Does he love you?
Does he love you?
He wants to marry me, doesn't he?
He wants to marry me, doesn't he?
You didn't answer my question.
You didn't answer my question.
Why are you asking me this?
Why are you asking me this?
Because I'd like to think at least one of you feels that way. Does he know who you are?
You stubbed your toe, don't you think that's a sign?
What?
What?
He's a podiatrist. Pain is your body's way of telling you something is wrong. Your toe is trying to tell you not to do it.
There must be something I can do, something I can say to make this up to you?... Just tell me what it is, I'll say it. I'll do it. I don't want you to hate me.
Look, Peter, I don't hate you. But what we had was an illusion. Mutual wishful thinking. We both wanted to believe it for awhile, but it was all founded on a lie.
Look, Peter, I don't hate you. But what we had was an illusion. Mutual wishful thinking. We both wanted to believe it for awhile, but it was all founded on a lie.
So?
So?
So it wasn't real.
So it wasn't real.
What about the oasis in the desert? Are you telling me that was a lie?
What about the oasis in the desert? Are you telling me that was a lie?
No, that wasn't a lie. That was... a mirage.
Don't you see?.. We're not the ones who are meant to be. You're the man of somebody else's dreams.
Because I don't have the right name?!
Fine. Okay. Forget me. Leave me out of it. But don't go throwing your life away on somebody you don't love.
Who says I don't love him?...
Why not?
Because. I know where he is.
I went back to that restaurant and I spoke with his waiter, just on an off chance, you know, and, anyway-- he knew the name of the guy's hotel. So, I called there, they said he left yesterday. But, apparently he comes here every year, always follows the same route. He always goes from here down the coast to the Le Sirenuse hotel in
Where's Positano?
Where's Positano?
It's in the south. I've still got my rental car. I can get you there by morning...
It's in the south. I've still got my rental car. I can get you there by morning...
Oh no, I don't think that would be a good idea.
Oh no, I don't think that would be a good idea.
Look, I know there's no going back for us. That's not it. I just want to make this up to you. Clear my relationship karma. And I know the area, I've got some cousins down there. Please. Let me do this for you. Let this be my gift to you.
Why?
Because-- I want you to be happy.
The guy at the hotel told me he always wears a gold medallion, and usually has a book or magazine with him.
He likes to read... Did he mention anyone in particular?
Uh, I'd rather not say.
Tell me.
Tell me.
I'd really rather not say.
I'd really rather not say.
Please. I need to know.
Please. I need to know.
Mickey Spillane.
Mickey Spillane.
Mickey Spillane?
Mickey Spillane?
Or Hustler.
He's out by the pool right now.
Right now?
Right now?
Oh, and I forgot to tell you. He's here with his mother.
Do you want me to do it?
NO.
Hi, Peter.
Hi.
So. You found him.
You found him. I don't know how to thank you.
Well, it looks like we both lucked out. I just met somebody myself. Somebody my aunt introduced me to.
Oh. That's nice.
Oh. That's nice.
Yeah.
And she's a knock-out, too.
Well, good. Good for you.
Well, good. Good for you.
Anyway, that's why I came by. I need to fix this button. Do you have a needle and thread?
Where are you going? Just-- out of curiosity...
Just to that place down at the bottom of the stairs. Nothing fancy.
Oh, thanks. Well, have a good time.
You too.
Hey--
What?
What?
Nice dress.
Nice dress.
Thank you, Peter. Thank you so much.
What?...
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
We were hungry.
You were saying...
Boy, that looks tasty. What is that?
Say, I saw where they had motor boats for rent down in the harbor. Why don't we all go for an evening cruise around the bay?
I don't know if that's such a--
Why are you doing this?
I just wanted to keep an eye on you. The guy's a total stranger, remember?
I just wanted to keep an eye on you. The guy's a total stranger, remember?
So were you.
So were you.
Exactly. Besides, no hard feelings. You found somebody. I found somebody. I thought we could double.
Well, what about books? You like Hemingway? You gotta love Hemingway.
The Sun Also Rises. For Whom the Bell Tolls. The Old Man and the--
How about music? You like classical?
The Boston Pops. Season tickets.
Well, how about those old romantic movies with those great stars, huh? Like Audrey Hepburn.
Actually, I think I prefer Katherine Hepburn.
You okay?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I guess he turned out to be kind of a loser, huh?
I'm sorry.
I feel like the world's biggest idiot.
Yeah. Well, was the least I could do.
No, it was more than that. It was very generous of you. It was very kind.
Promise me you won't leave without saying goodbye.
No. Course not.
Hi.
Hi. Are you... busy?
Hi. Are you... busy?
No. Are you're leaving?
No. Are you're leaving?
No. I just came by to apologize.
It seems like ever since I found out about this guy, this name, I've been kind of crazy. Like I was on drugs or something.
I know the feeling.
I know the feeling.
Yeah... Well, anyway, I also wanted to tell you, I'm not getting married.
Yeah... Well, anyway, I also wanted to tell you, I'm not getting married.
You aren't?
You aren't?
No. I mean yes, I'm not. I decided to call it off. Well, actually, it was kind of mutual.
No. I mean yes, I'm not. I decided to call it off. Well, actually, it was kind of mutual.
Well. Congratulations.
Well. Congratulations.
Thank you. So, since I have a few more days of vacation left, I was wondering if maybe you'd want to do something sometime. I mean, you know, if you don't have... other plans.
Thank you. So, since I have a few more days of vacation left, I was wondering if maybe you'd want to do something sometime. I mean, you know, if you don't have... other plans.
Are you asking me out?
Yes. I am.
In that case... no...
You can't come to Southern Italy and not see the Blue Grotto.
I just need to run up and get my bathing suit.
I just need to run up and get my bathing suit.
Okay. I'll meet you at the dock in ten minutes.
Is something the matter?
GET OUT!!
I'd call that a yes. Do I get a hint?
You want a hint? I'll give you a hint. You are the lowest, most despicable, most reprehensible form of reptilian swine--
You want a hint? I'll give you a hint. You are the lowest, most despicable, most reprehensible form of reptilian swine--
There's no such thing.
There's no such thing.

Reptilian swine. There's no such thing. Reptiles aren't swine.
Reptilian swine. There's no such thing. Reptiles aren't swine.
Who cares?! You hired an actor??
Who cares?! You hired an actor??
I don't know what you're talking about. Who told you that?
I don't know what you're talking about. Who told you that?
No one had to tell me. He's starring in the local play.
Alright. The truth is... I thought we had something here.
I can't believe you did that!
I can't believe you did that!
And I can't believe you are so stubborn and so blind as to let some stranger, some phantom you've never even met destroy it.
And I can't believe you are so stubborn and so blind as to let some stranger, some phantom you've never even met destroy it.
You're the reason I never met him. You knew it was the thing I most wanted in life and you sabotaged it.
You're the reason I never met him. You knew it was the thing I most wanted in life and you sabotaged it.
I sabotaged it? You're the one who lost him, remember?
I sabotaged it? You're the one who lost him, remember?
Well, I might've found him again if I hadn't left Rome to make this pointless trip down here with you.
Well, I might've found him again if I hadn't left Rome to make this pointless trip down here with you.
As I recall, you were on your way home. And I didn't want you to go so, yes, I told you a little white lie.
As I recall, you were on your way home. And I didn't want you to go so, yes, I told you a little white lie.
A "little white lie"? A "little white lie"?
A "little white lie"? A "little white lie"?
What would you call it?
What would you call it?
I would call it-- unforgivable.
Don't you think you're overreacting just a little here? We're talking about love, okay? Let's be rational.
Rational?! Love is not rational! Are you crazy?
Rational?! Love is not rational! Are you crazy?
Yes. I'm crazy. You have driven me crazy. No one in their right mind would go to this much trouble to win over someone as insane as you. Did it ever, even for one second, occur to you how much work it was to set all this up? How many arrangements had to be made? How many players had to be coordinated?
Yes. I'm crazy. You have driven me crazy. No one in their right mind would go to this much trouble to win over someone as insane as you. Did it ever, even for one second, occur to you how much work it was to set all this up? How many arrangements had to be made? How many players had to be coordinated?
Gee, I'm flattered. What an incredibly romantic gesture. Cancel the roses, I've decided to lie to her instead.
Gee, I'm flattered. What an incredibly romantic gesture. Cancel the roses, I've decided to lie to her instead.
Very funny.
Very funny.
No, it isn't. I called off my wedding all because of you.
Really?...
Yes.
And this is the thanks I get. I did you a favor. You never wanted to marry that joker in the first place.
That's not the point. And what if I had wanted to?
That's not the point. And what if I had wanted to?
If you had wanted to, you'd have gone home.
Look, I just thought if you finally got rid of this obsession with this name, if you could get it out of your system once and for all, then maybe you'd be able to stop waiting and open your heart to someone real. Granted, ideally, me. I didn't do it to hurt you. I did it for you. I did it for us...
There is no us.
I was hoping for the real thing.
I brought you that, too.
You're Damon Bradley?
Uh huh.
Hello.
Beautiful place...
Beautiful place...
Sure is.
Been here long?
Just since yesterday.
Just since yesterday.
I just got here, too. Not yesterday. But, just now. Today. Just a few minutes ago. Yeah, we just got here... I mean, I just got here. I'm single.
I was wondering... Do you have dinner plans?
Tonight?
Tonight?
Any night.
Any night.
Well, not exactly...
Well, not exactly...
Would you be willing to have dinner with me?
Sure.
You would? Really?
I'll look forward to it.
Okay. Good. See you then, then.
Wait.
Yes?
Yes?
Aren't you going to tell me who you are?
Aren't you going to tell me who you are?
Oh, Faith. My name's Faith.
Oh, Faith. My name's Faith.
It's a pleasure to meet you, Faith.
Sure.
Brunello di Montalcino, '85, please.
You know, I noticed you out at the pool even before we spoke. I could sense the chemistry between us.
Really?
Really?
Really...
Well, to-- new friends.
And more...
Excuse me?
Nothing. Prices are a little steep here, aren't they?
Nothing. Prices are a little steep here, aren't they?
Don't worry about it. You're my guest.
What looks good?
Hmmmm... Well, the scampi sounds good...
Hmmmm... Well, the scampi sounds good...
You like shrimp? I like shrimp.
So what do you think?
Uh, the scampi sounds good to me, too.
Faith, this is my mother.
Oh, hello.
Oh, hello.
Mommy, this is Faith.
So, you say you've been to Italy before?
A few times. It's kind of an annual tradi--
So, what are we waiting for?
What?
What?
Let's face it. You want me.
I don't know, I guess I never really thought about it... Is Larry here?
Yeah. He's around somewhere.
I don't believe in statistics.
You're an accountant for cryin' out loud.
What about that guy you work with, Mike what's-his-name?
No. He smokes.
No. He smokes.
How about the other one? His friend.
How about the other one? His friend.
Just moved in with his girlfriend.
Just moved in with his girlfriend.
How about that guy at the bank?
Scientologist.
Oh.
So, you gotta be a little flexible. Look at your brother and me. Larry's not perfect, neither am I. But we work it out. We're not unrealistic in our expectations, and we have each other. I think you've got the Door Number Three Syndrome.
Don't tell me, Oprah did a show--
I don't have an Amana freezer.
It's a metaphor. It's women who always think there's some unknown out there that's going to be better than what's in front of them. And instead wind up with nothing.
It's a metaphor. It's women who always think there's some unknown out there that's going to be better than what's in front of them. And instead wind up with nothing.
Metaphorically, I still don't have an Amana freezer.
Metaphorically, I still don't have an Amana freezer.
I think if you're honest with yourself, you'll admit you've had a chance at a number of Amana appliances in your lifetime.
Is everything okay?
Yes. You know all the shrinks on Donahue say that all those love songs about some enchanted evening are just a cruel hoax that feeds people's fantasies.
Yes. You know all the shrinks on Donahue say that all those love songs about some enchanted evening are just a cruel hoax that feeds people's fantasies.
But somebody wrote those songs.
But somebody wrote those songs.
So, what's your point?
So, what's your point?
Just that they came out of somebody's experience is all.
Just that they came out of somebody's experience is all.
No, Faith. They came out of somebody's imagination.
I wish you didn't have to go so early.
Yeah, well, Larry and his friends are hungry. And I did say I'd try to pick something up.
No.
Is he married?
Is he married?
No.
No.
Is he gay?
Is he gay?
I don't know. I don't think so.
I don't know. I don't think so.
So?...
So?...
So, he's not my type. Let me walk you to the elevator.
What's he do?
I don't know, Kate.
I don't know, Kate.
You don't have any idea?
You don't have any idea?
He's a podiatrist or something.
"Thrills"? That's what you're waiting for? You know how long that lasts? Besides, how do you know? Have you ever been out with him?
No. He's never asked me.
No. He's never asked me.
Why don't you ask him?
Why don't you ask him?
Why should I ask someone out who I don't want to go out with in the first place?
Why should I ask someone out who I don't want to go out with in the first place?
If you've never been out with him, how do you know you don't want to go out with him?
He begged me to marry him. I didn't even want to marry him.
Yes you did.
Yes you did.
Well, I wouldn't've if I hadn't thought I was in love.
Come on, it's not so bad.
Look how big it makes me look. I look like an Alp.
Look how big it makes me look. I look like an Alp.
I think it was sweet of him to pick it out.
I think it was sweet of him to pick it out.
I know... It was.
But what?
Oh, I don't know. I guess it's just not quite the way I always thought it was going to be. You know, like in the movies.
Oh, I don't know. I guess it's just not quite the way I always thought it was going to be. You know, like in the movies.
That's the problem. When you're a kid you think life is gonna be like the movies. Dreams come true, the good guys win, people live happily ever after... all that crap. Turn.
But one day you wake up and realize you've been had. Of course life isn't like the movies. That's why there are movies.
Yeah. I guess you're right. I really like the wallpaper we picked out for the den.
Let me tell you something about love. There are no prince charmings, there are no glass slippers. Love is hard work.
I know. You're right.
I know. You're right.
People have problems, insecurities, flaws-- and you have to learn to compromise, to overlook, to forgive. It's not settling, Faith, it's life. Real life.
I understand, Kate. What do you think of this garter?
I mean, just how long are you going to cling to this childish illusion that it's all supposed to be perfect? Well, guess what?... It isn't. Not for you, not for anybody.
Kate, is something the matter?
Larry brought me flowers last night.
Larry brought me flowers last night.
Is that bad?...
Is that bad?...
I think he's having an affair.
Have you seen him with someone?
No... I can just tell.
No... I can just tell.
After all, he is my brother, and I know he can be kind of a jerk sometimes, but I know him pretty well, and I really don't think--
It's a miracle.
It's a coincidence.
It's a coincidence.
The woman at my dry cleaners believes there's no such thing as coincidence.
It was my New Year's resolution to overcome it.
But it's July.
But it's July.
It's still the new year...
It's still the new year...
What about your job?
What about your job?
I have vacation time coming to me.
I have vacation time coming to me.
You don't have a passport.
You don't have a passport.
That's where you're wrong. I got one nine years ago. I just never had an opportunity to use it.
That's where you're wrong. I got one nine years ago. I just never had an opportunity to use it.
Because you were afraid to fly.
Because you were afraid to fly.
Would you stop saying that? I need you to do me a really big favor.
Would you stop saying that? I need you to do me a really big favor.
Does Dwayne know about this?
Does Dwayne know about this?
Of course not. I told him I was going to visit a great aunt. And don't tell Larry, either.
I can't believe we did this. Do I have to remind you that your wedding is in six days?
Look, I know you think this is irresponsible of me, but think how much more irresponsible it would be to marry the wrong person.
No, I haven't. And you forgot about the fortune teller.
My God, you have...
Thank you so much.
You're just going to fly to Italy and start combing the streets?
You're just going to fly to Italy and start combing the streets?
He was on his way to Venice, right? I called the tourist bureau and I must've called every hotel in the city, but I found where he's staying.
A foreign land full of millions of Italian men... speaking Italian with Italian accents and those huge brown eyes and that silky olive skin...
How hard can it be? I'll land there, I'll go to his hotel, I'll introduce myself, and--
How hard can it be? I'll land there, I'll go to his hotel, I'll introduce myself, and--
Live happily ever after.
Live happily ever after.
Maybe.
I keep it in the glove compartment in case of emergencies.
You're coming with me?
You okay?
Sure. I'm fine. I don't know why I never did this before. I mean, what's the big deal?
Now what do we do?
The book said they have boats that are like taxis... Vaporettos. What's the name of the place we're staying again?
The book said they have boats that are like taxis... Vaporettos. What's the name of the place we're staying again?
It's called... the Gritty Palace.
It's called... the Gritty Palace.
"Gritty"? Is this gonna be one of those youth hostel dives jammed with backpackers who don't believe in deodorant?
"Gritty"? Is this gonna be one of those youth hostel dives jammed with backpackers who don't believe in deodorant?
I don't know... Maybe. Think of it as an adventure.
This is a Lifestyles hotel.
What?
What?
"Of the Rich and Famous". Of which we are neither. Are you out of your mind? We can't afford this.
"Of the Rich and Famous". Of which we are neither. Are you out of your mind? We can't afford this.
Are you sure?
Are you sure?
Yes. Cathy Lee Crosby stayed here.
Yes. Cathy Lee Crosby stayed here.
Well, we're here. And more importantly, he's here. We'll cut back on everything else.
I can't believe we came all this way and he's gone.
You gave it your best shot. You tried.
You gave it your best shot. You tried.
We lost him?...
I'll never meet the man of my dreams.
You and the other 99% of the women in the world.
Just once more, so you'll be sure to know what to look for.
Faith, I've seen it already, okay? If I spot somebody who's got a head that's an eighth of an inch around, standing underneath a tuba, I'll recognize him from the photo. Otherwise, I'm telling you, it's not gonna do me any good.
What are you doing?
He fell out.
You can't really blame him for being upset. It was an Armani suit.
Did I or did I not offer to have it cleaned?
Did I or did I not offer to have it cleaned?
I don't think he understood what you were saying. What's the airport number?
I just got a dial tone--
The guy at the desk said he only left about a half hour ago, right?
The guy at the desk said he only left about a half hour ago, right?
So?
So?
So, maybe his room hasn't been cleaned yet. Maybe there's something in there that might help us. Maybe they'll let us go in and take a look around.
Ah ha!...
What'd you find?
What'd you find?
A Butterfinger wrapper.

A rich, possibly fat, slob.

We're not looking to arrest the man, Faith, we're trying to locate him.

Oh. Right.
We're saved!
What is it?
What is it?
A phone message. Only--
A phone message. Only--
Only what?
Only what?
Only, it's in Italian...
Your brother?
What was I gonna do? Tell him the truth?
Couldn't we just have taken a train?
The book said they have a lot of rail strikes in Italy.
I told you a liter was less than a gallon.
We would've had enough gas to get us there if you hadn't gotten us lost. Besides, a kilometer is less than a mile.
We would've had enough gas to get us there if you hadn't gotten us lost. Besides, a kilometer is less than a mile.
Right. So we should've been able to cover more of them.
I'm hungry.
You know, no offense or anything Kate, but I think I'm starting to see Larry's side of the story.
You know, no offense or anything Kate, but I think I'm starting to see Larry's side of the story.
What's that supposed to mean?...
What's that supposed to mean?...
Nothing.
You expecting somebody you know?
Well, you don't have to get snippy with me.
Well, you don't have to get snippy with me.
Sorry.
So, what exactly is Larry's side of the story, anyway?
I don't know, Kate. I just said that. I'm sorry. I'm just on edge. I'm afraid we're losing him.
I don't know, Kate. I just said that. I'm sorry. I'm just on edge. I'm afraid we're losing him.
You think he misses me at all?
You think he misses me at all?
'Course he does.
'Course he does.
You know, when Larry and I got married, I thought we were so lucky we found each other so early. People talk about spending their lives together, how many of them really get to? But maybe I was wrong. Maybe sooner or later everything wears out.
That was a long time ago.
And you know what I thought then, Kate? I thought, I hope someday I have somebody who loves me that much. I still hope that.
He went out and bought himself men's cologne the other day. Did I tell you that?
Larry bought himself cologne?
Larry bought himself cologne?
Polo.
Anna, I'm Faith. You don't know how happy I am to meet you. You see, I'm trying to find someone, and--
Her brother.
Her brother.
Right. My brother.
What did you say to her?
I don't know. I just asked her if she knew him and all of the sudden--
I don't know. I just asked her if she knew him and all of the sudden--
What's she saying?
All of the sudden, I'm feeling kind of nervous. God, I hate blind dates. Why couldn't we just have arranged marriages in America?
You're right. At least that way you could spend the rest of your life blaming your parents instead of yourself. Smile.
I sort of wanted to wait to see if maybe he'd notice me first?
You've travelled over six thousand miles and now you're gonna play hard to get?
So what's in a name? I wanna join him. I don't see why we can't join him.
I told you. If he sees me here with another guy, he's gonna think I'm here with another guy. I just don't want to send any confusing signals.
Well, how come we're always looking for guys for you?
Because I'm the one who's single.
Because I'm the one who's single.
I never even got to be single.

Sure you did.

Not if you don't count the sixth grade.

Okay, okay. You join him. But first will you ask if he's here?
He's heeeeeerrre...
Oh my God. Where?
Oh my God. Where?
He's sitting in the fourth booth down, on the left hand side, with his back to us. He's wearing a navy jacket. If you turn around, you can see part of his right elbow.

Is he looking at us?
Is he looking at us?
Nope.
Right, right... Okay.. You don't think he's gonna think I'm too aggressive?
Faith. So far you've trailed the man halfway around the globe. At this point, I don't think another fifteen feet is gonna tip the scales.
Faith. So far you've trailed the man halfway around the globe. At this point, I don't think another fifteen feet is gonna tip the scales.
Right. Okay... It's meant to be right? This is it.
Faith--
What?
What?
Good luck.
Well, nobody can say we didn't try.
Okay, here's what I think. We find out what all the subway stops for that train are-- the subway system's really not that big in Rome, we could narrow it down and--
Okay, here's what I think. We find out what all the subway stops for that train are-- the subway system's really not that big in Rome, we could narrow it down and--
And then what, Faith?
And then what, Faith?
And then... we rent a truck, or a car, either one, and we set up a loudspeaker, and we drive through the surrounding areas, and we page him.
That was really sweet...
I meant about my idea.

No... Like a psychiatrist.

Don't be silly. How's a psychiatrist gonna find him?
Yeah. Sociopaths. They're able to figure out what you want them to be and then they act like that.
But how could he know? He only just met me.

Packing.
Packing.
Why?

Okay, a lot of bad luck. But that means the odds are probably in your favor now. This is no time to give up.
Why do they read kids fairy tales in the first place? Children are very impressionable, you know.
So you're just quitting? Just like that?
I thought you were the one who didn't think I should've come in the first place.
I know, but...
I know, but...
It was a ouija board, remember?

Yeah, well, obviously it wasn't meant to be. I've got forty-eight hours. I can still make it home in time to marry Dwayne and try to forget any of this ever happened.

I'm sure. And Kate, thank you for coming. Thank you for being such a good friend.
I'm sure. And Kate, thank you for coming. Thank you for being such a good friend.
I'll be back before you leave.
Peter found him?
Yes. Isn't that amazing?
Amazing...
He's down in someplace called Positano. Peter says we can make it there by morning.
Joan Collins stayed here.
Is Damon Bradley here?
Whatareyoudoing?!
What if he doesn't like me?

My God... you're right.
My God... you're right.
Faith, I'm kidding. Is this how you plan to get what you want from life? When you finally find it, you turn and run away from it?
Kate. Thank God you're there. I need help.
Uh huh... Okay, we'll be there. How is he, anyway?
Not only is he a momma's boy and a fascist, he says "nuculear" and "irregardless".
No one's perfect, Kate.
No one's perfect, Kate.
And he is living proof.
And he is living proof.
No, I think maybe you've been right. I think I may have been too critical in the past.
Maybe I can change him.
I thought this was supposed to be the one guy in the world you wouldn't need to change.
Maybe if I kiss him I'll feel it.
Or maybe it'll turn him back into a toad.
He's a jerk.
Yes. He is.
Yes. He is.
I spent my whole life waiting for a creep.

So...
So. I guess I've got a wedding to go to.
Kate is that you?
Uh huh.
Uh huh.
I didn't expect you back so soon.
Well, I realized, if you're getting married, you're gonna be needing the maid of honor, right?
Actually, no. There's not going to be a wedding.
Actually, no. There's not going to be a wedding.
Oh.
Well... I ought to be getting home anyway. The kids'll be back from camp soon. The house is probably a mess.
And Larry?...
And Larry?...
What about Larry?
What about Larry?
I don't know. I've just been thinking... maybe this destiny thing is more of a do-it-yourself operation. Maybe the things that are meant to be are the things we want badly enough to fight for.
I'm fine. Have you seen Peter?
He's gone. He told me what happened. He just left for the airport.
He's gone. He told me what happened. He just left for the airport.
Larry, did you rent a car?

No. Well, I don't know. Well, maybe. Later.

This is your most lucky day. My family runs a pension not three blocks from here.
My friend is looking for her brother and she thinks this woman knows where he is. Can you tell us what she's saying?
She's saying he's a-- a-- porco.

Oh, hello. I just came by to see if you wanted to join me for a drink, but--
I'd love to.
It's siesta.
Oh.
Oh.
You see, in America they care for work, they live to work. But in Italy, they care for food, for love, for pleasure...
How old are you?
What do the years matter? I've known you for centuries...
Giovanni, I want to thank you.
I thank you.
No, you don't understand. It's been wonderful meeting you. But... I have a husband. I have two kids at camp. I have a life I have to go back to.
You don't have to go if you don't want to...
You don't have to go if you don't want to...
But I do want to.
You think I'm just one of those Italian Casanovas. The guys who try to seduce every woman who comes their way. Who prey on unhappily married women. Who lure unsuspecting--
Giovanni.
Giovanni.
Huh?
Huh?
That's exactly what you are.
Kate, you're still there? I thought you'd be on your way home by now.
You miss me?...
You miss me?...
Uh, yeah. Sure. Honey, did you forget the guys are coming over tonight?
Uh, yeah. Sure. Honey, did you forget the guys are coming over tonight?
No, why?
No, why?
Well, there's nothing here to eat.
This is the last one before the wedding, right?
Right.
Right.
And we didn't have to bring another present?
And we didn't have to bring another present?
No.
Not only is it tacky, it's exploitation.
It's not exploitation. These people wanna sell and I wanna buy. How are golf clubs exploitation? She takes one night class and suddenly she's a socialist.

Sociologist. And because. Pawn shops are just like prostitutes, farm auctions and coal miners. They're all for sale, but none of 'em would be if they weren't desperate for the money.

You said it differently then.
Damon Bradley? That's why you're here?
What? You know him?

It was just a joke. I was pushing the arrow. I wanted to get to the next question. I wanted to find out who was gonna win the Series.

I thought she'd get a kick out of it.
It was a harmless little prank. Who in the world would've thought she'd spend her life waiting for this guy?

Larry, you've got to tell her.
Larry, you've got to tell her.
I can't tell her. She's called off her wedding. She'll never speak to me again.
I came after the woman I love.
He missed me.
Yeah--
Faith. Larry has something he wants to tell you about Damon Bradley.
She what?!
She said she knew where to find him, and then she grabbed my car keys, and--

She didn't give me a chance.
I have to talk to her.
She's not here.
She's not here.
Where is she?

She went out to check into skywriting. I can't believe you lied. Is this a genetic thing, men will say anything just to get laid?
She went out to check into skywriting. I can't believe you lied. Is this a genetic thing, men will say anything just to get laid?
No! That's not fair. That's not it at all. Look, something somewhere got screwed up. Maybe some metaphysical wires got crossed. I may not have the right name, but I was there. I'm the guy. I'm-- skywriting??
It was an emergency. I only lied that night because it was the only way I knew to stop her. I knew if I didn't, I'd never see her again.
Good strategy.
Good strategy.
Do you know I wasn't even supposed to be in Rome? My boss was supposed to come to this conference, and at the last minute he got the measles. The measles. Who gets the measles at forty-three? So they sent me. And I wasn't supposed to be in that piazza that night either. I'd gone to the movies, only it was sold out. So
And then I saw her. And all I know is, when I looked in her eyes I saw something... light. And life and passion and yearning. And something else I can't even put my finger on, something I'd never seen before--
Mania.
Mania.
Whatever. And I thought, please God, give me a sign, give me some way to keep this woman from getting into that taxi and disappearing from my life forever. And He did. She told me the name. Granted, it wasn't my name, but it was a start.
And if that's not destiny, I don't know what is.
That's really romantic.
I mean, realistically, what are the odds that this is a terrific guy?
Ten billion to one.
That's the guy you've been waiting for all these years?
Aren't you gonna go introduce yourself?
Oh, it's you. It's only Peter.
Thanks.
Thanks.
Sorry...
Right now?

You mean to sit there and tell me that your local takes in sixty-five thousand, five hundred dollars every year and keeps no financial records?

Listen kid, I'm a soft tough too. Ask any rummy on the dock if I'm not good for a fin any time they put the arm on me. But my old lady raised us ten kids on a stinkin' watchman's pension. When I was sixteen I had to beg for work in the hold. I didn't work my way up out of there for
When he got up and chased them they thought it was a dead man coming after them.
I know what's eatin' you, kid. But I got two thousand dues-payin' members in my local that's seventy-two thousand a year legitimate and when each one of 'em puts in a couple of bucks a day to make sure they work steady well, you figure it out. And that's just for openers. We got the fattest piers in the fattest harbor in the world.

So look, kid, you don't think we c'n afford to be boxed out of a deal like this a deal I sweated and bled for on account of one lousy little cheese-eater, that Doyle bum, who thought he c'd go squealin' to the Crime Commission? Do you?
I make it twentysix twenty-three. You're fifty short, Skins.

You got a real friend here, kid. Don't forget it.

Could it be some kind of college initiation?
It's an initiation all right, but not of a college as you and I know them. Nothing alive looks like that!

The Princess of Darkness would have you for her own to join us through extreme pain. Yet I am inclined for one as lovely as you, to be more lenient. I have but to touch you with my finger, and it would mean the end of you, all over, quickly and painlessly...

Oh, is this Adele?
Yes, it is.
Yes, it is.
Uh-- sorry. Wrong number.

Yes.

Tell me, how do you do that?
You were <i>both</i> in the trunk? Together?
From Glades to the turnpike. Then I left with Glenn.
The FBI didn't tell you I was with them?

I'm getting ready to go out. You can come in if you want, sit down for a minute. Would you like a Diet Coke?
No, thanks.

You mean, did he try to jump me? No, but he was kind of talkative.

He gets that way when he's nervous sometimes.
You didn't visit him in prison.
He didn't want me to.
He didn't want me to.
Why not?
Why not?
I don't know. He was different after he was sentenced, looking at thirty years. Said it depressed him every time the younger cons called him an old timer.

Did you know that when you married him?
Did you know that when you married him?
He said he was a card player. I could live with that. I never knew he robbed banks till he got busted with that car that caught fire -- if you can imagine something like that happening, comes out of the bank and the car's on fire. I did go see him in jail to tell him I was filing for divorce. He said,
I'll say one thing for Jack, he was never ugly or mean, or drank too much. He was very considerate, lights on or off, if you know what I mean.
Really. Hm.
Adele, sooner or later, he's gonna get caught. I'd like to get him before he does something else, makes it worse on himself.
Buddy'll take care of him. Keep him out've trouble. He's Jack's conscience. Always has been. He tell you how they met?
Jack came out of a bank he just robbed in Pasadena, couldn't get his stolen car to start. Battery was dead. He looks over, sees Buddy sitting in a burgundy Bonneville, goes up, offers him a thousand dollars for a jump. Turns out, Buddy was casing the same bank and saw the whole thing. Buddy says, I'll take the thousand, but we're leaving in
Till they got busted.
Till they got busted.
That wasn't Jack's fault. No, that was on account of Buddy, for some reason, decided to call his sister and confess to a job <u>before</u> they'd done it instead of after. She called the FBI and they both went down, ended up at Lompoc. I think Buddy felt kinda bad about that.

Ask him his name.
Who are you?
You're good.
Thank you.
Adele? You in there?
Yes.
I talk to the guy you work for, Emil. He tole me your number and where you live. See, I'm looking for an assistant and would like to speak to you.

Wait in the hall! I have to get dressed!
Tell me where is Jack Foley, I don't bother you no more.

Why you want to do that, to a frien'?
It's Richard Ripley.
The Wall Street guy? Oh, yeah. I didn't recognize him without his rug.
I bet that's all the hacks they send out. Otherwise nobody's left to mind the store.
Why don't we talk about it later?
Where in the hell are we?
That's the turnpike up there. Glenn's waiting with the other car.
That's the turnpike up there. Glenn's waiting with the other car.
Okay, honey, come on out of there.
We may as well leave her, we're leaving the car and we gotta leave her some place anyway, what's the difference where?
She's coming with us.
Jesus Christ, what were you doing in there?
Get the shotgun. And her purse. I'd like to know who she is.
Do we need him?
The green-and-whites saw us. One of 'em starts thinking, what's that car doing there? Ties it to the break and turns around...
Wait a minute. Let me have your raincoat. Somebody forgot to bring me clean clothes.
I brought 'em, they're back at Glades in the Cadillac. You wanted to take her car.
Why you brought Glenn into this, I'll never know.
How 'bout the score was his idea to begin with?
How 'bout the score was his idea to begin with?
His idea? Gimme a break. Fuckin' guy's got a vacant lot for a head. Was you and me figured the whole thing out.
I don't know why, but every time he opens his mouth I want to punch him out.
He ain't the problem, Jack.
You want to take her to my place and get cleaned up? You come out of the bathroom with your after-shave on and she goes, "Oh, I had you all wrong"?
I want to talk to her again, that's all. See what would happen under, you know, normal circumstances.
I want to talk to her again, that's all. See what would happen under, you know, normal circumstances.
You're too late, Jack.
I'm just saying she wasn't scared.
Cause she had her hand on her gun the whole time, waiting to make her move.
You're just jealous it was me in the trunk with her and not you.
You're right.
I've been dreaming about a hot bath for the last six months. Soak the prison off me.
There's some lilac oil, you want some, a vanilla candle under the sink.

Yeah, but what happened after she drove off with Glenn?
Yeah, but what happened after she drove off with Glenn?
You'll have to ask Glenn. And most likely, he's on his way to Detroit, where we should be.
Think this old guy is her boyfriend? It's the only picture she carries.
Am I going to Detroit by myself?
Longer we hang around down here, Jack, better chance there is either Glenn's gonna fuck up the whole score, or we gonna get busted, or both.
We'll leave first thing in the morning.
What?!
You better come see this.
Chino's gonna wanna talk to me.
He's running for his life, he doesn't give a shit about you.
He's running for his life, he doesn't give a shit about you.

He knows where she lives?
Jack?
We were talking one time, drinking rum. I may've mentioned Adele, how she worked for a magician. Chino got interested. He's like, Yeah? How does he saw the woman in half? He wanted to meet her. Or get a look at her if she ever came to visit.

Sure looks that way.

Let's go to Detroit.

Now you're talkin'.

He isn't fighting no more. Glenn told me the Snoop's been managing some guys up there now, works out at the Kronk.
They know where I live, I guess they know what I drive, so maybe we should pick up another car on the way.
She just sat there, looking right at me.
"Fight over tuna casserole may have spurred slaying." Seems this woman's live-in boyfriend, seventy years old, complained about her tuna noodle casserole and she shot him in the face with a twelve-gauge. Police found noodles in the woman's hair and think the guy dumped the casserole dish on her before she shot him. They'd been together ten years.
Love is funny.
Whatta you think?
I think Glenn opened his big mouth and now we got us another partner.

You want, I tole you you can come. You all right, Foley. I like you.
You told me I can come 'cause I caught you digging the fuckin' tunnel, saw you and Lulu coming out of the bushes, thought maybe you two were making out.
You see what they doing, those posts out there? Putting up another fence, five metres on the other side of the one that's there. We wait until Super Bowl Sunday, they could have the second fence built and we have to dig another nine, ten days. So we going soon as it's dark. You want -- I mean it -- you can still come.

He killed a police officer.

You believe that?

Why not?
What were you gonna do with me?

I was just thinking that I could use a guy like you, someone knows how to ask for things the right way. I'm talkin' about when you're outta here. I mean, you can't rob banks for ever.
It's a little late for me.

How, Dick? The way <u>you</u> earned it? By marrying some rich broad owns the company, selling it off a piece at a time, then divorcing her?

I can't believe you're still angry with me, Jack, after all this time.
I'm not angry, Richard. In fact, I'm completely relaxed. Thing is, I can't tell if it's the fish that're cooling me out or all those uncut diamonds on the bottom of the tank there.

You'd meet doctors, lawyers -- nothing wrong with them necessarily if they're divorced. Why settle for some cowboy cop who drinks too much and cheats on his wife? That's the way those hotshots are, all of 'em.

I see that.
Was it Foley?
Off a tip?
Hello? Yeah, she is. Just a minute. For you.
Hello?
Remember, pay attention to how she talks about Foley, her tone. Do it right, she'll tell you things she wouldn't tell Burdon. Tell her you think he's a nice guy. No, first tell her about being in the trunk with him, in the dark for half an hour, and see how she takes it. If she's in on it, what does she get for
He's pretty laid back, confident.

You like the wild ones, don't you? Tillman, Nicolet and now Foley. You know, I've always said there's a thin line between the cowboy cops and the armed robbers, all those guys that love to pack.

Foley <i>kid</i>napped me.
Yeah, but you talked all the way from GCI to the turnpike. It sounds more like a first date than a kidnapping.
He waved to you?
I couldn't swear to it, but I'm pretty sure he did.

Buddy's sister Regina Mary Bragg got two calls from Buddy up in Detroit this morning, called Burdon. She's also the one gave Burdon Buddy's address.
So?

So what I want to know is why Buddy still calls his sister every week even after she turned him in.

None I'd like to share.
You gonna go get him?
It's possible. Why?
It's possible. Why?
I was just thinking... you could have a nice time with him on the plane -- like picking up where your interlude, or whatever you call it, left off. And then throw him in the can.

That's right, just me.
Where's Ripley's safe at, he keep his valuables in.
I don't have any idea.
I don't have any idea.
Let's go upstairs, have a look at the man's bedroom. All right now, you and Mr. Buddy check the rooms down here. Look at the wall behind any pictures hanging on it. Look at the walls in the closets. The man has a safe, it's gonna be up there somewhere.
How do I look, mama?
Like a fag.
A'ight, this time we gotta get the motherfuckin' trajectory right... Okay, on three: One... Two...
The combination is three-ten-forty-four.
I've heard a lot about you, Mr. Sisco.
Likewise.
In case no one knows what he does. Tell me, Ray, you ever wear one says, "Undercover"?
No. Course not.
Yeah, someone spotted two of 'em in this hobo camp out by the airport, called the number--
I knew it, soon as I saw they were offering a reward.
Did you pay the guy the reward?
Yeah, as soon as we got back.
...She fixes him pork chops and rice, the next thing you know they're making love on the sofa. She says he was very gentle.
I spoke to her. The guy told her he missed his little girl and she felt sorry for him.
I spoke to her. The guy told her he missed his little girl and she felt sorry for him.
That's how you score now?
The woman also said he stole her husband's gun, a twenty-two pistol, and some of his clothes.
So the woman's married. She goes to bed with this prison escapee because he misses his little girl and then tells the world about it. But you don't reveal her name, you protect her. It sounds like you're saying it's okay as long as her husband doesn't find out about it. Like the guy who cheats on his wife, saying what she doesn't know
Thank you...

No, numbnuts, die. You get your nurse alone, you look her in the eye, and say, "Baby, they're training me for war, and I don't know what'll happen. But if I die tomorrow, I wanna know that we lived all we could tonight." I've never known it to fail.

Fuck you.
She loves you. I know that. And part of what she loves in me is how much of you she sees in me.
She said I was so much like you. I said, No, I'm not. I'm like I am because of you, but I'm not you, not as good as you. Everybody else saw me as a loser with a big chip on his shoulder. But you saw the better part of me, the part of me that could be like you, and changed me. You
How sweet. Is that when you put the move on her?
Get me into a plane!
Come on!
Where are we going?
Auxiliary field at Haleiwa, ten miles north of here.
Auxiliary field at Haleiwa, ten miles north of here.
What's there?
What's there?
Six P-40's.
This ain't a little feud, Earl, it's World War Two!
They're coming around for another pass. You got extra weapons and ammo?
It's tight.
Tighter 'n a bulls ass in fly season. Don't hit the barn.
They're all over us!
Bet they don't dust crops in Japan.
You hear my okay?
Yeah. So you can call me if you need help.
Yeah. So you can call me if you need help.
I got a half a tank. You?
I got a half a tank. You?
Little less.
Land of the free.
Home of the brave.
I'm out of ammo!
I'm out of fuel!
Sorry you're gonna die -- cause I'm gonna make it.
What color flowers you want me to bring to your funeral?
Fun today. Like old times.
Danny, what the hell are you trying to do out there?
Danny, what the hell are you trying to do out there?
What do you mean? I'm just doing what we've always done.
What do you mean? I'm just doing what we've always done.
No. You're trying to beat me.
No. You're trying to beat me.
We've always tried to beat each other.
We've always tried to beat each other.
Bullshit. We've played with each other, pushed each other. This is different. Like you want to prove that you're better than me. Who's that for -- Evelyn?
Maybe just trying to measure up.
What's between you and her is between you and her. But here's what's between you and me. Everybody has a hero, Danny. And you're mine.
It's shorter than our practice runway.
They'll turn the ship into the wind before we launch. That'll help.
They'll turn the ship into the wind before we launch. That'll help.
We'll be loaded with 2,000 pounds of bombs and 1,500 pounds of fuel. I got another Chinese phrase for Doolittle. "Mug wump rickshaw mushu pork." It means "Who the fuck thought up this shit?"
It's not getting any longer.
Longer? It's getting shorter.
Broomsticks instead of tail guns.
We'll get separated over the target, but you and I will rendezvous for the run to China. I'm on your wing.

Danny...
I can't make it.
I can't make it.
Yes you can.
Hey! What is this, the planes all bunched up like that?
The brass is afraid of sabotage. This makes 'em easier to protect -- and easier to service.

Yeah.
Yeah.
We got a saying here. A-low-HA!
Lieutenant... I'm Danny Walker. I'm Rafe McCawley's best friend.
Were. Isn't that what you mean? Were. Because he's dead, isn't he? And that's why you've come.
Before Rafe left, he asked me to be the one to tell you, if it happened.
He told me about you. That he had no other friend like you.
He told me about you. That he had no other friend like you.
Rafe's folks had a crop dusting business, owned their own planes. Real straight, frugal. My father was the town drunk. Went to sleep one night on the railroad tracks and was still there when the Dawn Express came along. Rafe and I were the only ones at the funeral. He took me back to his house, and I never left.

How's everything?
We got some soldiers in traction from a jeep accident, but it's quiet. Except for the occasional fighter plane buzzing us.

That might not have been such a good idea. They're making us fly out of a half-paved airfield. The real punishment is that I won't be back to the barracks till it's too late for dinner or coffee. So I guess it's goodbye for awhile.

I was just thinking that war is a series of goodbyes. Do you think that's why we're meeting. To help us say goodbye to Rafe?

I swore not to talk about him tonight, but there's all this stuff I think I ought to tell you, that he didn't get a chance to. Rafe was...he was lonely. He had such high expectations of himself that he always felt empty. The week he met you he told me he felt his heart had always lived in winter, and for the first
Sorry.
He told me he didn't want to leave me with regret. Now that's all I have.

Hey, have you seen Pearl Harbor at night?

Well...sure.
Well...sure.
From the air?
So beautiful!
Hang on.
And where's the secret base, Sir? The one we t-takeoff from.
The navy will get us to within 400 miles of the Japanese coast. We'll launch off the carriers from there.
C-Colonel, we been p-practicing takeoff's, but I ain't sure we can land on these carriers d-decks.
We won't have the fuel to get back to the carriers; they'll turn and run back to Hawaii the minute we're airborne.

I have a phrase I want you all to memorize: "Lushu hoo megwa fugi." It means "I am an American." In Chinese.
Now we have fifteen requests for the Emperor's Palace...and one for Tokyo baseball stadium.
I d-don't think Japs ought'a be allowed to p-play baseball.
I d-don't think Japs ought'a be allowed to p-play baseball.
I'd like to bomb their Emperor too. But I think that'd just piss 'em off. The idea here, Gentlemen, is not revenge. We're here to prove to them that they're neither invincible nor superior. So let's try this again. Military targets only.

There are some people who think the outside loop is reckless and irresponsible.
How could it be irresponsible, Sir, if you were the first man in the world to do it?

Don't get smart with me, son.
Don't get smart with me, son.
Never, Sir. I just meant it's dangerous only for the kind of pilot who wants to show off, rather than inspire the other pilots in his unit. And all you've done for me, Sir, working out the transfer, I did it to say thanks. To honor you, Sir. What the French call a "homage."

Good luck over there McCawley. I admire your decision.
Thank you, Sir.
I heard what you did.
We can explain, Colonel.

Explain what?
Is that the good new, Sir, or --
You're just about the only pilots in the Army with actual combat experience, so you're volunteering for a mission I've been ordered to put together. Do you know what top secret is?

Well sure, Colonel --
Well sure, Colonel --
Top secret means you help me pick the other pilots, train, and go -- without knowing where you're going until it's too late.
In flight school you qualified in single and in multi-engine planes. You'll be flying multi-engines here.
Bombers.
Bombers.
I want to introduce a couple of people. Doc White is a flight surgeon; he has volunteered for gunnery training so that he can go on the mission, because we can't spare the weight of an extra man.
I thought I'd made it clear, I'm not just putting this mission together -- I'm leading it myself.
I take it back, about the flowers. We're all gonna die.
Listen you guys. I'm the first plane -- then McCawley, Walker, the rest of you. I'll have the shortest run. If I don't make it, you don't go.
Colonel...we're all going. Whether you make it or not.
Colonel...we're all going. Whether you make it or not.
I know.
'Scuse me, 'Mam. All the ship's doctors is golfing, and I couldn't find nobody to look at this.
Our doctor's gone too.

Sorry to trouble you.

Wait, let me look at that... You better come in here.
How'd you get this?
Boxin'.

Yes'm.
What's your name?
Dorie Miller, 'Mam.
Dorie Miller, 'Mam.
I'm Evelyn. And I'm just a nurse. But I'm not playing golf, and that cut needs sewing, or else it's gonna make a big lumpy scar. Whatta ya say?
How often you fight like this?
Every other Sunday. I'm heavyweight champion of the West Virginia.

What do you get for winning?
What do you get for winning?
Respect.
Thank you, 'Mam.
Tell me something, Dorie. A man as big as you -- and smart too, you knew where to come when your ship couldn't help -- do you still have to fight with your fists to get respect?

I left my Mama and joined the Navy to be a man. They made me a cook -- and not even that, really -- I clean up after the other sailors eat. I shine the officer's shoes. In two years, they've never even let me fire a gun.
You take care, Dorie.
You too, 'Mam.
Hello, Lieutenant. Good to see you.
You too, Lieutenant.
Oh, this is Betty.
Nice to meet you, Betty.
Danny's not coming?
No, he...got some news today. He'll be okay, he just didn't feel like coming tonight.
No, he...got some news today. He'll be okay, he just didn't feel like coming tonight.
I was hoping to meet him.
Whatever you're trying to tell me isn't good, is it. Or it wouldn't be so hard to say.
The only reason it's hard to say is that I keep thinking I don't have the right to say it. But I've got to because it's true. I love you. That must surprise you.

It surprises me that I'm not the only one on this balcony who feels that way.
There's one thing I have to say. I'm going away.
We're all going away.
We're all going away.
I'm going to the war. The real war. Hitler's taken Europe. The Brits are hanging on by their fingernails, and If they lose, there'll be more people killed than anybody can imagine. And not just there, but here.

You waited til tonight to tell me?
You waited til tonight to tell me?
I had to tell you in person. Because there's something else I need to say.
Evelyn...you know the line -- let's make tonight memorable. What I feel about you makes it impossible for me to say something like that. If I don't come back, I don't want to saddle you with regret and sadness you'll carry the rest of your life.
I don't know if you can choose that, Rafe.
I don't know if you can choose that, Rafe.
Maybe not. But I need you to know. I love you. And I will come back. I'll find a way. And then we'll get a chance to know if what I felt the first moment I saw you, and every minute since then, is real.

Do one thing for me, before you go.
I sent telegrams, I guess the military traffic held them up.
Why were you sitting here, instead of...
Why were you sitting here, instead of...
I saw you, I couldn't go in, I...just stood there wondering if you knew. You looked...sad, and I had to sit down a minute.

How did you?...
How did you?...
...Survive? I jumped in a patch of fog, and nobody could see me. I hit the water hard. And it was so...cold.
I called my folks, then Colonel Doolittle. The Colonel sent a man to pick me up. They wanted to debrief me. I told the Colonel I needed to see somebody first, and he had a supply flight heading out in an hour. I've done a lot of talking. You haven't said anything.
I'm just...so amazed, so glad to know that you're okay. You are okay, aren't you?
I'm just...so amazed, so glad to know that you're okay. You are okay, aren't you?
Nothing that won't heal. I guess.
It's been...so different, being so sure you were dead.
I'm so sorry for what you must've gone through, but I'm back.
It's all right. Danny always said I see things with my emotions instead of my eyes.
It's not your fault, Rafe. The letter I wrote you, they --
It's not your fault, Rafe. The letter I wrote you, they --
Don't worry about that. Guys away from home, lonely, good-hearted women try to cheer them up.
Don't worry about that. Guys away from home, lonely, good-hearted women try to cheer them up.
It's not that I didn't mean everything I wrote. It's just that -- I thought you were dead. And now --
What else can we do?
There's nothing you can do here, they'll die or they won't, we just --
Rafe --
I need to tell you something. I didn't know what it was to lose somebody, to see death and find how much it scares you. That you haven't lived and loved enough. I didn't understand. Forgive me.

Rafe... No. You forgive me.

Of course I forgive you. I know what you feel for Danny is real. And your choice is your choice.
Of course I forgive you. I know what you feel for Danny is real. And your choice is your choice.
That's what I have to tell you, Rafe. It wasn't a choice. It --
What?...
They were bringing back a ship full of wounded and needed extra nurses along. I wrote Colonel Doolittle, and told him I needed to see you before you go.

It must of been a convincing letter.

It was. I couldn't have you go away, wherever it is...to war...without knowing something. You think I made a choice, of Danny over you. I didn't. I didn't have a choice. I'm pregnant.
Uncharged torpedoes have different balance.
I have arranged a live fire drill -- with your permission.
Everything real except the fact that no one is shooting back at us.
If we achieve surprise, they will offer little resistance.

Set up teams of radio operators to send out messages the Americans will intercept, concerning every potential American target in the Pacific. Include Hawaii -- the clutter will be more confusing that way.

Brilliant, Admiral.
Brilliant, Admiral.
A brilliant man would find a way not to fight a war.
We have achieved surprise, but their carriers are not in port. I don't like this.
We have a fighter screen up, in case we are attacked, Admiral.
We have a fighter screen up, in case we are attacked, Admiral.
We must go ahead. This is our moment.
We have achieved complete surprise! The first wave is returning, the second is attacking now, and we have lost only a few planes. We can launch a third wave, Admiral.
The second wave has not returned. And we have no idea where their carriers are. What is the damage report?
If we launch the third wave and annihilate their fuel depots, we destroy their ability to operate in the Pacific for at least a year!
And if we fail, and lose our carriers, we destroy our ability to fight them at all. As soon as the second wave returns, we will withdraw.
What if the Japanese did invade?
We've done studies. We're confident we would turn them back eventually...after they'd gotten as far as Chicago.
We have bombed Tokyo, Mr. President. Radio Tokyo interrupted it's own broadcast to make the announcement.
Have the planes made it to China?
Have the planes made it to China?
There've been some complications, Sir. The Chinese didn't receive our request for homing beacons until is was too late to get them set. And the planes had to take off so early they may lack fuel to make the mainland anyway.

So you join us, Admiral. Some of us thought your education at an American university would make you too weak to fight the Americans.
If knowledge of opponents and careful calculation of danger is taken as weakness then I have misunderstood what it means to be Japanese.

The time has come to strike! Or to sit and let the Americans cut off our oil and our future. I know what you whisper to the others, Yamamoto -- that the Americans are strong. Yet look at their leader.
You have something to say, Yamamoto?
The Council knows I have opposed fighting the Americans. No matter how great our resolve, they have resources beyond ours. If we must go to war, there is only one way -- deal them a blow from which it will take them years to recover. In that time we can conquer all of the Pacific, and they will have no choice but to ask

The Americans themselves have made it possible. We will annihilate them in a single attack -- at Pearl Harbor.
Hello, Lilla!
Peggy Sue!
Quite a bit more rain than usual this year. I hope it doesn't spoil the rhubarb.
I've already got some in. I was thinking of making a pie for dinner tonight. How would you like that?
What's it going to be, Elizabeth? Seventyfive? Eighty?
I'm not telling.
I'm not telling.
I've been trying to drag it out of her for years. You know, dreams are fascinating business. 'Specially where you see the future.
What's Peggy Sue going to do at your lodge meeting?
It's her 18th birthday, I want to show her off.
Do you believe in all of that?
Well, I like to speculate. This book I'm reading right now, a woman in Colorado says she lived in Ireland a hundred and fifty years ago. Her name was Bridey Murphy- and she gives names and dates and where she lived. She was hypnotized. Big bestseller.

I remember that book! Grandpa, Grandma, I want to tell you something.
It's gonna rain again. Every time I wash the car, it rains.
That never changes. You know, when you and Grandma are gone, the family's gone. I never see the cousins anymore.

Let's go.
Goodbye, Grandma.
What does Grandma think you do at your meetings?
Stag movies. Smokers.
I may be an old fool, but I think we can help you.
I hope so. At least I got to see you and Grandma. Has it ever worked before?

The last one was six hundred years ago. It's about time for another one.
Do you have to wear that hat?
It wouldn't be a lodge without hats.
Where were you? You said you'd be back at twelve.
This is my old friend Carol.. I told you about her.
r was worried about you You didn't even call. You're always on my case if I don't call..
How do you like my hair?
How do you like my hair?
It looks great. Don't change the subject. You know how busy Saturdays are. And I can't do the icing. I always mess up the roses. You're not being very responsible.
But I want you and Scott to understand. Do you think he loves Janet? Maybe he's smashed too many fortune cookies.
Come on Mom. Give him a break. He's missing the reunion because of you. You know he wants to go.
Come on Mom. Give him a break. He's missing the reunion because of you. You know he wants to go.
Then we'd both have a miserable time. What do you think?
Hey, you're a hip chick. You look like you stepped right out of Life magazine. Any time you want to borrow it again, just ask.
Borrow?! This was my dress. Maybe it's a mistake. What if I'm the only one? I don't even want to go. Everybody's just going to say... Hi.. Where's Crazy Charlie?

Why are you so nervous? What is the matter with you today?
Why are you so nervous? What is the matter with you today?
I don't know. Reunions do funny things to people.
Carol!
Peggy Sue!
1 just did it for the reunion. I thought it would be fun.
You're probably the only one who could carry it off.
Welcome to the singles scene.
I don't know how you do it. I've never even dated anybody but Charlie.

You should have left here years ago, like I did.
It's not the place. I don't buy that. Trapped in the same town forever. The price she would pay for her teenage lust.

Oh, it's not so bad. I have two wonderful kids, my own business. Still, knowing what I know now, if I had the chance to do it all over again, I'd sure do things a lot differently.

Maddy, what did you do to your hair?
We're going to take you home.
That's okay. I'm sure I'll remember the way.
I'll call you Later.
Yes. Let's stay in touch.
I don't get it.
That's because you' re not a total moron like they are.
He is kind of cute, isn't he?
Yeah. You're so lucky. He really loves you, too. He's always telling Walter how wonderful you are.
Yeah. You're so lucky. He really loves you, too. He's always telling Walter how wonderful you are.

Come on. What's with you and Michael?
I bet Dolores told Charlie.
That loudmouthed little bitch~
Okay. But let's have a girls night soon. Maybe a pajama party.
Aren't we a little old for that?

It's that jerk Walter.

Lucky lady. Hi.
Michael Fitzsimmons! Is he here?
Can you believe I want to marry that dork.
Why do guys do such stupid things?
Charlie really has a great voice.
Maybe they'll be the next Dion and the Belmonts.
I hear she does more than talk with her mouth.
That's disgusting!
That's disgusting!

You better watch out for her. She's after Charlie.

But you love me don't you?
Yeah. Come on Charlie, turn it off.
Yeah. Come on Charlie, turn it off.

Jesus, Peggy. Take it easy. I'm not used to that stuff. You always did the bills. Blame the damn post office.
You got a Tab?
I don't buy them anymore. You were the only one who drank them.
You don't want them? They're going to make a big comeback any minute. Mark my words, these lamps are going to...
I know. Put Scott through college.

I'll think of a way to sell, them. One day.
Are you taking Janet to the reunion tonight?
I'm not going.
I vant to suck your blood. I also vant to suck your Twinkie.
Charlie! Am I dead?
Charlie! Am I dead?
No. You are the undead. You will live forever if you give me your Twinkie. Come on, let's have it. You hate them anyway.
How do you feel?
Pretty strange.
Not now, Charlie. I've got a headache. Get used to the word. Roll it around your tongue for a years.
Hey, I can take a hint. You look great today.
You drive like a maniac!

I can understand that.. But please don't start crying again.
It's not going to be forever. I figure three years is long enough. I can see it the music pans out. And right after graduation we should start seeing other people. Kind of comparison shop before we settle down and get married. Know what I mean?
Why wait?

Well, we got the prom coming up, all these parties. We shouldn't upset our parents?

Want me to drive you home later?
Would you?
Would you?
Would I?!! Why I oughta...
Looking good out there.
Thanks.

I noticed you were giving me the silent treatment at lunch. I guess I deserved it. I've been thinking about my three year plan and I think it's unworkable. I must have been delirious.

You're pretty charming when you want to be.

Yeah I know. But I don't have to flatter you. It just feels right. You're the perfect girl for me. As in is, was and always will be. I'm glad dancing was invented. You know the first dances were rituals. Like fertility rites.
Mmm. This is nice. I always loved the way you kiss. I missed you.
Your eyes look like silver pools of moonlight. And the tide rushes in.

Yeah, I know. Girls mature faster than guys. But last night, I was the one who put on the brakes. And you know why?
Why?
Because nothing else matters. That's the great thing about love. Every time we argue, every time something goes wrong, and I know that I'm not perfect either, things just work out better in the end. Cause you're my baby and I love you.
What am I going to do with you?
What am I going to do with you?
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true.
Charlie. I just had the strangest dream.
I have to talk to you..
What are you doing here?
Let's go down to the basement.
I want to know what's going on. Dolores told me that you and that scuzzball Michael Fitzsimmons...

Then it's true, dammit! I had a miserable time tonight 'cause of you. When the Monotones did "Book of Love  Chapter Four you break up, won't you give it just one more chance..." I'm thinking Did we break up? 'Cause if we did, I don't even know about it!. I thought we cleared all that up yesterday. Did that Maynard G. Beatnik give

Why are you trying to kill the two things that mean the most to me? Until yesterday you loved me and you loved us. ) What the hell has changed? For two years I've done nothing

Stop being defensive. I want to help you. I wrote a song for you.
Stop being defensive. I want to help you. I wrote a song for you.
You're kidding. You wrote a song? Is it about a guilty girl and a trusting guy... she wants to hurt him, and he wonders why?
Not exactly, but with your great voice, it'll be a huge hit. Honest.

Just take a look at it.
Just take a look at it.
If you took the trouble to write it, then sure, I'll take a look at it. But I'm beginning to think that maybe there's more to life than music. I wonder if people would still like me if I stopped being Mr. Excitement?
Does this mean you like me again?
It means I care about you and what happens to you.
It means I care about you and what happens to you.
That's all I wanted to hear. 'Cause I'm never going to give up on us. It's easy to fall apart in a crisis. It's easy to be selfish and say goodbye and good luck. But this is more than love. This is a mental decision. Just wait till tomorrow, when you see your birthday present. Then you'll understand.
Forget it, it'll never work.
Okay. Listen, I cancelled the tickets for Fabian. I thought it would be better for your birthday to eat at a nice restaurant, Chez Tres.

Right here. Now sit down.
Look. I wanna tell you. I forgive you for everything. I know what you've been going through. You're just scared. I was scared, too, but I'm not anymore.
How could you possibly know what I've been going through?
What do you mean you and my father decided? Who the hell are you to plan my life? Let's get married and live happily ever after. Bullshit. I got knocked up. I had to marry you. I never had a choice.
What?
What?
You betrayed me, Charlie. You were never there for me or the children. And now you come and tell me, "Peggy, you're scared." Of course I'm scared. If you knew what I knew you'd be scared shitless.

I might be crazy, but I'm not crazy enough to marry you twice. There's a lot of things I can't change. I can't even think about them. I tried. But I couldn't even help Rosalie. I don't want to be bitter. I'm a naturally optimistic person. But you took advantage of that.
Will you take me back to my grandparents?
Of course.
Oh, Charlie.
It opens, too. Look inside.
I love you.
I know.
I think we should get out of here. It's going to rain.

That's over. I got tired of translating everything. She thought the Big Hopper was a hamburger.
It couldn't be me. I hardly knew him.
I'll just set it right here.
Charlie, I had a strange experience. I went back to high school. And I spent a lot of time with you. And you and Walter and Leon were singing "I Wonder Why".
Oh, God, Dion.

Fine, thanks. Come on in. I want to talk to you.
Yes, sir.
She seems confused, irresponsible, overemotional. My wife says that's the way girls act sometimes.
Yes, sir. But that's what I like about her. She's not like all the other girls at school.
Charles, in spite of your adolescent infatuation with music, we've always regarded you a a fine young man. We've trusted you with our daughter.
Charles, in spite of your adolescent infatuation with music, we've always regarded you a a fine young man. We've trusted you with our daughter.
Yes, sir. Trust is a twoway street. In the past two years I've been pleased to note that you and Mrs. Kelcher have, uh, fulfilled your sacred trust of being good parents to the, uh, woman I plan to take off your hands.
We think this party might cheer her up. Just make sure you know what's expected of you.
What would that be, sir?
What would that be, sir?
Show her a good time, but for God's sake restrain yourself.
Show her a good time, but for God's sake restrain yourself.
Of course.
Did you study for the test?

Carol and I saw you with that creep, Richard, today.
First of all, Richard is not a creep. He happens to be an exceptional person. If any of you gave him half a chance, you'd find that out.

Fine. ) Grandma, would you teach me how to make strudel?
That's a day's work. But if that's what you want, maybe we can do it tomorrow for your birthday.
You know, Peggy Sue, your mother said you had a dream that I died.
I wish she hadn't.
I wish she hadn't.
I'm not afraid. I know exactly when I'm going to die.
If you believe it, darling, then I believe. Being young can be just as confusing as being old. The things that happened to me fifty years ago are more on my mind than what happened yesterday.
But I'm remembering the future.

My children make me happy. I miss them so much. Beth. Scott and Beth. I'm going to name my daughter after you.
It was my idea, Grandma. I always wondered what went on at those lodge meetings.
He won't tell me, but I've got my suspicions. And I don't want any of that. Don't keep her out late.
It was Beth's idea.
I wish I had the nerve. And the figure.
Beth's boyfriend is playing in the band.
It must run in the family.
Don't get your hopes up.
Come on, where's your enthusiasm?
How come we're your best friends and we had to find out about you and Michael Fitzsimmons from Dolores?
She's unbelievable. Who needs satellites when we've got Dolores's mouth?
Yeah. He's so cool and mysterious.
He's very interesting. For all his pretending to be a tough guy, he's really got the soul of a poet.
Cool it kids. He's free to see other girls, if he wants.
But I always thought that you would marry Charlie, Carol would marry Walter, and I would marry Arthur. We'd all live on the same street and take our kids to the park together and have barbecues every Sunday. It'll spoil everything if you and Charlie break up. That Michael doesn't look like the barbecue type.

I'd love to.

Okay. Here's a new one. It's called Tenderness. I couldn't sleep so I thought I'd scream Betrayed by a kiss, sucking pods of bitterness. In the madhouse of Dr. Dread Razor shreds of rat puke fall On my bare arms I'm sorry. I guess I was trying to impress you.
That was quite an evening. Bourgeois, phony, decadent, stupid.
I shouldn't have put you through that. It must have been agony. Let's do something.
Five more weeks of school. And ten minutes past graduation I'm gone. To freedom.
For everyone.

Rita. I met her last summer. She's cool. You'll really dig her. She's got this great little cabin in the hills, just outside of Provo where she raises chickens. I'll write and the two of you can take care of the chickens to support us.

I can dig that. Bittersweet perfection. Dogs of lust on leashes of memory... yeah.
It's Charlie!
What a treat.
Ssh. He's great.
Peggy Sue's still stuck on treble without a cause.
I thought I knew everything about him.
Can we split now?
I can dig you being uptight about Rita and Utah. That's cool. But I've got to warn you about something.
What?
What?
My father. He's not just the ultimate square. He's a total crook.
Young lady, you're drunk!
Just a little. I've had a tough day.

Dad, I never knew you had a sense of humor.
Evelyn, put her to bed.
Thank you.. I accept your apology with the hope that what went on yesterday will never happen again.
That would be impossible.

Oh boy, that's another thing that's going to change. Who's going to think for us? Our husbands? You know, you treat Mom like a maid. It's not entirely your fault. Those were the attitudes in the fifties, and that's the way you raised me. But give Nancy a break, encourage her to go to art school.

Ta da! Pantyhose! The death of the garter belt! Of course, once they're manufactured they'll look better than this. What do you think?
This is your great invention? Would you wear those things?
That's all well and good, but we don't have the money to manufacture them.
You need a partner. There's a friend of mine at school whose father makes seat covers for cars, Mr. Fitzsimmons. I've invited him and his family over for dinner tomorrow night.
You mean to tell me that you invited this Mr. Fitzsimmons over to talk about investing his money in your cockamamie idea?
Wrong, Dad. Your idea.
How did it go with the pantyhose?
It's the darndest thing. Ed knew what they were immediately. As a matter of fact, he said he's got a product like that in development right now.

Oh, you're both so naive.
Look young lady, I grew up through the depression. I fought in the second World War. Six days a week I get up and deal with the public, the bank and the bill collectors. And on the seventh day, when God rests, I don't have to listen to my daughter calling me a fool!
Jack, take it easy. She gave blood at school today. Maybe she's just a little lightheaded.
This is not giving blood. This is drunk.
A new car. We can't afford a new car.
Don't worry, it's just a seasonal slump.

You have four seasons, you have four slumps.
I don't need your charity. I don't need your grandmother's jewelry or your parents money -how could you do that?
Please don't shout.
Does everybody have to hear?
I want everybody to hear because I don't have anything to be ashamed of.
Jack, I was just trying to help.
We'll make it, we'll be fine.
Peggy Sue, watch your mouth.
Mr. Fitzsimmons is a very prominent man.
Mom!
The nurse called and said you'd be coming home.
I have a note.
How do you feel?

I'm excused.

Why don't you go lie down for a while.

My little baby. Don't try to grow up so fast.
Oh Mom, I forgot you were ever so young.
What happened to your hair? You have such a pretty face. Why are you always trying to cover it up?
Oh. I forgot.
You're looking pretty chipper this morning.
I'm still here, aren't I? I may as well enjoy myself. I'm going to go to school today. Dad, I want to apologize for yesterday. The car is a classic. Use it in the best of health.
When did you start drinking coffee?
Oh. Ah...recently. All the kids drink it.
Oh yeah. Charlie. How am I going to handle him?
What's the matter? Did you two have a fight?.

The house payments.
Who was that man?
It was nobody. Ah... he's a poll, taker. I'm thinking of voting Democrat this year. But don't mention it to your father. How was school today?
It was nobody. Ah... he's a poll, taker. I'm thinking of voting Democrat this year. But don't mention it to your father. How was school today?
It was great to see everybody again. But it's so boring and regimented. Most of what they teach is useless. The worst thing was lunch.
Would you get that, dear?
Sure, Mom. Hello.
Peggy! What's the matter? Who is it?
It's Grandma. I can't talk to her now. I'm sorry, Grandma.
What happened to you?
I had a dream that Grandma died.

That's a good girl... I hate to see you so upset. Tell me, sweetheart. Are you having problems with Charlie? You mentioned something this morning.
I'm confused about a lot of things right now. Charlie's only one of them.
Is Charlie pressuring you to do things you don't think you should be doing?
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
Peggy, do you know what a penis is? Stay away from it.
Charlie's downstairs. Why aren't you ready?
For what?
For what?
Maddy's party.

I don't feel very festive.

You accepted an invitation, Maddy's one of your best friends, and I baked the Rice Krispie squares.
Where have you been?
I went for a drive. Up in the hills.
I'm not the maid!
Way to go, Mom!
Would they go over my girdle or under?
Instead of a girdle. And light as a feather.
Isn't that awfully forward?
We've got to move fast. This is an idea whose time has come.
You know, dear, I think the pantyhose is a wonderful idea, but the next time you come up with something, please don't stay out all night. Just tell us. We'll believe you.
Mom, how about a machine that's like your blender, only it slices vegetables, kneads dough, chops meat and even make fresh pasta?
No, just a friend of mine. I don't think he Likes JellO.
What does Charlie think about that?

You know Mom, it's okay to have male friends. Besides, it's over with me and Charlie.

Sheerotards. Catchy name, isn't it? Like leotards.

You think this'll cheer Dad up?
Of course, he'll love it. You're a terrific artist.

For God's sake, forget the money! I'm going crazy! I'm a walking anachronism. I'm a puddle of deja I'm worried about my kids, Scott must be scared to death, I think my daughter's doing drugs again. I can't have any fun here, I don't have that innocence any more. I can't keep all this in anymore. I feel Like I'm going to explode.

Everything. This is perfect. The subconscious mind remembers all. You can give me more information on microchips and then pinpoint what happened at the reunion. Maybe that'll give us a clue on how to get you back.

No. The Pill will change all that. Then he wouldn't have blamed me. We were just too young.

Wait! I'll go with you!
Wait! I'll go with you!
You can't. You're going to be Valedictorian.
Why are you bothering me about this? Can't you leave it be?
I... um...
...the pathologist... he said that you had reported a similar incident... with a cat...
The Creed cat, that's right. Bastard's name was "Church". Let me guess. Your dog's tissue isn't healing, pupils aren't dilating... maybe you can't find a heartbeat?
The Creed cat, that's right. Bastard's name was "Church". Let me guess. Your dog's tissue isn't healing, pupils aren't dilating... maybe you can't find a heartbeat?
Exactly! I thought it might be some sort of blood condition... immune deficiency or...
You want some advice, friend? You get in your car, you pick up your family... and you get the hell out of that town.
Well... uh... thanks...
Believe what you saw, Matthews. The dog was dead.
My God... ...how is that possible? You have to help me, Doctor Yolander. I don't know what I'm dealing with here! They've dug up my wife...
Did she always have reporters following her around like this?
Pretty much so.
I hear you moved into town.
I wanted to get Geoff out of L.A. Just start things over, you know?
That's Renee alright.
I suppose so.
When I was young I thought cats were the girls and dogs were the boys.
There are three more girls where that one came from looking for homes.
Thee facial lacerations should heal up pretty quickly. I'll give you som antibiotic cream--
--Drew, he's your dog. Are you listening to this?
I hear you've got Marjorie Hargrove working for you now.
How'd you know that?
I was building a doggy door.
God damn it Gus, you dug up my wife! What the fuck is going on around here?!
What?
I don't know what you expected to find, Matthews. There's nothing wrong with the antigens, nothing to indicate an unusual death...

Wait, there must be some mix-up. He was... the dog is alive.
Wait, there must be some mix-up. He was... the dog is alive.
Not this dog. There wasn't enough oxygen in those red cells to pump life into a flea.
You took over for Doctor Yolander?
Yes... why?
Yes... why?
Because the last person that sent me blood from a dead animal was Yolander...
Is something wrong?
Uh... no. You just... look different than you sounded on the phone. Please, come in.
I'm real excited about working for you Mr. Matthews...
Well we're glad to have you, Marjorie. You can call me Chase, by the way.
Out?
He's probably going up to the Pet Sematary. Kids've been going out there on Halloween night for years.
He's probably going up to the Pet Sematary. Kids've been going out there on Halloween night for years.
What do they do up there?
What do they do up there?
Oh, you know... drink beer, tell ghost stories. They try and spook each other out, talking about zombies and things... It's no big deal, Chase. I did it when I was young.
What happened to you?
I had a little run-in with Zowie.
I had a little run-in with Zowie.
You sure did...
I hope he doesn't have rabies.
He doesn't. I don't know what he has, but I'm hoping to God it's not infectious...
How long ago did this guy retire?
It's been a few years.
What's wrong?!
Nothing. I just got spooked by a bunch of furballs.
What's a lunch cost these days? You want ten?
Sure.
You nervous? New town, new school. I know it must be pretty hard for you...
I'll be fine, Dad.
Hey! How was your first day at school?
It sucked.
What?
You alright?
I think so.
Your Mom and I loved each other, Geoff. Don't ever think that we didn't.
Your Mom and I loved each other, Geoff. Don't ever think that we didn't.
I still can't believe she's dead...
Who was that?
Remember Zowie, Drew's dog? He got hurt again. I'm going over to take a look at him.
Hey! Where're you off to?
I'm going out, Dad!
Just out.
"Out." Well that's great, Geoff. Look, I've been letting you get away with a lot these past few weeks, but I'm not going to stand for crap like this. I don't care if it's Halloween... it's a school night, and if you do this again...

I'm really tired, Dad... can I just go to sleep?
Geoff, dinner's ready! Geoff?!
I'm not hungry.
What are you talking about?
I can bring her back. The same way Drew and me brought Zowie back...
Geoff, this is crazy. Zowie didn't die.
He did. We buried him. There's a place out in the woods... if you bury something there, it comes back alive.
All set?
All set.
So where're we going?
Anywhere but here.
Damn dog stuck his nose in on my rabbits and they ganged up on him. I swear that dog's an idiot.
Is he gonna be okay?
Drew, I don't remember inviting Zowie in for dinner.
Just until he heals up?
Not that much appreciation. I thought we were gonna tone down that flabby ass.
Hey, I'm so sorry I'm not the stud that you are.
Your momma's worried sick over you. You take off in the middle of the night, you don't show up for school. What're you trying to prove?
I'm not trying to prove anything. I was burying my dog.
Zowie...
Say your goodbyes. Zowie's going outside. You're grounded, buddy. That's the new law.
What's his name?
Zowie.
I've never seen anybody punch Clyde before.
He pissed me off.
He pissed me off.
Sorry about your mom. I couldn't handle not having my mom around. Just having Gus...
I swear, sometimes I wish Gus was dead...
You shouldn't ever say that about your parents, not even your Dad.
You shouldn't ever say that about your parents, not even your Dad.
Stepdad. Gus is my stepdad.
What was all that stuff about dead people coming back to life?
Nothing. It's just an old ghost story. Let's get out of here...
Is this a good spot?
I'm not burying him here...
I'm not burying him here...
Why not?
Why not?
There's a better place...
This is it... I wasn't sure if it even really existed.
What did?
What did?
The old Indian burial ground.
Come on, that's just a bullshit story. You said so yourself...
What if it's not bullshit? If I bury Zowie there, and it works... ...he'll come back alive.
What if it's not bullshit? If I bury Zowie there, and it works... ...he'll come back alive.
Drew, I know your dog died, but... get a grip, man, you're freaking me out.
Drew, I know your dog died, but... get a grip, man, you're freaking me out.
Look, if there was even one chance in a million it'd work, wouldn't you want to try?
You want me to help?
You have to bury your own. That's the way the Indians did it. It's like a rule...
I've never had anyone die before... ...but I guess you get over it. I mean, eventually...
You never get over it.
It's getting pretty late. We better go.
Yeah...
Maybe he wasn't dead when we buried him.
He was dead. You know he was.
You think my Dad'll figure out why he's not getting better?
You think he'd believe it if he did?
How can he not have a heartbeat?
Maybe it takes a while...
It's weird...
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
It's like he's not Gus anymore. He's different. You know, like Zowie...
What was that all about? You think he's trying to scare us?
I don't know but I'm not taking any chances...
Do you think everyone that came back would be like Gus?
I don't know... ...maybe it depends on what you were like before you...
I don't know... ...maybe it depends on what you were like before you...
Dies?
I gotta go back and do my chores...
Go later...
You ever think about running away?
All the time.
Geoff? Anybody see my boy?
Right here, Mom...
How long have you been here?
Couple minutes. I saw the last shot. That was pretty cool.
How did it go with your father last night?
Good. He said he'd be over for dinner at eight... I mean... he misses you, Mom...
Good. He said he'd be over for dinner at eight... I mean... he misses you, Mom...
I miss him too...
I know, Mom.
You know everything, don't you?
Mom...
I came back for you, Geoff. We're going to be together again.
Are we interrupting, Andy?
In a word, Bob...
In a word, Bob...
Charles is right behind me.
If MacroSystems wins, an energetic, young company will be destroyed, five thousand Americans will be out of work. Moreover, the laws of copyright and anti-trust were enacted to prevent exactly the kind of bullshit Macrosystems is trying to pull.

What was the file name?
K-R-O-one.
K-R-O-one.
Maybe you mistyped the name when you were saving it. We'll try combinations of those letters...
Do you really think so, Andy?
Yes, Bob, I do. Excuse me? Am I being fired?
Why, Beckett?
Because they deserve to, Walter.
Thanks, Walter.
What's that on your forehead, pal?
What's that on your forehead, pal?
Whacked with a racquetball. I appreciate your faith in my abilities.
You're right, I probably just misfiled...
Andy?
This time. What about next time?
There won't be a next time, I guarantee it.
Perhaps... you're right. I've certainly been busy. With the Kronos complaint, a preliminary injunction hearing and the Saunders trial all falling at the same time...
Some people think you have an attitude problem, Beckett.
Some people think you have an attitude problem, Beckett.
Really? Who thinks that, sir?
Excuse me, Charles. With all due respect... this is... preposterous! It doesn't make any sense, it sounds as if we're talking about someone else. Pardon the lack of humility, but I've had the distinct impression I was kind of... one of the rising stars around here. And I feel that wasn't just my imagination. And I also think I deserve to know what's really
Oh, you're right, Beckett, you don't have an attitude problem.
Thanks, you guys.
Yeah. Thanks, guys.
Aren't you giving an exam?
I said, don't worry about it.
I almost didn't make it to the bathroom, Miguel. I almost lost control right in front of everybody.
So what? It's nothing to be ashamed of. You have nothing to be ashamed of, okay?
It could be parasites, an infection...
A reaction to AZT...
Don't apologize for me.
He's not sorry, okay, fine. Why don't we see what we find out from the blood work? I'll work on getting a specimen, I'm sure hospital food could help in that direction. Maybe, by then, we'll hear from my doctor, and we'll go from there. Okay? Everybody happy?
That's the third time. I better call the office. Would you relax, please?
I am relaxed.
Why are you getting dressed?
You're not going to like this. Please try to smile...
Thanks for leaving school, and coming here, and... I will be back. An hour, tops.
You're going to the office?!

Jerk... What did you say?
I said, "Everyone's going to die, Jimmy. But Drew's not going to die of AIDS. There's a cure around the corner, and he plans to be around to take advantage of it."
You got that right, Mikey... You still believe that, don't you?
Yes. I think it will be a simple solution. They'll put it in a syringe, inject it into your bloodstream. It'll neutralize the virus. It'll revitalize the immune system, and people with AIDS will become healthy again.
Hold still. Shit. The goddamn vein's clotted. We have to go the goddamn hospital, so they can change the goddamn catheter.

It is, and it isn't, Charles. Macrosystem's new software copies all the best-known elements of Kronos' spreadsheet program. If they're allowed to sell it, Kronos will get undersold right out of business. For me, the legal principle, involved is copyright infringement.
Bearing in mind that Bill Wright, the chairman of MacroSystems, is a close, personal friend of mine... which side of this mess would <u>you</u> desire to be on, Andy? And don't allow my very tight, personal relationship with Bill to influence your answer in any way.
Thanks, Charles.
No sweat, buddy.
Thanks for coming in.
Of course.
I know that, Charles.
More than your friend. Family.
We've been talking it over, Andy. Your future that is... We feel that, because we respect you so much, we have to be honest with you.
Honesty is always best.
Take it easy, Walter.

You can save it for the jury, Charles. I want to hear you say, under oath, in front of a judge and a jury, I'm a bad lawyer. Gentlemen. Counselor.
Don't do this, Andy.
Longstreet's interested in the Harrisburg deal.
I'm seeing him this afternoon.
Mr. Beckett, I'm sorry...
About my blood work?
About my blood work?
We're waiting...
... meanwhile, I'd like to prepare you for a colonoscopy, so we can take a look inside.
Sounds delightful.
This is my partner. We keep records of hospital visits. Nothing personal.
Dr. Klenstein. It's not a pleasant procedure, but if the KS is causing the diarrhea, we ought to know right away.
I'm trying to help your "partner." You're not a member of his immediate family, I could have you removed from the ER.
He's upset, he's sorry.
Your Honor, since Rockwell Corp. began construction, the surrounding residential neighborhood has been enshrouded in a cloud of foul-smelling, germ-carrying, pestilent dust. My client is being forced to breathe known carcinogens daily! Other residents are coming forth on a daily basis to add their voices of outrage!
Your Honor, I submit there were no complaints until Counselor began knocking on doors, drumming up business. And the dust, which Counselor refers to, has appeared on only three occasions. Each time it has been examined and the results...
Innocuous?
Defined by Webster's as harmless.
Defined by Webster's as harmless.
I know what it means. Your Honor, imagine how the children in this neighborhood have been made to feel. The pounding of construction ringing in their ears as this skyscraper, a tribute to mankind's greed, grows daily, casting an ominous shadow over their lives, filling them with dread even as they are surrounded in a black, toxic fog, blocking out the sun while poisoning
Client of yours?
Funny.
Jesus Christ, what happened to you?
I have AIDS.
Whoa-oh! Sorry, I...
It's okay. Can I sit down?
It's okay. Can I sit down?
Uh, yeah.

Big trouble.
Charles, I must apologize again, for the Kronos mishap. It was a scary few minutes around here. Wow. But thank God, the complaint was found. And no damage was done.
I buy that.

The law says people with disabilities cannot be terminated, so long as they can perform the duties required by their position...
Okay, okay... They discover you have this horrible, disgusting, terminal illness, and they panic, for any number of perfectly valid reasons. They're frightened for themselves, their families...

Look. I know I have a case. If you don't want to take it for personal reasons...
Correct. I don't.
Thanks for your time.
Beckett? I'm sorry about... what's happened to you. It's a fucking kick in the head.
Beckett? I'm sorry about... what's happened to you. It's a fucking kick in the head.
Don't send flowers, Joe. I'm not dead yet.
Oh, Beckett. How's it goin'?
Fine.
Who'd you get?
What?
What?
Find a lawyer?
Find a lawyer?
I'm a lawyer. How's your baby?
I'm a lawyer. How's your baby?
Huh? Oh. Great. She's great.
Huh? Oh. Great. She's great.
What's her name?
What's her name?
Rayisha.
Rayisha.
Rayisha. Very nice.
How did they find out?
One of the partners spotted a lesion on my forehead.
The partner who spotted the lesion, Walter Kenton, used to work for Benton, Myers, in D.C. There's a paralegal there, Maria Torres. She's had lesions on and off for three years. She says it was common knowledge around the office that her lesions were caused by AIDS.
They didn't fire her?
They didn't fire her?
No. They didn't fire her.
So Kenton connected the... lesion, <u>and</u> whatever suspicions he had about your personal life... to this woman, Maria... and blew the whistle on you. Suddenly you're losing files, and it's time to let you go. But, up to this point, you've been their Golden Boy, their rising star... Their behavior is... inconsistent.
Thank you.
There is no relevant precedent.
Arline decision. Supreme Court.

Arline?
One more thing, Your Honor...
Any settlement agreement <u>must</u> include, and this is critical, a letter of exoneration, making clear my termination had nothing to do with the quality of my work.
PARRTYY!
We're friends of Beckett's.
We're friends of Beckett's.
It's me, you dork.

I had a blood transfusion today. I feel great.
I'm a law suit.
Not bad.

No, we have to do it. But later, allright?
No, we have to do it. But later, allright?
Thank you.
You think I'm uncomfortable...
Correct.
Correct.
You're right.
You survived your first gay party intact.
Let me tell you something, okay? When you're brought up, like the rest of us, in a place like where I was brought up, there's not a whole lot of discussion about... homosexuals. As a kid, you're taught right away that queers are weird, queers are funny, they're a danger to kids, they're afraid to fight, and they all want to cop your joint.

Let's review these notes for your testimony. We have a big day on Monday.
When you refer to Wheeler, call him Charles, to show how you'd been admitted to the inner circle, you were considered one of them.
Uh huh...

Beckett?
Charles. Okay. Miller?

Do you... pray?
Then we establish how Wheeler's boys recruited you after law school...

You're ready, don't worry.
Particularly, Charles.
What impressed you about him?

He was... the kind of person I thought I wanted to be.
He was... the kind of person I thought I wanted to be.
What kind of person is that?
What kind of person is that?
Possessed of an encyclopedic knowledge of the law. A razor sharp litigator, a genuine leader, gifted at bringing out the very best in others. An awesome ability to illuminate the most complex of legal concepts to colleagues, courtrooms, the person on the street. The kind of person who plays three sets of tennis but doesn't sweat. But underneath the elegant surface, was an adventurous
Obviously, at this time, you weren't sick.
It's possible I was infected with the HIV virus at that time, but I wasn't diagnosed until several years later.

In the years you worked at Wyant Wheeler, did you ever tell Charles Wheeler you were gay?

No. I didn't.
No. I didn't.
Can you explain <u>why</u> you didn't?
Can you explain <u>why</u> you didn't?
You don't bring your personal life into a law firm. You're not supposed to <u>have</u> a personal life, really. Anyway, I did plan to tell Charles, eventually. But then, this thing happened at the tennis club...
Are you a good lawyer?
I'm an excellent lawyer.

What do you love about it?
What do you love about it?
Well... many things. But I think the thing I love the most, is that every once in a while, not that often, but occasionally... you get to be part of justice being done. It's really quite a thrill when that happens.
Do you have any lesions on <u>any</u> part of your body, at this time, that resemble the lesions that were on your face at the time you were fired?
Yes. On my torso.
Yes. On my torso.
If it please the court, I'd like to ask Mr. Beckett to remove his shirt, so that the jury can have an <u>accurate</u> idea of what we're talking about.
Can you see the lesions on your chest in this mirror?
Yes.
Yes.
Thank you.
What do you call a thousand lawyers chained together at the bottom of the ocean?
What?
What?
A good start.
Excellent work, Joe. I thank you.
It was good working with you, Andrew. You're welcome. Hey. Shouldn't you put that thing back on?
I better get home. Lisa and I are having some friends over.
Sure thing.
Thanks for coming by.
You bet. We'll see you later.

Yes.
You've testified the lesions on your face were visible to the people you worked with, correct?
That's right.
That's right.
And it's your contention, that when the partners were made aware of the lesions, they jumped to the conclusion you had AIDS and fired you.

Hi, Mom. It's me.
Andy! This is a nice surprise. How are you, hon?
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
What's Dr. Gillman say?
What's Dr. Gillman say?
Hold on, Mom. There's no way my client will go along with that.
Gillman says I'm fine. My blood work is excellent. T-cells are up. Just a sec ... Yes, I think that would alleviate most of our concerns. My platelets look good too.
Are you on one of those conference calls? I hate when you put me on hold.
Hi, Mom. How do you feel on your fortieth anniversary?
Ancient. How do you think I feel? Put that thing down and give me a hug. Andrew, stop! ... He still doesn't listen.

Where's Dad?
Where's Dad?
He's out in his shed showing your uncle his new riding mower.
Mom?
All I know is, you got through your diagnosis fine, like a trooper. But when they fired you... you were so devastated, Andy... I don't expect any of my kids to sit in the back of the bus. Fight for your rights.

He was losing weight. He looked kind of tired sometimes. But he was working so hard... Still, I felt something was wrong. And I can't believe <u>they're</u> saying they didn't notice anything.

Miss Burton? Do you still work at Wyant Wheeler?
Yes.
Yes.
Were you recently promoted?

No. Have you ever felt discriminated against, at Wyant Wheeler?

Yes.
In what way?
Well... One time, Mr. Wheeler's secretary, Lydia, told me Mr. Wheeler had a problem with my earrings.
Well... One time, Mr. Wheeler's secretary, Lydia, told me Mr. Wheeler had a problem with my earrings.
Your earrings?
Apparently, Mr. Wheeler felt they were too... "ethnic" is the word she used. She said he would like it if I wore something smaller, less garish, and... more "American."
What did you say?
What did you say?
I said my earrings <u>are</u> American. They're African-American.

And, when lawyers break the law, when this society loses respect for the law, when that day comes, our cherished institutions will be burned to the ground, and our children and grandchildren will live like savages.
Fact. Andrew Beckett performed at a consistently mediocre level. Fact. He made a grievous error on a multi-million dollar lawsuit... Fact. He claims he is the victim of lies and deceit. Fact. Andrew Beckett lied to his employers, going to great efforts to conceal his disease from them. Fact. He was successful in his duplicity. The partners at Wyant Wheeler did <u>not</u> know Andrew
Objection!
I'll rephrase. Did you have anything to do with this file being... misplaced?
Objection!
I'll withdraw. You were aware, when you worked with Maria Torres, that she had AIDS, correct?
Objection!
I'll withdraw it. Mr. Beckett? Were you living with Miguel Alvarez in 1984 or 1985 when you had your anonymous sexual encounter in the porn theater?
We object, Your Honor. It would unfairly influence the jury.
Your Honor, if Mr. Beckett was forced by his illness to use a wheelchair, would the defense ask him to park it outside? We're talking about AIDS, we're talking about lesions. Let's <u>see</u> what we're talking about.
You had contact with someone who has AIDS, and you're worried.
I'm not worried. What are you doing?
The HIV virus can only be transmitted through the exchange of bodily fluids, namely blood and semen.
Right.
Leave that.
Yeah, but Doc, isn't it true they keep finding out new things about this disease? So you tell me, today, there's no danger, and I go home, and I hold my baby, and six months from now I hear on the news: "whoops! We were wrong.' You <u>can</u> carry it on your clothes, your skin, and now I've got to worry about my kid.
We're going to draw blood.
Why are we going to do that?
Why are we going to do that?
Joe. I don't care a whit about your private life.
Joe. I don't care a whit about your private life.
You want to give me an AIDS <u>test</u>?!
The guy sat in my office! You can't get AIDS that way, right?
Right.
Right.
It doesn't travel through the air, by breathing, or touching, right?
It doesn't travel through the air, by breathing, or touching, right?
Not by touching, or shaking hands, or hugging, using the same toilet... Even kissing someone with AIDS is safe. But it there's something in your past you're worried about...

Thanks, Doc, but I don't need an AIDS test. Are you crazy? But thanks for the information. Really.
A homosexual encounter.
Get real.
Get real.
Unprotected sex with a prostitute.

Uh.... No. Not really.

Andrew Beckett represented your company in a lawsuit in 1990, is that correct?
Wyant Wheeler represented us.
But, Andrew Beckett was in charge of litigation for the suit.
That's correct.
That's correct.
Were you pleased with his work?
Were you pleased with his work?
We were satisfied.
Mr. Laird, when I approached you about being a witness at this trial, and you agreed, you gave sworn testimony in a deposition. Is that correct?
That's correct.
That's correct.
According to the deposition, you said you were "thrilled, impressed, overwhelmed" by the quality of Andrew Beckett's work. Do you remember saying that?
According to the deposition, you said you were "thrilled, impressed, overwhelmed" by the quality of Andrew Beckett's work. Do you remember saying that?
I may have said something like that. But that's not how I feel at this moment.
Okay, Mr. Laird. Explain this to me like I'm a four year old: Did Andrew Beckett win your lawsuit for you or not?
We won.
We won.
Did that thrill, impress and overwhelm you?
Did that thrill, impress and overwhelm you?
It satisfied me.
It's a long way between being overwhelmed and being satisfied. A cheeseburger may be satisfying whereas caviar and champagne and roast duck and baked Alaska for dessert might be considered overwhelming. Do you agree?
I might.
I might.
Five months ago you characterized Andrew Beckett as caviar and now you're calling him a cheeseburger. Your standards have shifted a great deal, and I'd like to know why you've changed your mind.
Five months ago you characterized Andrew Beckett as caviar and now you're calling him a cheeseburger. Your standards have shifted a great deal, and I'd like to know why you've changed your mind.
Since that time I've devoted more thought to the subject, and that's how I feel now.
Andy. Before we begin, I'd just like to say: everyone in this room is your friend.
You're in trouble.
Let's put it this way, Andy: your place in the future of this firm is no longer secure.
In a word, yes.
In a word, yes.
We don't think it's fair to keep you here, where your future is limited. But we wish you luck, Andy, all the luck in the world.
And I hate to rush you out of here, but...
But he's got lots of other people's lives to ruin...
But he's got lots of other people's lives to ruin...
... we've got a committee meeting.
Explain to me, if you can, Mr. Wheeler, explain this to me like I'm a ten year-old. This trial is not about a disease, is that what you're saying? <u>Not</u> about your understandable, if unfounded, fear of catching AIDS through casual contact with someone who has it? You're saying, this trial is about Andrew Beckett's character. Am I getting this right?
Yes, character. To the extent that it affects a person's ability to do a great job.
Sometimes it seems like society is <u>run</u> by these kinds of people.
What kind of people?
What kind of people?
People who want to bend the rules...
Good school. What year?

I mean, two guys, doing the horizontal thing? I don't get it. Don't they get confused? "Is that mine? I thought it was yours." Hey, call me old fashioned, call me conservative... I think maybe you have to be a man to get just how nauseating the whole basic idea really is.

Don't know, Joe.
Is there some kind of expression I've picked up from Beckett?! Some kind of fairy attitude I've unconsciously adopted?! Am I walking different?! Some kind of vocal thing?! Have I picked up some kind of homo <u>vibe</u>?!

Great, Lisa. Thank you.

Whoa, whoa... What do you expect them to say, you're Alan Dershowitz?
A trial takes <u>time</u>, Beckett. Do you know what I'm saying?
Anywhere from two weeks, to several months.
Any women on board?
Not when I was in the Navy.
So during those long voyages, months at a time, out to sea, no women in sight, a hundred, hardworking, robust, young men, in the prime of their life, at the peak of their natural appetites, desires, their god- given, hormonal <u>instincts</u>... Anything going on?

Like... two sailors playing hide the salami.
Yeah. But we took care of him.
How did you do that?
How did you do that?
We stuck his head in the latrine, after ten of us had used it.
You taught him a lesson.
Yes, we did.
Yes, we did.
Like firing Andrew Beckett taught <u>him</u> a lesson?

By God you <u>will</u> settle it! If you force this case to trial, young man, you'll regret it for the rest of your natural-born days... Now, Joseph. What would you require to settle this matter today?

Hold it, Joe. He wants to come back to work, Chuck.
Based on what my client would have earned over the next three years, including benefits and projected raises, and the extraordinary cost of medical care for someone with Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome... We would settle today for the very fair amount of one million five hundred thousand dollars.
Very good, Joe. Now, Belinda, I've got a figure over here, of one million, five. I...
In this courtroom, Mr. Miller, justice is blind. To matters of race, creed, color, religion. And sexual orientation.
With all due respect, Your Honor... We don't live in this courtroom, do we?
With all due respect, Your Honor... We don't live in this courtroom, do we?
No. We don't... However, as regards this witness, I'm going to sustain the defense's objection.
Let's continue.
You had one guy "like that?"
This would be a good time to break for the day...
Your Honor? May I have ten minutes in re-direct?
Your Honor? May I have ten minutes in re-direct?
Beckett?
It's good to be King, hey Charles?
Kings are out of fashion. I'd rather be thought of as a benevolent tyrant. It's an anti-trust action.
Andy. It seems that something has come over you, lately: A kind of... stupor, a fogginess, a lack of focus... Earth to Andy. Anybody home?
Helloooo...
Julius!
Dr. J.!
Andrew brought AIDS into our offices, into our men's room. He brought AIDS to our annual goddamn family picnic.
We ought to be suing him.
Wait a minute. The man was fired for incompetence, not because he has AIDS. You didn't know he was sick, did you, Bob?
Holy Shit. Did you, Bob?
You'll be sorry, Beckett.
Andy, you don't want this.
... to suit their personal desires, and the rest of us have to live with it.
You have to make a decision: is this guy partner material?
... interview every employee, support staff, associates, partners. Did <u>any</u> of them know Andy was sick? <u>How</u> did they know? Did he tell them? Did they notice something was wrong with his appearance? None of this information got to the managing partners. We know that. Make sure everyone else does too... And Beckett: I want to know everything about his personal life. Did he
Jesus.
Jesus.
What about other homosexual facilities, whatever they are?
What about other homosexual facilities, whatever they are?
Charles...
Charles...
What deviant groups or organizations did he secretly belong to? What is it, Bob?!
What deviant groups or organizations did he secretly belong to? What is it, Bob?!
Let's settle with Andy and put this whole tragic mess behind us.
That's kind of... extreme, Walt. Andy's private life is none of our business.
Bob. You're trying my patience. Andrew Beckett is making his private life our business. We gave him Kronos. Did he say, "I'm sick. I might not be able to see this through?"
Bob. You're trying my patience. Andrew Beckett is making his private life our business. We gave him Kronos. Did he say, "I'm sick. I might not be able to see this through?"
He was doing a great job.
He was doing a great job.
Bob. I must ask you to shut the fuck up. Did Andrew Beckett say "I might not be able to serve our clients to the <u>best of my ability</u>?" He said nothing. And now, Andrew Beckett proposes to haul me into a court of law, to sling accusations at me, in full view of the entire, Philadelphia, judicial establishment. My God.
I've discovered something interesting, Charles.
... keep them from that area, on grounds of relevancy. What, Bob?
... keep them from that area, on grounds of relevancy. What, Bob?
No matter how hard I try, I can't lose a file in my computer.
Very interesting, Bob. Let's make a note of that. Andy didn't lose the complaint in his computer. He never put it in. He lied about that, too.
Charles...
Charles...
If you feel differently, Bob, you should say so, when you're called to the stand. After all, this isn't a conspiracy.
I didn't tell the others, I was afraid to...
... But now, we're standing up for ourselves...
... But now, we're standing up for ourselves...
... But we shouldn't have fired him...
... But we shouldn't have fired him...
... It's time to get this society back on track!
Don't wanna miss this.
Lookit. Lookit!
Gonna lose everybody out here....
He died fast. And if we got any choice, that's the way we should all go out. Don't you cry for Johns. Don't you dare.
What? What is it?
It's a fucking staircase! Go over it! GO OVER IT!
You came for us....
Yeah, yeah -- we're all fuckin' amazed. Anyone not ready for this?
Probably okay to talk to me now.
Not sure where to go. I was just runnin' away when this whole thing started. Where you goin'?
Not sure where to go. I was just runnin' away when this whole thing started. Where you goin'?
Not sure. I was just runnin' away when this whole thing....
Audrey? Oh, Audrey....
<u>What</u>?
Tell me that was you.
Okay, it was me. What'd I do now?
Okay, it was me. What'd I do now?
Assailing my fragile sense of security, that's what.
Oh, Lord....
It was just somebody else. From the crash. He was just....
You mean...tonight? With all those things still out there?
Oh, sure. Why not? Sounds like a hoot.
Liquid oxygen canisters inside. Start ripping them out. Quick hits only -- try to make it last.
Well, is someone coming for us? Or are we all just gonna die of exposure or dehydration or sunstroke or maybe even something worse? Hey, you don't have to worry about scaring me.
Bottle-count.
Four fulls, one half. That mean we're halfway there? I hope?
I didn't want you to leave me there... back at the ship...that's why I didn't say anything....
No, we'd never....Oh, God, honey, you shoulda told me sooner.
Bring the light!
What're they doing? What're <u>we</u> --
What're they doing? What're <u>we</u> --
Leave the sled, let's go, go, go!
Three full bottles. But almost time to refill.
Doesn't seem like enough to turn back on, does it?
Tell me about the sounds. You told them you heard something right before.... If you don't talk to me, Johns'll take another crack at it -- at your skull.
'Mean the whispers?
'Mean the whispers?
What whispers?
What whispers?
The ones tellin' me to go for the sweet spot -- just to the left of the spine, fourth lumbar down. The abdominal aorta. What a gusher. Had a cup on his belt, so I used it to catch a little run-off. Metallic taste to it, human blood. Coppery. But if you cut it with peppermint schnapps, that goes away. Course, that's more for
All you people are so scared of me -- an' most days, I'd take that as a compliment -- but it ain't me you gotta worry about now.
Show me your eyes.
You did this? To yourself?
Slam doctor. Well, we called him "doctor."
Slam doctor. Well, we called him "doctor."
Heard about it. Just never seen it.
Heard about it. Just never seen it.
Fairly fuckin' ironic, wouldn't you say? Slamlight's so dim that you go and get your eyeballs taken out and shined up -- then you wind up here. Three ass-kick suns. Maybe I did do a few people. But not this one. No ma'am, not this time.

Then where is he? He's not in the hole. We looked.
Then where is he? He's not in the hole. We looked.
Look deeper.
Power cells.
They're coming.
They're coming.
Strange, not doin' a run-up on the main drive yet. Strange unless he told you the particulars of my escape.

Entered our minds.
Entered our minds.
I asked what <u>you</u> thought.
I asked what <u>you</u> thought.
You scare me, Riddick. That's what you wanna hear, isn't it? There, I admit it, Can I get back to work now?
Why, what'd you hear?
Well, guess if it was trickeration he'd just do me, huh? Then again...I am worth twice as much alive. Didn't know? Johns ain't a cop. Oh, he's got that shiny badge an' all, but nah -- he's just a merc and I'm just a payday. That's why he won't kill me. The creed is greed.
Riddick...was thinkin' we should make some kind of deal. Just in case, you know, this actually --
Had it with deals.
Had it with deals.
But I just wanted to say --
But I just wanted to say --
Nobody's gonna turn a murderer loose. I fuckin' knew better.
Been a long time since anyone's trusted me. That's somethin' right there.
We can, can't we? Trust you?
We can, can't we? Trust you?
Actually... That's what I been askin' myself.
Where are the sand-cat tracks? Why aren't we still following them?
Saw something I didn't like.
What do you see? Riddick?
Hunger. I see 60 years of hunger.
Riddick? What the hell are you --
<u>Listen</u>.
Canyon ahead. I circled once to buy some time to think.
Think about what?
What about her?
What it's gonna be like when we hit that canyon. With her bleeding.
Back to the ship, huh?
Get out of our way.
Get out of our way.
So everybody huddles together till the lights burn out? Until you can't see what's eating you? That the big plan?
How many you see?
One or two.
One or two.
Audrey?
We're just here to carry your light, aren't we? Just the torch-bearers.
Let's drop back an' boot up.
As fast as you can.
You sure you can keep --
You sure you can keep --
As fast as you can.
So where the hell's God now, huh? I'll tell you where! He's up there PISSING ON ME!
Riddick? How close?
Tell me the settlement is right there! RIDDICK, PLEASE!
We can't make it.
Strong survival instinct. Admire that in a woman.
You're not leaving. Not until we go back for the others.
I promised them we'd go back with more light. And that's exactly what we're gonna do..
Think you've mistaken me for somebody who gives a fuck.
Think you've mistaken me for somebody who gives a fuck.
What, you're afraid?
What, you're afraid?
Confusin' me with Johns now -- fear was <u>his</u> monkey. I only deal in life and death. All that stuff in between? Some shade of grey my eyes don't see.
Confusin' me with Johns now -- fear was <u>his</u> monkey. I only deal in life and death. All that stuff in between? Some shade of grey my eyes don't see.
<u>I trusted you</u>, Riddick. Goddamn, I trusted that some part of you wanted to rejoin the human race.
<u>I trusted you</u>, Riddick. Goddamn, I trusted that some part of you wanted to rejoin the human race.
Truthfully? I wouldn't know how.
Just come with me!
Got a better idea. Come with <u>me</u>.
They're already dead. Get on board.
You're fuckin' with me. I know you are.
You're fuckin' with me. I know you are.
'Course I am -- but doesn't mean I won't leave you here. If you believe anything about me, better be that.
'Course I am -- but doesn't mean I won't leave you here. If you believe anything about me, better be that.
No, you see, I <u>promised</u> them...I have to...I have to go and....
Step aboard, Carolyn.
I can't....I can't....
I can't....I can't....
Here. Make it easy on you.
Here. Make it easy on you.
Don't do this to me....
Don't do this to me....
Just give me your hand.
Just give me your hand.
But they...they could still be....
But they...they could still be....
No one's gonna blame you. C'mon. Take my hand and save yourself, Carolyn.
You'd die for them?
I would try for them.
I would try for them.
You barely know them.
You barely know them.
But I'm human. I know you view that as a weakness, but I'm sorry -- I <u>do</u> feel fear, theirs too. Goddamnit, Riddick -- yes. I would die for them.
This is it? Booze? <u>That's</u> what you have to drink?
200-year-old single-malt scotch is to "booze" as foie gras is to "duck guts."
What do my eyes see?
It's starting....
Just a suggestion, but perhaps we should flee.
Cargo hold, everyone in the cargo hold. lesgo, lesgo, lesgo.
Christ, you don't know what's out there!
I know what's in here!
There....
Like the light is scalding it.
Like the light is scalding it.
It hurts them. Light actually hurts them....
...one cutting torch...one handlight here, two more in the cabin...I <u>think</u> two more....
Spirits. Anything over 45 proof burns well.

How many bottles?
How many bottles?
Not sure. Ten?
Not sure. Ten?
Those umbrellas, the ones that mist. Would they burn? If you got a receipt?
Those umbrellas, the ones that mist. Would they burn? If you got a receipt?
Possibly.
Possibly.
Awright. So maybe we'll have enough light.
I hate to kill a beautiful theory with an ugly fact, but that sand-cat won't run at night.
We'll have to carry the cells...drag them...whatever it takes.
Let's move. Just a detour. He'll get us there.
Can we switch?
Can we switch?
What, switch what?
What, switch what?
I think I twisted my ankle running backwards like that. And I'm not sure I can.... Okay, that's a lie. I just don't want to be alone back there anymore. If you could just give me a few minutes up front here --
Hey.
Hey, who?
Hey, who?
Hey, me. Over here.
Amazing. I'm Johns.
Carolyn Fry. I'd shake hands, but...
And him?
Big Evil?

We just keep him locked up forever?

Be my choice. Already escaped once from the max-slam facility on --
Be my choice. Already escaped once from the max-slam facility on --
I don't need his life story. Is he really that dangerous?
I don't need his life story. Is he really that dangerous?
Only around humans.
S'matter?
Little swamp-flu from the Conga system. Never shook it with all this cryo-sleep.
A very good sign. That's Riddick's direction. You do <u>not</u> wanna be caught in the dark with this guy.
Thought you found his restraints over there. Toward sunset.
Thought you found his restraints over there. Toward sunset.
Which means he went toward sunrise.
What?
Tell me it's not a mirage.
Probably makes it worse. Dehydrates you even more.
Probably right.
No, no, I wanted to get away.
So I noticed. Never seen a "captain" quite so ready to leave her ship.
Better keep moving....
What'd Owens mean? 'Bout not touching the switch?
Hey. You can tell me, Carolyn.
Promise me. Swear to me you won't --
Promise me. Swear to me you won't --
You see anybody else here? Just between you and me.
You see anybody else here? Just between you and me.
During the landing...when things were at their worst...Owens was at his best. He's the one who wouldn't let the pilot dump the passenger cabin.
So now you know.
Fuck. Guess I'm more glad to be here than I thought.
Didn't bite.
What?
What?
Thought he might be coolin' it in the boneyard -- could either double-back to the ship or slip in behind us. So I left the bottle out as bait.
No juice, looks like it's been laid up for years. But we might be able to adapt --
Shut up.
Sorry. Thought I heard something.
Like what?
Like what?
Like my pistola.
...I don't play that...I don't play that so just try again. C'mon, Riddick, tell me a better lie....
Ease up, ease up. JOHNS! Just tell me what....
He used that?
Sir Shiv-a-lot. He likes to cut.
Sir Shiv-a-lot. He likes to cut.
So why isn't it all bloody?
So why isn't it all bloody?
I assume he licked it clean.
I <u>know</u> what happened -- he went off on the guy, buried him on the hill somewhere, and now he's trying to --
Let's just be sure.
Let's just be sure.
I <u>am</u> sure. Look, murders aside, Riddick belongs in the Asshole Hall of Fame. He loves the jaw-jackin', loves making you afraid, 'cuz that's all he has. And you're playing right into --
I <u>am</u> sure. Look, murders aside, Riddick belongs in the Asshole Hall of Fame. He loves the jaw-jackin', loves making you afraid, 'cuz that's all he has. And you're playing right into --
<u>We're gonna find the body</u>, Johns. Christ, you're a cop. Why am I tellin' you this? We gotta go down and find it.
<u>We're gonna find the body</u>, Johns. Christ, you're a cop. Why am I tellin' you this? We gotta go down and find it.
Well, don't ask me to.
Well, don't ask me to.
Thought you didn't believe his story.
Thought you didn't believe his story.
I don't. But that ground looked none too stable, and I don't want anyone --
Nobody else is going down but me, okay?
Hey. Bein' ballsy with your life now doesn't change what came before -- it's just stupid.
Hey. Bein' ballsy with your life now doesn't change what came before -- it's just stupid.
What, you think I'm doin' this to prove something?

You said it, not me. Let's just not let one bad call lead to another.
You said it, not me. Let's just not let one bad call lead to another.
Thanks for the tip, Johns.
Little ratty-ass.
Nothing we can't repair -- so long as the electrical adapts.
Okay, that should buy us a sys-check. But we'll need more cells.
How many?
How many?
15 6-gigs here...90 gigs total...other ship carries 20-gig cells, so...five. Five total to launch.
15 6-gigs here...90 gigs total...other ship carries 20-gig cells, so...five. Five total to launch.
25 kilos each, huh?
Rag it, Riddick. Nobody wants your theories on --
So what happened? Where are they, then?
Let's board this up and get the hell gone. They seem to stick to the dark, so if we stick to daylight, should be all --
60 years ago.
60 years ago.
Wha'?
...need those cells from the crash ship. Shit, still gotta check out the hull, patch the wings --
Let's wait on the power cells.
Let's wait on the power cells.
Wait for what? Until it's so dark we can't even find our way back to --

We're not sure <u>when</u> it happens, so let's not --

He can pilot?
Hijacked a prison transport, made a helluva good run 'fore I tracked him down.

Okay, maybe that's a <u>good</u> thing. Maybe I can use him to help with --
Okay, maybe that's a <u>good</u> thing. Maybe I can use him to help with --
He also figured out how to kill the pilot, Fry.
You said we were going to trust him now. You said there was a deal.
That's what I said.
Oh, this is a dangerous game you're playing, Johns.
May've noticed chains don't work on this guy. Only way we're truly safe is if he believes he's goin' free. But if he <u>stops</u> believin' --
May've noticed chains don't work on this guy. Only way we're truly safe is if he believes he's goin' free. But if he <u>stops</u> believin' --
You mean, if he learns that you're gonna royally fuck him over.
You mean, if he learns that you're gonna royally fuck him over.
-- we need a fail-safe. Bring the cells over at the last possible minute -- when the wings are ready, when we <u>know</u> we're ready to launch.
You know, he hasn't harmed any of us. Far as I can tell, he hasn't even lied to us. Just stick to the deal, Johns. Let him go if that's what it --
He's a murderer. The law says he's gotta do his bid.
Dancin' on razor blades here...
I won't give him a chance to grab another ship -- or to slash another pilot's throat.
You're not a real cop, are you? Just some mercenary who goes around talkin' about the law like --
I never said I was.
I never said I was.
Never said you were a hype, either.
You have a little caffeine in the morning, I have a little morphine. So what?
And here you got two mornings every day. Wow, were you <u>born</u> lucky?

Not a problem unless you're gonna make --

Owens was already dead. His brain just hadn't caught on to that fact.
Owens was already dead. His brain just hadn't caught on to that fact.
Anything <u>else</u> we should know about you, Johns? Christ, here I am lettin' you play games with our lives when --
My first run-in with Riddick. Went for the sweet-spot and missed. They had to leave a piece of the shiv in there. I can feel it, sometimes, pressing against the cord. So maybe the care and feeding of my nerve-endings is my business.
You coulda helped. And you didn't.
Stop it, stop it, STOP IT!
'Sokay, 'sokay. I killed it.
Oh, lady. If you're in your right mind, I pray you go insane.
We can stick to the plan. If we get four cells back to the skiff, we're off this rock.
Look, we gotta think about everyone now -- the kid especially. How scared is she gonna be out there?
Oh, don't use her like that, for a smoke screen.
Oh, don't use her like that, for a smoke screen.
Smoke screen for what?
Smoke screen for what?
For your own fear.
For your own fear.
Hey. Why don't you rag your hole for two seconds and let someone else come up with a plan that doesn't involve MASS SUICIDE?
How much you weigh, Johns?
What the hell's it matter?
What the hell's it matter?
How much?
How much?
79 kilos.
79 kilos.
Because you're 79 kilos of gutless white meat, and <u>that's</u> why you can't come up with a better plan.
He'll lead you over the first cliff. You know that, don't you?
We're just burnin' light here.
We're just burnin' light here.
You give him the cells and the ship -- and he will leave you. He will leave you all out there to die.
You give him the cells and the ship -- and he will leave you. He will leave you all out there to die.
I don't get it, Johns. What is so goddamn valuable in your life that you're worried about losing? Huh? Is there anything at all? Besides your next hype? Got no right to be so scared. Neither one of us.
So you noticed too?
Riddick. <u>Riddick</u>.
We aren't completely stupid.
Stay in the light! Everybody! Stay in the fucking --
Hey, <u>you're</u> the one who got me out here, turned me into a goddamn sled dog. An' now you 'spect me to go back like a <u>whipped</u> dog?
I was wrong. I admit it. My bad, okay? Now let's just go back to the ship.
I was wrong. I admit it. My bad, okay? Now let's just go back to the ship.
I dunno. Nice breeze, wide open spaces -- you know, I'm startin' to enjoy myself out here.

Are you fucking high again? Just listen to --
Are you fucking high again? Just listen to --
No, no, you're right, Fry. What's to be afraid of? My life is a steamin' pile of meaningless toadshit anyhow. So I say mush on! Canyon's only couple hundred meters, after that we're in Skiff City! So why don't you just butch up, stuff a cork in that kid, and get --
This does not help us, Johns.
-- she tried to blow the whole fucking passenger cabin, tried to kill us --
-- she tried to blow the whole fucking passenger cabin, tried to kill us --
Just shut up, okay?

-- tried to kill us in our sleep. Paris had it right -- we <u>are</u> disposable. We're just walking ghosts to her.
Would you RAG YOUR STUPID HOLE!
We cannot go through there....
How much you weigh right now, Fry? Huh?
It's the atmosphere. Too much pressure, not enough oxygen. Might take a few days to --
So what the bloody hell happened, anyways?
So what the bloody hell happened, anyways?
Somethin' knocked us off-lane. Maybe a rogue comet. Maybe we'll never know.
Well? Is it just the pump?
Ask if anyone has anything in cargo! Anything to drink!
Imam. We should leave soon. Before nightfall but while it's cooler.
What, you're goin' off, too?
What, you're goin' off, too?
Johns is leaving you a gun. Just do me a favor, huh? Get my crewies buried? They were good guys who died bad.
Why did I fall on you?
He's dead. Cap'n's dead. Christ, I was looking right at him when --
He's dead. Cap'n's dead. Christ, I was looking right at him when --
I mean, I mean, chrono shows we're 22 weeks out, so gravity wasn't supposed to kick in for another 19. I mean, I mean, I mean, why did I fall <u>at all</u>?

You hear me? Captain's dead. Owens too.
Oh, no. Not Owens, not.... Wai', wai', wait. <u>I'm Owens</u>. Right?
1550 millibars, dropping 20 MB per minute, shit, we're hemorrhaging air. <u>Somethin'</u> took a swipe at us.
Just tell me we're still in the shipping lane. Just show me all those stars, all those bright, beautiful, deep-space....
Fry?
Can't get my nose down...too much load back there....
Can't get my nose down...too much load back there....
You mean that "load" of passengers?
You mean that "load" of passengers?
So what, we should both go down too? Out of sheer fucking nobility?
Look, Fry. Company says we're responsible for every one of those --
Company's not here, is it?
Company's not here, is it?
When captain went down, you stepped up -- whether you like it or not. Now they train you for this, so --
When captain went down, you stepped up -- whether you like it or not. Now they train you for this, so --
And there wasn't a simulated cockroach alive within 50 clicks of the simulated crash site! <u>That's</u> how they train you! On a fucking simulator!
Owens!
70 seconds! You still got 70 seconds to level this beast out!
I don't suppose....
One of the Christian habits we <u>didn't</u> adopt -- perhaps unfortunately. We'll have to wait.
So quiet. You get used to the sounds of the ship, then....
You know who Muhammad was?
You know who Muhammad was?
Some prophet guy?

We're all on the same hajj now.
One is all?
For now.
I saw the cut-marks on the bones. Wasn't a natural die-off.
Quiet, please. Everyone.
Hasan?
Riddick?
They're afraid of our light. That means we don't have to be so afraid of them.
And you're certain you can find the way back? Even in the dark?
And you're certain you can find the way back? Even in the dark?
No, I'm not. But <u>he</u> can.
Imam. Slow down.
What?
What?
Don't stop, just slow down. Little more space 'tween us and them.
Don't stop, just slow down. Little more space 'tween us and them.
I would rather we all stay--
I would rather we all stay--
Do what I say. Please.
The sled as a shield....
And what about the cells?
Oh, no. No, no, no....
Rain.
Has anyone seen the young one? Ali?
Has anyone checked the coring room?
Well...we must keep her close, then. Here, she'll be safe if we put her between --
There is no "safe."
Where's Mr. Johns?
Which half?
Which half?
You mean....
What're you doin'?
Blessing you like the others. It's painless.
Blessing you like the others. It's painless.
And pointless.
And pointless.
I see. Well, even if you don't believe in God, it doesn't mean He won't be --
I see. Well, even if you don't believe in God, it doesn't mean He won't be --
You <u>don't</u> see.
'Cuz you don't spend half your life in lock-down with a horse-bit in your mouth and not believe. And you surely don't start out in a liquor store trash bin with an umbilical cord wrapped around your neck and not believe. Oh, absolutely I believe in God. And I absolutely hate the fucker.
He will be with us. Nonetheless.
He will be with us. Nonetheless.
Give my blessing to the girl. She needs a spare.
Suleiman!
Get the girl back under. Keep going.

SULEIMAN!

New Mecca....
Think a soul could get lost there? With all those pilgrim-types?
Think a soul could get lost there? With all those pilgrim-types?
It's more a place where souls are found, Mr. Riddick.
For what? There is no water. You understand that, don't you?
All deserts have water, somewhere. God shall lead us there.
"God is Great," yes?
I'm born-again.
We got you...it's okay, it's okay...we got you now....
The child heard you before any of us could even....
I had the impression...from the model... that the two planets were moving as one. That there would be...a lasting darkness.
Those suns gotta come back <u>sometime</u>. And if these animals really are phobic about light, we just sit tight till then.
Oh, Trash Baby, you're gonna regret this.
Please...this solves nothing...please....
We crossed our own tracks.
He's running us 'round in circles. Look for yourself. Look!
She's the captain, we should listen to --
Listen to her? <u>Her</u>? When she was willing to sacrifice us all?
...then we saw this.
Anyone else having breathing problems? Aside from me?
King Tut's tomb....
Be surprised what these will fetch in the Taurus system. Here. This Wooten here -- easy, easy. Very rare.
A toast to whatever he just said.
I'll need a receipt for that. For all these.
What the hell are these?
Maratha crow-bill war-picks from Northern India. Very rare.
So just like that. Wave your little wand and he's one of us now.
Didn't say that. But least this way I don't have to worry about falling asleep and not wakin' up.
Well, just a skiff. Disposable, really.
Like an emergency life-raft, right?
Very big beads.
Not staying in here another....
She's the pilot, she should stay close to the cells.
Oh, so I'm disposable?
Found somethin' worse than me, huh?
We're movin'. And I'm just wondering if I shouldn't lighten the load right now.
Want you to remember this moment, Riddick. The way it coulda gone and didn't.
Say that again.
Say that again.
Here's the deal. You work without the chains, without the bit -- without the shivs. You help us get off this rock....
Here's the deal. You work without the chains, without the bit -- without the shivs. You help us get off this rock....
For what? The honor of goin' back to some asshole of a cell?
For what? The honor of goin' back to some asshole of a cell?
Truth is, Riddick, I'm tired of this head-up shit. I wanna be free of you as much as you wanna be free of me.
You'd cut me loose, Boss?
Only if we both get outta this alive. And there may be a way.
My recommendation: Do me. Don't take the chance that I'll get shiv-happy on your wannabe ass. Ghost me, Riddick. Would if I were you.
If you were me, I'd kill us both. C'mon, you wanna sit at the grown-up table or not?
Are you fuckin' kidding me?
Not afraid of the dark, are you?
I'd rather piss glass.
Well, you got the big gauge.
Well, you got the big gauge.
Wanna rag your fat mouth?
Think about that reward, Johns.
I'm willing to take a cut in pay.
I'm willing to take a cut in pay.
How 'bout a cut in your gut?
<u>Fuck me</u>. You said "clear."
Said "looks clear."
Said "looks clear."
Well, what's it look like now?
Well, what's it look like now?
Looks clear.
Such as.
Hard to tell, sometimes...even for me... but looked like a bunch of those big boys chewin' each other's gonads off. Thought we'd swing wide. Okay by you?
About how to kill us and still get these cells to the skiff. Goddamnit, we're just doin' the heavy lifting for this prick!
About the girl.
What're you jaw-jackin' about? Girl's not cut.
No. She's not.
Aw, this can't be happening to me....
They been nose-open for her ever since we left. They go off blood.
Ain't all of us gonna make it.
Just realized that, huh?
Six of us left. If we could get through that canyon and lose just one, that'd be quite a fucking feat, huh? A good thing, right?
Not if I'm the one.
Not if I'm the one.
What if you're one of five?
Look, it's hellified stuff -- but no different than those battlefield doctors when they have to decide who lives and who dies. It's called "triage," okay?
Kept calling it "murder" when I did it.
Kept calling it "murder" when I did it.
Either way, figure it's something you can grab onto.

So which one caught your eye?

Don' look, don' look, don' look....
What's her name, anyway?
What do you care?
Then let's not name the Thanksgiving turkey, okay? I assume you still got a shiv.
What, you 'spect <u>me</u> to do it?

What's one more to you? Like <u>this</u> is the one that sends you to Hell?

Oh, you're a piece of art, Johns. They oughtta hang you in a museum somewhere. Or forget the museum -- maybe they should just hang you.
Aw, don't tell me you're growin' scruples.
Just wonderin' if we don't need a bigger piece of chum.
Just wonderin' if we don't need a bigger piece of chum.

Blow-dart hunting stick from Papua New Guinea. Very <u>very</u> rare, since the tribe's extinct.

Well, what's the need, anyway? If he's gone, he's gone. Why should he bother us?
So much for your nightfall.
So much for my cocktail hour.
Amazing how you can do without the essentials of life -- so long as you have the luxuries.
Well, just keep your bloody-fuckin' eyes open. Don't want that ratbag sneakin' up on me bloody-fuckin' arse.
Not a star-jumper.
Doesn't need to be. Use this to get back up to the Sol-Track Shipping Lanes, stick out a thumb. You'll get picked up. Right?
What, you don't really think they left with their clothes on the lines? Photos on the walls?
Maybe they had weight limits, you don't know.
Maybe they had weight limits, you don't know.
I know you don't uncrate your emergency ship unless there's a fucking emergency.
You were tryin' to kill him too.
Just wanted his O-2. Though I notice he tried to ghost my ass. When he shot up that stranger instead.
Take it.
What, it's broken?
What, it's broken?
Startin' to acclimate, anyhow. Take it.
Cornelius, if you have a moment today, I'd like to discuss this expedition of yours in more detail.
Certainly, sir. I'll get my notes and come right over.
Dr. Zaius --
Did you forget our appointment, Cornelius?
Did you forget our appointment, Cornelius?
Oh., no., sir. I was just assembling my notes.
Oh., no., sir. I was just assembling my notes.
You know Dr. Maximus, our Commissioner for Animal Affairs?
You know Dr. Maximus, our Commissioner for Animal Affairs?
Certainly, sir. It's a pleasure to see you again.
He exceeded his orders. His travel permit was promptly revoked.
Yes, sir, so it was -- thanks to you. But not before I discovered evidence of a simian culture that existed long before the Sacred Scrolls were written ...
How did you know we'd come here?
It wasn't difficult. Only an apostate or a lunatic would flee to the Forbidden Zone. I see you brought along the female of your species. I didn't realize a man could be monogamous.
I ask you to reconsider the rash course you've taken. If you're convicted of heresy, the most you'll get is two years. But if you persist in pointing guns in my direction, you'll hang for high treason.
We've never meant to be treasonable, sir. But up there, in the face of that Cliff, is a vast cave -- and in that cave a fabulous treasure of fossils and artifacts.
We've never meant to be treasonable, sir. But up there, in the face of that Cliff, is a vast cave -- and in that cave a fabulous treasure of fossils and artifacts.
I've seen some of your fossils and artifacts. They're worthless.
Indeed, the very fact that these tools are unknown to us could suggest a culture in certain ways almost equal to our own. Some of the evidence is uncontestable ...
Don't speak to me in absolutes. The evidence is contestable.
Don't speak to me in absolutes. The evidence is contestable.
I apologize.
I apologize.
To begin with, your methods of dating the past are crude, to say the least. There are geologists on my staff who would laugh at your speculations.
A doll alone proves nothing. True. But the doll was found beside the jawbone of a man -- and no trace of simian fossils has turned up in this deposit.
Your conclusion is premature. Have you forgotten your Scripture? The Thirteenth Scroll? 'And Proteus brought the upright beast into the garden, and chained him to a tree, and the children made sport of him.'
Your conclusion is premature. Have you forgotten your Scripture? The Thirteenth Scroll? 'And Proteus brought the upright beast into the garden, and chained him to a tree, and the children made sport of him.'
No sir, I haven't forgotten.
No sir, I haven't forgotten.
Well? For a time the ancients kept humans as household pets. Until the Lawgiver proved that man could not be tamed. Keep digging Cornelius. You'll find evidence of the master of this house: an ape.
Seal the cave?
That's correct. And you will both stand trial for heresy.
Well, Taylor -- we're all fugitives now.
Do you have any weapons?
Do you have any weapons?
The best. But we won't need them.
The best. But we won't need them.
Just the same, I want one.
As you wish.
Zaius seems to think there might be another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone. That's what we'll try for. What about you?
To the diggings I worked at a year ago. It's a three day ride across the eastern desert, near where you claim you landed from that planet of yours.
You still don't believe me, do you?
You still don't believe me, do you?
It's a long detour to Dead Lake. What would we find?
Nothing much. The remnants of a life raft. Maybe a small flag. The emblem of my countrymen.
Sorry, Taylor. The terrain around that lake is poisonous. There is no fresh water, no vegetation. Nothing.
Sorry, Taylor. The terrain around that lake is poisonous. There is no fresh water, no vegetation. Nothing.
I know ... Nevertheless, I thank you for saving us. You'll be in trouble for going there.
Where does the river lead?
It empties into a sea some miles from here. That's where the cave is.
You've never told me why this region's called the Forbidden Zone.
No one really knows. It's an ancient taboo. Set forth in the Sacred Scrolls. The Lawgiver pronounced the area deadly.
When are you going to show me what's in the cave?
Right now, if you like.
If there's any shooting, Dr. Zaius, you'll be the first to die. Depend on it.
Taylor, you're not in command here. Put down that gun.
Taylor, you're not in command here. Put down that gun.
Shut up.
Taylor, I'd rather you -
No. You saved me from this fanatic. Maybe I can pay you back.
Yes. I have to agree. From all you've found so far, his position's as good as yours.
What are you doing there?
What are you doing there?
Reconstructing a life. Care to have a look?
That was different. We thought you were .... inferior.
And now you know the truth. Cornelius has beaten you, Doctor. He proved it. Man preceded you here. You owe him your science, your language, whatever knowledge you have.
They can't convict us of that. You proved our innocence. Besides... ... his culture is our culture.
Good luck then.
Do you have to work tonight?
No.
No.
Neither do I.
That's Bright Eyes. The one I was telling you about.
What's so special about him?
What's so special about him?
Watch. Hello, Bright Eyes. How's our throat today?
Look -- she remembers.
Remembers what?
Remembers what?
The blood transfusion.
The blood transfusion.
Zira, come on. You know they can't -- Oh oh. Here comes Number One.
It's a stunt. Humans don't write.
Dear, you're a scientist. Don't you believe your own eyes?
Dear, you're a scientist. Don't you believe your own eyes?
Where did you learn to do this?
Now, just a minute --
Oh, Cornelius, be quiet.
'Dodge was killed in the hunt. What happened to Landon?' I don't know.
And they fell out of the sky with you?
Flight is a scientific impossibility.
And even if it weren't, why fly? Where would it get you?
Cornelius, why do you insist on provoking him?
No creature can survive in that part of the Forbidden Zone. I've been there. I've seen it.
'Then how do you account for me?,
I don't. And I'm not going to try.
I don't. And I'm not going to try.
But what about your theory? The existence of someone like Taylor might prove it.
But what about your theory? The existence of someone like Taylor might prove it.
Zira, are you trying to get my head cut off?
Zira, are you trying to get my head cut off?
Don't be foolish. If it's true, they'll have to accept it.
Don't be foolish. If it's true, they'll have to accept it.
No, they won't -
Cornelius has developed a brilliant hypothesis -
It's probably wrong --
It's probably wrong --
-- that the ape evolved from a lower order of primate, possibly man. In his trip to the Forbidden Zone he discovered traces of a culture older than recorded time -

The evidence was very meager --

You didn't think so then.
You didn't think so then.
That was before Dr. Zaius and half the Academy said the idea was heresy.
That was before Dr. Zaius and half the Academy said the idea was heresy.
How can scientific truth be heresy? What if Taylor is exactly the proof you needed? A mutation. A missing link between the unevolved primate and the ape -
'I am not a missing link.'
Because if he is a missing link, it means the Sacred Scrolls aren't worth their parchment.
Because if he is a missing link, it means the Sacred Scrolls aren't worth their parchment.
Well, maybe they're not.
Well, maybe they're not.
No, thank you'. I won't get into that battle.
No, thank you'. I won't get into that battle.
Oh, Cornelius, show some strength!
Oh, Cornelius, show some strength!
Zira, listen to me. We've got a fine future ahead of us. Marriage. Stimulating careers. I'm up for a raise --
A toy. It floats on the air. Try it.
Zira....
How did it go?
There was one bad moment -- some hunters stopped us.
We'd better get started. If the mounted police pick up our trail, they'll come this far at least.
Right. Let's put the water and provisions in the wagon.
Got your sensors?
Yo!
Yo!
Geiger counter?
Geiger counter?
Yo!
Yo!
One pistol... twenty-four rounds of ammo. two medical kits.. one camera... one TX9. We've enough food and water for three days.

Good question. Landon -- check your communications kit.
Nothing will grow here .... there's just a trace of hydrocarbons, and most of the nitrogen is locked into nitrates.
Any sign of dangerous ionization?
Any sign of dangerous ionization?
No.
No.
Okay. If there's no life here, we've got just seventy-two hours to find it. That's when the groceries run out.
Which direction?
That way.
That way.
Any particular reason?
Any particular reason?
None at all.
Taylor -- quit riding him.
You're more than three hundred light years from your precious planet. Your loved ones have been dead and forgotten for twenty centuries. Even if you could get back, they'd think you were something that fell out of a tree.
Where there's one there's another. And another. And another.
Let's find them all.
Well, at least they haven't tried to bite us.
Blessed are the vegetarians.
Which one was wearing the strange clothes?
Him.
Will he live?
I don't know. This beast lost a lot of blood.
This place is dirty, doctor.
These animals are dirty, doctor. They stink, and they carry communicable diseases. Why aren't they cleaned up before they're brought here?
But the quota system's been abolished! You made it. Why can't I?
What do you mean, made it? I'm an animal psychologist, that's all. We don't have any authority.

They're still dirty. And their bite is septic. Look at that ...
Objection. The accused is indeed a man. Therefore, he has no rights under ape law.
Well, Dr. Zira? This is a man, is he not?
State your case, Mr. Prosecutor.
Learned Judges: My case is simple. It is based on our first Article of Faith: that the Almighty created the ape in his own image; that He gave him a soul and a mind; that He set him apart from the beasts of the jungle, and made him the lord of the planet.
There is a conspiracy afoot to undermine the very cornerstone of our Faith
Come to the point, Dr. Honorius.
Come to the point, Dr. Honorius.
Directly, Mr. President. This wretched man, the accused, is only a pawn in the conspiracy. We know that he was wounded in the throat at the time of his capture. The State charges that Dr. Zira and a corrupt surgeon named Galen experimented on this wounded animal, tampering with his brain and throat tissues to create a speaking monster ...
He can reason? With the Tribunal's permission, let me expose this hoax by direct examination.
Proceed. But don't turn this hearing into a farce.
That's true, Dr. Zaius. My witnesses -- correction -- my exhibits are on display in the amphitheater.
Very well. I suggest we go and look at them.
Objection! These remarks are profane and irrelevant.
Sustained. Your archeological theories have no bearing on the disposition of this creature.
Objection!
Sustained.
Yes, sir. The State charges Doctors Zira and Cornelius with contempt of this Tribunal, malicious mischief and scientific heresy.
Be it so ordered. The Tribunal will examine all the evidence presented here and in due time render a verdict on the proposed indictment and on the disposition of the deviate in question. This hearing is adjourned.
Tell the court, Bright Eyes -- what is the second Article of Faith?
I admit, I know nothing of your culture.
I admit, I know nothing of your culture.
Of course he doesn't know our culture - because he cannot think. Tell us why all apes are created equal.
Of course he doesn't know our culture - because he cannot think. Tell us why all apes are created equal.
Some apes, it seems, are more equal than others.
Some apes, it seems, are more equal than others.
Ridiculous. That answer is a contradiction in terms. Tell us, Bright Eyes, why do men have no souls? What is the proof that a divine spark exists in the simian brain?
Ridiculous. That answer is a contradiction in terms. Tell us, Bright Eyes, why do men have no souls? What is the proof that a divine spark exists in the simian brain?
Show this to the President.
Good morning, Dr. Zira.
Good morning, Julius. How's our patient today?
Good morning, Julius. How's our patient today?
No change. The minute you open the door, he goes into his act.
You could get hurt doing that, Doctor.
Don't be silly. He's perfectly tame.
Awww, it still hurts, doesn't it?
See? He keeps pretending he can talk.
Did you see that? It's remarkable!
Huh?
Huh?
He's trying to form words.
He's trying to form words.
Well, you know what they say. Human see, human do.
What happened?
Those fools and their torches! Do you have any ointment?

Get me a collar and leash. I'm taking him to the infirmary.
He's vicious, Doctor. Besides, it's against the rules.
He's vicious, Doctor. Besides, it's against the rules.
Do as I say.
Landon! Send a last signal.
What signal?
What signal?
To Earth! That we've landed!
It's no use ... there she goes.
Forget it. Abandon ship.
Gone.
We're here to stay.
Well? Where are we? Have any notion, skipper?
We're some three hundred and twenty light years from Earth. On an unnamed planet in orbit around a star in the constellation of Orion. That could be Bellatrix.
Landon! Join the expedition.
Sorry... I was thinking of Stewart. What d'you suppose happened?

Apart from that, you look pretty chipper for a man who's two thousand and thirty one years old. I read the clocks. They bear out Hasslein's hypothesis. We've been away from Earth for two thousand years, give or take a decade. Still can't accept it, huh?
long pause) You know it.

Because time has wiped out everyone and everything you cared for -- they're dust.

Prove it. If we can't get back, it's still just a theory.
Prove it. If we can't get back, it's still just a theory.
It's a fact, Landon. Buy it. You'll sleep better.
If only we could get a fix.
What would you learn? I've told you where you are and when you are.
All right --
There's only one reality left. We're here and it's now. You get ahold of that and hang on tight, or you might as well be dead.
There's only one reality left. We're here and it's now. You get ahold of that and hang on tight, or you might as well be dead.
I'm prepared to die.
Straighten me out on something. Why did you come along at all? You volunteered. Why? I'll tell you. They nominated you for the Big One and you couldn't turn it down. Not without losing your All-American standing
Climb off me, will you!
Climb off me, will you!
And the glory, don't forget that. There's a life-sized bronze statue of you somewhere. It's probably turned green by now, and nobody can read the name plate. But never let it be said we forget our heroes.

Taylor. I'm telling you --
Taylor. I'm telling you --
Oh, and one last item. Immortality. You wanted to go on forever. Well, you damn near made it. Except for Dodge and me, you've lived longer than anybody. And with Stewart dead, it looks like we're the last of the strain. You got what you wanted, kid. How does it taste?
Okay. You read me well enough. Why can't I read you?
Don't bother
Don't bother
Dodge ... he's not like me at all. But he makes sense. Held walk naked into a live volcano if he thought he could learn something no other man knew. I understand why he's here. But you...You're no seeker. You're negative.

But I'm not prepared to die.
I'd like to know why not. You thought life on Earth was meaningless. You despised people. So what did you do? You ran away.
Scarecrows?
Let's take a look.
Can we take a dip?
Okay.
No cigar.
Try telling them our names.
We got off at the wrong stop.
You're our optimist Look at the bright side. If that's the best there is around here, in six months we'll be running this planet.
Who are you?
So you can talk. I'm Dr. Zira's nephew. This abduction was her idea. You're not really going to the zoo. That's just our cover story in case we're stopped. Although I do feel that if it ever came down to a question of whether something like you should be public or private property --

Shouldn't we be moving on?
I'm for that.
Why did you do that? Scrape off your hair?
In my world -- before I left it - only youngsters of your age wore un- scraped hair.
Sorry, Lucius. You'll have to stay here and guard the horses.
Always giving orders. Just like every other adult.
Always giving orders. Just like every other adult.
Relax. You'll see it all later.
Not everything. They left a hostage. How do you feel, Lucius?

They think you're behaving foolishly. I must say I agree. Where will you go?
I'll start by following the shoreline. And my nose.
Lucius.
I think you're making a mistake.
I think you're making a mistake.
That's the boy. Keep 'em flying.
That's the boy. Keep 'em flying.
What?
What?
The flags of discontent. It's the only way anything ever gets changed. Don't try to follow us. I'm pretty handy with things like this.
I told you not to bring the other one.
He wouldn't leave her.
He wouldn't leave her.
All right... Get in...hurry. Put this on.
Gorilla hunters ...
Keep moving. We can't turn back now.
Who put them up?
The Hunt Club.
The Hunt Club.
To scare off humans?
What is that?
A man, Dr. Maximus.
A man, Dr. Maximus.
I know it's a man. And you know the rules. No animals outside the compound, and most certainly not without a leash.
Yes, Sir. But this -- creature is a special case.
Why special?
Why special?
We're -- conducting a new experiment.
You asked for the opportunity to present your case. Surely you must know why you're here.
My own purpose is to save this exceptional creature from mutilation.
My own purpose is to save this exceptional creature from mutilation.
And our purpose is to settle custodial and jurisdictional questions concerning this beast, and determine what's to be done with him.
And our purpose is to settle custodial and jurisdictional questions concerning this beast, and determine what's to be done with him.
At the very least, this man has the right to know whether there's a charge against him.
Dr. Zira -- tell Bright Eyes to sit down.
My name is Taylor.
It says here that his name is Bright Eyes. You gave him that name yourself.
This hearing is absurd! Let me tell my story...
This hearing is absurd! Let me tell my story...
Bailiff! Make the animal be quiet.
One is in a museum!
Dr. Zira! Silence that man!
You destroyed his memory! His mind! His identity! And, you want to do the same to me!
Bailiff! Stop this outburst! Gag that monstrosity!
Let it be clear at the outset that all matters pertaining to this inquiry are confidential, and anyone discussing them outside this chamber will be held in contempt of the Tribunal. You may proceed, Dr. Honorius.
By your leave, Mr. President -- the Tribunal has not yet defined the purpose of this inquiry.
Sustained. In all fairness, Dr. Zira, you must admit the accused is a nonape, and therefore has no rights under ape law.
Then why is he called the accused Your Honors must think him guilty of something.
ThatÕs a lie!
Mind your tongue, madame.
Mind your tongue, madame.
Did we create his mind too? Not only can this man speak. He can write. He can reason.
Since the defendant is forbidden to speak in his own defense, he asks that this statement be read into the record.
Read it yourself.
Read it yourself.
'I have come to you from a planet in a different solar system. I am an explorer in space, with no hostile intentions against your civilization. On my planet it was the primate Man who evolved Into a thinking animal, while the apes remained..."
'I have come to you from a planet in a different solar system. I am an explorer in space, with no hostile intentions against your civilization. On my planet it was the primate Man who evolved Into a thinking animal, while the apes remained..."
Stop right there. Bring me that paper.
This is a joke in very poor taste.
Is it a joke to seek the truth about this man?
How so?
Let us assume, as common sense dictates, that the prisoner's story is false. But if he does not come from another planet, then surely he sprang from our own. Yes, sprang. As an animal psychologist, I have found no physiological defect to explain why humans are mute.
Sustained.
Sustain all objections, but face the truth!
Well...do you acknowledge kinship with any of these creatures?
With one of them.
With one of them.
Identify him, then. Speak to him.
What about me?
Oh, your case was preordained. In a way, you performed a service for the State ... Because your hearing made it possible for us to expose Zira and Cornelius. And now the Tribunal has placed you in my custody for...final disposition. Do you know what that means?

No.
No.
Emasculation, to begin with. Then experimental surgery. On the speech centers. On the brain. Ultimately, a kind of living death.
However, it's within my power to grant You a reprieve. That is why I summoned you here tonight. Tell me who and what you really are and where you come from, and no veterinary will touch you.
I told the truth at that 'hearing'of yours.
I told the truth at that 'hearing'of yours.
You lied. Where is your tribe?
You lied. Where is your tribe?
My tribe, as you call it, lives on another planet in a distant solar system.
My tribe, as you call it, lives on another planet in a distant solar system.
Then how is it we speak the same language? Even in your lies, some truth slips through! That mythical community you're supposed to come from -- Fort Wayne'?
Then how is it we speak the same language? Even in your lies, some truth slips through! That mythical community you're supposed to come from -- Fort Wayne'?
What about it?

A fort! Unconsciously, you chose a name that was belligerent. Where were you nurtured?

I take it you don't believe the prosecutor's charge -- that I'm a monster created by Dr. Zira.
I take it you don't believe the prosecutor's charge -- that I'm a monster created by Dr. Zira.
Certainly not. You're a mutant.
Certainly not. You're a mutant.
That's exactly what Zira and Cornelius claim. You're talking heresy, doctor.
That's exactly what Zira and Cornelius claim. You're talking heresy, doctor.
Of course.
Of course.
All right, suppose I am a mutant? Why does the appearance of one mutant send you into a panic?
All right, suppose I am a mutant? Why does the appearance of one mutant send you into a panic?
Because you're not unique. There was the one you call Landon --
Because you're not unique. There was the one you call Landon --
Then you admit --
Then you admit --
I admit that where there's one mutant there's probably another. And another. A nest of them. Where's your nest, Taylor? Where are your women?
I admit that where there's one mutant there's probably another. And another. A nest of them. Where's your nest, Taylor? Where are your women?
Thank you for calling me Taylor. Dr. Zaius, I know who I am. Who are you? How did this upside down civilization ever get started?
Thank you for calling me Taylor. Dr. Zaius, I know who I am. Who are you? How did this upside down civilization ever get started?
You may well call it upside down, since you occupy its lowest level. And deservedly. The eastern desert has never been explored -- because we've always assumed that no life can exist there. Save yourself, Taylor. Tell me -- is there another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone?

I don't know.
I don't know.
If you are protecting others of your kind, it will cost you your identity.
If you are protecting others of your kind, it will cost you your identity.
I'm not protecting anybody! That hearing was a farce. What have I done?
I'm not protecting anybody! That hearing was a farce. What have I done?
You're a menace! A walking pestilence. I do know who you are, Taylor. As I know that others of your kind must live in the Forbidden Zone. You have just six hours to make a full confession. After that I'll employ surgery to obtain one. Guards!
Stop right there.
Don't be a fool. You're outnumbered and outgunned.
There is no contradiction between faith and science. True science.
All right, let's see if you're willing to put that statement to a test.
What is your proposal?
When were the Sacred Scrolls written?
When were the Sacred Scrolls written?
Twelve hundred years ago.
Twelve hundred years ago.
Very well. If Zira and Cornelius can prove that those scrolls don't tell the whole truth of your history; if they can show you definite evidence of another culture from an unrecorded past -- will you exonerate them?

Of course.
Of course.
Okay.Up to the cave.
I don't say he was a man like an Earthman, but I'd call him a close relative, for he was plagued by most of man's ills. Yet, fragile as he was, he came before you -- and was superior to you.
That's lunacy. I can give an alternate description for everyone of those objects that's equally as inventive as yours. But it would be conjecture, not proof.
Tell him to pull back!
Cease fire! Withdraw!
Then answer this: If ran was superior, why didn't he survive?
He might have been wiped out by a plague. Natural catastrophe. Like a fiery storm of meteors. From the looks of this part of your planet, I'd say that was a fair bet.
Then there is another jungle?
Of course, you could return with us. Our society might find a place for you and your mate.
Of course, you could return with us. Our society might find a place for you and your mate.
Sure. In a cage.
Sure. In a cage.
Where else, but in a cage, does man belong?
Where else, but in a cage, does man belong?
No, thanks. I'll take freedom.
Why? From the first, I've terrified you, Doctor. And in spite of every sign that I'm an intelligent being who means no harm, you continue to hate and fear me. Why?
Because you are a man. And you were right -- I have always known about man. From the evidence, I believe his wisdom must walk hand in hand with his idiocy. His emotions must rule his brain. He must be a warlike animal who gives battle to everything around him -- even himself.

What evidence? No weapons were found in the cave.

We're back at the beginning. I still don't know the why. A planet where apes evolved from men. A world turned wrong side up. A puzzle with one piece missing.
We're back at the beginning. I still don't know the why. A planet where apes evolved from men. A world turned wrong side up. A puzzle with one piece missing.
Don't look for it, Taylor. You may not like what you find.
Well, Bright Eyes, is our throat feeling better?
Listen, listen -- I can speak --
Speak! Go on. Speak again.
My - name - isn't - Bright Eyes It's Taylor!
My - name - isn't - Bright Eyes It's Taylor!
There! Can you believe it? I looks like he's talking.
I'm not acting! I can talk! How much proof do you want?
Dr. Zaius, I could have sworn he was answering you!
Where have you been? Why didn't you come to see me?
Shhhh!
Shhhh!
What is this?
What is this?
A hearing.
It's him...Landon.
Which one?
Which one?
Second from the left.
You! ... You knew about this?
No, I swear -- I never saw this man before.
No, I swear -- I never saw this man before.
You did this to him! You've removed his frontal lobes!
Listen-
Taylor -- just keep quiet and we may get away with this. Remember that men all look alike to most apes.
Cornelius and I have been indicted for heresy. Unless we can prove our theories, we don't stand a chance of acquittal.
You're going back to the Forbidden Zone?
Are you going to take her with you?
Yes.
Yes.
Actually, you're a different breed. This creature will never evolve.
Actually, you're a different breed. This creature will never evolve.
Maybe not.
Maybe not.
You want her that much?
You want her that much?
You threw us together, remember? And you guessed right. Men, like apes, get despondent without a mate.
What's the diagnosis, doctor? A touch of the sun?
She's not sick at all. She's pregnant.
And that's your Minister of Science. Honor- bound to expand the frontiers of knowledge.
Taylor, please --
Taylor, please --
Except that he's also the Chief Defender of the Faith.
Taylor! Tell him.
He has a point. On my planet children often play with ape dolls.
Then tell them Dr. Zaius won't leave here alive.
Taylor, you can't.
Taylor, please -- don't treat him that way.
Why not?
Why not?
It's humiliating.
It's humiliating.
Wasn't I humiliated? By all of you? Didn't you lead me around on a leash?
Would you like to come along?
We can't.
We can't.
It's better than going to prison for heresy.
Dr. Zira, I'd like to kiss you good-bye.
All right, but.... ...you're so damned ugly!
Go with God, Taylor. That's an old expression. it comes from both ape and man.
God bless you.
He's moving his fingers!
Of course. He saw you moving yours.
Of course. He saw you moving yours.
But perhaps he understood --
Wouldn't it more properly be done in your office?
Yes, Sir.
Dr. Zira -- you state here that a ship from outer space sank in an inland sea of our eastern desert.
I do not state it, sir. The prisoner does.
I do not state it, sir. The prisoner does.
Do you believe him?
Do you believe him?
Like you, I find it difficult.
Like you, I find it difficult.
But how convenient that the proof of his arrival has vanished? You also state that Bright Eyes had two intelligent companions at the time of his capture.
But how convenient that the proof of his arrival has vanished? You also state that Bright Eyes had two intelligent companions at the time of his capture.
This is his assertion.
This is his assertion.
Where are they now?
How sad. Stuffed and mounted, eh? Dead men, like sunken ships, can tell no stories. And his other companion?
He doesn't know.
He doesn't know.
Mr. President, I believe the Prosecutor has reassembled all he surviving humans captured in the hunt along with Bright Eyes.
Let them talk, Mr President. Let them talk.
Sirs: our theories have a bearing on his identity.
Secondly, if these 'tools' as you call them, are unidentified, why are they introduced as 'evidence' of anything?
But there's the doll, sir.
But there's the doll, sir.
What?
But suppose you find nothing but a wasteland. How will you survive?
He won't survive. Do you know what sort of life awaits you out there, Taylor? That of an animal. If you aren't eventually hunted down and killed by apes, some jungle beast will devour you.
But the proof? The doll?
In a few minutes there will be no doll. There can't be. I'm sorry.
Bunker...
Where?
...but 'Lias is still out there.
I'll get him. You get the man in, Taylor NOW. Or I'll Article 15 both your asses. Move!

Barnes, listen to me... there's 5-6 spiderholes back there next to the church. Third Platoon's coming up the stream to reinforce us. Flank's wide open, dinks get 3-4 snipers in these holes, when Third Platoon comes up, they'll get us in a crossfire with 'em. We'll shoot each other to shit, then they'll hit us with everything they got. It'll be a massacre!
...You keep pouring out that suppressing fire, Barnes. I don't wanna be caught out there with my ass hanging out you hear me?
Don't tell me how to fight this fucking war, 'Lias, you go crying to fucking brigade on your time. Out here you belong to me. Now move.
We got boo-coo movement. 3rd Battalion just got hit 15 kliks north of here.
Yeah, they had claymores strung up in the trees, blew a whole fucking platoon to pieces. BAAD SHIT.
So what's the problem?
Says he can't walk.
Says he can't walk.
Shit. Get your boots on Martin, next time I catch you putting mosquito repellent on your fuckin' feet I'm gonna courtmartial your nigger ass.

Fuck you Elias.
Excuses are like assholes, Taylor - everybody got one.

Tell Six we need engineers here, this pos. is crawling with traps.
They're on their way... There's a gook village half a klik downriver, Battalion wants us to move in and search it ASAP, something's going on... where's Barnes?
Alright, Six says torch this place! Blow the weapons in place. Round up all suspected Vee Cees and shake it up! We ain't got much light left.

Sounds pretty far out to me 'Lias.
Maybe but I seen it happen at Ia Drang in '66, First Cavalry and they cut us to fuckin' pieces! Give me three men, if I'm wrong, I can still roll up that flank.
Whatcha doing in the underworld Taylor?

I know Barnes six months and I'll tell ya something - that man is MEAN, red in his soul like a dick on a dog.
Barnes gets killed, his jaws'd go on clacking...
He done a year in Japan in the hospital, then when he gets out, the first thing he done is re-up. Four years he been in the field...
...and you know how many times he done been shot? Seven times! Seven.
The Good Lord works his revenge in strange ways.
Yeah, you done said it. Revenge on US.
Not the only man to meet his Jezebel either.
So he got a reduced and come over here. Nam's his freedom man, Nam's his pussy. Three years he been here.
Then you jes gonna forget 'bout Elias and all the good times we done had? Right in here.
He dugged his own grave.
Right on.
I remember first time you came in here Taylor you telling me how much you admired that bastard.
And Baaaaaaa! back on you.
If you're gonna do it man, 'least do it right.
I didn't like it.
Bah, you're a child, Lerner. Rhah don't waste time on you.
Tennessee someplace. Hill country.
Barnes took a bullet right there. At Ia Drang Valley... And the cocksucker SURVIVED - that's BAAAD man. That's his high, baby. High on WAR!
Well he ain't normal that's fo sure.
That's what he is... Baaaa!
I was home on leave y'know and everybody's just worried 'bout making money, everybody's out for themselves, they don't even want to talk about it man, it's like the fucking Twilight Zone back there - you wouldn't even KNOW there's a war on here. My sister says to me why you have to go there like I started this...
Baaaa! Fuck it, they sold us out - so what! What'd you'all expect? Civilian life is phoney BULLSHIT man. They're ROBOTS man - watchin' dopey television and drivin' dopey cars, and they fuck up, nobody dies. That's all right, you keep fuckin' up, politicians keep lyin'. Cause it don't really matter. Don't mean shit. So what! Whatcha want - a parade! Fuck that too!

This is one time we could sure use Elias.
No thanks, I've seen Seattle.
My name's Larry Mitchell. I live in Vancouver.
Same as an hour ago. Remember? I'm the steady type.
I'm afraid there's nothing I can do about it, Mr. Mitchell.

I'm supposing.
I think you're a nice girl. I like you. But I can read signs if the print is large enough. It was your manner more than the wedding ring that bothered the inspector. A sort of tenseness, as if you were afraid of something.
I have a darned good idea you're name isn't Betty Mayfield at all.
Yes?
Yes?
How about taking to Uncle Larry into the old firm? He's a useful guy to have on your side.

Perhaps I'd better get you straightened out, Mr. Mitchell. You've been rather nice to me, in a couple of ways. And I'm grateful. But I don't think this entitles you to put me on a leash.

Betty, this is Margo West. She wants to meet you. Miss Mayfield.
How do you do?
I think I'd like to dance.
Why certainly, baby.
Please be a little more careful how you talk, Mr. Mitchell.
How careful should I be?

I don't like being referred to as babe, or addressed as baby. I don't like your possessive attitude, nor your hints of secret knowledge. In fact, to be very frank, Mr. Mitchell, I don't think I like you.

I think you're drunk.
Just drunk enough.
What's the matter, baby? Don't you like being kissed?
Next time you try that, Mr. Mitchell... ..don't. I'm warning you.
Good evening, Miss.
How soon can I get a plane to Seattle?

Crossing the border this time of night they're a bit particular. You'd have to prove your identity, you know... unless you've got a passport. They might even want to know why you're in such a hurry. Otherwise they might think...
They might think I was running away from something.
Possibly, Miss.
Good morning. Can I do something for you?
I'm Miss Mayfield. Is Mr. Campbell here?

You can have the table yourself, if you'd rather. I'm only killing time.
No, please.
No, please.
Sit down then. We often have a double up here.
Sit down then. We often have a double up here.
I see.
Your liquor laws..
Disgusting, aren't they? If you really want a Martini, I know where you can get one.
A fellow named Brandon has a penthouse here. He's holding open house. I was up there. Too noisy. Bored.
I see.
I see.
It might be worth a Martini to you.

As I said before...
As I said before...
Sure. But I'd hate like the Dickens to be held to everything I've said before, wouldn't you?
You're not paying for this. It's quite enough that you let me sit at your table.
I never pay for anything. They just keep me here to amuse the guests.

I hate to be alone. But I've heard all the approaches there are... even yours.
Neatly said...but to the wrong man. The trouble with pretty girls is that they can't imagine anyone thinking of anything else but the fact they are pretty girls. I get tired of it.
Do you think I don't?

Thanks for the fresh air. That felt good.

He doesn't even know half the people who come up to drink his liquor.
Dance?
No thank you.
I know it's a littler late for an apology.
Much too late.
Much too late.
Don't take it so big... it isn't a tragedy.
You said it wasn't a tragedy.
What's funny about that? If you pick up people like Larry Mitchell other people are bound to get funny ideas about you. The world is full of Larry Mitchells.

There's one less tonight.
There isn't one.. That anyone would believe. I went for a walk after dinner, down to the ocean...alone... I came up and went to bed. I didn't sleep very well. Then there was a thunderstorm. And it began to rain. I went across to close the French door. That's the first time I saw him out there.
He got in here how?
He got in here how?
Not with my consent, strange as it seems. I don't know how he got in. I don't know anything.
No. And I've never fired a gun in my life, Aren't you supposed not to touch it?
Sure... but somebody always does..
They'll know whether he killed himself.
I don't.
I don't.
How did you meet him?

On a train. He said he lived here, and he offered to make a reservation for me.

Go ahead...if you want to. It doesn't matter.
I'd rather wait until it does matter.
You tried to run away.
There wasn't any plane.
There wasn't any plane.
It's always a mistake to run away. Always.
Want a spike in it?
No thanks.
There's one thing I may as well tell you. You'll find it out anyhow. I tried to run away--when I found him out there on the balcony. There wasn't any plane.
You didn't have to tell him that.
Bad?
Bad enough.
Bad enough.
He could hardly help suspecting you.

Couldn't be.

Then he's--
Quite sure you saw him in the hotel lobby?
Absolutely sure.

We'll find out.
He's a fellow with a very hard knee, and he knows how to use it.
You don't know who he is?

It still doesn't matter if I kiss you?
Nothing matters.
Nothing matters.
No use waiting, then.
That's the second round I've lost tonight. That fellow hurt me.
So have I.
So have I.
From you, I like it.
It sounds like a fair location. Could you be a little more exact?
I'm in the Hudson Bay Company's store. That man last night--the one that followed me--
I'm in the Hudson Bay Company's store. That man last night--the one that followed me--
I don't think that's on the market anymore. I'd like something much closer to the water.
Cant be too close for me. Right across the street from it suits me. Anything else listed?
There's another man--right outside the booth here. I never saw him Before.
There's another man--right outside the booth here. I never saw him Before.
You're probably mistaken about that. Let's get together sand talk it over. There's always a solution to these problems. But it must be near the water. Quite near-- Yes, if you don't mind waiting.
I hated to go to that place. I almost went to the police station instead.
No percentage in that.

They're going to arrest me.
They're going to arrest me.
I know. Killaine has a warrant.
I know. Killaine has a warrant.
I have my own warrant. Stop a minute, please.
If you meant it, you wouldn't show it to me, Betty. Or am I supposed to deliver it to dear Inspector Killaine?
Wrote it in the waiting room of the Hudson Bay Store. With somebody's Pekingese trying to climb into my lap. Perhaps you're right. Perhaps I didn't mean it. All I know is that I'm licked.

There's a lot of water between Vancouver and the U.S.A. This note is a suicide note. After you're gone where would they look for you? Why would they look for you? Darkness, and open water, and a fast cabin cruiser. And I have a pocket full of money. And if I helped you, I'd be committing a crime, or so they tell me.

How bad is it? Bad enough for--

Yes. I've never been very far from it, for a long time. Will you do something for me?
Take me where I haven't the courage to take myself.
How bad is the other thing? The secret?

I was tried for murdering my husband. Guilty. The judge set the verdict aside. There was one man on the jury-- --but he was afraid. They were all afraid--of my father-in-law. That man followed me last night-- he came from him of course. My father-in-law will never give up. Never. He promised me that. So I came to Vancouver, B.C. As far away as
This is the ace, Betty. But not of spades. They'll find out about the other. They might know already. And when they get this-- What would they look for? Where? Out there somewhere?
They'll look for you.
They'll look for you.
I run over to Victoria. Play some golf with some people I know. Do it all the time. That's why I have a cabin cruiser. Custom- built.Forty knots.

Blonde, beautiful, and sad--and nowhere. Of course she might have run away--if she knew how. And where to go. She might have dyed her hair. Bleached it before probably. And changed her name again.

If they had any reason to. Why make it tough for themselves? Why go to all that trouble? Here's an open book. Close it. No reason to keep it open. She was a nice girl, anyway.

The best interference runner we've got. He thinks he's in love with you--and he's a gentleman. Come here, baby.

You wouldn't like it. I've been there.

My father died in jail, and he was twice the man I am.
Well?
You leave it.
Killaine's wise. We can't wait any longer. Here, put this on. But stay out of sight until we clear the harbor. I'll tell you when.
Killaine's wise to what?
See anything?
I can still see the shoreline. The moon is rising.

Go down into the cabin and get yourself a drink. Careful how you go, we're hitting the swell now.

Nobody believed I wasn't in on it. I was just a dumb-smart collage boy, and he was my father. I thought it was a legitimate business. He was a politician, with fingers in a lot of pies. I never saw the pies. They had names. For the record. Innocent names. You know where that kind of money comes from, don't you?

The money that makes you Mr. Clark Brandon. Let's you live in a penthouse, on top of the Vancouver Royal. Lets you own a cruiser. Lets you do as you please, go where you please. You big, open-handed, generous guy. That's the kind of money it takes, isn't it?
It buys things, just like any other kind.
That man that was following us last night--he didn't come back this morning. I'm beginning to wonder about him, too. Was he really following me--or you?

I'm still on course to Victoria. Nobody saw you get on board, nobody seen you since.
It wasn't the time or place. Don't worry about the note, baby. I'm playing for my neck now.
And I'm begging for my life--and yours.

Yes. Yours. You haven't murdered anybody. You killed Mitchell. Wasn't that an accident? It must have been. If you kill a blackmailer, you kill him dead--so that he can't talk anymore.

But the next one is murder. First the little step, then the longer step , and then the step you can never take back. You could tell about Mitchell. You could tell about Magruder--and the detective. It would hurt, but you could do it. You could never tell about me.

If it has to be--do you mind if I do it myself? Oh, I don't mean with the gun. This is no trick. When I wrote that note you have in your pocket-- that was no trick either. It's not so hard for me as you think. I'm not crying about it, I've been skating close to it for quite some time. The water

You probably know the type. You find them in hotels and resorts all over the world. They always have clothes, and money, and usually have had three or four husbands.

Miss Mayfield, the humor of the situation escapes me. Within 24 hours I shall know officially whether Mitchell was murdered. Privately, I'm quite sure of it now. It happened in your room, and you came to Vancouver with him.. At any rate, he made your hotel reservation.. And you arrived together. Here in this room he behaved nastily to you, and you said something

Good morning, Mr. Killaine. I'm sorry I can't give you the name of my bank--because I have no bank at the moment. That was a crude trick.
They're all crude, when they don't work. Had breakfast?

I'm about to be very silly. A man passes a girl on the street--a very lovely girl--his eyes meet her eyes, and something reaches out and takes hold of his heart-- and then she goes on and is lost in the crowd--and he says to himself, "There goes my lost love"-- and it's true--if he never sees her again, it's still true. Of course,

How are you two getting along?
Delightfully. Every time Miss Mayfield says something, I know less than I did before. Well, I may as well knock off for tonight. Good night, Miss Mayfield. Do let me thank you for your cooperation.
In case you want to have us followed.
I don't.

Your concentrating too hard, Killaine. What about Margo West? She had a motive. I guess you know by this time whose gun it was?
And old man Clarendon? He had a motive, too. Margo and her money.
Mitchell was killed down here. How could Clarendon get in to do it? Or Margo for that matter.

She didn't have to. He could have climbed down from here.
Mitchell was too drunk.
Or just drunk enough. He was with her when she registered. He knew where her room was. You were out most of the evening. There was a lot of mess to clean up . Waiters coming and going, the door standing open. Suppose Mitchell came in to grab a drink for himself, then wandered out on this balcony, then realized betty's balcony was just

You don't buy it. Okay. So I still want Betty Mayfield. Where is she?
You don't buy it. Okay. So I still want Betty Mayfield. Where is she?
No idea.
No more for me, thanks. Remember what I said. I can't interfere with the law.
Where would she go, anyway. Don't tell me you haven't got her covered.
You forgetting the gag line, Killaine. The police don't take anything for granted.
I'm afraid they do. Far too often. So long.

Wait a minute. I'll go with you.
You do a lot of real estate trading, Brandon?
Now and then. Mostly just for the fun of it.

Where did it all come from? Or is that a permissible question?
I had a father who knew how to steal.
What?
What?
You asked me where it all came from.
You asked me where it all came from.
Oh. That was just one of those idle questions. One doesn't expect an answer.
Hello, Mitchell. Having fun?
The liquors lovely. The rest of the party you can have.
What's the matter, baby. Don't you like me anymore?
Lay off, can't you?
Lay off, can't you?
Lay off what? This is my new girl friend. Met her on the train. She's very fond of me. Love at first sight. Wasn't it, baby?
Do me a favor, Mitchell. Find yourself a nice secluded park bench.
Did I do something wrong?
Did I do something wrong?
I wouldn't know. Just do it somewhere else. There is such a thing as good manners.

Want to walk out... or get thrown out?

You don't throw guests out, Brandon.

Don't bet on it. I'm eccentric.
Good afternoon, Mr. Campbell.
Mr. Mitchell.
Mr. Mitchell.
A little something on account perhaps?

Rather more than a little something, Mr. Mitchell.
Rather more than a little something, Mr. Mitchell.
I'm afraid this is all for the moment.
I think we'd better discuss this in my office, Mr. Mitchell.
Nothing to discuss. Tomorrow the sun will shine even brighter. Be grateful for small mercies.
I'm getting positively haggard. In a couple of years people will be describing me as well preserved.
I see out friend Larry Mitchell is with us again.
So much less refined than frizzling them in the chair.
Oh, shut up! You haven't even got your spats on.
What are you doing here?
I don't think you locked your door.
I don't think you locked your door.
What do you want?
What do you want?
See how easy it is? Perhaps Miss Mayfield left her door unlocked. Or if she didn't, there's a passkey on every floor in the linen room. The head porter has a passkey. The bell captain has a passkey. The hotel's full of passkeys.

Or--since one is a well-known and respected guest--one could go to the desk in the lobby and say "Miss Mayfield seems to have lost her room key--have you another"? They always have another.

You nasty, sardonic--
You nasty, sardonic--
Sardonic, if you will my dear. Bust nasty. You lied about the gun.
I'm a very observant man. You had something in your bag this afternoon, Something that causes you to hold it in a particular way. Something that made a particular sound when you put it down on the bar. You went out with Mitchell. None of us ever saw him again.
That's not enough.
That's not enough.
I saw your face this evening when the detective showed you the gun. You lied. It was obvious.

He was very easy to hate. If you'll look in your mirror, when you are in a better temper- you'll know why.
Mr. Clarendon, have you ever seen this before?
I'm sorry, Inspector, I don't know much about..
I'm sorry, Inspector, I don't know much about..
Recently, then.
Recently, then.
No, Not recently. I'm sure of that.
No, Not recently. I'm sure of that.
Thank you.
I needn't keep you any longer, Mr. Clarendon.
Thank you. It is rather late... and I'm not young anymore. Good night.
The Harbor police have just picked up a dead man out of the water.
Floater?

Got a moment, Inspector?
I've got a year. Or a second. I'm not sure which.
I've got a year. Or a second. I'm not sure which.
You told me when we'd identified this fellow--
We've done that. He's a San Francisco private eye. Name Martin J. Goble, G-O-B-L-E. Had initials in his hat and for once he lived where he bought it. Goble and Greer is the firm name.
Swimming with his hat on? That's original.

I got through to Greer, his partner in the detective business. Greer won't give out.
I'd suggest a telegram. Something like this: Chief of Police, San Francisco. A licensed private detective named named Martin J.

Refuses information necessary to our investigation. Can you assist? Signed Detective Sergeant Driscoll, Vancouver, British Columbia, Police.

If you're asking my opinion, no. I'd read it to Greer over the phone. Ask him if he had any objections.
Catch me at the Vancouver Royal if it's important.
How important would it have to be? It's only murder, Inspector.
The Super's just given me the sweetest dressing down I've ever had. I'm still reeling from it. And believe me, I had it coming. I apologize. What you think is important--I think is important.
Thanks, Inspector. What are your orders about this wire to San Francisco?
Thanks, Inspector. What are your orders about this wire to San Francisco?
Men like you don't need orders.
What's the face for, Driscoll?
Magruder's conked out. Adrenaline injections, oxygen tent. He may come out of it and he may not. As a source of quick information, we can't forget him.

Go live in a tent.

You in charge here?
So it seems Sergeant.

Right.
Right.
I hate to pull rank on you Sergeant, but once in a while...for moral purposes...you might address me as "Inspector". In moments of extreme desperation, you might even call me "sir".
I knew him. He was easy to dislike, poor chap.
They tell me he'll be a great loss to the liquor trade. This Mayfield girl...
... I supposed you knew her, too, Inspector.
I've met her.
I've met her.
It's her room. She only got to the Hotel this afternoon,. With him. I guess he took too much for granted. Here's the gun.
Pearl-handled .25 Automatic, uh? No, it's a Belgian gun... 6.6 mm.
Correct, Inspector. A woman's gun. U.S. 125 caliber ammunition in it. It was on a table in there.
This make of gun throws a shell backwards, high, and to the right. The chaise is only about four feet from the wall.
So the shell ought to have gone over?

I've always looked forward to it. All right, let's get him out of here and tidy up.
She didn't seem the type to lam out--even if she got the chance. That stuff was all gone through last night. Anything special you're looking for, Inspector?
I'll know when I find it.
I'll know when I find it.
I guess I'm just ballast around here.
"G.G. Market one-eight-four-two."
Gigi, huh? Sounds French--one of those fancy ladies. Must have been very fancy, if he scratched her phone number in gold.

Market... It seems to me that's a San Francisco exchange.
That's pretty risky business, Inspector.
Somebody did it twice last night-- in the dark.
Not too hard, is it?
Maybe we've been pretty dumb--

There wasn't any motive...let's try out the act.

If I've got any sense I'm going to call headquarters.

They'll probably believe you. But they'll want to know what you were fighting about. Why Mitchell had a gun. You'll tell them a simple story. They'll pretend it sounds all right to them. Now you're headquarters. How does it sound to you?

I've got to find a way to handle it, openly. Like Brandon.
How did he know he'd get the chance? He couldn't have arranged it.
He could have tried. If he was up there in the dark, listening, he'd know when she came home, know when she found Mitchell dead, know what she did about it. If she telephoned, he'd probably hear that.

Did we ever really think it was suicide?

You win, Inspector. You win all along the line. Why didn't we think of Brandon before--or did we-- some of us. Yeah. Of course you did. When a suspect thinks he's safe, you go on letting him think he's safe. Wait for a mistake.

Greer and Goble in the Call Building, San Francisco. Just like you thought...Two murders in two days. Different places, different methods, different people. Nothing connects them, but a telephone number.
A think wire---but very, very strong. Let's get out of here.
Oh, the Coldstream Guards. Don't you take your hat off in elevators?
I never wear a hat. Oh, so I am. I forgot. I guess I'm terribly sorry again, Mrs. West.
May you what?
Oh nothing.
Oh nothing.
Are you always this witty?
Scotch and plain water, I think.
Warm water, no doubt.
I never saw it before.
Positive?
What about me?
Not quiet yet.
You knew Mitchell pretty well, didn't you, Mrs. West?
I was in love with him... which shows you the quality of my brains. Why don't you ask her about the gun?

Yes--and he's already becoming vague to me. Funny! Last night I was furiously jealous. Jealous of what? I out that gun in my bag deliberately. Who was I going to kill with it? A girl I didn't even know? A man I knew to be a thief and a forger? A half-man? A gigolo? It's already ludicrous. Love! What a comedy!

Yes, I think so. Here are two glazed manila envelopes. One is the bag type. The other one had the money in it. Don't ask me how I know. I know.
I'm interested in who handled it.
I'm interested in who handled it.
Four different people, Inspector. Three men and a women. I've made slides for two. They handled both envelopes.
No doubt about that one.

Killaine, this is Mr. Mitchell, Senior. Young Mitchell's father. He just flew in from Toronto.
How do you do, sir.
I've explained the situation to Mr. Mitchell up to a point. Now about this Mayfield girl?
She's a suspect, naturally. But not the only one.
She's a suspect, naturally. But not the only one.
She's the only one who had a dead man in her room. The only one who won't give an account of herself. The only one who tried to run away. And the only one, so far, I've been told, who went to such lengths to disguise her identity that she even removed the labels from her clothes. What more do you want?
No.
I hear she's a very pretty girl.

Aye. You have a point there.
Am I to interpret that as an order to arrest Miss Mayfield?
When I give an order, you'll not need it interpreted. You have an hour to make your mind up. Well, are ye satisfied, Mr. Mitchell?
Are you a policeman or a soft-headed nincompoop?
A little of both, sir, and perhaps not quiet enough of either.

This badge is not an old newspaper you can cast down on the desk. It is not a thing you can give up as of no value. It may be taken from you--and you may die defending it. But you'll not use it to make cheap dramatic gesures with. It's a naked steel of the sword of Justice. Put it back in your pocket
Get out of here!
What are my orders, sir?

You think I'm wrong about this bit of a girl. Go out and prove it against me!
I'm afraid you're not very glad to see me, Margo.
With your charm? How could I help it? Have a nice trip?

She's just a girl I met on the train. You don't mind do you?

You shouldn't. You washed me up very thoroughly.

As thoroughly as I could. It wasn't easy. But you are helping me.

Margo, darling. You washed me up. Remember? We're just friends. You wanted it that way.

She's very beautiful. She's much younger than I am. And she's rich, I hope.

Rich? I haven't the faintest idea. Why?
Rich? I haven't the faintest idea. Why?
You ought to know why.
You ought to know why.
I don't. My hunch is she's just torn up an unhappy marriage. I was able to do her a small favor.
I don't. My hunch is she's just torn up an unhappy marriage. I was able to do her a small favor.
Splendid. Now she can return the compliment.
I hoped to get enough to cover them before they cleared. I wasn't lucky.
You know what would happen to you if I turned these over to the police?

You'd go to jail. For a long term.

Correct. I couldn't even afford to pay a lawyer to defend me.
What'll we do about it, Margo?
She is much younger than I am. That's something I'm going to have to get used to. Isn't it, Larry? They'll all be much younger than I am. Here. Tear them up.
I've always been a heel. I guess I always will be.
You don't have to make a pose of it.

I seem to recognize this routine. First the kiss then the touch. Oh, what's the use. You're you.
I seem to remember that you like to help yourself.
That's not very kind.

In that case, there's someone here I'd like to introduce to you. Over there.
She is beautiful. And young. No thank you.
I say YES!
You're very attractive, my dear. And you look very unsophisticated.
Unsophisticated? If I knew about this babe...
Mr. Penfield. I am sorry to have kept you.
It's kind of you to see me.
It's kind of you to see me.
Tom, Daddy would like to see you in the garden. And will you ask Betty to bring us some coffee. And remember to say 'please'.
He's a little unhappy. I hope he wasn't a nuisance?
He was delightful.
My first husband worked for the BBC. I doubt if anyone there remembers him now, just another long dead diligent administrator. He would have been useful in the fight to preserve the BBC's independence during the Suez crisis - one of the few things he was passionate about. I became involved too. I started work on a book that would have been published on
What a shame.
What a shame.
It wasn't much more than a pot boiler.Suez was very important for our generation. I didn't want it to be forgotten. And that's why I'd like to be able to help you. But really Mr. Penfield, I looked through my notes before you came, they're all very much out of date, there's been so much published since. I don't think I'm your man.

Well, I am a great admirer of your work. I read your books on Chartism when I was still at school. I'm a journalist, not a historian. There are questions of method, and approach. I wondered--

I see. Are you a socialist, Mr. Penfield?

Yes.
Yes.
Good. Suez was a minefield for both parties.
My husband apologises for not joining us. It's not too cold for you, Mr. Penfield?
It's fine, thank you.
It's fine, thank you.
Since you are a friend of my daughter's, I think I'm entitled to call you James, don't you think?

To James. I remember what it was I was going to say. We were talking about forgetfulness. The Czech writer Kundera has one of his characters say that the struggle of man against tyranny is the struggle of memory against forgetting.

History books are first onto the bonfires.
History books are first onto the bonfires.
If we leave the remembering to historians then the struggle is already lost. Everyone must have a memory, everyone needs to be a historian. In this country, for example, we're in danger of losing hard-won freedoms by dozing off in a perpetual present.
Here I am lecturing you. Have some pâté.
Thanks.
So I can go ahead and be a historian without feeling like a poseur.I shall be fulfilling a citizen's duty.
If you like. But don't be too modest, James. The citizen's duty is to remember, not necessarily to write books. You are highly qualified. You're a responsible journalist doing what sounds to me like a very demanding job. Every day you take decisions that depend on your sense of history. A genuine tyranny would have to get rid of people like you.

Actually, we've only just met. But we're quiet good friends.

She'll be here next weekend. Why don't you come too, James? I'll * show you the marshes properly. If you're lucky you might even see the first of the geese arriving from Siberia.

Don't be silly. I'll look out some more Suez material for you. You'll be very welcome.

We'll see you next week, and if--

Hello. Anyone for a walk? Tom isn't, I can tell you.
Well, we were just...
Shall we go?
Yes.
Then I began to listen to what the well-off were saying about the poor now  the war had just ended, and the language was much the same as it had been before the first Reform Act. A small minority thought that England was really theirs, they had made it, they owned it. The rest, the wage earners, were foreigners, outsiders intent on wrecking

What went wrong?
What went wrong?
Oh, many things. Inertia ... Stalin and the Cold War... a failure of nerve. We took the seediest, most inefficient fifth of the economy into State care, paid out millions for it, put the same old duffers in charge. A new broom with very old bristles. When the Tories were returned, I went and sat in the BM and wrote my little book on

This is Jill, Carol, Betty, Mandy, Louise, Pete over there, and I'm Carmen.
But I'm not an interviewer or a correspondent.
That doesn't matter. As long as we can get our message through to someone there. Jill, where are those handouts?
Give them here. This tells you how the Women's Peace Camp came to be set up. All local women at first, then we had support from women and men all over the country.
Very good.
Terrific.
But what we need is national coverage. It's difficult with this Falklands madness going on. Do you think you might be able to do something when you get back?

I'll suggest it. Remember though, we're news, not features. It might help if you could get yourselves attacked by the police. Anyway, I'll be back with this soon. Thanks.
Charles! I didn't know you were back. Have a good holiday?
Not too bad, thanks. How have you been?

Aha. James giving some woman the old heave-ho.
Exactly that.

Congratulations. Who with?
A glamorous young lady way above his station...
I know, I know! Gentlemen, let me introduce you to one of our most talented contributors to The Cold War. James Penfield. He wrote the opening chapter, on 'The Berlin Airlift'. One of the best chapters in the book.
Hello.
Hello.
I won't introduce you all by name. Basically James, this is our UK sales team. What was I saying? Yes, these graduate trainees...
Would you like a dessert...I'm having one.
No thanks. I'd like to break away--
No thanks. I'd like to break away--
I'll have some of that.
I'll have some of that.

And some of that. Sorry.
And some of that. Sorry.
...from all the moralising and talk of national humiliation that is now the standard line on Suez...
Yes...You're not a socialist then?
No. I'd want to--
No. I'd want to--
Good.
Good.
I'd want to set out events as they happened. The way I see it is this: the British Empire was an ideal. It may have become totally obsolete by the middle of this century, but it wasn't totally dishonourable to try and defend its remains and try and salvage some self-respect, which is what I think the Conservatives were trying to do. Then there's

Personally James, I'm very excited by this new arrangement we have. It gives us direct access to literally hundreds of American collages. Twentieth century history is a growth area over there, don't ask me why. Your readership will be first and second year American collage students...
Freshman and sophomores...

You know the lingo. Jolly good. So your language will have to be simple, not stupid, mind, but simple, very, very simple, and always remember it's an American readership.

Like I was saying, the American angle in Suez is very important. I wouldn't want to say they let us down. I think that's wrong. A good ally is one who doesn't back you up in your mistakes, who tells you when to pull back. And the Americans were good allies. Simple as that.
James... I can't begin to tell you how pleased we all are. Congratulations, and I really mean it.
Thank you.
Thank you.
It's everything we wanted. A very good read. A terrific piece of work. So, here's to you and Suez.
It's everything we wanted. A very good read. A terrific piece of work. So, here's to you and Suez.
And to history.
So it's all worked out perfectly...

Yes, that's right. I'm being terribly rude. Bob? Oh, Bob. This is Bob Tuckett. Bon was at Oxford too.

No, it's all right. I can get a cab. Night night.

Everyone describes the same process. At first it is exciting. You're at the centre of the world. As soon as anything happens, you're the first to know about it. And there are deadlines a dozen times a day, even more, and that's intimidating and exciting. Then you get the hang of it and the excitement wears off. Your a clerk in a rather dowdy

Mummy and I, we were more like lovers, really, or sisters. Then a couple of years after Daddy died, and not long after I left Oxford, she started seeing various men and I was furious. I really was upset. I stopped going home. I never phoned. I went round telling everyone how awful her books were. And she hardly seemed to notice, and that
How nice.
How nice.
It makes me weepy just to remember it. So we were fine again, and then she got married to Matthew who's a womaniser and a bit of a yob, but quite nice really, makes TV commercials. What about yours.

I think she liked me.

Did she talk about me?

Do you think she's invited you up for her sake or for mine?
I haven't really thought about it.
I haven't really thought about it.
Well, you should.
I haven't seen much of you.

Ah, ah. There's more. The piece celebrates the undying affection between eminent left-wing historian and he dazzling daughter. Then the news editor, who happened to be in the room, said that years ago, when he worked on The Guardian, Anne Barrington had written a very good piece on...guess...Suez. It was 1966, the tenth anniversary.
She's never written a book in it, but she clearly knew a lot.
Mmm...

You're a piece of shit
I've known Susan for more than fifteen years. James, we're old allies.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
I'm waiting for your mother.

She said awfully sorry, make yourself comfortable, she won't be long. .

Why not sit down and wait?

Okay, I will.

She's not my mother, anyway. My mother's in Italy.

Oh, I see.

Have you come to talk about me?
Have you come to talk about me?
Not at all. History.
What period?
Suez. 1956.
Suez. 1956.
Do you want to hear my list of English Kings and Queens?

All right.
All right.
It goes from Henry VIII. Henry VIII, Edward IV, Mary, Elizabeth I, James I, Charles I, Charles II, James II, William and Mary, Ann, George I, II, III and IV, Victoria, Edward VII, George V, Edward VIII, George IV, Elizabeth II.

What about the Cromwells?
What about the Cromwells?
They don't count.
Wait...and with talks at the United Nations still making little progress, tension and anxiety settled on MPs of all parties in Westminster. Speaking on the Jimmy Young Show earlier today, Mrs Thatcher said the prospects of a peaceful solution did not look encouraging. What is it?
Take a look at these.
Not bad.
Fifteen news items. I got exactly the same running order as the bulletin desk. They're all old pros.

Terrific.
It's that lady from Norfolk again.
I'm not here.
I'm not here.
I'm terribly sorry. He doesn't seem to be here ... No ... Yes, if I see him, I will. .. Goodbye. She's going to phone back.
I'm terribly sorry. He doesn't seem to be here ... No ... Yes, if I see him, I will. .. Goodbye. She's going to phone back.
Next time tell her I've gone away.
Hello, Jimmy.
Dad.
Dad.
Come into the kitchen. I'm just making your mother's tea.
So how is she?
Well, she doesn't complain much. You know what she's like. She keeps asking when you're coming...
Well, she doesn't complain much. You know what she's like. She keeps asking when you're coming...
I'm sorry about Saturday, Dad. It was just impossible to get away.
I'm sorry about Saturday, Dad. It was just impossible to get away.
Oh she knows you're very busy, especially now, with everything going on...the doctor said to try her on solids, but she's been right off her food...You take this up to her. Tell her you made it. She'll like that.
Everyone's been marvellous really, Jimmy. The neighbours come and sit with her while I'm at work.
That's good.
That's good.
And Joe Ramage - do you remember him? He comes and helps out in the shop.

Yes, you said.

Now, are you going to have some more tea?
Now, are you going to have some more tea?
No, thanks Dad.
No, thanks Dad.
Or a beer. I've got some in.
I've got to be going. I've got a meeting tonight.
The bed's all made up if you want to stay.
The bed's all made up if you want to stay.
I'll ring you in the next couple of days.
I just might give you a ring when we get back to London. There's one or two things I'd like to... Will you let me have your number before you leave? Have you ever watched a commercial being made?
No.
No.
Well, it's worth seeing.
I'll tell you another thing. We might have led the world once into the Industrial Revolution, now we lead with television commercials. We're the best, it's as simple as that. Even the Americans will admit it now ... the camera work, the acting, the scripts, special effects. We've got the lot. Nearly all the good directors here have ambitions to make serious films. That
Yes.
Yes.
What would you call it?

I dunno. Ploughman's Lunch.

Ploughman's Lunch. Traditional English fare.

U-huh.
U-huh.
In fact it's the invention of an advertising campaign they ran in the early sixties to encourage people to eat in pubs. A completely successful fabrication of the past, the Ploughman's Lunch was.
Susan told me that your visits to Norfolk had ... well, an ulterior motive.
She said that?
She said that?
You weren't really interested in Suez at all. Incredibly enough, you were interested in my wife.
You weren't really interested in Suez at all. Incredibly enough, you were interested in my wife.
Now listen...
Now listen...
No, no, let me go on before you get the wrong idea. Ann and I have kept to our separate bedrooms for the last three years. And I can't imagine that Susan hasn't hinted at the kind of life I lead in London. I'm not telling you how to run your affairs. I'm just saying ... I don't mind. I'm giving you permission.
Jeremy! How Fantastic.
Darling Susan.
Darling Susan.
You're so famous now.

And you're so beautiful. What are you doing here?

We're thinking of doing this current affairs thing for schools. World history since 1945. Twelve programmes, lots of stock film.

In that case, you should meet my very dear friend, James Penfield. Brilliant analyst of recent history and a world authority on the Berlin Airlift.
It was last year.
We might be able to dig out a couple of Suez survivors for you.
Darling Susan. You look like an angel. But where's your hat?
Oh no!
Oh no!
They won't let you in without one.
Don't point it at James!
Voila!
What have you got there?
You'd look naked without one.
You'd look naked without one.
Oh, yes! Where's mine? I want to look like you.
We'll see what we can do.
Promise?
Promise?
Promise.
It was incredible. He came back, made a pompous little bow and said, 'My dear girl you may film me all afternoon if you wish.' And he's promised not to talk to the Press.
It's because he desires you. The women get all the breaks at these conferences.

It's true! I was here last year doing a piece, remember? I was in the bar with all these Northern trade unionists and their sponsored MPs. They were all incredibly fat and beery, huge trousers and braces. And so sweet. They all stood round me like children saying 'You! Working for television? You're just a young thing.' They wouldn't let me buy drinks even

Then one of them was sick all over your new dress.

No, he wasn't. He just lowered himself into a bar stool and said... 'Oo I do feel bad. I 'ad three pints of lager and six onion bajees!'
Don't close the door. Don't turn out the hall light.
I won't. Goodnight.
I won't. Goodnight.
'Night.
Ah, Susy, it...
Tom . .. bed! Go on.
Don't you want to walk, Tom?
No.
No.
Actually, I've been once today already. I'll stay here with him.
Something happened. You got nuked in the last quarter.
Yeah, my knee got folded about 90 degrees the wrong way.

Friends of yours, huh?
The one you decked is Bunker Wiess. The big one is his brother, Warchild. The other two always hang. They think they're some kinda death squad around here.

What's their program?
What's their program?
They're punks. Nazis. Their brains are wired wrong. They hurt surfing because they give nothing back, and they have no respect for the sea. They just want to get radical. It's mindless aggression. They'll never get it, the spiritual side of it.

Thanks for stepping in.

De nada.
Gonna be some people at my house tonight. Maybe you can make it.
Where?
Where?
Come with Tyler. She knows.
Don't you gamble?
Only make bets I can't afford to lose. Only way to be 100% committed.
So what's the biggest? Waimea?
No, Bells Beach, Australia.
I gotta be fucking crazy.
Yeah, but are you crazy enough?
Football's a man-made game. You keep score with numbers. But in this, there's no field, no rules, no opponent. Just you and the wave.
I know that part. Tell me something I can use, here.
I know that part. Tell me something I can use, here.
I've watched you once or twice. You surf like it's some kind of street fight. You jerk along from moment to moment, fighting everything that comes at you. Always trying to win.

A flaw I'm working on.
A flaw I'm working on.
The only way to win out here is to surrender. You have to feel what the wave is doing, accept its energy, get in sync. Just feel it all moving in the blackness... you don't need to see.

Yeah, right, vision is highly over- rated.
How you figure?
News, last night... those guys, the Ex-Presidents... they robbed my bank yesterday. And I was just there the day before, cashing a check. See... look. Assured Trust... same place.
One shot stopping.
'One shot stopping'... good, very good. I like you, Johnny. I like you because you'll sacrifice anything to win. I respect that. It elevates you a little above the drones who have learned compromise. Here, hold it. Check out the weight.
Ever done this before?
Once.
Once.
Pure adrenalin, right?! The ultimate rush. Other guys snort for it, jab a vein for it -- all you gotta do is jump.

Yeah, I noticed you limping. But don't worry about it, brah. Don't worry at all. We're not gonna land on land!
It's a little ceremony we always have at the end of summer. One last speedstar.
So, who... uh, who packed my chute?
So, who... uh, who packed my chute?
I did. What's the matter? Don't trust me?
I did. What's the matter? Don't trust me?
You gotta earn trust.

Then we'll earn it together. Here, take mine.
We gonna jump or jerk off?
My man!
Utah, you copy bruddah?
Whoooaaah! Shhiiittt! Whoooaaah!
Whoooaaah! Shhiiittt! Whoooaaah!
I'll take that as a yes.
You gonna pull?
After you, Alfonse. I insist!
Don't screw around man, pull it!
You do it... you first!

One thousand feet. Pull the goddamn cord!

You first!

Okay!
What's this?
Insurance policy. Now this is going to sting a bit, but it's for your own growth, brah. Press play.
You're a fucking dead man--
Whoa, whoa!! Think it through! I'm the only one knows where they are. Just let me talk for a second.
Talk.
She'll be fine, Rosie won't do anything. At least not as long as I meet him at a certain place and time, about... let's see... ... six hours from now.
You call him... right now... and tell him to let her go.
Sorry, can't do it, brah. He's on the road. And where they're going there's no phones. Damn, I hate this Johnny, I really do. I hate violence. See, that's why I need Rosie. I could never make this thing work, myself. No way I could hold a knife to Tyler's throat, man! She was my woman, once. We shared time in this world. But
We're wasting time.
See! That's what I like about you, man! You're just sharp as a razor blade.
I can't do this.
Sure you can! You may even like it... it's a killer rush. You'll see. Hey, don't I show you things, Johnny U?
Sure you can! You may even like it... it's a killer rush. You'll see. Hey, don't I show you things, Johnny U?
Bodhi, this is your wake up call, man -- I... am... an... Eff... Bee... Eye... Agent!!
Bodhi, this is your wake up call, man -- I... am... an... Eff... Bee... Eye... Agent!!
Wild, ain't it?! See, we exist on a higher plane, you and I. We make our own rules. Why be a servant of the law Johnny U... when you can be it's master?
I'm not armed.
But you're not alone.
But you're not alone.
Good guess. There's a gun on you right now.
Where's Roach?
Around somewhere. Listen, I'm in kind of a hurry, Johnny U. What can I do for you?
Around somewhere. Listen, I'm in kind of a hurry, Johnny U. What can I do for you?
You gotta tell me where she is.

And let my policy expire? Sorry.

Look, Bodhi man. People are dead. The ride is over.
Look, Bodhi man. People are dead. The ride is over.
I say when it's over!
I say when it's over!
The guy you killed was an off duty cop! If you get out of here they'll nail you wherever you land. They have a new thing called radar. Maybe you've heard of it.
Why should I?
What if your chute fails, Bodhi? Rescind the order. Let her off the hook, she's served her purpose. Do it, man, you owe me that much. Let me hear it before you check out.
Pretty radical, Johnny. Even for you. Why don't you pull it?
No games, Bodhi. Pull the cord! Now!!
No games, Bodhi. Pull the cord! Now!!
Naw, you pull it!
Go on, Johnny. Pull it. But you gotta drop the gun, first! Right?! You use your other hand what you gonna hold on with?
Pull it right now or I'll blow your fucking head off and pull it myself!
Pull it right now or I'll blow your fucking head off and pull it myself!
Well that's the only way it's gonna happen, man. Do it! Come on, you want to do it. You're gonna die, Johnny. Five more seconds. Four...
Three seconds... two... one...
SHIT!!
Wild ride, huh?
Jesus Christ, Bodhi!
And I always knew I could count on you, Agent Utah.
I'm not FBI anymore.
I'm not FBI anymore.
You never were...
You never were...
I asked them to give me a couple minutes...
Yeah? What?
Have you seen a little dog? Kind of a cockapoo lookin' thing. About this big.
Have you seen a little dog? Kind of a cockapoo lookin' thing. About this big.
No.
You sure he isn't out back? You mind if I go take a look?
Look, I don't know anything about your dog, okay--
Look, I don't know anything about your dog, okay--
Well is there anyone else here that might have seen him?
Well is there anyone else here that might have seen him?
There's nobody else here...
You know less than nothing. If you even knew that you knew nothing, at least that would be something, but you don't.
Yes, sir.
Eating solid breakfasts, Utah?
Sir?
Sir?
All the food groups? Avoiding sugar? Caffeine? I see to it that my people maintain cardiovascular fitness. We stay off hard liquor, cigarettes...

1322 last year in LA county. Up 26 percent from the year before.
That's right. And we nailed over a thousand of them. We did it by crunching data. Good crime-scene work, good lab work, good data-base analysis. Nobody had to tackle a car once. You getting the signal, special agent?

Zero distortion, sir.
You're a real blue-flame special, aren't you, Utah? I don't know why they sent you to LA. Must be an asshole shortage.
Not so far.
How was the beach?
Fine.
Fine.
Surf conditions okay?
Surf conditions okay?
A little mushy.
A little mushy.
A little mushy! You think the taxpayers would like it, Utah, if they knew they were paying a federal agent to surf and pick up girls?
A little mushy! You think the taxpayers would like it, Utah, if they knew they were paying a federal agent to surf and pick up girls?
Babes.
Babes.
What?
What?
The correct term is babes, sir. Uh, this type of undercover operation is entirely dependent on picking up the idiom of the speech. Otherwise penetration is not possible, sir. Of the social infrastructure, I mean.
Special Agent Utah, this is not some job flippin' burgers at the drive-in. Yes, the surfboard bothers me. Yes, your approach to this case bothers me. And yes, you bother me. You two have produced squat in the last two weeks, during which time the Ex- Presidents have robbed two more banks!! Do you have anything even remotely interesting to tell me?
Caught my first tube this morning.
Three men dead. One of them a cop. How's that sit in your gut, Utah?
Take your hand off my shoulder right now.
They found the drop car up on Mulholland. I want you two to go work it.
What? Now I'm working the drop car? Who's handling the scene here?
What? Now I'm working the drop car? Who's handling the scene here?
Cole and Munoz. I'm uh... letting them run with the ball for a while.
Cole and Munoz? I been on this case for two years.
That's the point, isn't it?
That's the point, isn't it?
Yeah, I get it. Time to play let's dick the old guys, huh, Harp?
Yeah, I get it. Time to play let's dick the old guys, huh, Harp?
Supervising Special Agent, Harp. Now I want you to go work the drop car, okay, Angelo? Okay?
Look, Harp. Don't turn him over to the uniforms like some punk. Let me ride him in.
Yeah, sure. Why not? You two screw-ups deserve each other. That's why I put you together in the first place. Christ Pappas, you're as bad as he is... talk about the blind leading the blind--
Harp, let me tell you something. I was an agent in this bureau when your mommy was still wiping your shinny pink ass, and you know one thing I learned in all those years that you still haven't?
What that?
Added to which indignity, I got three months left to retirement and they saddle me with some blue-flamer fresh out of Quantico for a partner. Some quarterback punk, Johnny Unitas or something.
The shit they pull, huh?
Pappas. Angelo Pappas.
Punk. Quarterback Punk.
Punk. Quarterback Punk.
Welcome to Sea World, kid.
Good move.
Yeah, they control the room well. Stick strictly to the cash drawers.
They don't go for the vault?
Never go for the vault. They never get greedy.
Never go for the vault. They never get greedy.
Smart. You burn time in the vault.
Smart. You burn time in the vault.
Reagan usually drives. Stolen switch car, they leave it running at the curb, looks parked from a distance. When they run, they dump the vehicle and vanish. And I mean vanish.
Surgical. Look at them separate the dye packs. Dick and Ronny know their jobs.
The Ex-Presidents are the best I've seen, kid.
You through, Mr. Wizard? Let me know if you find Jimmy Hoffa under the seat while you're at it. Hell, it's only 7:30. The night's still young... you can solve this case and start on another one.
Well, what're your ideas on these guys?
Well, what're your ideas on these guys?
Forget about it, kid. They're ghosts. Let the goddamn yuppie Mormon affirmative action assholes handle it. See I'm almost 55... so I must be senile, right? They better get me out before I start pissing myself in public. Drooling. It would look bad for the Bureau, right?

So you're gonna coast to retirement, when you could nail these guys and go out with come dignity.
So you're gonna coast to retirement, when you could nail these guys and go out with come dignity.
You watch your fucking mouth! Mr. Hoover himself pinned the Seal of Honor right here!
Sorry.
Yeah. That was thirty years ago anyway. L.A.'s changed a lot since then. The air got dirty and the sex got clean. So you want to nail the Ex- Presidents? Be a big hero?
Yeah. That was thirty years ago anyway. L.A.'s changed a lot since then. The air got dirty and the sex got clean. So you want to nail the Ex- Presidents? Be a big hero?
Yeah. What's your theory?
Yeah. What's your theory?
The fucking punks are surfers.
Oh well he must be a surfer.
Shutup, you might learn somethin' you're not careful... So last year Nixon scuffs a counter going over. There was a soil sample. Non- specific mud traces of asphalt, oils, blah, blah... sand and... carnuba wax. So I became a wax expert. There's 80 some uses for this stuff, something like five hundred products.
Candle wax. Car wax. Mustache wax? Could be anything. Guy's waxing his mustache at the beach. Gets sand in it. Wipes it off with a shoe. Shoe scuffs the counter.
The lab made three possible matches, this was one of 'em.
Sex wax? You're not into kinky shit, are you Angelo?
Surfers use it on their boards. They rub sand into it for traction.

Thanks for the tip. I needed this knowledge.
... Four months. June to October. Mmmm...same the year before.
Another month and we don't see 'em again 'til next summer.
Johnny, it's the only way.
Why can't I just walk around with this thing under my arm and act stoned? Ask a few questions.
They're like some kind of tribe. Got their own language. You can't just walk up to these guys. You've got to get out there. Learn some moves. Get into their head. Pick up the speech.
Angelo, this stuff is for little rubber people who don't shave yet.
Angelo, this stuff is for little rubber people who don't shave yet.
It's all balance, right? And coordination. How hard can it be?
I think you gotta hit them straight on!
Got it...
What, you couldn't have just left the thing in your car?
It sticks out, so I can't lock it. Look, Angelo, you think I joined the FBI to learn to surf? This was your lame-o idea in the first place. You gotta back me up on this.
It sticks out, so I can't lock it. Look, Angelo, you think I joined the FBI to learn to surf? This was your lame-o idea in the first place. You gotta back me up on this.
Johnny, all I can say is we better come up with something real soon.
Angelo, pay attention. There's gonna be a test afterward. Lab is showing traces of toxins. PCBs. Heavy elements... selenium, titanium and arsenic.
Guy's the Toxic Avenger.
The beaches are always being closed because of waste spills, right? And surfers are territorial. They stick mostly to certain breaks. If we can get some hair samples, and get a match to a certain beach, we'd know which break the Ex-Presidents surf. You buyin' this?
No. But let's do it, anyway. It's gonna bug the shit out of Harp.
Big zippo so far. How about you?
Patience hotshot. Patience. It'll be subtle, if it's here at all.
No, but there are four guys back there you might check out.
Thanks, buddy.
Look, if you're gonna go leavin' your piece and your shield in the car, you can damn well stay in sight. Okay?
Okay, Dad.
... Felony B and E, three months in juvey. Better. Felony assault. Postgraduate work at Chino. Excellent. I'm lovin' it. What about the brother? Great! Another model citizen. These guys really fit the profile.
Remember, all bank robbers are losers, but not all losers are bank robbers.
When did Harp say they'd have the warrant?
He's pushing it through first thing. You better get some sleep tonight, it could be an interesting morning.
Did that worthless punk partner of mine ever show up?
Right here, partner.
I'm ready to rock, Angelo. Where you want me?
Cole and Munoz are going in the back door. Babbit is backing me. So I want you at the side window by the hedge. You're strictly backup, got it?
Cole and Munoz are going in the back door. Babbit is backing me. So I want you at the side window by the hedge. You're strictly backup, got it?
Got it.
Got it.
Awright. Get into position. I'm rolling.
Aw shit.
Nice tattoo, Dietz.
Johnny! Uh, you, uh... should call first, you know? Hey, where the hell were you all day? You gotta at least call in or something. You okay?
Angelo, we gotta talk.
... so I started tailing him.
This Zen master surfer.
This Zen master surfer.
Bodhi, yeah. I'm on him all day, right. He goes here, he goes there, he goes to Tower Records and buys come CDs, he has lunch at Patrick's Road House... ... he goes into the Assured Trust Savings and Loan.
Bodhi, yeah. I'm on him all day, right. He goes here, he goes there, he goes to Tower Records and buys come CDs, he has lunch at Patrick's Road House... ... he goes into the Assured Trust Savings and Loan.
Did he rob it?
Did he rob it?
Cute. He was inside for about 20 minutes. The other guy, Roach, waited in the truck. They were scoping it out, right?!
Cute. He was inside for about 20 minutes. The other guy, Roach, waited in the truck. They were scoping it out, right?!
Yeah, or cashing a check.
Yeah, or cashing a check.
Wait, wait. Then these guys go back to their beach house and box up all their shit. Load it in Bodhi's truck and take it to a public storage unit. You see? Summer's almost over. They're splitting. They're gonna pick up a little traveling money tomorrow. The next day at the outside latest. I got a feeling.

Last time you got a feeling I had to kill a man, which I always hate because it looks bad on the report.
Last time you got a feeling I had to kill a man, which I always hate because it looks bad on the report.
Angelo... I'm right this time. We can still win this one.
They're on their way to Maui.
No way. Not yet. Come on.
I say we call it in. Get some backup. But you gotta do it. Harp won't listen to me.
Sure. No problem. I'll just call up and tell him his favorite agent saw this one surfer moon another surfer yesterday and it looked real suspicious. Shit, he'll probably call out the National Guard.

I say we don't call it in. Under no circumstance are we to call this in.

Look, we handle it ourselves, for right now, okay? We cover the bank, whatever. You and me. That way if nothing happens, or more accurately, when nothing happens... I don't get my tits any further into the wringer than they already are.
Time for lunch.
Angelo, it's eleven thirty.
Angelo, it's eleven thirty.
That place up the street has meatball sandwiches. Get me two.
The hell are they?!
They took a left at the next light!
They took a left at the next light!
You sure?!
Nothing?
Nothing.
I know where they're going.
Figured you did.
Angelo! Don't fire!
Kid, get outta the way!!
Kid, get outta the way!!
NOOO!!
What do you want?
Shrimp and fries.
Shrimp and fries.
I mean, what do you want? What are you doing hanging around here.

I need you to teach me.

Gimme a break. One shrimp and fries to go! Anything to drink?

I'm serious.
I'm serious.
I can see that. But forget it. Stick to tennis, or whatever you're good at. Miniature golf. Here, your number's 37.

Well, I'm just gonna go back out there till I catch on to it or break my neck.
What is it? You all of a sudden got this bug you had to go surfing? This is a line, right?
No, no. See, all my life I've done things for other people. In high school I played football because my old man expected me to. Then my parents always figured I'd go to law school, so I did. Football scholarship. Graduated Phi Beta Kappa--

This gonna take long?
This gonna take long?
Wait, so I'm a big hero to my folks, right? But two years ago they got killed in a car wreck and I just suddenly realized all my goals had been their goals. And I hadn't been living my own life. So I wanted something for myself. Something that maybe didn't make any sense. You know what I mean?
I came out here from Ohio a month ago. Never saw the ocean before. I didn't think it would effect me so much. Like I'm drawn to it, or something. I want to do what you do. It's the truth.
Tomorrow, 6 AM. Here. If you're a minute late I'm gone. And Stud... I didn't take you to raise. I can show you a few things but after that you're on your own. That'll be four fifty.
Stop here. Do you agree to do exactly what I say when I say it?
Sure.
Nice place.
He rents it for the summer. Bodhi always gets some slick place and throws it open to every surf burnout around. Most a these guys can't keep a job. When the swell comes, they're gone, they have to ride.
Who's the girl?
Catch of the day.
Catch of the day.
Oh, oh. That sounds personal.

People are expendable to Bodhi.

Meaning you were expendable.

We went out for about five minutes... which is four minutes longer than most of them. But you can't hold it against him, he's... different.

Sure, he's "the Bodhisattva".
Sure, he's "the Bodhisattva".
Yeah, he thinks he's evolved to a higher plane of existence, or something. Maybe he has. You've seen him surf... that frenzy. It seems like anger. It's not. It's the energy of lovemaking. The sea is the woman in his life. She's his only true lover.
Bunch of goddamn adrenaline junkies. I hope you're not buying into this banzai-bullshit like the rest of Bodhi's moonies.
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
I've seen that kamikaze look, Johnny. You've got it. And Bodhi can smell it a mile away. He'll take you to the edge... and past it. Hey, Bodhi.
What's goin' on?
Swell's here, Johnny. Bodhi always knows.
I can barely do this in broad daylight.
Come on. At least no one's gonna see how bad you are.
You had enough?
Yeah. I just want to sit out here for a minute.
Look at you.
What?
What?
Well, usually you have this sort of intense scowl of concentration, like you're doing this for a school project or something... I don't know, like something's driving you. See, it's gone. If I didn't know better I'd say you looked almost happy.

I... I don't know. I can't describe what I'm feeling.
I... I don't know. I can't describe what I'm feeling.
You don't have to.
Those are cold.
Warm them up.
I... I gotta go.
Johnny... what's going on? I don't get it... did I do something?
Johnny... what's going on? I don't get it... did I do something?
No. I'm sorry. I have to go. I'll, uh... I'll call you later. I'm sorry.
Ouch.
Betadyne doesn't hurt.
Betadyne doesn't hurt.
You're kneeling on my hand.
So what'd the other guy look like?
Never saw him, was your basic hit and run.
Never saw him, was your basic hit and run.
But you look like you been in a train wreck, how'd he just drive away?
Jesus Christ, Johnny -- you've been using me! Your jacket's on the floor in the bathroom -- this goddamn thing's half out of the pocket... Oh God, it's all part of some case, isn't it?
Tyler, put the gun down.
Tyler, put the gun down.
You tell me the fucking truth Johnny... did your parents really die in a car crash? DID THEY?!
I work bank robbery. Guys I'm after are surfers. I needed you, at first, but not--
Fuck you, Johnny Utah. Fuck you!! Don't you have a soul? Goddamn you to hell!
Well, I saw you and--
Yeah, you saw me and you figured that if a mere girl can do it, a big strong stud like you shouldn't have any problem. Right?! Well you figured wrong, dork!
Hey! Uh, how do I get back in?
Carefully, tough guy. Very carefully.
Carefully, tough guy. Very carefully.
My name's Johnny Utah!
My name's Johnny Utah!
Who cares!
Who cares!
I'm telling you so when you look back on this moment, you can think... there was this guy named Utah and he was pretty much a dork but maybe not such a bad person and I let him drown in conditions he had no business being in whatsoever... when I could have easily helped him.
Bye.
Wait! Jesus Christ! You're fucking crazy, you know that? You go in there you're gonna eat it on the rocks. Here, follow me.
Major, looks like there were ten, maybe twelve guerrillas. Looks like they took some prisoners from the chopper. Then a different set of track, over there.
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
Six others, U.S. issue jungle boots. They came in from the north, then followed the guerrillas.
Strange, Major. There was a firefight. Shooting in all directions.
I can't believe Jim Hopper walked into an ambush.
I can't believe Jim Hopper walked into an ambush.
I don't believe he did, Sir. I couldn't find a single track. Just doesn't make sense.
I don't believe he did, Sir. I couldn't find a single track. Just doesn't make sense.
What about the rest of Hopper's men?
Billy... What the hell's wrong with you?
Something... in the trees...
You've been pushing too many Pencils, Dillon. Had enough?
No way, old buddy.
No way, old buddy.
You never did know when to quit.
That piece of work you guys pulled off at the Berlin embassy last week was really something. Blew the entry points on three floors and neutralized the opposition in eight seconds flat. Beautiful.
Like the old days, Dillon.
Like the old days, Dillon.
Also heard that you passed on that little job in Libya.
Wasn't my style. We're a rescue unit, not assassins. This must be good. Big shot from the CIA, leaves his desk to come back to the bush. What's so important?
Those cabinet members are very important to our scope of operations in this part of the world. They're about to get squeezed. We can't let that happen. I needed someone who could get the job done, quick and quiet... no screw-ups. I needed the best. The best. So, I pulled a few strings at the State Department... and here we are.

Go on.
Our rendezvous points and radio freqs. are indicated and fixed. AWACS contact on four hour intervals.
Who's our back-up on this?
Who's our back-up on this?
No such thing, old buddy. It's a one way ticket. Once we cross that border, we're on our own.

This gets better by the minute.
You don't know how much I missed this, Dutch!!! Once you get this in your blood, you never get it out!!!
You never were all that smart... let's go!!!
Billy's on it. Heat seeker. Pretty sophisticated for half-asses mountain boys.
They're getting better equipped every day.
Mean anything to you?
Probably another rebel patrol. They operate in here all the time.
I knew this man. Green Berets, out of Fort Bragg. What the hell were they doing in here? You got any answers for this, Dillon?
Jesus... this is inhuman. Uh... I wasn't told of any operations in this area. They shouldn't have been here.
Jesus... this is inhuman. Uh... I wasn't told of any operations in this area. They shouldn't have been here.
Well somebody sent them.
It was all bullshit. All of it. From the start... you set us up, got us in here to do your dirty work.
That's right, I set you up. You're a veteran at this, Dutch, I had to.
That's right, I set you up. You're a veteran at this, Dutch, I had to.
Why us?
Why us?
Because I told you, you're the best. I knew you could do it but I couldn't get you in here without a cover story.
Because I told you, you're the best. I knew you could do it but I couldn't get you in here without a cover story.
What story did you give to Davis?
What story did you give to Davis?
We've been lookin' for this place for months. The chopper must have gotten close when they got shot down. Hopper was sent in to get my men. He was just doing his job. When he disappeared I had to clean this up, I had to stop there bastards. We were so close, we couldn't quit. We couldn't sleep through this one. I needed you,
She's too valuable. She's got to know their whole network. The whole set up. We take her with us.
We take her and she'll give away our position, every chance she gets. No prisoners, Dillon.
Blain... ... Just like the others... no powder burns, no shrapnel.
The wound all fused, cauterized... what the hell did this?
We're still too far in, they won't risk coming in for us.
Expendable assets, Dillon. Seems Langley is never around when you need them.

I can accept that, it comes with the job.
I can accept that, it comes with the job.
Bullshit. You're just like the rest of us.
You're wastin' your time.
No more games.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
We're going to need everyone.
We're going to need everyone.
What are you talking about? We'll be out of here in ten minutes.
What are you talking about? We'll be out of here in ten minutes.
We're not going.
We're not going.
That rendezvous is ten maybe twelve miles, at most! We're almost home. But the chopper won't wait.
He'll be looking for the trip wires. If we're lucky, he won't see this.
Now what, Dutch. You going to send your mystery guest an invitation?
No way, Dutch. I'm going. You get these people and get the hell out of here.
This isn't your style, Dillon.
This isn't your style, Dillon.
Guess I've picked up some bad habits from you, Dutch. Now don't argue with me, you know I'm right. Get to that chopper and hold it for us. We'll be along.

You know you can't win this one.
I'll see you there.
Right behind you.
Thanks.
Anytime.
Don't know, only saw one of 'em. Camouflaged. He was there... ... Those fucking eyes...
What, Sergeant?
What, Sergeant?
Those eyes... disappeared. But I know one thing, Major... ... I drew down and fired right at it. Capped-off two hundred rounds and then the Mini-gun; the full pack. Nothin'... nothin' on this earth could have lived... not at that range.
Take a position over there. I'll work around towards you. When I flush him, you nail him...
... Right, I got a score to settle for the Bro...
... Right, I got a score to settle for the Bro...
We both got scores to settle.
Any sign of the hostages?
We found 'em both, dead. And the gear from the chopper. If they're Central American, I'm a fuckin' Chinaman. By the looks of 'em, I'd say our cabinet minister and his aide are CIA. Another thing, Major, we were lucky... couple of those guys we waxed are Russians, military advisors by the look of it. Something big was about to happen here.
What's got Billy so spooked?
Can't say, Major... been squirrely all mornin'... fuckin' weird... sometimes I think that nose of his is too good... smells things that ain't there.
You saw what?
I saw it.
Put him in his poncho and liner and carry him back. We'll bury him in the morning.
I'll take him.
We've got most of the flares, frags. and two claymores just outside. Nothin's comin' close to here without trippin' on somethin'.
Thank you, Sergeant.
I'm sorry, Bull. It's never easy. He was a good soldier.
The best friend I ever had.
You're looking well, Dutch.
It's been a long time, General.
That's over the border, General.
That's the problem. Apparently they strayed off course. We're certain they've been captured by the guerrillas.
What have you got in mind, General.
We figure we've got less than twenty-four hours to catch up with them. After that, there's not much hope. We want a rescue operation mounted tonight. That doesn't give you much time.
You lift off in three hours. There's one other thing.
What's that, General?
What's that, General?
Someone else will be going in with you.
Took 'em out with a heat seeker.
There's something else, Major...
There's something else, Major...
Mmmnnn...?
Mmmnnn...?
I don't think that was any ordinary army taxi...
What's he got?
Same business, guerrillas hauling two guys from the chopper... followed by men with American equipment...
Major, you'd better take a look at this.
Hawkins?
Hawkins?
I can't tell.
What in God's name...?
I think it's Hawkins.
I think it's Hawkins.
Where the hell is his body?
Where the hell is his body?
There's no sign of it.
How could anyone get through this, carry Blain out, right under our noses without leavin' a trace?
He knows our defenses.
He knows our defenses.
Why didn't he try to kill one of us last night?
Georgia.
No wonder. For starts, you should know that hot pants are <u>horrid</u>, even when you do have the legs to carry them off. What are your plans while you're in town?

You'll want a cocktail dress then. Turn. You have a beautiful figure. A little too out in the open but simply lovely. Size six? Do you need shoes?

Your uncle will like this.

They never are, dear.
Mr. Harris, we know you've purchased at least twenty percent of our stock. We also know you plan to file a formal bid for a majority share.
Twenty-five percent.
We're on the verge of closing a large navy contract. Double is ridiculous but we can assure you a healthy profit on your shares. We would give you a promissory note...
You're not getting any navy contracts.
There's no way you could know that.
But I do know. I also know your lines of credit are over-extended. If I don't buy your company, someone else will... Ah, the escargot.
We can reach an understanding on this.
I don't think so. You should know we're going to fight you with every resource we have.
I don't think so. You should know we're going to fight you with every resource we have.
Do what you have to do. I don't take it personally.
Do what you have to do. I don't take it personally.

I like your hat.
Huh? Oh... yeah. S'okay? Uhm... how're... business things going.
