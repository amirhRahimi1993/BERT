You'll meet new friends. I know ... it's rough. But I have to move, son.
What's that, Dad?
That's the Air Force Base.
Wow. Look at the mountains.
This can be your room if you want it. What do you say?
This can be your room if you want it. What do you say?
Is the hill ours too?
Is the hill ours too?
If we want it, it is.
If we want it, it is.
Let's check it out, Dad.
Wow. There's the town. And there's the air base. This is a great hill.
It's got a name. Copper Ridge. There used to be a copper mine near here.
It's got a name. Copper Ridge. There used to be a copper mine near here.
Let's see what's on the other side. Maybe we'll find some copper.
A meteorite, Dad, look!
It's that time of year again. We should get a pretty good show out here.
It's that time of year again. We should get a pretty good show out here.
Why, Dad?
Why, Dad?
Because the sky is so clear out here.
There are more this year than last.
This should be the heaviest shower of the year.
This should be the heaviest shower of the year.
There's Cassius ...
... and Rigel.
And that one -- to the right of Rigel?
Which one's that? The dull, red one.
That's Mars. The closest planet to us, now. That's why it's more than just a point in the sky.
Well, son? Should we call it a night? I for one have had a long day.
Okay.
Jim -- what's wrong?!
You've got to come see -- a big thing went down over the hill!
It was big -- and it glowed -- and it went down over there -- behind the hill.
What did it look like?
What did it look like?
It was -- it was -- it changed shape. First it was big and round, then it was flat, then it was long and thin.
Are you sure you saw that? In the rain -- it may have <u>looked</u> like it changed shape --
I don't know, Dad. But it was big.
I don't know, Dad. But it was big.
I'll go take a look when the rain lets off.
Are you all right, Dad?
Sure ... fine.
I lost it. It's kind of muddy out there.
Was there anything over the hill?
I had an awful dream.
What, Jim, what?
What, Jim, what?
First lemme look at your necks.
... And then everything blew up. And then I woke up.
That's a doozy of a dream, son.
That's a doozy of a dream, son.
It was so real, Dad.
It was so real, Dad.
It was all made of stuff that's happened to you in the last few days. The sand pit in back of the house, and the meteor shower, and meeting your teacher and the colonel at school, and being afraid of the new kids because you don't know them ...
I know, Ellen. We'll settle down soon.
I was so scared.
I was so scared.
Better now, son?
I have to go over to the town this morning and do a lot of shopping. This house needs just <u>everything</u>. I'll probably be gone all day. Jimmy, hurry up and eat or you'll be late.
I'll take you to school.
I'll take you to school.
You don't have to. The school bus stops right outside here, at 7:30. I've got to run.
It's probably the solenoid. Take it back to Gleason's, they said they'd fix it if we found anything wrong.
I will. But isn't that odd -- about my dream ... ?
What happened to you? Who was that?
That's Ed. Ed works with the Bell Telephone switching division.

Where's your car?
Where's your car?
I left it at work.
I left it at work.
You did? Why? Where were you? They said you left hours ago. We were worried.
I'm home now.
Yes -- but ...
You know, it really is beautiful up there. Let me show you. We'll take a walk after dinner.
George, you're acting very strangely.
What's wrong, Ellen?
It's his nightmare. He still hasn't gotten over it ... about the other side of the hill.
Better get some sleep, son, or you'll be pretty tired at school tomorrow.
Good night.
We'll be by to pick him up in ten minutes.
Yes, Mr. Gardner.
What do you mean -- gone? What the hell kind of a nurse are you, anyway?
I'm sorry, Mr. Gardner. I was out of my office for a minute and when I got back -- he was gone.
What did he talk to you about?
He was upset with moving, I believe.
He was upset with moving, I believe.
Is that all he said?
Is that all he said?
Why, yes. Why?
Hello, this is Ms. Magnuson speaking.
I understand, Miss, that you have my son in your office.
I understand, Miss, that you have my son in your office.
Yes, I do, Mr. Gardner.
Yes, I do, Mr. Gardner.
May I ask why?

We were having a little talk.

About what?

Mr. Gardner, I --

You people have a lot of nerve, taking it on yourselves to encourage young children to speak out of turn. I'm of a mind to pull him out of school if this is your idea of how to handle ... What sort of training do you have anyway?

Mr. Gardner, I don't think this is the place to discuss this matter.
Mr. Gardner, I don't think this is the place to discuss this matter.
I'm not particularly interested, <u>Ms.</u> Magnuson, in what you think is correct. My wife and I are going away on a business trip this afternoon and we want Jimmy with us. Keep him in your office until we arrive.

Of course.
This is a new town for you. Do you like it here?
No.
No.
Why not? Moving is hard for anybody. Was it hard for you to leave all your friends?
Why not? Moving is hard for anybody. Was it hard for you to leave all your friends?
I don't have many friends. Dad's all the time moving.
I don't have many friends. Dad's all the time moving.
Can you tell me about that?
That's quite a story. You know that, don't you?
Yes.
Yes.
A UFO lands in back of your house and puts something in your Dad and Mom's necks. Then it gets the police, and your teacher too.
How did it get Mrs. McKeltch?
She said the frog came from around the Copper Ridge. She must've been behind the hill.

What would you think if somebody told you a story like this?
What would you think if somebody told you a story like this?
I'd believe him.
I'd believe him.
Why?
Why?
'Cause he wouldn't lie.
Do you know how to follow a map?
Yes. I can even read star maps.
Yes. I can even read star maps.
This shows how to get to my home. I'm giving you back roads and footpaths, so there's less chance of you being seen.
Jimmy, calm down! What happened? Tell me what happened!
I got trapped in Mrs. McKeltch's van -- and she went to the tunnel and went down there with them -- behind my house. I saw them.

Where, Jimmy?
Where, Jimmy?
Behind my house, up on the ridge.
Behind my house, up on the ridge.
If we go and look and there's nothing there, you'll have to admit to me that this is all in your mind.
This is where it was -- the tunnel opening.
I don't see anything.
I don't see anything.
No, but it was here.
I swear it was here.
But it's not, Jimmy.
But it's not, Jimmy.
No.
No.
Let's go look at the sand pit behind your house.
They'll get us.
We'll be very careful. But we have to see. If something landed there, there would be a big scar in the ground. Wouldn't there?
Does it look to you like anything landed here?
Maybe -- it landed in the bushes.
Stay here. I'm going to make a phone call.
Who are you calling?
Who are you calling?
The State Police.
Did you call the State Police?
All their lines were busy.
No one comes here after dark.
Hide the car.
Damn.
I know a way.
What is it?
I don't know. I don't know what I'm doing here --
But you saw -- the men go under the sand ...
Yes ... yes, but I'm not sure what I saw anymore.
Don't go in.
I'm not. They must be tunneling under the whole town.
I'm not. They must be tunneling under the whole town.
We can't do this alone. We've got to get help.
We can't do this alone. We've got to get help.
There was a man named Colonel Wilson, from the Air Force Base. He was talking in our class. He said we could visit him any time we wanted. I'll bet he could do something.

Let's try.
You're looking for life?
They didn't find any signs of life on the Viking missions.
Well, come on, you two. Time to go to bed.
Mom -- this is the best show all year.
Mom -- this is the best show all year.
I know. But you have a full day of school tomorrow -- You, too.
What do you think he saw? Could it have been something from the air base?
No, Mom. It wasn't a plane.
George, where have you been?
What happened to your other slipper?
Your father asked you a question.
What? -- I...
Hi. Sorry I'm late.
The back door was open.
Mom. I gotta talk to you.
What?
What?
Don't go over the hill, Mom. Please.
When?
This afternoon. It's wonderful up there -- you still haven't seen the best part.
This afternoon. It's wonderful up there -- you still haven't seen the best part.
I have school.
I have school.
I'll pack us a lunch. Hamburgers. You always like that, don't you.
It's all this moving from place to place. We're never settled. I'm having nightmares myself.
What kind, Mom?
What kind, Mom?
Oh, I can't remember. But people do have bad dreams when their routine is disturbed.
What's the story on Jimmy Gardner?
Gardner? Oh, um -- he's a new student. Just moved here. Why?
Gardner? Oh, um -- he's a new student. Just moved here. Why?
His teacher brought him in to see me. Said he'd been acting up in class. Creating a disturbance. I couldn't get a thing out of him.

Oh?
Oh?
What's his family background?
What's his family background?
They're from out of state. Father's an engineer at the nuclear power plant. I really don't know much about them.
Ms. Magnuson, is Jimmy Gardner with you?
Why, yes.
Why, yes.
Jimmy's father is on the phone. I wonder if you'd take the call.
Jimmy's father is on the phone. I wonder if you'd take the call.
All right. I'll be right back.
Penicillin. At least it will help keep his fever down.
It's really nice of you to help us.
It's really nice of you to help us.
I wish I could do more but we're moving out.

We're going with you. I mean, we're going too.
We're going with you. I mean, we're going too.
Cool.
This could be our last night on Earth. I don't want to die a virgin.
If we do, we'll both die virgins. But at last we'll be together.
What do you want?
You have to leave the White House.
You have to leave the White House.
This is not the time or the place to have this same old discussion.
This is not the time or the place to have this same old discussion.
You don't understand. You have to leave Washington.
In case you haven't noticed, we're in a little bit of a crisis here.
I've worked with embedded loading. They're communicating with a hidden signal. They're going to attack...
I've worked with embedded loading. They're communicating with a hidden signal. They're going to attack...
You're being paranoid.
You're being paranoid.
It's not paranoia. The embedding is very subtle. It's probably been overlooked...
What?
Connie, don't hang up.
Connie, don't hang up.
David? How'd you get this number?
David? How'd you get this number?
Walk to the window. Right in front of you.
And when is the countdown supposed to expire?
Fifty six minutes, forty five seconds.
What do you want me to do?
I want you to leave with us. Right now.
I want you to leave with us. Right now.
I can't leave. We have to tell this to the President.
I can't leave. We have to tell this to the President.
He's not going to listen to me.
You can't be seriously considering firing nuclear weapons?
David, don't...
Just my luck, no ice.
I take it you've heard.
I take it you've heard.
A toast to the end of the world.
You still believe in him.
He's a good man.
He's a good man.
Better be. You left me for him.
Better be. You left me for him.
I wanted a career. Didn't you ever want to be part of something special?
Thirty seconds? Isn't that cutting it a little too close?
We'll be well on our way out of there before we shoot that thing off.
With you? I don't understand why you can't just show someone how to plant the virus, somebody trained for this kind of mission?
If anything goes wrong I'll have to think quickly, adjust the signal, who knows?
Are you all right?
Did it work?
Did it work?
You bet it did.
David thought I was having an affair, which I wasn't.
Punched the President? Oh my god.
Moishe Martinsburg, Mr. President.
My ex-husband works in satellite communications.
He still gets air sick, huh? In all of this I didn't get the chance to thank you two.
Think nothing of it, Spanky.
Spunky. He told you about that?
All he could think about was getting to you. There's still love there I think.
All he could think about was getting to you. There's still love there I think.
Love was never our problem.
Love was never our problem.
All you need is love. John Lennon. Smart man. Shot in the back, very sad.
Can we expect the same kid of panic here as in Russia?
More than likely.
I don't know how you put up with him.
He used to run the NASA. He knows where all the bones are buried. Comes in handy.
He used to run the NASA. He knows where all the bones are buried. Comes in handy.
I'll bet.
You saved a lot of lives.
I could have evacuated the cities hours ago. You know, when I flew in the Gulf War everything is simple. We knew what we had to do. It's not simple anymore, Connie. A lot of people died today. How many didn't have to?
We're losing them.
Then get them out of there.
What the hell is the point of having a beeper if you don't turn it on?
It was turned on. I was ignoring you. What's the big emergency?
It was turned on. I was ignoring you. What's the big emergency?
Started this morning. Every channel is making like it's nineteen fifty. Snow, static, all kinds of distortions. No one knows what the hell is going on.
What the hell is this?
So sue me.
Did you try to switch to transponder channels?
Please, would I be this panicked if it was that simple?
Let's retrofit the dish to another satellite.
We've tried. It's not working. It's almost as though they weren't even there.
There's good news and bad news.
What's the bad news?
What's the bad news?
You're in meal penalty for disturbing my lunch.
You're in meal penalty for disturbing my lunch.
And the good news is you won't charge me.
And the good news is you won't charge me.
No. The good news is I found the problem and it's not our equipment. There's some weird signal embedded within the satellite feed.
No. The good news is I found the problem and it's not our equipment. There's some weird signal embedded within the satellite feed.
That's the good news?
Yes, because the analog signal has a definite sequential digital patterns embedded within it. When I find the exact binary sequence and I apply a phase reversed signal to that calculated spectra analyzer I built you last Christmas, we should be able to block out the overlay completely...
...and we'll be the only guys in town with a clear picture? That's my man.
I've got a lock on the signal pattern. We can filter it out.
Huh? Oh, good, good.
Huh? Oh, good, good.
Strange thing is, if my calculations are right it'll be gone in approximately seven hours anyway. The signal reduces itself every time it recycles. Eventually it will disappear. Are you listening?

Can you believe this?
Can you believe this?
What're you talking about?
What're you talking about?
Haven't you been watching?
Tell her to get the kids and leave town.
What happened?
What happened?
Just do it!
Okay, why did I just send my family to Atlanta?
Remember I told you that the signal hidden within our satellite signal is slowly recycling down to extinction.
Remember I told you that the signal hidden within our satellite signal is slowly recycling down to extinction.
Not really...
Not really...
That signal. It's a countdown.
That signal. It's a countdown.
A countdown to what?
A countdown to what?
Think. It's like in chess. First you strategically position your pieces. Then, when the timing's right. You strike.
Then what?
Checkmate.
What are you waiting? My social security will expire, you'll still be sitting there.
I'm thinking.
I'm thinking.
So think already.
You have any idea how long it takes for those things to decompose?
You don't move soon. I'll begin to decompose.
David, I've been meaning to talk with you. It's nice you've been spending so much time with me, but...
Dad, don't start.
Dad, don't start.
I'm only saying, it's been what? Four years, you still haven't signed your divorce papers.
I'm only saying, it's been what? Four years, you still haven't signed your divorce papers.
Three years.
Three years.
Three, four. Move on. It's not healthy.

You want to borrow the car? You don't have a license.
You want to borrow the car? You don't have a license.
That's okay. You're driving.
It's the White House, for crying out loud. You can't just drive up and ring the bell.
Can't this thing go any faster?
Can't this thing go any faster?
You think they don't know what you know? Believe me, they know. She works for the President. They know everything.
You think they don't know what you know? Believe me, they know. She works for the President. They know everything.
They don't know this.

And you're going to educate them? Tell me something, you're so smart how come you spent eight years at M.I.T. to become a cable repairman?
And you're going to educate them? Tell me something, you're so smart how come you spent eight years at M.I.T. to become a cable repairman?
Dad...

All I'm saying is they've got people who handle these things, David. They want HBO, they'll call you.
What the hell is that?
This, pops, is every phone book in America.
This, pops, is every phone book in America.
You think an important person like Constance is going to be listed?
You think an important person like Constance is going to be listed?
She always keeps her portable phone listed, for emergencies. Sometimes it's just her first initial, sometime her nickname...
Not listed, huh?
I just haven't found it yet. I tried C. Halbrook, Connie Halbrook, Spunky Halbrook...
I just haven't found it yet. I tried C. Halbrook, Connie Halbrook, Spunky Halbrook...
Spunky?
Spunky?
College nickname.
College nickname.
You try Martin?
You try Martin?
She didn't take my name when we were married.
Perfect, she's using it.
It's perfect the line is busy?
It's perfect the line is busy?
Yes. I can use he signal to triangulate her exact position in the White House.
Yes. I can use he signal to triangulate her exact position in the White House.
You can do that?
Sure he'll listen. Why wouldn't he?
Because last time I saw him I punched him in the face.
Because last time I saw him I punched him in the face.
You punched the President in the face?
You punched the President in the face?
He wasn't the President then.
It's Air Force One for crying out loud. Still he gets sick?
Moishe, please, don't talk.
Dad, please...
What was it, Roswell? You had the space ship, the bodies, everything locked up in a bunker, the what is it, Area fifty one. That's it! Area fifty one. You knew and you didn't do nothing!
David, David! What the hell are you doing!?
I'm making a mess.
I'm making a mess.
This I can see.
This I can see.
We've gotta burn the rain forest, Pops. Dump toxic waste, pollute the air, rip up the ozone. Maybe if we screw this planet up enough they won't want it anymore.

David, you're drunk.
Pops, you're a genius!
What'd I say?
What'd I say?
A cold? Of course.
Thanks, Pops.
I want you should know, I'm very proud of you, son.
I'll see how they're doing with the radio transmitter.
Oh shit, we're late.
Oh shit, we're late.
We'll meet you there.
I have a confession to make. I'm not real big on flying.
Great.
What the hell are you doing?
Just getting a feel for her.
Must be thousands of them. What are they doing?
Looks like they're preparing the invasion.
Get us out of here!
I can't shake her free.
What're you doing?
It's not me. They're overriding the system.
Nice meeting you.
You as well.
We're loose!
Doesn't matter. Game's over.
Doesn't matter. Game's over.
I don't hear no fat lady.
With your permission, Mr. President, I'd like to remain my your side.
I had a feeling you would.
I had a feeling you would.
Sir, what happens if they do become hostile?
Sir, what happens if they do become hostile?
Then God help us.
General Grey, co-ordinate with Atlantic Command. Tell them they have twenty five minutes to get as many people out of the cities as they can.
But Mr. President...
But Mr. President...
And get those helicopters away from the ship. Call them back immediately.
Is my wife in the air?
She should be shortly.
Any news on my wife?
The helicopter never arrived at Nellis and there's been no radio contact.
Where are they?
ETA with target; four minutes.
Atlanta, Chicago and Philadelphia, destroyed?
And there are scattered reports of sightings over Miami, Ft. Worth, And Memphis.
And our forces?
We're down to approximately fifteen percent, Sir. If you calculate the time it takes them to destroy a city and move on, we're looking at world wide destruction of every major city within the next thirty six hours.
We're down to approximately fifteen percent, Sir. If you calculate the time it takes them to destroy a city and move on, we're looking at world wide destruction of every major city within the next thirty six hours.
We're being exterminated.
Organize every plane you can find and get some Goddamned pilots to fly them.
Yes, Sir.
How're we doing?
Better than we thought.
We have confirmed divisions of troops from different armies all around the world. Most of Europe, the Middle East and Asia are battle ready.
And our troops here?
And our troops here?
We've been collecting planes from all over but...
We've been collecting planes from all over but...
But what, General?
But what, General?
Pilots, sir. We don't have enough people to get them in the air.
Pilots, sir. We don't have enough people to get them in the air.
Then find them.
Mr. President, just what do you think you're doing?
I'm a pilot, Will. This is where I belong.
Grey, you read me?
Roger, Eagle One, our primary target has shifted course.
Where's it headed?
I think our secret is out. They're headed right for us.
Do not engage until we've confirmed the package has been delivered.
Roger.
Get on the horn with Atlantic Command. Let's upgrade the situation to DEFCON 3.
That's not your call to make, Mr. Nimziki.
Organize a military escort to Crystal Mountain.
Sir, I strongly recommend we move you to a secured location immediately.
More ships keep arriving, fifteen in total so far.
This is crazy. We're loosing our first strike capabilities!
This is crazy. We're loosing our first strike capabilities!
We're trying to communicate with them on all frequencies but we're getting nowhere. Atlantic Command is working on a type of visual communication.
That's impossible...
My God, the Vice President and the Joint Chiefs...
My God, the Vice President and the Joint Chiefs...
Mr. President, we must launch. A delay now would be more costly than when you waited to evacuate the cities!
You were the head of the National Intelligence Agency! You knew all about this. When were you planning on informing the rest of us!?
It had been deemed classified.
It had been deemed classified.
Christ, why didn't you say anything about this when they first arrived? You could have warned us before we launched a counter attack that cost us hundreds of American pilots!
This is ridiculous.
How long would their shields be down?
With their shields down it might be possible.
Please, you're not buying into any of this nonsense, are you? We don't have the manpower or the resources to launch that kind of a campaign. Not to mention that this whole cockamamie plan is dependent on a machine that no one in the world is qualified to operate.
A meteor?
No Sir. Definitely not.
No Sir. Definitely not.
How do you know?
How do you know?
Well, er... it's slowing down.
Well, er... it's slowing down.
It's doing what?
It's doing what?
It's... slowing down, Sir.
He's trying to impress you.
He's doing a good job.
You can't go. Call them back.
Baby, you know how it is. I have to report to El Toro right away.
Baby, you know how it is. I have to report to El Toro right away.
You said you were on leave for the Fourth.
You said you were on leave for the Fourth.
They cancelled it. Why are you acting like this?
Wait. I have to tell you something.
What?
What?
Be careful.
Be careful.
Look, after your shift tonight, why don't you grab Dylan and come stay with me on base.
Look, after your shift tonight, why don't you grab Dylan and come stay with me on base.
Really? You don't mind?
Really? You don't mind?
Naw. I'll just tell my other girlfriends they can't come over tonight.
You know, you're not as charming as you think you are.
Yes, I am.
Yes, I am.
Dick-weed!
Dick-weed!
Butt-munch.
You're late.
You know how I like to make a big entrance.
You're late.
You know me...
You know me...
I know, you like to make a big entrance.
Before we do this, I want you to know I'm sorry.
Sorry for what?
Sorry for what?
I should have done this a long long time ago.
You scared the hell out of me.
Yeah, but what an entrance!
Yeah, but what an entrance!
Dick-weed.
Dick-weed.
Butt-munch.
Your son.
He's my angel.
He's my angel.
Was his father stationed here?
Was his father stationed here?
He wasn't his father. I was kinda hoping he'd want the job, though.
So, what do you do for a living?
I'm a dancer.
I'm a dancer.
Really? Ballet?
Really? Ballet?
No. Exotic.
No. Exotic.
Oh. Sorry.
Oh. Sorry.
Don't be. I'm not. It's good money. 'Side, he's worth it.
And when the dancing's over? What about your future?
Funny, it used to scare me when I thought about the future. Guess it doesn't really matter anymore.
Dylan, come here. I want you to meet the First Lady.
I thought you didn't recognize me.
I thought you didn't recognize me.
Didn't want to say anything. I voted for the other guy.
I don't believe it. They make you learn how to fly everything from an Apache to a Harrier and still they turn you down? What else do they want you to learn?
How to kiss ass.
Jasmine has this thing for dolphins. I had them make it...
I thought you said you were doing to break it off.
That is an affirmative. I have victory dance. Mmmmmmm.
Don't get premature on me, Jimmy. We don't light up 'til the Fat Lady sings.
Don't get premature on me, Jimmy. We don't light up 'til the Fat Lady sings.
I hear you.
I shouldn't have left her.
Don't worry, big guy. I'm sure she got out of here before it happened.
Damn it!
I didn't even see them fire!
I didn't even see them fire!
Command, Eagle One. Switching to "sidewinders." We're moving in.
Jimmy, kick it! They're gaining.
We're already over Mach 2!
We're already over Mach 2!
So push it!
Stevie... I can't...
Jimmy, stay with me.
Stop it.
It's all fuzzy.
It's all fuzzy.
You're gonna break it. Just leave it alone. Here, take your medicine.
I don't need it.
Just take it, dick head. Alicia! Make sure he takes his medicine.
He's got that SEGA Saturn CD, 64 bit, right?
Yeah. What would you think if we went there to live for a while?
Yeah. What would you think if we went there to live for a while?
That'd be cool!
But I gave you some this morning.
I didn't take it. I thought I didn't need it anymore.
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
I'm bringing home the bacon. Earning my keep. And doing a fine job if I do say so myself.

You sure?
You sure?
Damn it, he was doing you a favor. You know how hard it is to find someone who doesn't think you're completely crazy? What are we supposed to do now? Huh? Where are we supposed to go now?
They let you out?
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
We're leaving, don't try and stop us.
You're not going anywhere. You hear me? I'm still your father.
Troy's still my son no matter how you feel about me.
For once in your life think about what's best for Troy. Who has to beg for money to buy him medicine when you screw up? Who?
I couldn't find anything. Everyone is packing up, they're leaving. Word is a space ship is heading this way.
We should leave too.
We should leave too.
There's a group heading south, they said there's a hospital just a couple hours away. I think we should follow them.
How' he doing?
Just fell asleep. He's gonna be just fine. Join me in a little celebration?
I'm not leaving.
We must maintain a working government in a time of crisis...

But, Mr. President...
But, Mr. President...
So far these things have not become hostile. For the moment let's assume they won't. Connie, let's issue statements advising people not to panic, to stay home and take cover.
What the hell's going on?
We're leaving.
I spoke with the Joint Chief when they arrived at NORAD. They agree, we must launch a counter offensive with a full nuclear strike. Hit 'em with everything we've got.
Above American soil?
Above American soil?
If we don't strike soon, there may not be much of an America left to defend.
Why the hell wasn't I told about this place?
Two words, Mr. President. Plausible deniability.
Mr. President?
Deploy.
Call them back.
The other bombers might have more luck. We shouldn't just give up...
The other bombers might have more luck. We shouldn't just give up...
I said call them back.
Mr. President, a real pleasure. They don't let us out much, you know.
Yes.
Yes.
Well, I guess you'd like to see the big tamale? Follow me.
See, we can't duplicate their type of power so we've never been able to experiment. But since these guys started showing up, all the gizmos inside turned on. The last twenty four hours have been really exciting!
People are dying out there. I don't think "exciting" is the word I'd choose to describe it!
What can you tell us about the enemy we're facing?
Not all too dissimilar to us. Breathes oxygen, comparable tolerances to heat, cold... probably why they're interested in our planet. Hey, you wanna see them?
Can they be killed?
These three died in the crash. Their bodies are as frail as our own. You just have to get past their technology, which is, I'm sorry to say, far more advanced.
Why did you people come here?
Air... water... your "sun."

Can we negotiate a truce? Is there room for co-existance? Can there be peace between us?

Peace? No peace.
What do you want us to do?

Die.
Oh, Sallah! What a relief!
Marcus Brody, sir. And where is Indy?
Marcus Brody, sir. And where is Indy?
Oh, he's in Austria. A slight detour.
Oh, he's in Austria. A slight detour.
You are on your own?
Yes, but don't panic. Everything's under control. Have you... have you arranged our supplies?
Oh, yes, of course. But where are we going?
Oh, yes, of course. But where are we going?
Oh, this map will show you. It was drawn by, uh...
Oh, what?... your servant, sir.
And I am his.
My reputation precedes me.
There is no museum in Iskenderun.
Yes.
Papers, sir. Got it here.
Yes.
Egyptian Mail. Morning edition. Run!
Egyptian Mail. Morning edition. Run!
Did you say...? Uh, uh...
May we go home now, please?
The dog!? You are named after the dog...
Marcus! I did it!
You've got it!
You know how long I've been looking for that?!
All your life.
All your life.
All my life!
All my life!
Well done, Indy. Very well done, indeed. This will find a place of honor in our Spanish collection.
Your treat.
Yes. My treat.
What has the old fool got himself into now?
I don't know. But whatever it is, he's in over his head!
Dad?
It's today's mail. And it's been opened.
Venice, Italy!
What is it?
It's Dad's Grail Diary. Every clue he ever followed. Every discovery he made. A complete record of his search for the Holy Grail. This is his whole life. Why would he have sent this to me?
I don't know. But someone must want it pretty badly.
I don't know. But someone must want it pretty badly.
Do you believe, Marcus?
Do you believe the Grail actually exists?
The search for the Cup of Christ is the search for the divine in all of us.
But if you want facts, Indy, I have none to give you. At my age, I'm prepared to take a few things on faith.
Call Donovan, Marcus. Tell him I'll take that ticket to Venice now.
Call Donovan, Marcus. Tell him I'll take that ticket to Venice now.
I'll tell him we'll take two.
Ah, Venice...
Yes. Uh, how will we recognize this Doctor Schneider when we see him?
Yes. Uh, how will we recognize this Doctor Schneider when we see him?
I don't know. Maybe he'll know us.
That doesn't look much like a library.
It looks like a converted church.
Marcus -- I've seen this window before.
Where?
Look, Indy. The Roman numerals!
Dad was onto something here!
Dad was onto something here!
Well, now we know the source of the numbers, but we still don't know what they mean.
How's the head?
It's better, now I've seen this. It's the name of a city. "Alexandretta?" Hmmm...
The present city of Iskenderun is built on its ruins. Marcus -- you remember what the Grail Tablet said. "Across the desert and through the mountain to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon." But where exactly?
Your father would know. Your father did know. Look. He made a map.
Now, he knew there was a city with an oasis due east. Here. He knew the course turned south through the desert to a river, and the river led into the mountains. Here. Straight to the canyon. He knew everything except where to begin, the name of the city.
Alexandretta. Now we know.
Alexandretta. Now we know.
Yes. Now we know.
Yes. Now we know.
Marcus, get hold of Sallah. Tell him to meet you in Iskenderun.
What about you?
I'm going after Dad.
Indy... Indy, you must hurry!! Come quickly!
It's... a leap of faith. Oh, God.
Marcus!
Arghhh! Oh!
Henry! What are you doing here?!
It's a rescue, old boy. Come on.
Henry, the pen --
What?
What?
But don't you see? The pen is mightier than the sword.
Look what you did!
It's war.
The Word of God...
No, Henry. Try not to talk.
No, Henry. Try not to talk.
The Name of God...
Indy! Henry! Follow met I know the way! Haaa!
Got lost in his own museum, huh?
Tell me, what's going to happen when we get to Venice?
Don't worry. Doctor Schneider will be there to meet you.
Don't worry. Doctor Schneider will be there to meet you.
Schneider?
Schneider?
I maintain an apartment in Venice, at your disposal.

Oh, well. That's good. Thank you.
Care to wet your whistle, Marcus?
I'd rather spit in your face. But as I haven't got any spit...
Well, Marcus, we are on the brink of the recovery of the greatest artifact in the history of mankind.
You're meddling with powers you cannot possibly comprehend.
Are you expected?
Don't take that tone with me, my good man. Now buttle off and tell Baron Brunwald that Lord Clarence MacDonald and his lovely assistant are here to view the tapestries.

My name is Donovan. Walter Donovan.
I know who you are Mr. Donovan. Your contributions to the museum over the years have been extremely generous. Some of the pieces in your collection here are very impressive.

Well, like yourself, Doctor Jones, I have a passion for antiquities. Have a look over here. This might interest you.
Well, it's sandstone. Christian symbol. Early Latin text. Mid-Twelfth Century, I should think.
That was our assessment as well.
That was our assessment as well.
Where did this come from?
Where did this come from?
My engineers unearthed it in the mountain region north of Ankara while excavating for copper. Can you translate the inscription?
"Where the cup that holds the blood of Jesus Christ resides forever."
The Holy Grail, Doctor Jones. The chalice used by Christ during the Last Supper. The cup that caught His blood at the Crucifixion and was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea.
The Arthur Legend. I've heard this bedtime story before.
Eternal life, Doctor Jones! The gift of youth to whoever drinks from the Grail. Oh, now that's a bedtime story I'd like to wake up to!

An old man's dream.

Every man's dream. Including your father's, I believe.
Hard to resist, isn't it? The Holy Grail's final resting place described in detail!
What good is it? This Grail Tablet speaks of deserts and mountains and canyons. Pretty vague. Where do you start looking? Maybe if the Tablet were intact, you'd have something to go on. But the entire top portion is missing.

Just the same, an attempt to recover the Grail is currently underway.
Let me tell you another "bedtime story," Doctor Jones. After the Grail was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea, it disappeared and was lost for a thousand years before it was found again by three Knights of the First Crusade. Three brothers, to be exact.
I've heard this one as well. Two of these brothers walked out of the desert one hundred and fifty years after having found the Grail and began the long journey back to France. But only one of them made it. And before dying of extreme old age, he supposedly imparted his tale to a -- to a Franciscan friar, I think.

But only one of them made it. And before dying of extreme old age, he supposedly imparted his tale to a -- to a Franciscan friar, I think.
Not "supposedly," Doctor Jones.
This is the manuscript in which the friar chronicled the Knight's story... it doesn't reveal on location of the Grail, I'm afraid... but the Knight promised that two "markers" that had been left behind would. This Tablet is one of those "markers." It proves the Knight's story is true. But as you pointed out -- it's incomplete. Now, the second "marker" is entombed with

Yes?
Yes?
We've hit a snag. Our project leader has vanished. Along with all his research. Uh, we received a cable from his colleague, Doctor Schneider, who has no idea of his whereabouts or what's become of him. I want you to pick up the trail where he left off. Find the man and you will find the Grail.

You've got the wrong Jones, Mister Donovan. Why don't you try my father?
You've got the wrong Jones, Mister Donovan. Why don't you try my father?
We already have. Your father is the man who's disappeared.
DONOVAN!
Didn't I warn you not to trust anybody, Doctor Jones?
Impossible? What do you say, Jones? Ready to go down in history?
As what? A Nazi stooge like you?
As what? A Nazi stooge like you?
Nazis?! -- Is that the limit of your vision?! The Nazis want to write themselves into the Grail legend and take on the world. Well, they're welcome. But I want the Grail itself. The cup that gives everlasting life. Hitler can have the world, but he can't take it with him. I'm going to be drinking my own health when he's gone the way

Shooting me won't get you anywhere.
Shooting me won't get you anywhere.
You know something, Doctor Jones? You're absolutely right.
I'm through!
We're through!
Doctor Jones?
Yes?
Yes?
I knew it was you --
And my mother's ears. But the rest belongs to you.
Looks like the best parts have already been spoken for.
The last time I saw your father we were in the library. He was very close to tracking down the Knight's Tomb. I've never seen him so excited. He was as giddy as a schoolboy.
Who? Attila the Professor? He was never giddy, even when he was a schoolboy!
Fraulein -- will you permit me?
I usually don't.
I usually don't.
I usually don't either.

In that case, I permit you.
It would make me very happy.
But I'm already sad -- by tomorrow it will have faded.
But I'm already sad -- by tomorrow it will have faded.
Tomorrow I'll steal you another.
My dad sent me this Diary for a reason. Until we find out why, I suggest we keep it to ourselves.
Find something?
Bingo.
You don't disappoint, Doctor Jones. You're a great deal like your father.
You don't disappoint, Doctor Jones. You're a great deal like your father.
Except he's lost, and I'm not.

Are you sure?
Are you sure?
Pretty sure.
It must be one of these...
Look at the artistry of these carvings and the scrollwork.
What's that?
It's a rubbing Dad made of the Grail Tablet.
Wouldn't it be wonderful if he were here now to see this?
He never would have made it past the rats! He hates rats! He's scared to death of them!
Don't wander off.
What?
I said go around!
You said go between them!
You said go between them!
I said don't go between them!

Mine, too.
Mine, too.
What were they looking for?
This.
The Grail Diary.

Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
You had it? You didn't trust me!
At least I let you tag along.
Oh, yes. Give them a flower and they'll follow you anywhere.

No?
No?
No. You like the way I do things.
No. You like the way I do things.
It's lucky I don't do things the same way. You'd still be standing at the Venice pier.
What do you know about this place?
I know the Brunwalds are famous art collectors.
What are you going to do?
Don't know. Think of something.
This one. I think he's in here.
How do you know?
This book contained a map -- a map with no names -- precise directions from the unknown city to the secret Canyon of the Crescent Moon.
So it did.
How did you get here?
Where is it? I want it.
You came back for the book? Why?
My father didn't want it incinerated.
Is that what you think of me? I believe in the Grail, not the Swastika.
Yet you stood up to be counted with the enemy of everything the Grail stands for -- who gives a damn what you think?

All I have to do is squeeze.
All I have to do is scream.
I never expected to see you again.
I'm like a bad penny. I always turn up.
Elsa! Elsa, don't move!
It's ours, Indy. Yours and mine.
It's ours, Indy. Yours and mine.
Elsa, don't cross the Seal. The Knight warned us not to take the Grail from here.
Elsa. Elsa don't. Elsa. Elsa. Give me your other hand, honey. I can't hold you.
I can reach it. I can reach it...
Dad!
Out!
Out!
It's important!
It's important!
Then wait -- count to twenty.

Don't call me that, please.

Oh, it breaks the heart.

I'll never forgive myself --

Don't worry -- I'm fine.

Well, I am sorry about your head, though. But I thought you were one of them.

Humpf -- so I was wrong this time. But by God, I wasn't wrong when I mailed you my Diary. You obviously got it.
I got it and I used it. We found the entrance to the catacombs.

That's for blasphemy. The quest for the Grail is not archaeology. It's a race against evil. If it is captured by the Nazis, the armies of darkness will march all over the face of the earth. Do you understand me?
This is an obsession Dad. I never understood it. Never. Neither did Mom.
This is an obsession Dad. I never understood it. Never. Neither did Mom.

Did I ever tell you to eat up? Go to bed? Wash your ears? Do your homework? No. I respected your privacy and I taught you self-reliance.
What you taught me was that I was less important to you than people who had been dead for five hundred years in another country. And I learned it so well that we've hardly spoken for twenty years.

Dad, how can you?
Dad, how can you?
Very well. I'm here now.
Well... I can't think of anything.
Then what are you complaining about? Look, we have work to do. When we get to Alexandretta we will face three challenges. "First, the breath of God. Only the penitent man will pass. Second, the Word of God, only in the footsteps of God will he proceed. Third, the Path of God, only in the leap from the lion's head will he prove his

What does that mean?
What does that mean?
I don't know. We'll find out.
I didn't know you could fly a plane.
Fly... yes. Land... no.
Dad -- eleven o'clock!!
What happens at eleven o'clock?
Dad, are we hit?!
More or less. Son, I'm sorry. They got us.
Nice landing.
Thanks.
Those people are trying to kill us!
I know, Dad!
I know, Dad!
It's a new experience for me.
It's a new experience for me.
It happens to me all the time.
This is intolerable!
This could be close.
What do you think you're doing?! Get down!
Dad, we're well out of range.
Now, who are all these people?
Who cares? As long as they're keeping Donovan busy. Dad, you stay here while Sallah and I organize some transportation.
Dad?
You call this archaeology?
You call this archaeology?
Get out of there, Dad!

"Only the penitent man will pass. Only the penitent man will pass."
The penitent man will pass. The penitent... the penitent. The penitent man...
The penitent man will pass. The penitent... the penitent. The penitent man...
The penitent man. The penitent...
The penitent man is humble before God.
Penitent. Penitent...
Penitent. Penitent...
The penitent man is humble...
But in the Latin alphabet, "Jehovah" begins with an "I".
"J".
Junior, give me your other hand! I can't hold on!!
I can get it -- I can almost reach it, Dad.
Elsa never really believed in the Grail. She thought she'd found a prize.
What did you find, Dad?
What did you find, Dad?
Me?... Illumination.
What did you find, Junior?
Junior?! Dad...
I like Indiana.
We named the dog Indiana.
Ready?
Ready.
Uh-huh.
After you, Junior.
After you, Junior.
Yes, sir! Haaa!
I knew you'd come, but my strength has left me.
Who are you?
Who are you?
The last of three brothers who swore an oath to find the Grail and to guard it.

That was seven hundred years ago.

A long time to wait.
You're strangely dressed... for a knight.
I'm not exactly... a knight. What do you mean?
I'm not exactly... a knight. What do you mean?
I was chosen because I was the bravest and the most worthy. The honor was mine until another came to challenge me to single combat. I pass it to you who vanquished me.
Get that camel out of the way!
What happened to Marcus, Sallah?
What happened to Marcus, Sallah?
Ah, they set out across the desert this afternoon. I believe they took Mister Brody with them.
That car belonged to my brother-in- law.
Come on -- come on!
I'm going after those horses.
I'll take the camels.
I'll take the camels.
I don't need camels.
I don't need camels.
But, Indy --
But, Indy --
No camels!
Sallah, I said no camels! That's five camels. Can't you Count?
Compensation for my brother-in-law's car. Indy, your father and Brody --
Compensation for my brother-in-law's car. Indy, your father and Brody --
Where's my father?
Where's my father?
They have them. In the belly of that steel beast.
Why are you trying to kill us?
Because you're looking for the Holy Grail.
Because you're looking for the Holy Grail.
My father was looking for the Holy Grail. Did you kill him too?

No.
No.

If you don't let go, Doctor Jones, we'll both die.
If you don't let go, Doctor Jones, we'll both die.

My soul is prepared. How's yours?
This is your last chance.
No, Doctor Jones. It's yours!
All right! Where's my father
If you let me go, I will tell you where he is.
If you let me go, I will tell you where he is.

My name is Kazim.

The secret of the Grail has been safe for a thousand years. And for all that time the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword has been prepared to do anything to keep it safe.
Ask yourself, why do you seek the Cup of Christ? Is it for His glory, or for yours?
I didn't come for the Cup of Christ. I came to find my father.
I didn't come for the Cup of Christ. I came to find my father.
In that case, God be with you in your quest. Your father is being held in the Castle of Brunwald on the Austrian-German border.
Captain Blumburtt and his troops are here to check up on the "natives".
Just a routine inspection tour.
Just a routine inspection tour.
The British worry so about their Empire -- it makes us feel like well- cared-for children.
Dr. Jones, you know very well that the Thuggee cult has been dead for nearly a century.
Of course. The Thuggees were an obscenity that worshipped Kali with human sacrifices. The British Army wiped them out about the time of the Mutiny of 1857.
Well, Mr. Prime Minister, my report will duly note that we found nothing unusual here in Pankot.
I'm sure that will please the Maharajah, Captain.
I'm sure that will please the Maharajah, Captain.
As I said before, we'd be happy to escort you to Delhi.
Interested in local curios?
No. But I am interested in the occult. And this is a kryta.
Charming.
It's like the voodoo dolls of West Africa. The kryta represents your enemy -- and gives you complete power over him.

Thank God all that mumbo jumbo rubbish is disappearing.
Thank God all that mumbo jumbo rubbish is disappearing.
You think so?
You think so?
Of course. Admittedly, it's taken time. Britain's controlled India for almost two hundred years now.
You're hanging on better here than you did in America.
This is a different situation, Dr. Jones. These people are like children. We have to lead them slowly into the twentieth century.
The Prime Minister doesn't seem that naive.
No, he's a very shrewd old boy. Power behind the throne and all that. He actually runs this whole province.
I'm sure it's nothing. Just rumors. What was it they claimed was stolen?
Something magical. A sacred rock.
Rather bizarre menu, wouldn't you say?
Even if they were trying to scare us away, a devout Hindu would never touch meat. Makes you wonder what these people are...
I've spent by life crawling around in caves and tunnels -- I shouldn't have let somebody like Willie go in there with me.
Miss Scott panicked?
Miss Scott panicked?
When she saw the insects she passed out cold. I carried her back to her room. She was sleeping when I re- entered the tunnel to look around.
Then she must have run out of the room and you found her.
Did you discover anything in that tunnel, Dr. Jones?
I believe we're being called to dinner.
Finally!
Jones isn't in his room. Miss Scott -- my troops are leaving at dawn if you want us to escort you to Delhi --
No -- you can't go! Something awful's happened. They've got Short Round and I think Indy's been --
No -- you can't go! Something awful's happened. They've got Short Round and I think Indy's been --
What?
What?
We found a tunnel that leads to a temple below the palace! Please, come with me, I'll show you!
Who?
It's some kind of cult! And they've got the sacred stones that Indy was searching for.
Hard to believe, isn't it...?
I remember first hearing your name when I was studying at Oxford. I am Chattar Lal, Prime Minister for His Highness the Maharajah of Pankot.
The plane crash and your journey here sound -- most incredible.
You should have been there...
He's not exactly what we call "a spring chicken".
No, no, that is Uhmed Singh, the present Maharajah's late father.
No, no, that is Uhmed Singh, the present Maharajah's late father.
Oh -- good. And maybe the present Maharajah is a little younger? And thinner?
They will escort you to your rooms now. You will be provided with fresh clothes. Tonight you will be dining with His Highness.
Dinner? And with a prince?! My luck is changing. But look at me -- my god, I've to get ready!
Listen, Mr. Lal, what do you call the Maharajah's wife?
His Highness has not yet taken a wife.
His Highness has not yet taken a wife.
No? Well, I guess he just hasn't met the right woman...
Miss Scott, you're not making any sense.
I'm afraid they'll kill them! We saw horrible things down there -- they had a human sacrifice and they ripped a man's heart out!
I sense the fumes of opium in all this. Perhaps Miss Scott picked up the habit in Shanghai.
What're you talking about -- I'm not a dope fiend! I saw it! I'll show you!
I would say you look rather lost. But then I cannot imagine where in the world the three of you would look at home...
Lost? No, we're not lost. We're on our way to Delhi. This is Miss Scott -- and Mr. Round. My name's Indiana Jones.
Lost? No, we're not lost. We're on our way to Delhi. This is Miss Scott -- and Mr. Round. My name's Indiana Jones.
Dr. Jones? The eminent archaeologist?
We'd appreciate it if the Maharajah would let us stay tonight. We'll be on out way in the morning.
I am only his humble servant, but the Maharajah usually listens to my advice.
I had a question, Mr. Prime Minister. I was examining some of the Maharajah's artifacts.
A very fine collection of very old pieces, don't you think?
A very fine collection of very old pieces, don't you think?
Yes, very fine. But not all of the pieces look old. Some were carved recently and look like images used by the Thuggees to worship the goddess Kali.
I suppose stories of the Thuggees die hard.
There are no stories anymore.
There are no stories anymore.
Well, I don't know... we came here from a small village and the peasants there told us that the Pankot Palace was growing powerful again -- because of some ancient evil.
Their stories are just fear and folklore.
Maybe... but how do you explain The Thuggee shrine I saw right below the palace?
You know the villagers also claimed that this palace stole something from them.
Dr. Jones, in our country a guest does not usually insult his host.
Dr. Jones, in our country a guest does not usually insult his host.
Sorry, I thought we were just talking about folklore.
There, you see, Captain. A rock!
When they lost this rock their fields and animals died. They also said their children were taken from them.
When they lost this rock their fields and animals died. They also said their children were taken from them.
I think that's enough of this nonsense, Dr. Jones...
I was dubious myself at first. Then something connected -- the village's rock and the old legend of the Sankara Stones...
Dr. Jones, we are all vulnerable to vicious rumors. I seem to remember that in Honduras you were accused of being a grave robber rather than a scientist.

That was a misunderstanding.
That was a misunderstanding.
Exactly what we have here, Dr. Jones.
Mola Ram is telling the faithful of out victory. He says the British have left the palace, which proves Kali Ma's new power.
Yes, I understand.
You understand what he tells us?
Kali Ma protects us now and for ever, and we must pledge our devotion by worshipping her with an offering of flesh and blood!
Dr. Jones.
Lao She.
Lao She.
Nee chin lie how ma?
You never told me you spoke my language, Dr. Jones.
I don't like to show off.
So, it is true, Dr. Jones? You found Nurhachi?
Sure, I found him. Then last night I had a little trouble. Somebody tried to slit my throat.
You have insulted my son.
Next time I'll cut off more than his finger.
Next time I'll cut off more than his finger.
Dr. Jones -- I want Nurhachi.
What's that?
A bonus, Dr. Jones. That is poison. You just drank the rest of it.
Now what about the antidote, Lao.
At last I have the ashes of my sacred ancestor!
Wow! Holy smoke! Crash landing!
Step on it, Short Round!
Step on it, Short Round!
Okey-doke, Indy! Hold onto your potatoes!
You got the tickets, Short Round?
Sure, Indy -- three tickets! You, me and Wu Han --
Indy?
Okay, Shorty.
Indy, they make our plane crash? To get you here?
It's just superstition, Shorty. Like a ghost story.
I ride with you, Indy?
Nope, you got a little surprise over there, Shorty.
Indy, look!
That's it. Pankot Palace.
What you look at, Indy?
Just a statue.
That little Maharajah think he big stuff.
You don't like him do you?
You don't like him do you?
Next time I flatten him! Did you see his eyes?
Next time I flatten him! Did you see his eyes?
No.
No.
Indy, they glow like fire and get real crazy! Then he talk in this real scary voice!
He was afraid of you. He knows a tough guy when he sees one.
Yeah, that's what happened...
Get to sleep Indy -- I stay up and keep eye on things...
Okay, Shorty... see you in the morning... I'm going to have a little -- word with Willie.
What does it mean, Indy?
"Follow in the footsteps of Shiva. Do not betray his truth."
The village knew their rock was magic -- but they didn't know it was one of the lost Sankara Stones...
Why they glow like that?
Why they glow like that?
Legend says that when the stones are brought together the diamonds inside of them will glow.
This is Nainsukh -- from the village. They bring him here to dig in the mines.
Why?
Come one, what's wrong?
Behind you!
Slow on the curves or we'll fly off the tracks!
Read you loud and clear, Indy!
Let up on the brake!
What?
You were caught trying to steal the Sankara Stones.
Nobody's perfect. The way I heard it, you stole one of them from a small village.
There were five stones in the beginning. Over the centuries they were dispersed by wars, sold off by thieves like you...
Two are still missing.
Two are still missing.
No. They are here -- somewhere. A century ago when the British raided this temple and butchered my people, a loyal priest hid the last two stones down here in the catacombs.

That's what you've got these children -- these slaves digging for?
That's what you've got these children -- these slaves digging for?
They dig for the gems to support our cause. They also search for the last two stones. Soon we will have all five Sankara Stones and the Thuggees will be all powerful!

Nobody can say you don't have a vivid imagination.
Nobody can say you don't have a vivid imagination.
You do not believe me? You will, Dr. Jones. You will become a true believer.
That's far enough!
You are in no position to give orders, Dr. Jones.
Give me the stones!
Mola Ram -- you're about to meet Kali -- in Hell!
No, the stones are mine!
You're betrayed Shiva.
On the way to Delhi, you will stop at Pankot.
Pankot isn't on the way to Delhi.
Pankot isn't on the way to Delhi.
You will go to palace there.

Hasn't the Pankot palace been deserted since the Mutiny of 1857?

No. Now there is new Maharajah -- and palace is powerful again.
It is Pankot Palace that kills my village.
I don't understand. What's happened here?
I don't understand. What's happened here?
The evil starts in Pankot. Then like monsoon, it moves darkness over all country.

They came from Palace and took sivalinga from out village.
It is why Krishna brought you here.
Nobody brought us here. Our plane crashed. We were shot down by --
Nobody brought us here. Our plane crashed. We were shot down by --
No. We pray to Krishna to help us find the stone. It was Krishna who made you fall from sky -- so you can got to Pankot Palace. To find sivalinga -- and bring back to us.
Was the stone very smooth? It was probably brought here from a sacred river.
Long ago -- before my father's father.
Long ago -- before my father's father.
And it had three lines painted across it? The lines represent the three levels of the universe. I've seen stones like the one you lost.
But why would the Maharajah take this sacred stone?
They say we must pray to their evil god. We say we will not.
You will find them when you find sivlalinga.
I'm sorry, I don't know how I can help you here.
I like the service here.
Hey, he's not a waiter...
Hey, he's not a waiter...
No, Wu Han's an old friend I brought along. So, the game's not over. Put the antidote on the table, Lao.
Look out, damn it, I need that antidote!
Who cares? Where's that diamond!
For crying out loud, a kid's driving the car?!
Relax, I've been giving him lessons.
Listen, we just met for crissake! I'm not that kind of girl!
Don't get your hopes up -- where's the antidote?
You don't look very good.
Poison never agrees with me. Pull a right, Short Round, and head for the Wang Poo bridge!
What're we going to do?! Where're we going?!
The airport... No, look out, Short Round! Left, left!
I'll take the extra ticket. Where's this plane going anyway?
Siam.
Siam.
Siam? But I'm not dressed for Siam...
So, what're you supposed to be, a lion tamer?
Since I was nice enough to let you tag along, why don't you give your mouth a rest? Okay, doll?
I'm freezing. What do you mean, tag along? From the minute you walked into that nightclub, you haven't been able to keep your eyes off me.
Oh yeah?
Are you crazy, a lift raft?! We're not sinking, we're crashing!
Get over here, damn it! Short Round, come on, grab onto me tight!
You all right?
No... I'm not cut out for the kind of life you lead. Oh no... I ripped my dress. Where are we anyway?
India...
Holy cow -- India? How do you know we're in --
What'd he say?
He told me they knew I was coming here.
He told me they knew I was coming here.
What do you mean -- how?
What do you mean -- how?
The old man saw it in a dream.
The old man saw it in a dream.
Dream -- nightmare is more like it.
Dream -- nightmare is more like it.
He said that's whey they were at river -- they were waiting for the plane to fall down.
God, I am starving, but I can't eat this...
That's more food than these people eat in a week. They're starving, too...
Took what?
It's a sacred stone in a shine that's supposed to protect a village.
And then they took their children.
Their children?
What'd he say now?
It was destined that I came here -- and the future cannot be changed...
Hey, Willie -- I think you better get out now.
Stark naked? You wish... If you're trying to seduce me, Dr. Jones, this is a very primitive approach.
Stark naked? You wish... If you're trying to seduce me, Dr. Jones, this is a very primitive approach.
Me seduce you? Honey, you're the one who took your clothes off. I just came over to remind you that you never know what else might be in the water.
Me seduce you? Honey, you're the one who took your clothes off. I just came over to remind you that you never know what else might be in the water.
Somehow I feel safer in here.
Indy! Help me!
Don't worry, I'm coming in! What is it?
Don't worry, I'm coming in! What is it?
A snake!
A what...?
A SNAKE!!
Hurry, help me out of here! What're you waiting for?!
Uh, listen -- Willie -- I got a better idea.
Uh, listen -- Willie -- I got a better idea.
What?!
What?!
First of all -- don't panic!
Don't let it pull you deeper!
It's pulling me deeper!
It's pulling me deeper!
Don't let it curl around you!
Don't let it curl around you!
It's curling around me! Damn it, stop talking and do something!
Listen, Willie. Do exactly what I tell you now.
What?!
What?!
Can you move your arm?
Can you move your arm?
Just one arm!
Just one arm!
Okay, I want you to lift your hand -- and pet the snake.
Okay, I want you to lift your hand -- and pet the snake.
PET IT??!!

Yes, stroke it right along the maxillary and precaudal vertebrae.
Yes, stroke it right along the maxillary and precaudal vertebrae.
THE WHAT?!
THE WHAT?!
Pet it on the head! Go on, pet it!
Oh -- my -- god -- it's going to crush me!
Keep stroking it!
What's happening?
It's starting to let go!
It's starting to let go!
That's good -- you're doing fine.
Thanks for nothing! I hate snakes!
I know the feeling...
Where'd you find your little bodyguard?
I met Short Round when he tried to pick my pocket.
Shorty's family was killed when they bombed Shanghai. He was living on the streets.
He'll be okay. He's a good kid.
By the way, how'd you end up in Shanghai?
Well, when my nightclub career was run over by the Depression, some pinhead convinced me that "a girl could go places in the Orient..." So, look where I got.
What about the future?
Oh, that's easy -- I'm going to latch onto a good-looking, incredibly rich prince.
I'd like to find one of those myself.
Oh really?
Oh really?
Yeah, but he's got to be dead and buried for a couple of thousand years. Fortune and glory...
Yeah, but he's got to be dead and buried for a couple of thousand years. Fortune and glory...
Is that what you're hoping to find at this palace, Dr. Jones?
Is that what you're hoping to find at this palace, Dr. Jones?
Maybe...
The drawing shows a priest named Sankara who lived centuries ago.
What does the writing say?
What does the writing say?
It's Sanskrit. It tells the story of Sankara climbing Mt. Kalisa where he met the Hindu god Shiva.

That's Shiva? What's he giving the Priest?

Legend says he told Sankara to go forth and combat evil. To do that he gave him five sacred stones that had magical powers.

You mean magical like the rock that was stolen from that village?
I think you should sleep closer. I meant for safety.
I'd be safer sleeping with that snake.
Couldn't keep away, huh?
Just try and control yourself.
He's afraid of something.
He said he couldn't take us any farther. He has to go sell the elephants.
He said he couldn't take us any farther. He has to go sell the elephants.
You mean we have to walk the rest of the way?
Any more complaints?
Yeah, I wish you'd thought of this sooner...
I've always had a weakness for folk dancing.
She might get away with that act here, but she'd never make it in a real nightclub.
That's the Maharajah -- that kid?!
Maybe he likes older women.
Cheer up, you lost your prince, but dinner's on the way.
I've never been so hungry in my life...
Not leftovers?
No -- real food.
You're nice. Listen, I'm taking applications -- how'd you like to be my palace slave?
Wearing your jewels to bed, princess?
Yeah -- and nothing else. That shock you?
I'm a scientist. I like doing research on certain "nocturnal activities" --
Primitive sexual practices?
You're talking to an authority in that area.
You're dying to come into my room, aren't you?
You want me so bad, why don't you invite me?
You want me so bad, why don't you invite me?
Too proud to admit you're crazy about me, Dr. Jones?
Too proud to admit you're crazy about me, Dr. Jones?
I think you're too used to getting you own way, Willie...
We'll see who gives in first -- I'll leave my door open.
Don't catch cold.
Don't catch cold.
Dr. Jones?
Five minutes... you'll be back over here in five minutes...
You're dreaming, Willie. You want to make it real, just knock on my door.
No -- don't you see -- crawling --
What -- the bug?
Get -- the -- bug -- off!
Gee, I wouldn't want to touch an ugly critter like that!
Oh no -- oh no!!
You know, Willie, I'll bet he's mad because they were eating his friends for dinner.
You know, Willie, I'll bet he's mad because they were eating his friends for dinner.
Please -- oh please, I'm going to die! Get it off!
What?!
Willie, come here! Hurry up, we're in trouble!!
WILLIE?!
I'm coming, what's the rush?! Ohh! What's that?! There's stuff all over the floor! I can't see a thing!
There's bugs! Bugs all over! Help! Help me!
Willie, open the door! GET US OUT OF HERE!
GET US OUT! Willie, shut up and listen! There's got to be a fulcrum release! Look around!
A what?!
A fulcrum release lever!
I can't find any lever! Help me Indy!
There's a hole! I found a square hole!
That's it -- the release lever -- look inside!
That's it -- the release lever -- look inside!
I am -- it looks horrible!
Oh God, it's soft -- it's moving!
Willie!
What is it...?
It's a Thuggee ceremony. They're worshipping Kali, the goddess of Death and Destruction.
Oh my God! He ripped out his -- he killed him!
No... the heart's still beating!
Let's go! Let's get out of here!
Quiet!
Wait -- what're you doing?
I'm going down.
I'm going down.
Down? Down there?! Are you crazy!
Down? Down there?! Are you crazy!
I'm not leaving without those stones.
I'm not leaving without those stones.
You're gonna get killed chasing after your damn fortune and glory!
You're gonna get killed chasing after your damn fortune and glory!
Maybe... someday. Not today.
It's okay. You're all right now.
They think I'm insane. Tell them I'm not, Indy. Please -- help me ...
What?
You've got to go to sleep now.
You've got to go to sleep now.
I want to go home...
I want to go home...
I don't blame you... this hasn't been what you'd call a fun vacation...
Indy? Did you talk to them?
Yes.
Yes.
So now they believe me.
So now they believe me.
Yes, they believe you.
I was scared to death last night when I thought they were going to kill you.
No... they won't kill me.
No... they won't kill me.
You know you've been nothing but trouble since I hooked up with you -- but I have to admit I'd miss you if I lost you...
What're we going to do?!
There's got to be another way out.
I can't!
Go!
Let her go! Our only chance is outrunning them!
What above the curves?!
Anymore ideas...?
Yeah -- this time you're gonna help!
I guess Mola Ram got what he wanted.
Not quite.

It's in the watch. He lead us on that chase while Dieter brought the chip into Hong Kong.
And Dieter?
And Dieter?
He must not know. GRUNER just made the switch back.
Then, why'd he lead us here.
He didn't. He left us that walkman chip to confuse us. Would have kept most people busy. We were too fast for him.

And don't let her know, either.
This may hurt.
Well, don't let it. What are you doing?
Pretty advanced, isn't it?
Ought to be, they stole everything and reverse-engineered it. Looks like all they need is the chip.
Do something.
What exactly?

What happened?

Yeah? What for?
Yeah? What for?
For reading.
That's great... Little early for cartoons, isn't it?
Okay.
Sweetheart, c'mon. C'mon.
She was playing with my Pooh doll again...
Here we go. Deep breaths, deep breaths.
She was playing with the Pooh doll.
She was playing with the Pooh doll.
Pooh's dusty, sweetheart... he's dusty, and you breathed him in, okay? So what's -- what's happening to you now is... cells called mast cells told your lungs "don't breathe any more of that dust in." ...and the airways in your lungs are like branches. And when the branches close up, you get an asthmatic attack. And, we give you medicine, and you get better.
I'll take some.
Instant rice...?
Instant rice...?
Can I go over to Janeane's house?
Hey, baby. What's wrong?
What's that outside, Daddy?
What's that outside, Daddy?
Did you see somebody or did you hear them?
Did you see somebody or did you hear them?
I heard them.
I heard them.
Where?
Where?
In the backyard.
He's into kind of little cars, that...
That remote control thing?
That remote control thing?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Alright, we'll do that tomorrow.
Alright, we'll do that tomorrow.
Mom.
Mom.
Yes, baby?
Yes, baby?
There's Dad, on TV.
Let me tell you something, Lowell. Look, look, look. You're talking about two agents in a regional office in Louisville. I got the goddamn Unabomber threatening to blow up LAX! I gotta move 45 agents from all over the country into L.A. Alright? When I get a chance, I'll give it a look...
You better take a good look! Because I'm getting two things: pissed off and curious! Now, any of these guys been offered jobs in corporate security after they retire? Either one of those guys have ex-agent pals already in those jobs? Like, for instance, their ex-supervisor, who's already at Brown & Williamson as we fucking speak?
Just ran into two of your "geologists." Geologists whose hands aren't all chewed up...?
Lowell?
We'll give you a heads up before we launch.
How long?
How long?
Three hours.
Three hours.
You got a deal.
Well, are you or are you not, Charlie?
You bet we are. And I can't talk to you now.
You bet we are. And I can't talk to you now.
We gotta hook up.
We gotta hook up.
Sure. Where?
Sure. Where?
P.J.'s.
P.J.'s.
I'll be there.
When's your deadline?
Monday.
Monday.
Push it.
Push it.
What? Forget it.
What? Forget it.
It's a smear campaign, Charlie.
It's a smear campaign, Charlie.
It's drawn from a selectively circulated...
It's drawn from a selectively circulated...
Oh, it's real selective... about as hard to get a hold of as the Manhattan phone book.
Oh, it's real selective... about as hard to get a hold of as the Manhattan phone book.
Well, it's authoritative and is overwhelmingly documented.
Well, it's authoritative and is overwhelmingly documented.
And it's bullshit. And if I'm right, are you going to put the Journal's reputation behind a story that's going to blow up in your face?
And it's bullshit. And if I'm right, are you going to put the Journal's reputation behind a story that's going to blow up in your face?
I'll take a look at what you got. But I'm not moving any deadlines 'cause you say so.
Are you all right?
Yeah. Catch you later.
These are their leads, their sources. I want you to have your reporters...
Suein Hwang and Milo Geyelin.
Suein Hwang and Milo Geyelin.
Have them make their own calls. They'll find that these sources have a different story than the one that's in the dossier... Push the deadline, Charlie...
I want you to get legal onto CORPORATE CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS. Boundaries of their constraint. Kentucky state law about. I want you to drop everything.
Okay.
What does that do?
What do you mean, what's it do?
What do you mean, what's it do?
What I mean is, like, how does it cut through the confidentiality agreement?
What I mean is, like, how does it cut through the confidentiality agreement?
Because he has to reveal it in a court of law. It's on record, it's out. It's no secret anymore. So how can they restrain his speech or retaliate? It's out in the world...
Shit...
Oh, we need cops on the street. We don't need them on horses.
Oh, we need cops on the street. We don't need them on horses.
I don't know what he was thinking.
I don't know what he was thinking.
Oh, for God's sake, what has this guy got, a horse fetish?
Oh, for God's sake, what has this guy got, a horse fetish?
Alright, alright.
Alright, alright.
Get me to New Orleans this afternoon. I'll shoot the fucking thing myself!
When's the air date?
Excuse me, Lowell. Sharon's on line 3.
Excuse me, Lowell. Sharon's on line 3.
Tell her I'll call her back in ten.
What was that about?
Get me Wigand.
Get me Wigand.
Sure.
Sure.
...fuck is this? Fuck!
I can't get out of here til mid- morning. I'll be in tomorrow night... Listen, could you call a number for me, it's in Mississippi...
Okay. Hold on a second... What is it?
Yeah. Yeah, sure. I'll see if I can find him. Hold on... Yeah, Don's looking for you...
Good.
Good.
The sub-heading is, "Brown & Williamson Has a 500-Page Dossier Attacking Chief Critic." It quotes Richard Scruggs calling it "the worst kind of an organized smear campaign against a whistle-blower."
Can I go to dance tomorrow? I'm better...
...if you are, then I'll take Barbara to soccer and take you to dance after...
Do you want more rice?
Maybe later.
Maybe later.
How about you?
What are you cooking?
I'm cooking pasta primavera.
I'm cooking pasta primavera.
Oh, I love that stuff.
I heard Wigand's deposition got sealed.
Yeah, they argued he was going to reveal the secret formula of "Kools" to the world. "Sealed" doesn't hurt Scruggs' litigation, and since we're the only ones with the story, I believe we're sitting on an exclusive.
"Tortious interference"? Sounds like a disease caught by a radio.
Lunch?
Since when has the paragon of investigative journalism allowed lawyers to determine the news content on "60 Minutes"?
It's an alternate version. So what if we have an alternate version? And I don't think her being cautious is so damned unreasonable.
Yeah, I heard rumors.
It's not a rumor. It's a sale. If Tisch can unload CBS for $81 a share to Westinghouse and then is suddenly threatened with a multibillion-dollar lawsuit from Brown & Williamson, that could screw up the sale, could it not?
Are you suggesting that she and Eric are influenced by money?
Oh, no, of course they're not influenced by money. They work for free. And you are a Volunteer Executive Producer.
Oh, no, of course they're not influenced by money. They work for free. And you are a Volunteer Executive Producer.
CBS does not do that. And, you're questioning our journalistic integrity?!
CBS does not do that. And, you're questioning our journalistic integrity?!
No, I'm questioning your hearing! You hear "reasonable" and "tortious interference." I hear... "Potential Brown & Williamson lawsuit jeopardizing the sale of CBS to Westinghouse." I hear... "Shut the segment down. Cut Wigand loose. Obey orders. And fuck off...!" That's what I hear.
No, I'm questioning your hearing! You hear "reasonable" and "tortious interference." I hear... "Potential Brown & Williamson lawsuit jeopardizing the sale of CBS to Westinghouse." I hear... "Shut the segment down. Cut Wigand loose. Obey orders. And fuck off...!" That's what I hear.
You're exaggerating!
You're exaggerating!
I am? You pay me to go get guys like Wigand, to draw him out. To get him to trust us, to get him to go on television. I do. I deliver him. He sits. He talks. He violates his own fucking confidentiality agreement. And he's only the key witness in the biggest public health reform issue, maybe the biggest, most-expensive corporate-malfeasance case in

You are a fanatic. An anarchist. You know that? If we can't have a whole show, then I want half a show rather than no show. But oh, no, not you. You won't be satisfied unless you're putting the company at risk!

C'mon, what are you? And are you a businessman? Or are you a newsman?! Because that happens to be what Mike and I do for a living...
So, what are you going to do?
Well, what do you think I'm going to do? Quit in protest? I'm not going to do that.
Well, what do you think I'm going to do? Quit in protest? I'm not going to do that.
You're taking "no" for an answer?
You're taking "no" for an answer?
No. I'm not going to take "no" for an answer. No.
No. I'm not going to take "no" for an answer. No.
Then what are you going to do?
I'm staying right here. Doing my job. Fighting to get my show on the air. You don't like it? Hey, I'll tell you what... fire my ass...
End up in a high-profile lawsuit with Lowell, the First Amendment martyr? I don't think so. Take a look at this... This is a summary of a dossier that's being prepared.
What the hell are you doing?
What does it look like I'm doing? I'm editing.
What does it look like I'm doing? I'm editing.
No, not that. I'm talking about the Associated Press. They got this story that we pulled this interview and they talked to Mike and I. Did you tell them that we were lying?
No, not that. I'm talking about the Associated Press. They got this story that we pulled this interview and they talked to Mike and I. Did you tell them that we were lying?
No. I should have. I told them I disagreed with you, Mike and Kluster that this segment is as good as the original. I'm not lying for you. I'm not gonna shut up for you. Not on any of it.
No. I should have. I told them I disagreed with you, Mike and Kluster that this segment is as good as the original. I'm not lying for you. I'm not gonna shut up for you. Not on any of it.
Hey! I'm not going to fire you, okay? Take a vacation. Now!
The New York Times ran a blow by blow of what we talked about behind closed doors! You fucked us!
No, you fucked you! Don't invert stuff! Big Tobacco tried to smear Wigand; you bought it. The Wall Street Journal, here, not exactly a bastion of anti-capitalist sentiment, refutes Big Tobacco's smear campaign as the lowest form of character assassination! And now, even now, when every word of what Wigand has said on our show is printed, the entire deposition of his testimony in
There has been so much soul searching about this Wigand, I've decided we should cut an alternate version of the show without his interview.
So, what happened to Ms. Caperelli's checking with outside counsel first, all that crap?
So, what happened to Ms. Caperelli's checking with outside counsel first, all that crap?
That's happening. And, hopefully we won't have to use the alternate, but we should have it in the can.
That's happening. And, hopefully we won't have to use the alternate, but we should have it in the can.
I'm not touching my film...
I'm not touching my film...
I'm afraid you are.
I'm afraid you are.
No, I'm not...
No, I'm not...
We're doing this with or without you, Lowell. If you like, I can assign another producer to edit your show...
So, now, if you'll excuse me, gentlemen, Mr. Rather's been complaining about his chair again. As they start to leave...
Before you go...
And what are you implying?
I'm not implying. I'm quoting. More vested interests... "Persons Who Will Profit From This Merger... Ms. Helen Caperelli, General Counsel of CBS News, 3.9 million. Mr. Eric Kluster, President of CBS News, 1.4 million..."
Did you handle the round, Mr. Wigand?
Yes, I'm afraid I did.
A gun? Yes.
What caliber is your gun?
What caliber is your gun?
What caliber is my gun?
What caliber is my gun?
Yes, sir. What caliber is your gun?
Yes, sir. What caliber is your gun?
What does that have to do with the price of tea in China?
You think I put that bullet in the mailbox myself...?
If we could take a look, Mr. Wigand...
That bullet was for a .38 caliber. Do you own a .38?
Yes, I do. A .38 Target Master. In my gun safe downstairs. A .45 Gold Cup. A .22 target pistol. So what?
Yes, I do. A .38 Target Master. In my gun safe downstairs. A .45 Gold Cup. A .22 target pistol. So what?
Do you have a history of emotional problems, Mr. Wigand?
Do you have a history of emotional problems, Mr. Wigand?
Yes. Yes, I do. Yes, I get extremely emotional when assholes put bullets in my mailbox...!
You can't take that... It's personal property...!
We have a search warrant, Mr. Wigand. There's been a death threat.
We have a search warrant, Mr. Wigand. There's been a death threat.
...my files! Personal correspondence...
That computer has everything...
You alright, Mr. Wigand?
Debbie...
Hey, Lowell.
Oh, Bill... Main Justice is investigating a major New York bank. Laundering narco dollars out of their Mexico City branch. You want it for the Evening News?
What about you, you got a crew already?
What about you, you got a crew already?
I'm gonna do a follow-up.
I'm gonna do a follow-up.
Okay.
Okay.
Catch ya' later.
Shall I send for coffee? Sorry I'm late.
No, no, we're fine...
No, no, we're fine...
Are you sure?
If this holds up, and it very well may not, Mike... but, if it did. And we aired this segment? And CBS was sued by Brown & Williamson? I think we could be at grave risk.
How grave?
How grave?
Well, at the end of the day... because of your segment... the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company... could own CBS.
Mike... Mike... Mike...
"Mike?"
What does that mean? "Rife with -- ?"
I'm told unusual promises were made to Wigand.

Our standards have to be higher than anyone else's, because we are the standard... for everyone else...
Well, as a "standard"... I'll hang with "is the guy telling the truth?"
Well, with tortious interference, I'm afraid... the greater the truth, the greater the damage.
Well, with tortious interference, I'm afraid... the greater the truth, the greater the damage.
Come again?
Come again?
They own the information he's disclosing. The truer it is, the greater the damage to them. If he lied, he didn't disclose their information. And the damages are smaller.

Is this "Alice in Wonderland"?
Is CBS corporate telling CBS News do not go to air with this story?
You're getting ahead of yourself. We're all in this together. We're all CBS. We'll find out soon. Thank you, gentlemen.
Hey, Lowell.
How are you, Jim?
How are you, Jim?
Hey, listen, I hear you guys are sitting on something sensational over there.
Hi, baby.
Catch you later.
How prominent? What kind of placement?
Oh, c'mon, Lowell. This is The New York Times. I don't know...
Oh, c'mon, Lowell. This is The New York Times. I don't know...
Well, until you do, all I can tell you is what you already know... they will not air an interview.
Well, until you do, all I can tell you is what you already know... they will not air an interview.
Call me back in ten.
Hello?
Jim, it's Lowell.
Here's how it works. You ask me questions. I tell you if you're wrong.
Okay. Lowell?
Okay. Lowell?
Yeah?
Yeah?
You're sure you want to do this?
You're sure you want to do this?
Why?
Why?
Hey, it doesn't work? You've burned your bridges, man.
Hey, it doesn't work? You've burned your bridges, man.
You ready...?
You ready...?
Okay... About this whistle-blower... Did Mike and Don go along with the corporate decision?
Lowell?
Did I tell you you were wrong?
Did I tell you you were wrong?
No. I'm assuming the cave-in begins with the threat of litigation from Big Tobacco. Are we talking... are we talking Brown & Williamson, here?
I can take her.
Don't you have to be at the office?
Don't you have to be at the office?
Is there any more rice...?

Yes, it's on the stove...

What are we supposed to do...? What about our medical coverage; what about our health? What about our car payments? The payments on this house?
There's a severance agreement... It includes cash payouts over time and continuing medical coverage... Sure you don't need anything?
No, thank you.
What's going on?
I told him that you had an E-mail death threat that said if you didn't shut the "F" up, they were going to kill you...
...taping? What are you taping?
I'm doing an interview.
I'm doing an interview.
An interview! Do you know what they will do to us...! I thought... Sorry.
Please don't wash your hands in the sink.
Where should I wash them?

What's the difference...

That's for food.
I don't think I can do this... I want to stand by my husband... I really do, Jeffrey. But I don't think I can do this anymore. I am so sorry...

Let me call you back...
No classes this morning?
Will he go on-camera and talk about the Mexico City branch?
Will independent sources corroborate that?
Hello? Yeah...
Let me see this... No, 'cause I gotta know where you're going at all times.
I can't... I've got to fly to Boston tomorrow.
Two p.m. Great. Bye-bye.
..."ignition propensity?" ...you understand any of this...?
...no... this looks like a table of temperatures... Who's this from?
...it's anonymous. References to "P.M." It's got to be Philip Morris, huh?

I have to take a shower.

They're killing the Wigand interview...

I'm alone on this...

Oh, baby...
Jeffrey Wigand...
Jeffrey...
"I'm Lowell Bergman, I'm from '60 Minutes.'" You know, you take the "60 Minutes" out of that sentence, nobody returns your phone call. Maybe Wigand's right. Maybe I'm hooked. What am I hooked on? The rush? "60 Minutes"? What the hell for? Infotainment. It's so fucking useless, all of it.

I got perspective.

No, you do not.

From my perspective, what's been going on and what I've been doing is ridiculous. It's half-measures.

Who is this?
Is it too late?
No. No, it's okay... How's -- how's the new place?
Oh, my God.
You're not even on this anymore... What do you care?
You're not even on this anymore... What do you care?
Jeff! Wake the fuck up! Everybody is on the line here. If they can catch you in a lie, they can paint everything with that brush. Do you understand? Everything you say!
Yes, I'm right here. Could you call me back on a hard line?
Alright.
Alright.
Area code 212-555-0199.
Area code 212-555-0199.
I'll call you then.
...you filed a lawsuit against tobacco on behalf of the State of Mississippi, did you not?
That's right...
That's right...
Well, I'm working with someone, now, who was the former head of research at Brown & Williamson, a former corporate officer there.
Well, I'm working with someone, now, who was the former head of research at Brown & Williamson, a former corporate officer there.
What's your interest in this, Mr. Bergman?
What's your interest in this, Mr. Bergman?
Well, he may tape an interview with us. And, we believe if his testimony showed up in a court record first, it would free him up from his confidentiality agreement and give him some protection.
Has he decided to go public? Because let me tell you, we've been doing this for three years now, and we've worked with a lot of corporate cases involving whistle-blowers, so we know... Big Tobacco will do everything in their power to stop him. So, is your man truly committed?
Well, actually, no. Well, he's on the fence. That's the point.
Well, we'd certainly be interested in making his acquaintance, but without knowing what he's going to do...
Well, would you want him to call you? Or, you want to call him? How do you want to do it?
Well, would you want him to call you? Or, you want to call him? How do you want to do it?
It would be better if he called us.
It would be better if he called us.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Alright?
Alright?
Okay. Thank you.
Yeah, I'm here.
What chance is there of getting Jeff's interview on the air...?
...I'd be lying to you if I did not tell you how important it was in the court of public opinion...
...and I'd be lying to you if I didn't tell you, I'm about out of moves, Dick...
...and I'd be lying to you if I didn't tell you, I'm about out of moves, Dick...
All right. See you...
We're there.
Good, well ask him if Arabic is his second language.

Don't interpret that! Hold it. Hold it. Hold it! Slow, slow!! Sheikh, do you mind... if you would just turn your chair a little bit to face Mr. Wallace?
...come in earlier on Mike's Marine barracks line when he's talking to Sheikh Mussawi...
You eating with us?
You eating with us?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Bring a tie so they'll let us in the front door...
He referred to this... the Seven Dwarfs...
What "Seven Dwarfs?"
What "Seven Dwarfs?"
The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco... Referred to this... Said they should be afraid of him... I assume, afraid of what he could reveal. Now, you tell me. What does this guy have to say that threatens these people?
Well, it isn't "cigarettes are bad for you"...
Hardly new news.
Hardly new news.
No shit.
No shit.
What's this?
Okay, let's look through the looking glass the other way...
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
We got a guy... who wants to talk but he's constrained. What if he were "compelled"?
We got a guy... who wants to talk but he's constrained. What if he were "compelled"?
Oh, torture? Great ratings.
So, is everything okay?
How are the rooms? Comfortable?
Thank you for saying that...
Do you think we could talk about the taping? Tomorrow's taping, just so we can get it out of the way and order...
Do you think we could talk about the taping? Tomorrow's taping, just so we can get it out of the way and order...
Yeah, well, questions will go toward what work you did there, why you were fired. And others will deal...
Oh, man.
Who are these people?
Who are these people?
Ordinary people! Under extraordinary pressure, Mike. What the hell do you expect? Grace and consistency?
It went great in Mississippi, Mike.
Good.
I think what we're trying to tell you is that it happens all the time. This is a news organization. People are always telling us things they shouldn't. We have to verify if it's true and in the public interest... And if it is, we air it.
After we corroborate it. That's why we've never lost a lawsuit and run a classy show. Anything else?
I discovered this. SEC filing... For the sale of the CBS Corporation to Westinghouse Corporation.
What?
Lowell.
"Put the corporation at risk"...? Give me a fucking break!

I'm with Don on this.
I've been banished. In lieu of being fired.
I took off on Tisch. I took off on corporate. They'll know they're not going to see everything on Sunday night...
I took off on Tisch. I took off on corporate. They'll know they're not going to see everything on Sunday night...
I don't know. How does that get Wigand on the air?
I don't know. How does that get Wigand on the air?
Do me a favor, will you? Spare me, for God's sake. Get in the real world. What do you think? I'm going to resign in protest? To force it on the air? The answer is "no." I don't plan to spend the end of my days wandering in the wilderness of National Public Radio. That decision I've already made.
Yeah.
You disappeared on me. How long you staying?
You disappeared on me. How long you staying?
I disappeared on you?
I disappeared on you?
Alright. What did you think?
Alright. What did you think?
I think it was a disgrace.
Did I get you up?
No, I usually sit around in my hotel room, dressed like this at 5:30 in the morning, sleepy look on my face.
How many shows have we done? Huh? C'mon, how many?
Oh, lots.
Oh, lots.
Yeah, that's right.
Yeah, that's right.
But in all that time, Mike, did you ever get off a plane, walk into a room, and find that a source for a story changed his mind? Lost his heart? Walked out on us? Not one fucking time! You want to know why?
But in all that time, Mike, did you ever get off a plane, walk into a room, and find that a source for a story changed his mind? Lost his heart? Walked out on us? Not one fucking time! You want to know why?
I see a rhetorical question on the horizon.

Give me a break!
Give me a break!
No, you give me a break! I never left a source hung out to dry, ever. Abandoned. Not 'til right fucking now! When I came on this job, I came with my word intact. I'm gonna leave with my word intact.

Like what? Corporate responsibility? What, are we talking celebrity here?
I'm not talking celebrity, vanity, CBS. I'm talking about when you're nearer the end of your life than the beginning. Now, what do you think you think about then? The future? "In the future I'm going to do this? Become that?" What "future"? No. What you think is: how will I be regarded in the end? After I'm gone.
Mike... in my...
You and I have been doing this together for fourteen years.
That Canada story? Still interest you?
Everything interests me.
C'mon, it all worked out. You came out okay in the end...
I did? What do I tell a source on the next tough story? Hang in with us. You'll be fine... maybe?
Coffee?
Yeah... Thank you.
Yeah... Thank you.
How have you liked your stay?
How have you liked your stay?
What I've seen... I've liked.
Please to explain, why I should agree to interview... with pro-Zionist American media?
Because I think Hezbollah is trying to broaden into a political party right now. So you care about what you're thought of in America. And in America, at this moment in time, Hezbollah does not have a face. That's why.
Perhaps you prove journalism objectivity and I see the questions first. Then I decide if I grant the interview.
No. We don't do that. You've seen "60 Minutes" and Mike Wallace. So you know our reputation for integrity and objectivity. You also know we are the highest-rated, most-respected, TV-magazine news show in America.
Tell him I will see him day after tomorrow.
That's good. That works. Uh, you know, I want to ask you something... I know it sounds odd... but...
Who's that?
That's room service. They usually knock first. Come on in... Over here, please.
How do you like your coffee? Black?
Black, black...

How did a radical journalist from Ramparts Magazine end up at CBS?
...but that's as far as I go...
Far as you go where?
Far as you go where?
This issue is a drop in the bucket. I can talk to you about what's in here. But I can't talk to you about anything else.
Doesn't CBS have confidentiality agreements, Mr. Bergman?
Between journalists and management, yes, I believe they do... but I don't take that seriously. Where do you work?

That, you have to discuss with CBS Business Affairs. But, for something like this, I would say anywhere between 10, 12 thousand.
Should I just take the documents now?
If you want to do it.

You came all the way down here to tell me that?
No. I did not. Big Tobacco is a big story. And you got something important to say. I can tell. But, yes. I did. I came all the way down here to tell you: story, no story, fuck your story, I don't burn people.
And, I'm unemployed. So I have to protect my medical coverage. ...so I left them a message this morning. Their expanded confidentiality agreement? I will sign it.
They're afraid of you, aren't they?

Okay, so, here you are... you go to work for tobacco. You come from corporate cultures where research, really, creative thinking, these are core values. You go to tobacco...

I can't talk about it. The work I was supposed to do... might have had some positive effect. I don't know... it could have been beneficial. Mostly, I got paid a lot. I took the money. My wife was happy. My kids had good medical. Good schools. Got a great house. I mean, what the hell is wrong with that...?
I've always thought of myself... as a man of science. That's what's wrong with it.
Then... you're in a state of conflict, Jeff.
The new place? New.
You okay?
You know, I was thinking of calling you tomorrow, anyway. How are your kids handling the new house?
Good. You have kids?
No, you said you were going to call me tomorrow. So, what about?
Oh, yes, yes, yes, I did... I wanted to talk to you. I wanted to hook up and talk to you. About what we were talking about in your car.

Hello. You there
Yeah... Look, thanks for talking. I'm sorry I woke you up.

I drink. A couple of occasions more than I should have. I was cited for shoplifting once. But it was a mistake... I pushed Liane one time. We were both stressed out because of the pressure. She went to her mother's. I got fired because when I get angry I have difficulty censoring myself. And I don't like to be pushed around!

Maybe that's just what you've been telling yourself all these years to justify having a good job? Having status? And maybe for the audience, it's just voyeurism? Something to do on a Sunday night. And maybe it won't change a fucking thing. And people like myself and my family are left hung out to dry. Used up! Broke, alone!

They do this with impunity!

They get to go home at night. What does it cost these people to do this to us? Nothing?! My girls are crying, so fuck them! I want to tape! I'm done thinking about it.
Good. But Jeff...
I'll call them, Lowell.
Liane, this is a preliminary... You didn't tell her we were taping? What did she think she was coming to New York for?
...to talk about it. To think about it. I had a plan to ease her into it. But, I really -- I didn't know how to do that...
Lowell, I can't afford --
...they "volunteered." A friend owns a large security company.

"Part of the reason I'm here is I felt that their representation clearly, at least within..."
Run that Sandefur piece on "nicotine's not addictive." Run that on-camera. Then cut right to Wigand with "I believe they perjured..." Then go wide to the CEOs all taking the oath. Back on Jeff and play the pause after the word "felt" on the B-side...
I don't know how to say this, Jeff, except to just say it right out, so I'll say it. They do not want to air it.
What?!

Oh, you know what we do or do not need to know? Since when have you become a media expert?
What do you want to do, Lowell, look up my ass, too...!
I told the truth!
Everything... you... say! And I can't defend you, man, with one hand tied behind my back! Because you keep from me... what they can discover. And they will discover everything! Believe me.
...I was young. I was young... confused... We didn't handle it the right way...
She sued you for back payments of child support?

A can opener! A $39.95 can opener. I canceled payment... It was junk. You ever bounce a check, Lowell? You ever look at another woman's tits? You ever cheat a little on your taxes? Whose life, if you look at it under a microscope, doesn't have any flaws...?
That's the whole point, Jeffrey. That's the whole point. Anyone's. Everyone's. They are gonna look under every rock, dig up every flaw, every mistake you've ever made. They are going to distort and exaggerate everything you've ever done, man. Don't you understand?
What does this have to do with my testimony?

You manipulated me into this...!
That's bullshit, Jeff!

No, no. Don't call the police! Just tell him I'm on the phone with you... My name is Lowell Bergman... Just tell him that.
Did he hear you?
You're breaking up. I can't hear you.
What about now?
What?
What?
Hello, can you hear me now?
What's happening?!
He doesn't seem to be listening...

Just give me an example...
For example. James Burke, the CEO of Johnson & Johnson... when he found out that some lunatic had put poison in Tylenol bottles, he didn't argue with the FDA... He didn't even wait for the FDA to tell him. He just pulled Tylenol off every shelf of every store right across America. Instantly. And then he developed the safety cap... Because, look, as a
We have a couple. One's hers, one's mine. Everybody uses a different name. Modern marriage. How's Liane?
She's okay.
Hold on a minute, Lowell... ...somebody... may be following me. I don't know. They came on the property...
What do you mean followed you? Did you call the police?

I don't want to be paranoid... I mean, maybe it's a game. Some kind of mind game.

Well, what do you really think, though?
Well, what do you really think, though?
I don't know what the fuck I really think! Are they doing it? Is some crank doing it? Are they doing it to make me feel paranoid? Are they doing it for real and don't give a shit what I think? I don't know! I don't fucking know.
Well, no, look... I mean, there was a footprint. Forget it. It's probably not important at all. You know, I got a job now. I'm teaching high school. Japanese and Chemistry. So, what were you calling about?
You called me.
What are you talking about?
Someone put a bullet in my mailbox.
I heard you. But I got to arrange a legal defense first. I got to get you to testify in court, get it on public record.
Then hold it off the air until you got that. But I want to go to New York. And I want to go on the record. Right now!
Jeffrey, how are you? How's the family, okay?
There is -- there is no family.
There is -- there is no family.
What do you mean there is no family?

Liane has filed for divorce...
And, so, I moved out... I see the girls a couple of days a week...
Where you staying now?

Good to meet you, Dr. Wigand.

You heard Mr. Sandefur say before Congress that he believed nicotine was not addictive...?
...I believe Mr. Sandefur perjured himself because I watched those testimonies very carefully.
All of us did. There was this whole line of people... whole line of CEOs up there all swearing.
Part of the reason I'm here is I felt that their representation clearly misstated, at least within Brown & Williamson's representation, clearly misstated... what is common language within the company... we are in the nicotine delivery business.

The process is known as "impact boosting..." While not spiking nicotine, they clearly manipulate it. There's extensive use of this technology, know as "ammonia chemistry." It allows for the nicotine to be more rapidly absorbed in the lung and therefore affect the brain and central nervous system.

The straw that broke the camel's back for me and really put me in trouble with Sandefur was a compound called "coumarin." When I came on board at B&W, they had tried to transition from coumarin to a similar flavor that would give the same taste, and had been unsuccessful. I wanted it out immediately. I was told that it would affect sales, so

Oh, you got rights and lefts! Ups and downs and middles! So what?! You don't get to instruct anything around here! This is not North Carolina, not South Carolina nor Kentucky. This is the sovereign State of Mississippi's proceeding. Wipe that smirk off your face! Dr. Wigand's deposition will be part of this record. And I'm going to take my witness' testimony! Whether the

My co-counsel, Ron Motley, and I have filed a lawsuit against the tobacco industry on behalf of the State of Mississippi to get the state reimbursed Medicaid costs for treating people with smoking-related illness. If you'd be interested in talking to us, we'd certainly like to talk to you...

When should we do this?
Jail?
Possibly, yes. That is one of the possible consequences of your testifying here today. That's right...
Possibly, yes. That is one of the possible consequences of your testifying here today. That's right...
How does one... "go... to... jail?" What does my family do? Go on welfare? If my wife has to work? Who's going to look after the kids? Put food on the table? My children need me. If I'm not teaching... there's no medical... no medical... even on co- pay, that's like... Tuition...
Jeff's a premiere golfer... What are you, a two handicap?
Seven...
Seven...
And, he gets out there and he has five strokes on us. He has more concentration than anybody I've ever met. It's spooky how he can concentrate.

I'd rather play than talk about it. What did you want to see me about? I don't like being back here.
Jeffrey says exactly what's on his mind. Most people consider what they're saying... social skills... Jeffrey just charges right ahead. Now, I know you understood the nature of the confidentiality portion of your severance agreement with Brown & Williamson, Jeff...
Chapter and verse.
Chapter and verse.
Yeah, I know you do... You know, I came up through sales. One of the reasons I was a great salesman, was I never made a promise I couldn't keep. I knew that if I ever broke my promise I'd suffer the consequence...
Is that a threat?
...we worked together for, what was it, three years...? Now, the work we did here is confidential, not for public scrutiny... any more than are one's family matters...

Okay. I don't believe you can maintain corporate integrity without confidentiality agreements. I was paid well for my work. The health and welfare benefits are good. The severance package is fair. I have no intention of violating my confidentiality agreement and disclosing that which I said I wouldn't.

I appreciate all that, Jeff. But, upon reflection... we've decided to expand our zone of comfort with you.
Yes. Your husband did show remarkable foresight in taking those pictures. And, yes, absent a swimming pool, the presence of the pool man would appear to be suspicious. But Bonnie, who is the real victim here? Let me suggest the following. Your husband, who on a prior occasion slapped you -- beat you --
Well, I wouldn't say --
Well, I wouldn't say --
Your husband, who has beaten you -- repeatedly --

So he says now! But if not for your cool headed intervention, his tantrum might have ended this schmoe's life and ruined his own... As for the sexual indiscretion which he imagined had taken place, wasn't it in fact he who had been sleeping with the pool man?
Miles, how nice of you to see us -- may I introduce Howard D. Doyle of Doyle Oil.
I told you we know each other, baby. Mr. Massey represented my ex-brother- in law. Martin Reiser?
Yeah. I know. Leather would be more practical, but whatcha gonna do?
Miles, I know you're busy and that you charge by the hour so I'll come to the point. Howard and I are planning to marry.
Sixteen years? Howard Jr. is fourteen and Mandy must be what -- twelve?
Here. Got pictures.
Honey, I don't think this is really relevant to...
...and one day, this sweet girl calls me, asks me to lunch. Just a shoulder to cry on deal. One thing leads to another and before I know it --
...and one day, this sweet girl calls me, asks me to lunch. Just a shoulder to cry on deal. One thing leads to another and before I know it --
-- we realized we'd always been very attracted to one another.
Baby. You are so HOT!
Howard!
As you are well aware, my previous marriage ended with an unjustified strain on my reputation My motives were questioned. I was slandered in court.
You did good, Massey!
You did good, Massey!
Therefore in an effort to remove any trace of suspicion from my sweet Howard -- I wish to execute a pre- nuptial agreement.

She said "penetrate." Heh heh heh.
Course I can't do much "wriggling" if you tie me up like that again. Massey -- this is one bad bad little girl.
We'd better go before we get thrown out.
Oh. Right. Won't you have a seat?
After you, Doll.
And how is Mrs. Reiser?
Few suicide attempts, little inpatient stint. Naturally, she misses her kids. Six weekends a year and alternate Yom Kippurs seemed harsh to us but -- hey -- all's fair. Anyhoo, she lives with a "nurse," takes her meds and goes to occupational therapy at a local sheltered workshop.

She makes felt wallets. Got one right here.
Muh -- Well, uh -- Huh?
Yep. My divorce just came through. Shoulda called you. Coulda cut a better deal! My wife still has health insurance and gets to see the children. But, I don't know. Guess I'm just a softie. After all Amanda and me were together for -- what -- you'd know better than me, Marylin. She was your best friend.
I... uh guess congratulations are in order.
Well -- Marylin and Rex broke up and...
No!
I had no idea until after, but --
What a touching story.
You know, Miles, after my wife -- wife's mastectomy -- things were never the same. This might sound cold, well, maybe not to you, Massey, but... I like my women with two boobs.
Harvard? Whoa, Daddy!
I just want to make sure that you both --
-- understand what you're asking for here. The Massey pre-nup provides that in the event of a dissolution of the marriage for any reason, both parties shall leave it with whatever they brought in, and earned during. No one can profit from the marriage. The pre-nup protects the wealthier party.
Well -- at the moment, that'd be me.

I'm sorry. That was unkind and -- but, we changed our minds. Did you really mean what you said on the phone. It wasn't because you found out about Rex?
Lemme tell you something. You are the pestilence. I'm the exterminator.
Oh Joe, be happy for us. I'll pay you the twenty thousand.

They won't get a conviction. The husband called it in as a suicide. The forensic guys weren't thinking murder. I'm sure some of the evidence was compromised.

I can't have a baby with a man I don't love... And I can't submit a child to divorce.
It was like that scene in The Godfather. Frankie Pentangeli is called to testify against the Family. And he's in court, and he looks into the spectators gallery, and sees his Brother. They brought the brother from Sicily. And Frankie can't say a word. He can't testify. That's what it was like seeing Pat in there. I couldn't even have Ruth cross examine her.
Why do you think she did it?

Maybe she wanted a free trip to LA. Maybe they offered her money. Massey is very seductive. Who knows.

You're vulnerable.
It's about time.
You said 'yes' didn't you?

Is Tong older than Ming?

Well. He said to "make the house mine."
Oh boy. If he only knew.

Yeah. I guess. You know --
It sounded like a bell.
I'll be right back.

And you must be Mr. Massey.
How nice.
Positano is beautiful. Remember when we were there, Rex? We stayed in the Santo Pietro? That hotel on the cliff?
These are yours.
Not according to Mrs. Rabinow.
I assume this is on Rex?
Isn't everything?
Your husband told me you were beautiful, but I was unprepared.
"Dismiss your vows, your feigned tears, your flattery, for where a heart is hard, they make no battery."
Do you have a hard heart, Marylin.

All right, Miles. Let me tell you everything you THINK you know. I was married to Rex for a long time. I was an excellent wife, a partner, a lover, a hostess and a friend. There was only one thing I did wrong during the five years we were together. I got five years older. Think he should be able to ditch me for

And you've always loved him?
And you hoped to spend the rest of your life with him?
Yes. Why is that so difficult for you to understand?
He'll regret this.
Have you ever met Mr. Rexroth?
Oh, for the love of...
That is true, isn't it Miles? Your pre-nup is the best there is?

No. You listen to me. You busted me, Miles. You left me with nothing! What did you expect me to do? Get a degree in counseling? Write a book about table linen? Because that's what wives do when they get dumped, and frankly, I'm not quite ready for that.

I figure a couple of months. That's how long it should take for the ink on the settlement to dry.
It has bones. Be sure to swallow one.
Although knowing you as I do -- there will be no settlement. This time it will be complete and total annihilation.
To victory.
I don't feel victorious Miles. I feel betrayed, abandoned and humiliated. I have pictures of him with another woman...

Wasn't she the Judge at my divorce hearing?
Yes. Short notice you know, but I think there's nice closure to it. Hello Judge Muson. A pleasure as always.
No. Judge -- just a sec. But Marylin, if we sign it, I can't hope to benefit from the marriage.
Oh Miles!
Oh Miles!
What I mean is, your wealth is completely protected.
But?
I want this to be a marriage based on love, trust and community property. That's all I've ever wanted.
I'm sorry. I'm squishing you. I'll move to the...

I think a nursery should be right off the master suite. My parents put mine in the guest house. Apparently they did have a Fisher Price intercom, but my mother turned it off when I was seven months old because I was so --

Now? She's a night manager at McDonalds.
Maybe.
We do have a man for you.
Please. I'm not seeing anyone until this is over. One husband at a time.
I wish I had your discipline.
I don't know what his game is. He dismissed every one of Ruth's proposals. And Sarah, we weren't unreasonable.
Well what does he want?

Yes. It's for your protection, sweetheart. You're the one with the -- the...
-- the coin?
Extinguish?
Should we counsel fear -- or trust? Should we seek to destroy -- or to build? Should we meet our clients' problems with cynicism -- or with love?
Now, Mrs. Banderas. What is your relationship to Mrs. Rexroth.
We don't have much of a relationship anymore. I haven't seen her since before she married Rex. We had some very nice times prior to that. We were quite close.
And how would you define your relationship to Mrs. Rexroth. You know -- you are her...?
Mother?
Hi, Sweetie.
Hard to believe I know. I'm sure you are frequently mistaken for sisters.
No. I haven't. But I've been out of town. Hello, Rex. Hello there.
You were never invited to meet your son-in-law?
You were never invited to meet your son-in-law?
No. Uh uh. I don't think so. Hmm? No. Well... no.
Did you know Mrs. Rexroth was married?
Of course. Of course she was married. What else would she be? Single? I don't think so.
Let me tell you something about Patty.
Who's "Patty."
Who's "Patty."
Oh. That's her name. Patricia. Like mine. I was Pat and she was Patty. But she changed it after seeing "Some Like It Hot." To Marylin. After Marylin Monroe.
Oh. That's her name. Patricia. Like mine. I was Pat and she was Patty. But she changed it after seeing "Some Like It Hot." To Marylin. After Marylin Monroe.
I see. And what were you going to tell us about Patty slash Marylin?
I see. And what were you going to tell us about Patty slash Marylin?
When she was a tiny girl? And people asked her what she wanted to be when she grew up? She never said the usual things little girls say -- like -- nurse -- ballerina -- anchorwoman? She always said -- "When I grow up, I want to be divorced."
Divorce was her childhood aspiration?
Well, not just divorce. She used to say "I want to be divorced from some big dumb rich guy..." And I guess her dream is coming true. I'm happy for you Patty
I've been trying to nail George's for years, but he's very careful. I'll just keep having children. I think I'm pregnant, by the way.
Ramona! Don't get Mia Farrow on us.
Ramona! Don't get Mia Farrow on us.
Three is not Farrow.
Three is not Farrow.
Who's Rex's guy?
George was so impressed he hired him when he divorced his second.
Muriel Rumsey.
It's not so bad these days. Kids like joint custody. Two sets of toys.
Maybe next time.
Thorstenson Gieselensen. He just separated from his third. He's in fish. He is fish.
She's keeping his name. And one of his planes. And all seven of his children
She's keeping his name. And one of his planes. And all seven of his children
And only two are hers.
That doesn't make sense. It's like punishing you for being goal oriented.
Well, you can live here as long as you want. Do you have any plans?
We can't do the impossible, Mr. Andrews.
What I'm asking isn't impossible. My daughter is somewhere between here and Miami. I want her found!

I've put extra men on, all along the way.

It's not enough! Are you certain she's not with King Westley?
It's not enough! Are you certain she's not with King Westley?
No. He's been trailed twenty-four hours a day since this thing started. He can't even get a phone call we don't know about.
No. He's been trailed twenty-four hours a day since this thing started. He can't even get a phone call we don't know about.
I'm worried, Lovington. After all, something might have happened to her.
OhMary
Yes, sir?
Yes, sir?
How is she?
How is she?
Whyuhshe's all right, sir.
Whyuhshe's all right, sir.
What's the matter? Anything wrong?

Oh, no, sir. No different than

Yes. I know. Still in the dumps, huh?
Yes. I know. Still in the dumps, huh?
Yes sir. If you'll excuse me, sirshe sent me for a drink. Andrews stands a moment thoughtfully and then starts up the stairs, following which the scene dissolves to the UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR in front of Ellie's door. Andrews enters and knocks several times. Receiving no response, he gingerly opens the door.
Can't you get them to go any faster? This dissolves to a deserted ROAD, Peter at the wheel of his car. His high spirits find expression in his efforts to sing.
"I found a million dollar baby"
Yeah, but I don't like the idea of walking in on your jamboree . . . Just between you and methose things give me a stiff pain.
You needn't see anybody. You can come directly to my study. I'd appreciate it very much if
You needn't see anybody. You can come directly to my study. I'd appreciate it very much if
Nono. What the deuce do I want to
Mr. Warne?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Come in. Sit down.
I was surprised to get your note. My daughter hadn't told me anything about you. About your helping her.
That's typical of your daughter. Takes those things for granted. Why does she think I lugged her all the way from Miami for the love of it?
That's typical of your daughter. Takes those things for granted. Why does she think I lugged her all the way from Miami for the love of it?
Please understand me. When I say she didn't tell me anything about it, I mean not until a little while ago. She thinks you're entitled to anything you can get.

I sold some drawers and socks, too; I'm throwing those in.
And this is what you wantthirty- nine dollars and sixty cents?

Listen, did anybody ever make a sucker out of you? This is a matter of principle. Something you probably wouldn't understand. When somebody takes me for a buggy ride I don't like the idea of having to pay for the privilege.

You were taken for a buggy ride?

Yeahwith all the trimmings. Now, how about the check. Do I get it?
Here you are. Do you mind if I ask you something frankly? Do you love my daughter?
A guy that'd fall in love with your daughter should have his head examined.

That's an evasion.
That's an evasion.
She grabbed herself a perfect running mate. King Westley! The pill of the century! What she needs is a guy that'd take a sock at her every daywhether it's coming to her or not.
If you had half the brains you're supposed to have, you'd have done it yourselflong ago.
Do you love her?
Do you love her?
A normal human being couldn't live under the same roof with her, without going nuts. She's my idea of nothing!

I asked you a question. Do you love her?
I asked you a question. Do you love her?
Yes! But don't hold that against me. I'm a little screwy myself.
What's this about not eating?
I don't want to eat! And there's one more thing I don't want! Definitely! That's to see you.
Know what my next move is? No more cigarettes.
Why don't you put me in chains?
Why don't you put me in chains?
I might.
I might.
All right! Put me in chains! Do anything you want! But I'm not going to eat a thing until you let me off this boat!
Come on, Ellie. Stop being silly. You know I'm going to have my way.
I won't stand for it! I won't stand for your running my life! Why do you insist on it!
I won't stand for it! I won't stand for your running my life! Why do you insist on it!
You ought to know why. Because

Why not? Look what he's doing for aviation. It takes courage to do what he does. And character! At least he's accomplished something worthwhile. I suppose you'd like to have me marry a business man. Well, I hate business menparticularly if you're a shining example.
Your whole life is devoted to just one thing. To accumulate more money. At least there's romance in what he's doing.
He's no good, Ellie, and you know it. You married him only because I told you not to.
He's no good, Ellie, and you know it. You married him only because I told you not to.
You've been telling me what not to do since I was old enough to remember. I'm sick of it!

What's the matter, Ellie? What's wrong?
Nothing.
Nothing.
You've been acting so strangely since you returned. I'mI'm worried. I haven't bothered to ask you any questionsI Isn't all this what you wanted? You haven't changed your mind about King, have you?

Oh, no.
Oh, no.
If you have, it isn't too late. You know how I feel about him. But I want to make you happy. You gave me such a scareIwhen I couldn't find you. You know, the old pump isn't what it used to be.

It doesn't matter. I don't want to stir up any more trouble. I've been doing it all my life. I've been such a burden to youmade your life so miserableand mine, too. I'm tired, Dad. Tired of running around in circles. He's right, that's what I've been doing ever since I can remember.
Yes, I guess I have. I don't want to hurt anybody any more. I want to get away from all this front page publicity. It suddenly strikes me as being cheap and loathsome. I can't walk out on King now. It'll make us all look so ridiculous. Besides, what difference does it make? I'll never see Peter again.
Is that his name?
Is that his name?
Yes. Peter Warne.

I'm sorry you read it.
I'm sorry you read it.
Are you going to see him?
Are you going to see him?
I suppose so.
I suppose so.
Certainly! Pay him off. He's entitled to it. He did an excellent job. Kept me thoroughly entertained. It's worth every penny he gets.
I'll be going. Ellie swallows her drink and starts pouring herself another, as King enters.
Well, if it isn't the groom himself! You're just in time, King.
might have been able to help if it weren't for you. I've been watched so closely, I
Yes. I know. Well, you can help now. I issued a statement yesterday that I've withdrawn my objections. Begging her to come home. I haven't heard from her. Apparently she doesn't trust me.

Why should she? After all
Why should she? After all
All right. That's why I sent for you. There's a room full of reporters out there. I want you to make a statementthat you've had a talk with methat we've reached an understandingthat if Ellen comes home, I won't interfere with your marriage. Will you do that?

What a hell cat. No controlling these modern girls. They're terrible!

I haven't changed my mind, Westley, I want you to understand that! I don't like you! I never have! I never will! That's clear enough, isn't it?
You've made that quite evidentwith all your threats of annulment. Well, it hasn't bothered me for a minute. Ellie and I got married because we love each other. And she's proving it; as far as I'm concerned there's going to be no annulment.

You've got a good thing and you're hanging on to it, huh? All right, You win. I'll just have to get used to you. I admit I'm licked. But only because I'm worried. I've had detectives all over the country searching for her. I've seen thousands of photographs. Fortune tellers, nuts, every crank in the country has written me. Haven't slept one night this

No? Say, listenI've devoted a whole lifetime trying to tame that wildcat. Toughest job I ever tackled. Ever hear of J.P. Clarkson? Biggest man in the country, isn't he? Well, I tamed him . Got him eating out of the palm of my hand. I've browbeaten financiers, statesmen, foreign ministerssome of the most powerful people in the worldbut I've never been able to do

Ooooooh. Hello my would-be ex-son-in-law. I've sent you a check for a hundred thousand. Yes. That's the smartest thing you ever did, Westley, not to contest that annulment. That's satisfactory, isn't it? Yeah. Well, it ought to be. Oh I'm not complaining. It was dirt cheap. Don't fall out of any windows.

I am. I only work when I have to. Two years ago I got a notion and went to China. There was a war going on. Swell! After a while it got stale. I went down to Tahiti. Just lay on the beach for six months. What could be sweeter?
Doesn't sound very exciting.
What are you thinking about?
By a strange coincidence, I was thinking of you.

Really?

Yeah. I was just wondering what makes dames like you so dizzy.

What'd you say we're supposed to be doing?
What'd you say we're supposed to be doing?
Hitch-hiking.
Hitch-hiking.
Well, you've given me a very good example of the hiking
If it's just the same to you, we'll sit right here till they come. Got a toothpick?
No. But I've got a penknife.
No. But I've got a penknife.
Hayin my teeth.
There it is. Better swallow it. We're not going to have any breakfast.
Needn't rub it in. What're you eating?
Needn't rub it in. What're you eating?
Carrots.
Carrots.
Raw?
Raw?
Uh-huh. Want one?
Uh-huh. Want one?
No!! It's a wonder you couldn't get me something I can eat.
No!! It's a wonder you couldn't get me something I can eat.
You don't think I'm going around panhandling for you. Best thing in the world for youcarrots. Had a tough time getting them. If that farmer ever caught megoodnight!

I hate the horrid stuff.
I wish you wouldn't talk too much. We let a car get away.
What if nobody stops for us?

Oh, they'll stop, all right. It's a matter of knowing how to hail them.

You think it's simple, huh?
You think it's simple, huh?
Oh, no!
Oh, no!
Well, it is simple. It's all in the thumb, see? A lot of people do it
But the thumb always works. Different ways to do it, though. Depends on how you feel. For instance, number one is a short, jerky movement That shows independence. You don't care if they stop or not. 'Cause you got some money in your pocket, see?
Clever.
Clever.
Number two is a wider movementa smile goes with that onelike this. That means you got a couple of brand new stories about the farmer's daughter.[12]

You figured that all out yourself, huh?

Oh, that's nothing. Now take number three, for instance. That's a pip. It's the pathetic one. When you're brokeand hungryand everything looks black. It's a long movement like this with a follow through.

Amazing.
Amazing.
Hm? Yeah, but it's no good if you haven't got a long face with it.
Here comes a car!
Now watch me. I'm going to use Number One. Keep your eye on that thumb, baby, and see what happens.
Something must have gone wrong. I guess I'll try number two.
When you get up to a hundred, wake me up.
I guess maybe I won't write that book after all.
Yes. But look at all the fun you had. Mind if I try?
Yes. But look at all the fun you had. Mind if I try?
You! Don't make me laugh.
You! Don't make me laugh.
You're such a smart aleck! Nobody can do anything but you. I'll show you how to stop a carand I won't use my thumb.
What're you going to do?
Mind your own business.
You might give me a little credit.
What for?
What for?
I proved once and for all that the limb is mightier than the thumb.

Why not? I'm hungry.

Eat a carrot.

Never! I'm going in and ask him

What'd you give him for the car?
What'd you give him for the car?
A black eye.
You don't have to eat the carrots. Just passed a pond with some ducks in it.
Darling!
Any luck?
Yeah. He finally agreed to let us have a room.
Yeah. He finally agreed to let us have a room.
What about money?

Talked him out of it. He thinks we're going to stay a week. I'll have to think of something before morning.
Talked him out of it. He thinks we're going to stay a week. I'll have to think of something before morning.
That's swell!
That's swell!
I'm glad you think so. If you ask me, it's foolish. I told you there's no sense in our staying here tonight. We could make New York in less than three hours.
I'm glad you think so. If you ask me, it's foolish. I told you there's no sense in our staying here tonight. We could make New York in less than three hours.

Okay. Cottage Number Three.
Yes. You'll have a great story, won't you?
Yeah, swell.
Thank you. Am I going to see you in New York?
Nope.
Nope.
Why not?
Haven't you ever wanted to fall in love?
Me?
Me?
Yes. Haven't you thought about it at all? Seems to me you could make some girl wonderfully happy.
Yes. Haven't you thought about it at all? Seems to me you could make some girl wonderfully happy.
Maybe. Suresure, I've thought about it. Who hasn't? If I ever met the right sort of a girl, I'd Yeah, but where you going to find hersomebody that's realsomebody that's alive? They don't come that way any more.
Better go back to your bed.
I love you.
I love you.
You're forgetting you're married.
You're forgetting you're married.
I don't care. I love you. Nothing else matters. We can run away. Everything'll take care of itself. Please, Peter. You can't go out of my life now. I couldn't live without you. Oh, Peter
I hope you got your money.
You bet I did.
You bet I did.
Congratulations.
Congratulations.
Same to you.
Same to you.
Why don't you stay and watch the fun? You'll enjoy it immensely.
Why don't you stay and watch the fun? You'll enjoy it immensely.
I would. But I've got a weak stomach.
Compared to you, my friend, Shapeley's an amateur. Whatever gave you an idea you can get away with this! You're positively the most conceited
Hey, wait a minute! Let's get something straightened out right now. If you've any peculiar ideas that I'm interested in you, forget it. You're just a headline to me.
Hey, wait a minute! Let's get something straightened out right now. If you've any peculiar ideas that I'm interested in you, forget it. You're just a headline to me.
A headline? You're not a newspaper man, are you?
I'll bet you're in an awful hurry to get back to New York, aren't you?
Goodnight, Mr. Warne.

I'm out! I'm out!
Maybe I could jump out of the window. Do you think they'd see me?
Come here, you little fool!
There's a man here to see you, Sweetheart.
Whome? Want to see me?
No, it isn't. I'm hungry andand scared.
You can't be hungry and scared at the same time.
You can't be hungry and scared at the same time.
Well, I am.
Comical part of it is, it isn't what you want at all. In a couple of weeks you'll be looking for the nearest exit . . . People like you spend all your life on a merry-go-round. I guess that's what makes you so dizzy. You're always chasing after something. At least you think you are. Truth is, you're just running away. From yourself,
Do you know?
I just want to be let alone, that's all. Life's swell if you don't try too hard. Most people want to get a strangle-hold on it. They're not living. They're just feverish. If they didn't get themselves all balled up with a lot of manufactured values, they'd find what they want. Peace and calm. When you get right down to it, what's all the
You sound like a hobo.
Is that the Walls of Jericho going up?
Yep! The Walls of Jericho.
No harm in your coming to see us.
Not interested.
Not interested.
Won't I ever see you again?
How are you, Ellie? Are you happy?
Happy? Why shouldn't I be happy? I'm getting the handsomest man in captivity. Here you are, King. Let's drink. Let's drink to us . We finally made it, didn't we?
Happy? Why shouldn't I be happy? I'm getting the handsomest man in captivity. Here you are, King. Let's drink. Let's drink to us . We finally made it, didn't we?
You bet we did.
You bet we did.
It's up to you now. I want our life to be full of excitement, King. We'll never let up, will we? Never a dull moment. We'll get on a merry-go-round and never get off. Promise you'll never let me get off? It's the only way to live, isn't it? No time to think. We don't want to stop to think, do we? Just want

Whatever you say, darling.
Whatever you say, darling.
I heard about your stunt. That's swell, King. Just think of itthe groom lands on the lawn with a plane. It's a perfect beginning for the life we're going to lead. It sets just the right tempo. Come on, King. You're lagging.
Where's the bus to New York?
Left twenty minutes ago.
Left twenty minutes ago.
Why, that's ridiculous! I was on that busI told them to wait!
Why, that's ridiculous! I was on that busI told them to wait!
Sorry, Miss. It's gone. Ellie's face clouds. The crowds surge about her. She looks around thoughtfully. Suddenly her eyes open in surprise at something she sees, and the VIEW then moves over to Peter, who sits on his suitcase, looking toward Ellie.
Eight o'clock tonight.
Eight o'clock! Why, that's twelve hours!
Eight o'clock! Why, that's twelve hours!
Sorry, Miss.
Here's your ticket, ma'am.
Oh, thank you. Thank you very much. Here.

What's the matter? Where's your husband, young lady
Husband?
Husband?
Yesif he is your husband.
Yesif he is your husband.
Isn't he here?
Isn't he here?
No, he ain't! And the car's gone, too.
No, he ain't! And the car's gone, too.
Why, he'll be back.
Why, he'll be back.
Yeah? What makes you think so! He took his suitcase and everything. Kinda surprised, huh? It's just like I told you, Zeke. They ain't married a'tall . . .
Why, you can't put me out in the middle of the

But can't you wait until morning
Ain't gonna wait a minute.
Can I use your telephone? I want to talk to New York.
You ain't gonna stick me for no phone calls. You can go down to the Sheriff's office.
You made no mistake sitting next to me. Just between us, the kinda muggs you meet on a hop like this ain't nothing to write home to the wife about. You gotta be awful careful who you hit up with, is what I always say, and you can't be too particular, neither. Once when I was comin' through North Carolina, I got to gabbin'
Seems to me you're doing excellently without any assistance.
Seems to me you're doing excellently without any assistance.
That's pretty good . . . Well, shut my big nasty mouth!
But I don't go in for that kinda stuffmuch. I like to pick my fillies. Take you, for instance. You're my type. No kiddin' sister. I could go for you in a big way. "Fun-on-the-side Shapeley" they call me, and the accent is on the fun, believe you me.
Believe you me, you bore me to distraction.
Hey, what's this? Wearing Papa's things? Now that's cute. That's what I call real lovey-dovey. Yessir.
If you don't get out of here, I'll slap that fresh mouth of yours.

Get out!
Get out!
Okay. I was just trying to make conversation.
Do you mind taking those things off the Walls of Jericho? It's tough enough as it is.
Oh, excuse me.
Oh, by the waywhat's your name?
What's that?
I've been thinking about you.
Yes?
Yes?
You've had a pretty tough break at that. Twice a Missus and still unkissed.
Heyyou not up yet? Come oncome on!
What time is it?
What time is it?
Eight o'clock.
I'm hungry.
Just your imagination.
The old man's screwy!

Mr. Gordon

Did you know he reversed the charges on that call?
Did you know he reversed the charges on that call?
What! Say, listen you! When you get back to New York, take my advice and stay f-a-r away from this officeunless you don't care what happens to that funny map of yours.
Here's another wire from Peter Warne.
Throw it in the basket. What's it say? "Have I got a story! It's getting hotter and hotter. Hope you're the same."
Collect?
Yes.
Yes.
Don't accept any more.
Say, listen, you wouldn't know a story if it reached up and kicked you in the pants. Yeah? Sure, sure, I got your copy. Why didn't you tell me you were going to write it in Greek? I'd start a new department.
That was free verse, you gashouse palooka!
That was free verse, you gashouse palooka!
Free verse, huh? What the dickens was free about it? It cost this paper a gob of dough. Well, I'm here to tell you, it's not gonna cost us any more.

That's okay by me! 'Cause as far as I'm concerned, I'm through with newspapers! See? I'm through with stupidity! I'll never write another newspaper story, for you or anybody else, if I have to starve. Yeah? What about my novel! When I get through with that

Joe, listen
Don't "Joe" me.
Don't "Joe" me.
Okay, Joe. Listenyou know I've always liked you. Anytime I could do you a great turnanytime I ran into a story that looked goodI always came running to you, didn't I? Well, I got one now. Those wires I sent you were on the level. It's the biggest scoop of the year. I'm giving it to you, Joe.

You mean about the Andrews' kid?
You mean about the Andrews' kid?
That's it. I got it all written up. Ready to go. All I want is a thousand dollars.
A thousand dollars! Get out of this office before I throw you out bodily.
Don't get sore, Joe. This is something you got to do for me. I need a thousand dollarsand I need it quick. I'm in a jam.
Don't get sore, Joe. This is something you got to do for me. I need a thousand dollarsand I need it quick. I'm in a jam.

I wouldn't trust you as far as I could throw that desk.
Wait a minute, Joe. Use your bean. I couldn't afford to hand you a phoney yarn, like that. I'd be crazy. There isn't a newspaper in the country'd give me a job after that! I could go to jail!

Now I know you're drunk. I'm going home. Don't annoy me any more.
For heaven's sake, Joestop being an editor for just a minute. We've been friends for a long time, haven't we? You ought to know when I'm serious. This is on the level.
I met her on a bus coming from Miami. Been with her every minute. I'm in love with her, Joe.
Well, I'll be
Well, I'll be
Listen, Palyou've got to get this money for me. Now. Minutes count. She's waiting for me in an auto camp outside of Philadelphia. I've got to get right back. You see, she doesn't know I'm gone. A guy can't propose to a girl without a cent in the world, can he?
Thanks, Pal. You saved my life.
Okay, pete.
'Bye, Agnes. You're beautiful. All women are beautiful! Gordon is immediately electrified into action.
Oh, boy! What a yarn! What a yarn! Get me Hank on the phone. Gotta hold up the morning edition.
Hello, Joe. Sorry. Just a little gag of mine. Thought I'd have some fun with you.
Yeah. Sure. Had me going for a while.
Yeah. Sure. Had me going for a while.
Wouldn't have made a bad story, would it?

That feller last night, that's who! He was gonna stay a week, huh? Well, he's skipped. Took the car with him, too. We wouldn't have known a thing about it until morning if I hadn't took that magnesia. Come on, get up, don't lay there. Let's do something about it.
See that. They're gone!
Looks like it, don't it? Here's the woman, ma.

Nice guy. Just like you. But he made a big mistake, one day. Got kind of talkative. Know what happened? His kid was found in the bottom of the river. A rock tied around its neck. Poor Bugs! He couldn't take it. Blew his brains out.
Gee! That musta been terrible. I guess he had it coming to him though. But don't you worry about me. I don't talk. I never talk. Take my word for it. Gee, I wouldn't want anything to happen to my kids.
Okay. Just remember that. Now beat it.

Sure. Anything you say.
Boss, Oswald impersonators? Sounds like James Bond now.
Al, you can't tell a mink from a coonskin unless you see the fur up close. Goddamn, Sam! If we don't start reading between the lines here! Y'all gotta start thinking on a different level - like the CIA does. We're through the looking glass. Here white is black and black is white.
If this is Oswald, it must be our third Oswald.
The interesting thing is the extent to which the Warren Commission went to make him a Communist. They got almost 150 pages and 130 exhibits of the report on this Mexico trip and the picture doesn't even match. I'm beginning to think the point of the Mexican episode was to lay the blame at Castro's door. If Oswald, or someone purporting to be Oswald,
Susie, watch the language, would you please.
My instinct is that Ferrie is going to keep on deteriorating, and we'll end up getting more out of him when he finally cracks. If we call him now, he might freeze up and we could lose the best shot we've ever had.
I don't care if he was doing it with giraffes in the zoo, Numa, it's none of our business. Let's keep this side of it quiet, shall we?
When you're in a war, boss, you use every weapon you got.
When you're in a war, boss, you use every weapon you got.
Not one word. That's an order.
The U.S. Attorney in Washington "declines" to serve our subpoena on Allen Dulles, Charles Cabell, CIA Director Richard Helms, or any FBI agent we named.
Well, what do you expect from a pig but a grunt.
Well, what do you expect from a pig but a grunt.
Without them, it's going to be near impossible, chief, to prove Shaw's connection to the CIA. We got the same problem with the governors. All of them. Reagan in California won't give us Brading, Ohio refuses Orville Townsend, Texas on Arcacha, and Nebraska on Sandra Moffet.
William Walter, the night clerk on duty here in the FBI office, gave me a copy of this. It went all over the country. Nothing was done, and the motorcade went ahead on schedule - and this wasn't even mentioned in the Warren Report! Read it, Al.
"Threat to assassinate President Kennedy in Dallas, Texas, November 22-23. Information received by the Bureau has determined that a militant revolutionary group may attempt to assassinate President Kennedy on his proposed trip to Dallas, Texas, etc, etc..."
Gentlemen, I will not hear this. I value Bill as much as anyone here. We all need to make room for someone else's ideas, Lou, especially me. Maybe Oswald is what everyone says he is and I'm just plain dumb wrong.
I've seen him copying files, leaving here late at night.
Why you keep dancing on my head for, my man? We been thicker'n molasses pie since law school.
Because you keep conning me, Dean. I read your testimony to the Warren Commission and...
Because you keep conning me, Dean. I read your testimony to the Warren Commission and...
There you go. Grain of salt. Two sides to every coin.

You tell them the day after the assassination you were called on the phone by this "Clay Bertrand" and asked to fly to Dallas and be Lee Oswald's layer.
You tell them the day after the assassination you were called on the phone by this "Clay Bertrand" and asked to fly to Dallas and be Lee Oswald's layer.
Right.
Right.
Now that's pretty important, Dean. You also told the FBI when you met him, he was six foot two. Then you tell the Commission he was five foot eight. How the hell did the man shrink like that, Dean?

They put the heat on, my man, just like you're doing. I gave'em anything that popped into my cabeza. Truth is, I never met the dude.
Yeah, she was pretty, all right, but not half as cute as you, Deano. You shoulda tried a legitimate line of business.
You can't ever say crime don't pay in Louisiana, Jim - only not as good as it used to. Good chowder, ain't it?

When did you first do business with this Bertrand?

Oh, I first heard these street cats jiving about him back in '56, '57 when I lived down in the Quarter.

Street cats?
Street cats?
Swishes. They swish, y'know. Young fags, you know. They'd come into my bureau needing help, no bread, and I'd say, hey man, I ain't Rockefeller, who gonna back you up? These cornmuffins go to the phone and dial...
What was his voice like?
You knew you weren't talking to some low life fag, you know. He had command of the king's English.

So you saw Oswald how many times?
So you saw Oswald how many times?
Three, four. He came in with a few Cubano swishes one time I remember...
Recall any names?
Mario, Jose - they wear names like you and I wear clothes. Today the name is Candy, tomorrow it's Butsie. I wish I could help you, Jim.

Then how the hell did you get in the Warren Commission, Dean? Except through the phone records in the Dallas jail?
Then how the hell did you get in the Warren Commission, Dean? Except through the phone records in the Dallas jail?
There were no phone records.
There were no phone records.
Of course there weren't. 'Cause they disappeared. And yet the Commission found you, Dean.
Of course there weren't. 'Cause they disappeared. And yet the Commission found you, Dean.
I don't know how they got to me. Maybe cause I repped him here. The Feebees run background checks. On my mama's breasts, man, that's all I got. There wasn't no conspiracy, Jim. If there were, why the hell didn't Bobby Kennedy prosecute it as Attorney General, he was his brother for Chrissake. How the fuck three people could keep a secret like that,
All this blubbering over that sonofabitch! They're grieving like they knew the man. It makes me want to puke.
God's sake, chief. The President was shot.
God's sake, chief. The President was shot.
A bullshit President! I don't see any weeping for all the thousands of Cubans that bastard condemned to death and torture at the Bay of Pigs. Where are all the tears for the Russians and Hungarians and Chinese living like slaves in prison camps run by Kennedy's communist buddies - All these damned peace treaties! I'm telling ya Jack, that's what happens when you

Chief, maybe you had a little too much to drink.
Chief, maybe you had a little too much to drink.
Bullshit! Bartender, another round... Here's to the New Frontier. Camelot in smithereens. I'll drink to that.
Well, the kid musta gone nuts, right? I said Oswald must've flipped. Just did this crazy thing before anyone could stop him, right?
I think I'll cut out here, chief. I gotta get home.
I think I'll cut out here, chief. I gotta get home.
Get home my ass. We're going to the office, have another drink. I want some company tonight.
Who'd ever thought that goofy Oswald kid would pull off a stunt like an assassination? Just goes to show, you can never know about some people. Am I right, Jack? Well, bless my soul. Your eyes are as red as two cherries, Jack. Don't tell me we have another bleeding heart here. Hell, all these years I thought you were on my side.
Chief, sometimes I don't know whether you're kidding or not.
Chief, sometimes I don't know whether you're kidding or not.
I couldn't be more serious, Jack. Those big red eyes have me wondering about your loyalty.
Who the hell opened my files! You've been looking through my private files, haven't you, you weasel?
You may not like this, chief, but you're beginning to act paranoid. I mean, you really are.
You may not like this, chief, but you're beginning to act paranoid. I mean, you really are.
You found out about Dave Ferrie going to Texas today and you went through all my files to see what was going on. You're a goddamn spy.

I always lock my files. And you were the only one here today... What do you mean, you son of a bitch?
I always lock my files. And you were the only one here today... What do you mean, you son of a bitch?
You know what I mean. I saw a lot of strange things going on in this office this summer. And a lotta strange people.
Maybe there's more to this, Susie. The CIA's keeping something from our enemies.
Yes, but we're talking about a dead warehouse employee of no political significance. Three years later and he's still classified? They gave us his grammar school records, a study of his pubic hairs... Put it in context, Bill, of what we know about Oswald. Lonely kid, no father, unstable childhood, high school dropout - wants to grow up and be a spy, joins the
I don't know if it's coincidence, but Oswald had a top security clearance and knew about the U2 program from his days at Atsugi Air Base in Japan. Six months after he arrives in Russia, Francis Gary Powers' U2 spy flight goes down in Russia. That plane was untouchable. Powers hinted that Oswald could've given the Russians enough data to hit it. As a
Susie, you're an assistant D.A., remember. Stick to what you can prove in court.
Susie, you're an assistant D.A., remember. Stick to what you can prove in court.
You want facts, Bill? Okay. From 1945 to '59 only two U.S. soldiers defect to Russia. From '59 to '60, seven defect, six return, one of them another Marine a month before Oswald. All of them young men made to seem poor, disenchanted.
Who?
Grab your socks and pull... Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw...
Grab your socks and pull... Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw...
No!... Shaw! Director of The Trade Mart? This is incredible.
Or a cover up! Jesus, Bill, don't you have enough proof of the FBI's complicity now?
Maybe I have a little more respect for this country's institutions than you do, Susie. You tell me how the hell you can keep a conspiracy going between the Mob, the CIA, FBI, and Army Intelligence and who knows what else, when you know you can't even keep a secret in this room between 12 people! We got leaks everywhere! We're going to trial
Bill.
Hey, where y'at, Frank? You're wasting your time here. Big Jim gave strict orders. No FBI allowed.

You've got nothin', Bill. I'm talking as a friend now. You're riding on the Titanic. Time to jump off before you get destroyed along with Garrison.
You've got nothin', Bill. I'm talking as a friend now. You're riding on the Titanic. Time to jump off before you get destroyed along with Garrison.
Frank, I don't want to hear it.
Frank, I don't want to hear it.
Senator Long set your boss up, my friend.
Who do you think fed him that information? Garrison's going down. We're talking your career here, Bill, your life. You're a young guy... we know you're working that Castro thing.
No, I'm not...
No, I'm not...
Yes, you are. Look we know Oswald didn't pull that trigger. Castro did. But if that comes out, there's gonna be a war, boy - millions of people are gonna die. That's a hell of a lot more important than Jim Garrison. Goddammit, look at me when I talk to you! You're too goddamn self- opinionated, now shut up. If you got a brain
Correct me if I'm wrong. I thought we were on the same side. What the hell business is it of theirs to say that?
Pretty fast, wasn't it. The way they let him go.
What do you think, Lou?
I'm just an investigator, Bill. I leave the theories to you lawyers.
I'm just an investigator, Bill. I leave the theories to you lawyers.
You, Numa?
It's addressed to no one and no signature. "To leave this life is, for me, a sweet prospect. I find nothing in it that is desirable and on the other hand, everything that is loathsome."
Pretty flowery for Dave Ferrie.
The fact is he's gone, chief, and so's our case.
Not unless we go for Shaw now.
Not unless we go for Shaw now.
With whose testimony? Willie O'Keefe? A male prostitute. Jack Martini? A drunk? Vernon Bundy? A dope fiend. Shaw's got respect, the newspaper editors, the American Bar Association - they're not...
Yeah. They were seen together in Clinton in early September. The Civil Rights Movement was running a voter registration drive.
...rumor is Shaw, a local boy, was working on some arms deal to discredit the civil rights movement. No one really knows what they were doing there, but everyone sure saw 'em. They stood out like cottonballs. I got whites and blacks saw 'em, but last time I checked there was nothing illegal with registering to vote. We still got the Negro junkie, Vernon

You're not digging.
Clay Bertrand? Sure I know him. He comes around the Quarter.
Who is he, Joe? I've been to every bar, no one wants to talk.
Who is he, Joe? I've been to every bar, no one wants to talk.
I told your uncle I never met a lawman who wasn't a punk. You too, Bill, even if you're family. He's a big shot businessman. I seen him on the TV news a lot with all the other big shots. A fag, you know. Goes by another name down here.

Shaw. Clay Shaw.

Yeah, what's the big mystery? Everybody down here knows the guy.
Yeah, what's the big mystery? Everybody down here knows the guy.
So why does he call himself Bertrand?
So why does he call himself Bertrand?
Who gives a shit what he calls himself?
Clay Bertrand, Willie?
Yeah. Clay. I met him sometime in June of '62 at the Masquerade Bar. Dave Ferrie took me there, for the express reason to meet him.
Did he pay you for this?
Twenty dollars each time. Hell, it's no secret. That's what I'm here for.
...there were about nine or ten people, Cubans, friends of Dave doing some stuff in the bush with him. Place was a mess. Dave's mind was a mess, Y'know he had all those mice cages around cause he's working on this cure for cancer... Dave's smart - real smart - speaks five languages, knows philosophy, medicine, military history, politics. He wanted to be a
And that's where you met Oswald for the first time?
And that's where you met Oswald for the first time?
Yeah, strange guy. Dave introduced him as...
Fuck, yes. Hell, I'm already in jail. I got no reason to lie to you. I ain't no nigger.
Go on, Willie.
Go on, Willie.
...well the party got crazier and crazier, one of those, y'know "beatnik" type things.
Hold your horses. What kinda source?
The anonymous kind, Chief.
Morning, boys. Ready for a walking tour?
At 7:30 Sunday morning? It's not exactly fresh blood we're sniffing here, boss.
At 7:30 Sunday morning? It's not exactly fresh blood we're sniffing here, boss.
Old stains, Bill, but just as telling.
What the hell's a Communist like Lee Oswald doing working out of Banister's?
Y'ever heard of a double agent, Bill? I'm beginning to doubt Oswald was ever a Communist... after the arrest, 544 Camp Street never appeared on the pamphlets again. Now here's another one for you: What would you say if I told you Lee Oswald had been trained in the Russian language when he was a Marine?
Lord, wake me, please. I must be dreaming.
No, you're awake, Bill, and I'm dead serious. And we're going to start by tracking down your anonymous source from three years ago. How did you find out Dave Ferrie drove to Texas that day?
Well, it's a terrific yard, Chief, but the man's an obvious alcoholic with a reputation lower than crocodile piss.
Does that bother you, Bill? I always wondered in court why it is because a woman is a prostitute, she has to have bad eyesight.
Does that bother you, Bill? I always wondered in court why it is because a woman is a prostitute, she has to have bad eyesight.
He'll never sign a statement, boss, let alone get on a witness stand.
He'll never sign a statement, boss, let alone get on a witness stand.
When something's rotten in the land, Bill, it generally isn't just one fish, we'll get corroboration... find this Clay Bertrand. If I were a betting man, I'd give you 10 to 1 it's an alias. Start checking around the Quarter.

And the six of us, with almost no budget and in secret, are going to solve the case that the Warren Commission with dozens of support staff and millions of dollars couldn't solve. We can't keep up with the crimes in the Parish as it is, Chief.

The murder of a President, Bill, is a crime in Orleans Parish too. I didn't pick you because of your legal skill, you know.
The murder of a President, Bill, is a crime in Orleans Parish too. I didn't pick you because of your legal skill, you know.
Gee, thanks boss.
I'm lost, boss. What are we saying here?
We're saying that when Oswald went to Russia, he was not a real defector, that he was an intelligence agent on some kind of mission for our government and he remained one till the day he died, that's what we're saying.
We're saying that when Oswald went to Russia, he was not a real defector, that he was an intelligence agent on some kind of mission for our government and he remained one till the day he died, that's what we're saying.
And therefore because Oswald pulled the trigger, the intelligence community murdered their own commander in chief. That's what you're saying!
And therefore because Oswald pulled the trigger, the intelligence community murdered their own commander in chief. That's what you're saying!
I'll go you one better! Maybe Oswald didn't even pull the trigger, Bill. The nitrate test indicates he didn't even fire a rifle on November 22nd. And on top of that, they didn't even bother to check if the rifle had been fired that day.

He had his palm print on the weapon.
He had his palm print on the weapon.
It went to the goddamn FBI and they didn't find a goddamn thing. It comes back a week later and one guy in the Dallas police department suddenly finds a palm print which for all I know he could've taken off Oswald at the morgue. There's no chain of evidence, Bill. And what about the tow guns actually seen in the Depository? One an
But why?
To frame him, obviously. You got to get in your minds how the hell spooks think, Bill! They're not ordinary crooks.
I still have to question what the legal basis is that supports this, boss. Susie's stuff is colorful, but...
Let's start making some assumptions about the man. Why would he leave a path as big as Lee Harvey Oswald's? This is not a thin trail, gentlemen, it is a very wide one. Who found the evidence? Who set him up? Lou, Bill, Susie, I want you to go back and check all the sightings of Oswald in Dallas, New Orleans and Mexico in
Can you get some sworn statements?
That's gonna be tough. Nobody's talking.
That's gonna be tough. Nobody's talking.
I think we should have him in for a little talk.
That's fine, Numa, but what about all the people who aren't writing letters. They're sitting home reading all these lies. I just heard NBC crew's in town to do a "White Paper" - not on the Kennedy killing, but on us. One of their top guys, Harry Stoner, is talking to everybody he can find about you, boss...
Oh Jesus, Stoner!... Why doesn't he call me?
Those bastards! That's proof enough right there of what we're up against. The whole goddamn Federal Government, Bill!
Well, they offered you the carrot, and you turned it down... you know what's coming next, don't you, boss?
Found another note, same thing, no name, no signature. "When you receive this, I will be quite dead, so no answer will be possible. I offered you love. All I got in return in the end was a kick in the teeth."
Jesus, they must've been hard pressed to come up with that one.
All right, all right. Break it up.
Where you going, boss?
Where you going, boss?
I don't know, Bill, I just don't know.
I don't buy it, chief - why would the FBI cover it up? You're talking the whole FBI here. A telex that disappears from every single FBI office in the country?
There's a word - orders.
Shaw's our toehold, Bill. I don't know exactly what he is, where he fits, and I don't care. I do know he's lying through his teeth and I'm not gonna let go of him!
So for those reasons, you're going to trial against Clay Shaw, chief? Well, you're gonna lose! We should be investigating all our Mafia leads here in New Orleans - Carlos Marcello, Santos Trafficante - I can buy that a hell of a lot easier than the Government. Ruby's all Mob, knows Oswald, sets him up. Hoffa - Trafficante - Marcello, they hire some guns

I don't doubt their involvement, Bill, but at a low level. Could the Mob change the parade route, Bill, or eliminate the protection for the President? Could the Mob send Oswald to Russia and get him back? Could the Mob get the FBI, the CIA, and the Dallas Police to make a mess of the investigation? Could the Mob appoint the Warren Commission to

Oh, now you're saying Lyndon Johnson was involved? The President of the United States?
I know this, Bill - Lyndon Johnson got $1 billion for his Texas friends, Brown and Root, to dredge Cam Ranh Bay for the military in Vietnam. That's just for openers.

If I'm so far from the truth, why is the FBI bugging our offices? Why are our witnesses being bought off and murdered? Why are Federal agencies blocking our extraditions and subpoenas when we were never blocked before?

Maybe 'cause there's some rogue element in the Government!
With a full-blown conspiracy to cover it up? Y'ever read your Shakespeare, Bill?
Yeah.
Yeah.

This is Louisiana, chief. How the hell do you know who your daddy is? 'Cause your momma told you so... You're way out there taking a crap in the wind, boss, and I for one ain't going along on this one. Jim sighs, saddened. Bill was one of his best men.
What's it look like, Nick?
I don't see any violence, Jim. Heart attack, maybe an aneurysm. Looks like natural causes.
Nick, what would happen if a man suffering from hypertension were to take an entire bottle of Proloid?
He'd die pretty quick, either a heart storm or a ruptured blood vessel in the brain.

Well, it doesn't make sense, Nick - he was afraid of dying, then he kills himself in a way that leaves no trace, but he leaves two unsigned suicide notes.

Mr. Goldberg, you claim you met David Ferrie and Clay Shaw while on a vacation here from your accounting business in New York, you had drinks and, under the influence discussed killing Kennedy, is that not so?
I did.
I did.
Why?

Well, I wanted to make sure she's the same girl I sent.

You know damn well who it is.

Yeah, you got it. Since you're the only straight shooter in that fuckin' office, I'd like an answer from you. Did you plant it?
Yeah, you got it. Since you're the only straight shooter in that fuckin' office, I'd like an answer from you. Did you plant it?
Dave, do you think we're out of our minds? The whole building's been a zoo since that broke. We can't get a thing done. Reporters crawling everywhere. You think we want that?
Somebody planted that fucking story! And somebody tipped off the press I'm one of Garrison's fucking suspects. I can't go home. I'm out on the street. The maggots are everywhere! Do you know what you've done to me? It's all over the national news now. You know what you've done to me?
Calm down, Dave, what?
Calm down, Dave, what?
I'm a dead man! From here on, believe me, I'm a dead man.

I got no place to sleep. I'll meet you in 20 minutes.

I don't know who to trust anymore. Yeah, sure I could use a pot of hot coffee and a few packs of Camels. You got anything new in the investigation?
Dave, I always play square. No bugs. I'd love you to go on the record, but I"m in no hurry. Whenever you're ready.
I don't have much time. They don't even need bugs anymore. They got these fuckin' satellite waves. They put a bug in a friend of mine when he was born, right up his nostrils, subcutaneous, between his eyes. He was one of those products of a crossbreading experiment. A Nazi rocket scientist father and a Commie spy mother. You'd never believe half the shit

Photographs - compromising stuff. And he'll use 'em. The Agency plays for keeps... I knew Oswald. He was in my Civil Air Patrol unit. I taught him everything. A "wanna be," y'know, nobody really liked him cause he was a snitch. I treated him good. He'd talk about his kid, y'know, really wanted her to grow up with a chance, but... He got a
What about the mob, Dave? How do they figure in this?
They're Agency, too. Don't you get it? CIA and Mafia together. Trying to whack out the Beard. Mutual interests. They been doing it for years. There's more to this than you dream. FBI fucking hates the CIA. Navy Intelligence got something to do with it too. Check out "Alan Pope" in Miami. Jack Youngblood. Bill Harvey. Colonel Roselli. The shooter, I hear, was a
Come in, Dave. Have a seat, make yourself comfortable. Coffee?
Do you remember me, Mr. Garrison? I met you on Carondolet Street right after your election. I congratulated you, remember?

How could I forget? You make quite a first impression. Sharon, could you please bring us some coffee? I've heard over the years you're quite a first-rate pilot, Dave. Legend has it you can get in and out of any field, no matter how small... I'm a bit of a pilot myself, you know. Flew grasshoppers for the field artillery in the war.
Do you mind if I smoke, Mr. Garrison?
How could I? Dave, as you know, President Kennedy was assassinated on Friday. A man named Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested as a suspect and then was murdered yesterday by a man named Jack Ruby. We've heard reports that Oswald spent the summer in New Orleans and we've been advised you knew Oswald pretty well.

Well that must've been mistaken information we got. Thanks for straightening it out for us. There is one other matter that's come up, Dave. We were told you took a trip to Texas shortly after the assassination of Friday.

Your young friends also told us you had no weapons in the car. Dave, isn't it a bit difficult to hunt for geese without a shotgun?

Yes, now I remember, Mr. Garrison. I'm sorry, I got confused. We got out there near the geese and it was only then we realized we'd forgotten our shotguns. Stupid, right? So of course we didn't get any geese.

Why? What's wrong?
Why? What's wrong?
Dave, I find your story simply not believable.
Leon's in a bad mood, don't get excited, he's all right.
Would you say this "Leon" was actually Lee Harvey Oswald?
You mean about the Cubans getting trained north of the lake?
Oh, you got that? Banister's pet project. Getting paid by the government to work against the government. Beautiful. What a mind he had, what a guy, Guy. He had all those files.

I don't know. Were you? Who you scared of, Dave?
I don't know. Were you? Who you scared of, Dave?
Everybody! The Agency. The Mob. The Cubans. Yeah, follow the Cubans. Check them out. Here, in Dallas, Miami. Check out a guy named Eladio del Valle. My paymaster when I flew missions into Cuba - he's somewhere in Miami. You're on the right track.
Let me get this straight, now. Clay Shaw is blackmailing you?
Fuckin' A. How do you think the Agency gets people to do their bullshit? Fuck knows what they got on Oswald!
Was it the same Oswald, Dave, that was in Dallas, or was it an impersonator.
Same one. I didn't know no impersonator.
Did you take a good look at the TV when they had Oswald?
Black, black - just give it to me. Shit. I'm so exhausted. My neck is killing me. I've got cancer. Had it for years. I been working with mice, y'know, trying to come up with a cure.

What about Ruby?
What about Ruby?
Jack? Jack was a pimp. A bagman in Dallas for the Mob. He used to run guns to Castro when he was still on our side. Check out Jack Youngblood. Shit - we almost had Castro. Then we tried to whack him. Everybody's flipping sides all the time. It's fun 'n' games, man fun 'n' games.
Then who killed the President?
Oh man, why don't you stop. This is too fuckin' big for you! Who did Kennedy? It's a mystery wrapped in a riddle inside an enigma. Even the shooters don't fuckin' know! Don't you get it yet? I can't be talking like this. They're gonna kill me. I'm gonna die! I don't know what happened. All I wanted in the world was to be
Shit! Forgot to glue this fuckin' rug today. You know, at one time I even had a full head of hair like everyone else. And then I lost that. That fuckin' Clay Shaw. I hate the bastard. All I got left is in his rotten, bloody hands. He tipped the newspapers - I know it. That's how the Agency works. They use people, chew
Dave, it's going to be okay. Just talk to us on the record and we'll protect you. I guarantee it.
They'll get to you, too - they'll destroy you... They're untouchable, man... I'm so fucking exhausted I can't see straight.
Get some rest, Dave, and you'll feel better in the morning. We'll talk then.
Get some rest, Dave, and you'll feel better in the morning. We'll talk then.
Yeah, yeah. But leave me alone for awhile. I got to make some calls.
Colonel Finck, are you saying someone told you not to dissect the neck?

Your Honor, I would ask you to direct the witness to answer my question. Why did Colonel Finck not dissect the track of the bullet wound in the neck?
Well I heard Dr. Humes stating that - he said...
I don't remember his name. You must understand it was quite crowded, and when you are called in circumstances like that to look at the wound of the President who is dead, you don't look around too much to ask people for their names and who they are.
But you were a qualified pathologist. Was this Army general a qualified pathologist?

Oh yes, there were admirals - and when you are a lieutenant colonel in the Army you just follow orders, and at the end of the autopsy we were specifically told - as I recall it was Admiral Kenney, the Surgeon General of the Navy - we were specifically told not to discuss the case.
I'm going to have to ask the jury to leave the courtroom.
What?
Jesus, Ed, from time immemorial it's been standard booking procedure to ask an alias. You know that. There's no constitutional requirement that says a lawyer has to be present for routine questions.
I call'em as I see'em, Jim. I'm ruling it inadmissible.

Daddy said it was all right if I was real quiet.
Sure it is. Freckle Face, if I ever handled a minor felon like that, it'd be all over the papers. I'd catch hell. And this is the alleged murderer of the President?
Dad, look what I drew.
That's something, Jasper. What is it?
That's something, Jasper. What is it?
A rhinoceros. Can I stay up another hour?
Daddy! Where have you been?
Hi, Freckle Face.
Are we going away, Daddy?
Well, it looks like it, Jasper.
Well, it looks like it, Jasper.
Because of Kennedy? Are the same people gonna kill us, Daddy?
Because of Kennedy? Are the same people gonna kill us, Daddy?
No, Jasper, nobody's gonna kill us.
I'm scared.
There's nothing wrong with feeling a little scared, Jasper, Virginia. Telling the truth can be a scary thing. It scared President Kennedy, but he was a brave man. If you let yourself be too scared, then you let the bad guys take over the country, don't you - and then everybody gets scared.
He asked me why I thought I was in danger and I said:
Well if they can kill the President, they can certainly get me.
Well if they can kill the President, they can certainly get me.
That doesn't make sense, Mrs. Hill. We have the man that killed the President.

I knew something was crooked as a dog's hind leg, 'cause no one who is just taking a deposition gets that involved and angry... sure enough, when I finally read my testimony as published by the Warren Commission, it was a fabrication from start to finish.
These new people never identified themselves. They musta been watching the whole thing 'cause they knew everything Mary and me had been doing that day. I guess I wasn't too hard to find - wearing that red raincoat.
How many shots you say you heard?
How many shots you say you heard?
Four to six.

I was scared. It was all kinda queer, but it sure felt like two and two was coming up three... and then they took Mary's five snapshots from me, sent them to Washington, and when they returned them weeks later, two of them had the backgrounds mutilated... The only one we saved was in Mary's camera. I didn't want to go to Washington when
If we go to him our investigation'll hit the front pages by sunrise. Blow up right in our face. Ruby was just given a new trial. If he has something to say, it'll be there. Susie, what did you find out on Oswald?
Negative on his tax records. Classified. First time I know a D.A. can't get a tax record. I put together a list of all the CIA files on Oswald that were part of the Warren Report and asked for them. There are about 1200 documents... Oswald in the USSR, in Mexico City, Oswald and the U2, a CIA 201 personnel file, a memo from
Finally they shuttle him to a radio factory in Minks where he lives as high on the hog as he ever has - he's given 5,000 rubles, a roomy apartment with a balcony, has affairs with local girls.
Makes sense - he's a spokesman.
Makes sense - he's a spokesman.
But he never writes, speaks, or does any propaganda for the Russians. He meets Marina, whose uncle is a colonel in Soviet intelligence, at a trade union dance; she thinks he's Russian the way he speaks, six weeks later they marry, have a daughter.
Don't get sidetracked! How does he get back to the States? That's the point. Does he have any problems?
None! The State Department issues him a new passport in 48 hours and loans him the money to travel. He's never investigated or charged by the Navy for revealing classified information or, as far as we know, debriefed by the CIA.

But who meets him when he gets off the boat in New York in June '62?
Spas T. Raikin, a leading member of an anti-Communist group.
And Marina? Does she have a problem getting out?
And Marina? Does she have a problem getting out?
None either. It's bizarre. It's next to impossible to get Russian sweethearts out. Nor does Lee have any problem getting a new passport when he wants to go to Cuba and Russia in '63. A man who has defected once already. It's crazy.

Dammit, it doesn't add up! Ordinary people get blacklisted for leftist affiliations! The State Department did everything short of dispatching a destroyer to Minks to insure Oswald's return. Only intelligence people can come and go like that.
The next thing we know he's living in Dallas/Ft. Worth in October '62 working 6 months at Jaggars-Chiles- Stovall, a photographic firm that contracts to make maps for the U.S. Army... He starts work only days before the government reveals Russian missiles in Cuba and the crisis explodes. Oswald may have had access to missile site footage obtained by the U2 planes and works
Sort of like Benedict Arnold coming back to George Washington's cabinet.
Sort of like Benedict Arnold coming back to George Washington's cabinet.
Equally incongruous is Oswald becoming chummy with the White Russian community of Dallas - all rabid anti- Communists.
The Oswalds are introduced by George de Mohrenschildt to Janet and Bill Williams. It's through Janet Williams in October '63 that Lee gets the warehouse job, right smack on Elm Street at the Book Depository, which is owned by another oilman with ties to defense and military intelligence.
Presumably so he can now exercise his intellect stacking school texts at $1.25 an hour.
All I can find out about the Williams' is their tax returns are classified and that Bill Williams, a descendant of the Cabots of Massachusetts, has links through his family and United Fruit to the CIA and does classified work for Bell Helicopter which requires a security clearance - so what is Oswald, a defector, doing visiting his wife in his house? Williams has
I wonder about the Williams'. Just where did the first description of Oswald come from at 12:44? No one knows. They claimed it was Brennan's, but his description came after 1 P.M. Who called? Somehow the FBI's been tapping the Williams' and picks up a call between Bell Helicopter and Janet's phone, an unidentified voice saying "We both know who's responsible." Who called? Why's
...now it gets positively spooky. In January, 1961 - in New Orleans, at the Bolton Ford Dealership - when the Oswald we know is in Russia - there is a man using the name "Oswald" to buy trucks for the Friends of Democratic Cuba. The salesman never saw him again, but guess who's on the articles of incorporation of the Friends of Democratic Cuba?
Goddamn! They put Oswald together from Day One! Like some dummy corporation in the Bahamas - you just move him around a board. Sent him to Russia, in and out, no passport problems. You got the word "microdots" in his notebook, you got the Minox camera and the electronic devices they find in his possessions, the sealed DIZ201 personnel file. For all we know,
I don't believe it!
Bugging the District Attorney's office of New Orleans! It's outrageous!
I think Clinton is a breakthrough. Shaw denies he knows Ferrie or Oswald. Is that right? It proves he's a liar. Keep on it, Bill.
This is interesting - are you ready for this? Oswald went to see the FBI two weeks before the assassination. It seems Special Agent Hosty made three routine visits to his house, supposedly to keep an eye on Marina Oswald.
Aren't you being a little hard?
No, I don't think I am, Susie. Anyone else?
I'm sorry.
I know.
I'm not sure I understand.
Well... in an investigation we're conducting your name has come up a number of times.

We recently talked to a number of men who claim to know you. Are you acquainted with a David Logan?

No. Never heard of him.

No.

A Willie O'Keefe?
A Willie O'Keefe?
No, I don't believe I know anyone by that name.
No, I don't believe I know anyone by that name.
Mr. O'Keefe told us he met you at the Masquerade Bar down in the Quarter and several evenings later you had him over for dinner at your apartment on Dauphine Street. Do you recall that?
Perhaps a few more details about the evening will refresh your memory. Mr. O'Keefe told us dinner was served by a uniformed waiter - a colored man. He particularly remembers that you sat at one end and he at the other - which he found rather unusual because the table was so long. Does that bring back memories of Willie O'Keefe?
Not at all. But on the other hand, I do have a lovely Chippendale dining table and I often have a friend over sitting at one end while I sit at the other. That is precisely the point of a long dining table. The splendor of the meal adds to the enjoyment of it.

It adds a taste of elegance for which I must confess a weakness for now and then. I call him Smedley. His real name is Frankie Jenkins - but I could hardly imagine anything more uncouth during dinner than my turning toward the kitchen and hollering "Frankie!" .. Where is this leading to, Mr. Garrison?
After dinner you paid him to have sex with you.
Pffft! Absolute nonsense. The Quarter is filled with vivid imaginations, my dear Mr. Garrison - grimy young hoodlums who'll say and do anything. As you well know.

...in the course of that night, Mr. O'Keefe said a man named David Ferrie stopped by the house... along with another young man...
Who?
David Ferrie.
David Ferrie.
No. I have never known anyone by that name. Of course never having met Mr. O'Keefe I could hardly have met Mr. Ferrie...

No, it was not. Do you know an attorney by the name of Dean Andrews?

One meets so many attorneys in my business. No, I don't believe I know Dean Andrews.
Mr. Shaw, can you identify this man?
Naturally. Are you claiming, Mr. Garrison, that Mr. Oswald also had dinner with me?

Please answer the question.
Please answer the question.
Of course not! Such a pity, that assassination. In fact, I admired President Kennedy. A man with true panache, and a wife with impeccable taste.
Mr. Shaw, this is an Italian newspaper article saying you were a member of the Board of Centro Mondo Commerciale in Italy, that this company was a creature of the CIA for the transfer of funds in Italy for illegal political-espionage activities. It says that this company was expelled from Italy for those activities.
I'm well aware of this asinine article. And I am thinking very seriously of suing this rag of a newspaper.

Mr. Garrison, you're reaching. I am an international businessman. The Trade Mart which I founded is America's commercial pipeline to Latin America. I trade everywhere. I am accused, as are all businessmen, of all things. I somehow go about my business, make money, help society the best I can and try to promote free trade in this world.

Mr. Shaw, have you ever been a contract agent with the Central Intelligence Agency?
And if I was, Mr. Garrison... do you think I would be here today... talking to somebody like you?
No, people like you don't have to, I guess - people like you walk between the raindrops.

Now just a minute, sir! You're way out of line!
In the sheriff's report, Mrs. Mercer, it says you were at Dealey Plaza two hours before the assassination but that...
Yes, it was about 11 in the morning. I was driving west on Elm Street toward the Triple Underpass, in a rented car - a blue Valiant. I'll never forget that day.
You mean you identified him on Saturday, the day before Ruby shot Oswald?
That's right. When I saw him on TV, I was shocked. I said to my family, "that was the man I saw in the truck."

That's what bothers me, Mr. Garrison. You see, they've been altered. My statements...
This says "Mercer could not identify any of the photographs as being identical with the person she had observed slouched over the wheel of a green Ford pickup truck." That's not true. I recognized him and I told them so... They also said it was a dark green air conditioning truck, which it was not. And here... ...on the Dallas Sheriff's report. This is

I know, but Mr. Garrison, the FBI is just not doing their job.
Jim, dinner's just about ready... I've got a surprise for you... tried something new... Jim? Jim, dinner.
Mmmmm... sure smells good... but Egghead, do you realize Oswald was interrogated for twelve hours after the assassination, with no lawyer present, and nobody recorded a word of it? I can't believe it. A police captain with 30 years experience and a crowd of Federal agents just had to know that with no record anything that Oswald said would be inadmissible in court.

Come on now, we'll talk about it at the table, dinner's getting cold. What are you doing in here?
I can't believe a man as intelligent as Earl Warren ever read what's in those volumes.
Well maybe you're right, Jim. I'll give you one hour to solve the case... until the kids are in bed. Then you're mine and Mr. Kennedy can wait 'til morning. Come on, everybody say goodnight to Daddy.
One hour, y'hear? Some Saturday night date you are. Mama warned me this would happen if I married such a serious man.
Oh, she did, huh? When I come up I'll show you how Saturday night got invented.
Honey, you all right?
It's incredible, honey - the whole thing. A Lieutenant Colonel testifies that Lee Oswald was given a Russian language exam as part of his Marine training only a few months before he defects to the Soviet Union. A Russian exam!

Honey, in all my years in the service I never knew a single man who was given a Russian test. Oswald was a radar operator. He'd have about as much use for Russian as a cat has for pajamas.

These books are getting to your mind, Mr. Garrison. I wish you'd stop readin' them.

And then this Colonel tries to make it sound like nothing. Oswald did badly on the test, he says. "He only had two more Russian words right than wrong." Ha! That's like me saying Touchdown here... ...is not very intelligent because I beat him three games out of five the last time we played chess.

Liz, do I have to spell it out for you? Lee Oswald was no ordinary soldier. That was no accident he was in Russia. He was probably in military intelligence. That's why he was trained in Russian.

Goddammit! I been sleeping for three years!
Do you have any evidence against him, Jim? Clay Shaw's done so much for the city with all that restoration in the Quarter. He's well connected, all his friends, the money, people, be careful, Jim.
It'll be off the record, honey. I'll bring him in on a Sunday. A quiet little chat between gentlemen.
Jim, come on, honey, get down on your hands and knees and hunt for Jasper's Easter egg.
You know I don't like these tribal rituals, Freckle Face. I'm interviewing Clay Shaw this morning.
No. I told you I was going to talk to Shaw.
But why in the Lord's name would you do it in the middle of Easter Sunday when you knew we were...

It's not funny, Jim, I'm scared.

Don't be. Nothing to be scared about, honey, I been through four years of war - this is nothing.
Nothing is going to happen to you. I won't let it.
Leave us ALONE for God's sake! ...Oh, it's Lou.
Did you enter Virginia into a beauty contest?
What?
What?

Honey, come on. The government wants you to be scared. They want everybody to be scared to speak out. They count on it. But there's nothing to be scared of.
You and your government! What's the matter with you? Don't you have any feelings? Your daughter! What kind of man are you?
I'll take them up to my mother's if it'll make you feel better. Spend a week. I'll change the locks, the phone lines, I'll even get a bodyguard, all right? Elizabeth, get a hold of yourself.
Jim, before this Kennedy thing, nothing mattered to you in this life more than your children. The other night Jasper tried to show you a drawing. You didn't even notice he was there. He came to me bawling his little eyes out. Jim, he's sensitive - he needs more from you.

Of course, I've changed! My eyes have opened, and once they're open, believe me, what used to look normal seems insane! And now King. Don't you think this has something to do with that? Can't you see?

I don't want to see, goddammit! I'm tired. I've had enough! They say you don't have anything anyway! Everybody in town's talking. You're ruining this man Shaw's life! You're attacking him because he's homosexual! Going ahead with this stupid "trial"! Did you ever once stop and consider what he's going through?

Oh, I don't know anymore! I believe there was a conspiracy, but not the government. I just want to raise our children and live a normal life! I want my life back!
Well so do I, goddammit! So do I! I had a life too, y'know - I had a life, too. But you just can't bury your head in the sand like some ostrich, goddammit, Elizabeth! It's not just about you - and your well- being and your two cars and your kitchen and your TV and "I'm jes fine honey." While our kids grow
You never talked to me this way before, Jim Garrison. I'm not making any threats. I'm leaving you. I'm taking the kids to my mother's. I am - I am.
And if you're wrong?
I never doubted for a second that I was. Will you come to the trial, Elizabeth?
I never doubted for a second that I was. Will you come to the trial, Elizabeth?
I don't think so, Jim...
They killed him, honey.
Huh?

He won... and they killed Robert Kennedy. They shot him down.
He won... and they killed Robert Kennedy. They shot him down.
Oh no! No! I can't believe it. I can't believe it. Both of them, both brothers, oh my God!
I want to thank you, Mr. O'Keefe, for this time.
Call me Willie. I ain't got nuthin' but time, Mr. Garrison. Minutes, hours, days, years of'em. Time just stands still here like a snake sunnin' itself in the road...
For sexual purposes?
Well... yeah.
Anything else unusual about him you'd be able to describe in a court of law, Willie?
I remember he had some kinda thing wrong with his left leg. He limped. Don't get me wrong, he's not one of those, you know, limp wrists. He's a butch John. You'd meet him on the street, you'd never snap. You could go fishing with him, play poker with him, you'd never snap in a million years. So one night we were over at
Willie, are you willing to repeat your statements under sodium pentothal? Under the supervision of a doctor?
Fuck, yeah! I told you so. And you can tell'em all I told you so.

Bring on all the motherfuckers! Bring their college degrees in here! I got nuthin' to hide. They can't buy me. You can't buy me. I don't even need the parole. This is about the truth coming out.

No one's trying to buy you, Willie. It's important to know why you're telling us this.
You wanna know why? 'Cause that mother fucker Kennedy stole that fuckin' election, that's why! Nixon was gonna be one of the great Presidents 'til Kennedy wrecked this fuckin' country. Got niggers all over the fuckin' place asking for their rights, where do you think we got all this fuckin' crime now, 'cause Kennedy promised 'em too damned much. Revolution comin'. Fascism's coming back.
What's wrong, Lou?
Boss, the President's been shot. In Dallas. Five minutes ago.
Oh no!... How bad?
No word yet. But they think it's in the head.
One little guy with a cheap rifle - look what he can do.
Let's get outta here, Lou. I saw too much stuff like this in the war.
I know David - a strange character.
He's been in trouble before. Used to be a hot shot pilot for Eastern Airlines, but he got canned after an alleged homosexual incident with a 14-year old boy.
Remember whose office this was back in '63? 531 Lafayette Street.
Yeah, Guy Banister. Ex-FBI man. He died couple years ago.
I'd say he was probably getting intelligence training.
Lou, you were in the Marines. Who would be running that training?
Lou, you were in the Marines. Who would be running that training?
The Office of Naval Intelligence.
The Office of Naval Intelligence.
Take a look across the street.
Post Office.
Upstairs. In 1963 that was the Office of Naval Intelligence - And just by coincidence, Banister, before he was FBI, was ONI. What do they say?
Upstairs. In 1963 that was the Office of Naval Intelligence - And just by coincidence, Banister, before he was FBI, was ONI. What do they say?
"Once ONI, always ONI"?
Bill, Lou, we're standing in the heart of the United States Government's intelligence community in New Orleans. That's the FBI there, the CIA, Secret Service, ONI. Doesn't this seem to you a rather strange place for a Communist to spend his spare time?
What are you driving at, boss?
What are you driving at, boss?
We're going back into the case, Lou - the murder of the President. I want you to take some money from the Fees and Fines Account and go to Dallas - talk to some people. Bill, I want you to get Oser on the medical, the autopsy, Susan on Oswald and Ruby histories, tax records...
They took 'em to the Sheriff's office, not the police station, and they let 'em go. No record of them ever being questioned.
I can't say that comes as a surprise anymore.
I can't say that comes as a surprise anymore.
A photographer from The Dallas Times Herald got some great shots of them never published...
...take a good look, chief, do any of 'em look like the hoboes you remember?
Hoboes I knew of old used to sleep in their clothes - these two look pretty young.
Hoboes I knew of old used to sleep in their clothes - these two look pretty young.
...not a single frayed collar or cuff, new haircuts, fresh shaves, clean hands - new shoe leather. Look at the ear of the cop... That's a wire. What's a cop wearing a headset for? I think they're actors, chief; they're not cops.
Graveyard dead. August this year. A single car accident on an empty road in Midlothian, Texas. The doctor said he was in some kind of strange shock when he died.
We need to find more witnesses, Lou.
We need to find more witnesses, Lou.
There was Rose Cheramie. A whore. Two Cubans threw her out of a car on the way to Dallas.
Can we find her?
Graveyard dead near Big Sandy, Texas in '65. Two in the morning on some highway. A hit and run.
I never could figure out why this guy orders a traceable weapon to that post office box when you can go into any store in Texas, give a phony name and walk out with a cheap rifle which can never be traced.
Unless he or someone else wants him to get caught. Maybe he never ordered the weapon, Lou. Somebody else did. It was picked up at the post office early morning when Oswald's time sheet shows him clocked in at his job. Lou, come alive. These things are not adding up.
Mobbed up all the way. Tight with the Dallas cops. I'm digging, chief. I just need 10 more men and some more dollars.
I know you do, Lou. I'm doing three more lectures this month. You're all doing an incredible job, Sue, Al, Numa. But this is one where if you don't nail the other guy, you're dead. How did Jack Ruby dies so quick? Of what? Cancer, right? A history of Nazi Germany, Lou. They were studying viral cancers as a weapon in the 30's. We
Goddamn Sam!
And it ain't pretty ..."the AD has spent more than $8,000 on unexplained travel and investigative expenses since November, 1966.
You don't get it, guys - he can't go down any further. We got to protect him full time.
I have a plane to catch... going to Washington. An interesting lead, says he's closely connected to these events, but he won't come down here... I know what you're going through with Ferrie, Lou. We'll talk tomorrow.

I'm onto Ferrie's Cuban paymaster, Eladio del Valle, in Miami. I gotta get him in, boss. I need more men - I can't even pull the teams to watch Ferrie... This is our case!
I took it once for a low thyroid condition... It raises the metabolism, Lou. Did David Ferrie strike you as the kind of person who had a low metabolism?
I'd say the opposite - hypertension.
Time?
Between six and seven seconds.
Between six and seven seconds.
The key is the second and third shots came right on top of each other, and it takes a minimum 2.3 seconds to recycle this thing. The other problem is there was a tree right there... Blocking the first two shots at the time they occur in the Zapruder film.

It was a Texas Live Oak, boss. It sheds it's leaves the first week of March. You try to hit a moving target at 88 yards through heavy foliage with this cheap 13-dollar sucker, the world's worst shoulder weapon. No way. The FBI tried two sets of tests and not one of their sharpshooters could match Oswald's performance. Not one. And Oswald was at

Why not just shoot Kennedy coming up Houston? There's plenty of time - he's out in the open - a frontal shot?
When Kennedy gets to the kill zone, it's a turkey shoot.
How many men?
How many men?
One shooter. One spotter on a radio. Maybe three teams. I'd say these were professional riflemen, chief, serious people. Hunters... patient. It takes skill to kill with a rifle, that's why there's been no execution of an executive with one in 200 years... "3-2-1... green!" Or else "Abort! Abort!"
Who do you think changed the parade route?
Beats me. City officials. Secret Service. Dallas police. They did a dry run with Chief Curry a few days before. But they didn't bother running through Dealey. They stopped right there, said something like, "and afterwards there's only the freeway," and went home.

No.

Earle Cabell. And guess who his brother is?
Earle Cabell. And guess who his brother is?
Who?
Who?
General Charles Cabell. Deputy Director of the CIA. Fired by Kennedy in '61 because of the Bay of Pigs fiasco, he moved back to the Pentagon, called Kennedy a "traitor". When he came to New Orleans to address the Foreign Policy Association, you know who introduced him? Our friend Clay Shaw.

Head of the CIA since '53. Kennedy fired them both. Cabell was his deputy for nine years. Talk about the fox investigating the chicken coop. Now we'll have to subpoena them, Lou.

They're gonna love you, chief.
Maybe we should just call it a day, Lou. Go home. While we're still a little behind. We got two people killed, maybe more we never thought about.
You never got anyone killed, boss. Their actions killed them years before. If we stopped now, it'd be even more wrong.
Chief, I've had my doubts about Bill for a long time. He's fighting everything.
We need him back.
I just plain don't trust him anymore.
Maybe you didn't hear what I said. I will not tolerate this infighting among the staff, I warn you that...
Maybe you didn't hear what I said. I will not tolerate this infighting among the staff, I warn you that...
Boss, then I'm afraid I can't continue working with Bill.
Are you giving me an ultimatum, Lou?
Well, if that's what you want to call it. I didn't ever think it would come to this. I guess I am, boss.
Well, if that's what you want to call it. I didn't ever think it would come to this. I guess I am, boss.
I will not have any damned ultimatums put to me, Lou. I'll accept your resignation.

You sure got it. You're one stubborn and stupid sonofabitch D.A. and you're making one hell of a mistake!
Sad thing is the way it's screwing up this country, all these hippies running around on drugs, the way young people look you can't tell a boy from a girl anymore. I saw a girl the other day, she was pregnant - you could see her whole belly, and you know what she painted on it? "Love Child." It's fuckin' outa control. Values've gone

Don't get me started on that. Those Warren Commission fellows were pickin' gnat shit out of pepper. No one's gonna tell me that kid did the shooting job he did from that damned bookstore.
I thought the FBI test-fired the rifle to make sure it could be done?
Sure, three experts and not one of them could do it! They're telling us Oswald got off three shots with world-class precision from a manual bolt action rifle in less than six seconds - and accordin' to his Marine buddies he got Maggie's drawers - he wasn't any good. Average man would be lucky to get two shots off, and I tell ya the

If I were investigatin', I'd round up the 100 best riflemen in the world and find out which ones were in Dallas that day. You been duck hunting? I think Oswald was a good old-fashioned decoy. What'd he say? "I'm just a patsy." Out of the mouth of babes y'ask me.

You think there were other men involved, Russell?
Hell, you're the District Attorney. You read the Warren Report - and then you tell me you're satisfied Lee Oswald shot the President all by his lonesome.
Russell, honestly you sound like one of those kooky critics spreading paranoia like prairie fire. I just can't believe the Chief Justice of the United States would put his name on something that wasn't true.

Honey, another one of these. This one's as weak as cricket pee-pee. Yessir, you mark my words, Jim, Vietnam's gonna cost Johnson '68 and it's gonna put that other varmint Nixon in - then watch your hide, 'cause there ain't no offramps on a freeway to Hell!
Welcome, District Attorney Garrison. May I call you Jim?
I've been called everything under the sun, Jerry. Call me whatever you like.
There have been a number of reports in reputable news media - Time, Newsweek, our own NBC - that you have gone way beyond the legal means available to a prosecutor, that you've intimidated and drugged witnesses, bribed them, urged them to commit perjury. What is your response?
Your faith in the veracity of the major media is touching, Jerry. It indicates that the Age of Innocence is not yet over. But seriously, Jerry, people aren't interested in Jim Garrison - they want the hard evidence! They want to know why he was killed and what forces were opposed to...

Are they? Why would they?
Are they? Why would they?
That's exactly my question, Jerry. Maybe I'd better show you some pictures so you can begin to understand what I am talking about.
Pictures like this don't show up on television!
Sure they do. The camera can pick this up.
Sure they do. The camera can pick this up.
No, it can't!
Jim Garrison?
Yes.
Yes.
I'm glad you came. I'm sorry about the precautions.
I'm glad you came. I'm sorry about the precautions.
Well, I just hope it was worth my while, Mr...
I could give you a false name, but I won't. Just call me X.
I've already been warned by the Agency, Mr. Whoever. If this is another type of threat, I don't...
I've already been warned by the Agency, Mr. Whoever. If this is another type of threat, I don't...
I'm not with the Agency, Mr. Garrison, and I assume if you've come this far, what I have to say interests you. But I'm not going to name names, or tell you who or what I represent. Except to say - you're close, you're closer than you think...
I don't... I can't believe it. They killed him because he wanted to change things. In our time - in our country?
Kings are killed, Mr. Garrison. Politics is power, nothing more. But don't believe me. Don't trust me. Do your own work, your own thinking.

No chance in hell, Mr. Garrison. I'd be arrested and gagged, declared insane and hospitalized... maybe worse. You, too. I can only give you background, you got to find the foreground, the little things... Keep digging. Y'know you're the only person to ever bring a trial in the murder of John Kennedy. That's important - it's historic.

But you don't have a choice anymore. You've become a significant threat to the national security structure. They would've killed you already, but you got a lot of light on you. Instead, they're gonna destroy your credibility; they already have in many circles in this town. You're some kinda ego-crazed southern caricature to many folks. Be honest - the best chance you got is
Well, thanks for coming.
You didn't get that break you needed, but you went as far as any man could, bubba. What can I do for you?
You didn't get that break you needed, but you went as far as any man could, bubba. What can I do for you?
Just speculating, I guess. How do you think it started?
Just speculating, I guess. How do you think it started?
I think it started in the wind. Money - arms, big oil, Pentagon people, contractors, bankers, politicians like L.B.J. were committed to a war in Southeast Asia. As early as '61 they knew Kennedy was going to change things... He was not going to war in Southeast Asia. Who knows? Probably some boardroom or lunchroom somewhere - Houston, New York - hell, maybe Bonn,
He's done it before. Other countries. Lumumba in the Congo, Trujillo, the Dominican Republic, he's working on Castro. No big deal. In September, Kennedy announces the Texas trip. At that moment, second Oswalds start popping up all over Dallas where they have the mayor and the cops in their pocket. Y flies in the assassins, maybe from the special camp we keep outside Athens,
Any chance of one of them confessing someday?

Ever ask him?
Ever ask him?
You never ask a spook a question. No point. He'll never give you a straight answer. General Y still thinks of himself of the handsome young warrior who loved this country but loved the concept of war more.

Does it matter? Another technician. But an interesting thing - he was there that day in Dealey Plaza. You know how I know? That picture of yours. The hoboes... you never looked deep enough...
I knew the man 20 years. That's him. The way he walked... arms at his side, military, the stoop, the haircut, the twisted left hand, the large class ring. What was he doing there? If anyone had asked him, he'd probably say "protection" but I'll tell you I think he was giving some kind of "okay" signal to those hoboes - they're about to

I keep thinking of that day, Tuesday the 26th, the day after they buried Kennedy, L.B.J. was signing the memorandum on Vietnam with Ambassador Lodge.
Here's my problem, Jack. You told me you and Guy were good friends for a long time?
More than ten years.
More than ten years.
And he never hit you before?
And he never hit you before?
Never touched me.
Never touched me.
Yet on November 22, 1963 - the day of the President's murder - our police report says he pistol-whipped you with a .357 Magnum. But the police report says you had an argument over the phone bill. Here, take a look at it. Now, does a simple argument over phone bills sound like a believable explanation to you?
How much more?
I don't know if I should talk about this.
I don't know if I should talk about this.
Well, I'd ask Guy - we were friendly, you know - heart attack, wasn't it?

Why did Guy beat you, Jack?
Why did Guy beat you, Jack?
Well, I guess now that Guy's dead, it don't really matter... it was about the people hanging around the office that summer. I wasn't really part of the operation, you know. I was handling the private-eye work for Guy when that came in - not much did - but that's why I was there... it was a nuthouse. There were all these Cubans coming
Dave Ferrie - you know about him?
Was he there often?
Was he there often?
Often? He practically lived there. It was real cloak and dagger stuff. They called it Operation Mongoose. The idea was to train all these Cuban exiles for another invasion of Cuba. Banister's office was part of a supply line that ran from Dallas, through New Orleans to Miami, stockpiling arms and explosives.
Where is Banister in all this?
Banister was running his camp north of Lake Pontchartrain. Ferrie handled a lot of the training. There was a shooting range and a lot of tropical terrain like in Cuba. A few Americans got trained, too. Nazi types. Mercenaries. But Ferrie was the craziest.
Like I said, a fuckin' nuthouse.
And Oswald?
Yeah, he was there, too... sometimes he'd be meeting with Banister with the door shut. Other times he'd be shooting the bull with Ferrie. But he was there all right.
Anything more specific, Jack? It's important.
Anyone else involved at Banister's level?
There was one guy, I don't know, big guy, business guy, white hair - I saw him come into the office once. He looked out of place, y'know - like a society guy. Can't remember his name. Oswald was with him.
Clay something, that was his name - Clay.
Bertrand. Clay Bertrand?
Bertrand. Clay Bertrand?
Yeah! That's it. I don't know. Maybe it wasn't. I gotta go.
Yeah! That's it. I don't know. Maybe it wasn't. I gotta go.
Clay Bertrand. He's in the Warren Report. He tried to get Oswald a lawyer. Was Kennedy ever discussed, Jack?

Hold on, Jack. What's the problem?

Nobody knows what we're talking about, Jack.

You're so naive, mister.
Didn't someone say he didn't speak good Russian?
It's a contradiction, Numa, get used to them. The only explanation for the royal treatment is he did give them radar secrets. Or fake secrets.
Even my own wife, chief, Who's wondering where I am?
Even your own wife, Numa. Any of you want to quit, do me a favor... put us out of our misery.
HOLD IT, CHIEF...
You just need some sleep, Lou. It won't look so bad when...
Well, believe what you want, boss, but we got to be more careful. All these new volunteers, any one of them could be...
Okay, you handle it, Numa. I don't have time for this nonsense. We've obviously got the bastards worried now. I'm going to Washington.
No, she could get hurt. If you believe what's happening to these other people.
She's the best damn witness we have!
She's the best damn witness we have!
I just don't want to do it. What else?
Hate mail here. Fan mail here. The bad news is the IRS has just requested an audit on your income from this office.
I expected that two months ago, and they're wasting their time... The bad news is the National Guard has just asked me to resign after 18 years. Well, maybe that's good news - it was never as good as combat, but this is. Bill, any more on Oswald and Shaw?
Sure sounds like he's winning.
He'll never make it. If he wins, they'll kill him. He wants to avenge his brother. He'll stop that war. No, they'll kill him before they let him become President.
I don't think so, Al. You remember the Hemingway story, "The Old Man and the Sea"? The old fisherman manages to catch this great fish - a fish so huge he has to tie it to the side of the boat to get it back in. But by the time he reached shore, the fish had long since been picked apart by sharks and
Then what are we going through all this trouble for?
Then what are we going through all this trouble for?
It's a means to an end. This war has two fronts - in the court of law, we hope, against the odds, to nail Clay Shaw on a conspiracy charge. In the court of public opinion, it could take another 25 or 30 years for the truth to come out, but at least we're going to strike the first blow.
Welcome, Mr. Miller. Jim Garrison. Would you care for some coffee?
Yes, thank you, Mr. Garrison. Your coffee's almost Turkish down here but I could get used to it.
I'm glad you could find time to see me. I flew down from Denver this morning on my private jet.
Yes, your letter indicated you were in he oil business up there.
Yes, your letter indicated you were in he oil business up there.
I've done quite well in Denver, Mr. Garrison, but I have to admire someone like you - and I have the means to back up what I say.

They've been enlarged and show a lot of detail...
Splendid, love to see them.
Where were you? Europe, Pacific?
Germany.
Germany.
You were lucky. I spent three years in the Pacific. I've never seen an avenue with such a profusion of bail-bonding companies. Why is that?

If you must know, virtually nothing.

That's it.
I'm going to be very frank with you. You've done a great job, an astounding job considering the limited resources available to you. But the best you can ever hope for is to stir up a lot of confusion. You're not going to do this country any good, and you're not going to do yourself any good. You don't belong here. On this Mickey
The job manages to keep me pretty busy.
The job manages to keep me pretty busy.
Nonsense. You should be in a job where you can make decisions that have impact, affect the world. Here you're trying to climb up the steep side of Mount Everest.
I propose you accept an appointment to the bench in Federal District Court and move into a job worthy of your talent. Do you have any idea, do you have any conception of how easily such an appointment can be arranged?
And what would I have to do?
And what would I have to do?
Stop your investigation... it was a magnificent effort but it's over and done with. The press is already on your behind and that's only the beginning, my boy, only the beginning.

And how tall are you?
And you get of from school at 3 every day?
Yes.
Yes.
Do you walk home?
Do you walk home?
Uh huh.
Then do you understand that I cannot tell the truth here? In Dallas. That there are people here who do not want me to tell the truth... who do not want me to have a retrial?
Mr. Ruby, I really can't see why you can't tell us now.
When are you going back to Washington, sir?
I am going back very shortly after we finish this hearing - I am going to have some lunch.
I am going back very shortly after we finish this hearing - I am going to have some lunch.
Can I make a statement? If you request me to go back to Washington with you right now, that is if you want to hear further testimony from me, can you do that? Can you take me with you?

No, that could not be done, Mr. Ruby. There are a good many things involved in that.
No, that could not be done, Mr. Ruby. There are a good many things involved in that.
What are they?
What are they?
Well, the public attention it would attract. And we have no place for you there to be safe, we're not law enforcement officials, and many things are at stake in this affair, Mr. Ruby.
Well, the public attention it would attract. And we have no place for you there to be safe, we're not law enforcement officials, and many things are at stake in this affair, Mr. Ruby.
But if I am eliminated there won't be any way of knowing. Consequently a whole new form of government is going to take over this country, and I know I won't live to see you another time. My life is in danger here. Do I sound screwy?

Well I don't know what can be done, Mr. Ruby, because I don't know what you anticipate we will encounter.
Then you don't stand a chance, Mr. Chief Justice, you have a lost cause. All I want is a lie detector test, and you refuse to give it to me. Because as it stands now - and the truth serum - how do you pronounce it - Pentothal - whatever it is. They will not give it to me, because I want to tell
Can I help you?
Yes, you have a suit I've had my eye on.
This looks pretty good on me.
Are you kidding, it looks great. You wear this to a business meeting, you're the badass in the room. But you can go out dancing in this too. It's a total power suit.
I think I'm gonna just get this for today. I'm in kind of a hurry. Would you mind ringing this up while I change out of it?
Not a problem.
Not a problem.
Thanks.
I'm sorry, I just decided to stay in the suit -- get out of that damn uniform.
Oh, that's not a problem.
Tomorrow I'll talk to your probation officer. Karen's a good kid, but she's mad at you, because you lied to her. This business about your grandmother's funeral
I went. I did. I took my mother and little brother.
I went. I did. I took my mother and little brother.
But you didn't ask permission. You broke a trust. If you had asked, Karen probably would have let you. I'm sure she would.

I know. That's why I went.

But then you told her you were home.
But then you told her you were home.
Sure, 'cause I didn't ask her if I could go.
I don't know. Maybe it's a language problem. Anita, you ever cause this much heartache over something that could easily be avoided, I'll never write you again. You understand?
I understand.
I understand.
I mean it. I don't care how many times your mother calls or how much she cries.
I understand.
Then say "Yes, Max. I understand."
Then say "Yes, Max. I understand."
Yes, Max, I understand.
So you're gonna call Karen tomorrow?
I'll call her.
I'll call her.
Won't forget?
Won't forget?
I won't forget.

Why the fuck you at home? Cause I spent ten thousand dollars gittin' your ass home. Look, I gotta problem. I need help, and you can help me.

I'm gonna sell the other two tonight. This group of Koreans in Koreatown have started a Neighborhood Watch kinda thing. And they want a few weapons so the neighborhood niggas know they mean business. So I'm gonna sell 'em my two machine guns tonight. Only problem, I ain't never dealt with these Koreans before. Now I ain't worried. Asians are by and large real

You think I wanted to spend ten thousand dollars on your ass?
Answer the question, nigga. Do you think I wanted to spend the thousand dollars on your ass? Yes or no?
Course you didn't.
Course you didn't.
But the only way to help you was to do that, so I did it. Okay, how 'bout this? After we're through fuckin' with these Koreans, I take you to Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles. My treat.
Does he have the marked bills on him?
In his inside coat pocket.
Why were you with him?
I went to give him his refund, so he wouldn't have to come here.

I told Jackie, and Jackie said you wanted him.
I'd say there's about, oh, fifty thousand dollars here. What would you say Ray?
That looks like fifty thousand dollars from here.
You got a good lawyer?
Can she afford a good one is the question. Otherwise she'll be in Sybill Brand three weeks easy before the Public Defender gets around to her.

She ain't said it, but she's not stupid, she knows it's you who wants her.
We are. Don't worry about it.
Every step of this goes in my report. I am now taking a manila envelope from the subject's flight bag.
The envelope contains currency... all the same denomination, one-hundred- dollar bills. Now, I'm counting it.
What time do you have to be there?
Can I have a word with you?
Sure.
Hi, I'm Detective Mark Dargus. L.A.P.D. can I ask what you have in that bag?
The usual things. I'm a flight attendant with Cabo Air.
I doubt it. Who's your friend?
This is Special Agent Ray Nicolet with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. Would you mind if we looked in that bag?
Would I mind? Do I have a choice?
You have the right to say "no." And I have the right to make you wait here with Ray while I go get a warrant. And if I don't want to go through all that trouble, I could just take you in on suspicion.

Suspicion of what?
This is your money?
If I were to tell you "no it isn't..."
You should know if you bring in anything over ten thousand you have to declare it. You forgot or what? You could get a two hundred and fifty thousand dollar fine, plus two years in prison. Now you want to talk to us about it, or you want to talk to Customs?
I'm not saying another word.
Hey, this is my office. There's no smoking.
Arrest me.
I'm not a loser.
Oh, you're both? In 1985 you were flying for TWA and got busted for carrying drugs. You were carrying them for a pilot husband of yours. He did time and you got off. But that ended your career with the big airlines. Cut to thirteen years later. You're forty-four years of age. You're flying for the shittiest little shuttle-fucking piece of shit Mexican airline
Help yourself.
While you're at it, let me see what else is in there. You mind?
My pocketbook.
What's in it?
What's in it?
Beauty products.
What's this?
That's my diet shit.
Oh, I wouldn't be so sure. What with all the cash, I think I could go with Conspiracy to Traffic.
I'm tellin' you, I don't know nothin' about that fuckin' shit.
Let me have a word outside with Agent Nicolet for a moment?
Take your time.
Take your time.
Thanks.
Help us do what?
Help you get Ordell Robbie.
But now you're telling us now you do.
'Course I do -- I deliver money for him.
You don't want much, do you?
Can you do it or not?
How was your flight?
Fine.
Fine.

Okay.
Are you really a bail bondsman?
Who do you think I am?
I gave you my card there.
Can I see your I.D.?

You know, I figured out the other day I've written something like fifteen thousand bonds since I've been in the business. I'd say about eighty percent of them were at least drug related. If you want, I can help you look at your options.
You're not tired of it?
I am, as a matter of fact.
What have they told you?
So far I've been told I can cooperate and get probation, maybe. Or, I can stand mute and get as much as five years. Does that sound right?

Shit.
Shit.
But they won't want to take you to trial. They'll offer you simple Possession, a few months of County time, and a year or two probation. How 'bout another?

Sure.
You know who put the dope in your bag?
Yeah, but that's not what this was about. They were fuckin waitin' for my ass. They knew I had that money, they even knew the amount. The one who searched my bag, from L.A.P.D., Dargus, hardly even looked at it. "Oh, I'd say there's fifty thousand here. What would you say?" But all they could do was threaten me and hand me over to

Who gave me the money and who I was giving it to. And some guy they found in a trunk with his head blown off. Said it was him who told them 'bout me.
That would be Beaumont Livingston.

Ray Nicolet with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.
He's the one who wants you.
It was the other guy who busted me.
It was the other guy who busted me.
'Cause if he busted you, you'd play hell bonding out of federal court. He doesn't want you mad at him, he wants you to tell him what you know. He uses you to get a line on Ordell, make a case, then take him federal. You know what Ordell's into?

I have a pretty good idea. Ordell ain't no bootlegger and I doubt he's smugglin' Cuban cigars. So that only leaves one thing an A.T.F. man would be interested in.
I used to bring over ten thousand at a time. That's the legal limit, so I never brought more than that.
How many trips did you make?

That's it. He's cash poor. He kept on me till I finally said okay. I'll bring whatever fits in a nine-by- twelve envelope. I got paid five hundred dollars, and his friend, Mr. Walker, in Mexico gave me the envelope.

If you knew bringing anything over ten thousand was against the law, why not pack a hundred grand?
Whatever it was had to fit in my bag and not hit you in the face if the bag was opened. This ain't solvin' my problem. I gotta figure out a way to either keep my job or get out of trouble. I'm off today, but if I can't leave the country I'm out of a job. And if I don't got a job,
Ask A.T.F. They might give you permission.

Well, Jackie, you got caught, you're gonna have to give 'em something.
Well, Jackie, you got caught, you're gonna have to give 'em something.

But if all I can give 'em is Ordell's name -- I don't really know shit about what he does or how he does it -- That don't give me much to bargain with.
Give 'em what you got. Offer to help. Show a willingness to be helpful. You want to stay out of jail, don't you?
What'dya think?
I think maybe I have more options than I thought.
If you're having some.
I am. Have a seat.
You get a chance to use it?
I felt a lot safer having it. My milk went bad when I was in jail.

Somebody loan it to you?
Yeah.
Want to hear some music?
Sure.
I couldn't wait till I got home last night and wash my hair.
It looks nice.
You never got into the whole CD revolution?
I got a few. But I can't afford to start all over again. I got too much time and money invested in my records.

How do you get it out?
Same way I been doin', but first they got to let me go back to work.

Well, I've flown seven million miles. And I've been waitin' on people almost twenty years. The best job I could get after my bust was Cabo Air, which is about the worst job you can get in this industry. I make about sixteen thousand, with retirement benefits, ain't worth a damn. And now with this arrest hanging over my head, I'm scared. If I

Does it happen to all men?
Well, I'd never be so bold as to speak for all men, but as or myself and a few of my friends, that's definitely the case. There's a lot of actresses out there you like, and there's some you have crushes on. But there's always one who you love. And with her it's sorta like going steady.

Has Nicolet told you any colorful stories like that?
He tries to act cool.
No harm in that. He's a young guy havin' fun being a cop. I know the type, trust me on this. He's more interested in Ordell than the money. If he's gonna do anything suspect, it'll be cutting corners to get the conviction; but he wouldn't walk off with the money. It's evidence.

What about you Max?
What? If I was in Nicolet's place?
What? If I was in Nicolet's place?
No, I mean you, right now. Not it you were somebody else.
No, I mean you, right now. Not it you were somebody else.
If I saw a way to walk off with a shopping bag full of money, would I take it?

You know where it came from. It's not like it's anybody's life savings. It wouldn't even be missed.

You're avoiding the question.
You're avoiding the question.
Okay, sure. I might be tempted. Especially now, since I'm getting out of the bail bonds business.
I have to stand behind all my active bonds, but I'm not writing any new ones.
Why?
Why?
A lot of reasons. But the main one would be I'm tired of it.
A lot of reasons. But the main one would be I'm tired of it.
When did you decide?
When did you decide?
It's been a long time coming. I finally made up my mind -- I guess it was Thursday.
Hi, I'm Max Cherry. Your bail bondsman.
The day you got me out of jail?
The day you got me out of jail?
Yeah, that night I went to pick up a guy. I hear he's staying at this house, so I sneak in, wait for him to come home.
Yeah, that night I went to pick up a guy. I hear he's staying at this house, so I sneak in, wait for him to come home.
Wait a minute. After we were together you went and snuck into a guy's house?
Wait a minute. After we were together you went and snuck into a guy's house?
Uh-huh.
Got another gun and a stun gun...
And went to this guy's house in El Monte, and I waited for him.
And went to this guy's house in El Monte, and I waited for him.
What do you do when he comes home?
What do you do when he comes home?
Shoot him with the stun gun. While he's incapacitated, cuff him, take 'em to County.

You do that?

That's my job.
That's my job.
Did you do it that night?
Did you do it that night?
He never came home. But I'm sitting on the couch, in the dark, holding my stun gun and the whole house smells of mildew -- So after a couple hours I think, "What am I doing here? Nineteen years of this shit? So I made up my mind, that's it.
He never came home. But I'm sitting on the couch, in the dark, holding my stun gun and the whole house smells of mildew -- So after a couple hours I think, "What am I doing here? Nineteen years of this shit? So I made up my mind, that's it.
And is that it?
And is that it?
More or less.
I'm not sure you answered my question.
Which one?
Which one?
If you had a chance, unemployed now, to walk off with a half-million dollars, would you take it?
If you had a chance, unemployed now, to walk off with a half-million dollars, would you take it?
I believe I said I'd be tempted.
Don't even think about it. You could get yourself killed go to prison...
What if I've figured a way?
The feds. It's evidence.
It may be evidence once they get their hands on it, but right now it's only money.
You're rationalizing.
That's what you do to go through with the shit you start. You rationalize. I can do this, Max, I know I can. But I can't do it without you.
I told them Ordell's changed the amount he's bringing in.
Do you think they bought it?
Do you think they bought it?
Oh, yeah. I got them thinking Ordell's real nervous. They love thinking he's scared of them.
Oh, yeah. I got them thinking Ordell's real nervous. They love thinking he's scared of them.
You know, a good cop won't let you know he knows you're fulla shit.
You know, a good cop won't let you know he knows you're fulla shit.
All he needed was a reasonable explanation.
It'll be more than that.
Don't be so literal. Ray believed it.
Don't be so literal. Ray believed it.
But you still have to show him the money at the airport.
But you still have to show him the money at the airport.
Well, you know I'm not going to show him the whole amount. He'll see fifty thousand.

Where's the rest of it?
Where's the rest of it?
In the bag underneath.

What if he checks it?

He won't -- I mean, he didn't the last time. He'll be expecting fifty thousand and there it is -- on top.

You're takin' a helluva chance kid.
You're takin' a helluva chance kid.
Not really. If he finds it, I say Mr. Walker put the money in, and I didn't know nothing about it. Like the coke.

Then you're out and you get nothing.

Yeah, but I'm not in jail and I tried.

Well, a suit. There's one I had my eye on.
How'd you find out?
All Winston had to do was ask around. Ordell's living in Long Beach with a woman junkie.

How does Winston find him if A.T.F. and all the local Police can't?
People talk to Winston. He's street, same as them, they trust him. They get busted, they know somebody who can bond them out. I thought I might drop in on him. He'll no doubt be surprised to see me.

He's liable to shoot you.
He's liable to shoot you.
On the phone I told him I have the ten thousand he put up for your bond. I could bring the money and the papers for him to sign. Walk out and call the Sheriff's department.
Ray wants him.
Everybody wants him, he's a homicide suspect. It doesn't matter who brings him in, he's gonna name you as an accessory.
That's why A.T.F.'s gotta make the case. I'm their witness. They wouldn't have a case without me. If it's his word against mine, who are they gonna believe?
It's not that simple.
It never was, so I'm not gonna start worrying about it now. Look, Ray more or less believes my story, and he more or less doesn't care. All he really gives a shit about is getting Ordell.
So how do we give Ordell to Nicolet?
So how do we give Ordell to Nicolet?
Get Ordell to come to your office.

Set him up.

Ordell called and wants to meet me and I'm scared.
Ordell called and wants to meet me and I'm scared.
We get Ordell to come to my office. Nicolet -- is he already there, or does he come busting in while we're chatting?
He's already there.
What if he hears something he's not supposed to?
What if he hears something he's not supposed to?
Well, we don't let that happen, now do we?
I got your package. It was fun getting a half-a-million dollars in the mail.
Less ten percent.
Less ten percent.
Yeah, your fee. I had to figure that out, since there wasn't no note.
Only this isn't a bail bond, Max.
I hesitated taking that much.

You worked for it -- if you're sure that's all you want.
You worked for it -- if you're sure that's all you want.
I'm sure.
I saw Ray the other day. Boy is he pissed he missed all the excitement.
What's he doing?
What's he doing?
He's on to a new thing. He's after a guy who owns a gun shop he says is "woefully and wantonly" selling assault rifles to minors. He says he's gonna take him down if it's the last thing he does.

Did you tell him you were leaving?
Did you tell him you were leaving?
I told him I might.
That's Ordell's.
They've confiscated all his other stuff. But this one's sorta left over. The registration's in the glove box, the keys were under the seat... What's a matter, haven't you ever borrowed someone's car?

You tell those guys they'll have to do one helluva lot better than that before I'll even say 'hi' to them.
Well, that's the State's offer. If you plead to possession and tell L.A.P.D. what they want to know, your bond will be set at one-thousand dollars. If you don't, L.A.P.D. will request one at twenty-five thousand based on your prior record and risk of flight. If you don't post it or don't know anyone who can, you'll spend six to eight weeks in County

Short of wearing a wire, I'll do everything I can to help you throw his ass in jail. And in exchange for my help, I need permission to leave the country and immunity.

Yeah, well, it's not a point of view that A.T.F. shares. Once we make it evidence, it belongs to us. You are now officially out of trouble. Don't do nothing stupid, now.

I got there early. I've had my eye on this suit -- Wait, let's start over. I got there early. The idea was to try on the suit, see if I liked it.

But you didn't do that.
Because I didn't have it. Ray, I swear, Melanie came in and grabbed it. And someone killed her for it.
Where's the bag she gave you?
She didn't give me one. I told you before, Melanie wasn't part of the plan. Ordell must of told her to do it. She bursts in, grabs the shopping bag, and takes off. What am I supposed to do, go after her? I'm in my fucking underwear. I had to get dressed before I could do anything. So I put this back on 'cause

I went looking for you. I went straight to the bookstore, 'cause that's where you were last time, but you weren't there. How the hell else am I supposed to let anybody know what happened? You didn't tell me how to do that, did you? I knew I was under surveillance, so when I couldn't spot anybody, I started yelling.

There was a guy with Melanie?

Not in the fitting room.
We had our agent on you. She sees a blonde come out of the fitting room carrying a Robinson's/May bag and tussle with a tough-looking white guy. The white guy takes the shopping bag and they go.
This guy with Melanie, that was Louis Gara?

Louis Gara's dead. L.A.P.D. found him dead in a car on Ninth. And we've lost Ordell.
I thought you were watching him.
I thought you were watching him.
We were, and we lost him. He walked into a strip bar sometime around three thirty and never came out. The bar was on Ninth, less than a mile- and-a-half from where Louis was found dead. It looks like Louis's friend shot him twice at point blank range.

Do you think I took some of that money?
Do you think I took some of that money?
I have no evidence of your taking anything. You didn't pay for your snazzy new suit with marked bills; I was glad to see that. You've been helping us out, you gave us Melanie and Louis. Melanie had a packet of marked bills stuffed in her shorts when they found her, which goes a long way backing up your story.
Oh, hi.

This time? Almost a year. I've known him forever.
What were you two fighting about?
What were you two fighting about?
He told me to go outside. "You may leave us now." It's all part of his pathetic attempt to be "the man." You know Mr. Walker don't you?
Mr. Walker's my buddy. Ask him about Ordell.
That coke was yours, wasn't it?
He said he didn't know about it.
You believe that? Yeah, well, I guess you have to trust him. I'd have second thoughts on that, but then I know 'em.
He killed a guy who works for him the other day.
Beaumont Livingston?
