Yes.
Why, then, things should be fine.

A little upset is all she was? Because I'll tell you, Jud, my brains feel a little like a nuclear reactor on the edge of a meltdown.

She got used to the idea. Spot lived another four years. He died peacefully in the night that second time, and I buried him in the Pet Sematary...where his bones still lie.
A man doesn't always know why he does things, Louis. I think I did it because your daughter ain't ready for her favorite pet to die.
What?
What?
Ellie's a little scared of death. And the main reason Ellie's that way is because your wife is a lot scared of death. Now you just go ahead and tell me I'm wrong.
Rachel not feeling well?
Well...a touch of the flu...
Out of the mouths of babes, Louis.
This babe has said enough.
Poor Missy. God, I was sorry to hear. I remember when she was no older'n Ellen there, walking down to the store with her Raggedy Anne doll draggin' behind her in the dust. I don't know why God takes someone like her, who should have a bunch of years still in front of them, and lets an old shit like me just go on
My father used to have a saying, Jud-- "God sees the truth, but waits."

Ayuh...how is your cat, Louis?
Ayuh...how is your cat, Louis?
It's Ellie's cat.
It's Ellie's cat.
Nope. He's your cat now.
Your father-in-law packs a wallop, for an old guy. He and his wife gone back to Chicago?
No...squatting out there at the Holiday Inn like a couple of vultures. He really thinks Rachel's going to go back with them. Her and Ellie.

Louis--
Jud, I buried my son today and I'm very tired. I wonder if we could just--
You're thinking of things best not thought of, Louis.
You're thinking of things best not thought of, Louis.
I'm thinking about going to bed.
--but I think the thought has crossed your mind.
Shit! Look at this mess!
Shit! Look at this mess!
Ayuh--it's a mess, all right.
I know the Micmacs thought it was a holy place...and then they thought it was a cursed place. That's why they moved on.
Because something called a wendigo soured the ground.

And because the dead walked.
I'll bite--what's the bottom of the truth, Jud?
Why...that sometimes dead is better. That's all. Sometimes dead is better.
I want to wake up. I want to wake up, that's all. I--
The door must not be opened. The barrier must not be crossed. Don't go on, doc. No matter how much you feel you have to. There's more power here than you know.
Please, I want to wake up. Leave me alone. It's not my fault you died; you were as good as dead when they brought you in--
The power of this place is old and always restless. Sometimes the dead do more than speak. Remember, doc.

Leave me alone!
Leave me alone!
Remember.
The door must not be opened. The barrier must not be crossed.
You don't understand--
I'll tell you where the ground is sour--the ground in my heart is sour. Let me tell you something else, Vic-baby: Wrong is wrong.
Timmy Baterman. That was wrong.
Timmy Baterman. That was wrong.
Don't talk like an asshole even if you are just a bit of underdone potato or a blot of mustard.
Let her go. It's cool.
Louis, the house is beautiful.
And Buckaroo Banzai.
Come on--let's parole 'em.
Gage's gone!
Jesus, the road!
Thank you. Thank you so much.
Yes--thanks. I'm Louis Creed.
The movers--
Yes--I know. This path, Louis? Where does it go?
Yes--I know. This path, Louis? Where does it go?
I don't have the slightest idea. When I saw the house, this field was under four feet of snow.
You're not really going over to have a beer with that old guy, are you?
Well, I've got a million questions about the area, and---

I think it's rather extraordinary.
Extraordinarily morbid, maybe.
She's finally asleep.
She was a little over-excited, that's all. Poor kid.
She was a little over-excited, that's all. Poor kid.
It was that place. That creepy cemetery up in the woods. Whatever disease the kids in this town have got, I don't want Ellie to catch it.

Jesus, Rachel, what's got into you?
Jesus, Rachel, what's got into you?
Do you think I didn't hear her tonight, crying as if her heart would break? Here she is thinking Church is going to die.
Don't be silly. Church is not going to die.
According to what Mr. Crandall says, the road's a lot more dangerous than the operation. Church will be just the same. Well--almost the same--and we won't have to worry about him getting turned into catburgers by one of those damn Orinco trucks.
That's enough of that kind of talk!
I just said--
I just said--
I know what you just said. Ellie, clear your place.
You'll be fine, Ellie. Now you can be excused. Go and wash your face.
And Church will be fine.
Well, honey...you know that...
Don't shilly-shally, Louis. Give the little girl her promise.
Thank you, Louis.
Oh, you're welcome. Only if some- thing should go wrong while he's under the gas--it's a one-in-a-thousand shot, but it happens--you explain to her.
Getting there.
I got eggs down here!

Good d--
I heard you tonight.
I thought maybe you did. I know you don't approve of the subject being raised--
I thought maybe you did. I know you don't approve of the subject being raised--
That's not true. The subject scares me. Because of Zelda.
I'm sorry I couldn't go with you to Missy's funeral. And that I blew up when we went to that silly animal graveyard.
That's forgotten.
That's forgotten.
Not by me, it isn't. I know how badly I acted, how unfair I was. It's just that I..you know.
Not by me, it isn't. I know how badly I acted, how unfair I was. It's just that I..you know.
Yes, I guess I do.
I'm going to try to do better.
You're doing fine.
You better get going, hon.
Oh Louis, I just don't know about this--
Oh Louis, I just don't know about this--
I told you last night--this can be the start of patching things up with your folks. If something good doesn't come of Gage's death, I think I'll go crazy.

Louis, are you sure?
Louis, are you sure?
I'm sure.
You stole my boat.
AnaMaria! Have you seen Gibbs? I need to put together --
My dory. The Jolly Mon. Where is it?
Safe! At Port Royal. With the Royal Navy.

That boat is my livelihood!

You'll get it back. Or one better.
You'll get it back. Or one better.
I will.
How does he do that?
They'll be anchored on the lee side. Haul your wind, and keep to the weather of the island --
AnaMaria, trim the mainsail!
Aye, aye, sir!
Aye, aye, sir!
Mr. Gibbs, organize a cleaning detail -- you and Cotton. I want every inch of the Pearl spic-and- span and ship-shape!
What's in your head, boy?
She. Goes. Free.
She. Goes. Free.
You've got one shot -- and we can't die.
You've got one shot -- and we can't die.
You can't. I can.
Enough of that! Name your terms.
Elizabeth goes free!
Elizabeth goes free!
We got that part. Anything else?
We got that part. Anything else?
And Jack. And the crew. Free and unharmed. If you agree ... then ... I will remain with you.
You must swear by the Holy Bible.
Eh? You have my word, then -- on the Good Book, I do swear, and the Lord spare my worthless soul.
No! You gave your word!
Quite, boy, or you'll lose your tongue. Those as know me know I wouldn't cross my word, and bring down bad luck on the ship. I agreed to set them free. I didn't when ... nor where.
Hah. Ten years you carried that pistol, and you end up wasting your shot.
He didn't waste it.
I know whose blood you need, to end the curse.
Say the name, or I slit your throat.
Say the name, or I slit your throat.
No you won't.
Allow me the humor of listening to your terms.
Simple. I have something you won't more than anything. The way to free you from the curse of the treasure. You have something I want -- more than anything.

The Pearl? Oh, that's fine. And just how do you expect this to work?
The Pearl? Oh, that's fine. And just how do you expect this to work?
You give me the Pearl. Then I tell you who you need.
That's your offer? You, sailing away nice and pretty with the Black Pearl, and all I have is a name?
That's right.
That's right.
I'm supposed to ... trust you?
You see, I've got this honest streak in me -- in its own way, a sort of curse. Oh, and there's the fact that you have no choice.
I'll torture it out of you.
I'll torture it out of you.
You left me on a desert island -- what worse can you do?
Blast you! I'll throw you in prison.
Wait as long as you like.
Wait as long as you like.
You're setting me up for a double cross, you with the ship, and me with nothing more than your word!
You're setting me up for a double cross, you with the ship, and me with nothing more than your word!
Let's say I tell you the wrong person. What would you do?
Let's say I tell you the wrong person. What would you do?
Track you down and --
Jack, I don't trust you, and that's a fact. Never trust a smiling man, you can lay to that.
See, that's where we're different. I trust you ... to do what it takes to get what you want.
See, that's where we're different. I trust you ... to do what it takes to get what you want.
You're playing this as close to the edge as any man, I'll give you that. We might just have to sign articles, you and I. Jack, you're a pirate at heart, that's certain.
What -- you don't have the medallion?
That fool woman took it. You be careful around her, Jack -- she's pretty enough, she'll steal your heart -- but pure evil inside.
That fool woman took it. You be careful around her, Jack -- she's pretty enough, she'll steal your heart -- but pure evil inside.
I'll watch my back.
I'll watch my back.
Bosun! Set up Mr. Sparrow's quarters, nice and fine ... in the brig. Meaning no disrespect, of course.
It's pure evil to make a Captain walk the plank of his own ship, twice in one lifetime. No good can come of it.
Now, Jack. That reef is less than a league distant. It's a square deal all around, and you can't hope for better.
Now, Jack. That reef is less than a league distant. It's a square deal all around, and you can't hope for better.
Someone needs to cut these bonds, then.
You'd best take a swim, Jack.
The last time you do this, you left me a pistol, with one shot.
So how did you get off that island, anyway?
You can go to your grave not knowing.
You can go to your grave not knowing.
That's fair.
No, I really think I do.
All right then.
Why don't I want to do this?
Because, right about now, the H.M.S. Dauntless is lying in wait in the harbor.
You've no hope of surviving Norrington's attack ... that is, if you're mortal.
What're you suggesting?
Like after you've killed ... Every ... Last ... One ... of Norrington's men.
I can't help wondering, Jack, why you're being so helpful and all? Last time you did that, it didn't end well for you.
I can't help wondering, Jack, why you're being so helpful and all? Last time you did that, it didn't end well for you.
The situation has changed.
The situation has changed.
That so?
That so?
Aye. See, after you're done with the Royal Navy, you'll have a bit of a problem: the H.M.S. Dauntless. There you'll be, with two lovely ships on your hands, and what to do? Of course you'll decide you deserve the bigger one, and who's to argue? The Dauntless a first- rate ship-of-line, and with it, you can rule the seas. But if you're Captain
Now, you can take care of the Dauntless, right?
Men! Are you up for it?
There's ... another exit?
Aye, for us there is.
Just so you know, Jack -- I don't think you're that clever. I think you're a fool. A mortal fool.
Remarkable how often those two traits coincide.
So what now, Jack Sparrow? Are we to be two immortals, locked in epic battle until the trumpets of Judgement Day?
Or you could surrender.
Now?
Now. No, don't kill him.
Looks like your back to having nothing to offer.
And he's got Old Bill's courage. A curse on him, and you!
That's proper, sir, according to the code.
By the powers, you're right! Where's Jack's pistol? Who's got it? Bring it forward!
No reason to fret. It's just a prick of the finger and a few drops of blood.
Turner blood doesn't flow pure in his veins. Best play it safe, and spill it all.
Turner blood doesn't flow pure in his veins. Best play it safe, and spill it all.
I guess there is a reason to fret.
Do you believe him?
No. But him I believe. He us genuinely angry.
My apologies, miss. As you were saying, before you were so rudely interrupted?
Captain Barbossa ... I have come to negotiate the cessation of hostilities against Port Royal.
There was a lot of long words in there, miss, and we're not but humble pirates. What is it you want?
I want you to leave. And never come back.
I am disinclined to acquiesce to your request. Means 'No.'
Very well.
I'll drop it!
My holds are bursting with swag. That bit of shine matters to me ... Why?
My holds are bursting with swag. That bit of shine matters to me ... Why?
Because it's what you're searching for. You've been searching for it for years. I recognize this ship. I saw it eight years ago, when we made the crossing from England.
Because it's what you're searching for. You've been searching for it for years. I recognize this ship. I saw it eight years ago, when we made the crossing from England.
Did you, now?
You have a name, missy?
Elizabeth -- Turner. I'm a maid in the governor's household.
You've got sand, for a maid.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, sir.
And how does a maid come to own a trinket such as that? A family heirloom, perhaps?
And how does a maid come to own a trinket such as that? A family heirloom, perhaps?
Of course. I didn't steal it, if that's what you mean.
Of course. I didn't steal it, if that's what you mean.
No, no, nothing like that. Very well. You hand that over, we'll put your town to our rudder and ne'er return.
No, no, nothing like that. Very well. You hand that over, we'll put your town to our rudder and ne'er return.
Can I trust you?
Can I trust you?
It's you who invoked the parlay! Believe me, Miss, you'd best hand it over, now ... or these be the last friendly words you'll hear!
Maid or not, it fits you.
Dare I ask the fate of it previous owner?
Dare I ask the fate of it previous owner?
Now, none of that. Please dig in.
Oh, there would be no sense in killing you, Miss Turner.
Then why aren't you eating?
Then why aren't you eating?
Would that I could.
Do you not know what this is, then?
It's a pirate medallion.
It's a pirate medallion.
It's a piece of the treasure of Isla de Muerta.
The curse drove you to gather this?
Aye. And not a bit of it any use to us, only hoarded. But it will drive us no longer.
Agreed. You have my word, as a gentleman of fortune --
Will -- you can't trust him.
I think it would be rather exciting to meet a pirate.
Think again, Miss Swann. Vile and dissolute creatures, the lot of them. I intend to see to it that any man who sails under a pirate flag, or wears a pirate brand, gets what he deserves: a short drop and a sudden stop.
Man overboard!
Boy overboard!
Boy overboard!
Fetch a hook -- haul him out of there!
Did he speak?
His name is Will Turner -- that's all I found out.
His name is Will Turner -- that's all I found out.
Very good.
I apologize if I seem forward -- but I must speak my mind. This promotion confirms that I have accomplished the goals I set for myself in my career. But it also casts into sharp relief that which I have not achieved. The thing all men most require: a marriage to a fine woman. You have become a fine woman, Elizabeth.
I can't breathe.
I can't breathe.
I'm a bit nervous, myself --
Commodore, I must protest. Pirate or not, this man saved my life.
One good deed is not enough to redeem a man of a lifetime of wickedness.
On his heels! Gillette, bring a squad down from the fort! Elizabeth, are you --
Yes, I'm all right, I'm fine! Go capture him.
Elizabeth, I'm relieved you're safe. Clap him in irons. And behind his back this time.
Commodore, you can't do that!
Commodore, you can't do that!
You're speaking up for him again?
You're speaking up for him again?
He can locate Isla de Muerta -- but I doubt he'll be willing to help us from the brig.
No. The pirates have taken Will --
Your father is frantic with worry. Our mission was to rescue you and return home. That is what we shall do. Mr. Turner's fate is regrettable. But so was his decision to engage in piracy.
Your father is frantic with worry. Our mission was to rescue you and return home. That is what we shall do. Mr. Turner's fate is regrettable. But so was his decision to engage in piracy.
Commodore, please!
Commodore, I beg you -- please do this ... for me. As a wedding gift.
I am to understand that you will accept my marriage proposal on the condition I rescue Mr. Turner?
I am to understand that you will accept my marriage proposal on the condition I rescue Mr. Turner?
Not as a condition -- a request.
Elizabeth, I hereby withdraw my proposal.
What?
What?
I know where your heart truly lies.
You may seclude yourself in my cabin. I'm afraid we do not have any ladies' clothing aboard.
Then I can wear men's clothing.
Then I can wear men's clothing.
That would hardly be proper.
That would hardly be proper.
Well, I am not going to stay hidden in some cabin, or I suppose it's going to be heaving bosoms and bare for the remainder of the voyage!
Actually, I find it all fascinating.
And that's what concerns me. Elizabeth, we will be landing in Port Royal soon, and beginning our new lives. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we comport ourselves as befits our class and station?
And that's what concerns me. Elizabeth, we will be landing in Port Royal soon, and beginning our new lives. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we comport ourselves as befits our class and station?
Yes, father.
Elizabeth? Is everything all right? Are you decent?
Yes -- yes.
It's -- beautiful. May I inquire as to the occasion?
Is an occasion necessary for a father to dote upon his daughter with gifts?
Although ... I did think you could wear it to the ceremony today.
Ceremony?
Ceremony?
Captain Norrington's promotion ceremony.
I knew it.
Or, rather, Commodore Norrington ... a fine gentleman, don't you think? He fancies you, you know.
Difficult ... to say.
I'm told that dress is the very latest fashion in London.
I'm told that dress is the very latest fashion in London.
Women in London must have learned to not breathe.
Elizabeth, this is hardly appropriate --
About the day we met. Do you remember?
What?
Parlay! I invoke the right of parlay! According to the Code of the Brethern, set down by the pirates Morgan and Bartholomew, you must take me to your Captain!
Parlay! I invoke the right of parlay! According to the Code of the Brethern, set down by the pirates Morgan and Bartholomew, you must take me to your Captain!
I know the code.
I know the code.
If an adversary demands parlay, you can do them no harm until the parlay is complete.
If an adversary demands parlay, you can do them no harm until the parlay is complete.
It would appear, so do you.
You'll be dining with the Captain, and he requests you wear this.
Tell the captain that I am disinclined to acquiesce to his request.
Tell the captain that I am disinclined to acquiesce to his request.
He said you say that! He also said if that be the case, you'll be dining with the crew, and you'll be naked.
I could never forget it, Miss Swann.
Will, how many times must I ask you to call me 'Elizabeth'?
Will, how many times must I ask you to call me 'Elizabeth'?
At least once more, Miss Swann. As always.
I'm glad we got here in time.
Truthfully -- you were a bit late.
Why would my father send this to me?
To keep it away from them? No pirate would sail to London, for fear of Execution Dock.
To keep it away from them? No pirate would sail to London, for fear of Execution Dock.
If I had known --
If I had known --
-- then we never would have met.
I can't believe he would make such a sacrifice for us.
I guess you can never truly know someone else's heart.
There. And don't you dare tell me that wasn't a proper kiss!
Elizabeth, I think it doesn't matter that we are of a different class --
Elizabeth, I think it doesn't matter that we are of a different class --
It doesn't!
It doesn't!
-- but that was not a proper kiss.
Miss Swann.
Miss Swann, if you'll be so kind?
You are despicable.
I saved your life; now you've saved mine. We're square.
You?!
Me!
Me!
You're in league with Barbossa!
You're in league with Barbossa!
No, I'm -- rescuing you.
Come on!
No. This won't work. I'll stay behind, and fight them. You go on.
Has it changed since the last time you were here?
The trees are taller.
Captain Sparrow! We have to get off this island -- immediately!
Don't be thinking I'm not already working on it.
What? What's wrong? How will this help us get off the island?
It won't. It won't, and so we won't.
But ... you did it before! Last time --
Last time, I was here a grand total of three days. Last time, the rumrunners who used this island as a cache came by, and I bartered passage off. But from the looks of this, they've been out of business, and so that won't be happening again. We probably have your friend Norrington to thank for that.

So that's it? That's the secret grand adventure of the infamous Jack Sparrow? You spent three days on the beach drinking rum?
So that's it? That's the secret grand adventure of the infamous Jack Sparrow? You spent three days on the beach drinking rum?
Welcome to the Caribbean, love.
You should look at our contretemps this way: we've got shade trees, thank the Lord. We've got some food on the trees, thank the Lord again. And we've got rum, praise the Lord. We can stay alive a month, maybe more. Keep a weather eye open for passing ships, and our chances are fair.
A month? Will doesn't have a month! We've got to do something to help him!
A month? Will doesn't have a month! We've got to do something to help him!
You're right. Here's luck to you, Will Turner.
Don't be thinking I'm happy about this, Elizabeth. But I see no use in wailing and gnashing my teeth over that which I can do nothing about.
Not when you can drink instead, at least.
Drink up me hearties, yo ho ...
What? What was that? Something funny, Miss Swann? Share, please.
What? What was that? Something funny, Miss Swann? Share, please.
Nothing ... it's nothing. Just ... I'm reminded of a song I learned as a child. A song about pirates.

I know a lot of songs about pirates, but none I'd teach a child. Let's hear it.
I know a lot of songs about pirates, but none I'd teach a child. Let's hear it.
Oh, no ... it's silly. Back in England we didn't know a thing about pirates, really. They seemed so romantic and daring --
That was before I met one, of course.
Now I must hear this song. An authentic pirate song. Have at it.

Well, perhaps ... with a bit more to drink, I might ...
Well, perhaps ... with a bit more to drink, I might ...
More to drink!
When I get the Black Pearl back, I'm going to teach it to the whole crew, and we'll sing it all the time!
You'll be positively the most fearsome pirates to sail the Spanish Main.
Jack, it must be so terrible for you, to be trapped here on this island, all over again.
Ah, well ... the company is better than last time. And the scenery has definitely improved.

Mr. Sparrow! I'm not sure I've had enough rum to allow that kind of talk.
Mr. Sparrow! I'm not sure I've had enough rum to allow that kind of talk.
We've got a few bottles left ... and we've yet to tap the kegs.
To freedom.
To the Black Pearl.
What are you doing? You've burned our food, the shade -- the rum!
Yes, the rum is gone.
Why?
One, because it is a vile drink that turns even the most respectable men into scoundrels. Two --
That signal is over a thousand feet high, which means it can be seen for two hundred leagues in every direction. The entire Royal Navy is out to sea looking for me -- do you think there is even a chance they could miss it?
You -- you burned up the island, for a one-time chance at being spotted?
You -- you burned up the island, for a one-time chance at being spotted?
Exactly.
You didn't tell Commodore Norrington everything.
Nor did you, I noticed.

He might delay the rescue ... and that would be too late.

I have a plan. If it succeeds, then any battle will be decidedly brief ... and one-sided.
I have a plan. If it succeeds, then any battle will be decidedly brief ... and one-sided.
What's your plan?
Curse you for breathing, you slack- jawed idiot. Mother's love, Jack, you know better than to wake a man when he's sleeping. It's bad luck!
Well, fortunately, I know how to counter it. The man who did the waking buys the man who was sleeping a drink, and the man who was sleeping it drinks it while listening to a proposition.
Well, fortunately, I know how to counter it. The man who did the waking buys the man who was sleeping a drink, and the man who was sleeping it drinks it while listening to a proposition.
Aye, that'll about do it.
Make it last, then. Now, what's the nature of this venture of yours?
First -- have you found me a crew?
First -- have you found me a crew?
Oh, there's a hard tale, Jack. Most of the decent pirates in town won't sail with you -- seem to think you're a jinx.
Oh, there's a hard tale, Jack. Most of the decent pirates in town won't sail with you -- seem to think you're a jinx.
Now where, I wonder, would they have gotten that idea?

Not if the fool has something Barbossa wants. Something he needs.
Not if the fool has something Barbossa wants. Something he needs.
And you've got that, have you?
Kid's a bit of a stick, isn't he?
That he is.
We'd best drop canvas, sir!
She can hold a bit longer.
What's in your head to put you in such a fine mood?
We're catching up!
How did you get off the island?
Ah, that's a dark and unpleasant tale, best left untold.
Blast it, I'm already awake!
I know. That was for the smell.
How do we expect to find an island no one can find -- with a compass that doesn't work?
Now, lad, just because it don't point north don't mean it don't work. That compass gives bearings to the Isla de Muerta, wherever it may lay.
Now, lad, just because it don't point north don't mean it don't work. That compass gives bearings to the Isla de Muerta, wherever it may lay.
Really? So ... what's the story on the pistol?
I'll tell lee. Now, Jack Sparrow has an honest streak in him, and that's where the whole problem starts. This was when he was Captain of the Black Pearl --
What? He never told me that.
What? He never told me that.
Ah -- he's learned, then. Plays things more close to the vest. See, Jack was a cartographer, back in Old England. Somehow he came by the money to commission the Pearl. Hired himself a crew, promised each man an equal share. So, they're forty days out, and the First Mate says, everything's an equal share, that should mean the location of the island, too.
Jack gave hisself up for the sake of his loyal crew. He was marooned on an island, left there to die.
How did he get off the island?
It's a signal. If we resist, it won't just be death. There'll be torture as well.
We're not going to just surrender!
We're not going to just surrender!
That we are.
We can at least fight -- we might be able to kill a few--
Will -- it'll go worse for us -- for Elizabeth, especially -- if we fight.
Raise the sails.
The wind is quarter from astern ... by the time we're underway, we'll never catch them.
The wind is quarter from astern ... by the time we're underway, we'll never catch them.
We need only to come about, to put them in range of the long nines.
Hands! Come about! Jackets off the cannons! We are to fire on our own ship?
Better to see it at the bottom of the sea than in the hands of a pirate.
All the men in place, sir. Ready to fire.
Wait for my order -- what the blazes is that?
Sir! Shall I break out the cannons?
I don't think that will be necessary.
Dead serious.
You understand this ship cannot be crewed by only two men. You'll never make it out of the bay.
You understand this ship cannot be crewed by only two men. You'll never make it out of the bay.
We'll see about that.
Sir, I'll not see any of my men killed or wounded in this foolish enterprise.
Fine by me. We brought you a nice little boat, so you can all get back to shore, safe and sound.
Fine by me. We brought you a nice little boat, so you can all get back to shore, safe and sound.
Agreed. You have the momentary advantage, sir. But I will see you smile from the yard arm, sir.
Agreed. You have the momentary advantage, sir. But I will see you smile from the yard arm, sir.
As likely as not. Will, short up the anchor, we've got ourselves a ship!
This dock is off-limits to civilians.
Sorry, I didn't know.
Some sort of to-do up at the fort, eh? You two weren't invited?
No ... somone has to make sure this dock stays off-limits to civilians.
No ... somone has to make sure this dock stays off-limits to civilians.
This must be some important boat.
That's a fine goal, I'm sure ... But it seems to me a ship like that -- -- makes this one here just a wee superflous.
Oh, the Dauntless is the power in these waters, true enough -- but there's no ship that can match the Interceptor for speed.
Oh, the Dauntless is the power in these waters, true enough -- but there's no ship that can match the Interceptor for speed.
That so? I've heard of one, supposed to be fast, neigh uncatchable ... the Black Pearl?
What's your name?
Smith.
None? Very well. You rumbled me. I confess: I intend to commandeer one of these ships, pick up a crew in Tortuga, and go on the account, do a little honest pirating.
I said, no lies.
Well, well... Jack Sparrow, isn't it?
Captain Jack Sparrow. If you please.
Taking stock: you've got a pistol with only one shot, a compass that doesn't point north ... and no ship. You are without a doubt the worst pirate I have ever heard of.
Ah, but you have heard of me.
But it seems to be enough to condemn him.
Indeed.
We had time to get to know each other.
We are bound for Port Royal, not Isla de Muerta.
Norrington, think about it ... the Black Pearl, its captain and crew ... the last pirate threat in the Caribbean. How can you pass that up?
By remembering that I serve others, not only myself.
I don't like the situation, Mister Sparrow. The island is riddled with caves. I will not put my men at a disadvantage.
Funny, I was thinking along those lines. How about you let me go in alone, and while you're setting up an ambush, I'll trick the pirates out to you.
Funny, I was thinking along those lines. How about you let me go in alone, and while you're setting up an ambush, I'll trick the pirates out to you.
You would do that?
You would do that?
They left me stranded. Twice. What have you got to lose?
They left me stranded. Twice. What have you got to lose?
Nothing I wouldn't be please to be rid of.
Nothing I wouldn't be please to be rid of.
I knew you'd listen to reason!
That chart I drew up'll get you past the reefs. If you're steersman's good enough, that is.
I'll be at the wheel myself.
I'll be at the wheel myself.
I'll slip in, talk them into to come out, and you'll be free to blow holy high heaven the whole lot of them.
You look familiar ... Have I ever threatened you before?
I've made a point of avoiding familiarity with pirates.
I've made a point of avoiding familiarity with pirates.
Ah. Then it would be a shame to put a black mark on your record. So if you'll excuse me ...
Do you think this is wise, boy? Crossing blades with a pirate?
You threatened Miss Swann.
You threatened Miss Swann.
Only a little.
Who makes all these?
I do. And I practice with them. At least three hours a day.
I do. And I practice with them. At least three hours a day.
You need to find yourself a girl. Or maybe the reason you practice three hours a day is you've found one -- but can't get her?
You cheated.
Pirate.
Move away.
No.
No.
Move!
Move!
No. I can not just step aside and let you escape.
Are you familiar with that ship? The Black Pearl?
Somewhat.
Somewhat.
Where does it make berth?
Where does it make berth?
Surely you've heard the stories? The Black Pearl sails from the dreaded Isla de Mureta ... an island that cannot be found -- except by those who already know where it is.

The ship's real enough. So its anchorage must be a real place. Where is it?

Why ask me?
Why ask me?
Because you're a pirate.
Because you're a pirate.
And you want to turn pirate yourself?
And you want to turn pirate yourself?
Never. They took Miss Swann.
Never. They took Miss Swann.
So it is that you found a girl. Well, if you're intending to brave all and hasten to her rescue and so win fair lady's heart, you'll have to do it alone. I see no profit in it for me.
I can get you out of here.
How? The key's run off.
How? The key's run off.
I helped build these cells. Those are hook-and-ring hinges. The proper application of strength, the door'll lift free. Just calls for the right lever and fulcrum ...
Agreed.
Agreed!
Not without my effects.
We need to go!
Why are brothering with that?
My business, Will. As for your business -- one question, or there's no use going. This girl -- what does she mean to you? How far are you willing to go to save her?
My business, Will. As for your business -- one question, or there's no use going. This girl -- what does she mean to you? How far are you willing to go to save her?
I'd die for her.
I'd die for her.
Good.
Come aboard.
I haven't set foot off dry land since I was twelve, when the ship I was on exploded. It's been a sound policy.
I haven't set foot off dry land since I was twelve, when the ship I was on exploded. It's been a sound policy.
No worries there. She's far more likely to rot out from under us.
We're going to steal a ship? That ship?
Commandeer. We're going to commandeer a ship. Nautical term.
Commandeer. We're going to commandeer a ship. Nautical term.
It's still against the law.
It's still against the law.
So's breaking a man out of jail. Face it, Will: you may say you'll never be a pirate, but you're off to a rip-roaring start. My advice -- smile and enjoy it.
This is either crazy, or brilliant.
Remarkable how often those two traits coincide.
Everybody stay calm. We're taking over the ship!
Aye! Avast!
For a man whose made an industry of avoiding boats, you're a quick study.
I worked passage from England as a cabin boy. After my mother passed, I came out here ... looking for my father.
I worked passage from England as a cabin boy. After my mother passed, I came out here ... looking for my father.
Is that so?
Is that so?
My father. William Turner?
I knew him. Probably one of the few he knew him as William Turner. Most everyone just called him Bill, or 'Bootstrap' Bill.
'Bootstrap?'
'Bootstrap?'
Good man. Good pirate. And clever -- I never met anyone with as clever a mind and hands as him. When you were puzzling out that cell door, it was like seeing his twin.

That's not true.

I swear, you look just like him.

It's not true my father was a pirate.

He was a merchant marine! He was a respectable man who obeyed the law, and followed the rules--
He was a merchant marine! He was a respectable man who obeyed the law, and followed the rules--
You think your father is the only man who ever lived the Glasgow life, telling folk one thing, and then going off to do another? There's quite a few who come here, hoping to amass enough swag to ease the burdens of respectable life. And they're all 'merchant marines.'

My father did not think of my mother -- his family -- as a burden.
My father did not think of my mother -- his family -- as a burden.
Sure -- because he could always go pirating.

Put it away, Will. It's not worth getting beat again.
You didn't beat me. You ignored the rule of engagement. In a fair fight, I'd kill you.
You didn't beat me. You ignored the rule of engagement. In a fair fight, I'd kill you.
Then that's not much incentive for me to fight fair, is it?
Tortuga?
Oh -- did I forget to mention that?
Just do it quickly.
Don't worry. I've already got a Quartermaster -- there!
Shut up, before you lose them all!
These are the only ones worth having. And we're going to need them --
Wait -- what about the pistol?
The pistol. When a pirate is marooned, Will, he's given a pistol with a single shot. No good for hunting, or surviving, really. But after three weeks of starvation and thrist -- the option of that pistol begins to look good.
But I survived. And I still have that single shot. It's meant for one man. My mutinous first mate--
Barbossa.
What's that?
Depends.
Depends.
On what?
On what?
On whether the stories are all true. If they are, that's a waterfall that spills over at high tide, with a short drop to an underground lagoon. If not --
Miss Swann! We're here to rescue you! It's going badly!
This way!
No.
I'll lead them away.
Go to the opposite end of the island, and signal the ship. I'll keep 'em busy.
Are you sure? Jack -- this is not something you have to do.
Are you sure? Jack -- this is not something you have to do.
I'm sure. When you've led the kind of life that I have, there are debts that must be paid. Maybe I can balance the scales a little.
Will -- don't do anything stupid! Don't say anything stupid --
My name is Will Turner, the son of Bootstrap Bill Turner. His blood runs in my veins. You need my blood. And on my word I will pull this trigger, and sink all the way down to Davy Jones' Locker!
Do you have any idea where you're going?
Jack!
Jack!
Don't talk. These caves magnify sound. Just follow me.
Are you certain this is the right way?
It's the right way.
Jack!
-- and its guns and crew will cut you and your men to pieces the moment you step outside these caves.
Well, you're the worst pirate I've ever heard of. You're a man who can be trusted, who can be counted on, and who can't betray his friends. What kind of pirate is that?
The worst. On the other hand, maybe I'm a man who can't pass up a chance for revenge against the black-hearted bastard who stole my ship and left me to die in the middle of the ocean -- twice! -- and who knows how to get what he wants. Now that's a great pirate.
There's no *real* ship as can match the Interceptor.
The Black Pearl is a real ship.
The Black Pearl is a real ship.
No, it's not.
No, it's not.
Yes it is. I've seen it.
Yes it is. I've seen it.
You've seen it?
You've seen it?
Yes.
Yes.
You've seen the Black Pearl?
You've seen the Black Pearl?
Yes.
Yes.
You haven't seen it.
You haven't seen it.
Yes, I have.
Yes, I have.
You've seen a ship with black sails that's crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out?
You've seen a ship with black sails that's crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out?
... No.
... No.
No.
No.
But I've seen a ship with black sails.
But I've seen a ship with black sails.
Oh, and no ship that's not crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out could possibly have black sails and therefore couldn't possibly be any ship other than the Black Pearl. Is that what you're saying?
Oh, and no ship that's not crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out could possibly have black sails and therefore couldn't possibly be any ship other than the Black Pearl. Is that what you're saying?

... no.
Like I said, there's no real ship as can match -- Hey!
What's your business in Port Royal, 'Mr. Smith'?
And no lies!
I think he's telling the truth.
He's not telling the truth.
He's not telling the truth.
He may be.
He may be.
If he were telling truth he wouldn't have told us.
That Jack Sparrow ... he talked about the Black Pearl.
Mentioned it, is more what he did.
Mentioned it, is more what he did.
Still --
Captain Norrington... I appreciate your fervor, but I am concerned about the effect this subject will have on my daughter.
My apologies, Governor.
He's still breathing.
Where did he come from?
What happened here?
An explosion in the powder magazine. Merchant vessels run heavily armed.
Has my daughter given you an answer yet?
No. She hasn't.
No. She hasn't.
Well, she had a very taxing day... Ghastly weather tonight.
Well, she had a very taxing day... Ghastly weather tonight.
Bleak. Very bleak.
Commodore --
A moment.
A moment.
But --
But --
Please.
Please.
Dammit, man, it appears someone is stealing your ship!
How long do you leave him in there?
Until he's done.
Mr. Sim, when you do locate him. Do not scare him off again. Just watch him. I think you can handle that. Right, Mr. Sim?
You got it, Dr. Argon.
Look, I don't mean to rain on everyone's ascension here, but we got a little problem.
Speak.
Speak.
Dr. Bright has escaped.
Dr. Argon, everything's starting to come apart here. You hired me to take care of these matters of security and I am trying, but elements are making my job impossible.
Have you found Dr. Bright?
Have you found Dr. Bright?
No. The captain of the containment crew is closing down the main lab. He says the area has got to be evacuated.
Wheelchair accessible.
Dr. Argon, I demand an explanation.
Not anymore, Mr. O'Brien. The nanobot has changed that.
If you think I would ever give you the nanobot after this, you are deluding yourself.
If you think I would ever give you the nanobot after this, you are deluding yourself.
You don't have to give it to us because Dr. Nebbleman can just cut it out of him.
Mr. Sim I want you to return to Dr. Bright's. I believe she is hiding something of ours there.
No.
Dr. Bright, I don't have to do anything.
But in another twenty-four hours the core meltdown will be beyond the stabilization period. There will be no way to stop it.
But in another twenty-four hours the core meltdown will be beyond the stabilization period. There will be no way to stop it.
To be brutally honest with you, Susan, as long as the nanobot does to me what it did to that idiot O'Brien, I don't give a rat's ass about what happens after that.
You can't mean that.
Come with me, Susan. I want to show you something.
Something to drink, Dr. Bright?
No, thank you.
No, thank you.
You'll forgive me but all the excitement has left me extremely parched. Poppy?
We will always love most that which we create. Don't you agree, Susan?
Does that mean Oppenheimer loved the atomic bomb?
I brought you up here, Dr. Bright, because I want you to understand that we are on the path. The only difference is that you are walking with your head down, afraid to look up, to see where the path is going.
I suppose you are going to tell me where it is going.
I suppose you are going to tell me where it is going.
I ask you what is the purpose of science? What is the point of all our relentless exploration, investigation and experimentation? It is to understand a single physical phenomenon, or to understand them all? To cure one disease, or to cure every disease? If science is simply a means, what then is the end?
Pollution?
Do you know what I see? I see man making his own clouds. I see man coloring his own sky, and like this garden it is a site that makes my heart sing.
This is our world, Susan, and once you realize that, you will understand that the only place our path can end is on the throne of heaven. Science is the quest for divine perfection.
How do you know we're not heading in the wrong direction?
How do you know we're not heading in the wrong direction?
I look behind us, I look to the past, to a world steeped in rot and decay. I think of the Acropolis in another century reduced to little more than dust. I see the faces of Rushmore eventually losing all distinction, and then I look at this...
I swear to you, Argon, if you don't stop the meltdown that nanobot will be the last one I ever build.
Susan, I sense you are having difficulty understanding the situation you are presently in. I ask that you keep in mind that I am ready to reduce an entire city to gelatin to get what I want.
What are you going to do to him?
Do? Well, I suppose that depends on you.
What did you use?
A light mixture of oxygen, dioxide, and sodium pentothal. He'll sleep, that's all.
I can explain it. Attempted murder wasn't enough for him. He wants to add kidnapping to the charges.
If you'd like, we can go straight to the authorities. I understand they are very interested in talking to you.
... plastic.
Wow, that is one moving story. Take it easy on my heart strings. Now I really feel guilty complaining about you shooting me up with your poison.
Wow, that is one moving story. Take it easy on my heart strings. Now I really feel guilty complaining about you shooting me up with your poison.
Poison? I'm surprised at you. You lack vision, Mr. O'Brien.
Poison? I'm surprised at you. You lack vision, Mr. O'Brien.
You're lacking a few things too: ethics, morals, common decency and, oh yeah, deodorant.
The body is just another part of nature and ever since we gave up trees for central air, there has been nothing sacred about nature. Nature is the enemy, Mr. O'Brien, and science is our greatest weapon against her.
You egomaniacs make me laugh. Nature's going to bury you like she buries everyone else.
I should kill you right now for what you did to me!
Maybe you should, but you can't.
How apropos.
Ain't it.
As you can see I am a new man, just like you.
Oh no. You're not like me. In fact, I'm betting you're the same greedy, remorseless, egomaniacal bad guy you always were.
It remains to be seen who is the good guy and who is the bad guy. History is written by the victor.
The only history I'm gonna write is your obituary!
I know what you're doing.
You mean besides kicking your ass?!
You mean besides kicking your ass?!
You think you can use me to stop the meltdown.
Please, O'Brien, don't do this to me! I'll give you anything you want!
Yeah, I'm going to finish what you started --
You can't do this! You owe me, O'Brien. I made you plastic! I made you!
That's right. And making me was the biggest mistake you ever made!
Like rotting meat.
You're not rotting meat.
Oh no? Smell this.
Icarus, please, if you want me to give you a bath just say so.
Icarus, please, if you want me to give you a bath just say so.
No. I'm getting used to it.
She's working as fast as she can, Icarus. It will be ready soon.
It's ready now, I know it is.
It's ready now, I know it is.
She says it's not.
She says it's not.
She's lying. She lost the first one on purpose.
She's lying. She lost the first one on purpose.
She did not. The mouse ran down the drain.
She did not. The mouse ran down the drain.
She let it escape because she wants me to die.
She let it escape because she wants me to die.
Don't be a child, Icarus. She is just another scientist and like all scientists, she doesn't care about anything outside the world of the laboratory.
Icky! What's happening?
Who cares! We've got to find him! Hurry!
It works, Poppy. It works, it works!
Now, Icky, I don't need you winding yourself up. I need you focused and in control.
Now, Icky, I don't need you winding yourself up. I need you focused and in control.
But, Poppy, you don't know what this means --
But, Poppy, you don't know what this means --
You don't either. We won't know anything until we find that guy and find out if he's alive or what.
You don't either. We won't know anything until we find that guy and find out if he's alive or what.
Yes, that's true. We have to find him, run tests, determine if the polymerization is stable.
Yes, that's true. We have to find him, run tests, determine if the polymerization is stable.
In the meantime, we're going to need someone to deal with that mess in the lab. I don't think we should call Dr. Bright.
In the meantime, we're going to need someone to deal with that mess in the lab. I don't think we should call Dr. Bright.
Oh no. No. We'll get her assistant. What's-his-name? Nebbishman?
Oh no. No. We'll get her assistant. What's-his-name? Nebbishman?
Nebbleman.
A containment crew is going to attract a lot of attention.
You're right. Place a call to our friends at the network and to Mr. Joplin at the E.P.A.
Gently, Ott. Gently.
Dr. Nebbleman, I want to know the moment the nanobot arrives. The instant, understand?
Do you think she will give us the designs?
Eventually. These things are always a matter of leverage.
Eventually. These things are always a matter of leverage.
And you think O'Brien is that leverage?
And you think O'Brien is that leverage?
That remains to be seen.
And you still believe he's going to come here?
Based on what we know of him, that would seem inevitable.
Based on what we know of him, that would seem inevitable.
Do you think she loves him?
Do you think she loves him?
She must feel something for him. After all, she and I did create him.
Poppy, are you in one of your moods again?
No, Icky, this is real.
You know how I feel about you. You know how much I need you. How much I trust you. I would do anything for you.
Why are there two ottomans?
Why are there two ottomans?
Icarus, please! This is important!
Look at me, Icarus! Look at my body. I've done everything, changed anything you asked me to. 'We will always love most that which we create.' Is that still true?
Yes. Yes, of course it is.
Yes. Yes, of course it is.
Then you still love me?
Then you still love me?
Poppy, please, just tell me what you want.
Icarus?
I promise, my dear, I will give the matter some consideration.
I promise, my dear, I will give the matter some consideration.
Consideration?
Consideration?
If you honestly trust me, then you'll have to trust me.
Can you feel it, Poppy? The presence of the moment? Can you feel the weight of its significance?
Oh yes, Icky. I can feel it.
Oh yes, Icky. I can feel it.
This is what my entire life has been directed at, this moment, this threshold.
This is what my entire life has been directed at, this moment, this threshold.
Okay, arms up, lean forward.
It will be an ascension.
I'm so excited, Icarus.
I was wondering if you'd finished considering?
Considering what?
Considering what?
What I asked you earlier?
Poppy, please --
If you loved me like I loved you?
If you loved me like I loved you?
Poppy, this is not the time!
Did you feel that?
Did I? I've been waiting for that for years.
Did I? I've been waiting for that for years.
Not that.
Okay. Alright. Okey-dokey. Now, we need the nanobot. The nanobot that initiated the reaction. Once we have that we can stabilize the meltdown. Simple really. No problem.
The nanobot is gone.
The fact is, that the milk has been spilled and now we need you to tell us how to clean it up.
Cleaned up? It can't be cleaned up! Without the nanobot the waste can't be stabilized! That's what we've been trying to tell you! The only thing we can do is run! Run! Run!
Facts, Dr. Nebbleman. Facts. You've been using cryogenics to control the waste from the mouse experiment, haven't you?
Well, yes. The replicators are not as active at low temperatures.
Well, yes. The replicators are not as active at low temperatures.
Then perhaps we can use liquid nitrogen to keep the meltdown under control.
Then perhaps we can use liquid nitrogen to keep the meltdown under control.
That might work.
That might work.
Poppy, order the trucks from the Gary plant. And we're going to need a containment crew.
Well, at this time, I mean that is to say, it is difficult to project --
Look, John, nobody wants to find out what happens. That's why you're here. We need your help on this one and that's why that suitcase is here.
She could have given him something to stimulate his kidneys.
Dr. Nebbleman, take care of them.
Where did he go?
The trunk.
They're here! They're here! We have the nanobot.
Excellent. How long until the assembler tank is complete?
Dr. Makeo is working on it now, sir. I estimate at least another six hours.
In the meantime, why don't you find something useful for Dr. Bright to do.
Of course you understand, Dr. Argon, that once the nanobot is inside of you, there is no going back --
Shut up and do it!
Excellent work, Dr. Nebbleman. You have outdone yourself.
Thank you, sir.
It'll be better for us if he simply disappears. The gardener will know what to do.
Wait, wait, can I at least have his body?
Wait, wait, can I at least have his body?
Donated to science. Perfect.
Hey!
You don't want this.
You don't want this.
Yeah, I do!
Yeah, I do!
You have no idea what this is doing to your body.
You have no idea what this is doing to your body.
I like Trix!
Here, kid, this is great stuff. Why don't you give it a try?
I want Trix! Mommy!
Yeah? So what?
So what? So what? For starters, how about littering is a crime.

Haw-haw! Why don't you run off and find a cop and I'll wait right here.
Haw-haw! Why don't you run off and find a cop and I'll wait right here.
Why don't you just put this in your pocket so when you see a garbage can you can put it where it belongs.
Why don't you just put this in your pocket so when you see a garbage can you can put it where it belongs.
Why don't you just shove it up your ass! Haw-haw!
What is it with you litterbugs? Is it a territorial thing, marking your turf with your garbage?
You better quit pushing me, pal.
You better quit pushing me, pal.
I just want to know what goes on in the mind of a litterbug. What chemical is secreted by your smooth brain that tells you, 'It's okay, just chuck it'?

Look, asshole, I don't got time for this. If you got a problem, you better take care of it yourself.
Look, asshole, I don't got time for this. If you got a problem, you better take care of it yourself.
Oh no, no, no. No can do. You enjoyed a tasty beverage and thus this receptacle becomes your responsibility and I don't care if it's a Styrofoam cup or the Exxon Valdez! You've got to learn to take responsibility!
Oh no, no, no. No can do. You enjoyed a tasty beverage and thus this receptacle becomes your responsibility and I don't care if it's a Styrofoam cup or the Exxon Valdez! You've got to learn to take responsibility!
What are you going to do? Make me throw it out?
What are you going to do? Make me throw it out?
I'll do whatever I have to do.
What? Oh, I'm sorry, Nigel. I was just thinking...
Aaabout...?
Aaabout...?
This morning. I saw someone I haven't seen in a long time.
This morning. I saw someone I haven't seen in a long time.
A man?
A man?
Yeah. I knew him when I was still in school.
Yeah. I knew him when I was still in school.
What did he want?
What did he want?
I'm not sure. That's the funny thing about him. He's the kind of guy that you never know what he wants or what he might do to get it.
Do you remember about five years ago, that uh... incident at Purnell Labs?
Oh yeah. They were working on molecular assemblers, too, weren't they?
Oh yeah. They were working on molecular assemblers, too, weren't they?
They also tried using viral R.N.A. as the bonding element.
They also tried using viral R.N.A. as the bonding element.
That's right. C.D.C. found out and closed them down...
Yeah, somebody broke in and stole the samples, one of those animal rights groups, right? I remember now, they freed all the monkeys which caused that huge pileup on the Massachusetts Turnpike, right?
Yeah. But it wasn't a group. It was one man.
Yeah. But it wasn't a group. It was one man.
That's the guy?
What did security say?
They'll in validate the key. Probably nothing.
They'll in validate the key. Probably nothing.
Well, you got another problem.
Well, you got another problem.
The replicators?
The replicators?
Worse. Mrs. Argon wants to talk to you. She's waiting in the lab.
Worse. Mrs. Argon wants to talk to you. She's waiting in the lab.
This day just keeps going from bad to worse.
I bet he hasn't read a single report we've written on the waste problem.
I hope you're right. I'd feel a lot worse if he had read them and just didn't care.
I hope you're right. I'd feel a lot worse if he had read them and just didn't care.
What are you going to do?
What are you going to do?
What I've always done. As long as I'm the only one who can build the nanobot, I'm the only one who can say when it should be tested.
You were never invited to my house.
You're looking for a urine sample.
Of course, sir.
Dr. Argon, I know you want to use the nanobot on yourself, but you mustn't. The situation is critical right now. The replicators are growing exponentially. If we wait much longer it will be too late. You have to use the nanobot to stop the meltdown.
I don't believe this is happening...
Susan, Dr. Argon is giving you an opportunity here.
Susan, Dr. Argon is giving you an opportunity here.
Opportunity?
There's a guard outside my door! I'm a prisoner, Nigel! Do you understand that?
Dr. Argon would say we are all prisoners.
Dr. Argon would say we are all prisoners.
Argon is a lunatic! I can't believe I was stupid enough to believe I could control him. You heard what he said, Nigel. He doesn't care if all of Calumet City is turned to Jell-O. How can that not affect you?
Argon is a lunatic! I can't believe I was stupid enough to believe I could control him. You heard what he said, Nigel. He doesn't care if all of Calumet City is turned to Jell-O. How can that not affect you?
Because I am a new man, Susan. I am a man of vision. Your problem, Susan, is that you're always looking down. If you'd just look up you'd see the big picture and in the big picture men of vision do not dwell on what might be lost. They focus on what can be gained.

Is that what Argon told you?
Is that what Argon told you?
No! Well, not those exact words.
No! Well, not those exact words.
Nigel, can't you see he's using you?
Nigel, can't you see he's using you?
Of course he is, but at least there isn't a security guard outside my door.
Of course he is, but at least there isn't a security guard outside my door.
You're afraid of him.
You're afraid of him.
Who isn't?
I'm a scientist. I have lived my whole life by the diagnostic application of fact and the fact is, Argon is going to get whatever he wants, so if I were you, I'd give it to him.
You mean the designs for the nanobot? You think after this I'm going to give them to him?
You mean the designs for the nanobot? You think after this I'm going to give them to him?
I think that either you're going to give them to him or he's going to make you give them to him.
I think that either you're going to give them to him or he's going to make you give them to him.
Make me? How? You think he's going to torture me?
Yes?
It's Sim. We're almost there.
It's Sim. We're almost there.
Mr. Sim, watch out! O'Brien escaped and could be on his way!
You want to tell me what I'm looking for?
I've only been invited to her house once, but I know there is a basement lab that she uses for private research.
I've only been invited to her house once, but I know there is a basement lab that she uses for private research.
Okay.
What's it smell like?
Smell? Uh, something like methylcyanoacrylate.
Smell? Uh, something like methylcyanoacrylate.
Like Crazy Glue?
Like Crazy Glue?
Yes. That's it. He's got it. Oh God, he's got it!
Sir, please try to hold still.
So, I guess it worked.
He's probably right, sir, the building is probably going to collapse under its own weight.
And if we evacuate, what do you want to do with O'Brien?
Susan!
Wellie well, Dr. Bright. You're just in time.
Daniel...
What? No kiss? Not even for old times sake?
When did you...?
Been out for six months now.
Been out for six months now.
Really? What have you been doing?
Really? What have you been doing?
You know, this and that.
Somebody has to.
Same old Daniel.
Same old Daniel.
Oh no. Not by a long shot. I may look like the old Daniel O'Brien, but on the inside, nothing is the same.
Oh no. Not by a long shot. I may look like the old Daniel O'Brien, but on the inside, nothing is the same.
Is that so?
Is that so?
Oh yeah. See, Susie, a man doesn't do the hard time and just pick up where he left off. Oh no. The big house does things to a man.
Oh yeah. See, Susie, a man doesn't do the hard time and just pick up where he left off. Oh no. The big house does things to a man.
The big house?

The big house.
The big house.
Jesus, Daniel. It wasn't Ryker's Island. It was work camp for white collar criminals.
Jesus, Daniel. It wasn't Ryker's Island. It was work camp for white collar criminals.
A cage by any other name would still smell like sweaty ugly men.
I've been thinking about you a lot all these years, locked up in my cell. I'd tear through every issue of the Midwest Science Journal looking for your latest findings, watching as you slowly worked your polymerization experiments up through single celled organisms to that holiest of holies, the fruit fly. Exciting stuff. I got to tell you, it really kept me going.
I guess I should be flattered.
I guess I should be flattered.
I remember you said, nanotechnology was going to change the world.

It already is.

I've read they're using it to repair cancer cells.

And for cleaning up oil spills.
And for cleaning up oil spills.
Right. You predicted it.
Do you ever wonder what happened to us, Susie?
It was a long time ago, Daniel. We were young, different people, heading in different directions. That's all.
Yeah.
Well, it was good to see you, Daniel, but I have to be going.
Well, it was good to see you, Daniel, but I have to be going.
Sure. Can I ask you one more thing? You haven't published anything in a while. How come?
Nothing really worthwhile.
That's what I thought.
And what I love about molecular science is the way it revolutionizes how we have to think. It unifies the entire world on a single level. Everything is completely connected. Sometimes I can really feel it, everything around us, just a small part of a whole. It's really wonderful.
Yeah, we'll see.
Yeah, we'll see.
We'll see? What does that mean?
We'll see? What does that mean?
We'll see how wonderful it is after you spend the next twenty years making Agent Orange.
We'll see how wonderful it is after you spend the next twenty years making Agent Orange.
God, Daniel, I'm not going to make Agent Orange.
God, Daniel, I'm not going to make Agent Orange.
You think the chemists that invented Agent Orange twenty years ago were in school saying, 'Boy, I really got some good ideas for a highly toxic incendiary defoliant.' You think Oppenheimer was dreaming about mushroom clouds before the war?
We've had this conversation already, Daniel.
All I'm saying is that the companies that have money for the kind of research you're interested in, have money because that's what they're interested in! Money!
I'm sorry I brought the whole thing up! If you're gonna flip your wig --
I can't help it, Suze. It's this place. You know how I get in these stores. They freak me out. All these tiny boxes, little cans filled with eight syllable God knows what.
You think it's a coincidence that they have all these aisles lined up like this, like a little maze! We're all lab rats running through their maze, pulling lever A or lever B, each designed to create some kind of bio-chemical dependency. All the while they're everywhere, watching us, two-way mirrors, surveillance cameras, nodding to each other, making little notes.
You're insane.
You're insane.
Am I? Look! Right there! That's exactly what I am talking about.
Daniel, give him the Trix.
Susan, this is the future of America here.
Susie! You gotta help me!
Daniel, what are you doing here?
Daniel, what are you doing here?
Please, Susan! I need help! Something is wrong with me!
Please, Susan! I need help! Something is wrong with me!
Sorry, Daniel, I'm a physicist, not a psychiatrist.
Sorry, Daniel, I'm a physicist, not a psychiatrist.
No, something is really wrong... look!
They did it to me!
The nanobot.
... just like the mouse.
Mouse? What mouse?
Mouse? What mouse?
My first organic-polymerization was a lab mouse.
My first organic-polymerization was a lab mouse.
What happened to it?
What happened to it?
I don't know.
You don't know?
It escaped from the lab before we could finish the experiment.
It escaped from the lab before we could finish the experiment.
But you've polymerized single-celled bacteria and the fruit flies, I know you have.
But you've polymerized single-celled bacteria and the fruit flies, I know you have.
Yes.
Yes.
Then you must have at some point tried to reverse the procedure.
Oh no, no, no! You've got to be able to fix me! Please, Susan, tell me you can make me normal again!
Once the subject was polymerized we were unable to reassemble the original organic structure.
Oh God, please! This can't be happening! I can't be plastic! A plastic man?!
Daniel!
Daniel!
I'm a plastic man! A plastic man!
We don't have time for hysterics.
We don't?
We don't?
What has happened to you is nothing compared to what is going to happen to Calumet City if we don't hurry.
What are these?
Mostly caffeine diuretics. Help you go to the bathroom.
Mostly caffeine diuretics. Help you go to the bathroom.
Why?
Why?
The nanobot is still inside you. It's programmed to exit through the urinary tract. We need it as soon as possible, so swallow those.
Pills... you know how I feel about pills.
If you don't want to do it this way, I can remove it surgically.
Why do we need it?
The nanobot is the only thing that can stabilize the waste.
The nanobot is the only thing that can stabilize the waste.
What waste?
To put is simply, the nanobot inside you is a microscopic machine encoded with information like a strand of messenger R.N.A. that is programmed to synthesize your molecules with the polyisoprenes of the assembler fluid, rebuilding your entire organic system on a molecular level.
That was 'simple'?
The nanobot combined your molecules with the plastic molecules in the white assembler fluid, so that on a molecular level you now have more in common with a Good Year tire than a human being.
Got it.
Got it.
The problem is the by-product created by the process.
The problem is the by-product created by the process.
The waste.
The replicators start off like assemblers, but the replicators never stabilize.
What happens?
That was an egg?
Three days ago it was.
Three days ago it was.
What do these replicators do to people?
What do these replicators do to people?
With enough exposure, the same thing they do to everything else.
So right now there's little replicators spreading throughout Argon's lab?
That's right.
That's right.
Isn't it already too late then?
I think while we're waiting, we had better run some basic diagnostics on you.
You're the doctor.
Lungs sound fine. You didn't have any pre-existing physical conditions, did you? Allergies? Infections?
No, why?
Is something wrong?
No, no, I just feel wired!
Susan!
What? What's wrong?
Look at this!
What about it!
Just look at it!
The polymerization probably synthesized into a kind of methyl- cyanoacrylate. So what's wrong?
Oh yeah, real funny. Yuk-yuk. Let's laugh at everything a man believes in.
I'm sorry, Daniel, but you have to admit it's pretty ironic that you of all people would be the first man ever polymerized. It's got to mean something.
I'm sorry, Daniel, but you have to admit it's pretty ironic that you of all people would be the first man ever polymerized. It's got to mean something.
Means? Oh no. We won't know what it means until the end of the story and maybe then it won't seem quite as funny to you, Doctor Frankenstein!
What's that supposed to mean?
Just giving credit where credit is due.
Just giving credit where credit is due.
You have no one to blame but yourself.
You have no one to blame but yourself.
Blame the victim.

Victim my ass! You stole my security key and used it to break into my lab to do who knows what kind of damage! Maybe this is the end of the story and you finally got what you deserved!
Victim my ass! You stole my security key and used it to break into my lab to do who knows what kind of damage! Maybe this is the end of the story and you finally got what you deserved!

Come on, I don't see you living in a cave!
Come on, I don't see you living in a cave!
And I don't see you sunbathing at Chernobyl!
Just like old times.
Yeah. Old times.
I want you to know that I really appreciate you helping me.
I'm glad you came to me for help.
I feel very emotional right now. A bit out of control.
Probably the caffeine.
Probably the caffeine.
Do you have something to bring me down?
Do you have something to bring me down?
No problem.
Uh oh. I remember that temper.
Daniel, I didn't hear you come down...
What's wrong?
The nanobot... it's not here...
The nanobot... it's not here...
It's still inside me?
How far can you stretch?
I don't know.
I'm going to go out for a while. I want to take the blood samples to a lab that has the equipment I need.
What did you want my hair for?
What did you want my hair for?
Something else I want to try.
I could go with you.
I think it would be better for me to go alone. I'm sure Sim is looking for you. Just sit tight. I'll bring you back a pizza.
I think it would be better for me to go alone. I'm sure Sim is looking for you. Just sit tight. I'll bring you back a pizza.
No cheese.
No cheese.
I was hoping you were over that. Remember to keep drinking fluids.
That's pretty good.
Getting used to it.
What's that?
It's a crime fighting costume, what do you think? It's underwear, so if you lose your clothes you'll still be decent.
It's a crime fighting costume, what do you think? It's underwear, so if you lose your clothes you'll still be decent.
That's going to fit me?
That's going to fit me?
Like a glove.
You made this out of my hair?
Sort of. We used a process similar to the vulcanization of rubber and added bulk with a chain of chloroprene elastomers.
Did you go?
On the counter.
Who is he?
The head shrinker at the prison.
Oh no. They're trying to blame you for the accident. That means they must not have been able to control the replicators.
I can't go back to jail. I gotta get out of here.
I can't go back to jail. I gotta get out of here.
You're not going back to jail. All we need to do is find the nanobot. Once the meltdown is under control, then we deal with Argon --
I don't believe it. You're here! Oh thank God.
You didn't think I could just leave you?
You didn't think I could just leave you?
I didn't know what was going to happen. I was just so worried something was going to happen to you.
I didn't know what was going to happen. I was just so worried something was going to happen to you.
What could happen? I'm the plastic man, remember?
Oh no! Argon! We have to stop him before he uses the nanobot! We have to get the nanobot!
Where is it?
Where is it?
Argon's private lab.
Argon's private lab.
Let's go.
Run, Daniel! Get out of here!
I'm not leaving without you, Susan!
You saved my life.
Did you think I could just leave you...?
Susie... I...
You don't have to say anything, Daniel. I'm a scientist. I know what's happening. I recognize the classic symptoms. Dizziness, shortness of breath, sweating palms... I can feel my adrenals secreting, my parasympathetic nervous system quivering, the estradiol coursing through my entire body...
What in the...?
Oh shit, the meltdown. It's spread to the tower.
Oh shit, the meltdown. It's spread to the tower.
We've got to get the nanobot.
We've got to get the nanobot.
It's too late. Argon injected it.
It's too late. Argon injected it.
You mean he's polymerized, like me?
That means the nanobot is still inside him.
Yes.
Yes.
What would happen if I threw him into the core?
What would happen if I threw him into the core?
The same thing I suppose.
Daniel, just forget Argon. Let's get out of here. We'll find another way to stop the waste.
We don't have time to argue, Susan.
You're not going after Argon!
I have to!
I have to!
Do the words 'hero fantasies' mean anything to you? How about 'infantile dementia'?
God, when we were in that store all I could think about was that one time, when we were in school, and you attacked that little kid who wanted some cereal. Do you remember that?
I remember I was trying to help...
I remember I was trying to help...
God, what a fight that was.
God, what a fight that was.
We were different people then.
We were different people then.
Do you suppose that was our problem? We met before our time? I think that happens a lot. People, events, planets all just circling each other waiting for that moment when everything clicks into place.
Things do change.
I guess they do.
You! I remember you!
I'm real touched. Now get your Sunday's on. We're going for a ride.
What? I'm not going anywhere!
Oh yes you are!
Oh yes you are!
I get it. You're the goon fetch boy. The zookeeper Argon calls in when one of his guinea pigs gets loose.
I get it. You're the goon fetch boy. The zookeeper Argon calls in when one of his guinea pigs gets loose.
That's right.
Only this ain't no tranquilizer gun. Now let's go!
Forget it, pissboy! You tell Argon he can call my lawyer.
This is wonderfully accommodating of you all. Now I won't have to come looking for you.
You were looking for us?
You were looking for us?
Yeah, I have something I've been meaning to give you.
Yeah, I have something I've been meaning to give you.
Yeah, and what might that be?
Yeah, and what might that be?
An ass-beating. Would you like yours first, Mr. Sim?
All the different ways that I could kill you.
Oh yeah?
Maybe you're ready to find out if that hide of yours is bulletproof?
The question is, are you?
That's impossible.
It's a miracle.
Mrs. Argon? It's Sim.
Mr. Sim? Do you have him? He's alive?
Mr. Sim? Do you have him? He's alive?
Oh yeah, he's alive. Technically.
Oh yeah, he's alive. Technically.
And you have him?
And you have him?
We lost him.
Vermin...
Can I help you, Mrs. Argon?
I spoke to Dr. Argon this morning and he remains frustrated over the loss of the original nanobot.
I am aware of Dr. Argon's frustrations.
I am aware of Dr. Argon's frustrations.
He believes that the second nanobot should be ready for testing by now.
Under the circumstances, I can't fathom what makes Dr. Argon think we are ready for anything bigger. If C.N.N., or hell, if the E.P.A. knew what was in my basement --
Is that a threat, Dr. Bright?
Is that a threat, Dr. Bright?
Look, as I have said and will continue to say, the instability of the assembler waste remains my priority --
Look, as I have said and will continue to say, the instability of the assembler waste remains my priority --
While you remain on the staff at Argon Laboratories, your priorities will always be the same as Dr. Argon's priorities. I imagine that is a simple enough equation for a bright girl like you to figure out.
If you don't have any questions, I'll let you get back to doing your job.
Just one question. Since Dr. Argon no longer has feeling below his waist, how is it that you're still able to do your job?
I could have you fired right now.
You won't. That's why you're whispering.
Icky!
Get him, Daniel! Knock his block off!
Okay, Barbie, let's get this over with.
Don't worry, four eyes.
It might be paranoia, but I've never lost my keycard before.
'Paranoia is what separates the secured from the unsecured.'
If this nutcase did take it and has half a brain, he'd use it right away, before we could invalidate it.
Yes, that is what I was thinking.
Yes, that is what I was thinking.
In fact, would it be safe to say, based on your general knowledge of this character, that he is already in the building?
In fact, would it be safe to say, based on your general knowledge of this character, that he is already in the building?
Yes, he might be.
What in the hell?
Pipe down, brain lady! And you...
Oh, Stew and I went for a long ride. Dexter, is there any finishing school we can send him to?
Yes - Sing Sing.
Yes, it'll be a very interesting experiment.
To make a gentleman out of a tramp?
To make a gentleman out of a tramp?
Exactly.
Exactly.
Now, Anne, you remember how much it cost to get rid of that baseball player?
Now, Anne, you remember how much it cost to get rid of that baseball player?
You don't seem to understand that this one's different. He has brains.
Well, what else do you expect them to call you?
Dexter.
Indeed? How interesting.
Yes - isn't it.
Miss Wilson will give you the guest list and any other details you may need, Miss Gallagher.
Thank you. I'll go and look for her at once. Goodbye, Mrs. Smith.
Thank you. I'll go and look for her at once. Goodbye, Mrs. Smith.
Goodbye, Miss Gallagher.
Goodbye, Miss Gallagher.
Goodbye, Stew
I think I better go, Stew.
I think you should, Miss Gallagher.
Don't mind Mother.
I don't mind her if you don't.
I'm sure you're quite willing to be decent about this.
Decent? Why Miss Schuyler, I want to be noble.
You're not going to print this silly thing, are you?
No? Why not?
You know something, lady, if you sold life insurance, I'd go for a policy in sixty seconds.
Oh, thank you, I knew you'd understand.
May I use your telephone?
Certainly. Right over there.
Certainly. Right over there.
You're all right.
That's a good idea - telephone the police. The number is Spring 3100. Get a couple of cops over and we can have a rubber of bridge.
You may go, Smythe.
What do you want?
Well, I tell you, yesterday when I was here, I had one of your books in my hand, and when I got outside, I realized I still had your book in my hand. So as long as I had your book in my hand, I thought I might as well take it home and read it. This morning, I got up and put your
That's considerate of you.
Yeah, that was considerate of me. I recommend you read it.
Yeah, that was considerate of me. I recommend you read it.
I'm not interested in your literary recommendations.
I'm not interested in your literary recommendations.
Well, maybe it's a bit heavy for you. Perhaps if you'd like something lighter - something with a touch of romance
Just listen to this Adorable Babykins Does her miss her Baby? Him sends his booful li'l sweetums a billion oceans full of kisses. Bobo is so lonely!
Just a moment. I don't see how that trash could possibly concern me.
Ah! But you don't know who Bobo is. And you don't know who Babykins is.
I'm not interested. Smythe will open the door.
Where did you get those letters?
I stole them when I was interviewing Babykins about Bobo.
I suppose you're going to print them?
No - give you another guess.
Oh, I don't need another guess. It's quite obvious.
So, it's obvious, huh?
Will you step into the library?
Sure, I'll take a chance.
Will - uh - five thousand be enough?
For what?
For what?
For the letters, of course.
I don't know how to thank you. Mother'll be so grateful - she'll probably want to kiss you.
Your mother will want to kiss me? Give me back my letters. That's the breaks I get. It's the mothers that are always grateful to me. Here.
Your mother will want to kiss me? Give me back my letters. That's the breaks I get. It's the mothers that are always grateful to me. Here.
You're a peculiar person. Why the other day I pleaded with you not to send in that story and 
You're a peculiar person. Why the other day I pleaded with you not to send in that story and 
I know but that was news. This is blackmail and I don't like blackmail.
won't even pretend it isn't a very great favor. I wish there was something I could do for you
Well, you could make this table a little - uh - a little less wide. There is something you can do for me, Miss Schuyler.
Really?
Yeah, I haven't figured out the plot yet, but it's laid in a Siberian village.

Me? No - most ordinary guy in the world, me. Only one thing wrong with me

You don't wear garters!
I'm just beginning to believe that something could be done with you.
Say, you could do anything with me you wanted to. Putty - just putty, that's me. Now getting back to those eyes of yours - would you mind if I kind of got closer so I could see them?

Not if you're going to lose any sleep about it.
Oh, Mother!
It's all right. It's all right, Anne. I can take a hint. A bit subtle, but I get it. It's all right.
It's all right. It's all right, Anne. I can take a hint. A bit subtle, but I get it. It's all right.
Please go. I'll explain to Mother.
Hello, Natalie. Mr. Stewart Smith . . . Miss Montgomery, Mrs. Eames, Mrs. Radcliff, Mr. Radcliff
How-di-do.
Why should I? We're happy, aren't we, darling?
Throw me out - because I'm beginning to get goofy ideas, and they concern you, Anne.
Throw me out - because I'm beginning to get goofy ideas, and they concern you, Anne.
None of your ideas can be goofy, Stew, if they concern me.
None of your ideas can be goofy, Stew, if they concern me.
My name is Smith - well, that you seem to have been able to stand for the last month. I'm white, male and over twenty-one. I've never been in jail - that is, not often. And I prefer Scotch to Bourbon. I hate carrots, I hate peas, I like black coffee and I hate garters. I make seventy-five bucks a week and I've got

And I prefer Scotch to Bourbon. I hate carrots, I hate peas, I like black coffee and I hate garters. I make seventy-five bucks a week and I've got
That's because you're too far away, Stew.
Now Mother, your attitude is perfectly ridiculous. It's done now. Stewart and I are married.
I'm afraid she's right, Mrs. Schuyler. I'm really very sorry, Mrs. Schuyler, that you feel this way. I was in hopes that you would like me. I'm not the burglar that you think I am. After all, we're married. I think the thing to do is to kiss and make up - Mother.
A little? Sure, I'll be right up. He's all right. I like him.
I'm glad.
What's the matter? Something I et, no doubt. Egg marks the spot
You ought to get some new ties, Stewart.
You ought to get some new ties, Stewart.
I don't need any new ties. I've got another tie - I've got another one besides this one. And it's a pip, too. There's only one thing wrong with it. You know what that is? It has a little weakness for gravy, and once in a while it leans a little toward ketchup. Of course that's only in its weaker moments. When you move
Your place?
Yeah. Oh, it's great. Of course it doesn't compare with this coliseum of yours here, but 'twill serve m'lady, 'twill serve. The architecture has a little feeling of Missouri Gothic - and the furniture sort of leans toward Oklahoma Renaissance - with a tiny touch of Grand Rapids.

Don't you think it's silly of us to think of living there when we have this whole big house
Don't you think it's silly of us to think of living there when we have this whole big house
When 'we' . . .? You mean, you'd like to have me live here in your house?
We could have the whole left wing? Wouldn't that be nice! Would that be room enough for us?
Oh darling, of course it would. If it isn't - there are six rooms and two baths - but if that isn't enough, Mother will give us the blue room too, I think.
Oh darling, of course it would. If it isn't - there are six rooms and two baths - but if that isn't enough, Mother will give us the blue room too, I think.
Oh, Mother will give us the blue room. You haven't a red room, have you? Well, bless her heart. Wouldn't that be nice! My, oh my - six rooms and two baths and a blue room. I guess she would let us have the right wing if we needed it, wouldn't she?
Oh, Mother will give us the blue room. You haven't a red room, have you? Well, bless her heart. Wouldn't that be nice! My, oh my - six rooms and two baths and a blue room. I guess she would let us have the right wing if we needed it, wouldn't she?
But we don't need it, I'm sure.
But we don't need it, I'm sure.
I see, we won't need that. Plenty of room, plenty of room.
Look Anne, you're not serious about this, are you?
Of course I am Stewart.
Of course I am Stewart.
Now let's get this settled
You have the cutest nose I've
Never mind my nose. What kind of a chump do you think I am? You think I'm going to live here in your house - on your dough? What do you think my friends would all say? Don't be silly. I'd get the razzing of my life for that. 'A bird in a gilded cage' - that's what I'd be. Not me. Oh no,

What do you think my friends would say if they found me in a little cheap flat?
What do you think my friends would say if they found me in a little cheap flat?
It isn't cheap. It's nice.
It isn't cheap. It's nice.
Listen Stew baby, let's not talk about things like that now
Listen Stew baby, let's not talk about things like that now
Wait a minute. I'll do anything you ask me, Anne, but I will not live
Wait a minute. I'll do anything you ask me, Anne, but I will not live
Oh, I love that nose. It's such a sweet nose.
I've got a present. Shut your eyes. Keep 'em closed. I know you're going to love them.
Little - couldn't be an automobile, could it? Well, well! Ain't that nice!
Do you like them?
Got my initials on them too. They're cute. They're nice little things - what do you do with them?
Got my initials on them too. They're cute. They're nice little things - what do you do with them?
You wear them of course, silly.
You wear them of course, silly.
Oh no. No, no. Not me. I haven't worn these things for Years.
Oh no. No, no. Not me. I haven't worn these things for Years.
I know that.
I know that.
Besides I'd look foolish. I couldn't look Gallagher in the face.
Besides I'd look foolish. I couldn't look Gallagher in the face.
Darling, I don't care whether you can look Gallagher in the face or not, but you're gonna be a good boy and wear garters.
Darling, I don't care whether you can look Gallagher in the face or not, but you're gonna be a good boy and wear garters.
Honey, I love you. I'll eat spinach for you. I'll go to the dentist twice a year for you. I'll wash behind my ears for you. But I will never wear garters!
Oh, yes you will my dear - oh, yes you will my dear - you'll wear garters and you'll like it too!
Oh, no I won't my dear - oh, no I won't my dear - I'll wash behind my ears, but no I won't my dear!
Oh, yes you will my dear - oh, yes you will my dear - you'll eat spinach but you'll wear garters too!
Oh, you can't carry a tune - you can't carry a tune - all you are good for is to sit and spoon, spoon. Oh no, I won't wear garters
Oh, you can't carry a tune - you can't carry a tune - all you are good for is to sit and spoon, spoon. Oh no, I won't wear garters
Oh yes you will wear garters
Anne, prepare yourself for the treat of your life. This is Gallagher.
Gallagher!
Gallagher!
Sure - my pal on the paper. She's subbing for the society editor tonight.
Oh, yes, of course. How do you do?
Gallagher, this is Mrs. Smith.
You know, Stewart, you failed to mention that Miss Gallagher was a very beautiful young girl.
Gallagher?
Yes. As a matter of fact, you failed to mention that Gallagher was a girl.
Didn't I? That's funny. Isn't it funny?
Didn't I? That's funny. Isn't it funny?
Yes - isn't it?
No? What do you look upon her as?
Why, down at the office, we always look at Gallagher as - eh - just Gallagher, that's all.
That was kind of a rotten thing to do, Anne. After all, Gallagher is my friend. The least you can do is be courteous to her.
I thought I was very charming, Stewart.
I thought I was very charming, Stewart.
You did? That's a lot of hooey! I'll go and apologize.
Is this true, Stewart? Did you really say it?
Yes, I said it. Sure, I said it. I didn't say it for publication, however.
Stewart! We're all waiting for you. Where's your valet?
I poisoned him.
I poisoned him.
Stop trying to be funny, and get ready, will you?
I'm not going!
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about - I'm not going out.
I'm talking about - I'm not going out.
What am I going downstairs and tell those people?
What am I going downstairs and tell those people?
Go downstairs, and tell them - anything. Tell them I'm not going. Tell them I'm not home.
Go downstairs, and tell them - anything. Tell them I'm not going. Tell them I'm not home.
Stewart, would you mind telling me why you're not going?
Stewart, would you mind telling me why you're not going?
Yes, I'll tell you - for the same reason I've never wanted to go out with those social parasites, those sweet-smelling fashion plates. I don't like them. They bore me. They give me the jitters.
Anne, come here. Listen
Look out for my lipstick, Stewart.
Look out for my lipstick, Stewart.
I'll tell you what. Let's you and me sneak out all by ourselves
I'll tell you what. Let's you and me sneak out all by ourselves
Are you crazy?
Are you crazy?
Think of the fun we can have - we'll sneak down the back stairs and get in the valet's Ford. How's that?

Will you stop being silly, Stewart?
Will you stop being silly, Stewart?
I'll tell you what let's do - I'll take you and introduce you to all my gang. Would you like that?
I'll tell you what let's do - I'll take you and introduce you to all my gang. Would you like that?
But I don't want to meet your gang.
But I don't want to meet your gang.
I don't mean the newspaper fellows that you don't like. Another gang I know - you'd love them. They're writers and musicians and artists - a great crowd of people - people who do great things. People who are worthwhile.
I don't mean the newspaper fellows that you don't like. Another gang I know - you'd love them. They're writers and musicians and artists - a great crowd of people - people who do great things. People who are worthwhile.
Meaning, my friends aren't worthwhile, I suppose?
Meaning, my friends aren't worthwhile, I suppose?
Oh, they're all right, Anne. But I
Oh, they're all right, Anne. But I
That's exactly what you mean. Heaven knows you've made that clear to me often enough. Well, I'm sick and tired of it. I've given you party after party - I've taken you to some of the best houses in this town - and introduced you to people of importance - and are you grateful? No! You insult them and act like a bore. I'm
Oh hello, Anne He types furiously.
Good morning. What does this mean?
Oh, that mob downstairs. I guess I got so interested in the play I forgot all about them.
I see.
I see.
Have we got a play, Anne? Oh, have we got a play! Of course most of it is Gallagher's. She did most of it. That brain of hers just snaps like that all the time.
What's the idea, Anne?
The idea is simply this - that I want those people to leave here immediately.

Now wait a minute. Aren't you being a little unreasonable?
Now wait a minute. Aren't you being a little unreasonable?
Unreasonable! Have you any idea what the place looks like downstairs? Do you expect me to stand here and see this place turned into a cheap barroom?
Unreasonable! Have you any idea what the place looks like downstairs? Do you expect me to stand here and see this place turned into a cheap barroom?
Now wait, don't get excited, Anne. There's no reason for that. Perhaps the boys have had a little too much to drink. That's all right. I'm sorry. I'll go right down and throw them out. That's no reason for you to take this attitude. After all, I certainly have a right to invite a few of my friends to my house, haven't I?

Your house?
Your house?
O-o-oh, I get you All right. All right. I don't blame you. I kinda forgot myself for a moment, there. That's what I call getting me told, isn't it, Anne?
and if it's all the same to you, I'm moving out.
Stewart!
Stewart!
This is something I should have done a long time ago, only I didn't have sense enough to do it. No, I had to stick around here to try and make a success of something that I knew darn well was a failure from the very beginning. But no more. No more! So that's that.

You can't walk out of here like this.
You've done nothing but watch me - watch me! - ever since I've been here. Treated me like a thug, watched me like a hawk, mistrusted me. Every time I leave the house, that Jane goes out and counts the silverware.
That's ridiculous.
That's ridiculous.
Fine! I don't blame her. I know I'm out of my own crowd. I should have had better sense in the beginning. But I'll stay in my own backyard from now on.

You're acting like a child.
You're acting like a child.
All right, I'm a child. Have it any way you want. But I'm going back to my own apartment, where I should have lived in the first place. But no, I got to listen to you and move here. All right. If you want to live with me, Anne, okay. But the sign outside will say "Mr. Stew Smith" and you'll have to be
You should have known better than to write, Romeo. I found that out a long time ago.
I should say you had. At the rate you two are going, we'll have to leave the country to save our faces.

Splendid, Mother. Let's hop over to Monte Carlo. It's a great place to save a face.
Splendid, Mother. Let's hop over to Monte Carlo. It's a great place to save a face.
Oh, shut up!
That's an excellent idea.
Oh, hello Mother!
What is this person doing here?
Why
It's a good thing your father passed away before he saw insanity ravage the family. I can't imagine what made you do such a thing. A reporter! Of all things, a reporter! A barbarian who lets his socks come down!
Mother, I promise you that he won't be a reporter much longer. Once I get him away from that atmosphere and get him away from a man named Gallagher
Mother, I promise you that he won't be a reporter much longer. Once I get him away from that atmosphere and get him away from a man named Gallagher
Sit down!
Good morning, Mother. Didn't I tell you that he'd be marvelous. Everybody thought he was so charming last night.
I was so worried for fear he'd knock over a vase or something. I must have acted like an idiot. What does it say about the reception last night?

Oh, the usual thing. Blah, blah, blah attended the blah, blah reception and wore the same blah, blah things.

Stop it. Anne. You're behaving like the person you're married to.
Stop it. Anne. You're behaving like the person you're married to.
You don't have anything to complain about, Mother. He was all right last night, wasn't he? I told you not to worry about him.
You don't have anything to complain about, Mother. He was all right last night, wasn't he? I told you not to worry about him.
It was a miracle. The man was ill or something.
Ah-ah-ah!
Mother!
Mother!
Look! Look! The front page!
Why doesn't Dexter show some decency? And you might show some too, Mother. What do you expect a man to do when he's called such names? I'm glad you hit that reporter, Stewart. He deserved it.
All right, all right! It's your funeral, Anne Schuyler!
Hello, there, Meadows![13]
Who is it you wish to see, sir?
Who is it you wish to see, sir?
I want to see Stew Smith. Oh excuse me - I mean Mr. Smith.

Pardon me, Mr. Smith is engaged. We are having a reception here this evening
Pardon me, Mr. Smith is engaged. We are having a reception here this evening
Oh, a party! Great, great! Jolly times and merry pranks. That's me. I'm a guy who loves parties. You know
a beautiful pair of shoulders! But listen now, as a favor, will you please make it snappy, Laughing Waters,[14] and tell Stew Smith I gotta see him because if you don't my whole family's going to die.
I'll tell Mr. Smith at once, sir. Have a seat.
I'll tell Mr. Smith at once, sir. Have a seat.
Well, I got a seat, but I have no place to put it.
What's the matter? Isn't there a 'bless you' in the crowd?
You're the Tribune man?
You're the Tribune man?
Yeah, hello. How are you?
Fine. Have a seat.
Thanks, I will.
This way.
Oh, man!
Fine newspaper the Tribune.
Well, I should say!

I knew your managing editor very well.

Is that so?

Huh?
Huh?
We were classmates.
I got him his job on the paper. I'm a stock-holder, you know.
Is that so?
Is that so?
As one Tribune man to another
Yeah!
But right now I'm acting in the capacity of Mrs. Schuyler's attorney.

Oh yeah?
So, you see how silly that rumor is?
Why, sure. It's a lotta hooey.
Why, sure. It's a lotta hooey.
That's what I wanted to say, but I couldn't think of it.
Thank you very much.
All right, all right, don't mention it.
All right, all right, don't mention it.
Give my regards to your managing editor.
Give my regards to your managing editor.
I certainly will.
Say, take it easy! Take it easy! Listen, my boy. No use you hanging around here. Just buy the Tribune tonight and read all about it. You can rewrite it for your last edition.
Couldn't make the last edition. It'd take me four hours to translate your story into English.
Couldn't make the last edition. It'd take me four hours to translate your story into English.
Oh, is that so?
Oh, is that so?
I'm afraid.
Impossible. Put it on again.
Hey, make up your mind, will you?
What do you want?
Oh, nothing. I just blew over - I wanted to see how the old newshound looked made up for a gentleman.
Oh, nothing. I just blew over - I wanted to see how the old newshound looked made up for a gentleman.
Would you like to have me turn around for you, Bingy?

Oh boy, I'd love it.
How's that?
Not bad - not good - but not bad. You ought to be able to fool about almost anybody.

Now get this mug. You've got the kind of chin I just love to touch. And if you don't get out of here, I'm going to hang one right on it.
I bring a message from Garcia.
Yeah?
Yeah?
Yeah. The boss sent me over to offer you a job. He wants you to write a daily column on the Tribune.

I'll bite. What's the catch?
I'll bite. What's the catch?
There's no catch. This is on the up and up. Of course all you have to do is just sign the article - by Anne Schuyler's Husband.
Is there a green elephant standing beside that bwana?
No, it's just little Bingy Baker.
Big Chief Bingy come to white man's tepee to make friends. Big Chief very sorry. To show how sorry - will bend over and let white man kick Big Chief where sun never shines.
Excuse me, Gallagher. I wouldn't miss this one for the world.
Well, Stew, that's all thrashed out. By golly, I'm surely glad to see that you're not really sore. You know our racket - after all, news is news.
Sure, sure. That's all right. That was a great story, Bingy. A great story - wish I'd printed it.
Sure, sure. That's all right. That was a great story, Bingy. A great story - wish I'd printed it.
I gave you the breaks, didn't I? That hairy chest story!
I gave you the breaks, didn't I? That hairy chest story!
You've raised it up to the chin, I see. Go on in the other room and get yourself a drink.
Look, I quit!
Yeah?
Yeah?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah?
Yeah?
You're always picking on me. It took me three hours to get those little gadgets in those holes, and you screw it up in a minute. Hey, look!
Aagh! No wonder you're batty. Would it be imposing too much upon you if I asked you to do a little work today? Just to sort of break the monotony?
With me you can always do business.
With me you can always do business.
Do you know what to do in a drawing- room?

Now listen, we've got a tip that the Schuyler family has finally made a deal with that chorus dame.
Gloria Golden?

Yeah, little Gloria.

Get going where? I can write that yarn without stepping out of the office.
Get going where? I can write that yarn without stepping out of the office.
Yeah - and get us into a million dollar libel suit. It wouldn't be the first time. Now, you get over there and get a statement out of the old lady, the sister, or the kid. Any of them - but get it.

All right. Give me a voucher for expenses.
All right. Give me a voucher for expenses.
What expenses? All you need is carfare to Long Island. You'd better get a shave and a shine, because you, you're going to have a tough time getting in there as it is.

I know those bluenoses. Their ancestors refused to come over on the Mayflower because they didn't want to rub elbows with the tourists. So they swam over.
Now listen boss, if you're going to kick about that expense account
Do you call yourself a reporter?
It has been alleged - yes
You wouldn't know news if you fell into a mess of it, nose first. So you're the bright lad that's never been scooped!

Not on my own beat, no.
Not on my own beat, no.
No? Well, where were you when that happened?
I've heard of people being scooped on their own funerals, but this! Holy mackerel! Why, it's news when Anne Schuyler gets her fingernails manicured, but this! She gets married to one of our own reporters and the Tribune beat us to it! Well! What do you guys want? Go on, get back to your desks. Go back to your work. Now don't tell me
No, no - it's true, all right, only we didn't want to get it in print yet, that's all.
No, no - it's true, all right, only we didn't want to get it in print yet, that's all.
Why not?
Why not?
Well, you see, I've acquired one of those new mother-in-laws, and we were afraid she wouldn't understand the whole idea. So we were going to wait till she went to Europe.
Well, you see, I've acquired one of those new mother-in-laws, and we were afraid she wouldn't understand the whole idea. So we were going to wait till she went to Europe.
What do I care about your mother- in-law! You're still working for this paper, aren't you! Or are you?
What do I care about your mother- in-law! You're still working for this paper, aren't you! Or are you?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Well, it's your business to get news! And here you had a story right in your own lap and you let the Tribune scoop us on it. Making a first class Grade A monkey out of me. If it ever happens again - just don't bother about coming back. That's all.
Gallagher and myself just came over here to do a little work on a story -
Baloney! Joe! Bring me a special!
Well, when are you quitting?
Quitting? I'm not thinking about quitting.
Mr. Schuyler .
Now get this, Conroy. My name is Smith. Always was Smith - and always gonna be Smith.

Just a boid in a gilded cage -
A what?
A what?
You heard me. A bird in a gilded cage.
You heard me. A bird in a gilded cage.
Aw, you've been reading a lot of cheap tabloids. Anne and myself are going to move downtown in a nice little flat, we're gonna forget all about this social stuff, and we're gonna be known as Mr. and Mrs. Stew Smith. How do you like that?

How do you like your bath, sir?
I like my bath all right. How do you like your bath?
Who are you?
I'm your valet, sir. Dawson is the name, sir.

Thank you, thank you, thank you! I'll do that for you some time. That's very sweet. Say listen, what did you say your name was?
Dawson, sir.
Dawson, sir.
Dawson, huh? Was I very drunk last night?
Dawson, huh? Was I very drunk last night?
Drunk, sir?
Yes. I must have been pretty much plastered if I hired a valet.
Oh, but you didn't engage me, sir.
Did you take anything out of those pants?
Oh no, sir!
Oh no, sir!
What are you doing fooling around in here?
What are you doing fooling around in here?
Miss Schuyler - I mean, Mrs. Smith - she engaged me this morning, sir.
Say, you are nice. You're all right. You'd make a good wife.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, sir.
But not for me! Though I like you well enough. You're a nice fellow. You're all right. But I'm sorry I don't need any valleys today.
Are you trying to tell me that I need someone to help me put on my pants and button them up?
Quite so. Quite.
Quite so. Quite.
Now I'm sorry. I appreciate your efforts. But I don't need anybody to help me button my pants - I've been buttoning my pants for thirty years all right, and I can button 'em with one hand as a matter of fact.
Now I'm sorry. I appreciate your efforts. But I don't need anybody to help me button my pants - I've been buttoning my pants for thirty years all right, and I can button 'em with one hand as a matter of fact.
Now Mr. Smith, now please
All right, outside!
I beg your pardon, sir?
I beg your pardon, sir?
Outside!
I think I understand, sir. You mean you want me to go?
There you are. You caught on. You see, you're nice and you're smart too. You caught on right away. Outside! Go on! Outside! And don't come back!
That's a canary, sir.

You newspaper people have a lot of fun with him, don't you? What is it you call him - the Cinderella Man?
Stew, your hands are shaking. You've been drinking again.
Come on, come on. Here they come, Gallagher! Here they come!
The boss is getting hoarse.
There's the third one. If I don't get the last one, there's a certain sob sister I know that's going to get a kick right in the . . . oh! Whoops, almost had that.
You're sure going to be poison to that Junior Leaguer[4] from now on!
I hope not . . . I've got to call on her this morning!
You what?
Sure, I must drop in on the mad wench. Her wounds need soothing.

For heaven's sake, Stew, are you completely bats? What for? I thought the story was cold. You can't go back there.
For heaven's sake, Stew, are you completely bats? What for? I thought the story was cold. You can't go back there.
Sure, the story is cold, but I'm not. I'm sizzling - look! Psst!
And with it came love! Oh Gallagher, you've got to meet her. She's it
and that
and that
and those and them.
Well, I've seen her pictures, and I don't think she's so hot.
Oh, you don't appreciate it. Her pictures don't do her justice. Why, Gallagher, she's queenly - she is queenly - and I know queens! And oh, has she got herself a nose - and I know noses too. That little snozzle of hers is the berries, I tell you. And is she cute when she throws that little snozzle to the high heavens!

Of course I haven't got a nose.
Sure, sure. You've got a nose, Gallagher. You've got a nose. But there's different women, Gallagher. You know, like brewery horses and thoroughbreds.
On now, Stew, don't be too hard on her. I wouldn't call her a brewery horse.

Well!
Well!
Well, you're my pal, aren't you? Then don't turn female on me.
Well, well, well! Gallagher, old pal! There you are. What did you run away for?
I didn't run away.
Sure, you ran away. Aren't you going to congratulate a guy?
Sure. I wish you all the luck in the world, pal.
Thanks, thanks.
I hope you'll be very happy.
Oh sure, we'll be happy. What's the matter with your eyes?
It's the smoke.
It's the smoke.
Joe! A little snifter. Say, wasn't I a lucky guy to fall into a girl like that, huh? Look at that! I don't know how I rate that, Gallagher. Gosh, there's a swell girl. I want you to meet her.

Who me? She wouldn't want to meet me. I'm just an old load of hay.
Ah! Thank you, Joe. Tell you what - we'll have one of those parties down at your house - one of those spaghetti parties, you know. Gee, we haven't had one of those in a long time, have we Gallagher?
Not since you broke into society.
Not since you broke into society.
Remember the time we had a spaghetti party, and while I was serving the spaghetti I dropped it on the floor, and while those mugs weren't looking, I picked it up and served it to them anyway! Remember that? Yes, Anne would love that.
Do you think your wife would walk up three flights of stairs just to eat out of paper plates?
Who - Anne? Sure, Anne would love that.

Remember, she's a Schuyler.

Now get this, Gallagher - Smith. That's the name.

Well, if she doesn't want to come, I'll come down alone.
Well, if she doesn't want to come, I'll come down alone.
Oh no, you won't, Mr. Smith. You're a married man now. Mother always warned me never to run around with married men.
Oh no, you won't, Mr. Smith. You're a married man now. Mother always warned me never to run around with married men.
Say, what kind of a pal are you? You're not going to leave me flat?
Oh, I'll call you up some time. And if your social duties permit - why -
Cut that out. Just because I'm married - there's no reason for that.
Don't pay attention to him, Stew. He doesn't know what he's talking about.
Pay attention? I'm not paying any attention to him. You think that guy could get me upset? Hah! Not that mug. He's a tough mug - hard, cynical. He doesn't know the fine things in life - that guy. A bird in a gilded cage, huh? It's getting so a guy can't step out without being called a magnolia. Stew Smith, a magnolia! Not

Her family? Oh, they'll be all right. I'll bring them around. Gilded cage?! Besides, I'm not marrying her family. Stew Smith in a gilded cage! Stew Smith? Ha! That mug. What does he know?
Mr. Smith, I've read some of your plays and I'd like an autograph.
Well, well! If it isn't my old friend! Turn around, gal! Let's get a look at you.

Well, I'll have to look someplace else.
Well, I'll have to look someplace else.
No, no! Maybe we could interest you in some well done butterflies, or perhaps some slightly fried pansies, or better still, some stuffed shirts. And guaranteed every one of them will give you a good stiff pain in the neck.
No, no! Maybe we could interest you in some well done butterflies, or perhaps some slightly fried pansies, or better still, some stuffed shirts. And guaranteed every one of them will give you a good stiff pain in the neck.
Say, who's been tying your ties lately? It looks rotten.
Gee Gallagher, do you look good! What are you doing to yourself?
Nothing.
Nothing.
What did you do to that hair? And where did you get that dress?
What did you do to that hair? And where did you get that dress?
I dyed one and washed the other.
I dyed one and washed the other.
Oh, you dyed one and washed the other. Well! You certainly look good.
Don't turn around now - but there's a very beautiful girl up there who seems to be staring at us.
Staring at us?
Staring at us?
My mistake - she's glaring.
My mistake - she's glaring.
Must be my wife.
They all consider me just as one of the boys.
Right!
I'm sorry, Gallagher - really, I am sorry.
Oh, that's all right, Stew. Forget it. As far as she's concerned, I'm just part of the hired help.
Oh, that's all right, Stew. Forget it. As far as she's concerned, I'm just part of the hired help.
No, no. Strange, I've never seen Anne act that way before. It's funny I never thought to tell her you were a girl, isn't it?
No, no. Strange, I've never seen Anne act that way before. It's funny I never thought to tell her you were a girl, isn't it?
Yes.
Well, Gallagher! Glad to see you.
Hello, Stew.
Hello, Stew.
Hello, Hank. How are you?
I'm sorry, Stew. I asked Hank, and Hank did the rest.
I see. Hank brought them all. That's all right. We'll give them a drink and throw 'em out. How's that?
I see. Hank brought them all. That's all right. We'll give them a drink and throw 'em out. How's that?
Okay.
Okay.
Smythe! Give them one drink and throw 'em out!
You know what I should do with you? I should sock you right in that funny little nose.
Yes - and I'd love it.
How far have you gotten?
Well, I've just been able to get off that Norway coast - so far.
Well, you're not getting your play done, but you're certainly covering a lot of territory.
Haven't I covered some territory? It feels like I've been on a Cook's Tour[18] some place.
Stewart, have you ever been to Old Madrid?
Been where?
Been where?
To Old Madrid.
To Old Madrid.
Never even been to New Madrid.
Never even been to New Madrid.
Then how do you expect to write about it?

Oh - draw on my imagination, I suppose.

Did Conrad draw on his imagination?
Did who?
Conrad.
Conrad.
What do you know about Conrad?
What do you know about Conrad?
I don't know a thing about him, but isn't he the one you're always yelling about?
Isn't he the one that always writes about things - only the things he knows about?
Right.
Right.
Didn't he go to sea before he wrote about it?
Didn't he go to sea before he wrote about it?
Right.

Then why don't you write about something you know? Write about yourself and Anne. The poor boy who marries a rich girl - now there's a swell theme.

Gee, that's an idea, Gallagher. That's an idea there. I wonder now...
Gee, that's an idea, Gallagher. That's an idea there. I wonder now...
Oh, sure. She'd make a beautiful heroine...
Oh, sure. She'd make a beautiful heroine...
And there's her mother - and what a character that old dame would make with her double-strength - and that lawyer friend of theirs - he'd make a great villain - and there's you!

What could I be?
What could I be?
You could be something. I've got an idea, Gallagher. Let's get this set. That's a great idea for a play. Pal, get me a cigarette, will you?
You could be something. I've got an idea, Gallagher. Let's get this set. That's a great idea for a play. Pal, get me a cigarette, will you?
Here you are.
Here you are.
All right, thanks. Now, let's see. How will I start? Hey pal, how would you start?
Now Gallagher, if we could only get a great scene - a tremendously emotional scene - something that would just wring the hearts out of the public - to bring the curtain down in the second act - that would be okay. Couldn't dig one out of your hat some place, could you?
Nope - afraid I'm all out of tricks tonight.
Nope - afraid I'm all out of tricks tonight.
Now, we've got it right up to where the boy's wearing his white spats and going to teas and the frau enters - how's that?
Now, we've got it right up to where the boy's wearing his white spats and going to teas and the frau enters - how's that?
Very good.
I wouldn't worry too much about it, Stew. She'll see it your way.
Huh? Oh, I'm not worrying about her - I'm worrying about that second act curtain, that's all.
Hey, Gallagher!
Yeah?
Yeah?
How about my breakfast? How do you expect me to ring a curtain down on an empty stomach?
How about my breakfast? How do you expect me to ring a curtain down on an empty stomach?
It'll be ready in a minute.
It'll be ready in a minute.
Never mind that. If you can't get my breakfast ready - and can't get here on time in the morning - then you can go get yourself another job.
Never mind that. If you can't get my breakfast ready - and can't get here on time in the morning - then you can go get yourself another job.
Sorry, boss
Sorry, boss
Don't be sorry. Just get the breakfast, that's all.
Who was that?
Grayson - Anne's lawyer.
Grayson - Anne's lawyer.
What did he want?
What did he want?
Gallagher, that guy just dropped by to give us a great opening for the third act.
It's a swell idea, Gallagher. How's this? The wife's family lawyer comes to see the kid, see - to talk over the divorce. Then this guy insults the poor but honest boy by offering him alimony - so the kid gets sore, socks the lawyer in the nose and throws him out. How's that for the beginning of the third act, huh?
Well, from now on the play will be easy. All you have to do is bring the wife back, have her say she's sorry, and then your play's over.
What other girl?
The little O'Brien girl, of course - the one you suggested in the story.
The little O'Brien girl, of course - the one you suggested in the story.
But that's ridiculous! You can't make a sudden change like that.
But that's ridiculous! You can't make a sudden change like that.
Gallagher, what are you going to do - tell me how to write a play?
Gallagher, what are you going to do - tell me how to write a play?
No.
No.
There's nothing sudden about that He's always loved the girl, but he was such a sap he didn't have sense enough to tell her. Well, that's all right - we can fix that. He will go to the little O'Brien girl, and - here, I'll show you.
Nice set of Conrads you have out there, Mrs. Schuyler. I was just glancing through this one. What's Michael tearing the paper about?
Just a habit. Mr. Schuyler is a bit put out by all the rumors going around.

Rumors? Rumors? Since when is a breach-of-promise case a rumor?
Rumors? Rumors? Since when is a breach-of-promise case a rumor?
No breach-of-promise case has been filed. The matter has been settled out of court.
No breach-of-promise case has been filed. The matter has been settled out of court.
Oh I see, but Gloria doesn't seem to be satisfied with the twenty thousand dollars.
Well, well. That takes it out of the rumor class, doesn't it?
We admit nothing. However, I have a little statement all prepared.
A statement? Good.
I have it here.
I have it here.
Good.
The man from the Tribune seemed perfectly satisfied.
Who, Bingy? Yeah, Bingy would. He never saw fifty dollars before. You could have bought him for six bits. Funny thing about Bingy. The more he gets - the more he prints. He looks stupid, doesn't he? But oh how smart he gets when he bends over a typewriter.
I think you'd better go.
Go?! Wait a minute - that's a great story! Newspaper reporter was forcibly ejected from Schuyler Mansion, and
I've tried to stop the evening papers, but it's useless.
You quit trying to stop anybody
You quit trying to stop anybody
Well, at best you might deny it.
Well, at best you might deny it.
Why deny it? The more you deny, the more they print. Let them alone! The thing to do is to sit still and keep our traps shut.
Why deny it? The more you deny, the more they print. Let them alone! The thing to do is to sit still and keep our traps shut.
Traps shut!
Traps shut!
Certainly! I'll take care of this guy Bingy myself, personally. Now what are you crying about?
Hello, Smith.
Holy jumping swordfish!
Holy jumping swordfish!
I suppose you know why I came?
I suppose you know why I came?
No, I have no idea - unless some of the silver-ware is missing.
No, I have no idea - unless some of the silver-ware is missing.
Now don't be absurd, Smith May I come in?
Now don't be absurd, Smith May I come in?
Surely, come right in.

Thanks. May I sit down?
Thanks. May I sit down?
Surely, sit down. If I had known you were coming, I would have thrown you up a waffle.

You don't.
Anne asked me to come and see you about the divorce.
She did?
She did?
She wants me to arrange the financial settlement.
She wants me to arrange the financial settlement.
Listen Grayson, I've got 106 bucks and 75 cents in the bank. Now Anne can have any part of that she wants, but she'd better hurry because I'm spending it awfully fast.
Listen Grayson, I've got 106 bucks and 75 cents in the bank. Now Anne can have any part of that she wants, but she'd better hurry because I'm spending it awfully fast.
You don't seem to understand. Anne doesn't expect anything from you.
Wait a minute. Do I get from you that she wants to pay me alimony?
That's putting it crudely, but
Remember what I told you about that twentieth crack? All right, you've just made it. Before you go unconscious I want you to get this through your nut.
I beg your pardon.
I beg your pardon.
Unconscious. You know, when you don't know anything. Your natural state. There are some people - you can't buy their self-respect for a bucket of shekels - well, I happen to be one of those guys.
We just thought that
Don't think. Let me do all the thinking. Now you go back to that Schuyler outfit and tell them that I didn't marry that dame for her dough and I don't want any of her dough now. I was too poor to buy her a wedding present when we got married, so I'm giving her a divorce for a wedding present. Now, stand up!
Yes.
And now for that twentieth crack
Fine, but kinda thirsty.
Come right in - I'll get you a drink.
Come right in - I'll get you a drink.
Okay - you remember Joe
Okay - you remember Joe
Sure.
Sure.
I sort of invited him along to bend an elbow. You don't mind, do you?
I sort of invited him along to bend an elbow. You don't mind, do you?
It's all right. Bring him in.
Come in, Joe. It's all right.
Hello, Joe.
I'm sorry nobody could come.
The rest of the gang had to get out the morning edition - but they'll be down later.
The rest of the gang had to get out the morning edition - but they'll be down later.
Now Hank, are you sure they're coming? It will be lonesome without them. Smythe, take this crowd in there and give them a drink. And find out what the boys in the back room want!
What is it, Smythe?
Pardon me, madam - but what am I to say to the newspapermen?
Oh, Smythe, some bicarbonate of soda, quick - double strength. I know those news mongrels[3] will upset me.
I've anticipated it, madame. The bicarbonate is ready.
Some bicarbonate - quick!
Double strength!
Double-strength!
"Cinderella Man Grows Hair On Chest!"
Pardon me, madam. They phoned through from the Mayor's committee to remind you it's past the hour for the reception.
Are the cars ready?
Are the cars ready?
They've been ready for the last half hour.
Smythe, you've been drinking.
I have. Double-strength!
Dexter Grayson, you told me it was only ten thousandand you didn't even get those letters from that Jezebel!
Oh, so you did give her ten thousand dollars, eh? and there are letters...
As a matter of fact, I was just trying to decide the color of Anne's eyes. I can't tell whether they're blue, or whether they're violet. What would you say, Mrs. Schuyler?
Why
Indeed? Perhaps he will do me a great favor.
With pleasure, Madame!
With pleasure, Madame!
Get out of here.
Nobody seems to want to do anything Why not ask me? Perhaps I can offer a suggestion. Do what about what?
About what? Your marriage to Anne!
About what? Your marriage to Anne!
Oh, my marriage to Anne. Now Mrs. Schuyler, we don't want you to go to any trouble about that. We just want the usual blessings, that's all.
Stop calling me Mother!
All right, Grandma
All right, Grandma
This man's impossible! I can't talk to him. Grayson, let's go where we can talk - hic! See what you've done to me!?
Good morning, everybody Well, maybe it isn't a good morning, huh? Anne, did you ever get the feeling that there was someone else in the room with you?
Have you seen this?
Have you seen this?
Yes - the worm!
Yes - the worm!
I beg your pardon?
I beg your pardon?
He's a worm - and I'm gonna step on him!
He's a worm - and I'm gonna step on him!
To engage in a brawl! A cheap, common brawl, in my own home! "I wear the pants!" The pants ! Not even the trousers!
And you struck him right here in our house?
Yes, I'm sorry, I struck him right here in your house. And I'll strike anybody in anybody's house that calls me a Cinderella Man.
That's the fourteenth crack you've made to me. I'm keeping count. When you get to twenty, I'm gonna sock you right on the nose. As a matter of fact, I ought to sock you right now.
Anne Schuyler, are you going to sit there and watch this man insult us? Haven't you any decency left?
What's going on here? Who is this woman?
Joan of Arc! What's it to you?
Joan of Arc! What's it to you?
Heavens! The man's insane!
Heavens! The man's insane!
Sure I'm insane, but I've got some good news for you. This magnolia is leaving your sweet smelling vanilla joint. This bird in a cage is gonna button his own pants from now on. And that is what is known as telling the mother- in-law.
There are no gentlemen on the Tribune.
I understand, sir.
Now, now Jeeves.[5] Was that nice? Was that being a gentleman, Jeeves? Was it, Jeeves? Your name is Jeeves, isn't it?
The name is Smythe.
The name is Smythe.
Smythe! Well, well, well! With a Y , huh? Congratulations! What a small world. Brothers under livery. Shake! Now, as a Smith to a Smythe

Mrs. Schuyler is not at home.
Mrs. Schuyler is not at home.
I know, I know. I waited outside till she went out. She's a very nice lady, but we don't vibrate well together.
But I
Now the lady said you may go
Well done, sir. Very neat.
That's what I think of it, Bingy!
Smythe, the - er - gentleman is leaving.
Yes, sir.
Did you call, sir?
Smythe, come here. I want to talk to you. Come on, Smythe, talk to me. Smythe, I'm going nuts. I'm going nuts in this house! This big . . . come on, I'm not going to hurt you. Come on, what's the matter with you?
Shhh! Do you hear something?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
You try it.
You try it.
Me, sir?
Me, sir?
Yeah.
No, that's enough. I just wanted you to get the idea. Now you know. This house is haunted.
No, sir!
No, sir!
Yes. Have you looked in the closets all over . . .?
Yes. Have you looked in the closets all over . . .?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Found no skeletons?
Found no skeletons?
No, sir.
No, sir.
It's haunted just the same.
It's haunted just the same.
Yes, sir.
Smythe, what do you do with yourself - I mean, when you're not carrying those double-strength - what do you do with yourself?
Well, sir, I putter.
Well, sir, I putter.
Smythe! I mean - when you're alone and want to amuse yourself, then what?
Smythe! I mean - when you're alone and want to amuse yourself, then what?
I just putter.
I just putter.
Hmmm, you just putter. Do you have to have a putter to putter?
Hmmm, you just putter. Do you have to have a putter to putter?
Oh no, sir. I putter with me hands.
Oh no, sir. I putter with me hands.
Well, isn't that nice? You just go right ahead and putter with your hands. That's all right. How do you do it?
Well, isn't that nice? You just go right ahead and putter with your hands. That's all right. How do you do it?
Well sir, I'll show you.
That's puttering, sir.
No! Well, well, well! That's all right, if you like it. Can anybody do that?
No! Well, well, well! That's all right, if you like it. Can anybody do that?
Oh no, sir. Some people are natural putterers. Others can never master it.
Oh no, sir. Some people are natural putterers. Others can never master it.
Oh my. You mean, some people are born and never will become putterers?
Oh my. You mean, some people are born and never will become putterers?
Yes sir.
Yes sir.
Oh my, wouldn't that be tragic? To know that you could never be a putterer.
Oh my, wouldn't that be tragic? To know that you could never be a putterer.
Yes sir.
Yes sir.
How about me? Do you think if I concentrated and put my whole soul into it, that some day I might be a putterer?
How about me? Do you think if I concentrated and put my whole soul into it, that some day I might be a putterer?
You sir? Uh-uh. You could never be a putterer. Not a good putterer, sir.
You sir? Uh-uh. You could never be a putterer. Not a good putterer, sir.
Well, if I couldn't be a good putterer, I wouldn't want to putter. But why? What makes you think I couldn't be a good putterer?
Well, if I couldn't be a good putterer, I wouldn't want to putter. But why? What makes you think I couldn't be a good putterer?
Well sir, to be a putterer, one's mind must be at ease. A person with a problem could never be a putterer. For instance, sir, a fish can putter in water but not on land because he'd be out of place. An eagle can putter around a rugged mountaintop but not in a cage, because he'd be restless and unhappy. Now sir, if you

That's all I wanted to know!
Smythe, I'll get this. I'm expecting some friends.
Very good, sir.
It isn't done, gentlemen! It isn't done, I say! It isn't done!
Well, Gallagher, you certainly took no chances, did you?
I just love you in that sweater Mary-Sue. It's so flattering.
Thanks.
I put blueberries in them just the way you like.
Actually--I'm not real ... hungry.
Actually--I'm not real ... hungry.
Oh nonsense young lady. You're going to start your day with a nice big breakfast.
Mary Sue?

Sure.
What goes on up at Lover's Lane?

Well, you hear all these things lately. You know--kids spending so much time up there ... Is it holding hands? That kind of thing?

Thank you.
Sure.
I made you these for the trip. They're marshmallow rice squares.
Thanks. I thought you weren't gonna ...
Thanks. I thought you weren't gonna ...
I had to say goodbye.
There's a meatloaf sandwich in there too. Don't go skipping dinner just 'cause you're not here anymore.
I won't.
I won't.
And ... wear this on the trip in case it gets cold.
And ... wear this on the trip in case it gets cold.

But I really should get home.

But you can't go out there.
Sounds nice ... Once you get used to it.
Yeah. It does.
Like a drum.

How was your day?
Oh, swell. You know, Mr. Connel said that if things keep going the way they are, I might be seeing that promotion sooner than I thought.
Oh, swell. You know, Mr. Connel said that if things keep going the way they are, I might be seeing that promotion sooner than I thought.
Oh darling that's wonderful! I always knew you could do it.
Bud, your sister's a little older now and she's naturally going to start going out with boys. ... In fact pretty soon--she's even going to get married and make someone a good little home-maker like your mother here. That's IF she can learn to bake.
Oh, George ...
Oh, George ...
But your sister is a fine young woman and she would never do anything for us to be concerned about.
I told you where I was.
All night?
All night?
I got caught in the storm. You were gone all night too.
I got caught in the storm. You were gone all night too.
I was in a bowling-alley.
Look. Let's just forget about it. Let's just go to the meeting and ...
I told you, George. I'm not going.
I told you, George. I'm not going.
Sure you are.

It's fine. You'll put on some make up and ...
It's fine. You'll put on some make up and ...
I don't want to put on some make up ...
It goes away ... It'll go away.
I don't want it to go away.
Okay--now you listen to me ... You're gonna come to this meeting and you're gonna put on this make up, and you're gonna come home at six o'clock every night and have dinner ready on this table.
No I'm not sweetie.
I made a couple of lunches for you and put them in brown paper bags ... I'm gonna go now.
Where are you gonna go?
Where are you gonna go?
I'm gonna go now.
What's all the commotion? Where's the cat?
Um ... It's ...
I sure am glad you said you'd come out with me tonight Mary Sue.
Well "gee whizz" Biff. I sure am glad you asked me.
I don't know if I ever said this to you before, but, well ... I think you're just about the keenest girl in the whole school ...
Really Biff? The keenest?
Really Biff? The keenest?
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.
Gosh. I hardly know what to say.
... And you always seemed so smart and everything. Like that report you did on "Our Town Hall." Gosh. I didn't know what I'd talk to you about.
Well, sometimes talking's over-rated. Don't you think?
Well, sometimes talking's over-rated. Don't you think?
Hunh? Oh, right ...
So I know I haven't been steady with anybody, but I just don't want to rush it. You don't want to make a mistake with something that important.
Oh, gosh no.
Oh, gosh no.
I mean, there's kids that are even holding hands already but I figure there's plenty of time for that kind of thing later on. Don't you?
I mean, there's kids that are even holding hands already but I figure there's plenty of time for that kind of thing later on. Don't you?

To be honest Mary Sue. I didn't think you'd want to come here until we'd been pinned for a little while.
To be honest Mary Sue. I didn't think you'd want to come here until we'd been pinned for a little while.
Oh, Biff. You can "pin" me any time you want to.

I think ... I might be ill ...
It's s'posed to happen, Biff.
It is?

You want to ask her out tonight, right? And then you want to give her your school pin ...
Yeah ... How'd you know?
Yeah ... How'd you know?
Lucky guess. Look, Biff ... I don't think it's a real good time for that right now ...
What I mean is ... Mary Sue's been a little "different" lately ...
She won't go out with me?
She won't go out with me?
I didn't say that. It's just that right now ...
I didn't say that. It's just that right now ...
I don't know what I'd do if she wouldn't go out with me ...
What'll it be?
Gee whizz, Bud. Guess I'll just have the usual. Cheeseburger and a cherry coke.
Maybe you can't even describe it. Maybe you only know it when it's gone. Maybe it's like there's a whole piece of you that's missing too. You might even call it "love."
Okay, that's IT!!!
Okay, that's IT!!!
Now don't you think she looks just as pretty in color? Don't you think she looks just as pretty as she did the day you met her?
C'mon. Everyone's turning colors. Kids are making out in the street. No one's getting their dinner-- hell, you could have a flood any minute ... Pretty soon you could have the women going off to work while the men stayed home and cooked ...
That's not going to happen!
That's not going to happen!
But it could happen.
But it could happen.
No it couldn't!
Want some bridge mix?

"Changes."

No. They do. And it isn't just 'cause you're a great bowler ... They respect you ...
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
And it's important for them to see someone they respect, stand up for what's right. If you love a place, you can't sit around and watch this kind of thing happen to it.

What happened?
Well, I ... I came home like I always do, And I came in the front door. And I took off my coat. And I put down my briefcase and I said "Honey. I'm home."
Did you do this?
Yes I did.
Do you know that it's illegal?
Yes I do.
BUD--WHY DID YOU DO THIS?
Because anybody should be able to paint in whatever color they want.
You're not allowed to do this! I could arrest you for this.
Still doesn't make it right.
Bud Parker and William Johnson, you have been charged with desecration of a public building and the intentional use of prohibited paint colors in violation of the Pleasantville Code of Conduct and laws of common decency. Do you admit that on the night of May 1, you did consciously and willfully apply the following FORBIDDEN colors to the Pleasantville Town Hall: Red, Pink, Vermillion,
Um ... Yes I do. Where's our lawyer?
Um ... Yes I do. Where's our lawyer?
We prefer to keep these proceedings as "pleasant" as possible. I don't think a lawyer will be necessary.
Do you further admit that this was done surreptitiously and under the cover of darkness?
Well--it was dark out ...
Well--it was dark out ...
Good. Do you further admit that this unnatural depiction occurred in full public view where it was accessible to, and in plain sight of, minor children?

It was accessible to everyone.

Very well. Let the record show that the defendants have answered in the affirmative to all the charges.
I think I've got something to say.
Very well ...
It's like the basketball team.
The basketball team?
The basketball team?
Sure. Everybody's upset because they're not winning anymore--but just think how it would feel if all of a sudden they do win.
See, I know you want it to stay "Pleasant" but there are so many things that are so much better: like Silly ... or Sexy ... or Dangerous ... or Wild ... or Brief ... And every one of those things is in you all the time if you just have the guts to look for them. Look at those faces back there. They're
Okay--that's enough!
Okay--that's enough!
I thought I was allowed to defend myself.

You're not allowed to lie.

Why am I out of order?
Why am I out of order?
BECAUSE I WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO TURN THIS COURTROOM INTO A CIRCUS!
BECAUSE I WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO TURN THIS COURTROOM INTO A CIRCUS!
Well I don't think it's a circus. And I don't think they do either.
THIS BEHAVIOR WILL STOP AT ONCE.
But see that's just the point. It can't stop at once. Because it's in you. And you can't stop something that's in you.
But see that's just the point. It can't stop at once. Because it's in you. And you can't stop something that's in you.

What's outside of Pleasantville?
Look it doesn't matter. It's not important.
Look it doesn't matter. It's not important.

How long do you think you've been here?
I don't know ... Three, four weeks.
I don't know ... Three, four weeks.
Much less than that. An hour and a half.

I'm going on trial tomorrow?

So they can have their hamburgers!
You know what I really like?
... What's that?

I'm no longer a man! I awoke to discover I'd turned into a sparrow!

Not now, or we're both done for.

If I wasn't such a bad woman on the page, Abbe, I'll hazard I couldn't be such a good woman in life.
In part, yes.
He's not the man who's cast a shadow here.
The Doctor's a respected man, a friend of the court --
I haven't been to see the Marquis for ages. And I won't -- ever again -- I swear it. I won't speak to him, I won't even utter his name --
I haven't been to see the Marquis for ages. And I won't -- ever again -- I swear it. I won't speak to him, I won't even utter his name --
Is that a promise you can truly keep?
Charenton has changed; it's not safe for you here.
I've you to look after me, haven't I?
Don't turn us out, Abbe.
"Turn you out?"
It's a sin against God for me to refuse your kindness. But my heart's held fast here...
By whom? The Marquis?
By whom? The Marquis?
Mother's not half so blind as you.
Madeleine, I... there are certain things... feelings... we must not voice.
Why not?
Why not?
They incite us to act. In ways we should not... cannot... a lesson the Marquis would do well to learn.
Go back to your room. Quickly.
What? What've I done?

Don't come back, not tonight, not again --
Don't come back, not tonight, not again --
You'll hate me now, won't you?
If you'd grant me a final favor, I'd like the chance to explain myself --
Don't come any closer, Abbe. God's watching.
They've got no right, sending someone to sit on your shoulder. I work for you; I won't take orders from a stranger.
You needn't worry, Valcour. It's administrative, nothing more.
Free his mouth.
Mustn't do that, sir.

I must grant him his last rites.

Conversation, like certain portions of the anatomy, always runs more smoothly when it's lubricated.
I should've told you it was the blood of Christ; you'd believe that, wouldn't you?
We treat you well enough here, don't we Marquis? Your very own featherbed, in lieu of a straw mat. Your antique writing desk, all the way from LaCoste. Enough quills to feather an ostrich --

Take your pen in hand, Marquis. Purge these wicked thoughts of yours on paper; maybe they'll govern you less in life.
I'll fill page after page, I promise.
Yes! It is! The paper's cheap, the type's too small --

It's not even a proper novel! It's nothing but an encyclopedia of perversions! Frankly, it even fails as an exercise in craft. The characters are wooden; the dialogue is inane. Not to mention the endless repetition of words like "nipple" and "pikestaff" --

You've a touch of the poet, too; perhaps you should take up the quill.
Do I have your word?
If you only mean to dupe me again --
Honestly! You cut me to the core! What's the point of all your valiant attempts at rehabilitation if -- when I finally succumb -- when at long last, I pledge myself to righteous conduct -- you regard me with nothing but suspicion? Have you no faith in your own medicine?
You mean to take us all down with you?
Don't be absurd; it's only a play.

Try reading, for a change. The writer who produces more than he reads? The sure mark of an amateur.
Start with the Bible; it's cheerier, and more artfully written.

We inspected the body, Marquis. She died a virgin.
I dare you. Stab my flesh. Which one of us will bleed?
Tomorrow, we'll cut out your tongue.

I'm here.
I'm here.
Surely you'll grant me a final word.

It seems a particular patient of yours has captured his fancy.
I understand he practices the very crimes he preaches in his fiction.
A few indiscretions in his youth.
Indiscretions, Abbe? Please. I've read his case history. At sixteen, he violated a serving girl with a crucifix. After six months in the dungeon at Vincennes, he mutilated a prostitute, cutting her flesh with a razor, then cauterizing the wounds with wax --
I hope you'll judge him by his progress here, and not his past reputation.
He's made a great success of our Little Theater; there's seldom an empty seat. Not to mention its therapeutic value.
Playing dress-up with cretins? That sounds like a symptom of madness; not its cure.
Why is he in your care, and not a proper prison?
His wife's influence.
His wife's influence.
His wife's?
His wife's?
Better to have an insane spouse than a criminal one.
And he's never once attempted escape?
A man of his notoriety? He wouldn't last a day on the streets without capture.
Besides, every wholesome thing he might desire, he has at Charenton. A library, filled with the world's great books, music lessons, watercolor exercises --
What is the impact of all these amenities upon his psyche?

Do more. Otherwise, I'll be forced to report to the Ministry that the inmates are indeed running the asylum.

If only blood will appease you, then shed mine.
You'd suffer in her stead?
As you say, Doctor.
He was so impressed with the Marquis' tale that he chose to re-enact it, yes?
Perhaps you'll be so kind as to remind me of her name...
I beg you, Doctor, don't make me say it.

Gibberish, my friend. He rants and he raves --
"As he loosened his manhood from beneath his robes, The Bishop muttered a Latin prayer. And then -- with a mighty thrust -- drove it into her very entrails --"
Enough!
As for the author... shoot him.
A word of caution, Sire: we all remember what happened to Robespierre, Danton and Marat. Put the Marquis to death, and history might even regard you as a despot.

I'm afraid so; he's an idealist. You'll have to be politic.

His wife was trying to escape; they caught her on the stair, and set upon her with bayonets. "There but for the grace of God"... eh, Doctor?
I don't shed tears over the past, Monsieur Delbenè; I look to the future.
Here it is; the last chapter.
Monsieur Masse says he'd like another manuscript, quick as you please. He's got himself three presses, and he can't print 'em fast enough.

At last she arrives, my hard-won bride! Hurry, my child, and scurry inside. There you'll find such treasures await you; Marzipan and meringue to sate you!
Such gallantry in men is -- sadly -- a rarity; How lucky I am to receive his charity!
Quickly, my suckling, out of your clothes! My scepter awaits; how solid it grows!
Stop, I beg you! Have pity, I say! You're not my lover; you're a monstrous rouè!
My darling, Eugenie, dainty morsel! Get on your back! Let's try it dorsal!

It's because of the Marquis, isn't it?
I'm hungry for a proper visit.
Don't start --
Don't start --
Go ahead; you've a key. Slip it through my tiny hole...

My newest book begins at my right cuff, continues across my back, and completes itself at the base of my left shoe...
I don't believe it!
They've taken your clothes?
They decreed me a savage, and now they have made me one.
Surely you've seen a man naked.
It's only been described to me. In your books.
I must say, in your novels you stoke the most unrealistic expectations.
You're far crueler than I, my sweet.
The Abbe's sending me away. He fears for me here, what with the likes of you --
Don't be fooled, Madeleine! He fears for himself. He's like a man starving, and you -- ha! -- you're like a pork chop dolloped with heavy cream --

I beg to differ, Doctor. You work in a madhouse. Your every waking moment is governed by the insane.
I pray you: be succinct.

You're new to Charenton, yes? Perhaps you're not yet familiar with my husband, and his unusual case.
You're new to Charenton, yes? Perhaps you're not yet familiar with my husband, and his unusual case.
With all due respect, Madame, all France is familiar with your husband. Grant us a moment alone, won't you, Monsieur Prouix?
I assume you've come to plead for clemency on your husband's behalf.
Oh you do, do you? It is my dearest hope, Doctor, that he remain entombed forever, and that when at last he perishes in the dank bowels of your institution, he be left as carrion for the rodents and the worms.
You're aware, are you not, that it costs a great deal to house your husband at Charenton...
I pay his stipend every month, far more dutifully than I should.
I pay his stipend every month, far more dutifully than I should.
That barely covers the cost of his room. There's nary a penny left over for appropriate treatments. Opiates to quell his temper. Restraints to chasten him when he misbehaves.

That ill-gotten funds, borne of his degeneracy, might now effect his salvation.
If you're truly determined to step out of the shadow of your husband's celebrity --
Oh, but I am!
Oh, but I am!
-- words alone are insufficient.
-- words alone are insufficient.
It's beyond perversity. That honor should carry a price tag...
Don't toy with me, Doctor.
Now is the time to secure your epitaph. The benevolent Marquise, Charenton's most revered philanthropist... or Satan's Bride.
I am eternally in your debt.
And I in yours.
And I in yours.
Doctor... Can I impart to you his cruelest trick?
Doctor... Can I impart to you his cruelest trick?
Of course.
Of course.
Once... long ago... in the folly of youth... he made me love him.
Good God, Marquise --
I'm on the brink of bankruptcy; my husband's resources are all but exhausted. And to what end, I ask you?
This is neither the time nor the place --
If only you'd remained true to our contract! Opiates, for his nerves! Restraints! The man warrants a bed of nails --
If only you'd remained true to our contract! Opiates, for his nerves! Restraints! The man warrants a bed of nails --
I can say, with the utmost sincerity, that every franc you've given me has been put to sterling use.
You've no right to assault me in this fashion; I'll call for my footman. I'll have you removed --
Am I a cursed woman, Doctor? Must I be betrayed by every man I meet --
Public scorn carries a terrible sting. Trust me. I'm a woman who knows.
It's libelous; you wouldn't dare.
It's libelous; you wouldn't dare.
And why not? My fortune, siphoned away. My reputation, past repair. I've nothing left to lose. Silence my husband, or you'll come to know an infamy to rival his own.
Hm? Tell me. What other treats?
....shame on you, truly...
For fuck's sake, woman! BONBONS? I'm to sit here, gorging myself on useless trifles, sucking down your little sweetmeats, when what I truly need -- what I truly require -- are a few quill pens? Perhaps a pot of ink?
Forgive me, I beg you --
How was I to know, my darling?
How was I to tell you? By writing a letter? WITH WHAT, MY ASININE BRIDE?
I beg you, Donatien... as your wife... your only ally... you must stop making such a monstrous spectacle of yourself.

You ought to court the Doctor's favor, not his contempt.
Everywhere I go, they point and whisper! At the opera, they hiss at me when I take my box. When I went to church... the priest refused to even hear my confession; he said I was already damned! Why must I suffer for your sins?
It's the way of all martyrs, isn't it?
It's the way of all martyrs, isn't it?
Give me back my anonymity, that's all I ask! Let me be invisible again!

Leave at once --
But it's just begun --

Image a man that has shaped his time. A titanic figure of limitless influence. Think about empire. A man with an empire at his feet. A man, like a baron, living in a palace, a glorious palace on a hill, and controlling the permutations of everyone beneath him. Feudal.

Orson. Stop. Just stop
Now remember he's a public figure who sought out that publicity so legally he can't stop us from--
Listen to you. You child! Men like him don't bother with things like legality. They don't have to. You know why, boy-o? Power. Power like you couldn't even begin to imagine.

You may think you know what you're talking about, kid, but believe me, you don't. You're talking about going into a battle you can never win on a battlefield so far above things like movies and Hollywood that Hearst won't even have to glance down when he crushes you. When he flicks you away with one finger. I'm talking about money and influence and

How does it feel, Mank? Going up to the palace and making all the lords and ladies laugh as you tell your little stories and beg for crumbs at the table? How does it feel being the ugly little monkey they keep to amuse themselves--?!

All men love. But men like Hearst -- they don't bother with convention because--
They don't have to.
They don't have to.
He loves in his own way. On his conditions. Because those are the only conditions he has ever known.
Hearst looks down at the world at his feet Everything has always been beneath him.
And what does he see?
And what does he see?
The people. When they pay him homage, he adores them. But when they have the ... audacity to question him. To doubt him. To embarrass him. Then he despises them.

Shit
George...
What have I done?
Aw, cheer up, George'll probably be running Fox by the morning. Let's get a drink.
You know, all this nightmare we went through with Hearst. The whole thing... And in the end, probably no one will ever remember the picture anyway.
Yeah, you're probably right.
He truly doesn't care if he ever works again.
Yeah, ain't it swell?
They came to me with an offer. 800,000 for the negative and all the prints.
And they went to the stockholders in New York.

Listen, get off your horse with me. You know I've stuck by you since the beginning of time it seems like, while the stockholders in New York were ready to cut and run and everyone else in Hollywood was set to toss me in a rubber room. But your contract stipulates a max budget of 500 thousand. This one's gonna come in at 750
Now don't have a fit -- but I want you to think again about doing WAR OF THE WORLDS-

How can he embarrass you?
How can he embarrass you?
He's an embarrassment because Frankie and the other guys are expectin' me to do something about it, and I'm lookin' very bad. I can't deliver a kid from my own neighborhood. Why's he make it so hard on himself? He comes to me, I can make it easier for him.

Positive.
Positive.
You're the one who said he was good looking. You think he's good looking 'cause I know you think he's good- looking. I'll smash his face inside out. I'll make him into dog meat. Nobody's gonna think he's good-looking when I get through with him. So you just go ahead and think about who you want.
Hey, you don't say goodbye to him like that.
What did I do?

You don't kiss like that. Hello and goodbye, that's all you do.

Don't ever do that again. You don't do it!
Don't ever do that again. You don't do it!
Jake...
What's the matter with you?
Tryin' to get this fuckin' TV to work. Paid all this money for it and still can't get a station a mile away. And Mr. Wizard here ain't no help.

Answer me when I talk to you. What happened that night?
Answer me when I talk to you. What happened that night?
I am answering...
I am answering...
What do I have to do to get a straight answer around here.
Jake, no --
Do I have to kill you, eh? Do I have to kill somebody to get an answer? I know about you at the Copa. I know all about it.
I didn't do anything wrong. I swear. I just had a few drinks.
With Salvy, eh?
With Salvy, eh?
I went with Sandy and Vera. Salvy was there. Stop it. I just had a drink, that's all. I didn't do anything wrong.
Come out of there! Did you fuck Salvy? Answer me. Open this fuckin' door, you fuckin' cunt! Who've you been fuckin'?
Nobody, I tell you. Jake stop it.
Nobody, I tell you. Jake stop it.
You're a fuckin' liar.
I'll say anything you want me to say. I fuckled Salvy. I fucked Tommy. I fucked your brother. I fucked everybody! What do you want to hear? I sucked your brother's fuckin' cock!
You did?
You did?
Yeah, I sucked his cock.
You're killing him. You're killing him for nothing. Stop it.
Get the fuck outa here. Whadda you mean nothing'? You stupid bitch!
Get the fuck outa here. Whadda you mean nothing'? You stupid bitch!
Nothing is what I said! Go on, kill me. Kill me. I'm not afraid of you anymore. I don't care if you kill me like you're killing him. You're a sick animal.
You're the fuckin' animal! You ran around with every guy I knew while I was breakin' my ass for you.
You're not only an animal, you're a stupid animal. You're rotten. Rotten. Rotten. You're a sick maniac. A maniac! You belong in a mental hospital.
You know, if there's one thing -- I just don't understand you, not one single little bit. You love me?
Yeah --
Jake, why don't you just try lying down and get some rest.
I don't know what it is. I dunno, it's the kind of thing that -- the words won't come out.

I'm leaving you Jake.
I'm leaving you Jake.
Sure, what else is new?

No. This time it's true. I didn't bother to tell you until I had everything worked out.
Open the door, Vickie.
No. I won't talk to you where you can use your hands on me.
No. I won't talk to you where you can use your hands on me.
Aw, c'mon. Don't say that.

Aw, c'mon, Vick --
Aw, c'mon, Vick --
I'm sick of it. I can't watch you this way. You're too drunk all the time. There's too many girls. I can't... I don't wanna talk about it. I made up my mind.
Vickie, open up. I need to come in.
Are you drunk?

No. Open the door.
The kids are sleeping.

What friends?
Hi, Tommy. How are you?
Jake, sit down for a minute.
Fuckin' kid! You're the best fuckin' fighter around. Loved what you did to Satterfield. Them "moulan yans" -- forget about it. They're all afraid to fight you.
C'mon, Tommy --
C'mon, Tommy --
How you feelin'? Ok? You feelin' good?

He should.
He should.
This Janiro's a good fighter, pretty good-lookin' kid.
How's the weight? Ok?
Yeah, the weight's Ok.
All right, lemme ask you something. Let's say I was a good friend of yours. And I was telling you I was gonna bet a lot of money on you in this Janiro fight. What would you tell me?
I'd tell you to bet a bundle.
Salvy, would I steer you wrong? Let's say that's the truck; it's full of cigarettes, right? Now, two o'clock this morning we move the truck from here to there, take the cigarettes out, sell 'em, make some cash.
Hey but Joey, you're thinking nickels and dimes. The money's with your brother.
Hey but Joey, you're thinking nickels and dimes. The money's with your brother.
What do you want from my life, Salvy? He's my brother.
What do you want from my life, Salvy? He's my brother.
He ain't doin' the right thing. He's makin' beans compared to what he should be makin'. Can't you make him understand that?
Hey, leave the kids alone.
Get lost. Hey kids, "A cop is a rat." Remember that, "A rat."
I can't convince him. He's got such a thick head, I'd like to crack it open myself. Believe me, my own brother. It's very hard. You don't have to convince me -- I know we should be with Tommy. You talk to him. He don't listen to nobody.
Look, I'm just tellin' you how Tommy feels. Jake is makin' it hard on himself. Tommy wants him with us. It's as simple as that.
Talk some sense into him, will ya? You're still his brother. If he ain't gonna listen to you, he ain't gonna listen to nobody!
All right, I'll try. See you later.
All right, I'll try. See you later.
Tomorrow, at the gym. Don't forget.

Hey Joey, I'm here with Patsy and Vera and Sandy. And Vickie just happened to come along. We're just trying to have a good time. What do you want from me? So, why don't you just take it easy before this gets out of hand.
Hey Joey, whadda ya lookin' to die young?
I'll suck your eyes out! I'll fuckin' take the two of you.
What're you doin' with Salvy? You shouldn't be here with him. Jake's away killin' himself. Suppose he found out.
What the hell am I doing wrong? Just because Jake is training, I can't go out? What am I, a goddamn prisoner?

No, you're his wife.

Well, go ahead, tell Jake. He's gonna kill me anyway. It's a matter of time.

You don't sleep with him. I do. I don't get to breathe without tellin' him. He keeps me in a cage. If he thinks I'm lookin' at somebody the wrong way, I get used as a punching bag. He don't trust nobody. If he saw the two of us talking together right now, you'd be in trouble too -- believe me. Look at me,

Don't worry -- it comes off today.
It was in her favorite handbag -- And, Mr. Doyle, that can lead to only one conclusion.
Namely?
Like disposing of their wives?
Get that idea out of your mind. It will only lead you in the wrong direction.
Of course, it's normal for a man to tie his trunk up with a heavy rope.
When the lock is broken -- yes.
Mrs. -- Thorwald's -- clothes. -- Clean -- carefully packed -- not too stylish -- but presentable.
Didn't you take it to the crime lab?
I would say that is looked as if she wasn't coming back.
That's what they call a family problem.
You didn't see the killing, or the body? How do you know there was a murder?
Because everything that man's done has been suspicious. Trips at night in the rain, saws, knives, trunks with rope, and a wife that isn't there any more.

I'll admit it all has a mysterious sound -- but is could mean a number of different things. Murder is the least likely.

Go ahead, Doyle -- tell me he's an unemployed magician -- amusing the neighborhood with sleight-of-hand.
It's too stupid and obvious a way to murder -- in full view of fifty windows -- and then sit over there -- -- smoking a cigar -- waiting for the police to pick him up.
Well, officer -- do your duty.
Well, officer -- do your duty.
You've got a lot to lean about homicide, Jeff. Morons have committed murder so shrewdly that it took a hundred trained police minds to catch them. That salesman wouldn't just knock off his wife after dinner, toss her in a trunk and put her in storage.

Almost everything's been done -- under panic. But this is a thousand to one shot. That man's still sitting around his apartment; he isn't panicked.

By the way what happened to your leg?
I was jaywalking.
He has a six months lease, and has used up a little over five and a half months of it. Quiet. Drinks, but not to drunkenness. Pays his bill promptly, with money earned as a consume jewelry salesman -- wholesale. Keeps to himself, and none of the neighbors got close to him, or his wife.
I think they missed their chance with her.

Too bad. The Thorwalds were just leaving the apartment house at that time.
Feel a little foolish?
Not yet.
Who said they left then?
Who left -- where?
Who left -- where?
The Thorwalds -- at six in the morning?
The building superintendent, and two tenants. Flat statements -- no hesitation. And they all jibed to the letter. The Thorwalds were leaving for the railroad station.
Now how could anybody guess that? They had, perhaps, signs on their luggage, "Grand Central Or Bust!"?

Well then do a good job of it! Get over there, and search Thorwald's apartment! It must be knee-deep in evidence.

I can hear myself starting out. "Your Honor -- I have a friend who's an amateur sleuth, an one night, after a heavy supper --" He'd throw the New York State Penal Code right in my face. -- And it's six volumes.

Mrs. Thorwald.
Enough to scare me that you wouldn't get here in time, and we'd lose him.

I don't know what pet name Thorwald had for his wife. And that night he went out half a dozen times with the metal suitcase. He wasn't taking his possessions, because they're up in his apartment now!

In sections! And one other thing, doubting Tom -- it just occurred to me that all the calls Thorwald made were long distance! If he called his wife the day she left -- after she arrived in Merritsville -- why did she need to send him a postcard saying she'd arrived?

Just don't dally. Thorwald knows he's being watched. He won't hang around long.

Well -- you know best. Call you later, Jeff.

Can you get me that ring back?
No.
No.
Tell her to bring it back!
I can't. The police have it by now.
Then if the police get me -- you won't be around to laugh!

Well, I only quote from the best.

Right now I'd even welcome trouble.

It's very simple. She belongs in that rarefied atmosphere of Park Avenue, expensive restaurants, and literary cocktail parties.

Can you see her tramping around the world with a camera bum who never has more than a week's salary in the bank? If only she was ordinary.
You're never going to marry?
Probably. But when I do, it'll be to someone who thinks of life as more than a new dress, a lobster dinner, and the latest scandal. I need a woman who'll go anywhere, do anything, and love it.
The only honest thing to do is call it off. Let her look for somebody else.
I can just hear you now. "Get out of here you perfect, wonderful woman! You're too good for me!"
I can just hear you now. "Get out of here you perfect, wonderful woman! You're too good for me!"
That's the hard part.
Look, Mr. Jefferies. I'm not educated. I'm not even sophisticated. But I can tell you this -- when a man and a woman see each other, and like each other -- they should come together -- wham like two taxies on Broadway. Not sit around studying each other like specimens in at bottle.

Ask for trouble and you get it. Why there's a good boy in my neighborhood who went with a nice girl across the street for three years. Then he refused to marry her. Why? -- Because she only scored sixty-one on a Look Magazine marriage quiz!
When I married Myles, we were both maladjusted misfits. We still are. And we've loved every minute of it.
That's fine, Stella. Now would you make me a sandwich?
Okay -- but I'm going to spread some common sense on the bread. Lisa Fremont's loaded to her fingertips with love for you. I'll give you two words of advice. Marry her.
She pay you much?
The insurance Company would be a lot happier if you slept in your bed, not the wheelchair.

His personal effects. He's probably running away -- the coward.
Sometimes it's worse to stay than it is to run.

A Federal offense.
Get back there! He'll see you!
I'm not shy. I've been looked at before.
It's not an ordinary look. It's the kind of look a man gives when he's afraid somebody might be watching him.
Goodbye, Mr. Jefferies. I'll see you tomorrow.
Uh-huh.
Stella, I -- I can't tell you what a welcome sight this is. No wonder your husband's still in love with you.
Police?
Police?
Huh?
Huh?
You called the police?
You called the police?
Oh. Well, yes and no. It wasn't an official call. He's just a friend. An old, ornery friend.
I'm just going to get the name of their truck!
I'll watch the alleyway -- in case it goes that way.
Mrs. Thorwald?
Uh-uh. The dog. I think I know now why Thorwald killed it.
You mean the one the dog was sniffing around?
And digging in. Look at that flower bed.
There's a dip at this end. And since when do flowers grow shorter in two weeks?
There's something buried there.
You shouldn't have let her do that! If he ever --
Look!
Thank heaven that's over!
I have a feeling we've just begun.
I wonder.
What?

Miss Lonely Hearts just laid out something that looks like sodium trieckonal capsules.

Then I wouldn't worry too much. But let's keep an eye on her.
You know? You might not be too bad a bargain for Lisa after all.
You don't say! I might just take that compliment as an insult.
What are you two talking about?
Got a shovel?

No.
No.
There's probably one in the basement.

Now wait a minute --
You know, Miss Fremont -- he might just have something there.
There's no point in taking unnecessary chances. Give me the phone book, Lisa.
What's she trying to do? Why doesn't she turn him in?
Smart girl.
Smart girl.
Smart? She'll be arrested!
Smart? She'll be arrested!
That'll get her out of there, won't it?
When you took your first snapshot -- did you ever think it would bring you to this?
Stella -- how long do you think he'll stay there?
Stella -- how long do you think he'll stay there?
Unless he's dumber than I think, he won't wait 'til his lease is up.
What do you need money for?
To bail Lisa out of jail.
One hundred and twenty-seven.
How much do you think you'll need?
How much do you think you'll need?

-- A steal at eleven hundred dollars.

Hasn't been any big demand for tickets.
Picked it up in Shanghai -- which has also seen better days.
It's cracked -- and you never use it. And it's too ornate. I'm sending up a plain, flat silver one -- with just your initials engraved.

What would you think of starting off with dinner at the "21"?
You have, perhaps, an ambulance outside?
Big enough?
Fine. Corkscrew's on the right.
I couldn't think of anything more boring and tiresome than what you've been through. And the last week must be the hardest.
Yeah -- I want to get this thing off and get moving.
Yeah -- I want to get this thing off and get moving.
Well, I'm going to make this a week you'll never forget.
What a day I've had!
Tired?
Tired?
Not a bit. I was all morning in a sales meeting. Then over to the Waldorf for a quick drink with Madame Dufresne -- just over from Paris. With some spy reports. Back to the "21" for lunch with the Harper's Bazaar people -- that's when I ordered dinner. Then two Fall showings -- twenty blocks apart. Then I had to have a cocktail

You mean leave the magazine?

Yes.
Yes.
For what?

For yourself -- and me. I could get you a dozen assignments tomorrow... fashion, portraits --

Oh? You can see my apartment all the way up on 63rd street?

Well, she picked the most prosperous looking one.
She's not in love with him -- or any of them.

How can you tell that -- from here?

You said it resembled my apartment, didn't you?
Oh... some songwriter. In the studio apartment. Lives alone. Probably had an unhappy marriage.
I think it's enchanting.
Almost as if it were being written especially for us.
No wonder he's having so much trouble with it.
If you're saying all this just because you don't want to tell me the truth, because you're hiding something from me, then maybe I can understand --
There's nothing I'm hiding. It's just that --
There's nothing I'm hiding. It's just that --

All right. That's your opinion. You're entitled to it, but --
It's ridiculous for you to say that it can only be done by a special, private little group of anointed people.
Lisa, simmer down -- will you?
You can't fit in here -- I can't fit in there. According to you, people should be born, live an die on the same --

Did you ever eat fish heads and rice?
Of course not.
Of course not.
You might have to, if you went with me. Ever try to keep warm in a C-54, at fifteen thousand feet, at twenty below zero?
Oh, I do that all the time. Whenever I have a few minutes after lunch.
Ever get shot at, run over, sandbagged at night because people got unfavorable publicity from your camera?
Those high heels would be a lot of use in the jungle -- and those nylons and six-ounce lingerie --
Three.
Three.
Well, they'd be very stylish in Finland -- just before you froze to death. Begin to get the idea?
Huh? Try and find a raincoat in Brazil. Even when it isn't raining Lisa, on this job you carry one suitcase. Your home is the available transportation. You sleep rarely, bathe even less, and sometime the food you even look at when they were alive!
Jeff, you don't have to be deliberately repulsive just to impress me I'm wrong.
Jeff, you don't have to be deliberately repulsive just to impress me I'm wrong.
If anything, I'm making it sound good. Let's face it, Lisa... you aren't made for that kind of a life. Few people are.
You don't think either one of us could ever change?
Right now, it doesn't seem so.
And it's deflating to find out that the only way I can be part of it -- is to take out a subscription to your magazine. I guess I'm not the girl I thought I was.
There's nothing wrong with you, Lisa. You have the town in the palm of your hand.

Can't we just sort of keep things status quo?

Okay, Lisa -- probably you're right. He's probably in the bedroom now, entertaining his wife with the indian rope trick. I'll admit to criminal insanity. Now when do I start the cure?

That alligator bag his wife had on the bedpost --
What about it?
What about it?
He had it hidden in the dresser! Well, at least it was in there. He took it out, went to the phone and called somebody long distance. -- His wife's jewelry was in the handbag. And something about it worried him. He was asking somebody advice over the phone.

Someone not his wife?
Someone not his wife?
I never saw him ask her for advise before. But she volunteered plenty.
I wonder where he's going now?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Suppose he doesn't come back again?
Suppose he doesn't come back again?
He will. All his things are still piled on the bed.
Well, I guess it's safe to put on some lights now.
Not yet!
All day long I've tried to keep my mind on work.
Thinking about Thorwald?
Thinking about Thorwald?
And you, and you friend Doyle -- Did you hear from him again -- since he left?
And you, and you friend Doyle -- Did you hear from him again -- since he left?
Not a word. He was going to check on the railroad station, and the trunk. He must be still on it.
Something on your mind, Lisa?
It doesn't make sense to me.
It doesn't make sense to me.
What doesn't?

Women aren't that unpredictable.
Women aren't that unpredictable.
Lisa -- I can't guess what you're thinking.
A woman has a favorite handbag -- it always hangs on her bedpost where she can get at it. Then she takes a trip and leaves it behind. Why?
Because she didn't know she was going on a trip -- and where she was going she wouldn't need a handbag.
But only her husband would know that. And the jewelry! Women don't keep all their jewelry in a purse, all tangled, getting scratched and twisted up.
Do they hide it in their husband's clothes?
Do they hide it in their husband's clothes?
They do not! And they don't leave it behind them. A woman going anywhere but the hospital would always take makeup, perfume and jewelry.

Basic equipment. You don't leave it behind in your husband's drawer in your favorite handbag.

I'm with you, sweetie, but Detective Thomas J. Doyle has a pat answer for that.

Well, I have a pat rebuttal for Mr. Doyle -- that couldn't be Mrs. Thorwald -- or I don't know women.

Still -- those witnesses.
Still -- those witnesses.
We'll agree they saw a woman -- but she wasn't Mrs. Thorwald. -- That is, yet.
I'd like to see your friend's face when we tell him. He doesn't sound like much of a detective.
Don't be too hard on him. He's a steady worker. I wish he'd get there, though.
Don't be too hard on him. He's a steady worker. I wish he'd get there, though.
Don't rush me. We have all night.
We have all -- what?
Night. I'm going to stay with you.
Night. I'm going to stay with you.
You'll have to clear that through my landlord --
I have the whole weekend off.
Well that's fine, but I only have one bed, and --
Say anything else, and I'll stay tomorrow night too.
Lisa, I won't be able to give you any --
You said I'd have to live out of one suitcase I'll bet yours isn't this small?
That's a suitcase?
That's a suitcase?
A Mark Cross overnight case, anyway. Compact, but ample enough.
I'll trade you -- my feminine intuition for a bed for the night.
I'd be no better than Thorwald, to refuse.
From his landlord -- once a month.
It's utterly beautiful. I wish I could be creative.

You are. You have a talent for creating difficult situations.

Staying the night here, uninvited.
Surprise -- is the most important element of attack. And beside, you're not up on your private eye literature. When they're in trouble, it's always their Girl Friday who gets them out of it.
The same girl who keeps him out of the clutches of seductive show girls, and over-passionate daughters of the rich.

You mean -- like the kitchen? And make us some coffee?
Exactly what I had in mind -- along with some brandy.
I hate funny exit lines.
Who was the trunk addressed to?
Do you suppose it's ethical to watch a man with binoculars, and a long- focus lens -- until you can see the freckles on the back of his neck, and almost read his mail -- do you suppose it's ethical even if you prove he didn't commit a crime?
I'm not much on rear window ethics.

Of course, they have the same chance. They can look at me like a bug under glass, if they want to.

Jeff -- if anybody walked in here, I don't think they'd believe what they see.
Huh?
Huh?
You and me with long faces -- plunged into despair -- because we find out that a man didn't kill his wife. We're two of the most frightening ghouls I've ever known.
Whatever happened to that old saying "Love Thy Neighbor."
I think I'll start reviving it tomorrow, with say -- Miss Torso for a start?
Did Mr. Doyle think I stole this case.
No, Lisa -- I don't think he did.
I'll rephrase the question.
Thank you.
Do you like it?
Well, -- if there was one less thread this way -- -- and two less that way -- -- I might give up bachelorhood.
For a minute, Doyle almost had me convinced I was wrong.
But you're not?
But you're not?
In the whole courtyard, only one person didn't come to the window.
Do you think this was worth waiting all day to see?
Is he cleaning house?
Is he cleaning house?
He's washing down the bathroom walls.
Well?
It's just a picture of the backyard, that's all.
It's just a picture of the backyard, that's all.
I know. But there's one important change. The flowers in Thorwald's pet flower bed.
Something's in there. Those flowers have been taken up, and put back again.
It could be -- the knife, and the saw.
Wasn't that close?
Too close.
Suppose Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring was among the jewelry he has in the handbag. During that phone conversation he held up three rings -- one with a diamond -- one with a big stone of some kind -- and one plain gold band.
And the last thing she'd leave behind would be her wedding ring! Do you ever leave yours at home?
Jeff, if you're squeamish, just don't look.
Now hold on. I'm not a bit squeamish about what might be under those flowers -- but I don't care to watch two women end up like that dog --
What for?
Maybe I can get Thorwald out of the apartment.
I'll try to give you at least fifteen minutes.
How?
How?
Chelsea 2-7099. We scared him once. Maybe we can scare him again. I'm using that word "we" a little too freely, I guess. I don't take any of the chances.

Shall we vote him in, Stella?
Get an ambulance. Don't move. Try to lie still.
Lisa -- I -- I -- can't tell you how scared I was that you -- you might --
Lisa -- I -- I -- can't tell you how scared I was that you -- you might --
Shut up. I'm all right.
Shut up. I'm all right.
Think you've got enough for a search warrant now?

Feel okay?
Give me some dirt.
What's happening?
Good luck, Buzz.
You know something?

You watch too much television.
Hey, he's real abstract and different.
I'm cute, too.
Meaning me?

Chicken?
I thought only punks fought with knives.
Who's fighting? This is the test, man. It's a crazy game.
Machismo?
Somebody find him a knife.
You satisfied or you want more?
How 'bout you? Say the word and you're cold, Jack--you're dead.

What would you do, Dad?

I wouldn't do anything hasty. Let's get a little light on the subject.
Blood.
How'd that happen! What kind of trouble you in?

We'll make time. Where's some paper. We'll make a list and if we're still stuck then we ought to get some advice--
What can you do when you have to be a man?
Well, now--
Well, now--
Just give me a direct answer! You going to stop me from going, Dad?
Just give me a direct answer! You going to stop me from going, Dad?

Ten years? Now, Dad--I need an answer now!
Ten years? Now, Dad--I need an answer now!
I just want to show you how foolish you are. When you're older you'll laugh at yourself for thinking this is so important--
Go ahead.

Will you let him tell it!
She never wants to hear. She doesn't care!
Well, just get it off your chest, son.
That's not what I mean. I've never done anything right. I've been going around with my head in a sling for years...I don't want to drag you into this but I can't help it. I don't think I can prove anything by going around pretending I'm tough any more, so maybe you look like one thing but you still feel like another.

I don't think so--
Well--
Except yourself!
Will you wait a minute?
Will you wait a minute?
You don't want me to go.
You know you did wrong. That's the main thing, isn't it?
No! It's nothing! Just nothing! You always told me to tell the truth. You think you can just turn that off?
You'll learn as you get a little older, Jim.
I don't want to learn that!
Son--this is all happening so fast--
You better give me something, Dad. You better give me something Mom?
He depended on me.
And you can depend on me, son. Trust me. Whatever comes we'll face it together, I swear.
I don't see what's so bad about taking a little drink.
You don't?
You don't?
No. I definitely don't. I did the sa--

Let me just explain to you--we just moved here, y'understand? The kid has no friends yet and--
Was it because we went to that party? You know what kind of drunken brawls those parties turn into-- it's no place for kids.
A minute ago you said you didn't care if he drinks.
I guess when I nearly died giving birth to you--that shows how much I don't care!
Just relax, please relax!
No!
Did anyone see you there? I mean did they get your license number or anything?
Look Jim. Far be it from me to tell you what to do, but there's--
Are you going to preach now? Are we going to have a sermon?

Frank!
Stay here. That was my son!
John Crawford?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Come with me, John.
She keep it to protect herself, sir. She scared without a man in the house.
Where's your mother tonight, Plato?
They not together, sir. We don't see him in a long time now.
Do you hear from him, son?
Oh, Mrs. Crawford don't believe in them!
Well maybe she better start.
Do you know why you shot those puppies, John? Is that what they call you or do you have a nickname?
Plato.
Can you tell me why you killed the puppies, Plato?
No, sir. I just went next door to look at them like I always do. They were nursing on their mother and I did it. I guess I'm just no good?
No, sir. I just went next door to look at them like I always do. They were nursing on their mother and I did it. I guess I'm just no good?

What's the charge?

We're safe here. I hope. What do you think?
Wow! Well now-there-then!
Isn't it crazy?
Wowee ow wow! Let's take it for the summer.
Nobody talks to children! They just tell them one thing and mean another.
It's wonderful that you understand so well--and so young too! You know the most wonderful feature about the nursery?

I'm what? What?
Isn't he schizoid?
Hey! How 'bout that!
Haven't you noticed your personality splitting?
Not lately.
How do you know so much about this junk, Plato?
I had to go to a head-shrinker. I only went twice though. My mother said it cost too much, so she went to Hawaii instead.
I came here before.
When was that?
When was that?
When I was here? When I ran away. I used to run away a lot but they always took me back.

What you run out on me for! What you leave me alone for?
Plato!
I don't want you for my father!
Your father!
You crazy nut! You crazy, crazy nut!
Get away from me!
Plato?
I'm here.
I'm here.
Boy, I'm blind as a bat! You got a match? I'm going to break my neck in here. Where are you?

That's swell. How are you?
I'm fine.
You think the end of the world will come at nighttime, Jim?
No. At dawn.
No. At dawn.
Why?
Why?
I just have a feeling. Where are you?
I just have a feeling. Where are you?
Here.
Here.
Well, stop hiding and stand up. I can't talk to you if I don't see you.
I'm not going to hurt you. PLATO Why did you run out on me?
We didn't run out. We were coming right back.
We didn't run out. We were coming right back.
You sure?
You sure?
Sure I'm sure. Judy's waiting. You ready to come out now?
No.
I promise nothing'll happen if you do. You want my jacket? It's warm.
Can I keep it?
What do you think?
You want to give me your gun now, Plato?
My gun?
My gun?
In your pocket. Give it to me.
In your pocket. Give it to me.
I need it.
I need it.
You trust me, don't you? Just give it to me for a second.
You promised to give it back.
Friends never break promises, do they? Okay. Here. Now listen. There are a lot of people outside and they all want you to be safe. You understand that? They said I could come in and bring you out.

Why?
Why?
They like you. Okay?
They like you. Okay?
Come on!
Who's that?
Just a guard.
Just a guard.
I shot at one of them.
I shot at one of them.
But you didn't hurt anybody.
Those aren't my friends. Make them go away.
Ray! Will you tell these guys to move back?
Plato!
Keep away from me! I don't believe you anymore!
What?
Stop tearing me apart! You say one thing and he says another and then everybody changes back--
Stop tearing me apart! You say one thing and he says another and then everybody changes back--
That's a fine way to behave!
I'm sorry.
All right, darling.
Sit down and eat--you'll be late.
It'd stick in my throat, Mom. I'm nervous or something--
'Bye, Mom.
Goodbye, dear.
What happened, darling. We were so worried. I was going to take a sleeping pill, but I wouldn't till I knew you were home.
I have to talk to someone, Mom. I have to talk to you both. And Dad this time you got to give me an answer.
How!
It doesn't matter how. I was driving a stolen car--
It doesn't matter how. I was driving a stolen car--
Do you enjoy doing this to me or what--
Do you enjoy doing this to me or what--
Mom--I'm not--
Mom--I'm not--
And you wanted him to make a list!
I told you Dad, it was a question of honor. They called me chicken-- you know, chicken! I had to go or I would never have been able to face any of those kids again. So I got in one of these cars and a boy called Buzz got in the other. We had to drive fast and jump before the cars went over
Good Lord!
Good Lord!
I can't keep it to myself anymore--
What about the other boys--Do you think they'll go to the police?
What's that got to do with it?
What's that got to do with it?
Why should you be the only one.
No! I don't want you to go to the police! There were other people and why should you be the only one involved!
But I am involved! We're all involved, Mom! A boy was killed! I don't see how we can get out of that by pretending it didn't happen!
He's not saying that! He's saying don't volunteer!
Just tell a little white lie?
Well, it doesn't matter anyhow-- because we're moving.
No! You're not tearing me loose any more.
No! You're not tearing me loose any more.
Do I have to spell it out?
Do I have to spell it out?
You're not going to use me as an excuse again, Mom. Every time you can't face yourself you want to move and you say it's because of me or the neighborhood or some other phony excuse. Now I want to do one thing right and I'm not letting you run away. Dad?
Jimmy, you're very young--and a foolish decision now could wreck your whole life.
Dad--answer her--aren't you going to stand up for me?
Someone should put poison in her epsom salts.
Grandma?
Get lost.
Hang loose, boy. I'm warning you.
Hang loose, boy. I'm warning you.
Wash up and go home.
Wash up and go home.
Big tough character. You don't kid me, pal. How come you're not wearing your boots?
Too bad you didn't connect. You could have gone to Juvenile Hall. That's what you want, isn't it?
No.
No.
Sure it is. You want to bug us till we have to lock you up. Why?
Sure it is. You want to bug us till we have to lock you up. Why?
Leave me alone.
Leave me alone.
No.
No.
I don't know why--!
I don't know why--!
Go on--don't give me that. Someone giving you hard looks?
Go on--don't give me that. Someone giving you hard looks?
I just get so-- Boy, sometimes the temperature goes way up. RAY Okay. Okay. Let it out.
You feel like you want to blow your wheels right now?
All the time! I don't know what gets into me--but I keep looking for trouble and I always--I swear you better lock me up. I'm going to smash somebody--I know it.
All the time! I don't know what gets into me--but I keep looking for trouble and I always--I swear you better lock me up. I'm going to smash somebody--I know it.
Try the desk.
That why you moved from the last town? 'Cause you were in trouble? You can talk about it if you want to--I know about it anyway. Routine check.
And they think they are protecting my by moving.

You were getting a good start in the wrong direction back there. Why did you do it?

They think I'll make friends if we move. Just move and everything'll be roses and sunshine.
They think I'll make friends if we move. Just move and everything'll be roses and sunshine.
But you don't think that's a solution.
Things pretty tough for you at home?
She eats him alive and he takes it.
What a zoo!
What?
What?
A zoo. He always wants to be my pal, you know? But how can I give him anything when he's--I mean I love him and I don't want to hurt him--but I don't know what to do anymore except maybe die.

If he could--
If he could--
"If he could" what? You mean your father?
"If he could" what? You mean your father?
I mean if he had the guts to knock Mom cold once I bet she'd be happy and I bet she'd stop picking. They make mush out of him. Just mush. One thing I know is I never want to be like him.

I bet you see right through me, don't you?
How can anyone grow up in this circus?
You got me, Jim--but they do. Want some water?

Here. Look, will you do something for me? If the pot starts boiling again, will you come and see me before you get yourself in a jam? Even if you just want to talk--come in and shoot the breeze. It's easier sometimes than talking to your folks.

Cut it out now. I'm warning you.

Yes, ma'am.
Assault with a deadly weapon.

I tried to call you before. JUDY I thought so.
You still pretty upset?
I'm numb.
You cold?
Even if I'm near a fire, I'm cold. I guess just about everybody's cold.
Even if I'm near a fire, I'm cold. I guess just about everybody's cold.

No? Why not? You know something? Sometimes I figure I'll never live to see my next birthday. Isn't that dumb?
No.
No.
Every day I look in the mirror and say, "What? You still here?" Man!
Like even today. I woke up this morning, you know? And the sun was shining and everything was nice. Then the first thing that happens is I see you and I thought this is going to be one terrific day so you better live it up, boy, 'cause tomorrow maybe you'll be nothing.
I'm sorry I treated you mean today. You shouldn't believe what I say when I'm with the kids. Nobody acts sincere.

Awful? No. It's just lonely. It's the loneliest time.
Why did you do that?
I felt like it.

Your lips are soft when you kiss.
Where you going?
I don't know, but we can't stay here.

Listen! I know a place! PLATO showed me before. An old deserted mansion near the planetarium Would you go with me?
You can trust me, Judy.
I feel as if I'm walking under water.
Oh, Jim!
No--come on. Should we rent or are we in a buying mood, dear?
No--come on. Should we rent or are we in a buying mood, dear?
You decide, darling. Remember our budget.
Why don't we just rent it for the season?
You see, we've just--oh, you tell him, darling. I'm so embarrassed I could die!
You see, we've just--oh, you tell him, darling. I'm so embarrassed I could die!
Well--we're newlyweds.

There's just one thing. What about--

I love you, Jim. I really mean it.
No!
We have to go back!

No! I got to find him.
After he tried to shoot you?
He didn't mean it--we shouldn't have left him. He needed us.
He didn't mean it--we shouldn't have left him. He needed us.
He needed you, maybe. So do I.
You should have heard him talk about you tonight. Like you were the hero in the China Seas.
Sure. He was trying to make us his family.

They're killing him!
Is he your friend?
Yes. My best friend.

Well, that's the main thing--don't you think so?
Well, that's the main thing--don't you think so?
Maybe next summer he's going to take me hunting with him--and fishing. I want him to teach me how and I bet he won't get mad if I goof. His name's Jim. It's really James but he likes Jim more. People he really likes--he lets call him "Jamie."

Okay.
Don't give it a thought. Only three million dollars a month!
Oh, we can manage that! I'll scrimp and save and work my fingers to the bone...
Children? Well, we really don't encourage them. They're so noisy and troublesome, don't you agree?
Yes. And so terribly annoying when they cry. I just don't know what to do when they cry, do you dear?
Shall I show you the nursery? It's far away from the rest of the house. If you have children--Oh I hate the word!--or if you decide to adopt one--they can carry on and you'll never even notice. In fact, if you lock them in you never have to see them again, much less talk to them.
Talk to them! Heavens!
Plato, where's your father now?
He's dead. He was a hero in the China Sea. JIM You told me he's a big wheel in New York!

What makes you think he hates you, Judy?
I don't think. I know. He looks at me like I'm the ugliest thing in the world. He doesn't like my friends--he--
He makes you feel pretty unhappy?
He calls me a dirty tramp--my own father!

Do you think your father means that?

Yes! I don't know! I mean maybe he doesn't mean it but he acts like he does. We're altogether and we're going to celebrate Easter and catch a double bill. Big deal. So I put on my new dress and I came out and he--

That one?
That one?
Yes--he started yelling for a handkerchief--screaming. He grabbed my face and he rubbed all my lipstick off--he rubbed till I thought I wouldn't have any lips left. And all the time yelling at me--that thing--the thing I told you he called me. Then I ran out of the house.

Do you think you can get back at your Dad that way? I mean sometimes if we can't get as close to somebody as we'd like we have to try making them jealous--so they'll have to pay attention. Did you ever think of that?

Hi.
Didn't you forget something?
What?
You're too old for that kind of stuff, kiddo. I thought you stopped doing that long ago.
I didn't want to stop.
I was talking to Dad.
I didn't kiss her so it's a big thing.
I guess I just don't understand anything.
I'm tired, Judy. I'd like to change the subject.
I'm tired, Judy. I'd like to change the subject.
Why?
Why?
I'd like to, that's all. Girls your age don't do that. You need an explanation?
I'd like to, that's all. Girls your age don't do that. You need an explanation?

He'll be dead when he does.
Y'know something, baby? If you were my sister? I'd still want to wake up Christmas morning with you...

This is the front entrance, right? You get through the slots, you hit craps here, not blackjack. Blackjack's here to here -- lined up. What's this, the cage? Cage is over there, hard to get to, you got it all mixed around --
We walked the place for a week.
And I worked there. For a year.
They wouldn't have changed the security setup.
When I worked there, this was Bangs, office. Back here. He kept a little safe in the... uh, the wall, money held take for himself, skim from the Indians. Called it the... uh... ...the Powwow Safe.
So what the hell good are you...
You'd have to get me inside. Get inside, watch where the money's moving, see where the guards are going. Then I could work with your map.
You'd have to get me inside. Get inside, watch where the money's moving, see where the guards are going. Then I could work with your map.

Don't have Weather Channel in the Mountain, Nick.
A cowboy. You're going to send me into an Indian casino disguised as a cowboy. Have you thought this entirely through?
Put it on.
You're a country-western singer up from Nashville for the the holidays. Visiting your Grandma on the lake, driving into the Tomahawk for some scotch and slots. You only play the slots, you got that? Don't want no dealer friend of yours recognizing you, you sidle up to shoot some craps.
What kind of half-ass cowboy plays the slots?

Shut the fuck up. You play what your girlfriend plays. Ashley's going in with you. You talk to her, otherwise you don't talk to nobody. You walk the room as many times as you want, but the second you come out, I want to know the run of the place.
Do I get a country-western name?
You get recognized, convict, You get a country-western funeral.
Y'know what, guys? I woke up this morning, I got a really lucky feeling going on. I mean it, I'm feeling that good. I wouldn't be surprised if I walk in there, pull a handle and hit jackpot. Hell, we wouldn't even have to --
Get out.
You got one hour.
I'm gonna need some money.
Ten dollars? What do I do with ten dollars?
Don't tip.
Don't tip.
Monster. If we're working together here, we gotta be working together. I can't walk in there looking like the Lone Fucking Ranger with ten bucks to throw down. You don't want me getting noticed, right? Not getting noticed costs a guy at least a couple hundred.
A for effort, Nick, honestly, A for effort and an honorary degree. I'm surprised you never escaped from the Mountain.
...never... tried...
...never... tried...
Nick, here's what we're gonna do. In the spirit of the season, I'm going to give you a chance. I understand you're unhappy. Right outta the lockup, here against your will, it's the holidays and there's reruns on TV. So we're gonna have a contest.
Got something to say to me, Nick?

I been driving rigs a long time, Nick. Four, five million miles of road. Worked for people who wouldn't keep me on less I was driving fifteen hours a day. Tell 'em I needed sleep, I needed rest, shit, they'll hire someone else...
It's time for me... to be working for me. I want mine, Nick. And I need you. Did you tell your manager there's gonna be a robbery?
No, Gabriel... no...
Man, Monster... just... just don't start trying to hit me...

Across from blackjack, there's a security doorway. Keypad access.
What's the code?
What's the code?
Uh... they change it every month. I wouldn't know. If there's trouble on the floor, you'll get security coming through. what you gotta do, is get inside that doorway once they do. You gotta draw 'em out.
So. You're gonna need a man through here, two men at the cage, one to cover the count. You're gonna need a lookout outside, a sweeper through the back, and a gun guarding the front. You need six.
We got five. Putting Ashley outside.
We got five. Putting Ashley outside.

No, you're not.

There'll be people in that casino. I can't keep them from leaving if I don't get a gun. I don't need bullets, Monster... but I gotta be a threat.
No gun.
Well. What you guys have to plan out, then... is how you're going to get to that cage and that security level before anybody realizes anything's wrong. Running in with ski masks and bullets flying ain't gonna do it.
Well. What you guys have to plan out, then... is how you're going to get to that cage and that security level before anybody realizes anything's wrong. Running in with ski masks and bullets flying ain't gonna do it.

Here ya go, convict. We cased the place in the fall, got the layout down. What you're gonna do is show us where each of these doors go, what the upstairs level looks like, where they got the alarms, all of it.
And where they hide the real money.
Who's robbin' who here, Gabriel...
Get in there and watch 'em. Watch their every fuckin' move.
Where the HELL did he go?
Monster. There never was a structure change. This place was built the same from day one.
Mister. I'm begging, 'kay? I'm begging. This is not some card club, 'kay? This is the Tomahawk. We're an international gaming destination. We're in guidebooks. You can't do this... you can't do this to me...

What you gotta worry about first is the guards. Place doesn't look much richer than when I worked there, so let's figure you're gonna have to deal with ten of 'em. There'll be two on the floor, walking the room, that leaves eight up above. Eyes in the sky. They see something up, they're the ones who'll hit the silent alarm and you're fucked.
How do we take them out?
How do we take them out?
You gotta get someone upstairs.

What about the money?
You lock down security, you move behind the cage. You hit the Count Room. There'll be a guy in there but he's got no guns; room's accessed by another code. Cashiers'll know it. They'll have alarms.

So maybe after our week beneath the sheets, we'll head down to Motor City for New Year's. She says her roommate's skipping town for a few days, have the place to ourselves. Remember how her brother's a truck driver down there? I'm thinking he might be able to help get me some work.

Millie here used to serve drinks to these gunrunning truckers, real big talkers, talking bout a real score one day. I was in the Mountain, man, what the hell, why not let her get friendly with 'em? Let her tell 'em an idea she had, 'bout writing guys in prison. Getting one who could show 'em a sure thing.
She set them up. All of them.
She set them up. All of them.
Why not have her pretend to find me? Pretend to write me and reel me in? Tell her new trucker-man she'd pose as some sister of his named Ashley?

And you set me up.
And you set me up.
Always wanted to rob that casino, Rudy. Way back when I worked there. What better way than to get some guys to rob it for me.
Paid the Alamo ten bucks to put the shiv in me. He's a lifer, what does he care. Paid a hospital guard fifty to put out the story I was dead. Once the wound healed up... Got out of the Mountain this morning. And tonight I'm a rich man.
How'd you know I'd do it.
How'd you know I'd do it.
Do what?
Do what?
Walk outta there and tell her I was you.
Hell, you never needed to convince Ashley you were me. Just the dumb fucking truckers. I figured I'd talked enough about the Tomahawk in the pen for you to get by --
Talked about the old man's weapons stash, probably forgot I'd remember
Talked about the old man's weapons stash, probably forgot I'd remember
Hm. Well. They'd have killed you if you weren't me, Rudy. We knew you'd start convincing 'em soon enough.
They had the weapons and the willpower. We just gave them their inside man.
You gave them me.
You gave them me.
I gave them me. Said some nice things about me, Rudy. I appreciate it. But don't worry. I do love her. And she loves me. You had that right all along.

Who the hell made this map.
That's what it looks like!
Since when? What the hell is this room?
Map is kinda dirty, Monster...
They changed the layout.
Without having them hit the alarms.
I got an idea on that one. Once you're up there, you gotta hold those guards down till some backup can get there. There's a security camera room that videotapes everything. You've gotta destroy every last one of those tapes.
Alone at last.
Now where were we?
Now where were we?
I told you I don't know anything about any fucking set up. I've only been on the force eight months, nobody tells me anything! I don't know anything! You can torture me if you want -

Your boss even said there wasn't a set up.
Your boss even said there wasn't a set up.
First off, I don't have a boss. Are you clear about that?
I asked you a question. Are you clear about that?
Yes.
Yes.
Now I'm not gonna bullshit you. I don't really care about what you know or don't know. I'm gonna torture you for awhile regardless. Not to get information, but because torturing a cop amuses me. There's nothing you can say, I've heard it all before. There's nothing you can do. Except pray for a quick death, which you ain't gonna get.
How ya doin', Toothpick?
Fine, now.
Fine, now.

Now ain't that a sad sight, daddy, walks into jail a white man, walks out talkin' like a nigger. It's all that black semen been shootin' up his butt. It's backed up into his brain and comes out of his mouth.
Seymour Scagnetti.
Scagnetti? Oh shit, I hear he's a motherfucker.
Scagnetti? Oh shit, I hear he's a motherfucker.

You're coming back to work for us, right?
You're coming back to work for us, right?
I wanna. But I gotta show this asshole I got an honest-to-goodness job before he'll let me move out on my own. I can't work for you guys and be worried about gettin' back before ten o'clock curfew.
I don't wanna lift crates.
You don't hafta lift shit. You don't really work there. But as far as the records are concerned, you do. I call up Matthews, the foreman, tell him he's got a new guy. You're on the schedule. You got a timecard, it's clocked in and out for you everyday, and you get a pay check at the end of the week. And ya know
Holy shit, this guy's all fucked up!
No shit, he's gonna fuckin' die on us if we don't get him taken care of.
Jesus Christ, give me a fuckin' chance to breathe. I got a few questions of my own, ya know.
You ain't dying, he is.
You ain't dying, he is.
I'll call somebody.
I'll call somebody.
Who?
Who?
A snake charmer, what the fuck d'you think. I'll call a doctor, take care of him, fix 'm right up. No, where's Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue?
Let me tell you guys a story. In one of daddy's clubs there was this black cocktail waitress named Elois.
Elois?
Elois?
Yeah, Elois. E and Lois. We called her Lady E.
Yeah, Elois. E and Lois. We called her Lady E.
Where was she from, Compton?
Where was she from, Compton?
No. She was from Ladora Heights.
I don't know what he did to her, but she got even.
Was he all pissed off?
I don't buy it. It doesn't make sense.
It makes perfect fuckin' sense to me. Eddie, you didn't see how he acted during the job, we did.
The motherfucker killed Vic.
How do you know all this?
Joe, you're making a terrible mistake I can't let you make.
Stop pointing your fuckin' gun at daddy!
Daddy, did ya see that?
What?
What?
Guy got me on the ground, tried to fuck me.
Now Vic was tellin' me, he's got a parole problem.
Really? Who's your P.O.?
We can work this out, can't we?
This isn't all that bad. We can give you a lot of legitimate jobs. Put you on the rotation at Long Beach as a dock worker.
Didn't I tell ya not to worry? Vic was worried.
Me and you'll drive down to Long Beach tomorrow. I'll introduce you to Matthews, tell him what's going on.
Nuts. We got a big meeting in Vegas coming up. And we're kinda just gettin ready for that right now.
Let Nice Guy set you up at Long Beach. Give ya some cash, get that Scagnetti fuck off your back, and we'll be talking to ya.
Let Nice Guy set you up at Long Beach. Give ya some cash, get that Scagnetti fuck off your back, and we'll be talking to ya.
Daddy, I got an idea. Now just hear it out. I know you don't like to use any of the boys on these jobs, but technically, Vic ain't one of the boys. He's been gone for four years. He ain't on no one's list. Ya know he can handle himself, ya know you can trust him.
Daddy, I'm sorry, I don't know what's happening.
That's okay, Eddie, I do.
We were set up, the cops were waiting for us.
What? Nobody set anybody up.
What? Nobody set anybody up.
The cops were there waitin' for us!

I don't know, but somebody did.
I don't know, but somebody did.
Nobody did. You assholes turn the jewelry store into a wild west show, and you wonder why cops show up.
Brown's dead, we don't know about Blue.
Nobody saw what happened to Mr. Blue?
I take it this is the bastard you told me about. Why the hell are you beating on him?
So he'll tell us who the fuck set us up.
So he'll tell us who the fuck set us up.
Would you stop it with that shit! You beat on this prick enough, he'll tell ya he started the Chicago fire. That don't necessarily make it so. Okay, first things fucking last, where's the shit? Please tell me somebody brought something with them.

Well, let's go get it. We also gotta get rid of all those cars. It looks like Sam's hot car lot outside. You stay here and babysit Orange and the cop. You two take a car each, I'll follow ya. You ditch it, I'll pick you up, then we'll pick up the stones. And while I'm following you, I'll arrange for some sort of
What does it matter who stays with the cop? We ain't lettin' him go. Not after he's seen everybody. You should've never took him outta your trunk in the first place.
We were trying to find out what he knew about the set up.
We were trying to find out what he knew about the set up.
There is no fuckin' set up! Look, this is the news. Blondie, you stay here and take care of them two. White and Pink come with me, 'cuz if Joe gets here and sees all those fucking cars parked out front, he's going to be as mad at me as he is at you.
Go ahead and laugh, you know what I mean. What a while bitch will put up with, a black bitch won't put up with for a minute. They got a line, and if you cross it, they fuck you up.
I gotta go along with Mr. Pink on this. I've seen it happen.
The black Beverly Hills. I knew this lady from Ladora Heights once. "Hi, I'm from Ladora Heights, it's the black Beverly Hills."
It's not the black Beverly Hills, it's the black Palos Verdes. Anyway, this chick, Elois, was a man-eater- upper. I bet every guy who's ever met her has jacked off to her at least once. You know who she looked like? Christie Love. 'Member that TV show "Get Christie Love"? She was a black female cop. She always used to say "You're under arrest,

What the fuck was that chick's name? Oh this is just great, I'm totally fuckin' tortured now.
Well, whoever she was, Elois looked like her. So one night I walk into the club, and no Elois. Now the bartender was a wetback, he was a friend of mine, his name was Carlos. So I asked him "Hey, Carlos, where's Lady E tonight?" Well apparently Lady E was married to this real piece of dog shit. I mean a real animal. And
He's right about the ear, it's hacked off.
Let me say this out loud, just to get it straight in my mind. According to you, Mr. Blonde was gonna kill you. Then when we came back, kill us, grab the diamonds, and scram. That's your story? I'm correct about that, right?
Say "hello" to a motherfucker who's inside. Cabot's doing a job and take a big fat guess who he wants on the team?
This better not be some Freddy joke.

A undercover cop has got to be Marlon Brando. To do this job you got to be a great actor. You got to be naturalistic. You got to be naturalistic as hell. If you ain't a great actor you're a bad actor, and bad acting is bullshit in this job.

Well, I don't wanna do this, I have a bad feeling about it, but she keeps askin' me, keeps askin' me, finally I said okay 'cause I'm sick of listening to it. Well, we're

Mr. Blonde and Mr. Blue?
Crowd control. They handle customers and employees in the display area.
Myself and Mr. Pink?
You two take the manager in the back and make him give you the diamonds. We're there for those stones, period. Since no display cases are being fucked with, no alarms should go off. We're out of there in two minutes, not one second longer. What if the manager won't give up the diamonds?

When you're dealing with a store like this, they're insured up the ass. They're not supposed to give you and resistance whatsoever. If you get a customer or an employee who thinks he's Charles Bronson, take the butt of your gun and smash their nose in. Drops 'em right to the floor. Everyone jumps, he falls down, screaming, blood squirts out his nose. Freaks

Never ceases to amaze me. Fuckin' jungle bunny goes out there, slits some old woman's throat for twenty- five cents. Fuckin' nigger gets Doris Day as a parole officer. But a good fella like you gets stuck with a ball-bustin' prick.
I just want you to know, Joe, how much I appreciate your care packages on the inside.

That's great, guy, thanks a bunch. When do you think you'll need me for real work?
Well, it's kinda a strange time right now. Things are kinda -
Toby... who the fuck is Toby? Toby... Toby... think... think... think...
It's not about a nice girl who meets a sensitive boy. Now granted that's what "True Blue" is about, no argument about that.
Hey, fuck all that, I'm making a point here. You're gonna make me lose my train of thought.
Oh fuck, Toby's that little china girl.
Then one day she meets a John Holmes motherfucker, and it's like, whoa baby. This mother fucker's like Charles Bronson in "The Great Escape." He's diggin' tunnels. Now she's gettin' this serious dick action, she's feelin' something she ain't felt since forever. Pain.
Chew? Toby Chew? No.
Chew? Toby Chew? No.
It hurts. It hurts her. It shouldn't hurt. Her pussy should be Bubble-Yum by now. But when this cat fucks her, it hurts. It hurts like the first time. The pain is reminding a fuck machine what is was like to be a virgin. Hence, "Like a Virgin."
Wong?
Fuck you, wrong. I'm right! What the fuck do you know about it anyway? You're still listening to Jerry- fucking-Vale.
Fuck you, wrong. I'm right! What the fuck do you know about it anyway? You're still listening to Jerry- fucking-Vale.
Not wrong, dumb ass, Wong! You know, like the Chinese name?
Because you paid for the breakfast, I'm gonna tip. Normally I wouldn't.
Whatever. Just throw in your dollar, and let's move. See what I'm dealing with here. Infants. I'm fuckin' dealin' with infants.
But he's OK. If he wasn't OK, he wouldn't be here. Okay, let me introduce everybody to everybody. But once again, at the risk of being redundant, if I even think I hear somebody telling or referring to somebody by their Christian name... ...you won't want to be you. Okay, quickly. Mr. Brown, Mr. White, Mr. Blonde, Mr. Blue, Mr. Orange, and Mr. Pink.
Why am I Mr. Pink?
Why am I Mr. Pink?
Cause you're a faggot, alright?
Why can't we pick out our own colors?
I tried that once, it don't work. You get four guys fighting over who's gonna be Mr. Black. Since nobody knows anybody else, nobody wants to back down. So forget it, I pick. Be thankful you're not Mr. Yellow.
Yeah, Mr. Pink sounds like Mr. Pussy. Tell you what, let me be Mr. Purple. That sounds good to me, I'm Mr. Purple.
You're not Mr. Purple, somebody from another job's Mr. Purple. You're Mr. Pink.
Nobody's trading with anybody! Look, this ain't a goddamn fuckin' city counsel meeting! Listen up Mr. Pink. We got two ways here, my way or the highway. And you can go down either of 'em. So what's it gonna be, Mr. Pink?
Jesus Christ, Joe. Fuckin' forget it. This is beneath me. I'm Mr. Pink, let's move on.
Mr. Blue's dead?
Dead as Dillinger.
What's that?
I found this old address book in a jacket I ain't worn in a coon's age. Toby what? What the fuck was her last name?

How many employees?
How many employees?
Around twenty. Security pretty lax. They almost always just deal in boxes. Rough uncut stones they get from the syndicate. On a certain day this wholesaler's gettin' a big shipment of polished stones from Israel. They're like a way station. They are gonna get picked up the next day and sent to Vermont.

Like hell I am.
Like hell I am.
Joe, trust me on this, you've made a mistake. He's a good kid. I understand you're hot, you're super-fuckin' pissed. We're all real emotional. But you're barking up the wrong tree. I know this man, and he wouldn't do that.

You don't know jack shit. I do. This rotten bastard tipped off the cops and got Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue killed.
He was the only one I wasn't a hundred percent on. I should have my fucking head examined for goin' forward when I wasn't a hundred percent. But he seemed like a good kid, and I was impatient and greedy and all the things that fuck you up.
That's your proof?
That's your proof?
You don't need proof when you got instinct. I ignored it before, but not no more.
Don't worry, Eddie. Me and Larry have been friends a long time, he ain't gonna shoot. We like each other too much.

Because this guy's a fucking psycho. And if you think Joe's pissed at us, that ain't nothing compared to how pissed off I am at him, for puttin' me in the same room as this bastard.
You see what I been puttin' up with? As soon as I walk through the door I'm hit with this shit. I tell 'm what you told me about us stayin' put and Mr. White whips out his gun, sticks it in my face, and starts screaming "You motherfucker, I'm gonna blow you away, blah, blah, blah."

He's the reason the place turned into a shooting gallery. What are you, a silent partner? Fuckin' tell him.
I told 'em not to touch the alarm. They touched it. I blew 'em full of holes. If they hadn't done what I told 'em not it, they'd still be alive.
That's your excuse for going on a kill crazy rampage?

Bet your sweet ass we are.
I ain't going anywhere. I'm right here. I'm not gonna leave ya.
Larry, I'm so scared, would you please hold me.

What happened?
Blonde went crazy. He slashed the cop's face, cut off his ear and was gonna burn him alive.
Uhuh, uhuh, what's I tell ya? That sick piece of shit was a stone cold psycho.
You could've asked the cop, if you didn't just kill him. He talked about what he was going to do when he was slicing him up.
Have you guys been listening to K- BILLY's super sounds of the seventies weekend?
Yeah, it's fuckin' great isn't it?
Yeah, it's fuckin' great isn't it?
Can you believe the songs they been playin'?
Can you believe the songs they been playin'?
No, I can't. You know what I heard the other day? "Heartbeat-It's Lovebeat," by little Tony DeFranco and the DeFranco Family. I haven't heard that since I was in fifth fuckin' grade.
No, I can't. You know what I heard the other day? "Heartbeat-It's Lovebeat," by little Tony DeFranco and the DeFranco Family. I haven't heard that since I was in fifth fuckin' grade.
When I was coming down here, I was playin' it. And "The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia" came on. Now I ain't heard that song since it was big, but when it was big, I heard it a million-trillion times. I'm listening to it this morning, and this was the first time I ever realized that the lady singing the song, was
C'mon, throw in a buck.
Uh-uh. I don't tip.
Uh-uh. I don't tip.
Whaddaya mean you don't tip?

I don't believe in it.
I don't believe in it.
You don't believe in tipping?
I don't even know a Jew who'd have the balls to say that. So let's get this straight. You never ever tip?
I don't tip because society says I gotta. I tip when somebody deserves a tip. When somebody really puts forth an effort, they deserve a little something extra. But this tipping automatically, that shit's for the birds. As far as I'm concerned, they're just doin' their job.
I'd go over twelve percent for that.
Look, I ordered coffee. Now we've been here a long fuckin' time, and she's only filled my cup three times. When I order coffee, I want it filled six times.
These ladies aren't starvin' to death. They make minimum wage. When I worked for minimum wage, I wasn't lucky enough to have a job that society deemed tipworthy.
Ahh, now we're getting down to it. It's not just that he's a cheap bastard -
Do you know what this is? It's the world's smallest violin, playing just for the waitresses.
You don't have any idea what you're talking about. These people bust their ass. This is a hard job.
You don't have any idea what you're talking about. These people bust their ass. This is a hard job.
So's working at McDonald's, but you don't feel the need to tip them. They're servin' ya food, you should tip em. But no, society says tip these guys over here, but not those guys over there. That's bullshit.
Waitressing is the number one occupation for female non-college graduates in this country. It's the one job basically any woman can get, and make a living on. The reason is because of tips.
Fuck all that.

You even doubt it? I don't think we got set up, I know we got set up! I mean really, seriously, where did all those cops come from, huh? One minute they're not there, the next minute they're there. I didn't hear any sirens. The alarm went off, okay. Okay, when an alarm goes off, you got an average of four minutes response time.

Well, you better start thinking about it. Cause I, sure as fuck, am thinking about it. In fact, that's all I'm thinking about. I came this close to just driving off. Whoever set us up, knows about this place. There could've been cops sitting here waiting for me. For all we know, there's cops, driving fast, on their way here now.

Let's go in the other room...
What the fuck am I doing here? I felt funny about this job right off. As soon as I felt it I should said "No thank you", and walked. But I never fucking listen. Every time I ever got burned buying weed, I always knew the guy wasn't right. I just felt it. But I wanted to believe him. If he's not lyin' to

Okay, let's go through what happened. We're in the place, everything's going fine. Then the alarm gets tripped. I turn around and all these cops are outside. You're right, it was like, bam! I blink my eyes are they're there. Everybody starts going apeshit. Then Mr. Blonde starts shootin' all the -

But they didn't move in till Mr. Blonde became a madman. That's how I know we were set up. You can see that, can't you, Mr. White?

You're right, this is bad. How did you get out?
You're right, this is bad. How did you get out?
Shot my way out. Everybody was shooting, so I just blasted my way outta there.
Tagged a couple of cops. Did you kill anybody?
A few cops.

That was one of the most insane fucking things I've ever seen. Why the fuck would Joe hire somebody like that?

I don't wanna kill anybody. But if I gotta get out that door, and you're standing in my way, one way of the other, you're gettin' outta my way.

That's the way I look at it. A choice between doin' ten years, and takin' out some stupid motherfucker, ain't no choice at all. But I ain't no madman either. What the fuck was Joe thinkin'? You can't work with a guy like that. That motherfucker's unstable. What do you think? Do you think he panicked, or ya think he's just trigger-happy?

I think he's a sick fuckin' maniac! We're awful goddamn lucky he didn't tag us, when he shot up the place. I came this fucking close - to taking his ass out myself. Everybody panics. When things get tense, everybody panics. Everybody. I don't care what your name is, you can't help it. It's human nature. But ya panic on the inside. Ya panic

What you're supposed to do is act like a fuckin' professional. A psychopath is not a professional. You can't work with a psychopath, 'cause ya don't know what those sick assholes are gonna do next. I mean, Jesus Christ, how old do you think that black girl was? Twenty, maybe twenty-one?

Me and Mr. Orange jumped in the car and Mr. Brown floored it. After that, I don't know what went down.

At that point it became every man for himself. As far as Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue are concerned, I ain't got the foggiest. Once I got out, I never looked back.

No, they're not in the car. No, I don't have them on me. Ya wanna go with me and get 'em? Yes, we can go right now. But first listen to what I'm telling you. We were fuckin' set up! Somebody is in league with the cops. We got a Judas in our midst. And I'm thinkin' we should have our fuckin' heads examined

That was the plan, we meet here.
That was the plan, we meet here.
Then where is everybody? I say the plan became null and void once we found out we got a rat in the house. We ain't got the slightest fuckin' idea what happened to Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue. They could both be dead or arrested. They could be sweatin' 'em, down at the station house right now. Yeah they don't know the names, but

So who's the rat this time? Mr. Blue? Mr. Blonde? Joe? It's Joe's show, he set this whole thing up. Maybe he set it up to set it up.

Oh, you and Joe go back a long time. I known Joe since I was a kid. But me saying Joe definitely couldn't have done it is ridiculous. I can say I definitely didn't do it, cause I know what I did or didn't do. But I can't definitely say that about anybody else, 'cause I don't definitely know. For all I know, you're

Look, asshole, I'm right! Somebody's a fuckin' rat. How many times do I hafta say it before it sinks in your skull?
I gotta take a squirt, where's the commode in this dungeon?
Go down the hall, turn left, up those stairs, then turn right.
So, is he dead or what?

He scared the fuckin' shit outta me. I thought he was dead fer sure.
He will be dead fer sure, if we don't get him to a hospital.
We can't take him to a hospital.
We can't take him to a hospital.
Without medical attention, this man won't live through the night. That bullet in his belly is my fault. Now while that might not mean jack shit to you, it means a helluva lot to me. And I'm not gonna just sit around and watch him die.
