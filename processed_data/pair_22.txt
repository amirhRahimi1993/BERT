Deputy minister, what do you believe is behind this recent increase in terrorist bombings?
Bad sportsmanship. A ruthless minority of people seems to have forgotten certain good old fashioned virtues. They just can't stand seeing the other fellow win. If these people would just play the game, instead of standing on the touch line heckling -

Mr. HELPMANN, what would you say to those critics who maintain that the Ministry Of Information has become too large and unwieldy ...?
David ... in a free society information is the name of the game. You can't win the game if you're a man short.
And the cost of it all, Deputy Minister? Seven percent of the gross national produce ...
I understand this concern on behalf of the tax-payers. People want value for money and a cost-effective service.
Do you think that the government is winning the battle against terrorists?
On yes. Our morale is much higher than theirs, we're fielding all their strokes, running a lot of them out, and pretty consistently knocking them for six. I'd say they're nearly out of the game.
But the bombing campaign is now in its thirteenth year ...
Beginner's luck.
Thank you very much, Deputy Minister.
Thank you, David ... and a very merry Christmas to you all.
Thanks very much Sam.
That's all right Mr Helpmann. Glad to help.

Well, I ...
Sorry ...

I know he would have wanted me to help you ... And I promised your mother I'd take you onto the team at information Retrieval. But I gather that ...

I understand, Sam, I know exactly how you feel. So I brought you a bottle of barley water.

I did not get the wrong man. I got the right man. The wrong man was delivered to me as the right man! I accepted him, on trust, as the right man. Was I wrong? Anyway, to add to the confusion, he died on us. Which, had he been the right man, he wouldn't have done.

Sam, there are very rigid parameters laid down to avoid that event but Buttle's heart condition did not appear on Tuttle's file. Don't think I'm dismissing this business, Sam. I've lost a week's sleep over it already.

Tell that to the wives of the Security men she blew up this afternoon. Listen, we've also had a report just in from Central Services that Tuttle has wrecked an entire flat and sabotaged adjacent Central Services systems - as a matter of fact, in your block. I'd keep my eyes open if I were you, Sam. Bye.

It could all be coincidental.
There are no coincidences, Sam. Everything's connected, all along the line. Cause and effect. That's the beauty of it. Our job is to trace the connections and reveal them. This whole Buttle/Tuttle confusion was obviously planned from the inside. Bye bye.

27156789/074328/K.
Problem. She doesn't have a bank account.
Well, that's it! I may as well go and hang myself! This sort of thing couldn't have happened before the stupid seventh tier reorganization! That was Simmons doing! And he and Jeffries always sit together at lunch! The bastards! Ow! Perhaps we can lose it ... behind the filing cabinet ... or destroy it ... burn it ... eat it ...
You'd never get away with it. Besides, you can't do that to somebody's refund. It's Christmas. There is one more option.
What?
What?
Drive out to Mrs Buttle, give her the cheque, tell her to sign her name on the back, cash it at the corner sweet shop.
Here. What do I do next?
Call the motor pool and authorise personal transport.

Of course, of course. Leave it to me. How do I authorize a cheque?
Of course, of course. Leave it to me. How do I authorize a cheque?
Here we are. Pink and blue receipts. All you've got to do is sign these and the back of the cheque.
Oh God! I think I've broken a bone. What a pathetic thing I am.
Here.
That's it.
You are good to me Sam.
You are good to me Sam.
Don't mention it. See you later.
Is it all right about Mrs Buttle's cheque?
I delivered it.
I delivered it.
Can I forget it?

Yes.
Damn! Blast!

We're meeting Mrs Terrain.
Oh, to hell with the diet, a number eight, please.
A most perceptive choice, Madam, if I may say so. Monsieur?
Numero une, crevettes à la mayonaaise.
I'm sorry Alma, I didn't mean to sound so ...
I just wish you would stop interfering, mother! I don't want promotion. I'm happy where I am.
No you're not. Jack Lint is a lesson to you - he never had your brains but he's got the ambition. You haven't got the ambition but luckily you've got me. And Mr Helpmann. Mr Helpmann was very close -
Mr Helpmann was very close to your poor father. He was very close to me. Still is. He'll take you under his wing at Information Retrieval. You'll like it when you get there.
You're not listening, mother.
I hope you like it. It's very exclusive.
What is it?
What is it?
It's something for executives.
What were we saying?
This isn't rare!
This isn't rare!
By the way, I saw a wonderful idea for Christmas presents at the chemists. Gift tokens. Medical gift tokens.
Actually, Alma, that's one of the little things I was dying to tell you ... Sam's been promoted to Information Retrieval.
Mother!
Sam ... you haven't had dessert.
I'm sorry. I don' t want dessert. I don't want promotion. I don't want anything.
I'm sorry. I don' t want dessert. I don't want promotion. I don't want anything.
Don't be childish, Samuel. Of course you want something. You must have hopes, wishes, dreams.
Mother? Is that you?
Of course. Isn't it wonderful? The bandages came of this afternoon. Come and join the fun. Everybody's here.

Is Mr Helpmann here?

Yes he is - he wants to talk to you.
Yes he is - he wants to talk to you.
I want to talk to him.
It seems you're the first person ever to turn down a promotion. He thinks you should see a doctor.
Actually, I've decided ...
Sam!!!
Mother? ... What ... what's ... you've got to help me ...
Mother? ... What ... what's ... you've got to help me ...
Not now ... please
It's a refund ... I'm afraid there was a mistake.
Mistake?
Mistake?
Yes. Not my department ... I'm only records. It seems that Mr Buttle was overcharged by Information Retrieval. I don't think they usually make mistakes ... but, er ... I suppose we're all human.
My husband's dead, isn't he?
Er ... I assure you Mrs Buttle, the Ministry is always very scrupulous about following up and eradicating error. If you have any complaints which you'd like to make, I'd be more than happy to send you the appropriate forms.

Um ...
Uh ...
He hadn't done anything ... He was good ... What have you done with his body?
Really, Sam - when are you going to do something about these terrorists?
What? Now? It's my lunch hour.
Whatever happened to you?
There was a slight complication. Dr. Chapman says it often happens with a delicate skin like mine. Nothing to worry about. He's promised me I'll have these bandages off in a ...

Ah ... hello, Mrs Terrain. SAM lets go of the parcel and pushes JILL away. She moves off.
I think that'll hold it. Hello Shirley. Just helping someone tie up a Christmas present. How are you?
I think that'll hold it. Hello Shirley. Just helping someone tie up a Christmas present. How are you?
My complication had a complication, but Dr Chapman says I'll soon be up and bouncing about like a young gazelle. Are you buying a Christmas present for your mother?

Shirley and I come here regularly. I love romantic lingerie.
I can't make up my mind whether to have a number one or a number two. What do you recommend, Spiro?
Between you and me, Madam, today the number two.
Between you and me, Madam, today the number two.
Thank you, Spiro. Shirley, what are you going to have?

A little precaution, sir. I've had traps set for me before now. There are people in Central Services who'd love to get their hands on Harry Tuttle.
Are you saying this is illegal?
Well, yes ... and no. Officially, only Central Service operatives are supposed to touch this stuff ... Could you hold these.
... but, with all the new rules and regulations ... unncgh, c'mon, c'mon ... they can't get decent staff any more ... so ... they tend to turn a blind eye ... as long as I'm careful. ... Mind you, if ever they could prove I'd been working on their equipment ... well, that's a different matter ... up a bit with the torch,

Excuse me. You are a very kind man. I can see that. A man like you could not refuse a poor sick dying helpless man a small cup of water.
I can't. I have to stay with my patient.
See, I can't do it. I came out of the desert.
You came out of the hospital. You were tied down and hallucinating. You got some bad chemicals in your head, Noel. There's some medicine at the hospital that will fix that.

No, no medicine!
Noel, you didn't let me finish. We have rules against killing people on the street. Looks bad, but there's a special room at the hospital for terminating. A nice quiet room with a big bed.
Oh man, do you mean that? Thank you man, thank you. How?
Oh man, do you mean that? Thank you man, thank you. How?
Well, you have your choice: pills, injection, gas.
You're not going to die.
What did you say?
What did you say?
Shut up. You're going to die and he's not. Got it.
That's a hell of a swing you got there, Noel. I'm thinking Strawberry in his prime.
Strawberry ain't shit. Drug pussy. Me. I swing like Reggie. Mr. October. Number three, game six, World Series.
Here, you try.
No, I'd better not.
No, I'd better not.

Oh man, Bucky.
The pitch, high heater. Bucky knows what's coming. He steps in, smash, over the green monster.
Do you have any music?
What?
What?
Music. I think it helps if you play something he liked.
Music. I think it helps if you play something he liked.
John, play the Sinatra.
Is he going to be alright?
His heart's beating.
He's very very sick.
I know him. That's Noel.
I know him. That's Noel.
We'd better go outside. Quickly.
Is there any chance?
I guess there's always a chance.
I wouldn't do that. The doctor seems to think he's suffering from some rare disorder.
It's not so rare. He grew up on our street. He's had a rough life and he's a little crazy from it, but that's no excuse for not giving someone a lousy cup of water.
It's my first cigarette in over a year.
The first is always the best.
The first is always the best.
It's the waiting that's killing me, not knowing, you know? It's really hard on my mother. The doctor doesn't think my father'll make it. He says he was dead too long, after six minutes the brain starts to die and once that goes, close the door.

You never know.

I mean if he was dead, I could handle that.

At least he's got people around him.

I'm not so sure. My father and I haven't spoken in three years. When my brother called to say my father was having a heart attack, that he'd locked himself in the bathroom, all the way going over I was thinking how I was gonna tell him what a bastard he was. Then when I got up the stairs and we moved him onto

Even when you say the things, there's always more things.

Right now, I'm more worried about my mother than anything. They won't let her see my father.

Go home. Take her home. Get some rest. Not going to find anything out now.
Go home. Take her home. Get some rest. Not going to find anything out now.
That's what I told her. If she could just see him a second, then I could take her home.
You shouldn't smoke.
It's okay. They're prescription. Works better with a little whiskey.
It's okay. They're prescription. Works better with a little whiskey.
That's my brother's problem. He's passed out inside.
That boy you brought in, he was shot, wasn't he?
Yes.
Yes.
He's dead, huh?

Yes.
Yes.
I think this place stinks.

Did you see my father?

No.
No.
It's crazy in there. What's wrong with that doctor? He keeps mumbling, poking himself in the eye when he talks to me.

He's working a double shift.
He's working a double shift.
Thing is, I'm supposed to be the fuckup. The one on the stretcher in there--that's supposed to be me. With my parents crying out here. I got a lot of guilt, you know what I mean?
My father's in a coma, now my mother's going crazy. It's like she's in a trance.
She should go home.
She should go home.
I'd take her, but then who would stay here?
Yes?
Hello, I'm Frank Pierce, from the ambulance last night. I brought your father into the hospital and I just learned some news.
Hello, I'm Frank Pierce, from the ambulance last night. I brought your father into the hospital and I just learned some news.
I'll be right down.
He's better, isn't he?
Well, the doctor says he's showing some movement. It's still early, it might mean nothing, but I thought you'd want to know.

I was just going to get some food. Pizza. Maybe we could.

You can't kill my father that easy. He'll fight forever. Like with me: hasn't talked to me in three years. But it's okay. Sometimes you have to put things behind you.
Be tough to get a taxi here. We can give you a ride if you like.
Okay.
He wants to pull that tube out. It's pretty painful--that's why they keep him sedated--but it's a good sign.
You sure? I know my father would hate to be tied down. He wouldn't even go to the dentist.
That's how it's done. You have to keep the body going until the brain and heart recover enough to go on their own.
He's better, though, right?
He's better, though, right?
He's better.
He's better.
Look, I'm sorry, but it's important to me. I mean, a week ago I was wishing he was dead. And now I want hear his voice again, just once more-- you know what I mean?
My father was a great man, you know. There was nobody he wouldn't help. You know that crazy guy Noel who I gave water to last night? He lived in our house for almost a year. A total stranger he'd do anything for, his own family though ...
It's best not to ... It's good pizza, huh?

Not as good as Nino's.

You married?

Ah, no. I was. It's hard to explain. She had a hard time adjusting to, well, maybe it was my fault too.
It's been bad lately, but it's always bad.

Sure.
Excuse me. You seemed like you were in trouble.
I'm all right. I just can't stand to see people tied up. I'm in the waiting room for hours, listening to Noel screaming. The only reason he's screaming is 'cause he's tied up.

Don't say that. I wanted to cut my father loose too. They told me he almost died and five minutes later they say he's better and I go in. It's killing me seeing him fighting like that.

Okay.
I'm only asking because it's a dangerous building. There's been some robberies, a woman was raped not long ago. This woman I'm seeing, she'll want to talk to me all day, but if I can point to you out the window and say you're waiting, I can be out quick. if anything happens, I'll be in apartment 16M.
Maybe I should come up with you.

Mary. Mary, we've got to get going.
No, no.
You and CY have a nice talk? He tell you about Sunrise Enterprises, helping people? Well, I've seen him hurt people. Why are you following me?
Because you can barely walk.
What is it? You want to help me, you feel sorry for me? Keep it to yourself.
I need to sit down a minute.

I heard CY Coates was brought in. He looked pretty bad.
He'll be all right.
He'll be all right.
Too bad. He called me up today, can you believe that? I don't know how he got my number. He asks me do I want to come over and see him, I tell him I'd rather go to a leper colony. He says there's a new gang that wants to kill him, take over the business. I told him I hope he's right. That

I wish these people would leave already. I can't listen to another story. Did you see him? That doctor says the brain is coming around. They're waiting for the heart to stabilize. I don't know who to believe. He says they still have to keep him tied up.

Can I bring you something back to eat--a falafal, some pizza?

No, we just ate. I only remember how tough my father was. Now I know he had to be like that, to make us tough. This city'll kill you if you aren't strong enough.

He's not dead. It's a heroin overdose. Break out the Narcon.
He's dead unless you folks want to stop bullshitting me and tell it straight. Then, Lord willing, we'll try to bring him back.
I ever tell you about the time years ago I was on this ledge uptown, trying to talk this psycho inside?
Where the guy jumped and you almost fell. No, you never told me that story.
Where the guy jumped and you almost fell. No, you never told me that story.

Who's that?
She's the daughter of a cardiac arrest I brought in last night. I told her we'd give her a ride back to Misery. Her father's showing signs of improving.

Rule number one: Don't get involved with patients. Rule number two: Don't get involved with patient's daughters. You understand?
What about rule number three: Don't get involved with dispatchers named Love.

You don't know the first thing about rule number three, cannot begin to understand the complexities of that rule. Come on, let's go look at some hookers. The Kit Kat will be letting out. Don't ever call a junkie whore a crackhead. They get real mad.
Nice though, pulling back her hood as we drive by. There's a mystery to it, then she shows you.
She's no whore, Marcus.

We're all whores, Frank. You know what I'm talking about, the way she looked at me.

She wasn't looking at you, man, she was looking at me.
No, you didn't, Frank, thank you. But there's still a couple hours left on the shift.
I need a drink, that's all.
Look at that. A fat junkie. That's a first.
What's wrong.
It's coming. Hold her down.
What's that, Frank?

Three legs.

I don't want to hear about it, okay? That's three jobs for the night. It's over. Three jobs and time for a drink. Six am, the cocktail hour. Pass the bottle; I know you're holding.
I hate vodka.
Please, a little decorum if you will. What I was going to say is, is that holding that baby in my arms, I felt like I was twenty-one again. A call like that makes me think of going back to three nights a week, not two, start running again, cut down on the drinking.

You can't leave me now.
He got better.
I hate pronouncing people dead over the phone. Better, huh? They're fixed and dilated. He's plant food.
He one of them?
No, that's Noel. Used to be a regular off and on, hasn't been in in a while. He seized and almost coded--I gave him a hypertonic solution. He drank so much the kidneys were taking out salt. One for the textbooks.
That guy I brought in yesterday, post-cardiac arrest. He's gone.
Burke. You won't believe it. He's showing cognitive signs. He started with spontaneous respiration, now he's fighting to pull out the tube. Had to sedate him. He's in a CAT scan. I'm giving him every test I can: thromboytics, steroids, nitrodrips, heparin.

What do you think?
What do you think?
Who knows? It's all lower-brain-stem- activity. The heart refuses to stabilize--he's coded eleven times since he got here. This guy's a fighter. Every time the Valium wears off he starts yanking those restraints.

I wanted to bring them in, to see if he'd respond to voices, but they weren't in the waiting room. The guy's daughter was in my face all last night and when I finally have something positive to tell her, she's gone.
Oh Jesus, put her on the monitor. Where's the pediatric code cart? Odette give me that tube. All right, flatline--let's do CPR. step back, Frank. How many months?
Can't tell. It was a breech, twins. The other one seems okay, though. Marcus is taking him and the mother to Maternity.
You can't believe how much he's improved.
How many times have you shocked him tonight?

Fourteen. We finally got him a room upstairs. Should be up there in a couple of hours.

What do you do, just have someone follow him around with a defribilator?
What do you do, just have someone follow him around with a defribilator?
That's good, Frank. No, but they might surgically implant one, about the size of my thumb. It goes near the shoulder here, with two electrodes connected to the heart. It sends a shock whenever it senses a drop in blood flow. Amazing, isn't it?

He's dead, Rose. Your father passed.
How can that be? He was getting better.

Would you like to come in?
Yes.
It's not worth it, Tom. He's surrendering.
No prisoners. Don't worry, Frank, just a little psychological first aid.
I'm sick, Tom. I need a cure. Vitamin B cocktail, followed by an amp of glucose and a drop of adrenaline. Not as good as beer, but all I got.
Come on, Frank. There's blood spilling in the streets.
These are hard times, Tom.
Yeah. Great, isn't it?
Yeah. Great, isn't it?
Great to be drunk. Sobriety's killing me.

Ten-four. El Toro de Oro. Blast off.
The cure's not working, Tom. Maybe we should go back to the hospital.
Don't worry, kid. Tom'll take care of you. Put your head out the window, get some of that summer air. Listen to the music. El Toro de Oro. Andale. Pronto.
Tom, where are the Band-aids? This is an ambulance, isn't it?
Look out!
Where you going?
C'mon, Tom. The city's burning.
Whatja doing?
I feel the need, the need for speed. I'm driving out of myself.

I never felt better in my life.
Mr. Oh.
It's early for him.

That's all right, we're not meant to do Oh tonight. Something is going to happen. I can feel it.
Whadda we bring?
Better bring it all.
Get this, Frank--we got two patients. Number one, the scarecrow outside. Number two misses the railing but breaks both legs on the balcony, then throws himself through a glass window, heads to the bedroom, where he's now passed out.
Well, he's the steakhead of the night, then.

I haven't had a chance to see him yet. I'm going to take care of sleeping beauty.
Get ready, Frank. Missed a drug shooting while you were dicking around in there. There's gonna be trauma tonight!
As long as we keep moving. No standing still.

C'mon, look at your screen. Give up some blood!

You want some bum in the bus terminal? We'll wait for a real call.

Who with?

That's your job. Just keep driving, keep moving. No stopping. We're sharks. We stop too long, we die.
Let's break something, Tom. Let's bust something, bomb something.
What do you want to break?
What do you want to break?
I don't know--let's break some windows.
I don't know--let's break some windows.
Why?

What's the reason? Give me a reason, Tom.
What's the reason? Give me a reason, Tom.
Let me think.
This guy's been terrorizing the neighborhood for weeks, ever since he got outta jail, wreaking general havoc, contributing to the bad name of the place. The term "menace to society" was made up for him.
He's crazy. He can't help it.
He's crazy. He can't help it.
Well, why don't they put him away? Prisons don't want him. I took him to the hospital yesterday and here he is again.
Look at that. Tell me that's a crazy person. Every move is calculated. He knows exactly what he's doing. This is the guy. I've been after him for weeks. He's quick, runs like a rat, tough for one person, but with two of us--
Okay, whatta I do?
Okay, whatta I do?
If he sees me, he'll run, so I'll get out here. You start talking to him about baseball or something while I sneak around behind and get down and you push him. When he falls we get him.

Frank!

Do it!

Oh no!--I just remembered.

Coffee and whiskey, lucky you ain't dead with that diet. Wait, I've got it. Half fried chicken with fries. Let's go, hurry up. Come on.
Turn it off.
What?
What?
You know what. The radio.
You wanted it turned off. There's no such thing as a good fire. People get burned up. They can't breathe.
That's what we're here for. Come on, Frank.
That's what we're here for. Come on, Frank.
Don't push it, Larry.
Don't push it, Larry.
You're burned out.
Mr. Oh.
It's Mr. Oh. I'm not answering it.
Relax, it's a street job, easy except for the smell. We'll just throw him in back and zip over to Mercy--no blood, no dying, that's how I look at it. He's just a drunk.
It's not our job to taxi drunks around.

Someone's gonna die someday causa that bum, going to have a cardiac and the only medics will be taking care of Mr. Oh.
Well why didn't you say so?
He's drunk.
Faster! God!
Faster!
Larry, swing over on Eighth. We're gonna hafta run one of these calls.
Relax, will you.
I'm not feeling very well, Larry. I say we go back to the hospital and call it a night.
You have no sick time, Frank. No time of any kind. Everyone knows that.

You take things too seriously. Look at us, we're cruising around, talking, taking some quiet time, getting paid for it. We've got a good job here.
You take things too seriously. Look at us, we're cruising around, talking, taking some quiet time, getting paid for it. We've got a good job here.
Yeah, you're right.
Tell me, you ever think of doing anything else?
Sure, I'm taking the captain's exam next year. After the kids are in school, Louise can go back to the post office and, I thought, what the hell, I'll start my own medic service. Out on the Island the volunteers are becoming salaried municipal. It's just a matter of time and who you know. Someday it's going to be Chief Larry calling the shots.
He's crazy.
You really think so?
Jesus, Tom Walls, that crazy motherfucker.
Used to be my partner.
You're in the stomach!
You sure?
You're in the stomach! Let me try.
One more time!
Stomach again.
No way!

Zebra, are you there? I'm holding an unconscious at First and St. Marks.
No! It's three o'clock. That can only mean one thing.
Answer the radio Zebra. You know it's that time.
Four times this week I've had him. Aren't there any other units out there? Don't answer the radio. They'll give it to someone else.

Thirteen Zebra. One-Three Zebra. You're going out of service in two seconds.
Look, Frank, when I say don't answer it, that means answer it. You can do that for me at least. Three Zebra.
Yes, Zebra. You'll be driving to the man who needs no introduction, chronic caller of the year three straight and shooting for number four. The duke of drunk, the king of stink, our most frequent flier, Mr. Oh.
Yes, Zebra. You'll be driving to the man who needs no introduction, chronic caller of the year three straight and shooting for number four. The duke of drunk, the king of stink, our most frequent flier, Mr. Oh.
Ten-four. Don't go. Not this time.
Shit, shit, shit...
You're almost there, you can do it -- can do -- can do.
Okay if I watch you tape that interview downstairs?
Yeah.
One source referred to it as a five billion dollar metal sculpture to ugly to look at and too big to bury.
You write this?
...outlaw nation but strangely those who have interviewed Gaddafi find him, in a phrase we like to use in this country, very 'presidential'.
Nice, Jane.
Hi, Aaron...What's doing?
Same old stuff. I'm watching a man who won three Overseas Press Awards pitch an hors d'oeuvre idea.
You want to go out there -- get out of this for a second?
Why don't you lead? I'll just follow the flurry you cause.
What did I do to you?
You've made my dreams silly.
How <u>you</u> doing?
Great. Network news, Washington... I love it. What do you do when your real life exceeds your dreams?

You know the other day I really wanted your reaction to how we did with the Libyan report -- I was going to ask but I guess I feel a little intimidated with you.
You know the other day I really wanted your reaction to how we did with the Libyan report -- I was going to ask but I guess I feel a little intimidated with you.
Oh, stop it.
You can't talk about feeling intimidated when you're on top of the world. It's unseemly.
I'm not buying into any of that. I have a load to learn. I'm not going to act as if...
I'm not buying into any of that. I have a load to learn. I'm not going to act as if...
You have the job you have...
Shut up a second...

We're conversing...Oh my, the names of the entire Cabinet has slipped my mind. What are they?
Don't name them. Just tell me if you know.
Yes, Aaron. I know the names of the Cabinet.
Yes, Aaron. I know the names of the Cabinet.
Okay.
Yes.
There are only ten.
You're feeling good, aren't you?
I'm starting to... We may do the capitols of the states.

Fifty, right?
I'm in a pissy mood. I'm sorry.
What's wrong with it?
What's wrong with it?
Nothing. I think you really blew the lid off nookie.
This is uncomfortable for me -- because, well, I don't mean it as a knock, but we approach this differently.
We sure do. I don't mean it as a knock either. Go ahead. I'll just say what I think and you can disregard it if you want.
We sure do. I don't mean it as a knock either. Go ahead. I'll just say what I think and you can disregard it if you want.
It just might not work for me because of our different approaches.
Wait.

Your coat jacket is rising up in back.
I don't like being handled.
Sit on it! <u>Now</u> look.
Sit on it! <u>Now</u> look.
Just don't physically... Fantastic tip -- fantastic.
No. That's not going to tell us anything. Let's get this prompter going.
It's not loaded.

I'll find some copy. Be right back.
No. No.

Don't let your eyes go from the beginning of the sentence to the end like that. You don't want to look shifty, do you?

Oh, God, no!
Oh, God, no!
And the left side of your face is the good one. Go again. And try to punch one word or phrase in every sentence -- punch one idea a story. Punch -- come on --
You were smokin' toward the end there.
The pointers were great. I'll study the tape.
Everybody has one like that. I thought it was great when you started to laugh at the end.
Yeah -- well, I'm sorry I'm tying up Jane, I didn't realize you two would be going this late. Sorry.
Yeah -- well, I'm sorry I'm tying up Jane, I didn't realize you two would be going this late. Sorry.
No. Don't worry about it.

I'll put her on.
What did they do with you?
They booted me out of Washington.

Yes. And I'm sorry that they're sending you down for a while, but you'll make it back...Where they sending you?
Yes. And I'm sorry that they're sending you down for a while, but you'll make it back...Where they sending you?
London.

London. That's a promotion!
London. That's a promotion!
I don't think so.
I don't think so.
It is. Yes -- that's where they had Rorish, for God's sake, before they made him anchor. I can't stand it -- they're grooming you for it all and you don't even know it.

Hold it down, okay?
Hold it down, okay?
Can I ask you something? You only had one crew on the date rape piece, right?
Yes. You're not going to stick around for the farewell party?
No. I don't know how much fun it will be when Martin Klein and Ernie have to drop off their credentials with the security guard.
This story they won't cover. And if the network doesn't cover it -- it must not be important so why worry.
I'm going to miss you -- you're a prick in a great way...
You know what I...
No, I liked the way it made me sound. Okay. Be good. So long.
Hi.
Well, this kid couldn't possibly belong to anyone else. What's your name?
I'm just bringing him over to give Jane a look at him --
I thought she'd be here. I'll go with you.
I thought she'd be here. I'll go with you.
Okay.

I'll see you back at the hotel.

Hi. Turn on your TV... <u>Good Morning America</u>, the <u>Morning News</u> and <u>Today</u> are all about to talk to Arnold Schwarzenegger and I think he's live on at least two of them.
At six o'clock on the wake-up news they used the wrong missile graphic.

Now listen, Arnold just said that he's been making three million a movie now. But he's not ever gonna change. He's still the same person when he was making two million dollars a movie. He feels no different. He also bought a brand- new condo with Maria, they gonna furnish tastefully.

Okay, I'll see you in the lobbies [<i>sic</i>].
Where's where I asked him about being scared? You should work on your speech.
No. It makes me nervous to think about it. Let's do this.
He must have been great-looking, right?
Why do you say that?
Why do you say that?
Because nobody invites a bad- looking idiot to their bedroom.
Okay. Let's do me.
Sure.
Sure.
Okay. I feel like I'm slipping but do people who are actually slipping feel that way or is it always the really good people who are moving up who invariably think they're slipping because their standards are so high?

They didn't hire Peter Stiller from the <u>Times</u> and he had a great audition tape.
You want to start going over who they could have gotten? They can't take on people like this for network news. For God's sake. What's going on?
Nine seconds.
Eleven and a half.

Oh, God. Back it, Bobbie -- Bobbie?
I didn't sleep. They're giving me less and less air time. They don't think I'm at all anchor material.

I'll come by your place, right after...drink, take pills... Love you.
I think the pilot that shot down the Libyan in 1981 is stationed right here. Maybe you could get him -- and maybe Tom should say that our F-14 is one of the hardest planes to fly. They're nicknamed 'Tomcats'.
Thanks. The F-14 is one of the most difficult planes to master. Oh, you call them 'Tomcats' and in the 70's the first crop had a number of crashes.
Me again. Hi. Listen Gaddafi doesn't foam at the mouth or anything. When you speak to him he's not at all nuts. He seems like a leader -- very impressive, self-control...that's what's so strange.
Right and we have the '81 pilot on the way in -- Nobody else will have him.
Right and we have the '81 pilot on the way in -- Nobody else will have him.
You're welcome. Sow how does it feel to...I know you gotta go -- Me too. We're very busy here.
Well, whatever you think.
I figured out exactly why it is I'm so hung up on getting a chance at weekend anchor...It's because if I do that well, they'll pay me more, treat me great and my life will be better. That's why.

Which means I'm at their mercy and who wants that?...I'm not going to tell you where this thought led me... Anyway, well, why not tell you? -- it's a happy thing. In the middle of all this I start to think about something that does nothing but make me feel good and makes immediate sense and that's you ...And I'll stop here but, Jane,
You know you've had a strange day... I'd sleep on all these things you've been thinking.
Absolutely...You go have a good time... You have some place to go?
Absolutely...You go have a good time... You have some place to go?
Yes.
Yes.
Good.
Jesus, Jane. How long have you been here?
A long time. I was restless. Will you crack my neck?
Aaah -- -- ello. You sure they said the management meeting? They want me to be at the management meeting.
They're not that dumb, after all.
Tom...why don't I meet you there? I've got some last minute stuff I've got to take care of...Hey, how did you resolve your dilemma -- did you rent the tux or buy it...I knew it. How much? Wow...Okay...See you there...
I didn't know you were going with him.

Did you bring your grey suit?

Yes...I was thinking that way too... Which tie?

Could you at least pretend that this is an awkward situation for you -- me showing up while you're getting ready for a date.
Could you at least pretend that this is an awkward situation for you -- me showing up while you're getting ready for a date.
It's not a date. It's co-workers going to a professional conclave.
Because this is important -- so don't just be polite. I'd really like to look...what's the word I'm looking for?...
As good as humanly possible.

It was great...writing my little first rate copy, sitting on my jacket, punching my one thought. But I had this historic attack of flop sweat so they'll never let me another again. Oh, I lost one of your shoulder pads -- how was your evening anyway?

I don't know. At a certain point it was so off the chart bad -- it got funny. My central nervous system was telling me something.

I told what's his name -- Tom -- that I'd meet him.
Call him -- I mean it can wait, right?

I don't know. I may be in love with him.
I don't know. I may be in love with him.
No!!!!!
Don't go.
This is important to me.
This is important to me.
Yeah. Well...I think it is important for you too. Sit down.
What?
Let me think a second. It's tough.
Aaach...Jane... Let's take the part that has nothing to do with me. Let's let me be your most trusted friend, the one that gets to say awful things to you. You know?
Yes, I guess. Yes.
Yes, I guess. Yes.
You can't end up with Tom because it goes totally against everything you're about.
You can't end up with Tom because it goes totally against everything you're about.
Yeah -- being a basket case.

I know you care about him. I've never seen you like this about anyone, so please don't take it wrong when I tell you that I believe that Tom, while a very nice guy, is the Devil.

This isn't friendship.
This isn't friendship.
What do you think the Devil is going to look like if he's around? Nobody is going to be taken in if he has a long, red, pointy tail. No. I'm semi-serious here. He will look attractive and he will be nice and helpful and he will get a job where he influences a great God-fearing nation and he will never do an evil
I think you're the Devil.
No. You know that I'm not.
No. You know that I'm not.
How?
How?
Because we have the kind of relationship where if I were the Devil, you'd be the only one I told.
You were quick enough to get Tom's help when...
Yes, yes. I know. Right. And if it had gone well for me tonight, maybe I'd be keeping quiet about all this...I grant you everything but give me this...he does personify everything you've been fighting against...And I'm in love with you. How do you like that? -- I buried the lead.
I've got to not say that aloud; it takes too much out of me.
Sit down, stop.
Don't say anything about anything.
Hi. Will I ever sing again?
Bastard, sneak, quitter.
Speaking.
Speaking.
I just found out. You didn't say anything to me? You just resign? Will you meet me now? -- No, now! I'm going away tomorrow. Please.
Why not try it for a few weeks?
Stop. Ernie thought I was good too -- he couldn't help. My agent has a hot prospect -- the number two station in Portland. The general manager says he wants to be every bit as good as the networks. Personally, I think he should aim higher.

Ernie told this story. How he used to write obits and when the people in town called him up with death notices, he cried. He was till that way when they promoted him out of obits. He says you're lucky if you can get out while you could still cry. I should have quit this place three years ago.

You're just trying to say all great stuff so I'll feel even worse that you're not around.
Let's go...
I just want to sit here longer, I mean the feeling is powerful -- why's that?
I just want to sit here longer, I mean the feeling is powerful -- why's that?
Maybe the best part of your life is over and you don't want to get up and start the bad part.
You are now required to sit here with me. Come on...be smart for a second -- what do you think will happen to us?
Okay, that's very easy. Five, six years from now I'll be in town to collect an award representing the surge in foreign coverage by local stations.

You won't be able to stay mad at me, right?
You won't be able to stay mad at me, right?
I hope so... No. I'm not really mad. I'll miss you, we'll talk, we'll always be friends...we'll get hot for each other every few years at dinner and never act on it, okay?
I think so...They've been talking to me about being Tom's Managing Editor.
Really?
Really?
I'm going to take it.
So who's the guy?
Well, we met about three months ago. He works at the surgeon general office. He loves boating. So, he's been getting me into water skiing.
I like it! So, doll, what about you lately?
Well -- my wife got this new job...

In other times, for other purposes, there might be a band and bunting here at the bus depot for J.D. Singer's return from war. He...
Oh, you mean use him...That's nice. Okay.
I'll put him in the low corner of the frame -- good.
I'll put him in the low corner of the frame -- good.
In other times, with other purposes, there might be a band and bunting here at the bus depot for J.D. Singer's return from war. Last week he was decorated by a president for heroism in a war. But it was the civil war -- in Angola -- and he was in it for the money.
I saw the smile -- good piece.
I'm gonna go look at it again.
I had the strangest thing happen yesterday. Anne and I have been married what? -- Thirty-six years... Everything fine -- two days after the promotion came through, I was checking myself in the mirror and she was making a face at me behind my back. So yesterday I looked in the mirror and she was doing it again.
You didn't say anything to her?
That's it. I resign as of now.
Stop it.
Stop it.
I'll tell you what. I'll stay if Tom knows how to spell Gaddafi.
Oh, I was just writing you a note. What do you say we take a walk?
Outside?
Outside?
Yeah --
I don't know if we have any younger man more respected in our operation than you.
Just tell me what's really going on. I think we know each other well enough for me to expect that.
Just tell me what's really going on. I think we know each other well enough for me to expect that.
We know each other well enough for me to care how I put something to you which could wipe you out. So I will phrase things the way I think they should be phrased. All right?
We know each other well enough for me to care how I put something to you which could wipe you out. So I will phrase things the way I think they should be phrased. All right?
Wipe me out?
Anyway. I want you to think of this as...
Just blunt talk, okay? I'd really appreciate bluntness.
Just blunt talk, okay? I'd really appreciate bluntness.
Upper management thinks you're dull.
Aaron, I've never seen them like this -- I think Paul's nervous about his own job and for some reason he thinks you only appeal to...
Wait. Bullshit me a little...I'm beginning to appreciate it.
Wait. Bullshit me a little...I'm beginning to appreciate it.
I'm no suggesting the worst will happen...but someone with your brilliance gets nibbles about other jobs and maybe, the next time that happens, down the road -- you should look into it.

Ah, damn -- the fucking jerks -- My, God. They want to fire me.

All I know is that they've got to fire a large number of people... and they're not going by seniority. There's a recklessness in the air. They...

Do one thing to me? Get me one shot at anchoring the Weekend News -- they've never seen me do it. I think it could turn them around.

I could do it this Saturday -- everyone wants off for the Correspondents' Dinner.
Do it then.
Please prepare carefully. This couldn't come at a better time.
Please prepare carefully. This couldn't come at a better time.
Prepare what? You have Saturday's news handy?

It's been a while since you read the news -- I'll have somebody work with you. Just on superficial performance things.
Okay. I think I'd better be alone for a while.
I understand. I'll go with you.
I understand. I'll go with you.
Thanks.
It's what he did. I'm proud of him.
They told me they'd keep me because they could plug me into any story and my salary was in line.

The cost-efficient reporter.
The cost-efficient reporter.
So I quit.
Just a few questions?
No.
We came from Washington.
Move away from me.
Move away from me.
How long has it been since you've been home.

Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuckes. Snot... Fuckee. You want to use that?
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuckes. Snot... Fuckee. You want to use that?
It depends on how big a news day it is.
All this business of war -- do you get scared?
Uh-uh. I'm a little freaked right now about seeing my father though.
Okay. I just wanted you to know.
What is she shooting?
What is she shooting?
Norman Rockwell's 'Homecoming.'
Norman Rockwell's 'Homecoming.'
Oh, that's nice... We'll need some new lines.
Norman Rockwell's enduring portrait of a <u>Homecoming</u> The return of a fighting man has always been one of the more moving ceremonies of war... Tearful women, proud men, excited children. But J.D. Singer was right -- his homecoming was no big deal.
We have a minute and a half. It's my responsibility to tell them we won't be ready.
I was a little nervous there for a minute.
Oh, come on -- tell us another.
Goodbye, Paul.
Take care, Paul. It takes a certain kind of courage for you to say that in front of the President of the News Division.

You think anyone who's proud of the work we do is an ass kisser.
You think anyone who's proud of the work we do is an ass kisser.
No. I think anyone who puckers their lips and presses it against his boss' buttocks and then smooches is an ass kisser.
No. I think anyone who puckers their lips and presses it against his boss' buttocks and then smooches is an ass kisser.
My gosh, and for a while there, I was attracted to you.
Just when do you start, telling people?
Almost immediately.
Almost immediately.
I'd like to take everyone out after the show.
I'd like to take everyone out after the show.
Bill...This is hard on all of us and it's no time for compliments. But I think it's extraordinary of you to come down here for this.
Bill...This is hard on all of us and it's no time for compliments. But I think it's extraordinary of you to come down here for this.
If we're not here for each other during the tough time, we're not a news organization.
This is a brutal layoff...And all because they couldn't program Wednesdays.
You can make it a little less brutal by knocking a million dollars or so off your salary.
Jane?
Yes.
Yes.
Well, darling, if it gets any better than that, I'm going to have to bring you up here to New York.
Well, darling, if it gets any better than that, I'm going to have to bring you up here to New York.
Thanks. I just wish you'd kept the first twenty seconds.
But thanks.
Well, the visual with the boots at the end was just perfect.
Aaron should be hearing this so I have an extra witness.
Well, you always want to give the credit away, do you?
Well, you always want to give the credit away, do you?
No, I don't. He happens to deserve the credit. He's right here.
No, I don't. He happens to deserve the credit. He's right here.
I'll speak to you soon
You don't have time. Not a chance.
I'll be right down. It's right tight.
I've got to tell Ernie...because there isn't enough time.
Yes, there is.
What did he say?
I'll never tell.
Yeah, I know, I went back and forth on it.
I liked it. He's not afraid to be human.
Tell George and Jessica to try and cover everything without Tom having to ask additional questions.
And Bobbie says...
And Bobbie says...
Did you hear what I just said -- do you have that? Take a breath.
Did you hear what I just said -- do you have that? Take a breath.
Yes.
It's Aaron.
Yes?
Do you know you're the second woman in network news history to produce?
No, I'm not. I'm the fourth. Joan Richmond. Pauline Fredericks got that credit once on a U.N. special and there's Susan Zirinsky.
What are you dressed up for? Oh, that's right -- because the Evening News is here this week.
I spent a fortune on this.
They canned me. Well, my brother will feel great -- now he's not the only screw-up.
It's started.
Go back to 316, Bobbie. The sound bite in the cab -- it starts, 'I don't know how I'll feel...'
We could...
We could...
Please, Bobbie, we're pushing.
Play back the last line...
He said something about...
He said something about...
Let me hear it!
Okay, Bobbie, just a two-second dissolve to the Rockwell.
Should I...
Should I...
Just a two-second dissolve.
Do you want him all the way to the car?
No stop where he's all besieged.
No stop where he's all besieged.
Because...
Because...
Right there, Bobbie.
You know, I like Tom, because hi...
Bobbie, please.
They're not really going to call security are they?
No, I don't think so.
No, I don't think so.
How do I get out of here?
How do I get out of here?
Follow me.
Follow me.
You talked me into it.
I've been doing some morning show stuff, but mostly radio -- that doesn't bother me. I'm in no rush for anything. It's just the snotty attitude, even if I have it coming, it's still...
Bad manners.
Bad manners.
Yes. That's right.
Yes. That's right.
I know...I mean you didn't do anything special for me tonight. You just had what I think are good manners, decency. And it really makes me want to be nice back and it has nothing to do with any homosexual thing. Honestly. Because I don't know if you've homosexual or not and -- you're not, are you?
I know...I mean you didn't do anything special for me tonight. You just had what I think are good manners, decency. And it really makes me want to be nice back and it has nothing to do with any homosexual thing. Honestly. Because I don't know if you've homosexual or not and -- you're not, are you?
No...no.
No...no.
One's enough.
I really have to go.
Okay. At least let me show my appreciation. The Secretary of Labor is going to be indicted on Wednesday. For the graft thing he supposedly did before he was appointed.
Okay. At least let me show my appreciation. The Secretary of Labor is going to be indicted on Wednesday. For the graft thing he supposedly did before he was appointed.
What?
What?
Yes, it's true. They're going to make it public Wednesday but isn't it a big deal for you to have it a day and a half early?
Yes, it's true. They're going to make it public Wednesday but isn't it a big deal for you to have it a day and a half early?
Yes. How do you know?
Yes. How do you know?
My roommate's very social -- somebody from Justice was over and...I always hear things before they happen. Hey, and from now on, so do you.
...and the White House is hoping to keep a lid on it for a few days till they figure out what to do.
Thanks a lot, Buddy.
Thanks a lot, Buddy.
Oh, please. So they were really impressed with you at work.
Oh, please. So they were really impressed with you at work.
Not impressed exactly -- but a break in the clouds.
Not impressed exactly -- but a break in the clouds.
I see the change in you -- I see it.
Forgive me, but it really is intoxicating being a news source.
Nobody else had it.
Nobody else had it.
I wish it were you giving the story.
I wish it were you giving the story.
That's okay.
That's okay.
What if we just don't tell them anything anymore unless they let you do the story?
What if we just don't tell them anything anymore unless they let you do the story?
No. Really...don't worry about it.
No. Really...don't worry about it.
Okay. And look, in the future I can call you when I have news for you. Don't feel you have to spend time with me just to get the information. Well, that wasn't as hard to say as you thought, was it, Buddy?
Okay. And look, in the future I can call you when I have news for you. Don't feel you have to spend time with me just to get the information. Well, that wasn't as hard to say as you thought, was it, Buddy?
What do you mean? You're one of the few people in this town I can talk to.
Hey, Buddy, don't do that anymore.
Okay.
Is everything all right?
Yes. You didn't have to come here. It's just that I'm going to anchor this special report on this Libyan thing...
Yes. You didn't have to come here. It's just that I'm going to anchor this special report on this Libyan thing...
Anchor?
Anchor?
Yes, stop! I wondered if you could find out anything about what's happening. What's wrong?
Yes, stop! I wondered if you could find out anything about what's happening. What's wrong?
I broke up with my roommate -- He was really the magnet for everyone who knew anything.

Oh.
Oh.
Look, I can start up with him again if you really...
Look, I can start up with him again if you really...
No. I'm doing fine...Look.
Good. He's on the world's longest ego trip, let him take it alone.
Hey, okay. Look Buddy -- I've got to go to work.
Hey, okay. Look Buddy -- I've got to go to work.
...good-bye then.
...good-bye then.
I'll speak to you.
I'll speak to you.
Well, who knows. Just let m tell you what my favorite teacher ever, told me -- 'Don't be afraid to be wonderful.'
Ernie, they're calling from work.
Tell me I'm on the way in.
Tell me I'm on the way in.
It's Paul.
What?
They fired me.
How horrible. We'll be fine. You'll be fine. Stay here with me -- we'll go for a drive, have some drinks, make happy plans.
No. They're firing even more people than they said. Some will want to talk. It could help.
No. They're firing even more people than they said. Some will want to talk. It could help.
I could use somebody to talk to on a day like this. Sorry. Go ahead.
Bye, sweetie.
Okay, sweetie.
...am starting to get jealous. I read in the newspapers about the Italian strike and riots in Milan. I hope you weren't...
Honey?...
Jane -- For God's sake... Look, it's time for you to go to sleep.
I just have two more pen pals and then I'm done.
I just have two more pen pals and then I'm done.
You don't have to finish tonight.
You don't have to finish tonight.
Nooo. This way the rotation stays the same.
Nooo. This way the rotation stays the same.
Finish quickly. I don't want you getting obsessive about these things. Good night.
I don't know a recent Saturday I've sold more. You didn't think I'd sell that health restaurant, did you?
No. Not even you.
No. Not even you.
Why so glum?
Why so glum?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Go ahead.
Go ahead.
No, nothing. I've got a problem, I guess.
No, nothing. I've got a problem, I guess.
Were you bothering by those waitresses making a fuss?
Were you bothering by those waitresses making a fuss?
No. But, honest. What are you supposed to say when they keep talking about your looks? I don't even know what they mean -- "Beat them off with a stick."
You know, Tom, I feel a little proud when people comment on your looks. Maybe you should feel that way.
Proud? I'm just embarrassed that I like when they say those things.
Proud? I'm just embarrassed that I like when they say those things.
As long as that's your only problem you're...
As long as that's your only problem you're...
It's not.
I got my report card. Three Cs, two Ds and an incomplete.
Oh my. I see you studying so hard, Tom. What do you think the problem is?
Oh my. I see you studying so hard, Tom. What do you think the problem is?
I'll just have to try harder. I don't know. I will. I will. I will. I will.
Thanks, Dad, this talk helped. Will you sign it, please?
Would it help if I got you a tutor?
Would it help if I got you a tutor?
That would be great. It better help. What can you do with yourself if all you do is look good?
Tom isn't ready for the job you're about to hand him. Not near ready. Not by the longest shot. Aaron's spent six weeks in Tripoli, he's interviewed Gaddafi -- he reported on the Eight-one story. I think he's essential to do the job we're capable of and I think it's my responsibility to tell you that.
Okay, that's your opinion. I don't agree.
Okay, that's your opinion. I don't agree.
It's not opinion.
It's not opinion.
You're just absolutely right and I'm absolutely wrong?
It must be nice to always believe you know better. To think you're always the smartest person in the room.
No, it's awful. Oh my, it's awful.
I had no idea she was this good.
Fill for a second.
Hi.
I just wanted to tell you how great you were. My name's Tom Grunick.
I just wanted to tell you how great you were. My name's Tom Grunick.
Thank you. They hated me. I don't hate them.
Thank you. They hated me. I don't hate them.
Well, they say if you can reach even one person, it means something... And you did that.
Hi. I was worried I was early.
I was a lot earlier.
I kept thinking what a great break it was for me to get to see you tonight. More than a great break, maybe just what I needed...just when I needed it...Angel of mercy -- godsend...lifesaver...what?
I like "godsend."
I like "godsend."
I haven't been in news that long. I've just been looking for the right person to talk to. I have about two thousand questions for you.
If we could just eat first.
Totally understood. Totally wrong of me to talk shop after the day you've had. Totally sorry.
Totally understood. Totally wrong of me to talk shop after the day you've had. Totally sorry.
Nooo. If I could just have a roll, I'd be okay.
Another thing I can't stand is ...when White House reporters bullshit with each other after a briefing and then one of them has a theory and the other quotes it in his story as "White House" sources say...
That actually goes on...
That actually goes on...
Yes. My room is down here -- I'm not tired. Do you want to keep talking?
Yes. My room is down here -- I'm not tired. Do you want to keep talking?
Yes, sure.
Come on...Even I'm not that hard on myself.
No, I really got this job on a fluke and wait till you hear where it ends up.
I was doing sports at the station. The newspaper ran this untrue story that I was leaving and they got all these tons of protest mail. So they made me anchor.
So great -- right?
So great -- right?
Except I'm no good at what I'm being a success at.
Except I'm no good at what I'm being a success at.
How are you at back rubs?
Listen to me. You keep on thinking I'm somebody ho lacks...confidence. That's not it. I know I can talk well enough and I'm not bad at making contact with people, but I don't like the feeling that I'm pretending to be a reporter. And half the time I don't really get the news I'm talking about. It isn't that I'm down on myself. Trust
I trust you.
I trust you.
I didn't even have the chance to get really good at sports. I wasn't bad. I thought I was starting to do interesting features but hockey is big at the station and...
I didn't even have the chance to get really good at sports. I wasn't bad. I thought I was starting to do interesting features but hockey is big at the station and...
What about the obvious remedy? Reversing things. Maybe getting a job on a newspaper.
What about the obvious remedy? Reversing things. Maybe getting a job on a newspaper.
I don't write.
But that didn't stop me from sending out audition tapes to bigger stations and the networks.
Well, come on -- it is your life. Nobody is tying you to the fast track. Did you go to college?
Well, come on -- it is your life. Nobody is tying you to the fast track. Did you go to college?
One year...almost one year.
One year...almost one year.
So, you're not well educated and you have almost no experience and you can't write.
It's hard for me to advise you since you personify something that I truly think is dangerous.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
I agree with you -- you're not qualified. So get qualified. You can insist on being better prepared. You don't have to just leave it as... 'I don't write. I'm not schooled. I don't understand the news I'm reading. But at least I'm upset about it, folks.'
Whoa, this was a mistake.
Just what do you want from me, anyway? Permission to be a fake? Stop whining and do something about it.
I never told you the reason I was telling you everything for.
Hey?
Hey?
Those audition tapes I sent out... I've been hired by your network for the Washington bureau. So I'll probably see you at work. Sorry.
They said it would be okay if...
We're working here!! You can stand over in the uh, uh, uh...
I'm sorry if I was in the way. It was totally impressive. Great piece.
You weren't. Thanks. How does it feel being here?
You weren't. Thanks. How does it feel being here?
I can't believe I'm really here. No kidding. If you're through work now --
I can't believe I'm really here. No kidding. If you're through work now --
No. Aaron and I go to Central America on Wednesday -- so I'm cramming.
No. Aaron and I go to Central America on Wednesday -- so I'm cramming.
I thought you were incredible in there. I know how much I have to learn. I'd really -- a lot -- appreciate it...if...
I thought you were incredible in there. I know how much I have to learn. I'd really -- a lot -- appreciate it...if...
'Really a lot appreciate it...'
'Really a lot appreciate it...'
You make me nervous. Anyway if I can pick your brain --
I can't help you, sorry. I'm not here to teach remedial reporting.
And it has nothing to do with the fact I left your room instead of staying there?
Hi.
How's it going?
How's it going?
Can I buy you dinner sometime soon?
Can I buy you dinner sometime soon?
I just got back -- I don't know which end is up.
I just got back -- I don't know which end is up.
Okay.
So he was indicted?
Yes.
Give it to him -- so we can concentrate.
Ah, I don't want any credit. Bobbie and I serve anonymously.
I've got another story.
Some public official skipped a week on his Christmas Club?

The House Armed Service Committee has a secret report which says that the General Stillwell tank the Army has dumped a fortune into plain won't work. I have it cold, confirmed. They have five million dollars in this thing already.

Billion.
Billion.
Okay, billion...right, of course. They told me I could have any producer I wanted -- and I want you.
It's the firs time I've seen you dressed like this. You look so clean and pretty.
What do you mean clean?
What do you mean clean?
At work there's always this sort of film over you.
At work there's always this sort of film over you.
Well, thumps like me leave appearance to guys like you.
Well, thumps like me leave appearance to guys like you.
You're great at taking the edge off a good time.
You okay?
Yes. Just don't say anything mean for a while. Thanks.
Nervous?
Excited.
We're going to George. Say 'the Joint Chiefs are meeting -- we have George Weln at the Pentagon'.
George Weln is at the Pentagon where the attack launched by the lone Libyan pilot has resulted in a massive movement of military might.
You're an amazing woman. What a feeling having you inside my head.
Yeah. It was an unusual place to be.
Yeah. It was an unusual place to be.
Indescribable -- you knew just when to feed me the next thing, just a split second before I needed it. There was a rhythm we got into, like great sex.
You have to celebrate with me, don't you? Everybody's going to that bar on the corner, 'Caps.'
I'm going over to Aaron's. Maybe I'll hoop up with all of you later. How long do you think you'll be there?
Jane?
Yeah?
Yeah?
I'll wait for you till seven.
I'll wait for you till seven.
Okay.
I didn't think you'd make it.
Well, I thought I'd check if all of you were still here. I'll just go in and join the gang and you two go on.
Well, I thought I'd check if all of you were still here. I'll just go in and join the gang and you two go on.
There's no gang in there -- We were the last ones.

Well, I'll go in and have a bite.
Well, I'll go in and have a bite.
Jennifer, you want to have another drink?
Jennifer, you want to have another drink?
Hey, I know how to have a burger by myself. I feel like a little solitude.
Come on, I'll buy you a drink. There's a big thing over at the Italian embassy.
I'm not sure I'd be good company tonight.
I'm not sure I'd be good company tonight.
I'll be the judge of that.
It's much too soon for you to have this kind of buzz around you.
Do I have to stand here in the middle and meet them all?
Do I have to stand here in the middle and meet them all?
I'll get you through. Move and smile. And smile and move...
Maybe we could just sit here -- talk a little?
Okay. You didn't like the party, huh?
Okay. You didn't like the party, huh?
Too many smart people in one room -- it's not healthy...
I'm going to have to do a story from beginning to end on my own.
Eventually. Does it have to be right now?
Eventually. Does it have to be right now?
Believe me, I wouldn't be doing this unless it was absolutely necessary. I have an idea for something.
Believe me, I wouldn't be doing this unless it was absolutely necessary. I have an idea for something.
What?
What?
I just read about it in a magazine and it affected me.
I just read about it in a magazine and it affected me.
Well, what is it?
Well, what is it?
If I tell you, can you manage not to put it down or tell me why it won't work or is in bad journalistic taste or anything like that?
If I tell you, can you manage not to put it down or tell me why it won't work or is in bad journalistic taste or anything like that?
Yes, Tom -- I think I can manage.
I'm not sure I dialed right -- Jane?
Jane, yes. Tom? Tom, is that you? Is this Tom?
Jane, yes. Tom? Tom, is that you? Is this Tom?
Yes.
Yes.
I had to sleep fast so I took two allergy pills to help me...I'm sorry...Hey, you called me.
I had to sleep fast so I took two allergy pills to help me...I'm sorry...Hey, you called me.
It's not important.
It's not important.
Says who? Not important -- ha-ha-ha. I was dreaming -- Oh, no -- can't tell -- how embarrassing for me. Gosh.
Says who? Not important -- ha-ha-ha. I was dreaming -- Oh, no -- can't tell -- how embarrassing for me. Gosh.
What pills did you take? You sound more like someone on a general anesthetic. Maybe I'd better speak to you tomorrow.

Nooo. Is it your story?
Nooo. Is it your story?
No. Are you going to the Correspondents' Dinner on Saturday?
No. Are you going to the Correspondents' Dinner on Saturday?
Why, you need me for the story?
Why, you need me for the story?
No. Were you going to you?
No. Were you going to you?
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Maybe I'll get off work. I'd like to go.
Maybe I'll get off work. I'd like to go.
Oh, good.
Oh, good.
We can go together.
So you like me, huh?
I like you as much as I can like anyone who thinks I'm an asshole.
So what did you think?
It moved me. I did relate to it -- I really did. It was unusual for you to cut to yourself when you tear up -- and that might not have been my choice...but it's real and it got me...and I think a lot of the time I'm too conservative about that kind of stuff. Okay?

Yeah.
It's incredible who's here.
Who?
Who?
Me!
Suppose I go in for a little while and you wait in the lobby-bar. How's that?
Good. That's it...See you.
You're not going to take off on me, are you?
Uh-uh.

Great.
Why can't I let go of this woman?
Well...
At least kiss me when you do that.
You just can't stop editing me. Huh?
You just can't stop editing me. Huh?

I was half hoping I wouldn't have a good time tonight. You know why?
Because you're nuts.
Because you're nuts.
Right, right -- Isn't she fun to tease?
I don't remember saying anything like that -- exactly...I don't know why I just did.
Oh let's see -- wait a minute, well, I can think of two reasons.

That it would be a treat to make someone like you feel better... He gets like that sometimes.

Maybe I haven't been here long enough. But, hey, congratulations on the promotion.
How can you say that to me?
How can you say that to me?
Sorry. I can't stand here feeing bad that I don't feel worse. This has happened at every station I ever worked for. Look, I think it's crazy for you to come in here tomorrow and start a new job. I have a week to get to my job. Let's get the hell away to some island fast and find out how we are together
Well, I just think that' an extraordinary proposal.
That's yes?
That's yes?
That's more than 'yes' -- that's 'you bet.'
Then give me a minute...
You fucking...
Why?
I saw the taped outtakes of the interview with the girl. I know you 'acted' your reaction after the interview.
I felt funny about it afterwards. It's verboten, huh? I thought since I did it for real the first time -- but I get you. That's not the reason you're not coming?
Of course it's the reason. It's terrible what you did.
Of course it's the reason. It's terrible what you did.

This is a one-way argument. We've got six days; if you go and we fight and we hate it -- we'll come home. If you don't go? Well, that's a much bigger deal. I go to London right after that. So, it'd be very big deal if you stay here. The plane's boarding. You're good at deadline. Here's your ticket.

I'm leaving now. Gate 43.
That's not going to be the way we say good-bye. Even though I think what you did was rotten -- it's not all impersonal. You mean something to me.
You keep coming after me and looking down on me. It's starting to make me batty.
I don't wan to discuss work.
Well, let's do a special report on that...I mean that's news.

I knew what you meant.

Then you should stay here.
Then you should stay here.
It's better when you let me say it.
Take it easy.
Why did I have to do this to myself? Watch you take off. Call me if you need anything.
Well, why not? Hey, what is this? My life's rushing in front of my eyes.
A picnic?
A picnic?
I thought for ol' Cliff here -- Look at you? You're more adorable than your pictures. Look what I got for you.
What a great surprise. I didn't think we had a chance. I heard you wanted to stay in Washington.
Well, there's a guy, but he says he'll fly up a lot.

Okay...It's so good to see you.
This is very awkward.
Go ahead -- what?
Go ahead -- what?
Ummm -- it's dumb dorm stuff but I see Tom around you a lot and this is such a small office and I'd like to see him outside of work, unless there's some reason for you to mind... in which case I just won't do anything.

God Almighty -- Whew. Do I mind? Why do I mind? I do mind. What a shock -- I don't have a right to... I don't think I like him. I know I don't respect him...So what am I talking about -- what am I saying to you?

Right back to you.

I didn't have the guts to ask when I first came up. I'll get you a great tour.
The last time I was with someone we went through this awful mutual disease questionnaire but I guess it beats getting paranoid the next day. Okay, I'll go first. I haven't...
It would never occur to me to worry at all about you.
Where's the bathroom?
Through the closet.
I converted a bedroom -- this stuff builds up. Wait till you've been doing this sixteen years.
I'm not knocking it. It's a great solution. Not only the storage but you can see everything you have.
That's enough. That's enough.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Are you okay?
Are you okay?
Yes, I'm sorry.
Yes, I'm sorry.
Don't be silly. What are you sorry about?
Don't be silly. What are you sorry about?
The way you were looking at me, I just went.
I just need you for another minute now, so we can shoot from behind towards me, and, um...
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
...that way we have someplace to go when we cut. And I just sit here, I nod my head and look nerdy.
Don't you work here?
Not anymore!
Would you like to do me?
I just might.
I just might.
I'd be glad to help. For $50 an hour.
That's not true I am a sculptor!
Oh yeah?
If you were an artist you could have created something!
I'm going home!
What are you doing here?
I wanted to apologize for being nasty to you this evening.
Listen schmuck, why don't you get out of here and let me go to bed!
I didn't finish talking to you!

Yes. Fifty dollars an hour, right?
Yeah.
Tonight.
What, right now?
What, right now?
Uh-huh.
It's kind of dark -
Shh!
I'm almost ready -
Sit in this chair, and I'll pose you.
That doesn't look like very much clay.
Oh it's enough...
Oh it's enough...
Are you nervous, Walter?

N-no...
Not even a little bit?
I already told you I'm not.

When's the last time you had a totally nude girl in your room...
When's the last time you had a totally nude girl in your room...
Um...
Um...
Without a stitch of clothing on, sitting and facing you...
A girl with a body like mine?
You're breaking my concentration!
Walter can I ask you something?
What!
What!
Are you a virgin?
It's just an innocent question. Besides I just wanted to clarify your intentions.
Whaddya mean?
Whaddya mean?
Well I just wanted to make sure you know, fully and completely, that you're never gonna get any from me, at least in this lifetime.
Look - This pose is all wrong!
I'll pose any way you want.
Alright we're clear.
Anything new?
Anything new?
Not really. One girl who fit the descrip came in, kinda skinny, brunette, didn't see much changing hands.

What did he do?

He made a cat.
See you later -
Righto.
Don't worry about him...what have you got?
A thing I made.
I've never seen anything like this, maybe Segal, but nothing with such... dichotomy... It's very good, Walter -
Honest?
You really like it?
Of course...it's wonderful.
Great! What is it?
It's a...full length life-size figure!
It's a...full length life-size figure!
What's it called?

Murdered man.
It's called spontaneity, Leonard. Get with the program.
Yeah it was all just an accident.
Look at the size of it!
It's not really that big I got it on kind of a stand...

You can do anything you want if you set your mind to it.
Like it? It's a masterpiece. I've never seen anything like it before... and I hope I never see anything like it again. Walter smiles and looks at his creation -
Me too.
How did you ever find it all in yourself, Walter?
It wasn't easy.
Gee..twenty five dollars for something I made!
Now you're a professional!
Hi Walter.
Carla...
These guys came by to help me try out some of my new organic recipes.
Oh...
What's up, Walter?
I came over to see you. I brought something...I wanted to show you.
I came over to see you. I brought something...I wanted to show you.
Oh yeah?
Oh yeah?
Yeah. Can some of you guys help me?
Is it murdered man?
Better!
You think she's better than Murdered Man?
Well I can't say that Walter! She's incomparable. They're both great.
More champagne, your majesty?
Here here...
Where where...
There there...
May I please have another little kiss?
Walter! Jeez!
Walter! Jeez!
Sorry...
Did you hear what he said?
Yes Walter.
Yes Walter.
All about me...
It's true, isn't it?
Every word...
I know what it is to be ignored.
Tell us what you're going to make next, Walter.
Tell us what you're going to make next, Walter.
I'm gonna make the most wildest wittiest things you ever seen... gonna make big statues and li'l statues, tall statues n' short statues...
I mean, you look so pretty.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Ready? We've got plenty of time.
Ready? We've got plenty of time.
I know. But I wanted to talk to you.
Goodbye.
Bye!
Nice night out...
Hm...
Well...what did you want to talk to me about?
Well...w-what kind of people do you like, Carla?
Well...w-what kind of people do you like, Carla?
Oh, I don't know. Smart people. Creative people I guess.
Oh, I don't know. Smart people. Creative people I guess.
You think I'm creative?
You think I'm creative?
Of course I do!
Of course I do!
That means you like me!
I like you very much, Walter.
I thought you did on account of you kissed me the other night!
Well that was for your sculpture of the girl. Your nude in the chair.
Carla -
- even though Leonard's always asking you to go out with him and I - just -
What are you trying to say?
Uh... ...how long have you been thinking about this, Walter?
Oh...f-for a long time. Ever since you first came to the club.
But you gotta love me! Why do you think I made that statue of Alice?!
Walter, I'm sorry...
Walter, I'm sorry...
You just can't be sorry! I wanna - I wanna marry you!
Now calm down Walter! Now, let's go in there, and when the show's over, maybe we can talk about it.
No! I want to talk about it now!
No! I want to talk about it now!
Walter... I don't want to hurt your feelings but there is no way we're ever going to get...together. You know what I mean?
Walter... I don't want to hurt your feelings but there is no way we're ever going to get...together. You know what I mean?
Why not?!
Why not?!
Because... We're just friends. That's all. Just friends. WALTER I get it. I see the whole thing now. No one knows if Walter Paisley is born!
Because... We're just friends. That's all. Just friends. WALTER I get it. I see the whole thing now. No one knows if Walter Paisley is born!
Jeez, what is your problem all of a sudden?
Jeez, what is your problem all of a sudden?
Oh sure, let's string along poor Walter, see how far it will take us!
I'm sorry about what I said before.
Forget it.
Forget it.
I've been thinking... Carla, would you do one favor for me?
I've been thinking... Carla, would you do one favor for me?
Just about anything, Walter.
Just about anything, Walter.
Would you let me make...a statue of you?
Would you really like to? That would make me very happy.
Ok...tonight. I'll make a statue of you tonight, OK?
Walter...there's...
What?
What?
There's...a body inside that statue!
Walter...stay away from me!
Don't you see Carla? I made them immortal.
That's word for word.
Is it? I've forgotten.
Here you go, enjoy.
I hope this was made with egg whites!
I hope this was made with egg whites!
It was.
It was.
What's this sauce! I'm lactose intolerant.
What's this sauce! I'm lactose intolerant.
Don't worry it's a non-dairy sauce made from soy milk.
Don't worry it's a non-dairy sauce made from soy milk.
Hm.
Put it in the middle of the room!
When did you make this, Walter?
Walter...I can't believe it.
I'm honored to know this man.
Ah, your new head shot... I like it, very much...
Do you have to be so cold to him?
I'm trying to find a style of my own. Do you really like them?
Oh yes...very nice...very, very nice...
Hi Walter...
What are you doing here so early?
Maybe so...
I wouldn't give up your day job.
You've arrived. You've been recognized. You're a talent, a creative force to be reckoned with.
Leonard, what are you doing?
Are you trying to be funny?
I'm totally serious!
Murdered...man?...
When do we get to see it? WALTER Well...any time, I guess.
Are you alright?
Yes...I'm uh...I'm fine.
Yeah, I'm feeling a lot better.
Listen, I'm going over to Walter's after the place closes. I want to get a look at Murdered Man. Do you want to come along?
What's the matter with you?
Nothing...nothing at all.
Nothing...nothing at all.
I've never seen anyone so... squeamish. Well, what's your opinion, Leonard?
I've never seen anyone so... squeamish. Well, what's your opinion, Leonard?
Don't ask.
Don't ask.
Oh come on! Even you can see its value.
Well then admit it, it's a work of genius.
I admit it.
No. Why don't you cover it up Walter...
Why not?
Why not?
Why don't you cover it up, Walter!
What's wrong with you, why do you want to hide it?
Well, I've been thinking... I didn't realize how much...talent Walter actually had. It would be wrong for us to show them one at a time. Dead wrong.
Well, I've been thinking... I didn't realize how much...talent Walter actually had. It would be wrong for us to show them one at a time. Dead wrong.
You're right. We should build a collection first.
It will take years to make that many statues. But your work would be featured.
That's the idea, Walter. It's the only way to gain recognition. All the big art critics and art dealers would be there, it would be an event.
That's the idea, Walter. It's the only way to gain recognition. All the big art critics and art dealers would be there, it would be an event.
Yeah then you could unload - sell this stuff for a lot more.
Carla and I will guide you, help develop and evolve your work...maybe lead you toward something more abstract...
Abstract? With his talent for realism?
Abstract? With his talent for realism?
You see the direction his realism takes! It's unhealthy!
Would you pose for me for free?
Well, it all depends, Leonard...
It's our road kill series. I take the pictures.
I do the research.
Yeah, can you say plagiarism?
Not only that, he copied us!
Look at that, man. Big deal.
I know.
I know.
I mean it's like, you know, I do my art because that's what I am, you know? I'm an artist. I'm not like a banker, you know. Like I create.
I mean it's like, you know, I do my art because that's what I am, you know? I'm an artist. I'm not like a banker, you know. Like I create.

I wonder what his deal is.
I think he's looking for you, man... it's all finally catching up with you!
Man that's a trippy name, kinda like the Warhol mayhem series...
I saw a statue once called The Third Time Phyllis Saw Me She Exploded.
I saw a statue once called The Third Time Phyllis Saw Me She Exploded.
Now what kind of statue was that?

I don't know it was made out of driftwood and dipped in sulfuric acid. It was out there...
There's that weird dude again.
Man if this place doesn't cool out I'm gonna hang out somewhere else...
Man look at that get up !
Looks like that cat paid off in spades.
Looks like that cat paid off in spades.
Let's check out the scene.
Man if you want to be a legit artist you have to do nudes, nudes, nudes...
Right. Ain't no body of work complete without some... nudes -
Man this is heavy!
Yeah what's this, Murdered Elephant?
What did he say?
Didn't you hear him?
Didn't you hear him?
No man I'm on my own plane.
Man, why do you suppose Walter wants to get her alone? You suppose he could be physically attracted to her?
No man, he ain't the type. He don't get enough vitamin E.
No man, he ain't the type. He don't get enough vitamin E.
Maxwell gave him a bottle of wheat germ oil. Maybe he started taking it.
That's alright, we got a pressing engagement!
Yeah, right outside the door!
Walter, what are you doing?
I was just looking at Carla's picture.
I was just looking at Carla's picture.
Well that's not what I pay you for, now is it?
Well that's not what I pay you for, now is it?

Huh?

I didn't buy it I made it.
You...made that?
I said I did, didn't I!
Dead Cat!
Dead Cat?
Dead Cat?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well it sure looks dead enough.
You want to buy it, put it in the club?
You want me to buy Dead Cat? It'll scare people away.
Well...why did you put a knife in it?
I didn't mean to.
I didn't mean to.
Got carried away, huh?
Alright, I'll tell you what. I'll put it in the corner of the alcove. If it sells, we'll split it fifty- fifty. How's that?
Sure! So I guess that means I'm an artist after all.
All that is comes through the eye of the artist...
Alright get a grip on yourself Now since you're here why don't you start early, the kitchen needs cleaning.
Alright get a grip on yourself Now since you're here why don't you start early, the kitchen needs cleaning.
Sure!
People seem to like my cat.
Enough already about it - get to work!
Did you hear that Mr. De Santis? Everyone's really crazy about Dead Cat.
Yes they are, aren't they? Look, why don't you take the rest of the night off, you look tired.
Yes they are, aren't they? Look, why don't you take the rest of the night off, you look tired.
Well I don't know -
No, it's Ok...you came in early. Besides, you're creating an incident. When people are applauding they don't order anything.
Well...
Well...
Look, go home and...work on something. Make another cat.
Look, go home and...work on something. Make another cat.

Now why shouldn't you, Walter? Things are different now...
Now why shouldn't you, Walter? Things are different now...
They are?
Hiya Carla.
What am I doing? I'm just telling Walter the truth.
You know what that proves?
What, Mr. De Santis?
The question is what are you going to make next, Walter? Did you make that dog yet, or that parakeet? How about making something out of the cockroaches in your room?

I thought you believed that life is a homeless traveler riding on the RTD of -

Here here!
After that we go no more!
Hiya Maxwell.
I won't say good luck, Walter.
Why not?
Why not?
It would imply you could not succeed on your ability alone!
Why on Earth should you be so depressed? Have you heard some of the things they've been saying? You can make fifty thousand on these pieces alone!
I thought you didn't respect money!
I thought you didn't respect money!
I don't! But fifty thou? That's not money, that's manna!

Walter have you been talking to yourself again?

She doesn't have to be pretty... just as long as she takes good care of you...

Well why don't you clean up this dump!

What's the matter with you!
I don't think this is gold.
Not as single-minded as the others, not as sybaritic. Almost thoughtful. She's useless.
What's wrong with you!?!
My arm! He took my fucking arm!
My arm! He took my fucking arm!
Shut up! You let him have it!

I don't know. But the boy, he couldn't kill them.
No... Not a boy... Find out if they're dead. And do something about that arm. Honestly, I don't know how you made it through the Crusades.
I like it. Can I be your friend?
Stay away from my thang. Sorry, honey. 'Thing.'
Well, um... litter?
Litter, yeah!

Are there any good sicknesses that aren't too depressing?
Guys. The environment. I'm telling you, it's totally key. The earth is in terrible shape, we could al die, and besides, Sting's doing it.
Hey, I was thinking, for the dance, what about a big sign that says 'Don't Tread On Me'. You know, and a picture of the earth.
Don't tread on the earth?
Dying.
Eeyuu.
Hi, Buffy.
Hi, guys.

It's weird. I went back to my old grade school once, to the playground -- I used to hang out there all the time, playing on the swings and stuff... I went back and it was so tiny, the whole place. I couldn't even fit on the swings. Everything just looked so small. I'm sorry. I'm babbling.

Benny was right. You guys are all exactly the same.
I crashed your party.
Pretty shallow of you.

That's me.
That's me.
I'm glad you came.
I'm glad you came.
Yeah, you look like you're having a swell time.
Will I get the shit kicked out of me if I ask you to dance?
I don't actually think Jeffrey's gonna notice.
I'm going out the front.
Are you nuts, Buffy? There's a hundred of them out there. They'll rip us apart.
Are you nuts, Buffy? There's a hundred of them out there. They'll rip us apart.
You're staying here. Some of them might not come after me. If they don't this place is gonna turn into a total stain.

You say that like it's a bad thing.
Good thing one of us was prepared.
Buffy, there's no way you're going out there alone.
Are you okay?
Get away from me!
I didn't say it was a bad idea, I just said the timing was off. We could maybe wait till later.
Don't be such a fraidy-cat.

You're the boss, boss. I just thought maybe we should wait.
It has to be, like a socially conscious theme.
'One that reflects the students' growing awareness of and involvement in the world around them.'
It is a pretty crucial subject.
See, Cassandra likes it. Cassandra's my friend.
Bugs.
Okay, guys, how about the ozone layer?
Can't. History report. The Normans and the Saxons.
Bogutude. Blow it off.
Bogutude. Blow it off.
I really can't. Besides, it's pretty interesting.

Well, where?
Beverly Center.

Totally stale. And the ushers are like, the acne patrol. We're thinking Pavilion. Sitch?
Sounds toasty. We're going Pavilion.
Excuse much! Not rude or anything.
Nice ensemble!
What did Jeffrey's dad say?
'Just remember you're in training, son'
Let's meet tonight, okay?
Where?
Where?
Cafe Blase.
I don't see why we have to invite everyone.
Kimberly, it's the senior dance.
I didn't learn... I just... it's not a big deal.
Buffy, I'm gonna tell Jeffrey you were playing with another man's Hebrew National.

Oh my God you're having an affair.
Excuse me for having something important to do.
This isn't important? The earth is our home.
This isn't important? The earth is our home.
Kimberly, it's a dance. It's a stupid dance with a bunch of stupid kids that I see every stupid day.
Listen to you. What language are you speaking?
Get out of my facial.
I'm glad you guys are here. It's good to see you.
Yeah, whoops I came.
Yeah, whoops I came.
You look way pretty, Kim.

I know. I like your little outfit.
God, where the hell did you come from? You scared me to death.

I'm looking for you, actually.
I'm looking for you, actually.
Am I in trouble or something?
Am I in trouble or something?
Not at all. My name is Merrick. I was sent to find you some time ago. I should have found you much sooner but there were... complications. You should have been taught, prepared.

I've searched the entire world for you, Buffy.
I've searched the entire world for you, Buffy.
Why?
Why?
To bring you... your birthright.
To bring you... your birthright.
My birthright? You mean, like a trust fund?
I had a trust fund my great- grandfather, or maybe it was an inheritance, 'cause he's dead, and I spent it on shoes.
You must come with me. It's much too late already. You must come with me to the graveyard.

I don't have time for your prattling. I have proof. You bear the mark.
Just stay away from me, okay?
Did you ever dream that you were someone else?
Everybody does.
In the past. A girl. Maybe... A Magyar peasant. An Indian princess. A slave.
I was a slave.
In Virginia.

I don't know. It was... There was a big gram or something. And there's one, I'm like a prostitute...

China.
China.
Oh, my God. I never told anybody about this. I remember the one about the peasant, too. God, there's a bunch. Is this, like channeling or something.
I had a dream once where I was... There was like, knights in it, and I worked in this bar. And I... was fighting. I'm always fighting. And there's a guy... He's not always there, but he's horrible, all white, and he's always... trying to kill me.
Lothos.
How do you know all this?
I have to show you.
I can't believe I'm doing this. I can't believe I'm in a graveyard with a strange man hunting for vampires on a school night.
Why didn't you ever tell anybody about your dreams?

Oh, yeah, tell everyone I'm crazy. Beauty ida.
Ow.

All right. What do we do now?
All right. What do we do now?
We wait for Robert to wake up.
Where's the other one?
She --
Go to school tomorrow. Try to act normal. Don't let anyone know what's happening. This is important. When the vampires find out who you are... you won't be hunting them anymore.
All right.
Meet me at this address after school.
I have cheerleading squad.
I have cheerleading squad.
Skip it.
They can't come in, right? Unless you invite them. Is that true?
It's true.
It's not pretty, but it does suit our purposes.

Oh, him.
Oh, him.
Yes. They travel about, usually with one or two of their followers to lay the groundwork. The vampires find a community and they feed on it, make it their own. You were difficult to trace, and I think the process has gone a lot further than I'd anticipated. Usually this goads a community into some kind of paranoid frenzy. But for some reason, nobody

We're going to have the work hard. You'll need some excuse for staying out. For your parents.
Not a pressing issue.
I tell you, the best thing I can do right now is find out more about you. What your strengths are, your likes... Everything. What's your best subject?

I don't want to be the chosen one, okay? I don't want to spend the rest of my life chasing after vampires! I just want to graduate from high school, go to Europe, marry Charlie Sheen and die. It may not sound too exciting to a sconehead like you, but I think it's swell. And then you come along... and... and then I'm a

Last night. You knew I was sitting on a fresh grave, didn't you?
I don't think you understand the full implications of --
Oh. Sorry.
Don't you see what's happening? You're changing. You've got powers you've only just begun to tap. Physical, mental prowess you've never dreamed of. God, this hurts. I've administered a few shocks to your system to start the adrenaline working. I'm sorry I have to take so many shortcuts in the training process.

No... I guess I would have gotten Jeffrey to hit you.

Exactly. You're changing. You're becoming something extraordinarily powerful.
Ooh, another embarrassment for the teabag, while the chosen one is still well under par.
Your turn.
What about bats? Do they turn into bats?
No. No bats, no flying. They... float, occasionally. Not really flying.

Same one.

What!?!
Try to pay attention.
He was slow. Very simple. They won't all be that easy.
Fine.
Fine.
And the alley was a mistake. Never corner yourself like that. If they'd come at you in force you'd be dead now. One vampire is a lot easier to kill then ten.

Nice conversationalist! Yeah, I felt 'em a little, but I ain't due for two weeks since you're so excited about the subject.

Do you know how many girls I've trained to be Slayers? Five. Five properly prepared girls, girls who faced their responsibilities, who worked hard to become women overnight -- harder than you've ever worked in your life -- and I saw them ripped apart. Do you want to live? Do you?
I...
I...
What did you think, that being able to jump about and hit people makes you a Slayer?
Five?

There's a small village in Hampshire, near Stonehenge... ... near a bunch of big rocks. That's where I was born. My father taught me about the training, about finding the Slayers, reading the signs.

Merrick. You made a joke. Are you okay, I mean, do you want to lie down? I know it hurts the first time.
I mean, most of the time Jeffrey's really sweet, but sometimes he gets kind of... 'Me-Tarzan'ish, you know what I mean? Lately it bugs me, I guess. Merrick? Are you still breathing?

Okay. The important thing is not to panic.
Interesting.
I kind of had to improvise. Sorry about your guitar.
There isn't time.
Make time, okay? You're the one who told me to act normal. I've missed three practices already. If I'm not there for the Barber game tomorrow everyone's gonna talk.

None of the other girls ever gave me this much trouble.
And where are they now?
Wait!
He knows who I am!
Mr. Howard is so heinous. He's always giving me a hard time. I get a C-plus on the test and he tells me, 'You have no sense of history.' I have no sense of history? He wears a brown tie.
You got a C-plus? I can't believe I cheated off you.

Excuse me for not knowing about El Salvador. Like I'm ever going to Spain anyway. Ooh!
No THX.
They don't even have Dolby.
So, is Jeffrey really spending the night at your house?
That's the plan.
That's the plan.
Good enough!
Cool. We can figure decorations and stuff.
Cassandra, you gotta come, too.
Come one, that was so weird.
What, it's not weird. I just cut the stupid hot dog in half.
-- like she's gonna kill me.
I was just scared is all.
I was just scared is all.
No. It was mondo bizarro.
That is so cool.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
Nobody is even gonna look at the game.
I don't get it.
How do you not tread on the earth? I mean, you kind of have to.
You guys blow. I'm waiting on Cassandra. She's gonna help me with my history.
Cassandra's really smart.
Cassandra's really smart.
Yeah... She's okay, though.

I guess.
Don't worry, Jennifer. Someday your prince will come.
Yeah, just make sure you do first. Let's go, guys.
Yeah, just make sure you do first. Let's go, guys.
B'bye.
Hey, Buffers. You look thrashed.
Thanks.
Thanks.
You and Cassandra get anything done last night?
Buffy, Jesus! You know these steps.
Sorry.
Pike.
You're having a fling with him?
Well, I guess you got what you came for.
Nicole...
Nicole...
Later for it.
Hi, guys.
Hi.
Hi.
Have you guys seen Jeffrey? The limo never showed, I thought he might be here.
I haven't seen him tonight.
Oh.
I find it restorative, sleeping in the life-blood of so many. To feel their souls coursing about me.
What's happening? What do you want?
What's happening? What do you want?
So very much.
So very much.
My parents have money...
My parents have money...
Yes, I'm sure they do. This place is everything you said it was, Amilyn.
What... are you?
Are we so strange? So alien to you? I've seen this culture, the wealth, the greed, the waste... it's truly heartwarming. The perfect place to spread my empire. Honestly, Eastern Europe was so dead, the Communists just drained the blood out of the place. It's livened up a bit in the past few years, but it's nothing compared to this.... this Mecca of consumption.
No, wait. I can be dumb. Really. Or mean, or whatever. I can learn. I'm useful.
Really?
Really?
Swear to God.
I can't!
You know you must. There is only one. Now you are that one. It is time.
You know you must. There is only one. Now you are that one. It is time.
Why? Why me?
Why? Why me?
She has died. You are the next to be called. Why do you think you were sent to me? Trained as you were? You bear the mark.
The mark of the Coven.
I don't understand.
I don't understand.
Ever since Adam and Eve first left the garden, he followed: the serpent. Satan. He sends his legion in the shape of men, to feed on us, to breed his Hell on our earth. They are a plague upon us.
But as long as there have been vampire, there has been the Coven; the line of Slayers. Ones with the strength and the skill to kill them, to find them where they gather and stop the swell of their numbers. One dies, the next is called.
I'm just a girl.
I'm just a girl.
You are much more.

Hi, Grueller.
Hi, Grueller.
What are you grinning at? You think I was scared?

Got that.
Got that.
Good.
Write that down.
Okay, what else?
Oh, yes! Yes!
Oh, baby!
Oh, baby!
Make me a woman! Yes! Make me a woman!
Buffy?
Jeffrey!
Well, I'm done. Are you done?
No --
No --
Okay, let's go.
Okay, let's go.
But --
She didn't even hardly talk to anyone in school. All year. She didn't even go to the prom.
I heard she got straight A's.
I can't believe they still ate it.
Where'd you learn how to do that?
So they found Cassandra's body out by the railway tunnels. Nobody's saying anything, but they think she was involved in something, like, illegal or something. Like dealing.
Well, I hope so.
Well, I hope so.
Probably was. What do you suppose she was doing out there.
I got all the plastic stuff. What should I do with it?
Throw it out.
And Spring Fling.
Okay.
She was even crazier after that. I mean it, you wouldn't even have recognized her.
Buffy?
Omniplex?
Nee sitch. No way.
What happened?
Buffy was on the uneven parallels -- she was really good; coach said she could have been in the Olympics -- but she was doing a routine, spinning, and the beam broke.

Snapped. Buffy was, you know, on the upswing, and I swear to God she went across the room. Perm over heels.

Oh, my God! Ouch! No wonder you quit.
Oh, my God! Ouch! No wonder you quit.
Well, that's the thing. She landed on her feet. Didn't even sprain a toe. And I go up to her and she turns and looks at me and she's like this --
I never thought of that.
I gotta bail. You coming?
Buffy!
What is she...
Cool!
Does Jeffrey know?
The don't. You kind of wish they would, though.
Wit-tay.
Wit-tay.
I'm sorry. I'm Pike. This is Benny.
I'm sorry. I'm Pike. This is Benny.
Pike isn't a name. It's a fish.
Pike isn't a name. It's a fish.
Hey, wait a minute...
They'll kill us!
You want some punch?
Oh, God.
He is so bald.
God! Take a chill lozenge.
Like we don't have rights too?
The homelesses?
Oh, please.
Environment. That's cool with me.
Okay.
Oh, yeah!
Right!
If we don't invite all the seniors we can't use the school funds, you know that.
Can't they make exceptions? Maryanne Heinel? She's such a scud. Can't we have a Maryanne clause?
Can't they make exceptions? Maryanne Heinel? She's such a scud. Can't we have a Maryanne clause?
Well, look who's here.
Smell of booze much.
Nice much.
Buffy, the ape-woman.
Seriously, Buffy. That look was way twisted. What were you thinking about?
I really was way way too too.
Oh, please! When she ran onto the field in the middle of the game? Was that the most out-of-it thing ever, or did I blink?
Oh, please! When she ran onto the field in the middle of the game? Was that the most out-of-it thing ever, or did I blink?
I'm, like, yelling at her, 'What are you doing?' And she's going 'Jeffrey, Jeffrey!' Way mental.
What are you talking about?
Weird? You mean like you hanging out with that homeless, Poke? I saw you last night after the game.
Oh, thank you very much.
Like you've got a grip.
Like you've got a grip.
You're so out of it. You've blown off cheerleading, you've blown off dance committee --
So, we're stupid now?
You know, just because you're having full-on wiggans doesn't mean you have to drag us into it. This isn't just any dance. It happens ot be the last dance of our last year.

Except for Prom.
Except for Prom.
Right.
And the January Semi-formal --
Okay! Look, Buffy. You want to play house with the unwashed masses, that's fine. But personally, I think you ought to spend a little time prioritizing. I really do.
It's amazing what you can do with a parachute and some starch.
As long as there's room for three in it. What, didn't you bring your new friends?
What nasty bug crawled up your bungus and where the hell are you going?
I'm leaving, man. I'm bailing town. This place has gotten way too hairy.

No... You want me to give him a message?
No... You want me to give him a message?
You should think about leaving, too, man. Sell this place... Something's going on here. I don't know. Something real weird.
Ah, you'll be coming back.
I don't think so.
I don't think so.
All right. Take care of yourself.
All right. Take care of yourself.
I am.

Hey. What should I do if I see Benny?

Honey, don't ever listen to a woman when she's making love. They'll say the strangest things.

Would you rather me be making love to him, using your name, or making love to you, using his name?
Yeah maybe you're right.
You see how nice things are when we go slow?
Mmm, hmmm. You shoulda seen how many people came to the airport to see me off. When I got drafted first it was the happiest day of my Father's life. He likes baseball more than I do...
You can learn to like it.
You can learn to like it.
I wanted to be the host of Dance Fever, somethin' like that...
I wanted to be the host of Dance Fever, somethin' like that...
Y'know if you make it to the Bigs you could still become the host of Dance Fever. Baseball's a good stepping stone for things like that.

God, I never thought of that.
God, I never thought of that.
There is a lot of things you never thought of, sweetie--now get some rest for tonight's game.
I want you to wear these on the road trip when you pitch.
What?
What?
They'll fit snugly against your balls in such a wonderful way that you'll start seeing things differently--plus they'll remind you of me which is better than thinking about those nasty hitters.

You've been pitching out of the wrong side of your brain. These'll help move things to the right side.

Big League pitchers don't use these.

They did when they were in the Carolina League.
God I'm tired. What a trip I was lousy. I was worse than lousy. Everytime I pitched--it was like throwing gasoline on a fire. Kaboom. I--
What is this "I, I, I" stuff? You only talk about yourself? Aren't you glad to see me? Don't I look nice?

Just do what I say. Now, which nostril are you breathing through?
Just do what I say. Now, which nostril are you breathing through?
Which nostril am I breathing through?
The right nostril. Good.
My right nostril?
My right nostril?
There are two important psychic conduits called the "pingala" and the "ida". The pingala starts with the left testicle and ends at the right nostril.
The ida originates at the right testicle and terminates at the left nostril.
I'm really beat. I need some serious "z's"--
I'm really beat. I need some serious "z's"--
The pingala is the nostril used for throwing a baseball. And if you discover before a game you're in the wrong nostril, it's easy to switch.

Right. Okay, fire a couple in there.
You're patronizing me! I will not be patronized--
If I throw too hard I'll hurt the kid.

He's handled a lotta pitchers whose records were better than one and six.
How was that?
A little better.
A little better.
Gimme the God damn ball!
How ya like that?
Much better. Your delivery was fully integrated because you weren't thinking about it 'cause you were pissed off at me. This is progress.
I can't keep up with you. First you say sex is gonna make me a better pitcher--now no sex is gonna do it?!
It's all the same thing.
God...I think I'm gonna be sick--
Oh don't be silly. Death is nothing to be scared of. It's just another way of living. It's just a fresh start--kinda like spring training.
Death is like spring training?
Yes. And so is birth. Now look me in the eyes, Nuke-- You haven't been wearing my panties, have you?
I'm yours.
Y'know, Annie, I been thinking if it works for one game, maybe it'll work for a whole buncha games.
Y'know, Annie, I been thinking if it works for one game, maybe it'll work for a whole buncha games.
Breathing through your pingala always works, honey--

Not that. I mean the re-channeling of my sexual energy. Maybe we shouldn't make love for awhile.
Not that. I mean the re-channeling of my sexual energy. Maybe we shouldn't make love for awhile.
Now don't go overboard, I look incredibly hot, right?
You know what it feels like to throw a three hitter? We better not fuck.
Nuke?!
Nuke?!
Just till I lose.
Just till I lose.
Get over here.
Get over here.
No.

Ebby Calvin "Nuke" LaLoosh--
I'm so proud of you and all the guys. Want some more soup?
No, no, it was great.

That's my leg.
I know what it is.
I know what it is.
I figure we could work on some fundamentals even if we don't make love.
Fundamentals?
Sure. Unsnap my stockings.
Crash once called a woman's, uh-- pussy--y'know how the hair kinda makes a "V" shape?--
Yes I do...
Yes I do...
Well--he calls it the Bermuda Triangle. He said a man can get lost in there and never be heard from again.
Well--he calls it the Bermuda Triangle. He said a man can get lost in there and never be heard from again.
What a nasty thing to say.
What a nasty thing to say.
He didn't mean it nasty. He said that gettin' lost and disappearing from the face of the earth was sometimes a good thing to do-- especially like that.

Oh... Crash is a very smart man. Now c'mon, honey, give it a try.
No! You're playing with my mind!
I'm trying to play with your body!
I'm trying to play with your body!
I knew it--you're seducing me!

Cute?! I hate cute! Baby ducks are cute! I wanta be exotic and mysterious!
You're exotic and mysterious and cute--that's why I better leave.
Nuke! You got things all wrong! There's no relation between sex and baseball. Ask Crash.
I did.
I did.
What'd he say?
What'd he say?
He said if I gave in to you I'd start losing again.
He said if I gave in to you I'd start losing again.
He did?

I'll be back when we lose.
We lost.
it's okay..
I'd like you to meet my father.
Oh--won't YOU come in?
I couldn't dump my old man but maybe later I can sneak away from him...
You don't have to...
You don't have to...
I'm starting to understand what you're teaching me. I mean the panties and the nostrils and all that shit...I mean I'm getting it--
I'm starting to understand what you're teaching me. I mean the panties and the nostrils and all that shit...I mean I'm getting it--

Aw hell, let's have a quickie right here--
--but you're father's in there!
--but you're father's in there!
Crash says I gotta quit worrying about him--c'mon, honey, we got a lotta catching up to do--
It's Skip, for you.
Yeah, Skip, it's me. Jeez...Jeez...God...Jeez...
I gotta leave first thing in the morning.
That's great!
That's great!
How can I possibly thank you?
Well I guess this is it.
I won't be needing these anymore.
Neither will I.
I think I'm ready for the Show.

I got lured.

Well, he fucks like he pitches. Sorta all over the place
Omigawd, honey, I'm so happy for you.
He's a virgin.
You should be at the game.
No, no--I'm fine. Millie, how much time did you and Jimmy spend together before he proposed?
Five hours. We both just know. Do you think I deserve to wear white?

I'm Crash Davis.
Annie Savoy. Wanta dance?

I don't dance.

She's dancing with me.
Crash, I didn't think you--
Crash, I didn't think you--
I'll learn. C'mon--
These are the ground rules. I hook up with one guy a season-- I mean it takes me a couple of weeks to pick the guy--kinda my own spring training... And, well, you two are the most promising prospects of the season so far. So... I thought we should get to know each other.
Why do you get to choose? Why don't I get to choose?
Why do you get to choose? Why don't I get to choose?
Actually none of us on this planet ever really choose each other. It's all Quantum Physics and molecular attraction. There are laws we don't understand that bring us together and break us apart.
After 12 years in the minor leagues, I don't tryout. Besides-- I don't believe in, Quantum Physics when it comes to matters of the heart...or loins.
What do you believe in?
I believe in the soul, the cock, the pussy, the small of a woman's back, the hanging curve ball, high fiber, good scotch, long foreplay, show tunes, and that the novels of Thomas Pynchon are self-indulgent, overrated crap. I believe that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone, I believe that there oughtta be a constitutional amendment outlawing astro-turf and the designated hitter, I believe in
Oh my... Don't leave...
Oh my... Don't leave...
G'night.
Wait, Crash--don't go--all I want is a date. I'm not gonna fall in love with you or nothin'.
I'm not interested in a woman who's interested in that boy.
I'm not interested in a woman who's interested in that boy.

See my hips?
Yep.
Yep.
I think Thomas Pynchon's a genius.

When you're hitting you shouldn't think about anything but hitting. But you shouldn't think about it too much. The trick is to use your brain to not use your brain.

Young men are uncomplicated. And he's not "dim". He's just inexperienced. My job is to give him "life-wisdom" and help him make it to the major leagues.

Damn.
You're pulling your hips out.
You're pulling your hips out.
But they're nice hips. I looked up your records-- You've hit 227 home runs in the minors. That's great!
Don't tell anybody.
Why not? If you hit twenty homers this year you'll be the all time minor league champ! The record's

Your place or mine?
Despite my love of weird metaphysics and my rejection of most Judao-Christian ethics, I am, within the framework of a baseball season, monogamous.

Fact is you're afraid of meeting a guy like me 'cause It might be real so you sabotage it with some bullshit about commitment to a young boy you can boss around-- Great deal. You get to write self- indulgent little poems all winter about how hard it is to find a man even though you just sent him packing- So what do you
Well, Annie, your place or mine?
You got me all confused.

And he's right! A ballplayer on a streak has to respect the streak. They don't happen very often. You know how hard this game is? If you believe you're playing well because you're getting laid or because you're not getting laid or because you wore red silk panties--then you are! And I still think Thomas Pynchon is full of shit.

Who are you? Do you have a job?
I teach part time at the Junior College. What if I told you I was through with Nuke? He learned his lessons quickly and left me.

God damn you--what is happening? Is there no man who'll have me? This is the weirdest season I ever saw--the Durham Bulls can't lose and I can't get laid!
You okay?
Why baseball?
I was raised in a Baptist church got dipped in the water when I was 5-- born again before kindergarten...by the time I was 10 I knew it was bullshit and at 15 I ran away from home...
I crossed the street--it was the New York Yankees spring training field--tok, tok, tok, was the sound of a ball hitting a bat-- and I sat in the warm bleachers to think about my mother... And I saw him.
Who?
Who?
Thurman Munson. He was covered with dirt and he was fighting with everybody--it was beautiful ... And he called the ump a cocksucker and got thrown out of the game even though it was an exhibition! So I stayed in the bleachers all spring and gradually came to understand what's so great about baseball.

What's so great about baseball?
If you know where home plate is, then you know where 1st base is, and 2nd, and everything else-- 'cause they're always in the same place in relation to home. Don't you see? If you know where home plate is, then you know where everything else in the universe is!
I don't know if I'd go that far.
It's true, It's true! Least it used to be true. It ain't possible that baseball's not enough anymore, is it, Crash?
It's true, It's true! Least it used to be true. It ain't possible that baseball's not enough anymore, is it, Crash?

Why not?
Why not?
Whatta you mean "why not"? Are you gonna play forever?!
I got released.
I heard already.
... so you see in a former lifetime I'm sure that I was Alexandria, the Czarette of Russia? What do you think?
How come in former lifetimes, everybody was someone famous? How come nobody ever says they were Joe Schmo?
How come in former lifetimes, everybody was someone famous? How come nobody ever says they were Joe Schmo?
It doesn't work like that. God, you're gorgeous. Want to dance?

Take this to Ebby in the dugout between innings.
What's it say?

It says he's not bending his back on his follow-through.
Oh dear....easy honey...
Ninety-five miles an hour...
Hum, babe, hum, babe, fire it in here, hum babe--
That's not necessary, Jackson--- Okay, Nuke, now lean in for the sign.
Ninety-three miles an hour.
He looks wonderful, Jackson...
Oh no--he's shaking off the sign, Jackson. Big mistake...
He'll learn.
Ebby's told me a lot about you.
Uh oh... Can I offer you some coffee?
He's a good student.
We were worried that Ebby might get involved with the wrong crowd in professional baseball--we're so pleased, he met a Christian woman.

Praise the Lord, eh?
Let's have a quick word of prayer, right here, to thank the Lord for all this--
Oh let's not...
God bless you.
She will, Mr. LaLoosh, she will ...
Thanks for the note--you're right, I wasn't bending my back.

You need a nickname.

That's what I been telling everybody! Wanta dance?
Well--you boys stopped fighting yet? Are you pals now? Good. I love a little macho male bonding-- I think it's sweet even if it's probably latent homosexuality being "re-channeled" but I believe in "re-channeling" so who cares, right? Shall we go to my place?
Which one of us?
Which one of us?

Don't think.
Fun? What's he know about fun? Why's he calling for a curveball? I wanta bring heat.
Shake off the pitch. Throw what you wanta.
Why you shaking me off?
I wanta throw the heater to announce my presence with authority.

He did know.
He did know.
How?
How?
I told him.
Oh she may get wooly, women do get wooly, because of all the stress...
Gimme that.
How come you don't like me?
'Cause you don't respect yourself, which is your problem, but you don't respect the game--and that's my problem. You got a gift.
'Cause you don't respect yourself, which is your problem, but you don't respect the game--and that's my problem. You got a gift.
What do I got?

A gift. When you were a baby the gods reached down and turned your left arm into a thunderbolt.
You got a Hall of Fame arm but you're pissing it away.
I ain't pissing nothing away--I got a Porsche already. A 944 with A.C. and a quadraphonic Blaupunkt.
I ain't pissing nothing away--I got a Porsche already. A 944 with A.C. and a quadraphonic Blaupunkt.

If I get laid, you won't tell Annie?
If I get laid, you won't tell Annie?

Party without me.
God--what a Big League move.
Can I ask you something?
What?
What?
What would you think of a pitcher who wore women's panties?
What would you think of a pitcher who wore women's panties?
If he had a good breaking ball, I'd respect the shit outta him.
I was playing naked.
I know, I know--I have that dream all the time. We're almost home.
Annie says her panties will keep one side of my brain occupied while I'm on the mound, thus keeping my brain slightly off center, which is where it should be for artists and pitchers. She also said I should throw whatever pitches you call for.
Annie's a smart lady.
I was great, eh?
Your fastball was up and your curveball was hanging--in the Show they woulda ripped you.

Boring.

"...Good Lord willing, things'll work out."
Yep. So how's Annie?
She's getting steamed 'cause I'm still re-channeling my sexual energy--maybe I should cave in and sleep with her once just to calm her down. What'ya think?
You outta your mind? If you give in now you might start losing. Never fuck with a winning streak.
What's wrong?
I'm nervous--my old man's here.
Anybody says anything bad about Millie, I'll break his neck.
Hey, guys, I got a game to pitch.
Club's expanding its roster to finish the season--
Shut up. I'm playing. Oh you won't regret it, young girls don't forget it, lost in their own wilderness ... But it's all so easy--Just try a little tenderness...

C'mon, we got nothin' to fight about.
You fuck!
You fuck!
Why am I a fuck?
Why am I a fuck?
Why are you a fuck? 'Cause you got talent. I got brains. But you got talent! You're God damn left arm is worth a million dollars a year. All my limbs put together are worth 7 cents a pound--and that's for science and dog meat.

Okay, I'll kick your ass there.
I'll take you back to the hotel.
You know what the difference Is between hitting .250 and hitting .300? 1 got it figured out. Twenty-five hits a year in 500 at bats is 50 points. Okay? There's 6 months in a season, that's about 25 weeks--you get one extra flare a week--just one--a gork, a ground ball with eyes, a dying quail-- just one more dying quail a week and you're
Nuke...tell me something. Did you hit me with your right or your left?
My right.
Good. Good. That's terrific...

No.
No.
You will. Look, Nuke--these Big League hitters are gonna light you up like a pin ball machine for awhile-- don't worry about it. Be cocky and arrogant even when you're getting beat. That's the secret. You gotta play this game with fear and arrogance.

Why are you doing this to me?
I'm a little in shock, quite frankly...
Now, instead of the cops only lookin' at Nicky, they started looking at Green too. And he was supposed to be our squeaky...

It's a pity in this...
First of all, what they did was totally unconstitutional. We're already on the list to be heard before the Supreme Court of the United States later this year.

All right, look, if he took a break, it would just give everybody some time to maneuver. That's all I'm saying. It's all that I'm saying.

I would forget about the maneuver. I would just get out.
I would forget about the maneuver. I would just get out.
I can't do that.
Even after a little vacation, they hassled him at the airport.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
I mean, Frank Marino was there to meet him, but so were the cops. This time they wanted to pinch him for some diamond burglary in Antwerp.
...stupid things.
Watch it, partner, watch it!
Watch it, partner, watch it!
The worst was Blue.
...been right, but who knows?
Jesus Christ! What gun? He's got a fuckin' hero sandwich here.
No, you're not calm.
...I will let her in the house for five minutes if you gentlemen will escort her out if she happens not to want to leave. Because I don't - I -
Yeah, I don't want her in there more than a few more minutes.
No, it's - it'll just be a couple of minutes. We got other things to do too, you know. He'll hurry her up. How's everything else besides this?
No, it's - it'll just be a couple of minutes. We got other things to do too, you know. He'll hurry her up. How's everything else besides this?
Fine, fine. How's your family?
Fine, fine. How's your family?
Not bad, not bad. In fact, uh, my wife's pregnant again.
Not bad, not bad. In fact, uh, my wife's pregnant again.
Oh, good.
Oh, good.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Congratulations.
Okay, Randy. Thank you.
All right, take care.
Stop -
Wait, hold on a second.
Wait, hold on a second.
Hey!
Hey!
Hold on a second.
Look, look. You can't stop her for speeding? I mean, look what the hell she's doing.
Speeding?
But one thing I could never understand, was that she could have everything under control, except for her old pimp boyfriend, Lester Diamond.
Look, Gin, you know I got other people in this. I got partners. But I want you to understand that I am lookin' out for you in this thing. Okay? You're going to get yours back... and you're gonna get it back first. Okay?
Yeah.
He was a moocher, a card cheat, a country-club golf hustler. A scumbag... chasing dentists for a few bucks.
She's my wife. Look at me. You did know that, didn't you? You knew that she's my wife? Huh? Hey, look at me.
Yeah, yeah. I know that.
Yeah, yeah. I know that.
You do? Yeah? Well, if you ever come back again... ever... to take her money... next time bring a pistol. That way you got a chance. Be a man, don't be a fuckin' pimp. Now, you want to do me a favor? Get out of here. I want to be alone with my wife. Get the fuck up and get out of here.
Okay.
You fuckin' piece of shit.
You fuckin' piece of shit.
Hey, that's just fuckin' - That's bullshit. You know, you know, what the fuck?
M- Uh, Mr. and Mrs. Rothstein?
Hey, little Dale Evans.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Yeah, is this Lester? This is Sam...
Yeah, is this Lester? This is Sam...

You got it. Schmuck. All right. I just bought us a few minutes. Want to get back at this prick?
Now this is just a signature card.
So, once she signs those papers, she'll be the only person to have total access to the box? No one else, including myself?
So, once she signs those papers, she'll be the only person to have total access to the box? No one else, including myself?
That's right.
Sam, let me ask you a question. You must really trust your wife.
Yeah, sure I do. Why?
Yeah, sure I do. Why?
No, tha-that's good. It's just unusual. To tell you the truth, so many of my clients don't.
No, tha-that's good. It's just unusual. To tell you the truth, so many of my clients don't.
Well...
Oh. Have a good day at school.
Okay.
Hello? Hello! Ginger.
Help, Daddy!
Amy! Amy, open the door!
I can't! I'm tied!
I can't! I'm tied!
Wh-wh -
Dad!
What happened? What happened? Who did this to you?
What happened? What happened? Who did this to you?
Mommy.
Mommy.
I'm gonna get a knife and cut you loose, honey, I'll -
I'm gonna get a knife and cut you loose, honey, I'll -
Oh, no, please, please.
When did this happen, honey?
I don't know.
You don't know? What time did your mother do this? When did she leave?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Ohhh...
...by the only kind of guys that can actually get you that kind of money: sixty-two million, seven-hundred thousand dollars. I don't know all the details.
Matter of fact...
But it's in the desert where lots of the town's problems are solved.
Got a lot of holes in the desert, and a lot of problems are buried in those holes. Except you gotta do it right. I mean, you gotta have the hole already dug before you show up with a package in the trunk. Otherwise you're talkin' about a half-hour or forty-five minutes of diggin'. And who knows who's gonna be comin' along in that
...give him a shot at runnin' a casino and he tries to talk you out of it.
You know, I don't know if I could do this even if I wanted to. The Gaming Commission would never give me a license. I have at least two dozen gambling and bookmaking pinches on me.
You know, havin' some fun with it, shit like that.
Where the hell did you learn how to deal?

He bet like a fuckin' brain surgeon.
He bet like a fuckin' brain surgeon.
Place the checks properly. That's the way you do it.
I'll take Columbia for twenty.
If his girlfriend was knocked up.
Yeah, we made a great pair. I made book and Nicky made sure we always collected. The old men loved us. And why not? They all made money with us.
They payin'?
They payin'?
How did Nicky collect?
It was eight. Ace... tell him the line on the Bear's game.
Eight.
Eight.
If he don't know, nobody knows. Told you it was eight.
What's that? You hear? You hear a little girl, Frankie? You hear a little girl, Ace? Is that a little fuckin' girl?! What happened to the fuckin' tough guy? Told my friend stick it up his fuckin' ass?! Huh?! Huh?!
Wait a sec, Nicky, Nicky, Nicky. Ta- take it easy.
While I was tryin' to figure out why the guy was sayin' what he was sayin', Nicky just hit him. No matter how big a guy might be, Nicky would take him on. You beat Nicky with fists, he comes back with a bat. You beat him with a knife, he comes back with a gun. And you beat him with a gun, you
Listen...
But nobody had to take care of Nicky.
You find any cash in there, we'll whack it up with you.
You find any cash in there, we'll whack it up with you.
I mean, he took care of himself only too well. And that's why every badge back home wanted to nail him.
...nobody interfered with the fuckin' skim.
Hey.
Okay, Sammy.
Somethin', huh?
Somethin', huh?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Ginger.
Holy shit, what've you been doin' out here?
Honey, come here.
After we ate, we left Jennifer and Ginger alone and we took a ride to talk. And then... he hit me with it.
What do you think about me movin' out here? What's the matter? You got a problem with that?
What do you think about me movin' out here? What's the matter? You got a problem with that?
No, of course not.
No, of course not.
You mean, I have your permission?
You mean, I have your permission?
Sure, you have my permission. But I - I just gotta tell you it's no joke out here. It's no joke, you know? You gotta keep a low profile. It's not like back home. Right off the bat, they don't like guys like us. And this sheriff's a real cowboy. Even the coppers aren't afraid to bury people out in the desert here.

I don't care. I want to get away from back home for a while. I'm tired of that shit back there. Look at this place. It's made of money. You know what the best part is? Nobody's gonna know what we're doin'! There's nobody here to see us! Everybody's back home.

Nick, I gotta tell you, I got pinched twice for no reason. You really gotta be careful. I'm running a licensed place. Everything's legit.
Nick, I gotta tell you, I got pinched twice for no reason. You really gotta be careful. I'm running a licensed place. Everything's legit.
Don't worry about it. I'm not gonna do anything. What am I gonna do? I'm especially not gonna involve you in anything.
But I saw it another. I saw it as untouched. I mean, they had bookies, pimps and drug dealers I could shake down. Who the fuck were they gonna run to? So, I started getting everybody in line. Best of all, for the first time in my life, I figured out a way not to lose.
Yeah, he had a fool-proof scheme, all right. It wasn't very scientific but it worked. When he won, he collected. When he lost, he told the bookies to go fuck themselves. What were they gonna do? Muscle Nicky? Nicky was the muscle.
Ohh!
And, Nicky being Nicky, he made his presence known.
Especially at the casino, where he definitely did not work, people got the message.
Me? That's why the bosses sent me out here. They wanted me to make sure none of the other crews robbed the joint. Like these two fuckin' balloon-heads over here [EDDY and JERRY]. They were gonna try and bang us out of two hundred fuckin' grand? Yeah, right, I'm sure.
When I married Ginger I knew all the stories, but I didn't give a fuck. 'I'm Sam Rothstein,' I said. 'I can change her.'
It was typical Ace. He invited the biggest people in town and he knew they'd show. Because he knew they all wanted somethin' from him. With Ace, nobody ever got a free ride. Even Ginger. With her -
...Nicky was dreamin' his own kind of Vegas.
To begin, I put money out on the streets, chargin' three points a week. You know - juice to the fuckin' dealers.
...the next thing I did, I started bustin' out high-stakes poker players.
It was so obvious. I mean, all of Nicky's half-assed mechanics, they were real signal happy.
And I didn't want any of those agents near my place.
Four aces, Doc.
I mean, Nicky's a made guy and I'm not. I can't do that.
Be careful. Gaming agents are all over the place.
Be careful. Gaming agents are all over the place.
So, I'm lucky. I'm not allowed to get lucky in this place?
So, I'm lucky. I'm not allowed to get lucky in this place?
You been lucky all week. They're lookin' to nail ya.
No, I didn't know that. But you know what he did?
No.
He insulted Billy. And then I walked over to him politely...
...and he tells me to go fuck myself.
...and he tells me to go fuck myself.
What?
What?
Then he called me a faggot.
Then he called me a faggot.
So what do you think I do? I threw that cocksucker out.
So what do you think I do? I threw that cocksucker out.
What? Ho- Hey, come here.
If he does it again, he's out for good. I don't care what it is, Nick, I'm gonna ha- I'll - I'll never let him in the place again.
I'm sorry about this. Really.
I'm sorry about this. Really.
All right, Ace?
All right, Ace?
Okay.
Okay.
Thanks, pal.
But I'll tell you, he knew how to bring in the crowds. He knew all the fuckin' angles. He brought over the whole 'Femme Fatale' show from Paris. But he forgot how lazy them European dancin' broads can get. I mean, he had to weigh 'em in once a week to make sure they didn't blow up like fuckin' balloons.
You're still eight pounds over. What's the reason for this?
Hey, I gotta give the guy credit. He does the most obvious thing. This is the only town in the country where a bookie joint is legit, so, why not take advantage, right? So... he took bookie joints off the street and then opened them up inside the casino. Well, within a few years, by doin' all of this, he had every casino on
Between...
You better watch yourself. There's a lot of heat on you already.
Why, somebody's complaining?
Why, somebody's complaining?
I'm - I'm hearin' things from security. They're all ex-cops. The Sheriff's lookin' to bust your balls. They want to put you in the Black Book.
I'm - I'm hearin' things from security. They're all ex-cops. The Sheriff's lookin' to bust your balls. They want to put you in the Black Book.
That Black Book is a bunch of bullshit. They got two names in there for the whole country and one of them is still Al Capone.
That Black Book is a bunch of bullshit. They got two names in there for the whole country and one of them is still Al Capone.
Bullshit or no bullshit, they put you in that book, you're gonna be in a lot of trouble. You will not be able to walk into the casino. I'm tellin' you.
Bullshit or no bullshit, they put you in that book, you're gonna be in a lot of trouble. You will not be able to walk into the casino. I'm tellin' you.
What am I doin' out here? I'm tryin' to make a livin', that's all.

I'm just tellin' you. Don't say I didn't warn you.
I'm just tellin' you. Don't say I didn't warn you.
All right.
Well, it wasn't long before what I was afraid was gonna happen, happened. Nicky managed to get himself banned from every casino in Las Vegas, and from then on, I couldn't be seen talkin' to him anywhere in Vegas, or even near it.
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?
' ...detrimental to gaming. And he will be ejected from any casino in Las Vegas... and the casinos can be fined as much as a hundred thousand every time he shows up.' Do you believe this shit?
Yeah, I believe it. You got banned.
Motherfucker. Unsavory fuckin'... Is there any way around this?
Nope, there's no way.
Nope, there's no way.
Let's say... for instance... I want to go in the restaurant which happens to be in the casino... to get one of those sandwiches I like?
Let's say... for instance... I want to go in the restaurant which happens to be in the casino... to get one of those sandwiches I like?
Forget it. You can't even set foot in the parking lot. That's how serious it is.
Forget it. You can't even set foot in the parking lot. That's how serious it is.
In other words, I'm fucked.
In other words, I'm fucked.
In so many words, yes.
In so many words, yes.
It just didn't sink into his head about the Black Book and what it meant. Not being able to go into a casino is just one thing, but being in this book etched your name into the brains of every cop and FBI agent in the state. I mean, you're listed in there with Al Capone. But Nicky didn't care.

I gotta do somethin'. I gotta do somethin'. They ain't gettin' rid of me. They're not gettin' rid of me. I'm staying here. Fuck 'em. Fuck 'em.
Yeah, Nicky loved restaurants. He was a real restaurant buff. And over the years, he always made money with them.
Hey, Rich.
- no matter where he was or what he was doing, he always went home to make breakfast for his son, Nicky- Boy.
Here, let's put a little of this on for you. I know you like this. A little butter, right, not a lot?
Hello.
Listen...
No, no it's okay.
It's impossible. It's booked up, and you gotta make a reservation. It's...
It's impossible. It's booked up, and you gotta make a reservation. It's...
...very difficult to get in.
...very difficult to get in.
Well, it's okay. I'll use the service entrance. I'll see you at nine.
Hey, Ace.
Hey.
You think he got the point?
What're you doin'? He's a square guy, for chrissakes. You can't treat him like that. He's gonna run to the FBI.
What're you doin'? He's a square guy, for chrissakes. You can't treat him like that. He's gonna run to the FBI.
Fuck the FBI! That prick's been dodging me for three weeks. And what is it with you? All of a sudden, you're tryin' to tell me what to do all the time.
Fuck the FBI! That prick's been dodging me for three weeks. And what is it with you? All of a sudden, you're tryin' to tell me what to do all the time.
I'm not tryin' to tell you what to do. But you were way out of line, Nick. What're you doin'? Where's your head?
I'm not tryin' to tell you what to do. But you were way out of line, Nick. What're you doin'? Where's your head?
Where's my head? Where's your fuckin' balls? Huh? You know I'm tryin' to put somethin' really big together out here. You know what I'm talkin' about, huh? You know! If you're actin' like this now, how can I depend on you? There's a lot of things gonna change out here. And if you wanna be there with me, Sammy, you're gonna have to go

Listen, Nick, you gotta understand my situation. I'm responsible for thousands of people. I got a hundred million a year goin' through the place. It's all over, I'm gonna tell you, it's all over, if I don't get that license. And believe me, if it goes bad for me, it's gonna go bad for a lot of people, you understand?

Yeah, forget about your fuckin' license. I plant my own flag out here, you ain't gonna need a fuckin' license. You know, I don't know what it is, Sammy, but the more I talk to you, the more I feel like you just don't wanna go along with me, is that it?
Yeah, forget about your fuckin' license. I plant my own flag out here, you ain't gonna need a fuckin' license. You know, I don't know what it is, Sammy, but the more I talk to you, the more I feel like you just don't wanna go along with me, is that it?

You mean, quiet like this: 'I'm the boss.' That's quiet?

That's all taken out of context. Okay.

Yeah, that's right, the way you need me to vouch for you as a citizen and get you out of one of your jams. I'm gonna have to straighten out what you just did with this guy.
This guy is gonna run to the FBI.
Your fuckin' head is getting' bigger than your casino. That's your problem, pal.

Fuckin' walking around with a big head. You better check yourself...
Nicky wanted to take over. He wanted to go after Gaggi, go after the skim, go after everything and everybody.
Nicky was questioned in two dozen murders, but they always had to let him go. There were never any witnesses.
The coppers blamed me for everything that went wrong out here, and I mean every little fuckin' thing too.
Peekaboo, you fucks, you.
I see you, you motherfuckers.
I see you, you motherfuckers.
The problem was, Nicky was not only bringin' heat on himself, but on me too. The FBI watched every move he made. But he didn't care. He just didn't care.
...on the line and this guy's out havin' the time of his life. He has every cop in the state watchin' him, and he's out playin' golf.
Practice enough this week, you prick?
Practice enough this week, you prick?
And at the...

No? You said I'm bringin' heat on you?! I gotta listen to people because of your fuckin' shit?! You're ordering me out?! You better get your own fuckin' army, pal!
I didn't do anything. I mean, I didn't order you or anybody... I only told Andy Stone that you had a lot of heat on you, and that was a problem.

She was afraid to call you.

Well, once you get her here, you think about it, you know? But get the kid back here. She wants to come back. That's the, uh, that's the main thing here. You want your kid, don't you? Huh?
Hello.

It's me.

Hey, it is my pleasure.
Yeah, I heard a lot about you.
Yeah, I heard a lot about you.
Oh, thank you, sir.
Hey, house is doin' well. Hey, all that money is rollin' in. I appreciate you takin' the time to see a poor ol' civil servant.
No, that's quite all right.
Uh, I come here personally to kind of smooth over a fracas about a certain matter. See, uh, maybe you didn't know it, but, uh, Don Ward is a very well-liked man in this town. He's got lots of friends here. Now, his family and their money go back many, many years. Now, friends vote... family and money votes. That's important to me... and
I'm sorry, but he knew about our gettin' hit on three big machines in a row and he did nothing about it. That means either he was in on it or, forgive me for saying this, he was too dumb to see what was going on. Either way, I cannot have a man like that workin' here.

Before we point the dirty end of the stick at 'ol Don, uh, we better be sure we can prove them charges.

I think you're way out of line talkin' to me like that. What you're sayin' is libelous, and you're in no position to challenge my expertise. I went way out of my way to be very helpful and courteous to that kid. He's weak, he's incompetent. He jeopardizes the whole place. There's not much more I can do for him.

You have got me there. Old Don is as useless as tits on a boar. But, he is my brother-in-law, and I would look on it as a personal favor if you'd think some more on hirin' him back.

Well, could there be any position... further down the trough?
I'm sorry, I can't do anything. He's too incompetent. And the bottom line is, he cannot be trusted.
Okay, thanks. Um... you know, that's it. I'm sorry.
Mr Rothstein. Your people never will understand the way it works out here. You're all just our guests. But you act like you're at home. Let me tell you somethin', partner... you ain't home. But that's where we're gonna send you if it harelips the Governor. Thank you for your time.

They were ready to blame him for anything, no matter where it happened.
You go and put your things away.
And they were usually right.
Because Nicky enjoyed being a gangster, and he didn't give a damn who knew it.
Come on. There we go. Look at that. Beautiful.
I mean, that's what worried me, 'cause it turns out Nicky was about to be sent to Vegas.
All right, we're clear.

Within no time, everything was set in place. We got rid of the freelance scamsters. The per was way up. The gods were happy, or as happy as the gods can ever be. And I, I decided to complicate my life. For a guy who likes sure things, I was about to bet the rest of my life on a real longshot.

Crooked cops and kidnappers, they don't take checks.

You remember when you called him that night? When you said goodbye to him? He didn't say, 'Don't get married, I'll be right down, we'll get married.' He didn't say that to you, did he?
No, he didn't.
No, he didn't.
Didn't. No, instead, what did he say? 'Fuck him. Take him for everything he's got.'

The good part was, I had Amy back. So, we went home, had the housekeeper stay over, put the kid to bed, I calmed myself down and we went to dinner. I tried to keep things nice and civil, you know. But... hey, twenty-five thousand for three suits? That doesn't make much sense.
First of all, he's not gonna wear f- thousand-dollar suits. But let's say he did, which he won't. How you gonna get fitted for twenty-five suits in three days? I, um, I mean, how could you get fitted that fast? I can't get fitted that fast, and I pay twice as much.

Plus, at the most, three suits, a thousand apiece. That still leaves what? Around ten thousand?

Definitely the most important guy in this room.
But back then the bosses didn't give a fuck about whether he enjoyed himself of not. To them, he was a cash register. All they had to do was ring the bell and take the money. Especially Remo, who was a fuckin' degenerate gambler who always lost.
Ma che cazzo!
I mean, unless Ace made his bet.
That's enough now!
Ace.
Keepin' Remo happy with money was the greatest insurance policy in the world.

I was wondering, if you're not doing anything tonight...Would you like to go to dinner? I know; a tame suggestion considering the wide variety of miniature golf possibilities available to the Oasisburg citizen--but nevertheless, would you?

You're very special. Selina, I'm not a very good liar. I feel very strongly about you...forgive me use of architecture metaphors, but I instantly know a good foundation when I see one..
I despise these kind of winds. Sorry, I guess I'm a little on edge. Seems this Catwoman has everyone, men and women, on edge. Don't you feel Catwoman says something about the duality of all men and women...
Stop. We are not having a "duality" conversation. "Ooh, he has a secret side. Ooh, she has a dark side." Please. Duality is a joke. You get one, do you understand me? You get one life. One shot. I'm so tired of women saying "I have an inner strength" or "Deep down, I'm really ambitious." "One day I'll design my own line of clothing

So, did you see "Seinfeld" last week? That Kramer-guy really makes me laugh.
I'm sorry I went off like that, I get passionate. I--I guess I'm a passionate person. One of those things I had forgotten. When you were a little boy did you want to grow up to be a superhero?
What little boy doesn't... My God...it's, it's...Catwoman.
What little boy doesn't... My God...it's, it's...Catwoman.
No it's not.
A whip? Now that's going too far! Some of these women have no shame!
What's the matter? What are you saying?
What's the matter? What are you saying?
Well, it's just that I would think that the woman who is the real, non- imitation Catwoman would be pretty angry at some little amateur minx stealing the whole whip idea. Really angry.
This is insane. Let the heroes handle it. I'd better get you home...I should check on my warehouse to make sure it hasn't been hit...
Your warehouse? Go on ahead--to your "warehouse." I'll be okay...
Your warehouse? Go on ahead--to your "warehouse." I'll be okay...
Are you sure?
Are you sure?
I'm sure.
Selina, did you make it home, all right? I tried calling, but your mother said that there was "no extension in the Hut." Whatever that means..
I got home fine. How's the "warehouse."

Fine. You're angry. Don't be. The important thing is we're together now..

Exactly. I don't know what I'd do without you.
Exactly. I don't know what I'd do without you.
Uh Brock, today you are without me...
Tonight, somewhere in the city, innocent people will die--but then one of you knows that; for one of you is a vicious pirate-terrorist posing as the beloved superhero Captain God.
What did you say? Selina, sit down, the entire city is going crazy...You have to just calm down...
Hmm. Not bad.
You're telling the truth. I can tell..How did this..
No-o. You know, questions like that don't help your cause--
I still can't get over it. I still can't believe you're Catwoman..
Quite a pair we make. Thank you, Jeff.
A couple that battles the forces of evil together is a couple that stays together. Thank you, Jeff.
Oh now, you put up a good fight. Let's change the subject. Where do people who live in Oasisburg go to get away from it all?
Somewhere very far away, very quiet, and very... This is all wonderful, Selina, but...But I'm afraid I can not rest until all my sister's killers are brought to justice...That one-armed monster..
This ring belonged to my sister. I'd love for you to...
It would be honor, Brock. Now let's go get this guy...
It would be honor, Brock. Now let's go get this guy...
You're serious? You'd help me...
In many ways, that obnoxious creep Cactus was the worst one of all. He got off on giving out pain...
We'll hunt him down together...
I thought you said you weren't a very good liar.
I lied.
There you are darling...Have we met, Lewis Lane, Oasisburg Times.
Oh, how long have you had your own route?
Oh, how long have you had your own route?
Can I just say what a classy touch the neon urinals are, Mr. Architect? I just love risking electrocution every time I..
Women, huh?
They do take their time. So..Selina Kyle...

Selina Kyle...lovely person.

She has a real spirit.

A bit on the suspicious side, don't you think?

She has reason to be suspicious..Doesn't she?
She has reason to be suspicious..Doesn't she?
I suppose she does.
I better go report this in...
Oh, you don't have to explain to me where you're going...
Selina, are you okay?
Yes, did you call us here for any particular reason?
You're kidding.
But it's true! You can call him yourself.
You're right, I wasn't looking to fall in love with a casino worker. I'd given up trying to find anyone. But there was a fire in your eyes that cut right through the air conditioning and through the coldness of my heart.
Your uniform, that first time I saw you, was a ghastly cage I vowed to unlock in order to..
We're waiting.
Quiet, Blender Boy. I told you from the beginning, Selina, I'm not a very good liar. I am not Captain God, or whatever else he may be calling himself this month, but when I find out who is--The Man will pay. My sister died in that Museum attack. You can check the Atlanta obituaries. I've tracked these monsters from city to city, waiting for

Did you ever think that maybe neither of us is Captain God?
I can. That's not an admission of guilt, It's just..I knew you had it in you...
It may be time to get the police involved...
I've been looking for you.
I've been looking for you. Selina Kyle was right. One of us is a psychotic crusader.

You've lost all motor functions. The poison will kill you in ten minutes.

Priceless...We have a showdown in this alley, right?
Don't you feel so much better now that you know everything? Blink once for yes, twice for..
Boss, we better roll if we're going to hit this place, blow it up, and make that flight..
Boss, we better roll if we're going to hit this place, blow it up, and make that flight..
Just hold on! I'm not done. There are two kinds of men in the world, Selina. In Category A, you have Me. In Category B is everyone who wants to be in Category A, but are too afraid, too weak..!
God, can you hear me!
Wha-at?
Wha-at?
Catwomen. Lots of them!
Catwomen. Lots of them!
Oh come on, Cactus, be a man! The blimp is still on schedule, right?
I thought cats were supposed to have nine lives, not thirty one! What do you think you're doing?
Winning.
Winning.
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?
At this point, a nap. Oh by the way, I killed your butler and your dog..

Oh Honey, it's so much better when we do it without the helmet.
I've been thinking. I've been thinking about us. I'm sorry I've been so hard no you these past couple days. I realize now it's because you're the only woman who ever understood me and I couldn't handle it! I've never revealed myself to anyone the way I have to you. Let's blow this town together. We'll run a bed-and-breakfast in Vermont by day, and

I know, I know, a Warrior. You're very annoying..Now tell me how to defuse the bomb you've set..
Will you please stop fighting? Just let those people die so we can get on with our new lives together! Trust me, one day we'll look back on this day and laugh. You got to admit, it's a lot more fun to be the villain.
You might be right, but Fun is overrated. I need something real.
You might be right, but Fun is overrated. I need something real.
Well then, let's agree to disagree...Now how about a picture for my scrapbook?
Don't you realize there's nothing you can do, anyway! Nine minutes and it's all over! The Fun Palace is a tomb. No one can get out. And choke on this furball: all doors and windows are blocked, locked, and electrified! Even the glass around the bomb is rigged.
Even the skylight?
Even the skylight?
The "skylight?" Fool! It's too high for anybody to climb out the damn skylight...

What about "climbing in?"
The shopkeeper on 13th street won't drop the lawsuit--He still claims one of the lasers we fired at the Jenkins gang burned down his store..
I hate innocent bystanders. Whine, whine, whine. Will he settle?
"Dat's gotta hurt!"
He didn't remember to roll up his window...
What's the catch?
Ooh, I've read about this philly. She's the one who gave that wimp Batman all those migraines up in Gotham...
Not now, Mammoth. Adonis is right. We've had a good run here--the protection kickbacks from the crime syndicates, the merchandising scams-- Tomorrow night we have a big, violent, complicated and lucrative mission to pull off. We chould be resting up.
Resting Up? Sorry Spooky, I've got to go with God on this one. I hate to think we're just in this for the money. Garfield's girlfriend crossed a line last night and she's got to get spayed. We're going out of Oasisburg on a win.
Yeah, this is better than rape.
Cactus, sometimes you don't deserve to wear our logo.
Cactus, sometimes you don't deserve to wear our logo.
Touchy. Look everybody, it's Casper, the friendly crimefighter...
What a "drag."
"Well done," Cactus.
Cactus--shooting a man in the back is not very noble.
That is not a man, Captain God. That is Vomit accidentally born with two legs.
That is not a man, Captain God. That is Vomit accidentally born with two legs.
Well. I stand corrected.
Boss-man, what were you going on about last night: "I am the Law and I am the Danish..."
I don't know what I was saying. I totally phoned it in last night. I haven't been getting a lot of sleep lately...
Right time. That was kind of fun. She had spunk.
Why am I still troubled...
I don't know, Boss, you saw what the big guy did to the last kitty we gave him.
How could I forget. Mammoth--go pet the kitty.
God-damn..
What did you say?
What did you say?
Sorry man, I didn't mean that personally...
Sorry man, I didn't mean that personally...
I know how you feel, humiliated in the hands of a woman. I'd rather eat my soul on a paper plate...
Ah, did you hear that? Spooky loved you...
Yeah...pretty gross. Hurry, we've got work to do.
Quite a little performance you gave in the casino today--for me and that other guy. Come on down, let's chat..
I got her...
Car wash, Captain?
Absolutely.
My, the Perpetrator seems to be a bit on the "Wild" side..
I'll put that in the report--after you shoot her.
Oh, I wish they wouldn't feed him like that.
Now he'll be up all night...
Well, we spent enough time building the damn thing, might as well use it.
A bit sadistic, don't you think, Captain...?
Well, you don't see that everyday. Somebody tell me what's the deal with Frida Kahlo here?
Just a homeless woman. Wrong place.
You like them, don't you, Boss.
Oh, I like her. I like her a lot. I want to save this one for later. Something that tasty you don't eat all at once. Go back to your alter- egos, we'll regroup in the morning.
The Tranquilizer Tranquility will hold for about an hour..where is she? These women are out here on a lark-- Ladies Night at a discotheque. It's not in their blood the way it is for Catwoman...Where is she?
I hate it when you get like this. This Catwoman is becoming an obsession. I say we call it a night. Tomorrow is a big day for us...
I hate it when you get like this. This Catwoman is becoming an obsession. I say we call it a night. Tomorrow is a big day for us...
What's the matter with you, Spooky, my most trusted comrade? We are warriors! These are the challenges we live for!
I want out of tonight's mission. I can't do it anymore, Captain. I can't let innocent people die to prove our superiority..I can't.
Just like a woman. You want out. You're out.
Why are you--I fought for you with honor. Why should it matter if I'm a man or a woman, as long as I'm a good warrior.
Of course it matters! It throws off everything! "Superhero" is manhood's highest achievement. Manhood! Your dirty little secret has diseased us to the core. You were my buddy, my comrade-- women aren't buddies, women aren't warriors! You tried to turn the Cult of Good into some after-work softball team! It's time to get thrown from the treehouse...
I loved you.
I know.
You're not a super-hero. You're not even a hero. You're a scary, sick, fake who made a big mistake. You killed someone very special to me..
And...your point?
Hasn't anyone ever taught you that fighting violence with violence solves nothing.
It's a lot more fun than fighting violence with pamphlets. That voicebox of yours is a hoot. Say "I'm wearing no underwear"--it'll be funny.. You do know you're evil, don't you?

My, those little ears pick up a lot. The Cult of Good will die heroically preventing a world-class heist. Since we will be the ones performing the heist, our deaths will obviously be fake. But have no fear. There will be many other deaths tomorrow...and those will be quite real. I'm afraid these questions of yours put you in a position not unlike a

You've seen me...
How can you say things with such feeling and then turn around and put on a helmet and...Who are you? Were you sitting on my right or my left at the card table? Tell me! Please tell me who you are; you own me that!
I know, I should probably tell you, but I just don't feel like it. To be honest, I'm really angry at you. I admired you so much more when you were purely wicked. I mean, look at you now, running around trying to "get to the bottom" of things. Trying to "save the city." It's true we're about to do a very nasty deed,
I'm supposed to be taking personality tips from you three? You people were once heroes. You had ideals. You fought for things. Spooky told me so...
Do you have any idea how much superheroes get paid? Zilcho. Urban vigilantes with secret identities operating outside the law. Not exactly the stuff of a W-2 form. If it wasn't for merchandising and corruption and these diabolical "missions"...There is no such thing as heroes and villains, anymore, Selina. There are only winners and losers. You lost. We won.
Ah, the good guys always triumph in the end. It's what allows our children to sleep at night.
You can't get away with..
Spooky.
Spear.
Hello, Spooky.
I don't want to hurt you, Catwoman. Yet. After tomorrow, you can do anything you want, but please, just stay out of sight for the next 24 hours. I won't stand by and watch my leader get all emotional over an animal like you. I warn you, don't tempt Captain God when he is angry. Let is complete our mission in peace.

Whatever you say...Sis.
Can't you understand--I got tired of being a woman. I wanted the respect that only a cape, boots, chestplate, and a mechanical spear can bring..
You're not strong. You're scared..scared that someone like me will see right through you. Whatever the Cult of Good was, it's not anymore... You don't have to listen to me, just listen to you..
I heard what you said, Spooky. I can't believe he shot you...
Men, huh?
For when the time comes..
For when the..Uh, yeah, thanks, a little gold piece of...gold. Uh...
For when the..Uh, yeah, thanks, a little gold piece of...gold. Uh...

Ask me another one--
You're late. I've got some good news and some good news. I'm giving you more hours and the new uniforms came in.
What's the good news?
You know, Kyle, you're still pretty hot for a pre-Bicentennial babe...
"Pre-bicentennial babe?"
"Pre-bicentennial babe?"
Yeah, as in born before..Ooh, I suppose it's "sexual harassment" to give a woman a compliment. Sheesh. Come on, gentleman...
There you are, Selina. I've been thinking..I have some.."positions" opening up..
Stop.
Stop.
Oh, what? I offer you a job in implied exchange for physical favors and suddenly it's "sexual harassment..."
Oh, what? I offer you a job in implied exchange for physical favors and suddenly it's "sexual harassment..."
Can I be frank, Frank? Your entire existence is sexual harassment. I accept there's not much you can do about it.
Hey, you're anti-male.
Oh Frank, I'm not anti-male, I'm anti- you. Believe me, there's a difference. Kelly is designing new uniforms for next week. Pay her and thank her. And is it a rule that the hottest places on the planet have the coldest air conditioning. There's something out there called 73 degrees, look into it.

Kelly, get to work on those new uniforms. I'm not running a summer camp here..
A genuine woman of mystery in Oasisburg. Amnesia. Bulletholes in exposed stomach badly concealed with body make-up. Beautiful, intelligent eyes that have no business in "Frank's Fun Palace" or anybody else's Fun Palace for that matter..
Uh. "Thanks?"
I don't know what came over me.
What is it with women and Catwoman? Men have the courtesy to punish the weak, but women love punishing the strong. Don't get me wrong--this Catwoman is a terrifying, subversive menace to everything this community stands for and she must be stopped. It's just, I like her a lot.

Yeah, she's okay.
Yeah, she's okay.
Most articles focus on the first half of her name--describing some feline monster. I want the woman of Catwoman. After all, if it was a man dressed as a cat, the story would be on page 23--just another loony. Oh, I want this one. I want her bad..
Sorry, I get carried away. Once I become interested in someone, I can't stop trying to figure them out...Amnesia victims are challenging..
I actually got some memory back last night.
I actually got some memory back last night.
How much?
How much?
Enough.
Enough.
Oh now this one is mine...
Oh the hand--my grandfather is inventing a new kind of blender and..You know, I realize I've never officially introduced myself...I'm Lewis Lane.
But of course you are.
But of course you are.
I was wondering, if you're not doing anything tonight...

Good morning.

No, of course not. You're listed. Not the hut, exactly, but the rest of..
Well. I'd let you come in, but the place is a mess...
Next time, call...
I thought you'd like a ride to work. You don't own a cat, do you?
Hey, Captain God!
What did--?
What did--?
You turned around!
You turned around!
Yes, you shouted the words "Captain God" at me for no reason...
Yes, you shouted the words "Captain God" at me for no reason...
Oh, do you turn around every time somebody just shouts at you?
Oh, do you turn around every time somebody just shouts at you?
Actually, yes.
Did you try to kill...
What?
What?
Nothing. How's your hand?
Nothing. How's your hand?
About the same. Thanks for asking...Damn blender. Okay, I can't stand it anymore, I'm dying to know--Did you try on some whiskers last night and hit a 7-11 along with all those other women? You had to have thought about it--a Catwoman for a night?

I'm having a hard time picking up your signal this morning--What did you say?

I said I saw you last night. What were you doing hiding in that alley, running off when the superhero alarm sounded...
I was doing my job. At the risk of sounding egotistical, I didn't become the best reporter in the world sitting by the phone. I was chasing tail all night--I was not spying, intentionally, on your hot and heavy date with "Brock Leviathan, architect." I can't believe he ordered white wine. You do know white wine is not real wine...

Hey, I thought...
I'm afraid last night was the last straw of our city's tourists. The Mayor, in his finite wisdom, is throwing a "Month of the Woman" luncheon ball for the public this afternoon to try and calm everyone down. I thought maybe you and I could...
Go together? Sure, why not? Another date with someone who could be an insane messenger of death for all I know. No offense. Hey, lean over, let me smell your breath..Say in a deep voice, "A superhero's job is to protect..."

You're scaring me, Selina. Do it some more.
I give up. I give up.--I can't figure you out. Not gonna try.
You can't figure me out. You're the strange one..
You can't figure me out. You're the strange one..
You are...
You are...
Uh-huh..
Hey, architect--she's joking. Right, Selina? Selina?
I'm not through. This will come as a shock. Again, to one of you. I am Catwoman. The Catwoman.
Some reporter I am..all this time my story is right there in front..I have a lot of questions.
Fine, fine, at a later date, I'll be more than happy to talk about my perverse psychological complexities with the one who's not the creep. But for now, I'm drilling inside your brains...I bring up the whole Catwoman thing for one reason. I bit Captain God in the hand and the next day you both show up equipped with big bandaids and wobbly excuses--
Lose the smile, Mr. Good Reflexes. We were having a pretty okay time the other night--good food, good conversation--some Catwomen show up and it's "You need cab fare?; I got to go to my Hideout--Oh, I'm sorry, I mean "warehouse."
Not too cool...
Not too cool...
Then there's you, Louis, sneaking through back alleys and surprise visiting me at my home..Both of you have been way too frisky from the get- go. I'm actually a pretty amazing person--funny, smart, attractive when I get my sleep--but you two had no way of knowing that-- when I met you both I was basically a morose, depressed amnesiac incapable of any human feeling.
You know, now that I hear myself tell it, I'm thinking maybe both of you are messing with me. What, you get the Helmet Monday through Thursday, then Brock takes it for the weekend...
Okay. Let's get serious. Of course I know the Cult of Good is not good. Ever since I saw what they did in Atlanta, it has been my mission to expose them. I've followed them to Oasisburg and soon will have enough hard evidence to bring them to real justice. That computer disc could be the final piece to the puzzle. This isn't just
Have you seen the Oasisburg Police? They drive golf carts with little red sirens.
We have to do something. What can we do to help, Selina?

I'll let you know.
I'm sorry, ma'am, there are no pets allowed in the library...
But I'm blind.

It's seeing-eye dogs, ma'am. If I let the cat stay, will you go out with me?

What if I say I'll go out with you, so you can have all these great daydreams, but then never actually talk to you again?

Okay, deal.
Okay, deal.
"I'll go out with you." Now go get me these old newspapers...
You're late.
Yes, Mother. Dear.
A hearty breakfast is the start of a great morning...
Oh, I forgot to tell you, you're on a diet...The fact you're still reasonably pretty is the one thing you got going for you.

Is every single thing out of your mouth since your "accident" have to be a monotone mumble of cheap sarcasm?

Maybe.
Maybe.
It's funny, I've heard of giving up finding a man and raising a family to pursue a career. And I've heard of foregoing a career to start a family-- but I think you're onto something new, Selina. "Absolutely nothing"-- Has a ring to it. I think it could catch on...How's that for sarcasm?

Pretty good...Mom, I don't want you to think I don't appreciate...letting me stay, getting me the job--I've been a mess. I'm still a mess. It's just...we have to start having a different conversation. I can't take..
I'll take your abuse, but it's way too early for the sanctimonious Cult of Gag...
Oh, so now even the keepers of the city don't meet your standards...You're late.
Don't sneak up on me...
Uh, it's just--that woman out there-- that horrible Hag. She's the one who keeps following me on her creepy little scooter--And now she's built a hut in the back..Why did you...
Uh, it's just--that woman out there-- that horrible Hag. She's the one who keeps following me on her creepy little scooter--And now she's built a hut in the back..Why did you...
Because she asked me--and I couldn't very well turn her down. Don't you remember-- of course you don't remember--that "Hag" is the one who brought you to that hospital in Gotham City. For what it's worth-- currently not much--we owe her your life...When I think about a single woman in Gotham City--amnesia is probably the best thing that could happen to a girl like
Where were you last night? I didn't hear you come in.
It's because I didn't come in. I live in the Hut, now. I meant to tell you..See ya.
Mom? Oh Mom, I messed up...
What kind of name is "Brock Leviathan?"

I hate it when you let your hair just hang like that...you have such pretty eyes...

Oh pooh, come now. If you turn me down, I just might throw a fit..you know how us girls can be..
What's it like being a superhero? It must be frightfully exciting..How did you guys all get together?
We met on the Internet. The Captain put out a cryptic message calling for a new order of crimefighters. We don't even know each other's true identities...
You seem sad, Spooky.
I'm not sad, no, I owe the Captain my life. It's just you think you want to help prevent crime, but you realize that's too complicated. It's a lot more fun to punish crime. Then after a while, you don't care what's a crime and what's not, what you became a Warrior for. You just want the kicks. The rush.

The kicks..the rush..you mean, like pulling heists..faking your own deaths..killing innocent bystanders...like Mexican angels. I know you're a woman. Do you?
You're the One. I thought I told you to stay hidden behind the couch, CAT! You've torn the unit apart. You've driven a great leader insane...
You going to talk all day?
Nice breasts.
Thanks.
Hey Buddy! Can you let me pull over? Give me some space to pull over.
Where do you think you're going?

Was someone in an accident?
Do I hear a woman's voice?
I'm sorry for whatever's happened to you but we're definitely not the right people to do you any good.
Don't you have children?
Don't you have children?
Matter of fact I did have a kid once. But he's a lot better off with his father in Milwaukee.
What are you doing on Theo's line?
Taking messages.
Taking messages.
He ran out on me to be with you? Well fuck him! Everything worked twice as good without him. We didn't need him then and I don't need him now.

I won't let him. He belongs to me now. Bye, sweetie.
Be careful. There were people in that crosswalk.
That's all we need. Better let me drive.
Have you got to tell her your life story?
This is my conversation. I'll say what I fucking please.
This is my conversation. I'll say what I fucking please.
Wake up. Make a right at Ocean Avenue. The hotel's a few blocks up on the left.
What if they do question the authenticity?
Oh. Seems yours girlfriend is casting doubts on your expertise.

I am not! Fuck you! Theo's a genius.
I am not! Fuck you! Theo's a genius.
Any trouble, we whip out our Treasury Department badges -- show them the wire I'm wearing and read them their rights. Theo seizes the Krugerands as evidence. Naturally they start negotiating. Offer to give us up somebody else. And we listen. Take notes on who bought what stolen art and tell them we have to clear it with our superiors at Justice. We pick
Who's on the phone?
I'll explain later. I'm sort of on hold.
What was that for?
You could've made me lose my call.

He's at it again. Like that night at the Emerald. This piece of Euro-trash is slapping shit out of his little wife in a back booth -- so Mr. Good Deed here has got to step in and pound the fucker's head into the wall. Meantime "Wifey" recovers enough to pull off her high heel and nearly take our hero's eye out. It took

How was I in the wrong?
I know where it is. Give me that phone back.
I'm not finished. Under other circumstances I'd gladly go out of my way. I don't understand why you just don't phone some other person.

She can't! It's busted. Now hand that on back!

Theo wants to talk again.
Theo wants to talk again.
Did you have to tell her my name?
Will you two cut it out?
This Mercedes of yours, what's it look like?
He's right, Theo. She might not be around to back up your story. You could end up in the middle of this.
Look -- I've got the lives of maybe three innocent people hanging on the end of this line.
I know you feel awful but it's not your responsibility.
Then whose is it?
Then whose is it?
You gotta just look the other way.
You gotta just look the other way.
I'm sorry. You'll do all right without me. Keep my share.

I'm not staying in here with him puking all over the place. Get this door open!
Now that'd be a misdemeanor.
I got to get going. An agent is showing me a house up on Broad Beach in ten minutes.
I got to get going. An agent is showing me a house up on Broad Beach in ten minutes.
They'll wait. Meantime, raise the lid.
What'd you do? Tail me from Brentwood?
Why would I do that?
Let's have your license, mister.
I'm going to level with you officer.
What's this?
See for yourself, federal agent, U.S. Treasury. On the job.
Lady, don't let him do it!
You got it wrong. I'm the one that's on your side.
You got it wrong. I'm the one that's on your side.
You almost brain me and lock me in a fucking trunk and you're on my side? You stupid fuck!
Nels reporting in. Sit down where you are. Arms folded.
Yes sir.
In case you crapped out it was my job to go after that briefcase.
Or relieve me of it later.
Or relieve me of it later.
Only I was sloppy. I let you take me out. That was quite a humiliation.
You missed.
Any time you decide to let me in on it.
How do we get back to the freeway?
Bear right till the fire road ends. It's not far.
Yeah, I suppose getting whacked has got to be one of your best ways to die. Particularly if you're not expecting it. You don't know what hit you.
Can you make him stop!
Can you make him stop!
Mind letting me make the best of a rotten situation?
Which is why we had a lot more to worry about than the law. These are people who don't worry about reading you your rights.
I'm the one they'd be looking for.
I told you I should've cuffed him.
I want the gun emptied. I want to see all six slugs tossed up here. And then I want out. That's all. <u>OUT</u>!
He's seen both of us now.
Look, I've got a wife. I don't care if either of you ever get caught.
Look, I've got a wife. I don't care if either of you ever get caught.
What else did you expect him to say? Do it, Theo -- or give me the gun.
It took you long enough to get my ass out.
With all those holes Nels pumped in I knew you wouldn't suffocate.
With all those holes Nels pumped in I knew you wouldn't suffocate.
You can tell she was really worried about me.
I prefer to have the sucker die at a more convenient location. Once Nels arrives with his backpack full of goodies.
So Theo and Nels will appear to have whacked each other out and we never existed. A thing of beauty. Jesus, the shit you come up with!
Now turn around. I'm going to cuff you.
Put those away. We can't have marks on his wrists.
Put those away. We can't have marks on his wrists.

Wait! I hear her breathing now. There, she just picked it up again.
What do you mean tip the cops? Is the man a lunatic or what?
Will you relax? This in no way affects our business. Go on.
Just hand up on the bitch! Fuck you, madam. And goodbye!
That's what I deserve for listening in the first place.
I don't like anybody laying their hands on me.

Okay, okay, Lenore, calm down. Either let me call the school or better yet, the F.B.I.
Sure -- and they record your voice. And later on we all get slammed for kidnap and murder. That's out!
I thought you said you could handle him.
I'm doing fine. Theo wants to deal.
Nels, don't let that cop pass you.
What am I supposed to do?
Lose the hardware now.
We'll toss it when we make the blind curve.
Don't fuck around. Pop a cap in him.
Allow me.
He took it like a man. Toss him in that drainage ditch.
