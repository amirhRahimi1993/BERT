Suspicion of what?
Makin' wine in the basement. He looks like that wop stooge used to drive for the Fracisi brothers.
No sir -- this is where Joel lives.
He was the bank on that shipment outta Mexico three years ago.
What the hell am I drivin' for? I'm a first grade Detective. You're a second grade guinea.
I'm wounded. Oh, oh.

We're goin' now! Goodbye.
We got information that there's no shit in the street -- it's like a desert full of junkies with a big score coming in to make everybody well.
This could be it, Walter. This Candy Store guy, putting on a big show in a fancy nightclub with known connections all over him. Then on our own, after working the whole day and night, we tail him out to Brooklyn and sit on him for a week practically, and who do we come up with? Joel Weinstock. You gotta let us have it.
Popeye.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's Cloudy. Open the door.

We also got Bill Mulderig and Phil Klein.
Throw 'em in the bathroom, will you? How good are the warrants?
Sixty days. Here. Don't mention it.

The other guy's a frog too. Checked in at the Edison. Had a hooker sent up.
What about Sal?
We put him to bed for the night.
This fella Nicoli's got a record in France, Walter. He's wanted for questioning in the murder of a French cop.
I say we keep sittin' on Boca.
My ass. The only reason you're in this is because you've got a big expense account for buying junk and you like to see your picture in the papers.
This is my case. Get these guys off my back and let me handle it.

There are four auto graveyards like this one in the other boroughs, handling about a thousand vehicles a month. Those that aren't claimed are auctioned here once a month.

Darling, may I have this one?

The river at this point is the most dangerous on the East Coast. Years ago, hundreds of ships went down here.
I'm afraid the rest of Ward's Island isn't nearly as romantic - a pollution plant, a hospital, a training school for garbage men and that area over there, where the old cars are kept, prior to being processed for shipment to, among other places, The Charnier Shipping Company, of Marseilles, France.

He could go someplace else with his sixty kilos of heroin and see how easy it is to pull together a half million cash. He wouldn't find there was any hurry to do this kind of business.

What if I could prove it to you, Satch?
How's that?

I do know. I'm a cop. This is what I do.
You ever talk to a victim's family? The one's left behind? They don't act like what you'd think. There's panic and fear. But mostly, it's like there's this logic problem. And if they could only solve it, everything would be okay. But if you look real close - look at their eyes - you can see it. Just a glimmer. But somewhere they know.
What if the radio stops working? Christ, what if I can't reach you again?
What if the radio stops working? Christ, what if I can't reach you again?
Then you get Mom the hell out. But Dad, those other women weren't supposed to die. We don't try to stop this guy, we're gonna live with that for the rest of our lives.
Why not just get the cops to watch the bar?
They'll question her. Whatever they tell her could change what happens. No, I want you to follow her. See if anybody's watching her, hittin' on her. I'm betting somebody's gonna walk outta that bar with her. When they do, you call the cops.
What do I tell them?
Tell 'em there's a homicide in progress... cause by the time they show up there will be.
I'll be damned.
Did you see him? Do you know who he is?
Did you see him? Do you know who he is?
No. I just kept talking to her. There was a lot of guys in that bar - could'a been any of 'em.

Sissy Clark, 190 Riverside Dr., apartment 3C. Tomorrow. She's a nursing student. Paying her way as a cocktail waitress at the Peppermint Lounge, on west 63rd. Left work at two A M...killed in her apartment, between two thirty and five.
Got it.
Dad, I think I may be able to get you enough information to make sure the DA can nail this bastard.

How?
How?
Coupla days ago they dug up a body in Washington Heights - Mary Finelli. Girl disappeared in '68. Turns out she was his first kill. Which means he probably knew her. Most serials know their first victim. I'm gonna do some checking - see if I can put any of this together...

All right, I'm with you. I just hope we know what the hell we're doing.
Tell me something good, Chief. Tell me about the future.
Well they found out cigarettes give you lung cancer.
What else, John. It must be different, huh? Are people living on the moon?
Didn't happen, we got enough problems down here.
Didn't happen, we got enough problems down here.
What are we like in...1998?

You really wanna know?

Yeah, you betcha.
Yeah, you betcha.
Well, game five was the big one. It turned in the bottom of the 6th. We were down 3-0. Cleon Jones gets hit on the foot - left a scuff mark on the ball. Clendenon comes up. The count goes to 2 2. High fastball. He nailed it. Weis slammed a solo shot in the 7th to tie. Jones and Swoboda scored in the

H-hi.
John, you still there?
I'm right here, Dad.
I'm right here, Dad.
You all right?
You all right?
Yeah, I think so...
Yeah, I think so...
Don't worry, Chief. I'm not gonna let anything happen to her...no matter what.
He killed her John. He killed her and I didn't do a thing to stop it.
It's not your fault, Dad.
It's not your fault, Dad.
Yes it is...we did this. We changed everything. I've been having bad dreams, Johnny. Dreams where I die...in the fire. I was supposed to die in that warehouse.
Yes it is...we did this. We changed everything. I've been having bad dreams, Johnny. Dreams where I die...in the fire. I was supposed to die in that warehouse.
No.
This is wrong...it's like we cheated...
I know... But Dad, you can't go back. You didn't die in that fire. And no matter what you do, nothing is gonna change that. So all we can do is deal with this...and try to make it right.
I know... But Dad, you can't go back. You didn't die in that fire. And no matter what you do, nothing is gonna change that. So all we can do is deal with this...and try to make it right.
I don't think I can. I'm not a cop. I can't. I can't stop this guy.
I don't think I can. I'm not a cop. I can't. I can't stop this guy.
But we can, we can do it together. Spirit and guts, remember?
But we can, we can do it together. Spirit and guts, remember?
Johnny, I know, but...
I need you to believe in me. To believe that we can do this.
John, he's got my driver's license.

Please, Dad, just do it.

Right, now I need you to tape it up on the outside, where he touched it, so the prints keep.
Right, now I need you to tape it up on the outside, where he touched it, so the prints keep.
Huh?
It's gonna work, Dad. We're gonna stop him.
Hang on.
You're telling me this maniac is a cop? What the hell am I supposed to do with that one?
Call the FBI. Use a pay phone. Don't give 'em your name, Dad. Just tell 'em that it was Shepard who killed Finelli and Clark and the others. That he's the Nightingale.
What are you doing here, Satch? You off today?
Dad, you there?
Dad, what the hell is going on?
Just a minute, John...okay? Don't go away.
John, you there?
Yeah, Dad. What the hell is going on?
Yeah, Dad. What the hell is going on?
Satch is busting me for Sissy Clark's murder. John...
I'm here, Dad. I'm here.
We did it, John. We stopped him.
Wait. Something's wrong. I don't...
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
I don't remember. Why don't I remember?
I'm not your uncle, kid. Gordo, what are you doing here?
Sully! Is that you?
Hey, Sull. My cable's out again.
What the hell is that smell?
Hey, OK if Gordy uses your old gear?
I think it's somewhere in the closet... if you can find it.
Sull! What the hell!
I talked to him Gordo. I talked to my Dad.
C'mon, man. Get inside. I'll come over. We'll play some Nintendo.
No. I gotta tell him the address, so he doesn't go in.
No. I gotta tell him the address, so he doesn't go in.
Go in where?
Go in where?
The warehouse. Buxton seeds. It's tomorrow.
The warehouse. Buxton seeds. It's tomorrow.
I know pal. I remember. Twenty-nine years tomorrow.
How you feeling?
Better.
John. John, you all right?
Longbranch...?
Longbranch...?
What?
My father didn't die in a fire?
Huh?
Huh?
My father didn't die in a fire?
My father didn't die in a fire?
Fire? What are you talking about? He had cancer, John.
Fire? What are you talking about? He had cancer, John.
Cancer. It was the cigarettes. Right? The cigarettes?
Cancer. It was the cigarettes. Right? The cigarettes?
Yeah, lung cancer. Ten years ago.
Huh?
The Ham radio. That's how come he didn't die in the fire.
This is the Space Cowboy. I'm an intergalactic traveler from the Federation planet earth.
Gordo?
Gordo?
How'd you know my name, mister?
I better give you my address then.
Oh don't worry kid, I know where you live. Now I want you to go upstairs and write this down, buy Yahoo. You got that Space Cowboy. Y-a-h-o-o. It's a magic word and I never want you to forget it.
Oh don't worry kid, I know where you live. Now I want you to go upstairs and write this down, buy Yahoo. You got that Space Cowboy. Y-a-h-o-o. It's a magic word and I never want you to forget it.
You got a deal, mister. I mean Santa.
Don't choke on your pride, Sull. You ain't ever gonna catch another one like that.
She made up her mind. Nothin' I do is gonna change it.
She made up her mind. Nothin' I do is gonna change it.
Nothing you're willing to do.
You're not looking too good.
Whoa, I just...I just...
Maybe you outta lay off a little...
Gordo, I wasn't dreaming. I talked to him, it was real.
Another rough night, huh? That it?
Yeah. That's it.
This is getting real old, John. And I'm tired up to here with it...
I'm sorry. I just...you know...I...
I'm sorry. I just...you know...I...
And I'm tired of the I'm sorrys. I don't need 'em. What I need is a partner I can count on. I care about you. Not cause of me and your old man. Not cause of your mom. But because of you.
She makes ten.
Ten? No. I remember this case. Three. He killed three women.
Ten? No. I remember this case. Three. He killed three women.
What're you talking'? You know better than anybody, John. You've read this file a thousand times.
That's what we need here, Satch. A lucky break.
That wasn't luck, Johnny boy. That was smarts and ten plus on the job.
Our lucky break. Mario ID'd the dental. Mary Finelli...reported missing April 16, 1968.
April 16...? That means she was the first.
April 16...? That means she was the first.
Which means he probably knew her.
Which means he probably knew her.
This case just got hot. We pull on this string...
Okay, lemme walk you through it.
Mind if I shake it off first...so's I can concentrate better.
I ran him through BCI...got a hit. Busted for sexual assault: March 22, 1970. Eight days after the last Nightingale murder.
So you figure the murders stop 'cause he's off the street. Then by the time he gets paroled, he's smartened up enough to control himself?
So you figure the murders stop 'cause he's off the street. Then by the time he gets paroled, he's smartened up enough to control himself?
Not the first time that's been true. I'm telling you, I got a feeling about this guy. This is the guy, Satch.
Not the first time that's been true. I'm telling you, I got a feeling about this guy. This is the guy, Satch.
Uh, huh.
Uh, huh.
What?
What?
I'm just trying to figure what interests me more: the possibility that Daryl is the guy, or you making him absolutely the guy.
Got a minute?
Yeah. Sure.
He ain't our guy, John.
Just cause he didn't want to look at the photos doesn't mean he isn't the doer. Not everyone fits the profile.
Hi, this is Julia. Please leave a message after the tone.
Hey, Ma, it's me. Checking in. Probably at work. Anyways, I'll see you tomorrow night. Love you.
I thought it'd be nicer to eat here.
Sounds good.
Sounds good.
I'm sorry Sam couldn't make it.
I'm sorry Sam couldn't make it.
Yeah, those grad school applications are driving her crazy.
I'm sure everything'll work out. She really loves you...
So how are things at the hospital?

Fine. You know Dr. Schwartz retired last month?

No kidd'n, he musta been pushing 90!

Close.
So how'd you like LION KING?
Oh, I loved it. I wish you'd gone.
Oh, I loved it. I wish you'd gone.
I know. I'm sorry. Work.
I know. I'm sorry. Work.
You work too hard, John.
You work too hard, John.
Look who's talking.
Hey, future boy. Frank tells me you're a cop?
Yeah, that's right.
My six year-old here keeps telling me he wants to be a policeman. Right after he retires from the majors. We just gave him a badge and a whistle for his birthday.
Yeah...I remember. I used to play cops and robbers but y-- ...my mom wouldn't let me have a toy gun.
Yeah...I remember. I used to play cops and robbers but y-- ...my mom wouldn't let me have a toy gun.
You're mom sounds like she's got some smarts.
You're mom sounds like she's got some smarts.
She's pretty special.
She's pretty special.
Are you a good cop, John?
Are you a good cop, John?
I try to be.
I try to be.
Then I'll bet she's real proud of you, huh?
Then I'll bet she's real proud of you, huh?
Yeah. I just wish I'd told her how proud I was of her.
Yeah. I just wish I'd told her how proud I was of her.
I'm sorry. I didn't realize... But she knew, John. A mother knows what's in her son's heart.
Just came by to wrap up over there. Thought I'd say "hello."
Glad you did. Come on in. Buy you a cup of coffee?
Wife around?
No. No. Well, sort of. In my heart. Been dead 29 years.
No. No. Well, sort of. In my heart. Been dead 29 years.
Oh. Sorry. How so?
You used to be on the job?
Yeah, long time ago. I know you?
Yeah, long time ago. I know you?
I look familiar?
I look familiar?
No. What house you work?
The 2-3. Homicide.
A hot shot, huh?
A hot shot, huh?
Nah, just working the job.
Nah, just working the job.
I hear that.
I hear that.
As a matter of fact, I caught a case that goes back to your day...one of the Nightingale murders.
No kiddin'?
No. Missing teenager. Disappeared thirty years ago. Found her bones last week. Buried behind some old diner, up by Dyckman street. Mary Finelli.
Huh.
Talk about dumb luck. Odds of anybody finding that girl, thirty years later. And then the chances of hitting a dental...forget about it. Bets part is she's the first victim. She knew the doer. I'm betting those bones are gonna do a lot of talking.
Who are you?
I'm the train wreck you didn't see coming. And I'm gonna steal your life away. You went down 30 years ago. You just don't know it yet.
Hell-
You have the right to remain silent. If you give up that right...
Who the fuck is this?
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.

Fuck you, asshole.

It's a small world, Carl. And I'm gonna find you. Real soon.
My name is Abel. And I am my brother's keeper.
Where are you going?
Where are you going?
Going? How do you mean?
Going? How do you mean?
I mean, is there any place in particular where we can drop you off?

What is that?
I found this today. There were other pieces of the body lying there, but I believe "he" wanted me to have this...
I found this today. There were other pieces of the body lying there, but I believe "he" wanted me to have this...
That's an eyeball! Oh, God!
That's an eyeball! Oh, God!
"He" wanted me to warn you. Look at this, all of you!
Dammit Shelly! Why do you always have to be such an asshole!
I beg your pardon, I'm not an asshole. I'm an actor.
I beg your pardon, I'm not an asshole. I'm an actor.
Same thing.
Look Shelly, you're my roommate and I like you... most of the time. But you gotta stop doing these things. Now, I set this date up for you, didn't I? So don't embarrass me. When you meet this woman, just relax and be yourself.
Would you be yourself... ...if you looked this this?
No more... I can't!
Yes, you can. Come on, Shelly!
Who brought up this bright idea?
We were looking for something to keep our hands busy. It was either this or an orgy. Vera chose this. What're ya gonna do?
... One thousand twelve... one thousand thirteen... one thousand fourteen... What's the World's Record for this?
According to the Guinness Book, you passed the World's Record several whacks ago.
According to the Guinness Book, you passed the World's Record several whacks ago.
I did?! I broke the world's record.
You're all just jealous.
Actually, I have no idea what the World's Record is. I was just kidding.
What're you gonna do?
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
So what would a weekend in the country be without sex?
Cool it, Andy.
Cool it, Andy.
I didn't mean it the way it sounded...
Breakfast?
No way. We're pregnant. Remember?
What was that?
Where's Shelly?
Why don't we go take a swim?
I don't know...
I don't know...
We'd be all alone. We could do anything we wanted and nobody would see.
We'd be all alone. We could do anything we wanted and nobody would see.
Sounds disgusting. Let's go.
What're you doing?
We haven't looked in the barn, yet. Let's take a look.
We haven't looked in the barn, yet. Let's take a look.
Not now. I'm cold.
How about a roll in the hay?
You can play with yourself, 'cause I'm going in the house.
How about you and I whacking a couple of balls around?
If you insist.
How do we do it?
First we take off our clothes, then you get on top of me or I get on top of you...
First we take off our clothes, then you get on top of me or I get on top of you...
I know how to do it. I mean, how do we do it in the hammock?
Think you can figure it out?
I'll think of something.
That was the best yet. Was it you... me... or the hammock?
I vote for me.
I vote for me.
I vote for the hammock.
What're you doin'?
I think it's called "a shower". You might try it sometime.
I think it's called "a shower". You might try it sometime.
You're too clean for me.
Hey Deb... can you hear me?
Barely.
Barely.
I'm going downstairs to get a beer. You want one?
I'm going downstairs to get a beer. You want one?
What?
Do you want a beer or not?
Sure.
Destroy the evidence? No, man!
Yes, man!
I'm gonna be sicker than all of you, man. Now I gotta spend the whole weekend totally straight... I don't think I can make it, man!
Chuck... look.
I'm a slow eater.
I love you, man!
It's dark down there.
That's the way it is, man. Cellars are dark.
That's the way it is, man. Cellars are dark.
And Hell is hot, but I ain't goin' down there either.
Maybe we should do some exercise.
This is all the exercise I need...
I can't find the bong anywhere. Can't you remember where you dropped it?
I can't even remember what day it is, man.
I can't even remember what day it is, man.
It's Friday the 13th.
What's the matter?!
Nothin'. I was just foolin' around.
Nothin'. I was just foolin' around.
Don't do that to me!
Here. Go down the cellar and check the fusebox.
Will you come with me?
Will you come with me?
Be a man, man.
Which one is it?
It's the last house on the left. She lives downstairs.
I appreciate the fact that you worry about me, but don't.
Okay, we won't. We'll just have fun, all agreed?
What are they saying?
I don't know. I flunked Spanish.
Come on down!
You go ahead...
What's this?
Your bed.
Your bed.
A hammock?
A hammock?
Have you ever made love in a hammock?
Derek... stop.
Why?
You know what I've been through. Don't ever scare me like that.
I'm sorry. I just wanted to surprise you. What can I say?
I'm sorry. I just wanted to surprise you. What can I say?
You can say... "Hello, how are you?"... for starters.
You can say... "Hello, how are you?"... for starters.
Hello. How are you?
You haven't changed a bit. Always so sure of yourself. Even when we were kids, when you wanted something, nothing could stop you.
Is that so bad?
Is that so bad?
I don't know.
I don't know.
You're irresistible. I lose control.
You're irresistible. I lose control.
Just slow down. Let me get to know you again. Let me get to know this place again.
Just slow down. Let me get to know you again. Let me get to know this place again.
Okay. There's a whole weekend ahead of us. There's time.
This door was open just a minute ago, wasn't it?
What?
What?
Nothing.
Look what I found. Remember these?
Did you stay here last night?
Did you stay here last night?
No. I got here just before you did.
No. I got here just before you did.
Somebody was in here.
Somebody was in here.
Goldilocks and the Three Bears?
Goldilocks and the Three Bears?
I'm serious. Doesn't this look a little strange to you?
Shelly! Where are you?!
Are you all right, Shelly?
Let's spread out and check all the rooms. Outside, too. You stay with me.
No. I can look around by myself. I'll take the upstairs.
This is too painful to look at.
Why don't we drive over to the cove and watch the sunset. It'll mellow you out.
You know, I'm not sure I could live anywhere else. The nights are always so peaceful and quiet.
It's deceiving.
It's deceiving.
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
The quiet can fool you. It fooled me. You can never be sure of what's out there.
Why did you come back here?
... To prove something to myself... to prove I'm stronger than I think I am.
... To prove something to myself... to prove I'm stronger than I think I am.
And, what about us?
And, what about us?
I'm here with you. Can't that be enough for now?
I'm here with you. Can't that be enough for now?
I don't know. I don't see you for months on end, and when I do, you put this wall between us. How do I break through?
I don't know. I don't see you for months on end, and when I do, you put this wall between us. How do I break through?
I'm trying. I'm really trying.
What happened that night?
You promised you'd never ask me.
You promised you'd never ask me.
After you left me that night, I didn't see you or talk to you again for a year. No one would tell me anything. All I know is what the police told me. We have nowhere to go unless you let me in. What happened?
When you dropped me off at the house, it was very late. My parents were waiting up for me. As soon as I got in the door, they starting yelling and cursing at me. I was so upset... I told them I slept with you. My mothers slapped me. That was the first time she'd ever hit me. I couldn't believe it. I ran
It's all right, you're all right. I'm with you.
Could we move a little faster?
Sure, just watch where you're going.
You know him?
Sort of.
Hi.
You're Shelly?
You're Shelly?
I'm sorry.
What d'ya got in there?
My whole world.
My whole world.
In that little thing?
In that little thing?
Stick around and you'll see.
What are we gonna do?
Destroy the evidence, Pronto!
Faster! Eat faster!
Why don't you help us?
Why don't you help us?
Uh... I guess I'm just not hungry.
That scarecrow? Can't you tell how weird his is just by looking at him.
Come on, Shelly. Who else is gonna give him a lift?
Come on, Shelly. Who else is gonna give him a lift?
Not us! He's really creepy.
Is... is everything all right?
Everything's gonna be fine.
Everything's gonna be fine.
Excuse me, but I believe that's mine...
Please... be cool.
May be please have the wallet.
Are they following us?
Yes.
Yes.
Gulp!
See anything?
Just a dirty window. Next time, I'll know how to handle a situation like that. Let's just hope that "next time" isn't too soon.
Just a dirty window. Next time, I'll know how to handle a situation like that. Let's just hope that "next time" isn't too soon.
Stop worrying. I don't think they'll bother to come after us.
I don't see anything.
Keep looking.
Got any good ideas?
Maybe.
This is no time to celebrate!
Just keep your eyes on the road.
What're you doing?
No time to explain. Just listen. When I yell "stop," you jam on the brakes as hard as you can. Okay?
No time to explain. Just listen. When I yell "stop," you jam on the brakes as hard as you can. Okay?
You're the boss.
Bullseye!
Stop the car! Now!!
This has been on helluva beginning to a quiet weekend in the country.
Look at it this way... things can only get better... Right?
We had a slight misunderstanding with that motorcycle gang... ... but Shelly made them see the error of their ways.
It was nothing.
We're really sorry, but it wasn't our fault.
A few minor repairs and it'll be as good as new.
Vera... you and I have had a chance to really get to know one another today. I like you... very much. I was thinking that maybe.
Don't say any more.
You've just learned a valuable lesson. A beautiful girl like you should never go out in the dark alone.
Damn you, Shelly!
Why do you do these stupid things?!
I have to.
I have to.
You don't "have to."
You don't "have to."
I just want you to like me.
I just want you to like me.
I do like you. But not when you act like a jerk.
I do like you. But not when you act like a jerk.
Being a jerk is better than being nothing.

I never said you were "nothing".
I never said you were "nothing".
You don't to say it. I can tell.
You don't to say it. I can tell.
You're wrong.
I thought that was the end of the song.
Great. Just great.
If this thing is burned out, friggin' Horace will ground my butt.
Who's Horace?
Who's Horace?
My friggin' stepfather and asshole- in-residence.
What?
Go out and plug the cord back in.
Go out and plug the cord back in.
What? Who pulled it out?!
Will you hurry up! I gotta get this fuckmobile back before Horace finds out I took it.
Alright, alright.
That's it. Pull over. I'm drivin'.
No way... ...I wanna rock!
Will you slow down? It's hard enough to read this thing.
Well, who told me to take this cow path?
Well, who told me to take this cow path?
You admit the sign did say "Camp Forest Green," with an arrow pointing this way.
You admit the sign did say "Camp Forest Green," with an arrow pointing this way.
I admit nothing without talking to my lawyer.
Darren, we better turn around.
Why?
Why?
Why? Because I've seen enough horror movies to know masked weirdos are never friendly.
Yeah... We're gonna scare him.
We're gonna scare him?!
That's right. Just drive toward him. He'll move. Nobody wants to die.
That's a freakin' fact. Least of all us.
That's a freakin' fact. Least of all us.
Just drive. He'll get out of our way.
Oh, jeez.
That's it. We're driving this baby back to town... in reverse.
Don't worry about it. Just stay cool.
Stay cool? You ain't Dirty Harry. Now stop it.
It's kinda frightening to think that a kid like that can go so far over the edge. Jason really screwed up the poor sonofabitch's mind.
He really believes Jason's still alive, doesn't he?
He really believes Jason's still alive, doesn't he?
But that's no what worries me the most...It's how far he'll go to try and prove it.
I'm getting real tired of this maniac.
Maybe we better call that psychiatric clinic.
Maybe we better call that psychiatric clinic.
Better call an ambulance first.
Is that all you found?
I wish it was.
Better get out the Hefty Bags... Looks like our boy desperately wants us to believe his story.
He sure chose the right day to pull this shit.
He sure chose the right day to pull this shit.
Whaddya mean?
Whaddya mean?
Happy Friday the 13th.
You just sit tight, Jason. Once the authorities from Carpenter get here, you'll...
Sheriff, you better take this.
....with a woman's touch.
Now wait a second! I thought Burt shot you.
Now wait a second! I thought Burt shot you.
See any paint?... ...Sorry, guys, I did in Mr. Commando. Survival is the name of the game, and that flag is mine.
Come on, you guys! The game's over!!
You don't know for sure. What about Roy? Nobody's seen him.
You don't know for sure. What about Roy? Nobody's seen him.
Of course not. If he hasn't already accidentally pelleted himself, I'm sure he's lost.
Of course not. If he hasn't already accidentally pelleted himself, I'm sure he's lost.
Yeah, but the game's not over until it's over.
Ahh, nothing.
I could swear I heard...
Once we nail Roy, that's it. Victory is ours.
This is taking forever. I'm starving.
This is taking forever. I'm starving.
That's your problem, Larry. That's why your sales are always below quota. Your instinct to eat is stronger than your instinct to win.
That's your problem, Larry. That's why your sales are always below quota. Your instinct to eat is stronger than your instinct to win.
My ass.
My ass.
Yeah, that's fat too.
You become a whole other person when you're out here, Stan. And I don't like it.
This is a man's game. Requiring a man's cunning and intelligence...
Never should've let her play.
It's a damn company executive game, and she's a damn company exec.
Come on, Dad. You could have Rick drive down Cunningham Road and look for them.
Megan, my deputies have more important things to do than look for camp counselors with car trouble.
Jason who?
Megan, get away from him. He's dangerous.
But, Dad, we...
Megan, take your friends back to the camp. I'll let you know if I hear anything about your counselors.
When are you going to stop treating me like one!
When you stop acting like one... Tommy Jarvis is a very sick boy. And you...
When you stop acting like one... Tommy Jarvis is a very sick boy. And you...
How do you know? Did you take his temperature?
How do you know? Did you take his temperature?
You watch that smart-mouthing, young lady.
What it is?
Not what...who. Seems your boyfriend wants people to believe Jason has returned.
Not what...who. Seems your boyfriend wants people to believe Jason has returned.
I thought Jason was only a legend?
I thought Jason was only a legend?
He is. Only Tommy wants to prove the legend is true... ...You stay put. And I'm not kidding.
...And I said, shut up!
All he's asking is for you to check it out.
Can't you at least call the camp and make sure everything's all right?
We have! Trying to track you down. The phone there is disconnected.
Rick. Keep and eye on our wacko kid. I'll be back as soon as I can.
Daddy, what is going on?
Daddy, what is going on?
And make sure my daughter stays put... ...She's grounded.
No. No, it's not...
Yes, Megan. Tommy Jarvis is a killer. A very deranged boy who wants you to believe that...
Yeah, hi. Listen, I've got to talk to your dad. About Jason. I've got a plan. I need to buy some things first but mainly need help to...
Tommy, my father is out looking for you right now. Something happened tonight and he's sure you're responsible. If he finds you, he'll...
Tommy, my father is out looking for you right now. Something happened tonight and he's sure you're responsible. If he finds you, he'll...
I already have a very good idea what could've happened... ...Megan, Jason is out there. He has to be stopped. I'm positive he's heading back to the lake area. He'll keep killing until...
What?
Hide it behind the gas station. Then we can get the hell out of here.
Didn't you say you needed some supplies to do this?
Uh...yes. But...
Uh...yes. But...
Then let's get goin'. We can argue on the way. You tell me what you need... ...I'll make sure you get in.
You got it. Just keep an eye out for roadblocks.
Okay. There's one.
It's all over.
It's just beginning.
So what are ya drawin'?
What's it to ya?
There...Ya happy?
No.
No.
Why?
Why?
'Cause it stinks.
Okay, give it back.
Come and get it.
Sorry, Megan. Not this time.
Wait a minute. I just...
Wait a minute. I just...
I thank you for getting me out. But I gotta finish what I started.
Are you sure this is gonna work? I mean, why didn't we bring that gun and just blast him away?
It probably wouldn't have any effect on him. The only sure way to stop Jason is to return him to his original resting place, where he drowned in 1957.

Lake Forest Green?
Lake Forest Green?
Crystal Lake...where the nightmare began.
They did show up. Isn't that great?
I hope so.
Whew...Okay, hand me those padlocks.
Did you hear me?!
Did you hear me?!
Yes. And I said, hand me those padlocks.
So what happened?
There was this monster. He was after me. He wanted to kill me.
You mean you had a bad dream.
No, he was real. Like on TV.
Okay, listen...what's your name, sweetie?
Nancy.
Nancy.
Well, Nancy, I'm Paula... remember? This is Sissy, and we're gonna be right out there all night so nothing can hurt you. Okay?...
...Good. So no more bad dreams can come around here, huh?
No more.
Where'd you get this?
I found it outside.
You know what? Sissy and Cort are playing jokes. You know, trying to scare each other.
Why?
Why?
Well, grown-ups think it's funny to be scared.
Well, grown-ups think it's funny to be scared.
Are they grown-ups?
Are they grown-ups?
That's debatable.
That's debatable.
Huh?
I can't believe no one called back. I better...
Who ya calling?
But what if they try and scare us?
We'll scare 'em right back.
I'm sure Cort and Sissy are back in their cabins. So you just go back to sleep and don't worry.
But what I get scared again?
But what I get scared again?
Shhh...You know what I used to do when I was a little girl when I got scared?
It's just that Darren and Lizbeth are in charge of organizing and setting up the new campgrounds.
All the little kids arrive today. We're not ready to deal with that alone.
So where's Cort gone off to?
Are you ready? He's taken our young men off to teach them my favorites sport.
Are you ready? He's taken our young men off to teach them my favorites sport.
Which is?
Which is?
Boy scouting.
Boy scouting.
You gotta be kidding!
Okay, okay. I suggest that the crime was committed in the bedroom, by Colonel Mustard, with the knife.
Huh? Oh, come on, Sis. I'm tellin' ya, we can't play Clue with just two people.
Huh? Oh, come on, Sis. I'm tellin' ya, we can't play Clue with just two people.
Why not? I used to play it alone. I love murder games. Have you ever played The Consulting Detective?
Why not? I used to play it alone. I love murder games. Have you ever played The Consulting Detective?
No...Did Megan say when she's coming back from her...visit?
No...Did Megan say when she's coming back from her...visit?
Of course not. She probably took him a loaf of bread with a saw hidden in it. I still don't get it. Why him? I mean, he's cute alright, but...
Hi. Everything's all right now. We're here.
Yeah, we're here.
I just realized something. Where's Cort? I haven't seen him for hours.
I don't know. He called somebody, then took off.
I don't know. He called somebody, then took off.
He didn't say anything?
He didn't say anything?
Yeah, he was gonna check out "things that go bump in the night."
What's goin' on?
I think somebody's messin' around out there.
Now you better cool out a minute, boy. You already almost got your head blown to pieces.
Will you listen, dammit!
Will you listen, dammit!
Don't piss me off, junior. Or I will repaint this office with your brains.
Jason is alive. We dug up his body. I was gonna cremate it and...
Hold it. Whoa... What's your name, son?
Hold it. Whoa... What's your name, son?
Tommy Jarvis. We gotta do something. He's even more powerful now that...
Aren't you the kid whose mother and friends were....
Yeah. Jason murdered them and...
Yeah. Jason murdered them and...
And you've been at some psychiatric clinic ever since, haven't you?
And you've been at some psychiatric clinic ever since, haven't you?
Yes, but they released me because...
No problem, Rick. Come over and meet a former resident here, Tommy Jarvis. He's got some kinda prank going about...
There's no time for this bullshit...
Why didn't you cremate him?!
They were gonna! But some asshole sent a lot of money to give Jason and his mother a decent burial. Now look, you just lie down and get some rest. In the morning I'll call that clinic and see if they...
If you'd just go to the cemetery, you'll see I'm not lying.
Either you go to sleep or I'll come in there and put you out.
Either you go to sleep or I'll come in there and put you out.
You're gonna be sorry you didn't listen to me.
You're gonna be sorry you didn't listen to me.
You're gonna be sorry if you don't shut the fuck up.
I sympathize with you kids. The best I can do is call the station in Carpenter and have them keep a lookout for them.
I got a bad feeling of what might've happened to them.
Yes!
No!... ... You kids better leave. This boy here is not well and I need to talk to him in private.
I was going to call the clinic and have them collect your ass. But I don't want you around here any longer poisoning my daughter, or anyone else, with your warped mind.
But they have to be warned, Sheriff. Jason will return to the area that's familiar. No matter what you call it, it's still Camp Crystal Lake to him.
I gotta show you Jason's grave.
I've seen it.
I've seen it.
Please, Sheriff. You'll see we dug it up.
Don't concern yourself, Martin. This boy needs treatment. We're taking care of it. Sorry for the disturbance.
Jason's not in his coffin! Hawes is! Dig it up! You gotta dig it up!!
With extreme car, for God's sake. If that kid is with her, there's every good chance he'll do something crazy.
Please don't do anything crazy.
You got me where you want me. There's no reason not...
If I had you where I really wanted you, they'd be pumping your ass full of formaldehyde.
Doesn't that tell you something?!
Yeah...They should've paid their bill.
Mr. Duke, how can you claim that Jason Voorhees is not truly dead?
How many times has Jason been reported killed before, Mr. Campbell?
How many times has Jason been reported killed before, Mr. Campbell?
Eight times.
Eight times.
Eight times. They've burned him, dipped him in nuclear waste --
Eight times. They've burned him, dipped him in nuclear waste --
-- But this time they bombed him and then cremated the body.
-- But this time they bombed him and then cremated the body.
They coulda danced a jig on it an' fed it to goats -- don't matter. Ya' can't kill Jason by gettin' rid of his body. He'll come back the way he always do, to drag the kiddies into the darkness and crush their little skulls -- maybe even your skull, Mr. Campbell.
Well, let's hope not!
Yeah, that'd be a big shame...
In the media, you've frequently been described as "salty" --
-- look, just shut up. Let's cut through the shit. You asked me here because you want me to catch and kill Jason Voorhees for ya'. I'll do it, but it won't be easy...and it won't be cheap. One hundred grand, non- negotiable.
-- look, just shut up. Let's cut through the shit. You asked me here because you want me to catch and kill Jason Voorhees for ya'. I'll do it, but it won't be easy...and it won't be cheap. One hundred grand, non- negotiable.
I understand. However, our audience should be aware that you only charged forty thousand dollars to catch the Idaho skin stretcher.
I understand. However, our audience should be aware that you only charged forty thousand dollars to catch the Idaho skin stretcher.
Skin stretcher was human.
Mr. Duke tonight I'm prepared to offer you your sum of one hundred thousand dollars, payable only after you provide American Casefile with incontrovertible proof of --
-- yeah, yeah, yeah. You just have your hundred grand ready. For that you get the machete...the mask...the whole damn thing.
Diana -- you heard from Jessica lately?
Yes.
...but there just may not be enough time. If you still care about her, if you still want to try to make things better between you two...we should talk.
So let's talk.
So let's talk.
No. Not here. Come by my house tonight at eleven. Don't be late.
You have to...save...Jessica... Save Jessica and save the...
The what?
The what?
Save your...
Steven...
I'm here.
I'm here.
I'm scared. I'm very scared.
Anything else?
Yes.
I know who you are.
I need to talk to you.

Look, I don't want your money!

Then maybe I should offer it to your daughter...
What do you want?
You know what I want. You know why I need you.

You need to leave.
You need to leave.
I know everything about you, Diana.

That's it, we're done.
Everything going okay?

Legs giving you trouble?

Not so bad, today.
Steven buggin' you?
Do you have to ask?
Ed...
Okay. So how is Jessica? You talked to her lately?
Okay. So how is Jessica? You talked to her lately?
Yeah, she's good, considering. That kid just takes everything in stride.
I gotta get back to work.
Okay, I'll call you later.
What's the problem here?
N...nothing.
Hello...
June the 19th.
Jesus!
Sorry, Di. I was just going to my car. I didn't mean to frighten you...
Sorry, Di. I was just going to my car. I didn't mean to frighten you...
It's...It's all right.
Listen...don't you worry about Ed. He'll come around. He's too good a Sheriff to let you give him the slip.
I'm just too old for going steady, Josh.
I'm just too old for going steady, Josh.
So's he and he knows it.
Everything'll work out. Trust me on that.
Okay.
Okay.
Good night, beautiful.

'Night, Josh.
Maybe you should be moving on.
Maybe you should mind your own business.
Maybe you should mind your own business.
Get up!
Get up!
Why don't you blow me, Chief. After your girlfriend gets through.
You're talking about my lady.
She's your lady only cause she ain't had a taste of the Duke yet.
She's your lady only cause she ain't had a taste of the Duke yet.
Goddamnit!
Careful, Chief. I don't think you know who I am.
I know who you are and the last thing we need around here is some freak show "bounty hunter" making trouble. I want you outta town and I want you outta town now!

That's very colorful, chief.
That's very colorful, chief.
Take him to my car. I'll be out in a minute.
Where the fuck is she, Duke?!
That's what I'd like to know.
Why did you want her body?
For a good reason.
For a good reason.
Tell me.
Tell me.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Tell me!
Tell me!
Information like that is very expensive and you don't have the balls to pay the price.
Lock this asshole up.
You think you can lock me up in this piss-ass prison? Hell, this place is motel fuckin' six to me.
Jessica, I'm so sorry. I...I wanted to have this cleaned up before you got here.
That's all right. I was just...
She's beautiful.
Her name's Stephanie.
Her name's Stephanie.
She's yours?
Why didn't you tell me?
I was going to, I was going to tell everyone. I just...didn't expect to be back here so soon. Is Steven around?
Does he know about what happened?
Yeah. Sit down a second. There's something I need to tell you about Steven...
Jesus, Steven, that's...that's really lovely.
I mean, how can you go through life without never having made a prank call?
I mean, how can you go through life without never having made a prank call?
Hell, when Steven was a kid, he was like, having strippers delivered to church Bingos and shit.
It was a community service.
Absolutely. The church even sent me an autographed picture of God. Ward!
What are you doing?
Showing Vicki what she missed out on by being such a dull kid. Now, the first thing you need in making a prank call is, of course, a phone. This one, for instance.

Listen, since I got you on the phone -- ask the guys there if they wanna chip in for a hooker. I'll send her right over. Her name is Vicki.

He was dead. He had to be dead...
How many times do you want to hear this?
Until I hear the truth.
Until I hear the truth.
I've told you the truth.
I've told you the truth.
The truth? That Josh, a man I've trusted with my own life on more than one occasion -- let me see if I've got the order right here -- tried to rape Diana...got the back of his head blown off...took a poker through the gut...fell through a plate glass window and then magically disappeared into the night.

Look, I know I treated her bad --

Oh, you stupid, sorry son-of-a- bitch...
What do you mean you've never made a prank call?
Never.

You mean never as in really never, or never as in it was just so stupid you don't want to tell us about it?

I mean really never.
I mean really never.
I'm sorry to hear that. A famous man once said -- there is no worse regret then a temptation resisted.
That's disgusting.
Disgusting? Bingo night was sold out for six months after that! They raised enough money to build a day care center.
Steven!
She's a waitress at Joey B's but she needs some extra cash. Ward's the pimp.

What's going on? I heard on the P.A. system that...
The Captain's been murdered. The buzz is that Jason might be on board.

Have you seen Tamara?
No. And I'm not losing any sleep over it.

But she might be in trouble...

So what else is new? Look Eva, you're asking the wrong dude to feel sorry for Tamara Mason. Wise up -- it's not hip to be her friend.

I don't care about being hip anymore.
I hear the crew members are cute guys in their twenties.
Really?
Really?
I'm sure we'll have no problem getting them to party with us...especially with this.
It's my graduation gift from Daddy. It cost over a thousand bucks but it's the best.
He bought you that?
He bought you that?
More or less. It's part of my college fund.
A major prick.
What are you going to do?
What are you going to do?
Improvise, of course.
He's undefeated, you know that? Julius is the only senior I'd even consider doing it with. If he wasn't black, that is.
My parents are open minded about that sort of thing.
My parents are open minded about that sort of thing.
My stepmom couldn't care less, but Daddy would have a shit fit. He might even pay some attention to me.
I think it's time for some recreational activity, girl.
Sounds good. I hear there's a shuffleboard court on deck -- it might be kinds cool...

I guess not.
I guess not.
Do you realize how many people would kill to be sitting here right now? Come on, it's grad night. You've got your whole life to be uptight.
A real space cadet. I wonder if she'll narc on us...
I have her in Creative Writing and she's fairly nice.
I have her in Creative Writing and she's fairly nice.
Nobody related to McCulloch can be nice.
What are you going to do?
Relax, I've got McCulloch covered... but that little narcing bitch niece of his is a different matter. Rumor has it she's a teensy bit afraid of the water...
That was truly excellent.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Time to check out the waiters.
Time to check out the waiters.
I think I'll pass. See you later, okay?
I think I'll pass. See you later, okay?
But...wait a minute!
Well...how do you feel?
Ask me in about five minutes.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
What murders?
Never mind, you don't want to know about it.
Never mind, you don't want to know about it.
Tell me.
Tell me.
There's nothing to worry about, Suzy. The guy's dead now, somewhere at the bottom of this lake...if you believe the stories. Let's drop it, okay?
Right.
I mean, Lakeview High just closed its doors for good, right?
I mean, Lakeview High just closed its doors for good, right?
Right.
Right.
So there's no reason for him to come back because there won't be any of us around...right?
Did you hear that?
Hear what?
All right, all right -- I'm a major ass.
And you'll never do it again.
And you'll never do it again.
And I'll never do it again. Forgive me?
And I'll never do it again. Forgive me?
No.
Which cabin is Rennie in, Mr. McCulloch?
Rennie's not coming.
But I thought...
She changed her mind. Let's see...Mr. Wolfe is in stateroom one-eleven and you, Mr. Robertson, are in two-twenty-five.
Where's the radio?
It's...dead.
Christ...where's Rennie??
She's...she's dropping the anchors. I thought the Coast Guard could find us easier if...
She's...she's dropping the anchors. I thought the Coast Guard could find us easier if...
What?? You sent her out there with a murderer running around loose??
What's that?
The fire alarm...
She never should've set foot on this ship. This is your fault!
This is Jason's fault!
This is Jason's fault!
Not another word, do you hear me??
Dear Christ...
We have to get off this ship!!
Jason's here in New York.
Don't be ridiculous!
All right. But if it mysteriously disappears en route, I'll have you sent back home the minute we dock. Understood?
Perfectly.
What are you doing in here?
Nothing.
I'11 be coming around your stateroom in exactly fifteen minutes, Miss Mason. You'd better have your biology project ready or I'm phoning your parents.
They're out of town.
They're out of town.
Then I'll make sure you remain on board while your classmates see the sights.
Where did you get that alcohol?
I packed it. Just for us.
That's it. You're not setting foot off this ship until we return home.
But I haven't even shown you my biology project...
Hello, Charles. Has everyone checked in?
Jim Miller and Suzy Donaldson never showed up. I'm a little concerned.
Jim Miller and Suzy Donaldson never showed up. I'm a little concerned.
Don't be. They probably decided to explore each other rather than New York.
Let's go -- we're running two minutes late.
Charles, there's someone else coming along too.
You have no right...
And neither do you. It's up to Rennie to decide what she wants to do.

I'm her legal guardian, not you or anybody else, and I alone know what's best for her. End of discussion.
I'm her legal guardian, not you or anybody else, and I alone know what's best for her. End of discussion.
No, I think it's just the beginning.
She's fine, Charles. Take it easy...
Oh, I can see that. You've done a wonderful job of supervising the kids, Miss Van Deusen.
I thought I told you to stay away from her.
Where is she?
I demand to know what is going on...
Oh dear God...
What are you doing??
That lunatic has been spouting off about Jason since we boarded... It's no coincidence.

But that doesn't prove that he's the one!
But that doesn't prove that he's the one!
Walking corpses are not real!
Did you find Rennie?
She's locked safe in her room, no thanks to either of you. Has he brought it back on course yet?
He's doing the best he can, Charles.
He's the son of the Captain, for Chrissakes. You'd think he'd be able to operate this thing!
I doubt very much that one even exists.
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
Use some common sense! Setting off a fire alarm causes panic...the same kind of panic caused by suggesting Jason Voorhees is on board. Enough is enough.
What did you do with Rennie??
Nothing! I went to her cabin and...
There must be a phone around here somewhere.
A wonderful choice of places to dock a boat, Mr. Robertson.
Everyone split up -- we'll cover more ground that way.
I don't think that's such a safe idea
I don't think that's such a safe idea
My niece's life hangs in the balance right now!! Every second counts.
What a beautiful day.
Perfect for a swim, isn't it?
You've been coming out here every summer for the last three years, young lady, and you still haven't learned how.
I'll take some lessons this time. I promise.
He never learned how either and he's still at the bottom of this lake.
He is not.
He is not.
Oh, he is indeed. And ready to pull down anybody who falls in and can't swim.
Oh, he is indeed. And ready to pull down anybody who falls in and can't swim.
You're telling a lie.
You're telling a lie.
Am I? Let's find out.
I...I can't...
You can and you will! Swim, Rennie!
You're making a big mistake, Rennie. It's not too late to put you back on land.
I'm staying.
I'm staying.
If Miss Van Deusen knew how afraid you were of...

Why are you doing this to yourself?

I don't even know why I'm afraid, Uncle Charles. I can't even remember when it started. Don't you think it's time I found out and got over it?
Facing your fear doesn't always conquer it.
I'm staying.
You had me worried to death!
But Sean said...
But Sean said...
I'm the one you should be listening to! Do you think dropping an anchor in the middle of a storm makes any sense whatsoever?
Can't we at least talk about it?
I refuse to discuss this ridiculous notion that a ghoul is terrorizing this ship.
I refuse to discuss this ridiculous notion that a ghoul is terrorizing this ship.
But what about the drowning boy I've been seeing?
Whatever you've been...imagining... has nothing to do with Jason Voorhees. I want you to be safe, Rennie. That's all I care about.
I'm not staying in my room, Uncle Charles.
I'm not staying in my room, Uncle Charles.
This isn't a request.
Get in the boat, Rennie!
I...I can't...
I...I can't...
You can and you will!!
You pushed me...
I was only trying to teach you. But I pulled you out, Rennie. I saved your life.
I'm glad you decided to come after all.
Me too. But I'm not sure Uncle Charles will be.
Me too. But I'm not sure Uncle Charles will be.
You let me worry about him, okay? Personal experiences are what fuel the minds of great writers, Rennie. You made the right decision.

What about not-so-great writers?
Everything okay?
Just felt a little chill.
Did you know that I'm giving up teaching?
Really?
Really?
Since the school is closing anyway, I'm going to write that novel I've been threatening on everybody.
Since the school is closing anyway, I'm going to write that novel I've been threatening on everybody.
That's wonderful, Miss Van Deusen...what's it about?
Stephen King supposedly used it when he was in high school.
I don't know what to say...
I don't know what to say...
Rennie, you're the best student I ever had...you have a real gift. If anybody can make use of that pen, it's you.
Rennie -- I was just on my way over to your room
Have you seen my dog anywhere?
Have you seen my dog anywhere?
No, but I'm sure Toby's fine. The ship's only so big and there's certainly no way off it, is there?
So, are you having fun yet?
Yeah...a lot.
Yeah...a lot.
I seem to detect a hint of ingenuousness in your tone. In other words, level with me.

There's something I haven't told you...
I can't swim.
I gathered that.
I had a skiing accident in high school, broke my left leg. It took three winters before I would even look at the snow again...but the solution kept eluding me. I finally took lessons. I've never broken a bone since.
It's not that simple.

Whenever I get near the water, I see this young boy drowning. He tries to pull me down with him.
When did this start?
About four years ago...at Crystal Lake. I spent a few summers there with Uncle Charles inbetween boarding school.

After your parents passed away?
Did you have an accident in the lake?
No. It was just a normal summer. I've never been able to figure it out.
No. It was just a normal summer. I've never been able to figure it out.
Only one young boy ever drowned in that lake, and that was before you were even born. His name was Jason Voorhees.
The Captain and Chief Engineer... they've been...they're dead.

Rennie...
Hi, Sean.
Hi, Sean.
I heard you weren't coming.

We changed our minds.
I got you a present.
But I didn't get you one...
But I didn't get you one...
Forget it. It's a dumb little thing anyway.
I thought maybe we could hike to the top of the Statue when we got there, if you felt like it. It's supposed to be 22 stories tall.
I'd love to.
It's okay...you're going to be okay.
I want to go home. I want off this ship.
Can he really take us home?
Not completing a voyage is against everything he stands for. But I think I can convince him to call a Coast Guard cutter for you.

What about you?
What about you?
If I go with you, he'll never speak to me again. But I'm never going to live up to his expectations anyway...so maybe it's the right thing to do.
I don't know...we've gone off course or something...
What do you mean???
I think so. But we have to lower the anchors so we don't drift any further...
Where are they?
Where are they?
The bow...front of the ship. There's a hoist on each side that lowers them
I didn't mean for you to go!
Just radio for help, okay???
Rennie...??
The window...
Rule one, don't panic. Rule two, assess the damage and act accordingly...
Is the ship going to sink??
We'll be okay. I want you to wait by the lifeboats, just in case.
I'm not going near any lifeboat!
I'm not going near any lifeboat!
But Rennie...

I'm not!!
Rennie...what'd they do to you??
Drugs... Then Jason came. He's here, Sean.
You have to call the police...
Please, hurry...

It was rummy, not poker. But I'll take a chance and let you in.
It's a constant shock to me, how small this place is. How did we do it? Five people in these little rooms.

The Red Sox are your problem. I never understood about you and the Red Sox. Everybody rooted for the Yankees.
Remember 1949? Last two games of the season. Against the Yankees. The Sox lost on Saturday. Then they lost on Sunday. First I cried for twenty-four hours. Then I had fist- fights the rest of the week.

It's complicated. It's a whole life. A person doesn't commit an act of violence out of nowhere. There are strong forces at work.
You're a family man, Frankie?

This is something no one has been privileged to see in almost seventy years. Very few people now alive can say that they have seen what you are about to see, Matthew. The Red Sox win a World Series.

They're my team, too. I grew up on Boyleston Street. Right by Fenway Park. I went to fifty or sixty games a year. All by myself. I was one of those kids with scabby elbows. I called out to the players. `Look over here. Hi, I'm Steven. My parents are divorced.'
I went to college in Boston so I could be near the Red Sox. I took summer classes and the cut them to go to the game. My wife is from Boston. Lillian Ziegler?

Because I can't bear to watch. When they lose, I die inside. It's like some little person named Steve just crumples up and dies. I wait for the scores. I still die, hearing the scores, but it's over in a second. I can't survive the game pitch by pitch, inning by inning. I've done it too many times. And I can't do it anymore.
I was six years old the day Pesky hesitated throwing home and Slaughter scored all the way from first. That's when I knew the Red Sox were my team. Pity and terror.
When I traveled through Asia this summer, I went to tremendous trouble and expense to rent a car with a phone so I could call up Sports Phone in New York and get the scores. I drove through the war in Afghanistan calling Sports Phone like every hour on the hour, for updates.

In other words I never understood until today how much pain and anxiety you've been causing with your reviews. Steven, it's so unfair.
Of course it's unfair. The truth is always unfair. Why do you think I live this way? Hiding out. Stealing electricity from a lamp post. Because people who write the truth are outcasts of society. I can't live openly, in a nice clean doorman building, with my name on the mailbox. They'd come after me in packs.

Here, you see? Even the South African papers apologize -- "a monstrous attack."
Are you sure?
Are you sure?
Yes -- I can't talk like this.
Oww!
Mr. Khan said they called you brave.
Sora was sent to tell me I -- I must rake and cover the latrine.
Everyone takes his turn.
Everyone takes his turn.
It is the work of untouchables.

In this place there are no untouchables -- and no work is beneath any of us!

I am your wife.
I am your wife.
All the more reason.
Please! You're being foolish!
There's no room! And the air is lovely.
God gave you ten thumbs.
Eleven.
"Take a fifth step, that we may serve the people."
"I will follow close behind you and help to serve the people."
"Take a sixth step, that we may follow our vows in life."
"I will follow you in all our vows and duties."
No -- prison is rather agreeable to me, and there is no doubt that after the war, independence will come. My only worry is what shape it will take. Jinnah has --
Stop!
"...what shape it will take." Jinnah has -- what?
Jinnah has -- has cooperated with the British. It has given him power and the freedom to speak, and he has filled the Muslims with fears of what will happen to them in a country that is predominantly Hindu. That I find hard to bear -- even in prison.
But do you really believe you could use non-violence against someone like Hitler?
Not without defeats -- and great pain. But are there no defeats in this war -- no pain? What you cannot do is accept injustice. From Hitler -- or anyone. You must make the injustice visible -- be prepared to die like a soldier to do so.
Is my finger supposed to be wrapped around that?
No. That is what you get for distracting me.
No. That is what you get for distracting me.
What do you expect when you talk like that?
What do you expect when you talk like that?
I expect you to show as much patience as I am now.
You really are going to Pakistan, then? You are a stubborn man.
I'm simply going to prove to Muslims there, and Hindus here, that the only devils in the world are those running around in our own hearts -- and that's where all our battles ought to be fought.
Enough.
One more.
Just an admirer...
Nothing's more dangerous, especially for an old man.
You'd be Gandhi -- ...I thought you'd be bigger.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I -- I mean it's all right. It doesn't matter. I'm -- my name is Andrews, Charlie Andrews. I've come from India -- I've read a great deal about you.
I -- I mean it's all right. It doesn't matter. I'm -- my name is Andrews, Charlie Andrews. I've come from India -- I've read a great deal about you.
Some of it good, I hope.
You're a clergyman.
Yes. I've -- I've met some very remarkable people in India... and -- and when I read what you've been doing here, I -- I wanted to help. Does that surprise you?
Yes. I've -- I've met some very remarkable people in India... and -- and when I read what you've been doing here, I -- I wanted to help. Does that surprise you?
Not anymore. At first I was amazed... but when you are fighting in a just cause, people seem to pop up -- like you -- right out of the pavement. Even when it is dangerous or --
That was lucky.
I thought you were a man of God.
I thought you were a man of God.
I am. But I'm not so egotistical as to think He plans His day around my dilemmas.
That's the sort of thing you'll be seeking on this "farm"...
Well, we shall try.
No violence, please.
Let me hang on with two hands or I will fall.
What are you doing?
Going nearer to God!
Not quite. They're only "holding me" until the Magistrate's hearing. Then it will be prison.
Did they take your clothes?
If I want to be one with them, I have to live like them.
I think you do. But I thank God we all don't.
I'm sure your legs are quite as handsome as mine.
Ah, but my puritanism runs the another way. I'm far too modest for such a display.
They're calling you "Bapu." I thought it meant father.
It does. We must be getting old, Charlie.
...and I knew something had to give. And I was determined to be here when it did.
How does a reporter in Central America learn that Gandhi was born in Porbandar anyway?

Oh, I've been a Gandhi buff for a long time.
You mean Gandhi?
Back in South Africa... long time ago.

What was he like?
What was he like?
Lots of hair... and a little like a college freshman -- trying to figure everything out.
Lots of hair... and a little like a college freshman -- trying to figure everything out.
Well, he must've found some of the answers...
What'd he say?
He said he's in charge...
Tell me -- do you think about hell?
"Hell!"
"Hell!"
No -- neither do I. But... but this man is a Christian and he has written --
Excuse me, baas, but how long have you been in South Africa?
A -- a week.
A -- a week.
Well, I don't know how you got a ticket for --
I'll take your luggage back, baas.
No, no -- just a moment, please.
We only make wild speeches, or perform even wilder acts of terrorism. We've bred an army of anarchists but not one single group that can really fight the British anywhere.
I thought you were against fighting.
Fortunately such news comes very slowly where I live.
I think if we all worked to publicize it... all of the Congress... every avenue we know.
Maybe I'm wrong... maybe we're not ready yet. In South Africa the numbers were small...
The Government's afraid, and they don't know what to do. But they're more afraid of terrorists than of you. The Viceroy has agreed to your release if you will speak for non- violence.
The Government's afraid, and they don't know what to do. But they're more afraid of terrorists than of you. The Viceroy has agreed to your release if you will speak for non- violence.
I've never spoken for anything else.
What can we do?
We must end the campaign.
If we obtain our freedom by murder and bloodshed I want no part of it.
It was one incident.
It was one incident.
Tell that to the families of the policemen who died.
I don't believe it -- even the British can't be that stupid!
Panditji -- please, help me.
And Jinnah?
He's waiting. He's not prepared to accept it will mean as much as you think.
He's waiting. He's not prepared to accept it will mean as much as you think.
Wait and see... wait and see...
They are only clinging to old dreams and trying to split us in the old way. But the will has gone -- Independence will drop like a ripe apple. The only question is when and how.
I say when is now -- and we will determine how.
What do you want?
That the fighting will stop -- that you make me believe it will never start again.
Without a paper -- a journal of some kind -- you cannot unite a community. You belong to a very important profession.
Hm. And what should an "important professional" write about your response to General Smuts's new legislation?
Hm. And what should an "important professional" write about your response to General Smuts's new legislation?
I don't know... I'm still searching for a "response."
I don't know... I'm still searching for a "response."
You will respect the law.
You will respect the law.
There are unjust laws -- as there are unjust men.
Well, it's quite a place, your "ashram" -- is that right?
That's right. The word only means "community." But it could stand for "village"... or the world.
You're an ambitious man.
I hope not.
It's beautiful.
Even as a boy I thought so.
And you've come all this way because you think something is going to happen?
Hm. Is it?
Hm. Is it?
Perhaps. I've come here to think about it.
Do you remember much of South Africa?
A great deal.
A great deal.
I've traveled so far -- and thought so much. As you can see, my city was a sea city -- always filled with Hindus and Muslims and Sikhs and Jews and Persians. The temple where you were yesterday is of my family's sect, the Pranami. It was Hindu of course but the priests used to read from the Muslim Koran and the Hindu Gita,
You've done me a great service.
It would have been uncivil of me to have let you make such a long trip for nothing.
Is it over if they arrest you now?
Not if they arrest me -- or a thousand -- or ten thousand. It is not only generals who know how to plan campaigns.
Are you going to walk all the way?
My name is Walk-er. And I intend to report it the way it is.
It has. But you'd be surprised. They understand -- they really do. It's not the workers you have to worry about.
Good. Ba will have to teach you to spin too.
Good. Ba will have to teach you to spin too.
I would rather march.
I would rather march.
First spin. Let the others march for a time.
Do you find me stubborn?
I don't know... I know you are right. I don't know that this is right.
I'm sure I'm fit for at least five hundred miles.
You should ride the pony. It is not necessary to walk to prove the point.
It is foolish if it is just to save the life of an old man.
No... no. In every temple and mosque they have pledged to die before they lift a hand against each other.
We hope you intend to join us in the struggle for Home Rule, Mr. Gandhi.
I --
The honor is ours. May I introduce Mr. Kallenbach. He's an old friend and his interest is in flowers. I presumed to tell him he could wander your gardens while we talked.
I'll send my gardener. I'm sure you'll have much to discuss.
You mean a general strike?
I mean a day of prayer and fasting. But of course no work could be done -- no buses, no trains, no factories, no administration. The country would stop.
After what they did at the massacre -- it's only an eye for an eye.
An eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind. We must stop.
I will not sit by to see the mastery of the British replaced by the mastery of the Hindus!
Muslim and Hindu are the right and left eye of India. No one will be slave, no one master.
Who is that young man?
That's young Nehru. He's got his father's intellect, his mother's looks and the devil's charm. If they don't ruin him at Cambridge -- Wave! Wave! -- he may amount to something.
I must say when I first saw you as a bumbling lawyer here in Bombay I never thought I'd be greeting you as a national hero.
I'm hardly that, Mr. Patel.
I'm hardly that, Mr. Patel.
Oh, yes, you are. It's been two hundred years since an Indian has cocked a snoot at the British Empire and got away with it. And stop calling me Mr. Patel, you're not a junior clerk anymore.
Oh, yes, you are. It's been two hundred years since an Indian has cocked a snoot at the British Empire and got away with it. And stop calling me Mr. Patel, you're not a junior clerk anymore.
No.
I am beginning to know Mr. Nehru.
Well, I've called you here because I've had a chance to see the new legislation. It's exactly what was rumored. Arrest without warrant. Automatic imprisonment for possession of materials considered seditious...
It must have been the only Non-violent campaign ever led by a man who wanted to kill everybody every day.
Not true! The secret is mastering the urge.
They are preparing for war. I will not support it, but I do not intend to take advantage of their danger.
That's when you take advantage.
We need your help!
There is nothing I can give.
In England, I was a poor student but I --
That was England.
You mean you employ Mr. Baker as your attorney, but you can't walk down the street with him?
I can. But I risk being kicked into the gutter by someone less "holy" than Mr. Baker.
Well, then, it must be fought. We are children of God like everyone else.
Allah be praised. And what battalions will you call upon?
Allah be praised. And what battalions will you call upon?
I -- I will write to the press -- here -- and in England. And I will use the courts.
They're sparing no one, I see.
No. You were the surprise. It's been all over the prison. We thought they'd be too afraid of the English press.
No. You were the surprise. It's been all over the prison. We thought they'd be too afraid of the English press.
So did I.
I don't know who they've left out there to do the work. There can't be one mine left open. Have they touched the women?
My wife publicly defied the law. They've arrested her and four others.

The fools! Sorry...
The fools! Sorry...
It's split the Government.
It's split the Government.
Well, that's one victory.
If we hold firm, it won't be the last.
Don't worry -- I've never seen men so determined. You've given them a way to fight... And I don't think --
Will you have a glass of sherry?
Thank you. No.
Perhaps some tea?
I dined at the prison.
I dined at the prison.
Ahh.
Mr. Gandhi, I've more or less decided to ask the House to repeal the Act that you have taken such "exception" to.
Well, if you ask, General Smuts, I'm sure it will be done.
Hm. Of course it is not quite that simple.
Somehow I expected not.
I'm glad to hear you say that... very glad. You see if we repeal the Act under pressure under this kind of pressure it will create a great deal of resentment. Can you understand that?
Very well.
Good. Good. I have thought of calling for a Royal Commission to "investigate" the new legislation. I think I could guarantee they would recommend the Act be repealed.
I congratulate them.
You're an extraordinary man.
I assure you I feel a very ordinary man at this moment.
Assuming we are in agreement?
Yes -- yes. It's just that... in these clothes I'd -- I'd prefer to go by taxi.
Yes -- yes. It's just that... in these clothes I'd -- I'd prefer to go by taxi.
All right. Fine.
All right. Fine.
I'm -- I'm afraid I have no money.
I'm -- I'm afraid I have no money.
Oh! Neither have I. I'm awfully sorry.
And that's the basis of this "Declaration of Independence"?
Yes, sir. The day he sets off everyone is supposed to raise the flag of "Free India." Then he walks some two hundred and forty miles to the sea and makes salt.
...There's been no time to keep figures, but there must be ninety -- a hundred thousand under arrest. And it still goes on.
Who's leading them?
Who's leading them?
I don't know! Nehru, Patel, almost every Congress Official is in jail... and their wives and their children -- we've even arrested Nehru's mother.
He's addressed this letter directly to you, has he?
Yes, sir, he has. The usual -- India's salt belongs to India -- but then he says flatly that he personally is going to lead a raid tomorrow on the Dharasana Salt Works.
Yes, sir, he has. The usual -- India's salt belongs to India -- but then he says flatly that he personally is going to lead a raid tomorrow on the Dharasana Salt Works.
Thank him for his letter, and put him in jail.
Ah -- we should invite Gandhi. What the devil has happened to him anyway?
He's "discovering" India.
Have you read his magazine?
No -- but I think I'm going to.
Bapu, for me, and the rest, if that is what you want, we will accept it. But out there already there is rioting because Hindus fear you are going to give too much away.
If you did this, no one could control it. No one.
He was right. It's insane -- anything would have been better.
Have you found him?
In Calcutta it's like civil war. The Muslims rose and there was a bloodbath, and now the Hindus are taking revenge -- and if we can't stop it there'll be no hope for the Hindus left in Pakistan.
...an eye for an eye making the whole world blind.
Could we cut all news off? I know --
Bapu -- please. Where are you going.
You almost sound like you believe that.
Come with me now, Vincent. You've gone as far as you can go.

I will prove it to you. Come swim with me now, Vincent. Now--tonight.
How are you doing this, Vincent? How have you done <i>any</i> of this?
Now is your chance to find out.
Vincent, where's the shore? We're too far out. We have to go back!
Too late for that. We're closer to the other side.
We were wondering if we should leave some things to chance.
You want to give your child the best possible start. Believe me, we have enough imperfection built-in already. Your child doesn't need any additional burdens. And keep in mind, this child is still you, simply the <i>best</i> of you. You could conceive naturally a thousand times and never get such a result.

He's right, Maria. That's right.
Is there any reason you'd want a left-handed child?
Er, no...
Er, no...

I have to warn you, Mr Luca, he's going to be at least a head taller than you. Prepare for a crick in the neck in sixteen years time.
How much extra?
It would be five thousand more.
I'm sorry, there's no way we can.
Don't worry. You'll probably do just as well singing to him in the womb. We can implant the most successful pre-embryo tomorrow afternoon.
So you've finally seen sense and come back to your old job, Vincent.
Not yet, I'm afraid.
Not yet, I'm afraid.
No? What's keeping you?
No? What's keeping you?
I guess I'm a slow learner.

By the way, I left some trash in your locker.

With respect, Sir--it may be the only unaccountable specimen but the profile suggests--
--What <i>about</i> his profile?
According to this, he's a sick man. Congenital heart condition. Who knows how long the specimen has been here but there's an 80 percent chance the owner of that eyelash has already died himself from natural causes.
So there's a 20 percent chance he's <i>not</i> dead.
Even if this Vincent Luca <i>is</i> alive, is it likely he could bludgeon a man to death?
No. Not <i>likely</i>.
Of course that doesn't jibe with what we found. This was an angry killing.
Who knows with these "deficients"? His profile indicates a proclivity for violence.

Detective Hugo, it's a simple case of lost and found. All we have to do is locate the man who's minus an eyelash and this murder will solve itself.
We're in the wrong place. We're wasting time.
This <i>is</i> the most likely location--
--There's that word again. I have a feeling This man doesn't play the odds, Detective. Not exactly a slave to probability. Is it "likely" that a man who has successfully eluded authorities for fifteen years--a brutal killer--is going to come to us now like a lamb?
Is there something more we should know about this suspect, Sir? I mean besides what's on his sheet.

The skin flake was found in Michael's Restaurant. The employees are all accounted for.
A customer? Does this Michael's cater to misfits?
A customer? Does this Michael's cater to misfits?
No. But one or two "borrowed ladders" have shown up there in the past.
Of course. He's a "de-gene-erate". He works at Gattaca. Why else would we find the eyelash near the washroom? Nobody stops to take a leak during a murder.
It's still possible the eyelash specimen came from a janitor, delivery man--it could have blown in through an open window.
He was afraid of being exposed. That's why he did it.
It is hard to believe he could be one of their elite workers. You've seen their security system. They know who works there. Even if you ignore the man's expiration date, his profile suggests that he doesn't have the mathematical propensity let alone the stamina to pass their physicals.

We'll vacuum these streets if we have to.
Positive saliva match. The cup was definitely used since the original sweep.
So we have two choices. Either our suspect came back to the murder scene for a drink of water and I don't know anybody that thirsty or... ...he <i>is</i> here. We test again. You're right, Hugo, this was a desperate act. Someone had a lot to lose that night--perhaps their place in line. I'd like the profiles of everyone with an upcoming mission.
We found his spit in the dead director's eye. He's signed a confession--supplied us with the suit he wore on the night. What more do you want?
Luca could still be an accomplice.
It's not <i>exactly</i> him.
Where did you get this?
How often do you test, Director?
Often.
Often.
Surely you know what you have.
Surely you know what you have.
We have to be certain. Once they're up, we can hardly turn the boat around.
We believe we have a suspect.
What a relief.
What a relief.
This unaccountable specimen was found in the south wing corridor.

No, but since there aren't too many <i>live</i> ones tonight either, you won't mind us conducting one further sweep. If he does not work here, then there should be no other trace of him. I think you'd better get some people out of bed, Detective. In the meantime we can re-check his favorite haunt.
Twelve have a mission within the week.
This time I will supervise each test personally.
At least it's nothing contagious.
I will not permit any further testing on the eve of a mission. We're already counting backwards.

That's where we get rid of the traces of him although we never truly succeeded.
I've been looking for him. Do you know where he is?
I've been looking for him. Do you know where he is?
He's probably leaving some more of me around the place before he goes.
Don't be deceived, Irene. These are just the clothes. He has to wear them. Something I could never do.
What's wrong with him?

You have more in common than you know.
Okay, how tall did you <i>used</i> to be?
Six one.

He's too tall.

If anybody asks, tell them the truth-- your family disowns you. You are a disappointment, Jerome.

God, what <i>wouldn't</i> you do to leave the planet?
God, what <i>wouldn't</i> you do to leave the planet?
Leave? Just a few million years ago every atom in this hair--in our bodies--was a part of a star. I don't see it as leaving. I see it as going home.

God, you're serious, aren't you?
It's not too late to back out.
You don't know what a relief it is not to be me. Are you sure <i>you</i> want the job?
What about you? What's in this for you, Eugene?
Listen, I bag this stuff anyway. It may as well pay my rent.
Who died?
The Mission Director.
The Mission Director.
You wish.

They found him in his office this morning-- beaten so bad they had to check his nametag.
What an act of benevolence--a service to the community. So that's it. Now there's nothing between you and ignition.
He was still warm when they confirmed.

Hey, how much of you can be there? Even if the "J. Edgars" do find something, in a week-- you'll be slightly out of their jurisdiction. Come on, we've got to get drunk immediately.

You're going to have to earn your supper. I've got my final physical tomorrow.
Let's get out of here.
You're right, there's more atmosphere where you're going.
I gotta stop!! I gotta stop!!
Keep going!! Keep going!!
At least up there your piss will be worth something. You'll all be showering in it, right?
And drinking it. It's like Evian by the time it's filtered.

How long do you stay up there before you go?

A day or so.
A day or so.
I still can't believe they're sending you to the Belt--you of all people--never meant to be born, on a mission to discover the origin of life.
Up there they wouldn't be a problem.
You know I'm scared of heights.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It's okay, Eugene.

You know I wasn't drunk--I knew what I was doing when I walked in front of that car--

What makes them think that?
They found my eyelash.

Where is your head, Jerome? You're acting like a guilty man. They won't marry the eyelash to you. They won't believe that one of their elite navigators could have suckered them for the last five years.

How could they recognize you? <i>I</i> don't recognize you. Anyway, you don't have a choice. You run, you may as well sign a confession, turn us both in right now. No, we stick this out-- find out what we can but change nothing. This is a minor inconvenience is all it is. We've taken worse heat than this. Jesus, if I'd known you were
And keep your lashes on your lids where they belong. How could you be so careless?
I'm sorry. I think I was crying.
You really had other offers?
I'm sure I could have.
So it's not just the Hoovers who've got you rattled.
You're the one who said not to change anything. She's my ear to the investigation.

How was your evening?
Complicated. I couldn't stop her apologizing.

I'm travelling too.
Thank you.
I got the better end of the deal. I just lent you my body--you lent me your dream.
First, we may as well decide on gender. Have you given it any thought?
We would like Vincent to have a brother... you know, to play with.
You've already specified blue eyes, dark hair and fair skin. I have taken the liberty of eradicating any potentially prejudicial conditions - premature baldness, myopia, alcoholism and addictive susceptibility, propensity for violence and obesity--
--We didn't want--<i>diseases</i>, yes.
Anything I've forgotten?
We want him--we were hoping he would get married and have children. We'd like grandchildren.

I understand. That's already been taken care of. Now you appreciate I can only work with the raw material I have at my disposal but for a little extra...I could also attempt to insert sequences associated with enhanced mathematical or musical ability.

I have to caution you it's not fool-proof. With multi-gene traits there can be no guarantees.
What will happen to the others?
They are not babies, Maria, merely "human possibilities".
What do you think?
I think I could do something provided you know what you're doing and you can meet the terms.
Vincent...Vincent...
German, is that you?
German, is that you?
Vincent, come down. I've found him.
He has the heart of an ox. He could run through a Goddamn wall--if he could still run. Actually, he was a big college swimming star.
I hope he's not just a body.

It happened in Australasia. He checked in yesterday. No family complications, no record he ever broke his neck. As far as anybody's concerned, he's still a walking, talking, fully-productive member of society. You just have to get him off the pipe and fill in the last two years of his life. Excuse me, <i>your</i> life.

That's the hair color in his profile?
Yeah.
I'd have to bleach my hair.

They said the same thing about myopia and obesity. You think your children would be less human if they were less violent, angry, spiteful? Maybe they'd be <i>more</i> human. From where I sit the world could stand a little improving.
Hugo! I've found him!
I've found him too.
I've found him too.
A fingerprint. There's something to be said for nostalgia. What did you find?
No bother.
I've been asked to compile a log for the investigators--they want to know everyone's whereabouts last night.
I've been asked to compile a log for the investigators--they want to know everyone's whereabouts last night.
Last night? I was at home.
Can that be, er, verified? Were you alone?
No it can't be verified. Yes I was alone.
Looks bad, doesn't it, Irene? What about <i>you?</i> Where were you last night?
I was at home.

We were just looking.

Perhaps we ought to celebrate, Irene.
You celebrate, Jerome?
You didn't know?
Yes...<i>yes</i>...
Yes...<i>yes</i>...
You're angry--
You're angry--
Why would I be angry? It was beautiful.
I envy you, Jerome.
You'll be next.
You'll be next.
I don't think so. The only trip I'll make in space is around the sun-- --on this satellite right here.
It's here. My heart. I'm careful--weekly check-ups. I'm on a drug maintenance program, blood thinners, diet-- I just want you to know what you'd be getting yourself into.
What exactly is wrong?
What exactly is wrong?
Nothing yet. I'll start experiencing symptoms in my late-fifties. But unless they come up with something between now and then, I won't live much past 67.
Of course I think about it every day.
Of course.
So you didn't do it after all.
I guess somebody beat me to it.
What <i>is</i> this place?
You've never been here? Let me order for you.
Why are we leaving?
Those checks take forever.
What about the car?
Let's walk.
Let's walk.

We'll get it later. Irene, please.

So you're not so smart after all. I want you to know--if it ever came to it-- I'd be willing to get an ovum from the Egg Bank. In fact, I'd <i>rather</i> use a donor egg-- --<i>if</i> it came to it.

What is it?
I forgot something--something at home. I'll see you later.
--when you go away.
We could go together one day.
A year is a long time.
Not so long--just once around the sun.
Jerome...never shy. Pisses on command. You've got a beautiful cock. I ever told you that, Jerome?
Only every time I'm in here.
If everything goes to plan, this could be the last time I see you for a while. One week to go. Please tell me you're the least bit excited.
I'll tell you at the end of the week.
I've got enough here.
Need any more, you can always get it off his shoes.
What's this, Lamar?
New policy.
Flight got you nervous?
There's a problem, Lamar.
There's a problem, Lamar.
Did I ever tell you about my son, Jerome? He's a big fan of yours. He wants to apply here.
Just remember, Lamar, I could have gone up and back and nobody would have been the wiser--
--Unfortunately my son's not all that they promised. But then, who know what he could do.
What are you doing?
I can't do this.

Rick...
One moment, I'll be right with you. In fact, a...one point, which I spoke to you of which I can't talk to you about here.
I've wanted to talk to you for some time. For a long time, actually. I said, "The Machine, there's a man I would work with. There's a man..." You know? I never said a thing. I should have, don't know why I didn't. And that shit you were slinging on my guy today was so good...it...it was, and, excuse me, 'cause it isn't even

When you die you're going to regret the things you don't do. You think you're queer...? I'm going to tell you something: we're all queer. You think that you're
Did I...?
Did I...?
Yes.
Yes.
I don't know.
Or a piss...? A great meal fades in reflection. Everything else gains. You know why? 'Cause it's only food. This shit we eat, it keeps us going. But it's only food. The great fucks that you may have had. What do you remember about them?
What do I...?
What do I...?
Yes.
Yes.
Mmmm...

I don't know. For me, I'm saying, what is is, it's probably not the orgasm. Some broads, forearms on your neck, something her eyes did. There was a sound she made...or, me, lying, in the, I'll tell you: me lying in bed; the next day she brought me café au lait. She gives me a cigarette, my balls feel like concrete. Eh? What I'm
Money? If that's what it signifies to you. Security? Comfort? All it is is THINGS THAT HAPPEN TO YOU. That's all it is. How are they different? Some poor newly married guy gets run down by a cab.

My wife...
My wife said I have to cancel the deal.
It's a common reaction, Jim. I'll tell you what it is, and I know that that's why you married her. One of the reasons is prudence. It's a sizable investment. One thinks twice...it's also something women have. It's just a reaction to the size of the investment. Monday, if you'd invite me for dinner again... This woman can cook...

I know. I know, Michael. It's Christmas, your brothers and sister are all here -- we are happy. Let's not spoil this. Go your own way, but when you are ready, come to me the way a son should. I have hopes for you...
Don Francesco. You murdered my husband, because he would not bend. And his oldest son Paolo, because he swore revenge. But Vitone is only nine, and dumb-witted. He never speaks.
I'm not afraid of his words.

He will be a man, and then he will come for revenge.
Otherwise the police will come to see you and your wife and children will be dishonored and destitute. Of course, if my information as to your gains is incorrect, I'll dip my beak just a little. Just a little, but no less than one hundred dollars, and don't try to deceive me, eh paisan?
My two friends have my share of the money. I'll have to speak to them after we deliver these to the wholesaler.

You tell your friends I expect them to let me wet my beak in the same manner. Don't be afraid to tell them. Clemenza and I know each other well, he understands these things. Let yourself be guided by him. He has more experience in these matters.

I'm a little short. I've been out of work. Let me owe you the money for a few weeks.

Ah, you're a sharp young fellow. How is it I've never noticed you before You're too quiet for your own interest. I could find some work for you to do that would be very profitable. No hard feelings, eh? If I can ever do you a service let me know. You've done a good job for yourself tonight.
Ten to one shot, you said. Ten to one shot in my favor, and I lose.
Get a good night's sleep. We got a new suit, new shirt, new tie, and I'm going to shave you myself. Tomorrow we want you to look respectable for fifty million of your fellow Americans.

Yeah, some deal I made.
Why'd you do it, Frankie? After all these years, why'd you turn against him?
I didn't turn against nobody; he turned against me.
Ready, Frankie.
Let's go.
Who's that? Pentangeli? Frankie &quot;Five-Angels&quot;...thought you were never coming West.
Gotta check up on my boys. Hey, what's with the food? Some kid in a white jacket brings me a ritz cracker with some chopped liver. 'Canapes,' he says. I say, 'Can a peas, my ass, that's a ritz cracker with chopped liver.' Go get me a salami sandwich and a glass of wine or I'll send you and your white jacket to the

Me and you, great! Gimme an hour to wash my face and do my research and we'll have these Washington suckers right where you want 'em. Poor Frankie Five-Angels. He always wanted to die in bed...with a broad.
Jeeze, it's great you came along, Mike... You know, we've never spent a night out on the town together. I always thought you looked down on me for liking a good time.
I never looked down on you, Fredo. You don't look down at a brother.
Mike, I got something special up my sleeve for these boys. You ever hear of &quot;Superman?&quot; And I don't mean the comic book.
No.
No.
Wait'll you see!
Mikey, why would they ever hit poor old Frankie Five-Angels? I loved that ole sonuvabitch. I remember when he was just a 'button,' when we were kids. We used to put bedsheets on our heads, you know, like we were ghosts. An' ole Frankie come peek into our room, we'd jump up, and he'd always pretend like he was really scared. You remember?
It was hard to have him killed.

How is your wife, Fredo...your marriage?
You know her; drives me crazy, one minute she's a popsicle, the next she's all vinegar. Sometimes I think... I think - I should a married someone, like you did. To have kids, to have a family.
&quot;Yo soy un hombre sincero...&quot; I am a sincere man, From the land of the palms...
What's that?
What's that?
The song. Are you sincere with me, Fredo?

I know they get Pentangeli, that's all I know.
I didn't know it was a hit. I swear to you I didn't know. Johnny Ola contacted me in Beverly Hills -- said he wanted to talk. He said you and Roth were in on some big deal, and there was a place for me in it if I could help them out. They said you were being tough on the negotiation, and if

Taken care of me. Mike, you're my kid brother, and you take care of my. Did you ever think of that. Ever once? Send Fredo off to do this, send Fredo to take care of that... take care of some little unimportant night club here, and there; pick somebody up at the airport. Mike, I'm your older brother; I was stepped over!

You're nothing to me now, Fredo; not a brother, not a friend, I don't want to know you, or what happens to you. I don't want to see you at the hotels, or near my home. When you visit our Mother, I want to know a day in advance, so I won't be there. Do you understand?
I know what you are thinking, Vitone, but you don't understand yet how things are. Fanucci is of the Black Hand. Everyone in the neighborhood pays him, even my father.
He's an Italian?
He's an Italian?
A pig of a Neaponitan.
Why? Why does he bother other Italians?
Because he knows them; he knows they have no one to protect them. Vitone? What do you think of my angel?

Some guys from Ninth Avenue jumped Fanucci today; slit his throat from ear to ear.

No, I didn't know. Is he dead?

Why?
Why?
Because he's what we say... &quot;connected&quot;... You wait, see what happens to those guys from Ninth Avenue.
What did I tell you. The one who cut him was found in an alley. And the family of the others paid Fanucci all their savings to make him forswear his vengeance.
And he agreed?
And he agreed?
He took the money. Now he wants double from everybody in the neighborhood, including Papa.
The 'patrone' is here.
Chi?

... He said he had shot his Grandfather with a gun, and then he died in the garden. And he asked me... he asked me, Tom, if that meant now his father would shoot him out of... revenge. How does a four year old boy learn the word... 'revenge'?
Kay... Kay...
Kay... Kay...
What kind of a family is this... are we human beings? He knows his Father killed his Uncle Carlo. He heard Connie.

You don't know that's true. But Kay, just for the sake of an argument, let's assume it is, I'm not saying it is, remember, but... What if I gave you what might be some justification for what he did... or rather some possible justification for what he possibly did.

That's the first time I've seen the lawyer side of you, Tom. It's not your best side.
That's the first time I've seen the lawyer side of you, Tom. It's not your best side.
Okay, just hear me out. What if Carlo had been paid to help get Sonny killed? What if his beating of Connie that time was a deliberate plot to get Sonny out into the open? Then what? And what if the Don, a great man, couldn't bring himself to do what he had to do, avenge his son's death by killing his daughter's husband?

What the hell does that mean? Come on, Tom, speak out straight once in your life. I know Michael can't, but you're not Sicilian, you can tell a woman the truth; you can treat her like an equal, a fellow human being.
If you told Michael what I've told you today, I'm a dead man.
When is it finally over? I want it to be over before my baby is born.
When is it finally over? I want it to be over before my baby is born.
I don't know. I hope soon; but it's not over yet, and that's why you and the kids have to come back to me.
Where's my wife?
With Mama, putting the baby to sleep. Francesca's very happy. Michael was kind to her. She idolizes him. The children are all out in the speedboat. I'm going to my house.
He doesn't want my help any more. He doesn't need it.
We don't know that's true, he never said that.
We don't know that's true, he never said that.
I can feel it in the way he talks to me.
Just now when Johnny Ola showed up, he asked me to leave them alone. Ola is Hyman Roth's Sicilian contact. I was on the inside of ten, twenty meetings with him. But today Mike asked me to leave, like an outsider.
Talk to him. Tell him how you feel.
Talk to him. Tell him how you feel.
It's as though he blames me for the ground the family lost when I was Consigliere to Sonny.
Hello?
She's gone, Tom.
What do you mean gone?
The Barretts from Rubicon Bay came by in a new speedboat. Rocco tried to say she wasn't in, but Kay spotted them and asked if they would take her and the kids for a ride. That was three hours ago.

Why didn't someone tell me!

I wanted to tell you alone; your wife doesn't know what's going on.
You're going to talk to him now.
Yes.
Yes.
Will you tell him?
Will you tell him?
I don't know.
Rocco!

Goddamn it, where were you?
Goddamn it, where were you?
I was in my house. Willy tried, but it would have taken some strong-arm to stop her, and he figured you wouldn't want that.
She took a flight to San Francisco. We figure she's going to connect to New Hampshire; her parents' place.
I can't let him down.
Me too, Tom?
Yeah, give me a minute.
I'm sorry; of course, you know that.
Two-thirty. That gives me time to see my boy.
Two-thirty. That gives me time to see my boy.
Connie's outside.
Tom isn't going to sit in with us, Johnny. He only handles specific areas of the family business. Tom?
Sure, Mikey.
If you need anything, just...
Just tell Rocco I'm waiting.
There's a lot I can't tell you, Tom. I know that's upset you in the past; and you've felt that it was because of some lack of trust or confidence. But it is because I do trust you that I've kept so much secret from you. It's precisely that at this moment, you are the only one that I can completely trust. In time,
But your people... Neri... Rocco; you don't think...
But your people... Neri... Rocco; you don't think...
No, I have confidence in their loyalty... but this is life and death, and Tom, you are my brother.
Mikey, I hoped...
No Tom, just listen. All my people are businessmen; their loyalty is based on that. One thing I learned from my father is to try to think as the people around you think...and on that basis, anything is possible. Fredo has a good heart, but he is weak...and stupid, and stupid people are the most dangerous of all. I've kept you out of things,
I've prepared this; have had it for over a month. It won't explain everything; but indicates where I will be, so in a sense, it is my life. Also, there are three tasks that must be executed immediately. Pop would have given those to Luca -- You knew Pop as well as anyone, act as though you were him. It discusses Kay as well;
Will we...be able to get who ordered it out of them?
Will we...be able to get who ordered it out of them?
I don't think so. Unless I'm very wrong...they're already dead. Killed by someone inside...very frightened that they botched it. That's why I am going to disappear in a few minutes, and leave everything to you.

But if you're wrong...
If I'm wrong...
Do you think they have somebody to back up Cicci?
No. But if they do have somebody, you'll do three years for perjury if you give them so much as a wrong middle name.
Did the boy get something from me for Christmas?
I took care of it.
I took care of it.
What was it, so I'll know.
What was it, so I'll know.
A little care he can ride in with an electric motor.
Where's my brother?
Roth got out on a private boat. He's in a hospital in Miami. Had a stroke but he's recovered okay. Bussetta's dead.

The new government arrested him, held him for a couple of days with a lot of the other casino people, including Roth's brother, Sam. The American Embassy arranged flights for citizens; I'm not sure, but I think he's somewhere in New York.

How did they get their hands on Pentangeli?
Roth engineered it, Michael. He made Pentangeli think you hit him. Deliberately letting him get off alive. Then the New York detectives turned Frankie over to the FBI. My informants say he was half dead and scared stiff -- talking out loud that you had turned on him and tried to kill him. Anyway, they had him on possession, dealing in heroin, murder one
He says he doesn't know anything, and I believe him. Roth played this one beautifully.
Alright. I'm going to go outside and talk to Fredo.
Sit down, Tom. Have you heard about our friend and partner, Mr. Hyman Roth?
I know he's in Israel.
They won't take him; not for a million, not for ten million.
His medical condition is reported as... &quot;terminal.&quot;

I'm surprised at you, Tom. If there's anything certain; certain in life; if history has taught us anything, it's that you can kill... ANYBODY. But perhaps your relucatance is because you've come to tell me that you're moving your family to Vegas, that you've been offered the Vice-Presidency of the Houstan Hotels there. Or weren't you going to tell me at all?

I turned Houstan down; I didn't see why I should tell you about an offer I turned down. Are you sure, Mikey? Are you sure of what we're doing; what we'll gain; what does the family gain? Forget that, Mike; I already know the answer.

I know you do, Tom. Then I can count on you to help me do the things I have to do. If not, call Houstan, and become a Vice-President. Take your family and your mistress and move them to Las Vegas.

Good. Then you're staying.

I'm staying. Don't ever enjoy the cruel part of all this; Sonny never listened to me about that. Now, explain everything to me.
Fifteen percent skim?
Twenty-five this time.
It might show.
Mike wants it.
We've never sent this much with one courier.
Your plans are a little different this time. You skip Miami, and go straight to Geneva. It's to be deposited to this number. And it's got to be there by Monday morning, no slip-up.
What's up?
No questions.
No questions.
I got to ask questions, Tom, there's three million dollars cash in that pouch; Mike is gone and I have no word from him.

How do I know you haven't gone into business for yourself?
The High Court of Israel turned down his request to live as a 'returned Jew.' His passport's been invalidated except for return to the U.S. He landed in Buenos Aires yesterday, offered a gift of one million dollars if they would give him citizenship. They turned him down.
He's going to try Panama...
I think I prefer to see my client privately.
The room has a bug in it.

I'd like to go outside with him, in the open air.
Everything is going to be okay, Frankie, don't worry.
Did my brother go back?
Did my brother go back?
Yeah, but don't worry.
Yeah, but don't worry.
He's ten times tougher than me, my brother. He's old-fashioned.
He's ten times tougher than me, my brother. He's old-fashioned.
Yeah. He wouldn't even go out to dinner. Just wanted to go home.
Yeah. He wouldn't even go out to dinner. Just wanted to go home.
That's my brother. Nothing could get him away from that two mule town. He coulda been big over here -- he could of had his own Family.
That's my brother. Nothing could get him away from that two mule town. He coulda been big over here -- he could of had his own Family.
You're right.
You're right.
Tom, what do I do now?
Frankie, you were always interested in politics, in history. I remember you talking about Hitler back in '43. We were young then.
Yeah, I still read a lot. They bring me stuff.
Yeah, I still read a lot. They bring me stuff.
You were around the old timers who dreamed up how the Families should be organized, how they based it on the old Roman Legions, and called them 'Regimes'... with the 'Capos' and 'Soldiers,' and it worked.

Yeah, it worked. Those were great old days. We was like the Roman Empire. The Corleone family was like the Roman Empire.
Yeah, it worked. Those were great old days. We was like the Roman Empire. The Corleone family was like the Roman Empire.
Yeah, it was once.
The Roman Empire... when a plot against the Emperor failed, the plotters were always given a chance to let their families keep their fortunes.
Yeah, but only the rich guys. The little guys got knocked off. If they got arrested and executed, all their estate went to the Emperor. If they just went home and killed themselves, up front, nothing happened.
Yeah, but only the rich guys. The little guys got knocked off. If they got arrested and executed, all their estate went to the Emperor. If they just went home and killed themselves, up front, nothing happened.
Yeah, that was a good break. A nice deal.
Don't worry about anything, Frankie Five-Angels.
Thanks, Tom. Thanks.
...and the tape will be running.
Actually, I've come with good news; the Corleone family has done you a favor.
What the hell are you talking about?
We know you're a busy man, with plenty of enemies -- we saw the opportunity to do you a favor, and we did. No strings.

Do you owe markers?

Maybe two, three thousand dollars.
There's thirty grand worth of paid off markers -- I never owed that much.
Our mistake. But what does it matter; it was our money. We don't even expect thanks.

Mr. Hagen, would you kindly identify to this committee that gentleman sitting on your right hand?
Yes, sir. His name is Vincenzo Pentangeli.
Yes, sir. His name is Vincenzo Pentangeli.
Is he related to the witness?
Is he related to the witness?
He is, I believe, a brother.
Sir, the gentleman does not understand English. He would not in any case, take the stand. He came, at his own expense, to aid his brother in his trouble. He is not under any jurisdiction of our government and his reputation in his own country is impeccable.
The witness is excused; take him out.
Senator Kane.

How's the baby?
Sleeping inside me.

Does it feel like a boy?

I'm sorry about some of the people I had to see today. It was bad timing... but it couldn't be helped.
I'm sorry about some of the people I had to see today. It was bad timing... but it couldn't be helped.
It made me think of what you told me once. In five years, the Corleone family will be completely legitimate. That was seven years ago.
Leave her alone! You're talking as though she has no right to be frightened when there are machine guns going off in her backyard.
Have Tom Hagen meet me in the Harbor House.
I had no idea...
I wanted to see you before you went back to Nevada. Also, the children - Michael, they're here.
I wanted to see you before you went back to Nevada. Also, the children - Michael, they're here.

In a minute. They're outside with Esther. I'm very happy for you... I suppose I knew that you're simply too smart for anyone ever to beat you.

I think it's too late for changes, Michael. I promised myself I wouldn't talk about it and I've gone and spoiled it.

You would have killed his brother?
You would have killed his brother?
Kay, you've got it wrong. That kind of thing's all over, I promised you. This was between the two brothers. Years ago Frankie had a young girlfriend; he called her his co-wife. That was his joke, but he meant it. He wouldn't divorce his wife... because she was a great cook. He said he girlfriend made a spaghetti sauce once and it was so
When he saw his brother in the hearing room, he knew what was at stake. I don't think Vincenzo would have done it. He loves the kids, too. Omerta, Kay. Honor, silence. It had nothing to do with me. It was between those brothers.
I'll bring the children up now; they want to say goodbye.
I'll bring the children up now; they want to say goodbye.

I won't let you leave! Christ, do you think I'm going to let you leave.
I won't let you leave! Christ, do you think I'm going to let you leave.
Michael.
Michael.
No, I don't want to hear anything. There are things between men and women that will not change; things that have been the same for thousands of years. You are my wife, and they are my children... and I love you and I will not let you leave, because you are MINE!
No, I don't want to hear anything. There are things between men and women that will not change; things that have been the same for thousands of years. You are my wife, and they are my children... and I love you and I will not let you leave, because you are MINE!
Oh, I do feel things for you, Michael; but now, I think it's pity. For the first time since I've known you, you seem so helpless. You held me a prisoner once; will you try again?
Oh, I do feel things for you, Michael; but now, I think it's pity. For the first time since I've known you, you seem so helpless. You held me a prisoner once; will you try again?

We'll go back tonight. Bring the children.
We'll go back tonight. Bring the children.
You haven't heard me.
How can I let you leave; how can I let you take my children away? Don't you know me? You understand, it's an impossibility. I would never let it happen; no, never, not if it took all my strength, all my cunning. But in time, soon, you'll feel differently. You see, you'll be happy that I stopped you. I know you. You'll forget about
The baby I lost...
The baby I lost...
I know what it meant... and I'm prepared to make it up to you. I will make changes; I can. I CAN change; that I have learned, that I have the strength to change... And we have another child, a boy... and you'll forget the miscarriage.

It wasn't a miscarriage. And you with your cunning, couldn't you figure it out! It was an abortion; an abortion, like our marriage is an abortion, something unholy and evil. I don't want your son; I wouldn't bring another of your sons into this world. An abortion, Michael... it was a son, and I had it killed, but this must all end!
Are you Klingman?

Alright. They bother me once in awhile. Tell me, when Pop had troubles... did he ever think, even to himself, that he had gone the wrong way; that maybe by trying to be strong and trying to protect his family, that he could... that he could... lose it instead?

Sit down, this is almost over. You follow the baseball games?
Not for a few years.

I like sporting events -- I really enjoy watching them in the afternoon. One of the things I love about this country. I loved baseball ever since Arnold Rothstein fixed the World Series of 1919...I heard you had some trouble.

Yes.
What a mistake; people behaving like that, with guns. It was my understanding we left all that behind. But, let me tell you, the important thing is that you're all right. Good health is the most important thing; more than success; more than power; more than money.

Technically, they are still under the Clemenza wing of the Corleone Family, now run by Frankie Pentangeli. After Clemenza died, the Rosatos wanted territory of their own. Pentangeli refused, and came to me, asking for permission to eliminate them. I, of course, knew of their relationship with you, and in gratitude for your help with the Tropicana matter, turned him down. Pentangeli was furious,
Nothing is more important.
Pentangeli is a dead man; do you object?

Of course you must keep control of your family.
I still don't speak Spanish, Michael.
It means... &quot;The Lie.&quot;
Enjoy.
I saw an interesting thing today. A man was being arrested by the Military Police; probably an urban guerrilla. Rather than be taken alive, he exploded a grenade hidden in his jacket, taking the command vehicle with him.
You have to be careful what you say in front of the others... they frighten easy. It's always been that way, most men frighten easy.
We're making a big investment in Cuba. That's my only concern.

My concern is that the three million never arrived at Batista's numbered account in Switzerland. He thinks it's because you have second thoughts about his ability to stop the rebels.

Then you have to trace it. Michael, people here look at me as a reliable man. I can't afford not to be looked on as a reliable man. But you know all that; there's nothing you can learn from me. You shouldn't have to put up with a sick old man as a partner.

I wouldn't consider anyone else.
I wouldn't consider anyone else.
Except the President of the United States.
If only I could live to see it, kid; to be there with you. How beautifully we've done it, step by step. Here, protected, free to make our profits without the Justice Department, the FBI; ninety miles away in partnership with a friendly government. Ninety miles, just a small step, looking for a man who desperately wants to be President of the United States,
You'll be there to see it; you'll be there.
This doubles my investment.
Still no word of your courier? We'll find him. But at least this will satisfy our friends here. You've been invited to the New Year reception at the Presidential Home. I understand your brother is here as well; I hope he'll come.

Six million dollars in cash is a high price for a piece of a country in the middle of a revolution.
You're a careful kid, and that's good. But look. An international dispatch on the wire service. American journalism, not propaganda. The government troops have all but eliminated the rebels. All but their radio station.
I've read it; I'm pleased that the government is doing so well. As a heavy investor, I'm pleased. How did the doctor find you?

Why...the Rosato Brothers.

I know that; but who gave the go ahead.
I know it wasn't me...so that leaves you.
There was this kid that I grew up with; he was a couple years younger than me, and sort of looked up to me, you know. We did our first work together, worked our way out of the street. Things were good and we made the most of it. During prohibition, we ran molasses up to Canada and made a fortune; your father too.
Hiya, Mr. Corleone, I'm Sam Roth. Welcome to the Capri; my brother's upstairs. You wanta take a rest before you see him, or can I get you something, anything at all?
No, I'm fine.
This is it! We think it makes Vegas look like the corner crap game.
Very impressive.
Very impressive.
Jake, Jake, come over here. Mike, I want you to meet Jake Cohen; he manages the casino for us.
It occurred to me: the police are paid to fight, and the Rebels are not.
So?
So?
So, that occurred to me.
You know my lawyer, Tom Hagen. Johnny Ola.
Sure, I remember Tom from the old days.
I just left our friend in Miami.
How is his health?

Is there anything I can do; anything I can send?

He appreciates your concern, Michael, and your respect.
The hotel's registered owners are one Jacob Lawrence, and Sidney Barclay, both Beverly Hills attorneys. In reality it's split between the Old Lakeville Road Group from Cleveland, and our friend in Miami. He takes care of others outside the country, you know who I mean. Meyer Klingman runs the store, and does all right, but I've been instructed to tell you, that if you
He's very kind, tell him it's appreciated. I'm sure it will be profitable all the way around.
He's very kind, tell him it's appreciated. I'm sure it will be profitable all the way around.
He always makes money for his partners. One by one, our old friends are gone. Death, natural or not, prison, deported. Our friend in Miami is the only one left, because he always made money for his partners.
They asked him to sign paper to take down the markers; but he got mad; told them to wait until he was finished.
Let him gamble.
Let him gamble.
Okay. You know he doesn't have that kind of money.
Are you the son of Vito Corleone?
Yes.
I'm sure we all agree with our esteemed colleague. Now, Mr. Corleone, you have been advised as to your legal rights. We have had testimony from a preceding witness who states you are head of the most powerful Mafia family in this country. Are you?
No.
No.
This witness has testified that you are personally responsible for the murder of a New York Police Captain in the year 1947 and with him a man named Virgil Sollozzo. Do you deny this?

That is not true. I own some stock in some of the hotels, but only very small amounts. I also own some American Telephone and IBM stock.
Mr. Corleone, do you have any hotel interests in the state of Arizona? Or any gambling interests in that state?
I do not.
I do not.
Do you have interests or control over gambling and narcotics in the state of New York.

Sure, Pete Clemenza died of a heart attack, but the Rosato Brothers gave it to him.
We were all heartbroken at the news; but that wasn't cause to start a war.
We were all heartbroken at the news; but that wasn't cause to start a war.
Okay, now it's my family in Brooklyn; and I wanna keep up Clemenza's loyalty to you. But how can I run my family with you challenging my every move? You're too far from the street, Mike, the only way to reason with the Rosato Brothers is to whack 'em and whack 'em fast.

How can you be fair with animals? They recruit niggers and spicks; they do violence in their own Grandmother's neighborhoods. And everything is dope and whores; the gambling is left to last. Let me run my family without you on my back. I want them taken care of.

It would be the beginning of the end for my family. How can I keep all my other territories in like if I let two wise-guys stand up and demand this and that, and then give it to them?

This was my father's old study. When I was a kid, we had to be quiet when we played near here. When I was older, I learned many things from him here. I was happy that this house never went to strangers; first Clemenza took it over, and then you. My father taught me, in this room, never to act until you know everything

The Corleone family controls two major hotels in Vegas; one in Reno. The licenses were grandfathered in, so you had no difficulties with the Gaming Commission. But I have the idea from sources... ...that you're planning to move in on the Tropicana. In another week or so you'll move Klingman out, which leaves you with only one technicality.

Let's forget the bullshit, I don't want to stay here any longer than I have to. You can have the license for two hundred and fifty thousand in cash, plus a monthly fee equal to five percent of the gross...
Senator Geary, I speak to you as a businessman who has made a large investment in your state. I have made that state my home; plan to raise my children here. The license fee from the Gambling Commission costs one thousand dollars; why would I ever consider paying more?
I'm going to squeeze you, Corleone, because I don't like you; I don't like the kind of man you are. I despise your masquerade, and the dishonest way you pose yourself and your fucking family.
We're all part of the same hypocrisy, Senator. But never think it applies to my family.
All right, then let me say you'll pay me because it's in your interests to pay me.
They're still on the property. Maybe you better stay inside.
Keep them alive.
We'll try.
It's important.
Your family all seem to be okay in the other houses; your Mother's still sleeping.
And?
And?
No sign of them yet; but they're still on the Estate.
On the phone?
No, she's here.

We want Brooklyn one hundred percent. No more taxes to you. We want to be only loosely connected with your family -- sort of a under-family all of our own. Then we can act on all internal matters without talking. Also we want you to inform Michael Corleone that we can deal directly with him.

That's a lucky C note for our new deal.
I have already rented the apartment to another family.
I told her I would speak to you, that you are a reasonable man who acted out of some misunderstanding. She has gotten rid of the animal that caused all the trouble, so why shouldn't she stay. As one Italian to another, I ask you the favor.

How much more a month?
How much more a month?
Eh... Five dollars more.
Here is the six month's increase in advance. You needn't speak to her about it, she's a proud woman. See me again in another six months. But of course, you'll let her keep her dog.
Like hell! And who the hell are you to give me orders. Watch your manners or you'll be on your Sicilian ass in the street there.
Excuse me, I hope I am not a disturbance, Don Corleone.
Yes.
Yes.
What a terrible misunderstanding. Of course, Signora Colombo can stay in the flat. Who were those miserable tenants to complain about noise from a poor animal...when they pay such low rent.
Your good heart in helping the poor widow has shamed me, and I want to show that I, too, have some Christian charity. Her rent will remain what it was.
What was that?
What was that?
In fact, reduced, bu five dollars!
I accept your generosity...
I won't keep you another minute...

I'm not a kid.
I'm not a kid.
What are you then? What will you be ten years from now? Still cutting lawns? Still banging horny divorcees in your trailer?
I like my life. I'm a free man.
Sure you're free, for now at least. But how long before you're just alone? Pathetic and alone.
So you don't want to fuck. That's what you're telling me?
Is that all this conversation means to you? Am I going to put out or not?
Is that all this conversation means to you? Am I going to put out or not?
Damn straight. I'm sick of playing games.
Don't worry, you already paid me. I'm here because --

Take care of Mr. Whale like he was your flesh and blood.
Take care of Mr. Whale like he was your flesh and blood.
It is my job. I did it when he was happy and it was easy. It is only fair I do it now when he is ill. Enough talk. I must wake up the master.

I stink to high heaven right now.

I have no interest in your body, Mr. Boone. I can assure you of that.
All right then. Sure. I could use the extra dough.
Excellent. We'll have a most interesting time.
Did you see this? They're showing one of your movies tomorrow night.
You don't say? Which picture?
You don't say? Which picture?
"Bride of Frankenstein."
"Bride of Frankenstein."
Hmmm. I much prefer "Show Boat" or "The Invisible Man." Shall we begin?
That shirt, Mr. Boone.
It's new.
It's new.
I'm sorry. It's too white, too distracting. Would it be asking too much for you to take it off?

Oh if it's going to make you uncomfortable... Perhaps we can find something else for you to wear.
We could wrap this like a toga around your shoulders. Would that help you overcome your schoolgirl shyness?
All right already. I'll take it off. Kind of warm in here anyway.
Take a picture, it lasts longer.
That's exactly what I intend to do.
Would you be more comfortable barefoot? Feel free to remove your boots and socks.
No. I'm fine.
No. I'm fine.
It's a bit like being at the doctor, isn't it? You have to remain perfectly still while I examine and scrutinize you.
Dripping? Do you ever eat dripping in this country? The fat from roasts and such, congealed in jars. Used like butter on bread.
Sounds like something you feed the dog.

What?
What?
I've spent most of my life outrunning my past. Now it's flooding all over me.
There's something about the openness of your face that makes me want to speak the truth. Yes, my family ate dripping. Beef dripping and four to a bed, and a privy out back in the alley. Are you also from the slums, Mr. Boone?
We weren't rich. But we weren't poor either.
We weren't rich. But we weren't poor either.
No, you were middle class, like all Americans.

In Dudley there were more sides of the tracks than any American can imagine. Every Englishman knows his place. And if you forget, there's always someone to remind you. My family had no doubts about who they were. But I was an aberration in that household a freak of nature. I had imagination, cleverness, joy. Where did I get that? Certainly not from them.
You have to excuse me, Mr. Boone. Since my stroke, I am often overcome with nostalgia.
I don't mind. I'm not crazy about my old man either.
How are you, Mr. Boone? So glad you are free for lunch.
All right, I guess.
All right, I guess.
I assume you worked up an appetite with your labor.
Do you mind?
Go ahead.
Is this David's doing?

This David's a friend?
Yes. An old, useless friend. You must excuse me, Mr. Boone. This is a world I finished with long ago. I pay them no mind and expect them to return the compliment. Lunch should be ready. Shall we?
Saw your movie the other night. Watched it with some friends.
Did you now?
Did you now?
I liked it. We all did.
I liked it. We all did.
Did anyone laugh?
Did anyone laugh?
No.
No.
Pity. People are so earnest nowadays.
Pity. People are so earnest nowadays.
Why? Was it supposed to be funny?
Why? Was it supposed to be funny?
Of course. I had to make it interesting for myself, you see. A comedy about death. The trick is not to ruin it for anyone who isn't in on the joke. But the Monster never receives any of my gibes. He is noble. Noble and misunderstood.
Did you kill anyone?
I don't like to talk about that.
I don't like to talk about that.
It's nothing to be ashamed of, in the service of one's country. That's something to be proud of.

Quite true. Hand-to-hand combat is the true test. Did you ever slay anyone hand-to-hand?

No. I could have, though.
No. I could have, though.
Yes, I believe you could. How free is your schedule this afternoon?

Full up. I got the hedges to do here, then another lawn out by La Cienega.

What is we say phooey to the hedges? Could you spare an hour after lunch? To sit for me?

Can't today.

I'll pay our going rate. Plus what you'd get if you did the hedges.

Sorry. I don't feel like sitting still today.
Sorry. I don't feel like sitting still today.
All righty. I understand.
Just a trim. And mine while you're at it. Fingers are a bit stiff today.
You ever been married, Mr. Whale?
You ever been married, Mr. Whale?
No. At least not in the legal sense.
So you had a wife?
Or a husband. Depending on which of us you asked. My friend David. He lived here for many years.
Does that surprise you?
No, I -- you're a homosexual.
No, I -- you're a homosexual.
Oh dear. If one must have a clinical name.
Oh dear. If one must have a clinical name.
I'm not, you know.
I'm not, you know.
I never thought you were.

You don't think of me that way, do you?

What way might that be?
What way might that be?
You know. Look at me like -- like I look at women.
You know. Look at me like -- like I look at women.
Don't be ridiculous. I know a real man like you would break my neck if I so much as laid a hand on him. Besides, you're not my type.
So we understand each other?
What you do is no business of mine. Live and let live, I say.

I hope this has nothing to do with your refusing to sit for me today?

No. I --
Can I see what you did so far?
It will only make you self-conscious. You'll have to remove your shirt.
It will only make you self-conscious. You'll have to remove your shirt.
Sorry. Not today.
Sorry. Not today.
But we have to match the other sketch.
But we have to match the other sketch.
I just feel more comfortable keeping it on. You just said you didn't want me self-conscious.
Oh dear. I <u>have</u> made you nervous.
I'm fine. I'd just rather keep it on.
I'm fine. I'd just rather keep it on.
Suppose we unbutton the top and pull it down around your shoulders? Two buttons. Is that so much to ask? Just two little buttons.
I don't mean to be a prick, but that's how I feel.
Of course. I don't want to scare you off. Not before I'm finished with you.
Tell me more about yourself, Mr. Boone. You have a steady companion?
Not at the moment.
Not at the moment.
Why not?
Why not?
You know how it is. You have to kiss ass just to get a piece of it.
You know how it is. You have to kiss ass just to get a piece of it.
Very well put.

The world is just one kiss-ass game after another. A man has to make up his own life, alone.

I like that. But take care, Mr. Boone. Freedom is a drug, much like any other. Too much can be a very bad thing.
Is that why you and your friend split up? Because you wanted to be free?
In a way, yes. I suppose so. I know it's why I stopped making pictures.
You might not think it to look at me now, but there was a time when I was at the very pinnacle of my profession. The horror movies were behind me. I'd done "Show Boat." Major success. Great box office. Now I was to do something important. "The Road Back." An indictment of the Great War and what it did to Germany. It was
What happened?
What happened?
The fucking studio butchered it. It was 1937, Hitler's armies were already massing -- and still the New York bankers stood in line to curry his favor. Anything to avoid losing the German market. They cut away the guts and brought in another director to add slapstick. The picture laid an egg, a great expensive bomb. For which I was blamed.
After that, I went out of fashion. I was no longer able to command the best projects, so I walked away. Why should I spend my time working in such a dreadful business?
Do you miss it?
Do you miss it?
It's so far in the past now. Over fifteen years --
I think we all want to feel we've left our mark on the world. Yes. I wish I had done more work.
You've done a helluva lot more than most people.
You've done a helluva lot more than most people.
Better work.
But I chose freedom. David was still in the thick of it, his life full of anxiety and studio intrigue. I didn't fancy spending my golden years as merely "the friend." The dirty little secret of a nervous producer.
How long were you...?
How long were you...?
Twenty years. Too long. We were like a play whose run outlasted the cast's ability to keep it fresh. So I finally decided to close down the show.
Of course, they weren't nearly as bashful. No, this room was once filled with bare buttocks. And pricks. Hard, arrogant pricks --
Cut it out!
Isn't it enough you told me you're a fairy? Do you have to rub my nose in it?
I assure you, Mr. Boone, I meant no --
I assure you, Mr. Boone, I meant no --
From now on, Mr. Whale, I cut your grass and that's it. Understand?
The extras are in their places. Now we need the star. Wouldn't you like to get in the pool?
You first.
You first.
Oh no. I never swim.
Mr. Boone. You're not due to cut the lawn until Wednesday.
I'd like to sit for you again. But only if you ease up on the locker room talk. Okay?
I'm curious, Mr. Boone. What convinced you to come back?
I don't know. I guess I like your stories.
I don't know. I guess I like your stories.
Everybody has stories to tell.

Not me.

What about your stint in Korea? I'm sure it was full of dramatic episodes.
What about your stint in Korea? I'm sure it was full of dramatic episodes.
I told you. I don't like to talk about that.
And the fear you showed at our last session? How did you overcome that?
Not fear. More like disgust.
Not fear. More like disgust.
Same difference, Mr. Boone. Disgust, fear of the unknown -- all part of the great gulf that stands between us. Am I right in assuming that you've had little experience with men of my persuasion?

This was World War I?

Barnett. Was that his name? Leonard Barnett. He came to the front straight from Harrow. And he looked up to me. Unlike the others, he didn't care that I was a workingman impersonating his betters. How strange, to be admired so blindly. I suppose he loved me. But chastely, like a schoolboy.
Something happened to him?
You will not set me on another walk down memory lane. Not this lane. Not today.
I didn't --
I didn't --
Why do I tell you this? I never told David. I never even remembered it until you got me going.

You're the one who started it.

You asked me to model. Remember?

Of course I remember. Do you think I'm so senile --
Just go. Please. Why don't you go?
I don't get it. First you creep me out with homo shit. Then you hit me with war stories. And now you're upset because I listen? What do you want?

No harm done.

You don't want me to sit for you anymore?
If you don't mind driving, I'd like to take you as my guest. There should be lots of pretty starlets to keep you amused.
I'm game. Sure.
I'm game. Sure.
Very good, Clayton. May I call you Clayton? Or do you prefer Boone?
Very good, Clayton. May I call you Clayton? Or do you prefer Boone?
Clayton is fine.
Good afternoon, Clayton.
Do I look okay?
I suppose you'd like the top down.
If that's okay?
If that's okay?
Nothing would please me more.
What did I tell you? Listen.
I don't hear anything.
I don't hear anything.
Exactly. Cukor was too cheap to hire music. There's nothing but chin-wag. The cold dreary custard of English chin-wag.
What was that about?
Nothing of importance. Just two old men slapping each other with lilies. Shall we have a drink?
Who's that?
David. The friend I thought was in New York.
David. The friend I thought was in New York.
No. The girl.
No. The girl.
Girl? Oh. Elizabeth Taylor.
Is that really her?
David produced her last picture.
Are you enjoying yourself?
Actually, no. I feel a little out of place.

Neither of us really belongs here.

Must have been funny for you. Seeing your monsters again.

Monsters? The only monsters... ...are here.
Oh fuck. And we left the top down. You want to run for it?
Run for what?
Run for what?
Can't you see? It's raining!
Let's get out of this funk hole
You don't want to wait it out? Rain should let up soon.
You don't want to wait it out? Rain should let up soon.
We're not sugar. We won't melt.
I better get you home before you catch your death from pneumonia.
Catch my death.
It's not like her.
Just a night out. Sounds like she can't say no to her daughter.

Certainly you have better things to do than babysit an old man?

Good. Let's get dry.
Oh, of course. Clayton. You finished your shower already?
Ten minutes ago. Didn't you hear me calling?
Ten minutes ago. Didn't you hear me calling?
I'm afraid not. Terribly sorry. I believe I promised you some clothes.
You're much wider than I am. You won't want to attempt to get into my pants.
No. Definitely not.
That only leaves the rest.
You don't have any baggy shorts? Pajama bottoms?
You don't have any baggy shorts? Pajama bottoms?
Sorry. My pajamas are tailored. Would it be too distressing to continue with the towel? No more immodest than a kilt, you know.
Sorry. My pajamas are tailored. Would it be too distressing to continue with the towel? No more immodest than a kilt, you know.
Do I have any other choice?
Do I have any other choice?
Very sporting of you, Clayton.
Is that --?
The only memento I ever kept. My original sketch for the Monster.
After dinner, if Hanna isn't back? Can we try a few more sketches?
I thought you'd given up on my picture.
I thought you'd given up on my picture.
I'd like to try again. If you're game.
I'd like to try again. If you're game.
Why not? Give us something to do while we wait.
Tell me something, Clayton. Do you believe in mercy killing?
Never gave it much thought.
Never gave it much thought.
Come now. I'm sure you came across such situations in Korea. A wounded comrade, or perhaps one of the enemy? Someone for whom death would be a blessing.
I never made it to Korea.
But you said --
But you said --
-- that I was a Marine. Which is true. You filled in the rest.

I see.
My old man was a Marine. He enlisted the day he turned seventeen.
The Great War?
The Great War?
By the time he was ready to ship out, the fighting was over. He missed out.
By the time he was ready to ship out, the fighting was over. He missed out.
A very lucky thing indeed.
A very lucky thing indeed.
That's not the way he saw it. To him, it was like his life never got started. Nothing else really mattered. Definitely not his family.
The morning after Pearl Harbor, he drove down to St. Louis to reenlist. He was so damn excited. World War II was going to be his second chance. They told him he was too old...fat ...nearsighted. Said he'd be more use to his country if he stayed home and looked after his family.
Is that why you joined the Marines? For your father's sake?
Is that why you joined the Marines? For your father's sake?
I figured he'd think, you know -- it was the next best thing. Hey, I loved it too. A chance to be a part of something important. Something bigger than yourself.

What happened?
What happened?
I didn't have the guts for it.
You know what he did when I called him? He laughed. He laughed so hard he practically burst a blood vessel. Said it was a good lesson for me. Not to try to fill his shoes.
I'm very sorry.
I'm very sorry.
Them's the breaks, right? No war stories for this pup.
Them's the breaks, right? No war stories for this pup.
That's where you're wrong, Clayton. You've just told one. A very good story indeed.
Do you mind?
Not at all.
Storm's getting worse.
"A perfect night for mystery and horror. The air itself is filled with monsters."
"A perfect night for mystery and horror. The air itself is filled with monsters."
That's from your movie, right? "The only monsters are here."

I don't remember that one.
I don't remember that one.
James Whale. This afternoon at the party.
I said it must be weird seeing your monsters again, and you said, "The only monsters are here." I was wondering which here you meant.
I don't recall. Memories of the war, perhaps.
I don't recall. Memories of the war, perhaps.

Barnett. Barnett on the wire.
Your friend?
Oh death where is thy sting-a-ling? Grave where thy victory?
You survived it. It can't hurt you now. It's no good to dig it up.
You survived it. It can't hurt you now. It's no good to dig it up.
Oh no, my friend. It's digging itself up. There is nothing in the here and now to take my mind off it. All my diversions have abandoned me. Parties. Reading. Painting. Work. Love. All gone to me now.
So it is going to happen after all.
What'd you say?
No. It won't do.
What won't do?
What won't do?
You are much too human.
You are much too human.
What did you expect? Bronze?

Don't move.
Why?
For the artistic effect. The combination of your human body and that inhuman mask. It's quite striking.

Please, Clayton. Just for a minute. Long enough for me to see the effect.

It's from the first World War, isn't it?
It's from the first World War, isn't it?
There are straps in back.
All right. Let's take it off now.
What was that?
What was that?
It's too tight.
Just take off the fucking mask!
Relax, Clayton. I can't hear you. I can't hear a word.
I'm not that way. Get it through your fucking head. I don't want to mess with you.
Oh, but you feel good, Clayton.
Wait until I tell my friends I had you naked in my arms. Won't they be surprised?
I haven't done a damn thing with you!
I haven't done a damn thing with you!
Oh, but you have. You undressed for me. I kissed you. I even touched your prick. How will you be able to live with yourself?
Break my neck. Or strangle me. It would be oh so easy to wrap your hands around my neck and choke the life out of me. Please, Clayton. We've come this far.
You're crazy.
Look, if you want to die do it yourself!
No, I don't want to die alone. But to be killed by you -- that would make death bearable. They say you never see the one with your name on it. But I want to see death coming at me. I want it to be sharp and hard, with a human face. Your face. Think, Clayton. You'd be my second Monster. Almost as famous
You okay?
Oh Clayton.
Oh Clayton.
Did I hurt you?
Did I hurt you?
Nothing I didn't deserve.
Nothing I didn't deserve.
Need some help?
Need some help?
Pray you, undo this button.
I can undress myself, thank you.
All right.
When you die...be sure your brain is the last organ to fizzle --
You'll feel better tomorrow.
You'll feel better tomorrow.
Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow...
Boone! You awake? Eight o'clock.
Fuck off!
Fuck off!
You told me to get you up, asshole.
I'm up. Thanks.
Hasta la vista, Boone. And give the jail bait a squeeze for me.
I liked it. You learn stuff listening to old-timers.
You ever hear of this Whale fellow?
This kisser wasn't so bad you couldn't lay under it a few times.
Ooooh.
You coming, Boone?
I think I'll hang around.
Hey, Boone.
Have a drink?
Can't say that I have. Can't say I've heard of a lot of people though.
If you don't believe me, let's watch this movie. See if his name's on it. How about it, Harry? Can I watch my damn movie?
If you don't believe me, let's watch this movie. See if his name's on it. How about it, Harry? Can I watch my damn movie?
I told you. I don't turn on the TV except for the fights.
Calm down, Clay. Just calm down. We'll watch it.
Good. Fine.
You're like a dog with a bone over this movie, Clay.
I just want to watch it, okay?
Sick stuff. Necrophilia. I wonder if they knew how sick they were.
The Monster's lonely and he wants a friend, a girlfriend, somebody. What sick about that?
Go home, Clay. We're closing up.
I thought I'd give you a hand since I kept you open.
Where's Betty?
She took the night off. Heavy date. Some guy she's had her eye on for a while.
She tells me you haven't been sleeping well.
It's the ridiculous pills they prescribe. If I take them, I spend the next day stupid as a stone. If I don't, my mind seems to go off in a hundred directions at once --

I wanted to be alert for your visit today. Especially since I saw so little of you in the hospital.
I'm sorry, Jimmy. But with this movie and two difficult stars --
"The fault, dear David, is not in ourselves but in our stars."
"The fault, dear David, is not in ourselves but in our stars."

Oh, David. There's no pleasure in making you feel guilty. You better go, my boy. You'll be late for that aeroplane.
By the way, I like the Renoir.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Goodbye, Hanna.
What are you doing here?
Just what I was about to ask you. I thought you were in New York.
Just what I was about to ask you. I thought you were in New York.
I was, until last night. Publicity asked me to fly Miss Taylor in for today's reception.
Should you be drinking in your condition?
Oh, David, stop being a nanny.
You should have seen Georgie's face when he met Clayton.
You didn't, Jimmy.
You didn't, Jimmy.
I did. But Princess Margaret was a doll. We're all equals in her eyes. As commoners, I presume.

Well the rest of us aren't. Can't you remember that?

No. I never could. You must regret having had the invitation sent.
I didn't ask George to invite you.
Then who did?

Jimmy, there are people here I need to speak to. You'll be fine on your own?
Jimmy, there are people here I need to speak to. You'll be fine on your own?
Yes. Perfectly.
Yes. Perfectly.
All right, then. I'll come by tomorrow for breakfast.
You're a lucky man, Mr. Whale. Whatever damage was done by your stroke, it left your motor abilities relatively unimpaired.
Yes, yes, Dr. Payne. But from the neck up? What's my story there?
Yes, yes, Dr. Payne. But from the neck up? What's my story there?
That's what I'm trying to explain.
The central nervous system selects items from a constant storm of sensations. Whatever was killed in your stroke appears to have short-circuited this mechanism. Parts of your brain now seem to be firing at random.
You're saying there's an electrical storm in my head?
You're saying there's an electrical storm in my head?
That's as good a way as any to describe it. I've seen far worse cases. You might even learn to enjoy these walks down memory lane.
That's as good a way as any to describe it. I've seen far worse cases. You might even learn to enjoy these walks down memory lane.
But the rest of it? The killing headaches. The phantom smells. My inability to close my eyes without thinking a hundred things at once. It's all nothing more than bad electricity?

Boris? Do I look a fright?
And you said there'd be some of me left. Nobody's going to know me in this getup.
Nonsense, my dear. You look extraordinary. Today's script. Quick. And a pencil.
Jimmy. How are you?
Elsa?
I saw Una O'Conner a few weeks ago. She said you'd been under the weather.
Oh, nothing out of the ordinary. Growing old.

What's our pesky friend up to now?
Is that Boris? Our little chum appears to be arranging a reunion.
Oh dear.
We'll be in touch, Jimmy.
Good-bye. So nice to see you...
Hanna? Who's the new yardman?
Bone? Boom? Something Bee. I hire him while you were in the hospital. He came cheap.
There is iced tea, Hanna? Cucumber sandwiches?
Yes, Mr. Jimmy. An interview. After so many years. Very exciting.
Yes, Mr. Jimmy. An interview. After so many years. Very exciting.
Don't be daft. It's just a student from the university.
Mr. Kay, sir.
Yes?
Which ones? I bring them all.
Luminal.
You must think I'm terrible, Hanna.
I do not think you anything anymore. Just back from the hospital and already you are chasing after boys.

No. Let me lie here. Thank you.
How are you feeling, Mr. Jimmy? How is your mind today?
My mind's lovely. And yours?
You remember what the doctor tells us.
Yes, yes, yes. I merely invited Mr. Boone in for a glass of tea. We'll have a brief chat and he'll finish the yard.
Yes, yes, yes. I merely invited Mr. Boone in for a glass of tea. We'll have a brief chat and he'll finish the yard.
I am not forgetting your last brief chat.
I am not forgetting your last brief chat.
Just go. We can manage without you.
He looks plenty big. You won't need my help if anything goes flooey.
Go.
Oh, that monster. How could you be working with him?
Don't be silly, Hanna. He's a very proper actor. And the dullest fellow imaginable.
He is not going to kill the old man?
No, Hanna. My heart isn't that black.
She is horrible.
She is beautiful.
You will take them all, Mr. Jimmy?
I'll be fine, Hanna. Thank you.
I'll be fine, Hanna. Thank you.
Good night.
Does the yardman come today?
Of course. This afternoon.
Who was that at the door?
A visitor.
Mr. Boone. He is an interesting friend.
I'd hardly call our yardman a friend.
I'd hardly call our yardman a friend.
No. But someone you can talk to.
Do you miss having someone to talk to, Hanna?
I have my family. Also our Lord Jesus Christ.
I have my family. Also our Lord Jesus Christ.
Of course. How is the old boy these days?
It needs a hat. There was a wide-brimmed cream fedora...
It must be up in your old room. I will look.
That is my daughter. She say she and her husband are coming to town this afternoon. I am sorry, Mr. Jimmy. I will make it short.
I'll be out this afternoon, remember? Your family can visit as long as they like.
I'll be out this afternoon, remember? Your family can visit as long as they like.
No. I do not cook for them. My daughter's no-good husband will not take one bite of our food.
Mr. Whale, this is such an honor. You're one of my favorite all-time directors. I can't believe I'm meeting you.
No. I expect you can't.
No. I expect you can't.
And this is your house. Wow. The house of Frankenstein. I thought you'd live in a spooky old mansion or villa.
And this is your house. Wow. The house of Frankenstein. I thought you'd live in a spooky old mansion or villa.
One likes to live simply.
One likes to live simply.
I know. People's movies aren't their lives.
That's my favorite line in my favorite movie of yours. "Bride of Frankenstein."
Is it now? Hanna? I think we'll take our tea down by the swimming pool.
Will that be good for you, Mr. Kay?
Sure.
Sure.
After you then.
This is the studio where I paint.
Nice. And your lighting and camera angles. You're got to go back to German silent movies to find anything like it.
So, Mr. Kay? What do you want to know?
Everything. Start at the beginning.
Everything. Start at the beginning.
I was born outside London, the only son of a minister who was a master at Harrow. Grandfather was a bishop. Church of...Church of Eng...
Yes?
Your father was a schoolmaster?
Your father was a schoolmaster?
Of course. I attended Eton -- it wouldn't do for a master's son to attend where his father taught. I was to go up to Oxford but the war broke out and I never made it. The Great War, you know. You had a Good War, but we had a great one.
There was one play in particular, a beautiful, grim study of war called "Journey's End". Every experienced director turned it down, so I offered myself, bullying and begging for the job. "Journey's End" made the careers of everyone associated with it. It was only a matter of time until Hollywood beckoned.
How much longer before we get to "Frankenstein"?
How much longer before we get to "Frankenstein"?
Am I correct in assuming, Mr. Kay, that it's not me you're interested in, only my horror pictures?

Oh no, I want to hear everything. You made twenty pictures in all --

Twenty-one. The romantic comedies and dramas were much more to my liking. The horror pictures were trifles. Grand guignol for the masses.
Twenty-one. The romantic comedies and dramas were much more to my liking. The horror pictures were trifles. Grand guignol for the masses.
But it's the horror movies you'll be remembered for.
I am not dead yet, Mr. Kay.
No. I never said you were. Or will be soon.
I have a proposal, Mr. Kay. This mode of questioning is getting old, don't you think?
I don't mind.
I don't mind.
Let's make it more interesting. I will answer any question you ask. But, for each answer, you must remove one article of clothing.
That's funny, Mr. Whale.
It is, isn't it? My life as a game of strip poker. Shall we play?
It is, isn't it? My life as a game of strip poker. Shall we play?
You're serious.
You're serious.
Quite.

Then the rumors are true?

What rumors might those be?

That you were forced to retire because, uh -- a sex scandal.
That you were forced to retire because, uh -- a sex scandal.
A homosexual scandal, you mean? For me to answer a question of that magnitude, you'll have to remove both your shoes and your socks.
Too warm for a sweater, anyway.
You must understand how Hollywood was twenty years ago. Nobody cared a tinker's cuss who slept with whom, so long as you kept it out of the papers. Outside of Hollywood, who knows who George Cukor is, much less what he does with those boys from the malt shops along Santa Monica?
George Cukor? Who made "A Star Is Born"? I never guessed.
Take off your vest and I'll tell you a story.
Don't be shy. There's time to stop before you go too far.
I guess.
Can we talk about the horror movies now?
Certainly, Mr. Kay. Is there anything in particular you want to know?
Certainly, Mr. Kay. Is there anything in particular you want to know?
Will you tell me everything you remember about making "Frankenstein"?
Can that count as one question?
Of course.
Of course.
I can't believe I'm doing this.
Just like going swimming, isn't it?
Maybe you'd like a swim when we're through. I never swim myself, so the pool tends to go to waste.

Okay. "Frankenstein." Tell me everything.

Righto. Let me see.
Universal wanted me for another story, and wanted me so baldly -- I mean badly, not baldly. I was given the pick of stories being developed, and I picked that one.

You think so? That's very kind --
Mr. Whale? Are you all right?
I just need to -- lie down. Studio. Daybed in studio.
Oh my God. What's wrong, Mr. Whale? Is it your heart?
Head. Not heart.
I was going to take a swim.
I'm sorry I spoiled it for you. You should probably go home.
I'm sorry I spoiled it for you. You should probably go home.

Don't think that, Mr. Whale. I love your movies. That's why I wanted you to come to this. So I could see you with your monsters.

My point. Yes. Simple, really. I require the best. I insist on the best. I only engage the best. Your brother. His friends. They came to me. They wanted my paper. He was your brother.

I can come up with the front money. Pay you back...
Were it only that easy. I have obligations. The order needs to be filled...
They gave you only four days?
They gave me two weeks. I wasted most of it with your brother and his crew, who not only lost what pitiful few they managed to boost, but also alerted the heat as to our endeavor, making this even more difficult to achieve ...

Why would I get into that?
I'm not going to get fucked like Gribbs. He's seventy years old and the fucking guy is going to die in prison. I don't need that. I don't care who it is. I'm warning everybody. Gribbs got twenty years just because he said hello to some fuck who was sneaking around selling junk behind his back. That's not going to happen to me. You

But, Paulie, I'm sorry. Believe me. I was fucking crazy. But I'm okay now. I can be trusted. I'm clean now. On my children. Believe me! Two weeks cold turkey waiting for bail got my head together...

You thought I was some fucking jerk?
You thought I was some fucking jerk?
Paulie, I couldn't come to you. I didn't want to put you in this shit. I was ashamed to come to you. I knew I was wrong.
Paulie. You're all I got. I need help.
You treated me like shit.
Here. Take it. Now I gotta turn my back on you.
Thirty-two hundred bucks. That's what he gave me. Thirty-two hundred bucks for a lifetime. It wouldn't have paid for the coffin.
I had a meeting with Tuddy around eleven o'clock and here I am a back-up guy.
Have more coffee. It'll wake you up.
Have more coffee. It'll wake you up.
I couldn't wait to get away. I was ordering the dessert when they were eating dinner. When they were having coffee, I was asking for a check.
I didn't know, I swear. I thought it was next week.
Liar!
Take it easy. We can talk about it.
She's screaming on the street and I mean loud, but she looked good. She had these violet eyes. I remember she's screaming, but mostly I'm looking at her eyes. They were just like Elizabeth Taylor's. That's what everybody said.

Talk? To you? After what you did!
Talk? To you? After what you did!
I thought you were going to stand me up. You looked bored. You didn't say anything. What did you expect. Tommy was all over me. Right?
What're you doing? What about the car?
He watches it for me. It's better than waiting at a garage.
What do you do?
I'm in construction.
I'm in construction.
They don't feel like you're in construction.
Go inside. I'll be right there.
What are you gonna do?

Get inside!
My bag. My bag.
What bag?
What bag?
The bag with the envelopes.
The bag with the envelopes.
Oh that. Don't worry about that. Nobody's gonna steal it.
I Don't know. I don't know if I could live that way. What if, God forbid, you go to prison. Mickey said Jeannie's husband --
Are you nuts? Jeannie's husband went to the can just to get away from her, she's such a pain in the ass. Let me tell you. Nobody goes to jail unless they want to, unless they make themselves get caught. They do stuff with the wrong people. They don't have things organized. You know who goes to jail? Nigger stickup men. That's who. And
I'm gonna need some money.
How much?
I don't care. Something's going on.
That again.
Henry. Wake up.
What's the matter with you? You're crazy.
It's all bullshit. I swear. It's nothing. Whatever you want, we'll do.
The truth was, that no matter how bad I felt, I was still very attracted to him. Why should I give him up to someone else? Why should she win?

Nobody's helping me. Tommy got four years. Marty and Fran are broke. I asked your friend Remo for the money he owed you, and you know what he told me?
It'll be okay.
It'll be okay.
He told me to take the kids to the police station and make the cops put me on welfare.
We've got to help each other.
Even Paulie, since he got out, I hardly see him.
Even Paulie, since he got out, I hardly see him.
It's only you and me. That's what happens when you go away. We're on our own. Forget everybody. Forget Paulie. As long as he's on parole he doesn't want anybody doing anything.

Yes, you can. I've got it set up. We'll be fine. All I need is for you to keep bringing the stuff. I've got a guy in here from Pittsburgh who'll move it for me. Believe me, in a month we'll be fine. We won't need anybody.

At least Jimmy and Mickey want to help. I talk to Mickey every day. That's more than I can say for the rest.
Paul will calm down. You'll see.
I told Jimmy the cops took our cars and froze our bank accounts and he offered to get me some money. Be wants to know what's happening. You gotta meet him.
Fuck Jimmy and the money. Didn't I tell you I gotta get out of here first. I gotta straighten every- thing out with Paulie or I'm dead.
Then you're safer in here.
Safe? Here? They'll kill me here. They're all afraid I'm gonna rat them out. People are already looking to walk away from me. I'm dead in here. You gotta get me out.
Safe? Here? They'll kill me here. They're all afraid I'm gonna rat them out. People are already looking to walk away from me. I'm dead in here. You gotta get me out.
Who's gonna do that?

Jimmy was one of the most feared gays in the city. He was first locked up at eleven and was doing hits for mob bosses when he was sixteen. Hits never bothered him. It was business. But what he really loved to do was steal. I mean, he actually enjoyed it. Jimmy was the kind of guy who rooted for the bad guys in
You got money for your bullshit television, don't you? I gotta watch you swimming back and forth on TV all night long, don't I? You got money for that, but you don't have my money?

Jimmy and I could never be made, because we bad Irish blood. It didn't even matter that my mother was Sicilian. To become a member of a crew, you've got to be one hundred percent Italian So that they can trace all your relatives back to the old country.
What fucking good are these things? They don't fit. What do I need this for? I'm not paying for this shit.
Right away I knew he didn't want them. I knew I was going to get stuck for the money. I only bought the damn guns because he wanted them. And now, he didn't want them. I didn't say a thing. Jimmy was so pissed he didn't even say goodbye.
I can't eat, just get me some coffee.
He was jumpy. He hadn't touched a thing. In the old days, Jimmy would have ordered doubles and eaten it all. On the surface, of course, everything was supposed to be fine. We were supposed to be discussing my case, just like we always would, but I had a feeling Jimmy was trying to sense whether I was going to rat him out to

Look, you're my best friend, so don't take this the wrong way, but in 20 years, if you're livin' next door to me, comin' over watchin' the fuckin' Patriots' games and still workin' construction, I'll fuckin' kill you. And that's not a threat, that's a fact. I'll fuckin' kill you.

Why is it always this? I owe it to myself? What if I don't want to?
Why is it always this? I owe it to myself? What if I don't want to?
Fuck you. You owe it to me. Tomorrow I'm gonna wake up and I'll be fifty and I'll still be doin' this. And that's all right 'cause I'm gonna make a run at it. But you, you're sittin' on a winning lottery ticket and you're too much of a pussy to cash it in. And that's bullshit 'cause I'd do anything to have what

You don't know that.
You don't know that.
Let me tell you what I do know. Every day I come by to pick you up, and we go out drinkin' or whatever and we have a few laughs. But you know what the best part of my day is? The ten seconds before I knock on the door 'cause I let myself think I might get there, and you'd be gone. I'd
You and Morgan throw?
No, I had to talk him down.
No, I had to talk him down.
Why didn't you yoke him?
Why didn't you yoke him?
Little Morgan's got a lot a scrap, dude. I'd rather fight a big kid, they never fight, everyone's scared of 'em. You know how many people try to whip Morgan's ass every week? Fuckin' kid won't back down.
You're kiddin' me.
Yeah, I figured now that you got your big job over in Cambridge, you needed some way to get over there and I knew I wasn't gonna drive you every day...
Okay.
So, you ladies ah, go to school here?
What class?
Ah, history I think.
Ah, history I think.
Oh...
Oh...
Yah, it's not a bad school...
I'm glad you came by, changed my opinion of Harvard people.
See ya' Chuckie. I had fun.
Yeah, not tonight. Not any other night. He knows, once you see that shit-hole he's gettin' dropped like a bad habit.
I wanted to meet your brothers...
Hi.
How you doin'?
How you doin'?
Good.
How'd you know where to find me?
You were the only Sullivan in the phone book.
Oh, right.
This is your house, right?
I guess so.
What? No. This is my mother's house. I don't live with my mother. I just stop by, help out. I'm good like that.

She'll live. If she starts yelling again I might have to run in real quick and beat her with the stick again but...

Let's take a walk. EXT. CHUCKIE'S STREET -- DAY
See, now this doesn't feel right. When I made the decision to come over here it felt right. I had all these rationalizations... I just don't understand why Will never tells me anything, he won't let me get close to him, he tells me these weird lies--
You caught that, huh?
You caught that, huh?
I just wanted to find out what was going on...But now that I'm here it seems strange, doesn't it?
I just wanted to find out what was going on...But now that I'm here it seems strange, doesn't it?
Well, I don't have no trousers on...
I don't care what his family's like or if he doesn't have any brothers, but he doesn't have to lie to me.
I really don't know what to say. Look, I lie to women all the time. That's just my way. Last week Morgan brought these girls down from Roslindale. I told them I was a cosmonaut. They believed me. But Will's not usually like that--
Is that true?
Yeah, it is.
--That isn't funny--
--and he's like "shit! Motherfucker!" And he looks in his rearview and sees this cat-- I'm sorry--
Jesus.
And all the time he's apologizin' to the cat, goin' "I'm sorry." BANG, "I'm sorry." BANG!
WILL!
And so they go around to the front of his truck...and there's another cat on the grille.
Yah, that is a nice ass.
You could put a pool in that backyard.
Fuck this, let's get something to eat...
What Morgan, you're not gonna go talk to her?
What Morgan, you're not gonna go talk to her?
Fuck her.
Morgan, I'm not goin' to "Kelly's Roast Beef" just cause you like the take-out girl. It's fifteen minutes out of our way. MORGAN What else we gonna do we can't spare fifteen minutes?
All right Morgan, fine. I'll tell you why we're not going to "Kelly's." It's because the take-out bitch is a fuckin' idiot. I'm sorry you like her but she's dumb as a post and she has never got our order right, never once.

She's not stupid.
Would you shut the fuck up! I know what you ordered, I was there!
So why don't you give me my sandwhich?
So why don't you give me my sandwhich?
What do you mean "your sandwhich?" I bought it.
What do you mean "your sandwhich?" I bought it.
Yah, all right...
Yah, all right...
How much money you got?
How much money you got?
I told you, I just got change.
I told you, I just got change.
Well give me your fuckin' change and we'll put your fuckin' sandwhich on lay-away.
Well give me your fuckin' change and we'll put your fuckin' sandwhich on lay-away.
Why you gotta be an asshole Chuckie?
Why you gotta be an asshole Chuckie?
I think you should establish a good line of credit.
Did she get my Double Burger?
NO SHE DIDN'T GET YOUR DOUBLE BURGER!! IT'S ALL FUCKIN' FLYIN' FISH FILET!!
Come on, Will...
Shut up.
Shut up.
No, why didn't you fight him at the park if you wanted to? I'm not goin' now, I'm eatin' my snack. WILL So don't go.
Morgan, Let's go.
I'm serious Chuckie, I ain't goin'.
You got fired from pushing a broom, you little bitch.
Yah, that was different. Management was restructurin'--
My uncle can probably get you on my demo team.
What the fuck? I just asked you for a job yesterday!
What the fuck? I just asked you for a job yesterday!
I told you "no" yesterday!
Some other guy?
Yeah, he was probably drunker than my Uncle, who fuckin' knows? So the cop goes "Stay here" And he goes runnin' down the highway to deal with the other crash. So, my Uncle Marty's standin' on the side of the road for a little while, and he's so fuckin' lit, that he forgets what he's waitin' for. So he goes, "Fuck it." He gets

Holy shit.
Holy shit.
So in the morning, there's a knock on the door it's the Statie. So my Uncle's like, "Is there a problem?" And the Statie's like "I pulled you over and you took off." And my Uncle's like "I never seen you before in my life, I been home all night with my kids." And Statie's like "Let me get in your garage!" So he's
