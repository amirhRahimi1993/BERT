If you ask me, the fucker got what he deserved. I'm glad he's dead.
That's a terrible thing to say. Frida goes back to scrubbing the floor.

Okay, let's say that this is PMS- related. You think those male cops are going to understand that? You'll either be locked up for murder or locked up in the looney bin. We have to keep this hidden until we figure it out ourselves.
At least I finally saw the reason you couldn't get over Mark.
You should have seen it erect.
You expecting someone?
No.
No.
Ignore it.
Fuck it's the cops. Peter saw me, now I have to let him in.
Tell them you'll meet them outside.
What the fuck are we going to do?
Hide him.
Peter knows something.
Well if he does, he didn't give you away. He must really like you.
I think I just got my period.
Does that mean this whole thing is over?
Does that mean this whole thing is over?
Probably for three weeks or so anyway. I'm not sure -- I don't get how it works.

So are you. Look, go about your life. Act like nothing's wrong. We'll get to the bottom of this.
Symptoms include loss of emotional control, compulsive behavior, cravings, crying spells...
Peter keeps asking me out.
Peter keeps asking me out.
Maybe you should go out with him. If you keep avoiding him he'll get suspicious. Besides, what better way to not get busted than to date the cop who's investigating you.

The thing is, I really like him. I finally meet a guy I really like and I'm a fuckin' werewolf.
The thing is, I really like him. I finally meet a guy I really like and I'm a fuckin' werewolf.
We don't know you're a werewolf. It might never happen again. You have to get on with your life.
"Paranoia, insecurity, depression, changes in vision, feelings of losing control; belief that you have a mental problem..." Nothing about turning into a werewolf.
Check out what I found.
This is from a scientist in France, Madame Sconce. "The original werewolves were females. They became werewolves on the lunar cycle because it corresponded to the woman's cycle. My suspicion is that the only cure is true love."
Great so all I have to do is fall in love? Like I haven't tried that for the past 24 years.

"The female-cycle werewolf will only kill men and never kills someone she truly loves." See I knew you never loved Mark.

Who is this Madame Sconce? Let's find her and talk to her.

She died at age 34 in the 1800's. They thought she was crazy. She was banished from her town. Seems her husband shot her.

You scared the shit out of me. I thought you were killing yourself.

I think George knows.
About Mark? Carlton?

About Benito.

Did I kill a guy named Benito?
Did I kill a guy named Benito?
No, he's the guy I'm having an affair with.
I thought you and George were getting married.
We were -- I was just so tempted... It was sort of a test. I think after sleeping with Benito I know I want to be with George. But now George knows about Benito and he doesn't want to be with me!

Sorry -- I shouldn't go on about myself at a time like this. Are you sure you're going to be okay?
Sorry -- I shouldn't go on about myself at a time like this. Are you sure you're going to be okay?
Yes, just check on me once a day for the next three days. Then the PMS should be over.
Hello?
Frida? You okay?

Never been better. Peter spent the night. I must really love him. He's still alive.

Oh, a D-Girl. You know... I have a really great idea for a screenplay.
You're kidding, really?
No, I'm serious. How about we have dinner and I tell you about it?
You hungry?
Starving.
Man I'm starving too, I think I'll go for the Surf and Turf.
I'm not really hungry after all.
I'm not really hungry after all.
You said you're starving. Come on, I can't stand a woman who won't eat.
So there I was, hanging from the edge of a bridge, when my mom said, "Son, you got into Harvard!" It took three of them to pull me back! Frida keeps eating.
Well, whattdaya think?
Well, whattdaya think?
That's great. Highly original.
I'd really feel more comfortable paying for my half of the dinner.
Hey, how about a little nightcap?
I'm really tired.
Come on, didn't all that steak make you thirsty?

What, you got a date or somethin'?
Since when do you care?
You look different. I mean you look good.
You never say that.

Frida, you know you're it for me.

Hey wait, I paid three bucks for that burger. You owe me...
You haven't even paid me back the thousand bucks you owe me!
You haven't even paid me back the thousand bucks you owe me!
I'm working on it...
Where'd you get the bike?
I'm kinda borrowing it. Who's this, Mr. Date-Guy?
Frida? I hear you talking. I know you're in there. Let me in.
It's Mark.
It's a matter of life and death.
This really isn't a good time.
This really isn't a good time.
Come on Frida, I'm not kidding. I'm totally fucked. Let me in.
I did something stupid. I had a courier job -- picking up a package from the airport. It turned out to be money -- so I kind of borrowed it to pay my rent and now these dudes are after me.
So pay them back and apologize.

These guys aren't the kind that'll take an apology. They're the kind that'll break my thumbs.

Yeah?
Wow.

How about a "Man in Jeopardy" story?
Did you change your hair?

A little.
I can't read any more crap. These women are all victims.
Yes, that's what we're looking for.
Yes, that's what we're looking for.
I think we should do something with strong female characters...

I'll make a note of that. Put the coverage on my desk.
Mr. Grant. Did you read that script I was talking about?
Uh... yes. Not for us. No woman in jeopardy. Find me Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman. Find me a true story about a crazed killer stalking beautiful women.
Uh... yes. Not for us. No woman in jeopardy. Find me Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman. Find me a true story about a crazed killer stalking beautiful women.
No.

Very well then. Is that all?
When's the last time you saw him?
We... he walked me home and... we said goodnight. Um, he kissed me goodnight and that was it.
I wish I could help but last I saw Gregory was outside my front door.
Okay, if you think of anything else, please give us a call.
You busted me.
Are you following me?
Are you following me?
No... no... this is embarrassing. I was returning your pillowcase... and I saw you cross the street... and I sort of started following you. I just find you really intriguing. I don't know why.
No... no... this is embarrassing. I was returning your pillowcase... and I saw you cross the street... and I sort of started following you. I just find you really intriguing. I don't know why.
Intriguing?
I gotta get going. Peter gets the pillowcase out of his bag.
At least let me give you this back. I washed it.
Being a cop has such a warm effect on people.
That's my ex. He's an asshole. In case you couldn't tell. I think he's been following me.

There's a lot of that going around.
You wanna get some coffee?
I'm trying to stay away from caffeine.

Some decaf then? That was stupid. Obviously you said you were staying away from caffeine as a nice way of blowing me off.

No really, I love knowing what people read.

My mom used to get PMS too.
Used to? Did it stop finally?
Used to? Did it stop finally?
No, she died when I was twelve.
No, she died when I was twelve.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I've had time to get over it. She was killed by wolves they think.
I've had time to get over it. She was killed by wolves they think.
Oh my god, by wolves?
We lived in northern Minnesota. She went for a walk one night and they never found her body -- just her torn apart clothes with her blood and wolf blood on them. Then the town rounded up bunch of hunters and shot all the wolves in the area.
I'm so sorry Peter. Gee, that sure puts my problems in perspective.
I'm so sorry Peter. Gee, that sure puts my problems in perspective.
The weird thing is I've had an odd, morbid fascination with wolves ever since.
I've read scripts about detectives, but never met one. Must be wild.
Sometimes it's frustrating. Like this Gregory Jameson case. We don't even know what killed him. I'm putting together little details to see if we're missing something.

Yeah but a guy hung like a horse would need briefs to keep things in line.
How about you? Briefs or boxers?
Briefs.
Briefs.
Cool. I don't get guys who wear boxers. My ex wore boxers. I never got how he could wear khakis and not have his boxers bunch up.
Cool. I don't get guys who wear boxers. My ex wore boxers. I never got how he could wear khakis and not have his boxers bunch up.
Me neither. That's why I wear briefs... So why did you and... Mark break up?
Me neither. That's why I wear briefs... So why did you and... Mark break up?
He's bad news. He cheated on me, he insults me. Now suddenly he gets jealous if I have a date.
I really gotta get going.
Thanks for the walk. Maybe we could... get a bite sometime?
Thanks for the walk. Maybe we could... get a bite sometime?
Yeah. Maybe.
Yeah. Maybe.
Goodnight.

What are those?
Silver bullets. A collectors item. These are very valuable. They were melted down from a crucifix.

What are they for?
What are they for?
Oh just my wolf paraphernalia. Some people collect beanie babies... I collect silver bullets.
I'm a cop -- I notice everything. That drawer's ajar, that picture's been moved about an inch, the closet wasn't closed when I left...
Okay, you busted me.
What's wrong?
Oh, nothing's wrong. Just... well don't you have your period?
Oh, nothing's wrong. Just... well don't you have your period?
My period? No.
I mean we can still... whatever... Maybe I should get a towel?
No. No, I'm fine. Maybe I should go. I mean... I don't want our first time to be like this.
No. No, I'm fine. Maybe I should go. I mean... I don't want our first time to be like this.
Frida, wait. Don't go. We can just sleep. I just want to wake up with you.
Oh my god, you scared the shit out of me. You following me again?
No. I was doing my laundry.
No. I was doing my laundry.
I'm sorry -- I'm on edge today.
Was there anything in that washer?
No. Nope, nothing in it.
You sure? It's my favorite shirt, mind if I check?
NO! I... I checked when I put my stuff in. I always look through the washer first.
Everything okay?
A man killed in Central Park.
Uh.... hi!
Frida, can we come in? We need to talk to you. It's important.
Frida, can we come in? We need to talk to you. It's important.
Uh... the buzzer's broken. I'll be down in a second.
You had a date with Carlton?
It wasn't a date. Jennifer invited me along to dinner with them.
No, no... But Mark -- a jealous boyfriend gone mad. Maybe he kills men you date.
Mark wouldn't hurt a fly.
But you said the bodies were ripped to pieces?
Still haven't figured out how he or anyone else pulled that off. Never seen anything like it.
No, why?
He was ripped to shreds also. In his apartment.
Frida. I was looking for you. You changing jobs?
Yeah sort of. Where's Lloyd?
Yeah sort of. Where's Lloyd?
I need to talk to you. About us. Frida... I... Can I carry your box?

Except Mark of course.
What's that supposed to mean?

No, but thanks for the warning.
No, but thanks for the warning.
Speaking of Mark -- we've tried to track him down and there's no sight of him. Vanished into thin air. I got a hunch he fled the country.

Interesting possibility.
That's it? Hell my mom chased my dad around with a knife when she had it. She made us call her a different name. She'd say, "You're talking to Betty now" and we'd leave the house for a few days.
This is a lot worse than "Betty."
This is a lot worse than "Betty."
You can't mean that. I'm sure your bark is worse than your bite.
You can't mean that. I'm sure your bark is worse than your bite.
No, my bite's a lot worse.
Is it that funny?
No, it's just... no one's ever said that. And I thought if someone did ever say it, I'd have to say it first and then they'd sort of say "I love you too" cause they felt they had to after I'd said it.

I loaned him to Jennifer. George moved out and she was lonely...
Your breasts feel larger.
They do? Oh no...
They do? Oh no...
No, it's a good thing. I like it. Everything about you is great. I like how you don't shave your legs. Women are so much sexier when they're natural.
I did shave... Do I seem hairy? Peter laughs.
No. But I don't mind hairy. Are you okay?
Hello?
Frida? You okay? Look, I think I know what happened to Mark. I want to help. I'm coming over.
Frida? You okay? Look, I think I know what happened to Mark. I want to help. I'm coming over.
NO! Don't come over. Peter... I... I don't want to see you anymore. Ever.
NO! Don't come over. Peter... I... I don't want to see you anymore. Ever.
What? Is there someone else?
Yes, sort of. I mean no, not really.
Yes or no? Frida, can't you just be honest with me?
You at least owe me the truth.
You want the truth? Remember I tried to tell you something the other day?
You want the truth? Remember I tried to tell you something the other day?
Yes, your PMS. Frida I can deal with that.
Yes, your PMS. Frida I can deal with that.
No you can't. It... it gets so bad that I become a werewolf.
If you don't like me, just say so. You don't have to make up some bullshit like you're a werewolf.
I knew you wouldn't believe me! Just go away. Go very far away!
Go away. I might hurt you.
I'm not afraid. Frida! I love you.
I'm not afraid. Frida! I love you.
Peter I love you too but...

I don't think you'll hurt me.
How do you know?
I don't think you would. No matter what form you take.

I can't take that chance... I couldn't live with myself if I did anything to you.
I can't take that chance... I couldn't live with myself if I did anything to you.
I have the silver bullets in case I need to protect myself. Does that make you feel better?
Be careful!
Can't you bite me and then I'll be like you?
Can't you bite me and then I'll be like you?
No. It doesn't work that way. Men can't get PMS. Unfortunately.
No. It doesn't work that way. Men can't get PMS. Unfortunately.
I'm staying here with you tonight. There's no getting rid of me.
I knew you wouldn't kill me.

I know. The important thing is that it stop.
I'm going to take a shower.
Okay.
Here's a towel.
Thanks.
That I'm a doormat of course. The shrink makes more notes.
Oh, I see... interesting theory.
I think I'm a werewolf.
Let's explore this. What makes you feel you're a werewolf?
I ate a guy last night.
And how did you feel when you ate this guy?
And how did you feel when you ate this guy?
I don't know. I don't remember doing it.
Dreams about killing usually signify feelings of guilt. You had sex last night and you feel guilty.
We didn't have sex.
We didn't have sex.
You say you killed a man and don't remember it. Couldn't you have had sex and not remember it? It's sexual. Why did you choose "eating him" as the method of killing?
You say you killed a man and don't remember it. Couldn't you have had sex and not remember it? It's sexual. Why did you choose "eating him" as the method of killing?
Cause I'm a fucking werewolf!!
Cause I'm a fucking werewolf!!
You use the word "fucking." You're sexualizing things. Stop berating yourself. It's okay to have sex.
It's about Gregory Jameson. He's dead.
Oh my god, what happened?
Yes... I... we had dinner.
Did he come home with you? Did you go to his apartment?
Did he come home with you? Did you go to his apartment?
No, it was our first date.
No, it was our first date.
Looks like it was your only date. Unless you go to his funeral.
A kiss? Did you have sex with him?
No, I said it was our first date.
We can get a warrant if you like.
No, take it.
You heard about Carlton Fraser?
Yes, Jennifer told me. What does that have to do with me?
Seems you were the last to see Carlton alive. And the last to see Gregory alive.
What makes you think I was the last one?
No. We left the restaurant, and... and I felt sick... so... so I took a cab home. Alone.
You got a dog?
You got a dog?
No, I have a cat.
No, I have a cat.
How big?
No he's not. He's a courier. He picks up packages from the airport.
Packages of money.
So I asked the bartender what "coyote ugly" meant. It's like the "bagger" system. You know, a two- bagger -- someone so ugly that you need two bags -- one bag to put on their head and another one in case it blows off. Or a three-bagger...
Two bags for them, and one bag for your head in case her two fall off.
He was saying that when women are close friends they get their periods at the same time.
Yeah and when we're mad at each other we're out of sync. It only works if you're on good terms.
Come on, I've been working with Frida. Carlton won't even recognize her now. She's really coming out of her shell.
She's just so... pathetic.
She's just so... pathetic.
She's just insecure. Once you get to know her she's fabulous.
She's just insecure. Once you get to know her she's fabulous.
She'll talk about PMS and stare at her salad.
I wonder how Frida and Carlton are getting along?
Carlton insisted on leaving with her. Maybe he got lucky.
Carlton insisted on leaving with her. Maybe he got lucky.
So now being with Frida is lucky? I thought you said she was a flake.
It's for you. Frida.
Tell her I'm eating.
I'm supposed to put up with a fuckin' cat I'm allergic to cause your friend's got PMS?
It's so bad she becomes a werewolf.
It's so bad she becomes a werewolf.
You have some weird friends. What does her thinking she's a werewolf have to do with us having the cat?
You have some weird friends. What does her thinking she's a werewolf have to do with us having the cat?
Don't be stupid George. Obviously if she's a werewolf, she can't be around a cat. She might eat it and besides, cats are afraid of wolves.
Oh great. What the fuck am I supposed to do?
Take some allergy medicine.
Take some allergy medicine.
You can't believe this bullshit.
You can't believe this bullshit.
She's my best friend. I gotta be there for her -- no matter how crazy it sounds. I've been in some bad relationships and she's been there for me. She's lonely. If pretending she's a werewolf helps, then more power to her.
Jesus Christ she got her period. Relax guys. It happens.
Yeah, sorry. Uh... Gregory's roommate told us you were out with him last night.
How the hell is that your business?
We're just trying to figure out what happened.
You want her sheets?
We can just take this pillowcase.
I was thinking about becoming a cop myself. Do you take a test or something or just sign up?
Why would you want to be a cop?
Why would you want to be a cop?
I don't know, I guess the outfits are cool. And I want a big gun.
See he was cheating from the get go.
He's been running money for the Mafia.
Nah, I don't wanna break up with Wanda, I just wanna see Carmen too.
Man, you're livin' dangerously. Let me ask you somethin', you always have to get women drunk before they'll sleep with you?

You're some catch Lloyd.
You're some catch Lloyd.
Hey, you hear about the chick that came in today? Said some chick bit her at Victoria's Secret. Bitches are outta control these days.
He was found a few blocks away.
Torn apart. Limb from limb. A bloody gruesome mess.
I didn't trust her. All that blood on the sheets. She may look sweet, but she could be a wolf in sheep's clothing. Something's weird.
That dude was torn limb from limb. No way a woman like that could have done it. You never seen blood on a chick's sheets from her period?
That dude was torn limb from limb. No way a woman like that could have done it. You never seen blood on a chick's sheets from her period?
Hell no, I'm not into that shit. The sight of blood makes me sick.
Hell no, I'm not into that shit. The sight of blood makes me sick.
Oh, so you decide to be a cop? Seriously? You don't have sex with a woman cause she's on the rag?
Oh, so you decide to be a cop? Seriously? You don't have sex with a woman cause she's on the rag?
No man. Blood is not a turn on. You sure let that Frida off the hook. You weren't even going to take the sheets. If I didn't know better, I'd think you liked her.
No man. Blood is not a turn on. You sure let that Frida off the hook. You weren't even going to take the sheets. If I didn't know better, I'd think you liked her.
I can tell she's not a killer. You just don't like her cause you have a hang up about menstruation.
I can tell she's not a killer. You just don't like her cause you have a hang up about menstruation.
Nah, man, I'm just saying, you should never date a woman who was the last one to see a guy alive.
Frida's sheets checked out fine. It was just her own blood. From her... you know.
I told you she was innocent.
I told you she was innocent.
Hey, there was a lot of blood.

She was never a suspect Lloyd. Some animal must have done this.
She was never a suspect Lloyd. Some animal must have done this.
I checked all the zoos. No missing animals. You think a pitbull?
Maybe. What about all those hairs they found on his body?
Waiting for DNA tests. He was hairier than Madonna in Penthouse.

Madonna's in Penthouse?

Back in the '80's. You didn't see the pictures? They were from before she got famous. She was hairy as hell. Her pits, her bush.

Hairy women are kind of sexy. Women in their natural state.
What?
And you think I'm sick?
He was found nearly ripped to shreds in Central Park.
And he was missing an arm.
I still don't get when you gave her back the pillowcase.
We only live a few blocks apart.

This is more than fishy, this chick dates a dude and he winds up dead.
This is more than fishy, this chick dates a dude and he winds up dead.
Okay Lloyd, you tell me how she killed them.
She's got a hidden pitbull. Maybe she hired someone to kill them.
She's not a suspect. What is her motive? There's nothing, NOTHING connecting her to either crime except that she dated both guys.

Sounds like you got a conflict of interest.

You take the cake Lloyd. Come on, she's not here. Let's check out her psycho ex.
Nah, East Village poseur was grosser than the dude in the park.
The park dude was missing an arm.
The park dude was missing an arm.
Poseur was missing a chunk of his neck. And his eyes were open. That always bugs me out. Do me a favor, if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, remind me to close my fuckin' eyes.

Deal. And if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, shoot him.

Yeah okay. I still say Frida's involved. She's the last one to see two dudes alive...
Yeah okay. I still say Frida's involved. She's the last one to see two dudes alive...
She wasn't the last one to see them alive. Whoever killed them was.
He means the last that we know of.
This one walk you home too?
Seems he's stolen money from them. He's desperate and our only lead.
One of our only leads... You had dates with both men right before they were killed.
Spencer's the key here. Frida is in no way associated with him. And her blood hasn't matched with any of the killings.
It's a bit farfetched that Mark would rip guys to shreds just outta jealousy. This makes no sense.
It's a bit farfetched that Mark would rip guys to shreds just outta jealousy. This makes no sense.
It's like some fucking monster dropped out of the sky and killed these dudes.
It's like some fucking monster dropped out of the sky and killed these dudes.
Like a vampire or some shit?
You think mafia hit?
Hard to tell. Looks like he's been cleaned up and he's decomposing as we speak. This case gets weirder by the minute.

It has to be Frida. This makes three guys ripped apart who are tied to her ass.

Okay Lloyd. First, no way does Frida have the physical strength to tear a guy to shreds. Second, why would she be so obvious and let it be known she was the last one to see these guys? Third, she's the one in danger. She's a woman in jeopardy and you're layin' a murder rap on her. Fourth, I look in her eyes and

And fifth, you're dating her.
What are you talking about?
I know. I followed you. To the zoo, to her house, to your house...
I know. I followed you. To the zoo, to her house, to your house...
What the fuck are you following me for? I'm not a suspect here.
What the fuck are you following me for? I'm not a suspect here.
Which brings up an interesting point. I wasn't following you. I was following the suspect. And you just happened to be there...
My girlfriend's predicting another murder in the next few days.
What makes her think that?
What makes her think that?
She says she's on the rag every time I get called in to investigate a murder.
So... they're on some cycle. The murders... Gregory... then 28 days later... Carlton.
And that was 28 days ago today.
And that was 28 days ago today.
Did we get those DNA tests back?

Just this morning. Animal hairs were found all over the victims.
Just this morning. Animal hairs were found all over the victims.
What kind of animal?
What kind of animal?
Can't figure out the species. Similar to a wolf. They're jokin' at the lab that a werewolf probably killed him. Ain't that the stupidest thing you ever heard?
I need something to keep me awake.
Looks like you need a haircut to me.
Looks like you need a haircut to me.
Thanks. Just some pills.
Thanks. Just some pills.
Only two bucks. Shave as well...
Sell maps?
What of?
What of?
The city. I need to get to the ocean.
The city. I need to get to the ocean.
Nope. No maps. Ocean, huh? On vacation?
Mnunn. Cold lately. That night, couple weeks ago. That was <u>real</u> cold. Remember that?
Not really...
Not really...
Yeah, Iím like that. Senility says the wife. But she sure canít complain. Heh. The erector set still works good. And this ainít no fucking rug! Gíhead. Feel it! All mine!
How long have you been here?
Maybe ten minutes... Thatís strange.
Maybe ten minutes... Thatís strange.
Spinning backwards?
What's he doing here?
Says he is the man's doctor... You know...
Says he is the man's doctor... You know...
I <u>know</u> it's his doctor... I need the file on.. Daniel Paul Schreber M.D.
All the same entry wounds. It's definitely him. She lives... lived here. A prostitute.
The other one?
The other one?
His wife.
His wife.
Jesus. Small world. Where's the photographer?
Jesus. Small world. Where's the photographer?
No one available.
They don't speak English...
How will we interrogate them?
How will we interrogate them?
Well, sir... I don't know exactly.
Police. Nobody move.
He tried to kill me!
He tried to kill me!
Shut up! Everybody stay calm...
Doctor! What brings you here?
Just visiting my patient.
Just visiting my patient.
Really? And how is his state of mind?
Really? And how is his state of mind?
He's seriously disturbed...
You seem a little edgy. Everything okay?
Yes, of course. Everything's fine...
To tell you the truth, I'm glad we've run into each other like this. Maybe you can help me tidy some loose ends.
Loose ends?
I met a friend of yours the other night, doctor. Tall fellow. No hair. Rather pale skin...
I don't know what you're talking about.
I don't know what you're talking about.
That's surprising. He was leaving your office at the time...
That's surprising. He was leaving your office at the time...
You are mistaken.
Please, they'll kill me...
I think it's time you introduced us to your little friends.
In there.
Just like that?
What is this place?
You wouldn't believe me if I told you, Inspector. Have patience - you'll see for yourself.
Was that for real down there?
I'm afraid so.
Good evening, sir.
Yes. This way.
Why are you wearing that thing on your face?
Germs, sir. These places are full of them.
Germs, sir. These places are full of them.
I see. One thingís for sure, heís ambitious. Youíll be a busy man from now on.
What about Thompson, sir? Wasnít this his case?
Thompson suffered a kind of severe delusion or some damn thing. Anyway he isnít with us any longer. The case is yours. Go through his files. Take what you need. By the way, howís your mother?
Thompson suffered a kind of severe delusion or some damn thing. Anyway he isnít with us any longer. The case is yours. Go through his files. Take what you need. By the way, howís your mother?
Sheís getting better, thanks. She...
Why do you want to speak to him?
A hunch. He might be able to...
Itís extremely important to my investigation...
Iíll be the judge of that. Anything else?
Iíll be the judge of that. Anything else?
Actually, I was wondering, sir, if you could let me have a few uniforms, to follow up for me...
Lost something?
What makes you think that! If you would learn to concentrate on facts, not get so side-tracked - you might get things done faster, Bumstead...
Yes. That's right. He's ill - he needs expert help.
I see...
Yes, sir. I'm sorry... But I don't understand how it was possible. The only window was twenty feet up a vertical wall, he was cuffed...
How could you have been so stupid?
Bumstead, you're starting to annoy me. This case is very important to me. Just a little warning: I've got my eye on you inspector, remember that.
Yes, sir.
Dammit!
Sorry, sir.
Sorry, sir.
Donít ever sneak up on me like that! Who are you?
Donít ever sneak up on me like that! Who are you?
Patricia Crenshaw.
Iím your new assistant.
I didnít requisition a secretary.
I didnít requisition a secretary.
The Chief-Inspector thought you might need a hand.
Iíve taken the liberty and had Inspector Thompsonís office searched, as I believe you instructed. All clear now, sir. They found several more traps and things were filed under pretty strange categories... Poor man.
Good.
Good.
You wonít regret this, sir.
You wonít regret this, sir.
Fine.
You typed this report?
Yes, sir. Anything wrong?
Yes, sir. Anything wrong?
Wrong? Look at this!
It seems fine.
<u>Fine</u>? Look here!
How can I submit this?
Iím sorry...
Iím sorry...
Do you wash your hands before you type things?
Do you wash your hands before you type things?
Why, yes.
Why, yes.
Well be more careful, please.
Who is it?
Won't say. Says he must talk to you.
Won't say. Says he must talk to you.
Put it through...
I need everything on the Jonathan White case.
Yes, sir. <u>Everything</u>?
Yes, sir. <u>Everything</u>?
All the important stuff. Wrap it up for me.
Where are we going?
Shut-up.
Why give yourself up?
I - ah - couldn't think of anything else to do. I thought maybe you know something... I'm scared.
I - ah - couldn't think of anything else to do. I thought maybe you know something... I'm scared.
That was a pretty good escape act at the station. How did you do that?
That was a pretty good escape act at the station. How did you do that?
I woke up in a subway. I don't know how I got there.
People... after me.
Who?
Who?
I don't know who they are.
I don't know who they are.
Why are they after you?
Why are they after you?
Don't know that either.
Don't know that either.
Don't know much, do you?
They didn't have faces.
What?
What?
That's right. Just seamless flesh across the front of their heads. No mistake. I just hadn't remembered it that way. Up until then they had been normal little girls in my memory. That's not all. Once I started examining them, all sorts of things about my life, had... inconsistencies. It was like a game. I would think about a person or a place, or
Go on.
Well. The only thing I've been certain of, all this time, is that I need to get to the ocean. The point is no one seems to know how to get there.
Well. The only thing I've been certain of, all this time, is that I need to get to the ocean. The point is no one seems to know how to get there.
Why, that's ridiculous. You just...
Where do you think this goes?
It sure isn't the fun-fair.
What now?
This ocean business... I know where I can find a map. I need to go back to the station. Where will you be?
Can't let you in... sorry.
I'm on the serial killer case, need to talk.
I'm on the serial killer case, need to talk.
Not that. Anything else.
They've taken my mind, my memories...
What? Who has?
What? Who has?
Is that your idea of a joke? I don't remember... Take my advice, Bumstead. Get off this case. Now.
Is that your idea of a joke? I don't remember... Take my advice, Bumstead. Get off this case. Now.
What is going on?
Jesus! We have to get you to a doctor...
No... No doctor...
But... How long has this been happening?
A few days... a few weeks - dunno, I can't remember. Worse thing is, I never know if it will change back again... Now, please leave me alone.
Look! This is a good one!
What is that door?
What is that door?
Which one?
Which one?
There. Behind the cabinet. Where does it go?
Such a joker! Like your father.
No. Have a look.
You see it?
Yes.
Yes.
Where does it lead?
Where does it lead?
It must be a closet or something.
A fanciful idea, Mister White.
Everyone has a job - a function. Each one teaches you more about your invention. I'm what is called a <u>murderer</u>.
A book of delusions. Anything else?
But I...
But I...
I see. The verdict, yes...
I see. The verdict, yes...
Wait, this isn't fair...
I didn't realise...
Shut up, freak! Monster! You are insignificant.
No. I, ah...
You seem restless.
Someoneís after me.
Then we must call the police.
Then we must call the police.
No. I mean... that isnít necessary.
I see. Then who is after you? What sins have you committed?
Just let me sit here for a moment? Iíll go soon, and stop bothering you.
Donít kill me!
Shut up!
Shut up!
Please...
You remember nothing? Who you are? What you've done?
You know something about me?
You know something about me?
Ah, that would be cheating, wouldn't it? Is there nothing <u>you</u> remember? Not even a detail? You must try.
Ah, that would be cheating, wouldn't it? Is there nothing <u>you</u> remember? Not even a detail? You must try.
You think I haven't been trying! It's like there was never anything there. Just water.
You think I haven't been trying! It's like there was never anything there. Just water.
Water?
Water?
Waves... A beach. A woman whispering. That's all. I need to stay awake. Do you have any pills?
What does she say? The woman.
Asks my name. Over and over. Just like a broken record. Only thing is, I can't answer. I've no idea what my name <u>is</u>.
Asks my name. Over and over. Just like a broken record. Only thing is, I can't answer. I've no idea what my name <u>is</u>.
Your name is John White.
Your name is John White.
That's what people keep telling me.
Bad dreams?
Yes.
Yes.
Tell me about them...
If you like.
You're supposed to be my doctor, right?
You're supposed to be my doctor, right?
That's right. I <u>am</u> your doctor.
Known me for long?
Well...
I cannot say... You don't know the answer to that?
I told you, I can't remember a thing!
Did she drown? The woman you told me about?
Not exactly. She was found in a canal, disembowelled. Throat cut. Blood drained. The body wrapped in a bed-sheet.
Horrible...
You remember nothing, eh? Let me show you something.
We are little more than a sum of memories. From them we reference who we are, where we're going. Without a past we are nothing. This is why you are so interesting.
I'm nothing then.
I'm nothing then.
Anything <u>but</u>, my friend.
Can I get my life back?
Maybe.
I'm sorry. About before.
I don't blame you for getting angry. You are in a frustrating situation. You must be patient though. Trust me completely. I'm here to help.
What are you doing?
I have to go...
I have to go...
You can't go yet. We've got so much to talk about...
You're a liar!
No, it's the truth.
No, it's the truth.
So you're telling me the truth <u>this</u> time? Is that it!
If you would only take this, inject it in your brain, everything would be much clearer.
Not that again...
Not that again...
Everyone get's one - very much like this... But this one's special. It will help you understand, everything...
You've been working too hard.
Please! Don't be foolish! Time is short. Let me show you something. Look at this syringe.
Please! Don't be foolish! Time is short. Let me show you something. Look at this syringe.
Why?
Why?
Don't ask stupid questions. Look at it.
It's a trick.
No it isn't. <u>You</u> are doing it! Now raise it over the glass and...
What are you hiding?
Nothing. I don't know anything!
What happened to you?
I'm... being... punished.
What is it?
We are... living in their dreams...
I thought it would make more sense. I'm getting the pieces, but when I put it together it feels like... Like you're telling me about somebody else's life...
It's the truth... I need you. I know you're innocent.
It's the truth... I need you. I know you're innocent.
How do you know I'm innocent?
How do you know I'm innocent?
Of course you are. You couldn't do those terrible things. Come home with me - maybe things will make sense then...
Of course you are. You couldn't do those terrible things. Come home with me - maybe things will make sense then...
I can't do that. It's dangerous. What about my parents? Do you know where I can find them?
I can't do that. It's dangerous. What about my parents? Do you know where I can find them?
They're dead, John.
How do I get there? Tell me.
That's easy. You...
You understand what you'll be doing?
Yeah... You just want me to wave, right?
Yeah... You just want me to wave, right?
Wave from the door... go down the stairs... get into the limo...
Wave from the door... go down the stairs... get into the limo...

Is this dangerous or anything?
Is this dangerous or anything?
No more than the usual.
No more than the usual.
The usual...
How much do you usually get paid?
Uh -- I don't know. Sometimes it's just like a barter thing... Is this legal?
First Lady...
Don't worry. You won't even see her.
They barely talk anymore.
You're kidding?
You're kidding?
It happens. This is where you'll be sleeping.
Holy cow.
We'll be back for you first thing tomorrow and if you need me for anything, Duane will be right outside the door.
We'll be back for you first thing tomorrow and if you need me for anything, Duane will be right outside the door.
Oh... Okay.
Now, remember -- keep it simple.
Don't worry.
What's with her?
Don't worry about it.
Okay, let's go over it again. You met a girl, you fell in love...
And we're going away for a holiday.
And we're going away for a holiday.
For a month.

Right and don't embellish.

I promise. I won't.
First thing we're gonna work on is the mannerisms. Alan has put together sort of a training program
Great.
I'm not certain about...
Oh, sure. Remember the convention speech?
Dave...
It's in the little leaguer who may strike out but knows in his heart that at least swung... Hands to the side...
Be a professional. If you can convince her - - you can convince anybody.
... Alright.
... Alright.
Now when she comes in, we'll move you right out to the balcony. All you have to say is `thanks for doing this, Ellen.'

No...
That shelter was in this bill.

Lots of shelters were in this bill.

Uh, Mr. President... I don't believe that's on your agenda today.
Well it's a last minute change.
.. Nothing.
Great.
Choices???
Yes, Bob. Choices... Now the Commerce Department..,
What do you think you're doing?!
You mean the press conference? I have a couple of ideas I wanted to share with the country.

You're lint! You're a flea! You're a blip!
Well, maybe I am. But you're fired.

I said you're fired. Go on -- get outta here.
Oh... I'm fired?
Yeah.
You're fired.
Fine...
Fine?
Fine.
Die, you pond scum!
I'm the President and as they say 'The buck stops here.' So I take full responsibility for every one of my illegal acts.
They say it hit both sides of his brain... Even if he makes it he's gonna be a vegetable.
I can't believe he'd do this.
I can't believe he'd do this.
I know.
Where's the girl?
She's a little hysterical right now. We've got her upstairs in a laundry room.

Up and around? Soon?
Up and around? Soon?
Soon.
A condition...
Exactly. A condition.
We think so.
Yes.
Do you know how many different kinds of laws we've broken?
It's simple, Alan. We send the Vice- President to Africa or something, dig up some dirt on him, force him to resign and get our `President' to nominate a new one. The whole thing takes a few weeks tops.
You mean we get `Dave' to nominate you as Vice President.
I was a senator, you know.

One day my wife says to me 'Why don't you try running for office. You talk about it all the time, why don't you just do it?' So I tell my boss I have a dentist appointment and I go down to the registrar of voters on my lunch break. Next thing I know, I'm a councilman.
Really?
Really?
My wife was my campaign manager. We had a two thousand dollar budget.
How'd you get started?
Oh... Kinda the same way.
Oh my God... I thought it was a legitimate deduction, I swear to God. See... I need a piano for my work sometimes...

Well, Miss Henried, what a coincidence. You're just in time fer a case that seems ta concern you. Guess you didn't care about the other proceedin's we been dealin' with here this mornin'.
I'm sorry. I was...busy. In the lab.

Now I think Captain's punishment is fair, considerin'. In fact I think you ain't got shit ta complain about.
I'm sorry, General, if I...spoke out of turn. It's just that...Mr Tyler is not here to defend himself. He has no representation. I don't believe due process is being served by...

That's right. 'Bout eight, if that suits. We'll start out in my gymnasium an' progress on from there...to various other forms o' physical therapy.
The great state of Florida. People came here fer years ta die. Retire and expire. The rest o' the country used ta think we was nothin' but a bunch o' farts and fogies. Hah! Now this here's the new Capital o' the World! Hah! They came here...died...went to hell...and the Devil sent 'em back as an army. Hah! General Gasparilla's army...MY ARMY!
We think there are other cities surviving. We think maybe Detroit... there's some signalling out of Philly.

There's no place like this place. Warm climate. This facility. Christ, there ain't nothin' like this no-damn-where! Even the Feds knew that. That's why they stored so much o' their shit down here. It's all mine now. All mine. Just let 'em try ta come after us down here, which they will some day...take a likin' ta what all we got an' come after

It's not a very big army. And small as it is you won't be able to continue feeding it for very long. We've got to find ways of getting them to respond without relying on...

You'll find the ways, Miss Mary. And when ya do...we'll sail on over to the mainland...or any other damn mainland fer that matter...and start us a recruitin' program. There's millions o' Bees out there jus' waitin' fer' a General ta lead 'em on ta vict'ry!
Bees. That's what we call the dead... the walking dead...here on Gasparilla's island.
Gasparilla?
Gasparilla?
He was a pirate who sailed these waters long ago. His name is bein' borrowed these days by the long lost Henry Dickerson.

That's the man. He's been holed up here ever since the shit hit the fan. Him and his family owned these islands 'round here. They was leasin' this one to the Fed. The whole underneath is dug out. There was missiles here and laboratories and bomb proof housing, nuclear power, all o' that. Now this is Dickerson's....Gasparilla's... private fortress. Him and a bunch o'

Captain Rhodes and his Red Coat Bees. They could sting, sister. We know you came up against 'em. We been watchin' you since you landed. Couldn't help. I'm sorry for that. We ain't supposed to be outside. If we was spotted it could....well, it could be the end of everything.
Thanks. I can fight my own battles.
I know you can. Like I said, we been watchin' you.
The man I was with...until today... believed that praying was for blind men who couldn't see the truth.
How we gonna break the curse without a prayer or two.

We thought we were escaping here. We thought we'd found an uninhabited island. Christ! This place is a worse nightmare than anything I've seen yet!

I'm sure that's true, miss. And that's why we're doin' what we're doin'. What's happenin' underground here is just what Lucifer planned for this sinful race o' man. But we're gonna beat Lucifer. We're gonna put an end to what's happenin' here.

Oh, what did I run into? A bunch o' Jesus nuts? Religiosos? Prayer won't stop a bullet from one of those storm troopers and prayer won't keep one of those monsters from eatin' your liver for lunch.

That's why we didn't use prayers on this here white coat 'til after he was destroyed. We ready to fight when we have to. And we gotta fight now.

Look. I BEEN fightin', mister. I been fightin' for what feels like a hundred years and I'm finished. I don't need religion. I don't need prayers. I need a couple guns and a couple hands. We can sail on outa here. Find another island where there ain't so much....traffic.

You think you can find your boat? There's a thousand little inlets and backwaters all through here. You remember all the ways you turned to get where you are now? You leave yourself a trail?
I can find it myself. I didn't come that far.
Farther than you think. You'll get lost. You will. And there's Bees all through the jungle. I ain't lyin' to ya. Religiosos don't lie.
Farther than you think. You'll get lost. You will. And there's Bees all through the jungle. I ain't lyin' to ya. Religiosos don't lie.
No. They just try to hold you for ransom. Fuck you, Moses! I'm outa here!
They seem to be havin' a good time. Some punishment.
You disappear in here, darlin'. You get a knife in yer belly or too much shit in yer veins. You get lost out here and nobody's gonna notice. Rhodes, he counts on that. It all makes for food in the freezers.
Let me go! I'm the one he wants. This is all happening because of me. If I turn myself in...
He's just finding another reason for bumpin' us off. Don't ya see. He needs us ta die. He needs our bodies.
Toby's right. They're not gonna sit around with their fingers up their asses while we bust up their toys.
Datura.
Datura.
What?
What?
Datura Metel. The Devil's Trumpet. Don't worry. I ain't goin' religioso again. It's a flower that grows on these islands. Where I come from the voodoo priests used it whenever they needed a Mickey Finn. It's toxic. Ground up you can put it in a drink or inject it...or...in a sealed area it might be introduced through the ventilation system.

There's hundreds of 'em. Right where we landed our boat.
Looks like just two. We can take 'em when the time comes.
We're only about a quarter-mile from Cave entrance number five.
What is it?
It's...he was...one who came to the island with me.
How long do we have to watch him?
Forever, darlin'. Forever. 'Til he turns ta dust and blows away on the wind.
It's alright. I'm a friend. I need help and so do you. What's a safe place to talk?
Ain't no place safe.
Ain't no place safe.
Look...I know you have no reason to trust me. I've got friends in the Cave. I got some stuff comin' out this mornin'. I'm gonna try to get off the island.
I'm gonna have this stuff sent over to the hospital...
The hospital?
The hospital?
Yeah. My stuff's all marked with red crosses so nobody gets too nosey. Meet me at the hospital after the supplies come in. Maybe we can find a place there to talk.

Maybe.
What'dya tell that soldier, soldier? You tell him we was rebels?
He's my contact for Chrissake! There's two crates. Can you get me into the hospital?
There ya go. Complete with air canisters...little motors.
We got a boat.

What?

I say we got a boat. Can you get other stuff?
I say we got a boat. Can you get other stuff?
I got some fuel comin' out and, I hope, some automatic rifles.
It won't work. That's pure nitro you're dealin' with there. That stuff can blow if you look at is funny. What're you gonna do, walk into the Cave carryin' those tubes on feather pillows? You don't have a complete layout of the place. Even if you manage to avoid a fight you won't know where to go.
We're hopin' you can show us where ta go, Toby.
We're hopin' you can show us where ta go, Toby.
Oh, no. I'm tryin' to get off this island alive. I'll help you all I can but I'm not goin' in there on a suicide mission. What can you hope to accomplish? Some radios maybe? A supply room or two? You'll all be killed and in a few weeks they'll be back to business as usual. That place was built to withstand nuclear attack!

We know what's down there. We did the loading' and unloadin' when the stuff came ashore in the early days. A direct hit oughta do more than a few weeks worth o' damage.

A direct hit'll blow the top off this whole island! How're you gonna fuse the stuff? How're you gonna leave yourself time to get out?
This stuff really works? No shit?
Quicker than gas. And it smells a lot prettier. It usually don't kill but it puts ya under fer a good night's sleep.

If you could knock out the central communications room you could foul up their whole intercom system. Then, if you move fast enough, stay ahead of 'em...without bein' able to signal each other, they might have a hard time catchin' you.

Come on. Let's go.
That's the general alarm. Jesus! They musta got in!

You are dying, too.

No. The disease was cut away from me. I will live. I will live.
Prayers have no power to save. The knife can save. It can cut the disease away. The bullet. It can shatter the brain where the evil takes seed. These are saviours...our new saviours...our only saviours.

We must wait. One day the curse will pass. One day a dead man will... will...
One day a dead man will refuse to return, and that man will be a saint. The first saint of our century. That's a prayer, too. A catechism. Something the priests tell us to believe.

No wonder they're so....hungry.
You gave them a fresh taste of blood!
They will never be satisfied with anything else, Miss Henried. They want human flesh. I'm prepared to take whatever steps are necessary to see to it they don't get mine! Not while I'm still using it!
You can't run away from the planet, Miss Science. You can't even run away from the island, heh heh.
Leave me alone, you...COCKSUCKER!!!
You're....you're disgusting! You're....FILTH!
And you're the one who builds the bomb and they says, 'I hope it'll never actually be used'.
Julie Grant is a behaviouralist. She's not medical. She hasn't been as...exposed to...to things...as some of the rest of us. She'll be alright. I'll talk to her. She'll be alright.

Rhodes, you and I had a roll in the hay together when I first got here. It was a wholly unsatisfying experience which I do not want to, and which I never will repeat! So give up, mister! I'm going home...to that roommate you mentioned.
I had an unfortunate little run-in with him today. In fact...you might say that Mr. Tyler is in big trouble with the...authorities.
You better not mess with me, Rhodes. I'd love to serve your balls to those Red Coats for lunch! Think about it!
You better not mess with me, Rhodes. I'd love to serve your balls to those Red Coats for lunch! Think about it!
No, Miss Science. You're the one who needs to do some thinking.
Sir. In the matter of the State versus Private Tyler, I don't want to...
Sir, Tyler is innocent of any crime against the State. Captain Rhodes is...

We're both gonna leave. Leave the island. I've been talkin' to Tricks. We think we can smuggle out one of those inflatable rafts. They're crated up real small. They've got air canisters. There's food inside. Even a little motor.

You fired that shot, didn't you?
No, sir.
No, sir.

Why doesn't he let you do what you want?
Yeah! Tell him off! It couldn't get any worse.
How was dinner?
Terrible. Awful! I met the most beautiful girl I've ever seen in my life!
Thigh man? Mr. "K" was a hell raiser.

I don't know. I don't get it.
Come on. It'll help you get Chris.
Come on. It'll help you get Chris.
It will? How do you figure?
It will? How do you figure?
Women swoon!
Women swoon!
But why?
The millions are awake enough for Physical labor; but only one in a million is awake enough for effective intellectual exertion, only one in a hundred millions to a poetic or divine life. To be awake is to be alive.
Hey, this is great.
I feel like I've never been alive. For years I've been risking nothing. I have no idea what I am or what I want to do! Neil, you know you want to act. Knox wants Chris.
Needs Chris! Must have Chris!
Needs Chris! Must have Chris!
Meeks, you're the brain here. What do the dead poets say about somebody like me?
God, I can't take it anymore! If I don't have Chris, I'll kill myself.
Knox, you gotta calm down.
Knox, you gotta calm down.
No, I've been calm all my life! If I don't do something, it's gonna kill me.

Well hell no, Charlie, but that's not the point. That's not the point at all!
What is the point?
What is the point?
The point is she was thinking about me! I've only met her once and already she's thinking about me. Damn it, it's gonna happen! I feel it. She's going to be mine!
How'd it go? Did you read it to her?
Yep.
What do you mean you don't know?
I'll tell you later.
Well, welcome to "Hell"ton.
It's every bit as hard as they say. Unless you're a genius like Meeks.

Oh come on, Cameron, don't you get anything?
How about a trig study group? Right after dinner.
All right. I'll try anything once.
Except sex.
Yaa, I'm a dead poet!
Ahh! Eat it, Dalton!
Ahh! Eat it, Dalton!
This is it.
Hey guys, why don't you show Tina the Dead Poets garden?

Well...
Oh come on, Pitts...
I hereby declare this the Charles Dalton Cave for Passionate Experimentation. In the future, anyone wishing entry must have permission from me.
Wait a minute, Charlie. This should belong to the club.
Wait a minute, Charlie. This should belong to the club.
It should, but I found it and now I claim it. carpe cavern, guys. Seize the cave.
Well, of course not. It's just that... You could have warned us.
I thought I'd be spontaneous. I mean, that's the point of this whole thing, isn't it?
Oh God, it's over now!
Why? Nobody knows who we are.
Why? Nobody knows who we are.
Don't you think they'll figure out who did it?! Don't you know they'll come to you and demand to know what the Dead Poets Society is? Charlie, you had no right to do something like that!

Damn it, Nuwanda. You idiot.
I couldn't stop myself.
But what if they see it, Nuwanda?
So much the better.
I here and now commit myself to daring!
So avoid using the word 'very' because it's lazy. A man is not very tired, he is exhausted. Don't use very sad, use morose. Language was invented for one reason, boys--to woo women--and, in that endeavor, laziness will not do. It also won't do in your essays.
Mr. Keating!
I don't know what misguided impulse caused you to pull that ridiculous stunt, Mr. Dalton, but, whatever it was, I hope you've learned your lesson.

You're siding with Mr. Nolan?! What about carpe diem and sucking all the marrow out of life and all that?

Sucking out the marrow doesn't mean getting the bone stuck in your throat, Charles. You still have responsibilities to yourself and those who care about you.

But I thought-
Yeah? Like what?
Like, if nothing else, the opportunity to attend my classes, understand?
Like, if nothing else, the opportunity to attend my classes, understand?
Yes sir.
Yes sir.
So keep your head about you--the lot of you--understood?
Anything else you'd care to rifle through, Mr. Dalton?
I'm sorry. I, we
It's such a strange name! Won't you tell us what it means?
I told you, that's a secret.
I told you, that's a secret.
Isn't he precious?
Yeah! Don't you guys miss having girls here?
Miss it? It drives us crazy. That's part of what this club is about. In fact, I'd like to announce that I've published an article in the school paper, in the name of the Dead Poets society, demanding girls be admitted to Welton, so we can all stop beating off.
That's right, it's Nuwanda.
And are we just playing around out here or do we mean what we say? If all we do is come and read a bunch of poems to each other, what the hell are we doing?
I think he's sweet.
I think you're sweet.
You know what really excites me about you?
What?
What?
Every guy that I meet wants me for one thing my body. You're not like that.
Every guy that I meet wants me for one thing my body. You're not like that.
I'm not?
I'm not?
No! Anybody else would have jumped my bones by now but you're after my soul. Make me up some more poetry.
No! Anybody else would have jumped my bones by now but you're after my soul. Make me up some more poetry.
But...
But...
Please! It's so wonderful to be appreciated for my mind!
Nuwanda? Please?
All right! I'm thinking! "Let me not to the marriage of true minds Admit impediments; love is not love Which alters when it alteration finds Or bends with the remover to remove."
Don't stop.
"O, no, it is an ever-fixed mark That looks on tempests and is never shaken; It is the star to every wandering bark whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken."
"O, no, it is an ever-fixed mark That looks on tempests and is never shaken; It is the star to every wandering bark whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken."
This is better than sex any day. This is romance!
Welcome. back, Mr. Dalton. How's your father?
Doing fine, sir.
Doing fine, sir.
Your family move into that new house, Mr. Overstreet?
Yes sir. We were just talking about that.
Good. We're very excited about him. He was a Rhodes Scholar, you know.
Welton Academy, hello? Yes, he is, just a moment. Mr. Nolan, it's for you.
what?!
Who else was involved in this?
No one, sir. It was just me. I did the proofing so I inserted my article in place of Rob Crane's.
No one, sir. It was just me. I did the proofing so I inserted my article in place of Rob Crane's.
Mr. Dalton, if you think you're the first to try to get thrown out of this school, think again. Others have had similar actions and they have failed just as surely as you will fail. Bend over and grab your shins.
Do you still insist that this was your idea and your idea alone?
Yes... sir.
Yes... sir.
What is this "Dead Potts Society"? I want names.
What is this "Dead Potts Society"? I want names.
It's only me, Mr. Nolan. I swear. I made it up.
It's only me, Mr. Nolan. I swear. I made it up.
If I find that there are others, Mr. Dalton, they will be expelled and you will remain enrolled. Stand up.
Hey, I heard you went to summer school?
Yeah, chemistry. My father thought I should get ahead.
Yeah, chemistry. My father thought I should get ahead.
Well, Meeks aced Latin and I didn't quite flunk English so if you want, we've got our study group.

Sure, but Cameron asked me too. Anybody mind including him?
Sure, but Cameron asked me too. Anybody mind including him?
What's his specialty, brown-nosing?
Hey, he's your roommate.
That's not my fault.
Todd's brother is Jeffrey Anderson.
Oh yeah. Sure. Valedictorian, National Merit Scholar
Okay, so I don't like it any more than you do. I'm just saying
Then don't tell me how to talk to my father when you're the same way. All right?!
I don't know about anyone else, but I could use a refresher in Latin. Eight o'clock in my room?
Sure.
Sure.
You're welcome to join us, Todd.
Who's in?
I'm in.
I went to the woods because I wanted to live deliberately." I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life!"
All right. I'll second that.
All right. I'll second that.
To put the rout all that was not life. And not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived. Pledge Overstreet.
Charlie, That was great! Where did you learn to play like that?
My parents made me take clarinet but I hated it. The sax is more sonorous.
Charlie...
It's Nuwanda.
It's Nuwanda.
Nuwanda, what is going on?
Nuwanda, what is going on?
Nothing, unless you object to having girls here.
Where'd you find them?
They were walking along the fence past the soccer field. Said they were curious about the school so I invited them to the meeting.
You what?! How did you do that?
I'm one of the proofers. I slipped the article in.
You still shouldn't have done it, Charlie. You don't speak for the club.
Hey, would you not worry about your precious little necks? If they catch me, I'll tell them I made it up. All your asses are safe. Look, Gloria and Tina didn't come here to listen to us argue. Are we gonna have a meeting or what?
What happened? Were you kicked out?
No.
No.
What happened?
What happened?
I'm supposed to turn everybody in, apologize to the school and all will be forgiven.
What are you going to do? - Charlie?
Damn it, Neil, the name is Nuwanda.
Why don't you talk to Mr. Keating about it?
What good will that do?
What good will that do?
Maybe he'll have some advice. Maybe he'll even talk to your father.
Maybe he'll have some advice. Maybe he'll even talk to your father.
Are you kidding? Don't be ridiculous.
This is stupid.
It's better than doing nothing.
It's all right, Chet.
It's not all right. Come on, Dad
Chris. We got it. Let's go.
Nice meeting you, Knox. Bye, Gin.
Oh Chet, that feels fabulous,
It does? What?
It does? What?
You know,
Don't stop.
Stop what?
Stop what?
Chet...
What are you doing?!
Knox?!
You fucked up little prick!
Chet, you don't have to hurt him.
Pleased to meet you.
The pleasure is mine.
So, uh, where are you in school?
Ridgeway High. How's Henley Hall, Gin?
That's your sister school, right?
Sort of.
Sort of.
You going out for the Henley Hall play? They're doing "A Midsummer Night's Dream."
Hello?
Hello Chris, this is Knox Overstress.
Hello Chris, this is Knox Overstress.
Knox. Oh yes, Knox. I'm glad you called.
Knox. Oh yes, Knox. I'm glad you called.
You are? She's glad I called!
Well, sure!
Chet's parents don't know about it, so please keep it quiet. But you can bring someone if you like.
Chet's parents don't know about it, so please keep it quiet. But you can bring someone if you like.
I'll be there. The Danburrys. Friday night. Thank you, Chris.
Oh, hi. I'm glad you made it. Did you bring anybody?
No.
No.
Ginny Danburry's here. Look for her.
Ginny Danburry's here. Look for her.
But, Chris...
But, Chris...
I gotta find Chet. Make yourself at home.
carpe breastum. Seize the breast.
Huh?
Chris!
Knox! what are you doing here?
If Chet sees you, he'll kill you, don't you know that?
I don't care. I love you, Chris. You deserve better than Chet and I'm it. Please accept these.
I don't care. I love you, Chris. You deserve better than Chet and I'm it. Please accept these.
Knox, you're crazy.
Knox, I don't believe this!
All I'm asking you to do is listen. "The heavens made a girl named Chris, With hair and skin of gold To touch her would be paradise To kiss her glory untold."
Chris!
Knox, why are you doing this to me?
Knox, why are you doing this to me?
You can't be in here.
If they catch you here, we'll both be in big trouble.
Oh, but it's fine for you to come barging into my school and make a complete fool out of me?
Oh, but it's fine for you to come barging into my school and make a complete fool out of me?
I didn't mean to make a fool of you.
I didn't mean to make a fool of you.
Well, you did! Chet found out and he's nuts. It took everything I could do to keep him from coming here and killing you. You have to stop this stuff, Knox.
Well, you did! Chet found out and he's nuts. It took everything I could do to keep him from coming here and killing you. You have to stop this stuff, Knox.
But I love you.
But I love you.
You say that over and over but you don't even know me!
Of course I know you! From the first time I saw you, I knew you had a wonderful soul.
Just like that?! You just knew?
Just like that?! You just knew?
Of course just like that. That's how you always know when it's right.
Of course just like that. That's how you always know when it's right.
And if it so happens that you're wrong? If it just so happens that I could care less About you?
And if it so happens that you're wrong? If it just so happens that I could care less About you?
Then you wouldn't be here warning me about Chet.
Look, I've got to go. I'm gonna be late for the play.
Are you going with Chet?
Are you going with Chet?
Chet? To a play? Are you kidding?
Chet? To a play? Are you kidding?
Then come with me.
Then come with me.
Knox, you are so infuriating!
Knox, you are so infuriating!
Just give me one chance. If you don't like me after tonight, I'll stay away forever.
Just give me one chance. If you don't like me after tonight, I'll stay away forever.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
I promise. Dead Poets honor. Come with me tonight, then if you don't want to see me again, I swear I'll bow out.

Chet won't know anything. We'll sit in back and sneak away as soon as it's over.
Chet won't know anything. We'll sit in back and sneak away as soon as it's over.
Knox, if you promise that this will be the end of it-

Dead Poets honor.
Dead Poets honor.
What is that?
What is that?
My Word
I have to go home. Chet might call.
It's just for a little while. You promised.
We thought it would be good to break old habits, sir.
What is wrong with old habits, Mr. Overstreet?
What is wrong with old habits, Mr. Overstreet?
They perpetuate mechanical living, sir. They limit your mind.
They perpetuate mechanical living, sir. They limit your mind.
Mr. Overstreet, I suggest you worry less about breaking old habits and more about developing good study habits. Do you understand?
Mr. Overstreet, I suggest you worry less about breaking old habits and more about developing good study habits. Do you understand?
Yes sir.
Yes sir.
That goes for all of you. Now eat with your correct hands.
Gather ye rosebuds while ye may. The Latin term for that sentiment is "Carpe Diem." Anyone know what that means?
Carpe Diem... seize the day.
Carpe Diem... seize the day.
Very good, Mr._?
Very good, Mr._?
Meeks.
Meeks.
Seize the day while you're young, see that you make use of your time. Why does the poet write these lines?
The hoi polloi. Doesn't it mean the herd?
Precisely, Meeks. Greek for the herd. However, be warned that, when you say "the hoi polloi" you are actually saying the the herd. Indicating that you too are "hoi polloi."
And don't limit poetry to the word. Poetry can be found in a work of art, music, a photograph, in the way a meal is prepared--anything with the stuff of revelation in it. It can exist in the most everyday things but it must never, never be ordinary By all means, write about the sky or a girl's smile but when you do, let
Oh, Captain, My Captain. Is there poetry in math?
Oh Captain, My Captain. What if we don't know anything about someone like Rahesh Non?
Rahesh Non never existed, Mr. Meeks. You make him or someone like him up. No self important college professor such as this one would dare admit ignorance of such an obviously important figure and you will probably receive a comment similar to the one I received:
We used to meet here on special occasions. Who would like to convene the meeting?
"We went to the woods because we wanted to suck all the marrow out of life." Anybody want to read?
This was my first classroom, John, did you know that? My first desk.
I didn't know you taught.
I didn't know you taught.
English. Way before your time. It was hard giving it up, I'll tell you. I'm hearing rumors, John, of some unusual teaching methods in your classroom. I'm not saying they have anything to do with the Dalton boy's outburst, but I don't think I have to warn you that boys his age are very impressionable.

Stretch it, pull it, it will never cover any of us. Kick at it, beat at it, it will never be enough-
Don't stop!
Don't stop!
From the moment we enter crying to the moment we leave dying, It will cover just your head as you wail and cry and scream!
Come on boys, don't be shy.
I have something.
Mr. Keating? Sir? Oh Captain My Captain. What was the Dead Poets Society?
Ah, so you boy's have been snooping.
Ah, so you boy's have been snooping.
I was just looking in an old annual and...
I was just looking in an old annual and...
Nothing wrong with research.
What did the name mean. Did you only read dead poets.
All poetry was acceptable. The name simply referred to the fact, that to join the organization, you had to be dead.
Oh Captain, My Captain, we came here so I could talk to you about something.
Okay.
Okay.
Actually, I'd like to talk to you alone.
Gosh, they don't give you much room around here, do they?
Maybe they don't want worldly things distracting me from my teaching.

Why do you do it? I mean, with all this seize-the-day business, I'd have thought you'd be out seeing the world or something?
Why do you do it? I mean, with all this seize-the-day business, I'd have thought you'd be out seeing the world or something?
Ah, but I am seeing the world, Neil. The new world. Seeing a student like you take root and bloom. It's worth everything. That's why I came back here. A place like this needs at least one teacher like me. Did you come here to talk about my teaching?

Mr. Keating, my father is making me quit the play at Henley Hall. When I think about carpe diem and all that, I feel like I'm in prison! I mean, I can see his point. We're not a rich family like Charlie's. But he's planned the rest of my life for me and he's never even asked me what I want!

You can't live a life for someone else, Neil. You can only live for yourself. Have you told your father what you just told me? Have you shown him your passion about acting?

Are you kidding? He'd kill me!
Are you kidding? He'd kill me!
Then you're playing a part for him too, aren't you? A dangerously self- destructive one.
Neil, I know this seems impossible but you have to go to your father and show him what you're feeling. You have to let him see who you are- It's your only chance.
I know what he'll say. He'll say that acting is just a whim and that it's frivolous and that I should forget about it. He'll tell me how they're counting on me and to put it out of my mind "for my own good."

Well, if it's more than a whim, then you'll have to prove that to him. You'll have to show him with your passion and commitment that it's what you really want to do. If that doesn't work, at least by then you'll be eighteen and able to do what you want.

Eighteen! That's two years! What about the play? The performance is tomorrow night!

Give your father the benefit of the doubt. Talk to him. Let him see who you are.

Isn't there an easier way?
Isn't there an easier way?
Not if you're going to stay true to yourself.
What did your father say? Did you talk to him?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Really? You told your father what you told me? You let him see your passion for acting?
Really? You told your father what you told me? You let him see your passion for acting?
Yeah. He didn't like it one bit but at least he's letting me stay in the play. Of course, he won't be able to come. He'll be in Chicago on business. But I think he's gonna let me stay with acting. As long as I keep my grades up.
Too bad.
It's not too bad. It's a tragedy! Why does she have to be in love with a jerk?!
It's not too bad. It's a tragedy! Why does she have to be in love with a jerk?!
All the good ones go for jerks, you know that. Forget her. Take out your trig book and figure out problem twelve.

I can't just forget her, Pitts. And I certainly can't think about math!
You really think I should forget her?
You have another choice.
Damn. Damn! If I could just get Chris to read this poem!
Why don't you read it to her? It worked for Nuwanda.
Why don't you read it to her? It worked for Nuwanda.
She won't even see me, Pitts.
She won't even see me, Pitts.
Nuwanda recited poetry to Gloria and she jumped all over him... right, Nuwanda?
All right! What'd she say?
I don't know.
Wait a minute. I don't let my parents walk on me.
Yeah, you just do everything they say! You'll be in daddy's law firm as sure as I'm standing here. And you'll be approving loans till you croak.
All right. Jesus, what are you gonna do?
What I have to do. Screw the annual.
They're friends of my dad. Probably in their nineties or something.
Listen, anything's, better than mystery meat.
Are you crazy? What's wrong with that?
She's practically engaged to Chet Danburry. Mr. Mondo Jocko himself.
You know what the dead poets would say: Gather ye rosebuds while ye may...
But she's in love with: the moron son of my father's best friend. What would the dead poets say about that?
Where are you going?
I'm calling her!
I certainly wouldn't lose any sleep over it. It's just a bunch of people trying to impress Nolan.
Screw it all. I don't give a damn about any of it.
Any group pictures in the annual?
Nothing. No mention of it.
His grades are hurting, Charlie.
Then you can help him.
If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost. That is where they should be. Now put foundations under them.
God, I want to do everything! I'm going to explode.
I gotta get to the tryouts. Wish me luck.
Good luck.
But father, I'm assistant editor.
I'm sorry, Neil.
I'm sorry, Neil.
But father, it's not fair.
But father, it's not fair.
Fellows, would you excuse us a minute?
I will not be disputed in public, do you understand me?
Father, I wasn't disputing you.
Father, I wasn't disputing you.
When you've finished medical school and you're on your own, you can do as you please. Until then, you will listen to me.

You know what this means to your mother, don't you?
You know what this means to your mother, don't you?
Yes sir.
You know me, always taking on too much.
Good boy. Call us if you need anything.
Father!
Neil, you are going to quit this ridiculous play immediately.
Neil, you are going to quit this ridiculous play immediately.
Father, I--
Don't you dare talk back to me! It's bad enough that you've wasted your time with this absurd acting business. But you deliberately deceived me! Who put this in your head? How did you expect to get away with it? Answer me!
Nobody- I thought I'd surprise you. I've got all As and-
Nobody- I thought I'd surprise you. I've got all As and-
Did you really think I wouldn't find out?! "My niece is in a play with your son," Mrs. Marks says. "You must be mistaken," I say. "My son isn't in a play." You made a liar out of me, Neil! Now you will go tomorrow and tell them you are quitting.

I don't care if the world is coming to an end tomorrow night, you are through with that play! Is that clear? Is that clear!
I don't care if the world is coming to an end tomorrow night, you are through with that play! Is that clear? Is that clear!
Yes sir.
Weird.
But different.
I say we go tonight. Everybody in?
Where is this cave he's talking about?
Where is this cave he's talking about?
Beyond the stream. I think I know.
Beyond the stream. I think I know.
That's miles.
What is this, a midnight study group?
Forget it, Pitts, you're coming. Meeks, your grades hurting too?
Look at this.
What is it?
What is it?
The god of the cave.
I hear we're going to be roommates. Neil Perry.
Todd Anderson.
Why'd you leave Balincrest?
My brother went here.
My brother went here.
Oh, so you're that Anderson.
My parents wanted me here all along but my grades weren't good enough. I had to go to Balincrest to pull them up.
Well, you've won the booby prize. Don't expect to like it here.
Well, you've won the booby prize. Don't expect to like it here.
I don't.
So what do you think of my father?
I'll take him over mine.
I'll take him over mine.
What?
What?
Nothing.
Nothing.
Todd, if you're gonna make it around here, you've gotta speak up. The meek might inherit the earth but they don't get into Harvard. know what I mean?
Want to come to the study group?
Thanks but I'd better do history.
What is it then?
I... I just don't want to come.
I... I just don't want to come.
But why? Don't you understand what Keating is saying? Don't you want to do something about it?
But why? Don't you understand what Keating is saying? Don't you want to do something about it?
Yes. But
Yes. But
Put what? Goddamn it, tell me.
Put what? Goddamn it, tell me.
I don't want to read.
I don't want to read.
What?
What?
Keating said everybody took turns reading. I don't want to do it.
Keating said everybody took turns reading. I don't want to do it.
God, you really have a problem, don't you? How can it hurt you to read? I mean isn't that what this is all about? Expressing yourself?
I've found it.
Found what?
Found what?
What I want to do! Right now. What is really inside of me.
A Midsummer Night's Dream. What is it?
A play, dummy.

And now he will?
And now he will?
Hell no, but that's not the point. The point is for the first time in my whole goddamned life, I know what I want, and for the first time I'm gonna do it whether my father wants me to or not! Carpe diem, goddamn it!
Neil, how are you gonna be in a play if your father won't let you?
First I gotta get the part, then I'll worry about that.

Jesus Christ, whose side are you on? I haven't even gotten the part yet. Can't I enjoy the idea even for a little while?
By the way, there's a meeting this afternoon. You coming?
I guess.
None of what Mr. Keating has to say means shit to you, does it?
What is that supposed to mean?

No, I want you in. But being in means you gotta do something. Not just say you're in.
Listen Neil, I appreciate your interest in me but I'm not like you. When you say things, people pay attention. People follow you. I'm not like that.

Why not? Don't you think you could be?
Why not? Don't you think you could be?
No! I don't know, I'll probably never know. The point is, there's nothing you can do about it so butt out, all right? I can take care of myself just fine. All right?
No! I don't know, I'll probably never know. The point is, there's nothing you can do about it so butt out, all right? I can take care of myself just fine. All right?

Oh.
Well, maybe they thought you'd need another one. Maybe they thought...
Maybe they don't think at all unless it's about my brother! His birthday's always a big to-do. The stupid thing is, I didn't even like the first one.
Look, Todd, you're obviously under- estimating the value of this desk set.
what?
what?
I mean, this is one special gift! Who would want a football or a baseball bat or a car when they could get a desk set as wonderful as this one!

This play?
This play?
Yes, and acting! It's got to be one of the most wonderful things in the world. Most people, if they're lucky, live about half an exciting life! If I could get the parts, I could live dozens of lives.
You should come to rehearsals. I know they need people to work the lights and stuff.
No thanks.
No thanks.
Lots of girls. The girl who plays Hermia is incredible.

I'll kill you!! I'll fucking kill you!! I'll do it! I'll do it! I'm not playin' around here!
I once saw a guy put a fish in a bottle, then he corked it, sealing it tight, and threw it to a baby octopus. The little sucker felt its way around that bottle, and in less than two minutes, got that cork off, slid inside, and ate that fish.
What the hell are you talking about?
What the hell are you talking about?
Us...I'm talking about us... We're the fish.
And what? These things are octopusses?
I don't know what these things are ...all I know is...

Don't mind him Finnegan...you remember 25...balls of steel... splashing around in a sea of testosterone.
I don't mind him...but I do think it's time for him to get back down below with the rest of the playgroup.
This isn't right Finnegan. I've got a contract.
20 hours on the clock. Out and back. Double for overtime.

If you blow up your boat, how are we going to get to the island?
If you blow up your boat, how are we going to get to the island?

Like I say, Phantom Mary's pretty weird... Lives alone, lives way out in the middle of nowhere with a cat called Pajamas and a cow called Fred. Well, last week I got a call from Phantom Mary, which in itself was very strange...
He's getting married... and we're nuts!
It's all right. Hey, it's all right. We'll be right here, right with you.
How're you guys... I mean, how've you guys been?
Same old thing. Hey, same like always. Nothing's changed. Albert is getting fat.
Well, who'd you get married to?
Aw, it's a long story!
Cynthia! Sure.
That's who.
That's who.
Cynthia! Hey, that's terrific. I mean... Great! That's really great!
What the hell's that for?
What's it for??
How's it feel, huh? How's it feel to be back?
Great. Feels great... Fuckin' A!

Six or eight. And they go wild?
Six or eight. And they go wild?
They have these little sticks, Vince. They call them "chomp chomps", and when you get these girls going, you have to stick 'em in their mouths.
You're full of shit!

You loaded it, Vince! I saw you!

No chance. Not their sector. They ain't even into things this big. Our zone-boy's performing out of a horror show. Something else. Unit nine found a couple cold ones in Hollywood. One Manny Turner. Gun runner. Sounds like a connection to me.

Talk fast. Polls open in half an hour.
Wade did a little reminiscing.
Michael called yesterday. He wants to take Willy for the summer.
What did you say?
What did you say?
I'd think about it.
Mr. Murphy asked about you again at work yesterday.
He just wants me to make him cinnamon cookies like I made for you.

Mom, I hate to break this to you, but there's a whole other species out there you're neglecting. If you've forgotten, they're called 'men'. Sometimes referred to in more colorful language.
Who is it?
Avon Lady!
My man Dubbs.
Who are you? What the fuck do you want?
I want to ask you a few questions.
No, you're not model material. Anything else?
Funny guy.
Fuck you - fuck you.
Fuck you - fuck you.
You helped set up my partner, Sergeant William Wade. I want to know who put you up to it.
You helped set up my partner, Sergeant William Wade. I want to know who put you up to it.
Your mother.
Speak up.
It was Wade's old partner... Gallagher. He was behind it all.
I worked for him... still do. Said he'd make sure I was left alone if I helped put Wade away. He kept his promise for twenty years.
Prepare for a change in lifestyle.
It was Wade's old partner... Gallagher. He was behind it all.
Put that on your political resume.
Looks like you did more than jackoff while I was gone.
Maybe re-animating you wasn't such a bright idea. You look like shit.

Shucks, and I got all dressed up.
Twenty years have passed, Wade. Lay it to rest.
I was set up and you know it... but you swore under oath I was dirty. You helped bury me.
I was set up and you know it... but you swore under oath I was dirty. You helped bury me.
Jury found you guilty, not me. I just called it as I saw it. Fuck that. You were brought here for a reason. Doucet's escaped. Re-animated for his parole hearing. Killed a lot of people. Most of them cops.
I'm not on the force anymore.
Well, you've just been taken off the bench.

I told you. I'm out of the cops and robbers business. Retired twenty years ago. I've been trained as a bus driver. Got a whole route planned and everything. Even nailed down the lingo - '<u>Exact change, please</u>'.

I'm going to bring this down hard. I've got an A-1 badass killer loose, an election day after tomorrow, and I'm risking everything on you. You're going to bring him in. I don't care how. If you do, you'll get your freedom. An official pardon from me. A clean slate. A good job. A chance to get back with your family. If you don't

I remember what he looks like. I can't forget.
Edicon system made these. Ages, photographs. We use it to find missing children.
He's not that old yet. You've lost confidence in me.
He's not that old yet. You've lost confidence in me.
No, but he's going to be by tomorrow. He's aging. 'Bout the entire twenty years lost while being frozen in forty-eight hours. In that time he'll be an old man. Could be a year, an hour, or all at once. Called NPA Syndrome. Natural Pro- gression of Aging. It affects each individual differently. I'm sure it's painful.
You son-of-a-bitch. How do you stop it?
We have an antidote that'll retard the aging process.

Give it to me.
Give it to me.
When you bring in Doucet.
The faster you get Doucet, the younger you'll be.
I'm going to kill you when this is all over.
You're working a partner on this.
I've been alone for twenty years. I don't feel very sociable.
Hello Wade.
Out of the room.
Tell Frick and Frack that means them too.
I'll be alright.
You can't kill me. I'm going to be Mayor tomorrow.
I'm not voting for you.
I'm not voting for you.
Ah, fuck you, Wade. This is bull- shit. You're not going to kill me. You're not going to risk your freedom.
I want to stop aging.
And I want Doucet.
This is a war, Wade. You against him. Vengeance time. The City's just in the way. Kill the fucker. You and me. We'll work things out when the time is right.
Remember my promise.
Remember my promise.
Don't threaten me. I tend to take these things seriously. And get a couple hours sleep. You look like day old shit.

Got compliments coming outta your ass, don't ya?
Just got the call. Took him from school. Bastard nailed the Vice- Principal and a teacher.
Where?
I'm wasting time.
You can't win like this. You'll only get older. This is what you wanted!

That wasn't your plan, was it?
That wasn't your plan, was it?
What are you talking about?
You were planning to send me back to the ice house. You set me up.
You're crazy.
You're crazy.
<u>You</u> were the dirty cop... and I was on to you. You panicked. Afraid I was going to expose you... so you shut me up.
I don't want to hear anymore.
You stole the heroin out of the evidence room and planted it on me. I was iced. What better way to keep me from talking. Stop me if I'm wrong.
That's not your zone. Stick to data entry.
I was part of the escort team that re-animated him. My partner's dead because of this guy.
Wade's in Cryo-Prison.
He could be brought back.
Kill him... kill him.
Simon Doucet. You are under arrest. Please come out with your hands in the air.
Doucet's just offed two of the jurors who put him away. I'm rounding up the rest of them and putting them in police custody. What's your status?
We seem to've come across a 211, sir.
We seem to've come across a 211, sir.
Forget it. Stick to the program.
You two fucks listen up. Doucet's killing people and you're wasting valuable time busting two-bit Technothugs.
But sir, Sergeant Wade saved the hostages.
But sir, Sergeant Wade saved the hostages.
I'm thrilled beyond belief.
Sir, your transmission's fading.
What the hell are you talking about?
You have no evidence. Arrest this man.
You want evidence. I'll give you evidence.
What do you mean he's escaped?! They're not supposed to escape!
It's a real mess down here. Some- thing must a'gone wrong. No man could possess that kind of strength after being frozen for twenty years.

I don't want any press on this. I've got an election to win day after to- morrow.
Sir, your dinner with the union leaders begins in an hour. Your wife will meet you there, so we can leave whenever you're ready.
Fine.
Fine.
I've also drafted a letter to families of officers killed in the line of duty. They'll need your signature.
Sir, your limo's here.
Kill me if you want. Hard line me with that 'I ain't got nothing to lose' bullshit. But you've got plenty to lose 'partner'. You've got a family. I'm giving you a chance to see them. I kept in touch. She never married. All these years. Maybe she loves you. I wouldn't know why.
You okay?
How do I look?

Okay, that's all folks. Commissioner Gallagher has to go.

I have to go home, Sanchez.
Commissioner Gallagher said... ...twenty years is a long time.
No offense, but why'd they partner me with a rookie?
Doucet killed my partner.
See those guys?
Technothugs.
They're going to rob that bank.
How do you know?

Some things never change.
I'll inform dispatch.
There's no time. There are civilians in there. It's about to go down.

You can't turn him off. He's the Commissioner.
I'm not fond of television comedies.
Wanna come?
My insurance won't cover it.
Thanks. Want'a bite? McDonald's vegiroll.

Can I ask you something?
Yes.
Yes.

Why?
I was set up.
You're saying you were put away for a crime you didn't commit?
'Bout the same time I busted Doucet I tried to nail this big-time dealer. I didn't have an ID, but I was close. Too close. Gained the confidence of a badass named Dubbs. He was going to turn me onto the big man. He made me for a cop. Mysteriously my fellow officers discovered ten pounds of heroin in my cruiser.

Yeah. Least I think so. Twenty- six years this March.
What's this place?
This is where I found Doucet twenty years ago. Thought maybe he'd come back.
Yeah.
Hey, Rip Van Winkle, maybe we'd better call it a night.
She's pretty.
Thanks.
You need anything else?
I'll be okay.
I'll be okay.
Good night, Wade.

I'll have a cup of coffee?

Then find me some cigarettes.
Two lousy smokes. You're a real sport.
That cost me two weeks' pay.
Maybe I should turn myself in.
Lighten up. You're going to give yourself an ulcer.
Part of Doucet's cerebellum, a portion called the vermis is under- developed. This area rates response to outside stimuli. Com- pare it to that of a normal law- abiding citizen. It could be why he kills.

Take a look at this.
He had a partner. Our own Ray Gallagher. He tagged Wade dangerously defiant. Psychotic. Reckless. Seems our Commissioner didn't like him much. Busted his buns on a narcotic's violation. Wade was sentenced to twenty-five years.
He went dirty and they made an example of him.

Golly -- I'd like to see all your horses!
Golly -- I'd like to see all your horses!
Maybe you can, sometime, Daniel. I'm a farmer, you know, and like to show my farm -- but the thing I'd like to show you most, you'll have to see for yourself.

What's that, sir?
What's that, sir?
Well -- it's high and it's wide and it goes a long way and there is a wind blowing through it and a blue roof over it -- it's the hills up here and the rivers running south and the new States growing in the West.

Anybody can see that.
Anybody can see that.
You're wrong, Mr. Stone. There are people who live and die without e'er seeing it. They can't see the country for the money in their pockets -- And some think their state's the country, or the way they live is the country, and they're willing to split the country because of that. Well, I hope you'll meet all those, when you're grown. You'll meet

But it didn't stop. I know it didn't stop. Granny told me it didn't.
But it didn't stop. I know it didn't stop. Granny told me it didn't.
No, siree, it didn't. And it won't -- no matter what happens -- just as long as the folks at the fair believe in freedom and Union. So -- Giddyap, Constitution -- and let's keep going, Mr. Stone.
Yes, you did, Daniel! I saw it from the window. And then to lie about it! Give me that beanshooter, Daniel!
It's mine, Ma! Pa made it for me -- and I'm not going to give it to anyone!
It's mine, Ma! Pa made it for me -- and I'm not going to give it to anyone!
Daniel give me that beanshooter!
Daniel give me that beanshooter!
No! No! I won't.
No! No! I won't.
Daniel! ... I've stood just about as much as I can bear!
Daniel, you ought to be in bed.
No, no, I don't want to go to bed. I want to be here for the party.
Mama!
Daniel! ... You must go to sleep.
Daniel! ... You must go to sleep.
I don't want to be up there all alone, Mama.... I want to be with you.
I don't want to be up there all alone, Mama.... I want to be with you.
All right, darling.
Granny, when do we move to the new house?
Move? -- We are not going to move -- the old one is good enough for us.
Move? -- We are not going to move -- the old one is good enough for us.
But I like the new one better.
But I like the new one better.
That's just too bad --
Lan's to goodness, what happened to that hen? Did you use that beanshooter again?
I did not, Grandma.
Grandma, look at me!
I see you! Riding pretty high, ain't you? Look out you don't fall off.
I see you! Riding pretty high, ain't you? Look out you don't fall off.
Not me!
Howdy, Jabez.
Howdy, Hank.
Howdy, Hank.
Kin you spare a moment for me Jabez?

Why, of course, Hank -- I've always got time for a neighbor. What's on your mind?
Why, of course, Hank -- I've always got time for a neighbor. What's on your mind?
Well -- here's how it is ...Tom Sharp, Eli Higgins and a couple of others been talking to me about -- that new sort of organization -- grange they call it. What you think about it?

Yes, but what does a farmer do if he don't want to get roped in some more by them loan sharks?

Oh -- you don't have to go to Miser Stevens while I'm around.

Don't I? ... Say, that's mighty white of you, Jabez.
Don't I? ... Say, that's mighty white of you, Jabez.
Not at all, Hank ... not at all. Glad to help you.
Not at all, Hank ... not at all. Glad to help you.
Thanks, Jabez -- I really wouldn't need very much ... if you could let me have some seed to start off with enough for spring planting ...
Say ... about the interest ...
Now don't you worry about that. You just leave it all to me. We won't talk business now ... just bear this in mind ... I'm not the man to get rich on other people's hard luck.... No, sir... not me! ...
Loan shark -- hey?
Too bad it didn't happen to Miser Stevens.
Too bad it didn't happen to Miser Stevens.
Are you one of old Stevens' customers too?
Are you one of old Stevens' customers too?
Sure am.
Sure am.
Yes, it's the debt and the lien and the mortgage that eats up the farmer!
Sure does. But I'll have to sleep on it a couple of nights.
That's fair enough, Jabez. Man's got a right to mull things over. We'll drive round again, week or so.
I am just thinkin' -- now they mightn't like the idea down in Washington.
Why not! There's a bill up in Congress to give us a uniform law of bankruptcy. Daniel Webster is fighting for it right now--

What do you want?
Howdy, Mr. Stone. We've come round to ask you if you made up your mind to join the Grange?
Howdy, Mr. Stone. We've come round to ask you if you made up your mind to join the Grange?
What Grange?
What Grange?
That farmers' association -- we were talking about the other day.
Well -- we don't mean to force you, Jabez Stone -- but -- it's only for your own good.
I'll look out for myself! ... Now go away -- leave me alone.
Jabez -- will you join our Grange now?
Why, thank you, Tom. I was going to ask you if you thought I could.
Why, thank you, Tom. I was going to ask you if you thought I could.
We'll be mighty glad to have you with us.
You're not -- Dorothy.
No. She's gone.
No. She's gone.
She couldn't be gone!
She couldn't be gone!
But she is -- I've taken her place. Don't you remember -- you wrote me a letter. Mrs. Stone was too ill.
Never mind. What's your name?
Belle.
Belle.
Belle --
Stevens!
Well, Stone -- have you got the money?
Well, Stone -- have you got the money?
I barely managed to scrape up a bit for you. I thought if I made a kind of part payment --

-- in gold.

I'd like to know where you'd get it....

You know -- some folks are just lucky. Others pick gold right out of the air. Like that!

Real! Sheriff, you are a witness that this money is paid me voluntarily, and while it does not satisfy the mortgage, it has become my property.

Doesn't satisfy, eh? Well -- that's too bad....
Mornin', Jabez ...
Hello, Stevens ... you're early today.
Hello, Stevens ... you're early today.
Yes, I wanted to get here before the others.... I want to talk to you alone.
Yes, I wanted to get here before the others.... I want to talk to you alone.
Some other time, Stevens.
Good evening -- I'm sorry, Jabez -- I'm a little late.
No, you're not.
No, you're not.
Where's everybody?
Where's everybody?
I dunno -- I can't figure it out. I've invited them all. Why don't they come?
Now run along, Daniel.
What a fine boy you have, Jabez. How old is he now?
What a fine boy you have, Jabez. How old is he now?
Almost seven. No -- no, he's not seven yet I am sure --
Almost seven. No -- no, he's not seven yet I am sure --
Well -- it seems to me -- I remember when you paid me--
What's the matter with you?
You are afraid!
You are afraid!
Afraid ... of what?
Afraid ... of what?
-- of what happens after we die!
-- of what happens after we die!
Are you plumb crazy, man! What do you think happens? We're buried -- that's all.

Huh? -- What's that? Well -- what about it? Who cares, anyhow?
Huh? -- What's that? Well -- what about it? Who cares, anyhow?
I do -- and I think you should too.
I do -- and I think you should too.
Stevens -- what's all this leading up to? You know something. Come on! Out with it -- you know something about me!
Do you deny that you called me? I've known people in other States who went back on their word. But I didn't expect it in New Hampshire.
You can't say that to me! I'm New Hampshire. If I say I called you, I did. I guess I did.
You can't say that to me! I'm New Hampshire. If I say I called you, I did. I guess I did.
You've had a lot of bad luck these days. And yet -- it's all so unnecessary. When I think of your opportunities --
You've had a lot of bad luck these days. And yet -- it's all so unnecessary. When I think of your opportunities --
Opportunities?
Opportunities?
Of course. Why man, you have one of the richest farms in the county. You just go about it the wrong way -- so many men do. Hard work -- well, that's all right for people who don't know how to do anything else. It's all right for people who aren't lucky -- but once you're lucky -- you don't work for other people.

Well, now, Mister, that sounds all right. But--
Well, now, Mister, that sounds all right. But--
A clever man like yourself -- he can find money anywhere. Money to pay his bills -- money for his wife and his children -- money to be a rich man. All he needs is a friend to point it out to him. Like that!
Where did it come from?
Oh, you know the old story -- the Hessian wagon train that was ambushed on the way to Saratoga. Some of the gold has been buried under your barn!

Yes, why shouldn't it?
Yes, why shouldn't it?
Yes, of course, people forgot -- or the men who knew about it died, you know how these things happen.
It's mine?
That's right, Mr. Stone -- there is -- -- just one little formality. I'd like your signature here -- see. And when it's done -- it's done for seven years. It's our usual form. Of course -- we may be able to take up the question of a renewal in due time.

What does it mean here -- about my soul?
What does it mean here -- about my soul?
Well, why should that worry you. A soul -- a soul is nothing. Can you see it, smell it, touch it? -- No! -- Think of it -- this soul -- your soul -- a nothing, against seven whole years of good luck! You will have money and all that money can buy. Upon my word, Neighbor Stone, if it weren't for my firm's
No, no! Give it to me!
A pin, Neighbor Stone! I'm afraid, you'll have to prick your finger -- but what's a little pain to a lucky man?
Excellent. A firm, fair signature. One that will last till doomsday. My dear Neighbor Stone, I congratulate you! You're going to be the richest man in New Hampshire!
Well, I'll be --
Well, I'll be --
Yes, indeed. But not now. Not for seven years. Oh, I almost forgot -- what is the date?
Yes, indeed. But not now. Not for seven years. Oh, I almost forgot -- what is the date?
The seventh day of April --
The seventh day of April --
1840. Well, that'll take us to the seventh day of April in 1847.
Good evening, Neighbor Stone.
Look here now--
Look here now--
Oh come, Neighbor Stone. I wouldn't cut that tree if I were you. It means a breach of contract.
Oh come, Neighbor Stone. I wouldn't cut that tree if I were you. It means a breach of contract.
I don't care.
I don't care.
But you should, now that you are becoming a father.
But you should, now that you are becoming a father.
Leave your tongue off of that!
Leave your tongue off of that!
Oh, certainly. I shan't even come to the christening -- it would be tactless and in wretched bad taste. But I may send a friend of mine -- just for old sake's sake. Yes, I might do that.
Why, Mr. Stone, you look so worried. Can I be of any service?
You promised me prosperity, happiness, love, money, friendship --
You promised me prosperity, happiness, love, money, friendship --
Just a minute, neighbor Stone. I promised you money and all that money can buy. I don't recall any other obligations. But let's look at the contract.
.... Miser Stevens' soul, Mr. Stone. Yes -- I am sorry for the disturbance.
He ain't dead -- he's dancing in there.
He ain't dead -- he's dancing in there.
He was --
Are they all as -- small -- as that?
Small? Oh, I see what you mean. Why, they vary. Now a man like Daniel Webster, if I ever get hold of him, I'd have to build a special box for him and even at that, I imagine, the wing spread would be astonishing. In your case --
Small? Oh, I see what you mean. Why, they vary. Now a man like Daniel Webster, if I ever get hold of him, I'd have to build a special box for him and even at that, I imagine, the wing spread would be astonishing. In your case --
My time isn't up yet.
Trying to break our contract again, Mr. Stone?
I'm through with you.
I'm through with you.
What a headstrong fellow! Well -- I guess you're quite prepared to suffer the consequences.
What a headstrong fellow! Well -- I guess you're quite prepared to suffer the consequences.
I have still a year -- a year to make up for everything.
I have still a year -- a year to make up for everything.
Oh no, you violated clause five of our contract and I could collect right now, if I chose.
Oh no, you violated clause five of our contract and I could collect right now, if I chose.
Not now! Not now! -- Let me make up -- let me make up.
Not now! Not now! -- Let me make up -- let me make up.
Suddenly you seem quite desperate, Mr. Stone -- -- You know I'm a good-natured man. I'm always open to reason. With a little security -- I might--
Suddenly you seem quite desperate, Mr. Stone -- -- You know I'm a good-natured man. I'm always open to reason. With a little security -- I might--
Anything -- anything. -- You can have it all back -- that money -- the new house -- my farm -- the whole caboodle!

I'm afraid that's hardly the sort of security I was thinking of -- You see -- there is that promising little fellow, your son ...
I'm afraid that's hardly the sort of security I was thinking of -- You see -- there is that promising little fellow, your son ...
No! No! No! Not him -- not my son -- I'd rather go with you -- right now.
No! No! No! Not him -- not my son -- I'd rather go with you -- right now.
Come, come, Mr. Stone, you are a little upset. It's not fair to bargain with you now. -- I'll give you until midnight, Mr. Stone, but not one minute more. Ah, then you'll come with me indeed.
Well now, Mr. Stone, did you make up your mind?
About what?
About what?
Are you willing to give me your son in exchange for an extension of our contract?
Are you willing to give me your son in exchange for an extension of our contract?
Never!
Jabez Stone -- did you or did you not sign this document?
Yes, I did -- but you tricked me into signing it! You told me my soul was nothing ... that I could forget all about a soul, in exchange for money. That was a lie, a lie, a lie.
Yes, I did -- but you tricked me into signing it! You told me my soul was nothing ... that I could forget all about a soul, in exchange for money. That was a lie, a lie, a lie.
That is highly irrelevant to this case, Your Honor.
Yes -- yes, I am the richest man -- too rich. I can't think of anything but money. That's the trouble with me.
But, Mr. Stone, I am hardly to blame for the pricking of your wholly unnecessary conscience. Is this your signature?
But, Mr. Stone, I am hardly to blame for the pricking of your wholly unnecessary conscience. Is this your signature?
You know darn well it is.
You know darn well it is.
Gentlemen, the prosecution rests.
Ten throws -- Mr. Webster?
Ten throws it is.
You win. Will you ride to the village with me, Mr. Stone?
Thank you, Mr. Webster.
I don't seem to be so very popular after all -- in Cross Corners.
Seems like it's my fault, Mr. Webster.
Seems like it's my fault, Mr. Webster.
Not at all, lad -- not at all. For a good game of horseshoes I would always sacrifice fame and acclaim.
Here's a man who knows what's good for Dan'l Webster! Medford rum! Ah, a breath of the Promised Land! To the champion of the Iron Horseshoe, Jabez Stone!
Thanks, Mr. Webster! To the champion of the whole United States -- Dan'l Webster!
Eloquent speech, Neighbor Stone -- couldn't have done better myself -- -- under the circumstances. Thank you.
Mr. Webster -- I'd like you to meet my wife, Mary.
Mr. Webster -- I'd like you to meet my wife, Mary.
Well -- I'll be -- if it isn't little Mary Sampson from Franklin.
Well -- Mr. Webster! This is a great day for me. Come on in, sir. I want you to take the seat of honor and meet all my guests!
That's just fine, Neighbor Stone -- but -- I have to be pretty careful of my seats of honor -- where I sit, I mean. You see, the whole country sort of has its eye on me, Jabez -- anybody in public life has that difficulty -- even you, Jabez. They watch us carefully, our neighbors and our enemies, and they see much more

They watch us carefully, our neighbors and our enemies, and they see much more
What -- what's on your mind?
What -- what's on your mind?
You, Jabez Stone -- you and a lot of poor farmers, hereabouts -- good men of the earth who are in trouble because of you. Or -- am I wrong about those contracts, Mr. Stone?
You, Jabez Stone -- you and a lot of poor farmers, hereabouts -- good men of the earth who are in trouble because of you. Or -- am I wrong about those contracts, Mr. Stone?
Contracts? -- Yes, they have contracts with me -- lots of 'em -- but -- but that's all right. Without me and my money, they wouldn't have anything.
Contracts? -- Yes, they have contracts with me -- lots of 'em -- but -- but that's all right. Without me and my money, they wouldn't have anything.
They'd have a good neighbor, Jabez -- and that's worth much more than anything else -- much, much more!
I'm sorry you can't see that, I know you could once -- you made a little speech once, that I'll always remember and I know the others do too -- They remember and they see how you have changed. That's why they didn't want to come tonight to you, Jabez -- you're as blind as a Burma bat, with your gold pot! Mind you,
I -- I don't know what you're talking about! I -- I haven't time to listen to all this --
I -- I don't know what you're talking about! I -- I haven't time to listen to all this --
No -- you haven't time -- You haven't time for your mother, or your wife, or your child.
No -- you haven't time -- You haven't time for your mother, or your wife, or your child.
It's your fault! You brought Daniel Webster here -- just to try to make a fool of me! You played the sneak behind my back -- made up all sorts of lies against me! You can get yourself out of my home -- go back to the other house -- that old place, where you belong -- I don't want to -- to talk
It's here you said that you closed the deal with him?
Yes, Mr. Webster -- it was here where it all began.
Yes, Mr. Webster -- it was here where it all began.
I see. And this is where he'd like to collect, too.
I see. And this is where he'd like to collect, too.
Yes -- at midnight.
They make plucky women in New England. H'm ... how long have we to wait?
Not long -- now.
Not long -- now.
Then I'll just christen the jug, with your permission, Stone. Somehow or other, waiting's wonderfully shorter with a jug.
There's nothing like it. I saw an inchworm take a drop of it once, and he stood right up on his hind legs and bit a bee. Come -- try a nip!
There's no joy in it for me.
There's no joy in it for me.
Oh, come, man, come. Just because you've sold your soul to the devil that needn't make you a teetotaler.
You were worried, Jabez, weren't you?
Well, I --
Well, I --
I know -- that was mighty queer Medford -- knew it the minute I tasted it. But it takes more than that to down Daniel Webster.
Ma says breakfast's ready, Mr. Webster!
Breakfast ... Ah! ... Come along friends, Ma Stone's a cook this side of heaven.
Coming along, Jabez?
Shall we?
Why -- good morning, Squire.
Morning, Jabez.
Ahem -- we want to have a little confidential talk with you, Neighbor Stone. Don't like to take a man away from his planting -- but sometimes --
Come right into the parlor, won't you, folks.
Mighty good of you to come out, Squire -- sparing all this time to -- Sheriff, too -- and Schoolmaster -- mighty nice.
Ahem -- Neighbor Stone, we want--
Oh!
Headache -- Squire?
Headache -- Squire?
Worst I had in years -- ahem -- starting a spring cold, I guess -- er -- don't happen to have a bit of camomile tea in the house, do you, Stone?
Worst I had in years -- ahem -- starting a spring cold, I guess -- er -- don't happen to have a bit of camomile tea in the house, do you, Stone?
Camomile tea!
And so, Jabez Stone, in the name of the Whig Party of Cross Corners, we offer you the nomination of that party for Selectman.
Selectman? Selectman of the village? Me?
But -- I was just lucky.
Well? Don't a politician have to be?
Howdy, Squire! Howdy! Oh -- how do you do, Squire.
How do you do, Belle? How are you, Jabez? Well -- mighty elegant house you got here.
How do you do, Belle? How are you, Jabez? Well -- mighty elegant house you got here.
You really think so?
Well, Jabez -- I'm a little pressed for time. You wanted to discuss something -- some business --
Oh yes -- yes. Won't take a minute. Can you keep a secret?
Oh yes -- yes. Won't take a minute. Can you keep a secret?
Why of course --
Why of course --
Dan'l Webster is coming to my party.
Dan'l Webster is coming to my party.
Dan'l Webster?
Dan'l Webster?
Yes -- and that's the reason I wanted to talk with you. You got my invitation?
Yes -- and that's the reason I wanted to talk with you. You got my invitation?
Yes.
Yes.
Now look -- here's a list of the people I invited -- they're all the right kind of people -- or did I miss anybody?

The only one you missed -- is the President.
The only one you missed -- is the President.
You think that's a joke? I had him on there too, but I was afraid Dan'l Webster might feel insulted.
You keep that -- that's for you. I want you to talk up the party to make sure that the best folks really come.
You want me to go around --
You want me to go around --
Yes siree -- that's the idea. Get them all here and then say: "Look, folks -- here's Daniel Webster, my guest of honor." Golly, I can see their eyes pop already.
Yes siree -- that's the idea. Get them all here and then say: "Look, folks -- here's Daniel Webster, my guest of honor." Golly, I can see their eyes pop already.
You mean that's all you had me come out here for?
You mean that's all you had me come out here for?
Now, Squire, you're not going to let me down. We still want to do a lot of business together, don't we?
Now, Squire, you're not going to let me down. We still want to do a lot of business together, don't we?
Well -- yes --
Well -- yes --
That's fine. Now you can tell people all about the house, but don't mention Webster.
That's fine. Now you can tell people all about the house, but don't mention Webster.
You are not so sure that he'll come.
You are not so sure that he'll come.
Oh yes -- I am -- want to bet?

Why not -- ?
Why not -- ?
How much?
How much?
5000 -- that's just what I owe you.
5000 -- that's just what I owe you.
Shake!
Jabez -- help!
Coming.
Down, Shep! Down!
He only wants you to throw the stick for him, Jabez. I guess he's feeling the spring a-coming, too.
He only wants you to throw the stick for him, Jabez. I guess he's feeling the spring a-coming, too.
All right -- only he needn't dirty my pants!
What is that smile on your face? Is there anything wrong with me?
Now, Jabez! I've got on my Sunday bonnet and I'm going to church with my husband. Almost the first time since the beginning of winter -- and if that isn't an occasion, I don't know what is.
Now, Jabez! I've got on my Sunday bonnet and I'm going to church with my husband. Almost the first time since the beginning of winter -- and if that isn't an occasion, I don't know what is.
You're right, Mary.
I think his leg is broken.
Oh, Jabez.
Oh, Jabez.
Yep.
I remember Dad used to say sometimes, when they were handing out hard luck, the farmers got there first.
Jabez, don't you remember your own wedding? We said it's for better or worse. We said it's for richer or poorer.
Jabez, don't you remember your own wedding? We said it's for better or worse. We said it's for richer or poorer.
That's what we said.
He's stubborn as a Stone.
Hold the splint tighter -- it's almost done. Go on reading, Ma. This man, Job, he had troubles, didn't he?
Well, I'll be -- there's a rig, turning in, by the gate.
Who is it?
Who is it?
It's Tom Sharp and two other fellers -- Oh, glory -- where's my pants?
" ... and if the final vote shall leave thousands of our fellow citizens and their families in hopeless distress, can we -- members of the Government -- go to our beds with a clear conscience, can we, without self- reproach, supplicate the Almighty Mercy to forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors?
That's wonderful language. It would move a stone.
That's wonderful language. It would move a stone.
If it would only move old Miser Stevens -- We've still got to pay him.
Well -- what are we going to do?
We can still use my butter money.
We can still use my butter money.
Your butter money?

Do you think I'm grudging it?
Do you think I'm grudging it?
Mary -- it's gone.
Mary -- it's gone.
Not all of it?
Not all of it?
Yes -- I had to pay the vet in full. He just wouldn't have treated the horse this time. After all, we can't very well do without a horse.
Yes -- I had to pay the vet in full. He just wouldn't have treated the horse this time. After all, we can't very well do without a horse.
It's all right, Jabez. We'll find something to pay Stevens.

You always said, the field uphill needs a rest, but if you think --
Mary, I'm a farmer -- always will be. To me seed isn't a thing to pay debts with, it's alive, more alive than anything -- but I guess you're right. We just got to do it. Oh -- how's it all going to end?
Mary, I'm a farmer -- always will be. To me seed isn't a thing to pay debts with, it's alive, more alive than anything -- but I guess you're right. We just got to do it. Oh -- how's it all going to end?
Jabez -- you ought to talk to Tom about joining the Grange.
Jabez -- you ought to talk to Tom about joining the Grange.
I will, Mary -- always thought a man could be stronger alone -- seems I've been wrong about that.
Jabez!
Seed alone won't do, Mary. We have to throw the calf in.
Seed alone won't do, Mary. We have to throw the calf in.
Oh Jabez! And we were counting on ... It's a lovely calf.
Oh Jabez! And we were counting on ... It's a lovely calf.
You're right, Mary it's a fine calf. That's why Stevens'll take it for the rest of the payment.
Mary--
Jabez ...
Jabez ...
Mary -- how do you feel?
I'll get the doctor.
No, Jabez -- all I need is some rest -- You go and pay our debt. Everything'll be all right then ... everything.
Mary -- what would you do with a pot o' gold?
Jabez!
Jabez!
Mary -- what would you do?
Mary -- what would you do?
Well -- I -- I don't know -- I would pay our debts and well -- maybe get a new bonnet, but -- really -- I think I would live the same.
Well -- I -- I don't know -- I would pay our debts and well -- maybe get a new bonnet, but -- really -- I think I would live the same.
Mary -- look! Hessian gold. I found it in the barn.
It feels fine now, Jabez.
Will you come into town with me tomorrow?
Will you come into town with me tomorrow?
I'd love to.
What do you think of that, Jabez?
Looks right elegant, Mary.
We must go on home, Jabez.
Yes, Mary. It's been a long day.
Remember, Mary, how he said it: "Couldn't have done better myself, Jabez Stone," and it was my first speech. I don't know what came into me, Mary. I just stood up and the words came flowing like water out of my mouth.
Oh, Jabez -- it was a wonderful day --
But I'm glad to be home again --
Tired?
Tired?
Worried!
Worried!
There is nothing to worry about now.
There is nothing to worry about now.
You'll never change -- will you?
You'll never change -- will you?
Mary -- you just wait and see -- It's all -- just the beginning -- just the beginning -- of everything. I'll be the biggest man in New Hampshire and you'll be the wife of the biggest man.
There's hope and promise in it, Jabez -- Planting and promise of good harvest to come.
Yes -- you are right, Mary. I can almost hear the little blades of grass a-starting up -- All the seeds a-stirring underneath the ground --
Yes -- you are right, Mary. I can almost hear the little blades of grass a-starting up -- All the seeds a-stirring underneath the ground --
Don't take cold, Jabez. Come -- it's warm in here.
Mary --
Jabez --
Mary, get three cups of camomile tea for the Squire and the rest. They all feel colds coming on.
I'll get it, Jabez.
I'll get it, Jabez.
Thanks, Mary.
Mary! I'm -- Selectman of Cross Corners!
Oh -- Jabez.
You could have knocked me down with a feather -- Selectman -- me.
I'll never get my washing done.
I'll never get my washing done.
That's one thing I want to talk to you about, Mary.
That's one thing I want to talk to you about, Mary.
Yes, Mr. Selectman!
Yes, Mr. Selectman!
I'm serious.
I'm serious.
It's very becoming to you, Mr. Selectman.
It's very becoming to you, Mr. Selectman.
But it's not very becoming to you to have your hands in the suds -- when the Squire and his wife --

Well -- that's the last time -- we'll have servants to do it.
Well -- that's the last time -- we'll have servants to do it.
No, no. I don't want to be idle.
No, no. I don't want to be idle.
And I don't want to have a washwoman for a wife.
Jabez -- once you said we'd never change --
I wasn't used to being big -- wasn't used to thinking in big ways. Now, I've made up my mind.
Ruined -- all the fields -- ruined.
Mary -- but look -- it didn't touch an ear of my corn -- we'll have a rich harvest.
Mary --
Hello, Jabez -- Here's your son.
Well -- I -- I-
Don't be cross with him, Ma. This don't happen every day.
Potato bug sits on the leaf in the sun, Sleep, sleep, my baby -- Raccoon sits in the spruce all night, Sleep, baby, sleep --
What in sugar hill's the matter with him?
What in sugar hill's the matter with him?
Nothing, Jabez -- just natural for a baby to cry, sometimes. Shh, little Daniel -- sleep -- sleep --
What happened.... Where are you taking him?
I am going to lock him up.
I am going to lock him up.
You're not supposed to punish my son, Mary.
Jabez -- how can you let her talk like that when the boy is present? He won't respect me any more.
Isn't that your own fault?
Isn't that your own fault?
My fault? ... Oh, Jabez -- all I want is to be proud of him. He can be such a fine boy, if we show him how to be.
My fault? ... Oh, Jabez -- all I want is to be proud of him. He can be such a fine boy, if we show him how to be.
He's my son and I like him the way he is. Why do you always have to pick on him? If it's not the boy it's me. You don't like the way I live -- you don't like my friends, or my new house -- or anything.
He's my son and I like him the way he is. Why do you always have to pick on him? If it's not the boy it's me. You don't like the way I live -- you don't like my friends, or my new house -- or anything.
But Jabez, I never said that!
But Jabez, I never said that!
It shows on your face.
It shows on your face.
Well -- I am worried about the way you've changed. That was one thing you said you'd never do -- remember?
Well -- I am worried about the way you've changed. That was one thing you said you'd never do -- remember?
Oh, for heaven's sake, leave me alone!
Why don't they come --
I don't know, Jabez.
Think this room is larger than anything Webster's got at Marshfield? You've been there. What about it, Mary?
It's -- different, Jabez -- that's all.
It's -- different, Jabez -- that's all.
What's the matter with 'em? Why don't they come?
Mr. Webster ... Wait! ... Mary!
Jabez!
Jabez!
Mary! Come back ...
Mary! Come back ...
Oh, Jabez! ... Did you hear, Mr. Webster? -- Now you'll help him, won't you?
You must go now, Mary -- you must!
All right, Jabez ...
Jabez -- Jabez!
Mary!
"There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God and eschewed evil."
Consarn the consarn --

Jabez! What kind of talk is that for the Sabbath? And me a-reading the holy word!
Jabez! What kind of talk is that for the Sabbath? And me a-reading the holy word!
Sorry, Ma -- but this consar-- this little pig -- He won't let me fix him --
You know that, son.
Hard luck -- like me.
Hard luck -- like me.
Now, Jabez Stone -- as for what you're calling hard luck -- well, we made New England out of it. That and codfish.
Now, Jabez Stone -- as for what you're calling hard luck -- well, we made New England out of it. That and codfish.
That's right, Ma -- we ain't licked yet. A Stone's never licked till he's dead -- that's what Dad used to say, didn't he, Ma?
There! Guess that ought to hold good. Put him down here, by the fire, Mary. But we don't want to get him too close -- we'll have roast pork for supper.
Not on the Sabbath you won't, Jabez!
How'd you know to have the calf ready, Ma?
I just figgered -- knew you didn't have enough bills.
I just figgered -- knew you didn't have enough bills.
Yes -- and you figgered right, consarn it!
Yes -- and you figgered right, consarn it!
That's a word you're too free with lately, Jabez, consarn this and consarn that ...
That's a word you're too free with lately, Jabez, consarn this and consarn that ...
Helps sometimes to say it.
Helps sometimes to say it.
All right, son -- if it helps.
What's ailing that dog?
I dunno.
I dunno.
Well ... make him keep quiet.
Well ... make him keep quiet.
And why should I? Let him howl if it makes him feel good. Consarn it. He's better off than I am! I wish I could tell Him... ... up there, just what I think.
And why should I? Let him howl if it makes him feel good. Consarn it. He's better off than I am! I wish I could tell Him... ... up there, just what I think.
Hush up such talk, Jabez!
Hush up such talk, Jabez!
I can't help it. I mean it, I tell you. I've had more than my share. Nothing ever goes right for me -- nothing!
You found it in the barn, hey?
Yes -- I was getting the seed -- I stumbled -- I saw one of the boards warped up a bit -- and -- there it was.
Yes -- I was getting the seed -- I stumbled -- I saw one of the boards warped up a bit -- and -- there it was.
Most outlandish thing I ever heard tell. Don't seem right, somehow!
Most outlandish thing I ever heard tell. Don't seem right, somehow!
But it's true. Take 'em up in your hands, Mary -- feel 'em -- they're real all right. Aren't you glad?
Well -- that's comforting! Supper.
Say, Mary, how is your shoulder?
Well, son, I'm glad to see a Stone come up in the world again.
Now look here, Ma. I'm not a boy anymore. I want that understood. I don't aim to stay a one-horse farmer the rest of my life. Mary's got to be the kind of wife a -- a big man needs --
It won't be the first baby ever born in this house. There! Made me drop a stitch! Sit down, you make me nervous! Lan's, that's the way a man always is. Thinks his son's the most important thing in the world.
My son! Do you really think, Ma....
My son! Do you really think, Ma....
Oh, go along with you! As if it mattered to a grandma! But p'raps you got an even chance.
Queer sort of weather we're having -- queer like everything else.
Well, thank the Lord you can always depend on New England for weather. We've got enough for the whole United States.

I feel -- fidgety, Ma -- not right at all.
I feel -- fidgety, Ma -- not right at all.
Lan's, I'd think you was having the baby, to hear you.
Lan's, I'd think you was having the baby, to hear you.
Me -- a son.
Money -- money's a funny thing, ain't it, Ma?
I figure that depends a mite on how you get it and how you spend it, Son.
I figure that depends a mite on how you get it and how you spend it, Son.
Do you really think that?
Do you really think that?
Why, that's just sense, Son. Now a man like Daniel Webster -- guess they pay him high for what he does. But he's worth it -- and he helps others. Makes all the difference.
Why, that's just sense, Son. Now a man like Daniel Webster -- guess they pay him high for what he does. But he's worth it -- and he helps others. Makes all the difference.
I know, Ma, but -- Suppose a man got his money in bad ways --
I know, Ma, but -- Suppose a man got his money in bad ways --
Wouldn't profit him none.
You see, son? I'm old and I've lived. When a man gets his money in bad ways -- when he sees the better course and takes the worse -- then the devil is in his heart -- and that fixes him.
Ma -- and yet, a man could change that, couldn't he?
Ma -- and yet, a man could change that, couldn't he?
A man can always change things, Son. That's what makes him different from barnyard critters.
Oh, here you are, Jabez. Lan's, I was worried about you.... Hail in August! The crops will be ruined!
It don't matter!
It don't matter!
What's that you say, Son?
What's that you say, Son?
I say -- it don't matter.
I say -- it don't matter.
Now that's the way to talk, Son! I know you worked hard for that crop. But we'll make out.
Now that's the way to talk, Son! I know you worked hard for that crop. But we'll make out.
Make out? We'll do better than that! I never thought I'd be glad for bad luck, but I am. I never thought I'd be glad of a hail storm at harvest time, but I am! Oh, bless ye the works of the Lord in the hail and the storm and the rain!
Ma -- is she? --
You'll be a father any minute now.
You'll be a father any minute now.
Golly, Ma -- Consarn that music! Shouldn't a-had the harvest festival tonight.
Golly, Ma -- Consarn that music! Shouldn't a-had the harvest festival tonight.
Fiddlesticks! She don't hear it. Got better music to listen to than that. There -- that's what I mean.
You go down and see what's keeping Dorothy.
Sure, Ma.
I want you to fix these fish!
And I say she won't! I'll not have the scorn of God on this place -- with the smell of fish in it, polluting up the Sabbath! And as for you -- let me tell you, young woman...!
My son ... what's the matter?
Ma! ... Where's Mary ... and little Dan'l?
Ma! ... Where's Mary ... and little Dan'l?
Gone with Daniel Webster -- to Marshfield, son.... You told Mary to go--
Ma -- Ma -- it's all right, Ma!
Of course it's all right, son. You had Daniel Webster, didn't ye? Breakfast's ready! I've made a special surprise for Mr. Webster.
Yep -- you can't get around that mortgage. -- I'm sorry, Jabez.
It's all right, Sheriff.
It's all right, Sheriff.
Wish I could really do something for you. But you know Stevens. He'll throw you off your farm tomorrow if you don't pay him tonight.
Wish I could really do something for you. But you know Stevens. He'll throw you off your farm tomorrow if you don't pay him tonight.
Let him try it.

The law is the law. Good-bye, Mary.
Hello, Sheriff.
Hello, Jabez -- I was just talking to Stevens about a little extension on your payment.
Hello, Jabez -- I was just talking to Stevens about a little extension on your payment.
And you didn't get it, hey? Come on, we'll have another talk with him.
It seems such an obvious candidature to us all.
Very well, folks. I accept.
Come in, Sheriff.
Jabez -- seems like I've been hearing talk around. Reverend Harper thinks more Cross Corners folk oughter be in church, Sabbath morning.
Jabez -- seems like I've been hearing talk around. Reverend Harper thinks more Cross Corners folk oughter be in church, Sabbath morning.
Belle, give the Sheriff a cup of rum.
You throw mighty far, Jabez -- almost into the pigsty.
Mary -- Jabez --
Mary -- Jabez --
Coming, Ma.
Well, I guess we won't be going to church today.
I guess we won't.
That is -- if you don't mind changing the lesson, Ma.
Land sakes, I don't mind. I never did hold much with Job, even if he is Scripture. He took on too much to suit me. I don't want to malign the man, but he always sounded to me as if he came from Massachusetts. Yes, Mary, you go ahead and read.
Let her be, son. She'll do all right. You better get yourself straightened out.
Yes, Jabez -- don't worry.
I'll try hard -- I just can't take it all in.
H'm. Hessian gold. Well -- hope it'll do us more good than it did the Hessians.
You know, Ma, why the Squire came to see Jabez?
Yes, Mrs. Slossum told me -- Lucy can't even keep a secret -- Selectman -- my son -- well, who would have thought of that?
What a nice -- and kind girl -- Who is she --?
The new girl -- Jabez says; she is from over the mountain.
The new girl -- Jabez says; she is from over the mountain.
What mountain?
Mary! Ready? First bell's a-ringing!
Yes, Ma -- I'm ready --
She'll do nothing of the kind! She's going to church with me, right away!
Jabez -- for the good of your soul ... please come with us.
Fox hunting -- a Stone going fox hunting on a week day -- and the earth crying out for the touch of him!
Now, Ma -- You just try to set an example for me, and keep hold of yourself.
Now, Ma -- You just try to set an example for me, and keep hold of yourself.
Me? Why, look here, Mary Stone -- I'm worried about you, that's all.
Me? Why, look here, Mary Stone -- I'm worried about you, that's all.
Worried about me! Well, you just stop it!
Worried about me! Well, you just stop it!
What's that?
What's that?
I said you should stop worrying because I've made up my mind!
So you've made up your mind to go to the party.
You aren't angry with me?
You aren't angry with me?
Ah, fiddlesticks -- you are old enough to know what you are doing.
Be sure to let me know if Daniel is over there.
I won't forget.
What are you looking for, Colonel? What's your name?
Martin Van Buren Aldrich and my Pa's the only Democrat in Cross Corners. He said you had horns and a tall, Mr. Webster, but I ain't seen 'em yet.
Martin Van Buren Aldrich and my Pa's the only Democrat in Cross Corners. He said you had horns and a tall, Mr. Webster, but I ain't seen 'em yet.
Well, Martin, I only wear them in Washington -- that's the trouble. But if you ever come down there, I'll show them to you.
Well, Martin, I only wear them in Washington -- that's the trouble. But if you ever come down there, I'll show them to you.
Gee, would you, Mr. Webster? Honest?
Gee, would you, Mr. Webster? Honest?
Of course. And you tell your father for me -- we may be on opposite sides of the fence, but I'm always glad to hear of a man who holds to his own opinions. As long as people do that -- the country's all right. Do you understand, Martin?
Of course. And you tell your father for me -- we may be on opposite sides of the fence, but I'm always glad to hear of a man who holds to his own opinions. As long as people do that -- the country's all right. Do you understand, Martin?
Yes, sir -- I guess I do -- Gee --
It is.
You've got a smart man, Mrs. Stone. Hang onto him.
You've got a smart man, Mrs. Stone. Hang onto him.
-- I'm going to try, Mr. Webster.
Well Mary, it's too bad I didn't know -- I would have given you a real dinner, but with my wife being in Washington -- Have another piece of pie --
No, really, thank you. -- Is Mrs. Webster coming back soon?
No, really, thank you. -- Is Mrs. Webster coming back soon?
Well -- she hardly ever comes here -- she's not the type of woman who cares to live in the country. Yes -- I'm all on my own -- sometimes it makes you feel a little lonely -- Do you mind if I indulge?
Well -- she hardly ever comes here -- she's not the type of woman who cares to live in the country. Yes -- I'm all on my own -- sometimes it makes you feel a little lonely -- Do you mind if I indulge?
Of course not --

No, you wouldn't -- You're not the sort of woman that's afraid of smoke -- or fire -- But now let's talk about your affairs.
No, you wouldn't -- You're not the sort of woman that's afraid of smoke -- or fire -- But now let's talk about your affairs.
Goodness, Mr. Webster, I've done nothing but talk about that all through dinner.
Goodness, Mr. Webster, I've done nothing but talk about that all through dinner.
Yes, you've chatted a lot, woman-like nibbling around the edge -- But, Mary, forgive an old lawyer's legal mind, I don't think you ever once came to the point. And there is a point, isn't there?
Yes, you've chatted a lot, woman-like nibbling around the edge -- But, Mary, forgive an old lawyer's legal mind, I don't think you ever once came to the point. And there is a point, isn't there?
Why -- yes -- it's hard to put it into words, Mr. Webster. There's this matter of little Daniel's schooling and the new house -- and well -- there's something else that's wrong -- it gets worse, year after year -- it's like a shadow growing -- I can't really talk about it, even to Ma -- she puts it all on Jabez and

I've heard some odd things about Jabez lately -- he seems to make the wrong kind of name for himself.

You don't have to defend him to me, Mary -- I've been called names myself.
You see, I don't care if we are rich or poor -- I don't care if we're big or small, all I care about is Jabez. He was the first man I loved. He never used to care about money -- we were poor as Job's turkey, but none of us minded. Now I've seen him drive the poor from the door, and we

Mary -- you've talked to me as you might have talked to your father and I believe he wants me to help you a little. You see, sometimes we think we're licked in this life -- but we weren't put here to be licked. Don't you believe it. Sometimes the shadows seem to get hold of us -- the shadows and the evil --

Oh, could you, Mr. Webster ?
Oh, could you, Mr. Webster ?
And now come on, Mary. I want to show you the all-fired biggest parsnips in the whole United States, raised right here in Marshfield -- of course!
Oh -- Mr. Webster -- I'm so glad you came!
Are you, Mary? Well, I guess I'm glad myself -- seeing as how you feel this way. Party seems to be quite a success. Lots of guests, anyhow.
Jabez ...
Mary -- what love and trust could do for your husband, you've done. And frankly, in a very few moments, this is going to be no place for a lady.

Mr. Webster -- you will help him?

I'll do my best, Mary.
There is nothing like a good old country breakfast. Where's Ma?
She'll be here in a moment. She has a special surprise for you.
Hey there, Dan'l! Black Dan'l!

Why, that's different! Well, boys, I guess we'll knock off. I've got to see a friend.
It's only a short drive, Mr. Webster.
Oh -- it's you again. What do you want?
Oh -- it's you again. What do you want?
With the presidential election coming up, I thought I could be of some help, sir.

Attorney of record for Jabez Stone. Might I ask your name?
Scratch will do for the evening. May I -- join you?
Why, certainly -- but be careful, Mr. Scratch -- Medford rum has an uncanny habit of kicking back, even with old-timers like yourself.
It even kicked back -- once at you, didn't it?

You mean -- a jury trial?

I do! If I can't win this case with a jury, you shall have me, too. If two New Hampshire men aren't a match for the devil, we'd better give this country back to the Indians.

Your Honor -- gentlemen of the jury -- this case need not detain us long. It concerns one thing alone -- the transference, barter and sale of a certain piece of property, to wit, his soul by Jabez Stone. That transference, barter or sale is attested by a deed. I offer that deed in evidence and mark it Exhibit A.
I object.
My congratulations -- as between two gentlemen.
Why, you long-barreled, slab-sided, lantern- jawed, note-shaving crook, be off with you ...
I wanted to give it all to the church.
My money? Why, Mister Stevens? What a quaint idea. Come over to the door. I want to speak to you privately. Stop throwing away that money. We mustn't let people see any softness in you, Mister Stevens.... People take advantage of softness, you know. Come out of there -- I'll give you an extension if you'll forget this stupid repentance idea.

That isn't it. It's ... the loneliness, Mr. Scratch ... the loneliness!

Why don't you?

I can't be honest with them.
I can't be honest with them.
Oh, that's what you want -- well, you can be perfectly honest with Jabez Stone -- now.
I'm John McClane.
Argyle. I'm your limo driver. Hey, nice bag.
Argyle. Don't you take this stuff?
Do I? I'm sorry. You're gonna have to help me, man. This is my first time driving a limo.
Do I? I'm sorry. You're gonna have to help me, man. This is my first time driving a limo.
That's okay. This is my first time riding in one.
If your friend is hot to trot...I know a couple of mama bears. ...Or is he married?
Married.
The girl was off today. Hey, I didn't expect you to sit up front. So, your lady live out here?
The past six months.

Meanwhile, you still live in New York?

You're nosey, you know that, Argyle?

Hey, I'm sorry. When I was a cabdriver, see, people expected a little chit chat, a little eccentricity and comaraderie, I forgot how stuck up you limo guys were, so excuse me.

She had a good job, it turned into a great career.
But meant her moving here.

Closer to Japan. You're fast.

So, why didn't you come?
So, why didn't you come?
'Cause I'm a New York cop who used to be a New York kid, and I got six months backlog of New York scumbags I'm still trying to put behind bars. I don't just get up and move.

You mean you thought she wouldn't make it out here and she'd come crawling on back, so why bother to pack?
Like I said, Argyle...you're fast.
Mind if I play some tunes?
How 'bout some Christmas music?
That is Christmas music.
So, you go on upstairs to the party, your lady sees you, you run into each other's arms. Music comes up, you live happily ever after, that it?
It's corny, but I could live with it.

I'll find someplace.
You're all right, Argyle.
Just remember that when you sign for the tip. They're paying for it, so don't be shy.
I'm Special Agent Johnson of the FBI. This is Agent Johnson...no relation.

Tell that to Mr. Takagi.
Where are you going?

What are you going to do?
What are you going to do?
Hey, I negotiate million dollar deals for breakfast. I can handle these clowns. I want to talk to Hans. Hans! Sprickenzie talk?
John, they're giving me a few minutes to try and talk some sense into you. I know you think you're doing your job, and I can appreciate that, but you're just dragging this thing out. None of us gets out of here until these people can negotiate with the LA police, and they're just not gonna start doing that until you stop messing up
Ellis, what have you told them?
Ellis, what have you told them?
I told them we're old friends and you were my guest at the party.
Ellis...you shouldn't be doing this...
Tell me about it.
John, I think you could get with the program a little. The police are here now. It's their problem. Tell these guys where the detonators are so no one else gets hurt. Hey, I'm putting my life on the line for you buddy...
Don't you think I know that! Put Hans on! Hans, listen to me, that shithead doesn't know what kind of scum you are, but I do --
What am I, a method actor? Hans, babe, put away the gun. This is radio, not television...
That asshole's not my friend! I barely know him! I hate his fucking guts -- -- Ellis, for Christ's sake, tell him you don't mean shit to me --
That asshole's not my friend! I barely know him! I hate his fucking guts -- -- Ellis, for Christ's sake, tell him you don't mean shit to me --
John, how can you say that, after all these years--? John? John?
Hope I'm not interrupting...?
What does he want?
You're very perceptive.
Hey, I read the papers, I watch 60 minutes, I say to myself, these guys are professionals, they're motivated, they're happening. They want something. Now, personally, I don't care about your politics. Maybe you're pissed at the Camel Jockeys, maybe it's the Hebes, Northern Ireland, that's none of my business. I figure, You're here to negotiate, am I right?

You're amazing. You figured this all out already?
Hey, business is business. You use a gun, I use a fountain pen, what's the difference? To put it in my terms, you're here on a hostile takeover and you grab us for some greenmail but you didn't expect a poison pill was gonna be running around the building. Hans, baby...I'm your white knight.

I must have missed 60 Minutes. What are you saying?
I must have missed 60 Minutes. What are you saying?
The guy upstairs who's fucking things up? I can give him to you.
Nothing...
See to Heinrich... Now...you can break the code key...?
I know what you are feeling. But this is not productive --
He was my only brother...my only family! I want blood for my blood. We search...now.
No. Heinrich's team must finish planting the detonators...and Theo needs time on the vault. After the * police come they'll waste hours trying to negotiate...that's when we search * for this man. Until then...we do not alter the plan.
And if he alters it...? *
Hans, he killed by brother --
Karl, I know you want him, but the police are probably on their way. Maybe we can convince them it was all a mistake, but not if they hear gunshots! If you lock him in he'll be neutralized -- now do it! Karl? Karl!
He wasn't lying about Marco: He's thirty stories down on the street. The other man is Heinrich, and I found his body upstairs. And his bag is missing.
He had the detonators! Theo? Theo!
-- you wouldn't let me kill him when I had the chance --
If you'd listened to me he would be neutralized already!
If you'd listened to me he would be neutralized already!
I don't want neutral...I want dead --
'Asian Dawn Movement?'
I read about them in Time magazine. When these Revolutionary Brothers and Sisters are Free, the hostages in this building will be taken to the roof and they will accompany us in helicopters to the Los Angeles International Airport where you will be given further instructions. You have two hours to comply.
It's beautiful. I always enjoyed models as a boy. The exactness, the attention to every foreseeable detail... perfection.
This is what this is about? Out building project in Indonesia? Contrary to what you people think, we're going to develop that region... not 'exploit' it.
Yes...I know about them. The code key is a necessary step in accessing the vault.
You want...money? What kind of terrorists are you?
You want...money? What kind of terrorists are you?
Who said we were terrorists?
The code key, please...?
It's useless to you! There's seven safeguards on our vault, and the code key is only one of them! You'll never get it open!
I don't know it! get on a Goddamn jet to Tokyo and ask the chairman! I'm telling you! You're just going to have to kill me --
Okay.
Bad for your health anyway.
Who are you, then?
Who are you, then?
Just the fly in the ointment, Hans. The monkey in the wrench, the pain in the ass -
Mr. Mystery Guest. Are you still there?
I wouldn't think of leaving, Hans. Unless you want to open the front door...?
I wouldn't think of leaving, Hans. Unless you want to open the front door...?
I'm afraid not. But you have me at a loss -- you know my name, but who are you? Just another American who saw too many movies as a child. Another orphan of a bankrupt culture who thinks he's John Wayne...Rambo... Marshal Dillion.

Do you really think you have a chance against us, Mr. Cowboy?
Hear that? Talk to me, where are my detonators. Where are they or shall I shoot another one? Sooner or later... ...I might get to someone you do care about.
Go fuck yourself.
--ohGodplease -- don't kill me -- don't kill me -- you're one of them, I know it --
Whoa, whoa, easy man. I won't hurt you. Who are you? What are you looking for?
You...you're an American?
Only if New Jersey counts.
You...you don't work for Nakatomi... and if you're not one of them...

Better than being caught with your pants down, right? John McClane.

Hans. Your Hans.
Put it down now.
Put it down now.
That was tricky, with the accent. I bet you do a great Ed Sullivan. Why do you need the detonators, Hans? I already used the explosives.

I'm going to count to three...

'Yippe-ki-yea, mother fucker'? Now you are fucked.
Then there's no reason not to tell it to us.
I told you...
How long?
Thirty minutes to break the code... Two hours for the five mechanicals. The seventh lock...that's out of my hands.
Thirty minutes to break the code... Two hours for the five mechanicals. The seventh lock...that's out of my hands.
If out plan works...the FBI will get rid of it for us.
Yo!
We may have some problems. How is your schedule?
Three down, four to go --
Then don't waste time talking to me.
You better heat up that miracle * you were talking about. We broke through on Number Six, and the Electromagentic came down like a sledgehammer...
* Well have a look at what our friends outside are doing and I'll be right up.
...the circuits that cannot be cut... are cut automatically in reponse to a terrorist incident...You ask for miracles, Theo...I give you the FBI...
When you're hot, you're hot.
Encourage them to be bolder.
The only thing left for them is the City Grid... ...They may not do it.
I...have a request.
Oh? What idiot put you in charge?
Oh? What idiot put you in charge?
You did. You murdered by Boss. Now... They're looking to me. Personally I'd pass on the jab. I don't enjoy being this close to you.
Go on.
We have a pregnant woman out there -- -- relax, she's not due for two weeks, but a marble floor isn't doing her back any good. I'd like permission for her to more to one of the offices where there's a sofa.

Yes, you're right. It will be done.
Mr. Takagi chose his people well, Mrs...?
Gennero. Miss Gennero.
After all your posturing, all your speeches...you're nothing but a common thief.
I'm an exceptional thief, Mrs. McClane. And now that I'm moving up to kidnapping, you should be more polite.
Nice, but one of us is three hours out of sync. I think it's me. Is there a place I can wash up?
Sure. Follow me.
What are you doing?
It's a long story. You know, I think that Ellis has his eye on you.
It's a long story. You know, I think that Ellis has his eye on you.

Ramona...no, Pomona, that's it.
Ramona...no, Pomona, that's it.
Pomona! You'll be in the car the whole time...Look, let's make this easy. I have a spare bedroom. It's not huge, but the kids would love to have you at the house.
They would, huh?
I would too. * They lock eyes for a moment, but it's an intense moment that says a lot about how they still feel about each other.
...I've missed you. *
Especially my name. You must miss it every time you write a check. When did you start calling yourself 'Ms. Gennero'?

I'll be a few minutes. Wait here --

You wife's made for this business. She know how to drive a hard bargain.
Yeah. I remember our first date.
How do you know?

Eugene, at 3:07, this became Federal. Why don't I take it over now?
Okay, okay... we know it's a stickup!
If he moves - blow his guts out... Cover him!
Hey... let him out!
Do what the gentleman says, Howard.
Okay, is the vault open?
I can take care of that.
I must of been outta my mind.
Well, you get your mind right. I'm a Catholic and I don't wanna hurt nobody, but goddamn it, don't you play no games with me. Unnastand?!?
What's the matter with you?
Come on, lemme load you up...
This is it? What am I gonna do with this? Holy shit!

Believe me, I'm on your side.
Believe me, I'm on your side.
My side, shit!
Hello... I'm sorry I can't talk to you right now... I suggest you call during banking hours tomorrow. What is your name?
Gimme the traveler's checks and the register.
Howard, give him the keys...
Gimme the keys to get outta here!
The gun's right on your back...
Give me the keys...
For God's sake, will you please go now? We gave you every nickel we got.
You're goin' outside with me. If there's no cops around, we just split. Otherwise, you go with us.
Hello, Mulvaney here...
Sal, get 'em in the vault.
I swear to God... on my salary, I'm not gonna be any hero...
I took too long.
Where's the back door?
It's locked on the inside. It's through that passageway and to the right.
Now, you -- what's your name?
Mulvaney...
Mulvaney...
You and me are checking the other ways in and out.
Let's go to the back door. How'd that guy get to be a guard?
Well, they go to guard school.
Well, they go to guard school.
To what ... learn how to shoot? They don't get a gun.
To what ... learn how to shoot? They don't get a gun.

You got kids?
I got two kids ... and I'd like to see them again.
I got two kids ... and I'd like to see them again.
Ah, I know! You're being very cooperative. I got no complaint against you whatever; you got bank insurance?

I don't care who you are ... I just want to get you outta here, safe, right?

What if I take you with me?
What if I take you with me?
If you take anybody, please take me.
If you take anybody, please take me.
They'll shoot you; the fucking cops'll shoot you ... they don't give a damn. In spite of that bank insurance. You see what they did in Attica, they shot everybody, the hostages, prisoners, cops, guards, forty-two people they killed, the innocent with the guilty.
You're just a nice guy, Mr. Mulvaney. Only don't fuck around with me, you know what I mean?
I don't fool around with you.
What?
The TV ... they want to talk to you ...
Why the hell did he do that? What the hell did I do?
I guess he didn't appreciate your use of language. They don't speak that way on television. It's a rule. Do you realize you've cut off a valuable source of communication?
You see what we're dealing with? They want me to kill all of you!
What now, Sonny?
What now, Sonny?
Wait a minute ... I've been looking at this all wrong ... Let's look at it the other way ...

I gotta do everything ... I gotta pay for the pizza ... I'm workin' on it, do you know what I mean? I'm workin' on it ... Jesus Christ!

You know, you remind me of my 19- year-old brother - only he's got his hair down to his knees - he looks like something that eats berries and roots out of the ground. God forbid I should say something to him like, 'Listen, if you ever smoke marijuana, just remember that it's illegal' and he storms outta the house. You rob a bank,

It's the FBI. He wants to come in.
Have him walk in backwards.
Sal?

Our own special bus.
Our own special bus.
How do you know it's for us?
How do you know it's for us?
Duh. The cool kids sit in the back of the bus. Here, every row is in the back. We're all cool!
Nope. I was right.
Wanna bet?
Uh oh. Captain Rob's always been my partner.
Sucks for you.
Sucks for you.
Who's your partner?
Who's your partner?
I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
Well... Uh...maybe... jeez, how can I say this... you and I could...perhaps ...maybe...uh... partner up?
Well... Uh...maybe... jeez, how can I say this... you and I could...perhaps ...maybe...uh... partner up?
You and me? Dream on, desperado.

Oh. Sorry. You're right, field trip partner is a big commitment.
Oh. Sorry. You're right, field trip partner is a big commitment.
I'm kidding! Of course I'll be your partner.
That's a cow, Harry.
Well, I could go for a tall glass of polar bear milk right now.
Sorry about that Harry, first time I've brought a friend up there. You okay?
Yea!
Who cares? Chicks are for fags.
I think she wants me to come over to put me into the right position to check out her delicates, what ever that means.

Some what?

You know... She's gonna be all over you like a barrel of monkeys, with her tight shirt and short skirt... Eeeww, it's so faggy I can't even talk about it.
You know... She's gonna be all over you like a barrel of monkeys, with her tight shirt and short skirt... Eeeww, it's so faggy I can't even talk about it.
Come on, Lloyd. You must know someone I can talk to.
Come on, Lloyd. You must know someone I can talk to.
Sure I do. On one condition.

You can't marry my mom.
You can't marry my mom.
It's really not up to you, Harry. But we just want you to feel like you're part of the decision.
It's really not up to you, Harry. But we just want you to feel like you're part of the decision.
Shut up!
Shut up!
Alright, if you really want to go down this road, well girl's like chocolate.
Oh hey Lloyd, why are you here?
Just wanted to see how your doing.
Just wanted to see how your doing.
I kinda screwed things up.

I'm sure you're overreacting.

Okay, I saw this in a movie once. Open the dining room window and follow my lead. Say what I say.
Good - thanks Lloyd! I'll meet you downstairs, I gotta find some clothes.
HARRY, can you hear me?
Yes.
You have beautiful eyes.
You have beautiful eyes.
Hey, where did you come from?
Hey, where did you come from?
Do you want me to pet your head?
I bet you want your head scratched.
I bet you want your head scratched.

Don't snap at me like that. You're lucky I don't punch you right in the face.
Don't snap at me like that. You're lucky I don't punch you right in the face.
Now what are you staring at, you ugly monkey?
What are you staring at, you ugly monkey?
Sure, I like a woman with some meat on her bones.
So, have you given him "some" yet?
LLOYD, what are you doing? That's JESSICA and... my mom.
HARRY, this is my fantasy! I suggest you leave - before I imagine something horrible.
HARRY, this is my fantasy! I suggest you leave - before I imagine something horrible.
But-
But-
HARRY!
HARRY!
You're right. Hey, thanks for the jet pack. Your fantasies are so much cooler than mine. Bye Mom.
HARRY! I found the treasure!
Go away, assface.
Go away, assface.
Did you hear what I said? The treasure! Like on your map!
Did you hear what I said? The treasure! Like on your map!
Yeah, right. Why don't you show it to your "girlfriend"?
Yeah, right. Why don't you show it to your "girlfriend"?
JESSICA and I are through. I couldn't stand being with her knowing you liked her. It wasn't worth our friendship. Oh, and she also has a boyfriend.
JESSICA and I are through. I couldn't stand being with her knowing you liked her. It wasn't worth our friendship. Oh, and she also has a boyfriend.
Do you hear something, Captain Rob?
Do you hear something, Captain Rob?
Captain Rob came back?
Captain Rob came back?
Yeah, he does sound like a rat fink.
Yeah, he does sound like a rat fink.
Hey, there's no reason to use that kind of language!
Hey, there's no reason to use that kind of language!
Good one, Captain Rob. He does look like a you-know-what.
Good one, Captain Rob. He does look like a you-know-what.
Oh, telling inside jokes now, are we? That's it. You're out of the cool crowd. Next time Turk's passing out wedgies, you ain't gettin' one.
HARRY, would you like to share with the rest of us what's so funny?
You wouldn't get it. Just a private joke between best friends.
No one knows?
Me, me, me!
Me, me, me!
The answer is George Jefferson.
By the way, did Captain Rob mention how I beat the crap out of him this afternoon?
No. What happened?
No. What happened?
Nothing. Why, whaddya hear?
A raft.
A blimp.
A blimp.
A turd.
George Washington!
Who?
Who?
Hello, he only invented money!
Wow, we built a whole float in one afternoon. And now the reward.
What do you mean? We can't go in there or we'll be "it".
If you have to ask, you don't know.
Yeah, that's why I asked.
Yeah, that's why I asked.
You certainly did.
You certainly did.
I know I did.
I know I did.
Sorry, no further questions.
You're it.
Am not.
Am not.
Are, too.
Are, too.
D2.
It's okay. I want the rush.
No. Look.
Hey, it's Jessica.
That must be her boyfriend's car.
PRINCIPAL COLLINS is her boyfriend!
Now it makes total sense why she didn't want him to know we were in his office the other night.
No wonder we both struck out with her. Who can compete with the sexual power of the man who occupies the highest office in the land?
He's like the Pope. Like we're gonna snake a girl away from the Pope.
He's like the Pope. Like we're gonna snake a girl away from the Pope.
Hey, let's go spy on them.
Cute puppy.
He must be on his way to pee out a fire.
Hey, look. Ice cream.
You thinking what I'm thinking?
You found my treasure? Why didn't you tell me.
Three words. I did. But you were all mad at me and wouldn't listen.
Three words. I did. But you were all mad at me and wouldn't listen.
Well, I'm listening now.
Well, I'm listening now.
Me, too. This is my favorite part of the tape.
You know Lloyd, the real treasure is our friendship.
How true. But I still feel I deserve more than you do of this treasure. I mean, I found it.
How true. But I still feel I deserve more than you do of this treasure. I mean, I found it.
But my mom gave me the map.
But my mom gave me the map.
I lugged it all over town!

I made the polar bear pants.

But I ate your Mom's pie.
But I ate your Mom's pie.
I... found that rock.
I... found that rock.
It was a diamond and you swallowed it.
Enough! Look what this cursed chest is doing to us.
I don't know who we are anymore.
I have no idea - it's full of files and documents and tapes.
Do you know what this means?
Hey Lloyd. This looks like another one of your mix tapes.
Maybe the pirate who buried this treasure chest made it. Put it on.
That makes total sense. The treasure chest was in his office. Which means Principal Collins is a pirate! I'm surprised Captain Rob never mentioned him.
That's because Captain Rob is not a pirate. We've been through this.
What was it Jessica wanted us to do with this chest again?
Something about showing the world what Principal Collins has done.
Something about showing the world what Principal Collins has done.
Right. She's so proud of her boyfriend.
What? What did we do?
We never thanked him for giving us our Special Needs class.
We never thanked him for giving us our Special Needs class.
That's what Jessica was talking about!
That's what Jessica was talking about!
She wants us to show the world what a great guy Principal Collins is.
She wants us to show the world what a great guy Principal Collins is.
And like she said, do it before the parade.
A float!
That's it. Build him a float for the Thanksgiving Day parade!
HARRY, we found the real thing to be thankful for. Screw George Washington!
Yes. Screw George Washington. Just like Marilyn Monroe did.
Ready Lloyd?
Put a fork in me Harry, lets get started.
Wait, wait!
HARRY, are we gonna build this thing or not?
HARRY, are we gonna build this thing or not?
LLOYD, what I'm saying is we may already have what we want.
Guys, this is much better.
PRINCIPAL COLLINS is a greater American than George Washington will ever be.
Oh my god. Can you believe your ears?
Yeah! No more clicks and whistles! Now she speaks perfect English!
Yeah! No more clicks and whistles! Now she speaks perfect English!
You're a great teacher, Lloyd.
Start the tape, Lloyd.
Roger that, Wilco.
Oh, good. There's Jessica.
How could she miss this? This whole salute to Collins was her idea.
Hey there goes Principal Collins!
He's so modest. Probably embarrassed by all the attention.
He's so modest. Probably embarrassed by all the attention.
Well, that's too bad, this is his day.
Oh my God! She's two-timing PRINCIPAL COLLINS!
And with that complete loser
Ya know Harry, I think this whole experience has soured me on women.
Yeah, we should never let a woman come between us again.
Yeah, we should never let a woman come between us again.
I don't think that'll happen. We've learned a valuable lesson we won't ever forget.
Hold up. First, we have to decide who gets who, remember? No more competition?
Right.
Right.
Okay. Which one do you want?
The one on the left.
Damn! What are the odds?
Damn! What are the odds?
What?
What?
That's the one I wanted.
She's one of a kind.
Try one in a million!
Try one in a million!
Well, what should we do?
You take her.
No Lloyd. Chicks are for fags - I'm not going to do it.
Sorry, Charlie.
Hey, where'd you go?
Beats me. It's Jessica's Dad - she said he's really anal.
That's gross.
That's gross.
I know.
MS. HELLER, mind if I tag along on your field trip? I'm thinking of doing a story on your special needs class.
I'm not interested. Not after the smear story you did on my chicken sushi.
I'm not interested. Not after the smear story you did on my chicken sushi.
Well, when 200 students are hospitalized with stomach cramps I think it's newsworthy.

You mean the lunch room?
I thought I told you to get lost.
Look Ms. Heller, there's something fishy here, and I don't think it's Friday's special.
Look Ms. Heller, there's something fishy here, and I don't think it's Friday's special.
I wouldn't know. Being that I'm just the teacher and all.
You had some questions.
Last year Toby was in A.P. English. And Lewis won the Science Fair. What are they doing in Special Needs?
Last year Toby was in A.P. English. And Lewis won the Science Fair. What are they doing in Special Needs?
Poor question. Too wordy. A good question gets right to the point. Example, where's my chest?
Poor question. Too wordy. A good question gets right to the point. Example, where's my chest?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Oh I think you do.
My parents are going to wonder where I am.
One phone call from the principal will take care of that, my dear.
So what did you say to my parents on the phone?
Not to expect you tonight.
I'm going to ask you one last time and if I don't get an answer, I don't even want to think about the consequences which would be frightening to say the least. Where's my chest, Jessica?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Well, what have we here? It appears be a tape.
That's not your tape.
That's not your tape.
Then where did you get this not my tape.
Then where did you get this not my tape.
THAT'S NOT YOUR TAPE.
THAT'S NOT YOUR TAPE.
Don't play with me dear, you're way out of your league.
TURK, leave him alone.
TURK, leave him alone. You're coming too.
TURK, what are you doing here?
Special Needs class.
Special Needs class.
Being a jerk doesn't make you special.
Being a jerk doesn't make you special.
You're just jealous.
You're just jealous.
And, Ching Chong, you're not a Special Needs kid. You're just a foreign exchange student.
Hey, Turk rescued you from the nerd. You're in!
I'll talk to you later.
HARRY, I heard Collins has you in some kind of special class.
If dou're trying to get in, dou're doo late.
If dou're trying to get in, dou're doo late.
Oh no, I know that class isn't for me. But I'm happy for you guys.
Why ith dat newth?
This school's never had one before. I'd like to talk to you and all your special friends.
Yes, what?
Don't answer me. Say what I say.
Well I was born in St. Louis.
Do you want me to pet your head?
What are you doing here?
Checking up on my friend, Harry.
Checking up on my friend, Harry.
Oh Harry's doing just fine, he's just about to open up.

HARRY and I have been talking about school. In fact, I want to ask you something.
I know, you want go for a ride.
Where'd that come from? He holds up a giant key chain.
Come on, I live with the janitor. I have a key to every room in the school.
Come on, I live with the janitor. I have a key to every room in the school.
So could you get us into the principal's office?
So could you get us into the principal's office?
Principal's office? Yeah, I guess I can swing that.
So, when can we do it?
Tomorrow night?
Oh, baby, you're the bestest.
Oh, go on.
Well, something stinks.
Maybe it's this mix tape I made you. Or maybe these flowers. He gives Jessica the flowers and tape.
Maybe it's this mix tape I made you. Or maybe these flowers. He gives Jessica the flowers and tape.
Uh, thanks. God I'm so excited! So, are you ready to take me to the principal's office? He whips out the key, she takes it.
Uh, thanks. God I'm so excited! So, are you ready to take me to the principal's office? He whips out the key, she takes it.
So no small talk? Good, 'cause I don't know how to make that. Yep. Small talk. Not for me. Not a fan. Got any hobbies? How 'bout this weather?
What are you doing?
Let's just do it and get out of here.
I'm so close I can feel it.
Me too. I'm almost there.
Me too. I'm almost there.
That's it. I'm done.
That's it. I'm done.
That was fast. Well, did you at least enjoy it?
That was fast. Well, did you at least enjoy it?
No, it was a complete waste of time.
No, it was a complete waste of time.
This is so embarrassing, it's never happened before. Well, maybe a couple of times, but I was alone.
That's my boyfriend.
Boyfriend? What about all that talk about riding my waxer?
Boyfriend? What about all that talk about riding my waxer?
Thanks, Lloyd. But I didn't find what I was looking for. Oh can you do me a favor and clean up? Collins can't know we were here.
HARRY! Lloyd! You guys are a mess.
Looks like the best man won.
... If I may quote the twentieth century poet - Joe Piscahpo: You look Marvelous...
LLOYD, when we were in Principal Collins's office, did you see any kind of chest?
LLOYD, when we were in Principal Collins's office, did you see any kind of chest?
HARRY's treasure chest? Sure. I know where that is.
Don't worry about me, I'll be fine. I can take care of myself and I'm getting the story every high school reporter dreams of.
"My dream date with Principal Collins."
He's going to be in jail for a long time.
Principal of jail. Wow. What a promotion.
Well I need to get a job and you're telling me that if I join up - I can really come and go whenever I want?
You were born free and free you should remain.
Do I know you?
Duh. I'm in your class at school.
Duh. I'm in your class at school.
Oh my God, it's really you. You're HARRY's friend, right?
Oh my God, it's really you. You're HARRY's friend, right?
I don't know if you'd call us "friends"...
I don't know if you'd call us "friends"...
You really are a pirate.
You really are a pirate.
Can you believe it?
Can you believe it?
So I'm an "arrrrrs-hole", eh Captain Rob?
So I'm an "arrrrrs-hole", eh Captain Rob?
What are you talking about?
Hello, little orphan boy. What happened to you?
Skateboard.
What? It's nothing, the cast comes off in six weeks.
Of course it does. Obviously in denial. Maybe we can help.
How much homework is there?
That's the downside. There is none.
That's the downside. There is none.
Wait a minute. I can spend the whole year in a class taught by the lunch lady? Can I bring my girlfriend?

It's too close to call. Okay next contest, now lets...
Senior year. My little boy. Who woulda thunk it? You're a good kid, Lloyd. I don't say it enough, but I'm proud of you son.
Thanks, Pop.
LLOYD, may I see you a minute?
Class, please study on your own. There seems to be a family emergency because there's no other reason why my father would interrupt me WHILE I'M WORKING!
What are you crazy kids doing in my tool shed?
We're not crazy. We're "special". PRINCIPAL COLLINS wants us to have our own classroom!
We're not crazy. We're "special". PRINCIPAL COLLINS wants us to have our own classroom!
My boy's special, well how about that. I knew you were different.
My boy's special, well how about that. I knew you were different.
So I guess you'll need a new spot for your moonshine.
So I guess you'll need a new spot for your moonshine.
I reckon so.
Your assignment is to pick the class. Find some other students just as special as you.
Will that be on the midterm?
Will that be on the midterm?
No.
Sorry, Ms. Heller. I think they're used to me teaching.
People! Come on. "Parade" float.
That's not bad. How about a float of George Washington crossing the Delaware?
Or maybe crossing a river!
Obviously.
So miss snoopy reporter girl, it appears that you've snooped yourself into a corner and snoopcuffed yourself to a desk. Whose wearing the Coconut bra now?
Let's go Margie. The museum ain't going to teach itself.
Museum huh, haven't been there since my husband left me. I love art.
Looking for a scoop, huh? I'll give you a scoop... of short bus. Lose her!
Loser... oh yeah he was a loser alright. A big loser.
Loser... oh yeah he was a loser alright. A big loser.
What?
What?
He was a big loser! What are you deaf!?
He was a big loser! What are you deaf!?
Uh, no and I don't appreciate...turn down here!
That's great, now make a left, then straight!
Oh, yeah he was straight all right, just wasn't very good in the sack. I used to give him directions. Higher, lower, faster, harder, small circles, do the alphabet. Useless.
Left here! Left!
You bet I left him, took the dog and we was history.
Ha! Too big to make the turn!
No, it actually fit quite nicely. Well, except for the fact that it wasn't really as long as it was wide.
I think you did it.
Damn right I did it. Went back and set the house on fire, his little floozy testified in court - and I ended up doing ten years at Rikers, got my teeth knocked out by Mike the Dyke.
Damn right I did it. Went back and set the house on fire, his little floozy testified in court - and I ended up doing ten years at Rikers, got my teeth knocked out by Mike the Dyke.

Sure you can. We gotta nail this guy. You'll be fine.
Sure you can. We gotta nail this guy. You'll be fine.
Collins can be a pretty crafty guy, what do I do if he smells the trap.

Yeah, I get it. Don't worry I studied acting at the police academy just let me do the talking and you'll be fine.
I am strong!
Yes you are.
I can turn on all the faucets in my house. Even the hose.
But we don't drink from the house do we.
... and, Principal Collins, you'll be pleased to know that this year Wednesdays are "South of the Border" days. We'll serve a spicy tuna tamale along with a cheese quesadilla.
Good. Good. Good. Well, that's good.
God, I've missed you.
And I you.
You know honey, I've finally figured out a way of bilking enough money from the school to get us that condo in Waikiki.
How baby-cakes? You've done it all.
How baby-cakes? You've done it all.
Small potatoes. This one is big time. This is visionary. This idea is genius.
It's the big potato.
Yes, it's the big potato. Just have a look at this.
Anyway, the state is giving a hundred thousand dollars in his name to every school that has a Special Needs class.
Oh, this is fantastic. So all we have to do is kill this Moffit guy and we get all the money!
Oh, this is fantastic. So all we have to do is kill this Moffit guy and we get all the money!
No. No. That's not it. We don't kill him. We don't kill anybody. But I like the way you're thinking. You're focused and you're trying to follow. No, what we need to do is start a fake Special Needs class.
No. No. That's not it. We don't kill him. We don't kill anybody. But I like the way you're thinking. You're focused and you're trying to follow. No, what we need to do is start a fake Special Needs class.

We start our own class?
Maybe someday. Aloha cold weather, aloha hot weather.
You said "aloha" twice.
Aloha means hello and goodbye.
Aloha means hello and goodbye.
Oh wow. Look at you.
Times two.
I think you'll make a good teacher.

Wait a minute, I think I know who stole it.

Why don't you see to it the kids are ready for the parade tomorrow. I have to pay somebody a little visit.
So the chest is still out there somewhere.
Yes. So as soon as Zimmer shows up, we'll get our check and blow this pop stand before anyone finds out anything.
Yes. So as soon as Zimmer shows up, we'll get our check and blow this pop stand before anyone finds out anything.
This band sounds terrible.
I sold all the wind instruments. Hawaiian Air, business class. And you like that new fur coat?
Love it!
Love it!
Well there's a reason why that mascot isn't a stallion anymore.
This is horse?
No... no it's not horse, you see I sold the horse.
My Lord!
Piter.
The Atreides will be leaving Caladan soon, Baron, and I have here your answer from Duke Leto.
What does Leto say, Piter?
What does Leto say, Piter?
He wishes to inform you that Vendetta -- as he puts it, using the ancient tongue, the art of Kanly -- is still alive. He does not wish to meet or speak with you.
He wishes to inform you that Vendetta -- as he puts it, using the ancient tongue, the art of Kanly -- is still alive. He does not wish to meet or speak with you.
I made my peace gesture... the forms of Kanly have been obeyed.
It was Feyd? It was Feyd! Where is the ducal signet ring? I must have his ring.
The ring?... he was brought to us as is, Baron. I...
The ring?... he was brought to us as is, Baron. I...
You killed the doctor too soon, you fool!
So you are Dr. Kynes, the Imperial Ecologist?
I prefer the more ancient term, planetologist... Noble Born.
I prefer the more ancient term, planetologist... Noble Born.
This is my son, Paul.
I understand we have you to thank for these stillsuits, Doctor.
They are Fremen suits. I hope they fit well, my lord.
My thanks.
With your permission...
What happens now?
The carryall will come and lift off the spice harvester. Try and get in close over the harvester... you'll find this interesting Sire. -- The Duke accelerates the ornithopter in the direction of the harvester. Paul can SEE...
What's that you're saying?
Nothing.
A Third Stage Guild Navigator will be here within minutes!
We felt his presence.
We felt his presence.
I shall want telepathy during his visit and a report when we're finished.

Forced spice evolution of humans changes many things.... I must sit close to him.

He will not permit anyone but me to see him. You must be outside this room.... Do what you can.
He will not permit anyone but me to see him. You must be outside this room.... Do what you can.
I am your Truthsayer, my lord... He is here, my lord.
Yes, my Lord.
We are alone...
We have just folded space from Ix...
Yes?... How was your journey?
Yes?... How was your journey?
Many machines on Ix... new machines.
Many machines on Ix... new machines.
Oh yes? -- NAVIGATOR Better than those on Richesse.. You are transparent... I see many things... I see plans within plans.
I see two Great Houses -- House Atreides, House Harkonnen -- feuding... I see you behind it.
Yes.
You must share with us. -- EMPEROR The Atreides house is building a secret army!... using a technique unknown to us... a technique involving sound. The Duke is becoming more popular in the Landsraad... he could threaten me.... I have ordered House Atreides to occupy Arrakis to mine the spice... thus replacing their enemies the Harkonnens.... House Atreides will not refuse because of the
So the Harkonnens will rid you of House Atreides...
So the Harkonnens will rid you of House Atreides...
Yes.
Can you hear me?... If this visit has anything to do with spice... -- The Guild Navigator shudders and swishes quite violently in his tank.
LISTEN TO ME!! The spice must flow... the spice has given me accelerated evolution for four thousand years... it has enabled you to live two hundred years... the spice helps make the sapho juice, which gives the red-lipped mentats the ability to be living computers... the secret side of spice... the water of life.
I can assure you...
Do not interrupt!!! Do not speak lightly of the spice... ONE SMALL POINT...
So, this is Leto the Just...
I hope I made myself clear. You may call him "The Duke," "My lord," or "Sire." And there is a more ancient term you might keep in mind -- "Noble Born."
I hope I made myself clear. You may call him "The Duke," "My lord," or "Sire." And there is a more ancient term you might keep in mind -- "Noble Born."
Play out your little comedy while you can off-worlders...
The Duke is to be addresses as... -- Kynes comes forward and adjusts the Duke's suit, checking seals and pulling on straps.
Basically...
Basically...
Sire!
Yes, Sire.
It's a high-efficiency filter and heat exchange system. Perspiration passes through the first layer and is gathered in the second. The salt is separated. Breathing and walking provide the pumping action. The reclaimed water circulates to catchpockets from which you can drink through this tube at your neck. Urine and feces are processed in the thigh pads. Should you be in the open desert,
Dust cloud ahead, Sire.
That's it... spice mining... no other cloud quite like it. See the spotters over it? They're watching for wormsign... the telltale sand waves. Seismic probes on the surface, too Sire... worms can travel too deep for their waves to show... Looks like a good patch of spice.
No music. I'm packing this for the crossing. Shield practice.
Shield practice? Gurney... we had practice -- this morning..... I'm not in the mood.
Shield practice? Gurney... we had practice -- this morning..... I'm not in the mood.
Not in the mood?! Mood's a thing for cattle and love play... not fighting.
Not in the mood?! Mood's a thing for cattle and love play... not fighting.
I'm sorry Gurney.
I'm sorry Gurney.
Not sorry enough.
What's gotten into Gurney? He's not faking. Paul presses forward and the fight moves quickly around the room. The smell of ozone grows stronger as the shields hit and SPARK off one another. Paul directs a parry downwards, turns, and leads Gurney against the table, plunging at just the right moment to pin Gurney against the table top with his blade right at Gurney's
Is this what you seek?
Is this what you seek?
Good... the slow blade penetrates the shield... but look down.
We'd have joined each other in death. However, you did seem to finally get the "mood".
Would you really have drawn my blood?
Would you really have drawn my blood?
If you'd fought one whit below your abilities I'd have scratched you a good one.
Things have been so serious here lately.
Yes. I sensed the play in you lad, but this can no longer be play. Tomorrow we leave for Arrakis! Arrakis is real. The Harkonnens are real.
You've no need of your weapons with me Gurney Halleck.
Paul!! Paul!!
Paul!! Paul!!
Don't you trust your own eyes.
Don't you trust your own eyes.
They said you were dead. They said...
Gurney... I see Thufir Hawat among the captives. Let him stand free.
My Lord?
My Lord?
Let him stand free!
This is a Harkonnen animal. Let me, please, my Lord.
The Emperor's blade.
Perhaps these are the ones Mapes told us of.
Are you trained in the ways of the desert?

No, but many consider my training valuable.
No, but many consider my training valuable.
I will take the boy-man... he shall have sanctuary in my tribe... -- A LOW NOTE on a dip stick is blown by one of the Fremen tribe. Jessica shifts, Paul sees it, and just as Stilgar begins a reach for his weapon, Jessica turns, slashes out, utters a SOUND, whirls again and with rock behind her holds Stilgar helpless in front of her
Stop! Get back!! She has the weirding way. Why didn't you tell us! Great gods... if you can do this to the strongest of us you're worth ten times your weight of water. As a leader of my people I give you my bond: teach us this weirding way and you both shall have sanctuary. Your water shall mingle with our water.
Then I will teach you our way of battle.... you have the word bond of a Bene Gesserit.
Sayyadina. Our Reverend Mother tells me she is too old... She has been calling through space and time for you to come and let her rest. She asks that you pass within.
They want me to take the Water of Life... the Truthsayer drug... so dangerous, yet... we must move swiftly if we're to secure our place among these Fremen. I will try to pass within.

Death may be the result.... Are you sure?

I must do this for Paul, but what of my unborn child?
You know the ancient tongues?
I know the Bhotani Jib and Chakobsa, all the hunting languages.

As the legend says.
As the legend says.
That's it! The Missionaria Protectiva has been here planting protective legends against a day of Bene Gesserit need. And that day has come. I must play out this sham. I know the Dark things and the way of the Great Mother. Miseces prejin.
Do you know this my lady?
It could only be one thing.... It's a crysknife.
It could only be one thing.... It's a crysknife.
Say it not lightly... Do you know its meaning?
Say it not lightly... Do you know its meaning?
Here is why this Fremen has taken service with me, to ask that one question. Delay is as dangerous as the wrong answer. Shadout is Chakobsa... knife, in Chakobsa is... maker of death. It's a maker...
Maker?... Maker is the key word... the tooth of the worm? That was close... Did you think that I, knowing the mysteries of the Great Mother, would not know the maker?
My lady, when one has lived with prophecy for so long, the moment of revelation is a shock.
Paul, this is the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam. She is going to... observe you... Please... -- REVEREND MOTHER Jessica, you know it must be done. I enjoin you to stand guard at the door and practice the meditation of peace.
Your Reverence.
Your Reverence.
What does she fear? What about my Father?
What does she fear? What about my Father?
Paul... please, Paul... listen to the Reverend Mother and do what she tells you.
Don't touch my mother...
Oh great mother! He's trying the voice. The Reverend Mother said it could save him.
Remove her gag!
Excellent!
I can't maintain any altitude... we'll never reach the safety of rock. Maybe that small rock.
Where are we do you think?
Where are we do you think?
The South Polar regions... the forbidden area. We must make it to that rock...
A million deaths are not enough for Yueh...
Where are my feelings... I feel for no one...
Listen to me!... you wanted to know about my dreams... and I've just had a waking dream... do you know why?... -- JESSICA Calm yourself/
The spice! It's in everything here. The air, the soil, the food... It's like the Truthsayer drug..... It's a poison!!!! You knew the spice would change me. But thanks to your teachings it's changed my consciousness. I can see it... I can see it.

Is he....?
You carry my unborn sister in your womb!
You carry my unborn sister in your womb!
He knows.
He knows.
You and your Bene Gesserit sisterhood... I'm not your Kwisatz Haderach... I'm something different, something unexpected! I'm a seed. I am so much more... You don't begin to know me...
It's further than I thought... a worm is sure to come.... I'll plant a thumper, that should divert it. -- Paul moves off into the shadows. Suddenly, Jessica SEES a burst of LIGHTNING illuminate the mountain of rock in the distant and the vast dunes before them.
...the night is a tunnel... a hole into tomorrow... if we're to have a tomorrow...
Remember... walk without rhythm and we won't attract a worm... it'll go to the thumper.
I'm ready.
Run!
I can't... I can't.
Cinnamon... the spice! Do you smell it?
Yes...
Yes...
I know the secret. The worm is the spice... the spice is the worm.
What's happened?... Why did it leave?
Someone started another thumper.... We're not alone.
Man-carved steps.
Yes...
Stop him yourself.
You saw a part of what the race needs in the beginning. In time you perverted the truth. You sought to control human breeding and intermix a select few according to a selfish master plan. How little you understand.
Are you a Fremen?
I am a servant of the His Majesty the Emperor. I have served His Majesty on Arrakis long enough for my eyes to change.

He's hiding something.
You've worn a stillsuit before?
No.
No.
Your suit is fitted desert fashion. Who told you how to do that?
Your suit is fitted desert fashion. Who told you how to do that?
No one. It... seemed the proper way.

That it is. He shall know your ways as if born to them.
Will we see a worm?
Where there is spice and spice mining there are always worms.

Always?
Always?
Always.
Always.
Why do they come?
Why do they come?
To protect their territory. Vibrations attract them. -- PAUL I've registered him now... a knife is a sheath on his left arm... He's strong... a person born to command... He's hiding many things. Is there a relationship between the worms and the spice?
Spice!... pure un-refined spice!
Bless the Maker and his water... Bless the coming and going of him. May his passage cleanse the world.
Liet?
You are about to witness something few have seen -- watch! Watch!
You have strength... real strength... You shall be known as Usul, which is the strength of the base of the pillar. This is your secret name in our troop. But you must choose the name of manhood which we will call you openly.
What do you call the mouse shadow in the second moon?

We call that one Muad'dib.

Could I be known as Paul Muad'dib?
Could I be known as Paul Muad'dib?
You are Paul Muad'dib, and your mother shall be a Sayyadina among us.... We welcome you.
Water on Arrakis!!! I have seen this place in a dream. A treasure.
Greater than treasure, Usul. We have thousands of such caches. Only a few of us know them all. When we have enough... we shall change the face of Arrakis. Listen!...
The Water of Life.
The most lethal poison in the Universe.
My own name is a killing word. Will it be a healing word as well?
Usul... these are fifteen of our fiercest fighters to serve you as your guard... the Fedaykin.
We surprised a band of smugglers.
Too bad... thought they were Harkonnen.
Long live the fighters!
Long live the fighters!
What's in the box?
Pain.
The Voice again.
I hold at your neck the gom jabbar. Don't pull away or you'll feel that poison. A Duke's son must know about many poisons -- this one kills only animals.

Are you suggesting a Duke's son is an animal?
Let us say I suggest you may be human. Your awareness may be powerful enough to control your instincts. Your instincts will be to remove your hand from the box. If you do so you will die. You will feel an itching -- there... see? Now the itching becomes burning... heat, upon heat, upon heat.

It burns.
It burns.
SILENCE... SILENCE.
SILENCE... SILENCE.
I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear... I will permit it to pass over me and through me. -- The Reverend Mother moves her face up to his. Her ancient face with its metal teeth gleaming inches away breathes hotly. She is smiling.

You feel the flesh crisping?
THE PAIN!
NO!! ENOUGH!! Kull wahad! No woman child ever withstood that much. I must have wanted you to fail. Take your hand out of the box and look at it, young human.... Do it!
Pain by nerve induction... A human can resist any pain. Our test is crisis and observation.
I see the truth of it. -- REVEREND MOTHER Could he be the one?... Maybe... but will he be ours to control? You know when people speak the truth?
Your mother wants you to tell me about your dreams. I only want to know one thing.... Do they come true?
Not all of them... I know which ones will.

I have heard of it. -- REVEREND MOTHER It is very dangerous... very painful. The Bene Gesserit sisterhood drink it to see within.... There is a place terrifying to us... to women. It is said a man will come... the Kwisatz Haderach... he will go where we cannot... Many men have tried...

Did they try and fail?
Did they try and fail?
They tried and died.... Jessica!
I sense your teachings in him. Ignore the regular order of training. His safety requires The Voice.
I've heard enough of my safety... What about my father?... I heard you talking. You speak as if he was dead. Well, he isn't!
Well he isn't... and he won't die... Tell me he won't die!
What can be done has been done.

Don't try your powers on me. Try looking into that place where you dare not look. You'll find me there staring back at you!! You Bene Gesserit have waited ninety generations to produce the one person your schemes required. Here I stand. But... I will never be yours.
Stop him, Jessica!
You mustn't speak of...
SILENCE!
I heard you, Dr. Yueh and Gurney coming down the hall.
Those sounds could be imitated.
Those sounds could be imitated.
I'd know the difference.
Yes. Perhaps he would at that.
My father sent you to test me. Music then?
Many dangers exist on Arrakis. For one, we know the Harkonnens would not have given up their CHOAM company contract so easily.
The Harkonnens are our enemies, yes... but behind them, I suspect, is the Emperor. -- THUFIR You will make a formidable Duke!
Now remember... the first step in avoiding a trap is knowing of its existence.
I know. But if it is a trap then why are we going?
I know. But if it is a trap then why are we going?
We have our new army. Dr. Yueh, put the weirding module on him.
Greetings. I am the Count.
Greetings. I am Slick Slomopavitz, Seeker of Adventure.
Say, that's a funny place to sleep.
It is my home.
It is my home.
Oh, tract housing, huh? I guess I shouldn't complain about my duplex in Burbank. What a dump. Some places have a Murphy bed, this place has a Murphy <u>shower</u>. I still don't know where to hang the towels!
Uh, beg to differ.
"Beg to differ?!" Hey, I'm talkin' about my duplex in Burbank!
"Beg to differ?!" Hey, I'm talkin' about my duplex in Burbank!
Uh, Greetings. I am the Count...
Mr. <u>Lugosi</u>! It is an unparalleled privilege to meet you. Allow me to introduce myself... I am CRISWELL!
It's a pleasure...
It's a pleasure...
Ah, cheer up! Don't lose heart over what happened tonight. I predict that your next project will be an outstanding success!
Bring me two more Beefeater martinis. Eddie will have another whiskey, Dagmar's a Rum-and-coke, Moustapha and King are chablis -- hey Bela, would you like a wine?
No. I never drink -- wine.
So <u>you</u> sleep in coffins?!
Yes. There is nothing more comfortable.
Yes. There is nothing more comfortable.
I can't believe this! <u>I</u> sleep in coffins!
I can't believe this! <u>I</u> sleep in coffins!
No.
No.
YES! My father ran a mortuary -- it's an old habit!
Eddie, where are we? We passed that carwash twenty minutes ago.
I predict we're lost.
Excuse me, Mr. Lugosi??
I told you, I don't want any of your goddamn coffins.
I told you, I don't want any of your goddamn coffins.
No. I don't work here.
No. I don't work here.
Huh?
Who are you? What do you want?
I don't want anything. I'm just a really big, big fan. I've seen all your movies.
I don't want anything. I'm just a really big, big fan. I've seen all your movies.
Ha!
Why were you buying a coffin?
Because I'm planning on dying soon.
Because I'm planning on dying soon.
Really?
Really?
Yes. I'm embarking on another bus- andótruck tour of "Dracula." Twelve cities in ten days, if that's conceivable.
You know, I saw you perform "Dracula." In Poughkeepsie, in 1938.
Eh, that was a terrible production. Renfield was a drunk!

I thought it was great. You were much scarier in real life than you were in the movie.

Thank you.
Thank you.
I waited to get your autograph, but you never came outside.
I waited to get your autograph, but you never came outside.
I apologize. When I play Dracula, I put myself into a trance. It takes me much time to re-emerge.
Oh, there's my bus. Shit, where's my transfer?!
Don't you bave a car?
Don't you bave a car?
I refuse to drive in this country. Too many madmen.
Boy, Mr. Lugosi, you must lead such an exciting life. When is your next picture coming out?
I have no next picture.
I have no next picture.
Ah, you gotta be jokin'! A great man like you... I'll bet you have dozens of 'em lined up.
Ah, you gotta be jokin'! A great man like you... I'll bet you have dozens of 'em lined up.
Back in the old days, yes. But now -- no one give two fucks for Bela.
But you're a big star!
No more. I haven't worked in four years. This town, it chews you up, then spits you out. I'm just an ex-bogeyman. Make a right.
They don't want the classic horror films anymore. Today, it's all giant bugs, giant spiders, giant grasshoppers -- who would believe such nonsense!
The old ones were much spookier. They had castles, full moons...

The pure horror, it both repels and attracts them. Because in their collective unconsciousness, they have the agony of childbirth. The blood. The blood is horror.

I never thought of that.
I never thought of that.
Take my word for it. You want to "score" with a young lady, you take her to see "Dracula."
Shh! I'm coming! I will feed you!
Well... I guess I should go. Perhaps we could get together again?
Well... I guess I should go. Perhaps we could get together again?
Certainly. But now the children of the night are calling me.
Ugh! I hate the way she interrupts the pictures. She doesn't show 'em the proper respect.
I think she's a honey. Look at those jugs.
Vampira! You will come under my spell! You will be my slave of love.
Hey Bela, how do you do that?
Hey Bela, how do you do that?
You must be double-jointed, and you must be Hungarian. Vampira, look at me! Stare into my eyes.
I am getting tired. I need to take my medicine.
Do you want me to get it for you?
Do you want me to get it for you?
No thank you, Eddie. I'll be alright.
Are you sure this is okay?
Don't worry. I do it every Halloween.
Eddie, you got a new movie for me?!
Yeah, it's gonna be a great picture! You'll love your character! Bunny, Bela's here. Look, hit the bars, work some parties, and get me transvestites! <u>I need transvestites</u>!
Eddie, what kind of movie is this?
Well, It's about how people have two personalities. The side they show to the world, and then the secret person they hide inside.
Well, It's about how people have two personalities. The side they show to the world, and then the secret person they hide inside.
Oh, like Jekyll and Hyde! Ah, I've always wanted to play Jekyll and Hyde! I'm looking forward to this production.
Ehh, your part's a little different. You're like the God that looks down on all the characters, and oversees everything.
I don't understand.
I don't understand.
Well... you control everyone's fate. You're like the puppetmaster.
Well... you control everyone's fate. You're like the puppetmaster.
Ah, so I pull the strings!
Ah, so I pull the strings!
Yeah. You pull the strings -- "Pull the strings"... hey, that's pretty good!
Bela! It's so great to see you! And eight o'clock on the dot. Right on time!
I am always on time.
I am always on time.
Of course! Well, we got a big day planned for you... First, we're gonna start off a little easy, with you in that armchair over there. Then, once you're up to speed and cooking, we'll reset and bring out the laboratory equipment --

Uh, Eddie, do you have my money?
Uh, Eddie, do you have my money?
Huh?! Oh yeah, of course.
You're right, Bela. Now Dracula, <u>that's</u> a part that takes acting.
Of course! Dracula requires <u>presence</u>. It's all in the voice, and the eyes, and the hand --
Look, you seem a little agitated. Do you maybe wanna take a little break, go for a nice walk... and then we'll come back and shoot the scene?
BULLSHIT! I am ready now! Roll the camera!!
How 'bout a western? People love westerns.
But, I don't like horses. Do I have to get on one?
But, I don't like horses. Do I have to get on one?

Uh, a cop. NO! You play the father. He's <u>angry</u>! He doesn't like seeing his son -- no -- he doesn't like seeing his <u>daughter</u> behave this way!
Uh, a cop. NO! You play the father. He's <u>angry</u>! He doesn't like seeing his son -- no -- he doesn't like seeing his <u>daughter</u> behave this way!
Well... can't I play the romantic part? I'm tired of always being the bad guy. You know, back in Hungary, I played Romeo! I would like to be the lover again -- me, in a boat, with the girl...
Sure. Romance, that's great! To engineer your comeback, we're gonna need a whole slate of pictures. Once "Glen Or Glenda" takes off, we'll slam you into one, then another, then another!
That's good. I could use the money.
That's good. I could use the money.
But we need to start off with a bang! Something we <u>know</u> the audience will want to see. Mmm. What was your biggest hit?

So let's make another "Dracula." Let's make "The Return of Dracula"!

We can't. Those sons-a-bitches control the rights.
They do? Shoot. There <u>must</u> be a way to get around that...
Ha-ha! Dr. Acula!
Dracula?
Dracula?
No! <u>Doctor Acula</u>! You can still wear the cape, have the fangs... but you're a doctor! Not a count.
No! <u>Doctor Acula</u>! You can still wear the cape, have the fangs... but you're a doctor! Not a count.
Ah! This is very exciting.
Ah! This is very exciting.
I gotta type this up, while it's still fresh!
Bela, what happened?!
I didn't feel well...
I didn't feel well...
Let me take you to the hospital.
Let me take you to the hospital.
No hospital. Just take me to the couch...
Should I call a doctor?
Nah. This happens all the time...
Is there anything I can get you? Water? A blanket?
Goulash.
Goulash.
I don't know how to make goulash.
What's in the needle?
Morphine, with a demerol chaser. Eddie, I'm so broke. I don't know what I'm gonna do...
Morphine, with a demerol chaser. Eddie, I'm so broke. I don't know what I'm gonna do...
Don't worry. I'll do something.
"Greetings. I am the Count."
"Greetings. I am Slick Slomopavitz, Seeker of Adventure." Audience laughs. Applause. "Say, that's a funny place to sleep."
"Greetings. I am Slick Slomopavitz, Seeker of Adventure." Audience laughs. Applause. "Say, that's a funny place to sleep."
"It is my home."
"It is my home."
"Oh, tract housing, huh?" Laugh. "You need a new real estate agent."
"Oh, tract housing, huh?" Laugh. "You need a new real estate agent."
"Beg to differ. This casket incarpratates, er, inporporates --"
No Bela, that's "incorporates." Look, just say "This casket has..."
Ach! How do they expect a Hungarian to pronounce this dialogue? This live television is madness!
Bela, don't worry. You're better than all this crap.
I never said I could ad-lib...
I never said I could ad-lib...
Forget about it. We'll make our new movie, and you'll be a star again.
Goodbye! Goodbye!
So how'd we do?
So how'd we do?
We didn't make a dime.
Bela, are you ready?
Mmph? Where am I?
Mmph? Where am I?
You're shooting "Bride Of The Atom." Scene 85.
You'll be sitting on the right.
I'm not getting near that goddamn thing. One of those burned me on "The Return Of Chandu."
I'm not getting near that goddamn thing. One of those burned me on "The Return Of Chandu."
Okay. Then you'll be sitting on the <u>left</u>.
"Dear, you are a woman of super strength and beauty. A lovely vision of exquisitely beauty -- shit!" Damn! Eddie, I'm sorry I can't remember all this. I'm an old man. It's too long.
That's fine, Bela. We're still rolling. Just say "Dear, you're lovely."
That's fine, Bela. We're still rolling. Just say "Dear, you're lovely."
"Dear, you're lovely." "Strap her to the table."
Bela, I don't know what I'm doin' anymore...
Stop worrying. This is going to raise your spirits.
What is this place?
This is the Philosophical Research Society. A refuge for free thinkers. I've been coming here for twenty years.
Was I wrong to cast Loretta?
Bad decisions are easy to live with. Forget. Just keep looking forward.
Bad decisions are easy to live with. Forget. Just keep looking forward.
But was it a bad decision? At the time, I thought her money would save the movie.
But was it a bad decision? At the time, I thought her money would save the movie.
Eddie, you screwed up.
Eddie, you screwed up.
Yeah, I did.
In life, the decisions that haunt you are the ones where you just don't know... where right or wrong will never be answered. Years ago, the Hungarians contacted me. The government wanted me to come home, to be Minister of Culture.
Really?
Really?
It was a very impressive offer. Fancy offices, a big home... I'd be treated like a king.
It was a very impressive offer. Fancy offices, a big home... I'd be treated like a king.
So why didn't you do it?
So why didn't you do it?
I didn't know if it was a trick. They might arrest me and throw me in a gulag. I am Hungary's most famous emigrant. they'd use me as a lesson to anyone who tries to leave.

But maybe not.
But maybe not.
Correct. So instead, I stayed here, waiting for my comeback. Always hoping... the next film, the next film... that would be the one.
Eddie, I'm so tired... I don't know if I can handle a night shoot...
Nonsense! You look great -- Look, uh, why don't you lie down and take a little nap? We'll film around you for a while.
Let's shoot this fucker! Where do I go?
You'll be fighting with the octopus.
You'll be fighting with the octopus.
Out <u>there</u>?! What happened to the stream?
Out <u>there</u>?! What happened to the stream?
This'll look a lot better. We have to match the stock footage of the octopus underwater.
This'll look a lot better. We have to match the stock footage of the octopus underwater.
Oh, for Christ's sake.
Goddamn, it's cold!
Once you're in it, it warms up.
Once you're in it, it warms up.
Fuck you! <u>You</u> come out here. Hey, toss me that J.D.
Okay! How do we turn this thing on?
Bela, somebody misplaced the motor. So when you wrestle the octopus, shake the legs a bit, to make it look like it's killing you.
Do you know I turned down "Frankenstein"?
Huh?
Huh?
After I did "Dracula," the studio offered me "Frankenstein"! But I turned it down, the part wasn't sexy enough. It was too degrading for a big star like me.
Bela, I've got twenty-five scenes to shoot tonight.
Don't let me slow you down.
Don't let me slow you down.
Alright! Let's put it on film. CAMERA! SOUND!
Bela. I just wanna thank you again for last night.
That's fine, Eddie. All in the line of duty.
That's fine, Eddie. All in the line of duty.
No. Seriously. I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done for me. A great man like you shouldn't have to run around in freezing water at four in the morning.
No. Seriously. I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done for me. A great man like you shouldn't have to run around in freezing water at four in the morning.
Well, there aren't too many other fellas I'd do it for...
Well, there aren't too many other fellas I'd do it for...
I wrote something special for you. I got to thinking about all the sacrifices you've made... and so I wrote you a new final speech.
Eddie, this is quite a scene.
I know it's a lot to give you at the last second.
Why are you here??
Shit! Bela, what's with the gun?
Shit! Bela, what's with the gun?
Why aren't you on your honeymoon? Where's Myrna?
Why aren't you on your honeymoon? Where's Myrna?
Norma. She changed her mind. She doesn't wanna marry me. Can you put down the gun?
What are you doing?
I was thinking about killing myself.
I was thinking about killing myself.
Jesus Christ, what an evening. What happened?
Jesus Christ, what an evening. What happened?
Eddie, I received a letter from the government. They're cutting off my unemployment. That's all I've got. Without it, I can't pay the rent...
Eddie, I received a letter from the government. They're cutting off my unemployment. That's all I've got. Without it, I can't pay the rent...
Don't you have any savings?
Don't you have any savings?
I'm obsolete. I have nothing to live for. Tonight, I should die. And you should come with me.
Buddy, I don't know if that's such a good idea.
It'll be wonderful. We'll be at peace. In the afterlife, you don't have to worry about finding work.
It'll be wonderful. We'll be at peace. In the afterlife, you don't have to worry about finding work.
Bela, I'm on your side. C'mon, give me the gun... If you give me the gun, I'll make you a drink. What are you drinking?
Bela, I'm on your side. C'mon, give me the gun... If you give me the gun, I'll make you a drink. What are you drinking?
Formaldehyde.
Don't worry.
I'm sorry, Eddie. I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry, Eddie. I'm so sorry.
Don't worry. Everything's gonna be all right.
What happened?!
Isn't it wonderful? After all these years, the press is showing an interest again in Bela Lugosi.
Isn't it wonderful? After all these years, the press is showing an interest again in Bela Lugosi.
Bela, they're parasites! They just want to exploit you.
Bela, they're parasites! They just want to exploit you.
Fine. Let them! There is no such thing as bad press. A man from New York even said he's putting me on the front page! First celebrity to ever check into rehab. When I get out of here, I will be healthy. Strong! I will be primed for my comeback!
I've got some good news. The doctor says you're all better. You can come home.
Really? I don't feel so great.
Really? I don't feel so great.
No, you look good. And the tests came back fine. C'mon...
Eddie, I wanna make another picture. When are we gonna make another picture?
Soon, Bela... Soon.
So Eddie, don't we need a sound crew?
No, this is just the second unit. We'll do the main footage later.
No, this is just the second unit. We'll do the main footage later.
Oh. So what is the scene about?
Oh. So what is the scene about?
Uh... you're a very important and respected man. You're leaving your house... and you're in a hurry to a big social event.
Okay. But what if I'm not in <u>too</u> big a hurry? What if I take a moment to slow down and savor the beauty of life? To smell a flower?
That's great. Let's do a take.
And, cut...
Eddie, how was I?
Eddie, how was I?
Perfect.
Sorry...
Has anyone ever been to Downey?
Last night was quite a romp.
Did you see that kid grab Vampira's tits?
Did you see that kid grab Vampira's tits?
I envied him. Hell, I envied you too, having a girlfriend that would jump in front of a car like that.
I envied him. Hell, I envied you too, having a girlfriend that would jump in front of a car like that.
Yeah, she's really somethin'.
Yeah, she's really somethin'.
I know none of <u>my</u> wives would've.
Eddie, I want to thank you. These last few days have been a good time.
I just wish you coulda seen the movie.
I just wish you coulda seen the movie.
No problem. I know it by heart...
So guess where I'm going next weekend?
I don't know. Where?
I don't know. Where?
Mexico! And guess what I'm going to do there?!
Mexico! And guess what I'm going to do there?!
I dunno. Lie on the beach?
I dunno. Lie on the beach?
WRONG! I'm getting my first series of hormone shots! And once those babies kick in, they're gonna remove my organs, and MAKE ME A WOMAN!
Jesus! Are you serious?
Yes! I've dreamed of it for years, but your movie made me realize I've got to take action. GOODBYE, PENIS!
I've never seen anything like him!
And once I'm a woman, Jean-Claude and I are getting married --
And once I'm a woman, Jean-Claude and I are getting married --
Ssh! He's so big! He's a <u>monster</u>! Can you imagine what that guy would be like in a movie?
This is gonna be Bela's laboratory, so it should be real impressive! Like one of those mad scientist movies. I want beakers, and test tubes, and one of those electrical things that buzzes!
You mean a Tesla coil?
You mean a Tesla coil?
If you say so.
PLACES, EVERYONE! ROLL CAMERA!
Rolling.
And, CUT! PRINT IT! LET'S MOVE ON!
Don't you want a second take, for protection?
Don't you want a second take, for protection?
What's to protect? It was perfect!
Um, okay... roll camera
Rolling.
Rolling.
Sound!
Which one <u>is</u> the red one?
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
I mean I can't see the difference. I'm color-blind. But I like the dark gray one.
Hey Ed, shouldn't we do another take? Big Baldy kinda got stuck in the doorway.
No, it's fine. It's real! In actuality, Lobo would struggle with that problem every day.
I got the early edition! It was just dropped off at the newsstand.
This is the big moment...!
You really think so?
Absolutely! It's just the beginning. I promise this: If we stick together, one day I'll make every single one of you famous.
What happened?! Jesus, Connie, what did you do?
Nothin'! I told him he was great.
What do you think you're doin'?!
These shoes are itchy.
These shoes are itchy.
You <u>can't sit</u>! You gotta walk around, with good posture. You want these people to think we have class. Otherwise they'll <u>never</u> invest in our movie.
You don't understand! The octopus is supposed to live in a <u>lake</u>!
This is kind of a stream--
This is kind of a stream--
NO! It has to be UNDERWATER!
Wow.
And who may you be?
And who may you be?
Edward Wood, Sir.
Edward Wood, Sir.
Ah. The director of "Glen Or Glenda."
Ah. The director of "Glen Or Glenda."
H-how'd you know?!
H-how'd you know?!
I'm Criswell. I know all.
Hey Cris, how'd you know we'd be living on Mars by 1970? How'd you know it wouldn't be 1975, or even 1980?
I guessed.
I guessed.
I don't understand.
I don't understand.
I made it up. It's horseshit!
There's no such thing as a psychic. People believe my folderol because I wear a turban and a black tuxedo.
It's that easy?
It's that easy?
Eddie, we're in show biz! It's all about razzle-dazzle. Appearances. If you dress nice and talk well, people will swallow anything.
Bravo! Bravo! Magnifico!
Cris, you made it. Thanks a lot.
Cris, you made it. Thanks a lot.
My pleasure. I'm always happy to assist in a little larceny.
Incidentally, you <u>promise</u> you're not going to scratch my car...?
I told you, the octopus is made of rubber. This is a piece o' cake.
Edward, are you sure you know what you're doing?
Yeah. It seems a little crazy, but sometimes <u>you just know</u>. She's perfect for me.
Excuse me. Doctor? I'm with Mr. Lugosi. How is he?
Well... there's a lot of junk in his system for such an old man. Apparently, he was addicted to morphine, tried to kick it, and got re-addicted to methadone.

Will he be okay?
Will he be okay?
We'll do our best.
We thought Mr. Lugosi was insured though the Screen Actors Guild.
Isn't he?
Isn't he?
No. They say his eligibility ran out years ago.
No. They say his eligibility ran out years ago.
Look, he doesn't have any money... but I'll give you everything I've got. I have a few hundred dollars.
Dolores, give me your shoes.
What?
What?
The ghost can be barefoot. <u>Give</u> <u>me your shoes</u>!
Honey, what if I'm wrong? What if I just don't have it?
Ed, it was only one review.
Ed, it was only one review.
Orson Welles was 26 when he made "Citizen Kane." I'm already 30!

Ed, you're still young. This is the part of your life when you're <u>supposed</u> to be struggling.
Ed, you're still young. This is the part of your life when you're <u>supposed</u> to be struggling.
I know... But sometimes I get scared this is as good as it's gonna get...
Eddie, I don't understand. Why are <u>you</u> the most qualified director for the Christine Jorgensen Story?
Aw, er, it's just a bunch of hot air. I had to say something to get in the door.
Sweetie, you won't believe it! I've got the most incredible news!
You got the job?!!
You got the job?!!
Huh?! Oh, uh, no, I didn't get the job. But something <u>better</u> happened!
Huh?! Oh, uh, no, I didn't get the job. But something <u>better</u> happened!
Better than not getting a job?

Yeah! I met a movie star! Somebody <u>really big</u>!

Who? Robert Taylor?!

You met Basil Rathbone!
You met Basil Rathbone!
Oh, the hell with you. I met BELA LUGOSI!
Oh, the hell with you. I met BELA LUGOSI!
I thought he was dead.
No! He's very alive. Well... sort of. He's old, and frail -- but he's still Bela Lugosi! And he's really nice.
Boy, I can't even remember the last time he was in a picture.
Boy, I can't even remember the last time he was in a picture.
It's a shame. He's such a rest actor, and nobody uses him anymore.
It's a shame. He's such a rest actor, and nobody uses him anymore.
So did you get his autograph?
Ed, I'm so proud! I'll read it as soon as I get home.
Well, I'd really like to know what you think. Why don't you go in the bedroom and take a look at it? I'll Wait...
How long have you been doing this?
Since I was a kid. My mom wanted a girl, so she used to dress me in girlie clothing. It just kinda became a habit.
Since I was a kid. My mom wanted a girl, so she used to dress me in girlie clothing. It just kinda became a habit.
Jesus Christ! And you never told me?
Jesus Christ! And you never told me?
This is my way of telling you --
This is my way of telling you --
What, by putting it in a fuckin' script, for everyone to see?! What kind of sick mind would operate like that?
And what about this so-called "Barbara" character? It's obviously ME! I'm so embarrassed! This is <u>our</u> <u>life</u>!
Of course it is. And that's why you should play the part.
Of course it is. And that's why you should play the part.
Oh! You got nerve, buddy.
It's a damn good role.
<u>That's not the issue</u>!! Ugh! How can you act so casual, when you're dressed like that?!
<u>That's not the issue</u>!! Ugh! How can you act so casual, when you're dressed like that?!
It takes me comfortable.
It takes me comfortable.
Oh, just like in the script!
How can you just walk around like that, in front of all these people?
Hon', nobody's bothered but you. Look around -- they couldn't care less.
Hon', nobody's bothered but you. Look around -- they couldn't care less.
Ed, this isn't the real world! You've surrounded yourself with WEIRDOS!
Ed, this isn't the real world! You've surrounded yourself with WEIRDOS!
Say it a little louder. I don't think Bela heard you in his trailer.
Ed, who is Daniel Davis?
Some weirdo who likes to wear dresses.
From today on, our lives are different! We'll be swimming laps in the same pool Jean Harlow did.
I don't know. It's so much money...
I don't know. It's so much money...
Who cares?! We're on a ROLL! These are the moments in life you're supposed to grab.
Who cares?! We're on a ROLL! These are the moments in life you're supposed to grab.
But Ed, we're not even married. And you don't have a job.
But Ed, we're not even married. And you don't have a job.
But <u>you</u> do! And anyway, I've got tons of new scripts. And now that I have a track record, studios are bound to hire me!
Look on the bright side. If we miss the rent, what's the worst they can do?
Toss us out on our ass.
Toss us out on our ass.
Exactly.
I'm no good.
Ed, it's just one man's opinion!
Ed, it's just one man's opinion!
Bela needs a job... I can't even get a film going... But <u>of course</u> I can't -- I made the worst movie of all time.
Bela needs a job... I can't even get a film going... But <u>of course</u> I can't -- I made the worst movie of all time.
That's ridiculous.
All I wanna do is tell stories. The things I find interesting...
Well maybe you're not studio kind of material. Maybe you just need to raise the money yourself.
Ed, the landlord called again. He wants his money.
Tell him "Bride" is in pre- production.
Tell him "Bride" is in pre- production.
Ed, the landlord doesn't care.

That's the problem! <u>Nobody</u> cares about my movie! I'm tryin' so hard, I don't know what else to do!
That's the problem! <u>Nobody</u> cares about my movie! I'm tryin' so hard, I don't know what else to do!
Don't get angry at me. Maybe you just need a day job.
Don't get angry at me. Maybe you just need a day job.
Dolores, don't you understand? I'm a director now! I made "Glen Or Glenda." Directing <u>is</u> my day job.
Dolores, don't you understand? I'm a director now! I made "Glen Or Glenda." Directing <u>is</u> my day job.
All I know is, ever since "Glen Or Glenda," all you do is booze it up and wear my clothes!
It was the only way I could get the movie made!
Who do you think's been paying the rent?! Who helped type your script, and did all your grunt work?!
Who do you think's been paying the rent?! Who helped type your script, and did all your grunt work?!
I'm sorry! What did you want me to say?
I'm sorry! What did you want me to say?
I wanted you to say, "No! I wrote the part for my girlfriend Dolores."
I wanted you to say, "No! I wrote the part for my girlfriend Dolores."
But there's plenty of other parts.

Like <u>what</u>?!

The secretary. Or the file clerk.
Goddamn landlord.
I told you this was gonna happen.

Maybe if you'd come to the backers party, I would've gotten the money.
Maybe if you'd come to the backers party, I would've gotten the money.

That's a good reason to dump your girlfriend.
That's a good reason to dump your girlfriend.
<u>I didn't dump you</u>! Get it through your skull -- I just recast the part!
You're a fuckin' mess.
So WHAT?? Look, we gotta figure out where we're gonna stay.

I'm going to my mother's.

Does she have room for me?
Honey, you made it! I wasn't sure you got my message.
Of course I'm here. Today is the file clerk's big scene.
Of course I'm here. Today is the file clerk's big scene.
That's right...
That's right...
I see the usual gang of misfits and dope addicts are here. Say, who's the lug?
That's Tony McCoy. He's playing Lieutenant Dick Craig.
Oh really? How much money did he put up?

None. But his dad gave me fifty grand.

Hey, <u>the movie's getting made</u>. That's the main thing.
Eddie, what's <u>my</u> motivation?
Oh. Er... well you're the file clerk. You're hurrying into the next room, when you bump into Janet.
Oh. Er... well you're the file clerk. You're hurrying into the next room, when you bump into Janet.
But what's our relationship? Are we good friends, or is she just a casual acquaintance?

Dolores, I got five days to shoot this movie. Quit kidding around.
Dolores, wait!
Ed, it's over. I need a normal life.
Ed, it's over. I need a normal life.
Did you really mean those things you said..?
I'm tired of living on the fringe.
But you used to say --
But you used to say --
Ed... I just stuck it out so you could finish your movie. Now that it's done, so am I.
Pleased to meet you. I'm Loretta King.
I understand you just moved here?
I understand you just moved here?
Yes. Hollywood is oh so exciting.
So my associate Mr. Marco tells me you may be interested in investing in a motion picture.
Perhaps a small amount of money. How much do one of your motion pictures cost?
Perhaps a small amount of money. How much do one of your motion pictures cost?
For this one, we need $60,000.
For this one, we need $60,000.
That's all?? That seems very reasonable for an entire picture.
Perhaps you'd like to look at the photoplay.
Oh my, this is very interesting. Say... do you think it would be possible for me to maybe play one of these parts?
Oh my, this is very interesting. Say... do you think it would be possible for me to maybe play one of these parts?
Oh, of course!! There's a couple characters you'd be perfect for: The secretary at the newspaper office, or the file clerk!
Oh, of course!! There's a couple characters you'd be perfect for: The secretary at the newspaper office, or the file clerk!
Hmm. Those sound kind of small. Oh, here's one that looks good: Janet Lawton. I'd sure like to play her.
Eddie, which dress do you like better?
I don't know. Hey Bill, which dress is better for you, the green or the red one?
Sorry to bother you while we're shooting, but the guy who owns the stage needs his money.
Well then you should pay him, shouldn't you?
Well then you should pay him, shouldn't you?
Yeah. Exactly!
I kinda need it now.
What are you looking at me like that for? I already gave you my three hundred.
What are you looking at me like that for? I already gave you my three hundred.
Yeah. Well I need the other sixty-thousand.
Yeah. Well I need the other sixty-thousand.
What other sixty-thousand?
What other sixty-thousand?
The other sixty-thousand you said you'd give me.
The other sixty-thousand you said you'd give me.
You misunderstood. I gave you everything I have in the world: Three-hundred dollars.
Hey big shot, get off your ass. They need a potted palm over in the Carl Laemmle Building.
Sure thing, Mr. Kravitz.
He's a <u>bum</u>.
No he's not! Do you realize how much money he made for this studio over the years? "Dracula"! "The Raven"! "The Black Cat"!
No he's not! Do you realize how much money he made for this studio over the years? "Dracula"! "The Raven"! "The Black Cat"!
Yeah? Well now he's a junkie. He don't deserve to work.
Yeah? Well now he's a junkie. He don't deserve to work.
That's not true --

He's so great, <u>you</u> hire him.

Well, uh, if I could I would...
Mr. Ward, it's a delight to meet you.
It's Wood. Ed Wood.
It's Wood. Ed Wood.
Wood? Ward? Wood. Hey, what do you know. It <u>is</u> Wood. Dang secretaries, you can never get a good one. Right?
So what are you bringing me? Looks like you got some film cans.
Well, Mr. Feldman, some people have resumes to show. I've got my own movie.

Nobody in town has seen it, so I'm givin' you first crack at my talents.
I can't wait to take a look. So what's up next?
Well, Mr. Feldman, I don't believe in thinking small. So I've got a whole slate of pictures for you: "The Vampire's Tomb," "The Ghoul Goes West"... and "Doctor Acula"!
Doctor Acula? I don't get it.
Doctor Acula? I don't get it.
<u>Dr. Acula</u>!
Oh, "Dr. Acula." I get it. I don't like it.
But Bela Lugosi's in it!
But Bela Lugosi's in it!
Lugosi's washed-up. What else you got?
Well... I've got another project I wasn't gonna tell you about. Lugosi's in it, but he's got a smaller part. The lead is an ingenue, a sterling young actress named Dolores Fuller. The title is "Bride Of The Atom."
Ah! Atomic Age stuff, huh? I like it. I'll tell you what, Mr. Ward. Why don't you leave those film cans, and my associates and I will take a look at your little opus. Maybe we can do business together.
Mr. Wood?!
Hruphh...?
Hruphh...?
Mr. Wood, this is Mr. Reynolds, your landlord. Could you please open up?
Yeah...?
Mr. Wood, you have bounced your third and final rent check.
Mr. Wood, you have bounced your third and final rent check.
I'm real sorry. My stockbroker must have transferred the wrong account... C'mon in, I'll write you another one.
Hmm, so you're in the picture business?
You could say that --
You could say that --
<u>I'm</u> interested in the picture business. My associates and I wish to produce a series of uplifting religious films, on the Apostles. But unfortunately, we don't have enough money.
<u>I'm</u> interested in the picture business. My associates and I wish to produce a series of uplifting religious films, on the Apostles. But unfortunately, we don't have enough money.
Raising money is tough.
Raising money is tough.
Oh! Our church has the money for one film. We just don't have it for all twelve...
Okay -- you know what you do? You produce a film in a commercially proven genre. And after it's a hit, you take the profits from <u>that</u>, and make the twelve Apostles' movies.
Would that work?
Would that work?
Absolutely! You see this script..?
"Graverobbers From Outer Space"! It's <u>money in the bank</u>.
Graverobbers from <u>what</u>??
Graverobbers from <u>what</u>??
From outer space! It's science- fiction. <u>Very</u> big with the kids! If you make this picture, you'll have enough money to finance a HUNDRED religious films! <u>And</u> pay my back rent from the profits.
I don't know... this is all a lot to absorb.
It's a guaranteed blockbuster!
It's a guaranteed blockbuster!
Um, I understand that this science friction is popular -- but don't the big hits always have big stars?
Um, I understand that this science friction is popular -- but don't the big hits always have big stars?
Yeah, well we've GOT a big star! Bela Lugosi!!
Yeah, well we've GOT a big star! Bela Lugosi!!
<u>Lugosi</u>??! Didn't be pass on?
Yes, but I've got the last footage he ever shot!
Just, it doesn't look like very much.
Just, it doesn't look like very much.
It's plenty! It's the acorn that will grow a great oak. I'll just find a double to finish his scenes, and we'll release it as "Bela Lugosi's Final Film"
What'd you give him all the lines for?? He's unintelligible!
Look, Lugosi is dead and Vampira won't talk. Ihad to give <u>somebody</u> the dialogue.
And PERFECT. CUT!
"Perfect"? Mr. Wood, do you know <u>anything</u> about the art of film production?!
"Perfect"? Mr. Wood, do you know <u>anything</u> about the art of film production?!
I like to think so.
I like to think so.
That cardboard headstone tipped over. This graveyard is obviously phony!
That cardboard headstone tipped over. This graveyard is obviously phony!
People won't notice. Filmmaking isn't about picky details -- it's about the big picture.
People won't notice. Filmmaking isn't about picky details -- it's about the big picture.
Oh, you wanna talk about the "big picture"?! How 'bout that the policemen arrive in the daylight, but now it's suddenly night???
Mr. Reynolds!
Yes?
Yes?
We are gonna finish this film <u>just</u> <u>the way I want it</u>! Because you can't compromise an artist's vision!
Glad you could fit me in your schedule.
Da pleasure be mine.
Could we moovf to table?
Oh, of course!
So, Mr. Johnson --
Tor!
Tor!
Tor. Have you ever thought about becoming an actor?
Tor. Have you ever thought about becoming an actor?
Mm, not good-lookink enough.
Mm, not good-lookink enough.
I think you're quite handsome.
I think you're quite handsome.
No. With hair, yah. But I must shave head for wrestlink. It scare da crowds. Dey like that.
Well, I think you'd be a sensation in pictures.
But what bout accent? Some people tink I haf too much accent.
But what bout accent? Some people tink I haf too much accent.
Nah, that doesn't matter! It's a visual medium.
So anyway, I've got this new script, "Bride Of The Atom," and there's a part you're ideal for: "Lobo." He's tough. A brute. But he has a heart -- and at the end he saves the girl.
I like. When do movie shoot?
I like. When do movie shoot?
Hopefully, very soon. I'm just awaiting the final okay from Mr. Feldman at MGM.
Edvard! I haf question 'bout script. My vife Greta, she read. And she no like.
Really? Was the third act too intense?
Really? Was the third act too intense?
No. She tink Lobo is waste of my time. Lobo don't talk.
No. She tink Lobo is waste of my time. Lobo don't talk.
But Tor, it's a starring part! You're second billed.
But Tor, it's a starring part! You're second billed.
Bela, he talk. Loretta, she talk. But Tor, he no talk.
Tor, dialogue is overrated. You look at the classic film actors, who are they? Fairbanks. Chaplin. They didn't talk! They did it all with their face.
But Greta say --
Here's the scene. Loretta, you're in a trance. You glide in and get on the operating table. Now Tor, you're supposed to tie her down. But you have an angora fetish... and when you rub that swatch of angora, it makes you refuse so Bela has to discipline you.
Okey-dokey.
Hey! You're not eatink.
Uh, I don't have much of an appetite lately.
Uh, I don't have much of an appetite lately.
The food will make you feel bedder. Look at me -- I'm da happiest guy I know!
I'd be happy too, if I had such a great family.
Don't worry. You just haven't met right woman yet. Oopsy. That cabbage goes right through me.
Tor, I should be getting home.
Nonsense! You must try our hot glug.
My friend, you tink Greta is first woman I ever see? No! Many duds, before I find her.
But I thought me and Dolores had something.
But I thought me and Dolores had something.
Forget her! Move on. A good lookink boy like you as you can have any girl you wish.
My eyes are killink me.
Don't worry. We're almost there.
What is happening?
We're escaping!
Excuse me, Sir...?
Yes?
Yes?
Uh, uh, I'm a young filmmaker, and a really big fan... and I just wanted to meet you.
Uh, uh, I'm a young filmmaker, and a really big fan... and I just wanted to meet you.
My pleasure. I'm Orson Welles.
My pleasure. I'm Orson Welles.
Oh. Um, I'm Ed Wood! So, what are you working on now?
Oh. Um, I'm Ed Wood! So, what are you working on now?
Eh, the financing just fell through for the third time on "Don Quixote." So I'm trying to finish a promo for something else. But I can't find the soundtrack -- I think I left it in Malta.
I can't believe it. These sound like <u>my</u> problems!
It's the damn money men. You never know who's a windbag, and who's got the goods. And then they all think <u>they're</u> a director...
It's the damn money men. You never know who's a windbag, and who's got the goods. And then they all think <u>they're</u> a director...
Ain't that the truth! I've even bad producers recut my movies --

Ugh, I hate when that happens.

And they always want to cast their buddies -- it doesn't even <u>matter</u> if they're right for the part!
And they always want to cast their buddies -- it doesn't even <u>matter</u> if they're right for the part!
Tell me about it. I'm supposed to do a thriller at Universal, and they want Charlton Heston to play a <u>Mexican</u>!
Mr. Welles, is it all worth it?
It is when it works. You know the one film of mine I can stand to watch? "Kane." The studio hated it... but they didn't get to touch a frame. Ed, visions are worth fighting for. Why spend your life making someone else's dreams?
Can I help you?
Yes, I'm Ed Wood. I'm here about directing the Christine Jorgensen picture.
Yes, I'm Ed Wood. I'm here about directing the Christine Jorgensen picture.
Yeah, well a couple of things have changed. It ain't gonna be the Christine Jorgensen story no more. Goddamn "Variety" printed the story before I had the rights, and now that bitch is asking for the sky.
Yeah, well a couple of things have changed. It ain't gonna be the Christine Jorgensen story no more. Goddamn "Variety" printed the story before I had the rights, and now that bitch is asking for the sky.
So you're not gonna make the movie?
So you're not gonna make the movie?
No, of COURSE I'm gonna make the movie! I've already preósold Alabama and Oklahoma. Those repressed Okies really go for that twisted pervert stuff. So we'll just make it without that she-male. We'll fictitionalize it.
Is there a script?
Fuck no! But there's a poster.
It opens in nine weeks in Tulsa.
Well, Mr. Weiss, I'm your guy. I work fast, and I'm a deal: I write AND direct. And I'm good. I just did a play in Hollywood, and Victor Crowley praised its realism.
Well, Mr. Weiss, I'm your guy. I work fast, and I'm a deal: I write AND direct. And I'm good. I just did a play in Hollywood, and Victor Crowley praised its realism.
Hmm. There's five-hundred guys in town who can tell me the same thing. You said on the phone you had some kind of "special qualifications."
Well, Mr. Weiss, I've never told anyone what I'm about to tell you... but I really want this job. I like to dress in women's clothing.
Are you a fruit?
Are you a fruit?
No, no, not at all! I <u>love</u> women. Wearing their clothes makes me feel closer to them.
No, no, not at all! I <u>love</u> women. Wearing their clothes makes me feel closer to them.
So you're not a fruit?
So you're not a fruit?
Nah, I'm all man. I even fought in WW2. 'Course, I <u>was</u> wearing ladies' undergarments under my uniform.
Nah, I'm all man. I even fought in WW2. 'Course, I <u>was</u> wearing ladies' undergarments under my uniform.
You gotta be kiddin' me.
You gotta be kiddin' me.
Confidentially, I even paratrooped wearing a brassiere and panties. I'll tell ya, I wasn't scared of being killed, but I was <u>terrified</u> of getting wounded, and having the medics discover my secret.
And this is why you think you're the most qualified to make my movie?
Yeah. I know what it's like to live with a secret, and worry about what people are gonna think of you... My girlfriend still doesn't know why her sweaters are always stretched out.
Mr. Weiss, I was thinkin' about what you said, about how all your movies have to make a profit. And I realized, what's the one thing, that if you put in a movie, it'll be successful??
Tits.
Tits.
No. Better than tits -- a <u>star</u>!
Eddie, you must have me confused with David Selznick. I don't make major motion pictures. I make crap.
Yeah, but if you took that crap and put a star in it, you'd have something!
Yeah, but if you took that crap and put a star in it, you'd have something!
Yeah. Crap with a star.
Yeah. Crap with a star.
No! It would be something better! Something <u>impressive</u>. The biggest moneymaker you've ever had!
No! It would be something better! Something <u>impressive</u>. The biggest moneymaker you've ever had!
Fine, maybe you're right. But it doesn't friggin' matter. I can't afford a star, so I don't even know what we're talking about.
What if I told you you could have a star for $1000??
Who?
Lugosi?
Yeah! <u>Lugosi</u>!
Yeah! <u>Lugosi</u>!
Isn't he dead?
Isn't he dead?
No, he's not dead! He lives in Baldwin Hills. I met him recently, and he wants to be in our picture.
No, he's not dead! He lives in Baldwin Hills. I met him recently, and he wants to be in our picture.
OUR picture?
OUR picture?
Uh, yeah. Our picture.
Why would Lugosi want to be in a sex-change flick?
Because he's <u>my friend</u>.
I thought this was gonna be a sex- change film!
There's still a sex-change --
There's still a sex-change --
Yeah! Five pages right before it ends! The rest of the show is about some schmuck who likes angora sweaters.
Yeah! Five pages right before it ends! The rest of the show is about some schmuck who likes angora sweaters.
I don't think he's a schmuck.
I don't think he's a schmuck.
And what's with this new title?! My poster says "I CHANGED MY SEX"!
And what's with this new title?! My poster says "I CHANGED MY SEX"!
So change the poster. Trust me, you'll be better off. This is a story that's gonna <u>grab</u> people. It's about this guy. He's crazy about this girl but he likes to wear dresses. Should he tell her? Should he not tell her? He's torn. George, this is DRAMA.
Ed! What's with these revised pages?! A scene in a smelting factory? A buffalo stampede?? <u>Three-hundred soldiers storming Anzio</u> <u>Beach</u>??! What's going on here? I can't afford to film this nonsense!
Don't worry. We're not gonna film any of it.
Don't worry. We're not gonna film any of it.
<u>Then how's it gonna get in the</u> <u>picture</u>?!
<u>Then how's it gonna get in the</u> <u>picture</u>?!
I know a guy in Universal's stock house -- he's giving me the footage for free. This movie's gonna look like a million bucks.
I think it's fifty-seven minutes long.
Yeah? Whatever. So did you like it?
Yeah? Whatever. So did you like it?
Ed, what was the one thing I asked you to do? Make it <u>seven reels long</u>. I've got contracts with my exhibitors. If it ain't over an hour, they won't play it.
Ed, what was the one thing I asked you to do? Make it <u>seven reels long</u>. I've got contracts with my exhibitors. If it ain't over an hour, they won't play it.
Gee, I used every frame of film we shot. Maybe they won't notice.

They'll notice. Look, why don't you let me take over from here? I can do a few tricks: Pad it out with more stock footage, add establishing shots...

Um, I guess --

Good. And one more thing. I think your "Written, Directed, and Starring Ed Wood" credit is a bad idea.
Good. And one more thing. I think your "Written, Directed, and Starring Ed Wood" credit is a bad idea.
Why?! I did all those things! Hell, I even built the props.
Why?! I did all those things! Hell, I even built the props.
And you did a bang-up job, too. But you don't want other producers to know that's you in drag. Trust me. It's a career killer.
But I'm proud. I wrote, directed, and starred in it just like Orson Welles in "Citizen Kane"!
Yeah?? Well Orson Welles didn't wear angora sweaters, did he??!
Georgie, what's with the stag footage?? You said you were cutting in <u>establishing shots</u>!
I did. I established some tits and ass.
"Where's the ads"?! The ads are in Alabama, Indiana, and Missouri! You schmuck, it ain't gonna play L.A.!
Why not??
Why not??
Because I can't sell it to save my life! You made a goddamn feathered fish. Is it an art film, a horror show, a hygiene flick? Nobody knows! I'm beggin' people to book it.

Screw you, Wood! I even sunk more money into different titles: "Transvestite" "He Or She?" "I Led Two Lives"... It DOESN'T MATTER! Nobody wants to see the piece of shit.

You can't talk that way about my movie.
You can't talk that way about my movie.
"Your movie"?! I wish it was your movie! I wish I hadn't blown every dime I ever made into this stinkbomb. If I ever see you again, I'll kill you!!!

Oh, flowers! I didn't know you were so traditional.
I just picked them up on the way over...
I just picked them up on the way over...
They're very nice. Let me get my coat.
So have you always lived in L.A.?
No. I'm from back east. You know, All-American small town... everybody knew everybody, I was a Boy Scout, my dad worked for the post office...
No. I'm from back east. You know, All-American small town... everybody knew everybody, I was a Boy Scout, my dad worked for the post office...
Sounds like you lived in Grovers Corners.
Did you find it boring?
Nah, 'cause I had my comic books. And I read pulp magazines. And I listened to the radio dramas...
Oh. I loved those shows! "Inner Sanctum"... "The Shadow" --
Yeah! Don't forget "Mercury Theatre"... And then every Saturday, I'd go to the little movie theater down the street. I even started ushering there.
You're not gonna believe the first picture I ever saw. Your friend's.
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
"Dracula."
That <u>is</u> incredible! You know, I had to sleep with the lights on for a week after seeing that movie.
I had to sleep with the lights on for a month. But I never missed a Lugosi picture after that.
I had to sleep with the lights on for a month. But I never missed a Lugosi picture after that.
A few years ago, I actually saw him do "Dracula" live. I thought he was much scarier in person.
Kathy, I'm about to tell you something I've never told any girl on a first date. But I think it's important that you know. I like to wear women's clothes.
Huh?
Huh?
I like to wear women's clothes: Panties, brassieres, sweaters, pumps... it's just something I do. And I can't believe I'm telling you, but I really like you, and I don't want it getting in the way down the road.
Does this mean you don't like sex with girls?
No! I love sex with girls.
No! I love sex with girls.
Oh. Okay.
Oh. Okay.
Okay?
Stop!
STOP!
Ed, this spaghetti sauce is delicious.
Thanks. It's actually the only thing I know how to make. Hey, can you grab that strainer?
What was that?
Bela died.
I'd seen him in a coffin so many times, I expected him to jump out...
Ed, you've got to snap out of this. Bela's dead -- <u>you're not</u>!
Ed, you've got to snap out of this. Bela's dead -- <u>you're not</u>!
I might as well be. I made shitty movies that nobody wanted to see. I blew it. All he wanted was a comeback... that last glory...
I might as well be. I made shitty movies that nobody wanted to see. I blew it. All he wanted was a comeback... that last glory...
Well you tried --
Well you tried --
I was a fuckin' HACK! I let people recut the movies, cast their relatives... I let Bela down...
You know, when you rewrite a script, it just gets better and better!
Do you want your buttons on the left or the right?
Do you want your buttons on the left or the right?

Yes! BINGO! Solar energy! Oh that's gonna seem so scientific. This movie's gonna be the ultimate Ed Wood film. <u>No compromises</u>.
Those assholes.
The poor girl's out of a job.
The poor girl's out of a job.
Yeah... I should give her a call.
You should feel lucky. Ed's the only guy in town who doesn't pass judgment on people.
Hell, if I did, I wouldn't have any friends.
Look, it's Dr. Tom. Hey, Dr. Tom!
Who's Dr. Tom?
Who's Dr. Tom?
My chiropractor!
I can't get it to go up.
Ed, you're gonna miss your own premiere.

C'mon! Let's just go.
Ed, I'm so happy for you.
Let's get married.

Huh?!

<u>Right now</u>. Let's drive to Vegas!
<u>Right now</u>. Let's drive to Vegas!
But it's pouring. And the car top is stuck!
But it's pouring. And the car top is stuck!
So? It's only a five-hour drive. And it'll probably clear up, once we hit the desert. Heck, it'll probably clear up once we drive around the corner. I promise.
Excuse me, Miss Vampira?
Yes?
Yes?
You don't know me, but my name is Ed Wood. I'm a film producer. I'm currently in production on a science-fiction piece, with Bela Lugosi and Swedish wrestler Tor Johnson. And I saw you here, and I thought: Kismet!
I don't understand. Do you want my autograph?
No. I think my film is perfect for you.
No. I think my film is perfect for you.
You want me to show it on my TV program? Well I got nothing to do with that. You should call up the station manager at Channel Seven --
You want me to show it on my TV program? Well I got nothing to do with that. You should call up the station manager at Channel Seven --
No! I don't want you to show the movie, I want you to be <u>in it</u>! See, maybe I should explain: We started shooting, but then after three days we got shut down. So we're having a backers party, to raise some more money. Perhaps you'd like to come next door and meet some of the backers...?
Uh, look, I'm with some friends, and we're about to eat --
Please! It'll only take a minute. You can have some hors d'oeuvres, and meet my backers! There's a really nice dentist from Oxnard...
Please! It'll only take a minute. You can have some hors d'oeuvres, and meet my backers! There's a really nice dentist from Oxnard...
Look buddy, I'm a big star. I've got real offers from real studios. I don't need to blow some dentist for a part. So forget it!
No, don't worry, I moved on. I was just calling to see if you want to attend the world premiere of my new film, "Bride Of The Monster."
Didn't you just make one called "Bride Of The Atom"?
Didn't you just make one called "Bride Of The Atom"?
It's the same film. But the distributor wanted a punchier title. C'mon! It's gonna be a big event -- we're going all out! Bela, Tor, and Cris are coming. You'll have fun!
I'm really sorry...
It's terrible. People won't even return my calls. It's like I don't exist.
It's terrible. People won't even return my calls. It's like I don't exist.
I know what <u>that's</u> like. Anyway, I brought a copy of the script. You would play the "Ghoul's Wife."
I know what <u>that's</u> like. Anyway, I brought a copy of the script. You would play the "Ghoul's Wife."
The <u>Ghoul's Wife</u>?! God, I can't believe I'm doing this...
Look... would it be possible to make the "Ghoul's Wife" a little less prominent, so people won't really notice me in the movie?
You don't wanna be noticed?
You don't wanna be noticed?
Exactly. Hey, how 'bout this -- what if I don't have any lines? I'll do the part mute!
<u>It's uncanny</u>.
What's uncanny?
What's uncanny?
LOOK AT HIS SKULL!
Hell, I've seen a lot worse reviews. I've seen ones where they didn't even like the costumes! Like, that last "Francis the Mule" picture -- it got <u>terrible</u> notices. But it was a huge hit.
Lines around the block.
Lines around the block.
So don't take it too seriously. We're all doin' great work.
The set doesn't look right! It looks too... empty. Clutter it up. Put a skeleton in the corner. And what's that thing over there?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Well it looks good. Let's use it!
Just like I always promised. Now you're among the immortals. You're movie stars.
Here's to Ed. For making us into something.
Uh, yoo-hoo. Excuse me! Sorry to interrupt, but I got some big news.
Yeah...?
Yeah...?
Well my cousin Fred met this dame from back East. She's from "old money," and he thinks she's loaded. And here's the kicker: She's <u>very</u> <u>interested</u> in the picture business!
Wow, this lab looks great. Except why is there a stove and refrigerator?
We couldn't afford any more props. If it seems weird, maybe you can add a scene where they eat dinner.
We couldn't afford any more props. If it seems weird, maybe you can add a scene where they eat dinner.
Nah, it'll work. Where's Bela?
Ed, you said you were getting permission.
Uh, I couldn't reach the guy... he was in meetings all day. But this'll be great, I promise!
You're sure this is gonna work?
Yes!
Yes!
You're <u>sure</u>???
You're <u>sure</u>???
YES! JUST DO IT!
Hey. This is looking good! Paul, where's the octopus motor?
What octopus motor?
What octopus motor?
You know, to make the legs move --
You know, to make the legs move --
Hey, don't blame me! You didn't say anything about no motor when I was up on that ceiling!
Norma, this is Bela -- Bela, this is Norma. Norma, this is Tor -- Tor, this is Norma. Norma, this is Paul Paul, this is Norma.
So how long have you known Eddie?
Ed, I got the Lugosi lookalikes outside.
Great! Bring 'em in! Bunny, I gotta run.
Too tall... too short... And this guy doesn't work at all.
Well I was thinkin' like, when Bela played "Fu Manchu."
Well I was thinkin' like, when Bela played "Fu Manchu."
That was Karloff. Paul, you gotta try harder. I don't want this film to be haif-assed. This time, we go for the quality.
...Do you accept the Lord Jesus Christ as your savior?
I do.
What are you talking about?! It's the premise of the movie. It's even the title, for Christ's sake!
Mr. Wood!
Isn't it wonderful? Bela lives!
Doesn't this strike you as a bit morbid?
Doesn't this strike you as a bit morbid?
No, he would've loved it! Bela's returned from the grave -- like Dracula. CUE VAMPIRA!
This is our choir director. He's gonna play the young hero.
