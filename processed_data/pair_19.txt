Hey, easy...
We're a long way from high school, Carl... ...and I'm scared.
You've really got to go.
Just let me get a match.
But I want you to know that I understand why you're afraid--a lot of good people down there at the Committee are afraid. I'm really sorry for what you're being put through.
All those articles you people write-- where do you find that stuff?
All those articles you people write-- where do you find that stuff?
We don't tell anyone that. Which is why you can talk to us. And if we can't verify what you say someplace else, we don't print it. That's another reason you can relax.

I'm relaxed--light your cigarette.
You were Hugh Sloan's bookkeeper when he worked for Maurice Stans at Finance, and we were sort of wondering, did you go work for Stans immediately after Sloan quit or was there a time lapse?
I never worked for Sloan or Stans.
One minute but then--
--right, right, I've got to go. Why did you lie just then?
I was just curious--you don't do it well, so I wondered. Have you been threatened, if you told the truth, is that it?
...No... never in so many words...
...No... never in so many words...
It's obvious you want to talk to someone--well, I'm someone.
There are too many people watching me--they know I know a lot--
--it was all in hundreds, wasn't it?
--it was all in hundreds, wasn't it?
A lot of it was. I just thought it was sort of an all-purpose political fund--you know, for taking fat cats to dinner, things like that.

I can't be positive that it was used for the break-in but people sure are worried.

Sloan knew which five, didn't he?
It's awfully hot-- --and you haven't finished telling me about the money--
--omigod, there was so much of it, six million came in one two-day period-- six million cash, we couldn't find enough places to put it. I thought it was all legal, I guess I did, til after the break-in, when I remembered Gordon got so much of it.

Gordon Liddy, you mean?
Gordon Liddy, you mean?
It was all so crazy--the day after the break-in he gave us a speech, bouncing up and down on his heels in that loony way of his--Gordon told us not to let Jim McCord ruin everything--don't let one bad apple spoil the barrel, he said. You just know that when Gordon Liddy's calling someone a bad apple, something's wrong somewhere. ...It's all so rotten...

Think Sloan's being set up as a fall guy for John Mitchell? Sometimes it looks that way.
Why couldn't you have just dialed me from the office, Irwin?
'Cause I'm not calling out from the phone company anymore-- --I think the place is bugged.

Irwin? I really feel bad, doing something like this--you know that, don't you?
--then again, maybe things are even worse than we've written--
--they're worse. That's why I quit.
Try and understand this. I'm a decent Republican. I believe in Richard Nixon. I worked in the White House four years--so did my wife. What happened on June 17 I don't think the President knew anything about. Some of his men I'm not so sure of.
Do you think the truth will come out at the trial?

But they both worked at the White House?

Kalmbach--Nixon's personal lawyer.
Right.
Then Barker withdrew the 25 thousand in hundred dollar bills and gave it back to Liddy who gave it back to me and I put it in the office safe which was crammed.
Ordinarily, though, what was the procedure?
Routine--I'd just call John Mitchell over at the Justice Department and he'd say "go ahead, give out the money."
What happens when the baby comes?
We're moving. I've been looking for a job but it's been... hard. My name's been in the papers too much. Sometimes I wonder if reporters understand how much pain they can inflict in just one sentence. I'm not thinking of myself. But my wife, my parents, it's been very rough on them.
I really can't talk now--
--this'll only take one second--
--this'll only take one second--
--my wife just had the baby, my in- laws are arriving, I'm trying to get the house in some kind of shape.
--I'm not your source on that--
--it's gotta be Haldeman--someone from the White House had to be involved--
--that leaves Haldeman, period.
I'm not your source on that.
--if we wrote a story that said Haldeman controlled the fund?--
--let me put it this way: I'd have no problem if you did.
Then it's our asses, isn't it?
And we'll all have to go to work for a living.
Same kind of crap--
--all non-denial denials--we're dirty guys and they doubt we were ever virgins but they don't say the story is inaccurate.
--I don't know, I don't know, it feels thin--
--Christ, I wish I knew if we should print this--
--well shit, we oughtta be tense-- we're about to accuse Mr. Haldeman who only happens to be the second most important man in America of conducting a criminal conspiracy from inside the White House-- --it would be nice if we were right--
--you double-checked both sources?--
What's this?
My non-denial denial.
I don't think either Metropolitan or National should cover the story. I don't think we should cover the story, period.
Go on.
Go on.
It's not that we're using unnamed sources that bothers me, or that everything we print the White House denies, or that almost no other papers are reprinting our stuff.
It will, it just hasn't bottomed out yet, give it time.
Ben, Jesus, there are over two thousand reporters in this town, are there five on Watergate? Where did we suddenly get all this wisdom?
Look--why would the Republicans do it? --my God, McGovern is self- destructing before our eyes--just like Muskie did, Humphrey, the bunch of 'em. Why would the burglars have put the tape around the door instead of up and down unless they wanted to get caught? Why did they take a walkie- talkie and then turn it off, unless they wanted to get caught? Why
You saying the Democrats bugged themselves?
You saying the Democrats bugged themselves?
The FBI thinks it's possible--the Democrats need a campaign issue, corruption's always a good one. Get off the story, Ben--or put some people on McGovern's finances; fair is fair, even in our business.
I was told by this guy at the White House that Hunt was investigating Teddy Kennedy.
How senior?
How senior?
You asking me to disclose my source?
Just tell me his title.
I don't know titles.
I don't know titles.
Is he on the level of Assistant to the President or not?
This is a daily paper, we'll explain it tomorrow. You're certain on Mitchell?
He approved the payments to Liddy while he was still Attorney General--
--I saw him. He verifies.
OK. You're about to write a story that says that the former Attorney General-- the man who represented law in America-- is a crook. Just be right, huh?
I got Clawsen on hold--
--his dialing finger must be falling off--

--he went to her apartment and he told her--

We can't talk inside either?
Electronic surveillance.
Anything else from Mr. Throat?
Mitchell started the cover-up early, everyone is involved in the cover- up, all the way to the top. The whole U.S. intelligence community is mixed in with the covert activities. The extent of it is incredible. And people's lives are in danger, maybe including ours.
Mr. Caddy? My name's Bob Woodward, I'm from the Post and I wanted to ask about how you happened to come on this case--
--I'm not here.
--I'm not here.
OK.
Douglas Caddy, the attorney of record, when questioned about his presence in the courtroom, denied he was in the courtroom, "I'm not here," Mr. Caddy said.
Clearly, I am here, but only as an individual, I'm not the attorney of record. Mr. Rafferty has that position. Whatever you want, you'll have to get from him, I have nothing more to say.
Mr. Rafferty was very helpful. Four Cuban-Americans and this other man, James McCord.
Look, I told you inside--
Look, I told you inside--
--you have nothing more to say, I understand that.
What I don't understand is how you got here.
I assure you, there's nothing mysterious involved.

Probably you're right, but a little while ago, I was talking to a couple of lawyers who'd been assigned to represent the burglars.

So?
So?
Well, they never would have been assigned if anyone had known the burglars had arranged for their own counsel. And that could only mean the burglars didn't arrange for their own counsel--they never even made a phone call. So if they didn't ask for you to be here, how did you know to come?
Did you know to come because one of the other men involved in the break- in called you?
There is no reason to assume other people were involved.

I'm a proper citizen, I'm a decent man, I don't do anything that isn't decent or proper. I know I shouldn't tell you this...
That twenty-five thousand dollars is money I collected for Nixon in this year's campaign.
I see. And how do you think it reached Miami?
I see. And how do you think it reached Miami?
I don't know; I really don't. The last time I saw it was when I was in Washington. I gave it to the Finance department of the Committee to Re- Elect the President. How it got to that burglar, your guess is as good as mine.

My turn to keep you waiting. What's the topic for tonight?
Ratfucking.
Ratfucking.
In my day, it was simply called the double cross. I believe the CIA refers to it as Mindfuck. In our context, it simply means infiltration of the Democrats.

Then how come the Associated Press were the ones found out that Mr. McCord is security coordinator for the Committee to Re-elect the President, otherwise known as CREEP?

The head of security for the reelection of a Republican President got caught bugging the national offices of the Democrats? What the hell does that mean?

Mr. John Mitchell, the head of CREEP, says it means nothing. "...This man and the other people involved were not operating on either our behalf or with our consent. These is no place in our campaign or in the electoral process for this type of activity, and we will not forget it or condone it."

You can't believe that.
You can't believe that.
As a rough rule of thumb, as far as I can throw Bronco Nagurski, that's how much I trust John Mitchell...
What'd you get on W.House?
Lotsa hints--

I can't sell hints to Simons-- --you called everyone you know? Call someone you don't know.
Who's Charles Colson?
I would liken your query to being in Russia half a century ago and asking someone, "I understand who Lenin is and Trotsky I got too, but who's this yokel Stalin?"

Who's Colson, Harry?
Who's Colson, Harry?
The most powerful man in America is President Nixon, probably you've heard his name.
The second most powerful man is Robert Haldeman. Just below him are a trio: Mr. Erlichman is Haldeman's friend, and they protect the President from everybody which is why they are referred to as either The German Shepherds or the Berlin Wall. Mr. Mitchell we've already discussed. Mr. Colson is the President's special counsel.
Thanks, Harry. Know anything about Colson?
Thanks, Harry. Know anything about Colson?
Just that on his office wall there's a cartoon with a caption reading, "When you've got them by the balls, their hearts and minds will follow."
Whaddya got, whaddya got?
Hunt is Colson's man-- --that's Charles Colson, Nixon's special counsel-- --they both went to Brown University-- --Hunt worked for the C.I.A. till '70, and this is on deep background, the FBI thinks he's involved with the break-in.
So?
I never asked them about Watergate. I only said what were Hunt's duties at the White House. They volunteered that he was innocent when nobody asked was he guilty.

I think we got a White House consultant linked to the bugging.
--who you got?--
--well, Sloan--
Anything?

Let me see what you get, but don't jump--The New York Times thinks it's crazy Cubans.
I can predict the next words you're gonna say: "anyone but Bernstein." I want to send a reporter to Miami.
Anyone but Bernstein.

I don't get it--you were the one who wanted to fire him.
I don't get it--you were the one who wanted to fire him.
I know, I did, but damnit Howard-- For the first time since I've known him, I think he's really humping...
--has any of them got an ax?--
--political, personal, sexual, anything at all against Mitchell?--
--listen, we didn't make them do these things--once they did, it's our job to report it--
--go over your sources again--
--listen, I love this country, you think I want to bring it down?--I'm not some goddamn zany, I was a hawk--
--Harry, weren't you just arguing the opposite way?--
--Harry, weren't you just arguing the opposite way?--
--maybe I'm tense--
More denunciations?
One Senator just gave a speech slurring us 57 times in 20 minutes.
What else have you got?
According to White House personnel, Hunt definitely works there as a consultant for Colson. But when I called the White House Press office, they said he hadn't worked there for three months. Then the P.R. guy said the weirdest thing to me. "I am convinced that neither Mr. Colson nor anyone else at the White House had any knowledge of, or participation in, this
Isn't that what you'd expect them to say?
Absolutely.
--no--
--can we use their names?--
What do you think Mrs. Graham wants to see me for?
Maybe to fire you--since you two started on this story, the Post stock has dropped, what, 50 percent? And the word is some Nixon people are challenging her TV licenses. I'm not saying she's going on relief, but I don't think it's unreasonable for her to want to meet you.

You think she wants us to ease up on the story?

I don't know, but I don't think that's unreasonable either, do you?
--which Young?
Larry Young, a California lawyer--
--and he says Chapin hired Segretti--
--well and good, but when will he say it on the record.
--well and good, but when will he say it on the record.
He just did.
Mr. Sloan?
My wife told me to expect you. As you know, I haven't talked to the press.
I'd like to talk to you, I really would, but my lawyers say I shouldn't until after the Watergate trial.
You handed out the money. Maybe there's a legitimate explanation for the way it was done--
Does "they" mean the White House?
As opposed to the Committee? The Committee's not an independent operation. Everything is cleared with the White House. I don't think that the FBI or the prosecutors understand that.

And as treasurer, you could release those funds?

When so ordered.

We're not sure we've got all the guys who could order you, but we know there were five.
Colson's too smart to get directly involved with something like that.
Haldeman. Right?
Haldeman. Right?
I won't talk about the other two.
I can't say anything, I'm sorry.
One thing I'm not completely clear on--when you gave out the money to Liddy, how did that work?
One thing I'm not completely clear on--when you gave out the money to Liddy, how did that work?
Badly. You don't realize how close all this came to staying undiscovered--I gave Liddy the Dahlberg check and he gave it to Barker who took it to Miami and deposited it.
Go on.
Well, when Liddy came and asked for money for what turned out to be the break-in funds, I went to the safe and gave him--out of this whole fortune--I happened to give him the same hundreds he gave me--banks have to keep track of hundreds. If the money had been in fifties, or if I'd grabbed a different stack, there probably wouldn't have been
A boy or a girl?
A girl. Melissa.
--and it wasn't Ehrlichman or Colson or the President.
No, none of those.
--look, when the Watergate grand jury questioned you, did you name names?
Of course--everything they asked--
Hi. I'm Bob Woodward of the Washington Post and I hate to bother you at home--
--I already get the Post. I don't need another subscription.

I'm not Miss Abbott.
What the hell was that?
Sorry.
Sorry.
No, it was good.

Oh, well... It came from the heart.
Oh, well... It came from the heart.
Well then keep it coming. Alright, people, good work! Keep it up and we'll do great at the state competition.
I'll do it.
Okay then. The rest of you okay with that?
Good work, Ostreicher.
Thanks coach.
Thanks coach.
You're a killer, Ozzy!
You're a killer, Ozzy!
-- Thanks, coach --
Christ! I didn't say you were out of the game!
Sorry, coach.
Sorry, coach.
What the fuck is this? You got someplace more important to be?
Great evening, isn't it?
Sure.
Sure.
There's something about the spring that's just cool. Like the smell of fresh rain or something.
What did you just say?
Suck me...beautiful?
Uh...you know, my friends call me Nova -- as in Casanova.
You need some work, buddy!
Look, Chris. There are just some things you need to learn, that's all.
Like what?
Alright, well...you've got to tone it down. You don't need to go to Lookout Point and spout cheeseball lines to be romantic.
...okay...
...okay...
You have to pay attention to a girl. Be sensitive to her feelings. Relationships are reciprocal.

Good morning gentleman.
Finch! Where were you last night? What happened to the foolproof plan?
Finch! Where were you last night? What happened to the foolproof plan?
I thought a fashionably late entrance would enhance my appearance. When I got here, the Bacchanalia was over and the nymphs had left.
You're just gonna sit there and drink your coffee?
Mochaccino. Actually, in the spirit of the pact, I do need to ask for your cooperation in one small matter.
Finch, don't you think it's about time you learned to take a dump at school?
When was the last time you looked at the facilities here?
Ah, Stifler's mom! Thank you for letting us have a great party.
As if there were any alternative in the matter. Are you enjoying yourself?
As if there were any alternative in the matter. Are you enjoying yourself?
I'm three sheets to the wind, ma'am!

I'm so happy for you. Takes the edge off, doesn't it? And where might your date be?
I'm so happy for you. Takes the edge off, doesn't it? And where might your date be?
Oh no, no date. Bathroom incident.

Pardon me?
...Nevermind. You have anything to drink?
I believe the kegs are upstairs.

No, no, that's what the cretins drink. I mean alcohol, liquor -- good stuff.
All right, I got some scotch.
Single malt?
Single malt?
Aged eighteen years. Why don't you get the glasses. Behind the bar.
So...would you object if I said you're quite striking?
Mister Finch -- are you trying to seduce me?
Mister Finch -- are you trying to seduce me?
Yes ma'am, I am.
I had no idea you'd be this good!
Neither did I!
This is your plan, Finch?
Yep.
This. Right now.
Uh-huh.
Of course, Finch. What?
Whatever you hear about me, you agree.
Whatever you hear about me, you agree.
What are we gonna hear?
What are we gonna hear?
You'll see. Gotta go. Sixteen minute round trip.
You know, Jim...you could go back there...and...
Seduce her.
What do you suppose they're saying?
No idea.
Finch! Get to the bathroom! Now!
Easy, tiger. What's in there?
Easy, tiger. What's in there?
Just go!
Just go!
Why is this?
Why is this?
You're gonna shit your pants!
You're gonna shit your pants!

Finch, listen -- Stifler slipped some sort of laxative in your Mocash-chino or whatever. It's fast acting. I mean <u>really</u> fast.
Finch, listen -- Stifler slipped some sort of laxative in your Mocash-chino or whatever. It's fast acting. I mean <u>really</u> fast.
First of all, it's <u>Mocha</u>ccino, and secondly...Oohhhh!
Me too. For the most part.
Nah. Fuck, you guys are right, I don't know what I'm doing. I mean I'm acting like I've got it all together tonight. But I know Vicky is gonna ask me if I love her. And I don't know what I'm gonna say. So now it's like, maybe I'll just wimp out on the whole thing.
I'll tell you, I've learned one thing: women, like wine, get better with age. Of course, I have no frame of reference for this comparison.
So Oz, you almost made it, huh?
Not bad, Chris.
Really? Hey, thanks -- Heather, right?
Really? Hey, thanks -- Heather, right?
Yeah...so...you've got this sort of... Bobby McFerrin thing going there.
Yeah...so...you've got this sort of... Bobby McFerrin thing going there.
Yeah. Right, uh-huh. I feel like I've discovered this whole new side of me. Music is so expressive.
Yeah. Right, uh-huh. I feel like I've discovered this whole new side of me. Music is so expressive.
Okay. I mean, I agree, but...aren't you supposed to be out, like, trying to decapitate someone with your lacrosse stick or something?
Oh sure. I know what people think. It's like, Oz, he's just this kickass lacrosse player -- I also play football, by the way -- But that's like...not <u>all</u> that I am.
Of course, I didn't --
Of course, I didn't --
I mean it really bothers me when people try to pigeonhole me like that.
I mean it really bothers me when people try to pigeonhole me like that.
You? You think I don't get that? God, it's like just because I don't get drunk and barf every weekend, people say "Oh, here's this goody-two- shoes choir-girl priss."
Yeah...so like, what else <u>do</u> you do?
Well the same things you do. Hang out with friends and stuff, you know, whatever. What do you think I do?
Well the same things you do. Hang out with friends and stuff, you know, whatever. What do you think I do?
I just -- realized that I didn't know anything about you. I was interested.
I just -- realized that I didn't know anything about you. I was interested.
Oh...well that's okay. Cool.
Hey, what're you doing here?
Just enjoying my exhilarating first lacrosse experience. You like, "kicked butt."

You can call me Oz.

Do I have to?

You can call me Ostreicher.

What's your middle name?
What's your middle name?
Forget it.
Forget it.
Come on! I won't tell.
Come on! I won't tell.
Neither will I.
Neither will I.
Okay. So I had this...thought, and...this may seem like it's out of left field, and I don't know if you can, but since I'm not going with anyone --
Alright, cool. I gotta hit the showers, but...I think this'll be really good.
Yeah, me too, okay, cool.
Nice car.
I'm glad you think so.
I'm glad you think so.
You don't like it?
You don't like it?
No, I like the car. By the way, though, about prom? That was like a bad idea. Sorry I invited you.
What?!
Oh, please. I asked you because I thought you might actually be worth going with. But you are just a jock. No wait. You're a jerk.
Oh, please. I asked you because I thought you might actually be worth going with. But you are just a jock. No wait. You're a jerk.
What? No I'm not.
What? No I'm not.
I saw you making fun of me with your lacrosse buddies.
I saw you making fun of me with your lacrosse buddies.
I wasn't making fun of you.
I wasn't making fun of you.
Give me a break, you're so full of it.
Why are you doing this?
Because I want to.
Because I want to.
Yeah? Well you can't fake your way through this. You better practice.
Hi...
How did you know I was here?
How did you know I was here?
Stifler told me.
Stifler told me.
You talked to Stifler?
You talked to Stifler?
Well...I needed to find you. We are gonna have to practice that song.
Well...I needed to find you. We are gonna have to practice that song.
...okay. Cool then. I'm um, I'm glad you came by. I mean, really.
Uh...my dad's the manager.
Really? Cool. Tell him his subs are great.
Really? Cool. Tell him his subs are great.
Ah, he's always too heavy on the vinegar. If you really want a good one, you gotta let me make it.
My dad's always here running the store, busy and stuff...and I fill in once a week so he can get a night off.
That's nice.
That's nice.
So you're going to Michigan?
So you're going to Michigan?
Yeah, well my parents wanted me to go to Northwestern. I didn't want to write all those extra essays they make you do -- I mean, how am I supposed to know what my "most emotionally significant moment" was? So when my U of M acceptance came in December, I said the hell with it.

Well, State's got a good business school. And I can probably walk onto the lacrosse team. Green peppers?

Yeah. So wow, you've got it figured out.
Yeah. So wow, you've got it figured out.

Oh thank God, I thought I was the only one.

Well, you're not. Oil and vinegar?
Well, you're not. Oil and vinegar?
Yeah. You know, people are always like, "What're you gonna major in?" And I don't know. And they're like, "You'll figure it out." Yeah? When?

So we're gonna be close next year?
You -- oh, you mean -- yeah, East Lansing and Ann Arbor.
You -- oh, you mean -- yeah, East Lansing and Ann Arbor.
...yeah.
...I've got this lacrosse game. It's really important, it's our last game. And you know, Central almost beat us last time, so I really want to kick their ass, and it's like cool because we're gonna get to play at State, which means that after the game I might be able to stop by...
You can't sing at the competition.
You can't sing at the competition.
I'm sorry, I totally spaced. I just...I didn't realize it...
I'm sorry, I totally spaced. I just...I didn't realize it...
...it's okay, you should do whatever makes you happy.
...it's okay, you should do whatever makes you happy.
Alright...yeah...thanks for understanding. So I guess...I'll see you later.
What about the game?!
I'm not playing.
I'm not playing.
You're missing the game for us?!
You're missing the game for us?!
No. I'm missing the game for you.
There's something I've been meaning to tell you, Heather.
What's that?
What's that?
It's gonna sound really bad, but I want you to know.
This isn't the best way to proposition me.
No, that's not what I mean. I mean -- look. You know what made me leave that game? Coach was giving this speech, about not slacking off when you see the opportunity to score.
No, that's not what I mean. I mean -- look. You know what made me leave that game? Coach was giving this speech, about not slacking off when you see the opportunity to score.
This isn't any better, Chris.
This isn't any better, Chris.
No, see Heather, what I realized is that...with you, it's not like I'm running towards the goal, trying to figure out the best way to score. And this may sound corny, but --
Oz, it's okay, I know.
You called me Oz.
You called me Oz.
Well, that's what your friends call you. I mean...I feel like I'm one of your friends now...and also...your girlfriend.
Hmm. You know that's really a shitty middle name!
I know, it sucks!
I can't think of anything to say that's not cheesy.
Then don't.
Vanderbilt's not that far from U of M.
Yeah right.
Yeah right.
What? We both have cars.
What? We both have cars.
Yeah but, no offense, you're talking about a post-high school, long- distance relationship, and you and Kevin haven't even done it yet.

Jessica! He'll drive there for me, and I'll drive to Ann Arbor for him. We're going to have sex when he's ready and I'm ready. It's got to be completely perfect. I want the right place, the right time, the right moment.

Vicky, it's not a space shuttle launch, it's sex. So did you do the physics write-up?
Vicky, it's not a space shuttle launch, it's sex. So did you do the physics write-up?
Please.
He likes it.
Of course he does. What about you? Have you just never had one with Kevin -- or have you never had one, period?
Of course he does. What about you? Have you just never had one with Kevin -- or have you never had one, period?
I think I've had one.
I think I've had one.
Well that's a no. No wonder you're not psyched about sex. You've never even had one manually?
Well that's a no. No wonder you're not psyched about sex. You've never even had one manually?
...I've never tried it.
...I've never tried it.
Are you kidding? You've never double- clicked your mouse?
Jessica, can you drive me home?
Sure.
Ah, you'll get her back soon enough. That's easy, she likes you. What you need to do is learn to press a girl's buttons. You gotta give her what she's never had.
What?
What?
I'll give you a hint. "Ohhh, yeah, yeah!" Comprende?
I'll give you a hint. "Ohhh, yeah, yeah!" Comprende?
You mean...and orgasm?

You got it, stud.

Well...I'm pretty sure I've --
Well...I'm pretty sure I've --
No you haven't.
No you haven't.
But that one time --
But that one time --
No.
No.
Well of course I'd want to give her that. I mean, what do you think, I don't care about her?
Well of course I'd want to give her that. I mean, what do you think, I don't care about her?
Do you?
Do you?
Of course.
Of course.
Do you love her?
I -- I don't know, you can't ask me that.
Well, if you want to get her in the sack, tell her you love her. That's how I was duped.
Well, if you want to get her in the sack, tell her you love her. That's how I was duped.
I don't want to dupe her, Jessica. If I say it, I have to be sure I mean it.
I don't want to dupe her, Jessica. If I say it, I have to be sure I mean it.
Well it's up to you. The Big L, or the Big O.
No comment.
No comment?! Are you kidding me?! I've never seen someone's image change so...so drastically!
No comment?! Are you kidding me?! I've never seen someone's image change so...so drastically!
Thanks. It was my idea.
Thanks. It was my idea.
Did you guys hook up or something?
Did you guys hook up or something?
Are you kidding? No.
Are you kidding? No.
Then what the hell are you talking about?
Then what the hell are you talking about?
Well...I guess it's okay for me to tell you now. That reputation of his isn't going anywhere. Finch comes to me and says, "Jessica, I need help with this, blah blah, etcetera." So I told him, pay me two- hundred bucks, and I'll tell a couple girls that you're dynamite in bed. So he did, and I did.

I don't get it, that really works?
I don't get it, that really works?
Duh. Of course. Naturally, I embellished a little bit. Hey, did you hear that Finch had sex with an older woman?
Oooh, yeah. Oh, baby, you're so good.
Yeah, I'm the best, baby.
Give it to me! Yes!
Oh yeah, baby, I'll give it to you.
Don't you love my sexy body?!
I do, baby, I do.
You're so big!
Yeah, that's right.
Fuck me! Yes!
Uh...
And you said...
Nothing, I just hugged her back.
Nothing, I just hugged her back.
You think she was serious?
You think she was serious?
I couldn't tell -- She could've meant like, "I love you grandma" or "I love you Vanderbilt."
There's our man.
Finch, you got the Latin homework?
Unlisted age, plus "youthful mind," equals old.
No, "Charming" is old. "Older" is <u>really</u> old. "Youthful mind" is dead.
Alright...I'm shooting for a nine o'clock ETA. Beer in hand by five after.
You can crash at Stifler's?
You can crash at Stifler's?
It's all good. Breath check.
At least now I know what the hell they're saying.
So, does my hair look better -- like this, or... like this?
What about you? You're the one with the girlfriend and you're still stranded on third base.
You know, I've never got that shit. What exactly constitutes third base?
Gotta go.
But --
Ow, what the hell?
Sorry, I thought you were dead.
Like a bet?
No, a <u>pact</u>. No money involved. This is more important than any bet. Now here's the deal: We all get laid before we graduate.
That's what we are, we keep each other on track. Prior to this day, we've postured. We've procrastinated. We've pretended. We've -- well I can't think of other p-words, but we've probably done them too.
Pontificated.
Pontificated.
Separately, we are flawed and vulnerable. But together, we are the masters of our sexual destiny!
Separately, we are flawed and vulnerable. But together, we are the masters of our sexual destiny!
Their tiger-style kung-fu is strong; but our dragon style will defeat it!
Yeah, it's like tradition or something.
Right. That gives us...
Right. That gives us...
Exactly three weeks to the day.
I have no idea. Finch showers in a bathing suit.
No -- it's true. He is...really... big.
No -- it's true. He is...really... big.
Yeah, enormous.
Hey, where's Finch?
Went home to shit.
Went home to shit.
I don't get it. How does a guy like that get this sudden reputation?
You can send me the address too.
Well...dammit, if I'm doing this, how the hell am I gonna watch?
Well...dammit, if I'm doing this, how the hell am I gonna watch?
I'll save you a seat.
Did I miss anything?!
Just in time.
But, but -- what would I do?
Anything! Just tell her it looks like she needs an extra hand or something.
Anything! Just tell her it looks like she needs an extra hand or something.
That's stupid.
That's stupid.
No, you're stupid. Get going! Right now! She's primed!
No, you're stupid. Get going! Right now! She's primed!
Oh...oh...oh, shit!
Oh boy oh God oh crap oh no.
Come on, Jim. Where are you?
Please, God. Let this be it.
He's going in!
Holy shit.
Holy shit!
Hey, minuteman.
Shut up. You're supposed to be supportive.
How do you know that?
She's already on a plane back home.
Yeah? Well come prom night, those excuses aren't going to do you much good.
Jesus, Kevin, rub it in.
Yeeeeeeeaaaawwwwww!
You fuckin' rule!
Alright, how do you guys stand? Well, Finch, I know where you are, but you can't use that as an excuse. Jim?
My date's a flute-toting band dork. That answer your question?
My date's a flute-toting band dork. That answer your question?
Oz, how about you and Heather? Now you guys are a couple or something?
Back out? You don't need <u>us</u> to get laid. You afraid or something?
No, but come on guys, we made a pact!
Kevin, come on, the bus to Stifler's is gonna be here soon.
I'm not going.
No, no that's fine. So you doing okay?
Yeah.
What the heck is this?
Nothing!
Can I come in?
Yeah, sure.
Yeah, sure.
You're not...busy?
You're not...busy?
Dad, come in.
Okay.
These are for you. From father to son.
I know, Dad.
Oh, okay. Here's let me show you.
Dad! I know!
Do you know about the clitoris?
Do you know about the clitoris?
Yes dad.
Yes dad.
Sometimes it can be pretty hard to locate.
Sometimes it can be pretty hard to locate.
Thank you, dad, I got it.
Thank you, dad, I got it.
Okay, well that about covers it.
Jim?
It's not what it looks like!
Dad, please stop. Please. I'm sure I know what you're talking about.
Sure you know, son, but I think you've been having a little problem with it. It's okay, though. What you're doing is perfectly normal. It's like practice. Like when you play tennis against a wall. Some day, there'll be a partner returning the ball. You do want a partner, don't you son?

Yes.
Yes.
That's great. Now remember, it's <u>okay</u> to play with yourself. Or, as I always called it -- "Stroke the salami!" Ho-ho, Jim. There's nothing to be ashamed of. Hell, I'm fifty-two, and I still enjoy masturbating. Uncle Mort masturbates. We <u>all</u> masturbate.
Son. This lady's here for you.
I know. Hey Nadia.
Dad.
Oh, no, not too much of a bookworm. He's a good little kid. Er, guy. Man.
Oh, no, not too much of a bookworm. He's a good little kid. Er, guy. Man.
Dad!!
Dad!!
Okay, okay. I'll let you hit those books.
Hold on. You have no idea why I'm angry?
Is it because we have a test tomorrow? Sometimes I get cranky when I know I have a big test to study for.
Is it because we have a test tomorrow? Sometimes I get cranky when I know I have a big test to study for.
Yeah, that's pretty much it.
Yeah, that's pretty much it.
I thought so. Because, one time? I was at this --

What was your name again?

Michelle.
Michelle.
Okay. Michelle, do you want to be my date for the prom?
Okay. Michelle, do you want to be my date for the prom?
Really? You seriously want to go with me?
Really? You seriously want to go with me?
Yes. Seriously.
Yes. Seriously.
Are we going to Steve Stifler's party afterwards? That would be so cool.
Are we going to Steve Stifler's party afterwards? That would be so cool.
Whatever you want.
Whatever you want.
Cool! We're gonna have so much fun! It's like this one time, at band camp...
You know, at band camp? We have dances like this. Only they're way funner. Don't you think prom is just highly overrated?
Highly, highly overrated.
Stifler's mom got it in the divorce.
It reminds me of this one time -- Hey, can I ask you a question? How come you don't have any stories? I've got lots of stories, and you don't have any.
It reminds me of this one time -- Hey, can I ask you a question? How come you don't have any stories? I've got lots of stories, and you don't have any.
Oh, I've got stories, believe me. They're a little more risque than tales of Band Camp.
Oh, I've got stories, believe me. They're a little more risque than tales of Band Camp.
Are they gross or something, like guy stuff? Tell me.
Are they gross or something, like guy stuff? Tell me.
Okay. You want a story? Here's a story. Stifler finds this beer, right? And...
That is a <u>nasty</u> story!
I told you.
I told you.
You wanna hear a nasty story of mine? It's kind of sexual.
Yeah, bring it on!
Well, this one time? At band camp? We were playing this game, I don't know if you know it? But it's called spin the bottle? And I had to kiss this guy named Marc Wander on the lips? And...
So, the end of the story is...you had to kiss the guy for twenty seconds?
Yes! And he was such a dork! And everyone laughed at me, but I didn't care? Because it was so funny!
Yes! And he was such a dork! And everyone laughed at me, but I didn't care? Because it was so funny!
Okay, I get it.
Okay, I get it.
Oh! And then this one time? At band camp? I stuck a flute in my pussy.
...excuse me?!
What, you think I don't know how to get myself off? Hell, that's what half of band camp is! Sex ed!
This'll do.
Now, I have two rubbers. Wear them both, it'll desensitize you. I don't want you coming so damn early.
Now, I have two rubbers. Wear them both, it'll desensitize you. I don't want you coming so damn early.
Why, uh, what makes you think that I --
Why, uh, what makes you think that I --
Come on. I saw you on the net. Why do you think I accepted this date? You're a sure thing!
Are you gonna do what I think you're gonna do?
Don't you want me to?
Don't you want me to?
Oh yeah! Put it in your mouth!
Oh yeah! Put it in your mouth!
Okay!
Illegal channels? Shit, if there's any channel that should be illegal, it's whatever that women's channel is. Lifetime Supply of Pantyhose, or some shit.

Is there anything you don't jerk off to?
Is there anything you don't jerk off to?
C-Span?
You guys got the Latin homework?
No -- Kevin, you?
Ooh, here's an easy one: "Attractive SWF, fun loving and a youthful mind seeks outgoing companion." Okay..."Attractive"...ugly.
"Fun loving" -- insane.
This was remade? Into what?
Bli-hinded by the light -- cut loose like a deuce, another runner in the night, blinded...
Who cares?
Nadia does, that Czechoslovakian chick, she might be there tonight. Now, do you think she'd prefer -- Cool Hip Jim... or Laid Back Jim?
Shortstop. 'Course, you don't make it to third, and you're out.
So let's say you get there...what's uh, third base feel like?
Feels like warm apple pie, dude.
Apple pie... McDonald's or homemade?
Hey, you did better than I did, Nova.
Oh that's really reassuring. And don't call me Nova anymore. I'm a fraud.
Hey guys, you came to watch me in action?
Yeah, I think you sounded pretty good.
You can do that?
Oh -- no way. I can't do that to her.
You've still got a chance with Nadia, right?
No. Her sponsors here saw the thing on the net. I don't think they liked it.
I still think you're okay.
So do I, Kev.
There it is. I want to grab my bag. Oh, and my date.
Come on, Kevin. Vicky's looking for you.
I'll just say that we had a great night together.
Hang in there, buddy, you'll get there.
Hang in there, buddy, you'll get there.
I know.
It's true. I mean, after this, everything'll be different.
After getting laid?
After getting laid?
After high school.
What's up, fellas?
Hey Sherman. Scopin' the babes.
Hey Sherman. Scopin' the babes.
Indeed. Some fine ladies here, boys. Confidence is high, repeat, confidence is high. Sherman is moving to DefCon Two, full strategic arsenal ready for deployment.

You've got something going?
You've got something going?
Did you see that Central chick? Brunette?
You did it.
Fellas, say goodbye to Chuck Sherman, the boy. I am now a man.
Yes.
I thought so.
No...you...go...ahead.
Okay.
You are very good in the world history class, yes?
Me?
Yes. No. Yes.
Perhaps you can help me with my studies?
Okay...that would be cool sometime. How 'bout tomorrow?
Well, I do have ballet practice. Perhaps I can come by your house afterwards. I can change clothes at your place?
Well, I do have ballet practice. Perhaps I can come by your house afterwards. I can change clothes at your place?
I suppose that would be okay.
So you need to change, right?
Do you mind? This fabric is so uncomfortable.
James! You have come in here on purpose?!
Well...uh...
Well...uh...
Shame on you!
Shame on you!
Uh...yeah...sorry.
Uh...yeah...sorry.
Well. You have seen me. Now it is my turn to see you. Strip.
Well. You have seen me. Now it is my turn to see you. Strip.
Strip?
Strip?
Yes, slowly.
You mean like, <u>strip</u> strip?
For me?
Uh...
Move with the music.
Move with the music.
Um...okay...
No, no, you must put your whole body into it.
Nadia, I can't --
Nadia, I can't --
Can't what? Do you not want to be with me? I wish to be entertained, James.
Jim...
Oh no.
You are done, James. Perhaps I should be going now.
No, no, I'm not done! I've got reserves! Nadia, please please please. I'm begging you.
Did you see this? This is your more exotic dirty magazine.
Yes...James, it is knowing that these beautiful women arouse you that arouses me...
Yes...James, it is knowing that these beautiful women arouse you that arouses me...
Oh yes. Very arousing women. They arouse me very much. But not as arousing as you.
No, not again.
I am sorry, Jim. I suppose we will not be doing any studying now.
I am sorry, Jim. I suppose we will not be doing any studying now.
No! I've got...reserve reserves!
Stifler, you're such an asshole.
Meyers, what's the deal with you and Vicky, anyway? You've been going out since Homecoming and all she'll do is blow you? Shit, I'd drop her like a steaming turd.
SUCK ME, BEAUTIFUL!
God dammit, Stifler!
God dammit, Stifler!
Check-out time! Please vacate the room.
Ho-lee shit.
This just got a hell of a lot better.
Kevin! You seen Shitbreak lately?
Oh no, Stifler, what did you do?
Oh no, Stifler, what did you do?
Me? Nothing. I'm the one whose ass he kicked. I'll tell you one thing, though. I don't think he's gonna have a problem shitting in school anymore.
It's a big, thick envelope, Vicky. You got in.
You think so?
"Dear Ms. Hughes. We're sorry, but after keeping you on the wait list for the past couple months, we've decided you are now rejected. Enclosed is a 100-page, full-color brochure on how rejected you are."
Kevin, this is serious!
Kevin, this is serious!
You got in.
Oh, Kev.
Vicky -- do you think, maybe...it's time for us to take the next step in our relationship?
Vicky -- do you think, maybe...it's time for us to take the next step in our relationship?
Tonight?
Tonight?
Yeah, it's such a perfect evening. Isn't this how you've always pictured it?
Let me know.
Okay, don't stop.
Vicky, wait.
Not for you.
I was being selfish. And majorly insensitive. And I'm a total idiot.
I think "shithead" really says it.
I think "shithead" really says it.
Yes! I'm a shithead! I'm a complete and total shithead!
And I want to try to make it up to you.
How?
Oh...ungghhhhh!
Shhhh. Your parents are downstairs.
Oh Kevin -- don't stop!
Just a second!
You're not doing the extra credit problems.
No, I'm not. I'm writing a sequence of random numbers that look like I'm doing the extra credit problems. Mr. Bender doesn't bother to check homework past April.
No, I'm not. I'm writing a sequence of random numbers that look like I'm doing the extra credit problems. Mr. Bender doesn't bother to check homework past April.
That's my trick!
That's my trick!
It's everyone's trick, Kevin. But I did pick it up from you.
We've come a long way since Homecoming.
Yeah, we have. You corrupted my four- point into a three-nine-five.
Yeah, we have. You corrupted my four- point into a three-nine-five.
Indeed I did. But, our relationship. It's progressed a lot. It's time for us to...express ourselves in new ways.
Like how?
Well, I feel that...things are getting to that point in a relationship. When two people share...a special moment between them.
Well, I feel that...things are getting to that point in a relationship. When two people share...a special moment between them.
I think you're so right, Kevin.
I think you're so right, Kevin.
You want to do it?
You want to do it?
Yes --
Kevin? Do you not love me?
No, I don't not love you. I like, I know that we've definitely got <u>something</u> between us. Something good. Something special.
No, I don't not love you. I like, I know that we've definitely got <u>something</u> between us. Something good. Something special.
But you don't love me.
But you don't love me.
I didn't say that. I mean, love, it's like a term that gets thrown around. People say things, they get married, have kids, and then what? It's like they call it off, going "I was wrong."
Kevin...you're not your dad. The two of us, we're not your parents.
I know, Vick. I'm just not ready yet, okay?
I know, Vick. I'm just not ready yet, okay?
Okay.
Hey...
Did you know that it's...450 miles from Ann Arbor to Nashville?
Did you know that it's...450 miles from Ann Arbor to Nashville?
It's like a six or seven hour drive. That's easy, I don't mind driving.
About the other day...I've been thinking.
So have I. And I know you want to make things perfect for me. And I understand that you really wouldn't tell me that until you were 100% comfortable with it.
And I want to make things perfect for you. You're right, Kev, we do have something good...and special.
Yeah, we have something great, Vick.
Yeah, we have something great, Vick.
Kevin... I want to have sex with you.
Now?!
No...I know the perfect time...
See -- this is the nicest room.
Wow, Kev...it's perfect.
You comfortable?
Yeah, are you?
Yeah, are you?
Yeah.
You sure you're comfortable?
Yeah. Are you sure?
Yeah. Are you sure?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Me too.
Me too.
Okay. Did you bring a condom?
Okay. Did you bring a condom?
Yeah, right here.
So, do you want to be -- I mean, how do you want to do it?
I don't know. How do you?
I don't know. How do you?
Like, normal style. The...missionary position.
Like, normal style. The...missionary position.
Okay.
Yeah Vick?
I want to hear you say it.
I want to hear you say it.
Okay.
Victoria...I love you.
I love you.
That was a great night.
Yeah.
I can't believe we just had our senior prom.
Yeah, the time went by so fast.
Yeah, the time went by so fast.
It did.
Kevin, next year...with you in Ann Arbor, and me in Nashville...it's not gonna work, is it.
Don't say that, we can do it somehow. It might not be perfect, but --
Don't say that, we can do it somehow. It might not be perfect, but --
No, Kevin -- That's the whole thing, that's what I've been realizing. That nothing's perfect, that you can't plan everything.
Vicky...last night...I wasn't lying.
I know. Let's go. Don't you have something to tell your friends?
I know. Let's go. Don't you have something to tell your friends?
What?
What?
Your little pact. Jessica told me all about it. Way to go, Kev!
You called me to ask me how to get laid?
What was I gonna do, call dad? I don't even know his number.
What was I gonna do, call dad? I don't even know his number.
Just dial 976-Asshole.
Just dial 976-Asshole.
Yeah, well anyway...I thought you might have some advice, brother to brother. I mean, I think tonight she might, we might really, there's a chance that -- you know.
Yeah, well anyway...I thought you might have some advice, brother to brother. I mean, I think tonight she might, we might really, there's a chance that -- you know.
Have you ever heard of the bible?
Have you ever heard of the bible?
What? Not <u>the</u> Bible?
What? Not <u>the</u> Bible?
Well, that's not really the name, but we always called it that.
Well, that's not really the name, but we always called it that.
Does it tell me how to get laid?
Does it tell me how to get laid?
You know what, nevermind. You're not ready.
You know what, nevermind. You're not ready.
Ready for what?
Ready for what?
Whoop, you're fading out. Good luck at that party.
Say that again, Kevin?
Uh...I thought you might know a trick or something. To make her, you know...
Try the spicy tuna hand roll.
What?! How do I do that?
What?! How do I do that?
Uh -- forget that. Look, is that all you're interested in? Ways to get your girlfriend into bed?
Uh -- forget that. Look, is that all you're interested in? Ways to get your girlfriend into bed?
Well, no. I think...I guess it would be good to be able to return the favor. I mean, it would be nice to know she enjoys things as much as I do.
Well, no. I think...I guess it would be good to be able to return the favor. I mean, it would be nice to know she enjoys things as much as I do.
That's good, that's what I needed to hear. Now you qualify.
That's good, that's what I needed to hear. Now you qualify.
Qualify for what?
Qualify for what?
You've just inherited The Bible.
Hey. I got another question for you.
What's that?
Then she said -- she loves me.
Oh shit dude, the L-word!
You ever hear of something called The Bible?
Once, in church, dude.
Dude, I wish you wouldn't do that.
You got something up your sleeve for tonight, Finch?
And little hurly-burly came by in her curly-wurly, and asked me if I needed I ri-hide --
How the hell do you know all these random songs?
How the hell do you know all these random songs?
It's early Springsteen, dude, this is classic. This was before the cheesy remake.
Contact, dude.
Then where does a blowjob figure in?
Feeling better, Oz?
I'm such a loser.
I'm such a loser.
That's the spirit.
I put in months of quality time with Vicky. Sherman meets a chick for one night and scores? This is just wrong.
No shit, I'm never gonna get laid. How the hell am I gonna become this Mr. Sensitive Man?
Dude, it's not like I haven't been trying to get laid.
This is different. This is better. Think of when you're working out, Oz. You need a partner, someone to spot you. Someone to keep you motivated.
The Sha-lin masters from east and west must unite!
Guys, guys -- you're ruining my fucking moment here. Now think about it --
So, I'm thinking prom is basically our last big chance.
Dude, prom sucks.
Dude, prom sucks.
I know, but think about it -- At the parties that night. Chicks are gonna want to do it.
So does your tongue cramp up?
Nah, you get kind of dizzy though.
What reputation?
Observe.
Okay, explain.
I can't, I have no idea how he's doing it. And that leaves you trailing, Jim. You gotta get your act together.
Dammit, Kevin, what's with the attitude?
Attitude? Me? I think that <u>you</u> guys should be more enthusiastic. Shit, we've been trying to get laid forever, and tonight's the night we've been waiting for. We're in this together. Don't back out on me now!
Kevin, it was just a --
<u>It was a pact</u>. You break it and there are no excuses. You guys have to --
...Guess what?
I don't care.
And by the way, Sherman didn't even get laid.
He didn't?
I guess we'll call you two-ply.
Yeah. So you want double condiments on that?
Wow. You two really have something going, don't you?
I think we're falling in love.
Yeah, but we'll still see each other.
Fuck yeah we will.
NOVA!!
Stifler!!
You coming to party tonight, Ostreicher, ya fuckface?
Depends if my date wants to stop by.
Depends if my date wants to stop by.
That junior chick?
That junior chick?
Nah, gave her the Heisman. I'm working on something new.
Nah, gave her the Heisman. I'm working on something new.
Yeah right. I got an idea for something new. How 'bout you guys actually locate your dicks, remove the shrink wrap, and fuckin' use 'em.
Yeah right. I got an idea for something new. How 'bout you guys actually locate your dicks, remove the shrink wrap, and fuckin' use 'em.
Dude, it's gotta happen -- she's a college chick!
Dude, it's gotta happen -- she's a college chick!
Bullshit. From where?

She works part-time at my dad's store.
She works part-time at my dad's store.
Hah! Yeah, Oz, I bet it's more like your dad works at <u>her</u> store.
Hah! Yeah, Oz, I bet it's more like your dad works at <u>her</u> store.
Dude, he does not.
You actually said that?! Haaaah!!
Shut the fuck up.
I think you need your balls reattached.
Keep it down, dude.
Keep it down, dude.
What the fuck are you doing here?
What the fuck are you doing here?
This place is an untapped resource. Check it out, dude, these vocal jazz girls are <u>hot</u>.
You dipshit, you're expecting to score with some goody-goody choir-girl priss?
Dude, watch me work. They go for sensitive studs like me.
<u>Yeah</u>!
Well, just don't expect Oz to pay for the limo.
Well, just don't expect Oz to pay for the limo.
Stifler, fuck -- ...man, you don't have to be so insensitive.
Hey, you know, what can I say, I dig those cute little sweaters she wears.
I'll bet you do, you little horndog, she's givin' you fuckin' stiffies, right?
Oh my fucking God. You're gay.
Come on, you know the words, sing along.
Come on, you know the words, sing along.
No thanks, you've been singing that shit all week. If you try that at MSU this Saturday, I'm pretending I don't know you.
Our last game is this Saturday.
No shit.
God, I can't believe there are so many cool people at this party.
Yep.
Here, babe.
Thanks.
Really?
Uh huh.
I don't know if I want to be doing this.
Doing what?
You know. If we hook up, tomorrow I'll just be some girl you go telling all your friends about.
No way.
Hanging is nice. Never goes out of style. What about hare-kare - a taste of the Orient? But no! You're in Paris! Try the Guillotine! There's one in the Louvre!
I'd use pills. They're painless.
I'd use pills. They're painless.
Oh give me a break! He could use pills back in America! Why not get a little culture?
Let's face it. It's a, how do you say... mother-fucker. But we're all in it together. That's why we're trying to help you.
Exactly.
Merde! Just missed!
Uhh! Would you die already!
Geez, I feel bad for him. Maybe we should've told him abou -
Are you crazy!? You know that's totally impractical. Besides, like the Bible says... An eye for an eye...
Look, the more you think about it, the harder it is.
Just like sex with my wife.
Just like sex with my wife.
The key is don't look down.
The key is don't look down.
Also like sex with my wife.
Also like sex with my wife.
Would you shut up?
Tell you what, we'll jump together.
Sure. We wouldn't ask you to do anything we wouldn't do. Now give me your hand... that's it...
Merde! I can't believe this!
You try to be a good sport, and look what happens.
I mean, if by some miracle you can find the werewolf that bit you, and then manage to eat it's heart, the curse is lifted. I was gonna tell you but Marcel wouldn't let me.
Oh sure, it was all mean old Marcel's idea. Give me a break! We didn't tell you because it's a wild goose chase! Not to mention disgusting. Look...
Either way works for us...
But you better hurry.
Actually, I'm waiting for someone.
What a coincidence, I am someone! Mmm. Calvin Klein's Obsession. Now it's mine too.
God. How can you eat like that?
It's all in the tongue. Another bottle?
Wow. You know Kung Fu or something?
Yeah. Apparently.
Ha ha. You were probably right about his mom.
Hope I didn't hurt him too bad.
Hope I didn't hurt him too bad.
Who gives a shit? I've had it up to here with arrogant Frenchmen.
Who gives a shit? I've had it up to here with arrogant Frenchmen.
Up to there? Really? I bet I could beat that.

Ah. The mating call of the blonde. The night is young, the moon is bright, whataya feel like doing tonight?
I don't know... Surprise me.
Ahh! Jesus! You're burning hot! What the hell -
AHHHHHHH!
Thanks for the lovely evening, shithead!
Aaaaa! Jesus! This isn't happening. I'm still hallucinating. Shit!
Face it boyfriend. This is really happening.
No it isn't! You're dead!
Okay... dead or undead... what do you want from me?
A-duh... You're a werewolf. And we, as your victims, have to walk the earth until your curse is lifted.
A-duh... You're a werewolf. And we, as your victims, have to walk the earth until your curse is lifted.
Uh huh... And, supposing I believed that, what could I do about it?
Look, I didn't mean to hurt anybody... God, I didn't mean to... to...
Rip my face off? Hey, we all make mistakes. Hell, I didn't mean to sleep with you on the first night, especially without a condom. But I did, and now I'm paying the price.
Hey, you can't kick me! You're an apparition!
What, all of a sudden you got a degree in supernatural law?
Ha-ha!
Oh, big man. You can beat up a couple of cadavers. Well let me make something real clear, asshole. If you don't kill yourself, at midnight tonight you're gonna transform and murder innocent people!
Oh fuck, you are his nephew...
Yeah, that's the word. And you are?
Yeah, that's the word. And you are?
Serafine Flocquet. I work for your uncle.
Serafine Flocquet. I work for your uncle.
You? You're Madame Flocquet? I pictured a fat lady with an apron, not - I don't know - La Femme Nikita.
Sure. I can follow that.
It's a fucking nightmare, isn't it?
It's a fucking nightmare, isn't it?
Yeah. True. The cops weren't much help either. Their theory is he was moonlighting as a drug dealer or something. Make sense to you?
Yeah. True. The cops weren't much help either. Their theory is he was moonlighting as a drug dealer or something. Make sense to you?
Police. They have their head in their asshole and they still can't find shit.
Police. They have their head in their asshole and they still can't find shit.
Well put. So, what exactly has uncle Terrence been up to lately?
Salots! Shitfucker!
What?
What?
If you leave it for more than a few minutes it locks up. Now I must reboot and type a dozen fucking passwords. He was security crazy.
You must not have known him very well. He's not like that.
Hey, Sorry if I was out of line.
Hey, Sorry if I was out of line.
You were. I have work to do. The publisher wants the transcripts by Monday. Go. Make yourself at home.
You were. I have work to do. The publisher wants the transcripts by Monday. Go. Make yourself at home.
Fine. My mistake. You know, I'm gonna be a writer myself some day.
Fine. My mistake. You know, I'm gonna be a writer myself some day.
Uh-huh. Good for you.
Medusa... What's this? some kind of club?
It's nothing. A stupid party. Not really a night club, it's, uh...
It's nothing. A stupid party. Not really a night club, it's, uh...
Like an underground club?
Like an underground club?
Yes. It's a bad place. Weird people. Strange things go on.
Yes. It's a bad place. Weird people. Strange things go on.
And who's Claude?
Professor Claude Rousel. The one your uncle was working with. He teaches cultural history.
In an underground club? I'd like to see that.
I'm serious. There's nothing for you down there. It's dangerous.
Come on. I'm from New York - the "shoot me" state. Don't wait up.
What good can you do? Why are you being so fucking stupid?
Maybe I didn't know him like you did. But he's my uncle. And I owe it to him to get some answers. It's a quest like, uh, Hemingway, the Old Man and The Sea. Except instead of an old man I'm a young man, and instead of the sea, it's a bunch of tunnels under Paris. And instead of a big fish it's... who
Wait a second, are you like the Steven King of France or something...
Andy!
So you came after all. Just in time, it's getting interesting.
You must get out of here. It's not safe.
Andy! Holy shit!
Serafine...?
Thank God! What a relief! I thought... After you disappeared... I couldn't find you... I thought all sorts of horrible things...
Yeah... Ditto. I saw, er, I thought I saw you get munched... like Uncle Terrence...
What happened? Did you cut yourself?
Um... sort of... Maybe... It's all kind of blurry. We met at the club, then... Damn, that was some weird shit.
You have to be a hero. All Americans think they are cowboys.
I was an Indian, actually. Man, that damn psycho paint...! If that's supposed to be mild, I don't want to know about medium. The planet earth. It's good to be back.
I was an Indian, actually. Man, that damn psycho paint...! If that's supposed to be mild, I don't want to know about medium. The planet earth. It's good to be back.
So... you feel okay now?
Fan-fucking-tastic?
Hey, what more could I want? I survived my first and last hallucinogenic hellride, and neither of us is dead. I'd say I feel almost as great as you look.
Come on Serafine. Let's go out. Show me the real Paris, the part that isn't overpriced and overrun with German tourists.
Go to Jim Morrison's grave at Pere Lachaise. It's overrun with American tourists. I have to work.
Go to Jim Morrison's grave at Pere Lachaise. It's overrun with American tourists. I have to work.
I know! Let's go hock loogies off the Eiffel Tower!
What about food? Even beautiful women have to eat. It's true. I read it. Please? A half an hour? My treat? Pleez! Don't make go out there alone again! I'm begging you!
Okay. But I'm back in half an hour.
What about your glasses?
It's okay. I can see fine.
Don't you want to change?
Man! Our first date and already you're trying to get me to change! You French women work quick!
Shit! You bought enough pate for a fucking army!
So tell me, exactly which truck driver did you study English with?
Like I should talk. Monsieur foot-in- the-mouth. I'm really sorry about that whole Woody Allen thing...
So's Woody Allen. No, your uncle really helped me. I was sort of messed up for a while. Wasting my time just partying and... just stupid shit. He kind of woke me up, gave me a job, got me taking classes. You know, he and Claude, their work is controversial, but they're serious about it. Totally dedicated.

That's what counts. If you're not passionate about it, don't waste your time. That's why I quit college... Plus I'm a lazy bastard. Wait, I know this... A votre sante.

A la votre.
This looks familiar...
Ahh, Rodin. Mmm! He's the fuc- I mean, he's the best. You must go to the Rodin sculpture garden, in the huitieme, it's so beautiful.
Serafine...
I'll be right back. Stay put.
Fixing your makeup with a phone, huh? Who the fuck are you calling?
Professor Roussel. There's something wrong with you. I know it.
Professor Roussel. There's something wrong with you. I know it.
Roussel? You mean Claude? You're calling Dr. Demento so he can come paint my face again? Fuck that.
Hello?
Are you okay?
Are you okay?
No, I don't think so... I was having a nightmare. Wait a second...
No, I don't think so... I was having a nightmare. Wait a second...
Where did you go last night? What did you do?
Where did you go last night? What did you do?
I don't... I... I can't remember...
I don't... I... I can't remember...
Listen, I'm coming over. Don't go anywhere. Stay right there.
I'm not alright. We both know that. The only reason I'm here now is to warn you. You're still in danger. Gaston told me that Claude has got the curse too. He's a werewolf.
I know. He told me.
I know. He told me.
What?! He told you? When?
You two faced bastard. I knew you were full of shit.
Andy! No!
Because, Andy. It's a cure.
A cure?
Andy... I should never have let you go underground. I'm sorry...
I had to be a damn Hemingway hero. Well I'll tell ya, the old man and the sea didn't go through half this shit.
What makes you so sure this will work?
I told you. He already tried to contact me once. If you saw his face... He was desperate to tell me something. I owe him this.
I told you. He already tried to contact me once. If you saw his face... He was desperate to tell me something. I owe him this.
I don't know...
I don't know...
Listen, either he wastes away as a pathetic vegetable or he can give what's left of his life to save hundreds of potential victims. He's a McDermott. I know what his choice would be.

I suppose you're right. But I still don't like it.
They're coming!
Shit. What have I done? Stall them! I'll meet you out back.
I saw him. Just before those bastards zapped him back. The ADM is in the wine cellar, in a bottle of Chateau Margaux.
I didn't know he had a wine cellar.
I didn't know he had a wine cellar.
Guess that's why he hid it there. Let's go.
Are you crazy!?
Before Hemingway, there was Starsky and Hutch.
What the fuck!? You too!?
I... I didn't think you would... I'm sorry... I believed that son-of-a- bitch...
I hope they fucking fry us all.
Yeah. French fries...
Holy mother of God...
Fuck me...
Andy?... What? What is it? Andy... are you okay?
It was you... That night in the tunnels. You. You did this to me.
It was you... That night in the tunnels. You. You did this to me.
No I.... Andy, you can't be sure.
No I.... Andy, you can't be sure.
That's the scar where I stabbed you! Oh God... You deliberately took me down there so you could... God, I can't believe it!
You made me go there. I tried to stop you! You wouldn't listen!
What was I? Your idea of a fuckin' hors d'oeuvre? Huh?
What was I? Your idea of a fuckin' hors d'oeuvre? Huh?
Shut up! You fucking shut up! What do you want? Huh? What the hell do you want?
Here! Come on! Do it! Go ahead.
What...?
What...?
You know what. Kill me. Cut out my fucking heart. Go on! Do it!
We don't both have to die.
I couldn't do it. Not to you.
We can't stop him. Not now. Handcuffed, with no kind of weapons. Please Andy...
No. We have to try. We'll figure something out. And if midnight comes before we can get to him, well, then we go together. Deal? Shake a paw?
I know where he'll go.
Where?
Where?
Somewhere where there are no police, and plenty to eat.
Didn't even have to ask.
All your weapons, on the floor! Now!
No wonder he let her go.
Really.
God. I can't believe it.
What?
What?
It's making me hungry.
What does it say?
"Stop! Beyond this passage lie the catacombs of Paris: the exclusive domain of the dead."
Whoa...
After the revolution, the Paris cemeteries overflowed. They dug up all the old bodies and brought them here. Seven million people. Mostly very poor.

Pretty stylish digs for a bunch of paupers.
Pretty stylish digs for a bunch of paupers.
Well, they are French.
Well, they are French.
Right.
These tunnels must loop around and connect.
Let's go from both ends. We'll cut him off.
Okay. Be careful.
You too.
Oh God. Shit...
Andy...
Hey! You shouldn't be down there!
FOR GOD'S SAKES, LET ME OUT!!
GET ME THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!!
"Fuck"? You think I don't know this word "fuck"? Is that how you talk to policemen in America?
Okay, what the hell are you up to?
It bit me! My leg! Jesus, it's down there, shoot it! Shoot it for Christ's sakes!
There's something down there! A bear or something! A god damn monster! Beau coup teeth! Huge, Grande, with yellow eyes, all this hair, it killed Serafine! My God...
You on drugs? Huh?
You on drugs? Huh?
No... I...
Pull over! Now!
Shit!
It's you. You should be dead in that wreck with Bazin and Racine!
Shhh! Be quiet, man! We're not alone -
Shhh! Be quiet, man! We're not alone -
Shut up! Save your stories. The only thing I want to hear is you begging for your life. I want to see you suffer, like they did. Haha! You're scared now, eh? Come on. Where's the scary monster now huh? Ha ha... We'll see who -
In Paris we have an expression for people like you: Enculé d'Americain.
Yeah? In New York we got an expression too. Goes like this...
Where's the ADM? Where did your uncle put it?
Man, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
Man, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
Bullshit! Your uncle told you!
Bullshit! Your uncle told you!
My uncle's in a coma you moron!
My uncle's in a coma you moron!
Before the coma!
Before the coma!
He didn't tell me anything. All he said was Saint Severin...
Saint Severin? The church? So you know all about the ADM! Where is it! Tell me! Tell me or else!
Or else what? You'll kill me?
Or else what? You'll kill me?
No. But I'll kill your fucking girlfriend!
No. But I'll kill your fucking girlfriend!
You'll never get the chance.
Don't be an idiot! I'm not the only one. If I die, Serafine dies!
Bullshit! You're bluffing!
Bullshit! You're bluffing!
What, you think Claude hangs out underground cause he likes to dance?
Claude...?
And you call me a moron...
The ADM. Let's go.
Yeah, okay. Just gimme a minute to freshen up.
So, if you and the nutty professor are both werewolves, what do you want with drugs? You like seeing lots of pretty colors when you're tearing people's throats out?
If you know about the church, why ask such stupid questions?
What's the problem?
Hey, I'm new here, what do you want?
Do you think I'm an idiot?
Sure. Don't you?
Another step and he's dead!
Go ahead Serafine. Blow him away.
You bastard! God! I should've known. You wanted the cure all for yourself!
Cure!? Ha-ha-ha!
Ha. Some wonder drug...
Why isn't it doing anything!?
Nothing's happening!
Looks like he lied to you too.
You recognize her?
What?!
We know you were with her.
Oh shit... No...
Oh shit... No...
That's not all... Marcel - Officer Boulard was following you.
That's not all... Marcel - Officer Boulard was following you.
Oh no... no....
He was a good man. Now his wife is a widow.
This is... it's like a sick joke, I -
Merde... Wait here. When I return you tell me about last night, huh?
But... I don't remember anything, I swear...
But... I don't remember anything, I swear...
I leave these open. Maybe something comes back to you.
I always wanted to do that. I saw it in a movie.
What about me?
What about me?
My men think you died and floated away in the Seine. If I wanted to, I could let them believe that. But that would be illegal...
I'm sorry my friend, I'm not signing books right now. There's been a tragedy.
I know. I'm Andy McDermott. Terrence's nephew.
It's horrible. Terrence was one of the most brilliant men I've known.
Yeah, well, why did he hang out here? The cops said it's dangerous -
Yeah, well, why did he hang out here? The cops said it's dangerous -
The cops. It's their backward laws that force all this underground in the first place, endangering people whose only crime is pushing the limits of perception, exploring new states of psychic awareness.
Psychic awareness. Right.
You think it's silly. But do you realize that young man is actually in a deep sleep?
You think it's silly. But do you realize that young man is actually in a deep sleep?
What?
What?
He's on a new drug called ZBH, or "Daydream". It allows the user to be fully alert and mobile while he's dreaming. He is literally conscious and unconscious at the same time.

Yeah well, that's like really groovy and everything, but who hacked my uncle's legs off?
Andy...
Yeah?
Yeah?
Terrence and I came down here to do serious work. For centuries these tunnels have been home to subcultures mainstream society would not tolerate.
You didn't know? But then why did you... well, don't worry. It's relatively mild.
Yeah, well if I claw my face off, just pack it in ice, okay? Jesus... the cops were probably right. My uncle was messed up with a bunch of fry brains and they went berserk on him.
Not you too -
My God! Serafine's right. It's time to go. We'll talk soon.
You're exactly right, Andy. I enlisted both Serafine and your uncle to obtain ADM. And now I'm counting on your assistance too.
Why the fuck would I do that?
"Simon ate of the heart of the beast and his soul was cleansed." These pictures are not just myth, Andy. The scholars of the day used them to record facts and enlighten the public. This is the medieval version of a newspaper.
Yeah, well what if it's the Weekly World News...
I don't believe we've been introduced.
What?... Oh, right, you can see these guys too. Jesus...
Great. Later on we'll have to get together for cocktails. Right now I kinda have to hurry before I grow a lot of hair and eat people. Say this heart thing works. What's it got to do with ADM?
It's chemistry, Andy. Nothing more. Mutated antigens concentrated in the heart of the infector unlock a vaccine- like chain reaction in the infectee. There were not many bio-chemists working in the twelfth century, but with today's technology it's possible to synthesize any chemical imaginable. When I discovered this ancient cure I knew who to go to.

Uncle Terrence.
Uncle Terrence.
Yes. I was able to decode the old texts and give Terrence the specifications. It took a lot of trial and error, but finally he got it: Adenine Di-Methyloxide. ADM. I call it ADAM. But just before he was attacked, he hid it...

Because Gaston was after it.
Because Gaston was after it.
Yes, that sociopath. He's given himself over to the evil of lycanthropy. To him, ADAM is just a threat to the terror he holds over others. To us, it's salvation.
Eight o'clock. Shit. You'd think my uncle would have left a clue, a note, something...
That's what Serafine is searching for. Without much luck, I'm afraid. If only we could speak with him. But alas, he's off in another realm, close to death.
It killed him... You coulda just used Draino. It's cheaper.
I told him it wasn't ready...
All my life I've worked to unlock the power of the unconscious mind. Well this is it. This is power!
You sure it's not just 'coz you jerk off too much?
Uncle Terrence?
Andy? Andy is that you?
Andy? Andy is that you?
Yeah. Look, uncle Terrence -
Andy, I have to tell you about the dream I had - or that I'm still having - it feels like a systemic, physio- tropic reaction to some drug, maybe a triptamine or phenethylamine derivative. But it is hyper-real. I'd swear my legs had been cut off or... wait a second... I'm getting a strange meta-physical buzz. Shit. I'm, uh, dead, aren't I?
Sort of...
Undead. Right. Sort of an ectocosmic manifestation. What a pisser. Tell you one thing though, Timothy Leary will be jealous as hell.
Great, but listen, I need to know where you hid the ADM?
Great, but listen, I need to know where you hid the ADM?
The ADM! Be careful, Andy. It's very powerful. How do you know about it?
The ADM! Be careful, Andy. It's very powerful. How do you know about it?
I went to St. Severin church. Now look -
Oh shit! No! Andy, don't let them take me back there!
The ADM! Quickly! Where is it?!
Where is it! Please!
AHHH!! The wine cellar!! In a bottle of Chateau Margaux. A metal cylinder... Don't... Don't - AAAAH!
Uncle Terrence, you're...
Yeah, I finally "checked out", thank God. But there's a bit of unfinished business.
Yeah, I finally "checked out", thank God. But there's a bit of unfinished business.
Claude.
Claude.
I never thought I'd ask this of anyone, Andy, but do me a favor and kill the evil son-of-a-bitch, will you?
Andrew Mc-dair-mo?
That's McDermott, but yeah.
He's in charge but, uh, between you and me, my English is better. This way... So you're from New York eh? I love those Hill Street Blues...
Right. Listen, my uncle, it's not serious is it? Did he eat some bad snails? Slip on the bidet? What?
Jesus...
How well did, er, do you know him?
How well did, er, do you know him?
Not too well. He taught at the Sorbonne, right? Dad always calls him his "hippie brother". Did some work with Timothy Leary I think, and - Is he... is he going to die?
Not too well. He taught at the Sorbonne, right? Dad always calls him his "hippie brother". Did some work with Timothy Leary I think, and - Is he... is he going to die?
No. The doctors say the machines should keep him going a long time. But basically he is, how you say, a legume.
No. The doctors say the machines should keep him going a long time. But basically he is, how you say, a legume.
Legume? You mean, a vegetable?
Legume? You mean, a vegetable?
Vegetable, right. My mistake. It seems he was attacked by a maniac, maybe two or three maniacs, just after midnight. yesterday. They fled into the tunnels beneath Paris, that's all we know...

What do you mean, maniacs?
What do you mean, maniacs?
Well, here's what I think happened. A chemistry professor goes to a bad part of town late at night. Why? Perhaps he's making a few francs on the side. The psychedelic drug market is big these days. He gets mixed up with a bad crowd and, like they say, if you lie with dogs, you get fleas.

Yeah, well, these fleas must have teeth like fuckin' chain saws.
Maybe we should go now. You must be very tired. We'll call if any new -
I can't believe this. Why don't you go down in the tunnels and find the goddamn... animals that attacked my uncle?
I can't believe this. Why don't you go down in the tunnels and find the goddamn... animals that attacked my uncle?
Andy, it's not so easy. There are hundreds of kilometers of tunnels under Paris. It's a whole other city, crawling with drug addicts, lunatics, skinheads... It's no man's land.
Yeah. I guess so. Did he say anything? Before the coma?
Just the name of this hospital, St. Severin. He repeated it a few times then he lost consciousness.
Just the name of this hospital, St. Severin. He repeated it a few times then he lost consciousness.
Why would he pick this one?
Why would he pick this one?
I don't know. There were others much closer. He was religious?

Not that I know.
Not that I know.
Well, when you're about to pop off, what have you got to lose? Thanks for your help.
I'm afraid she's not so lucky. She's undead. And so am I.
Aaaaa!!! Get the fuck away from me!
Aaaaa!!! Get the fuck away from me!
What are you so damn angry about? Did somebody turn into a wild beast and rip your intestines out? Huh?
Fuck you! If I'm gonna kill myself I'll do it when I'm good and ready! You can go to hell!
No we can't. That's the problem. God knows it would beat hanging around with you!
Alright. Let me write a letter.
Good man. Now can I have my arms back?
What the hell, lots of my heroes killed themselves. Hemingway, Van Gogh... um... Herve Villachaise...
But this is class kid, all the way. What a way to go.
Shit. I feel sick.
Don't worry. In a few seconds you won't feel a thing.
Don't worry. In a few seconds you won't feel a thing.
Puking on yourself in midair is not a good death.
Yeah, well I don't know much about chemistry, but even if this stuff works, you better find it by midnight. Otherwise it's -
Yeah, I know. Back to the Eiffel Tower. And what about you?
Okay. So he's weird. Maybe on drugs. Still, that's not -
I'm telling you. It's not drugs. It's something more. Someth -
I'm telling you. It's not drugs. It's something more. Someth -
Don't give me your black magic bullshit! Seven mutilations in forty eight hours and all you find is a scrawny American boy? Do you have a motive? Do you have a weapon? Or do you want me to believe he did it with his own two hands?
Don't give me your black magic bullshit! Seven mutilations in forty eight hours and all you find is a scrawny American boy? Do you have a motive? Do you have a weapon? Or do you want me to believe he did it with his own two hands?
I told you. These murders are not normal.
Enough. Cut him loose.
I can't! At midnight tonight, he will kill again. It's crazy!
I can't! At midnight tonight, he will kill again. It's crazy!
Are you crazy? We have nothing. Let him go, then watch him. If you're right, you can pick him up at midnight. Or maybe he'll lead you to the others. Just let him go.
Andy, stop! I think he can help you -
Allo?
Andy!
Serafine? Is that you? What's going on?
Serafine? Is that you? What's going on?
Claude, it's Andy, he's acting really weird, I think something happened last night...
Claude, it's Andy, he's acting really weird, I think something happened last night...
God, well don't let him go! Catch him!
No, it's no cure. It's something much more interesting.
You fucking liar!
You fucking liar!
Oh, did I hurt the little girl's feelings? Well excusez moi... I confess my desire for ADM is quite "intense". So I deceived you and our poor friend Terry - a competent technician, but let's face it, a bit naive. "The great cure for lycanthropy!" Hmph. He didn't have the vision to grasp the potential of ADAM, until it was too late. And even
What've you got?
Just a crazy call from a girl, probably fucked up on drugs. I wouldn't bother you but you said call with anything unusual.

What did she say?
What did she say?
Something about a monster, underground, in the catacombs under Place Denfert.

Now!
Now!
Yes sir.
Merde.
He says -
Here.
Your uncle was carrying this. The keys to his apartment are in there. I talked to his assistant, Madame Flocquet. You'll be staying there a while?
Well?
Okay. So maybe you were right.
Okay. So maybe you were right.
Hmmph. At least now there's one person around here who doesn't think I'm crazy.
Twelve thirty-six a.m. here. Twelve forty a.m. here. There's two of them. At least.
Merde.
Two more nights in this lunar cycle.
Double merde.
You better follow that McDermott kid. He's going to wind up like his uncle if he's not careful.
Right. Little twerp thinks he's Colombo.
Saint Severin...
You never heard the story of Saint Severin driving the werewolves from Paris?

I was showing Sonya something . . .
I was showing Sonya something . . .
What were you showing her?
What were you showing her?
How to read.
How to read.
I thought you were told not to tutor your servants anymore.
I thought you were told not to tutor your servants anymore.
I know, but I had to because . . .
Oh, Grandmama, why do you have to go back to Paris?
It's where I've made my home but I do have something for you . . .
"Together in Paris"! Oh, when can we be "together in Paris?!
When you're older . . .
Hurry, Grandmama!
Get on! Anastasia, get on!
Are you running away?
No. I'm running <u>to</u>.
Where is your home, Anya?
I'm not sure but look. . .
I have to go now, before it gets light.
But what if we can't ever find where we came from?!
But what if we can't ever find where we came from?!
Then you'll have to make your own home. Lots of people do.
Anya! What if <u>we</u> can't find anyone who loves us?!
Then come find me.
Who did you hear it from?
I heard it from everyone who said I didn't hear it from them! Do you know Dmitri?
Providing travel papers is illeagal! I know Dmitri well - perhaps I can help you. Providded you have enough money to pay for this service. . .
Well, I don't have any money . . .
Well, I don't have any money . . .
Good day!
I was just wondering since we already have the dress. . .
Look, I came here to get papers to travel to Paris and. . .
Noooo....
She's quite right, Dmitri, a man of my stature should not have to
Is everyone all right?
I'm fine.
We have to prepare you for an audience with Sophie.
Who's Sophie?
Who's Sophie?
Ah ... the Lady Sophie... The ravishing first cousin, once removed, from the Empress. We must convince Sophie that you are the Princess before we'll be granted a meeting with the Empress ... your grandmother, I mean.
We're just going to refresh your memory...
I don't have a memory and I'm not a Princess! Even if I were - no one's ever going to believe it. I'm not exactly...
Did I tell you that?
You must have.
No! I look ridiculous!
Come out! I can do alterations.
Come out! I can do alterations.
You'll laugh.
You'll laugh.
I shant!
I shant!
Not you. Him.
Oh, Meetoo! You look miserable! Oh, Vlad - look at him!
Yes, your highness.
Yes, your highness.
Poor Meetoo!
Poor Meetoo!
Yes, your highness.
Yes, your highness.
Cut it out, Vlad! I'm not angry with you anymore - I know how much you needed the money.
Fortunately, I am to be married. With your highness, permission.
Vlad, stop acting this way! You're my friend!
Vlad, stop acting this way! You're my friend!
No. From now on I am your loyal subject ... your highness. By your leave?
Ouch! That really hurt!
I'm sorry. . . I'm. . .
I'm sorry. . . I'm. . .
That's quite a hard head you've got there, boy.
AND A SONG SOMEONE SINGS ONCE UPON A DECEMBER.
Who are you?!
People say Anastasia was the only member of the Royal Family to escape alive. That makes her an orphan too
What happened to your parents?
What happened to your parents?
I don't know - I don't remember anything that happened before the revolution. . .
I don't know - I don't remember anything that happened before the revolution. . .
You know, it's strange - Anastasia's grandmother, the Dowager Empress Tatiana has been looking for Anastasia since the revolution. Why do you think she wouldn't go to her own grandmother?
You know, it's strange - Anastasia's grandmother, the Dowager Empress Tatiana has been looking for Anastasia since the revolution. Why do you think she wouldn't go to her own grandmother?
I don't know. I don't see what this has to do with me.
I don't know. I don't see what this has to do with me.
Perhaps it's because she has amnesia too - can't remember. . .
Why do you want to go to Paris?
I have my reasons.
I have my reasons.
Anastasia's grandmother is in Paris. We're going to bring Anastasia to her - in Paris.
You never thought of the possibility?
Look - there isn't an orphan in the world who doesn't dream she's a princess but, come on. . . Look at me!
Do you always punch people first thing in the morning?
Sorry - it's a reflex. Living in an orphanage if someone bothers you - you automatically come up swinging.
Sorry - it's a reflex. Living in an orphanage if someone bothers you - you automatically come up swinging.
I wasn't bothering you. I was trying to wake you up!
By pulling my hair?!
I was all out of dynamite!
I'm going to stretch my legs
That's a good idea - a great idea - stretch your legs ... stretch then that way.
Come on up!
Why?
Just what do you think you're doing?!
Trying... to... breathe...
Forged papers! Now, what?!
Now just get off the train.
Now just get off the train.
HUH?!
Come on!
No!
You must enjoy causing me pain!
You shouldn't have pushed us!
You never said anything to me about having to prove I'm a Princess!
You are the Princess.
Every Russian family has one..
Natasha! Natasha Feastavich!- but we called her Nashie Fooshie!
...fish fork, salad fork, meat fork and. . . [THIS SECTION ALSO NOT LEDGABLE]
It's the best fork of all
It's the best fork of all
The dessert fork!
What a beautiful ship!
It used to be a private yacht before the government took it over.
You said you wouldn't laugh!
It's not you - it's the dress!
It's so beautiful ... and sad.
Sad?
Sad?
Lost. it feels lost. This was hers?
Lost. it feels lost. This was hers?
Yeah ... well, yours. You still don't believe that you're the Princess, do you?
Yeah ... well, yours. You still don't believe that you're the Princess, do you?
I know I must have had something to do with the palace - I've had little flashes of things - but being the Princess? It doesn't matter as long as I find my home.
I know I must have had something to do with the palace - I've had little flashes of things - but being the Princess? It doesn't matter as long as I find my home.
Well, the only thing you've got when you've got a home is a fear of losing it! You're lucky you don't remember the revolution -- I never had much, but what I did have -- I lost.
Well, the only thing you've got when you've got a home is a fear of losing it! You're lucky you don't remember the revolution -- I never had much, but what I did have -- I lost.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Hey! It doesn't matter! You gotta make your own way in the world! Don't be sorry for me! I'm going to get what I want don't you worry!
Oh! I'm sorry...
It's okay. Didn't hurt..
Nervous?
Yes - If I can't convince Sophie, I'll never be able to see Tatiana....
Yes - If I can't convince Sophie, I'll never be able to see Tatiana....
You'll convince her. You have the qualities of a princess you're poised and strong... and beautiful ... even if you forget a couple dates of family names - she'll know.
I'm so scared...
Don't be
Anya, wait!
Tell me it isn't true?! Tell me you didn't do this for the money!
Tell me it isn't true?! Tell me you didn't do this for the money!
No! Well, yes, but
No! Well, yes, but
No! I thought you believed in me! It was all a lie!
I'm glad you found what you were looking for.
I'm glad you did too.
Dmitri?
Anya... where are we?
Don't let me go!
I'll never let go!
Who are you, child?
I don't know! I don't want to hurt you...
Do you remember this?
I remember something lost ... I'm so confused! Oh, please, just tell me if you recognize me! Do you think I could have... belonged to you ...
PAR AWAY, LONG AGO GLOWING DEEP AS AN EMBER
THINGS MY HEAR USED TO KNOW THINGS IT YEARS TO REMEMBER
... and that Christmas dinner, when Cook made that awful plum pudding and we hid it in our pockets so we wouldn't hurt her feelings! I do remember so much now, Grandmama, - but not everything.
Don't worry about that now, child, it will all come back to you now that you're home...
Anastasia! It was just a bat! It's gone, dear...
No, it wasn't a bat! I saw this horrible man - I remember him, I think...
No, it wasn't a bat! I saw this horrible man - I remember him, I think...
No, no child... shush... it's all right ...
Don't you, child?
Oh, yes, Grandmama - I wait until I hear...
Oh, yes, Grandmama - I wait until I hear...
No, not about the ceremony, Anastasia - do you understand the choice you must make.
Dmitri didn't want the money?
No, he just wanted to know you were happy.
Why does everyone have to act that way?
You'll have to become used to it, child, if you accept the crown...
You'll have to become used to it, child, if you accept the crown...
"If" I accept?! Of course I'm going to accept! it's what I always wanted!
"If" I accept?! Of course I'm going to accept! it's what I always wanted!
Is it? Is this what you want?
I wanted to come home, Grandmama - and I did. I came back to my home with you.
You can't go back to find your home. Your home is in your heart, in the future that you make for yourself.
You can't go back to find your home. Your home is in your heart, in the future that you make for yourself.
And this is my future. This is who I am!
And this is my future. This is who I am!
This is who you were. Exactly who you are is up to you.
This is who you were. Exactly who you are is up to you.
I don't know who I am! I still don't know!
I don't know who I am! I still don't know!
Yes, you do. You do.
I've spent my whole life waiting to find you ...
And we have found each other nothing will ever change that! I am your family, dear child, but I may not be your home.
What?
Oh my God! Don't do that ... feel my heart. Go ahead. I'm dying here ...
Oh my God! Don't do that ... feel my heart. Go ahead. I'm dying here ...
And what do you want, my little rat-with-wings?
I gave you that tongue and I can rip it out!
No, I really like my tongue... we're very attached. Oyyyy... Okay, now... promise you won't get angry.
No, I really like my tongue... we're very attached. Oyyyy... Okay, now... promise you won't get angry.
Why would I ever be angry with you, little friend?
So, I'm cruisin' the rafters and... what can I say, I struck out. I thought chicks would like the fact that I can talk, you know but, I mean, the way things are going I couldn't get invited to a plague. Someone's gotta clean that up...
Get to the point sometime tonight.. I'm late for a wenching.
Get to the point sometime tonight.. I'm late for a wenching.
Okay... you're not gonna like this but, well, it looks like Anastasia is ... still alive.
Trust me, it's her!
How do you know?
How do you know?
Rodent's intuition, how do I know? She looks exactly like her. Except she's taller, which is natural ... Of course my second cousin Treplev - he never grew. Looks like a little pepper shaker. He was so cute ...
Hey, she's just a kid. And she's going to Paris outta sight, outta mind, outta Russia.
I cursed then all!
I cursed then all!
My Aunt Bella, sweet woman not the brightest bat in the world - she used to hang right side up, anyway she always said "Curses were made to be broken". Course, she said it in those irritating little bat squeaks, so it wasn't quite so profound...
Do you have any idea what would happen if that broke?!
You'd lose your security deposit?
You'd lose your security deposit?
Evil, powerful beings - I have their power only if I contain them, control them. If they should all be released at once... well ...
Yesss... our power is much stronger when were near. We must get close to her.
Oy... not a road trip. I get wagon sick, you know that.
I'm getting a chest cold..
Bartok... a question.
Bartok... a question.
I'm getting pneumonia. I have a fever. Feel my forehead...
I'm getting pneumonia. I have a fever. Feel my forehead...
What do you think is the most humiliating way to die?
Boy, don't you hate it when that happens?
She leads a charmed life, that little one ... Someone is always there to save her. In the palace as a child, on the train and now ... it's him.
Bartok ... have you ever been to Paris?
Me? No. Rich food - it kills me. Ever try and fly after one of those heavy sauces?
PARSE HOLDS THE KEY TO MY HEART FRENCH- BAT- CHICKS HANG OUT AT MONTMARTRE WE'LL EAT SOME IN-SECTS THEN GO BACK AND HAVE --
Shut up!
It's no use, Dmitri - we'll never find the right girl!
We will. We <u>have</u> to. Come on, Vlad - she's out there.
What was that?
That was your dinner! I do hope there is no cabbage in Paris!
It's her.
He's her?
He's her?
Look!
She doesn't want to do anything "dishonest". . .
Ew. . . the honest type.
Hurry up with those papers.
Would you have leaned over Rembrant's shoulder and told him to paint faster?
Wake up, young lady, that's our train.
"Wake up, your highness" - we should start getting used to saying it.
"Wake up, your highness" - we should start getting used to saying it.
What a world - a man who was in my position in society is calling a peasant 'Your Highness".
You're a princess...
Royalty do not help people with their luggage.
Well, she certainly has a mind of her own.
Yes. And I hate that in a woman.
What do we do now?
Pray he's color-blind...
See? The Princess is under there ...
Ah! Let us begin!
How is our current financial status?
If I used the word "bleak" I would be optimistic.
The "Odessa Dunk"?
It worked in Odessa...
We did it! We did it, my boy! We're going to see Tatiana at the ballet tonight and we're going to be rich! Rich!
But it's not the money, Vlad.
But it's not the money, Vlad.
Are you feeling all right?
Life is funny, isn't it. You find the right girl ... and then you lose her.
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
Dmitri ... You must understand that once you take her to Tatiana... well, it's over... nothing can happen between you. She's a princess and you're a commoner.
But this invitation came from the Empress herself! It's the social event of the decade! You can't turn it down!
Watch me.
So where will you go?
She found her home. Maybe it's time I found one too!
So. You don't want to go to the coronation, eh?
Rasputin!
Rasputin!
I know, I know ... you thought I was dead. That's how the history books will remember me - not as the ruler of all of Russia, which I SHOULD HAVE BEEN - but as the guy who was never dead when you expected him to be.
What do you want?!
The same thing I wanted ten years ago - all the Romonovs dead I got the others, now I have to finish up with that nuisance, Anastasia...
The same thing I wanted ten years ago - all the Romonovs dead I got the others, now I have to finish up with that nuisance, Anastasia...
You're insane! You didn't kill the Romonovs - it was the...
You're insane! You didn't kill the Romonovs - it was the...
STOP IT! I DID SO KILL THEM! And I'm going to kill Anastasia.
I'll show you!
Run, Anya - go...
I need to speak with the Dowager Empress ...
How much pain will you inflict on an old woman for money?!
How much pain will you inflict on an old woman for money?!
Please, if you'd just listen...
Please, if you'd just listen...
Remove him at once.
I'm not Ulo and I won't slow down. But you will listen to me!
You! How dare you?! Stop this car immediately!
Anastasia's music box... She had this all these years... You could have found it...
What I <U>found</U>your was your granddaughter!
I sent for you because I owe you a debt of gratitude larger than I can ever repay
No. Empress, you --
No. Empress, you --
I want you to have the reward money - you've earned it.
Empress, no! I will not take the money! I just came to tell you I was sorry...
Young man, I...
You are the boy ...
I should go
I should go
That last night in the palace... one boy showed us kindness and courage. You were the boy who saved our lives, weren't you? Please, is there nothing I can do to repay you?
That last night in the palace... one boy showed us kindness and courage. You were the boy who saved our lives, weren't you? Please, is there nothing I can do to repay you?

She does.

After all I've done for your family - YOU TRIED TO KILL MEEEEEE ! ! !
May I present her Royal Highness Princess Anastasia!
Oh good! We haven't seen an Anastasia in several days!
Are you impressed with our Anastasia?
Oh, heavens - I must say, yes.
Oh, heavens - I must say, yes.
Then, you'll take her to see Tatiana?
Then, you'll take her to see Tatiana?
Oh, heavens I must say... no, no actually, I can't - Tatiana has refused to see any more girls.
Oh, heavens I must say... no, no actually, I can't - Tatiana has refused to see any more girls.
Perhaps you could convince her?
Perhaps you could convince her?
Oh, heavens, no... but ... She is going to be at the Ballet Russe tonight! That's the Russian Ballet - Russe for Russian, oh those crazy French... they only go to see which dancers will defect.

Well, you only give me books with the word "death" in the title.
It's an important issue.
Alvy, you are totally incapable of enjoying life.
You're like New York. You're an island.
Okay, if that's all that we've been through together means to you, I guess it's better if we just said goodbye, once and for all! You know, it's funny, after all the serious talks and passionate moments that it ends here... in a health food restaurant on Sunset Boulevard. Goodbye, Sunny.
Excuse... excuse me, when do I go on?

Well, I'm getting tired of it. I need your attention.
It-but it-it... doesn't make any sense. He drove past the book depository and the police said conclusively that it was an exit wound. So-how is it possible for Oswald to have fired from two angles at once? It doesn't make sense.

Oh, my God! She's right! Why did I turn off Allison Portchnik? She was-she was beautiful. She was willing. She was real... intelligent. Is it the old Groucho Marx joke? That-that I-I just don't wanna belong to any club that would have someone like me for a member?

Hey, you... everybody in line at the New Yorker has to know our rate of intercourse?
Stop it, Alvy!

Oh!

It's that they don't throw their garbage away. They make it into television shows.

Well... H-h huh... Oh, good... Yes, I'll tell him.

Alvy, what is so fascinating about a group of pituitary cases trying to stuff the ball through a hoop?
What's fascinating is that it's physical. You know, it's one thing about intellectuals, they prove that you can be absolutely brilliant and have no idea what's going on. But on the other hand... the body doesn't lie, as-as we now know.

Skye! I'm so glad you're able to make it...it's our sixth, actually. You read the book again? Well, no, the ending to chapter six...it's just that it's not filmic. We tried it in an earlier draft, but, it just wasn't filmic... Well, sure, we can absolutely look at that again. If you're coming from Laurel, you want to take Sunset west, we're just past

Oh don't. Everyone says that.
Please, Ryan.
No, he's absolutely right. You're absolutely right, Ryan. Dog talk must be banned. Canine conversations are completely discouraged... it's really good of you to join us. Can I get you a drink?
Something soft.
Right away. Are you sure you wouldn't like something soft, Ryan?
Your Eames table is incredible. And the B&B. I just put that in a client's home, actually, but in red.
You're an interior decorator, right?

Sally did all this herself?

In fits and starts -- and then, later, of course, she had to accommodate me. So things shifted a little bit then, became more eclectic. And it keeps changing.

And your phone calls are nasty and abusive. And I've come this close to suing you for harassment. And you're only here because we're supposed to be sucking up to you.

Well, that's what Ryan thought. I was more generous, actually.
Well, that's what Ryan thought. I was more generous, actually.
Oh shit. I'm sorry. I'm a total fucking maniac. Delete all that, okay? I spoke for myself, this needn't rub off on my wife. Oh shit. I get pissy sometimes. Much worse than Otis. Otis doesn't bite. It's just, I really love my dog and he doesn't really bark a lot. We live in a canyon. We hear dogs barking at night, too. And
Easy tiger.
Alright. Please don't tell Ryan I'm drinking.

You know what Sally Therrian was saying about your spine and your brain? She didn't pull that out of thin air. It causes brain damage. You'd better drink a lot of water.

All the ugly phone calls? We're not the only people with a tape recorder, Ryan. They've gone to the canyon, we should go towards the PCH.

I'm in the same room with Sally Nash. Oh my God. You're my icon. I've been watching your films since I was a little girl. Like, four years ago I followed you all around the Beverly Center - at least half a day, working up the courage to introduce myself.
And I'm overwhelmed. And I want to do it justice. And I hope we can spend time together. And I'm gushing. It's my worst quality.
Not at all.

Panes is not on my team anymore. I'll have Panes if I like.
Yes.
Well, so glad you decided to come.
Thank you. This was so unnecessary. I hope you've noticed that Otis isn't barking as much. We keep him in at night.
At 4:30 today he barked for a solid fifteen minutes. I have it on tape.

It's just very distracting when you're trying to work.
Well the neighborhood is full of dogs, and it's not always Otis.
Well today it was Otis. And you should keep him away from our yard. Because Sheila will defend herself.

Oh. Well, yes. It's extraordinary. You think you could sign it for us?
Oh. Well, yes. It's extraordinary. You think you could sign it for us?
Absolutely. You always wonder where your books end up. Why don't we use it?
Oh my God, sorry. I'm interrupting.
I'll be right out.
I don't think I ever spent half a day in the Beverly Center.
Whatever, do you remember? I've seen all your movies. When I was in rehab, the second time, they wouldn't even let us see your drug addict movie. They said you were too real. I worship you. And I couldn't be more flattered, because I know the part I'm playing in Joe's movie is based on you as a young woman.
Happy anniversary. Thank you for making me a part of it.
What are they?
You don't need to do that.
I don't mind...
I don't mind...
Relax. You've done enough.
Enough about me.

Don't try and change the subject. Oh God, it feels great! He's just a little narcissistic, irresponsible and unreliable.

Sorry Azteca. Here you go, fellas! Fresh dirt! Alley oop! Shouldn't we be wearing gloves? I mean this dirt is very...dirty. Doesn't anyone think of hygiene? Boy am I hungry. I'm so hungry I'm seeing double. It looks like there's <u>two</u> million ants in here. When's lunch? Tomorrow, or the day after?
Z, old pal... SHUT UP!!! It's bad enough there's a food shortage without you complaining about it every day.

No, Z. The squeaky wheel gets <u>thrown</u> <u>away</u>, alright? You're a good ant, Z, even though you are a pain in my rear- segment. I don't wanna see anything happen to you. So quit mouthing off, before you get in trouble.

Who cares, Z. All I know is, we gotta dig. We're not the ones in charge.
Hey, slow it down, big boy. You're making the rest of us look bad...How come I haven't seen you around here before?
I'm new...I was born yesterday.
I'm new...I was born yesterday.
Tell me about it.

Nobody told me digging was so much fun! You pick up the dirt, you move it, you pick it up again, you move it again -- lots of repetitions, you exercise the forceps, and the pincers --

I don't know what came over me, talking back like that. I must be going crazy...
Sorry I got you in trouble. But listen, you can share my rations.

I'll make myself available...Listen, better watch out with the backtalk. I don't know want you to end up like the guy who used to work next to me. I'm afraid he got... <u>downsized</u>.
Wait a minute, that's no soldier -- that's Z!
Z? <u>Our</u> Z? The little guy made it!
You know, you're not just workers -- you can be whatever you want to be! Look at Z! He started as a worker -- then he became a soldier!
That's right! He slaughtered hundreds of termites single-handedly!
Well, because he's more than a worker...he's a...what did he call it, Azteca...
Invisible!
Invisible!
No -- an <u>individual</u>!
Someone who follows his heart!
Right...because every ant's important!
General -- we have to talk sometime!
Very well. Carpenter, is there a convenient time to talk vis-a-vis: relationship?
So, um...how was your day? What did you do?
Well... I declared war!
Well... I declared war!
Oh...and I was afraid we had nothing in common...
He's...he's dead. You don't have to look for him anymore. He was eaten by a praying mantis.
It's a shame he died prematurely...I was hoping to kill him myself.

Well you'll never be able to hurt him where he is now. I miss him already.
Well you'll never be able to hurt him where he is now. I miss him already.
You miss him? <u>Why</u>?
You miss him? <u>Why</u>?
Because...because he's <u>twice</u> the ant that you are. I could <u>never</u> go through with marrying you. I'm -- I'm an <u>individual</u>, and when I get married, it'll be to someone <u>I</u> choose.
What a bunch of losers. Mindless zombies capitulating to an oppressive system --
Wanna dance?
So uh -- how come I haven't seen you around here before?
I work in the palace, I don't get out much.

Why can't I just do whatever I want to do? Why can't I just go wild?! Yahoo!
You watch yours, soldier, or my worker friend will beat you up!
Oh, that's okay, I'll let him off this time. Are you crazy? This guy's built like a pebble! You know they do great prosthetic antennas nowadays --

Wait! When can I see you again?
Let me think. Hmmnn... Never. Bye!
You're the hero of the recent termite campaign, aren't you?
Well, if single-handedly vanquishing the enemy and slaughtering a whole nestful of termites makes someone a hero, yes I am.
And you are...?
I'm Princess Bala.
I'm Princess Bala.
Ah, yes. Well, charmed, I'm sure. So, Princess, have you ever danced with a hero?
Ah, yes. Well, charmed, I'm sure. So, Princess, have you ever danced with a hero?
Yes.
Yes.
Oh...oh well then, one more won't matter.
No, General. I'm dancing with the war hero.
Uh, sorry, General, I...I've always had this animal magnetism, it --
You dance...
Divinely?
Divinely?
No weirdly...You remind me of someone...
He was a worker. I danced with him at a <u>worker's bar</u> just the other day. I'm not shocking you, am I?
No...as a matter of fact...
No...as a matter of fact...
OH MY GOD, IT'S YOU! YOU'RE A WORKER!!! A filthy, stupid, disgusting WORKER!
Gee, uh, could you say it a little louder, I think there are some ants in the next colony who didn't hear you.
I CAN'T DANCE WITH A WORKER!
I CAN'T DANCE WITH A WORKER!

Alright, alright, I'll try to get directions from one of the locals.
Excuse me, I -- Pardon me -- And they call them social insects.
Climb up that tree and get a better view!
I've been kidnapped by the village idiot.
Who's the bigger idiot -- the idiot who gets kidnapped, or the idiot who lets herself get kidnapped by the idiot?
Who's the bigger idiot -- the idiot who gets kidnapped, or the idiot who lets herself get kidnapped by the idiot?
How dare you speak to me like that? I'm the Princess!
Theoretically, yes. But is the monarchical hierarchy applicable without the underlying social structure to support it?
Of course! It defines society! To deny the precept is to say that order is an arbitrary distinction applied by the society itself!

Is that the same standard you used to choose General Formica?
Is that the same standard you used to choose General Formica?
I <u>didn't</u> choose him. What kind of <u>idiot</u> would... ...<u>choose</u> who she wanted to marry?
Now, worker, you shall take me back to the colony, and have your head cut off and stuck on a sharp pole!
Well, that's an appealing offer, but...considering the options... You go back. Me, I'm going to Insectopia.
Well, that's an appealing offer, but...considering the options... You go back. Me, I'm going to Insectopia.

We're going to die!
Come on -- it's gone! What are the chances of that happening again?
Why didn't I listen to my mother ...why'd I have to go looking for trouble? Any ant would have given their left legs to be in my position...what's <u>wrong</u> with me?
Want a list?
Want a list?
Wait, I hear something!
This lake is huge! And so close to the colony! Think of the vacation potential!
Cut me down a soft leaf so I can take a nap.
Cut me down a soft leaf so I can take a nap.
Listen, "Princess", you can't order me around. Out here, you're not the boss anymore -- out here, you're just --
Out here I'm just what?
Hlllllllp!
Hlllllllp!
Stop fooling around in there.
Princess, has it ever occurred to you that they're <u>not going to rescue you</u>?
General Formica won't let me die out here. I'm his fiancee.

So what makes you so special?

Well...I <u>am</u> the oldest.
Face it, Z, we're lost! We must have walked halfway across the world by now! How did I get into this mess...
Come on...tell me there wasn't just a little...something between us that first night at the bar. The night we danced.
Come on...tell me there wasn't just a little...something between us that first night at the bar. The night we danced.
What difference does it make...we're both going to starve to death, or get squished, or set on fire...
We've found it! <u>Insectopia</u>! Look at all this food'
You were right...you were right! Z, it's <u>beautiful</u>!
You were right...you were right! Z, it's <u>beautiful</u>!
Let's dig in!
Z...if we don't make it...I just want you to know....
Yes?
Yes?
<u>This is all your fault</u>!!!
Come on, Z.
Forget it. You go ahead, I give up. I...I don't know what I was thinking. "Insectopia".
So...you never did tell me...what made you come out to the worker bar that night?
Just looking for fun, adventure, trouble, I guess.
Just looking for fun, adventure, trouble, I guess.
Well, "trouble" is my middle name. Actually, my middle name is .985, but I don't tell people. Hey, Bala, I...I actually have something of yours...you left it at the bar that night.
Sorry, it's been through a war, not to mention everything else...
You held onto this all that time?
You held onto this all that time?
Well, I...I know it's a little strange, but...I thought it might come in handy if I...needed a scarf someday. Well, to be honest, I just liked having it.
Why do they have you tied up here?
There's something going on, Z --
Bala, that -- that lake we found -- I think the tunnel's right underneath it! -- Formica's going to <u>flood the</u> <u>colony</u>!!! That's what he meant when said there were too many ants!
Oh no...
Z! what are you doing?
I know it's crazy, but -- I can't just leave. Don't argue with me. If I've learned anything, it's that the problems of two people don't add up to a hill of ants in this world. Or beans. Something like that. Anyway, I've <u>got to warn the others</u>.
I mean, I've got the whole package, right? A great life, a beautiful wife, and a few kids.
A <u>few</u>?
The Club's so <u>stuffy</u>. I want to try someplace different.
There isn't anyplace else -- Except the worker bar.
There isn't anyplace else -- Except the worker bar.
The worker bar! Yes! That's where I want to go!
We shouldn't be doing this -- it isn't proper!
I'm the Princess, aren't I?
I'm the Princess, aren't I?
Of course --
Of course --
And do Princesses do improper things?
And do Princesses do improper things?
Of course not --
Of course not --
Then if I go to the worker bar, it isn't improper. Anyway, don't worry. No one will recognize us in our disguises.
Bala has always been a hopeless romantic, General.
It's just that -- well, I'm honored that you selected me, and everything, I just thought the marriage might go a little more smoothly if -- we had a conversation?
I felt the same way before I got married. Confused. Scared.
You did?
You did?
Yes -- but I did my duty and sorted out all those messy feelings. The wonderful thing about ant life is that everything is arranged. Even marriage. You're lucky -- General Formica is a paragon of anthood.
Yes -- but I did my duty and sorted out all those messy feelings. The wonderful thing about ant life is that everything is arranged. Even marriage. You're lucky -- General Formica is a paragon of anthood.
Yes...he's wonderful...
Who is that idiot?
Darling, you must encourage the troops -- wave!
Bala!
Mom!
You new, kid?
I just joined up. But I'm quitting! I got a trial membership!
I just joined up. But I'm quitting! I got a trial membership!
Trial membership? Kid, when you join this ant's army, you're in for the full hitch.
You just stick by old Barbatus. He'll watch out for you. Whatsamatter, kid? Leave a girl behind?
Yeah. Well -- no. She's kind of playing hard to get. As a matter of fact, she's playing completely unattainable. So, what's on the schedule? A brisk walk? a foraging expedition?
Yeah. Well -- no. She's kind of playing hard to get. As a matter of fact, she's playing completely unattainable. So, what's on the schedule? A brisk walk? a foraging expedition?
No -- we're going to attack the termites!
No -- we're going to attack the termites!
Attack? But -- I hate attacking! It's so hostile!
Well, what exactly does our platoon do? Serve beverages? Process paperwork?
Our platoon has the best assignment of all. We're the first into battle!
So we're going back for more armor, right? I mean, these guys are from outer space, how are we supposed to beat them?!
Superior numbers, kid!
Don't be scared, kid. Barbatus's got yer back.
Maybe they went out for the evening. Let's leave them a message and head home.
BARBATUS! You -- you saved my life!
Don't get all sappy about it!
Z! Over here!
Barbatus?
Barbatus!
Be honest, kid -- am I hurt bad?
Be honest, kid -- am I hurt bad?
No, no, you're...lookin' good. You've got good color in your cheeks.
No, no, you're...lookin' good. You've got good color in your cheeks.
No -- I can see it in your eyes. I'm a goner. It's alright, Z. In this ant's army, a soldier's life ain't worth a sack of fungus. I can't feel my legs...
No -- I can see it in your eyes. I'm a goner. It's alright, Z. In this ant's army, a soldier's life ain't worth a sack of fungus. I can't feel my legs...
Hang in there, buddy! You can make it! Just -- take deep breaths, I'll try and find your body -- it's gotta be around here somewhere!

Barbatus, hang on -- Barbatus!!
Don't make my mistake, kid... don't...be a grunt...your whole life...
Princess Bala, sir. Your fiancee.
Princess! You look -- outstanding. Is there anything I can do for you?
Actually, sir, we're ahead of schedule. We have thirty-six seconds available right now.
Outstanding. Princess...?
Fourteen-fifty hours, sir.
Duty calls!
Dammit, this tunnel is priority A-1! We can't afford <u>any delays</u> on this project!
I've never seen anything like it, General, they're they're...well, look!
Notice the big one, holding hands with the female?
Well, uh, who notices workers, sir?
Well, uh, who notices workers, sir?
No one should have to. Have him brought to me.
What do we have on this "Insectopia"?
Scattered reports, sir. Rumors. Nothing reliable.

Ant Team Six...
What are you doing?! ATTACK!! Come on, you yellow-bellies! Don't just stand there, Carpenter! Make an example of yourself!
Uh, actually, we <u>are</u> outnumbered sir...
So this Z...he fancies himself an individual?
Yeah...I mean...well...I don't know, really, sir.
Yeah...I mean...well...I don't know, really, sir.
Well now <u>you</u> haven't fallen for this silly idea of individuality, have you?
Well now <u>you</u> haven't fallen for this silly idea of individuality, have you?
Oh, no, sir!
Oh, no, sir!
Good. You're a good soldier.
Good. You're a good soldier.
Thank you, sir.
So tell me. Where's Z?
I...I have no idea, sir.
I...I have no idea, sir.
Okay, son.
We know what makes an ant colony strong, don't we? We know that no ant can be an individual. No <u>single</u> ant matters, right?
That's correct, sir!
That's correct, sir!
Not that one. Or that one.
Not that one. Or that one.
No, sir!
Lays it on a little thick, doesn't he? If you ask me, he's one giant bore.
Now I've heard a lot of scuttlebutt about a <u>food shortage</u>. Well you boys are gonna be taken care of. But in the meantime we're gonna eat the enemy for <u>breakfast</u>, we are gonna eat the enemy for <u>lunch</u>, and we are gonna eat the enemy for <u>dinner</u>!

Geez, and I forgot my toothbrush.
Geez, and I forgot my toothbrush.
Dammit, I'm proud to be an ant. And I know each and every one of you boys will do your duty. Dismissed.
No -- you -- you don't understand!
Damn, I'm proud of you, boy. I wish I had a hundred ants of your caliber. The world would tremble. Now, time for some R and R. You're invited to the royal victory party!

Of course. The entire royal family will be there to honor you.
Of course. The entire royal family will be there to honor you.
ONE TO NOTHING!
Son, you're an ant after my own heart. A warrior. An ant that looks death right in the face and <u>laughs</u>.
Well, I generally just make belittling comments and snicker behind death's back. So, tell me, fellow war-monger...do you think Princess Bala likes men in uniform?
Well, I generally just make belittling comments and snicker behind death's back. So, tell me, fellow war-monger...do you think Princess Bala likes men in uniform?
Well she better -- she's engaged to one. <u>Me</u>!

Engaged? As in you're getting married?
Engaged? As in you're getting married?
Affirmative.
Affirmative.
So...you two are in love?
So...you two are in love?
In love? I'm just a plain old soldier at heart. I'll tell you what I love -- the field -- blood -- death -- orders...and the company of other warriors.
Wow, what a spread -- you know, there's a food shortage in the rest of the colony.
Yes, and do you know <u>why</u> there's a food shortage?
Yes, and do you know <u>why</u> there's a food shortage?
...Not enough food?
...Not enough food?
Negatory. <u>Too many ants</u>. And while we soldiers go out there, and fight, and bleed, and die for the colony, the namby-pamby workers live it up back home.
Well I, I don't think "living it up" is the right term -- how about "working themselves to death"?
I tell you son, sometimes, at night, I see myself in battle, fighting a horrible, faceless enemy, with the future of our whole species at stake. And always, the dream ends with each of us plunging his sword into the other's heart...

Oh, hey, that's great, I think I see an old war buddy over there, it's been fun chatting. Good luck with the hallucinations.
May I cut in?
Oh, of course --
What's this? A <u>worker</u> has been masquerading as a war hero?!
Well it wasn't a masquerade, really, it was more what I'd call a clever ruse --
Well it wasn't a masquerade, really, it was more what I'd call a clever ruse --
ARREST HIM!
ARREST HIM!
Can't we all settle this like adults -- we're not larvae anymore --
General, the severe food shortage that faces the colony...<u>pains</u> me. The thought of any of my children going hungry... Who's the cutest widdle worker? You are! Yes, you! Don't forget to brush your teeth! Ship 'er out. What steps are you taking to remedy the situation?
We are launching a major offensive to expand our foraging territory...
We are launching a major offensive to expand our foraging territory...
Yes, what else?
Yes, what else?
Please don't worry, your majesty. Leave the worrying to me. As you know, I'm not an ant of half- measures. I don't pussyfoot around. This crisis is my number one priority, and I promise you it's being dealt with swiftly, and decisively.
No snacking between meals! Off you go! Now -- what were we saying?
I do not recollect, your majesty. Will that be all?
I do not recollect, your majesty. Will that be all?
Yes, General Formica. Carry on, my good man! I don't know what we would do without you.
Conversation...yes...well... Wasn't she briefed?
Look, General! A darling baby soldier! Don't try to be a hero! Just make sure you come back in one piece! Next!
Look, General! A darling baby soldier! Don't try to be a hero! Just make sure you come back in one piece! Next!
I'll take your suggestion under advisement, Princess. In the meanwhile --
All these parties are so marvellously <u>alike</u>.
They should be... But there's something funny about that soldier.
Your majesty, I'm afraid matters of state keep me from attending the ceremony.
But General -- this tunnel is your baby! You're sure you can't stay ?
But General -- this tunnel is your baby! You're sure you can't stay ?

Very well, General -- I know you -- all work and no play!
Very well, General -- I know you -- all work and no play!
Alright, let's move out!
I feel...isolated. Different. I've got abandonment issues. My father flew away when I was just a larva. My mother didn't have much time for me...when you have five million siblings, it's difficult to get attention. I feel physically inadequate -- I've never been able to lift more than ten times my own weight. Sometimes I think I'm just not cut out to be a
Terrific! You <u>should</u> feel insignificant!
...I should?
YES!!! You know, people ask me, "Doctor, why are you always happy?" And I tell them it's mind over matter. I don't <u>mind</u> that I don't <u>matter</u>! Do you get it? Do you get it?
Ask me why we're so successful.
Why are we so successful?
Why are we so successful?
I'm glad you asked me that question!
What do you see out there?
...Ants...
...Ants...
Right! Ants! Millions of creatures, each with his assigned task, all pulling together!
You see? Being an ant is being able to say, "Hey -- <u>I'm</u> meaningless, <u>you're</u> meaningless."
But -- but I've always felt life was about finding meaning...and then sharing it with someone special, someone you love.
We declared war again? Are you scared?
I'll be back.
Did you see that? How he gave <u>you</u> the beers, not me? I'm telling you, he's got something against workers.
I don't know what you're talking about, Z.

Weaver, I'm an insect, not a liquid.
Hey, did you hear what he said?!
Poor guy's had one too many scouting missions.
Time to cut a rug, Z!
I'm not in the mood. Even when they're off work, they follow orders.
I'm not in the mood. Even when they're off work, they follow orders.

Get real, Z! She just dropped the scarf by accident!
Are you kidding? There were sparks between us! This scarf is a sign!

What's gonna go wrong?! I take your place for the royal inspection. Bala comes strolling down the line, she sees me -- <u>bingo</u>! Love is rekindled, and she takes me up to the palace for a little... tea and crumpets... and you take your place again, and go march around to your heart's content!
You have to help me. Please, Weaver. Think of all the things I've done for you!

Wear this.
You're a real buddy.
You're a real buddy.
Yeah, I know.
Yeah, I know.
What do I do?

Mrs. Dreyfuss, can I borrow some coffee -- and maybe an orange and a couple of eggs?

I really ought to be getting home. My family will be flipping by now.
You can't leave yet. The doctor says it takes forty-eight hours to get the stuff out of your system.
I wonder how long it takes to get someone you're stuck on out of your system? If they'd only invent some kind of a pump for that --
I know how you feel, Miss Kubelik. You think it's the end of the world -- but it's not, really. I went through exactly the same thing myself.
You did?

Well, maybe not exactly -- I tried to do it with a gun.

Baxter, I picked you for my team because I thought you were a bright young man. You realize what you're doing? Not to me -- but to yourself. Normally it takes years to work your way up to the twenty-seventh floor -- but it takes only thirty seconds to be out on the street again. You dig?

Hi, Baxter.
What do you want?
What do you want?
What do I -- ? Just a minute.
You can't come in.
What's the matter with you, Buddy- boy? I made a reservation for four o'clock, remember?
Look, you can't stay here. Just take your champagne and go.
Baxter, I don't want to pull rank on you -- but I told the lady it was all set -- you want to make a liar out of me?
Baxter, I don't want to pull rank on you -- but I told the lady it was all set -- you want to make a liar out of me?
Are you going to leave, Mr. Kirkeby, or do I have to throw you out?
Buddy-boy, why didn't you say so? You got yourself a little playmate, huh?
Now will you get out?
Say, why don't we have ourselves a party -- the four of us?
No!
Hiya, Buddy-boy. I'm in this bar on Sixty-first Street -- and I got to thinking about you -- and I figured I'd give you a little buzz.
Well, that's very nice of you -- but who is this?

Yes, Mr. Dobisch.
Oh, Buddy-boy. I was just about to call you. I'm sorry about that mess on the living room wall. You see, my little friend, she kept insisting Picasso was a bum -- so she started to do that mural -- but I'm sure it will wash off -- just eyebrow pencil.
It's not Picasso I'm calling about. It's the key -- to my apartment -- you were supposed to leave it under the mat.

I have a vague idea.
We went to bat for you -- and now you won't play ball with us.
Well, after all, it's my apartment -- it's private property -- it's not a public playground.

Well -- thank you.
Always happy to do something for our girls in uniform.
Still afraid somebody may see us together?

Look, Jeff -- we had two wonderful months this summer -- and that was it.

Comes September, the picnic is over -- goodbye. The kids go back to school, the boss goes back

I never said goodbye, Fran.
I never said goodbye, Fran.
For a while there, you try kidding yourself that you're going with an unmarried man. Then one day he keeps looking at his watch, and asks you if there's any lipstick showing, then rushes off to catch the seven-fourteen to White Plains. So you fix yourself a cup of instant coffee -- and you sit there by yourself -- and you think -- and
How do you think I felt -- riding home on that seven-fourteen train?
Why do you keep calling me, Jeff? What do you want from me?
Why do you keep calling me, Jeff? What do you want from me?

Come on, Fran -- don't be like that. You just going to sit there and keep bawling? You won't talk to me, you won't tell me what's wrong -- Look, I know you think I'm stalling you. But when you've been married to a woman for twelve years, you don't just sit down at the breakfast table and say "Pass the sugar -- and

Okay, okay, Fran. I deserve that. But just ask yourself -- why does a man run around with a lot of girls? Because he's unhappy at home -- because he's lonely, that's why -- all that was before you, Fran -- I've stopped running.
How could I be so stupid? You'd think I would have learned by now -- when you're in love with a married man, you shouldn't wear mascara.
It's Christmas Eve, Fran -- let's not fight.

Don't ever talk like that, Fran! Don't make yourself out to be cheap.

Hello, Jeff. Yes, I'm all right.
Fran, why did you do it? It's so childish -- and it never solves anything -- I ought to be very angry with you, scaring me like that -- but let's forget the whole thing -- pretend it never happened -- what do you say, Fran? Fran --
Are you there, Fran?
Of course I'm not here -- because the whole thing never happened -- I never took those pills -- I never loved you -- we never even met -- isn't that the way you want it?
Of course I'm not here -- because the whole thing never happened -- I never took those pills -- I never loved you -- we never even met -- isn't that the way you want it?

Yeah -- typical A.R.V.N.
Then went too far -- he sat there and starts mutilating the centerfold. Poking pins in her an' all that. Sergeant says, don't do her like that. You leave your shitty little hands off that girl. Gook Lieutenant says Fuck you in Vietnamese -- Sergeant says, don't do that again. You'll wish you hadn't. Then he stood up, flicked his iron to rock and
Holy shit.
What did you put in all those ammo boxes?
Arch light.
I hate that -- Every time I hear that noise something terrible happens.

They lined us all up in front of a hundred yards of prime rib -- magnificent meat, beautifully marbled.. Then they started throwing it in these big cauldrons, all of it -- boiling. I looked in, an' it was turning gray. I couldn't stand it. I went into radio school.
I've arranged with those people we saw at Hau Fat to give us some 50 caliber in trade for a couple a drums of fuel --
No shit.

You got to kill this sonuvabitch -- Lance and me, we don''t understand none of this -- Jesus, Captain -- I don't wanna die here -- Do it quick.
Can I go get those mangos now?
I'll go with you in a while -- judt hold tight awhile --
You forgot the mangoes, didn't you?
Mangoes? There as a fucking tiger in the woods -- I could've been eaten alive. I'm never going into that jungle again. I gotta remember never get out of the boat; never get outta the boat.
Elevate Lance, in the tree. No, I saw another.
Thirty meters up, Lance; I saw the fucking flash.
What'd he say?
Said I speak French like a Spanish cow.
Flood.
No -- most of 'em are still standing -- might've been disease.
I met the P.B.R. crew; they were pretty much all kids, except for Phillips, the Chief -- Gunner's Mate Third Class L. Johnson -- Lance Johnson; Gunner's Mate Third Class J. Hicks -- The Chef -- Radio Operator Second Class T. Miller; they called him Mr. Clean.
Chief, try to keep out of where we're going -- Why we're goin' and what's gonna be the big surprise.
Chief, try to keep out of where we're going -- Why we're goin' and what's gonna be the big surprise.
All right with me, I used to drive a taxi.
All right with me, I used to drive a taxi.
Let's go.
The Delta closes off to us about ten miles out of Hau Fat. We'll be able to pick up some supplies -- bit I think there are only two points we can draw enough water to get into the Nung River. It's all Charlie's turf from there on out.
We're gonna have some help to get in the river. You know these waters, Chief ?
We're gonna have some help to get in the river. You know these waters, Chief ?
'Bout six months ago I took a man up to Lo Mung Bridge. He was regular Army too. Shot himself in the head. I brought his body back down.

Shot himself. What for ?
Shot himself. What for ?
Beats me -- the sun was too much for him, or the mud. Who knows ?
Smoke !
Where ?
Yeah -- fishing village -- helicopters over there. Hueys, lots of 'em.
First Air Cavalry. They're the ones gonna get us into the River.
We could go in tomorrow at dawn -- there's always off-shore wind in the morning.
The draft of that river might be too shallow on the point.
Yeah, Chef -- go ahead -- take Lance with you --
I'll go with him --
Careful, Captain, they've been known to charge.
All right I got a little surprise for you --
What're you trying to say, Captain --
You'll see soon enough -- get going, sailor --
You'll see soon enough -- get going, sailor --
No shit -- hot damn --
Wow, you must a found the C.O., eh?
We found some bodies -- let's get out a here.
What about ducking into one of those tributaries till this river slows down?
Who knows what's up there?
Who knows what's up there?
Can't be any worse than this. What do you think?
Can't be any worse than this. What do you think?
I think this river wants to take us home fast. I'm practically goin' in reverse.
Well, get in there.
This whole area is lousy with V.C. -- We don't stand a chance. Lemme turn around and we'll be in Hau Fat in six minutes.
Get in there !
This is my crew and my fucking boat, and I'm the responsible party.
This is my crew and my fucking boat, and I'm the responsible party.
Get in there now or I'll bury you in this river.
What the hell is it?
In the middle of the jungle -- a goddamn light.
They're not Cong.
We're Americans.
I --
I am -- I'm Captain B.L. Willard. This is Chief Warrant Officer Phillips -- it's his boat. We were shot up bad downriver and need repairs and food -- we can pay you in gold.
Rocks, sand -- those two men who deserted.
When'd you do it?
When'd you do it?
While you were sleeping.
Why -- Charlie put it there to kill --
Thta's not Charlie's work --
Whoever put'em there didn't do it to kill people -- They put 'em up as signs --
Signs?
Signs?
Yeah -- like keep out --
Listen.
What is it?
What is it?
Listen.
Will they attack?
If they have boats ... or canoes... they'd get lost in the fog. We can't move either -- we'll end up on the shore.
Two hours after the fog lifted, we moved slowly to a spot we thought was roughly a mile and a half below Kurtz's camp. We approached a long sand-bank stretching down the middle of the river.
Which way? Right or left?
Which way? Right or left?
Who knows? Right.
Who knows? Right.
Looks pretty shallow.
Anybody see some smoke ?
Too far inland.
What cat ?
One that went up for murder -- he was an Army Sergeant.
One that went up for murder -- he was an Army Sergeant.
I never heard about that.
I never heard about that.
Yeah -- he really dug his Playboy mag, man -- I mean like he was there when it arrived -- He just knew.
They nail him for it bad ?
He's in the L.B.J. -- didn't give him no medals or nothing --
Forget that extra drum -- it's too damn hot.
Clear on starboard -- Where's Lance an' the Captain?
Clear on starboard -- Where's Lance an' the Captain?
I saw that Colonel's Huey on the point --
Jesus -- that guy's too damn much.
I wonder if that was the same copter.
What do you want ?
If you're B.L. Willard, 4th Recon Group, we'd like you to come with us.
If you're B.L. Willard, 4th Recon Group, we'd like you to come with us.
Whose orders ?
I only met Kurtz once.
Would he remember you ?
Would he remember you ?
Maybe.
You didn't like him.
Anyone got a cigarette.
What does that mean ?
Maybe it's not Kurtz. I don't believe he's capable of that. I just don't believe it.
Our Recon flight ?
Ours.
Ours.
Touchy.
Touchy.
You can see, of course, the implications, if any of this -- even rumours leaked out.

You want me to clean it up -- simple and quiet.
You want me to clean it up -- simple and quiet.
Exactly -- you'll go up the Nung River in a Navy P.B.R. -- appear at Nu Mung Ba as if by accident, re-establish your acquintance with Colonel Kurtz, find out what's happened -- and why. Then terminate his command.

Terminate with extreme prejudice.
Hey, buddy, that boat still runs, eh?
Yeah, it still runs.
Yeah, it still runs.
Do me a favor buddy, please.
Do me a favor buddy, please.
What is it?
It's to everyone I really knew -- the first girl I screwed -- my brother -- best friend -- I wanted to tell 'em how much I enjoyed knowing 'em -- it's been a great twenty years. I gotta let 'em know.
What're you askin' me for -- put 'em in the first helicopter comes in tomorrow.
What're you askin' me for -- put 'em in the first helicopter comes in tomorrow.
Nobody comes in here.
You got a chance in that boat -- by morning you could be five miles down the river.
We ain't goin' down the river.
Spooky.
Charlie?
Charlie?
No, it'd be spooky without the war -- give 'em back.
What -- happened here.
Charlie?
Charlie?
NVA regulars. They're coming again tonight. Tet -- their big -- assault.
Who is he?
He was the tragedy -- the tragedy of this war.
How did they know?
They must have seen the fire.
Yeah.
Colonel Kurtz, he's dead.
Colonel Kurtz, he's dead.
Yeah.
Captain B.L. Willard, G-4 Headquarters, reporting as ordered, sir.
Okay, Willard, sit down.
No, sir.
This gentleman or myself ?
This gentleman or myself ?
No, sir.
No, sir.
I believe on your last job you executed a tax collector in Kontum, is that right ?
I believe on your last job you executed a tax collector in Kontum, is that right ?
I am not presently disposed to discuss that, sir.
You know much about about Special Forces; Green Berets, Captain ?
I've worked with them on occasions and I saw the movie , sir.
Yeah.
He's commanding the detachment at Nu Mung Ba.
I thought he was a lame.
A lame ?
A lame ?
This is years ago, before he joined Special Forces, I guess. We had an argument.
This is years ago, before he joined Special Forces, I guess. We had an argument.
About what ?

I don't know. He was a lame, that's all.
I don't know. He was a lame, that's all.
But why ?
But why ?
He couldn't get through a sentence without all these big words; about why we kill.
He couldn't get through a sentence without all these big words; about why we kill.
Well, he's killing now.
Well, he's killing now.
Maybe.
Fifty calibers, eh, Captain --
As I said, we can pay you in gold.
As I said, we can pay you in gold.
Entirely unnecessary, Captain.
American weapons?
We took them from the dead. Now -- I assume you want to rest, to shower. We'll attend to your repairs after dinner.
We don't want to bother you any, we --
A man of war is never bothered to aid an ally -- you will follow me, Captain.
A habit of men of war, sir -- you understand.
Of course, Captain -- an unfortunate necessity.
It is very good -- there is no current -- It is very good. I have never seen one like it in all Indochina. I was in Paris when it arrived -- do you know what might have caused --
Looks like a two thousand pound to me. Yeah, a two thousand pound bomb.
Looks like a two thousand pound to me. Yeah, a two thousand pound bomb.
No, I've seen those in Normandy. This is much better. My country -- my country could never originate this. Magnificent.
Attacks repulsed, as I was saying. This is only for this war, Captain. Viet Cong -- 54; North Vietnamese regular forces -- 15; South Vietnamese -- 28 -- regular forces and otherwise. Americain -- 6. Of course, they were, perhaps, mistakes, Captain.
Of course. I -- Once we make our repairs, we could send word, we could have you evacuated from here.
Of course. I -- Once we make our repairs, we could send word, we could have you evacuated from here.
Captain?
Captain?
You'll get blown outta here some day.
You'll get blown outta here some day.
We will never 'evacuate', Captain -- this is our home. Indochina is ours; it has been so for a hundred and twenty-one years, there is something to say for that.

The Vietnamese think it's theirs -- I guess the Americans do, too.

But we civilized it. A place belongs to those who bring light to it, don't you agree.

I always thought the French came here to get the rubber.
Upriver? Why upriver? There is nothing there, only jungle.
Do you know that jungle?
Do you know that jungle?
When I was a boy, my father would take me there, to hunt. There are a few savages, but no man can live there, no white man.
When I was a boy, my father would take me there, to hunt. There are a few savages, but no man can live there, no white man.
What about an American named Kurtz?
Two of my men deserted last night. It happens from time to time. I assume my daughter told you of our conditions.
Your daughter.
I guess this is whAt men of war do -- eh?
We endure, captain -- you can blow up the house and we will live in the cellar -- destroy that and we'll dig a hole in the jungle and sleep on it. Burn the forest and we'll hide in the swamp. all the while, we do but one thing -- clean the blood off our bayonets. Au revoir, Captain.
What's your name, sailor ?
Gunner's Mate, Third Class -- L. Johnson, sir.
Gunner's Mate, Third Class -- L. Johnson, sir.
Lance Johnson? The surfer?
Lance Johnson? The surfer?
That's right, sir.
It's an honor to meet you Lance. I've admired your nose-riding for years -- I like your cutback, too. I think you have the best cutback there is.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, sir.
You can cut out the sir, Lance -- I'm Bill kilgore -- I'm a goofy foot.
Where've you been riding, Lance?
I haven't surfed since I got here.
I haven't surfed since I got here.
That's terrible -- we'll change that -- I'd like to see you work -- I've always liked your cutback; got a hell of a left turn, too.
Good swell.
What, sir?
What, sir?
I said it's a good swell -- hell of a good swell 'bout six feet. Let's get a look at it.
You think that section on the point is ridable, Lance?
I think we ought to wait for the tide to come in.
They far enough?
Sure -- fine --
You smell that. You smell that?
What?
What?
Napalm, boy -- nothing else in the world smells like that --
The wind --
What?
Yeah, I'm an artist, goddamit !
Yeah -- yeah, I can understand how you feel.
Mike, you know anything about the point at Vin Drip Drop?
Boss left.
Boss left.
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
It's really long left slide, breaks on the short side of the point -- catches a south swell.
Why the hell didn't you tell me about that place -- a good left. There aren't any good left slides in this whole, shitty country. It's all goddamn beach break.
It's hairy ,though. That's where we lost McDonnel -- they shot the hell out of us. It's Charlie's point.
It's hairy ,though. That's where we lost McDonnel -- they shot the hell out of us. It's Charlie's point.

Captain B-L. Willard, sir -- 4th Recon Group -- I carry priority papers from Com-Sec Intelligence 11 Corp -- I believe you understand the nature of my mission.
Yeah -- Na Trang told me to expect you -- we'll see what we can do. Just stay out of my way till this is done, Captain.
My orders are from Com-Sec Intel -- B.L. Willard, 4th Recon --
Just hold up a second, Captain -- I'll get to you soon enough -- We've got things to do here.

Mercenaries -- agents, traitors -- they put out caches.
Mercenaries -- agents, traitors -- they put out caches.
Can you trust them?
Can you trust them?
No. They put out two or three for every one I needed. When you get to the one you'll use, you just stake it out. If something feels wrong, you just pass it up. On one mission, I had to pass up three and ended up living on rats and chocolate bars.

Music?
Music?
Yeah. Classical stuff -- scares the hell out of the slopes -- the boys love it.
Fucking savages.
Who?

It'll get here, soldier.
You know, some day this war's gonna end..

You know you're right.
Do you know me?
Yes.
Yeah, I can see that. He's fuckin nuts --
Yeah.
I said get the fuck out ! I'm going to kill the little weirdo myself tomorrow. He's only stayed alive this long because he's a good orderly and medic. He knows how to use a hypodermic.
You're gonna get hit tonight, bad -- a whole regiment of NVA regulars.
You're gonna get hit tonight, bad -- a whole regiment of NVA regulars.
That's right, the little gook- pricks. But they are noble little gook-pricks, noble. Because they fight with their guts, like animals. And for an idea ! That's rich. We fight with ingenious machines and fire, like Gods, and for nothing. But I'll call in a major blotto airstrike tonight. We'll have ourselves a helluva airstrike tonight, a lightshow. How do you like The Doors':
Do you?
Yeah, I like it...

What Truth?
What Truth?
The truth that you were sent here to murder me, ans so far you haven't done it. And do you know why? Yes, you know why. Your mission makes about as much sense as those idiots who sent you on it. Asshole ! Schmuck ! How long does it take you to figure out that nobody knows what they're doing here. Except me.
Gimme water.
No water.
No water.
You know what you're doing? You are interfering with my plans !

Stinks. I could never figure -- I could never figure how they can teach boys how to bomb villages with napalm -- and not let them write the word 'fuck' on their airplanes.
You could never figure it because it doesn't make sense.
Fuck no.
Fuck no.
I'll tell you what makes sense ! Air strikes ! White Phosphorus ! Napalm ! We'll bomb the shit out of them if they don't do what we want.

Maybe he'll get inside the tube -- where -- where they can't see him.
What's that?
Just something I read in the Free Press.
He'll kill us.
He can't kill us. We're on his side.
Are you finished surfing?
Yeah... thanks.
Yeah... thanks.
Want to say goodbye to the Colonel?

The Yater -- the clear one with the thin stringer.
This one , Lance?
Yeah, Jesus Christ !
Maybe we better stay in under the trees till dark -- we got his Yater.
He didn't look like he'd take that sitting down.
You hear it again?
No -- I don't think so. But it'll be back. They were circling. It'll be back.
No -- I don't think so. But it'll be back. They were circling. It'll be back.

Sure.
Sure.
And you could just tell when the supplies were booby trapped?
And you could just tell when the supplies were booby trapped?
It's a feeling you get in the jungle. When you get good, you can find a track and tell not only how many they are, but their morale, how far they're going, whether they're near their camp, the weapons they're carrying.
What's this tiger shit?
No shit... I think I shot the hell out of him.
No shit... I think I shot the hell out of him.
You think?
You think?
I wasn't looking.. I was running.
The other one --

Bring your rifles, that's all. Take us to him.
Captain Willard?
That's me.

Where's Kurtz? I want to talk to him.
Oh, you don't talk to Colonel Kurtz. You listen to him. God, these are good. I kept these people off you, you know. It wasn't easy.

Why did they attack us?

Simple. They don't want him to go.

You're Australian?

Pre-Australian, actually. But I'd dig goin' to California. I'm California dreamin'.
Pre-Australian, actually. But I'd dig goin' to California. I'm California dreamin'.
So Kurtz is alive.
So Kurtz is alive.
Kurtz. I tell you, that man has enlarged my mind.
But lemme tell you, he is the most dangerous thing in every way that I've come on so far. He wanted to shoot me. The first thing he said is, 'I'm going to shoot you because you are a deserter.' I said I didn't desert from your army, I deserted from my army. He said, 'I'm going to shoot you just the same.'
Why didn't he shoot you?
Why didn't he shoot you?
I've asked myself that question. I said to myself, why didn't he shoot me? He didn't shoot me, because I had a stash like you wouldn't believe. I hid it in the jungle; the wealth of the Orient: Marijuana -- Hashish -- Opium -- cocaine -- uncut Heroin; the Gold of the Golden Triangle. and Acid -- I make Koolaid that makes purple Owsley
Sounds like he's gone crazy.
No, Colonel Kurtz couldn't be crazy -- if you heard him talk, just last week, you'd never think he was crazy.

Is that where he is? By the shrunken heads.

We're going ashore. Tie her up -- and leave your guns up, Lance.
Right on -- he's been waiting for --
And shut up.
Who are you?
His name is...
His name is...
I'm not ever goin' to tell you to shut up again.
May I ask where the Captain is going in his little boat?
We were going upriver when we got caught in a storm, ma'am.
You must realize, Captain -- we have lost much here -- I, my husband. Gaston -- his wife and son.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Cognac?
Cognac?
I should be checking on the boat.
I should be checking on the boat.
The war will still be here tomorrow.
Do you miss your home, Captain? Have you someone there?
No. Not really.
What will you do after the war?
I just follow my footsteps, one at a time, trying to answer the little questions and staying away from the big ones.
I just follow my footsteps, one at a time, trying to answer the little questions and staying away from the big ones.
What's a big question?

Kurtz. I know you've heard of him.

Yes.
Yes.
What did you hear?
What did you hear?
That strange things.. terrible things have occured around this American, Kurtz.

Gaston would never tell me. It was asubject not to be spoken of, Captain.

Yes.
Yes.
Did you know -- deeper in the jungle, upriver -- there are savages?
Did you know -- deeper in the jungle, upriver -- there are savages?
I know.
I know.
But Captain, I mean -- cannibals.
Are you warm, Captain?
The river is beautiful.
I'm afraid I won't have time -- I gotta --
Whe you reach the boat you will find that half your fifty calibre stores -- a case of grenades, a mortar and two M-16's and a case of clips are being transfered to us by your order.
So that's it.
You may think what you wish, Captain, but I like you very much.
What if I say no.
Then Philippe will have to kill all of you.
I don't know anything about these papers, sir.
They're in order -- it's perfectly clean -- just check with ComSec- Intel like I said.
They're in order -- it's perfectly clean -- just check with ComSec- Intel like I said.

20 CONTINUED:
You can pack out of here -- two, three days' hike along this river at most. Weather should hold this early in the season.
23 CONTINUED:
Needs patching.
Hard to work up an interest in politics, way we live. You're the first people we've seen in two weeks.
23 CONTINUED:
30 CONTINUED:
Now, why don't you get around to saying what you want.
34 CONTINUED:
Mind if I get some stuff from my kit?
See the blood? Pack of wolves took down a moose. Greedy, gut-ripping sons of bitches. I'd kill the last wolf on earth, right in front of the President of the U.S. Stinking, cowardly predator, the wolf.
89 CONTINUED:
102 CONTINUED:
Wait 'til I'm across!
You talk about ecology -- there it is.
107 CONTINUED:
117 CONTINUED:
Inside of three hours you'd be dragging my dead carcass.
134 CONTINUED:
Used to see the natives eating roots when I was a kid in Nome.
First you save my ass, now you want to kill me. Make up your goddamn mind.
134 CONTINUED:
What makes you so sure my boys won't be waiting for us?
139 CONTINUED:
Remember that demon in the gut? Sometimes it's nothing more than wondering if the so-called civilized life has bred the balls and brains out of you. That's what you want out of this, isn't it?
150 CONTINUED:
Relax. I got a nervous man here with a magnum up my nose.
175 CONTINUED:
215 CONTINUED:
So they can patch me up and put me in a cage? Forget it. Meyerling's right -- I'm a dinosaur. Greedy bastards like him, it's their turn with this land. Put me in the woods, let me live or die on my own.
Avalanche season is coming.
43 CONTINUED:
48 CONTINUED:
I'll get you there all right.
Let's go.
94 CONTINUED:
95 CONTINUED:
It'll be interesting, trying to build a fire without any wood.
113 CONTINUED:
I just want this over with.
119 CONTINUED:
How? Nobody this far north monitors that frequency until avalanche season. Besides, I'm surprised a tough guy like you uses fancy electronics.
...I won't let a killer walk!
157 CONTINUED:
165 CONTINUED:
There isn't one, unless Corbett's men get here before the plane does.
165 CONTINUED:
I'd sure like that favor you offered a while back.
You'll catch a chill by that dumb waiter shaft. Sit on the cot. Keep this pointed at him if I get preoccupied.
168 CONTINUED:
184 CONTINUED:
Your infrared camera?
212 CONTINUED:
Keep back.
26 CONTINUED:
I was making my rounds, saw your hangar wide open, plane getting rained on, so I closed it up.
Watch it with Meyerling. Man's as mean and corrupt as they get. Cut his mother's throat if it'd get him a couple votes.
26 CONTINUED:
27 CONTINUED:
Question is why they sat here when the storm moved in. Check their stuff while I sniff around.
A certain sonofabitch bastard -more-
28 CONTINUED:
39 CONTINUED:
Back against the bars. Now.
How long have you been up north?
Six months.
Six months.
Can't be. Too keen a sense of this place in your pictures.
My dad was a Navy doctor.
Knew you had no native blood, even with your dark hair. Blue eyes give you away. My wife had blue eyes.

Had?
Had?
She's dead.
She's dead.
Oh.
Oh.
Had some good years. Met her in '66. She showed up one day in Coldfoot. No one knew her. One Sunday morning, she marched into a bar and announced she was available as a wife to the highest bidder. Didn't work out in three months, she'd return the money and leave, no hard feelings. My bid was eight thousand dollars. Beautiful girl.

How did she..?
How did she..?
I was gone, in September, laying traplines. She went to our cache for some meat. Got mauled by a bear. Tore open her skull. -more-
What about you -- why come back? Classy girl like you seems more suited to the finer things.
That's why I left, moved to Washington. When I met Eric I was doing day shoots -- products and fashion, mostly. Pretty dull. Eric was teaching college, and then he got the job with Northland Oil. We wanted to stay together, so we talked them into funding some wilderness photography... and here I am.
You should know something.
I don't want to talk any more.
I don't want to talk any more.
Wasn't my intention to hurt Wilder. I'm telling you the truth. I liked the man. I only meant to get loose... to survive. Your cheechako boyfriend better understand that. Listen, I've got some money put away --
Have you talked to Eric?
I have not, but I very much want to. What do you know about the trouble in Devil's Cauldron?
I have not, but I very much want to. What do you know about the trouble in Devil's Cauldron?
I was hoping you had some news --
-- Get this straight: I'm the District Supervisor. Whatever you do reflects on me. It wasn't my idea to bring you people up here, but I'm stuck with you. You are absolutely not to involve yourself in any local disputes. Whichever side you take, you alienate the other. Mr. Corbett is quite well-known in this region. People admire him --
-- Corbett's a killer.
What happened here?
The radio's on the fritz.

Where'd you say Eric is?

What about that hotheaded marshal, Sam Wilder? I heard he was in the middle of this mess.

Really. I thought maybe that was his snowmobile outside. By the way -- your truck also 'on the fritz?'
Really. I thought maybe that was his snowmobile outside. By the way -- your truck also 'on the fritz?'
Why?
Why?
It's out by the pumping station, shot full of holes.
He's coming around fine.
Be right back. I left my camcorder in the car.
What are you doing?
He still might be around. I saw fresh tire tracks coming in.
Stay here.
Be careful -- there're two of them.
Great idea -- pointing a lousy dart gun at some nut with a high-powered hunting rifle.
Bastards took off, though, didn't they?
Thanks.
I bet you haven't had lunch.
I call it 'the Turtle,' as in carrying your home on your back.
Best thing is, Meyerling has to chase around to find us.

The little creep hates it that Eric actually does what the company hired him to do.
I'll go into town with you.
Eric, leave it alone. It's not your business.
Eric, leave it alone. It's not your business.
No way can he get away with this. I'll be back by tonight.
Did you catch Corbett?
Sure did. He was one of the trappers we rousted from the Haul Road.

Going after killers isn't the same as chasing poachers, Eric.
Can't help myself. Corbett's type always pisses me off. Oh, I found this at the post office. Had your name on it.
Oh, sweetheart. It's beautiful!
You were looking at it in the catalog. Don't know where you can wear it...

Do I want to be with you permanently? Yes, I think I do. But be with what you do and the way you live? That I don't know. C'mon, Eric, until I met you, coming back to Alaska was totally
I still can't believe I'm being financed by an oil company. Especially when they get a look at these pictures. Technology in the wilderness; not too pretty. What's that?
I thought I should check our emergency transmitters.
Winter. Two straight months of night -- we may never get out of bed. Which would suit me fine.
Prolonged darkness makes people crazy.
Prolonged darkness makes people crazy.
Not me. I'm equipped.
High-tech in the wilderness. Gets me excited, too.
Come here...
Let's go.
Wait a second.
Maybe you should drive him into Devil's Cauldron, let them decide what to do with him.
Fairbanks is a three-hour flight. I'll be back by dinnertime.
Be careful, okay?
That's my line.
Oh, Christ, sweetheart. Four days! I thought you were dead, or worse.
You can't stay here. Go back to the Turtle. I'll meet you back there in a few hours.
You can't stay here. Go back to the Turtle. I'll meet you back there in a few hours.
What's going on?

Here. A transport plane is due at eleven. Once I put him on it, it's all over.
Here. A transport plane is due at eleven. Once I put him on it, it's all over.
So what's the problem?
Please, Anne Marie, you being here only complicates things.
I'm staying.
You're hurt.
Nothing broken. C'mon, we have to hurry.
Technology in the wilderness. Only problem is talking to you on your way to the landing strip.
I've got an idea. We'll have to work fast.
When you ran off, I thought you'd keep going 'til you were back home in Washington.
My home is here. With you.
Leave it here.
Let's keep going. We're only an hour from Devil's Cauldron.
Let's keep going. We're only an hour from Devil's Cauldron.
Relax. I just want to ask them how the hunting is.
Had no choice... ...Given the situation.
I know. Least you didn't shoot all of them.
Go ahead. Take the jeep. I'll come to Cache with Bob when he gets here.
Okay by me. You're the one likes these hot springs so much.
Okay by me. You're the one likes these hot springs so much.
Leave my traps. We'll tag up, couple days.
You got two counts against you -- trapping out of season and poaching on restricted land.
Can't be much of a crime, if all they got minding the area is a cocky kid.
Can't be much of a crime, if all they got minding the area is a cocky kid.
I got your plate number, asshole. Maybe you feel like spending a few months in jail.
Ben Corbett?
Yep. Afraid you have me at a disadvantage.

Kenai at the general store asked me to bring these. Didn't expect we'd already met.

Ecology. Folks use that term for everything but what it means: who's eating who.
Nice bluff the other day with the tranquilizer gun out your jeep window. See you again, maybe.
Yeah. Maybe so.
A lot to ask, dragging him away from such a good-looking girl --
-- To take you to jail? It'll be my pleasure.
Does he have people?
A daughter in Oregon.
A daughter in Oregon.
Send him down to her. There's money in my duffel bag, back at his cabin.
Surviving is what I know --
-- Killing is what you know. Pack some food while I prep for the flight. I'm sure not gonna let him go.
How the hell were they smart enough to find us?
Smart? Sure. That's why I'm sitting in this plane and they're down there blowing me kisses.
Been driving long?
I needed a pilot's license to take the job here, so I got one in six weeks.
I needed a pilot's license to take the job here, so I got one in six weeks.
That makes the flight more interesting.
Sounds like professional jealousy.
Hunting and trapping was a damn fine life. Me and Mitchell, Bob and LeMalle, we were teams. I'd always go with Mitchell. Good man, Mitchell. I'd let Bob worry about goddamn LeMalle. We'd hire a plane in October. On the way to a dirt airstrip somewhere, we'd drop supplies. We'd land, tell the pilot to come back for us a few days before Christmas.
Stay put!
You got the belly to look me in the eye and pull the trigger?
Next time you want to kill yourself, don't include me.
I took the odds on getting down in one piece, and I made it. Now we're in my territory.
I took the odds on getting down in one piece, and I made it. Now we're in my territory.
With light clothing and no supplies, this is nobody's territory.
With light clothing and no supplies, this is nobody's territory.
You sound like the tourists. Know-it-alls who read about survival in a magazine. Fuck you. You won't make it off this mountain.
I'm not gonna carry you out of here.
That's right. You're not.
That's right. You're not.
Look, take these cuffs off. We need to work together.
Why in hell you care enough about me to die taking me in?
I don't plan on dying.
We'll stop here, dig out a snow shelter.
Snow shelter. Okay. You dig. I'll have a little sit-down.
Still quite a hike to Devil's Cauldron. Days. A long stretch to go without sleep, my friend. You can hide behind that pistol for now, but take your eyes off me long enough to sneeze --
-- Turn around.
Ice is too thin -- you can see the water moving underneath.
We're not sitting here 'til November. There's a cargo plane coming to Devil's Cauldron in four days, and I'm putting you on it.
We're not sitting here 'til November. There's a cargo plane coming to Devil's Cauldron in four days, and I'm putting you on it.

I've been on ice like this when I was a kid, skating. Spread your weight, keep moving. Go on.
Be my guest.
I'm right behind you.
Most dangerous thing in the world: A regular Joe, in over his head. You trying to prove how tough you are for me, or for yourself?
It wasn't my idea to crash the plane.

Let's camp. There's grayling under this ice. I'll snare some for dinner.

Pushing it is flat wrong. All you prove is your ignorance about breaking trail.
Have to backtrack, find another way down.
Forget it. It would take days.
Forget it. It would take days.
Going to be a bit of a challenge with handcuffs on.
Damn lucky this storm didn't blow down when we were on those baldheaded mountains. It continues, we better stay put.
It could blow over tomorrow, too.

I'm still figuring: You're either real brave or real dumb.
Where in hell Meyerling dig you up?
You know Meyerling?
You know Meyerling?
Sure. The People's Friend. Kiss your ass with precision if there's a vote in it.
Sure love to know where you fit in up here.
I'm here to do my job.
I'm here to do my job.
You want to fool yourself about that bullshit job, fine. Damn shame you have to drag your girlfriend along. You think a woman like that will be happy making moose stew for a man -more-
Folks come to Alaska for a real short list of reasons: Money. Adventure. Solitude. Those cover most everyone. But frontiers also draw another type of man. One with a demon in his gut. He comes to the edge of the world to face that demon, and lay it to rest.
Yeah?
Yeah?
Yep. Sometimes they do, but usually they end up crazy or dead.
There's a cabin, maybe twenty miles south of here.
Too bad we're heading west.
Too bad we're heading west.
There's a snowmobile. Inside a day we could be on the Yukon. I got money there. Remember that five thousand? Make it ten. Be smart. Take it and walk away.

You don't get it, do you?
Have to get these wet things off.
You're not going to slow us down! Keep moving!
Stay awake! You want to go hypothermic?
If that means freeze my balls off, no thanks. I'll be okay.
Told you I'm fine!
How many do you see?

I'm hungry. Go kill me some dinner.
An appetite. Maybe you won't die after all.

Hate to disappoint you.
Nome? I figure you'd be a whaler, coming from there.
Told that's what our old man was. Planned on going to sea, me and Bob, 'til I read Jack London. Started trapping when I was ten. Mailed the furs to Sears. Eight bucks for a skunk, three for a muskrat. That was fine money.

Killing wildlife not good enough anymore, so you go on to bigger and better things.
Killing wildlife not good enough anymore, so you go on to bigger and better things.
You got a knack for seeing things the way you want to see them.
Don't judge me. You're a joke, coming here from a fucked-up culture, telling us what to do!
Yeah, it is fucked up -- but it's not too late to keep that from happening here.
Yeah, it is fucked up -- but it's not too late to keep that from happening here.
All you do is keep folks from working the land, living like they're meant to. You don't understand shit! Trappers, hunters -- we're part of the environment. Who's protecting us? I've seen plenty like you. So -more-
What do you know about people? You live like an animal! A savage goddamn throwback like you belongs out here, as far away from the rest of us as possible.
I'm real sad you don't approve of me.
Don't push me..!
Cowardly bastard. I'm in handcuffs and I still scare the piss out of you.
They think you're in Fairbanks. If not, they still won't find you before the plane comes tomorrow.
Don't bet on it.
Don't bet on it.
I already have.
I already have.
You don't know how true that is.
Maybe...maybe not. I'll tell you what scares me -- stumbling through life, like an ordinary jerk. That's why I want to work on the front lines, where what I do means something. Soon as I got here, I realized my job was bullshit. Oil company propaganda. I was ready to leave, then I thought screw it, I'll outsmart them, do the work anyway. I
Hell, I still get a knot in my gut every season, wondering how much longer I can go on. No 'Home for Retired Trappers' that -more-
Talk to that good-looking girl of yours?
You broke the radio, remember?
You broke the radio, remember?
I'm sure she's fine. Seemed like a clever kid.
You were real resourceful out there. Got me thinking of this perimeter man, froze all his fingers one winter. So he hacked the tips off and sharpened the exposed bones. Gets along better than ever. Yeah, maybe I underestimated you.
I liked you better frozen. You didn't talk so much.
I liked you better frozen. You didn't talk so much.
You're damn lucky, glimpsing this country before it's ruined, gone for good. You saw wonders you'd only dreamed of. That alone makes you different than the sorry bastards back where you came from, because you have dreamt them.
Emergency transmitter? What happened to signal mirrors or two-tone smoke fires?
Lets us watch each other's backs over a wide area. Only thing messed me up this time was getting arrested in the baths. ELT was in my duffel bag, not around my neck where it should've been.

No way they'll find you on a five-minute signal. And no way -more-
Maybe you can talk sense into your boyfriend.
Shut up!
Shut up!

Answer and I'll shoot!
You kill me, you sign your death warrant. And hers.
Snow's to their advantage, kid. You can't see them, but soon as that plane comes, they'll sure as hell know where we're going. Wise up. Take me to the Yukon. I'll give you that money and guarantee you'll walk away.
Why offer a buyoff with your gunmen waiting outside?

Like I said, I'd still be up on that mountain, frozen solid, it wasn't for you.
Like I said, I'd still be up on that mountain, frozen solid, it wasn't for you.
We'll get you to a hospital, soon as we get to Fairbanks.
Look down there, tell me what any of this matters. Struggles of men get swallowed by the bigness. Soon there won't be a trace of our troubles... or us.
You're wrong. Everything we do leaves its mark. You said it yourself -- there are hundred- year-old footprints in the tundra.
Hullo, Sam. Slow day?
Ben...boys. Yeah, real slow, and I'd like to keep it that way.
Ben...boys. Yeah, real slow, and I'd like to keep it that way.

You wouldn't shoot anyone...
But I would.
All this for laying traps on private land?
You left a footprint at the Sportsmen's camp. Only pretty sight there, Ben, 'cause the two men you didn't shoot and mutilate died of exposure.
Christ if I shouldn't know better than to step in soft earth. I've seen footprints in the tundra a hundred years old.
I got it from here. Thanks.
I got it from here. Thanks.
Sam, give Dixie here fifty bucks out of my kit, will you?
Sam, listen -- I shot to defend my man. Other guy drew first.
If that was all, fine. But carving him up, stranding the others, that's too fucking much. Is everything that walks, crawls, flies or swims fair game to you?

I'll get loose before that plane comes.

Don't try me. I'll kill you if it comes to it.
You better get some sleep.
Good idea. Flying over mountains can give you some nasty surprises. Go too low, one of the clouds might have a big rock inside it.
Goddammit, I don't need this aggravation. I'll shoot you, Ben. Bank on it.
I don't want to hurt you, Sam.
I don't want to hurt you, Sam.
I'm not too old to knock the snot out of you!

Pretty clever: If the trappers got that signal beacon and get here in time, Sam's is the first place they'll look. They may figure you're waiting for an airplane, so you can't stay in the shack by the airstrip. Last place they'd expect you is on the far side of town. I can't afford any trouble --

Mr. Desmond! Arthur Neff. Area rep for the Federal Assistance Plan. Tell the boys in DC to keep those goodies coming.
Sure.
Sure.
Snowplow, generator, TV dish... hell, we get the goddamn Playboy Channel! Here, this is for you.
You don't mind me saying, Mr. Desmond, you look like hell.
Have you heard anything from the girl staying with me, Anne Marie?

Not a damn thing. What's going on? Mr. Meyerling was here, all steamed up, looking for you.

Look, Neff, I've got Ben Corbett with me --

Back at my place... he, uh, broke his leg.
If Corbett's men find out --

Jiminy Christmas. What do you want from me?
Jiminy Christmas. What do you want from me?
Corbett ruined my two-way. Go to my place on the Haul Road, tell Anne Marie I'm okay and to sit tight.
What's wrong?
Just stay out of my face until I'm gone!
I was just on my way to your ladyfriend's, but I guess she found you.
Yeah. Sorry I barked at you last night.
Yeah. Sorry I barked at you last night.
I'm the one should be sorry... Goddamn Kenai, always out for a score. I never should've let him go over there.
Look, Mr. Desmond, I didn't count on it turning this ugly.
What are you talking about?

Bastards killed Sam, you think they won't kill the rest of us?

I'm real sorry. In a while, you're gone from this country. But we live here. No one wants to mix it up with those hombres.
You don't care enough about Sam to --
-- Sam Wilder was my cousin. He's why I came to Alaska. All his letters, saying what a paradise it is. But me ending up dead won't do Sam a lick of good.
Neff, you know better than this...
You're an outsider, Mr. Desmond. Step aside; stay out of it.
Alleged killer.
What does this matter to you?
What does this matter to you?
You can't see past your lousy little assignment, sniffing around the pipeline. The few voters there are in this district look up to Corbett, and I'm not about to alienate them.

This miserable wilderness is a state of the union. Policy's made here the same way as in the civilized world: at the ballot box. That's the beauty of it -- these icebox cowboys are living a century too late. Get them on your side, it's like buying Manhattan for beads. With a handful of votes you control the greatest frontier since white men stumbled

Some day these people'll wake up, and you'll be the first one they'll run out of here.
Nobody wants any more killings; we all agree to that, correct? That's good. Now, Eric, you're gonna hand your prisoner over to us.
Fuck you.
Fuck you.
This isn't your concern. It's over, here and now.
Bet you're right. But I didn't come by to wangle a meal --
-- We appreciate the company. Anne Marie's getting cabin fever already.
What'd you say they call these spaceships?
Mobile Arctic Dwelling -- MAD.
Hey, Sam, look over there. Black and white smoke.
Damn. Likely that's an SOS. Have to pass on that lunch.
Damn. Likely that's an SOS. Have to pass on that lunch.
We'll go with you.
I'm too old for this shit.
Any idea who could've done it?
...You give us a ride in the Cessna you got hangared at the pumping station, we'll be in Fairbanks in a few hours.
That's what we should've done in the first place.
That's what we should've done in the first place.
I could've sat tight for the transport, 'til Bob came poking around.
Wilder's missing church services; you believe it?
I just as soon he stay gone. Fool could've got us all killed, arresting Ben Corbett here in town.
Why the smirk?
Bet I could make some money turning Ben Corbett in. Maybe more for lettin' him loose. I was up in my cache. Saw the Northland man come talk to you.

Stay out of it.
He saw you and Corbett come in...
Dixie's waiting at the infirmary. She'll put a splint on that injured leg.
Dead. Trappers killed him.
Aw, Jesus. Told you this was trouble. What about you, big shot? Do something. Who's side are you on, anyway?
LeMalle. We got a problem. Where's Mitchell?
Goddamn! Viking Bob! Mitchell's inside, boring bastard...
There you go. Wilder's always chummy with the fuckin' Bambi-lovers.
It's a long shot.
I called the cops in Fairbanks, see when Ben is standing trial. They don't know shit about Ben or Wilder!
Get the fuck out of here.
Get the fuck out of here.
It's a three-hour flight. They shoulda got there yesterday.

Maybe they went back to Devil's Cauldron.
Go easy.
Cool out. I ain't about to get blasted.
I ain't gonna leave a seven- hundred-dollar Remington behind.
What you gonna do with it? Large bore's for shit on small game.

Thought that door was open last night...
Quit fucking around. Get in.
Look, we pull Ben's ass out of the fire, I'll get you a whole damn crate of Snickers bars.
I'm right fuckin' here with you.
You hear me? Ben?
Ease off. We do this my way.
Kenai's PA -- but how the fuck she seein' us?
Doesn't matter. We know where they're going. C'mon.
...Ben never sent a signal.
Musta never got a chance to -more-
Meaning he'll need a plane.
Closest planes for hire are here in Cache.

Hang on... Remember that Cessna we saw at the pumping station on the Haul Road? Belongs to the guy they got patrolling the pipeline.
Naah, Wilder knows we got friends in town.
That plane might've been to throw us off the track. Remember the bait-and-switch Wilder pulled with the Eskimo and his truck?
Okay, let's backtrack, try to pick up his trail. You know the kid out on the pipeline that Wilder's buddies with?
We were just talking about him.
It's Sam Wilder!
Musta wanted to keep him from the bears. If Ben killed him, he sure as hell wouldn't hang him up like this.

Where's the kid?
There's what they're waiting on!
They'll have to come right past us.
This is Sam Wilder, Marshal in Devil's Cauldron. Had some killings here. I got a suspect; be real nice if someone came and took him off my hands.
On a good day I couldn't spare a crosswalk guard. But now, no way. Folks're batshit with the weather turning sour. Bring him in yourself.

I didn't know you had a secret admire.
Huh?

You met the gift.
There is a seriously goofy man behind this. You are not allowed to block out that fact.
Do you really want to go back to the runt doctors in Emergency who keep telling us they can't help?

Spencer is okay. You'd better start finding something else to do with your free time. If you can't feel good about this break and step out a little... You ought to get Mr. Udall to send you over a psychiatrist.

I don't need one 'cause I know what's really going on here. I have to finish this letter or I'll go nuts. This can't be right -- con- science.
I don't know... It's very strange not feeling that stupid panic thing inside you all the time. Without that you just start thinking about yourself -- and what does that ever get anybody. Today, on the bus there was this adorable couple and I felt myself giving them a dirty look -- I had no idea everything was...
Go ahead.
Go ahead.
... moving in the wrong direction... Away from when I even remembered what it was like to have a man to... anything... hold fucking -- sorry -- hands with, for Christ's sake. I was feeling like really bad that Dr. Bettes is married. Which is probably why I make poor Spencer hug me more than he wants to... Like the poor kid doesn't have

What is it you want? What?
I want us to go out.
How was it talking to him?
Stop treating this like I'm going away with a man. He's just going to say those crappy, sick, complaining, angry things to me. I hate this, Mom -- I hate this. He's a freak show -- the worst person I ever met.

Well, maybe he has nice friends.
Call me as soon as you're settled.
I love you.
Stop it!! Why can't I have a normal boyfriend??? Why? Get out of here. Just a regular boyfriend who doesn't go nuts on me...
Everybody wants that, dear -- it doesn't exit... Sorry... didn't mean to interrupt.
I'm sorry.
Don't be silly. How bad?

Tell me how bad it is. I let him go out last night when it was so cool without an overshirt -- just and underone with just the straps and I know better... and I let him talk me into it. He was whining and... you don't need this. Give me a second to catch hold.

No.
No.
An ear infection can send us to the emergency room -- maybe five, six times a month where I get whatever nine-year-old they just made a doctor. Nice chatting with you.

You all set here?

Thanks, Melvin.
Welcome.
I'm sure, Simon, they did something real off for you to feel this way... But when it comes to your partners -- or your kid -- things will always be off for you unless you set it straight. Maybe this thing happened to you just to give you that chance.
Nonsense!
Nonsense!
Anybody here who's interested in what Melvin has to say raise their hands.
Hey -- you let him...
You like sad stories -- you want mine.
... my father didn't leave his room for 11 years -- he hit my hand with a yardstick if I made a mistake on the piano.
Go ahead, Simon. Your father walked in on you and was yelling and... really, come on.
That's not true. Some of us have great stories... pretty stories that take place at lakes with boats and friends and noodle salad. Just not anybody in this car. But lots of people -- that's their story -- good times and noodle salad... and that's what makes it hard. Not that you had it bad but being that pissed that so many had it
No.
No answer... Maybe we should just drive there tomorrow. Can I have that one?
Yes... sure. I'll take the sofa.
My son was outside playing soccer. I never saw him playing ball. Come on, you guys -- take me out for a good time... Take me out dancing.
Dancing?
Stop asking everyone.
Just him and that's it. Okay, you can answer -- we've worked it out.
No... I'm not wearing that -- and just in case you were going to ask I'm not going to let you inject me with plaque either.
You promised a nice place -- can't you just... You have these dry cleaned all the time, don't you?
You wanna dance?
I've been thinking about that since you brought it up before.
I've been thinking about that since you brought it up before.
And?
And?
No... ... I don't get this place. They make me buy an outfit but they let you wear a house dress. I don't get it.
No. Wait. What? Why? I didn't mean it. You gotta sit down. You can still give me the dirty look... just sit down and give it to me.
Melvin, pay me a compliment... I need one and quick... You have no idea how much what you said just hurt my feelings.

That monominute somebody gets that you need them they threaten to go away. Never fails.
That monominute somebody gets that you need them they threaten to go away. Never fails.
That's not compliment, Melvin... That's just trying to sound smart so I feel stupid... A compliment is something nice about somebody else... Now or never.
That's not compliment, Melvin... That's just trying to sound smart so I feel stupid... A compliment is something nice about somebody else... Now or never.
Okay.
And mean it...
Can we order first?
Two crab dinners and pitcher of cold beer. Baked or fries?
Fries.
Fries.
One baked -- one fries.
I am so afraid you're about to say something awful...
Don't be pessimistic. It's not your style. Okay... Here I goes... Clearly a mistake. I have this -- what? Ailment... And my doctor -- a shrink... who I used to see all the time... he says 50 or 60 percent of the time a pill can really help. I hate pills. Very dangerous things, pills. "Hate," I am using the word "hate" about pills.

I don't quite get how that's a compliment for me.
That's maybe the best compliment of my life.
Then I've really overshot here 'cause I was aiming at just enough to keep you from walking out.
So how are you doing with those pills? Well, I hopahopahopa.
Takes months to know... They work little by little. Talking like this is exhausting.
Have you ever let a romantic moment make you do something you know is stupid?
Never.
Never.
Here's the trouble with never.
You don't owe me that.
That wasn't payment. When you first came into breakfast, when I saw you -- I thought you were handsome... Then, of course, you spoke... So now that your soft li'l underbelly is all exposed. Tell me, why did you bring me?
Well, ah... that's a personal question.
Tell me even if you're scared. Tell me why you wanted me here. It's okay.
If you ask me... I'll say, "yes."
There are lots of reason... I had a thought that if you had sex with Simon it might...

Sex with Simon?
Sex with Simon?
It's one idea...

That's why you brought me? Look at me! Is that really why you brought me... Like I'm a what and I owe you what?!
That's why you brought me? Look at me! Is that really why you brought me... Like I'm a what and I owe you what?!
I don't know why I brought you -- that idea occurred to me is all... It came out first... Hey, you kiss him -- me... He says he loves you. You two hit it off. But you don't want to... fine... Forget what I said about sex with Simon. It was a mistake.

I'll never forget you said it.
I'll never forget you said it.
It was a mistake.
Sorry, didn't realize she was right there. Did you have sex with her?
To hell with sex.
Nothing like no choice to make you feel at home.
Let me see... Ahh, gorgeous!
Let me see... Ahh, gorgeous!
Do it then. Get the dog picked up. I can't believe you let it stay there.
I don't want to hear that music right now.
What do you mean? You said you liked it.

I don't.

This one has a special meaning.

It's your car but I don't want to hear it. If that means anything.
Here are the keys to my apartment. I'm going to park you in my place while I take Carol home.
I'll take a bus.
I'll take a bus.
I'll take you... why not?
I'll take you... why not?
I don't care what you did for me. I don't think I want to know you anymore -- all you do is make me feel badly about myself. You have my number.
Hello.
Yeah... Well...
Yeah... Well...
How you doing?

I can trust my brain.

That seems like a good choice.

You don't have to answer everything I say. Just listen to me. Okay?
Okay to say something now?
Go ahead.
Go ahead.
I should've danced with you.

Okay. Good-bye.

So long.
What do you want, Melvin?
Were you asleep?

'Cause if you were asleep -- I'm sorry. And you could be grouchy.

It relaxes me... I'd feel better just sitting on the curb in front of your house than anyplace else I can think of or imagine.
Boyfriend?
Oh, come on in and try not to ruin everything by being you.
Oh, come on in and try not to ruin everything by being you.
Maybe we could live without the wise cracks.
It feels a little confined here. Let's take a walk.
See. It's four in the morning. A walk sounds a little screwy to me, if you don't mind.

If you need an excuse, there's a bakery on the corner. There's a shot it'll open soon -- that way we're not screwy -- we're just two people who like warm rolls.

Okay.
I'm feeling... I've been feeling better.
Melvin, even though it may seem that way now -- you don't know me all that well... I'm not the answer for you.
Hey, I've got a great compliment for you.
You know what? I...
You know what? I...
Just let me talk. I'm the only one on the face of the earth who realizes that you're the greatest woman on earth. I'm the only one who appreciates how amazing you are in every single thing you do -- in every single thought you have... in how you are with Spencer -- Spence... ... in how you say what you mean and how
No! It's certainly not. No -- I don't think so. No.
I'm gonna grab you. I didn't mean it to be a question. I'm gonna grab you.
I don't know the last time I've been out of the city... Hey, my arms are tanning. I used to tan great. We gotta stop soon so'se I can check on Spencer.
I'm sorry... I can't hear you. I can't turn my head all the way yet... tell her we can't hear her.
Do you want to know what happened with my parents?
Yes. I really would.
Yes. I really would.
Well...
Well...
No, let me pull over so I can pay full attention.
I don't blame you... This is a monumental first day out... You sad or anything?
No... Nervous. It would be very rough, Carol, if you weren't along.
No... Nervous. It would be very rough, Carol, if you weren't along.
What a nice compliment.
Was this supposed to be your room?
Our room. I don't want to see him and he's not going to come knocking on your door.
Can you not be violent?
I don't think so. You need help with the pants?
I don't think so. You need help with the pants?
No!!!

I'm going to take a big bath and order a big meal.

All right, cut me a break.
We held each other. It was better than sex. What I need he gave me great.
I just love her. How're you doing?
But what about...
I'll take care of myself --
One night with me!
You think you're kidding.
I love you... Let him take you home.
Don't want to. I love you.
What the heck are those for?
No. No. Get Carol.
No. No. Get Carol.

I also regrew my beard... but you're not interested in changes in me... so it's like I always told you... when it comes to people you...

Yes. No.
He's genuinely upsetting, isn't he?
Won't worry about it. You go ahead.
Hey, hey... Haaa... bad but temporary. The nurses say it's much better than you looked three weeks ago... the hand will come back... they're sure...
Jackie, will you hand me the mirror?
So, what's new anyway? How's Verdell?
Your neighbor -- Udall -- is taking care of him.

You are very certain my dog is okay... because you have no idea...
Yes. Your dog is fine, Simon.
I'm sorry that I'm not taking you.
So am I, Frank.
Simon, you've got to get dressed.
What I know is that as long as you keep your work zipped up around me, I don't give a fuck what or where you shove your show. Are we being neighbors for now?
Definitely a package you don't want to open or touch.
Hope you find him. I love that dog.
No touch. No touch. No touch.
You may think you can intimidate the whole world with your attitude, but I grew up in Hell. My grandmother had more attitude. You don't intimidate me.

Police! Police! Fucking crooked police... doughnut-munching morons help me! Assault and battery and you're black.
Shhhh now. I like Simon. I like him enough to batter you unrecognizable if you verbally abuse him or so much as touch his dog again. Meanwhile, I'll try and think how you can make this up to him. I hate doing this. I'm an art dealer. Have a nice day. Party!
You're taking him... yes... you're taking him -- this will clear the books. One night. You want to say "no" to me? Try... because I've never felt as nuts as I do right this second. I almost want you to try saying "no."
I'm not saying nothing to you.
I'm not saying nothing to you.
Thanks for looking after him.
Hey, where are you going? You can't do this. I can't take a dog. Nobody's ever been in here before.
You don't want to mess with me today. I'll figure something else out tomorrow.
How's Verdell doing?
He's a pain in the ass.
Simon's home. I was sort of hoping you could keep the dog until he's had a chance to think and adjust...
It's been five weeks... another few won't kill me.
It's been five weeks... another few won't kill me.
No. He wants him back. He'll be by tomorrow.

Okay by me.
It's not my dog and this Simon seems to have enough on his mind -- but he did throw up twice and his spark is off.
Sure -- take him to the vet.

I did. And his stomach is out of whack. So they need him for a couple of days.

Really nice. Shouldn't that be a good thing... telling someone, 'no thanks required.'
It looks like it really went over. You're sure making the rounds. Simon says you brought him soup last night. I hope he doesn't write you a note.

Think white and get serious.
Take my car -- a convertible. Do you drive?
Like the wind but I'm not doing it.
Okay... so I'll see you tomorrow. Let's not drag this out. We don't enjoy another that much.
If there's some mental health foundation that raises money to help people like you be sure to let me know.

Good evening.
Hi. You have hard shells, right?
Yes, we do... And I can give you a tie and jacket.
What?
What?
They require a tie and jacket but we have some available.
Actually, I don't think so.
Wait here.
Shall I get her for you?
No, it's all right. I'll just watch.
How you doing, great one?
I haven't looked at myself yet. I figured I could tell from your reaction.
No. Please, don't force him.
You little stinker. He's given you everything.
Sorry. What are those cards?
Frank's idea. He thought I should have notes so I did this right... maintained focus, didn't get emotional and tried not to terrify you.

See, he's right. I need the cards. Simon, you're broke.
The medical bill are 61 thousand now. I've spoken to your parents and they didn't hang up or anything -- they just said they would feel strange calling you.
Well, I can't reach them.
Frank loves you. You know that... but I've spoken to him and he feels that -- -- as a businessman, with limited resources...
I'll be able to keep my apartment and studio, won't I?... Just tell me.
Is he dead yet?
No! Would there be any way for you to be willing to walk his dog for him?

Not just today -- Uh, could you do it -- until, until he gets back on his feet?

You're a wonderful man. Two o'clock is a good time. Here's the key in case he's asleep. Open the curtains for him, so he sees God's beautiful work and knows that even things like this happen for the best.

Where'd they teach you to talk like this -- some Panama City "Sailor want to hump-hump bar"? Or was today getaway day and your last shot at his whiskey. Sell crazy some place else -- we're all stocked up here.
Okay. So you call 911 and don't leave your name -- even a dumb geezer should know that emergency automatically pulls up your name. How come you make a mistake like that?
How come you're pretending to do cop work -- 'cause I don't think you could find your ass if you were spotted the hole.

Mr. Udall... excuse me. Hey there! Have you seen Verdell?
What's he look like?
My dog... you know... I mean my little dog with the adorable face... Don't you know what my dog looks like?
I got it. You're talking about your dog. I thought that was the name of the colored man I've been seeing in the hall.
Which color was that?
Like thick molasses, with one of those wide noses perfect for smelling trouble and prison food...
Frank Sachs -- Melvin Udall.
How're you doing?
How're you doing?
Franks shows my work, Mr. Udall. I think you know that.
Mr. Udall, I'd like to talk to you please.
'Love was... '
Yeeeess!!!
Maybe this can wait.
I found Verdell, Mr. Udall.
Well, that's a load off.
Did you... do something to him?
Do you realize that I work at him?

Well, I work all the time. So never, never again interrupt me. Okay? I mean, never. Not 30 years from now... not if there's fire. Not even if you hear a thud from inside my home and a week later there's a smell from in there that can only come from a decaying body and you have to hold a hanky against your face

Yes. It's not a subtle point you're making.
Okay, then.
That's some face they left hanging on you. You look like...
Could you take it just a little easy, Mr. Udall?
Thank you. Verdell... sweetheart? By the way, thanks for saving me.
I called. I never touched you. I didn't leave my name or nothing.
I called. I never touched you. I didn't leave my name or nothing.
Verdell?
Maybe I'll bring him some food by.
Thank you for walking him.
If you'll excuse me I'm not feeling so well.

No need to stop being a lady... quit worrying -- you'll be back on your knees in no time.
Well, I'll do one thing for you that might cheer you up.
Get out.
Get out.
Don't piss on a gift, tough guy. You want to know why the dog prefers me... it's not affection. It's a trick.
I carry bacon in my pocket.
Oh, my gosh.
Oh, my gosh.
Now we'll both call him.
Now we'll both call him.
Come on, sweetheart...
Come on, sweetheart...
Yo, yo, yo...
Would you leave now, please?
Stupid dog. I don't get it.
I brought you Chinese soup.
Thanks.

I have never been so tired in my life. Okay, if I sit here?
I have never been so tired in my life. Okay, if I sit here?
Got any easier questions?
I haven't been sleeping. I haven't been clear or felt like myself. I'm in trouble. Some son of a bitch is burning my bridges behind my back... But the tiredness -- boy... Not just sleepy.
But sick -- nauseous -- where everything looks distorted and everything inside just aches -- when you can barely get up the will to complain.
But sick -- nauseous -- where everything looks distorted and everything inside just aches -- when you can barely get up the will to complain.
Yeah...
I, uh... I was... attacked. Walked in on people robbing me. I was hospitalized. I almost died.
Let's do the small talk in the car. Load up.
That's very thoughtful.
Never a break. Never.
Well, I always painted. Always. And my mother always encouraged it. She was sort of fabulous about it actually... and she used to... I was too young to think there was anything at all wrong with it... and she was very natural. She used to pose nude for me... and I thought or assumed my father was aware of it.
This stuff is pointless.
Not it at all, really.
Not at all, huh?!... Let's go to the hotel. And if you're lucky tomorrow Dad will give you another wad of sweaty money.
Do you ever get an erection for a woman?
Melvin...
Melvin...
Wouldn't your lie be a lot easier if you were not...
Wouldn't your lie be a lot easier if you were not...
You consider your life easy.
You consider your life easy.
I give you that one... Nice packing.
I get why you're angry. It's no snap to explain why I was like that, but let's not try to do it on the run...
... so Mom. Truly no grudges -- truly. A little odd that you didn't come to see me when you heard I was hurt, but the important thing I want you to know is your son is happy. I'm working again. I'll make do -- I don't want a thing. Wouldn't take it if it was offered. I'll drop you a note from wherever
... Now he's going to want to stay. And they'll want to take a ride to the lake or whatever. So it's a good five hours back. It gives us a chance to take it easy and...
I'm going back with you.
What are you talking about? You got real problems.
I know. I'm a little bit nervous. Suddenly everything seems so easy. Carol, a load has been lifted.
Good-bye. Well, your luck is holding. They sublet your place. You're homeless. Frank's got a line on another place you can use for now.
Another place where?
Another place where?
Does it matter?
I told you to go on in.
Look, I've got to get a hold of Frank and see where I'm hanging my hat 'cause...
I think you gotta camp it here...
What are you talking about?
Thank you, Melvin. You overwhelm me.
They did a nice job... Cozy, huh?
They did a nice job... Cozy, huh?
I love you.
Sorry, didn't know you were awake. I just thought Verdell shouldn't get too used to sleeping in here 'cause then...
Look, we both want the dog -- and...
You going to come talk to me or not?
I'm coming.
What did she say?
I'm a great guy -- "extraordinary"... ... and she doesn't want contact with me. I'm dying here.
I'm a great guy -- "extraordinary"... ... and she doesn't want contact with me. I'm dying here.
Because... ... you love her?
Because... ... you love her?
No... and you're supposed to be sensitive and sharp.
No... and you're supposed to be sensitive and sharp.
Okay... you tell me why -- "You're dying here."
Okay... you tell me why -- "You're dying here."
I don't know... Let me sleep on it and figure it out. Because I'm stuck! Can't go back to what I had... She's evicted me from my life.

Did you like it that much?
Did you like it that much?
It was better than this... Look, you, I'm very intelligent. If you're going to give me advice or conversation or consolation or hope, you got to be better than you're doing. If you can't be at least momentarily interesting than shut the hell up. I'm drowning and you're describing water.

But you know where you're lucky?
But you know where you're lucky?
Absolutely not.
Absolutely not.
You know who you want. I'll take your seat any day. So do something... don't sleep on it... go over there. I don't think anybody should ever sleep on anything -- it's not always good to let things calm down.

Hey... I'm charged here. But she might kill me for showing up this late.
Then get in your jammies and I'll read you a story... I think you've got a chance. The only real enemy you have is her ability to think logically -- the best thing you have going for you is your willingness to humiliate yourself if it gives you one chance in whatever -- so go catch her off- guard.

Okay. Thanks a lot. Here I go.
What's wrong?
I forgot to lock the door.
I can't resist. You usually move through here so quickly and I have so many questions I want to ask you. You have no idea what your work means to me.
What's it mean?
What's it mean?
That somebody out there knows what it's like to be... in here.
That somebody out there knows what it's like to be... in here.
Oh God, this is like a nightmare.
Oh God, this is like a nightmare.
Aw come on, just a couple of questions -- how hard is that?
How do you write women so well?
I think of a man and take away reason and accountability.
Exactly what is your previous experience?
How about that pose? This is not fun... Give me some direction.
Nothing. I just watch till something strikes me. Do anything you think of -- try different thing. Until I say, "hold that pose." Then just try and comfortably hold it.
The fact that you haven't said, "hold it" means I haven't done it right... is that correct? I haven't done it right?
The fact that you haven't said, "hold it" means I haven't done it right... is that correct? I haven't done it right?
No... Okay. What I do is watch and wait for, um... You ever watch someone who doesn't know you're watching... an old woman on a bus, kids going to school and you see this flash come over them and you know immediately that it has nothing to do with anything external -- that it's in respond to a private thought they just had? They
So you're practically finished, huh?
Yes... well, there's one more stage -- trying to figure out if it's any good.
Wait -- I want to see the painting.
Just a second -- he has to go.
Just a second -- he has to go.
Please!! NO!!!
Why are you doing this?
No. No. No. Hey, that painting in there... I just want to tell you...
Is there a problem?
No. No problem. The airport, right?

Right.
Yeah. Yeah, I'm a waiter.

I know just what you mean. I'm pretty beat myself.
Why? What happened?
Didn't you here all them sirens? It's been all over the radio. Some guy shot Leevio Valli, and a bunch of bystanders, in the Trattoria Roma.
Didn't you here all them sirens? It's been all over the radio. Some guy shot Leevio Valli, and a bunch of bystanders, in the Trattoria Roma.
No shit.
No shit.
Yeah, it's terrible. I mean Valli, and I don't care what office he's running for, the guy's a crook. He probably had it coming, but all the other people. Real sad.
Yeah, it's terrible. I mean Valli, and I don't care what office he's running for, the guy's a crook. He probably had it coming, but all the other people. Real sad.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But they caught the guy. I heard it all. Sounded like he just went berserk, fucking loco. Shooting anybody. Drugs, probably.

I'd love to sit in that jury. Send that S.O.B. right to the chair.
What are you doing?
What?

That was Peterson back there. That goes to the expressway for the airport.

Yeah well, you just blew your tip, pal.

What? You think I'm running you up?

Just do your job.
What are you doing?
Get out. You think I'm running you up? Get out.
Get out. You think I'm running you up? Get out.
You can't --
You can't --
The hell I can't. It's my cab. I don't like you. So, get the hell out!
Sit back. Put your seatbelt on.
No fucking way.
No fucking way.
Okay, don't.
Boy, that's fucking genius. You're a fucking genius. Then you're just sitting there, bullshitting with me. Man, no way I coulda done that!
What's your name? We both know it's not Nicholai.
What's your name? We both know it's not Nicholai.
Holy shit! Robert Rath wants to know my name.
Bain. Michael Bain.
How long have you been freelance?
How long have you been freelance?
Two years. Two long fucking years.
Hey. What I don't get was why didn't you take the shot inside the restaurant? I mean you had me, a free shot. That's what I would have done.
It's just a shoot-out then. Sixty- forty, at best. Not my odds.
It's just a shoot-out then. Sixty- forty, at best. Not my odds.
Sounds like chickenshit --
You don't have to tell me that. It's just, I know my bid was low, but was it too low? I mean, did I seem like an amateur, like I didn't know what I was doing?
We both know what you were doing.
Oh! I got a question. Jesus, this has been driving me crazy for years -- shit, listen to me. I sound like some fucking fanboy. I'm sorry, but I just got to ask you. Everybody talks about how you left the Agency and got into the business and then how you went after the Russian, Nicholai Talinkov --
Tachlinkov.
Tachlinkov.
Yeah, that's it. And he's like a fucking genius. They said he shaded you over and over. And in the end, he aced you again. Shaded and faded. They say he's living on some Greek island, but I say that's fucking bullshit. I say you're the best and that you planted his ass. Am I right?
Robert Bain, driving me! Jesus fucking Christ!
After those cops, you'll never be able to come back to Cleveland.
After those cops, you'll never be able to come back to Cleveland.
Who the fuck cares about Cleveland. Cleveland blows. What kind of marks have they got here? Greasy mobster, teamster or some hand job politician. I want the money marks. I want the marks that you get.
So what happens now?
We go around once.
We go around once.
Bullshit.
Okay.
What? What's okay?
What are you doing?
There's a sand barricade up ahead; I'm going to ram this cab into it. The cab has an airbag, odds are good I'll survive. But with this steel casing and bullet proof glass, odds for you are not so good.
No, no. Wait. You don't want me to jump. You're going to jump. I'm stuck back here until it's too late. Wham -- over!
I know you're going to jump.
How'd you know? Just tell me that. How'd you fucking know?
I knew the same way in ten years you're going to know.
I knew the same way in ten years you're going to know.
What does that fucking mean?
What does that fucking mean?
It means that I'm going to tell you things, even though I already know that you're not going to listen to a God damned thing I say.
Listen to me, Bain. Two days ago, you contacted your contractor, who told you that they knew when and where I was going to pick up the transferred money from MicroCell. You don't know how they got the information. It bothered you, but you didn't care. How do I know this? Because ten years ago, I was sitting in that chair, as scared shitless
I ain't scared of you.
I ain't scared of you.
Yeah you are and you hate it. You hate the fact that your hand is shaking and mine isn't. That you're sweating your balls off and I'm not. You've got fear and hate in your belly like battery acid, all because of me.
Yeah you are and you hate it. You hate the fact that your hand is shaking and mine isn't. That you're sweating your balls off and I'm not. You've got fear and hate in your belly like battery acid, all because of me.
If you think you can take me, quit fucking bullshitting and try it.
If you think you can take me, quit fucking bullshitting and try it.
All right, Bain. Pay attention, because this is where everything changes.
Five million dollars?
That's right.
That's right.
Shit. That sure is a lot of money.
Did you see how I did that? Magic wasn't it?
What?
What?
You understand what's going on? It makes sense, right?
You understand what's going on? It makes sense, right?
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
What I just said, no assassin would say. What I've said, only a mark would say.
You think I would be an idiot to pass up five million dollars.
You would be.
You would be.
You don't know a fucking thing about me. You don't have the slightest fucking clue.
You don't know a fucking thing about me. You don't have the slightest fucking clue.
Why don't you tell me.
Why don't you tell me.
I'll tell you this. After Cleveland, I thought I was lucky to be alive. But now, here, I just realized that you were the lucky one.
I'll tell you this. After Cleveland, I thought I was lucky to be alive. But now, here, I just realized that you were the lucky one.
Now I'll tell you something. It wouldn't fucking matter if I offered you one hundred million dollars. You'd still be thinking the same thing, that you're going to take me. And here I am, sitting through this, knowing it's bullshit, looking at you and the only thing going on in my mind, the only thing I can think is that, in just a few
Game over, bitch!
Bain!
I'm on the scent.
You're too late.
Michael?
No. No. No. I don't believe it.
No. No. No. I don't believe it.
They money will be standard bank transfer. We believe we will know where and when.
They money will be standard bank transfer. We believe we will know where and when.
What?
Such language in front of a lady.
I don't give a fuck what you are. I asked you --
How in the fuck do you know that?
Do you want Rath or not?
Hi. Up ahead my boss is in that black limo. We're not sure which hotel we're at, so could you just follow them?
Sure.
Good afternoon. We have reservations at the Hotel Paraiso in Costa Blanca.
Yes, sir.
No, no. I said the Hotel Paraiso.
Yes. This is the Hotel Paraiso.
Yes. This is the Hotel Paraiso.
No, the other Hotel Paraiso, in the city. Near the Plaza del Sol.

Take us there.
Where have you been, Robert?
Sick. The flu.
Sick. The flu.
I don't believe you.
Send the file. I'll have the estimate tonight.
I'm worried about you, Robert.
What?
The contract was stolen.
Who?
A new player. He's using the name Nicholai.
How did he know?
Know what?
Know what?
The fucking contract! How in the fuck did he know.
I don't know what the fuck you are.
I know. It was a joke.
Deadline?
Tomorrow. The buyer is Japanese. His retirement a condition of the bonus.
Who is the mark?
Freelancer. A woman. Surveillance specialist.
Hello, Robert.
The contract?
The contract?
Paid in full.
I have been sitting on a contract from Cleveland for six days because of you.
Fuck you, fuck Cleveland, and fuck your contracts --
I know what happened.
I bet you fucking know!
I bet you fucking know!
It cost us.
I give a fuck? I'm done! I quit! Do you fucking hear me! I'm fucking gone!
He stole another contract.
Is this how it went, Nick?
Robert? Robert?
You think this is a fucking joke?
$1,000,000.
A player?
We have an M.O... Her system is protected by her 'pussy virus.'
What?
He has to clean up. How many bodies were there?
He has to clean up. How many bodies were there?
Um, five.
Um, five.
One hour per man.
Get on the expressway.
Where are we going?
Nikita? She helped me find you.
What? How did you know I had a cat?
What? How did you know I had a cat?
Took a guess. Lucky for you, I guessed right.

Who the fuck are you? Who do you work for?

I work for the government.

Yeah.
Yeah.
You're one of them, aren't you? A fucking pro.
You're one of them, aren't you? A fucking pro.
I'm part of the game, just like you.
Twenty large? That's all?
What do you mean, 'that's all'? What in the hell do you know?
What do you mean, 'that's all'? What in the hell do you know?
The bonus on the contract for you was one million dollars.
I figure that means these are worth ten times that, maybe more.
Ten million --
Ten million --
Now you understand why I'm here.
Now what?
Turn off the engine.
You want me to pump?
No, stay in the car. I want you to understand something. If I intended to kill you, you would already be dead.
Okay. How did you find me?
You're the computer hacker, you tell me.
You're the computer hacker, you tell me.
You didn't know anything about me.
Nikita?
Yellow Pages. V for veterinarian. There aren't that many.
You're one of them, aren't you?
'Them'?
'Them'?
An assassin?
An assassin?
Until a minute ago.
Until a minute ago.
What does that mean?

If I still was what I used to be, you would not be pointing that at me.
Who is that other guy?
Another contractor.
Another contractor.
Someone hired both of you?

No. They hired Bain. The contract would have been mine, but Bain took it from me as he took the previous one.

Forget it!
Forget it!
We don't have a choice.
Don't tell me I don't have a choice!
Right.
Right.
I'm two seconds away from making my choice which means you've got two seconds to tell me why I shouldn't shoot you.

It's simple. You need me. I need you. And we will both need money.

I don't need you to get the money -- my money!
I don't need you to get the money -- my money!
If it hadn't been for me, you would be dead.
I don't need the money.
This is something that is never going to end. You can never work in the business again with this contract, because he will find you. To survive, you have to go into deep hiding. And that's going to take money, a lot of money.

You don't know that -- you're trying to scare me.
You don't know that -- you're trying to scare me.
No. It's the truth. I know what you are. Like me, like Bain, you're a ghost, you're not part of the real world. You don't have a social security number. You don't pay taxes. You've probably used ten different names over the last ten years. A long time ago something probably happened, something illegal and you ran, you disappeared and it was easy. You

How?
How?
Right now, as we sit here, he is tearing through your apartment. He is digging through your drawers, emptying your closets. He will take your telephone and address books, your appointment books. If you keep a diary, he is reading it. He'll go into the kitchen and find out what kind of food you eat, liquor you drink, cigarettes you smoke. In the bathroom
Oh Jesus Jesus...
He will know everything about you. Everything. I know, because I've done it. Once you've been inside a mark's home, you're in their head. If you're any good, you'll find the mark in a week, and Bain is good because I was the best and I couldn't take him.
Listen -- I don't even know your name.

What I'm trying to say is that -- I'm not sure I can do this, help you, unless I know more about you.
What do you want to know?

If Bain hadn't taken the contract on me, would you have?
No.
Why?
Why?
Because I'm done.
Because I'm done.
This is crazy. I can't trust you. You can't trust me. How can we possibly help each other?
With computers.
It's not the same, is it?
It's not the same, is it?
Better than playing with yourself.
Had?
He was Russian. Nicholai Tachlinkov. A legend in the business when I was just starting. I admired him. When I heard he loved chess I became obsessed with the game.
It looks like white's game.
We played with a code using <u>The New</u> <u>York Times</u> obituaries. Over three years we played twelve matches. I never won.

The only thing different about the private sector is that a General Contractor takes less of a percentage than the government, so you make more money. Then once you make the transition, you realize you were never working for the government; it was always the private sector, the vested interests and it's the same vested interests that continue to buy your plane tickets.
