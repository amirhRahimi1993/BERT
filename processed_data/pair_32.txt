How's astronaut training?
Why? You going to give me hard time like the others?
Why? You going to give me hard time like the others?
No. I'm just being friendly.
No. I'm just being friendly.
Good...It's going good.
Whatever made you want to do a tour down here?
I need electrical field experience on my resume. Everything helps... Why are you here?
I need electrical field experience on my resume. Everything helps... Why are you here?
Everybody in corporate training serves a tour on the line. Sup- posed to hone leadership skills or something.
Everybody in corporate training serves a tour on the line. Sup- posed to hone leadership skills or something.
Has it helped?
You think I should hang around more with the crew?
Well, I always heard you don't "learn" leadership, you earn it. How did you know they'd get into the vodka?
I guess I figured if I was in their shoes that's what I would've done.
Maybe you're more one of us than you think...sir.
What can we do?
Our only chance is to lure it to the Swamp and flush it like we did the other.
Shit! He sent them all.
The escape bubbles?
They know, don't they?
Yeah...I think they're just deciding what to do with us.
Yeah...I think they're just deciding what to do with us.
Maybe they already have.
What are you doing?
Seeing how my stock's doing...
We're on backup air.
How much time does that give us?
How much time does that give us?
Less than an hour. It's ruptured an air duct.
Less than an hour. It's ruptured an air duct.
Can't we fix it?
We made it!
Where's Jones?
It hit me! Where are they?!
I can't see them!
The internal monitors read normal.
Where's Doc?!
Where's Doc?!
He's not at his station.
What about our quota?
You're only twenty-five tons off quota. Barring an unforeseen problem you should reach it easily on the last day. It's just a day off. You don't have to take it, I just thought it might help.
Something wrong, Cobb?
Uh..Excuse me sir, it's the air recirculating system, sir...
Uh..Excuse me sir, it's the air recirculating system, sir...
What's wrong with it?
What's wrong with it?
...I'd really have to show it to you.
...I'd really have to show it to you.
All right...
Excuse me, sir...
Is this a contract violation, Mr. Cobb?
Is this a contract violation, Mr. Cobb?
No sir...I just wanted to know if you needed a hand?
Shut up, all of you.
Mr. Beck, the contract states that no body can be disposed of without authorization of---
No!
It bit me!
Oh, God, she's out there...
Jones...come with me. Cobb, you and Doc check the rooms.
Charge set?
Charge set. Backing off. C'mon Rover let's get out of here.
I'm going inside.
What's your air reading?
What's your air reading?
Twenty minutes...
Twenty minutes...
Twenty minutes!...Who had tank duty?
Wait till you reach thirty- five before you blow your suit...
Roger.
Give me a readout, DeJesus.
Ahhhh!
How do you feel, DeJesus?
Okay.
Okay.
Better let the Doc take a look at you, after dinner.
Okay, number 23's full.
Let's get it out of here and bring in a new one.
I can't tell you much about it, except that none of you show any symptoms.
And it killed Bo?
And it killed Bo?
No...she killed herself.
Two hundred and fifty-two tons of Magnesium and 15 tons of Sodium.
Sounds like a good week, Beck. In fact...I put your folder in front of the Vice President of District Operations last night...
Thank you, Martin.
Don't thank me, yet, but it is important to know where you're going and who your friends are... 'Know what I mean?
...as long as you know it's not in your contract.
I know that.
I know that.
Well, suit yourself, then...its your decision... Ha ha...a little joke...suit yourself...
How's the weather for pickup tomorrow?
Beautiful.
Well, according to Maritime law, you, as commander of the Shack have the authority to dispose of the body. However, the company doesn't want you to do that.
What you don't understand is that my crew is in jeopardy.
What you don't understand is that my crew is in jeopardy.
But you don't have any proof at this point to assume that this disease is contagious, do you?
But you don't have any proof at this point to assume that this disease is contagious, do you?
I'm not anxious to find out, either.
I'm not anxious to find out, either.
Beck, trust me. If the company felt that you or your crew were in any danger we would authorize an immediate emergency pickup. We could be there in a few hours.
Beck, trust me. If the company felt that you or your crew were in any danger we would authorize an immediate emergency pickup. We could be there in a few hours.
Do it.
Do it.
Unfortunately. We can't.
What're you saying? That we're not even going to be picked up tomorrow?
It shouldn't be a long delay.
It shouldn't be a long delay.
But it's a delay! How long? A day? Two days?!
But it's a delay! How long? A day? Two days?!
Twelve hours, no big deal. We should know something first thing in the morning. Don't worry.
Forty-eight hours!
I realize you must have gone through hell--
Made your million, yet?
Not yet.
Not yet.
How's TransOcean doing?
You got money in this tub?
I signed-up for the stock option.
You take your money, too seriously, Bo.
You're damn right I do. Five years down here and I'll pull in more than 15 topside. I'm not down here for the fun, I'll tell you that.
Personal effects...
Timex...
I'm telling you, it's the suits!
Fuck the suits, it's the people monitoring them. It Doc had been there like he's supposed to it never would've happened!
Hey, Bo...when're you going to be off that thing? I want to find out tonight's NBA scores and check the weather.
The weather's good, I already checked, but I'll be off in a minute.
If he had his blinkers on--
It wouldn't make any difference in there...He could be two feet away and on fire and she'd still not see him!
Who else...Sixpack.
The man is unbelievable... I say, leave him in there.
The man is unbelievable... I say, leave him in there.
What about his suit? That's a million five the company's got to replace. They'll make somebody go get it.
Cute, DeJesus...Specimen cups?
Aw, loosen up, Bowman... Hey, Willie, I got one served up for you.
Yes sir...
Hook's on 24...
What the?...
Russian.
You read Russian?
Russian, French, Italian, Spanish, Greek, German, a little Hindu, some Serbo Croat and a smattering of Swahili...standard pre-med background...
Bullshit.
...and a Russian grandmother...
What happened?
It...almost got you.
It...almost got you.
What was it?
Still bothering you?
Itches like hell.
Itches like hell.
Take it off and let me have a look.
No way, Mister Beck! <u>No</u> <u>fucking way</u>! We just did a full shift, you can't call Shack duty on top of a full shift. It's a contract violation!
Whooo! Right on, Cobb! Let's hear it for our shop Steward!
Listen to it for Christsake.
Ah, it's just old, like me. You don't see the Doc opening me up every time I get a new creak in my joints...I say, as long as it's recycling the air let the next shift deal with it. But, 'long as we're here...
So that's all you do?...
Shhhh...don't tell no one. Job security.
Oooooh. Damn! Not so loud. Turn down the music.
What music? There ain't no music.
Yeah? How'd the kid hold up?
Pretty good. He sent them out videotaping outcrop.
"Routine," my ass! Ain't nothin' "routine" about no physical check- up 10,000 feet down...especially when we're getting picked up the next day!
He didn't say it was a "routine check-up," he said it was a "routine <u>precaution</u>."
At least we get time and a half. That's in the contract.
Fuck double pay, man! I want out of here!
What's going on?
It's Hazy...It's got him! Stay here and don't let him out. I'm going to get the Doc.
You let him get away!
I ain't doing nothing for that thing without something to defend myself.
I ain't doing nothing for that thing without something to defend myself.
That <u>thing</u> happens to be my friend.
I say we should go get in the escape bubbles and get the hell out of here!
And hit the surface in the middle of a typhoon?...No, thank you. I'll take my chance down here.
Hey, man, you know that in Switzerland--and this country's the size of East L.A., okay?--they speak 54 different dialects? Fifty-four!
Who cares?
Who cares?
I do, man. That's a beautiful place. When I get out of here I'm going there. Find a nice little snow covered chalet, warm little woman, crackling fire--
Hey, Cobb...Man, why don't you take off your shirt and pants, man? You should do that wearing what you're going to wear at the beach.
This is what I wear at the beach, goddamnit.
You guys are crazy. What the hell you play that stupid game for?
What game, Cobb?...I'm on my way to Nirvana...
What game, Cobb?...I'm on my way to Nirvana...
You're on your way somewhere all right...the looney bin.
You're on your way somewhere all right...the looney bin.
I'm on the way to the looney bin? Hey, man, I'm not the dude sun bathing in his clothes.
Bad as he is there's no way we can make our quota with- out his sad self out there. You just can't do it.
He's tanking on us...
C'mon, Cobb...you're slacking...
I ain't, goddamnit...It's Jones!..
Hey!...I feel something. It's moving! He's alive!
I feel it, too...Someone's trying to get out.
It's Sixpack!
I'm going to kill it!
Burritos...Enchiladas...
Oh, gag, man, how can you eat that stuff?...
Typhoon?!
Twelve hours!
Serves his ass right to get it. Motherfucker brings that shit onboard. I hope his fucking ass rots in the sea and is shit upon by the fish.
'Fucker could have gotten us all killed.
How'd you do that?
What? That?...I've done this one before. You hungry? I'm hungry.
Getting some food.
Under there?
Look. Water.
Probably the plumbing. You gonna make me finish that puzzle by myself, or what?
How far away is she?
Two hundred meters.
Excuse me, sir...Bowman's sick. She's downstairs in the infirmary.
The infirmary?...
The infirmary?...
Yes sir, ain't that where we usually go when we're sick?
Yes sir, ain't that where we usually go when we're sick?
We're simply concerned about her...proximity to...
We've got to get him to the infirmary.
What are you going to do to him?
What are you going to do to him?
I'm going to try to remove it.
I'm going to try to remove it.
I've got Cobbie downstairs watching the door.
Bigger than DeJesus? How?
It's had a meal.
It would explain the suction- like appendages.
Like a leech.
The monster appears to be a genetic aberration...
No fuckin' lie...
No fuckin' lie...
...It has many traits of deep sea marine life...regeneration, scales, gills, even a period of dormancy... but the fact that it remembered where the plasma was stored, or where the communication wiring was, may imply that it has some other quality...
Fuck semantics, Doc! You saying its like part DeJesus, part Sixpack, part Bowman?!
I don't know. I'm guessing.
Clear for pickup.
Let's hope it holds.
Hey, Jonesy, who's the best power forward in the NBA...Jameson?
Jameson? Who're you trying to con?
What is it?
"Debbie Does Dallas"... Hell, it's in Russian. I can't read it...
No...he's really sick. I heard him last night. The company will take that into consideration...
Honey, the company don't give a flying fuck about "whys," they just look at the numbers and the contract says if we miss our quota they only got to pay us half-pay for the entire month.
Who were you talking to?
Sixpack...
Sixpack...
How is he?
How is he?
Sleeping. No sign of Doc, though. I'll check the control room. You look in the shower room...
What on earth's the matter with you?
I ought to smack your face!
What's wrong?
DeJesus...It's got him.
It needs blood?
Fucking great...You telling me we got a fucking dracula in here with us?
Cobb's cut...It was in him! It got Doc...
Oh man, that's just great...
What is it?
The good doctor signed our death warrant.
What is it?
The air's stopped.
The shack...
She's wondering what's happening. We're losing air faster than I thought.
Don't spend all day down there.
Don't fuckin' worry, I ain't.
Are you sure you saw something?
How many times I got to tell you. I saw a ship.
How many times I got to tell you. I saw a ship.
Well, why haven't they answered our flares?
Are you okay, Jonesy?
Tip top, Willie...tip top.
Tip top, Willie...tip top.
Who's the best power forward in the NBA...Jameson?
Who's the best power forward in the NBA...Jameson?
Jameson? Who are you trying to con...?
It saw us!
Answer them and quit kicking me!
Answer them and quit kicking me!
I'm not touching you!
My pocket. Check my pocket, will ya, honey?
Your pocket?
Your pocket?
The latch is screwed up. Or the hinge.
The latch is screwed up. Or the hinge.
Right.
Bitch! Look what you did!
Sorry, darling...Just thought a little humor would loosen us all up...you know?...
What's wrong, did you miss me?
Hardly.
Hardly.
Don't worry, darlin, I'm...
Soap is called Soap because he likes to keep his hands clean of any unlawful behaviour. He is proud of his job, and even more proud that it's legal.
He's a stroppy sod but he's got more balls than a golfer, only he doesn't know it. ' * Cut from completed film.
I'll kill him!
Stop fucking around, Tom, and think. What are we going to do?
So how long do you have to wait 'till you see a return?
Probably no longer than four weeks.
Probably no longer than four weeks.
A month? So, my friend, what fucking good is that, if we need it in six . . . no, five days?
A month? So, my friend, what fucking good is that, if we need it in six . . . no, five days?
Well, it's still a good idea.
How much did you part with?
Seven hundred for the pair.
Is there something we should know about you, Soap?
I am not sure what's more worrying, the job or your past.
A what?
A traffic warden. Look, what's this?
I wanted to talk to you about that.
Well, talk.
Well, talk.
Well not exactly, no; I got 'em sitting in the car, actually; I thought we might sell them back to the Greek, but I am having a bit of a problem getting hold of him.
When the old bastard is not playing cards he's chasing a thousand debts that ill-fated individuals owe for an array of reasons.
Sex and sleaze and antique shotguns are all deep and dear in Harry's stone cold heart.
The odds are one hundred to one so all we need is five grand.
I would rather put my money on a three-legged rocking horse. The odds are a hundred to one for a good reason, BACON . . . it won't win. So where is Ed with all the bright ideas?

At the bottom of a bottle and has been for two days; it's hit him hard.
At the bottom of a bottle and has been for two days; it's hit him hard.
It's hit us all hard!
It's hit us all hard!
Yeah, but he has got to tell his Dad he is about to lose his bar.
Drachmas, I hope. I would feel safer with a chicken drumstick. They could do more harm than good.
Jesus, Tom, do they work?
Ed can run fast, talk fast, eat fast, and play cards fast, but he's fucking slow when it comes to spotting the roz.
The reason he is called BACON is he spent so much of his youth in the police station that people thought he was one of them. But he is a big boy now and it is time to move on.
Hatchet has a colleague, a monster of a man: Barry the Baptist.
The Baptist got his name from drowning people for Hatchet.
Twenty-five from me, Tom, Soap and yourself; a hundred grand to the pound. You don't need to count it.
I still will, if you don't mind.
Because it's cheap like a budgie.
And nobody wants to live next door to the people that we live next to; a bit anti-social, you know.
Let me tell you about Hatchet Harry. Once there was this geezer called Smithy Robinson who worked for Harry. It was rumoured that he was on the take. Harry invited Smithy round for an explanation. Smithy didn't do a very good job. Within a minute Harry lost his temper and reached for the nearest thing at hand, which happened to be a fifteen-inch black
I'll think of something, don't worry.
I don't know how you've reached that conclusion.
They can't report they have had all their drugs and money nicked, can they?
Yes?
It's happening tomorrow morning. Get back here now.
Of course you will, sweetheart. This one, search this one. Ed finds the keys without any trouble.
I'll meet you in the van when you have finished with handsome there.
Bacon, see what we got.
Let's have a butcher's. Jesus, there's lots of everything. We've got god knows how much of this stinking weed; we've got a shit load of cash; and we've got a . . . traffic warden.
I think he's still alive. He's got claret coming out of him somewhere. What did they want with a traffic warden?
I dunno, but I don't think we need him. Dump him at the lights.
Scarface, I have watched Scarface. You want to know how to do a drug deal, you watch Scarface!
That inspires confidence, that does.
He'll care all right. That was going to be his money. Whether he cares about us is different. Pass your phone.
Think about what you're going to say, Ed; we are on thin ice.
Well?
Well what?
The traffic warden went to the morgue and recognized Dog and his lot so that put us sort of in the clear. They got no case against us because there is no evidence against us.
Apart from those shotguns.
Apart from those shotguns.
And Tom took care of them.
What's that?
A cocktail, you asked for a cocktail.
A cocktail, you asked for a cocktail.
No, I asked you to give me a refreshing drink. I wasn't expecting a fucking rainforest; you could fall in love with an orang-utan in that.
No, I asked you to give me a refreshing drink. I wasn't expecting a fucking rainforest; you could fall in love with an orang-utan in that.
You want a pint, go to the pub.
You want a pint, go to the pub.
I thought this was a pub.

It's a Samoan pub.

Well whatever it is, could you get your man to turn the TV down?
Well whatever it is, could you get your man to turn the TV down?
You ask him if you like, but I would leave him to it if I was you.
Like what?
Like antiques.
Like antiques.
Antiques? What the fuck do we know about antiques? We rob post offices and steal cars, what the fuck do we know about antiques?
Antiques? What the fuck do we know about antiques? We rob post offices and steal cars, what the fuck do we know about antiques?
If it looks old, it's worth money, simple. So stop fucking moaning and rob the place.
I thought you said no staff, Bazza!
You get the guns?
You get the guns?
You should see what they did to poor Gary.
Next time we do a job like this we gonna want more money, or we are going back to post offices and cars.
Where're the others?
There are no others.
Now, stop fucking around. The others, the old ones?
Now, stop fucking around. The others, the old ones?
I don't know what you mean.
I don't know what you mean.
There were two old guns there; where are they?
There were two old guns there; where are they?
Not in the cabinet there wasn't. There was a couple of old hammer-lock muskets the butler was carrying; they were ours, and we sold 'em!
Well you just better un-sell 'em, sharpish.
They were . . .
They were . . .
I am not fucking interested.
You fucking well have to get 'em!
We made a deal for everything inside the cabinet.

Inside, out-fuckin'-side. I don't give a shit, you get those guns because if you don't . . .
Inside, out-fuckin'-side. I don't give a shit, you get those guns because if you don't . . .
Yeah, Bazza, what?
Yeah, Bazza, what?
You heard of Harry Lonsdale? Otherwise known as Back-you-up with-a- Hatchet Harry, infamous for his removal of digits?
All right, all right, so we can say he is good.
Better than good, he is a fucking liability.
Better than good, he is a fucking liability.
Where did he get a hundred grand?
And JD is his dad, and owns the whole property?
No mortgage, no debts; lock, stock, the sodding lot . . . don't worry, I got it under control.
No mortgage, no debts; lock, stock, the sodding lot . . . don't worry, I got it under control.
Good, you can get this under control now.
Er, very nice Harry. What's it for?
Don't play innocent with me Bazza; spanking!
Shotguns? What, like guns that fire shot?
Oh, you must be the brains then. That's right, guns that fire shot . . . Make sure you bring everything from inside the gun cabinet. There will be a load of guns, that's all I want. I'll pay you when you deliver. Everything outside the cabinet you can keep; it's yours.

Oh, thanks very much. And there had better be something there for us.
Oh, thanks very much. And there had better be something there for us.
It's a fucking stately home, of course there'll be something there.
So who's the Guv? Who we doing this for?
You're doing it for me is all you need to know. You only know that because you need to know.
You're doing it for me is all you need to know. You only know that because you need to know.
I see, one of those `on a need to know' basis things, like a James Bond film, is it?

Careful, remember who's giving you this job.
I hate these Southern shites.
Fucking Northern monkeys.

Nope.

Can I help?

I think I can help you, as it happens.
I think I can help you, as it happens.
Yes?
Yes?
I have got something for ya. Well, for your boy, actually.
I have got something for ya. Well, for your boy, actually.
Well, I suggest you speak to him, then.
It's about time you give my young friends a visit, Chris. Tomorrow is the day and mum seems to be the word, and I can't have that now, can I, Chris?
No Harry, you can't.
The boys had 'em. I know you like these things; wondered if you wanted them?
Er, yeah, sure, I'll have 'em.
Have you counted the money?
Yeah, it's all there, to the pound.
Yeah, it's all there, to the pound.
They were going to pay, then?
They were going to pay, then?
It looks like ít, but who knows? The opportunity was there. In my experience it is best to take the opportunity if it is there.
It looks like ít, but who knows? The opportunity was there. In my experience it is best to take the opportunity if it is there.
Good job, Chris.
Mind your language in front of my boy.
Jesus Christ!
Did I say speak? And it's Mr Harry to you . . . Now don't disappoint me and chose your words carefully. You may speak.
I'll have it for Mr Harry in a few days. I have been busy, and I am nearly there.

Son, have a look in his locker.
Son, have a look in his locker.
No chance of you lifting this sunbed up is there?
Hello, John. Nice holiday?
I won't be seeing you again Chris; I have paid him every last penny.
I won't be seeing you again Chris; I have paid him every last penny.
I am sure you have, no one was accusing you of being dishonest, John.
Son?
Made a few quid, did ya? Now where is it?
You all right back there, mate?
Very fucking funny. Where's what I want?
Very fucking funny. Where's what I want?
It's in an office; I have just left it in the office. 137
It's in an office; I have just left it in the office. 137
Well, you had better go and get it from the office. That's if you want to see your son reach his next birthday. Now chop-fuckin'-chop.
Well, you had better go and get it from the office. That's if you want to see your son reach his next birthday. Now chop-fuckin'-chop.
All right, furry muff.
What are you doing?
Well, it's a five minute walk or a thirty second drive.
Well, it's a five minute walk or a thirty second drive.
You had better be careful.
How long has he been in there, son?
About twenty minutes.
About twenty minutes.
Is he on his own?
Is he on his own?
Just carrying a bag.
Just carrying a bag.
Let's have a look, shall we?
It's not him, Dad.
Try that one.
That should take care of that lot. We are now officially in the money- loaning business, all right, son?
All right, Dad.
All right, Dad.
Well, put your seatbelt on then.
Yeah?
That's no way to answer the phone.
That's no way to answer the phone.
Is that you, Dean?
Is that you, Dean?
Sure is.
Sure is.
What can I do for you?
What can I do for you?
You know those shotguns I sold ya, well I need 'em back.
You know those shotguns I sold ya, well I need 'em back.
Not likely I am afraid; I don't think I'll be seeing them again.
Not likely I am afraid; I don't think I'll be seeing them again.
I got the money to pay for 'em.
I got the money to pay for 'em.
I am sure you do, but I don't think you understand; I am not going to see them or the guns again.
OK Gary, we call each other Kenny, all right?
All right, Kenny.
Can't you pull that stocking down further, Kenny?
It just cost me fifty quid to have this done. If you think I am going to ruin it for a couple of old bastards you're mistaken, Kenny.
Who was that?
That was Hatchet Horrible Harry.
That was Hatchet Horrible Harry.
Jesus, I have heard about him.
Jesus, I have heard about him.
We're in the spite. They were his fucking guns that we sold; we gotta find 'em.
We gotta get those guns.
This is dangerous shit, Dean; we don't even know who lives in there.
This is dangerous shit, Dean; we don't even know who lives in there.
Listen, I don't care who lives in there; all as I know it's got to be preferable to death by Hatchet.
Listen, I don't care who lives in there; all as I know it's got to be preferable to death by Hatchet.
Furry muff, let's go.
I want you to search the house for bugs. I mean I want you to strip it.
What is the point in that? Even if it was a bug they would have taken it with 'em.
What is the point in that? Even if it was a bug they would have taken it with 'em.
It is too late for you to start thinking John. It is a possibility and that is good enough for me. And after you strip the house, I want you to get every thieving slag this side of Ceylon and torture them, badly. I want to know who is responsible, otherwise I will hold you responsible.
So we have a bit of a problem, don't we?
Er well, yes we do.
Er well, yes we do.
In fact it is a little more than a bit of a problem, isn't it? You could say that in the scale of these things this is the Mount fucking Everest of problems, couldn't you? . . . And the reason it is such a mon fucking-strosity of a problem is because you don't have the first fucking idea who did this to us,
Dog, I have found the cash!
The stupid bastards! Count it!
The stupid bastards! Count it!
Shit, Dog, there's a lot. Don't you want to do this next door?
Shit, Dog, there's a lot. Don't you want to do this next door?
We're not going next door until we've flayed these dead men walking. Count it out the back. I don't want them seeing you fingering that money as soon as they walk in.

But... Give it us here, you dozy sod. You hide and get the guns ready. Wait until they are well in, then give it to 'em.
So do you know these geezers well?
Well enough. I have been buying gear off one of them for a couple of years.
Well enough. I have been buying gear off one of them for a couple of years.
What they like then?
What they like then?
Poofs. Nothing heavy, four public school guys. Soft as shite.
There's one steel gate as you go in but they never lock it.
What do you mean, never? Well what have they got it for, then?
What do you mean, never? Well what have they got it for, then?
I must have been there fifty times, it's never been locked; they're not suspicious. Everybody who goes there are toffs. They're all into that karma crap: `If I don't harm nobody, nobody harms me' stuff.

Is there no way they can get back to you?
Is there no way they can get back to you?
Even if they could they'd be too shit scared. They have got no muscle; they're gutless faggots.
There's nothing to worry about, it's going to be easy.
There is no such thing as easy in my experience and, if you think this is going to be easy, you're a dick. It may be easier than most but it's not going to be easy.
What's that idiot doing next door? We use your van. It's up some stairs this place, so we'll stick out like balls on a bulldog. Plank is going up first. There is a cage but it is never locked, is it Plank?
No.
No.
And it better bloody not be. Once he is firmly in place, he gets the rest of us in. We'll get nasty with a couple of them, shit 'em up, scare and gag 'em. I can't see these wankers giving us a problem, but they might have a couple of tools hanging around like any cowboy. When the job is done we'll come straight

Just hold on, I got the keys.
What the fuck did you do to Fauntleroy?
I didn't touch him, he just passed out.
It must be this one.
Just give me the keys.
Don't you stags move or I'll kill the lot of ya.
Who are you going to kill Plank? There's no one there.
Yeah, one of them's out.
OK, open the gate.
My neck, Dog. That's the last bag?
How about you? All right?
Willy, this is the last time, and don't let him know that you're here, otherwise he will be here all day, and get rid of him quick. We have work to do.
What the fuck is going on?
J, what's going on out there? Get the rifle out, Charles. We're being fucked.
Get the sodding gate open now, Plank.
Right, his leg's going now.
All right, all fucking right, I am coming. Willie, he doesn't know you are here, just sort something out, OK.
And all your friends, there's a good lad.
There is only three of us here.

Hold on bollocks, no one but card players in here tonight sonny, and I do mean no one.
Are you sure you can afford twenty-five?
Well that depends on how you look at it. I can afford it as long as I see it again, if that's what you mean. You got the rest from the fat man and Bacon?
Well, what do you want us to do about it?
Hit the fuckers.
What was that, armed? What do you mean, armed? Armed with what?
Er, bad breath, colourful language and a feather duster! . . . What do you think they will be armed with? Guns, you tit!
Er, bad breath, colourful language and a feather duster! . . . What do you think they will be armed with? Guns, you tit!
Guns! You never said anything about guns. A minute ago this was the safest job in the world, now it's turning in to a bad day in Bosnia . . .
Guns! You never said anything about guns. A minute ago this was the safest job in the world, now it's turning in to a bad day in Bosnia . . .
Jesus, Soap, stop being such a mincer. I thought about that and...
And we will just have to find out who's going to be carrying them.
Carrying them. They could all be carrying them for what we know.
Carrying them. They could all be carrying them for what we know.
No, just one of them is in charge of them going to the job. So I assume he will still
Where the fuck are they going? To butcher a sheep? I thought this was a robbery.
Where did they get those outfits from? Haven't we got some like that, Tom?
No I fucking don't! You can't make a cup of tea, Edward.
Why not? The whole of the British Empire was built on cups of tea.
Why not? The whole of the British Empire was built on cups of tea.
And look what happened to that.

If you think I am going to war without one, you're mistaken, mate.
That's it all done, we are off.
You think it's a good idea taking it back to yours?
You think it's a good idea taking it back to yours?
There is nowhere else to keep it, and it's the last place they are going to look. Anyway the battle's over and the war is won.
I hope this is the right move.
It's either that, my old boy's place, and we lose a digit daily. I am going to call him.
You what? What are you on about?
Listen, if he has the guns he might have the money . . . I think we should go and see him.
Well, what's going on?
I don't know, but what I do know is that there's no more Harry, which means there's no more debt, and if there's no more debt there's no more problem, and there's no more problem with our neighbours because they are all dead. I think, if I get this right, we haven't done anything wrong anyway, which means we are in the clear.
I don't think we will take the risk for seven hundred quid.
Tom, go and throw those guns off a bridge.
There's nothing in it!
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
I mean it's fucking empty.
Who's this fat man, then?
Bacon, the fat man and myself, and it's time to make a call to Harry.
You see it's not easy to take a seat at this table; the money involved has to be a hundred grand upwards and there is no shortage of punters.
The man who decides if you can play is this man Harry, or Hatchet Harry as some including himself like to call him.
What do you mean?
He means they're thieving dogs.
What the hell are you doing here?
Why, what's up?
Why, what's up?
Er, let me guess, my foot in your arse? A game of cards and Hatchet Harry. You're supposed to be getting some rest, boy!
I dunno, but they look nice. I rather like ' em.
Top of the list of priorities, how nice they look.
Everything all right out there, Tom?
Right as rain.
Right as rain.
Where the hell are we supposed to hide?
Well, what did he say?
He said he thinks we have paid him, and he wants to talk about those guns . . . now.
You and me, Tom.
What do you mean, me?
Tom, this is our case.
. . . What?
. . . What?
This is our money, Tom! . . . Now I think we should go.
Tom, don't mess around, let's go.
I'11 meet you in the car.
I'11 meet you in the car.
Tom?
Tom?
I'll only be a minute.
The only item that connects us with the crime is sitting in your car which is sitting outside?
We paid seven hundred quid for those guns. They could hardly trace them to you, could they?
You got it all?
A hundred grand.
You must be Eddy. JD's son.
Yup, you must be Harry? Sorry, I didn't know your father.
Yup, you must be Harry? Sorry, I didn't know your father.
Never mind son, you just might meet him if you carry on like that.
That is quite a raise, one hundred and fifty on my hundred.
Yes . . . and is there something else you want to say? EDDY
I will.
You will what?
You will what?
I will loan you the money.
I think I would rather just turn them over.
I am not interested in what you would rather; I want to keep going. I am also offering you the money, so we don't have to turn them over because you can borrow.
I am not interested in what you would rather; I want to keep going. I am also offering you the money, so we don't have to turn them over because you can borrow.
I need two hundred and fifty grand.
I need two hundred and fifty grand.
No, you need five hundred grand to see me.
That's if I want to see you.
Well, you're going to have a problem carrying on, aintcha.
I'll see ya.
For half a million?
For half a million?
Unless you are going to accept twenty quid.
Unless you are going to accept twenty quid.
And still got a sense of humour. That's not monkey nuts son; you can still fold. OK, before I loan you this, I expect, if you lose of course, my money back within a week, Crystal? That's Sunday, OK?
That you, boy?
It's Ed, if that's what you mean.
It's Ed, if that's what you mean.
It's pay day, ain't it?
It's pay day, ain't it?
I wanted to talk to you about that.
I wanted to talk to you about that.
I bet you did. I have got half a million nicker sitting in front of me, which means that some poor sod doesn't. You must have upset a few people, boy . . . but that isn't really my concern, is it? But what does concern me is the guns you had. I want to talk to you about that. Get your arse over
Go on.
I like your bar.

Do you want me to draw a picture?

Hello, can I help you?
All right, it's Plank. Is Willie there?

Jesus, if I pick them up, will they stay in one piece? Where did you get them from?

They look nice, I agree . . . but lacking in criminal credibility, aren't they? I might get laughed at. How much do you want for these muskets?
Seven hundred each.
Sawn-offs are out, Tom; people like to have a bit mare range nowadays.
Range? I don't want to blow the arse out of this country, granted, but I don't want anybody blowing a raspberry at me either. I want to look fucking mean.

Tom, you're all heart.

Listen cooky, you want to make sure that man rests before he plays; it's in all our interests.

Chill, Winston, it's me and Charlie can see it's me, so what's the problem?
The problem is, Willy, that Charlie and yourself are not the quickest of cats in the alley at the best of times, so just do as I say and keep the fucking cage locked.
What are you carrying, Willy?
Er, fertilizer.

You went out six hours ago to buy a money counter and you come back carrying two bags of fertilizer. Alarm bells are ringing, Willy.

"Fishbait," says Buddy, in that quiet way of his, "What you know about them tires that went missing from markets?" Fishbait thinks for a minute, then he lifts up a loose board from the porch floor and calls down into it, "C'mon out, Pooter, they caught us!"
Buddy Deeds. He had a way.
Buddy Deeds. He had a way.
He known who it was onnacouna the tire tracks in the dirt from the back of the garage to where they loaded up. "Old Fishbait," he says, "never lifted a thing in this world if there was a way he could roll it."

That's not the whole story. The Mexicans that know, that remember, understand what Buddy was for their people. Hell, it was Mercedes over there who swung the deciding vote for him.
Tell that one, Hollis--
Hell, everybody heard that story a million times.
The two of us were the only deputies back then me and Buddy--it's what-- '58--

And the Sheriff at the time was Big Charley Wade. Charley was one of your old-fashioned bribe-or-bullets kind of Sheriffs, he took a healthy bite out of whatever moved through this county.
"Mas cerveza por favor."
That Buddy was a cool breeze.
Charley Wade were known to have put a good number of people in the ground, and your daddy gets eyeball to eyeball with him.
We made our collection at Roderick's place and that was the last anybody seen hide nor hair of him. He went missing the next day, along with ten thousand dollars in county funds from the safe at the jail.
Your mother was a saint.

Historic occasion, isn't it?
Seems like we have another one every week.

I heard there was a bit of a fuss.
Oh, you know, the usual troublemakers. Danny Padilla from the Sentinel, that crowd.
There was a faction pulling for that boy who was killed in the Gulf War-- Ruben--
--Santiago.
--Santiago.
Right. But nobody here ever noticed him till they read his name on the national news--
That so?
She put it even at three to three, so as the Mayor I get to cast the tiebreaker. The older generation won't have any problem with it. They remember how Buddy come to be Sheriff, that it was all 'cause he took their part.
Never heard from him again?
Not a peep. Buddy run the man out of town.
Oh--he come to an accommodation. Money doesn't always need to change hands to keep the wheels turning.

I think somewhere between Roderick Bledsoe's club and his house, Wade ran into Buddy Deeds. I think Buddy put a bullet in him, waited for him to die, threw him in the trunk of the Sheriff's car and drove him out by the Army post, I think he buried him under four feet of sand and never looked back.
You lived in the man's house what-- seventeen, eighteen years? And you didn't get to know him any better than that?
I got to go see somebody in San Antonio today. Your memory gets any better, I'll be back tonight.

Don't think the Rangers are likely to find out any more than they already have.

I remember him watching me once. When I was little--before you and I--
I was on the playground with all the other kids, but I thought he was only looking at me. I was afraid he was going to arrest me--he had those eyes, you know--
Yeah.
Yeah.
Weird what you remember.
Your boy, there--

Amado.
Nice-looking kid.

He hates me.
He hates me.
No--
No--
With Paloma, it's more like she pities and tolerates me- totally age- appropriate. But Amado--he's--he's never been book-smart. Had a hard time learning to read. Me being a teacher and caring about those things is like an embarrassment--like a betrayal.

So why did you come back here, Sam?
Got divorced, I wasn't gonna work for my father-in-law anymore. The fellas down here said they'd back me--

You don't want to be Sheriff.

I got to admit it's not what I thought it'd be. Back When Buddy had it-- hell, I'm just a jailer. Run a 60- room hotel with bars on the windows.

Billy? This was on Miller's forehead. Any idea what it is?
Nope.
I could have lost my fucking hands.
That would have kept you out of the Magic Circle. Which was presumably the idea. These are about Nix.
That's Butterfield...

We've all of us waited too long to have the homecoming spoiled.
What do you mean, "all of us?"

Oh Christ! Oh Christ!
It's him... it's him.

Did your husband know Quaid?

We wouldn't be having this conversation if I didn't. Swann's one of the most remarkable men alive.
You don't believe me.
He's an illusionist. It's not exactly brain surgery.
Sorry. You asked.

Yes. I think you probably can. We'd need to talk about your fee.
Yes. I think you probably can. We'd need to talk about your fee.
Forget the fee. If I find Butterfield, maybe we'll talk about money. If I don't... ...my gamble. Either way... I get to spend some time... here.
How did it go today?
I went up to the Magic Castle. You were right. He didn't have a lot of fans up there.
They were jealous of him.
Why? Because he had you?
Why? Because he had you?
He... didn't have me.. I told you-

Yes. You do that.
Flesh is a trap. That's what he used to say. Flesh is a trap and magic sets us free. Why did you come back?
I didn't leave. I was just digging around.
What did you find?
Jennifer Desiderio, for one. She threw herself in front of a car this afternoon.
Oh Christ.
Why don't you tell me the truth?
Nix ran some kind of cult, right? Some kind of Charlie Manson deal?
It was more than that, I think.
It was more than that, I think.
He was the real thing, right?

He taught all this to Swann?

Some or it.
So Swann was performing magic. not illusions? And what? You thought he should be using it to cure cancer, not making millions.
I told you --
I told you --
Too much fame. Yeah, I guess that'd turn anybody's head. Including yours.

He thought Nix was coming back, didn't he?
It's okay.
No it isn't. You can't help me.
No it isn't. You can't help me.
I'm here, aren't I?
Nothing's going to happen to you.
Nothing?
Nothing?
Nothing you don't want.
I was so afraid.
Don't be. Nix can't hurt you now.
Don't be. Nix can't hurt you now.
Are you sure?
Are you sure?
I'm sure. He's dead.
I'm sure. He's dead.
I know. I'm the one who shot him.
I was twelve. Nix took me hostage, to get Swann to come to him.
And they all came...
And they all came...
Yes.
Yes.
Quaid and Jennifer--
Quaid and Jennifer--
And Pimm and Swann. Only Nix was ready for them.
What was that?

Are you all right?
Find Valentin! Find him! Get him in here!
Harry?
It's all right. It's not hurting...
Oh God!
Hang on!
I've got to help him.
You can't.
You can't.

You saw this?
Crank call. I'll get the number changed.
No word from D'Amour?
It's better he's gone. He would have done more harm than good.
Harm to whom? Me? I don't think, so. Try him again at the hotel.
Harm to whom? Me? I don't think, so. Try him again at the hotel.

You've taken some strange journeys in your life.

Are they all in the business?
It's not a business. Harry. It's a vocation.
That's what they call the Repository. Every magic secret known to man's locked up in that room.
Have you been in?
Have you been in?
No. There's only three keys. Vinovich has got one, of course. He's a little crazy, by the way. And he's a mean drunk. Otherwise, he's a real charmer.
A lot of people are going to be really pissed off when they discover you're still alive.
They'll never find out.
Look, Ma, no wires.

In D.C., my dad was the Ambassador to France in the eighties, so we went to school in Paris for a few years... but we mostly lived in D.C., and they were never around... and then I moved to Los Angeles when John and I got married... it's so different there.
I know.
John thinks I'm so snotty.
John thinks I'm so snotty.
You are.
You are.
I know, but that's what you like about me.
Why do you have to be with your opposite, why cant similar people be together?
Because that would be too easy.
You made it.
They really have to work on that street name thing.

How old is she?

Oh, she'll love it.
Nice one.

Yes, but no, I can't right now.
Oh, I guess you're busy, huh.
I don't want to be.
You can't get sushi anywhere in Japan after 2 o'clock. Did you know that?
No, we'll find something around here.
Well, I guess she's more around your age... You guys could talk about things in common, like growing up in the fifties.
You're a brat, wasn't there anyone else around to lavish you with attention?
What do you want to drink?
A coke.
So, where'd you go today.

Hair stuff?
I gotta go to work.

No! Hi! So great to meet you!
Uh..thanks.
Sorry if I have the worst B.O., I've been sweating in this little room with T.V. lights for hours...
Oh no...
...Well, I have the worst headache, I have to go find some aspirin. But, call me, let's have a drink, I'm under Evelyn Waugh.
I missed you.
Do you think they have a room here?
How'd your interview go? I'm sure you charmed the hell out of Sally.
She's a talk show host. They can't be charmed. By definition.
It's great of you to let William and Susan stay at the house until he gets on his feet.
It's Susan's cooking, Claire. That's why Uncle James lets them stay.
You never said anything to me...
It's probably trivial.
Shi... Sorry, honey. I was having the weirdest dream.
Bad?
Bad?
Weird. The book again. Sex spelled backwards...

Sushi.
I can't believe it's already starting to get dark so early.
Hmmm.
Hmmm.
You know, there was a guy on the radio today trying to explain why we're losing daylight. Quarks and dark matter, things like that. Even how daylight savings has caught up with us over the last hundred years and our universal watch is just fast, you know?
Peter, where are you?
Sorry. It's just...a strange woman waltzes into my office today. Tells me she murdered her parents and can prove Satan exists.

Now that you're on TV, you're a magnet for all the wackos out there.
Oh, Peter, you're going to pursue this.
No. Of course not. Mmmm. Anago. My favorite.
Hey, what are you doing here in the middle of the day?
Forgot my car keys. What are you doing on the fourth floor?
Forgot my car keys. What are you doing on the fourth floor?
I spaced out.
I spaced out.
Well, it's a nice surprise. Should I hit the "stop" button?
What? That's horrible!
What happened?
Yeah, I appreciate it. Thanks, Josef.
When did they find her?
I'm still shaking.
I can't believe Will killed him.
I can't believe Will killed him.
Thank God he did.
I'm gonna have to get a restraining order. What a nightmare.
I don't know. In a way, I'm glad it all happened.
You're glad somebody tried to kill me?
No, of course not, but I think now that this has happened, a lot of things can start to come out...
No, of course not, but I think now that this has happened, a lot of things can start to come out...
Yeah, like...

This is the person...you were talking about?

I don't know. What are they?

I found them in your file box.

Must be a spare set.

I thought the spare set was in the kitchen drawer.
Honey, you're exhausted. Do you want to lie down for a little while?
I found the pentacle.
She's been stalking you, Peter.
So you're going to kill her? Put the gun down Claire.
Listen to me, I love you, Peter, I'm trying to protect you!
You really had me going, Claire. I was finally ready to propose to you.
You really had me going, Claire. I was finally ready to propose to you.
We're still going to be together.
What a...jerk!
Peter, are you okay?
Nonsense, it's all of our home. So how's work treating you?
Frustrating. Form over content. Everything's so retro.
Frustrating. Form over content. Everything's so retro.
Well, if Peter here would hop off his laurels long enough to marry you...
...you wearing a watch, Father?
Yes. It's exactly...
You know, I made a reservation at Marco's for Peter's birthday dinner, but maybe you should cater it.
What time did you make it for?
What time did you make it for?
Eight. That okay?
Yes.
And how would you describe him?

George, come in. What the hell happened to you?
It's nothing.

Sure it is. If the guards did this, we can file charges.

You have to tell me who did it.
I can take care of myself.
I'm gonna go make a stink. Sit tight. I'll make sure you get a change of clothes.
Mr. Kelson, what a pleasure to meet you. I have to say your instincts about the criminally insane are impeccable. I am a fan.
Quite a compliment coming from you, doctor.
When your secretary called, she made no mention of her coming, too.
My secretary?
My secretary?
You're aware that this woman was party to the so-called exorcism.
You're aware that this woman was party to the so-called exorcism.
No, I wasn't, actually.
No, I wasn't, actually.
You should know I never felt Mr. Birdson needed anything but professional psychiatric care. And then, minutes after they left, he suffered a stroke. He's comatose. No brain wave activity at all.
So you don't believe his condition is the result of anything supernatural?
Of course not. They put him through severe mental stress. Causing this aneurysm.
Your court order, Dr. Allen.
You know I'm not comfortable with this.

I think I should join you.
Dr. Allen, could you please tell Mr. Kelson what you heard as you tried to enter Mr. Birdson's room?
I certainly hope you're not lending any credence to this.
I certainly hope you're not lending any credence to this.
What did you hear?
The patient was in great distress. Naturally he was...yelling.
And was he in distress when you opened the door? Or was he sitting here, relaxed, at this table?

I don't mean to belittle you, but we've been through this before. Satan is not what you think he is. Satan is not some creature.
You weren't there. Give me time to get some proof.
You weren't there. Give me time to get some proof.
Please, Maya. I'm trying to get us into the next century and you insist on this medieval nonsense.

If you really believe in God, why is it so inconceivable that his enemy is just as real?

Maya, for the last time, I will not tolerate these obsessions.
The doctor's concerned he may never come out of this dementia.
He will. He has great faith.
He will. He has great faith.
But bad judgement. And now you see how dangerous the consequences can be.
Is he going to be okay?
I hope so.
I've had it. Townsend's dead. The police are calling and now I see you having a scene in front of the children. I'm sorry, Maya, you've been with us for many years, but effective immediately, I'm rescinding your right to live at the church.
Father, I have nowhere else to stay.
Father, I have nowhere else to stay.
You have a sister in New Orleans.
You'll do it?
I don't have the experience. Father Thomas should officiate.
How're you doing? Looking lovely as always.
You ready?
Between your book sales and this TV thing, there's going to be no living with you. And let me guess, you boiled God down to a conceit.
You know how I feel. The world is random. The only certainty I believe in is death.
You know how I feel. The world is random. The only certainty I believe in is death.
Given all that's happened, I understand. The world is random, but then there's faith. Where are you in death without it?
What is it?
Something he said, just before...

He spoke to you?

Yeah. It didn't make any sense.
Yeah. It didn't make any sense.
Listen to me, Peter. You can't let the ravings of a madman disturb you, okay?
Listen to me, Peter. You can't let the ravings of a madman disturb you, okay?
You're right, but it's funny. All my life I thought I was simply a man who didn't believe in any of it.
You're right, but it's funny. All my life I thought I was simply a man who didn't believe in any of it.
No matter, my son, he believes in you.
No matter, my son, he believes in you.
But it's true. I have no faith. It's strange. When that gun was pointed at my face tonight, I was surprised, but never frightened. It was as if I knew nothing could possibly happen to me and...in that one moment I didn't care about anything. Not eve my own life.

Peter. Your life must matter to you because it matters to all of us who love you.
You know, I respect that you have such faith, James. I don't understand it, but I want you to know that despite our differences, I admire you and I always will.
You fucking bastard.
Don't you get it? They had their 2,000 years. Now it's our turn.

You killed my parents.
You killed my parents.
I had to. There was no other way. Their deaths were part of the greatest legacy I could have given you.
Why are you doing this to me?
I know, Maya, but you'll understand when you see this man. I really need your strength.
-- you wouldn't last five minutes.
Just open the door, please.
...the ark sank, the sun set, the ark sank again.
Father, I'm right here.
Father, I'm right here.
...the ark sank, the sun set, the ark sank again...
Father! Thank God you're better! I really need your help. We've only got a few more hours.
Don't worry...about the transformation, Maya.
Don't worry...about the transformation, Maya.
What do you mean "don't worry?"
What do you mean "don't worry?"
Well, in my prayers, I realized we've been fooling ourselves and probably... blown this all out of proportion. God would never allow anything like that to happen.
So...we won?
Yes. We won, that's right.
We won because Christ...triumphed over Satan?
Um hm. That's right, Maya.
Um hm. That's right, Maya.
So, if Christ won, that means, what does that mean, Father? That Satan...
So, if Christ won, that means, what does that mean, Father? That Satan...
Would you like to rest, Miette? You must be exhausted.
So I guess Satan lost. Satan is the weak one.
Miette, come here and relax.
Father, please don't die.
...art sank, sun set, ark sank again...
Hi, I'd like to make an appointment for Peter Kelson.
Kelson, hold on a second...

Two negatives always make a positive.
Oh, thank you, thank you so much!
Oh my God!

May I help you?

What if I told you I was a malignant narcissist?
A narcissist doesn't admit it. It's the extreme of self-denial.
And I also believe in God and the Devil. In fact, I know they exist.
And I also believe in God and the Devil. In fact, I know they exist.
Well, by saying that, you're acknowledging the existence of a higher power. Which, to a narcissist, is impossible.

I murdered my parents, Mr. Kelson. And while they deserved it, I still went to confession the following Sunday.
Ooooooh-kayyyyyy.
In the end, the jury saw it my way.
In the end, the jury saw it my way.
Well, then it all seems to be working out for you. Listen, Ms...?

Do you remember Henry Birdson? The math professor who won the Salwen Medal, then went home and killed his family?

Last week the Catholic Church certified him as genuinely possessed. You realize how rarely they make that ruling?

I do.
I do.
An exorcism was just held for Birdson. It failed. Disastrously. Which means there's still a demonic spirit present in his body. I was wondering, perhaps you'd like to go meet Henry. He's pretty amazing.

On television, you seemed so sure of yourself. If you're really that confident, you'd be willing to let someone prove you wrong?

The world would be so much simpler if it were all just about good and evil. Unfortunately I find it much more slippery and elusive place.

Well, I think it's very simple. Here's a tape of Birdson's exorcism. I'll be at the Public Library. Tomorrow at 2... if you want to meet him.
So...what did you think of the tape.
I think you gave me the wrong one.
I think you gave me the wrong one.
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
It was blank. Nothing on it. You gave me the wrong one.
You're sure? There was nothing?
I cranked it all the way up. Nothing but hum.
So what'd I miss?
You're right. I must've made a mistake.
Where do you get off pretending to be my secretary?
I had to.
I had to.
And this is evil? The guy had an aneurysm and now he's in a coma.

That's their explanation. You might not believe me...
Well, why should I? Alright, what's your name, where do you live, when did you kill your parents?
We need to talk.
Peter, please...
Last night a guy named John Townsend tried to shoot me and now I find out you knew him. What the fuck is going on?
Please, the children.
Why did he try to kill me?
Townsend believed, just as God became man in Christ. So Satan will assume human form. I believe it too.
And the point is?
At the exorcism, Birdson boasted that Satan is about to take over the body of a man. You are that man, Peter.

What?!?!
What?!?!
It's true. Birdson knew your name, he was writing it in numerical code. It wasn't easy but I figured it out. It spelled your name.

If you're possessed, you can't reveal anything Satan wants hidden. Unless you trick him.

The good outwitting the bad. It's like Birdson had a split personality.

You're already contaminated. It's why you couldn't hear the tape. There's probably a pentacle near your bed. To sanctify you.

I know this sounds crazy. I understand. Check your parents' blood types. Are you sure your parents are your birth parents?
I know this sounds crazy. I understand. Check your parents' blood types. Are you sure your parents are your birth parents?
My parents are dead. Don't even think of bringing them into this.
You're about to become the anti-Christ who is born unholy and becomes the door to eternal suffering in this world.
If you or any of your lunatic friends ever come near me again...
I don't understand what's going on.
There's no reason why you should. This has been planned from your birth. You fit all the criteria that we know of. Never baptized, born of incest, devoid of faith...

But I was baptized. And I certainly wasn't born of incest.

You were not baptized. At least I don't believe it was Christian. Your baptism was performed by your uncle, James McKenzie.

Yes, I know.

The only baptism he ever performed in seven years as pastor at Bedford.

Seven years. One baptism? He's your mother's only brother

Yes.
Do you know your parents' blood types?
I looked at the coroner's report. My father's O positive and my mother...A negative.
I looked at the coroner's report. My father's O positive and my mother...A negative.
Peter, your blood-type is AB negative. There's no way your birth father can be O positive. You father is not who you think he is.
Peter, your blood-type is AB negative. There's no way your birth father can be O positive. You father is not who you think he is.
So...then the coroner's report is probably wrong. I mean...this is ridiculous. There's been a mistake. I don't believe any of this.
So...then the coroner's report is probably wrong. I mean...this is ridiculous. There's been a mistake. I don't believe any of this.
Then why are you here?
Peter, I believe your baptism was perverted. Look at your certificate. Your mother was the only witness to it. Your blood-type doesn't match who you thought your father was. Peter...I'm sorry.
And if what you're saying is true, what would happen to me?
And if what you're saying is true, what would happen to me?
I don't know. I do know that people who are possessed have to accept evil in some way. I don't know if it works the same way in this instance. I don't even know when it's going to happen.
When Townsend tried to kill me, he said something strange like... "The time of transformation is near..."
Townsend, he had some of Father's books.
What are you looking for exactly?
The books themselves or maybe some pages he ripped out.
We needed to know all we could.
I'm going to look around.
Nothing yet.
I'll go outside and take a look in the garage.
Get up!!
What's the...OH SHIT!
Peter, let go of the chair!
What?
You okay?
When's your birthday?
When's your birthday?
What?
Hang on, get it up, go on, higher.
Your 33rd birthday. The transformation will be a perversion of Christ's rising from the dead. Townsend discovered it in one of Lareaux's books.
It'll happen at the exact time of your birth.
That can't be right. My birthday's tomorrow.
He couldn't stop us and that's how he was punished. Peter, what time were you born?
I don't know. Probably have a copy of my birth certificate...my apartment.
There's nothing else here.
What's the bible for?
What's the bible for?
Comfort.
Are you alright?
Sometimes, when I feel weak, I have these...visions.
Sometimes, when I feel weak, I have these...visions.
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
I see things. My worst fears. You need to know something, Peter. I was possessed once. Like Birdson. It took Father Lareaux six days to pull me out of it.
I'm scared I'm slipping back.
We're going to do this.
We're going to do this.
You have to say that.
You have to say that.
That's true.
Why did you lie to me about your parents' deaths?
I was desperate. I knew you wrote about murders. I needed a way in.
Close call. For the first time in a long time, it's really hitting me. Life's tenuous.
I know it is. Right after my parents died, I went to the beach... I was in the water. Everything was calm. And then one of those really big waves hit me. Hard. Pulled me straight to the bottom. I struggled and finally ran out of air. If it hadn't been for my sister who pulled me out, I would've drowned. Legally dead for

Until it happens, you're still a human being.
Until it happens, you're still a human being.
What about after?
What about after?
Only your body will remain. I believe your soul will be at peace. If we kill you, Satan can't stay.
Plenty of time.
What are these?
What are these?
I don't know. Extra apartment keys. What's it matter?
I don't know. Extra apartment keys. What's it matter?
Maybe I should check Lareaux's book. It's in the car. Be right back. Don't go anywhere.
Maybe I should check Lareaux's book. It's in the car. Be right back. Don't go anywhere.
Sure.
What can I do?
You have to be experienced to do this. Just wait outside. Otherwise, you risk killing him.
I'll be all right. Peter, at the very end, I think Father was back. I saw it in his eyes.
So, what does it mean. The ark sank and the sun set?
So, what does it mean. The ark sank and the sun set?
He's been repeating that since Birdson's exorcism. I looked in every passage in the Bible and there's nothing about an ark or a sunset that tells us anything.

That's his, I don't know, his 'grounding' phrase for me, "together, no matter what."
That's his, I don't know, his 'grounding' phrase for me, "together, no matter what."
Terrific.
He was trying to tell me something.
And his message was "Together, no matter what?"
Book five, Deuteronomy, chapter seven, verse five. "But this shall you deal with them. You shall break down their altars and burn their graven images with fire."
And what's that mean?
How much time do we have?
Not a lot.
Oh, Peter.
It's me. Put the gun down. Maya...
Good seeing you again.
Whish the circumstances were different.
Hello?
I know who he is.
I know who he is.
Maya? What do you mean?
Maya? What do you mean?
I'll explain everything later. Can you meet me tonight?
And what are you thinking we should do now?
I've filed a report with Father Frank.

Alright, Maya. We'll do it your way.
It's useless...look at him.
You can't back out on me now. We need to be sure.
You can't back out on me now. We need to be sure.
Sure of what? Who cares if this guy is devoid of faith or sleeps over a pentacle? Results are what Lareaux would want.
You don't want to face it.
Look, John, I'm facing it.
Look, John, I'm facing it.
I'm not waiting until it's too late.
I'd appreciate it if you'd put that back.
You are the younger of two...
But she worships you. Your mother's dead but your father's alive.
Nothing you couldn't find out from reading the papers. And you're already wrong on one count.

Viznick will get off and Michael's got a crush on you.
You know what? You can go.
Suit yourself. But does this mean anything to you?
You do know, don't you. That these are also numbers. Greek numbers, 600, 60 and 6 - or 666. The sign of the Devil.
Get out of here.
Get out of here.
Goodbye.
Mr. Kelson, here's the stuff you wanted on pathological narcissism.

Yeah.
It's Detective Smythe.
Good of you to stop by.
We millionaires yet?
As a part of today's story on the trial of mass murderer George Viznick, we welcome Peter Kelson, author of the current best-seller, VICIOUS INTENT. Thank you for joining us, Peter.
Thanks for having me, Sally.
Thanks for having me, Sally.
Peter, you're now writing a book about the Viznick case. You seem to be making a career of studying sensational murderers. I have to ask, how does it make you feel when you sit in courtrooms day after day, face to face with alleged killers?

Well, long-term exposure to things like this tends to give you a sort of clinical understanding of the subject. After awhile, you begin to make friends with it, so to speak.

No, the less mystifying. Good and evil are only illusions. There is no such thing as evil with a capital "E." That suggests some third party bad guy pulling all the strings.

Well, George Viznick is in the grayest of gray areas in the sanity spectrum. Viznick is not psychotic. He's simply unable to submit to any higher authority.

Right. If you believe in God. As a narcissist, Viznick couldn't blame himself for the alleged murders. He created the voices after the fact. In order to avoid the simple truth that there is no outside force that guides George Viznick and that George Viznick needs to pay.

And what about you? What about Peter Kelson? Where is your moral compass?
Would you sign it for me?
Of course.
Hey! Mr. big shot.
Mike. Oh, the christening. I meant to call...
Mike. Oh, the christening. I meant to call...
Yeah, right. I don't know why I bothered inviting you guys. I knew you wouldn't show.
So, Viznick's got a meet with his lawyer in the ayem.
Really? You know, seeing these guys away from the court, the facade slips. You catch things.
Really? You know, seeing these guys away from the court, the facade slips. You catch things.
Yeah, yeah. I've heard it before. Just be sure you spell my name right. Nine o'clock?
What's this?
So you can see where you're going when you crawl up his asshole.
Seems George isn't making too many friends in lockup.
Yeah, look at that sweet face. You'd never guess he killed nine people. I'm gonna get my smokes. Be right back.
Yeah, look at that sweet face. You'd never guess he killed nine people. I'm gonna get my smokes. Be right back.
You're too old to smoke. Won't be able to shoot hoops with your grandkid.
What's the matter with you?
He's looking right at me.
He could see me.
I'll quit, maybe you should start.
Thanks for handling this.
Sure thing. Look, I've got enough, between your preliminary statements and all the witness accounts. You can go home. Gimme til morning. Find out who he is. Until then, don't sweat it, huh? Just your random bad cheese trying to hole you.
Thanks again for everything.
Hey, don't thank me. Somebody up there likes you.
What's up?
How're you doin' today?
How're you doin' today?
It's another day. I think I'm alright.
It's another day. I think I'm alright.
You got the right attitude, anyway, look, we gotta talk.
She came to me with a wild story about demonic possession.
She's got a juvenile record from New Orleans. Parents died when she was 13.

Mother killed the father, then killed herself. Crime of passion.
She told me she killed them.

Not what the records show. Anyway, she was a runaway, arrests for vandalism, petty theft, drugs, the whole bit. Parole records show she graduated from community college, moved into a retreat house, teaches some classes at the seminary school, hasn't been in any trouble since.
We hauled her in earlier but didn't have anything hard to tie her to Townsend. Far as the priest goes, he won't be bothering you. Suffered a complete mental breakdown, during - get this - during an exorcism.
Where is she now?
Where is she now?
Had to let her go. I see you thinkin' there, superstar. Don't.
Monica, what did you do?
Nothing.
Nothing.
Oh, all that work.
Ah, Mom.
I'm lucky I found it. Someone put your box of dresses under a pile of rags in the garbage.
I hate it.
Fine, you don't like this one, which one would you rather wear?
Fine, you don't like this one, which one would you rather wear?
Pants.
nothing.
I don't know why I keep hoping you'll grow out of this tomboy thing.
I don't know why I keep hoping you'll grow out of this tomboy thing.
I won't. I'm a lesbian.
That's not funny
Well, that's what you think, isn't it? Cause I'd rather wear a jersey than an apron...

Watch your mouth.
Taste this.
I can't eat before a game.
I can't eat before a game.
Child, take a bite.
You really should be a caterer or something like you used to say.
Sure. In between all the other things I have to do.
What?
Nothing. So good luck.
What?
Tonight, don't worry about yesterday's game, the recruiters, or anything else. I just want you to enjoy being beautiful. Will you do that?
Monica. What are you doing here?
Didn't know I needed a reason to come home.
Didn't know I needed a reason to come home.
Don't be defensive. I'm just surprised to see you.
Don't be defensive. I'm just surprised to see you.
Dad around?
Dad around?
He's still at the bank.
What?
Whenever you lose, you get this attitude. But it's just a game.
Hi.
Need any help?
Need any help?
I can manage.
Yeah. Can't wait to see him I just saw Quincy.
How is he?
How is he?
Engaged.
Engaged.
To that stewardess?

Yeah, you met her?

His mother had a cookout a few weeks ago. He could do a lot better if you ask me.

So what do I do?
Find out where they're registered and send them a gift.

Whatever.

You didn't want my opinion in the first place, so why even ask?

I asked but why does it always have to be so damn prissy.
I asked but why does it always have to be so damn prissy.
Don't curse.
Don't curse.
There you go.
There you go.
What do you want me to tell you, Monica, to go beat that girl up? To go have sex with him? I'm not going to do that. Yes, I believe thinking of other people is important and yes I'd rather bake a pie than shoot a dumb jump shot. If that makes me too "prissy" for you, too bad.
So that's why we can't get along? Because I'd rather shoot a "dumb" jump shot?
You're the one always turning your nose up at me.
You're the one always turning your nose up at me.
No I don't.
No I don't.
Child, please. Ever since you were little you thought you were too good for anything I had to say.

I wasn't Lena. I didn't care about nail polish or lip gloss or sneaking a spray of your perfume.

What was so wrong with wanting to teach you the things I knew could help you?
What was so wrong with wanting to teach you the things I knew could help you?
Because you're pushing me to be something I'm not.
Because you're pushing me to be something I'm not.
So you're angry with me because you're standing here with your hair combed and wearing perfume?
I'm angry because I want a mother, not Martha Stewart.
Oh, yes. The superstar female athlete whose mother is nothing but a housewife.
Oh, yes. The superstar female athlete whose mother is nothing but a housewife.
That's not it.
That's not it.
Don't tell me you aren't ashamed of that because I know.
I remember when I was eight years old, you spent like four hours cooking up this fancy meal. All you'd let me and Lena do was set the table. And I guess you and Dad got your wires crossed or something because he walks in with a couple of pizzas. And you didn't say anything. You just threw the whole meal into some tupper-ware
I don't remember that.
I don't remember that.
I do. You never stood up for yourself. Ever. If I was ashamed, it was because of that.
I do. You never stood up for yourself. Ever. If I was ashamed, it was because of that.
That's ridiculous.
That's ridiculous.
What's ridiculous is not being a caterer so your husband can feel like a man knowing his woman's home cooking and ironing his drawers.
That's all you cared about. I must have played in a thousand games and I can only remember you being to two.
You had your coaches and your father for that stuff. It never mattered one way or the other if I went to your games.
You had your coaches and your father for that stuff. It never mattered one way or the other if I went to your games.
It mattered, Mom.
What are you talking about?
When I said Quincy could do better, I was thinking about you.
She needs to stop running around like a little boy.
She's alright.
She's alright.
How is she alright looking the way she does?
How is she alright looking the way she does?
Camille, she'll be fine.
Which one for tomorrow?
The blue.
The blue.
You sure?
Okay.
Thanks, sweetheart.
When you're done can you make sure she brushes her teeth?
Are you okay?
Are you okay?
I just need to lay down. I've been running around all day.
...and if you want a thicker base, you can cut in a potato or just use a little flour.
But you use potato?
So that means it's alright for you to act like that?
What'd you do?
So you're still breast-feeding?
The doctor said it was okay. Anyway, I'm still trying to lose some of this baby fat.
You might want to put a jacket on him, it's getting cold.
He's fine.
He's fine.
Okay.
...we moved back here when Quincy was about five, after Zeke was traded. Neighborhood was a little more mixed back then...
Until the Black family down the street became the Black family next door.
Until the Black family down the street became the Black family next door.
Okay?
Well, thanks again. This was really nice of you.
It was the least we could do. And I love to cook.
Oh, me too. I used to cook for my friends' parties and things back in Atlanta.
You're a caterer?
You're a caterer?
Well, no, but once Nathan gets settled and the girls get a little older, it's definitely something I want to do. Since you love to cook, maybe it's something we can talk about.
You know, girl, long as I've lived next door, I've never seen the inside of this house.
Really? Well, come on, then.
I can take it.
This time get your feet set.
What?
You love to pose so much, let's see it again.
Coach...
I want you to stand like that until you're sick of it because I don't ever want to see it again, you hear me? Dora, take her spot.
You could've given up after you threw that ball away. But you kept your head and you showed real heart.
Thanks.
Thanks.
We've got our final games against Oregon and Oregon State and I want to shake things up a bit, so I'm starting you at point again.

You think I'd go hoarse for a player with no potential? When I ignore you, that's when you worry. Go get dressed.
Can I take your coat?
You're cold?
No, I mean I can check it for you.
Oh, sorry.
I'm an English major. You like English?
Sort of.
Sort of.
Careful.
Careful.
Huh?
Huh?
That was two words.
Sorry.

You know what it's like to come home scared, scared that maybe if you don't have the money you're supposed to go out each day and get that you're gonna get beaten....by a belt...he hits me with a belt, Stanley.... I'm supposed to sell those candy bars, and if I don't, I come home without the money....

I can take you to get money. I don't need it...I don't <u>need</u> it -- listen to me: I can let you have money so your father won't hit you ever again -- you'll have the money because I don't need it.

No, stay back! Stay back!

Nothing... Nothing.
Anne...! I know... I know that to love you is treason against France. But not to love you... is treason against my heart.
Then we will both die traitors, d'Artagnan.
My Queen...
D'Artagnan.
I have never seen a sight more beautiful than you, tonight.
We have much to discuss. Tomorrow.
There were two. Not one. But two.
I couldn't tell you. You had enough to carry.
I couldn't tell you. You had enough to carry.
Anne... The night we had together... I always wanted more. But that one, it was enough. Enough to make me love you forever. I want you to remember that... and go on. As strong as you are now. No matter what happens.
Mother -- ?
May I speak with you? Alone?

I am preparing for a ball!

We haven't visited in three years. And we should have privacy.

He is dead! By God's choice! There is nothing to discuss.

First they told me he had died at birth. Then your father admitted he was alive, but well cared for, in secret. But the message that told of his death said he had been a prisoner.

You have prayed too much. Your mind is weak.
It -- it doesn't matter, Mother! He is dead now! Dead!
Yes. Dead. Two nights ago. The night of my dream.
Louis, please -- !
My guards are useless! Take her from me!
What had you to do with this, Mother?
He is your brother!
He is your brother!
He is nothing now.
D'Artagnan, you will hunt down Aramis, Porthos and Athos, and bring me their heads, or I will have yours. And as for you, Phillippe... Back to the prison you shall go, and into the mask you hate.
No, Louis! No!
No, Louis! No!
Wear it until you love it. And die in it!!
Your birthday celebration, your Majesty?
Next week. This is a mere garden party -- and I wish to join it, so I will be brief. I am experiencing resistance from the Jesuits.

How can I serve you in this?

Perhaps you can find out who this secret leader of the Jesuits is. You are now a priest, but you were once a Musketeer, serving the throne of France, a throne ordained of God. Can you accept this mission, and keep it private?

You bring me the heart of the Jesuit General, and you will have a palace of your own.
Wh-- Wha--
Don't look so shocked, Phillippe. Come, you're going back to prison.
Don't look so shocked, Phillippe. Come, you're going back to prison.
Phillippe?! Why do you call me --
D'Artagnan, arrest them all!
Shut up, knave!
And some problems cannot be settled without one.
Well here is the problem at hand: the King has ordered me to discover the identity of the Governor General of Jesuits, and kill him. As our English rivals have left the Catholic Church, Louis has struck on a plan to dominate the whole of Europe by uniting Church and State and making himself head of both. He has already picked the Pope. Only
What do you propose to do?
Replace the king.
It can. I know the way.
I am with you!
What are they doing?
Making the key to the throne.
Porthos sleeps, and you plot. Don't you think it's time you told me what it is you are plotting?
Soon enough. Here we are.
The Prison of Belle Sur.
Come, we have a boat waiting.
What is that?
A body.
A body.
I see that is a body! But where did you get it?
Prison was horrible but it was his home. He's been torn from it by strangers. He's frightened, exhausted -- and the mask is familiar. Let him rest in it tonight, and remove it tomorrow.
Excellent, Athos. You have a keen sense of this man.
Excellent, Athos. You have a keen sense of this man.
His plight is obvious, isn't it?
Who is he, Aramis?
Tomorrow.
Tomorrow.
Tonight! Right now! We steal a man from a royal prison, we hide in a country chateau among an assortment of saints and sluts such as only you could provide, and still you wish to tell me nothing?!

Then you are a fool -- a fool who has never lost a son. What gives you the right to judge me, to play God with the lives of others? Is it because you are so much holier than everyone else?!

The King is having a ball, a masquerade ball. It is the perfect opportunity and perhaps our only one. At any time Phillippe could be discovered, and what then? Remember France. Remember the poor. Remember Raoul. More wine!! Where are those serving girls...?
Phillippe -- he's very bright, he's perceptive, but he is in such turmoil --
You grow fond of him. That's good.
You grow fond of him. That's good.
Don't play God with me, Aramis I --
Go on.
But -- what is Porthos doing?

Going into the barn naked -- or so it appears.
Now. You were saying?
But -- what is he doing?

About to hang himself, I should think.

He's threatened to do it, it's been building up in him for months.

Poor Phillippe!
The mask is terrifying... especially when unexpected. Do you notice?

Where are you going?!

Aramis, this will never --
Louis is planning a visit to the Vatican, then who knows where after that. If we miss him now we may not get another chance.

It presses us but it is good for us too! Louis' whims make him more vulnerable. We are less ready, but so are his guards!
Remember, Phillippe... nobility is born in the heart.
Hold your goblet with two fingers.
Bloody hell...
We can't... stay here. That traitor d'Artagnan... knows about this place.
He seeks redemption.
You're a fool!
You're a fool!
Perhaps. But of d'Artagnan I am certain. What he did tonight was what he told us all along he would do -- be faithful to his King.
Perhaps. But of d'Artagnan I am certain. What he did tonight was what he told us all along he would do -- be faithful to his King.
So what has changed?

Then to the Bastille.
To the Bastille. And death.
A simple theological discussion.
Aramis -- the King wishes to see you.
Aramis -- the King wishes to see you.
Still you serve him loyally -- though people hurl rotten eggs at his royal emblem.
Look at us. We are old men now. But once we were young. And when we saw injustice, we fought it.
We have grown wiser with age. Now we know that some problems cannot be settled with a sword.
No! Stop --
I will need you all. All for one. One for all.
I will need you all. All for one. One for all.
You -- You cannot ask me to betray my king! I have sworn to him!
I have heard many confessions, d'Artagnan. But even if I were not a priest, I could tell your heart has a secret weight, and it is hurting you to carry it alone.
The secret I carry I cannot share. Not even with God.
I cannot betray Louis. I will defend him with my life.
I know. God go with you.
Pull them back, d'Artagnan.
You can't do it.
You can't do it.
Pull them back!
Pull them back!
Everyone back.
Everyone back.
Phillippe, get into the boat. Into the boat! Now!
Once you are through, don't stop until you reach the river.
They will know you helped us, if we go this way.
They will know you helped us, if we go this way.
That doesn't matter now.
D'Artagnan... Those are young Musketeers down there. They have been weaned on our legends. They revere us -- it is an advantage. Why don't we charge them?
I trained those men myself. They will stand and fight. But if we are to die, let it be this way.
Please revel with me, Aramis, I need my spirits lifted. I'm old, I'm weak, my strength is gone --
Be quiet, you fat fool. Can't you see I'm praying?
Be quiet, you fat fool. Can't you see I'm praying?
I just said you're praying! Are you deaf too? I know you're blind, because if you had seen the tits that just walked out of here, you'd have tears in your eyes.

There are more important things than tits.
There are more important things than tits.
Really? If you can name me one thing, one single thing, that is more sublime than the feel of a plump pink nipple between my lips, I will buy you a new cathedral.
Forgiveness.
Forgiveness?
I observe your forgiveness isn't sweeter than a plump nipple.
Can't you see I'm praying, goddammit?!
Aramis... is this the way to hell?
Hell may be our destination, dear Porthos, but not this trip.
Where are we?
Jesus of Nazareth found the holy among the profane. If we are to have a place of private prayer, where better than here, beside the channels where the shit and the garbage run to the river?
Mother of God!
It is also a place of burial.
It is also a place of burial.
A tomb? We're in a tomb?

Catacombs. Very holy.
But -- doesn't God ordain both Pope and King?
So they tell us. But what are we to believe when the king is a tyrant, and the Church, meant to stand for all those oppressed, has become the tool of oppression? When no conscience is tolerated? No dissent, no objection?

It is a weighty problem, Aramis -- but perhaps you should leave it to this secret General of the Jesuits, whoever he might be.
It is a weighty problem, Aramis -- but perhaps you should leave it to this secret General of the Jesuits, whoever he might be.
Easy to say, but hard to do. For what I am trying to tell you is that I am the Governor General of Jesuits in France.
And why are you so glum?
I expected action. There was no killing, no fighting, I was useless.
Aramis! Athos! He looks exactly like... exactly like...
I will answer all your questions. But first soap, water, and a razor.
The greatest secret of life is who we truly are. Now I must give you that secret, which has been kept from you your whole life. It began on the night when Louis was born.
I remember that night. D'Artagnan was drunk, the only time I've seen him that way. The three of us were reveling, remember, Athos?
I remember that night. D'Artagnan was drunk, the only time I've seen him that way. The three of us were reveling, remember, Athos?
But I was on duty...
I don't understand. What does this have to do with...? You carried a baby somewhere, it's unusual, but --
Not just a baby, Porthos. I carried the child of the king.
Not just a baby, Porthos. I carried the child of the king.
The child of the king is... the king. Louis!
The child of the king is... the king. Louis!
No, not Louis!
No, not Louis!
Athos, do you understand this? He confuses me --
Athos, do you understand this? He confuses me --
I carried the king's child! The queen had twins that night, and one of them was sent away, in secret!
I carried the king's child! The queen had twins that night, and one of them was sent away, in secret!
But why?
But why?
Because the old king had a twin as well, and through his whole reign his brother fought him for the throne. Then he had two heirs, not just sons but twins. So he decided that one be put away, as if he never existed. You, Phillippe.
You've been moping for months. Now that you've gotten the idea of killing yourself out of the way, you can stop boring me and start being useful to me. Now get some rest.
Well... Well... Okay.
Coming?
What use am I?
What use am I?
We go someplace dangerous.
We go someplace dangerous.
Why didn't you say so?
Let's see you rob somebody with your pistol there!
Come on...
Aramis... These are... these are whores!
So was Mary Magdalene, and our Lord loved her.
So was Mary Magdalene, and our Lord loved her.
Did she have tits like that?
He's going to kill you, Aramis.
Then let him kill me, if all my faith is wrong.
But what if something extraordinary happened? Something so unusual that all the attention went to someone else? Someone whose confirmation of Phillippe the King would never be questioned.
Who?
Who?
The Queen Mother. Anne.
D'Artagnan watches everything. We have to be lucky.
We will make our own luck tonight... if Phillippe holds up.
Can we eat... before we go? This excitement's given me an appetite.
Bread and wine... in that cupboard.
D'Artagnan. Perhaps you should accept his offer, for we are dead anyway.
He is right, d'Artagnan.
He gets one day of confession each year. Today is the day.
Who does?
Who does?
Best not to ask. Shouldn't even talk about it.
What do we do now?
I don't know about you, but I plan to wait here.
D'Artagnan, unready?
At a ball, everyone watches the King!
"Phillippe has been removed to the Bastille, to the lower dungeon. At midnight tonight I will order the guard changed, and will delay the replacements for ten minutes. That should give you ample time. Never have I needed more to say: One for all, and all for one. D'Artagnan."
He lures us to capture.
What choice is there? If Phillippe is in the Bastille, then to the Bastille we will go.
You are right. But it is a trap.
You are right. But it is a trap.
So what? I'd rather die covered in blood, than an old man, lying in my own piss.
It worked!
It's a prison, you idiot! They don't expect anyone to try getting in! The problem will come when we want out!
Do I look all right?
None of the ladies will be able to take their eyes off you.
None of the ladies will be able to take their eyes off you.
I care only about Michelle. Should I ask her when we first arrive? Or... or when we're leaving? I could ask her in the carriage -- but it is more romantic at the palace. I get so confused...

Mother's ring. I can't take this.
She died giving you to me. And I want to die knowing it is one the finger of the women my son loves.
That must be Raoul! Raoul! Look, d'Artagnan's come to visit...! What's wrong? You look awful!
Michelle, she -- The king has invited her to come live in the palace.
But -- are you sure?
We were at her door. I was just taking the ring from my pocket, for the third time today, when a young Musketeer brought the invitation for her to become a lady-in-waiting for the Queen Mother.

She cannot possibly refuse. Her family is poor, they have even less money than we do. And along with the invitation, the King sent the diamond pendant, from the piglet.

I was feeling sorry for myself. Raoul is getting married, he proposed today! I love that boy beyond all measure, I've spent everything I own to give him education and opportunity. Now he has complete happiness, and I mope.
This cannot be. Everyone knows the Queen Mother is a recluse, and the ladies-in-waiting are but mistresses for the king!
If the young woman truly loves Raoul --
If the young woman truly loves Raoul --
She's a woman, d'Artagnan! From a poor family. You may still be young enough to believe love conquers everything, but I am old and hard and I've seen too much. Even when kings are hunchbacks they have any woman they desire, because power seduces even more than love!
You knew this was happening. You knew and that's why you came.
I fear I know our King. I came to try to bring you hope.

I know.
Oh my friend.
I will also speak with the King, for he is surely unaware of the problems his invitation to Mademoiselle Beaufort has caused.
You trust his character more than anyone else does.
You trust his character more than anyone else does.
Raoul is hurrying to the front, so I must hurry too.
Raoul is hurrying to the front, so I must hurry too.
Save my son, d'Artagnan.
Athos, please...!
Get out of my way.
Get out of my way.
Athos, I beg you --
Where are you going?
To kill the king.
Athos! I know life means nothing to you at this moment, but I will not let you kill yourself.
The King killed my son!
The King killed my son!
The cannons killed Raoul! The cannons, and love. But not the King.
It is honor you serve, and when the king is dishonorable you are removed from your oath of honor!
An oath is an oath precisely because it cannot be removed!
An oath is an oath precisely because it cannot be removed!
Why do you follow him, d'Artagnan?! I know you have put service above your own life, but why does this King deserve such loyalty? He is a monster! He executes ministers for his own blunders, with their families hostage so they take the blame! He has no honor!

No man is all bad... or all good. I believe -- I must believe -- that Louis can learn. And perhaps I can help him.
If you ever loved me -- if you ever loved honor, or anything else -- then stand now, and let it happen.
I cannot, Athos. Dearly as I love you, I cannot.
He lies. He is here to trap us.
I came to see you safely out. Check for yourself.
Recent hours have been a shock.
Perhaps not as much as you might imagine. When tutors answered every question except those about who I was. When I was imprisoned in a way no other man had ever been, I knew there was something different about me. But a king...

Phillippe... there is something I hope you understand. Terrible cruelty has been used against you. And... you must understand that you did nothing to deserve it.
Phillippe... there is something I hope you understand. Terrible cruelty has been used against you. And... you must understand that you did nothing to deserve it.
There is... wrath... in me. I have learned to hide it. Those years in the cell, I dreamed that freedom would someday just happen, the way the mask happened. Now I am free. And with each free breath I feel the growing desire to make someone suffer for all I lost. Look at this, all this that for ten years I could not see!

The desire for vengeance... can be a poison.
The desire for vengeance... can be a poison.
What is its antidote?
What is its antidote?
I suppose... it is to remember there are many people who have never been in a prison, who pass such beauty every day, and never see it.
You look so sad. Is it something I have done?
It is something I have done -- or did not do.
It is something I have done -- or did not do.
What is that?
What is that?
I did not share beauty with someone... who is no longer here for me to share beauty with.
I've worn this mask so long, I couldn't sleep without it.
I will sit with you. I can't sleep either.
I am so sorry! Forgive me, I --
No! Do not be sorry! Never be sorry! The King cares for nothing and for no one! There are no mistakes when you are King! What you do is right for every person! A King has contempt for everyone!

Is that the king of king you wish me to be? Or do you say this because of your son?

How did you know -- ?
How did you know -- ?
Porthos told me.
These rooms are yours. Up these stairs -- or through this hidden passage -- is the room of your mistress... Michelle.
Whose rooms are those?
Whose rooms are those?
Your mother's.
The room of the King's favorite mistress?
She will be at the ball.
Phillippe...?
How did you --
One for all. All for one.
If I could have a blade, then I would be please to run with you.
All this time... I was a lost secret. But you were hiding all your loyalty, all your love. You were the Man in the Iron Mask.
D'Artagnan...
Are you hungry?
Just... water.
This place... I once lived in a country house. I had guardians -- an old man and woman. And tutors. But no friends. Then when I was twelve, they came and took me to the prison.
Who came?
Who came?
A man in black. I never saw his face. He took me to the cell. A blacksmith came and they put me into the mask. For days I shouted, "What have I done? Why do you do this to me?" But no one heard, so I just stopped shouting.

The old man and woman called me... Phillippe.
Phillippe. Rest now.
Your Majesty...
What is it, d'Artagnan? Assassins falling from the sky now?
The plans for use of the maze were not disclosed to me.
I decided it this morning.

But I deployed the Royal Guards according to your previous --
Let us play a game, d'Artagnan, let us pretend I am King and you are Captain of my Musketeers. Let us behave as if my wish is law. And my wish is to enjoy this party!
Aaa! D'Artagnan! These passages were constructed for the King's security, not so you could step from my father's portrait and startle me to death!
It is for your security that I have come, your Majesty -- for the security of your honor.
It is for your security that I have come, your Majesty -- for the security of your honor.
I already know about the riots, d'Artagnan, I heard them out there whispering. Some fool gave the order to distribute rotten food. I will deal with it tomorrow.

Then there is one more thing, of an even more personal nature.

Mademoiselle Michelle Beaufort. She is betrothed to Raoul, the son of Athos the Musketeer, who has served France through many tribulations.
Betrothed? I think not.
In his mind, anyway, and soon enough in hers. She had written him many letters of love.
Miss Beaufort has accepted our invitation. By this we can only suppose that she wishes to come -- as we wish her to be here.
Your Majesty has had many women --

That is my desire, and my desire is what should concern you, not the sentiments of some commoner!
That is my desire, and my desire is what should concern you, not the sentiments of some commoner!
It is not Raoul's heart alone that concerns me. It is yours. I know you find women compliant -- especially the poorer ones like Michelle. But do they love you? Do you love them? What about a queen to love? A son of your own?

What quaint notions, d'Artagnan! But they contradict my father, who picked his queen when he was old, and only then to bear me.

Silence! I order you!

Order Fromberge to keep him in safety! It is the least you can do, to protect your own honor!

I will consider it. Now leave me.
I will consider it. Now leave me.
Thank you, your Majesty.
I just left the garden, it was empty. What did you see?
It... was nothing. A nightmare, nothing more. Go away, I --
Your Majesty. This ball, with an open invitation to the nobility of Paris -- we have no way of checking --
You will protect me as you always have, d'Artagnan.
Your Majesty...?
... tired. Must... lie down.
I want all these passages sealed! Another stupid idea of my father's! Seal them all, every one!
It shall be done, your Majesty.
It shall be done, your Majesty.
Even the bedchamber passages! Let none remain!
Even the bedchamber passages! Let none remain!
Yes, your Majesty.
I was told this impostor was dead!
... You knew you had a double?
... You knew you had a double?
He is my brother.
I -- I thought he was but... an impostor who resembled --
My twin. Which has kept him alive. Until now.
Your Majesty... This man before you... He is royal blood, the same as you. To spill it is the one thing even you cannot do. It is against the laws of God, and of France.
Get out of my way.
Get out of my way.
Not once have I ever asked anything for myself. I ask now. Forgive this man, this prisoner... your brother.
Not once have I ever asked anything for myself. I ask now. Forgive this man, this prisoner... your brother.
Forgive?!
Forgive?!
Aramis, Porthos and Athos too. I know what they have done was a threat against you -- and yet that threat has been removed, with no harm coming to your Majesty. If their passions were in error, their spirits have ever been noble. Forgive them.

Where is Michelle?
There.
Continue.
Sire, we have an emergency -- of security. I must ask you to accompany me.

... The ball... Continue.
... The ball... Continue.
I must insist, Sire.
Wait. Bargain me to Louis, for all your lives. You have done your best. Let me go, and let all of you find peace.
No. Even if I could give up my friends, I could never give up my son.
Phillippe!
I am unhurt --
You dead yet?
No, Keeper.
Food, moron.
Thank you, Keeper.
What number did you tear out?
Eh?
Eh?
What number, on the first page?
What number, on the first page?
... Two-thirty-seven.
... Two-thirty-seven.
Two-thirty-seven: "... And the descendants of Japeth are these: Obediah, Zebulon, Hezekiah..."
You've... memorized...?
What was the end page?
I would not have disturbed you, Majesty, but you ordered me to keep you informed --
Yes, yes, go on.
Yes, yes, go on.
Athos, the former Musketeer, has just fought with several of your guard, at the Musketeers' Gate.
Did they kill him?
No. He cut an ear from one of the men, no one else was hurt. Captain d'Artagnan allowed him to leave. Athos was upset about the death of his son, at the front.
Who was Athos seeking? Tell me! Did he try to enter the palace?
... He did -- but Captain d'Artagnan blocked his way.
... He did -- but Captain d'Artagnan blocked his way.
You may go, Lieutenant.
Do you want Athos arrested, your Majesty?
Not by you. I will order d'Artagnan to do it.
Now. Where is d'Artagnan?
Out directing the search for the traitors.
Out directing the search for the traitors.
When he returns, watch him. When he leaves again, you tell me.
Cowards! Twenty run from four?!
The corridor nullifies our number... And no one has stomach to fight the Captain.
Magnificent valor...
Shoot them! Shoot them!
Riots? My people live in the world's most beautiful city, their king has the grandest palaces on earth. Why should they feel anything but pride and contentment?
Well yes, of course, Majesty, and I'm sure they are content... except that... well, they are starving.
Well yes, of course, Majesty, and I'm sure they are content... except that... well, they are starving.
Sometimes the poor do grow hungry. But why would they riot about it?
Majesty... We have more than enough food set aside for your birthday celebration next week. If we distributed some of that, we would have time to gather more before --
Aramis! I have been expecting you! We are satisfied, that will do.
Ah yes, the riots. We have food stocks on the wharves right now, no?
That food has spoiled. That is why it was not shipped to the army.
That food has spoiled. That is why it was not shipped to the army.
Exactly why it should be given away.

What... an excellent idea, your Majesty!
I would have said it was impossible, but I believe the excitement of the chase has made you even more beautiful.
Sire, I --
Sire, I --
You blush! You do not wish to be beautiful to your King?
Sire! I -- How did you --
How did I get in? You're new here, and will soon learn many secrets. What is that?
How did I get in? You're new here, and will soon learn many secrets. What is that?
... Nothing.
... Nothing.
A letter. May I see?
From Raoul. He urges you to guard your honor -- as if it could be in any danger... from your king.
Raoul... is in love...
Raoul... is in love...
Enough of this, our dinner waits.
The food doesn't please you?
It's lovely. It's just...
It's lovely. It's just...
This is more than you are used to. Your mother is a seamstress, your father is dead. You have three younger sisters, two of whom suffer from consumption. Don't look so surprised, Kings know such things.

I... we are humble people...

Wait, no! Do not be ashamed. The straits of your family need not be permanent. It is a simple matter to have them brought to one of my country estates, where they may have fine meals, and physicians to look after them.

My dear, I've already done it.
You are beautiful. You know you are.
Sire, I --
Sire, I --
If you don't want to be so appealing, why did you touch the rose to your skin? Where was it? Here?
Shall I leave?
No, you may wait behind the screen.
Did you know... about Raoul?
I did not want to upset you. It was tragic. I did everything I could for him. I ordered him positioned in a spot of complete safety, far from the fighting. But he disregarded my wishes and charged into danger.
I will order a Mass for his soul. It will guarantee his place in Heaven.
Oh Louis, Louis...
Raoul... Oh, Raoul...
Listen, my darling... Raoul was a... a good friend. And now he is dead and that is very sad but --
Listen, my darling... Raoul was a... a good friend. And now he is dead and that is very sad but --
We'll burn in hell. Both of us.
Captain Doyle?
Yeah?
What can I do for you?
Your department contacted our agency regarding information on Sarah Williams.
Your department contacted our agency regarding information on Sarah Williams.
Yeah - I heard - nothing came up.
We did a little digging on Jim Trudell at Sergeant Zydowski's request. He's 31, no priors, and he's been working for the military for ten years.
We ran the i.d. I could have told you that.
We ran the i.d. I could have told you that.
I don't think you understand. I don't mean shuffling papers in an office, I mean Jim Trudell worked classified assignments, special forces...sabotage...until last year. He was brought up on charges of espionage, but the charges were later dropped, and he sprang the service.

Yeah?..well what are you getting at? You saying he has an agenda down here?
Yeah?..well what are you getting at? You saying he has an agenda down here?
Our agency monitors all threats very carefully, and there's good reason to believe Jim Trudell has the training, the connections, and the experience to present a clear threat to the public if he remains at large.

If what you're saying is true, then why would he have killed two police officers? A man like that would want to lay low, if he was planning some kind of damn sabotage mission!
If what you're saying is true, then why would he have killed two police officers? A man like that would want to lay low, if he was planning some kind of damn sabotage mission!
That's the point. He slipped up, and he's desperate now. And that means he's all the more dangerous.
I'm sure if our departments cooperate we can find out the truth.
Cooperate?
Cooperate?
Every step of the way.
Every step of the way.
If you guys want in, fine. Just remember this is our jurisdiction.
Alright, we know who we're looking for. Play it cool until the time is right to make a move. Let's not pull any gangbusters shit or we'll lose him again.
Or worse, we'll have a hostage situation on our hands.
You mind if I ride with you?
Yeah, stick around, you might learn something.
It's Marvosa -
What do you need?
What do you need?
The shit just hit the fan, brother. That bitch has a partner and he got away from me.
He walked in on Fleming and took him out.
So what?

So what is they have enough to shut us down!

You mean shut your ass down!

Bullshit...
Did you report it stolen?
You can cut the shit, asshole--
we've got kidnapping, grand theft auto, burglary, and two counts of murder on you, and I'm gonna see to it personally that it sticks!
What the hell happened?
He busted the back window with his feet, and fled on foot. We pursued him into this warehouse - but he's - gone, south - maybe a couple of miles if he's fast -

Why didn't you call for back-up! What were you thinking, Jesus!!!
It happened too fast. He was in the back, quiet and calm and boom! He was out - and gone. We...we fanned out...Stanton must have let his guard down!
I don't know how you're used to doing things, Marvosa, but it sounds like some damn sloppy work to me!
Oh for Chrissakes it could have happened to anyone of--
What the hell is this Marvosa!!
He must have got the keys... off Stanton.
He must have got the keys... off Stanton.
Great. Well that changes a lot...
I'm going to look for him on my own. Fuck this.
We're all gonna fan out! C'mon, let's do a sweep of the alleys -
Don't take any chances. Call for back-up this time!
Don't worry -
Did you hit him?
I didn't hit shit!
What did the six-toes have to say?
Sarah Williams left the bar with Trudell on her own.

Find out for me.
Fine...
Let's roll -
Right behind you.
If you can trail him to a remote area do it. We all want a piece of him but let's keep our heads and stay within the law - we got people everywhere out here.
These crowds are going to make it a bitch!
These crowds are going to make it a bitch!
I'm sure you can handle it. Now I want to do an alley-to alley sweep beginning at the north and south ends from Marine to 30th. Foot beat units continue on the boardwalk.

It's kind of a funny coincidence, isn't it?
Gotta come from somewhere...
Gotta come from somewhere...
Where do you come from, Marvosa?
Just wondering if maybe they had a thing going with this hooker, you know, some connection.
Hey what they did on their time was their business, you know? I just want to catch this scumbag, wherever he is.
Outside hacker? What the fuck are you talking about?
That's got to our secret agent man! Do we have an address?
Something wrong with you Marvosa?
It's just...catching up with me, you know?
It's just...catching up with me, you know?
Well why don't you sit this one and get some rest...you look like shit. CUT TO INT TUBBS' APARTMENT - NIGHT
Alright, where is she?
And who are you?
And who are you?
Who am I? I'm gonna be your worst fucking nightmare until you start breaking it down for me. You understand? Where did you get the car!
Who am I? I'm gonna be your worst fucking nightmare until you start breaking it down for me. You understand? Where did you get the car!
I'm done talking until I get a lawyer.
Anyhow... you wake up and she's gone. But-- --this is my favorite part-- she leaves you the keys to a brand new Beemer.
She stole my car!!
So... to get the car back, you break into her house.
I didn't break in - the back door was open!
I didn't break in - the back door was open!
Yeah, it was opened - with a goddamn screwdriver!!!
Are you alright?
I'll live...
I tell you one thing Trudell - you'd make a hell of a cop...
It wasn't in the cards.
The guy was looking for trouble, shoving people around, being an asshole...
And he took a swing at you?

Yeah...the guy was psycho - I was just tying to protect the girl...

Mm-hmm...that's not what the bartender told us.
Now you listen to me hay-seed! If you don't want to spend a year in jail for making a false report you'll start giving me straight answers, you got that!!
Alright, alright! We were just fucking with him..you know?
I was just having a little fun -
And what did he do to the girl?
And what did he do to the girl?
Nothing! He didn't do nothing!
Zydowski. It's about time.
You won't like this. I ran the prints from the house. No police record on your suspect--at least not in our files. But there is a match on the girl.

That's great Zydowski, you tech guys are really on the ball. Harding - call the print lab at the FBI, run the prints through their library, see if it's less screwed-up than ours...
Did you read today's paper?
No Zydowski I didn't read today's paper - it's just going to irritate the hell out of me.
No Zydowski I didn't read today's paper - it's just going to irritate the hell out of me.
Well read this -
Something I don't already know?
Well it's just kind of a coincidence, isn't it? Stanton and Fleming, both started in '83, both in area six...both in Vice?
Vice...you think they had something to do with this dead hooker?
Could explain why Fleming was there.
And where the hell is Marvosa?
He said he was following up some lead.
He said he was following up some lead.
Well let's get his ass to the garage! Some lead...
Captain there's someone here to see you - he's waiting in your office.
Who is it?
Who is it?
I don't know - but he's from the FBI.
Where is he?!!
I lost him - I heard shots - that way!!
Speak of the devil.
They found the getaway Mercedes a parking garage north of Venice. It checks out.

Good! We'll get it to the nearest outlying station and hold it for prints - we're on our way - You coming?
Captain?
Yeah?
Yeah?
LAPD data center reports a breach on the system. An outside hacker has accessed files on Detectives Fleming and Stanton...and yours too, Marvosa.
So where are you from?
Up north.
Up north.
Where up north?
Where up north?
Seattle.
Seattle.
You got any family?
No...
You're the mysterious type, right?
Mind if I turn out the light?
No...
You know, you don't seem afraid of much either. How do you know I'm not going to try to rape you?
Figure you would have tried it already.
You always carry a gun with you?
No.
No.
Only on dates?
What's going on here?
You'll find out - soon enough.
Why did you set me up?
I didn't. I figured you leave it well enough alone.
I didn't. I figured you leave it well enough alone.
Well you figured wrong! And now I'm public enemy number one. You have an answer for that?

Didn't these - professionals - figure he had a girl in the room?
Yeah...they did. One girl...
And what did you do?
I got out of there. I just grabbed up my stuff, and then I found it.

Found what?
I had it all on tape...
What did you do then?
What did you do then?
I didn't know what to do - but I knew I had something somebody would want. That's where I met him - told him what I had. The FBI set me up with a new place...but the cops found me somehow. So I ran...and met you.

So you know about Marvosa, and Stanton, and all of them.
There's something I've been meaning to ask you, Stephanie.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Where the hell is my car?
Have you ever heard of the Live Oak River?
No -
No -
Neither did I. I'll make it up to you, I promise...
What?
Jim Trudell! Bravo company!
Tubbs, it's me.
Well where are ya, what are ya, drunk?

Well...whatsamatter? Run in with the law?
Well...whatsamatter? Run in with the law?

You are drunk. You know, it's been a long time and I'd love to catch up, but I really got to -
Tubbs listen! I don't know anywhere else to go! I need your help!
Tubbs listen! I don't know anywhere else to go! I need your help!
Just what did you get yourself into, Jimmy?

It's...it's a long story. Can we meet somewhere?

Jesus, man...
Jesus, man...
Please...
Operator, I'd like to make a collect call - 213-467-0972...
This is Tubbs. Sorry I can't answer the phone, I'm out square dancing. Leave a message--
Holy shit -
Hello Tubbs. Can I come in?
Hello Tubbs. Can I come in?
Yeah, c'mon in...you scared the hell out of me!
No...
Look, Jimmy, you know, I haven't seen you in eight years, you show up to my door like you're on drugs - now the least you could do is tell me what the fuck is going on!
And?...
I killed them.
I killed them.
Oh, shit, shit, shit - I don't know about all this! You sure?!
Oh, shit, shit, shit - I don't know about all this! You sure?!
Yeah I'm sure! I did it with my own hands!
Jimmy, do you realize what you did? Man that's like death penalty shit -
It was self-defense, Tubbs! They're dirty! I walked in on something, I don't know what -

I have nowhere else to go, Tubbs, I need your help!
Oh man...what happened?
I don't know. But I'm in trouble. I'm all over the papers. I have to figure out what's going on.
I don't know. But I'm in trouble. I'm all over the papers. I have to figure out what's going on.
Alright...alright...you've saved my ass enough times. What do you want to do?
I hope you haven't lost your touch with this stuff.
Shit, what I have now made our setup in Angola look like Tinker Toys. I've been skipping through Internal Revenue records all day. I even have video strip poker. You want to check it out?
I've got a better idea...
OK...where do you want to start?
OK, I'm logged on to the municipal network. I'm showing sixteen people with the name Sarah Williams in L.A. county. None of them live in Hollywood. Do you remember the address?
1490...Breckinridge...
1490...Breckinridge...
Let's see what we got...
Donut?
No thanks. How do you know they can't catch you on this thing?
No thanks. How do you know they can't catch you on this thing?
I don't, but I'm pretty sure. It's a long story but I cloned a cellular linkup with a binary code scrambler and sent it through the phone network mainframe. If they start a trace it will be to a Pic'n'Save on Pico.

I knew I could count on you.
I got a lot of free time, you know what I mean?
OK...county tax records...they're saying 1490 Breckinridge is owned by... an Atlantic Trust Corporation...they have a P.O. box in D.C.
How about Marvosa and the others?
How about Marvosa and the others?
I'll access the LAPD mainframe, but we gotta be careful - that one's kind of tricky -
So...what happened to you, Jimmy? I figure you'd be in some far off place somewhere, living on the edge like the good old days.
I gave all that up. I got tired of the lies. They wanted to stuff me in Levenworth to cover their asses on a botched assignment. It got so I didn't know who to trust anymore... ...some things never change, I guess.
You know this time, there's nobody that's gonna cover your ass. You're over your head this time.
What else is new?
OK...Marvosa makes calls to this fax number overseas. And that's Switzerland's country code.
A bank?
A bank?
Who knows? Maybe he's ordering army knives. I can't access that, but look what we have here...these are the account records for Fleming and Marvosa.

Both at the same bank...

And look at the balances...these aren't police salaries...
Ahh, shit. We're pretty much tapped out. I'm getting denied access all over the place...
It's not very much to go on...is there anything else we can check?
It's not very much to go on...is there anything else we can check?
Shit, we just started. But I better log out of this.
That was her - the girl... We have to go.
I'm not going anywhere!
I'm not going anywhere!
Tubbs, these people mean business.
Tubbs, these people mean business.
I told you I'm not going anywhere! I got my whole life in this place! I'll just destroy the evidence and play dumb.
I can't help you anymore, Jimmy. I'm sorry.
I'm going to need a way to get there.
Are you going to be alright?
Don't worry about me... ...and don't forget your helmet. You don't want to get a ticket.
Where are you going?
Well I've kind of had my fill of the place, you know what I mean?

Bartender said there are motels south of here.
What would your - boyfriend - think?
Screw him!
You don't seem afraid of much.
Not with this...
No - that's not it! She said her boyfriend stranded her up there! I didn't ask her to come with me!
Did you have sex with her?

Then what did you do, play canasta?
Where am I going?
County jail - get in.
Don't you guys ever knock?
Where is he?
Where is he?
Long gone... MARVOSA Well you won't mind if I don't take your word for it, right?
Long gone, huh?
I asked him not to tell me where he was going. I told him I don't want any part of it.

He's an eideteker. He has almost total recall. But I don't think he's psychic. What he has it empathy and projection. He can assume your point of view and mine.., and some other points of view that scare and sicken him.

That's when it happened?
That's when it happened?
No. It happened when Graham went to see Hobbs' daughter four months later in the hospital. She saved her carotid artery.., but lost three fingers and her larynx. She was connected up to a voice box. When Graham went to see her, she asked him -- through the speaker: 'Why did you have to kill my daddy?' That's when Graham had his nervous breakdown.

If the Tooth Fairy listens to Lecktor, he'll come for me. So we're going to set me up as bait to draw him out. Give him a clean shot. That's what you were thinking, isn't it?
What have we missed?
He may have an unconscious homosexual conflict. A fear of being gay. He objects to the word 'fairy.' Plus smeared bloodstains indicate that he put the shorts on Charles Leeds after he was dead. I believe he did this to emphasize his lack of interest in Mr. Leeds.
Sidney: I don't understand him. We know he re-arranges the kids and husbands into a dead audience. To witness the act. We know he thinks the act is making him into something different. His 'becoming'... but I don't know what it is he thinks he's becoming. The answer is something to do with how he uses the mirrors. That's what's missing for me. Why
The usual motivation doesn't apply to him, nor the way he uses them. I don't have an answer for you. Listen to me, my friend: leave this.

Kevin and Molly are on their way to Montana. Who the hell is he to do this to my family, Sidney? Answer me that...!
The main thing is: how was Lecktor to reply.
That's probably in the part Lecktor tore out. At the top it says: 'I hope we can correspond.' And then the hole begins. It looks like Lecktor went over it with a felt tip pen and then folded it and pinched most of it away.

Then the Tooth Fairy named the book in the part Lecktor tore out.
Right. What about sweating Lecktor?

How long do I have?
Twenty minutes max.
Aniline dyes in the inks in felt-tip pens -- which is what Lecktor has -- are transparent to infrared. The Tooth Fairy's ballpoint isn't...
That could be the tip of a 't. Here and here. And here.

The Chicago office is running through all the personal ads in the Tattler right now.
When do they go to press?
If there's any doubt, we matched the indents of the bitemark on the note against the Smithsonian teeth. This is your boy... He folded the bottom part, including what Lecktor tore out. In this enlargement of the back side, oblique light revealed impressions. We can make out: 'six-six-six'. I didn't spot it until I had this high-contrast print. I advised Chicago as soon as
Issue the toilet paper tear as a...
No. The numbers aren't right for a jailhouse alphabet code. It's a book code. And your message has to go out in it, or he'll know it's not Lecktor talking to him.
Book code?

'One hundred prayers' could be the page number. The paired numbers and the scriptural references could be line and letter. But what book?

Not the Bible?
No. Galatians 15:2? Galatians has only six chapters. The same with Jonah 6:8 -- Jonah has four chapters. Lecktor wasn't using a Bible.

I need to talk to you about Will Graham.
I should have caught you at the boat yard when you got off work. You don't want to talk about it here...

Mrs. Leeds' fingernails and toenails. I think he took off his gloves, Jack. And dust all the corneas of all their eyes.
A cat. We found a litter box downstairs but not the cat. Neighbors are watching for it.
Why don't you get Birmingham P.D. a methane probe out of D.C. and have them cover the backyard... maybe the cat's dead and the kids buried it.
...snuck in the hospital while I was sedated, flipped back the sheets and shot pictures. The only decent thing he did was run a black square over my balls...
I know...
Atlanta and Birmingham can run the thumb print against known sex offenders. Five will get you ten they don't come up with an identification. Jimmie may in the Finder program... if he's ever been printed and in his Index.

We find an event that connects both families. Same vacation hotel; same hospital, different times. Then we check employees and come up with a male nurse, hairdresser, whatever... If we find out how he found them, then we'll find him.

We're running it through the computers now. So far there's no event or service that doubles back into both families. Plus they were big consumers: snowmobiles, fishing trips, scuba, videogames, lots of routine medical and dental. It's a haystack. What's the other?

What is it?
Sarah, order a chopper. I want the next thing smoking and I don't care whose. Ours. DCPD. Or the Marines. Then call Documents. Tell them to scramble a team. I want everybody moving in five minutes. Dr. Chilton, please do not handle the note. I have a Documents team on the way to you by helicopter to pick it up.
After we've worked the note we want to replace it in Lecktor's cell. I don't want him to know we found it. Where's Lector now?
We know the Tooth Fairy reads the Tattler. The stuff about me and Lector? I don't know any other paper that carried it...

Asian studies at Langley said the mark you found on the tree is a Chinese character considered a positive or a lucky sign in gambling. The character also appears on a mah- jongg piece. It means Red Dragon. That mean anything to you?

'Changes?'
'Changes?'
It's a word. Killing them... His delusion is: if he sees himself accepted enough times, he will become as one who has the power to be accepted all the time. And he would record it somehow. So he can see himself received over and over again...

There's some film cans in the far corner of the room underneath one of the windows.
What it's going to say on the Jacobi film can is the same as it says on the Leeds' film can: Gateway Lab, St. Louis, Missouri.
Is there a label on the Jacobi can that says what lab processed it?
No. It's Bob's Photo Store in...
Have him peel the top label back.

It'll do fine.
I'll take you.
No, thanks. I manage very well. I'll order you twelve hundred feet: of 1000 C tomorrow.
Ride with me.
Thanks, but I'll take the bus. I do it all the time.

How did you come to Gateway?
They had to shape up their employment practices to keep this defense contract.
You worked out well.
You know you speak very well, although you avoid fricatives and sibilants in your speech. At the Riker Institute for the Blind. I trained in speech therapy for speech and hearing impaired children...
I'll probably go back to it someday.
Uh-huh.
Ready to tell me what kind of 'outing' this is?
It's a surprise.
That was nice of you to think of that.
I made you a gin and tonic. It's by the side of the sofa...

The Tooth...
It's Dragon. Dragon... Red Dragon.
Francis did a thing for you today so I couldn't have you. And he was wrong. I AM THE DRAGON! Give me your hand.

Do you have it?
Yeah. It's right here.
Put it down on my desk blotter and don't touch it again. Has anyone else handled it except you?
No.
Dr. Lecktor will stay in his room. That is absolutely the only place where he is not put in full body restraints. One wall of his room is a double barrier. I will have a chair put just outside.

The consensus around here is that the only person who has demonstrated any practical understanding of Dr. Hannibal Lecktor is you, Mr. Graham. Can you tell me anything about him?
No.
No.
When you saw Dr. Lecktor's murders, their 'style,' so to speak, were you able to reconstruct his fantasies? And did that help you identify him?
I want to see Lecktor now.
Uh... sure...

That's all we know about. Most of the time in sex assaults the bite mark has a livid spot in the center. A suck mark. These don't. So, for him, biting may be a fighting pattern as much as sexual behavior. You could try emergency room personnel, treatment for bite wounds. I know that's pretty thin... He bites a lot.

Yeah. That's great. A little time. I tell you what, buckaroo... See you around.
Let's forget who said what to whom...
You got a deal...
It's Will Graham. Is Molly there, Mr. Swenson?
Well, how you doin', Mr. Graham?! You sure are in the center of a storm. Burning up lots of taxpayer's dollars, too, I bet. On the news they said he was a white man. He isn't really, is he?

With a knife. I found a curly piece of metal in the clothes of one of the girls. The kind of shred a pipe threader makes. I was taking a look at steam fitters, plumbers. It took a long time. In one place there was a resignation letter from a man named Hobbs. I saw it and it was..., peculiar. I was going up

Chilton? Gruesome, isn't he? He fumbles at your head like a freshman pulling at a panty girdle. He actually tries to give me a Thematic and Apperception test. Hah. Sat there waiting for MF-13 to come up. It's a card with a woman in bed and a man in the foreground. I was supposed to avoid a sexual interpretation. I laughed in his face.

Because, my dear Will, if this Pilgrim imagines he has a relationship with the full moon, he might go outside and look at it. Have you seen blood in moonlight, Will? It appears quite black. If one were nude, it would be better to have outdoor privacy for this sort of thing.

Goodbye, Dr. Lecktor. You can leave messages for me at the number on the file.
I wanted to congratulate you for the job you did on Mr. Lounds. I admired it enormously. What a cunning boy you are, Will.
What do you want?

When you were so depressed after you shot Mr. Garrett Jacob Hobbs to death, it wasn't the act that got you down. Didn't you really feel so bad because killing him felt so good? And why shouldn't it feel good?! It must feel good to God. God does it all the time!
I don't believe in God.
You should, Will. God's terrific! He dropped a church roof on thirty- four of His worshippers in Texas last Wednesday night. Just as they were groveling to Him and singing a hymn. Don't you think that felt good? He wouldn't begrudge you two measly murders.

Pretty well.

People love... comedians.
I'm not a comedian. I have no talent. I'm a song-and-dance man.
You show a lot of promise... but... my concern is I don't know where to book you. You're not a stand-up... your act doesn't exactly translate to films... help me... where do you see yourself?
I've always wanted to play Carnegie Hall.
Andy, c'mon IN! Thanks for flyin' out here!!
The stewardess let me keep my headphones.
The stewardess let me keep my headphones.
That's... terrific! But I got something better. This is BIG... You are getting a once-in-a- lifetime, unbelievably lucrative opportunity to star on... a PRIMETIME NETWORK SITCOM!!!!
Sitcom...?
And this is a CLASS ACT! It's the guys who did the Mary Tyler Moore and Bob Newhart shows! It takes place in a taxi stand! And you're gonna be the Fonzie!
And this is a CLASS ACT! It's the guys who did the Mary Tyler Moore and Bob Newhart shows! It takes place in a taxi stand! And you're gonna be the Fonzie!

George, I hate sitcoms.
George, I hate sitcoms.
HANG ON, you ain't heard the best part! ABC has seen your foreign man character, and they want to turn him into -- "Latka," a lovable, goofy mechanic!!!
No.
"No"? "No" to which part??
"No"? "No" to which part??
No to the whole thing. None of it sounds good.
Andy... this is every comedian's dream.
I told you, I'm not a comedian. And sitcoms are the lowest form of entertainment: Stupid jokes and canned laughter.

I'm not interested. I want to create my own material.
You have to do it.
I refuse.
I refuse.
LISTEN, you arrogant putz! I've been in this business for twenty years! I know! If you walk away from this opportunity, you will never, NEVER see another one like it again!!!!
Okay. Fine, I'll do it. But I have a few terms.
Of course! That's what negotiations are for.
Are you makin' fun of me --? This is RIDICULOUS!
Those are my terms.
Those are my terms.
They're IMPOSSIBLE!! Jesus! I mean -- "two guaranteed guest shots for Tony Clifton"??! Who is this TONY CLIFTON?!
They're IMPOSSIBLE!! Jesus! I mean -- "two guaranteed guest shots for Tony Clifton"??! Who is this TONY CLIFTON?!
He's a Vegas entertainer. I used to do impressions of him. We sorta... got in a fight over that.
Andy?
Hi George!
Hi George!
Eh, hi, Andy. Look, this Tony Clifton... is he performing anywhere?
Eh, hi, Andy. Look, this Tony Clifton... is he performing anywhere?
Of course. But only on Monday nights.
Of course. But only on Monday nights.
That's alright. Where...?
Andy!
What's up?
Look, I'm sorry. They're assholes! But we work in a creative business. You can't predict what people are gonna like --
The ONLY reason I did Taxi was so I could have my own Special!

Tell you what. I'll book you on some concerts, and meanwhile, we'll show the Special around... see if somebody wants to buy it --
Yeah, we can have a garage sale. "Hey look, I got a floor lamp and a network TV Special for only fifty cents!"
You signed for five years -- So four years, seven months.
Okay... I'll go back. But just let them know, first they ain't gettin' Latka. They're gettin' Tony!
I'm sorry, George...
You're DAMN RIGHT you're sorry! And you -- you're the road manager! You should be watchin' out for him!
When you play the Midwest and South, you DON'T MINDFUCK THESE PEOPLE! It's not postmodern -- it's rude. If you wanna perform in Texas, you give 'em Mighty Mouse! You give 'em Elvis!!
But George, I like to push the boundaries...
But George, I like to push the boundaries...
And that's great. But do it in LA and New York! There you experiment! Show up with a sleeping bag and take a nap on stage! I don't care!
How long would they let me sleep?
I don't know! Andy... you need to look inside: Who are you trying to entertain? The audience... or yourself?
Hi, George! Good to hear from you!
Hi, Andy. How's the weather up there?
Hi, Andy. How's the weather up there?
Oh, you know the Bay Area! Always foggy!
I'm here with Ed over at Taxi. There's been some trouble with Tony.
Oh no! Did he get hurt?
Oh dear! George, this is gonna kill Tony. He's waited his whole life for this break.
There'll be other shots.
You're so proud. You're like some retarded kid comin' home from school: "Look, Dad, I got an F!"
But wasn't it funny?
But wasn't it funny?
"Funny"? I dunno. But "intriguing"... "mindboggling"... perhaps "headache-inducing"... sure. Like, that moment, when you both came onstage...
George... I'm at a stage where the audience expects me to constantly shock them. But short of faking my death, or setting the theater on fire, I don't know what else to do. 'Cause I've always got to be one step ahead of them.
But I feel you're extending this philosophy to real life. It's obsessive. Nothing's ever on the level anymore.
That means it was a success. I woke up the audience -- like punk rock! Here, take this.
No, I'm not gonna take it. If I take it I'll break my back.
They're having a laugh...
WRONG! You haven't given them any clues that it's a parody!
WRONG! You haven't given them any clues that it's a parody!
That's because they've only seen it once. But I'll do it again, and again, and AGAIN... They'll catch on!
Andy, do you realize you don't do comedy anymore? Where's that sweet guy who used to do "Here I come to save the day!"? Please, enough with the wrestling! You've lost touch with reality!
What, you don't think I can beat him?
What, you don't think I can beat him?
He is the Southern Heavyweight Champion. He'll kill you. First, you piss-off women. Then you piss-off the South. Then you get killed! And I did the bookings.
We were just trying to push the envelope --
You're BLIND! There is no envelope anymore!! It hurts me to say this... but there's only one solution -- I don't want you two to ever work together again.
Maybe I can turn it into a bit. I can go back on the show, and say it was rigged. Demand a recount...
Andy! You don't get it! They don't want you back.
Hey! Our first phone call! Hello?
Andy... it's me. I've got some crummy news. Taxi's been canceled.
The world thinks Andy Kaufman sucks. So I was just giving 'em what they want...
Andy, they don't think you suck. They've just... lost a reason to love you.
No, it's true. I have lung cancer.
That's ridiculous. You don't even smoke.
That's ridiculous. You don't even smoke.
I -- I got some freaky rare kind. It's called large-celled carcinoma.
What was that all about?
It's visualization therapy. He's helping me turn inward and fight the disease.
You must take a little pleasure in it.
Of course! But that doesn't mean I don't need everyone's support! I can't be surrounded by negative energy.
Andy, you're surrounded by what you create. You are the KING of negative energy.
Y-yeah? Well, then it has to stop! Because if these bad vibes get out... then everyone will be talkin' about how sick I am, and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, and then -- I'm dead.
So how can I help you...?
I wanna go back to work and put on a happy show. The best show anybody's ever seen!
I wanna go back to work and put on a happy show. The best show anybody's ever seen!
Do you wanna tour the clubs?
Do you wanna tour the clubs?
No clubs. I wanna reach the TOP! Carnegie Hall...!
I don't care about the money. I just want the show to deliver.
So who's gonna pay for it?
So who's gonna pay for it?
Tony Clifton.
Tony Clifton.
You know Tony doesn't have that kind of money.
You know Tony doesn't have that kind of money.
Then he'll borrow it. I know Tony better than you do. Even if he has to work another ten years to pay it off, he'll do it!
I can't move my arm.
You've got good days and bad days.
My hair is coming out.
Yeah...
Did your -- doctor say it's okay for you to go back to work?
Ehhh, you know those guys. If he had his way, I'd be stuck in the hospital, running tests all day. And anyway, I've found a new guy who's gonna be able to instantly remove the cancer.
Ehhh, you know those guys. If he had his way, I'd be stuck in the hospital, running tests all day. And anyway, I've found a new guy who's gonna be able to instantly remove the cancer.
Really?
Really?
Yeah! He's a psychic surgeon in the Philippines, and he's amazing! He rubs you and sucks the disease right out!
So, Mr. Besserman, same slot tomorrow...?
Eh, I dunno... Andy. I'm... thinkin' of letting you go...
Eh, I dunno... Andy. I'm... thinkin' of letting you go...
You're firing me?? You don't even pay me!
You're firing me?? You don't even pay me!
Look -- I don't wanna seem insulting. But... your act is like amateur hour: Singalongs... puppets... playing records...
What do you want? "Take my wife, please"??
Sure! Comedy! Make jokes about the traffic. Do impressions. Maybe a little blue material...
Sure! Comedy! Make jokes about the traffic. Do impressions. Maybe a little blue material...
I don't swear. I -- I don't do what everyone else does!
I don't swear. I -- I don't do what everyone else does!
Well, everyone else gets this place cookin'! Pal, it's hard for me to move the booze when you're singin' "Pop Goes The Weasel."
Maybe I should talk to the natives. Shoom boom boo ba! Shoom boom boo ba --
Andy!
Andy!
Oh!
But I've got a sports show. Championship wrestling, at five.
You know that's not what I meant! Look, I'm gonna put my foot down! No more playing alone. You wanna perform, you GOTTA have an audience!
You know that's not what I meant! Look, I'm gonna put my foot down! No more playing alone. You wanna perform, you GOTTA have an audience!
B-but I have them.
B-but I have them.
No! That is NOT an audience! That is PLASTER! An audience is people made of flesh! They -- live and breathe! Got it?!
B-but... we saw... your neck...
Nah, it's phony baloney -- I faked the whole thing. It didn't hurt at all. It was just a yoga move. I tucked my head in.
B-but... we saw... your neck...
Nah, it's phony baloney -- I faked the whole thing. It didn't hurt at all. It was just a yoga move. I tucked my head in.
Andrew -- HOW DARE YOU!! For all we knew, you were DYING! Look at your mother -- she's still shaking!
But that's it. I needed you to believe! Our family will be in the newspapers. People will look, and they'll be touched. Because your emotions were honest!
Andy... we don't want the viewer to get out of their chair. They might change the channel.
But it's funny! It's a practical joke. They'll get frustrated!
Andy... uhh... this network has a long-standing policy: The viewer must be able to see the program.
But it's only for thirty seconds!
Five.
Twenty!
Twenty!
Ten.
Ten.
Deal.
Right...
Okay, great! So let's reset!
Cue the commercial!
These kinds of things go on everyday at the networks, only you never see it, because they cut to commercials. Now for sure they're gonna fire me, so if you want to see me again, you'll have to come to Memphis...
Excuse me -- ?
Do you wanna wrestle? It's a good way of breaking the ice. That instant physical intimacy really brings two people together.
What are you talking about?! We just met an hour ago.
No no no, it's not sex! I mean -- it can lead to sex... but really, it's just wrestling.
No no no, it's not sex! I mean -- it can lead to sex... but really, it's just wrestling.
I don't wanna talk about it!
What do you mean?
I mean -- uh -- the colors in the sky are so vibrant. I love this time of day.
I mean -- uh -- the colors in the sky are so vibrant. I love this time of day.
I've never understood that. It's just... getting dark. But I like you! Hey! Why don't we fill the car with gas, drive to Tijuana, and GET MARRIED???
Gosh, you scored! Look at all those goodies!
Buzz off. Go patronize somebody else.
Hey, I hope you didn't take that stuff I said seriously. It was just part of the show! It's like the old days, when a carnival barker would try to rile up the crowd.
Oh. So you were just pretending to be an asshole.
Hi...
Hi... am I late?
Hi... am I late?
No, I'm sure we'll be fine.
Popcorn?
No thanks.
No thanks.
I really want one. One large tub of popcorn, please, extra butter.
Andy, the theater's that way!
Hey, I love movie theater popcorn... but that doesn't mean I have to sit through "On Golden Pond."
Why did you call me? The last person I ever expected to get a call from was you.
Gosh. Gee, Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves. EXT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY

Gosh. Gee, Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves.
You were impressed with something. It's pretty odd when a man sports a hard-on that large on national television.
Oh! Uh, I hope I didn't offend you.
I'm here, ain't I?
Do you wanna to go to Memphis and get married?
Do I wanna go to Memphis and get married?
Do I wanna go to Memphis and get married?
Yes.
Why Memphis?
Because Memphis is the wrestling capital of the world! I'll go in the ring, and I'll announce that I will shave my head and marry any woman who beats me! Then you'll come up, we'll wrestle and I'll let you win! Then you'll scalp me, and we'll get married on Letterman, like Tiny Tim did on Carson... right there on the show! What do
And all this will be for real?
If you want...
Ooo, the little lady's upset. Well I say -- get back in the kitchen!
No! YOU get in the kitchen. I'm gonna make you dry my dishes!
Is this an act -- or are you addicted to causing trouble??
I can shtop whenever I want...
Then stop treating me like a fucking prop.
I-I'm sorry. I got caught up in the action...!
Go away.
It's me.
It's me.
Oh, it's open.
I brought you Haagen Dazs. Chocolate.
I don't deserve Haagen Daz. I'm a horrible person.
I don't deserve Haagen Daz. I'm a horrible person.
Andy, you're not horrible. You're just... complicated.
Andy, you're not horrible. You're just... complicated.
You don't know the real me.
You don't know the real me.
Andy... there is no real you.
Jesus, Andy! Can they cure it?
They don't know... they've gotta run more tests.
They don't know... they've gotta run more tests.
Have you told your family?
Have you told your family?
No, NO! Not yet. I feel bad -- I've jerked 'em around so many times.
How can you be so casual??!
Even if I'm dying -- I still need clean socks.
Even if I'm dying -- I still need clean socks.
You're NOT DYING!
You're NOT DYING!
Okay. You're probably right.
I'm not comfortable with the last sketch. I DON'T do drug humor!
Andy, it'll be fine! It's what we're known for! "Maui? "Wowie!"
Andy, it'll be fine! It's what we're known for! "Maui? "Wowie!"
You're not listening to me --
You're not listening to me --
Don't worry! The kids will love it --
Don't worry! The kids will love it --
But I don't do drugs! And I don't enjoy making light of them! I was promised creative control!
Go to commercial, man! Get off the stage!
I said I didn't want to do the sketch.
I said I didn't want to do the sketch.
GET OFF!
GET OFF!
DON'T TOUCH ME!
T-there wasn't a reason to purposely hurt me --
You're a wimp.
You're a wimp.
My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --!
My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --!
Then your father's a wimp.

And you're just poor white trash!

Hey Andy, good show.
Oh George, this is Bob Zmuda. Bob and I have been buddies for years.
I'm gonna quit.
What?!?
What?!?
Each show is worse than the next.
Each show is worse than the next.
Are you nuts?! 40 million people watch you every week!
Are you nuts?! 40 million people watch you every week!
So? What do they know?
So? What do they know?
Absolutely nothing! That's the beauty! It's credibility. You make them love you... and then later, on your special, you'll screw with their heads!
Give me the book.
No! Andy, don't do it --
No! Andy, don't do it --
They're asking for it.
I dunno about this... What will my mother think?
She'll say, "Now my son is a man."
She'll say, "Now my son is a man."
It's so dirty.
It's so dirty.
Nah. The girls sponge off between johns.
"Was this in actuality Andy Kaufman? And if it was Andy Kaufman, is Andy Kaufman crazy?"
Boy, they totally fell for it! I'm only acting crazy!
Look at this! An evil Russian! Ooo, here's an evil Nazi -- he likes to fight dirty! Hey, here's an evil Japanese guy!
What is this, World War Two...?
What is this, World War Two...?
You know, I always wanted to be a bad-guy wrestler...
You know, I always wanted to be a bad-guy wrestler...
No offense, pal, but I just don't think you're built for it. These he- men'll kick your ass!! They're huge!
"... has been rushed to a nearby hospital, where doctors are checking him for possible paralysis. His parents are at his bedside. Fans will best remember Kaufman as lovable Latka on television's Taxi"...
It's a rave! Boy, if I ever fake my death, they'll really miss me.
It's a rave! Boy, if I ever fake my death, they'll really miss me.
It's working for Elvis.
Sir, do you have a problem?
Yeah, my problem is you're tired.
I, I was asked to do this material - -
Sure, because your new stuff's a bunch of crap. Kaufman, people are sick of you. The wrestling... the hoaxes...
Sure, because your new stuff's a bunch of crap. Kaufman, people are sick of you. The wrestling... the hoaxes...
Hey -- that stuff gets written-up in the papers --
Hey -- that stuff gets written-up in the papers --
Who gives a shit?! It's not funny!
I was very original!
Yeah, exactly -- "was"! But now, you're creatively bankrupt. In fact, Ladies and Gentlemen, Kaufman's so desperate, he PAID me to do this tonight!! I'm a plant. It's just a fresh coat of paint on an old broken-down routine. Isn't that true???
This is great. The crowd's gonna love this! Hey... do you still think any of those cowgirls are still alive?
I dunno. If they were, they'd be pushin' 80.
I dunno. If they were, they'd be pushin' 80.
Well, call SAG. It'd be cool to get one on the show. I want the evening to build and build. It's gonna have the most incredible ending: Singers, dancers, the "Hallelujah Chorus" -- then the sky opens, and Santa Claus comes flying down!

And you say, "Santa, what am I gettin' for Christmas?" And he says, "Cancer!"
And you say, "Santa, what am I gettin' for Christmas?" And he says, "Cancer!"
No! NO NO NO! None of that! I want this show to be positive!
Are you at peace with your family?
Um, yes. I haven't fought with them, since I started here.
Um, yes. I haven't fought with them, since I started here.
Goals are important.

I stopped drinking. I gave up drugs. And I'm meditating three hours a day. It's the center of my life...
I stopped drinking. I gave up drugs. And I'm meditating three hours a day. It's the center of my life...
We are all impressed.
Excuse me, Andy...
Yes, your Holiness?
This is very difficult for me to say... but -- perhaps it would be best if you didn't attend the retreat.
Why?? I... I attend every year.
Why?? I... I attend every year.
Yes -- we do not doubt your devotion to TM. But we feel that perhaps... you and the program have grown apart philosophically.
"Philosophically"?
The wrestling... the sexist remarks... the foul language... these things are not becoming of an enlightened individual. It seems you have no respect for anything.
Please! You've GOT to let me take the classes! It's how I keep myself BALANCED!!
It is apparently not working.
It is apparently not working.
So HELP ME! All I wanna do is MEDITATE!!
So HELP ME! All I wanna do is MEDITATE!!
Andy, don't raise your voice. We don't wish your presence here.
I don't see any injury to your neck, Mr. Kaufman.
Are you sure?
Are you sure?
Positive.
Positive.
But my neck hurts... and I have a slight cough...
But my neck hurts... and I have a slight cough...
It's probably just a strained muscle.
It's probably just a strained muscle.
Doctor, I think I need a neck brace.
Ehh -- Andy doesn't really like playing casinos. The audiences don't work well for him.
Oh.
Really?! You want Tony Clifton to headline Harrah's Tahoe??
Eh, sure. We're trying to expand our audience base -- and I know the college kids really love Andy Kaufman.
Look -- I gotta be clear with you. Tony Clifton is NOT Andy Kaufman.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know! Wink wink! Nudge nudge!
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know! Wink wink! Nudge nudge!
No, I'm serious. If you book Tony, do NOT EXPECT TO GET ANDY.
No, I'm serious. If you book Tony, do NOT EXPECT TO GET ANDY.
I'll take my chances!!
Gene, you misunderstood!! You're not getting BOTH of them! It's physically impossible!
Why's that? You said over and over and over, Tony Clifton is not Andy Kaufman --
Why's that? You said over and over and over, Tony Clifton is not Andy Kaufman --
Yeah, I KNOW what I said! But -- trust me, it's not gonna happen!
Yeah, I KNOW what I said! But -- trust me, it's not gonna happen!
Sure it is. Tony called me himself. He yelled at me, insisting that his dressing room be bigger than Andy's. They're both going on tonight, believe me!
"Burlesque"?
Andy, I'm calling you up like this because I have the utmost respect for your artistry. But -- I need your permission to fire him.
We had a deal!!
I don't know what yer talkin' about. You musta talked to someone else --
I don't know what yer talkin' about. You musta talked to someone else --
Yeah!! I talked to Andy Kaufman!
Yeah!! I talked to Andy Kaufman!
I don't know nothin' about no Kaufman. He's been ridin' my coattails, smearing my reputation. Been usin' my good name, to get places.
Get off my stage! You're fired!
I GOT A CONTRACT!! I'm gonna take you to the DEPARTMENT OF LABOR!
Uh, yeah. Is this GEORGE SHAPIRO?
Er, yes. Speaking.
Er, yes. Speaking.
"Speaking"! Reeking, seeking, creaking... Freaking!
Can I help you with something?
Yeah! You stay away from that Andy Kaufman, if you know what's good for you!
Yeah! You stay away from that Andy Kaufman, if you know what's good for you!
Who is this? TONY CLIFTON You -- you know damn straight who it is. Tony Clifton! A name to respect. A name to fear. Beer. Gear. Deer. Ear.
Who is this? TONY CLIFTON You -- you know damn straight who it is. Tony Clifton! A name to respect. A name to fear. Beer. Gear. Deer. Ear.
Look... I don't know what your problem is...
Look... I don't know what your problem is...
Kaufman's a lying bastard! If you sign him, I'll RUIN YOU!
That was a really hot house!
So your name's not Gorsky.
So your name's not Gorsky.
Don't believe everything you hear.
I'm worried about Andy. His stress level is affecting his work.
Isn't Tony Clifton going on Taxi soon? Maybe that'll chill him out.
Isn't Tony Clifton going on Taxi soon? Maybe that'll chill him out.
Bob, Andy needs to RELAX. See if you can get him away from all this. Take him to Hawaii, or Bali... Find something special. Something nice...
So you've got this big elaborate joke, which is really only funny to two people in the universe. You... and you.
Sure! But WE think it's kickass! Now I get to be Tony. I get to dump the glass of water on someone else's head!
Sure! But WE think it's kickass! Now I get to be Tony. I get to dump the glass of water on someone else's head!
But what's the POINT? How will any of this make you the biggest star in the world?
Yeah, he's just laying low, waitin' for his comeback. God, listen to this! "It was morally wrong to take advantage of such an unstable individual..."
Wow, you can't BUY this kind of publicity!
Why...? Andy, why...?
I used to think you were original.
Hey, that's good! We can make that play. And we'll really drag it out. You get better, you get worse... you die...
FORGET IT. It's in terrible taste! I want nothing to do with this.
If I find out you're behind this, I'll kill you.
What are ya TALKIN' ABOUT?! I was the one saying I didn't believe it!
It's a perfect Kaufman audience.
Yeah. They don't know whether to be sad, or angry.
Is he in his room?
Of course he's in his room. All his "friends" are in there.
I saw Michael!
Where?
Where?
There!
Hmph! They sure didn't give Andy much to do.
He said he's coming back!
What's in Memphis?
Who knows?! That kid is totally meshuga.
Why is he saying these things?!
They're gonna lynch him!
JESUS CHRIST!!!!!
Why isn't he MOVING??
Sure...
What's your name?
What's your name?
Bob.
Bob.
"Bob"? BOB! Bob bob bob. Bob what?
"Bob"? BOB! Bob bob bob. Bob what?
Bob Gorsky.
Bob Gorsky.
"Gorsky"? What is that, Polish?
"Gorsky"? What is that, Polish?
Yes.
Are you tryin' to do some of that Polack humor? Well if that's so, you can just get the hell out of this restaurant!
It's my name.
It's my name.
SHUT UP! I hate them Polish jokes!
A -- a tourist.
See, that's EXACTLY what I'm talkin' about! Here! I'LL give you a little humor!
Then the informant is real.
Does that surprise you? It was inevitable.
Does that surprise you? It was inevitable.
He'll be contacting us again.
He'll be contacting us again.
Expect it. Did you get anything from the room?
Expect it. Did you get anything from the room?
Their next target. The name is Neo.
We'll need a search running.
It's already begun.
They are dead. In either case --
We have no choice but to continue as planned. Deploy the sentinels. Immediately.
You don't know.
Know what?
The sewers. Of course.
Hurry!
Hurry!
They won't make it.
The great Morpheus. We meet at last.
And you are?
And you are?
Smith. I am Agent Smith.
Smith. I am Agent Smith.
You all look the same to me.
Lieutenant?
Oh shit.
Oh shit.
Lieutenant, you were given specific orders --
Lieutenant, you were given specific orders --
I'm just doing my job. You gimme that Juris-my-dick-tion and you can cram it up your ass.
I'm just doing my job. You gimme that Juris-my-dick-tion and you can cram it up your ass.
The orders were for your protection.
I sent two units. They're bringing her down now.
No, Lieutenant, your men are already dead.
He's gonna make it.
No way. Not possible.
Weird.
What?
What?
That's the third white van I've seen.
That's the third white van I've seen.
Should Tank I.D. it?
What?!
Oh, God.
Who is it?
It's Choi.
You're two hours late.
I know. It's her fault.
You got the money?
Two grand.
Hallelujah! You are my savior, man! My own personal Jesus Christ!
If you get caught using that --
If you get caught using that --
I know, I know. This never happened. You don't exist.
I know, I know. This never happened. You don't exist.
Right...
Something wrong, man? You look a little whiter than usual.
I don't know... My computer...
You ever have the feeling that you're not sure if you're awake or still dreaming?
All the time. It's called mescaline and it is the only way to fly.
You weren't supposed to relieve me.
I know but I felt like taking a shift.
Don't be ridiculous.
We're going to kill him. Do you understand that? He's going to die just like the others.
We're going to kill him. Do you understand that? He's going to die just like the others.
Morpheus believes he is the One.
Do you?
I... it doesn't matter what I believe.
I... it doesn't matter what I believe.
You don't, do you?
You don't, do you?
If you have something to say, I suggest you say it to Morpheus.
If you have something to say, I suggest you say it to Morpheus.
I intend to, believe me. Someone has to.
Did you hear that?
Hear what?
Are you sure this line is clean?
Yeah, 'course I'm sure.
There's something about him, isn't there?
Don't tell me you're a believer now?
Don't tell me you're a believer now?
I just keep wondering if Morpheus is so sure, why doesn't he take him to the Oracle? She would know.
I just keep wondering if Morpheus is so sure, why doesn't he take him to the Oracle? She would know.
Morpheus will take him when he's ready.
Hello, Trinity.
Cypher? Where's Tank?
Cypher? Where's Tank?
He had an accident.
He had an accident.
An accident?!
You are a beautiful woman. Too bad things had to work out like this.
You killed them.
I'm tired, Trinity. I'm tired of this war, I'm tired of fighting. I'm tired of this ship, of being cold, of eating the same fucking goop every day. But most of all, I'm tired of this jagoff and all of his bullshit.
My God. Morpheus. You gave them Morpheus.
My God. Morpheus. You gave them Morpheus.
Yes. You see, the truth is, Trinity, that we humans have a place in the future. But it's not here. It's in the Matrix.
Yes. You see, the truth is, Trinity, that we humans have a place in the future. But it's not here. It's in the Matrix.
The Matrix isn't real!
The Matrix isn't real!
Oh, I disagree, Trinity. I disagree. I think the Matrix is more real than this world. I mean, all I do is pull a plug here. But there, you watch a man die.
But you're out, Cypher. You can't go back.
That's what you think. They've promised to back me, Trinity. They're going to reinsert my body. I'll go back to sleep and when I wake up, I'll be fat and rich and I won't remember a goddamn thing. It's the American dream.
Goddamn you, Cypher!
Don't hate me, Trinity. I'm just the messenger. And right now I'm going to prove it to you.
... yes.
No!
I don't believe it! I don't believe it!
He's going to pop!
Whoa! Shit, Neo, you scared the Bejeezus out of me.
Sorry.
Sorry.
No, it's all right.
No, it's all right.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Midnight watch.
Is that...?
The Matrix? Yeah.
Do you always look at it encoded?
Have to. The image translators sort of work for the construct programs but there's way too much information to decode the Matrix. You get used to it, though. Your brain does the translating. I don't even see the code. All I see is blonde, brunette, and redhead. You want a drink?
Why you're here?
... Yeah.
... Yeah.
Gee-zus! What a mindfuck. You're here to save the world. You gotta be shitting me. What do you say to something like that?
I'm going to let you in on a little secret here. Now don't tell him I told you this, but this ain't the first time Morpheus thought he found the One.
Really?
Really?
You bet your ass. It keeps him going. Maybe it keeps all of us going.
You bet your ass. It keeps him going. Maybe it keeps all of us going.
How many were there?
How many were there?
Five. Since I've been here.
Five. Since I've been here.
What happened to them?
What happened to them?
Dead. All dead.
Dead. All dead.
How?
How?
Honestly. Morpheus. He got them all amped up believing in bullshit. I watched each of them take on an agent and I watched each of them die. Little piece of advice: you see an agent, you do what we do; run. Run your ass off.
Thanks... for the drink.
Any time.
Operator.
I need an exit! Fast!
I need an exit! Fast!
Cypher?
There was an accident. A fucking car accident. All of a sudden. Boom. Jesus, someone's going to make a believer out of me.
I got you.
I got you.
Just get me outta here.
Just get me outta here.
Nearest exit is Franklin and Erie. An old appliance store.
I know. They cut the hardline. This line is not a viable exit.
Are they any agent?
Are they any agent?
Yes.
Yes.
Goddamnit!
Goddamnit!
You have to focus. There is a phone. Wells and Lake. You can make it.
All right --
Go.
I got a fibrillation!
Shit! Apoc?
We found him, Trinity. We finally found him.
What if he isn't the One, Morpheus? How can you be so sure?
Give me your phone.
They'll be able to track it.
They'll be able to track it.
We have no choice.
What is he doing?
He's beginning to believe.
How long?
Five minutes. Maybe six.
You can't use that until Neo is out!
I know, Trinity. Don't worry. He's going to make it.
Hello?
Hello, Neo. Do you know who this is?
Morpheus...
I've been looking for you, Neo. I don't know if you're ready to see what I want to show you, but unfortunately, we have run out of time. They're coming for you, Neo. And I'm not sure what they're going to do.
I've been looking for you, Neo. I don't know if you're ready to see what I want to show you, but unfortunately, we have run out of time. They're coming for you, Neo. And I'm not sure what they're going to do.
Who's coming for me?
Who's coming for me?
Stand up and see for yourself.
Stand up and see for yourself.
Right now?
Right now?
Yes. Now.
Holy fucking shit!
Yes.
What the fuck do they want with me?!
I'm not sure, but if you don't want to find out, you better get out of there.
I'm not sure, but if you don't want to find out, you better get out of there.
How?!
How?!
I can guide you out, but you have to do exactly what I say.
The cubicle across from you is empty.
But what if...?
But what if...?
Go! Now!
Good. Now there is a window. Open it.
How do you know all this?
No! It's too far away.
There's a small ledge. It's a short climb. You can make it.
No way, no way, this is crazy.
There are only two ways out of this building. One is that scaffold. The other is in their custody. You take a chance either way. I leave it to you.
This line is tapped so I must be brief.
The agents --
The agents --
They got to you first, but they've underestimated how important you are. If they knew what I know, you would probably be dead.
They got to you first, but they've underestimated how important you are. If they knew what I know, you would probably be dead.
What do you know?
What do you know?
You're the One, Neo. You see, you may have spent the last few years looking for me, but I've spent most of my life looking for you.
Do you still want to meet?
... Yes.
... Yes.
Go the the Adams Street bridge.
Welcome, Neo. As you no doubt have guessed, I am Morpheus.
It's an honor.
It's an honor.
Please. Come. Sit.
I imagine, right now, you must be feeling a bit like Alice, tumbling down the rabbit hole?
You could say that.
You could say that.
I can see it in your eyes. You have the look of a man who accepts what he sees because he is expecting to wake up.
Ironically, this is not far from the truth. But I'm getting ahead of myself. Can you tell me, Neo, why are you here?
You're Morpheus, you're a legend. Most hackers would die to meet you.
You're Morpheus, you're a legend. Most hackers would die to meet you.
Yes. Thank you. But I think we both know there's more to it than that. Do you believe in fate, Neo?
Yes. Thank you. But I think we both know there's more to it than that. Do you believe in fate, Neo?
No.
No.
Why not?
Why not?
Because I don't like the idea that I'm not in control of my life.
Because I don't like the idea that I'm not in control of my life.
I know exactly what you mean.
Let me tell you why you are here. You have come because you know something. What you know you can't explain but you feel it. You've felt it your whole life, felt that something is wrong with the world. You don't know what, but it's there like a splinter in your mind, driving you mad. It is this feeling that brought you to me.
The Matrix?
The Matrix?
Do you want to know what it is?
The Matrix is everywhere, it's all around us, here even in this room. You can see it out your window or on your television. You feel it when you go to work, or go to church or pay your taxes. It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.
What truth?
What truth?
That you are a slave, Neo. Like everyone else, you were born into bondage, kept inside a prison that you cannot smell, taste, or touch. A prison for your mind.
The pill you took is part of a trace program. It's designed to disrupt your input/output carrier signal so we can pinpoint your location.
What does that mean?
Have you ever had a dream, Neo, that you were so sure was real?
This can't be...
This can't be...
Be what? Be real?
... am I dead?
Far from it.
What are you doing?
Your muscles have atrophied. We're rebuilding them.
Why do my eyes hurt?
You've never used them before.
Morpheus, what's happened to me? What is this place?
More important than what is when?
More important than what is when?
When?
When?
You believe the year is 1997 when in fact it is much closer to 2197. I can't say for certain what year it is because we honestly do not know.
Right now, we're inside a computer program?
Wild, isn't it?
This isn't real?
What is real? How do you define real? If you're talking about your senses, what you feel, taste, smell, or see, then all you're talking about are electrical signals interpreted by your brain.
We have only bits and pieces of information. What we know for certain is that, at some point in the early Twenty-first Century, all of mankind was united in celebration. Through the blinding inebriation of hubris, we marveled at our magnificence as we gave birth to A.I.
A.I.? You mean artificial intelligence?
A.I.? You mean artificial intelligence?
Yes. A singular consciousness that spawned an entire race of machines. I must say I find it almost funny to imagine the world slapping itself on the back, toasting the new age. I say almost funny.
No! I don't believe it! It's not possible!
I didn't say that it would be easy, Neo. I just said that it would be the truth.
Get some rest. You're going to need it.
For what?
For what?
Your training.
This is incredible. I know kung fu.
Show me.
How did I beat you?
You -- you're too fast.
You -- you're too fast.
Do you think my being faster, stronger has anything to do with my muscles in this place?
I know what you're trying to do --
I'm trying to free your mind, Neo, but all I can do is show you the door. You're the one that has to step through. Tank, load the jump program.
Do you know why you didn't make it?
Because... I didn't think I would?
I thought it wasn't real.
Your mind makes it real.
If you are killed in the Matrix, you die here?
The body cannot live without the mind.
This is another Matrix simulation. A training program to help you get your sea legs and teach you one very important lesson.
What -- what lesson?
Do you understand, Neo?
I think I do.
I think I do.
No you don't. Did you see the woman in the red dress?
No you don't. Did you see the woman in the red dress?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Look again.
Every attempt to fight them has ended in failure. Only a handful of men and women have ever crossed an agent and lived because they are everyone and they are no one. Unkillable. But now I believe that is going to change.
How?
How?
I've seen an agent punch through a concrete wall. Men have emptied entire clips at them and hit noting but air. Yet as powerful as they are, their speed and strength are but tethers to the rules of an unreal world. Because of this, they will never be as strong or as fast as you can be.
What? Are you trying to tell me that I can dodge bullets?
No, Neo. I'm trying to tell you that when you're ready, you won't have to.
Set down in there.
What's going on?
So is this the same oracle that made the, uh, prophecy?
Yes. She's very old. She's been with us since the beginning.
Yes. She's very old. She's been with us since the beginning.
The beginning?
The beginning?
Of the Resistance.
Of the Resistance.
And she knows what? Everything?
And she knows what? Everything?
She would say she knows enough.
She would say she knows enough.
How does she know?
How does she know?
She is a true psychic. She sees beyond the relativity of time. For her there is no past, present or future. There is only what is.
