It was for suspicion of bribery, it's really all in the wording --
Wording and your friendship with the Colonel aside, I'm not comfortable having you involved in this.
Wording and your friendship with the Colonel aside, I'm not comfortable having you involved in this.
Subtlety really isn't one of you finer points, is it, Osborne?
Three things. First -- You don't have a choice. Second -- I've never taken a bribe in my life. And Third -- I'm still a little drunk from last night, so if I skip over the witty banter and move forward to straight hitting on you, try not to take offense. Tell me about the two guys.

He's in interrogation?
He's in interrogation?
Yes.
Yes.
Move him.
Move him.
Why?
Why?
Because interrogation rooms look suspiciously like interrogation rooms, which doesn't exactly put people at ease. Is he cute?

That is the most unprofessional --
That is the most unprofessional --
Is he handsome, self assured, carry himself well, does he look you in the eyes or down at the floor, does he have good bones, suggesting good breeding, does he slouch or sit up straight -- these are important questions, as they reveal a great deal about this man's character so please get over yourself for two and a half seconds and tell me
Thank you. At some point in there I'm gonna rub my nose. When I do, go at him with everything you got.
Good cop/bad cop?
Good cop/bad cop?
Something like that.
I questioned him for three hours and he didn't make a sound. You don't have a badge, he won't talk to you.
Ten bucks says I have him talking in under three minutes.
The Colonel saw you shoot Nunez, you're a murderer --
See, Ray, this is what we call "good cop, bad cop". She shouts, I stand up for you, you're grateful, a bond of trust is established.
Baseball?
I believe somebody owes me ten dollars --

You made me look like an idiot --

Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know the object of the interrogation is to make you look good -- Everyone knows good cop, bad cop -- by admitting it I appeared trustworthy.
You really want to make banal chit- chat like that now?
You're right. We should sit in silence.

We're in the middle of a murder case --

Best time for banal chit-chat.
What is that?
Microrecorder for Kendall -- didn't have time to wire his room. Now tell me why you joined the army or I'll jab this pen through your neck.
Typical army brat story. Dad was noncom, Mom was a Nurse. There was never any real doubt of joining up.
You had a mobile of bayonets above your crib.

Something like that. You?

I lost a bet.
You're kidding.
Yeah. That's just the story I tell the girls to get them into bed. Truth is... I don't know. The whole honor and duty thing. Make a difference in the world, crap like that. Didn't really work out.
This is the straight hitting on me you were talking about, isn't it?
The very same.
The very same.
You do understand that there's absolutely no way I could ever be attracted to you, right?

So noted.
You guys really got the shit kicked out of you here.
Imagine what it must have been like for them out there. What do you think of Dunbar?

He's telling the truth, up to a point.

Being back here. Gives me the willies.
Being back here. Gives me the willies.
Not the happiest of memories?
Remember, he's the son of a Senator, so go easy. Kid gloves.
Got it.
That was kid gloves?
Have no fear, Osborne, we have not yet begun to fight.
But we have to question him -- Thought you didn't have cigarettes --
I lied. Wait for it...
"Too neat." How long have you been an investigator?
I don't think that has anything to do with --
I don't think that has anything to do with --
That means under a year. Let me explain what ten years of police work has taught me -- murder is basic. There are no conspiracies, no grand mysteries, and no evil puppet masters behind it all, pulling the strings; murder is shitty people doing a shitty thing to other shitty people -- it doesn't always make sense but it's always neat. Dunbar's our guy.
I just... He came back for Kendall. I don't think he's capable of murder.
Everyone's capable of murder, Osborne.
Look, all we've got is what Kendall says, and he didn't actually witness any deaths except Nunez. He found West, he saw Mueller and Pike, but just their bodies -- he didn't see any crime committed.
Well, I'm sure if he'd known this was all going to happen he'd have tried harder to witness it for you --
Why the fuck wasn't he in restraints?
I don't know.
Styles couldn't reassign him, he's a legend --
You knew what he was capable of and you just stood by. It was just a matter of time till somebody fragged his ass, and you know what? He deserved it. There's your confession.
Goddammit, Hardy, you can't just leave --
Watch me.
Watch me.
You said you owed Styles and now you're gonna turn your back on him?
West was a monster! Fifteen years ago, I was here, I was Section Eight, I was Pike. Fuck being the knife dummy -- that thing he did, stripping Pike down, making him stand outside all night? He did that every year, he did that to me. Fifteen years ago, I wanted him dead, and now I'm supposed to care that somebody offed him? Sorry,
You did more than try. You cracked Dunbar in less than three minutes, as an investigator you're phenomenal --
You did more than try. You cracked Dunbar in less than three minutes, as an investigator you're phenomenal --
Phenomenal at taking bribes, right?
I was starting to believe you, you know? That you weren't who everyone said. I guess I was wrong --
Oh, spare me the reverse psychology bullshit! This isn't my "great second chance", Osborne. Everyone thinks I'm a piece of shit cop who took money and nothing is going to change that. Nobody will ever know what happens here --
Oh, spare me the reverse psychology bullshit! This isn't my "great second chance", Osborne. Everyone thinks I'm a piece of shit cop who took money and nothing is going to change that. Nobody will ever know what happens here --
But you will.
Why do you care?
Because it's my job. Because people are dead. Because of the whole honor and duty thing, make a difference in the world, crap like that. We can do this, Hardy.
I didn't shoot West...
What?
What?
Dunbar... He said he didn't shoot West. West wasn't shot, Kendall said he was blown apart by a phosphorous grenade and Dunbar never saw the body.
At least you and Kendall agree on that.
What happened next?
Talk it through: Childs, Mueller, and Nunez know they're going out on the regular Tuesday Night drill, hurricane or no hurricane, so they plan it: Kill West, pin it on Pike.
And they're smart about it. They know when you commit a crime you know is going to be investigated, you need a fall guy and for that to work, you have to have a witness.

Dunbar.
Dunbar.
Exactly, someone who's not involved, who's word can't be questioned. You only let them see what you want them to see, you make them believe, so when the time comes, they've totally bought into your version of events.

So it's a good plan but it goes wrong; Mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy, which means they have to bring Dunbar and Kendall into the cover story --

So why, after Dunbar drags Kendall out from under a house, does the Senator's son try and get us to put his savior in the gas chamber?

Little bit.

Let's go talk to Bill...
We're fucked, I know --
They got their stories straight.
They got their stories straight.
What?
What?
What Kendall said -- "the type of guys you don't feel comfortable going to sleep around." That's what Dunbar said about Childs to the letter.

Are you sure?
Are you sure?
Positive. Hardy, they planned this.
Why don't you talk to Levi off the record for a second?
Good idea.
That's a fantastic idea --
See, I just take your gun to the morgue and fire it into one of their skulls; then I call every newspaper in the country with the story about how Senator Kendall's gay son went nuts on a training mission --
I pushed him too hard.
You couldn't have known --
You couldn't have known --
Yeah, I could've. Should've.
Yeah, I could've. Should've.
You wanted to get the truth.
You wanted to get the truth.
No, I didn't. I wanted to humiliate him. For what he did to Dunbar. For fucking over the little guy.
No, I didn't. I wanted to humiliate him. For what he did to Dunbar. For fucking over the little guy.
You mean the falsely accused?
You wanted to break him.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So did I.
So what now?
Now I go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
Now I go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
Think it'll work?

Nah.
You know, you never told me why you left the army.
It dawned on me one day that we were supposed to be a nation founded on the principle of questioning authority... and all I did here was follow orders. It didn't add up. Plus, I got kicked out.
It dawned on me one day that we were supposed to be a nation founded on the principle of questioning authority... and all I did here was follow orders. It didn't add up. Plus, I got kicked out.
For what?
For what?
That's gonna stay my secret.
We were close to something with Kendall.
Maybe... Maybe we were nowhere near. Sometimes mysteries stay mysteries. I haven't by any chance grown on you, have I?
Maybe... Maybe we were nowhere near. Sometimes mysteries stay mysteries. I haven't by any chance grown on you, have I?
No.
No.
Good, just making sure.
Four --
Get in.
We got maybe three minutes till they break it down.
Right back where we started.
Hardy, what are you doing --
Isn't this how your story goes?
We can tie you to the chair if it'll work better for you --
Hardy, for Chrissakes --
Hardy, for Chrissakes --
WHERE'S WEST'S BODY?
No bodies, no West...
No death certificates. No crime.
We need to talk --
Seven.
What?
Seven guys. What was it you said? You were "just starting to believe I wasn't the guy people said".
This isn't the time --
This is the perfect time. You know what makes a good detective? The number of confessions they get. You're a good detective, Osborne. So now you get mine.
This is the perfect time. You know what makes a good detective? The number of confessions they get. You're a good detective, Osborne. So now you get mine.
What if I don't want it?

Tough.
That's not true.
There are degrees of truth, officer. Always degrees.
There are degrees of truth, officer. Always degrees.
You're a good man, Hardy.
You're a good man, Hardy.
Really.
Really.
Far as I'm concerned, whatever you did in the past can stay in the past.
West?
Nobody saw. But I don't think so.
Do I have a choice in this?
Yeah. I can wait till you're off the base and do it myself.
What are you doing out here?
Leaving without saying goodbye. What are you gonna do?
Leaving without saying goodbye. What are you gonna do?
Go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.

Nah.
Want company?
A word of advice about women -- that first hour or so after they kill their boss? Probably not the best time to hit on them.
I should probably write that down.
I should probably write that down.
Yeah.
Your phone number?
In case you need me to testify about the shooting. They'll clear you.
He was your friend.
Yeah. But he was a lot of other things, too. Thanks.
The thing is, we've got a real opportunity here. You turn me in tomorrow and we're both fucked --
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
A gay Senator's son who let his Sarge get fragged on a training exercise? The press'll crucify you and your father. His career will be over and it'll be your fault. But we do this different and you come out a hero.
How?
Mueller. He's as bad as West and we both know it. Now I can't do it, cause I'm tied up, but we get the others to go along --
Mueller. He's as bad as West and we both know it. Now I can't do it, cause I'm tied up, but we get the others to go along --
I don't think I want to hear this --
I don't think I want to hear this --
Someone else can do the deed, it doesn't have to be you. Maybe Nunez too, he's got a tendency to follow Mueller, but the rest of us can come out ahead -- the guys who took out their Sergeant's killers! We'll move the bodies out to the creek and say we came over the hill right as they fragged West, all we gotta do
Pike, please --
Although that won't matter much when coupled with the murder charge --
Maybe we shouldn't go.
The faggot speaks.
The faggot speaks.
You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?
You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?
You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?
We should tell him we're not going.
Oh, yeah, "Excuse me, Sergeant, sir, we don't feel like going out -- we don't want to get rained on." He'll kick our asses from here to Cleveland.
They found him. Poor fucker was practically blown in half --
Poor fucker my ass...
Poor fucker my ass...
You better watch it, faggot, I'm not sure you and Childs didn't do him --
Pike and I got separated --
Yeah and he doesn't know when --
Yeah and he doesn't know when --
I remember now, it was before the explosion --
I remember now, it was before the explosion --
Oh, you remember now --
Oh, you remember now --
I'm about two seconds away from seeing if fairies really can fly --
I was freezing from the hurricane --
So you took off your shirt?
So you took off your shirt?
To start a fire, goddammit! What about him, huh? Maybe he offed the Sarge and changed shirts, brought an extra one in his pack. Y'ever think of that? Go ahead, cut him loose! First chance he gets, he'll waste the rest of us, that's how they work --
We just want --
What, "The Truth"? Please. There are degrees of truth, officer, always degrees. Things are not what they seem.
He couldn't kick you out so he wanted you to quit on your own.
He wanted more than that.
He said what?
"You're gonna die tonight, faggot". Clear as day.
"You're gonna die tonight, faggot". Clear as day.
No one else heard it?
No one else heard it?
He whispered it in my ear.
Nunez was chasing Dunbar.
Because he'd shot Mueller.
Because he'd shot Mueller.
But you didn't see it, right?
But you didn't see it, right?
Like I said, I was in the kitchen. When I came out, Mueller and Pike were dead, Nunez and Childs were hit and Dunbar was gone.
Pike never confessed.
We've been making progress, I see.
Running out of time, are we? Tick- tock, tick-tock, how long till your witnesses fly the coop?
Fifty minutes.
Fifty minutes.
Not much time to solve the crime. Tell me, detective, how did it feel taking blood money from Guissepe Torres? Did it weigh on your conscience or did you just not think about it?
Pike never confessed.
No, but it got you interested, didn't it? Got you to dig. Inspired Ray to tell you terribly sordid tales about drugs and creek beds and dead little sergeants who stuck their noses where they didn't belong.
Dunbar says you were.
Then he's mistaken. You know, I really don't think my father would approve of this line of questioning --
You and Dunbar got your stories straight. Little details, little inconsistencies, designed to bounce us back from one of you to the other, asking questions, killing time, until the transport arrives and whisks you away to where Senator Daddy can protect you. You think you're just going to slide out of this? You're an accessory to murder, Levi, you're going to jail --
You can't threaten me --
It doesn't matter, Levi. We're going to find those bodies and when we do, I'm going to make sure one of them has a bullet in them that matches your weapon --
What?
It won't work --
It will and you know why? Because you're not a person anymore, you're a cadet in the United States Army; you have no identity, no Miranda warning, and no rights. So I'm gonna throw you to the wolves, and unlike you, I'm gonna get away with it, because you're pissing me off!
Enjoy your flight to Washington --
Wait --
Wait --
What.
Dunbar's telling the truth.
Wrong answer --
Wrong answer --
We did get our stories straight, but not because we killed anyone. It was because I threatened him.
Who, Levi --
Childs.
I told him what had really happened to West. Told him to keep quiet about it or I'd destroy him. Because if it came out that I was involved with the whole PX scam, my father would be finished.
I scared Dunbar into silence. He's been trying to cover for me the whole time. We got here, you came to see me... I didn't know if I could trust him with that kind of secret --
I scared Dunbar into silence. He's been trying to cover for me the whole time. We got here, you came to see me... I didn't know if I could trust him with that kind of secret --
So you framed him. The same way Childs was going to frame Pike.
What happened with Nunez?
He came after us. And I told Dunbar he had to kill him...
Hurricane's due after midnight and we're still going out?
Toughens us up, Pike. You don't like it, quit.
What the fuck happened to you --
What the fuck happened to you? One minute you're next to me and the next you're gone and the sky lights up like fucking Christmas --
Whoever shot the Sarge blew a grenade first --
Blame the nigger, then, huh? Someone turns up dead, you just look for the darkest face in the crowd --
Thank God...
What the fuck are you doing?
This place is going, Mueller. We gotta move --
Shut the fuck up. He was gonna cut him loose.
We all know what you did, Pike. I don't know what kind of nigger voodoo you been working in here, but --
Where's your shirt, Mueller?
Where's your shirt, Mueller?
I used it to start the fire --
I used it to start the fire --
Still got mine on, not a speck of blood on it. Not a bad trick for a murderer -- you said you burned yours?
Goddammit, Ray, we gotta get out of here --
We're not going anywhere.
Cadet Michael Mueller, I hereby place you under military arrest for the murder of Sergeant Nathan West --
The fuck are you talking about --
The fuck are you talking about --
You are to be stripped of all weapons and placed under guard --
You are to be stripped of all weapons and placed under guard --
Bullshit --
Bullshit --
Until we return to base, and ballistics can match your weapon to the slugs in Sergeant West's body --
Until we return to base, and ballistics can match your weapon to the slugs in Sergeant West's body --
Shut up!
Tell him to shut up --
-- failure to comply with this arrest is a court martialable offense in and of itself --
Sign here and here. Hey, ain't you the folks workin' on that whole hulabaloo from last night?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Terrible tragedy. One of those Section Eight boys worked in here. Pike. Heard he got out okay.
Funny. I swear I saw them bring him and the smaller guy in this morning.
No, no that was Cadet Dunbar --
No, no that was Cadet Dunbar --
You mean Ray Dunbar? Well, that ain't right.
So?
Ma'am, Ray Dunbar's black.
This is totally unnecessary --
He asked to see a policeman, we're getting him a policeman.
He asked to see a policeman, we're getting him a policeman.
But this guy you called, he's not even Army --
But this guy you called, he's not even Army --
He's former Army and the best I've ever seen in a room. Besides, he knows the territory, we did Basic together here. You've had three hours with Dunbar and haven't gotten a peep, we need to take a different tack.

He's not Army, it's not official --
He's not Army, it's not official --
Then it's unofficial.
Search parties for the others are fanning out in a ten click radius from the pickup. If they're hurt and we can get to them in time...
I called the JAG Corps, the two cadets we retrieved are to be flown to D.C. on a transport leaving here at 1700 --
You think he did it?
No --
What do you think?
It's too neat.
You want Kendall, don't you?
He tried to burn Dunbar to us. You don't do that if you're not involved.
You both know if you do this, if you go after a Senator's son and you're wrong... it's not just me in the hot seat anymore.
We know.
We know.
I'm giving you a chance to walk away.
What happens to Dunbar now?
Gets on his plane in ten minutes, which means you two are done. You'll understand if I don't walk you out.
You never told me why you got kicked out of...
The army kicked you out for drugs...
You motherfuckers have just made the worst mistake of your lives! You have chosen to join my Army! This Army is my mother, my father, and my little virgin sister and I will not allow anyone or anything that is not up to my standards near her pretty little virgin cooze, do you understand me -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
Sir, yes, sir!
Sir, yes, sir!
Those who I deem unworthy to pass through this camp will quit, and those who refuse to quit I will kill. You ever hear of a training accident -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
Those who I deem unworthy to pass through this camp will quit, and those who refuse to quit I will kill. You ever hear of a training accident -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
Sir, yes, sir!
Sir, yes, sir!
In my time I have killed sixteen men for the good of my country, sixteen men whose entrance into this Army I could not condone, as it would weaken the fabric of this nation's defense! This base suffers an average of three training accidents a year, unfortunate incidents that I will not hesitate to repeat if you cross me, understand -- give me a

Sir, yes, sir!
So forget what you've seen on Sixty fucking Minutes about the kinder, gentler military -- you will either succeed, quit, or die by my hand!
Some of you may have heard there's a hurricane coming! American soldiers do not wait for good weather -- they do not wait for a bright sunshiney day to do their duty! An American Soldier learns to operate in the worst conditions and turn said conditions into an advantage against their enemy! Anyone who thinks these conditions are too harsh, feel free to lay
Sir, yes, sir!
Sir, yes, sir!
LZ is two clicks North of a cabin, you are to split into teams of two and work your way through your designated area blasting as many targets as you can find! Each area has twenty targets, first team to take all twenty and find the cabin wins! Teams are as follows -- Dunbar and Nunez, Pike and Mueller, Kendall and Childs!
Great, great. That's fantastic.
It was on that night Karl met his destiny. And I met mine. Almost.
Hey kid! Your friend just made himself a star.
That's great.
See! The big guy likes it.

Who is she? Where does she live?

Kid. Don't waste your time. She's out of your league.
What do you mean? You don't even know me.
Sure I do. You were hot shit back in Hickville, but here in the real world, you got squat. You don't have a plan. You don't have a job. You don't have anything but the clothes on your back.
Sure I do. You were hot shit back in Hickville, but here in the real world, you got squat. You don't have a plan. You don't have a job. You don't have anything but the clothes on your back.
I've got a whole backpack full of clothes!
Someone stole my backpack.
Kid, you were a big fish in a small pond. This here is the ocean, and you're drowning. Take my advice and go back to Puddleville. You'll be happy there.
I don't have a job, but I would have a job if you gave me one. And I may not have much, but I have more determination than any man you're ever going to meet.
Sorry, kid. I don't do charity.
Sorry, kid. I don't do charity.
I'll work night and day, and you won't have to pay me. You just have to tell me who she is.
Didn't kill anything, did I?
A few rabbits, but I think one of them was already dead.
A few rabbits, but I think one of them was already dead.
That would explain the indigestion.
I was wrong about you kid. You may not have much, but what you got, you got a lot of. You could get any girl.
There's only one I want.
Her name is Sandra Templeton. She's going to Auburn. The semester's almost over, so you better hurry.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Good luck, kid.
Welcome to ya. What's your name?
Edward Bloom.
Bloom like a flower?
Yes.
Yes.
Oh. Here! Right here. Edward Bloom. We weren't expecting you yet.
You were expecting me?
Not yet.
What is this place?
The town of Spectre. Best kept secret in Alabama. Says here you're from Ashton, right? Last person we had from Ashton was Norther Winslow.

He's still here. Let me buy you a drink. I'll tell you all about it. Hell, I'll have him tell you.
No. I've gotta meet somebody. I'm already running late.
Now tell me if that isn't the best pie you ever ate.
It truly is.
I have to leave. Tonight.
Why?
Why?
This town is everything a man could ask for. And if I were to end up here, I'd consider myself lucky. But the fact is, I'm not ready to end up anywhere.

No one's ever left.
You won't find a better place!
I don't expect to.
Or are you too scared?
I'll go in right now and get that eye.
I'll go in right now and get that eye.
Then do it.
Then do it.
Fine, I will.
Fine, I will.
Fine, you do it.
Fine, you do it.
Fine, I'm doing it.
You get the eye?
I brought it.
I brought it.
Let's see it.
Bloom!
Don.
Don.
What the hell are you doing? This is my girl. Mine!
What the hell are you doing? This is my girl. Mine!
I didn't know she belonged to anybody.
Will.
Dr. Bennett. It's good to see you. My wife, Josephine.
Dr. Bennett. It's good to see you. My wife, Josephine.
A pleasure.
Can I see him?
Absolutely. Be good for you to talk to him.
Glad to see you're not trying to have a heartfelt talk. It's one of my greatest annoyances, when people talk to those who can't hear them.
My father and I have an advantage. We never talk.
How long have you known my father?
Thirty years. Maybe more.
Thirty years. Maybe more.
How would you describe him?
How would you describe him?
Five-eleven. One-eighty. Regulated hypertension. How would his son describe him?
Did your father ever tell you about the day you were born?
A thousand times. He caught an uncatchable fish.
A thousand times. He caught an uncatchable fish.
Not that one. The real story. Did he ever tell you that?
Not that one. The real story. Did he ever tell you that?
No.
No.
Your mother came in about three in the afternoon. Her neighbor drove her, on account of your father was on business in Wichita. You were born a week early, but there were no complications. It was a perfect delivery. Now, your father was sorry to miss it, but it wasn't the custom for the men to be in the room for deliveries then, so
Did you see that woman?
What did she look like?
What did she look like?
Well, she... uh...
Well, she... uh...
Was she nekkid?
Yeah.
It's not a woman, it's a fish. No one ever catches her.
How old are you?
Eighteen.
Eighteen.
I'm eight. That means when I'm eighteen, you'll be 28. And when I'm 28, you'll only be 38.
I'm eight. That means when I'm eighteen, you'll be 28. And when I'm 28, you'll only be 38.
You're pretty good at arithmetic.
You're pretty good at arithmetic.
And when I'm 38, you'll be 48. And that's not much difference at all.
How are you gonna make it without your shoes?
I suspect it will hurt a lot.
Promise me you'll come back.
I promise. Someday. When I'm really supposed to.
You must be Edward Bloom.
How did you know?
No one would come out here unless they had business. And no one would have business with me except for you. You're buying the town.
Apparently I've overlooked this one piece of it, and I'd like to remedy that. You see, in order for the town to be preserved, the trust must own it in its entirety.

So I've heard.
So I've heard.
I'll offer you more than it's worth. And you know you won't have to move. Nothing will change except the name on the deed, you have my word.
In so many words, yes.
Then I don't think so Mr. Bloom. If nothing is going to change, I'd just as soon it not change in the way it hasn't been changing all this time.
Then I don't think so Mr. Bloom. If nothing is going to change, I'd just as soon it not change in the way it hasn't been changing all this time.
It's not like you're going to lose anything. You can ask anyone in town. I've been nothing if not generous. I want the best for everyone.
Helping people makes me happy.
I'm not convinced you should be happy.
I'm not convinced you should be happy.
I'm sorry. Have I offended you?
You're Beamen's daughter. Your last name is different. You married.
I was 18. He was 28. Turns out that was a big difference.
I won't be selling you this house, Mr. Bloom.
I see. I thank you for your time.
It's okay, just leave it.
I can get it. I can just...
Lord, I'm sorry I...
Please. Go. Just go.
Please. Go. Just go.
I'll...
I'll...
Go.
Don't. Don't be embarrassed. I should never have let you think that... I am in love with my wife.
I know.
I know.
And from the moment I saw her until the moment I die, she's the only one.
And from the moment I saw her until the moment I die, she's the only one.
Lucky girl.
Lucky girl.
I'm sorry, Jenny. I am.
Really.
You're lucky to get four words out of them in English. But if you were to walk through the jungle, you'd hear them speaking the most elaborate French. Those parrots talk about everything: politics, movies, fashion -- everything but religion.
Hi. How are you feeling?
I was dreaming.
I was dreaming.
What were you dreaming about?
Means when you dream about something that's going to happen. Like one night, I had a dream where this crow came and told me, "Your Aunt is going to die." I was so scared I woke up my parents. They told me it was just a dream, to go back to bed. But the next morning, my Aunt Stacy was dead.
That's terrible.
That's terrible.
Terrible for her, but think about me, young boy with that kind of power. Wasn't three weeks later that the crow came back to me in a dream and said, "Your Grampa is going to die." Well, I ran right back to my parents. My father said, no, Gramps is fine, but I could see there was trepidation. And true enough, that next morning
Because see, my mother was banging the milkman.
No, I understand.
No, I understand.
He was slipping her a little extra cream.
He was buttering her rolls. Pumping her churn. Splashing milk in her box.
Stop.
Stop.
They were squeezing the cheese. Clanking the bottles. Licking the popsicle.
Spooning the sherbet.
Can I take your picture?
Can I take your picture?
You don't need a picture. Just look up handsome in the dictionary.
You don't need a picture. Just look up handsome in the dictionary.
Please?
That's because we didn't have a wedding. Your mother-in-law was never supposed to marry me. She was engaged to somebody else.
I never knew.
I never knew.
Will never told you that? Probably just as well. He would have told it all wrong anyway. All the facts and none of the flavor.
Will never told you that? Probably just as well. He would have told it all wrong anyway. All the facts and none of the flavor.
Oh, so this is a tall tale?
Oh, so this is a tall tale?
Well, it's not a short one.
I thought you said you didn't have a church wedding.
Well, we were all set to, but there was a complication.
Is it the medicine that's making you thirsty?
Truth is, I've been thirsty my whole life. Never really known why.
There was one time when I was eleven...
You were talking about your wedding.
You were talking about your wedding.
I didn't forget. I was just working on a tangent. See, most men, they'll tell a story straight through, and it won't be complicated, but it won't be interesting either.

I like your stories.
I like your stories.
And I like you.
Hardly two stories in the whole place. Now I've heard in real cities, they've got buildings so tall you can't even see the tops of 'em.
Really?
Really?
Wouldn't lie to you. And they've got all-you-can-eat buffets. You can eat a lot, can't you?
Wouldn't lie to you. And they've got all-you-can-eat buffets. You can eat a lot, can't you?
I can.
I can.
So why are you wasting your time in a small town? You're a big man. You should be in the big city.
You're just trying to get me to leave, aren't you? That's why they sent you here.
What's your name, Giant?
What's your name, Giant?
Karl.
Karl.
Mine's Edward. And truthfully, I do want you to leave, Karl. But I want to leave with you. You think this town is too small for you, well, it's too small for a man of my ambition. I can't see staying here a day longer.
Mine's Edward. And truthfully, I do want you to leave, Karl. But I want to leave with you. You think this town is too small for you, well, it's too small for a man of my ambition. I can't see staying here a day longer.
You don't like it?
You don't like it?
I love every square inch of it. But I can feel the edges closing in on me. A man's life can only grow to a certain size in a place like this. So what do you say? Join me?
Okay.
Okay.
What did she say?
Beats me.
You know anyone's who's taken it?
That poet, Norther Winslow did. He was going to Paris, France. He must have liked it, because no one ever heard from him again. Tell you what. You take the other way and I'll cut through here. Meet you on the far side.
You're not trying to run away?
Just to be sure, you can take my pack.
You can see my predicament. My wedding ring, the symbol of fidelity to my wife, soon to be the mother of my child, was now lost in the gut of an uncatchable fish.
Make him stop.
What, a father's not allowed to talk about his son?
I am a footnote in that story. I am the context for your great adventure. Which never happened! Incidentally! You were selling novelty products in Wichita the day I was born.

Friend of yours? Did you help him out of a bind?
Friend of yours? Did you help him out of a bind?
Come on, Will. Everyone likes that story.
Come on, Will. Everyone likes that story.
No Dad, they don't. I do not like the story. Not anymore, not after a thousand times. I know all the punchlines, Dad. I can tell them as well as you can. For one night, one night in your entire life, the universe does not revolve around Edward Bloom. It revolves around me and my wife. How can you not understand that?
The one about the witch.
Your mom says I can't tell you that one anymore. You get nightmares.
Your mom says I can't tell you that one anymore. You get nightmares.
I'm not scared.
You -- -- are in for a surprise.
Am I?

Having a kid changes everything. I mean, there's the diapers and the burping and the midnight feedings...
Having a kid changes everything. I mean, there's the diapers and the burping and the midnight feedings...
Did you do any of that?
Did you do any of that?
No, but I hear it's terrible. Then you spend years trying to corrupt and mislead this child, fill its head with nonsense and still it turns out perfectly fine.
No, but I hear it's terrible. Then you spend years trying to corrupt and mislead this child, fill its head with nonsense and still it turns out perfectly fine.
You think I'm up for it?

You learned from the best.
People needn't worry so much. It's not my time yet. This isn't how I go.
Really.
Really.
Truly. I saw it in The Eye.

The Old Lady by the swamp.

She was a witch.

Surprise ending. Wouldn't want to ruin it for you.
There was this panhandler who used to stop me every morning when I came out of this coffee shop near the office.
Okay.
Okay.
And every day I gave him a quarter. Every day. Then I got sick and was out for a couple of weeks. And when I went back there, you know what he said?

You owe me three-fifty.

Really.

True story.
When did you ever work in an office?
There's a lot you don't know about me.
There's a lot you don't know about me.
You're right.
Dad, I'm hoping we can talk about some things while I'm here.
You mean, while I'm here.
You mean, while I'm here.
I'd just like to know the true versions of things. Events. Stories. You.
Your mother hasn't been keeping up the pool. If you wanted to you could...
I will.
I will.
You know where the chemicals are?
You know where the chemicals are?
I used to do it when you were gone, remember? I used to do it a lot.
I thought you weren't dying.
I said this isn't how I go. The last part is much more unusual. Trust me on that.
Why not religion, Dad?
It's rude to talk about religion. You never know who you're going to offend.
Josephine actually went to the Congo last year.
Oh, so you know.
Did I ever tell you about how...
Yes.
The maple tree and the Buick. We heard it.
I think someone hasn't.
But the real story is how I got the car. You see...
Dad?
Dad?
Son?
Son?
Can we talk?
Do you know much about icebergs, Dad?
Do I? I saw an iceberg once. They were hauling it down to Texas for drinking water, only they didn't count on an elephant being frozen inside. The woolly kind. A mammoth.

Dad!
Dad!
What?
What?
I'm trying to make a metaphor here.
I'm trying to make a metaphor here.
Then you shouldn't have started with a question. Because people want to answer questions. You should have started with, "The thing about icebergs is..."

The thing about icebergs is you only see 10 percent of them. The other 90 percent is below the water where you can't see it. And that's what it is with you Dad. I'm only seeing this little bit that sticks above the water.

I've told you a thousand facts. That's all I do, Will. I tell stories.
I've told you a thousand facts. That's all I do, Will. I tell stories.
You tell lies, Dad. You tell amusing lies. Stories are what you tell a five-year old at bedtime. They're not elaborate mythologies you maintain when your son is ten and fifteen and twenty and thirty. And the thing is, I believed you. I believed your stories so much longer than I should have. And then when I realized that everything you said was impossible

You think I'm fake.
You think I'm fake.
Only on the surface. But that's all I've ever seen.
Dad, I'm about to have a kid of my own here. It would kill me if he went through his whole life never understanding me.
It would kill you, huh?
What do you want, Will? Who do you want me to be?
Yourself. Good, bad, everything. Just show me who you are for once.
Yourself. Good, bad, everything. Just show me who you are for once.
I have been nothing but myself since the day I was born. And if you can't see that, it's your failing, not mine.
The river.
The river?
Tell me how it happens.
How what happens?
How what happens?
How I go.
I can try, Dad. If you help. Just tell me how it starts.
Like this.
Like this.
Okay. Okay.
Let's get out of here.
Somehow, you're better. Different. You're getting ready to go. And I say...
Where are we headed?
You say...
You say...
The River!
It's unbelievable.
Story of my life.
You become what you always were. A very big fish. And that's the way it happens.
Yes. Exactly.
I'm sorry.
Don't need to apologize to me. I mean, I'm the luckiest person you're going to find today...
Oh.
But you're wrong. I do know you, at least by reputation. Edward Bloom from Ashton. See, I'm actually engaged to a boy from Ashton. Don Price. He was a few years older than you.
Daffodils?
They're your favorite flower.
They're your favorite flower.
How did you get so many?
How did you get so many?
I called everywhere in five states and explained this was the only way I could get my wife to marry me.
You don't even know me.
I have the rest of my life to find out.
How can I convince you to stop?
Go out with me.
I was drying out.
I see. We need to get you one of those plant misters. We can spray you like a fern.
Wait! I need those!
There is no softer ground than town.
I've been working on this poem for 12 years.
Really.
Really.
There's a lot of expectation. I don't want to disappoint my fans.
This is why you don't show work in progress.
Norther, do you ever regret not making it to Paris?
Norther, do you ever regret not making it to Paris?
I can't imagine any place better than here.
I can't imagine any place better than here.
You're a poet. You oughta be able to. And maybe if you'd seen more, you could.
It's me. Norther Winslow.
I was astonished to see the greatest poet of both Ashton and Spectre all the way out in Texas.
I don't believe it!
I want you to know, when you left Spectre it opened my eyes. There was a whole life out there that I was not living. So I travelled. I saw France, and Africa, half of South America. Every day a new adventure, that's my motto.

That's great, Norther. I'm happy for you. I can't believe I helped.
So what are you up to now?
I'm robbing this place.
This is it? The whole vault.
'Fraid so.
'Fraid so.
Edward, it's got your deposit slip on it.
Oh. Oh.
Hello.
Hello.
I wasn't expecting you.
Are you Jenny Hill?
I am. And you're Will. I've seen your picture, that's how I recognize you. I almost said something at the store, but it would have been awkward. Like this.
How did you know my father?
This was on his sales route, so he was through here all the time. Everyone in town knew him.
Were you and my father having an affair?
Wow. Wow, you just said it. I was expecting to dance around this for another half hour.
Wow. Wow, you just said it. I was expecting to dance around this for another half hour.
I've seen him with women. He flirts. He always has. On some level, I presumed he was cheating on my mother. I just never had proof.
Can I ask you a question? Why did you come here today? If you found this deed, why didn't you just ask Eddie?
Because he's dying.
Look, I don't know how much you want to know about any of this. You have one image of your father and it would be wrong for me to go and change it. Especially this late in the game.
My father talked about a lot of things he never did, and I'm sure he did a lot of things he never talked about. I'm just trying to reconcile the two.
Logically, you couldn't be the Witch, because she was old back when he was young.
No, it's logical if you think like your father. See, to him, there's only two women: your mother and everyone else.
No, it's logical if you think like your father. See, to him, there's only two women: your mother and everyone else.
You didn't become crazy.
You didn't become crazy.
Well, therapy. And one day I realized I was in love with a man who could never love me back. I was living in a fairy tale.
Thank you. I'll bet you need to --
Yes.
Yes.
Down the hall on the right. The door sticks. You have to really pull it.
I spent a week in Morocco for the story. It was incredible.
We'll have to pick up a copy.
I'm going to get started on dishes.
I'll help you.
I'm going to check on him.
I need to lie down for a bit.
I'm sorry. It seems every hour I have to...
I know. It was the same when I was carrying Will. Like clockwork.
Do you like it, being pregnant?
I do.
I do.
I loved it. It sounds peculiar, but I loved every minute of it. I did. Eddie was travelling a lot, so he was gone, but I felt like I always had a piece of him with me. A little part of his soul inside me. I could feel it. It was alive and kicking.
It's bad.
It's more than they thought. They're going to stop chemo.
It's more than they thought. They're going to stop chemo.
You need to go.
You need to go.
Probably tonight.
I'm going with you.
You don't have to.
You don't have to.
I'm going with you.
I talked with your father last night.
Did you?
You never told me how your parents met.
They met at Auburn.
They met at Auburn.
What about the details? How they fell in love. The Circus. The War. You never told me any of that.
What about the details? How they fell in love. The Circus. The War. You never told me any of that.
That's because most of it never happened.
That's because most of it never happened.
But it's romantic.
Mmm.
Mmm, what?
Mmm, what?
Mmm, what. I know better than to argue romance with a French woman.
Do you love your father?
Everyone loves my father. He's a very likeable guy.
Everyone loves my father. He's a very likeable guy.
Do you love him?
You have to understand. When I was growing up, he was gone more than he was here. And I started thinking -- maybe he has a second life somewhere else. With another house, another family. He leaves us, he goes to them. Or maybe there is no family. Maybe he never wanted a family. But whatever it is, maybe he likes that second life
But it's not true.
But it's not true.
What is "true?" I've never heard my father say a single true thing.
Look, I know why you like him. I know why everyone likes him. But I need you to tell me I'm not crazy.
You're not.
You're not.
I need you on my side.
I need you on my side.
I am always on your side. And I think you should talk to him.
What happened?
Your father had a stroke. He's upstairs with your mom and Dr. Bennett.
Your father had a stroke. He's upstairs with your mom and Dr. Bennett.
Is he going to be okay?
How did you get here?
We swam. The Atlantic, it's not that big really.

Ruth McHibbon offered to pick you up at the airport.

We rented a car.
We rented a car.
You didn't need to do that. You just didn't.
Is that Dr. Bennett's car?
He's up with your father.
How is he?
He's impossible. He won't eat. And because he won't eat, he gets weaker. And because he's weaker, he doesn't want to eat.
He's impossible. He won't eat. And because he won't eat, he gets weaker. And because he's weaker, he doesn't want to eat.
How much time does he have left?
How much time does he have left?
You don't talk about those things. Not yet.
I don't know if you've seen it, but Josephine has some photos in the most recent Newsweek.
Really! That's wonderful.
Mom, would you say you understand Dad?
Of course.
Of course.
What I mean is, do you really know what's going on in his head?
What I mean is, do you really know what's going on in his head?
Yes.
Yes.
How is that possible? I mean, you try to ask him a question and suddenly it's another one of his stories. You can't honestly say you know him.
How is that possible? I mean, you try to ask him a question and suddenly it's another one of his stories. You can't honestly say you know him.
Yes, Will, I do. And don't presume things you don't know.
Would you say you understand Josephine?
Yes. But that's a different...
Yes. But that's a different...
No it's not. It's exactly the same. Your father and I met, we dated, and we married -- we chose each other -- because we understood each other on some fundamental level. Just the same as you two.
Josephine and I have a lot in common.
Yes, you both think William Bloom is a very smart man. The problem is, you only see me as your mother, and not as someone's wife. And I've been his wife longer than I've been your mother. You can't discount that.
Yes, you both think William Bloom is a very smart man. The problem is, you only see me as your mother, and not as someone's wife. And I've been his wife longer than I've been your mother. You can't discount that.
True. But I've known him my whole life, and I don't feel like I know him at all. Or ever will.
I know it's not easy. Just remember, he didn't choose to be your father and you didn't choose to be his son. You just ended up together. You could pick numbers out of a dark bag and it'd be just the same. If you ask me, it's a wonder parents and children can stand each other at all.
But I understand you, Mom. I always have.
But I understand you, Mom. I always have.
Well, clearly you don't. But I'm not the mystery you're trying to solve right now.
Before I forget, your father has papers in the basement I'd like you to go through. I wouldn't know what's important.
Mom, do you know who that is? Blonde hair.
Was she one of your teachers?
No. But it's weird. She seemed to recognize me.
No. But it's weird. She seemed to recognize me.
Do you know who that is?
That really happened?
Not everything your father says is a complete fabrication.
Is he awake?
He just fell asleep. Josephine's with him.
Mom?
Yes?
Did you and Dad have any other property?
I suppose your grandmother's house when she passed on. But we sold that right away. Your cousin Shirley bought it.
I suppose your grandmother's house when she passed on. But we sold that right away. Your cousin Shirley bought it.
So you never bought any land.
So you never bought any land.
Heavens no. We had a hard enough time keeping the mortgage on this place.
I don't suppose one of us could stay with him. In case he... In case he wakes up, one of us should be there.
I'll stay. Why don't you go home with Josephine and I'll stay tonight.
I'll stay. Why don't you go home with Josephine and I'll stay tonight.
That's okay?
Mom, do you want some time with Dad?
Yes. Thank you.
You first.
Fifty thousand. Almost exactly.
Put it in the cases. Split it up. And don't forget you owe me £150.
What for?
What for?
You know what for.
You know what for.
No I don't.
No I don't.
I got you those trousers from Paul Smith.
I got you those trousers from Paul Smith.
I've been buying you stuff all week. I've been buying him stuff all week.
I've been buying you stuff all week. I've been buying him stuff all week.
Such as?
When we went to the Hard Rock Cafe. Who paid? When we went to see 'Cats'. Who paid?
Those aren't presents. That's normal friendship stuff

For your hands?
Some women prefer not to scent their bodies with perfume. So now they have scented creams. They help moisturize a woman's skin. This one's my favorite. It's called Ginger Souffle. I recommend... applying the cream while the skin is still damp. So... perhaps just after a shower.

You a preacher?
That's right.

I'm gonna tell you somethin', and it's just gonna be between you and me. I think folks carry on about heaven too much. Like it's some all-you-can- eat buffet up in the clouds. And folks just gonna do as they're told so they can eat what they want behind some pearly gates. I can go to Shoney's for that.
It starts like this... fire... that spreads. Starts in my head. Then moves to my stomach. Then it goes lower.

Let go...
Back-up.
Get rid of it.

Number five with a bullet.
I just want you to know... I mean anybody who says you ever took has got to deal with me.
Go to sleep, Charlie.

You didn't take, did you...? You hear things.
I worked the three nine in Queens, Charlie.
I didn't know.

The lieutenant was on the pad along with the rest of the squad. I was new, didn't know shit. When the feathers flew, I got called in front of the special prosecutor. It's on the top of my personnel file. They think I'm dirty or I cut a deal. Doesn't leave you with a lot of friends either way.

I'd feel better if we had some heat.
Maybe we should bail?
It's incredible. Hit him or something.
I don't think he'd feel it.

He couldn't find his ass with both hands.
Now that's the kind of motorcycle I want to see you on.
Sure, a rice burning crotch rocket...

Pussy, ass, soft personnel.
Joyce can be nice.

Are you expecting anyone?
I wasn't expecting you.
Where do we start looking for this guy?
Where would you look for the mafia?
Where're you going, Ichiro?
The mayor's office, under the bed, the back room at Lombardi's. And call me Ich.

I don't deserve Ohashi's respect.
Why the hell not?
Why the hell not?
I don't, that's all.
What happened?
They made you leave your hotel... ... you caused a disturbance.
It may be too soon to talk about it. When someone we care for dies we... ... keep something of their's. A tie, a pen.
Why weren't you at the platform?
Why weren't you at the platform?
I couldn't keep up. My shame is complete.
You must leave?

A snitch?
What's he saying?
He says they're very nice. He wants to know if you have anymore.
Nick, no one's seen Kobo in three days. He might not even be in Tokyo.
Only one way to find out... Get her up in the morning and put her to bed at night.
You said you could keep up with her! 'No problem, Nick-san.'
No. Don't say anything. Don't do anything, and for Christ's sake, don't apologize!
No. Don't say anything. Don't do anything, and for Christ's sake, don't apologize!

Are we getting married?
You're doing fine, Ich. Now drop it, okay?

It's a new deal. ... coming with me tomorrow?
It's a new deal. ... coming with me tomorrow?
Sugai's not going to be impressed with your gun, Nick. No. I won't put myself in danger for you anymore.
What's in the box?
For Sugai. Caviar, French cheese, ham... If you come to apologize for interrupting his meeting, Sugai may feel obligated to see you.

It's done. You don't have to come.
Grab the keys, Ich, and get inside.
No.

Not now, man, okay, not now. Work with me.
Start it.
I can't...
Just one, compadre... Kampai.
Kampai.
You did great, Ichiro.

Thank you. You have one?
A wife. She left.
A wife. She left.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Me too.
What's that for?
Luck.
You know, Nick, we can't lose.
Why's that?
Why's that?
Because we're the biggest things to hit this town since Godzilla.
You all right?
Yes...
Yes...
Call for help.
Louder, pal, louder.
Joyce, give the assistant Chief Inspector a drink, would you?
Think we'll get him, Nick?
We can't lose.
We can't lose.
How can you be so sure?
Don't give him any more.
He gets as much as he wants.
Ich said you left.
There was a change in plans.
Dead gaiijin's are big news.
Gaiijin?

Maybe I'm a quicker learner.

You know where I can get a decent cup of coffee this time of night? I'm buying.
Somebody must be suffering somewhere, you're being so nice.
I need your help, Joyce.
Where's Ich?
Where's Ich?
Unavailable.
I've heard of Sugai. I've also heard of the emperor. They're both national treasures. One's a hood.
I need someone to translate for me.

You're wrong to sell Ich short.

He's got a reason.
Where's the wife?
You met her.
I'd invite you up but I know you'd hate the incense. I chant.
What do you chant?

Bullshit, Nick. And don't tell me this is all just about Charlie. It's not.
Bullshit, Nick. And don't tell me this is all just about Charlie. It's not.
Why would you care?
I still think you're a bastard.
What if I chant?

Wouldn't help. Watch out for Ich.
Can't make you change your mind?
Last time you asked me to come along I nearly got a hole in my head.

You are a lucky man. Where you come from a man can stand out. It's expected. Here a man is made to look a fool for standing out.
I like your friend, Joyce. You're lucky.
Guess I'm on a roll.

This is my stop.
I'm amused.

How big a package we talking about?

The old man was a Japanese paper manufacturer. Hotel room and rental car were full of it.
One guy do all the damage?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Thought you knew your way around dark alleys, detective.
Doesn't speak a word of English. And he won't speak Japanese either. No papers. The Japanese embassy is very interested.
Why?
Why?
He's wanted in Japan. They want him first. Then we can have him.

Your plane's at nine a.m. Be on it. That's orders. Period.
... Remember, counterfeiting is the Feds. They'll be all over Abolofia's place. Stick tight. You I.D. the other plate, he does real time.
Right.
You lost a man we wanted for some time. It was very incompetent on your part, officer.
Incompetent is letting people waltz through a secure area wearing your uniforms, carrying official documents.

Work with me. I want your best detective.
Hey, inspector, I don't intend to take the rap for this.
Do you know what this is?
Could you fill me in?
Why don't you ask your chief detective?
Because I want you to tell me.
The young are eating the old, something that usually doesn't happen here.

-- Kobo... I know. He killed two of my partners. One in New York, one at the printing plant.
I took Kobo from the street. I gave him a home, a future... But my ways were too slow for him... I served seven years in prison for my boss when I was a young man. Kobo wouldn't serve seven minutes for his Oyabun. He was supposed to take over this syndicate when I retired.
I want him.
I want him.
He'll be dealt with.
Our associates in New York were close to closing a deal with us.
The families who control the casinos?
The families who control the casinos?
Yes. Unlike our syndicates, your criminals don't understand the words 'honor' and 'duty'... We can't afford not to deal with them.
Imagine if your families could pay their gambling and drug debts with perfect counterfeit bought for cents on the dollar.
The Feds would be onto you in a month.
The Feds would be onto you in a month.
Not with these bills. And even if it only took them six months, do you know what our profit margin would be?
Why tell me this?

I don't have to.
Good.
He'll find out you took me. I'm unprotected. He'll kill us. All of us. You don't stand a chance.
That wasn't our deal.
You want him dead too.
You want him dead too.
After a court convicts him. He belongs to me.
Can't thank you enough, Mr. Sebastian. If you hadn't come along...
We were worried to death. It's awfully kind of you.
We're not used to the big city. Where we come from it's not so easy to get lost.
You certainly have a nice place here.

Mr. Sebastian is a host who wants to be appreciated. We'll appreciate him and he'll cooperate.
I'm sure glad you found us, Sebastian. What do you think, Mary?
I don't think there is another human being in this whole world who would have helped us.

What's the point?
Not to be trapped.

You underestimate the trap, Mary.
One man. He must be good.
Then go get him.
Then go get him.
That wouldn't be very sporting.
The name is Batty. Roy Batty.
Oh?
Yeah. It might be better if we talk in private, Sebastian. Why don't you go home.
Here's your check, my boy. Thank you.
I'm surprised you didn't come to me sooner.

Death.

I'm afraid that's a little out of my...
I want more life, fucker.
Come here.
The facts of life. I'll be blunt. To make an alteration in the evolvement of an organic life system, at least by men, makers or not, it fatal. A coding sequence can't be revised once it's established.
Why?
Why?
Because by the second day of incubation any cells that have undergone reversion mutation give rise to revertant colonies -- like rats leaving a sinking ship. The ship sinks.

We've already tried it -- ethyl methane sulfonate is an alkylating agent and a potent mutagen -- it creates a virus so lethal the subject was destroyed before we left the table.
Then a repressor protein that blocks the operating cells.
Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an error in replication, so that the newly formed DNA strand carries a mutation and you're got a virus again... but all this is academic -- you are made as good as we could make you.

Put it this way. Rolls Royces are made to last -- as least they were. But I'm afraid you're a Ferrari. A high strung racing car -- built to win, not to last.
Also you're too valuable to experiment with.
I am?
I've done some questionable things.
Also extraordinary things.

Nothing the God of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for.

Well, no, not really. There's Mr. Deetchum, he's the watchman, he lives on the first floor.
How about breakfast, I was just going to make some.

You're just all so... so different.
What, Sebastian?
You're androids.
What generation are you?
Nexus - 6.
Show me something?
Like what?

We have a lot in common.
You mean that you can't come here and I can't go there?

If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live.
What about your friend, the man who owns this building?
Dr. Tyrell?
He's not really my friend. I just do a job for him now and then.
Tyrell could help us, Sebastian.

He could?

Where are you going, Sebastian?

No, you stay here with us. Out last night together.
What's going on down there?
He's not ready yet.
He's not ready yet.
When?
When?
Tomorrow, he says.
This is my Uncle Roy, Sebastian.
Hello, glad to meet you.
Then we're stupid and we'll die.
Not if everybody is doing their job here at home. How are things at home?
I think, therefore I am.
Very good, Pris. Now show him why.
I want to do it.
Okay, but don't kill him. Save a little for everybody. A masterpiece.
Six, huh?
Five. Three nights ago one of them managed to break into the Tyrell Corporation. Killed two guards and got as far as the Genetic Sector before he got fried going through an electro- field.

What was he after?
What was he after?
There wasn't much left of him, so we can't be sure. But bio- chemical data and morphology records of the Nexus-6 were reported missing. Going on the possibility they might try to infiltrate we send Holden in to run Voight-Kampff tests on the new employees. Guess he found himself one.
You got a machine on it yet?
We're using Esper -- a 231 -- that picked up Holden's alarm. Its guess is that all five are in the city.

Where do we start?
The Tyrell Corporation has a demo model. Check it out on the Voight-Kampff. There's a chance the Nexus-6 is beyond out ability to detect. If that's the case, everybody's up shit creek.
What was the cover on the one that got Holden?

Industrial refuse.

Yeah.
Bryant here. Regarding the rundown you requested on job applicants, Esper's concluded that the only irregular category that Tyrell's got is the entertainment section. You better get on it.

She was gonna get away.
Then let her get away. I thought you were a pro -- you're supposed to be a fuckin' tracker!
I didn't like her.
You didn't like her!?

Okay, here it is. Eldon Tyrell, his family and half his staff were just massacred. The cat is about to get out of the bag. Pressure is definitely on. The Nexus program is terminated. When you finish there, locate Nexus designated Rachael and retire.
If you don't, we will. It has to be total, Deckard. That's an order from as high as it comes. Got it?
Yeah. I got it.
Yeah. I got it.
Go.

Machines can be helpful sometimes, but they can also be a pain in the ass. Ask for a trace on a forger and you might wind up at a steel- mill. I don't mind a bum-steer once in a while -- it's their personalities that usually get me. Somebody once said that man makes machines in his own image. If that's true, whoever made

Here's something you might find interesting. They have been built to emulate the human in every way except in its emotional spectrum. However, after a period of time it is only logical that such a 'mechanism' would create its own emotional responses, hate, love, fear, anger, envy.

I'm with the American Federation of Variety Artists...
There's been reports of management sexually abusing the artists in this place.

You'd be surprised what a guy'll go through to get a glimpse of a beautiful body.
I bet I would.
I bet I would.
Little dirty holes the bastards drill in the wall so they can watch a lady undress.
Me.
And who do I go to about you?
It seems your department doesn't believe out new unit is to the public benefit.
A humanoid robot is like any other machine, it can be a benefit or a hazard. If it's a benefit, it's not our problem.
A humanoid robot is like any other machine, it can be a benefit or a hazard. If it's a benefit, it's not our problem.
But because your department can't do an adequate job in detecting the miniscule number at large, it's a problem. Correct, Mr. Deckard?
It's artificial?
Of course not.
Are you apprehensive?
Why should I be?
Why should I be?
For the responsibility of your power. Being a police bureaucrat, you've got more than your share.
I wouldn't accept it. Also, I'd report the person who gave it to me to the police.
You have a little boy. He shows you his butterfly collection, plus the killing jar.
I'd take him to the doctor.
You're watching T.V. and suddenly you notice a wasp crawling on your wrist.

I'd kill it.
In a magazine you come across a full-page photo of a nude girl.
Is this testing whether I'm an android or a lesbian?
Is this testing whether I'm an android or a lesbian?
You show the picture to your husband. He likes it and hangs it on the wall. The girl is lying on a bearskin rug.
You become pregnant by a man who runs off with your best friend, and you decide to get an abortion.
I'd never get an abortion.
I'd never get an abortion.
Why not?
Why not?
That would be murder, Mr. Deckard.
That would be murder, Mr. Deckard.
In your opinion.
In your opinion.
It would be my child.
It would be my child.
Sounds like you speaks from experience.
Last question. You're watching an old movie. It shows a banquet in progress, the guests are enjoying raw oysters.
Ugh.
Is there anything else?
I know you think it complicates your work, but I'm here to help.
I know you think it complicates your work, but I'm here to help.
I've already got more help than I need.
I've already got more help than I need.
I think you need more help than you've got.
There's two reasons a man rejects help. Either because he's so good at what he does he doesn't think he needs it, or he's so insecure he can't admit it.
Sounds like I'm an ass-hole either way, but the answer is still no.

I work alone.
You use your equipment, don't you?
So?
So?
So, I'm a piece of equipment. Use me.
Do I make you nervous?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
I can imagine.
Can you? I couldn't.
They probably want to find out when they were made.
Right.
Don't just stand there looking at me. It's not polite.
What do you want me to do?
What do you want me to do?
Sit.
You ever take a bath with a man before?
There's a lot I haven't done with a man before.
I told you I'd come back.
You did?
You did?
You didn't hear me. You were sleeping.
Who is this?
Me and my dad.
Me and my dad.
Where is he?
Where is he?
Dead.
Dead.
Oh.
How come you're not on the job?
I am. Part of my job is to sit on a couch and try and figure things out.
I am. Part of my job is to sit on a couch and try and figure things out.
How are you doing?
How are you doing?
Not too good.
What do people do in the afternoon?
If they are smart, they take naps.
Do you dream?
Yeah. Sometimes.
Yeah. Sometimes.
I wish I could.
Did you cry when your father died?
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's another thing I can't do.
Nobody is freer than when he dreams. I read that.
It wasn't very good last night, was it?
It wasn't very good last night, was it?
I don't know, I have nothing to compare it to. I guess I thought there was something more to it.

I don't know... I think I missed something.

I'm not sure. Is there a secret?
When was the last time you cleaned this place?
Hmmm?
Hmmm?
Have you ever cleaned your apartment?
Have you ever cleaned your apartment?
Don't be fooled by appearances.
Don't be fooled by appearances.
It appears to be dirty -- why don't you get somebody?
They could clean around the arrangement.
I don't like people snooping around my stuff.
But if I don't plug it in how can I...
Never mind the plug, just go through the motions.
Never mind the plug, just go through the motions.
But then how can you...
But then how can you...
I don't like the noise. Just practice. Practice makes perfect.
This feels stupid.
Good for a smart girl to feel stupid. Part of your education.
You're sick, Deckard.
I never felt better.
Have you ever known anybody a long time?
You mean a woman?
You mean a woman?
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
What's a long time?
What's a long time?
Ten years.
Ten years.
Nope. Nobody could stand me that long.
Why do you call it retire, why don't you call it murder?
Because it's not.
Because it's not.
Don't you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered?

Do you think I simulated what happened between us?

No, I don't.
Don't leave here. Don't open the door, don't answer the phone.
What difference will it make?
What difference will it make?
Just wait here.
You know what I think?
What?
What?
That some of the folks around here are more programmed then me.
Where the hell you been?
You know where I been. I been on vacation.

Next time you go on vacation, do me a favor, let us know where it is.

Please.
Is this to be an empathy test?
Yes.
Yes.
Capillary dilation of the so-called blush response? Plus fluctuation of the pupil, plus involuntary dilation of the iris?
May I ask a personal question?
Go ahead.
Go ahead.

How many questions did it take?
Thirteen.
She didn't know?
Memory implant. She was programmed. But I think she has transcended her conditioning. I think she was beginning to suspect.
How many questions does it usually take, Mr. Deckard?
Five, maybe six.
And how is it one man will be able to cover so much ground?
Discreetly.
Discreetly.
All pertinent information is being fed into your departmental computer, an Esper 231 -- I believe -- and a photo over-lay packet is being produced.
Let's keep our eyes on the road, Deckard.
Sorry.
We're going to have to start the sequence again if you don't stay with me, Deckard. Concentrate.

Good.
Sebastian doesn't like to go out too much.
I keep a lot of provisions right here.
What makes you think so?
You're all so perfect.
Hi!
Yes?
Yes?
I was wondering if you might help me. I...I seem to have lost my Congressional Medal of Honor somewhere around here.
Oh, now, that's a great one!

Young man, stop right there!

It certainly is. I agree with you completely.

Eve? I'm leaving.
Bon soir, mademoiselle!
Are you French?
Are you French?
No. I'm from out of town. I'm here on business.
No. I'm from out of town. I'm here on business.
Well, your business must not be sports memorabilia, because this one Mantle card right here-- --is worth six thousand dollars all by its little self.
Get out of here!
No, you get out of here.
Come on, Heathcliff, I'll walk you to the corner.
Yes, ma'am. But my name is Adam.
Where are we going?
We? I'm going home. And, judging by that coat, I'd say you have to get back to the barber college.

Oh, that's nice.
Oh, that's nice.
Let me guess something. This is your first visit to La La Land. You're staying somewhere over in Hollywood because, like an idiot, you thought that would be an exciting place to stay. Right so far?
So far?
Yes, I'm right?
Yes, I'm right?
Right.
Right.
I knew it! So anyhow, you get on a bus and before you know it, you're out here in the San Fernando Valley without a clue. Which brings us to here. Correct again?

Rogers Hornsby's worth like four thousand dollars!
So what?! I've got two of him! And this many DiMaggios and Robinsons. I was holding these out, too.
So for four thousand dollars, all I have to do is drive you to your hotel?

It never works out because I'm into legs and butts and hair myself! That's why! So I wind up with guys who are very good looking, but even more shallow than I am, if you can picture that. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go find another low-paying, demeaning job where some guy named Jerry keeps telling me how lousy his marriage

And if possible, I'd like to marry someone from Pasadena.
When do you need her by?

Whatever you two want. If you've got the time, I've got the wazoo.
What about holding your right arm up like that all the time?
It's fine. Just give it a try. And for gosh sake, Eve, take your foot off the chair!
He's going to kill himself. Go skate out on the bike path! It's that way!

Yeah, sweet. That's a nice way of putting it.
What do I say to Miss Sweet when I meet her?
Really?
Yes, really! Basically, they want what they think they can't have. Same with guys. That's why everybody is walking around here sending off "you can't have me" signals!
That's ridiculous.
Maybe. But that's how it works.
Yeah. Could be. Go say hello, Romeo. Looks like a healthy non-mutant to me.
Okay. All right. And what do I say?

But it just wasn't where I wanted to be so I left as politely as I could and found a taxi. But I asked the driver to drop me here instead of at the hotel. There's a song Mister Como sings called "On the Street Where You Live." You know it?

You never know. You may someday dine at the White House with the president.
Dad!
Oh, no! Oh, my goodness! Let's get him into the bedroom.
He seems to be doing all right now. I don't know if he's had a heart attack or just... a horrifying experience. But we need supplies and I've got to stay with him.
I'll go up.
I'm afraid you've got to.
I'll be all right.
I'll be all right.
You're my brave boy.
I don't know how far you'll have to travel to find supplies, but if you can't get home by nightfall, I want you to look for something called a Holiday Inn. Write that down. It's a hotel. There might still be one standing.
Yes, ma'am.
Right.
I just hope this is still good up there.
I just hope this is still good up there.
Mom?
Yes?
I was thinking that, uh...you know, while I was up there and all...that maybe I could, you know...try to meet a girl. I've, been thinking about that a little...just these last...fifteen years or so.
Oh, Adam,that would be wonderful if you could find a girl. One who's not a mutant...and hopefully comes from Pasadena. Nothing against Valley girls, but in my day anyhow, the girls from Pasadena, I don't know...always just seemed a little nicer.
Yes, ma'am.
Here's the shopping list and $3,000 which should take care of everything.
Yes, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am.

Are you in trouble, son?!

Mom? Eve and I have to go.
What?
What?
I can't explain it now. But I want you to set the locks for two months. You have more than enough of everything. Then we'll be back to get you.
We have to go.
No, wait! At least stay for dinner!
This is your bedroom?
No, Mom, I've turned it into Dad's office.

You know, I don't think so. I'm confused but you know, I don't think he'd ever hurt me. I don't think he'd hurt anyone.

Let's all remain calm. That's the key thing.
According to Caltech, this Webber guy was a bonafide genius and a borderline nutcase.

You got a light, honey?
What?! A light! Yes, I've got a light!

Good.
So...you...survived the blast, did you?
The blast? Honey, I have survived a host of things. Like the song says: "A country boy can survive!"

Yes, yes, the song. So tell me...has it been...hell up here?

Uh-huh. And it's all yours for the remarkably low price of only $200! And if you act now, I might even throw in some free lawn furniture.

No, I can't. I'm sorry! I have to go! I have to...
For Pete's sake, Calvin! We've got guests!
Sorry, honey! I just got to fooling with this darn rheostat.
Sorry, honey! I just got to fooling with this darn rheostat.
Well, put it down and come in!
Well, put it down and come in!
You bet, hon!
I'm sorry everyone, but given this extraordinary turn of events, I think it's prudent that we cut the evening short. I'm sure this Cuban thing will resolve itself, but in the meantime...I'd suggest taking a prayerful watch-and-wait stance!
We'll do this again! Maybe next week. Here's your hat. Could I wrap something up for you? Did you have a coat?
It's time.
Time? Oh, no Calvin. It's not time yet. I still have--
It shuts off automatically.
Did you rig it to do that? You're so clever.
Did you rig it to do that? You're so clever.
No. They all do.
No. They all do.
I never know anymore.
You hear that?!
Yes.
Calvin, I wish you would have at least let me do the dishes. It's not going to be that easy getting all that dried- on food off my nice plates.
I just hope those plates aren't radioactive by tomorrow morning.

Yeah, yeah. Okay. Give me the roast and watch your step. I'll come back for the radio.
How long will we have to stay down here?
I don't know. For this thing to blow over, it could take days.

Yes, dear!

As long as we've got that straight.
Home sweet home!
To you maybe.
What's that noise?
The locks.

Hi, honey! Feeling better?
No.

We have to be strong, sweetheart. If not for ourselves, for the child.

No, Calvin, you're favorite.

Really?
Maybe I've just got the creeps.
How could you?! This is just like home!
No. No! Calvin, this is different! Believe me!
Would you like a tranquilizer?
Would you like a tranquilizer?
You have tranquilizers?

I told you! I've got everything!
Oh, no.
What?

Uh, oh. Now it's time.
Uh, oh. Now it's time.
Honey?
Is there a problem?
No, Calvin. Babies cry.

I've noticed.

What shall we call him?
No. I think it's just right.
And I was wondering...if...if I could have a...

What? Whatever you want, Helen!
Calvin?!
Right here!
Right here!
We looked all over for you. What are you doing back here?
We looked all over for you. What are you doing back here?
Oh, I was just examining this rear hatchway.
Oh, I was just examining this rear hatchway.
Why?
Why?
No reason. Well, it's pretty clear that the front entrance caved in when the bomb went off. So, you know, when the time is up, we'll have to return to the surface using, you know, this back entrance. Which is very nice because it has the service elevator!

Very nice. Unless it caved in, too.
Yes. Well... yes.
Watch this!
What?
Not bad for a three and a half year old! I'd like to see the public school system match that! I don't care how terrific it is!
Yes, he's very bright, dear. Much like his father. But you know, Calvin, maybe he's a little...young for school.
Yes, he's very bright, dear. Much like his father. But you know, Calvin, maybe he's a little...young for school.
Nonsense. People have no idea what the human mind is capable of. Look at us!
Yes, you certainly will. And you'll find a nice girl and rebuild America. Just the way it used to be.
Oh, Calvin, I'm not sure we should be making promises that perhaps can't be kept.
Oh, Calvin, I'm not sure we should be making promises that perhaps can't be kept.
I believe there will be other survivors. In fact, I'm guessing there's life on the surface, even now. It's not life worth living perhaps, but believe me, something's moving around up there. And I don't just mean the cockroaches.
Hi, honey!
Hi.
Calvin!
Coming!
Get the presents and do the lights.
You bet.
No kidding. Who else would have done it?
And I made these!
What did you wish for, Adam?
If he tells, it won't come true!
If he tells, it won't come true!
Oh, that's just a bunch of baloney! We never believed that in my family!

Well, we did in my family!

Calvin Webber! What a thing to say!
Calvin Webber! What a thing to say!
Well, we'll be going up in two years. We'll know then. I'm very hopeful.
Let's eat our cake.
Yeah. Let's dig in!
If we still have one.
Yes...
Yes...
You know, when we do go up...I'm going to miss this old place. How 'bout you, hon?
You know, when we do go up...I'm going to miss this old place. How 'bout you, hon?
Would you excuse me?
Would you excuse me?
Sure.
In the generator room again?
Oh, yes. It just fascinates me how all these things work.
Oh, yes. It just fascinates me how all these things work.
I know exactly what you mean! Hey, honey?
Should we say a little prayer first?
Just open the door.
Yes, yes it is!
It's an archaic colloquialism, roughly meaning..."good".
It's an archaic colloquialism, roughly meaning..."good".
Yes! That's right!
I'm going to give it to you straight. There's no point in beating around the bush. There were survivors. Apparently, the fallout has created....a subspecies of mutants.
Mutants?!
Mutants?!
It's not a pretty sight. Some eat out of garbage cans. Others are...cover your ears, Son, and hum. I mean that literally and I mean right now!
Others are...multi-sexual. It seems...they can be both masculine and feminine...simultaneously.
No.
No.
Yes.
Yes.
I don't believe it!
They've done a lot of re-building but society, at least as we knew it, has utterly collapsed. People throw up in the streets. Others point guns. There's something terribly wrong with the automobiles and...and I...I can't tell you the rest. I just can't.
Oh my. Oh,my, oh my, oh, my. So, what do we do now?
Oh my. Oh,my, oh my, oh, my. So, what do we do now?
We stay down here.
We stay down here.
We do?
We do?
Yes.
Yes.
Excuse me.
For how long? We've just about run out of everything!
We'll make do. I'm of the opinion that these mutants will eventually kill each other off and then--
We'll make do. I'm of the opinion that these mutants will eventually kill each other off and then--
No, Calvin. We're not going to make do. Not me! Not Adam. We're going up no matter what! We deserve it. Even if it's terrible!
No, Calvin. We're not going to make do. Not me! Not Adam. We're going up no matter what! We deserve it. Even if it's terrible!
Well, I am the head of this household--

I want him to at least see the sky!

And the ocean! A mountain range!

He's smart.
Yes, dear, I know.
And Lord we ask finally that you send an angel to look after and protect our beloved son, Adam. Amen.
Amen.
How long will you set it for this time?
I thought ten years.
I thought ten years.
Well, that's...considerably shorter than before. I was wondering, Calvin, why set the locks at all. I mean the radiation is gone and...
Well, that's...considerably shorter than before. I was wondering, Calvin, why set the locks at all. I mean the radiation is gone and...
To keep what's up there from getting down here! It's not the radiation I'm worried about.
Well, please excuse us! We...we haven't entertained a guest in...um...
Some time.
Some time.
What can I offer you, Eve?
What are you bitching about now?
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
I forgot some of my stuff.
I forgot some of my stuff.
Your stuff? Let me see that.
You came back for these?
Hey, they're Ralph Laurens. And who's this interesting looking fellow?
Hey, they're Ralph Laurens. And who's this interesting looking fellow?
This is Adam. Adam, meet Cliff.
Go home, Cliff, wherever that might be.
Shana Gillroy's apartment. Remember her? The model who went to Harvard? Well, I better get going! Bye, Adam. Nice coat!
So where is your roommate, the model?
You know, I don't know. And looking at you, I don't care. It's been too long, Eve.
Go home, Adam. Go to your hotel.
Yeah. Before I kick your ass.
Stop it, you two!
I guess we shouldn't fight in here.
Eve! This guy is un-be-liev-able!
I knew you'd like him.
I knew you'd like him.
Darlin', this is X-File stuff! Think about it! The guy's got all this easily negotiable property. He's obviously setting something up very big. Like a self-sustaining island off the coast of South America, for instance. Or perhaps he's the head of a cult that's doing weird things with poultry and pipe tobacco. I've heard worse.
So, Adam...where on earth are you from?
Out-of-town. That's all he'll say.
Since that guy rear-ended me in Palm Springs.
Oh, yes.
Oh, yes.
I even guessed his hotel, didn't I?
Give me your hand.
Oh, my God...
But first, you have to start with the clothes!
Exactly. You understand that, don't you? You have no chance of meeting a woman dressed like that.
I don't know.
Money is no object. He's got cards up the wazoo.
You're serious, aren't you?
What's that supposed to mean?
What's that supposed to mean?
It means that your taste in men's apparel is as bad as your taste in men.

Well, that's blunt!

I'm sorry. But if the shoe fits.

And I suppose you see him in some sort of strapless thing, don't you?
And I suppose you see him in some sort of strapless thing, don't you?
I see "elegant."

Yeah? Like Ralph Lauren?

That's what I'm sensing.
Alright, I will.
I'm busy tomorrow anyway. I have to buy six thousand paper napkins.
I'm busy tomorrow anyway. I have to buy six thousand paper napkins.
What do you think, Adam?
Well, what do you think?
I think...it...works.
I think...it...works.
Let me show you the entire trousseau!
How 'bout it, Eve? Can he skate around your block?
No.
That water's freezing!
He's from Alaska.
Just be yourself.
Always good advice.
Always good advice.
For him. It doesn't work for the rest of us.
Are you kidding?! You wouldn't even be a crumb on her table! You don't see that?!
Eve?!
Eve?!
Well, I'm trying to educate him! It's nothing personal.
Well, I'm trying to educate him! It's nothing personal.
Adam, I think for you, we should go for "sweet."
Um... Eve?
It's not so much what you say but how you say it. Women like men who are unpredictable.
Go to the bathroom.
Right here? Well, you're being so bossy I wasn't sure!
He go back to the hotel?
Uh..he might of.
What's that mean?
We did not leave together.
We did not leave together.
Who did he leave with?
What's it to you?!
I'm his pimp. He left with the dancers, didn't he?

Hey, you're the psychic. Eve, the psychic pimp. You tell me.

Yeah. But who's not a slut these days?
Where are you going?
To bed.
To bed.
To bed?
To bed?
Yeah. I'm not the one who's in love with the guy.
Yeah. I'm not the one who's in love with the guy.
What?! Now hold on! Wait one damn minute!
In the first place, I don't fall in love with weirdos I've only known for four or five days.
Yes, you do.
Yes, you do.
And I don't fall in love with grown men who collect baseball cards!!
And I don't fall in love with grown men who collect baseball cards!!

Or pee in their pants when they see the ocean!

Yes, you do!
Yes, you do!
Or have perfect table manners.
Or have perfect table manners.
You know, I asked him about that. And he said that good manners are a way we have of showing other people that we respect them. See, you'd eat like a slob if you were alone, but since another human being is present, you show that person respect by going to the trouble of having proper manners. I didn't know that. I thought it

Well, consider the source. I don't even know what a lady is.
Well, consider the source. I don't even know what a lady is.
Exactly! I thought a gentleman was somebody who owned horses. Turns out, the short and very simple definition of a gentleman or a lady is: someone who always attempts to make the people around him or her feel as comfortable as possible. That's it! If you don't do that, nothing else matters. The cars, the clothes, the houses...

It's true. She swept him out the door whispering little French things into his ear.
It's true. She swept him out the door whispering little French things into his ear.
Oh, no! Not Sophie! No way! Please don't tell me that!!
What are you going to do? Go over to her place and kick in the door?
You're goddamn right I am!
I don't think so.
Coward!
Well what was I supposed to do?! He wants me to live underground with him! That's like Silence of the Lambs, don't you think?!
I know...I know. You did the right thing.
Oh, no!
What?!
Gay.
Oh. Well, you're...certainly welcome!
Good God...you don't think there really is a bomb shelter, do you?
Fallout shelter.
What do you want to do with it?
Give it back to him.
Give it back to him.
And if we can't find him?
And if we can't find him?
We'll find him.
What's wrong?
I don't know. Everything's so neat. It's all just so...goddamn dear. Damn!
I don't know. Everything's so neat. It's all just so...goddamn dear. Damn!
See these? Found them in the box with the cards. These are stock certificates. IBM. AT&T. Polaroid.
Millions upon millions upon millions! The cards. The stock! The clothes! The toothpaste! The guy was on the level! And you blew it! A man walks into your life who is the kindest, most polite, honest, trustworthy, incredibly rich guy you have ever met in your life!! And what do you do?!
Have him committed.
Have him committed.
Yeah! That's thinking.
Yeah! That's thinking.
He was always so "nice"! How was I supposed to know that's a good thing?! "Nice" is weird! Nice is...what is "nice"? It's not cool! I'll tell you that. Was it ever?

I don't know. I like to think so.
Well, at least I fell for him before I found out he was rich! That's new. Wait a minute! He said today he knew where home was. What happened this morning?! Where did you go?!
Well, at least I fell for him before I found out he was rich! That's new. Wait a minute! He said today he knew where home was. What happened this morning?! Where did you go?!

Stop!
I'm going to need two more banana- splits and a cherry coke!
You bet, Mom! Coming up!
I can't tell the boys from the girls anymore!
Uh...yeah. It's like hard.
I miss those nice flower-power kids. How 'bout you?
Um...uh...
I'm selling this place. I want out of this hell hole!
Could I, like...oh, wow...like,uh...
Could I, like...oh, wow...like,uh...
Buy it from me?

Yeah! Yeah, that's it!

I think it's important not to get depressed. Depression is a terrible thing. They say it can bring on illness.
Aunt Barbara. I'll try not to get depressed.
Jeffrey, you're not going down by Lincoln, are you?
No, I'm just going to walk around the neighborhood. Don't worry.
Doctor Gynde, my whole family's sick. What's going on?
I'm not sick.
Will you tell Mom when she gets home from the hospital that I've gone to dinner at Sandy Williams' house?
Okay honey. That sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.

He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.

Ooooo, you are smart. Just don't get too smart.
Alright, now tell me. What is it?
There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. Sometimes, in some cases, it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment, you know, sneak in and hide and observe.

Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window.

Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.

I don't know why we have to watch TV.
Mike. We don't have to watch it. Come on.
Sandy? Could I talk to you a minute?
Sure, just a sec. Excuse me.
Come on out a minute, okay?
Okay.
Hey come here, you stole my girl, you bastard. I'm gonna kick your ass, right in front of your stupid house.
Stop it Mike.
Stop it Mike.
You shut up. Nobody's talkin' to you. Hey who's that Jeffrey? Your mother?
What did he bring him in for?
Needed an outsider. The package boy knows everyone. He'd spot our hitters a mile away.

Just for him?

Well he's the one shooting up all his guys, right? He's scared of the kid. Says he's real good, got every available gun in the city up there.

Up where?

Up his house. I don't know what's going on but I know it's gotta have something to do with this kid.

Oh fuck!
Fuck you.
Hey, Augustus, I need your help, I got a serious problem here. I'm not screwing around.
Hey, Augustus, I need your help, I got a serious problem here. I'm not screwing around.
I bounced you on my knee at family reunions, for Christ sakes. Your dad and me ran the whole east coast syndicate you snot-nosed little prick. And when you took the wheel, who was beside you?
Hey, I just...
Don't start with your shit. Don't you talk to me. Oh, hey Uncle Gussy, thanks for years of service. Here's a gold watch and a job sniffing other guys' shit eight hours a day. What am I, a retired bus driver?
Don't start with your shit. Don't you talk to me. Oh, hey Uncle Gussy, thanks for years of service. Here's a gold watch and a job sniffing other guys' shit eight hours a day. What am I, a retired bus driver?
I need Il Duce.
I need Il Duce.
The Duke? What did you do?
The Duke? What did you do?
This kid, this package boy could bring down the whole east coast. If he decides to turn states he could dismantle us... totally. But it looks like for now, he's content with just killing us one by one. And even worse the kid is good at it. I mean I had a prodigy on my hands the whole time and didn't even know it.
Listen kid, I think you better understand who you're dealing with here.
Yeah. I was only twelve or thirteen when you guys used to talk about him, like he was a ghost or something.
Yeah. I was only twelve or thirteen when you guys used to talk about him, like he was a ghost or something.
Your dad and I used him three times over twenty years, only when everything went totally fucked. Believe me kid, you don't want this guy unless you are 100% sure you need him. He is... a fuckin' monster.
There's ways around that.
Go find one.
Lord's name.
Mother Mary, full of grace.
Mother Mary, full of grace.
What did you do, Connor?
Well listen, I know how my boys take ta scrappin' when they take ta drinkin'.
Yes mother.
Yes mother.
I mean it now. I carried the two of you little bastards around in my belly at the same time you ungrateful pissants. Ya ruined my girlish figure in one fell swoop, and then ya sucked me dry. My tits are saggin' down ta my ankles. I trip over em for Christ sakes, now ya listen ta me, NO FIGHTEN!
Are ya ready?
Aye.
Yes sir.
Look in the trash around their hands. See if you can find me two bullet casings. 45's, if my eye serves me right. Don't disturb them. Mark them as they lay. Newman, root through this shit. If this was a sink find me some metal parts. Gimme a faucet or a drain cover or something.
Paraffin came up positive. And bullet holes are usually a big clue.
I can't find the second one, sir.
I can't find the second one, sir.
Look under the body.
Look under the body.
Got it.
Are these me considered armed and dangerous?
Well, not armed. If they had guns, they'd have used them. But dangerous? Oh yeah.
Look, look! I'm not saying one way or the other. Just be careful and go by the protocol on this one.
Any tips on where these guys may be?
Any tips on where these guys may be?
Any word back from the E.R.s?
Ah, Agent Smecker, we have a problem.

The press is everywhere outside. They're going nuts for these guys. What do you want to do?
The press is everywhere outside. They're going nuts for these guys. What do you want to do?
You're not being charged. It's up to you. Do you want to talk to them?
Oh, God! Don't kill me! We're on the same side! The boss musta sent you in as back up, huh? Oh, shit, please! I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man. They call me the funny fuckin' man!
Where's your gun?

Chest pocket. Shit!

This is a six-shooter.
Poppa Joe said there was only two. In and out. Boy, you guys sure did a good job. You're good, huh? Cool masks. Where'd you get them?
Let's do him right here.
What did you do?! Fuckin'... what the fuckin' fuck! Who the fuck, fucked this fuckin'? fuck. How did you two fuckin', fucks?......... FUCK!!!
Certainly illustrates the diversity of the word.
What the fuck are you doing here? What, huh!? WHAT? WHAT? WHAT? ANSWERS! I WANT FUCKIN' ANSWERS!
Get a hold of yourself, man.
Anybody you think is evil?
Yes.
Yes.
Don't you think that's a little psycho? A little weird?
Don't you think that's a little psycho? A little weird?
Weird, huh?... Know what I think is weird? Decent men with loving families go home every day after work. They turn on the news and see rapists, murderers, and child molesters all getting out of prison.
Climb the corporate ladder, boy. Don Rocco.
Fuck it! I'm doing it. I deserve it. I've been working for those fat bastards since I was in high school and look at this place.
Donna's gonna be angry about her cat.
Shit. She's on every drug know to man. She'd have sold that thing for a dime bag. Screw her. But I do kinda feel like an ass-hole.
Shit. She's on every drug know to man. She'd have sold that thing for a dime bag. Screw her. But I do kinda feel like an ass-hole.
You sound real remorseful.
She ain't been around in weeks anyhow.
Listen. Something's been bothering me about last night.

He probably knew you'd end up nailing the fat guy, maybe one or two more, but he had to know you weren't walking out of there. Figure it out. Shooter's dead on the scene. No in-depth investigation. It'd slide right off his back. 'Cause as much as I love ya, you're not exactly Don Corleone. What would he be losing? A thirty- five year

No, no. That's just not the way things are done. Besides, how's he know I don't just get in there see there's too many and just serve em their fuckin' food and beat it?

He knows you, man. He knows all you want is to move up. That's all. A smooth hitter woulda gone in there, seen it was a wash and slipped out. But a guy like you? Knowin' this is your only chance? Waitin' eighteen years?

No. No man. That's... that's... you don't know what you're talking about. That's bullshit. I know these guys. I mean, thanks for your concern, but that just ain't the thing of it.

I killed em! Oh, Jesus! I killed em all!!
What did I fuckin' do?... in the middle of the Lakeview.
Lakeview the deli? Oh, shit!
Anybody see ya?
Fuck, man! I may as well have posted flyers. Right out in public, man.
Yeah, well...
Oh, what the fuck? How do you guys decide who you're... I mean, who makes the cut? Is there a raffle or something?
I guess we really don't have a system of deciding who.
MEEE! ME! I'm the guy! I know everyone, their habits, where they hang out, who they talk to. I know where they fuckin' live. We could kill everyone!
What the fuck are you doing?
I-I'll tip her.
What? What is it?
This place is like a scumbag yard sale.
Oh man. You gotta let me do these guys. I'm such a moron. I gotta make up for the tit thing.
No way. I've been waitin' for this asshole.
No way. I've been waitin' for this asshole.
Aw, c'mon. I gotta clear my family name here. I've brought shame to the house of Della Rocco.
You guys gotta teach me that prayer, man. That's some good shit.
Forget it. It's a family prayer. My father, his father before him that sort of shit.
Forget it. It's a family prayer. My father, his father before him that sort of shit.
C'mon!
Who the fuck was he, Rocco? I know you fuckin' know!
Fuck you! I told you I never saw him before!
Look again for fuck sake!
I know what the fuck he looks like!
Shit.
What? What, that guy?
They got nothing.
This guy is very sharp. If he hasn't figured us out yet, he will.
You little fuck. Let him go. I'll drop you right here.
Okay, just calm down. He could hurt us, brother. He could ruin the whole thing.

Is that worthless brother of your there? I want you both ta hear this.
Ma, what's wrong?
It's all your fault. Both you little bastards. I was a fool to believe you would bring me any peace. The day your Da left us when you were almost too young to remember, he said the two of you would do me right and make me proud, but he was wrong and I got nothin' ta live for.
Mother, what are you sayin'? You're talkin' crazy here.
I finally found your Da's army revolver, Connor.
What the hell are you doin' with Da's gun!?
What?! What are you doin'?
I want ta tell ya one last thing before I pull the trigger.
I want ta tell ya one last thing before I pull the trigger.
Pull the trigger?! Have ya lost it woman?! Now just calm down here.
No ma! No!
BLAME...
How's Uncle Sibeal?
Well, you know how it is with him. Always complainin' he's never turnin' a profit on St. Patty's. Whole damn family goes down there with no money, cause we know he can't bear ta charge us.
Well, we tried ta make friends and she gave me a shot ta the nuts.
What... the dirty bitch! I hope ya trounced her a good one!
What... the dirty bitch! I hope ya trounced her a good one!
Well, I didn't but...
Yeah, we promise.
Well, there's my boys. Shit. I gotta go. Looks like I caused a ruckus with that shot. Half the damn neighborhood is comin'.
Still bickerin' over that, huh?
Come on, ma. Out with it. Who came out first?
Come on, ma. Out with it. Who came out first?
All right, I suppose you have the right ta know.
You guys are not under oath, here. I am assuming you knew these two guys from before, huh?
We... met them last night.

They had some pretty interesting bandages. Know anything about that?
So, how is it that you guys are fluent in Russian?
We paid attention in school.
We paid attention in school.
Know any other languages?
Well, we could try the bag over the head thing. Walk you right out the front.
Our mother can see through bags.
Well, the light caught the side of his face for a second. And it looked like he had a gray beard, maybe... late fifties, early sixties.

All right, love ya ma. Listen, before ya go just give us the goods, eh?
Yeah. It's been twenty-seven years.
"What do we tell him about the guns and money?"
"We just got up and left. Bum musta rolled them before the police got there."

Listen fellas, Y'know he's got 'til this week's end. Ya don't have ta be hard asses, do ya?
Yeah, it's St. Patty's day. Everyone's Irish tonight. Now, why don't ya pull up a stool and have a drink with us?
"Now, that wasn't too polite, was it?"
"I'm afraid we can't let that one go, Ivan."
How do you think he figured all this out without talking to us?
Italian.
I have no idea. Maybe someone saw and talked.
German. Not in our neighborhood, man. A hundred percent Irish. No one talks to cops. Period.

We'll find it. Just calm down.
We'll find it. Just calm down.
No, fuck you. This rope is bullshit. I'm sweatin' my ass off draggin' this stupid thing around. Must weigh 30 pounds.
We're doing some serious shit here. Now, get a hold of yourself, asshole.

Kill em all. Admit it, even you've thought about it.
Where are you goin'? Did you tell him?
Yes.
Yes.
Then what the fuck?
Who did you kill?
Holy shit. Who? How many?
So what do you think?
I'm strangely comfortable with it.
We've teamed up with a sex offender.
So, when are you getting a plastic fuck doll?
Give the guy a shot.
Rocco, this is the real deal. We must kill without hesitation, without guilt or remorse. Evil man, dead man.
There he goes. Okay, gentlemen. Are we ready to bring this man into the light? Are we ready to truly do the work of the Lord?
A-fuckin'-men!
That's the guy that got us off the hook with the "Checkov" thing.
And he is one smart man.
He isn't to be touched.

I prefer to be called Rozengurtle by men.
Okay then... let's get ya started.
Okay, just cut off as much fat as you can as it goes by and the rule of thumb here is...
Rule of thumb?
Rule of thumb?
Yeah?
Yeah?
Do you know where that term comes from? In the early 1900's it was legal for men to beat their wives as long as they used a stick no wider than their thumb.
I knew you two pricks would give me problems. Give me shit cause I'm a woman. I'm not gonna take your male dominance bullshit!
Oh, come on now Rozengurtle. I was just tryin' ta get a rise outta ya.
Baumgartner sound Irish to you, fuck face?
Now look Rozengurtle, we're sorry. Just relax.
Holy shit. You're the first one that's ever got that.
Yeah, well... I'm an expert in name- ology.
And number three, Dolly.
Uh... two shooters!
Uh... two shooters!
Fan-fuckin-tastic!
So, what do we do now?
That depends. You either do your job or get ethical.
She was in here when it went down.
Can she I.D. them?
Can she I.D. them?
They were wearing masks.
They were wearing masks.
Of course they were. How many?
Of course they were. How many?
Three.
Only two did the shooting. So what are you thinking, Russian retaliation?
Nah, too quick half their infrastructure got taken out at the Copley plaza. Besides, if you're a hitter, you're either working for the Russians or the Italians. There's no riding the fence. Our little theory from last night just got blown to shit. Something... new is going on here.
Maybe the three of them had something in common.
No. This guy is big time. These two are street-walking scum.
And it's the same story over here. Why the crossover? Theories.
That's just fucking weird. I have no idea.
The shooter knew these guys, huh?
How do you figure?
How do you figure?
Friends, Gentlemen. They were friends.
No! Fuck you! You start getting excited! We gotta fucking go!
Rocco!

Really want to know?
So Duffy, got any theories to go with that... tie.
These guys were pros. I think they were coming for one target, the fag man, he was the...

Well, Freud was right. So you think they came for the fag man, huh? And what do you base this upon?

That's a possibility. Y'know you Boston cops are perking up. That's two sound theories in one day, neither of which deal with abnormally sized men. Another possibility is that they were placed there with religious intent.

The two bullets went in here, through the top of the skull, criss-crossed and exited through the eyeballs. This one clue tells us three distinct facts. Number one... Duffy.
They shot him at a downward angle. They put him on his knees.
They shot him at a downward angle. They put him on his knees.
Excellent! Number two. Greenly.
Now stay with me, boys. What did they do to make two such identical wounds? Did one guy put him on his knees, pop a cap in, sit him back up and shoot him again the same way? No. Two men of similar height dropped this guy down, each put some iron to his head and boom! That's all she fuckin' wrote!
What about one guy with two guns?
What about one guy with two guns?
Possible, but unlikely. The angles are too extreme. A guy holding two guns to the back of your head is gonna shoot straight ahead. He wouldn't cock out his elbows, makes no sense. Besides, you telling me one guy came in here and killed eight men with eight extremely well aimed shots in just a few seconds? No way. Had to be at least
Now, what is this going to look like to those who do not know what I just told you?
It's gonna look like the bad guys are killing each other.
It's gonna look like the bad guys are killing each other.
And is there an American, shit is there a man seated among us that hasn't thought about it many times, let's just put them all on an island, give them guns and let them kill each other. This is our wet dream come true. You can expect federal and local law enforcement to go only deep enough to satisfy the law, then bury it
Allow me to enlighten you gentlemen to the protocol of the porno industry, as I'm sure you've never been in one of these places before. A man goes into the booth, puts the money in the slot. The dancer gets it on the other side. She hits the button, door goes up, now there is only glass between you and it's little fireman time.
No way they could have seen it?
No way they could have seen it?
Those doors were down... which means this. They looked down in through the peep hole, saw these guys and opened the doors from the inside. Pop, pop, pop, right through the glass. Why?
Jesus. I just can't think anymore. That scene over at the coffee shop today tapped me out.
What?
What?
A guy went nuts over off of Commonwealth today. Shot three guys to death in a coffee shop in broad daylight. Fled the scene. Don't have much on him.
A guy went nuts over off of Commonwealth today. Shot three guys to death in a coffee shop in broad daylight. Fled the scene. Don't have much on him.
Why was I not informed of this?
These two fucking scenes are related. Too many coincidences. Same day? Five hours apart? Dead mobsters on both scenes. Now, why did he kill the bartender?
Crime of passion. He just went nuts. He would have shot everyone in here. He just ran out of bullets.
Crime of passion. He just went nuts. He would have shot everyone in here. He just ran out of bullets.
Duffy. This look like a fucking post office to you? This guy came in here with intent. Maybe he didn't know exactly what he was gonna do but he had a pretty good idea. The bartender wasn't a fucking accident.

Well, we didn't get any help on that. A lot of people saw it. Nobody's talking.
Well, we didn't get any help on that. A lot of people saw it. Nobody's talking.
Fucking figures. Look, are you guys seeing the pattern here? We got big questions at both of these crime scenes, with no answers. WHY did they kill the guys in the other two booths? WHY did he do the bartender? It would seem unnecessary, even stupid. God, I hate cold crime scenes! I'm fucking leaving now. And do me a favor, tell me when
That's one big fuckin' shoe!... and think about it. Of all the ways to kill a guy, crushin' him to death. That's very particular. You don't get many of those. I dunno. I feel something big here. I wouldn't be surprised if we see more of these turning up.
Brilliant. So now we got a Huge guy theory and Serial crusher theory. Top fucking notch. What's your name?

Sweet-n-low!
He's struck again, hasn't he, Greenly?
Why do you always disrespect me like that?
Why do you always disrespect me like that?
Respect is earned, Greenly, never given. Guys like you should have to follow me around squabbling for the scraps from my table.
How many bodies, Greenly?
Eight.
While Greenly's getting coffee, anybody else want anything?
Shit! Shit!
Uh. Shit, I, uh...
It tells us that he was the last to die. All these men Were carrying. They came in, dropped all in seconds and then took their time with fag man. Didn't they, Duffy?! They sure as fuck did!
After talking to the dancer we know that their mark was the guy in the middle booth. After she watches them whack him, she passes out. Why the two extra victims?
Witness?
Witness?
No way they could have seen it.
They weren't related. The guy used a 38. No pennies. Totally amateur.
Who were the victims?
Who were the victims?
A couple of peons for the mob and...
A couple of peons for the mob and...
Oh that's just BEAUTIFUL! All the scumbags in the quiet city of Boston start dropping dead and you think it's unrelated?! Greenly, the day I want the Boston Police doing my thinking for me, I will have a fucking tag on my toe! Now, get me a squad car and get me over there. I want the crime scene photos and any witness statements.

Those rat fucks! All of them were all laughing at me man!
You sure you killed them?
Liberating isn't it?
Y'know it is, a bit.
Vincenzo, that fat motherfucker, Yakavetta's right hand. He's the one who set me up. Then he went around shooting his mouth off, telling everyone I was as good as dead. He goes in there every Wednesday night around 10:00, he jerks off in the same booth to the same titty dancer. Never misses.
So?
So?
So let's kill the motherfucker. I mean, what are you guys... like that's your new thing right?
Well, truth be known, those first ones just kinda fell into our laps.
Well, what'ya do?
You look like Mush Mouth from Fat Albert.

Hey! We gotta talk about this early morning church shit.
We have to go now. We're on the lamb.
We'll keep going, Roc.
You'll make it outta here. You can't ever stop, not ever.
Hello? You there?
Y-Yes my son.
Why have you come to a church for council if you're not religious?
Why have I come to a church? I never have before. I guess I just... felt I should.
Why have I come to a church? I never have before. I guess I just... felt I should.
What is it my son?
What is it my son?
It's ethics. I put evil men behind bars, but the law has miles of red tape and loopholes for these... cocksuckers to slip through. I've found out there are these two young men who fix the situation with an iron fist. As if they have God's permission. But what they do is wrong and I should arrest them... technically.

God's permission? God doesn't...
But in this day and age I believe what they do is... necessary. I feel it is... correct.
You believe?
You believe?
Yes.
Yes.
You feel?
You feel?
Yes.
Yes.
You feel? A soul is what gives you feelings. Happiness, guilt, right or wrong. It is a conduit through which the Lord speaks to us. You felt that your answers would be here in the house of God today. You feel these men are necessary. The Lord has spoken to you twice this day.
Has he now?
You have entered the house of the Lord of your own free will speaking of beliefs and feelings. Is it so much to believe that God has brought you here?
You have entered the house of the Lord of your own free will speaking of beliefs and feelings. Is it so much to believe that God has brought you here?
I guess not.
I guess not.
It is easy to be sarcastic about religion. It is harder to take small hints from God, your feelings and listen to them... to take a stand.
You're right.
Those who do not act are in a constant state of ethical indecision.

I want to stand for what I believe in, father.

You know them personally?

Yes.
Yes.
Do you think they would harm an innocent man, for any reason?
Do you think they would harm an innocent man, for any reason?
No. They would never do that.
The laws of God are higher than the laws of man.
Yes! Yes! I was thinking that, too. No. I was feeling it. All I needed was to hear you say it! Amen! I'll help them.
Yes! Yes! I was thinking that, too. No. I was feeling it. All I needed was to hear you say it! Amen! I'll help them.
Forgive me father.

Have you no fear of God?
Have you no fear of God?
That's who I'm doing this for, now open the fuckin' thing.
Father, I'll do you right here.
God have mercy on my soul.
Do your thing Father. Don't fuck this up.
What do you want me to say?
What do you want me to say?
Just be natural, goddamit.
Just be natural, goddamit.
How long since your last confession, my son?
I wouldn't have, uh, killed you, Father. Dominus Ominus. Remember, you're bound. You can't talk about this... to anyone.
Just go!
Poppa Joe, you want me to go now?
Yeah. Thanks, Rocco. See ya.
Hey, Rocco, wait. Come back here.

Continue the joke.
He says, "What's your third wish?" And the guys says, "I-I want you to beat me half to death."
Well, it's the funny man. Give it here, package boy.

He's not there. Huggie Bear isn't in every single episode.
I think you might of dreamed this one, Anthony.
I think you might of dreamed this one, Anthony.
No. It's a real episode. The killer is leading him across the city by calling different pay phones.
Why?
As part of his plan. I don't know why.
As part of his plan. I don't know why.
See, that's what I'm saying. It has the logic of a dream.
See, that's what I'm saying. It has the logic of a dream.
The point is the killer always goes, May I speak to Starsky? He says his name.

Did you see what I meant about the window?
Kind of. Except we've already got the keys.
Kind of. Except we've already got the keys.
That's true. But what if they change the locks?
That's true. But what if they change the locks?
Would they do that?
Would they do that?
Who knows? That's why I filed it down.
Now that window can never be locked. It's impossible.
See, your mind is very good with the more mechanical details. Whereas my strength would be --
She's really kind of hot.
She's an attractive older woman.
It's got a V-8, Dignan.
What do you think the cops have?
Anthony, we'll get two hundred for the coin collection alone. That's less than what it's appraised at.
But Dignan, do you really know that much about rare coins?
But Dignan, do you really know that much about rare coins?
I know about money, Anthony. I know the value of money. Plus the earrings are worth three times that.
The list, Dignan. I know you remember the list because you signed it. "Things Dignan was not supposed to touch."
Every valuable item in the house was on that list.
Every valuable item in the house was on that list.
That doesn't make any difference. I bought those earrings for my mother on her birthday. They have a very special value for her.
That doesn't make any difference. I bought those earrings for my mother on her birthday. They have a very special value for her.
Yeah, but I can't be sorting through that shit in the middle of a burglary. There's just not time for it.
Yeah, but I can't be sorting through that shit in the middle of a burglary. There's just not time for it.
Then you shouldn't of gone in there, Dignan. Maybe we should of robbed your house. Did you ever think of that?
Where are you going?
I don't appreciate you ridiculing me.
I don't appreciate you ridiculing me.
How was I ridiculing you?
How was I ridiculing you?
You're making fun of my family. You know there's nothing to steal from my mom and Craig. You know exactly what you're saying.
You're making fun of my family. You know there's nothing to steal from my mom and Craig. You know exactly what you're saying.
That's not what I meant, Dignan.
Did you see that?
Yeah, I saw it.

I'm lookout.

Dignan, it's got an alarm.
Dignan, it's got an alarm.
I don't think so. Just reach on in.
I don't think so. Just reach on in.
That sets it off.
That sets it off.
No, just do it real quick. I'll meet you down there.
It had an alarm.
Yeah, I heard that.
Yeah, I heard that.
Five, seven, eight dollars.
Holy shit. What'd I tell you?
Eight dollars.
Eight dollars.
That's not bad.
But he didn't say anything.
Hang on a second.
Is it back in?
Yeah.
Loop around real fast.
Just turn right here.
OK. Escape route. The most important thing you can have is an escape route. Just in case somebody's tailing us. Or even chasing us, as the case may be --
You think we're going to be chased?
You think we're going to be chased?
That's a good question. No. I don't. I'm just being hypocritical here. However, I will say --
Now. One thing we need to discuss is timing. Timing is absolutely crucial. What are you doing? Anthony!
Nothing. Go ahead.
Anthony, give me the fucking gun!
No, Dignan. It's not your gun. It's all of ours.
Dignan, calm down.
You're out! I'm not working with either one of you!
You're out! I'm not working with either one of you!
Dignan! Stop!
Calm down. Take a deep breath.
You're right. You're right.
Where's the manager?
Where's the other stocker?
Where's the other stocker?
There's another stocker, right?
There's another stocker, right?
We know there's another stocker.
Is that the manager?
Unlock that door. Check the aisles.
Holy shit.
We got it. We got it.
What about what that guy said?
Oh, shit. That was scary. In the middle of the robbery. The manager looks at me. Right in the eye. And goes, I'm going to remember you.
I swear to God. In a very quiet voice.
Like he meant it.
Like he meant it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Like he would find Dignan. One day.
Like he would find Dignan. One day.
Like I'm going to hunt you down and kill you.
What's wrong with him?
What do you think?
What do you think?
Anthony, he sat in the car and watched a 4-11 in progress. He got what he deserved.

I didn't realize you were so sensitive to Bob's feelings. Considering I did the plans, you're actually lucky you got --
I didn't realize you were so sensitive to Bob's feelings. Considering I did the plans, you're actually lucky you got --
Don't even say it, man.
Can I get that credit card from you?
I don't like to use that credit card, Dignan.
I don't like to use that credit card, Dignan.
Why not?
Why not?
Because my mom gets the bill.
Because my mom gets the bill.
She's not going to notice, Anthony.
She's not going to notice, Anthony.
I don't want to use it.
I don't want to use it.
Well, then cut it in half.
Well, then cut it in half.
I keep it for emergencies.
I keep it for emergencies.
Anthony, we're on the run. This is an emergency. It's only fair that...
See if mine are in there.
Dignan, those aren't running shoes.
Dignan, those aren't running shoes.
Yes, they are.
Yes, they are.
Look at the treads on those.
Look at the treads on those.
What about them?
What about them?
They obviously weren't designed for racing.
They obviously weren't designed for racing.
Well, those treads stink. You'd blow a knee out racing on those.
Really. OK, Dad. But seriously, Anthony. These are fast shoes.
You've never had a pair of fast shoes in your life, Dignan. In fifth grade Dignan used to wear cowboy boots for P.E.
You've never had a pair of fast shoes in your life, Dignan. In fifth grade Dignan used to wear cowboy boots for P.E.
That's real cool, Anthony. Yeah, I wore boots. My parents wouldn't buy me any $200 running shoes like yours. I wasn't spoiled.
That's real cool, Anthony. Yeah, I wore boots. My parents wouldn't buy me any $200 running shoes like yours. I wasn't spoiled.
Don't call me spoiled, Dignan.
Don't call me spoiled, Dignan.
You were spoiled rotten.
I'll just say it.
I'll say it.
I'll say it.
OK. Go ahead.
OK. Go ahead.
On your marks... Get set go.
You owe me fifty bucks.
Bob?
Look, man. She didn't know anything about shirts.
No, I'm not saying her. I'm just saying, I don't know.
No, I'm not saying her. I'm just saying, I don't know.
It's a great shirt. Don't worry about it.
Armored trucks are very difficult to steal, Anthony.
I know. But once you get inside you're home free.
I know. But once you get inside you're home free.
Right. Get back to me on that one. Once your plan is worth a shit.
Right. Get back to me on that one. Once your plan is worth a shit.
It's not a plan. It's just --
It's not a plan. It's just --
Actually. If you knew the exact route, you could plant explosives under a manhole cover and blow it up as it went over.
Actually. If you knew the exact route, you could plant explosives under a manhole cover and blow it up as it went over.
Yeah, but you wouldn't have the truck if you blew it up.
Yeah, but you wouldn't have the truck if you blew it up.
True.
Dignan, I can't get my hair cut. That's just not possible, all right?
Then you're going to have to dye it, Anthony. We've got to hide our identities. Especially after Bob crashed the car.
No, Dignan. I'm sorry. I can't do that.
Even if it's the difference between some trooper recognizing us and throwing us in prison or not?
I thought you guys went to get your hair cut.
No. We didn't.
This is Inez. Carmen. Anita.
Hi.
Hi.
Inez, this is --
Inez, this is --
Jerry. And this is my associate Cornelius.
May I have a word with you, please?
Sure.
What the fuck is going on here?
What. What's the matter?
What. What's the matter?
Anthony, we're on the run from the law here. Did you tell these people your real name?
Anthony, we're on the run from the law here. Did you tell these people your real name?
No. I didn't. Dignan, they don't speak English.
No. I didn't. Dignan, they don't speak English.
They don't?
They don't?
No. Not really. Inez speaks a little.
No. Not really. Inez speaks a little.
Which one was that?
Which one was that?
On the left.
She's from Cuba.
No kidding.
He needs to hire an attorney.
No, no. Look. OK. Let's stay here until we find out what's going on.
Now that makes sense. We'll hang out for a couple of days. Get a little R&R. Make sure Future Man's OK and then get back on the road.
As long as he gets out OK.
As long as he gets out OK.
Obviously. That's a given.
Obviously. That's a given.
Bob?
See, now we've got a plan.
Don't worry about it, Bob.
See, one day we were playing hot box over at my next door neighbor Mr. Langston's house and Anthony fell in the pool and got knocked unconscious. I had to dive in and save him.
This was in fourth grade.
This was in fourth grade.
Mr. Langston performed cardiopulmonary recitation. CPR. I've never said this before, but frankly I thought Anthony was dead. The veins in his face were all sticking out. His skin was blue. He truly did look dead.
Mr. Langston performed cardiopulmonary recitation. CPR. I've never said this before, but frankly I thought Anthony was dead. The veins in his face were all sticking out. His skin was blue. He truly did look dead.
After that my parents never let me go to Dignan's again.
After that my parents never let me go to Dignan's again.
They blamed my family for everything. They always said Mr. Langston saved Anthony's life.
But if it wasn't for Dignan I probably would of died.
Yes... It's true.
He's gone. He stole the car.
Where was it parked?
Where was it parked?
Right here.
That coward. Son of a bitch.
Maybe he just went to the store.
Maybe he just went to the store.
He took his stuff. He's gone. I should of seen this. I should of expected it. Bob doesn't have any character.
He went back for his brother.
We said 48 hours.
We said 48 hours.
That's a long time to be in jail.
When'd he tell you?
This morning.
This morning.
Where was I?
Where was I?
You were asleep.
You were asleep.
He told you and you let him do it.
He told you and you let him do it.
He told me because he wanted to know if I wanted to go.

If you wanted to go? What were you going to do? Just leave me here by myself?
If you wanted to go? What were you going to do? Just leave me here by myself?
Well, I didn't do it, did I?
Well, I didn't do it, did I?
So when you were saying Bob's at the store and acting real surprised, that was just an act. You were just --

Bob went to help his brother. I understand that and I can't help it if you don't.
Bob went to help his brother. I understand that and I can't help it if you don't.
I understand that if I had a few more friends like you and Bob I'd be dead.
I understand that if I had a few more friends like you and Bob I'd be dead.
If you say so.
If you'd gone with Bob you'd probably be in Weatherford by now. Of course I'd be here frantically worrying thinking you must of got kidnapped.
I didn't realize you had such an incredible ability to feel sorry for yourself, Dignan.
I didn't realize you had such an incredible ability to feel sorry for yourself, Dignan.
Well, the world is a little bit colder today.
We're going over to this bar if you feel like going.
No. I'm going to swim. I'll see you later.
Why don't you come with us.
OK.
I can't believe he just jumped you.
Can you hand me those french fries.
I wish I'd been there.
Would of been nice.
Man. I'm sorry. We just went for a walk --
I don't really feel like talking about it. The only thing I feel like is getting the fuck out of this place.
I don't really feel like talking about it. The only thing I feel like is getting the fuck out of this place.
We need a car.
I have an idea for that.
What?
What?
Inez has a master key to all these rooms, doesn't she? Doesn't she?
Inez has a master key to all these rooms, doesn't she? Doesn't she?
I don't think we can do that.
I don't think we can do that.
I know we can. It's real simple. We go into a room, grab some car keys and --
I know we can. It's real simple. We go into a room, grab some car keys and --
What I'm saying is she wouldn't go for that.
What I'm saying is she wouldn't go for that.
She doesn't need to know.
She doesn't need to know.
I don't know, Dignan. I just --
I don't know, Dignan. I just --
Look. I'm ready to get the fuck out of here. It's real torture for me to be here. Getting the shit kicked out of me by Mexicans.
Look. I'm ready to get the fuck out of here. It's real torture for me to be here. Getting the shit kicked out of me by Mexicans.
Shh.
Shh.
No one to back me up. Now I have a good idea. So unless you come up with something better --
No one to back me up. Now I have a good idea. So unless you come up with something better --
Dignan. I can't do that. All right? I just can't.
I don't think we need any keys, Dignan. I think I can hotwire a car for us.
You don't know how to hotwire.
You don't know how to hotwire.
Yes, I do. Bob taught me.
Yes, I do. Bob taught me.
Bob taught you how to get electrocuted.
Bob taught you how to get electrocuted.
No, I'm serious. He made me a diagram.
I think we better go home.
Don't panic, Anthony.
Don't panic, Anthony.
I'm not. But there's --
I'm not. But there's --
You can't just run home every time things get tough. First of all, we've got enough dough to --
You can't just run home every time things get tough. First of all, we've got enough dough to --
Our money situation is not good.

You're so spoiled. What is "not good" to you? Only a few hundred --
You're so spoiled. What is "not good" to you? Only a few hundred --
We've got sixteen dollars.
We've got sixteen dollars.
That's not correct.
Sixteen dollars.
I know.
I know.
Where's the rest?
I had to give some to Inez.
How much?
How much?
$383.
You gave $383 to the goddamn housekeeper! What the fuck is your problem?
She needed it.
She needed it.
A $500 tip! For the housekeeper!
A $500 tip! For the housekeeper!
Her name's Inez. Stop calling her the housekeeper.
Her name's Inez. Stop calling her the housekeeper.
That's what she is!
That's what she is!
I know that. But --
I know that. But --
You're in love with the fucking housekeeper!
You're in love with the fucking housekeeper!
Shut up!
Shut up!
What are you going to do, get married? Have a bunch of little idiot janitor brats! And go around scrubbing the --
When'd you get back?
Ah. Couple days ago.
Who's in the car?
That's Applejack. You want to meet him?
That's Applejack. You want to meet him?
Sure.
Applejack would of got him anyway. This was just the quicker way.
You really hit a guy with a bottle?
I want you to look at this.
What is it?
What is it?
It's big, Anthony. Real big. It's called Hinckley Cold Storage.
It's big, Anthony. Real big. It's called Hinckley Cold Storage.
What's Hinckley Cold Storage?
Mr. Henry has an inside source. We call him Steve. That's where we get our information.
Who's Mr. Henry?
Who's Mr. Henry?
You'll meet him this afternoon. He's helping us set it up.
What exactly is this place? Freezers?
Right. Freezers. Imported foods.
What time did he say to be here?
Right now.
You could give somebody a concussion.
Let me feel that.
What do you think?
He seems pretty good.
Dignan. Take it easy.
Bob!
He doesn't want to fight.
Get out of the way.
Get out of the way.
No, Dignan. This isn't --
No fighting. It wasn't Bob's fault.
Easy, Dignan. It's OK.
Shit, Dignan.
What the fuck are we doing out here?
What the fuck are we doing out here?
I don't know, Dignan. You went crazy.
I don't know, Dignan. You went crazy.
I'm sorry, Bob.
OK. Man in blue jeans just left by southwest door. He is entering a white van. What time is it?
Eleven fifteen.
Eleven fifteen.
OK. Mark that down.
OK. Mark that down.
I did.
God. Isn't this great? Working on the job. Got a wheel man. Got a safecracker. Good friends with Mr. Henry.
Yeah. It's pretty good.
Yeah. It's pretty good.
It's like we've finally arrived.
Next week we'll be drinking piña coladas.
Hopefully this trip'll go a little smoother than the last one.
Or I might end up with a broken nose.
Did that hurt?
I'll try not to hold you back tomorrow.
I don't think you will.
I don't think you will.
I don't want to be too much of a liability.
I don't want to be too much of a liability.
Look, you're going to do fine. It's OK to be scared.
Look, you're going to do fine. It's OK to be scared.
I don't think I ever said this to you. But it meant a lot to me the way you were after that Swifty stuff happened.
He was a nice guy.
He was all right.
Do you like Inez?
As a person?
As a person?
Yeah. As a girl.
Yeah. As a girl.
Yes. I do.
Yes. I do.
So do I.
Bird Dog to Scarecrow. Bird Dog to Scarecrow.
Go ahead, Bird Dog.
Go ahead, Bird Dog.
You're all clear.
You're all clear.
Roger.

We all set?
We all set?
Hang on a second.
Uh-huh?
Take your second position.
Take your second position.
OK. Roger.
I'm in position, Scarecrow.
Any activity?
Any activity?
Not at all. The place is totally deserted.

Good. It's supposed to be.

I've got a great view up here. I can see all the --
I've got a great view up here. I can see all the --
Stand by, Bird Dog.
I don't know.
Check the fucking elevator. It's moving.
What's happening? What's going on?
It was Bob. His walkie talkie's busted.
Who did that? What the fuck is that?
It's going back down.
It's going back down.
Applejack! What's happening?
Freeze!
Nobody move!
Nobody move!
Get against the wall!
Help me move him.
Careful. Check his pulse.
Who tripped the alarm?
It's the fire alarm. Somebody pulled the fire alarm.
It's the fire alarm. Somebody pulled the fire alarm.
Where's Kumar?
Where's Kumar?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Jesus Christ, Anthony. Did you lose him?
What are you doing?
Let's go. Come on.
Wait for Kumar.
Come on, Kumar.
You're kidding.
Applejack's stuck in the elevator?
Come on.
I'll see you there.
I'll see you there.
What?
What?
I'll see you there.
I'll see you there.
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
I'll get him.
I'll get him.
There's not enough time.
There's not enough time.
Yes, there is. Let's get organized.
Dignan, it's too late.
I don't think so.
Like amnesia.
Can't remember shit. CRS.
So is Mr. Henry going to come by and see me or anything?
I don't think so. I mean. Actually, he robbed Bob's house.
I don't think so. I mean. Actually, he robbed Bob's house.
He did?
He did?
Yeah.
Yeah.
You got to be kidding me.
You got to be kidding me.
I'm not kidding.
I'm not kidding.
What'd he get?
What'd he get?
Pretty much everything.
Pretty much everything.
The grandfather clock?
You think Applejack knew?
We haven't heard from Applejack since he got out of the hospital. His case got dismissed.
Why?
We're not sure.
Mr. Henry never gave you a test, did he?
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
Nothing.
You're living on a sailboat?
It belongs to Bob's uncle.
It belongs to Bob's uncle.
How big is it?
How big is it?
Oh, I'd say about --
Where?
Behind Bob's house.
Does it float?
We're not sure yet. It's going to need some repairs.
So how is it in there?
What can I say? It's jail. You don't sleep when you want to. You don't eat when you want to.
What's he in for?
He stole a tractor.
I think I may have found a way out of here.
You're kidding.
You're kidding.
No. I'm not.
No. I'm not.
How?
How?
Shhh. Wait for my instructions.
Shhh. Wait for my instructions.
Dignan, I --
When we go through the next gate you'll have 30 seconds to take out the tower guard.
What?
What?
Have the car running at the north- west checkpoint. Bob and I'll --
Have the car running at the north- west checkpoint. Bob and I'll --
Dignan, I --
Scale the barricade and tunnel through no man's land. And Bob. Remember:
Scale the --
Scale the --
Shield me from the bullets. They won't shoot civilians. Ready?
This is my business manager, Rowboat.
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
That's a sharp jacket.
That's a sharp jacket.
Thanks.
It's hard to get much spin with this kind of paddle.
It's called a racquet, Anthony, and you're holding it wrong. That's ghetto play. Hold it like this.
You know, your form is for shit, but you've got a hell of a talent.
Thanks.
Every once in a while some cat comes to me. He wants to know how I made it. How did I become a success? The first thing I tell them is: follow your instincts. Let your instincts guide you. The second thing I tell them is, for Christ's sake: you got to know your grammar.
Grammar.
You mean like techniques?
Technique. That's right. Seventy- five percent of your job is crowd control. Seventy-five percent. Do you believe that?
I'd like to live in that place. Hinckley Cold Storage.
Yeah. Convert it into lofts. OK. Pop quiz. What's the single most important aspect of your job?
You mean a safecracker?
Yeah. And I'll tell you who we're going to want: Kumar Banijamali.
Look at that woman. She's what? Fifty? Fifty-five? But she hasn't let herself go. I appreciate an older woman who has a commitment to her body.
So do I.
Tell me something. What the hell kind of name is Dignan?
I'm not really sure. I think it's Irish. Or maybe --
I'm not really sure. I think it's Irish. Or maybe --
I guess what I'm trying to say is what the hell kind of person is this Dignan?
I guess what I'm trying to say is what the hell kind of person is this Dignan?
What do you mean what kind of person? He's a good person.
What do you mean what kind of person? He's a good person.
Sure, sure. He's a great person, and I'd call bullshit on anybody who said differently. But I wonder if the kid has the goods up here.
Sure, sure. He's a great person, and I'd call bullshit on anybody who said differently. But I wonder if the kid has the goods up here.
I don't think you're giving him enough credit. I know sometimes he doesn't think an idea through. He gets too excited. But --
I don't think you're giving him enough credit. I know sometimes he doesn't think an idea through. He gets too excited. But --
As far as I can tell he hasn't thought his life through. He'd be fine cutting my grass or parking my car. But business? You I can work with. You I could groom. Dignan's not going to make it.
And you're wrong if you think, I'd turn my back on a friend.
Hold it.
Congratulations. You passed the test.
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
The Abe Henry double-cross test. You just made a perfect score.
That was a test?
Take a deep breath.
How does that feel?
It feels good.
Did Dignan take the test?
Yes, he did.
Yes, he did.
How'd he do?
Well, he agreed 100% that Bob should be dropped. And he also agreed you were a liability. But he felt his talent would make up for your weaknesses.
That sounds like Dignan.
I'll tell you, Anthony. Times like this I get philosophical. What does it mean? What's it all about? Are you afraid to die?
Me?
Me?
No, that door over there.
No, that door over there.
I don't want to die.
I don't want to die.
Are you afraid?
Are you afraid?
Yeah. I mean, I don't think about it all the time. But once in awhile I kind of go, Woah. Man.
Yeah. I mean, I don't think about it all the time. But once in awhile I kind of go, Woah. Man.
Exactly. Woah.
Exactly. Woah.
Death.
Death.
The fear of death, The pain of consciousness. Did you mix this martini?
The fear of death, The pain of consciousness. Did you mix this martini?
No. Bob did.
No. Bob did.
Bob. Bob. That's a palindrome. I love palindromes.
Bob. Bob. That's a palindrome. I love palindromes.
Are you afraid to die, Mr. Henry?
Are you afraid to die, Mr. Henry?
Anthony, I'm petrified.
This is good.
I want to ask a favor, boys. One day, when I'm long gone and all but forgotten, make one last toast to Abe Henry. And remember me as a friend.
But you're thieves. It's what you are.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's an esoteric journey.
We're renegades from despair.
Can I ask you something, Mr. Henry?
Can I ask you something, Mr. Henry?
Absolutely.
Absolutely.
Why'd you want to help us?
Why'd you want to help us?
Because I was like you once. And there was no one there to help me.
Future Man.
Who?
Who?
Future Man. You know. Cause he looks like he's from the future.
Did you ever steal a car before?
Yeah. I've stolen two cars before. One Jaguar. And one Trans-Am. With T- Tops. That Trans-Am was fun to drive.
What do herbs have to do with it? I don't understand the --
Pot is an herb. It's just like any type of gardening.
In your backyard? How do you protect them?
It's private property. Plus I have Hector.
It's private property. Plus I have Hector.
Hector woudn't do anything.
Hector woudn't do anything.
But he's got a loud bark. That's the most important thing is a loud bark.
Could you grow cinnamon?
I don't know. Sure, I guess.
I don't know. Sure, I guess.
You could make your own cinnamon toast.
Let them fight.
Let them fight.
Are you serious?
Yeah. He said that.
See you.
See you, Bob.
You'll probably have them the rest of your life.
What was that?
What the fuck is Dignan doing with that cop? He loves them.
There's a million places to hide around here.
There's a million places to hide around here.
Oh, yeah. They'll never catch the guy.
Oh, yeah. They'll never catch the guy.
I hope not.
I hope not.
Phil probably provoked him. Where's he going?
Where you going?
Move.
Why don't you just tell them the truth. Those belong to my neighbor Phil.
I don't know. I personally don't need that shit in my life right now.
I don't know. I personally don't need that shit in my life right now.
Nobody does.
Will you guys shut up? God. It's like having two little kids in the car.
OK, Dad.
You think he got my license plates?
He looked too shaken-up.
How long are they going to hold him?
I don't know. I don't know anything. Except Phil says they got him. And he's in jail.
Anthony, I --
And if Future Man doesn't get let out of jail in 48 hours, then we go back. All right?
What?
Is that OK?
Bob, where you going?
I'm not playing any more golf.
I'm not playing any more golf.
Why not?
Why not?
Cause I'm not getting any better. It's a waste of time.
Cause I'm not getting any better. It's a waste of time.
You've only been playing for two weeks, Bob. It takes a long time to learn this game.
You've only been playing for two weeks, Bob. It takes a long time to learn this game.
You think I'm improving?
You think I'm improving?
Yes. You just got to stick with it.
You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.
No, I don't mind.
No, I don't mind.
I know it must of been a bad experience. But it doesn't sound like it was your fault.
I know it must of been a bad experience. But it doesn't sound like it was your fault.
Well, I didn't mean to electrocute him. But the whole operation was my idea.
It took six months of research. I did all the wiring myself. Switched AC to DC. Doubled the voltage. Shorted out the generator. The whole school was shut down.
That's pretty complicated for a senior prank.
That's pretty complicated for a senior prank.
I don't like that word prank, Bob. I was trying to do something more than a prank.
At first they were going to charge me with manslaughter. That's partly why I was in custody so long. Sixty days.
Sixty days?
Sixty days?
Yeah. One minute you're studying Great Expectations and the next minute you're drawing the Holy Mary for some kid who tried to stab his girlfriend.
Yeah. One minute you're studying Great Expectations and the next minute you're drawing the Holy Mary for some kid who tried to stab his girlfriend.
Why were you drawing the Holy Mary?
Why were you drawing the Holy Mary?
Prison tatoos. I got to be pretty good. It's not like drawing on paper.
I thought he didn't have to pay anything because of the technicality.
Yeah, but he still has the aggravation. Three days sitting in a cell.
Yeah, but he still has the aggravation. Three days sitting in a cell.
Were you adopted, Bob?
Were you adopted, Bob?
Why do you say that?
Why do you say that?
Well, because you guys don't look alike.
Well, because you guys don't look alike.
No. I wasn't adopted.
Was Future Man adopted?
Jesus Christ! No.
Let's not even talk about it.
It was stupid.
Yeah. Let's keep it --
Cause you would of let my brother rot in jail.
Give him a second.
Hopscotch. The code name is hopscotch.
You OK, Bob?
No, I'm having a heart attack. Of course, I'm OK. What's that supposed to mean?
No, I'm having a heart attack. Of course, I'm OK. What's that supposed to mean?
Nothing. I was just asking.
No, I know. I'm just saying. I feel fine. You want a piece of cake?
Sure.
What are you doing?
My walkie talkie's busted. I can't tell what's going on.
My walkie talkie's busted. I can't tell what's going on.
Let me see it. Did you drop it?
Let me see it. Did you drop it?
No.
Jesus, Bob.
I didn't do anything.
Yeah.
Who's got the car keys?
We think Mr. Henry maybe --
His health isn't very good, you know. They take that into account.
It's in the driveway.
Temporarily.
How do you say nineteen?
Dies y nueve.
Dies y nueve.
Right. Yeah. Yo soy dies y nueve. How old are you?
Are you ever scared of finding a dead body in one of these rooms?
No.
No.
It could happen. This is the exact kind of place where it happens. But I don't want to scare you.
Were you born in Mexico?
Cuba.
Cuba.
Oh, really? That's interesting. Do you prefer Cuba or the United States?
Does my skin feel soft, Anthony?
God, yes. Like silk.
What? What?
Like silk?
Like silk?
God. That does sound corny. Oh, your skin feels so soft and silky. But it really kind of does.
Nice to meet you, Applejack.
You're Anthony?
You're Anthony?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I hear you're a good thief.
Did you ever hear of the S. Cooper Trust robbery?
Uh-uh.
Uh-uh.
S. Cooper Trust, in San Francisco?
S. Cooper Trust, in San Francisco?
Uh-uh.
Let's go, Abdul-Shabazz.
Abdul-Shabazz?
I can knock a man out with a six inch punch.
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
Feel this.
Where'd they come from?
The front stairs.
The front stairs.
Where were you?
There's a lot of valuable shit in there, Applejack. The silver and the china. The crystal. And the grandfather clock. Goddammit, I bet that clock's worth ten grand.
Why the fuck do we need to blow up the car? It doesn't make any goddamn sense.
Why the fuck do we need to blow up the car? It doesn't make any goddamn sense.
Just settling an old score. You might say revenge.
Just settling an old score. You might say revenge.
That sounds like a lot of bullshit that'll land us in jail.
That sounds like a lot of bullshit that'll land us in jail.
We might have to take that chance. Cause I feel pretty strongly about this.
We might have to take that chance. Cause I feel pretty strongly about this.
Is that Buckethead?
Is that him?
Wait a second.
That's Anthony.
That's your friend Anthony?
That's your friend Anthony?
Yeah.
Yeah.
What's he doing here?
What's he doing here?
Looks like he's staying with Buckethead. That's what I figured. He's probably got his own room. Let's see where he's going.
Wait. Did he see us?
We're going too slow. It looks like we're following him.
Mr. Henry pulled that job in 1965. It's famous. Applejack was the wheel man. Did you use this same car, Applejack?
Hell, no. This is a '72. I was driving a '63 Pontiac.
I don't know why the fuck we're having a party. The damn job's not over yet.
Well, this isn't really a party per se.
Well, this isn't really a party per se.
You don't celebrate til it's over.
You don't celebrate til it's over.
True.
What?
Bob! Get back in position!
Are you a fag?
You're the faggot.
Dignan and Anthony, this is Little Richard. He's crazy. Totally nuts.
I don't know about that.
I don't know about that.
Little Richard. Trust me. You're insane. Jesus, this guy used to carry a percussion bomb around in his trunk. You do not want a guy like that loose on the streets.
Little Richard. Trust me. You're insane. Jesus, this guy used to carry a percussion bomb around in his trunk. You do not want a guy like that loose on the streets.
It seemed like a good idea at the time.
It seemed like a good idea at the time.
The one and only Little Richard.
Well, what do you think?
I don't know, Bob. What about one of those?
I'm not allowed to drive those.
Not even for emergencies?
Not even for emergencies?
No.
No.
I thought your parents were in Italy.
I thought your parents were in Italy.
They are.
They are.
So who's going to know?
So who's going to know?
My brother.
He looks like he was designed by scientists. For desert warfare.
That never would of --
That never would of --
Let's cut the bullshit.
If you're that worried, maybe we should just steal one.
What are you talking about, Bob?
What are you talking about, Bob?
Can you use a coaster.
You stole a Trans-Am.
Yes. I did.
Yes. I did.
OK, Bob.
OK, Bob.
It's true, Dignan.
It's true, Dignan.
Well. What do you want to do? You want to steal one or just drive your car?
Well. What do you want to do? You want to steal one or just drive your car?
I'll just drive my car.
How much could you grow? Realistically.
As much as I want. When these plants bud I'll probably have about six thousand dollars worth of weed.
As much as I want. When these plants bud I'll probably have about six thousand dollars worth of weed.
Six thousand dollars? Come on, Bob.
Six thousand dollars? Come on, Bob.
You should take a look. I have an entire crop in my backyard.
If it's that easy why doesn't everybody grow them?
Good question.
Don't you guys tell anybody about my plants.
You're paranoid, Bob.
You're paranoid, Bob.
Yeah, but don't tell anybody.
What was that all about?
I can't believe you said that.
I can't believe you said that.
What did I say?
What did I say?
I told you he's crazy.
The guy is fucking insane.
I warned you, Dignan.
I warned you, Dignan.
You said it like it was a big joke, Bob. Like he's wild.
You said it like it was a big joke, Bob. Like he's wild.
No, I was saying crazy like a lunatic.
No, I was saying crazy like a lunatic.
I know that now. He's a fucking psycho.
I know that now. He's a fucking psycho.
Well, don't blame me. I told you.
Well, don't blame me. I told you.
I do blame you, Bob. And woah. Look at her.
Where'd she go?
Maybe she turned.
I think we might of scared her.
Let's just go.
I'm going to take a look at this.
Hang on. This is important, Bob. Anthony and I are responsible for the internal situation. The money and the people. You're responsible for the external situation. The streets and the getaway.
Hang on. This is important, Bob. Anthony and I are responsible for the internal situation. The money and the people. You're responsible for the external situation. The streets and the getaway.
That's my responsibility.
That's my responsibility.
That's your domain.
That's your domain.
OK.
Bob.
I'm paying attention. I just want to look at it for a minute.
I'm paying attention. I just want to look at it for a minute.
What's your fucking problem? You're a shithead!
What's your fucking problem? You're a shithead!
I just want to see how much bullets it takes.
I paid for it.
God DAMMIT.
He doesn't get it. Held never understand what we're trying to accomplish here. It's too dangerous for him.
Well, in reality it's not that dangerous, Bob. It's only dangerous if you don't know what you're doing.
Well, in reality it's not that dangerous, Bob. It's only dangerous if you don't know what you're doing.
Yeah, but what if some nut pulled gun on you?
You know, Bob, Anthony did kill someone. He electrocuted our janitor senior year.
He electrocuted someone?
He electrocuted someone?
It was an accidental. I don't want to go into the details. It was just one of those senior pranks that didn't really go right. I mean, obviously, since Swifty's dead. That's why Anthony never graduated.
It was an accidental. I don't want to go into the details. It was just one of those senior pranks that didn't really go right. I mean, obviously, since Swifty's dead. That's why Anthony never graduated.
His name was Swifty?
His name was Swifty?
Yeah. One of the nicest old guys you'd ever know.
Yeah. One of the nicest old guys you'd ever know.
That's too bad.
That's too bad.
You know, when somebody gets electrocuted, their skin starts smoking. At least Swifty's did.
What are you doing?
I'm putting a piece of tape on my nose.
What happened?
Shhh. Slow down, Bob. Drive natural.
Shhh. Slow down, Bob. Drive natural.
This is natural.
This is natural.
That's good. Keep it at forty.
That's good. Keep it at forty.
Did we get it?
Did we get it?
Be cool, Bob. Be cool. Make that light.
How much is there?
Don't count it.
Was Dignan screaming like, Get me a bag!
No. I was calm.
You really think he'll remember you?
No. All he'll remember is a guy with a piece of tape on his nose.
Bob, will you please listen?
I don't want to talk about it.
I mean, Jesus Christ, Bob. You didn't have some vicious lunatic screaming, "I'm going to remember you!"
That's true. That would give me nightmares.
That's true. That would give me nightmares.
Bob, I've got nightmares.
Way to go, Bob!
I told you they were there.
I told you they were there.
So it's my fault?
In all probability nothing would of happened. But why take the chance? That's why I ran. I mean how many plants were even back there? Five? Ten?
There were more than that.
Shit, Bob. What the fuck did you do that for?
He wouldn't move.
Is he chasing us?
I don't know.
I'm sure he did. We'll have to get new plates.
It's registered in my mother's name.
It's registered in my mother's name.
What the fuck possessed you?
What the fuck possessed you?
You're the one who kept saying ram him.
Bob. Are you coming?
See you in a little while.
You can go first, Bob.
My brother's in jail.
My brother's in jail.
What are you talking about?
The weed.
But it's not his. How can they arrest Future Man?
But it's not his. How can they arrest Future Man?
They said he's a drug dealer.
I don't think they can make it stick, Bob. I mean, what do they actually have on Future Man?
Well, the marijuana crop is a good start.
Well, the marijuana crop is a good start.
That could be anybody's.

So tell them the truth. What do you use it for?
So tell them the truth. What do you use it for?
I was just going to use it to see how much I had.
How long has he been in there?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Then how come they haven't set the bail yet? That's unconstitutional.
Then how come they haven't set the bail yet? That's unconstitutional.
We'll have to see when we get back.
What do you mean get back?
Well, obviously, we got to go back.
Well, obviously, we got to go back.
Bob, that makes no sense.
Bob, that makes no sense.
Dignan, he's my brother. I can't just leave him there.
Dignan, he's my brother. I can't just leave him there.
This could be a trap.

Come on, Dignan.

Don't "Come on, Dignan" me.

I'm going back.

Not in that car you're not.

Watch me.

Good luck, since I got the keys.
Give me the keys, Dignan.
I can't do that, Bob.
I can't do that, Bob.
Dignan. You're going to give me those keys or you're going to get hurt.
Dignan. You're going to give me those keys or you're going to get hurt.
Don't threaten me, Bob.
Don't threaten me, Bob.
Goddammit, Dignan! It's my car! If you don't give me my keys, I swear to God --
Future Man would never go to jail for you, I'll tell you that.
His name's not Future Man, Dignan.
His name's not Future Man, Dignan.
I know it's not.

You don't even know his name.

Yes, I do.

What is it?

Just get in the car, Bob.
Just get in the car, Bob.
What's his name?
What's his name?
OK, Bob. I don't know his name. You know why? Because I don't care. He's Future Man. But I care about you. And to me it doesn't make sense to go back to the scene of a crime. Will you get in the car, Bob? This is stupid.
It's not your decision and he's not your brother, Dignan.
That's right. I only have one vote. We'll go talk with Anthony and figure it out.
You've got a beautiful walk, Bob.
Let's go.
Dignan.
Anthony. Bad news.
Hey, Dignan. How's it going?
Not bad.
Not bad.
Come on in. What you been up to?
Come on in. What you been up to?
Not a whole lot, Bob.
It's too bad about what happened on the road.
Yeah. It is.
Right. It was extremely stupid.
I don't expect an apology and I don't even want one. I just want us to --
I don't expect an apology and I don't even want one. I just want us to --
I can't fucking believe this guy. An apology, Bob?
I can't fucking believe this guy. An apology, Bob?
Man, I don't want to go into this.
You said 48 hours!
I never agreed to that.
I never agreed to that.
Bob, you're lying!
Bob, you're lying!
Bullshit.
Bullshit.
All right! Backyard! Right now!
Come on!
I don't want to fight you, Dignan.
It wasn't your fault, Bob. You had your brother.
I didn't have any choice.
I'm sorry, Bob.
That's OK.
That's OK.
Look. We want you on the job.
Come on, Bob.
I know it, man. Hang on.
I know it, man. Hang on.
Jesus Christ.

Yeah?
Everything OK?

It looks pretty good. There's nobody back here.
It looks pretty good. There's nobody back here.
Stand by. Bird Dog?
I couldn't hear anything.
Who's watching the door? What the fuck are you doing? Get back in position.
What's wrong with Applejack?
He's having a heart attack or something.
He's having a heart attack or something.
Let's go!
Is he breathing?
I think so.
Jesus Christ. What the fuck is that?
I didn't think there was an alarm.

Take him to the car, Bob.
The elevator broke.
Where's Applejack?
Where's Applejack?
He's stuck between two floors.
Applejack drove.
Run. Run. Let's go.
I said to the DA, That cop who hit me must of given me CRS disease.
What's that?
What's that?
That's just what the DA asked. CRS is a disease where you can't remember shit.
Do you have your own room?
We don't have rooms, Bob. We have cells.
We don't have rooms, Bob. We have cells.
Do you have your own cell?
Do you have your own cell?

Do they let you --
I don't really want to talk about it, Bob.
Hold on --
Here we go.
Here we go.
Wait a second --
Wait a second --
Now!
How's that 700 bucks coming?
I'm working on it.
I'm working on it.
Hard to find it sitting by the pool drinking beer and bullshitting.
Fancy seeing you here, Bob.
Yeah. Hey, Clay.
I might have mentioned it.
John, I'm twenty-six years old I didn't run away from home.
John, I'm twenty-six years old I didn't run away from home.

I'd appreciate it if you didn't go around telling people lies about me.
I'd appreciate it if you didn't go around telling people lies about me.
Right. I'm sorry. You've got a reputation to think about.
How you doing, Bob?
Hey, Jackson. How's it going?
You keeping out of trouble?
I'm trying.
I'm trying.
This boy's a troublemaker. He used to tear this place apart.
Your brother was up here the other day. He said you ran away from home.
He said what?
He said what?
He said you ran away from home.
He said you ran away from home.
No. I didn't run away. I went out of town.

You're going to need a boxman for this one. But that can be arranged.
Is he good?
He's damn good.
Join the party, fellas.
We're just going over a few things.
You got to have fun with it. There's no point if you're not having any fun. Would you like me to be there tomorrow?
Yes.
Yes.
Why?
Why?
Well, I think --
Well, I think --
No, if I go out on this job, then it's just another score by Mr. Henry. And I don't see it like that. This is your job. Your creation. I want you to try this.
Where did he go?
Who? Applejack?
Who? Applejack?
Why did he go that way?
Why did he go that way?
He's going to watch the back stairwell, remember? Don't worry about it.
What's the story?
Can't get it. It won't...
Can't get it. It won't...
What can we do?

Good to know you, John.
The world needs dreamers, son.

Well, we'll see you later, Bob.
Pleasure to meet you, John.
Pleasure to meet you, John.
Nice to meet you.
You told me Bourne was dead.
There was a mistake.
There was a mistake.
I'll say. You killed his goddam girlfriend instead. Now they're onto Neski. They're at the Brecker Hotel even as we speak.

Will it track back to us?

No. The files are spotless. Whatever they find, it's just going to make Conklin look worse.

Anything else?
Neski was a roadblock. Without me, there's no company, no fortune. You owe me, Uri. One last push.
One last push. One.
Leaving was a business decision. We're both rich, come enjoy it.

Save it for Bourne.

What?
He left yesterday on the night train. He's probably just getting in now. You'll have to hurry.
Bourne comes here? Why?
Treadstone.
Never heard of it.
Never heard of it.
That's not gonna fly.
That's not gonna fly.
With all due respect, Pam, I think you might've wandered a little past your pay-grade.
And what are we looking for?
I want to know about Treadstone.
I want to know about Treadstone.
To know about it? It was a kill squad. Black on black. Closed down two years ago. Nobody wants to know about Treadstone. Not around here. You better take this back to Marty and make sure he knows what you're doing.

He does. I've been down to the archives. I have the files, Ward.
Let's talk about Conklin.
What are you after, Pam? You want to fry me? You want my desk? Is that it?

I want to know what happened.
I want to know what happened.
What happened? Jason Bourne happened. You've got the files? Then let's cut the crap. It went wrong. Conklin had these guys wound so tight they were bound to snap. Bourne was his number one -- guy went out to work, screwed the op and never came back. Conklin couldn't fix it, couldn't find Bourne, couldn't adjust. It all went sideways. Finally there were no

I've given thirty years and two marriages to this agency. I've shoveled shit on four continents. I'm due to retire next year and believe me, I need my pension, but if you think I'm gonna sit here and let you dangle me with this, you can go to hell. Marshall too. It had to be done.

Dead in a ditch? Drunk in a bar in Mogadishu? Who knows?
Dead in a ditch? Drunk in a bar in Mogadishu? Who knows?
I think I do. We had a deal going down in Berlin last week. During the buy, both our Field Agent and the seller were killed. We pulled a fingerprint from a timing charge that didn't go off. They were killed by Jason Bourne.
...Ivan Mevedev -- senior financial manager -- worked for one of the new Russian petroleum companies, Pecos Oil. He claimed to know where the money landed. We believe this could have only happened with help from someone inside the Agency... This...
...this is Conklin's computer.
...this is Conklin's computer.
...At the time of his death, Conklin was sitting on a personal account in the amount of seven-hundred and sixty thousand dollars.

Conklin might've been a nut, but he wasn't a mole. You have me his calendar for a couple of days, I'll prove he killed Lincoln. This is supposed to be definitive?
Conklin might've been a nut, but he wasn't a mole. You have me his calendar for a couple of days, I'll prove he killed Lincoln. This is supposed to be definitive?
What's definitive, is that I just lost two people in Berlin!
What's definitive, is that I just lost two people in Berlin!
So what's your theory? Conklin's reaching out from the grave to protect his good name? The man is dead.
Berlin!
I've already got a team there. I doubt Bourne's in Naples to settle down and raise a family.

You don't know what you're getting into here.
You don't know what you're getting into here.
And you do? From the moment he left Treadstone, he has killed and eluded every person that you sent to find him...
Call a Mayday into Berlin station. We need snipers, DOD, whatever they got. Snipers?
Hold on -- he said he wants to come in.
Hold on -- he said he wants to come in.
My ass he does. You're playing with fire, Pamela. Marshall said nail him to the wall. I don't know how you interpreted that, but I don't think he meant repatriate him.

Don't you want answers?
Don't you want answers?
There are no answers. There's either Jason Bourne alive or Jason Bourne dead. And I for one would prefer the latter. And what about her? You just send her out to this lunatic with no protection?
So what's he doing? You believe him?
It's hard to swallow. The confusion -- the amnesia -- but he keeps on killing? It's more calculated than sick. What about Nicky? She's the last one to see Bourne in Paris. She's the one he asks for. They disappear...

Well, whatever he's doing, I've had enough -- this is now a search and destroy mission. I want the Berlin police fully briefed and -- -- get this out to all the agencies.
Sorry to wake you.
I wasn't sleeping. You OK?
What?
They found Danny Zorn's body. Dead in the basement at the building where my people got hit the first time.

No... It must have been Bourne.

Well, you're probably right. I guess that's all that hubris is.
Sir...
Thanks.
She say what time I should call?
The sooner the better.
I did my box work, but I wanted to show you before I showed Landy. I came out here last night because none of this was making any sense. I mean, I'm with you on this, Conklin was a nut, but a traitor? I just can't get there.
What do you have, Danny?
What do you have, Danny?
You put a four-gam Kel on here and it's gonna take out power to the building. You know that. What you can't know, is if it's gonna blow the room with it.

There were two charges, they were supposed to go off simultaneously. The second one, the one that didn't go off, was down here... First of all, this is nothing, it's a sub-line for the breaker above. Second, why put the charge all the way down here? If you're good enough to get in here and handle the gear, you're good enough to know you

Okay...
Sit. Can you... [The chair. Have the chair.]
I speak English.
Of all the people in the world, you're the only one I have anything to offer. That's why I came here.
Okay.
It's nice. Does this picture mean anything to you? Hmm?
It's nothing. It's just a picture.
It's nothing. It's just a picture.
No. It's because you don't know how they died.
No. It's because you don't know how they died.
No, I do.
I would want to know. I would want to know that my mother didn't kill my father. I would want to know that she didn't kill herself.
What?
It changes things. That knowledge. Doesn't it?
Yes...
Yes...
That's not what happened to your parents.
That's not what happened to your parents.
Then what?
Then what?
I killed them.
It was my job. My first time. Your father was supposed to be alone. But then your mother, she came out of nowhere... I had to change my plan. You understand me? You don't have to live like that anymore. Thinking that.
You killed them.
They loved you. And I killed them.
How... how can... how can you be here and say this?
How... how can... how can you be here and say this?

I should kill you... if it's true you should die... I should kill you now!
I can't let you do that either.
I can't let you do that either.
Because you're afraid!

Sorry. Old habits.
You still should've moved.
I like it here. Last time I saw you was Greece. You had a good spot.
So why didn't you kill me then?
She wouldn't let me. She's the only reason you're alive.
What do you want?
Conklin.
Conklin.
He's dead.
Try again.
Shot dead in Paris. Dead the night you walked out.
You're lying. If it's over, why are they after me?
I don't know.
I don't know.

I don't know who that is.
What's going on in Berlin?
What's going on in Berlin?
I don't know! Why would I lie?
She really did that? Told you not to kill me? I had a woman once. But after a while, what do you talk about? I mean, for us. The work. You can't tell them who you are...
I did.
You called it in?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

I warned them, Marie. I told them to leave us alone.

Jason, please don't do this...it won't ever be over like this.
Jason, please don't do this...it won't ever be over like this.
There's no choice.
I love you, too.
Tell me later.
I wanted to kill him.
But you found another choice.

I did.
I did.
It wouldn't have changed the way you feel.
It wouldn't have changed the way you feel.
It might have.
I know it's a dream.
You do?
You do?
I only dream about people who are dead.
God, I miss you. I don't know what to do without you.
Jason. You know exactly what to do. That is your mission now.
See that tram coming around the corner?
Yes.
Yes.
Get on it.
I did... Jason, I swear, I did... I told them... I told them I believed you...
Who is Pamela Landy?
Who is Pamela Landy?
You hear me? I believed you.
You hear me? I believed you.
IS SHE RUNNING TREADSTONE?
Why is she trying to kill me?
They know! They know you were here. They know you killed these two guys. They know you and Conklin had something on the side. They don't know what it is, but they know!
How do they know that? How can they know any of that?
What is this, a game?
What is this, a game?
I want to hear it from you.
Say it.
Last week an Agency field officer went to make a buy from a Russian national.

It was Pamela Landy's op. The guy was going to sell-out a mole or something. I haven't been debriefed on exactly what it was.

Last week? When?
And you got to him before we could.
I killed him???

You left a print! There was Kel that didn't go off! There was a partial print, they tracked it back to Treadstone! They know it's you!
You left a print! There was Kel that didn't go off! There was a partial print, they tracked it back to Treadstone! They know it's you!
I left a fingerprint! You fucking people.
What was Landy buying? What kind of files? WHAT WAS SHE BUYING?
Conklin! Stuff on Conklin!
Why are you here, then?
Please -- I'm only here because of Paris -- because they can't figure out what you're doing -- I'm here because of Abbott --

For Treadstone. In Berlin. You know my file. I did a job here. When?
For Treadstone. In Berlin. You know my file. I did a job here. When?
No. You never worked Berlin.

My first job.

Your first assignment was Geneva.

That's a lie!

You never worked Berlin...
No... Jason... please...
I was here!
I was here!
...it's not in the file... I swear... I know your file... your first job was Geneva!... I swear to God you never worked here!...
It's me.
Bourne?
What do you want?
I want to come in.
Okay, how do you want to do it?
I want someone I know to take me in.
I want someone I know to take me in.
Who?
Who?
There was a girl in Paris. Part of the program. She used to handle the medication.
Okay, Jason, your move.
Alexanderplatz. 30 minutes. Under the World Clock. Alone. Give her your phone.
Where am I?
Ramstein Air Base, Germany. Before the wall fell you would have woken up in a Russian prison hospital.
Oh, shit...
Careful...
Why am I alive?
Are you disappointed?
Thank you for your gift. I'm sorry about Marie.
What's that?
What's that?
Do you think you can read? Are you well enough?
Don't need it. I remember everything.
Sounds like a threat.
Sounds like a threat.
You didn't answer my question.
You didn't answer my question.
Why you're alive? You're alive because you're special. Because she kept you alive. Because we want you back on our side.
We need to get in there.
I'm working on it.
-- so there were two of these explosive charges placed on the power lines. One of them failed. The fingerprint... That's from the one that didn't go off.
And the Germans can't match it?
Looks like he's been detained.
Who's going? Us?

There's only a Consulate, they sent a field officer out half an hour ago --

Then get a number, they need to know who they're dealing with.
-- Kurt's reopening all the wyfi and sat links --
-- uplink all relevant files to Kim -- -- and I want them to contact anyone who had anything to do with Treadstone --
-- go -- take the van! --
-- the hotel -- how far? --
Maybe he just needed a place to spend the night?
I want to look at the room. Check it out.
Alright... take it down.
What?
What?
This stays between you and I. We finally have an edge. I don't want to lose it.
We'll know for sure when we get the security tapes.
But we can relax. We tracked him. He's on a train to Moscow.
You're sure?
What? The tapes?
What? The tapes?
Hold on... Yep. And Abbott just direct dialed Moscow from his room...
Show me.
Here?
Here?
Now. Show now.
This is everything? Is there.
Is there. Is all there.
-- who? -- who else is here? --
-- no! -- not me! -- no other people! --

I'm here. So is Donnie and Jack Weller. We understand you're using the full allocation for this buy?
That's where we came out.
That's where we came out.
It's a lot of money, Pam.
It's a lot of money, Pam.
We're talking raw, unprocessed KGB files. It's not something we can go out and comparison shop.

Still...

For a thief. A mole. I vetted the source, Marty. He's real. If it does nothing more than narrow the list of suspects, it's a bargain at ten times the price.
Okay, cut to the chase, Pam. What are you selling?
I think that Bourne and Conklin were in business. That Bourne is still involved. And that whatever information I was going to buy in Berlin, it was big enough to make Bourne come out from wherever he's been hiding to kill again. How's that scan?
Mr. Nevins?
Who's this?
Who's this?
Pamela Landy, again. Where do we stand?
How long have you worked for the agency?
Me? Four years.
Me? Four years.
If you ever want to make it to five, you're gonna listen to me real close. Jason Bourne is armed and extremely dangerous. A week ago, he assassinated two men in Berlin, one of whom was a highly-experienced field officer...
I want that area secured, I want any evidence secured and I want it done now. Is that clear??
Yes, sir -- ma'am...
Yes, sir -- ma'am...
I'm getting on a plane to Berlin in 45 minutes, which means you are going to call me back in 30, and when I ask you where we stand, I had better be impressed. My mobile number is...
What kind of problems?
Depression. Anger. Compulsive behaviors. They had physical symptoms -- headaches -- sensitivity to light --
Depression. Anger. Compulsive behaviors. They had physical symptoms -- headaches -- sensitivity to light --
Amnesia?
Amnesia?
Before this? Before Bourne? No.
Good luck.
You were his local contact. You were with him the night Conklin died. You're coming with us.
I'm curious about Bourne. Your interpretation of his condition. You have specific training in the identification and diagnosis of psychological conditions?
Am I a doctor, no, but...

Are you an expert in amnesia?

See, that's a problem for me, Nicky. Whatever he's doing, we need to end it. This isn't the kind of mess you walk away from.
I don't think we need to keep looking for him anyway.
And why is that?
And why is that?
Because he's doing just what he said he'd do. He's coming for us.
Is it fresh?
It's got caffeine in it. That's all I know.
What do you think? Is he coming in?
I don't know. He was sick. He wanted out. I believed him.
I don't know. He was sick. He wanted out. I believed him.
Alright...
Let's give him half an hour.
So?
So?
Felt promising. It's a start.
Do we know what this says?
Yup... The main word there, the file heading, translates as: Treadstone.

What the hell is a "Treadstone?"
Anything?
No. Munich's a bust. He's loose.
No. Munich's a bust. He's loose.
Are we locked up?
Black coat, possibly leather. Dark slacks. Dark t-shirt. He says they're gonna try and corral the guests on the street over there, and then check them out, but...
Yeah, that'll work...What the hell was he doing here?
Here's what I've got. Remember Vladimir Neski? Russian politician? Seven years ago, he was due to speak to a group of European Oil ministers here at the hotel. He never did. He was murdered.
By who?
By who?
His wife. In room 645. Then she shot herself.
His wife. In room 645. Then she shot herself.
Alright... I want you, Kurt and Kim to stay on Bourne, track everything that's out there...
We're looking at all Berlin outbound. Good news is, every train station in Berlin has thirty to forty fixed, digital security cameras. Common feed.
Are we hacking or asking?
Are we hacking or asking?
Yes. In that order.
Yes. In that order.
And what about you, anything?
Someone dead from this household?
We just had a funeral, isn't that what it means in England as well?

Then we'll just have a peek at the wounds. Dig 'em up!
They've been sanctified and buried in the holy rites of God's church, and any hand that disturbs them now takes on eternal damnation. So please -- do it.
We'll sleep here tonight. You'll come home with me. We'll let the house, and the lands too; plenty of willing neighbors.
I don't want to leave.
I don't want to leave.
Didn't want your father to die either, did ya? But it happened.
Did the priest say anything about the Resurrection? Or was it all about Judgment?
It was in Latin, sir.
It was in Latin, sir.
Non loquis Latinum? You don't speak Latin? We have to fix that, won't we? Did he give the poetic benediction? The Lord bless thee and keep thee? Patris Benefactum et -- ...It was Malcolm's favorite.
What are they doing?
Saying goodbye in their own way -- in outlawed tartans, with outlawed pipes, playing outlawed tunes.
But... what will you do?
I will invade England. And defeat the English on their own ground.
I will invade England. And defeat the English on their own ground.
Invade?! That's impossible, it --
A thousand. You have made me Guardian of Scotland. So I tell you this is what we face.
We must sue for peace.

It is suicide.
Sir William. We come to seek a meeting.
You've all sworn to Longshanks.
You've all sworn to Longshanks.
An oath to a liar is no oath at all. An oath to a patriot is a vow indeed. Every man of us is ready to swear loyalty to you.
An oath to a liar is no oath at all. An oath to a patriot is a vow indeed. Every man of us is ready to swear loyalty to you.
So let the council swear publicly.
So let the council swear publicly.
We cannot. Some scarcely believe you are alive. Other think you'll pay them Mornay's wages. We bid you to Edinburgh. Meet us at the city gates, two days from now, at sunset. Pledge us your pardon and we will unite behind you. Scotland will be one.
I will meet you, but only one way -- if Robert the Bruce is there, and puts his hand on my Bible, and swears his loyalty to Scotland.
He has already agreed to come.
Young Robert, we are honored --
My father hears that Longshanks has granted prima noctes.
My father hears that Longshanks has granted prima noctes.
Clearly meant to draw more of his supporters here.
A wise plan. And how is your father? We have missed him at the council.
He strained his leg so that it pains him to ride. But he sends his greetings -- and says that I speak for all the Bruces. And for Scotland.
Does anyone know his politics?
No. But his weight with the commoners could unbalance everything. The Balliols will kiss his ass, so we must.
May he rest in peace... You have already sealed the coffin?
He was a modest man.
He was a modest man.
It will not be long before Longshanks too is encased in stone, and his crowns divided for others to wear.
If I pay homage to another's throne, then how am I a king?
Homage is nothing. It is the crown that matters!
Homage is nothing. It is the crown that matters!
The crown is that of Scotland. And Scotland is William Wallace.
The crown is that of Scotland. And Scotland is William Wallace.
That is another matter. There is a price to all this, required both by Longshanks and our nobles. Pay it, and you will be our king. And we will have peace.
He won't come.
He will. I know he will.
Longshanks promised!
You are surprised he would lie? Balliol was murdered in a church yesterday. You are Longshanks' new designate. You will be king.
Scottish rebels have routed Lord Bottoms!
I hear. This Wallace is a bandit, nothing more.
What news of the north?
Nothing new, Majesty. We have sent riders to speed any word.
Nothing new, Majesty. We have sent riders to speed any word.
While I am in France fighting to expand your future kingdom I learn that Stirling castle is lost, our entire northern army wiped out! And you have done nothing?!
While I am in France fighting to expand your future kingdom I learn that Stirling castle is lost, our entire northern army wiped out! And you have done nothing?!
I have ordered conscriptions...
Wallace has sacked York!
Impossible. How dare you bring a panicky lie.
The weapon has been outlawed by the Pope himself!
So the Scots will have none of them, will they? My armorers have already made a thousand.
Now we kill two birds at one stroke. We recruit from Scotland for our armies in France.
The Scots will fight for us?
The Scots will fight for us?
What choice do they have? Now they must serve us or starve.

He is gone! Finished! Dead! If he has not yet bled to death or had his throat cut for him, he will not survive the winter. It is very cold -- is it not, our flower?
His legend grows! It will be worse than before!
You let Wallace escape your whole army. You cannot blame me for this.
What is it?!
You directed me to report to you the moment the king's conference was ended.

Shut up, would you! How can I concentrate?!
...His majesty was quite keen that you should understand --
...His majesty was quite keen that you should understand --
All so very boring! He wants me to learn to fight too, so let me do it!
No, M'lord.
Look at me. I said LOOK AT ME!
Now, my flower, do you understand?
Yes. I had thought that... I was loathsome to you. Perhaps I am. If I may be excused, M'lord.
Yes. I had thought that... I was loathsome to you. Perhaps I am. If I may be excused, M'lord.
You may.
Good day to you, M'Lords.

Wallace's followers.
Wallace's followers.
Wallace himself. If you wish to pretend a ghost rallies new volunteers in every Scottish town, I leave you to your hauntings. If you wish to take him, I know a way.
The little cow is insane --
Grant, as you do everything else, with treachery. Offer him a truce to discuss terms, and send me to my castle at Locharmbie as your emissary. He trusts me. Pick thirty of your finest assassins for me to take along. And I will set the meeting, and the ambush.
Is it true? Wallace is captured?
Simply because he eluded your trap, do you think he is more than a man? My father is dying. Perhaps you should think of our coronation.
Simply because he eluded your trap, do you think he is more than a man? My father is dying. Perhaps you should think of our coronation.
When will his trial be?
When will his trial be?
Wallace's? For treason there is no trial. Tomorrow he will be charged, then executed.
I have come to beg for the life of William Wallace.
You fancy him.
You fancy him.
I respect him. At worst he was a worthy enemy. Show mercy... Oh thou great king... and win the respect of your own people.
Nor you. To you that word is as unfamiliar as love.
Before he lost his powers of speech, he told me his one comfort was that he would live to know Wallace was dead.
I'll wait... back there.
Hamish, I... thank...
We make spears. A hundred spears. Fourteen feet long.
Fourteen? --
The Bruce is not coming, William.
Mornay has come. So will the Bruce.
Stephen ready?
Aye.
Thanks for the food and drink. And for bringing 'em yourselves.
We're here to stay. We don't care to live, if we can't fight beside ya.
Rest, William.
I rest.
I rest.
Your rest is making me exhausted.
You know it's a trap.
Probably. But we can't win alone. We know that. This is the only way.
Probably. But we can't win alone. We know that. This is the only way.
I don't want to be a martyr.
I don't want to be a martyr.
Nor I! I want to live! I want a home and children and peace. I've asked god for those things. But He's brought me this sword. And if He wills that I must lay it down to have what He wants for my country, then I'll do that too.

Keep these. We're going too.

Call it a test of soldiery, then. The English won't let us train with weapons, so we train with stones.
The test of a soldier is not in his arm. It's here.
I still say this is no test. A catapult can throw a stone farther than a man can.
That depends on the man.
Can you do it when it matters? As it matters in battle? Could you crush a man with that throw?
I could crush you like a roach.
You'll move
I will not.
Good to see you again.
I should'a remembered the eggs.
All right, Father, I'll ask him! If I risk my neck for you, will I get a chance to kill Englishmen?

Shall I leave, M'lord?

No. He did not.

Then why does he stay? My scouts say he has not advanced.

I'll invite you again, but your mother thinks I'm crazy.
You are. And I'll come again.
You've been here before?
Some nights. I have dreams. Mostly dreams I don't want. I started riding at night to fill up my mind so that when I did sleep I'd dream only of the ride and the adventure.

No. You don't choose your dreams. Your dreams choose you.
I want... to marry you!

But I won't give you up to any nobleman.

Shush. It's only been a day. And it's seemed like forever.

Tonight then.

My parents are growing suspicious! I can't keep meeting you every night!
Then when?
...Tonight!
I'm dreaming.
Yes, you are. And you must wake.

I don't want to wake. I want to stay with you.

I need you so much! I love you!

Wake up, William. Wake up!
When the king returns he will bury them in those new clothes. Scotland is in chaos. Your husband is secretly sending an army north.
How do you know this?
How do you know this?
Last night I slept with a member of the War Council.
Last night I slept with a member of the War Council.
He shouldn't be telling secrets in bed.
He shouldn't be telling secrets in bed.
Ah, Oui! Englishmen don't know what a tongue is for.
This Scottish rebel... Wallace? He fights to avenge a woman?
A magistrate wished to capture him, and found he had a secret lover, so he cut the girl's throat to tempt Wallace to fight -- and fight he did.
Knowing his passion for his lost love, they next plotted to take him by desecrating the graves of his father and brother and setting an ambush at the grave of his wife. He fought his way through the trap and carried her body to a secret place! Now that is romance, Oui?
...I wouldn't know.
I am the Princess of Wales.
Wife of Edward, the king's son?
I come as the king's servant, and with his authority.
It's battle I want, not talk.
It's battle I want, not talk.
But now that I am here, will you speak with a woman?
I understand that you have recently been given the rank of knight.
I have been given nothing. God makes men what they are.

Did God make you the sacker of peaceful cities? The executioner of the king's nephew, my husband's own cousin?

York was the staging point for every invasion of my country. And that royal cousin hanged a hundred Scots, even women and children, from the city walls.

That is not possible.
Let us talk plainly. You invade England. But you cannot complete the conquest, so far from your shelter and supply. The King proposes that you withdraw your attack. In return he grants you title, estates, and this chest with a thousand pounds of gold, which I am to pay to you personally.
A Lordship. And gold. That I should become Judas.

Peace is made is such ways.
Peace is made is such ways.
SLAVES ARE MADE IN SUCH WAYS!
I understand you have suffered. I know... about your woman.
She was my wife. We married in secret because I would not share her with an English lord. They killed her to get to me. And she was pregnant.
A meeting in a barn. It had to be a trap. And only you would know I would be aware of it.
It does me good to see you.
Why did you?
Because of the way you're looking at me now. The same way... as when we met.
You have... you have a husband.
I have taken vows. More than one. I've vowed faithfulness to my husband, and sworn to give him a son. And I cannot keep both promises.
You understand. Consider, before you laugh and say no. You will never own a throne, though you deserve one. But just as the sun will rise tomorrow, some man will rule England. And what if his veins ran not with the blood of Longshanks, but with that of a true king?
I cannot love you for the sake of revenge.
I cannot love you for the sake of revenge.
No. But can you love me for the sake of all you loved and lost? Or simply love me... because I love you?
M'lady... what kindness of you to visit a stranger.
Sir, I... come to beg you to confess all, and swear allegiance to the king, that he might show you mercy.
Sir, I... come to beg you to confess all, and swear allegiance to the king, that he might show you mercy.
Will he show mercy to my country? Will he take back his soldiers, and let us rule ourselves?
Will he show mercy to my country? Will he take back his soldiers, and let us rule ourselves?
Mercy... is to die quickly. Perhaps even live in the Tower. In time, who knows what can happen, if you can only live.
Mercy... is to die quickly. Perhaps even live in the Tower. In time, who knows what can happen, if you can only live.
If I swear to him, then everything I am is dead already.
You will die! It will be awful!
Every man dies. Not every man really lives.
Drink this! It will dull your pain.
It will numb my wits, and I must have them all. If I'm senseless, or if I wail, then Longshanks will have broken me.
It will numb my wits, and I must have them all. If I'm senseless, or if I wail, then Longshanks will have broken me.
I can't bear the thought of your torture. Take it!
Wait! ...I respect what you said. But remember, these men have lands, castles. Much to risk.
And the common man who bleeds on the battlefield, does he risk less?
And the common man who bleeds on the battlefield, does he risk less?
No. But from top to bottom this country has no sense of itself. Its nobles share allegiance with England and its clans war with each other. If you make enemies on both sides of the border, you'll end up dead.
No. But from top to bottom this country has no sense of itself. Its nobles share allegiance with England and its clans war with each other. If you make enemies on both sides of the border, you'll end up dead.
We all end up dead. It's only a question of how. And why.
I'm no coward! I want what you want! But we need the nobles.
Nobles? What does that mean -- to be noble? Your title gives you claim to the throne of our country. But men don't follow titles, they follow courage! Your arm speaks louder than your tongue. Our people know you. Noble and common, they respect you. If you would lead them toward freedom, they would follow you. And so would I.
War finds me willing. I know it won't bring back all I have lost. But it can bring what none of us have ever had -- a country of our own. For that we need a king. We need you.
I am trying.
I am trying.
Then tell me what a king is! Is he a man who believes only what others believe? Is he one who calculates the numbers for and against him but never weighs the strength in your own heart? There is strength in you. I see it. I know it.
Then tell me what a king is! Is he a man who believes only what others believe? Is he one who calculates the numbers for and against him but never weighs the strength in your own heart? There is strength in you. I see it. I know it.
I must... consult with my father.

And I will consult with mine.
We can't stop!
They've tricked us.

Exactly.
I thought I was dead when ya pulled that dagger!
No English lord would trust an Irishman!
Fine speech. Now what do we do?
Bring out our spearmen and set them in the field.
Come, it'll help you sleep.
Aye. But it won't let me dream.
Mrs. Treborn! I need to speak with you!
I'm sorry, but can it wait til tonight? I'm already late for work --
I was going to show this to the principal, but I wanted to talk to you first.
What is it?
What is it?
Yesterday I had all the children draw pictures of what they wanted to be when they grew up. Most of them made drawings of what their parents did, but this...
Thank you for showing it to me first. I'll... I'll take care of it. Can I have the picture?
Of course. There is one more thing, Mrs. Treborn. And I feel bad for mentioning it...
Of course. There is one more thing, Mrs. Treborn. And I feel bad for mentioning it...
What?
What?
When I asked Evan about his drawing, well, he didn't remember doing it.
And you say he doesn't remember any of it?
Not according to his teacher. It just got me thinking about Jason and what if Evan's inherited his father's condition?
Not according to his teacher. It just got me thinking about Jason and what if Evan's inherited his father's condition?
Hold it, hold it, Andrea. Let's not jump to conclusions. I'll run some preliminary tests, see what we can rule out.
Just tell me that Evan doesn't have Jason's illness...
Look, Andrea, I'm sure he'll test negative for brain disorders. But there's something else you can try to monitor his memory.
Look, Andrea, I'm sure he'll test negative for brain disorders. But there's something else you can try to monitor his memory.
Anything.
Anything.
A journal. Just have him write down everything he does.
A journal. Just have him write down everything he does.
Why? What for?
Why? What for?
It could be extremely useful to jog his memory. See if he remembers anything new the next day. And I'll have the test results back in a few days.
Well, the good news is that the results are negative. I've found no evidence in the way of lesions, hemorrhaging, tumors...
And the bad news?
And the bad news?
Unfortunately, we've got nothing to work with. It's harder playing detective now.

If I had to guess, I'd say the blackouts are stress related.

But he's seven. What kind of stress can he have?
But he's seven. What kind of stress can he have?
Plenty. Who knows? Maybe he's got severe coping problems about not having a father. Did you say the last blackout occurred when he was with his friend's dad.

Come on, I doubt the answer's that simple.

You'd be surprised how often they are.

Well, he has been pushing me to meet his father, but I've been putting it off.
Well, he has been pushing me to meet his father, but I've been putting it off.
It's worth a shot. I can arrange a controlled meeting. A careful dose of sedatives for Jason, some security, you and I monitoring. Evan comes in for a quick visit and with any luck, no more missing father complex.

How soon?...
Evan wake up, oh please wake up!
Nine, ten. And you're awake! Open your eyes, dammit!
Actually, these tests weren't available twenty years ago.
So what did you find.
No dances, just tell me.
The hemorrhaging... the neural damage is irreparable. I'm frankly surprised he still has use of his motor functions.
We're gonna be late again.
When did you ever care about getting to school on time?
When did you ever care about getting to school on time?
We're putting up pictures for Parent's Night.
Righty-tighty, lefty-lucy.
Thanks. Don't worry Evan, you'll have plenty of time.
Darn it!
Um... can dad come this time?
Um... can dad come this time?
You know the answer to that.
You know the answer to that.
Can't he come out for one day?
Can't he come out for one day?
We've been over this a hundred times. It's too dangerous for him.
We've been over this a hundred times. It's too dangerous for him.
But Lenny said that his dad's coming... and Tommy and Kayleigh's dad...
All the dads are gonna be there.
I get the point, kiddo. But I'm not so bad, am I?
I get the point, kiddo. But I'm not so bad, am I?
No.
No.
Good. Because I've been waiting to see your art projects all week and I'd feel terrible if all you thought about was your father not being there.
I don't like this place, Mom. It's creepy. Please can we go? I promise I won't make any more bad pictures!
You'll be fine. Dr. Redfield just wants to give you some tests. You'll like him.
That's why I wanted you to come here, Evan. Dr. Redfield already has a background in memory loss.
My father has a bad memory, too?
These'll bring you luck, Crockett.
Great. I'll see you soon.
What happened?
Honey. What were you doing with that?
Honey. What were you doing with that?
I... I don't remember.
Now your father may seem sleepy to you, but that's just because of his medicine, okay?
Okay.
I don't know... I don't remember.
Something must've happened! What set him off?
Something must've happened! What set him off?
I... I blacked out.
I... I blacked out.
Don't try to use your blackouts to get out of this one!
Please, mom. People will talk.
I can't help it. I'm just so proud of you. You've got the highest grades in all of your classes.
I can't help it. I'm just so proud of you. You've got the highest grades in all of your classes.
Did Da -- Jason --- get good grades?
Did Da -- Jason --- get good grades?
Please. He got straight A's without ever touching a book. That was the one area where his memory never failed him.
Please. He got straight A's without ever touching a book. That was the one area where his memory never failed him.
Ma? Did he ever say that he figured out a way to recall a lost memory years after he blacked it out for the first time?
Why do you ask?
No, it's just weird with him being such a brain and all, I just wondered if he was ever able to remember stuff he'd forgotten.
No, it's just weird with him being such a brain and all, I just wondered if he was ever able to remember stuff he'd forgotten.
When he was around your age... almost exactly your age. He said he figured out a trick to remember the past.
I couldn't tell if they were real memories or just phantoms. You know, he might only have thought he actually remembered them...
Sure...
Sure...
And then, just before it got so bad that he had to be committed, he said that he could...
And then, just before it got so bad that he had to be committed, he said that he could...
What? What could he do?
...I spoke to your new lawyer about the appeal. He's sure he can get you off on self-defense, so if you're patient.
How long will I be in here?
How long will I be in here?
I don't know. These things take time.
I don't know. These things take time.
How's Kayleigh doing? She all right?
I found these. The others are still in storage.
Damn it, Mom. I told you I need them all!
Damn it, Mom. I told you I need them all!
Fine. You'll get them, Evan. But I think it's far more important to focus on your case right now.
Okay, doc. What's the damage? How much time have I got?
Cute, Evan.
What does that mean for Evan?
He's saying it's like forty years worth of new memories have been jammed in my brain since last year. Overload city. 'Sat about the gist of it, doc?
There must be a way to fix this.
Fix?
Fix?
I just need the entry about the blockbuster. Wait, shit, no arms. I never even got the chance to write it.
You're. Acting. Like your father.
Come on, Mom. Just 'cause Dad was my age when he started going crazy doesn't mean that I'm nuts.
How. Did you. Know that?
You told me that on Parents' Weekend. Remember? Wait, that wasn't me. Or you.
Just. Like. Jason.
Don't worry. I'm gonna get you out of here.
Best not bitch up. Wind up someone's luggage that way.
Can you protect me?
Can you protect me?
Jesus himself couldn't make me take on the Brotherhood. When they come, just put your mind in another place, man. Be somewhere else.
You're religious Carlos, you believe that bit about "the Lord works in mysterious ways?"
Straight up.
Straight up.
Because I think he sent me to your cell on purpose. For you to help me.
Because I think he sent me to your cell on purpose. For you to help me.
Shit. I knew you were crazy.
Shit. I knew you were crazy.
I ain't bullshitting. Jesus speaks to me in my dreams.
So when I'm out, I need you to watch my face and hands closely.
You need to see the prison shrink, man.
Just tell me if anything weird happens.
Weirder than this?
Weirder than this?
Marks, scars, I dunno. Anything could happen I guess.
What did you see? What did it look like?
Signs of the Lord. They just appeared out of nowhere. I thought you were loco!
Signs of the Lord. They just appeared out of nowhere. I thought you were loco!
So you believe me?
Hello, Evan. It's very nice to meet you. He's as handsome as his father.
You know my father?
Dad lives here?
Not in this wing, actually. No.
Now I want you to go back to the time you were in the woods with Lenny. Think of it like a movie. You can pause, rewind, or slow down any details you wish. Understand?
Yes.
Yes.
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
I'm standing next to Kayleigh, my hands are over her ears.
I'm standing next to Kayleigh, my hands are over her ears.
Are you hurting her?
Are you hurting her?
No, protecting her.
Okay. Then go a little forward in time. What do you see now?
I see a car.
Go on. Nothing can hurt you. Remember, this is only a movie. You're completely safe.
I can't... the car vanishes and all of a sudden I'm on the ground in the woods.
I can't... the car vanishes and all of a sudden I'm on the ground in the woods.
The car doesn't vanish Evan. The movie in your head has broken, that's all. But now I've re-spliced it and I want you to tell me about the car.
The car doesn't vanish Evan. The movie in your head has broken, that's all. But now I've re-spliced it and I want you to tell me about the car.
It's coming... argh! I can't!
It's a little complicated. I haven't seen results exactly like these before.
Are you sure? Not even with my father?
This is where we're finding most of the hemorrhaging. The outer lining of the cerebral cortex.
Lemme guess. Would that be where the memories are stored?
Hey, Evan. What's the big rush? We don't meet for another hour.
Where are my goddamn books?
Where are my goddamn books?
Books?
Books?
My journals! Where are they?
Think Evan. You've invented a disease that doesn't exist. Alternate universes with colleges, prisons, paraplegia...
But I... I need those books.
But I... I need those books.
You remind me of your father. He always screamed for a photo album even though he never had one.
You remind me of your father. He always screamed for a photo album even though he never had one.
Photos?
Get dressed, Thumper, you're taking me out for my birthday.
I thought you were a December baby.
I thought you were a December baby.
This is bigger. Seven years to the day. No blackouts.
It's an experiment with flatworms and a maze. You take a flatworm and run it through the maze until he's memorized it. Then you put a new flatworm in the maze. He's clueless. Banging into walls, getting lost, whatever.
Like Ozzy.
Just by absorbing the first worm into its cellular structure, it gets all of the worm's memories.
That's probably why Hannibal Lecter's so smart.
You really think he wanted to kill you?
All I know is that I might be able to unblock some of my repressed memories.
I never wanted to be in the movie anyway and it was cold so I wanted to wear my clothes but Mr. Miller took his shirt off --
What the fuck are you doing?
What the fuck are you doing?
Shhh! I need quiet for this.
Are you stupid or what?
What?
What?
Shucks, I dunno. But maybe there's a reason why you've repressed the one day when some old lecher had you in your tighty whities, dammit!
Whasamatter? Lost your Rolex?
Huh?
Huh?
Fuck off, frat boy.
Get out. Both of you.
Sorry, dude. Just figured it'd be okay with you bein' sick and all.
We should go soon. If Dad catches us smoking down here, we're dead.
So let's go. This place creeps me out.
Oh God... what did we do?
Shit, Lenny. What's happened to you! We've gotta get help!
I'm sorry Kayleigh. This was a bad idea.
You really don't remember anything that happened?
Ouch.
I'm sorry.
It's not your fault. Mrs. Kagan called dad and blamed us for what happened to Lenny.
Damn. Your dad did this?
I deserve a lot worse.
What are you talking about? What you deserve is a better brother and father. All they do is make you feel like shit.
I can't believe Tommy's still pissed at me. He knows I'm moving away, right?
He's been acting real strange lately. He won't even look me in the eyes anymore.
He's been acting real strange lately. He won't even look me in the eyes anymore.
Duck, here they come.
Did your mom say if Lenny was... okay?
He must be. They're letting him go, right?
Welcome home. Thought you might like some fresh air for a change.
Hi, Lenny.
God, Evan! I never thought I'd see you again. How've you been?
Oh, comme si, comme ca, you know...
Oh, comme si, comme ca, you know...
No, Evan. I don't know. It's been a long time. Fill me in.
No, Evan. I don't know. It's been a long time. Fill me in.
I'm going to State now. Things are going okay. I guess. Mom's good...
Not since we were kids.
I've stopped a hundred times.
I've stopped a hundred times.
So how's Tommy?
So how's Tommy?
They kept him in juvy for a few years. Now he works over at Dale's Autobody.
No. I emancipated myself when I was fifteen.
Wow. That must've taken some courage.
Wow. That must've taken some courage.
Not if you remember my dad.
Not if you remember my dad.
Couldn't you have moved in with your mom?
Couldn't you have moved in with your mom?
She had a new family. Not enough space for me. Said I should have moved in with her when we were kids. But... whatever.
Actually, Kayleigh, the reason I came back to town was to talk to you.
Me? Are you kidding? Why?
Me? Are you kidding? Why?
Remember when I was a kid I had all these blackouts?
Remember when I was a kid I had all these blackouts?
Of course.
Of course.
Well, lately some of the memories have begun to come back and I'd kinda like to talk to you about one of them in particular. It'd be a big help.
Well, lately some of the memories have begun to come back and I'd kinda like to talk to you about one of them in particular. It'd be a big help.
Well, sure. I'll try to remember. Shoot.
Well, sure. I'll try to remember. Shoot.
When we were kids. Your dad was making a movie. Robin Hood or something?
When we were kids. Your dad was making a movie. Robin Hood or something?
What do you want to know, Evan?
What do you want to know, Evan?
It's just... did he... what happened in the basement?
It's just... did he... what happened in the basement?
It was a long time ago.
It was a long time ago.
I know, but...
I know, but...
Is that why you came all the way back? To ask a lot of stupid questions about Robin Hood?
Is that why you came all the way back? To ask a lot of stupid questions about Robin Hood?
No, but I think something really bad might've happened to us.
Just shut up, Evan. You're wasting your breath.
You can't hate yourself just because your dad's a twisted freak.
You can't hate yourself just because your dad's a twisted freak.
Who are you trying to convince, Evan?! You come all the way out here to stir up my shit just because you had a bad memory!? You want me to cry on your shoulder and tell you that everything's all better now? Well fuck you, Evan! Nothing's gonna be all better! Okay?! Nothing ever gets better!
Jesus, Kayleigh, you're... Incredible.
Mmmm... You give good compliment. Clean up and come back to bed.
Where... where are my clothes?
Those are your clothes, silly.
Hey, uh, don't go freaking out on me over this, but do you remember when your dad first got his video camera?
Well I remember he had one... but he, like, put it away after the first day. Why would that freak me out?
Well I remember he had one... but he, like, put it away after the first day. Why would that freak me out?
I dunno. Just being weird.
Oh my God, that was good. Where'd you learn all those new tricks?
So it didn't feel... weird?
So it didn't feel... weird?
Yeah, if you call multiple orgasms weird.
What do you think it is about us that makes us so perfect? Like, looking back, whatever gave you the nerve to sneak out and visit me after I moved away?
As if my dad could've stopped me from seeing you. What's he gonna do to me?
I don't understand, where are you taking me?
You'll see.
I don't know what to say. It's beautiful.
Go on. Sit down.
Why are you doing all this for me?
Simple math. When I woke up this morning and saw your smile... I knew that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you.
It's my fault. I should have told you he was released a few weeks ago.
Might'a been nice. Like this is gonna do any good. Maybe one of the frat guys has a gun.
Might'a been nice. Like this is gonna do any good. Maybe one of the frat guys has a gun.
Please, Evan. Don't even joke. He wouldn't hurt you. He's just trying to scare you away from me.
Please, Evan. Don't even joke. He wouldn't hurt you. He's just trying to scare you away from me.
Yeah, right. Tell that to Crockett.
Yeah, right. Tell that to Crockett.
It's not his fault, Evan. You knew how bad he had it when we were kids.
It's not his fault, Evan. You knew how bad he had it when we were kids.
Don't give me this Oprah-book club bad upbringing shit, because you turned out fine.
Don't give me this Oprah-book club bad upbringing shit, because you turned out fine.
My father never laid a hand on me. It's like the prick saved it all up for Tommy.
Are you okay?
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
It's just... you've been acting kinda strange, you know?
It's just... you've been acting kinda strange, you know?
Like how?
Like how?
I don't know. You seem... different. You make weird jokes. Your accents changed. You don't even walk the same.
I don't know. You seem... different. You make weird jokes. Your accents changed. You don't even walk the same.

I can't put my finger on it, but everything's a bit off. Even the dinner tonight. It was beautiful, but...
I can't put my finger on it, but everything's a bit off. Even the dinner tonight. It was beautiful, but...
I know I've been actin strange lately. It's just that... I don't want anything to happen to us.
Wait. Something's not right. Isn't that your jacket?
What?
Evan, stop! You're gonna kill him!
He's a fucking maniac!
I want you to take this, Lenny. Today's your day of atonement. I know how guilty you feel about that woman and her baby --
Evan. Stop it. It's not the time.
Evan. Stop it. It's not the time.
Now's the only time! Today you get a chance to redeem yourself. Start over with a clean slate. Tabula rasa --
Oh, I thought you were my eight o'clock. Make it fast, I'm expecting someone.
Nice to see you, too. Can I come in?
So how's tricks? Sorry, occupational humor.
I get it. You can drop it now.
I get it. You can drop it now.
Oh, I'm sorry. Does my line of work make you uncomfortable, precious?
Oh, I'm sorry. Does my line of work make you uncomfortable, precious?
No. Just that you need to hurt me with it. I've been where you've been.
No. Just that you need to hurt me with it. I've been where you've been.
Ha! Where's that?
Ha! Where's that?
The bottom. When you're just a piece of meat waiting for the next attack.
What's happened to you?
You wouldn't believe me. I mean, people always say, "You wouldn't believe me", but in this case, it's not even worth trying.

I've seen some sickening shit. I don't blink twice anymore, especially in your case.

Why's that?
Why's that?
Because you're... different.

Different? How?
Different? How?
Let me ask you a question. Just a little one that's been gnawing at me for years.

Yeah?
Yeah?
On the bridge. How did you know that Tommy had your dog? That was no fucking hunch.
On the bridge. How did you know that Tommy had your dog? That was no fucking hunch.
Do you remember when I was a kid and I had those blackouts?
You're right, Evan, I don't believe you.
I never thought you would. That's why I've never bothered to tell a soul until now, and why I never will again.
I never thought you would. That's why I've never bothered to tell a soul until now, and why I never will again.
I'm the only person you've told? That's a great line. Does that make other girls swoon? Do they actually eat up this bullshit?

I couldn't give a shit if you believe me or not, and frankly I'm too tired to prove it to you.

Shit. I dunno. How would I know about the twin moles on your inner thigh?

Anyone with fifty bucks could tell you that.
Anyone with fifty bucks could tell you that.
Then forget that. How about... you prefer the smell of a skunk to flowers, you hate cilantro because for reasons unknown to you, it reminds you of your step-sister.
I just thought you should know.
Know what?
Know what?
That I didn't leave you there to rot.
There's one major hole in your story.
Which is?
Which is?
There is no fuckin' way on this planet or any other that I was in some fuckin' sorority.
Sure you don't want your wallet?
Don't think I'll need it where I'm going.
Don't think I'll need it where I'm going.
Off to change everyone's life again, is that it? Maybe this time you'll pop up in some mansion while I wind up in Tijuana doing the donkey act.

Well, don't give up now, Slick. You've already done so much for me. Hell, why don't you go back in time and save Mrs. Halpern and her baby. Then maybe Lenny wouldn't freak out and ruin my family.
Where are we going?
We have to get you to Sunnyvale. You're having one of your famous hemorrhages.
We have to get you to Sunnyvale. You're having one of your famous hemorrhages.
Stop! Take me back!
You know how spiritual he's gotten ever since he saved Mrs. Halpern and Katie.
He saved Mrs. Halpern? Please, the twisted fuck.
Is something the matter?
Yeah, I think I gotta get these fixed or something.
Kayleigh? Do you ever think about "us?" I mean, wonder if it could ever have been different between the two of us?
Sure, Evan, why not? You were the first person I really ever cared about.
Sure, Evan, why not? You were the first person I really ever cared about.
I was?
I was?
That's why when I was little I never went to live with my mother.

I don't get it.
I don't get it.
When my folks split, they gave me and Tommy a choice who we wanted to live with. I couldn't stand my dad, but I knew if I moved to my mom's I'd never see you again.

I never knew that. So then you still sometimes think of us... together?

It's crossed my mind from time to time.
It's crossed my mind from time to time.
And...?
And...?
Well a lot of things cross my mind. I've always been a fast thinker, Ev. I can play out the movie of our entire lives in under a second.

Then you think it might have worked out?
Then you think it might have worked out?
Why not? But that's not how things wound up. I'm with Lenny, Lenny's your friend. And there it ends.
We're really gonna be in a movie!?
That's right, Evan, and you get to be the star.
Where am I? What happened? Where did we all go?
Calm down, kid. Stand still.
I was just somewhere else -- how did I get here?
Quit acting like some retard or I'll call your mother and tell her what a naughty little shit you've been.
Quit acting like some retard or I'll call your mother and tell her what a naughty little shit you've been.
Kayleigh? What happened?
What time is it?
It's time for you to stand where the hell I told you.
It's time for you to stand where the hell I told you.
Wrong answer, fuckbag. This is the very moment of your reckoning. In the next thirty seconds you're going to open one of two doors. The first door will forever traumatize your own flesh and blood.
What's happened to -- How are you doing that?
It'll change your daughter from a beautiful child into an empty shell whose only concept of trust was betrayed by her own sick pedophile father. Ultimately, it'll lead to her suicide. Nice work, daddy.

Who -- who are you?
Let's just say you're being closely watched, George. Your other option is to get your porn off the rack and treat Kayleigh like... oh, let's say like how a loving father treats his daughter. Sound okay to you, Papa?
...yes.
...yes.
Listen close then, fuckbag. You screw up again and I swear I'll flat out castrate you.
Easy does it, Evan! Don't be a bad boy or I'll tell mommy you were naughty.
And I'll tell the Child Protective Services about your kiddie porn endeavors. One step closer and I'll shove this up your ass!
That's dangerous! You could blow your hands off!
Been there, done that.
It's okay. I won't bite. You've seen pictures of me, right?
Uh-huh. Mom says I have your eyes and your --
Are you okay? You looked like you were somewhere else for a second there.
Look, Jason, I need some fast answers if I'm ever gonna fix what I've done.
I was praying this curse would have ended with me.
But it didn't. And now I need info to make things right again and you're the only one who can give it to me.
But it didn't. And now I need info to make things right again and you're the only one who can give it to me.
There is no "right". When you change who people are, you destroy who they were.
There is no "right". When you change who people are, you destroy who they were.
Who's to say you can't make things better?
You can't play God, son. It must end with me. Just by being here, you may be killing your mother.
Bullshit. I'll send you a postcard when I've made everything perfect again.
Evan, you're hysterical. You study for this?
We'll find out soon enough.
We'll find out soon enough.
Me neither.
You're kidding. Are these the answers?!
Damn, Evan, on the D.L.
Damn, Evan, on the D.L.
Thanks. Wow. Hey, I want to do something really special for Kayleigh tomorrow. If I said I needed some help from you and the brothers...
Thanks. Wow. Hey, I want to do something really special for Kayleigh tomorrow. If I said I needed some help from you and the brothers...
I'd say blow me. Get the pledges to do it.
I'm not sure. I might have gotten some stories mixed up. Did Pavlov condition his dogs to lick his nuts?
Typical psych major. A complete wise ass. And how's your project coming? Still planning to change the way we humble scientists view memory assimilation?
Typical psych major. A complete wise ass. And how's your project coming? Still planning to change the way we humble scientists view memory assimilation?
Hey, I got no choice.
Whoa! Didn't mean to scare you, Evan. Just wanted to know how the flatworms project was coming.
Oh, fine I guess. It's been kind of crazy lately with my mom coming up, so I haven't...
Oh, fine I guess. It's been kind of crazy lately with my mom coming up, so I haven't...
I know, I know. Who can think of worms when your libido's in full swing, right?
Just don't drop the ball, okay?
I won't let you down, Professor Carter.
Remember, everyone! Only two weeks until your science projects are due.
I still owe you an essay from last week. Is there any way I could get an extension?
I still owe you an essay from last week. Is there any way I could get an extension?
And you are...?
And you are...?
Evan Treborn.
Evan Treborn.
The answer's 'no', Mr. Treborn. Now take a seat. The exam's about to begin.
So what's the point?
Maybe if I can figure out how the memories of a simple worm function, it'll help me understand the complexities of the human brain.
Smells like sex in here.
Thumper had a busy afternoon.
Thumper had a busy afternoon.
You're kidding. He's so... big.
Most guys tuck their porn under here, but all you have are... comp books.
Yeah. I've been keeping journals since I was seven.
Yeah. I've been keeping journals since I was seven.
Wow... read something.
Freeze! No "worm-boy". No "Mr. Worm," and no "Worm-Master-General!" Once you get a nickname like that you can't shake it. And I don't want everyone thinking I've got tapeworms coming out of my ass or something, okay?
Deal. Now read me something.
Come on, go on...
It was like Tommy was possessed or something. There was a hate in his eyes that I couldn't really call human.
It didn't feel like a dream.
Maybe because they never do. So Don Juan, you pass out on all your dates?
Can... can... Can I have this?
Sure. I was gonna make a new one, anyway.
That should buy you ten minutes at least.
Gee, thanks friend.
I couldn't cut the rope.
Yeah, good, what else do you remember?
Yeah, good, what else do you remember?
Drop it or I'll slit your mother's throat in her sleep.
You knew the whole time, didn't you? When you put the blade in my hand, you knew something big was going to happen. Didn't you?!
Y... yes. I guess I did.
Uh, we should be getting to class now.
Forget it. What's the point of Psych now? Tomorrow I could wake up as some dirt farmer in Bangladesh.
Are you sure you even packed it?
My mom packed for me. I think she sent everything I ever owned. So we'll see.
What do you need it for? I don't get you lately.
Duly noted. Now I'm gonna ask you for one last favor.
Duly noted. Now I'm gonna ask you for one last favor.
What?
What?
Shhh. I need to concentrate on the blockbuster if I'm gonna destroy it.
Shhh. I need to concentrate on the blockbuster if I'm gonna destroy it.
Destroy it?
Destroy it?
If I hadn't blown my arms off, Mom never woulda started smoking in the first place. Now shhhh.
Hey, what'd you do that for?
Fat little baby, crying for mommy.
Tommy, I'm bored shitless over here. What's up already?
Hold your horses, man. It's here somewhere. I saw it when I was a kid.
Hurry! Let's go! Get him up, Evan! Come on!
What happened?? Where are we?!
Look what you made me do!
What's wrong with you?!
Leave us alone you sick fuck!
Get this "us" shit. As if I was gonna lay a hand on my own sister. You've done nicely for yourself, Evan. Nice friends, nice life, not to mention you're fucking my sister. Not a bad piece of ass if I say so myself.
What the hell are you doing?
It wasn't enough that the whole world loves you, but you had to take away the last person on earth who didn't think I was a piece of shit.
It wasn't enough that the whole world loves you, but you had to take away the last person on earth who didn't think I was a piece of shit.
No one thinks you're a piece of shit, Tommy.
No one thinks you're a piece of shit, Tommy.
Right, Evan. I believe you just said "sick fuck."
Listen to me good, Evan...
I'll do whatever you want. You don't want me to ever see Kayleigh again, fine. Just let Crockett go. Besides, you kill him now and they'll stick you in juvy for sure. And I know you'd never leave your sister alone with your father.
I did what you said, man! We're pooling our student funds with Hillel House and we're going to have an Awareness Dance.
Oh goody, nothing like spinning my chair around to a techno mix of Hava Nagila til I puke.
Lung cancer?
Sorry, Mrs. T. He's been out of sorts lately.
Mom. Don't cry. I can change this.
I think I'll go check out the chapel.
Just get out, didja?
Huh?
Huh?
Nothing. Just that my brother did a stint in the pen and he used to eat like that.

Meant no offense.

None taken. Hey, uh, does Kayleigh Miller still work here?

Sorry. Never heard of her.
Evan, guess what? Dad got a new video camera and we're all gonna be in a movie.
I don't think Evan gets to be in it --
I don't think Evan gets to be in it --
Quit it, Tommy. Evan gets to be Robin Hood. I'm gonna be Maid Marian, and you're the Sheriff of Nottingham!
Quit it, Tommy. Evan gets to be Robin Hood. I'm gonna be Maid Marian, and you're the Sheriff of Nottingham!
I thought I was the bad guy!
I thought I was the bad guy!
You are, silly. He's a bad sheriff.
What did I say about mentioning that bitch?
Where the hell are you taking us anyway? Just blow something up already.
Where the hell are you taking us anyway? Just blow something up already.
Just blow something up? Are you nuts? There's an art to mass destruction. Would you just paint the Mona Lisa? No. Besides, we're here already.
Wipe that sad-assed look off your face before you get us all busted. You see the way Evan's mom was looking at you?
I'm sorry.
Lenny? Come on!
Oh my God oh my God...
Shut up, Tommy!
Aw, hey now, that was a compliment.
You put the mommy too far away. Mrs. Boswell has macaroni and glue if you wanna fix it.
You're such a retard!
Here you go, buddy.
What? No frigging way, man. I'm not touching that thing.
What? No frigging way, man. I'm not touching that thing.
The hell you aren't. Anyone of us does it, you'll puss out and narc for sure.
The hell you aren't. Anyone of us does it, you'll puss out and narc for sure.
Ain't gonna work this time, buddy. Look how small that fuse is! I'll get killed.
Maybe it went out. Should someone check it?
Yeah, you do that, Lenny.
Monsieur Rick?
Yes?
Yes?
Could I speak to you for just a moment, please?
How did you get in here? You're under age.
I came with Captain Renault.
I came with Captain Renault.
I should have known.
I should have known.
My husband is with me, too.
My husband is with me, too.
He is? Well, Captain Renault's getting broadminded. Sit down. Will you have a drink?
No, of course not. Do you mind if I do?
No.
Monsieur Rick, what kind of man is Captain Renault?
Oh, he's just like any other man, only more so.
Oh, he's just like any other man, only more so.
No, I mean, is he trustworthy? Is his word --
No, I mean, is he trustworthy? Is his word --
-- Now, just a minute. Who told you to ask me that?
-- Now, just a minute. Who told you to ask me that?
He did. Captain Renault did.
He did. Captain Renault did.
I thought so. Where's your husband?
I thought so. Where's your husband?
At the roulette table, trying to win enough for our exit visa. Well of course, he's losing.
How long have you been married?
Eight weeks. We come from Bulgaria. Oh, things are very bad there, Monsieur. A devil has the people by the throat. So, Jan and I, we, we do not want our children to grow up in such a country.

So you decided to go to America.
So you decided to go to America.
Yes, but we have not much money, and traveling is so expensive and difficult. It was much more than we thought to get here. And then Captain Renault sees us and he is so kind. He wants to help us.
Yes, but we have not much money, and traveling is so expensive and difficult. It was much more than we thought to get here. And then Captain Renault sees us and he is so kind. He wants to help us.
Yes, I'll bet.

He tells me he can give us an exit visa, but we have no money.

Does he know that?

Oh, yes.
Oh, yes.
And he is still willing to give you a visa?

Yes, Monsieur.
Yes, Monsieur.
And you want to know --
And you want to know --
-- Will he keep his word?
-- Will he keep his word?
He always has.
Nobody ever loved me that much.
And he never knew, and the girl kept this bad thing locked in her heart? That would be all right, wouldn't it?

You want my advice?
You want my advice?
Oh, yes, please.
Oh, yes, please.
Go back to Bulgaria.
Go back to Bulgaria.
Oh, but if you knew what it means to us to leave Europe, to get to America! Oh, but if Jan should find out! He is such a boy. In many ways I am so much older than he is.
Oh, but if you knew what it means to us to leave Europe, to get to America! Oh, but if Jan should find out! He is such a boy. In many ways I am so much older than he is.
Yes, well, everybody in Casablanca has problems. Yours may work out. You'll excuse me.
Monsieur Rick, I --
-- He's just a lucky guy.
Excuse me, but you look like a couple who are on their way to America.
Well?
You will find a market there for this ring. I am forced to sell it at a great sacrifice.
Thank you, but I hardly think --
Thank you, but I hardly think --
-- Then perhaps for the lady. The ring is quite unique.
Good.
What is your name?
What is your name?
Berger, Norwegian, and at your service, sir.
Such a bargain. But that is your decision?
I'm sorry. It is.
Mr. Berger, the ring, could I see it again?
Yes, Monsieur.
Yes, Monsieur.
A champagne cocktail, please.
I recognize you from the news photographs, Monsieur Laszlo.
In a concentration camp, one is apt to lose a little weight.

We read five times that you were killed in five different places.
We read five times that you were killed in five different places.
As you see, it was true every single time. Thank heaven I found you, Berger. I am looking for a man by the name of Ugarte. He is supposed to help me.
I see.
But we who are still free will do all we can. We are organized, Monsieur, underground like everywhere else. Tomorrow night there is a meeting at the Caverne du Bois. If you would come...
Monsieur Rick, may I get you a cup of coffee?
No thanks, Carl.
No thanks, Carl.
Monsieur Rick!
Well, you are in pretty good shape, Herr Rick.
How long can I afford to stay closed?
How long can I afford to stay closed?
Oh, two weeks, maybe three.

Maybe I won't have to. A bribe has worked before. In the meantime, everybody stays on salary.
Maybe I won't have to. A bribe has worked before. In the meantime, everybody stays on salary.
Oh, thank you, Herr Rick. Sacha will be happy to hear it. I owe him money.
Now you finish locking up, will you, Carl?

I won't.

Goodnight.

The police break up our meeting. Herr Rick! We escaped in the last moment.
Come up here a minute.
Yes, I come.
I want you to turn out the light in the rear entrance. It might attract the police.

Yes, I come, I will do it.
I want you to take Miss Lund home.
Yes, sir.
Excuse me, Monsieur Rick, but a gentleman inside has won twenty thousand francs. The cashier would like some money.
Well, I'll get it from the safe.
Well, I'll get it from the safe.
I am so upset, Monsieur Rick. You know I can't understand --
I am so upset, Monsieur Rick. You know I can't understand --

I'm awfully sorry.
Here you are.
It shall not happen again, Monsieur.

That's all right.
Here's to you, sir.
Er, good luck, yes.

I'd better be going.

Er, my check, please.

I have to warn you, sir. I beseech you...

It has been a pleasure to meet you.
Hello, Rick.
Hello, Ferrari. How's business at the Blue Parrot?

Fine, but I would like to buy your cafe.

I don't buy or sell human beings.

That's too bad. That's Casablanca's leading commodity. In refugees alone we could make a fortune if you would work with me through the black market.

My dear Rick, when will you realize that in this world today isolationism is no longer a practical policy?
I see the bus is in. I'll take my shipment with me.
No hurry. I'll have it sent over. Have a drink with me.
No hurry. I'll have it sent over. Have a drink with me.
I never drink in the morning. And every time you send my shipment over, it's always just a little bit short.
I never drink in the morning. And every time you send my shipment over, it's always just a little bit short.
Carrying charges, my boy, carrying charges. Here, sit down. There's something I want to talk over with you, anyhow.
The bourbon. The news about Ugarte upset me very much.
You're a fat hypocrite. You don't feel any sorrier for Ugarte than I do.
Of course not. What upsets me is the fact that Ugarte is dead and no one knows where those letters of transit are.
Practically no one.
Practically no one.
If I could lay my hands on those letters, I could make a fortune.

So could I. And I'm a poor businessman.

I have a proposition for whoever has those letters. I will handle the entire transaction, get rid of the letters, take all the risk, for a small percentage.

And the carrying charges?

Naturally there will be a few incidental expenses. That is the proposition I have for whoever has those letters.

I'll tell him when he comes in.
I'll tell him when he comes in.
Rick, I'll put my cards on the table. I think you know where those letters are.
Rick, I'll put my cards on the table. I think you know where those letters are.
Well, you're in good company. Renault and Strasser probably think so, too.
That's why I came over here to give them a chance to ransack my place.
Rick, don't be a fool. Take me into your confidence. You need a partner.
Shall we draw up the papers, or is our handshake good enough?
It's certainly not good enough. But since I'm in a hurry, it'll have to do.
Ah, to get out of Casablanca and go to America! You're a lucky man.
Oh, by the way, my agreement with Sam's always been that he gets twenty- five percent of the profits. That still goes.
Oh, by the way, my agreement with Sam's always been that he gets twenty- five percent of the profits. That still goes.
Hmmm. I happen to know that he gets ten percent. But he's worth twenty- five.

And Abdul and Carl and Sacha, they stay with the place, or I don't sell.

Of course they stay. Rick's wouldn't be Rick's without them.
Of course they stay. Rick's wouldn't be Rick's without them.
Well, so long.
Don't forget, you owe Rick's a hundred cartons of American cigarettes.
I shall remember to pay it... to myself.
You see, my dear, the word has gone around.
As leader of all illegal activities in Casablanca, I am an influential and respected man. It would not be worth my life to do anything for Monsieur Laszlo. You, however, are a different matter.
As leader of all illegal activities in Casablanca, I am an influential and respected man. It would not be worth my life to do anything for Monsieur Laszlo. You, however, are a different matter.
Signor Ferrari thinks it might just be possible to get an exit visa for you.
I will stay here and keep on trying. I'm sure in a little while --
-- We might as well be frank, Monsieur. It will take a miracle to get you out of Casablanca. And the Germans have outlawed miracles.
We've decided, Signor Ferrari. For the present we'll go on looking for two exit visas. Thank you very much.
Well, good luck. But be careful. You know you're being shadowed?
I observe that you in one respect are a very fortunate man, Monsieur. I am moved to make one more suggestion, why, I do not know, because it cannot possibly profit me, but, have you heard about Signor Ugarte and the letters of transit?
Yes, something.
Yes, something.
Those letters were not found on Ugarte when they arrested him.
Do you know where they are?
Not for sure, Monsieur, but I will venture to guess that Ugarte left those letters with Monsieur Rick.
Rick?
He is a difficult customer, that Rick. One never knows what he'll do or why. But it is worth a chance.

Thank you very much. Good day.
It was gracious of you to share it with me. Good day, Mademoiselle, Monsieur.
Good day.
And Mademoiselle?
You needn't be concerned about me.
Mademoiselle, after this disturbance it is not safe for Laszlo to stay in Casablanca.
This morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave Casablanca.

That is also true, except for one destination, to return to occupied France.

Uh huh. Under a safe conduct from me.

What value is that? You may recall what German guarantees have been worth in the past.

There are only two other alternatives for him.

It is possible the French authorities will find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here.

My dear Mademoiselle, perhaps you have already observed that in Casablanca, human life is cheap. Good night, Mademoiselle.
-- It was "La Belle Aurore."
How nice. You remembered. But of course, that was the day the Germans marched into Paris.

Not an easy day to forget.

No.
No.
I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.
I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.
Yes. I put that dress away. When the Germans march out, I'll wear it again.
Say goodnight to Sam for me.
I will.
I will.
There's still nobody in the world who can play "As Time Goes By" like Sam.

He hasn't played it in a long time.
Who are you really? And what were you before? What did you do and what did you think? Huh?
We said "no questions."
We said "no questions."
Here's looking at you, kid.
A franc for your thoughts.
In America they'd bring only a penny. I guess that's about all they're worth.

I'm willing to be overcharged. Tell me.

And I was wondering.

Yes?
Yes?
Why I'm so lucky. Why I should find you waiting for me to come along.

I'm sorry for asking. I forgot we said "no questions."
I'm sorry for asking. I forgot we said "no questions."
Well, only one answer can take care of all our questions.
Richard, they'll find out your record. It won't be safe for you here.
I'm on their blacklist already, their roll of honor.
My German's a little rusty.
It's the Gestapo. They say they expect to be in Paris tomorrow.
With the whole world crumbling, we pick this time to fall in love.
Yeah. It's pretty bad timing. Where were you, say, ten years ago?
Yeah. It's pretty bad timing. Where were you, say, ten years ago?
Ten years ago? Let's see... ...Yes. I was having a brace put on my teeth. Where were you?
Ten years ago? Let's see... ...Yes. I was having a brace put on my teeth. Where were you?
Looking for a job.
Was that cannon fire, or is it my heart pounding?
Ah, that's the new German 77. And judging by the sound, only about thirty-five miles away.
Strange. I know so very little about you.
I know very little about you, just the fact that you had your teeth straightened.
But be serious, darling. You are in danger and you must leave Paris.
No, no, no, no. We must leave.
No, no, no, no. We must leave.
Yes, of course, we --
Yes, of course, we --
-- The train for Marseilles leaves at five o'clock. I'll pick you up at your hotel at four-thirty.
-- The train for Marseilles leaves at five o'clock. I'll pick you up at your hotel at four-thirty.
No, no. Not at my hotel. I, uh, I have things to do in the city before I leave. I'll meet you at the station, huh?
No, no. Not at my hotel. I, uh, I have things to do in the city before I leave. I'll meet you at the station, huh?
All right. At a quarter to five. Say, why don't we get married in Marseilles?
That's too far ahead to plan.
Yes, I guess it is a little too far ahead. Well, let's see. What about the engineer? Why can't he marry us on the train?
Yes, I guess it is a little too far ahead. Well, let's see. What about the engineer? Why can't he marry us on the train?
Oh, darling!
Well, why not? The captain on a ship can. It doesn't seem fair that... Hey, hey, what's wrong, kid?
I love you so much, and I hate this war so much. Oh, it's a crazy world. Anything can happen. If you shouldn't get away, I mean, if, if something should keep us apart, wherever they put you and wherever I'll be, I want you to know...
Oh. I saved my first drink to have with you. Here.
No. No, Rick. Not tonight.
No. No, Rick. Not tonight.
Especially tonight.
Please.
Why did you have to come to Casablanca? There are other places.

I wouldn't have come if I had known that you were here. Believe me, Rick, it's true. I didn't know.

It's funny about your voice, how it hasn't changed. I can still hear it. "Richard dear, I'll go with you any place. We'll get on a train together and never stop."

Please don't. Don't, Rick. I can understand how you feel.
Please don't. Don't, Rick. I can understand how you feel.
Huh! You understand how I feel. How long was it we had, honey?
Huh! You understand how I feel. How long was it we had, honey?
I didn't count the days.
I didn't count the days.
Well, I did. Every one of them. Mostly I remember the last one. A wow finish. A guy standing on a station platform in the rain with a comical look on his face, because his insides had been kicked out.
Can I tell you a story, Rick?
Has it got a wow finish?
Has it got a wow finish?
I don't know the finish yet.
I don't know the finish yet.
Well, go on, tell it. Maybe one will come to you as you go along.
Well, go on, tell it. Maybe one will come to you as you go along.
It's about a girl who had just come to Paris from her home in Oslo. At the house of some friends she met a man about whom she'd heard her whole life, a very great and courageous man. He opened up for her a whole beautiful world full of knowledge and thoughts and ideals. Everything she knew or ever became was because of him.

Yes, that's very pretty. I heard a story once. As a matter of fact, I've heard a lot of stories in my time. They went along with the sound of a tinny piano playing in the parlor downstairs, "Mister, I met a man once when I was a kid," it'd always begin. Huh. I guess neither one of our stories was very funny. Tell
I'm sorry I was in no condition to receive you when you called on me last night.
It doesn't matter.
Why did you come back? To tell me why you ran out on me at the railway station?
Yes.
Yes.
Well, you can tell me now. I'm reasonably sober.
Well, you can tell me now. I'm reasonably sober.
I don't think I will, Rick.
I don't think I will, Rick.
Why not? After all, I got stuck with a railway ticket. I think I'm entitled to know.

Last night I saw what has happened to you. The Rick I knew in Paris, I could tell him. He'd understand. But the one who looked at me with such hatred... well, I'll be leaving Casablanca soon and we'll never see each other again. We knew very little about each other when we were in love in Paris. If we leave it that way,

Did you run out on me because you couldn't take it? Because you knew what it would be like, hiding from the police, running away all the time?

You can believe that if you want to.
You can believe that if you want to.
Well, I'm not running away any more. I'm settled now, above a saloon, it's true, but... walk up a flight. I'll be expecting you.
All the same, someday you'll lie to Laszlo. You'll be there.
No, Rick. No, you see, Victor Laszlo is my husband... and was, even when I knew you in Paris.
How did you get in?
The stairs from the street.
I told you this morning you'd come around, but this is a little ahead of schedule. Well, won't you sit down?
Richard, I had to see you.
Richard, I had to see you.
You use "Richard" again? We're back in Paris.
You use "Richard" again? We're back in Paris.
Please.
Please.
Your unexpected visit isn't connected by any chance with the letters of transit? It seems that as long as I have those letters I'll never be lonely.

I went through all that with your husband. It's no deal.

I know how you feel about me, but I'm asking you to put your feelings aside for something more important.

Do I have to hear again what a great man your husband is? What an important cause he's fighting for?

It was your cause, too. In your own way, you were fighting for the same thing.

I'm not fighting for anything anymore, except myself. I'm the only cause I'm interested in.
Richard, Richard, we loved each other once. If those days meant anything at all to you --
-- I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you. It's poor salesmanship.
-- I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you. It's poor salesmanship.
Please. Please listen to me. If you knew what really happened, if you only knew the truth --
Please. Please listen to me. If you knew what really happened, if you only knew the truth --
-- I wouldn't believe you, no matter what you told me. You'd say anything now to get what you want.
No. Oh, Richard, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but, but you, you are our last hope. If you don't help us, Victor Laszlo will die in Casablanca.
What of it? I'm going to die in Casablanca. It's a good spot for it.
-- All right. I tried to reason with you. I tried everything. Now I want those letters. Get them for me.
I don't have to. I've got them right here.
I don't have to. I've got them right here.
Put them on the table.
Put them on the table.
No.
No.
For the last time, put them on the table.
For the last time, put them on the table.
If Laszlo and the cause mean so much to you, you won't stop at anything. All right, I'll make it easier for you.
And then?
It wasn't long after we were married that Victor went back to Czechoslovakia. They needed him in Prague, but there the Gestapo were waiting for him. Just a two-line item in the paper: "Victor Laszlo apprehended. Sent to concentration camp." I was frantic. For months I tried to get word. Then it came. He was dead, shot trying to escape. I was lonely. I

Why weren't you honest with me? Why did you keep your marriage a secret?
Oh, it wasn't my secret, Richard. Victor wanted it that way. Not even our closest friends knew about our marriage. That was his way of protecting me. I knew so much about his work, and if the Gestapo found out I was his wife it would be dangerous for me and for those working with me.
When did you first find out he was alive?
When did you first find out he was alive?
Just before you and I were to leave Paris together. A friend came and told me that Victor was alive. They were hiding him in a freight car on the outskirts of Paris. He was sick, he needed me. I wanted to tell you, but I, I didn't care. I knew, I knew you wouldn't have left Paris, and the Gestapo would have caught

Huh. But it's still a story without an ending. What about now?
Huh. But it's still a story without an ending. What about now?
Now? I don't know. I know that I'll never have the strength to leave you again.
Now? I don't know. I know that I'll never have the strength to leave you again.
And Laszlo?
And Laszlo?
Oh, you'll help him now, Richard, won't you? You'll see that he gets out? Then he'll have his work, all that he's been living for.
Oh, you'll help him now, Richard, won't you? You'll see that he gets out? Then he'll have his work, all that he's been living for.
All except one. He won't have you.
I can't fight it anymore. I ran away from you once. I can't do it again. Oh, I don't know what's right any longer. You'll have to think for both of us, for all of us.
All right, I will. Here's looking at you, kid.
All right, I will. Here's looking at you, kid.
I wish I didn't love you so much.
Richard, Victor thinks I'm leaving with him. Haven't you told him?
No, not yet.
No, not yet.
But it's all right, isn't it? You were able to arrange everything?
But it's all right, isn't it? You were able to arrange everything?
Everything is quite all right.

Oh, Rick!
But why my name, Richard?
Because you're getting on that plane.
Because you're getting on that plane.
I don't understand. What about you?
I don't understand. What about you?
I'm staying here with him 'til the plane gets safely away.
No, Richard, no. What has happened to you? Last night we said --
-- Last night we said a great many things. You said I was to do the thinking for both of us. Well, I've done a lot of it since then and it all adds up to one thing. You're getting on that plane with Victor where you belong.

But Richard, no, I, I --
But Richard, no, I, I --
-- You've got to listen to me. Do you have any idea what you'd have to look forward to if you stayed here? Nine chances out of ten we'd both wind up in a concentration camp. Isn't that true, Louis?
I'm saying it because it's true. Inside of us we both know you belong with Victor. You're part of his work, the thing that keeps him going. If that plane leaves the ground and you're not with him, you'll regret it.
No.
No.
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of your life.
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of your life.
But what about us?
But what about us?
We'll always have Paris. We didn't have, we'd lost it, until you came to Casablanca. We got it back last night.
