Please be calm, Ambassador De Sade.
You will not get away with this vicious attack on our peace-loving people.
War-mongering bully! Don't think you're going to intimidate me!
All right, Mister Ambassador! But you must treat General "Buck" Schmuck with the respect due him.
Can I have a glass of water?
Certainly - how about some breakfast?

Thank you, Admiral.
Now, Mister Ambassador. In a very few moments we should have Premier Belch on the phone. I intend to tell him exactly what has happened. I merely want you to authenticate certain facts for him.

Well, it has been explained to me that, if you add a thick Cobalt-Thorium-G jacket to a nuclear device, the radio- activity resulting from such a nuclear explosion will retain its lethal power for a hundred years.
Our scientists calculated that the detonation of fifty of our biggest nuclear devices, jacketed in Cobalt-Thorium-G would enshroud the earth in a hundred years of lethal radio- activity from which no human life could escape. In ten months the Earth would be as dead as the Moon.

It is buried somewhere in the Grudd Mountains.
Mister Ambassador, what on earth possessed your country to build this weapon?
First of all, economic reasons. It was cheap. The entire project cost just a fraction of what we spent in a single year on our various space and missile programs. It also seemed ideal in most other respects. It was terrifying, convincing, automatic, and extremely simple to understand.
But, finally, one factor tipped the scales. We received information from a very re- liable source that your country was going to build one.
That's preposterous! We have no such program!
That's preposterous! We have no such program!
The source was...shall we say, completely reliable.
The source was...shall we say, completely reliable.
The report is entirely untrue. I can assure you of that.
Yes?
Allow me to assure you that my government will not be satisfied with a polite note of regret for this shocking example of aggression against our peace-loving people.
Damn you, de Sade! You know as well as I do that this was the act of a mentally sick man - a single individual, whose crack-up can probably be traced to the strains and tensions caused by your country.
It is very convenient to place all the blame on a dead man.
It is very convenient to place all the blame on a dead man.
How dare you talk to me in this manner?
This dreadful accident could never have happened if your government hadn't cynically and hypocritic- ally blocked every proposal we made for disarmament or arms control!!
Bah! All you wanted to do was spy in our country!

And surely you don't expect us to let you spy in our country before you destroy your weapons.
Don't you realize that despite your incredible distrust and suspicion, that in fact, you place a far greater trust in us than inspection would require? You trust us not to cause a war accidentally - and, of course, we are obliged to place the same trust in you.
And now, Mister President, I must return at once to my embassy to communicate this reassuring news to the Premier.
Goodbye, Mister Ambassador.
Goodbye, Mister Ambassador.
We have many splendidly deep mines in our country.
Excuse me, Mister President, but you forgot to give me my camera back.
Oh, yes, that's right.
Premier Belch will not be fooled by this fantastic lie.
Mister President, are you going to let this stooge talk to you like this?
Don't you dare touch me! What the devil do you think you're doing?
I caught you red-handed, Mister Ambassador.
I caught you red-handed, Mister Ambassador.
Give that back to me.
Give that back to me.
What do you think of this, Mister President? I told you we shouldn't let him in here.
Do you mean to say you'd set it off in your own country?
Naturally. It would kill us just as surely even if we set it off in your country. But this way we know it's safe, and we don't have the problem of delivering it.

Ah, but if we were able to untrigger it, that would be defeating its purpose. All our enemies would have to do, would be to warn us in advance that they were going to violate one of our unalterable triggering conditions. We would bluff, naturally, but in the end we would be insane not to untrigger it. Now we can say: There is no
Perhaps you gentlemen would like to check with the source?
You mean you'll tell us his name???
You mean you'll tell us his name???
It's not a he, General. It was an article in the "Times" about a year and a half ago.
Please, Mister President, I am extremely shy and do not wish to endure this sort of personal humiliation. Here is the only other camera I have left.
See! See, I told you.
My seven body orifices????

Now, snap out of it, fella!
Who the hell do you think you are, sir???
I did that for your own good, fella. Now I'm not going to pull rank on you. When this is over, I'll be happy to step outside with you and settle this thing. Right now my orders are to locate General Ripper and put him on the phone with the President.
Well, you can't do that because he's dead.
Do you have any witnesses, Major?
What?
What?
What happened, Major? Some kind of private beef between the two of you?

Okay, fella. But just move slow and don't do anything that might surprise me.
Sure...sure, Colonel. Now look, I'm picking up the phone...nice and slow. Right?...Hello? ...Hello? Hello?...Hello?...Gee, it must be edad. Probably the lines were hit during the fighting.
Now look, I'm picking up this ordinary telephone. See?...Hello?...Hello?... Nuts, the lines must still be disconnected. The General had us disconnect...

Operator...How much would the call be station-to-station?...Thirty-five cents cheaper?...I'd still be short twenty cents ...Just a second, operator... Colonel, shoot the lock off the Coke machine. There's bound to be enough change in there.
That's government property, Major.
That's government property, Major.
Colonel, remember, a reprimand from the President can be pretty serious to a career officer...Just a second, operator, I know I have it somewhere.

Yes!
General Schmuck?
General Schmuck?
Yes! Who the hell is this?
Go back to sleep, baby.
What did you say, sir?
I didn't say anything. What's the meaning of disturbing me at this hour, Colonel?
General Schmuck, we monitored a trans- mission about six minutes ago from Burpelson Air Force Base, HQ 843rd Wing. It was apparently directed to their Wing on air- borne alert. It decoded as - Wing attack, Plan-R.
Colonel, you're not drunk, are you, man?
No, sir.
No, sir.
Then why bother me with this nonsense? Get in touch with the base commander.
Well, that's ridiculous. If the teleprinter and radio links are out of order, just pick up a phone and pay for a call.
I know it sounds crazy, sir, but we tried, and nobody answers any of the telephones.
Does the threat board show anything?
Well, that's the funny part of it, too, sir. It doesn't show a damned thing.
Well, Mister President.
What kind of trouble?
What kind of trouble?
Well, sir, about forty-six minutes ago one of my base commanders, General Jack D. Ripper, sent out attack orders to the thirty-four B-90's of the 843rd Bomb Wing, under his command.
General Schmuck?
Yes, sir. He issued attack orders to --
May I be stupid enough to inquire WHY IN HELL THE BASE COMMANDER OF THE 843d BOMB WING DID A THING LIKE THAT ???
To be perfectly honest, Mister President, we really aren't sure.
To be perfectly honest, Mister President, we really aren't sure.
You aren't sure!

Not exactly, sir. You see, Colonel Puntrich at Air Command HQ received a call from him about twenty minutes ago.

They're on their way in, and I advise you to get the rest of Air Command in after them. My

Be fair, Mister President. Didn't we initiate the Human Reliability tests for all personnel handling nuclear weapons?
Buck, when I told you to give them right up to the top, you said we couldn't insult a general officer by asking him to pass a test to see if he's a psycho.
Just a second, sir. He's got films of the War Room in that thing!
I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to take the film out.
Yes, sir. One thing, Mister President.
Yes?
Yes?
Under a condition red alert, the base will probably be sealed off and defended by the base security troops.

And lastly, all privately owned radios are to be immediately impounded. They can be used to issue instructions to saboteurs. Air Police will have lists of all owners.
What's the gun for, General Ripper?
Please don't take any notice of this weapon, Major. I love all weapons, and as of late, I've just taken to keeping a loaded weapon nearby at all times.

And if that were true?
But then, sir, why have you issued the order: Wing attack, Plan-R?
Because I thought it proper, Major. Why else would you think I'd do it?
Suppose that were the case?
But -- why...that would be an awful thing to do, sir.
But -- why...that would be an awful thing to do, sir.
Perhaps, Major. Perhaps. Pour me a scotch and soda, please. And help yourself to whatever you like.
Don't fret about it, Major. There's nothing anyone can do about it now. I'm the only one who knows the three-letter code group for the CRM-114.
I know that, sir.
I know that, sir.
We've come a long way since World War II, Major. And the lessons we've learned are all in Plan-R.
I suppose they are, sir.
You're damned right they are.
You're damned right they are.
How much soda, sir.
How much soda, sir.
Just a squirt.
That about right?
Perfect. Thank you, Major. And now let's drink a toast.
What shall we drink to, sir?
To peace on earth.
General Ripper, can I ask another question?
Ask away, Major.
Ask away, Major.
Well, General -- I was wondering, why are you doing this? I mean why do you want to start the war?

You see, Major, at this very moment, while we sit and chat, a decision is being made by the President in the War Room. He knows that the enemy will pick up our planes on their radar in about twenty minutes.

But when they do, sir, won't they hit back with everything they've got?

Well, I think I remember reading the report on that. Wasn't it something like a hundred and sixty million?

That's close enough, Major.
That's close enough, Major.
But then why do you want to kill a hundred and sixty million of our people, sir?

I suppose we might catch them off their guard.
Our missiles would impact before my planes were even discovered by the enemy, wouldn't they?

I guess so.

I know so, Major. I know so. And add to that, the whole Air Command force being committed to clobber everything they've got.
I know so, Major. I know so. And add to that, the whole Air Command force being committed to clobber everything they've got.
But even then, we wouldn't get everything. I mean some missiles would abort, or they'd miss their targets, or maybe the enemy have some secret bases we don't know about.

You're absolutely right. You forgot to mention their nuclear subs. But it wouldn't matter. Sure we wouldn't get off without getting our hair mussed, but we'd prevail. I don't think we'd lose more than fifty million people, tops.

Major Mandrake, I guess you don't follow what's going on too closely, do you?
Major Mandrake, I guess you don't follow what's going on too closely, do you?
Where, sir?
Where, sir?
Where? Everywhere, Major. Everywhere.
Well, I know they've been going on for years, and they haven't gotten any place.
Not yet, Major. Not yet.
Not yet, Major. Not yet.
And I guess they won't until they agree to let us inspect inside their country.

You're very naive, Major. Don't they say they want disarmament?

Yes, sir. But so do we.
Yes, sir. But so do we.
But we mean it because we are a peace- loving country. Are they a peace-loving country, Major.

I don't know, sir. But they're just as anxious to avoid a nuclear war as we are. War just doesn't make sense any more, for anybody.
I don't know, sir. But they're just as anxious to avoid a nuclear war as we are. War just doesn't make sense any more, for anybody.
But war doesn't make sense precisely because the weapons can kill an entire country -- right?

Right.
Right.
Then don't you realize the Bomb gives us Peace not War? And, if that's the case, I ask you again: Why do they want disarmament?
Then don't you realize the Bomb gives us Peace not War? And, if that's the case, I ask you again: Why do they want disarmament?
Well, sir, like I said, for the same reasons we do. I mean, all the experts say the most likely way for War to start nowadays is by an accident, or a mistake, or by some mentally unbalanced person --
Go on, Major.
I was just going to say, as long as the weapons exist, sooner or later something's going to happen -- and that'll be it for both countries.

Go on, Major. You fascinate me.
Go on, Major. You fascinate me.
Well, sir, I remember an example that pointed out that if a system was safe on 99.99% of the days of the year, given average luck it would fail in thirty years.
I still ask, why do they want disarmament?
Well, for the same reasons we do, sir. Don't you see?
Well, for the same reasons we do, sir. Don't you see?
No, Major, I don't. They have no regard for human life. They wouldn't care if they lost their whole country as long as they won.
No, Major, I don't. They have no regard for human life. They wouldn't care if they lost their whole country as long as they won.
Gee, sir, that last remark doesn't exactly make all the sense in the world.

No, sir. I'm sure we wouldn't.
Do you think they would cheat?

Look, sir. I'm no expert on the subject, but I've read some pretty sharp ideas the big boys have. Like, say, both countries agreeing to a million dollar reward and international protection for anyone who gives evidence of cheating to the inspectors. You can't hide those things without a lot of people knowing about it. And if I were going to try and hide

Major, I hate to say this, but I think you've been enemy indoctrinated, and you don't even know it.
Major, those are my boys out there dying.
Yes, sir. Why don't you stop the fighting, sir?
To peace on earth, Major.
Peace on earth.
General, now that you've done that, I beg you to recall the Wing.
Major, I happen to believe in a life after this one, so I believe I will have to answer for what I have done. I think I can.
It was a honest mistake, sir.
I presume the planes are armed?
I presume the planes are armed?
I'm afraid so, Mister Presient. Being part of the air-borne alert, each plane is carrying a full load - about fifty megatons apiece.

Yes, sir. The base commander, General Ripper, selected Plan-R?
Yes, sir. The base commander, General Ripper, selected Plan-R?
What the hell is Plan-R?

Why can't you cancel it?
Why can't you cancel it?
Once the orders have been given, Plan-R requires any new orders to be received on the CRM-114 in the aircraft. But the CRM-114 will not receive any transmissions unless they are preceded by the proper three-letter code group.

And I suppose you're going to tell me you don't know what the three-letter code is.
Mister President, to guard against espionage, the three letter of the code group for Plan-R are always selected by the lower echelon commander himself, just before each mission. They are sealed in the various attack plans and are known only to the lower echelon commander and his deputy. In this case the deputy is air-borne with the Wing, and General Ripper refuses to recall
How soon until the enemy finds out what's going on?
We estimate the planes should be entering their coastal radar cover in about twenty-five min- utes.

How could you let this happen, General Schmuck?
How could you let this happen, General Schmuck?
Mister President, I know you think I've let you down, but we had to have a Plan-R. If we completely centralized the command and control, all a potential aggressor would have to worry about was knock- ing out maybe half a dozen headquarters and the Capitol, and we'd be out of business.

Then there's no chance for recall?
Then there's no chance for recall?
I should say practically none, though we have our communications center plowing through every possible three-letter combination. The trouble is that there are about seventeen thousand permutations, and it will take us approximately four and a half days to go through them all.
General Jack D. Ripper, sir.
I want to talk to General Ripper.
I want to talk to General Ripper.
But we can't communicate with the base.
I don't think that's a fair analogy, sir.
Admiral Buldike?
But he'll hear everything we're saying. And if he just looks out of that window, he'll see everything we're doing.
That's the idea, General Schmuck. Zlat!
We don't operate like you KGB boys.
Knock it off will you, General? Crudley, find out what's holding up that call!
Have you received acknowledgements from every plane?
They're coming in now.
They're coming in now.
How long will it take to receive them all?
How long will it take to receive them all?
I'm not certain, Mister President. The boys in CONCOM do the pencil work.
I believe it will be just a few minutes, at the most.
How many planes did we lose?

I'm not certain, Mister President. But I believe it was four.

General Schmuck, are you positive of your figures?
Naturally I am, sir.

Hello, are you still there?...Uh-huh...I'll be right back. We're still working this thing out.
How do you know they were shot down, Buck?
Well, just common sense, sir. Thirty from thirty-four equals four, or my name's not "Buck" Schmuck!
Yes?
Well, sir, it looks like one aircraft, the "Leper Colony", failed to receive the recall.
Well, sir, it looks like one aircraft, the "Leper Colony", failed to receive the recall.
Have you tried the recall again?
Have you tried the recall again?
Yes, sir. We're still sending it. But it's a funny thing we don't seem to be able to make any contact with the aircraft at all.
Yes, sir. We're still sending it. But it's a funny thing we don't seem to be able to make any contact with the aircraft at all.
What's the target.
What's the target.
Well, the Premier doped it out pretty well. Its primary is their missile base at Laputa.
Is there any chance a single aircraft can penetrate the entire enemy Air Defense, when its course and target are known?
If I can speak freely, sir -- look, these guys talk big, but frankly, we think they're short of know-how. You can't just take a bunch of ignorant peasants and expect them to understand a machine like one of our boys, and I don't mean that as an insult, Mister Ambassador.

General, stick to the point, please.
General, stick to the point, please.
Well, sir, if the A/C's a really good man, I mean really sharp, why he can barrel that plane along so low - well you just have to see it some time. A real big plane, like a Sting Ray, zig-zagging in, its jet exhaust frying chickens in the barnyard --- Has he a chance?.....Hell, yes! He has one hell of a chance.
You've lied to me twice - I'm sorry, but it will be strictly routine. These men are experts.
Zlat, make sure the secret service boys care- fully search his seven body orifices.
Yeah, to see if we're on our toes.
No, they wouldn't send us in with bombs on an exercise.
Give me a first rough course as soon as you can, Lieutenant Ballmuff.
Roughly, one-zero-five. I'll have it plotted in a minute, Major Kong.

Hey, Terry, I'm hit.
Well, listen, King. Could you take her up to about eight hundred? That'll help you come in at a nice down-angle, and it'll give us a chance for our chutes to open.
Sure, I'll take her up to eight hundred.

I just got another blast on the CRM-114, and the damned thing decodes: Wing Attack, Plan-R.

No, this looks like the real thing.
Yeah, it sure looks like the real thing, all right.
Okay. Check these points. Complete radio silence. To ensure that the enemy can't plant false transmissions and fake orders, the CRM-114 is to be switched into all receiver circuits. The three code letters of the period are to be set on the alphabet dials of the CRM-114, which will in turn block any transmissions other than those preceded by the code letters. You got

Quentin, how's your gear?
No, look! It's "OPE - Recall Mistake."
Recall what mistake?

No, I think it means, "Recall period Mistake," and the OPE is probably the CRM-114 code. Terry?
You sure have to hand it to those guys.

Come on, King. That doesn't make sense.
Come on, King. That doesn't make sense.
Okay, how do we know they didn't shoot down one of our planes and torture the crew? How do we know that?
We crossed the coast over an hour ago. Okay?
You're giving them an awful lot of credit for being on the ball.

Sorry, King.
Sorry, King.
Forget it. Okay, team, let's break it up and get ready for the kick-off.
Who's that?
It's me - Lothar. Are you okay?
It's me - Lothar. Are you okay?
I'm okay. What's up?
I'm okay. What's up?
Well, I hate to say this, but I think the bomb bay doors are stuck.
Well, I hate to say this, but I think the bomb bay doors are stuck.
Are you sure?
Are you sure?
Well, I can't get out and look, King. But I don't get a green light.
Well, I can't get out and look, King. But I don't get a green light.
Maybe the warning system's out.
Maybe the warning system's out.
But I get a red light.
But I get a red light.
Have you tried the emergency system?
Have you tried the emergency system?
I tried everything. Something must have gotten bent or twisted from the pounding we took.
Lothar, can you arm the bombs for impact?
But I TOLD YOU, I don't think we can get the bomb bay doors open.
But I TOLD YOU, I don't think we can get the bomb bay doors open.
I asked you a question, Lothar!
I asked you a question, Lothar!
But how are we going to drop the bombs if the doors won't --- Hey, King....you're not thinking of --- You don't mean you'd --- ???
There's no other way, Lothar. Can you re-arm the bombs for impact?
Let me check.
Let me check.
There's no other way, boys. I'm going to have to take her in...the hard way.
I think it's okay, King. They should go off on impact.
Would it matter if they hit at a flat angle? I mean, do you think the deuterium mass might separate from the atomic trigger?
Would it matter if they hit at a flat angle? I mean, do you think the deuterium mass might separate from the atomic trigger?
Well, it would probably help if you took it ...sort of...straight down.
Well, it would probably help if you took it ...sort of...straight down.
Roger.
We're on course, Major. Just fixed our position on that river back there.
What the hell are you doing here, Lothar?
I thought I'd go along for the ride.
Now what the hell did you want to go and do a thing like that for, Lothar?
Now what the hell did you want to go and do a thing like that for, Lothar?
I thought maybe you'd like some company.
King, would you mind if I keep me hands on the wheel when you take her in?
I'd be mighty proud if you did, Lothar.
I'd be mighty proud if you did, Lothar.
Thanks, King. I've always wanted to take one of these big babies in.
Thanks, King. I've always wanted to take one of these big babies in.
Listen, Lothar. You know that crack I made about your...butt?
Listen, Lothar. You know that crack I made about your...butt?
Forget it.
Forget it.
I just wanted you to know I didn't mean anything by it.
I just wanted you to know I didn't mean anything by it.
Sure, King.
Sure, King.
Well, I just wanted you to know how I felt. Hell, I know Air Command wouldn't have taken you if you weren't okay. And don't think I don't know some of our best ball-players and entertainers are of Negro descent.
At the bottom of mines?
Yes. The radioactivity could not penetrate a mine some thousands of feet deep.
In a matter of weeks, sufficient improvements for a dwelling space could be provided.
But they couldn't come out for a hundred years!
But they couldn't come out for a hundred years!
Mister President, man is an amazingly adaptable creature. After all, the conditions would be far superior to those, say, of the Nazi concentration camps, where there is ample evidence most of the wretched creatures clung desperately to life.
It would not be difficult. Nuclear reactors could provide power almost indefinitely. Greenhouses could maintain plant life. Animals could be bred and slaughtered. A quick survey would have to be made of all the suitable minesites in the country, but I shouldn't be surprised if several hundred thousand of our people could be accomodatedd. Every nation would undoubtedly follow suit.
But who would be chosen?
But who would be chosen?
A special committee would have to be appointed to study and recommend the criteria to be employed, but off-hand, I should say that in addition to the factors of youth, health, sexual fertility, intelligence, and a cross-section of necessary skills, it would be absolutely vital that our top government and military men be included, to impart the required principles of leadership and tradition.
When they emerge, a good deal of present real estate and machine tools will still be recoverable, if they are moth-balled in advance. I would guess they could then work their way back to our present gross national product within twenty years.
But, look here, Von Klutz. Won't this nucleus of survivors be so shocked, grief-stricken, and anguished that they will envy the dead, and indeed, not wish to go on living?
But, look here, Von Klutz. Won't this nucleus of survivors be so shocked, grief-stricken, and anguished that they will envy the dead, and indeed, not wish to go on living?
Certainly not, sir. When they go down into the mine, everyone else will still be alive. They will have no shocking memories, and the prevailing emotion should be one of a nostalgia for those
Uh, yeah, she should be coming by.
Uh, well, what'd she say? Is Pony coming?
Uh, well, what'd she say? Is Pony coming?
I don't know.
We are?
Alright. She told him to meet us here. Fuck.

"Burger Manifesto, Part One" is gonna make people think?
Um-hm.
Wait. Racism? You don't know anybody who's black!

Knock yourself out.
You know, one moment things are so fucked up than you look at it from a totally different angle and it makes sense.

No. Oh, maybe. Fuck.
I mean, that would suck if you had to go back to rehab.
I mean, that would suck if you had to go back to rehab.
Yeah, it would suck big time. I'd kill myself first.
Yeah, it would suck big time. I'd kill myself first.
It was pretty bad, huh?
It was pretty bad, huh?
It was like hell with windows. You know, there's shit on the walls. Kids my age sucking their thumbs. I mean, every day I would, I'd wake up in my cell and I'd think, my parents put me here. Why? Why? Because I stayed out all night one time. Uh, because I broke the VCR when I was drunk. Because I was out of
We were all riding around and it suddenly hit me what we were doing. We were getting off on the fact that we're in a car teen feet longer than all the rest. And I got out and I just started walking.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, what it was... I, I don't want to admit it, but, you know, I was jealous of Pony.

Well, sure, he's rich and he's famous. He's got everything and you've got nothing.
Yeah, but, when I was walking, I realized that he's stuck in that limo all the time. He's stuck with his interviews, he's stuck with his autograph, he has to do whatever his manager tells him to do, you know? He's not free. He's just part of the machine, and if you think about it, freedom's all that there really is.

You know? And it used to scare me so much that I didn't know what was coming in my life.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
You know, like, like, I would always think, uh, you know, what if I make the wrong move? But maybe there isn't any right move. You know? I mean, look at us. You know, we all dress the same, we all talk the same, we all fuck the same, we all watch the same TV. Nobody's really different, even if they think they're different.
That was really great.
Was it okay?
Was it okay?
Yeah!
Yeah!

Yo, your gettin' me all upset here.

You should get upset. Everyone should get upset. When, when Hitler was greasing the Jews, people were saying, "Don't get me upset. Your bumming me out." My duty as a human being is to be pissed off.

I wouldn't. If I were in his shoes, every morning I'd get up singing, man. Do my work-out, take a shower, followed by a hearty breakfast, steak and eggs, washed down with a pot of hot coffee, six pack of Coors Lite. Then I'd order my bodyguard to go find my babe, who would appear decked out in her all-black leather Victoria Secret custom-made

Oh, God, that would be something I really want to do.
Okay, now, you guys all take care, okay? Oh, man, I feel so good. I feel good 'cause I'm hanging out with you guys, man. You know? I mean, I forgot what it was like to just hang out.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And you know why it's so good? See, because, see, you guys are real. No, man, I mean it. You guys have a sense of humor. You live your lives, you know. It's simple, you know. The guys on the road, I mean, the band, all they talk about is scoring chicks... and Danny, all Danny talks about is money.
Yeah, come on, play it.
Oh, no, man. I can't.
Alright, alright already.
Alright!
"Drove down the highway there was a big jam The family had died There inside their minivan There was a backup It went on for miles But as bad as it was It was gone after a while" Chorus here. "You may think there's nothing to it and the truth is hard to see To be an invisible man is a remarkable thing to
That was so great!
You know, that is my worst fear. Making a sound and no one hears it.
Mine too.
Jesus, Jeff.

Oh, yeah, you're just so smart.
Oh, yeah, you're just so smart.
That's because I am.
I hate it here. It's so ugly, it's like being dead. You got out of here, you know? I'm ready to go.
Yeah, but sometimes I try to figure out why I left in the first place, you know? I think about people and I wonder what they're doing.

Is that Jeff?
Oh, my god!
You know, my mom has this saying.
Yeah?
Yeah?
"Don't write any checks you can't cash."
"Don't write any checks you can't cash."
Really? What else does your mother say?
Tim, why don't you shut the fuck up?
I think I gotta go.
What the fuck are you talking about?!
Nobody's fucking anybody!
Well, uh, there's this benefit for Rwanda we're gonna do. And, uh, you know, my songs, uh, where I get the ideas for them, uh, you know, stuff like that.
Where do you get your ideas?
"See what's around you listen to their lies"
So, like, your dad's a big deal, right?
Ooh, wow, nice. Personal trainer? Very nice.
"I sound like an idiot watching the parade I know there's no tomorrow only the charade I am dead Deep inside my head All the lies There's no then Only now I will love show me how"
Tim?
Uh, I didn't write any songs. You guys go ahead. I gotta stay here and guard the parking lot.
Where's Erica? You seen her?
Erica? She said she was tired. She went back to the hotel.
Erica? She said she was tired. She went back to the hotel.
Oh, How'd she get back?
Oh, How'd she get back?
I called Bucky's. I got her a cab. Is there any hot mustard?
Well, I called Erica's beeper. There's just no answer.
What are you? Her pimp? She said she might go get a drink first.

Okay. You know what? Watch your fucking language, alright? Or I might have to.
Whatever.

Oh, come on, Pony. I'm just kidding. Wow, you rock stars are really sensitive, huh? You know, there's a life on the road?
Oh, come on, Pony. I'm just kidding. Wow, you rock stars are really sensitive, huh? You know, there's a life on the road?
Don't do that, man, okay?
You know, man, it's none of your business what I do, okay?
It's none of my business?
It's none of my business?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, okay, it's none of my business. Yeah, so, you-you're trying to fuck my best friend's girlfriend and it's none of my business?!

Missed it. Can I get a fifth of Old Crow?
Just one?

Yeah.
I don't, I don't remember. What do I owe you?
Uh, eleven twenty-five.
Yeah. Yeah. How's the air force, Tim?
It's not the air force anymore, Scuff
It's not the air force anymore, Scuff
So where are you?
So where are you?
I'm here.
Yes, that's right. You know what, honey? You should go to New York. You should go. Go show 'em. They need your unique point of view.
At least I have a point of view, you know?
Seriously? It's a great idea.
Ha! Thank you! See? He did it. He left.
Ha! Thank you! See? He did it. He left.
I did. I split, man. I expanded my horizons, you know. Served my country. Saw the world, you know? I've gained wisdom and now I'm back, baby, back from the road. Me and Jack Kerouac.
Why don't you go back to where you came from?
Hey, Tim.
Hey, Tim.
No, see, sweetheart, you don't want to stand up for parasite 'cause I can fuckin' smell him from here. You know what? Tow words, man: roll on.
Make a move. Greasecake. Towel-head.
Hey, Tim, you know what? You win.
Hey, Tim, you know what? You win.
Fucking drunk, huh?
Fucking drunk, huh?
You have the largest penis. Can we go please?
Hey, your gonna regret this.
Come on, Jeff.
Leave him alone, Tim.
Uh, excuse me, I'd like to know where he gets his ideas.
Uh, excuse me, I'd like to know where he gets his ideas.
Tim's jealous, you know? He wants to have ideas too.
Tim's jealous, you know? He wants to have ideas too.
Yeah. Yeah, I'm jealous of MTV faggots who are named after animals.
Yeah. Yeah, I'm jealous of MTV faggots who are named after animals.
Jeff!
Ew! Oh, Buff! Relax!
Why don't you fucking relax? He's having verbal intercourse, Sooze.
Buff is funny, okay? She likes Buff, so why don't you whip shut the feminist hole.
Hey, why don't you swallow your cock and choke on it? Oh, I forgot, it's not big enough.
It was the nicest thin I've done in a long time.
Oh that's nice for you.
Forget about New York, Jeff. I don't want to talk about New York anymore.
There was this other place where they served live monkey brains. Sweat to God. You walk in, they bring the little monkey out, shave his head, crack it open, and you eat it's brains while it's still alive. I didn't go in, though, 'cause I didn't have any money and my mom has a saying: "Don't write any checks you can't cash".
Could you give me a ride?
Oh yes! Yeah, man, give her the ride, the ol' Pony ride back to the hotel.
Oh yes! Yeah, man, give her the ride, the ol' Pony ride back to the hotel.
Tim, go throw up somewhere.
I'm going out later.
No car.
No car.
The fuck not?
The fuck not?
You know the fuck not.
You know the fuck not.
Fuck.
Fuck.
Don't swear it's impolite.
Wait! Did you say you are pregnant or you were pregnant... You had it, threw it out and you're gonna go back and dance all night!
Shut up, Cleo. Di, how much do you need for an abortion?
What?!
You piece-a-shit bug zapper!
I can't believe your grandparents never come down here.
You have three heart attacks and a half dozen strokes and tell me how much you wanna run up and down the stairs. Shit - I forgot to pick up the cigarettes.
Who are you - the goddamn Bionic Woman?!
I just pulled and it - it came off.
I just pulled and it - it came off.
This is great - GREAT! Now we have to enter the front door!
This is great - GREAT! Now we have to enter the front door!
Look, it's really not my fault.
Hey! Rule number one - never take off the mask! Y'hear me! No matter what happens, NEVER TAKE OFF THE MASK!
Sorry, Kansas...
Sorry, Kansas...
NO-GAH-BUH- NO! Rule number two - NO NAMES! NO GODDAMN NAMES, you retard!
NO-GAH-BUH- NO! Rule number two - NO NAMES! NO GODDAMN NAMES, you retard!
Oh for Chrissakes... "White trash Betty." I didn't realize the rules went into effect before we entered Safeway.
Oh for Chrissakes... "White trash Betty." I didn't realize the rules went into effect before we entered Safeway.
Well, use your head, "Stalker Betty."
Holy shit.
You just became a statistic!
I'm in, too.
Cleo!
Cleo!
Kansas is right. We're like sisters -- we're closer than sisters. And you don't turn your back on family.
And you know real cops aren't half as smart as Keanu.
Forget it. I've got a scholarship to Harvard hanging over my head. I won't risk it.
Forget it. I've got a scholarship to Harvard hanging over my head. I won't risk it.
Conan went to Harvard.
Ahh! Baby's got two heads!!!
It's twins!!
Can you guys believe this? We're like celebrities!
Better enjoy it now. 'Cause tomorrow some little kid falls down a well and we're nothing but a distant memory.
Another sex dream?
Wayne Gretzky.
Di, are you okay? We can skip the girl party this week.
Everything's fine. I'm just having a little trouble keeping my frown upside down.
...He slices off the guy's ear, and I mean you see everything - the bloody pink hole where the --
Cleo, I've already thrown up twice today - could you please get to any relevant part of the movie?
Cleo, I've already thrown up twice today - could you please get to any relevant part of the movie?
Well...uh...they, y'know, uh... They had nicknames.
Di, we're sorry. We...
It's off... I can't take the fighting, the back-stabbing, the open hostility. We're not acting like cheerleaders, we're acting like a bunch of sorority girls!
Is Jack upset that he can't be here?
Hee-hee-haaaa-weee worked it out. Heee hee-haaa....
Use the bathroom, because the Port-a Potties on the field are gross.
My fault - What do we do that enables us to be as great as we are?
My fault - What do we do that enables us to be as great as we are?
I personally think of how Conan started as a writer, then became a...
Hello?
Di? I just called to say that Conan talked about us again last night.
Di? I just called to say that Conan talked about us again last night.
Thanks, Cleo. See you tomorrow.
Thanks, Cleo. See you tomorrow.
Bye.
Diane? Diane!
Huh-ha-wha? Ahh! I'm under the ice! I'm uh -- oh...man... That was a weird one.
Oh my G-d, you've been robbed!
No...I've been pregnant.
Look, you're fat, Diane. You're fat, fat, fat! Because you eat, eat, eat! What?! She keeps asking because she wants some honesty.
No I don't... I keep asking because I feel fat.
No I don't... I keep asking because I feel fat.
Oh G-d, I'm sorry... You're not really fat! I was just saying that because, uh, I thought that's what you wanted me to say.
Oh G-d, I'm sorry... You're not really fat! I was just saying that because, uh, I thought that's what you wanted me to say.
You sure?
You sure?
Positive.
Positive.
"Positive" you're sure I'm not fat or "positive" I'm...
Oh my G-d, I read about this! It's called a "pregnancy insanity." Quick, she needs a sitz bath --
Look, I might be moody. I might be gassy. But I am perfectly sane. Think about it. In school, they tell us, "Dreams can come true." Right?
C'mon, Luce, people do it in the movies all the time.
And they get caught!
And they get caught!
That's right. So all we have to do is watch a bunch of movies and learn from their mistakes.
No.
If you don't - can you still afford to go to Harvard?
If you don't - can you still afford to go to Harvard?
... I don't know. Probably not.
... I don't know. Probably not.
So then this isn't crazy. It's a sure bet.
So then this isn't crazy. It's a sure bet.
Well...
But, we have to make a smart plan!
Of course - of course! Hands in...
Okay, even with all our savings, it's still only six hundred fifty-four.
Hee-hee-hee, haaaaa-that's it? Hee-hee hee...
-- We practice! Sorry, Cleo.
That's right. Practice makes perfect. I'm practicing to have a baby right now. If we do a practice job, we'll not only get the experience, but also the extra money we need for guns!
Di, it's Luce. Kansas just called and said she's going to "fuck me up!" Then I heard coughing, a thud and Kansas had to go. I think her Grandma had another heart attack. Anyway, why does she want to "fuck me up?"
She thinks you went to the police.
She thinks you went to the police.
WHAT?! That's insane!!! Why would I go to the police?
WHAT?! That's insane!!! Why would I go to the police?
I've got to get that. Relax. I'll see you tomorrow.
Hi, Jack.
Excuse me, Vendela, have you seen Diane? We're supposed to go to the homecoming dance tonight.
... so when your dad said, "I never want to see your "f-'in' faces again!" do you think he meant forever or just until your mom wakes up?
I don't know... And what the hell was that sound she made right before she hit the coffee table.
I don't know... And what the hell was that sound she made right before she hit the coffee table.
Well, if I had to guess... I'd say that was the sound of a mother saying good-bye to her little boy and hello to a young man who's going to be a daddy of his own... Jack, do you know what I see here?
Well, if I had to guess... I'd say that was the sound of a mother saying good-bye to her little boy and hello to a young man who's going to be a daddy of his own... Jack, do you know what I see here?
Spit from your dad?
Spit from your dad?
I see a flower. And y'know, even the most beautiful flowers still grow from dirt.
I see a flower. And y'know, even the most beautiful flowers still grow from dirt.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So, while we're knee deep in right now - and things seem pretty "stinky" - in the long run, we're going to grow strong from this.
So, while we're knee deep in right now - and things seem pretty "stinky" - in the long run, we're going to grow strong from this.
Y'think?
Y'think?
I sure do.
I sure do.
Diane, I've loved you ever since I first saw you -- right before you kicked me in the head.
Diane, I've loved you ever since I first saw you -- right before you kicked me in the head.
Oh, Jack...
Jack, sweetie, I'm only eating for two.
But Di, all this food reminds me of how much I want to teach our baby.
Like Cocoa Puffs. Good. Captain Crunch. Bad. Shreds the roof of your mouth. I mean you hear, "Tricks are for kids!" And you think, "I'm a kid, I guess they're for me." But your baby brain's got no idea that Fruit Loops are, like, a million times better. I'm going to save our kid all that pain.
Jack...
Jack...
If you could be Count Chocula, Frankenberry or Trix the Rabbit, who'd you be?
If you could be Count Chocula, Frankenberry or Trix the Rabbit, who'd you be?
Trix...
Trix...
Me too! Will it ever end?! I love this lady!
Jack, I think I should get a job.
But we agreed your job is running the baby machine...
But we agreed your job is running the baby machine...
I know, but that was before.
I know, but that was before.
Ah! I almost forgot gas for the baby machine. I'll grab your Snickers and get a place in line.
I never knew you dreamed of working in a grocery store bank branch. Baby, we are living the great American Dream!
Mmm-hmmm...
If you reach for the stars, you're bound to get -- mm-Jack, pull over.
Huh? Oh Jesus...
Uh, Jack - look, I can explain...
Diane, there's no excuse for not taking your pre-natal vitamins. Now, if you guys were really friends, you'd remind her to take these.
...so although their dad said, "Don't get out of the car until I get back with help," they knew the sheriff's voice as he yelled. "Run to my voice - and don't look back." The twins did as he said, but at the last second they turned around and saw the escaped mental patient, bouncing their father's head on the top of the car!
That was gas, Sweetie.
That was gas, Sweetie.
Oh... What are you working on?
Oh... What are you working on?
Jus some girlie things for the squad.
I'm sorry.
What?! But all our paperwork's there. My school records, Jack's football records...
What?! But all our paperwork's there. My school records, Jack's football records...
Let me explain something...
Let me explain something...
No. Wait! Did I say Promise! Cross-my heart and hope-to-die, stick-a-needle-in my-eye we'll never miss a payment?!
No. Wait! Did I say Promise! Cross-my heart and hope-to-die, stick-a-needle-in my-eye we'll never miss a payment?!
Uh, yes. Yes you did.
...do not accept charity. We are two young, able-bodied Americans. We do not want a handout. We want a hand-up. Give us food and we will be hungry tomorrow. Give us corn - the kind you plant, not eat - and we'll grow our own food and... and, uh, then cut it, and - uh, y'know eat it! Now, if you're interested in giving
Sorry. My hands are tied.
Anyway, last time I checked, you still had to have sex to have an orgasm. And I know she ain't seen the lord on all fours - so I'm just saying.
Well, I want to know what happened --
Nope. Sounds more like the first.
I'll just ask the question myself... "Is Jack Bartlett interested in me?"
Madonna.
We're here for you, Diane.
Hat-trick?
He is the Great One...
"No" you're not sure or "No" I'm not fat?
Uh, "no"... You're not fat.
Uh, "no"... You're not fat.
You sure I'm not fat?
Listen, Kansas, I know you dream of springing your mom some day...
Stop, you're gonna make me cry.
Stop, you're gonna make me cry.
And if the O.J. trial taught us anything, it taught us that in America, you can cut off someone's head and still be found innocent if you have enough money. Your mom only shot a guy...
Shut up.
Lucy, do you know for sure you're going to get that scholarship?
Kansas!
I'm sorry, Diane, but I'm not gonna watch my dreams fade away 'cause the Virgin Mary here thinks she's gonna get ideas from kiddie movies --
It's all my fault. I'm sorry I ever started this...
Di, it's not your fault. We all wanted to do this - for you... for ourselves.
Oh, thank G-d! I'm not just super fat!
Oh - okay, we ain't done with this... Those babies are gonna get a good start in life - with a real crib - one that costs a shit-load! We're gonna learn how to rob a bank from the only people who really know how to do it - criminals! I'm gonna visit my mom!
NO! Wait...um... We're the A-squad from Lincoln High? So, uh...
We were told you could "fix us up."
Hey. Eyes on your own belly!
Hee-hee-h-wait a minute. Hold on, now. What do we do before a big game?
Oh no...
He Ikea'd us.
It was Lucy! Lucy went to the cops!
Remember, Kansas, every time you point a finger you've got three more pointing back at you.

Don't use big bills!

Oh thank Buddha it's you, Kim-Lo, I'm being held against my will, my civil rights have been violated and it took four days to make this one phone call...
Oh thank Buddha it's you, Kim-Lo, I'm being held against my will, my civil rights have been violated and it took four days to make this one phone call...
Hello?

No. This is Diane. I think you have the wrong number.
No. This is Diane. I think you have the wrong number.
Ooops, that's me -- gotta run!
Ooops, that's me -- gotta run!
Wrong number Nooooooo!
Yeah?
I guess there's an exception to every rule.
Well, we'll each probably want one - so let's make it five. Five should do it.
Okay. How much ammo you reckon you'll need?
Okay. How much ammo you reckon you'll need?
Ammo?
Ammo?
Bullets.
Bullets.
Bullets? No bullets! Oh my gosh, these are just to scare people. Kinda like round-off, back handspring, whip back, double full. You never really use it - you just want the opposing squad to know you've got it.
Bullets? No bullets! Oh my gosh, these are just to scare people. Kinda like round-off, back handspring, whip back, double full. You never really use it - you just want the opposing squad to know you've got it.
Right. That'll be fifteen hundred - cash.
Hey, hey, hey. C'mon you guys. Obviously that's a little more than our budget will allow. Basically, we're looking for something around two-hundred dollars.
Oh, why didn't you say. For two-hundred I got a nice rubber band and a real sharp nail in back... I'll gift wrap it for you. The deal is fifteen hundred. Cash. Take it or leave it.
My daughter's always dreamed of bein' a cheerleader. Put her on your squad and I'll give you the guns.
You're kidding.
You're kidding.
Fern! C'mere! She's siphoning tanks - takes a sec to cap off the cyanide hose.
... Ja-ck B-ar-t-le-tt... Is Jack Bartlett interested in me?
I-I'm sorry - can someone else please run the Ouija board? It's creepy, it's wrong and it goes against the teachings of my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
I-I didn't mean to say "whore," Diane. I just hear it so much at church - it kinda came flying out of my head.
I know, Hannah. Look, I'm not going to get an abortion. I mean, I always planned to get married and have kids - I'm just going a little out of order. Kinda reminds me of another young lady who found herself "with child," unmarried, on a long road, with no place to sleep. 'Course, that was a long-long time ago. But no matter what,
You want us to help you pick up?
Don't Martha-fucking-Stewart me! If you don't like it - you try being a pregnant teen!
And Hannah, you could give your share to your church - or maybe buy one of those hungry little kids Sally Struthers advertises.
Or, I could get my own horse...
Or, I could get my own horse...
Or that! Look, you guys, I just want to provide a future for my baby. I know my bank branch like the back of my puffy little hand. I could open that safe in my sleep!
Look, maybe I can watch a PG movie... I'll just say I'm counting dirty words for Sunday School.
That's okay, Hannah. It was silly to think we could learn to rob a bank from watching movies. Sex - you can learn from movies. But robberies? There's no way.
Hello?
We're dead! They showed this prison movie to my youth group on Sunday.
We're dead! They showed this prison movie to my youth group on Sunday.
Hannah, we've...
Hannah, we've...
It wasn't like the prison we saw - all these women had to shave their heads because they got lice from the filthy lives they'd lived! Oh G-d, I'm gonna be someone's bald bitch!
It wasn't like the prison we saw - all these women had to shave their heads because they got lice from the filthy lives they'd lived! Oh G-d, I'm gonna be someone's bald bitch!

Hold on...
Screw Lucy!

Shit! Yeah, Grandma. Me and the squad.
Shit! Yeah, Grandma. Me and the squad.

Are you girls talking about boys? Practicing kissing your hands?
Oh yeah, you caught us...
Oh well, then I'll put some cookies at the top of the stairs for you gals.
Thanks! That'd be great.
You got that big retarded girl down there?
Uh...Yeah, Grandma. She doesn't mean that. Kinda lost the old filter with her last stroke.
Uh...Yeah, Grandma. She doesn't mean that. Kinda lost the old filter with her last stroke.

Oh please, we've all got bright futures ahead of us - we're not going to tell anyone. Promise!
Maybe we can make a deal.
Hannah, in order to get real answers from the netherworld, you've gotta have a Christian virgin run the board. Your kind is pure of heart - the devil won't dick with you.
Well technically, I don't think I'm a virgin anymore.
Yeah. This summer at church camp? I'm pretty sure I had, y'know, an orgasm.
Hold up, hold up. Any sentence that starts with "at church camp" ain't leading to the big "O."
Oh my G-d! I'm not first!
But you're not married.
...so, while it's a laugh riot for the whole family, and Tim Conway is just about as funny as they come, especially when he goes...

Stop it! This is crazy!
What the hell do you want?
I want to help. I'm part of this squad...
I hate to think where that puts me. I could be her father.
I'm terribly sorry, Mr. de Mille.
It must be about that appalling script of hers. What can I say to her? What can I say?
I can tell her you're all tied up in the projection room. I can give her the brush ...

I almost reported you to the Bureau of Missing Persons. Fans, you all know Joe Gillis, the well-known screen writer, opium smuggler and Black Dahlia suspect.

Say, you're not really smuggling opium these days, are you?
Where's the bar?
Good party.
The greatest. They call me the Elsa Maxwell of the assistant directors. Hey, easy on the punch bowl. Budget only calls for three drinks per extra. Fake the rest.

Don't worry. She's just a fan for my literary output.
Walking out on the mob. What's the big idea?
I'm sorry about New Year's. Would you believe me if I said I had to be with a sick friend?

Someone in the formal set, no doubt, with a ten-carat kidney stone.
The accent! I've got it: this guy is in the pay of a foreign government. Get those studs. Get those cuff-links.
I've got to run along. Thanks any- way for your interest in my career.
Hello, Mr. Sheldrake. On that Bases Loaded. I covered it with a 2-page synopsis. But I wouldn't bother.

I just think pictures should say a little something.
Carefull Those are dirty words! You sound like a bunch of New York critics. Thank you, Miss Schaefer.
Goodbye, Mr. Gillis.
If I could be of any help...
I'm sorry, Mr. Gillis, but I just don't think it's any good. I found it flat and banal.
I'm sorry, Mr. Gillis, but I just don't think it's any good. I found it flat and banal.
Exactly what kind of material do you recommend? James Joyce? Dostoosvsky?
Perhaps the reason I hated Bases Loaded is that I knew your name. I'd always heard you had some talent.
That was last year. This year I'm trying to earn a living.

Except for about six pages. You've got a flashback there ...

Now if I got you correctly, there was a short stretch of my fiction you found worthy of notice.
The flashback in the courtroom, when she tells about being a school teacher.

Hello, Artie. Good evening, Miss Schaefer.

I haven't been keeping myself at all. Not lately.
I haven't been keeping myself at all. Not lately.
I called your agent. I called the Screen Writers Guild. Finally your old apartment gave me some Crestview number. There was always somebody with an accent growling at me. You were not there. You were not to be spoken to. They never heard of you.

Sorry, Miss Schaefer, but I've given up writing on spec.
I tell you this is half sold.

As a matter of fact. I've given up writing altogether.
It's not your career -- it's mine. I kind of hoped to get in on this deal. I don't want to be a reader all my life. I want to write.
Sorry if I crossed you up.

Just so you don't think I'm a complete swine -- if there's anything in Dark Windows you can use, take it. It's all yours.

Goodbye, young fellow. We'll see what we can do.
I'm not worried. Everything will be fine. The old team together. Nothing can stop us.

It was the room of the husband. Or of the husbands, I should say. Madame has been married three times.
Hey, what's this with the door? There isn't any lock.
There are no locks anywhere in this house.
How come?
The doctor suggested it.

What doctor?

Madame's doctor. She has moments of melancholy. There have been some suicide attempts.

No, I haven't. I suppose all the waxworks are coming?
No, I haven't. I suppose all the waxworks are coming?
I don't know, sir. Madame made the arrangements.
How is she?
She is upstairs.
Mr. Gillis, if you please.
Right with you.
You see those offices there, Mr. Gillis? They used to be her dressing room, The whole row.
That didn't leave much for Wallace Reid.

He had a great big bungalow on wheels. I had the upstairs. See where it says 'Readers' Department'? I remember my walls were covered with black patent leather...
What's the matter, Max?
I just found out why all those tele- phone calls. It is not Miss Desmond they want. It is the car they want to rent.

She never will. That is my job. It has been for a long time. You must understand I discovered her when she was eighteen. I made her a star. I cannot let her be destroyed.

I directed all her early pictures. There were three young directors who showed promise in those days: D.W. Grirrith, C.B. deMille, and Max von Mayerling.

It was I who asked to come back, humiliating as it may seem. I could have gone on witn my career, only I found everything unendur- able arter she divorced me. You see, I was her rirst husband.
Joseph C. Gillis?
That's right.
We've come for the car.
What car?
Relax, fans. The car isn't here.
Is that So?

You say the cutest things.
All right, Gillis. You've got five minutes. What's your story about?
It's about a ball player, a rookie shortstop that's batting 347. The poor kid was once mixed up in a hold- up. But he's trying to go straight -- except there's a bunch of gamblers who won't let him.

Got a title?
Bases Loaded. There's a 4O-page outline.

Get the Readers' Department and see what they have on Bases Loaded.
Oh, you're one of the message kids. Just a story won't do. You'd have turned down Gone With the Wind.
No, that was me. I said, Who wants to see a Civil War picture?
Well, seems like Zanuck's got himself a baseball picture.
Mr. Sheldrake, I don't want you to think I thought this was going to win any Academy Award.

Could I? Gillis, last year some- body talked me into buying a ranch in the valley. So I borrowed money from the bank so I could pay for the ranch. This year I had to mortgage the ranch so I could keep up my life insurance so I could borrow on the insurance so I could pay my income tax. Now if Dewey had

Goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake.
So you need three hundred dollars? Of course, I could give you three hundred dollars. Only I'm not going to.
No?
No?
Gillis, get this through your head. I'm not just your agent. It's not the ten per cent. I'm your friend.
How's that about your being my friend?
Don't you know the finest things in the world have been written on an empty stomach? Once a talent like yours gets into that Mocambo- Romanoff rut, you're through.

Well, it's one way to get her down stairs.
Okay. And let's have the car right outside.
Bring something to drink.
Yes. Madame.
Wait a minute. I want you to get out the car. You're going to take the script over to Paramount and deliver it to Mr. De Mille in person.
Yes, Madame.
Madame is wanted on the telephone.
You know better than to interrupt me.

Thank you, Max.
Cameras? ...What is it, Max?
The cameras have arrived, Madame.

They have? Thank you, Max. Tell Mr. DeMille I will be on the set at once.

You and your husband have been kind to me, Alura. I have something to tell you: I'm going away. Soon.
But where?
I've discovered a new way into the Phantom Zone.
But the phantom Zone is for criminals.
But the phantom Zone is for criminals.
It's big. And empty. I'm tired of limiting myself to Argo City. I want to do something new. I'm starting to repeat myself here with this airy, glittery stuff....
I'm an artist, Alura. My work comes first. Other people come second.
How can you create beauty...with a selfish heart? The spiky insect-creature flies closer and closer around the little girl's head, buzzing angrily. Her look of delight turns to fear. She tries to shoo the creature away. It flies off toward the thin membrane that encloses the city.
But the Power Source, Zaltar.
It couldn't be helped. The city will have to make do with three.
It couldn't be helped. The city will have to make do with three.
But what will happen?
But what will happen?
The Guardians will be angry. They may even send me to the Phantom Zone. You see, I didn't really have permission to borrow it. I must go explain to them...
I said stop, I didn't say run into a brick wall.
What is it?
What is it?
The Coffer of Shadow. Look at it.
What does it mean?
The danger. The one Nigel spoke of. It must be near .
Oh, fiddlesticks. What could be dangerous about a baseball game?
Softball.
It must be the girls. One of the girls.
But which one?
But which one?
Drive on. We have already attracted enough attention.
We'll bide our time and keep watch. Young girls just can't keep a secret. If one of them's up to something--we'll find out.
And then, like great cats---we pounce! And destroy!
Bianca, try not to be so bloodthirsty when you're at the wheel. OK?
Sorry, mistress.
Is he your entertainment for tonight?
He will be. In about five minutes.
He will be. In about five minutes.
Have fun.
I came as quickly as I could. What is the danger?
It's what we were warned about.
A Storm Dragon?
No, a super girl.
Why did she have to show up now?
Eliminate her.
Eliminate her.
That's easy for you to say, Bianca.
That's easy for you to say, Bianca.
You can do it. You're the most powerful woman on Earth.
You can do it. You're the most powerful woman on Earth.
Am I? Still?
Yes! You own the Coffer of Shadow. Nothing can withstand its power.
I've been saving it. For the right moment.
I've been saving it. For the right moment.
That moment is now! What good is a sword unless it be unsheathed? Use it, and no one will dare oppose you again. No one.
What do I do? I don't know her name.
The Naming of Names is not necessary. Just concentrate on her face. Your Shadow will do the rest.
Next time, remind me to do this out in the yard.
Yes, of course, it was foolish of me.
I think I'd better keep it.
Whatever you say.
Whatever you say.
Yes. Whatever I say. From now on.
Home?
No way. I'm not going to let that little hussy make a monkey out of me.
No way. I'm not going to let that little hussy make a monkey out of me.
Is it her that's bothering you--or your gardener?
Sure glad you didn't let make a monkey of you.
Shut up, and get me a hacksaw.
I don't feel like it right now.
She didn't take it from you, did she?
She didn't take it from you, did she?
That little girl? Ha. Now go on, get me some tools.
That little girl? Ha. Now go on, get me some tools.
There's no need. I learned the Craft from my grandmother.
At last. Ultimate Power.
And the first thing we do is get rid of Supergirl!

What do you mean we?
I don't want much, Selena. I have simple tastes.
What do you want?
What do you want?
Western Europe.
Western Europe.
I'm sorry, but I already promised Bianca she could have Switzerland. You know how she loves to ski.
I'm sorry, but I already promised Bianca she could have Switzerland. You know how she loves to ski.
No problem. She can have it. I hate mountains.
Is this Nigel's doing?
It's a warning, that's for sure.
It's a warning, that's for sure.
Maybe it was just an accident.
Maybe it was just an accident.
There's no such thing as an accident. Everything has meaning, if you can read the signs.
Wait...don't leave me in here...
It's for your own protection.
What's happening?
I'm taking you to the hospital.
I'm taking you to the hospital.
Let me out. I have to talk to you.

Later.
Don't leave me.
I have to.
I have to.
When can I see, you again ?
When can I see, you again ?
Relax. Tomorrow this will all seem like a bad dream. Goodbye.
You're alive! She didn't kill you!
Who didn't?
Who didn't?
That woman who's after me. She hates you. Because she knows I love you.
That woman who's after me. She hates you. Because she knows I love you.
You love me?

My angel. My goddess. I feel I've always loved you all my life. I'll die if I can't spend the rest of my life just looking at you, holding you in my arms...

This is my favourite place in the city.
Are you sure it's all right for us to be here?
Are you sure it's all right for us to be here?
They don't care, they're tearing it down for a shopping centre.
Like it?
Yes. It reminds me of home.
Yes. It reminds me of home.
Where Superman's from? Krypton?

It's not important. The important thing is I'm here to find something and I think you can he1p me.
Come on, let's ride.
I used to work here summers when I was a kid.
Ethan, tell me more about this woman who's after you.
Ethan, tell me more about this woman who's after you.
Let's talk about us, not her.
Let's talk about us, not her.
Tell me where I can find her.
Tell me where I can find her.
I don't want you to go near her. She's bad news.
But be reasonable. If I don't do something to stop her she'll try again. And maybe hurt you.
I'll be safe with you. We can stay together the rest of our lives.
I'll be safe with you. We can stay together the rest of our lives.
We can't do that.
We can't do that.
Why not ?
Why not ?
We're from different worlds.
We're from different worlds.
Just give me a chance to show how much I love you. Love changes everything. Love makes everything possib1e.
All this talk about love, it's silly.
You don't like me? You hate me?
Of Course I don't hate you. I don't hate anyone.
What do you feel about me?
There's one sure way to find out how you feel.
What's that?
What's that?
Let me kiss you.
Let me kiss you.
No.
No.
You're not afraid are you?
You're not afraid are you?
Of course not, but...there are things we don't understand.
Of course not, but...there are things we don't understand.
If we wait until we understand everything we'll be dead. Come on. You can learn more from one kiss than from years in school.
If we wait until we understand everything we'll be dead. Come on. You can learn more from one kiss than from years in school.
Well...I guess one is all right.
Is this how?
Terrific.
I thought I'd show you one of my favourite places.
It's paradise . We could be very happy here.
It's paradise . We could be very happy here.
But I have to go back. I brought you here so you'd be safe. From her.
But I have to go back. I brought you here so you'd be safe. From her.
You can't just abandon me. Alone.
Great! I'II build a house-- right over there, with a veranda looking out to sea. And I'll plant a garden! Papayas, pineapples, bananas, mangoes--- anything'll grow here. And I'II fish in the lagoon, and we can go sailing in a dugout canoe, and---
Ethan---when I said 'a while' I meant a couple of hours.
She said it wouldn't last.
What wouldn't last? What's the matter with you?
I don't love you any more.
Just like that?
Just like that?
Like turning off a light.
Away. From you.
But why?
But why?
Because you remind me of all the dumb things I said.
Because you remind me of all the dumb things I said.
I sort of like what you said.

That makes it worse.

But I don't understand.
Hi.
Hello. Are you still mad at me?

I'm not mad at you.

It seemed that way to me.

I know I was acting funny---I'm sorry. It's just...I miss it.
I know I was acting funny---I'm sorry. It's just...I miss it.
Miss what?
Miss what?
What I had before. What's not there now. It's like I woke up and found part of me wasn't there any more: something that made me feel really alive and aware of things. It was like, for the first time in my life, everything fitted together perfectly---you and me and the world around us--like we were a wonderful song...
And now?
And now...the guitars are out of tune, and the words don't make sense, and somebody unplugged the mike...
You think so?
I don't see why not.
I don't see why not.
But what if---it wasn't real?
But what if---it wasn't real?
Feelings are real. Once you've had them, they're yours forever.
Hey, listen, when all this blows over, maybe we could get together every now and then and see each other. And maybe something might. happen again. What do you think?
Are you asking me for a "date"?
Are you asking me for a "date"?
Why not? You're a good-looking girl. And I'm--- available.
Why not? You're a good-looking girl. And I'm--- available.
Aren't you forgetting about Selena?
Aren't you forgetting about Selena?
She'll forget about us eventually.
There's something very dangerous about her. Something evil...
I know what it is. She has this lead container shaped like a gargoyle. Inside there's a silvery ring...
That's the Power Source that was lost from Argo City! That's what I came: to find! Where does she live?
In this big old house on Orchard Avenue---but you better stay away from there.
In this big old house on Orchard Avenue---but you better stay away from there.
I can see through walls. I could surprise her. The only thing I can't see through is lead, that's why I didn't see the Power Source at the amusement park.
Wait. Don't leave me.
You'll be safe here. I'll come back as soon as I have the Power Source.
Before you go...
What?
What?
Just one kiss. For old times' sake.
And you can see how you feel about me, right?
Yes.
You've had your fun, Selena, the game is over.
She has hostages.
It's her shadow-self! Her dark side!
How do I fight it?
How do I fight it?
Turn it against her.
No thanks. I have friends in the resistance. They'll vouch for me. I figure I might get a million bucks for my memoirs.
I'll come back as soon as I can.
She's right. They'll string her up.
Do you want to come to Argo City?
Hey! Ethan!
Hmmm?
Hmmm?
Remember me? We were in a disaster together.
A little.
Can you get us out? It's all a misunderstanding. We thought they were selling hamburgers in that place.
Can you get us out? It's all a misunderstanding. We thought they were selling hamburgers in that place.
I'll mention it upstairs.
Hey, I thought you were gonna mention us upstairs.
I did.
I did.
Well thanks a pile, fella.
Finished your estimate?
Well, there's several ways to go .
Well, there's several ways to go .
Come in, have a drink, we'll talk.
You must be very popular in the neighborhood. I always see your truck parked around.
I have a lot of repeat business. People seem to like my service.

I'll drink to that.
Oh no, not you again.

Why should I believe you?
Why should I believe you?
It's the truth. In twenty-four hours you'll forget all about that girl.
Yes, yes I saw the whole thing. How could you be interested in that puny little girl?
But she is real, it wasn't just a concussion.
But she is real, it wasn't just a concussion.
Forget her, you're mine. I saw you first.
Nurse! Nurse!
You can't escape from me that easily. I'm afraid you don't know who I am.
You can't escape from me that easily. I'm afraid you don't know who I am.

Don't think I'm weak, just because I'm a woman. I have Power. Give in, stop fighting me, Ethan. I always get what I want.
Don't think I'm weak, just because I'm a woman. I have Power. Give in, stop fighting me, Ethan. I always get what I want.
Nurse! Help !
This is your problem, right here. This girl's driving you insane, Ethan. Let me help you.
I don't want your help.
I don't want your help.
Come back to my house. My car's outside.
No!
I never met a man I couldn't have--and you're no different from the rest!
I'm wise to your tricks, lady.
I could force you.
I could force you.
If that worked, you would've done it already. No, you want me to drink it of my own free will. Well let me tell you, sweetheart, it'll be a cold day in hell before I fall for that one again.
If that worked, you would've done it already. No, you want me to drink it of my own free will. Well let me tell you, sweetheart, it'll be a cold day in hell before I fall for that one again.
Go on, talk big! I'll soon have you purring like a kitten.
You've been without water for a whole day. Let's see how thirsty you get in a week.
You vicious--
You vicious--
Careful, don't make me angry. I start fires when I'm angry.
They want me. Doesn't it make you proud?
Yeah.
Guess! Go on.
I don't know. You seem afraid.
I don't know. You seem afraid.
You're a regular Einstein, aren't you?
You're a regular Einstein, aren't you?
Supergirl?
You can't put her out of your mind, is that it?
Well...I guess I can't.
Well...I guess I can't.
I'm ready for her. I'll show you.
Why the empty cage?
That one was for you. But I thought I'd wait and see how you behave when Supergirl gets here. I'd hate to lose you, Ethan.
You sure are a good cook, Selena. Man, that looks too pretty to eat.
Better eat it quick. It won't look too pretty when it's all covered with ants.
Selena, I've been thinking. It's time I settled down---and I don't know a nicer lady to settle down with than you.
Why George, are you proposing?
Why George, are you proposing?
Marry me, Selena. The hardware store doesn't bring in much now, but...
Marry me, Selena. The hardware store doesn't bring in much now, but...
George---I thought you'd never ask.
Hey, where you going?
I've got things to do.
I've got things to do.
What about my proposal?
What about my proposal?
Call me next week. Maybe we can have lunch.
Nice to meet you. Lucy's told me all about you. Your cousin Clark taught me everything I know about the newspaper business.
Nice to meet you.
Do you have any theories about last night?
Theories?
Theories?
How Lucy and that guy got to the hospital. And all that damage at the school. The police are calling it a freak tornado. I'd like to interview you for the Daily- -
I believe there's a rational explanation for everything. But I don't know what it is.
Can I quote you?
Where is your cousin Clark, by the way?
He's off doing a top secret uh, investigation.
He's off doing a top secret uh, investigation.
I knew it ! He's working on a hot scoop !
Gosh, what do you suppose .that is?
Well, Lucy, it's nice to see you're feeling better. Nice to meet you, Jimmy.
Can I give you a lift?
Oh, no thanks.
Oh, no thanks.
It's no trouble. I'd like to ask you some more questions.
Someone's chasing him.
Say---you think that's the same guy who was in the accident with Lucy?
Say---you think that's the same guy who was in the accident with Lucy?
Yes.
Yes.
The scoop of the year!
Oh, Jimmy, can't you forget about your career for one second?
-- Planet. I mean, you were there. Do you think it was natural, or like some people are claiming, supernatural?
Jimmy, would you please put those poor flowers in water before they die?
Oh, sure.
I had to dump the papers in a trashcan. The Danvers have been arrested!
How do you know?
How do you know?
I saw them dragged out of the Administration Building.
I saw them dragged out of the Administration Building.
Did anybody notice you?
Did anybody notice you?
I can't help it if men notice me.
I can't help it if men notice me.
Lucy! Be serious. We could be executed for treason!
I sure wish Superman was around. He wouldn't let any of this go on. Not for one minute.
I wish they'd tell us what they're going to do with us.
I wish they'd tell us what they're going to do with us.
I heard stories. I don't think you wanna know.
I've been in love with you for years. Remember how you used to visit your sister in the newsroom? And put your fingerprints on my lens.
Remember? I was trying desperately to get you're attention.
Remember? I was trying desperately to get you're attention.
You were? You mean we could've been... you-know-what... all this time?
You were? You mean we could've been... you-know-what... all this time?
You bet your ass.
You bet your ass.
Why didn't you tell me?
Why didn't you tell me?
You're supposed to guess.
I am almost an adult. This is what I want.
But Kara, no one has ever gone from here to Earth. The journey is dangerous.
But Kara, no one has ever gone from here to Earth. The journey is dangerous.
It was my fault we lost the Power Source.
It was my fault we lost the Power Source.
Years ago. And it was Zaltar who stole it.
Years ago. And it was Zaltar who stole it.
I allowed it to escape the City.
Superman will return it.
Why haven't you been able to contact him? He should have returned from the neutron galaxy ages ago. He may be dead. ZOR-EL But what can you, a mere girl-
Be brave, my .daughter. Be wise.
As brave as my father. As wise.
What are you making:
It's going to be a tree, I think.
What's a tree?
It's something they have on Earth. You know, where your cousin went.
It's something they have on Earth. You know, where your cousin went.
Where is Earth?
Where is Earth?
Didn't you study six-dimensional geometry in school?
Didn't you study six-dimensional geometry in school?
Yes, I know the equations---I just can't see it in my head.
Even I have trouble with that sometimes. Earth is in outer space. And we're in inner space.
I don't understand.
I don't understand.
Wait till you're older. Here -- watch this.
You see, a tree is a living thing.
Can you create life?
I'm sorry... I didn't know.
It was my fault. You aren't old enough to use the wand. I shouldn't have given it to you.
I can do that.
No sweat. When's the rest of your stuff arriving?
There isn't any.
This is all your clothes?
I have money to buy more, but I haven't had a chance since...
Since what?? Did you have a fire at your house or something?
Since what?? Did you have a fire at your house or something?
I'd rather not talk about it.
I'd rather not talk about it.
You're not...an orphan are you?
You're not...an orphan are you?
My cousin Clark is my only relative on Earth.
My cousin Clark is my only relative on Earth.
Oh wow, I should've known. Me and my big mouth. Listen, you can borrow any of my clothes you want. Any time.
Oh wow, I should've known. Me and my big mouth. Listen, you can borrow any of my clothes you want. Any time.
Thank you. You're very kind.
She did that deliberately.
She's a beast.
How'd you do that?
Must've been a defective puck.
Keep an eye peeled for Myra. She's out to get you.
But what for?
But what for?
She just hates anybody who isn't afraid of her.
Your hair looks the same.
It was just a trim.
No thanks. You go on.
You sure?
Linda babes! There's this all-night party at Eddie's... his folks are away...
Oh, I don't know. I'm not signed out for an overnight.
Oh, I don't know. I'm not signed out for an overnight.
Go back, sign in, and climb out the bathroom window. McCloskey's always zonked out: she'll never hear you.
Go back, sign in, and climb out the bathroom window. McCloskey's always zonked out: she'll never hear you.
It doesn't seem right.
It doesn't seem right.
Please, as a favour to me? So I won't be the only girl?
Why is he acting so strangely?
I dunno, but he's gonna get creamed.
Lucy; come back!
Somebody's gotta do something!!
I'm afraid I have some bad news about your car.
Mr. Danvers called. I'll get a new one with the insurance money. B.F.D.
Listen, I know I've been saying you ought party more, but keep your hands off this one, will yak? He's private property. I've been waiting years for him to develop.
He's nice.
He's nice.
Nice? He's cute enough to melt lead!
You're not gonna stay for the ice cream?
I have to get back. I'm having dinner with the Danvers.
I have to get back. I'm having dinner with the Danvers.
Again? You're getting real tight with them. You're gonna be a straight-A student---just kidding, thanks for coming.
Don't you believe in knocking?
Oh, yes. Knocking. The pre-entry signal. I forgot.
What can I do for you?
I'm Linda Lee.
I mean, it would probably be there, if you received it.
Here it is. Oh...of course. You're the orphan. I'm so sorry about your parents. We'll try to make you happy here.
No plans for the weekend, Linda?
No, MR. Danvers.
No, MR. Danvers.
Can't have you moping around the campus. Why don't you come home with us for dinner?
Can't have you moping around the campus. Why don't you come home with us for dinner?
I'd love to.
Thank you both so much. It was a lovely lunch, Mrs. Danvers. I had a wonderful time. And you're a terrific chess player MR. Danvers.
What? Me?
What? Me?
Sure. Mate in five moves.
Cheer up, Nigel. It's not the end of the world.
It may well be. I know how you won that election Selena. You can't fool me.
It may well be. I know how you won that election Selena. You can't fool me.
I have plans Nigel. You could come with me... I'm going places.
I have plans Nigel. You could come with me... I'm going places.
You're not going anywhere. Except back to nowheresville. You're too impatient, Selena. Look around you--all these people have served years and years of apprenticeship. Some of their families have been in the Craft for generations. You can't join and take over our whole organization in a few months.
I just did. Because I have the Power.
You're going to pay a terrible price. The power of Shadow is tricky. Use it too much and it takes over.
Bianca's taught me all! need to know. I'll be safe, as long as I don't go too far.
Cigarette?
Nigel, get out of here. And don't come slithering back. Nigel shakes his head.
You need me, Selena. I'm the only one who can save you from a terrible fate.
You need me, Selena. I'm the only one who can save you from a terrible fate.
I need you like an Eskimo needs a lawnmower. Now burn rubber.
Balefire on you, Selena!
You Scorpios can never take a joke.
You think you are on top now. Well there is someone coming to challenge you. I saw it in the cards this morning.
Throw him out.
Nigel, get lost.
I have to talk to you.
I have to talk to you.
You're wasting your breath.
You're wasting your breath.
You used to listen to me. When you asked me to teach you something of the Craft.
You used to listen to me. When you asked me to teach you something of the Craft.
I could teach you a thing or two now.
...trust the wisdom of the ancients, trust the Great Mother to protect us... Why. are you staring at me like that?
I was just thinking, if I had your skin problems, I'd use a good tannisroot ointment. Every night.
Nothing's wrong with my skin.
Such a shame. You ought to take better care of yourself.
You better have a pretty good explanation for this, Selena.
We are in great danger. A being has come to Earth with powers far beyond those of anyone member of the Craft.
Which of you is willing to make that sacrifice?
You would! You revealed our existence so you could have all of our power.
You would! You revealed our existence so you could have all of our power.
Maybe you'd like to get rid of this Supergirl yourself, Nigel?
Maybe you'd like to get rid of this Supergirl yourself, Nigel?
Why get rid of her at al1? You've used the Coffer of Shadow too much. It is beginning to rule your heart.
Why get rid of her at al1? You've used the Coffer of Shadow too much. It is beginning to rule your heart.
Nonsense.
That was meant for me!
Thank you. I'm going to close this up again.
Who are you ?
I am Selena. Give him to me. Now. Or you'll both be sorry.
I am Selena. Give him to me. Now. Or you'll both be sorry.
I don't scare that easily.
That ought to keep you out of my hair for a while.
A cheap trick.
A cheap trick.
Cheap but effective.
The Danvers. And two of your little friends.
It's just one more crime you'll have to pay for.
You've run out of things to throw, Selena.
Not yet.
I'm free. I can never thank you enough.
For what?
Ever since I found that thing I've been like a prisoner in a terrible nightmare. You have no idea how awful it is to be mean all the time.
Your nightmares are over. I'm taking this back to Argo City where it won't be misused. You could come too. It might be safer for you.
What's it like?
It's the most beautiful place in the universe.
It's the most beautiful place in the universe.
Sounds O.K. to me. Let's go.
Where is inner space?
It's everywhere. But water is always the door.
They'll be grateful. If you hadn't found it, it would still be lost. Look, up ahead.
Yes, I see it. Shining like a jewel.
Yes, I see it. Shining like a jewel.
That's home.
What is this place?
This is the Phantom Zone. But why did you come here from Argo City?
This is the Phantom Zone. But why did you come here from Argo City?
I was on Earth...
I was on Earth...
Earth? You crossed the dimension barrier? By yourself?
Earth? You crossed the dimension barrier? By yourself?
Yes. I went there to find the lost Power Source...
Shouldnt've done that.
...but the person who has it. tricked me, and sent me to the Phantom Zone.
...but the person who has it. tricked me, and sent me to the Phantom Zone.
It's dangerous to use a Power Source on Earth. It can unleash all sorts of terrible forces---
It's dangerous to use a Power Source on Earth. It can unleash all sorts of terrible forces---
I know.
I know.
Well, nothing we can do about it. Come into my house. You can stay with me, until I build you your own place. I expect you won't want to mix with the others-- not our type of people.
Others?
Criminals.
...mid pleasures and palaces though I may roam..."
What? Palace? Hardly.
What? Palace? Hardly.
Just feels, a little, like a tiny bit of Argo City...
It's lovely. . .
No, no. Not lovely. 'Perfect'. Did everything just right. Nobody telling you to change this, move that around. Please yourself. That's the secret of happiness.
No, no. Not lovely. 'Perfect'. Did everything just right. Nobody telling you to change this, move that around. Please yourself. That's the secret of happiness.
Are you happy, Zaltar?
Are you happy, Zaltar?
What kind of a question is that? Of course: I am. I do whatever I want. All the time.
What kind of a question is that? Of course: I am. I do whatever I want. All the time.
But what about other people? Don't you miss them?
You look at them? How?
The Phantom Zone overlooks everywhere.. If you have the right tools.
That horrible woman!
Told you. Wouldn't listen to me. Knew it would make you sad.
Zaltar, please help me.
Of course, my dear. What can I do?
Of course, my dear. What can I do?
Help me to get back to Earth. Where my friends are. They need me.
There's no way out of the Zone. No one's ever escaped. That's why they send the criminals here.
If there's a way in, there must be a way out.
If there's a way in, there must be a way out.
No, that's not true---there's well...no--
There is a way.
I knew it!
I knew it!
But it's impossible.
But it's impossible.
Why?
Why?
No, it wouldn't work, you couldn't, it's too--- if it didn't work you'd be swept into a singularity--- no, you'd never make it. Forget I mentioned it.
Then teach me how.
No, it's no good---you can't practice--- you only get one go. A thing like that. No. Sure you don't want a sip of this? It's delicious, I think.
Takes a long time, you know, learning the wand. Just begun to understand it myse1f. Give things a kind of life--can also take away life; works backwards too. Besides I can't let you take my wand. Only have the one, what would I do? I'd be helpless. It's out of the question.
Then come with me.
Then come with me.
Leave the zone? What would I do on Earth?
Leave the zone? What would I do on Earth?
You could do anything. You could sculpt mountain ranges...draw with rainbows! You'd have superpowers.
You could do anything. You could sculpt mountain ranges...draw with rainbows! You'd have superpowers.
Superpowers. Got you in a lot of trouble, didn't they?
Superpowers. Got you in a lot of trouble, didn't they?
Please. I have to get back to Earth. My friends are in trouble. And unless I bring back the Power Source, Argo City will die.
You're going to take me back?
Going to try. Didn't say I could.
I heard my mother ask you once "how could a man with such a selfish heart create beauty?" She was wrong, Zaltar, you have a generous heart.
Not doing this for you. Just sick of this place, that's all. Wretched singing sculptures, always yowling at you. Boring!
You can use the wand.
Better than when I was a child.
What's that? Never saw anything like that.
Don't stop. Keep moving.
Don't stop. Keep moving.
Yes, mustn't stop.
Yes, mustn't stop.
It's Selena. I'm getting so I can recognise her work.
Zaltar. Use the wand!
Too late. Too late. Save yourself.
Goodbye...
Zaltar!
Yeah? What do you want?
Buddy, are we in trouble.
What?
First the supplier couldn't find the invoice. Then the order came up short. Then I missed the four o'clock plane from Cleveland and had to rent a car, and then I got a darn flat tire on the highway! Can you beat it? Boy, your boss must've been furious when I didn't show up by the end of the day today, huh?
What are you talkin' about?
Good lord, fella! I'm talking about your boss.
Good lord, fella! I'm talking about your boss.
Mr. Roebush?
Mr. Roebush?
Roebush! That's the guy! Buddy, he's gonna nail our behinds to the wall! this is Special Order! He said he had to have it before... Omigod!! What's tomorrow?
Roebush! That's the guy! Buddy, he's gonna nail our behinds to the wall! this is Special Order! He said he had to have it before... Omigod!! What's tomorrow?
Tuesday.
Tuesday.
TUESDAY! I got to get it all set up in his office tonight before all those big shots come here tomorrow for the meeting!!
S'not bad, s'very good, but... y'know what's wrong with this... Singapore...thing?
Sling. Singapore Sling. What's wrong?
Sling. Singapore Sling. What's wrong?
Not enough vodka in it.
Not enough vodka in it.
There's no vodka in it.
There's no vodka in it.
Aha! What'd I tell ya!
Aha! What'd I tell ya!
What? What did you tell me?
Got vodka in it now. Gotta give it a new name. Hey, listen, you thought it up, we'll name it after you. What's your name?
Brad.
Brad.
Brad is not a good name for a cocktail.
Brad is not a good name for a cocktail.
Hey! Y'know what they used to call me in high school?
Hey! Y'know what they used to call me in high school?
Brad?
Brad?
No, no, on the football field. They called me... ...The Smallville Flash.
No, no, on the football field. They called me... ...The Smallville Flash.
Hey, man, that's a great name for a cocktail!
Man, you don't never pass out, do ya?
Nope. Never.
Here I am, honey, and I'm all yours. Remember when you were Queen of the Prom? All the guys had to wait in line to get a dance. But now there's only one name on your dance card, sweet thing, and it's --
Brad Wilson.
Brad Wilson.
Hiya, Kent, long time no see. Not that you ever could. "See" I mean, Hahaha!
Hiya, sweet thing. Little guy's getting' hassled, huh? Kent, you still here?
I seem to be.
All the kid needs is a couple of pointers from the ol' champ here. Kent, I bet you didn't know I won the all-country bowling trophy two years in a row.
Uh, no, I didn't know that, Brad.
Uh, no, I didn't know that, Brad.
A natural athlete can play any sport. Any sport.
Say, Brad. I think he'll be better off doing it his way.
For a guy who was lucky to be water-boy on the high school team, you sure got a big mouth, Kent.
I just think Ricky would rather not get a bowling lesson in front of the other kids.
The kid needs a man to show him --
The kid needs a man to show him --
The kid will do fine on his own. Give it your best shot, Ricky!
Lana Lang. How great to see you.
Clark.
You look wonderful.
You always did. Can I give you a hand with that?
You shouldn't say that, you're the chairman -- ...uh, chairperson...
And here I am, just standing here. That's terrible. Thank you.
And here I am, just standing here. That's terrible. Thank you.
You're welcome...??
You're welcome...??
For reminding me, I mean. Can you follow me?
I can't Clark already asked me. Didn't you? He used to love this song. Didn't you? So he just said -- "Would you dance with me?"
Sure, Lana, I'd love to.
You'd be surprised how many offers I didn't get. Even Brad wouldn't stick around for this. It really isn't easy.
The streamers? They're no problem, you just pull on them and --
And three years after the Royal Wedding, the King abdicated. Isn't that terrible?
It sure is.
It sure is.
There must be a gallon of potato salad left over.
You know what's the problem?
Too much mayonnaise?
Too much mayonnaise?
Mayonnaise? Donald loved mayonnaise. Why would you think that was the problem.?
Mayonnaise? Donald loved mayonnaise. Why would you think that was the problem.?
I didn't --
I didn't --
No, the problem is -- Why do I stay in Smallville? Believe me, I've asked myself the same question. Do you know how lucky you are to live in Metropolis? The Big Apricot.
No, the problem is -- Why do I stay in Smallville? Believe me, I've asked myself the same question. Do you know how lucky you are to live in Metropolis? The Big Apricot.
But Lana, you could --
But Lana, you could --
That's easy to say. But how? And what about Ricky?
That's easy to say. But how? And what about Ricky?
Who?
Who?
Ricky. My little boy. At least here we've got a house. and I've got a job. Okay, I'm only a secretary, oaky, but it pays the bills. Except for last winter when the fuel bills kept going up and up and up. I even had to pawn my diamond ring then.
You...um...you never got married?
Oh...I came close once.
That song. I remember one day I came into the music room and you were fooling around at the piano. And I thought -- what am I going to do with all this potato salad?
You thought that?
You thought that?
I thought "Clark Kent has a really nice voice." You didn't even know I was there.
I just can't stand this.
Hey, he'll be all right. Believe me Lana, I know. I was a late bloomer myself.
Hey, he'll be all right. Believe me Lana, I know. I was a late bloomer myself.
It isn't only that he's small for his age. how would you like to be the only kid in town without a father? Look at him, he's stewed to the gills in the middle of the afternoon.
It isn't only that he's small for his age. how would you like to be the only kid in town without a father? Look at him, he's stewed to the gills in the middle of the afternoon.
But all he had was chocolate milk.
But all he had was chocolate milk.
I mean him.
Gee, I haven't done this in years.
Some people don't think it's healthy.
Some people don't think it's healthy.
Well, it's true you have to be careful things don't spoil, especially with mayonnaise or cream.
Well, it's true you have to be careful things don't spoil, especially with mayonnaise or cream.
Clark, I think you worry too much about mayonnaise.
Clark, I think you worry too much about mayonnaise.
Me??
Me??
I'm talking about salt. Oh, go ahead, pour it on, relax. That's what picnics are for.
And even nicer when there's a man around, Which isn't all that often.
There's a lot of choices here.
There's a lot of choices here.
No, all the good ones are married. That's why Brad thinks he's God's gift to women. This woman anyway. He's single. He won't take no for an answer, but he's the only one who's asking. And he knows it.
No, all the good ones are married. That's why Brad thinks he's God's gift to women. This woman anyway. He's single. He won't take no for an answer, but he's the only one who's asking. And he knows it.
I meant all the choices here. All this -- -- cole slaw, guacamole -- This is some picnic!
Peanut butter and jelly.
No, thanks.
No, thanks.
No, I mean Ricky. He's not interested in any of this stuff.
No, I mean Ricky. He's not interested in any of this stuff.
Well, this pate is rather...unusual.
Well, this pate is rather...unusual.
Pate? What pate? I didn't make any -- Oh, no, Clark. That's Buster's dog food.
Gee, I haven't laughed like that since -- since -- I really can't remember when.
Me neither...
So...how much longer do you think you'll be in Smallville --
You know, I was just thinking, Lana -- -- someone like you could do do really well in Metropolis --
I can never get a way from it.
Old ties are hard to cut.
Old ties are hard to cut.
No. I mean, yes they are, but I was talking about that. Wheat King. Bet your bottom dollar that's a Wheat King thresher.
That's the biggest change in Smallville, you know. They've taken over this town. Everybody who isn't actually working for Wheat King -- like I do -- is out there -- on a Wheat King thresher. Do you think I could do it? Do you?
Ride a thresher? Well, I don't know. Girls are trying just about everything now but --
Ride a thresher? Well, I don't know. Girls are trying just about everything now but --
No, what you said before, Could I make it in Metropolis? I've dreamed about it, sure, but I never really thought about it. What would I do when I got there?
No, what you said before, Could I make it in Metropolis? I've dreamed about it, sure, but I never really thought about it. What would I do when I got there?
Call me.
Call me.
Oh, I wouldn't want to -- I mean, I'd want to, but I wouldn't want to...be a nuisance to you.
The dog's always doing that. And the car's always doing that.
Can I help?
He really was!
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Well, aren't you excited?
Well, aren't you excited?
Lana, I'm from Metropolis. I see Superman every day.
Gee, I always loved porch swings.
Me too. That's why I put this one up.
No, well in this case I think I can speak for him. I mean, I'm pretty close to him, you know. Superman will be there on Wednesday.
Well, he's going to get the best home-cooked meal he's had in... in a long time. You tell Superman we think he's wonderful.
I guess he misses a lot of dinners.
But if you wouldn't mind settling for me --
But if you wouldn't mind settling for me --
Anyday...
Hi, Lois. Morning, Jimmy, you've got mustard on your lapel. Excuse me, Mr. White, I don't mean to interrupt but ---
Please, Kent, not now. I'm trying to put out a newspaper here.
Mr. White, please, I promised those people I'd get back to them by this morning. What do you think?
Look, I don't know, Kent. . . CLARK Personally, I think it could be a terrific story!
I'm getting a cramp in my elbow from this.
Let me do it for you, Mr. White.
-- but you deserve the vacation, Lois.
Oh. You're going away.
Uh...excuse me, folks...
Kent!
Kent!
I'm sorry, Mr. White, but I've got an errand to run.
Well... Not quite like this.
Mom and I do this all the time.
Mr. Kent! Superman was here!
What!
Do you really know Superman?
We get together sometimes.
Mr. Kent, could I ask you something?
Sure.
Sure.
Could you get me Superman's autograph?
Hi. Mister Kent. Guess who Mom's having dinner with tonight? Superman!
Actually, that's why I stopped by. He's realy sorry, he wanted to make it, but then he...ran into a problem.
Anyway, the reunion's just the hook for the story. What it's really about is how the typical small town's changed in the last fifteen years. how do you like this a title: Can You Go Home Again ?
Say!
Say!
Take me, for instance. Going back to middle America after having become a Metropolis sophisticate --
So, Mr. White? Can I go ahead and make my travel arrangements?
Exactly what I was about to ask about me.
You're the best, Lois.
I'd better be. Suddenly I've got competition to keep up with. Your high school reunion article. I though it was terrific. And fascinating. Especially about the girl back home. I'll tell you what, Clark, I'll take you to lunch and you can tell me all about it.

Gee, I'm sorry, Lois. But I've already got a lunch date. With Mr. White's new secretary.

But my Uncle Al, on my father's side, he won't eat her stuffing, he says it should be cooked on the outside of the turkey and she puts the stuffing inside the turkey. So my mother told my Aunt Ellen . . . Aunt Ellen's my father's half-sister, I told you that, right?
Mmmmm . . .

Actually, it's probably more like $143.80 and one-half cent. There's always fractions over in a big corporation, but they round it down to the lowest whole number.
What'm I gonna do with half a cent? Buy me a thoroughbred cockroach? Everybody loses them fractions?

Please, Mr. Webster, you're a great humanitarian. Ain't you heard what it's like in them jails? You send an innocent boy in and he gets thrown in with killers and robbers and rapers and raper killer and robber rapers and...
Mr. Gorman, just answer me one question...
You've been a naughty boy haven't you? C'mon now, admit it, you were kinda naughty.
Uh...yeah. I didn't think of it that way exactly, but...
Say, fella, I understand. I can -- what do the kids say these days -- "dig where you're comin' from." You want to be rich, right?
Uh...
Uh...
Now me, I was born rich. I've never worn the same pair of socks twice.
Now me, I was born rich. I've never worn the same pair of socks twice.
Yeah? What do you do with 'em?
I believe they're laundered and sent to some charitable institution. I don't know what the heck they do with 'em. Maybe they use them for dust rags, or pen wipers...
Or socks.

Gus, Webco, the Webster industrial complex, is a family-owned cartel. A little magnesium here, a little zinc there. Some railroads here, some farm machinery there. You follow?
I'm tryin' to.
Gus, do you know what I want now? I want coffee!
Black or regular?
Black or regular?
I don't think you understand.
Man, what is this?
Plants. Plants always make an office cozier.
Under different company names. I control the price of coffee beans in Brazil. The price in Venezuela. Java, South Korea, North Korea, the Aleutian Islands, Guam, Bolivia, and the Republic of Gabon!
Decaffeinated too?
But y'see, chum, the problem I got is that one country just won't play ball with me. You know how that can just bug a guy, don't you?
Which country?
Which country?
Columbia.
Columbia.
Columbia.
Columbia.
Columbia's got two major exports and one of them's coffee.
Wipe 'em out?
Destroy the entire Colombian coffee crop down to the last bean.
But Mr. Webster...you're doin' okay with Brazil and them other places. What's wrong with just one little old country doin' their own thing?
A very wise man once said...I think it was Attila the Hun... "It's not enough that I succeed. Everyone else must fail." And you are going to do it for me.

How do you do that?
Like everything else in the 20th century, Gus. You push buttons.
Always making yourself beautiful for me, aren't you? So, Gus, can you make Vulcan do what I want it to? You didn't answer me, pal. Did you hear about that prison riot last week? It seems they were complaining about rats in the cells...
Yeah, yeah, I can do it.

Huh?
Every oil tanker and super- tanker and super-duper-tanker in the ocean is controlled. totally, by computers. Computers to tell them where to go, how much oil to take on, where to deliver it.
They ain't got captains?
They ain't got captains?
Yes, but they don't really need them. it's just a throw- back to some sentimental sea- faring baloney.
And do nothing. Just sit there.
Then how's all the people gonna get their oil?
Then how's all the people gonna get their oil?
You catch on fast, old buddy. Tell him about the pumps. I know how you love the part about the pumps.
And then shut down the pipe lines.

Pumps stop pumping oil. Pipe lines stop pipin' oil. Tankers stop deliverin' oil. Man, this is high stakes.
Thanks, kiddo. now, listen, this part's important. I want you to program one special command into all these systems. Tell them these orders are irreversible, so it'll be impossible for anybody to switch them back. Can you do that, pal?
Lookit, you're getting' what you want all the time. it ain't right that I don't get somethin'! I never get somethin'!

Remember, Gus. A machine doesn't want anything except to keep on being a machine. You've got to make sure it can figure out how to beat any opponent.
Man, all it got to do is find their weak spot. You bet on the machine in any fight you name, you gonna win your bet.
You want to mess with Superman?
Can't wait, pal, can't wait.
Awright. I got me my electric train, mama. I finally got -- Hey, what y'all doin' up there?!

There is no handle! You just push a button.

Missing????
Embezzled, Mr. Webster. Stolen from the firm.
I don't know who. Whom. I can't trace it. In the old days it was simple. We kept books, we had ledgers, we could see what was going in and what was paid out. If somebody wanted to rob you, he'd come in with a gun and say 'stick 'em up." Now they get theses blasted computers to do their dirty work!
My friend, you are yesterday. Whoever pulled this caper is tomorrow.
Now, Vera...uh, Simpson, you know my Staff Dietician?
Hello.
Well, chum? What now? Kiss the 85 thou goodbye? Pay some thief's salary while he thinks up new ways to shake the money tree?
He's bound to slip up sooner or later.
That's what I want to know! By whom? Whom????
Get a hold of yourself, Vera. Nobody else ever will.
I don't kiss.
Oh, right. Well then, just shake hands.

He ruined it! That lousy do-gooder, he ruined it.
Don't cry, Bubba.
Nice try, Butch, but it wouldn't be effective against Superman. You'll see! Now that he's pulled this stunt, he'll stick his nose in my oil scheme and ruin that one, too! I've got to get rid of him! I've got to!
How? Shoot him? You know about him and bullets. Not to mention knives, tanks, bombs...
Wait a minute! She's right! Kryptonite. I remember reading about it in an interview with him. Nuts...
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
I just remembered the rest. There isn't any more. The only chunk that ever landed on Earth disappeared a couple of years ago. It was in this story in the Daily Planet.

So all we've got to do is pick up the garbage. We just have to find our where in Heaven Krypton used to be. Then good old Gus here contacts the Vulcan satellite--
Don't you see? Okay, so you didn't kill him. Nobody's perfect. But that stuff we ran up in the lab wasn't a complete failure after all. Right after Gus gave it to him, Superman started to turn into a selfish, ornery, malicious, conniving...

Do I detect a note of jealousy?
Lois, what are you doing?
When was the last time you heard me sneeze?

Oh, you're a great writer, Lois, nobody doubts that.
Yeah, thanks. . . . I mean, really! Posing as newlyweds to uncover the honeymoon racket in Niagara Falls. I mean,. imagine wasting a great reporter - -- uh, reporters -- on this. Perry White and his Sunday Magazine exposes.
But this should be exposed. They get kids here who are just starting out in life and they take them for every nickel they can get. That's what Perry says.
A "complimentary corsage."
Oh sure, everything is complimentary. Until you get the bill.
I was. . . uh. . . just wondering about the.. . .the.. . . the uh, arrangements. Sleeping arrangements.
Mr. Smith - -- the "complimentary couch."
I don't know, they look pretty happy to me...
That's because you can hardly see through those things.

Listen, I've got to give you credit. Your disguise is nearly perfect. I mean, if you fooled me, and I am nobody's fool --
No, of course not, Lois. You just get carried away sometimes. Believe me, I understand --
You've been under a lot of pressure lately -
Uh-uh. Listen, I'll tell you what. You say I'm wrong. And I say I'm right. So why don't we make a little bet on it?
Uh-uh. Listen, I'll tell you what. You say I'm wrong. And I say I'm right. So why don't we make a little bet on it?

Let's go to my place.

I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Me too, Oh, I tried to convince myself, believe me, "It's like being married to a doctor," I said. Doctors are practically never at home.

You no longer can serve humanity if you invest your time and emotion in one of them at the expense of the rest. Surely this is not how you repay their gratitude, Kal-El. Could you really abandon the weak and the needy merely to fulfill some selfish dream.

Then I remember how smashing I look in sable . . . oh, it's all so confusing. You think I'm silly, don't you?
No ... Metropolis is a confusing place. Back in Smallville -- my hometown -- everything was more simple. People would sacrifice everything just to lend a helping hand.
No ... Metropolis is a confusing place. Back in Smallville -- my hometown -- everything was more simple. People would sacrifice everything just to lend a helping hand.
That's not what we were taught. 'Look out for number one' -- that's daddy's golden rule ... he always ends up with the gold.
Oh . . . no, there's no one back home.
What about here?
What about here?
Well, my career takes up a lot of my time.

Don't tell me you're waiting for lightning to strike. Wide-eyed romantics are an endangered species.
Don't tell me you're waiting for lightning to strike. Wide-eyed romantics are an endangered species.
That sounds kind of pessimistic.
That sounds kind of pessimistic.
No, realistic. There's no magic in the world. Girls just don't get swept off their feet anymore.
I feel kind of light-headed . . .
Don't worry, I've got you.
Maybe I should sit this one out.
Don't give up. This is a perfect subject for your series on young Metropolis. Now let's get those knees up!
Now you try, Clark. We'll start you off with 60 pounds.
If you say so. Here goes.
He's a jerk. I never noticed it before. Seems like a lot of people I know are jerks . . . . . . Maybe you think the same thing about me. That's why you keep avoiding me.
I'm not avoiding you. I've been very busy and . . . I like you . . . I really do.
Then prove it. Lois is doing an interview with Superman about his peace mission . . .
Yes, I know. I'm sure it will be a great story.
Yes, I know. I'm sure it will be a great story.
I'll just invite them both to my hotel suite and we'll have high tea. It's very chic.
Gee, I don't think . . .
Come early. The view is so romantic from my balcony.
Hello, Lacy. Can anybody break a twenty? The cabbie didn't have any change.
. . . Let me get my purse.
Shouldn't you pay the cabbie?
Oh . . . Right. . . I'll be back in a flash.
I missed you. It wasn't any fun up there with just Lois and Superman. They're so boring. Let's go do something wild!
But they're expecting us. It wouldn't be polite.
Oh . . . my . . .
Clark. . . !
Hi. Is dinner ready? I'm famished.
Let's sit down. They walk to the table. LOIS calls out to the balcony.
Gee, I'm really sorry.
No mind, it's only antique Irish linen.
Daddy's offered me jobs at some of his other companies. But, I've been thinking maybe I'll take some time off. I'm going to find a place like Smallville, in the country. Maybe a farm . . . see what the slow lane is like.
I'm sorry to see you go.
I'm sorry to see you go.
You don't have to be polite, Clark. I've got a pretty good idea of how you feel about me.
You don't have to be polite, Clark. I've got a pretty good idea of how you feel about me.
I'm not so sure you do.
I'm not so sure you do.
Any more like you back home, Clark?
Any more like you back home, Clark?
Like me?
Like me?
You know: strong, gentle, tall men with bright blue eyes and square. Men who like to dance slow, the old fashioned way, the way their mothers taught them on the night before their prom.
You'll find a good man Lacy. You deserve one.
Maybe if you'd have met who I am now, instead of the spoiled brat you met a few weeks ago, it would have been different between us.

Regardez. Voila Monsieur David Warfield.
That tycoon who owns all those sleazy tabloids?
That tycoon who owns all those sleazy tabloids?
Au contraire, mon ami! He owns all those sleazy tabloids and the Daily Planet!
No Paris?
I don't think we're being treated fairly, Lois. And I'm going to tell Miss Warfield.
I don't think we're being treated fairly, Lois. And I'm going to tell Miss Warfield.
Clark . . . wait!
The President is about to speak. I don't think it's going to be good news.
You always overreact, Clark. How terrible can it be?
Oh, probably just a picture request. I'll take care of it if you want, Lois.
I don't think 'fan mail' fits this letter. Read it, Clark.
'Are you or are you not part of a plot to weaken our national defense?'
It's her father's grey matter that's weakened if you ask me. How can I ask Superman such a dumb question.
It's her father's grey matter that's weakened if you ask me. How can I ask Superman such a dumb question.
Politely?
. . . Please leave your message at the beep.
Clark, it's Lois. This is the fourth message. I've left. . . Where are you ?
It's just a bad flu, really. How did you know . . .
You haven't been at work . . . you didn't call the office . . . you didn't even call me. How could you not call back?
Superman? Has something happened to him?
Everyone's saying he's . . . dead. But I know that isn't true. I feel it in my heart. I think he just needs help.
Everyone's saying he's . . . dead. But I know that isn't true. I feel it in my heart. I think he just needs help.
You know him so well. But I'm sure he'll manage . . . wherever he is.
It must have been a super effort to get out of bed, Clark.
Well, I'm feeling a lot better . . . almost chipper . . . . . . and all because I had a visit from a very good nurse.
Close the curtains. The sun is hurting my eyes.
Of course it is. Do you know what the sun is? Why it's just one huge nuclear bomb. A bomb with enough radiation to incinerate an average man like . . . that.
Of course it is. Do you know what the sun is? Why it's just one huge nuclear bomb. A bomb with enough radiation to incinerate an average man like . . . that.
But Superman isn't an average man.
But Superman isn't an average man.
And what am I? A Shriner? No, If you'll join forces with me, together we can make the world safe for war profits again.
Boys, old Lex has a secret recipe in this dish . . . call it a genetic stew. You help me place it on one of your missiles and I promise you . . . if Superman throws it into the sun, he'll get the biggest surprise of his life. I'll be able to introduce Superman to his first nightmare . . . a
And this so-called . . . Nuclear Man. . . of yours can defeat Superman?
And this so-called . . . Nuclear Man. . . of yours can defeat Superman?
Do people die in Italian Operas? Gentlemen, if all goes to plan Nuclear Man will return from the sun with power awesome enough to do what none before him has ever been able to . . . pierce Superman's skin. He'll be mortal, he'll get sick . . . and we'll dance on his grave.
And what do we get out of it?
If my plan works, gentlemen, I'll just take a tiny commission . . . something . . .appropriate. . . a number with a lot of zeros after it.
Lex, we all appreciate how you've supported us lately and . . . uh . . . in recognition of your hard work we've decided to increase your commission to 12 percent.
Gee guys, that's swell of you. But . . . I've got another idea.
Impossible? Why?
Because I made a vow. Never to interfere in the destiny of your planet.
Because I made a vow. Never to interfere in the destiny of your planet.
But what good is a vow if everything gets blown away? What good was my letter?
But what good is a vow if everything gets blown away? What good was my letter?
I'm going to pass this letter on to all the leaders of the world. I promise you. For it is they , and not I, that represent the people of Earth.
Well, I don't understand.
I'm sorry.
Would you mind taking a walk with me?
Absolutely!
Would you mind waiting for me in the visitor's gallery?
N-no...I mean...you bet.
Awesome!
Jeremy, I need you to tell the people of the world what you see.
Jeremy, I need you to tell the people of the world what you see.
I'll try. . .
Well . . . I see the ocean currents. . . and the rain . . . and mountains and rivers. . . but . . .
Go on . . .
Go on . . .
But you can't tell where one country begins and another ends. You can't see any borders. It's just . . . one world.
But you can't tell where one country begins and another ends. You can't see any borders. It's just . . . one world.
Good. If you can see it, and I can see it, maybe some day everyone will see it.
Not so fast! All trips are canceled. We pay for wire services. And what we don't get from them, we'll invent.
Mr. White, come with me I want to see
Who does Clark Kent think he is anyway! He never even said good night!
Clark Kent! You socialized with him . . . a . . . reporter!
Clark Kent! You socialized with him . . . a . . . reporter!
Oh . . . no . . . I mean, we just went dancing . . . for a story . . .
Oh . . . no . . . I mean, we just went dancing . . . for a story . . .
Your grandfather had one iron rule that's stood me well. Never fraternize with the help. Keep too your own station. Am I clear?
Darling, it's good riddance. Let her go. And while you're at it, fire that Clark Kent. He hasn't been here in days. He hasn't even called.
I know Daddy. I'm worried about him.
I know Daddy. I'm worried about him.
Didn't we have our little talk about personal involvement with the help? Now that you're the publisher . . .
Didn't we have our little talk about personal involvement with the help? Now that you're the publisher . . .
Daddy . . . ?
Daddy . . . ?
Yes, darling?
Yes, darling?
Stuff it.
Tone down our headlines? Lacy, that's all the common man reads!
I'd just like to have a little less sensationalism.
I'd just like to have a little less sensationalism.
Less sensational papers go broke. I thought I taught you long ago the business of newspapers is business.
No, Daddy. Our business is journalism. We can't continue to be so irresponsible . . . or else we'll just lead everyone into a disaster.
Don't be over-dramatic, young lady. What kind of disaster could we help bring about?
Is he for real?
One hundred percent. And I like him that way.
I think he's kind of cute.
Forget it, Princess. Clark is the world's oldest boy scout Trustworthy, loyal, obedient, helpful... and I don't remember the rest, but he's them too. And I promise, he's not interested in anyone like you.
But all men like me, Lois. I'm very rich.
. . . And very naïve!
This letter was addressed to Superman care of me.
Superman gets mail here?
I think there's an angle.
An angle?
An angle?
Daddy loves to whip up campaigns! People eat it up. We'll make this kid a celebrity. The whole world will be waiting for Superman's answer.
I know I'm not exactly a Girl Scout but . . . maybe if I show him I'm trying . . . he'll like me.
Who?
Who?
Clark. He's late again. I can't figure him out.
Clark. He's late again. I can't figure him out.
That's because there's nothing to figure out. Now will you please pay attention. I'm not through insulting your father.
That's because there's nothing to figure out. Now will you please pay attention. I'm not through insulting your father.
Lois, have you ever fallen for a guy and he's not like other guys . . . he's different. It's like you come from two different worlds.
And your heart beats faster just thinking about him.
Right . . . you want to tell him how you feel . . .
Right . . . you want to tell him how you feel . . .
But he's never there.
But he's never there.
Why, Lois, I didn't know . . . Who is he?
What's he going to say?
Something . . . wonderful.
What's that?
Our other dinner guest.
Where's Clark?
He was getting on . . . and then this man with luggage and . . . oh, it's a long story.
He was getting on . . . and then this man with luggage and . . . oh, it's a long story.
It always is with Clark.
Are we going to skip the country, Uncle Lex?
Lenny, ,you pathetic product of the public school system. Your Uncle Lex has had only one thing on his awesome mind during his incarceration . . . Destroying Superman!
Do you realize what I can create with a single strand of Superman's hair!
A toupee that flies?
A toupee that flies?
. . . I look at you, Lenny, and I know how the Romans felt when the barbarians arrived at their city gate.
. . . I look at you, Lenny, and I know how the Romans felt when the barbarians arrived at their city gate.
But why the hair?
But why the hair?
That hair contains a sample of Superman's genetic material. The building blocks of his body. With my genius and enough nuclear power to mutate those genes, I will create a being with all his powers . . . but with absolute allegiance to me!
He missed the door, Uncle Lex.
Quiet! You'll make him self-conscious.
Whoa. . .
He has all of Superman's powers. If I've planned it right. . .
Gee, Uncle Lex, I don't think this guy's much of a dancer.
Let's try to keep your I.Q. a family secret, Leonard. Before we launch him against Superman, we have to test him ... see how well he does with mayhem and destruction. Kind of a coming out party under the glare of media covering the Metro Club gala. And once he proves himself, then . . .
Superman broke your monster, Uncle Lex.
I must have miscalculated. How. . .
Gee, Uncle Lex, I was just getting to the good part.
Get the box, nephew.
Hey, Uncle Lex, how's the Nuclear Guy goin' to find his way here?
Oh Leonard . . . When I sent the remains of my last experiment . . .
Oh Leonard . . . When I sent the remains of my last experiment . . .
The one Superman wrecked up?
The one Superman wrecked up?
Not how I might have put it, but, correct. The remains I sent to the sun included the creatures genetic memory. He'll remember everything that he experienced. Not to worry. He'll find his way back to me. Did you hear that?

You're spookin' me out, Uncle Lex.
You're spookin' me out, Uncle Lex.
There!
Hey! He looks . . . normal.
He's . . . beautiful. Perfect.
Hey! Just remember I made you.
You're just an experiment, freako!
What was that about?
Didn't you see it? He lifted me up and crashed me down.
Didn't you see it? He lifted me up and crashed me down.
Hmm . . . Nuclear levitation. Now that's a trick that could come in handy.
He's . . . cold. . .
Good. Let's hope he stays that way.
Of course! That's his one vulnerability. The one way he can be stopped.
What?
Boy, are you gonna get it.
My nephew, Leonard. He worships me. Let's share a toast to you . . . a nice guy who's about to finish last.
We'll all fry.
This wasn't in the plan.
This wasn't in the plan.
I think he has his own plan, Uncle Lex.
Don't worry honey, I'm sure he'll make a swell husband.
Ready, Uncle Lex?
Ready, Uncle Lex?
If you need us we'll, be five hundred feet underground waiting for the Nuclear winter to turn to nuclear spring.
You think he'll find us.
Never. But we have to hide out for a while. Lay low. Say. . . a couple of years. By then I'll have a new plan.
Never. But we have to hide out for a while. Lay low. Say. . . a couple of years. By then I'll have a new plan.
Lucky I brought my drums.
What I need this for?
For dignity. My reputation is at stake. Just put it on.
I hadn't counted on this but . . . . . . of course - the power of the sun has given him internally generated heat. I am a ...
You are . . .
You are . . .
What? A genius? . . . an inspiration?
What? A genius? . . . an inspiration?
You are . . . nothing. I am father now.
I am an experiment? I am freako?
I made you, and I can destroy you.
Destroy Superman!
Wait! Not yet! Back!
Nifty, huh? Goodnight Sweet Prince, parting is . . . inevitable Now, destroy Superman.
First, I have fun.
Nice bit. You're good. With my brain and your, well, frankly, brawn, the possibilities are staggering. I could be . . . Emperor, King! Did you see how scared those guys were?
What do you fear?
What do you fear?
Me? Now? With Superman dead and you on my team? It's like I'm the coach and you're the best power forward ever. What could I have to fear?
Me? Now? With Superman dead and you on my team? It's like I'm the coach and you're the best power forward ever. What could I have to fear?
Destiny.
Stop! I command you . . . you mutant!
I am master now.
Guess who? It's your old friend, Lex.
Luthor, I suspect if you had actually planted a bomb you'd be far away from here by now.
Luthor, I suspect if you had actually planted a bomb you'd be far away from here by now.
Silly me. How do I ever think I can fool the super guy. You're right, no bomb. I just knew you were too busy with the world peace bit to make a social call. I confess . . . I tricked you. Hey, you look great!
If you have any social skills, you've learned them from a rattlesnake. Just what are you up to?
Know something? You're a workaholic. A good guy 24 hours a day. Stop and smell the roses sometime. Take up a hobby. Get a pet . . . a kitten or a puppy. . .

It's common knowledge you hate children and animals. Why are you back in Metropolis?
It's common knowledge you hate children and animals. Why are you back in Metropolis?
Why? Because I want to be the first one to introduce you to a new kid on the block.
Look closely at his cell structure. See anything familiar?
You've broken all the laws of man, Luthor. And now you've broken the laws of nature! . . . I assume you must have hidden a device in one of the missiles I hurled into the sun!
Your time in prison has twisted you into a delusionary state, Luthor.
No, no, listen. I escaped with only one thing on my mind . . . the end of Superman.
I'm not going anywhere.
I'll ignore that . . . So, I created a monster who didn't work nearly as well as I might have liked -- you were clearly his better -- he needed more energy, more power.

Which explains why you sent his organic matter to the sun.

Precisely. And then it came to me. My greatest ever plan. I made a deal with some minor league Bad Boys. Arms Dealers, Renegades Generals, You know the type. With you gone, we'll make a fortune rearming the world.

A mind is a terrible thing to waste, Lex Luthor. And you've wasted yours on this foul monstrosity. I'm taking you in.
Superman. . . But you're... dead!
Still having delusions, Lex Luthor?
I'll deal with you later.
Right, good. Tell you what, we'll wait right here. Till you get back.
But . . . how could you beat him?
High School Physics, Luthor. While I was recuperating I had time to figure out that if your foul creature was born from the sun, it must have been his source of energy.
But . . . but isn't the world about to be osterized?
No . . . it's the way it always is . . . on the brink . . . with good fighting evil.
I know, but --
Stop saying you know when I say 'y'know.' I know you know. Yes, I know you're here, Otis. What do you want, a brass band?
You'll be designing monuments soon, Albert! Hotels! Palaces!
Bunkers!
Bunkers!
I take the man out of Argentina - and it was no picnic finding him y'know? And what does he think about? Bunkers. Still living in the past, when I am about to realize the greatest real estate scheme in the history of the world!
There's some slice American cheese...and...a half a bottle of club soda, I think.
Wonderful. Otis will go above and steal some Big Macs.
Ahhhh, my favorite part of the day. Who else could have thought of this aquarium?
Nobody else.
Nobody else.
Shut up, apple-polisher.
That the planet blew up on May 23, 1937. That the rocket ship with the revolting little freak in it took three years to reach Earth. Ergo?
He's thirty-five years old.

You're a great architect, Albert.
You're a great architect, Albert.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Otherwise, you're a Mongoloid idiot. It's reasonable to assume that fragments of the planet were shot out into space by the force of the explosion, and --
Ah! The guest of honor at last! And about time, too!
We're running out of smoke.
But Mr. Luthor, sir, I already --
And stop interrupting. his is the big scene. Your finest hour! You rose to the challenge, baby! And you lost. That's the best part!
It's very simple, Otis. Very simple, the XK101 rocket. It's nothing, forty years ago we in the Fatherland were working on this. Five more years, we would've had it. But then -- -- that silly war...Why, my cousin Werner had already --
Albert!
Albert!
-- thought about a rocket that carries a nuclear warhead in its nosecone and can strike with an impact of --
Yes, so, well, Werner would've gotten to that too but -- -- but the XK101 flies only eight feet above the ground...well below the radar limit! So what? We could have done that soon. We had ways to make people ta-- ways to avoid the radar. And this XK101 -- they think it's so smart that they keep it in 'missile silos' underground. Hah!
One of them should've been you.
One of them should've been you.
Yes, Mr. Luthor. The XK101 can travel anywhere in the world undetected. It also has a sensory device built into it so that it can detect any obstacle in its path and avoid it. It just goes around it or over it. The XK101 never quits! It will not stop until it reaches its pre-targeted target!

No, Mom. You know I wouldn't break my promise.
No, Mom. You know I wouldn't break my promise.
I know you're a good boy, Clark. No mother could ask for better. It's just that...
Don't worry, Mom. I know.
Anyway, we Kent's don't like showoffs, ain't that so? A body's got to be humble even if he knows that he's better'n his neighbors.
Mom...
I know.
I talked to Ben Hubbard this morning. He'll be more than glad to bring in the crops on shares.
He's a good man, Ben is. Your father always said so.
Mother...

Do you know where you're headed?
North. It's north
Keep warm now.
I will.
I'd like to.
Well!
I'll bet you have some good ideas.
Hey, you're getting a better class of people in your office these days, Boss.

Hey!
What the -- !
Stop him, Clark!
He may have a gun!
He may have a gun!
Oh, for God's sake!
It isn't worth getting a heart attack over, Lois.
You're great with the advice, Clark. Maybe you'd better take over the lovelorn column.

For what? Oh, I've see the way the other half lives. My sister, for instance. it looks terrific, but is that what I really want? Three kids, two cats, and fifteen needlepoint pillows? I'd go bananas after one week. Hell, I need this crazy existence of mine. Like I need the plague, right? That's what your thinking.
No. I'm just thinking that you smoke too much, if you don't mind my saying so.
No. I'm just thinking that you smoke too much, if you don't mind my saying so.

Yes, true. But on other worlds there would be other problems - heat, cold, no life, no life support systems...No, Lara, believe me; Earth is the least of evils. On Earth, his lighter gravity will render him almost weightless - that can't be helped. But with his denser molecular structure, he will also be strong. He will be fast, He will be virtually invulnerable.

It's just that -- I spent a fortune on these things! And all for naught! What a waste --
Of time, Luthor.
Of time, Luthor.
Right, right. Where was I? Ah, yes --
At the San Andreas Fault. Maybe you've heard of it.
Sure. It's the joining together of two land masses pushed together eight million years ago. The fault line itself is unstable and always shifting, which is the reason you get earthquakes in the California area from time to time.

Couldn't have said it better myself. Now all this -- -- west of the Fault is the most expensive real estate in the world. Los Angeles. San Diego. San Francisco. And here -- -- is just hundreds and hundreds of miles of cheap desert land. Land that happens to be owned by Lex Luthor Enterprises. Well... ...call me a fool, but ...it did occur
Nice! Most of California would have been destroyed. Millions of people would've been killed! The West Coast as we know it would have --
-- Dropped into the sea! Bye-bye California! Hello, new West Coast! Gold Coast! My Coast. And now...well... I left my heart in San Francisco...
It would never have worked, Luthor. You are a dreamer -- a sick, twisted dreamer.
Maybe I should get help.
Maybe I should get help.
It wouldn't hurt. You can't go on living in fantasies. Did you really think you could get hold of a nuclear bomb? And drop it? Why, our Strategic Defense boys would have --

You're right, you're right, Superman. There were wrinkles to iron out. But, well... ...there is this new rocket, the XK 101.
You're right, you're right, Superman. There were wrinkles to iron out. But, well... ...there is this new rocket, the XK 101.
The XK 101. Luthor, that operates on radio waves. And with our fail-safe system, only the President himself can push that button.

I know. I know. I never promised myself a rose garden.
Still, foolishly, perhaps, I had a theory that eliminates the Presidential push-button. I was doing my homework...
On radio waves?
On radio waves?
And garbage doors.
Luthor --
You guessed it! You're always one step ahead of me. Aren't you Superman? Yes, right. There was a police helicopter buzzing the area and transmitting on the same frequency as the garage doors. The minute the signal went out -- Zip! Zip! Zip!
Well, that's their problem, T.S. But -- but the XK 101 also works on a radio wave control system. The problem was to find out the frequency. Problems, problems, I've had so many...
They'll soon be over.
They'll soon be over.
In a way -- oh, it'll be a relief. I'm a wreck. No rest for the wicked, y'know. It wasn't enough, the radio frequencies, then I had to worry about getting to the missile and adjusting the aiming. So that if I could have activated the launch -- well, Lex Luthor would've hit the spot. There's a little place on Route 190. Dead on
Well, it's very impressive but you built this junk for nothing.
For the first time today, Superman I must tell you that you're wrong. But how could you know that - Oh, well. I guess I could tell you now. Y'see, actually...but this conversation is becoming rather dry, isn't it.
Now who's the dreamer, Superman? Even you can't fly that fast!
We'll see how fast I can fly.
Yes, we do know each other. I'm Alison Jones.
Alison Jones.
Yes.
Ally. That was my nickname.
Ally. That was my nickname.
Ally. That's right.
Ally. That's right.
How are you?
How are you?
I'm just fine, Ally. What about you?
I'm just fine, Ally. What about you?
I'm fine. Still working with my father.
I'm fine. Still working with my father.
And what does he do again?
And what does he do again?
He used to work with you. Until you found out he was having an affair with your wife.
Ally Jones.
How is Mrs. Stephens?
How is Mrs. Stephens?
We're...not together.
We're...not together.
I'd heard that. But she's well?
I'd heard that. But she's well?
Yes...fine.
Yes...fine.
And Zoe? How's Zoe?
I'm glad to hear that Zoe's okay.
Are you still in touch?
Are you still in touch?
Not really. The last time I saw her was at that clinic. That was a long time ago.

I don't remember the name. It was near a beach.

Sunnyridge. That was a long time
So there were others?
Other clinics? Oh sure. Clinics, half-way houses, treatment centers, detox units...

Then...when did she get better?
Then...when did she get better?
She didn't.
She didn't.
But you said...
But you said...
That's where I'm going. To see her.
That's where I'm going. To see her.
She's in trouble?
She's in trouble?
Yes. Do you find there's something strange about this meat?
What...does it turn to?
It turns to steaming piss.
I'm...so sorry.
That's okay.
I...don't think so.
I woke to the sound of Zoe's breathing. It was laboured. I looked over and noticed she was sweating and all swollen. I grabbed her, rushed to the kitchen, and splashed water on her face.

What happened?
What happened?
I didn't know. I was in a panic. I guessed she'd been bitten by an insect, but there was no doctor. The nearest hospital was forty miles away, and Zoe was continuing to swell. Klara took her in her arms and tried to breast-feed her, while I dialed the hospital. I finally got a doctor on the line. He sounded young, but cool. He
What happened?
Nothing. We made it to the hospital. I didn't have to go as far as I was prepared to. But I was prepared to go all the way.
Well, it was nice meeting you again, Mr. Stephens.
Mitchell. It was nice to see you again, Ally.
Mitchell. It was nice to see you again, Ally.
Alison.
Alison.
Alison.
Alison.
Say hi to Zoe.
Say hi to Zoe.
I will.
I will.
I hope she gets better.
I hope she gets better.
I'll tell her that.
My name is...
Mister, I don't want to know your name.
Mister, I don't want to know your name.
I understand.
I understand.
No you don't.
I can help you.
Not unless you can raise the dead.
Mr. Mitchell Stephens, Esquire, would you be likely to sue me if I was to beat you right now? Beat you so bad that you pissed blood and couldn't walk for a month. Because that's what I'm about to do.
No, Mr. Ansel. I wouldn't sue you.
No, Mr. Ansel. I wouldn't sue you.
Leave us alone, Stephens. Leave the people of this town alone. You can't help.
Leave us alone, Stephens. Leave the people of this town alone. You can't help.
You can help each other. Several people have agreed to let me represent them in a negligence suit. Your case as an individual will be stronger if I'm allowed to represent you together as a group.

Case?
Case?
The Walkers have agreed. The Ottos. Nicole Burnell's parents. It's important to initiate proceedings right away. Things get covered up. People lie. That's why we have to begin our investigation quickly. Before the evidence disappears. That's why I'm out here tonight.

I know Risa and Wendell Walker. They wouldn't hire a goddamned lawyer. And the Ottos wouldn't deal
That's my daughter. Or it may be the police to tell me that they've found her dead. She's a drug addict.
Why are you telling me this?
Why are you telling me this?
I'm telling you this because... we've all lost our children, Mr. Ansel.

Hi, Nicole.
Hi, Mr. Ansel. Hi, Jessica, Mason...
Hi, Mr. Ansel. Hi, Jessica, Mason...
They just finished supper.
They just finished supper.
Was it good?
I'll be back around nine.
Okay.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
Yeah.
It just seems...kind of weird.
It just seems...kind of weird.
Why?
Why?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Nicole, I'm just going to pack all this stuff and give it to the church for charity. Don't feel bad. Unless you feel strange about wearing it.
Nicole, I'm just going to pack all this stuff and give it to the church for charity. Don't feel bad. Unless you feel strange about wearing it.
No. I mean, I remember Mrs. Ansel wearing some of this stuff, but...I don't feel funny about that. I really liked her.
No. I mean, I remember Mrs. Ansel wearing some of this stuff, but...I don't feel funny about that. I really liked her.
And she really liked you. She would've given you all this if she'd outgrown it, or...
What do you mean 'outgrown it'?
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure.
Oh. Right.
Goodnight, Mr. Ansel.
Goodnight, Nicole.
Why would he do that? You didn't have anything to do with the accident.
Because I was driving behind the bus, Mary. Because I saw it. I saw it happen...
I used to like it here. I used to care about what happened. Now I think I'll sell my house and move the fuck away.
Billy, please. The children.
Billy, please. The children.
The children.
How is Nicole? Is she around?
She's resting. In her room.
She's resting. In her room.
Say hello for me.
So what brings you out tonight?
Well, Sam, I might as well tell you the truth. It's this lawsuit you've gotten yourself all involved with. I want you to drop the damned thing.
I don't see how that concerns you, Billy.
It does concern me.
It does concern me.
Well, I don't know why it should. There's a whole lot of people in town involved with lawsuits. We're hardly unique here, Billy. I mean, I can understand how you feel.
Well, I don't know why it should. There's a whole lot of people in town involved with lawsuits. We're hardly unique here, Billy. I mean, I can understand how you feel.
How?
Well, it being so depressing and all. But it's reality. You can't just turn this off because you happen to think it's a bad idea.
Why not?
Why not?
Because it's what we have to do.
Because it's what we have to do.
Well I don't want a damned thing to do with it.
Well I don't want a damned thing to do with it.
Okay, fine. So...stay out of it.
I've tried to stay out of it. But it turns out that's not so easy, Sam. You've gone and got yourself this lawyer. Mitchell Stephens. You and Risa and Wendell and the Ottos.
So? I mean, lot's of folks have got lawyers.
So? I mean, lot's of folks have got lawyers.
But yours is the one who's going to subpoena me, Sam. Force me to testify in court. He came by the garage this afternoon. Gave me this piece of paper.
If that bastard does subpoena me, if he forces me to go over this again, then all those other lawyers will line up behind him and try and do the same thing.
That won't happen, Billy. Mitch Stephens' case is small, compared to some of those other guys. The way he told me, all he needs is for you to say what you saw that day, driving behind the bus. I know it's a painful thing to do, but it'll only take a few minutes of your time. That'll be the end of it.

That's wrong, Sam. You know that. We'll be tangled up in this thing for the next five years. This is never going to go away...
That's wrong, Sam. You know that. We'll be tangled up in this thing for the next five years. This is never going to go away...
C'mon, you know that won't...
C'mon, you know that won't...
We've got lawyers suing lawyers because some people were stupid enough to sign on with more than one of the bastards. We've got people pointing fingers, making side deals, and dickering over percentages. Yesterday, I heard somebody wants to sue the rescue squad. The rescue squad. Because they didn't act fast enough.
No, Billy. We can't drop the lawsuit. You know how much we need the money.
Why? You got money from Dolores' insurance with the school board. We all did.
Why? You got money from Dolores' insurance with the school board. We all did.
It's not enough. For hospital bills. For Nicole.
It's not enough. For hospital bills. For Nicole.
I'll help pay for Nicole, if that's what you're really talking about. I'll even give you the money I got for my kids. That's what we used to do, remember? Help each other. This was a community.

I'm sorry.
Nicole's coming over to look after the kids tonight. She'll be there around six.
Billy, that's too early.
Billy, that's too early.
She said she's got to be home by nine.
She said she's got to be home by nine.
Can't you make it later?
Have you been waiting long?
A while.
A while.
Billy, do you have to smoke? Wendell can smell if someone's been smoking.
Does this mean I can't take a shower?
No. It should be dry by now.
What time's he coming home?
When the game's over, I guess.
What are you thinking?
Tomorrow I'm going to put Sean on the bus. He won't want to go. He never does. He'll cry and want to hold on to me.
Tomorrow I'm going to put Sean on the bus. He won't want to go. He never does. He'll cry and want to hold on to me.
That's because he misses you.
Yes.
It's natural.
It's natural.
Your kids never cry.
Your kids never cry.
Well, maybe that's because they know I'm going to follow them. Behind the bus.
Well, maybe that's because they know I'm going to follow them. Behind the bus.
They can look forward to that.
They can look forward to that.
Sure.
Sure.
Just like we look forward to this.
You're leaving.
I better get back.
Good night, Billy.
Good night.
I stopped by the station a while ago. I stared at the bus. I could almost hear the kids inside. There was a lawyer there. He told me he'd gotten you signed up. Is that true?
Something made this happen, Billy. Mr. Stephens is going to find out what it was.
Mr. Stephens says that someone didn't put a right bolt in the bus...
Risa, I serviced that bus. At the garage. There's nothing wrong with it.
Risa, I serviced that bus. At the garage. There's nothing wrong with it.
...or that the guardrail wasn't strong enough.
...or that the guardrail wasn't strong enough.
You believe that?
You believe that?
I have to.
I have to.
Why?
Why?
Because I have to.
Because I have to.
Well I don't.
Is it true that you gave Nicole one of Lydia's dresses? That she was wearing it when the bus crashed?
Yes.
Yes.
Why did you do that, Billy?
Why did you do that, Billy?
You think that caused the accident, Risa? That it brought bad luck? Christ, it sounds to me you're looking for a witch doctor, not a lawyer. Or maybe they're the same thing.
Dolores. No one calls me 'Mrs. Driscoll'.
What do you mean by that, Dolores?
What do you mean by that, Dolores?
About the Ottos?
About the Ottos?
Yes. What do you mean by 'hippies'?
I mean, the way they look. Their hair and clothing...
Do they have any reputation for drugs?
Do they have any reputation for drugs?
No, nothing like that. The Ottos are what I'd call model citizens. They're regular at town meetings. They give their opinions in a respectful way. They always help out at various fund-raising bazaars in town , though they aren't church goers.
No, nothing like that. The Ottos are what I'd call model citizens. They're regular at town meetings. They give their opinions in a respectful way. They always help out at various fund-raising bazaars in town , though they aren't church goers.
And they loved Bear.
And they loved Bear.
Oh yes. Like I said, they always came out together to see him off to school. It's like he was their little treasure. He was such a beautiful boy. That's a picture of him on the wall there, behind Abbott.
Those are all from the fair last year. Abbott and me were judges at the pet show.
For rabbits?
For rabbits?

Billy loved to see his kids in the bus. They always sat in the back, so they could wave to each other. It comforted him.
From what?
From what?
From what?
From what?
Did he have any particular problems that you knew of? Financial pressures...run-ins with the law...
Did he have any particular problems that you knew of? Financial pressures...run-ins with the law...
No, nothing like that. Billy's wife, Lydia, died of cancer a few years ago. He took over raising the children by himself. It was obvious how much he missed Lydia.
No, nothing like that. Billy's wife, Lydia, died of cancer a few years ago. He took over raising the children by himself. It was obvious how much he missed Lydia.
You talked about it?
You talked about it?
No. I saw it on his face.
That's the way I thought of them sometimes.
Berries.
Berries.
Yes. Like I was putting them into my big basket. Clearing the hillside of its children.
Abbott and I used to do a lot of that in the spring.
Berry-picking.
Berry-picking.
Yes. The old-fashioned way.
Yes. The old-fashioned way.
And what's that?
And what's that?
With our hands.
A strange little fellow, but you couldn't help liking him. He was close to ten but seemed more like a frightened five or six.
Were his parents...attentive to him?
Were his parents...attentive to him?
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
You mentioned that he had a learning disability.
You mentioned that he had a learning disability.
That's right.
That's right.
Did his parents attend to that?

What do you mean?
What do you mean?
Did they give him special care?
Did they give him special care?
The Walkers loved Sean. He was their only child...the object of all their attention. I mean, Wendell's a withdrawn sort of man. That's his nature. But Risa, she's still got dreams.
I have a question for you, Mr. Stephens.
What's that, Dolores?
I told you that I was doing fifty miles an hour when the accident happened. That's how I remembered it. But the truth is, I might have been doing sixty. Or sixty five. And if that's true, that I was over the limit when the bus went over, what would happen then?
That would complicate things.
That would complicate things.
Because I'd be to blame, right?
Because I'd be to blame, right?
Billy Ansel will insist that you were driving fifty-one miles an hour. Just like you've done every morning for the past fifteen years.
Billy Ansel will insist that you were driving fifty-one miles an hour. Just like you've done every morning for the past fifteen years.
He knows that? Billy?
He knows that? Billy?
Yes. He does.
Yes. He does.
Billy said that?
You've talked to Billy?
I did.
I did.
And Billy told you that he'll tell that to...
And Billy told you that he'll tell that to...
Mrs. Driscoll, if Billy Ansel does not volunteer to say so in court, I will subpoena him and oblige him to testify to that effect.
It's clear to me and other people that you have suffered significantly from this event.
What other people?
What other people?
Excuse me?
Excuse me?
Who's been talking to you about what I'm feeling? Who should care about what I'm feeling?
You heard what Abbott said?
Yes.
Yes.
Anything you didn't understand?
Anything you didn't understand?
There might have been a word or two that slipped by. Maybe you could clarify it for me, just to be absolutely sure.
That's what he said, is it?
Yes. Abbot understands these things.
He never took his eyes off his mother, even as he moved to sit beside Nicole. He looked frightened.
Why would he be frightened?
Why would he be frightened?
I don't know. But it was weird in terms of what happened next. Sean was still watching his mother.
Good morning, Wanda. Hi, Hartley.
Hi, Dolores.
What do you think?
Well, it's certainly what you'd call interesting.
Well, it's certainly what you'd call interesting.
You hate it.
You hate it.
I didn't say that.
I didn't say that.
I could wrap it up. Protect the other kids.
I could wrap it up. Protect the other kids.
I'll just strap it on the roof.
It's for the school bazaar.
Oh, it's bizarre alright. C'mon Bear. Let's get you out of here.
Oh, it's bizarre alright. C'mon Bear. Let's get you out of here.
Away from your crazy Mom.
Away from your crazy Mom.
The Ottos always waited for the bus with Bear. They were the only parents who did that, together like that. I guess they're what you might call hippies.
You want a cup of tea or something?
A cup of tea would be nice. Would it be alright if I sit down for a few minutes, Mrs. Otto? I want to talk to you.
But Dolores said she saw a dog and tried to...
How long has Dolores been driving that bus, Mr. Otto? How many times has she steered clear of danger? What went wrong that morning?
I didn't ask if you wanted milk.
No. A little sugar though.
No. A little sugar though.
We've only got honey.
We've only got honey.
I'll...take it straight.
He thought it was cute when I called him Frankenstein. It wasn't. I feel like his monster.
Isn't it a lovely day?
Isn't it a lovely day?
What happened to summer?
What happened to summer?
Summer's over. It's fall.
Summer's over. It's fall.
And winter?
And winter?
Well, winter's far behind us now.
How was it?
We had a terrible winter last year, didn't we, Sam?
So do you like your new room?
It's interesting.
It's interesting.
Your Dad spent all his spare time in here. He wanted to make it absolutely perfect.
Your Dad spent all his spare time in here. He wanted to make it absolutely perfect.
I feel like a princess.
Is this mine?
Yes. It's a present.
Yes. It's a present.
From you?
From you?
No. From Mr. Stephens. That was him on the phone just now. He was calling to see how you were.
No. From Mr. Stephens. That was him on the phone just now. He was calling to see how you were.
Who's Mr. Stephens?
Maybe we shouldn't be talking about this just now, with you barely home. Aren't you hungry, honey? Want me to fix you something?
No. What's this lawyer business?
Nicole!
It's the truth.
That was Billy Ansel on the phone. He wants to come over to talk to us.
Did he say what about?
Did he say what about?
No.
No.
Was he drinking? Could you tell?
Was he drinking? Could you tell?
Jenny, it's time for you to go to bed.
Is he coming over now? Right away?
That's what he said.
Hey, Billy! What brings you out on a night like this? C'mon in. Take a load off.
Would you like a cup of tea, Billy? There's a piece of cake left.
The Pied Piper of Hamelin. By famous Hanover city; The river Weser, deep and wide, Washes its wall on the southern side; A pleasanter spot you never spied; But, when begins my ditty...
What's a ditty again?
What's a ditty again?
It's like a song.
It's like a song.
Oh.
What's vermin again?
Rats! They fought the dogs and killed the cats, And bit the babies in the cradles, And ate the cheeses out of vats. And licked the soup from the cook's own ladles, Split open the kegs of salted sprats, Made nests inside men's Sunday hats, And even spoiled the women's chats, By drowning their speaking With shrieking and squeaking In fifty different sharps and

Nicole?
Nicole?
Yes.
Yes.
Can I sit beside you on the bus tomorrow?
Can I sit beside you on the bus tomorrow?
Don't you usually like to sit at the back? To wave at your Dad?
Don't you usually like to sit at the back? To wave at your Dad?
I want to sit beside you tomorrow.
I want to sit beside you tomorrow.
Okay.
Nicole?
What, Mason?
That's right.
Well, if he knew magic - if he could get the kids into the mountain - why couldn't he use his pipe to make the people pay him for getting rid of the rats?
Well, if he knew magic - if he could get the kids into the mountain - why couldn't he use his pipe to make the people pay him for getting rid of the rats?
Because...he wanted to them to be punished.
Because...he wanted to them to be punished.
The people in the town?
The people in the town?
Yes.
Yes.
So he was mean?
So he was mean?
No. Not mean. Just...very angry.
No. Not mean. Just...very angry.
Oh.
Oh.
Should I keep reading?
Should I keep reading?
Okay.
I don't like thinking about the accident. I don't even remember it happening. Besides, it just makes people feel sorry for me, and...
You hate that.
You can only feel lucky that you didn't die for so long. Then you start to feel...unlucky.
That you didn't die? Like the other children?
That you didn't die? Like the other children?
Yes. Like Bear and the Ansel twins and Sean and...
It would be strange if you didn't feel that way.
What do you want me to do for you, Mr. Stephens?
They work for the people we're trying to sue. Their job is to try to minimize damages. Our job, Nicole, is to try to maximize them. You have to think of it that way. As people doing their jobs. No good guys or bad guys. Just our side and their side.
I won't lie.
I won't lie.
I don't want you to lie.
I don't want you to lie.
The truth is that it was an accident, and no one's to blame.
The truth is that it was an accident, and no one's to blame.
There's no such thing as an accident, Nicole. Not in a situation like this.
There's no such thing as an accident, Nicole. Not in a situation like this.
You seem very sure about that.
You seem very sure about that.
I'm absolutely positive.
Dolores.
Yes. Dolores...and even your mom and dad. But I'll make sure you go last.
Yes. Dolores...and even your mom and dad. But I'll make sure you go last.
Why?
Why?
So you can keep on getting well before you have to go and do this. It's not going to be easy, Nicole. Do you understand that?
It was snowing.
Unless the report from the National Weather Bureau for the district on January 23 goes into the record, I will object to that question.
I object to the form of that question. Note that.
Was the bus on time?
There was nothing reckless in Mrs. Driscoll's behavior?
I object to that form of question. Note that.
Note my objection. She said, 'As I'm talking.'
Did there come a time when the bus turned off Staples Mill Road onto
Note that she said 'pretty clearly'. Not 'clearly'.
And what was the weather like at this time?
I have no questions.
Thank you, Nicole.
Do you have a room?
Will you be spending more than a night?
Will you be spending more than a night?
Hard to say. I might have...some business here.
What about Doreen?
She...she was a friend of mine.
She...she was a friend of mine.
When?
When?
At school. She fell for Kyle just before we graduated. Got pregnant, and...went to live in a trailer up on a woodlot Kyle's dad used to own. Kyle started spending more and more time at the Spread Eagle...

That's the local bar?
That's the local bar?
...coming home drunk and I guess feeling trapped by his life and blaming her for that...and...
What do you mean?
People who will help our cause.
That's great, Wendell. That's the sort of thing I need to know. So it doesn't come back to haunt our case later on.
There's the Prescots...
Tell me about the Ottos.
Wanda and Hartley. They lost Bear. He was their adopted son. A beautiful boy. Indian.
Wanda and Hartley. They lost Bear. He was their adopted son. A beautiful boy. Indian.
Indian?
Yes.
That's good. Judges like adopted Indian boys. Tell me more about the Ottos.
They're smart. Been to college. They moved here from the city about a dozen years ago.
What do they do?
What do they do?
Crafts.
Crafts.

Wanda does these photographic things. That's one of her pictures on the wall.
Have they ever been busted?
No.
Need a hand?
Sure, it you could find a towel in this bag. I know my wife packed one in there...
You always think you're prepared for these things.
Tell me about it.
Tell me about it.
How old is she?

Almost three.

Is this it?

Perfect.

Here we go.

Thanks.
I'm in a car wash.
A car wash! Wow, I've never talked to you when you've been in a car wash. Make sure you've got the windows closed.

The problem is I have no idea who I'm talking to right now.

Yes.
Why can't you talk to me?

That's not news, Zoe.

No. But this is. They wouldn't take my blood.
Do you know what that means, Daddy? Does it register?
Yes.
Yes.
I tested positive.

Welcome to hard times, Daddy.
What do you want me to do, Zoe? I'll do whatever you want.
I need money.

What for?

You can't ask me that! Not anymore! You asked me what I wanted. Not what I wanted it for. I want money.

Of...course I do. I just thought...I could get you another
I can hear you breathing, Daddy.
Yes. I can hear you breathing too.
Oh God, I'm scared.
I love you, Zoe. I'll be there soon, and I'll take care of you. No matter what happens. I'll take care of you.

I'm not sure if that will leave much on the plate.
Well, let's see what we get.
I'm sorry for coming over unannounced like this, Mrs. Otto, but the Walkers said you would understand. I know it's an awful time, but it's important that we talk.
Who are you?
Who are you?
I'm a lawyer.
I'm a lawyer.
You can't come here.
You can't come here.
Please, let me explain. I'll only take a moment of your time.
Please, let me explain. I'll only take a moment of your time.
No.
No.
Please.
The Walkers spoke very highly of you.
You've been retained?
You've been retained?
Yes.
Yes.
Their child died, and they got a lawyer.
It should be said that my task is to represent the Walkers only in their anger. Not their grief.
Who did they get for that?
Who did they get for that?
You are angry, aren't you, Mrs. Otto? That's why I'm here. To give your anger a voice. To be your
Dolores?
It's my belief that Dolores was doing exactly what she'd been doing for years. Besides, the school board's insurance on Dolores is minimal. A few million at the very most. The really deep pockets are to be found in the town, or in the company that made the bus.

You think someone else caused the accident?
You think someone else caused the accident?
Mrs. Otto, there is no such thing as an accident. The word doesn't mean anything to me. As far as I'm concerned, somebody somewhere made a decision to cut a corner. Some corrupt agency or corporation accounted the cost variance between a ten-cent bolt and a million dollar out-of-court settlement. They decided to sacrifice a few lives for the difference. That's what's done, Mrs.
So you're just the thing we need.
Excuse me?
Excuse me?
Isn't that what you want us to believe? That we're completely defenseless? That you know what's best?
Isn't that what you want us to believe? That we're completely defenseless? That you know what's best?
Listen to me, Mrs Otto. Listen very carefully. I do know what's best.
Are you expensive?
No.
No.
If you agree to have me represent you in this suit, I will require no payment until after the case is won, when I will require one third of the awarded amount. If there is no award made, then my services will cost you nothing. It's a standard agreement.

Are you a reporter?
No.
Kyle Lambston's a drunk. Nobody likes him. He's a nasty piece of work.
In what way?
Been drinking since high school. Fucked himself up. Used to be smart enough.
Any criminal record?
Any criminal record?
Probably half a dozen traffic convictions. Drunk driving. Lost his licence. That's why he don't work no more.

How does the family survive?
How does the family survive?
Don't know. Food banks, welfare, church charity. They scrape by.
Now on that morning, did there come a time, Nicole, when you left your parents' house?
Yes.
Yes.
What time in the morning was this?
What time in the morning was this?
About eight-thirty in the morning.
About eight-thirty in the morning.
Was anyone waiting for the bus with you?
No. I was alone. My sister Jenny was sick and stayed home that day.
Was there anything unusual about the driver, Dolores Driscoll, or the bus that particular morning?

And where did you sit that morning?

Did there come a time when all the children had been picked up?

Yes.
Yes.
You remember that much?
You remember that much?
As I'm talking, I'm remembering more about it.
Yes.
There was a brown dog that ran across the road up there, right by the dump, and Dolores slowed down not to hit him, and he ran into the woods. And then Dolores drove on and turned onto the Marlowe road, as usual. I remember that. I'm remembering it pretty clearly.

You are?
You are?
Yes.
I will offer that report. Well, then, now that your memory seems to be clearing, can you tell us what else you observed at that time?
Before the actual accident?
Before the actual accident?
Yes.
I was scared.
Why were you scared?
Why were you scared?
This is before the accident, Nicole. Do you understand what I'm asking?
This is before the accident, Nicole. Do you understand what I'm asking?
Yes, I understand.
Yes, I understand.
Why were you scared?
Why were you scared?
Dolores was driving too fast.
Mrs. Driscoll was driving too fast? What made you think that, Nicole?
The speedometer. And it was downhill there.
The speedometer. And it was downhill there.
You could see the speedometer?
You could see the speedometer?
Yes. I looked. I remember clearly now. It seemed we were going too fast down the hill. I was scared.
How fast would you say Mrs. Driscoll was going? To the best of your recollection?
Seventy-two miles an hour.
Seventy-two miles an hour.
Seventy-two miles an hour? You're sure of this?
Seventy-two miles an hour? You're sure of this?
Positive.
You believe that the bus driven by Mrs. Driscoll was going at seventy- two miles an hour at this time?
I told you I was positive. The speedometer was large and easy to see from where I was.
You saw the speedometer?
Yes.
Yes.
Did you say anything to Mrs. Driscoll?
Did you say anything to Mrs. Driscoll?
No.
No.
Why not?
Why not?
I was scared. And there wasn't time.
I was scared. And there wasn't time.
There wasn't time?
There wasn't time?
No. Because the bus went off the road. And crashed.
No. Because the bus went off the road. And crashed.
You remember this?
You remember this?
Yes. I do now. Now that I'm telling it.
What do you remember about the accident?
I remember the bus swerved, it just suddenly swerved to the right, and it hit the guardrail and the snowbank on the side of the road, and then it went over the embankment there, and everyone was screaming and everything. And that's all. I guess I was unconscious after that. That's all. Then I was in the hospital.
That was great.
Really?
Really?
You're going to blow everyone away.
You're going to blow everyone away.
You mean it?
You mean it?
Of course.
Of course.
You don't sound like one hundred percent absolutely sure.
You don't sound like one hundred percent absolutely sure.
I am. Really. It was awesome.
What's so funny?
Just the way Dolores gets so excited about bringing the kids to check out the animals. It's like the biggest thing in her life.
What took so long?
Nothing.
What's that?
Mrs. Ansel's clothing.
Mrs. Ansel's clothing.
Does it fit?
They say I'm lucky because I can't remember the accident.
Don't even try to remember.
How do you like it, Nicole?
The ramp?
The ramp?
Pretty slick, eh?
Pretty slick, eh?
Very slick.
Very slick.
Do you like the colour?
Do you like the colour?
It's okay.
It's okay.
And I had to widen a few doors. You'll see.
The door needs a lock.
Sure. I'll fix it right away.
That's too high. I'll never reach it.
Oh. I better get some spackle.
He's a lawyer. He's our lawyer.
You and Mom have a lawyer?
You and Mom have a lawyer?
Well, yes. He's your lawyer too.
Well, yes. He's your lawyer too.
My lawyer? Why do I need a lawyer?
It's because of the accident, Nicole. Most people in this town whose kids were on the bus have got lawyers. A lot of people...well, people in this town are very angry. Us included.
But you didn't lose me.
You're going to need special care for a long time to come. It's not going to be easy. Not for you, not for any of us. Because we love you so much. And it's going to cost money. More than we can imagine.
What about insurance? Doesn't insurance pay for these things?
What about insurance? Doesn't insurance pay for these things?
Partly. But there's a lot the insurance doesn't cover. That's one of the reasons we have a lawyer. To make sure the insurance gets paid and to help us look after the rest.

How will he do that?
How will he do that?
Well, Mr. Stephens is representing several families. The Ottos, the Walkers, us, and I think a couple more. Mr. Stephens is suing the town for negligence. He's sure that the accident could have been avoided if they had done their jobs right. He's a very smart man.
What are you up to, Nicole?
Nothing.
Nothing.
Nothing good on your T.V.?
Nothing good on your T.V.?
As opposed to this T.V.?
Are you sleeping?
No.
No.
Nicole, tomorrow Mr. Stephens wants you to make your deposition at the courthouse. I thought I'd take you over.
Nicole, tomorrow Mr. Stephens wants you to make your deposition at the courthouse. I thought I'd take you over.
Great.
Great.
You seem...I don't know...well, distant, I guess. Hard to talk to.
What do you mean?
I mean I'm a wheelchair girl now. It's hard to pretend I'm a beautiful rock star. Not like you used to tell me. Remember, Daddy? All the people that were going to discover me? Where are they now?
He couldn't look at me. But I looked at him. Right at him. His secret was mine now. We used to share it. But not anymore. Now, I owned it completely.
Well, okay. I'll take you about nine-thirty in the morning. That's okay with you?
Well, okay. I'll take you about nine-thirty in the morning. That's okay with you?
Great.
Yes.
How about Sunday night? That's always the best time.

Okay.
What's going to happen to Dolores?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Will the police do anything to her?
Will the police do anything to her?
It's too late for that. She can't drive the bus anymore. The school board saw to that right off.
It's too late for that. She can't drive the bus anymore. The school board saw to that right off.
She'll move away.
She'll move away.
There's talk of that.
There's talk of that.
Someplace where no one knows her. Someplace strange and new.
Well, there's the Hamiltons. Joe and Shelly Hamilton.
Yeah, right.
That sonofabitch owes thousands to the bank and half the businesses in town. He's about to lose his house and car.
But Charlene...
But Charlene...
Charlene's over at the Spread Eagle every other night. Sleeps with whatever she can get her hands on. She'll go down for a pat on the head and a fistful of peanuts.
Don't even think of the Bilodeaus or the Atwaters. They're all inbred.
The Ottos.
Yeah, well, they probably smoke weed.
You don't know that.
Loretta...Sidney Falco...
How do you do, Mr. Falco. If you know anything about horses, sit a minute. Help yourself to a glass of this N.Y. State champagne - that's what my husband buys me.
You ought to stop this nonsense, Loretta, these two dollar bets.
It's compensation, Leo, for the marginal life we lead. Sidney, did you hear the story about the cloak-and-suitor who -- ?

Oh, are you a spy for the other side?
Will you mind your own business!

Where are we running? What am I missing here?
Waiter, the check. This man is trying to hold a gun to my head!
Waiter, the check. This man is trying to hold a gun to my head!
That's the horse! Shotgun - Shotgun in the fifth!
How are you tonight, Mr. Falco?
Is "he" inside?
Is "he" inside?
But of course...
But of course...
Alone or surrounded?

A Senator, an Agent and Something - With - Long - Red - Hair.
Hello, Sidney. Wanna table?
Just hopping tonight. Leo Bartha been in?
Just hopping tonight. Leo Bartha been in?
Yeah, having supper with the Mrs. She's over there.
He's somewhere...
Thanks, I see him...
Come on boys, break it up...
The next time you want information, Falco, don't scratch for it like a dog - ask for it like a man!
Did she accept?
You don't like it, do you. I think she will accept, but I'm not sure. She may be too dependent on her brother.
Excuse me, Steve. I said namely you shouldn't go around wild, blaming people without justification.
I thought you might have a faint idea of how this item originated.
Boys, this gets nobody nowhere - you're over excited, Steve and -
Don't apologize for me, Frank!
Don't apologize for me, Frank!
...excited with good reason, I wanted to say. Because this endangers the future of the whole quintet...
I want to speak to Miss Hunsecker, please.
We're on our way there now...
I still think he's responsible for the smear.
Not that I'm convinced, but you'll never prove it in a million years. Steve, you'll do what you want, but it can't hurt; he offers you an olive branch - so today like olives!

I guess you're right, but -
I could think of better places to meet her, instead of here. He lives on the whole top floor.
I doubt that it matters any more.
Joe, give my nephew a drink.
Your nephew doesn't want a drink.
That's a lollipop that, boy. The kid is only great.
And with ten percent of his future, you're great, too, Frank.
Went over to Philly yesterday an' seen the folks...it's nice you send them the fifty a month...
See my mother?
See my mother?
I only had a few hours.
Thanks for the publicity spread you got the boys for the benefit tomorrow.
Robard's my client. I did it for him and his club, not your boys.
Frank, I think maybe you lied to me.
Looka, Sidney, you're my own sister's son, but where does that give you the right to call me a liar?
Looka, Sidney, you're my own sister's son, but where does that give you the right to call me a liar?
You told me that your boy was washed up with Susie Hunsecker, didn't you?
You told me that your boy was washed up with Susie Hunsecker, didn't you?
Yeah, and it's the truth, to the best of my knowledge. And, frankly, I'm glad. For Steve's sake, I'm glad, not yours. I manage these boys and I got their best interests at heart. Steve shouldn't get mixed up with no bimbo at his age.

You told him that?
You told him that?
Not in those exact words - you know what a temper he's got.
When do these hot-headed boys of yours go on the road?
Coupla weeks. For eight weeks.
Coupla weeks. For eight weeks.
That's a nice tour. All booked? When was Susie around here last?

Four five nights ago. That's how I know the romance is off. Also Steve's in a very bad mood.

Listen, Frank, you'd better make sure you're telling me the truth.
Listen, Frank, you'd better make sure you're telling me the truth.
I don't like this threatening attitude. When it comes to it, what the heck is it your business what they do, this boy and girl...
...People catch on quick to such an item. Van Cleve already called me - he's firing the quintet.
Then what are you doing here? Go over there and fight! If Van Cleve fires your boy, it gives a lie the ring of truth!
I see Bartha gave you cold tongue for supper. Hey, wait a minute!
I'm late for a date with a dame.
How is dear old J.J. by the way?
Call him up and ask - he might drop dead with shock.
Call him up and ask - he might drop dead with shock.
If it were that easy, you wouldn't find an empty phone booth for the next two hours...
You don't know that lunatic yet? Whims - egotistic whims! Like the gag - when you got him for a friend, you don't need an enemy! That's what the fight with Bartha was about. "Leo", I says, "Hunsecker froze me out. So I'm eating humble pie this month - please print me an item."
And, instead, he printed his heel in your face?
And, instead, he printed his heel in your face?
I see you're full of human feelings...
Friends call me Otis - sometimes Tricky Otis.
Otis was outraged when I told him Van Cleve was going to fire you. Tell him not to pay any attention to anything you-know-who says about you-know-what. Right, Otis?

I hate J.J. -- but not that much at this moment...
Give me a chance --
Blessings on thee, the both...well... Gotta run now. See you two kids later!
Hurry back.
Well, son, looks like you went out and bought yourself a packet of trouble...
You've been very kind about it, Mr. Hunsecker. HUNSECKER Give Susie credit for that. I took her word that there was nothing to the smear. Matter of fact, I'll have my say about smears on the show today. That's why I'd like YOUR personal assurance, too.

I'll by that, son. Now, you owe ME a favor. Be good to my kid sister...
Take it easy, Susie. He wouldn't be much of a man if he didn't understand my concern. Would you, son?
No, I wouldn't...
No, I wouldn't...
Serious as a deacon...I like it. I like your style, son! In a world of old rags and bones, I like it! For instance, take Sidney.
Does he have to be here in our hair?
Why, has he bothered you before?

Nuts! I'm not here as an artist! I'm here as an average Joe, who happens to love your sister Susie!
Well, just be careful you don't knock her down, huh?
Frankly, son, you lost me on that last hill. Just give us the punch line...
No punch line. Maybe I was just admiring your know-how---yours and Falco's.

Why do you keep coupling me with Falco?
Why do you keep coupling me with Falco?
He's here, isn't he? Do you think, sir, when he dies he'll go to the dog and cat heaven?
I don't take kindly to you and Falco selling me ethics. Who's the injured party here, you?
Right now you're in no position to ask questions! And your snide remarks---
Right now you're in no position to ask questions! And your snide remarks---
Wait a minute, I haven't handed over punishing privileges to you YET! Put the whip down and I might respect what you're saying...
Mr. Hunsecker, you've got more twists than a barrel of pretzels.
You hear that, Susie... Continue please...
You hear that, Susie... Continue please...
I'm afraid I can't cope with them.
Susie, as always, is free to say anything she thinks. Go on, dear, say exactly what's on your mind, dear.
Those "dears" sound like daggers. May I suggest that you stop DARING her to speak?

Son, you raise your voice again and you'll be outa here on your golden pratt!
If looks could kill, I'm dead...
No, I don't care about you -- you're fantastic. My whole interest, if it's not too late, is in Susie...and how to undo what you've done to her...
No, I don't care about you -- you're fantastic. My whole interest, if it's not too late, is in Susie...and how to undo what you've done to her...
And what have I done to her, besides not buy her a new fur coat lately? Sidney, you were right -- the boy's a dilly.
And what have I done to her, besides not buy her a new fur coat lately? Sidney, you were right -- the boy's a dilly.
Why? Because I don't like the way you toy with human lives? - Your contempt and malice? Because I won't be the accomplice of your sick ego - and the way it's crippled Susie...? You think of yourself - you and your column - you see yourself as a national glory...but to me, and thousands of others like me, you and your slimy scandal,

Son, I don't fancy shooting mosquitoes with elephant guns. So suppose you just shuffle along and call it a day...
But my day with Susie isn't over yet and--
Ten'll get you fifty you're playing hookey from a padded cell!
Susie, you're very much in my thoughts today.
Why?
Why?
What a question, dear, with that newspaper in your hand...
What a question, dear, with that newspaper in your hand...
Did Sidney tell you about it?
Did Sidney tell you about it?
Yes, he phoned. I don't know this boy too well. Anything in these charges?
Not being partial, are you?
No, I'm not. I'm not!
Why are you trembling, dear...?
History repeats itself. Everything that happened to Alan Leslie...began with a smear like this...
It's just as if I've seen a ghost today...
But that wasn't your fault, dear, what happened to Leslie. I've told you that a million times...
Then whose fault was it, J.J.? It was someone's fault, wasn't it?
I wouldn't have called the boy exactly balanced...
I wouldn't have called the boy exactly balanced...
Alan was not...unbalanced when I married him. And he was not...'indifferent to women' no matter what they said! HUNSECKER I'm not fighting with you, puss...
Sidney is a liar!
Who said Sidney?
Who said Sidney?
I said Sidney!...
You know, dear, we're drifting apart, you and I, and I don't like that.
I thought we were talking about Sidney?
I thought we were talking about Sidney?
Let me finish, dear. You had your say, now let me have mine...
Let me finish, dear. You had your say, now let me have mine...
I haven't said anything yet, J.J., but if -
I started to say we're drifting apart. A year ago, in your wildest dreams, would you have walked by that door without taking up this situation with me? Today I had to call you in!
I'm taking up the situation with you now...
I'm taking up the situation with you now...
Susie, I want to help you--, there's nothing I won't do for you. You're all I've got in the whole, wide world.
When I'm certain, I'll let you know...
A man couldn't ask for a squarer shake. Let me have Billy Van Cleve... Don't ever tell anyone, Susie, how I'm tied to your apron strings... Billy! J.J.! What's this about that boy? What boy? Where are we, lug, in a drawing room comedy? You're brain is warming up, sweetheart - yeah, Dallas!... No, don't explain your point of view, but...
Susie likes to keep her girlish secrets. But in her heart of hearts I imagine, Dallas, that she fancies you in an uncommon way. Now, what about YOU, son? Not just tom-catting around...I hope?
J.J., Steve isn't...
Susie, did you know about this accusation...?
No...
No...
Before you leave, son, I'll answer your question---Susan Hunsecker is the injured party here! Or will I be hearing next that I don't even have my sister's welfare at heart...
Susie, I'm sorry if---
Sometimes I think ALL men are fools!...
You in a mood, Susie, to run over to Milgrim's later and buy a few new frocks?
No. I'm going home.
No! NO! Don't touch me!
Susan!...
Err...the Supreme Court story, I was telling you - Justice Black.
Yes, the Justice, that's right. But I think you had it in the column.
And I believe that's precisely where I read it, too. You see, J.J., where I get my reputation for being the best-informed man in Washington.
Now don't kid a kidder.
Now, come, J.J., that's a little too harsh. Anyone seems fair game for you tonight.
This man is not for you, Harvey, and you shouldn't be seen with him in public. Because that's another part of a press agents life - he digs up scandal among prominent men and shovels it thin among the columnists who give him space.
There is some allusion here that escapes me...
We're friends, Harvey - we go as far back as when you were a fresh kid Congressman, don't we?
We're friends, Harvey - we go as far back as when you were a fresh kid Congressman, don't we?
Why does everything you say sound like a threat?
Hello, Harry.
Bonna sera, commendatore. Come sta?
I just checked "downtown". Quiet everywhere tonight.
Incidentally, what happened to that doll? - You gave me the item last night. Still alive?
Incidentally, what happened to that doll? - You gave me the item last night. Still alive?
Yeah. At Bellevue. Still hanging on. But they still don't know if she was pushed.
Yeah. At Bellevue. Still hanging on. But they still don't know if she was pushed.
She mighta jumped. Love suicide? Check it for me, Phil...it's a real heart throb.
Say hello to Sidney Falco. Tickle him - he's been a bad boy tonight. He called you my fat friend.
I don't believe it.
Say, that's good - it's nice - in fact, it's APT, Harry!
Yeah, I got eyes. I put things together.
Yeah, I got eyes. I put things together.
I remember ONCE when you didn't quite "put things together". Boy! Was the Mayor mad!
Can I come out? No.
I have to talk to you, alone, J.J., that's why.
I have to talk to you, alone, J.J., that's why.
You had something to do for me - you didn't do it.
You had something to do for me - you didn't do it.
Can I come in for a minute?
Can I come in for a minute?
No. You're dead, son - get yourself buried!
Mac! I don't want this man at my table...
I have a message from your sister.
I know Manny Davis.
Everyone knows Manny Davis... ...except MRS. Manny Davis.
Match me, Sidney...
Not just this minute, J.J....
Why don't you answer the man, Sidalee? He's trying to take you off the hook.
You just had a good example of it. A press agent eats a columnists dirt and is expected to call it manna.
What, some cheap, gruesome gags?
You print them, don't you?
You print them, don't you?
Yes, with your clients' names attached. That's the only reason those poor slobs pay you - to see their names in my column all over the world! Now, as I make it out, you're doing ME a favor!
Yes, with your clients' names attached. That's the only reason those poor slobs pay you - to see their names in my column all over the world! Now, as I make it out, you're doing ME a favor!
I didn't say that, J.J.
I didn't say that, J.J.
The day that I can't get along without press agents' handouts, I'll close up shop, lock, stock and barrel and move to Alaska.
Spahish...that must show he likes "spigs", too.
I like Harry, but I can't deny he sweats a little.
You told me you'd break up that romance - when?
You want something done, J.J., but I doubt if you yourself know what's involved.
You want something done, J.J., but I doubt if you yourself know what's involved.
I'm a schoolboy - teach me, teach me.
I'm a schoolboy - teach me, teach me.
Why not break it up yourself? You could do it in two minutes flat.
Frankly, J.J., I don't think you got the cards to blitz me.
I don't?
I don't?
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think so...
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think so...
I'll listen one more minute.
Awright, that brings us up to five weeks ago. "Sidney, I got a nasty little problem here." Did I say no? I'm frank to admit - it don't jell as fast as we like... But all of a sudden I CAN'T GET YOU ON THE PHONE NO MORE! WHY?... And why, as of this date, am I frozen out of the column...
Are you finished?
Are you finished?
No, lemme finish. I DON'T LIKE THIS JOB! That boy is dumb only on matinee days - otherwise he's got a head. And Susan, like you said, she's growing up. Two heads. What I mean, we got a slippery, dangerous problem here!
No, lemme finish. I DON'T LIKE THIS JOB! That boy is dumb only on matinee days - otherwise he's got a head. And Susan, like you said, she's growing up. Two heads. What I mean, we got a slippery, dangerous problem here!
Not "we", Sidney, you!
Not "we", Sidney, you!
Correct me if I'm wrong - WE! Because when I'm out on this very slippery limb for you, you have to know what's involved.
Correct me if I'm wrong - WE! Because when I'm out on this very slippery limb for you, you have to know what's involved.
Ha! My right hand hasn't seen my left hand for thirty years!
I'll do it, J.J. - don't get me wrong - in for a penny, in for a pound. I'll see it through, but stop beating me around the head. Let me make a living!
What you promised - do it! Don't finagle around. It's later than you think.
Uh huh.
When?
When?
Tonight. Before you go to bed. The cat is in the bag and the bag is in the river.
J.J., I want you to get them back their job, Steve and the Quintet.
You mean they've been fired already, on the basis of this crude smear?
I know Steve. No.
Then maybe you can tell me if he's as solid as you say, why does he rap me every chance he gets?
Well, what have I got? Alimony to a pair of tramps? They're of no concern to me. It's you who count, but don't get me wrong - I don't intend to let you break your neck again!
J.J., you said you want to help me - prove it!
J.J., you said you want to help me - prove it!
How?
How?
Get Steve back his job...please...
Get Steve back his job...please...
He means that much to you...?
He means that much to you...?
Yes. With your "prestige" it only takes a minute - ten cents worth of American Tel and Tel.
Yes. With your "prestige" it only takes a minute - ten cents worth of American Tel and Tel.
You're picking up my lingo, hon.
You're picking up my lingo, hon.
I read your column every day...
Susie, I like this new attitude of yours. You're growing up and I like it! I don't like it when you're limp and dependent, when you're odd and wayward. This gives you a chance for real survival in a very lousy world. Because, don't forget, dear, you won't always have me with you, will you...?
No, I won't...
I'm not sure I can reach him in time.
Sure you can if you want to, and I know you'll want to... By the way, what's your beef against little Sidney?
I got that boy coming over here. What's so funny?
With a pocket fulla firecrackers - good.
With a pocket fulla firecrackers - good.
I think you loused this up but good. If I can trust my eyes, and I think I can, Susie knows all about your dirty work.

Can't hurt...
Can't hurt...
Can't hurt? I had to get him back his job.
Can't hurt? I had to get him back his job.
I like that, too. Look, J.J., we can wrap this up in one neat bundle, addressed to the dumps - to oblivion. We're going great, but please play it my way. I cased this kid. Know his ins and outs...He's fulla juice and vinegar, just begging for some big shot like you to give him a squeeze. Do little Sidney a favor: squeeze! -

But it's too late. I got him back the job...
No, that's the point - he won't accept your favor! The manager yes, but not the boy.
Well he's got her in a tizzy, I'll tell you that!
Sure, he steams her up - wants her to stand on her own two feet and all that jazz!
Sure, he steams her up - wants her to stand on her own two feet and all that jazz!
And who's feet is she on now?

Presumably yours... That's according to St. Dallas.

What's this boy got that Susie likes?

Integrity - acute, like indigestion.

What does that mean - integrity?
What does that mean - integrity?
A pocket fulla firecrackers - looking for a match! It's a new wrinkle to tell the truth... I never thought I'd make a killing on some guy's "integrity".
Full of beans, ain't you? But you know that you'll stand or fall by what you're doing now...
Calculated risk. Only we happen to know, J.J., that you like me. I'm your star pupil -- I reflect back to you your own talent.
Let's forget cats and dogs and other pseudo-literary remarks--- I'll just lay it on the line! What about that big rumpus in my office today? You were there, Frank! Where, according to St. Dallas, J.J. was responsible for the Elwell smear!
Don't go wild, Sidney.
Don't go wild, Sidney.
Wild? Take a look at them and see who's wild...
What are you so chipper about? If I put a cross on every one of your mistakes, you'd look like a graveyard!
But not for anything I did today...
But not for anything I did today...
Sidney, I know human nature. Susie lied to me - she'll see that boy again.
Are you listening?
How does it matter who's sister? The main thing, they're through and -
Why do something that would drive them right back into each other's arms? Not to mention that this time Susie would know who shot the arrow...
She knows now.
She knows now.
Why give her real proof? You nearly ruined her with her first husband - and you were right, J.J., - but she almost followed him out the window. What do you want - a chronic invalid?
J.J., it's one thing to wear your dog collar...but when it gets to be a noose...I'd rather have my freedom.
The man in jail is always for freedom.
Sidney, I told you -
J.J., I swear to you on my mother's life, I won't do it. If you gave me your COLUMN I wouldn't do a thing like that...
I was trying to build her up, not tear her down -
Is that why you were romancing her, you mutt! Let's call it quits, my dear. I'd like it fine if you found another home. That means the front door is open! Pack your things, rent a moving van and GIT! And as for marriage, let me hit you with a few choice facts: you aren't ready for marriage! You're incompetent - a capricious and
Talk to her, Sidney...
Talk to her yourself...
Listen with care - this will cost me everything, so you know I'm telling you the truth!
You're incapable of the truth...
You're incapable of the truth...
Susie, there's nothing wrong with Dallas! Your brother and I arranged it all. And if the Leslie boy is still a squooshy item in your life, forget it! - your brother arranged that one, too! I don't usually give away presents; but this is my gift to you: Get out of here! Leave this man!
I know...I know you're the strongest cop in town.
I call him the boy with the ice cream face!
What's all the rush? You said three o'clock.
He's leaving early. After this "set". He'll be out in a couple of minutes...
It's nice, Sidney, that you give me this tip...
- He's got them on him.
- He's got them on him.
...And he's got them on him. I appreciate a thing like that - I appreciate where you are looking out for the virtue of the city.
Is that a fact? He's a dilly, ain't he? By the by, what did he have against this boy?
He goes out with girls.
He goes out with girls.
Well, I'll be darned. And what does J.J. think he SHOULD do?
Well, I'll be darned. And what does J.J. think he SHOULD do?
Go out with DIFFERENT girls!
I thought he would.
Yeah... And another thing - he's gonna say you 'resisted arrest'... You know J.J....!
That's a question I usually like to ask YOU. Your secretary phoned.
What about?
What about?
Something about a Frank D'Angelo trying to reach you...
Could this be that boy?
Dallas? Could be. He doesn't look like a reefer smoker...
Bribing me again?
And why should I bribe the woman who holds most of my heart?
Who put this item in about the comic? "If there's a more hilarious funny man around than Herbie Temple at the Palace, you'll have to pardon us for not catching the name. We were too busy screaming." Does this Temple have a press agent?
No. It's one of J.J.'s occasional beau gestes. Evidently the fellow's funny, so he gave him a plug.
What's your favorite ribbon to go around your favorite chocolates?
Let's wait till Christmas - it's more legitimate then.
Don't you ever get messages, Eyelashes? I called you twice.
I've been up to here. Listen, honey, tell me something. You know Susan Hunsecker...? Has she been in? I mean lately, in the last coupla days...?
I've been up to here. Listen, honey, tell me something. You know Susan Hunsecker...? Has she been in? I mean lately, in the last coupla days...?
I don't think so.
I don't think so.
You're sure. Find out for me.
You're sure. Find out for me.
Sidney, can I talk to you a minute?
Is Frank D'Angelo around?
At the bar - Sidney...
Don't tell me you started a polka with Leo Bartha?
No. That's what I mean - I'm being fired for what I didn't do.
Avidly. He was staring.
Staring. Consequently, when he approached me on his way out I wasn't surprised, but I didn't let on.

We're old friends, Chickie - quit it! A big columnist comes in this room, without his ball-and-chain and you make like a delicatessen counter! What did you think would happen in his house?
We're old friends, Chickie - quit it! A big columnist comes in this room, without his ball-and-chain and you make like a delicatessen counter! What did you think would happen in his house?
But, Sidney darling, the man must be out of his mind - it was only eleven o'clock in the morning!
Do you think you could do something, Sidney?
That's what I'm thinking, Rita. Maybe...
Do you still keep your key under the mat?
Can you be there by two-thirty?
Rita, say hello to Otis Elwell.
Hello.
Back?
One of those business meetings, honey - always coming up in the middle of the night.
Don't you know who that man is?
Yeah. Otis Elwell. The columnist.
Yeah. Otis Elwell. The columnist.
Yeah!
Yeah!
And he's a perfect stranger to me.
And he's a perfect stranger to me.
So take five minutes! Get acquainted! He's an important man - he's lonely - don't be dumb!
What do you want all of a sudden - Lady Godiva...? Where's my other shoe?
What kind of an act is this?
Don't you think I have any feelings? What am I? A bowl of fruit? A tangerine that peels in a minute?
I beg your pardon! I turn myself inside out to help you and now I'm a heavy. Here's your shoe, there's your coat, that's the door!
Sidney...I...I don't do this sort of thing...
What sort of thing?
What sort of thing?
This sort of thing!
This sort of thing!
Listen, you need him for a favor, don't you! And so do I! I need his column--tonight. Didn't you ask me to do something about your job? Don't you have a kid in Military School?
A girl needs a little romancing before she -

Nothing I didn't think of you before.
Nothing I didn't think of you before.
- that's what I mean!
That's the third time he's called today.
He wants me to break a leg?
He wants me to break a leg?
No, an arm, he said. I told him you were sure the item would be in Mr. Hunsecker's column in tomorrow's...
No, an arm, he said. I told him you were sure the item would be in Mr. Hunsecker's column in tomorrow's...
It isn't. I've just seen the early edition.
It isn't. I've just seen the early edition.
But...

That makes five days in a row that Mr. Hunsecker's cut you out of his column.

May I rent you out as an adding machine.
Who else phoned?
The renting agent and the tailor.

Pay the rent. Let the tailor wait.
Pay the rent. Let the tailor wait.
It won't leave much of a balance in the bank... Mr. Robard? Could you locate him?
I wish I could help in some way, Sidney.
Help me with two minutes of silence!
Go home, Sally. It's late...
I hate to see you like this --
Yes, but as a new subscriber you're under no obligation to take more than three books. And if you mail the enclosed card within ten days --
Sidney, I know you by now. Don't do a dance with me...
Sidney, I know you by now. Don't do a dance with me...
You mean you don't want the extra free gift of a colorful giant map of the world???
You mean you don't want the extra free gift of a colorful giant map of the world???
Sidney, please, dear, if you feel nervous...
So what'll you do if I feel nervous? You'll open your meaty, sympathetic arms...?
Sid...you got me so...I don't know what...
You ought to be used to me by now.
I'm used to you...
I'm used to you...
No. You think I'm a hero. I'm no hero. I'm nice to people where it pays me to be. I gotta do it too much on the outside, so don't expect me to kow-tow in my own office. I'm in a bind right now with Hunsecker so -- Every dog has his day! Lock up and leave the key.
If that's for me, tear it up!
Take a top coat.
Take a top coat.
And leave a tip in every hat-check room in town?
What's the matter?
Nothing...
Did you send my folks in Philly the check...?
Yes.
I put a lotta trust in you, Chickie...
I know you do, Sidney.
I know you do, Sidney.
Don't judge a situation where you don't know what's involved...
I swear, Sidney, I can't help it - sometimes I wonder what I see in you...
That's no way to talk...
That's no way to talk...
Or what you see in me, for that matter...
Or what you see in me, for that matter...
Stay down town tonight. Maybe we'll take in a show, etc.
Stay down town tonight. Maybe we'll take in a show, etc.
If you want me to -
Where's those glossy prints you promised? Tonight's the latest I can place them -
Well, thanks, anyway - let's forget it. It's cold out here, Susie.
I'm feeling too good to fight with you, but that isn't what I said - I said you snoop. For instance, what were you doing around my hotel the other night?
Begging your pardon, I haven't been down the bowery in years!
It's a habit with me. So now I'm briefed. So what?
Frank thinks I shouldn't have come here -
Why me...?
Why not you?
Why not you?
That's your idea of logic? I tell the Judge I didn't murder the man - the Judge says, "Why not you?"

Only two men in this town could be responsible for that smear - you or Hunsecker or both.
Only two men in this town could be responsible for that smear - you or Hunsecker or both.
Dallas, ask your own manager - he's standing here like a pained wolfhound - Hunsecker and Elwell are enemies to the knife. So how do you get him doing J.J. a favor?
Dallas, ask your own manager - he's standing here like a pained wolfhound - Hunsecker and Elwell are enemies to the knife. So how do you get him doing J.J. a favor?
It is a favor, isn't it?
It is a favor, isn't it?
According to you, yeah. Dallas, your mouth is as big as a basket and twice as empty! I don't like you, comma, but neither do I go along with this column saying you smoke marijuana and belong with the Reds. Also, since we're talking repulsive, J.J. won't like this for two cents! Don't give me that look, Dallas - J.J. believes in fair play.
You're talking very fast.
Well, I'll tell you what - excuse me for breathing, will ya? How do you like it? He comes to my office and -
Frank, you don't listen! J.J. just told you to shut your mouth!
Don't you think it's about time you shut yours? Who are you to tell a man like Frank D'Angelo to shut up?!
Give him credit---the boy's gall is gorgeous!
Why don't we hear what Susie has to say?
You watch him, Al, I s...s...stutter!
Temple, I caught your act the other night and -

Did you now? On which bounce?

- and I just had to drop by and tell you how great I thought you were.
Cheers. What time is it, Al?
No, I don't mind. I'm busy too.
Good! We're all off to Utica, so excuse me, Mr. Frannis-on-the- Portisan.
If there's a funnier man in the world than Herbie Temple at the Palace...uh...pardon us for not catching the name, we were too busy laughing. No, make that 'screaming'. It's sweet of you, J.J., thanks. Probably see you at Twenty One tonight. No, for supper, late. Right. 'Bye...
Speak to this lad, Al, ... to Mr. Falco.
Speak to this lad, Al, ... to Mr. Falco.
See me in my office.
And it would cost a pretty penny, huh?
You tell him, I stutter!
You're touchy, Sidney - don't be so touchy...
I wasn't looking for a brawl. I came to bring him a present. Wanna bite to eat?
Feels like a Monday night, don't it...?
Not to me. Sometimes, the world feels like a cage. Then someone comes along and opens the door...and it's never Monday night again... I wish you and Steve could like each other.
Not to me. Sometimes, the world feels like a cage. Then someone comes along and opens the door...and it's never Monday night again... I wish you and Steve could like each other.
We stick in each others craw.
We stick in each others craw.
Yes, but why?
Yes, but why?
Well, for one thing, he thinks J.J. is some kind of monster.
Where do you come off to make a remark like that?
Who could love a man who keeps jumping through burning hoops, like a trained poodle?
Do you think J.J. likes Steve...?
Frankly, yes, to my surprise. He thinks he's very gifted - those boys'll go a big mile, he thinks.
It's given me a big lift to know that some people want me for myself, not just because I'm my brother's sister.
Chickie, I'll have to laugh at that - an attractive girl like you...!
I hope that J.J. really likes Steve, that it isn't an act.
Why should he put on an act? Your brother has told PRESIDENTS where to go and what to do!
It's not my nature, Susie, but I'll talk to you like an uncle...
But I don't need an uncle, Sidney.
Listen, get a good night's sleep - tomorrow's another day. Feeling sorry for yourself won't help.
I'm sorry about Steve, not myself. I'm even sorry for my brother. To be so lonely, without one real friend in the world - to have to hang on to a worthless rag of a girl like me because she's his only real family -
I'm sorry about Steve, not myself. I'm even sorry for my brother. To be so lonely, without one real friend in the world - to have to hang on to a worthless rag of a girl like me because she's his only real family -
Come on now, chickie, why don't you go to bed...?
And I'm sorry for you, too, Sidney. You're going down with the ship.
What ship?
Susie, whatever problems you have with J.J. - I didn't invent them! What're you blaming me for? If you learned to let out your hatred you would be better off!
Like you?
Like you?
Yeah! Like me! I don't choke on my own gall - I fight back! Let THEM choke, not me!
Yeah! Like me! I don't choke on my own gall - I fight back! Let THEM choke, not me!
I'm not a man, Sidney, I'm -
I'm not a man, Sidney, I'm -
I know that bit - you're a girl; you need a man to give you strength! So what do you pick such weak sisters for? Don't you know yet that you fight fire with fire, not with tear drops?
I know that bit - you're a girl; you need a man to give you strength! So what do you pick such weak sisters for? Don't you know yet that you fight fire with fire, not with tear drops?
I could almost forgive you if what you did to Steve came from jealousy and love...
I could almost forgive you if what you did to Steve came from jealousy and love...
I didn't do anything!
I didn't do anything!
...but you did it for greed, Sidney - and that's pathetic.
Don't run away - I was always the man for you! I'm talking to you out of two years of silence - listen to what I say! Inside of six months -
Please, Sidney, I can't stand this -
J.J., if you think -
Don't explain, Sidney... It doesn't matter now...
Jimmy! This is a coincidence. I am just going -
Yeah. A coincidence you should run into the very man you've been ducking all week! This is my press agent, Joan.
I tried to reach you twice -
What do you do for that hundred a week. Fall out of bed?
What do you do for that hundred a week. Fall out of bed?
Jimmy, I'm on my way inside right now to talk to Hunsecker. I can promise you -
Jimmy, I'm on my way inside right now to talk to Hunsecker. I can promise you -
Joan, call a cop! We'll arrest this kid for larceny!
Listen, when your band was playing at Roseland -
That was two months ago. Take your hand out of my pocket, thief!
No more you don't! What is this - You're showing off for her? They're supposed to hear you in Korea?
He's intuitive - he knows he's getting fired!
He's intuitive - he knows he's getting fired!
If you're funny, James, I'm a pretzel! Drop dead!
This is big, you know. Very big! Let's go out later, drink some firewater. With the boys. Fred can call Millie and -
Steve, I'd rather you didn't say anything for a day or two...until I tell my brother...
You haven't told him yet...
I'm telling him in the morning after breakfast.
Steve, my brother isn't as bad as he's painted. He isn't perfect, but -
But he isn't going to like this, Susie. And he makes you nervous, not me. No, I take that back - he makes me nervous, too. But I wouldn't give him a second thought if not for you.
His stooge, Falco, is around - I saw him walk in. He's been spying on me for weeks, Susie.
Darling, I don't care - really I don't. Sidney'd had a secret crush on me for years, but nothing we do is his business -
Darling, I don't care - really I don't. Sidney'd had a secret crush on me for years, but nothing we do is his business -
But he could be reporting back to your brother, couldn't he?
But he could be reporting back to your brother, couldn't he?
Steve, dear, please forget all of this. What can it matter after tomorrow?
I have a message for you; I love you. May I dedicate the next number to you?...And the next, and the next. Every Sunday I'll buy you a new bonnet -
If the stores are open -
If the stores are open -
And on Monday, I'll take it off and stroke your light brown hair and -
And on Monday, I'll take it off and stroke your light brown hair and -
And on Tuesday - Hasenpfeffer. STEVE How do you think I realized I love you?
And on Tuesday - Hasenpfeffer. STEVE How do you think I realized I love you?
I made you write a beautiful song...
I made you write a beautiful song...
No, you had me eating that Chinese food!...
I get the feeling, Falco, that you're always snooping around...
Steve, stop it please...
Hello, Steve. I'm glad you could come.
Why did you call me?
Why did you call me?
Would you buy me a cup of coffee? In there...
Steve...what you tried to do today...you tried to take me up on a high mountain...I couldn't go all the way...I failed you... Will you forgive me? Have I lost you, Steve? Have I...?
Well, maybe I was wrong, too... But there's no doubt, Susie, that we have to face some serious things...
Well, maybe I was wrong, too... But there's no doubt, Susie, that we have to face some serious things...
No one's ever stood up to my brother the way you did.
No one's ever stood up to my brother the way you did.
But you didn't do much about it, Susie. You walked out, and there I was...solo...and not too good at that.
But you didn't do much about it, Susie. You walked out, and there I was...solo...and not too good at that.
I just didn't think that I could antagonize him, Steve -- for OUR sake, I mean.
I just didn't think that I could antagonize him, Steve -- for OUR sake, I mean.
Susie, I was there for OUR sake, too. But what a world it would be if we were all afraid to learn to walk and talk because it might offend poppa! By the way, I think your brother was completely responsible for the smears...
Steve, I...
But I don't care about that now. He knew what he was doing today. He was laying down the conditions under which he MIGHT consent to our marriage - if I would bend to every whim of his, like Sidney! I couldn't do that, Susie...
No! I'm saying that for your sake you have to make a clean break with your brother!
But, please, Steve, please - one step at a time! I was born only yesterday!...
But, please, Steve, please - one step at a time! I was born only yesterday!...
I told your brother I couldn't be his accomplice. I can't be yours either, Susie, and encourage him to go on pulverizing you. I know what type - he's my old man all over again!
Steve, I feel exhausted...what do you want me to do?
Not what you're doing now. At least don't ask me - don't ask him. You're fighting for your life! What do YOU want to do?
Not what you're doing now. At least don't ask me - don't ask him. You're fighting for your life! What do YOU want to do?
You are saying goodbye, aren't you...?
You going to work all day?
I'm sorry, baby. This thing is just kicking my ass. I thought we had it with this one...
... but the output went to shit after three seconds. I'm thinking now it's the way I'm matrixing the command hierarchies...
You need a break. You'll see it clear when you come back.
You need a break. You'll see it clear when you come back.
I can't
I can't
Miles, it's Sunday. You promised to take the kids to Raging Waters today.
Miles, it's Sunday. You promised to take the kids to Raging Waters today.
Oh. I can't, honey. I'm on a roll here.
Baby, this thing is going to blow 'em all away. It's a neural-net process --
I know. You told me. It's a neural-net processor. It thinks and learns like we do. It's superconducting at room temperature. Other computer are pocket calculators by comparison. But why is that so goddamn important, Miles? I really need to know, 'cause I feel like I'm going crazy here, sometimes.

I'm sorry, honey, it's just that I'm thiiis close.
Imagine a jetline with a pilot that never makes a mistake, never gets tired, never shows up to work with a hangover. Meet the pilot.
Why did you marry me, Miles? Why did we have these two children? You don't need us. Your heart and your mind are in here. But it doesn't love you like we do.
But I thought... aren't we changing things? I mean... right now? Changing the way it goes?
That's right! There's no way I'm going to finish the new processor now. Forget it. I'm out of it. I'm quitting Cyberdyne tomorrow... I'll sell real estate, I don't care,,,
Please... let... the kids... go...
Shut up! SHUT UP!! Motherfucker! It's all your fault! IT'S YOUR FAULT!!
Do you know about the chip?
What chip?
What chip?
They have it in a vault at Cyberdyne... It's gotta be from the other one like you.
They told us not to ask where they got it. I thought... Japan... hell, I don't know. I didn't want to know.
Those lying motherfuckers!
Those lying motherfuckers!
I was scary stuff, radically advanced. It was shattered... didn't work. But it gave us ideas, It took us in new directions... things we would never have thought of. All this work is based on it.
We should abort.
NO!! We're going all the way! You got that, Dyson?
Do you have bandages?
In the bathroom. Danny, can you get them for us?
My God.
Now listen to me very carefully.
Look, whatever you want me to do, I'll do. I just want my kids to have a chance to grow up, okay?
No one must follow your work.
No one must follow your work.
Alright, yeah. You're right. We have to destroy the stuff at the lab, the files, disk drive... and everything I have here. Everything! I don't care.
No good.
Let me try mine.
Now don't take this the wrong way, but you are a terminator, right?
Yes. Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.
Yes. Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.
No way!
Holy shit... you're really real! I mean... whoah! You're, uh... like a machine underneath, right... but sort of alive outside?
I'm a cybernetic organism. Living tissue over a metal endoskeleton.

This in intense. Get a grip, John. Okay, uh... you're not here to kill me... I figured that part out for myself. So what's the deal?
This in intense. Get a grip, John. Okay, uh... you're not here to kill me... I figured that part out for myself. So what's the deal?
My mission is to protect you.
My mission is to protect you.
Yeah? Who sent you?
Yeah? Who sent you?
You did. Thirty years from now you reprogrammed me to be your protector here, in this time.
So this other guy? He's a terminator too, right, like you?
Not like me. A T-1000. Advanced prototype. A mimetic polyalloy.
Not like me. A T-1000. Advanced prototype. A mimetic polyalloy.
What does that mean?
What does that mean?
Liquid metal.
Liquid metal.
Radical.
Radical.
You are targeted for termination. The T-1000 will not stop until it complete its mission. Ever.
Where we going?
We have to leave the city, immediately. And avoid the authorities.
We have to leave the city, immediately. And avoid the authorities.
Can I stop by my house?
Can I stop by my house?
Negative. The T-1000 will definitely try to reacquire you there.
Negative. The T-1000 will definitely try to reacquire you there.
You sure?
You sure?
I would.
I'm right here. I'm fine. What's the dog's name?
Max.
I need a minute here, okay? You're telling me it can imitate anything it touches?
Anything it samples by physical contact.
Like it could disguise itself as anything... a pack of cigarettes?
No. Only an object of equal size.
Well, why doesn't become a bomb or something to get me?
It can't form complex machines. Guns and explosives have chemicals, moving parts. It doesn't work that way. But it can form solid metal shapes.
We spent a lot of time in Nicaragua... places like that. For a while she was with this crazy ex-Green Beret guy, running guns. Then there were some other guys. She'd shack up with anybody she could learn from. So then she could teach me how to be this great military leader. Then she gets busted and it's like... sorry kid, your mom's a
Negative. The T-1000's highest probability for success now would be to copy Sarah Connor and wait for you to make contact with her.
Negative. The T-1000's highest probability for success now would be to copy Sarah Connor and wait for you to make contact with her.
Oh, great. And what happens to her?
Typically, the subject being copied is terminated.
TERMINATED!? Shit! Why didn't you tell me? We gotta right now!
TERMINATED!? Shit! Why didn't you tell me? We gotta right now!
Negative. She is not a mission priority.
Negative. She is not a mission priority.
Yeah, well fuck you, she's a priority to me!
Oww! Why'd you do that?
You told me to.
You have to do what I say?!
That is one of my mission parameters.
That is one of my mission parameters.
Prove it... stand on one foot.
Jesus... you were gonna kill that guy!
Of course. I'm a terminator.
Listen to me, very carefully, okay? You're not a terminator any more. Alright? You got that? You can't just go around killing people!
Why?
Why?
Whattaya mean, why? 'Cause you can't!
Whattaya mean, why? 'Cause you can't!
Why?
Why?
You just can't, okay? Trust me on this.
Now remember, you're not gonna kill anyone, right?
Right.
Swear.
What?
What?
Just say "I swear I won't kill anyone."
Everything.
Cool.
Does it hurt?
I sense injuries. The data could be called pain.
How long do you live? I mean, last?
A hundred and twenty years on my existing power cell.
Affirmative.
No, no, no. You gotta listen to the way people talk. See, you don't say like "Affirmative" or some shit like that. You say... no problemo.
It someone comes off to you with an attitude, you say "eat me"... if you wanna shine them on, it's "Hasta la vista, baby".
"Hasta la vista, baby"?
"Hasta la vista, baby"?
Yeah, or "later, dickwad." Or if someone gets upset you say "chill out." Like that. Or you can do combinations.
Yeah, or "later, dickwad." Or if someone gets upset you say "chill out." Like that. Or you can do combinations.
Chill out, dickwad.
Chill out, dickwad.
That's great! See, you're getting it.
That's great! See, you're getting it.
No problemo.
And that's another thing. You could lighten up a bit, yourself. This severe routine is getting old. Smile once in a while.
Smile?
Smile?
Yeah. Smile. You know. People smile, right? Watch.
We're not gonna make it, are we? People, I mean.
It is in your nature to destroy yourselves.
Excellent.
Yeah, I thought you'd like this place.
Not even of dying?
No.
No.
You don't feel any emotion about it one way or the other?
You don't feel any emotion about it one way or the other?
No. I have to stay functional until my mission is complete. Then it doesn't matter.
Torque wrench please.
Here. I wish I coulda met my real dad.
Here. I wish I coulda met my real dad.
You will.
You will.
Yeah. I guess so. My mom says when I'm, like, 45, I think, I send him back through time to 1984. But right now he hasn't even been born yet. Man, is messes with your head. Where's that other bolt? Thanks. Mom and him were only together for one night, but she still loves him, I guess. I see her crying sometimes. She denies
Why do you cry?
You mean people? I don't know. We just cry. You know. When it hurts.
You mean people? I don't know. We just cry. You know. When it hurts.
Pain causes it?
Pain causes it?
Uh-unh, no, it's different... It's when there's nothing wrong with you but you hurt anyway. You get it?
Uh-unh, no, it's different... It's when there's nothing wrong with you but you hurt anyway. You get it?
No.
Alriight!! My man!
No problemo.
"No fate." No fate but what we make. My father told her this... I mean I made him memorize it, up in the future, as a message to her -- Never mind. Okay, the whole thing goes "The future is not set. There is no fate but what we make for ourselves."
She intends to change the future somehow.
She intends to change the future somehow.
I guess, yeah -- Oh shit!!
I guess, yeah -- Oh shit!!
Dyson.
Dyson.
Yeah, gotta be! Miles Dyson! She's gonna blow him away!
This is tactically dangerous.
Drive faster.
Drive faster.
The T-1000 has the same files that I do. It could anticipate this move and reacquire you at Dyson's house.

I don't care. We've gotta stop her.
I don't care. We've gotta stop her.
Killing Dyson might actually prevent the war.
Killing Dyson might actually prevent the war.
I don't care!! There's gotta be another way. Haven't you learned anything?! Haven't you figured out why you can't kill people?
I'll deal with the police.
Remember what I said, you can't...
Remember what I said, you can't...
Trust me.
Drive for a minute.
Where you going?!
We don't have much time.
What?
Is it dead?
Terminated.
Will it melt in there?
Yes. Throw it in.
No!
I'm sorry, John.
I'm sorry, John.
No, no no!! It'll be okay. Stay with us!
No, no no!! It'll be okay. Stay with us!
I have to go away, John.
I have to go away, John.
Don't do it. Please... don't go --
It must end here... or I am the future.
I order you not to!
Your foster parents are kinda dicks, right?
Gimme that Phillips right there.
Easy money!
Where'd you learn all this stuff?
So she's pretty cool, huh?
Actually, no, she's a complete psycho. That's why she's up at Pescedero. She tries to blow up a computer factory, but she got shot and arrested.
Actually, no, she's a complete psycho. That's why she's up at Pescedero. She tries to blow up a computer factory, but she got shot and arrested.
No shit?
No shit?
Yeah, she's a total loser. C'mon, let's check out the 7-Eleven, whatya say?
Out of the way, John!
No! Don't kill him!
No! Don't kill him!
It, John. Not him. It.
It, John. Not him. It.
Alright, it! We need it!
We're better off by ourselves.
But it's the only proof we have to the future... about the war and all that.
But it's the only proof we have to the future... about the war and all that.
I don't trust it! These things are hard to kill, John, believe me, I know. We may never have this opportunity again.
I don't trust it! These things are hard to kill, John, believe me, I know. We may never have this opportunity again.
Look, Mom, if I'm supposed to ever be this great leader, you should start listening to my leadership ideas once in a while. 'Cause if you won't, nobody else will.
Yeah. Drag, huh?
I need to know how Skynet get built. Who's responsible?
Mom? You okay?
I couldn't... oh, God. You... came here... to stop me?
I couldn't... oh, God. You... came here... to stop me?
Uh huh.
It's okay. It'll by okay. We'll figure it out.
I love you, John. I always have.
I love you, John. I always have.
I know, Mom. I know.
Yeah. Right. How were you supposed to know? Fucking men... all you know how to do is thrust into the world with your... fucking ideas and your weapons. Did you know that every gun in the world is named after a man? Colt, Browning, Smith, Thompson, Kalashnikov... all men. Men built the hydrogen bomb, not women... men like you thought it up. You're so
Mom, Mom, we need to be more constructive here. I don't see this as a gender-related issue. She's still tense. We still have to figure out how to stop it all from happening. Right?
I got it. Piece of cake.
Go! I'll finish here.
Ready to rock?
Ready.
John, get out of the way!!
SHOOT!!!!
I know. This is a dream, Sarah.
Oh. Yeah. They... make me take this stuff...
I love you. I always will.
Oh, God... Kyle. I need you so much.
They took him from me.
It's John who's the target now. You have to protect him. He's wide open.
It's John who's the target now. You have to protect him. He's wide open.
I know!
I know!
Don't quit, Sarah. Our son need you.
Don't quit, Sarah. Our son need you.
I know, but I'm not as strong as I'm supposed to be. I can't do it. I'm screwing up the mission.
I know, but I'm not as strong as I'm supposed to be. I can't do it. I'm screwing up the mission.
Remember the message... the future is not set. There is not fate but what we make for ourselves.
Kyle, don't go!
There's not much time left in the world, Sarah.
It has helped me a lot to have a goal, something to look forward to.
And what it that?
You said I could be transferred to the minimum security wing and have visitors if I showed improvement in six months. Well, it's been six months, and I was looking forward to seeing my son.
I see. Let's go back to what you were saying about these terminator machines. Now you think they don't exist?
But you've told me on many occasions about how you crushed one in a hydraulic press.
If I had, there would have been some evidence. They would have found something at the factory.
If I had, there would have been some evidence. They would have found something at the factory.
I see. So you don't believe anymore that the company covered it up?
So what do you think, Doctor? I've shown a lot of improvement, haven't I?
You see, Sarah... here's the problem. I know how smart you are, and I think you're just telling me what I want to hear. I don't think you really believe who you've been telling me today.
You broke my arm!
There's 215 bones in the human body, motherfucker. That's one. Now don't move!
You're already dead, Silberman. Everybody here dies. You know I believe that. So don't fuck with me!
Open the goddamn door!
This T-1000... what happens when you shoot it?
Ballistic penetration shocks it, but only for a few seconds.
Can it be destroyed?
Unknown.
You look like handmade shit.
So do you.
I'll bet. Makes you a more efficient killer, right?
Correct.
My CPU is a neural-net processor... a learning computer. But Skynet presets the switch to "read-only" when we are sent out alone.
Doesn't want you thinking too much, huh?
Doesn't want you thinking too much, huh?
No.
The man most directly responsible is Miles Bennet Dyson, Director of Special Projects at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.
Why him?
Why him?
In a few months he creates a revolutionary type of mircoprocessor.
In a few months he creates a revolutionary type of mircoprocessor.
Then what?
In three years Cyberdyne will become the largest supplier of military computer systems. All stealth bombers are upgraded with Cyberdyne computers, becoming fully unmanned, Afterward, the fly with a perfect operational record.
Uh huh, great. Then those fat fucks in Washington figure, what the hell, let a computer run the whole show, right?
Uh huh, great. Then those fat fucks in Washington figure, what the hell, let a computer run the whole show, right?
Basically. The Skynet funding bill is passed. The system goes on-line August 4th, 1997. Human decisions are removed from strategic defense. Skynet begins to learn, at a geometric rate. It becomes self-aware at 2:14 a.m. eastern time, August 29. In a panic, they try to pull the plug.

And Skynet fights back.
Yes. It launches its ICBMs against their targets in Russia.
Why attack Russia?
Why attack Russia?
Because Skynet knows the Russian counter-strike will remove its enemies here.

Jesus. How much do you know about Dyson?
I have detailed files.
I have detailed files.
I want to know everything. What he looks like. Where he lives. Everything.
The CPU from the first terminator.
Son of a bitch, I knew it!
I must be destroyed.
Can you get us in there, past security?
Is it safe for them here?
Take your kids. Go to a hotel. Right now. Don't pack. Let's go.
It's finally over.
No. There is another chip.
Are you afraid?
Yes.
... it's... like a giant strobe light, burning right through my eyes... but somehow I can still see. Look, you know the dream's the same every night, why do I have to --
Please continue...
It's not just a dream. It's real, you moron! I know the date is happens!!
I'm sure it feels very real to you --
I'm sure it feels very real to you --
On August 29th 1997 it's going to feel pretty fucking real to you, too! Anybody not wearing number two million sunblock in gonna have a real bad day, get it?

Relax now, Sarah --
Relax now, Sarah --
You think you're alive and safe, but you're already dead. Everybody, you, him... everybody... you're all fucking dead!
Where do you stand on all this?
On all what?
On all what?
On Furtwängler.
On Furtwängler.
I don't know.
You represent the United States now. We have a moral duty to be just and we have to be seen to be just.
Major Arnold believes he has a moral duty, too.
Major Arnold believes he has a moral duty, too.
Our duty is to help Furtwängler with his defence, That's why I want you to look at this... These are part of the transcripts of the trial at Nuremberg. We can't get them translated fast enough. But I guess you understand German, right?
That's because you had a proper upbringing.
That's right. I was raised very strictly. So don't speak before you are spoken to!

Right. So, this is going to be very formal, too, now. Lieutenant David Wills requests die pleasure of die company of Fraulein Emmi Straube at dinner any night she cares.
What does he mean, too correct?
I don't know.
Don't see me to my door, there's no need.
But I promised your mother.
Yesterday I read that Furtwängler was asked to lead the New York Philharmonic back in '36, Toscanini suggested it. Had he accepted, he would have become the most celebrated conductor in America.
When he made his decision, he couldn't have known everything. Especially not the way people like you do, who've returned from exile and feel that you have a right to pass judgement. Because you are blameless, you think you know best who is a sinner and who deserves forgiveness. But you have no idea how people lived here.

I don't know. But you and I already know that he has saved lives.
'Please remember that Dr. Furtwängler risked his life to help anyone who asked him. I personally testify to having seen literally hundreds of people lined up outside his dressing room after concerts to ask for his help. He never turned anyone away. After he heard me play... I am a violinist... he gave me money because I was unable to feed myself or my
And this, only one of these letters, Major. I have lots of them.
Lieutenant Wills reporting to Major Arnold. Sir.
For Chrissakes I hate that shit, cut it out.

I'm very sorry.

I'm Steve. What's your name?

I guess so, sir.
I guess so, sir.
You call me sir again and I'll make you listen to Beethoven.
Where you from, David?
was born here, in Leipzig. I escaped in '36. My parents, they sent me to my uncle in Philadelphia. They were to follow. But they delayed and...
I guess you admire musicians.
Some.
Some.
Don't. This is like a criminal investigation, David. Musicians, morticians, doctors, lawyers, butchers, clerks. They're all the same.
You think a whole orchestra, what, a hundred and forty or so guys, could be orchestrated?
I guess it's possible.
I guess it's possible.
So, what does the Russki want?

Colonel Dymshitz asked specially to see you.
Colonel Dymshitz asked specially to see you.
'Dim-shits'?
What the hell are they doing?
They're trying to sort out some of the works of art the Nazis stole from occupied territories. Who really owns what? That's Colonel Dymshitz, on the far side.
David, need to ask you something. You heard this rumour the British found something called the Hinkel Archive?
Yes.
Yes.
So what is it?
So what is it?
The British occupy the building where this guy, Hinkel, ran the Nazi Ministry of Culture and it seems they've... they've discovered his secret archive.

What's that mean?
What's that mean?
I don't know, but the British are excited about it, I know that. The rumour is Hinkel kept a file on every artist working in the Third Reich.

Jeez. And you think the British'll share it with their Allies?

Major Richards said he'd call to let us know.
Major Richards said he'd call to let us know.
That's big of him.
Okay, better question the next witness. I bet you a bottle of French champagne he tells us the baton story inside ten minutes.
Five minutes.
Five minutes.
It's a bet. You're the witness, Emmi.
You have a question for Helmuth, David?
Yes. What was the orchestra's reaction when they asked you to play for Hitler's birthday?
Yes, David?
Why not show Dr. Furtwängler the evidence. It may refresh his memory?
You see, Wilhelm, I'm talking about ordinary, everyday reasons. Which is why I want to discuss your private life. How many illegitimate children do you have?
Major, I don't see how this line of questioning could...
Major, I don't see how this line of questioning could...
David, what are you Counsel for the Defence now? Did you hear the question?
Isn't it true that before every concert you got a woman in your dressing room and gave her the old conductor's baton, isn't that true?
Major, this is deeply offensive and repugnant!
Major, this is deeply offensive and repugnant!
You bet.
You bet.
and totally irrelevant.
and totally irrelevant.
Not so, Counsellor. That secretary of yours, she wasn't just your secretary, she procured women for you, didn't she? As many and as often as you wanted.
Major, that's not a good argument. If Dr. Furtwängler did indeed enjoy all these... these privileges, he enjoyed them because of who he is and what he is. That's true of any leading artist in any country in the world.
But it still doesn't make them saints. They still have to get up and piss in the middle of the night, don't they? They can still be vindictive and envious and mean just like you and me. Well, just like me. Can't they?
What?
Your manner.
Your manner.
My manner? Why don't you go downstairs, get a cup of coffee and calm down? What's the matter, Emmi? What's going on with you? What's wrong?
Can I ask you a favour, Major?
Yeah.
Yeah.
When you question him again, could you treat him with more respect?
When you question him again, could you treat him with more respect?
With more what? More what?

Major, he may just be the greatest conductor of this century and that merits respect.

David, I don't understand a thing about you. You're a Jew. Are you a Jew?
David, I don't understand a thing about you. You're a Jew. Are you a Jew?
Yes, I'm a Jew. But I like to think first I'm a human being.
Yes, I'm a Jew. But I like to think first I'm a human being.
A human being, oh, good, I'm relieved, I thought you were going to say you were a music lover. This man, this great artist has made anti-Semitic remarks like you wouldn't believe. I got letters.

Major, show me someone who hasn't made an anti-Semitic remark and I'll show you the gates of paradise.
What is it with you, David? Where are your feelings? Where's your hatred, your disgust? Where's your fucking outrage, David?
Hello, Major, my name is Dymshitz. I'm glad to see you.
Colonel. Pleasure.
Colonel. Pleasure.
So, Major, tell me, have you questioned Dr. Furtwängler?
So, Major, tell me, have you questioned Dr. Furtwängler?
Not yet.
Not yet.
I've had two meetings with him. He's a great musician. Maybe the greatest conductor in the world. His Brahms, Beethoven, Schubert - unequalled.
I was in Vienna. I had with me an Austrian chauffeur, Max his name was, he spent time in the camps. We were looking at these Viennese cleaning up the bomb damage, scavenging for rotting food, butt ends, anything. I said, 'To think a million of these people came out to welcome Adolf on the day he entered the city, a million of 'em,
Furtwängler's in a different category.
Furtwängler's in a different category.
We're dealing with degenerates here.
A great artist will have great privileges in a Russian zone.
That's why he didn't get the hell out of here when he had the chance! I put that to him, he couldn't answer. Why didn't he go and direct in America, like that Italian, Toscanini.
Colonel. He had no sisters, no brothers, only a lot of love affairs.
Anyway, Major, why should he leave his country, his mother tongue, his family, his history, his past, his future, just because now, suddenly, there is a dictatorship? Why?

Don't talk about things you know nothing about. He was in a dictatorship!
Don't talk about things you know nothing about. He was in a dictatorship!
Yeah, yeah, art and politics, yeah, yeah, I heard all about that.
Yeah, yeah, art and politics, yeah, yeah, I heard all about that.
In a dictatorship, art belongs to the Party. If you want to be a conductor, you have to have an orchestra. And you can only get an orchestra if you have contact with the power. All over the world you need the right contacts and you have to make the right compromises.

This is what I'm saying. He must have had Party contacts.
There are good Party members who help, and there are dirty non-Party members who inform on you. Of course, they gave him privileges.
And suddenly, Steve, suddenly you notice that they like you. They honour you, suddenly you are the director of the best museum in the world, for example.
What museum?
What museum?
I'm sorry. Museum? Not... I said orchestra. Sorry. Believe me. Help me, Steve. You say you answer for someone from high up. I, too, have orders from high up. Very high up. We want Furtwängler. I'll give you in return the whole orchestra, four, five conductors. I need him, Steve.

No can do.

Let Furtwängler go. Please.
Let Furtwängler go. Please.
I have a duty.
I have a duty.
Duty? I am sorry, duty? Duty fucking duty. Trouble is, you Americans want everybody to live like you. We liberated Berlin, Major Steve, not you. Our duty also is to bring back the best of German culture.
I'm gonna get that fucking bandleader, Colonel. No deal. No fucking deal.
Then you're going to kill me.
You live here, in Berlin?
Yes.
Yes.
You do shorthand and typing?

Yes.
Okay, let's see. How long were you in the camp for?
Three months.
Three months.

There have been messages for you. A Lieutenant David Wills called from the Allied Kommandatura Cultural Affairs office in Wiesbaden. I don't know who he is.
Think you can get me any of that?
Oh yes, Major, I have recordings of all his symphonies. I kept them safe during the bombing. My favourite is the Seventh Symphony.

Mine's the Eleventh.

I'm kidding, Emmi. What about a record player? You have that, too?

No. Ours was damaged.

What's in those files?

The names of the members of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra since 1934 together with their questionnaires. Major, what am I to tell Dr. Furtwängler?
The names of the members of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra since 1934 together with their questionnaires. Major, what am I to tell Dr. Furtwängler?
You tell him nothing, Emmi. If he calls again, you say you know nothing. We're gonna keep him waiting while I get acquainted with his case and with the witnesses. And, God help me, with Beethoven.
I'm sorry.
Come in, Emmi, this is your office, too. Emmi, this is Lieutenant David Wills.
Major, Major... he's here ...
Shut the door, Emmi. Sit down, Emmi. We're going to keep him waiting, too.
Bruckner's Seventh, Major.
Do you know where the Adagio begins?
Do you know where the Adagio begins?
Of course.
Of course.
Put it on ready to play, and I'll tell you when to play it.
I'm sorry but I have to leave. I'll find other work. You'll have to get someone else, that's all.
What is this, Emmi?
What is this, Emmi?
I can't do this. It's not right.
I can't do this. It's not right.

I have been questioned by the Gestapo just like that. Just like you questioned him.

Emmi, stop! I want to show you something. Let me show you something and then if you want to leave, you can leave, please please. His friends, they did this. And he gave them birthday concerts.

But he had no idea, a lot of people had no idea. I only realised what was really going on when I got arrested.

If he had no idea, why did the Jews need saving? This is the question, Emmi, to all Germans: Why did the Jews need saving in this country? Why, if people had no idea?

I would like to go now, please.
I want you to understand why you're here. You're automatically banned from public life under Control Council Directive No 24. We're here to look into your case before you appear in front of the Tribunal for Artists of the Denazification Commission. You understand that?
I have already been cleared by a Denazification Tribunal in Austria.
I have already been cleared by a Denazification Tribunal in Austria.
What they do in Austria doesn't interest me one little bit. Okay? I have your questionnaire here, Gustav Heinrich Ernst Martin Wilhelm Furtwängler, born Berlin, January 1886. Orchestral conductor. And you say here you were never a member of the Nazi Party.

That is correct.
Could you tell us about being made a Prussian Privy Councillor. How did that happen to a non-Party member?
I received a telegram from Hermann Goering informing me that he had made me a Privy Councillor. I was not given the opportunity either to accept or refuse. After the dreadful events of November 1938, the violent attacks on the Jews, I stopped using the title.

What about Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, you used that title didn't you? But then I suppose you had no choice there either, because I suppose Dr. Goebbels just sent you a telegram saying, Dear Mr. Vice-President.

I don't think Dr. Goebbels sent me a telegram. I was simply told. In a letter, I believe. I don't remember exactly.
Goebbels and Goering were sure heaping honours on you. One makes you a Privy Councillor, the other makes you Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, and you weren't even a member of the Party, how do you explain that?
Goebbels and Goering were sure heaping honours on you. One makes you a Privy Councillor, the other makes you Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, and you weren't even a member of the Party, how do you explain that?
Well, there was a constant battle between Goering and Goebbels as to which of them would control German culture. I was simply a pawn. Anyway, I resigned from the Musikkammer at the same time I resigned as Musical Director of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. In 1934.
Then why did you conduct at one of their Nuremberg rallies?
I did not conduct at at the rally, I conducted on the evening before the rally.
I did not conduct at at the rally, I conducted on the evening before the rally.
That sounds like the small print in one of our insurance policies, Wilhelm. And what about April 19, 1942? The eve of Hitler's fifty- third birthday, the big celebration; you conducted for Hitler, didn't you? Was that in keeping with your view that art and politics have nothing to do with each other?

How come?

Could I have a glass of water, please? Please, Fraulein?
I made no deal!
I don't buy that.

It's the truth.
I keep hearing you helped a lot of Jews to escape. How did you do that?
I don't remember in detail, there were so many.

Did you call someone you knew?

I may have, as... as I said, I simply don't remember.
I may have, as... as I said, I simply don't remember.
Let me me help you, then. You picked up the phone and made a call - 'Hello, Adolf? Wilhelm speaking. Listen, old pal, there's a Jew-boy musician I want you to help. He needs a permit to get to Paris.'
Or maybe you called Goebbels or Goering? You were so close you were in the same shithouse as them.
May I ask a question?

Sure.

Then why is it, please, that another conductor who was actually a member of the Party, who used to play the Horst Wessel before his concerts, has already been cleared and is working again while I have to wait and wait and wait?

I don't know, he wasn't my case. Why did you escape to Switzerland just before the war ended?
I don't know, he wasn't my case. Why did you escape to Switzerland just before the war ended?
It was because I learned that the Gestapo was about to arrest me.
It was because I learned that the Gestapo was about to arrest me.
Why were they going to arrest you?

I believe it was because of another letter I'd written to Goebbels lamenting the decline of musical standards due to racial policies.
I believe it was because of another letter I'd written to Goebbels lamenting the decline of musical standards due to racial policies.
You didn't complain about the racial policies, just about the musical standards, is that right?
So, how did you learn that the Gestapo was out to get you?
During an enforced hour-long interval because of a power failure at a concert here in Berlin, Albert Speer, the Minister of Armaments, said to me, 'You look very tired Dr. Furtwängler, you should go abroad for a while.' I knew exactly what he meant.

You were real close to all of them, to Adolf, to Hermann, to Joseph, to Baldur, and now Albert, So, let's hear the truth, let's come clean. What was your Party number?
If you are going to bully me like this, Major, you had better do your homework. You obviously have no idea how impertinent and stupid your questions are.
I have a list of names here, people in your profession, who got out in '33. Bruno Walter, Otto Klemperer, Arnold Schoenberg, Max Reinhardt...
They were Jews, they had to leave. They were right to leave. I could not leave my country in her deepest misery. After all, I am a German. I... I stayed in my homeland. Is that my sin in your eyes?
They were Jews, they had to leave. They were right to leave. I could not leave my country in her deepest misery. After all, I am a German. I... I stayed in my homeland. Is that my sin in your eyes?
See, David? He can't answer the question. I'll ask it again, Wilhelm, and don't give me any more airy-fairy, intellectual bullshit!
Steve Arnold...
I've had enough of this, I'm leaving.
I've got to hand it to the British, David. You know what those guys are? Decent. Tell me, Herr Dr. Furtwängler, do you know Hans Hinkel?
Yes, a despicable human being. He was in the Ministry of Culture. His job was to get rid of Jews in the arts.
Yes, a despicable human being. He was in the Ministry of Culture. His job was to get rid of Jews in the arts.
Yup, that's him, that's the guy. You know what else the little creep did? He kept files, close on 250,000 files. And you know what's in those files?
Yup, that's him, that's the guy. You know what else the little creep did? He kept files, close on 250,000 files. And you know what's in those files?

Oh boy, you're gonna love this. Take your time with this now. Those files contain the details of every working artist in this country. Those files are gonna tell us who joined the Party, who informed and who was helpful.
It is now nine o'clock precisely. I do not intend to be kept waiting again.
Don't talk to me like I was a second violinist. Go back into the waiting room. Miss Straube will come and get you when I am ready to see you.
If it's too hot, open your tie.
I wish to say something.
I wish to say something.
Go ahead, be my guest.
When I last saw you, I was unprepared. I did not know what to expect. In these past weeks, I have been thinking more carefully and making some notes. You have to understand who I am and what I am. I am a musician and I believe in music. I am an artist and I believe in art. Art in general, and music, in
And what was that?
And what was that?
Maintain liberty, humanity and justice.
Maintain liberty, humanity and justice.
Gee, that's a thing of beauty, honest to God, a real thing of beauty. I'm going to try to remember that. Liberty, humanity and justice. Beautiful. But you used the word 'naive'. Are you now saying you think you were wrong? That art and politics can't be separated?

And when did you first learn that - when you sent the telegram? Was that the surrender signal, the waving of the white flag?

'Happy birthday, dear Adolf, love Wilhelm.' Or words to that effect. That sounds to me like you were dropping on your knees and saying, 'Okay, Adolf, you win. You're the number one man. Have a swell party.'

Think carefully, Wilhelm... maybe not in your own name, but as Privy Councillor or Vice-President.
I don't have to think carefully. This is utterly ridiculous.
You won't find it because no such telegram exists.
Well, I tried, you got to admit I tried. I thought I might just trap you there, Wilhelm, but David here was too quick for me. Smart move, David, smart move. No, I don't have the telegram, but I know it exists. And I want you to know, Wilhelm, we're going to keep looking for it because I believe you sent it.

Then you are wrong.
Then you are wrong.
Art and politics, yeah, art and politics. Let's look at that. You and the Berlin Philharmonic toured the Third Reich, played in countries the Nazis had conquered. Are you saying that conducting in occupied territories from 1939 on wasn't a commercial for Adolf and all he stood for?
Art and politics, yeah, art and politics. Let's look at that. You and the Berlin Philharmonic toured the Third Reich, played in countries the Nazis had conquered. Are you saying that conducting in occupied territories from 1939 on wasn't a commercial for Adolf and all he stood for?
We never, never officially represented the regime when we played abroad. We always performed as a private ensemble. As I think I already told you, I was a freelance conductor.

You know something? You should've written our insurance policies for us because you got more exclusion clauses than Double Indemnity. What do you imagine people thought? The Berlin Philharmonic's taken over by Doctor Goebbels and his Propaganda Ministry but Wilhelm is a freelance, so art and politics are now entirely separate? Is that what you believed ordinary people thought?

Yes, von der Null.

Von der Null?
How long's this going to go on, Wilhelm? I say von der Null, you say von der Null, I say von der Null, you say von der Null, we could go on all day. You know who von der Null is, don't you? Edwin von der Nuell, music critic.

Yes, I know who he is.
Yes, I know who he is.
Isn't it true that because he gave you bad reviews and praised this young guy, Von Karajan, called him a goddamn miracle, said he was a better conductor than you, then you had von der Null conscripted into the army and no one's heard from him since?

That's an outrageous lie!
That's an outrageous lie!
You sure you didn't call one of your close buddies and say, God in heaven, did you see what that guy von der Null wrote about me? The greatest conductor on earth. I want him out the way. He had the nerve to accuse me I am not playing enough modern music. Send him to Stalingrad. Isn't that what you did? You don't like

Well. Once he said he'd read what this man wrote about me.
Well. Once he said he'd read what this man wrote about me.
And what did he say?
And what did he say?
He said, 'Don't mind him. His job is to criticise, your job is to conduct.'
He said, 'Don't mind him. His job is to criticise, your job is to conduct.'
And what happened to Von der Nul?
And what happened to Von der Nul?
I have no idea.
I have no idea.
You've really no idea? I'll tell you what happened. He died in Stalingrad.
You've really no idea? I'll tell you what happened. He died in Stalingrad.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Now, that young conductor what's his name? That miracle kid, you know who I mean. Von Karajan! But you called him something else. C'mon. What did you call von Karajan?
Please stop playing these games with me. Why you should bring up the name of another conductor is beyond my understanding.
I'll tell you why. You remember we talked about you playing for Hitler's birthday? And you told me that Goebbels got to your doctors first, that you were tricked?
I'll tell you why. You remember we talked about you playing for Hitler's birthday? And you told me that Goebbels got to your doctors first, that you were tricked?
Yes, that's what happened.
Come on, admit it. K worried you, didn't he? He always worried you. In 1942, he's thirty-four years old, you're already fifty-six. And Goebbels and Goering keep saying to you, 'If you don't do it, little K will.' Never mind art and politics and symbols and airy-fairy bullshit about liberty, humanity and justice because I don't care how great you are. It's the oldest
This is absolute nonsense!
This is absolute nonsense!
Well, I'm just beginning to develop my theme. Isn't that what you call it in classical music, developing your theme? Okay, so they played on your insecurity. That's human, understandable. But, there is one guy who doesn't like little K as much as he likes you - yeah, the number one man your old pal, Adolf. He thinks you're the greatest, and when he

Of course there was a conspiracy against me, a campaign - even abroad.
I have illegitimate children.
What?
What?
I said I have illegitimate children. I don't know how many.
I said I have illegitimate children. I don't know how many.
You like the women, don't you, Wilhelm?
Stop this, please, stop this now!
No, I'm not going to stop it. Hitler himself offered you a beautiful house and a personal bomb shelter.
No, I'm not going to stop it. Hitler himself offered you a beautiful house and a personal bomb shelter.
I absolutely refused the house and the bomb shelter.
I absolutely refused the house and the bomb shelter.
But you see what I'm getting at? You get a gorgeous house, you're highly paid. What are you gonna do, stay or leave? One voice comes back at me: stay!
Okay, Wilhelm, go home now. Go home and think about these past twelve years.
I don't understand what you mean.
I don't understand what you mean.
No, that's your problem, Wilhelm. You understand nothing. We'll call you. Go!
Everybody says what a great benefactor you were to the Jews. But-- I have things here you said and wrote. Listen to this: 'The Jew composer Schonberg is admired by the Jewish International.' And what about this: 'Jewish musicians lack a genuine affinity with our music.' 'Jewish musicians are good businessmen with few scruples, lacking roots.' You deny you said these things?
Those attitudes do not exist in me.
Those attitudes do not exist in me.
I believe that. But just answer the question, don't give me explanations.
I believe that. But just answer the question, don't give me explanations.
Speaking to Party members I used their language, of course I did, everyone did.
Do you know what that is?
Of course I know what that is.

Okay, so what is it?

Bruckner's Seventh. The Adagio.
Who's conducting?
How can I know such a thing?
I'll tell you, then. The last time this music was played on these air waves was after they announced that your pal Hitler had shot himself. Listen to it. They listen. Did they pick little K's recording? Did they pick some other conductor? No, they picked you, and why? Because you represented them so beautifully. When the Devil died, they wanted his bandleader to
Have you ever smelled burning flesh? I smelt it four miles away. Four miles away, I smelt it. Have you ever seen the gas chambers, the crematoria? Have you seen the mounds of rotting corpses? You talk to me about culture, art and music? You putting that in the scales, Wilhelm? You setting culture, art and music against the millions put to death by
I love my country, I believe in music, what was I to do?
I love my country, I believe in music, what was I to do?
Look around you. See the country you served. Look at people who had real courage, who took risks, who risked their lives. Like Emmi's father.
Helmuth Alfred Rode. Second violinist since 1935. What's it mean, second violinist?
It means I wasn't good enough to be a first violinist.
Good, and according to your questionnaire, Helmuth, you never joined the Nazi Party.
Me? Never. Never.
Is it true you're going to interview Dr. Furtwängler today?
I'll ask the questions, Helmuth.
I'll ask the questions, Helmuth.
Excuse me. Did you know that he refused to give the Nazi salute when Hitler was present in the audience?
Oh, we didn't play for his birthday, we played the evening before - it was the 19th of April not the 20th.
Do you know Hans Hinkel?

Hans Hinkel was in the Ministry of Culture; how could I know such a man? I
I hear the British have his... his archive, files, records.
Do you know what's in this archive?

How could I know what's in the archive?
Major.
Helmuth.
Helmuth.
Guess what I am holding in my hand. You like guessing games?
Guess what I am holding in my hand. You like guessing games?
Love 'em, Helmuth. I give up. What are you holding in your hand?
It's Dr. Furtwängler's baton, which I stole.
The one he kept in his right hand. Yes, you remember.
The one he kept in his right hand. Yes, you remember.
Yes, you remember.
Yes, you remember.
How could I forget?
Show me.
Show you?
Show you?
Yeah, show me, I want to see you do it. Pretend I'm Adolf. You're the maestro, and you have the baton in your right hand, but you give me the salute just the same.
Yeah, show me, I want to see you do it. Pretend I'm Adolf. You're the maestro, and you have the baton in your right hand, but you give me the salute just the same.
Not here, Major, there are people, if anybody should see... please, please, Major...
Not here, Major, there are people, if anybody should see... please, please, Major...
Do it, Helmuth.
And I see what you mean. You nearly poked my eyes out.
Exactly. Replaces the baton, gives Steve the case.
Exactly. Replaces the baton, gives Steve the case.
Don't worry, Helmuth, it'll be our secret.
Great catch, kid. The boy runs off.
So. You wanted to see me.
You usually don't work on Sunday, Major?
All in the cause of humanity, Helmuth. Or should I call you one- zero-four-nine-three-three-one?
All in the cause of humanity, Helmuth. Or should I call you one- zero-four-nine-three-three-one?
What?
What?
One-zero-four-nine-three-three- one. Or d'you mind if I just call you 'one'?
Was a member of...? Speak up?
I was a member of the Communist Party. I was a communist. That's what Hinkel had over me. He knew everything. He held that over me. That's how he made me co-operate.
I was a member of the Communist Party. I was a communist. That's what Hinkel had over me. He knew everything. He held that over me. That's how he made me co-operate.
Oh, I see, he made you co-operate. And now are you a communist again?
Oh, I see, he made you co-operate. And now are you a communist again?
You don't know what it's like to wake up every single morning of your life terrified, you don't know that -
I can give you freedom of movement, freedom to work, freedom, Helmuth. But I need something in return.
Major, we're discussing a man of genius, I don't want...
Major, we're discussing a man of genius, I don't want...
Fuck that, Helmuth. You want to discuss symbols here? This guy was a front man. He was the piper, but he played their tune, you get my philosophical meaning? I'm not interested in small fish, I'm after Moby Dick. Come on, Helmuth. Hard facts.
The only thing I know is he's an anti-Semite.
Of course. You, too. Like everyone else in this goddamn country.
I've remembered something else...
Yeah?
Yeah?
Furtwängler sent Hitler a telegram for his birthday.
Furtwängler sent Hitler a telegram for his birthday.
He did?
He did?
One of your people told me.
One of your people told me.
One of my people?
Yes. A corporal. US Army. A Jew. He said he'd seen the telegram in the Chancellery.
Son-of-a-gun. We'll find the corporal and we'll find the telegram.
But I need documentary proof. You know of anything like that?
No. But that's why we hated him. We admired him as a conductor but we all hated him too because he didn't have to join the Party and yet he had a better life than any of us. He didn't have to go and deliver a report after every trip abroad. He got everything from them, everything. He was filthier than any of us
There's a rumour... I don't know if it's true or not... but ask him about von der Null.
Never heard of him, who is he?
Never heard of him, who is he?
Edwin von der Null. Music critic. He gave Furtwängler terrible reviews while he raved about Herbert von Karajan.
Edwin von der Null. Music critic. He gave Furtwängler terrible reviews while he raved about Herbert von Karajan.
Who's he?
Who's he?
Also a conductor. Very brilliant. Young. Von der Null called him 'The Miracle von Karajan'. Furtwängler was outraged and they say he had von der Null conscripted into the army. The same thing happened to another critic. True or not, it's not such a bad idea. Critics give you bad reviews, you have them sent to the Russian front. But if you really want

The Miracle Kid.
The Miracle Kid.
Yes, yes you may notice that he cannot even bring himself to utter his name, he... he refers to him as K.
And ask him about his private life.
His private life?
Goebbels, yes, Josef Goebbels said, 'There's not a single filthy Jew left in Germany on whose behalf Dr. Furtwängler has not intervened.' No, no one could have been less of a Nazi than Dr. Furtwängler.
But this was the same guy who conducted for Adolf on his birthday.
But this was the same guy who conducted for Adolf on his birthday.
He was forced to do that. But he refused to give the Nazi salute in front of Hitler. He kept his baton in his hand, you can't salute with a baton in your hand.
Oh! The evening before, I see...
Yes, Dr. Furtwängler was absolutely clear about this: politics and art must be kept separate.
Yes, Dr. Furtwängler was absolutely clear about this: politics and art must be kept separate.
Politics and art must be kept separate. I'll remember that. But let me see if you can help me with something I just don't understand. I'd really like to know why all you guys are so crazy about him. What's his secret?
You ever seen Adolf Hitler's eyes when he was making a speech? I've seen 'em on films.
Yes.
Yes.
Was looking at Furtwängler like that?

I don't know what you mean, Major.

When you got to the crescendo.
So, you never heard of him.
Nope.
Nope.
Do you know who Arturo Toscanini is?

Sure.

Well, they say here that when you went on a case, you stayed on it. Now we can't take every Nazi in this country to trial, although I would like to; it's an impossibility. So we're going for the big boys in industry, education, law, culture.

Like this bandleader.
Like this bandleader.
Well, he's more than just a bandleader, Steve. He's a great conductor, a gifted artist. But we believe that he sold himself to the devil. Your number one priority from this moment on is to connect him to the Nazi Party. Don't be impressed by him. I want the folks back home to understand why we fought this war. Find Wilhelm Furtwängler guilty. He

Absolutely not.
No, I was never a Nazi, I have no interest in politics, I'm a musician -
Hey, hey, slow up, Fraulein Straube has to take down what you say.
Dr. Furtwängler is a great musician. He actively opposed the Nazis and later on he helped many Jews to escape.
Then how do you explain him being made a Prussian Privy Councillor?
Then how do you explain him being made a Prussian Privy Councillor?
It was Hermann Goering. I was told he just made the maestro his Privy Councillor, no questions asked. Although Dr. Furtwängler stood up to him. And to Dr. Goebbels.

Pay attention. The 600 series had rubber skin. We spotted them easy. But these are new. They look human. Sweat, bad breath, everything. Very hard to spot. I had to wait 'til he moved on you before I could zero him.

Defense network computer. New. Powerful. Hooked into everything. Trusted to run it all. They say it got smart...a new order of intelli- gence. Then it saw all people as a threat, not just the ones on the other side. Decided out fate in a microsecond...extermination.
Didn't see the war. I was born after, in the ruins. Grew up there. Starving. Hiding from the H-K's.

It was an honor. A chance to meet the legend. Sarah Connor. Who taught her son to fight...organize, prepare. From when he was a kid. When you were in hiding, before the war.
I'm sure.
Come on, me? The mother of the future? Am I tough? Organized? I can't even balance my checkbook. I cry when I see a cat that's been run over... and I don't even like cats.
Ow! No, it's okay. It's better tight.

Let's go. Time to move out.
Fuck you! Let go of me!
Kyle?
I'm wrong here. I wasn't meant to see this...
Is this enough?
Yes. And I don't want to know where you got it.
I'm dying for a shower. You could use one too. And we'd better check that bandage.
Later. I'm going out for materiel. Keep this.
What's that?
Nitroglycerin, basically. Bit more stable. I learned howto make it when I was a kid.
Make sure there's none on the threads, like this. Now screw the end-cap on...very gently.
You must have had a fun child-
That's good. Now, seven more like that while I make fuses.
I was thinking, there's so much I've got to show you when we get through this. It's mind boggling, the pos- sibilities...Disneyland, the beach, movies...matinees with popcorn and foot-long hot dogs...

Kyle...
I bet you're ticklish.
Ticklish?
What are you doing?
You'll beg for mercy in a second.
I don't think I like this.
You're not supposed to.
Sarah.
We did it, Kyle. We got it.
What are you doing?
Cover...our footsteps...
So. You're a soldier. Fighting for whom?
With the One Thirty Second under Perry, from '21 to '27--
With the One Thirty Second under Perry, from '21 to '27--
The year 2027?
And who was the enemy?
SKYNET. A computer defense system built for SAC-NORAD by Cyber Dynamics. A modified Series 4800.

I see. And this...computer, thinks it can win by killing the mother of its enemy, kill- ing him, in effect, before he is even conceived? A sort of retroactive abortion?
I see. And this...computer, thinks it can win by killing the mother of its enemy, kill- ing him, in effect, before he is even conceived? A sort of retroactive abortion?
Yes.
...it had no choice. The defensive grid was smashed. We'd taken the mainframes... We'd won. Taking out Connor then would make no difference. Skynet had to wipe out his entire exist- ence. We captured the lab complex. Found the...what- ever it was called...the time-displacement equipment. The Terminator had already gone through. They sent two of us to intercept, then zeroed the whole place. Sumner
Then how are you supposed to get back?
Then how are you supposed to get back?
Can't. Nobody goes home. Nobody else comes through. It's just him and me.
You go naked. Something about the field generated by a living organism. Nothing dead will go.
Why?

I didn't build the fucking thing.

Okay. Okay. But this... cyborg...if it's metal...
Surrounded by living tissue.
Surrounded by living tissue.
Of course.
Why were the other two women killed?
Most official records were lost in the war. The computer knew almost nothing about Connor's mother. Her name. Where she lived, just the city. No scanner pictures. The Terminator was just being systematic.
You've heard enough. Decide. Are you going to release me?
I'm afraid that's not up to me.
I'm afraid that's not up to me.
Then why am I talking to you? Get out.
I can help you...
Who is in authority here?
...look, Lieutenant...uh, Vukovich, don't put me on hold and don't transfer me to another department...
I won't. Now just relax. Where are you? Yeah, I know it...on Pico. Are you alright?
I won't. Now just relax. Where are you? Yeah, I know it...on Pico. Are you alright?

Alright, Ms. Connor. Listen carefully. You're in a public place, you'll be safe 'til we get there. Stay visible. Don't go outside or in the restroom. I'll be there in a few minutes.
Here, drink some of this...
Lieutenant, are you sure it's them? Maybe I should see the ...bodies.
Lieutenant, are you sure it's them? Maybe I should see the ...bodies.
They've already been identi- fied. There's no doubt.
Sarah. Sarah, this is Dr. Silber- man. I'd like you to tell him everything Reese said to you. Do you feel up to it?
I guess so. You're a doctor?
Why don't you just stretch out here and get some sleep. It'll take your mom a good hour to get here from Redlands.
I can't sleep.
I can't sleep.
Go ahead. You're safe. There're thirty cops in this building.

That can't be right. That's the name of the one Valley Division mopped up this after- noon.
Here's her driver's license.

Like shit, boss.
Go! Go! He's got her.

It is so very inappropriate for you to mention my father. Or, did you think this, between us, was friendship? Just because you went fishing with my father, I should sit on my hands while you throw my money away?
Now, look...
Now, look...
I'll be done in a minute. You misspoke before. You're not "stepping down." I'm taking you out at the knees. The whole point is to prove that you're not deciding anything anymore. I'm firing you. Action's taken. Confidence restored. Stock goes up. I sell my shares.

I could fight you on this.
You could. But, if I leave without your signature, this agreement begins to disintegrate; benefits shrink, options narrow, compensations shrivel.
Are you finished?
No. This is my lawyer, Samuel Sutherland. I thought you two should meet.
