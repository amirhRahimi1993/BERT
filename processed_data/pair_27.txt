How'd the show go?
Okay. How'd yours go?
Okay. How'd yours go?
Not so good.
From Hurley's?
Eighty proof. What d'ya say? Think you can handle it?
Jack.
Yeah?
Yeah?
Can I stay here tonight? Even if she comes here?
Merry Christmas, Jack.
Merry Christmas.
There were more flowers last year. Mr. Rinaldi down at the drugstore says it's going to snow by New Year's. Says he can feel it in his elbows. I hope it snows. I want to make a snowman. You ever make a snowman, Jack?
Sure.
Sure.
That's what I want to do. I want to make a snowman.
John. It's good to see you.
Good to see you, Ma.
So. How are you?
Fine. You?
Fine. You?
Oh, fine.
Big piece or little?
Huh? Oh, no.
Huh? Oh, no.
None?
None?
I'm not much for sweets.
How's that dog of yours? What was his name?
Eddie.
Eddie.
Yes. Right. Eddie. How is he?
Yes. Right. Eddie. How is he?
He's losing his teeth.
Waxy Wright. Didn't Jon Archer bust you for poisoning five members of the Canadian parliament?
They never should've voted against U.S. statehood -- the scumbags. We heard you got wasted.
Do I look wasted -- asshole?
You look great, Castor. Really. Here -- I got a shot of your favorite -- Mescal. Even has the worm.
Don't they ever let us take these boots off?
Not unless you're sent to the "Clinic."
Not unless you're sent to the "Clinic."
You mean if I get sick?
You mean if I get sick?
They don't give two fucks about your health. The Clinic's where they send the real hard-cases for attitude adjustment. Look at O'Neill --
What did he do?
He hit a guard.
Fine work, Jon.
Yeah, real fine. Especially all the casualties.
Yeah, real fine. Especially all the casualties.
I'm complimenting you. Can't you ever just say "thanks"?
I'm complimenting you. Can't you ever just say "thanks"?
... Thanks.
... Thanks.
Try to kiss my butt just once before I'm transferred.

I don't care -- he's manipulating it. That bomb has been built and it's out there, somewhere.
I don't care -- he's manipulating it. That bomb has been built and it's out there, somewhere.
What do you expect us to do -- shut down the city, evacuate two million people on a hunch?
Uh-oh, somebody's in trouble.
Yeah -- me.
Jesus Christ, Castor.
Drive.
Drive.
The last time I took orders from you I ended up with five years probation.
Where am I?
My place.
My place.
You shouldn't have brought me here ... it's dangerous.
You shouldn't have brought me here ... it's dangerous.
Better than you bleeding all over my car upholstery. Trust me, Caz, you won't be here long.
I hear you're a manicurist now -- got your own business and everything. I'm glad you've stayed clean.
Like I had a choice with that anal-retentive Jon Archer rising my ass at the probation hearing. At least he took an interest. You took off without leaving so much as a Post-it.

I'm not the same person you remember.
Perfect fit.
Should be. It's yours.
Nice-looking kid.
Of course he is ... -- He's yours too.
Go on, Adam ... I'm not asking you for anything -- I was never even going to tell you. But hell, I never thought I'd see you again, either.
How old is he?
How old is he?
Five. No one knows you're his father. I thought someone might want to hurt him -- just to hurt you.
Yes ... someone might want to tear him apart -- snuff him out -- for revenge.
You're not holding him right ... Caz ...
And this thing can grow it?
Yes. Pollux bought one along with the original batch. Obviously, he found a way to make more.
Yes. Pollux bought one along with the original batch. Obviously, he found a way to make more.
Why would he need more?

He's your brother, you figure it out. Maybe he made another bomb.

Or reactivated the first one.

Right ... like Jon Archer would ever let that happen.
Hey, bro ...
You're not my brother. The brother I knew would never have been caught by that dumb fuck Archer. At least tell me the bomb is still going off.
You're not my brother. The brother I knew would never have been caught by that dumb fuck Archer. At least tell me the bomb is still going off.
They haven't found it yet -- Listen, Pollux ...
Pollux ...
Shut up.
So?
So? The procnias averano is a South American bird. The flight here was only three hours! And yesterday a European swallow flew by! Where the fuck are we?
What do you mean?
You shoot hoops like a chick, you smoke like a wuss, and -- I don't know -- you're different.
I was in a coma, Pollux. I still feel like shit.
Let me have a look.
Do you know what it is to be in a coma? It fucks up everything -- including your memory! I can't even tell you why Dobbs jumped me yesterday!
You porked his wife the day he was arrested. How could you forget that?

I don't know. Everything's jumbled -- so you're going to have to help me fill in a few blanks.
I don't know. Everything's jumbled -- so you're going to have to help me fill in a few blanks.
A few blanks? Like what?
A few blanks? Like what?
Like ...
Oh, God -- Mom OD'd at County General.
Retching and convulsing while those bastards didn't even try to save her sorry ass. You gave her mouth to mouth -- man -- even then you had some constitution.
Uh -- to kill the doctors?
After that. You promised you'd always take care of me.
After that. You promised you'd always take care of me.
And I bet I've kept that promise ...
And I bet I've kept that promise ...
Only one you've never broken.
That's not the worst part.
What's worse than losing five million bucks?
What's worse than losing five million bucks?
Being stuck in this rat-hole when it blows. Bro, what you built was a work of art. That little fucker belongs in the Smithsonian.
Thanks, Pollux.
For what?
For what?
For being one helluva guy.
For being one helluva guy.
"Thanks?" I guess they really did fuck you up.
Well, you tried. You failed miserably, but you tried.
Everything I say is wrong. I can't talk to her anymore.
Everything I say is wrong. I can't talk to her anymore.
She's only 12. Some day she'll understand that apathy and absence are just special ways of saying "I love you."

It's important.

So is finishing my residency and passing my boards ...
... I was dreaming ...
Something good?

We were back in high school. You wanted to join the sky diving team, but I wouldn't let you.

Were you there to catch me?
Were you there to catch me?
No.
No.
How come?
How come?
I don't know ... Maybe because you've never needed my help.
Five years ... I still can't get it out of my head -- an inch to the left, Matty would still be alive.
And you wouldn't be.
What are you saying? Oh, God -- you're going on assignment again ...
One last time. It's important ...
One last time. It's important ...
You said you'd be here! You promised me -- you promised Jamie! What could be more important than that?

I can't tell you ... except only I can do it.
I can't tell you ... except only I can do it.
You want me to tell you it's okay to leave? Okay, go on! GO!
Is someone there?
Eve, listen carefully. The man you think is your husband -- isn't.
Who is this?
Never mind that! Just take Jamie and get out of that house. Don't tell anyone where you're going -- especially not him -- just GO.

Whoever you are, don't call again.
Whoever you are, don't call again.
Don't hang up ...
I know you -- you're the one who called. You're Castor Troy. You killed my son --
-- I called, but I'm not Castor. I'm your husband.
How did he expect to do that?
An NSA surgeon gave me Castor's face. He handled the transplant, the vocal implant, everything. But somehow Castor came out of his coma -- and killed everyone who knew about the mission. But not before he was transformed into me.
I took it from my fake husband.
Why point it at me? I'm the real thing.
Why point it at me? I'm the real thing.
I don't know that. Maybe Jon's already dead.
I don't know that. Maybe Jon's already dead.
What more proof do you need?
What more proof do you need?
Tell me what happened on April 9th -- 13 years ago.
Christ, Jon! How could you do this to yourself? How could you do this to us? Do you know -- do you know what he did to me ...?
Whatever happened, whatever he did -- I know it's my fault and I know I can never make it up to you --
He freaked out when he thought I had seen this stuff. I think it's a list of cities -- Santiago, Ho Chi Minh City, Nandi ...
Our Pacific Rim stations. These numbers must be bounties. Castor's not wasting any time.

What do you mean?

He's going to kill off our bureau chiefs -- one-by-one.
He's going to kill off our bureau chiefs -- one-by-one.
-- Or maybe all at once. There's a get-together tonight at New St. Marks. For all the bureau chiefs and their families. He's insisted Jamie and I be there too.
You can't go. You can't be anywhere near that place.
Jon, what is it?
Jon, what is it?
The bomb. He's reactivated it. And everyone there is going to die.
The bomb. He's reactivated it. And everyone there is going to die.
Can't we call someone? Admiral Lazarro?
Can't we call someone? Admiral Lazarro?
I know Lazarro -- the first person she'd call is "me." We can't take the chance of tipping Castor off.

Eve ...
How is he?
No life signs at all. He's a turnip.
No life signs at all. He's a turnip.
That's what they always say.
I started wondering -- if you couldn't switch back -- would it make a difference?
Would it?
Would it?
Damn right.
How's Loomis?
Apparently, fine. He's coming into work. That's the good news ...
Apparently, fine. He's coming into work. That's the good news ...
Go on.
Go on.
Castor's still alive -- Technically. He's a turnip, on total life-support ...
We can send in a plant -- try to get Pollux to spill the location.
He'd see that a mile away. The only person he'd talk to about that bomb is his brother. Unfortunately, turnips can't talk.
Which ear was it?
The left, I think. Those surgeons in Witness Protection can fix things nobody's even broken yet.
Jon, this is goddam insane. You can't go through with it. What about Eve?
She doesn't know -- and she never will.
She doesn't know -- and she never will.
You haven't got a chance in hell of fooling Pollux. Castor drinks, smokes and walks around with a 24-hour hard-on. He's nothing like you.

Don't worry. I've done my homework. I'll get Pollux to talk.
Don't worry. I've done my homework. I'll get Pollux to talk.
Either way, come Saturday morning -- I'm pulling you the hell out of there.
Now what?
Call Lazarro. Castor just came out of his coma.
This is it, Jon. For the next 72 hours -- you're on your own.
Just make sure you're there. On time.
How is the "date night" idea going over with Eve?
Like gangbusters, doc. Okay, I missed the last one.
Like gangbusters, doc. Okay, I missed the last one.
You missed the last three, including her birthday. Your wife's gripe sheet.

I've been working night and day. I haven't had time.
You're supposed to make time. When was the last time you told her you love her? When was the last time you two had sex?
One of my informants spotted him -- right here in the city.
I just asked you about making love to your wife, and you started talking about your job.

I'm not hiding in my work, if that's what you're saying.
You said it, Jon, not me.
Jon, I'm getting a little annoyed by your obsessive need to spoil my fun.
And how much will your "fun" net you this time?
What's it to you? I declare it. Here I am, back in the States for less than a month --
You're under arrest. Incredibly, you still have the right to remain silent --

Mention my family once more and you're dead.

You can't kill me, Jon. I've got something going this Saturday night ... it's gonna be worse than anything God ever dumped on the Pharaohs -- and only I can stop it.

You can tell me all about it -- from your prison cell.

-- Castor?
Not anymore.
Not anymore.
It can't be. It's impossible.
It can't be. It's impossible.
I believe the phrase Dr. Hoag used was "titanically remote." Who knows? Maybe the trauma of having my face cut off pulled me out. Or maybe God really is on my side after all. By the way, I know you don't get the papers in here.
You killed them?
Of course I killed them, you DUMB FUCK. And torched every shred of evidence that proves who you really are. Swallow this one, Commander. You are going to be in here for the rest of your life.

What are you going to do, Castor?
What are you going to do, Castor?
Let's not confuse things anymore. I'm Archer. You're Castor. But if you need proof --
What are you going to do!
You've given me the freedom I haven't had in years, and the power to make it pay off in ways I never thought possible. But hell -- this is America. One day a pauper, the next day, a prince. And I owe it all to you. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got an important government job to abuse, -- and a beautiful wife
Stay away from my family!
Too late, your kid worships me. And your wife -- she's an animal. Even I can't keep up with her.
What -- what are you doing?
Vacuum-sealed globe ... shouldn't take long.
I don't know. How long before it kills us?
Five seconds.
Give up, Castor. People are going to find out.
Not if I kill you first ...
Jamie ...
Shoot him!
They're too tight.
So's a noose. Now keep your mouth SHUT.
You'll what?
I'm going to have you fired.
You better be nice, Castor. You could get mighty lonely now that Pollux is gone.
Pollux is -- what?
Pollux is -- what?
Archer cut him a deal for turning state's evidence. He's free.

Or what? You'll have me fired?
SFPD? Castor isn't stupid enough to come back to the city.
Trust me, he's already here. Get going!
We've got him sighted. Okay, Pollux, pull out.
What makes you so sure this guy's gonna set up his own brother?
What makes you so sure this guy's gonna set up his own brother?
I've never been more certain of anything. Get everyone in position. -- And get the word out -- shoot to kill.
Just saving the tax-payers the cost of a trial. So take a hike.
What's the matter with your voice, Commander?
What's the matter with your voice, Commander?
Castor Troy almost strangled me to death. Where the hell were you?
Screw your boundaries, Janie. You have something I want.
Janie?
Clarissa left those here.
I won't tell mom if you don't.
I won't tell mom if you don't.
When did you start smoking?
When did you start smoking?
You'll be seeing a lot of changes around here. Daddy's a new man.
Get a higher arc on the ball, Jamie. And for Chrissake, square your shoulders to the basket.
Like you know anything about it.
What are you -- stupid?
You haven't changed at all! Some guy tries to rape me -- and you side with him!
You haven't changed at all! Some guy tries to rape me -- and you side with him!

There's my little darling. The night wouldn't be complete without you.
Yeah, mom cut me some slack -- but I decided ... I'd like to be here for you. Here, mom. You can have it back. Thanks, though.
Oh -- Commander. I didn't see you ...
Well, I saw you -- Kim.
Well, I saw you -- Kim.
Kim?
Kim?
That's your name, isn't it?
That's your name, isn't it?
You always call me Miss Brewster.

Let's try to be a little less formal from now on, shall we?
You've got someone in your office.
Get rid of them.
Get rid of them.
The Admiral?
You picked a helluva day to leave your beeper off!
What happened?
What happened?
Castor's escaped!
Castor's escaped!
Escaped? From Erewhon? I want everyone on this -- our entire force and the SFPD.
What happened?
What the fuck do you think happened? Castor Troy just shot him! What are you waiting for? GO!
Commander, what are you doing here?
Where should I be? Where's everyone else?
Where should I be? Where's everyone else?
Backing you up! Didn't you track Castor to the Army Street Terminal?

What?
What?
It was confirmed by your personal security code. Nobody knows that code but you!
It was confirmed by your personal security code. Nobody knows that code but you!
Obviously someone else knows it! Get everybody back to their posts -- NOW!
You're both in custody until there's a DNA fingerprinting and we can prove who's who. Now put the gun down.
You can't blame me for trying.
You merciless bastard!
Business first. I went into the "Warrants" system and erased your records. You're clean. In fact, you're now on the informant payroll.
I can't even look at you without wanting to vomit.
You better get used to it. That bitch Lazarro is getting kicked upstairs. Guess what white-bread family man is going to replace her?
-- I'll be one of the most powerful men in the country. Didn't matter how much cash I made pulling wet jobs -- I was still too low on the food chain -- always with somebody like Jon Archer after me. The best part is -- I'm the GOOD guy.
No -- the best part is, since it's a government job -- they can't fire you! But how can you be sure you'll get the appointment?
No -- the best part is, since it's a government job -- they can't fire you! But how can you be sure you'll get the appointment?
Trust me. You're gonna love it ...
Don't get mad, but I just went for a little stroll through the company switches.
You're supposed to be snitching, making me look legit.
You're supposed to be snitching, making me look legit.
Don't worry, nobody knows I'm inside. Check it out. Remember that fat fuck agent who roughed us up in Thailand? He's being treated for bone cancer at the V.A. Thanks to the miracle of NSA grid-technology ... -- Ooops! His radiation does just quadrupled.

Eight pocket stingers ... seven piper uzis ... six cobra carbines ... five - net - launch-ers ...
Yeah -- it's Santa's Magic fucking Village. Your present's in here.
We gut the organization -- and rebuild it with more reliable friends.
Most of the current chiefs -- they must have pretty hefty prices on their heads.

Good, because I checked your salary -- and it bites. How the everyday working-class stiff survives in today's economy is something I'll never ...

No problem.
What about me?
A lot of people think you're a snitch. It's dangerous ...

Look at you, Jon -- at your age -- an American hero! I'd buy you a drink but I know you'd just turn me down.
Normally, I would. But today ...
You're the only person in this place who can see right through me.
You've made us look pretty good in the past week. And the way you handled the press --

Me. I have doubts about your ability to stick with what is essentially a desk job.
Me. I have doubts about your ability to stick with what is essentially a desk job.
I had doubts too. I always looked at a desk as though it were a ball-and-chain. But something happened ...
You'd have to start immediately.
Done. In fact, I was already plotting about the best way to meet the foreign bureau chiefs.
Done. In fact, I was already plotting about the best way to meet the foreign bureau chiefs.
Jon, you're starting to remind me -- of me. Congratulations.
I just heard about Castor's fratricide -- rather poetic, don't you think?
What is it, Admiral? I'm under the gun here.
What is it, Admiral? I'm under the gun here.
I just thought that -- under the circumstances -- you might want to postpone the meeting with the station chiefs.

Okay, then. I leave it in your able hands.
What happened to your big "assignment"?
What do you know about it?

As much as ever. Nothing.

It didn't work out as planned. Where are you off to?

What is with you tonight?
Don't I usually kiss my wife?
Don't I usually kiss my wife?
No.
Hurry up -- the salad's getting warm and the pasta's getting cold.
-- I've got to study.
Why do I feel like I'm on a blind date?
They say love is blind. Do you think that's true?
I think -- you're trying to get me drunk.
Wouldn't be the first time -- or would it?
Wouldn't be the first time -- or would it?
You wouldn't even sip champagne at our wedding. We were underage -- you wouldn't break the law. Remember what my brother called you?
So -- how long will you be gone this time?
Gone?
Gone?
Isn't that what all this is about? Letting Jamie go out, cooking me dinner, -- your next assignment?

You always say that -- then you leave.

Can't you see I'm trying to change? I sent Jamie off because I wanted to be alone with you. I wanted to see the candle-light dance in your beautiful --
-- what?
I'm replacing Lazarro. Nice, safe desk job -- just like you wanted.
I'm replacing Lazarro. Nice, safe desk job -- just like you wanted.
... That's great.
... That's great.
So you see, I'm not going anywhere. Unless it's upstairs with you ...
You're wearing your suit --
Call me spontaneous.
What's on your mind?
Jon, it's the tenth. I know how difficult it is for you, but we still have to go.

Okay, if you insist. But -- you drive.
I think Jamie's been seeing Karl again.
Great.
Great.
Great? He's 17 -- you told her to stay away from him.
Great? He's 17 -- you told her to stay away from him.
Oh, that Karl.
Oh, that Karl.
Yes, Jon. That Karl.
Yes, Jon. That Karl.
I'll have a talk with her. By the way, you never said anything about last night ...
What are you doing?
-- Studying.
Nothing.
I disagree. You think I've been acting strange. Like a completely different person.
I disagree. You think I've been acting strange. Like a completely different person.
-- Yes.
-- Yes.
Okay, I have a confession to make. But you aren't going to like it.
Where's Jamie?
That's what I'd like to know. She stole fifty dollars from my purse and took off.
I'll deal with her later.
Good. Because I'm fed up.
I'm going to the powder room.
Sure, baby -- go anywhere you want. But I have to give you an escort. Security reasons.
Remember this from our junior prom? Boy, were you ever mad for Madonna.
Back then -- who wasn't?
Back then -- who wasn't?
Wait a second -- you hated Madonna. Didn't you?
You too? This holiday's about giving, Adelle. And I'm giving everything I've got to this deal, so in a way, I'm more Christmassy than anyone... Lifesaver?
You're a ray of sunshine, Jack.
Oh, and Oxxford called...
Ooh, my suits are ready...
Kate Reynolds...
Her assistant said you could call her at home after eight.
Her assistant?
Yeah Jack, her assistant...
Yeah Jack, her assistant...
Kate Reynolds was my girlfriend in college. I almost married her...
Kate Reynolds was my girlfriend in college. I almost married her...
You? Married?
You? Married?
Almost married. And almost a junior broker at E.F. Hutton...
Almost married. And almost a junior broker at E.F. Hutton...
Excuse me?
Excuse me?
She didn't want me to go to London. We're standing at the airport saying goodbye and she asks me to stay.
She didn't want me to go to London. We're standing at the airport saying goodbye and she asks me to stay.
So you left her? Just like that?
So you left her? Just like that?
God, no. I thought about it for practically the entire flight...
God, no. I thought about it for practically the entire flight...
Stop Jack, I'm getting all weepy.
Stop Jack, I'm getting all weepy.
I took the road less traveled, Adelle.
I took the road less traveled, Adelle.
And look where it's led you... I'm gonna get her on the phone...
No...
No?! You almost married this woman. Aren't you even curious what she wants?
No?! You almost married this woman. Aren't you even curious what she wants?
She's probably just having a fit of nostalgia. You know, lonely Christmas Eve, call the one that got away, that kind of thing.
I'll leave from the office tomorrow afternoon. Call the group. Schedule an emergency strategy session for noon.
That'll be a nice little holiday treat.
Hello?
Hey Santa, where are you? Everybodys here.
Hey Santa, where are you? Everybodys here.
Adelle?
Adelle?
You were supposed to be here half an hour ago...the emergency strategy session? Your trip to Aspen? Theyre all panicked here...
Sorry, Jack. I told Dee and the kids I'd be home by dinner. You know, it being Christmas Eve and all.
Is that tonight?
You think I like being here on Christmas Eve, Alan?
I don't know. Maybe...
You're right, Jack. Sorry... Jack approaches Alan.
I don't want you to be sorry, Alan, I want you to be excited. I want my gift to be the first one you open this year. You know why?
I don't want you to be sorry, Alan, I want you to be excited. I want my gift to be the first one you open this year. You know why?
Why Jack?
Why Jack?
Because my gift comes with ten zeroes at the end...
Mr. Mintz.
Please, call me Alan. We try to cultivate a casual atmosphere around here...
Please, call me Alan. We try to cultivate a casual atmosphere around here...
I can see that, Alan.
You have kids, Jack?
Uh...actually, yes. Two... good ones.
I was a sales associate, at E.F. Hutton.
A broker? Really. And now youre in the tire business?
A broker? Really. And now youre in the tire business?
Thats right. And auto supply...
Thats right. And auto supply...
Uh huh. The retail end, I understand.
Uh...we actually get about sixty percent of our business from automotive service.
Mind if I ask what kind of sales you did last year? Ballpark...
Mind if I ask what kind of sales you did last year? Ballpark...
We did one point seven million in total revenue...
We did one point seven million in total revenue...
Uh huh...one point seven. And what do you project for this year?
Well, Alan, I think were gonna have a banner year. Sales are up almost twenty percent in the first quarter and we just landed a major trucking company account.
Really. So youre projecting what, a tad over two million?
Look, I know our paltry little two million in sales is about what you spend on office supplies in a year. And I know some regional trucking company account is nothing compared to a sixty billion dollar merger...
Im not trying to knock the tire business, Jack.
Im not trying to knock the tire business, Jack.
Its okay, Alan. I get it. Im in your shoes, Im thinking exactly the same thing...but heres the thing. Business is business. Wall Street, Main Street, its all just a bunch of people getting up in the morning, trying to figure out how the hell theyre gonna send their kids to college. Its just people...
And I know people.
Im sure you do...
Take you, for instance...
What about me?
What about me?
You drink about sixteen Diet Cokes a day. Youre an excellent father, but you feel guilty about the time you spend away from home. You drink bourbon, but you offer your clients scotch...
...thats our war room. We did seven major deals last year, three of them hostile.
Seven. Really.
Good for you. Why shouldnt you protect whats yours.
I dont think youre hearing me.
I dont think youre hearing me.
Oh, Im hearing you, Alan. Thats not the problem. The problem is that what you think is yours, is really mine. And I dont care how low on the totem pole I start, I will get it back... So do yourself a favor and dont get too attached to that view because sometime soon, maybe very soon, you and your French country antiques, your
Jack, are you okay?
Whats going on here?
Whats going on here?
Its not good. Bob Thomas has secretly been talking to a European drug company. Were not sure which one, Julias on it right now. Word is theyre willing to let him buy a minority stake and keep running the entire company. The Global people are up in arms. They say we shouldve been prepared for this. Were in trouble here, Jack...
Excuse me?
But I think I like you better this way...
But I think I like you better this way...
Is this another one of those Sun Tzu Art of War tricks?
No.
So what are we gonna do, Jack?
Rise...and...shine...!
Youre jumping, sweetheart...
Mom, dont you think we need to open the presents?
Mommy needs five more minutes in la la land. That could be her present...
Were almost done here...
Mary Janes, Mom. You promised.
Mary Janes, Mom. You promised.
Thats right. Okay, lets make a quick stop at the kids shoe department, pick up my watch from the battery place, then Ill run into the linen store...
Fightings a part of it, Annie. You know that, right?
Im not worried, Mom. Hes still learning our ways...
This isnt my real life. Its just a glimpse...
Wheres my real dad?
Wheres my real dad?
I dont know...
They did a pretty good job.
Who did?
Who did?
The aliens...In the mother ship. You look just like him.
The aliens...In the mother ship. You look just like him.
Uhh...thanks...slightly better looking though, right?
Do you like kids?
On a case by case basis...
On a case by case basis...
You know how to make chocolate milk?
You know how to make chocolate milk?
I think I could figure it out.

You promise not to kidnap me and my brother and implant stuff in our brains?
You promise not to kidnap me and my brother and implant stuff in our brains?
Sure.
This is day care. Its where babies go when their parents are at work.
Check...
I have winter camp until four, then ballet until five thirty.
Five thirty. Okay.
Five thirty. Okay.
Try not to be late because kids dont like to be the last one picked up.
Try not to be late because kids dont like to be the last one picked up.
Got it. Good tip.
Got it. Good tip.
Bye...
Where do I go now?
Big Eds.
Big Eds.
Big Eds? Big Eds Tires? Why...?
Big Eds? Big Eds Tires? Why...?
Thats where you work.
Not bad...I shoulda warned you. Dad always does something really special for their anniversary.
Like what?
Like what?
One year he had a solar system named after her...
One year he had a solar system named after her...
Dont you think thats a little gimmicky?
Dont you think thats a little gimmicky?
Mom liked it.
Maybe theres a jewelry store back at the mall. I could get her a pair of earrings or something.
Thats good but...you did forget the anniversary.
Thats good but...you did forget the anniversary.
Right. Thats a major oversight... So if Im Kate...I cant really afford the finer things, my husbands career is a crushing disappointment to me, Im trapped in suburbia...
Very nice. What is it?
Mary Had A Little Lamb.
Mary Had A Little Lamb.
Ah. A classic...
What are you doing?
Ringing my bell...
Is it morning yet?
No, honey. Go back to sleep.
I know, I moved the Barca-lounger into the corner. Its throwin everybody off. What do you think?
Great room...
Were friends, arent we?
Maybe I dont say it enough but you moving in next door to me...
Im having kind of a bad day.
I read somewhere that the suicide rate doubles during the holidays...
What am I saying? You dont need to hear that... All I meant was a lot of people have a hard time dealing with all the forced reverie, thats all. Is that you?
Is it...?
Is it...?
Trouble at work?
Trouble at work?
I dont think so.
I dont think so.
Its not Kate, is it?
You see, its like were in each others heads...
Kates my wife...
Look, you fit the profile exactly. Thirties, house, kids, financial responsibilities. You start thinking...this isnt the life I dreamt about. Wheres the romance, wheres the joie de vivre? Suddenly, every lingerie ad in the Newark Star Ledger represents a life you cant have...
Its just two kids, right?
Damn...
Jesus, Jack, this is a league match, for gods sake!
Wheres your follow through? Wheres your stance?
Hey, Im doing the best I can... Id like to see you hit a squash ball after seventeen beers...
Hey, Im doing the best I can... Id like to see you hit a squash ball after seventeen beers...
Youre right. Why am I so competitive!? Compensation, I guess. Look, just focus, Jack. You can still pick up the spare...
Hey Jack, youre all flush. I guess that seventy-one took a lot outta you.
I just saw Evelyn Thompson.
I just saw Evelyn Thompson.
She is relentless.
She is relentless.
She wants to have an affair with me.
She wants to have an affair with me.
She said that?
She said that?
Pretty much.
Pretty much.
Oh yeah... What is it about you?
Oh yeah... What is it about you?
So could you write down her exact address?
So could you write down her exact address?
Whoa...whoa...wait a second, Jack. Youre not actually gonna cheat on Kate?
Whoa...whoa...wait a second, Jack. Youre not actually gonna cheat on Kate?
It wouldnt really be cheating... Its complicated.
It wouldnt really be cheating... Its complicated.
Look, maybe Im not as good a consigliere as you are but you have to trust me on this one. A little flirtations harmless but youre playing with fire here. The Fidelity Bank and Trust is a tough creditor. You make a deposit somewhere else, they close your account forever.

Im telling you, those rules dont apply to me, Arn.
Im telling you, those rules dont apply to me, Arn.
Screw the rules. Im talking about the choice.
Cmon, Evelyn Thompsons got no class. She doesnt marry Dr. Steve, the womans living in a trailer.
Hey, is that really necessary?
Hey, is that really necessary?
All Im saying it there isnt a guy in Union County who wouldnt give his left nut to be married to Kate...
So Jack, its your wifes birthday, got anything to say to her?
Its your birthday? Today? Whats your name? Where were you born?
Hey, you cant park that thing here.
Its me, Jack...
Its me, Jack...
I dont care if youre Tim Allen with your fancy car and all your tools, you still cant park here.
I dont care if youre Tim Allen with your fancy car and all your tools, you still cant park here.
Tell me you recognize me, Arnie. Please...
Tell me you recognize me, Arnie. Please...
Howd you know my name?
Howd you know my name?
We bowl together. Were bowlers ...we won a championship...were winners.
We bowl together. Were bowlers ...we won a championship...were winners.
I never won anything in bowling.
Wait a second... Jack...Jack...
Yes...Jack Campbell...
Yes...Jack Campbell...
Of course. Jack Campbell. I went to high school with you...you played baseball, right? Youre doing well...
Of course. Jack Campbell. I went to high school with you...you played baseball, right? Youre doing well...
Yes, thats it...yes, we went to high school together.
Yes, thats it...yes, we went to high school together.
You never really talked to me. I wanted to talk to you, man...
You never really talked to me. I wanted to talk to you, man...
Yeah...I guess I just wanted you to know, we couldve been really good friends...
Wheres my car?! Wheres my Ferrari!?
What the hell are you talking about? Whats he talking about?
What the hell are you talking about? Whats he talking about?
Look, can I just borrow your car?! I promise itll be returned!
Look, can I just borrow your car?! I promise itll be returned!
The Caddy? Why dont you take your own damn car!
Got a minute, Jack?
Ive got all the time in the world...
Cmon Jack...
I mean it. From what I can tell, were a mom and pop operation, were already over-extended in sales, and any price advantage we could offer would easily be matched by a larger supplier...
DO YOU WANNA DIE?!
No.
No.
Yes you do...
Yes you do...
Look, I'm talking about a business deal here. I buy the ticket for two hundred, take it to a store where the guy behind the counter... ...doesn't have a death wish ...I just made myself a quick thirty eight dollars.
Like I said, it's a business deal...
Damn, you are the real thing...
How'd you know my name was Jack?
I call all you white guys "Jack."
You know you seem pretty relaxed for a guy who just had a gun pulled on him.
There's no way I was gonna die in that deli... Let's just say I've been on a lucky streak lately.
There's no way I was gonna die in that deli... Let's just say I've been on a lucky streak lately.
A lucky streak, huh?
So you're telling me, you've got a gun to your head and you don't think for one second, what if this, what if that, maybe I shouldn't do this, I shoulda done that.
I don't do that. That's just not for me...
Okay, Jack. Nice doing business with you... Cash is about to take off...
Hey...
What do you want to carry that gun around for, anyway? You're just gonna do something you'll regret...
You want to talk about regrets, you're talking to the wrong person.
I'm just saying that you seem like a smart guy. At a certain point you're gonna do something, and then there's no turning back...
Yeah, in most cases that'd be true.
I mean there must be programs out there, opportunities...
Wait a minute, wait a minute... you're tryin' to save me?
Oh man, you're serious... This man thinks I need to be saved!
Everyone needs something.
Yeah? What do you need?
Me?
Me?
You just said everyone needs something.
You just said everyone needs something.
I've got everything I need.
I've got everything I need.
Wow. It must be great being you. You got it all.
Look, I'm not saying you'd be able to do it without some hard work...
You still think this is about me, don't you?
You still think this is about me, don't you?
Sure it's about you. But it's about society, too.
Sure it's about you. But it's about society, too.
Oh man, I'm gonna enjoy this one... Just remember, Jack, you did this. You brought this on yourself...
Miss me, Jack?
Thats my car! You stole my car!
Thats my car! You stole my car!
Its a callable asset seized in accordance with the acquisition by-laws of your alt-fate contract...
Its a callable asset seized in accordance with the acquisition by-laws of your alt-fate contract...
What?!
What?!
Basically, its my car now. Get in.
Might wanna fasten your seat belt, Jack...
What the hell is happening to me?!
Look, I dont know what youre getting so worked up about, you did this...you brought this on yourself.
Brought what on myself?! I didnt do anything!
Brought what on myself?! I didnt do anything!
No? Cmon, Jack...Ive got everything I need, I dont have regrets, thats just not for me... sound familiar?
No? Cmon, Jack...Ive got everything I need, I dont have regrets, thats just not for me... sound familiar?
You mean because you thought I was cocky Im now on a permanent acid trip?!!
Everyone else in that store is a statue, they see their lives passing in front of their eyes, but not you. Youre making a business deal...
Give me my goddamn life back!
Give me my goddamn life back!
You? What about me? Im working hard for you here, Jack. On Christmas too! Now you did a good thing last night, intervening that way. I was moved...
You? What about me? Im working hard for you here, Jack. On Christmas too! Now you did a good thing last night, intervening that way. I was moved...
Please. Just tell me whats happening to me. In plain English. None of that mumbo jumbo...
Its a glimpse, Jacko.
I glimpse? A glimpse of what!? What glimpse?! Glimpse!
I glimpse? A glimpse of what!? What glimpse?! Glimpse!
Look, eventually, everybody gets one...some of em take a couple seconds... ...some of em take a lot longer...
Look, eventually, everybody gets one...some of em take a couple seconds... ...some of em take a lot longer...
I asked you a direct question! A glimpse of what?!
Figure it out. You got plenty of time.
How much time?!
How much time?!
As long as it takes to figure it out. Which, in your case, could be considerable.
As long as it takes to figure it out. Which, in your case, could be considerable.
Look, I just want my life back. Now whats it gonna take? You wanna talk turkey? Lets talk turkey! How much money...?
Do I look like I need your money. It doesnt work like that and I cant tell you why.
Why not?
Why not?
Because you got to figure it out for yourself. Are you listening to me?
Because you got to figure it out for yourself. Are you listening to me?
Figure it out? Figure what out?!
Thats it? Thats all I get?! A glare?!
Look Jack, in my experience the best way people deal with this is to just relax and breathe through it...let it come to you.
Whats this, a signal? Will you come whenever I ring it?
Do I look like I live in a bottle?
But what do I do?
Look Jack Im late. Id love to help you out some more but I gotta go handle my business... Happy trails.
You cant do this. You cant keep coming in and out of peoples lives, messing things up...
Cmon, Jack...
Ive got kids, Im going home...
You know what the word glimpse means, J? Its by nature an impermanent thing.
...06...14...18...48...right there. Four numbers...that's two hundred and thirty eight dollar... Merry Christmas and shit...
Ticket bad. You draw in lines with pencil.
Ticket bad. You draw in lines with pencil.
What're you talkin' about?
What're you talkin' about?
You draw lines with pencil! I know about this!
What!? Look at the ticket...!
Get out, I call 911.
You leave now. Take ticket somewhere else. Next customer in line...!

Get out!
Like the dress...?
Its lovely...
Its lovely...
I thought I saw you notice it at the kids recital.
Finger food...?
I dont think so, thank you...
I dont think so, thank you...
Cmon, as soon as I put them down, youre gonna grab a couple...you always do...
Mushroom puffs arent the only thing I do well...
Well do whatever it is you do well, and just...just do it. Excuse me...
Evelyn, right?
Very funny. I saw you out there on lane five. What do you have the flu or something?
Very funny. I saw you out there on lane five. What do you have the flu or something?
Something like that.
Something like that.
Need a nurse?
Need a nurse?
Youre a nurse?
Are we...?
Are we what, Jack?
Are we what, Jack?
Is there something going on between us?
Are we finally being honest?
It would help me if we were.
It would help me if we were.
Okay, youre right, weve been dancing around this for years...
I'm thinking I might walk tonight, Frank.
Nice night for it. I'll have Louis send your car home.
Merry Christmas to you, sir...
Thanks. To you too...
Whoa, whoa, whoa...hold it right there...
Frank. Wheres Alan Mintz? Is he here yet?

I dont care who you are. Its Christmas and like I told you the building is closed.
I dont care who you are. Its Christmas and like I told you the building is closed.
Maybe youre not hearing me. I am Jack Campbell... Right here. Jack Campbell, President...
Do I have a private office somewhere in the building?
Uh...sure Jack... Right back there...
Uh...sure Jack... Right back there...
Thank you.
...I was the number one junior sales associate at E.F. Hutton in 1988. Did you know that?
No, I didnt...thats great.
No, I didnt...thats great.
Thats the kind of thing you can really build on...
Thats the kind of thing you can really build on...
Uh huh...
Uh huh...
I mean sales has always been a feeder for M and A, always...
Here we are, mag wheels... Hey Jack, are you sure youre okay?
Well, Im just a little confused right now about why I work here...
Kates on two, Jack. Nice ride...
If youre into that kind of conspicuous consumption...
If youre into that kind of conspicuous consumption...
You want me to handle him? I think Im ready...
Why dont you let me take this one, Kenny?
Okay, chief.
Merry Christmas, Mr. Campbell.
Howd you do this year, Tony?
Howd you do this year, Tony?
About four grand. And a bottle of twenty five year old scotch from Mrs. Johnson in 9D. Im putting it all in commercial paper like you said.
About four grand. And a bottle of twenty five year old scotch from Mrs. Johnson in 9D. Im putting it all in commercial paper like you said.
Just until the Deutsche Mark turns...
Sorry, pal. Entrance is for residents and guests only...
What are you talking about? Its me, Jack Campbell. Penthouse C. I put you into commercial paper!
What are you talking about? Its me, Jack Campbell. Penthouse C. I put you into commercial paper!
Uh-huh...
Every one of these songs will remind you of me in a slightly different way...
All in one tape?
All in one tape?
I also put side two of London Calling on there...
I have a bad feeling about this.
About the plane? What do you think its gonna crash? Dont say that...
About the plane? What do you think its gonna crash? Dont say that...
I know weve talked about this a thousand times and we both agree that going to London is the right thing to do. But in my heart... this feels wrong.
Dont go, Jack...
You mean dont go at all? What about my internship?
You mean dont go at all? What about my internship?
Believe me I know what an incredible opportunity this is for you...
Believe me I know what an incredible opportunity this is for you...
For us, Kate.
For us, Kate.
Right, for us. But...Im afraid that if you get on that plane...
Right, for us. But...Im afraid that if you get on that plane...
What?
Go. Im sorry, you should just go...
No, youre right. What are we doing?
No, youre right. What are we doing?
We're being responsible. Go. Get on the plane.
I can't seem to let go of you...
You hear me complaining about that?
Are you okay?
Yeah...fine.
What kind of man does that!?
I dont know! Please stop yelling at me!
Where were you?
I was in the city.
I was in the city.
The city? New York City? Why?
The city? New York City? Why?
Because thats where I live.
Because thats where I live.
Jack...dont even start...
Jack...dont even start...
Look, you dont understand. I woke up here...and this is very strange ...this is not my house...
Look, we dont have time for this right now, well talk about it later. Now get dressed... Youre not wearing that to the Thompsons party. I dont care how hilarious you think it is...
Party? Oh no, I cant go to a party...
Party? Oh no, I cant go to a party...
You look forward to this party all year. Whats with you today?
You look forward to this party all year. Whats with you today?
Trust me on this Kate. I really dont think going to a party is the right move for me at the present time.
What are you doing?
Telling my mother she doesnt have to stay with the kids.
Telling my mother she doesnt have to stay with the kids.
Why not?
Why not?
Because youll be here.
Christ... Where the hell is the bathroom?
Funny, Jack. Im laughing on the inside.
Yes, Im fine. Its just this god awful football phone! Who has a phone like this anyway?!
Uh huh...
Jack...
Pro bono. You dont get paid at all. Nobody makes a dime. Well, bravo...
Here you go...
Youre kidding me...
Youre kidding me...
Shes your dog, Jack.
Shes your dog, Jack.
No, shes not.
No, shes not.
Fine, shes the kids dog. Lets go wake Josh, see if he wants to walk her.
Fine, shes the kids dog. Lets go wake Josh, see if he wants to walk her.
But its twenty degrees outside...
But its twenty degrees outside...
Youre having a bad day, Ill go with you...actually, theres no way in hell youre gettin me back out there...
Hello!
...my feet are hurtin...
...my feet are hurtin...
HEY!
Uh...that babys crying...
And...?
Jack. I said the kids are asleep...
Well thats just great...those little monkeys can be a real handful...
Hey! I was watching that!
I thought we had a deal about you watching CNBC in bed.
I thought we had a deal about you watching CNBC in bed.
Im working on a new deal now...
Wait a second. You want me, dont you?
That is the general idea, yes...
Shouldnt we grab some dinner first? Maybe a bottle of wine...?
Its ten thirty, Jack. By eleven youre gonna be sprawled out on the bed snoring your head off. We dont have time for wining and dining.
Its ten thirty, Jack. By eleven youre gonna be sprawled out on the bed snoring your head off. We dont have time for wining and dining.
Whatever you say...honey.
Thanks, Jack...
No, Im serious...youre really stunning...
No, Im serious...youre really stunning...
This is good stuff, Jack, keep it coming...
This is good stuff, Jack, keep it coming...
I mean back in college, you were a very pretty girl, theres no question about that. But this... ...youve really grown into a beautiful woman...
How can you do that?
Do what?
Do what?
Look at me like you havent seen me every day for the last twelve years...
I mean...wow...off the charts great.
Its an unbelievable thing. Wearing this suit actually makes me feel like a better person. Im gonna buy it...
$2,400?! Are you out of your mind?
She got those shoes...
She got those shoes...
Those shoes were twenty five dollars. Cmon, take it off. Well go to the food court and get one of those funnel cakes you like.
No?
Do you have any idea what my life is like?
Do you have any idea what my life is like?
Excuse me?
Excuse me?
I wake up in the morning covered in dog saliva...I drop the kids off, spend eight hours selling tires retail...retail, Kate.
I pick up the kids, walk the dog, which by the way, carries the added bonus of carting away her monstrous crap...I play with the kids, take out the garbage, get six hours of sleep if Im lucky, and then it starts all over again...and why is it that I always have to drive everyone everywhere? I spend practically my entire day in that
Really.
Really.
Whats in it for me? Where are my Mary Janes?
Its sad to hear your life is such a disappointment to you, Jack.
I cant believe its not a disappointment to you! Jesus, Kate, I couldve been a thousand times the man I became. How could you do this to me? How could you let me give up on my dreams like this?!
Look, Im sorry. Im sorry I was such a saint before and Im such a prick now. Maybe Im just not the same guy I was when we got married...
Maybe youre not. The Jack Campbell I married wouldnt need a $2400 suit to make himself feel better about his life, but if thats what its gonna take, then buy it. Just buy the goddamn suit ...we can take the money out of the kids college fund.
Well...Annie for one.
Surprise. Were pregnant... Yeah...that mustve been...I mean that was very unexpected. But what are you gonna do, right?
Surprise. Were pregnant... Yeah...that mustve been...I mean that was very unexpected. But what are you gonna do, right?
I think it worked out okay, dont you?
I think it worked out okay, dont you?
Sure. I really like Annie.
Sure. I really like Annie.
Good, Jack. Maybe well keep her.
Good, Jack. Maybe well keep her.
No, I love Annie. We had a lot of good times, didnt we?
No, I love Annie. We had a lot of good times, didnt we?
We were young... Remember that little place on Charles Street we used to go to?
We were young... Remember that little place on Charles Street we used to go to?
Charles Street? In the Village? When we were living in Greenwich Village...? Great times. Whyd we ever leave?
Charles Street? In the Village? When we were living in Greenwich Village...? Great times. Whyd we ever leave?
You cant really raise a kid in an apartment in the Village...
The trek out to the hospital every day didnt help either... You were great. Surviving the heart attack was one thing...
You had a heart attack?
You had a heart attack?
Jack, stop that. I'm still mad at you... ...who knows what wouldve happened if you hadnt stepped in at the store.
Jack, stop that. I'm still mad at you... ...who knows what wouldve happened if you hadnt stepped in at the store.
Thats why I work for Big Ed?
Our life in a nutshell...
If you want to look at it that way...
If you want to look at it that way...
How would you look at it?
How was the game, honey?
Long, boring, and generally pretty sad. Arnie seemed to enjoy it... Hey, wheres that chocolate cake...?
You mean this chocolate cake?
Thats my piece. I was saving it because I got nauseated from that store bought chicken.
Cmon.
Sorry, Jack. Its too important to me.
You want the cake!?
I want it...
Thank you...
Its good, right?
Say it, Jack...
What...?
What...?
Cmon, you know what I like to hear...
Cmon, you know what I like to hear...
Yeah, baby, I know what you like to hear...
Yeah, baby, I know what you like to hear...
Then say it...just say it to me...!
Then say it...just say it to me...!
Oh yeah, youre a bad girl, baby... You make me so hot...Im gonna take you to that special place...
Not it...?
Nice, Jack. Youre sweeping me off my feet.
Nice, Jack. Youre sweeping me off my feet.
What? You make me hot...
Jack.
Wait a minute. Youre my wife?
Maybe I should wait...
No, open it...
I found it at an outlet store. I know its a knock-off, but I think itll look great on you...
Zeena...
You really are incredible...
Enjoy it, sweetheart...
Heres the thing. I really hadnt planned on giving you your...uh... anniversary gift until tonight. You know, anniversarys good all day...
What are you talking about? You never wait all day. You can barely wait until its light out.
What are you talking about? You never wait all day. You can barely wait until its light out.
I know that, but...
You actually forgot our anniversary.
Ill fix it. Ill go out right now and get you something. Ill make it right.
Jack...can we afford all this?
Whats the difference? Im taking my baby out for our anniversary, damn the costs...
Whats the difference? Im taking my baby out for our anniversary, damn the costs...
How do you even know about this place?
You are so not off the hook yet, slick.
But Im gettin close, right?
I need to tell you something.
Okay...
Okay...
I think it may help us but theres a slight chance it could make things worse.
Now Im worried...just say it. Whatever it is well deal with it.
Are you sure?
I used to be so sure about everything, you know? I knew exactly who I was and what I wanted. Then one morning I woke up and suddenly it was all different...
Worse, you mean...
Worse, you mean...
No. Well, maybe a few things. But mostly just different...
I never used to be like this, Kate. I had it all figured out. No doubts, no regrets.
And now...?
And now...?
Now...I dont...
I think its good to be a little unsure about who you are. Its very human.
But you always seem so certain.
But you always seem so certain.
Cmon, Jack, you think there arent mornings when I wake up and wonder what the hell Im doing in New Jersey...
Cmon, Jack, you think there arent mornings when I wake up and wonder what the hell Im doing in New Jersey...
Thats a big one for me, too.
Thats a big one for me, too.
My office is a dump, I answer my own phone...and youve seen my pay check.
My office is a dump, I answer my own phone...and youve seen my pay check.
Your pay check is a disgrace to pay checks.
Your pay check is a disgrace to pay checks.
I mean yes, I help people that need it...

I guess...some of them are probably faking.
I guess...some of them are probably faking.
God, sometimes I think it would be so nice not to have to stretch ground beef or maybe drive a car with a CD player...
Imagine having a life where everything was easy...where you asked for things and people just brought them to you...
Its wonderful...
Good things...
What are you sure about?
You know champagne makes me do crazy things.
Ill just full yours up to the top. Happy anniversary, sweetheart.
I dont know how you did it, hoss, but you pulled it off.
Im out of the doghouse?
Im out of the doghouse?
Way out...
Youre so...beautiful...
I already told you you were gonna get lucky, Jack...
My god, all this time...I never stopped loving you...
Thats all I wanted to hear...
I could stay here forever...
I dont think Id fight you on that one...
Pretty incredible, isnt it?
Its like a museum.
So whats the big surprise? You didnt rent this place for the weekend, did you?
Think bigger.
Think bigger.
For the week?
This place is a perk, Kate.
A perk for what?
A perk for what?
A company called P.K. Lassiter and Associates Investment House uses it to attract new executives...
Youre talking to their new Vice President of Mergers and Acquisitions.
What are you talking about, Jack?
Are you out of your mind?
I dont think so. This is going to be a better life for all of us, honey. Well put Annie and Josh in private schools...
I dont think so. This is going to be a better life for all of us, honey. Well put Annie and Josh in private schools...
Annie goes to a great school.
Annie goes to a great school.
Im talking about the best schools in the country here, Kate...

Jack, what could you possibly be thinking? What about my job?
Jack, what could you possibly be thinking? What about my job?
This is New York City, its like the needy people capital of the world. Those Jersey clients of yours arent a tenth as pathetic as the ones you could get here...
This is New York City, its like the needy people capital of the world. Those Jersey clients of yours arent a tenth as pathetic as the ones you could get here...
I cant believe you want to move back into the city. I thought the reason we left was because we didnt want to raise the kids here?
I cant believe you want to move back into the city. I thought the reason we left was because we didnt want to raise the kids here?
No, this is the center of the universe. If I were living in Roman times, I would live in Rome, where else? Today, America is the Roman Empire and New York is Rome itself. John Lennon.
No, this is the center of the universe. If I were living in Roman times, I would live in Rome, where else? Today, America is the Roman Empire and New York is Rome itself. John Lennon.
Jack.
I can do that. I want to do that. For all of us. I need to do that as a man... Think about it. No more lousy restaurants, no more clipping coupons, no more shoveling snow...
Then get a goddamn snow blower!
Dont do that...
Look, youre making this into something its not. This isnt a referendum on our lives, Kate. Its a step forward... Dont you see? Im talking about us finally having a life other people envy.
Its been interesting, thats for sure.
But Ive done some good things too, havent I?
But Ive done some good things too, havent I?
Youve been Jack Campbell. And thats always a good thing...
I need you to remember me, Kate. How I am right now, right this very moment. I need you to put that image in your heart and keep it with you, no matter what happens.
Are you okay, Jack?
Are you okay, Jack?
Please, just promise me youll do that. You have to promise, Kate. Because if you dont, then its like it never happened and I dont think I could live with that.
I promise, Jack...
Promise me again...
Promise me again...
I promise. Come to bed, honey.
Kate...
Jack...God, its been so long...You look...
You look great.
Its good to see you...
I'm sorry...
Dont worry about it, Jack...
Whats going on?
Im moving to Paris...it was right here... Its a box marked Jack. I put it in the stack for the Salvation Army...
Im moving to Paris...it was right here... Its a box marked Jack. I put it in the stack for the Salvation Army...
Paris?
Youre moving...
Uh huh. To Paris. My firm has an office there and Im going to be heading it up.
Uh huh. To Paris. My firm has an office there and Im going to be heading it up.
To Paris. Paris, France.

Thats the one...

So youre not at a non- profit firm?

Not with what they pay me...

Youre not married, are you?
Youre not married, are you?
No, Jack, I never got married. You?
No, Jack, I never got married. You?
Not exactly... Can we just take a minute here? Maybe get a cup of coffee or something...?
You cant go!
Jesus, Jack...
Jesus, Jack...
Dont get on that plane!
Dont get on that plane!
Jack.
Jack.
Please. Lets just go have a cup of coffee. Thats all Im asking for. Im sure theres another flight to Paris tonight.
Please. Lets just go have a cup of coffee. Thats all Im asking for. Im sure theres another flight to Paris tonight.
What do you want from me? You want me to tell you everything that happened was okay?
Dont do this, Jack... But he continues...
We have two kids, Annie and Josh...
Mrs. Peterson.
Hello Jack. You dont have to stop singing on my account...
Hello Jack. You dont have to stop singing on my account...
Its because Im shy, Betty. So, when are you going to leave that old corpse Mr. Peterson and run away with me?
Its because Im shy, Betty. So, when are you going to leave that old corpse Mr. Peterson and run away with me?
You know you could never satisfy me the way he does...
No...
Thank you, Betty. I know if I can just sleep this off, Ill be fine...
Thank you, Betty. I know if I can just sleep this off, Ill be fine...
And sleep you shall. Noblesse oblige is not dead. Not yet anyway...Come, lets get you some help. Surely there must be a shelter somewhere in this city.
And sleep you shall. Noblesse oblige is not dead. Not yet anyway...Come, lets get you some help. Surely there must be a shelter somewhere in this city.
A shelter?! Im the richest guy in the building...Ive got twice the square footage you have!
Peter. I don't see you rushing home to trim the tree.
That's because I'm a heartless bastard who only cares about money.
That's because I'm a heartless bastard who only cares about money.
And God love you for it.
I just got a call from Terry Haight. Bob Thomas is nervous...

I need you, tiger..

Where is he?

Aspen.
Hey Peter, lemme ask you a question. An old girlfriend calls you out of the blue on Christmas Eve...
You suddenly having trouble getting dates?
You suddenly having trouble getting dates?
Not by a long shot.
Not by a long shot.
Then leave it in the past. Old flames are like old tax returns. You keep `em in the file cabinet for three years and then you cut `em loose.
Peter Lassiter...
Do I know you?
Do I know you?
Not exactly. Ive seen you on CNBC. You look taller in real life...
...were really more of a boutique operation, as you can see...
But youre not interested in boutique dollars... I get it...
He certainly has your number, Alan.
Youre a little tougher, Peter.
For one thing, you like expensive things.
Thats easy. Youve seen my car.
Thats easy. Youve seen my car.
Okay...you smoke Hoyo de Monterreys. Youre a scotch man, single malt, not because its trendy but because youve been doing it for forty years, and you stay with what works. You have two great loves in your life, your horses and this company. You wept openly the day the Dow hit ten thousand...
For the money, theyre hands down the best radial we carry...
Okay, Ill take them...
Okay, Ill take them...
You wont regret it... Tommy! Set Mr. Conlin up with four B.F. Goodrich G-Force T/As... ...and give him ten percent off for having the best costume...
Can I help you?
Is Kate here? Does Kate live here?!
Is Kate here? Does Kate live here?!
Kate? No, theres no one here named Kate. Is that good enough for you?
Damn...damn...damn...
Hey, are you okay?
Hey, are you okay?
No...Im not...
No...Im not...
Is there anything I can do for you?
Hey, my wifes in the kitchen. You got a cigarette?
Im sorry, no...
Did you really mean what you said about Tuscany?
Of course I did.
Of course I did.
Last night was great...
Last night was great...
You are an amazing lover. You should be giving motivational seminars.

Thanks. You're not bad yourself...
I want to see you again.
I'd like that, too.
I'd like that, too.
Tonight.
It's Christmas Eve, Jack.
So we'll get egg nog.
I have to go to my parents' house out in Jersey. Would you like to come?
Jersey? You know what the traffic's gonna be like?
Jersey? You know what the traffic's gonna be like?
I'm taking the train...
Don't you have anywhere to go?
I've got plenty of places to go.
Maybe I can try and sneak away some time tomorrow morning... Okay?
If it's something you feel strongly about.
Thats totally see through...
Merry Christmas...
Merry Christmas...
Christmas? It cant be Christmas...
Do you want me to look for the box or call the airline?
Hey, kind of under a little pressure here.
Hey, kind of under a little pressure here.
Hey, kind of giving up Christmas day for my ex-boss here.
You didnt seem to mind offering to help me on Christmas day when you were unwrapping that Prada bag I gave you.
Maybe its by the wardrobe boxes...
Ill go for a cup of coffee!
Yes!
I found it!
Congratulations. The La Guardia flights canceled but I got you out of Kennedy on United at nine. Am I good or what?
You know, you could'a run an ad in the personals.
"Sensual blind chick seeks three-ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."
"Sensual blind chick seeks three-ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."
This ain't permanent. My friend Reed's working on a cure...I think.
You don't know what it's like out there. Walking around like some kind of circus freak. People staring, whispering --
I wouldn't know anything about that.
I wouldn't know anything about that.
I mean...
I mean...
Tell me. When you grew up in Brooklyn, how many astronauts did you know? You went your own way then. You didn't listen to people. So why start now...?
I don't think She's real big on hate.
You wouldn't say that, if you could see me.
Such a sad face... You know, sometimes being different isn't a bad thing.
Trust me, this ain't one of those times.
How'd you know it was me?
I'm blind, not deaf. Wanna come in?
I'm not really dressed for a party.
Relax, it's casual.
Relax, it's casual.
No, I mean...I'm a little...dusty...
Those yours too?
My step-dad's. I'm strictly into stone. I was wondering when you'd walk by.
We're going to have to work on your touch.
I like the sound of that.
Good thing it ain't workin... Reed, what are we doing here? This guy's fast-food, strip-mall science --
This wasn't our first stop, in case you forgot NASA. And Victor's not that bad. He's just a little... Larger than life.
He's financed some of the biggest breakthroughs of this century.
You'd never know it.
I can't take this.
Ben. This is business. Just work.
What about his first born?
Ben, the money's not important. We could <u>save lives</u>.
He <u>knew</u> about NASA. What if he made the call to shut us down --
Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works --

We got what we wanted. That's <u>enough</u>.
I know, I know. I'm just worried about what <u>he</u> wants... Speaking of which...
Can't do it. I cannot do it.
External SRBs, orbital system engines. Its just like the shuttles you flew in --

No. I cannot take orders from that underwear model. That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight simulator.
No. I cannot take orders from that underwear model. That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight simulator.
Youthful high spirits.
They crashed it into a wall. A flight <i>simulator</i>.
I'm sure he's matured since then.
When have I asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do?
Five times.
Five times.
I had it at four.
I had it at four.
This makes five.
Isn't that <u>your</u> speech?
He's made a few changes.
He's made a few changes.
This is your dream, Reed. You should be the one up there.
This is your dream, Reed. You should be the one up there.
Victor's better at these things.
The shields on the station should protect us.
<u>Should</u>?
I ain't done arranging your flowers, egghead.
Ben. This is serious. <u>Turn around</u>.
How long was I out?
Three days. I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
Three days. I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
Solid.
I don't know. I just keep going over and over the numbers.
Reed. Even <u>you</u> can't compute every little thing.
Reed. Even <u>you</u> can't compute every little thing.
I should have done more, run more tests --
You go through something like this, makes you appreciate having the right woman in your life.
Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --
Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --
Reed, I'm not talking about Debbie.
What? Come on. She's got a good thing with Victor --
I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?

He's smart, powerful, successful --
He's smart, powerful, successful --
Well maybe <u>you</u> should date him.
Are you alright?
I think I need to lie down. Bad shrimp.
What the --!
Ben. Are you okay?
Ben. Are you okay?
Am <u>I</u> okay?! You wanna explain that?!
We had a tough year.
Yeah, nine years straight.
You got a chisel round here?
If we're going to identify the source of the mutation, we need to isolate your recombinant DNA so we can activate positional genomes.
Okay. I've uh, got some questions, from Sue. That she thought might be better coming from me... Can you, you know, go to the bathroom...like normal...
Yeah. You don't wanna know the details.
Yeah. You don't wanna know the details.
Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
O-kay. We'll skip that question.
It's about to be a broken face.
This isn't permanent, Johnny. We need to be careful until we're normal again.
Ben --
Oh, you remember my name do you? You happen to remember what you <u>swore</u> to do with every breath in your body?
Oh, you remember my name do you? You happen to remember what you <u>swore</u> to do with every breath in your body?
We're working as hard as we can --
We're working as hard as we can --
Yeah. I can tell. Victor was right.
Glad "nothing" could take you away from your work.
Ben, I don't know if this thing'll change us back or make us worse. I need you to be patient for a little while longe--
Time for <u>your</u> lesson, Vic. Chem 101: what happens when you <u>supercool</u> hot metal...? Ben...
Got it, teach.
Ben, I've been crunching the numbers on the machine. I think if we can rework the power settings...
Forget it, egghead. I'm good as is.
What the hell you smiling at? Just keep your mouth shut, and your mind on those SMBs --
Actually, the engines are SMEs. Hydrogenbase, carbon propellant. Couple generations past your last ride. I'm not as dumb as you look.
If you behave, maybe next time daddy'll let you drive.
Keep talking, there won't <u>be</u> a next time.
Please tell me your dawg's not trying to rekindle things with my sister.
'Course not. Strictly business.
'Course not. Strictly business.
Yeah, well, his eyes say different.

Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.
Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.
Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God? Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp. Hmmm, it's a toss-up.

Don't you wander off, boy.
Where...where am I?
Back on Earth. Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.
Back on Earth. Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.
Reed? ... Sue?
Reed? ... Sue?
They're fine. Everybody <i>else</i>...is fine.
What's wrong with me?
I swear to you they've done everything humanly possible. The best plastic surgeons in the world, Ben. You had the best --
I swear to you they've done everything humanly possible. The best plastic surgeons in the world, Ben. You had the best --
Give me a mirror...
They said that's not such a good idea, the shock alone could --
Give me the god damn mirror!
Hey! That's a <u>prototype</u>!
Go back to the drawing board.
The machine works. And Vic's gone Mister Hyde on us --
Really? With a name like Von <u>Doom</u>? Never saw <u>that</u> one coming.
No more cracks about how I look.
Hey, I'm Mr. Sensitivity now. Clear the way, wide load coming through.
I'll be watching over you.
Just get back soon, or I start looking for a new groom.
Soon as I'm back, I'm gonna trade that in for a bigger rock.
I don't care about rocks, I care about <u>you</u>. You bring him back in one piece, or you can forget being Best Man.
Deb... It's me. I need you to step out front.
Out front? You home, baby? I got a surprise for you.
Ben?
Don't come any closer for a sec. This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said "together forever no matter what"?
Don't come any closer for a sec. This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said "together forever no matter what"?
Baby, you're scaring me.
Oh my G-g-g. What did you...do to Ben?
Deb, it's me. It's still me.
What did you wish for, honey?
I already got it. Everything I want.
What are <u>you</u> doing here?
I'm worried about you.
I'm worried about you.
About me? How sweet.
About me? How sweet.
Come on. Let me buy you something to eat. Looks like you could use the company.
Ben, come in.
What is this? Where's Reed?
What is this? Where's Reed?
Where do you <u>think</u>? With <u>Sue</u>.
What do you want, Vic?
To help you. I've run every test known to man. And they all yield the same result: <u>the machine is ready</u>.
Reed said it'd be weeks till --
He <u>also</u> said we'd avoid that storm in space. And we know how that turned out.
He couldn't generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass. Yet another mistake for "Mr. Fantastic."
And you can? Power it up?
Way to not overthink it. So when do we leave?
I'll schedule the launch. Call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew.
I can handle the ship. I can even handle Mr. Blonde Ambition. But I don't know if I should be flying or playing Vegas in these suits. Who the hell came up with them?
Victor did.
We can monitor the cloud's approach and observe the tests from here.
Is it safe?
I can only stay for one drink, Ben. I've got to meet with Victor.
Wouldn't want to keep Vic waiting.
We need to give you a physical, so we know what got zapped.
Well why didn't you say so? You want me to lift some weights or something?
You look like an eighties rock band.
The suit will stretch. You should try it --
The suit will stretch. You should try it --
I wouldn't be caught dead in that.
He didn't.
Oh, he did.
Oh, he did.
<u>What</u> did he do to the uniform?!
He didn't mean it. You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead --
It's not him. It's <u>them</u>. I can't live like this.
It's not him. It's <u>them</u>. I can't live like this.
Just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one --
Just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one --
It's easy for you to be patient.
It's easy for you to be patient.
No, it's not. I thought I was done waiting for Reed... We're all in this together now, Ben.
<u>Where is Reed</u>?
Victor must've taken him.
Your tissue, your organs, your entire biophysical structure is changing. Every system is still functioning, somehow --
And they're changing into...
And they're changing into...
I don't really know. A compound organic-metallic alloy. Stronger than titanium or carbon steel. Harder than diamonds --
I don't really know. A compound organic-metallic alloy. Stronger than titanium or carbon steel. Harder than diamonds --
Like the shields Reed said would protect us. How long?

At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
What do you mean "complete"?
What do you mean "complete"?
I wish I could tell you. I can't pretend to know what we're dealing with here. I'll notify the CDC and --
What?
The Center for Disease Control. If this thing is contagious --
But...this disease...is progressive... degenerative...
That's terrible news...
Victor's right. Johnny, get to the command center. Close the shields.
What about you?
He's not responsive --
Ben! Ben!
Now what is up with <i>that</i>?
The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.
The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.
Cool. What'd it do to you guys?
Oh, you dawg you. Better not be my nurse!
Ben, are you there?
This is wrong in so many ways.
You've been working out.
Ben Grimm is a genuine American hero who's been through a terrible orde--
What he's trying to say is: every team needs a mascot...
Twenty? From outside the place looks a lot taller.
Oh, it is.
We should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes...
This place is deluxe. You got cable?
This place is deluxe. You got cable?
...and figure out how to reverse them. Let me show you to your rooms.
Back it down, Johnny!
I can go hotter!
Not only could you kill yourself, but you could set fire to Earth's atmosphere and destroy all human life as we know it.
Gotcha. Okay. Supernova bad.
Is there something about flames? About flaming, that you --
What are you trying to say? Just because I dress well and like to dance --
What are you trying to say? Just because I dress well and like to dance --
What? No. I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
What? No. I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
Oh, well that's easy: I'm hot. You're...well, you're a little limp. Sue's easy to see through. And Ben's always been a hardass. Why aren't you writing this down?
He's right. These costumes are... missing something. I can't put my finger on it --
They're not costumes.
That's what I'm trying to calculate. And it's not rubber. It's muscle, tendon. I seem to have the ability to manipulate the malleability of my molecular structure and redistribute my density to --
Right, whatever, have fun.
You need to control yourself and <u>think</u> before you --
Act. Here we go again. Reed, what if we got these gifts for a <u>reason</u>? What if we have some, you know...like, calling?
Act. Here we go again. Reed, what if we got these gifts for a <u>reason</u>? What if we have some, you know...like, calling?
A higher calling like getting girls and making money?
Johnny. SUPERNOVA.
But all these people...
But all these people...
<u>Now</u>.
And where do we think we're going?
I don't know if "we've" noticed, but the sickest runs this side of the Alps are <i>right outside that window</i> --
You're hot!
So are you!
So are you!
I mean, you feel a little feverish.
I mean, you feel a little feverish.
I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
Meet me at 4:01, top of the run. That'll give you a minute to freshen up.
Me like-y.
Stay right. Left is trouble.
Stay right. Left is trouble.
I though we went over this.
I though we went over this.
Last one down springs for room service.
You're on fire!
Not this again --
Not this again --
No: You're <u>ON FIRE</u>!
The synthetics act as a second skin, adapting to your individual needs to --
Keep the hot side hot, and the cool side cool!
Apparently I can disappear.
<u>Please</u> tell me you go silent too.
Flame on, flame off. Flame on, flame off --
Johnny.
Stop it.
Okay, "mom."
What is that <i>thing</i>?
I think that thing is Ben.
Wait. You mean there's chance we could be full-on-24-7-fantastic?
Grow up, Johnny. You want to run around <u>on fire</u> for the rest of your life?
Grow up, Johnny. You want to run around <u>on fire</u> for the rest of your life?
Is that a trick question? C'mon, I can't be the only one who thinks this is cool.
You're really cramping my style here.
You were at 4000 Kelvin. Any hotter, you're approaching supernova --
You were at 4000 Kelvin. Any hotter, you're approaching supernova --
Sweet.
Sweet.
That's the temperature of the <u>sun</u>.
Uh, we call my sister the invisible girl...the Invisible Girl.
<u>Girl</u>...?!
I'm driving.
Dude. That's my sister.
You're gonna pay for that, Pebbles. What?!
You gave us <u>names</u>? What are you, the "face" of the Fantastic Four now?
You two need a time-out.
Blockhead started it!
Johnny? Did you see Ben?
Yeah, for the last time, I hope. I'm done with this freak show. I'm moving back to the real world.
Yeah, for the last time, I hope. I'm done with this freak show. I'm moving back to the real world.
Is that what you call it? "<i>Real</i>"?
Is that what you call it? "<i>Real</i>"?
At least it beats living in a lab like somebody's science project.
Johnny, slow down. <u>Think</u>. You know mom didn't raise us to --
Look around, sis! <u>She's not here</u>. So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy --
Look around, sis! <u>She's not here</u>. So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy --
As soon as you stop <u>acting</u> like one. Come on, you're <u>smarter</u> than this. You think those people out there <u>care</u> about you? You're just a <u>fad</u> to them.
I'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --
No, <u>I'm</u> sorry, for pushing you out.
What are you doing --
Sis. Let <u>me</u> take care of <u>you</u> for once.
Sis. Let <u>me</u> take care of <u>you</u> for once.
But Johnny...you <u>can't fly</u>.
If Reed's right, then this little trip will double our stock offering.
And if he's not...?
And if he's not...?
Reed's <u>always</u> right. Good thing he doesn't always know what he's got...
They're ready for you, sir.
Showtime.
Our numbers are through the roof. The IPO's tracking at fifty, sixty a share. The bank's five times oversubscribed --
It's not just the money. I could make money in my sleep.
It's not just the money. I could make money in my sleep.
Then what is it?
Then what is it?
History, Leonard. <u>History</u>. Everything else is conversation... How's the other matter?
Leonard, how's the feed?
Recording, sir. We see you perfectly.
How's the IPO?
Stable. We're looking at low twenties. It's a good number, considering the fallout from --
Stable. We're looking at low twenties. It's a good number, considering the fallout from --
Reed's disaster. You know, I half- think he did this to me on purpose.
Reed's disaster. You know, I half- think he did this to me on purpose.
Sir, I'm sure he wouldn't put himself --
Get me on the AM shows, Larry King, cover of the Journal... I've <u>got to</u> do something about this scar. Make sure they only shoot my right side.
Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar "humanizes" you.
Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar "humanizes" you.
And that's a <u>good</u> thing?
You know, maybe you should get some rest --
Later. First, I've got some unfinished business. A deal that needs closing...
Sir, I've always wondered... Why <u>Sue</u>? You could have any woman in the world but --
<u>That's</u> why. Because I could have any <u>other</u> woman... You know, when they asked Caesar "why England," he said, "because it's not <u>mine</u>."
Make sure you find Ben, bring him back here. And keep it quiet. I don't need this to hit the press.
Yes sir. You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
Yes sir. You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
Front page?
Front page?
Top left, like you asked. Today Wall Street. Tomorrow, who knows...maybe Washington.
But dreams don't pay the bills, do they? Same old Reed, the hopeless optimist. Still reaching for the stars, with the world on your back.
You remember in school we talked about working together. That's what I was about to explain...
This isn't going to be a problem, is it?
Not at all.
You back this mission, and I'll sign over a fair percentage of any applications or --
The number's <u>seventy-five</u>. And it's applications <u>and</u> patents.
Funny how things turn out, isn't it?
Hilarious.
Got it. So take a walk, Ben...I'm going to borrow Susan for a second.
Sure.
We've got <u>minutes</u> until it hits, not hours...Victor, that storm's <u>deadly</u> -- the radiation's lethal. We need to abort.
Get a grip. Reed. We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch. Just close the shields...
Get a grip. Reed. We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch. Just close the shields...
Ben's still out there --
Ben's still out there --
So reel him in. But we came here to do a <u>job</u>. So let's do it. <u>Quickly</u>.
Come on, Ben, come on...
Reed, we're running out of time.
Not until Ben is back inside!
It's too late for him, and soon it'll be too late for all of us.
Just a little banged up. A couple scrapes. Why?
Ben did this.
Ben did this.
<u>Ben</u> did this?
<u>Ben</u> did this?
He's had some kind of...reaction to exposure from the cloud. And he's not the only one.
I'm starting to wonder the same thing... How much do you know about what happened to you?
Not much. We need to run tests to see the extent of the damage.
Didn't go as <u>planned</u>? It was a <u>catastrophe</u>. You ruined the lives of four people --
<u>I</u> ruined? With all due respect, I told you to abort --
<u>I</u> ruined? With all due respect, I told you to abort --
<u>Abort</u>? Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will <u>not</u> let you make me look like a fool --
<u>Abort</u>? Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will <u>not</u> let you make me look like a fool --
Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --
Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --
I don't want to <u>understand</u> it. This isn't one of your science projects. I just want to <u>fix</u> it. <u>Fast</u>!
What are you doing here?
What I <u>should</u> have done a long time ago. Applications and patents, Reed. This all belongs to me.
But I'm not done with the machine --
Which is precisely the <u>point</u>. Analysis is over. It's time for <u>action</u>. My men could have mass- produced this by now.
You're, you've, I mean, how have you bee--
Never better.
Those solar winds are flaring, but I factored them into my coordinates and --
I was talking about us. Working together.
Well, uh, based on our history...you can handle the biogenetics, and I'll focus on the molecular physics. Or, uhm, maybe I should take the biotech, you work the microscopes, since you have some background in electropho--
Right. That's exactly what I meant.
I, uh, think I remember the number.
It's been changed.
As far as crew, I was hoping Ben could pilot the mission --
Well, he's welcome to ride shotgun, but we already have a pilot on our payroll. You remember my brother Johnny...
Material made from self-regulating unstable molecules. I've been working on a formula for this.
Great minds think alike.
Feeling better?
Yes, thanks.
Yes, thanks.
That's good. That's uh...good.
That's good. That's uh...good.
You always had a way with words. I should be getting back.
You're <u>happy</u> for me and Victor.
I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship --
I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship --
Which was?
Which was?
Passion.
For science.
You are such a dork, Reed... You never got it and never will unless it's explained to you in quantum physics.
Uh, Sue...? I <u>can't</u>.
What? What do you mean you --
What? What do you mean you --
Sue...<i>look at your hands</i>.
It has to be the cloud. It's fundamentally altered our DNA.
Let's not jump to conclusions, we need a <i>massive amount of evidence</i> before making that leap.
What?
We need to get past them.
Sue. Your clothes. Lose them.
What...? <u>Oh</u>.
How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us?
That's what we're here to find out.
That's what we're here to find out.
If it happened to him, then it could...
It's not "invisibility" per se. You're bending the light around you with some kind of malleable force field. That's what you projected on the Bridge.
What about you? You haven't eaten in days. How come you're never on this side of the microscope?
You should be able to bend light around other objects, even people, if you could control your emotional state better --
Excuse me?
I'm saying, if you had a little more self control, you could locate the trigger. Can you remember the exact emotions when --
Anger. Rage. Frustration.
Anger. Rage. Frustration.
Okay. Is there any way to duplicate that feeling? Some memory or...
Okay. Is there any way to duplicate that feeling? Some memory or...
I'm sure I can come up with something.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that... You must think that was some kind of latent hostility or --
What in the world would give me that idea?
I mean, <u>you</u> broke up with <u>me</u>, right?
Are you kidding?
Are you kidding?
No, I distinctly remember: <u>you</u> walked out <u>my</u> door. Ergo...
Reed. I was ready for the next step, you weren't, ergo, I walked.
I think it was a little more complicated than --
I think it was a little more complicated than --
I just wanted to share an apartment. What was so complicated about that?
There were a lot of variables to consider --
No. There weren't. There was <u>you</u>. And <u>me</u>. No variables, no math. It was actually the simplest thing in the world. But your head got in the way... like it always does.
What are you doing?
The plants, from space. Their particles are still charged. With the right amount of energy, those ions could <u>create</u> the elemental profile of the cosmic storm.
If we can build a machine to re-create the storm, we can reverse the polarity --
And reverse the mutations --
And reverse the mutations --
Curing countless diseases, not just ours.
But <u>we're</u> the focus, right Reed? <u>Reed</u>...?
Of course. Of course.
Of course. Of course.
And you sure you can control this thing? Last time didn't work out so well.
And you sure you can control this thing? Last time didn't work out so well.
With the right energy, we can stabilize the storm. Maybe tie into the city grid...
Reed. How close are we to a cure?
No way to know. Without more tests, experiments.
Don't let Victor push you into making a mistake --
He was going to take away all my data, equipment --
He was going to take away all my data, equipment --
Better than your <u>life</u>. Victor's not the one who has to get into that thing. <u>We</u> are.
Which is why I'm working <u>twenty</u> hours a day, checking every variable --
Every variable but <u>yourself</u>. You don't eat, sleep. You can't live in your head like --
Every variable but <u>yourself</u>. You don't eat, sleep. You can't live in your head like --
<u>I'm</u> not the only one in there. I got you, Vic, Ben, Johnny, all rattling around in there.
I could get Ben to tap into the Baxter's main power to generate enough voltage --
Reed. Shh. Just be quiet. And look up.
Remember our first date here...? God, I was so nervous.
You <u>were</u>?
You <u>were</u>?
Of course I was. I'd read all your papers on bioethics. Some of them two times just so I'd have something to say to you.
You know, I bribed the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late?
I gave him twenty.
You always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach you...speak his mind. One who wasn't afraid to tell you what he wanted.
I did. I did, Reed...but I wanted <u>you</u> to be that man.
When I walked out, I waited <u>ten</u> <u>minutes</u> outside your door. Ten. Waiting for you to come find me.
Why didn't you say something?
Why didn't you say something?
That would have kinda defeated the purpose. And Reed... I'm saying it now.
I can...make it work.
Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
The power...I need...more power...to control...the storm --
The power...I need...more power...to control...the storm --
You <u>need</u> a doctor.
Sue, I need some of that anger, rage, frustration --
I'm sure I can come up with something.
I found a broken gasket, from space --
A <u>gasket</u>? Reed, we're at a party.
It's just business.
I think you both know my Director of Genetic Research, Susan Storm.
Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?
I understand the <i>business</i> reasons.
I understand the <i>business</i> reasons.
Well, when you're looking at your future, it never hurts to find closure about the past.
It's been a good two years, Victor... The company's accomplished so much.
Right, of course, the company... But you see, I've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with --
Right, of course, the company... But you see, I've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with --
Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...
Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...
Sue, I've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps. And this is the biggest step yet. If it helps, think of this as a <u>promotion</u>. A merger of sorts... Four little words that can change our lives...
What are you doing?
Raising the shields.
Raising the shields.
You can't leave them out there.
What's going on?
Victor, are you feeling alright?
Victor, I'm sorry I --
Just <u>find</u> him.
Victor, your scar --
I told you, I'm fine. It's <u>you</u> I'm worried about.
I told you, I'm fine. It's <u>you</u> I'm worried about.
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
Please, no apologies. I've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos. You'll have round-the clock care.
You said it was urgent.
It is. There's something we need to talk about. Something I need to ask you...
Victor, wait, slow down a second. I want you to know I appreciate everything you've done for me, but I just don't --
Susan. What are you doing?
He's working round the clock. But the data needs to be tested, analyzed before --
Same old Reed. All analysis, no action. Wasn't that the problem with you two?
If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us <u>worse</u>, maybe even kill us.
Then why is Reed dragging his feet? Maybe he <u>likes</u> having his prize specimen under glass... It's ironic, isn't it? You're finally the perfect woman for him...because you're his <u>science project</u>.
Please don't make this personal --
Oh, I think you already have.
Oh, I think you already have.
Victor, we <u>can't do anything</u> until the research is ready.
'Scuse me.
I know it can't be easy. Life hasn't changed that much for Reed, Sue and Johnny. At least they can go out in public. But for you? People staring. Whispering behind your back...
I know it can't be easy. Life hasn't changed that much for Reed, Sue and Johnny. At least they can go out in public. But for you? People staring. Whispering behind your back...
If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job --
If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job --
I'm just saying, I know what it's like to lose something you love. To see it slip away, and know it's never coming back.
Reed's gonna fix me up --
For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
Skeptical...?
Grant's uniquely qualified for this mission. He's a Communications Expert and was a Frogman during the War. Besides, he brought Benes into this country, and the fewer people who know about him, the better. At any rate, you'll find Grant invaluable, should anything go wrong once you're under way. Okay, Don.
Here's the overall Target Area...
Benes' natural defenses. White Corpuscles -- Antibodies. Once you begin to grow -- and become a menace to the body -- you'll trigger them off... MICHAELS With all the unknown factors in the body, I still say risking five lives for one is something we should reconsider --
We understand your concern, but we've made our decision, Doctor. Any questions? Anybody?
Where do we stand?
Medical's ready.
Okay to proceed.
Phase Two.
They've crossed over into the Jugular Vein!
That can't be -- there's no direct connection between the two --
That can't be -- there's no direct connection between the two --
Normally not. Unless it's an Arterio-Venous Fistula --
But we have no choice! We've got, to take them out!
No...
We still have fifty-one minutes. Leave them in.
But it's hopeless! They can't go back and they can't go on. I tell you there's nothing else we can do but remove them!
But it's hopeless! They can't go back and they can't go on. I tell you there's nothing else we can do but remove them!
Not until the very last second. We must think of something... Something to save the situation.
Doctor...without killing him -- how long could we stop his heart?
The less time, the better.
The less time, the better.
I know that. But what's the maximum?
I know that. But what's the maximum?
In his comatose state...and everything slowed down...no more than sixty seconds.
At topspeed...and adjusting distance for Degree of Miniaturization -- The sub should get through the Heart in fifty-seven seconds.
That would give us only three seconds to revive him...

Nothing -- compared to starting it up again.

Message to Proteus.
They're in the Pulmonary Artery.
They'll make up some time, once they get through that and reach the Pleural Cavity. Respiration Post...
Another delay... With only forty-two minutes left.
It'll be close -- but there's still a margin of safety.
It'll be close -- but there's still a margin of safety.
Let's find what the devil's holding them up! Contact the Proteus!
I told you to cut down on the sugar.
I can't help it. I'm just weak, I guess.
Time's up... We'll have to take them out immediately.
It means killing Benes... And for all we know, they may have completed the operation! Damn it to hell!
What is it?
That blip we're picking up might only be the radio-active particle. The Proteus may already be destroyed...

Along the Optic Nerve to the Eye.
Now how soon can we try Sodium Pentathol?
I'd hold that off awhile.
I'd hold that off awhile.
Well, how about hypnosis? That can't hurt him!
Hello, Grant. Good to see you again.
The Pentagon, wasn't it, General? Only you weren't in that uniform...
Benes... What the devil happened?
The Other Side got to him.
The Other Side got to him.
How bad off is he?
How bad off is he?
Brain injury.
Brain injury.
Before or after what he wanted to tell you?
Before or after what he wanted to tell you?
Before he could breathe a word. He's the only scientist who knows the answer to what we're after. That's why we have to operate --
-- and why we need you.
<Me>?
I can't even put a Band-Aid on my finger.
Here's the Surgeon.
Duval. Dr. Peter Duval. Top brain man in the country. Ever hear of him?
Sorry, but I'm rusty on surgeons. Who's the girl?
Sorry, but I'm rusty on surgeons. Who's the girl?
Cora Peterson, his Technical Assistant. You'll join Duval and the others --
Cora Peterson, his Technical Assistant. You'll join Duval and the others --
What can I do? Except maybe pass out?
Wish I knew why.
Tell him where he fits in, will you? I've got a few things to check out.
But why take the chance, when there must be other doctors?
We have no choice. Duval's the most skillful brain surgeon in the country, and he's right here, at hand.
We have no choice. Duval's the most skillful brain surgeon in the country, and he's right here, at hand.
I wouldn't know if he's trying to save him or kill him.
Right, sir.
Come along, they'll be operating shortly. See you later, Mike.
His technician okay? In addition to the Looks Department?
No question of her loyalty.
I don't mean to be inquisitive. But this <CMDF> -- for all I know it could stand for <Consolidated Mobilization of Female Delinquents>?
<Combined Miniature Deterrent Forces>.
<Combined Miniature Deterrent Forces>.
Say that again?
General, I've heard some wild ones. But this takes it.
We can shrink an Army -- with all its equipment -- and put it in a bottle cap. That's why we call it <Combined Miniature Deterrent Forces>.

If the Other Side ever gets hold of a thing like that...
If the Other Side ever gets hold of a thing like that...
They have... But we've both got the same problem -- lack or control. We can only keep things Miniaturized for exactly sixty minutes. Arter that, everything starts growing back to its original size.
I assume Benes knows how to control it.
That's right. He wanted us to have the secret, and not them. Which is why they tried to kill him.
That's right. He wanted us to have the secret, and not them. Which is why they tried to kill him.
They're bound to try again. No wonder they want me to stand by during the operation.

Well, the only way to reach that clot is from inside the Brain. So we've decided to put a Surgical Team and a Crew into a submarine -- reduce it way down in size, and inject it into an Artery --

It's only for an hour --
It's only for an hour --
Not even for a minute! General Carter, sir, I'd like you to reconsider your choice. I'm just not the right man for a mission of this kind.
This is Dr. Duval, our Head Surgeon.
Oh yes, I've heard of you, Doctor.
There'll be a team of Surgeons standing by. We're prepared to remove you immediately, should anything go wrong. In any event, you must be out within sixty minutes. After that, you'll be in danger of attack.
Attack? Who -- or should I say what from?
Just one, General...
Yes?
Yes?
Where can I get a cab back to town?
Oh yes, great. The only problem is, he can't remember what he came to tell us.
Can't remember?... What do you mean?
Can't remember?... What do you mean?
He's blanked out on that one particular point.
Yes, we'd like to get moving.
Why don't you go on. We'll meet you at the Clearance Desk in a few minutes.
Yes, Alan.
Meet Grant. This is Dr. Michaels, Chief of the Medical Section.

Glad to have you with us, Mr. Grant.

I don't agree. Just because he's often difficult --
I don't agree. Just because he's often difficult --
Difficult? He's impossible!
Difficult? He's impossible!
That's no reason to suspect him of disloyalty.
I'll be standing by. <I'll> know.
And no matter what happens, you're to take orders <only> from Dr. Michaels, understand?
Listen...the Heart.
Yes...slowed down agreat deal.
I can't imagine how it possibly could have come loose. I distinctly recall fastening it with all four bolts --
It must have been jarred loose during the whirlpool.
But we just can't leave him in there! What'll happen to him?
We'll know -- in the next breath...
That's beside the point now. I don't see the sense of going on.
We must!
We must!
With no laser --
You're going out there? With those Antibodies --
No danger of attack, as long as you don't trigger them off by any injury to the System.
Wouldn't it be quicker if we all helped?
Yes, there's no time to spare. And those fibers can be quite tenacious.
Doctor...
Yes, Cora.
Yes, Cora.
I -- I want to say...
What is it? Anything wrong?
I just wanted to thank you for taking me along.
I just wanted to thank you for taking me along.
Thank you for volunteering.
Never saw <that>. Not even under an electron-mrcroscope.
They're much smaller than bacteria...
Yes, a fistula too small to show up on the X-rays.
But big enough for us...
Doctor...you can't mean that! Not when we've come this far. And if we give up, there'll be no way of saving Mr. Benes --
Dr. Michaels is right. We have no choice.
Air bubbles!... Doctor --
No danger of an embolism. At our reduced scale, they're much too minute to prove fatal to Benes.
Cora, is something wrong with the laser?
I don't know yet, Doctor. And I won't know until I test it.
He's making a fine recovery.
He certainly is. He should be up and about in no time.
Bet you're pretty handy around the house... Can you cook?
We're pushing oxygen today.

I'll take some Laughing Gas, ma'am.

You may learn to like it.
That'll teach you where to keep your hand.
Now I know...
That could be quite a lethal weapon... It could kill, not cure.
Not in the hands of a great surgeon like Dr. Duval. The beam of this laser can be regulated to one millionth of a millimeter.

Not working for someone like Dr. Duval --
I never...never imagined it could be anything...like this.
I always thought it was nothing but red.
-- at which point the Heart will be stopped by electric shock.
And if it should take more time to get through --
Look at that...they're changing color...
Doctor -- is it possible? That we're seeing it happen before our eyes?
Looks like you didn't batten it down too well.
But I did. I'm positive!
Then how come it worked loose?
I have no idea.
Shouldn't you answer that?
Not now. We need air, not greetings!
I'll try to hold it from the other side of the wall, while you push from out here. Maybe that'll do it.
You can't --it's too dangerous --
You must carry spare parts --
Not anything built into the chassis. If it hadn't come loose --
If you had a transistor about this size and power output, and a thin enough wire -- -- could you piece it together?
No, it requires such absolute precision --
No, it requires such absolute precision --
A surgeon might...

Oh yes, I'm sure Dr. Duval could. If we had the parts.
Oh yes, I'm sure Dr. Duval could. If we had the parts.
I've got a source. All I have to do is tap it.
Open it! Open it before they get here!
I can't till the hatch is flooded!
No need to get up --
I feel much better now...
Thank you for saving my life.
That's what they pay me for.
That's what they pay me for.
A great deal more than that, I believe...
Such as?
Keeping an eye on Dr. Duval...
Keeping an eye on Dr. Duval...
What gives you that idea?
That's why you're really here. I knew it from the start.
As obvious as that? Our Security people will jump for joy. I suppose Duval's onto me, too?

Well, if you happen to be very fond of him -- even in love with him -- it would certainly affect your point of view.
We better get back to the sub. Every second counts now.
Look! They follow the direction of her glance, are startled to see:
Doctor, what's wrong?
I can't breathe!... I've got to get out!
I can't breathe!... I've got to get out!
It's too late now. We must go on.
Looks like the molecular structure of proteins.
I don't agree. I think we ought to stop and take a sample.
I don't agree. I think we ought to stop and take a sample.
That's not the purpose of this mission. Captain -- keep a straight course -- until you're in the clear.
But that isn't possible.
Not in a sealed vessel like an Artery. Captain -- something must be wrong with your controls!
We can't take a second more.
Captain -- head in the d1rection of the flow and drift with it.
Nothing miraculous about it. Just an interchange of gases. The end product of five hundred million years of Evolution.
You can't believe all that's accidental? That there isn't a Creative Intelligence at work --
What can we do?
Nothing -- against all that force.
That puts us right here... Which means we can head straight for the Sub Arachnoid Cavity.
Yes...
Yes...
If we can go in past the Oculomotor Nerve...
It's against my better Judgment...
Better Judgment?! To wait until the actual operation -- when it may be too late?

I've done all I could with the laser.

All I'm asking is you test it beforehand!

If it won't work, it's beyond my power to fix it. But if it does, there's no telling how long it will hold up. It's a jury rig, at best, and we'll need every second of use we can get out of it. That's why I don't want to put any extra strain on the connections by running unnecessary tests.

As usual, you want everything your way. Except this time there's more than your damned ego at stake.
I know only too well what's in the balance, Doctor. And it's not my ego, damned or otherwise.
The Soul? The finite mind cannot comprehend Infinity. And the Soul which comes from God is Infinite.
Take a close look at your Soul, and your Infinity, and your God out there --
--and certain chemicals involving proteins --
You left something out.
You left something out.
What's that?
What's that?
The Breath of God...
Removal Point? What're you talking about!
We have no alternative. With only six minutes left, we'll just barely make it.
Dr. Duval, you are not going through with this! I absolutely forbid it! I'm responsible for the lives of everyone here! I will not allow you or anyone else to leave this ship!
I'm going to do what I can to save Benes.
The Medieval Philosophers were right... <Man> is the center of the Universe... We stand in the middle of Infinity, between Outer and Inner Space. And there's no limit to either.
You mean Inner Space is endless?
You mean Inner Space is endless?
Everything can be divided in half, no matter how minute.
Only to the naked eye. Those corpuscles -- carrying oxygen -- give the stream its color. But the rest of the plasma's very much like sea water. An ocean of life...
Quite a piece of plumbing.
I'd hate to get lost on that Freeway...
They all lead to the same place -- the Lungs.
Mind letting me in on what's going on out there?
A simple exchange, Mr. Grant. Corpuscles releasing carbon dioxide -- the moment they touch the Wall of the Lung -- in return for oxygen coming through from the other side.

Don't tell me they're refueling...
Don't tell me they're refueling...
Oxygenation...
Just a few cells away from a vast air chamber -- one of the countless Alvioli of the Lung -- and we can't get enough to fill a microscopic tank.
Maybe we can... Skipper, is there a snorkel on this sub?
Isn't there another surgical procedure you can try?
No, there's no other way.
We'll never get there in time, at this rate.
Isn't there another route? So we can by-pass all this?
Isn't there another route? So we can by-pass all this?
Yes... We can transfer over to the Inner Ear, and go by way of the Endolymphatic Duct.

Then why not take it?
"Yet all the suns that light the Corridors of the Universe shine dim, Before the blazing of a Single Thought -- "
"Proclaiming in incandescent glory The myriad Mind of Man..."
How does it look, Doctor?
If I can relieve the pressure on a few key vessels...
Doctor, we've just about had it.
It I can clear this Central Nerve, that <may> be enough...
The ship's good as finished. We'll have to get out on our own! Is there a quick way out?
We could follow the Optic Nerve to the corner of the Eye.
You said there was a quick way out!
What about Dr. Michaels?
What about Dr. Michaels?
It's too late!
We need you for Security purposes, Mr. Grant.
At an operation?
At an operation?
They know they failed to kill Benes. Security thinks they'll try again, first chance they get. We're afraid of medical sabotage -- or surgical assassination.
They know they failed to kill Benes. Security thinks they'll try again, first chance they get. We're afraid of medical sabotage -- or surgical assassination.
Surgical assassination?! But that means you suspect --
Miss Peterson, his Technical Assistant.
How are you, Miss Peterson?
About forty miles an hour.
Well, it seems to me if you reduce a ship to microscopic size -- and the stream remains constant -- we'd take quite a beating.
A what?
A forced joining of an Artery and Vein. Must've happened when Benes was hurt.
If we can't go back, is there an alternate route?
Yes... We can go forward on this course, but it means going directly through the Heart.
That's just dandy. We can't go forward -- and we can't go back.
I'm afraid there's only one thing we can do. Call off the mission.
Tell them to take us out.
If there's any chance --
If there's any chance --
Request removal, Mr. Grant.
Sounds like heavy artillery...
It lays down quite a barrage in a lifetime. Forty million beats.
There it is!
Fasten yourselves in. There should be a tremendous surge when the Heart starts up again.
At this size, I would certainly think so.
If those Corpuscles can take on air, no reason why we can't. All we have to do is hook up the snorkel to that air chamber you were talk1ng about, and when Benes inhales, there should be plenty of pressure to force the oxygen into the tank. How's that sound to you, Skipper?
In a way -- yes. Those are impurities imbedded in the Lung after a lifetime of 'Civilization.' Carbon from smoke and smog -- specks of dust --
Well, we better get on with it.
Yes -- with all that pressure, and suction within --
There's no other way. Tie my safety line to the sub.
All right now -- push the snorkel through as soon as I get inside.
Walt for the lull -- between the time he inhales and exhales.
Grant -- wait a minute -- you're not going to dismantle the wireless?
Just one little transistor and a circuit wire is all it takes.
Just one little transistor and a circuit wire is all it takes.
But that'll knock out our communications! We'll be cutting ourselves off from the outside.
But that'll knock out our communications! We'll be cutting ourselves off from the outside.
They'll still be able to track us by radar, because of the radioactive fuel.
Well, sir? Which is it? The wireless, or Benes' life?
Send the following message...
Looks like the sea, at dawn.
We're safe -- long as it remains that color... We're in the Pleural Sac. It keeps the Lungs from rubbing against the Wall of the Chest up there. When those membranes become inflamed, we wind up with Pleurisy -- and a wracking cough.

Let's hope... So far, somebody's tried to sabotage this mission twice.
Sabotage? I don't understand...
I saw the laser just before we started. It was fastened down securely. You don't suppose what happened was an 'accident?' Any more than my safety line snapping after it was tied off to the sub?

The Lymphatic System drains off excess fluid from the Tissues. Without it, we'd all swell up like balloons. He reaches the console, begins to take out a new chart.
Skipper, you're picking up seaweed -- or whatever it is.
Reticular fibers. We ought to be clear of them soon.
Looks like somebody declared war.
Just what it is. Antibodies, destroying Bacteria -- or any other foreign invader that threatens the System.
They're tracking us Topside. Once they see where we're going, I'm sure they'll take every precaution.
Let's hope they realize the danger. Captain, I'll give you a new compass heading.
Looks like quite a way to go...
No, we should reach the base of the Brain shortly. And from there, it's not far to the site of the injury.
Hold it, Skipper. What happens if we overstay?
Once time's up, De-Miniaturization begins. In a matter of seconds the ship will grow big enough to become a danger to the System. Then White Corpuscles will swarm to destroy it, as they would any invader.

I'm in charge of this mission! You were instructed to take orders from me, not give them!
Sorry, but the situation has changed.
Sorry, but the situation has changed.
Nothing has changed as far as <my> authority goes! He is <not> going to operate! Not in the little time we have left! There's no chance of success! It's sheer suicide for all of us!
I don't believe that.
Why not? Because of his gibberish about GOd and the Soul? Camouflage -- that's all it is -- to blind the gullible like you! And to hide his real identity -- a fanatic whose only purpose is to kill Benes! And you made it possible!
Sorry we had to get you up at this hour, Mr. Grant.
I thought I was on my vacation... What's it all about?
I thought I was on my vacation... What's it all about?
I can't tell you.
I can't tell you.
Where we going?
Where we going?
I can't tell you that either... Excuse me, Mr. Grant, but you've got a smudge on your cheek.
May I?
Go ahead.
What'd you do that for?
I'm married.
I'm married.
And she said it was indelible...
Out of your element, aren't you, Captain?
Sort of.
Sort of.
That makes two of us.
Atomic fuel?
Nothing you could see with the naked eye. But there's a microscopic radio-active particle inside.
If it's no military secret, how can a sub run on a microscopic particle?
They can't reduce nuclear fuel. But once the Reactor's Miniaturized -- along with the submarine -- a microscopic particle should emit enough energy to activate it.

Positions, please. And strap yourselves in.
Any reserve air?
Enough to breathe, but that's all.
I've come up against fanatics before, and Duval just doesn't fit the pattern. I'm going out there, Skipper. Maybe I can be of some help...
Remember -- we can't take more than five minutes to get out.
What happened?
Dr. Michaels... He went berserk...
Dr. Michaels... He went berserk...
Berserk nothing. He's the one who's been sabotaging the mission... Get this on. Hurry!
Come on -- it's no use!
We can get out through the Lab Section.
Who, me? Oh, no! Don't bother about me! We're not hurt! Isn't that right, Skipper?
Uh -- what?
Uh -- what?
We feel great, don't we? Just <great>?!
We feel great, don't we? Just <great>?!
Oh -- sure, sure! Never better!
Oh -- sure, sure! Never better!
Nothing wrong with us! Not a thing! We're fine -- just fine!
What is it, Skipper?
We're losing pressure in the Flotation Tanks. Check the Manual, right over there.
Yes, there is.
Could I run a tube through that Wall, without harming Benes?
Thirty-two minutes left... But chances are we won't have to wait that long for try-number three.
Look at those Walls up ahead!
What's wrong, Skipper?
What I was afraid would happen. The stuff we passed through -- that looked like seaweed --
How's it look?
I could use a lawnmower...
Even so, because of our size -- I mean lack of it -- we'll still be cruising mighty fast. We'll be smashed to bits if there's any turbulence --
The only danger of turbulence is in the Heart -- and we're not going through it. Once in the Carotid Artery, we'll remain in the Arterial System... until we reach the point of damage -- -- where Dr. Duval will attempt to dissolve the clot with a laser beam. After the operation, we'll return by way of the Venous System -- -- until we
Captain, how will you be able to follow my charts -- --from up there?
On the Repeater.
That's it...
Looks simple to operate.
I'll never find my way through that.
I'll guide you, once we're in the Heart.
Well, that takes care of the valve. It was probably caused by that electric shock.
Was there any damage?
Was there any damage?
Not to the valve. But we've lost too much air to make it the rest of the way.
It's a dangerous procedure. If I miss the timing, we could explode the tanks... But I'm willing to try it.
Yes, by all means. We must try it.
We could never fight that current it's physically impossible.
Then don't drift down further.
Then don't drift down further.
I'll do what I can.

My dad. No question.
Oh, yeah. I didn't know my dad. Well, I knew him, till I was six. He went and married another woman, had more kids. Every six years or so he'd do it again -- new city, new family.
He was setting up franchises. My father never went to college, so it was really important that I go.

I had a premonition about the Route 18 pile up... I saved some people. And now I think Death is after me.
Nice work. Maybe if you're real lucky, you'll wind up in here with me. But I doubt you'll survive that long.
It's not just about me. Someone I saved died last night in a freak accident. What if the others are in danger, too?
Well, if you put them on the list, they're already tits up.
Well, if you put them on the list, they're already tits up.
What list?
What list?
Death's list. The precise order you're going to die in.
The survivors of Flight 180 died in the exact order they were originally meant to die in the plane crash. That was Death's original design.
Exact order? Then I'm next! I was meant to die with my friends, so I'm next!
Officer Burke pulled me away from the crash that killed my friends.
Congratufuckinglations. That makes you last to go. But don't worry, once the others are dead, it'll come back for you. Always does.
Congratufuckinglations. That makes you last to go. But don't worry, once the others are dead, it'll come back for you. Always does.
That still doesn't make sense. You said you die in the same order you were originally meant to. But Evan Shaeffer died last in my premonition, not first.
That's good. Get all your tears out now, you'll need your eyes. For the signs.
Signs?
Signs?
If you have the same power as Alex, you'll be seeing signs soon. When you see anything creepy or ominous, an in-your-face irony kinda thing? Don't ignore it. It usually means the difference between life and death.

The songs on the radio. But wait. I don't understand. Why is this even happening to me?
The songs on the radio. But wait. I don't understand. Why is this even happening to me?
That's what Alex used to ask himself right up until...
I didn't beat it; I hid from it. If you were smart you'd put a down payment on a burial plot and say goodbye to the dog, because what little life you have left is over as you know it. Don't make new friends, don't fall in love, and don't ever bother trying to save others. That's the worst killer of them all.
How can you say that? What kind of monster are you?
The second one just dies. A 16 year old kid.
I hope you're ready for this.
You have to tell us now.
I...I...
I was driving a white van. It must've gone out of control because it crashed into a lake and I drowned. It was...horrible.
You were there?
You were there?
I can practically taste the water in my throat. And something else. The smell of flowers...
I can practically taste the water in my throat. And something else. The smell of flowers...
Then it wasn't just a sign. It was a premonition?
Please, what else could it mean?
So if you give us the pregnant lady's number, we can warn her about the lake and she'll live long enough to have the baby.
So if you give us the pregnant lady's number, we can warn her about the lake and she'll live long enough to have the baby.
So let's do it.
What about that?
How you doing in there, hero?
What are you doing? You're going to kill us!
No. If anyone dies from a crash now, it'll be me. But I can't die if Eugene and Isabella are still alive. I'm last on Death's list.
No. If anyone dies from a crash now, it'll be me. But I can't die if Eugene and Isabella are still alive. I'm last on Death's list.
Are you crazy? What makes you think you'd survive?
Are you crazy? What makes you think you'd survive?
What happened when Eugene tried to kill himself out of turn?
What happened when Eugene tried to kill himself out of turn?
Six duds in a row.
Six duds in a row.
And when it was Rory's turn to die, and Thomas was in the way?
This makes no sense. Isabella was supposed to crash her van into a lake. Could we have altered her destiny when we had her arrested?
I don't think so. Alex's premonitions happened exactly as he saw them no matter how much we tried to change it.
What did you see? What am I looking for?
No, it's not here. This one was different. More like the pile up and the van going into the lake.
Another premonition?
Yes. I was in a hospital. There was screaming... A nurse was choking me. I couldn't tell what she looked like, but the name tag was right in my face. Kalarjian.
What do you want me to do?
Speed up.
Speed up.
Yeah, fuck 'em. No offense.
What did you see?
I was dead. And came back to life. An EEG machine. Where's Eugene?
No! It can't be.
I have to save Eugene!
A mortician. He seemed to know a hell of a lot more about death than he ever told us.
Should we knock?
Should we knock?
He probably already knows we're coming.
Remember the onramp? There was a pregnant woman in a white delivery van.
Holy shit. He said "only new life can defeat death." If she gives birth to a baby that was never meant to be born, a brand new soul that was never part of Death's Design...
Make sure all these people will be at the meeting tonight.
Taken care of.
Here we go. The vehicle's a delivery van registered to Jorge and Isabella Cruz. And Christ, there's almost a dozen domestic disturbance complaints on these two.
We need to hurry.
Then the only way to survive is to get to the hospital and protect Eugene and Isabella for as long as we can.
If only Alex and I had done that with the others, Alex might still be...
A guard grabbed me before I could find Eugene.
Don't sweat it. It's over.
Don't sweat it. It's over.
She had the baby?
Jury duty? That's randomly selected by social security numbers.
Random, sure.
Random, sure.
What, you think Death planned for each of us to die in the pile up weeks ago? You're nuts.
Um, Clear? I'm sorry...about before. I...
Your entire world view just went out the window. I couldn't expect a religious conversation overnight. We'll get through this. I promise.
I'm not sure I understand.
Being alive after our time caused an outward ripple - a rift in Death's design.
So if you never got off the plane, none of us would be alive in the first place.
That's why Death is working backwards. It's tying up all the loose ends, sealing the rift once and for all This chapter of the screenplay contains scene that do not appear or occur elsewhere in the final movie. In order to maintain the integrity of the screenplay, it has not been edited.
The only reason he was on Route 18 was because he own the lottery and had to collect the winnings.
That lucky bastard.
That lucky bastard.
What about the rest of you? Kimberly, you were driving to Daytona. Was Route 18 your first choice?
I had tickets to go, but one day I'm in Paris, trippin' on acid, sippin' lattes an' such, and this dude gets whacked by a falling sign.
Carter.
Carter.
Freaked me out so bad I hid in a shopping cart for four hours. 'Course, missed the show...
Freaked me out so bad I hid in a shopping cart for four hours. 'Course, missed the show...
What about you, Kimberly? Did you anyone from Flight-?
Dano, shouldn't we go back and help your mother?
Blow me.
Calm down, Kimmy. It's not drugs, just weed.
Yeah, you should have specified.
A Trans Am. That shit went out with New Kids on the Block.
Yeah. Who does he think he is? Knight Rider?
Yeah. Who does he think he is? Knight Rider?
Who?
Dano, shouldn't we stop and help your mother?
Blow me. Yellow means go, Kimberly.
Dano, shouldn't we stop and help your mother?
Blow me. Yellow means go, Kimmy.
Tell me you didn't start up on that Flight 180 shit again. Did you?
Of course not. That would be irresponsible and unprofessional.
Look, you weren't there. It was weird. She knew that log truck was gonna cause an accident, she knew. Never mind.
I thought we were finished with this bullshit. This is police work, not the psychic Hot Line.
You've made your point.
Good. Cause we just got some new info and I don't need you getting freaky on me.
Good. Cause we just got some new info and I don't need you getting freaky on me.
What?
What?
Evan Shaeffer's dead. Guess he wasn't as lucky as we thought.
What do you mean "grand theft auto?" This is insane.
Hopefully the district judge can straighten it all out by Monday morning.
Hopefully the district judge can straighten it all out by Monday morning.
Jorge. When I get out of here I'm going to sue his cheating ass off.
Damn, they always stick me with the clunker.
Take my van!
Please. It's not going to wait.
I've got to stop and help those people.
I've got to stop and help those people.
Do you want to deliver this baby?
What?
I'm Officer Burke. I'm looking for an Isabella Cruz.
Are you Jorge Cruz?
Maybe. What's this about?
Maybe. What's this about?
May we come in?
May we come in?
No. What's this about?
We had a fight. Some things got broken, the dog went crazy, she left me. Wouldn't say where she was going.
What was the fight about?
What was the fight about?
Take a guess.
Take a guess.
Does she have a cell phone? A way we can contact her?
Does she have a cell phone? A way we can contact her?
She did.
First I'm stuck with Jury Duty, now this nonsense.
Yeah, I hate to love and leave ya, but I've been over this X-Files shit since the sixth season.
This can't be happening. My career's at a peak, I finally met a cute guy, I just bought a new house...
Just shut the fuck up and maybe you'll live.
Last July I dialed a wrong number and got a radio station by accident. They asked me what number means "good luck" in Jewish.
Eighteen. And it's "Hebrew".
Eighteen. And it's "Hebrew".
Anyway, I guessed it right and won these.
Here's what I don't get. For nine months, Death does all this shit to make sure I win these tickets and end up on Route 18 at exactly the right time for the pile up...
Yeah?
Yeah?
But why single me out? What am I in the great scheme of things? You'd think I stepped off Flight 180 or something... Fucking weird, man.
I got that beat. So like, last May, I was supposed to stay at this cheesy bed and breakfast in Pennsylvania. There was a major gas leak no one knew about and all the guests suffocated during the night.
Yeah, so what happened?
Yeah, so what happened?
I never mad it. The Greyhound bus I was on splattered some chick all over the road and we had to stop.
What's going on here?
There's going to be a pile up. Logs. Bodies everywhere. I saw it happen. It happened.
THAT's the truck that's going to kill everyone!
Alright miss, calm down. I just need this lane open. I need you to pull your vehicle onto the shoulder!
Alright miss, calm down. I just need this lane open. I need you to pull your vehicle onto the shoulder!
You're not listening to me! You have to do something!
Tell me again how it started.
Like I said, it was like I was there. I remember everything. The sounds of the crashes, the smells, the look on Shaina's face...
Like I said, it was like I was there. I remember everything. The sounds of the crashes, the smells, the look on Shaina's face...
Do you remember what triggered it all?
Do you remember what triggered it all?
The log truck...and everybody I guess. Everyone was driving like a maniac. And somehow I knew something horrible was going to happen, even before it did.
Billboards about accidents. Kids yelling "pile up" for no reason. It all felt...just wrong. Just like...
Like what?
You mean Alex Browning.
...My Premonition was just like his.
I tried calling last night but your father --
Evan Shaeffer's dead.
I know. I've gotten calls all morning from everyone who was on the onramp. We're all meeting at my apartment tonight.
Then you believe all this?? That Death is working off a list?
I didn't. Until I was dispatched to clean up one of the Flight 180 survivors.
Clean up? I don't...
Pigeons... It's a sign! If Clear's right about the order, then Nora and Tim are going to be attacked by Pigeons!
I'm not following you --
I'm not following you --
They're next on the list. We have to find them.
Turn around. The cleaning woman said they're at the dentist's. 14th and Main.
Hold on.
Nora's not coming. She refuses to leave her son.
We have to tell her she's in danger!
We have to tell her she's in danger!
I did. And right now, I don't think she cares.
This is cheery.
Who is this guy, anyway?
New life defeats death? Follow the signs? Where the hell did you find that guy?
Yeah, I thought he was supposed to be helpful.
It throws the entire Death list out of whack. And a new list has to be rewritten from scratch. We all start over with a clean slate.
It sounds all well and good, but what if we're wrong?
Shit, I don't have her number. She was never interviewed. She took off right after the accident.
How are we going to find her? There must be thousands of white vans in this state.
How are we going to find her? There must be thousands of white vans in this state.
Hey, I'm a police officer, remember?
Whoa, nine months?
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Guys, let's not panic. Isabella's safe.
How do you know?
How do you know?
You said she was going to drive into a lake. How can she when she's in protective custody?
Stop it, don't move him!
He can't breathe damn it. I think his lung's collapsed!
Um, Kimberly? This is a neighborhood. You may wanna slow it down.
Don't worry. Nothing can happen to us.
Don't worry. Nothing can happen to us.
I wasn't worried about us.
Kalarjian?
I think a nurse named Kalarjian is going to choke Isabella to death!
Shouldn't we pull over?
No time. Keep going. I wouldn't know how to explain any of this anyway.
Are you okay? You just face planted!
I know how it feels to be dead.
But it's over. Isabella's baby was the key. You saw her die and everything, right?
I don't...what if I made a mistake?
I don't...what if I made a mistake?
Impossible. She was on the onramp.
I'm not sure... I don't think Isabella was ever destined to die in the pile- up.
Then what's the premonition of the lake supposed to mean?
You can't cheat destiny. I know what I have to do to save us. I have to die.
That's crazy. You can't give up now. We can still fight this thing.
Welcome back. We did it. For real.
I know. I can feel it too.
For God's sake, leave him alone, Dad.
Yeah, don't make me cite you for harassment.
Want me to drive?
No, I'm good.
This trip better be worth it. What's the guy-girl ratio again?
Get ready to smile, five guys per girl.
Get ready to smile, five guys per girl.
I can live with thaaaa --
What's the chance of finding a nice mature guy once we get to Daytona?
How does a nice mature fuck sound?
What is it? What are you?
There's going to be a huge accident! Everyone's gonna die. All of us! I saw it!
What is it? What are you?
There's going to be a huge accident! Everyone's gonna die, all of us, I saw it!
Relax, you need to chill the fuck out.
Highway to Hell, Highway to Hell.
Highway to Hell, Highway to Hell.
For Christ sakes girl, take a breath.
More than that. All the songs on the radio were about car crashes. Some kid's banging toy cars together. She was dialing her cell phone with her headset on. His car was leaking oil all over the road.
Hey, don't be knockin' the Chevette.
The best way to get to Yankee Stadium is Route 18.
I don't know what's weirder, the dialing a wrong number part or that Death would set you up nine months in advance.
Can I ask you a question?
Sure.
Sure.
When I die. Is it gonna hurt?
When I die. Is it gonna hurt?
I...I don't know.
And you're gonna die after me, right?
I guess so.
I guess so.
Would you take these? And if I die... Could you throw all my drugs out? Paraphernalia, porno, you know... Anything that would break my mom's heart.
Thanks, Dad. I'll call you.
You have everything, Kimberly? Credit card, cell phone, AAA card?
You have everything, Kimberly? Credit card, cell phone, AAA card?
Relax, Dad. It's Daytona, not Mongolia.
Relax, Dad. It's Daytona, not Mongolia.
Fix-A-flat? Road flares? Sunblock? Mace?
I know this is the first time we've been apart since. But everything's gonna be okay.
I know, honey. I just --
Your mother would have been so proud of the way you've handled yourself through all of this...
I know, Dad.
Kimberly? It's Dad.
Hey, Dad. What's up?
Your car's leaking either transmission or brake fluid. I want you to have it checked ASAP at a gas station.
You got it, Dad. I'll call you if I have a problem.
You got it, Dad. I'll call you if I have a problem.
I mean it. Take care of it.
I mean it. Take care of it.
I will, Dad. Bye, luv you.
I know it's crazy, but I'm really scared for the others. I've got this terrible feeling.
What feeling?
What feeling?
That it's not over yet.
I'm sorry. I'm just so happy that you're safe.
I love you too, Dad. Goodnight.
There were so many times I didn't think I could last another day. I can't even tell you some of the things I thought about.
I used to have those feelings, too. But that's when I'd think of Mom. Her strength...and courage. And I'd pray that maybe I'd grow up to be as brave as she was. And the bad thoughts would go away.
I used to have those feelings, too. But that's when I'd think of Mom. Her strength...and courage. And I'd pray that maybe I'd grow up to be as brave as she was. And the bad thoughts would go away.
I don't know what I'd do if I lost you.
Damn, it really hurts, Mom.
I know, we'll be there soon.
What on Earth are they doing?
Who am I, David Blane?
You're all certifiable, you know that? I can't believe I've been listening to this crap. Come on, Tim, let's go outside.
Jeez, Mom, stop trippin'.
Mom?
Yeah?
Yeah?
You think... You think those guys were b.s.-ing us today or what?
You think the tooth fairy's gonna come tonight? I'm thinkin' like fifteen bucks.
Nice try, kiddo.
How would I know? You think I'm some sort of...
He's not a witch.
It's only the end of June.
Yeah, but everything's always in transition. If you focus, even now, one week into summer... you can feel Autumn coming. Almost like bein' able... to see the future.
You went there? I've wanted to go there, but I thought it was off limits.
It is. But that didn't stop me. Shouldn't stop you.
Not a likeness. It's how you make me feel, Alex.
I'm... really sorry.
I'm... really sorry.
Like you, the sculpture doesn't even know what, or why, it is. Reluctant to take form. And, yet, creating an absolute but incomprehensible attraction.
That's why I was there last night.
I've never dealt with death before. I wasn't alive when my grandparents died. I wish I could know. I mean, all this... could just be in our heads. Now it feels like it's everywhere.
I've never dealt with death before. I wasn't alive when my grandparents died. I wish I could know. I mean, all this... could just be in our heads. Now it feels like it's everywhere.
"It?"
"It?"
What if Tod... is just the first... of us?
Is that something you're "feeling?"
I don't know. I wish I could just see him... one more time, then, maybe... I would know.
I don't know. I wish I could just see him... one more time, then, maybe... I would know.
Then, let's go see him!
This place?!
Doin' somethin' I'm not supposed to.
That... him?
I think. But why'd they make him up like... Michael Jackson?
I think. But why'd they make him up like... Michael Jackson?
That's him, but... he's not here.
Ahhh! fuck! You fucking asshole. You think this is funny, you fucking dick? Tod, if you're not dead I'm gonna fucking kill you!
Ohmygod! OHMYGOD! OHMYGOD! He's not dead?
He said Death has a design. Even before he said that I had been seeing patterns.
As in flannels and plaids?
How many died on Flight 180? From our group?
Thirty-nine.
Thirty-nine.
Remember the gate number?
No.
Thirty-nine.
Remember the departure time?
Like... 4:25.
4:25.
Right. April 25th.
Right. April 25th.
Wait. I thought you meant the time of your birth. Four/Twenty-five, as in, month and day... that's a reach.
I'm not just layin' down a bunch of math here, with this. I'm talking about indications... omens... that day, that we were meant to die. That, if, we have been aware of... would have saved everyone on the plane.
That's total bullshit. You can find death omens anywhere you want to.
I don't understand... did you see Tod die? Did it happen again, like on the plane?
No, but it might as well be the same thing. This was a message... from someone, or something... hinting... at the design.
No, but it might as well be the same thing. This was a message... from someone, or something... hinting... at the design.
Alex, on the plane... you must have experienced... some kind of hyper awareness. But here... you're suggesting Tod's death... and maybe our own... will happen because of... an active Presence.
Most kids do, I guess.
Most kids never have it happen.
Those guys are probably fifteen minutes away.
No.. I mean, I don't have anything on me. This won't be safe.
No.. I mean, I don't have anything on me. This won't be safe.
Nothing is... anymore.
I can't go home. After Lewton's, they'll be after me.
We're takin' you to a cabin in the woods, it's only a couple miles from my house. Keep off the highways, they'll be lookin' for us.
Billy told the F.B.I. he saw you runnin' away from her house.
They blame me for everything. Her, Tod, the plane crash...
Stop the car!
Let us out!
Can't you open the door?!
Easy, Billy, just open it.
Carter, get out!
Don't do it! Don't do it!
Get out! Get out of the car! Get out of the fuckin' car!
Get out! Get out of the car!
Police are coming.
That's why It skipped Carter and went to the next one in the path of the explosion; Billy.
You know what to do.
No! No! Don't!
No! No! Don't!
When I do this.. it'll have skipped you... and it'll all be over.
I'll remove him.
Fuck you! I'll remove myself!
You're payin' for my trip, Browning!
I wish you were on the plane!
Hope you don't think, Browning, that because my name ain't on this wall... that I owe you anything.
I don't.
I don't.
All I owe is these people. To live my life to the fullest.
We're losing our favorite teacher.
Look, there's something you should all know.
Alright, Browning, you fuckin' warlock... did you know about Ms. Lewton, or what?
Why do you think I was hiding?
Is knowing going to make it easier? It makes it harder.
You get off havin' control over me. Let me choose how to deal with it.
You get off havin' control over me. Let me choose how to deal with it.
It doesn't matter who's next... we're all on the same list.
What's your fuckin' worry? If it's not your time...? I could get nailed runnin' this red light and you all wouldn't get shit! Only me, right?
No!
You should have been next. After Lewton, you should've been next. That's the only pattern. You should be dead.
You're the fuckin' devil.
You're the fuckin' devil.
But I saved him. I intervened. Just like the plane. That's the design.
My intervention in the death of 180 survivors will cheat the design.
"Intervention?" What are you, God now?!
"Intervention?" What are you, God now?!
Of course not! Gods aren't afraid to die! Gods don't die! We do!
Man, that is one George Michael notch from being gay.
Dude, get wisdom. We're about to board a seven hour flight. The toilets in coach are barely ventilated closets. What if your body wants that airplane food out of your system and you have to go torque a wicked cable and then right after you walks in Christa or Blake? You want them to associate with you with that reflexive gag and the watery
Fag.
C'mon, man, like you really thought you were gonna tittie fuck 'em over Greenland, or something?
C'mon, man, like you really thought you were gonna tittie fuck 'em over Greenland, or something?
Because of you, I gotta sit here and watch fuckin' "Stepmom."
And then the cabin banged and the left side exploded. The the whole plane... blew up. It was so real. Exactly how everything goes.
Been on many planes that blew up, have you?
Me, too. But my dad doesn't understand. When he's better; you and me, road trip to the City. Catch the Yanks.
That's a plan.
I got this... feeling... a weird feeling... I can't explain it...
Did you take any sedatives before boarding, or on the plane. Sleeping pills?
Did you take any sedatives before boarding, or on the plane. Sleeping pills?
No. I saw it. I saw it!
I believe that... Ms. Lewton's next.
"Next?"
"Next?"
Yes... see, there's this... pattern... that's occuring.
Yes... see, there's this... pattern... that's occuring.
Oh, you've noticed it, too?
Alex... can you promise me that no one else will die?
No... I can't. As long as I'm in here, it's outta my control.
I'm... a friend of his. His best friend. See, his father...
I know who you are.
Cuticle lacerations.
Why would he pull at the wire if he were committing suicide?
His father's pretty fucked up with denial. Maybe he couldn't deal with the thought of an other accident... taking another son.
In Death...
... there are no accidents. No coincidencess. No mishaps. And no... escapes.
You saying Tod did kill himself?
You may not realize it, but we're all just a mouse that a cat has by its tail. Every single move we make, from the mundane to the monumental... the red light we stop at, or run; the people we have sex with, or won't with us; the airplane we ride, or walk out of... is all a part of Death's sadistic design leading
Design?
I'm sorry we broke in.
No harm. No foul.
And don't pass on the right.
Billy! I'm gettin' a vision! You're the next one...
Billy! I'm gettin' a vision! You're the next one...
Hey, man, why'd you say that?!
Hey, man, why'd you say that?!
'Cause if you say another word, I'm gonna fuckn' kill ya!
Please tell me I'm gonna get to see the Jets win the Super Bowl.
Me, right? That's why you're not saying.
Shoulda' felt up Tammy in the pool, that time...
Whatta' you whinin' about? He said I'm next.
It broke!
No one's that strong.
What are you doing?
Terry's name should be on this wall.
So, why'd you want us to meet you here? Now?
They're watching me, see if I go to Alex.
He didn't say nothin'. Just drive.
You have a responsibility to tell me.
Knock it off!
May as well go out under my own free will, right?
May as well go out under my own free will, right?
Not with us in the fuckin' car!
Get control of yourself!
That's what I'm doin'!
That's what I'm doin'!
I know what you're doing! It's alright to be scared, Carter. You don't have to prove to us how big your balls are. Not now.
I know what you're doing! It's alright to be scared, Carter. You don't have to prove to us how big your balls are. Not now.
I'm not afraid! I DECIDE WHEN IT'S TIME! I control my life! I control my death!
SHUT UP, BILLY!
WE DON'T NEED THIS NOW!
You guys are real... aren't you?
Huh?
Huh?
Sorry, I mean... I talk to people all the time... I know a lot of them aren't there. But this is real, isn't it? You're taking me home now?
Sorry, I mean... I talk to people all the time... I know a lot of them aren't there. But this is real, isn't it? You're taking me home now?
That's right, buddy.
I gotta tell you, it's just luck you guys came when you did. They move us around a lot... We only been at that camp a week. Got a smoke?
No.
No.
What kind of raggedy-ass rescue you call this?
You mean the snake?
Yeah. It's not hard once you get the hang of it. In the wrist. Anyway, I did what I always do when I get one...
Yeah. It's not hard once you get the hang of it. In the wrist. Anyway, I did what I always do when I get one...
What's that?
What's that?
Put it in the guard's barracks. Man they got pissed. They beat the crap out of me, but... it's kind of a tradition. You oughta see 'em run around.
Wow!
What just happened?
Your buddy made it out last night. The place went apeshit.
Really? How come he didn't take me?
Really? How come he didn't take me?
Maybe because you're shot in the leg.

Oh, yeah. Listen, how long do they keep you in this disease hole?
Hell. This is just like fucking Star Wars, man!
Star Wars?
... and there's this guy with a black helmet and cape, right, and he's got this sword... except it's not a sword, it's light...
There's the Mekong.
This clown almost blew mission security on the street. I'm not jumping with him.
Clown? Now back up there, buddy...
Ever do this from a jet?
No.
Again.

Start over.

We're leaving tonight, not in a week.
Yeah. Why not?
You break your leg, I'll have to shoot you.
You read me, Brewer?
Read you.

Home on my strobe.
You okay?
Keep it down, man. I got problems.

Cocktail party. Uh huh, right. Let's saddle up.
Where's your stuff?
That's it? Some C-4, a map and a knife?
There's a compass in the handle.
And a beat-to-shit AK? Every twelve-year-old in Nam's got one of those.
Exactly.
You wanna know why I stood up for this show?
No.
No.
I was in the brig. They gave me a deal. I blew up this Colonel's golf cart with an M-19. He wasn't in it or anything... it was the symbolic value. Seemed like a good idea at the time.

No cigarettes.

I had it cupped.
What's this stuff on the rice?
Fermented fish sauce.
Why would they send us to a deserted camp?
Who cares? Let's just do it and get out. Go have a Jacuzzi and get laid in Bangkok. Know what I mean?
We'll check it out.
How come we didn't just drop near the camp... save this hassle?

That guy's not going to make it.
Nothing we can do, man.

You take pictures and split. I'm going in.
You better take off.
Ain't you coming with us, sweet thing?
Are they going to torture us?
Yes.
Yes.
What... whattaya do?
Gawd, you look awful.
You comin'?
You comin'?
Hold your pantyhose. Here, gimme a hand.
Can you handle the door gun?

You're gonna love it.
How much we got left in that minigun?
I'm Rambo. This is Brewer. Her name is Co.
It means "virgin." My mother was comedian.
You really got a Masters Degree?
Sure. I only sound like forty-year- old in your language.
How do we get upriver?
I have arranged transportation. We meet soon. But I think you to be disappointed.
I have arranged transportation. We meet soon. But I think you to be disappointed.
Why's that?
Why's that?
I go up to this camp two months ago. Nobody there. Empty for years.
Where did you find this clown?
I thought he was with you.
I thought he was with you.
Crazy motherfucker.
How did you get started working for the spooks?
Spooks?
Spooks?
Intelligence work.

Oh. They talk to me at university before fall of Saigon. Make deal.

Yes. But I lose many merits in next life. Very bad.

Why'd they want us?

Christ. How'd you get here?
Took bus, most of way. I knew you would come here.

I couldn't get you in.
Yes you can.
How?
Look, Co...
Why you don't feel love? Not allowed? Dead inside, maybe? You make yourself dead already so they can't kill you? In-vulnerabo? Bullshit!
What was that?
Minigun. Come on. Let's move. He's coming in on our open side.
John. My name is John.
It doesn't hurt. Why doesn't it hurt?
Alternate LZ Zulu Sierra at 0500. It says "May have heat. Don't be late. All our love."
Let's get that tent down!
Stay on your heading, Captain.
Sorry, Sir. Can't do it.

That's an order.

Sorry, Sir.
You pathetic scum.
Well, if there weren't POWs before, there are now.
I don't work with spooks. Not after that op in Cambodia.

Memo E-7 on top will cover the details. An abandoned Vietnamese Army base in the North-central highlands may have a compound used as an internment camp. As you can see the intelligence is soft. These LANDSAT photos show huts... barracks. It could be anything.
What's the plan?
What's the plan?
This operation is in two phases. Recon and rescue. You are phase one. Your two-man team will probe the site, confirm the presence of American POWs, if any, make photographic and tactical observations, then proceed to the extraction point without engaging the enemy.

We just take pictures?

Don't look so disappointed. It should be hairy enough... even for you.
I didn't know you were a stick man, Rambo.
I was crossed-trained in gunships.
All this is for us?
That's right.
He's giving them a run for their money. Says here they've got two Hueys from Danang. I didn't know those dinks had Hueys.
Half their air force is our stuff. Captured.

... and then he, uh... took the other one.

How long have you been setting up?
About 22 hours on site.
About 22 hours on site.
Nice work.
How long before you're fully on line?
Couple hours. Let me buy you a coffee.
You think they'll find any?
POWs? I don't know. But either way it'll get that subcommittee off our necks. Cream?
POWs? I don't know. But either way it'll get that subcommittee off our necks. Cream?
Black. No sugar.
Black. No sugar.
The League of Families leans on Congress. Then they lean on us. Like we don't have enough to worry about in a dozen dirtwater countries. Damnit!
What's up?
Listen, Kirkhill. I'm a bit of a fifth wheel in your setup here... I thought I'd go out with the extraction team tonight. Unless you have an objection.

It's not necessary.

I know.

That's a pretty hairy ride. Full Colonels are supposed to be above that sort of thing.
I know...
Have fun.
Take your time.
Look, Colonel... we're all adults here. This is a war. A very quiet, very intense war. People get sacrificed.
Look, Colonel... we're all adults here. This is a war. A very quiet, very intense war. People get sacrificed.
Not my people.
But you're right... some people do get sacrificed. Now tell me why you pulled the plug.
You think I'm some whacko? I like to hurt people? I'm doing a job here. If I knew what's right or wrong I'd be a goddamned priest, right? So I follow directives... I do what I'm told. It's simple. If your boy had done what he was told, there wouldn't be a problem.

Don't dance me, Kirkhill. You'll be walking funny.
Look, it was a screw-up, alright? They weren't supposed to find anything. We thought that camp was empty.
This mission was a scam from the word go?
This mission was a scam from the word go?
Word came down... they wanted an answer. And they knew the answer they wanted: no POWs. But it had to look good. Best effort. The whole dog-and-pony show.
Rambo and Brewer were selected as write-offs.
It was clean. Very clean... Rambo was a decorated Vietnam vet, a former POW himself... if he came out and said "No POWs" the sub-committee would buy it. He gets himself caught he's a private citizen, a whacko, acting on his own. If he gets proof, it gets lost somewhere between here and D.C. Airtight. But no... Rambo's gotta be a hero. Thinks he's

"Terminate with extreme prejudice."
"Terminate with extreme prejudice."
That's a crock. We don't say that. Do you have any idea the shitstorm if he'd gotten back with that guy? If it went public? The White House would have to act through channels. We're talking ransom. Four billion bucks in war reparations to Vietnam to get the others back. That's billion, Colonel. With a "B". For a few guys that've had their brains
So there never was a Phase Two rescue team?
Of course not. You can't get approval to rescue a kitten from a tree after Tehran.
You're out of your depth, Trautman. Way out. I'm acting correctly here. Not you. Not your gung-ho jungle ace. It's over. Walk away.
It's not over. You made one mistake.
It's not over. You made one mistake.
What that?
Who're you?

De Fravio. Dave De Fravio. Lieutenant... Air Force.
Hello, John.
Colonel.
Colonel.
Mind if I sit down?
I hear you're not enjoying it here.
I could take it or leave it.
Seems like I'm always pulling you out of some goddamn toilet or other, doesn't it?
Am I out of here?
Am I out of here?
That depends on you. Christ, look at you. I give you this easy duty until I can get you an assignment... all you have to do is eat ice cream and watch soap operas... and you have to make it Rambo's last stand.

There were treating me like a headcase.
There were treating me like a headcase.
Hard to believe. You shoot up one little town in Oregon with a fifty caliber machine gun... one little dogpatch town... and everybody figures your wrapper's broken. No sense of humor. What did you expect? An engraved plague from the chamber of commerce?
This your stuff?
That's it. My life.
Hardcore outfit. The best I ever trained.
Those men are all dead.
Those men are all dead.
You're not.
Congressional Medal of Honor.
Yeah. Big time.
Yeah. Big time.
Plus, what else? Two Silver Stars, four Bronze Stars, two Soldier's Medals, four Vietnamese Crosses of Gallantry and... uh, a handful of Purple Hearts.

What did you want?

I just wanted... I don't know... after all that... I just wanted one person, one person, to come up to me and say "you did good, John." And mean it. That's all. After all that.
I just wanted... I don't know... after all that... I just wanted one person, one person, to come up to me and say "you did good, John." And mean it. That's all. After all that.
You just picked that wrong war to be a hero in.
We left some people behind there, John... POWs.
This just occurred to somebody, now?
Listen up. You two are married as of now. Get used to it.
I say we tape him to a chair.
Let's do it.
Keep it clean, Rambo, or I'll nail your hide to the shed.
Keep it clean, Rambo, or I'll nail your hide to the shed.
You got it, sir.
This will last you one year after which you have the option to renew if... you like at a membership discount.
But now it's free, right?
But now it's free, right?
Yeah.
You know, I think I... ordered some just the other day.
Well did you or didn't you?
Well did you or didn't you?
Yes! They'll be in soon.
Yes! They'll be in soon.
Well, I guess I'll come back then.
I like your nails. Where did you get them done?
Ah... I do them myself. I used to work in a beauty parlor.
I've never been in an apartment above a store. You always pass them on the street but you never think anyone really lives in them.
Can I get you anything...coffee... tea...a little tequilla?
Can I get you anything...coffee... tea...a little tequilla?
No, thank you.
Will it hurt?
That all depends on you. ...Sure you don't want a drink?
...So he says to me, "you'll never find another man like me"...I said, "please, men like you have one hand on their dicks and the other hand on their mother's leg... I said, there's the door - take a trip.
You threw him out?
My parents were divorced.
It's an awful thing, let me tell you. My Aunt used to say, "divorce is the sister-in-law of death".
...SO...anybody special in your life?
Do I look like I have someone special?
Well, don't say it like that. It's not so...ya know, crazy an idea. You are a healthy woman... You hold a steady job. Ya not crossed eyed or anything...
Well, there's nobody special!
Well, there's nobody special!
Fine.
Fine.
I mean, it's not easy in this day and age.

It's a disgusting process. You haven't missed anything.
...My mother calls every week. Like a recurring nightmare. "So, have you met anyone?"..."No mom".. "So what's going to happen?"... "I don't know Mom"... I only thank God I moved out.
I can't believe you lived with her for that long. If I had to live with my mother, I'd stab myself six times.

I think some people are meant to be alone. Maybe I was a man in a former life and I used women for pleasure so now I'm paying for it - which would be fine, if I could just remember some of the pleasure parts...

I don't understand you. What is the problem?
I don't understand you. What is the problem?
I don't feel like I make any impression on people... At office parties I spend my time re-arranging the hors d'oeuvres as people eat them, so the platters will always look full. I don't start conversations because I have no idea how to end them...I think I'm just meant to live in the background of things.

You know, let me tell you something! I'm not that kind of person. I don't do people favors. If I talk to you it's because I want to. So we're not all ...uh...Jerri Hall...Big deal... What a boring world if we were. You do the best you can with what you got. You're not so so invisible, ya know... You want make an impression?
Really?
Really?
Yeah!
Oh, no..I have to get home...
The nails!! Watch the nails!!... Listen, you still have to eat.
No really..I can't.
Hey? What did I tell you? Why don't you come? It's just dinner. You'll have something to tell your mother next time she calls.
Getting your nails done is one thing but going to dinner with a bunch of strangers and <u>him</u>... She didn't even look at him.
Got any more bread crust?
I mean, I've gone out with bums, but they were gorgeous. It's the only reason to go out with a bum.
This food's delicious. You're a wonderful cook. And you have a lovely home.

Why don't you go upstairs... take the day off. All right?...I'll cook tonight.
Well, it's funny! Whatta want from me?
It's not funny. It's... sophomoric and mindless... and dumb.
It's not funny. It's... sophomoric and mindless... and dumb.
Then why the hell do we watch all the time?
Then why the hell do we watch all the time?
Because it makes me feel good to see how not funny it is and how America doesn't know the first thing about funny which makes it easier not being a famous funny TV celebrity because that would just mean that I'm not really talented.
It happens to be a beautiful love story. Ya know, you used to like that about me. You used to say you liked that I didn't make you think so much. That we could be together and not think...
Yeah, well... suicidal paranoiacs say funny things sometimes.
I'm sorry.
I smell gas... Do you smell gas...
I can't tell you how distraught I was. All night long. What the hell happened?

And don't wanna have any now so I want ya to be up front
I'm not seeing anyone else. I really was attacked.
Okay. ... I love you...
Oh, I used to be such a Catholic.
You still believe in God?
You still believe in God?
Oh sure... Gotta believe in God. But I don't think God made man in his own image. No. 'Cause most of... the bullshit that happens, is because of men. No, I think man was made out of the devil's image and women were created out of God -- because women can have babies which is sorta like creating, and which also explains why women
... You have a little... uh... something on your face...
Oh, I got a pimple... This stuff is supposed to blend with my skin color... Like it really works, ya know...
I tell you something, Anne. I really feel like I'm cursed.
Oh stop. Things will change. My Aunt Mary always said, there's a remedy for everything in this world except death and having no class.
Oh stop. Things will change. My Aunt Mary always said, there's a remedy for everything in this world except death and having no class.
I get this feeling like I'm... a magnet but I attract shit. Out of all the people in this city, why did I meet a man who's wife I killed?

Well..everything's closed up. We thought we'd get some dinner. Say!....Anybody up for Chinese? Have you eaten? Would you like to come along?
What do you think?
I think they're made for each other. And it scares me.
You know, I can't believe I did it. You think it'll work out?
Who's knows. My Aunt Marge used to say, "some matches are made in heaven, some are made in hell and some are made in hardware stores".

Ya know, I'm thinkin' -- with another income coming in, I would love to get a bigger place.
Ugh, these tapes are a mess. I don't know where to begin...

You can't even give me that?! What were you gonna do, Jack?... Just gonna organize your life... ... walk out that door, move in by yourself and what -- drop the news when you find somebody else? What were you planning to do, Jack?
I didn't know. I just said all I want is some time.

I'm afraid not ... Then again, I'm not sure. The beating's bad but it's not the problem... It seems he's.. re-experiencing the catatonia... So, like before, he could snap out it in an hour or in thirteen months or thirteen years... ....I don't know. There's no way to tell.

Well, it's not unusual in his case... Sometimes victims of tragedies are subject to the brain's replay system. The brain never loses anything - it just stores it up and waits. A person could actually re-experience the full effect of a tragedy, long after the event took place. Are you relatives? Well, it doesn't matter. We'll take care of it. He'll have to be

You'd have the option to care for him at home but my advice is it wouldn't be the best thing for him. He needs hospital care. I just thought you could sign the release forms, but the city can do that. I wouldn't feel responsible in any way. There's really nothing you can do. I'm sorry.

Who?
Who?
Well, maybe he wants to stay here. Do...do you want to stay here?
It's such a great song.
It's a classic.
Don't you think it's time to go now? Running around here during the day is one thing but at night we could be killed by a wide variety of people.
Well that's stupid. This is my park just as much as it is theirs. You think it's fair they keep us out just because they make us think we'll get killed or something?
Well that's stupid. This is my park just as much as it is theirs. You think it's fair they keep us out just because they make us think we'll get killed or something?
Yes. I think that's very fair.
.....What are you doing?
Have you ever done any cloudbusting? You lie on your back and you concentrate on the clouds...and you try yo break them apart with your mind. It's wild.
You can't do this! This is New York! Nobody lies in naked in a field in New York..It's...it's too Midwestern.
Come on, try it. Ya feel the air on your body - ya little fella's flappin' in the breeze. ...everybody in the city is busy with their business and no one knows we're bare assed in the middle of it. Come on!

NO! I will not! This is nuts! I'm leaving! I mean it...this is nuts. This is too nuts...I'm leaving. I mean it!
..Ha...Little fella? I mean the man talks to invisible people - he sees invisible horses - and he's naked in the middle of Central Park. I should be surprised? I'm not surprised. I'm fucking outta my mind to even be here!
Who are you talking to Jack?
Who are you talking to Jack?
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND!!
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND!!
Bingo!
Are there any questions?
What?
What?
Then let's begin with the story itself. It's a story of the Grail myth...And although there are several variations, my favorite begins with the Fisher King as a young boy... who had to spend a night alone in the forest to prove his courage... and during that night, he is visited by a sacred vision. Out of the fire, appears the Holy Grail -
I can't ask for her...I have to earn her.
Parry, you don't have to <u>earn</u> a woman. It's the twentieth century.

Well, see, I think she can help...You know women are great..they...they make homes and they..ya know, kill the livestock so the knights can go out and get Grails and...and slaughter villages with a clear head...I mean, where would Arthur be without Guinevere...

Yeah.

It sounds exciting.

Why does it sound exciting? There's absolutely nothing exciting about it.
We mostly publish trashy romance novels.
Well - empires have fallen because of trashy romances...
How do you know him?
We were neighbors for a couple for weeks on Sutton Place.

And then we'll exchange phone numbers and you'll leave and never call and I'll go to work and feel great for the first hour and then slowly turn into a piece of dirt by lunch. Why am I putting myself through this? It was very nice... uh meeting you. Good night..
Excuse me...
Listen, I'm not feeling well.

Yeah, I told her it was you, but that you're wearing a wig, 'cause on TV you're mostly bald in the front.
Your little friend's real sharp there... Yeah, I don't like to wear the wig on TV, because with two and a half million people watching you, you've gotta be sincere. I just like to wear it when I'm out slippin' around bowling alleys an' things like that. I think it gives me a little more class, don't you?
We gotta get on home an' relieve the sitter. Why'nt you an' Ray come on over.
Okay. Go ahead. I'll settle up for the beers... An' walk Rayette over with you, will you.
Give 'em the horn, Bob.
Look at these assholes! What the hell are they doing?!
Well, id'n that nice.
It's ridiculous! I'm sitting here, listening to some asshole cracker compare his life to mine!
If you're sayin' you're somethin' better'n what I am, that's one thing. But I can't say much a someone who'd run off an' leave a woman in a situation like this an' feel easy about it. An' that's all I gotta say.
I hope that's all you gotta say, El, 'cause I'm about as tired of your mouth as I am workin' this stinkin' hole!
Tell me what in the hell's going on, Elton!
I got accused a robbin' a fillin'station down in the Indian Nation, didn' I tell you...
You're not going to play it again.
Well, lemme play the other side then.

Well, lemme sing the one I picked an' see what you think... "When there's a fire in your heart/Break the glass/Sound the alarm..."
How 'bout if I just cut off your damn water?
I'm too moved by your gentility to speak.
Sugar, you know how I feel about you, don't you? I'm just tryin' to get you to take an interest in my kind a things, an' what I'm tryin' to do with myself... You know, there id'n anything in the world I wouldn't do for you, baby. I started livin' the day I found you, you know that?
You're playing the other side.
Cerveza.
Serveza yourself!

I did, didn' I, El?
You got another ball comin'.
That was damn good, wad'n it? I finally did it...
Yeah, great. Why don't you throw Z's for 19 frames, and then roll a strike on the last ball in the last frame of a losing game? Just wonderful.
Come on. We're goin' over to Elton's.

Now, hand...
Elton and Stoney know how I feel about you. An' they're just goin' to think I'm not too nice a guy, which I'm not, an' that you're a hell of a person puttin' up with me, that's all.

You'll be gone, period.
You like it?

"You'll be burned out/Or smoked out/An' come back to me, I know..."
"Every trail that you blaze/Makes me..."
What the hell is that?
What?
I'll tell you... ... l-a-t-e-r.
Just one minute, you! Don't you ever talk to me like that!
Shut up! All of you!

Well, is that a happy face I see?
'Cause if it was me, I could just catch a Greyhound back.
Oh, you're not going to kill yourself this time. I wish I'd known...
Why can't I go out to your folks' house? Give me one good reason.
I have to see how things are first. My father's sick, you understand? They wouldn't be prepared for me bringing anyone.
So how long am I supposed to sit an' twiddle my thumbs in this place?
If you can't do what I ask, Ray, use that money to go back home, then.
If you can't do what I ask, Ray, use that money to go back home, then.

Just finish eating.
Just finish eating.
Oh, am I holdin' up dessert?
It's all right. He don't mean anything by that.

I'm gonna go in that cafe an' get some coffee. You want anything?
No.
No.
You got any change?
Sure you don't want anything?
Fill it up.
Look at my car! Piece of shit! I just bought it brand new from a used-car lot, and the steering goes to the pot on me!
You're lucky no one was hurt.
You're lucky no one was hurt.

You don't have to tell everybody about it. Pretty soon they'll all go there and it won't be so clean.
How do you know it's clean?

I saw a picture of it. Alaska is very clean. It appeared to look very white to me... Don't you think?
I saw a picture of it. Alaska is very clean. It appeared to look very white to me... Don't you think?
Yeah. That's before the big thaw.
I had to leave this place. I got depressed, seeing all the crap. And the thing is, they're making more crap, you know? They've got so many stores and stuff and junk full of crap, I can't believe it.
Who?
Who?
Who? People, that's who! Pretty soon there won't be room for anyone. They're selling more crap that people go and buy than you can imagine. Oofh! Crap! I believe everybody should have a big hole where they throw in all this stuff and burn it.
Well...
It's just filthy. People are dirty. I think that's the biggest thing that's wrong with people. I think they wouldn't be as violent if they were clean, because then they wouldn't have anybody to pick on... Oofh... Dirt...
Hey, mack!
Shut up. You have bread, don't you, and a toaster of some kind?
Fantastic! That you could figure all that out, and lay that down on her, to come up with a way you could get your toast.
I didn't get it, did I?
I didn't get it, did I?
No, but it was very clever... I would of just punched her out.
Can I get you anything else?
No. How much do I owe you?

I know what it comes with, but that's not what I want.
I'll come back when you've made up your mind...
Wait, I've made up my mind. I want a plain omelette, forget the tomatoes, don't put potatoes on the plate, and give me a side of wheat toast and a cup of coffee.
I'm sorry, we don't have side orders of toast. I can give you an English muffin or a coffee roll.

Would you like to talk to the manager?

Carl's a fiddler. What's he doing coaching piano?
Well, 11 months ago he was on his bicycle, on his way to the post office in La Roche... and he ran into a Jeep and sprained his neck...
It's not funny. He permanently sprained his neck, and since then it's been extremely difficult for him to tuck the violin.
Crashes into a Jeep and totals his neck. That's Carl...

Don't tell me about this...
Yeah... I guess so...
I'm going back up tonight. Will you go with me?
I'm going back up tonight. Will you go with me?

I'd rather drive up myself and... maybe go into Canada after... And I can't stay long, Tita, probably a week, at the most.

Wait...
Maybe you better stay, then.
No, I need to talk to you, about so many things...

Tita, I've got to go...
Tita, I've got to go...
All right...
Well, I really appreciate it, Carl.
I don't think you should infer Daddy was wrong in front of him...
How long have you been staying here?
A couple of months.
He has ways of communicating, Robert. I can tell when he's expressing approval or disapproval, just from his eyes...
Uhm hmm. Some range.
Uhm hmm. Some range.
It's not that bad.
It's not that bad.
Yes, it is. I can't take seeing him, sitting there like a stone.
Yes, it is. I can't take seeing him, sitting there like a stone.
A week or two isn't going to ruin your life, for Godsakes.
I mean, you think I'm that happy?
No, I don't. You should've left a long time ago.
No, I don't. You should've left a long time ago.
We can't all get up and leave, can we? I mean, there are certain needs you have to respond to...
What questions?
Well, do you -- I mean, have you enjoyed all these... strange things you've been doing?
Well, do you -- I mean, have you enjoyed all these... strange things you've been doing?
Sometimes.
Why? Am I some kind of freak to you or something?
No, no, I don't think that, I'm just curious about it... Do you think I'm a freak?
No, no, I don't think that, I'm just curious about it... Do you think I'm a freak?
Sort of.
Oh no... Why? What is it? The way I look?
No, I don't really think you're a freak.
No, I don't really think you're a freak.
I probably am, but I don't care. I mean, I wasn't that blessed to begin with, and when would I have had time to make any improvements...

What about Carl and Catherine? Is he just coaching her, or what?

Constantly. Night and day. And unless I get up before the birds, I can't get in any practice time for myself...
Constantly. Night and day. And unless I get up before the birds, I can't get in any practice time for myself...
Uhm hmm.
Uhm hmm.
Actually, it's very admirable, the way she works. She'll probably be enormously successful, because she's attractive as well, not that that's so important in music, but...

You're attractive, Tita. If you just did a little more with yourself...

Like what?
Like what?
Well, if you just maybe did something with your hair, or...
Well, if you just maybe did something with your hair, or...
Oh, let's not talk about my hair, it does what it wants to, and anyway, who cares, I want to talk about you...
Oh, let's not talk about my hair, it does what it wants to, and anyway, who cares, I want to talk about you...
There's nothing to say, Tita...
Well, you're not going to run out on me right away, are you?
I don't know.
Do you want some gingerbread?
What?
What?
With applesauce?
With applesauce?
No, thanks...
Look at that.
Why are you being so mean?
Why are you being so mean?
I'm not. He does walk funny. Don't you see that?
I don't think I'd notice. I'm so used to Carl.
Yeah, well, he's...
I think he's got a terrific personality.
You know, he was formerly a sailor.
Look, can't you see that, what I'm talking about?
Sailors are sadistic, I feel.
Where is she, anyway?
My turn.
It's none of your business!
Where's Catherine?!
Where's Catherine?!
I don't know where she is!
I'm talking to you, Tita!
Can't I have anything to myself, dammit?!
You're leaving?
Yeah. I said a week, and I've overstayed myself...
Yeah. I said a week, and I've overstayed myself...
You were going without saying goodbye?
You were going without saying goodbye?
I didn't want to say goodbye to anyone.
I didn't want to say goodbye to anyone.
But what about me?
But what about me?
I'll say goodbye to you, Tita.
Bye, now.
Bye, Robert.
What have you been doing since then?
What have I been doing? Different things, different jobs, here and there. Nothing that interesting.
What have I been doing? Different things, different jobs, here and there. Nothing that interesting.
And you no longer play at all?
Hello...
I guess you fell in the water.
I guess you fell in the water.
Yes, intentionally.
Yes, intentionally.
That's dangerous, you know.
That's dangerous, you know.
Swimming?
Swimming?
Playing piano all day and then jumping into cold water. You could get a cramp.
I love to swim, and I don't mind the cold at all. It's invigorating.
Well, I wouldn't want to get too invigorated myself.
Well, I wouldn't want to get too invigorated myself.
Why?
Why?
What would I do with it? Run amok?
Besides piano and swimming, what else do you do?
Well, there's fishing and boating. There's concerts on the mainland and... but I feel silly telling you. This is really your home. You probably know better than I what there is to do.
Well, there's fishing and boating. There's concerts on the mainland and... but I feel silly telling you. This is really your home. You probably know better than I what there is to do.
Nothing.
Nothing.
Nothing? Then it must be very boring for you here.
Nothing? Then it must be very boring for you here.
That's right. Have you anything to suggest?
That's right. Have you anything to suggest?
I don't know. Let me give it some thought.
Right now I'm going to run a hot tub and soak myself.
Then after that?
After that, I plan to read some music and rest for awhile.
Tomorrow, then.
Tomorrow, then.
Tomorrow's a full practice day... But the day after is kind of open.
Carl has hydrotherapy on Tuesdays.
The day after tomorrow.
The day after tomorrow.
If you're free.
If you're free.
Yeah, I'll probably be free.
One thing that's hard to understand is how you could have this incredible background in music, and then just walk away from it, without a second thought...
I gave it a second thought.
I mean, how could you not play anymore? That's so strange to me...
I have played a few times. Here and there. As a matter of fact, I was once a rehearsal pianist for a Las Vegas musical revue.

You don't call that music, though.
You don't call that music, though.
Of course I do. It's music. You know...
That was beautiful, Robert. I'm surprised...
Thank you.
Thank you.
I was really very moved by the way you...
Is that funny?
It wasn't supposed to be, it just struck me that way.
It wasn't supposed to be, it just struck me that way.
Why?
Why?
Nothing. It's just that... I picked the easiest piece I could remember. I think I first played it when I was 8 years old and I played it better then.
Nothing. It's just that... I picked the easiest piece I could remember. I think I first played it when I was 8 years old and I played it better then.
It doesn't matter. It was the feeling I was affected by.
It doesn't matter. It was the feeling I was affected by.
I didn't have any.
I didn't have any.
You had no inner feeling?
You had no inner feeling?
None.
None.
Then I must have been supplying it.
Wait...
Well, at least you're accomplished at something...
Well, at least you're accomplished at something...
What?
What?
At being a fake.
Catherine...
No, you're very good at it. I'm really impressed.
You think I'm a fake.
I think it's what you think.
I think it's what you think.
No, it isn't what I think.
No, it isn't what I think.
Look... You made a very calculated move, and then made me feel embarrassed for responding to you. That wasn't necessary.
Yes, it was. You've made it clear that if I can cut a little piano, I might get a little response.
I don't think that's accurate...
I don't think that's accurate...
Up to now, what I've been getting from you are meaningful looks over the dinner table and a lot of vague suggestions about the day after tomorrow...
Up to now, what I've been getting from you are meaningful looks over the dinner table and a lot of vague suggestions about the day after tomorrow...
I'm not conscious of having given you any meaningful looks. And as for the day after tomorrow, this is the day after tomorrow, and I am, unfortunately, seeing you... Now if you'll excuse me, I'd like to take a bath.
It's convenient to fake looking for something right now, isn't it?
I'm not faking anything. I'm looking for some bath oil...
I'm not faking anything. I'm looking for some bath oil...
Some bath oil?
I don't find your language that charming.
It's direct, anyway, which seems to be difficult for you.
It's direct, anyway, which seems to be difficult for you.
I'd like you to leave now. Is that direct enough?
Serious, that's what's important to you?
Yes, that's what's important to me...
No, don't do that...
Shut up...
No inner feeling.
That's right.
That's right.
I don't believe vou.
I married him when I was 17. He was a cellist, and I thought he was the most brilliant man I'd ever met... And I'm sure he was, because at that age, I hadn't met that many... But he was insidious, you know. He had me convinced that I was a mediocrity, musically, as a woman, as an intellect. But in this completely imperceptible,
That's what you said?
That's what you said?
Something witty and devastating like that.
As a matter of fact, he's the one who introduced me to Carl... How are you?
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
Carl restored my confidence. He really did. He's much more substantial than you give him credit for.
Carl restored my confidence. He really did. He's much more substantial than you give him credit for.
Is he?
Is he?
Yes.
Do you think you could discreetly move across the hall now?
Yeah, I think I could.
Robert?
What?
What?
I could spend some time with you tomorrow morning, before Carl comes back, I mean, if you'd like to.
I could spend some time with you tomorrow morning, before Carl comes back, I mean, if you'd like to.
Of course I'd like to.
Where are you going?
I'm going to pick up some friends of Carl's. Are you all right?
I'm going to pick up some friends of Carl's. Are you all right?
I have to talk to you.
I have to talk to you.
I'll be back later...
No, I want to talk to you now. I have to explain something about...
No, you don't have to, it isn't necessary...
No, you don't have to, it isn't necessary...
Yes, it is!
No, I can't...
Will you let me talk to you, please?
Will you let me talk to you, please?
I can't do that. I haven't been being fair to Carl. I have to tell you that.
I can't do that. I haven't been being fair to Carl. I have to tell you that.
Oh. You have to tell me that.
Oh. You have to tell me that.
What?! I can't hear you!
I'm sorry everything's been so confusing, but I have to go, Robert...
Catherine...
Catherine...
Please, I'll see you later this evening.
No. It's useless, Robert. It wouldn't work, not ever...
Just give me a chance, will you?
Just give me a chance, will you?
I'm trying to be delicate with you, but you're not understanding me. It's not just because of Carl, or my music, but because of you... I mean, what would it come to? If a person has no love for himself, no respect, no love for his work, his family, his friends, something... How can he ask for love in return? I mean, why should
And living out here, in this rest home asylum, that's what you want?
Yes.
Yes.
That'll make you happy.
That'll make you happy.
I hope it will, yes. I'm sorry.
Four or five years.
No, the last time was three years ago.
Did you hear about my misfortune, Robert?
What?
What?
It's still nearly impossible for me to turn my neck. If I wanted to turn toward Catherine, for instance, I'd first have to twist the whole base of my body around... ... like this...
She's tremendously gifted, this girl.
Is she?
I hope you feel at home, Robert. I'm really glad you're here.
Thanks, Carl...
Robert, do you mind?
What?
What?
Nothing. Will you excuse us for a while?
You sure you should be playing, Carl?
What do you mean? Aside from my neck, I'm in superb shape.
I'm not aware of it. Like what?
Your serve. Two -- Eighteen.
I've walked across a stage a number of times, without exciting any particular response...
That's what I mean...
See? There's nothing wrong with the way I walk. Now where are we?
At game, Carl.
That's three games to none, Carl.
All right, let's have a rematch.
All right, let's have a rematch.
I thought you had to go to the mainland today. Aren't you going to miss the ferry?
Oh, for chrissakes...
Robert, let's not be rude, okay?
Robert, I think you better just...
You're all full of shit!
Come on, get moving, dammit!!
Will you shut up for a minute!! Pull your car out of line.
Haven't you got a jacket or anything with you?
No, I don't, I uh... it got burned up. Everything in the car got the shit burned out of it. All I got left is what I have on...
No, I don't, I uh... it got burned up. Everything in the car got the shit burned out of it. All I got left is what I have on...
I've got an extra jacket behind the seat, if you want to put it on.
I've got an extra jacket behind the seat, if you want to put it on.
No, it's okay.
No, it's okay.
Suit yourself. But I'll tell you, where we're headed is gonna get colder'n hell.
Suit yourself. But I'll tell you, where we're headed is gonna get colder'n hell.
It's all right. I'm fine.
You've been staying in a motel all this time?
For two whole weeks, an' there wasn't hardly nobody there to talk to but me. The manager of the place told me it was the off season, an' it must a ben, because other'n me, there was just this 25-year-old kid, DeLyon, that didn't appear to be all there, an' this old married pair next to me that was always hollerin' for quiet.

I don't understand why you had to stay in a motel. There's more than enough room here.
I don't understand why you had to stay in a motel. There's more than enough room here.
Well, I was goin' to, but Bobby said he hadda kind of feel things up here first, which I can understand, but then it went an' took so long, I ran flat outa money... I didn't have no number to call, you know. So I hadda clear outa there an' come on up here, in the hopes that I wouldn't be intrudin' myself...

Oh, no. You're more than welcome.
Oh, no. You're more than welcome.
Well, thank you, that's a very nice thing for you to say.
Well, thank you, that's a very nice thing for you to say.
Not at all.
No, you're not. Go ahead and take your time.
I do eat slow as a bird, whereas Bobby can put it away like a speed swing... Is there any ketchup around?
What kind of doggy is that?
It's a Borzoi.
It's a Borzoi.
Oh, uh huh. I had a little kittycat once, that Bobby give me...
Oh no, it's been much more than that.
Away from the piano, Tita, you have no sense of time at all.
Away from the piano, Tita, you have no sense of time at all.
I don't think that's true.
I don't think that's true.
It is true.
It is true.
Besides being very rude.
You know, just after I came back off tour with the Betenthaller Quartet, Dad, myself and Herbert had a summit conference about you...
Oh, my, "a summit conference." I wonder where I was, polishing silver behind the coal bin.
Oh, my, "a summit conference." I wonder where I was, polishing silver behind the coal bin.
I don't know where you were, penis envy.
I don't know where you were, penis envy.
I hope I didn't hear that.
I hope I didn't hear that.
At any rate, Dad wanted to hire a private detective to ferret you out, and I said, "What for?" Whatever the hell he's doing, even if it's a completely wasteful escapade, it's entirely his business. Simple as that...
What's wrong, Carl, you hardly ate anything...
I took some aspirin and it really upset my stomach.
And what about love?
What about it? Wouldn't you agree that a great deal of mischief has been done in the name of love?
What about it? Wouldn't you agree that a great deal of mischief has been done in the name of love?
No, I wouldn't.
No, I wouldn't.
Well, you're a romantic, Catherine, as are most musicians, and what's more, about to be married...
... which should exclude you from any objective discussion. But keep in mind, even the arts aren't free of aggressive content, nor the institution of marriage.
I think these cold, "objective" discussions are aggressive, Samia...
But I'd like to say, so that I don't dampen the spirit of your adventure...
You haven't dampened my spirit, Samia... Excuse me.
You haven't dampened my spirit, Samia... Excuse me.
Well, I should hope not...
Come on, Terry, we got a ride!
Jesus, what a rude person...
There'd never be a hole big enough. Now took at me, for instance, when I was just one person, before Bobby, I had so much garbage collectin' onto me every day, I was thinkin' about gettin a dispose all...
A dispose-all, what's that but more crap? I've never seen such crap. Oofh, I don't know how people get up in the morning.
Well...
Not dirt. See, dirt isn't bad. It's filth. Filth is bad. That's what starts maggots and riots...
Hey, follow that truck. They know the best places to stop.
That's an old maid's tale.
That's an old maid's tale.
Bullshit! Truck drivers know the best eating places on the road.
Salesmen and cops are the ones. If you'd ever waitressed, honey, you'd know.
Don't call me "honey," mack.
Don't call me "honey," mack.
Don't call me "mack," honey.
Don't call me "mack," honey.
I wouldn't be a waitress. They're nasty and full of crap.

In my personal observation, I think that more people are neat than are clean...

In my personal thing, I don't see that. I'm seeing more filth. A lot of filth. What they need to do every day, no, once in a while, is a cockroach thing, where they spray the homes. And uh... can you imagine, if their doors were painted a pretty color, and they had a pot outside, with...

Yeah, it could be adorable...
Yeah, it could be adorable...
And they picked up! I mean, it wouldn't be filthy, with Coke bottles and whiskey, and those signs everywhere...
And you know, I read where they invented this car that runs on... that runs on... when you boil water...
Steam.
Steam.
Right, steam. A car you could ride around in and not cause a stink. But do you know, they will not even let us have it. Can you believe it? Why?! Man! He likes to create a stink. I wrote them a note once, and told them to clean it... I mean, don't you see that? It's just filthy! I mean, I've seen filth
John believes in the basic goodness of man, and that's fine, but gaze into the pit like I have and that view seems a little soporific. And not unlike television, it hardly represents the real world...
There's some good things on it, though.

Pardon me?

The choice of words, "squashed flat," juxtaposed against the image of a fluffy kitten...
Well, she was.
Well, she was.
Perhaps...
Miss Dupea.
Yes.
I'd like to remind you again, this isn't an opera or a musical comedy.
Oh... I'm sorry. Was I singing again?
Oh... I'm sorry. Was I singing again?
If you want to call it that.
If you want to call it that.
Well, you have to simply tell me, that's all.

First of all, let me just reiterate that this is not a formal investigation. I'm not going through formal channels here, because if Alan Stanwyk is not involved in any improprieties, then nobody has to know I was even --
Alan Stanwyk is not involved in improprieties. Where the hell does the S.E.C. come off --
Look. You know that and I know that, but somebody's bucking for a promotion. I think it's that bozo, Hanrahan, I can't be sure. Anyway, unless I go back there with something, you and your son-in-law are next week's scapegoats.
Unbelievable.

Utah? Jesus Christ! First of all, Alan Stanwyk does not own one share of stock.The three million dollars for the ranch in Provo comes from my daughter who converted some of her personal holdings, not company holdings. Now if anybody in DC wants to make something of that, bring 'em on. Until then, get the hell out of my face.

You go back to that goddamn beach, I swear to God I'll make you regret it.

Can I call my Mom? I'd like to tell here how much I've always loved her.
What'll it be Fletch?
I hate the beach. Wouldn't go there if you paid me. Besides, I'm way overdue on my story about off-track betting in the Himalayas. You don't think it's the mafia, do you?
Its been very nice meeting you. I enjoy your column.
Speaking of which, you're not going to print anything before my investigation is through, are you?
Not a prayer.
Not a prayer.

Thanks for coming down to see us.

Greetings, everyone.
Thank God, the police.
This one's going to be even more fun.
Go ahead. Make my evening.
What the hell are you doing here?
Put the gun down, Alan. I'll take care of them.
I've got it all under control, Jerry. You can go now.
Under control? You idiot. You didn't know who he was?
Fat Sam left the beach today. So did Gummy. It began to occur to me that some things are beginning to happen that maybe I should be aware of.
I said I'll take care of it. Now, a man of your position shouldn't be a part of what's about to go down. So go home and I'll call you tomorrow.

What, 'long distance?' I couldn't help but hear you say something about Rio, Alan. You're not leaving with the eight hundred thousand dollars I staked you for the next load, are you?
Jerry, you're simply going to have to trust me. I've got a foolproof way to get rid of this guy and now you're jeopardizing everything.
Your 'foolproof' way is going to land my ass on the front page while you're basking in Rio.
So where do you know Alan from?

Ahem. 'Sally Ann can confirm all this when the police pick her up at the Airport Marriott.'
Bravo, Mr. Fletcher.
The thing that really tipped it off for me was something your wife said to me while we were in bed together.
And what was that?
How similar in build you and I are. Then I figured it. You bump me off, throw me in the car, and burn me up.
I was already prepared to commit one murder. What makes you think I won't commit two?

Where are you going?

What are you doing here?
I couldn't sit home and play the mournful widow anymore, and the police didn't need me, so I tried watching a Lakers game on TV, but the announcer talked to fast and I couldn't understand a lot of what was happening, so I figured if I came down here maybe you could explain the rules to me, and besides, I missed you.
No problem.

I really don't want to spoil your surprise, Frank. Why don't you read it tomorrow?
Just give me a hint, all right?
All right. Maybe there are some crooked cops involved in all this.
More cops. I think I gotta go to Utah, Frank.
Utah?
Utah?
Yeah. It's wedged in between Wyoming and Nevada. I'm sure you've seen pictures.

It's called journalism, Fletch. It's called getting both sides of the story. Something you apparently don't know anything about.

Their statements, naming Chief Cummings as the numero uno drug pusher from here to Oxnard. I want them to have federal protection under the paper's sponsorship.

Mrs. Stanwyk, I hate to disturb you. Tom Underhill here... I'm a new member.
Apparently, someone of your acquaintance has charged the most extraordinary lunch to my bill.
John!
You don't know the Underhills?
I'd appreciate an opportunity to discuss this with you.

Ford Fairlane, I'm Colleen Sutton and I need your help. I have a problem and it pertains to the music industry. What is it they call you? Mr. Rock and...
Don't say it. Orange juice?
Don't say it. Orange juice?
Please.
Sorry about the glass. And the house. And the breath.
Mr. Fairlane, I'm very rich. The kind of rich that warps minds. Nothing offends me. When I was eleven, I walked in on my father and the Shetland pony he had given me for my tenth birthday. Does that excite you?

Oh, that! Don't take it personally. He always wakes up before I do. Down boy! Roseanne Barr naked!

But how did you know? Here, take this picture...
No thanks. I carry my own.
Excuse me?
Excuse me?
Let's see, you're her worried sister. Yesterday I met her worried father who incidentally was about five years younger than you. In fact, I capped off the evening by watching him get electrocuted. They talk about cases like this in the private eye handbook... something about a ten-foot pole.
Five thousand should be enough to assuage any qualms you have about my family tree.
Yeah, but of course for now, I only get a twenty.

I have no answers. Thanks for the stain. Find the girl. In the envelope are tickets to the Dorothy Chandler. We'll chat again, then.
Ah, the Dorothy Chandler. I was just there with my good friend Art Mooney the other night...
Who?
Who?
Nuthin'.
My God, Mr. Fairlane, you look like the Fall of Saigon.

Colleen and Johnny, sitting in a tree, k-i-s-s-i-n-g...
Uh, let's go sit down.
So you know about Johnny Crunch and myself.
I'm sorry, that's gotta be a pair of tube socks he has down there.
Ouch... Of course I want off the case. Some monster from Woodstock tried and succeeded in killing me tonight. The fact I'm alive's a technicality.
So you...
So you...
Listen, Queen Collie, I have a code. I never, ever, drop a case. Besides, I, uh, used all your money to pay my bills, so I kinda owe you.

Question one: Can I have some money? Kidding. Why didn't you tell me about you and Johnny? You two were into something even more dangerous than sex, weren't you? Who? What? Where? How? Now.
Jonathan was such a beautiful man. No one knew him like I did... Excuse me. I can't do this now. I'll call you tomorrow.
Thanks for the information. Appreciate it.
I ask you to find a girl and instead you steal a C.D. from me. Ford. You suck.
I'll buy you a new one. I found her.

Damnit... you were right last night. Jonathan and I were into more than sex. Along with Bobby Vomit, right after old Jack Grendel died, we took part in a scheme to rip off Grendel records... I didn't want you involved...
But I am...
What cheap shit... hey, waiter!
We invested in these factories. In Vancouver.

Damn, Ford, you're the most cynical man in the industry and that's not easy.
I'm not cynical. Can I help it that life is a disease and everyone's a victim. So you're producing exclusively for Grendel Records now. Hope you're taking Julian for a bundle.

Man, ever since old Jack Grendel died, Julian has got me into one yummy gig after the other. Not only am I producing, he's got me in some lovely-bullshit-money-money executive position. What are you looking at...
You gotta shave before you leave the house in a dress like that and I don't mean your legs. Why didn't you jump on her? What's happening to you?
I guess I'm not interested in any club who'll have my member as a member. Later, Don...
I haven't seen her around, and as for who would want to kill Johnny Crunch, line forms to the left. You'd find less people on our planet who wanted him alive.
Great pipes.
I've heard cars fuck with more harmony.
Tell me about it. Name's Kyle Troy. Can't we bring up the bass.
Julian's happy as long as he doesn't see glass shatter.
I never thought I'd be jealous of your handicap... Sorry to hear about Bobby Vomit.
Have a copy of that sent to me, will ya?
Right away!
Hey, Don, how's the high blood pressure.
Could somebody tell me what's going on? <u>Like slo-owly</u>...
Thanks for the promotion, man.
No prob...

You're friends with the most obnoxious asshole on the airwaves. The King of the Shock Jocks. I'm, I'm shocked.
I love you, too, baby. He wants to meet at six. What time is it now?
That's for me... Radio contests, really Ford, how tacky...
Ah -- ha... You know, you should think about dating Earthmen again.
So what about this watch?
Keep it. It's your paycheck this month.
Quiet. Tell me you tapped in the police computer and found out lots of good stuff about Art Mooney...
I found a lot of Art Mooneys. None with a police record, though. Not even Synchronicity. Have you checked out Johnny Pinzolo/Crunch's houseboat yet?
Tonight after I see Don. Some Beverly Hillbilly just hired me to find you-know-fucking-who. Name's Colleen Sutton.
Spooky. I'll process her.
Spooky. I'll process her.
Cool. Jazz, meet me at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion tonight. I'll have a ticket for you at the door. Some concert. Could be interesting. Dress nice.
Sorry, Jazz. After this, I'll throw a burger down your throat, okay?
You're a fucking gentleman. What do you want from me?
You're a fucking gentleman. What do you want from me?
This Colleen Sutton woman I'm with. If she flees me to go powder her whatever, I need you to keep tabs...
You going to be okay?
Go on, 'they're stahting.'
And it's good to see you, Julian. This is my assistant, Jazz.
Mmmmmmm. Mmmm, mmm.
Why did you interrupt? Maxwell seemed like he wanted to hire me.
Shut up, goodies from the ice queen.
How'd you get this from her?
You don't want to know, believe me. But don't worry, I washed my hands...
You don't want to know, believe me. But don't worry, I washed my hands...
A fucking C.D. Wow, this case is closed. So, she's got bad taste in music and in men... Did I tell you she and Johnny were lovers and that they were into something and he got killed for it?
A fucking C.D. Wow, this case is closed. So, she's got bad taste in music and in men... Did I tell you she and Johnny were lovers and that they were into something and he got killed for it?

What did you... Hey, where's your spex?
Contacts.
Contacts.
I like.
I don't know, what was the case?
Ms. Sutton hired you to find the girl. Period.

Then I guess her case is closed. Mine isn't. I want to know why everybody wants Zuzu. Why people are killing and dying for her.
She's just a bundle of energy, a real treasure...
Yeah, let's bury her.
Yeah, let's bury her.
Hello... It's Colleen. With answers. She wants to meet. Down. Way down-town. Late.
You okay?
Lieutenant Anus has discovered the cold-blooded killer behind everything.
Lieutenant Anus has discovered the cold-blooded killer behind everything.
Who?
Ah, an obvious choice.
Let's get her out of here, before she starts a shoot-out. Drop us at my place.
Hello, Ford...
What are you doing at the office? You wouldn't believe what I've gone through tonight... I'm calling from the Mega Beta Pogo Sorority.
I came to warn you...
Oh, Jazz, those bastards... call an ambulance! Get that music off!
I believe the last time we came across one of these, was at the ballet. What were your words... 'A fucking C.D. This case is closed.'
I've always said the one reason I'm the best detective in the industry is that I'm the only one... but hey, I never throw away a clue...
Aha, just what I suspected!
You're not funny.
Hmmm, the first disc was putting out an incomprehensible stream of high bits. This one is putting out low bits. The data is in some fucked binary system. The two discs need to interface simultaneously with a third decryptor disc. Comprendo?
Su-ure. Two people hired me to find Zuzu in order to get hold of one of those discs and Colleen threw a tizz when we took hers. Obviously, all this binary disc shit is pretty mighty. But it's not necessary. People are dead. One was a friend. The same people were involved in a scam to rip off Grendel Records. Bottom line's Julian Grendel
Your timing swallows the massive one. Grendel just tried to kill us, he's about to frame and kiss Don, and we can't do shit. Don't even ask about those discs. Goddamn that Art Mooney with a star by his name! It's tied to Johnny's C.D., I know.
Johnny's C.D.?
What an interface!
Seems to be information about a factory in Vancouver.

Yeah, Colleen mentioned it. What do they make?

C.D.s. The music kind. From the Grendel label.
C.D.s. The music kind. From the Grendel label.
Without Grendel knowing about it. B-I-N-G-O and Bingo was his name-O. Counterfeit C.D.s. Tape piracy has graduated to disc piracy, the sound quality's better, and so's the money.

But the funny thing is, take a look at these Swiss bank account numbers. We got Bobby, Johnny, Colleen... and Julian Grendel.
After their initial investment in the factory, Grendel didn't need them. Told them to fuck off. They tried to get these C.D.s together in order to have proof of Grendel's involvement, so they could keep him in line. Now's the fun part...
I can't believe I lost an eye for a bunch of phony C.D.s
I just can't deal with all this crap between us, I'm sorry. I'm quitting.
Let's get hitched. I guess I, you know, love you. It's a beautiful thing.

Zuzu Petals! Zuzu Petals! Yes! Who killed Bobby Vomit? Who killed Johnny Crunch? Why do people want you so goddamn bad?
I don't know. I'm so scared. Help me.
A simple 'please' would suffice...
Fluck you!
It's red, Ford.
What?
Hello?
Give me your gum and grab the wheel.
You okay?
Peachy.
Let's get serious...
Why are all these people after me?
Why are all these people after me?
Uh... wha? You're supposed to answer those questions, not ask 'em. I take it a woman named Colleen Sutton is not your big sister and that the late D.J. Johnny Crunch ain't your daddy?
Uh... wha? You're supposed to answer those questions, not ask 'em. I take it a woman named Colleen Sutton is not your big sister and that the late D.J. Johnny Crunch ain't your daddy?
I'm so sure! I'm an only child and my parents are Bill and Shirley Petals of South Bend, Indiana. They run a hardware store and...
You hung out with Bobby Vomit. Who would want him dead?
I dunno. He was to sound what Cezanne was to image or at least I thought so. Ever since he died, I've been chased... <u>Omigod</u>!

Zuzu Petals, you're not bad. In fact, I was discussing this whole rock-n-roll thing with my pal Art Mooney the other day. You know him?
No. Who's Art Mooney?
No. Who's Art Mooney?
He's the lamest clue I've ever had in my life. Here's our stop...
Yeah, it's weird. Bobby and Johnny were such good friends...
Friends? You didn't tell me that.
Friends? You didn't tell me that.
You didn't ask. Have you ever thought about mousse?
Why are you depressed? You get in all the clubs, you never pay cover...

Are you okay?
Are you okay?
Okay? I just blew up. I feel orgasmic.
My axe!
Ford, do you got something cooking in the microwave?
I know the feeling. This must be hell. Can you believe, a flucking sorority... I'm gonna vomit Day-Glo.
Ye-ah. Sure.
This is boring, guys.
Zuzu, be quiet. Put in Colleen's disc. Number two.
Ford, you were right!
Ye-ah.
I'm afraid so, you want her?
But you know, that was just a dream. Doesn't really count.
Nice left you got there, jerk.
Sorry, it was dark, now come on.
This way...
No, wait...
Suck a dick, I left my purse...

Ick.
I won't ask why you would want to help someone trying to kill you, but hey, good job. Shall we?
Hey. God. You're an asshole.
Let go of the belt! What are you doing? You got mad at me for trying to save the other guy.
I can't kill this kid's father...
Who do you think you are, Ford? The tooth fairy. Kill! Kill! Kill!
Who do you think you are, Ford? The tooth fairy. Kill! Kill! Kill!
This is fucking unbelievable. Zuzu, it's a long story, you see...
Hello, Mr. Tongue! What a perv.
You wish. Come on, let's get outta here.
Are you okay?
There's that question...
Oh how sweet, your friend's got his own star.

I'll mail you a letter, come on!
Hoh graphic! I'm going to dream of ears for a year! Ugh!
Just be thankful he wasn't dissatisfied with his sex life.
So, Zuzu. Are you okay?
Yeah, Ford. I'm okay.
Fairlane, you gonna find out who killed the lead singer of Black Vomit?
Tell me, Dr. Watson, what makes you think he's not just another piece of shit overdose.
Gut feeling.
I'll give you a gut feeling, you little... Hey... <u>hey</u>! Get that stick out of your mouth. These things are killers, man. Don't you go to school, listen to Smokey the Bear and all that...
When you going to let me work with you? Why you always fucking with me?
Why am I what? Excuse me? I catch you saying the F-word again. I'll kill you. That's a fucking promise. Now get the fuck out of here.
I got something serious to dis-cuss.
Well what is it? I'm not Kreskin.
Well what is it? I'm not Kreskin.

Did he just say what I think he said?

I've got a clue. Look at my ring. Before my old lady ran off to Baja, she told me my dad had this same ring.
Holy Colonel Mustard. Gosh, you didn't mention the big clue... Kid, I can't take your money.
You need it.

He, he, lives in South America... he's doing that anthropologist- archeologist-dentist kind of thing ... he's real busy.
I need someone to help me with my case load, you interested? This whole father/son thing, if you're not into it, I mean, it's okay. You know what I'm saying?
Shut the heck up... Pop.
Nice tie, Lt. Anus, sir.
You think you're so hot just because you can get into any club. You think you're so hot, just because you have sex with great- looking women. You think you're so hot just because you broke the Ensenada tape piracy ring...

Have a problem, call Ford Fairlane. He won't solve your case, but who cares, you'll be dead in a couple days anyway. Let's face it. After today, the California Raisins aren't gonna hire you.
That's okay. I'm quitting the music detective business to become a cop killer. Pay's the same, but it'll be much more fun.

Really?
It's some psycho killer groupie. I got an anonymous letter that says she killed Bobby Vomit, Johnny Crunch, and now, this society dame.
Once I got an anonymous letter saying that the world would be destroyed by a giant purple raindrop. I didn't even buy a fucking umbrella... You were in too many discos during the seventies. The Village People rotted your brain.

Whatever you're getting paid, I can give you twenty, maybe thirty bucks more.
Feel my thumb? I keep it there forty seconds more and a welt develops cutting off the oxygen to your brain. I leave. Twenty- one minutes later, you're dead. The slowest, most painful minutes a person can experience.

You gotta be kidding! This is unfuckingbelievable! I have to start the evening crawling down Capital Records, I shoulda chose suicide then, but oh no, the night was young! Next up, my guitar!

How could Grendel Records sign such a wick-prick? I guess Julian Grendel really is deaf as a fucking doorknob. I hear Ray Charles is going to head up the video division.
Actually that's rather an intriguing idea...
Good to meet you, Mr. Fairlane. Your mouth makes quite a reflection. I'm Julian Grendel.
Boing. You're one hell of a lip reader.
Boing. You're one hell of a lip reader.
Why thank you. It's a Christmas present. That was my sense of humor, everyone. I wish you would fake a laugh. It's easy with a deaf person.
I knew your father. He was quite...
An asshole? A swine? A ballistic turd? Pick one. I never knew what a blessing my accident was until he died and I had to take over the company. You see the music is irrelevant in this industry. I'm going to have to ship this 'wick-prick' platinum just so teenage girls can have a compact disc cover to get wet with.
Terrible thing, but good career move. His record sales have gone way up. I'll just have to create a new Black Vomit.
I was just discussing this whole Vomit thing with my friend Art Mooney. Do you know him?
Well, hello, Ford.
Mmmmmmm. Mmmm, mmm.
Mmmmmmm. Mmmm, mmm.
I must say you're an island of reality in an ocean of diarrhea.
So what did you think of the ballet? Was it like a warm Ice Capades?
Yeah, I did, you condescending fuck, but I miss Snoopy coming out at the end. Isn't your enjoyment impaired?
Yeah, I did, you condescending fuck, but I miss Snoopy coming out at the end. Isn't your enjoyment impaired?
Don't worry I can run every ballet note for note in my brain...
Jazz, we're talking here.
Go on, another time, another place.
Uh, nice piano. Probably get a lot of complaints from the neighbors -- heh... It's another time, Julian, another place. If I told you Bobby Vomit, Johnny Crunch, and Colleen Sutton were the ones you were complaining about, the ones who tried to rip you off, what would your reaction be?
Shock.
Shock.
And if I told you that you already knew all that shit, and that you had them killed, what would you do then?
And if I told you that you already knew all that shit, and that you had them killed, what would you do then?
Golly, I'd probably faint.
Actually you're a bit off in the motivation department... I mean, revenge is so... Bronson. Wait, where's the third C.D.? How could you come here without proof? It's a three piece set here! A computer disc from Colleen, Bobby's computer disc, and Johnny's computer disc. Together they make, oh fucking forget it!
Yeah, yeah, I know the third one unscrambles the high bits and the low bits. Shit, just start torturing me, man. I didn't even know Johnny had a disc and I can't deal with any 'Don't play games with me, Mr. Fairlane' bullshit.

Don't play games... ugh. Did you say you don't have the third... ugh. I'm not going to torture <u>you</u>, Ford.
It doesn't have to be like this?
Oh God, please, <u>don't</u>!
<u>Okay</u>! Okay. You got me. Boy, you guys are tough. I have the third disc. Indeed. I. Do. Yes, sir. Yeah you assholes, it's in a very safe place with instructions to have it sent directly to the police if I don't make a phone call by seven o'clock. So if you'll excuse us...
It's 7:30. You really should get a watch.
It's 7:30. You really should get a watch.
Ah, I didn't say seven <u>P</u>.M., now did I?
I just gave up smoking. A last drink?
I'm running a little late. You see, I'm having a party at <u>THE</u> Club to introduce the new lead singer for Black Vomit. Everyone in the industry will be there, including our friend, Don Cleveland.

What about Don?
What about Don?
Before Black Vomit starts its set, Don will have his head blown off. The papers next week will reveal that he was partners with Bobby, Johnny, and Collie in 'the Grendel Records scam.' He killed them to pay off a debt to 'the mob' or something lame like that. And then the mob iced him. It's all more tasteful than it sounds.
Kill them. Not quickly.
Are you okay?
When I say 'no,' run for the door.
Oh, wait. One sec. Open the window.
Shit.
Ciao.
You'd said something about proof...
Oh please, Ford, I'll do any --
And may I suggest for dessert, the five copies I made...
Fuck me...
Fuck me...
Maybe later, but first I want like to know why you'd steal from your own company...

Yeah, it's pretty amazing how much cash you gotta give to the actual artists who create the music. Those ingrates really take a bite. But seriously, when Pops died, you got Vomit, Crunch, and Sutton to help finance a C.D. Cleans operation. You got greedy and they tried to get the three discs together to threaten you, but...

What is this, are you holding a microphone behind my head?
Man, Julian, that accident took away more than your hearing.
Accident? Accident! You naive pussball, when I realized my life of music could only be a life of music industry. I <u>cut my fucking</u> <u>ears off</u> so I'd only hear <u>my</u> music. Here, look.
I'm still the king!

Hebedeebuh. Hebedeebuh. Maybe I did die in the explosion.
This isn't music!
It is to us! It's computerised.
I don't believe it. Getting paid to be the asshole you always were.

I am told it is difficult to pay the phone bill with gold chains and V.C.R.s. There's four thousand here.

That's crazy. You lost the Frog in the subway and you blew our cover. If they haven't moved already they're not gonna move now.
