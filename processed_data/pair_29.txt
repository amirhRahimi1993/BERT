Did your Uncle get arrested?
The fuckin' Trooper was so embarrassed he didn't do anything. The fuckin' guy had been drivin' around in my Uncle's car all night lookin' for the house.
It's a good thing no one's Irish here.
I'm Irish.
Chuck, let's go.
You're walkin' bitch, Will's takin' the car.
What's up guys?
Why don't you beat off at your house?
Why don't you beat off at your house?
I don't have a VCR at my house.
Oh my God, I got the most fucked up thing I been meanin' to tell you.
Save it for your mother, funny guy. We heard it before.
Save it for your mother, funny guy. We heard it before.
Oh, Morgan.
What'd you say about me?
Shut the fuck up.
Hey, asshole. Happy Birthday.
You thought we forgot, didn't you? I know I'm gettin' my licks in.
Me and Bill scraped together the parts, worked on it. Morgan was out panhandlin' every day.
Fuck you, I did the body work. Whose fuckin' router you think sanded out all that bondo?
Fuck you, I did the body work. Whose fuckin' router you think sanded out all that bondo?
Guy's been up my ass for two years about a fuckin' job. I had to let him help with the car.
I'm not sure--
--These circumstances are mitigated. Right now. They're mitigated.
Will, our offer starts you at eighty- four thousand a year, plus benefits.
Retainer...
Retainer...
You want us to give you cash right now?
You want us to give you cash right now?
Allegedly, what I am saying is your situation will be concurrently improved if I had two hundred sheets in my pocket right now.
I don't think I...Larry?
I have about seventy-three...
I have about seventy-three...
Will you take a check?
Will you take a check?
Come now...what do you think I am, a juvinile? You don't got any money on you right now. You think I'm gonna take a check? EXECUTIVE It's fine, John, I can cover the rest.
What class did you say that was?
History.
History.
How'd you like that course?
How'd you like that course?
Good, it was all right.
Good, it was all right.
History? Just "history?" It must have been a survey course then.
Hey, come on pal we're in classes all day. That's one thing about Harvard never seizes to amaze me, everybody's talkin' about school all the time.
Hey, I'm the last guy to want to talk about school at the bar. But as long as you're here I want to "seize" the opportunity to ask you a question.
To tell you the truth, I wasn't there much. The class was rather elementary.
Elementary? Oh, I don't doubt that it was. I remember the class, it was just between recess and lunch.
All right, are we gonna have a problem?
There's no problem. I was just hoping you could give me some insight into the evolution of the market economy in the early colonies. My contention is that prior to the Revolutionary War the economic modalities especially of the southern colonies could most aptly be characterized as agrarian pre- capitalist and...
So why do you think I should work for the National Security Agency?
Well, you'd be working on the cutting edge. You'd be exposed to the kind of technology you couldn't see anywhere else because we've classified it. Super string theory, Chaos Math, Advanced algorithms--

That's one aspect of what we do.

Come on, that's what you do. You handle more than eighty percent of the intelligence workload. You're seven times the size of the C.I.A.
Come on, that's what you do. You handle more than eighty percent of the intelligence workload. You're seven times the size of the C.I.A.
That's exactly right, Will. So the question as I see it isn't "why should you work for N.S.A." it's "why shouldn't you?"
That's exactly right, Will. So the question as I see it isn't "why should you work for N.S.A." it's "why shouldn't you?"
Why shouldn't I work for the National Security Agency? That's a tough one.
Okay, you're in your bed, Will. Now how old are you?
Seven.
Seven.
And what do you see?
And what do you see?
Somethin's in my room.
Somethin's in my room.
What is it?
What is it?
It's like a small figure, hoverin' over me. Gettin' closer.
You're in a safe place, Will.
It's touching me.
Where is it touching you?
Down there. And I'm nervous.
Down there. And I'm nervous.
You don't have to be nervous, Will.

Building two.
Well, if something was stolen, I should know about it.
No, no. Nothing like that. I just need his name. TERRY I can't give you his name unless you have a complaint.
No, no. Nothing like that. I just need his name. TERRY I can't give you his name unless you have a complaint.
Please, I'm a professor here and it's very important.

Well, he didn't show up for work today...
Oh, I'm sorry.
What're you doing?
What're you doing?
I'm sorry.
What's your name? Don't you walk away from me. This is people's work, you can't graffiti here.
Hey fuck you.
Hey fuck you.
Well... I'll be speaking to your supervisor.
Hello. Gerald Lambeau, M.I.T.
Fuck do you want?
Fuck do you want?
I've spoken with the judge and he's agreed to release you under my supervision.

Really?

Yes. Under two conditions.

What're those?
What're those?
That you meet with me twice a week--
If I agree to this, I walk right now?
That's right.
That's right.
I'll do the work. I'm not going to meet with a therapist.
I'll do the work. I'm not going to meet with a therapist.
Now, it won't be as bad as it sounds, Will. I've already spoken to one therapist, his name is Henry Lipkin and he's a friend of mine. He's also published four books and is widely considered to be one of the brightest men in his field. I'm sure it'll be better than spending the next six months in jail.
This rectangle is subdivided into rectangles. One edge of an inner rectangle is an integer. Can you prove that one edge of the larger rectangle is an integer?
Of course.
Of course.
Okay. How?
Okay. How?
It's an integer proof.
That would be a monumental waste of time, wouldn't it, Will?
I think so.
I think so.
I happen to know so.
What's that?
Half-red, half-black--

Shall we start the, uh...
Yeah, when do I get my hypnosis? You guys been talkin' for twenty minutes.
Oh, for God's sake, Will.
Oh, come on! You're not pinnin' this one on me. He left, I wanted to talk to him for another twenty minutes. I was havin' fun.
Oh, come on! You're not pinnin' this one on me. He left, I wanted to talk to him for another twenty minutes. I was havin' fun.
I told you to cooperate with these people.
I told you to cooperate with these people.
C'mon, that guy was a fuckin' piece of work.
Get out, Will.
Okay...don't forget to get another therapist for next week.
Okay...don't forget to get another therapist for next week.
That's enough.
No.
Will, this is Sean Maguire. Sean, Will Hunting.
This is correct. I see you used Mclullen here--
I don't know what it's called.
I don't know what it's called.
--This can't be right. This is going to be very embarrassing. Have you ever considered--
--This can't be right. This is going to be very embarrassing. Have you ever considered--
I'm pretty sure it's right.
Can I ask you a favor, can we do this at Sean's from now on? 'Cause I leave work to come here and the fuckin' commute is killin' me--
That's fine, but did you ever think--
That's fine, but did you ever think--
It's right. Take it home with you.
It's right. Take it home with you.
Will, what happened at the Tri-tech meeting?

I couldn't go 'cause I had a date. So I sent my cheif negotiator.

Will, on your own time, you can do what you like. When I set up a meeting, with my associates, and you don't show up it reflects poorly on me.

--You know how fuckin' easy this is to me? This is a joke! And I'm sorry you can't do this. I really am. 'Cause if you could I wouldn't be forced to watch you fumble around and fuck it up.
Sure, then you'd have more time to sit around and get drunk. Think of how many fights you could have been in by now.
Well, I'm sorry.
So am I. Yes. That's right, Will. Most days I wish I never met you. Because then I could sleep at night. I wouldn't have to walk around with the knowledge that someone like you was out there. And I wouldn't have to watch you throw it all away.
What are you smiling at?
It's a Carlton Fisk baseball card.
I can come back.
No, that's fine, Will. I was just leaving.
Will.
Hey, how you doin'?

You know, you're no longer required to come here.

Sam called me. From Tri-tech. He says you start working for them next week.
Thank you.
I just want you to know...It's been a pleasure.
I just want you to know...It's been a pleasure.
Bullshit.
This job... Do it if it's what you really want.
I appreciate that.
Yes.
Listen, I'll be nearby so, if you need some help, or you get stuck again, don't be afraid to give me a call.

Who proved the theorem.
Good to meet you.
Pleasure to meet you.
Excuse me, Timmy. Could you help us? We're trying to settle a bet.
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh.
Have you heard of Jonas Salk?
Have you heard of Jonas Salk?
Yeah, cured polio.
Yeah, cured polio.
You've heard of Albert Einstein?
How about Gerald Lambeau? Ever heard of him?
No. LAMBEAU Okay thank you, Timmy.
No. LAMBEAU Okay thank you, Timmy.
So who won the bet?
So who won the bet?
I did.
Sean.
Well, it seems we're in the presence of greatness. Professor Gerald Lambeau is a Field's Medal winner. Combunatorial Mathematics. 1986.
Hello.
The Field's Medal is the Nobel Prize for math. But it's only given out every four years.
Good to see you.
Good to see you.
Good to see you.
Is there someplace we can talk?
I didn't see you at the reunion.
I've been busy.
I've been busy.
You were missed. How long has it been since we've seen each other?

Since Nancy died.

I'm sorry, that damn conference--

I got your card.
I've been busy, Gerry. I got a full schedule.
This kid's special, Sean. I've never seen anything like him.
This kid's special, Sean. I've never seen anything like him.
Not much free time, Gerry. LAMBEAU Have you ever heard of a man named Ramanujan?
Yeah.
He was alive over a hundred years ago. He was Indian. Dots, not feathers...
And he mailed it to Hardy--
--That's right, Sean. He mailed it to a professor at Cambridge who immediately recognized the brilliance in his work and brought Ramanujan to England.

They worked together for the remainder of their lives, producing some of the most exciting math theory ever done. Ramanujan's genius was unparalleled, Sean. This boy is like that. But he's very defensive and I need someone who can get through to him.

Can we do it at my office?

That would be fine.
I got it.
It's on the college.
Any vulnerability he senses, he'll exploit.
I'll be okay.
I'll be okay.
It's a poker game with this young man. Don't let him see what you've got.
Would you excuse us?
Tom.
Tom.
You too, Gerry.
What do you mean "he didn't talk?" You sat there for an hour?
No, he just sat there and counted the seconds until the session was over. It was pretty impressive, actually.
No, he just sat there and counted the seconds until the session was over. It was pretty impressive, actually.
Why would he do that?

To show me he doesn't have to talk to me if he doesn't want to.

Sean, I really don't think you understand--
Sean, I really don't think you understand--
What don't I understand?
He married his cousin.
Who?
Who?
Einstein. Had two marriages, both train-wrecks. The guy never saw his kids, one of whom, I think, ended up in an asylum--
You see, Sean? That's exactly not the point. No one remembers that. They--
I do.
I do.
Well, you're the only one.
Just...take it easy, Gerry.
Look, I don't know what else I can say. I'm not sitting at home every night, twisting my mustache and hatching a plan to ruin the boy's life. But it's important to start early. I was doing advanced mathematics at eighteen and it still took me twenty-three years to do something worthy of a Field's medal.

Now don't do that. Don't you do that! Don't infect him with the idea that it's okay to quit. That it's okay to be a failure, because it's not okay! If you're angry at me for being successful, for being what you could have been--

I don't know... Gotta be at least four to one.

Who is he?

He was my roommate in college.
What should I do?

It's walkin' pretty slow at this point.
You guys are fuckin' sick.
I could go for a Whopper.
Let's hit "Kelly's."
Well, she out did herself today...
I don't got a crush on her.
What happened? You got fired, huh?
Yeah, Morgan. I got fired.
Yeah, Morgan. I got fired.
How fuckin' retarded do you have to be to get shit-canned from that job? How hard is it to push a fuckin' broom?
There goes that fuckin' Barney right now, with his fuckin' "skiin' trip." We should'a kicked that dude's ass.

You're getting defensive, Will.
Look, man. I don't care if you're putting from the rough. There are solid arguments that some of the greatest people in history were gay; Alexander the Great, Caeser, Shakespeare, Oscar Wilde, Napoleon, Gertrude Stein, not to mention Danny Terrio, not many straight men can dance like that.

They never wrote you nothing?
They never wrote you nothing?
No. They wasn't people to write.
This used to be mine. I give it to Grampa when I went away. You reckon they could be dead?

What you figger to do?
It's hard to say. Stay here till mornin' an' then go on over to Uncle John's, I reckon. After that I don't know.
Think she'll hold?
If she does it'll be a miracle outa Scripture.
I ain't no more a preacher, you know.
We know. But ain't none of our folks ever been buried without a few words.
We know. But ain't none of our folks ever been buried without a few words.
I'll say 'em--an' make it short. This here ol' man jus' lived a life an' jus' died out of it. I don't know whether he was good or bad, an' it don't matter much. Heard a fella say a poem once, an' he says, "All that lives is holy." But I wouldn't pray for jus' a ol' man that's dead, because he's awright. If
How about us? Is that the truth for us?

What's the matter?
Casy! What you doin' here?

Thought you was in jail.
Thought you was in jail.
No, I done my time an' got out. Come on in.
Lookie, Tom. We come to work here. They tell us it's gonna be fi' cents. But they was a whole lot of us, so the man says two an' a half cents. Well, a fella can't even eat on that, an' if he got kids... So we says we won't take it. So they druv us off. Now they're payin' you five--but when they
I dunno. Payin' five now.
I dunno. Payin' five now.

I don't expeck we can las' much longer-- some a the folks ain't et for two days. You goin' back tonight?
I aim to.
I aim to.
Well--tell the folks inside how it is, Tom. Tell 'em they're starvin' us and stabbin' theirself in the back. An' as sure as God made little apples it's goin' back to two an' a half jus' as soon as they clear us out.
I'll tell 'em. But I don't know how. Never seen so many guys with guns. Wouldn't even let us talk today.
Try an' tell 'em, Tom. They'll get two an' a half, jus' the minute we're gone. An' you know what that is? That's one ton a peaches picked an' carried for a dollar. That way you can't even buy food enough to keep you alive! Tell 'em to come out with us, Tom! Them peaches is *ripe*. Two days out an' they'll pay *all*

They won't. They're a-gettin' five an' they don't care about nothin' else.
But jus' the minute they ain't strike- breakin' they won't get no five!
I guess that's right. Have to take a beatin' before he'll know.
We was outa food. Tonight we had meat. Not much, but we had it. Think Pa's gonna give up his meat on account a other fellas? An' Rosasharn needs milk. Think Ma's gonna starve that baby jus' cause a bunch a fellas is yellin' outside a gate?

Got to learn, like I'm a-learnin'. Don't know it right yet myself, but I'm tryin' to fin' out. That's why I can't ever be a preacher again. Preacher got to *know*. I don't. I got to *ask*.
Can't tell if you hear it or not. You hear it, Tom?
I hear it. I think they's some guys comin' this way, lots of 'em. We better get outa here.

Tom! They's a whole lot I don't understan', but goin' away ain't gonna ease us. They was the time when we was on the lan'. They was a bound'ry to us then. Ol' folks died off, an' little fellas come, an' we was always one thing-- we was the fambly--kinda whole an' clear. But now we ain't clear no more. They ain't nothin' keeps

That Casy. He might a been a preacher, but--he seen a lot a things clear. He was like a lantern--he helped mw see things too.
Comes night we'll get outa here.
It's jus' till we get some distance. Then you can come out.
I'd hate to get *trapped* in here.
What is it?
Don't know--but it's better'n this.
She's gettin' prettier, Ma.

They was some cops here, Ma. They was takin' down the license numbers. It looks like somebody knows sump'n.

You don't aim to kill nobody, Tom!
No, Ma. Not that. That ain't it. But long as I'm a outlaw, anyways, maybe I can do sump'n. Maybe I can jus' fin' out sump'n. Jus' scrounge aroun' an' try to fin' out what it is that's wrong, an then see if they ain't sump'n could be done about it. But I ain't thought it out clear, Ma. I can't. I don't know

Then it don't matter. Then I'll be all aroun' in the dark. I'll be ever'where--wherever you look. Wherever there's a fight so hungry people can eat, I'll be there.

I shore would like to do that, ma'am, but the fack is, we ain't got but a dime for it. It's all figgered out, I mean--for the trip.
You can't get no loaf a bread for a dime. We only got fifteen-cent loafs.
This here's a fifteen-cent loaf.
Would you--could you see your way to cuttin' off ten cents worth?
You can have this for ten cents.
I don't wanta rob you, ma'am.

Go ahead--Bert says take it.
Which ones?
There, them stripy ones.
Oh, them? Well, no--them's *two* for a penny.
Well, give me two then, ma'am.
Tommy?
Muley! Where's my folks, Muley?
Muley! Where's my folks, Muley?
They gone.
They gone.
I know that! But *where* they gone?
Gone-- --over to your Uncle John's. The whole crowd of 'em, two weeks ago. But they can't stay there either, because John's got *his* notice to get off.
But what's happened? How come they got to get off? We been here fifty years--same place.
But what's happened? How come they got to get off? We been here fifty years--same place.
Ever'body got to get off. Ever'body leavin', goin' to California. My folks, your folks, ever'body's folks. Ever'body but me. I ain't gettin' off.
Ever'body got to get off. Ever'body leavin', goin' to California. My folks, your folks, ever'body's folks. Ever'body but me. I ain't gettin' off.
But who done it?
But who done it?
Listen! That's some of what done it--the dusters. Started it, anyway. Blowin' like this, year after year--blowin' the land away, blowin' the crops away, blowin' us away now.

Are you crazy?

Some say I am. You want to hear what happened?
Some say I am. You want to hear what happened?
That's what I asked you, ain't it?
Well?
They come. They come and pushed me off.
What was the use. He was right. There wasn't a thing in the world I could do about it.
But it don't seem possible--kicked off like that!
But it don't seem possible--kicked off like that!
The rest of my fambly set out for the west--there wasn't nothin' to eat--but I couldn't leave. Somepin' wouldn't let me. So now I just wander around. Sleep wherever I am. I used to tell myself I was lookin' out for things, so when they come back ever'thing would be all right. But I knowed that wan't true. There ain't nothin' to look out
Listen! That's them! Them lights! Come on, we got to hide out!
Hide out for what? We ain't doin' nothin'.
Hide out for what? We ain't doin' nothin'.
You're *trespassin'*! It ain't you lan' no more! An' that's the supr'tendant--with a gun!
All you got to do is lay down an' watch.
Won't they come out here?
Won't they come out here?
I don't think so. One come out here once an' I clipped him from behin' with a fence stake. They ain't bothered since.
Fact of the matter, Muley, after what them dusters done to the land, the tenant system don't work no more. It don't even break even, much less show a profit. One man on a tractor can handle twelve or fourteen of these places. You just pay him a wage and take *all* the crop.
But we couldn't *do* on any less'n what our share is now. The chillun ain't gettin' enough to eat as it is, and they're so ragged we'd be shamed if ever'body else's chillun wasn't the same way.
But we couldn't *do* on any less'n what our share is now. The chillun ain't gettin' enough to eat as it is, and they're so ragged we'd be shamed if ever'body else's chillun wasn't the same way.
I can't help that. All I know is I got my orders. They told me to tell you you got to get off, and that's what I'm telling you.
You mean get off my own land?
Now don't go blaming me. It ain't *my* fault.
Who's the Shawnee Land and Cattle Comp'ny?
It ain't nobody. It's a company.
Then who *do* we shoot?
Brother, I don't know. If I did I'd tell you. But I just don't know *who's* to blame!
Brother, I don't know. If I did I'd tell you. But I just don't know *who's* to blame!
Well, I'm right here to tell you, mister, ain't *nobody* going to push me off *my* land! Grampa took up this land seventy years ago. My pa was born here. We was *all* born on it, and some of us got killed on it, and some died on it. And that's what makes it ourn--bein' born on it, and workin' it, and dyin' on
That's Connie Rivers with her. They're married now. She's due about three-four months.
Why, she wasn't no more'n a kid when I went up.
How you get all this money?
Sol' things, chopped cotton--even Grampa. Got us about two hunnerd dollars all tol'. Shucked out seventy- five for this truck, but we still got nearly a hunnerd and fifty to set out on. I figger we oughta be able to make it on that.

Easy. After all, they ain't but about *twelve* of us, is they?
Either we got to tie him up and *throw* him on the truck, or somepin. He can't stay here.
Can't tie him. Either we'll hurt him or he'll git so mad he'll hurt his self. Reckon we could git him *drunk*?

Ain't no whisky, is they?
Here we go!
California, here we come!
I figger best we leave something like this on him, lest somebody dig him up and make out he been kilt. Lotta times looks like the gov'ment got more interest in a dead man than a live one.
Not be so lonesome, either, knowin' his name is there with 'im, not just' a old fella lonesome underground.
Not be so lonesome, either, knowin' his name is there with 'im, not just' a old fella lonesome underground.
Casy, won't you say a few words?
Got that desert yet. Gotta take her tonight. Take her in the daytime fella says she'll cut your gizzard out.
How's Granma since we got her in the tent?
She's jus' wore out, that's all.
I shore would like to stop here a while an' give her some res' but we on'y got 'bout forty dollars left. I won't feel right till we're there an' all workin' an' a little money comin' in.
Ya know, you're the second fella talked like that. I'd like to hear some more about that.
Me an' you both.
Just in case. Sit up back an' if anybody tries to climb up--let 'im have it.
I ain't got nothin' in *my* han'.
I ain't got nothin' in *my* han'.
Give 'im a fryin' pan.
You wouldn't think jus' reachin' up an' pickin'd get you in the back.
Think I'll walk out an' try to fin' out what all that fuss outside the gate was. Anybody wanta come with me?
Think I'll walk out an' try to fin' out what all that fuss outside the gate was. Anybody wanta come with me?

We gonna stay, ain't we?
We gonna stay, ain't we?
You're tootin' we're gonna stay.
Good wages, eh! Pickin' oranges an' peaches?

Awright, go on! Ain't nobody stoppin' ya!
Awright, go on! Ain't nobody stoppin' ya!
But what about this?
But what about this?
I ain't gonna fret you. Go on!
But what does *that* prove?
Look at 'em! Same yella han'bill-- 800 pickers wanted. Awright, this man wants 800 men. So he prints up 5,000 a them han'bills an' maybe 20,000 people sees 'em. An' maybe two-three thousan' starts movin, wes' account a this han'bill. Two- three thousan' folks that's crazy with worry headin' out for 800 jobs! Does that make sense?
Heh'o Tom. This is Connie, my husband.
If this don't beat all! Well, I see you been busy already!
If this don't beat all! Well, I see you been busy already!
You do not see either!--not yet!
Maybe it's nice on the other side. Them pitchers--them little pos'cards-- they was real pretty.
Aw, sure. This here's jus' a part of it. Ain't no sense a gettin' scairt right off.
Cut it out, Pa. He'p Al with the truck. Don't fret, honey. You goin' to be awright.

Tom, I jus' don't feel like nothin' a tall. Without him I jus' don't wanta live.

It seemed like my life was slipping away, somehow. I was a knot in the middle of a wet rope. Everything was futile and nothing had value.
That's a tragedy. Can I finish my story please? I began my search for meaning. I was a Catholic, Jew, Scientologist, Sufi, Buddhist. I went to a Psychologist, psychiatrist, herbalist, nutritionist, a shaman, and a psychic. And they all pretty much say the same stuff.
A Jew, a shaman, and a herbalist are telling you the same thing? You're insane.

Well, let me see... they tore down the George Orwell monument and put up a bust of George Michael. Main Street's a four-laner, no left turns four to seven. I was married and divorced. And Grosse Pointe is now officially the new sister city to Lower Hutt, New Zealand. We have fiber-optic town meetings every two months.
Here is now there. There is here.

All right mystery man. I want some answers. Let's recap. Spring of '84. Two young lovers with frightening natural chemistry. The girl sits in a seven-hundred dollar prom dress at her father's house waiting for the most romantic night of her young life. The boy never shows up, until now. So, what's the question?
Where have I been?

You see someone?
You see someone?
Uh, no. So you're back now, a decade later, and you want to sort things out with me. The question now is, do I allow you... access... to my being?
Are you going to the reunion?
No. I'm not going. Is that why you're here?
No. I'm not going. Is that why you're here?
That's part of it.

Well, you'll have a ball. You seem to have everything everybody wants when they go back. The car, the suit, the watch. The look. That just leaves the little things, like happiness, character, point of view...

I figured I could pick you up tomorrow around seven o'clock.
Let me get this straight, are you asking me out?

Yes.
Yes.
Unbelievable.
Unbelievable.
Seven it is.
Seven it is.
I'll think about it.
Are you there?
Yes.
Yes.
Pick me up at my father's house at around seven. And don't be late this time.
Hello...?
This night, this reunion will be an important step in our relationship.

You're fucking psycho.

Don't rush to judgement until all the facts are in.
Flowers. That's funny.
As long as I get the laugh.
As long as I get the laugh.
Here. Let me put these in some rubbing alcohol.
You look beautiful.
Okay... Hold on...
...Let me get my coat.
I'll just help myself to a cocktail.
Do you want to get a drink first?
I think they'll probably have booze there.
I think they'll probably have booze there.
Right.
Shoulda brought my gun.
What?
--Yes. Actually we just bought that little Frank Lloyd Wright on Pine Avenue... Debi's a social worker and I mow down insurance claims at Aetna--
We haven't seen each other since high school.
Which would you rather...?
Okay... Would you rather... commit yourself sexually to a four-by-nine cell with former President George Herbert Walker Bush dressed as a super-model for a month, or make love to a otter on crank for a week?

Soft. I'll take the junkie otter, clearly! I'd let the little beast scratch and claw all he wants... Okay. Would you rather make love to the candied corpse of Phyllis Diller--

--She's not dead---

It's just a game...! Alright. Candied Diller, or... wear a hot pork vest across the desert with a fully digested crab apple in your mouth?

Wow. I have to give this some thought.
Wow. I have to give this some thought.
No time.
No time.
Okay, then. Clearly candied Diller.
Even though I left, you never left me. Not just memory but a substance in my blood.
Like heroin?

Too junky-kitschy. Deeper, deeper.

Like love?

Could be. The physical substance of love.
He was trying to kill you, right!
Yes.
Yes.
Not the other way around...?

No.
No.
Is it something you've done?

It's something I do...
...About five years now.
Get the fuck outta here.
Get the fuck outta here.
Seriously, when I left, I joined the Army and took the service exam. They found my psych results fit a certain profile. A certain "Moral flexibility" would be the best way to describe it... I was loaned out to a CIA- sponsored program. It's called "mechanical operations." We sort of found each other...

You're a government spook?
I was, but no... yes... I was before, but now I'm not. It's irrelevant, really. The idea of governments, nations, it's mostly a public relations theory at this point, anyway. But I'll tell you something, until about five months ago, I really enjoyed my work.
Jesus Christ!
Jesus Christ!
Then I started losing my taste for it. Which usually means your time is up. But then I realized it was something entirely different... I started getting the sneaking, dark suspicion that maybe there was... meaning to life.

Will you come with me?

I'm staying here.
I'm staying here.
What if I come back?
What if I come back?
I'll hide.
You don't get to have me. You are a monster, I'm a human being. We're not going to mate.
You don't understand...
You don't understand...
That's because I speak human, and you speak monster.
You kill people.
I have no illusions about the future. What is, is. We make choices. And we become the sum total of our choices. I can live with that.

Other people can't.
Why don't you want to go to your high school reunion?
It's in Michigan. Honestly, what do I have in common with those people? Or with anyone?
You went to school with these people.
Come on.
Come on.
We've spent a lot of time discussing those years. Remember we said that fear is a transfer of the bodily hurt associated by experience with the thing feared, to the thought of the thing. Thus we fear a dog without distinctly imagining its bite.

How do you know?
I just know.
I just know.
Say more.
Say more.
They'll have husbands and wives and children and houses and dogs.... made themselves a part of something. And they can talk about what they do. What am I going to say? "I killed the President of Paraguay with a fork."
You needn't be so frank with me about your work.
Why not. I trust you. You couldn't turn me in because of Doctor-Patient privilege... and I don't want to be "withholding"... and I know where you live.

We're both professionals, Oatman.
We're both professionals, Oatman.
I think what you fear Martin is domesticity. It's the greatest fear that men have who belong to Western Culture. It's centuries old. Like King Phillip, in the 11th or 12th century who decided one day that he was so bored with his dreary life at home with his wife he thought, "Well, wouldn't it be great if we hit the road and fought...

So you're saying that Ulysses-- everything he said to his queen when he came back--everything was a lie? He just wanted to fuck around?
So you're saying that Ulysses-- everything he said to his queen when he came back--everything was a lie? He just wanted to fuck around?
Yes.
Yes.
Mmm.
And how have you been feeling about your... work lately?
Uneasy. Dispassionate. Bored. It's just getting hard to go to work in a good mood. I'm starting to think I've been in the business too long. Last week I did a guy younger than me.
Anyway, that never use to happen. I was always the prodigy. Now I'm just one of the guys.
Maybe some of the discomfort you're feeling is... guilt. Remorse. Over the innocent people you've killed.

If I show up at your door, chances are you did something to bring me there. I don't care about that stuff, anyway.

What stuff?

Morality.
Go to your reunion, Martin. See those people and discover what they mean to you. Try not to kill anybody for a few days, see how you feel.
If I get antsy I'll kill a few small animals.
What else? Say more.
Saw my mom... I'm with Debi, and I'm on my way to the reunion.
Okay. Repeat this after me.
Out Loud?
...I am at home with the me. I am rooted in me, who is on this adventure.
Take a deep breath and realize, that this is me breathing.

How was your day, today, sir?
Effective. But to tell you the truth, I've lost my passion for work.

Do you like the people you work with?

I work alone.

That's it then. That's it. I've always been alone. That's why I'm a good driver. I can handle it. See, I can think on my feet. I survive, I'm a thinker.

You understand the psychology of the job.
You understand the psychology of the job.
I do. Some guys can't adjust to it; they can't handle it.
You look like you're far away. Far away and thinking about other things. I'm right about that, aren't I?
No.
No.
Well, let's just say that sometimes I'm right. Sometimes you are.

Okay.
Okay.
Because your problem is you're bored. And you have a very big mind. I am part of what I call a brain syndicate.
I am part of a network of minds, a group of five people who are all connected, over hundreds, even thousands of miles, through the mind. We can think with each other, think for each other. I can be driving somewhere, sleeping with a woman-- whatever it is-- and at the same time be thinking a thought in someone else's mind, far away. Running
Up on the right.
Up on the right.
And when you think of it, it's not so surprising that a small group of people control the whole world, is it?
What do you want?
I'm setting up a concern that would enable those of us in our rarefied profession to consolidate our efforts.

And you could be... sort of like... a father figure to me....
It's a free-market evolution. You'll wake up to it... c'mon Kid. We used to run together when you were a rookie. I don't want to run against you. This thing's real. Everybody's in.
Not me. So don't paw at me with your dirty little guild.
Not me. So don't paw at me with your dirty little guild.
I'm gonna get you, kid.
I want two eggs poached, hash brown well-done. English muffin for the bread. And a coffee.
Whole-grain pancakes. And an egg- white omelette.
Come on, live a little. I'm sorry about the incident yesterday.
No harm no foul.

A little misunderstanding among my associates.
I told them to kill you and they didn't.

But since we're both here, I think it's time to take a fresh look at our relationship.
But since we're both here, I think it's time to take a fresh look at our relationship.
I didn't get into this business to have "associates." And I don't want to join your Goddamned union. "Loner-- " "Loner gunman." Get it? "On my own." That's the whole point. Why don't you become a cop, or something. You can drink coffee in the morning... with friends!
No deal.
Fine. But we're not going to let you do your job. Because we're gonna do it. And then, after we do your job, we're gonna do another little job...
Fine. But we're not going to let you do your job. Because we're gonna do it. And then, after we do your job, we're gonna do another little job...

Yeah-- after I shoot you through the fucking forehead I'm gonna fuck you in the bullethole.

Nice talk, Sugarmouth.
It's okay. It's Martin The door begins to open revealing Debi and Newberry.
I know what I do isn't moral, per se, but if you could just look past that, you'd see a man worth loving.

Okay.
There you go. I left it blank.
Excellent. Here they come.

Not bad. You?

Hey, Bob.
I'm an attorney. I'm with Moss, Brice & Fromeyer.
That sounds pretty interesting...
Sometimes. I'm in divorce, mainly. Some property. Some personal injury.
Those all seem kind of related...
Well... I have to take this over to Debi.
Here. Take my card. Wait a minute... here's a special one. For top-shelf clients.
Have you seen Debi Newberry?
Nope.
The more things change, the more they Goddamned well stay the same.
I guess.
You always say that. You always say that. I'm telling you, you never met the man.

Here's the news: He hasn't been in Portugal since '90. I know that from the file. Why don't you read the file, man?
In fact, I think I talked with him, in Bonn.

So when are you authorized to use deadly force?
Well, a 'course, taxes provide your basic service-- police and whatnot. But our customers need a little more than just that, you understand? This badge doesn't mean that I am a peace officer.
So it's not a meaningful symbol, or anything. That badge is just the badge of your company. If I look suspicious on your customers' property-- well, under those heightened circumstances you have the authority to, ah... To shoot me.
To shoot you. Correct.

Martin, I don't know where you've been since you abandoned my daughter ten years ago, and I don't care. It was good that you left, and I'm glad you did. So what do you want to talk about? You've grown up a bit. Maybe I had you figured wrong.

This is Annie MacLean.
Yeah. Hello. This is Tom Booker. I got a message you called.
I went on the Internet and found this article about you... It says you're a Horse Whisperer, that you... you help people with horse problems. And you have quite a success rate when it comes to traumatized --
Well, see, truth is, ma'am, I help horses with people's problems.
Well, see, truth is, ma'am, I help horses with people's problems.
Well, you know, however you want to put it -- I got your information from the publisher of the article. I called Montana and your sister-in-law, I think, gave me this number. I'm been hot on your trail you could say because I was hoping you'd consider coming to New York and taking a look at my daughter's horse and possibly --
Well, you know, however you want to put it -- I got your information from the publisher of the article. I called Montana and your sister-in-law, I think, gave me this number. I'm been hot on your trail you could say because I was hoping you'd consider coming to New York and taking a look at my daughter's horse and possibly --
Ma'am, I'm very sorry about your problems and I appreciate what your daughter must be going through, but I'm afraid you've misunderstood whatever it is you read. I don't do that sort of thing.
Ma'am, I'm very sorry about your problems and I appreciate what your daughter must be going through, but I'm afraid you've misunderstood whatever it is you read. I don't do that sort of thing.
Well, if you could just come for the day. New York's only a few hours by plane, I'd have you home by dinner...
Well, if you could just come for the day. New York's only a few hours by plane, I'd have you home by dinner...
Look, even if it was nearer, that's just not what I do. I give clinics. And I'm not even doing them for a while. I'm heading back to Montana right now. I got a ranch to take care of...
Look, even if it was nearer, that's just not what I do. I give clinics. And I'm not even doing them for a while. I'm heading back to Montana right now. I got a ranch to take care of...
I'll pay you for your fare. I'll send you to Montana first class.
I'll pay you for your fare. I'll send you to Montana first class.
Ma'am, first class to Montana is a waste of good money. Now, am I being too polite here or when I say NO in Utah, does that mean YES in New York City?
I, I don't mean to sound insensitive. I understand your situation. But there's nothing I can do. You just called the wrong person, that's all. I hear there are a bunch of therapists in New York. Maybe you should call one of them.
Mr. Booker, if I could just ex --
Mr. Booker, if I could just ex --
I am very sorry, ma'am. Goodbye now.
It's, uh... beautiful country. I had a little bit of a hard time finding the place. There are no signs.
Plenty of signs -- just none of them printed. Who do I get the idea you're not just passing through!
Plenty of signs -- just none of them printed. Who do I get the idea you're not just passing through!
Well... OK... here it is... Uh... I'd like you to take a look at my horse. Now -- it won't take long and if, after that, you still don't feel...
Well... OK... here it is... Uh... I'd like you to take a look at my horse. Now -- it won't take long and if, after that, you still don't feel...
Were you thinking of personally driving me back East?

Oh no. She's here. I brought him along. And my daughter, too. We're staying at Peterson's...
Oh no. She's here. I brought him along. And my daughter, too. We're staying at Peterson's...
You mean you hauled him all the way out here? Just like that?
You mean you hauled him all the way out here? Just like that?
Well... yes... I had a trailer. It's not like I made him run along side of the car.
Well... yes... I had a trailer. It's not like I made him run along side of the car.
All by yourself?
I uh... ha, ha... I don't think I ever met a lady quite like yourself and I appreciate all the pains you've gone through to --
Look! Please! Don't do the "shucks, ma'am" thing again! I've driven a few thousand miles for a few minutes of your time. I've brought him here -- to your neck of the... -- mountains. Just take a look at him. If you still feel the same way, I'll be on the road by morning and you'll never see me again. OK? Deal?
Uh, no. I was gonna take a look now.
You want us to come with you? I just have to run to the main house and give Mr. Peterson a check.
You want us to come with you? I just have to run to the main house and give Mr. Peterson a check.
Doesn't matter.
Doesn't matter.
Grace?... Grace, you want to come with us, take a look at Pilgrim?
When I work with a horse, it's no good just me doing it. It doesn't work that way. The owner needs to be involved too.
Well, that'll be a little complicated --
Well, that'll be a little complicated --
You can make it as complicated or as easy as you like. But she's the one who's gonna be riding him, am I right? So here's the deal. I'm not sure I can do anything, but I'm prepared to give it a go -- -- if you'll help. You have a problem with that?
Look, I'll talk to Grace and call you later--
Excuse me, with all due respect, but this is her decision, not yours. And I don't want to waste anybody's time -- mostly mine.
I don't have a problem with that. It's up to Annie.
Well, it's worth it, really? I mean, how much longer do you think you need to work with Pilgrim?
Well, it's worth it, really? I mean, how much longer do you think you need to work with Pilgrim?
That's up to Pilgrim.
You know, we're branding here tomorrow. If you two want to come by to watch or give a hand, you're welcome.
Branding? I haven't branded in years.
You okay?
It is cocktail hour yet?
So how was your first and last day of branding?
Don't be so sure it's my last. There are a few people back home I'd like to put under a red hot iron.
What?
You ever just stand still for a minute?
You ever just stand still for a minute?
You stand still too long in New York you get hit by a bicycle messenger. You know, sometimes, I get the feeling, Mr. Booker, that you're laughing at me. Why is that?
That's your cue to say you're not laughing at me.
Oh, I see, you write both sides of the conversation?
Oh, I see, you write both sides of the conversation?
It's a man's world, Mr. Booker. Most women have to.
It's a man's world, Mr. Booker. Most women have to.
Well, maybe I am laughing a bit... I just thought, as long as you're here, it would be nice for you to relax into the place a little.
Well, maybe I am laughing a bit... I just thought, as long as you're here, it would be nice for you to relax into the place a little.
Well... It's beautiful country, I'll give you that. And I could see having some kind of vacation place. Retreat. But I don't know how you do it full time. Don't you miss the rest of the world?
Well... It's beautiful country, I'll give you that. And I could see having some kind of vacation place. Retreat. But I don't know how you do it full time. Don't you miss the rest of the world?
What's that to miss?
What's that to miss?
Ha... if you've never lived in a city with museums, theater, music, restaurants, uh... god, a million things, then it's something I can't explain.

You were married to a woman in Chicago?
I once heard Itzhak Perlman guest star with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. He played Rachmaninov's Vocalize Opus 34. No. 14. It was one of the most beautiful pieces of music I ever heard. I actually forgot where I was for a time. You seem surprised?
Well, I, uh... you didn't...
Well, I, uh... you didn't...
Just who's been laughing at who here?
I've decided it's impossible to properly say hello in this place without a hat.
A jogger, huh?
A jogger, huh?
I don't jog, Mr. Booker. I run.

Lucky for you. The grizzlies around here only go for joggers.

You sleeping all right in that house?
You sleeping all right in that house?
I don't sleep all right anywhere. But the house is fine.
I found this old cello case filled with bills and receipts.
Sorry about that. I thought everything got cleared out. R.B. is my wife... ex-wife... Rachel. We used to live in that house together.

It's all right. He's young. Just hold out your hand a little lower so he can get the smell of you.
Oh yes. I forgot.
He's beautiful.
Why don't you ride anymore? Grace told me you used to ride when she was younger.
Why don't you ride anymore? Grace told me you used to ride when she was younger.
She did?
Are you shy, Mr. Booker?
Just polite. Well, maybe you'd like to try riding again, some time before you go home.
Enjoy the day.
You too.
Shit.
Need a lift?
Need a lift?
I can handle it!
The answer's no.
You haven't heard the question yet. Truth is, you'd be doing me a favor. I got all these eager young colts need riding and poor old Rimrock here is feeling kind of left out...

Yeah, it's been a while, but I... I remember the basic ideas...

Five years. My son was born here.
Five years. My son was born here.
Son?

Yeah. I haven't seen him in a while. He used to come to the ranch over summers, but then he started having friends and was going off to college, so... Good boy. Hal. Lives in New York near his mom.
Yeah. I haven't seen him in a while. He used to come to the ranch over summers, but then he started having friends and was going off to college, so... Good boy. Hal. Lives in New York near his mom.
How did you meet her?
How did you meet her?
College. In Illinois. She was playing the cello. I hadn't heard cello music growing up. She had the reddest hair, the bluest eyes. When she played, it was...
Why didn't it work out?
She was never really happy here. She did the best she could.
Grace told me you have a country house in Connecticut. Sounds like a beautiful place.
It is. It's lovely.
It is. It's lovely.
Ever think of moving there full time?
Ever think of moving there full time?
We did at one point. When we thought we'd have more children. And we after tried. We tried everything, but... wasn't meant to be.
I hear that! See, I knew she was never going to be a ranchest, but I wanted to try -- I thought maybe she'd give music lessons to the kids in town or at the school, maybe even recitals. My son would grow up here. Maybe have one or two more. I'd teach 'em what I could. They'd play with my brother's kids. All
That's very important to you, isn't it? Home.
That's very important to you, isn't it? Home.
Yeah, I think it is. And I don't mean everybody's got to be married, have kids -- It's more like, knowing where you're from, where you belong, what feeds you, where you can go no matter what happens... Knowing what you're supposed to be doing while you're here.
Yeah, I think it is. And I don't mean everybody's got to be married, have kids -- It's more like, knowing where you're from, where you belong, what feeds you, where you can go no matter what happens... Knowing what you're supposed to be doing while you're here.
How did you find out all that?
Everything under control?
Not really. I'd forgotten how long it's been since I've done this. And I couldn't get any Parmesan cheese.

Just make yourself comfortable.

I am comfortable.

Ha, ha... all right, well, uh I guess you can bring out the pasta.
You missed a button.
Huh?
This is Mr. Booker, Robert.
Tom.
Now, listen. I want you to stand on him.
What?!
I won't apologize for this. And I won't hide it. Not for anybody.
I won't ask you to.
Oh, God, what are we going to do? I'm supposed to --
Ssshhh... Stand still, Annie. Takes what we've got, just for now. Can you do that?
Show me again.
Annie!
Annie!
One more time.
Summers are short here, Annie. There isn't much of a fall. Before you know it, the roads are closed... the nights get long.
I don't care! We'd be together.
I don't care! We'd be together.
Two people can't just be alone together in the world. At least not us...
Two people can't just be alone together in the world. At least not us...
I can't do this. I can't leave you...
I figured, whenever you decided to go, you'd be all set.
How thoughtful of you. And what if I decide not to go?
I don't know any other way, Annie.
Why?
Then what have we been doing? I mean what was the point?
The point was to love each other.
The point was to love each other.
Why?
Liz is taking care of him. The doctor said the sooner you start therapy the better the chances are you can --
I can't even get out of bed yet! You're already putting me in therapy!!
Why don't you go lie down?
I don't want to lie down. I've been lying down enough.
Dad'll pick you up today, all right?
Okay.
Oh, honey... What happened?
Doesn't matter. I... I don't want to come back, that's all.
Doesn't matter. I... I don't want to come back, that's all.
Oh. Well, what are you going to do? You have to go to school, honey. I mean, what --

I'm not coming back! That's it! I want to go home!

I brought it to you in the hospital.

No, you didn't.

Doesn't matter.
Have you decided about Pilgrim?
What about him?
What about him?
Well... how you feel all right about telling Liz to put him down...
Well... how you feel all right about telling Liz to put him down...
I think we should. It's not fair to let him suffer. He's not much use anymore. He'd hate living like that.
I think we should. It's not fair to let him suffer. He's not much use anymore. He'd hate living like that.
I think that's... very compassionate and... mature way of looking at it.

Mom?
Mom?
Yeah?
Yeah?
Maybe they should put me down too.
Maybe they should put me down too.
What?
What?
I mean, I'm not much use anymore. Why can't they be compassionate to me?
You want to take your bath? We have to get up early tomorrow. You may not have enough time to --
Fine -- I'll take my bath.
No, I don't mean you have to. It's just that we may not have enough --
-- enough time tomorrow. I know.
-- enough time tomorrow. I know.
Look, if you want to take it in the morning, that's fine.
Look, if you want to take it in the morning, that's fine.
I don't care.
IT'S ALMOST LUNCHTIME. ARE YOU HUNGRY!?
Whatever you want.
Whatever you want.
Fine!
Fine!

You should call your dad before it gets too late.
I already did. This morning. When you went running.
I already did. This morning. When you went running.
Oh. You didn't tell me.
Oh. You didn't tell me.
I didn't know I had to.
I didn't know I had to.
You don't.
Would you like to see that?
I don't care.
I don't care.
I don't care.
This'll be nice. We haven't seen any of the sights yet. It's history. When I was thirteen I used to love seeing things like this.
You were never thirteen, Mom.
How long is this going to go on?
What?
What?
You know what I mean? Is this it now? Is this the way we're going to be from now on?
Do you want us to turn around and go back home? Do you?
What are you asking me for? You didn't ask me if I wanted to come in the first place -- now I get to decide? Forget it!
Who do you think I'm doing this for? I'm doing this for you!
Bullshit! It's about you! About you deciding! About you always being right! You always getting everything your way, controlling everybody -- like we work for you or something!
Bullshit! It's about you! About you deciding! About you always being right! You always getting everything your way, controlling everybody -- like we work for you or something!
I don't believe this!

You just want to get away from Daddy and you're using me to do it!
You just want to get away from Daddy and you're using me to do it!
That's not true! Whatever problems your father and I are having, have nothing to do with this.
That's not true! Whatever problems your father and I are having, have nothing to do with this.
You're amazing! You act like I don't live in that house! Don't you think I hear the two of you!? Don't you think I can tell what's going on? I'm not five years old, Mom! You want to divorce Daddy and Daddy doesn't want to.
You're amazing! You act like I don't live in that house! Don't you think I hear the two of you!? Don't you think I can tell what's going on? I'm not five years old, Mom! You want to divorce Daddy and Daddy doesn't want to.
Did he tell you that?

He doesn't have to! It's, like, so obvious you can't stand him.
He doesn't have to! It's, like, so obvious you can't stand him.
That's not true!
That's not true!
Then why do you want to leave?
Then why do you want to leave?
It's... it's not that simple to explain. I know you think it is, but it's not. The truth is, I don't really know what I want to do. I don't have all the answers.
It's... it's not that simple to explain. I know you think it is, but it's not. The truth is, I don't really know what I want to do. I don't have all the answers.
No, you just act like you do.
You buckled up? You cold?
Little.
Gee, this looks like a fun place.
Don't they believe in signs here?

What would they say? "Ten miles to big rock." "Twenty miles to bigger rock."

There was supposed to be a turn off. Did I miss it?
There was supposed to be a turn off. Did I miss it?
I didn't see it.
He's still sitting in that damn field.
I think they call it a pasture.
We'll have more room because we're moving onto the ranch. They have this empty house near this creek. It's actually pretty... OK... I love you. Dad wants to talk to you.
Hi.
Did you ask him to come visit?
You already did.
You already did.
Did he mention it?
Did he mention it?
Yeah, he's going to think about it. You want me to pack for you?
You got everything you need?
If I had everything I need, I wouldn't be going to physical therapy.
Honey, come on. Would you like to stay in town for dinner? Maybe see what movie's playing tonight?
Why? There's no food in the house?
Why? There's no food in the house?
No. I just thought... forget it.
I'll come.
Uh, I don't, honey. Branding? Oooh... I think we'd just be in Mr. Booker's way.
I thought there were too many forks on the table.
Well, one was for salad...
Well, one was for salad...
Mom, they don't mind eating with one fork.
Mom, they don't mind eating with one fork.
You're right. Good.
Does anybody out there want something to drink?
I'll take care of it.
I'll take care of it.
Thanks, honey.
Nothing.
Did you go riding?
Grace? Is everything all right? Can we talk?
About what?
About what?
Well... So you tried riding again?
Well... So you tried riding again?
Yeah. Does that mean I'm cured?!
Yeah. Does that mean I'm cured?!
Honey, nobody's trying to cure you --
Honey, nobody's trying to cure you --
... You worried everything all right now and we'll have to go home?
... You worried everything all right now and we'll have to go home?
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
You... not wanting to go home because you hate daddy so much.
You... not wanting to go home because you hate daddy so much.
Grace, I don't hate your father.
Grace, I don't hate your father.
I can't remember the last time you made him dinner.
I can't remember the last time you made him dinner.
I was just trying to say thank you to Diane and Frank and --
I was just trying to say thank you to Diane and Frank and --
Tom?
Look, I just wanted to say, I think it's great you're riding again. And... and I think I know why you, you needed to do it alone... without anyone knowing...
Yeah, you know everything!!
Yeah, you know everything!!
STOP IT! Why can't I talk to you!!
STOP IT! Why can't I talk to you!!
NO, YOU STOP IT! Stop pretending like you care! Like this really isn't about you and Tom.
NO, YOU STOP IT! Stop pretending like you care! Like this really isn't about you and Tom.
WHAT?! How can you -- I'm sorry if my friendship with Tom bothers you so much, but I happen to value having someone to talk to, especially when my own daughter ignores me night and day because no matter what I say, it's wrong and no matter what I do, it's wrong... I'm sorry I'm such a disappointment to you.
WHAT?! How can you -- I'm sorry if my friendship with Tom bothers you so much, but I happen to value having someone to talk to, especially when my own daughter ignores me night and day because no matter what I say, it's wrong and no matter what I do, it's wrong... I'm sorry I'm such a disappointment to you.
Well, now you know what it feels like.
I don't deserve that. I have never looked at you as a disappointment. If I'm on your back to do better, if I push you to try harder it's because I want you to be the best you can be.
FOR YOU! Because I'm your daughter which means you're the best mother! Isn't that what you're always talking about in interviews -- having it all, the great career, the great family... Proving everybody wrong. Wanting everybody to think you're this perfect woman!
Listen, if... if there's a part of you as parent that... that takes pride in your child -- that, you can look at them and see something you've accomplished as well... if that's wrong, then I'm sorry. But it wasn't my intention. I don't push for me. I do it for you... So you don't waste half your life feeling like you don't know
Yeah, well, you've done a great job.
Well, then I do apologize... But what I'm most sorry for is turning you into a spoiled brat who can only think about what she's feeling... who can't admit when she's wrong and who can't forgive when she's not.
LEAVE ME ALONE!!
What did you say?
I said... I started.
Started what?
My period.
My period.
When? Tonight?
When? Tonight?
I felt it happen downstairs and when I went into the bathroom.
Who's going to want me now?
What?... Oh baby...
What?... Oh baby...
Who's ever going to want me? Nobody will.
Who's ever going to want me? Nobody will.
That's not true.
That's not true.
Why should they?
Why should they?
Because you are... one of the most... incredible, bravest, most beautiful woman I have ever met. The efforts you make. Your courage and your dignity. I don't know where you got it? I honestly don't know how I would have handled all this if I were you.
I'm sorry... about what I said. It's just that -- all those times you and Daddy were trying for another kid, I... I used to pray at night that it would work. And not because of you guys or that I wanted a brother or sister... but... just so I wouldn't have to be...
What?
What?
So special. Because I was the only one. You both wanted me to be so good at everything, so perfect and I wasn't. I was just me. And now I've completely ruined everything, anyway...
Who is it?
Uh, nothing. I'm going to pick it up in the other room -- would you hang this up for me?
Uh, nothing. I'm going to pick it up in the other room -- would you hang this up for me?
Sure.
Let's bring your bags inside.
Wait till you see this -- we have the whole house to ourselves...
What's the matter, honey? Gonna miss Pilgrim?
Tom's gone.
Smokey told me he left last night to look at some horses in Sheriden. He won't be back for three days. I can't believe he didn't want to say goodbye.
Well... honey... you know... that's just not his way. Maybe you can write him a letter or something. Say thank you... Don't think about it... You take care and I'll see you home.
Oh, I miss you. You look beautiful.
So do you.
So do you.
How's everything?
How's everything?
Good.
Good.
Hi.
Great!

Did you speak to Farlow?

Yes. We're suing.
Yes. We're suing.
Is that absolutely necessary? It'll just make it a bigger story.
Is that absolutely necessary? It'll just make it a bigger story.
David, he signed an agreement that he wouldn't talk to the press and he's libeled me by saying I faked the figures. You're not going soft on me, are you?
Well, I suppose we could use another good public feud...
Exactly...
Oh, come on! This is such bullshit! The work is getting done, David. Lucky keeps me on top of everything.
Lucy isn't you. We're losing something without you being here. Now, I know this is a rough time for you, but I think we should make another arrangement.
What the hell does that mean? How much more do I have to do to prove how important this magazine is to me?
If this magazine is so important to you Annie, why are you in Montana?
Uh, yes... Sure, David.
All right. Speak to you then.
It's me.
Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
So, what, uh, what train are you taking?
I should be in by two.

Sure... What's Grace up to?
Riding with Judith.
I'm sorry about last night. I shouldn't have brought it up over the phone.
That's okay. We have to talk about it and we're not always in the same place ... so... I just have to get used to it. What do you want to do about dinner?
That's okay. We have to talk about it and we're not always in the same place ... so... I just have to get used to it. What do you want to do about dinner?
I don't know. We'll figure it out.
Okay. We'll see you later then.
Yeah. Bye.
What about Grace?
She was in pretty bad shape. They've done a C.A.T. Scan -- she has some hemorrhaging...
That bag's almost empty.
No, it's got a little left. They'll be in to change it.
No, it's got a little left. They'll be in to change it.
Robert, you leave it up these people...!
I'm sorry.
Tch. What are you --
What did he say?
Nothing new. He's just going off duty.
I should go get some of her things.
No, let me go.
No, let me go.
No, I'll go. You stay... In case she wakes up.
I saw Judith's parents while you were at the apartment... I wanted to say something... But I... I was so relieved that Grace was still... that it wasn't our daughter.
We're very lucky.
We're very lucky.
The funeral's on Friday.
Oh, uh, I meant to tell you... Alex brought that fabric over...
Okay.
Okay.
It's on the table by the phone. I didn't know what to tell him... ... Whether or not we were... ... if we still we're thinking of redoing the couch.
... And uh... Mario called about moving the wisteria?
Oh. Right. I'll call him.
"... FRESH, WIND IN HER HAIR... LIFE WITHOUT CARE... SHE'S BROKE... BUT IT'S 'OK'...
Sing it to me, Frankie!
Sing it to me, Frankie!
How's my pregnant chick!
You can hardly get your arms around me. How depressing. You're so early.
I had to excuse myself from a meeting. It's ridiculous. I kept thinking about the baby... you... and, I swear, I was going to start bawling right into my briefs.

Aw... that's so sweet.
Aw... that's so sweet.
I love you.
I love you.
Do you? Do you really?
You've got to stop doing that?
Doing what?
Doing what?
Helping all the time! Running to her every time she trips or falls... Anticipating her all the time.
How was the dinner?
All our "favorite" people were there saying all their "favorite" things about their "favorite" subjects. I thought to myself, we've been friends with these people almost twenty years and nobody knows anybody. We're so afraid we won't like each other and have nobody go to dinners with.

Why did you go?
Why did you go?
They're still our friends, Annie. It's nothing serious. You kid about them all the time... And I could tell Paul really appreciated me being there.
Did you get a hold of that horse guy?
Yeah.
Yeah.
What did he say?
What did he say?
No.
What was I saying?
About us going someplace warm... Someplace Grace'll have to wear shorts or bathing suits or summer dresses...
I don't understand. You just said he said no.
He did, but... I think I can change his mind.
He did, but... I think I can change his mind.
That's the craziest thing I ever heard. Absolutely not.
That's the craziest thing I ever heard. Absolutely not.
Robert, Grace isn't adjusting to school. And she can't sit in this apartment all day... I think it would be good for her.

NO! What are you -- you're serious about this?

I've called Liz. They can set me up with a trailer for Pilgrim. I thought we'd stay at motels along the way...

You've already made arrangements!?

No. I was just researching. Calm down.

I come home and you tell me we're going to drive a psychotic horse to Montana! I can't just pick up and leave...

What... Bo-... What about the magazine?
What... Bo-... What about the magazine?
I'm in charge. I went back very soon after the accident. They didn't expect me for a couple of months. I'll just take that time now... I can still oversee things from Montana... Take my fax... My computer...
No. It's, uh... No, I really don't think it's a good idea
Why?!
Why?!
Her psychiatrist... said... she needs security now... stability...

I can't say he's been all that effective with her.

Are you a psychiatrist? He said it takes time.

I don't care what he says! We have to do something, Robert! I can't sit here and trust everything's going to work out just by pretending it will.
I don't care what he says! We have to do something, Robert! I can't sit here and trust everything's going to work out just by pretending it will.
I'm not pretending anything!
I really wish I could understand why you think this is so necessary.
Robert, we're losing her. We're losing her. I don't care what the doctors say. The truth is, they don't know anymore than we do -- less, when it comes to Grace... This may not sound sensible or... logical, but nobody's suggesting anything better. I can't explain it, Robert. I just have this feeling... this annoying... bloody feeling that if... if, somehow, Pilgrim can be
What if she doesn't want to go?
She will if you think she should.
She will if you think she should.
And you think it's best if I don't come.
And you think it's best if I don't come.
No, that's not what I said. I'm not a dictator. If you feel you should come, then come. Just do whatever you think is right.
Yeah. She seems to be getting more comfortable on the ranch, which is why I said yes to this move. But, whenever it's just the two of us, I don't know... Anyway... what's happening with the Delco lawsuit?
Taking forever. I just got an additional list of sixty-two employees to interview before Monday. I don't know how I'm going to do it.
Taking forever. I just got an additional list of sixty-two employees to interview before Monday. I don't know how I'm going to do it.
Well, it's good that you're there.
So, how are you doing in Marlboro country? Is the magazine complaining at all?
Yeah, but nothing I can't handle. Lucy tells me she thinks Gottchalks's plotting, but what else is new.
Yeah, but nothing I can't handle. Lucy tells me she thinks Gottchalks's plotting, but what else is new.
When are you coming home?
When are you coming home?
You know, I just asked that myself tonight. He doesn't know.

Well then... maybe I will take some time... come visit.

Okay.
I miss you, Annie.
I know. We miss you too.
I know. We miss you too.
Good night.
Good night.
Night.
I thought you guys were going to call me.
Oh, Robert, I'm sorry. We were so tired from the branding. Grace barely made it to her bed and I didn't have the energy to take my clothes off.
Oh, Robert, I'm sorry. We were so tired from the branding. Grace barely made it to her bed and I didn't have the energy to take my clothes off.
Oh well... branding will do that to you.
Oh well... branding will do that to you.
Everything all right.
Everything all right.
Huh-huh. You?
Huh-huh. You?
Fine. Actually, today was a good day. You should have seen her.
Fine. Actually, today was a good day. You should have seen her.
I wish I did.
Well, uh the real reason I called, actually, was to tell you I saw Lucy at Jo-Jo's tonight and she seems very worried.
About what?
About what?
Apparently, Gottschalk's been seen around town lunching with some very prominent magazine editors. Lucy said she tried to call you, but no one answered so she faxed you the list of names. She said one of them have contracts up fairly soon.

Oh. I didn't look at my faxes today. We left before sunrise.
Oh. I didn't look at my faxes today. We left before sunrise.
Honey, I hope you're not endangering your position. Listen, if you need to come back and you want me to come take over, for a while, I'll work it out. I mean, the firm's got other lawyers, but the magazine's got only one of you.
Small bed. Maybe I should sleep in the barn.
You're allergic to hay.

I apologize for the surprise, but the days only opened yesterday and I figured...

I can see why you put your faith in him. He's a genuine... good guy... Good at what he does. That's rare.
You were right about coming here. I'm sorry for not thinking...
No, it's okay. Believe me, there were plenty of times I didn't know what the hell was right.
No, it's okay. Believe me, there were plenty of times I didn't know what the hell was right.
How are you feeling about work?
How are you feeling about work?
Let's not talk about that now.
Are you going to stay in the city or go up to Connecticut?
Connecticut. I told the office I'd work out of there next week. When are you planning to start back?
Connecticut. I told the office I'd work out of there next week. When are you planning to start back?
Probably first thing in the morning. It's too late to start now. I'm going to try not to do too much driving in the dark.

May I have a suggestion?
May I have a suggestion?
Yeah, what?
Yeah, what?
Take your time.
Take your time.
What do you mean?
I'll tell you something, Annie -- I stood there looking at what was happening to that horse... And, I swear, it felt like the same thing was happening to me.
I don't understa-
I don't understa-
And I have two choices. I can either fight the way things are, or accept them. See, I always knew I loved you more. Didn't bother me. I always felt lucky... a little amazed... that such a vibrant, beautiful woman would want to be with a man like me... And I guess I thought as long as I did everything right -- if I
Yes?
Hi. Um, there doesn't seem to be any hotel room available and someone told me to come here and ask for "Tubab" who might to have a place for me to stay. Are you "Tubab"?

No. I am a "tubab."
No. I am a "tubab."
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
Tubab means white man.
Was the trip okay?
Mmm. I made good time. Pilgrim's in the back. I found a new stable, but they can't take him until tomorrow.
I have so much to tell you.
You want to take a walk with me?
You want to take a walk with me?
Where to?
Where to?
I don't know. Let's just go and... we'll see...
You know, that's interesting. I always wondered when I went into a restaurant what was the difference between a regular steak or a Black Angus steak. I couldn't taste any difference although I could swear one was more tender. I didn't know there was that big a difference between cows... I've never been on a cow farm before. I must say, the bulls seem
Well, get born a bull, got a ninety percent chance of getting castrated and served up as hamburger. On a balance I reckon I'd choose being a cow. Would you mind passing that salad young lady?
Nobody's using it. Silly for her to be driving back and forth when she don't know her way around that well...
Oh, I don't know...
Oh, I don't know...
Well, I know Peterson's. Old place is as good as falling down around your ears.
Well, did you ever think about hiring a business manager?
We have a business manager. The best around.
I'll have another round of that spaghetti if may?
Absolutely. I made enough for an army.
It's so cruel.
No. He had the choice.
No. He had the choice.
What choice!!?
What choice!!?
Either fight the way things are or accept it.
There's coffee inside... I was just bringing this to Tom.
Would you mind if I did? I'd like to talk to him.
Sure. Does your daughter want to come inside?
Uh, no, we're going to dinner... Is this the way to the pasture?
Uh, no, we're going to dinner... Is this the way to the pasture?
Pasture? Oh, that stretch of field near the hill? Yeah.
Mrs. MacLean -- why don't you and daughter stay for dinner?
Oh uh, thank you. No, we don't want to impose.
Oh uh, thank you. No, we don't want to impose.
No imposition. Plenty of food. Gonna get pretty dark soon. Hard to find a place.
How's Peterson's holding up for you?
It's fine. Comfortable. I still can't get used to how dark it gets around here, though. When we leave the ranch, I always hold my breath until I can see the motel.
Where does this go, Diane?
Oh, you can just set up on the dining table. I have to rearrange my shelves tomorrow.
Mm-mm. I never knew him. He died before Frank and I met. This here's... Frank and Tom's mother and father... there's little Frank and Tom...
She calls him Tommy...
She calls him Tommy...
Always did. I think she favored him a little. You tend to when you have more than one, even though you love 'em all the same.
Ha, she loves telling this story about how when he was two years old, he ran off. They found him in the barn, sleeping between two giant hooves of a Percheron stallion. She said that horse was protecting him and nobody could convince her otherwise.
I got a little confused though. The ranch Ellen was talking about -- that's not this one?
Thank you. You're all doing too much.
Oh, it's... I wanted to tell you that, if you'd like, you being so busy, I could take Grace to her therapy exercises for you. I have to go in once a week for shopping anyway.
I'll help you with the coffee.
Well... I know I should reject that offer, but I'm not going to.
Well... I know I should reject that offer, but I'm not going to.
No reason you should, no reason you should.
I was looking in one of your magazines and saw that picture of the couple getting married at the Pyramids. Were you ever in Egypt?
I was there for that shot, actually.
I was there for that shot, actually.
What was it like?
What was it like?
Oh, God -- I think it was the fourth or fifth time I'd been there, so all I remember was the heat and how incompetent the photographer was...
But, uh, Egypt is, well, it's like nothing else. It's like going back in time. I remember as a kid trying to imagine what a kid my age, centuries ago, walking over that same ground, was wondering about or, if they had the same problems as me... and I felt, connected to... to time itself, almost. Ha, I never realized how hard it was
I'd love to go there one time...
I'd love to go there one time...
You and Frank ever take a vacation?
You and Frank ever take a vacation?
Soon. We're going to Branson, Missouri to see my cousin Emma married. Frank loves in there.
Must be nice for you to take a few days off from your work, huh?
Well, I have more than a few days, ha, ha... I uh... I'm sort of... not an editor anymore... right now... First time I've said it out loud.
Well, I have more than a few days, ha, ha... I uh... I'm sort of... not an editor anymore... right now... First time I've said it out loud.
They fired you?
They fired you?
No, it's more like a leave of- Ha, ha, ha. Yeah, they fired me.
No, it's more like a leave of- Ha, ha, ha. Yeah, they fired me.
You don't seem to upset?
You don't seem to upset?
Delayed shock. Or maybe not. I know I could talk my way back if I wanted or... go to another magazine, someplace... Just not sure if I want to.
Delayed shock. Or maybe not. I know I could talk my way back if I wanted or... go to another magazine, someplace... Just not sure if I want to.
Guess you don't have to figure it out until you go home.
Did you always know this was the life you wanted?
I fell in love. After that, I never thought about being anything but a rancher's wife. I never saw it like I was losing some other life, just felt like I was gaining one. I know that's not a popular opinion nowadays and I ain't saying it's the right one. We all have to find the life meant for us.

Frank's a good man.
Frank's a good man.
They don't come better. But I don't deny there are times I wonder about things I won't have. Maybe one day I'll get to see Egypt. Maybe not. But I know if you try too many different lives, you can wind up with no life at all...

Sounds like something Tom would say.
Sounds like something Tom would say.
Yes, it does.
What?
Annie, I'm not good at this kind of talk -- goes round and round a thing but never comes to it -- so let's just say what it is. When you first came here, I didn't like you and I was worried. Tom means a lot to me and this family. Don't go looking here for whatever you looking for. Don't make that man

I don't think anybody can make Tom do anything he didn't want.
I don't think anybody can make Tom do anything he didn't want.
He's a good man, Tom is. He's got a gift, come from heaven above, I swear. But he's still a man. And a woman can lead a man into the middle of a mountain lake -- and still make him think he's on dry land.
Is there anything you need? I'm going food-shopping.
Well, I am going to go after lunch.
Well, I am going to go after lunch.
No, no, I'll go -- just give me a list.
I think I'm going to have my hands full with the son of mine when you leave. Just might be his first broken heart.
Oh, how sweet.
Now, are you sure you want to drive that horse back yourself? There are plenty of people 'round here who do that sort of thing.
I already know the way... and it's not like I have a job I have to rush home for. Between you and me, I could use the time alone.
It's just one night. If I get uncomfortable, I'll go over to Hanks.
Promise?
Promise?
Promise.
Good luck to you, Annie.
You too, Diane.
Annie, it's Liz. How's Grace?
Her leg was shattered so they had to, uh... remove it. She had some bleeding but it's under control.
Her leg was shattered so they had to, uh... remove it. She had some bleeding but it's under control.
Oh God, Annie, I'm so sorry. I... I know you're being hit with a low now, I don't want to take too much of your time but I have to talk to you about Pilgrim.
Wait, uh, I, I don't understand. Start again -- He's alive...
Yes, but he's in a tremendous pain...
Yes, but he's in a tremendous pain...
Well, of course, right...
Liz, listen, the Doctor's here and I just can't, uh... talk now... so --
I understand, but Annie, please...
I understand, but Annie, please...
- See, what you can do for him --...
- See, what you can do for him --...
Annie, no matter what I do, this horse will never be the same.
Annie, no matter what I do, this horse will never be the same.
... I just don't know right now! Do whatever you can and when Grace is --
... I just don't know right now! Do whatever you can and when Grace is --
It isn't right to make him suffer...
It isn't right to make him suffer...
And I can say the same thing about my daughter! But she is suffering! Can you solve that problem! I can't deal with this now, Liz! If you need a yes or no right now, then no -- don't do it! Not until I know Grace is all right. Now, please! Just do what you can. Okay? Please.
Maybe we should give him another sedative.
Problem is, there aren't many volunteers. He's already had enough to sink a battleship. You have a pin, just in case?
Problem is, there aren't many volunteers. He's already had enough to sink a battleship. You have a pin, just in case?
Of course not.
Of course not.
Probably best. You may want to shoot yourself half way to Ohio.
... well, I just think she's got a lot of nerve showing up here. Draggin' that child and that poor animal all the way... You eat with those fingers again and you know what'll happen! Frank, don't you think she's got a nerve?
Oh hell, I don't know... According to Tom, she's a pretty determined woman. Must've thought it was worth it.
Oh hell, I don't know... According to Tom, she's a pretty determined woman. Must've thought it was worth it.
I guess they'll want feeding and all, out here all day long.
Mixed salad.
What?
What?
I believe women from New York eat mixed salads. Ain't that right, Tom?
They're already all settled in, Frank. Anyway, I'm sure Annie wants her privacy.
It's got doors, Diane. Private as can be. Tom?
Play that sweet one you know. The one makes my wife here so friendly.
You!
Oh Frank, don't forget the wedding present -- it's behind the door in the laundry room. I got her a pasta maker from the catalogue... Not that they'll know what to do with it in Branton, Missouri... Probably use it as a planter.
Diane!
Diane!
Frank's touchy about his cousins. Well, it was nice to meet you, Mr. MacLean.
I don't believe they'll expect that.
What, they ain't going forty miles into Choteau everytime they want a hamburger.
I believe so. Saw it on a television show, once.
Well, that's just what we need on a cattle ranch -- a vegetarian from New York.
Ha...
Diane takes care of the books. I don't know how, but at the end of every month, everything adds up to the penny.
Diane takes care of the books. I don't know how, but at the end of every month, everything adds up to the penny.
Ain't brain surgery.
I have some brownies left over. Want one?
No thanks.
Can we take a look at Bronty's foal when we're done here, Dad?
Sure. As long as she don't mind.
Sure. As long as she don't mind.
There's a kid at school says we should've imprint-trained him.
He says if you do it soon as they're born, it makes them real easy to handle later on.
That's what some folks say.
That's what some folks say.
There was this thing on the TV about a guy who does it with geese. He has this airplane and these baby geese all grow up thinking it's their mom, and he flies it and they just follow. You hear 'bout that, Uncle T?
When you figure on branding?
Weekend after next...
Teacher asked me why we raise Black Angus-Herefords 'stead of Pure Herefords.
Tell her they suit the weather better. Their udders are black, 'stead of pink.
Now son, you tell 'em when it came from.
Be honest, I can't say I did it all myself. My grandma helped me get the words right.
I don't believe it.
You know her?
Tom?
Yeah.
Bank out us a couple more men to run the cattle.
We should be fine, then.
They don't get burned by the sun bouncing off the snow. And they're good mother.
Our daddy raised Pure Herefords.
Well, I'd like to welcome Annie and Grace to their first branding...
And next time, Miss Annie, you can run down the calves...
It'd be a whole lot easier to pay the feed end of the month...
I don't think Warren would go for that.
We thought we lost him in the snow storm... Told the kids. Had a funeral for the damn thing. Finally, snow stops. Staring to warm up. I go out and start cleaning the truck... Goddamn if that dog doesn't jump out from the back seat covered in snow... I nearly stained myself.
He thought it was a ghost.
Don't you go to school?
Twice a month they give you a day off to work on the ranch.
Why do you always wear that hat?
Because it fits my head. You want to try it on?
Would you let me ride your horse?
Have you talked to Tom about it?
Have you talked to Tom about it?
Of course I have.
Of course I have.
I don't know... You sure Tom said it's all right?
You wouldn't want to dance with me, would you?
I don't thinks you'd want me tripping all over you in front of everybody.
I don't thinks you'd want me tripping all over you in front of everybody.
I wouldn't let happen.
I wouldn't let happen.
You know, you're a good kid.
Yeah?
Uh, I'm Tom Booker. Your mother around?
She gonna be long?
Probably. She's on the phone twenty- three hours a day.
Probably. She's on the phone twenty- three hours a day.
What does she do?
What does she do?
She's an editor.
She's an editor.
Mmm. An editor.
Mmm. An editor.
Not like books or literature or anything. Just a magazine... Just in case she hasn't told you -- which I'm sure she hasn't -- I don't want to be a part of this, OK?
Isn't it like, obvious?
Not to me. Either you want to or you don't.
That's not a question, is it?
You're catching on.
Can you drive?
Drive? I'm not old enough yet.
Drive? I'm not old enough yet.
It's never too soon to start.
I can't...
I don't have all day.
Put the key in and turn it. The right pedal is gas, the other one's the brake.
I don't know if I can with my leg.
I don't know if I can with my leg.
Well, there's only one way to find out. Give it a little gas.
Just follow this. Nothing to it. I'm going to shut my eyes here for a little while. Just keep going till you run out of road.
I don't know if I can.
I don't know if I can.
Not a question of if you can -- you are. Just keep your eyes on the road and your foot on the pedal and the rest will take care of yourself.
Where did you get Pilgrim from?
We bought him in Kentucky. My mother and I took a trip down there to see him.
We bought him in Kentucky. My mother and I took a trip down there to see him.
That must have been pretty special.
Are you afraid of anything?
Getting old. Not being of much use, I guess. What went on out there, Grace? With Pilgrim?
I won't tell you it'll stop feeling this bad... But I can tell you, you didn't do anything wrong... The same thing would have happened to me... or Frank... or Joe... And there's no sense in looking for a reason why things happen... I used to try and... always came up short. I don't think the why so's important as... what we do with
I know where he goes.
I know where he goes.
I know you do. Don't you disappear. You do whatever you have to, to hold on... I'll tell you one more thing... When Pilgrim reared up to face that truck... you know what I think?... I think that damn horse loved you so much, he was trying to protect you... That's what I think.
I can't... not yet...
There's no hurry. Take you time.
Sure?
Sure.
There's still something going on inside of him I can't reach. So me and Smokey here, we're going to try laying him down. Okay?
What does that mean?
What does that mean?
It's more or less how it sounds. Sometimes it's not pretty to watch. Some horses fight it real hard. Your fella's already shown us he likes a good fight. So if you don't want to watch, I'll call you when it's done.

I want to watch.
Grace, I need you to come with me.
No, you're only going to hurt him some more.
No, you're only going to hurt him some more.
He's not hurt. He's okay. Look at him.
He's not hurt. He's okay. Look at him.
No!
No!
Grace, Listen... you've got to do this. Just trust me one more time.
It's warmer than I thought.
You want to go to a movie tonight?
You want to go to a movie tonight?
I thought your mom's coming up?
I thought your mom's coming up?
So?
My parents are having friends from college over. They're really nice... They have this gorgeous son who wants to be a forest ranger.
Can I come? I'll start a fire...
...Oh, come on! You think the same thing!
I just could never say it!
Do you want to go around by the old road?
Why don't we just cut through the woods?
You want to go down or stay along the river?
We already did the river. Let's go down and across the old bridge. We can circle back.
"... and I said that"...
No, wait, it just goes... "he said he liked to do-"...
Jude, you okay?
I'm okay... I'm okay.
Have you heard from Judith's parents?
No, not yet.
No, not yet.
How's Pilgrim doing?
Dad! I can do it, OK?!
OK, OK.
Do you want something else, honey? We order something else?
No, I'm just not that hungry.
You want to watch some television?
Maybe... look -- just...
Honey, you all right? Did something fall?
NO!
What, sweetheart?
I want to see Pilgrim.
Did you notice -- no cane?
I know. Amazing.
I know. Amazing.
Can we show him Pilgrim, Tom?
Shouldn't we have invited Tom over?
I did. He said he had work to do until late.
IT WAS MY TURN!
YA JUST HAD A TURN. IT WAS NOT.
YA JUST HAD A TURN. IT WAS NOT.
WAS SO!
Don't be such a baby!
You just showing off for her!
You just showing off for her!
You shut up, stupid!
You shut up, stupid!
You're the one who's stupid -- letting her go and fall off your horse!!
Hi. It's a pleasure. I'm very grateful for the way you took in my girls here. I bet you were surprised when they just showed up out of nowhere.
Oh yeah...
I can't believe it's the same horse.
We still have a way to go.
We still have a way to go.
How much longer do you think?
Well, like I told your wife, it's really up to Pilgrim.
I understand...
Is the poverty worse, now, you think?
I haven't been back in over twenty years, but I wouldn't be surprised. The population's larger.
Hey, darlin'.
Hey, Rona. Sorry I'm late.
Hey, Rona. Sorry I'm late.
I wouldn't know what to do if you were on time.
You're looking fit.
Fit? You want to check my teeth. Good crowd today. I think you'll have some fun. You going to stay for dinner?

If it's not too much trouble, I thought I might.

Kind of trouble I'm in the mood for.
Kind of trouble I'm in the mood for.
Oh-oh... Maybe I better get back in the truck.
Oh I clear forget. You had a call from some woman in New York. She sounded pretty wound up.
I don't any woman in New York. But from what I hear, most of them are wound up.
I don't any woman in New York. But from what I hear, most of them are wound up.
The number's by the phone.
What are you looking at, young man?
How long were you married?
How long were you married?
Long enough.
Long enough.
You ever miss it?

Does a horse miss a saddle?
Does a horse miss a saddle?
Sometimes.
You know, Rona, we weren't all that good together even when we were good together.
Honey... I was always good.
Well, that'll happen.
Where did you learn all this stuff?

What stuff is that?

About horses? I'd love to learn more about it myself. Do you offer any private lessons for riders?

What do you mean?
What do you mean?
Well, if the rider's nuts, the horse bolts. That's the whole lesson right there. You have a good day now... Just... keep on freeing yourself up.
Listen to this bullshit. "This is our world now. The world of the electron and the switch, the beauty of the baud. We exist without nationality, skin color, or religious bias. You wage wars, murder, cheat, lie to us and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals. Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of

Welcome to our show!
Hack the Planet!
As you can see, this is just a simple microcassette recorder. Hook it up to the phone and drop in five bucks in quarters.
Record the tones that the coins make. And hang up and get your money back!

Remember, hacking is more than just a crime. It's a survival trait!
Let's keep her.
Waste the dude.
She's rabid, but cute.
See, we're very busy. A TV network that wishes to remain nameless has expressed an interest in our show.
That's it! An electronic army! If I were us, I'd get on the internet, send out a major distress signal.
Hackers of the World, Unite!
Hackers of the World, Unite!
How are you going to take care of the cops?
What's that?
Devil book. The Unix Bible.
What's that?
Dragon book. Compiler design.
Oh yeah? What's that?
The Red Book. NSA Trusted Networks. Otherwise known as the Ugly Red Book that won't fit on a shelf.
Maybe. But, if I were gonna hack some heavy metal, I'd, uh, work my way back through some low security, and try the back door.
Yeah but oh man, wouldn't you just love to get one of those Gibsons, baby? Ooooh!
So what do you think, can I crash at your place tonight?
What is it with this guy?
Shit!
Shh!
Shh!
Was that her top?
Right.
The sensitive type.
I can't. Everybody who touches that thing gets busted, I can't afford to get arrested, I'm sorry.
Maybe I should just go to the bathroom or something.
What?
Check this out. It's a memo about how they're gonna deal with those oil spills that happened on the fourteenth.
Uh... Nikon, can I... can I crash at your place tonight?
Again? Yeah sure.
Active matrix, man. A million psychedelic colors. Man, baby, sweet, ooo!
I want it.
Very impressive.
Super hero like even.
Hold on a second!
Look at this, it's so lean and clean.
Look at this, it's so lean and clean.
Looks like a hacker wrote it.
Oh man. That's universally stupid, man!
Yo, man, you an amateur, man.
Biggest crash in history, front page, New York Times, August 10th, 1988. I thought you was black, man! Yo, man, this is Zero Cool! Oh, shit!
That's far out!
That's far out!
This is Zero Cool, man! Whooo, haha!
Ta-da!
Yo, brain dead, the manual!
Snoop onto them...
...as they snoop onto us.
Well, I got a lot, alright? I don't know how many but... my head hurts.
Yo, everyone check this out. Hey, what's the Da Vinci virus?
Damn!
A worm AND a virus? The plot thickens.
...and your name goes through like seventeen computers a day. 1984, yeah right man, that's a typo. Orwell's here and now, he's living large. We have no names, man, no names. We are nameless. Can I score a fry? Thanks.
Meet Cereal Killer. As in Froot Loops? But he does know things.
What are you, stoned or stupid? You don't hack a bank across state lines from your house, you'll get nailed by the FBI. Where are your brains, in your ass? Don't you know anything?
Stupid, man. It's universally stupid.
Yeah but don't forget God. System operators love to use God. It's that whole male ego thing.
Look, you wanna be elite? You gotta do a righteous hack. None of this accidental shit.
Look, you wanna be elite? You gotta do a righteous hack. None of this accidental shit.
Oh yeah, you want a seriously righteous hack, you score one of those Gibsons man. You know, supercomputers they use to like, do physics, and look for oil and stuff?
Oh yeah, you want a seriously righteous hack, you score one of those Gibsons man. You know, supercomputers they use to like, do physics, and look for oil and stuff?
Ain't no way, man, security's too tight. The big iron?
Cereal, man, you owe me a pack.
It was him, man!
It was him, man!
You're psyched. You need to lay off of that shit.
You're psyched. You need to lay off of that shit.
I'm gonna hit you!
His parents missed Woodstock and he's been making up for it since. Hey, you hear about Joey's bust?
Yeah. Probably had something to do with that bank in Idaho.
Yeah. Probably had something to do with that bank in Idaho.
Do you think he could hack a Gibson?
I want it to have my children!
Yeah, I bet it looks crispy in the dark.
Yeah, I bet it looks crispy in the dark.
Yo, hit the lights.
One-handed!
Difficulty rating?
Nonononono. Truce, you guys. Listen, we got a higher purpose here, alright? A wake up call for the Nintendo Generation. We demand free access to data, well, it comes with some responsibility. When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child, but when I became a man I put away childish things. What...
Phreak and Joey are being framed. We need your help to figure out what's on this disc.
Oh wow, we are fried.
Never send a boy to do a woman's job. With me, we can do it in seven.
Never send a boy to do a woman's job. With me, we can do it in seven.
You're both screwed. I help, we can do it in six.
Well this hasn't happened yet.
Wait a minute, the fourteenth, that's the same day the worm ends its run. I mean... Da Vinci virus, didn't Phreak say that's what he was being charged with? Look... "Infecting ballast programs of Ellingson tankers" - they blame hackers!
Ai! Boom boom aiaiaiaiaee! Alright, that was a little tension breaker, that had to be done, alright?
Cereal.
Cereal.
Yeah?
Yeah?
Go fix the phones.
Go fix the phones.
Roger.
Who's that?
Curtis.
Curtis.
And what's he do?
And what's he do?
That's it, you're looking at it, he just looks slick all day.
You heard of a hacker called Acid Burn? You know who he is?
No, don't know who he is. Do you?
Did you talk to him?
Nope. His mom said he's grounded for his next three lifetimes. He isn't to consort with his computer friends. The secret service is really out to get him. Hey there's a big party tonight, you wanna go?
Yo. Check this out guys, this is insanely great, it's got a 28.8 BPS modem!
Yeah? Display?
Dead.
Dead?
Dead?
Yeah. Like Rigor Mortis, Habeas Corpus.
Due to Mr. Gill's untimely demise and everything, I guess you two will have to improvise the next round.
Right. If I win, you wear a dress on our date.
Dade?
Yeah, mom?
Yeah, mom?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
I'm taking over a TV network.
I'm taking over a TV network.
Finish up, honey, and get to sleep. And happy birthday.
Good morning. You unpack your stuff yet?
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Up all night again, huh?
Up all night again, huh?
Can this wait until both my eyes are open, please?
Can I cut the electricity to his room so he'll sleep normal hours? He's been playing with his computer all night for a solid week. Well yes, he could be playing with himself. Mmm hmm. Yes I'll ask. Dade, you like girls, don't you?
Well, yeah, I just haven't found one as charming as you yet.
Well, yeah, I just haven't found one as charming as you yet.
You haven't been doing anything stupid, right, Dade? Right, Dade?!
You haven't been doing anything stupid, right, Dade? Right, Dade?!
Right, mom. And I'm still a virgin!
How was school?
Hmmm.
Hmmm.
What did we learn in school today?

Revenge.

Aaaah. Did we meet someone special?
Aaaah. Did we meet someone special?
No. No one special.
No. No one special.
Okay, I gotta get back to work. I'm gonna be home late. And would you try and please fill these out?
Right. Anything else, you want me to mow the lawn? Oops, forgot. New York. No grass.
And unpack.
Loser. I can't believe you were only eleven when you wrote this. It's quite an impressive virus. Dade, I know how you might feel about narking on your friends, but, we're hackers. For us, there's no such thing as family and friends. We're each our own country, with temporary allies and enemies. I'd like to make a treaty with you.
I'm sorry. Who are you?
I'm sorry. Who are you?
I'm the one who understands you. Now, can we be allies?
I'm the one who understands you. Now, can we be allies?
Nah. I don't play well with others.
Shit! Come on!
Watch which friends you do play with. A record like yours could land you in jail, get you kicked out of school, no colleges would take you. No future. Exiled from everyone and everything you love.
I'm fine. Oh, and Dade, try to stay out of trouble, okay?
Blow me.
Blow me.
Thank you!
The girl. The girl has the disc I need.
I told you, I don't play well with others.
I told you, I don't play well with others.
Turn on your laptop. Set it to receive a file.
Lauren Murphy is now a wanted felon in the state of Washington. Forgery, Embezzlement, two drug convictions, plus she jumped parole. When she's arrested, she will not have a trial, she will not pass go, she will go directly to jail. Then I change this file back to the original, and your mom disappears.
That's bullshit.
That's bullshit.
What can I tell you. Computers never lie, kid. Your mom will be arrested at work, she'll be handcuffed, and later, strip searched.

You lay a finger on her and I'll kill you.
You lay a finger on her and I'll kill you.
Kid, don't threaten me. There are worse things than death and, uh, I can do all of them!
Talk to me.
I got it. But listen, Kate didn't know what's on it. I mean, she came to me to figure it out. She's not the one who planted the virus. You leave her alone.
I got it. But listen, Kate didn't know what's on it. I mean, she came to me to figure it out. She's not the one who planted the virus. You leave her alone.
Hey, don't worry, kid. If she's innocent, she'll be fine. Your mommy's safe now, okay?
Game's over. Last chance to get out of this without a prison sentence. You're not good enough to beat me, you little shit.
Yeah, maybe I'm not. But we are, you asshole.
Yeah, maybe I'm not. But we are, you asshole.
Give it up! Just give it up.
I found it! I found it!
This is the end, my friend. Thank you for calling!
Crash Override.
Never heard of you. Done anything?
Never heard of you. Done anything?
No.
Yo, showtime, showtime!
What's going on?
That's Razor and Blade.
Razor and Blade.
Look out, man. Lisa Blair, 26 East 7th St., apartment 16, 555-4817, BOOM!
How did you know that?
How did you know that?
I got photographic memory. It's a curse! Lisa!
Seven. Wow! Burn's wetware matches her software!
Burn!
This isn't a virus. It's a worm!
What's this one eat?
What's this one eat?
It nibbles. You see this?
Two days.
And judging by this segment alone, it's already eaten about...
They'll trace you like that man, cops are gonna find you, they're gonna find you with a smoking gun.
Fucked if I care, man.
Fucked if I care, man.
Look, even if you had the passwords, it'll take you ten minutes to get in, and you've still gotta find the files, man, I mean, the cops will have you in... five minutes.
Jesus, I gotta save all your asses. I help, we can do it in five minutes, man.
Okay. Let's go shopping.
Oh, shit! He got me.
Joey's getting stupid busy.
Yes!
We did it!
Here's your class.
My... class. You mean I'm not in your class?
My... class. You mean I'm not in your class?
No, you're not in my class.
Yeah, there's an Olympic size swimming pool up on the roof. Take the stairs over there.
Yeah! Sure.
That's a nice score for a girl.
Think you can do better?
Think you can do better?
I'll give it a shot.
What the hell is going on?
Pool on the roof must have a leak.
He's not in this class.
I said give me time.

He's not enrolled in this class.

You're the moron that's been invading my turf?
What the hell are you doing?
It's cool, I'm just looking.
It's cool, I'm just looking.
It's too much machine for you.
It's too much machine for you.
Yeah?
It has a killer refresh rate.
P6 chip. Triple the speed of the Pentium.
P6 chip. Triple the speed of the Pentium.
Yeah. It's not just the chip, it has a PCI bus. But you knew that.
Yeah. It's not just the chip, it has a PCI bus. But you knew that.
Indeed. RISC architecture is gonna change everything.

Yeah. RISC is good.
You sure this sweet machine's not going to waste?
Crash Override. What was it. "Mess with the Best, Die Like the Rest?"

I don't do dates. But I don't lose either, so you're on.
We need your help.
Do my ears deceive me?
What is it with you? I know we've been playing games, but, we're supposed to be on the same side and we really need your help. I really need your help.
I'm sorry, I can't.
I'm sorry, I can't.
Well, could you just make a copy of the disc? And just hide it in case we get busted, so we have something to give our lawyers, something that hasn't been tampered with? Can you do that?
Thank you.
Okay. I'll copy it.
Okay. I'll copy it.
Okay, thank you.
Kate, listen.
Uh, hold on...
Uh, hold on...
I have to tell you something.
This is every financial transaction Ellingson conducts, yeah? From million dollar deals to the ten bucks some guy pays for gas.
The worm eats a few cents from each transaction.
The worm eats a few cents from each transaction.
And no one's caught it because the money isn't really gone. It's just data being shifted around.
And no one's caught it because the money isn't really gone. It's just data being shifted around.
Right. And when the worm's ready, it zips out with the money and erases its tracks.

Joey got cut off before he got to that part. Check it out. By this point, it's already running at, what, twice the speed as when it started.
Joey got cut off before he got to that part. Check it out. By this point, it's already running at, what, twice the speed as when it started.
Right, and at this rate it ends its run in...
Whoever wrote this needs somebody to take the fall. And that's Phreak, and that's Joey, and that's us. We've got to get the rest of the file, so we can find out where the money is going before the worm disappears, so we can find out WHO created it.
I know, I know who wrote it.
I know, I know who wrote it.
What?
What?
This Ellingson security creep. I gave him a copy of the disc you gave me.

You what?

I didn't know what was on it.
Why did he come to you?
I got a record. I was Zero Cool.
Well that's great. There goes MIT.
I'll make it up to you!
I'll make it up to you!
How?
How?
I'll hack the Gibson.
Shit!!
It's my subway defense system.
Alright, so what have we got?
Well, we have fifty passwords, plus whatever Polaroid head here got inside Ellingson.
There they are!
Razor and Blade! They're flakes!
Razor and Blade! They're flakes!
They're elite! Let's get 'em.
A virus called Da Vinci will cause oil spills at 10:30 AM Eastern Time tomorrow.
It's somehow connected with the worm that's stealing the money.
It's somehow connected with the worm that's stealing the money.
We need your help to overload the Gibson so we can kill the Da Vinci virus and download the worm program.
Ready?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Alright, let's boot up.
It's the Gibson, it's finding us too fast.
Man, there's too many garbage files, I need more time.
Are you crazy? What are you doing?
I'm trying to help you.
Dade.
What?
What?
Thanks for your help.
Oh, wow, she's great.
Yeah.
You look good in a dress.
You would have looked better.
You would have looked better.
Wanna go for a swim?
I can't believe they decided you won.
They didn't. The guys felt it was the only way I'd get a date. Anyway, you're pretty good. You're elite.
They didn't. The guys felt it was the only way I'd get a date. Anyway, you're pretty good. You're elite.
Yeah? You know if you would have said so in the beginning, you would have saved yourself a whole lot of trouble.
You know, I've been having these really weird..
Dreams?
Security, uh Norm, Norm speaking.
Norman? This is Mr. Eddie Vedder, from Accounting. I just had a power surge here at home that wiped out a file I was working on. Listen, I'm in big trouble, do you know anything about computers?

So, um, what's your interest in Kate Libby, eh? Academic? Purely sexual?
Homicidal?
Homicidal?
What's up, man? I'm the Phreak!
Did you find the program for the virus on any of the discs we confiscated?
No. He's either very smart or very stupid.
No. He's either very smart or very stupid.
Then he stashed it somewhere, or he has an accomplice. We'll release him until his indictment, keep tight surveillance, and see if he leads us to your disc.
Gill.
I think we've got something.
It got you seven years probation. No computer, couldn't even use a touch tone phone.
Must have been hell, huh? Zero Cool? A virus has been planted in the Ellingson Mineral computer system. You were our prime suspect, till we trashed your stuff and found no trace of it.
Must have been hell, huh? Zero Cool? A virus has been planted in the Ellingson Mineral computer system. You were our prime suspect, till we trashed your stuff and found no trace of it.
However, we have come to believe that one Joey Pardella is involved in this Ellingson virus. He or perhaps his accomplice has a disk that Mr. Belford needs to disable that virus. We want you to help us find it.

Good.

Red handed! You won't be having any more trouble from them.
You're welcome.
What's going on? Let go of me! Stewardess! I'll never fly this airline again!
There's a new virus in the database.
What's happening?
What's happening?
It's replicating, eating up memory. What do I do?
A rabbit replicates till it overloads a file, then it spreads like cancer.

So what are we supposed to do?
Well luckily, you have a gifted and talented security officer. I traced the hacker's call. The secret service picked him up this morning. I'll just search his files for the original virus code, and then I can eliminate it.
What the hell was that all about?
I had to move fast. The hacker copied my garbage file.

It's hard to tell, there all chewed up.
Loomis, it's over. Leave it alone.
I've seen bodies thrown 50-60 feet from a crash site.
Look, even if by some miracle Michael is conscience, his muscles would be totally useless. Give the troopers a chance to search.
Hang on Mrs. Pierce. Not that tie, on the other side. That's not the only thing your eating Rachel.

I'd assumed Dr. Loomis would be here. Michael Myers was his patient.
If Loomis read memos he's be here. Fortunately his position is more ceremonial then medical. My hope is that he's either transfer, retire, or die.
Watch it.
I can safely say that Michael Myers is now in your hands.

Find this little girl, get her somewhere safe. Call the local T.V. station. Tell them to get people off the streets and behind locked doors.
When he makes that call.
All right. Pierce, do it. Lets check on this little girl.

He's been here.

Let it be Earl. Let the police handle it.
You son of a bitch, you just created a lynch mob.
You haven't got a police force! These men may be the only defense you've got.
Where's that Deputy?
Be here in a minute.
Where's the radio?
Right through the kitchen you'll see the basement stairs. Brady, you know how to use a gun?
How's it powered?
Batteries. I planned the generator for the house next week. I wished I hadn't waited. This is squawk 79er zero of Haddonfield broadcasting on the state police emergency frequency. Can anyone hear me?
It's over.
Yes. Michael Myers is in hell, buried, where he belongs.
These kids aren't likely to forget.
They've survived this ordeal, they'll survive it's memory.

The only things missing were some Halloween masks, rope, a set of knives. What does that sound like to you?
You're going to be late at the Doyles, Annie.
Huh?
You're going to be late!
He shouts, too.
Why didn't you wait for me?
We did. Fifteen minutes. You totally never showed up.

It's been totally charted.
We just talked.

Old jerko got caught throwing eggs and soaping windows. His parents grounded him for the weekend. He can't come over tonight.
Well, are we still on for tonight?
I wouldn't want to get you in deep trouble, Lynda.

Exploring uncharted territory?
Shit!
I have a place for that.
I have a place for that.
I forgot my chemistry book.
I'M baby sitting for the Doyles. It's only three houses away. We can keep each other company.
Terrific. I've got three choices. Watch the kid sleep, listen to Lynda screw, or talk to you.
Look.
Look where?
Look where?
Behind that bush there.
I don't see anything.
That man who drove by so fast, the one you yelled at.

Subtle, isn't he? Hey creep!
He was standing right here.
Poor Laurie. You scared another one away.
Poor Laurie. You scared another one away.
Cute.
It's tragic. You never go out. You must have a small fortune stashed from babysitting so much.
The guys think I'm too smart.
Well, home sweet home. I'll see you later.
Okay. Bye.
Hello?
Why did you hang up on me?

I always said you'd make a fabulous girl scout.
I always said you'd make a fabulous girl scout.
Thanks.
Thanks.
For that matter, I might as well be a girl scout tonight. I plan on making popcorn and watching Doctor Dementia. Six straight hours of horror movies. Little Lindsey Wallace won't know what hit her.
I hate that dog. I'm the only person in the world he doesn't like.
What's this big, big news?

You guys will make a fabulous couple.
You'll have to. He's calling you tomorrow to find out what time to pick you up.
Annie!
Fancy.
This has not been my night. My clothes are in the wash, I spilled butter down the front of me, I got stuck in a window...

He went out drinking beer with Mike Godfrey and he won't be back until late. YOU'LL have to call him tomorrow. Besides, I'm on my way to pick up Paul.
Wait a minute here...
If you watch her, I'll CONSIDER talking to Ben Tramer in the morning.

Deal. Hey, I thought Paul was grounded.
Deal. Hey, I thought Paul was grounded.
He was. Old jerko found a way to sneak out. Listen, I'll call you in an hour or so.
Get him out of here!
Here, Lester.
Lindsey, Lester's barking again and getting on my nerves again.
No, he's not.
Annie, Paul's on the phone!
Lindsey, open the door! I'm locked in the laundry room!
You locked yourself in.
I know. Pull my legs. I'm stuck.
I'm scared.
Then why are you sitting here with half the lights off?

I want to stay here and watch this.
Yes.
Come with me.
Now... First we'll talk a little, then Annie will distract Lindsey and we sneak quietly up the stairs to the first bedroom on the left. Got it?
Okay. First I rip your clothes off...
You idiot!
...Then you rip my clothes off. Then we rip LYNDSEY'S clothes off. I think I've got it.
...Then you rip my clothes off. Then we rip LYNDSEY'S clothes off. I think I've got it.
Totally...
I wonder where they went.
Annie probably took Lindsey out or something. Let's look for a note.
I can't help it. It just keeps ringing.
And I can't keep you interested?
That's great. Now you'll be too drunk to...
Just answer the damn phone.
Just answer the damn phone.
I can't. What if it's the Wallaces!? We'd get Annie in trouble.
Fantastic. Totally.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Want a beer?

Yeah.

Is that all you say?

Yeah, sure.

I'd like to talk to you, if I could.
May be a few minutes. I gotta stick around here...
May be a few minutes. I gotta stick around here...
It's important.
Ten minutes.
I'll be here.
Anybody live here?
Not since 1963, since it happened. Every kid in Haddonfield thinks this place is haunted.

They may be right.
Come on... A skunk could have killed it...
Could have...
A man wouldn't do that...
He isn't a man.
I suppose I do seem a bit sinister for a doctor.
Looks like to me you're just plain scared.
Looks like to me you're just plain scared.
I am. I met him fifteen years ago. I was told there was nothing left, no conscience, no reason, no understanding, in even the most rudimentary sense, of life or death or right or wrong. I met this six- year-old boy with a blank, cold emotionless face and the blackest of eyes, the Devil's eyes. I spent eight years trying to reach him and
What do we do?
He was here, earlier tonight, and he may be coming back. I'm going to wait for him.

I keep thinking I should call the radio and TV stations...

I'll check back in an hour.
Jesus!
You all right?

Sure...
Sure...
Nothing's going on. Just kids playing pranks, trick or treating, partying, getting high... I have the feeling you're way off on this...

Well, it's going to take more than fancy talk to keep me up all night creeping around these bushes.
Well, it's going to take more than fancy talk to keep me up all night creeping around these bushes.
I watched him for fifteen years, sitting in a room staring at a wall, not seeing the wall, seeing past it, seeing THIS NIGHT. He's waited for it, inhumanly patient. Hour after hour, day after day, waiting for some silent, invisible alarm to trigger him. Death has arrived in your little town, sheriff. You can ignore it, or you can help me stop it.

More fancy talk... You want to know what Haddonfield is? Families. Children, all lined up in rows, up and down these streets. You're telling me they're lined up for a slaughterhouse.

They could be.
They could be.
I'll stay out with you tonight, Doctor, just on the chance that you're right. And if you are right, damn you for letting him out.
Where were you? I went back to the Myers house...
I found the car! He's here!
I found the car! He's here!
Where?
Where?
Three blocks down. Get in the car and go up that other street and then back down here. I'm going up the block.
It's totally insane! We have three new cheers to learn in the morning, the game in the afternoon, I get my hair done at five, and the dance is at eight. I'll be totally wiped out!
I think you have too much to do tomorrow.
I think you have too much to do tomorrow.
TOTALLY!

As usual, I don't have anything to do.
As usual, I don't have anything to do.
It's your own fault and I don't feel sorry for you.
I thought you were babysitting tonight.
The only reason she babysits is to have a place to...
Isn't that David Graham? He's cute.
I don't think so...
Annie, some day you're going to get us all in deep trouble.
Totally.
Hi, Laurie, what's up?
Nothing. I was just sitting down for the first time tonight.

Well, she's totally not here.

Just watch.
Lonnie Elam said never to go up there. Lonnie Elam said that's a haunted house. He said real awful stuff happened there once.
Lonnie Elam probably won't get out of the sixth grade.
I gotta go. I'll see you tonight.
See you.
..."how now, cried Arthur. 'Then no one may pass this way without a fight?' 'That is so,' answered the night in a bold and haughty manner..."
I don't like that story.
I don't like that story.
But king Arthur was always your favorite.
Not any more.
Why are they under there?
Why are they under there?
Mom doesn't like me to have them.
'Neutron Man'... 'Laser Man'... I can see why. 'Tarantula Man'...
Laurie, what's the Boogey Man?
Laurie...
I'm so embarrassed. I couldn't face him...
What about the Jack-O-Lantern?

There WAS.

What did he look like?

Can we make the Jack-O-Lantern now?
Tommy, stop it! You're scaring Lindsey.
I saw him...
I saw him...
I said, stop it! There is no bogyman. There's nothing out there. If you don't stop all this, I'm turning off the TV and you go to bed.
Who is it?
Tommy, let me in!
Tommy, I want you to go back upstairs...
What is it, Laurie?
What is it, Laurie?
Be quiet! Get Lindsey and get into the bedroom and lock the door!

It's the bogyman, isn't it?
It's the bogyman, isn't it?
HURRY!
Now I want you to change your clothes, Tommy. We're going to take a walk outside.
Was it the bogyman?
Are you sure?
Yes.
Yes.
How?
How?
I killed him...
I killed him...
But you can't kill the bogyman.
Laurie, you come with us...
No! Do as I say.
Everybody has a good time tonight. Okay, kids, what do you want to do now?
Let's make more popcorn.
Let's make more popcorn.
You've had enough. Why don't we just sit down and watch the rest of this movie.
I'm scared!
There's nothing to be scared of now. Get changed.
Now, I want you to walk to the door, down the stairs and right out the front door.
You're coming with us...
You're coming with us...
Listen to me. I want you to walk down the street to the MacKensie's and knock on their door. You tell them to call the police and send them over here. Do you understand?
Hello.
Hi, Lindsey, this is Paul. Is Annie there?

Okay.
I'm not responsible, Sam.
Of course not.
Of course not.
I've given them his profile.
I've given them his profile.
You must have told them we shocked him into a grinning idiot. Two roadblocks and an all-points bulletin wouldn't stop a five-year-old!
He was your patient, Doctor. If the precautions weren't sufficient, you should have notified...
I notified everybody! Nobody listened.
I notified everybody! Nobody listened.
There's nothing else I can do.

You can get back on the telephone and tell them exactly what walked out of here last night. And tell them where he's going.

PROBABLY going.
PROBABLY going.
I'm wasting time.
Sam, Haddonfield is a hundred and fifty miles from here. How could he get there? He can't drive.
He was doing all right last night. Maybe somebody around here gave him lessons.
...then he gets another physical by the state, and he makes his appearance before the judge. That should take four hours if we're lucky, then we're on our way.
What did you use before?
What did you use before?
Thorazin.

He'll barely be able to sit up.

You don't have anything to worry about. He hasn't spoken a word in 15 years.
Pull up to the entrance!
Shouldn't we pick him up?
Shouldn't we pick him up?
Move it!
What did he say?
He asked me if I could help him find his purple lawnmower.

I don't think this is any time to be funny...

Oh, listen...
Hm-mm. Oh, yeah. I met Phil.
Mmm?
Mmm?
He's the--He looks like Ichabod Crane?
I love that. That's my type.
I can't believe it!
We need more bread and some baked lasa-- uh, lasagne. Hi.
I know. You're an actress with a great flair for shrimp puffs.
I know. You're an actress with a great flair for shrimp puffs.
Uh, no, the shrimp puffs are Holly's. I do the, uh, crêpes caviar.
And the quail is responsible for the quail eggs.
Well, let's hope so.
Hi.
Oh.
Wha-- What kind of things do you build?
Are you really interested?
Are you really interested?
Yeah.
You know, April, people pass by vital structures in this city all the time, and they never take the time to appreciate them. I get the feeling you tune in to your environment.
Oh--
What are your favorite buildings, David?
You want to see some?

Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Well, let's do it.

And then, uh, April...huh?
Great.
I know. It's terrible!
I mean, I've looked everywhere.
No, really, I really like him a lot.
No, really, we mustn't get discouraged.
Hannah will invite some men over who don't look like Ichabod Crane.
Mmm.
We're a big hit.
Oh, in this we're a big hit. Yesterday I auditioned for Come Back Little Sheba. That, I wasn't such a big hit.
Wow, it's the red one?
Oh, it's magnificent!
Oh!
Oh, is that what it is?
Oh, is that what it is?
Uh-- APRIL I-i-it has an o-organic quality, you know.
Uh-- APRIL I-i-it has an o-organic quality, you know.
Right.
Right.
It's almost...almost, uhhh, entirely wholly interdependent, if you know what I mean. I-I... I can't put it into words. The important thing is-is-is it-it breathes.
It's French, though. It really is.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It feels like you're in France.
That's disgusting!
...a monstrosity! Who would do that?
...a monstrosity! Who would do that?
It's really terrible.
Well...we have seen a lot of stuff today, though.
Yeah.
Oh, geez, yeah.
Okay.
Well, I live downtown.
Yeah, I, we both live downtown.
Uh...
It depends on what way you want to go.

Well, wait. You know what? I know.
Well, wait. You know what? I know.
Uh...
Uh...
If...well, if we took the, if we took Fifth, then-then-then we'd get to your house first, yeah?
Well, sometimes, some, uh...
I mean, it's jammed. If we went... um...
I'm telling you, you sounded great. You, uh, you may be surprised.
Oh, I'm just glad we have a catering job this week. I'm real low on money.

And you, you-you're going?

Look, it's just an evening at the opera. Did I, I-I do wrong in accepting?
Oh, that was a wonderful show. I think that's the best show you two ever wrote.
No, the funniest show that Mickey and I ever did was the one we won the Emmy for.
Mm-hm.
Yeah, it was funny, it was very funny. But the show was about the two Frenchmen, now that was funny and it was warm.
We got that idea on that trip to Paris.
Right.
Right.
Hmm?
Hmm?
Do you remember that summer in France? Hannah, you had jet lag for six straight weeks.
I gave blood before and, uh... clothing to the poor.
Okay, Norman, listen, I really want to talk about this at home. I think it's a matter for your analyst...and mine.
Okay, Norman, listen, I really want to talk about this at home. I think it's a matter for your analyst...and mine.
And maybe my lawyer.
Excuse me, are there any more claims?
Only a few. A few. Do you like 'em?
Only a few. A few. Do you like 'em?
I can't resist.

Really? How flattering! Did you try the shrimp puffs?

Listen, you guys are too attractive to be caterers. Something's wrong.
Listen, you guys are too attractive to be caterers. Something's wrong.
We're actresses.

Is this your first job?

Really? Is the food that bad?

Oh no. Not at all.
Here, I stole you a couple of extra clams.
Ah! HOLLY Now.
You're Holly.
Yeah, we're the Stanislavski Catering Company.
Yeah, we're the Stanislavski Catering Company.
Now I'm going to tell you the truth. I really came in here because I was bored stiff by the party.
Now I'm going to tell you the truth. I really came in here because I was bored stiff by the party.
What makes you think we're more interesting?
We saw, um, Pavarotti, eh, uh, in Ernani at the Met, and I cried...
I cry at the opera.
Oh, what, what do you do?
I'm an architect.
Yeah.
What time do you get off?
Yeah.
It's terrific!
The design's deliberately noncontextural. But I wanted to... keep the atmosphere of the street, you know, and the proportions.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
And in the material. That's...that's unpolished red granite.
Oh, it's just so romantic. I just want to put on a long gown...
Yes.
Yes.
...and open the French doors and go on the balcony --
And it's got a handsome partner sitting right beside it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
They fit right in together. And your eye goes along, lulled into complacency, and then...
It's really sad.
And it ruins everything else.
And it ruins everything else.
It does.
Yeah.
Maybe we should start thinking about going home, huh?
Maybe we should start thinking about going home, huh?
Fast.
Oh, gee, I don't know. Um...
Well...
We could...we could do that.
Right. Yeah, but Fifth is so jammed, isn't it?
Y-you live in Chelsea, don't you?
Yes.
Yes.
Well, I-I guess if you live in Chelsea, that's probably first.
Well, I-I guess if you live in Chelsea, that's probably first.
Oh, okay.
So what's the, uh, problem this time?
This time I really think I have something.
So, so, but it was when I was younger, so--
You know, I saw your father this week about his sinus...
You know, I saw your father this week about his sinus...
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
...and, uh, he complained of chest pains.
...and, uh, he complained of chest pains.
Well, this guy's the real hypochondriac of the family. I mean, he's, you know, he's--

You mentioned on the phone that you'd had some dizziness.
You mentioned on the phone that you'd had some dizziness.
Yes, a little dizziness, and I think, I think I'm developing a hearing loss in my right ear ...or my left ear, my, my left...oh, n-n-n-no. No, I'm sorry. It was my right, my right, my right or my left ear.
Now I ca-can't remember.
Let's take a look.
Well, I'm sorry to say you have had a significant drop in the high- decibel range of your right ear.
Really?!
Have you been exposed to a loud noise recently, or did you have a virus?
No, I-I've been perfectly healthy. You know me.
I always, I-I always imagine that I have things.
When did you first notice this?
When did you first notice this?
Oh, uh, about a month ago. Wha- what do I have?
You've had some dizzy spells. What about ringing and buzzing? Have you, uh, noticed any of that?
Yes, now-now that you mention it, uh, I-I-I have, uh, buzzing and also ringing. Ringing and buzzing. Um, am I going deaf, or something?
Yes, now-now that you mention it, uh, I-I-I have, uh, buzzing and also ringing. Ringing and buzzing. Um, am I going deaf, or something?
And it's just in one ear?
And it's just in one ear?
Yes, is it, is it, uh, healthier to have problems in both ears?
What I'd like to do, is to make an appointment for you at the hospital. I'd like to have them run some tests.
The hospital? What kind of tests?
Now, don't get alarmed. These are just more sophisticated audiometry tests than I can run here. I mean, it's, it's nothing.
Well, if it's nothing, then why do I have to go into the hospital at all? I mean, uh, I hear perfectly fine, so I'm, so I'm a little weak on the, on the high decibels. So I, you know, I won't go to the opera.
Well, if it's nothing, then why do I have to go into the hospital at all? I mean, uh, I hear perfectly fine, so I'm, so I'm a little weak on the, on the high decibels. So I, you know, I won't go to the opera.
You know, there's no reason for panic. I just want to rule out some things.

Like what?
Like what?
It's nothing. Will you trust me?
Dusty's just bought a huge house in Southampton and he's in the process of decorating it.
Yeah. It's kind of a weird place, actually. A lotta wall space.
How ya doin', man?
I told him about your work, and he's very excited.
I told him about your work, and he's very excited.
Yeah, I got an Andy Warhol. And I got a Frank Stella, too. Oh, it's very beautiful. Big, weird...you know. If you stare at that Stella too long, the colors just seem to float. It's kinda weird.
What a weirdo that guy is! Paranoid. What's the matter with you?
Look I-I-I'll be okay. I'll be okay.
Look I-I-I'll be okay. I'll be okay.
It's not that big a deal. We just didn't hit it off.

Now, look, you-you-you go on ahead.
Now, look, you-you-you go on ahead.
Are you okay? You look-- You're sweatin'. ELLIOT Yeah. Yeah, I just-just need so- some-some fresh air. It's probably something I ate. I'll-I'll walk. You go ahead.
Hi, Dusty.
Hi.
Are you excited about becoming a collector? DUSTY Yeah.

We nev-- We don't name names! We say the Pope.
We--
...cannot go on the air.
Oh, you know, I, I love that book you lent me. The Easter Parade? You were right. It had very special meaning for me.
How's Frederick? He didn't come.
Oh, well, you know Frederick. One of his moods. Although it wasn't a bad week. He uh, sold a picture.
Oh, great.
Really? So, so, what else? Wh- what are you up to?
Oh, I don't know. My unemployment checks are running out. Um, I was thinking of taking some courses at Columbia with the last of my savings.
Like, uh...?
I don't know exactly.
Yeah.

Oh, my goodness!

Where are you headed?
Where are you headed?
Oh, I was just going to my AA meeting. ELLIOT Oh, my goodness. Well, why do you still go to those? You never tough alcohol.
Well, listen, you didn't know me before Frederick. I'd...I'd start with a beer at about ten in the morning, and...go on.
Oh. You must have been, uh, very unhappy.
Oh. You must have been, uh, very unhappy.
Yeah, unhappy and fat. And I still find the meetings very comforting, you know.
I'll never understand it. You're so bright and charming and beautiful.
Oh, God.

What book did you want to buy? ELLIOT What? Book?
Oh, book? Oh, no, I... I'm killing time. I...I-I just, uh, w-want to browse, uh...
Well, you sure picked the right place. I mean, you can stay here all afternoon, not buy anything and just read.
Unless, of course, if-if you had some time, I mean, we could get some coffee.
No, I don't have time.
No, no. I-I-I understand completely. No problem. Y-you're busy. I-I-I...
You seem tense. Is everything all right? You feel okay?

How-how's Frederick?
Fine. Oh, we went to the Caravaggio exhibition at the Met. It's such a treat to go through a museum with Frederick. I mean...you learn so much. Do you like Caravaggio?
Oh, yes. Who doesn't? Look!
e.e. cummings. I'd like to get you this.
Oh, no, I can't let you get me that. That's too much.
Oh, no, I can't let you get me that. That's too much.
Oh, oh, yes. I-I-I-'d like to, uh, uh, very much.
Oh, oh, yes. I-I-I-'d like to, uh, uh, very much.
No, I don't think so.
No, I don't think so.
I-I read a poem of you and thought of his last week. A poem of his and thought of you last-- You'll be fine, though. Lee walks over to Elliot in the center aisle. She looks at the book.

Yes, I'd...I-I-I'd love, I'd love to get you this.
Well, sure.
Well, sure.
And-and maybe, um...maybe we could discuss it sometime.
Well, thanks a lot.
Thanks for showing me the bookstore. Perhaps you could, uh, take me to an AA meeting sometime. Uh...uh, I'd love to see what goes on.

How's everything?
Oh, you know...I talked to Hannah this morning on the phone, and she said that you two might be going to the country for the weekend.

Yeah, she loves to go out in the woods.
Yeah, she loves to go out in the woods.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
But I go nuts. It's a conflict.
I have to get my teeth cleaned this week.
Oh, that's nice.
I figured I'd get, uh, Frederick and Dusty together.
Oh, yeah, that's really nice of you.
Oh, yeah, that's really nice of you.
Yes. This kid, he's earned a trillion dollars.
Yes. This kid, he's earned a trillion dollars.
Oh.

He's got like six gold records.
He's got like six gold records.
Oh, speaking of records...I bought that Mozart Trio you recommended...
Oh, you-you have that one?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, I would love to hear it.
Oh, and Holly met a wonderful man who loves opera. An architect.
Oh, that's nice. I'd love to see her wind up settled. She's a tense one.
Isn't that beautiful?
I know this. Bach. F Minor Concerto. It's one of my favorites.
Uh...did you ever get around to e.e. cummings?
Yes, he's just adorable.
They have a very large gay clientele, you know, where I get my teeth cleaned, and...all the hygienists now wear gloves because they're afraid of AIDS.
Oh, right.
Did you ever get around to the poem on page a hundred and twelve?
Yes, it made me cry it was so beautiful...so romantic.
And be ready to make light of the offer if she's unresponsive. This has to be done very skillfully, very diplomatically.
Did you ever read this one--?
Elliot! Don't!
Lee! Lee! Lee, I'm in love with you.
Oh!
What are you doing?!
What are you doing?!
I...I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm sorry. I have to talk to you for... There's so much that I want to tell you.
Elliot!
I have been in love with you for so long.
I was looking for you.
I, I must apologize. I-I'm, I-I'm sorry. I'm so mixed up.
I, I must apologize. I-I'm, I-I'm sorry. I'm so mixed up.
Well, how do you expect me to react to such a thing?
Wh--, uh, I know, I know but, I am in love with you.
Oh, don't say those words!
Oh, don't say those words!
I-I, I'm sorry. I know it's terrible.
I-I, I'm sorry. I know it's terrible.
Why, you know the situation.
I know! I-I-I-I, I realize.
What do you expect me to say?
What do you expect me to say?
Hannah and I are in the last stages.
Hannah and I are in the last stages.
Wh-- She's never said anything, and we're very close. She'd tell me such a thing.
Wh-- She's never said anything, and we're very close. She'd tell me such a thing.
Wh--, it-it-it-it, it's so sad. She's crazy about me, but somewhere on the, along the line, I've fallen out of love with her.
Wh--, it-it-it-it, it's so sad. She's crazy about me, but somewhere on the, along the line, I've fallen out of love with her.
Not because of me, I hope.
Not because of me, I hope.
Oh, no, no. Well, yes! I love you.
Oh, no, no. Well, yes! I love you.
Oh, I can't be the cause of anything between you and Hannah. I jus--
Oh, I can't be the cause of anything between you and Hannah. I jus--
Oh, no, no, no. It, uh, it-it-it- it was i-inevitable that Hannah and I part, anyway.
Oh, no, no, no. It, uh, it-it-it- it was i-inevitable that Hannah and I part, anyway.
Why?
Why?
Tch, w-well, for a million reasons.
Tch, w-well, for a million reasons.
But not over me?
But not over me?
Tch, no! We were, we were both going in different directions.
Tch, no! We were, we were both going in different directions.
Poor Hannah.
Poor Hannah.
But-but, but how about you? Do you, do you share any of my feelings? Or is this just an unpleasant embarrassment to you?
But-but, but how about you? Do you, do you share any of my feelings? Or is this just an unpleasant embarrassment to you?
I can't say anything!
I can't say anything!
W-well, please be candid. I, I-I don't want you to feel bad.
W-well, please be candid. I, I-I don't want you to feel bad.
Yes! But I...I have certain feelings for you, but don't make me say anything more, all right?
O-o-o-okay, Lee. Okay, okay. You, you, y-you've said enough. It's my responsibility now. I will work things out.
Look, don't do anything on my behalf. I live with Frederick, and Hannah and I are close.
Look, don't do anything on my behalf. I live with Frederick, and Hannah and I are close.
Yes, but you, you do care about me.
Yes, but you, you do care about me.
Oh, Elliot, please! I can't be a party to this! I'm suddenly wracked with guilt just standing her talking to you on the street!
Your guilt is because you feel the same.
Oh, please, I have to go. I have to get my teeth cleaned.
I thought you weren't coming.
I almost didn't.
I almost didn't.
Lee... uh...
Lee... uh...
I didn't sleep all night.
I didn't sleep all night.
No, no-no-no, I'm sure.
I-I couldn't think where to invite you without taking risks.
I promised myself I wouldn't let this happen till you were living alone. I was so torn when you called.
This is not an easy situation.
I know it isn't.
That was just perfect. You've ruined me for anyone else.
I don't want anyone else ever to have you.
I don't want anyone else ever to have you.
I was so worried I wouldn't compare with Hannah.
I was so worried I wouldn't compare with Hannah.
Oh, my God.
You really do have those thoughts, don't you?
Oh, all the time.
I know she must be a really passionate person.
Yes, she's, she's very warm, but, but it-it's me that wants to be giving to you. I-I-I want to do things for you. Hannah doesn't need me as much. I'm being presumptuous. Not that you need me.
Yes, she's, she's very warm, but, but it-it's me that wants to be giving to you. I-I-I want to do things for you. Hannah doesn't need me as much. I'm being presumptuous. Not that you need me.
I want you to take care of me... And I love when you do things to me.
You've been very cold to me tonight.
No.
No.
Is something wrong?
Is something wrong?
Oh, not here. There are too many people around.
It's over, Elliot. I don't know how to make it any clearer. It's over. I can't see you anymore.
Uh... I-I-I know. I deserve this.
Uh... I-I-I know. I deserve this.
Look, I'm just as much at fault.
Look, I'm just as much at fault.
If-if-if you can believe I have such feelings for you!
If-if-if you can believe I have such feelings for you!
I've got to be honest with you. I met someone else. I've met someone else. I...I told you I wasn't going to wait forever.
But it hasn't been forever.
It's been nearly a year since our first time and you're still married to my sister, which...I now realize is fine because you're probably much more in love with her than you know.
It's been nearly a year since our first time and you're still married to my sister, which...I now realize is fine because you're probably much more in love with her than you know.
Yeah, but we-we made so many plans.
Yeah, but we-we made so many plans.
Yeah. Uh, well, sure we did. An- an-and in a way you led me on, because I truly believed you were unhappy with Hannah. Otherwise, I would never have let myself be drawn in. I was very weak. So were you. Now I've met someone else.
And you're in love overnight?
I care a great deal about him, yes.
I care a great deal about him, yes.
Lee...
Lee...
Ah, it's over! Elliot, I mean it. It's over!
Mm-hm?
Have you tried these? These are wonderful. Holly and her friend made them.
They're fantastic.
Aren't they great?
Aren't they great?
Your sister is an unbelievable cook.
Your sister is an unbelievable cook.
I know! I know!
She has all the cooking talent.
No, she doesn't, either. You've got tons as well.
No, she doesn't, either. You've got tons as well.
Ohhh, but I've eaten five of these.
Great idea.
I know.
I know.
That's where your talent lies.
God, Mickey's such a hypochondriac. I wonder how he'd handle it if there was ever anything really wrong with him?
Let's go have dinner, shall we?
Let's go have dinner, shall we?
Mmm.
You bet.
Holly and April, thanks for helping.
Where're you going?
I've, uh...gotta find, gotta get a phone number in my desk. I forgot to phone Mel Kaufman.
I've, uh...gotta find, gotta get a phone number in my desk. I forgot to phone Mel Kaufman.
It's so late.
It's so late.
Yeah, I know. I-I can't believe I forgot.
Are you in a bad mood?
I don't know. Um...I'm just antsy.
Yes. I know. The last few weeks, you haven't been yourself. And tonight at, tonight at dinner, you, you were kind of curt with me.
Was I?
Was I?
Yes, you were. A-and when I, when I brought up the idea of having a baby, you just, you jumped down my throat.
Yes, you were. A-and when I, when I brought up the idea of having a baby, you just, you jumped down my throat.
Well, I-I don't think it's a very good idea.
Well, I-I don't think it's a very good idea.
Why not?
Why not?
Because it's the last thing in the world we need right now.
Because it's the last thing in the world we need right now.
Why do you say that? Is there something wrong?
Why do you say that? Is there something wrong?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Well, tell me. Should I be worried?
Well, tell me. Should I be worried?
But, you got four children!
But, you got four children!
I want one with you.
I want one with you.
Well...I-I think we should wait till things settle.
Well...I-I think we should wait till things settle.
But what do, what do you-- what's that mean? W-w-we've been, we've been married for four years. How settled can things get?
But what do, what do you-- what's that mean? W-w-we've been, we've been married for four years. How settled can things get?
You know, y-you have some very set plans on how your life should be structured. A-a house, uh, kids, certain schools, a h--, a home in Connecticut. I-it's all very...preconceived.
You know, y-you have some very set plans on how your life should be structured. A-a house, uh, kids, certain schools, a h--, a home in Connecticut. I-it's all very...preconceived.
Yeah, but I...uh--I thought you needed that. When-when-when we met, you said your life was chaos.
Yeah, but I...uh--I thought you needed that. When-when-when we met, you said your life was chaos.
I-I-I know, but there's got to be some give and take.
Oh, let's not--I, I don't know what the hell I'm talking about.
Are you angry with me?
Are you angry with me?
No!
No!
Do you feel, um...are you disenchanted with our marriage?
Do you feel, um...are you disenchanted with our marriage?
I didn't say that.
I didn't say that.
Are you in love with someone else?
Are you in love with someone else?
My God! Wha-what is this? The Gestapo? No.
Well, what? What, wh-what are you not telling me?
What kind of interrogation... Su- supposing I said yes? I-I-I am disenchanted. I am in love with someone else.
What kind of interrogation... Su- supposing I said yes? I-I-I am disenchanted. I am in love with someone else.
Are you?
Are you?
No! But you keep asking these, these awful questions. My God, it's-it's like you want me to say yes!
No! But you keep asking these, these awful questions. My God, it's-it's like you want me to say yes!
What, you, of c-- What are you talking about? Of course not. I'd be destroyed!
Have you been talking to Holly or Lee about us? About our-our personal life?
Me? Of course not. HANNAH There's things Holly wrote about in her script about us that are so...personal they could only have come from you.
I'm not accusing. I'm asking. Do you...do you find me too...too giving? Too-too-too competent? Too-too, I don't know, disgustingly perfect or something?
No.
Well, what is it then? What? Eh, what's come between us? How have I alienated you?
Hannah, my head is throbbing. HANNAH You never want to talk about it. I-- Every time I bring it up, you- you change the subject. What is it? Do you-- We're communicating less and less. You sleep with me less and less.
Do you talk to Holly or Lee behind my back? Do you? You must. They- they seem to know so much about us.
Well, maybe I've asked advice once or twice or-or made a joke.
Well, what do you do? Do-do-do you talk to Holly, or Lee, or what? Do you, do you, do you phone them?
Leave me alone, can you?!
You matter to me. Completely.
It's hard to be around someone who gives so much and-and needs so little in return!
It's so pitch-black tonight. I feel lost.
You're not lost.
...this is a toast! This is a toast.
Get his wine away.
Get his wine away.
This is a toast. You know this beautiful Thanksgiving dinner was all...
I am... I did slave all day.
And we drink to her, and we all congratulate her on her wonderful accomplishment during this last year...her great success in A Doll's House!
I don't know about that. Oh, no, I just, see, I-I've been very, very lucky. W-when I had the kids, I decided to stop working and just, you know, devote myself to having the family, and I've been very, very happy but...I've always secretly hoped that maybe some little gem would come along and tempt me back on the stage...
Yeah.
Yeah.
...just for a second. So, now I got that out of my system and I can go back to the thing that makes me happiest.
Hi. How's she doing?
I am glad to see you.
Don't make it worse, Dad.
Always.
Hi, Mom. How you doing? Here, let me get you some coffee. That's enough of that. What triggered it?
We were making a commercial down at the mayor's office, and there was this young, good-looking salesman...
I want ice! Who's got some-- Oh, there it is.
It's on the table, Dad.
Oh, Mom!
Oh, honey!
I don't understand. I thought that you would be happy.
How can we be happy?
Well, because I never thought of God in my life. Now I'm giving it serious thought.
But Catholicism? Why not your own people?
But Catholicism? Why not your own people?
Because I got off to a wrong foot with my own thing, you know. B-b- b-but I need a dramatic change in my life. FATHER You're gonna believe in Jesus Christ?
Because I got off to a wrong foot with my own thing, you know. B-b- b-but I need a dramatic change in my life. FATHER You're gonna believe in Jesus Christ?
I know it sounds funny, but I'm gonna try.
I know it sounds funny, but I'm gonna try.
But why? We raised you as a Jew.
But why? We raised you as a Jew.
So, just 'cause I was born that way... You know, I'm old enough to make a mature decision.
Why should I be afraid?
Oh! 'Cause you won't exist!
Oh! 'Cause you won't exist!
So?
So?
That thought doesn't terrify you?
Who thinks about such nonsense? Now I'm alive. When I'm dead, I'll be dead.
I don't understand. Aren't you frightened?
I don't understand. Aren't you frightened?
Of what? I'll be unconscious.
Of what? I'll be unconscious.
Yeah, I know. But never to exist again!
Yeah, I know. But never to exist again!
How do you know?
How do you know?
Well, it certainly doesn't look promising.
I'll either be unconscious or I won't. If not, I'll deal with it then. I'm not gonna worry now about what's gonna be when I'm unconscious.
Mom, come out!
Want some coffee or tea?
No, thank you.
How about something to eat?
No, nothing.
Are you sure?
Absolutely.
Absolutely.
Mmm, what am I gonna do with you?
God! And why didn't you come tonight? We all had a terrific time. I really think you would have enjoyed yourself.
I'm going through a period of my life where I just can't be around people. I didn't want to wind up abusing anyone.
I'm going through a period of my life where I just can't be around people. I didn't want to wind up abusing anyone.
You're not going to abuse them. They're all so sweet.
You're not going to abuse them. They're all so sweet.
Lee... you are the only person I can be with...who I really look forward to being with.
Isn't it enough that I can love you?
Mmm...
Mmm...
Hmm?
Hmm?
...you're such a puzzle. So sweet with me and so...contemptuous of everyone else.
Well, there was a time when you were very happy to be only with me. You wanted to learn everything about poetry, about music.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Have I really taught you everything I have to give? I don't think so.
Mmm you never know. They might. He's just trying to do the nice thing.
Because he likes you.
Because he likes you.
Me?
Me?
Yeah.
Elliot lusts after you.
Based on what? You never even see him.
...or films you must see or...
Oh, no, no, no. He's my sister's husband. And I think if you gave him half a chance, you'd like him. He's very intelligent.
Big. Frederick, show him the oils.
They're in the basement.
I don't sell my work by the yard!
Oh, Frederick!
What's the problem?
I'm not interested in what your interior decorator would think, okay?!
Lucy and I kept talking, and I didn't realize how late it had gotten.
You missed a very dull TV show about Auschwitz. More gruesome film clips...and more puzzled intellectuals declaring their mystification over the systematic murder of millions.
You know, you've been very nervous lately.
I can't take this anymore.
I can't take this anymore.
I'm just trying to complete an education I started on you five years ago.
I'm just trying to complete an education I started on you five years ago.
I'm not your pupil. I was, but I'm not.
I'm not your pupil. I was, but I'm not.
When you leave the nest, I just want you to be ready to face the real world.
Like what?
Oh, you know what. I'm suffocating!
Oh, you know what. I'm suffocating!
Oh! Are we going to have this conversation again?
Oh! Are we going to have this conversation again?
Yes, we're going to have this conversation again. I...I have to leave. I have to move out.
Yes, we're going to have this conversation again. I...I have to leave. I have to move out.
Why?
Why?
Because I have to!
Because I have to!
What are you going to use for money?!
What are you going to use for money?!
I don't know. I thought, maybe I'd move in with my parents for a while.
I don't know. I thought, maybe I'd move in with my parents for a while.
Tch, oh. I always told you you would leave me. But...does it have to be now?
Tch, oh. I always told you you would leave me. But...does it have to be now?
Well, maybe it'll only be temporary, but I ha--I have to try.
Well, maybe it'll only be temporary, but I ha--I have to try.
Oh...Lee, you are my whole world. Good God! Have you been kissed tonight?!

No.
No.
Oh, yes, you have!
Oh, yes, you have!
No.
No.
You've been with someone!

Stop accusing me!
Oh, Christ! What's wrong with you?!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Oh, couldn't you say something? You have to slither around behind my back!
Oh, couldn't you say something? You have to slither around behind my back!
I'm saying it now!
I'm saying it now!
So you met somebody else?
So you met somebody else?
Yeah.
But you, God, you knew that was going to happen sooner or later. I can't live like this!
Who is it?
Who is it?
What's the difference?! It's just somebody I met!
What's the difference?! It's just somebody I met!
But who? Where did you meet him?
But who? Where did you meet him?
It doesn't make a difference! I have to move out!
It doesn't make a difference! I have to move out!
You are, you are my only connection to the world!
Oh, God, that's too much responsibility for me. It's not fair! I want a less complicated life, Frederick. I want a husband, maybe even a child before it's too late.
Jesus...Jesus!
Jesus...Jesus!
Oh, God, I don't even know what I want.
Oh, God, I don't even know what I want.
Oh...
Oh...
Tch, oh, what do you get out of me, anyway? I mean... it's not sexual anymore. It's certainly not intellectual. I mean, you're so superior to me in every way that--
Mickey, Mickey, listen, listen.
You know...
In-in-in-instead of the child molestation sketch, why don't we repeat the Cardinal Spellman Ronald Reagan homosexual dance number?
No--
Look at this guy.
Yeah?
Oh, Jesus!
Ron...Ronny, you know you do have to go on in twenty-five minutes.
N-n-no, not that.
Hello?
Hello?
Like--
You don't have a brain tumor. He didn't say you had a brain tumor. MICKEY No, naturally they're not gonna tell you, because, well, you know, th--, sometimes the weaker ones will panic if you tell 'em.
But not you.
But not you.
Oh, God! Do you hear a buzzing? Is there a buzzing?
Mickey, come on, we got a show to do!
I can't keep my mind on the show.
I can't keep my mind on the show.
But there's nothing wrong with you.

If there's nothing wrong with me then why does he want me to come back for tests?!
If there's nothing wrong with me then why does he want me to come back for tests?!
Well, he has to rule out certain things.

Like what?! What?

I don't know. Cancer, I--

Don't say that! I don't want to hear that word! Don't mention that while I'm in the building.
Don't say that! I don't want to hear that word! Don't mention that while I'm in the building.
But you don't have any symptoms!
But you don't have any symptoms!
You--I got the classic symptoms of a brain tumor!
Two months ago, you thought you had a malignant melanoma.
Naturally, I, I--Do you know I--The sudden appearance of a black spot on my back!
Naturally, I, I--Do you know I--The sudden appearance of a black spot on my back!
It was on your shirt!
It was on your shirt!
I--How was I to know?! Everyone was pointing back here.
Eh, you were miserable this morning! We got bad reviews, terrible ratings, the sponsors are furious...
No, I was happy, but I just didn't realize I was happy.
Do you realize what a thread we're all hanging by?
Mickey, you're off the hook. You should be celebrating.
Mickey, you're off the hook. You should be celebrating.
Can you understand how meaningless everything is? Everything! I'm talking about nnnn--our lives, the show...the whole world, it's meaningless.

Yeah...but you're not dying!
Yeah...but you're not dying!
No, I'm not dying now, but, but you know, when I ran out of the hospital, I, I was so thrilled because they told me I was going to be all right. And I'm running down the street, and suddenly I stop, 'cause it hit me, all right, so, you know, I'm not going to go today. I'm okay. I'm not going to go
You're just realizing this now?
Well, I don't realize it now, I know it all the time, but, but I managed to stick it in the back of my mind...
Yeah. What?
Can I tell you something? Can I tell you a secret?
Can I tell you something? Can I tell you a secret?
Yes, please.
Yes, please.
A week ago, I bought a rifle.

Tch, well, you know, eventually it, it is going to happen to all of us.
Yes, but doesn't that ruin everything for you? That makes everything...

I know, I know, and your hamster.
I know, I know, and your hamster.

Listen, kid, I think you snapped your cap.
Maybe you need a few weeks in Bermuda, or something. Or go to a whorehouse! No?
I can't stay on this show. I gotta get some answers. Otherwise I'm telling you, I'm going to do something drastic.
Aah... Hey, have you tried Holly and her friend's shrimp puffs?
I think they're fantastic.

Really?
Really?
Yeah. I-I don't know what's wrong with him. He's just...kind of distant and difficult.
Yeah. I-I don't know what's wrong with him. He's just...kind of distant and difficult.
Oh...
Oh...
I've been trying to talk to him about it. He says everything's fine, but I don't know. Automatically, you know, I leap to the worst conclusions.

Like what?
I mean, I don't know, he's seeing someone else or something, but...
Oh, no! I mean, everyone thinks things like that.
What do--? You're being ridiculous.
You are, Holly. Stop it.
Oh, will you stop attacking Hannah?!
Oh, now--

Well, then a third opinion.
I'm so humiliated. I don't know what to say. I mean--
Could you have ruined yourself somehow?

You know, where I-I-I would get implanted from a-a donor.
You know, where I-I-I would get implanted from a-a donor.

Hannah and I...can't have any children. Now I-I-I don't want to get into whose fault it-- It's my fault that we can't and- and-and the details are too embarrassing to--
W-w-we-we've decided after a lot of discussion that we-we'd try with artificial insemination.
Um, I-I didn't really want to, you know, go to a sperm bank or something, have some anonymous donor. I-I just, you know, I-I-I wouldn't want that.
Right. We felt that if we were gonna do it, that we would like somebody who we knew and who we liked and who was warm and bright and...
Hey!
...from Mavis, also.
Here, Mom. Drink this. You know, you're awful. You probably were flirting.
No! I like to joke around and have fun, and he gets angry because I get the attention. He's gotten sourer as he's gotten older, and I've tried to stay young...at heart.

Th-th-they, they wanted me for a screen test.
Yeah, I know, Mom. NORMA But I, I knew that he'd get up there and he'd flounder around with his expensive haircuts and hairdos and clothes. He's all show! Now how can you act when there's nothing inside to come out?!
I just had a lot of luck...from my first show, you know? I've always thought Lee was the one destined for great things.
Yes, she's lovely, but she doesn't have your spark. She knows it. She worships you. She wouldn't dare get up there on the stage.
Yes, she's lovely, but she doesn't have your spark. She knows it. She worships you. She wouldn't dare get up there on the stage.
Now, Holly's not shy.
No, Holly's game for anything. Holly takes after me.
True.
True.
I'd have been a great dope addict.
What? You're kidding!
No, no, we decided!
Perfect!
Mmm...I mean, we love to cook for our friends, so we thought until an acting job comes through, we could just make some extra money, you know, doing a few private parties.
Get outta here. Could I speak to you privately?
Oh, sure.
Hannah, I have to borrow some more money. Don't get upset.
Mmm, I never get upset over that. Mmm?
Mmm, I never get upset over that. Mmm?
This is the last time, I promise. And I'm keeping strict accounts.
Holly, please. Don't insult me.
Someday, I'll pay it all back.
Someday, I'll pay it all back.
I know. H-how much do you need?
I know. H-how much do you need?
Two thousand dollars.
Uh-huh.
Hannah, I know it's a lot, but my friend April and I, we have this catering idea I think's going to be great.
You admit that we're great cooks, right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, in order to get started, there's just a few things I have to buy... and some old debts I have outstanding.
Well, in order to get started, there's just a few things I have to buy... and some old debts I have outstanding.
Will you just tell me one thing?

Okay.
Okay.
Are we talking about cocaine again?
Are we talking about cocaine again?
I swear. I swear. We've already got some requests to do a few dinner parties.
Ohh?
Uh-oh.
Doesn't she look great in that new dress?
Yeah.
Don't you think she does?
She really does, though.
Maybe when she's eighty, she'll stop straightening her garter belt when there's a guy around.
I should get a garter belt.
Frederick didn't come with her.
When does Frederick ever come with her?
When does Frederick ever come with her?
Tch. He's such an angry...he's such a depressive. I thought she was moving out!

Oh, perfect! He reminds me of Ichabod Crane. His Adam's apple keeps jumping up and down whenever he gets excited. HANNAH Listen. He's a lot better than your ex-husband. He's got a good job. Would you light those, please? He's-he's-he's not a dope addict or anything.
Not this Thanksgiving, you know.
Here. Be careful with those.
Here. Be careful with those.
Maybe at Christmas, New Year's. If not this New Year's, maybe next New Year's.
Ouch!
Oh!
You know, I just want to look so good, but I don't want to seem, you know, like I'm overdressed. You know what I'm saying? HANNAH Oh, no, not at all.
Well, how about this?
Well, how about this?
Well, I, I really like that. I think that's a pretty color on you.
Well, I, I really like that. I think that's a pretty color on you.
Oh, yeah.

Oh-oh. HOLLY ...and his wife's, uh, in and out of institutions. She's schizophrenic.
Sometimes she's terrific...
Oooo.

You found all this, all this out on one date?
Well, I think he was dying to open up. It's so sad. Now...what should I wear to my audition?
I've got a singing audition for a Broadway musical. Of course, I'll never get it.
Singing?
Singing?
Yeah, can you believe it?

Well, you think everybody in m- musicals sings so well?
No! No, I, eh, it's just that they sing.
Ohh!
You know.
You know.
I know, no-- I know.
I know, no-- I know.
I mean, y-you know, don't say it that way, you know, because my confidence is not my strong point, I--
I mean, y-you know, don't say it that way, you know, because my confidence is not my strong point, I--
No, I'm sorry. No, I didn't mean that. No, I didn't mean that.
Uh, you know, I think I can fake my way through a song.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Easily.
W-why? You don't think it's realistic?
No, I didn't, I, that's no. No, I- I-I, no, I-I just... hate to see you put yourself in a position where, where you get hurt, you know. You know, you know how you take...
No, I didn't, I, that's no. No, I- I-I, no, I-I just... hate to see you put yourself in a position where, where you get hurt, you know. You know, you know how you take...

Yeah. Well, maybe I'll get it.
Yeah. Well, maybe I'll get it.
I hope.
Boy, you really know how to cut me down.
What? You don't, don't be so sensitive. Can't I say anything?
What? You don't, don't be so sensitive. Can't I say anything?
Tch, well, I sing! For Chrissake, Hannah, you heard me sing!
Nobody but you can do that to me. I don't know why.
Look, everything's going your way.
Hey, hi!
Well, I just came from an audition...
Awwww...
So what's new?
Boy--
They said I was too offbeat looking, whatever the hell that means.
They said I was too offbeat looking, whatever the hell that means.
Oh, what do they know?
Oh, gosh.
You got it.
Oh, God...
Yeah, although it's put an end to the Stanislavski Catering Company. Which is why I have to speak to you. And... you're gonna get impatient, but...I have to borrow some more money.
Well, that...th-that's fine.
But what I decided to do is some writing. Yeah, I think I've had it with acting. You know, these meaningless auditions at cattle calls. And I can't handle another rejection. Now let's face it here. I gotta, you know, latch on to something in my life. You know--something with a future. I'm not sixteen anymore. It's just...crazy! I've got...an idea for a story.
Well, that-that's good. It just, uh...it just seems to me that-that six months or a year, if-if you spent it more productively...
Well-well, like what?
Well, I don't know. We'd uh, uh, um... Didn't Mom mention there was something...something at the Museum of Broadcasting?
Yeah, that's clerical.
Yeah, that's clerical.
No. She, didn't she say it was, um...she said it was in the publicity department. That-that can lead to other things.
Boy, I knew you'd be discouraging.
I'm not! I'm not! I'm trying to be helpful. A person doesn't just say one day, "Okay, now-now I'm finished as an actress. Now I'm a writer." I mean--
I'm not! I'm not! I'm trying to be helpful. A person doesn't just say one day, "Okay, now-now I'm finished as an actress. Now I'm a writer." I mean--
Yeah, you mean not at my age.
You treat me like a loser.
How?
How?
You never have any faith in my plans. You always undercut my enthusiasm.
Not so! No. I think I've been very supportive. I've...I try to give you honest, constructive advice.
Hmm!
Hmm!
I'm-I'm always happy to help you financially. I think I've gone out of my way to-to introduce you to interesting single men. There's nothing I would--
I'm-I'm always happy to help you financially. I think I've gone out of my way to-to introduce you to interesting single men. There's nothing I would--
Uh, losers! All losers!
Uh, losers! All losers!
You're too demanding.
You're too demanding.
You know, I could always tell what you thought of me by the type of men you fixed me up with!
You're crazy! That's not true.
Hey, Hannah, I know I'm mediocre.
What's the matter with you, Lee? Why are you so sensitive all of a sudden?
Look. Listen. Listen. You want to write? Write.
Look. Listen. Listen. You want to write? Write.
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
Write! Let's just not talk about it anymore.

Good.

Take...take a year. Take six months. Whatever you want. Who knows? Maybe you'll, maybe you'll be sitting with a good play.
Hey, what's the matter?
I'm real upset about what you wrote.
My script?
It's obviously based on Elliot and me.

Oh, so loosely.
Oh, so loosely.
No, not "Oh, so loosely"! Real specifically! Is that how you see us?
No, not "Oh, so loosely"! Real specifically! Is that how you see us?
Well--
Well--
Can I, can I not accept gestures and feelings from people? Do I, do I put people off?
Wow, I guess I hit a nerve.
You make it sound like, you know, I have no needs or something. You think I'm too self-sufficient?
You make it sound like, you know, I have no needs or something. You think I'm too self-sufficient?
Now, Hannah, that's not what I meant, you know. Uh, yeah, everybody relies on you for so much. "You're so giving. It's not a criticism. We love you. We're grateful."
Now, Hannah, that's not what I meant, you know. Uh, yeah, everybody relies on you for so much. "You're so giving. It's not a criticism. We love you. We're grateful."
You're grateful, but you resent me.
You're grateful, but you resent me.
Oh, wow! I don't want to have this conversation. I didn't do anything wrong.
Y-you mentioned to me yourself that you and Elliot were having some problems.
Yeah, we're having some problems, but problems that are my business...which I don't see how you could know about in such detail. How does Lee know about these things? How? They're private!
Well, why don't you share them with us?
I don't...I don't want to bother everyone.
I don't...I don't want to bother everyone.
That's the point. I'd like to be bothered.
That's the point. I'd like to be bothered.
I don't see how you could know about these things unless Elliot's been talking to you.
I don't see how you could know about these things unless Elliot's been talking to you.
No, he hasn't. If I offended you, I'm sorry.
Oh, why are you making those faces?
I can't hear you. I can't hear anything. I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm gonna lose hearing in my ear! I'm--

Sir, various drawings, done by Dr. Lechter, while in prison, stolen from the prison after his escape, have surfaced and are being sold at auction. Several large reserve bids have been placed on them. I have to ask if you've placed those bids.
Because?
Because?
Because if it was not you, then, perhaps it was Dr. Lechter, trying to reclaim his own property.

Large resources, Starling, which I prefer to devote elsewhere....
My encounter.
<u>Someone</u> offered three million dollars bounty on Dr. Lechter's head.
...sir...?
Isn't it funny? You can look on my face which you would grant me, is the most hideous sight you will see in what I hope is a long life. You can look at me. Which shows a Strength which <u>must</u> come from strong strong convictions. But you <u>shy</u> when I say the name of God.
Yes, then, you're saying that you <u>haven't</u> bid upon these drawings.
I have not, I would <u>not</u>. For life life goes on Starling. And, wait, wait, I wish to <u>talk</u> to you... I'm... One moment. I was <u>afflicted</u>, do you see, but my affliction was not in my meeting with your Dr. Lechter. I was <u>afflicted</u> before. Before. Do you see? In my arrogance. Do not Do not curse God when you are humiliated. Listen

Okay, okay, just don't everyone talk at once...First of all, little Jason has a learning disability...
Yeah, his lack of intelligence. Sorry, Wendy, but as learning disabilities go, stupidity is often overlooked.
Now what? What did I do this time?

Let's do it on the coats. It'll be excellent.
I have a little prepared speech I give when my suitor wants more than I'd like to give him.... Gee Blank, I had a nice....
Save the speeches for Malcom X. I just wanna get laid.
Save the speeches for Malcom X. I just wanna get laid.
You don't deserve my fucking speech!
If I got that money, I'd give it all to the poor. Every cent.
You're beautiful.
Oh, I have to hear this.
In my heart, Heather's still alive.
In my heart, Heather's still alive.
What are you talking about? She hated you! You hated her! What are you smiling at?
I don't know. This thing leaves a bad taste in my mouth.
Like last night, Veronica?
I'm sorry? I don't get it.
You did last night.
Take a break Veronica, sit down.
All right.
So what was the first week of Spring Vacation withdrawl like?
I don't know, it was okay, I guess.
Goddamn. Will somebody please tell me why I read this spy crap.
Because you're an idiot.
Because you're an idiot.
Oh yeah, that's it.
All right.
So what was the first day after Heather's suicide like?

Goddamn. Will somebody please tell me why I smoke these damn things?

Oh yeah, that's it.
Hey Veronica, how'd that Teenage Prevention T.V. Suicide thing go?
Color me educated. I learned high school happiness is for members only, Pauline Fleming wouldn't know reality if it lived in her uterus, and reality's name's Heather James. Also, J.D.'s a major creep.
Let me get it clear, Veronica. You want yourself a sweet homeboy for this T.V. show so you can show everybody what a loose, Martin Luther Cosby-lovng place Westerburg is.
Something like that. Will you do it?
Something like that. Will you do it?
Damn, you're a shrewd one. Shrewd.
Damn, you're a shrewd one. Shrewd.
I just want to show different kinds of people can get together and it doesn't have to be Vietnam. You don't get treated badly here do you?
I just want to show different kinds of people can get together and it doesn't have to be Vietnam. You don't get treated badly here do you?
I don't get treated at all, but hey, don't worry about it. I'll do your thing. It'll give my Mom a smile.
Things are going to change, Earl.
Uh-huh.
Veronica. Finally. Got a paper of Kurt Kelly's. I need you to forge a hot and horny but realistically low-key note in Kurt's handwriting and we'll slip it into Martha Dumptruck's lunch tray.
Shit, Heather. I don't have anything against Martha Dunnstock.
Shit, Heather. I don't have anything against Martha Dunnstock.
You don't have anything <u>for</u> her either. Come on, it'll be Very. The note'll give her shower nozzle masturbation material for weeks.

I'll think about it.
I'll think about it.
Don't think.
Sawyer. Guess what today is?
Ouch....the lunchtime poll. So what's the question?
Hey, this question wouldn't be that bizarro thing you were babbling about over the phone last......
Shut up, it is. I told Dennis if he gave me another topic that was political, I'd spew burrito chunks.
I was talking with someone!
Color me impressed. I thought you grew out of Betty Finn.
If you're going to openly be a bitch....
I'm sorry, it's just why can't we talk to different kinds of people?
I'm sorry, it's just why can't we talk to different kinds of people?
Fuck me gently with a chainsaw. Do I look like Mother Theresa? If I did, I probably wouldn't mind talking to the Geek Squad.
Doesn't it bother you that everyone in the school thinks you're a pirahna?
Like I give a shit. They all want me, as a friend or a fuck. I'm worshipped at Westerburg and I'm only a Junior.

Pretend you're a missionary saving a colony of cootie victims.
Pretend you're a missionary saving a colony of cootie victims.
Whatever. I don't believe this. We're going to a party at Remington University tonight and we're brushing up our conversation skills with the scum of the school.
Just imagine somebody like your quasi-fat, goody-good friend Betty Finn doing a Crest commercial. No one would buy Crest.
Don't tell me. Crest would be stained with loserness.
Don't tell me. Crest would be stained with loserness.
Yeah, and who wants that on their teeth?
You wanted to become a member of the most powerful clique in the school. If I wasn't already the head of it, I'd want the same thing.
I'm sorry? What are you oozing about?
I'm sorry? What are you oozing about?
That episode with the note back there was for all of us to enjoy, but you're determined to ruin my day.

We made a girl want to consider suicide. What a scream. What a jest.
We made a girl want to consider suicide. What a scream. What a jest.
Come on you jerk. You know you used to have a sense of humor.
Come on Heather. We want another look at today's lunch.
Geez, don't listen to them.
J.D.? You seem pretty amused. I thought you were giving up on high school guys.
Never say never.
Crap. So who's this Brad guy I've been set up with? Witty and urbane pre-lawyer or albino accountant?
Don't worry. David says he's very so he's very.
What's your damage? Brad says you're being a real cooze.
Heather, I feel awful, like I'm going to throw up. Can we jam, please?
Heather, I feel awful, like I'm going to throw up. Can we jam, please?
No. Hell no.
You stupid cunt!
You goddamn bitch!
You were nothing before you met me! You were playing Barbies with Betty Finn! You were a Brownie, you were a Bluebird, you were a Girl Scout Cookie! I got you into a Remington Party! What's my thanks? It's on the hallway carpet. I get paid in puke!
Lick it up, baby. Lick. It. Up.
Lick it up, baby. Lick. It. Up.
Monday morning, you're history. I'll tell everyone about tonight. Transfer to Washington. Transfer to Jefferson. No one at Westerburg's going to let you play their reindeer games.
Veronica. And Jesse James. Quelle surprise. Hear about Veronica's affection for regurgitation?
We both said a lot of things we didn't mean, last night.
We both said a lot of things we didn't mean, last night.

Is this turnout weak or what? I had <u>at least</u> seventy more people at my funeral.
Heather? Wha...

Oh God Veronica, my afterlife is s-o-o boring. If I have to sing "Kumbaya" one more time...
Oh God Veronica, my afterlife is s-o-o boring. If I have to sing "Kumbaya" one more time...
What are you doing here?!
What are you doing here?!
I made your favorite. Spaghetti. Lots of oregano.
Ku-urt, let's pa-arty.
Ku-urt, I ne-ed an orgasm.
Grow up, Heather. Bulimia's so '86.
Color me nauseous.
God, they won't expell him. They'll just suspend him for a week or something.
He used a real gun. They should throw his ass in jail.
Anyway, I can say never to high school. I've got David.
King David.
King David.
Maybe when you hit maturity you'll understand the diff between a Remington University man like David and a Westerburg boy like Ram "Wham-bam- thank-you-maam" Sweeney.
So tonight's the night. Are you two excited?
I'm giving Veronica her shot. Her first Remington Party. Blow it tonight girl and it's keggers with kids all next year.
Where did you get these?
Oh, I just had the <u>nicest</u> chat with Ms. Dumptruck. Got along famously! It's scary how everyone's got a story to tell....Would you care to see the canoeing shots?

Strength. Westerburg doesn't need mushy togetherness, it needs a leader. Heather Chandler was that leader but...
Strength. Westerburg doesn't need mushy togetherness, it needs a leader. Heather Chandler was that leader but...
But she couldn't handle it.
I think you can. In Catcher in the Rye Holden says his ideal job'd be making sure some kids don't fall off a cliff. He doesn't realize if you pay too much attention to the kids, you'll back off the cliff yourself.
Very very. The photographs?
Very very. The photographs?
Don't worry. I'll ask you to do me a favor. You'll get the negatives and everything back then.
TEENAGE SUICIDE; DON'T DO IT!
Some teenybopper rag says Big Fun wants to play a Prom. It could be Westerburg's if we can get everyone's John Hancock.
Yeah, she really wants to talk to you.
Okay, I'm going, I'm going. Jesus...
Maybe you should see a doctor.
Yeah, maybe.
Yeah, you know Holden Caulfield in the Catcher in the Rye wouldn't put up with their bogus nonsense.
Well, you better move Holden out of the way or he's going to get spewed.
Don't worry. We'll work something out.
Yes. Yes. We'll work something out. I swear to God. Won't we J.D.?...J.D.?
Guess who?
Heather.
Hi everyone, door was open. Veronica, you missed it! Pauline and Whitney James were up there doing there suicide rap when the cops come in and announce that Martha Dumptruck tried to buy the farm. She gave the ticket girl at the Colfax theatre a suicide note then bellyflopped in front of a car.
Is she dead?
Is she dead?
That's the punchline. She's still alive, in stable condition. Another case of a geek trying to imitate the popular people of the school and failing miserably. Is that pate?
I said I was sorry.
You are out of control. Heather and Kurt were a shock, but Martha Dumptruck, get crucial! She dialed suicide hotlines in her diapers.

You're not funny. Ouch!
What. A. Martyr. Understand; Martha couldn't take the heat so she got out of the kitchen. Just think what a better place the world would be if every nimrod followed her cue.
Just shut up and turn on the radio. Hot Probs is on.
Just shut up and turn on the radio. Hot Probs is on.
Oh shit, yeah.
Veronica! Color me stoked, girl. I've gotten <u>everyone</u> to sign this petition even the one who think BigFun are tuneless Eurofags. People love me! My God, you haven't signed!
People love you but I know you. Jennifer Forbes told me the petition she signed was to put a jacuzzi in the cafeteria. And Doug Hylton...

No.
No.
Jealous much?
Heather, why can't you just be a friend? Why are you such a MegaBitch?
Because I can be! The same fucking cheek, goddamnit! Why are you pulling my dick? Do you think, do you really think, if Betty Finn's fairy godmother made <u>her</u> Cool, she'd still act nice and hang with her dweebette friends? No way! Uh-Uh!
Veronica, you look like hell.
Yeah, I just got back.
What are you doing?
Heather, my love, there's a new sheriff in town.
What's your damage, Heather? You ruined my...
God, I'm so sure. Don't blame me, blame Heather. She told me to haul your ass into the caf pronto. Back me up, Heather.
God, aren't they fed yet? Do they even have Thanksgiving in Africa?
Oh sure, Pilgrims, Indians, tater tots; it's a real party continent.
God Veronica, drool much? His name's Jason Dean. He's in my American History.
Give me the clipboard.
No way, no day!
Give it up girl!
Watch it, Heather. You could actually be digesting food.
Yeah, where's your urge to purge?
That was seriously warped, Veronica.
Uh-huh.
Veronica. What are you doing tonight?
Mourning. Maybe watch some T.V. Why?

Please Veronica. Put Billy the Kid on hold tonight, I'll never forget it.
Shit.
So did you call people to tell them how to get to the studio tonight?
What were <u>you</u> trying to do? Sleep?
Suicide is a private thing.
You're giving your life away to become a goddamn statistic in U.S. Fucking A Today. That's got to be the least private thing I can think of.
But what about Heather and Ram and Kurt?

Probably just row on out to the middle of a lake. Bring along my sax, some tequila, and some Bach.
How very.
You going to pull a Big Gulp with that?
No, but if you're nice I'll let you buy me a Slurpee. You know your 7-11speak pretty well.

I saw the croquet set-up in the back. Up for a match?
That was my first game of Strip Croquet, you know. I thank you.
You're welcome. It's a lot more interesting than just flinging off your clothes and boning away on the neighbor's swing set.
Now blah-blah-blah is all I do. I use my grand I.Q. to figure out what gloss to wear and how to hit three keggers before curfew. Some genius.

But before that, I'd like to see Heather Chandler puke her guts out.
Trust me. She skips the Saturday morning trip to Grandma's even when she's not hungover.
Then let's just concoct ourselves a little hangover cure that'll induce her to spew red, white, and blue.
I'm a Pine-Sol man, myself.
Don't be a dick. That stuff'll kill her.
O-kay. We'll cook up some soup and put it in a Coke. Sick, eh? Now should it be Chicken-Noodle or Bean-with-Bacon?
Man Veronica, pull the plug on that shit. I say we go with Big Blue.
What are you <u>doing</u>? You just can't go.....Besides, she'd never drink anything that looks like that.
Okay we'll use this. She won't be able to tell what she's drinking.
Milk and orange juice. Hmmmm. Maybe we could cough a phlegm globber in it or something.
Yeah, great.
No luck? Well, milk and orange juice'll do quite nicely. Quite nicely.
Chick-en.
Chick-en.
You're not funny.

What is this shit?
I'm doing a favor for Heather. A double date. I tried to tell you at the funeral but you rode off.
So what? Don't smile like that, Jesus!
Our love is God. Let's get a Slurpee.
I don't get the point of me writing a suicide note when we'll just be shooting them with blanks.
Get crucial. We won't be using blanks this time.

Do you take German?

These are Ich Luge bullets. My grandfather snared a shitload of them in W.W. Two. They're like tranquilizers only they break the surface of the skin, enough to cause blood, but not any real harm.
So it looks like the person's been shot and killed when they're really just unconscious and bleeding.
First tell me this similarity is not incredible.
Incredible similarity.
Ram and I died the day we realized we could never reveal our forbidden love to an uncaring and ununderstanding world. The joy we shared in each other's arms was greater than any touchdown. Yet we were forced to live the lie of Sexist- Beer Guzzling-Jock-Asshole.
Exquisite, but I don't think ununderstanding is a word.
Exquisite, but I don't think ununderstanding is a word.
We don't want to make them out to be too secretly eloquent. Why would the Germans invent a bullet that doesn't kill people? I mean it <u>was</u> World War Two, not a school play.

Football season's over, Veronica. Kurt and Ram had nothing to offer the school but date-rapes and A.I.D.S. jokes.
Sure. Can we make an ice run before the funeral?
Your son's dead and you love him.
How do you think Mr. Kelly would react to a son with a limp wrist with a pulse?
Can't you see this is a special moment?

Our sins? What sins? If you put a Nazi in a concentration camp, does that make you a Nazi?

Wha-at? Come on, there's another T.V. in the kitchen. You know you used to have a sense of humor.
You're getting too cool for me, J.D. I don't know how to talk to you.
Our relationship's moving fast, I know, but I have real, real respect for you.
I'm going to make this Ms. Pauline thing work. Lines of communication between the cliques. You were a phase....
Phase my ass! You'll be <u>back</u>! I'm storming Normandy beaches and you're running in place with Pauline Fonda's airhead peacenik exercise program. Have to stay tough! You'll be back.
Catch a movie? Miniature Golf?
I was thinking more along the lines of slitting Heather Duke's wrists open and making it look like a suicide.

It's over, J.D. Over!
I don't get it! You were wrong! I was right! Strength, damnit! Come back!
Get off my bed, you sick psycho! You think you're a rebel! You're not a rebel! You're a sick psycho! Do you think you're a rebel? Do you think you're a rebel? I wanna know!

I think I know Heather a bit better than you, okay? If she was going to slash her wrists, the knife would be absolutely spotless.
Tomorrow someone else will move into her place. That person could be me. Ha, there's only one of us who knows Heather's handwriting and if you think I'm doing another suicide note.
You don't get it, do you? Society nods its head at any horror the American teenager can think to bring upon itself. We don't need gloves and does anyone really care about exact handwriting?
If you'll excuse me......
No-o!

Okay, okay. I knew that. I knew that. Put your hands on your head.
You didn't say Simon Says.
It's all over, J.D. Help me to stop it.
You want to wipe the slate clean as much as I do. Okay, so maybe I am killing everyone in the school because nobody loves me. You have a purpose though! Remember? Let's face it, the only place different social types can genuinely get along with each other is in heaven.
How do you turn the fucker off?
You're not listening. People are going to look at the ashes of Westerburg and say there's a school that self-destructed not because society didn't care, but because that school <u>was</u> society. Is that deep or what? I'll let you put it in your diary, babe. Free of charge.

May<u>be</u>. There's kind of a dark horse now in the running.
You two....
Great pate, but I'm going to have to motor if I want to be ready for the party tonight.
Terrible thing. So will we get to meet this dark horse prom contender?
May<u>be</u>.
You two....
Greate pate, but I'm going to have to motor if I want to be ready for the funeral tomorrow.
How was the funeral?
Superb.
Turn that back on!
This condescending junk makes suicide seem like a cool thing to do. Hey kids, make your parents and teachers feel like shit! Get the respect in death you'll never get in life.
Everybody cares for youth but nobody cares about Joey Blow. When that news reporter gets home he'll scream at his son for not mowing the lawn in the right pattern.

Dear Veronica, Heather was your soulmate.....Share.
Heather was cool, but cruel. The good looks and bad manners gave her power, but it could not give her happiness.
Everyone take their places on the stage! Isn't this thrilling?!
But Ms. Fleming, it's just not right.
But Ms. Fleming, it's just not right.
What, the wine? I realize you're all under 21, but it seemed like such a perfect touch. Could we get some more light up here?

It rained everyday of my Maui vacation, but hey, I didn't kill myself. I'm Whitney James, Commentary.
I got a confession to make. My name used to be Heather, too.
But my name's not...
But my name's not...
People just don't take the name Heather seriously. They should, shouldn't they?
I'm so sorry. I was led to believe there were going to be different kinds of social and psychological types at this gathering.
Oh, I was scared of the same thing, Heather. The minute you try to deal with the actual teenagers who have contemplated suicide you're stepping into quicksand. Quicksand filled with bad complexions, bad grades, bad parents, bad drugs, and all sorts of doody nobody wants to hear let alone bend down to clean up.
The world wants winners, I guess. Not people stained with loserness.
Stained with loserness. Oh, I like it. Can I use that. It'd be dynamite on interoffice memoranda.

I had a nasty foreboding feeling at first, but now I realise my crime was too frightful for an ordinary lecture.
From now on, you're sleeping in the house, where we can keep an eye on you.
If you think for one minute that your father and I will tolerate this sort of behaviour, you've got another thing coming! You're only 14!!! You're a child! What on earth's the matter with you, Yvonne? You know what can happen with boys . . . Don't you have any self-respect?

Well that's not necessarily a bad thing is it?

Trevor things like this happen to people who experience temporary memory loss. Everybody does things they regret.

The boss won't notice me doing a bad job because I'm not. Even if the boss thought I was slacking I'd know right away.
Yeah, how's that?
Yeah, how's that?
I have my connections

Gwen.
GWEN?
I crap you not. She was all over me yesterday in the break room. And she was a total machine last night too.

You were supposed to have a date with Gwen last night? GWEN DEARDON? The supervisor?
You were supposed to have a date with Gwen last night? GWEN DEARDON? The supervisor?
Serious as a heart attack my friend. I think she literally fucked me brains out.
Hey if you're not doing anything I'd like to buy you a beer after work. Be just like old times.
What's the occasion?
What's the occasion?
I quit. Today's my last day.
I've got a better offer. More time off. A sort of career shift, more in the engineering line of work.
How much time off?
How much time off?
As much as he feels like. Its a much more pleasurable line of work.
So you're just packing it up just like that?
Almost that fast. I got a few loose ends to tie up first. Came into a shitload of money recently. I've always wanted to go to take a trip. We're just gonna walk into the airport and decide right then and there.

Yeah? You and who else?

Someone special.
Bret... what the fuck...?
Tonight was supposed to be the night, Trevor. Remember? I couldn't believe you went through five dart games and didn't even joke about it.

Bret. What the hell is going on?
Bret. What the hell is going on?
We were gonna be millionaires you said. Nobody'd suspect a thing. I had never even met her. No connection. Then you went and had that fucking car accident.

Bret you are making no sense whatsoever.
Bret you are making no sense whatsoever.
I followed her Trevor. I got to know her life. And what a boring one it was. Six a.m. gym, nine a.m. trendy coffee shop, noon bookstore, one soap operas, four o'clock news, five wait for Trevor to come home. And wait and wait and wait. Nine o'clock get ready for bed.
Hello I'm Dr...
Ambrose. I know.
Ambrose. I know.
Have we met?
Have we met?
I've been in here before.
I've been in here before.
Take no offense Trevor. I see many patients a day and have an awful memory.
Why don't you relax for the next couple of hours? Barring any relapses you should be able to go home after that.
Where's Allison?
Who's Allison?
Allison Dormere. Your intern.
What did you just say?
I said she's been missing for-
I said she's been missing for-
No. No you said HER BODY's been missing.
No. No you said HER BODY's been missing.
What's the difference?
Last time anybody saw this woman she was alive. You seem to certain she's dead.
I saw her drowning inside the car, detective.
You could say that.
Zero's a number right?
Zero's a number right?
As in one minus one equals zero yes. Where are you going with this?
As in one minus one equals zero yes. Where are you going with this?
How many zeros was your wife worth?
Now I want you to tell me what you remember happening- in your own words- exactly the way you told Detective Lange. But this time I want you to make one small adjustment.
What's that?
Come on speak up, Gooding, I'm trying to run a business here. I can't have people flipping out in the break room when they should be slaving away at their desks.
Sorry I just kind of... spaced for a second there.
Get back here, junior bean counter. This is your supervisor speaking.
Please, Gwen. You're- you're all over me.
Please, Gwen. You're- you're all over me.
How do you think you got this job, cock? Mmm. I'm still tingling all over from our little midnight swim.
What's wrong, Trev?
Nothing, look. Gwen I really like you-
Nothing, look. Gwen I really like you-
And it shows. Least it did last night at the quarry. In a big way.
YOU'RE giving ME a speeding ticket? Mr. Mario Andretti himself?
Gwen, my wife's dead.
Gwen, my wife's dead.
Oh I see. That again. Trevor? I realize it must be hard. But Christ how long does it take someone to move on?
That was cold...
No, making another woman compete with someone who's been dead eight months. That's cold.
Good boy. Where's is it?
What?
What?
Our little toy. You usually have it up and running by now.

You win! Okay pull over.
But... I thought...
But... I thought...
If what I've heard is true this could be the last time for a long long time. Besides we've got a whole seven minutes before the next one. Clock's ticking. Tick-tock...
What isn't wrong? Why are you doing this anyway?
I'm... I'm doing a very special thing here. And you can't even ... respond?
Just concentrate on the task at hand please. Listen to me. You should be giving ME this lecture.
You've been cheating on me haven't you?
You've been cheating on me haven't you?
Yes I had a quickie with the neighbor during your last contraction.
Yes I had a quickie with the neighbor during your last contraction.
Roughly two thirds of married men who cheat start during the eighth month of their wives' first pregnancy.
Oh my God. It's coming out.
What?
What?
THE BABY IS COMING OUT! I CAN FEEL IT! SONOFABITCH IT HURTS!! AAAGGGGHHH!!!
OH MY GOD TREVOR! It hurts!! oh my God, Oh my God. Trevor, It's coming out.
This isn't happening.
How does feel to be Mr. Kirsty Hughes for a whole year.
In a word? Lucrative.

Never to put you in my will.

Really? Why?
But you had more wisdom than to listen to a false prophet
There is no wisdom, no insight, no plan
And besides, I thought, to hell with it... it's okay if you only married me for my money.
Really, why's that?
Really, why's that?
I only married you for your body.
Happy Anniversary, Mrs. Gooding.
For me? Trevor! How romantic! Come here, you.
Kirsty... Kirsty?
It's okay it was just a nightmare that's all.
You're alive...
Yes. Now go back to sleep. You're driving the rest of the way to gramma's remember?
Trevor I've decided we have got to agree on a name before we reach my mother's. This poor kid's going to be starting preschool as student x if we don't make up our minds. So, I've been thinking, what about Daisy?
It's perfect.
Thanks for coming down Mr. Gooding. Has your head healed okay by now?
Where's my wife?
Where's my wife?
Okay then. Here's the scoop.
What evidence?
For one thing there were no skid marks on that bridge, the tires were all intact, from what we could tell, nothing wrong internally with the vehicle either. Like the car had been driven off the bridge intentionally.

It should all in the report. I told you guys everything. She was giving birth in the fucking car. She grabbed the wheel and I lost control.

I did read that, yes. What hospital were you going to? I mean the Lodovico Street Bridge isn't exactly on the way to Mercy General.
Sorry I'm in your seat aren't I?
No please make yourself at home.
I thought you loved games.
I'll just stay out of this conversation until you come out and tell me why you've disrupted me at work.

You and your wife were playing a game shortly before you got into that car accident weren't you?

Where is she? Where is my wife?
Sorry to take up your time like that Trevor. Don't work too hard. Oh, before I forget. I talked your neighbor out of pressing charges.
What?
What?
The whackjob in the black lipstick who lives down the hall? She wanted you arrested for harassment. I told her to chill out and smoke a joint. I'd look the other way as long as she did you know?

Thanks.
Thanks.
We're all here for you Trevor.
Morgue...?
That's right Trevor. The timing was impeccable wasn't it? It's been eight months two weeks and three days but we finally found the body. Just need you to ID it for us.
Look Larry I know you never thought too much of me. And I know this all sounds a little fucked up.
A little? Try unbelievably.
A little? Try unbelievably.
I swear these guys are like playing mindgames with me. I think they got a hold of my e-mail address at work too.
Trevor barring the more outrageous aspects of your claim you are not the only widower the police have questioned when foul play is suspected.
Hey ninety five point three percent of all murders are committed by either a spouse, a direct relative or a close friend that's common knowledge. But this wasn't murder it was an accident-

And as far as hiding a body goes? I find it hard to believe even the dirtiest of cops would keep a victim's remains hidden simply to get someone to confess. It's absolutely preposterous. Now I'm not saying I don't believe you, I'm....ambiguous. There's quite alot of money behind all this.

How much do I stand to inherit if Kirsty is presumed dead?
What happens if I'm convicted of Kirsty's murder?
Well they'd have to prove it in a court of law for one thing-
Please Larry. Pretend you like me and humor me.
Seeing you were her sole benefactor, and I'm the executive of the will, Kirsty's entire estate would have to be donated to the city.

Pardon my glibness Trevor but you sound like a raving lunatic. The next time you seek counsel it should be of the psychiatric type. You're obviously on the verge of some nervous collapse.

Thanks for your concern Larry. And fuck you too.
Least let me finish will ya? Got one puff left.
I don't work here.
I don't work here.
Music to my ears.
Hey buddy!
... but I'm starting to think I was... I was going to...
... but I'm starting to think I was... I was going to...
Hey buddy!
What do you want?!
Who the hell are you talking to?
Do you know where you are?
Ambulance.
Ambulance.
We're just gonna take some blood here.
Okay how many fingers am I holding up?
Two.
Two.
Can you follow them?
You mean... when the car went off the bridge?
Wow you are out of it.
Poor Trevor.
This game is over do you hear me?
This game is over do you hear me?
I hear everything. And soon you will know everything. More than you ever wanted I can guarantee that. But I want you to think for a minute first. Think about all you've seen. All the clues you've been given.
How is our little student doing? Has he learned his lesson yet?
I don't know who you are or what you want. I just want to know what's under that sheet...
I don't know who you are or what you want. I just want to know what's under that sheet...
Use your mind for something other than numbers dear Trevor. Think about people for a change. People other than yourself. Like the women you slept with behind your wife's back. You were always so confident you had covered your tracks. Always confident your wife actually believed your fervent denials? Part of you must have known she would find out.
What's under that sheet...?
You probably don't remember the night we played. Your first year as husband and wife.
I don't know what I'm doing here. I'm not even Catholic. I just had to tell somebody. It's like, ever since my wife died I don't know what I've actually done or what I've imagined. But I do know if one tenth of what's happening to me is reality... I've done some really awful things in my life. Things that I've... I guess I've
What things do you think you've done?
What things do you think you've done?
Wow. Let's see. So many sins so little time. For starters I was responsible for the death my wife who by the way was carrying my unborn child. That was so I could collect her eight million dollar estate. I think I killed several women I was having mindless sex with behind her back.
But I saw these women. I saw their mutilated bodies. I saw their ghosts. I just know it happened I can feel it...
All you've got is the here and the now Trevor. That's all anyone really has. Maybe this will make things easier to understand. A man goes to sleep every night and has recurring dream that he's a butterfly. In time he begins to wonder if he might actually be a butterfly who dreams he's a man. And at the end of the day does

A man goes to sleep every night and has recurring dream that he's a butterfly. In time he begins to wonder if he might actually be a butterfly who dreams he's a man. And at the end of the day does
But that's what I need. To be sure... to be absolutely sure...
But that's what I need. To be sure... to be absolutely sure...
Shh. It's okay son. There is but one truth. One thing you can be absolutely sure of. And that thing is this:
Dreams?
I was going to say dimensions. But I guess technically they are dreams.
I was going to say dimensions. But I guess technically they are dreams.
You should always listen to your subconscious. It's trying to tell you something about your waking life.
Trevor your body has been completely healed. All the nerve endings have repaired themselves. If there is any pain in your head it's... in your head.
Jeez it's getting awful crowded in there.
My teacher told me once there's a puncture point on your body that can lock your soul within it, even after you're dead. So that when you die you're trapped inside your body, watching it corrode for all eternity.
Look, whatever your Marharagi, told you, forget. You've got to get this fuckin pain to stop.
It was an analogy. Your soul is locked up inside you. You need to free it Trevor. You've blocked it from the healing process. That's what we need to do now. Heal your soul. And to do that I you have to give in utterly and without any hesitation or doubt. Do you know what I mean by giving in? It's about trust. Do
I don't even know what's real and what isn't how can I trust anyone?
I don't even know what's real and what isn't how can I trust anyone?
You can trust me. Your wife is dead and you need to move past that. And the only way to move past something completely is to go straight through it, not around it. Surrender yourself to your wife's death. Let it chew you up and spit you back out on the other side. It's the only way you can become whole again.
Are you ready?
I surrender...
Wait... what the hell is this...
Surrender yourself... surrender yourself...
... knock on my door, I'm a total insomniac.
No, thanks I've got a... a date tonight-
-Tawny.
Whew. You bounce right back don't you?
Whew. You bounce right back don't you?
What do you mean?
Last week...
The car accident? Any of this ringing a bell?
It's not that kind of date.
Hey even if it is more power to ya. Alrighty then. Have a good time.
Hey. Can I borrow something?
Uh... sure, Tawny... what?
Uh... sure, Tawny... what?
You.
Tawny? What's- what are you doing?
YOU!
You okay?
I'm, uh, not sure... Feeling kind of weird actually.
I'm, uh, not sure... Feeling kind of weird actually.
Really?
I'm kinda feeling nuts myself!
I've never said this to a woman before but can't we talk a little bit before grabbing at each other?
I've never said this to a woman before but can't we talk a little bit before grabbing at each other?
God. Sometimes you can be such an animal. Other times you are the ultimate tease...
Wow. That's good. Lots of capers, huh?
For starters. It's also got fennel, asparagus, olives, some more of mother nature's aphrodisiacs... Back in college, me and my roommates used to call it hard- on stew.
If you ever smelled this coming from our dorm room, you knew one of us was in there getting laid.
You must have been very proud of yourselves...
You must have been very proud of yourselves...
It's getting hot in here.
Tawny I think I'm going to be sick.
Well now there's a compliment.
Whoa, I have serious space issues, dude. What do you want?

WHAT?!
And you pulled people out? You're... a hero.
Nah, I fucked it up. I was tryin' to impress this kid, don't ask me why. I was gonna rescue his old man, but I couldn't find the poor bastard. He musta blew up. I got the hell outta there. I didn't have the nerve to face the kid.

LaPlante!

Come on, John, don't be an asshole. I don't like heights.
I just wanna talk with you for a minute. Then you can jump. You can jump twice for all I care.
Talk from there. You can talk from there.
Talk from there. You can talk from there.
In private. They got cameras and alla that crap in there. Microphones.
That's for Ga... Ms. Gayley.

What am I, a goddamn postman? I'm way the fuck up here, I'm scared a heights, and you want me to deliver a letter? Put a stamp on it for Chrissake!
That's close enough. It's a confession. The truth. Jesus, I'm sorry, LaPlante. I had the shoe, you said you didn't want, publicity because of your legal problems.

You should go in. You're risking your life again...
You should go in. You're risking your life again...
I'm beginning to... be aware of that, John. Listen, I'm not gonna do nothing heroic here, you can trust me on that, buddy. Whaddaya say we just sit down for a while. I don't have no tricks, I'm not that smart. You could, like, rest up for the jump.
What have I done? I was dirt poor and useless... but I was honest.
Lighten up, John. You think <u>you</u> got problems for Chrissake?
You stole her purse! While you were saving her?
What's the big deal? You decided to pretend you were me. A little moment of weakness, right? So I sorta swiped her purse. I got feet of clay too, bUddy.

You got those people out of the plane, LaPlante, not me.
You <u>woulda</u> gone in there, you wouldn'ta thought twice... Trust me on that, that's the kinda guy you are. For a guy like me, it's a momentary loss of sanity. I wasn't thinking clearly.

And give a deposition to the jUdge.
And give a deposition to the jUdge.

Same with me, pretending I was you. An impulse. Why not? I had this shoe.
Same with me, pretending I was you. An impulse. Why not? I had this shoe.

"Anticipation of incarceration"?
He means prison, Mr. LaPlante.
He means prison, Mr. LaPlante.
I know what he means. I'm not a prison kinda guy, Miss O'Day. I'm a goddamn working man for Chrissake! Maybe I "augment" my income a little with some "business deals," maybe summa the guys I sell to are crooks, how would I know, I'm not an investigator. You can't make it on a wage no more, not in this country.

I think you should visit your son. And try and get your boss to write a note about your performance on the job. You need to create the impression of a responsible, decent citizen with familial responsibilities who happened to slip up once.
Uh, I know you're having financial difficulties, Mister LaPlante, but I wonder if... I mean, the money I loaned you...
Some of it. Right here. I got some of it. I'll get the rest as soon as I can.
"The Angel of Flight 104!" You're telling me you're the A...?

Mister LaPlante, I really want to help you, but crazy stories are only going to make it worse. The D.A. is asking your bail be set at twenty-five thousand dollars because you were arrested again while you were out on bail...

Well, as you like to point out, Mister LaPlante, I'm relatively inexperienced. My naivete may have worked to your benefit in this instance.
Listen, now that I owe you twenty-five hundred bucks plus, how about loaning me twenty for cab fare?
So you can call me "naive," Mister LaPlante.

In all that smoke and fire, John had a moment of weakness. He'd been down and out, destitute, living in his car. It was just an impulse, stealing my purse.
All this is off the record, Chucky, because if John Bubber lives, Mister LaPlante is going to give him his assurance that there will be no more "misbehavior" on his part. What's more he's going to apologize.
I'm going to apologize to Bubber?

Yes.
Yes.
...unworthy of the adoration. We all do.
Is she... serious? A half a million dollars? In my behalf?
You're a celebrity, John. People are going to want to please you... or use you... or both.
Uh, no. But I, uh, wonder if you could up support... support a program to help the needy and...
John, I'm sure she could support just about anything. I think I'll see you to your room. A sort of bodyguard. Make sure no harm comes to you.
Uh, if you could, just, uh, support, uh, a small airfield...
It's been sometime since, uh, I received any, uh, of that kind of, uh... attention. A couple of... years.

John, I know all about it.
John, I know all about it.

Did you get it? Jesus, did I say that?
Yeah, I got it. Sports training. You learn to follow the ball. How about you do a wrap-up from up here? I'll pan off that skyscraper over there, find you here, then reveal the drop.
What're we talking about? Reach out for what?
I told them how you were upset we didn't save the guy...
We're gonna wait here? The guy could be hours.

And sold it to Mister LaPlante, the fence, who's now trying to blackmail poor John.
He's gotta be a nut! He saves all those people and swipes a <u>purse</u>?
Because he was a <u>real</u> hero, Chucky. He was acting out of a deep instinctive decency, not out of some ego thing. He didn't expect the media to lionize him. He didn't expect a million dollar reward. He saved fifty-four people because something inside him, some fundamental love for his fellow man, made him rush into that plane when "good sense" told him otherwise.
It would make me feel like a human being instead of a cynical, hardbitten newswoman. Besides it wouldn't be a bad story, would it, "Newswoman Saves Suicide?"
Unprofessional.
Unprofessional.
You just can't bear the idea of good news.

She broke up with her boyfriend. Listen, babe, we needja back. You gotta follow up on the jumper, find the human interest in the grim, unending tale of woe that pours from the wounded heart of the heartless metropolis.
The story behind the story, the ugly scandal behind the falling millionaire, the dirt, you mean.

Would the station put me up at a good hotel...?
There's a lot of confusion around what went on last night, it's not clear...
You said all the passengers were accounted for...
You said all the passengers were accounted for...
Apparently the guy who pulled you out wasn't a passenger...
We're piecing together different accounts and...
A "mystery guy!" "Not a passenger." Who?
There could be problems with something like that Mister Wallace. What if...?
WHAT? THEY FOUND WHAT?
How'd it go?
He'll do it. You really-should have talked to him first.
He's right. It's unprofessional.
If you reach out, you could get pulled over yourself.
Saving people is not our job. It's as wrong to step in and save someone as it would be to push someone off.
You wouldn't push the guy, would you?
Ticket! What's going on?
She's flying to New York. She's been nominated for a Silver Mike...

A Silver Mike! You're covering us in glory!
Not bad. But if you gotta wear a cast, you oughtta feature it more it's parta the story. Network's taking everything we give 'em. They wanta feed off our six o'clock whether we find the mystery guy or not. We're very big nationally.
It's a wonderful piece. Emotional. I love it.

We're gonna feature Gale's cast more. The trick is gonna be keeping the upper hand on this piece. As long as we have Gale and there's no mystery guy, we're the center of the story. But if he shows up and somebody else gets him first or exclusive...

What about a reward for coming forward?
I thought they'd all go "It's him! It's him!" and hug the guy or something.
Relax, Wally. He had the shoe and the shoe checks out.

Does this mean I can stop worrying? Where'd we put him?
Does this mean I can stop worrying? Where'd we put him?
Drake Hotel, Penthouse Suite. Never stop worrying. I figure we'll do a sidebar on what it's like to go from sleeping in your car and collecting cans to sleeping in the poshest suite in town. Also Gale's onto something, digging into his background.
Upset! What's he upset about?
Said he's not an actor.
Said he's not an actor.
He's not <u>supposed</u> to be an actor, that's the whole point. He's a <u>real</u> <u>life</u> <u>hero</u>, all he has to do is <u>act</u> like a real life hero. That's the <u>beauty</u> of the <u>concept</u>, the whole <u>freshness</u> of it. Did she call him back?

She's talking to him now.
She's talking to him now.
We paid him a million dollars. You'd think he'd want to cooperate a little, help our ratings.
Whaddaya mean what do I wanna know? I wanna know everything. Who's this screwball LaPlante for Pete's sake, what the hell's he doing out there, auditioning for the priesthood? You're supposed to be on top of this, Gale, don't... "Quit!" You can't quit! It's unprofessional!
Quit? She wants to quit?
Quit? She wants to quit?
Listen, Gale, I know you're emotionally involved. Don't be emotionally involved, be professional. No, Gale, you are not a hardbitten, cynical hard-ass, you just think you are. You are a goddamn cream puff! Try and be a hard-ass!
She wants to quit?
She can't quit.
Gale shoulda aired that bit first, she's the one who found this clown LaPlante! She let Channel Eight get a beat on us.
Listen, Deak, what if Bubber <u>has</u> got something to hide? What if he's the wrong guy, not really the hero...?

Helluva story!
Helluva story!
No, Deak, not a great story. We backed this guy, he's our boy! We gave him a vote of confidence, we gave him a million dollars.
It's not unthinkable.
What?
What?
The Presidency. The public loves him.
The Presidency. The public loves him.
For ten more minutes they love him, Wally. I'm sick of him and I'm always about ten minutes ahead of the public.
He lost a shoe!
Who lost a shoe? Wash your hands.
Who lost a shoe? Wash your hands.
The "unknown hero." They found his shoe right beside the plane crash.
My father didn't have his shoes on when he... when he came here.
You were in bed. Weren't you?
You were in bed. Weren't you?
I... I saw him out the window.
My God! It... it <u>is</u> him!
Wh-why's he... why's he up there, mom?
If I gave you the impression I hated him I didn't mean to. I... I hate the way he <u>behaves</u>... he's selfish and self-centered and cynical...
What's "cynical"?
What's "cynical"?
It's when you say, "Everybody else cheats why shouldn't I?" But I don't -- I don't <u>hate</u> -- him. I... loved him once, Joey. Very much. I just got... tired. Maybe it wasn't all his fault. He... What's happening? Oh, my God...
Oh my God! Bernie!
Dad!
Hi, Chief. You like the suicide?
Never reach out!
Never reach out!
Hello, Mister Wallace.
I didn't say I thought we should have saved him..
You didn't?
