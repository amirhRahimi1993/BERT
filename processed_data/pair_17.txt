I know what this is...I picked you up when I was drunk and you probably thought I'm just fucked up enough to fall for this. But the thing is I know what I'm doing when I drink. I just usually don't care. Right now, I do though. And I want you out. Now.
It's December 25th, 1993 today.
It's December 25th, 1993 today.
No, it's not. [Beat] It's December 25th, 2004.
I'm telling you I don't care what time you think you're in. You're not William Starks. [Beat] I don't believe in many things, but I believe in death. And it doesn't give back what it takes. So whoever you are...I did a nice thing, you've made me regret it enough already, so please, just leave.
I'll leave. But look at me. Look at my face, Jackie. I'm not lying. I met you and your mother. I told you then that I'd lost my memory. [Beat] There was no one for miles around so I know you know there's no way I could have known that from a pair of dog tags you had lying around.
I'll leave. But look at me. Look at my face, Jackie. I'm not lying. I met you and your mother. I told you then that I'd lost my memory. [Beat] There was no one for miles around so I know you know there's no way I could have known that from a pair of dog tags you had lying around.
Please...
The Jacket. That's what they call it, right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
It was banned, you know... and it led to an investigation of Dr. Becker's mistreatment of some of his patients. That's when they found out how badly he was drugging his patients...
But no one knew until after...
After I...
[Beat] You bled to death.
What?
What?
I don't know how you got the cut to your head, but you died bleeding from it.
Do you really believe me?
I don't know. [Beat] I thought I was crazy after you left that day. I died. I still think I could be crazy. But then I replayed that night in my head -- the parts of it I could remember -- and it was like...I don't care if I was, or am. I haven't felt that way in a room with someone my whole
[Softly] I want to trust you. Should I trust you?
Yes.
Yes.
Then we need to figure out what happened to you. It's the only thing we can do.
Then we need to figure out what happened to you. It's the only thing we can do.
I know.
I know.
Alpine Grove still exists. I looked it up on the net. We should go there and see if there's still anyone around who might have known what happened to you.
Alpine Grove still exists. I looked it up on the net. We should go there and see if there's still anyone around who might have known what happened to you.
If they don't take me out before then. [As an afterthought] What's the net?
I didn't kill Officer Harrison.
I know.
I know.
How? Did they figure it out after I died?
How? Did they figure it out after I died?
No. They never figured it out. I did. Most murderers don't stop to help a drunk woman and her little girl on the side of the road. Not without hurting them.
I don't believe a thing she just said.
Me neither. Who was the boy she was talking about, Eugene?
Me neither. Who was the boy she was talking about, Eugene?
I have no idea.
I have no idea.
You think Lorenson kills you?
You think Lorenson kills you?
Maybe. I don't know. Seems more likely Becker does, but at the very least she knows how I died.
Maybe. I don't know. Seems more likely Becker does, but at the very least she knows how I died.
Let's see if they have an address for Becker. I also want to figure out more about the kid you helped her with.
Let's see if they have an address for Becker. I also want to figure out more about the kid you helped her with.
Why?
Why?
Because that's the part I believe is true. You probably did help her somehow with the boy and Eugene's name did come up over and over again on the abstracts I pulled.
How long do we have?
I don't know.
I don't know.
They told me Becker's in Shelbourne now. I looked him up and he was listed.
What about Captain Medley? He never told them what happened to you over there. His testimony...that coward wanted them to think you were crazy.
I know. It was perfect. [Beat] Erase my sanity and you erase anything I'll ever say.
Of course it makes me mad. It makes me more than mad. Just like remembering the face of the man who killed that officer and knowing nothing more about him. But what's it gonna do for me to find them now? I can't fix everything in three days.
You've got to get yourself out of that place. They're going to kill you if you don't.
You've got to get yourself out of that place. They're going to kill you if you don't.
I might not be able to.
I might not be able to.
It's not a prison, it's a hospital. There's got to be some way out of there and you've got to find it...
Me, too.
Here, drink this. I'll get the heat going.
You're sure?
Yeah. I called the number yesterday to make sure. Thomas Becker, retired M.D.
They're not here.
They're not.
They're not.
[Beat, lost] No.
What? What are you thinking?
There're no cars on this street.
I don't know. Maybe that's because this whole thing is a dream. How can you have a street with no cars on it?
I don't know. But this isn't a dream. I'm real, and so is where we are.
I don't know. But this isn't a dream. I'm real, and so is where we are.
Then why isn't there anyone around?
Then why isn't there anyone around?
[Beat] I don't know.
Of course he will. [Beat] What day of the week is it?
It's Sunday.
They've got lives to be grateful for.
William, you're not making sense.
William, you're not making sense.
[Beat] They're at Church. And I bet that's where Becker is.
That's all you got from him? That bastard helped take your life away from you.
No, he didn't.
No, he didn't.
What? How can you say that? He's the one that put you in that goddamn medieval...Jacket. He's probably the one who killed you.
If everything hadn't happened the way it has, then I wouldn't be here right now, sitting in a car with you, touching your face.
Why are you saying that? [Beat] We don't have long, do we?
Where are we going?
To the hospital.
What's happening to me? Why am I getting so much weaker?
Because your body can only take so much of what they're putting you through.
Lorenson's the only one that could let me out of there. I need something to persuade her that I was there. Get me something to take to her.
Ok. Ssh. Rest.
What?
When we first met, when you were 7, where was the house you lived in with your mother? Do you remember your address?
When we first met, when you were 7, where was the house you lived in with your mother? Do you remember your address?
112 Orchard Way. [Realizing, in a whisper] You're not coming back, are you?
You gotta stop thinking like that.
Then, where are you going?
Then, where are you going?
Nowhere. [Beat] I just think I'm gonna be sick.
I've been ok.
Good. How's your mom?
Good. How's your mom?
Ok, I guess.
[Beat] You be good to yourself, Jackie.
Ok.
I think so.
You're bleeding pretty bad there.
It's ok. It's ok. Relax. It's just a cut. We can get it fixed. But we need to get you to the hospital now. How'd you get that?
I fell down. [Beat] But I'm alive.
How you doin'?
I'm doing fine.
Just a little, when we were looking up information about William's father. How did he help?
It's complicated, but [looking at Starks] in a way, your father let me know how I'd get through to him.
It's complicated, but [looking at Starks] in a way, your father let me know how I'd get through to him.
How?
How?
He just said...that I'd shock Eugene and then things would change for him.
He just said...that I'd shock Eugene and then things would change for him.
I don't understand.
I don't understand.
I still don't either, even after all these years.
Because Becker resigned after the charges brought against him by State Patient Advocacy Groups.
I see you've done your homework. [Beat] Alpine Grove's undergone a lot of changes since then. At the time, we didn't have the...resources to help our patients the way we needed to. [Beat] Now, we do. And things are different.
And if I didn't want to come?
I guess I'd ask you why.
I guess I'd ask you why.
Because I don't think I'm crazy.
Because I don't think I'm crazy.
You're not crazy.
You were convicted of the crime.
That conviction doesn't convince me of anything. Until I know that I did it, I'm not going to accept that I did.
That conviction doesn't convince me of anything. Until I know that I did it, I'm not going to accept that I did.
You may never remember at all. [Beat] Your mind's grasp of reality and the real events that have happened to you has been damaged.
You may never remember at all. [Beat] Your mind's grasp of reality and the real events that have happened to you has been damaged.
No. The real events that have happened to me have been fucked up. Not my mind.
Why, what would you do?
I could try to...make it stop.
I could try to...make it stop.
No. I don't want it to.
No. I don't want it to.
So it's helping?
You should be careful. You could be killed if they found you out here.
Believe me, I know.
My God you look exactly like him.
I never knew my father. Did you?
I never knew my father. Did you?
Yeah, I did. [Beat] He was my most memorable patient.
Yeah, I did. [Beat] He was my most memorable patient.
Why?
At the end, he made me change my mind about a lot of things.
You thought my father was crazy?
What case?
I was working with a boy named Eugene.
How'd he get it?
[Beat] I don't know.
[Beat] I don't know.
But Dr. Morgan said you were around when my father was...
But Dr. Morgan said you were around when my father was...
I was. But I saw a lot of cuts and a lot of blows. I'm sorry I don't know more about your father's. [Sincerely] I didn't know about everything that went on here.
Well, do you think Dr. Becker would have any idea?
How do you know about Dr. Becker?
How do you know about Dr. Becker?
My dad wrote some things down before he died.
So maybe Dr. Becker would know. [Beat] But, as I'm sure you know, the statute of limitations has run out for charging the hospital with any liabilities.
Why would we do that?
It's important for you to know who your father was, isn't it?
[Beat] Yeah, it is.
Exactly.
Well... [beat] let me know how your search turns out.
Well... [beat] let me know how your search turns out.
[Beat] We will.
You'll die if you keep smoking those in your condition.
I'll die either way.
What do you mean?
You have no idea what's going on.
You have no idea what's going on.
No, I do. That's what I'm saying to you.
No, I do. That's what I'm saying to you.
Listen to me! You don't! The Jacket is my only chance in this place.
You don't understand.
Then help me understand. You know, you're not alone. A lot of Gulf Vets have begun to experience curious symptoms. What you have might well be a syndrome and, if so, it's not one we know enough about to be treating it this vigorously.
Then help me understand. You know, you're not alone. A lot of Gulf Vets have begun to experience curious symptoms. What you have might well be a syndrome and, if so, it's not one we know enough about to be treating it this vigorously.
This has nothing to do with that.
I don't know. [Frustrated] Remember?
Come on. Tell me what you do know.
Come on. Tell me what you do know.
[Beat] I've seen a time that's not this time. And I'm only able to see it when I'm in the Jacket.
[Beat] I've seen a time that's not this time. And I'm only able to see it when I'm in the Jacket.
Well, what time is it?
Well, what time is it?
2004.
Ok fine. Tell me about it. Tell me about the future. 2004. What does it look like?
It doesn't look all that different.
It doesn't look all that different.
The future doesn't look different?
The future doesn't look different?
No. Not for people like me. [Beat] Not in the places I come from.
No. Not for people like me. [Beat] Not in the places I come from.
What about the world?
What about the world?
I didn't see that much of it -- same as now. I only saw it as part of my own life.
[Beat] Like who? Like MacKenzie maybe?
Maybe.
Why don't you help me?
Because I don't have time.
Because I don't have time.
Why not?
Why not?
I'm about to die unless I do something to stop it.
I'm about to die unless I do something to stop it.
And how do you know that?
And how do you know that?
Because of the future. I know what's going to happen.
Because of the future. I know what's going to happen.
William, that is just another facet of my delusions.
How do you know about Eugene?
You told me about him. I saw you and I think you thought I knew something about him. So you told me.
Some part of you suspects -- even if you don't know for sure -- that what I'm saying is true.
I don't know how you know about Eugene, but these ideas are part of your delusions.
I don't know how you know about Eugene, but these ideas are part of your delusions.
NO! They're not my delusions! Look, just leave my business with Becker to me!
I know. I know it all. Save your strength. I already know everything you're going to say. [Beat] You're in the Jacket right now, aren't you?
How...how do you know?
How...how do you know?
You told me this was how it happened.
You told me this was how it happened.
I did?
I did?
Yeah.
Who...who kills me?
You have nothing to fear, William.
You're going to be ok, William. We just need to get your fever down and we'll be able to hopefully stabilize you.
Who are you kidding, Doc? You or me?
Can I get some paper and something to write with.
What for?
I'm not gonna let that happen.
You still don't believe me, do you?
You still don't believe me, do you?
I do believe you...
I do believe you...
No. Listen to me...the kid, Eugene...
William, I can't indulge these delusions, even when you're in this state.
Listen to me. That's all I ask.
He's having absence [pronounced "absance"] seizures when he stares off into space like he does. He has them so often that that's why he hasn't learned to speak properly.
Who told you this?
Who told you this?
You did, in the future. You figured it out because a part of you already knows this. That's how it works. [Beat] I'm just telling you something you already know, even if you haven't realized it.
I don't know when it'll happen but soon I think, you'll shock the boy and it'll wake him up.
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
You'll figure it out and you'll do good by him.
You know how to get there?
Sure. It's an easy address. A little far out there, but easy enough.
Sure. It's an easy address. A little far out there, but easy enough.
Good.
That's Kingsley. Old bastard hears us, I'm sure. He just doesn't want to bother answering so he makes us think he can't talk. I know. I tried it on my mother for two months once before she fished out my tongue. Literally. [Beat] You're the cop killer, right?
Yeah, guess so. How'd you know?
Yeah, guess so. How'd you know?
TV. Helps numb [makes a "crazy gesture"] any active mind. [Sticking out a jittery hand] Rudy MacKenzie.
I tried to kill my wife.
Don't you go to jail for that?
Don't you go to jail for that?
I tried something like 30 times. There is, as STARKS rightly figures, no suitable response to that.
Yeah, well 30 times probably would make you seem crazy.
Or just plain stupid. You'd think by the twentieth time, I'd have found an alternative method. Maybe a more effective one, if you know what I mean.
What were you talking about the other day?
I wasn't talking about anything.
I wasn't talking about anything.
Yeah, you were. What you said about them taking me out to the woods...
I know you need one when it's really cold.
[Cutting in] MacKenzie, listen to me. Listen. I'm going to die.
[Cutting in] MacKenzie, listen to me. Listen. I'm going to die.
Mortality's actually a great thing to be familiar with. It means you're sane on some level.
Mortality's actually a great thing to be familiar with. It means you're sane on some level.
[Gravely] No, I mean in four days, I'm supposed to die.
[Gravely] No, I mean in four days, I'm supposed to die.
[Beat] How do you know?
[Beat] How do you know?
The Jacket.
Oh no, you're pretty young. Your body'll be able to handle a lot more of it than you think...
No. [Beat] I mean I found out while I was in it that my body's gonna be found in four days.
It's gonna be sticky.
Why?
'Cause Lorenson's got her claws in it now. When she started getting suspicious about me was when they stopped using it on me. Women!
So what am I supposed to do?
So what am I supposed to do?
You could still always give Becker an itch. 'Course you might get killed when he goes to scratch it, but seems to me you're saying that's about to happen anyway. [Beat] Just be careful not to walk yourself right into something.
Geez, how's that for a fucking "thank you"?
Is it true?
MacKenzie, [beat] what if we are crazy?
[Shrugging] What if we are? There're crazier things than thinking up fictions for yourself. [Beat] Everyone does it, don't they? Even Becker. That roller coaster car pops more pills than all of Ward 3.
[Shrugging] What if we are? There're crazier things than thinking up fictions for yourself. [Beat] Everyone does it, don't they? Even Becker. That roller coaster car pops more pills than all of Ward 3.
Becker does? Are you sure?
Becker does? Are you sure?
I've been here for 11 years. It's my neighborhood. 'Course I'm sure. He's as drugged up as the rest of us...I guess he has to be to put up with all this.
You ever been to jail?
No.
It's worse than war. It's worse than anywhere you've ever been.
I doubt it. [Beat] I don't think prison's so bad you don't want to remember it...
Hey, Mister, you need a ride?
Where are you going?
Where are you going?
I'm going to Canada but I can let you ride with me up to the border.
Can you drive?
Sure.
Sure.
Great, get in. We'll switch off in a bit.
If you're deaf, read my lips...I don't need a psycho following me today.
[Beat] I'm not deaf.
[Beat] I'm not deaf.
Good.
In case you hadn't figured, it's Christmas Eve. You're never gonna get a cab here.
[Beat] Thanks.
All right. [Beat] You got somewhere you need to go, Mister?
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure.
Let me ask you that again. This time, look around and consider your options.
I'm not sure.
You don't have anywhere to stay?
You don't have anywhere to stay?
I don't think so.
Well, where are you from?
I'm not sure. [Beat] I don't really know.
I'm not sure. [Beat] I don't really know.
Of course you don't know.
Of course you don't know.
Why "of course"?
Why "of course"?
Because in my life, it wouldn't make sense for me to pick up some normal guy with a place where he's from and a place where he's going to. It'd be too simple. I probably wouldn't know how to handle a situation like that.
Because in my life, it wouldn't make sense for me to pick up some normal guy with a place where he's from and a place where he's going to. It'd be too simple. I probably wouldn't know how to handle a situation like that.
Well, you definitely didn't pick normal or simple this time either.
Well, how'd you get here?
[Beat] I was dropped off.
[Beat] I was dropped off.
Do you have a motel or something? Money?
No.
Well, don't you somewhere? Stuff? Belongings?
Well, don't you somewhere? Stuff? Belongings?
No. [Beat] Not around here.
Great. That was our last option. What am I going to do with you?
Nothing. [Getting up] Thanks for bringing me this far.
Nothing. [Getting up] Thanks for bringing me this far.
Where are you going? You'll freeze out there. You don't even have a coat.
Where are you going? You'll freeze out there. You don't even have a coat.
I'll manage.
I'll manage.
No, you won't. You'll die of cold out there and then I'll have to feel guilty. And I've already got more guilt than I know what to do with. [Beat] Do you want something to drink?
No, you won't. You'll die of cold out there and then I'll have to feel guilty. And I've already got more guilt than I know what to do with. [Beat] Do you want something to drink?
No, I'm ok.
[Beat] Yeah, I'm fine.
You know what? It's Christmas Eve. And you look clean -- I mean, you're normal-looking. [Resolutely, for her own benefit] It's Christmas Eve, and I have a couch.
What's this?
The best I could do with what was in your fridge.
I only lit it because it was so cold in here. I'm sorry if...
No, it's fine. [Beat, swallow] Thanks.
You want a drink?
Sure.
This is pretty good. Considering...
Thanks.
So you're a waitress, right? I mean...from the uniform you were wearing.
Yup. That's me.
Yup. That's me.
You like it?
You like it?
[Beat] I do it.
[Beat] I do it.
Have you always been a waitress?
[Beat] Why'd you stop?
Shit happens, and your life changes. 'Bout the best explanation of a lot of things that happen. [Beat] So how come you don't know where you're coming from?
Shit happens, and your life changes. 'Bout the best explanation of a lot of things that happen. [Beat] So how come you don't know where you're coming from?
I don't know, but I think part of it's...
Well, good for you.
[Beat] Why?
[Beat] Why?
[Beat] Real is overrated.
You don't think that's crazy?
Maybe. [Beat] Maybe not.
This is a great song.
You remember it?
But hey, who can forget those words? The man just wants simple and good things for his woman -- that she be warm and happy. How hard can that be to remember?
May be easy to remember, but not easy to get. Being warm, maybe -- but, look, you don't even have a coat and I still have to chop wood to make a fire. [Beat] And, being happy...you tell me if that's simple.
They told me I joined the army when I was seventeen. That's when my father died and, before that, it was apparently just me and him since I was born 'cause my mom split.
So you never knew your mother?
So you never knew your mother?
I guess not. But, as of now, I never knew either.
I guess not. But, as of now, I never knew either.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Yeah. [Beat] How about you?
Yeah. [Beat] How about you?
Never knew my father. I grew up with my mother. Actually, I grew up around my mother. She was great though. I mean, the way she was with her friends... She was this woman who had so much life in her, she had to find ways to kill some of it just to be like the rest of us. [Beat] She died young.

How?
How?
She fucked herself up day after day and then, one day, she fell asleep with a burning cigarette. [Beat] I came home from work and she was gone.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, me too. [Softly] Every day for the last ten years.
Yeah, me too. [Softly] Every day for the last ten years.
That when you stopped being a nurse?
Damnit, Thelma, don't holler like that! Haven't I told you I can't stand it when you holler in the morning.
I'm sorry, Doll, I just didn't want you to be late.
Hon.
What.
What.
Have a good day at work today.
Have a good day at work today.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Hon?
Hon?
What?!
What?!
You want anything special for dinner?
You want anything special for dinner?
No, Thelma, I don't give a shit what we have for dinner. I may not even make it home for dinner. You know how Fridays are.
No, Thelma, I don't give a shit what we have for dinner. I may not even make it home for dinner. You know how Fridays are.
Funny how so many people wanna buy carpet on a Friday night. You'd almost think they's want to forget about it for the weekend.
Funny how so many people wanna buy carpet on a Friday night. You'd almost think they's want to forget about it for the weekend.
Well then, it's a good thing you're not regional manager and I am.
'Bye, honey. I won't wait up.
See ya.
... only for one day and we'll be back tomorrow night.
No you won't. You'll be back today. Now! You get your ass back here, Thelma, now, Goddamnit. Thelma, do you understand me?
Darryl.
What?
What?
Go fuck yourself.
Honey?
Yes, baby?
Yes, baby?
Do you think you could ever shoot someone?
Do you think you could ever shoot someone?
What?
What?
Do you think you could ever think of a set of circumstances that would just cause you to haul off and shoot someone?
Do you think you could ever think of a set of circumstances that would just cause you to haul off and shoot someone?
I could shoot your cousin Eddie.
I could shoot your cousin Eddie.
Why?
Why?
Because he's an inconsiderate asshole.
Because he's an inconsiderate asshole.
I'm asking you seriously, Sarah, a stranger?
I'm asking you seriously, Sarah, a stranger?
I don't know, honey. I guess it would depend.
I don't know, honey. I guess it would depend.
On what?
On what?
Well, maybe if they were trying to hurt you or one of the kids. I'm sure I could shoot someone if they tried to hurt one of the children.
Well, maybe if they were trying to hurt you or one of the kids. I'm sure I could shoot someone if they tried to hurt one of the children.
Yeah, I could too. But... I don't know why I'm even asking you this. It's just... we can't place anybody at the scene but these two gals that everybody swears is sweet as pie. I don't know. I keep hearing words -- impossible -- inconceivable. If just one person would say...
Yeah, I could too. But... I don't know why I'm even asking you this. It's just... we can't place anybody at the scene but these two gals that everybody swears is sweet as pie. I don't know. I keep hearing words -- impossible -- inconceivable. If just one person would say...
Honey. Nothing's impossible. You just don't shoot someone like that for no reason. Maybe he was askin' for it. Anyway, somebody's husband probably got ol' Harlan.
Honey. Nothing's impossible. You just don't shoot someone like that for no reason. Maybe he was askin' for it. Anyway, somebody's husband probably got ol' Harlan.
That's what everybody says. Only problem is nobody's husband was unaccounted for that night... Could you shoot Eddie in the face? At point blank range?
That's what everybody says. Only problem is nobody's husband was unaccounted for that night... Could you shoot Eddie in the face? At point blank range?
In the leg.
In the leg.
I gotta go to Little Rock.
Who's the nut?
That's Thelma Dickinson's husband.
That's Thelma Dickinson's husband.
Aw, God.
Alright! She did good! Didn't she?
Well, son, she's doin' a damn sight better 'n you right now.
We spoke with a gentlemen today who says he personally delivered very close to that same amount to a Miss Louise Sawyer. Do you know her too?
Umm, yes. She was driving.
Umm, yes. She was driving.
He said he took it to a motel in Oklahoma City. He also says that at that time he met a man. He identified you through a series of mug shots. He also told us that you and Mrs. Dickinson seemed "close." Is that true?

You might say we had a meeting of the minds, yes.
Did either of them ever indicate that they might be running from the Law?
Now that you mention it, they might have been a little bit jumpy.
Now that you mention it, they might have been a little bit jumpy.
You know what? You're starting to irritate me.
How do you know I took it? How do you know they didn't just give it to me?
There's two girls out there that had a chance, they had a chance...! And you blew it for 'em. Now they've gotten in some serious trouble, some very serious trouble and for at least part of it, I'm gonna hold you personally responsible for anything that happens to them. I've got no feelin' for you. But I may be the only person in the
Could you identify 'em, if ya saw 'em again?
Hal, I've told you about twenty times, yes, I could identify 'em, but neither one of them was the type to pull something like this.

Well, you're not exactly an expert witness, but what makes you so sure?
Well, you're not exactly an expert witness, but what makes you so sure?
If waitin' tables in a bar don't make you an expert on human nature, then nothin' will, and I could've told you that Harlan Puckett would end up buyin' it in a parkin' lot. I'm just surprised it didn't happen before now.

Who do you think did it?

Has anybody asked his wife? She's the one I hope did it.

Lena, just cut the bullshit, will ya? Do have any ideas or don't ya? I been standin' in this stupid parkin' lot all goddamn night, and I still got to go file a report before I can go home in time to get back up again!

Well, if I had to guess, I'd say it was some ol' gal, some ol' gal's husband. But it wasn't either one of those two. The tall one, the redhead, she left me a huge tip.

You didn't happen to notice what kind of car they were driving?

It's a nightclub, not a drive-in, Hal. I don't follow the customers to the parking lot.
It's a nightclub, not a drive-in, Hal. I don't follow the customers to the parking lot.
Alright, Lena. Go on home. We might have to call you in for some more questioning.
I've been better.
You girls are in some hot water.
You girls are in some hot water.
Yes, sir. I know.
We're both fine.
Good. You wanna tell me what happened?
Good. You wanna tell me what happened?
Sure. Maybe over coffee sometime. I'll buy.
Hey.
How are things goin' out there?
How are things goin' out there?
Weird. Got some kind of snowball effect goin' here or somethin'.

You're still with us though. You're somewhere on the face of the earth?
You're still with us though. You're somewhere on the face of the earth?
Well, we're not in the middle of nowhere, but we can see it from here.
You're gettin' in deeper every moment you're gone.
Would you believe me if I told you this whole thing is an accident?
Would you believe me if I told you this whole thing is an accident?
I do believe you. That's what I want everybody to believe. Trouble is, it doesn't look like an accident and you're not here to tell me about it... I need you to help me here.
No!
You want to come on in?
You know, certain words and phrases just keep floating through my mind, things like incarceration, cavity search, life imprisonment, death by electrocution, that sort of thing. So, come out alive? I don't know. Let us think about that.
Louise, I'll do anything. I know what's makin' you run. I know what happened to you in Texas.
All we know is there were two women in a green T-Bird convertible that turned left out of the parking lot, going real fast. We're trying to get a make on the car, but nothin' yet. So far, we got nothin'.
Well, you'd best get something. Even if they didn't do it, it times out that they most likely witnessed it. I want somebody to at least talk to 'em. Put out an APB with a description and see what we get back.

Alright.
Alright.
Is there any reason to believe they've left the state?

That's certainly possible.
That's certainly possible.
Why don't we go ahead and let the bureau in on this.

I have no problem with that.
I have no problem with that.
Somebody's butt is gonna bar-b-que.
I swear to God, she wouldn't tell me one thing! Christ! You oughta try to find that kid that was with 'em.
Tell us about him.
Tell us about him.
Just some young guy. Around twenty years old. Dark hair.
This is serious, son. A man is dead.
I know! I'd tell you if I knew! Goddamn! I know something happened, or she wouldn't have left. I'm trying to remember everything! Find that fucking kid. He probably knows something.
Is this the guy you saw them with?
It's him.
Armed robber.
Oh, great.
What kind of gun was it?
A .38.
A .38.
Right. Where are they?
We're going to leave someone here at the house in the event that she calls in. Someone will be here until we find them.
The important thing is not to let on that you know anything. We want to try and find out where they are. Now I don't want to get too personal, but do you have a good relationship with your wife? Are you close with her?
Good God.
My Lord.
Now, for one thing, you violated your parole two days out. And you know Judge Hainey. He hates this sort of thing. Once he gets wind of this, he's gonna blow sky high. And then when he finds out that you're a possible accessory to murder and armed robbery, well, I think we can safely place your ass back in the slammer for at
Oh, definitely.
It's just not working like this. We gotta do something. It'd be one thing if these girls were hardened criminals, but Jesus, Hal, this is makin' us look bad. I don't know... maybe they're not movin'. Maybe that little creep lied.
He's got nothin' to gain by lyin'. Nothin' at all. He already got all their money. I just don't know what we're dealin' with here. Anyway, it went out again last night on Nationwide Teletype. Let's just wait it out a little longer. She said she was gonna call back. Let's just sit tight.

We don't have a whole lotta choice, do we? I can't figure out if they're real smart or just really, really lucky.
We don't have a whole lotta choice, do we? I can't figure out if they're real smart or just really, really lucky.
It don't matter. Brains will only get you so far and luck always runs out.
Hey! Don't let them shoot those girls. This is too much. They got guns pointed at 'em!
The women are armed, Hal. This is standard. Now you stay calm here. These boys know what they're doin'.
I'm sorry to bother you, I know you're real busy right now, but how many times, Max? How many times has that woman gotta be fucked over? You could lift one finger and save her ass and you won't even do that?
Get a hold of yourself! You are way out of your jurisdiction, now come on! Calm down! Don't make me sorry I let you come!
Your name's Harlan? I got an uncle named Harlan!
You do? Is he a funny uncle? 'Cause if he is, then he and I got somethin' in common.
Oh shit.
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
Stop.
Stop.
What for?
What for?
I'm spinning.
I guess I'm startin' to feel a little better.
Yeah, you're startin' to feel pretty good to me, too.
Don't. I'm married. I don't feel good. I've been sick.
It's okay. I'm married, too.
You're beautiful. It's okay. I won't hurt you. It's okay.
Stop it! Goddamnit, I mean it! Louise is gonna wonder where I am. Let go!
Stop it! Goddamnit, I mean it! Louise is gonna wonder where I am. Let go!
Louise is alright.
Don't hurt me. Harlan. Please.
Shut up.
So J.D., what are you studying in school?
Human nature. I'm majoring in behavioral science.
So how come you don't have any kids?
Darryl, that's my husband, he says he's not ready. He's still too much of a kid himself. He prides himself on being infantile.
Did you get married real young?
Twenty-four isn't young. I'd already been goin' out with him ten years when we got married. I've never been with anybody but Darryl.

Well, if you don't mind me sayin' so, he sounds like a real asshole.
Well, if you don't mind me sayin' so, he sounds like a real asshole.
It's okay. He is an asshole. Most of the time I just let it slide.
This is J.D. He's a student. We're just givin' him a ride to... to here. Louise said we could bring him here and then he'd have to go. And that's what he's doin'. He's goin'. Aren't you, J.D.?
Yup. Thanks for the ride. You all take care.
Louise, is that you?
Thelma? It's me.
Well, I guess I'd better...
Wait...! Um, where ya going?
Wait...! Um, where ya going?
I don't know. Nowhere. What are you doin'?
I don't know. Nowhere. What are you doin'?
I don't know. Nothin'. Took a shower.

That sounds nice.
That sounds nice.
Well, you wanna use the shower?
Oh. I... where's Louise?
She's off with Jimmy, that's her boyfriend.
She's off with Jimmy, that's her boyfriend.
That's lonely for you, I guess. I always think of motel rooms as lonely.
I am the great and powerful Oz...
J.D.! Just tell me. I know you're not some schoolboy. Now come on, nobody ever tells me shit.
J.D.! Just tell me. I know you're not some schoolboy. Now come on, nobody ever tells me shit.
I'm just some guy. A guy whose parole officer is probably having a shit fit right about now.
What?! Parole officer? You mean you're a criminal?
Well, not anymore, Thelma, except for bustin' parole, I haven't done one wrong thing.
Well, not anymore, Thelma, except for bustin' parole, I haven't done one wrong thing.
What did ya do?

I'm a robber.

You're a bank robber?
You're a bank robber?
Nope. I've never robbed a bank.

No, I mean how would you do it? Do you just sneak in real fast or hide out till the store closes or what?
No, I mean how would you do it? Do you just sneak in real fast or hide out till the store closes or what?
Naw, honey, that would be burglary. I never got arrested for burglary. Burglary's for chicken shits. If you're gonna rob someone, ya just have to go right on up to 'em and do it. Just take the money. That's robbery. That's a whole 'nother deal.

Tell me.
Tell me.
Well, first you pick your place, see, then I'd just sit back and watch it for awhile. Ya gotta wait for just the right moment, which is something you know instinctively, that can't be taught. Then I'd waltz on in...
I've always believed if done right, armed robbery doesn't have to be a totally unpleasant experience.
God. You're a real live outlaw!
God. You're a real live outlaw!
I may be the outlaw, but you're the one stealin' my heart.
I may be the outlaw, but you're the one stealin' my heart.
And smooth, boy, you are smooth.
You're kinda the best thing that's happened to me in a long time.
You're a little angle, you are.
Jimmy! Hello, stranger. What in the world are you doin' here?
Ask me no questions, I'll tell you no lies.
Ask me no questions, I'll tell you no lies.
Good answer. Same goes double for me.

Hi. I'm okay. How are you? Long time no see.
Hi. I'm okay. How are you? Long time no see.

No, I'm out of town. I'm in... I'm in real deep shit, Jimmy. Deep shit Arkansas.
No, I'm out of town. I'm in... I'm in real deep shit, Jimmy. Deep shit Arkansas.
Louise, just tell me what the hell is going on here! I come back, nobody knows where you are. Is Thelma with you? Darryl's been callin' here every half-hour sayin' he's gonna kill you both when you get back, he's goin' nuts. I don't envy her if she is.
Where'd y'all go?
Fishing. Look, Jimmy... I need you to help me. This is serious. I'm in trouble and I need you to help me. Can you do that?
I have a savings account with about sixty-seven hundred dollars in it. Now I know you won't be able to get it out, but I'm good for it. I need that money. Can you wire me the sixty-seven hundred dollars and I'll pay you back? Please, I'm desperate.
What the fuck is going on?
What the fuck is going on?
Something real bad has happened and I can't tell you what, just that it's bad and I did it and I can't undo it. Can you help me?
Something real bad has happened and I can't tell you what, just that it's bad and I did it and I can't undo it. Can you help me?
Of course. Of course! Where? Can't I bring it to you? For God's sake, baby, please, just tell me what's happened, what could possibly be so bad?
Do you love me?
Christ, sure... yes!
Christ, sure... yes!

You're in Oklahoma?!

Louise, let me call you back after I wire it, so you'll know which office to go to.
Louise, let me call you back after I wire it, so you'll know which office to go to.
Can't it go to any office?
Can't it go to any office?
No, for that much money I have to tell them exactly which office. I know, I've had to have money wired to me on the road. And there has to be a code word or they won't give it to you. I'll have to tell you the code.
Tell me now.
Call me back.
Call me back.
Okay. I'll call you back. In an hour. Don't tell Darryl.

Hey, peaches.
Oh my God! Jimmy! You... Oh my God! What are you doin' here?

Can we get another room? Just put it on my credit card.
Hello...
Who is it?

It's me.
Now, my little coconut, what seems to be the trouble here? Tell Daddy everything.
Jimmy, my daddy's still alive and it kind of gives me the creeps when you do that...

Does it have something to do with another guy? Are you in love with him?
Does it have something to do with another guy? Are you in love with him?
It's nothin' like that.
It's nothin' like that.
Then what?! What, goddamnit, Louise! Where the fuck are you going? Are you just leaving for fucking ever? What, did you fuckin' murder somebody or what?!
Stop it! Stop it, Jimmy, or I'll leave right now. I'm not kiddin'!
Alright, alright. I'm sorry.
Can I just ask you one other thing?
Maybe.
Will you at least see how it fits?
Jimmy... it's beautiful!
Jimmy... it's beautiful!
You didn't see that one comin', did ya?
So whaddya think. I mean... I could... uh... get a job. Of some kind. I mean you've been tellin' me that for years, right?
Why now, Jimmy?
Why now, Jimmy?
'Cause, Louise. I don't want to lose you. And for some reason I get the feelin' you're about to split. Permanently.
I'm the one... I never made it work. I just... It's not that I don't love you. It's not that. I just never thought I'd be thirty-six years old and I never thought... I don't know what I thought. What do you want, darlin'. What do you want me to do.
I don't know. It doesn't even matter anymore. I just want you to be happy... It's not that I don't love you either. But Jimmy, your timing couldn't be worse.
Are you just doin' this to punish me?
Believe me, the last thing I want is for you to get punished.
Don't worry darlin'. I'll say I never found you. I'll say anything you want. We'll find a way to get you out of this, whatever it is.
Damn, Jimmy, did you take a pill that makes you say all the right stuff?
Damn, Jimmy, did you take a pill that makes you say all the right stuff?
I'm choking on it.
Hello, Officer. Is there a problem?
You wanna let me see your license, please?
You wanna take it out of your wallet, please?
Oh yeah.
Is this your car?
Yes.
Yes.
You wanna come with me, please? Walk around and get in the car, please.

Front.
Front.
Am I in trouble?
Am I in trouble?
As far as I'm concerned, yes, ma'am, you are.
Well, wait now. I still have to ask Darryl if I can go.
You mean you haven't asked him yet? For Christ sake, Thelma, is he your husband or your father? It's just two days. For God's sake, Thelma. Don't be a child. Just tell him you're goin' with me, for cryin' out loud. Tell him I'm havin' a nervous breakdown.
He already thinks you're out of your mind, Louise, that don't carry much weight with Darryl. Are you at work?
No, I'm callin' from the Playboy Mansion.
No, I'm callin' from the Playboy Mansion.
I'll call you right back.
Not this weekend, sweetie, she's runnin' away with me. Hi. What'd he say?
What time are you gonna pick me up?

And steal Darryl's fishin' stuff.

I don't know how to fish, Louise.
I don't know how to fish, Louise.
Neither do I, Thelma, but Darryl does it, how hard can it be? I'll see you later. Be ready.
We don't need the lantern. The place has electricity.
I wanna take it anyway. Just in case.
I wanna take it anyway. Just in case.
In case of what?

In case there's some escaped psycho killer on the loose, who cuts the electricity off and tries to come in and kill us.
In case there's some escaped psycho killer on the loose, who cuts the electricity off and tries to come in and kill us.
Oh yeah, sure, Thelma, that lantern will come in real handy. Maybe we could tow your car behind, in case he steals the spark plugs.
Oh yeah, sure, Thelma, that lantern will come in real handy. Maybe we could tow your car behind, in case he steals the spark plugs.
We'd have to. That thing barely makes it down the driveway.
Whose place is this again?
It's Bob's, the day manager's. He's gettin' a divorce, so his wife's gettin' this place, so he's just lettin' all his friends use it till he has to turn over the keys.
It's Bob's, the day manager's. He's gettin' a divorce, so his wife's gettin' this place, so he's just lettin' all his friends use it till he has to turn over the keys.

'Cause I didn't ask him.
'Cause I didn't ask him.
Aw, shit, Thelma, he's gonna kill you.
Aw, shit, Thelma, he's gonna kill you.
Well, he has never let me go. He never lets me do one goddamn thing that's any fun. All he wants me to do is hang around the house the whole time while he's out doing God only knows what.
How much longer is it gonna be? I'm hungry.
Another hour of so. We've got enough food for a month.
Another hour of so. We've got enough food for a month.

We've not gonna get to the cabin till after dark as it is, Thelma.
Then what difference does it make if we stop? Come on. I never get to do stuff like this.
I haven't seen a place like this since I left Texas.
Isn't this fun?
Thelma!
Tell me somethin'. Is this my vacation or isn't it? I mean, God, you're as bad as Darryl.
Tell me somethin'. Is this my vacation or isn't it? I mean, God, you're as bad as Darryl.
I just haven't seen you like this in a while. I'm used to seeing you more sedate.
I just haven't seen you like this in a while. I'm used to seeing you more sedate.
Well, I've had it up to my ass with sedate! You said you and me was gonna get outta town and, for once, just really let our hair down. Well, darlin,' look out 'cause my hair is comin' down!
Alright... I changed my mind. I'll have a margarita with and a shot of Cuervo on the side, please.
Yeah!
Jeez, Louise, that wasn't very nice.
Can't you tell when somebody's hittin' on you?
Can't you tell when somebody's hittin' on you?
So what if he was? It's all your years of waitin' tables has made you jaded, that's all.
So what if he was? It's all your years of waitin' tables has made you jaded, that's all.

Well, just relax, will ya. You're makin' me nervous.
So, Jimmy still hasn't called yet?
Givin' him a taste of his own medicine. Asshole.
Givin' him a taste of his own medicine. Asshole.
I'm sorry, Louise. I know you're all upset. It's just I'm so excited to be out of the house, I guess. I wonder if Darryl's home yet.
I'm sorry, Louise. I know you're all upset. It's just I'm so excited to be out of the house, I guess. I wonder if Darryl's home yet.
I wonder if Jimmy's gotten back.
I wonder if Jimmy's gotten back.
Why don't you tell him to just to get lost once and for all?
Why don't you tell him to just to get lost once and for all?
Why don't you ditch that loser husband of yours?
Exactly.
In the meantime, you said we were gonna have some fun. So let's have some!
Thelma, I'm gonna hit the little girls' room, and then we gotta hit the road.
Ready when you are.
Oh my God.
Get the car.
Get the car.
Jesus Christ! Louise, you shot him.
Jesus Christ! Louise, you shot him.
Get the car!
Shit! I... I, which way?
West. Left.
Louise. Where are we going?
I don't know, Thelma! I don't know! Just shut up a minute so I can think.
Shouldn't we go to the cops? I mean, I think we should tell the police.
Tell them what?! What, Thelma? What do you think we should tell them?
Tell them what?! What, Thelma? What do you think we should tell them?
I don't know. Just tell 'em what happened.
I don't know. Just tell 'em what happened.
Which part?
Which part?
All of it. That he tried to rape me.
All of it. That he tried to rape me.
Only about a hundred people saw you cheek to goddamn cheek with him all night, Thelma! Who's gonna believe that?! We just don't live in that kind of world. Pull over!
We gotta be inconspicuous. Do you know what that means?
Yes.
Yes.
It means you don't talk to anybody. You don't draw attention to yourself in any way. Do you understand that?
We have to think this through. We have to be smart. Now is not the time to panic. If we panic now, we're done for. Nobody saw it. Nobody knows it was us. We're still okay. Now all we have to do is just figure out our next move.
Our next move? I'll say one thing, Louise. This is some vacation. I sure am having a good time. This is real fun.
Our next move? I'll say one thing, Louise. This is some vacation. I sure am having a good time. This is real fun.
If you weren't so concerned with having a good time, we wouldn't be here right now.
If you weren't so concerned with having a good time, we wouldn't be here right now.
Just what is that supposed to mean?
Just what is that supposed to mean?
It means shut up, Thelma.
It means shut up, Thelma.
So this is all my fault, is it.
We're gonna go to the next town and stop. We'll get a motel room. I can rest for a while and then figure out how to get some money. We're gonna need money. Thelma. How much money do you have with you?
What? Oh, I don't know. Let me look.
I'm cash poor.
Hmmm. We gotta get some money.
Oh, I don't know. I'm just nervous. I gotta figure out what to do.
Well, when you figure it out, wake me up.
Well, when you figure it out, wake me up.
Just what the hell is wrong with you?
What do you mean?
Why are you actin' like this?
Why are you actin' like this?
Actin' like what?! How am I supposed to act? 'Scuse me for not knowing what to do after you blow somebody's head off!
You could help me try and figure it out! I gotta figure out what to do, and you could try and help me.
I suggested we go to the police, but you didn't like that; so, frankly, Louise, I'm all out of ideas.
I suggested we go to the police, but you didn't like that; so, frankly, Louise, I'm all out of ideas.
Well, what's the big rush, Thelma? If we just give 'em some time, they'll come to us...! Oh Christ. I'm just not ready to go to jail yet. Why don't you go out to the pool or something and I'll figure it out...
Well, what's the big rush, Thelma? If we just give 'em some time, they'll come to us...! Oh Christ. I'm just not ready to go to jail yet. Why don't you go out to the pool or something and I'll figure it out...
Give me the keys.
Give me the keys.
You're not touchin' that car.
You're not touchin' that car.
My stuff's in the trunk! God! You care more about that car than you do about most people.
My stuff's in the trunk! God! You care more about that car than you do about most people.
Most people just cause me trouble, but that car always gets me out of it.
Did you finish thinking?
I think better when I drive.
Don't get mad, Louise, but where are we going?
Oklahoma City. Jimmy's gonna wire me some money, and then...
Oklahoma City. Jimmy's gonna wire me some money, and then...
You talked to him?! Is he mad? Did you tell him?
You talked to him?! Is he mad? Did you tell him?
No, I didn't tell him. And that's something we gotta get straight. Darryl's been callin', mad as a hornet, makin' all kinds of noise. When you talk to him, you cannot say anything about this. You gotta make sure everything sounds normal.
No, I didn't tell him. And that's something we gotta get straight. Darryl's been callin', mad as a hornet, makin' all kinds of noise. When you talk to him, you cannot say anything about this. You gotta make sure everything sounds normal.
I called the asshole at 4:00 in the morning and he wasn't even home. I don't know what he's got to be mad about. I'm the one who should be mad.

I've been tellin' you that for the last ten years.

Do you think Darryl's having an affair?

I don't think Darryl is mature enough to conduct an affair.

But you think he fools around.

Thelma, I'm going to Mexico. I think I can make it in two and a half days, but I'm going to have to haul ass. Are you up to this? I mean, I have to know. This isn't a game. I'm in deep shit. I gotta know what you're gonna do.

I... I don't know. I don't know what you're askin' me.
I... I don't know. I don't know what you're askin' me.
Don't you fall apart on me. Goddamnit, Thelma. Every time we get in trouble, you go blank or plead insanity or some such shit, and this time... Not this time. Everything's changed now... Now you can do whatever you want, but I'm going to Mexico. I'm going. Are you coming with me?
Call him?
Call him. Don't tell him anything. Tell him you're having a wonderful time and you'll be home tomorrow night.
Call him. Don't tell him anything. Tell him you're having a wonderful time and you'll be home tomorrow night.
Will I be?
Will I be?
I don't know. I won't be.
Louise, this young man is on his way back to school and needs a ride, and I thought since...
It's probably not a good idea.
It's probably not a good idea.
Louise.
I wish we could've brought him with us.
What did Darryl say?
What did Darryl say?
He said "Okay, Thelma. I just wanted to know you were alright. I hope you're havin' a good time. You sure deserve one after puttin' up with me all the time. I love you, honey."
I just don't see what it would hurt just to give somebody a ride. Did you see his butt? Darryl doesn't have a cute butt. You could park a car in the shadow of his ass.
I'm sorry. I'm just not in the mood for company right now. Here. Take this map. I need you to find all the secondary roads to Mexico from Oklahoma City. I think we should stay off the interstates. We're too conspicuous.

Well, it looks like we can get on this road 81 that heads down towards Dallas, then cut over to...
Well, it looks like we can get on this road 81 that heads down towards Dallas, then cut over to...
I don't want to go that way. Find a way that we don't have to go through Texas.
I don't want to go that way. Find a way that we don't have to go through Texas.
Wait. What? You want to go to Mexico from Oklahoma and you don't want to go through Texas?
Wait. What? You want to go to Mexico from Oklahoma and you don't want to go through Texas?
You know how I feel about Texas... We're not going that way.
You know how I feel about Texas... We're not going that way.
I know, Louise, but we're running for our lives! Don't you think you could make an exception just this once?! I mean, look at the map. The only thing between Oklahoma and Mexico is Texas!
I know, Louise, but we're running for our lives! Don't you think you could make an exception just this once?! I mean, look at the map. The only thing between Oklahoma and Mexico is Texas!
Thelma! I'm not gonna talk about this! Now find another way or give me the goddamn map and I will! You understand?
Thelma! I'm not gonna talk about this! Now find another way or give me the goddamn map and I will! You understand?
No, Louise. How come you never said what happened?
He's got a lot to be proud of.
Louise and Darryl don't get along.
Louise and Darryl don't get along.
That's puttin' it mildly.
That's puttin' it mildly.
She thinks he's a pig.
She thinks he's a pig.
He's a real piece o' work. I wish you could meet him.
Yup. That's him goin'. I love to watch him go.
Thelma kinda took to him.
I don't care what you say about him. The boy has got it bad.
He's always got it bad as long as I'm running in the other direction. Don't be fooled, he's no different than any other guy. He knows how to chase and that's it. Once he's caught you, he don't know what to do. So he runs away.

I heard that.
So what are you gonna tell him?
Nothing. I'm not gonna tell him a thing. The least I can do is not make him an accessory any more than he already is.
Nothing. I'm not gonna tell him a thing. The least I can do is not make him an accessory any more than he already is.
You are so sweet to that guy, you really are. Imagine not wanting to drag him into this. He is a lucky man.
I didn't ask him to come! It's like I said, Thelma, he just loves the chase.
Well boy, he's got his work cut out for him now, don't he?
Well boy, he's got his work cut out for him now, don't he?
Put a lid on it, Thelma! It's hard enough as it is. Just let me get this part over with. Now stay here and guard the money. If there's any problem I'm in room 115.
Put a lid on it, Thelma! It's hard enough as it is. Just let me get this part over with. Now stay here and guard the money. If there's any problem I'm in room 115.
I won't wait up.
How do I look?
You're a vision, Louise, a goddamn vision of loveliness, you always are.
You're a vision, Louise, a goddamn vision of loveliness, you always are.
Have another drink, Thelma.
What happened to your hair?
Nothing. It got messed up.
What's wrong with you?
Nothing. Why? Do I seem different?
Nothing. Why? Do I seem different?
Yes, now that you mention it. You seem crazy. Like you're on drugs.
Yes, now that you mention it. You seem crazy. Like you're on drugs.
Well, I'm not on drugs. But I might be crazy.
Well, I'm not on drugs. But I might be crazy.
I don't think I wanna hear what you're gonna tell me.
Oh, Thelma. Oh, no.
I mean I finally understand what all the fuss is about. This is just a whole 'nother ball game!
I mean I finally understand what all the fuss is about. This is just a whole 'nother ball game!
Thelma, please get a hold of yourself. You're making a spectacle.
Thelma, please get a hold of yourself. You're making a spectacle.
You know, Louise, you're supposed to be my best friend. You could at least be a little bit happy for me. You could at least pretend to be slightly happy that for once in my life I have a sexual experience that isn't completely disgusting.

I'm sorry. I am happy. I'm very happy for you. I'm glad you had a good time. It's about time. Where is he now?
I'm sorry. I am happy. I'm very happy for you. I'm glad you had a good time. It's about time. Where is he now?
Taking a shower.
Taking a shower.
You left that guy alone in the room?
Eighty-eight dollars ain't gonna make a dent, baby girl.
Don't worry about it. You want anything?
Don't worry about it. You want anything?
No.
Drive! Drive away!
What happened?
I'm sorry. Well, we need the money. Now we have it.
Oh shit, Thelma!! Shit! Shit! Shit!
Oh shit, Thelma!! Shit! Shit! Shit!
Now you get a grip, Louise! Just drive us to Goddamn Mexico, will ya!
Now you get a grip, Louise! Just drive us to Goddamn Mexico, will ya!
Okay. Shit, Thelma! What'd you do? I mean, what did you say?
Okay. Shit, Thelma! What'd you do? I mean, what did you say?
Well, I just...
Holy shit.
Lemme see the map.
For the first time in my life, I wish this car wasn't green.
Are you sure we should be driving like this? In broad daylight and everything?
Are you sure we should be driving like this? In broad daylight and everything?
No we shouldn't, but I want to put some distance between us and the scene of our last Goddamn crime!
No we shouldn't, but I want to put some distance between us and the scene of our last Goddamn crime!
Oooooweee!! You shoulda seen me! Like I'd been doin' it all my life! Nobody would ever believe it.
Oooooweee!! You shoulda seen me! Like I'd been doin' it all my life! Nobody would ever believe it.
You think you've found your calling?
You think you've found your calling?
Maybe. Maybe. The call of the wild!
You're disturbed.
Yes! I believe I am!
So what's the plan, Thelma? You just gonna stay drunk?
Try to.
Try to.
Litterbug.
Ugh!! Why do they have to do that?
They think we like it. Maybe they think it turns us on.
Thelma.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I want you to call Darryl.
I want you to call Darryl.
What for?
What for?
To find out if he knows anything. If you think he does, you gotta hang up because it means the police have told him and the phone is probably tapped.

Jeez, Louise, tapped the phone? You think so?
Jeez, Louise, tapped the phone? You think so?
Oh, come on! Murder one and armed robbery, Thelma!
Oh, come on! Murder one and armed robbery, Thelma!
Murder one! God, Louise, can't we even say it was self-defense?
Murder one! God, Louise, can't we even say it was self-defense?
But it wasn't! We got away! We were walkin' away!
But it wasn't! We got away! We were walkin' away!
They don't know that! It was just you and me there. I'll say he raped me and you had to shoot him! I mean, it's almost the truth!
They don't know that! It was just you and me there. I'll say he raped me and you had to shoot him! I mean, it's almost the truth!
It won't work.
It won't work.
Why not?!
Why not?!
No physical evidence. We can't prove he did it. We probably can't even prove he touched you by now.
Besides, what do we say about the robbery? No excuse for that. No such thing as justifiable robbery.
Alright, Louise!
Fill her up. There's a phone right over there.
Let's get it over with.
That J.D. kid is a little shit.
What.
How'd they find out we're going to Mexico, Thelma, how they know that?
I... I...
I... I...
You told that thievin' little shit where we were goin'?!
I just told him if he ever gets to Mexico to look us up. I asked him not to tell. I didn't think he would tell anybody.
Why not?! What's he got to lose? Other than my life's savings, that is. Shit!
Just stop talkin' to people, Thelma! Stop bein' so open! We're fugitives now. Let's behave that way!
You're right.
Louise? Where are we?
Just past Boise City.
Just past Boise City.
Idaho?
Idaho?
Oklahoma, Thelma. We're crossing into New Mexico.
Oklahoma, Thelma. We're crossing into New Mexico.
I always wanted to see New Mexico.
Now what?
Now what what?
Now what what?
Whaddo we do?
Whaddo we do?
Oh, I don't know, Thelma. I guess maybe we could turn ourselves in and spend our lives trading cigarettes for mascara so we can look nice when our families come to visit us on Saturdays. Maybe we could have children with the prison guards.
Oh, I don't know, Thelma. I guess maybe we could turn ourselves in and spend our lives trading cigarettes for mascara so we can look nice when our families come to visit us on Saturdays. Maybe we could have children with the prison guards.
I'm not suggestin' that! I'm not goin' back. No matter what happens. So don't worry about me.
Can I ask you kind of a weird question?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Of all the things in the world that scare you, what's the worst thing that scares you the most?
Of all the things in the world that scare you, what's the worst thing that scares you the most?
You mean now or before?

Before.

I guess I always thought the worst thing that could happen would be to end up old and alone in some crummy apartment with one of those little dogs.

Well, to be honest, the idea of getting old with Darryl was kinda startin' to get to me.
Well, to be honest, the idea of getting old with Darryl was kinda startin' to get to me.
I can see that.
I can see that.
I mean, look how different he looks just since high school. It's bad enough I have to get old, but doin' it with Darryl around is only gonna make it worse. I mean, I don't think he's gonna be very nice about it.

Well, now, maybe you won't have to.
Well, now, maybe you won't have to.
Always lookin' on the bright side, aren't ya?
This is so beautiful.
Gosh. It sure is.
Gosh. It sure is.
I always wanted to travel. I just never got the opportunity.
I always wanted to travel. I just never got the opportunity.
Well, you got it now.
Look! Look who it is, Thelma. I'll be darned. What's he doin' way out here.
Just ignore him.
Oh, Christ. I hate this guy.
We should have just ignored him.
What?
Nothing. It's not funny.
Nothing. It's not funny.
What? What's not funny, Thelma!
What?!
Harlan.
Harlan.
What?! What about him?!
What?! What about him?!
Just the look on his face when you... ... it's not funny.
Just the look on his face when you... ... it's not funny.
Now, Thelma, that is not...
Boy, he wasn't expectin' that!
Thelma!
Thelma!
Suck my dick... Boom!!
I don't want to talk about it! Thelma, I'm not kidding! Don't you even...
... in Texas... didn't it? That's what happened... Oh my God.
I'm warning you, Thelma. You better drop it right now! I don't want to talk about it!
Okay, Louise... It's okay.
What do we do? What do you want to do?!
I don't know! Shit! Let's just play it by ear. He may not know. He may just give me a ticket.
I don't know! Shit! Let's just play it by ear. He may not know. He may just give me a ticket.
Please, God, please don't let us get caught. Please, please, please...
I told you to slow down. Hell, Officer, I told her to slow down.
About how fast was I going?
I am really sorry about this.
I swear, before yesterday, neither one of us would have ever pulled a stunt like this. But if you ever met my husband, you'd know why I just can... You wanna step out of the car, please? You wanna put your hands on your head, please? Louise, shoot the radio.

What?
What?
Shoot the radio!
Sorry!
Sorry!
Ready?
Hit it.
I know it's crazy, Louise, but I just feel like I've got a knack for this shit.
I believe you.
Louise... are we still going to Mexico?
Yes.
Well, I figure if you take a state policeman, shoot up his car, take his gun and lock him in the trunk, it's best to just get on out of the state if you can.
Just asking.
I don't want to see any more beef jerky. I mean the next beef jerky you hand me is going out the window. It's drivin' me crazy. The whole car smells like it.
It's good. It's what the pioneers ate.
It's good. It's what the pioneers ate.
I don't care what the damn pioneers ate. You just keep that shit away from me, now I mean it.
And I don't want any more Wild Turkey, either. It's burning a hole in my stomach.
Okay, okay... I've got some tequila. You want some tequila?
Okay, okay... I've got some tequila. You want some tequila?
You do?
You do?
Yeah, you want it?
Yeah, you want it?
Yeah.
Shit. I'm gettin' tired.
Are you alright?
I think I've really fucked up. I think I've got us in a situation where we could both get killed. Why didn't we just go straight to the police.
You know why. You already said.
You know why. You already said.
What'd I say again?
What'd I say again?
Nobody would believe us. We'd still get in trouble. We'd still have our lives ruined. And you know what else?
Nobody would believe us. We'd still get in trouble. We'd still have our lives ruined. And you know what else?
What?
What?
That guy was hurtin' me. And if you hadn't come out when you did, he'd a hurt me a lot worse. And probably nothin' woulda happened to him. 'Cause everybody did see me dancin' with him all night. And they woulda made out like I asked for it. And my life woulda been ruined a whole lot worse than it is now. At least

No, Louise, you said the first part. I said all the rest.

Whatever.

Yes, Thelma?
Yes, Thelma?
You're not gonna give up on me, are ya?

You're not gonna make some deal with that guy, are you? I mean, I just wanna know.
You're not gonna make some deal with that guy, are you? I mean, I just wanna know.
No, Thelma. I'm not gonna make any deals.
No, Thelma. I'm not gonna make any deals.
I can understand if you're thinkin' about it. I mean, in a way, you've got something to go back for. I mean Jimmy and everything.
Thelma, that is not an option.
But I don't know... something's crossed over in me and I can't go back. I mean, I just couldn't live...
But I don't know... something's crossed over in me and I can't go back. I mean, I just couldn't live...
I know. I know what you mean. I don't wanna end up on the damn Geraldo Show.
He said they're charging us with murder.
Eeuww.
Eeuww.
And we have to decide whether we want to come out of this dead or alive.
And we have to decide whether we want to come out of this dead or alive.
Gosh, didn't he say anything positive at all?
Louise, do you think we should change cars, get another car?
Sure... You know how to hotwire a car?
Sure... You know how to hotwire a car?
No.
No.
Well, let me know when you figure it out.
You awake?
You could call it that. My eyes are open.
You could call it that. My eyes are open.
Me too. I feel awake.
Me too. I feel awake.
Good.
Good.
Wide awake. I don't remember ever feelin' this awake. Everything looks different. You know what I mean. I know you know what I mean. Everything looks new. Do you feel like that? Like you've got something to look forward to?
We'll be drinkin' margaritas by the sea, Mamasita.
We can change our names.
We can change our names.
We can live in a hacienda.
We can live in a hacienda.
I wanna get a job. I wanna work at Club Med.
I wanna get a job. I wanna work at Club Med.
Yes! Yes! Now what kind of deal do you think that cop can come up with to beat that?
Yes! Yes! Now what kind of deal do you think that cop can come up with to beat that?
It'd have to be pretty good.
It'd have to be pretty good.
It would have to be pretty damn good.
We should head a little further in. There's not that many roads in this state. I want to try to hit Mexico somewhere not so close to New Mexico. They probably wanna kill us in New Mexico.
You're drivin'.
Oh my God! Louise! Look! Look! See if that's him!
It's him. He's got California plates. It's the same guy.
It's him. He's got California plates. It's the same guy.
Pass him!
I mean really! That business with your tongue. What is that? That's disgusting!
And, oh my God, that other thing, that pointing to your lap? What's that supposed to mean exactly? Does that mean pull over, I want to show you what a big fat slob I am or...
And, oh my God, that other thing, that pointing to your lap? What's that supposed to mean exactly? Does that mean pull over, I want to show you what a big fat slob I am or...
Does that mean suck my dick?
Hey. Where'd you learn to shoot like that?
Texas... You were right about what happened to me there.
You know what's happened, don't you?
What?
What?
We've gone insane.
We've gone insane.
Yup.
I guess we shoulda made some kinda plan for what to do if we get caught.
Yeah, right. We're not gonna get caught.
How far are we from Mexico?
About two hundred and fifty miles.
About two hundred and fifty miles.
How long do you think that'll take?
Shit!
Did you see that guy?! He was right in the middle of the road!
Shit!
What?!
What?!
What?! What d'you think?!
What?! What d'you think?!
Oh.
We probably shoulda filled up the car before we blew up that truck.
Why?
Why?
They'll probably catch us when we have to stop for gas!
They'll probably catch us when we have to stop for gas!
I know this whole thing was my fault. I know it is.
I know this whole thing was my fault. I know it is.
There's one thing you oughta understand by now, Thelma, it's not your fault.
There's one thing you oughta understand by now, Thelma, it's not your fault.
Louise... no matter what happens, I'm glad I came with you.
Louise... no matter what happens, I'm glad I came with you.
You're crazy.
You're a good friend.
You too, sweetie, the best.
You too, sweetie, the best.
I guess I went a little crazy, huh?
I guess I went a little crazy, huh?
No... You've always been crazy. This is just the first chance you've had to really express yourself.
No... You've always been crazy. This is just the first chance you've had to really express yourself.
I guess everything from here on in is going to be pretty shitty.
I guess everything from here on in is going to be pretty shitty.
Unbearable, I'd imagine.
Unbearable, I'd imagine.
I guess everything we've got to lose is already gone anyway.

How do you stay so positive?
Louise!
What?!
What?!
What in the hell is that up there?
What in the hell is that up there?
Where?!
Where?!
Way up ahead!
What in the hell is it?!
It's the Goddamn Grand Canyon!
Isn't it beautiful?!!
It's grand!
God! It looks like the Army!
All this for us?
Now what?
We're not giving up, Thelma.

We been seein' you all along the way.
Yeah. I been seein' you, too.

You know good and damn well what I'm talkin' about.
You women are crazy!
You got that right.
I'm not apologizing for shit!
Say you're sorry.
Say you're sorry.
Fuck that.
Are you going to apologize or not?
Fuck you.
Hi!
Hi there! You alright?
Hi there! You alright?
We're fine! How are you?
We're fine! How are you?
Grrrreat!
Where you goin'?
Fresno.
Oh, Jesus!
You probably even called us beavers on your CB radio, didn't you?
You probably even called us beavers on your CB radio, didn't you?
Yeah... sure did.
Yeah... sure did.
Damn. I hate that! I hate bein' called a beaver, don't you?
Hey, shit-for-brains, be careful not to scratch that thing, huh?
What?
What?
You heard me. You already put a fucking nick in my piano.

I'll try to be more careful.

S'matter with you? You look like you're fading.

The thing's kind of heavy.

Heavy? Heavy?! What I wouldn't give to know what heavy feels like, you insensitive prick.
Heavy? Heavy?! What I wouldn't give to know what heavy feels like, you insensitive prick.
No, I just meant...
No, I just meant...
Yeah yeah. I'm going to the corner to get a cup of coffee.
Isn't that just my luck -- I get caught for everything.
So you admit it?
So you admit it?
Guilty as charged. I'm not gonna play games with you. I could give you a song and dance but what's the point? I did it and we all know it. The hitcher himself told me it's illegal. The irony...
Well, uh, can you tell us his name?
Jeez, I didn't catch it.
This wasn't your first time, was it, Ted? How many we talking?
Hitchhikers? I don't know -- fifty... a hundred maybe -- Who keeps track?
No harm, no foul?
I guess.
Did you get my letter, Mare? The one about Ted?
You sent that?
You sent that?
Uh-huh. I was worried about you.
Uh-huh. I was worried about you.
Well... thank you. But... you know you're not supposed to be within four hundred yards of me.
Well... thank you. But... you know you're not supposed to be within four hundred yards of me.
That's what I want to tell ya. I've been through two years of extensive psychotherapy and you know what? You were right -- I needed help.
That's what I want to tell ya. I've been through two years of extensive psychotherapy and you know what? You were right -- I needed help.
That's great, Woogie, I'm happy you're better -- you seem... good --but... you put me through quite an ordeal, you know.
Look at me, Mary. On my mother's soul, on God above, on everything that is holy to me, I did not steal your shoes.
Woogie, I caught you red-handed.
Woogie, I caught you red-handed.
All right, I did, but I was in a weird place then.
I'm asking you to leave.
Oh, Mary, honey, you're taking this all wrong. I'm not leaving...
Oh, Mary, honey, you're taking this all wrong. I'm not leaving...
...Not until I get a little something to remember you by.
...Not until I get a little something to remember you by.
Stop that! No! Somebody help me!!!!!
Stop it!
Just one pair! You owe me that much, you heartless bitch!
Gay? He said you were gay?
He implied it.
He implied it.
Well you're a writer, and a lot of writers are gay. Look at Truman Capote.
Well you're a writer, and a lot of writers are gay. Look at Truman Capote.
Yeah, but he was successful.
Yeah, but he was successful.
Let me ask you this: When you smoke a cigar, do you ever pretend it has balls?
Come on, that wouldn't make me gay.
I'm going to fix you up with my new assistant.
I'm going to fix you up with my new assistant.
What's he like?
You're leaving it out. Finish your swing. You're going to like this one -- she's half Asian, half American.
Good-looking?
Good-looking?
I just told you, she's half Asian. half American. They're all good looking. You could mate Don Rickles and Yoko Ono and they're going to have a gorgeous kid. It's a foolproof combo.
What's the point? Let's face it, Dom, I'm in a slump. Lately I've been feeling like... well... like a loser.
Loser? You?
Give me a break. Remember five years ago, when your kidneys failed? If you were a loser would they have been able to find a donor with an exact tissue match? What are the odds of that, one in a million?
Oh, so I'm lucky because my brother got killed in an explosion?
Oh, so I'm lucky because my brother got killed in an explosion?
I never said that. I'm saying your lucky those kids found his kidneys. Besides, your brother Jimmy never gave a shit about you.
It must be great with a wife like that.
Each day is better than the next. Have you ever been, you know... in love with someone?
Each day is better than the next. Have you ever been, you know... in love with someone?
Nah.
Nah.
Never?
Never?
Well once. Mary.
Mary again.
Look, I admit it was brief, but it was definitely love. Crushes don't last twelve years.
Look, I admit it was brief, but it was definitely love. Crushes don't last twelve years.
Whatever happened to Mary?
Whatever happened to Mary?
I told you, her family moved to Miami.
I told you, her family moved to Miami.
I mean since then.
I mean since then.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Well why don't you look her up?
Well why don't you look her up?
Yeah, right.
Yeah, right.
Why not?
Why not?
Because I guarantee she's married and has a couple kids. Girls like Mary don't stay single.

What if you're wrong? You just said she's the only girl you ever loved, what have you got to lose by calling her?

I did try calling her. A few years ago. She wasn't listed.

I also called Unsolved Mysteries.

You're kidding? What did they say?
You're kidding? What did they say?
They told me they don't help out stalkers. Look, maybe they're right, it's been a long time.
They told me they don't help out stalkers. Look, maybe they're right, it's been a long time.
I got it -- you hire a private eye, fly him out there, he follows her around a couple days, she'll never know a thing.
I don't know about this, Dom.
Relax, this guy owes me a big one. A couple years ago he got in a jam up in the Boston office; some bullshit about padding his resume -- like we haven't all done that. Anyway, they were going to let him go but his mother wrote a tear-jerker letter that ended up on my desk.

His mother?
His mother?
Yeah, I guess he still lives with her. Seemed like a sweet lady -- got diabetes or something -- so I went out on a limb and got him transferred down to Providence.
Yeah, I guess he still lives with her. Seemed like a sweet lady -- got diabetes or something -- so I went out on a limb and got him transferred down to Providence.
And you think he could find out her number for me?
And you think he could find out her number for me?
He'll do better than that. I'll send him down to Miami on business, you throw him a couple bucks on the side, and he'll track her down.
That's it, I'm making an oath. I'll never procrastinate about anything again. Life is too fucking short.
Hey, look on the bright side --
Hey, look on the bright side --
What's that, Dom? What's the bright side?
What's that, Dom? What's the bright side?
Well... at least now you know.
Well... at least now you know.
I think it was better when I didn't. It was kind of inspiring to know there was someone so pure in the world.
What's so funny?
I'm sorry, it's just that you're taking this all wrong, pal. Don't you see? You're liberated. I feel liberated. I mean here you've been in therapy thinking you blew it with the greatest girl ever, and it turns out that getting your dick stuck in your zipper was the best thing that ever happened to you!
Wait a second, I never told you that.
Christ, Ted, I was only four towns away.
Maybe you're right. I should look on the bright side. I mean, I've still got my health... I'm out of here. I've got to get up at six a.m. to move my boss's brother into his apartment.
What? On your day off? Do you even know the guy?
What? On your day off? Do you even know the guy?
Never met him.
Never met him.
Jesus, Ted, you've got to finish that damn novel so you can quit that stupid magazine.
Jesus, Ted, you've got to finish that damn novel so you can quit that stupid magazine.
Amen to that.
Mary's a babe!
What?
What?
My Mary -- she's not in Japan, she's single, and she's got no rugrats. She does have a little gambling problem, she plays the football cards a bit too much, but she's a babe, a surgeon babe!

Huh? But why did Healy?

Well think about it.
No You mean...?
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
The lazy fuck just didn't bother to look her up.
The lazy fuck just didn't bother to look her up.
That sneaky prick was probably practicing his jai alai.
Well then you've got to call her, man.
Fuck calling her. I'm going down there.
You are one lucky sonofabitch, you know that?
I am?
I am?
Didn't they tell you? That hitcher was just about to cut your throat when you stopped to take a leak. You got a fucking horseshoe up your ass, man.
Didn't they tell you? That hitcher was just about to cut your throat when you stopped to take a leak. You got a fucking horseshoe up your ass, man.
Yeah feels like it.
How the hell did you get here anyway?
Flew. Told my wife I was going to a Promise Keepers convention.
Shoot.
Remember our friend Healy? Well, I didn't know where to mail his last paycheck so I sent my assistant by his mother's apartment. Turns out there is no diabetic mom. Landlord said she's been dead for ten years.

And this adversely affects me how...?
And this adversely affects me how...?
Don't you see? -- Healy lied to us about everything! The landlord said when he got back from Miami he kept talking about falling for some doctor named Mary!
Fuck me. Let's go home.
No! You've gone through way too much to back down now. Get over there and do something -- I can't stand watching this.
Well? What are you waiting for?
I don't know what to say.
I don't know what to say.
Tell her the truth about Healy! Blow the schmuck out of the water.
Tell her the truth about Healy! Blow the schmuck out of the water.
Are you crazy? I've unleashed a psycho on her. She's gonna be fucking pissed. She's even more beautiful than I remember.
Oh God, I'm fucking nervous. I don't know if I'm ready for this, man.
Just relax. Have you hit the cash machine?
Just relax. Have you hit the cash machine?
Got cash.
Got cash.
Car clean? Plenty of gas?

Check.

Copped a tin of Altoids at the car wash.
Okay, sounds like you're all set. Just clean the pipes and it's a go.
Hm?
Hm?
You know, clean the pipes.
You know, clean the pipes.
Pipes? What are you talking about?
Pipes? What are you talking about?
You jerk off before all big dates, right? Tell me you jerk off before your big dates.
Think about it: After you've had sex with a girl and the two of you are laying in bed, are you nervous?
No.
Why's that?
I'm usually too tired to be.
Wrong. It's because you ain't got the baby batter in your brain any more. That'll fuck with your head, that stuff will.
Huh.
Huh.
The most honest moment in a man's life is the five minutes after he's blown a load. That's a medical fact. And it's because you're no longer trying to get laid. You're actually thinking like a girl. They love that.

You bet your ass I'm right. You don't go out with a loaded gun, you empty the barrels!

Holy shit, I've been going out with a loaded gun!
Holy shit, I've been going out with a loaded gun!
People get hurt that way.
Dom? What are you?
You stole her from me. Now I want her back.
Dom Wooganowski. Duh.
But but you're married. You have kids a great wife.
But but you're married. You have kids a great wife.
If you're so happy with them, please, be my guest.
So... I see you made the news.
It wasn't my truck -- I was helping out a guy in a wheelchair.
It wasn't my truck -- I was helping out a guy in a wheelchair.
Uh-huh. Where was he?
Uh-huh. Where was he?
Out getting coffee.
Out getting coffee.
Yeah, that's more or less what the others said, too. Out getting coffee... supposed to meet him here... picking up my grandma...
Bob, do you remember Mary?
Who?
Who?
Mary.
Mary.
From high school Mary? Yeah, I saw her about six months ago at a convention in Las Vegas.
A convention? How'd you see her at a convention?
I'm an orthopedic surgeon, she's an orthopedic surgeon.
Why don't you be a gentleman and ask Rosey?
Who?
Who?
Big guy -- goes to Barrington high school.
Woogie from Borrington high? Sounds like a loser.
Loser? Woogie was all-state football and and basketball and valedictorian of his class.
I got twenty bucks says you're full of shit.
Oh come on, why would I lie?
Oh come on, why would I lie?
Because you're a loser, and in some warped way this gives you a momentary sense of worth.
This is a good one, Mare. Sounds like his partner's all lubed up.
Call you back.
You mean he doesn't like bad guys.
'That right?
'That right?
He can tell you're an animal nut. You are, aren't ya?
He can tell you're an animal nut. You are, aren't ya?
Truth is I usually get along better with animals than with people. In Nepal the villagers call me 'Kin-tan- tee', which means 'man who is loved by many animals... ...who love him a lot, too... and so on.'
Would you like a glass of tea or something?
You got a brew?
Would you like a little clam-dip, honey?
No, thanks. Love a little bundt cake if you have some!
We're in love with your roommate.
Aw, Christ, I can't take it anymore. I'm gonna pack my bags and go back to my own place.
Healy you dog!
Fucking Sully! Look at you!
Fucking Sully! Look at you!
You hot shit. Ya look fuckin' pisser.
Here's the info you asked for.

Stalker, huh?
Stalker, huh?
Big time.
Very nice.
I'm doing okay. I gotta get ready for work.
Okay? With this pad, the killer wheels? Looks like you really cleaned up your act.
What can I tell you? It's a healthier lifestyle down here, and it's easier to succeed when your head's clear. Those guys I worked with back in Boston, they were a bad influence.

Fuckin' animals. Hey, what do you say we go grab a couple drinks.
Fuckin' animals. Hey, what do you say we go grab a couple drinks.
Not for me, buddy. I don't drink anymore.

Yeah, and you don't drink any less, right?
Take it easy, that's Bill.
Tell Bill to get the fuck off!

What are you talking about? You were never an alky, you were a cokehead.
Yeah, well when you quit blow, you gotta quit the booze, too.
Yeah, well when you quit blow, you gotta quit the booze, too.
Is that right? Well good for you, Sull, I'm proud of you.
Here, just have one of these then.
Healy, what I just tell you?
Healy, what I just tell you?
This is a light beer. You can't have a light beer?
This is a light beer. You can't have a light beer?
No I can't.
I'm worried about you, man. You better learn to have a pop once in a while or you're gonna fall off the wagon. You're being a fanatic and that ain't healthy.
Am I?
Am I?
Bet your ass you are. Now I don't want to hear anymore of your happy horseshit. You gotta learn how to bend a little or believe me... you're gonna break.
Jesus, you know what? This shit doesn't even taste good to me anymore.
Ah, fuck ya then, you big pussy. What are you, spotting?
Hello...? Sully...? Sully, that you?
Who the fuck is it to you?
Who the fuck is it to you?
Sully, it's Healy. What's going on over there?
Uh, I'm fine. Just wanted to let you know I'll have your car back in a couple hours, I'm still staking out this girl's apartment.
You found my car?!
So where the hell are you, Healy?
Ah, I got a date tonight with that Mary girl I told you about.
Ah, I got a date tonight with that Mary girl I told you about.
The sawbones?
The sawbones?
Yep.
Oh yeah.
Dumbshit.
Why didn't you just tell her the truth?
I don't know. I guess... it just seems that women today are more impressed by the mighty buck than by some schmo who spent the last seventeen years scraping by on Peace Corp wages.
But Jesus, Pat, if she's as special as you say, she's going to want to hear about the things you did.
Ahh.
The bottom line is, I'm not going to use my philanthropy as some form of currency... especially after what I did. I lied to this poor girl. Lied, man. She deserved better.
Hey, love will make you do fucked-up things.
Hey, love will make you do fucked-up things.
You said it, mister. I gotta go.
I'm just saying I don't mind a guy with a bit of a beer belly. It means he's a guy. You can have those pretty boys who hang out in a gym all day staring at their reflections.
A girl after your own heart, Ted.
Yeah, don't talk in someone's backswing.
Thanks.
I'm gonna get a soda, you want one?
No thanks.
Oh cripes. Do you have change for a dollar? All I have is these stupid Nepalese coins.
Nepal? Have you been?
Nepal? Have you been?
Not in months. I don't even know why I bought the damn place.
Not in months. I don't even know why I bought the damn place.
You own a home there?
You own a home there?
Well... it's just a condo really. Right outside Katmandu.
Well... it's just a condo really. Right outside Katmandu.
Wow. That's a place I've always wanted to go. Is it true the mountains are so tall you can't see the tops?
Wow. That's a place I've always wanted to go. Is it true the mountains are so tall you can't see the tops?
Not 'til you get about three hundred yards from the summit. That's been my experience anyway.
Here. Spend it on your trip to Katmandu.
Thanks.
Well, it was nice meeting you, again.
Same here again.
Same here again.
By the way, what's your name?

It's right there on your golf bag.
What are you doing with all these blueprints?
Some buildings I'm working on.

Are you... an architect?
Are you... an architect?
Well, just until I get my PGA Tour card.
I'm kidding. Yeah, I guess you could call me an architect -- it's just a job really, a way to keep me moving. My real passion is my hobby.
What's that?
What's that?
I work with retards.
I work with retards.
I beg your pardon?
I beg your pardon?
You know... ...the guys who ride the short bus.

They keep him confined? That's bullshit!
They keep him confined? That's bullshit!
That's what I said, so I went out and got him a leash you know, one of those clothesline runners for the backyard. He's got plenty of room out there to dig. The kid's really blossomed. Now I can take him to ball games, movies -- you know, happy stuff.

Yeah, it's fun for them, but it's heaven for me. Those goofy bastards are just about the best thing I have in this crazy old world. Ooh, hey, I gotta run.

Look, uh, I was thinking maybe we should go have dinner sometime.
Oh, Pufferball likes his little tum- tum rubbed, doesn't he now?
Wow, I've never seen him like this. He doesn't usually like guys.
Sorry, Pat, out of beer. You like vodka?
Great.
Fine. Fine.
Here you go. What's that smell?
The museum? I thought we were going out to dinner?
We will, but first I have a surprise.
We will, but first I have a surprise.
A surprise?
A surprise?
The architecture exhibit! My friend Tucker is going to be here. He's an architect, too. You guys will have tons to talk about.
I know he's around here someplace.
What say we get outta here and go crush a bucket?
What say we get outta here and go crush a bucket?
We just got here thirty seconds ago. Isn't this stuff great?
Is this one art deco or art nouveau?
Deco.
Deco.
Would you call that a portico or a vestibule?
Would you call that a portico or a vestibule?
That...? Vestibule.
That...? Vestibule.
How about -- ?
How about -- ?
When you look at architecture, try not to concern yourself with the pieces -- look at the building in its totalitarianism.
That grandmother of yours -- she's really something.
Magda? She's not my grandmother -- actually she rents the apartment right next to mine. Her husband passed away a couple years ago so she doesn't like to be alone.

And it doesn't cramp your style?

Sadly, no. Well except for the lint.
Sadly, no. Well except for the lint.
Lint?
Lint?
Yeah, I think it's that dog of hers running around on the rug all day -- just makes for a lot of lint. Look at this...
You know, sometimes I wish I could be like Magda and not go home. I'd like to just bounce around for awhile, do a little traveling...
Why bounce when you have your own condo in Nepal to go to?
Ah, I'd sell that. Start fresh in a new place, quit the architect game, slow things down, read more books, see more movies...
You're a movie buff?
You're a movie buff?
Try to be. It's tough going with the crap they make today. If Dumb and Dumber's the best they've got to offer I say thanks but no thanks.

No. But the Boston Globe critic Jay Carr hated it.
No. But the Boston Globe critic Jay Carr hated it.
A fucking moron.
A fucking moron.
Huh. I guess I just wish they made them like they used to. You know, something like The Heartbreak Kid... or Harold and Maude.
Harold and Maude is my all-time favorite movie.
Ouch. Come on, don't bust my chops. I know it's corny, but I do love it.
Ouch. Come on, don't bust my chops. I know it's corny, but I do love it.

Well, I'll see ya.
Mary ah, forget it.
What?

No, forget it, it was stupid.
No, forget it, it was stupid.
Come on, what were you going to say?
Come on, what were you going to say?
Nah, really, it was moronic.
Fuck!!
Huh... that's strange.
Turn it up, Magda.
Hey, watch your mouth -- she's a great gal. I'm the dumbshit for lying to her.
All set.
You look great. Hey, Mare, do I have a rip in the back of these pants?
How's my stomach taste, she says. Hey thanks for picking up the lunch tab, Mare. Sorry I forgot my wallet. I feel like a dog.
Forget it. It was... fun.
Urrggghh...
Warren!
Are you okay?
Not to worry. So... see you tonight, right? Right?
Not to worry. So... see you tonight, right? Right?
Sure.
No!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
We're gonna go out tonight. Oh, that reminds me, I've got to call what's- his-face and cancel.
Hi, I'm out drinking champagne and roses... and I'm really happy. Leave a message. BEEP.
Uh, hey buddy. Oh boy, am I pissed. You're not going to believe this -- well, you'll believe it, there's no reason not to -- but I just got beeped for emergency surgery. Well, um, sorry, but I'm going to have to bail on you.
Woogie, please, you're starting to scare me.
Who the hell's Woogie?
I say none of us leave this room until our young Mary here stops jerking us around and decides once and for all who she wants. Now Mary, I know this is difficult but you really will be doing them all a favor to tell them the truth about us.
Are you crazy? Why would I pick you? You're a murderer.
So, Dom tells me you're looking for some lady-friend you knew in high school.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Any idea where I might start looking?
Any idea where I might start looking?
She moved to Miami Beach twelve years ago. I checked directory assistance down there and she's not listed. She might've moved ten times since then.

All you want is a phone number?

Well, I know you're busy...

Don't play games with me, Ted.
Don't play games with me, Ted.
I don't know, maybe you could poke around for a half day and see if she has five kids and a Labrador.

I don't buy it.
I don't buy it.
You don't buy what?
Ted, I'm the kind of guy who shoots from the hip. Now I want you to level with me: Did you knock this skirt up?
No.
No.
She's blackmailing you, right?
She's blackmailing you, right?
No.
No.
You want her dead, don't you?

You can't be serious.

Do you really expect me to believe this is a straight stalker case?

I'm not a stalker! She's a friend of mine.
I'm not a stalker! She's a friend of mine.
Sure she is. That's why she got an unlisted number and you haven't heard squat from her in a dozen years. Oh you're good, Ted. You're a real piece of work.
Sure she is. That's why she got an unlisted number and you haven't heard squat from her in a dozen years. Oh you're good, Ted. You're a real piece of work.
Look, let's forget it. Let's forget the whole thing.

I get one hundred a day plus expenses.
I get one hundred a day plus expenses.
You get fifty a day, period. It's a business trip, they'll pay for your expenses.
I've got some very, very good news for you, my friend.
Really? Very, very?
I think your life's about to change.
So you found Mary?
So you found Mary?
Right there in Liberty City. And you were right, she's really something.
Right there in Liberty City. And you were right, she's really something.
So she hasn't changed?
So she hasn't changed?
That I couldn't say. Let me ask you something: Was she a little big-boned in high school?
That I couldn't say. Let me ask you something: Was she a little big-boned in high school?
No, not at all.
No, not at all.
Well she must've packed on a few pounds over the years.
Mary's a little chubby, huh?
I'd say about a deuce, deuce and a half. Not bad.
But you know, you shit out a bunch of kids, you're going to put on a few pounds.
So she's married?
So she's married?
Nope. Never been.
Nope. Never been.
Huh?
Huh?
Four kids, three different guys.
Four kids, three different guys.
Three different guys?
Three different guys?
Well I'm guessing. There's a black kid, two whites, and a midget.
Well I'm guessing. There's a black kid, two whites, and a midget.
Oh my.
Oh my.
Hyperactive little fuckers, too. Tough to keep up with in a wheelchair, I bet.
Hyperactive little fuckers, too. Tough to keep up with in a wheelchair, I bet.
She's in a wheelchair?!
Don't look so shocked, it's been a long time. I bet you've changed a lot over the last twelve years, haven't you?
It's just that... Mary. I wouldn't have thought...
It's just that... Mary. I wouldn't have thought...
Anyway, the good news is I have all the information you need. Got it from her bookie -- nice guy. You should definitely call her, Ted. I mean she's a real sparkplug, that one. She seems determined to get those rugrats off welfare and with your help I'll bet she does it.
Thanks, Healy. Good work.
Ted? Don't you want the name of the housing project?
Ted? Don't you want the name of the housing project?
Uh, that's okay.
Uh, that's okay.
You sure, big guy? I'll bet she'd love to hear from you before her mastectomy!
What are you doing?
Oh, uh, I resigned.
Miami?
Yeah, this insurance business is too slow for me. I'm going to go down and try my hand at jai alai.
Yeah, this insurance business is too slow for me. I'm going to go down and try my hand at jai alai.
Jai alai?
Jai alai?
Yeah, I don't know why but I always felt at home in the fronton.
Look, uh, I've been thinking about everything you told me.
Good good.
Good good.
Well I think you're right, I should look her up.
Well I think you're right, I should look her up.
Rollerpig? Are you nuts?
Rollerpig? Are you nuts?
But you said she was a sparkplug...?
But you said she was a sparkplug...?
I said buttplug. She's heinous.
All the same, I still want to call her. I know it sounds crazy -- Mary sure has a lot of troubles in her life -- but, I don't know, maybe I can help her out. The poor thing's had it tough -- she's in a wheelchair for Godsakes.
It's a goddamn bunion. It'll heal.
It's a goddamn bunion. It'll heal.
Oh. I thought That's not it anyway. I know this doesn't make any sense to you, but I just can't turn it off that fast. I still feel something for her.
Okay, tell you what: I'll get her number for you just as soon as she gets back from Japan.
Japan? What's she doing in Japan?
Japan? What's she doing in Japan?
You've heard of mail-order brides? Well they go that way, too.
Mary's a mail-order bride?
Fetched a pretty penny, too. Don't forget, it's the Sumo culture, they pay by the pound there. Sort of like tuna.
Hey, hey, hey!
Surprised?
You fucked me, man? Why would you do that?
What do you mean 'why'?
What do you mean 'why'?
Answer the question, shitball.
Look, you asked me to follow your girl around, and I did and I started to like her, and then I realized I just couldn't in good conscience do it.
Do what?
Do what?
Turn her over to a stalker.
Turn her over to a stalker.
What?! You're calling me a stalker?
What?! You're calling me a stalker?
That's right -- if you weren't you would've looked for her yourself!
Oh Christ... poor dog.
You're a sick man, you know that?
You're a sick man, you know that?
Yeah well fuck you! You just can't stand the fact that it was my turn.
Yeah well fuck you! You just can't stand the fact that it was my turn.
Your turn?
Your turn?
That's right, hot shot! My turn. What's the matter with me, huh? Why can't I ever get the great girl? Give the big pig with the B.O. to Healy, right? Well I was sick of it, man! No more -- it was my turn. It was time for me... time for me... to be happy.
Well you didn't have to blow us both out of the water. Jesus Christ, just because she found out about you, why'd you have to take me down with you?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm talking about the letter, asshole.
I'm talking about the letter, asshole.
What?
Are you telling me you didn't send Mary a letter outlining our deal?
Why the fuck would I do that? I'd be screwing myself.
Pleasure to meet you, Patrick.
Same here.
Mainly I work out of Boston.
Boston, huh? Did you get your degree up there?
Boston, huh? Did you get your degree up there?
Yes yes, I did get my degree up there.

Did you study under Kim Greene?

Among others.

Kim and I are close friends!

Well, I'll tell her I ran into you.
Well, I'll tell her I ran into you.
You mean him.
Really? But he's been married for twenty years -- they've got six kids.
Nice smokescreen, isn't it?
Have you been to Let's see -- Santiago, Chile?
Absolutely! I was there twice last year. Which building is yours?

Do you know the... soccer stadium?

Did you build the Estadio Olympico?

No... just down the street, the Amigo Tower.

I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with it. What style?
I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with it. What style?
Uh, sort of nouveau Deco... with a big vestibule. Check it out next time you're up there.
You know, I really should take your card.
Oh look, it's Doob! Will you excuse me a minute, Tucker?
Okay, Pat, take it easy -- don't do anything stupid.
Who the fuck do you think you are making up that bullshit about me?!
Whoa, whoa -- I don't know what you're talking about.
Maybe this'll jog your memory.
That stalker Ted got to you, right? You're working for him, aren't you, you little shit?
Who?
You what?
You heard me, goddamnit. I... I love her.
I'm a phony -- just like you, man.
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
I mean I'm a fucking fraud. I'm no architect. Don't be a putz -- who's been to Santiago twice in a year? Estadio Olimpico -- please!

But... but you knew people at Harvard.
But... but you knew people at Harvard.
I knew shit. The only thing I knew was that you were a fake and I made up everything else. My real name's Norm. I deliver pizzas.

Bullshit!
...So then in '94 I went back to Dade Community College for a semester and when the Wal-Mart cashier job fell through I hooked up with the Pizza Barn.
And you met Mary how?
And you met Mary how?
Just dumb luck. I delivered a pie to her one night and she answered the door in her nightgown -- that was it for me. I went home that night, shaved my beard, and a week later I was laid out in her office with a broken back.

Ho-ly shit.
Hey, this is a pretty nice place.

Sully...! What the fuck happened here?!
You little fuck.
What?
What?
You fucking prick, we had a deal -- you said you wouldn't fuck me and I wouldn't fuck you until we had this fuck out of the fucking picture. You crossed the line, man.
I swear! I didn't tell her nothing! You probably did it yourself, you piece of shit.
Oh that makes a lot of sense. Why would I rat myself out?

You were following us?
You were following us?
Don't flatter yourself -- I was following her, I always do. How the hell you think I got rid of Mary's boyfriend Steve?
Oh... Sully.
Look, if it wasn't you who sent the letter, and it wasn't me who sent it?
Thanks for picking me up.
No prob, I could use the company. I've been on the road going on fifteen hours straight.

Oh. Well I am.

The exercise tape? Sure, I've seen it on T.V.

Two million copies it sold last year. Two million, man. But not next year -- my idea's gonna blow them outta the water. Get this: Seven-Minute Abs.
I see where you're going.
Think about it. You walk into a video store and you see Eight-Minute Abs and right next to it you see Seven- Minute Abs -- which one you gonna spring for?

Well it's the company motto: 'If you ain't happy we'll send you the extra minute.'
Well it's the company motto: 'If you ain't happy we'll send you the extra minute.'
Huh. That sounds great. Unless someone else comes out with Six-Minute Abs.
No, it should be 'a hockey player with great pecs.'
Ugh, not pecs. Sounds like one of those guys with a fish-net shirt and a banana hammock.
I can live with those reflections.
I'm sick of these calorie-countin' pansies. Give me a guy who likes kielbasa and beer and playing thirty- six holes and still has enough energy to take me and Warren out to a ballgame.

Jeez, I don't know where you're ever going to find a guy like that.
Jeez, I don't know where you're ever going to find a guy like that.
But here's the rub. The guy I'm talking about has got to be self- employed.
Yeah, and you'd probably dump the poor guy halfway to Katmandu.
What's that supposed to mean?
What's that supposed to mean?
It means you're too hard on guys.
It means you're too hard on guys.
No I'm not.
No I'm not.
Oh come off it, Mare. What about what's-his-name... Steverino? You could've at least passed the baton on that one.
Yeah, Steve. Steve was all right for awhile.
All right for awhile? The guy's good- looking, rich, witty. He was a god.
I don't know, it was complicated. He's in San Francisco, I'm in Miami. Besides, Magda's psychic dog hated him.
Is that old crab still with you? Mary, you said you were putting her up for a month -- it's been a year and a half.
Is that old crab still with you? Mary, you said you were putting her up for a month -- it's been a year and a half.
Ah, she's okay.
What? Steve seemed to put up with Warren.
I don't want someone who'll put up with him. I want someone who will enjoy him, the way I do. Do you know what he told my friend Tucker? He said he would've popped the question a lot earlier if Warren wasn't in my life. Well he is in my life and I'm goddamn lucky to have him. The hell with Steve.
Have you been up all night again?
Bet your ass I have. It's an important job, Neighborhood Watch is.

Meaning these are the people you live amongst, you got a right to know if they're creeps. For instance, did you know there's a guy down the hall cheating on his wife?

You picked that up on the scanner. We gotta move.
You picked that up on the scanner. We gotta move.
I confirmed it on the scanner. I knew something was up because Puffy used to bark like hell whenever he saw him and you know Puffy only barks at bad people.
Magda, Puffy barks at everybody.
That's because there's a lot of bad people out there. Hey, Puffy tried to warn you about that Steve guy you was seeing -- he was a fucking asswipe -- but you had to find out for yourself, didn't you?
That's because there's a lot of bad people out there. Hey, Puffy tried to warn you about that Steve guy you was seeing -- he was a fucking asswipe -- but you had to find out for yourself, didn't you?
Okay, you win. Now try to get some sleep, huh.
Jesus, Mary, you gotta hear this -- some cop's staking out this broad's apartment.
No time, Magda, my show's starting.
So who's the lucky guy?
Name's Patrick, I met him at the driving range.
Name's Patrick, I met him at the driving range.
Good lookin'?

He's no Steve Young.
What's he like?
I don't know. He's kind of a mook.

This one's almost thirty years old. It's about a young kid and an old lady who fall in love.
This one's almost thirty years old. It's about a young kid and an old lady who fall in love.
That's exactly why I don't watch 'em anymore -- it's bullshit! Why the hell would an old lady go for a young kid?
The point is, love isn't about money or social standing or age, it's about connecting with someone, having things in common kindred spirits.
Fuck kindred spirits. My little Puffy here's gonna tell you all you need to know about this guy in about two seconds flat. If he starts yapping, he's a loser; if Puffy's relaxed... well, you got yourself a keeper.
Sure. Uh, Magda, why don't you get some more cheese and crackers...?
Oh, yeah, of course, dear.
Bundt cake?
Must have a sweet tooth. See if you can find some cookies.
Hey hey, what did you say Pat's last name was?
Healy.
I'm buying bananas tonight.
Why?
Why?
Back when I was your age I always used to make myself a big banana split after sex. I think you're gonna need one tonight.
Back when I was your age I always used to make myself a big banana split after sex. I think you're gonna need one tonight.
Don't get ahead of yourself. You'll probably need it before I will.
Don't bet on it. Last time I had a pap smear the guy needed leather gloves and an oyster shucker.
So maybe I could find a nice gentleman to take you to the movies.

Knock it off, Pollyanna, just 'cause you're in love doesn't mean everyone else has to be.
Knock it off, Pollyanna, just 'cause you're in love doesn't mean everyone else has to be.
Love? Come on, I wouldn't call it love.
Love? Come on, I wouldn't call it love.
Oh no? I ain't seen you beaming like this since you broke ninety on the Blue Monster.
An old flame?
Kind of. Ted Peloquin -- one of the sweetest guys in the world.
You vicious bitch, how do you sleep at night?
I can't do it -- I just found out it's his birthday. I guess I've gotta cancel on Ted.
Holy shit...
Puffy, get over here.
Magda!
The little shit lied to me about that guy!
Oh, hi hon. Just straightening up.
Where's Puffy?
Where's Puffy?
Ah, he was being a pest so I put him in the bathroom.
Pat's an architect, too.
Hey, no kidding? Where are your offices?
Pat does projects all over the world.
Where would I have seen your work?
What's up, Doc?
Tucker, you look different some how. Did you do something with your hair?
You don't think they're too big?
No no, the bigger the better. But I must say, they could be a little brighter. Nothing's sexier than a mouthful of pearly whites.
He's a nice guy, isn't he?
Well that's what I'm trying to figure out. How long have you known him?
Not long at all, but I really like him. Okay, I know he's a little different, Tucker, but that's what I like about him. He's a guy. A real guy. He dresses like a dork and eats corndogs and he isn't always politically correct and he probably farts, too. And that's okay with me.
That's what you've been looking for -- a farter?
That's what you've been looking for -- a farter?
I've been looking for a guy -- not one of these South Beach pussies.
I've been looking for a guy -- not one of these South Beach pussies.
Look, it's just that something about him struck me as odd last night. He gave me this funny vibe. Anyway, I called some friends back east. They don't know of any architect named Patrick Healy and he's not listed as a Harvard alumnus.
I thought so. Anyway, I hope you don't think I'm being meddlesome. I just think you should be careful with this guy.
No no no, Tucker, thank you.
No no no, Tucker, thank you.
I mean let's face it, Mary, you're beautiful, you've got money, you trust people -- I'm just saying, there's a lot of psychos out there.
I mean let's face it, Mary, you're beautiful, you've got money, you trust people -- I'm just saying, there's a lot of psychos out there.
I appreciate you looking out for me.
Can I pour you one?
Thanks, but I've got to be going. Unfortunately, Doc, this isn't a social visit.
What's up?
Well... I've got a little more news about your friend Healy.
I think you'd better sit down.
Tucker, I appreciate you doing all this, but I'm really strapped for time here and --
Tucker, I appreciate you doing all this, but I'm really strapped for time here and --
Mary, the man's a killer.
What...?
I've got a friend in the Boston police department. He faxed me this this morning. I'll just give you the highlights. After a short stint as a petty thief, Patrick R. Healy graduated to armed robbery by the age of fourteen. At sixteen he committed his first murder -- a pretty teacher's aid named Molly Pettygrove. He was incarcerated until age twenty-two when, despite
I can't believe this is happening. I'm supposed to be meeting him in an hour.
Okay, just calm down. It's going to be okay.
Magda's right, I'm so lucky to have you in my life.
Don't get all gooey on me now, you'll give me a big head. The important thing, Doctor, is you've got to distance yourself as much as possible without pissing this psycho off.
Don't get all gooey on me now, you'll give me a big head. The important thing, Doctor, is you've got to distance yourself as much as possible without pissing this psycho off.
Yeah, yeah. Okay, I think I know what to do. I'll call him right now.
Uh, well... not exactly. You see, I exaggerated a little there.
You mean he's not a criminal?
Name's Norm. I live up in Pompano with my folks.
Oh Jesus...
Oh yeah. Fine.
Thanks a lot, Ted.
Hey, you're limping. Did you just hurt yourself?
No, it's an old football injury.
No, it's an old football injury.
Oh, are you on the team?
Oh, are you on the team?
No, a couple of the players and me were joking around and, uh, I fell off the school.
Oh he can hold you. He weighs two- hundred-and-thirty pounds.
A real Clydesdale, huh Warren?
So who you taking to the prom?
Huh?
Huh?
The prom -- you going?
The prom -- you going?
Oh, I don't know. I think proms are pretty dumb.
Oh, I don't know. I think proms are pretty dumb.
'Cause I thought maybe you and I could go if you weren't already taking someone.
'Cause I thought maybe you and I could go if you weren't already taking someone.
I mean dumb in the sense that they only happen once a year.
Hi, Ted.
Hi, Mary.
I'm sorry. I should've told you, he's got a thing about his ears.
Oh. Okay. I gotcha.
Oh. Okay. I gotcha.
Are you all right?
Are you all right?
Oh yeah.
Ted, are you okay?
Just a minute.
Ted, I'm so sorry. Are you going to be okay?
You betcha!
You asshole, what are you -- Mary! Is that you?
Who's that?
Oh my God... Ted. What are you...? I can't believe this. I haven't seen you since --
Yup, that's right. Junior prom... kinda.
Yup, that's right. Junior prom... kinda.
And did everything -- ?
And did everything -- ?
Oh yeah, healed right up. No visible scars.
I can't believe he remembered you. He never remembers anybody. You know I tried to call you for weeks after that.
Really? I never got a message.
Really? I never got a message.
That's weird. I talked to your brother Jimmy five or six times.
By the way, how's he doing?
He's dead.
He's dead.
Oh, Ted I'm so sorry to hear that.
Oh, Ted I'm so sorry to hear that.
No, it was a good thing. I mean, good in that it was very quick.
Oh. So... what brings you down here?
Funny story. You see, me and a buddy of mine decided to... ah... you know... just... drive down.
Well you look great. Are you married, do you have kids?
Nope, nope -- dodged a few bullets. God, I cannot believe I'm standing here with Mary Jenson.
Nope, nope -- dodged a few bullets. God, I cannot believe I'm standing here with Mary Jenson.
Actually, it's Mary Brooks now.

Nope, haven't walked the plank yet. There was this guy back in college who was bothering me... got kind of ugly -- a restraining order, the whole bit. Anyway, when I got out of Princeton I changed my name as a precaution.

Jeez... that sounds awful. Hey, what do you say we go out to dinner tonight, catch up on old times?
I'm kidding. I'd really love to, Ted, but the thing is I already have plans. How about tomorrow night?
Mary, we haven't seen each other in twelve years. Don't make me wait another day.
Hey.
Hi, Ted.
Hi, Ted.
You look great.
You look great.
Thanks.
What's that?
Hm?
Hm?
On your ear, you've got something.
Sure.
Oh great, I ran out.
Now by killer, you mean...?
I mean he murdered someone and did time back in Boston. The guy's a freak.
I mean he murdered someone and did time back in Boston. The guy's a freak.
Jeez, Mary... I'm...
Jeez, Mary... I'm...
Well, lucky for me I found out. Thank God I have friends like Tucker. Look, I'm sick of talking about stalkers. Let's talk about you.
You hit the ball pretty good for a fourteen.
No short game.
We should play some time... I mean, if you can afford to lose some money.
What are you?
What are you?
Twenty-two.
Twenty-two.
Bullshit, a twenty-two doesn't carry a one-iron -- don't sandbag me, lady.
Okay, sometimes I'm a nineteen.
That's more like it. Two more nitrate-sicles please.
Nitrate-sicles -- I like that.
I say they should put more meats on a stick, you know? They got a lot of sweets on sticks -- popsicles, fudgesicles, lollipops -- but hardly any meat.
I say they should put more meats on a stick, you know? They got a lot of sweets on sticks -- popsicles, fudgesicles, lollipops -- but hardly any meat.
I agree there should be more.
You know what I'd like to see? Meat in a cone. You could put corned beef hash in a cone, or chopped liver.
I like it. And think of the toppings -- cheese, mushrooms, mint jelly
I like it. And think of the toppings -- cheese, mushrooms, mint jelly
Not to mention ketchup and hot peppers.
It's too bad you don't live down here, Ted.
Yeah?
Yeah?
We've got a lot in common.
Well... why don't you move back?
Ah, my roots here are too deep. I love my practice, the people I work with, Warren's got a nice thing going Why don't you just move down here and marry me?
So you're a writer?
Trying to be.
Trying to be.
Well good for you. I bet it works out for you.
Well good for you. I bet it works out for you.
We'll see. If it doesn't, what the hell, at least I gave it a shot.
We'll see. If it doesn't, what the hell, at least I gave it a shot.
That's right. And the good thing is you can do it anywhere.
That's right. And the good thing is you can do it anywhere.
What about you, Mare? How the hell'd you manage to stay single?
What about you, Mare? How the hell'd you manage to stay single?
I don't know... My friends think I'm too picky. I think I'm just a weirdo magnet. I did come close once -- just last year, in fact. There was this guy he lived in San Francisco.
...and then it was all over. We haven't spoken since.
Wow. That's too bad. He sounds almost perfect.
Wow. That's too bad. He sounds almost perfect.
Yeah... almost. You want to come up and watch Sportscenter?
Yeah... almost. You want to come up and watch Sportscenter?
Uh no. I think I'm gonna get out while I'm ahead.
Ted... you're not that far ahead.
Look, Mary, the truth is... I'll be in town for a while now but I don't think we should see each other for a few weeks.
Look, Mary, the truth is... I'll be in town for a while now but I don't think we should see each other for a few weeks.
Why not?
Why not?
Well... to be honest... I'm really crazy about you and it's making me nervous and when I get nervous I'm not myself and I'm afraid I'm going to doing something really dumb before we get started so I think I should just lay back until I regain my composure.
That's really sweet, Ted, but you should save it for one of your books.
All right, let's go.
Um, Ted, I need a moment with Magda -- would you let the dog out of the bathroom.
Yeah, sure.
Uh, Mare, what kind of dog is Puffy?
Toy poodle!
Get out.
Wait, hold on, Mary -- it's not as bad as it sounds. I certainly didn't know --
Wait, hold on, Mary -- it's not as bad as it sounds. I certainly didn't know --
That you put a murderer on my trail?
That you put a murderer on my trail?
Well yeah, I didn't know much about him. I just thought --
Well yeah, I didn't know much about him. I just thought --
What did you think, Ted? That you could spy on me and trick me into thinking you were someone I could... really go for?
Mary, I swear I wasn't trying to trick you.
Then what the fuck did you do it for?
Then what the fuck did you do it for?
I did it because because I'd never stopped thinking about you and if I didn't find you I knew my life would never be good again.
Please leave.
Mary, come on...
Mary, come on...
Go!
Go!
Okay.
Woogie and I went out for awhile in high school.
You're Woogie?
What what are you doing here?
You forgot your keys!
Ted...?
I... I just want you to be happy, Mary.
I... I just want you to be happy, Mary.
But I think I'd be happiest... with you.
But but what about Steve?
Oh yeah, that'd make golf real fun -- the guy doesn't even drink beer or gamble.
Get over here.
Really?
Really?
Really.
Yeah? What do you want?
Um, hi, I'm Ted Peloquin. I'm here to take Mary to the prom.
Um, hi, I'm Ted Peloquin. I'm here to take Mary to the prom.
Prom? You're about twenty minutes late. She just left for the prom with her boyfriend Woogie.
Jesus Christ, guy, what the hell were you doing?!
I was playing a trick. I-I-I had a baseball.
What seems to be the situation here? You shit yourself or something?
I wish.
I, uh... I got it stuck.
You got what stuck?
You got what stuck?
It.
It.
It? Oh it. All right, these things happen, let me have a look. It's not the end of the world.
OH FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!
Shhhhhh!
Shhhhhh!
Shirley, get in here! You gotta see this!
Shirley, get in here! You gotta see this!
What?! No please, sir --
What?! No please, sir --
She's a dental hygienist. She'll know what to do.
Is it the frank or the beans?
I think a little of both.
One guess.
How the hell'd you get the beans all the way up top like that?
How the hell'd you get the beans all the way up top like that?
I don't know. It's not like it was a well thought-out plan.
You're looking at him. C'mere and take a look at this beauty.
No, that's really unneces --
Charlie, that's mean. Come on in, Ted. Don't listen to Mr. Wise Guy here. He's a joke a minute.
Oh. Oh, that's a good one.
Teddy, hon, are you okay? OH HEAVENS TO PETE!
Would you shhh! Mary's gonna hear us.
Would you shhh! Mary's gonna hear us.
Just relax, dear. Now, um... what exactly are we looking at here?
Just relax, dear. Now, um... what exactly are we looking at here?
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
I mean is it... is it...?
No, no, please!
Teddy, be brave.
Ho there.
Oh God.
Oh God.
Everything okay here? Neighbors said they heard a lady scream.
Now I've seen it all. What the hell were you thinking?
I wasn't trying --
I wasn't trying --
Is that bubble what I think it is?
Well, there's only one thing to do.
No, no, no, I'll be fine. I'll just hang my shirttail out and work on it in the morning.
No, no, no, I'll be fine. I'll just hang my shirttail out and work on it in the morning.
Look, son, this'll only hurt for a second.
No! I was pissing!
Yeah, I'll bet you all were. Come on, in the truck.
Hey.
So what's up?
So what's up?
Eh.
Eh.
Great. Great. So listen, uh, I was wondering if maybe you wanted to go to the prom you know, with me.
It's no big deal, whatever I mean, if you want.
See, the thing is, I heard a rumor that this guy I like was gonna ask me.
See, the thing is, I heard a rumor that this guy I like was gonna ask me.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, so... I'm gonna wait and see what happens there... But that sounds great, yeah.
Okay. So is that a yes or a no?
I think I was very clear, Ted. If everything else falls apart, maybe.
Piggyback ride.
I don't mind. If you think he can hold me.
We're here, Warren. You wanna get off?
Giddy-up.
Franks and beans!
Jesus, I think her brother spotted me.
How are you doing, Warren?
Good, Ted. Piggy back ride?
Good, Ted. Piggy back ride?
I'm gonna take a rain check.
See you, Warren.
Huh...?
See you, Warren.
Bye, Ted.
Which is exactly what they appear to be preparing to do, Mr. President. We're tracking 26 ships inbound to Cuba. There's no sign they're changing course. The closest ships, the Gagarin and the Kimovsk, will make the quarantine line by this time tomorrow.
We're concerned about the possibility of an incident with an innocent cargo carrier. If it turns ugly, the Russians could use an ugly incident and bad world opinion as leverage to force us to remove the quarantine.
We've been hailing the Groznyy for the last hour, Mr. Secretary. The Groznyy refuses to stop.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Carrying out our mission, Mr. Secretary. If you don't mind, we're very busy right now. We need to be able to do our jobs.
Carrying out our mission, Mr. Secretary. If you don't mind, we're very busy right now. We need to be able to do our jobs.
Admiral, I asked you a question.
Yes, Captain, you may proceed. Clear your guns.
What --
Starshells.
Get out of our way, Mr. Secretary. The navy has been running blockades since the days of John Paul Jones.
I believe the President made it clear that there would be no firing on ships without his express permission.
With all due respect, Mr. Secretary, we were not firing on the ship. Firing on a ship means attacking the ship. We were not attacking the ship. We were firing over it.
With all due respect, Mr. Secretary, we were not firing on the ship. Firing on a ship means attacking the ship. We were not attacking the ship. We were firing over it.
This was not the President's intention when he gave that order. What if the Soviets don't see the distention? What if they make the same mistake I just did? There will be no firing anything near ANY Soviet ships without my express permission, is that understood, Admiral?

Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
And I will only issue such instructions when ordered to by the President. John Paul Jones... you don't understand a thing, do you, Admiral?
This private assurance represents the word of the Highest Authority?
Yes.
Yes.
And it can be relayed beyond Comrade Khruschev's ears to the top circles of my government
And it can be relayed beyond Comrade Khruschev's ears to the top circles of my government
Of course. Our pledge can be relayed to any government official Secretary Khruschev sees fit to satisfy.
With the caveat that it is not made public in any way, shape or form. And we must have an answer tomorrow at the latest. I cannot stress this point enough.
Tomorrow...
Tomorrow...
Tomorrow...
Good.
Where the hell are you?
Jesus Christ, guys. What the hell's Khruschev thinking?
Did you have any indication of this from Georgi? Any possible warning or sense of motivation?
Did you have any indication of this from Georgi? Any possible warning or sense of motivation?
Complete snowjob. And then we went out and told the country they weren't putting missiles into Cuba. By the way, you realize we just lost the midterms.
He's right, Jack. Taylor is saying we may have some time. We've got to use it.
So if there are alternatives that make sense -- and I'm not saying there are -- we need 'em. Need 'em fast.
So if there are alternatives that make sense -- and I'm not saying there are -- we need 'em. Need 'em fast.
What about the allies? Congress? I think we may need to start letting key people know. And they're all scattered across the country for the campaign. We're going to need to get the U.N. staff in and warmed up. Jesus... I don't even know if we've got secure communications with half our embassies since that the Soviets got that cryptographer of ours.

I don't even know if we've got secure communications with half our embassies since that the Soviets got that cryptographer of ours.
We can't worry about everything right now. We've got to figure out what we're going to do before we worry about how we do it.
As if dealing with the Russians wasn't hard enough, we gotta worry about our own house.
Tonight, listening to Taylor and Acheson, I kept seeing Burke and Dulles telling me all I had to do was sign on the dotted line. The invasion would succeed. Castro would be gone. Just like that. Easy.
There's still no sign they know that we know about the missiles. Been a lot of cloud cover; probably think we aren't getting any good product.
We keep 'em in the dark as long as we can. But I sure as hell am going to test him.
Lying bastard. Lied to my face.
We're split down the middle. If I held a vote I think airstrike would beat blockade by a vote or two.
We're split down the middle. If I held a vote I think airstrike would beat blockade by a vote or two.
I want a consensus, Bobby. Consensus. Either air strike or blockade. Something everyone'll stand by even if they don't like it. I need it by Saturday. Make it happen.

What if I can't?
Well, I'm not.
Then you'll call, right?
Goddamn Stevenson. Jesus. Peace at any price. You'd think nobody learned anything from World War Two.
Somebody had to say it. I respect Adlai for having the guts to risk looking like an appeaser.

We have to pull him. He's not going to be able to handle the Soviets in front of the U.N. Zorin will eat him alive.
We have to pull him. He's not going to be able to handle the Soviets in front of the U.N. Zorin will eat him alive.
We've got bigger problems right now.
We're going to have to stop a ship eventually, show the quarantine's got teeth, or we'll prove McCone right.
McNamara's on his way back here now. We need to pick the right ship. No subs. No armed boarding parties either. We need a little more time to figure this one out.
He gets it, but he's pissed.
That's all well and good, but what do we say to 'em?
We were just debating who had it worse, us or George Washington and his guys.
He didn't have to worry about nuclear weapons.
He didn't have to worry about nuclear weapons.
Yeah, but the country didn't even exist as a country yet. It was a mess, and he didn't have a leg to stand on.
How does a guy get a rep like that?
Doesn't matter to me. If I went down in history like Adams, I'd die happy. All they say about him today is --
Who gives a shit about the midterms now? The Soviets are putting nuclear weapons ninety miles away from us.
You mean there's something more important than votes? Didn't think I'd live to see the day, Ken.
The other thing is...
...I know. CIA and the military fucked us on the Bay of Pigs.
...I know. CIA and the military fucked us on the Bay of Pigs.
They're going to be pressing for a military solution soon. We can't afford to let them ram their agenda down our throats. We need to come with options other than air strikes so we have some sort of choice here.
They're going to be pressing for a military solution soon. We can't afford to let them ram their agenda down our throats. We need to come with options other than air strikes so we have some sort of choice here.
We got a bunch of smart guys. We lock 'em up together in there, kick 'em in the ass til they come up with options.
I'll do it.
It's too politicized with you in there, anyway. They need to be able to stick their necks out.
It's too politicized with you in there, anyway. They need to be able to stick their necks out.
It'll be the principals, a couple of the key guys from each department: the Executive Committee of the National Security Council. We'll call it EXCOM.
Jack, I'm as conniving as they come, but a sneak attack is just wrong.
He's right. And things are happening too fast. It smells like the Bay of Pigs all over again.
What happened to speak when spoken to?
Give it a rest. You were thinking the same thing, just didn't have the guts to take the heat.
Jesus...
Rescind the order. Can all the Chiefs. Put Nitze, Gilpatric and the Undersecretaries in charge.
Rescind the order. Can all the Chiefs. Put Nitze, Gilpatric and the Undersecretaries in charge.
We can't do that, Bobby.
Adlai's too weak! We have to convince Jack to pull him, get McCloy in there.
You can't take him out this late in the game.
You can't take him out this late in the game.
Zorin will eat him alive!
Zorin will eat him alive!
Then talk to your brother, goddamn it. The two of you don't need any advice to get into trouble.
Then talk to your brother, goddamn it. The two of you don't need any advice to get into trouble.
What's gotten into you?
Oh, still sore about this.
Something your father would've come up with.
My father --
-- I'm just trying to make a point. This idea is that fucking bad.
Adlai can handle Zorin. He knows the inning and the score.
He better. Because nobody thinks he's up to this. Nobody.
Where've you been? We've been trying to find you all morning.
Helen and I went out for breakfast. EXCOM's not supposed to convene til eight.
Helen and I went out for breakfast. EXCOM's not supposed to convene til eight.
We just got a second letter from Khruschev. The deal's off.
We're getting everyone together as fast as we can.
What does the letter say?
What does the letter say?
They want us to take our missiles out of Turkey along with the no invasion pledge. It looks like Fomin was a ploy after all, and they were just stalling for time.
And?
And Jack wants to trade the missiles in Turkey.

The Jupiters are obsolete. They were supposed to have been dismantled last summer anyway --
The Jupiters are obsolete. They were supposed to have been dismantled last summer anyway --
-- Jesus, Mary and Joseph. I told you how stupid it was to float the Lippman article! But you wouldn't listen to me. What if there hasn't been a coup at all? What if it's you two who invited that second letter by raising the possibility of a trade?
All right, so maybe we overestimated how reasonable this trade would look. Okay? You happy? So now what?
So now you've got to talk him out of it. And then we've got to figure out an acceptable political solution.
So now you've got to talk him out of it. And then we've got to figure out an acceptable political solution.
And if there has been a coup and there is no acceptable political solution?
We gave so much to get here. I don't know. Sometimes I think what the hell did we do it for?
Because we knew we could do a better job than everyone else.
Slow down. Smell that?
Smoke.
Smoke.
Just wanted to see for myself. They're burning their documents.
Yeah?
Kenny. It's over.
Hey, Mac. You're up bright and early.
No, Ken. I need to see him now...
What's it about?
Cuba.
Helen just asked me what sort of arrangements we have for the families.
I just checked myself. They're being issued identity cards. Call comes, and evacuation officers meet them at pre-arranged departure areas. They go by helicopter to Mount Weather. We meet them there.
What did you think of Lippman's column this morning?
I think it's a bad idea.
You gotta stop 'em. We know it's Jack and Bobby's idea -- they leaked it to Lippman. The military guys are going ape, and they're not alone.
Then they should speak up.
Then they should speak up.
Christ, Ken, you know it's not that easy.
Christ, Ken, you know it's not that easy.
Yes it is.
Yes it is.
No it isn't. They don't trust the people that feel this way. But these people are right. And the Kennedys are wrong. We need you to tell 'em, Kenny. They'll listen to you.
Jack and Bobby are good men. But it takes a certain character, moral toughness to stand up to --
-- You listen to me. Nobody, nobody, talks about my friends that way. You're fucking here right now because of the Kennedys. They may be wrong. They make mistakes. But they're not weak. The weak ones are these 'people' who can't speak their own minds.

You know I don't mean they're weak.
The sun came up today.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It shouldn't have. But it did.
Every day the sun comes up... says something about us.
Says what, Kenny?
I am instructed to tell you that the American Government would respond favorably to an offer along the lines you have discussed. If this solution were raised at the U.N. by Ambassador Zorin, he would find a favorable reply from Ambassador Stevenson.
So I understand you correctly. If the missiles in Cuba were dismantled, returned to the Soviet Union, and a guarantee was made not to reintroduce them, the United States would be prepared to guarantee that it would never invade Cuba?

That is correct.
That is correct.
This is from the Highest Authority?
This is from the Highest Authority?
Yes. From the Highest Authority. There are two conditions. The U.N. must be allowed to inspect the removal of the missiles.
Yes. From the Highest Authority. There are two conditions. The U.N. must be allowed to inspect the removal of the missiles.
And, of course, the U.N. must be allowed to observe the redeployment of forces from the American Southeast.
And the second condition?
Time is of the essence.
John. How much time?
48 hours. In 48 hours there can be no deals.
Max.
McCone's been notified and is coming back from the West coast. Carter's here, though.
We have high confidence in the expanded air strike option. The problem, Mr. President, is that it's a short-term solution. Khruschev can send more missiles next month. The Chiefs and I believe we should follow up the air strikes with the full version of OPLAN 316.
An invasion...
An invasion...
Yes, sir. We can be sure we get all the missiles, and we remove Castro so this can never happen again.
Is this the Chiefs' recommendation?
Yes, sir. Our best option is to commence the strikes before the missiles are operational. The invasion happens eight days later.
How long until the army is ready?
We've just begun the mobilization under cover of a pre-arranged exercise, sir. We're looking at another week and a half, Mr. President.
Guess we can't blame Khruschev for a few patriotic farmers. And the ships?
Still heading for Cuba.
Still heading for Cuba.
All right. Then I guess it's time.
-- I have the authority. I am the commander-in-chief of the United States, and I say when we go to war!
We are not at war, sir, not until we're at DEFCON 1.
We are not at war, sir, not until we're at DEFCON 1.
General, the Joint Chiefs have just signaled our intent to escalate to the Soviets. You have signaled an escalation which I had no wish to signal, and which I did not approve.
So which one of you geniuses can tell me how to explain ourselves to the world? How do we work with them if there's been a hard-line coup?
Mr. President, there is another possibility we haven't considered. This may not be a coup at all.
Then we have no choice. General, issue the warning orders to our forces. They will be prepared to execute the air strikes Monday morning and the follow-on invasion according to the schedule thereafter. I'll need the official release orders on my desk Sunday night.
Understood, sir. We need to step up the overflights, finalize our pilots' target folders in order to be able to carry out the strikes.
Does this attack on our plane represent a definitive, intentional escalation on the part of the Soviets?
The Soviets are in control of the SAMs. It's hard to believe with their centralized command structure that it could be an accidental launch.
Don't forget, Mrs. Higgins wants to talk to you this afternoon about Kevin. You need to do something about this.
Kids are supposed to get detention.
When are you going to be home?
I don't know, Helen. I want you to keep the kids close tomorrow. Leave the T.V. on, sleep with it on in the bedroom until I tell you you can turn it off.
I don't know, Helen. I want you to keep the kids close tomorrow. Leave the T.V. on, sleep with it on in the bedroom until I tell you you can turn it off.

What's happened?
Nothing. Nothing you don't know about. Tomorrow's the big day. Just have the car ready to go if I call or if the Civil Defense Warning comes on.
Nothing. Nothing you don't know about. Tomorrow's the big day. Just have the car ready to go if I call or if the Civil Defense Warning comes on.
What happens to you? I'm not leaving without you.
What happens to you? I'm not leaving without you.
I'll be evacuated with the President.
If you're home it means either Jack and Bobby have finally figured out what a con man you are and fired you, or --
-- we got a back channel communication from Khruschev this evening feeling us out about a deal. He confirmed it just a little while ago in a letter to the President. I think we've won.

A thing like this... who could even think of winning?
I saw you out there. You want him to call you back, need you.
No. I'm glad I'm home.
How's my favorite President?
Busy. But you've got his heart.
Busy. But you've got his heart.
I want an hour with him.

I'm doing a piece on Skybolt. I hear Macmillan's meeting with him in Nassau.
Pretending there isn't a problem won't fix it. He can clear the air on Anglo American relations.
Forget it, Scotty.
Forget it, Scotty.
Let him talk to me, he makes Macmillan look good, I print it, the British public likes it, Macmillan owes you.
It's Tuesday. You said to call. When do I get my 45 minutes?
Tell you what. We're in Connecticut tomorrow for Ribicoff. I'll get you up front with him during the flight.
Tell you what. We're in Connecticut tomorrow for Ribicoff. I'll get you up front with him during the flight.
Deal.
Kenny! What happened? They didn't let me up front, said the President was on the phone the whole time.
He was.
He was.
Yeah? Who was he talking to? Acheson? Come on, O'Donnell, everyone's wondering what's going on. What's Acheson doing in town? And don't give me some bullshit about DNC think tanks. Acheson's Mr. Cold War.
Yeah? Who was he talking to? Acheson? Come on, O'Donnell, everyone's wondering what's going on. What's Acheson doing in town? And don't give me some bullshit about DNC think tanks. Acheson's Mr. Cold War.
Why don't you ask him yourself? You can have him on the way home.
Why don't you ask him yourself? You can have him on the way home.
I'm giving you a chance here: talk to me. You can influence how this thing unfolds.
There are major rail disruptions in the South, two airborne divisions are on alert. That exercise is an invasion.
Well, you know how Bobby has it in for the State of Mississippi.
Well, you know how Bobby has it in for the State of Mississippi.

Dean Rusk!

Wrong, and you get to wax my car.
Hey, sport. You winning?
Yeah.
I guess you won't be coming home tonight.
I, uh...
Get back out there, kid. Remember to hit 'em hard.
What about you? Where are you going?
What about you? Where are you going?
Back to work.
I was eating that.
No you weren't.
No you weren't.
I was, you bastard.
So what've we got today?
Today, for your information, is Pulaski Day. We're going to Buffalo...
Still think Cuba isn't important?
Not as far as the election goes.
Should be here any minute.
Good.
No choice. This is going to cost lives any way we go. Do nothing, and it could be 80 million of ours. We have to get rid of those missiles.
There've got to be alternatives to just going out and bombing them.
Okay. Kenny and I only show for the meetings you call us into. Impress us. And do it fast. You're in charge of keeping this quiet. If word gets out before we know what we're going to do, there'll be panic. And it'll ruin any chance of surprise if we decide to hit them.
Then we need to do a few things right away. No Pierre. He knows, the press knows. You're going to have to keep up your schedule -- your movements are followed too closely. And we need to get these guys out of the White House. George Ball's got a conference room at State. Reconvene over there this afternoon, come back here tonight.
Call me Irish, but I don't believe in cooler heads prevailing.
Acheson's scenario is unacceptable. And he has more experience than anyone.
Acheson's scenario is unacceptable. And he has more experience than anyone.
There is no expert on this subject, no wise old man.
Let's get out of here.
Cheer up, you've neutralized the entire White House Press Corps for a day.
Have you canceled Chicago and the rest of the weekend yet?
You don't show for Chicago, everyone'll know there's something going on.
You don't show for Chicago, everyone'll know there's something going on.
I don't care. Cancel it.
I don't care. Cancel it.
No way.
I'm not calling and canceling on Daly. You call and cancel on Daly.
You're scared to cancel on Daly.
You're scared to cancel on Daly.
Damn right I'm scared.
We have to try the blockades. It probably won't work. It may just be delaying the inevitable. But we can't just go to war without trying not to.
I don't know. I don't know.
You'd worry that something was wrong if Congress offered you unconditional support.
They want this fucking job, they can have it. It's no great joy to me.
I don't like what's happening.
In the morning I'm taking charge of the blockade from the situation room. McNamara'll set up shop in the flag plot at the Pentagon, keep an eye on things there.

All right. 'Cause you get armed boarders climbing into Soviet ships, shots being fired across bows...

What about these low-level flights? They're starting in what? An hour? Do you realize what you're letting yourself in for?
What about these low-level flights? They're starting in what? An hour? Do you realize what you're letting yourself in for?
We need those flights. We have to know when those missiles become operational, because when they do, we need to destroy them.
We need those flights. We have to know when those missiles become operational, because when they do, we need to destroy them.
Fair enough. But Castro's on alert and we're flying attack planes over their sites, on the deck. There's no way for them to know they're carrying cameras, not bombs. They're going to be shot at, plain and simple.
I'm your political advisor, and I'm giving you political analysis here. This is a setup. The Chiefs want to go in. It's the only way they can redeem themselves for the Bay of Pigs. They have to go in, and they have to do it right. It's that simple.
I'm gonna protect those pilots.
How does a man get to a place where he can say, 'throw those lives away,' so easily?
Maybe it's harder for them to say it than they let on. At the very least, they believe it's in our best interest. And at the end of the day, they may end up being right.
That's going to be tough. You know how these guys are about their chains of command...
Any problems, you remind them those chains of commands end at one place. Me.
We can horsetrade with Khruschev on ships. But it doesn't get us any closer to removing those missiles.
Have to hope it's a signal that he'll back down on the real issue too.
He's right, we can't rescind DEFCON 2. The Soviets will think we've gotten sweet on them.
And we can't purge the Chiefs. Our invasion talk will look like a bluff. Or even that there's been an attempted coup.
What's that?
Oh, just a bunch of crap about withdrawing our Jupiter missiles in Turkey if the Soviets'll do the same in Cuba.
I don't want to listen to this again.
If we made a trade, we'd be giving in to extortion, and NATO would never trust us again. We'll get clobbered in world opinion.

It's a goddman trial balloon. Trial is the operative word, here.
It's a goddman trial balloon. Trial is the operative word, here.
Then somebody'd better deny it publicly.
Jesus Christ, O'Donnell, you're the one saying we need to move forward on a political solution.
Yeah, a good political solution.
Didn't know Adlai had it in him. Too bad he didn't have this stuff in '52.
Zorin must not have gotten instructions. Somebody in their Foreign Ministry's blown it big-time.
Hello?
I've got to move. What do you have, Kenny?
I've got to move. What do you have, Kenny?
They know each other! Khruschev and Feklisov aka Fomin were war buddies!
They know each other! Khruschev and Feklisov aka Fomin were war buddies!
You're sure...
You're sure...
Don't take it to court, but we've got good circumstantial evidence... Walter agrees. My gut's telling me Khruschev's turning to a trusted old friend to carry his message.
Don't take it to court, but we've got good circumstantial evidence... Walter agrees. My gut's telling me Khruschev's turning to a trusted old friend to carry his message.
Okay, Ken. We're going.
We give them something. We tell them we'll remove the missiles from Turkey say, six months from now so that there appears to be no linkage. We also tell them if they go public about it, we deny it and the deal is off.
And we do it under the table so we can disavow any knowledge of it.
Moving the line. Stroke of genius.
Of course it is. But the President needs to realize we're going to have to stop a ship eventually.
You must think I'm blind and stupid. I've already gotten the birds and bees from Bobby. The President doesn't have to double-barrel me.
Listen to me, goddamn it. We're talking about a possible nuclear war. You dropped the ball on Bay of Pigs --
Listen to me, goddamn it. We're talking about a possible nuclear war. You dropped the ball on Bay of Pigs --
-- you sonofabitch, goddamn it, I didn't drop --
-- you sonofabitch, goddamn it, I didn't drop --
You were in the room. It was your purview. It was your job to make sure Bissel wasn't fucking us over and you didn't do it. You've got the most important job in the world right now. You're the smartest guy the President has. Besides me.
At least it will expose whether Khruschev has been overthrown. We'll know what we're dealing with.
And if this is a move to appease the hard line, then it may just be the bone he needs to regain control of his own house.
Dangle a settlement, tie us down in negotiations, we come up short...
Why else would they approach us in this way? It's deniable. The Soviets have done nothing but lie to us. This could be more of the same.

That may be why Khruschev's introducing this guy. We've been burned by his usual players in the formal channels, so he brings in an honest broker.
That may be why Khruschev's introducing this guy. We've been burned by his usual players in the formal channels, so he brings in an honest broker.
That may be what they want us to think.
My specialists are in agreement: this morning's letter is not Khruschev. Last night's letter was. The evidence supports only one conclusion: there has been a coup, and Khruschev was replaced overnight.
Jesus Christ...
It's transparent. The press'll be all over it.
Six months from now, I'm not going to care. Are you? We'll deal with it.
Bob. Bet you had a late night.
Sleep is for the weak, Mr. President.
Bob?
We've worked up several military scenarios. Before I ask General Taylor to lead us through the various options, I'd like for us to adopt a rule. If we are going to strike, we must agree now that we will do it before the missiles become operational. Because once they are, I don't think we can guarantee getting them all before at least some are
Bob, is there any way we can avoid stopping a submarine first?
I'm afraid not, Mr. President. The sub has positioned itself between the Pierce and the Soviet ships. Admiral Anderson insists it's too much of a risk to proceed with stopping the freighters. The Pierce would be a sitting duck for the sub.
Captain, force the sub to the surface for inspection.
Mr. President! We're receiving reports that the ships are stopping!
Mr. President! We're receiving reports that the ships are stopping!
Captain, belay that order! Bob, where's that coming from!
Captain, belay that order! Bob, where's that coming from!
Just a second, Mr. President.
Just a second, Mr. President.
Will somebody find out what's going on?!
Hey.
Hey. Nice tie.
Hey. Nice tie.
Don't get too attached.
Yeah.
You're my hero, Carl.
You're my hero, Carl.
Heroes ain't supposed to shake. I'm shakin', man, look at me.
Heroes ain't supposed to shake. I'm shakin', man, look at me.
Breathe, Carl. Four, nice, deep ones.
Anyone stops us going in, we're with the Bowen-Hamilton Textile Company. We have rug samples.
Rug samples.
Rug samples.
We are one-dimensional, boring peddlers of fine carpet, Carl.
Jesus Christ, Larry, what the fu-- Larry. That's not even your name, is it? What's your real name, you fucking scumbag?
Don't have one, Carl. I have a number, man. Just like the numbers on those treasury checks. You stole from your own country, Carl. Shame on you.
I thought we were staying on the reservation.
Yes. Rooms thirteen and fourteen are on Indian land.
Yes. Rooms thirteen and fourteen are on Indian land.
I see.

Are you hungry? I have some nice raw kidney in the truck.
Are you hungry? I have some nice raw kidney in the truck.
Oh, I'm set, Sir. I'm set.
Mr. Clear Moon.
Our police are afraid of them. Please get them out of here.
They're going to kill me next. That's what I hear. These new Indians are destroying everything. Our people are a quiet people.
They can lead us to Jimmy. Just let them go. We're tightening the net on him. We know he's on the reservation.
Now keep that between us, Dennis, cuz I don't know what kinda Johnny Law they got here.
Hey, Brooks, come over here. I want you to meet a coupla fellas from Denver.
Brooks, what's a perceptive fellow like you, doing in a joint like this? Let me buy you a glass of some of that Russian shit you like.
FBI? What you investigatin'?
FBI? What you investigatin'?
A murder. On the reservation.
A murder. On the reservation.
Again. Figures, man.
You know how in your big cities, you got your niggers and you got your Puerto Ricans? Well out here we got Indians. That's just the way it is.
The only good Indian is a dead Indian, does that old adage still hold true out here?
What are you doing?
James Looks Twice?
James Looks Twice?
That's right. What are you doing here? This is a religious ceremony you're desecrating.
What's this about?
Your good friend Leo Fast Elk.

You think I killed him? Cuz he was an apple? Well, let me tell you something about Leo, Man --
You think I killed him? Cuz he was an apple? Well, let me tell you something about Leo, Man --
-- don't "man" me, Jimmy. Where's the key?
Levoi, Cooch. Raymond Levoi, Criminal Division.
Oh, yeah -- right.
Interesting bloodline you have, Ray. French, Scots-Irish, Italian, ...and one-eighth American Indian.
Sioux Indian, right?
Ray, there's been a homicide out in an area known as The Badlands. Indian Reservation.
It's not the first. There's been several. And our field office in Rapid City is getting a lot of heat... none of the investigations have turned up jack shit.
It's not the first. There's been several. And our field office in Rapid City is getting a lot of heat... none of the investigations have turned up jack shit.
The main problem is, Ray, these people are extremely distrustful of outsiders, non-Indians. Relations have not been amicable.
The main problem is, Ray, these people are extremely distrustful of outsiders, non-Indians. Relations have not been amicable.
Different culture. Hard to penetrate. The Indians don't like white cops poking around. And that's why we're in a position where we have to bring in an American Indian agent.
Taking ol' Leo somewhere?
Leo's been out here too long, man. I'm taking him to ceremonial burial.
Nice piece. You come back here to cover your tracks, Geronimo? What's your name?
It ain't Geronimo.
It ain't Geronimo.
Who are you?
Who are you?
I think maybe you guys got off the wrong exit, yeah? This is the Bear Creek Indian Reservation.
I know where I am. I'm on federal land, doing a federal investigation, and if you don't wanna cooperate you can take a ride in a federal car, and spend the rest of the day in a little room, answering federal questions. It's your call. Who are you?
I'm a full blood Oglala Sioux, born and raised on this reservation.
I'm a full blood Oglala Sioux, born and raised on this reservation.
You're a wise-ass. Ray check his wallet.
We got the wire ya was comin'. You're the Indian official, yeah?
No. No, that's Ray, here. Ray, uh... Ray... Little Weasel.
Leo's gotta get to burial, Brother. He's gotta make the journey.
What journey?
What journey?
Tell him, Ray.
-- an Indian Reservation is within the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Intimidation. I know that.
Good. Thank you.
Somebody must be doing something somewhere in your jurisdiction, Officer Crow Foot.
You ain't gonna cut his hands off and send 'em to Washinton, are ya? They done that to one of our girls once. Leo did quillwork, he's gonna need his hands.
Respect the dead, Hoss. Because when --
-- did you understand me when I said that --
-- did you understand me when I said that --
-- violation of the Major Crimes Act on an Indian Reservation is within the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Instigation. I know that.

Goodbye.
What the hell you doing?!
His mother needs a piece of his hair. It's for the Keeping of the Souls Ceremony. Has to be kept for four days.
South Dakota... Did I do something unsatisfactory, Sir?
No, Ray. You're gonna have to blame that on your grandmother.
I didn't know him, Sir. He passed away when I was six.
Seven.
Those are two agents who went into a reservation a few years ago to serve a warrant. They were executed at close range. That one there is a police officer killed by the Mohawks up in Canada more recently.
Jesus...
Jesus...
The agents who have worked out here say its like going into Nam. Unfamiliar terrain, foreign language, foreign customs... and you never know when you might walk into a few rounds. They hold a lot of old anger for the white man out here.
Were you in Nam?
Airborne. That's where they used to get us agents from. Now we get 'em from Carnegie-Melon, Ivy League. Accountants and computer whiz-kids. Yuppies with guns. That's scary shit.
Hey, hey, hey. J. Edgar would've loved you. He'd love anybody who joined the bureau to, what was it? "To enforce the laws of my country and protect her interests"?
You crashed my file?
You crashed my file?
No. I consulted it. We're going into Indian Country, I wanna know what kind of individual is covering my ass. Don't you?
Six rounds. 357.
That's what it looks like, doesn't it? But that's what a ten gauge, choke-bored, shotgun will look like when it hits your lower back from five feet away.
Somebody was serious about doing this guy, that's for sure.
Ray.
This is a restricted area.
Check him out, Ray.
I did.
Who the fuck is he?
Who the fuck is he?
-- a fucking cop.
Leo has to take the journey, Cooch.
We'll have to give Leo a refund. Because he's gotta go to the M.E. In case you don't know, Officer, violation of the Major Crimes Act on --
Leo's gonna need his hands, Cooch. He does quillwork.
I think Leo's retired from quillwork for the moment.
Keeping of the souls. Do they still burn their dead or something?
Beats the hell outta me.
No. That's Ray here. Ray...
Ray Levoi, Sir. Pleasure.
Water. Worth killing for out here, I'd think.
Get the plate numbers off everyone of these cars.

I already did.
Couldn't sleep.

Maisy Blue Legs place?
How'd you know?
How'd you know?
I got one up on ya.
I got one up on ya.
Go ahead.
Go ahead.
I've got the doer. I know who he is.
Meet me at base. Over.
Cooch. You're my hero.
Who is he?
One of the leaders of the Warriors of All Red Nations. Militant organization.
White eagle feather through the circle. That's their symbol.
That's right.
They obviously wanted it to be known that they offed Leo. Some kind of statement.
Jimmy Looks Twice put Leo's head through a glass door of the tribal offices three months ago. And threatened him several times since. President Clear Moon and the regional FBI feel he made good on that threat.
I'd just like five minutes alone with the motherfucker who hung that flag upside down.
Easy, Cowboy. No vendettas on my ship. Now: remember what I told you about Nam? Watch the grass, watch the trees, watch the shit house, be on your toes, and if we get committed, don't hesitate to empty that sucker.
Easy, Cowboy. No vendettas on my ship. Now: remember what I told you about Nam? Watch the grass, watch the trees, watch the shit house, be on your toes, and if we get committed, don't hesitate to empty that sucker.
Alright. Alright.
What'd she say?
She talks a lot of shit. We're not doing our job. Jimmy's innocent. "What's the FBI really doing here." Some shit about the Fort Laramie Treaty.
She took something from the house. What she called a medicine bundle. Most likely Jimmy's.
Let's see it.
Let's see it.
I gave it back to her.
That's good goddamn work, Ray. Let the salmon run. Let 'em run Upriver.
Why we setting Eagle Bear up as an informant?
Why we setting Eagle Bear up as an informant?
Her own people start to suspect her, it creates discord from within. The Warriors don't know who to trust, they start infighting, and Jimmy loses his support.
Her oil pan is shot.
Cooch. What's the Fort Laramie Treaty?
Cooch. What's the Fort Laramie Treaty?
Jesus, I don't know. You tell me. You're the Indian.
Cooch. Where the fuck did they send us?
A long way from home. You be careful out there.
The right man? Talk to me, Ray.
Whoever dusted Leo, dusted him from the driver's seat of a moving car then drove those eight miles to the Badlands. Jimmy Looks Twice has never been behind the wheel of a car. It's a known fact out here that he's petrified of driving. His parents were killed in a car wreck.
Genetic ditto on evidence found at the site with evidence you found in his belongings. An incontrovertible motive. And definite footprints on Jimmy Looks Twice at Maisy Blue Legs house.
When did we get that?
When did we get that?
Today. And now you -- there's a dog in the van --

You weren't sent here to go off on your own detail, Ray. You were sent here to assist in a Selective Operations Unit. These regional agents are inept -- that's why they were sent out here to The Graveyard, to Indian Country. I need you behind me, Ray. Not pulling against me.

Ray. I never get into bed with somebody unless I know for sure. Just the way I was raised.
Alright. Alright...
Yeah, alright, alright -- fuck you -- give a yuppie a badge and he wants to take over the world. Go get a tail on Eagle Bear, and stay with her. Cuz Jimmy's gonna show. And I want you to make the collar.
I'll sleep around a little.
Thanks, Cooch.
Thanks, Cooch.
And get rid of the dog.
Bastards...
All I could think of was... not here. I don't wanna eat it on an Indian Reservation, three thousand miles from home.

Yes.
And it was full of water when I drove by here three days ago. Full. I mean... a river.
The Little Walking River. You're right. This is part of it. So whoever sunk this car didn't compensate for drought. Goddamn.

-- never mind Eagle Bear. We've got Jimmy nailed. Let's go!
Listen: when we get back tomorrow, you're gonna find Tully laying a promotion on you. S.A.C. He wants to prove that his yuppie agents are making good. He's offering you New York. Tell him you want Atlanta.
Why?
Why?
Cuz I want New York.
You ever put your hands on me again and you'll be doing the books for a baitshop in the fucking Everglades, Mister.

What is it? It's genocide, that's what it is. It's a Pay Zone for some U.S. corporation and a Dead Zone for the people here. Uranium, Cooch.
This was a Selective Operations Unit, Agent Levoi. There is classified information pertaining to our national security. You don't question that, you don't go digging into that shit -- that's insubordination. Jesus Christ --
-- if they mine uranium there, these people will have no place left to go...
-- if they mine uranium there, these people will have no place left to go...

No. We neutralized enemies of the United States. Anti-American radicals who have killed federal officers out here!
Come on, Ray. Come forward.
No way, Cooch.
Ray...
Let the press through.
I said when can Leo be taken to ceremony?
After we've completed our investigation.
What are you --
Watch out!
What?!
You're steppin' on sign.
Hey. Hey, you, listen up --
-- Leo wasn't killed here. He was dumped here. Out of a vehicle. Bald tread. Muffler held on with baling wire.
Big sonuvabuck. Based on the depth of that print, pressure releases... I'd say he goes two-ten, two-fifteen --
Bullshit.
Bullshit.

Leo was killed right here.

Is that right? What are the trees saying today?
Is that right? What are the trees saying today?
They're sayin' that nobody's gonna talk to you cuz they don't give away one of their own. But they did say there's somebody way across the Little Walking River who wants to talk to you.
He sent me to find ya. He says he's got information.
Let's go.
Grandpa Samuel Reaches. Heavy duty medicine.
Medicine. As in medicine man?
Why does he wanna see me?
Good question. Hardly sees anybody anymore. Hasn't left this place in twenty years. Did you bring some tobacco?
What did he say?
He wants to know if you ever watch the Cookie Monster. He says the Cookie Monster is not to be trusted -- a trickster.
But he is not unhappy with you because he knows you.
He knows me?
He knows me?
He says he saw you in a vision some time ago.
What's he smoke in that?
Sacred herbs. Tobacco. Don't worry, we don't smoke no Mexican agriculture in The Pipe. That's a white man's myth. This is a sacrament.
What did he say?
He said he doesn't know.
He said he doesn't know.
He just did the Gettysburg Address in Sioux. What did he say?
What was he saying?
Why should I tell you.
Why should I tell you.
Because he was talking to me.
The old man saw an owl. Over there in the dry wash. Last week.
And...
And...
He saw an owl.
So what?
The owl is a messenger. When one shows itself to a Sioux... it means someone's gonna die. The owl told him about Leo.
The owl told him about Leo. That's incredible. I guess we just broke the back of this investigation, didn't we? Evidence doesn't get any harder than that -- not for my money. Is there anyway we can seduce this owl into Federal Court?
He also said "listen to the water."
He also said "listen to the water."
Listen to the water. Listen to the owl. He also said, don't trust the fucking Cookie Monster.
Listen to the water. Listen to the owl. He also said, don't trust the fucking Cookie Monster.
Go back to your DNA finger-printin'.
Don't be mad. That was just an old traditional gesture that means hello, how are you.
I see. Forgive my cultural ignorance.
Jimmy didn't do it, Ray. I checked it out. You can stop taggin' my sister.
She's your sister?
So did this one. Wambli is a rare and sacred creature. When someone finds a dead one, the feathers get around the res. We share everything. A lot of power in the eagle feathers. But you think that's bullshit too, don't --
-- Leo Fast Elk was sitting in the outhouse at Maisy Blue Legs when a car pulled into the yard. He came out, approached the vehicle then saw that the man behind the wheel was Jimmy. He tried to get back into the trailer, but the car came highballing at him. He started running for the open grass. With the car moving, Jimmy hung
Was-te. 'Cept for one thing. Jimmy Looks Twice was nowhere near there. Ya see, when Jimmy was twelve years old, his mother and father was killed in a car wreck right down there near Elk Mountain.
I don't see the connection.
I don't see the connection.
The connection is, it did a head number on him. He's petrified of cars. Won't drive. I've known him all my life, and he's never gotten behind the wheel of a vehicle. He rides passenger and he rides horses, and that's it. The man that shot Leo down was behind the wheel of a moving car.
That's not solid.
You want solid? That one, single, print he left in the Badlands -- the one the FBI missed and then stepped all over -- it belongs to a man who walks heels first. Like a white man. Jimmy has a serious Ind'n walk -- ball of the foot first. The man who murdered Leo walked like a Wasi'cu.
The old man? He's gonna tell you who killed Leo?
Go catch Jimmy, Ray. Really. He's gettin' away. Go ahead, go get him. I'm late.
Go catch Jimmy, Ray. Really. He's gettin' away. Go ahead, go get him. I'm late.

Red Deer Table, Ray.
Don't tell me: heavy duty.
Don't tell me: heavy duty.
Heavy, heavy duty. Taku Wakan. Wanagi Spirits. It's one of those few places we'd never go to as kids. Still don't. Some of the old people say Crazy Horse is buried back there. We have to go Ray. Together. Like his vision.
Walter. When I fill out my 302, do I say that evil spirits are killing everybody on the reservation?
Ray --
Ray --
-- no. No offense to the old man. I appreciate you trying to help. But I put my ass on the line coming out here, man.

Jesus Christ. You're hammered. What are you doing?
Jesus Christ. You're hammered. What are you doing?
You're right about the old man. His power's long dried up. He's supposed to be a medicine man but he won't go see the people. He says we changed, and we don't listen. Well, he don't go out and talk no more. I haven't had a drink in three years but I just turned my sobriety chip into that man behind the bar, and

Still after Jimmy?
They found prints at Blue Legs' place.
They found prints at Blue Legs' place.
Yeah. Jimmy's prints are there. But they cross over Benjamin Black Star's prints. And he wasn't there until six o'clock the mornin' after to get eggs from the chickens. So Jimmy wasn't there til the next day. Follow?
Next time I'll be ready. You get the word to who ever it is.
I can't, Hoss. I don't talk to FBI's.
You think you was sent here cuz you're a good cop?
No. I was sent here cuz I'm Indian. And a good cop.

Why? So you can get rid of me, too?
No. So we can do what the old man said. Red Deer Table, Walter. We have to go.
Do they come in dreams, these visions?
Oh yeah. Dreams. Sometimes durin' sickness. Vision quest. Sweat Lodge. Ya never know when.
Oh yeah. Dreams. Sometimes durin' sickness. Vision quest. Sweat Lodge. Ya never know when.
Just before we caught Jimmy... I had a dream that I was being chased. And I was running with other people. Old- fashion Indian people. I got shot in the back. Like Leo.
Where was this?
At Wounded Knee. I mean, that's where I was, and that's where the dream was. Why?
At Wounded Knee. I mean, that's where I was, and that's where the dream was. Why?

Nothin'. Forget it.
You had a vision. You had yourself a vision. A man waits a long time for a vision. Might go his whole lifetime and never get one. And along comes some instant Indian with a Mastercard and brand-new shoes, has himself a vision.
Sorry.
Sorry.

Alright. Shit's comin' down. He's callin' council fire. All the old chiefs and the warriors, too. I gotta be at Grandpa's place in two hours. We need to get the tribe together. We need to block this thing.
What we need... is Richard Yellow Bird.
I thought it was a rare case of a brother getting a break in the courts. We did an honorin' song for him and everything.
He's looking at a few hundred years in Leavenworth. He's not gonna come out without a fight.
Ray. Ray, don't let go now, Man. Ray...
You go to the council fire. I'm going back in.

He hasn't left this place in twenty years. They got him.
They got us sealed. What are we gonna do?
We're going for The Stronghold.
That's it. The Stronghold. Get us in there, we got a chance.
We're in there. We're in there --

Some Indian time?
I'll have to see what the visions say about that one.
You didn't have another vision...
You take care.
If you ever need a place to come back to and listen to the trees a little... we'll be here.
You're the Indian FBI.
That's right. Turn around.

Look. You and I can stand here in a culture clash til the sun comes up, talking about what's right and what's wrong. You're from the reservation. It's a different world.
I'm from Minneapolis. Fifth Street. I did four years at Dartmouth before I ever set foot on this res. So I know about the other world, Ray.
Thank you.
When you see Jimmy, tell him the sooner he turns himself back into a human being and gives himself in... the sooner we back off this reservation. Okay?
Grandpa Reaches says you come from heavy Indian blood. I used to think Grandpa was gettin' senile. Now I know he is.
Move it, Magdelana.
You burned an American flag today. And left it for me...
-- You desecrated it, it had to be burned.
-- You desecrated it, it had to be burned.
I desecrated it?

You forced an innocent man to run like an animal. You've tried to poison my people's hearts against me with your manipulation, with letters I never wrote... you've been watching me eat, work, raise my family... wash myself in the river. And now you're here, arresting me at a sacred place. In your eyes, that's power.
Your relatives must've taught you something.
NO. My father never told anybody he had Indian blood. But he still used a few Indian words around the house. He called me Washee. Said it meant... good boy.
What?
Wa-shee is like... a dumpling. Like tallow we put in stew. I think he was calling you chubby boy.

I'm starting to sense that now.
Let's make it at eight.
Make what?
Make what?
Anything.
Anything.
Okay, anything. Just...go. I've gotta work.
Why'd you do that?

It dies. We live.
You're an animal.
You're an animal.
That's true. What are you?

I don't enjoy watching things suffer.
No!
It's not suffering anymore.
It's not suffering anymore.
You're horrible
You're horrible
You're not, cause you eat frozen meatballs? Things die. Every time you breathe, you kill millions of tiny organisms. Every time you eat, something had to die.

You ever think about killing another human being?
You ever think about killing another human being?
About as much as they think about killing me.
Does it bother you?
They know the rules... That's the deal. That's why you're up there. It's him or me. That's the price of admission. It bothers you, why? You're part of it. Everybody dies. Most people don't get to die for something.
You know what really scares me? Living too long. Losing my hair and my teeth...and my guts and my wind. And my brains...Sitting in a room with my hands in my lap, watching daytime TV.
You don't believe any of this. You don't think you'll ever die.
You don't believe any of this. You don't think you'll ever die.
That's it, of course. When I'm up there and doing it, I'm cheating it every second. I'm subverting all laws...gravity...whatever. I'm skating the edge of it.

What he said..."There's nothing so exhilarating as being shot at without result."
All you've got is one life. I guess it's worth about the same to every body. You ever see an old woman after her husband has died? And the meaningless years of decline stretch ahead... When you're in the air and doing something really dangerous, you can look ahead... maybe ten seconds. That's your whole future. That's as far as it goes. But imagine

What if you kill yourself? Think of everything you'll miss. MAVERICK There is lots of stuff I don't know about... Fine wine... great art... the opera. I guess if I live long enough, I'll get to it. If I don't, I'll never miss it.

Are you really that brave?
Are you really that brave?
I watched my mother die. Cancer. She had a long time to think about it. They say you reach an agreement with death. Come to accept the fact that pretty soon you won't be here. I didn't see that. She... was very brave...braver than I am. You go up there, there isn't time to think. If you make a mistake, you're just a smudge

You're totally insane.
Thanks very much. Care for some suchi?.
Come on.
Where?

You want to go ballistic?
You want to go ballistic?
I don't know. I don't like being out of control.
I always wanted to fly... ever since I first saw a jet. I wanted to fly jets, then I wanted F-14's, then I wanted to fly off carriers, then I wanted Top Gun.
And now?
And now?
And now I want you.
And now I want you.
You always get what you want?

I don't know yet.

Not to me.

You knew it. You all do. It's part of it. Maybe the most important part.
Where are we?
Where are we? You know where we are. It's called the beach. It's where life first crawled up out of the sea. I come here sometimes... when I feel like crawling back in.

Yesterday.
You look way out there. Out past the date line. West becomes East, all things change. You cross the line...today becomes yesterday...or tomorrow, I forget which.
That's what I want.
That's what I want.
Of course the line's just imaginary. You can cross it twenty times...nothing really changes.
You don't believe that.
Hardly ever.

Only when you're depressed. Then it passes.

I sit. I think. I play games.

I like to play "reality".
How do you play reality.
It's strip reality, actually, like what the pilots always want to play.

Strip reality! How do you play that?
Strip reality! How do you play that?
It's like strip poker, only, without the bluffing. One person says something and if the other one accepts that it's true, the one who says it, gets to take one item of clothing off.

You're crazy. That's a pretty silly game.
You're crazy. That's a pretty silly game.
Not as silly as some. You know the silliest one? ...that we are gods. That we control events on the beach... that we can turn back time...
Want to play the game?
How does it go?

You say the truth. Go ahead. Don't be afraid. You want to win the game, don'tcha?

Take something off.
Take something off.
Off me or off you?
Off me or off you?
That's up to you.
What does it mean?
That wasn't fair. It was a question. Penalty round!
You didn't mean it. You didn't think. You'd do anything to take it back.
That's three.
That's three.
And that's one!
One more.
Your watch.
Looks like a tie.
Who's gonna win?
Who's gonna win?
We'll say it together. On the count of three...One...two...
You weren't gonna say goodbye?
I was, later.

I know exactly what you mean.

How could you?
How could you?
I've got a gift just like you do. My gift is I just know what people mean, even if they can't say it. It helps when you're trying to communicate with fighter pilots. Like what you just said was "I'm embarrassed, I feel I've done something wrong, that I've failed, and I don't think I can live up to the expectations of a wonderful

And I'm gonna sneak off, and be by myself for awhile, like until I can think of a new career...hotel management or something...
Big talk for someone who's never been shot off her computer.
Big talk for someone who's never been shot off her computer.
Hey, I never said I was a fighter pilot...I never claimed to think it was fun to be shot off the end of a ship in a storm. I can find contentment in a good book. I don't have to roar by someone at Mach two with my hair on fire. Sometimes...I just get happy being with the right man.

I hope you find him.
I hope you find him.
I think I have... I could be wrong. I have been before. Just remember one thing. If you're not Top Gun, if you're not fighting jets, you're not gonna be able to act like a fighter pilot... You're gonna have to act like the rest of us. You're gonna have to master humility. For you guys, that's the toughest maneuver of all.
Well?
Well what?
Well what?
You got your F-14, you got Top Gun, you got your MiGs....You're our new Top Gun instructor...Now what?

Right on the flight line?
Well... What is it?
Sir. You are going to give me a warning, Sir!
Yes sir. I do, Sir.

NO JOKE, COUGAR. ON THE LEVEL. EVEN I WOULDN'T DO THAT TO YOU.
I'M UPSIDE DOWN. I KNOW IT. I'M GONNA EJECT.
I've got a six strobe. I think he's locked on us.
It's a MiG 21. They don't have radar missiles!

Let's hope you're right!

What is he doing?

He's pissing me off!
That's missile lock!
He better be kidding!
He better be kidding!
Lordy! Eyeball to Asshole. Hope nobody burps!
We're locked on MiG ONE. Why doesn't he disengage?
These guys are getting on my nerves.
Hey, if it was easy, everybody would want to come up here and do it..... Instead of just us.
You.
Help me with this one, I'm really screwed up.
Bring it left. Bring it left, You're high.
Bring it left. Bring it left, You're high.

We're not! Trust me! We're okay.
I'm pulling up.
No! Now we're inverted!
We're on vapor, Cougar, you got to put it down.
It's crazy, man. Instruments are crazy. We're gonna have to eject.
It's crazy, man. Instruments are crazy. We're gonna have to eject.
TELL HIM, WILL YOU TELL HIM? OUR INSTRUMENTS ARE OKAY.
OKAY... OKAY. BUT IF I LAND THIS THING UPSIDE DOWN. AND I LIVE. I'LL HAVE YOUR BUTT!
You'll have mine, Cougar. It'll be where your head used to be.
WHAT? WHERE'RE YOU--HEY, WHERE IN THE HELL ARE YOU GOING?
DIDN'T ... AHHH...LOOK GOOD.
DIDN'T ... AHHH...LOOK GOOD.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN? IT DOESN'T GET TO LOOK MUCH BETTER THAN THAT?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN? IT DOESN'T GET TO LOOK MUCH BETTER THAN THAT?
NO. NO GOOD.
What are you doing?
Saving them some paperwork.
Saving them some paperwork.
Since when did you care about paperwork?
If I could fly like you I'd have everything I want. If I could fly at all. I can't fly. I can't fly like that. Nobody can. Whatever it is, you've got it!
Not anymore.
Not anymore.
So, you're scared--so what? You ever get a good look at me in the back seat, I'm goddamn terrified.
Bandit at seven o'clock low--solo. Take him. Pull on the goddamn stick, man!
Okay, okay.
Okay, okay.
Don't tell me okay. Do it!
BREAK LEFT! BREAK LEFT! CHAFF! FLARES!
BREAKING LEFT!
THERE'S ANOTHER ONE UP THERE!
I GOT ONE COMING UP.
I GOT ONE COMING UP.
AND HE'S GUNNING.
Ohhh Mother!
Goddamnit, Mav, you really are a slow learner. Don't worry, Fung, I've got it.
Don't WORRY!!!? You've GOT it!!? Are you CRAZY?
Roger, I've got it.
Now have you got it? Have you still got it?
Yawing right.

Okay.
No! Not again!
What are you talking about, we gotta go!

I'm not losing it again!
Gotta go, man.
280, 290, 300 knots.

You go. I'm staying with it.
You go. I'm staying with it.
I'm gonna go! THREE...TWO...ONE...
Is there something I should know?
Just relax.
Just relax.
Is it the plane?
Is it the plane?
The plane is fine.
The plane is fine.
Is it you?
Is it you?
Yeah, I guess it is. We did it! We did it...Damn! We sure did it!
You're not supposed to...
But I have to!
But I have to!
Then...shit! Go ahead. I'm right behind you.
Then...shit! Go ahead. I'm right behind you.
MUSTANG, THIS IS MAVERICK, REQUEST A FLYBY.
You hear that? Anything we want. Anything...Well???
Well what?
Well what?
What do you want?
What do you want?
What do I want?
What do I want?
What do you want?
What do you want?
Any more MiGs?
Let me do the talking.
Oh, no. You did the flying, I'll do the talking!
Why do you all have such funny names?
You gotta have a call sign that's just your own...never changes...you have to recognize it immediately. Then, if someone shouts "Wolf, break left!"..you react right away.
You gotta have a call sign that's just your own...never changes...you have to recognize it immediately. Then, if someone shouts "Wolf, break left!"..you react right away.
Why do they call you Wolf?
Well, I don't know. That depends.
On what?
On what?
Well, it doesn't just happen, you gotta do something famous.
Well, it doesn't just happen, you gotta do something famous.
Like what?
Like what?
Oh...I'll think of something.
It's not Cougar's place. It's ours.
What do you think it was? Was it that MiG contact that did it?
What do you think it was? Was it that MiG contact that did it?
Did what?
Did what?
Got you here.
Got you here.
We're here because we're the best flyers in the wing. Not because of some MiG encounter.
That's not what I heard.
We won! Ice turns back, stares them down, then turns back into his locker, dismissing them.
We won! Ice turns back, stares them down, then turns back into his locker, dismissing them.
Below the hard deck doesn't count. You guys are the second team, aren't you?
Slider -- they let you into Top Gun? If you're among the best in the Navy, I tremble for the security of this country.
Why Goose, whose butt did you kiss to get here?

So's my Johnson.
So's my Johnson.
This is Maverick.
So I've heard.
Who's your pilot?
Who's your pilot?
Tom Kazansky.
Tom Kazansky.
No shit. The Iceman....
No shit. The Iceman....
Mister to you.
You think you can stay up with us.
I think, yeah, we'll show you a thing or two.
I think, yeah, we'll show you a thing or two.
This is Evan Mitchell, he steers the thing.
This is Evan Mitchell, he steers the thing.
So I heard. Steers it pretty close. Sorry to hear about Cougar. He was a good man.
What was that?
Flaming Hooker. Sort of an institution around here. Or maybe this is the institution, I forget which. It's the house drink. It'll warm the cockles of your heart ... and other things depending on where you spill it.
How was it?
Could use a dash more jet fuel.
Nice. Always a good idea to show up your instructors. He nods toward Jester, glaring at them from his A4. Goose indicates the backseat of the Tomcat.
Hey, see any controls back there? And anyway...we beat the Son of a Bitch!
Look at the weather! They'll never find us! We're near out of fuel. Put it down.
COUGAR, YOU'RE ON THE BALL.
What are you doing?
Nothing...That's McGown...that's Singer, isn't it? GOOSE Turn around, pay attention. What are you doing?
Keller, Black Lion Squadron. I knew him at Pensacola. He's damn good.
Is there anybody in the Navy you don't know?
Is there anybody in the Navy you don't know?
Gotta keep track of the competition.
You ever done this before?
What, been drunk? Sure! Plenty!
Hey Mav, this is Sally. She doesn't believe a word I say. Tell her I'm married, will you?
Yeah, he's married--but then again, he,s not dead.
What do these guys think, I made Cougar quit?
Pay no attention to it. They're just trying to rattle you. It's all psychological. Sit down..and drink.
I've lost him -- where is he?
On your six -- coming hard. Four hundred. Losing airspeed! He's on your six and closing fast! Hard left! HARD LEFT!
Great move. Great
He should've had me. GOOSE Take it down. Let's bug out of here. Call for a draw.
We did it!
Look, Ma, top of the world!
Ahhh...A little high on the left, don't you think?
Right.
It's a victory roll.
I wouldn't call it victory. It's more like...self immolation.
Hi...Hi there. How ya doing in there? Mav... Ahhh...you know, at one point I did want a Navy career.
Come on, relax...
Come on, relax...
You see all those guys with gold on their shoulders!!?... Oh, no, I think that was Johnson, Air Boss of the Kitty Hawk!
You see all those guys with gold on their shoulders!!?... Oh, no, I think that was Johnson, Air Boss of the Kitty Hawk!
Come on, we beat an instructor. How many times in your life do you get to do a victory roll?
Come on, we beat an instructor. How many times in your life do you get to do a victory roll?
Just once, if they take your plane away.
Come on, we're next.
What?
What?
Come on, I got over six bucks on the line.
Come on, come on! It's double or nothing.. We're talking twelve bucks American, here.
I've had enough...for now.
What the hell is this?
Don't chew it, you won't have it that long. Easier to clean the cockpit if it comes up in big chunks.
Something bothering you?
Nothing. Let's just go fight.
STAY WITH HIM! TIGHTEN YOUR TURN!
Bogey at three o'clock high! Nose on!
Just cover Wood, Maverick. Mutual support, man!
I'm gonna take him, Goose.
I'm gonna take him, Goose.
Don't be greedy. Stay with Wood.
Don't be greedy. Stay with Wood.
I want him!
What what are you doing? We're cover!
Wood's okay. I want Viper.
Relationships are a bitch, here. It's hard enough to concentrate ...under the pressure. Having a woman here is asking for it.
I guess that's what I'm doing, then.
I guess that's what I'm doing, then.
Where do you find the time? Where do you find the energy. It's tough enough to keep your mind on school. A woman here is a real pain in the...
I'm pinned to the panel.
Time to go.
Time to go.
I can't eject.
3000 feet. I'll do it.
Go ahead. I can't reach. 2000 feet!
1000.
Let's go. Eject.
That's Kazanski.
No shit! That why they call him Ice?
No shit! That why they call him Ice?
Nope. It's the way he flies - Ice cold. No mistakes. Wears you down. After enough time, you just get bored and frustrated, you do something stupid, and he's got you.
Man, you guys gooned it. Your laser butts are scattered across KANSAS.
Come on. I died enough for one night.
I was a victim of circumstance.
They should have warned you about that one.
They should have warned you about that one.
She's kinky for flight suits--said that she'd never seen so many zippers--played with them all night. The noise alone kept me up.
She's kinky for flight suits--said that she'd never seen so many zippers--played with them all night. The noise alone kept me up.
What'd you do?
What'd you do?
Pulled left, rolled out, underneath.
Don't worry. I'll talk to him.
Don't.
He's the best you have. He's going Top Gun!
Was.
Well, he's going and he needs someone to fly the plane.
Skipper, you can't do this!
Skipper, you can't do this!
I didn't do it, he did it himself. Something about a wife and kid. The fact is, he's lost it. He knows it. I know it. You were up there, you know it, too. GOOSE Give him a break, Skipper. It was raining snakes up there. He'll be alright, soon as all the gorillas go home...
But, Skipper, Cougar's been picked for Top Gun...He's the best of the best!
Well, you'll just have to make do with him .
Mav's a great flyer but....
He's a hell of a flyer. In fact, he's so damn good he might have been picked for Top Gun himself. Except for one thing. He just can't seem to follow orders!
A plaque?
It's not the plaque. The winner can get assigned here as instructor. He gets to fight every day.
No, we...got our butts kicked.
Thirty seconds. That's all it took to blow us out of the sky.
It's kind of ironic. All you guys have women troubles and I don't.
That's because you don't have any women.
That's because you don't have any women.
Until last night. Did you see the moves I was making on that girl at the party?
Until last night. Did you see the moves I was making on that girl at the party?
The girl with the purple fingernails?
The girl with the purple fingernails?
That's her--tall hungry woman with fire in her eyes. It was great.
Coogan spent half the night looking for her. He said he was gonna kill the son-of-a-bitch who ruined his sister.
I didn't ruin her.
Hear about Ice?
What now?
What now?
He won again.
I'VE GOT TWO MORE BOGEYS COMING IN AT FOUR O'CLOCK HIGH.
GOT 'EM.

OKAY, GOING UP. ICE, GO HIGH.
LOOK OUT!

I CAN'T LOSE HIM, CAN YOU GET OFF A SHOT?
I GOT NO TONE. IT MIGHT GET YOU.
I GOT NO TONE. IT MIGHT GET YOU.
WHAT CHOICE DO I HAVE? SHOOT IT.
WHAT CHOICE DO I HAVE? SHOOT IT.
WHEN I SHOOT, YOU BREAK LEFT..3..2
I guess I owe you one.
You don't owe me anything. We're on the same team.
You don't owe me anything. We're on the same team.
You saved our lives. You did it!
You saved our lives. You did it!
We did it.
We did it.
You're a hell of a flyer. You can be my wingman any time.
You're a hell of a flyer. You can be my wingman any time.
No. You can be mine!
Figured it out yet?
Figured out what?
Figured out what?
Who is the best.
Who is the best.
Nope.
Nope.
Need a hint?
Need a hint?
I think I can work it out on my own.
I think I can work it out on my own.
You like to work alone. I've heard that about you.
You like to work alone. I've heard that about you.
I've heard of you, too. You were in 124 with Bargamian.
I've heard of you, too. You were in 124 with Bargamian.
And you were with Cougar. He was my roommate in flight school.
The hard deck for this hop was ten thousand feet. Jester, at what point did you call off the fight?
Just below ten thousand.
Just below ten thousand.
But you continued to fight.
I don't know what to tell you, Skip.
Tell me one thing.
He's seat of the pants... Completely unpredictable -- nothing by the book. All over the sky. But I don't know, Skip, he's really got something.
Yeah, we get one of these guys every damn class. "Maverick!"
WALKED RIGHT INTO IT.
NOT ONLY THAT, BUT ZORRO GOT YOUR WINGMAN. NICE GOING.
He just won't engage. He can't do it, Skipper. He can't get back on the horse.
It's only been a week. Keep sending him up.
It's only been a week. Keep sending him up.
I've seen this before.
I've seen this before.
So have I.
So have I.
Some guys never get it back.
Who's the hell is that?
Three guesses.
Three guesses.
Well, he's in trouble and he didn't even get here yet.
Ah, the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat.
Speaking of feet, fuel's down to 4.0. We're gonna get them wet unless we find a Sonoco station.

COUGAR, THIS IS MAVERICK. I'M GETTING HUNGRY, LET'S HEAD FOR THE BARN. ...COUGAR, WHERE ARE YOU?
I...FORGOT SOMETHING.
What the hell you doing?
What the hell you doing?
Helping him in.
Helping him in.
What makes you think we can get back in? We don't have the fuel for this. MAVERICK Just get me to him.
You won?!!!
Didn't everybody?
It was bad.
Bad?
Bad?
The girl with the purple fingernails was Coogan's sister.
You didn't help.
No, really. She came ruined!... Ya think he knows it was me?
Morning, Coogan.
How's it goin', Coog?
He's a good pilot.
I talked a man back once. Three months later, we lost him. It's his decision. Only he knows.
Was going. Now you are.
Me?
You just did an incredibly brave thing! What you should have done was land your plane. You don't own that plane, the taxpayers do. I should ream you out for it. But it just doesn't work with you. You're a hell of a flyer. You are maybe ...too good. You never really stepped in it yet. So this is your chance. I'm gonna send
Sir?
Sir?
That is all. Tell me about the MiG some other time...
That is all. Tell me about the MiG some other time...
Yes sir!
Yes sir..
The wings..
Considering the company you're in, that's a pretty arrogant attitude.
Yes sir.
Yes sir.
I like that in a fighter pilot. It's okay to be confident. You have to think you're King Kong to want to try to land on carriers. Just keep in mind the other component of success...teamwork.
Maverick... Where'd you get that call sign?
Ahhh... Runs in the family, sir.
Ahhh... Runs in the family, sir.
You're father was Marvin Mitchell..
You're father was Marvin Mitchell..
Yes sir.
Yes sir.
A good man. Good flyer.
I had him in view. I was peeling over the egg, into a dive. He saw me when I moved in for the kill. There wasn't any danger...
Is that how you remember it?
Why?
We weren't below for more than ten seconds. There was no danger. I had the shot. I took it.
We weren't below for more than ten seconds. There was no danger. I had the shot. I took it.
The rules of engagement are not flexible. They exist for your safety. You will obey them. Is that clear?
I wasn't thinking. I just did it.
Big gamble with a thirty million dollar plane!
SNAPSHOT..MISSED HIM..
ENGAGING THE OTHER GUY. WOOD, YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.
Twenty years' experience, I couldn't shake you. You may be a great flyer. I mean that.
I lost.
I lost.
Of course you did. I said a great flyer, not a smart one. You fly reckless. Great instincts. No discipline. That ambush today, you followed your emotions instead of your wingman. Of course you got killed...and well deserved to. It was a really stupid mistake. In battle, it gets people killed.
I can take care of myself.
Talent is no holy shield. Von Richtofen was killed by a farm boy. Instincts are not enough. Do it our way. We've worked these things out. The good pilots can become better and the great ones can learn how to stay alive. Why do you have to do everything the hard way?

It's my own way. It works for me. I don't care about the rest of that stuff.
It's my own way. It works for me. I don't care about the rest of that stuff.
Then why are you here?
Then why are you here?
For the same reason you are.
For the same reason you are.
Oh, you mean the thrill!
Oh, you mean the thrill!
The flying. The fighting. I'd go up there ten times a day to fight. I'd win at least nine of them. That's all I want to do. It's what I do best. I am real good. Just give me the jet.
How do you feel?
All right.
All right.
Goose is dead.
Goose is dead.
I know. I was there.
He was...my responsibility--my RIO.
My first squadron in Vietnam, we lost eight out of eighteen planes. Ten guys. The first one kills you, but there'll be others--you can count on it.
Skipper, sorry to bother you.
No bother.
No bother.
I called your house.
I called your house.
My wife's house.
My wife's house.
She said you took your kid to the each. Every second Sunday. Zoo or beach or the ballgame. Y'have the option... What about me?
We can send you back to your squadron with nothing noted on your record except "CNC" --course not completed, no explanation required. Theoretically, it doesn't hurt your career, but people always wonder about things like that.
Or....
Or....
Or you can quit.
Or you can quit.
I don't know...
I don't know...
I didn't know either. That's why I told Jester to prepare your papers.
It's no disgrace, kid. That spin was hell. It would wreck anyone's confidence. You could be a good pilot again someday...
You think I should quit?!
You think I should quit?!
I didn't say that. That's up to you. But I have responsibility for the other guys up there, not just you. They need to know you're all right...that they can depend on you.
Sometimes it's luck, but in this case, he earned it... I served with your old man.
I know.
I know.
VF 51, the Oriskany. You remind me of him. You're just like he was, only better...and worse.

You may not think so, but you are.

He was by the book, all the way.

They waved him off. He thought he knew better. He hit the ramp.

I never heard that.

Not something they tell dependents.
Not something they tell dependents.
It's not true.
How can I go on? I feel so... responsible.
Kid, the plain fact is...you are. I'm not gonna stand here and blow sunshine up your ass. Technically, they absolved you. You and I know what really happened. You pushed it. You are responsible and you'll always carry that. You know what, I'll carry it too. I should have taken you out of that cockpit. I guess I'm a hopeless romantic... I always try

You think I shouldn't fly.
You think I shouldn't fly.
I didn't say that. That's up to you. I think that if you do, if you choose to come back, you'll be a better pilot... a better man.
I didn't say that. That's up to you. I think that if you do, if you choose to come back, you'll be a better pilot... a better man.
Would you take me back? Would they?
Would you take me back? Would they?
I'll have to think about it. I don't know about them. I do know one thing, We've got a lot invested in you. We'd hate to lose it. Even more than those other guys, Naval Aviation needs a very few, very good men.
What's wrong with this one?
He ain't got five kids to feed.
Where's yours?
Over there man.
Over there man.
You got the job.
Welcome to Mars.
What was that? An accident?
What to the rebels want?
Oh, the usual. More money, more freedom, more air.
So, where to?
The Last Resort.
The Last Resort.
You're getting off to an early start.
First time on Mars?
Yeah...Well, actually no...Sort of.
Yeah...Well, actually no...Sort of.
Man don't know if he's been to Mars or not
Tell me something; are all psychics, uh....?
Freaks?...'Fraid so, man. Goes with the territory.
Freaks?...'Fraid so, man. Goes with the territory.
What happened to them?
What happened to them?
Cheap domes. And no air to screen out the rays.
Well, there it is; the Last Resort. Sure you wanna go in?
Why not?
Why not?
I know a much better place down the block -- the girls are clean; the liquor ain't watered down...
I know a much better place down the block -- the girls are clean; the liquor ain't watered down...
And you get a kickback.
Lemme ask you a question. Ever fuck a mutant?
Take me to the hotel.
What happened to number five?
Ah, shit. You got me. I ain't even married. Now put your fucking hands in the air!
Need a ride?
The Last Resort! Quick!
Shut up and drive!
Whatcha doin' to me, man?! I got six kids to feed!
And if you wanna breathe, you gotta but his air.
But maybe you can change all that.
But maybe you can change all that.
I think my grampa might be here.
How could you do this? You're a mutant.
Hey, I got four kids to feed.
What do you want?
They've got you bugged, and they'll be busting down the door in about three minutes unless you do exactly what I say.
Don't bother looking. It's in your skull.
Who are you?
Who are you?
Never mind. Wet a towel and wrap it around your head. That'll muffle the signal.
Never mind. Wet a towel and wrap it around your head. That'll muffle the signal.
How'd you find me?
How'd you find me?
I'd advise you to hurry.
Nice to have you back with us, Mr. Brubaker.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Would you like the same suite?
Would you like the same suite?
Definitely.
Hmm. It seems you left something in our safe.
Get it, please.
Get it, please.
Identification?
I'll go encode your room key.
Thank you.
There you go, Mr. Brubaker. Suite 610 in the East Wing.
May I use your pen?
Well, my boy, you're a hero.
Fuck you.
Fuck you.
Don't be modest. Kuato's dead; the Resistance has been completely wiped out; and you were the key to the whole thing.
You see, Quaid, none of my people could get close to Kuato. The fucking mutants could always sniff us out. So Hauser and I sat down and invented you: the perfect mole.
He's lying. Hauser turned against you.
He's lying. Hauser turned against you.
That's what we wanted you to think. The fact is, Hauser volunteered to become Doug Quaid. It was the only way to fool the psychics.

Get your story straight. This idiot's been trying to kill me since I went to Rekall. --You don't kill somebody you're trying to plant.

He wasn't in on it. You set him off by going to Rekall.
He wasn't in on it. You set him off by going to Rekall.
So why am I still alive?
So why am I still alive?
We gave you lots of help. Benny here...
The guy with the suitcase; the mask; the money; the message form Hauser...All of that was set up by us.
Sorry. Too perfect.
Sorry. Too perfect.
Perfect, my ass! --You pop your memory cap before we can activate you. Then Richter goes hod wild, screwing up everything I spent a year planning. --Frankly, I'm amazed is worked.
Well, Cohaagen, I have to hand it to you...This is the best mindfuck yet.
Don't take my word for it, Quaid. Someone you trust wants to talk to you.
Don't take my word for it, Quaid. Someone you trust wants to talk to you.
Who is it this time--my mother?
The guy's a fucking asshole.
Not true, he's one of my best friends...He's got a big house and a Mercedes. And you like Melina, right? Well, you'll get to fuck her every night.--That's right. She's gonna be Hauser's babe.
Come on, Cohaagen! You got what you want. Give these people air!
My friend, five minutes from now, you won't give a shit about the people. Fire it up, Doc.
What are you afraid of? Turn it on.
Impossible. Once the reaction starts, it'll spread to all the turbinium in the planet. Mars will go into global meltdown.--That's why the aliens never turned it on.

Do you expect me to believe you?
Do you expect me to believe you?
Who gives a shit what you believe? In thirty seconds, you'll be dead. Then I'll blow this place up...
I didn't want it to end this way. I wanted Hauser back. But nooo. You had to be Quaid.
I am Quaid.
I am Quaid.
You're nothing! You're nobody! You're a stupid dream. Well all dreams come to an end.
What the fuck is going on down there?!
I'm trying to neutralize a traitor.
I'm trying to neutralize a traitor.
If I wanted him dead, you moron, I wouldn't have dumped him on Earth.

We can't let him run around. He knows too much.
We can't let him run around. He knows too much.
Lori says he can't remember jack shit!
Lori says he can't remember jack shit!
That's now. In an hour, he could have total recall.
That's now. In an hour, he could have total recall.
Listen to me, Richter, I want Quaid delivered alive for re-implantation. Have you got that? I want him back in place with Lori.
Richter, do you know why I'm such a happy person?
No, sir.
No, sir.
Because I've got the greatest job in the solar system. As long as the turbinium keeps flowing, I can do anything I want. Anything. If fact, the only thing I ever worry about is that one day, if the rebels win, it all might end.
He had help. From our side, sir.
I know that.
I know that.
But I thought...
But I thought...
Who told you to think?! I don't give you enough information to think! You do what you're told!! That's what you do!
Who told you to think?! I don't give you enough information to think! You do what you're told!! That's what you do!
Yes, sir.
Now let's get down to business. Kuato wants what's in Quaid's head. And he might be able to get it, cause they say he's psychic. Now I have a little plan to keep this from happening. --Do you think you can play along?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Great! Because, otherwise I'll erase your ass.
Stop fighting and get out.
They've got Quaid! They're protecting him!
They've got Quaid! They're protecting him!
Perfect!...Get out of Sector G. Now. Don't think. Do it.
Perfect!...Get out of Sector G. Now. Don't think. Do it.
Yes, sir.
I say we throw the switch and see what happens.
Don't be an idiot.
Kill him.
It's about goddamn time.
Bob?
What is it?
What is it?
You better get down here.
I'm with an very important client.
Looks like another schizoid embolism.
What the fuck is going on here?! You can't install a simple goddamn double implant?!
It's not my fault. We hit a memory cap.
Listen to me! He's been going on and on about Mars. He's really been there.
Use your head, you dumb bitch! He's acting out the secret agent role from his Ego Trip!
Use your head, you dumb bitch! He's acting out the secret agent role from his Ego Trip!
I'm afraid that's not possible.
I'm afraid that's not possible.
Why not?
Why not?
We haven't implanted it yet.
Oh shit....Oh shit...
I've been trying to tell you. Someone erased his memory.
Okay, this is what we're gonna do. Renata, cover up any memory he has of us or Rekall.
I'll do what I can. It's getting messy in there.
I'll do what I can. It's getting messy in there.
Ernie, dump him in a cab. Around the corner. Tiffany, you help him. I'll destroy his file and refund his money. And if anybody comes asking...we've never heard of Douglas Quaid.

Come on...put his head in place.
Good evening... Doug. I'm Dr. Lull.
Nice to meet you.
Two-headed monsters?
Don't you keep up with the news? We're doing alien artifacts now.
So, been married long?
Eight years.
Eight years.
I see. Slipping away for a little hanky-panky.
I see. Slipping away for a little hanky-panky.
Not really. I've just always been fascinated by Mars.
Your sexual orientation?
Hetero.
Hetero.
Hmmm. And how do you like your women?
Blonde, brunette, redhead?
Brunette.
Brunette.
Slim, athletic, voluptuous?
Demure, aggressive, sleazy? Be honest.
Sleazy...and demure.
Sleazy...and demure.
Forty-one A, Ernie.
What do you want?
This is going to be very difficult for you at accept, Mr. Quaid.
This is going to be very difficult for you at accept, Mr. Quaid.
I'm listening.
I'm listening.
I'm afraid you're not really standing here right now.
Ya know, Doc, you could have folled me.
I'm quite serious. You're not here, and neither am I.
Amazing. Where are we?
At Rekall.
You're strapped into an implant chair, and I'm monitoring you at a psycho-probe console.
Oh, I get it; I'm dreaming! And this is all part of that delightful vacation your company sold me.
Oh, I get it; I'm dreaming! And this is all part of that delightful vacation your company sold me.
Not exactly. What you're experiencing is a free-form delusion based on our memory tapes. But you're inventing it yourself as you go along.

Well, if this is my delusion, who invited you?
Well, if this is my delusion, who invited you?
I've been artificially implanted as an emergency measure. I'm sorry to tell you this, Mr. Quaid, but you've suffered a schizoid embolism. We can't snap you out of your fantasy. I've been sent in to try to talk you down.

How much is Cohaagen paying you for this?
How much is Cohaagen paying you for this?
Think about it. Your dream started in the middle of the implant procedure. Everything after that--the chases, the trip to Mars, your suite here at the Hilton--these are all elements of your Rekall Holiday. And Ego Trip: You paid to be a secret agent.

Bullshit. It's all coincidence.
Bullshit. It's all coincidence.
What about the girl? Brunette, athletic, sleazy and demure; just like you specified. Is that a coincidence?

She's real. I dreamed about her before I even went to Rekall.
She's real. I dreamed about her before I even went to Rekall.
Mr. Quaid, can you hear yourself? "She's real because you dreamed her?"
Mr. Quaid, can you hear yourself? "She's real because you dreamed her?"
That's right.
You open it.
No need to be rude. I'll do it.
Suppose I do...then what?
Swallow this.
What is it?
It's a symbol. Of your desire to return to reality. --Inside your dream, you'll fall asleep.
Mr. Cohaagen wants to see you right away.
Any news of Quaid?
Any news of Quaid?
Not since you lost him.
Not since you lost him.
Watch your mouth, Captain.
Quaid! That's Quaid!
Where?
Where?
There! The woman!
HER!
Arrest that woman!
Richter! Call from Cohaagen.
This is Richter sir...I've got them pinned down.
Pull them out.
O.K., everybody pull out!
Hey, hey Tony. Give the big guy a break.
Relax, you'll live longer.
If we don't hand you over, everybody in the sector'll be dead by morning.
We don't have much choice then, do we?
Sit down.
Where's Kuato?
Where's Kuato?
On his way.
On his way.
You heard the rumors about the Pyramid Mine?

Yeah.

You tell me.
You tell me.
I don't know.

Yes, you do. That's why we brought you here. -- Cohaagen's big secret is buried in that black hole you call a brain. And Kuato's gonna dig it out.

You're Kuato, right?
You're Kuato, right?
Wrong. Kuato's a mutant. So don't get upset when you see him.
Shit!
C'mon!
They found us! Everybody out!
Melina!
Hey Harry...Harry! You ever heard of Rekall?
Rekall?
Rekall?
They sell fake memories.
They sell fake memories.
Oh, Rekall.
Oh, Rekall.
Yeah.
Yeah.
"RekallRekallRekall." You thinkin' of goin' there?
I don't know. Maybe.
Well don't.
Why not?
A friend of mine tried one of their "special offers"...Nearly got himself lobotomized.

No shit...

Don't fuck with your brain, pal. It ain't worth it.
Hey, Quaid!

How was your trip to Mars?
What trip?
You went to Rekall, remember?
You went to Rekall, remember?
I did?

Yeah, you did. I told you not to but you did anyway.

No, Harry, I'm already late...See you tomorrow.
Harry, what the hell is this?
Come on, let's go have that drink.
Come on, let's go have that drink.
What the fuck did I do wrong?! Tell me!
What the fuck did I do wrong?! Tell me!
You blabbed, Quaid! You blabbed about Mars!
You blabbed, Quaid! You blabbed about Mars!
Are you crazy?! I don't know anything about Mars.
You shoulda listened to me, Quaid. I was there to keep you outta trouble.
Harry, you're making a big mistake! You've got me mixed up with somebody else!
Harry, you're making a big mistake! You've got me mixed up with somebody else!
Unh-uh, pal. You've got yourself mixed up with somebody else.
Where?
Up to the right.
I want that fucker dead.
I don't blame you man. I wouldn't want Quaid porkin' my old lady.
I don't blame you man. I wouldn't want Quaid porkin' my old lady.
Are you saying she liked it?
Are you saying she liked it?
I'm sure she hated every fuckin' minute of it.
What was that? I couldn't hear you.
I've got Quaid.
Where is he?
Level 2. Galleria.
Level 2. Galleria.
He shoulda killed Quaid back on Mars.
Shit!
What is it?
That son of a bitch got to be around here somewhere.
I've got him. The guy in the turban.
I've got a weak signal over there.
Split up. Find him.
He's not at ground level.
Up!
I've got a lock! There!
Come on!
Look at this shit.
What the hell is this?
I'm sorry. Would you please rephrase the question.
How did I get in this taxi?!
How did I get in this taxi?!
The door opened. You got it.
Welcome to JohnnyCab. Where can I...?
Drive! DRIVE!!
Would you please repeat the destination?
Anywhere! Go!..Just go -- OH SHIT!! SHIT!!
The fare is eighteen credits, please.
Quit while you're ahead.

Thanks for taking Johnnycab.
Is that better?
Mmmm.....
Mmmm.....
Poor baby. This is getting to be an obsession.
Who?
The brunette. The one you told me about.
The brunette. The one you told me about.
Lori, I don't believe it...You're jealous of a dream!
Who is she?
Nobody.
Nobody.
Nobody?! What's her name?
Nobody?! What's her name?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Tell me!
It's not funny, Doug. You dream about her every night.
But I'm always home by morning.
Let me go!
Aw, come on, baby...You're the girl of my dreams.
...You mean it?
You know I do.
Lori...
Yeah, sweetheart?
Yeah, sweetheart?
Let's do it.
Let's do it.
Do what?
Do what?
Move to Mars.
Honey, do you have to spoil a perfectly wonderful morning.
Just think about it.
Just think about it.
Sweetheart, we've been through this a million times. You'd hate it on Mars. It's dry; it's ugly; it's boring! --I mean, really, a revolution could break out there any minute.

Cohaagen says it's just a few extremists.

And you believe him?
And you believe him?
All right, forget about it.
Doug, maybe we should take a trip.
Lori, move.
Lori, move.
There's lots nicer places than Mars.
Well...What do you say?
I'm late.
Sweetheart...I know it's hard being in a new town, but let's at least give it a chance here. Okay?
Lori, don't you understand? I feel I was meant for something more than this. I want to do something with my life.--I want to be somebody.
You are somebody. You're the man I love.
Bye.
What are you doing?
Some men just tried to kill me!
Muggers?! Doug, are you all right? What happened?
No! Spies or something. And Harry from work...Get down!
Harry from work...He was the boss.
Take it easy. Tell me exactly what happened? Why would "spies" want to kill you?
Take it easy. Tell me exactly what happened? Why would "spies" want to kill you?
I don't know! It had something to do with Mars.

You went to those brain butchers?!

Let me finish!

What did they do to you? Tell me!

--I got a trip to Mars.

Oh God, Doug.
Oh God, Doug.
Forget Rekall, will you! These men were going to kill me...
Forget Rekall, will you! These men were going to kill me...
Doug, nobody tried to kill you.
Doug, nobody tried to kill you.
They did! But I killed them!
You call this a paranoid delusion?!
Doug...
Not talk! I said TALK!!
I'm not your wife.
I'm not your wife.
The hell you're not.
The hell you're not.
I swear to God!...I never saw you before six weeks ago! Our marriage is just a memory implant -- agghh!

Our friends, my job, eight years together, I suppose all this was implanted too?

The job's real. -- But the Agency set it up.
The job's real. -- But the Agency set it up.
Bullshit.
O.K. then. If I'm not me, then who the hell am I?
Beats me. I just work here.
But Doug...There's something I want you to know. You're the best assignment I ever hand. Really.
I'm honored.
I'm honored.
You sure you don't wanna...? For old time's sake. If you don't trust me, you can tie me up.

I didn't know you were so kinky.
I didn't know you were so kinky.
It's time you found out.
Clever girl.
Doug...You wouldn't shoot me, would you? After all we've been through?
Doug...You wouldn't shoot me, would you? After all we've been through?
Yeah. Some of it was fun.
I suppose you're not here either.
I'm here at Rekall.
I love you.
Right. That's why you tried to kill me.
Right. That's why you tried to kill me.
Nooo! I would never do anything to hurt you. I want you to come back to me.
Nooo! I would never do anything to hurt you. I want you to come back to me.
Bullshit.
Then I can pull this trigger, and it won't matter.
Doug, don't!
Doug...Bob McClane.
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
Good to see ya. Right this way.
Now help me out here, Doug. You were interested in a memory of...
Mars.
Mars.
Right. Mars.
Right. Mars.
That a problem?
That a problem?
To be perfectly honest with you, Doug, if outer space is your thing, I think you'd be much happier with one of our Saturn cruises.Everybody raves about 'em.

I'm not interested in Saturn. I said Mars.
I'm not interested in Saturn. I said Mars.
Okay, you're the boss -- Mars it is.
Let's see...the basic Mars package will run you just eight hundred and ninety-nine credits. That's for two full weeks of memories, complete in every detail. --A longer trip'll run you a little more, cause you need a deeper implant.
What's in the two week package?
What's in the two week package?
First of all, Doug, when you go Rekall, you get nothing but first class memories: private cabin on the shuttle; deluxe suite at the Hilton; plus all the major sights: Mount Pyramid, the Grand Canals, and of course... Venusville.

How real does it seem?
How real does it seem?
As real as any memory in your head.

Come on, don't bullshit me.

I'm telling you, Doug, your brain won't know the difference. Guaranteed, or your money back.

What about the guy you lobotomized...Did he get a refund?
What about the guy you lobotomized...Did he get a refund?
You're talking ancient history, Doug. Nowadays, traveling with Rekall is safer than getting on a rocket. Look at the statistics.
All right.
Smart move. Now while you fill out the questionnaire, I'll familiarize you with some of our options.
Smart move. Now while you fill out the questionnaire, I'll familiarize you with some of our options.
No options.
No options.
Whatever you say...Just answer one question. What is it that is exactly the same about every vacation you've ever taken?
I give up.
You. You're the same. No matter where you go, there you are. Always the same old you. Let me suggest that you take a vacation from yourself. I know it sounds wild, but it's the latest thing in travel. We call it an "Ego Trip".

I'm not interested in that.
You're gonna love this. --We offer you a choice of alternate identities during your trip.
Secret agent...How much is that?
Aaah, let me tantalize you. You're a top operative, back under deep cover on your most important mission. People are trying to kill you left and right. You meet a beautiful, exotic woman...
Go on.
I don't wanna spoil it for you, Doug. Just rest assured, by the time the trip is over, you get the girl, you kill the bad guys, and you save the entire planet. Now you tell me. Is that worth three hundred measly credits?
They'll be here any minute! They'll kill you all!
What's he talking about?
What's he talking about?
Let me go!
I love you.
I love you.
Ooo, whatcha been feeding that thing?
Blondes.
Blondes.
I think it's still hungry.
I thought Cohaagen tortured you to death!
I guess he didn't.
I guess he didn't.
You couldn't get me a message? You never wondered what happened to me?
...What?
There's something I have to tell you...
I don't remember you.
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
I don't remember you. I don't remember us. I don't even remember me.
What, did you get amnesia?...How'd you get here?
Hauser left me a note.
Hauser left me a note.
Hauser? You're Hauser.
Hauser? You're Hauser.
Not any more.
Hauser, you're lost your mind.
I didn't lose it. Cohaagen stole it. He found out that Hauser switched sides,-so he turned him into somebody else. Me.

This is too weird.

Then he dumped me on Earth with a wife and a lousy job and ...
Then he dumped me on Earth with a wife and a lousy job and ...
Wait, did you say wife?...Are you fuckin' married!!?
She wasn't really my wife.
Oh, she isn't really your wife. How stupid of me...She was Hauser's wife.
Oh, she isn't really your wife. How stupid of me...She was Hauser's wife.
Forget I said wife.
Forget I said wife.
No. Let's forget everything! I've had it with you and your goddamn lies.
No. Let's forget everything! I've had it with you and your goddamn lies.
Why would I lie to you?
Why would I lie to you?
Because you're still working for Cohaagen.
Because you're still working for Cohaagen.
Don't be ridiculous.
Don't be ridiculous.
You never loved me, Hauser! You just used me to get inside.
You never loved me, Hauser! You just used me to get inside.
Inside what?
I think you better leave.
Melina, Hauser sent me to do something.

I'm not falling for it.
I'm not falling for it.
He said there's enough in here to nail Cohaagen for good.
He said there's enough in here to nail Cohaagen for good.
Get out!
I said get out!
Melina, please...People are trying to kill me.
I thought you didn't like me.
If Cohaagen wants you dead, you might be okay.
So you dropped by to apologize?
Kuato wants to see you. Come on!
Now what?
Jump!
By the way...ever heard of a company names Rekall?
I used to model for 'em, why?
I used to model for 'em, why?
Just wondering.
Not bad, for a hooker.
I'm not a hooker! That's my cover.
The first settlers are buried here. They worked themselves to death, but Cohaagen ended up with all the money. He built cheap domes and watched their kids turn into freaks.
I saw them.
What can I do?
Kuato's gonna make you remember a few things you knew when you were Hauser.
Kuato's gonna make you remember a few things you knew when you were Hauser.
Like what?
Like what?
All sorts of things. You might even remember you loved me.
All sorts of things. You might even remember you loved me.
I don't need Kuato for that.
I don't need Kuato for that.
Oh, since when?
He's lying.
You two-faced-bastard.
Are you all right? Are you still you?
I'm not sure dear? What do you think?
Where are you going?!
The reactor.
The reactor.
What reactor?!
What reactor?!
The one in the mine!
The one in the mine!
People are dying, Quaid!! Stop!! We've got to get air!!
Where's this "reactor" come from?
Aliens built it.
Aliens built it.
Aliens?!
You sure about this?
It's just up ahead.
Cohaagen knows it makes air. But the bastard won't turn it on.
Of course not. If Mars had an atmosphere, he's lose control.
The whole core of Mars is ice. The reactor melts it and releases oxygen.
Enough for everybody to breathe?
What's wrong?
I just has a terrible thought...What is this is all a dream?
I just has a terrible thought...What is this is all a dream?
Then kiss me quick...before you wake up.
This is the suitcase you gave me.
I gave you?
I gave you?
I'm leaving it here. Come get it and keep moving.
Wait!
What?
What?
...Who are you?
...Who are you?
We were buddies in the Agency back on Mars. You asked me to find you if you disappeared. So here I am, good-bye.
We were buddies in the Agency back on Mars. You asked me to find you if you disappeared. So here I am, good-bye.
What was I doing on Mars?! Damn!
Rhonda. Rhonda LeBeck. She's getting some kind of strange readings on her things.
Damn, you know, those kids turn up oil or uranium or something out there...next thing the Feds will be at our door. "Sorry, time to move. Eminent domain."
Or a big mother slug maybe?
Some kind of mutation...?
You guys all set?
Ready as we'll ever be.
Ready as we'll ever be.
Heather and I are going to drive around a little, see if we can find that college girl and tell her to get her ass back into town.
You stupid punk! You came <u>that</u> close, <u>that</u> close!!
One of these days, Melvin, somebody's gonna kick your ass.
Okay, Burt, listen. Forget shooting them. Tell me this: can you get to your truck?
No problem.
No problem.
Good. You've got the only truck in the valley that can make it up that damn jeep trail. So, here's the plan: You and Heather go for help. Get to the mountains...
Yeah, like they got a plan...
Breaker there, Earl. What do you want us to do?
Breaker there, Earl. What do you want us to do?
Hang on, Burt. The bastards are up to something.
Yeah, still got one poking around.
That's four. Let us know if it starts moving, Burt.
That's four. Let us know if it starts moving, Burt.
Roger that.
What? Well, for chrissake, we could have made a stand at our place! We had food, water...
You can't fight'em that way...
You can't fight'em that way...
You two jackasses hauled us way the hell out here...!?
How much you think?
I don't know... They're pretty quick...fifteen seconds?
What the hell is that, anyway?
Cannon fuse.
Cannon fuse.
What do <u>you</u> use it for?
What do <u>you</u> use it for?
My cannon.
Miguel, the trouble's come to us. If we're not ready...
Phone's out. Road's out. We're on our own.
I can't believe it. No tracks, no sign, no spoor.
Yeah, whatever they are, you'd think after they ate all those sheep they'd have to take a dump someplace... What the hell's going on in town?
You're not getting any penetration, even with the elephant gun.
Damn! Val, we can't get them. Never figured on having to shoot through dirt! Best goddamn bullet stop there is. Come back.
Knock it off, Burt!
I think I scared it!
What do you think? Max firepower or...?
I'd go for penetration. The 458 shooting solids -- less ammo to carry anyway.
A beauty, isn't it? We bought three of them for the rec room.
We sell 'em to you for three bucks a piece!
What the hell you doing back already?
You're never going to believe this, but the canyon road...we were on it not two hours ago...well, it's completely...
Negative copy on that, Pham, check your frequency. I'm on forty-nine.
Burt, can you hear me now?
Burt, can you hear me now?
Just barely, Pham. What are you all doing up on your roofs. What the hell's going on? Come back.
Burt! This is Val! Get out of your basement!! Take your radio! You and Heather get up on your roof! Then we'll talk, okay?!
Val? What the hell you doing back already?
Val? What the hell you doing back already?
Burt, get out! Get up on your roof or someplace! We found out what's been killing people! They're under the ground!
Burt, get out! Get up on your roof or someplace! We found out what's been killing people! They're under the ground!
What's under the ground? We're not getting up on the roof. Earth shelter's the best. Known that since I was a kid.
What's under the ground? We're not getting up on the roof. Earth shelter's the best. Known that since I was a kid.
Listen! Listen! We know what they are! They're big things under the ground! Much bigger than we thought! They're coming after you! They're coming right now!
Let's go you two. We're headed for the mountains.
In a minute.
That's fine. We've got some new things to teach them.
Damn it! They'll sink this rig just like a boat!
Jesus Christ, we're only going nine miles. Be there in two hours, tops!
Yeah, well those things are gonna be on our ass every foot of the way, right?
She's got my vote.
Right. We're gonna run. Get ready.
BACK OFF, BURT...!
Well, who put you two in charge?
Well, we'll ask around. Let you know if we hear of anything.
Thanks. God, I hope they're not screwed up. I might have to bag the whole semester. Anyway, sorry to bother you.
Thanks. God, I hope they're not screwed up. I might have to bag the whole semester. Anyway, sorry to bother you.
No problem. Nice meeting you. Hope you get it sorted out.
Jesus Christ...think it smells like that 'cause it's dead?
I don't see any eyes...must be totally subterranean...and those tentacles...
I don't see any eyes...must be totally subterranean...and those tentacles...
I think they shoot right outta its mouth, hook you, and pull you right in. Good thing we stopped it before it killed anybody else.
I think they shoot right outta its mouth, hook you, and pull you right in. Good thing we stopped it before it killed anybody else.
Yeah, I'm lucky it didn't find <u>me</u>. This is important, you know. This is like, well, let's say it, it's probably the biggest zoological discovery of the century. The century? Forget it. <u>History</u>.
Well, at least the bastard can't climb. Pardon my French.
Probably couldn't move too easily on the surface.
There's nothing like them in the fossil record, I'm sure...Okay, so they predate the fossil record... That'd make them a couple of billion years old...and we've just never seen one till now. Right.
I'd vote for outer space. No way those are local boys.
I might have an idea...
We're gonna have to come up with some kind of plan or it's just gonna wait us to death.
We're gonna have to come up with some kind of plan or it's just gonna wait us to death.
Well, I was wondering if we could...
I'll bet you're sorry the college ever sent you up here.
Well, I'm scared, but I'm not sorry.
Well, I'm scared, but I'm not sorry.
You know, Val went to that college, too. For a whole year. Couldn't quite sit still for it, though. Had too much vinegar in his system. But once he settles down, forgets this cowboy stuff, he'll be one in a million.
You know, up the jeep trail.
The mountains are solid granite. We'd be safe there, and we could hike along them...all the way to Bixby if we have to.
Well, we can take my truck then.
No good. You need major four- wheel-drive just to get up that jeep trail.
Oh my God.
Son of a bitchin' lowlife, putrid, scum...
He'll never make it! They're gonna get him!
VAL, STOP! THEY'RE COMING! DON'T MOVE!
We're not going over there, right?
No. We go straight.
So...now what?
Could we make it to the mountains?
Where the hell are they? Hope they didn't wise up.
Nope, there! That's one.
Hi, guys. Burt loaned me his camera.
Howdy, Rhonda.
Howdy, Rhonda.
You're really leaving, huh?
You're really leaving, huh?
You bet. You gonna be staying up here?
You bet. You gonna be staying up here?
Well, yeah! There's going to be major research up here. First thing is to get some pictures of that one we dug up.
You didn't cook breakfast?
Did it yesterday. Franks and beans.
Did it yesterday. Franks and beans.
No...it was eggs. I did eggs.
No...it was eggs. I did eggs.
Hell you did. Your turn.
How many cows does it take to make a stampede? Is it like three or more? Is there a minimum speed?
I was in one. A bolt of lightning blew up cottonwood tree. Three hundred head going hell-bent for the horizon. Wasn't so damn funny, I can tell you.
If there was one nearby I'd probably ask him.
I keep thinking, if we were but half serious about money, we should quit being hired hands and...
I keep thinking, if we were but half serious about money, we should quit being hired hands and...
Handymen, Earl. We're handymen.
Handymen, Earl. We're handymen.
Whatever the hell we are, we should quit and go get ourselves some real employment.
Goddamn jeep trail gets worse every year.
Has a lot of rain.
You're gonna get us hung up.
Do not talk to the driver.
Uh...Digging that waterhole for Nestor.
Burt and Heather's place is closer. Let's do their kitchen today. Do Nestor tomorrow.
Burt and Heather's place is closer. Let's do their kitchen today. Do Nestor tomorrow.
Nestor's out of town tomorrow. We don't dig today. We don't get paid today. Damn it, Valentine, you never plan ahead. You never take the long view. Hell, here it is Monday and I'm already working on Wednesday. It is Monday, right?
Who the hell's that? That's not what's his name...the grad student?
Nah, it's September. Must be the new one.
Nah, it's September. Must be the new one.
The new one! That's supposed to be a girl!
You know, if you wanted, we could take a look at those seismographs for her.
What the hell do we know about seismographs?
What the hell do we know about seismographs?
Nothing. But it sure might be a nice way of getting to know her.
Nothing. But it sure might be a nice way of getting to know her.
Why?
Why?
Goddamnit, Valentine, you won't go for any gal unless she fits that damn list of yours A to Z...
Goddamnit, Valentine, you won't go for any gal unless she fits that damn list of yours A to Z...
Well, sure.
Well, sure.
...And is dumber than my hind end. Like that Bobby Lynn Dexter...
Tammy Lynn Baxter.
Don't matter. They're all the same: dead weight. Can't make a decision, can't walk because of their shoes, can't work because of their fingernails. Make my skin crawl!
Don't matter. They're all the same: dead weight. Can't make a decision, can't walk because of their shoes, can't work because of their fingernails. Make my skin crawl!
Well, I'm a victim of circumstance.
Well, I'm a victim of circumstance.
I thought you called it your pecker. Look, don't make the mistake I made. Twenty years of looking for a woman exactly like Miss October 1968, and where'd it get me? Here with you.
Catch it later, Pham. Gotta get over to Nestor's.
Right. We plan ahead. That way we don't do anything right now. Earl explained it to me.
Why don't his parents ever take him to Vegas with them?
You gotta ask <u>that</u>?
So what if we just did it...today. Pack up. Drive straight down to Bixby. Get serious.
We could. We could. But we'd have to get <u>really</u> serious. It's gonna cost twice as much to rent a place.
We could. We could. But we'd have to get <u>really</u> serious. It's gonna cost twice as much to rent a place.
So? That car wash pays good, and they're always looking.
So? That car wash pays good, and they're always looking.
Car wash?! That's got no future. If we're gonna take the plunge we oughta have a better plan than that.
Car wash?! That's got no future. If we're gonna take the plunge we oughta have a better plan than that.
Yeah, sure. Go ahead and plan it...for a year or two.
Well, <u>you're</u> the one won't work in the car wash. You're the one's gotta have a plan.
Damn it, Val! Not having a plan is what keeps us doing jobs like this!
What keeps us doing jobs like this is you dragging your feet. I was up for going to Bixby. I was getting excited.
In the past year I must've said a hundred times "We gotta get out of Perfection. We gotta better ourselves." You gonna stand there in broad daylight and tell me you think I'm the reason we're still here? You want to know how close I am to going to Bixby right <u>now</u>?
In the past year I must've said a hundred times "We gotta get out of Perfection. We gotta better ourselves." You gonna stand there in broad daylight and tell me you think I'm the reason we're still here? You want to know how close I am to going to Bixby right <u>now</u>?
I'll call that little bluff. How close?
Uh oh, it's Nancy. She wants another load of firewood.
Forget it, man. It's not worth it.
She's got us. Now, listen, the plan is: we have done our last job in Perfection.
That's the plan.
We did it! We faced temptation and we did not bend!
Damn straight! Now there's nothing between us and Bixby but nothing!
So long, cactus!
Adios, bridge!
Jeez, look at that guy.
One job I'd never take is working around electricity.
One job I'd never take is working around electricity.
Especially when it's two hundred feet off the ground.
You're full of shit.
He's only got one damn jacket. That's him, I'm telling you.
Reckon he hated Perfection more than us? You suppose he <u>wanted</u> to kill himself?
If he did, why didn't he use his damn shotgun?
If he did, why didn't he use his damn shotgun?
Maybe he just couldn't pull the trigger...
Maybe he just couldn't pull the trigger...
Oh sure, he figured it was easier to die of thirst? Come on, sombody must've chased him up there.
Oh sure, he figured it was easier to die of thirst? Come on, sombody must've chased him up there.
Oh, you mean somebody who ain't scared of a twelve gauge shotgun. And then what did they do? Camp out down below and just wait for him to die?
Well, whatever the hell happened it's just one more goddamn good reason to haul ass out of this place.
You got that right.
Probably up a pole starving itself to death.
Okay, the plan is: pedal to the metal the whole way. We don't stop till we hit the carwash, not even to pee.
Okay, the plan is: pedal to the metal the whole way. We don't stop till we hit the carwash, not even to pee.
I'll go with that plan.
Oh, Jesus!!
What the hell is going on? I mean WHAT THE <u>HELL</u> IS GOING ON?!!
Brother, we decided to leave this place just one day too late, you know?
Well, there's sure as hell nothing to stop us now. Everybody we know between here and Bixby is already dead.
Those assholes are supposed to be <u>fixing</u> the goddamn road! Hey! Where are you guys? People gotta use this road, you know! You on a booze break or what?!
Val! Val!
Jesus! I don't <u>believe</u> this!
You're hung up again.
You're hung up again.
I am not!
Fuck you!
Hey, I don't want spend the night out here!
It must've grabbed us. That's why the truck stalled-out.
Yeah! Next time I tell you I'm not hung up...!
Slick as snot and I'm not lying.
Fifteen lousy bucks.
Fifteen lousy bucks.
A man who plans ahead.
Pham, we don't want to be stuck on a couple of canners. They better be fast.
Relax. A snake thing like that couldn't move too quick.
Relax. A snake thing like that couldn't move too quick.
Screw you. For all you know they could <u>fly</u>.
You want the rifle or the Smith?
The rifle.
That means we're gonna be out here, like, in the dark.
Great. Thank you.
Car's gone. We just missed them, that's all.
Then where's the goddamn Conway Twitty coming from?
Here's the plan...We don't <u>even</u> stop. Ride like hell. Tonight we keep right on going. We'll walk the horses.
That <u>is</u> the plan...I mean, goddamn it! What the hell are those things? How could they bury an entire Plymouth station wagon?
That <u>is</u> the plan...I mean, goddamn it! What the hell are those things? How could they bury an entire Plymouth station wagon?
<u>Why</u> would they do it?
Shut up! They got wind of something they don't like!
Oh shit!
What the hell are they?
Sons of bitches!
This is one big mother!
So this is the guy that had your seismos working overtime?
Hey, Rhonda, you ever heard of <u>any</u>thing like this before?
Sure, Earl, everybody knows about them. We just didn't tell <u>you</u>. Come on, nobody's ever seen one of these! We're really <u>in</u> on something here!
Pham Van don't get his mitts on <u>this</u> for no measly fifteen bucks!
You got <u>that</u> right!
Here's the plan: we'll get a...a flatbed, I guess, with a big winch, figure a five ton anyway.
Naw, don't want to winch it. That'd tear it all up. Want to lift it. Some kind of crane with lifting straps.
We'll take your word for it.
Yeah. Where's your truck?
Prairie dog burrow...
Little sons of bitches.
God, the live ones smell worse tan the dead ones.
Okay, now, how far's your truck?
I don't know. If this one's any faster than that other one...
I think we wait right here.
Well...haven't seen a sign for hours. Maybe it's long gone.
Maybe it is. Why don't you take a little stroll and see?
Maybe it is. Why don't you take a little stroll and see?
Fuck you, too. Pardon my French.
Son of a bitch!
Son of a god<u>damned</u> bitch! Been waiting there all this time. How the hell's it even know we're still here?
Son of a god<u>damned</u> bitch! Been waiting there all this time. How the hell's it even know we're still here?
It's been listening to us. It's got no eyes. It sure as hell can't smell anything underground, so I figure...
You know, I hate to be crude, but I'm gonna have to take care of some business here.
Me, too.
Well, folks, what's the plan?
First let's see if Stumpy's still out there.
Don't he have a home to go to?
Well, that's why Edgar never got down off that tower.
Run for it? Running's not a plan. Running is what you do when the plan fails. You're not even trying to come up with a plan!
Well, it's not like we've got a hell of a lot of options...
You go north, I'll go south.
Right.
You're right, don't matter where they come from.
Right. We need to be talking about what we're gonna do.
I'm gonna kick his ass!
I'm gonna help you.
Shut it up! Shut the little bastard up!
Chuck him out the door! Like a little hors d'oeuvre.
How the hell long it take <u>you</u> to change a tire?
Just about too damn long. Bolt pattern's probably wrong anyway.
Just about too damn long. Bolt pattern's probably wrong anyway.
We need another plan.
Wait a minute...the Cat. Could we take the Cat?
Jesus. It's slower than hell.
Jesus. It's slower than hell.
Yeah, but it weighs better than thirty tons. No way they could stop it.
But...we could pull something! We could, I don't know, drag a car behind it!
A car, huh? Like a big armored car? Need something bigger, tougher...our truck maybe...or, hell, that old semi trailer!
A car, huh? Like a big armored car? Need something bigger, tougher...our truck maybe...or, hell, that old semi trailer!
Its tires are flat...

Doesn't matter. The cat can pull <u>any</u>thing.
Doesn't matter. The cat can pull <u>any</u>thing.
Well...all <u>right</u>! We just roll on out of here!
Well...all <u>right</u>! We just roll on out of here!
We got a plan!
<u>I'm</u> making the run to the Cat.
Like hell you are.
Like hell you are.
Get real. I'm faster than you.
Get real. I'm faster than you.
<u>I'm</u> best at driving the Cat.
<u>I'm</u> best at driving the Cat.
Only if something happens to me.
Watch your ass, shithead.
Don't worry about me, jerkoff.
Damn it. What the hell are they doing? They're up to something.
I don't care what they're doing as long as they're doing it way over there.
Come on, everybody! We gotta run for those rocks over there!
Jesus, Val, it's pretty far.
Well...that's it. We're not getting off this rock...
Not going to pole vault anywhere. That's for sure.
Come on, you're not going to do your lasso thing...?
Hey, just 'cause you're no good with a rope...
They're...they're trying to make us move!
Or just knock us over. Look, use the bomb!
Or just knock us over. Look, use the bomb!
It's out last one. We can't kill them all.
Use the fucking bomb!
So, we get back on that rock and in three days we're dead anyway.
So, we get back on that rock and in three days we're dead anyway.
I want to live for the three days.
What the hell are you doing?!!
I GOT A GODDAMN PLAN!!
Light it, man! LIGHT IT!!
Not yet, not yet...
Road's in!
Road's in! Now, soon as we hit Bixby we start making phone calls. We could make some real money off this whole thing, get in <u>People</u> magazine...

No ties.
Christ, Val, maybe she's not your type, but you could, at least, be civil.
Civil? I'm civil.
Civil? I'm civil.
You're not civil, you're glum. We got the world by the tail with a downhill pull and all of a sudden you go glum on me.
Somebody paying you to do this?
She just practically asked you for a date. What the hell is wrong?!
Fine, make the mistakes I did. I think I'll just be playing this hand myself.
What?
What?
She likes <u>both</u> of us. We both helped her out.
She likes <u>both</u> of us. We both helped her out.
You are so full of shit...
You are so full of shit...
Oh yeah? Think about this: She ain't as narrow-minded as you. I'll lay odds she's looking for character in a man. For my part, I'd be proud to have her. I'd goddamn worship her.
How's she doing?
She wants to lay down. I'm a little worried.
Well, I brung her something I know she likes.
Damn, Fred, you can't give away all those.
Damn, Fred, you can't give away all those.
Forget it. I got vegetables coming out my ears. Usually the varmints eat up half my crop, but lately I ain't so much as <u>seen</u> a gopher or a jack-rabbit nowheres.

We playing cards tonight?
I think I'm gonna be sitting up with her.

I'd do the same. Well, catch you Thursday.

You bet.
Hi, guys, what you been up to?
Ran into the new college student, Rona.
Down, honey, down.
Yeah, Burt. The way you worry, you're gonna have a heart attack before you get to survive World War III.
Burt! Heather!
Yeah, Val.
Yeah, Val.
We're in deep shit over here. Let's change that plan.
We're here, Val. Just tell us what you need. Come back.
They're tearing down the houses here! We all gotta get outta here together! Now!
Val, we're going to have to forget about the truck...
Yeah, Heather, we got you.
I'm dead. Let's finish in the morning.
We have to go into Bixby in the morning. The concrete blocks are in.

The con...! Oh my God.

Just keep looking at that beautiful sky.

What?
What?
That's the sky that's going to be over our roof every night, when we're done.
That's the sky that's going to be over our roof every night, when we're done.
Ah, but consider this, if we don't finish the roof, we can looks at that sky all the time.
Well, what's wrong with it?
It's...gone...!
You sure this is where it was?
Am I sure?! It was right there. There's the cord.
Come on. Get away from it!
God, what a stink!
Hey Val, listen. Bearing going out, you think?
Could be.
And I appreciate it.
You don't get it, Pham. The idea was: we were ripping you off.
I don't believe this. The phone is out! Pham, your phone is out!
I didn't do it! What's going on?
Twenty.
Okay, ten dollars.
I've got a plan. You and Val take your truck, get to the mountains. Hike to Bixby. Get us some help.
Those scumsuckers are my radials, Pham!
Hi, I'm Rhonda. Rhonda LeBeck. I'm up here for the semester...
Yeah, geography.
Yeah, geography.
Right, geology. And you have to be Val and Earl. I've heard all about you.
Listen, got a question for you. Do you know if anybody is doing any blasting or drilling or anything like that?
Around here? Why would they?
Around here? Why would they?
Well, I'm supposed monitor these seismographs. You know, they measure vibrations...
Well, I'm supposed monitor these seismographs. You know, they measure vibrations...
Yeah, vibrations in the ground.
Yeah, vibrations in the ground.
Yeah, well, I'm getting what I refer to scientifically as "weird vibes." every sensor I've got is giving me strange readings. I mean, the school has had these machines up here three years and they've never recorded anything like this.
Darn it!
You okay?
You okay?
Yeah. But I'll tell you, if you ever wanted proof God is a man, this is it.
Think it's still following us?
Let's assume that it is.
Ready?
Yeah. One, two, three...
Rhonda's got an idea about that.
Yes, see, they move very easily through the Pleistocene Alluvials... ...the dirt...the loose soil that makes up the valley floor. But they can't move through solid rock. I think we should travel west to the mountains.
You paying attention? This oughta hurt like hell.
It does.
What's it doing?
Why do you all keep asking me?
Yeah, they're confused. They can feel our vibrations, but they can't find us.
They're working together, too.
What?!! Since when the hell's every goddamn thing up to us?!
You guys do all the odd jobs.
Look, the situation hasn't changed. We still have to get to solid rock. There must be <u>some</u> way!
Like <u>what</u>?! There's nothing left that'll make it to the mountains!
Listen, they only respond to vibration, right? Couldn't we... distract them somehow?
Yeah, good! Something to keep them busy. We need a decoy.
I think the ground's getting closer. I think we do it. We're gonna save our asses here!
Wait! How are you going to know they're all following it?
Wait! How are you going to know they're all following it?
Good point.
It worked! There they go!
LET'S DO IT!
I brought it... to the coroner.
An hour after you picked it up!
From Chinatown... Which is right up the street from the morgue! Where did you go with the body? What did you do with it?
Please... I need to sleep...
You're fishing. You don't know shit.
I know about Esparza.
...we had to lick his boots clean.
He was your snitch.
He was your snitch.
Our own Colombian Connection... For three years... Three years of ball breaking detective work. And we put a lotta bad guys behind bars.

I'm dead. We're both dead.
...Where're we goin'?
That-a-boy. Hospital.
That-a-boy. Hospital.
I don' need a hospital... I feel fine.
I don' need a hospital... I feel fine.
Too fine, Badalato. The bad news is, you're gonna live.
The photo on the left shows the bullet that killed Jimmy Chin, true?
True.
True.
And the one on the right is the bullet you test-fired from Shu's gun?
And the one on the right is the bullet you test-fired from Shu's gun?
Correct.
You would have the court believe that these two bullets were fired from the same gun?
Absolutely.
Or this -- is this a significant difference?
No it is not, Mr. Dowd.
Forensic ballistics isn't an exact science, is it?
It most certainly is.
It most certainly is.
Isn't there a ten to fifteen-percent margin of error?

Don't hurt him.
Where's the nearest hospital?
Where's the nearest hospital?
Bellevue. Straight up First --
Objection, your Honor! The fact that the witness is currently a patient is immaterial!
Sustained.
I will allow the witness to testify. With the understanding that your questions are confined to the area of Mr. Kim's modus operandi.
-- With objection!
-- With objection!
So noted.
Your Honor, that's not fair -- !
Complain to the Bar Commission.
Objection.
Sustained.
I move that the witness's testimony be stricken. He has clearly been terrorized by the prosecution, he's --
The testimony will remain in the record. Do you wish to cross-examine?
Good morning, Mr. Dowd. Do you think you might be up to cross-examining Mr. Ortega this morning?
Your Honor: I imagine that, no matter how careful my questioning, Mr. Ortega would, in his well-intentioned way, dig my client's hole even deeper.
Well then, does the defense have any witnesses?
I suppose I could find an inmate who'd say that Shu boasted about Chinatown just to survive in the joint -- though he didn't really do it...
-- Then you don't wish to call any witnesses, Mr. Dowd?
I would like to put Shu's alleged crime in a context, your Honor. And we do have the foremost expert on prison and street gangs right here in this room... If it please the court, I'd like to call Mr. Reynard.
You can't come back here... Anything happens to you I'm liable.
I'm a lawyer. The firm is thinking about renovating. Everything dates back to the Sixties.

Do you see a toilet here you think is really me?
Look, I'm a lawyer and --

"We"?
"We"?
I did five years in Attica. Lot of cons helped me in the joint. But I never got help from any lawyer... I built this business for guys like me who couldn't get a break anywhere else. "Art's Supplies" is for ex- cons. Not lawyers.
"Art's Supplies" is founded on trust, Mister --
Dowd. Eddie Dowd.
Dowd. Eddie Dowd.
If you'd had the sense to ask for my help, I might've helped you. But you've probably scared Chuckie Roeder off for good, I have a whole bunch of jumpy employees to handle and you're both going to be on your way. Now.
What, "everything"? You shot a corpse. I don't give a shit about that -- !
Let's snuff this lowlife!
Let's snuff this lowlife!
Hey -- the fact you popped Jimmy Chin in broad daylight proves it wasn't premeditated. Jury'll sympathize -- dude was banging your wife, right?

Clyde, you wait here. Glenn, got a minute?
I had a minute before the Mapp hearing -- but I couldn't get you on the phone, Eddie...
I had a minute before the Mapp hearing -- but I couldn't get you on the phone, Eddie...
Yeah, well I had reasonable cause to believe the judge might've heard of the Fourth Amendment.
No it's not the only issue. There's another issue, for the jury. What about entrapment?
What about entrapment?
We don't prosecute people because in the abstract they might be weak. Judge Brandeis said it best: Entrapment is a "dirty business!"
Can't I take a simple piss without --
Haven't heard that one before, Ed. But I guess I'll be hearing it again.
Not necessarily...
Come now. Did you see the gun?
I can describe it.
I can describe it.
Oh really?
Oh really?
It was silver, with a stubby barrel... snub-nosed, I think they call it... It wasn't automatic, it had one of those... cylinders...

Ah.
Not the whole time, of course. I --
No further questions.
Exactly what information led you to arrest my client just two-and-a-half hours after the shooting took place?
We had a description of the suspect.
We had a description of the suspect.
A "description"? What, Asian male 18 to 30, black hair, brown eyes?
We had information bearing on Mr. Kim's desire to gain admission into the Joe Boys by assassinating a member of a rival gang.
Didn't this "information" come from the Joe Boys themselves -- did they not all but hand you Shu Kai Kim, a Korean, an outsider?
You're implying that I planted a gun?
Not at all --
Not at all --
Kim's prints were all over it -- He admitted it was his gun, f'r godsake!
Kim's prints were all over it -- He admitted it was his gun, f'r godsake!
Your Honor, the witness' response was non-responsive... I ask you to strike it from the record...!
You see that? You wanna be like that?
No. No...
No. No...
You fucking swear to shut up!

Kim got busted at 19 for burglary. At 20 he was convicted in the shooting death of a young Chinese gang lord... The prosecution claimed Kim did it to get into "the Joe Boys"?
Chinatown street gang.

Kim denied it. But he admitted the gun was his, and he got life. Seems to have been an okay prisoner for eight years, til the... incident with Duane Lindeman.

-- The Nazi he knifed?
At the trial, you said you were at your apartment that night. Alone.
-- Remember?
...So what would we claim? He stabbed Duane Lindeman in self-defense?
With two knives taped to his hands? Forget it, Rog.
I feel like I've been mugged... Guy scared the shit out of me. You made your point, Eddie... I'm relieved we're not taking the case.
We're taking the other case.
We're taking the other case.
What other case?
What other case?
Eight years ago. The Chinatown hit.
Some gang punk gets wasted in front of the tourists. The mayor pressures the cops. The cops pressure the rival gang -- the Joe Boys. The Joes give up Shu Kai Kim -- the schmuck kid from Korea who's been pestering 'em to get in.
You really think that's what happened?
You really think that's what happened?
I don't know but it makes one hell of an opening statement.
-- Easy as that, huh?
Easy? No... We have to find some piece of evidence that got buried, to reopen the sucker.

What, the lunatic who --

"Cecil Stipe." Find it.
Do you have to do that?
"Have to"? No...
Shoulda told the one about Shu being the bastard child of Mother Theresa.
Saving it for the Sunday Times.
His name is Chuckie Roeder. But something's very weird.

Hey, Clyde Gruner sold these guys a pound of crystal meth at cost. We're Clyde's buddies, it's cool. Next exit.
Uh, Eddie? The, um, ballistics guy, George...? He called, and... His tests show that Shu's gun fired the bullet that killed Jimmy Chin.
George is a fucking burnout case. I didn't want him on the stand anyway. Get more names from Billy.

That's not gonna happen. I'm gonna create reasonable doubt. Buckle your seatbelt and watch me work.
But Roeder's dead. Ballistics says it's Shu! We don't have one witness -- unless we put Cecil Stipe on the stand...

-- What?
I've seen this picture before.
They could've been brothers. It's why the eyewitnesses picked Shu.
Christ... Shu is innocent.
"The killer wasn't Chinese"... Cecil Stipe was right. .!
Everyone else was wrong and the one fucking lunatic was right!
...Jesus!
Least we'd already be at the Morgue.
How long did it take Badalato to drive Jimmy Chin's body from Chinatown to the morgue?
... An hour. That's why I thought the morgue was on the other side of town.

Kitty, where exactly do you place the microphone to catch the most incriminating moans?
Just which Constitutional amendment protects our right to peddle PCP?
Forget it. You've blown your chance to participate in this case, Kitty.
Forget it. You've blown your chance to participate in this case, Kitty.
I'm kicking myself, Eddie... Right out of here.
Start looking into the Joe Boys -- who assigned the hits in 1980, what rank generally did the hits... Your extensive law enforcement contacts should be of some use.
I was never politically correct enough for Comrade Dowd.
I embellished.
"Dowd also reports that his team of private investigators..."?
"Dowd also reports that his team of private investigators..."?
I embroidered.
I embroidered.
"...are close to naming the man they believe actually killed Jimmy Chin"?
"...are close to naming the man they believe actually killed Jimmy Chin"?
I lied.
So there goes your theory about the Joes giving up Shu to protect their trigger man.
But I like that theory. And since I'm not putting Twerp Professor on the stand, and since I don't have a better theory, I'm sticking with that theory. Meantime I want pictures of the Joes. What'll you bet there was a guy in the gang looked enough like Shu to fool the eyewitnesses!
I've phoned every art supply retailer and wholesaler in the Tri-state area. No one's heard of Chuckie Roeder.
Have you considered that Chuckie Roeder's not calling himself Chuckie Roeder these days? Get his mugshot from one of the many law officers who've got hotpants for you... then canvass those art supplies places. We're gonna win this one, Kitty, but ya gotta believe...
A fucking wheelchair?
I didn't put him in a wheelchair. Reynard did. He can get around without one -- it's all in my report.
I didn't put him in a wheelchair. Reynard did. He can get around without one -- it's all in my report.
I don't have time to read every word in every report, I'm too busy getting killed in court... Meantime my crackerjack investigator can't find the goddam art supplies store where Chuckie-fucking-Roeder works!
-- Find him?
Eddie, these things take time. Particularly at this hour...
The Joe Boys in 1980...!
A number of them are dead, three are in prison, one's a waiter... Two -- you'll enjoy this -- two are actually members of the Chamber of Commerce.
I haven't thanked you for your work, Kitty. You're doing good work.
I'm a professional, Eddie. Getting paid is all the thanks I require.

I haven't paid you.

Right.
Got any booze in the house?
You don't drink "booze".

You do.
You do.
Eddie, if I wanted to make love with you again, I'd do it sober.
Eddie this is silly... are we supposed to pretend nothing's happened in the last ten years and --
Nothing has. But that's all changing.
Eddie... A guilty client's not the end of the world...
EXACTLY!
Eddie... go home. Get some sleep.
I don't need sleep!
I don't need sleep!
I need sleep. Some of us are mere mortals.

Screw you too, Kitty.

An Aryan Warrior with black teardrops painted on his face.

But why would a guy would do that? Paint black teardrops on his face?
I guess he... wanted you to think he was... somebody he wasn't.

I don't know shit, man! Goddammit --
Well I know that you're innocent, Shu -- even if you forgot.
No.
"No," what?
...I'm dying out there.
It's okay, Eddie.
Quite a bit you didn't tell me.
When I joined up I took an oath of secrecy. I told you what you needed to know.
I didn't need to know that a man I'm defending on a gang-murder rap is a prison soldier who kills over drugs?
It was self-defense.
It was self-defense.
Jimmy Chin? Was that self-defense too?
-- How could I help you?
By trusting me. Shit, man...
When you leave this place you're going out to dinner or a movie or get laid. Where's our bond? I'm going back to my cell and wait to die. So tell me: Where's our bond?
For awhile we had this dream we were innocent. That was our bond... but then we woke up. And now I'd like to hear everything.
'lo, Cecil.
See-cil.
See-cil.
See-cil. I'm Eddie Dowd, this is Roger Baron. We're lawyers.
Oh come on, Cecil.
Hey, Chinese people have this energy field that vibrates at a particular frequency.
I did two tours in 'Nam...
Good. Now we're going to take an affadavit from you, but only concerning the facts of the Chinatown shooting. We honestly don't give a shit about the Kennedy assassination.
Are you willing to testify that the man you saw shoot Jimmy Chin was not the man the cops arrested?
They g-got the wrong g-guy.
They g-got the wrong g-guy.
When the D.A. hears I filed the writ, he'll send someone here, maybe claiming to be a journalist. That person will ask you lots of questions. Just be truthful, Cecil, okay? To all of us?

...You told the Desk Sergeant you were certain Mr. Kim wasn't the killer? You left your telephone number?
Y-yes, sir.
Y-yes, sir.
Did the police make any attempt to phone you, to follow up?

No, s-sir.

Thank you, Mr. Stipe.
I'd l-like to answer the question.
Mr. Rabin has no right to --
Edward T. Dowd.
Don Reynard.
Of course you know Dean Rabin, one of my Assistant D.A.s. Dean generally handles nuisance cases like the... what's the man's name?
Shu Kai Kim.
Shu Kai Kim.
You won't remember this, but in '72 I was one of several prosecutors assigned to the Black Panther-Police Shootout. We had a whole team, and you walked into court by yourself and kicked our collective butt. So what've you been up to since then?

Let's not drag the Constitution into this.
I'm sorry if I've ruined your day, Mr. Reynard. But my client's had a rough eight years behind bars and --
Your client is guilty. Don't dick around with me.
Back in the Seventies I spent years putting away gangsters in a Colombian syndicate called "the Ochoa". These guys are very dangerous, Ed. When I hear that a small-time dope lawyer is conniving to spring one of these guys, I see red.
I'd have that checked, Mr. Reynard.
Now maybe you got this case reopened because you see yourself as a thorn in society's side, or you want to walk into any restaurant in Chinatown and get free dumplings...
Are you implying that my motives are less than sincere?
Are you implying that my motives are less than sincere?
Yes, but that's not the issue. What's on your wish list, Ed? Pleading Kim out to first degree man on both homicides, with an agreed sentence of 15 to life running concurrent? Come on... What're you looking for here?

Please don't bullshit me, Mr. Reynard. You've got witness problems, you've got proof problems...
You're my only problem, Ed. What does it take to make you go away?
I see: He'd walk out next month.
That's right.
That's right.
We reconvict, your man's looking at 25 years on two counts, served consecutively. So what I'd like to ask, Ed, is: Are you joking?

You know you're very tense, Mr. Reynard. Y'oughta take a week off, fly the wife and kids to Oahu.
But now you've strayed from your area of expertise -- dope -- into street assassins. A subject on which you're dangerously ignorant.
But I'm a quick study. Tell your Deputy D.A. -- Rabin? -- that I'll see him in court.
But I'm a quick study. Tell your Deputy D.A. -- Rabin? -- that I'll see him in court.
No, Mr. Dowd, you'll see me in court. I'm prosecuting this case.
I'll prosecute anyone who fucks up. If that makes me look racist, it's a trade-off I'll live with, Ed.
That's big of you, Bob.
Isn't it a fact that the "six other Asian men" in the line-up were all of the classic Mongoloid type, whereas Shu has the distinct facial bone structure of a Korean?
Objection. The witness is not an expert in racial classification.

Isn't it a standard trick to pack a line-up with men who resemble each other but look different than the suspect, so the suspect will stand out for the eyewitnesses?

Calls for speculation.
You don't speak any Chinese dialects? Then you get your intelligence from snitches?
Badgering.
To the best of your recollection, were you sober when you performed the tests?

If I were sitting where I normally sit, I would say "Calls for speculation."
Did you do any hands-on work or did you just supervise, from on high?
Mr. Dowd, I was personally involved with all phases -- and principals -- of the investigation.
Mr. Dowd, I was personally involved with all phases -- and principals -- of the investigation.
And who were the detectives who assisted you, Mr. Reynard?
Lou Sklaroff, Vin Badalato, Dave Montell.
The same three detectives on the Jimmy Chin case.
In those days, they often worked as a team.
And who was Arturo Esparza?
I don't think I know that name.

Isn't it true that without Esparza, you had no investigation?
I think you're a dangerous man, Mr. Dowd.
I think you're a dangerous man, Mr. Dowd.
I hope so, Mr. Reynard.
No.
No? Then what did he say?
You read Eddie's Chase Manhattan Bombing summation in the Leftist Law anthology?

My skip-trace turned up two Cecil Stipes. One's in Butte, Montana. Other's at Riverhead Veterans Psychiatric.
I'll take odds on Cecil Number Two.

So what'd this guy do? Snitch off a dealer?
You getting this?

But they've still got Laura Gordon -- and she was the closest, about 20 feet from the killer.
It's okay. It was always like that.
Shouldn't one of us...?

No -- leave him be. It's better for everyone.
What do you want?

Yes. Either right now or right when I thought of it. The name and memory of Teresa Banks is haunting me. Lately I have been filled with a knowingness that the murderer will strike again.

You weren't kiddin'. This stuff's got the sting of the forty-eight hour blend.
That's right. That's the best coffee you're gonna get around here.
Is there a golf course around here?
Not a lot around here, no. Got some clubs, but not very many fellas with balls.
Thanks for your help, Carl. Sorry we woke you up.
That's alright. I was having a bad dream. I was dreamin' about a joke with no punchline.
Okay, that's it. I've had enough of the waiting room now.
Oh.
What are you doing here in the trailer court, Deputy?
Maybe I just live here, what do you think about that?
Maybe I just live here, what do you think about that?
Can I ask you where you were the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
Can I ask you where you were the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
You can tell J. Edgar that I was at a party and I got fifteen fuckin' witnesses.
Did you know Teresa Banks?
Got a couple of cups of coffee at Hap's from her. That's it. By the way where do you get off questioning a lawman? I could ask you the same question.

Right, Gordon. We'll be in touch.
What is it, Gordon?
COOP, AGENT CHET DESMOND HAS DISAPPEARED. GONE LIKE THE WIND IN DEER MEADOW.
Phillip?
COOPER, MEET THE LONG LOST PHILLIP JEFFRIES. YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF HIM AT THE ACADEMY.
HE'S GONE.
What?

ALBERT, COME BACK HERE. HE'S GONE CALL THE FRONT DESK.
QUICKLY MEN... WORD ASSOCIATION, COOP. WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW?
Teresa Banks.
Teresa Banks.
ALBERT?
It was a year ago today that Teresa Banks was killed. I'm wondering if the murderer will ever kill again.
ALBERT, WHY TYLENOL?
Agent Chet said he wanted to check the trailer court one more time. He had me drive the van with the body back here. Which we did. It was 105 miles.
Anything else?
Anything else?
Did Gordon show you a woman named Lil?

I'm up to speed, Stanley.

Agent Chet wouldn't tell me what the Blue Rose meant.

And neither will I.

Oh, alright. You know, I liked Agent Desmond. He had his own M.O.
I cracked the Whiteman case with this.

Tell me about the letter.
Tell me about the letter.
Take a look at this. Chet and I found it under Teresa Banks' ring fingernail.
And no one found the ring?
No, sir, we did not.
Where is the ring?
Someone else has it now.

That would indicate that it's the future.

I'd like to ask you a few questions about Teresa Banks
I'd like to ask you a few questions about Teresa Banks
Sheriff Cable's already asked me a few questions about Teresa Banks. She worked nights for a month. That's it.

No.

Ever see her with someone else?

No.
No.
Did she ever mention any friends?

No. Ask Irene over there.
Take a good look around. There's nobody in this place -- you're meetin' the reason why. What'll it be?
How come Jack let's you work here?
How come Jack let's you work here?
Jack and I are united in holy matrimony.
Jack and I are united in holy matrimony.
Say no more.
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special Agent Chet Desmond. I'd like to ask you a few questions about Teresa Banks. Jack said you knew her. How well?
She only worked here a month. Nice girl. Never seemed to get here on time though. Ask me she had a little problem with --
Came looking for a job with a friend of hers. Pretty girl. Could've been her sister.
What happened to her?
What happened to her?
There was only one job. Teresa took the job. Her friend took a hike. Never saw her again.

Did you ever see Teresa take cocaine?
Did you ever see Teresa take cocaine?
No.
No.
Do you take cocaine, Irene?
Do you take cocaine, Irene?
No, I do not. I never took cocaine or any other drugs. I don't take drugs.
He's with me. Anything you would like to tell us about Teresa Banks that would help us out?
I've thought about that. I think her death is what you would call a "freak accident".
I've thought about that. I think her death is what you would call a "freak accident".
Thanks.
You know, I never told anybody, but once for about three days, just before her time, Teresa's arm went completely dead.
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
Her left arm. It was numb. She said she couldn't use it. Said it had no feeling. Probably from the drugs she was taking. I just thought I ought to tell you.
Her left arm. It was numb. She said she couldn't use it. Said it had no feeling. Probably from the drugs she was taking. I just thought I ought to tell you.

That was really something. That dancing girl. What did it mean?
Code. If you work with Gordon you learn that right away.

Code, I've heard a lot about this.
Sort of shorthand.
Shorthand. Really?

We're heading into a difficult situation.

How do you figure?
How do you figure?
I'll explain it to you. Do you remember Lil's dance?
Lil was wearing a sour face.
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
Her face had a sour look... that means we're going to have trouble with the local authorities. They are not going to be receptive to the FBI.
Oh, the uncle is missing.
Not Cole's Uncle but probably the sheriff's uncle in federal prison.
Not Cole's Uncle but probably the sheriff's uncle in federal prison.
So the sheriff had got an Uncle who's committed a serious crime.
So the sheriff had got an Uncle who's committed a serious crime.
Right, which is probably why Lil was wearing a red wig meaning we are headed into a dangerous situation. Let me ask you something, Stanley, did you notice anything about the dress?
Right, which is probably why Lil was wearing a red wig meaning we are headed into a dangerous situation. Let me ask you something, Stanley, did you notice anything about the dress?
The dress she was wearing had been altered to fit her. I noticed a different colored thread where the dress had been taken in. It wasn't her dress or she must have lost some weight.

Gordon said you were good. The tailored dress is our code for drugs. Did you notice what was pinned to it?
Gordon said you were good. The tailored dress is our code for drugs. Did you notice what was pinned to it?
A blue rose.
A blue rose.
Very good, but I can't tell you about that.
What did Gordon's tie mean?
What? That's just Gordon's bad taste.

I don't know, Sam.

Maybe, later we could take a look.
Maybe, later we could take a look.
Sure, but let's finish up with this first.
Crushed skull. Probable cause repeated blows to the back of the head with an obtuse angled blunt object. Subject looks to be between 16 and 18 years of age.
Cole said she was 17.
There appears to be a contusion under the ring finger of her left hand.
Oh.
Accidental?
Agent Desmond, would you hold the finger for me. There's something up there.
What is it?
It is a piece of paper with the letter "T" imprinted on it. Take a look.
Geez, Agent Desmond, it's three-thirty in the morning. Where are we going to sleep?
We're not. You and I are going to get some food.
We're not. You and I are going to get some food.
Yes, it's been several hours since we've eaten. I didn't realize that so much time had past, did you, Agent Desmond?
Agent Desmond, it's...
It's late, Sam.
It's late, Sam.
It's not late, it's early. Really early.
I doubt it was drugs, more likely a problem with a nerve. I could recheck the arm for injuries, but for real nerve work we are going to have to take the body back to Portland.
I think that's a good idea.
I think we should see the sun rise at the Canyon Trailer Park.
Are you speaking to me in a code?
Are you speaking to me in a code?
No, Sam, I'm speaking plainly and I mean just exactly what I say.
No, Sam, I'm speaking plainly and I mean just exactly what I say.
In that case, we should go to the Canyon Trailer Park.
She lived alone.
She must have known someone.
You better dust this place, Sam.
I'll get my kit.
Take a look at this.
She's wearing a ring.
My guess is there isn't enough detail in the photo to get an idea of the design on the ring, but we should do a blowup of this anyway.
May I see the magnifying glass, Agent Desmond? There doesn't seem to be enough detail in the photo to ascertain the design on the ring.
I couldn't help but notice that you had a suspicion that Deputy Cliff was the murderer. You did think that, didn't you, Agent Desmond?
He's not the murderer. But he's a bozo.
He's not the murderer. But he's a bozo.
Yes, he is like a clown.
When he says, "Discussion", how do you take that, Agent Desmond?
I don't take it, Sam. I give it.
One thing that has been troubling me. That lamp at the diner. Do you think they were working on it for esthetic reasons or was their work due to faulty wiring?
Faulty wiring.
Faulty wiring.
Esthetics are subjective, aren't they, Agent Desmond? I'm Sam Stanley. If you ever need me.
Esthetics are subjective, aren't they, Agent Desmond? I'm Sam Stanley. If you ever need me.
Thanks, Sam, for the good work. You have a good eye for detail.
Thanks, Sam, for the good work. You have a good eye for detail.
We do notice things, don't we, Agent Desmond? Are you going back to the trailer park for the Blue rose?
If I am going to get through math today, you're going to have to bring me up to speed quick.
You didn't do your homework?

Sweet? God, he's gorgeous.
Sweet? God, he's gorgeous.
James is very sweet and very gorgeous.
Do you think that if you were falling in space you would slow down after a while or go faster and faster?
Faster and faster. For a long time you wouldn't feel anything. Then you would burst into fire... forever.
Maybe I better start our homework.
Okay, I suppose I should go home.

You know, even when I think about your face I get happier.
Do you want to talk?
No, I want to smoke.
I'm in a mess today, too. I'm thinking about doing it with Mike. What do you think?
Donna, you are such a crack up. You don't even like Mike. Is this what you are going to do to show me you are not uptight.
Donna, you are such a crack up. You don't even like Mike. Is this what you are going to do to show me you are not uptight.

History is on our side, Ben. It's no accident that the great explorers were named Hennepin, Nicollet, Marquette.
They were looking for wood.

Why wouldn't you eat a fish eye, Harry?
I saw a guy eat a fish eye once in Seattle. He was digging through his food with his chopsticks for about five minutes till he found the fish eye and he dropped it into his throat. I guess it must have gotten stuck in his uvula because right away he started to have trouble. His throat began to flutter there like there was
I'm not saying it's right or wrong, it's just the way I feel. It's the custom thing I was thinking of. In America we don't use any part of the fish but the meat just to the side of the insides. We throw away the tail, the rest of the insides and the head.
I understand.

We throw away the whole head.

The Norwegians are coming next week and I want you to learn to say what I just learned in Norwegian. So you can talk to them. I want you to learn to say, "Hello, my name is Leland Palmer".

Neither is mine. And can't we talk about something serious for a change.
This is serious. Mr. Benjamin Horne's got a delegation of Norwegians coming in next week and I want both of you to learn to introduce yourself. Sarah, you first.
Leland, what are you doing?
Look at this finger here.

What's wrong?
Nothing, I chickened out.
Someone who knows how to clean knows where the object was before she started cleaning and then that object goes back to its exact same spot. Shelly, I know where everything in this house is. Sometimes on the road I mentally go through this whole house and picture where every item is.
Lay off the bennies, Leo.
Lay off the bennies, Leo.
Anybody can clean the surface of an object, but dirt can find its way anywhere. To really clean, you have to scrub below the surface. WHERE THE DIRT IS, SHELLY.
That's one thing you are going to learn, Shelly, -- HOW TO CLEAN. It takes scrubbing, Shelly. There is no easy way. THIS IS WHERE WE LIVE, SHELLY.

As far as we know, nothing.
He was accused of jury tampering.
Accused. Not indicted. He resigned the firm. Divorced nineteen seventy. Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in 'seventy- eight. Since then he's been on his own. Four cases before the Circuit Court. He lost them all. He drinks.

All right. But let's keep the price down. I've called Ed Concannon. He recommends that we continue to respond as if we're going to trial.
If we were to go to trial, would we win the case?

How did you settle on the amount?

After, after the operation, when that poor girl, she went in a coma. Dr. Towler called me in.

And you would come here, and on a slip of memory four years ago, you'd ruin their lives.
Your Honor, Bishop Brophy and the Archdiocese have offered plaintiff two hundred and ten thousand dollars.
Huh!
Huh!
My doctors didn't want a settlement at any price. They wanted this cleared up in court. They want their vindication. I agree with them. But for today the offer stands. Before we begin the publicity of a trial. For today only. When I walk out that door the offer is withdrawn. As long as you understand that. It's got to be that way.
Mr. Concannon...?
Nothing further, your Honor.
Nothing further, your Honor.
Mr. Galvin, rebuttal?
Objection! This is ri... expect us to accept a photocopy, we have the original right...
I'll rule on that presently. Proceed.
No further questions.
You may step down.
Thank you, your Honor. We object to the copy of the admissions form as incompetent and essentially hearsay evidence and cite McGee versus State of Indiana, U.S. 131 point 2 and 216 through 25 of the Uniform Code: 'The admission of a duplicate document in preference to an existing original must presuppose the possibility of alteration and so must be disallowed.' And, your Honor,
...one moment, Mr. Concannon...
The document is disallowed, the jury will be advised not to consider the testimony of Kathy Costello regarding the Xerox form. It's unsubstantiated and we can't accept a copy in preference to the original...
Thank you, your Honor. Further: Ms. Costello is a rebuttal witness. As a 'Surprise Witness' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony. As her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form, which has been disallowed I request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here.

You guys, you guys, you're all the same. The Doctors at the hospital, you... it's 'What I'm going to do for you'; but you screw up it's 'We did the best that we could. I'm dreadfully sorry...' And people like me live with your mistakes the rest of our lives.
If I could accept the offer right now, I would. They took it back.

Dr. Thompson. From your review of the hospital records of May twelfth nineteen seventy-six.
In your opinion, what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye?
In your opinion, what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye?
Cardiac arrest. During delivery her heart stopped. When the heart stops the brain's deprived of oxygen. You get brain damage. That is why she's in the state she's in today.

Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes. In your opinion is his estimate correct?
Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes. In your opinion is his estimate correct?
It's my opinion it took him much longer. Nine... ten minutes. There's too much brain damage.
I didn't do too well for you.
No, you did fine.
No, you did fine.
I'm afraid that's not true. Will you want me to stay on till Monday?

No. No. Thank you. You go home.
Are you saying that a failure to restore the heartbeat within nine minutes in itself constitutes bad medical practice?
Well...
I... in that small context I would have... I would have to say 'no.'
Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?

Dr. Towler; page 406, 'Contraindications to general anesthetic. Ideally a patient should refrain from taking nourishment up to nine hours prior to induction of general anesthetic.' Does that sound familiar?

Okay. Now, so he's in jail. He, finally, he gets to see the light, he calls up Harrington, he says he thinks he made a mistake. As if by magic, charges against him are dropped, he's released from jail. P.S. He's fired from the firm, his wife divorces him, he turns to drink and mopes around three and a half years.

Mister Secretary - if they link up with those others near Fresno...
All right - I've seen enough!
There's only one thing that will stop the Martians! We've held back pre- viously because of the danger of radiation to civilians. Now there's no choice. The United Nations has voted authority to the United States. The White House will confirm an order to use the Atom bomb.
Then our first target will be the initial landing place outside Los Angeles.

Hurry up! Jump in!
There was a girl with them...If I could find her....
You look kinda lost yourself.
But I think I know where she'll be....

You never know where you're going to wind up when you go to a square dance!
Good to see you, General. This is Pastor Collins, director of Civil Defense. Sheriff Bogany, head of the local forces ... Miss Van Buren.
Would you like some coffee, General?
We can't go into town - everybody's getting out of there! I'll fly you over to Pasadena.
Can you handle one of these?

I never noticed before - that's a cowboy tie....
I bought it for the square dance. I thought I ought to wear some- thing Western.
Is that... machine...?
It's gone now.
It's gone now.
Where are we?
Where are we?
Southwest of Corona, somewhere. There must have been another cylinder down here. They've been through this whole area and cleared everybody out. There's a farmhouse. Let's see if we can find something to eat...!
I almost forget when I ate last. It looks so good.... You know, mostly I get my meals in coffee shops and restaurants.
Don't you live at home?
Don't you live at home?
No, on the campus. I haven't any family.

If they're mortal, they must have mortal weaknesses. They'll be stopped -- somehow!
I've been as close to them as anyone. But not close enough for real observation...
I feel like I did one time when I was small. Awful scared and lonesome...I'd wandered off - I've forgotten why - but the family and whole crowds of neighbors were hunting for me. They found me in a church. I was afraid to go in any place else.
I stayed right by the door - praying for the one who loved me best to come and find me. It was Uncle Matthew who found me.
I liked him.
He liked you ... I could bawl my head off!
But you're not going to. You're not the kind. You're tired, anyway. You've been up all night. You cracked up in a plane. Slept in a ditch. But you want to know something? It doesn't show on you at all.
How long was I out?
Hours. I've been so scared...!
Nothing there now.
It was... ...one of them!

We're right in a nest of 'em! ... I've got to get a look at them.
Maybe they aren't too sure we're here.
They could be as curious about us as we are about them.
They could be as curious about us as we are about them.
Maybe ... Maybe they want to take us alive.
They've blocked it!
It's blocked here, too! They've pushed up earth or something all around outside. Here, this way...!
Is it possible to go in right after the explosion?
Yes, with these suits. We've used them before on atomic tests... Odd- looking, aren't they?

How'd you guess?
How'd you guess?
That's the kind of a kid brother you'd have!
The Rockies...! You'd rather get back to that big family of yours in Minnesota, wouldn't you?
I wonder if they're going through this too...?
I probably wouldn't be able to get to them if I tried...
You'll be all right with us.... ...for as long as anybody's got!
You'll be all right with us.... ...for as long as anybody's got!
Don't let's lose each other.
That's what knocked the phones out, too.
How could it happen to everybody's watch together?

Have you got a pocket compass?
That needle ain't pointing north!
It's pointing out to the gully - where that meteor came down.
What is that gizmo?!
I think that - gizmo - is a machine from another planet.

We better get word to the authorities and -- Look!
This Martian blood... Let's make a quick analysis and see what we've got!
It might give us something.
A forlorn hope - but there is a chance.
It might give us time to search out some weakness in the Martians.
It might give us time to search out some weakness in the Martians.
I believe we can get a lead from their anaemic blood.
We know now that we can't beat their machines -- but we can beat them! They are mortal beings...The only question is whether we have time enough to do anything!
If we get what transportation we can, and pick up instruments and books from Pacific-Tech...
Gratzman! -- Gratzman! Did you get those biotics?
No. I thought you had them.
No. I thought you had them.
All right. I'll get them! Go ahead - go ahead! I'll catch up with you.
I got a message for you. You're the guys from Pacific-Tech, ain't you?
Right.
Right.
Looks like the fishing was good.
It's about that meteor. They say it's a whopper. The District Officer phoned us at the lookout up on the summit. Thought you might be interested... It's ten or twelve miles from here - over by Linda Rosa.
Are they sure it's a meteor? It didn't come down like one.
Are they sure it's a meteor? It didn't come down like one.
That's right - came down in kinda spurts, didn't it? You fellers'll have to figure it out. You're scientists All I know - they say it's as big as a house and practically red hot.

I'd like to borrow your car and take a look at it in the morning.
There's one - there's the other, and we're right between them!
So is the town, I notice!

I warned you Civil Defense people to be ready if you have to evacuate.
I warned you Civil Defense people to be ready if you have to evacuate.
I just came to tell you - everyone has been alerted.
Colonel - shooting's no good!
It's always been a good persuader.
It's always been a good persuader.
Couldn't you try to communicate with them first - and shoot later if you have to?
General Mann -- I was told to expect you, sir. I'm Colonel Heffner.
I'm here to make up a report, not to interfere with the operations you've set up. You're still in command. Clayton Forrester! I haven't seen you since Oak Ridge.
That's their position? You've certainly got them surrounded. I suppose they've neutralized all communications here.
Not all. Radio is out. But our field phones are okay so far.
Not all. Radio is out. But our field phones are okay so far.
And they'll go out the minute there's another ray. A cylinder reported down by Huntington Beach. That's a job for the Navy.
We will, sir!
From the data - and from that picture the Air Force took earlier tonight ... ... what we've got in the gully out there is a guide ship. One lands ... Others follow later. They appear to clear an area, then drop in groups of threes, joined magnetically. Is that possible?
My orders are not to go into action unless they make a move out of there.
That's because we want a chance to observe them. This is the only place we've had time to surround them with sufficient force to contain them. What happens here will be a guide to all other operations. The minute action begins and a pattern of defense develops, I'll get my report to Washington. You've deployed your forces well.

They'll probably move at dawn.
That probably dropped half way to Pomona!...What do you think?
It was nearer than that.
Uncle Matthew...this is Dr. Clayton Forrester. My uncle - Dr. Matthew Collins, pastor of the Community Church.
Well-l...how do you do, Dr. Forrester!
They don't do much of anything...!
There's a square dance at the social hall this evening.
They are living creatures out there.
But they're not human! Dr. Forrester says they're some kind of an advanced civilization --
But they're not human! Dr. Forrester says they're some kind of an advanced civilization --
If they're more advanced than us, they should be nearer the Creator for that reason!
Let's go back inside, Uncle Matthew.
I've done about all I can do here. You go back in. Sylvia - I like that Doctor Forrester. He's a good man.
Number three to. D.O....Number three to D.O.
D.O. to number three..come in.

Well, there's some fellows fishing at Pine Summit might be interested. They probably saw it come down. I'll let 'em know...What's it look like?
Better'n a lion farm or a snake pit. We won't have to feed it!
We sell the tamales, enchiladas - hot dogs!
Must be somebody in there.
Who? Where d'you think they come from!
Who? Where d'you think they come from!
How would I know...!
Maybe these are not men - not like us.
Everything human don't have to look like you and me....
What'll we say to 'em?
Welcome to California!
They'll understand us, all right!
Sure, sure! Everybody understands you wave the white flag, you wanna be friends.
I thought you'd killed Freddy off.
We did. Bad mistake. The fans are clamoring for more. So, Evil never dies, right? Anyway, a while back we got a call from Wes. He's got this idea. And who better to resurrect Freddy than his creator?

I thought he'd stopped doing horror.
I thought he'd stopped doing horror.
Believe it or not, he told me I hadn't heard from him in ten years because he hasn't had any good nightmare. They're his inspiration. But now he's got a new script in the works.
Which means he's having nightmares again?
He's very excited about it.
He's very excited about it.
The nightmares.

He's excited about the script. You should be too. It stars you.

Can I read it?

He's not showing it until it's down. But it sounds hot, and we wanted to get all our stars lined up in case it is. You and Robert got great ratings today. Which is the first thing we needed to know.

Sort of a trial balloon.
I don't know, Bob. I'm flattered and all, but I've got a kid, now.
So?

So I don't know about horror.

Come on. Kids love horror.

And I...I've got other things happening.

I'm sure we can match any offer.
Sweetie, you've got lots of fans, we've done market studies. You rate right up there. We've already got Chase working on a prototype for the glove.
What?
What?
I know. We asked him to keep it kind of surprise until we talked. Look, how about we get in touch your agent. You still with Jerry?
I know. We asked him to keep it kind of surprise until we talked. Look, how about we get in touch your agent. You still with Jerry?
Yes, but...
Yes, but...
We'll work something out. I'm sure you'll be happy with it.
Bob, how long has Wes been working on this script?
I don't know. A couple months. Why?
I don't know. A couple months. Why?
And since you've been thinking of making it. Has anything funny happened?
And since you've been thinking of making it. Has anything funny happened?

Like weird calls, by any chance?
Might as well be, Dylan. State of the art animatronics enhanced with bio- organic grafting. Bull tendons, nerve bundles from a Doberman, even half the brain of a homicidal primate was...
Chase...
Just an earthquake, Dylan. Every once in a while we get a few.
No biggie, really.
One of mom's cups got broken.
I'm sorry. At least we're in on piece.
Dylan, it's breakfast. Not arts and crafts What?
You get any sleep last night?
You get any sleep last night?
More or less. Dylan, time to get dressed. I'm late.
Anything other than the obvious bothering you?
Five earthquakes in three weeks is enough.
Five earthquakes in three weeks is enough.
Hasn't been another call, has there?
Maybe. Or maybe I shouldn't do this interview today.
You've got to get back on the horse some time. Look, you've had a nutcase making harassing phone calls. I know how scary that feels.

No, you don't.
No, you don't.
Okay, but it still doesn't mean it can't be over with.
What if it isn't over?
Maybe you should tell me your dream.
It was nothing. We were both working on some movie, and a special effects thing went horribly wrong. Terry and Chuck were...hurt. You were almost... You were even cut.
You probably were half awake and saw me get nicked by that picture glass. Dreams work like that. You want me not to go on this job?

48 hours. Back before you know it.
Heather?
Chase. Hi...
What's up?
Chase, you'd better come home.
Chase, you'd better come home.
Heather, I'm stuck here. Neither Chuck or Terry came in today. I can't get away!
Heather, I'm stuck here. Neither Chuck or Terry came in today. I can't get away!
Chase, it's Dylan!
He's had some sort of...episode.
What? What kind of episode?

He was just acting very strange. He thinks somebody's after him, Chase. It's scary, it scared me. He was acting like...

Like Freddy.
Like Freddy.
Heather, has there been another call?
Chase. Why didn't Chuck or Terry show up?
Forget those two clowns, Heather. Answer me, did you get another call from that guy or not?
Yes.
I'll be there in three hours.
I'll be there in three hours.
Don't speed, Chase. It's not...
Any history of epilepsy in your family?
No.
No.
Diabetes?

No.
No.
Was there any trigger event? A trauma, shock or... You haven't shown him any of the films you make, have you? The horror stuff?
Was there any trigger event? A trauma, shock or... You haven't shown him any of the films you make, have you? The horror stuff?
No...
Does he have to stay here over night?
Absolutely.
Like what?
Sometimes what a child says or fantasizes will give a clue to what ails him. Did he say anything while he was still lucid?
Ms. Langenkamp. I'm afraid there are no evening visiting hours in Intensive Care.
Is he all right?
Is he all right?
Dylan? He's holding well. Earlier he had some problems, he's in an oxygen tent just now...
Dylan? He's holding well. Earlier he had some problems, he's in an oxygen tent just now...

It was an earthquake and it was dark. I have no idea.

These look quite fresh.

They are...it happened in tonight's quake. It happened just fifteen minutes ago. You must've felt it.
Doctor...
Get her back! I've got to go in! Get me a full anesthetic, STAT!
Ms. Langenkamp. I suggest you go home and get some rest. Your son is fine. He's been taken downstairs for further testing.
He was just here!
He was just here!
He was here. You fell asleep. We took him. You looked so exhausted, frankly, we didn't wake you. Besides, the young woman, Julie, is with him. Believe me, everything is fine.

Everything is not fine!
DO you mind...
Just a quick word, Ms. Langenkamp. For Dylan's sake.
I want my kid out of here now!
Very well. As soon as we gather the appropriate papers...
Very well. As soon as we gather the appropriate papers...
You don't understand. If Dylan falls asleep,then...
No way he's going anywhere. He's been well sedated.
He doesn't have to be awake to be on his feet.
He doesn't have to be awake to be on his feet.
What?
What?
He sleepwalks, you idiot! He's fully capable of walking out of this hospital. Oh my God...He thinks I've gone home...
no.
You have a fever, sweetie?
You going away?
Just for a few hours. Julie'll be with you.
Someone's coming.
What?
Dylan, I gotta go. Forgive me?
Bye.
Rex saved me.
Rex? Who's Rex?
"...as soon as the sun was up the witch made Gretel fetch the wood and kindle a fire. 'We will bake cookies first,' she said. 'I have heated the oven and kneaded the dough. Crawl in and see if the fire is blazing high enough now.' And she pushed Gretel toward the oven. The witch meant to shut the door and bake her once
Finish, please!
Finish, please!
This is going to give you nightmares.
This is going to give you nightmares.
I like this story.
Time for sleep.
Say how they find their way back home.
Tomorrow night.
No. Tonight. It's important!
"Then their father covered them with kisses and they were safe."
They were safe and could sleep.
Who?
The mean old man with the claws.
Okay, sweetie, night, night, sleep tight.
Don't let the bedbugs bite.
He's on his way.
He can follow the breadcrumbs, right?
He can follow the breadcrumbs, right?
Right.
Mommy's fine, Dylan. Just had a bad dream. What're you doing out of bed?
Rex woke me up. He was fighting.
Dylan, you go back to sleep now.
Not sleepy.
I can't sleep there, Mommy. Please!
You've got to sleep, Dylan, you...
In my bed.
Your bed?
Your bed?
Under my covers. Kids singing, and way down there, the man...the mean man...
And...what's the man doing?
Trying to get up...trying to get into our world.
Do you have to die to see God?
No, I don't think so. You just have to...pray, or reach...
Why does God let there be bad things?
I honestly don't know. Try to sleep, baby.
I honestly don't know. Try to sleep, baby.
Can you come with me in my dreams?
Home.
Home, that's right.
You okay, champ?
Can we go get Rex, now? The bad man's getting awful close.
Can we go get Rex, now? The bad man's getting awful close.
I know he is, sweetie. We'll both go get Rex right now.
Tell you what. I'm gonna go get Rex for you right now. You know home isn't far from here, right?
Right 'cross the freeway.
Right 'cross the freeway.
That's right. So I won't be long. Meanwhile Julie's gonna be right here with you.
Hurry back, please. I'm sleepy.
Promise. Cross my heart. But until Mommy gets back, Dylan, whatever you do, don't fall asleep.
You saw him, didn't you, Dylan!?
Coming for you...
Dylan, where's the man?
Here.
What...what is that?
A story?
Yes. It's a story. A story for a movie.
Read me some?
You okay?
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
Everything went great, I thought. We really got you, didn't we?
Everything went great, I thought. We really got you, didn't we?
I don't know why you didn't tell me, that's all.
In what, a romantic comedy?
Just because it's a love story doesn't mean it can't have a decapitation or two.
Heather? You doing okay?
Holding my own. You know that guy who was calling me all the time? He's started again. He's been putting stuff in my mail.

Must've read about the funeral. Sick mother. That's the last thing you need right now, I'm sure.
Must've read about the funeral. Sick mother. That's the last thing you need right now, I'm sure.
It's actually been giving me Freddy nightmares.
Darker. More...evil?
Yeah...how'd you know?
Yeah...how'd you know?
Call it a guess...
Anyway, what I was calling about was...have you seen any of the script, by any chance?
Wes won't show it until it's finished. That's what he told me, at least. I asked him at the funeral.
Wes won't show it until it's finished. That's what he told me, at least. I asked him at the funeral.
When do you think it'll be done?
When do you think it'll be done?
The way he's writing is so weird, who knows? I asked him how far he'd gotten at the funeral, and what was it he said...? Oh yeah, as far as Dylan trying to reach God. Weird, huh, that he'd have your kid in it?
What...happened?
Quake knocked you off your feet. You got bumped pretty good, actually.
I know what he's doing is bizarre, but most of the time he seems so normal, so well adjusted. I just can't believe it's him. I mean, and not something outside, influencing him. Or is that how denial works?
When it is denial. I don't think that's the case here, but if you're really worried, have a doctor check him out. You'll see, everything's fine.
You're not crazy, by the way.
Thinking I saw Freddy in the grave feels pretty crazy. And jumping in...
Thinking I saw Freddy in the grave feels pretty crazy. And jumping in...
You didn't jump in.

That's my memory. And it seemed absolutely real.

It's in my family, you know. My grandmother died in an institution...
It's in my family, you know. My grandmother died in an institution...
Really? Hell, if having a screwy family made you crazy, the world'd be one colossal nuthouse.
I've never mentioned it to him.
Kids know when something's bugging a parent. You've got no idea who this is calling?
Freddy, for all I know.
Steady...
A man, or a boy with a deep, y'know, Freddy voice.
Six weeks of this, and you're surprised you've got Freddy in your dreams? Hell, Sonny Bono says after a while he was seeing his stalker everywhere. Even at Mass.

Absolutely. And how many times has Letterman called the cops thinking that woman was down in his kitchen again? It gets under your skin if you let it.

You really think Dylan's okay?
John Saxon. Do you have any idea what time it is?
John. It's Heather. I need help!
John. It's Heather. I need help!
You got it. What's happening?
You got it. What's happening?
Dylan's run away from the hospital. I don't know whether he's wandering around or heading for the house. But I think Freddy's after him. I know it sounds crazy!
Dylan's run away from the hospital. I don't know whether he's wandering around or heading for the house. But I think Freddy's after him. I know it sounds crazy!
You're right. That sounds crazy!
You're right. That sounds crazy!
John. Will you please just look for him around the hospital? I'm gonna go right to the house. Will you help me, John? Please!
Holy...
Where's Dylan?! Have you seen him?
I know how Chase really died.
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
Fred Krueger did it.
Fred Krueger did it.
Yeah, sure.
Heather Langenkamp?
Yes?
Yes?
Is Chase Porter your husband?
Is Chase Porter your husband?
Yes.
Yes.
I'm afraid there was an accident. It appears he fell asleep while driving, ma'am.
I want to see the body.
No, you don't, ma'am, it's not necessary.
No, you don't, ma'am, it's not necessary.
I want to see for myself.
Studio B.
Hi. This is Heather Langenkamp.
Hi. This is Heather Langenkamp.
The car's no there yet?
The car's no there yet?
No. I...listen, I can't make it in today.
No. I...listen, I can't make it in today.
You're kidding, right?
I'm sorry, I can't.
Listen, dammit.
Listen, dammit.
I just can't.
Yeah, Julie, I'm sorry. I just thought...there was an earthquake, I think. Little one, but...
Big truck went right by before you opened the door. Life on the Fault Line.
Heather, what is it?
Dunno. Just have this feeling today...
I'll call the cops for you. You've got the number on the fridge, right?
Thanks. Just give them the time he called. They're keeping a list, supposedly. Sorry. My nerves are so raw these days.
Thanks. Just give them the time he called. They're keeping a list, supposedly. Sorry. My nerves are so raw these days.
'S okay.
No, Rex is not going to die. Julie, you know where the sewing stuff is, don't you?
Sure. We'll do an operation, Doctor Dylan and Doctor Julie. We'll fix him good as new.
No, I don't think that at all. How is he?
They wouldn't let me...
I can tell you what the nightmares are about. They're about this...entity. Whatever you want to call it. It's old, very old, and it's taken different forms in different times. The only thing that stays the same about it is what it lives for.
What's that?
What's that?
Killing innocence, one way or the other.
This is still a script we're talking about, right?
I think of it as sort of a nightmare in progress.
Then, in this nightmare in progress, does this thing have any weaknesses?
It can be captured, sometimes.
It can be captured, sometimes.
Captured? How?
Captured? How?
By storytellers, of all things. Every so often, they imagine a story good enough to catch its essence. Then it's held prisoner for a while. In the story.
Like the Genie in the bottle.
Exactly. The problem comes when the story dies. It happens a lot of different ways, the story gets too familiar, or too watered down by people trying to make it easier to sell, or ti's labeled a threat to society and just plain banned. However it happens, when the story dies, the evil is set free.
You saying Freddy's this ancient thing?
Current version. For ten years he's been imprisoned as Freddy by the story of Nightmare on Elm Street. But now that the films have stopped- The genie's out of the bottle, Heather, that's what the nightmares are about. That's what I'm writing.
If Freddy's loose, I mean, in your script, where's he going to go? Another age? Another form?
That's not what the dreams say he's doing.
That's not what the dreams say he's doing.
Then what is he doing?
Then what is he doing?
Well, see, he's gotten used to being Freddy now. And kinda likes it here in our time and space, too. So...he's trying to cross over, from film into our reality.
Isn't there anyone that can stop him?
Interestingly enough, in the dreams there is one person. A gatekeeper, so to speak. Someone Freddy's got to get by before he can enter our world. It's you, Heather.

Me? Why me?
Me? Why me?
Dramatically speaking it makes perfect sense. You played Nancy, after all, the first to humiliate and defeat him.
Dramatically speaking it makes perfect sense. You played Nancy, after all, the first to humiliate and defeat him.
That was Nancy, not me!
That was Nancy, not me!
But it was you that gave Nancy her strength. So to get out he has to come through you. And it's inevitable that he'll hit you at your most vulnerable points...
Dylan. And... Chase. My God, Wes, did you know?
Heather, it's just a movie, a dream, really...
Heather, it's just a movie, a dream, really...
You know damn well it's more than that now! How can we stop him?
The way to stop him is to make another movie. And I swear to you I'll stay at my computer and keep writing until I finish the script. But when that time comes... You're gonna have to make a choice.
Choice? What kind of choice?
Choice? What kind of choice?
Whether or not you're willing to play Nancy one last time.
I don't know if it has, really. With the exception of One and Three, I've pretty much kept out of it. I'm working in television now. The hours let me spend more time with my husband and little boy.
Now that you have a child, is it possible you've decided horror is bad for children?

Do you let your child watch your movies?
Do you let your child watch your movies?

Of course he is. Freddy's dead and gone.
And how about your co-star in NIGHTMARE I. Would you trust him alone with your child?
And how about your co-star in NIGHTMARE I. Would you trust him alone with your child?
Robert? I...
Robert? I...
Maybe we should ask him, hmmm? We've got a surprised, Heather. A great big surprise for you and our audience.
Yes?
Heather, this is Sara Risher over at New Line. How are you?
Heather, this is Sara Risher over at New Line. How are you?
Oh, hi. I'm fine, Sara. My God, a voice from the past!
Oh, hi. I'm fine, Sara. My God, a voice from the past!
Really! Listen, Heather, I won't take but a minute of your time. It's just that we have something to propose to you, and wonder if you'd stop by the offices. Bob'd love to talk to you.
Really! Listen, Heather, I won't take but a minute of your time. It's just that we have something to propose to you, and wonder if you'd stop by the offices. Bob'd love to talk to you.
Uh...sure...when?
Uh...sure...when?
No time like the present. The car will bring you.
No time like the present. The car will bring you.
Now?
Now?
Just take a minute. You'll be glad you did, I bet.
Can I get you something to drink?
Coffee'd be nice.
Coffee'd be nice.
Sounds good. Kim, would you get Heather and me a coffee? How you like it, Hon?
Sounds good. Kim, would you get Heather and me a coffee? How you like it, Hon?
Black's fine.
Black's fine.
Me too.
Did we lose anybody?
Not yet.
That low passed through last night. May be a little bumpy out there.
It's time these boys saw some real blue water.
Looks like weather.
Yep.
He would have loved this.
Your father?
Your father?
All his years at sea, he never stopped talking about these islands.
All his years at sea, he never stopped talking about these islands.
You miss him.
I'd have liked to have said goodbye.
He knows.
He knows.
You sound so sure.
You sound so sure.
I am about this.
What?
He never would have believed a woman like you existed.
Do you remember the last time you and I danced under the stars?
Guilty.
Guilty.
On the deck of the Yankee, the night you asked me to marry you. We weren't much older than they are.
You may not like what you hear.
I can take it.
I can take it.
They've become what you wanted. They're a crew. That's why he came.
Why did we begin this?
We were idealists.
We were idealists.
Because we believed we could make an impact out here. Self reliance and community through the disciplines of sailing.

I haven't forgotten.

Phil, he's not looking inside. He's just striking out at the world.

He has a lot of hurt inside him.

Well, he better learn to own it. Actions have consequences. It's not what happens here Alice, it's what they take away with them.
What are they doing?
Claiming their place in the world.
Oh I was walkin' down Lime street one day...
Hey! Weigh! Blow the man down...
Hey! Weigh! Blow the man down...
A pretty young maiden she happened my way...
A pretty young maiden she happened my way...
Give me some time to blow the man down...
So to all you sailors who've fought wind and whale...
Weight! Hey! Blow the man down...
Weight! Hey! Blow the man down...
She said "None the better, you all go to hell..."
She said "None the better, you all go to hell..."
Give me some time to Blow the man down!
Everyone aboard young Bill?
Yes, Sir.
Yes, Sir.
Good. Let's go sailing.
We'll bear off to port and run down wind.
Mr. Lawford, stand by to ease the mainsheet. Rick, get on the jib sheet. George, John, Philip, Tim and Dick go aloft to unstop the forecourse. George will show you what to do. Tod, show your men the forward pinrail and stand ready on the buntlines and clewlines. Forecourse first... work upward.
Raise the inner jib! Raise the forestaysail!
Watch the tell-tales Chuck. If we jibe now we'll have a lot of people in the water.
Why wasn't I made aware of this Bill?
I didn't know sir.
I didn't know sir.
It's your job to know. If something goes wrong up there, the other eighteen people aboard can't be wondering if he's gonna do his job or not.
Come in.
Skipper, uh, the crew is pretty much doing group boot over the side.
Skipper, uh, the crew is pretty much doing group boot over the side.
Well, that's all part of it.
Well, that's all part of it.
We've got weather moving in from the west.
Everyone out of the rigging NOW!
Everybody down! ON THE DOUBLE!!
Carry on.
Yes sir.
Yes sir.
North, north-east. And Dick, please make a note of our final position.
Why didn't you drop any sail?
Skipper called us out of the rigging.
Skipper called us out of the rigging.
But your instinct was to lose sail?

My instinct was to not get electrocuted.

How old are you, son?
How old are you, son?
Fifteen.
Fifteen.
Thank you.
Okay, here's the duty. Gieg, Weathers, Lapchick, Schucart: scrape and paint. Corry and Stricklin have the brass. Robinson, you're the Galley slave. March you're on chain gang with Barnes. Johnston, solo on bilge detail.
Butler, what'd I ever do to you?
Butler, what'd I ever do to you?
You came back, Tod. You came back.
It didn't go over 'til I turned her starboard!
It was an act of God for Christ's sake.
There's still a way.
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
It's me, don't you see. Terry's right, I'm the escape hatch. I disobeyed order.
Make us proud.
Yes sir.
Where's Mom?
I couldn't bring her down here until I knew you were safe.
I thought we'd find a store, get you fixed up and then get you some lunch. That sound good?
Yeah, sure.
Why don't you go and try some of that on?
Okay.
Fine.
All right. I'm gonna wander over and look at some shoes...
When we were growing up I always felt like you would take care of things, that everything would be okay. But you can't make this okay, can you?
No, I can't.
Albatross?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Rick March. Who the hell are you?
Rick March. Who the hell are you?
Gieg, Chuck.
Gieg, Chuck.
Look, meet us out front when you're through. If they try to take anything away from you like Johnny Quest up there, just make a list and we'll have 'em send it down to the boat.

Whatever.
What the "Bowsprit Affair"?
Well, Romeo here was on harbor watch and managed to sweet talk one of the local girls to have a go in the bowsprit.
She isn't that old.
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
I mean she looks pretty damn good in her all-together for being thirty.
I walked in on my parents one time. It was only like eight o'clock and they were in bed and I thought that was kinda weird so I just walked in.
That's what they get for not locking the door.
That's what they get for not locking the door.
So I'm standing there and you could hear a pin drop. No breathing or snoring... Suddenly it hits me that somethin' was goin' on that just stopped, really fast, like people are holding their breath.
Yeah.
My old man split along time ago. It doesn't mean anything. You just take care of number one that's all that matters.
Where you going?
To take a piss.
Yeah, that's right. You wanna come in and shake it for me?
If you're gonna cheat, you might as well copy off somebody who's gonna get the answer right.
If you're gonna cheat, you might as well copy off somebody who's gonna get the answer right.
You've gotta be kidding. Get the fuck outta my way!
I cheated to get on the boat!!! All right?!
What?
I doctored my grades so I'd make the cut. I'm a moron, okay? You satisfied?!
You're not a moron.
You're not a moron.
Wanna bet? Takes me half a day to get through one chapter of Lawford and I still don't have any idea what the hell he's talkin' about. You know why it takes me so long to write papers? because I can't spell. While everybody else is sleeping, I'm in the rack with a flashlight and a dictionary.
They were gonna put me into special- ed this year. I stole a copy of my transcript, changed all the grades. Shit, who am I kidding. I'll never pass the boards.
Listen, you don't cheat, and we'll make sure you get the grades. We'll start a private study group. Nobody knows. You'll ace that test.
Bregitta. Do you believe it?
Believe what?
Believe what?
Her name. Bregitta. It's poetry.
You okay?
Yeah. How'd you do.
Ninety-six.
Congratulations.
Congratulations.
What about you?
It's a ninety-one! It's an 'A'!
I know.
I know.
You know? Then why are you up here looking like you're about to jump overboard?!

I just can't believe it.
I just can't believe it.
This is your moment, don't you see? The instant when you know that your life is never going to be the same again. When you stand up and are counted.
I couldn't have done it without you.
Yes you could. You did. This is all you. Nobody else.
Feels different doesn't it?
What?
What?
That we're going back. I don't want it to end. I don't want to be what I was when I left.
That we're going back. I don't want it to end. I don't want to be what I was when I left.
What was that?
What was that?
Anonymous.
I've been getting ninety-sixes my whole life. It's what they expect. After all this, I still haven't figured it out.
Figured what out?
Figured what out?
Who I am, outside of this boat. What the hell I'm doing here.
Who I am, outside of this boat. What the hell I'm doing here.
I'll tell you who you are. You're the glue. You're the thing that holds everybody around you together. You're strong, you listen and you see things in people the rest of us can't. It's a gift.
You know, I never had friends like this.
Me either.
Me either.
I feel like... we can do anything.
You gonna jump? Or are you just having a last look?
I was just thinking that I never had a new pair of shoes till I was twelve.

It's no my fault I was born first. Besides, nobody ever sent me on an eight month vacation, so ease up on the sad sack stuff.

Why then.

Because it looks good.
I'm just not like you. Ya know? I'm never going to go to Yale. I'm never going to be "William".
Nobody says you have to be like me.
Nobody says you have to be like me.
He does.
He does.
You don't give him enough credit Chas.
Hey, shut up will ya?
It was a bad dream...
God damn it man. I think he broke my nose!
Shut up, Phil.
Yeah, but how are you supposed to make the first move?
Like this!
Why'd you do it?
What's the difference?
What's the difference?
You only hurt yourself you know?
You only hurt yourself you know?
Like you really care. Like any of you give a shit what happens to me.
Can we talk?
I guess.
Everybody's saying this whole tribunal is happening because of your father. Because of you.
Well that's just typical isn't it?
Well that's just typical isn't it?
Is it true Phil?

I gotta go.
I gotta go.
You weren't there, you don't know what happened.
You weren't there, you don't know what happened.
I know enough.
Sorry to here it.
Well, and it's pretty cool too, ya know? Bein' here together an all...
Listen man, I think I have a problem.
We all have problems.
We all have problems.
I'm pissin' fire man.
You taking the order wouldn't have changed anything.
They don't know that. We were the only one's on deck. Look, there's nothing they can do to me right? I'm a kid.
They don't know that. We were the only one's on deck. Look, there's nothing they can do to me right? I'm a kid.
But that's not the point...
But that's not the point...
That is the point... And Skipper'll slip off the hook.
Honey, did you know that the Albatross was captured by the Germans during World War II?
No, I didn't.
No, I didn't.
It says she was originally Schooner rigged, but Captain Sheldrake turned her into a brigantine. I think square rigs look so much more romantic.

Me too.
Do you have your ticket?
Yes.
Yes.
Passport?
Passport?
Look, I just better go.
Goodbye Mom. I'll be okay.
I know you will.
What the hell is going on?
Maybe it's an air raid.
Jesus.
I can't watch this.
How ya doing?
Fine.
Fine.
Good.
Good.
Look, I appreciate, you know, the concern and all, but like he said, I can take care of myself.
Look, I appreciate, you know, the concern and all, but like he said, I can take care of myself.
I just brought you something to eat.
I feel like I got you into this.
Forget it.
Forget it.
I'm used to spending a lot of time alone. I guess that's what I thought it would be out here. But, it's not is it?
I'm used to spending a lot of time alone. I guess that's what I thought it would be out here. But, it's not is it?
I'm sorry I left you hanging up there.
I'm sorry I left you hanging up there.
It doesn't matter. Really. I'm just sorry you got chewed out.
You think Skipper and Alice do it?
Do what?
Do what?
Ya know... "It".
Ya know... "It".
That's like wondering if your mom and dad do it. Who wants to know?
No way!
Come on man, what'd they look like?
So... What happened?
My mother says in this really low, but very awake kind of voice "What?"
What'd you do?
I said "Sorry, wrong room" and walked away.
My parents don't do it anymore.
How do you know? They might.
How do you know? They might.
'Cause they're getting a divorce. That's why they sent me here. My sister's at Tabor. They just wanted us out of the house so they could get down to business.
Where are you from any way?
Depths of hell... Ohio. How 'bout you?
Depths of hell... Ohio. How 'bout you?
Kennet Square, PA. 'Mushroom capital of the world'.
It was so real...
Here's the thing; whenever you're having a nightmare, all you have to do is say 1-2-3 wake up! You'll be out of it. You'll wake up.
Who told you that?
My dad.
My dad.
It works?
It works?
Swear to God. Only good advice he ever gave me. Now, go back to sleep.
That's how he died you know.
Who?
Who?
My brother. He fell out of the old beech tree. Broke his neck. I was on a camp out. They started going at it, throwin' things, a real knock down... They didn't find him 'till the next morning. They didn't even know why he was up there.

Jesus, you never told them?
Jesus, you never told them?
I couldn't.
What are they doing?
I can't make it out?
I can't go in there.
What are you talking about.
Hold her steady into the wind. Southwest by west.
Yes sir.
Yes sir.
Gentleman, when you hear an order, sing out. I want to know that you've heard and understand. Raise the mainsail.
Ah... Northeast... sir.
Speak up boy!
Northeast sir!
Unfurl the squares!
Yes, sir.
All stop on the engine.
You all right?
It was my fault. I slipped.
Remember something, sooner or later... we all have to face it.
Face what?
Uh, huh.
Would you, um, say it's a big storm?
Would you, um, say it's a big storm?
Sometimes it gets exciting out here.
Shouldn't we turn away?
You can't run from the wind son. You trim your sails, face the music and let the chips fall. Bill, let's close her up, dog, tight.
What's on your mind?
I'm here on behalf of the crew, sir.
Well, spit it out.
The fact is... We'd like you to give Phil another chance.
Can't do it.
Sir...?
Sir...?
Close the door. Sit down.
Why do you think I'm sending him home?
He killed the dolphin.
The Dolphin was a symptom.
Of what?
Of what?
Of a fight he can't win out here.
Of a fight he can't win out here.
It's his father sir. He's suffocating him. We've all seen it...
I mean he has all these expectations and he doesn't even know who his own kid is. What right did then have to show up here?
They have every right Chuck.
They have every right Chuck.
They send us because they want us to change, or grow up or something and then they try to keep us the same.
Does Phil know how you guys feel?
I don't know.
I don't know.
You should tell him. That's something he can take with him.
Chicken is a fool's game captain.
So is violating international law.

But you invited is aboard.

Your cannons made a compelling argument.
Stow away?
He left his passport in Curacao. It's being mailed to Panama.
He left his passport in Curacao. It's being mailed to Panama.
That is unfortunate. We'll have to take him with us.
Why didn't you turn hard to port as the wind hit?
I thought we'd have a better chance if I headed into the wind so we could spill air from our sails.
But the Captain ordered you hard to starboard.
Twice.
Twice.
Is that what you were trained to do?
Is that what you were trained to do?
No.
No.
Then what do you think he was trying to do.
Then what do you think he was trying to do.
Let the blow drive the boat down wind. Neutralize our canvas.
So when the captain gave you an order contrary to your training, you thought he was making a mistake?
No.
Albatross? Doesn't inspire a lot of confidence.
Oh, on the contrary, the Albatross is considered a very good omen. It is said they embody the spirits of sailors passed on. It's very bad luck if you kill one. And dolphins too.
I'm Francis Boutillier. This is my son, Philip.
I know.
Your cable said you wouldn't be putting out until mid-October.
As you can see, there's a lot to do.
As you can see, there's a lot to do.
Indentured servitude is not what my son had in mind.
Indentured servitude is not what my son had in mind.
This is a working ship. Promptness is not a luxury, it's a necessity, as is the work to maintain her. Had we been ready, I can assure you we would have sailed.
And I would have expected compensation for my time and expense coming all the way down here.
Happily, it all worked out... This time. Bill, take Philip below and help him find a bunk.
I'll be frank with you. This was his mother's idea. A romp through the Caribbean on a sailboat sounds more like a vacation than an education if you ask me.
It will be more than that, I can promise you.
It will be more than that, I can promise you.
Take good care of my son.
We'll do our best. You're welcome to say goodbye.
He's a big boy.
Well, we thought we'd drop in and see if you were all still in one piece.
And, of course, we are.
And, of course, we are.
Well, you never can tell these days, can you?
What is it we can do for you today?
Well, we've come to give our boy a little break from the monotony.
What's wrong, you don't like steak?
I should be eating with the crew.
I should be eating with the crew.
Humor me. Eat it anyway.
Humor me. Eat it anyway.
Why are you here?
Spying?!
I can take care of myself.
I can take care of myself.
Oh, really?
Oh, really?
Look, you put me on this boat in the first place. I didn't want to come but I did. Why do you have to embarrass me. Why can't you just leave me alone?
Listen to me, you thankless little prick. We're your parents, so don't you dare talk to me disrespectfully. What the hell is it, this captain? Because I'll see him in a rowboat...
It has nothing to do with him.
It has nothing to do with him.
Well, what does it have to do with? Us?
Well, what does it have to do with? Us?
No. Look, it's me okay? Can't it just be about me? For once?
Who is it Philip?
It's okay. I'll be in, in a minute. Look, what do you want?
I think you were too hard on Weathers.
You do?
You do?
Yes. I do.
I need to know what I'm working with; what their boundaries are. Their lives depend on it, and for that matter so does yours. We've got to bring them together. Make them a crew. We're as strong as our weakest link and I don't want to find that out the hard way. So, I will challenge them and they will come together.
Yes sir.
Yes sir.
You know the best thing about being a Skipper is the worst thing. It's all my responsibility. So I'll tell you what George, you stay off of my bridge, and I'll stay out of your galley. We'll get along that way.
What?! What's happening?!!
You're officer of the watch, George.
You're officer of the watch, George.
I'm sorry, Skip. It's this damned book. Lawford gave it to me.
Son-of-a-bitch.
We're short one long boat too. Come on.
I guess we know what the next acquisition for the galley is going to be...
What's that?
What's that?
A padlock.
Immortality.
Spirits have a way of bringing that out.
Spirits have a way of bringing that out.
And being sixteen.
And being sixteen.
They're in a hurry to grow up. They don't know about consequences or responsibility. That's being sixteen too. I promise you one thing...
They're in a hurry to grow up. They don't know about consequences or responsibility. That's being sixteen too. I promise you one thing...
What's that?
What's that?
They'll know about it in the morning.
Jesus. She's got guns.
She's Cuban.
They think we're carrying Cuban refugees. Skipper, they mean to board us.
Not a chance. Remind them that according to the Geneva Convention, firing on a civilian vessel on the high sea is an act of war.
Oh Jesus, oh Jesus. Man I knew we shouldn't have gone. I tried to tell you. I tried to tell you. You guys made me come! You made me come!!
Will you shut up? You sound like my fucking sister.
Yeah, well you're really gonna have some bad dreams if we find out you didn't.
That's enough.
That's enough.
How the hell are we gonna get outta here?
How the hell are we gonna get outta here?
We'll think of something.
We'll think of something.
Oh, praise the lord. Relax everybody. Everything is under control. The jug head's going to think of something.
Hell, they even kicked me outa vo- tech 'cause I couldn't read a slide rule.
I can show you how to use a slide rule.
Me, too.
Why would you do that?
Jesus! What the hell happened to him.
Lemme go! Lemme go!!
What's your problem?
Why'd you jump?
Why'd you jump?
Because I felt like it. What do you care?
Because I felt like it. What do you care?
I couldn't do it.
I couldn't do it.
Well, as soon as you grow some balls, let me know.
Don't ever call me stupid.
Come on, he didn't mean anything.
I'll read it. I mean I don't mind.
Shut up donut.
If you've got "a broad" available I'll take her.
Like you'd know what to do with one.
How would you know?
Trust me donut. I know.
Trust me donut. I know.
What? Come on...
What? Come on...
On the dog watch, night after the storm, I look down into the skylight above Skipper's cabin and there she was, peelin' down.
Damn, Porkchop, you sound just like a guy who ain't never seen a pair.
I've seen 'em. I've seen 'em.
They tell you that?
I figured it out.
It matters to me.
Okay donut. Whatever you say.
Why, man?
I don't have to listen to this.
I don't.
You will if you wanna eat. Right George?
That's not a satisfactory answer.
Look, save it for somebody else will ya. This ancient shit doesn't have anything to do with me.
Much have I traveled in realms of gold/ And many goodly states and kingdoms seen/ Round many western islands have I been/ Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold/ Oft of one wide expanse had I been told/ That deep-browed Homer ruled as his demesne.
You know what he is talking about here?
This isn't just a story!! It's history made allegory. It is a philosophical handbook for life! It holds the secret of this very voyage.
What is it... the secret?
What?
If it were only that simple, my young friend. Read on, gentlemen. Read on.
The rust won't wait for you to read Conrad, Goodall.
Then he shouldn't have written such a long poem, Mr. Lawford.
Then he shouldn't have written such a long poem, Mr. Lawford.
Read on, young John. Read on. College boards are coming.
Well, that was neighborly.
He didn't get to be Under Secretary of the Air Force by being neighborly.
What's wrong Mr. Lawford.
It seems we're short on singers.
Tie it off!!
Outer.
What do you think?
Barometer's dropping. The first blow'll come from the south. Might get interesting.
We've got a problem.
What's that?
What's that?
Terry left his passport in Curacao. We could hide him...
Terry left his passport in Curacao. We could hide him...
No. Bring him on deck with the others.
If he's a Cuban, Castro wears a dress.
Nobody aboard my ship is going anywhere.
You gotta be kidding? He's a human chum line!
No self respecting shark is gonna take a bite out of you.
They're waving... handkerchiefs or something.
What?
Fuck off man. It's just a fish.
No, Phil. It's a mammal.
You're the one who doesn't care, Phil.
It hurts too much to care.
It hurts too much to care.
About yourself?
About yourself?
About anything.
How long you been standing there?
Long enough.
What are we supposed to talk about?
You've gotta be kidding?
You've gotta be kidding?
But, they don't speak English.
But, they don't speak English.
There are some things that everybody does in the same language.
Phil. What are you doing?
Fandango, Junior. I'm gonna do some limbo baby!!
Fandango, Junior. I'm gonna do some limbo baby!!
No way Phil. Not like this.
No way Phil. Not like this.
Roger Meris, steps up, it's a corker down the pipe...
It's outta here!
Come on man. Let's just talk about it.
I don't know. We gotta get 'im outta here before Skipper sees him like this.
Son of a bitch!!
You're a day late. We keep a schedule aboard ship. Lives depend on it. Hello, Philip.
Sir.
Suicidal...
The first thing is I don't like people talking when I'm talking so the two of you, shut up.
Do you have something to say?
No.
No.
Then keep your mouth shut.
No, sir.
Excellent. Bill, find Mr. Weathers a position to suit his condition.
Do me a favor and tell Bill once she's dogged down I want everyone to break out their slickers and make sure their gear is stowed or we'll spend the next week sorting underwear. Lawford, Bill, Mike, John, and Phil will stand the watch. Everyone else hit the racks.
I'm not staying out here.
I have arranged to host a good will cruise for the Dutch students of the local school there.
Joy, rapture...
Joy, rapture...
Each one of you will be responsible for one student. I'll expect you to be courteous. You represent this school and your country. We'll sail in the morning.
I'm not gonna kill it.
You already have. Now go on. Do it.
Swing up, son.
What?
What?
Up you go. Right now.
What's it going to be?
I'm sorry...
I'm sorry...

No big buildings like in New Orleans.
Whattaya do there?
I thought you two were in Austin, Texas. Or Takes-us, as they say in these parts.
We were. Now Mr. San Pedro Sula and I are on our way back to Utila, in the morning.
So, it's back to the islands.
Yes. Mr. San Pedro Sula spoke yesterday to his son, Archibald Leach San Pedro Sula, who is named after Cary Grant, and he told them there was a shooting.
But how are you finding New Orleans, Senor Farragut?
Call me Johnnie... N.O. has always been a good town to sit around in.
Mr. San Pedro Sula is from Honduras.

Was in all the papers three years ago. I'm seventy-six, was only seventy- three then. Had a business in Buffalo, New York, called Rats With Wings. Killed pigeons for anyone who wanted 'em killed.
If your neighbors didn't mind, how'd you get put out of business?
Woman drivin' down the street spotted me with on a roof with my rifle. She called the police and they came over and arrested me. Thought I was a sniper! Boys at the VFW loved that one. Cops didn't understand about the pigeons, the damage they do to personal property. I used to complain to the city but they never lifted a finger. I

You are from New Orleans, Senor Farragut?
Johnnie, please. Nope. Charlotte, North Carolina. Here on business.
Only that it's supposed to be a pretty poor sight since the hurricane came through last year.
Yes, that's so. But there is not much to destroy.
In what capacity?
In many capacities.
General Osvaldo Tamarindo y Ramirez. Telefono 666.
He is my sponsor. The General is the head of the secret police of Honduras.
Why are you in New Orleans? If you don't mind my askin'.
Certainly not. We are here only briefly, in fact, until this evening, when we fly to Austin, Texas to visit a friend of mine who is an agent for the CIA.
The same to you. If you are in Honduras, come to the Bay Islands and visit us. The Hondurans are great friends of the American people. But I have a joke for you before I go. If a liberal, a socialist, and a communist all jumped off the roof of the Empire State Building at the same time, which one of them would hit
I couldn't say, which one?
Would you like to enjoy a martini with us?
Why not? How was the fishin'?
Why not? How was the fishin'?
I think they are too serious, these American fishermen. In Honduras, we are not so concerned with the method.
Teddy Roosevelt, one of the local shrimp boat captains is in jail now. These people are friends of mine, so I must return and find out what happened.

Do you know how it came about that copper wire was invented in Scotland?
How's that?
Gotta admit, you guys are - two in four dozen.
The real joke is we never went fishing, but we're still fishing.
I forgot to show you this. The gentlemen that gave this to me said you'd recognize it. Said he wanted it'd be 'bout the last thing you ever saw in this life.
Oh God... OH GOD... Santos... Oh God Marietta... are you in on this?... OH GOD!!!
I knew this would happen. Soon as that piece of filth got out of Pee Dee, I knew there'd be trouble. He's just got some kind of influence over her I can't decipher. There's somethin' wild in Lula I don't know where it comes from. You gotta find 'em, Johnnie.
He served his time for what he did. Another thing... If Lula went with him of her own volition - willingly, that is - there ain't much can be done about it.

Don't talk down to me, Johnnie Farragut. I know what volition means, and that's why I want Sailor Ripley off the planet! He's pure slime and it's leakin' all over my baby. Maybe you could push him into makin' some kinda move and then kill him dead. You'd only be defendin' yourself, and with his record, nobody'd fuss.
I'll hire a hit man if you don't want to help me stop this thing. I'll call Marcello Santos.
Now, Marietta, I am goin' to help you. And don't be gettin' carried away. You don't want to be bringin' Santos and his people into it.

Sailor ain't a murderer. You got to get off that kick. And far's I can tell, Sailor was entire clean prior to that involvin' Lula. Even there he was protectin' her. You oughta be thankin' him for that. That Bob Ray Lemon they say was comin' after the both of 'em. Why am I tellin' you this, you was around that night. You ought
Maybe I was there, but I didn't see anythin'. All I know's that trash killed a man with his bare hands. Hands which are now prob'ly all over my baby!
Marietta, settle down now darlin'... I want what's best for her, too - like I said, I'll do what I can to bring her home.
No, Marietta, I haven't found 'em.
This is the kinda mistake can take a Hindu's lifetime to unfix... You better get a move on, Johnnie, before that boy got her holdin' down a Memphis streetcorner and shootin' dope up her arms.
Really, Marietta, you got more scenarios swimmin' around in your brain than Carter got pills. Try to take it easy. Go over to Myrtle Beach for a few days.
I'm stayin' right here by the phone until you find Lula, then I'm comin' to get her. You call soon's you got somethin', even if it's three in the a.m.

Listen, Johnnie, Lula just called me. She knew you were in N.O., so they left the city.

Did she tell you where she was callin' from?
Did she tell you where she was callin' from?
No, but my guess is they're headed west, so prob'ly Texas. Their money must be runnin' low. I don't think Sailor had much to begin with, if any, and Lula took the six hundred she had saved in the Cherokee Thrift.

Don't give me no trouble now, Pace, please. This ain't the easiest day in a long time. And what do you mean how are we gonna know what your daddy looks like? You seen his photo.
How'll he know what we look like? He seen our photo?
Damn it, child! Now look what you made me do.
What I made you do, mama?
Nothin', honey. Mama's just actin' strange.
You ain't actin', mama.
You ain't actin', mama.
Why, Pace Roscoe Ripley, ain't you got one cute mouth tonight?
I still ain't sure what my daddy looks like.
Like you, sweetheart. You and your daddy got the same mouth, eyes, ears, and nose. Only difference is your color hair is like mine.

Grandmama said how Sailor murdered a man.
Grandmama said how Sailor murdered a man.
Wrong, baby. Your daddy never committed no murder. Musta been you didn't hear grandmama proper. He made some mistakes, is all. Your daddy ain't always been so lucky... We're almost at the depot, honey. Sit back a minute.
Why we sittin' here, mama?
Thinkin' a second, baby.
I'm scared, mama.
Why, honey?
Why, honey?
Case daddy don't like me. What if he don't like that I don't got his color hair.
Case daddy don't like me. What if he don't like that I don't got his color hair.
Pace, your daddy'd love you even if you didn't have no hair at all.
Hey baby...
Peanut...
Hey, my snakeskin jacket... Thanks, baby... Did I ever tell you that this here jacket for me is a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom?
'Bout fifty thousand times. I got us a room at the Cape Fear, and guess what?... I hear Powermad's at "The Hurricane."

Stab it and steer.
Did you ever think somethin' like about the wicked witch of the east comin' flyin' in?... Did you ever think somethin' and then later think you've said it out loud to someone?
I really did miss your mind while I was out at Pee Dee, honey. The rest of you, too, of course. But the way your head works is God's own private mystery. What was it you was thinkin'?

Well, I was thinkin' about smokin' actually... My mama smokes Marlboros now, used to be she smoked Kools? I stole 'em from her beginnin' in about sixth grade. When I got old enough to buy my own, I bought those. Now I've just about settled on Mores, as you probably noticed? They're longer.

I guess I started smokin' when I was about six... My mama was already dead from lung cancer...

Camels, same as me... Guess both my mama and my daddy died of smoke or alcohol related illness.

Gee, Sailor. I'm sorry, honey. I never would have guessed it.

It's okay. I hardly used to see them anyway. I didn't have much parental guiding. The public defender kept sayin' that at my parole hearin'. He was a good ol' boy, stood by me... Even brought me some cartons of cigarettes from time to time.

I'd stand by you, Sailor... through anything.

Hell, peanut, you stuck with me after I planted Bob Ray Lemon. A man can't ask for more than that.
You're perfect for me, too.
You remind me of my daddy, you know? Mama told me he liked skinny women whose breasts were just a bit too big for their bodies. He had a long nose, too, like theirs. Did I ever tell you how he died?

In a fire, as I recall.

Started he couldn't remember things? Got real violent? Mama kept tellin' me it was on account of lead poisoning from cleanin' the old paint off our house without usin' a mask... But I don't know. Seems like his brain just fell apart in pieces.
You have such a pretty, long neck, like a swan.
Grandmama Pace had a long, smooth white neck. It was like on a statue it was so white?
Sailor, you are somethin' else, honey... When I was fifteen, Mama told me that pretty soon I'd be startin' to think about sex, and I should talk to her before I did anything about it.
But honey, I thought you told me your Uncle Pooch raped you when you was thirteen.

That's true. Uncle Pooch wasn't really an uncle. He was a business partner of my daddy's? And my mama never knew nothin' about me and him - that's for damn sure. His real name was somethin' kind of European, like Pucinski. But everyone just called him Pooch. He came around the house sometimes when Daddy was away. I always figured he was sweet on

How'd it happen, peanut? He just pull out the old toad and let it croak?
You're terrible crude sometimes, Sailor, you know?
I can't hardly understand you when you talk with one of them Mores in your mouth.
I said you can be too crude sometimes? I don't think I care for it.
Sorry, sugar. Go on and tell me how old Pooch done the deed.
Sorry, sugar. Go on and tell me how old Pooch done the deed.
Well, mama was at the Busy Bee havin' her hair dyed? And I was alone in the house.
Uncle Pooch came in the side door through the porch, you know? Where I was makin' a jelly and banana sandwich? I remember I had my hair in curlers cause I was goin' that night with Vicki and Cherry Ann, the DeSoto sisters. Uncle Pooch must have known nobody but me was home, cause he came right in and put both his hands on
Didn't he say somethin'?
So how'd he finally nail you? Right there in the kitchen?
No, he picked me up.
He was short but powerful. With hairy arms? Anyway, he carried me into the maid's dayroom which nobody used. We did it there on an old bed.
'We' did it? Whattaya mean? Didn't he force you?
'We' did it? Whattaya mean? Didn't he force you?
Well, sure. But he was super-gentle, you know? I mean, he raped me and all, but I guess there's all different kinds of rapes. I didn't exactly want him to do it but I suppose once it started, it didn't seem all that terrible. It was over pretty quick, and after Uncle Pooch just stood there and pulled up his trousers and left me

And you never told nobody about it?
And you never told nobody about it?
Just you. Uncle Pooch never acted strange or different after. And he never did anything else to me. I always got a nice present from him at Christmas, like a coat or jewelry?

Uncle Pooch died in a car crash three years later while he was holidayin' in Myrtle Beach. They still got way too much traffic there for my taste... And another thing, baby... That government of ours should be keepin' us separated from outer space...
