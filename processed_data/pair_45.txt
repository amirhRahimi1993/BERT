Oh --
But you couldn't have been, could you?
That dog's a menace to the community. I'm taking him to the sheriff and make sure he's destroyed.
Destroyed? Toto? Oh, you can't! You mustn't! Auntie Em! Uncle Henry! You won't let her, will you?
Now you're seeing reason.
No --
No --
Here's what I'm taking him in -- so he can't attack me again.
Here's what I'm taking him in -- so he can't attack me again.
Oh, no, no! I won't let you take him! You go away, you....! Oooh, I'll bite you myself!
Here! I've got an order! Let me have...
Stop her!
Oil can.....Oil can....
Did you say something?
Did you say something?
Oil can....
Where do you want to be oiled first?
My mouth -- my mouth!

Oh...
Oh --

No -- it feels wonderful. I've held that axe up for ages. Oh ---
No -- it feels wonderful. I've held that axe up for ages. Oh ---
Oh, goodness! How did you ever get like this?
Oh, goodness! How did you ever get like this?
Oh -- well, about a year ago -- I was chopping that tree -- minding my own business -- when suddenly it started to rain....
...and right in the middle of a chop, I...I rusted solid. And I've been that way ever since.
Well, you're perfect now.
Well, you're perfect now.
My...my neck. My...my neck. Perfect? Oh -- bang on my chest if you think I'm perfect. Go ahead -- bang on it!
My...my neck. My...my neck. Perfect? Oh -- bang on my chest if you think I'm perfect. Go ahead -- bang on it!
Oh --!
Oh --
All hollow. Oh --
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, are you all right?
I'm afraid I'm a little rusty yet.
I'm afraid I'm a little rusty yet.
Oh, dear -- That was wonderful! You know -- we were just wondering why you couldn't come to Emerald City with us to ask the Wizard of Oz for a heart.
Oh, dear -- That was wonderful! You know -- we were just wondering why you couldn't come to Emerald City with us to ask the Wizard of Oz for a heart.
Emerald City? Why, that's a long and dangerous journey. And it might rain on the way.
Well, suppose the Wizard wouldn't get me one when we got there?
Oh, but he will! He must! We've come such a long way already.
Oh, but he will! He must! We've come such a long way already.
Ohh -- what's that? Oh --
Oh! They're - they're gone now.
Oh, goodness! Did any of them sting you?
Oh, goodness! Did any of them sting you?
I - I guess they tried to, but they bent their stingers.
I - I guess they tried to, but they bent their stingers.
Oh, dear. I don't know what I'd do if a whole swarm kept -- Oh! Oh! Oh, there's one on me!
Oh, dear. I don't know what I'd do if a whole swarm kept -- Oh! Oh! Oh, there's one on me!
Oh - I'll get it!

Oh! Oh!
Oh --
Oh, see - I killed it. Oh, I killed that poor little honey bee!
Oh, see - I killed it. Oh, I killed that poor little honey bee!
Oh-oh-
And I was standing over there rusting for the longest time.
Still, I wish I could remember. But, I guess it doesn't matter anyway. We know each other now, don't we?
We might.
Oh --
And bears!
What sort of an animal is that?
What sort of an animal is that?
It-it-it-it - it's a huge one!
And him a brain.
I'm sure he could give you some courage.
Can't that female take no for an answer?
Oh --
Oh, he's just ascared again.
Don't you know the Wizard's going to give you some courage?
No. Why only -- Oh --
Oh! Oh, Tin Man! Oh!
Oh! Something bit me, too!
Now come on - you're acting silly --
Dorothy!
I knew you would!
Tomorrow? Oh, but I want to go home now.
You've had plenty of time already!
Ahh --- Oh, it ticks! Listen!
Yes...!
...yes.
Look -- it ticks!
Now I know I've got a heart -- 'cause it's breaking.
Oh -- Goodbye, Lion. You know, I know it isn't right, but I'm going to miss the way you used to holler for help before you found your courage.
Oh, my!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my!
Oh, my!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my!

Oh, my!

Lions and tigers and bears!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my!
What -- what did you do that for? I didn't bite him.
No, but you tried to.
It's bad enough picking on a straw man, but when you go around picking on poor little dogs --
Well, you didn't have to go and hit me, did you? Is my nose bleeding?
Well, you didn't have to go and hit me, did you? Is my nose bleeding?
Well, of course not. My goodness, what a fuss you're making. Well, naturally, when you go around picking on things weaker than you are -- Why, you're nothing but a great big coward!
Well, of course not. My goodness, what a fuss you're making. Well, naturally, when you go around picking on things weaker than you are -- Why, you're nothing but a great big coward!
You're right -- I am a coward.
...has been simply unbearable.
Oh.
Oh.
Yeh, it's sad, believe me, Missy When you're born to be a sissy, Without the vim and verve. But I could show my prowess -- Be a lion not a mou-ess -- If I only had the nerve I'm afraid there's no denyin' I'm just a dande-lion -- A fate I don't deserve. I'd be brave as a blizzard --
A home --
The nerve.
It's beautiful, isn't it? Just like I knew it would be. He really must be a wonderful Wizard to live in a City like that!
Well, come on, then. What are we waiting for?
Yes -- let's run!
Yes.
Oh -- unusual weather we're having, ain't it?
Look! He's rusted again. Oh, give me the oil can -- quick! Oh-oh, quick!
Ho -- ho --ho -- ho
Hah!
Who's her? Who's her?
It's the Witch! She's followed us here!
Oh, but -- but please. It's very important.
And -- and I got a permanent just for the occasion.
I'll be home in time for supper!
In another hour, I'll be King of the Forest. Long Live the King! If....
Your Majesty, if you were king You wouldn't be afraid of anything?
Not nobody, not nohow!
How about a hippopotamus?
Why, I'd thrash him from top to bottomamus!
Why, I'd thrash him from top to bottomamus!
Supposin' you met an elephant?
Supposin' you met an elephant?
I'd wrap him up in cellophant!
I'd be too scared to ask him for it.
Oh, well, then -- we'll ask him for you.
Oh, well, then -- we'll ask him for you.
I'd sooner wait outside.
I'd sooner wait outside.
But why? Why?
But why? Why?
Because I'm still scared!
Because I'm still scared!
Oh, come on.
Oh, come on.
Ohh!
Oh -- Oh, come on.
Huh? What'd he say?
Does it work?
No, but it's wonderful for threatening with.
No, but it's wonderful for threatening with.
Oh --
That noise don't come from no ordinary bird.
It may be just a cricket Or a critter in the trees.
As Monarch of the Forest I don't like the situation.
Are you gonna stand around And let 'em fill us full of horror?
Are you gonna stand around And let 'em fill us full of horror?
I'd like to roar 'em down -- But I think I lost my roarer.
Oh -- Oh -- Oh! Toto -- Toto!

Lion, darling -- I knew you'd come!
They're coming back!

...Ain't it the truth! Ain't it the truth!

Oh, now I'll never get home!
Stay with us, then, Dorothy. We all love you. We don't want you to go.
Stay with us, then, Dorothy. We all love you. We don't want you to go.
Oh, that's very kind of you -- but this could never be like Kansas. Auntie Em must have stopped wondering what happened to me by now. Oh, Scarecrow, what am I going to do?
Well -- I would never've found it if it hadn't been for you.
I think I'll miss you most of all.
Now lookit, Dorothy, you ain't using your head about Miss Gulch. Think you didn't have any brains at all.
I have so got brains.
I have so got brains.
Well, why don't you use them? When you come home, don't go by Miss Gulch's place. Then Toto won't get in her garden, and you won't get in no trouble. See?
Well, why don't you use them? When you come home, don't go by Miss Gulch's place. Then Toto won't get in her garden, and you won't get in no trouble. See?
Oh, Hunk, you just won't listen, that's all.
Oh, Hunk, you just won't listen, that's all.
Well, your head ain't made of straw, you know.
Why, Zeke, -- you're just as scared as I am!
What's the matter -- gonna let a little old pig make a coward out of you?

It's pleasant down that way, too.
Down? No, you see, I'm -- Well, -- I'm --
Oh, well, here -- let me help you.
Oh, well, here -- let me help you.
Oh, that's very kind of you -- very kind.

Whhhooops! Ha-ha -- there goes some of me again!
Oh -- does it hurt you?
Oh -- does it hurt you?
Oh, no -- I just keep picking it up and putting it back in again.
Oh, no -- I just keep picking it up and putting it back in again.
Ohhh --
Ohhh --
My, it's good to be....
...free!
Oh! Oh! Ohhh!
Oh! Oh! Ohhh!
Did I scare you?
Did I scare you?
No, No -- I -- I just thought you hurt yourself.
Wonderful! Why, if our Scarecrow back in Kansas could do that, the crows'd be scared to pieces!
They would?
They would?
Um-hmm.
Um-hmm.
Where's Kansas?
Where's Kansas?
That's where I live. And I want to get back there so badly I'm going all the way to Emerald City to get the Wizard of Oz to help me.
That's where I live. And I want to get back there so badly I'm going all the way to Emerald City to get the Wizard of Oz to help me.
You're going to see a Wizard?
You're going to see a Wizard?
Um-hmm.
Um-hmm.
Do you think if I went with you this Wizard would give me some brains?
Do you think if I went with you this Wizard would give me some brains?
I couldn't say. But even if he didn't, you'd be no worse off than you are now.
I couldn't say. But even if he didn't, you'd be no worse off than you are now.
Yes -- that's true.
Yes -- that's true.
But maybe you'd better not. I've got a witch mad at me, and you might get into trouble.
But maybe you'd better not. I've got a witch mad at me, and you might get into trouble.
Witch? Huh! I'm not afraid of a witch! I'm not afraid of anything --- except a lighted match.
Witch? Huh! I'm not afraid of a witch! I'm not afraid of anything --- except a lighted match.
I don't blame you for that.
I don't blame you for that.
But I'd face a whole box full of them for the chance of getting some brains. Look -- I won't be any trouble, because I don't eat a thing -- and I won't try to manage things, because I can't think. Won't you take me with you?
Hooray! We're off to see a Wizard!
Oh -- well -- you're not starting out very well.
Oh -- well -- you're not starting out very well.
Oh, I'll try! Really, I will.
Oh, I'll try! Really, I will.
To Oz?

Oh, dear -- I keep forgetting I'm not in Kansas.
Come along, Dorothy -- you don't want any of those apples. Hmm!
Hooray! I guess that did it! Help yourself.
Oh --
Why, it's a man! A man made out of tin!
What?
What?
Yes. Oh -- look --
Oil can what?
Oil can? Oh -- oh, here it is!
He said his mouth.
Here -- here --
Here -- here --
The other side....
The other side....
Yes --- there.
But you've just been saying how much you want a heart.
And I'll keep the oil-can handy.
...just that the Witch is so wicked. I don't think you two ought to come with me because you'll get into trouble.
Oh, you don't think we're going to stand by and let her get away with fireballs and bees, do you?
Oh, you're the best friends anybody ever had! And it's funny, but I feel as if I've known you all the time. But I couldn't have, could I?
I don't see how. You weren't around when I was stuffed and sewn together, were you?
I don't like this forest! It's -- it's dark and creepy!
Of course, I don't know, but I think it'll get darker before it gets lighter.
Of course, I don't know, but I think it'll get darker before it gets lighter.
Do -- do you suppose we'll meet any wild animals?
Oh, that's too bad. Don't you think the Wizard could help him, too?
I don't see why not. Why don't you come along with us? We're on our way to see the Wizard now. To get him a heart.
...along.
Oh, no -- please. I have to rest for just a minute. Toto!
It does help. Dorothy, you're waking up!
Oh --
Yes -- there --
Oh -- here quick -- oh! - we'll oil him up.
-- A hot water bottle would be good if we had one.
Oh, he's been crying! Why have you been --
Dear, whatever shall we do?
Well, we'd better hurry if we're going to see the Wizard!
Oh --
Looks like we came a long way for nothing.
Looks like we came a long way for nothing.
Oh -- and I was so happy! I thought I was on my way home!
Oh -- Oh --
Oh -- are you -- are you all right?
Oh, come on now - everybody --
Did you just hear what I just heard?
No -- No -- No -- No!
Ohh! OHH! OHH!
Ohh! OHH! OHH!
Help! I'm burning! I'm burning! I'm burning! Help! Help! Help!
Who killed my sister? Who killed the Witch of the East? Was it you? Answer me!
Leave her alone!
Leave her alone!
You stay out of this! I'm here for vengeance! So it was you, was it? You killed her,....
...ting the ruby slippers?
The slippers -- yes.....the slippers!
The ruby slippers! What have you done with them? Give them back to me, or I'll ---
It's too late! There they....
You stay out of this, Glinda, or I'll fix you as well!
Oh, rubbish! You have no power here. Be gone, before somebody drops a house on you, too.
Oh, rubbish! You have no power here. Be gone, before somebody drops a house on you, too.
Very well -- I'll bide my time -- and as for you, my fine lady, it's true, I can't attend to you here and now as I'd like, but just try to stay out of my way....
Real courage. That's what we want.
You do? boys, you're aiming low. You not only surprise, but you grieve me.
Yeah.
Ah --
Ah --
Dorothy next!
Dorothy next!
Yes. Dorothy -- ah -- Dor --
...excellence to the Miracle Wonderland Carnival Company -- until one day, while performing spectacular feats of stratospheric skill never before attempted by civilized man, an unfortunate phenomena occurred. The balloon failed to return to the fair.
It did?
Comin' to think of it, forty winks wouldn't be bad.
Don't you start it, too!
What if it were a brontosaurus?
I'd show him who was King of the Fores'!
Would...would it do any good if I roared?
Who at?
Who at?
I don't know.
Wait a minute, fellahs. I was just thinkin'. I really don't want to see the Wizard this much. I better wait for you outside.
What's the matter?
What happened?
Somebody pulled my tail.

Up!
Now...
Come on -- I've got another idea.
Do -- do you think it'll be polite -- dropping in like this?
Stop pushing!
Oh - I was only trying to help. Ohhh!
Where -- where do we go now?

Yeah!
Sneaking up on me, eh? Why!
Here -- here. Go 'way and let us alone!
Here -- here. Go 'way and let us alone!
Oh, scared, huh?
I haven't slept in weeks.
Why don't you try counting sheep?
Why don't you try counting sheep?
That doesn't do any good -- I'm afraid of 'em.
Dorothy!
Dorothy! You can't sleep here! You can't sleep in the middle of a field!
Not even a rhinoceros?
Imposserous!
From now on, we're on enemy ground. You should have something to protect yourself with.
She - she can have my Witch Remover.
What's that? What's that? Take it away - take it away - Take it away!
Hold still - hold still --
It's a whatzis.
It's a whatzis?

Oh, poor Dorothy. We may never see her again.
There. Now, that's the best we can do without any pins.
Yeah --

B-B-B-B-B-But if we do that, we'll have to kill her to get it!
Beautiful! What an echo!
It's empty. The tinsmith forgot to give me a heart.
I'm not afraid of her. I'll see you get safely to the Wizard now, whether I get a brain or not! Stuff a mattress with me! Hah!
I'll see you reach the Wizard, whether I get a heart of not. Bee-hive -- bah! Let her try and make a bee-hive out of me! You know -- Hmm? What's that?

You know something?
Oh, I think I see a jijik And he's fuzzy and he's furry I haven't got a brain But I think I ought to worry!

They tore my legs off, and they threw them over there! Then they took my chest out, and they threw it over there!
Well, that's you all over.
Who do you suppose they were? And where did they take her? A fine thing - to go to pieces at a time like this!
Now, now, don't fret.
Now, now, don't fret.
Oh, dear, dear.

Oh, don't worry about me. I'm all right. We must worry about Dorothy.
But how can we find her? We don't even know where she is. Look! There's....
...to Dorothy!
Oh --
Oh --
Come on, fellows!
Oh, I hate to think of her in there. We've got to get her out.
Don't cry now. We haven't got the oil-can with us and you've been squeaking enough as it is.
No, you don't.
Oh, no!
Whew! That wasn't my plan - but something happened, didn't it?
You put up a great fight, Lion.
You put up a great fight, Lion.

I don't know what we'd have done without you.
Oh - upstairs, quickly!

Therefore, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Universitatus Committeeatum e plurbis unum, I hereby confer upon you the honorary degree of Th.D.
Th.D.?
How can I ever thank you enough?
Well, you can't. As for you, my fine friend -- you're a victim of disorganized thinking. You are under the unfortunate delusion that simply because you run away from danger, you have no courage. You're confusing courage with wisdom. Back where I come from, we have men who are called heroes. Once a year, they take their fortitude out of mothballs and parade it
As for you, my galvanized friend, you want a heart! You don't know how lucky you are not to have one. Hearts will never be practical until they can be made unbreakable. I could have been a world figure, a power among men, a - a successful wizard, had I not been obstructed by a heart.
But I still want one.
But I still want one.
Yes -- ....
Stop that dog!
This is a highly irregular procedure! This is absolutely unprecedented!

He is an impostor. Theres no Davidov at Miratom.
Heres your imposter. Hes paid off the men on the plane outside. Theyre not taking the bomb to any Russian facility, theyre flying it wherever he tells them.
Shame you had to spot I wasnt the real thing.
So who are you?
So who are you?
Bond --
They wont get far. Every warhead has a locator card. A Miratom device. Emits a high-pitched signal on Russian emergency frequencies. We can track the bomb.
With this?
When this is over we should bury the hatchet. Celebrate. A champagne dinner?
When this is over our bodies may be blown to smithereens.

Nuclear.

Made to look just like an accident.
But why? Eight million people would die, the land irradiated for a hundred years. A cloud of radiation the size of Europe...
Because an explosion like that would kill all the other pipelines. There would be only one way to get the oil out of the Caspian and pump it to the world...

The King pipeline.
The King pipeline.
Elektra would control it all.

If I dont get to the Boa before he gets to Maidens Tower, M is dead.
Is there another way?
We go down to the torpedo bay.
Hes sealed himself in.
Hes going to insert the plutonium.
Do you know what youre doing?
Like riding a bike.
What kind of bikes did you ride?
Just wanted to put him on edge...
Count to twenty. When you get to twenty open the hatch. It can only be opened for a few seconds or well sink.
But what if...

We cant.
I love Christmas in Turkey.
So isnt it time you unwrapped your present?
Dislocated collar bone. If any more tendons snap... It wont just be two weeks out of action.
I need you to pass me fit now, Molly.
Its just a scratch.
James. It wouldnt really be...
Then maybe Id be... open to that.
Perhaps after this ... test?
Perhaps after this ... test?
...yes?...
...yes?...
I could come for a second opinion?
Constructions not exactly my line.
Quite the opposite, in fact.
Old friend?
Since Oxford. I knew him when he had nothing but a brilliant mind and enough guts to conquer the world. Hes a man of great integrity.

Elektra? Running King Industries? Ive known that girl all her life. Im not sure she knows what shes walking into.
Shes not a girl anymore.
Ive scheduled a medical for you.
Its barely a scratch. The Dome broke my fall.

Well, at least it turned out to have some purpose.
007. What do you know of the Caspian Sea?
Caviar capital of the world. Matchless beluga. Firm, yet subtle. Largest landlocked body of water on Earth. Oil-rich. Hitler wanted it. Stalin beat him to it.

And now its up for grabs, a goldrush. Far more oil than anyone thought.
Who told you to look at Elektras files?
I took the initiative.

The amount of money that killed Robert King is the same amount as the ransom demand for Elektra.
Its a message. He wants us to know hes back.
Who?
Who?
Claude Serrault. A.K.A...
Claude Serrault. A.K.A...
Renard.
Sir Robert tried to deal with the kidnapping with his own...resources, at first. When Elektras ear was delivered to him in the post, he came to me. I advised against paying the ransom. I knew it was Renard. I played it out as long as possible to get a fix on him.
Sacrifice the girl to take out the terrorist?
Sacrifice the girl to take out the terrorist?
How many deaths is he responsible for? How many innocent people? You may only get one shot at a man like Renard. Same circumstances, Id do the same again.
He survived?
The doctor who saved him couldnt get it out, so Renard killed him. When Interpol found the x-rays, there was mild jubilation. Effectively, hes a dead man.
The bullet is moving through the medulla oblongata, killing off his sense of touch. He feels no pain. He can push himself harder, longer than any normal man.
That which does not kill me makes me stronger.
That which does not kill me makes me stronger.
Now Robert is dead. He got his revenge.
Now Robert is dead. He got his revenge.
Hes not through yet. Renard doesnt blow up five million dollars unless he knows theres more coming in. Hes working for someone. Someone who wants to stop the pipeline. And they hired the perfect killer. One with a vendetta against King...and you.
Get out to the pipeline. Find the insider who switched the pin. If your instincts are right, Renard will be back. He hasnt completed the job. The pipeline is still going forward, and we have Elektra to thank for that.
The worm on the hook again.
The report King bought. Its a manual. Renards men used it to remove this radio tracking device from the warhead.
Then Robert was right about a Russian connection.
Then Robert was right about a Russian connection.
Theyre getting their weapons from the Russians, but where are they getting the money to buy the weapons? I cant help thinking...the person close to King, the one who switched that pin...

Not the usual Swiss procedure, Mr. Bond, but you understand, a man in my position..
Which is neutral, no doubt.
I did not get the report from an MI-6 agent.

Stripped of all your weaponry, you still threaten me?
The name?
I cant tell you... Alright, alright! But you must protect me!
I see my friend Davidov ran into some difficulty.
Indeed.
Revenge isnt so hard to fathom. Whats clever is getting someone else to pay for it.
Not many people in this world have that kind of fortune.
Who is it?
You think I fear death? I welcome it. I get on my knees and pray for it. You, on the other hand, you have something to live for, no? Shes beautiful isnt she? You should have seen her before. Flawless, and still so innocent, not such a whore in bed...
You will never touch her. You will never get near her.
Have you forgotten who saved your life in Geneva?

You even brought the plane for us. We really couldnt have done it without you.
In case youve forgotten. Im dead already.
Havent you heard the news? So is she.
Beautiful, isnt it?
Yes.
Today, of all days, the sun decides to shine.

You knew him well?
He was my father.
Im sorry.
Im sorry.
He died before he could complete his lifelong dream. I intend to finish it for him.
I met you at my fathers funeral.
Yes.
Yes.
I havent been able to recall a single moment of that day...until now.

Since the kidnapping. Why do you ask?
Does this look familiar to you?
Its my fathers pin. He wore it everyday of his life.
Are you trying to break my heart? Or is it just your way with women?
Its not the pin your father wore. Its an exact duplicate. Inside is a tiny electrical detonator. We have reason to believe the assassin had an inside accomplice, someone who worked at this company.

If youve come here to look after me, Mr. Bond, thank you, but no thank you. I have two bodyguards, I dont need a third...
The killer doesnt want to see this pipeline continue, doesnt want to see you take over...
Thats every man within a five mile radius. Including you. Thats why youre here, isnt it? You think I cant do it. You think Im going to screw up. Or get myself killed.

You are wrong, Mr. Bond. In fact, I am the only person who can do it.
I have to check the upper lines. Gabor will drive you back.

You dont take no for an answer, do you?

Oh my God...were buried alive...
Were alright.
I cant stay here.
Youre not going to.
No! It will cave in!
Its the only way out...
I cant stay.
I know.
The way I acted, in the snow...you must think Im a coward.
I think youre one of the bravest people Ive ever met.
What is it?
...you should rest.
James...
I have to go.
I have to go.
Then take me with you.
Then take me with you.
No. Youll be safe here.

I dont want to be safe!

I have to go to work.
Vodka martini.
Two. Shaken not stirred.
What the hell are you doing here?
Someone wants to kill me, Id rather die looking him straight in the eye. What are you doing here? Looking for a woman a little more your type? How about that one?
If this little show is for my benefit, Ill take you home right now.
You had your chance, James. Now Im looking for a bigger thrill.
I understand its normally good practice to get the feel of the cards before going off the deep end.
Really?
Surely you believe in living dangerously.
Not at that price. Time to surrender.
You knew when you first saw me. You knew it would be like this.
Shush.
How did you survive?
I used my body on the guards. It gave me control. I got to a gun and I took my chance. Ive never told anyone that.
Whats wrong with you? Are you crazy?
A little. Does it matter? After all, whats the point of living if you cant feel alive? Isnt that right, Elektra? Isnt that your motto?

Or did you steal it from your old friend Renard?

...what?
...what?
We had a run-in, he and I. He knew about us, he knew about my shoulder, he knew exactly where to hurt me...
Are you saying...Renard is the man whos trying to kill me?
You can drop the act, its over.
You can drop the act, its over.
I dont know what youre talking about!
I dont know what youre talking about!
I think you do.
How dare you! How dare you! That animal!? That monster!? He disgusts me! You disgust me! So he knew where to hurt you, is that it? You had a sling on your arm at the funeral! I didnt have to sleep with you to find that out.
He used your exact words.
He used your exact words.
You knew. You knew all the time, that he was out there, that he was coming for me, and you lied. You used me, you used me as bait. You made love to me -- what, to pass the time as you waited for him to strike?
Im coming with you.
You do what you have to do, but Ive called in M. Shes en route from London even now.
I could have given you the world.
Not interested.
Wheres M?
Soon shell be everywhere.
All this, because you fell for Renard?
Five more turns and your neck will break.
Since I was a child, Ive always had a power over men. When I realized my father wouldnt rescue me from the kidnappers, I knew I had to form a new alliance.
You turned Renard.
You turned Renard.
Just like you...only you were even easier.
So you killed your father.
He killed me! He killed me the day he refused to pay my ransom.
Was this all about the oil?
It is my oil! Mine and my familys!
It runs in my veins, thicker than blood. Im going to redraw the map. And when I am through the whole world will know my name, my grandfathers name, the glory of my people.
No-one will believe this melt-down was an accident.
Know what happens when a man is strangled?
Elektra, its not too late. Eight million people neednt die.
One... last... screw?
Oh James.

You are out of your league. Shes working with Renard.
Now...where were we?

A rope!
No. The truth! She thought I was dead -- those blades were meant for you. What do you know that she would kill you for?
Alright, alright! Sometimes I smuggle machinery for her. Russian stuff.
And the payoff on the tables?

Where?

The right kind of explosion in the right spot -- it would block the Bosphorus, cut off the Black Sea.
The Maidens Tower.
How appropriate.

Id heard there were some renovations there...no one would look for a sub in that place in a million years.
What?
To haul some cargo. My nephew, he is Captain of a sub in the Black Sea Fleet.
No! Bond!
Bond!
What is this place?
Former KGB surveillance post. The Dye Factory was just a front; now it turns a good profit.
In the good old days, the KGB had three or four spots where our submarines could surface without anyone knowing. But Yevgeny is supposed to be loading cargo.
What class sub does your nephew run?

C-class.
Ill send someone out.
Could...could you come?
Perhaps this isnt the time...
Please.
Your people? Your people will leave you here to rot just like you left me. You and my father. He didnt think my life was worth the chump change he spent on a day at the stock market.
Your father...
Your father...
Is nothing. His kingdom he stole from my mother. The kingdom I will rightly take back.
Now you know how it feels. To be locked away, to wonder if theyre coming for you, if anyone will ever come for you.
Someone will come.
Someone will come.
Who? Bond? Bond is dead.
Warm.
Is it?
So beautiful. So smooth, so warm.
How would you know?
Why are you like this? Because Bond is dead? Its what you wanted.
Of course...
He was a...good lover?
What do you think?
This is the end.
No. It is the beginning. The world will never be the same.
Everythings under control up here. Are you ready?
Yes. Au revoir...
Weve been pawns in someones game. They tricked us into bringing the money to King. Not just elaborate. Cock-sure.
And expensive. Cost three million plus.
Do we have the range of Renards plane?
Anywhere in this circle. Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria, Afghanistan...

Thirty minutes maximum. Of course, I assume we'd be in the fortified command bunker at the time of the launch order.

Hello, Adrian.
The bearer of bad news.
We've lost a colleague. The Comedian is dead.
Rorschach's on the case. He's got Dreiberg in a lather. He seems to think that someone is "stalking" the Watchmen.

Life and death are unquantifiable abstracts. They don't concern me.
I guess you'll be dismantling Russian tanks soon.
You mean Afghanistan? It won't require my attention. What I'm doing here is far more interesting.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, VEIDT?
Jon! Get back! You don't understand.
Blake? Dead?
Yes. I heard this morning. Washington's asked me to attend the funeral as a matter of protocol.
I'm here, Laurie.
Is it time? D'you have to leave for the funeral?

Not yet, there's plenty of time.
Would you like me to stay?

The atmosphere. I'm sorry. These things slip my mind.
Jesus, Jon, I nearly choked to -- where are we --
This whole place is ticking. Does it -- keep time?
Yes. In about . . . thirty seconds, for example, you'll tell me you're sleeping with Dreiberg.
Yes. In about . . . thirty seconds, for example, you'll tell me you're sleeping with Dreiberg.
You -- you know about me and Dan?
Jon, does anybody know what the hell you're talking about? Dan's just an ordinary guy, but he talks to me. When he looks at me he's seeing something more than just a -- a collection of atoms.
Then you're sleeping with Dreiberg?
Then you're sleeping with Dreiberg?
Well, I just, you just said -- don't act surprised.

That's how time works, Laurie. Everything is preordained . . . even my responses. We're all puppets. I'm just a puppet who can see the strings. -- Thirty seconds.
Jon -- there's something I have to know. Did you love me once?
Yes, I loved you. I left the earth when I lost you.
Yes, I loved you. I left the earth when I lost you.
Yet you must've known all along that you'd give me cancer. Just be being with me.

Then it's going to happen. The world's going to end. -- And you've always known.
Always. Ever since the day I died.
Then why don't you . . . do something about it!
Because --

I can't stand any more of this. I want to go back. If I'm going to die I want to be with -- other people.
Please, Laurie. Not yet. I've got eons stretching before me, a universe to explore. I'll be alone. You're the last human being I'll ever see.

I see what the watchmaker made. I see the universe!
The Comedian. He's dead. Murdered. That's all I know.
My God. Murdered? -- What's this have to do with Rorschach?
My God. Murdered? -- What's this have to do with Rorschach?
It's -- he's got some kind of conspiracy theory. He thinks someone's . . . I don't know, stalking us.
It's -- he's got some kind of conspiracy theory. He thinks someone's . . . I don't know, stalking us.
Us. You mean the Watchmen.
I know, I know, it's just -- he's back on the street, he smells blood.
You know how he is. He goes on these binges, kills a couple of thugs -- then he's satisfied. It blows over.

He's bound to get caught. I don't want my name coming out. Not at this late date.

If he comes here, I'll handle him. Remember -- I've always protected you. Haven't I? Do you need money?

No. I just wanted you to --

You did the right thing, Daniel. Let's stay in touch, okay? Good night.
You did the right thing, Daniel. Let's stay in touch, okay? Good night.
Good night.
Who?
I don't know, but . . . in the wake of all that's happened, I'm starting to think Rorschach may have been right. Is Laurie okay?
I don't know, but . . . in the wake of all that's happened, I'm starting to think Rorschach may have been right. Is Laurie okay?
She's with me.
She's with me.
Good. Be careful, Daniel, don't let up your guard. Look, I'm going to head south for a while -- hole up at Karnak until all this blows over. You two would be welcome to join me.
Good. Be careful, Daniel, don't let up your guard. Look, I'm going to head south for a while -- hole up at Karnak until all this blows over. You two would be welcome to join me.
Thanks for the offer, Adrian. I'll let you know.
Yeah. See, I've been working on a little project. Top secret, of course . . .
The missing scientists.
The missing scientists.
Uh huh. You might recognize the names. Quite a few of them worked at Gila Flats.
What??
I couldn't let him interfere with my project.
It is Jon. Twenty-four years ago. Before he turned into Dr. Manhattan.
Good Lord. How'd you get it on tape?
Good Lord. How'd you get it on tape?
It's not on tape. It's live. We're watching it happen.
Gentlemen, the past. Unfolding before your eyes. Stand back from the field. It'll blow you to bits.
What is it? How does it work?
What is it? How does it work?
It's a tachyon chamber. It generates subatomic particles which flow backward in time. There are other worlds, Daniel, other timelines -- existing parallel to our own --

Adrian -- you've lost it.
Adrian -- you've lost it.
I've seen them! I've seen them in there.
Don¹t be obtuse, Daniel. If I kill Jon in the past, none of this will happen. We won¹t even be here, will we?
And what if you¹re wrong?
And what if you¹re wrong?
I¹m not.
I¹m not.
What if you¹re wrong??
What if you¹re wrong??
Then I¹ve been a very bad boy and you¹ll have to spank me. Christ! I¹m doing what I have to do to save the godforsaken human race!!
Your problem, Dan, is a lack of vision. You spent all those years chasing after muggers, and drug dealers, and jaywalkers . . . as if the world was any better for it. As if any of it mattered.
You ruthless son of a bitch. You really believe this mad-scientist bullshit is going to save the world?
You ruthless son of a bitch. You really believe this mad-scientist bullshit is going to save the world?
We'd better hope so. -- It's almost time.
Sorry, it's this thing with Blake. I mean, you don't really think anyone's out to get us -- do you?
Dan, are you really that paranoid? Let's face it, Eddie Blake was no Mother Teresa.

Now wait. We all had the same option as Blake. It was work for the government or do time.
Fine, but the Civil Terrorism Unit? It's a fucking Gestapo! Dirty tricks -- political assassinations --
Okay, okay. You made your choice. You went underground. Some of us made other choices.

Damn straight.
Damn straight! We were heroes.
Damn straight! We were heroes.
Of course, we looked like idiots in those bondage outfits.

That's the one. Whatever happened to him?
That's the one. Whatever happened to him?
He pulled it on Rorschach . . . and Rorschach dropped him down an elevator shaft.
Christ yes, I went in for a cancer scan first thing. Gave me a couple of rough nights, I'll tell you . . . How about you, Laurie?
Oh, yeah. They gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the hell out. No expense account. No place to live.
Oh, yeah. They gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the hell out. No expense account. No place to live.
You'll find something. -- I should go. You and me, seeing each other, someone might put two and two together . . .
They're not following me, Dan. I mean -- Jon's gone, we're right on the brink of World War III. Nobody cares about the Watchmen.
Maybe not, but why take chances?
Maybe not, but why take chances?
Dan, what are you so scared of? I mean, me, I've spent all these years keeping Jon together, and now that it's over I feel -- I feel glad. I'm finally free to, to go out and live my own life, and --
Laurie, wait. I've got a spare room. It's empty. If you'd like . . . LAURIE Oh Daniel, thanks, but I couldn't. You'd just be all nervous about --
No, screw that. What you were saying before, it's absolutely right. -- I'd love to have you stay.
No, screw that. What you were saying before, it's absolutely right. -- I'd love to have you stay.
You're sure?
Oh. No. Sorry. I'll be right down the hall if you want me . . . I mean, if you need some aspirin, or --
I'm gonna take a warm bath and sack out. -- You've been really sweet. Sleep tight, okay?
His what?
His . . . whatever.
His . . . whatever.
I'm not his . . . whatever. Okay?
I told you I was a little bit out of step. A lot of the old stuff I listen to -- it never came out on crystal.
I'd say you stalled out about forty years ago. Nellie Lutcher -- Louis Jordan -- I've never even heard of these people.
I'd say you stalled out about forty years ago. Nellie Lutcher -- Louis Jordan -- I've never even heard of these people.
Play one. Educate yourself.
No wonder Adrian's rich. You use that stuff?
Sure. It works. I mean, look at this face, Daniel. I'm thirty-eight years old!
Sure. It works. I mean, look at this face, Daniel. I'm thirty-eight years old!
I don't mind getting older. I'm obsolete anyway. Why try to hide it?
I don't mind getting older. I'm obsolete anyway. Why try to hide it?
I like the way you look. It's strange with Jon. He doesn't age. His face doesn't change. But you, Daniel, you look . . .

Not at all. You look very -- dashing. Here, you pick one.
. . . What?
. . . What?
Pick a record. I feel like dancing.
Eight cops? Oh, great. A jury's gonna love that.
Are you kidding? If they put him in jail he's dead. He'll never get to trial.
I just realized. I'd never seen his face. I guess it was just a matter of time. He's totally -- Daniel? What's wrong?
The Comedian . . . Jon . . . now Rorschach.
Ohh. I could use some dinner. Who was that on the phone?
One more down. Someone tried to kill Adrian. . . . First time I've ever heard him scared.
-- What is it.
I know what you're thinking. You'd be a lot safer if I weren't around.

With any luck, the world'll end before we get ours.
Enough is enough, Daniel. Where exactly are we?
Memory lane.
The Owlship. I can't believe it.
-- I thought it was time for a routine maintenance check.
I took her out a couple of summers back. Scared the hell out of some cows. -- I wonder if she'd make it down to Antarctica.
Antarctica??
Antarctica??
Adrian's headed down to his secret retreat. He invited us to come along. I've been thinking. If things do get nasty . . . it wouldn't be a bad place to sit out a war.

Would you want to sit out a war? I mean -- what would be left.
You and me.
Dan! The spare costumes! I can't believe you kept them.
Me neither. Mine barely even fits. The thing is, I try to remember why we did it, and I can't. Helping people, or righting wrongs, or trying to save the world . . . I don't know. It all seems so abstract.
God, you sound like Jon. -- Turn around.
What are you up to?
What are you up to?
Don't look. Turn around.
This'd better not be what I think it is.
Okay!
What the hell -- ?
It's a peace rally. The CTU's just opened fire on the crowd.
It's a peace rally. The CTU's just opened fire on the crowd.
Oh, Laurie. Jesus. No.
They're following us.
All right. Mission accomplished.
Missed 'em Dan. You're aiming high!
I don't want to take 'em out. Just want to keep 'em interested.
I don't want to take 'em out. Just want to keep 'em interested.
They're practically on us . . .

That Detroit shit? I'm so worried.
What?
The costumes. Am I right?
No way. I'm not that much of a pervert.
Yes you are.

No offense, Laurie, but it was Silk Spectre I had the crush on. Tonight was the first time I've felt like myself in ten years.

It's because there's nothing to be afraid of anymore. The world's about to end. I feel like I could save it.
You're full of yourself. What are you doing?
Long as we're on the subject of perverts . . . I miss Rorschach. Let's spring him.

My God! We bust him out of jail, in the middle of a riot, and he stops to take a --
I beg your pardon . . . ? Some gratitude.
Will you two lovebirds keep it down?
Welcome back, Night Owl.
What now? Fly south -- hook up with Adrian?
What was he doing?
Trying to change the past. He said it was the only way to save the world --
He saved himself. He changed the past.
Where did he go?
Dan, is this -- is this New York??
Those cars. What year is this??
Those cars. What year is this??
Everything's changed --
Dan -- what do we do now?
Wherever we are, it's better than what we left. Backs together --
Wherever we are, it's better than what we left. Backs together --
We'll tell them what's happened. They'll listen to reason, won't they -- ?
Hiya, pardner. Long time no see.
Did anybody follow you? See you come here?
Sure. You got some kind of -- bean juice on it.
Human bean juice. The Comedian is dead.
So do I. So do you.
Rorschach, that was a long time ago. I mean, that -- that's just paranoia.
Maybe. Or maybe somebody's finally caught up with us. Somebody with a grudge. Thought you might want to spread the word.
Hey. Hey. If you don't mind, use the back stairs, all right?
. . . That was quick.
Toilet clogged. Short fat turd. Let's get out of here.
I don't know if you heard. A hired gunman tried to off Adrian.
Veidt's a fool. Tried to warn him about new information. Sicced his mangy cat on me.

Are you saying that someone would risk starting World War III just to get back at us? What about all those poor shits with cancer?
How do we know they've got cancer? Could be part of massive propaganda scheme . . .
Come on, Rorschach. Gimme a break --
Where's Laurie?
I don't think she's coming with us.
We're running, Rorschach. We've got no place to go. We're hightailing it down to Adrian's.
Veidt's assassin. Leads to follow. Can't just --

Sorry, Daniel. You've always been a good friend. I know that. Sorry about Laurie.
Okay, let's just . . . thank you.

Adrian -- you? You killed Blake, and --
. . . And they call me a fucking nut.
Adrian. It¹s too late. The world is blowing up as we stand here.
I'll say. If we ever get off this looney-tune project, I'm gonna head straight for civilization and buy me a big thick steak.
With lots of ketchup?
Nothing wrong with ketchup.

Sphinx brand. When I got out of weapons design, I wanted to move into a more . . . humanitarian area. I was thinking: what would do some good in the world? And I thought: why not a genetically-altered tobacco, that no only doesn't cause cancer -- but cleans out your lungs as you smoke it? In fact I think I'll have one now.
Thanks, no. But it's a wonderful product. Now Adrian -- your old colleague Dr. Manhattan has just left the planet amid rumors --

Sit down, Miss Juspeczyk. As I mentioned, the people in this file are all close associates of Dr. Manhattan. They have something else in common as well. They've all developed a fairly . . . exotic form of lymphatic cancer.
What are you saying? That Jon is radioactive?
I'm terribly sorry.
What does this mean? What does it --

Please.
He's a little farther gone every time.
Stay, Adrian. I just -- every once in a while, I need to talk to someone human. He doesn't think like we do. He doesn't even feel what we feel. I mean -- he even scares the research teams.

Gila Flats -- place where Jon turned into . . .
Dr. Manhattan, right. Now if you boys care to join me, we'll go save the world.
Veidt. You're the one who started World War III.
No. I just hastened the inevitable. He's been ready to blow for years. I knew all it would take was a little push. So I, uh . . . gave his friends and associates cancer.
Call off the cat and I'll kill you, Veidt.
Before you do that, you might want to look at what I've been looking at.

He's pulling a 211 with a "trucker", who happens to be packing a cop issue H&K 9mm. I get tipped that something is going down when she passes me a note. How's that for twisted
Most guys we ran through this either took off or helped them rob the place. I expected you to do the same.

You've really got me confused, Cage. On the one hand you showed leadership, courage under fire, a willingness to protect men you hardly knew... and on the other you have an arrest record that pegs you as near sociopathic. Help me out here. I'm not following your evolution.

No, it's like a safety. We are going to have to access the manual controls.

A manual control on a moving torpedo. This day keeps getting better and better.
It's running three meters down. Twenty knots.
It has to surface to release the nerve agent, right?

By then it's too late! The only way to safely dispose of the nerve agent is in deep water! The chemicals will break down and dissipate!

Use your grenades! Maybe we can blow it up underwater!
I can't believe my mission is finally over. I don't even know what to do with myself.
You can't welch on me now. We had a deal.
What are you doing?
It's about your next mission. You need to be debriefed.
Nothing. He had two days.
Perhaps he is not all he says he is.
What are you doing?
It all happened so fast. Such an unfortunate accident.
What was that for?
I'd forgotten how exciting it is working together.

Why don't we go below decks and work off some of this adrenaline.

The Peace conference...
Nice place to start, don't you think?
Hate those Russkie choppers. Rattle- trap pieces of garbage. I'm agent Shavers. Toby Lee Shavers. I'm looking for what's his name. Three X' s.
That's would be me.
Back off, just go away you klutz. Alright, here's the story. The items in these cases belong to me. I designed them, built them, and was going to use them in the field myself until you showed up.
I stole your beat, huh? Guess you forgot to brown-nose the right people.

Is that supposed to be funny? I'm not laughing. I've worked for ten years to get my shot at being a field agent, funny boy. And ar the last minute I get bumped by you, some reject from the Ozzfest.

Why don't you show me some gear before you get hurt.

Listen to you. Right away, sir, anything you say, sir.
Miniature power cams set in on contact, giving you a sure grip on any surface.
They come in any other styles or colors?
This is your standard dart gun.
That one I'm real familiar with.
I think I'll hang on to these.
Think again, that's government property. You have to sign for everything. I've got one more that wasn't on your list.
From the Beastie Boys collection?
It's a stakeout suit. It's got food, water, recording gear, anything you need for covert spying. It's all- weather, fire retardant, and if you give this buckle a sharp pull, the whole outfit deploys into a parachute.

You're joking, right?
Now that I've given you the overview, we're going to spend the next couple hours going into extensive operational detail.
I thought that was in detail.
Hey, you don't need all this just to go on vacation. Unless this ain't for going on vacation...
I'm through, Xander.
I'm through, Xander.
I can see that. Why?
I can see that. Why?
You run around with maniacs jumping motorcycles in the desert, you break 36 bones crashing wave runners and snowboarding off cliffs, all with no health insurance... It's insane, I can't take it anymore.

You have all this talent, and you waste it. You won't take a single endorsement deal. Meanwhile those other guys have their own video games! But no, you've got too much "integrity" for that.

I don't wanna go mersh, you know that. But hey, if this is about money...
French Polynesia? This wouldn't last us a week in a cheap hotel. Do you know how expensive it is down there?
Alright, so I'll get more.
Alright, so I'll get more.
It's not about the money, X! You never plan for anything. I can't live like that anymore, I need some stability.

Well if you're bailing, I guess I'd better give you your surprise now.
What...?

Of course I'm serious. I bought it, didn't I?

You can't just propose to me out of nowhere. You think that's going to solve our problems? I'm sorry, X. It was a kick for a while, but it's over. You're just not going anywhere.

You're not exactly "going anywhere" yourself.
You're wrong about that. I'm heading out that door right now.
Sit down.
I've been on a plane for twelve hours, I think I'll stand.
My name is Slovo, Czech secret police. When you are here you are under my jurisdiction, you take my orders, you do what I say. If you become any kind of an inconvenience, I'll shoot you.
Here we go again.
Here we go again.
You're here because your government is putting pressure on my government. This is an internal affair, a Czech affair, that you are interfering with. I will warn you once: Don't shit in my lawn. Get whatever information your government seeks and get our.

First of all, you should kill whoever sold you that suit. Two, I don't wanna be here either, so just step off. Three, if you had the authority to shoot me you would've done it by now, so just ease up on the machismo, bitch. Now that we've got that sorted out, I'm gonna get some rest.
Nice hops.
The corner. Anarchy 99.
I'll leave you two alone to talk.
Yeah, thanks a lot.
Dude, what are you doing here?
You killed me, remember? Now I have to hide out here with you. Where have you been?
I found something big enough for us to take these guys down with. They've got a of nerve agent they're gonna unleash.
Is this what you're looking for?
Sorry, "dude".
What's the deal?
What's the deal?
Oh come on, don't feel bad. You got played, so what? You're new at this. Did you think you could just stroll into this business one day and have all the angles figured out?
Oh come on, don't feel bad. You got played, so what? You're new at this. Did you think you could just stroll into this business one day and have all the angles figured out?
Why you dogging me up?
Why you dogging me up?
They came and found me. They said they'd kill me unless I help them. Plus they offer me a lot of money. No big deal. These things happen. Dump your gun on the floor.
What's so damn funny?
Been to any good diners lately?
Heads up, man. What's this thing on my back?
A parachute. This does not argue well.
Who's writing this dude's dialogue?
He's a pretty good actor, though.
Help me with this guy.
It's like you said, every man for himself.
They're all over the place! What the hell's going on?
Looks like we're in the middle of the drug war.
That's the guy.
This pizda? Never seen him before.
This pizda? Never seen him before.
Who you workin' for? What do you do for a living, dickhead?
Cops. Like a plague. No matter how many you pay there's always another with his hand out. How did you pick him out?
He flashed his badge to half the bar when he bought his drink.

I appreciate you bringing this to our attention. Whatever you want, the rest of the night, consider it on the house.
Thanks, but I'm here on business. I heard you're the G around here. I'm looking for some cars, expensive ones. A lot of them.
Sorry, man, don't know what you're talking about.
Sorry, man, don't know what you're talking about.
I'm talking about the sports cars that disappear off the docks in Genoa and wind up here. If you don't know about 'em, who does?
I remember that one where you jump the motorcycle over the freeway at rush hour.
When else are you gonna do it?
We seen all your shit! So you want cars? We get whatever cars you need. What are you looking for?
Ferrari's, Lamborghini's... high end pasta rockets. Ten to start.
Don't look at me, X, she handles all the details.
It'll work faster if I have an account number.
Very nice. I'm impressed.
I'm somewhat less so. We seem to have a bit of a problem...
I had to inspect the merchandise first.
Of course.
What's this?
This is a gift. From me to you.
What's going on, my friend?
You tell me! You got a sniper up there or what?
You tell me! You got a sniper up there or what?
He's not with us, Xander. He must be with you.
He's not with us, Xander. He must be with you.
Bullshit! You get your boy off that roof or I swear to God I'm gonna give you another hole to breathe out of.
I don't believe it! You can't shoot a cop in the middle of the street!
Had to do what I had to do.
Total chaos, man! Welcome to Anarchy 99!
What's "Anarchy 99"?
What's "Anarchy 99"?
It's all this craziness! It's what we've been living since 99, when we left the Army. One of our brothers died in Grozny and we said the hell with this shit. What for? He dies for what? Politics? Who's politics? Not ours.

You wanna see my politics?
Screw the world. If I'm gonna die for something, it better be bitches and money.
That's what I'm talking about, man! That's why Anarchy 99 was born.
To us it means no walls, no speed limits, no jails. It's everybody does what he wants. People think democracy is freedom but they don't have a clue. There's an old punk song. It says: "America stands for freedom, but if you think you're free..."
"...try walking into a deli and urinating on the cheese". 'Anarchy Burger' by the Vandals.
"...try walking into a deli and urinating on the cheese". 'Anarchy Burger' by the Vandals.
You got it, man. It's stupid but it's true. True freedom is when you do whatever you want anytime you want. That's when you know you're living, man.

How you gonna do that with government and rules everywhere?

Easy. You get enough money that you grow an ass big enough for the whole world to kiss.
You got a great set-up here Yorgi. You really know how to live.
It's a beautiful town, Prague. It's been good to me.

Hell no. My dad was a straight up tin soldier. Somehow he pissed this general off and got himself dishonorably discharged. Had a court martial and everything. The charges were total bullshit, so he was sure he'd get his name cleared, but it didn't happen.

My old man, he bought into the system, and it screwed him. So he swallowed a bullet. Me, I don't believe in nothing I can't see and touch.
I've got meetings this afternoon, I've got to get some sleep. Just pick a girl.
That's alright, I'm kinda tired.
That's alright, I'm kinda tired.
You want to insult me? This is my hospitality. Pick one.
That was for Anders.
Don't forget goatee boy. I greased him up on the diamond run.
And you. Why do you have such a problem staying away, my friend? Did you miss us that much?
I wanted to get the hell out of Prague before Silent Night falls.
I wanted to get the hell out of Prague before Silent Night falls.
Not bad, man, not bad. You put things together quick. Prague it is.
What's the gimmick, Yorgi? That's the part I don't get. You gonna hold the world hostage with your gas bombs? I didn't think you were dumb enough to go with that hack cliche.
You think I'm after money? I told you, my friend. Anarchy. Time for a change. Money is good, but for true freedom you have to get rid of the rules themselves.

Easier than that, buddy. I'll get them to destroy each other. You kill an entire Peace conference, someone is going to have to pay. Then our friend Ahab continues down the river to the ocean and begins his world tour. London, Cairo, Beijing... Pretty soon everyone's involved. These guys bomb those guys, those guys invade these guys. Soon the whole world is like your

And here I thought "anarchy" was just something cool to put on a Tshirt.
Come on, Xander. You used to stand for something. What happened to you, man? I thought you'd get it.
You both could have been a part of it. You could have ridden with us into a new day, the dawning of a new age of --
Oh just shoot us already. I'm sorry I asked.
What does that mean?
The neuro-filter acts like a surge protector, regulating the infinite flow of information from Cerebro to the Professor's mind. It's what keeps him from being crushed by the consciousness of millions.
Thomas Edison knew how to make the light bulb. He had the energy source. He had the vacuum. But he didn't have the filament. He tried metal after metal but nothing would hold to power.
... until he found tungsten.
I wish I could go.
We all do.
We all do.

Beast.
Can the Professor repair his own mind?
I'm afraid without Cerebro's help, he won't have the strength to heal himself -- And without the neuro- filter... there's no Cerebro.
It appears as though Magneto has built a machine which somehow triggers the mutator gene in normal human beings. And he is using Adamantium as its core.
Its core?
Correct... Apparently, Adamantium is the only metal strong enough to hold the energy this machine produces. He used the Adamantium in Logan's dog tag to test it on the Senator. And I assume now he plans to use the rest of Logan's skeleton for a larger demonstration.
For what purpose?
For what purpose?
Yes -- Only there's a problem. The mutator gene is not responding to the radiation the way it would in mother nature. It's forcing the body's cells to replicate thousands of times faster than they're accustomed to. The Senator's body is literally burning itself out. Scott -- this machine kills people and I don't think Magneto realizes it.

So where do you think he's planning this larger demonstration?
Scott.. I -
I don't like him being here.
I don't like him being here.
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
You saw what happened tonight. You think Magneto won't come after him again. You think he won't come here if necessary. This is a school, for God's sake.
You saw what happened tonight. You think Magneto won't come after him again. You think he won't come here if necessary. This is a school, for God's sake.
If Magneto is planning to use Logan for some terrible purpose it's our responsibility to do something.
What's wrong with him?
His vital signs are weak and getting weaker.
He's already losing control of his vitals. Respiratory. Cardiovascular. Unless we manage to replace the filter by tomorrow morning, I'm afraid.
We have to find Magneto.
Are you all right?
No. I'm... I don't know if we can do this without Charles.
Hey. I'm sorry. About Logan. I was jealous.
Well, I think that's perfectly understandable.
Well, I think that's perfectly understandable.
I'll tell you one thing though.
I'll tell you one thing though.
What's that?
What's that?
He calls me sport one more time, and I'll blow a watermelon-sized hole through him.
Radar Stealth Mode checks out. All right, there'll be less security north of the George Washington Bridge. I'm taking her down.
Into the Hudson?
Into the Hudson?
Uh-huh.
I'm going to assume that means that the Secret Service is out of commission. Jean, can you raise me up there?
It's too far.
It's too far.
Storm, Rogue, -- you take the south entrance. Jean and I will go in here.
Jean... can you?
I'm sorry. I'm not strong enough.
Inspiring -- Now what am I doing here?
I wanted to talk to you.
How long have you been in Alaska?
I don't remember. Is that what you wanted to ask me?
I've served with men like you before. Methodical. Systematic -- Naive. You know what happens to those men in a real fight?
You know, you --
You know, you --
Shut up. I got no interest in you, Xavier, or your... X-Men.
I'm o.k. I'm o.k.
Sure you are, sport.
Anything else I can get you?
Some cigars. Case of beer.
Some cigars. Case of beer.
There's no smoking or drinking on the school grounds.

I won't light the cigars - how about that?
I won't light the cigars - how about that?
I'll see what I can do -- You should get some sleep. Even with your healing ability, you're going to be hurting for a while.
I'll see what I can do -- You should get some sleep. Even with your healing ability, you're going to be hurting for a while.
What if I like the pain?
The Professor said you were a solider. Actually, I believe he used the word mercenary.
Yeah? Well I don't like to talk about my past.
Yeah? Well I don't like to talk about my past.
Maybe, the Professor could help you with that.
Maybe, the Professor could help you with that.
By reading my thoughts?
By reading my thoughts?
If necessary.
If necessary.
What if they're naughty?
You should always work with a spotter.
He's busy right now.
I was thinking maybe you and me could go into town.
Were you now?
Were you now?
What do you say?
What do you say?
Not interested.
Let go.
Suit yourself.
He's uptight.
He takes his work seriously.
He takes his work seriously.
He takes himself seriously.
He takes himself seriously.
What is it you're failing to get at? Are you interested in me?
Logan, do you see this ring?
I've seen a lot of rings.
I've seen a lot of rings.
Yeah, I'll bet you have.
You're avoiding the question I posed to you at the beginning of the hearing, Ms. Grey. Three words: Are mutants dangerous?
I am avoiding a question that is decidedly loaded, Senator. The wrong person behind the wheel of a car can be dangerous.
Ms. Grey -- you work at a school for mutants in Westchester, New York. Can you tell the members of this committee what exactly you are teaching these mutants?
Math. History. Science. English. Athletics --
Math. History. Science. English. Athletics --
You wouldn't happen to be teaching them how to use their powers to --
You wouldn't happen to be teaching them how to use their powers to --
Control, Senator... we teach them control.
This was taken by a state police officer in Secaucus, New Jersey. A man in a minor altercation literally melted the car in front of him. I don't know where you come from, Ms. Grey, but where I come from, you don't go melting people's cars when they cut you off. You do it the old fashioned way -- you give 'em the finger.
I presume nothing, I am here to tell you that in time, the mutator gene will activate in every living human being on this planet. Perhaps even your children, Senator.
I presume nothing, I am here to tell you that in time, the mutator gene will activate in every living human being on this planet. Perhaps even your children, Senator.
I can assure you, there is no such creature in my genes.
Dr. Grey.
Senator?
I'm sorry to come here, Ms. Grey. I was afraid if I went to a hospital, they would...
Treat you like a mutant? We are not what you think. Not all of us.
Treat you like a mutant? We are not what you think. Not all of us.
Tell it to the ones that did this to me.
The mutant gene tells the body when it needs to change.
I can assure you, there is no such creature in my genes.
You... wha... Who are you... Where is Henry?
Mr. Guyrich has been dead for some time Senator.
Mr. Guyrich has been dead for some time Senator.
You mutant bastards...
Whatever you do to me... no matter what you'll make me right. Every word I have spoken will be confirmed.
Gosh, I hope so.
The intention of registration act -
INTENTION? Intention, Senator? We are talking about mankind here. His fear. It is only a matter of time before mutants will be herded into camps. Studied for weaknesses. And eventually wiped off the face of the Earth.
What is it you intend to do to me?
Let's just say, God works too slowly.
I do love a good check mate.
What do you want?
What do you want?
Come with me and I'll let her live.
Come with me and I'll let her live.
You think I care about her? I'm the only one who's sure to walk out of here.
Where am I?
You're backstage at the encore of creation.
What are you going to do?
In the road to survival, there is always sacrifice Logan. We are the future... not them. We must protect ourselves. After tonight, when the leaders of the world return home -- They will return as brothers, as mutants... and our cause will be theirs. This is survival, I know you understand that, Logan... or is it Wolverine?
What am I doing here?
I brought you here so that you would be safe from Magneto.
I brought you here so that you would be safe from Magneto.
Who?
Who?
A very powerful mutant who for some reason has taken an interest in you. I'm not sure why, but until we find out, I must ask you to stay.
Forty-eight hours, old man. But if you cross me, I won't feel any guilt about what I do to you.
Deal.
The point of what?
This. This whole God damn thing. Making yourselves into some sort of "team" of super-powered freaks. Teaching wayward mutants about classical literature. For what?
The point is to step into a more evolved position of social responsibility. To recognize that there is a world out there and that we mutants are as much a part of it as normal human beings.
What if it never happens? What if they're so afraid of us that we become the enemy? -- This place is gonna be one giant cemetery.
Now that's Magneto talking.
No. That's me talking. And you know what? It's only been thirty-two hours and you still have no idea what this guy wants with me.
No. That's me talking. And you know what? It's only been thirty-two hours and you still have no idea what this guy wants with me.
I believe he wants you for your Adamantium.
Where are we going?
To find Rogue.
To find Rogue.
How?
How?
The brainwaves of mutants are quite different than those of the average human being.
You designed this yourself?
Actually, Magneto helped me put it together.
Actually, Magneto helped me put it together.
He helped you?
He helped you?
We were friends once... But that was a long time ago.
I've found her, Westchester Mall.
I'll go.
Don't you knock?
They're all asking how you're doing. Are you feeling up to saying hello to everyone?
They're all asking how you're doing. Are you feeling up to saying hello to everyone?
Actually I'm feeling up to leaving.
Why? You have a home here now, if you want it. Everyone will...
What?... miss me? Charley, I'm gonna walk out the front door and trust me, it won't be soon enough for everyone here.
Why is everybody up at sunrise?
The sun is setting, Logan. You've been asleep for nineteen hours.
The sun is setting, Logan. You've been asleep for nineteen hours.
What did she do to me?
What did she do to me?
She borrowed your power to save her life. When she touches someone, she absorbs their strengths -- their gifts. In your case -- your ability to heal. That's why she keeps her body covered.

I felt like she almost killed me.

If she held on any longer she could have.
If she held on any longer she could have.
And you think it helps calling her Rogue?
I lost him.
How?
How?
It was Xavier's people. They knew.
Is that what you're looking for?
A piece. Only a piece.
A piece. Only a piece.
Is it enough?
Is it enough?
Enough for a test.
I'll find him.
ALIVE.
I'll never understand your regard for them, Charles.
And I'll never understand terrorists.
And I'll never understand terrorists.
I am trying to save our kind, Charles. You should do the same.
I am trying to save our kind, Charles. You should do the same.
Not at the cost of lives, Max.
The two in Alaska. Just how do you people manage to be in the right place at the right time? Still tinkering with Cerebro?
What do you want with him?
Is that so?
Still trying to make the world safe for our kind. Still trying to find a way to introduce ourselves -- definitively.

You definition of definitive was always a bit extreme for me, Max. What is it like these days?
You definition of definitive was always a bit extreme for me, Max. What is it like these days?
Let's just say that I am out to make some radical changes. Now come on Charles. For old times sake, for your sake... Leave him to me.
If I could make you understand. If you could just be made to see it the way I do. The way it's going to be.
The way what is going to be?
The way what is going to be?
I'm going to change the world with or without you as a witness, Charles. And this one gets a front row seat.
I'm going to change the world with or without you as a witness, Charles. And this one gets a front row seat.
What do you mean to do?
This checkmate goes to you. I didn't want to hurt anyone. But you leave me no choice.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN TO DO?
I wouldn't really have let you die, you know. I just needed...
I know.
Doesn't it ever wake you in the middle of the night? The feeling that some day, some day very soon, they will pass that foolish law - or one just like it - and they will come for you and your children? Take you all away?
It does indeed, Max.
It does indeed, Max.
And what do you do when you wake up to that?
And what do you do when you wake up to that?
I feel a great swell of pity for the poor soul who comes to that school again looking for trouble.
Excuse me, Mr. Waldman -- excuse me for interrupting. But is Frederick, then...a medical doctor?
Yes, my dear, he is.
Yes, my dear, he is.
And has he achieved...any special degree of eminence?

He is the fifth leading authority in his field.

Oh, shit.

Herr Falkstein -- you must go at once and present Dr. Frankenstein with all the details of his inheritance. The estate will provide for your journey.
Frederick Frankenstein?
You have the wrong house.

And who might you be?

Dr. Frederick Fronkonsteen.

No!
No!
What was your grandfather's name?
What was your grandfather's name?
Victor Frankenstein.
Forgive me for intruding so late at night, Herr Baron. But an ugly rumor has it that there are strange goings on in this castle. These good citizens are ready to rip you from limb to limb unless you can offer some rational explanation for their fears. How say you?
Ugly, vicious rumous.
They say, also, that you have recreated the horrible monster who, for so many years, has haunted and terrorized the God-fearing people of this village. What say you to that?
Poppycock!
I think we all need a good night's sleep. Why don't we meet next week and thrash this thing out?
Now wait a minute!
Where did you get this cauliflower?
From your office, sir.
From your office, sir.
Didn't you prepare it with the celery before my lecture?
Didn't you prepare it with the celery before my lecture?
Yes, sir. But I must have taken the wrong one when we came up.
Yes, sir. But I must have taken the wrong one when we came up.
Are you trying to make me look like an idiot?
No, sir. It will never happen again.
Here! This cauliflower is useless to me.
Give him an extra dollar.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
He has a big mouth. Yes! It seems to me I did read something about that incident as a student. But you have to remember that a worm -- with very few exceptions -- is not a human being.
Carlson!
Yes, sir?
Yes, sir?
Bring me some surgical gauze, a little tape and some disinfectant.
Bring me some surgical gauze, a little tape and some disinfectant.
Yes, sir. Do you want the other cauliflower?
Yes, sir. Do you want the other cauliflower?
... No!
Herr Falkstein! Did you inform Frederick Frankenstein of this assembly and all the particulars of the time and place?
I did, sir.
But I received a cable only this morning, saying that he could not come.
Was he aware of the importance of this occasion?
Was he aware of the importance of this occasion?
Yes, sir, he was. But he said he was obligated to lecture at Johns Hopkins University.
Yes, sir, he was. But he said he was obligated to lecture at Johns Hopkins University.
What lecture could be more important than the will of Baron Beaufort Frankenstein?
What lecture could be more important than the will of Baron Beaufort Frankenstein?
'Functional areas of the cerebrum in relation to the skull.'
Herr Falkstein! You have your instructions!
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
I have taken an oath that each letter of this testament shall be executed...and by God, it shall be done!
What in God's name are you doing?
Baack!
Baack!
What?

You're incorrigible!... Aren't you?
MMMmmmm.

All right then... seven's always been my lucky number.
MMMmm!
Is it that music?

MMMMM! MMMMM!
MMMMM! MMMMM!
Probably just some nearby cottage. Nothing to worry about.
Did you see?...I put a special hamper in the bathroom just for your shirts. the other one is just for socks and poo-poo undies.
MMmmm.
Still happy you married me?
MMmmm.

Love me oodles and oodles?

Love you! ...Well, why don't we turn in?
Darling!?!
I mean, it's been a long day. I'm sure you must be as tired as I am. Oh! These are my assistants: Inga and Ayegor.
Ready, darling?
Yes. I am a bit tired, after all.
Yes. I am a bit tired, after all.
Give me a hand with these, will you, Ayegor?
What a strange fellow.
Yes, he's a little bit... tilted. Harmless, though.
Yes, he's a little bit... tilted. Harmless, though.
Why does he call you 'master'?
Are you suggesting I call him master???
No, of course not. I just meant...
No, of course not. I just meant...
All right then!
Poor Delbruck! There must be some way to reach him -- to control that body.
Darling, you mustn't worry so.
But there's a genius inside that body -- crying out for love and understanding and normal human relationships. I just have to find some way to re-establish his communications system.
But you can't do that at night. And even if you could -- it would cost a fortune. Come to bed, darling.
But you can't do that at night. And even if you could -- it would cost a fortune. Come to bed, darling.
Oh, Delbruck, Delbruck. Was will dien tachlas von Dir?

You've done everything that's humanly possible, Frederick. Oh, darling, I'm so worried about you -- you need rest.
You've done everything that's humanly possible, Frederick. Oh, darling, I'm so worried about you -- you need rest.
I suppose you're right.
I suppose you're right.
Of course I am. Now come along like a good boy.
Is your room just down the hall? ... in case I get frightened during the night?
Yes, but... I thought, perhaps tonight, under the circumstances, I might... stay here with you.
Yes, but... I thought, perhaps tonight, under the circumstances, I might... stay here with you.
Oh, darling! Don't let's spoil everything.
I don't want to spoil anything -- I just want to top it all off.
Would you want me, now, like this, so soon before our wedding? ... So near we can almost touch it? Or wait a little while longer, when I can give myself without hesitation?... When I can be totally and unashamedly yours??
Would you want me, now, like this, so soon before our wedding? ... So near we can almost touch it? Or wait a little while longer, when I can give myself without hesitation?... When I can be totally and unashamedly yours??
That's a tough choice.

Is it worth taking a chance?
Is it worth taking a chance?
I suppose you're right.

Of course I am. Now give me a kiss and say good night like my good boy.
Good night.
That's my good boy.
I hope you find this comfortable. This was Baron Victor's room.
It seems fine.

You'll fine the keys to all the rooms in my cas... all the rooms in your castle on this ring. I'll leave it on the table here.
You'll fine the keys to all the rooms in my cas... all the rooms in your castle on this ring. I'll leave it on the table here.
Does that include the key to the laboratory?
You mean... the laboratory??
Yes!... the laboratory.

No! Dr. Frankenstein always kept that separate.

May I have it, please?
There seem to be quite a few books.
Yes, this was Victor's... the Baron's medical library.

I don't know what you mean, sir.

well, there was a public and a private library -- he said so in his will. these books are all very general -- any doctor might have them in his study.

I think you must be mistaken, sir.
Well... we'll see.
Will there be anything else?

I don't think so. Is my assistant taken care of?

I put her in the guest room, just down the hall.

Elizabeth!?! 'Can't waits any longer. Arrive in your arms at ten tonight.' Oh, God! Not tonight.
Dr. Frankenstein?
Fron kon steen!
Fron kon steen!
My name is Gerhart Falkstein.
Oh, at least, sir. The land alone is worth a small fortune.
But I can't just drop everything and leave. I have responsibilities and obligations.
But I can't just drop everything and leave. I have responsibilities and obligations.
Do you have a hundred thousand of them, sir?
How long will this whole thing take?
A week. Ten days at most.
A week. Ten days at most.
I'll have to think it over. It's not so easy just to pick up and...
Well... if you're sure that I could accomplish everything in a week... I suppose I could manage it.
Why did you do that?
Why did you do that?
What?
What?
Break that old man's violin.
Break that old man's violin.
I didn't do that.
I didn't do that.
The old violinist -- you smashed his violin over your knee.
All right then, I suppose I owe the family that much. You'll have everything ready for me when I arrive?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
One week at the most!?
One week at the most!?
One week -- I'll see to it, sir.
One week -- I'll see to it, sir.
Well, thank you very much for all your trouble.
Not at all -- a great privilege, Doctor.
Saturday night then! I'll take the train to New York and fly from there.
Saturday night then! I'll take the train to New York and fly from there.

That's 'Fronkonsteen.'
I beg your pardon?

But aren't you the grandson of the famous Dr. Victor Frankenstein?... who performed such fascinating experiments in electricity and galvanism?
But aren't you the grandson of the famous Dr. Victor Frankenstein?... who performed such fascinating experiments in electricity and galvanism?
That's true! But my grandfather, Victor was, after all, what we might politely refer to as... a cuckoo!
I prefer, by far, to be remembered for my own small contributions to science. Now if we can proceed to your questions.
Well sir... I'm not sure I understand the distinction between 'Reflexive' and 'Voluntary' nerve impulses.
Well sir... I'm not sure I understand the distinction between 'Reflexive' and 'Voluntary' nerve impulses.
Very good! Since our lab work today is a demonstration of just that distinction... why don't we proceed?
In conclusion... it should be noted that more than common injury to the nerve roots is always serious, because... once a nerve fibber is severed... there is no way to regenerate life back into it. Are there any more questions before we leave?
Dr. Fronkonsteen!
Dr. Fronkonsteen!
Yes?
Isn't it true that Darwin preserved a piece of vermicelli in a glass case until, by some extraordinary means, it actually began to move with voluntary motion?
A piece of what?
A piece of what?
Vermicelli.
Vermicelli.
Are you speaking of the worm, or ... the spaghetti.
But wasn't that the whole basis of your grandfathers work, sir...? the re-animation of component parts?
My father was a sick man.
My father was a sick man.
But aren't you the least bit curious about it, Doctor? Doesn't the secret of life hold any intrigue for you?
But aren't you the least bit curious about it, Doctor? Doesn't the secret of life hold any intrigue for you?
You are talking about the gibberish ravings of a lunatic mind.
Yes, but, sir... if it could be accomplished, wouldn't that eliminate disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death?
How old are you, young man?
How old are you, young man?
Nineteen, sir.
Nineteen, sir.
Nineteen! My dear young man... once the human organism has ceased to function, nature has deemed that creature to be dead.

You have more chance of re-animating this knife than you have of mending a broken nervous system,
But your grandfather's work, sir...

My grandfather's work was Doo-Doo! Dead is Dead! There's only one thing I am interested in... and that is the preservation of LIFE!

Well, they were wrong then, weren't they?
Well, they were wrong then, weren't they?
You were sent by Herr Falkstein, weren't you?
Yes, that's right. My grandfather and your grandfather used to pal around together. You and I should have a lot of laughs.
I'm sure we will.
I'm sure we will.
This is Inga. They thought you might need an assistant temporarily.
This is Inga. They thought you might need an assistant temporarily.
How do you do?
Are these your bags?
Yes, just the two.
Incidentally -- I don't mean to embarrass you in any way, but I'm a rather brilliant surgeon. Perhaps I can help you with that hump.
What hump?
There.

There wolf! There castle!

Why are you talking like that?

The wockers with the knockers.

Go ahead, play dumb! You'll lose your sockers and then be fockers.

I wonder what's got into them?
Aye-gor!

You didn't hear... nothing! Aren't there any lights in this place?
Two switches over there, but I wasn't going to be the first.
Did you see anyone else down here?
No, but when I first came in, there was a light coming from behind that steel door.
What is this place?
Must be the music room.
It is! This was my grandfather's private library. Look at this!
'How I Did It.' Good title!
'How I Did It.' Good title!
Funny it should just be lying out here on the table. I wonder what kind of dribble this is?
Taking the book along?
Yes, I think we could all use a good laugh.
What a filthy job!
Could be worse!
Could be worse!
How?
How?
Could be raining!
Very little decay. With this magnificent specimen for a body, all we need now is an equally magnificent brain. You know what to do!
I have a pretty good idea.
Do you have the name I wrote down?
Yes. Dr. H. Delbruck.
Yes. Dr. H. Delbruck.
I want that brain.
I want that brain.
Was he any good?

Hmm!
And he wrote seventeen cookbooks.

Yes! It's all written down in the notes. Tie off the kites and come down!
Yes! It's all written down in the notes. Tie off the kites and come down!
Yes, master. Just don't turn on any radios.
You'd better hurry -- I think it's going to rain.
All right... elevate me!
The ancient masters promised impossibilities and performed nothing. We shall penetrate into the recesses of nature. We shall ascend into the Heavens. We shall command the thunders of Heaven, mimic the earthquake and even mock the invisible world with its own shadows.
Tonight?

Yes! When I give the word -- throw the first switch!

But there must be a reason. This is science, not art.
Cold! Cold and dead!
You mustn't take it so hard. Bucharest wasn't built in a day.
Don't try to cheer me up that way.
Well, I don't like to see you mope.
You'll be getting me sad next.
I'm sorry. I don't mean to take out my frustration on you. You've been a great help to me, and I've let you down.
I'm not that sort you know. I appreciate you feelings, but try to show them some other way.
You're right! Self-pity never got anyone anywhere. Let's go back and finish our dinner.
Oh, do you like it? I'm not partial to desserts, but this is excellent.
Who are you talking to?
Who are you talking to?
To you! You just made a 'yummy' sound, so I thought you liked the dessert.

It wasn't me.
Better not get too close, master. This guy could kill you.
I suppose you're right. Inga! Prepare a sedative, just in case.
It's trying to talk. it wants us to take off the straps.
Don't fall for that one.

What's the point of my setup? It's not funny unless you repeat exactly what you said.
I'm not trying to be funny.
Repeat it anyway -- it's a wonderful cue.

Thanks...for all your help.
That's what we're paid for.
I'm a failure.
Come on, Froderick -- none of that.
What monster?
What d'ya mean "What monster?' You remember...the one we madein the basement.
You don't understand, Master. The big fellow's broken in and kidnapped your fiancee.
What???
What???
He's carrying her off now through the woods.
No! The only hope now is to get him back here. If I can just find a way to relieve the pressure on his cerebellum...
That sound good, boss.

Oh, just a little.
Nice! Nice little balance to it.
Ja, ja.
Extremely well.
How nice.
Did you have a pleasant trip?
Yes, thank you. It wasn't bad.
Did you ever have a roll in the hay?
I'm not sure I...get your drift.
Sometimes I'm afraid of the lightning.
Just an atmospheric discharge. Nothing to be afraid of.

Why don 't the Zulus attack?
Zulu may not wear shoes or trousers and the like but it don 't mean to say they got no brains. They'll watch us and wait and find our weaknesses.

Oh... indeed. Crealock, we should see that Colonel Dumford has an Officer for his hard riders. Perhaps a subaltern from the Twenty Fourth.
I thought it might be more effective to find someone who speaks Zulu.
Excellent. Thank you. Give them to Crealock, would you?
My Lord. This list was prepared for you. I don 't think another can understand its true value.
You intended to bring your reserves across the river?
I have received intelligence from, sources of my own that the Zulu Impis are moving North of here and threaten your left.

Intelligence? Sources of your own? Did it not occur to you they may be native rumours? Rumours to draw you off- to leave the whole ofNatal open to a possible counter thrust
Are you dictating the strategy of this war, Sir?
I'm explaining my reasons.
Tomorrow we will continue our advance on Ulundi. Dumford, kindly return to your unit Bring them here immediately to support Pulleine. Mr Vereker will join you as ADC. Do you understand me clearly?
And the threat of counter invasion no longer exists? 40
Yes. I see you've issued each of them with a Martini Henry Carbine. Our quota for Native contingencies: one rifle to ten men and only five rounds per rifle.
But will they make good use of them?
What's that strange name the newspaper chap's called?
Er, called Noggs, Sir Actual name is Norris-Newman. He presented credentials from "The Standard".
